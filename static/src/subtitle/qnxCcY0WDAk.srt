1
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:08,144
The room's a lot bigger than I thought I'd be getting,

2
00:00:08,204 --> 00:00:09,705
so I don't know if I should feel excited

3
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:12,526
or nervous about that, but in any case,

4
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,227
thank you for being here to hear me speak

5
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,588
about our skin texturing workflow

6
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:18,649
that we've been developing,

7
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:22,410
specifically in terms of how normal details are handled.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,351
And I'll be speaking about it from the angle

9
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:27,432
of how we developed it by drawing

10
00:00:27,552 --> 00:00:29,933
from environment texturing principles.

11
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:34,577
So before jumping into it, I'll just give a quick overview

12
00:00:34,777 --> 00:00:36,038
of what I'll be covering today.

13
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:38,681
So I'll start off with a brief introduction,

14
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:42,024
followed by a look at our previous skin texturing workflow,

15
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:44,086
the steps involved in that,

16
00:00:44,306 --> 00:00:47,689
and some of the issues that that raised.

17
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:50,752
Then I'll explain how the heck an environment artist

18
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:53,635
got involved with a skin texturing workflow for characters.

19
00:00:55,136 --> 00:00:58,257
After that, in developing this new workflow,

20
00:00:58,337 --> 00:01:00,678
it was really important that we understood

21
00:01:00,738 --> 00:01:02,279
what skin really looked like,

22
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:06,421
especially in terms of common patterns and characteristics.

23
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,903
So at this point, I would go over the steps that we did

24
00:01:09,963 --> 00:01:12,184
to try to understand human skin better

25
00:01:13,184 --> 00:01:15,626
and the conclusions that resulted from that investigation.

26
00:01:17,226 --> 00:01:19,327
Afterwards, building from these observations,

27
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,908
we designed this new skin texturing workflow,

28
00:01:21,968 --> 00:01:23,288
so I'll describe how that works

29
00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:26,249
and show some screenshots of our test results.

30
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,751
And then finally, I'll close off by sharing the ways

31
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:31,991
that we're trying to push this workflow even further

32
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,532
and then maybe answer some of your questions.

33
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:39,276
So, to start off, let me introduce myself.

34
00:01:39,777 --> 00:01:44,642
My name is Adele Bueno, and I'm the chief environment artist at Square Enix headquarters

35
00:01:44,702 --> 00:01:45,302
in Tokyo.

36
00:01:46,063 --> 00:01:51,769
I've worked on environments in past games, such as Bloodborne, The Last of Us, Uncharted

37
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:53,931
3, and most recently Final Fantasy XV.

38
00:01:55,592 --> 00:01:57,594
And currently I'm part of a group called

39
00:01:57,654 --> 00:01:59,275
the Advanced Technology Division.

40
00:01:59,816 --> 00:02:02,037
And we're a central technology group,

41
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:04,559
or a multidisciplinary central technology group.

42
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,441
And at Square Enix, there's a bunch of different games

43
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:10,043
that are being developed for several platforms

44
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,945
using all different kinds of technology.

45
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:15,968
So at ATD, we're responsible for developing tools

46
00:02:16,168 --> 00:02:19,310
and pipelines and workflows for all these different games.

47
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:23,112
And our department is pretty engineer-heavy,

48
00:02:23,713 --> 00:02:26,334
but we do have two artists, one of whom is me,

49
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:29,136
and the other being Eduardo Mozena,

50
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:31,177
who is the chief character artist,

51
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:33,258
and was actually the one who kick-started

52
00:02:33,298 --> 00:02:36,039
this whole investigation when he decided to look

53
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:38,040
at the previous skin-texturing workflow

54
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,321
that was in place at the time.

55
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:42,622
So this is where we started.

56
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:43,983
This is Agni.

57
00:02:44,683 --> 00:02:46,364
She was created for a tech demo

58
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:48,245
that was released about four years ago.

59
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:53,332
And the method that was done to texture this character

60
00:02:53,812 --> 00:02:55,932
was basically that same workflow that was in place.

61
00:02:55,992 --> 00:02:57,452
So for normal details,

62
00:02:58,253 --> 00:03:00,333
that was basically handled by two maps.

63
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:04,234
The map that did basically all of the heavy lifting

64
00:03:04,414 --> 00:03:07,835
was a sculpted custom one-to-one normal map.

65
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:10,295
And this handled all the facial details

66
00:03:10,915 --> 00:03:13,356
from micro detail or tertiary detail,

67
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:16,856
which is like tiny pores and micro wrinkles,

68
00:03:17,617 --> 00:03:20,919
all the way up to primary and secondary details

69
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:21,960
or macro details.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,524
So that includes folds, pockets of fat, large scars,

71
00:03:26,564 --> 00:03:29,026
basically the large forms that you'll see on the face.

72
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:33,270
And because of the amount and range of detail

73
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,631
that this map needed to cover,

74
00:03:35,151 --> 00:03:38,134
the resolutions for this one-to-one needed to be pretty big,

75
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:41,897
so at least 2K, even 4K for cinematics,

76
00:03:41,977 --> 00:03:45,139
and in some special situations, even bigger than that.

77
00:03:46,592 --> 00:03:48,854
We also used the Tiling Micro Detail Map.

78
00:03:49,274 --> 00:03:51,176
This one was shared across all characters.

79
00:03:51,937 --> 00:03:55,260
This was a lot smaller, and it was basically just a generic noise.

80
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,184
And the purpose of this map was to add some texture, so to speak, to the skin.

81
00:04:00,284 --> 00:04:02,446
Basically, it's to break up that spec a bit.

82
00:04:04,057 --> 00:04:06,077
Now, there are a couple issues with this workflow,

83
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:08,038
and there are two main ones that we identified.

84
00:04:08,698 --> 00:04:11,519
The first one, obviously, was the texture size.

85
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,741
So, a minimum 2K map, just for a single character,

86
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:18,221
just for a small part of a single character model,

87
00:04:18,602 --> 00:04:19,642
we thought was a bit much.

88
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:22,523
But because this map had to handle

89
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,544
really fine, tiny, poor details,

90
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:26,704
that resolution was necessary.

91
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:31,266
But even still, even using 2K or even 4K resolution,

92
00:04:31,306 --> 00:04:33,187
we still weren't really happy with the results.

93
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:37,790
Now the second issue was with the micro detail map.

94
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,672
So since we were using just a generic noise,

95
00:04:41,252 --> 00:04:43,574
it wasn't actually useful in terms of adding

96
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:45,936
meaningful detail to the face model.

97
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:49,738
But also the pore types on faces differ so much

98
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:52,280
on different parts of the face that we also couldn't

99
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,922
get away with just choosing one actual pore type

100
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,244
and then applying that uniformly throughout the face.

101
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:01,019
However, we did notice one thing,

102
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,621
and that was with the unique map, the custom map,

103
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:06,223
that was unique for each character.

104
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:10,327
So if you ignored the micro details

105
00:05:10,387 --> 00:05:12,328
and just focused on the larger forms,

106
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:14,230
the primary and secondary details,

107
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,692
they could all actually be represented

108
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:18,754
by much lower texture resolutions.

109
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:22,457
So we could go all the way down to 1K, even 512 maps,

110
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:25,239
which is significantly lower than what we were using.

111
00:05:26,802 --> 00:05:28,723
But of course, what about the tertiary details?

112
00:05:29,243 --> 00:05:33,105
And it was this need to represent this range of details on the same map,

113
00:05:33,546 --> 00:05:37,047
the need to display small details and wider forms at the same time,

114
00:05:37,448 --> 00:05:39,309
that was the root of all of our problems.

115
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:42,950
But when broken down in this way, when phrased in this particular way,

116
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:45,872
it actually started to seem like a familiar challenge.

117
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:48,389
And that's because it was.

118
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,370
Basically, this is the same kind of challenge

119
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,051
that environment texture artists face on a regular basis.

120
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,852
So I'm assuming there's gonna be

121
00:05:56,892 --> 00:05:58,733
some non-environment artists in the room,

122
00:05:58,773 --> 00:06:00,673
so just to kind of give a quick overview

123
00:06:01,114 --> 00:06:02,934
of what it's like to texture environments.

124
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,295
Environments tend to have much lower memory budgets

125
00:06:06,395 --> 00:06:08,996
relative to the amount of assets that we have to create,

126
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,777
which can range in size from small pebbles

127
00:06:12,837 --> 00:06:15,938
and grains of sand all the way to big mountains, right?

128
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,144
And so to deal with that, the majority of the textures that we use are tiling textures.

129
00:06:21,885 --> 00:06:26,091
And to create even more variations, we'll blend these different tiling textures together.

130
00:06:26,611 --> 00:06:29,956
And this allows us to maintain fidelity at close distances,

131
00:06:30,476 --> 00:06:32,699
while still keeping texture sizes fairly low.

132
00:06:34,204 --> 00:06:36,305
So we thought, why not give this a try for skin?

133
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:40,688
Now the idea of texturing characters using tiling textures

134
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:42,409
is not really a new concept.

135
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:45,170
So we were already kind of doing it before

136
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,671
with that micro detail map.

137
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:49,192
And for cloth, for instance,

138
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:51,734
it's being this technique of using tiling textures

139
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:55,276
is being used for cloth weaves to add detail to fabric.

140
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,837
So maybe we were onto something,

141
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,699
approaching skin as if it were an environment.

142
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:02,480
It was worth a try at least.

143
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:06,973
So when approaching environment art creation,

144
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:09,477
the first step is to try and identify

145
00:07:09,537 --> 00:07:12,982
the basic common elements that you can repeat throughout.

146
00:07:13,623 --> 00:07:17,128
So for skin, obviously this meant starting with pores.

147
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:24,374
But we didn't want to just jump in without first gaining an understanding of the patterns that make up skin.

148
00:07:25,095 --> 00:07:29,478
So what we wanted to do first was to try to find the common pore patterns

149
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,962
that are found across most, if not all, faces in terms of shape and placement.

150
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:37,725
And that meant looking at a lot of reference.

151
00:07:38,346 --> 00:07:40,528
So what we did was we gathered photos,

152
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:43,311
and then I went around and scanned several faces

153
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:44,052
in the office.

154
00:07:44,693 --> 00:07:46,274
And honestly, as an environment artist,

155
00:07:46,294 --> 00:07:47,416
it was kind of fun for me.

156
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:50,219
Because for environments, the references

157
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:54,383
that I tend to look at are rocks and dirt and bricks.

158
00:07:55,304 --> 00:08:01,025
lots of bricks. So it was kind of cool to, even though I spent quite an amount of time

159
00:08:01,485 --> 00:08:05,646
looking at faces over and over again, it was a bit of a welcome change from what I usually

160
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:12,667
did. So I looked at faces such as these. These are all my coworkers, by the way. And actually,

161
00:08:12,687 --> 00:08:18,328
I have to kind of set them aside for just a small snippet. So that dapper fellow to the

162
00:08:18,368 --> 00:08:21,569
leftmost of the slide is our lead graphics engineer.

163
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:27,151
And the truth is everybody who volunteered to be scanned was super awesome.

164
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:28,432
I really appreciated it.

165
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:31,654
It's not easy to put on the stocking and sit still.

166
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:34,335
It's really awkward to have me scan them.

167
00:08:34,855 --> 00:08:39,017
But Jason went the extra mile because he usually has eyebrows.

168
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:43,543
And I asked him to shave, and I wasn't expecting him to go all out.

169
00:08:43,644 --> 00:08:47,209
So it's worth a mention, he is the most loyal game developer

170
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,772
that I've ever worked with.

171
00:08:49,673 --> 00:08:51,837
So yeah, he deserves a bit of extra recognition.

172
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:55,276
So yeah, so getting back to it,

173
00:08:55,516 --> 00:08:56,878
oops, I think I went a bit ahead.

174
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,060
So getting back to it,

175
00:08:59,621 --> 00:09:01,363
what we did with these references was

176
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:04,647
try to identify as many micro details as possible

177
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:06,970
and then afterwards simplify them

178
00:09:07,191 --> 00:09:09,654
into basic, commonly occurring shapes.

179
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:12,783
And these were our conclusions.

180
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:15,626
So first, in terms of shape,

181
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:19,090
we found that skin detail could be generalized

182
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,134
into the very technical terms of dot and line patterns,

183
00:09:23,955 --> 00:09:24,756
as you can see here.

184
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,271
And just to kind of add to that, we've found that we can combine these simple patterns

185
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:32,212
to create even more complicated patterns.

186
00:09:33,193 --> 00:09:38,195
So for instance, this kind of cross-hatching effect, although it looks quite different

187
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:42,637
from the previous shapes that I identified before, can actually be created just by combining

188
00:09:42,697 --> 00:09:44,898
lines in different orientations.

189
00:09:45,038 --> 00:09:50,560
And the one, I actually forgot to indicate this here, but this one on the right actually

190
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,961
also has a dot pattern layered on top of that too.

191
00:09:55,398 --> 00:09:56,940
The one exception was the nose.

192
00:09:57,421 --> 00:09:59,403
So we initially tried to generalize this

193
00:09:59,463 --> 00:10:02,266
just by applying a dot pattern too and modifying that a bit.

194
00:10:02,907 --> 00:10:05,249
But we found that nose pores are quite a unique shape

195
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:05,910
on their own.

196
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,513
And so that ended up becoming its own category.

197
00:10:11,115 --> 00:10:13,417
The second conclusion was regarding placement.

198
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:15,959
So we found that certain kinds of patterns

199
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:18,381
tend to be found in the same areas of the face

200
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:20,422
across many different people.

201
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:24,725
For instance, with the dot pores found more concentrated

202
00:10:24,745 --> 00:10:25,866
on the apples of the cheeks,

203
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:29,509
lines found between the cheek and the mouth,

204
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:31,130
whatever this fold is called,

205
00:10:32,171 --> 00:10:35,233
and various combinations of both throughout the face.

206
00:10:37,052 --> 00:10:39,634
So I actually went through each set of facial photos

207
00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:43,016
and categorized and color coded as many variations as I could.

208
00:10:43,596 --> 00:10:46,738
And this is a simplified version of the pore placement map

209
00:10:47,198 --> 00:10:49,840
that resulted from our observations of people's skin,

210
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,441
with the different colored areas representing

211
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:55,623
the different types of patterns that could be generalized

212
00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:56,844
across many faces.

213
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:02,684
The third characteristic was directionality.

214
00:11:03,444 --> 00:11:05,505
So we noticed that at neutral expression,

215
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:09,806
certain areas of the face were stretched by default.

216
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:13,867
And so initially we identified many more basic pore patterns

217
00:11:14,327 --> 00:11:16,767
until we realized that some of them were actually

218
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:19,868
the previous dot and line patterns I mentioned before,

219
00:11:20,328 --> 00:11:21,068
just stretched.

220
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:22,369
So for instance,

221
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:29,773
This example right here looks quite different from that basic non-directional dot pattern

222
00:11:29,793 --> 00:11:31,094
that I identified before.

223
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:35,696
And indeed, if you were to sculpt it, you would sculpt it quite differently than, let's

224
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,938
say, you would sculpt the pores on the apples of the cheeks.

225
00:11:38,518 --> 00:11:44,121
But what this is, is still basically that same dot, that dot pore pattern, but just

226
00:11:44,181 --> 00:11:46,943
stretched along these directional lines.

227
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:50,906
So we found that in general, pores on human skin

228
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:53,388
tend to follow the same directional pattern

229
00:11:53,468 --> 00:11:54,909
across many different faces.

230
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,032
So there are some variations to this as well,

231
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,113
like for instance with age,

232
00:12:00,474 --> 00:12:03,116
a lot of these directional lines tend to be stronger

233
00:12:03,996 --> 00:12:07,399
to get that, again, technical term, droopiness in the face.

234
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,463
But in general, you won't get a lot of variation from,

235
00:12:12,663 --> 00:12:16,526
or deviation from this directionality map.

236
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:26,445
So armed with these observations, we set about to design an improved skin texturing workflow with the following goals in mind.

237
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,388
So the first one was to reduce texture memory.

238
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:33,851
I mean, this was the reason that we set out to redesign our previous workflow in the first place.

239
00:12:34,552 --> 00:12:38,835
And we aim to achieve that by either reducing texture resolution per map,

240
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:43,619
sharing textures across multiple models, or if we were lucky a combination of both.

241
00:12:45,146 --> 00:12:48,108
Second, we wanted to try to reduce texture authoring time.

242
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:52,913
To be honest, this wasn't actually a main priority, but we wanted to make sure that

243
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:57,276
whatever changes we made to the workflow didn't translate to more work for the artist.

244
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:03,367
Even with these goals in mind, however, we still wanted to make sure that the quality

245
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:07,949
of the micro-details was actually better than what we were able to achieve before with our

246
00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:08,929
previous workflow.

247
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:13,231
So we decided to evaluate this by two main factors.

248
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:17,992
One, how good the details look up close compared to our previous workflow.

249
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:24,341
and two, that we were able to accurately reflect the variation in detail that skin actually has.

250
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:29,509
You know, we spent so much time looking at faces and investigating characteristics of the face,

251
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:33,375
so we really wanted to make sure to represent that as much as possible.

252
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:38,230
So with that in mind, this is how we broke down

253
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:39,730
the details for our new workflow.

254
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,051
For the primary and secondary details,

255
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:45,271
and that includes, again, large wrinkles,

256
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:49,012
pockets of fat, scars, basically large forms

257
00:13:49,032 --> 00:13:50,472
that you can easily see on the face,

258
00:13:51,053 --> 00:13:52,313
that was all still sculpted.

259
00:13:52,813 --> 00:13:54,893
That was sculpted on a custom one-to-one map.

260
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:58,354
The main difference was that we did not include

261
00:13:58,394 --> 00:14:00,215
the micro details, so no pores,

262
00:14:00,235 --> 00:14:02,075
and nothing smaller than 0.5 centimeters.

263
00:14:04,336 --> 00:14:07,217
And so because of that, we could get all these details

264
00:14:07,277 --> 00:14:11,419
down to a 512, sometimes 1K if necessary,

265
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:12,979
especially for hero characters.

266
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,541
And because we didn't have to include

267
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:18,362
all these micro details in the sculpt,

268
00:14:18,742 --> 00:14:21,083
we found that sculpting time was reduced in general

269
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,364
across the artists who tested it by about 40%.

270
00:14:24,645 --> 00:14:27,186
And in the case of scans, we could just basically

271
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,827
use the smooth scan data and bake that directly

272
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:31,608
onto the low poly and use that as is.

273
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,464
So this is an example of what a sculpt in this new workflow

274
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:38,064
looks like.

275
00:14:38,365 --> 00:14:40,967
So you can see all the major forms are represented.

276
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:43,390
There's some tiny, fine details, but that just

277
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,932
kind of came out out of sculpting habit

278
00:14:45,992 --> 00:14:46,933
from our artists.

279
00:14:47,774 --> 00:14:51,518
And when baked onto a 512, all of the details that mattered,

280
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,599
those were all preserved.

281
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,963
For the tertiary details, this is where the workflow

282
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:02,085
really differed from what we were doing before.

283
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:05,928
So for these micro details, we represented these

284
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:09,630
with four basic shapes indicating the different,

285
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:11,872
four basic, four textures indicating

286
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:12,933
the four different shapes.

287
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:17,376
So we have our dot pores, lines in different directions,

288
00:15:17,496 --> 00:15:19,177
and the nose in the alpha channel.

289
00:15:21,911 --> 00:15:24,374
And in each one, there is a cavity map

290
00:15:24,434 --> 00:15:26,698
that we stuck in the alpha channel of each texture.

291
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,722
And we use these as a mask to add detail

292
00:15:29,782 --> 00:15:31,885
to the albedo and roughness passes.

293
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:43,461
So one thing that artists could do was just by vertex painting they could control how the different details blended and

294
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:50,167
Place exactly place the details exactly where they wanted to so just by painting in different shades of gray

295
00:15:51,248 --> 00:15:58,014
And overlaying certain details they could make characters look older younger more wrinkle just by making certain details

296
00:15:58,094 --> 00:15:59,135
stronger or weaker

297
00:16:01,322 --> 00:16:04,705
And this is an example of what these different vertex channels

298
00:16:04,745 --> 00:16:05,226
look like.

299
00:16:05,826 --> 00:16:08,989
So as you can see, each detail is mapped to RGBA

300
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,673
of vertex color channels.

301
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:14,634
And these could be painted in Maya.

302
00:16:14,694 --> 00:16:16,836
Maya has a vert painting tool there.

303
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,118
Or depending on the engine that you're using,

304
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:23,442
I know Unreal 4 has a vertex painting tool in Engine.

305
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,204
So you could actually import your models

306
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,465
and paint it right there.

307
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:33,661
And to speed up vertex painting, we would start out by importing colors from a standard

308
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:34,802
pore placement map.

309
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:40,409
And we realized that we could do this because, as mentioned earlier, the same patterns tend

310
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:42,371
to be found in the same areas of the face.

311
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:44,974
So for NPCs, that was basically it.

312
00:16:45,074 --> 00:16:47,216
Like we would load it from the standard map.

313
00:16:47,797 --> 00:16:50,238
and the resulting vertex color was used as is.

314
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:52,680
But even for hero characters,

315
00:16:53,361 --> 00:16:56,162
it ended up being useful as a good jumping off point

316
00:16:56,603 --> 00:16:58,624
for artists to do the rest of the work

317
00:16:58,664 --> 00:16:59,625
that they wanted to do.

318
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:01,666
And that way they wouldn't have to start

319
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:02,907
from scratch every time.

320
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:07,839
So this on the left is what that standard map looks like.

321
00:17:07,879 --> 00:17:09,820
And this was never actually loaded in game.

322
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,942
And in Maya or in some of our in-house engines,

323
00:17:14,082 --> 00:17:17,624
also in Unreal, you could import the vertex colors

324
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:19,685
from a targ or something like that.

325
00:17:20,346 --> 00:17:22,987
And for NPCs, that would be basically it.

326
00:17:23,787 --> 00:17:25,048
But yeah, this would work.

327
00:17:25,288 --> 00:17:28,670
And this mapped pretty well with the earlier poor placement map

328
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,831
that I showed you earlier.

329
00:17:32,582 --> 00:17:35,184
So directionality was another important characteristic

330
00:17:35,224 --> 00:17:37,745
that we identified in our observations.

331
00:17:38,286 --> 00:17:40,587
And to apply that in this new workflow,

332
00:17:40,647 --> 00:17:45,250
we decided to use a smear map to control directionality.

333
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,012
So what that is is basically 2D vector offsets

334
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:50,773
and works similar to a flow map.

335
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,254
And you would author that similarly

336
00:17:52,314 --> 00:17:54,155
to how you would author a flow map as well.

337
00:17:54,755 --> 00:17:57,057
And these would have a direct influence on the UVs

338
00:17:57,517 --> 00:17:59,198
to mimic that look of stretching

339
00:17:59,238 --> 00:18:00,499
that I was talking about earlier.

340
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,645
And this map can be shared or custom.

341
00:18:04,186 --> 00:18:05,587
So depending on the character.

342
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:10,770
For NPCs, we used a few standard smear maps.

343
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,851
And I say a few because we had a couple,

344
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:15,273
for instance, one for older characters

345
00:18:15,313 --> 00:18:16,774
and one for younger characters.

346
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,837
But since in certain areas and for certain individuals,

347
00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:25,219
directionality and stretching can vary significantly

348
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,360
between different models.

349
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,902
We also wanted artists to have the option to create their own

350
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:34,083
custom smear map for each character. So this,

351
00:18:34,723 --> 00:18:41,465
depending on if it was a hero character or an NPC, it could either be shared or a custom map.

352
00:18:42,867 --> 00:18:45,707
So I have a video for you guys, but I won't load it directly from here.

353
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:49,208
At Square Enix, different teams use different engines,

354
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:51,469
and we have this set up in in-house engines,

355
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:54,769
but for this talk, we chose to do all of our examples in Unreal,

356
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,850
Unreal 4, for a couple of reasons.

357
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,671
So one, everyone has access to Unreal.

358
00:18:59,691 --> 00:19:02,771
You guys are probably familiar with it or can be familiar with it.

359
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:05,652
And the whole point of sharing this workflow at this point

360
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:08,333
is that you guys can all do it and try it yourselves.

361
00:19:09,394 --> 00:19:12,399
But also we have a few teams that are using Unreal

362
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:15,244
to develop their games, so it made sense.

363
00:19:16,366 --> 00:19:17,568
Yeah, so that's been a lot of words,

364
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:20,814
but it'll probably be easier to demonstrate in a video.

365
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:21,896
Okay.

366
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:28,117
All right, so in this one, I'm just applying

367
00:19:28,738 --> 00:19:32,621
the different details with RGBA channels

368
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:33,862
and vertex painting that.

369
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:38,366
And we have the ability to adjust the intensity

370
00:19:38,406 --> 00:19:41,549
and scale globally for each detail through sliders.

371
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,703
And in this example, we actually have the dot pores

372
00:19:45,743 --> 00:19:46,544
layered twice.

373
00:19:46,804 --> 00:19:48,546
So this was actually kind of interesting

374
00:19:48,586 --> 00:19:50,047
to see how our artists used it.

375
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:52,610
So some people used it just to kind of add

376
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,592
some general bumpiness to the skin.

377
00:19:54,632 --> 00:19:56,954
So they scaled it really big, and you'd

378
00:19:56,994 --> 00:19:59,817
have this kind of just general unevenness.

379
00:20:00,377 --> 00:20:03,480
And other people used it to scale it really small

380
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:07,565
and had like really, really fine micro pores on there.

381
00:20:09,934 --> 00:20:15,682
So as I was saying before, depending on how you paint these details, you can paint in

382
00:20:15,722 --> 00:20:21,890
different shades of grey and the artist has full flexibility on where and how intense

383
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,911
certain details are.

384
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:26,617
Editing each detail is also a lot easier.

385
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:29,759
So compared to the old workflow of separating these details

386
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:33,920
in ZBrush layers, editing them was quite difficult.

387
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,061
But here you can kind of experiment with scale.

388
00:20:36,441 --> 00:20:38,182
You can erase at will, but preserve.

389
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:39,402
For instance, you can,

390
00:20:39,902 --> 00:20:41,163
I'm just gonna pause it for a second.

391
00:20:42,423 --> 00:20:46,945
You can choose to edit only lines, only wrinkles,

392
00:20:47,025 --> 00:20:48,266
but leave the pores intact.

393
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:51,549
And this last bit, if you just pay attention

394
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:53,551
to where the arrows are pointing to,

395
00:20:54,392 --> 00:20:57,635
you'll see the effect of the curvature of these wrinkles

396
00:20:58,016 --> 00:20:59,798
by toggling the smear map on and off.

397
00:21:00,358 --> 00:21:02,520
So I hope it's big enough on there.

398
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:08,407
You can just see the curvature changing a bit.

399
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:09,027
Okay.

400
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:10,669
All right.

401
00:21:15,257 --> 00:21:20,478
So this is how I break down how the textures are,

402
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:24,519
so how the details are summarized in the different textures.

403
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,260
So as I mentioned before,

404
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,901
the primary and secondary details are still sculpted,

405
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:32,041
but on a much smaller map.

406
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:34,182
And again, like the previous workflow,

407
00:21:34,202 --> 00:21:36,302
this is still custom to each character.

408
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:44,247
And the tertiary details this time are handled by either four 128 by 128 detail maps

409
00:21:44,687 --> 00:21:49,731
or they're atlased together into a slightly larger 256 by 256 texture atlas.

410
00:21:50,191 --> 00:21:52,533
And these are shared across all human characters.

411
00:21:53,824 --> 00:21:58,288
Then for the smear map, that's on average about 256 by 256,

412
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:00,710
and this handled the directionality

413
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:02,392
or the static stretching of the skin.

414
00:22:02,952 --> 00:22:04,934
And this was shared or not shared

415
00:22:04,974 --> 00:22:07,997
depending on the importance of the character

416
00:22:08,397 --> 00:22:11,660
and also the, I guess, the choice of the artist.

417
00:22:14,255 --> 00:22:16,397
And since I'm assuming we're all visual people,

418
00:22:16,417 --> 00:22:19,120
or at least maybe it's easier to understand this

419
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,222
by, you know, through visual means,

420
00:22:22,082 --> 00:22:23,704
these are the relative texture sizes

421
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,706
comparing the old workflow and the new workflow.

422
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,668
So the textures that are outlined in yellow,

423
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:31,110
those, again, are custom to each character.

424
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:32,692
The ones in green are shared.

425
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:37,675
and still comparing the lowest resolution scenario

426
00:22:37,755 --> 00:22:40,818
of our old workflow with the highest resolution scenario

427
00:22:40,838 --> 00:22:43,299
of our new workflow, there's still a considerable

428
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:45,741
improvement in terms of texture memory.

429
00:22:47,462 --> 00:22:49,163
And this is what that looks like applied

430
00:22:49,183 --> 00:22:50,344
to an actual model.

431
00:22:50,384 --> 00:22:53,646
So this is, again, using the old workflow

432
00:22:55,428 --> 00:22:56,268
compared to the new.

433
00:22:59,132 --> 00:23:02,694
And in terms of close-ups, so this is a 4K normal map

434
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:07,036
that's applied on here, compared to the largest normal map

435
00:23:07,056 --> 00:23:08,296
that's applied to this is a 512.

436
00:23:11,618 --> 00:23:14,259
And I mean, you'd never go, you'd probably never go

437
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:16,820
this close ever to a character's skin,

438
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,541
but now you can if you want to, so I don't know,

439
00:23:19,581 --> 00:23:22,943
you could come up with some creative shots

440
00:23:23,223 --> 00:23:24,083
using this technique.

441
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:32,695
So we created some different lighting scenarios just to test how the pores react,

442
00:23:33,535 --> 00:23:37,336
if they were acting the way that we expected them to under different lighting scenarios.

443
00:23:37,356 --> 00:23:39,957
So I'm just going to scroll through them so you can see.

444
00:23:40,697 --> 00:23:42,218
We got kind of creative with this.

445
00:23:42,258 --> 00:23:43,938
We don't really get to do fun lighting, so...

446
00:23:50,751 --> 00:23:51,692
This one's my favorite one.

447
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:53,434
It's kind of a Sin City sort of thing.

448
00:23:53,494 --> 00:23:55,657
It's quite different from Final Fantasy,

449
00:23:55,697 --> 00:23:58,020
so it was kind of interesting for us.

450
00:24:04,707 --> 00:24:07,748
Yeah, so we're always looking to improve

451
00:24:08,288 --> 00:24:10,449
what we're working on, and there's some things

452
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:13,730
that we are planning for our next steps,

453
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:15,830
like to try to improve this workflow even further.

454
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:19,592
One of them is to try and use procedural substances

455
00:24:19,752 --> 00:24:20,652
in lieu of bitmaps.

456
00:24:21,172 --> 00:24:23,214
So at the moment, the textures that we're using

457
00:24:23,574 --> 00:24:27,017
are sourced from scans mixed with a bit of hand sculpting.

458
00:24:27,557 --> 00:24:30,880
But with substances, we think that we can reduce

459
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,222
texture memory even further and also add

460
00:24:33,242 --> 00:24:35,504
some more customizability at the pattern level.

461
00:24:37,085 --> 00:24:39,207
Another thing that we're doing is looking at pore distortion

462
00:24:39,247 --> 00:24:40,388
for facial animation.

463
00:24:40,508 --> 00:24:43,611
So making sure that in addition to static stretching,

464
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:47,434
the animated stretching also matched with facial animation.

465
00:24:47,915 --> 00:24:50,397
So that's my colleague Chida Kazuhisa,

466
00:24:50,497 --> 00:24:51,938
he's working on that.

467
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:54,160
And it's a separate system, but we're making sure

468
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,242
that our different workflows complement each other.

469
00:24:57,943 --> 00:25:04,009
Another thing that's really important that we want to try to push even further is increasing ways for customization.

470
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:09,374
So one way is to add two layers of RGBA instead of just one.

471
00:25:09,914 --> 00:25:15,019
So currently we have four basic patterns for each channel RGBA,

472
00:25:15,479 --> 00:25:20,043
but with two we're thinking, with that extra set of details we could either have...

473
00:25:20,664 --> 00:25:26,069
entirely new different set of details or have the same ones but have the ability

474
00:25:26,189 --> 00:25:30,453
to have different scales and different intensities at different parts of the

475
00:25:30,473 --> 00:25:37,400
face. And lastly one of the things we're looking into is allowing for optional

476
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,004
masks to allow for decal application. So for instance in the case of war paint.

477
00:25:43,493 --> 00:25:45,555
Yeah, okay.

478
00:25:45,575 --> 00:25:48,279
And I don't know if there's a moral to GDC talks,

479
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:50,441
but if there is, the moral to this story

480
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:54,026
is that interdepartmental collaboration is good.

481
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:57,250
So nowadays, skill sets are so.

482
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:03,055
specific and so defined and so specialized that we don't really get to talk to each other

483
00:26:03,115 --> 00:26:03,375
much.

484
00:26:03,856 --> 00:26:08,200
So, for instance, in terms of character artists and environment artists, we have completely

485
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,061
different workflows.

486
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:12,364
We use the same software but in completely different ways.

487
00:26:13,044 --> 00:26:15,887
And we don't really get this chance to work together in production.

488
00:26:16,728 --> 00:26:20,010
And that's a real shame because, for instance, in this case,

489
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,573
the solution to one of the problems that one of our departments was having

490
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:26,235
was already put in practice for a while.

491
00:26:26,915 --> 00:26:30,098
And the point is, inspiration can come from unlikely places

492
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:33,421
and no harm can ever come from just talking to each other more.

493
00:26:34,902 --> 00:26:35,342
So, yay!

494
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:39,045
Before finishing, I'd just like to give some special thanks

495
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:40,906
to a bunch of people who helped.

496
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:44,269
significantly in developing this workflow.

497
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,910
So first to Eduardo Mozena,

498
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,551
who is the chief character artist

499
00:26:48,751 --> 00:26:51,233
and did all the art for this presentation

500
00:26:51,353 --> 00:26:53,314
and also co-developed this workflow with me.

501
00:26:54,995 --> 00:26:57,677
Also to Jason Lacroix and Chida Kazuhisa,

502
00:26:57,797 --> 00:27:00,299
who in addition to being fabulous models,

503
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:01,520
their faces are in the slides,

504
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,221
they're also really helpful

505
00:27:04,241 --> 00:27:05,802
in providing feedback and advice.

506
00:27:06,863 --> 00:27:12,624
Ishii Haruya as well tested this workflow extensively and gave a lot of useful feedback.

507
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:17,826
And the other names on here, Graham Murray, Hendrik Skubach, and Paul Chandler are just

508
00:27:17,866 --> 00:27:22,647
some of the other models that I have in my slides and were kind enough to let me use

509
00:27:22,667 --> 00:27:23,287
their images.

510
00:27:25,468 --> 00:27:28,389
So yeah, I think we have time for questions, right?

511
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:29,729
So if you've got any questions...

512
00:27:40,207 --> 00:27:47,251
Hi, great work. I had a quick question about the smear map. Did you have any problem with singularities due to the directionality of it?

513
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:48,792
Sorry, pardon me?

514
00:27:49,337 --> 00:27:57,081
With the smear map you said it was some 2d vectors on there. Do you have any problem with singularities occurring due to just

515
00:27:57,421 --> 00:28:03,285
Not in our experience. I mean like to be fair. We we only had a few artists test this

516
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:11,069
This workflow and they would author smear maps like let's say in Mari some of one of them like kind of hacked the

517
00:28:11,629 --> 00:28:13,110
vertex paint

518
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,231
functionality in Maya to try to create

519
00:28:15,752 --> 00:28:17,253
a smear map that way, I don't recommend it.

520
00:28:17,673 --> 00:28:20,696
But no problems that way had ever really come up.

521
00:28:20,816 --> 00:28:24,620
So yeah, I hope that answers your question.

522
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,060
Thanks.

523
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:30,365
Any other questions?

524
00:28:33,808 --> 00:28:34,268
Hi, nice.

525
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:34,809
Great talk.

526
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,612
I kind of missed on, when you were painting on the face,

527
00:28:39,113 --> 00:28:40,594
which application were you using?

528
00:28:40,614 --> 00:28:42,476
It's in-house, or it's a ZBrush, or?

529
00:28:43,241 --> 00:28:50,127
Oh, that's actually in Unreal 4, using the vertex paint tool in Unreal.

530
00:28:51,348 --> 00:28:54,950
So, I mean, I'm not saying that you need to use that.

531
00:28:55,251 --> 00:28:58,914
Oh, sorry, I guess the question was, like, what was the tool that I was using in that video?

532
00:29:00,735 --> 00:29:02,195
It depends on your own workflow.

533
00:29:02,235 --> 00:29:03,716
It depends on your in-house engine.

534
00:29:03,756 --> 00:29:07,918
Like, not all engines have that in-engine vertex paint capability.

535
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,761
So in that case, you could use Maya, because Maya has that ability.

536
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:17,203
But I thought it would just be easier to demonstrate in Unreal, in this case.

537
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,163
Hi. I think this is really cool.

538
00:29:23,343 --> 00:29:26,787
And I have a question about the production on this.

539
00:29:28,108 --> 00:29:33,152
If this is in use on older men or men's skin, I think that would be perfect.

540
00:29:33,513 --> 00:29:37,736
But how do you treat this on some teenager or young girl's face?

541
00:29:38,097 --> 00:29:39,718
Would you still like to use the same way?

542
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:44,643
Because, you know, the young ladies maybe show the beauty of their skin.

543
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,084
And how do you balance it?

544
00:29:46,884 --> 00:29:50,506
So the question was, I guess he understands

545
00:29:50,566 --> 00:29:52,607
how this workflow applies to men,

546
00:29:53,127 --> 00:29:56,348
but how would it work for prettier people, I guess.

547
00:29:57,349 --> 00:30:00,170
And the truth is, you can use it for women,

548
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:02,691
smoother skin and younger skin as well.

549
00:30:03,352 --> 00:30:05,753
Because even young skin also has pores.

550
00:30:05,813 --> 00:30:08,654
They're just a lot finer and less pronounced.

551
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:12,396
So in this example, we use an older character

552
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:14,717
with more pronounced details,

553
00:30:14,757 --> 00:30:16,018
just so you could see it better.

554
00:30:16,638 --> 00:30:18,682
but it would still be the same workflow,

555
00:30:18,702 --> 00:30:21,046
just applied a lot more lightly,

556
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:23,811
either the way that you painted

557
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:25,333
or through the global parameters,

558
00:30:25,373 --> 00:30:26,756
just kind of scaling that all down.

559
00:30:27,537 --> 00:30:28,098
Okay, thank you.

560
00:30:31,712 --> 00:30:36,495
Hi, this goes a little bit beyond the scope of the panel discussion, but I was wondering

561
00:30:36,515 --> 00:30:42,319
if you could provide any additional insights onto achieving more accurate subsurface scattering

562
00:30:42,379 --> 00:30:42,680
maps.

563
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:48,484
I traditionally see them, they're more hand-painted and kind of artistic decisions, but I'd love

564
00:30:48,504 --> 00:30:53,788
to know if you've explored anything with facial tissue depths or achieving greater accuracy

565
00:30:53,888 --> 00:30:56,470
with actual real-life subsurface scattering on skin.

566
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,551
So the question was about subsurface scattering,

567
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,212
which again for this presentation,

568
00:31:01,312 --> 00:31:04,614
we kind of focused more on just texturing and normal details.

569
00:31:04,734 --> 00:31:07,376
If you want, you can email me that question.

570
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:08,857
I could try to forward it to somebody

571
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:11,219
who might be looking at that right now.

572
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:11,979
Oh, certainly.

573
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:13,140
I sincerely appreciate that.

574
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:13,700
Okay, thanks.

575
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,541
Thank you so much.

576
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:16,902
Anybody else?

577
00:31:17,182 --> 00:31:18,003
Yeah, we're good?

578
00:31:18,663 --> 00:31:20,004
Okay, all right, thanks.

579
00:31:20,304 --> 00:31:21,305
Oh, one more question?

580
00:31:23,072 --> 00:31:27,095
Could you use a RGB mask instead of using a vertex color

581
00:31:27,515 --> 00:31:28,996
for your placement of?

582
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,197
Yes, actually.

583
00:31:30,217 --> 00:31:33,079
So the question was if we can use an RGBA mask instead

584
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:33,899
of vertex color.

585
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,461
You absolutely could.

586
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:37,822
The point with using vertex color

587
00:31:38,203 --> 00:31:39,784
was to reduce texture memory.

588
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,606
So that's one of the things that we're trying to do now,

589
00:31:42,646 --> 00:31:46,769
like how to layer to RGBA instead of just adding

590
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:48,830
more and more maps.

591
00:31:49,751 --> 00:31:51,172
Because the point is to try to reduce this.

592
00:31:52,353 --> 00:31:54,198
Yeah, reduce text from memory as much as possible.

593
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:55,261
But you totally could.

594
00:31:55,282 --> 00:31:55,322
OK.

595
00:31:55,342 --> 00:31:56,645
Thank you.
