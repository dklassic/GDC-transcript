1
00:00:06,168 --> 00:00:10,354
Thanks for coming, appreciate it.

2
00:00:10,354 --> 00:00:15,001
I'm going to tell you a little story.

3
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:16,023
I think we're starting, right?

4
00:00:16,023 --> 00:00:17,325
Okay, good.

5
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:19,468
A little while ago, I was...

6
00:00:20,784 --> 00:00:28,009
Googling myself up on the internets, and this thing kept popping up over and over again.

7
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:32,053
Sid Meier says, games are a series of interesting decisions.

8
00:00:32,053 --> 00:00:39,639
And some people felt that was the most brilliant statement ever made in terms of games,

9
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:43,482
and some people felt, Sid Meier, what an idiot.

10
00:00:43,482 --> 00:00:47,505
That's totally wrong. That's nothing.

11
00:00:48,138 --> 00:00:57,423
And I realized this was based on something I believe I said at a GDC presentation way back in

12
00:00:57,423 --> 00:01:03,346
the early, the misty days, early days of computer games. And I had never really thought too much

13
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:09,149
about it, but it had kind of caught on with people writing books about games and trying to find

14
00:01:09,149 --> 00:01:10,070
fun and things like that.

15
00:01:11,152 --> 00:01:28,056
And I thought it might be interesting to kind of dig a little deeper into that idea and talk about interesting decisions and how I think it's a useful way of looking at games and maybe some ways that might be useful for other game designers.

16
00:01:28,056 --> 00:01:39,859
And I'm going to try not to talk about any specific genre of game or type of game, but talk more about decisions in general and how perhaps we can make them more interesting, how we can recognize them and things like that.

17
00:01:40,762 --> 00:01:47,423
Up until, up until today, really the only way that I've kind of talked about this idea

18
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:51,305
is by breaking down the statement to series.

19
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:55,226
And I think that, that speaks to the idea of pacing.

20
00:01:55,226 --> 00:01:57,006
The games have a pace to them.

21
00:01:57,006 --> 00:02:01,327
I think we all recognize, if we look at it, that certain games are very fast paced, certain

22
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:02,768
games are slower paced.

23
00:02:02,768 --> 00:02:07,589
And that has an impact on the quality of the decisions and the nature of the decisions.

24
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:11,496
And the other part is the idea of interesting decisions.

25
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:14,157
And what makes a decision interesting?

26
00:02:14,157 --> 00:02:21,220
It's kind of almost easier to look at it at what is not an interesting decision.

27
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:27,764
For example, if in a game you're presented with choice A, B, and C, and the player always

28
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:32,086
chooses A, you probably haven't created an interesting decision for the player, and the

29
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:34,347
computer should just choose A automatically and move on.

30
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:40,132
Uh, again, if you present the player with a choice of A, B, and C, and the player kind

31
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:44,654
of randomly just chooses one of those and moves on, again, you probably haven't provided

32
00:02:44,654 --> 00:02:46,335
the player with an interesting decision.

33
00:02:46,335 --> 00:02:52,879
So, uh, let's just kind of a very, uh, uh, first level look at that idea, but what we

34
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,862
want to do today, I think, is dig a little deeper into the idea and try and, and, and

35
00:02:57,862 --> 00:03:03,866
talk about how we can make our decisions more interesting and, uh, make our games more fun.

36
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:10,033
Now, I've gotten some pushback on this idea.

37
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:13,655
People who disagree with the idea that games are a series of

38
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:14,435
interesting decisions.

39
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:17,636
And I'm really not going to argue about that today.

40
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:21,017
I don't claim this is the only way of looking at games or

41
00:03:21,017 --> 00:03:22,998
applies to every single game.

42
00:03:22,998 --> 00:03:26,099
I think if you have a rhythm game like Guitar Hero.

43
00:03:27,352 --> 00:03:33,095
I could make a case that there are fascinating decisions in there, but it's more, it's not

44
00:03:33,095 --> 00:03:36,737
a game where interesting decisions are front and center.

45
00:03:36,737 --> 00:03:39,458
Also with a puzzle game, for example.

46
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:43,821
So there may be some types of games for which the idea of interesting decisions is not a

47
00:03:43,821 --> 00:03:48,803
super useful way of looking at them, but I think for the majority of games it is useful

48
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:53,466
to look at them in terms of the decisions that the player is presented with and how

49
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,086
interesting they are.

50
00:03:55,670 --> 00:04:00,673
So how do we use this idea of interesting decisions?

51
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:04,596
This is a picture of my son and I playing a computer game.

52
00:04:04,596 --> 00:04:09,499
To give you a sense of time, he's now a college graduate.

53
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:15,769
So, this was a little while ago, but it kind of encapsulates for me what we're trying to

54
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:16,449
do here.

55
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:22,611
Why it is important that we make our games fun, that we find the fun, that we search

56
00:04:22,611 --> 00:04:27,472
for the fun and make them as fun to play as possible to kind of generate these moments

57
00:04:27,472 --> 00:04:28,772
for the player.

58
00:04:28,772 --> 00:04:33,493
And I think that thinking about interesting decisions is one way of finding the fun.

59
00:04:34,861 --> 00:04:37,061
So when is this idea useful?

60
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:43,023
I think it's a useful concept during the design phase.

61
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:45,943
One of the things that I see often

62
00:04:45,943 --> 00:04:49,604
is designs are kind of about putting together

63
00:04:49,604 --> 00:04:50,764
pieces of other games.

64
00:04:50,764 --> 00:04:53,265
What if we took a little bit of a shooter

65
00:04:53,265 --> 00:04:57,866
and added some StarCraft to it, and then we put in maybe

66
00:04:57,866 --> 00:05:00,006
some racing or whatever?

67
00:05:00,006 --> 00:05:00,746
Kind of.

68
00:05:02,164 --> 00:05:07,188
Lego game design, you know, the idea that, well, these other games are fun, so if I take

69
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:11,171
pieces of these games, my game is itself going to be fun.

70
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:17,337
Unfortunately, that doesn't often, that doesn't always work out, and I think it's a more useful

71
00:05:17,337 --> 00:05:21,440
way to look at a new game design in terms of what are the decisions that I'm presenting

72
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,161
the player with.

73
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:24,423
Are they, are they interesting?

74
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:26,064
Put yourself in the player's point of view.

75
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:32,075
in the player's chair and imagining what decisions can I create based on this scenario, this

76
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:38,099
design, this world that I want to create. So I think it's a useful concept to apply

77
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:42,463
even in the early design stages is to kind of imagine what are the actual decisions that

78
00:05:42,463 --> 00:05:48,127
the player is being asked to make during the course of the game. And I think this can help

79
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:53,411
you to kind of crystallize what are the cool parts of this design idea that you have and

80
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:54,692
what to kind of focus your early

81
00:05:55,243 --> 00:05:58,344
prototyping on, and I'm sure we all believe in, rapid

82
00:05:58,344 --> 00:06:00,464
prototyping. That's a whole other talk. Uh, the idea of

83
00:06:00,464 --> 00:06:07,966
focusing on interesting decisions, uh, can be useful

84
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:10,747
during the development phase. As you're making a game, how

85
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:13,407
do I make this game more fun? One of the key

86
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:14,708
ways to do that is to look at the

87
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,928
decisions that the player is making during the game and

88
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:20,209
try to make them more interesting. Now, we'll talk

89
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:22,110
more about what interesting means a little later, but,

90
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,870
uh, again, during the development of the game.

91
00:06:25,688 --> 00:06:31,391
It's very useful to look at your decisions and see how the players respond to them and

92
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,772
how interesting they are.

93
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:37,715
It's also a useful concept as you're debugging the game.

94
00:06:37,715 --> 00:06:39,496
Where's the fun?

95
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:43,018
I think we've all been near the end of the project.

96
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:45,800
Every project of ours has what we call the valley of doom.

97
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,183
About halfway to two-thirds of the way through, you're kind of convinced, why did we ever

98
00:06:51,183 --> 00:06:51,963
make this game?

99
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:52,844
This is never going to work.

100
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:55,785
This is not fun enough.

101
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:59,288
I think focusing again on your decisions and trying to make

102
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:02,310
them as interesting, as fun as possible, is something that's

103
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,672
worth doing even during the later stages of the game.

104
00:07:04,672 --> 00:07:09,035
If you're trying to find and refine those last few ounces

105
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:12,458
of fun, I think some of the ideas that we're going to talk

106
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,641
about can be very useful for doing that.

107
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:20,064
So what are some of the characteristics of

108
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,165
interesting decisions?

109
00:07:23,408 --> 00:07:25,629
I think a very common one is they involve

110
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:30,230
some sort of a tradeoff. That you can buy

111
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,450
a big sword, but it costs you five hundred

112
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:37,812
gold. I can use, I'm playing a racing game,

113
00:07:37,812 --> 00:07:40,692
I can choose this car, which is very fast,

114
00:07:40,692 --> 00:07:42,593
but doesn't have great handling, or I can choose

115
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:45,133
this other car, has great handling, but it's not

116
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:48,774
quite as, as fast. In a civilization game, I

117
00:07:48,774 --> 00:07:52,415
can build a defensive unit.

118
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,832
and defend my city, but then I'm not generating more gold,

119
00:07:57,832 --> 00:08:00,933
or I can build a building that'll

120
00:08:00,933 --> 00:08:02,093
help my civilization advance.

121
00:08:02,093 --> 00:08:05,714
Or again, there's all these most interesting decisions,

122
00:08:05,714 --> 00:08:08,255
I'd almost say all of them, involve

123
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,455
some sort of a trade-off.

124
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,196
And it's just important to recognize

125
00:08:11,196 --> 00:08:14,077
what that trade-off is when you look at your decisions.

126
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:20,378
And good decisions, I think, are situational.

127
00:08:20,378 --> 00:08:22,759
I think this is a very key idea that.

128
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:33,252
When the decision is presented to the player, ideally it interacts in some very interesting way with the game situation.

129
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:38,276
For example, we talked about the car, the fast car versus the car with good handling.

130
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:43,179
Well, that is going to interact with what the next race is.

131
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,360
What does that track look like?

132
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,602
What are your particular skills as a driver?

133
00:08:46,602 --> 00:08:50,665
What are you trying to accomplish in this race?

134
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:51,646
If you're playing a shooter.

135
00:08:52,173 --> 00:08:58,336
A trade-off might be between sneaking around and hiding behind cover or rushing forward.

136
00:08:58,336 --> 00:09:04,979
In Civ, I think there are many, many decisions that are really situational.

137
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:10,421
I haven't explored much of the map yet, so I want a fast unit, I want a scout unit to run around and see what's out there.

138
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:19,323
I'm just about to be attacked by Angus Khan and his horde of Mongols, so I need defensive units.

139
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:22,845
I just discovered a new territory. I want to plant a city over there. I need to build some settlers.

140
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:29,068
So it's one decision that the player is faced with. What do I build next?

141
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:33,370
But it ties very directly into the game situation.

142
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,512
And that's how you really add interest and variety to a lot of decisions,

143
00:09:36,512 --> 00:09:39,753
is by making them very situational, very dependent on.

144
00:09:40,282 --> 00:09:41,982
the current game situation.

145
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:48,044
Some decisions can be personal.

146
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:54,327
In other words, tied to your gaming style.

147
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,508
Perhaps you are cautious.

148
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:59,117
Turtle, enjoy the turtle strategy.

149
00:09:59,117 --> 00:10:02,718
And so you would build defensive units.

150
00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:08,139
You would build a very secure base from which you can then expand.

151
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:09,060
Perhaps you're aggressive.

152
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,980
You would build a whole different set of units.

153
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,260
You'd have a whole different strategy.

154
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:15,461
And again, the decision, this interesting decision,

155
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:18,542
would allow you to express your personal play style.

156
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:23,274
Decisions have persistence.

157
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:25,376
They, interesting decisions, have persistence.

158
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:28,739
They affect the game for a certain amount of time.

159
00:10:28,739 --> 00:10:30,241
Maybe it's a long period of time,

160
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:31,162
maybe it's a short period of time.

161
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:32,403
But you really want to be aware

162
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:35,125
of what the persistence of a decision is.

163
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,706
If it's a long-term decision.

164
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:42,361
you really need to give the player enough information to feel comfortable making that decision.

165
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:46,423
There's nothing worse than playing a game, doing something very early on,

166
00:10:46,423 --> 00:10:52,466
that you didn't quite understand, that totally messes up your play experience for the rest of the game.

167
00:10:52,466 --> 00:10:56,168
So it's important to understand what the persistence of your decisions are,

168
00:10:56,168 --> 00:10:57,969
and present them in a way appropriate to that.

169
00:10:57,969 --> 00:11:02,631
If a decision has a short persistence, it only affects the game for the next minute or two,

170
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:04,652
you can be a little more...

171
00:11:06,428 --> 00:11:11,333
take more chances, maybe provide a lot of interesting options where the player realizes

172
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:15,738
I'm just kind of going to try this out, it's not going to mess up my game forever, but

173
00:11:15,738 --> 00:11:17,719
I might try this new strategy or something different.

174
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:26,628
So consider the persistence of the decisions when presenting them to the player.

175
00:11:26,628 --> 00:11:29,931
Here are some types of decisions.

176
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,691
You might be looking at your game and saying,

177
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,032
I need more decisions.

178
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:35,554
I need to put some more stuff in there.

179
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:37,676
It just doesn't feel like there's enough going on.

180
00:11:37,676 --> 00:11:39,797
I'm not giving the player enough stuff to do.

181
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:42,540
So here's some of the types of decisions you might look at,

182
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,884
see if there are opportunities to include these in your game.

183
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:53,509
One of the classic decision types is risk versus reward.

184
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:59,326
In a game like Civilization, it would be, do I defend my first city with a couple of

185
00:11:59,326 --> 00:12:07,010
phalanxes and then be kind of cautiously explore, or am I going to just kind of build a couple

186
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:12,132
of scouts and just check everything out and hopefully the barbarians won't show up, but

187
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:19,416
if they do, darn, might be choosing the fast car in a racing game.

188
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:23,098
You know, I'm going to go as fast as I can and just hope I can make it around those curves,

189
00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:23,278
you know.

190
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:29,527
So, often there are decisions that involve this idea of risk versus reward.

191
00:12:29,527 --> 00:12:33,330
I can take a greater risk with the potential of a greater reward,

192
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,352
but if it doesn't work out, then the penalties are larger.

193
00:12:36,352 --> 00:12:39,374
So, this is one type of decision you might want to look at in your game.

194
00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:44,578
Is there an opportunity for finding some risk versus reward decisions?

195
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:50,042
I think in almost any kind of game, you'll find these kind of opportunities for these decisions.

196
00:12:52,832 --> 00:13:00,118
Short-term versus long-term is another category of decision that you probably can find in

197
00:13:00,118 --> 00:13:01,058
your game design.

198
00:13:01,058 --> 00:13:06,363
In Civilization, again, building a wonder, which is something that's going to take a

199
00:13:06,363 --> 00:13:11,107
long time, but in the long-term it's going to do something wonderful for your Civilization.

200
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:15,190
Versus building a chariot, which is going to be cool right away, it's going to be a

201
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:19,874
lot of fun, but it might not have the same long-term impact on your game.

202
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:25,865
in a racing game, perhaps buying that new car.

203
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:30,626
It's going to take you a while to tune it up to maximum capacity,

204
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:34,047
but in the long term it's going to be a good investment for your racing career.

205
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:38,188
Short term decision might be to add some new tires or a bigger engine to your current car,

206
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:43,010
which is going to help you in the short term, but a longer term,

207
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,251
you still have to drive that same car.

208
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:51,788
So look for opportunities to include short versus long term

209
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:53,608
decisions in your game.

210
00:13:53,608 --> 00:14:00,271
Again, the idea of accommodating the player's play style.

211
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:03,352
What we found in development is you really

212
00:14:03,352 --> 00:14:05,232
can't do enough of this.

213
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:08,193
It's very tempting as a designer to imagine

214
00:14:08,193 --> 00:14:10,794
that everybody plays the game the same way that you do.

215
00:14:10,794 --> 00:14:13,475
And it's very tempting as a design and development group.

216
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:17,488
to kind of feel that you represent all players.

217
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:20,371
But there's an incredible range of players out there,

218
00:14:20,371 --> 00:14:22,733
and it's actually, it's increasing

219
00:14:22,733 --> 00:14:26,016
as games become more and more popular

220
00:14:26,016 --> 00:14:28,178
and more and more widespread.

221
00:14:28,178 --> 00:14:32,061
So try and include as many varieties of play style

222
00:14:32,061 --> 00:14:34,423
as you can in the decisions that you provide the players.

223
00:14:37,103 --> 00:14:41,664
We're now up to, I think, seven difficulty levels in Civilization

224
00:14:41,664 --> 00:14:44,685
to accommodate an incredibly wide range of players.

225
00:14:44,685 --> 00:14:51,326
The, again, defensive versus offensive, aggressive versus cautious,

226
00:14:51,326 --> 00:14:57,387
all these different play styles are things that you want to provide opportunities

227
00:14:57,387 --> 00:14:59,668
for the player to express as they play your game.

228
00:14:59,668 --> 00:15:06,869
Think about at what level your decisions are.

229
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:06,889
I...

230
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:12,546
I'm sorry that I keep coming back to Civilization, but it's a game that I'm somewhat familiar with.

231
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:19,169
I think one of the strengths of Civilization is that it has things happening at various levels.

232
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:22,031
There are things happening that are short-term.

233
00:15:22,031 --> 00:15:24,872
You're attacking a city that's close to you.

234
00:15:24,872 --> 00:15:27,393
You're defending this other city against the barbarians.

235
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,855
You're exploring the coastline to see what's happening out there.

236
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:33,820
You have some medium term things going on.

237
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,641
You've decided that you're going to go for a military strategy.

238
00:15:38,641 --> 00:15:42,262
So your decisions are in the medium term,

239
00:15:42,262 --> 00:15:46,704
are geared to conquering, exploring,

240
00:15:46,704 --> 00:15:49,845
expanding your territory.

241
00:15:49,845 --> 00:15:54,086
Your long term strategy, your long term goal is to win the game.

242
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:57,647
So your medium term strategy might not work out.

243
00:15:57,647 --> 00:16:00,868
You might need to change your strategy halfway through the game or whatever.

244
00:16:02,155 --> 00:16:06,877
Long term, you have the idea of winning the game.

245
00:16:06,877 --> 00:16:08,478
You might be going for a high score.

246
00:16:08,478 --> 00:16:14,282
You might be, have a goal that extends even outside

247
00:16:14,282 --> 00:16:16,623
of this particular game that you're playing.

248
00:16:16,623 --> 00:16:18,825
In a lot of game styles, types,

249
00:16:18,825 --> 00:16:21,026
you really need to include metagaming

250
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:24,048
in your long term decision making.

251
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:27,410
In other words, am I trying to get high ranking?

252
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,351
Am I playing a multiplayer game where

253
00:16:30,098 --> 00:16:36,319
my clan is really counting on me or there are things that are happening even outside of one play game

254
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:42,140
that are goals that the player has. And a game that has decisions at these various levels I think has

255
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:51,762
it's kind of one of the keys to the one more turn quality of a game like Civilization or any game

256
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:57,003
that is really draws a player in is going to have things happening at various levels so there's

257
00:16:57,003 --> 00:16:58,223
never a point where

258
00:16:58,668 --> 00:17:01,028
you're kind of all done with everything that you're trying to do.

259
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:03,829
You might achieve one of your short-term goals,

260
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:06,710
but you're in the middle of one of your medium-term goals,

261
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,811
and your long-term goal is still out there,

262
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:11,111
and as you develop a new short-term goal,

263
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:12,632
maybe you achieve your medium-term goal,

264
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:15,192
but there's always something that you're looking forward to,

265
00:17:15,192 --> 00:17:17,253
something that is coming up,

266
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:19,994
that's important to you as a player.

267
00:17:19,994 --> 00:17:23,735
And the more you can get the player kind of thinking into the future,

268
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:25,115
thinking about what am I going to do next.

269
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:29,865
what are my plans, I think that's what's compelling,

270
00:17:29,865 --> 00:17:34,006
that's what creates the one more turn or the one more race

271
00:17:34,006 --> 00:17:36,627
or the one more battle or whatever,

272
00:17:36,627 --> 00:17:38,427
one more of whatever you have in your game,

273
00:17:38,427 --> 00:17:39,388
you want the player to kind

274
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:41,868
of always be looking forward to that one more.

275
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:51,519
Another type of decision that might not sound like it falls into the same category as some of these other ones,

276
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,462
but is actually pretty important to the player, is the idea of customizing.

277
00:17:55,462 --> 00:18:02,188
Investing the player, if you're playing a racing game for example, is picking the color of your car.

278
00:18:02,188 --> 00:18:03,449
It seems fairly...

279
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,091
straightforward, but that gives the player an investment in...

280
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:11,993
they made a decision that invests them in the game. In Civilization, you can name

281
00:18:11,993 --> 00:18:12,473
your cities.

282
00:18:12,473 --> 00:18:17,255
It doesn't really affect the play of the game, but it's a decision that the player

283
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:18,096
makes that

284
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:20,016
that makes them more connected to this particular...

285
00:18:21,357 --> 00:18:24,919
game that they're playing. In a role-playing game, you might be able to choose the gender

286
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:30,421
of your hero or different characteristics, dress them in different ways, whatever. Think

287
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:36,204
about ways of investing the player in your game by inviting them to make decisions that

288
00:18:36,204 --> 00:18:40,907
let them express their personality or their gaming style.

289
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:41,527
So those are

290
00:18:47,497 --> 00:18:51,478
some different types of decisions that I think it's worth looking at your game and trying

291
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:57,979
to find ways to include in them. Now, when you present these decisions, it's really important

292
00:18:57,979 --> 00:19:03,281
how they're presented and how you respond to them. And we'll talk about that for just a second.

293
00:19:05,968 --> 00:19:09,450
information does the player have as they're about to make a decision?

294
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:13,752
And it's very easy for us as designers who've played the game

295
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:17,894
hundreds of times to assume the player knows everything that we know

296
00:19:17,894 --> 00:19:21,195
when we get to this point. And that's a very dangerous assumption.

297
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:23,537
It's probably one of the most common...

298
00:19:24,393 --> 00:19:30,339
problems I see with games in development is that you assume the player knows this or that or whatever

299
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:35,904
and you give the player this decision where they feel kind of totally lost and they're

300
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:41,149
they make it and then they feel they're uncomfortable about making it and then they

301
00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:42,450
keep you know it's a kind of a

302
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:45,977
gnaws at you.

303
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:49,298
If you made a decision and you're not really sure whether

304
00:19:49,298 --> 00:19:53,819
it was the right one or what the impact of it is, it kind

305
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:58,520
of really hurts your game playing experience.

306
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,461
So I think it's worth almost erring on the side of

307
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:05,002
presenting the player with too much information, or at

308
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:08,103
least enough that they feel that they're comfortable with

309
00:20:08,103 --> 00:20:10,843
understanding what the choice is that you're

310
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,424
giving the player.

311
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,979
found that you want to manage the number of decisions.

312
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:20,180
I think early on in some of our Civ designs,

313
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,742
you were faced with choosing from among seven or nine

314
00:20:23,742 --> 00:20:26,084
or 12 different technologies you could research.

315
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:30,306
And we really found that players have a tolerance

316
00:20:30,306 --> 00:20:34,068
for a smaller number of the, you know,

317
00:20:34,068 --> 00:20:37,170
I think three, five is a kind of a comfortable number

318
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:41,112
to choose from, but just be aware that

319
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,041
it's pretty easy to overwhelm players at this point.

320
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,261
So, especially early in the game,

321
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:48,262
you want them to feel that they're kind of going down.

322
00:20:48,262 --> 00:20:52,363
If they choose the default or they choose

323
00:20:52,363 --> 00:20:53,683
what the advisor is recommending,

324
00:20:53,683 --> 00:20:54,904
it's probably not such a bad decision.

325
00:20:54,904 --> 00:20:58,165
So, be sure there's enough information there

326
00:20:58,165 --> 00:21:02,586
when the decision is presented to the player.

327
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:06,167
Another thing to be really aware of is that...

328
00:21:07,304 --> 00:21:10,106
there's a learning curve to playing your games that ties

329
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:13,088
into how much information the player needs to be presented

330
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:13,389
early on.

331
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:18,333
And as the players get better, as you get better in your

332
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:22,075
playing the game, your expectations for what you need

333
00:21:22,075 --> 00:21:24,377
to know to make an informed decision will change.

334
00:21:24,377 --> 00:21:31,162
So what we do almost from the beginning of our development

335
00:21:31,162 --> 00:21:33,784
is to try and introduce our game to new players and

336
00:21:33,784 --> 00:21:36,046
understand what the game feels like at the very early part of

337
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:36,607
the process.

338
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:41,633
of the learning curve.

339
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:49,517
We have some friends in terms of kind of making players comfortable and enjoying our decisions,

340
00:21:49,517 --> 00:21:52,158
and we call them genre conventions.

341
00:21:52,158 --> 00:21:56,479
In other words, things that you know from having played other games in this genre.

342
00:21:56,479 --> 00:22:01,321
Very helpful in terms of interface conventions, for example, if you're playing a shooter,

343
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:05,823
you can understand which button does what, and when you move the joystick this way, this

344
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:06,863
is what's supposed to happen.

345
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,072
By, for goodness sake, use those genre conventions.

346
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:15,674
There's nothing more disconcerting than having the wrong thing happen

347
00:22:15,674 --> 00:22:18,675
when you press a button that in every other game does X.

348
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:25,378
But just satisfying the genre conventions is not really enough to make a new game.

349
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:31,181
So that's why I suggest you take advantage of all those conventions out there

350
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:32,922
to make the game very comfortable to your player.

351
00:22:33,569 --> 00:22:40,551
but then do more, add something new, a new button that does something cool, a new feature.

352
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:45,573
But be sure and take advantage of these conventions because they will make the player feel very,

353
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:51,075
very comfortable in your world and again start thinking in the future about what they want

354
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:56,197
to do as opposed to thinking about the present and how does this game actually work.

355
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,471
It's one of the reasons that a lot of our games involve historical topics,

356
00:23:02,471 --> 00:23:08,992
is because the player can bring to a historical topic a lot of information that they kind of already know.

357
00:23:08,992 --> 00:23:13,253
And it's important to reinforce that information for the player.

358
00:23:13,253 --> 00:23:19,794
If they run into Genghis Khan in a Civilization game, he's going to be kind of angry and aggressive.

359
00:23:19,794 --> 00:23:24,595
I think that makes the player feel, I kind of get where he's coming from.

360
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:28,015
You don't have to explain it in a massive civilopedia.

361
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:31,910
or Gandhi, you know, he's got his own personality.

362
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:35,572
So, uh, or if you're building a game about, uh,

363
00:23:35,572 --> 00:23:39,674
railroads or pirates, there's, there's a lot that the player

364
00:23:39,674 --> 00:23:44,157
can bring to a topic like that to, uh, that they already know.

365
00:23:44,157 --> 00:23:46,699
And all you need to do really, uh, design-wise,

366
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:48,340
is to kind of reinforce a little bit of that.

367
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,722
And, you know, if there's an evil Spaniard in a...

368
00:23:53,147 --> 00:23:57,450
beautiful governor's daughter and a few things like that, you understand that this is the

369
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:02,933
world that's being created for you and you can kind of go forward.

370
00:24:02,933 --> 00:24:08,096
It's not only true of historical games, but we have a world where sci-fi games have their

371
00:24:08,096 --> 00:24:08,917
own set of conventions.

372
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:14,941
And it's important that you understand them and make the player feel comfortable in that

373
00:24:14,941 --> 00:24:15,621
world.

374
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:20,764
Now if you want to break a few or change it up a little bit, that's fine, but make sure

375
00:24:20,764 --> 00:24:22,225
the player understands where.

376
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:26,559
that you're doing that and and that this is the cool part of your game

377
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,642
but this doesn't destroy, you know, make all the other decisions in the game

378
00:24:30,642 --> 00:24:33,685
ones where they don't, they kind of have to figure out on their own what the

379
00:24:33,685 --> 00:24:37,649
what the world is like. It's one of the reasons I love zombies

380
00:24:37,649 --> 00:24:44,195
is, um, they're very clear. Zombies, the motivation of zombies is clear

381
00:24:44,195 --> 00:24:48,438
very little explanation has to happen to the player. You know, zombies have

382
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:53,468
have their problems and it's very clear how you need to solve those problems.

383
00:24:53,468 --> 00:25:01,612
So, it's kind of an example of a decision that doesn't have to, you don't have to add

384
00:25:01,612 --> 00:25:06,074
a lot of information to the player. They pretty much know what to do.

385
00:25:06,074 --> 00:25:11,476
And so it's a very clear, setting up a decision like that is very clear.

386
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:17,049
On the other hand, once a player has made a decision, it is very, very important how

387
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,513
you respond to this decision.

388
00:25:19,513 --> 00:25:23,158
And it's another place where a lot of times we kind of fall down.

389
00:25:23,158 --> 00:25:28,346
The worst thing you can do is basically just move on.

390
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:43,318
Uh, there's nothing more paranoia inducing than having made a decision and, and, and the game just kind of goes on and you, you know, at least give a sound effect or something to indicate that, yes, I heard what you said and I'm, I'm, I'm going to do it, you know.

391
00:25:43,318 --> 00:25:48,943
Uh, ideally, uh, the more you can respond, uh, the better.

392
00:25:48,943 --> 00:25:50,485
We found in, in, uh, in, in.

393
00:25:52,144 --> 00:25:56,107
revolution that players were just so happy

394
00:25:56,107 --> 00:26:00,591
to get this feedback from. A lot of times you'd be talking to a leader of another

395
00:26:00,591 --> 00:26:04,734
civilization and you'd be negotiating about war, peace, or trading things.

396
00:26:04,734 --> 00:26:08,997
But they would make these kind of aside comments like, you know,

397
00:26:08,997 --> 00:26:11,760
I noticed you moved your phalanx next to my city over there.

398
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,280
What's up with that?

399
00:26:14,307 --> 00:26:17,430
Um, that unit you have has won five battles, you know, in a row.

400
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,431
That's very cool.

401
00:26:19,431 --> 00:26:24,555
Or they really started to interact with you as a player and give you almost more feedback

402
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:26,016
than, than, than necessary.

403
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:31,621
But it's very important that you respond to the player as they make a decision in a, in

404
00:26:31,621 --> 00:26:37,825
a way that, uh, one, they understand that you heard them and, and, and you're moving

405
00:26:37,825 --> 00:26:38,566
on.

406
00:26:38,566 --> 00:26:42,369
But you can actually build on that to suggest, uh, different things.

407
00:26:42,795 --> 00:26:48,902
Like, okay, you know, you chose that option, that could work, but, you know, if you'd done

408
00:26:48,902 --> 00:26:50,845
this, maybe this might have happened.

409
00:26:52,159 --> 00:27:00,585
fine, you know, attack me, you know, but you could have, we could have been friends and I would have given you some technology or whatever.

410
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:04,387
So, you can introduce into your response to the player

411
00:27:04,387 --> 00:27:10,512
some ideas about other courses of action that they could take or what they might do the next time they play the game.

412
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:14,134
So, responding to the player's decision is a time to really...

413
00:27:15,837 --> 00:27:20,360
think about how you do that and make it a kind of a rewarding experience.

414
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:26,223
It kind of comes down to the, does anybody know I'm here factor.

415
00:27:26,223 --> 00:27:30,005
Basically, if you're playing a single player game,

416
00:27:31,005 --> 00:27:37,709
You are imagining yourself as the leader of a great civilization, or a super-duper race car driver,

417
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:44,733
or science fiction fantasy hero with huge bulging muscles.

418
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:48,395
And, but you're really just sitting there in front of your computer in your lonely room

419
00:27:48,395 --> 00:27:53,938
with the glow from the monitor on your face.

420
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:58,340
And it's really important to let the player know that you know that they're there,

421
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,841
that you know that they're playing.

422
00:28:00,151 --> 00:28:06,915
that you're a partner with them, you're right there next to them all the way and yes, you

423
00:28:06,915 --> 00:28:11,719
are the leader of a great civilization or yes, you are a fantastic race car driver or

424
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:18,824
yes, your muscles are super bulging. And the response that you give to the player's decisions

425
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:26,609
is really the tool that you have to do that. Whether it's a sound, a text, visual, a graphic,

426
00:28:26,609 --> 00:28:29,731
you know, think of the tools that you have to kind of...

427
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:35,115
really reinforce what the player, the fantasy that the player is creating in their mind

428
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:42,962
and really allow them to, to enjoy that.

429
00:28:42,962 --> 00:28:49,648
So what I'm, what I hope is part of your design process is what, what I'm calling a decision

430
00:28:49,648 --> 00:28:55,033
feedback loop. In other words, that you're constantly iterating on your design and

431
00:28:56,603 --> 00:29:03,187
uh, those ideas that you get from your players, etc. are being tried out and I mean, it's

432
00:29:03,187 --> 00:29:08,491
really, uh, can't recommend enough the idea of having a tight iteration loop on your game

433
00:29:08,491 --> 00:29:13,635
design and having as many people play it as possible and try and feed that, uh, feed that

434
00:29:13,635 --> 00:29:14,936
information back into your design.

435
00:29:14,936 --> 00:29:16,457
The more times you can go around that loop.

436
00:29:17,353 --> 00:29:19,574
I think the better your game is going to be.

437
00:29:19,574 --> 00:29:21,896
So it's really, I think, important to try and structure

438
00:29:21,896 --> 00:29:25,219
your technology or design process

439
00:29:25,219 --> 00:29:27,401
to allow that kind of iteration.

440
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:29,583
So hopefully you're listening to a lot of players

441
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,384
and getting a lot of feedback.

442
00:29:31,384 --> 00:29:33,146
Obviously, you can't do everything.

443
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:34,947
Some ideas might be good or bad.

444
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:38,250
But the more ideas that you are able to kind of process,

445
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:40,352
I think the better your game will be.

446
00:29:41,785 --> 00:29:49,771
It is useful to kind of understand the different kinds of players that you will be dealing

447
00:29:49,771 --> 00:29:53,795
with and talking to as you kind of expose your game to your playtesters and your friends

448
00:29:53,795 --> 00:29:54,575
and your co-

449
00:29:55,112 --> 00:29:58,974
coworkers or whoever you are able to get to test your game,

450
00:29:58,974 --> 00:30:01,456
you're going to get a lot of different kinds of response.

451
00:30:01,456 --> 00:30:06,359
And it's really up to you as a designer to filter that and

452
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:09,541
decide what is really going to help my game, what is going to

453
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,663
make it better, or what's an interesting idea but doesn't

454
00:30:12,663 --> 00:30:15,625
fit this game or is not going to work.

455
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:20,528
So it's kind of useful to know a little bit about the types

456
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:23,190
of players that you'll probably start to get some feedback

457
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:23,410
from.

458
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:31,572
Um, the first player is Mr. Kickbutt here. And you may, I'm not going to ask you to raise

459
00:30:31,572 --> 00:30:39,416
your hand, but some of you may recognize yourself in this, in this player. Um, this is the player

460
00:30:39,416 --> 00:30:45,219
who only cares about winning the game. They're only, if they won the game, it's great, it's

461
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:46,460
awesome, it's the best game ever.

462
00:30:47,226 --> 00:30:52,268
If they lost, if they didn't win, then your game stinks and, and really, you know, you

463
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,788
should try something else.

464
00:30:53,788 --> 00:31:00,430
So this player's input is, is useful in terms of, uh, especially maybe tuning some of the

465
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:05,632
higher levels, the more advanced difficulty levels of the game, and, uh, getting a sense

466
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:10,433
of, of, of kind of those issues, but, but you kind of need to be careful because a lot

467
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:15,155
of times, uh, tuning up difficulty levels and things like that really doesn't come together

468
00:31:15,155 --> 00:31:15,875
till late in the game.

469
00:31:16,515 --> 00:31:21,317
and it can be kind of discouraging to hear from Mr. Kickbutt that your game was too easy

470
00:31:21,317 --> 00:31:28,020
or too hard or just, you know, uh, so be, be aware that some players, you know, their

471
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:32,722
focus is really on, on winning the game and, and their input just has to be kind of filtered

472
00:31:32,722 --> 00:31:39,765
that way. Um, there's Ms. Genre, that's another type of player that, that you, you may get

473
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:44,107
some input from. And, uh, again, it can be very useful. This is a player.

474
00:31:44,692 --> 00:31:52,835
that loves this specific genre, whether it's a first-person shooter or a real-time strategy

475
00:31:52,835 --> 00:31:58,237
or role-playing, and if your game fits exactly in that genre, this player will love it because

476
00:31:58,237 --> 00:32:04,199
it's like the games that they love. If there's any deviations from the conventions or the

477
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:08,900
standards of your genre, they will complain. It's, you know, it's in World of Warcraft,

478
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,722
they did this and you're doing that. That's not right.

479
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,361
again that's useful for understanding, uh, whether, uh,

480
00:32:18,361 --> 00:32:21,302
you're, you're, you're using the genre conventions, but

481
00:32:21,302 --> 00:32:25,963
hopefully you're trying a few new things and, uh, Ms. Genre

482
00:32:25,963 --> 00:32:28,584
here is not gonna be too happy if you, if you, if you

483
00:32:28,584 --> 00:32:31,805
stretch outside of the, of the genre conventions. Uh, we have

484
00:32:31,805 --> 00:32:37,427
Mr. Minmax, this is another kind of player, again, there

485
00:32:37,427 --> 00:32:41,688
may be a few of you out there, I don't know. Um...

486
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:48,590
We'll have some intervention sessions after to kind of help you break out of this mold.

487
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:56,473
But Mr. Minmax is basically someone who really needs to understand every algorithm and how

488
00:32:56,473 --> 00:33:01,815
to squeeze every last decimal point of advantage out of everything that can be done in the

489
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:02,315
game.

490
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:09,518
Again, a very useful point of view, but not the way everybody plays.

491
00:33:09,518 --> 00:33:12,559
So kind of filter this input.

492
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:20,414
a very useful way to maybe understand whether some of your algorithms are not balanced,

493
00:33:20,414 --> 00:33:20,554
etc.

494
00:33:20,554 --> 00:33:25,477
But Mr. Minmax is out there kind of really trying to unravel, reverse engineer your game

495
00:33:25,477 --> 00:33:27,899
and figure out exactly what's happening and use that to his advantage.

496
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:28,459
We have Ms. Paranoid.

497
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:34,123
This is a player, you've probably run into them, that is convinced that the computer

498
00:33:34,123 --> 00:33:36,324
is cheating on them.

499
00:33:36,324 --> 00:33:41,948
This is a player, you've probably run into them, that is convinced that the computer

500
00:33:41,948 --> 00:33:42,948
is cheating on them.

501
00:33:43,677 --> 00:33:49,620
knows exactly what they're trying to do and is foiling them at every opportunity.

502
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:56,164
If there's a random number die roll in the game, it always goes against them.

503
00:33:56,164 --> 00:34:04,108
And just kind of has this paranoid approach to your game.

504
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:10,312
I spoke a little bit in one of my other talks about Civ Revolution and how we actually ended

505
00:34:10,312 --> 00:34:12,733
up adjusting some of the die rolls.

506
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:19,132
uh, making sure that two bad things didn't happen in a row, for example, and things that

507
00:34:19,132 --> 00:34:24,393
would kind of trigger the paranoid, uh, response in Ms. Paranoid. So it's a word, again, these

508
00:34:24,393 --> 00:34:31,616
are all viewpoints that are worth listening to, but, uh, in, in each case, probably can't

509
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:36,557
use all of, all of these, uh, players' ideas, but it is, it's kind of useful to understand

510
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:40,799
where these players are coming from and, and what their reactions might be to your, to

511
00:34:40,799 --> 00:34:41,199
your game.

512
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:49,934
There's Mr. History. Mr. History is going to tell you, wait a minute, you know, the 24th

513
00:34:49,934 --> 00:34:55,660
Michigan didn't arrive on the battlefield at Gettysburg until 1030, you know, you've got them

514
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:04,228
coming in at 1015. Or this didn't really happen, or this didn't, again, interesting, useful

515
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:04,848
input, but...

516
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:13,562
maybe not what you're basing the most important thing to your game. So Mr. History is going to

517
00:35:13,562 --> 00:35:20,266
give you some good background, etc. But not every player out there is going to be Mr. History, so

518
00:35:20,266 --> 00:35:31,432
you really want to appeal to somewhat a broader audience. There's Mr. Bubble Boy. This is a

519
00:35:31,432 --> 00:35:33,994
player that will remember the one...

520
00:35:35,488 --> 00:35:38,353
moment in your game when something bad happened to them.

521
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:42,080
They could be having a wonderful experience, but if some...

522
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,648
just at one point they had a setback or something unfortunate happened...

523
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:53,374
um, that's really what the, that was their game experience for them. And I think it's really, you

524
00:35:53,374 --> 00:36:00,858
need to present setbacks in a, in a, in a very sensitive, uh, way where the player understands

525
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:04,900
why it happened, what they can do, uh, next time to, to prevent it from happening or go in a

526
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:10,763
different direction. But you may have some players where, where one, one incident in your game

527
00:36:10,763 --> 00:36:15,946
kind of colors their entire experience. Oh, um, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,

528
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:21,494
And again, these are things that you'll fix, that you'll tune out as you develop, that

529
00:36:21,494 --> 00:36:28,879
will get fixed. But if this player's input to you is totally derived from that one experience,

530
00:36:28,879 --> 00:36:34,543
then you kind of have to filter that out. And then there's Mr. Designer. This is another

531
00:36:34,543 --> 00:36:40,787
kind of player that you'll get feedback from. Basically, they have another game in mind,

532
00:36:40,787 --> 00:36:42,228
which they wish you were making.

533
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,911
And all of their input is kind of like why your game isn't

534
00:36:47,911 --> 00:36:50,752
their game, or why your game isn't like the game that they

535
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:52,853
are wanting you to make.

536
00:36:52,853 --> 00:36:55,514
So that's, you know, that could be, again, some valuable

537
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:57,616
input, maybe you want to use a little bit of their idea.

538
00:36:57,616 --> 00:37:01,798
But just be aware that they're kind of trying to get you to

539
00:37:01,798 --> 00:37:03,499
design their game and not the game that you're making.

540
00:37:03,499 --> 00:37:05,460
OK, so we've got a game that we're working on.

541
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:05,600
And.

542
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:18,491
It's cool, it's pretty good, it's fun, kind of fun, but how do we make it better?

543
00:37:18,491 --> 00:37:22,936
How do we take the decisions that we have and make them even more interesting?

544
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:30,393
The first thing that we look at, I think, is often just the balance of the decisions.

545
00:37:30,393 --> 00:37:35,676
A lot of times, just simply fixing the balance is going to help your decisions to be, make

546
00:37:35,676 --> 00:37:36,796
your decisions a lot more interesting.

547
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:41,259
We talked at the very beginning about how most decisions involve some sort of trade-off.

548
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,080
You know, I'm going to buy a sword, but it's going to cost me 300 gold.

549
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,702
You may find that nobody's buying that sword.

550
00:37:47,702 --> 00:37:50,204
Well, that might be an indication that it should cost 200 gold.

551
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:56,951
Or you may find that everybody is walking around with one of these $300 swords.

552
00:37:56,951 --> 00:37:58,472
Maybe it's, maybe it should be $500.

553
00:37:58,472 --> 00:38:03,976
So, one of the early things to look at is just, is it simply a balance issue.

554
00:38:03,976 --> 00:38:08,960
That my decision would be more interesting with a different sort of balance attached to it.

555
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,863
Again, it can apply to any, if you have a racing game, you know,

556
00:38:12,863 --> 00:38:17,987
those cool tires are too expensive or too cheap, et cetera.

557
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:22,523
Another way of making your decisions more interesting,

558
00:38:22,523 --> 00:38:24,684
I think, is to make them more important.

559
00:38:24,684 --> 00:38:28,005
Again, we're kind of talking in a very kind of abstract terms,

560
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:29,725
but your game is about something.

561
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:30,805
It's about something cool.

562
00:38:30,805 --> 00:38:31,585
It's about something neat.

563
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:38,007
Make the decision, tie more directly and coolly

564
00:38:38,007 --> 00:38:41,287
into what your game is about.

565
00:38:41,287 --> 00:38:42,548
Make it more significant.

566
00:38:42,548 --> 00:38:48,269
Make the sword shiny and have a sharpie edge made out

567
00:38:48,269 --> 00:38:49,109
of titanium or something.

568
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:57,673
You know, find ways to bring your game fantasy back into decisions to make them feel more important.

569
00:38:57,673 --> 00:39:04,377
Again, in Civilization, talking to the other leaders gives the decisions that you make there

570
00:39:04,377 --> 00:39:06,358
and the interaction that you have feel more important.

571
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:09,019
I mean, those could be simple check boxes, you know,

572
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:11,921
but having the other leader there animated and talking to you

573
00:39:11,921 --> 00:39:16,043
gives those kind of decisions a feeling of greater importance.

574
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:17,203
Whatever your game is about.

575
00:39:17,859 --> 00:39:20,681
Feed more of that directly into your decision making.

576
00:39:20,681 --> 00:39:24,843
And I think it'll feel more important and have more

577
00:39:24,843 --> 00:39:25,303
character.

578
00:39:25,303 --> 00:39:31,646
Control the amount of information that the player has

579
00:39:31,646 --> 00:39:34,188
when they're making decisions.

580
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:37,930
Again, coming back to civilization, we have a system

581
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,831
where the world is gradually revealed.

582
00:39:40,831 --> 00:39:44,573
And that really affects a lot of the decisions that the

583
00:39:44,573 --> 00:39:45,834
player makes.

584
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:50,799
Imagine a Civ game where the entire map was revealed at the very beginning.

585
00:39:50,799 --> 00:39:54,522
I mean, that would be a very different game experience.

586
00:39:54,522 --> 00:39:59,866
And so by managing the amount of information that the player has, you can make your decisions

587
00:39:59,866 --> 00:40:00,986
more interesting.

588
00:40:00,986 --> 00:40:05,650
In other situations, giving the player more information might be the way of making that

589
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,952
decision more interesting.

590
00:40:07,952 --> 00:40:12,475
If they knew more about what was going on in the rest of the world, they might feel

591
00:40:12,475 --> 00:40:15,317
better and find the decisions to be more interesting.

592
00:40:15,317 --> 00:40:15,397
So...

593
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:20,299
look at the amount of information that the player has as they

594
00:40:20,299 --> 00:40:23,301
look at the decisions and see if

595
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:27,103
either giving them more information or less information would be a way to make

596
00:40:27,103 --> 00:40:29,284
that particular decision more more interesting.

597
00:40:33,025 --> 00:40:35,608
the number of choices you give the player.

598
00:40:35,608 --> 00:40:40,654
As designers, we think we get paid by the decision, by the choice.

599
00:40:40,654 --> 00:40:44,958
The more choices we give the player, the better designers we are,

600
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:46,000
and the more we ought to get paid.

601
00:40:47,691 --> 00:40:55,494
Be careful of that philosophy because the player is easily overwhelmed and you may find

602
00:40:55,494 --> 00:41:00,697
that by managing the number of choices that you give the player, you actually make the

603
00:41:00,697 --> 00:41:05,479
decision more interesting, often by kind of cutting them down, maybe combining two or

604
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:06,879
three together, things like that.

605
00:41:06,879 --> 00:41:12,302
Look at the number of decisions that you're providing the player to see if it might not

606
00:41:12,302 --> 00:41:14,603
be more interesting if you did it a little differently.

607
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:23,834
Um, making them more flavorful. Uh, this is really a presentation issue. You know, a lot of

608
00:41:23,834 --> 00:41:29,517
times designers, we think we can, we can design a game text only with programmer graphics and it

609
00:41:29,517 --> 00:41:30,418
would be totally cool.

610
00:41:31,308 --> 00:41:32,588
Well, that's fine.

611
00:41:32,588 --> 00:41:35,529
But take advantage of those artists, those writers, those

612
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:39,270
sound guys, all those other people that are working on

613
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:43,612
your project to add more flavor and interest and

614
00:41:43,612 --> 00:41:46,373
excitement to your decisions.

615
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:49,994
Again, coming back to civilization, interacting

616
00:41:49,994 --> 00:41:52,655
directly with the great leaders.

617
00:41:52,655 --> 00:41:55,575
In a racing game, as you add stuff to your car, it rotates

618
00:41:55,575 --> 00:41:56,896
around and light shines on it.

619
00:41:57,462 --> 00:42:00,285
and cool stuff happens with your hero.

620
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:06,090
You see the new equipment being put on them,

621
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:08,232
and they smile, and you find ways

622
00:42:08,232 --> 00:42:12,016
to just add that kind of game flavor to your decisions,

623
00:42:12,016 --> 00:42:13,478
and that's another way of making them more interesting.

624
00:42:13,478 --> 00:42:17,782
Look at how much time you're giving the player

625
00:42:17,782 --> 00:42:18,783
to make a decision.

626
00:42:18,783 --> 00:42:21,225
It's...I think it's...

627
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:27,472
It's really key to understand that most genres are almost

628
00:42:27,472 --> 00:42:30,214
defined by the amount of time you give the player.

629
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:34,037
It may seem like a minor issue, but if you change the

630
00:42:34,037 --> 00:42:36,418
amount of time that you give the player to make decisions,

631
00:42:36,418 --> 00:42:38,660
you're almost stepping into a new genre.

632
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:43,023
If you're playing Civilization, which is turn

633
00:42:43,023 --> 00:42:44,604
based, you make it real time.

634
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:47,446
All of a sudden, you're playing a game like Age of

635
00:42:47,446 --> 00:42:48,166
Empires or RTS.

636
00:42:49,907 --> 00:42:54,630
playing a shooter and it's moving very quickly and you slow down the time frame, all of a sudden

637
00:42:54,630 --> 00:43:01,833
you're playing a sneaking around game and a whole different feeling. So by looking at the amount of

638
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:05,995
time you're giving the player to make decisions, you're almost defining what genre you're in.

639
00:43:05,995 --> 00:43:12,199
And do you want to slide your game a little more in one direction, genre direction or another?

640
00:43:12,199 --> 00:43:18,242
And there's also basically an inverse relationship between how long you give the player to make a

641
00:43:18,242 --> 00:43:19,042
decision and how...

642
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,601
deep and complex that decision is going to be.

643
00:43:21,601 --> 00:43:24,742
You have to be careful to manage that balance.

644
00:43:24,742 --> 00:43:28,303
If you're playing a game with very complicated decisions that

645
00:43:28,303 --> 00:43:31,424
come at you one after the other, the player's basically

646
00:43:31,424 --> 00:43:36,466
going to feel overwhelmed and out of control,

647
00:43:36,466 --> 00:43:38,547
never having a chance to look forward and anticipate

648
00:43:38,547 --> 00:43:40,408
what they're going to do next, but always trying to figure out

649
00:43:40,408 --> 00:43:41,788
what's going on right now.

650
00:43:41,788 --> 00:43:44,429
On the other hand, if you give the player

651
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:47,510
some very simple decisions at a very slow pace,

652
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:54,072
they're kind of bored. That's a boring game. I won't mention any names, but.

653
00:43:54,072 --> 00:44:03,596
And the last way to make a decision more interesting is to get rid of it. If you've tried all these

654
00:44:03,596 --> 00:44:10,180
things and they don't work, maybe the decision just is not one that should, you know, should

655
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:16,322
take out of your game. Be, be ruthless in terms of cutting things out. Generally, we

656
00:44:16,322 --> 00:44:17,123
find that.

657
00:44:17,734 --> 00:44:20,797
probably a third of the things that we try, if not more,

658
00:44:20,797 --> 00:44:26,423
eventually end up getting taken out of the game because they just aren't fun and interesting enough.

659
00:44:26,423 --> 00:44:30,427
So again, as designers we don't get paid by the decision,

660
00:44:30,427 --> 00:44:32,889
we get paid by how good our game's at the end of the day,

661
00:44:32,889 --> 00:44:37,454
and it may be the best decision to get rid of your...

662
00:44:37,454 --> 00:44:38,335
whatever's not working.

663
00:44:39,987 --> 00:44:43,029
So we've talked about, in theoretical terms,

664
00:44:43,029 --> 00:44:45,911
all these different ways of looking at your decisions,

665
00:44:45,911 --> 00:44:49,274
perhaps making them more interesting,

666
00:44:49,274 --> 00:44:53,757
finding ways to maximize the decision-making process

667
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,258
of your game.

668
00:44:55,258 --> 00:44:57,659
But really, I don't want to.

669
00:44:58,973 --> 00:45:02,454
I don't want to forget that your game is more than just decisions.

670
00:45:02,454 --> 00:45:07,576
I think once you've got the game working and you've got all these cool decisions in there

671
00:45:07,576 --> 00:45:13,117
and the players are, you've really kind of tuned that part of the game, you need to,

672
00:45:13,117 --> 00:45:14,998
to remystify your game.

673
00:45:14,998 --> 00:45:19,479
Really make it about the fantasy that you're trying to create for the player.

674
00:45:19,479 --> 00:45:25,820
It's, it's the combination of this wonderful fantasy world that you create and the interesting

675
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,261
decisions that the player gets to make in that, in that world.

676
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:32,305
that really is the sum total of the quality of your game.

677
00:45:32,305 --> 00:45:37,470
So we want you to maximize the awesomeness of your game world,

678
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,993
of the graphics, of the way that you present it.

679
00:45:39,993 --> 00:45:46,700
These are all very important tools that augment these decisions that you have

680
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:51,805
to make the game maximally awesome.

681
00:45:54,582 --> 00:45:57,624
And we encourage you to make it epic.

682
00:45:57,624 --> 00:46:03,286
Again, we're inviting the player to step into your

683
00:46:03,286 --> 00:46:06,728
designed world and become some awesome character.

684
00:46:06,728 --> 00:46:12,950
And we're fulfilling this fantasy for us to step out of

685
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:18,033
our humdrum lives and become great heroes.

686
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:23,204
I don't want to, by focusing on all the kind of minutiae of making decisions and how to

687
00:46:23,204 --> 00:46:27,908
make them better, lose sight of the story that you're telling.

688
00:46:28,282 --> 00:46:32,804
the world that you're inviting the player to step into, and

689
00:46:32,804 --> 00:46:38,027
the ways that you can really tie your decisions to

690
00:46:38,027 --> 00:46:40,969
reinforcing that world, creating that world in the

691
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:41,649
player's mind.

692
00:46:41,649 --> 00:46:44,490
I think that's the best of all worlds is where you've

693
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:48,232
imagined this incredible world that's going to be a great

694
00:46:48,232 --> 00:46:50,414
place to inhabit and live and explore.

695
00:46:50,414 --> 00:46:53,335
And then, by the way you present decisions to the

696
00:46:53,335 --> 00:46:55,957
player, you've got their imagination totally hooked

697
00:46:55,957 --> 00:46:56,697
into that world.

698
00:46:57,057 --> 00:47:00,519
and they're thinking about all the possibilities and what they're going to do next,

699
00:47:00,519 --> 00:47:04,541
and what's going to happen as they wander through your world.

700
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:07,102
So the two really reinforce each other.

701
00:47:07,102 --> 00:47:11,564
I think if you present a really awesome fantasy to the player,

702
00:47:11,564 --> 00:47:14,726
they're going to jump in there, and once they get in there,

703
00:47:14,726 --> 00:47:17,747
if they've got cool things to do, cool decisions to make,

704
00:47:17,747 --> 00:47:20,168
and ways that they...

705
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:23,632
think about replayability, next time I play this game I'm going to do this,

706
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:27,937
different ways to win, different paths through the game, if you can present that,

707
00:47:27,937 --> 00:47:32,061
all those things to them in terms of decisions that they make, you've

708
00:47:32,061 --> 00:47:35,184
really got a huge win there by combining

709
00:47:35,184 --> 00:47:39,269
this awesome world that you've created with these

710
00:47:39,269 --> 00:47:42,272
great decisions that the player makes while they're in there.

711
00:47:46,067 --> 00:48:06,597
So that concludes this dissertation on interesting decisions. I appreciate your indulgence.

712
00:48:06,597 --> 00:48:11,860
We do have a little time for questions if there are any questions. Yes?

713
00:48:20,399 --> 00:48:22,001
A Pirates fan?

714
00:48:22,001 --> 00:48:27,108
I guess we're going to line up at the microphones.

715
00:48:27,108 --> 00:48:31,214
So on those lines, what was the key decision in making it,

716
00:48:31,214 --> 00:48:34,278
or never offering, a multiplayer experience?

717
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,100
A multiplayer experience in Pirates?

718
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:40,252
Multiplayer is actually tough.

719
00:48:40,252 --> 00:48:44,135
I think the thing that we look at first

720
00:48:44,135 --> 00:48:46,776
is symmetry versus asymmetry.

721
00:48:46,776 --> 00:48:49,298
In a game like Civilization or Age of Empires or many others,

722
00:48:49,298 --> 00:48:53,741
there are multiple similar actors in the game.

723
00:48:53,741 --> 00:48:58,284
And those kind of games are easy to make into multiplayer.

724
00:48:58,284 --> 00:49:00,265
In a single player, the AI takes over.

725
00:49:00,892 --> 00:49:05,055
some of those actors in multiplayer, everybody takes over one.

726
00:49:05,055 --> 00:49:08,057
In a game like Pirates or many others, there's kind of one

727
00:49:08,057 --> 00:49:11,438
hero and the world revolves around what that one hero does

728
00:49:11,438 --> 00:49:13,540
and that's a difficult situation to...

729
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:18,182
there's only room in this world for one hero and

730
00:49:18,182 --> 00:49:21,724
so that would require just a very significant game redesign

731
00:49:21,724 --> 00:49:26,627
to make Pirates a multiplayer game, for example.

732
00:49:26,627 --> 00:49:27,368
Thanks.

733
00:49:28,292 --> 00:49:36,275
My question is, one thing I noticed in a lot of strategy games is that an interesting

734
00:49:36,275 --> 00:49:41,036
decision over time can become mundane or monotonous.

735
00:49:41,036 --> 00:49:47,378
Like, building your units in one city in the first few turns is interesting, but when you're

736
00:49:47,378 --> 00:49:49,018
like 200, 300 turns in and you've got...

737
00:49:49,452 --> 00:49:54,234
12 different cities, 12 different new production structures, just becomes mundane.

738
00:49:54,234 --> 00:49:58,616
Is there a way to combat that or is it just an eventuality with decisions?

739
00:49:58,616 --> 00:50:01,137
I think there's definitely a way to combat that.

740
00:50:01,137 --> 00:50:07,059
I mean you have to, uh, you're basically dealing with a problem which you have in many games

741
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:10,361
is you want the player to feel that they're advancing and moving forward and things are

742
00:50:10,361 --> 00:50:11,802
getting bigger and larger and whatever.

743
00:50:13,018 --> 00:50:18,922
without getting more complicated or more micromanage-y, et cetera.

744
00:50:18,922 --> 00:50:22,984
So I think there are a couple of tools that you can use.

745
00:50:22,984 --> 00:50:27,026
One that we use sometimes in civilization

746
00:50:27,026 --> 00:50:30,448
is making, as your capabilities to build things grows,

747
00:50:30,448 --> 00:50:33,690
the things that you build get bigger and more expensive,

748
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:35,431
but cooler in exchange for that.

749
00:50:35,431 --> 00:50:37,732
So that you're building as you're

750
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:43,512
capability to build grows, you're exposed to things that are more expensive but more

751
00:50:43,512 --> 00:50:47,633
cool so that the total number of things that you're working on or building kind of stays

752
00:50:47,633 --> 00:50:52,835
somewhat constant. As the world grows, you get units that move quicker. So, again, it

753
00:50:52,835 --> 00:50:56,377
takes the same relative amount of time to get from one side of the world to the other.

754
00:50:56,377 --> 00:51:02,779
I think it's definitely an issue, but I think there are design techniques that you can use

755
00:51:02,779 --> 00:51:05,540
to address some of those concerns.

756
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:07,001
Thank you.

757
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:14,106
Hi, um, I found, uh, economic theory to be quite interesting when, when I'm designing

758
00:51:14,106 --> 00:51:18,890
decisions, you know, stuff like opportunity cost. And I was wondering if that's something

759
00:51:18,890 --> 00:51:21,372
that, that you've looked at or that you use.

760
00:51:21,372 --> 00:51:30,099
I think, uh, yes in terms of, in general, in a general sense, uh, economics is, is probably

761
00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:34,322
a very interesting way to look at almost any game situation in terms of the tradeoffs involved

762
00:51:34,322 --> 00:51:35,843
and the costs. Um.

763
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:41,798
We don't have an economist on staff that kind of makes sure

764
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:43,740
we've got everything exactly right.

765
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:47,182
I think it's one of those situations where with some

766
00:51:47,182 --> 00:51:50,985
kind of basic concepts, you can get things feeling right.

767
00:51:50,985 --> 00:51:54,667
But the idea of trade-offs and opportunity costs and

768
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:57,789
investing for the future, I think those are all kind of

769
00:51:57,789 --> 00:52:00,831
fundamental ideas that are pretty intuitive to players.

770
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:02,773
I think that's the other thing, that we want to use

771
00:52:02,773 --> 00:52:05,455
those economic concepts that are intuitive to players.

772
00:52:05,932 --> 00:52:11,577
not try and require you to be a PhD in economics to play the

773
00:52:11,577 --> 00:52:15,420
games, but most of us understand that the idea of

774
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:19,244
cost and getting a good deal and that short-term versus

775
00:52:19,244 --> 00:52:22,687
long-term kind of things.

776
00:52:22,687 --> 00:52:23,067
Yes.

777
00:52:23,067 --> 00:52:23,367
Hi.

778
00:52:23,367 --> 00:52:23,948
Great talk.

779
00:52:23,948 --> 00:52:25,529
Really appreciate it.

780
00:52:25,529 --> 00:52:27,211
My question is kind of two parts.

781
00:52:27,211 --> 00:52:27,851
One.

782
00:52:28,867 --> 00:52:31,408
What processes or tools do you use to measure, uh,

783
00:52:31,408 --> 00:52:33,929
because games like Civ, you have a lot of people playing,

784
00:52:33,929 --> 00:52:34,790
they make a lot of decisions.

785
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:37,151
What do you use to measure, uh, the feedback

786
00:52:37,151 --> 00:52:38,592
and how you change your game based on that?

787
00:52:38,592 --> 00:52:40,153
And do you ever tailor your, um...

788
00:52:40,153 --> 00:52:43,475
do you ever tailor for the player

789
00:52:43,475 --> 00:52:45,396
the number of decisions you present to them?

790
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:47,477
So a support player doesn't like

791
00:52:47,477 --> 00:52:51,319
the massive, overwhelming, uh, number of decisions,

792
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:53,820
but a min-max player would probably love that.

793
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:54,721
So do you look at the personality types,

794
00:52:54,721 --> 00:52:55,561
try to figure out who they are,

795
00:52:55,561 --> 00:52:56,622
and tailor the experience for them?

796
00:52:56,622 --> 00:52:56,962
Uh...

797
00:52:58,147 --> 00:52:59,907
I'll answer the first part first.

798
00:52:59,907 --> 00:53:00,748
Second part first.

799
00:53:00,748 --> 00:53:04,249
There are ways to address different player types.

800
00:53:04,249 --> 00:53:08,170
I mean, in Civ, the most obvious ones are difficulty levels

801
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:08,971
and the size of the map.

802
00:53:08,971 --> 00:53:11,912
I mean, you can, by changing the size of the map,

803
00:53:11,912 --> 00:53:14,073
you can control, you know, do I have a super long,

804
00:53:14,073 --> 00:53:16,614
complicated game or a simpler game?

805
00:53:16,614 --> 00:53:19,415
And in terms of the feedback that we get from players,

806
00:53:21,756 --> 00:53:28,962
A lot of it initially is just us playing, but as the game gets more playable and kind of more fleshed out,

807
00:53:28,962 --> 00:53:31,524
we expand that circle to bring as many players in as we can.

808
00:53:31,524 --> 00:53:37,228
But one thing I didn't mention, but I think it is important that...

809
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:43,156
not everybody can play kind of a half fixed, half working, half broken game and kind of

810
00:53:43,156 --> 00:53:47,338
imagine what it might feel like when it's actually working. Um and those are the, those

811
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:50,619
are the testers, those are the people, those are the people who generate feedback that

812
00:53:50,619 --> 00:53:54,281
are really the most useful, that can kind of say well you know this was broken but I

813
00:53:54,281 --> 00:53:59,064
can imagine when it's working this would have been cool or I was able to get around that.

814
00:53:59,064 --> 00:54:02,306
Um you know some of your testers will be able to do that and they're gonna give you some

815
00:54:02,306 --> 00:54:06,648
very valuable input earlier in the process. At the end you kind of want people who are

816
00:54:07,105 --> 00:54:10,847
will complain about everything because you, your game needs to be perfect at that point

817
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:14,408
of view so you want, you want to bring those cranky people back again and sit them down

818
00:54:14,408 --> 00:54:19,030
in front of your game and say now play it and you know, is there anything that's bugging

819
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:19,690
you about this.

820
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:20,730
Thanks.

821
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:22,051
Yes.

822
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:27,833
Sometimes, especially in some specific genres, you have to balance actual decisions versus

823
00:54:27,833 --> 00:54:30,294
the illusion of decisions.

824
00:54:30,294 --> 00:54:33,355
How do you achieve that balance?

825
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,912
Illusion is your friend in game design.

826
00:54:38,912 --> 00:54:41,901
I mean, games are essentially an illusion.

827
00:54:41,901 --> 00:54:42,763
So I think that...

828
00:54:43,225 --> 00:54:46,026
I mean, we talked a little bit about making them flavorful,

829
00:54:46,026 --> 00:54:48,907
or the more of your game world that you can bring into the

830
00:54:48,907 --> 00:54:53,029
decision-making process, I think you kind of have to stay

831
00:54:53,029 --> 00:54:55,150
in character a lot of times in game design.

832
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:57,430
Yes, you are the king of a great civilization or this

833
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:58,611
incredible superhero.

834
00:54:58,611 --> 00:55:03,453
I think that it's important for the game to stay in

835
00:55:03,453 --> 00:55:07,754
character to help the player retain that suspension of

836
00:55:07,754 --> 00:55:11,616
disbelief and allow them to continue to believe that

837
00:55:11,616 --> 00:55:11,936
they are.

838
00:55:12,453 --> 00:55:17,837
they're in there. And I think that the idea of illusion, we're constantly amazed by what people

839
00:55:17,837 --> 00:55:25,223
think is in the game that's not really there. But, you know, if you present a consistent game

840
00:55:25,223 --> 00:55:30,787
world with some interesting decisions, the player's imagination will fill in, you know,

841
00:55:30,787 --> 00:55:34,710
I know Genghis Khan doesn't like me. He's probably talking to those other leaders about me when I'm

842
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:40,355
not there or, you know, whatever it is. I think if you provide enough hooks for the player to

843
00:55:40,355 --> 00:55:41,235
jump into your world.

844
00:55:41,495 --> 00:55:54,646
they'll fill in a lot more with their own imagination.

845
00:55:57,595 --> 00:56:00,897
you make really early in the stages of development.

846
00:56:00,897 --> 00:56:04,759
And later changing them, it's getting really difficult.

847
00:56:04,759 --> 00:56:07,640
So either it's only your own team,

848
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:11,061
or do you get a special interest group

849
00:56:11,061 --> 00:56:14,543
to do the early testing?

850
00:56:14,543 --> 00:56:17,884
We're pretty brutal about ripping out decisions

851
00:56:17,884 --> 00:56:19,045
and putting in different ones.

852
00:56:19,045 --> 00:56:22,926
There's a classic story with a game called Convolution,

853
00:56:22,926 --> 00:56:24,487
which we did in the 90s, I guess,

854
00:56:24,487 --> 00:56:27,128
where about two weeks before.

855
00:56:27,762 --> 00:56:31,285
We shipped it, we changed the radius of cities from two

856
00:56:31,285 --> 00:56:34,909
hexes to one, two squares to one square, which was kind of

857
00:56:34,909 --> 00:56:39,614
a totally radical change, but it just had to be done.

858
00:56:39,614 --> 00:56:43,478
So we're not, we try not to get wedded to decisions that

859
00:56:43,478 --> 00:56:46,362
we, things that we put in early on, and are pretty

860
00:56:46,362 --> 00:56:49,225
brutal about ripping them out and trying something different.

861
00:56:49,668 --> 00:56:54,471
On the other hand, you know, a lot of times it's kind of intuition, or hopefully you make a lot

862
00:56:54,471 --> 00:56:58,593
of the right guesses early on that'll help your game.

863
00:56:58,593 --> 00:57:00,914
And the other thing we do is we actually don't make games.

864
00:57:00,914 --> 00:57:07,017
If we're halfway through the game, you know, the classic story is our dinosaur game.

865
00:57:07,017 --> 00:57:10,779
We tried and tried and tried to make that game, just wasn't working,

866
00:57:10,779 --> 00:57:12,320
and so we didn't end up making it.

867
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:17,022
So, you know, I think it doesn't always work out, and I think you have to be kind

868
00:57:17,022 --> 00:57:18,823
of painfully honest about it.

869
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:23,280
what's happening in your game and be willing to change it up or even have to move on to

870
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:24,541
something else.

871
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:24,861
Okay.

872
00:57:24,861 --> 00:57:25,181
Thanks.

873
00:57:25,181 --> 00:57:25,281
Yes.

874
00:57:25,281 --> 00:57:32,663
When you're making a game that is very long, like several hours for a particular game,

875
00:57:32,663 --> 00:57:35,204
how do you deal with getting fast iteration?

876
00:57:35,204 --> 00:57:41,326
If you're making a change really late in the tech tree or somewhere that you really have

877
00:57:41,326 --> 00:57:46,888
to play through like five hours to even, you know, be able to test if this, not only if

878
00:57:47,442 --> 00:57:50,686
it is a good game design, but if it even works,

879
00:57:50,686 --> 00:57:55,052
how do you set up so that you get a reasonable iteration

880
00:57:55,052 --> 00:57:56,814
time for problems like that?

881
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:00,332
Well, one, you spend a lot of time playing.

882
00:58:00,332 --> 00:58:03,073
I think, when I'm developing, I'm probably spending over half

883
00:58:03,073 --> 00:58:05,314
my time just playing the game and getting

884
00:58:05,314 --> 00:58:06,554
my own personal feedback.

885
00:58:06,554 --> 00:58:09,655
Save games are very useful.

886
00:58:09,655 --> 00:58:13,637
If you can save the game halfway through or 3 quarters of the way

887
00:58:13,637 --> 00:58:15,598
through and pick it up at a later time.

888
00:58:15,598 --> 00:58:18,839
One of the things that we build into our prototypes

889
00:58:18,839 --> 00:58:22,701
is constant auto saves so that we can always go back.

890
00:58:22,701 --> 00:58:25,522
If something happens, we can always go back to a previous

891
00:58:25,522 --> 00:58:25,682
time.

892
00:58:26,207 --> 00:58:28,769
or if we want to try to look at a change

893
00:58:28,769 --> 00:58:30,330
and see how it affects the game,

894
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:33,432
we can find a save where we can kind of get very quickly to that.

895
00:58:33,432 --> 00:58:36,273
So it's kind of about building your methodology

896
00:58:36,273 --> 00:58:38,115
around the idea of rapid prototyping

897
00:58:38,115 --> 00:58:39,235
and that kind of thing.

898
00:58:39,235 --> 00:58:42,577
I think we have time maybe for one more question.

899
00:58:42,577 --> 00:58:44,258
man 2 Oh, okay.

900
00:58:44,258 --> 00:58:47,881
So I was going to ask you a question about,

901
00:58:47,881 --> 00:58:49,121
well, it's not really a trend.

902
00:58:49,121 --> 00:58:50,522
I just noticed more games they've...

903
00:58:50,933 --> 00:58:54,094
decided to try to consolidate actions together so that when

904
00:58:54,094 --> 00:58:57,095
you do one thing it does like two different things at once or

905
00:58:57,095 --> 00:59:00,836
else they try to limit the number of actions you can do per

906
00:59:00,836 --> 00:59:04,537
turn like I think Skulls of the Shogun and Hero of Canary kinda

907
00:59:04,537 --> 00:59:07,918
does that and I was really glad to see that that was actually

908
00:59:07,918 --> 00:59:10,179
one of the things you pointed out in the interesting decision

909
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:14,060
slide so it's I was glad to see that was something that

910
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:20,389
So have you played any, do you know of any games that kind of use that really well?

911
00:59:20,389 --> 00:59:22,111
I think maybe chess might be a good example.

912
00:59:22,111 --> 00:59:23,993
Do you have any other maybe modern games examples?

913
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:31,661
Well, um, I'm not sure it directly ties to what you're, you know, the idea that you're

914
00:59:31,661 --> 00:59:32,943
talking about, but, uh.

915
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:36,899
it's a lot of times it, it is good, we just find it good to

916
00:59:36,899 --> 00:59:38,219
consolidate or simplify.

917
00:59:38,219 --> 00:59:39,760
And there's a couple of examples.

918
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,580
The, the original Civilization had a map that was twice as

919
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:47,921
big and, uh, actually had a secondary tech tree where

920
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:48,881
other things were happening.

921
00:59:48,881 --> 00:59:52,142
And we just found that by taking a lot of those things

922
00:59:52,142 --> 00:59:54,842
out and consolidating them, simplifying the tech tree and

923
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:57,923
things like that, the game, uh, became more interesting.

924
00:59:57,923 --> 00:59:59,803
Because something is interesting to do once,

925
00:59:59,803 --> 01:00:02,723
doesn't mean it's interesting to do ten times.

926
01:00:03,184 --> 01:00:07,046
And I think you have to kind of recognize that as a designer,

927
01:00:07,046 --> 01:00:11,509
that the player is really expecting variety, forward

928
01:00:11,509 --> 01:00:14,491
motion, and the game to progress and change in a way

929
01:00:14,491 --> 01:00:16,673
that's pretty apparent to them.

930
01:00:16,673 --> 01:00:19,695
So you need to make sure that if you've got something that's

931
01:00:19,695 --> 01:00:22,597
cool, it might be cool to do it once, but it might not be

932
01:00:22,597 --> 01:00:23,938
cool to do it six times.

933
01:00:23,938 --> 01:00:25,739
And just kind of recognize those kinds of things.

934
01:00:25,739 --> 01:00:26,679
I think we're out of time.

935
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:28,961
Thank you very much for coming.

936
01:00:28,961 --> 01:00:32,063
I appreciate being able to talk to you.

937
01:00:33,348 --> 01:00:34,894
Make great games.
