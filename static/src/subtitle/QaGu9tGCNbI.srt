00:00:12,628 --> 00:00:19,109
Hello! Thanks for joining me. Welcome to Sparking Curiosity-Driven Exploration Through Narrative

2
00:00:19,329 --> 00:00:25,011
in Outer Wilds. I'm very obviously Kelsey Beecham. I'm a writer and narrative designer,

3
00:00:25,631 --> 00:00:30,772
and I actually started my games career with Outer Wilds, specifically as a contractor

4
00:00:30,812 --> 00:00:31,572
for Mobius Digital.

5
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:35,114
These days, I'm a narrative designer at Obsidian Entertainment.

6
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:39,258
Just a quick mention before we get going here.

7
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:41,940
I don't represent either of those studios.

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,041
My thoughts are my own.

9
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:44,783
Please do not steal them.

10
00:00:44,803 --> 00:00:46,044
I only have so many.

11
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:49,808
So today we're going to be talking specifically about Outer Wilds.

12
00:00:51,105 --> 00:00:54,068
Outer Wilds is a weird little project that happened.

13
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:58,353
Back in 2012, we began as my brother Alex Beachum's

14
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,336
master's thesis at University of Southern California.

15
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:08,385
And in 2013, we were in the university showcase.

16
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:09,486
And then after that point,

17
00:01:09,526 --> 00:01:11,648
we kind of just kept developing it for fun.

18
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:15,868
And then in 2015, some very good stuff happened for us.

19
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:19,751
And we won Seamus McNally at the Independent Games Festival

20
00:01:19,971 --> 00:01:21,192
as well as Best in Design.

21
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,815
And then later that year, we were picked up by Mobius Digital

22
00:01:25,716 --> 00:01:26,977
to continue development.

23
00:01:27,517 --> 00:01:31,020
And then eventually in 2019, we launched.

24
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:35,984
And I bring this up because Outer Wilds, probably

25
00:01:36,044 --> 00:01:38,846
because of its origin as a thesis project,

26
00:01:39,418 --> 00:01:42,099
has some very specific design goals to it,

27
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,041
and some very particular things

28
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:45,421
that we were trying to accomplish.

29
00:01:46,062 --> 00:01:48,943
So what I'd like to do is break down Narrative's role

30
00:01:49,003 --> 00:01:51,225
in supporting Outer Wilds' unique design goals,

31
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,427
and bring up examples of what worked for us and why.

32
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:58,009
And we're gonna have fun.

33
00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:02,331
Before we do though, this talk does contain spoilers.

34
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:03,412
I'm very sorry.

35
00:02:03,432 --> 00:02:05,093
Our fans have a saying

36
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:07,574
that talking about Outer Wilds is spoilers.

37
00:02:08,153 --> 00:02:13,135
They are not wrong. It is impossible to talk about this game without spoiling it at least a little.

38
00:02:13,755 --> 00:02:19,177
So you've been warned. If you are thinking of playing this game, I would recommend like pausing

39
00:02:19,217 --> 00:02:24,359
the video and just coming back to it later after you've finished the game. I'll be here.

40
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:31,682
For the rest of you, Outer Wilds is an open world space exploration game, adventure slash narrative

41
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:36,964
mystery. We're often described as alien NASA meets backpacking in space, which is pretty fun.

42
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,645
And the fun bit about the solar system is that it is caught in a time loop.

43
00:02:41,986 --> 00:02:44,610
And throughout that time loop of 22 minutes,

44
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:50,257
the planets and celestial bodies are changing over time, which affects where you can explore.

45
00:02:50,277 --> 00:02:54,523
You start out as a Hearthian on the planet Timber Heart.

46
00:02:55,053 --> 00:03:00,195
and you're part of this space program and it's your first solo launch. So it's launch day,

47
00:03:00,255 --> 00:03:04,716
that's all fun and exciting. You have to get launch codes from ground control but that's it.

48
00:03:05,336 --> 00:03:09,057
That's the only thing we really make you do. And then from there you're sent off into space

49
00:03:09,237 --> 00:03:15,639
to freely explore the world as you see fit. One thing you are encountering up there is

50
00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:20,940
you're discovering ruins and writing left behind by this ancient alien species called the Nomai.

51
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:24,801
and you're using that to piece together the world's mysteries.

52
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:29,125
After 22 minutes, the sun explodes, killing the player,

53
00:03:29,665 --> 00:03:32,847
and resetting everything to the beginning of that time loop.

54
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:37,510
But at its simplest, Outer Wilds is a game

55
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:39,492
about finding answers to questions

56
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,613
about the world around you.

57
00:03:42,534 --> 00:03:44,876
To that end, let's talk about major design goals

58
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:45,516
really quickly.

59
00:03:47,017 --> 00:03:50,320
So from my brother's thesis paper,

60
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:56,273
Outer Wilds is a space exploration game designed to inspire and reward player curiosity.

61
00:03:56,773 --> 00:03:58,074
Pretty straightforward, allegedly.

62
00:03:58,895 --> 00:04:02,978
The goal here being create a game that rewards curiosity-driven exploration.

63
00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:03,879
Easy enough.

64
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:07,361
So here for us, that means the player is...

65
00:04:08,062 --> 00:04:09,803
They have questions about the world around them.

66
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,405
And they want those questions answered.

67
00:04:12,425 --> 00:04:15,187
So they're taking action to find those answers.

68
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:16,808
A.K.A. exploring.

69
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,371
Basically, it starts with a question.

70
00:04:20,806 --> 00:04:26,888
usually what's there, what is it, what is it like up close, and it drives the player toward discovering an answer.

71
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:30,809
Hopefully an answer they like.

72
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,951
Curiosity is

73
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:39,952
Outer Wilds' driving force, and it is Outer Wilds' sole driving force.

74
00:04:40,632 --> 00:04:45,034
There are no missions, assigned objectives, any kind of prescriptive

75
00:04:45,414 --> 00:04:49,535
guidelines that you have to follow. We're not telling the player what to do.

76
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:52,750
it's entirely self-guided, well, almost entirely.

77
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,451
Knowledge is also kind of the only gameplay reward.

78
00:04:58,192 --> 00:05:00,713
We don't have those other feedback loops

79
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:04,714
of point scoring or, you know,

80
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:06,395
completing something at a set time

81
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:08,336
or anything competitive, multiplayer.

82
00:05:09,296 --> 00:05:11,517
So we really needed our players

83
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:12,898
to like knowledge an awful lot.

84
00:05:13,758 --> 00:05:15,659
Also, knowledge is how you progress in the game.

85
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:18,220
So obviously this is really important for us.

86
00:05:20,103 --> 00:05:22,845
Here's a summary of that, if you needed it.

87
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:26,748
But point being, we're very serious about knowledge

88
00:05:26,768 --> 00:05:27,889
being the big reward here.

89
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,252
And we did realize going in, yeah,

90
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:34,955
that's going to alienate certain player types, specifically

91
00:05:34,995 --> 00:05:35,395
these ones.

92
00:05:36,596 --> 00:05:38,098
But that's OK.

93
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:42,922
Giving everything we had for this very particular type

94
00:05:42,962 --> 00:05:46,344
of player actually let us create this really, really

95
00:05:46,384 --> 00:05:47,966
compelling experience for them.

96
00:05:47,986 --> 00:05:48,846
I hope.

97
00:05:49,152 --> 00:05:51,994
I don't know, I think that was worth embracing.

98
00:05:52,014 --> 00:05:56,897
Okay, okay, so said a lot of good things.

99
00:05:57,217 --> 00:05:59,299
Let's talk about what this actually looks like.

100
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,180
So if our gameplay loop is at its core,

101
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,842
inspiring curiosity and then rewarding the player

102
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:06,463
for acting on that curiosity,

103
00:06:07,464 --> 00:06:08,965
this is what we're kind of looking at here.

104
00:06:09,705 --> 00:06:12,787
And for narrative, my role in that

105
00:06:13,267 --> 00:06:14,668
can be either one of those things.

106
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:19,843
So the player will become curious about something, say, you know, the anglerfish at the museum,

107
00:06:20,703 --> 00:06:25,667
and then hopefully the player acts on their curiosity. And in this case, they're going to

108
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:30,371
walk up, see the anglerfish, read the flag, all that good stuff, and be rewarded with knowledge,

109
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:37,456
which is, hey, it's an anglerfish! And from there, our player is going to hopefully be curious and

110
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:41,899
explore and remember, oh, like Dark Bramble, I saw a baby anglerfish at the museum. Well,

111
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,761
you saw an anglerfish at the museum.

112
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:55,551
I'm sorry about this. This I want to bring up doesn't justify to narrative, because knowledge

113
00:06:55,631 --> 00:07:03,136
does not only come in this game in written form. If you're investigating a cave, the reward here

114
00:07:03,216 --> 00:07:10,301
is of course not that death. It's that knowledge that the cave fills up with sand. You're learning

115
00:07:10,361 --> 00:07:11,562
something about how the cave works.

116
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:17,153
And that's progress, because it's helping us learn how to navigate that cave space.

117
00:07:17,673 --> 00:07:21,454
Now we can travel further inside safely, we can learn what's in there,

118
00:07:22,314 --> 00:07:25,295
where we're also going to discover new things to be curious about.

119
00:07:26,456 --> 00:07:28,656
For example, the Sunless City and all the ruins in there.

120
00:07:29,196 --> 00:07:34,298
So, it's also worth pointing out that the knowledge that we're giving players as a reward

121
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:36,738
is not always the knowledge they were looking for,

122
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:40,039
because presumably you did not run into that cave looking for death.

123
00:07:41,592 --> 00:07:47,397
It's just, it's enough to kind of progress along that path and help us get in the right direction,

124
00:07:47,537 --> 00:07:56,023
even if it's not the answer right away. So I bring all of this up because our main overall

125
00:07:56,063 --> 00:08:01,588
design goals have a huge impact on story. It determines story type and structure,

126
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:04,130
and it also determines what our narrative goals are.

127
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:10,064
So if we want a maximally nonlinear gameplay experience

128
00:08:10,384 --> 00:08:12,465
that inspires curiosity in the player,

129
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:16,245
enables free exploration, and rewards them for exploring,

130
00:08:16,946 --> 00:08:19,306
we're looking at a mystery first off, right?

131
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:22,747
Complex enough to motivate the player for the entire game,

132
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:24,667
because we don't want that to fall apart.

133
00:08:25,207 --> 00:08:27,768
And we want them to be invested in the world and what's happening to it,

134
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:30,208
because without that player investment, why are they playing the game?

135
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:33,769
Free exploration means no gating.

136
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:39,348
It means nothing is off limits, and it means that we don't want a story that is impossible to keep track of,

137
00:08:39,748 --> 00:08:41,449
even though it needs to be complex.

138
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,892
We also want mysteries that pay off regularly with satisfying answers.

139
00:08:48,012 --> 00:08:51,153
We want the overall story itself to be very rewarding,

140
00:08:51,773 --> 00:08:54,775
and we want that story to kind of push players forward,

141
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:59,237
get them to ask, oh, what happens next, and want to learn that.

142
00:09:01,198 --> 00:09:01,578
It's a lot.

143
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:07,056
So we're going to simplify it a little bit.

144
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:12,798
Generally, any narrative design choices we made on the project

145
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:16,239
ultimately falls under one of these kind of three broad goals.

146
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:20,120
Inspire curiosity, facilitate exploration,

147
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:27,083
or reward exploration. Often a narrative designer of story

148
00:09:27,123 --> 00:09:30,304
choice is accomplishing more than one of those goals at the

149
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:31,164
same time, which

150
00:09:31,702 --> 00:09:37,184
Made structuring this talk a little tricky, let me tell you. But let's start with this first one.

151
00:09:39,405 --> 00:09:45,688
So, step one, how do we make the player curious? Write a really good story. That's it. That's the

152
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:55,813
talk. No, I'm sorry. I'm just like this. Basically, Outer Wilds story is a sprawling mystery. Or

153
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,543
It's kind of made up a ton of little mysteries that all kind of add together to make this sprawling mystery.

154
00:10:03,763 --> 00:10:05,564
But we'll talk about structure a little more later.

155
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,606
There's the mystery of what's happening in the solar system.

156
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:12,268
You have planets that are changing, you have the sun exploding,

157
00:10:12,288 --> 00:10:15,110
you're caught in a time loop and we don't know why that's all going on.

158
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,771
And then we also have the mystery of Noma.

159
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:19,312
Who were they? Where did they come from?

160
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:21,013
What were they doing here? What happened to them?

161
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,957
Another way to think of how we make the player curious is just

162
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:29,234
how do we get the player to ask questions?

163
00:10:29,314 --> 00:10:30,755
Because we need them to be doing that.

164
00:10:31,655 --> 00:10:35,237
And that itself means we need to look at

165
00:10:35,317 --> 00:10:37,838
what specific questions we want the player to ask,

166
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:40,679
because that's what's going to guide our player's journey.

167
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,482
We started with four initial major questions

168
00:10:46,742 --> 00:10:48,723
when we were developing story.

169
00:10:48,743 --> 00:10:49,803
And I keep saying we,

170
00:10:50,243 --> 00:10:52,764
and that would be the creative director, Alex Beecham,

171
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,825
and the lead designer, Loan Bruneau.

172
00:10:55,984 --> 00:11:02,669
So we looked at these four major questions, and each one of them is a major storyline or mystery thread in the game.

173
00:11:03,749 --> 00:11:09,853
And a cool thing about this is that early on in the game you'll find content that

174
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:16,037
connects to those mysteries in some way, even if you don't necessarily as the player know that right off the bat.

175
00:11:17,158 --> 00:11:19,520
And what you're going to find with each one of these examples...

176
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:26,069
is they're big exciting events and we're showing them to you rather than telling you about them.

177
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:37,539
For example, the alien statue, the Noah statue in the museum, when you come out to head off into

178
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:43,864
space, actually you get frozen in place temporarily and it turns toward you and its eyes glow and it

179
00:11:43,984 --> 00:11:46,626
activates and it starts syncing up with your memories.

180
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:47,579
That's huge.

181
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:50,440
And that is a really good way for us to pull the player

182
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,740
into the Know My Story, rather than just saying,

183
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,461
hey, here's some text you can read, huh?

184
00:11:57,681 --> 00:11:59,162
Quick pop quiz on that one.

185
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:04,203
Which of these is more exciting as a player experience?

186
00:12:05,363 --> 00:12:08,184
Me telling you that there are cyclones on Giant's Deep?

187
00:12:09,364 --> 00:12:11,264
Pretty cool.

188
00:12:11,484 --> 00:12:11,924
Or this?

189
00:12:11,944 --> 00:12:13,365
Yeah.

190
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:21,658
Basically, it's these physical processes and locations that grab the player's attention

191
00:12:22,358 --> 00:12:26,400
and it's leading them to investigate whatever it is that has grabbed their attention.

192
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:33,703
Usually what happens is, for example, with the cyclones, you get sucked in, quite literally.

193
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:37,064
Boy, I didn't think I was going to make that joke.

194
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:41,241
But you get pulled in and then you're on Giant's Deep

195
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,061
and you're interacting with the ruins there

196
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,383
and the found text, and that sort of gets you

197
00:12:45,403 --> 00:12:47,484
to investigate what's happening on that planet.

198
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:51,706
Some of the story is, in fact, I'd say a lot of that story

199
00:12:51,786 --> 00:12:52,866
is told through found text,

200
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:57,649
but it generally doesn't deliver our biggest initial hooks.

201
00:12:57,949 --> 00:12:59,290
It's meant to be interesting.

202
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,890
It's designed that way, for sure,

203
00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:03,052
but it's not gonna be as exciting

204
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:04,392
as getting sucked up by a cyclone.

205
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:10,801
And when text does deliver a hook, it can only do so when the player chooses to interact with it.

206
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:15,003
I can't push that information onto the player for the most part.

207
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,563
We tend not to do that.

208
00:13:17,244 --> 00:13:18,824
And I'll tell you why.

209
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:20,805
Here is my...

210
00:13:22,346 --> 00:13:22,606
Okay.

211
00:13:23,406 --> 00:13:24,507
Well, not a technical term.

212
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:25,847
But let me talk you through this.

213
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:27,328
Because it's a thing I think about a lot.

214
00:13:27,748 --> 00:13:31,810
And it's the idea of pushing information on the player versus having the player pull it.

215
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,471
I made you a diagram.

216
00:13:35,585 --> 00:13:39,907
It's this thing of imagine that you've gotten out of your car

217
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:42,468
and your arms are full of groceries and they're heavy

218
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:44,568
and your neighbor has come up

219
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:46,409
and wants to tell you all about their day

220
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:48,109
and they're pushing this information

221
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:49,010
about their day on you.

222
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,891
You didn't ask, you don't want it, you're busy.

223
00:13:51,991 --> 00:13:54,191
In fact, there's ice cream in one of those bags

224
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,492
and it's melting probably

225
00:13:55,792 --> 00:13:57,172
and now that's all you can think about.

226
00:13:57,472 --> 00:13:59,793
So you're not really in the ideal headspace

227
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:03,094
to receive that information from your neighbor.

228
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:04,195
Not great.

229
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:12,559
However, once you've put the ice cream inside and it's safely not melting and you've got

230
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:17,241
the rest of the groceries squared away, it's not on your mind anymore, and you go out and

231
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:26,006
then you ask your neighbor for this information, for some reason, then you are in a much better

232
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:29,888
space to receive it and you're going to remember it and be more engaged with it.

233
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:34,971
To that end, because there is a ton of information in Outer Wilds.

234
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,701
we need to be really careful to not overwhelm the player with it.

235
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:49,144
And so to try to mitigate that, what we did was we minimized how often you are forced to receive information

236
00:14:49,944 --> 00:14:53,225
and how much information you are forced to receive that way.

237
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:59,047
A good example of forced information being pushed on the player, cutscenes.

238
00:14:59,527 --> 00:15:01,748
Cutscenes do that. They push that info to you.

239
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:06,084
For us, it's limited to the very start and very end of the game.

240
00:15:06,264 --> 00:15:08,205
The very end of the game because it's kind of linear

241
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:09,866
and we're wrapping things up.

242
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:11,567
It kind of has to at some point be that.

243
00:15:12,308 --> 00:15:13,989
And the very beginning of the game

244
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:17,531
because you do have to talk to the first, I think the first,

245
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:19,632
no, gosh, is it just one?

246
00:15:20,012 --> 00:15:20,593
I should know this.

247
00:15:22,014 --> 00:15:24,075
You do have to talk to at least the curator

248
00:15:24,095 --> 00:15:25,596
because you have to go get the launch codes.

249
00:15:25,776 --> 00:15:28,798
And that does have to happen so that we can then

250
00:15:28,818 --> 00:15:31,659
do that cinematic of the statue turning toward you

251
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,360
and activating.

252
00:15:33,121 --> 00:15:34,041
but it's pretty minimal.

253
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:37,542
So what we do instead here,

254
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:39,702
because we do need the player to know

255
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:42,003
that information is available when they're ready for it,

256
00:15:42,043 --> 00:15:42,963
when they want to seek it out.

257
00:15:43,383 --> 00:15:45,203
So you have to signal its availability.

258
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:52,685
So pixing obviously is determined by player actions.

259
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:55,425
As you're going through finding know my text, for example,

260
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:59,766
that's completely down to the player, almost entirely.

261
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:04,917
Key information is kept infinitely revisitable because we are in a time loop.

262
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:09,379
Even Gabbro, the traveler that is aware of the time loop with you,

263
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,382
even Gabbro, you can still revisit all of those points. So you're never in a position where you

264
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:19,385
think, oh boy, there's information being pushed on me. I have to remember all of this because

265
00:16:19,425 --> 00:16:28,170
if I forget, it's going to be a huge problem. We're also kind of coding how to find

266
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,323
or where to find certain types of information

267
00:16:31,703 --> 00:16:32,923
through narrative delivery.

268
00:16:33,423 --> 00:16:35,484
So really obvious example,

269
00:16:35,504 --> 00:16:37,944
Nomai text will always contain information

270
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:39,224
about the Nomai and their story,

271
00:16:39,284 --> 00:16:41,085
and it's always going to provide clues

272
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:43,425
about unraveling the solar system's mysteries.

273
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:47,346
Unvisited Nomai text is coded such that

274
00:16:48,026 --> 00:16:50,187
if you haven't read it before in that time loop,

275
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:51,427
it's a different color.

276
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:54,428
Found texts about specific mystery threads

277
00:16:54,488 --> 00:16:56,948
are largely grouped kind of by physical location.

278
00:16:57,008 --> 00:16:57,488
So, you know.

279
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:02,433
if it's a small arc at least, you know, kind of to check out the immediate surrounding area for

280
00:17:02,473 --> 00:17:07,175
more information about that. So we're trying to kind of guide the player to know where certain

281
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:10,956
information is so that if they want to pull that information, they know where to do it.

282
00:17:12,237 --> 00:17:17,078
The travelers are a great example of this. There's one on every planet. You can easily

283
00:17:17,139 --> 00:17:20,460
locate them through the stegoscope because they all play an instrument, so you can pick up their

284
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:26,522
sound. And that makes them very easy to find and also kind of delightful. Andrew probably did an

285
00:17:26,582 --> 00:17:27,683
amazing job with the music.

286
00:17:28,687 --> 00:17:30,488
And the menu is what I want to point out here,

287
00:17:30,568 --> 00:17:33,089
because it's set up and it functions the same way

288
00:17:33,249 --> 00:17:34,449
for a lot of our travelers,

289
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:38,250
where you can pull that information about,

290
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,411
hey, I don't know where to go or where to explore

291
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:43,712
on this planet, help me out here.

292
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:47,333
That's really useful for us, for players,

293
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:48,773
that maybe need a little more guidance,

294
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:50,694
especially initially, because this is very

295
00:17:50,754 --> 00:17:52,555
surface level stuff that they talk about.

296
00:17:54,335 --> 00:17:56,716
Here's an example of where I do this in text.

297
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:06,578
Initially, we kind of, what's the word, cut the player loose without too much information about

298
00:18:06,638 --> 00:18:14,084
why they were going into space. We tried a couple iterations of this. And it turns out that not

299
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:18,187
everyone is super comfortable with the idea of there not being a specific mission that you're

300
00:18:18,207 --> 00:18:19,068
meant to accomplish.

301
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:26,604
So, eventually, what we did is we landed on with Hornfels, the curator at the museum,

302
00:18:26,624 --> 00:18:30,666
this is the character that you do have to speak with before you can go into space.

303
00:18:31,446 --> 00:18:37,889
And you are given the option to, these are all on your left are all the player choices,

304
00:18:38,229 --> 00:18:43,991
and if you indicate that maybe you're nervous about starting out or that you're not sure

305
00:18:44,231 --> 00:18:48,053
where you should go, we direct you someplace particular.

306
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,583
Not because we especially want to tell you what to do there either.

307
00:18:52,863 --> 00:18:59,327
There's quite a lot you can do at the moon, but it's gentle and kind.

308
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:02,169
It's a great place for players to get their bearings,

309
00:19:02,229 --> 00:19:04,011
if that's something they feel they need to do first.

310
00:19:05,432 --> 00:19:08,774
It's got a few more tutorials that are, again, entirely optional,

311
00:19:08,834 --> 00:19:10,275
because all of our tutorials are.

312
00:19:11,095 --> 00:19:14,217
You can examine Nozomi ruins while you're stationary,

313
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:17,480
and they're not in 0G, which is a thing we do to people.

314
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:21,239
You're not actively being flung into space. That's nice.

315
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:25,441
So the No Eye Ruins here are also actually a really good entry point for

316
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:28,302
something called the Eye of the Universe, which is a huge thing in our game.

317
00:19:29,662 --> 00:19:33,503
So like that's a good place to guide players to in general, but

318
00:19:33,543 --> 00:19:35,444
again we're not guiding them there unless they

319
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:41,746
indicate that that's what they want. I don't have an official metric for

320
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:44,787
this, but I would say for me watching playtesting, the average time

321
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,781
players take to really interact with Nomai text probably is anywhere from 20-30 minutes

322
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:56,842
to a few hours. Which is kind of wild, but I get it because, you know, there are all

323
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,822
these cool things going on, all these visually interesting things in space that you want

324
00:20:00,842 --> 00:20:05,843
to check out first. So we don't force the players to care about the story. The story

325
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:10,084
can wait until the player is good and ready. You're essentially playing an archaeologist.

326
00:20:10,384 --> 00:20:12,965
It's not going anywhere. It's all in the past.

327
00:20:14,438 --> 00:20:17,698
But I do want players to care about the story eventually.

328
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:21,239
And that's where getting the player invested in it comes in.

329
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:24,160
There's a lot of found text in Outer Wilds,

330
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,580
and we needed players to read it.

331
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,961
Because again, that's how progression works.

332
00:20:29,841 --> 00:20:31,881
And since you're doing so much reading of it,

333
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:33,201
it should also be fun.

334
00:20:34,062 --> 00:20:36,002
So I want it to be an enjoyable experience,

335
00:20:36,502 --> 00:20:38,442
and I want it to be something that they're

336
00:20:38,462 --> 00:20:39,963
willing to get invested in and care about.

337
00:20:39,983 --> 00:20:44,243
So to that end, we'll talk about the Nomai for a minute here.

338
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:50,151
um, if you're not familiar with them. There are these super curious, highly advanced science

339
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:54,793
nerds who used to live in the solar system, and they vanished a long time ago, so that you can

340
00:20:54,833 --> 00:21:01,255
only find their ruins in their writing now. And the challenge of the Nomai for storytelling is

341
00:21:01,315 --> 00:21:08,618
that, uh, they're in the past. They're long gone, meaning we never see them. It is hard to get a

342
00:21:08,678 --> 00:21:14,100
player to care about a character that they never see. Sometimes they might as well not exist.

343
00:21:15,863 --> 00:21:19,745
the player also can't change or impact the past.

344
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:23,407
They can't affect the Nomai story or change what happened to them.

345
00:21:24,027 --> 00:21:24,467
So that's...

346
00:21:26,928 --> 00:21:31,210
It can be a bit tricky then to get players to understand why they even should care.

347
00:21:32,071 --> 00:21:33,851
And yet, they do need to.

348
00:21:35,652 --> 00:21:41,875
So, one thing that took a lot of iteration here was the Nomai voice,

349
00:21:41,955 --> 00:21:43,416
but this was huge because...

350
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:51,790
this is what you're with for so much of the game. Honestly, I spent probably multiple years getting

351
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:57,515
it right. And in fairness, this was back when I was either moonlighting as a game writer or was

352
00:21:57,555 --> 00:22:04,421
very part-time on it. So maybe it's not years of full-time work. But still, this was a lot of

353
00:22:04,481 --> 00:22:10,927
iteration. And it was really worth getting right. A couple of things that I want to note about it.

354
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,959
because they do, you know, might fall into a little bit of the ancient alien trope.

355
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,560
And we did not want them to feel,

356
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,661
I'm not going to name drop the Chozo, but I'm actually exactly going to name

357
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:24,402
drop the Chozo, as much as much as I love Metroid Prime and all.

358
00:22:24,982 --> 00:22:29,903
And the we thing, the hive mind, the.

359
00:22:31,764 --> 00:22:34,865
Those pronouns are so difficult to connect with,

360
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:37,005
it is hard to connect with a group in that way.

361
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:40,075
I is just inherently more interesting.

362
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:41,416
It feels less like a summary.

363
00:22:41,436 --> 00:22:43,837
It's also a little clearer that they're talking to

364
00:22:43,937 --> 00:22:46,699
other characters versus with we,

365
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:48,881
it's like, well, who are you leaving this for?

366
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:51,463
Did you know I was coming to explore later?

367
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:54,465
That'd be weird. Another thing is we

368
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:56,366
wanted it to be unique from the Hearthian voice

369
00:22:56,927 --> 00:23:00,950
because the Hearthians sound a little bit more like

370
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,933
your average humans and we wanted the Nomai to feel a bit alien,

371
00:23:05,313 --> 00:23:06,614
but still be somebody.

372
00:23:07,536 --> 00:23:13,261
or some buddies that you can empathize with and connect with. So that meant watching out for it

373
00:23:13,321 --> 00:23:20,967
feeling stilted or overly formal, which is very easy to run into with that. The use of humor

374
00:23:21,227 --> 00:23:25,390
ended up being huge for us and that was another thing that took some time to get the right feel

375
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:31,315
for. Eventually I settled. They're nerds, they make nerd jokes.

376
00:23:33,022 --> 00:23:37,023
they're making bad jokes in space as they're dealing with all of these complex problems,

377
00:23:37,043 --> 00:23:39,324
and it humanizes them in a really nice way.

378
00:23:39,344 --> 00:23:43,766
Because even if you're not understanding maybe like what they do about quantum,

379
00:23:44,146 --> 00:23:48,067
macroscopic quantum mechanics, or the intricacies of time travel,

380
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:53,069
you're able to identify them with them in these other ways.

381
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:55,169
So that was extremely useful.

382
00:23:58,291 --> 00:23:59,251
It's emotional investing.

383
00:24:00,996 --> 00:24:05,337
Characters, again, because I talked about this a bit, but the whole I versus we thing.

384
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:14,759
Because the player does spend so much time with the Nomai through reading their text and reading

385
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:21,321
their stories, that really they should be, you know, characters that the player wants to spend

386
00:24:21,361 --> 00:24:30,123
time with. Humanizing them to feel more relatable and more interesting just makes them so much more

387
00:24:31,141 --> 00:24:36,283
alive. And again, we're doing this and you're not seeing them, so they have to be alive as

388
00:24:36,323 --> 00:24:41,525
much as possible. It's also, it's a lot easier to connect to individuals than a big group,

389
00:24:41,545 --> 00:24:47,067
because a big group is kind of nebulous and a little harder to define. And an individual,

390
00:24:47,127 --> 00:24:52,449
I can describe, you know, a nomized personality and like what they want specifically or don't want,

391
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:58,151
what their hopes or fears are, harder to do with a group because it's just that much broader.

392
00:24:59,317 --> 00:25:06,064
Individuals are also nice because they give us greater variance in terms of content and in terms

393
00:25:06,124 --> 00:25:10,828
of voice. They have different, you know, senses of humor. They have different personalities.

394
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:16,553
That ended up being really useful for keeping content consistently interesting and different.

395
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:21,658
But basically, characters get us invested, and we want to see what happens to them.

396
00:25:21,918 --> 00:25:25,202
And that's exactly the thing that I need to have happen for the player.

397
00:25:27,493 --> 00:25:31,496
There's another way that we persuade players to take an interest in the Know My Story,

398
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:35,799
and that is how the player learns that story.

399
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:40,182
Specifically, it's the translator tool, which is a thing I freaking love!

400
00:25:41,943 --> 00:25:45,685
It's this really nice example of gameplay and narrative design just integrating really

401
00:25:45,725 --> 00:25:46,285
well together.

402
00:25:47,026 --> 00:25:53,750
And it happened because Alex wanted to know, hey, what if you could physically interact

403
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,691
with the text, Kelsey?

404
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,371
Do you think that would change it for you?

405
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,751
Yes, and I'll show you how,

406
00:26:01,771 --> 00:26:03,992
but it's a little easier to do with the video.

407
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:15,834
So purple text hasn't been translated yet.

408
00:26:17,134 --> 00:26:18,675
You're holding a button to translate it.

409
00:26:20,735 --> 00:26:22,075
And you'll notice that it's branching off

410
00:26:22,115 --> 00:26:24,076
in two directions here because it's nonlinear.

411
00:26:32,812 --> 00:26:35,676
this gives the player just a little bit more control

412
00:26:35,756 --> 00:26:37,078
over the text than they would have

413
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:38,339
if it were written linearly,

414
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,422
which is kind of nice in a game like this.

415
00:27:01,735 --> 00:27:04,677
So obviously, no-line text exists physically in the world.

416
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:12,884
The translator tool is so fun because it is allowing the player to engage with the text

417
00:27:13,684 --> 00:27:17,307
in a way that's maybe a little more exciting than, you know, walking up to it, pressing A.

418
00:27:17,988 --> 00:27:23,633
And it turns text delivery into a game mechanic, which I'm a huge nerd about.

419
00:27:25,424 --> 00:27:30,186
So I also got to play with language a bit as a result because we're presenting text differently

420
00:27:30,246 --> 00:27:36,289
than we maybe normally would, say like with the way we do with the Hearthians. And so language

421
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:41,331
as a result is structured non-linearly. It comes from actually the way that I take notes usually,

422
00:27:41,372 --> 00:27:47,294
which is just a branch off consistently and loop back around other points. Typically with this

423
00:27:47,354 --> 00:27:51,356
text, because we've talked a little bit about coding for particular information, we want the

424
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:53,557
longest branch to contain the most important info.

425
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,891
It's not always the case.

426
00:27:54,931 --> 00:27:56,451
It's just kind of a loose rule of thumb.

427
00:27:56,991 --> 00:27:59,572
And then usually it's branch endings

428
00:27:59,652 --> 00:28:00,652
or occasionally beginnings.

429
00:28:01,052 --> 00:28:03,933
Those are often going to contain kind of your actionable clue

430
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,294
of what's going on, where to go next, that sort of thing.

431
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:10,234
Not always, just ish.

432
00:28:12,295 --> 00:28:15,215
This is a very, very basic example of it

433
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,756
because I didn't want to pull anything too crazy,

434
00:28:17,176 --> 00:28:18,576
but you can see the way it branches off

435
00:28:18,616 --> 00:28:19,737
based off of topic there.

436
00:28:20,697 --> 00:28:25,259
So that brings us to our second narrative design goal, which is facilitating exploration.

437
00:28:27,259 --> 00:28:33,962
Here's a weird thing. I wrote Outer Wilds in-game text to fulfill highly specific design needs,

438
00:28:34,502 --> 00:28:40,884
and obviously to support non-linear progression. Every piece of text in the game, well, every

439
00:28:40,904 --> 00:28:47,406
piece of Nomai text in the game, either communicates a clue, sets up a piece of world lore,

440
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,467
or builds on themes and characterization.

441
00:28:50,188 --> 00:28:55,029
Usually it's all three at once, and it's always this one,

442
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:59,571
except for like a handful of flavor text that I wrote.

443
00:29:00,351 --> 00:29:02,772
We really didn't have a lot of space for that.

444
00:29:02,832 --> 00:29:05,993
So almost no text in the game is like purely for fun.

445
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:08,614
Here's how this is gonna work.

446
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:13,355
So we have to advance story, right?

447
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:17,137
We have to advance plot, character, story arcs,

448
00:29:17,717 --> 00:29:18,897
mysteries, that sort of thing.

449
00:29:19,815 --> 00:29:25,619
And we also need to direct the player forward to where to go to continue following that story

450
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:29,641
thread or get more information about it. But since we don't know when the player is hitting

451
00:29:29,661 --> 00:29:34,945
this piece of information, we need to also direct them to previously in the story thread. Or

452
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:41,308
sometimes it's just to kind of the previous story arc that would have tied into this one.

453
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:47,592
Again, everything's really interconnected. So if we take that piece of text that I had up earlier,

454
00:29:47,612 --> 00:29:49,393
and we break it down into

455
00:29:50,084 --> 00:29:55,147
by this kind of system, this is what we end up getting.

456
00:29:56,988 --> 00:29:59,029
It's a fairly, again, a fairly basic example,

457
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,069
not my favorite bit of writing,

458
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,111
but it does do a good job of explaining it,

459
00:30:02,571 --> 00:30:03,471
what I am getting at.

460
00:30:04,372 --> 00:30:07,114
However, because I don't want my colorblind friends

461
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:09,575
to hate me, we're gonna break this down by section

462
00:30:10,135 --> 00:30:11,236
so that you can tell what's bolded.

463
00:30:12,597 --> 00:30:16,419
So here is just everything in bold and color is,

464
00:30:16,908 --> 00:30:22,709
a story thread being advanced. In this particular case, you know, the story of what eventually

465
00:30:22,749 --> 00:30:28,330
leads to the creation of the time loop device, which is a major mystery in the game. There

466
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,071
are those individual personalities coming into play a bit with Pi and Raimi, who have

467
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:37,532
kind of a friendly rivalry going on. There's also some humor in that hint where they're

468
00:30:37,552 --> 00:30:41,493
talking about the door needing to be closed for some time. Haha, do you get it?

469
00:30:46,152 --> 00:30:47,193
I did this to people.

470
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:52,358
So again, and also with the rivalry,

471
00:30:52,478 --> 00:30:54,159
the idea is that it's supposed to be a little bit more fun

472
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:55,941
than just like, hey, we ran an experiment.

473
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,042
That is kind of dry in fairness.

474
00:31:00,805 --> 00:31:02,967
And it's connecting us to kind of,

475
00:31:04,248 --> 00:31:05,649
we're connecting this research

476
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:07,050
that they were running the experiment on

477
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,652
to the Ash Twin Project,

478
00:31:09,712 --> 00:31:11,794
which is kind of the name for the construction

479
00:31:11,814 --> 00:31:13,656
of the time loop device, that sort of thing.

480
00:31:15,033 --> 00:31:16,894
Here's where you would go previously.

481
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:19,416
If you wanted to go back

482
00:31:20,256 --> 00:31:22,338
and figure out what led up to this point,

483
00:31:22,518 --> 00:31:23,959
there are those extraordinary findings

484
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:25,760
and you'll note that we're specifically calling out

485
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,381
where you would find those in the world.

486
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:31,213
so you know to go to the White Hole Station, which is a very specific location in the game.

487
00:31:32,574 --> 00:31:36,838
And then we have where you would go next to continue advancing this plot.

488
00:31:38,219 --> 00:31:41,482
Currently can only be accessed from the path from the Sunless City.

489
00:31:41,982 --> 00:31:48,267
And we are kind of an exception here to the longest branch being the one where it kind of

490
00:31:48,288 --> 00:31:53,272
has most important information. So to kind of mitigate that, I've just gone ahead and

491
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:55,934
put this information in both branches in this particular case.

492
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,913
Progression in Outer Wilds admittedly is challenging. It's not impossible, but it is challenging.

493
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:09,296
That last example perhaps notwithstanding, since it was very clear about where to go.

494
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:15,760
We rely a lot on inference. Once the player has gathered this information, it's up to them to

495
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,682
kind of piece it together and understand what it means in the greater context of the world.

496
00:32:21,183 --> 00:32:23,884
We're really not big believers in spelling it out for players.

497
00:32:24,248 --> 00:32:28,552
But at the same time, we do need it to be clear enough that the player is able to progress.

498
00:32:30,434 --> 00:32:35,279
And it kind of boils down to keeping track of what they've learned should not be the

499
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:38,182
challenging part of piecing the story together.

500
00:32:38,202 --> 00:32:39,163
To that end...

501
00:32:39,654 --> 00:32:42,195
That's why we have the ship computer work the way it does.

502
00:32:42,636 --> 00:32:46,498
That was almost entirely Alex and Loan, so I can't speak too much about it.

503
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:53,564
But what it's doing actually is, whenever I wrote a piece of Nomite text,

504
00:32:53,644 --> 00:32:58,427
I was working from what we had decided that piece of text needed to convey,

505
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:01,149
that absolute most basic piece of information.

506
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:04,532
And that's what we've actually essentially put in the ship log each time.

507
00:33:05,232 --> 00:33:06,913
Entries are only ever

508
00:33:08,214 --> 00:33:13,456
what we're 100% certain the player knows from reading that text.

509
00:33:13,496 --> 00:33:14,797
And that can be really tricky,

510
00:33:14,817 --> 00:33:18,778
because it's easy to slip into assuming what the player knows.

511
00:33:19,418 --> 00:33:23,220
It helps when I was writing it to remember that, for all I know,

512
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,620
this is the first piece of text the player has ever found.

513
00:33:25,941 --> 00:33:28,922
So you can't make any leaps of logic with it, no inferences.

514
00:33:28,982 --> 00:33:31,303
It's just if I look at this piece of text,

515
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:32,843
I 100% know the player knows.

516
00:33:34,698 --> 00:33:38,039
this at bare minimum, and that's what we're putting in the ship log.

517
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,861
So for narrative, you've probably heard of the whole string of pearls thing,

518
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:50,142
or the idea that you're kind of getting X amount of information, and then we're hitting a point

519
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:54,883
where we're saying, okay, we funneled down, and now we can definitively say that the player knows

520
00:33:55,043 --> 00:33:59,825
this much by this point in the story. We cannot do that for Outer Wilds.

521
00:34:00,365 --> 00:34:02,805
Oh, we are a very tangled story structure, my friend.

522
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,941
And we had to assume that the player knows any amount

523
00:34:07,141 --> 00:34:10,962
and any combination of information at any given time.

524
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:13,703
And zero gating means no funnel points.

525
00:34:14,183 --> 00:34:18,224
So I can't check to make sure you've know XYZ

526
00:34:18,544 --> 00:34:21,625
because again, you have free reign in the world.

527
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:24,746
We're not, you know, unlocking locations later on.

528
00:34:24,866 --> 00:34:26,307
It's all there from the get-go.

529
00:34:27,227 --> 00:34:28,927
And it would not be practical

530
00:34:30,828 --> 00:34:32,988
to account for every possible path.

531
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:38,952
that you could take through the Nomai found text and then tailor all of those paths accordingly

532
00:34:38,992 --> 00:34:43,535
to make sure that they're a good player experience, that is the path to madness.

533
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:52,339
I don't want to go there. Basically, the minimum amount of information the player has at any given

534
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:58,723
time when encountering that piece of Nomai text could be as little as just what they've encountered

535
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:02,445
on the path to get up into space, which is very, very little.

536
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:08,121
all the way up until they might have seen literally everything in the game by now, except

537
00:35:08,581 --> 00:35:16,584
the very end. And there is a lot of space in between those areas. That's actually why

538
00:35:17,104 --> 00:35:24,267
having those smaller chunked storylines or character arcs, that sort of thing, that's

539
00:35:24,347 --> 00:35:29,289
why that's so important. Especially the more contained ones, like those localized to a

540
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:31,710
very specific location on, say, a planet.

541
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:37,227
Those, one, tell a specific story in an area.

542
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:38,648
You're getting kind of that payoff,

543
00:35:38,688 --> 00:35:39,908
that structure happening.

544
00:35:40,229 --> 00:35:42,690
So you're getting a satisfying little mini experience there.

545
00:35:43,471 --> 00:35:45,252
But also what you're learning overall

546
00:35:45,272 --> 00:35:46,573
from that particular arc,

547
00:35:46,753 --> 00:35:50,595
that can build on other separate arcs in the game.

548
00:35:51,636 --> 00:35:54,538
So that regardless of the order in which they're encountered,

549
00:35:55,979 --> 00:35:57,039
it's still going to produce

550
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:59,541
a reliably satisfying player experience.

551
00:36:00,261 --> 00:36:00,601
And it's...

552
00:36:01,098 --> 00:36:05,439
tricky to do, part of it is that we're not repeating a lot of information.

553
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:09,380
And we can get away with that because of the time loop,

554
00:36:09,721 --> 00:36:14,182
because essentially you will never ever only be able to receive

555
00:36:14,322 --> 00:36:16,383
a specific piece of information just the once.

556
00:36:18,803 --> 00:36:22,225
So, for example, if we're looking at the escape pods,

557
00:36:22,405 --> 00:36:26,886
there are three escape pods that launched when the Nomai vessel crashed

558
00:36:27,806 --> 00:36:28,687
in the solar system.

559
00:36:29,235 --> 00:36:31,695
And each of them is their own self-contained arc.

560
00:36:32,936 --> 00:36:35,737
Self-contained is maybe not quite the right word to use here

561
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,137
for how interconnected everything is.

562
00:36:37,177 --> 00:36:39,938
But there is a story from when it crashes to kind of

563
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:44,619
when they either find their long-term,

564
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:47,360
or found their long-term settlement,

565
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,821
or else die in dark bramble.

566
00:36:51,149 --> 00:36:53,932
But they're related to one another, but they're all their own arc.

567
00:36:54,332 --> 00:36:57,995
They're related to one another because they're all part of the vessel's arrival arc.

568
00:36:58,536 --> 00:37:01,479
And then there's some text there in the vessel itself, for example,

569
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,063
where the vessel warped into dark ramble accidentally

570
00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:08,705
because it's an interdimensional nightmare.

571
00:37:10,046 --> 00:37:12,849
And then from that, you can also look at...

572
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,582
escape pods one and two, because those are the the nomi that survived in the long run,

573
00:37:17,942 --> 00:37:23,606
those are the first nomi settlers in our solar system that are there long term, and they do

574
00:37:23,646 --> 00:37:29,349
eventually unite, and that's its own separate arc that those smaller arcs are part of. And then on

575
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:35,413
top of that, they all relate because they're all how the nomi arrived in the solar system. And this

576
00:37:35,473 --> 00:37:41,697
is just a very small piece of the mystery that we're talking about here. It's all arcs all the

577
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:42,177
way down.

578
00:37:42,564 --> 00:37:44,565
and you're looking at these very small pieces

579
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:47,205
that you kind of then build up into these bigger things.

580
00:37:47,325 --> 00:37:50,906
And as you can see, some things are part of one arc

581
00:37:50,966 --> 00:37:51,906
but not part of another.

582
00:37:51,926 --> 00:37:54,527
It gets complicated in there,

583
00:37:55,107 --> 00:37:57,328
which is again a hell of a lot of fun

584
00:37:57,388 --> 00:38:00,349
if you're a narrative designer.

585
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:03,289
Genuinely, it was a blast to make.

586
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:04,670
However.

587
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:09,662
in spite of all of my best efforts, there are still some paths through Outer Wilds that do

588
00:38:09,702 --> 00:38:14,426
produce a more satisfying experience than others, and we want to design for that because we want as

589
00:38:14,506 --> 00:38:21,811
many people to get that better experience as possible. So we have these levels of content

590
00:38:21,831 --> 00:38:28,316
that exist. They're roughly divided into three levels. It's not a hard and fast rule, but

591
00:38:28,376 --> 00:38:34,280
essentially any piece of found text in the game falls into one of these three categories more or

592
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:34,440
less.

593
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:40,583
And I'd like to break those levels down because they have a lot to do with physical placement of text.

594
00:38:41,563 --> 00:38:44,524
Surface-level text is going to be the easiest to encounter.

595
00:38:44,544 --> 00:38:50,185
It's often literally on the surface of your planets, your celestial bodies, that sort of thing.

596
00:38:51,606 --> 00:38:58,008
They're usually great for helping a player pick up a story thread and following it with fairly minimal effort.

597
00:38:59,352 --> 00:39:01,753
It's not necessarily the beginning of a mystery,

598
00:39:01,793 --> 00:39:02,974
it's usually in media res,

599
00:39:03,435 --> 00:39:06,297
but you don't need a ton of specialized information

600
00:39:06,337 --> 00:39:07,878
to really understand what's happening.

601
00:39:07,938 --> 00:39:10,360
It's not necessarily introducing crazy new terms,

602
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,060
that sort of thing.

603
00:39:13,062 --> 00:39:15,784
It can be, and often is, ignored by the player

604
00:39:16,424 --> 00:39:19,527
in favor of literally any piece of surface level text

605
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:20,888
that they find more interesting.

606
00:39:21,768 --> 00:39:24,350
And that is something we want to have happen.

607
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,212
If they bounce off of it, that's fine.

608
00:39:26,562 --> 00:39:29,683
We just, we want some of these surface level pieces of text

609
00:39:29,863 --> 00:39:31,303
to make the player curious enough

610
00:39:31,383 --> 00:39:33,944
that they want to pursue that, at least initially.

611
00:39:34,965 --> 00:39:36,905
If we're looking at examples specifically

612
00:39:36,945 --> 00:39:39,106
on the hourglass twins, that piece of text

613
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:40,567
that I broke down earlier

614
00:39:40,607 --> 00:39:42,107
about getting into the high energy lab,

615
00:39:42,587 --> 00:39:45,048
that's a really good example of surface level text.

616
00:39:45,428 --> 00:39:47,769
It's not super hard to parse.

617
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,610
It's pretty clear what it's talking about.

618
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:54,232
It's very clear how to kind of get to that point

619
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:54,812
from earlier.

620
00:39:56,454 --> 00:40:00,997
And it's interesting because we're talking about, you know, some really exciting findings and then

621
00:40:01,037 --> 00:40:04,959
it's led to this project being developed. So it's a pretty good entry point for a lot of

622
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:12,564
that time loop related content. Mid-level text you're going to largely find by following clues.

623
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:17,127
You're a lot less likely to stumble across it. That doesn't mean it's impossible, and it's

624
00:40:17,187 --> 00:40:22,830
actually totally fine if players do come across that without following clues to get to that point.

625
00:40:23,894 --> 00:40:27,115
This is the stuff that's developing our story further.

626
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:29,396
We're getting into some of the more complex details.

627
00:40:29,756 --> 00:40:31,897
We're maybe connecting to other mysteries as well.

628
00:40:33,418 --> 00:40:35,759
But the big thing here is that we're furthering it.

629
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:38,360
We're telling the player kind of where to go to learn more.

630
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,222
We're really rewarding exploration at this point.

631
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,382
The Sunless City has some content like this, even though maybe that's a little lighter.

632
00:40:47,762 --> 00:40:50,243
The mid-level text range is pretty broad in fairness.

633
00:40:51,504 --> 00:40:57,566
So it's not too hard to get into the Sunless City, and so the level of payoff that you're

634
00:40:57,586 --> 00:41:04,088
getting is not too great just yet. And then we have hidden text.

635
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:08,030
Now, this is the text where you need to follow clues to get to this point,

636
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:12,471
and it is extremely unlikely to find hidden level text by accident.

637
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,081
It's often in a difficult to reach location is why.

638
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:22,263
If you think back to even say from the start of the talk,

639
00:41:22,323 --> 00:41:25,224
that example about going into caves and running into sand,

640
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:28,185
you have to learn a fair bit about the environment by this point.

641
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:33,467
You also have to put some different nomi clues together to get here.

642
00:41:35,187 --> 00:41:38,128
You need specific info basically to be able to reach this stuff.

643
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:42,410
And that is because it reveals very valuable stuff.

644
00:41:42,894 --> 00:41:50,738
about the game's mysteries. Answers to mysteries or big conclusions to stories are always at this

645
00:41:50,818 --> 00:41:56,422
level because we want players to hopefully encounter that after they've kind of built up

646
00:41:56,462 --> 00:42:02,446
to that moment. And if you'd like to ask me how we knew which areas were hidden or hard to find,

647
00:42:02,906 --> 00:42:08,769
playtesting. We played the game ourselves. Some places are just inherently harder to get to,

648
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,171
and then we playtested the crap out of it.

649
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:14,678
Good example, there's a big secret in the center of Ashtwin.

650
00:42:15,018 --> 00:42:18,680
Wink. So if you know what that one is,

651
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,123
that's the level of intense we're talking about.

652
00:42:24,904 --> 00:42:27,926
This does mean that technically, yes,

653
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,688
a first-time player can beat the game in a single time loop.

654
00:42:31,428 --> 00:42:33,350
I've never seen it happen,

655
00:42:35,591 --> 00:42:38,493
but it's theoretically not impossible.

656
00:42:39,283 --> 00:42:42,604
I'm not willing to say it's impossible because then someone will prove me wrong.

657
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,104
It's just extremely unlikely.

658
00:42:45,964 --> 00:42:50,225
Basically, all of this design is in place to make sure that that doesn't happen.

659
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:52,266
We did test a lot for it.

660
00:42:52,286 --> 00:42:54,626
I'm not kidding when I said we did a lot of play testing.

661
00:42:54,666 --> 00:42:56,807
We had to, to make sure the game could be pieced

662
00:42:56,847 --> 00:42:59,627
together by the player as they go through it.

663
00:42:59,847 --> 00:43:01,968
All that found text, all putting all the mysteries together.

664
00:43:01,988 --> 00:43:05,649
I think the player would honestly have to have

665
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:07,809
some advanced knowledge or context.

666
00:43:08,312 --> 00:43:12,074
about the game, because even if they did do the specific things

667
00:43:12,114 --> 00:43:15,256
you'd have to do on the first loop to end the game on that

668
00:43:15,296 --> 00:43:18,398
first loop, I don't know that they would have the context

669
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:26,323
necessary to apply that information. But again, will it

670
00:43:26,343 --> 00:43:32,807
be proven wrong? However, we do have this last design goal to go

671
00:43:32,847 --> 00:43:36,129
through. So let's do that. It's rewarding exploration, as you

672
00:43:36,149 --> 00:43:36,549
can tell.

673
00:43:37,873 --> 00:43:44,597
Basically, because again, our big reward in the game is knowledge. Hopefully the reward is also,

674
00:43:44,657 --> 00:43:48,800
you know, the experience and the journey and the satisfaction of a job well done.

675
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:55,404
But in the more classic sense, perhaps it's knowledge. And the problem is that if the

676
00:43:55,444 --> 00:44:00,166
player starts feeling like their efforts are wasted, or they're not getting satisfying results,

677
00:44:00,347 --> 00:44:02,268
or even if just they're not getting

678
00:44:02,841 --> 00:44:09,483
the answers that they want. If they're pursuing a particular mystery thread and we're giving them

679
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:15,245
answers about this other thing, that loop breaks down and I don't have to tell you why that's a

680
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:23,007
problem. So story becomes really useful for rewarding exploration in this way. The inclusion

681
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:28,568
of smaller arcs are huge because the bigger mysteries and questions in the game, they take

682
00:44:28,588 --> 00:44:30,509
a lot of time to answer. Literally...

683
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:39,828
up to the entire game. So we have to reward progress as it happens. Also those smaller

684
00:44:39,908 --> 00:44:48,794
arcs kind of building up to a point, that helps us because if you, you know, if you play through

685
00:44:49,454 --> 00:44:54,077
the first escape pod arc and you know all of that content and then you play the second,

686
00:44:54,178 --> 00:45:00,222
it doesn't ruin the second arc and vice versa. So those smaller arcs also help us in ensuring that

687
00:45:00,605 --> 00:45:02,886
there are still rewards to those mysteries

688
00:45:02,926 --> 00:45:05,407
and we're not spoiling things by going out of order.

689
00:45:05,607 --> 00:45:07,908
Because again, there's just not a set order.

690
00:45:09,089 --> 00:45:13,710
Mixing in lighthearted or sillier or smaller stories

691
00:45:13,831 --> 00:45:15,751
with the massively devastating ones,

692
00:45:16,031 --> 00:45:17,532
because there are some terrible things

693
00:45:17,572 --> 00:45:21,013
that happened to the Nomai, that was big.

694
00:45:21,313 --> 00:45:24,455
Managing that tone was really important in writing.

695
00:45:25,935 --> 00:45:27,436
Because Alex is...

696
00:45:28,371 --> 00:45:36,858
just how he's has been super into science. He has, the game always had this idea that

697
00:45:38,179 --> 00:45:44,844
failure perhaps isn't failure, so to speak. And what I actually mean by that is the idea that,

698
00:45:44,864 --> 00:45:49,708
say, your hypothesis is wrong. That's not failure, it's just that you've now learned information.

699
00:45:50,085 --> 00:45:52,366
that you can apply toward finding the correct hypothesis.

700
00:45:53,786 --> 00:45:58,248
So the Nomai's cultural attitudes very much reflect that. It was just kind of a

701
00:45:58,328 --> 00:46:02,149
natural jumping off point and I think it does help reinforce the

702
00:46:02,189 --> 00:46:05,890
idea for the player of failure in the game as progression.

703
00:46:06,551 --> 00:46:10,252
Failure in this case being death. When the player dies a lot of the time

704
00:46:10,272 --> 00:46:13,213
they might be doing that in the pursuit of knowledge or they're going to learn

705
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:16,274
something from that death even if it's just put your spacesuit on

706
00:46:16,294 --> 00:46:19,075
before you go outside of the ship. We've all been there.

707
00:46:20,946 --> 00:46:23,807
We also have those emotional hooks and payoffs we talked about earlier.

708
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:26,708
And this is where all of that character work really comes into play.

709
00:46:28,189 --> 00:46:31,570
While the player reward for discovering new text is always new information,

710
00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:34,351
you will always get new information as you get new Nomai text.

711
00:46:35,651 --> 00:46:39,733
I was also at the same time trying to pay off some

712
00:46:40,218 --> 00:46:45,781
character arcs and some minor story arcs that maybe weren't related to the massive stakes

713
00:46:45,941 --> 00:46:48,342
of the grander solar system mysteries.

714
00:46:49,303 --> 00:46:54,605
Some examples of that, there's a character called Poke that is afraid that she won't

715
00:46:54,665 --> 00:47:00,168
be able to successfully recreate this work core, and you find that out even though she's

716
00:47:00,188 --> 00:47:02,029
been acting quite confident about it the whole time.

717
00:47:02,249 --> 00:47:04,350
And eventually it leads to her pulling it off.

718
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:07,442
and that's a really good moment for her,

719
00:47:07,602 --> 00:47:09,302
and if I've done my job correctly,

720
00:47:09,382 --> 00:47:11,383
it's a good moment for the player

721
00:47:11,423 --> 00:47:12,983
experiencing that alongside her.

722
00:47:14,563 --> 00:47:16,064
Clary and Yarrow are two characters

723
00:47:16,144 --> 00:47:17,864
that have an interest in each other initially,

724
00:47:17,884 --> 00:47:20,205
and there's some teasing by, I think,

725
00:47:20,245 --> 00:47:22,485
Poke in particular teases Clary about this,

726
00:47:22,525 --> 00:47:23,825
because they're siblings, of course they do.

727
00:47:25,626 --> 00:47:26,586
They have an interest in each other,

728
00:47:26,646 --> 00:47:28,186
and then Clary and Yarrow start dating,

729
00:47:28,266 --> 00:47:29,367
and that's kind of a, you know,

730
00:47:29,427 --> 00:47:30,567
it's a nice payoff, it's sweet.

731
00:47:30,947 --> 00:47:33,228
It's not earth-shattering, but it's nice to see.

732
00:47:33,388 --> 00:47:34,088
We all love to see it.

733
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:38,953
Solanum as a child, you can kind of chart her growth.

734
00:47:40,153 --> 00:47:42,535
You can go all the way from her playing children's games

735
00:47:42,675 --> 00:47:43,856
in a cave in the sunless city,

736
00:47:45,137 --> 00:47:46,017
writing poetry there,

737
00:47:46,137 --> 00:47:47,738
being afraid that the eye might be

738
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:49,259
this malevolent force after all.

739
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,581
And you can follow her through

740
00:47:52,081 --> 00:47:53,642
kind of overcoming some of those fears

741
00:47:53,782 --> 00:47:55,964
and eventually her pilgrimage to the quantum moon.

742
00:47:56,604 --> 00:47:56,804
So,

743
00:47:58,112 --> 00:48:04,693
showing these Nomai's lives as meaningful, as having accomplishments, as having positive elements to them,

744
00:48:04,773 --> 00:48:09,254
I basically, because I knew the comet was going to be what it was,

745
00:48:11,735 --> 00:48:14,916
we basically had to get rid of all of the Nomai, because otherwise

746
00:48:15,616 --> 00:48:22,217
they weren't gonna leave the solar system without having found the eye, that the pursuing their, they weren't gonna stop pursuing their ultimate goal.

747
00:48:22,757 --> 00:48:23,257
So, um,

748
00:48:25,318 --> 00:48:26,298
we had to kill them!

749
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:29,819
Gosh, please don't quote me on that one.

750
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,703
Point being, the more we can reward these smaller things,

751
00:48:34,763 --> 00:48:36,064
the better that's going to feel,

752
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:38,145
and it's also going to be this nice, you know,

753
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,728
reward for following along with the know my story.

754
00:48:42,569 --> 00:48:43,710
This is your final warning.

755
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:46,972
If you haven't played the game yet, you need to go.

756
00:48:46,992 --> 00:48:48,914
You need to go do it,

757
00:48:49,254 --> 00:48:52,377
because we can never come back from this point, okay?

758
00:48:53,177 --> 00:48:54,538
You're it, the rest of you.

759
00:48:56,602 --> 00:48:58,603
We're telling multiple stories in Outer Wilds.

760
00:48:59,183 --> 00:49:00,264
We're telling the player's story.

761
00:49:00,284 --> 00:49:01,465
That's the player experience.

762
00:49:01,985 --> 00:49:04,286
We're telling the story of the solar system,

763
00:49:04,346 --> 00:49:06,307
and later we kind of realize it's the story

764
00:49:06,327 --> 00:49:07,587
of the full universe, in fact,

765
00:49:08,788 --> 00:49:10,469
with all of that physical stuff that's happening.

766
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:13,050
And that's really entwined with player story to begin with,

767
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,651
because those are both happening in the present.

768
00:49:14,991 --> 00:49:16,231
And then we have the Nomai story,

769
00:49:16,271 --> 00:49:17,752
which is all happening in the past.

770
00:49:18,533 --> 00:49:20,594
These stories are all profoundly related to one another,

771
00:49:20,654 --> 00:49:22,294
and it becomes apparent as the player

772
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,335
progresses through the game.

773
00:49:26,295 --> 00:49:34,438
And the whole thing here is, and this is why it was so damn critical for me to get the player to empathize with the Nomai and be invested in them,

774
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:41,482
is that the Nomai have put in all of this work in the past and thought they failed.

775
00:49:41,782 --> 00:49:48,665
And when the universe is ending, when the sun dies, that finally powers this time leap device that they had made,

776
00:49:48,725 --> 00:49:54,087
and it gives the player the time that they needed to finish the journey to the eye, to reach the eye.

777
00:49:54,888 --> 00:49:54,988
And...

778
00:49:55,513 --> 00:49:57,274
The player's story occurs in the present,

779
00:49:57,454 --> 00:50:00,855
but you're doing it in parallel with the Nomai's journey.

780
00:50:00,895 --> 00:50:01,655
You're reliving it.

781
00:50:01,995 --> 00:50:03,736
You're making their discoveries with them.

782
00:50:03,776 --> 00:50:05,737
You're experiencing their successes and failures.

783
00:50:06,477 --> 00:50:08,338
And ultimately you are building on that

784
00:50:08,758 --> 00:50:11,619
and you are finally finishing that story.

785
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:15,121
And the more I have done my job,

786
00:50:15,201 --> 00:50:16,781
the more I have been able to get the player

787
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:18,322
invested in this emotionally,

788
00:50:18,902 --> 00:50:21,803
the more satisfying the end of the game is going to be.

789
00:50:22,476 --> 00:50:26,137
because it is that big payoff that you have been working this entire game toward.

790
00:50:26,678 --> 00:50:30,079
And I want you to finish this game, not just on behalf of you,

791
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:33,580
but on behalf of all of these characters in the world that helped you get there.

792
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:37,822
Alright, let's do takeaways.

793
00:50:38,262 --> 00:50:42,263
Y'all like takeaways? Let's do takeaways! It is amazing

794
00:50:42,563 --> 00:50:46,545
to me when story and gameplay can be closely integrated. I want to see us

795
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:50,486
take advantage of that, guys. This is a medium where we're able

796
00:50:50,526 --> 00:50:51,027
to do that.

797
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,353
No one else really can.

798
00:50:53,373 --> 00:50:55,876
We're not books, we're not cinema.

799
00:50:56,196 --> 00:50:56,817
Let's do it.

800
00:50:58,338 --> 00:51:00,160
Also, we could not have pulled this off

801
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,802
without clear design goals.

802
00:51:03,003 --> 00:51:05,926
In that regard, Alex is an absolute wonder.

803
00:51:06,627 --> 00:51:08,609
It allowed us to do some really cool stuff

804
00:51:08,669 --> 00:51:10,451
with storytelling and create this really

805
00:51:10,531 --> 00:51:12,213
unusually cohesive experience.

806
00:51:12,313 --> 00:51:14,395
And Indie's a great place to do that.

807
00:51:15,512 --> 00:51:17,193
Not that you always can, mind, but...

808
00:51:17,554 --> 00:51:19,034
And it's not a shot at AAA either.

809
00:51:19,174 --> 00:51:23,317
It's just, this is the sort of thing that's hard to pull off on a larger scale,

810
00:51:23,657 --> 00:51:24,697
at least from what I've seen.

811
00:51:25,638 --> 00:51:27,619
The larger your team is, the harder that gets.

812
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:32,802
And so, Indy's in a really good spot to be that level of cohesive.

813
00:51:34,325 --> 00:51:36,666
Also, we were in a great place to remain flexible

814
00:51:36,706 --> 00:51:40,027
and be able to iterate really rapidly and really often.

815
00:51:40,387 --> 00:51:41,567
And that did a lot for us.

816
00:51:42,087 --> 00:51:44,508
Again, not every team can do it, but if you can,

817
00:51:44,808 --> 00:51:46,228
I mean, it's a wonderful thing.

818
00:51:46,248 --> 00:51:49,909
I'll also point out that even though we have

819
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:52,430
an official story team in the credits,

820
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:53,890
which is Alex, Lone, and me,

821
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:59,291
I would not have been able to do this level of writing

822
00:51:59,671 --> 00:52:03,552
to pull any of this off without complete studio buy-in.

823
00:52:04,174 --> 00:52:07,595
the team really believed in the story and they believed in getting us there.

824
00:52:07,996 --> 00:52:10,536
And without them this could not have happened.

825
00:52:10,937 --> 00:52:14,598
So I owe them a tremendous amount for pulling that off.

826
00:52:15,538 --> 00:52:18,579
It's so critical for me as a writer to have that for my team.

827
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:24,282
I had a lot of success with kind of approaching things mentally as pulling

828
00:52:24,322 --> 00:52:27,743
versus pushing information. Please stop telling me why I care.

829
00:52:28,723 --> 00:52:30,684
Please make me care. I would love that.

830
00:52:31,389 --> 00:52:36,290
I love games that do that. It's really wonderful. It goes back to showing and not telling because again, we're games.

831
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,471
We're games, you guys!

832
00:52:38,651 --> 00:52:41,451
Don't assign me an objective to care. I won't do it.

833
00:52:42,972 --> 00:52:46,353
Also, I wanted to point out again, it's surprisingly okay to

834
00:52:46,953 --> 00:52:51,194
to have the player maybe not always immediately know what they're doing as long as you're still

835
00:52:51,694 --> 00:52:55,215
guiding them a little bit. Don't, you know, throw them in deep water, but

836
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:00,333
I think honestly, even if we were sweating it a little bit in development at times, thinking,

837
00:53:00,373 --> 00:53:06,197
oh boy, hopefully players don't get frustrated and give up and all that. There's a whole community

838
00:53:06,257 --> 00:53:12,582
of Outer Wilds fans who I absolutely adore. We have the best fans, we really do, who have proven

839
00:53:13,162 --> 00:53:18,186
that they're willing to put in the time to figure things out for themselves. Players are not dumb.

840
00:53:20,388 --> 00:53:23,689
they're going to figure it out, especially if they're having a good time figuring it out.

841
00:53:24,069 --> 00:53:29,572
And if we're not penalizing them for dying in the game, you know, if they're not losing items and

842
00:53:29,592 --> 00:53:36,835
all that, it really frees things up in a bizarre way. And I guess this is a little bit of my

843
00:53:36,855 --> 00:53:43,078
soapbox thing here, but it's my talk, deal with it. The games industry is still relatively young

844
00:53:43,258 --> 00:53:48,420
and we are still in our infancy as a storytelling medium. You guys, that is so exciting.

845
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:50,946
Oh my gosh, I love that.

846
00:53:51,266 --> 00:53:52,587
As somebody that works in narrative,

847
00:53:52,627 --> 00:53:54,669
obviously I'm a bit biased.

848
00:53:55,049 --> 00:53:58,131
I'm really excited to see what we can do from here.

849
00:53:58,772 --> 00:54:00,473
We're still trying all of this stuff

850
00:54:00,513 --> 00:54:02,334
and we're still learning a tremendous amount

851
00:54:02,374 --> 00:54:03,235
from it as we go.

852
00:54:04,296 --> 00:54:06,177
So, you know, if there's anything you take away

853
00:54:06,217 --> 00:54:08,639
from this talk, I really hope that you embrace story

854
00:54:08,659 --> 00:54:11,261
and narrative in your games and talk to your writers,

855
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:12,662
see what they can do with you,

856
00:54:12,842 --> 00:54:16,124
because we're doing some really cool stuff already

857
00:54:16,204 --> 00:54:17,806
and it's only gonna get cooler from here.

858
00:54:18,752 --> 00:54:29,900
to the future! Sorry, maybe that one was a bit much, hey? However, thanks so much for watching.

859
00:54:30,701 --> 00:54:34,343
Really appreciate it. I hope you learned something fun or at least had a good time.

860
00:54:35,244 --> 00:54:41,168
I've got some people to thank. A lot of people, in fairness. But B.M. Jacobson is a concept artist.

861
00:54:41,655 --> 00:54:45,757
at Mobius Digital. I have used some of his images here and I appreciate them immensely.

862
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:52,442
Everyone at Mobius Digital was a dream to work with, phenomenal human beings as well,

863
00:54:53,403 --> 00:54:58,346
especially Alex and Loan because I worked a ton with them and they're amazing storytellers

864
00:54:58,466 --> 00:55:07,332
and frankly, irritatingly brilliant designers. What can you do? Obviously, I should thank

865
00:55:07,372 --> 00:55:10,794
my family at this point, my partner John and

866
00:55:11,412 --> 00:55:17,076
my friend Dan for getting me through to this point on my talk because, you know,

867
00:55:18,037 --> 00:55:22,960
it was a little bit of a new thing for me. And thank you so much to GDC for having me.

868
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:28,344
I really appreciate it and it's been a genuine pleasure. I hope you all enjoy the rest of GDC.

869
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:29,145
Thanks again.
