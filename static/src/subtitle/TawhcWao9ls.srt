1
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,142
So first off, thanks for all being here at 530 on a Thursday.

2
00:00:09,702 --> 00:00:13,165
I feel truly honored to be here to not only represent

3
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:16,027
Gorilla and Horizon, but also to speak in front

4
00:00:16,047 --> 00:00:18,088
of such a really big group.

5
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:19,730
So that's really cool.

6
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:20,370
So thanks for coming.

7
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:21,931
Let's get started.

8
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:28,136
So two years ago, less than one year

9
00:00:28,436 --> 00:00:30,838
before we were going to ship Horizon Zero Dawn,

10
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:33,740
we were having a really big playtest.

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,321
The first one of many.

12
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:38,638
It was going to be 20 players for five days

13
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:41,061
playing through the entire game back to front

14
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:41,983
for the first time.

15
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:45,948
And we had set up telemetry and analytics,

16
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:48,932
and we'd set up surveys for the testers to fill out every day.

17
00:00:48,992 --> 00:00:52,857
And we brought our latest and greatest build at that time.

18
00:00:52,897 --> 00:00:54,759
And we thought it was going to be amazing.

19
00:00:56,867 --> 00:00:58,627
But the feedback was absolutely brutal.

20
00:00:59,628 --> 00:01:01,909
Almost instantly, we got negative responses.

21
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,530
The game was unbalanced, it was too difficult,

22
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,630
there were bugs everywhere,

23
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,951
and core mechanics were just not fun.

24
00:01:09,351 --> 00:01:12,132
And there's really nothing like playtesters writing

25
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:16,214
in all caps that your game is beyond disappointing.

26
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:22,917
So after five years of development and less than 12

27
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:26,140
months to go, I felt like we were in trouble.

28
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,181
I truly felt panic.

29
00:01:31,023 --> 00:01:33,625
I think we as game designers have quite a tough job.

30
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:38,348
At the start of the project, you have to convince people of

31
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,751
your ideas and drive gameplay concepts with very little to

32
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:42,071
go on.

33
00:01:42,756 --> 00:01:44,838
You have to convince your boss and team members

34
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:47,401
that your ideas are any good.

35
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:50,043
And if you do, you have to work hard to get them

36
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:50,664
into the game.

37
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:53,567
If you're lucky, you get to make prototypes.

38
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,569
And as soon as you make a prototype,

39
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:57,070
the feedback starts.

40
00:01:58,572 --> 00:02:01,235
Some positive, but usually it's quite negative

41
00:02:01,375 --> 00:02:04,418
because it's only 10% or even less of what you're eventually

42
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:04,878
going to ship.

43
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:07,615
And all of this creates doubts.

44
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:09,296
Did I make the right choice?

45
00:02:09,516 --> 00:02:11,158
Did you set the right goals?

46
00:02:11,538 --> 00:02:13,419
You start second guessing yourself constantly.

47
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,602
And this proceeds throughout development

48
00:02:16,642 --> 00:02:17,563
of your entire game.

49
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:21,106
And usually it doesn't even stop when you ship.

50
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:23,808
If you dare to go on forums after you ship,

51
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:25,830
there's a lot of stuff there as well.

52
00:02:28,552 --> 00:02:30,432
Today, Horizon is a big success.

53
00:02:31,313 --> 00:02:32,593
It's gotten critical acclaim.

54
00:02:32,613 --> 00:02:33,794
It's gotten great sales.

55
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:36,255
But most importantly, we have millions

56
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:38,316
of players who love the game.

57
00:02:40,757 --> 00:02:41,097
Thank you.

58
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:44,579
Thank you.

59
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,060
So the hard work definitely is worth it.

60
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:50,542
But sometimes you tend to forget that when you're

61
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:51,582
knee-deep in development.

62
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:56,178
Now I know, so game designers, it's their job to stay upright,

63
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:58,579
to take in all that feedback and to analyze it

64
00:02:58,619 --> 00:03:00,701
and try to tackle the problems head on.

65
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:03,923
And that's what I want to talk about today.

66
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,806
I want to share our version of staying upright.

67
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:09,907
I want to take you through the journey

68
00:03:10,127 --> 00:03:12,128
that the game design departments at Guerrilla

69
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:14,610
went through while making Horizon Zero Dawn.

70
00:03:16,004 --> 00:03:18,025
And I want to take you through each phase

71
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:21,667
and talk about the intentions we had during that phase,

72
00:03:21,707 --> 00:03:23,988
the goals we set, what we tried to achieve,

73
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:26,009
the problems we faced.

74
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:28,451
I can't talk about all the problems.

75
00:03:28,911 --> 00:03:31,392
We'd probably have to organize some sort of Horizon Zero Dawn

76
00:03:31,452 --> 00:03:33,173
problem summit for a week or something.

77
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:36,355
But I picked some that I thought were really interesting

78
00:03:36,395 --> 00:03:38,936
and that hopefully you can learn from or be inspired by.

79
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,740
And then I want to reflect a bit about what we did back then,

80
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,381
how we tried to tackle those problems.

81
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:47,162
But also now that the game is shipped,

82
00:03:47,222 --> 00:03:49,483
I kind of want to look back and see

83
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:52,564
what I would have done differently if we had the chance.

84
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:55,866
And my hope is that I can inspire

85
00:03:55,926 --> 00:03:58,868
you to press on when things get bad when you're

86
00:03:58,908 --> 00:04:01,829
making your games, and that maybe you can

87
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:03,270
learn from some of our mistakes.

88
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,260
So hello, my name is Erik, and I am one of the lead game

89
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,681
designers at Guerrilla Games.

90
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:13,162
I've been at the company for almost 15 years

91
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,583
and have worked on almost every game that Guerrilla has shipped.

92
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:22,285
I started out as a single-player level designer on Killzone 1,

93
00:04:22,905 --> 00:04:24,786
moved into game design on Killzone 2,

94
00:04:25,686 --> 00:04:28,327
went from single-player to multiplayer and online,

95
00:04:28,907 --> 00:04:32,028
and eventually became lead on Killzone 3 and Shadowfall.

96
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:36,293
And I've been trying to stay upright for quite a few

97
00:04:36,353 --> 00:04:38,834
projects, and I've seen my share of problems.

98
00:04:39,255 --> 00:04:41,956
And it only gets a little bit easier over time.

99
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:49,859
But to start talking about our journey, we have to go all the

100
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:51,740
way back to the beginning.

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,841
In 2001, the game design departments at Guerrilla, as

102
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,182
well as the rest of the company, was presented with a

103
00:04:57,242 --> 00:04:58,723
very early concept pitch.

104
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:05,302
This pitch was about 70 slides in PowerPoint.

105
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:08,165
Little bit too much to go through entirely,

106
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,447
but there were four major game design goals

107
00:05:11,747 --> 00:05:14,309
that we were gonna have to try and adhere to

108
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:15,130
and try to achieve.

109
00:05:17,892 --> 00:05:20,674
The first one talked about that the player

110
00:05:20,694 --> 00:05:22,956
was going to experience the majestic wilderness

111
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:25,478
of a future post-post-apocalyptic world.

112
00:05:26,788 --> 00:05:29,250
And essentially what that came down to is that this time

113
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,632
around, we wanted to make a beautiful world that the player

114
00:05:32,652 --> 00:05:33,532
would want to be in.

115
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:37,635
So up to this point, we had made Killzone games, which in

116
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:41,397
their own way are beautiful as well, but they are sci-fi,

117
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:46,120
dystopian, kind of dark worlds that usually you want to get

118
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,881
through and get out as fast as possible.

119
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:50,422
So for this time around, we wanted to make a game where

120
00:05:50,442 --> 00:05:52,083
you want it to be, where you want it to stay.

121
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:56,314
And we were going to inhabit that world

122
00:05:56,694 --> 00:05:58,356
with awe-inspiring machines.

123
00:05:59,156 --> 00:06:01,058
We had made action games before.

124
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:04,761
We felt we were getting pretty OK at it.

125
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:06,443
But we wanted to do something unique.

126
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:09,105
We wanted to do something that we thought

127
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:10,366
was never done before and something

128
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:11,847
that we really wanted to play ourselves.

129
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:13,649
So we thought it'd be a cool idea

130
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:16,472
to make gigantic robot dinosaurs and fight against them,

131
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:17,132
see what that's like.

132
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:23,554
The third goal we had was to also, besides the machines,

133
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:27,257
inhabit this world with exotic tribes and interesting

134
00:06:27,317 --> 00:06:27,697
cultures.

135
00:06:28,318 --> 00:06:30,519
So we asked ourselves the question of, OK,

136
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,542
we have all these beautiful cultures on the planet now.

137
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:35,203
They all go extinct.

138
00:06:35,683 --> 00:06:38,886
We go a few years ahead, and the humans come back.

139
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:43,089
How would those cultures, what would they look like?

140
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:43,929
What would they do?

141
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,791
And most importantly, how would they affect a player

142
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:47,852
going through a game?

143
00:06:50,634 --> 00:06:54,544
The fourth and maybe most difficult thing that we wanted to achieve was we wanted to

144
00:06:54,585 --> 00:06:56,550
make an open world, for the first time.

145
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,671
Because to us, this was enormously appealing,

146
00:07:00,312 --> 00:07:01,552
creating systemic gameplay.

147
00:07:01,592 --> 00:07:03,613
And if we did our job right, potentially

148
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:05,554
endless amounts of content.

149
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:09,536
Again, compared to Killzone, which in the single player

150
00:07:10,077 --> 00:07:13,478
aspect is a finite amount of levels that at the end of it,

151
00:07:13,739 --> 00:07:14,419
you're pretty much done.

152
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:16,800
And this time around, we wanted to create a world where

153
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:20,682
you could be in for dozens, if not hundreds of hours.

154
00:07:21,863 --> 00:07:24,184
But we knew that this was going to be an enormous challenge.

155
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,023
But we set out to achieve just that.

156
00:07:30,604 --> 00:07:32,966
And we started with what we now call the concept phase,

157
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:36,410
which ended up taking two and a half years, which

158
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,773
is a very long time for a couple of people

159
00:07:39,813 --> 00:07:41,135
to just try out stuff.

160
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:42,937
But you have to realize that this

161
00:07:42,977 --> 00:07:45,139
was a small but multidisciplinary team.

162
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:47,061
Because the rest of the team at this time

163
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:49,043
was on Killzone Shadowfall.

164
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:55,656
The goal for this team was going to be to design what Horizon was going to become, but

165
00:07:55,696 --> 00:07:57,817
more importantly, make it playable.

166
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:04,042
We wanted to find out what worked hands-on rather than just on paper.

167
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:13,288
And this concepting team started about eight people big and then grew to about 16 over

168
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:13,588
time.

169
00:08:13,808 --> 00:08:14,149
And it was a...

170
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,969
We had people from different disciplines in this team.

171
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:22,311
So designers, artists, coders, animators.

172
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:25,293
Another thing to realize, that at this time,

173
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:27,094
we only had Killzone content,

174
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:28,575
Killzone engine, and Killzone tools,

175
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:30,677
which again is all linear first person stuff.

176
00:08:30,777 --> 00:08:33,099
So we had literally nothing to build an open world

177
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,980
or third person action game.

178
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:40,124
So having all these different disciplines in there

179
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:42,626
created an autonomous group to build the prototypes,

180
00:08:42,686 --> 00:08:44,727
but they had a large amount of work ahead of them.

181
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:52,347
And their approach was going to be to answer the high level

182
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:56,851
questions that the concept pitch had formulated

183
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:57,751
in everybody's minds.

184
00:08:59,153 --> 00:09:02,195
Questions like, what was the combat against the machines

185
00:09:02,215 --> 00:09:02,856
going to be like?

186
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,418
We knew that the machines were going to be a key, unique

187
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,719
selling point from day one.

188
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:08,700
But how exactly will it work?

189
00:09:08,921 --> 00:09:12,023
What's it like to fight a big machine like that?

190
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,344
And what kind of weapons would you need?

191
00:09:13,384 --> 00:09:16,186
And how would you try and tackle those problems?

192
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:19,390
What kind of open world will Horizon be?

193
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:22,793
What makes a Horizon open world to begin with?

194
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:25,714
What kind of abilities will the player need

195
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:26,915
traversing that world?

196
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,776
And what kind of story do we want to tell?

197
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,078
So very high level questions that this team

198
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,679
started to try and tackle.

199
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:39,563
And at the core of our process was going wide.

200
00:09:40,754 --> 00:09:43,256
So we wanted to play the ideas and not just design them

201
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:43,736
on paper.

202
00:09:43,756 --> 00:09:46,258
So we wanted to really quickly create prototypes,

203
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,461
try out if they worked, and if not, ditch them immediately.

204
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:51,702
And if they did work, then iterate on them.

205
00:09:53,283 --> 00:09:55,385
I want to go through some examples of the prototypes

206
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:56,686
that we made at that time.

207
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:02,030
One of the questions that they tried to answer

208
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,311
was the combat against the robots.

209
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:07,064
So the team decided that it was a good idea

210
00:10:07,084 --> 00:10:10,486
to try and tackle this by coming up

211
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:14,709
with the biggest, most complex robot they could think of first.

212
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:17,610
And this very early design already

213
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:21,693
shows that a lot of the elements that we ended up shipping

214
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:23,194
were already present back in 2011.

215
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,881
For example, the vulnerabilities on the machines,

216
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:30,883
things like the eyes, were already designed in.

217
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:33,564
Shooting off armor plates that you could then

218
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:36,185
to get, that you then could shoot off

219
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:38,426
to expose those weak spots and those weaknesses

220
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:40,006
are also there.

221
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:42,947
Using the weaponry that it has,

222
00:10:42,967 --> 00:10:45,208
this is a, this, you know,

223
00:10:45,388 --> 00:10:46,769
disconnecting it from the robot

224
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:47,869
and then using it against them,

225
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,850
all of those concepts were there.

226
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:53,829
I've got a little video of one of the earliest concepts,

227
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,052
or sorry, earliest prototypes that we built back then.

228
00:10:57,753 --> 00:11:00,855
And this specific prototype was to try out

229
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:05,759
how the physics would work fighting this robot.

230
00:11:10,683 --> 00:11:12,865
So here we have a very early version of the robot,

231
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:14,926
and he's walking around in the environment

232
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:16,588
and the player can shoot rockets at him.

233
00:11:17,188 --> 00:11:19,370
And now when you shoot off the different parts,

234
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:20,371
what happens?

235
00:11:21,953 --> 00:11:23,435
How does that interact with the player?

236
00:11:23,955 --> 00:11:25,296
Will that kill the player?

237
00:11:25,676 --> 00:11:26,397
Is that even fun?

238
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:27,097
Well, probably not.

239
00:11:32,421 --> 00:11:36,905
It's a pretty elaborate robot, as you can see.

240
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:40,287
But yeah, it's really quick prototypes to try out.

241
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:45,311
It's really quick prototypes to try out

242
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:46,892
how it would feel, how it would look,

243
00:11:46,932 --> 00:11:48,773
and how it would interact with the environment.

244
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:51,966
And we did loads of prototypes like that

245
00:11:52,006 --> 00:11:52,887
to try out the combat.

246
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,770
Another question we had was about the open world.

247
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,192
What can you do in the open world?

248
00:12:00,212 --> 00:12:01,633
What kind of interactions will you have?

249
00:12:02,294 --> 00:12:04,155
And again, the team thought it was a good idea

250
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:08,158
to try out and build the biggest, most complex settlement

251
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:09,479
they could think of first.

252
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,762
This was kind of a playground where they could test

253
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:17,425
density, size, feeling, looks, atmosphere, and interactions.

254
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:20,030
And I've got another video to kind of showcase

255
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,953
what that was like way back then.

256
00:12:29,704 --> 00:12:30,706
Welcome to Mexico City.

257
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,961
So we used this prototype to really try out different things.

258
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:44,628
We tried to figure out what the architecture was going to be like, how the settlement was going to look,

259
00:12:44,668 --> 00:12:51,334
how many NPCs we would need, what would they be doing, how would the player traverse this settlement.

260
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:55,698
And you can already see a lot of different elements coming together.

261
00:12:58,093 --> 00:13:02,195
Another thing you might notice is that there's other robots present in the settlement.

262
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:05,976
Because back then we thought that if the robots were going to be present in the world,

263
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:08,996
they were going to be part of everyday life, so they would also be in the settlement.

264
00:13:10,977 --> 00:13:15,558
And this prototype really allowed us to try and figure out parts of what an open world was going to be,

265
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:18,739
and how the settlements were going to play a part in that.

266
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:25,741
And you might also be wondering why Aloy is riding a real horse instead of a robot horse,

267
00:13:25,981 --> 00:13:27,422
but I'll come back to that later.

268
00:13:33,018 --> 00:13:37,742
The third question I want to highlight is we were experimenting with different player abilities.

269
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,265
So what could the player use in types of weaponry,

270
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:45,529
but also how is the player going to traverse this immense world?

271
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,773
So one of the prototypes they focused on was the challenge of mounted traversal.

272
00:13:51,694 --> 00:13:53,396
It was something we never did before,

273
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:57,439
so we really had to learn how mounted traversal worked from a game design perspective.

274
00:13:59,937 --> 00:14:02,643
And this is a video of what kind of prototypes

275
00:14:02,663 --> 00:14:04,327
we were building back then.

276
00:14:05,229 --> 00:14:07,334
And this specific prototype is trying to figure out

277
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,739
how the player is going to interact with the mount.

278
00:14:10,568 --> 00:14:13,231
Because we knew our world was going to be quite large and quite dense,

279
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:17,654
we wanted to make sure that riding a mount was not too taxing.

280
00:14:18,935 --> 00:14:21,337
The player should be able to ride through a dense forest

281
00:14:21,597 --> 00:14:24,900
without having to constantly make small adjustments

282
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:27,262
and be able to focus on other things.

283
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:32,486
Things like shooting a bow or shooting or interacting with our NPCs.

284
00:14:33,267 --> 00:14:35,889
And this prototype tries out the AI system for

285
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:41,694
how the horse would actually navigate through dense objects like this.

286
00:14:44,476 --> 00:14:45,677
And it was actually quite successful.

287
00:14:45,737 --> 00:14:49,621
This is actually part of what we shipped in the end as well.

288
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:52,203
You can probably try it out if you play the game.

289
00:14:52,243 --> 00:14:53,784
If you go full speed through a forest,

290
00:14:53,884 --> 00:14:57,127
it's a lot easier to navigate through than you might think

291
00:14:57,467 --> 00:15:01,050
because the horse is already auto-adjusting its course for you.

292
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:07,314
So we were prototyping a lot of different things.

293
00:15:07,735 --> 00:15:09,216
And I think one of the takeaways here

294
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:10,497
is that this was really good.

295
00:15:10,998 --> 00:15:13,720
It really helped make Horizon what it is today.

296
00:15:15,322 --> 00:15:16,763
But it's definitely not cheap.

297
00:15:17,824 --> 00:15:19,706
Lots of prototypes we made back then

298
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:21,928
got either redone, thrown away,

299
00:15:22,428 --> 00:15:24,650
and it essentially takes a lot of time and effort

300
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:28,033
to do this approach, which I know is not for everybody.

301
00:15:33,523 --> 00:15:35,304
Now, during this phase, one of the problems,

302
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:37,666
around the middle part of the concept phase,

303
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:39,568
one of the problems that we started hitting

304
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:42,450
was that we had lots of interesting prototypes.

305
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,772
We had lots of interesting islands,

306
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:46,873
but it wasn't a cohesive experience.

307
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,516
You could look at the individual islands

308
00:15:49,596 --> 00:15:50,917
and say, like, okay, that's interesting.

309
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:53,579
But yeah, it wasn't a game yet.

310
00:15:53,739 --> 00:15:55,761
And this was quite scary for the team.

311
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,102
Doubts, second guessing.

312
00:15:59,443 --> 00:16:01,525
A lot of people started wondering, where's the game?

313
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:05,823
So the second part of the concepting phase,

314
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:06,983
we shifted focus.

315
00:16:07,864 --> 00:16:10,164
We decided we really wanted to try

316
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:12,145
and create a complete combat loop

317
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,347
in something that we call the proof of concept, or POC.

318
00:16:17,427 --> 00:16:19,928
And we wanted to try to see

319
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:22,609
if we could make everything work together.

320
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,390
Now the loop was something like this.

321
00:16:27,712 --> 00:16:30,314
We wanted the player to first explore the world,

322
00:16:30,675 --> 00:16:33,117
which is walking, traversing, climbing,

323
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:35,499
moving around the world,

324
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,802
and then interact with things.

325
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,065
And things could be talking to NPCs,

326
00:16:41,145 --> 00:16:42,406
it could be hunting robots,

327
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:46,290
anything interactable in the world.

328
00:16:47,638 --> 00:16:49,178
The third part was gather.

329
00:16:50,158 --> 00:16:54,079
So we wanted the player to gather the parts of robots

330
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:58,680
that you've killed, but also quest rewards or other things

331
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,700
that you find in the world.

332
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,601
And the last step in the core loop is progress.

333
00:17:04,181 --> 00:17:07,121
So everything you find or gather in the world,

334
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,782
you could use to upgrade your weaponry, your armor,

335
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:10,662
and your skill set.

336
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:15,483
So explore, interact, gather, and progress.

337
00:17:16,757 --> 00:17:19,117
So when we started to take all the different islands we had

338
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:23,199
and put them together and put a bit more art sauce over it,

339
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,280
this is kind of what we ended up with.

340
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:32,782
Sometimes I try to imagine what this place

341
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:33,743
used to look like.

342
00:17:35,203 --> 00:17:39,605
A vast desert, dead rock under a scorching sun.

343
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:45,987
But then the rains came and with it, the trees.

344
00:17:47,268 --> 00:17:48,069
The grass.

345
00:17:49,953 --> 00:17:51,475
All this life.

346
00:17:56,885 --> 00:17:59,910
And the magnificent cities of the Mesa tribe.

347
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,914
I can't even remember how young I was when he started training me.

348
00:18:06,554 --> 00:18:09,535
Climbing, archery, horse riding.

349
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,095
Everything I know.

350
00:18:11,996 --> 00:18:13,256
Everything I needed to know.

351
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:15,997
So I could track and hunt.

352
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:18,517
I pray.

353
00:18:18,957 --> 00:18:21,838
These truly magnificent machines.

354
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:29,031
A successful hunt takes everything you have.

355
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:33,273
Speed, strength, stamina, smartness.

356
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:38,134
But above all, you need to respect your prey.

357
00:18:38,955 --> 00:18:43,977
Respect how dangerous they can be.

358
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:47,238
And be grateful for what they give us.

359
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:56,828
So reflecting back on this time, making this POC,

360
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,009
making this proof of concept,

361
00:18:58,069 --> 00:18:59,651
really boosted the team's confidence.

362
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:02,573
Instead of having islands, we could start seeing

363
00:19:02,613 --> 00:19:03,834
what the game was going to be like.

364
00:19:04,995 --> 00:19:07,658
And we wondered if we should have started on that earlier,

365
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:09,759
considering we were already about two years in.

366
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,370
But we also wonder if we could have actually done that.

367
00:19:14,171 --> 00:19:16,872
Because I think the takeaway here, at least for us,

368
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:20,695
is that going wide and focusing on individual islands first

369
00:19:21,295 --> 00:19:23,336
allowed us to find what our game was.

370
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:26,718
And then focusing on building the full loop

371
00:19:26,998 --> 00:19:29,320
allowed us to detract what our game was not.

372
00:19:33,662 --> 00:19:34,763
At the end of the concept phase,

373
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:38,987
And questions that we had asked at the start

374
00:19:39,247 --> 00:19:40,248
were starting to be answered.

375
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,210
But some questions were not answered at all.

376
00:19:44,051 --> 00:19:46,632
And at the same time, new questions were being raised.

377
00:19:47,693 --> 00:19:52,236
But in 2014, at the end of the concepting phase,

378
00:19:52,997 --> 00:19:55,138
the studio shipped Killzone Shadowfall.

379
00:19:55,878 --> 00:19:59,421
So now we had about 180 people of the team

380
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:01,462
that had to move over to Horizon.

381
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:05,560
which heralded the start of the pre-production phase.

382
00:20:07,522 --> 00:20:10,205
And even though core player systems were not fully defined,

383
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:13,088
having more designers allowed us to also start focusing

384
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,811
on world systems, like quests and activities

385
00:20:15,892 --> 00:20:17,393
and things you could do in the world.

386
00:20:18,154 --> 00:20:20,877
Having more members of other disciplines join

387
00:20:20,937 --> 00:20:22,559
allowed us to really focus on building

388
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,001
what the world was going to look like.

389
00:20:25,613 --> 00:20:28,515
what kind of art assets and characters, terrain, foliage,

390
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:30,457
everything that we're going to need to build the full world.

391
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:34,039
Plus, it allowed us to start focusing on the story

392
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:37,542
and narrative as well, something that we hadn't done a lot yet.

393
00:20:39,503 --> 00:20:41,465
So with all these new team members joining,

394
00:20:42,085 --> 00:20:44,027
we set up three separate design teams,

395
00:20:45,388 --> 00:20:47,009
each with their own specific focus.

396
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:51,483
We have the core design team, of which I'm now lead of.

397
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,145
That focuses on the player systems.

398
00:20:55,345 --> 00:20:59,128
So everything having to do with traversal,

399
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:02,890
but also the combat and user interface and the economy.

400
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,852
Another design team we have is the world design team.

401
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,234
And they focus on all the world encounters,

402
00:21:09,414 --> 00:21:10,815
setting up the robots in the world,

403
00:21:11,315 --> 00:21:13,376
placing activities like the hunting grounds

404
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,157
and the banding camps.

405
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:17,633
but also focusing on living world,

406
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:20,094
so all the NPCs and settlements that you see in the game.

407
00:21:22,095 --> 00:21:24,897
And third design department is the quest design department.

408
00:21:25,557 --> 00:21:26,718
They focus on the main quests,

409
00:21:26,858 --> 00:21:28,218
everything that has to do with story,

410
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:31,480
cut scenes, dialogue, side quests, and tutorialization.

411
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,421
So three very specific design teams

412
00:21:34,821 --> 00:21:36,462
now focusing on the entire game.

413
00:21:40,628 --> 00:21:43,970
One of the problems we had, which ended up being actually a good thing,

414
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:48,673
is that during the concepting phase, we did have a lot of story ideas,

415
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:52,114
rough thoughts about what the story we wanted to tell was going to be,

416
00:21:52,475 --> 00:21:54,036
but there wasn't a full outline.

417
00:21:54,616 --> 00:21:57,257
Some writing was done, but it was done by the concepting team,

418
00:21:57,297 --> 00:22:00,519
and we didn't have any dedicated writers on that team.

419
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,201
So it lacked consistent context for everything that we were doing.

420
00:22:05,853 --> 00:22:08,656
The solution was that we formed an actual writing team,

421
00:22:08,776 --> 00:22:11,278
a narrative team, and the first thing that they did

422
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:15,322
was look at what we had and kind of looked at it

423
00:22:15,382 --> 00:22:16,984
and went, okay, well, we'll have none of that

424
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:18,665
and we're gonna completely restart over,

425
00:22:19,566 --> 00:22:20,987
which felt really bad at first

426
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,609
because it felt like five steps back,

427
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:26,192
but what they did very well is when they rewrote

428
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:28,995
a large part of the story, they set context

429
00:22:29,055 --> 00:22:31,017
for everything that we were doing at that time.

430
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:34,832
And I'll give you some examples of the changes that

431
00:22:34,872 --> 00:22:35,794
happened when we did this.

432
00:22:40,022 --> 00:22:42,066
I mentioned riding on a regular horse.

433
00:22:42,086 --> 00:22:42,607
So.

434
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,862
We wanted the player character in Horizon to be special.

435
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:52,544
Not like a super human or a super person,

436
00:22:52,564 --> 00:22:54,825
but at least slightly more special

437
00:22:54,845 --> 00:22:55,646
than the rest of the world.

438
00:22:56,366 --> 00:22:58,307
And another goal we had is that we wanted the player

439
00:22:58,327 --> 00:23:00,309
to interact with robots all the time.

440
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:03,170
They were our key, unique selling point.

441
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:05,532
Reiterating that and reusing that all the time

442
00:23:05,572 --> 00:23:06,472
was gonna be very important.

443
00:23:07,413 --> 00:23:09,854
So the big animals we had in the game at that time

444
00:23:09,894 --> 00:23:11,435
were getting in the way of those two goals.

445
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:13,657
So Narrative came in and they said,

446
00:23:13,677 --> 00:23:13,957
we're gonna go.

447
00:23:14,675 --> 00:23:15,696
Why not just remove them?

448
00:23:16,157 --> 00:23:17,518
Let's not have big animals.

449
00:23:18,498 --> 00:23:19,399
It doesn't make any sense.

450
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:22,562
And let's make the player able to ride robots instead,

451
00:23:23,122 --> 00:23:25,904
which achieve both goals and actually turn out

452
00:23:25,924 --> 00:23:27,205
to be less work in the end as well.

453
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,323
Another thing they did was focus on the main character.

454
00:23:34,643 --> 00:23:38,186
Now, Aloy has always been there from the beginning.

455
00:23:38,226 --> 00:23:40,487
We always knew that that was going to be our protagonist.

456
00:23:41,508 --> 00:23:42,669
But she lacked details.

457
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:46,031
And without those details, you cannot truly define

458
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:47,612
what she's going to be doing.

459
00:23:48,733 --> 00:23:50,234
Again, we had lots of islands, but we

460
00:23:50,254 --> 00:23:51,495
didn't know which ones were going

461
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:52,516
to make it to the final cut.

462
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:57,427
And through narrative and through the writing team,

463
00:23:57,747 --> 00:23:59,909
they were able to define her character, her arc,

464
00:23:59,929 --> 00:24:01,470
her personality, her style.

465
00:24:01,931 --> 00:24:04,573
And this allowed us to focus the gameplay around that,

466
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:08,456
rather than not knowing exactly where the ship was sailing.

467
00:24:09,317 --> 00:24:11,419
And this made everything that we had done so far

468
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:12,800
feel like it had a place.

469
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,682
And the stuff that didn't fit, we could actually let go of.

470
00:24:19,053 --> 00:24:20,274
Same went for the robots.

471
00:24:20,974 --> 00:24:24,435
We knew what, we had notion of some individual robots

472
00:24:24,455 --> 00:24:27,136
that we wanted to be, but mostly from a combat perspective.

473
00:24:27,456 --> 00:24:28,837
We knew how we were gonna fight them.

474
00:24:29,457 --> 00:24:31,638
But we didn't yet understand why robots

475
00:24:31,698 --> 00:24:33,498
were there in our world contextually.

476
00:24:34,338 --> 00:24:36,879
And without that, they lacked the right personality

477
00:24:36,999 --> 00:24:39,920
or feel when not engaged in combat.

478
00:24:40,883 --> 00:24:43,685
And the solution here was that when you define the reason

479
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:45,726
of why robots are there, which for us

480
00:24:45,786 --> 00:24:47,407
was the terraforming reason.

481
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:50,749
So the robots are there to rebuild the planet,

482
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:51,989
and they're part of a bigger plan.

483
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,431
And with that context, we could better

484
00:24:55,471 --> 00:24:59,213
define the looks, the behavior, and the feel of the robots.

485
00:24:59,934 --> 00:25:03,455
And it also generated a lot more new ideas for other robots

486
00:25:03,475 --> 00:25:04,316
that we could then build.

487
00:25:08,638 --> 00:25:10,299
And the last example is the world itself.

488
00:25:12,423 --> 00:25:17,707
We already knew at this stage what kind of activities we wanted from a gameplay perspective.

489
00:25:19,709 --> 00:25:24,833
Similar to existing open worlds, we wanted stuff like underground dungeons

490
00:25:24,933 --> 00:25:28,416
and we wanted challenges that unlocked parts of the map.

491
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:30,438
But they didn't feel Horizon yet.

492
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:34,801
Defining what the context was for the world

493
00:25:35,022 --> 00:25:39,225
allowed us to put a unique spin on all those gameplay elements that we already had.

494
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:42,899
So challenges that unlock parts of the map

495
00:25:42,979 --> 00:25:45,220
became the tallnecks that you see today.

496
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,301
And underground dungeons became the cauldrons.

497
00:25:49,421 --> 00:25:50,881
Even though the gameplay was still the same

498
00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:52,002
as we originally envisioned,

499
00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:55,363
context made our world feel unique and wonderful.

500
00:25:58,104 --> 00:25:59,544
So for me, the main takeaway here

501
00:25:59,764 --> 00:26:02,325
is that context does make everything better.

502
00:26:02,745 --> 00:26:05,947
It allows you to focus which mechanics work and which don't.

503
00:26:07,263 --> 00:26:08,986
And it allows you to define your world better

504
00:26:09,286 --> 00:26:10,468
and make it feel unique.

505
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:14,293
But again, being able to try out things

506
00:26:14,713 --> 00:26:17,397
without context first was equally important.

507
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:20,120
If you add context too soon,

508
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:23,485
you might prevent very cool ideas from ever being born.

509
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:25,247
So time it correctly.

510
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:29,724
So at the end of pre-production,

511
00:26:31,104 --> 00:26:32,926
more questions were being answered.

512
00:26:33,066 --> 00:26:34,787
We worked on the story and the narrative.

513
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:35,707
We had more context.

514
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:40,310
And the groundwork for Horizon was now there.

515
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,852
We had, we thought, most of the core mechanics.

516
00:26:44,393 --> 00:26:46,254
We had a world how we wanted to build it.

517
00:26:46,334 --> 00:26:48,135
And we now had the narrative to fill it with.

518
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:52,077
So we thought we were ready for production.

519
00:26:53,438 --> 00:26:54,819
But this is where the bigger problems

520
00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:56,780
started rearing their ugly head.

521
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:02,552
So we felt we were now able to start building the entire game.

522
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:06,715
And again, we thought we had all the core mechanics,

523
00:27:08,075 --> 00:27:10,076
or at least enough to get started.

524
00:27:11,377 --> 00:27:13,618
However, I think our inexperience

525
00:27:13,638 --> 00:27:16,160
with making open worlds really started showing here.

526
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,921
And I want to talk you through some of the problems

527
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:20,982
that we ran into at this stage.

528
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:27,570
The first problem we ran into is that we had this intention

529
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:29,752
to start at the beginning of our game.

530
00:27:29,872 --> 00:27:32,973
We felt that if you start at the beginning of the game

531
00:27:33,013 --> 00:27:36,075
and make that first, that's the part that 100% of all

532
00:27:36,115 --> 00:27:37,195
your players are going to see.

533
00:27:37,215 --> 00:27:39,296
And therefore, it has to be amazing.

534
00:27:39,957 --> 00:27:42,058
If you do this part right, hopefully you

535
00:27:42,098 --> 00:27:44,439
can entice players to then keep on playing.

536
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,160
So.

537
00:27:49,313 --> 00:27:54,076
Game design, at the same time, wants to expose and tutorialize

538
00:27:54,196 --> 00:27:57,438
core mechanics, things like health systems and combat

539
00:27:57,478 --> 00:28:00,921
and stealth, and write them into the narrative

540
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,442
to expose them effectively.

541
00:28:03,523 --> 00:28:06,364
Now, the problem with this is that quality narrative

542
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:07,625
costs a lot of effort.

543
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,046
You have to write the dialogue.

544
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:10,968
You have to build the characters.

545
00:28:11,028 --> 00:28:12,128
You have to make the cut scenes.

546
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:14,830
In Killzone.

547
00:28:16,138 --> 00:28:17,619
which we were still used to at that time.

548
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:21,641
All that structure is built in linear set pieces.

549
00:28:22,521 --> 00:28:24,362
You have level one, level two, level three.

550
00:28:24,382 --> 00:28:25,703
You have cut scenes in between.

551
00:28:25,743 --> 00:28:27,684
You do some storytelling during levels,

552
00:28:27,744 --> 00:28:29,885
but it's obviously not an open world.

553
00:28:30,845 --> 00:28:33,447
In Horizon, we needed to know exactly

554
00:28:33,647 --> 00:28:35,367
which mechanics we were going to need

555
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:38,029
because we needed to tutorialize them during this phase.

556
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,051
And in hindsight, it meant we had to effectively guess.

557
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:50,025
While we did this, we noticed during production later on

558
00:28:50,205 --> 00:28:53,409
that gameplay weight of specific features was shifting.

559
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:57,154
Systems that we had thought that were going to be important

560
00:28:57,655 --> 00:28:59,577
became less important and vice versa.

561
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:03,141
Because we added more mechanics later on,

562
00:29:03,401 --> 00:29:05,524
and new activities and new things to do,

563
00:29:06,264 --> 00:29:08,547
the gameplay, adding those effectively

564
00:29:08,607 --> 00:29:10,048
shifted the gameplay weights of others.

565
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:13,913
An example would be is that we thought

566
00:29:14,173 --> 00:29:16,355
that distracting robots was gonna be part

567
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:17,697
of our core gameplay.

568
00:29:18,618 --> 00:29:20,680
For example, the distraction rock that you can throw,

569
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,303
or seeing the patrol paths of different robots.

570
00:29:24,772 --> 00:29:27,915
When we finally got to building the world the way we wanted it,

571
00:29:28,195 --> 00:29:31,639
and the encounter, sorry, when we built the world,

572
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,483
the encounter spaces turned out to be much bigger

573
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,785
than we initially thought they were going to be.

574
00:29:37,746 --> 00:29:39,688
And this made it much easier for the player

575
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:43,052
to just avoid the robot encounters using stealth drafts.

576
00:29:43,373 --> 00:29:46,216
So throwing rocks, et cetera, became much less important.

577
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,271
And you can actually see that if you play the first quest

578
00:29:52,311 --> 00:29:55,032
of the game, we spend about an hour trying to teach you

579
00:29:55,052 --> 00:29:57,953
how to throw rocks, which ended up not being useful at all.

580
00:29:59,774 --> 00:30:00,734
Oops.

581
00:30:01,034 --> 00:30:04,375
So I think the takeaway here is that realizing

582
00:30:04,395 --> 00:30:06,496
that iterating on narrative is not easy to do,

583
00:30:07,277 --> 00:30:09,037
especially if you want to achieve high quality.

584
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:11,378
So I now reflect on.

585
00:30:12,822 --> 00:30:14,583
on the question, was starting at the beginning

586
00:30:14,643 --> 00:30:15,383
really a good idea?

587
00:30:15,783 --> 00:30:17,884
We thought we were ready, but obviously we were not.

588
00:30:18,124 --> 00:30:19,925
And I would argue that starting on the beginning

589
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,766
when you know the entire game would be better.

590
00:30:22,786 --> 00:30:24,447
And I would start on it later, actually,

591
00:30:24,827 --> 00:30:25,988
than we did the first time around.

592
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:33,492
Another problem came through the robot combat.

593
00:30:36,613 --> 00:30:38,254
So Horizon is built on the notion

594
00:30:39,132 --> 00:30:42,594
that the player has multiple solutions to tackle specific problems,

595
00:30:42,694 --> 00:30:43,775
problems like the robots.

596
00:30:44,575 --> 00:30:47,717
The whole point of Horizon is that we wanted to let you choose

597
00:30:47,797 --> 00:30:50,238
which solution you thought was most interesting.

598
00:30:50,618 --> 00:30:53,280
There are effectively no perfect solutions.

599
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:59,363
At the same time, we wanted to make Horizon a very accessible game.

600
00:30:59,543 --> 00:31:03,125
A very, everybody who would pick up Horizon,

601
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:05,867
we wanted to have something in the game for them to kind of enjoy.

602
00:31:07,287 --> 00:31:09,649
the threshold shouldn't be too high.

603
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,731
And those two ambitions started to clash.

604
00:31:15,372 --> 00:31:17,713
And this problem started to become apparent

605
00:31:17,773 --> 00:31:18,574
during playtesting.

606
00:31:19,114 --> 00:31:20,815
We started seeing difficulty spikes.

607
00:31:22,736 --> 00:31:26,238
Essentially, players who had lesser skill or were lesser

608
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:28,959
engaged with our game started to run into issues.

609
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,371
And the problem is relatively simple.

610
00:31:32,231 --> 00:31:35,733
If a game tells you that basic arrows can actually

611
00:31:35,773 --> 00:31:39,055
kill something, why would people who are lesser engaged

612
00:31:39,075 --> 00:31:42,176
with your game try out potentially more complex solutions?

613
00:31:44,057 --> 00:31:45,598
So at the time, we started to reflect

614
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:46,439
and we started to think, like,

615
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:49,180
how do we entice players to engage with other options?

616
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,661
How do we, and how do we do this

617
00:31:51,741 --> 00:31:53,322
without losing our core pillar

618
00:31:53,462 --> 00:31:55,903
of there not being a perfect solution to begin with?

619
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,001
Because we did consider at the time,

620
00:32:00,601 --> 00:32:01,661
moving away from that pillar.

621
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:05,822
We did consider making specific solutions mandatory

622
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:08,142
in order to destroy specific robots.

623
00:32:08,982 --> 00:32:13,683
And so effectively use weapon X to kill robot Y.

624
00:32:14,823 --> 00:32:16,584
When we started testing that out within the team

625
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:19,604
and with focus groups, the feedback was not positive at all.

626
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,825
It felt really forced and it didn't feel like a horizon

627
00:32:23,145 --> 00:32:24,885
because it went against our core pillar.

628
00:32:26,282 --> 00:32:27,863
So at this point, instead of doing that,

629
00:32:28,164 --> 00:32:31,286
we decided to show as many options as we possibly could

630
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:32,927
to the player.

631
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:36,810
And this is when we went all in on what

632
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,771
we call the focus tool.

633
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,174
This tool Aloy gets, and it allows

634
00:32:42,214 --> 00:32:45,777
her to turn on a type of almost like detective mode, which

635
00:32:45,857 --> 00:32:48,839
shows all the interactive objects in her vicinity

636
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,804
and shows her more options or more details about them.

637
00:32:55,698 --> 00:32:57,439
And this option at all really worked because it,

638
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,820
not only could they do it before combat,

639
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,281
people could oversee and in combat encounter space

640
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:03,502
and kind of start making a plan.

641
00:33:04,322 --> 00:33:05,903
They could also do it during combat

642
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,103
if their plan didn't work out.

643
00:33:08,424 --> 00:33:11,806
But at the same time, this introduced new problems.

644
00:33:12,646 --> 00:33:14,487
We wanted to make a beautiful world.

645
00:33:14,747 --> 00:33:16,588
And now we were blocking off parts of it

646
00:33:16,768 --> 00:33:20,769
with HUD overlays and less pretty

647
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:22,550
than majestic nature elements.

648
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,441
Plus, we simply just didn't have a lot of HUD space.

649
00:33:27,101 --> 00:33:29,683
How much information can you truly put on a screen

650
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:31,083
without overwhelming the player

651
00:33:31,503 --> 00:33:34,105
with too many bits of text and icons?

652
00:33:35,725 --> 00:33:37,906
But it did really inspire options to players.

653
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:47,585
Now reflecting a bit on that, I do believe that the focus does show possibilities and

654
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:49,867
not solutions, which is what we try to achieve.

655
00:33:50,608 --> 00:33:52,710
But it didn't solve the entire issue.

656
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:59,836
It simply added additional layers for the people that wanted that depth.

657
00:34:00,657 --> 00:34:03,860
It helped with the difficulty spikes, but it didn't fix the core problem.

658
00:34:04,937 --> 00:34:07,338
I think the takeaway here is that if you want the player,

659
00:34:07,818 --> 00:34:10,500
like us, you want the player to choose their own solution,

660
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,722
you have to consider how you're going to expose them

661
00:34:13,982 --> 00:34:14,682
to those options.

662
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,944
But you have to try and do this in the core gameplay,

663
00:34:18,384 --> 00:34:20,626
and rather than us, in an additional layer

664
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:22,046
that's on top of your core gameplay.

665
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,368
Enabling the player to see the options

666
00:34:25,428 --> 00:34:27,670
without having to do anything extra.

667
00:34:33,945 --> 00:34:36,686
Another problem we ran into was with the humanoid combat.

668
00:34:37,606 --> 00:34:39,847
So we knew from day one that robots

669
00:34:39,867 --> 00:34:41,388
were going to be at the core of our experience.

670
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:44,469
Unique selling point and all that kind of stuff.

671
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,791
But we also knew that we did know

672
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:49,231
that we wanted to do human combat.

673
00:34:49,632 --> 00:34:51,552
But we wanted it as a side activity.

674
00:34:51,572 --> 00:34:54,934
It was never supposed to be part of the main core gameplay.

675
00:34:56,515 --> 00:34:58,455
But at the same time during production,

676
00:34:58,495 --> 00:35:01,037
we started introducing more and more humanoid combat.

677
00:35:01,617 --> 00:35:02,257
Why did we do that?

678
00:35:03,473 --> 00:35:06,934
Well, the biggest problem is that robots just cannot speak.

679
00:35:07,634 --> 00:35:10,315
So story, with the narrative team now being there,

680
00:35:11,555 --> 00:35:16,897
wanting to tell a compelling story without humanoids

681
00:35:16,937 --> 00:35:17,897
was going to be impossible.

682
00:35:18,277 --> 00:35:20,958
So we introduced more and more humanoid characters

683
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:23,338
as we went along, which slowly made

684
00:35:23,378 --> 00:35:25,899
it go from a secondary activity to a primary one.

685
00:35:30,773 --> 00:35:37,140
And the second part of the problem was that we really did achieve making the robot combat

686
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,402
very deep and tactical and interesting.

687
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:43,406
And this highlighted the fact that the humanoid combat was not.

688
00:35:44,502 --> 00:35:48,966
Interestingly enough, when the robot combat wasn't as polished as it was during this phase,

689
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:53,910
when we did very early playtests, a lot of people commented on how cool the Yumo in combat was.

690
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:55,752
So we thought we were on the right track.

691
00:35:57,213 --> 00:36:00,276
Comments like, hey, it's even better than Killzone's combat.

692
00:36:00,296 --> 00:36:01,617
Hey, that's exactly what we wanted.

693
00:36:01,957 --> 00:36:05,700
But when we started polishing the robot combat, that went up,

694
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:10,024
and the difference between the two different types of combat really started showing.

695
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:13,370
And at the core of the problem there as well

696
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:17,171
is that humans just don't have as much tactical options

697
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:19,452
as robots necessarily have.

698
00:36:19,492 --> 00:36:21,532
They have fewer weak spots, fewer tactics,

699
00:36:21,552 --> 00:36:22,873
fewer choices, fewer options.

700
00:36:22,933 --> 00:36:26,094
So yeah, those two things combined

701
00:36:26,494 --> 00:36:27,574
started to become problematic.

702
00:36:29,134 --> 00:36:31,515
The solution we went for during production

703
00:36:31,955 --> 00:36:35,776
was that we wanted the tactical depth with humanoid combat

704
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:37,517
to come from the encounter design.

705
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:41,318
So, like in Killzone, adding cover,

706
00:36:41,438 --> 00:36:42,658
adding different approaches,

707
00:36:42,758 --> 00:36:44,939
and gaining an environmental advantage for the player,

708
00:36:44,979 --> 00:36:46,919
those were all key to making a fun encounter.

709
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:48,100
It was so in Killzone,

710
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,980
so we thought it was gonna work for Horizon as well.

711
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:53,241
And to an extent, you can see this working.

712
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:55,541
If you go through the cauldrons and the bunkers,

713
00:36:56,282 --> 00:36:58,102
or the bandit camps, the humanoid combat

714
00:36:58,142 --> 00:37:00,663
is already more engaging than in the open world.

715
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:03,530
But there lies the problem.

716
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,312
Horizon is an open world.

717
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,835
You therefore can never fully rely on encounter design

718
00:37:09,075 --> 00:37:11,398
because if the player comes from all different sites,

719
00:37:11,498 --> 00:37:13,340
then you cannot force the player in,

720
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,101
otherwise it wouldn't be an open world.

721
00:37:15,582 --> 00:37:17,063
And I think we truly underestimated

722
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:19,506
the impact of that early on.

723
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:23,489
In hindsight.

724
00:37:24,669 --> 00:37:30,343
I think we should have gone deeper on making a single human as tactical or as deep as the

725
00:37:30,383 --> 00:37:32,408
robots because I do think it's actually possible.

726
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,364
If we add more weak spots and let their behavior change

727
00:37:37,504 --> 00:37:40,347
once you fight with them, think more about their weapons

728
00:37:40,407 --> 00:37:42,669
and their armor, you could achieve a similar level

729
00:37:42,709 --> 00:37:44,811
of tactical gameplay that we did with the robots.

730
00:37:44,931 --> 00:37:46,953
We should have just focused on it earlier.

731
00:37:47,514 --> 00:37:50,436
Because this, to me, really creates systemic gameplay.

732
00:37:50,797 --> 00:37:52,879
And you don't have to rely on encounter design as much

733
00:37:52,919 --> 00:37:55,041
to achieve a cool combat encounter,

734
00:37:55,061 --> 00:37:58,283
because fighting one human in a space

735
00:37:58,444 --> 00:37:59,465
is just going to be interesting.

736
00:38:03,313 --> 00:38:06,014
At the end of production, we found a lot of the answers

737
00:38:06,234 --> 00:38:08,756
to the questions that we had asked in year one.

738
00:38:09,716 --> 00:38:11,277
But we found out the hard way

739
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,478
that we didn't ask all the right questions.

740
00:38:14,198 --> 00:38:16,820
Questions that in hindsight,

741
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,300
we should have asked way earlier.

742
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,063
The humanoid combat, the storytelling pacing

743
00:38:23,103 --> 00:38:27,205
versus the player, and how accessible our game

744
00:38:27,225 --> 00:38:30,106
was gonna be versus complex combat with the robots.

745
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:35,286
But the good thing news was that we could now play

746
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:37,008
our entire game from start to finish.

747
00:38:37,628 --> 00:38:39,409
All the content and the mechanics were in.

748
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,372
And this is where, like in the start of the story,

749
00:38:42,492 --> 00:38:44,353
we started playtesting a lot.

750
00:38:46,975 --> 00:38:50,458
But now, what we call meta issues started showing.

751
00:38:51,419 --> 00:38:54,802
Essentially issues that we had difficulty spotting

752
00:38:55,102 --> 00:38:56,863
during production and in concepting

753
00:38:57,164 --> 00:38:59,145
because we couldn't play the entire game yet.

754
00:39:00,016 --> 00:39:04,178
Now that the players were playing our game for days and dozens of hours,

755
00:39:04,238 --> 00:39:08,781
we were able to, for example, see and probably stress test our economy.

756
00:39:12,474 --> 00:39:14,356
Now, our intention with the economy

757
00:39:14,736 --> 00:39:17,358
was always, always have been to make it involve

758
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:19,620
all the cool content that we were gonna build.

759
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:22,863
The player would have to hunt all robot types

760
00:39:23,264 --> 00:39:25,786
and engage in all activities in order to unlock

761
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,988
all the different weapons and skills and abilities

762
00:39:28,028 --> 00:39:29,109
that we wanted you to unlock.

763
00:39:29,709 --> 00:39:32,232
This to us was what it meant to be an open world.

764
00:39:32,592 --> 00:39:33,753
Not just the main story,

765
00:39:33,793 --> 00:39:35,435
but engage with all the side content as well

766
00:39:35,455 --> 00:39:36,275
to unlock everything.

767
00:39:38,141 --> 00:39:39,323
So we set out to do just that.

768
00:39:39,523 --> 00:39:42,428
The problem was that this ended up in resulting

769
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:44,872
in there being a lot of different types of resources.

770
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,386
Each robot had their own unique set of resources,

771
00:39:49,886 --> 00:39:52,987
plus add the wildlife, plus add humans, plus add fauna.

772
00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:56,648
And we started seeing during the playtest

773
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:58,668
that the player was having difficulty understanding

774
00:39:59,328 --> 00:40:02,009
what resource was going to be used for what.

775
00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:04,929
It's really difficult to judge a value of something

776
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:07,270
when you have 80 different resources in your inventory

777
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,870
and they all look slightly the same.

778
00:40:10,797 --> 00:40:13,659
Plus the reverse of that problem also started happening.

779
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:16,941
We have merchants in the world where you can go to,

780
00:40:17,401 --> 00:40:19,683
traders, sorry, traders in the world that you can go to

781
00:40:20,223 --> 00:40:24,766
and you can get them to craft your own new weapons

782
00:40:25,247 --> 00:40:26,948
and you need to bring specific resources for that.

783
00:40:27,448 --> 00:40:29,269
But players were starting to ask questions like,

784
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:30,650
okay, so that's a cool resource,

785
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:32,211
but where the hell do I get that?

786
00:40:33,032 --> 00:40:34,813
So those kind of problems started rearing their head.

787
00:40:38,189 --> 00:40:42,973
Now, one of our intentions that made this problem even worse

788
00:40:43,493 --> 00:40:46,316
was that we wanted the tribes to be primitive.

789
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:51,203
So they wouldn't understand what a CPU is.

790
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:54,425
They wouldn't know what a camera lens is.

791
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:57,007
So they just call things as they see them.

792
00:40:57,507 --> 00:40:58,788
A lens becomes an eye.

793
00:41:00,409 --> 00:41:03,371
A battery, it looks like a coil, so let's call it a coil.

794
00:41:03,771 --> 00:41:06,993
And they know that if they shoot the middle bit of the

795
00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:09,375
robot and then it kills, well, that's probably its heart.

796
00:41:10,415 --> 00:41:12,977
So we created, essentially, a difference between the world

797
00:41:13,017 --> 00:41:14,278
language and the player language.

798
00:41:14,942 --> 00:41:18,428
And this abstraction layer also added to the confusion.

799
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:22,315
Players could not understand the value of something

800
00:41:22,415 --> 00:41:25,441
due to this ambiguity as well.

801
00:41:27,733 --> 00:41:32,317
So we were already very far into production

802
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:34,278
when we started realizing we had these problems.

803
00:41:34,758 --> 00:41:37,440
And it was truly too late to really change

804
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,841
the entire economy at this stage.

805
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:41,884
So instead, we focused on adding tools

806
00:41:41,984 --> 00:41:43,425
to mitigate those problems.

807
00:41:44,365 --> 00:41:47,347
An example would be the trader jobs that you added.

808
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:50,770
Now, raise of hands, who here has made

809
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:52,971
or used the trader job feature?

810
00:41:54,697 --> 00:41:57,798
Well, see, that's about less than 5% of people.

811
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:59,860
And that's exactly the problem.

812
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,721
It's, the feature sits really deep.

813
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:04,242
It's not part of the core.

814
00:42:04,282 --> 00:42:06,143
It's like five layers into the interface

815
00:42:06,203 --> 00:42:07,544
and most people don't even find it.

816
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:09,785
So that obviously didn't fix the core problem.

817
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,844
I'm going to be really honest with you.

818
00:42:13,985 --> 00:42:15,767
We really didn't fix this.

819
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:16,888
We failed.

820
00:42:17,708 --> 00:42:21,391
We should have realized way early on that the economy was

821
00:42:21,431 --> 00:42:22,893
just going to be way too complex.

822
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,196
And even though we couldn't test it, in hindsight, we

823
00:42:26,316 --> 00:42:27,997
should have realized that there was a problem.

824
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:31,420
But because we had never made an open world before, I guess

825
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,061
we didn't see it.

826
00:42:32,681 --> 00:42:35,327
So if one of your core pillars is accessibility,

827
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:40,016
you want something for everybody in your game,

828
00:42:40,477 --> 00:42:44,345
making sure that your economy is simple but effective is probably key.

829
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,024
In February 2017, the game launched,

830
00:42:51,244 --> 00:42:52,665
and it didn't do too bad.

831
00:42:53,225 --> 00:42:55,406
Actually, it's the most successful game

832
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:58,328
we have built to date, and we're very proud of what we've done.

833
00:42:58,808 --> 00:43:02,730
So again, all the hard work in the end is worth it.

834
00:43:04,171 --> 00:43:07,092
But if I leave you with something out of this talk,

835
00:43:07,553 --> 00:43:08,113
it would be this.

836
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:11,495
I think that if you, as a game designer,

837
00:43:11,915 --> 00:43:12,695
review often.

838
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:18,308
Review your goals, review your intentions and look at your problems constantly

839
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:21,672
and reflect during development to flag issues as early as possible.

840
00:43:22,612 --> 00:43:26,016
Be honest with yourself, find out what works and what doesn't

841
00:43:26,156 --> 00:43:28,818
and don't get stuck in ideas that are not working out.

842
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:32,733
But most importantly, you have to get ready for those problems.

843
00:43:32,853 --> 00:43:36,338
You have to build in flexibility during your processes, like we did,

844
00:43:36,378 --> 00:43:39,001
so you can try and adapt if necessary.

845
00:43:39,842 --> 00:43:42,305
I think that if you face your problems head-on,

846
00:43:42,966 --> 00:43:45,009
it's much easier to stay upright.

847
00:43:46,831 --> 00:43:47,092
Thank you.

848
00:44:01,037 --> 00:44:04,498
We have time for questions if anybody wants to come up to the microphone.

849
00:44:04,518 --> 00:44:08,620
Hi.

850
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,040
Hi.

851
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:14,942
I was wondering how you took these lessons and implemented them in the Frozen Wilds DLC.

852
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:16,760
That's a good question.

853
00:44:18,582 --> 00:44:22,626
Development of the Frozen Wilds, we did take these lessons,

854
00:44:22,686 --> 00:44:26,810
but some of the development already started earlier

855
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:27,931
than we could realize that.

856
00:44:28,972 --> 00:44:30,854
It was also a very different product

857
00:44:30,874 --> 00:44:34,297
to make because it's obviously an expansion on,

858
00:44:34,697 --> 00:44:35,338
but it sits.

859
00:44:36,379 --> 00:44:38,619
You can play it both at the end if you finish Horizon,

860
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:41,080
but you can also play it if you play through it.

861
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,900
Like if you're at level, I think level 15,

862
00:44:44,741 --> 00:44:45,741
that you can go into it.

863
00:44:47,081 --> 00:44:49,682
So it was a very difficult and different thing to make.

864
00:44:49,702 --> 00:44:52,482
And the goal for the Frozen Wilds

865
00:44:52,502 --> 00:44:55,663
was actually to really add a challenge layer.

866
00:44:55,883 --> 00:44:59,303
So we wanted to make everything more difficult and trickier

867
00:44:59,323 --> 00:44:59,683
to go in.

868
00:45:00,844 --> 00:45:02,964
So it was a very different beast to build.

869
00:45:04,711 --> 00:45:06,573
We couldn't fix the economy in that one either.

870
00:45:06,673 --> 00:45:09,055
We'd have to completely redo it in order to achieve that.

871
00:45:10,056 --> 00:45:13,198
But we did focus on some of the robot complexity

872
00:45:13,238 --> 00:45:14,259
and the tactical depth there.

873
00:45:14,299 --> 00:45:17,442
But yeah, it's difficult to apply those lessons

874
00:45:17,642 --> 00:45:20,244
in a DLC expansion, I think.

875
00:45:20,364 --> 00:45:22,766
I think if we do another Horizon,

876
00:45:23,286 --> 00:45:26,629
it's easier to implement those lessons.

877
00:45:26,969 --> 00:45:27,870
All right, thank you.

878
00:45:31,264 --> 00:45:32,145
This is kind of obscure.

879
00:45:32,165 --> 00:45:34,988
The bottom and left parts of the screen

880
00:45:35,008 --> 00:45:36,689
when you're playing the game, not in a menu,

881
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:39,292
are blurred, just at the corners.

882
00:45:39,312 --> 00:45:40,493
And if you pause, it goes away.

883
00:45:41,214 --> 00:45:43,336
Is this because of perf or a visual thing?

884
00:45:43,436 --> 00:45:45,698
Cause I could never stand it and just wanted to know why.

885
00:45:45,718 --> 00:45:45,758
Um.

886
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:48,180
Um.

887
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:48,260
Um.

888
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:48,681
Um.

889
00:45:48,781 --> 00:45:48,821
Um.

890
00:45:48,901 --> 00:45:48,941
Um.

891
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:49,101
Um.

892
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:49,161
Um.

893
00:45:49,181 --> 00:45:49,281
Um.

894
00:45:49,361 --> 00:45:49,401
Um.

895
00:45:49,421 --> 00:45:49,521
Um.

896
00:45:49,602 --> 00:45:49,662
Um.

897
00:45:49,682 --> 00:45:49,802
Um.

898
00:45:49,882 --> 00:45:49,922
Um.

899
00:45:49,942 --> 00:45:50,062
Um.

900
00:45:51,941 --> 00:45:53,743
I actually don't know.

901
00:45:55,584 --> 00:45:57,946
My tech director is here as well at GDC.

902
00:45:57,986 --> 00:45:59,628
I'll tell him, and then I'll get back to you.

903
00:45:59,668 --> 00:46:00,008
How's that?

904
00:46:00,128 --> 00:46:00,388
Thank you.

905
00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:02,850
OK.

906
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:05,072
First of all, thank you for putting such an amazing game

907
00:46:05,092 --> 00:46:08,856
together, considering that it's a world of PVP now,

908
00:46:08,876 --> 00:46:09,936
a lot of multiplayer.

909
00:46:09,977 --> 00:46:11,498
So great single player experience.

910
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:11,818
Amazing.

911
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:13,399
Thank you.

912
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:13,780
Yeah.

913
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:14,821
Thank you.

914
00:46:17,419 --> 00:46:23,261
So you talked about the amount of resources, but one thing I thought was interesting, I sort of discovered as I was playing,

915
00:46:23,461 --> 00:46:29,263
like the importance of switching, you know, your armor to get the, you know, based on the elements you were fighting against.

916
00:46:29,283 --> 00:46:30,323
Right.

917
00:46:30,543 --> 00:46:37,065
And, you know, typically in a game like that, you would just like find better armor and just equip it so you could sustain damage, but...

918
00:46:37,926 --> 00:46:45,361
What was the, you know, how did it work to make the conscious decision of having a fire armor or something against lighting, lightning?

919
00:46:45,421 --> 00:46:47,886
And, you know, how was that decided?

920
00:46:51,614 --> 00:46:54,295
With us it starts from the robots, the machines.

921
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:58,618
So we come up with what kind of robot we want to build and what kind of machine we want

922
00:46:58,638 --> 00:47:02,140
to build, what kind of attacks it's going to have, and then depending on those attacks

923
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:07,703
we derived how can the player engage with those attacks, how can they mitigate them,

924
00:47:07,743 --> 00:47:08,743
how can they fight against them.

925
00:47:09,644 --> 00:47:14,147
So what we wanted to do is we wanted to create this whole lineup of different outfits

926
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:19,610
That would be good for different types of robots different types of encounters, but again

927
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:23,492
It goes to the same problem. I was highlighting that if you

928
00:47:24,653 --> 00:47:24,713
the

929
00:47:25,294 --> 00:47:28,155
Those kind of choices are kind of three or four layers deep, right?

930
00:47:28,175 --> 00:47:32,057
For players to kind of think about switching outfits and for per encounter,

931
00:47:32,097 --> 00:47:33,257
that's actually quite a lot to ask.

932
00:47:33,277 --> 00:47:35,958
So you have to be quite engaged with the game in order to get to that level.

933
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,740
It is something actually that we focused on more in the DLC,

934
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:45,203
where specific robots really did fire damage and really did frost damage.

935
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:49,244
So the outfits became even more important there.

936
00:47:50,525 --> 00:47:54,389
One thing I think, I don't know if you, did you get the Shield Weaver outfit?

937
00:47:54,469 --> 00:47:58,252
Of course, that's the one I kept all the time.

938
00:47:58,413 --> 00:48:03,677
Funny story there, the Shield Weaver outfit, we knew it was going to be really powerful.

939
00:48:04,038 --> 00:48:06,540
We didn't know it was going to be that effective.

940
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:12,065
Once people playtested it and they got it, we knew it was good, but it was also quite difficult to get.

941
00:48:12,405 --> 00:48:17,449
But if we now look at the telemetry, I think almost 70% of all players get that almost early on.

942
00:48:17,489 --> 00:48:19,971
And that kind of screwed our economy in a different way as well.

943
00:48:20,371 --> 00:48:25,955
But it sounds like you're interacting with the different outfits, so at least we got that with one person.

944
00:48:25,975 --> 00:48:30,278
Until I got that armor, and the Frozen Wild, it was pretty good. So thanks.

945
00:48:30,298 --> 00:48:31,119
That was useful, right?

946
00:48:34,488 --> 00:48:34,568
Yes.

947
00:48:34,988 --> 00:48:35,148
Hi.

948
00:48:35,808 --> 00:48:42,812
At the beginning of the talk, you showed us some information about the playtesting that was done

949
00:48:42,852 --> 00:48:47,074
and the rather harsh feedback you got about a year before you shipped.

950
00:48:48,255 --> 00:48:54,739
It was a little unclear to me what changed in the year that followed that made it such a great game.

951
00:48:54,779 --> 00:49:00,862
Was it an issue of the playtesters not getting it, or was there a huge amount of legit...

952
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:04,029
you know, stuff that needed to be fixed.

953
00:49:04,531 --> 00:49:05,934
I guess I'm interested in knowing

954
00:49:06,355 --> 00:49:08,601
to what level were things really broken.

955
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:13,801
Right, I think that it was a combination of all factors.

956
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:16,143
I think there were balance issues,

957
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:17,724
like literally balance issues.

958
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:21,367
I think a lot of the robots were really tweaked

959
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:24,129
to be quite hardcore and quite like doing lots of damage.

960
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:27,032
I think that was a problem for people.

961
00:49:27,352 --> 00:49:29,293
And that combined with some of the mechanics

962
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,494
not working quite right yet,

963
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:32,996
like the amount of information we had in the focus,

964
00:49:33,016 --> 00:49:36,299
for example, or the amount of tutorialization

965
00:49:36,339 --> 00:49:37,239
we were doing in the...

966
00:49:39,721 --> 00:49:40,863
in the main quest, etc.

967
00:49:41,503 --> 00:49:43,085
Everything kind of contributed to

968
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,986
a lot of people just not

969
00:49:45,147 --> 00:49:47,028
getting into the core

970
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:47,969
mechanics of the game.

971
00:49:49,951 --> 00:49:51,152
I think it just took a lot

972
00:49:51,232 --> 00:49:52,894
of iterating to get that all right.

973
00:49:53,114 --> 00:49:55,336
I don't think you can put your finger

974
00:49:55,396 --> 00:49:57,138
on one problem and then go

975
00:49:57,178 --> 00:49:58,819
once we fix that, then everything went away.

976
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:00,721
But it was an iterative process

977
00:50:00,881 --> 00:50:02,202
over the next year.

978
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:07,862
more than 15 big playtests.

979
00:50:08,523 --> 00:50:10,185
And every time, like every two or three weeks,

980
00:50:10,226 --> 00:50:12,769
we would do major changes and test again and test again

981
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:15,893
and test again until we got it more right.

982
00:50:17,495 --> 00:50:18,476
One interesting thing though,

983
00:50:18,536 --> 00:50:20,279
is that the way we did the playtesting,

984
00:50:22,634 --> 00:50:26,457
We're telling 20 people to play through the entire game

985
00:50:26,517 --> 00:50:27,178
in five days.

986
00:50:27,478 --> 00:50:29,640
And that is a very specific mindset.

987
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,522
So one thing we did also learn from that

988
00:50:31,582 --> 00:50:35,005
was that not all feedback is actually

989
00:50:35,025 --> 00:50:37,707
relevant once you get it out in the wild.

990
00:50:39,308 --> 00:50:42,031
Once you're playing on your couch at home,

991
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:43,332
people have a different mindset.

992
00:50:43,392 --> 00:50:45,835
And some of the problems that people are trying to rush

993
00:50:45,895 --> 00:50:48,097
through it, for the coin a phrase,

994
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:52,301
they run into different issues than people

995
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:53,763
that buy your game in the end.

996
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:55,365
Okay, thanks.

997
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:55,785
All right.

998
00:50:56,466 --> 00:50:56,586
Yes.

999
00:50:58,353 --> 00:50:58,873
You were first.

1000
00:50:59,673 --> 00:51:01,534
Thank you for the talk, it was really interesting.

1001
00:51:03,095 --> 00:51:07,177
You talked a lot about the different phases, like starting in concept phase and so on.

1002
00:51:07,817 --> 00:51:12,919
Could you talk a little bit about the phase before concept phase, so like the really,

1003
00:51:13,059 --> 00:51:18,081
the very initial getting the idea phase and who was involved in this process?

1004
00:51:18,581 --> 00:51:18,881
Sure.

1005
00:51:20,483 --> 00:51:23,145
My studio art director gave a talk, I think,

1006
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:25,167
two days ago that kind of went into that.

1007
00:51:25,227 --> 00:51:28,531
But the gist of it was that Gorilla actually

1008
00:51:28,751 --> 00:51:32,314
asked the entire company to come up with new concepts.

1009
00:51:32,955 --> 00:51:37,299
And we made a brief, because we obviously didn't want to.

1010
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,460
Guerrilla makes a certain type of games.

1011
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,821
So if somebody comes up with, let's make a soccer game

1012
00:51:41,861 --> 00:51:43,682
or something like that, well, that's just not going to fly.

1013
00:51:44,042 --> 00:51:45,983
So we made a brief of the type of pitches

1014
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:47,564
that we were looking for and what kind of rules

1015
00:51:47,584 --> 00:51:48,544
they needed to adhere to.

1016
00:51:49,145 --> 00:51:51,065
And then, yeah, essentially everybody in the company

1017
00:51:51,126 --> 00:51:52,726
had a chance to create a pitch.

1018
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,287
They were given time during work hours

1019
00:51:55,547 --> 00:51:58,549
to work on their pitch and pitch it to the managers

1020
00:51:59,129 --> 00:52:00,470
and to the leads, et cetera.

1021
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,651
And I think we had about 80 different pitches internally.

1022
00:52:05,132 --> 00:52:08,354
ranging from anything from like two sentences

1023
00:52:08,454 --> 00:52:11,557
to full decks with beautiful movies

1024
00:52:11,597 --> 00:52:12,337
and all that kind of stuff.

1025
00:52:13,298 --> 00:52:17,041
Yeah, and then one thing that we did

1026
00:52:17,081 --> 00:52:18,742
is we shared a lot of those pictures

1027
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,063
with the rest of the company as well.

1028
00:52:20,644 --> 00:52:22,725
We asked which ones stood out.

1029
00:52:23,466 --> 00:52:25,367
We narrowed down all the different pictures

1030
00:52:25,448 --> 00:52:28,090
until finally we came to Horizon.

1031
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:29,851
And everybody, well a lot of people actually

1032
00:52:30,171 --> 00:52:32,273
gravitated towards Horizon quite early on.

1033
00:52:33,694 --> 00:52:33,954
Thank you.

1034
00:52:36,284 --> 00:52:37,485
Thank you so much for a great talk.

1035
00:52:38,166 --> 00:52:39,907
Just out of curiosity, in the final game,

1036
00:52:39,927 --> 00:52:42,669
each species seems to be restricted

1037
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:44,851
in their own area on the map.

1038
00:52:45,311 --> 00:52:46,933
Was it ever part of the play test,

1039
00:52:47,093 --> 00:52:49,415
or was this play tested to have like a thunder jaw

1040
00:52:49,635 --> 00:52:50,756
chase you across the entire map?

1041
00:52:52,561 --> 00:52:53,821
Was it playtested? No.

1042
00:52:54,622 --> 00:52:55,682
Did we think about it? Yes.

1043
00:52:55,782 --> 00:52:59,184
But there are quite a lot of technical difficulties that we don't have to...

1044
00:52:59,204 --> 00:53:01,825
It basically comes down to memory streaming, right?

1045
00:53:01,865 --> 00:53:04,466
We only have a finite amount of memory and these robots are quite...

1046
00:53:04,506 --> 00:53:06,387
The machines are quite heavy on memory.

1047
00:53:07,247 --> 00:53:07,587
So if...

1048
00:53:08,147 --> 00:53:09,248
Like, to stream that in,

1049
00:53:09,628 --> 00:53:11,729
if the player is going from one tile to the next

1050
00:53:11,809 --> 00:53:13,950
and they bring robots with them or something like that,

1051
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:14,230
that's...

1052
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:15,931
We're going to run out of memory.

1053
00:53:16,571 --> 00:53:17,511
So that's why they're kind of...

1054
00:53:18,556 --> 00:53:20,637
Hopefully you don't see that too clearly,

1055
00:53:20,677 --> 00:53:23,219
but they're tied to their encounter spaces

1056
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:25,101
and that they stay in the same area.

1057
00:53:27,262 --> 00:53:30,725
Yeah, it's a question between like how graphical fidelity

1058
00:53:30,785 --> 00:53:32,266
and how pretty you want things to look

1059
00:53:32,306 --> 00:53:34,467
versus like how much freedom you have.

1060
00:53:34,527 --> 00:53:37,409
So we kind of came to this balance.

1061
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:38,310
Thank you.

1062
00:53:40,151 --> 00:53:41,092
I think you were there first.

1063
00:53:41,692 --> 00:53:41,973
Was I?

1064
00:53:42,253 --> 00:53:42,913
No, you were first.

1065
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:43,574
No, you were first.

1066
00:53:43,694 --> 00:53:43,894
Okay.

1067
00:53:45,042 --> 00:53:45,822
All right, I'll go.

1068
00:53:46,662 --> 00:53:49,563
Hi, I really love the game, really liked its protagonist.

1069
00:53:50,223 --> 00:53:53,064
You showed a lot of early concepts and early prototypes.

1070
00:53:53,124 --> 00:53:54,624
And one thing that surprised me is

1071
00:53:54,724 --> 00:53:57,885
that the player character was always

1072
00:53:57,965 --> 00:54:00,586
this same redheaded woman.

1073
00:54:00,646 --> 00:54:01,886
So it surprised me that you didn't

1074
00:54:02,566 --> 00:54:04,587
seem to iterate over that in any capacity.

1075
00:54:04,607 --> 00:54:06,547
And I was wondering if there was an interesting story

1076
00:54:06,587 --> 00:54:07,007
behind that.

1077
00:54:07,928 --> 00:54:09,588
Like how Aloy came to be?

1078
00:54:09,648 --> 00:54:11,428
Yeah, why was she there from the beginning?

1079
00:54:11,689 --> 00:54:13,309
Well, I think one of the interesting bits

1080
00:54:13,329 --> 00:54:13,549
that we.

1081
00:54:15,614 --> 00:54:18,296
It was a conscious choice, but I don't think we ever really...

1082
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:23,060
It's not something that we had millions of meetings about or anything like that.

1083
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,802
It's just like that was the first idea we had.

1084
00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:29,366
We all thought it was pretty cool and then she stuck around

1085
00:54:29,446 --> 00:54:30,827
and then she developed over time.

1086
00:54:30,847 --> 00:54:31,868
Cool.

1087
00:54:32,488 --> 00:54:36,332
I mean, we get a lot of good responses about having a female protagonist

1088
00:54:36,412 --> 00:54:39,214
and that's really cool, but we never really thought about it that much.

1089
00:54:39,274 --> 00:54:40,375
We just kind of did it.

1090
00:54:41,356 --> 00:54:47,105
I guess there isn't really a big interesting story I can tell you there because it just kind of, yeah, it just occurred.

1091
00:54:47,706 --> 00:54:50,270
Awesome. It just stood out that she was always there.

1092
00:54:50,551 --> 00:54:50,791
Yeah, yeah.

1093
00:54:50,831 --> 00:54:51,091
Thanks.

1094
00:54:52,620 --> 00:55:00,185
Hi. The crafting job system that you sort of self-deprecatingly reamed at the end of the talk,

1095
00:55:00,825 --> 00:55:08,370
I remember there being marketing messaging about that system sometime between the E3 reveal and the game's launch.

1096
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:15,314
I was kind of curious, and just because I remember kind of a weird emphasis on this being like one of the special selling points of the open world,

1097
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:16,055
I was curious if you...

1098
00:55:17,996 --> 00:55:20,917
learned anything about trying to communicate to players

1099
00:55:21,857 --> 00:55:24,138
in that space about features that you didn't think

1100
00:55:24,158 --> 00:55:25,259
they'd find very quickly?

1101
00:55:25,719 --> 00:55:27,100
And if you had any success with that?

1102
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,281
Did you have success with the core community of players?

1103
00:55:29,321 --> 00:55:32,382
Like, were they trying to explain hard things to players?

1104
00:55:32,422 --> 00:55:33,322
Did that work or not?

1105
00:55:33,523 --> 00:55:34,923
That's the actual question mark.

1106
00:55:36,424 --> 00:55:39,065
That's quite a, yeah, that's quite a tricky question

1107
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,346
because I'm also trying to remember

1108
00:55:40,386 --> 00:55:43,247
the marketing message that you referred to.

1109
00:55:44,342 --> 00:55:48,606
I remember, if you need help, it was like one video running through an open world quest

1110
00:55:48,666 --> 00:55:52,750
and I'm remembering there was like five minutes of like, oh, hey, you can, if you're needing

1111
00:55:52,791 --> 00:55:55,633
a resource to craft this thing, here's the crafting job system.

1112
00:55:55,653 --> 00:55:56,674
Right, okay, yeah.

1113
00:55:56,754 --> 00:56:01,319
So yeah, I think there was, there definitely was some unfortunate ways how that was interpreted

1114
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:05,203
because it was, I think, even incorrect at that time, like when that marketing message

1115
00:56:05,243 --> 00:56:07,385
got released, there wasn't how the system worked.

1116
00:56:09,267 --> 00:56:11,909
But if your question is, did we learn anything from that?

1117
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:15,111
From, I guess, like, OK, we know the system is intricate,

1118
00:56:15,131 --> 00:56:16,692
but we're going to try and tell people about it.

1119
00:56:17,653 --> 00:56:19,894
Even versus the simple approach of just shoot arrows

1120
00:56:19,915 --> 00:56:20,555
until it dies.

1121
00:56:20,915 --> 00:56:22,496
Did you learn anything about player messaging

1122
00:56:22,536 --> 00:56:24,518
and telling players how things work after the fact?

1123
00:56:28,641 --> 00:56:29,662
Well, no.

1124
00:56:29,822 --> 00:56:32,764
I can't think of anything right now, but maybe after the,

1125
00:56:32,824 --> 00:56:34,645
we can chat after the talk, after the Q&A.

1126
00:56:34,665 --> 00:56:35,086
All right, cheers.

1127
00:56:37,762 --> 00:56:37,922
Yes.

1128
00:56:38,343 --> 00:56:46,708
Well, in early prototype phase you showed it was alloy with a rocket launcher against

1129
00:56:46,868 --> 00:56:47,348
a robot.

1130
00:56:47,368 --> 00:56:47,728
Right.

1131
00:56:48,129 --> 00:56:51,191
So what was the reason you refused the guns?

1132
00:56:54,848 --> 00:56:56,049
It's a combination of two things.

1133
00:56:57,009 --> 00:57:03,832
The most important thing being is that we felt that if you use high explosives or guns

1134
00:57:03,892 --> 00:57:08,674
or anything against that, it's very quick over range, it's very powerful.

1135
00:57:09,294 --> 00:57:14,116
And we actually thought the contrast of fighting a gigantic high tech machine with very basic

1136
00:57:14,217 --> 00:57:18,578
arrows, not only from a contextual perspective but also from a gameplay perspective was much

1137
00:57:18,618 --> 00:57:22,000
more interesting because it would take much longer to take down the different robots and

1138
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,000
to expose the weaknesses.

1139
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,963
Whereas with a big explosion, you expect parts to fly off,

1140
00:57:27,284 --> 00:57:29,846
like in the video, but with bows and arrows,

1141
00:57:29,886 --> 00:57:30,566
that wasn't the case.

1142
00:57:30,586 --> 00:57:33,108
So we could add more technical depth by doing this,

1143
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:36,931
as well as obviously that we thought that the visuals

1144
00:57:36,991 --> 00:57:40,174
of David versus Goliath kind of visuals

1145
00:57:40,214 --> 00:57:42,315
with a bow and arrow taking down a thunder jaw

1146
00:57:42,335 --> 00:57:44,217
was also a very cool juxtaposition

1147
00:57:44,237 --> 00:57:44,857
to play around with.

1148
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:46,058
Okay, thank you.

1149
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:48,700
I think I have time for one more question.

1150
00:57:51,356 --> 00:57:52,878
Congrats on the win last night by the way.

1151
00:57:53,018 --> 00:57:53,419
Oh, thank you.

1152
00:57:53,439 --> 00:57:55,441
Technical achievement.

1153
00:57:55,822 --> 00:57:56,102
Woo!

1154
00:57:56,242 --> 00:57:57,664
I was pulling for game of the year, but whatever.

1155
00:57:59,006 --> 00:58:05,975
So, you mentioned the tutorial, how it ended up kind of being not exactly representative of what the rest of the game was.

1156
00:58:05,995 --> 00:58:06,095
Great.

1157
00:58:07,236 --> 00:58:13,722
Would you like if knowing what the game turned out to be right and um would you recommend?

1158
00:58:14,623 --> 00:58:21,128
Making the rest of the game and then saying like because the the narrative of the tor tutorial could have been the same thing really

1159
00:58:21,148 --> 00:58:23,550
You know a lowly falls and rock and goes through trials

1160
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:28,674
Would you say make the rest of the game and then go back and do the tutorial not the rest of the game?

1161
00:58:28,694 --> 00:58:34,860
But I would really make sure that you truly understand your core mechanics and because that's what you want to teach at the beginning, right?

1162
00:58:36,125 --> 00:58:40,528
And I think, like I mentioned, because we hadn't really made

1163
00:58:40,588 --> 00:58:43,490
the bigger part of the world yet where the counter space has

1164
00:58:43,551 --> 00:58:45,932
changed, we didn't realize that the gameplay was going

1165
00:58:45,952 --> 00:58:48,034
to change as well, and that players would just not

1166
00:58:48,214 --> 00:58:49,075
use those abilities.

1167
00:58:49,415 --> 00:58:55,019
So I guess it's like, I wouldn't completely turn it around.

1168
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:56,820
Like, I wouldn't do the beginning at the end,

1169
00:58:57,121 --> 00:58:58,642
but I would do it slightly later.

1170
00:58:58,662 --> 00:58:59,162
OK.

1171
00:58:59,763 --> 00:59:00,003
Thank you.

1172
00:59:00,803 --> 00:59:03,325
Well, thank you all for your time, and I hope you enjoyed it.
