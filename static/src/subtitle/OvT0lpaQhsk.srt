00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,512
Hello everyone and welcome to the Animation Microtalks.

2
00:00:14,632 --> 00:00:19,057
We're so thrilled to have you join us here today with a quick show of hands, who here has been to a Microtalks before?

3
00:00:20,273 --> 00:00:21,533
All right, all right, quite a number of you.

4
00:00:21,994 --> 00:00:22,754
That's fantastic.

5
00:00:22,834 --> 00:00:23,714
Well, welcome back.

6
00:00:23,954 --> 00:00:25,515
It's great that some of you already know what you're in for.

7
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:28,175
For those of you who don't, let's start off with an introduction.

8
00:00:28,636 --> 00:00:29,836
My name is Brandon Mason McConkey.

9
00:00:29,876 --> 00:00:35,998
I'm a senior animator on the Overwatch team at Blizzard, and I've been involved in the Microtalks either as a panelist or a co-host for the last four years.

10
00:00:36,698 --> 00:00:42,400
Each year, we choose a theme that guides these talks in order to make sure that they are cohesive in narrative and structure.

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,021
And yet, despite our best efforts, they still tend to be pretty chaotic.

12
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:51,537
We've had deep dives into bat facts, diatribes against crutch culture, and one year we even closed out with a musical number.

13
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:53,902
But you know what, that's part of their charm.

14
00:00:54,183 --> 00:00:59,286
Unlike the other sessions you might see at the Animation Summit, the MicroTalk series isn't meant to leave you with trade or technical secrets.

15
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:04,611
You won't be learning new animation layer workflows or how to untangle the noodley mess of your state machines.

16
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:07,893
Instead, these talks will focus more on the culture of animating in our field.

17
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:10,495
Experiences, observations, rants, wild musings.

18
00:01:10,956 --> 00:01:17,561
Our goal is to offer insight into the aspects of the industry that aren't often discussed, and to do so through the individual lenses of our panelists.

19
00:01:17,961 --> 00:01:20,222
So, what unifying theme did we choose this year?

20
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:22,123
Well, that's actually pretty tricky.

21
00:01:22,563 --> 00:01:25,165
Generally speaking, we like to keep three things in mind when crafting them.

22
00:01:25,605 --> 00:01:33,990
First, it should be broad enough so that 10 speakers can create unique presentations that don't all discuss the same ideas while still providing enough focus so that they don't all talk about the same thing.

23
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,352
Secondly, the theme should be topical enough so that it resonates with our audience.

24
00:01:38,392 --> 00:01:41,834
So ideas like, how the rumble pack changed my life are probably a non-starter.

25
00:01:42,634 --> 00:01:45,417
And lastly, we want our themes to be affirming, inspirational even.

26
00:01:45,717 --> 00:01:49,320
Ideally, we'd like each of you to leave this session absolutely stoked to engage with this community.

27
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:52,503
With this in mind, I turned a bit introspective in search for an answer.

28
00:01:53,824 --> 00:01:56,306
What's something that's provocative enough to generate interesting ideas?

29
00:01:56,487 --> 00:01:58,508
What shared experiences would be worth exploring?

30
00:01:58,628 --> 00:02:00,610
And what challenges do we face as a community?

31
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:01,631
And you know what?

32
00:02:02,152 --> 00:02:05,294
One idea, one sentiment, kept bubbling up to the surface.

33
00:02:05,735 --> 00:02:08,677
And that was that this industry can be a real shit show sometimes.

34
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:16,101
which is not the theme of this year's Animation Microtalks, but I think it might be something that we can all relate to and have encountered at one time or another in our careers.

35
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:18,822
I know that I personally experienced this, and you know what?

36
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:20,082
It starts at the very beginning.

37
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:25,084
As a student, the barrier to entry into the industry felt almost insurmountable.

38
00:02:25,504 --> 00:02:32,507
Not only does it require thousands of hours of work to learn the craft and refine our skills, but it also has the added bonus of sometimes costing an ungodly amount of money as well.

39
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:37,309
Finding that first break is so vitally important, but the path to get there can be hard to navigate.

40
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:42,759
And once you do get your foot in the door, finding a job that values you as a person and artist can prove difficult.

41
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:49,922
Our passion for making video games is often used as a tool to overwork and underpay us, and it's easy to become jaded about the industry as a whole.

42
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:54,043
Layoffs, studio closures, cancelled projects, this field can be brutal.

43
00:02:54,683 --> 00:02:56,344
Not only that, but the job itself is hard.

44
00:02:56,504 --> 00:03:01,006
I've never once sat at my desk at the beginning of a project and thought to myself, well, this is going to be a piece of cake.

45
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:05,351
When people say every ship game is a miracle, man are they not kidding.

46
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:09,313
And as game developers, every day represents a new challenge that we have to overcome.

47
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:10,794
So why do we do it?

48
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:14,135
If it's that hard and that stressful, why would we put ourselves through it?

49
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:16,496
Because making video games is frickin' awesome.

50
00:03:16,937 --> 00:03:18,738
And honestly, I think we're an optimistic bunch.

51
00:03:19,238 --> 00:03:21,139
I think we have to be in order to be good at what we do.

52
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:26,822
In order to create something out of nothing, we have to have the ability to look forward and see the potential in ourselves and what we're creating.

53
00:03:27,722 --> 00:03:39,153
We have to have the unshakable belief in vision that allows us to be able to walk into a conference room, stand in front of some extremely important people, and say things like, I think a giant, uh, sentient space ape who eats peanut butter and shoots lightning should be the face of our game.

54
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:40,655
And then we have to defend it.

55
00:03:41,932 --> 00:03:43,594
We are a community of problem solvers.

56
00:03:43,754 --> 00:03:45,195
It's what we do day in and day out.

57
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:47,518
Challenges don't scare us, they excite us.

58
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:55,525
There's just this spark of joy that happens when you tinker with a problem for hours, if not days, and everything eventually clicks.

59
00:03:55,645 --> 00:03:57,507
Something ephemeral, but compelling.

60
00:03:58,632 --> 00:04:01,374
Those times when you delete a single frame and it fixes an entire shot.

61
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:05,657
Or when you hook up the right node in the blend tree and all of a sudden that one annoying pop disappears.

62
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:11,981
Even when you can't solve the problem on your own and have to turn to your colleagues for help, the collaborative problem solving involved can still be upon it's health.

63
00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:21,358
And it was this collective sense of optimism in the face of the trials and tribulations that are so deeply ingrained in our industry that eventually inspired the theme of these micro talks.

64
00:04:21,818 --> 00:04:26,281
Because if there's one thing I admire most about this community, it is the drive to make this industry better.

65
00:04:26,802 --> 00:04:29,724
To push boundaries and test limits and to always look towards a new horizon.

66
00:04:30,484 --> 00:04:37,031
Yep, New Horizon checked all the boxes, broad but directional, hopeful in tone, and left plenty of room to explore topics that would resonate with all of you.

67
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:41,356
We've recruited an incredibly talented panel of speakers for you this evening.

68
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:46,182
They come from all across the industry and more than likely have touched at least one or two of your favorite games.

69
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:48,803
and they put a ton of work into these talks.

70
00:04:49,203 --> 00:04:54,085
For only being about five minutes long, the microtalks are some of the most challenging of the Animation Summit, largely due to the format.

71
00:04:54,505 --> 00:04:59,226
Each speaker gets exactly 20 slides that auto-advance every 16 seconds to make their case.

72
00:04:59,627 --> 00:05:00,747
No more, no less.

73
00:05:02,688 --> 00:05:07,089
Timing, as always, is the most important thing that we do, and I know they're gonna knock it out of the park.

74
00:05:07,289 --> 00:05:14,572
I'm so excited for you folks to finally see what they've been working on, so please, sit back, relax, and enjoy the final session of the Animation Summit 2023.

75
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:20,707
Once again, my name is Brandon Nason.

76
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,132
These are the ways to contact me if you should feel so inclined.

77
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:28,057
Hey, everyone.

78
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:29,898
My talk is, Are You Not Entertained?

79
00:05:30,218 --> 00:05:33,819
How Flirtious Gags and Easter Eggs Benefit Players and Devs Alike.

80
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,439
I love finding Easter eggs in games.

81
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:39,141
I think it's because by their very nature, they're like a little gift you didn't know you were going to get.

82
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:41,921
But did you ever realize they can also be a gift to those that make them?

83
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:43,662
My name is Danish Syed.

84
00:05:43,822 --> 00:05:46,243
I'm a principal UI visual designer at Respawn Entertainment.

85
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:49,604
I have a pretty diverse background and degrees in computer science and animation.

86
00:05:50,024 --> 00:05:51,364
I've worked in film, TV, and games.

87
00:05:51,824 --> 00:05:56,586
And I always love finding new ways to entertain myself, which, as you'll see, is a pretty useful quality to have when making games.

88
00:05:58,336 --> 00:06:04,779
There's a great quote about development that says it's like playing chess against a formidable opponent, but where you have to commit to all your moves in advance.

89
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:13,982
I don't really remember who said it, but it stuck with me because it does a great job illustrating how difficult and complex it really is, and how much thought and planning is required.

90
00:06:16,403 --> 00:06:21,445
I think most developers would agree that we have dream jobs, but that doesn't mean we can't get buried under that which we love.

91
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,906
There's always a ton of work to do and not enough time to do it in.

92
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:27,368
And as we all know, art is never finished, only abandoned.

93
00:06:29,778 --> 00:06:32,901
We all want to polish our work to perfection, but often have to move on to the next task.

94
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:36,123
Yet, sometimes it's important to take a break and do something for yourself.

95
00:06:36,544 --> 00:06:37,565
Something pointless or silly.

96
00:06:37,645 --> 00:06:39,967
Something to give yourself a creative boost to make it through production.

97
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,588
There's lots of ways you can do this.

98
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:47,513
I'm going to cover a few methods I've used over the years to give myself a fun diversion and inject a little more life into the game along the way.

99
00:06:49,093 --> 00:06:51,214
The simplest and easiest is the flourish.

100
00:06:51,615 --> 00:06:58,519
Take an extra bit of polish, a fun addition, a small Easter egg, taking your task beyond what's necessary and doing something that gives you a real sense of satisfaction.

101
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:02,761
It's the kind of thing fans won't miss when it's not there, but will notice when it is.

102
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:07,624
For example, in Mortal Kombat 11, fighter customization was a key feature of the game.

103
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:11,306
In addition to full body outfits, each character could equip three pieces of gear.

104
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:18,711
I designed and choreographed unique animations for every gear piece for every character to not only highlight the item, but also express their personality and move set.

105
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:27,234
So when it came time to do the Joker, I thought it'd be funny if we broke the fourth wall and had the camera itself be afraid to approach the character.

106
00:07:27,754 --> 00:07:30,456
The Joker would then egg you on to get closer and scare you when he got close enough.

107
00:07:31,557 --> 00:07:33,059
And, of course, laugh at you for falling for it.

108
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:42,226
In another example, I wanted to treat his gear like an infomercial, where he's trying to sell you the item, complete with on-screen graphics.

109
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:47,622
New and improved Joker products, of course, a reference to the classic 1989 Batman film.

110
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:53,703
In both of these examples, I broke the template of what we were doing with other characters and tried to have a little extra fun.

111
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,004
Another example in MK11 were the friendships.

112
00:07:58,164 --> 00:08:01,425
I designed a lot of typography for the game, but for the friendships, I wanted to do something a little extra.

113
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:04,425
And something as fun and light-hearted as the animations themselves.

114
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:07,946
I even threw a little extra star if you get a flawless victory.

115
00:08:10,845 --> 00:08:12,687
The next method is a little bigger, the side mission.

116
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:16,470
A task that's maybe not part of your normal responsibilities, but something you really enjoy doing.

117
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,833
It could be something you might chip away at over a longer period of time between tasks.

118
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:22,716
Almost like a personal project, it just happens to be part of the game.

119
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:25,899
In my case, I have a background in motion graphics.

120
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:30,303
And my previous job was designing and animating title sequences for film and television.

121
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:35,147
So I never missed the chance to leverage those skills and craft some cool titles for a game.

122
00:08:36,445 --> 00:08:41,008
We could have easily shipped without it, but for me, it was really fun to do, and it was good for the game.

123
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:47,351
Finally, we have co-op mode, recruiting collaborators to grow your gag into something a little more ambitious.

124
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:51,154
It's basically feature creep, so use sparingly and be mindful of others' time.

125
00:08:51,594 --> 00:08:56,577
Now, the iconic handshake you see here is not just a visual metaphor for this category, it's literally what we did.

126
00:08:57,297 --> 00:09:05,122
The Predator was a guest fighter in MKX, and so I worked with a handful of other developers to put in an Easter egg that recreated the famous handshake.

127
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:09,146
You son of a bitch.

128
00:09:16,793 --> 00:09:22,217
The interesting thing about the handshake is that it opened the door for our characters to interact with each other on the select screen, something we hadn't done before.

129
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:25,941
We built on that for Injustice 2, having the entire system based around character interaction.

130
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:27,542
You can see our first prototype here.

131
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:30,925
Something that may not have happened had we not proved it out previously at MKX.

132
00:09:32,466 --> 00:09:33,407
And here you can see it in action.

133
00:09:33,826 --> 00:09:38,848
One character attacks and the other responds to the counterattack as we go into slow-mo, creating a cool visual tableau.

134
00:09:39,229 --> 00:09:46,192
Each character has a variety of attack types to keep things varied, an uppercut, a side hook, a chest strike, and each character would have all three animation reactions to play accordingly.

135
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:51,635
With this new template firmly established, we had time to have fun with it.

136
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:53,296
The flash was the perfect candidate.

137
00:09:53,976 --> 00:10:02,240
As the slow-mo kicks in, the flash enters the speed force, and we see him react to his slow deployment, a wonderful gag that has its roots all the way back to the Predator handshake in MKX.

138
00:10:06,141 --> 00:10:09,324
It's important to remember you don't want to inadvertently make things harder for your fellow developers.

139
00:10:09,764 --> 00:10:11,726
In the last example, everything was planned and approved.

140
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:15,669
As features begin to grow, you have to be aware of downstream effects in QA time.

141
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,492
Pick your moment and keep everybody in the loop, and don't creep.

142
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:20,333
Unless everybody's on the same page.

143
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:27,680
With all said and done, these little gifts to yourself will make it out into the real world, and players will notice no matter how small they are.

144
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,564
Even the tiniest details will spark joy in those that see them, and they'll want to share that joy with others.

145
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:37,408
Creating a game is a long road, the end of which can easily be lost over the horizon.

146
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:41,613
So we should do what we can to keep ourselves invested and engaged throughout.

147
00:10:42,414 --> 00:10:46,860
While you work hard to make fun for others, remember to make some fun for yourself.

148
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:48,282
Thanks.

149
00:10:55,011 --> 00:10:56,533
Hello, my name is Hayden Cooper.

150
00:10:56,874 --> 00:10:59,077
I've come from the world of ViewModel animation.

151
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:04,345
I'm here today to talk about why InSpec animations are one of the coolest things in ViewModel.

152
00:11:05,187 --> 00:11:08,291
So, tap your mags, push your forward assists, and strap in.

153
00:11:14,502 --> 00:11:15,363
What is an inspect?

154
00:11:16,283 --> 00:11:21,647
In the inspect is a V model animation in which the player is viewing their weapon in first person.

155
00:11:22,308 --> 00:11:26,091
They're able to see the details and mechanics of their weapon and all of their glory.

156
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:31,083
So what is ViewModel?

157
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:33,406
ViewModel is first person.

158
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:43,019
If it's hard to explain to your friends or family what you do as an animator, add on the extra layer of saying, I work with only hands and a weapon.

159
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,541
They're sure to understand.

160
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:49,178
The inspect is a nice-to-have animation.

161
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:57,351
It is not a necessary sequence in the same way that a reload, a draw, or a fire animation will fit into your gameplay design.

162
00:11:57,752 --> 00:11:59,956
It's not responding to a specific event.

163
00:12:02,344 --> 00:12:12,278
inspect animations are a really cool opportunity for us view model animators to step on stage and demonstrate our knowledge and skill by fiddling with all the bits and bobs on these weapons.

164
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,364
And it really helps to kind of show off the assets or tie the room together.

165
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:21,012
So why are inspects a thing now?

166
00:12:21,793 --> 00:12:26,898
I think they're situations for us to really define and set the mood.

167
00:12:27,218 --> 00:12:27,859
Pretty romantic.

168
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:34,385
In situations outside of gameplay where the player isn't just running around and shooting anything they see moving.

169
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,462
But not all InSpecs are made the same.

170
00:12:37,702 --> 00:12:40,564
There are three types of InSpecs that I'm recognizing.

171
00:12:40,884 --> 00:12:49,552
There are player-initiated ones, where a player presses with a hotkey, and there are extended idles, and smaller moments known as fidgets.

172
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:52,087
A player initiated inspect.

173
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:57,254
This is when the player presses a button to start the inspect and they have full agency to stop them.

174
00:12:58,095 --> 00:12:59,978
I'll say that these are more common nowadays.

175
00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:04,124
And depending on how fancy you can get, it can lead to some pretty cool gaming clips as you see here.

176
00:13:04,585 --> 00:13:05,286
This is me, by the way.

177
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,150
Next are extended idles.

178
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:22,693
These are incorporated near the end of the idle animation, and these can be just as flourishy as they are seen in older games where they didn't need a dedicated hotkey.

179
00:13:23,514 --> 00:13:34,096
Lastly are fidgets, which are smaller moments of readjusting the weapon that really show how heavy holding this weapon up can be, or after gripping it for so long, how sweaty they can get.

180
00:13:34,896 --> 00:13:38,321
So it's a little readjustment, just a little, sorry.

181
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:45,051
Majority of the time in a first person shooter, your attention isn't on the weapon, but it's on the battlefield.

182
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:49,142
You're scanning what's ahead of you and InSpecs are going to break that.

183
00:13:49,923 --> 00:13:52,124
By bringing the peripheral into your foreground.

184
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:54,285
Creating opportunities for acting.

185
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:58,447
Who is holding these objects and weapons will vary from game to game.

186
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,489
Some will be full of gritty, mil-sim operators.

187
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:07,071
Others can be rosters chock full of varied personalities with distinct characteristics.

188
00:14:07,771 --> 00:14:09,572
There's a lot of world building that can go into it.

189
00:14:11,092 --> 00:14:15,675
A grounded shooter is the perfect place to reflect shooting doctrines or training of that era.

190
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:23,742
Such as this example, the operator is pulling the slide back, doing a chamber check to ensure that this weapon is 100% loaded or unloaded.

191
00:14:26,804 --> 00:14:31,507
If the world you're building isn't as grounded and heavy as lead, you can get away with some pretty ridiculous stuff.

192
00:14:33,028 --> 00:14:33,709
As seen here.

193
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,833
Stuff like this shows the game will be a wild ride and full of fun.

194
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:45,025
Weapons and objects in your game are going to vary.

195
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:53,571
A pistol will feel lighter and snappy, while rifles like the sniper here are really going to feel the force that it takes to operate it.

196
00:14:54,732 --> 00:14:56,493
Also because it's good just to take another moment to see it.

197
00:14:59,252 --> 00:15:03,334
or maybe there are bits and pieces on a weapon that you've been looking at the entire time you've been playing.

198
00:15:04,374 --> 00:15:09,757
And so did the animator, who has worked on it for many, many hours.

199
00:15:10,557 --> 00:15:12,778
So perhaps you've thought about fiddling with this little bit.

200
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:28,992
Those tactile experiences are really important because the worlds and levels first-person shooters are in are set up in pretty rigid ways and for many different reasons, but I'll let level designers talk about that.

201
00:15:29,912 --> 00:15:33,474
So, InSpec animations really help flesh out the world that you're playing in.

202
00:15:34,294 --> 00:15:36,355
InSpecs as we know it haven't always been around.

203
00:15:37,055 --> 00:15:39,636
They've evolved to what they are because of weapon customization.

204
00:15:40,196 --> 00:15:45,698
Extended idles and fidgets are what have paved the way for player-initiated InSpecs that we have now.

205
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:49,201
Those InSpecs today are a work of art.

206
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:52,283
It is a showcase of a team's talent across disciplines.

207
00:15:52,804 --> 00:15:57,127
It's more than animation, it's modeling, it's audio, and it's visual effects.

208
00:15:57,667 --> 00:16:00,950
All of these are on stage performing together and going absolutely ham.

209
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:10,658
I'd argue that we are in a renaissance of view model animation, that these InSpecs in particular are the epitome and peak of the craft.

210
00:16:11,258 --> 00:16:14,561
I like to assume that we're just scratching the surface when it comes to this kind of stuff.

211
00:16:15,953 --> 00:16:19,957
So I just want to say thank you for letting me gush and ramble on about InSpecs today.

212
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:25,222
My name is Hayden, and I hope everyone here has a fantastic rest of their time at GDC.

213
00:16:25,522 --> 00:16:25,962
Take it easy.

214
00:16:30,226 --> 00:16:30,467
All right.

215
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:31,728
My name is Jean-Paul Reimuller.

216
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:40,096
I've been in the industry for about 13 years now, this year, three in film and the rest in game development.

217
00:16:41,188 --> 00:16:46,873
I'm an Associate Animation Director at Blizzard, currently working on Diablo 4 in Cinematics.

218
00:16:48,855 --> 00:16:58,383
It's easy for many folks who stay in this biz a long time to get stuck in their ways and can often dig their heels in instead of letting themselves learn, grow, and evolve in this ever-changing industry.

219
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,687
So I found an analogy with how we approach eating food with my son.

220
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:04,388
I know, makes perfect sense, right?

221
00:17:05,129 --> 00:17:11,415
We always ask our son to try a new food once before saying no, and this has led to him enjoying foods that he never thought he would.

222
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:12,736
It's called his no thank you bite.

223
00:17:13,437 --> 00:17:19,683
If he doesn't like it after that, then we don't need to push it on him, and at least he tried it, and now he knows whether he likes it or not.

224
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:25,055
Hopefully, that will help him make a more informed choice next time, right?

225
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:26,536
Seems simple, right?

226
00:17:27,617 --> 00:17:39,184
So if we as animators and artists can stay open to just trying something new once in a while instead of digging our heels in, just think about how much we can learn about ourselves and others while pushing into new horizons.

227
00:17:39,945 --> 00:17:44,448
Starting out in film, I always considered myself a high-functioning animation machine, right?

228
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:50,412
And my only real goals were to continue to grow my skill set and to take on whatever challenges were put in front of me.

229
00:17:52,757 --> 00:17:57,142
As I transitioned to game development after a few years, that notion was challenged for the first time.

230
00:17:57,202 --> 00:18:03,608
For the first time, I had to understand the functionality of what I was trying to create and how it fit into everybody else's idea of what works.

231
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:10,376
Not all individuals were concerned with the quality of my animations, but more how it felt and what the player experience was.

232
00:18:10,896 --> 00:18:13,678
I started to question my choices, my skill set, my goals.

233
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:19,602
I got real feedback about who I was as an individual collaborator and not just my skill set.

234
00:18:19,643 --> 00:18:20,263
So I questioned.

235
00:18:20,363 --> 00:18:22,244
Did I make the right choice to transition to games?

236
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,226
I also felt inspired at the same time.

237
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:25,907
So what the fuck is going on?

238
00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:28,869
I was getting opportunities, though.

239
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:33,212
Opportunities to take some bites out of something new that challenged this way of thinking.

240
00:18:33,593 --> 00:18:39,237
Challenges that at the same time felt like it was taking focus away from my goal to be this high-functioning animation machine.

241
00:18:40,845 --> 00:18:45,487
As my career went on and I worked on different projects, I began to take on more challenges.

242
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:49,989
Leading wasn't something I was initially hired to do, but it was presented as an opportunity.

243
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:55,352
I was scared shitless and many times I felt like I had no idea where to begin.

244
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:57,890
but I tried it.

245
00:18:58,892 --> 00:19:11,609
And even though the experiences I have had are not always what I intended them to be, I learned by just saying yes to something new from time to time allowed me to become a better collaborator, a better teammate, and ultimately a better developer.

246
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,759
It wasn't, isn't that what we all want?

247
00:19:16,459 --> 00:19:22,002
An environment where we can challenge ourselves, fail a ton, learn, and ultimately grow?

248
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:24,583
Doesn't this lead to success in many areas?

249
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:26,984
Well, not always the way that you would think.

250
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:35,287
Now, some of the areas where I have said, sure, I'll try that out, gave me opportunities to gather new perspectives and skills.

251
00:19:36,229 --> 00:19:42,935
but when it was over or near the end, it also helped me find out what I was really passionate about and where I ultimately wanted my career to go.

252
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:48,840
Transitioning to an art lead was one of the most rewarding moves I ever made.

253
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,141
Did I see it at the time?

254
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:51,502
Hell no.

255
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,565
It was nerve wracking and I just took a chance.

256
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:59,830
I was way outside of my norm and my comfort and I felt like I was failing all the time in the early stages.

257
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:07,218
But what I did realize is that with the support of my team, my leads, mentors, I was able to push past that on most days.

258
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:16,028
And I was able to hone in where I was needed in this role rather than force myself into areas that the team didn't need me or that would have overcomplicated things.

259
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:26,712
And at the end, when asked to be an art lead again, I was able to say no thank you with confidence and continue my journey where I knew I would be happy in, in animation.

260
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:32,954
Without those experiences, I would have never had that perspective and confidence in the next horizon.

261
00:20:33,614 --> 00:20:40,436
As our careers move on, I have found that opportunities are there, not all at once and not all the same, but they're there.

262
00:20:40,957 --> 00:20:45,178
The question is, will opportunities still be there if I don't take some of those bites?

263
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:59,704
Moving forward from here, how do we foster this simple concept within ourselves so we can help our co-workers, our family, you all, to try something new, to take that bite?

264
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:05,847
The perception that we can't change habits to help build opportunities can sometimes hold us back from pushing ourselves and others.

265
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:08,968
I've been coming to GDC for almost seven years.

266
00:21:09,088 --> 00:21:10,789
Look at all those faces, right?

267
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:13,610
And in the audience, look around you.

268
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,290
Some I met way back then, some I met just last night.

269
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:19,911
You will have shifts in your career that you may not be able to influence.

270
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:22,212
Company changes, project shifts, a pandemic.

271
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:31,174
If we can find those small bites though and say yes, even if it's just a few of them, you may walk away with a much different experience that you will have along the way.

272
00:21:31,534 --> 00:21:32,134
Look at my son.

273
00:21:32,674 --> 00:21:38,679
Now this week, GDC will give you plenty of opportunities to take a bite before saying, no thank you.

274
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:48,328
It is in those moments that I think about the excitement each year, the passion that I see here, and the challenges that everyone faces when I discover that I'm not alone.

275
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:56,094
It gives me courage to go back to my studio to challenge myself and my team to continue to push towards those new horizons.

276
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,556
I'm John Paul Ryan Miller, Associate Animation Director at Blizzard.

277
00:21:59,616 --> 00:22:03,318
Stay engaged, stay connected, thanks for listening, and I'll see you in Sanctuary.

278
00:22:09,081 --> 00:22:14,244
Hi, my name is Yuna, and I'm here to talk about existing productively and professionally on the internet.

279
00:22:14,764 --> 00:22:17,425
So we're going to open this one with some audience participation.

280
00:22:17,866 --> 00:22:23,248
Raise your hand if you've ever felt that horrible cringe of seeing an old post that you made two or ten years ago on the internet.

281
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:26,230
Feels pretty good, right?

282
00:22:26,883 --> 00:22:30,484
So for my first GDC, my teachers told us to print physical business cards.

283
00:22:30,944 --> 00:22:37,426
So imagine my surprise when people asked for my Twitter handle instead, and that being online seemed like a social requirement for the industry.

284
00:22:37,906 --> 00:22:41,627
However, I'll now list what scared me about putting myself online.

285
00:22:42,848 --> 00:22:43,608
I'm an introvert.

286
00:22:43,728 --> 00:22:45,928
Going on the internet means being perceived.

287
00:22:46,389 --> 00:22:50,730
People could be mean to me, and I can have the emotional fortitude of a newborn puppy.

288
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,133
People I admire and potential employers, they would find me and they would judge me.

289
00:22:59,034 --> 00:23:00,715
So how did I start putting myself out there?

290
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:05,898
Well, as someone looking to break into the industry in 2018, this was the only thing I could do.

291
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:12,502
So to give myself the courage to start, I came up with a structure for curating a more professional online presence.

292
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:21,892
This was a chart I saw as a student and my instructors told us that people like working with these people way more than those people.

293
00:23:22,712 --> 00:23:30,116
I wanted to telegraph myself online to be around here with a healthy dose of kid who's got lots of spunk and lots of potential.

294
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:41,204
So, for me that wasn't quite specific enough to get started, so I made this Venn diagram to spark some positive introspection and to define the pillars of my desired online presence.

295
00:23:41,724 --> 00:23:46,688
I decided I wanted to present a good work ethic, that I learn quickly, and that I'm passionate about animation.

296
00:23:48,516 --> 00:23:52,760
And at the time my content strategy mostly hinged on the Anim State Discord and on Twitter.

297
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:57,384
Now, some stuff about Twitter has changed since the year I started using it.

298
00:23:58,065 --> 00:24:02,930
I'm not going to talk about that stuff, but take the Twitter-specific language I use with a grain of salt.

299
00:24:03,471 --> 00:24:06,393
So, how did I communicate my pillars on Twitter?

300
00:24:07,054 --> 00:24:10,797
First, I almost exclusively posted work in progress threads of personal work.

301
00:24:11,237 --> 00:24:20,943
This was super scary, especially when using industry hashtags for more views, but they showed the game dev community my work ethic, that I could learn quickly, and that I could take and implement feedback.

302
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:25,366
Second, I kept it professional and engaged only with industry-related content.

303
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:28,609
And third, I tried to keep my tone professional and kind.

304
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:32,831
Being a dick on the internet gets you nowhere, especially in a small industry like ours.

305
00:24:34,152 --> 00:24:39,436
I also jumped into the AnimState Discord at around the same time and I mostly kept my rules of engagement the same.

306
00:24:39,996 --> 00:24:54,305
The strength of AnimState is in the direct accessibility to professionals and the sheer concentration of industry knowledge, so I was mostly active in the feedback channel to practice asking for feedback and to practice giving constructively critical and actionable feedback to others.

307
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:06,733
My biggest rule was to treat everyone on the server like a teacher and potential co-worker, and now an enormous part of my early success was rooted in taking online animation courses.

308
00:25:07,194 --> 00:25:14,136
I didn't go to art school, I got my undergrad degree in biochemistry, and I actually took the MCAT before deciding on a slightly different career path.

309
00:25:14,777 --> 00:25:25,781
These online courses were how I learned animation, and a lot of my social media posts were actually class assignment progressions, so these classes gave me both the structure to learn animation and content for my online job-seeking presence.

310
00:25:26,461 --> 00:25:28,603
I genuinely can't recommend these classes enough.

311
00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:36,248
Not only were my instructors incredible teachers, but being coached by industry veterans on how to specifically better present myself was invaluable.

312
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:45,654
So now, five years later, I've gotten jobs, I've been able to grow my industry community, so now I mostly use the internet to post pictures of my cats.

313
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:55,681
So what worked for me may not work for you, and I'll leave both current job seekers and industry professionals with some suggestions about connecting online.

314
00:25:56,942 --> 00:26:00,664
So to job seekers, do your research.

315
00:26:00,804 --> 00:26:03,625
Have someone's details correct before you ask for their time and attention.

316
00:26:04,726 --> 00:26:09,689
Do make the effort to come up with specific questions and make it easier for us to help you.

317
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:11,670
Do be excited.

318
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,072
We all love animation and games and so we're starting from common ground.

319
00:26:16,232 --> 00:26:18,153
Don't assume the worst if you don't hear back.

320
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:19,474
People are busy.

321
00:26:20,335 --> 00:26:22,816
And don't be a dick if you don't get what you want.

322
00:26:23,056 --> 00:26:23,877
People are busy.

323
00:26:26,114 --> 00:26:32,982
and to the professionals out there, do take the time to respond, especially if you recognize genuine effort.

324
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:39,950
When I was starting out, I had absolutely no clue how to learn about the industry except for cold emailing folks.

325
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:45,873
and the pros who made time for me back then were able to steer me in the correct direction and that turns out pretty well.

326
00:26:46,293 --> 00:26:46,714
Here I am.

327
00:26:48,595 --> 00:26:50,176
So you all know who you are.

328
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:50,996
Thank you so much.

329
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,437
And just also don't be a dick.

330
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:59,821
Absolutely nothing comes out of discouraging the future talent of our industry and they could be your coworkers tomorrow.

331
00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:08,406
So in conclusion, just on the internet, be thoughtful, have fun, and don't be a dick.

332
00:27:10,287 --> 00:27:11,429
that is my talk.

333
00:27:16,295 --> 00:27:16,655
All right.

334
00:27:17,256 --> 00:27:18,057
Hello, everyone.

335
00:27:18,658 --> 00:27:19,920
My name is Emily Katzke.

336
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:22,023
I'm an animation lead at Bungie.

337
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:25,007
And I have a confession for you all today.

338
00:27:27,805 --> 00:27:29,246
I sit at my desk like a pretzel.

339
00:27:29,727 --> 00:27:32,169
I know, I know, it's terrible.

340
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:38,575
For those of you who are 30 and under, you may or may not understand the full weight of that confession.

341
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:43,779
But for those of you who are 30 and over, I know you get how bad that is.

342
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,002
Y'all just felt a chill run down your spine, okay?

343
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:55,065
Now, truthfully, I have had this problem since as long as I can remember sitting at a desk.

344
00:27:55,626 --> 00:28:01,029
I was never taught proper desk posture, and even if it was mentioned in passing, I never took it seriously.

345
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:07,733
I remember these pains starting as early as high school and getting worse and worse as I made sitting at a desk my job.

346
00:28:08,314 --> 00:28:11,396
Now, I have tried so many things to fix my posture.

347
00:28:11,896 --> 00:28:16,379
I have tried those elastic bands that you put your arms through and they tighten, and they're supposed to get you to sit upright.

348
00:28:17,284 --> 00:28:19,205
In reality, they just pinch your armpits.

349
00:28:20,306 --> 00:28:27,530
I have also tried that, like, buzzer necklace thing that you put on your back, and it's just a buzz to remind you to sit upright.

350
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:35,435
In reality, it just makes you feel bad every two minutes out of your eight-hour workday, every day.

351
00:28:36,936 --> 00:28:44,961
And then finally, I tried just good old-fashioned working out your back and your core muscles to have the strength and stamina to sit upright.

352
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:51,708
In reality, I just had my typical desk pains with the added post-workout soreness on top.

353
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:56,873
Now, I know I am not the only one with this problem.

354
00:28:57,873 --> 00:28:59,935
I have seen you shrimpies out there.

355
00:29:01,276 --> 00:29:02,417
I have seen the goblins.

356
00:29:03,478 --> 00:29:06,580
I've seen whatever this thing is.

357
00:29:06,861 --> 00:29:10,423
My point is, I am not the only one, okay?

358
00:29:11,573 --> 00:29:14,495
Now, I am not here to fix our posture, obviously.

359
00:29:15,275 --> 00:29:22,359
But what I am here to do is to tell you how I completely eradicated my desk pains, and that is through stretching.

360
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:24,960
Now, I'm going to ask for some audience participation.

361
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,762
I'm going to need all of you to stand on up.

362
00:29:28,442 --> 00:29:31,304
Put yourself down and stand up, and we're going to stretch together.

363
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:33,325
Let's do this.

364
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:34,166
All right, y'all.

365
00:29:35,091 --> 00:29:38,552
So, what you're gonna do is stand with your feet shoulder width apart.

366
00:29:39,372 --> 00:29:42,153
You're gonna have your back straight, your shoulders down.

367
00:29:42,813 --> 00:29:45,114
You're gonna make sure you're mindful of your neighbors.

368
00:29:45,154 --> 00:29:48,114
I know it's packed in tight, but you should be good to go, okay?

369
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:49,615
You're gonna keep your shoulders down.

370
00:29:50,575 --> 00:29:52,675
And then, you are gonna be mindful of your own body.

371
00:29:53,036 --> 00:29:55,956
If you feel any pain or discomfort, please stop, okay?

372
00:29:56,356 --> 00:29:56,756
Be smart.

373
00:29:57,377 --> 00:30:00,957
So, we're gonna start with good old-fashioned wrist stretches.

374
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:02,218
You're gonna put your right arm out,

375
00:30:03,098 --> 00:30:03,519
talk about

376
00:30:19,204 --> 00:30:20,505
make it good, and relax.

377
00:30:21,145 --> 00:30:22,185
All right, we're gonna do your left arm.

378
00:30:22,626 --> 00:30:28,968
Same thing, left arm out, palm up, grab your fingertips, and pull back and down towards your arm, and relax.

379
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:37,752
Left arm out, palm down, grab at your knuckles this time, and pull, this is the last stretch, make it good, and relax, shake it out, shake it out.

380
00:30:38,593 --> 00:30:45,156
Okay, so next up, we're gonna do back stretches, just a good old fashioned, stand up straight, you're gonna put your arms out in front of you,

381
00:30:46,192 --> 00:30:50,194
grab one hand with the other, and then you're going to reach out and all the way up.

382
00:30:51,334 --> 00:30:51,814
Make it good.

383
00:30:51,974 --> 00:30:54,275
I think about going like behind my head a little bit.

384
00:30:54,575 --> 00:30:55,536
Put your back into it.

385
00:30:56,136 --> 00:30:56,736
One more.

386
00:30:57,697 --> 00:30:58,337
And relax.

387
00:30:59,337 --> 00:31:00,558
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out.

388
00:31:01,587 --> 00:31:05,889
Okay, I'm going to talk you through this last one, and then we're going to do it, so just hear me out.

389
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,191
The next thing we're going to do are neck rolls.

390
00:31:08,731 --> 00:31:13,413
Your head is a nine-pound bowling ball, and we're going to make it do all the work for you, okay?

391
00:31:13,633 --> 00:31:23,199
So you're going to think about sitting up straight, keeping your shoulders down, and what we're going to do is drop our head forward, roll to the right, back, left, forward, left, back, right, forward, deep breath in.

392
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:25,100
and we're done, okay?

393
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
So, let's do this.

394
00:31:26,941 --> 00:31:42,969
Stand up straight, shoulders down, drop your head forward and slowly roll to the right, to the back, to the left, and forward, and back to the left, to the back, to the right, and forward.

395
00:31:42,989 --> 00:31:46,571
You're going to take a deep breath in, sit up straight, and exhale.

396
00:31:47,563 --> 00:31:47,603
on

397
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:14,305
So what you're going to do is follow me on Twitter if you like this because I'm going to post so much more there because I feel so passionately about how this changed my life.

398
00:32:15,326 --> 00:32:18,668
I'm talking desk stretches that you can do at work and people won't stare at you funny.

399
00:32:18,968 --> 00:32:25,253
I'm talking full body stretches that you can do at your home, the gym, anything that involves a little much for work.

400
00:32:25,513 --> 00:32:27,294
And I'm even going to do targeted stretches.

401
00:32:27,334 --> 00:32:32,057
So if you're like, I just care about my neck or my wrists or my lower back, it's all going to be there.

402
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:34,679
So thank you all so much.

403
00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:35,820
And frankly,

404
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,441
I hope these stretches help you as much as they've helped me.

405
00:32:42,103 --> 00:32:43,784
Hello, my name is Josiah Haworth.

406
00:32:43,824 --> 00:32:50,147
I've been a game developer for around eight years and I am currently a senior animator at Riot Games working on the first-person shooter Valorant.

407
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:58,231
And I have traveled all the way from Los Angeles, California for my very first GDC to tell you all that I am an idiot.

408
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:00,912
Don't laugh too hard.

409
00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:10,709
But in all seriousness, I would like to share a personal journey that led me to game development and hopefully help you avoid the pitfalls that I fell into.

410
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:27,018
But in order to do that, we're going to need to take a step back and get a broader view of my mistakes and how I spent almost six years of my life chasing a job in film when I should have realized where my heart truly resided.

411
00:33:28,755 --> 00:33:37,641
In storytelling, a hero's journey is usually initiated with a call to action that forces or convinces the character to embark on an adventure.

412
00:33:38,402 --> 00:33:46,188
During this journey, the character conflict often arises when a character's wants are misaligned with what they actually need to grow.

413
00:33:46,688 --> 00:33:48,289
We see this a lot in animated films.

414
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:54,414
In Kung Fu Panda, Po wants to fight like one of the five masters, but what he really needs is to embrace his own unique fighting style.

415
00:33:55,413 --> 00:34:00,920
In Princess and the Frog, Prince David wants to marry rich and live the high life, but what he really needs is to find true love.

416
00:34:02,403 --> 00:34:05,725
And just like those characters, it took me a while before I realized what I really needed.

417
00:34:06,246 --> 00:34:09,328
Growing up, I wasn't obsessed with the Godfather or the latest Spielberg movie.

418
00:34:09,688 --> 00:34:18,175
I was obsessed with trying to figure out how to catch the secret Mew in Pokemon Red and Blue, or chasing down rumors on how to get the Triforce of Power in Ocarina of Time.

419
00:34:18,795 --> 00:34:20,016
But animation captivated me.

420
00:34:20,356 --> 00:34:26,401
And after watching a DVD of The Incredibles at my retail job for the 100th time, I decided I wanted to animate for a living.

421
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:30,584
However, it never dawned on me that games needed to have animations.

422
00:34:31,462 --> 00:34:32,483
Like I said, not the brightest.

423
00:34:34,484 --> 00:34:38,167
I applied for the animation program, but was only accepted into the game art major.

424
00:34:38,547 --> 00:34:39,648
This was my first hint.

425
00:34:40,388 --> 00:34:46,072
However, after accepting, instead of taking the hint, I was actually disappointed and felt that I had failed.

426
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:51,876
For a brief moment, I was actually on the right track, until a spot opened up and I switched majors to animation.

427
00:34:52,597 --> 00:35:00,903
All through college, while others were using their free time polishing up their filmmaking skills, I always spent mine playing Team Fortress 2 and hosting Enemies of the Dark Descent Horror Nights in my dorm.

428
00:35:02,816 --> 00:35:06,257
I was studying film, but I spent all my free time playing video games.

429
00:35:07,237 --> 00:35:10,918
After graduation, my first job was at an AR company that wanted to make their own games.

430
00:35:11,098 --> 00:35:16,419
It wasn't a film, but I thought I could potentially use it as a stepping stone towards feature animation.

431
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,181
I continued to have near misses with game development until I got a call back from Blizzard Entertainment.

432
00:35:22,041 --> 00:35:23,501
And I cannot stress this enough.

433
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:30,383
I am so foolish that even after joining Blizzard, my main goal was to use it as a point on my resume to go into feature.

434
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:36,972
But my time there changed me, surrounded by the most talented, kind, and thoughtful people I had ever met in my career.

435
00:35:37,612 --> 00:35:39,053
People that I had so much in common with.

436
00:35:39,773 --> 00:35:43,855
I resonated with my co-workers, and now fellow devs, in a way I had not experienced before.

437
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:48,978
We talked similarly, we could have long conversations about games we found and what we hoped to make.

438
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:53,501
And from this, my heart began to truly open to game development, and I began to learn.

439
00:35:54,397 --> 00:35:58,259
From World of Warcraft, I learned that technical restrictions breed innovation and critical thinking.

440
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:05,524
It taught me that keeping the goals and limitations of a project in mind, and how to work within them to get the best performance possible.

441
00:36:06,124 --> 00:36:08,626
And most importantly, that ideas in animation are king.

442
00:36:09,886 --> 00:36:12,908
From Overwatch, I learned that with great power comes great responsibility.

443
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:19,572
In a system and game where everything is possible, keeping the game design and scope in mind was key to success.

444
00:36:19,812 --> 00:36:24,095
It taught me restraint, but also had to mesh character fantasy with their ability to design.

445
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:32,765
And since Valorant was my first launch title, I learned how gritty and organic the pre-launch period can be.

446
00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:38,468
How trust and empathy are vital at such a formative stage of the development cycle.

447
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:43,052
And also how to take tight game design restrictions and infuse it with character fantasy.

448
00:36:43,857 --> 00:36:48,021
and slowly but surely the bubble of stupidity surrounding me broke down.

449
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:56,549
It took almost 10 years to realize that what I really needed and was truly hungering for was to be part of making the games that I enjoyed so much.

450
00:36:58,442 --> 00:37:00,885
Game development is a beautiful collaborative mess.

451
00:37:01,626 --> 00:37:14,220
It is truly a job where teams are stronger together, where collaboration and mutual respect are key to success, and where the goal is for every craft to plus the work that was put before it, all in service of the player.

452
00:37:15,478 --> 00:37:22,400
Nothing beats the feeling of having players notice that little extra touch you add to the game, because those are the moments that I remember when gaming.

453
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:29,281
And being able to do that for others has made me realize more and more that working in games is what I needed all along.

454
00:37:30,602 --> 00:37:33,422
But please, I'm begging you, learn from my stupidity.

455
00:37:34,282 --> 00:37:38,603
Don't dismiss an opportunity out of hand simply because it may not tick all of your boxes.

456
00:37:39,324 --> 00:37:44,965
Don't lock yourself into working on a specific project, or a specific studio, or even a specific game type.

457
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:52,395
Not every job can give you what you want, but you can learn things that you need from every project.

458
00:37:53,195 --> 00:38:02,123
It's been some time since I realized that being a game developer is what I needed, but seeing players be surprised and delighted by the work that I do only strengthens my love for games.

459
00:38:08,146 --> 00:38:08,987
My name is Ryan Duffin.

460
00:38:09,047 --> 00:38:10,909
I'm the animation director at Undead Labs.

461
00:38:11,009 --> 00:38:15,394
When I was asked to sub in for another speaker, I started thinking about the zeitgeist of 2023.

462
00:38:16,135 --> 00:38:19,298
Two things jumped out at me, AI and feedback culture.

463
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:22,722
Brandon told me the talk should be uplifting and inspiring.

464
00:38:22,782 --> 00:38:25,184
And I was like, yeah, you got it.

465
00:38:25,244 --> 00:38:25,605
No problem.

466
00:38:27,904 --> 00:38:33,747
So in flip-flopping between the two and my own non-committal nature, I found a common thread, so I'm going to try and squeeze in both.

467
00:38:34,487 --> 00:38:35,768
Here's the real title of my talk.

468
00:38:35,848 --> 00:38:36,888
The first one is bait.

469
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:39,750
It's worth mentioning that I'm not an AI expert.

470
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,732
If I say anything insightful here, it's regurgitated from people who are smarter than me.

471
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:51,396
However, the removal of the need for human expertise is thematically appropriate when we're talking about AI, because it makes no secret about that trajectory.

472
00:38:51,797 --> 00:39:00,862
The discourse among professionals and professional creatives seems to be either angry shouting that this shouldn't exist, or casual acceptance that it's just another tool on the inevitable march of progress.

473
00:39:01,323 --> 00:39:03,144
Whether you think it should exist or not, it does.

474
00:39:03,584 --> 00:39:04,805
And yes, it's no secret.

475
00:39:05,465 --> 00:39:06,626
It's a tool, but it advocates

476
00:39:07,273 --> 00:39:12,594
Its advocates have made no secret that democratizing is a nice-sounding word for cutting out expensive experts like us.

477
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:17,115
Six months ago, some of these mid-journey prompts might have been paid artist work.

478
00:39:17,935 --> 00:39:28,417
AI advocates freely admit that with potential comes threat, but for game dev, we also need to consider testing, so the machine doesn't fill our games with dicks in Hitler, and the legality of training models is still in question.

479
00:39:28,497 --> 00:39:32,378
We can't ship things we can't verify the source of, and AI can be cagey about sources.

480
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:37,000
And I don't want to be the woke police here, but every human that MidJourney produces is pretty hot.

481
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:38,841
Nobody's average, nobody's ugly.

482
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,322
Unattractive means not a model.

483
00:39:40,602 --> 00:39:42,343
Apparently stockbroker means bodybuilder.

484
00:39:43,504 --> 00:39:44,625
These are two prompts I fetted.

485
00:39:44,685 --> 00:39:46,646
I did not specify white or male.

486
00:39:47,026 --> 00:39:49,687
Whatever your thoughts on diversity, that's a blind spot to reality.

487
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:52,009
It's just a tool is pacifying language.

488
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:55,691
You have to remember that not every tool is created with ethics or consequences in mind.

489
00:39:56,211 --> 00:39:57,872
Some tools change the course of human history.

490
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,653
Some tools destroy entire industries.

491
00:40:00,051 --> 00:40:01,971
It is a tool, and I'm not saying it's one of these.

492
00:40:02,532 --> 00:40:03,292
Only time will tell.

493
00:40:04,672 --> 00:40:07,172
That bait title was generated by chat GPT.

494
00:40:07,653 --> 00:40:13,074
To anyone who buys or sells the self-aggrandizing bullshit of some of these conference talks names, this is fucking gold.

495
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:16,734
And it makes me wonder, is it the machines that are impersonating us?

496
00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:20,835
The scary thing is that AI regurgitates things that exist in novel ways.

497
00:40:20,935 --> 00:40:23,856
And that shouldn't be scary to a room full of creatives, but it is.

498
00:40:24,335 --> 00:40:30,200
In AAA, we creators, through our mergers and market research, organize media into formulas and tropes that are predictable and reproducible.

499
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:37,286
Even if AI is just some kind of fancy auto-complete, how many of our interactions or entertainment really challenges our feelings or emotions?

500
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:40,168
Games can be beautiful, fresh and original, but a lot aren't.

501
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:44,732
We're up to our eyeballs in retreads and clones, dosing us up with enough dopamine to not notice.

502
00:40:45,012 --> 00:40:46,913
Of course we're at risk of being replaced.

503
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:50,616
We make ourselves replaceable when our entertainment is banal and derivative.

504
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,619
AI is creating content, AI-created content is here,

505
00:40:55,342 --> 00:40:57,284
and the lowest hanging fruit is junk food.

506
00:40:58,264 --> 00:41:01,847
Are you saying pretentious artsy fartsiness is the only way to save our industry?

507
00:41:02,448 --> 00:41:04,950
Not everything we want to consume needs to push or provoke us.

508
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,611
That's fine.

509
00:41:05,731 --> 00:41:06,832
Tropes exist for a reason.

510
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:10,414
Sometimes you just want a cheeseburger and a lot of us are cheeseburger makers.

511
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:13,917
The robots are going to figure out cheeseburgers before they figure out duck pate.

512
00:41:14,858 --> 00:41:20,060
The advantage we meat sacks still have over the machine is we can imagine, we can critique, and mindfully iterate.

513
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,681
AI can produce, but it cannot judge and it cannot feel.

514
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:28,463
Great art can move us, but we can't make things great if we can't talk about them critically.

515
00:41:30,124 --> 00:41:33,325
Maybe you've heard the term toxic positivity, but you've definitely experienced it.

516
00:41:33,345 --> 00:41:36,106
It's a pretty simple concept, the idea that a positive attitude is everything.

517
00:41:36,526 --> 00:41:39,907
Don't point out problems if you don't have the solutions, and silence all negativity.

518
00:41:40,187 --> 00:41:42,428
And to some people, any critique sounds like negativity.

519
00:41:45,131 --> 00:41:47,252
I was down on time to drink in these, so.

520
00:41:47,292 --> 00:41:49,574
Does this make sense in a professional environment?

521
00:41:49,614 --> 00:41:57,458
We're lucky in games that lying to ourselves and each other, when something's bad it just means delays, cancellations, layoffs, or mediocre games.

522
00:41:57,739 --> 00:42:00,000
Would you take a cruise or a flight that's managed this way?

523
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:02,181
Do you want a pilot that doesn't want to hear about the engine fire?

524
00:42:03,262 --> 00:42:08,645
Positive attitudes have become a sort of prayer, but they don't cure cancer, climb mountains, put out fires, or plug holes in ships.

525
00:42:08,725 --> 00:42:10,887
And there's quite a bit of evidence that suggests the opposite.

526
00:42:11,227 --> 00:42:13,088
They can make us totally oblivious to our problems.

527
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:16,392
this lack of self-awareness isn't so different than the AI.

528
00:42:18,094 --> 00:42:25,400
Artists and animators learn critical analysis as part of our trade, but game dev culture is having a harder time with this type of communication as our industry matures.

529
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,105
It's largely on us, the creatives, to help lead people toward a culture of constructive feedback.

530
00:42:31,485 --> 00:42:34,848
To make things good or great, we need to be honest about the fact that they're not there yet.

531
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:38,951
Of course, open feedback is not an excuse to be aggressive, mean, or disrespectful.

532
00:42:39,192 --> 00:42:40,833
We criticize the work, not the worker.

533
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:51,137
You've maybe heard the term radical candor, usually in the context of someone making excuses for being an asshole, but it's definitely, it's defined as saying what you think while giving a damn about the person you're saying it to.

534
00:42:51,897 --> 00:42:58,681
A life-changing concept for me was when Brene Brown explained the difference between guilt and shame as what I've done versus what I am.

535
00:42:59,162 --> 00:43:01,403
Every animator in this room has made a bad animation.

536
00:43:01,683 --> 00:43:02,144
It's fine.

537
00:43:02,384 --> 00:43:03,124
It's how we get better.

538
00:43:03,204 --> 00:43:05,205
We're professionals because we make more good ones.

539
00:43:05,646 --> 00:43:07,267
Despite all effort to monetize

540
00:43:08,143 --> 00:43:10,085
Sorry, this is a last minute talk.

541
00:43:10,786 --> 00:43:14,229
Despite all effort to structure, produce, and monetize, we are still a creative industry.

542
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:20,075
If we're going to compete with this new technology, we're going to need to double down on the things that make us and our work human.

543
00:43:20,356 --> 00:43:22,438
Creativity, passion, self-awareness.

544
00:43:22,478 --> 00:43:25,020
The opposite of love is not hate, it's apathy.

545
00:43:25,741 --> 00:43:28,244
People who speak honestly about problems still care.

546
00:43:28,624 --> 00:43:30,286
They're invested in making things better.

547
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:35,433
Now more than ever, we need to embrace the tools we humans have that these new technologies do not.

548
00:43:35,774 --> 00:43:39,877
Computers don't know what is good, what is great, what is appealing, moving, or meaningful.

549
00:43:40,297 --> 00:43:41,138
That's what we're for.

550
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:46,462
To do that, we have to push ourselves harder to be better, and we have to be honest with ourselves and each other when we're not.

551
00:43:46,802 --> 00:43:50,064
If this talk didn't suck, it's because I have good friends who gave me good feedback.

552
00:43:50,245 --> 00:43:50,505
Thank you.

553
00:44:02,162 --> 00:44:06,663
So, unfortunately we had two speakers that had to bow out last week, last minute.

554
00:44:07,183 --> 00:44:11,864
Silver lining of that, though, is that we get to close out with another musical number.

555
00:44:11,884 --> 00:44:28,269
Yeah, so, okay, so the talk, I was a substitute, JP was as well, and he was dignified enough to not complain about it like me.

556
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:33,328
So yeah, it was I think in February.

557
00:44:33,968 --> 00:44:36,009
And I was really busy.

558
00:44:36,109 --> 00:44:39,251
And even like a week afterwards, I was like, do you really need me to do this?

559
00:44:39,271 --> 00:44:41,171
Because I'd rather work on my car.

560
00:44:42,032 --> 00:44:44,053
And I was told yes.

561
00:44:44,313 --> 00:44:45,754
And so I went for it.

562
00:44:45,814 --> 00:44:53,437
But then as I was stressed out and finishing the talk and all that, I thought it'd be funny because we did a song the last time we were here.

563
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,418
I was like, I'll have Chad GPT write a song.

564
00:44:57,967 --> 00:44:59,990
And it was okay, like it was an okay song.

565
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,534
And I'll try to keep the story, the short version.

566
00:45:03,594 --> 00:45:05,737
And if you're at the bar later, I'll tell you the long version.

567
00:45:05,837 --> 00:45:09,441
But here's what I have in my notes to describe this.

568
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:15,389
So after GDC 2018, Mike, wherever you are, I don't know where you are.

569
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:23,094
Anyway, Mike Jungbluth said, you should do a musical microtalk.

570
00:45:23,134 --> 00:45:24,854
And I said, OK, but only if Landa does it too.

571
00:45:24,894 --> 00:45:26,875
We wrote a song called One Keyframe at a Time.

572
00:45:26,895 --> 00:45:29,335
We played it at GDC 2019 as a surprise.

573
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:34,576
I don't think we're going to top that, but I've been thinking about doing another one since.

574
00:45:35,436 --> 00:45:39,557
So I had ChatGPT write one about how it's going to steal our jobs.

575
00:45:39,597 --> 00:45:42,297
And it did, and it was OK, but I thought maybe I could do better.

576
00:45:42,977 --> 00:45:45,938
First, I was trying to edit it into something, and then I just wound up shit canning the whole thing.

577
00:45:46,417 --> 00:45:47,137
writing something different.

578
00:45:47,417 --> 00:45:51,959
That was on Wednesday and I finished it on Friday.

579
00:45:52,960 --> 00:46:00,143
I think on Thursday night I messaged Brandon and I said about 70 percent chance of this happening and then it happened.

580
00:46:00,263 --> 00:46:05,926
So the video you're going to see here was done by on Saturday lunch.

581
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:10,428
Simon Unger is supposed to be here unfortunately he couldn't be but he was going to be second guitar.

582
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:13,569
Can we get it a little louder?

583
00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:14,830
Thanks.

584
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:15,850
Or a lot louder?

585
00:47:25,016 --> 00:47:27,854
They say they democratize but they

586
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:20,291
It can take a famous face and put it somewhere compromised It'll take a politician, fill their mouths with different lies A coalition forced to hell, also will have more junk to sell

587
00:48:46,414 --> 00:48:46,655
Hello.

588
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:31,432
Sorry for the technical difficulties
