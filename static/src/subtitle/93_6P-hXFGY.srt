00:00:05,914 --> 00:00:12,519
Welcome to killer portfolio or portfolio killer. My name is Allison. And um I want to see you guys

2
00:00:12,539 --> 00:00:16,462
get excited. This is going to be an awesome day. So let's hear make some noise for this.

3
00:00:16,482 --> 00:00:28,292
All right. I think so too. I didn't hear that. I need a little more. Come on. A little more.

4
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:35,017
Okay. So there's a couple of comments. A, please turn off your phones.

5
00:00:36,517 --> 00:00:39,560
Any question you guys want to ask, please ask.

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,662
So when I'll give you a signal to start lining up

7
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:44,963
and we will answer all the questions.

8
00:00:45,464 --> 00:00:47,806
The other thing after the panel, we go to the room

9
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:51,288
for the portfolio review and it is we take great pride in this

10
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,269
but we see every single student.

11
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,551
So I know the line gets really long

12
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:57,372
but we will see all of you.

13
00:00:57,392 --> 00:00:59,354
Okay.

14
00:00:59,374 --> 00:01:02,836
All right.

15
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:05,398
So I think we should do some introductions.

16
00:01:06,782 --> 00:01:07,202
Moby?

17
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:07,902
Yes.

18
00:01:08,963 --> 00:01:10,764
Guys, my name is Moby Frankie.

19
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:14,647
I graduate, actually, ironically, from the Academy of Art here in San Francisco.

20
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:17,629
I was an illustrator, fine art major.

21
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,512
I had no aspirations of getting into video games at the time.

22
00:01:22,032 --> 00:01:27,016
That was something that I was more into, you know, the fine art and illustration aspect.

23
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,887
I wanted to get into Pixar at one point.

24
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:32,668
You know, that didn't happen.

25
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:33,368
It's OK.

26
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:35,490
I luckily happened along.

27
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,272
I had a friend from art school that got me into Valve,

28
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:39,892
ironically.

29
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:42,754
That was my first real job in the industry.

30
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:44,534
I didn't take that for granted.

31
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:45,735
I was there for 11 years.

32
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:49,037
And now I work at Riot Games.

33
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:50,818
And it's a fantastic job.

34
00:01:51,098 --> 00:01:51,798
That's all I can say.

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,380
Any of you guys ever play Team Fort, too?

36
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:57,201
Anybody?

37
00:01:58,434 --> 00:01:58,875
Yeah.

38
00:02:00,436 --> 00:02:01,837
Yeah, I was the art director on that.

39
00:02:01,857 --> 00:02:05,541
Yeah, just a little game that didn't do much for the industry at all.

40
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:10,925
I didn't know it at the time.

41
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:11,706
My name is Greg Furch.

42
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:15,770
I was the art director on XCOM Enemy Unknown and XCOM 2.

43
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:20,074
Spent 22 years at Firaxis Games.

44
00:02:20,154 --> 00:02:21,235
I am newly independent.

45
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:23,136
At a unannounced...

46
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:29,039
studio with an unannounced title. So, yes.

47
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:31,160
Go ahead.

48
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,320
Go ahead, Claire.

49
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:39,243
My name's Claire Hummel. I've been a concept artist and art director in the industry for a little over ten years now.

50
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:46,185
My first job in the industry was technically at Neopets, where I worked as an artist for seven summers.

51
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:50,366
Uh, yeah.

52
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:55,367
Um, and, and since then I've worked at, uh, Microsoft games.

53
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:58,388
I worked on Bioshock Infinite, designed the Lutece twins.

54
00:02:58,788 --> 00:03:02,749
Um, I worked at HBO doing a Westworld VR project, and now I'm with the

55
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:05,049
Campo Santo team who is now at Valve.

56
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:06,630
So that's where I'm at.

57
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,410
Yeah.

58
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,790
Uh, so I'm Gavin Goulden.

59
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:16,389
Currently, the lead character artist at Insomniac Games, who has worked on Marvel's Spider-Man.

60
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:23,771
But 17 years ago, I started as, I would say, a determined failure.

61
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:29,253
Basically, I dropped out of school because I was sure that I knew more than the teacher.

62
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:30,634
I moved across the country.

63
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:31,874
I didn't know more than the teacher.

64
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:36,055
I applied to multiple jobs that got rejected multiple times.

65
00:03:36,355 --> 00:03:37,436
I eventually landed...

66
00:03:38,477 --> 00:03:40,338
a contract gig doing pixel art,

67
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,921
which maybe shows my age.

68
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:45,924
And from there that led to a studio job

69
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:47,345
working on mobile games at the time,

70
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:49,007
doing UI character designs

71
00:03:49,107 --> 00:03:51,589
and environment tiles and stuff like that.

72
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:54,552
And eventually worked my way up as a full-time character artist

73
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:55,793
in multiple studios later.

74
00:03:55,813 --> 00:03:57,374
Here I am.

75
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,782
I'm Wyeth Johnson.

76
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,362
I'm creeping up on my 20th year in the industry.

77
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:06,843
I've had any number of random art roles along the way,

78
00:04:06,903 --> 00:04:10,544
but predominantly technical art and effects related stuff.

79
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,904
So if you have questions or portfolios related to those,

80
00:04:12,984 --> 00:04:13,764
definitely come talk to me.

81
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:16,865
I've been an art lead and a technical art lead

82
00:04:16,885 --> 00:04:19,546
and an art director at Epic Games in one way or another

83
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:20,566
for the last 13 years.

84
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:24,286
Okay, give these guys a round of applause.

85
00:04:31,293 --> 00:04:34,016
So our room last year fit like five people.

86
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:36,438
So this is very exciting to see.

87
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,961
Yeah, we had a little room problem last year.

88
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:41,684
But obviously the room is twice the size, and that means

89
00:04:41,744 --> 00:04:43,246
twice the fun and amazing questions.

90
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:46,309
So I want to just talk to you guys about just some common

91
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:48,251
issues of things you're seeing in portfolios.

92
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:50,013
And I'd like to open up to the panel on that.

93
00:04:52,262 --> 00:04:52,542
Claire.

94
00:04:53,123 --> 00:04:53,403
Wow.

95
00:04:53,863 --> 00:04:54,543
Put on the spot.

96
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:58,885
I feel like we were talking about this a little yesterday,

97
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:01,027
but I feel like a thing I see, especially

98
00:05:01,207 --> 00:05:03,708
in game-centric portfolios, you see it

99
00:05:03,728 --> 00:05:05,209
on the front page of ArtStation a lot,

100
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:09,231
is this focus on improving your technical skills

101
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,972
without really improving the intent and message

102
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:13,413
and thought behind it.

103
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,235
And you will see so many amazing artists there.

104
00:05:16,255 --> 00:05:18,098
There are always going to be artists out there who are

105
00:05:18,138 --> 00:05:19,559
technically better than all of us.

106
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,302
But if you have a portfolio that proves that you have a

107
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:25,205
unique voice, that it proves that you have taste as a thing

108
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:27,708
that we really brought up, that you're consuming things outside

109
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:30,111
of the industry, you're learning how to interpret it in

110
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,092
your own unique way.

111
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:34,474
that content is just as important, if not more important,

112
00:05:34,574 --> 00:05:36,135
than the technical skills themselves.

113
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:39,077
Because if I hire someone, I can teach them

114
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:40,838
how to use Photoshop better.

115
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:43,060
But it's a lot harder to teach someone

116
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,902
just the process of learning what your passions are

117
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:49,243
and what you uniquely bring to a project.

118
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:53,506
I feel, Wyeth, you were also really passionate about this,

119
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:54,647
especially when we were at lunch.

120
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:58,429
Well, I just feel like there's so much focus on,

121
00:05:58,489 --> 00:06:00,050
man, I really know ZBrush.

122
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:05,420
I know it so much and you're like, okay, great. I mean, that's good. That's useful. You need those skills

123
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,421
but like if you have good taste and

124
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:12,522
You have an eye and you've developed that and you start to have a little bit of a point of view and you have something

125
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:17,684
To say I'll teach you any tool in three months. Like if you're talented you can learn the tool

126
00:06:18,584 --> 00:06:21,765
so I think this very forward focus on the

127
00:06:22,825 --> 00:06:26,666
The technical side of it like yeah, I'm getting really good at Maya. It's like I don't really care

128
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:30,972
I want you to just show me that you know how to make art, basically.

129
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:34,137
I think that goes back to the common thing that we usually talk about,

130
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:36,521
is like, you know, too much stuff.

131
00:06:36,742 --> 00:06:39,446
Like the taste part of it is like editing, right?

132
00:06:39,526 --> 00:06:42,110
How much is in your portfolio as well.

133
00:06:42,712 --> 00:06:46,016
Yeah, I would say there's also like a lack of execution too.

134
00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:48,758
So again, like focusing on the tools,

135
00:06:48,798 --> 00:06:52,202
you'll end up having a portfolio full of like ZBrush models

136
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:56,185
or you'll have an illustration but not a concept

137
00:06:56,406 --> 00:07:00,370
or you'll have a sphere with a great substance on it,

138
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,991
but it's not in a level,

139
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:03,953
it's not actually being used in any context.

140
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:06,314
and what you need to see and how you'll improve

141
00:07:06,755 --> 00:07:08,735
is finishing something, and if it sucks,

142
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:11,076
burn it to the ground, build back up,

143
00:07:11,136 --> 00:07:12,857
and just keep doing it until you're good.

144
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:18,120
What's the importance of presentation?

145
00:07:21,238 --> 00:07:24,179
I think that kind of goes back to what Gavin was just saying.

146
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:26,199
You want to make sure that you're

147
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,120
presenting things in context, like a sphere with a material.

148
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,121
Great.

149
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:33,621
Where does it live?

150
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,882
Show me how it exists with four more materials in harmony

151
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:37,602
in a shot.

152
00:07:38,882 --> 00:07:41,043
Same thing with your models, your concepts.

153
00:07:42,523 --> 00:07:45,264
Do you do a demo reel for a character?

154
00:07:48,505 --> 00:07:51,345
Probably not unless it's moving like the general rule of thumb

155
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:56,166
My opinion is that if it's if it's not moving it doesn't really get a demo reel

156
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:59,027
Like I want to see if I'm looking at environment artists. I want to see

157
00:08:00,187 --> 00:08:07,248
Breakdown of their assets. I want to be actually digested. I don't want compression to ruin what's happening streaming across the internet

158
00:08:07,948 --> 00:08:10,669
If you want to fly through demo reel to add

159
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:15,750
Great, but like I'd rather see things where I can evaluate the work animation

160
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,010
You have to see it move effects. You have to see it move

161
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:21,171
But rule of thumb, that's generally.

162
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:24,272
I mean, you only get one first impression, right?

163
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:26,353
So when you're showing your portfolio,

164
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,793
you want to make sure that the message is,

165
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:32,895
I want to be hired by you, and I'm doing this skill.

166
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:36,076
So anything that you do that gets in the way of me hiring you

167
00:08:36,536 --> 00:08:37,276
is a bad choice.

168
00:08:37,656 --> 00:08:39,737
So too many clicks on a website,

169
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:42,257
demo realism shouldn't be video formats,

170
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:44,738
like weird design choices like that.

171
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:47,739
Anything that complicates you getting a job is a bad choice.

172
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:49,200
something you shouldn't do.

173
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,962
Over time I've realized one of the important things about a good portfolio is that it reduces friction.

174
00:08:54,943 --> 00:09:02,266
It just reduces the friction between the person reviewing it and the quality of the content getting to their eyeballs, basically.

175
00:09:02,527 --> 00:09:11,151
So any kind of choice that you are making which adds complexity or adds clicks or obfuscates some of the decisions you're making behind pages or video downloads and all these other things,

176
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:16,154
that's all increasing the friction between your art and the people that are reviewing it.

177
00:09:18,486 --> 00:09:22,098
Why, just to elaborate on that, would you say the work should speak for yourself?

178
00:09:22,138 --> 00:09:23,383
You shouldn't have to explain it.

179
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:28,267
Yeah, it's interesting, particularly with a first impression.

180
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:31,048
So it's always like you want to start with your strongest thing.

181
00:09:31,268 --> 00:09:33,449
And that's a very common thing that you're going to hear over and over the

182
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,930
portfolios. What is the absolute strongest thing you have, which by the way,

183
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:40,511
you are probably not capable of judging. Yes. Like it just,

184
00:09:40,531 --> 00:09:43,052
and that's just an honest fact is like, you're going to want people,

185
00:09:43,252 --> 00:09:44,092
other external people,

186
00:09:44,152 --> 00:09:48,813
professors and peers and experts in the field to be able to help you guide what

187
00:09:48,853 --> 00:09:50,014
you think your best thing is.

188
00:09:50,054 --> 00:09:52,835
Cause oftentimes it's just the thing that you're closest to,

189
00:09:52,855 --> 00:09:54,295
but not necessarily the strongest.

190
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:55,596
That's a tangent.

191
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:57,377
But just kind of this...

192
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,881
When you're making that very, very first impression,

193
00:10:04,842 --> 00:10:06,163
you don't wanna have to explain yourself.

194
00:10:06,623 --> 00:10:10,165
You want it to be very self-evident in that first work,

195
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:12,427
why you exist as an artist,

196
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:14,448
so that people are like, oh yeah, this is person,

197
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,149
you know, character guy, got it.

198
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,130
Really into sci-fi, cool, whatever.

199
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:19,731
Let that say something.

200
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:21,713
As you get further in, yeah.

201
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:22,933
I feel personally attacked.

202
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:25,276
Insane character maniac.

203
00:10:26,037 --> 00:10:27,438
Yeah.

204
00:10:27,598 --> 00:10:29,700
But then as you get further in, there oftentimes

205
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,762
is a little bit of reason for explanation

206
00:10:31,843 --> 00:10:33,484
because we want to know a little bit of the why

207
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:34,966
behind some of the decisions you've made.

208
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:36,728
You just have to keep that stuff light.

209
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:38,409
And if you've collaborated with people,

210
00:10:38,469 --> 00:10:39,991
you need to make sure you call that out too

211
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:41,292
so that we know what you did.

212
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:43,555
Because that can be a big problem as well.

213
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:45,280
That is a huge thing, I feel like.

214
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,840
If you are a character concept artist

215
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,901
and your work has been taken to a final model,

216
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:53,342
I think it's very important to show that process

217
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,283
because it shows that your work can be

218
00:10:55,683 --> 00:10:57,344
successfully translated into 3D,

219
00:10:57,644 --> 00:10:59,604
but crediting those artists that you work with

220
00:10:59,704 --> 00:11:02,325
because everything we do is part of this huge pipeline

221
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:05,046
and everything you're doing is about enabling

222
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:06,727
the next person in that pipeline.

223
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:09,347
So if you forget it, I think people notice.

224
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:11,568
Well, just one more comment.

225
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,108
Like Greg, one of the things you always say

226
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,989
is you look at the portfolio first and then the resume.

227
00:11:16,749 --> 00:11:18,410
Actually, I look at the portfolio,

228
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,690
and then the second thing I look at is the portfolio.

229
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:27,211
And then I may look at your name if I go to email you.

230
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:29,652
So good art is good art.

231
00:11:30,532 --> 00:11:33,813
That's kind of the work is all that I care about.

232
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:36,113
And I think we've all been talking about this for years.

233
00:11:36,813 --> 00:11:39,934
And I think the whole group probably feels that way.

234
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:41,403
Okay.

235
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:46,409
So when we all got together at lunch to have a discussion,

236
00:11:46,469 --> 00:11:49,473
these guys could not stop talking about or about the

237
00:11:49,513 --> 00:11:53,579
tutorials. So I know Gavin, you should have some really good

238
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,682
insights and also Moby.

239
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:59,246
Yeah. Uh, well, I think it started by

240
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,021
how a lot of portfolios will end up having classwork

241
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:05,422
or something from Gumroad that you'll do.

242
00:12:05,922 --> 00:12:08,623
And while that serves a purpose in learning the tools,

243
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:13,605
again, going back to that, lacking a soul, I suppose,

244
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:17,547
that's sort of where your portfolio needs to be.

245
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,668
So even though the class assignments,

246
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,789
the technical stuff is really important,

247
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:23,310
you need to put your own spin on it.

248
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,151
I'm looking at Moby because

249
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,792
you know, even though Greg explained it, he's a god tier designer.

250
00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:36,135
So somebody like me has like drooled over Team Fortress stuff.

251
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:41,457
And really, like he has set the bar for people like you in the audience

252
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:45,419
to have a job doing really pulling back to illustration

253
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,241
and like classic like, you know, rules for design.

254
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:49,901
I kind of wanted to ask you like.

255
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:54,893
How do you do it? How do you be how do you be a moment?

256
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:56,935
I

257
00:12:56,975 --> 00:12:57,896
mean really like

258
00:12:59,037 --> 00:13:03,722
You know in art school. I was very very lucky because I was setting out to become a non-digital artist

259
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:06,905
I mean, so I was learning oil painting gouache painting

260
00:13:07,826 --> 00:13:13,451
Pastel you know run the gamut of everything so for five years. That's what I really you know. That's what I was really into

261
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:19,444
Once I saw what they were working on at Valve, that's really, it was Half-Life 2.

262
00:13:19,704 --> 00:13:21,889
And I saw that they could actually create this world.

263
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:24,434
I mean, that's what, 15 years ago or so.

264
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:29,384
but it was something that, it just blew my mind.

265
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:30,586
I saw that you could actually,

266
00:13:30,626 --> 00:13:32,307
instead of like a Pixar movie where it's only,

267
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:33,669
I know I'm going down a tangent here,

268
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,811
but you know, it takes years to produce something

269
00:13:35,831 --> 00:13:37,473
that you're gonna consume for about, you know,

270
00:13:37,673 --> 00:13:39,335
an hour and a half or so, or two hours.

271
00:13:40,216 --> 00:13:43,699
This you're gonna be playing and enjoying for, you know,

272
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,561
60 hours, something like that.

273
00:13:45,602 --> 00:13:46,082
But anyways.

274
00:13:48,214 --> 00:13:53,563
I personally still love doing a lot of traditional work, doing drawings.

275
00:13:53,843 --> 00:13:58,591
I still do gouache paintings for my character concepts as well, and I'll also do digital

276
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:00,314
as well, but it's good to have a variety.

277
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:09,407
Do you have any tips or tricks for how would somebody take a classical training like that?

278
00:14:09,487 --> 00:14:13,348
Or how would somebody take something that's very standardized?

279
00:14:13,428 --> 00:14:18,490
Everybody can download this Sci-Fi corridor hallway tutorial from Gumroad, right?

280
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,590
How would you advise somebody to take that and make it their own?

281
00:14:22,011 --> 00:14:23,071
Wow, that's a good question.

282
00:14:26,652 --> 00:14:34,180
The tutorials that I've seen, I mean, they're very, very good, but at the same time, we just have to be, you know, careful because so many...

283
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:40,707
It's a very incestuous, you know, institution, gaming, entertainment in general, right?

284
00:14:41,307 --> 00:14:44,530
A lot of people that I know, or even portfolios that I see,

285
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,371
everybody's looking at ArtStation.

286
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:49,354
And I love ArtStation as it showcases talent,

287
00:14:49,434 --> 00:14:50,675
but at the same time, a lot of people

288
00:14:50,775 --> 00:14:52,236
use that as reference gathering.

289
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:56,039
And I would really love to have a tutorial where

290
00:14:56,099 --> 00:14:58,981
people are kind of taught to think outside of the box.

291
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:04,065
So instead of, I mean, we're all fans of sci-fi or fantasy,

292
00:15:04,165 --> 00:15:04,826
whatever the case.

293
00:15:04,886 --> 00:15:08,909
But imagine coming up with your own way of sourcing.

294
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,190
You know.

295
00:15:11,015 --> 00:15:15,678
gathering information, gleaning, and being able to tinker with that and bring it forward.

296
00:15:16,438 --> 00:15:22,522
I'd love to speak to that, that in terms of people digesting art from ArtStation, kind

297
00:15:22,562 --> 00:15:27,345
of spitting it out, there you will see so many portfolios that look like knock-off Simon

298
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:32,469
Stollenhag portfolios, and it's so abundantly clear that it's not his because his is coming

299
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:34,150
from this lived experience.

300
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:39,433
It's referencing his own life, his own childhood, and there's kind of a truth there.

301
00:15:39,893 --> 00:15:44,475
And if you're just sort of one step removed from that, it's like taking a JPEG and saving

302
00:15:44,535 --> 00:15:45,516
it over and over again.

303
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:49,538
It just turns into this jumbled, hideous Pikachu that you can't recognize anymore.

304
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:54,141
And so I feel like finding, reaching outside of games,

305
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:57,163
looking at traditional illustration and painting,

306
00:15:57,203 --> 00:16:00,225
looking at film, just getting out of your house,

307
00:16:00,305 --> 00:16:01,726
reading literature, anything you can do

308
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:04,287
to bring that influence back into your work

309
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:07,069
is so refreshing because my god,

310
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:09,450
you see so many environments that are beautifully painted,

311
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,832
but it's the same vignetted, spiky mountains

312
00:16:12,912 --> 00:16:15,014
with a tiny person, they have a staff,

313
00:16:15,134 --> 00:16:16,695
and there's a city in the distance.

314
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:20,978
You very rarely see that in the real world.

315
00:16:21,058 --> 00:16:24,080
Like the fact that nature is crazier than most concept art is,

316
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,663
like it's worth looking at those references outside your industry.

317
00:16:27,883 --> 00:16:30,165
And originality isn't too far away.

318
00:16:30,185 --> 00:16:33,407
I think that's one thing that people get really stuck on is like,

319
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:35,468
I have to have this insane idea,

320
00:16:35,489 --> 00:16:38,130
and I have to do this ridiculous world building,

321
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:38,911
and I have to invent,

322
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,394
and like the reality is, is just make a little choice.

323
00:16:43,094 --> 00:16:44,956
All you have to do is just choose something.

324
00:16:45,156 --> 00:16:47,738
And it doesn't have to be really far from where you are,

325
00:16:47,858 --> 00:16:49,620
or even far from real-world reference.

326
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,041
Just make a little choice,

327
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:54,364
and then that choice will steer you in a new place.

328
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:57,107
Just change the surface or a material type on something

329
00:16:57,167 --> 00:16:58,168
into something unexpected.

330
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:00,650
Or make something translucent that's not supposed to be.

331
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,611
Or just, I mean, I'm just throwing stuff out here,

332
00:17:02,632 --> 00:17:04,173
but just make a little choice,

333
00:17:04,693 --> 00:17:06,195
and then within making that little choice,

334
00:17:06,235 --> 00:17:08,277
you realize you're injecting a little bit of originality

335
00:17:08,337 --> 00:17:09,478
because you don't have the thing.

336
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:11,999
the photograph to compare it to or whatever.

337
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,461
And you might start to find your voice a little bit that way,

338
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:16,102
where you start making these little choices,

339
00:17:16,462 --> 00:17:19,744
and then you realize, oh, I kind of like this, I dig this, this is my jam.

340
00:17:20,645 --> 00:17:22,966
So it's just not super far away.

341
00:17:22,986 --> 00:17:25,468
You don't have to go way down the rabbit hole to find originality.

342
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:27,109
just steer it a little bit.

343
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,512
I would say too, a lot of it is just telling the story.

344
00:17:31,072 --> 00:17:33,974
What story is the piece telling?

345
00:17:33,994 --> 00:17:36,956
If you did download this tutorial and you're working from that,

346
00:17:37,377 --> 00:17:38,478
what story do you want to tell?

347
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:43,741
With Claire, I've worked from Claire's designs before on Bioshock,

348
00:17:44,042 --> 00:17:46,804
and the best part of your designs...

349
00:17:47,989 --> 00:17:49,129
suck up to you or anything like that.

350
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,090
But is that like the thought and the research

351
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,771
that goes into it and it's like clearly coming

352
00:17:53,811 --> 00:17:55,932
from a place of inspiration versus just like

353
00:17:56,452 --> 00:17:59,213
it's a copy paste photo bashed outfit,

354
00:17:59,293 --> 00:17:59,773
you know what I mean?

355
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:04,034
And like something like that really speaks to your taste,

356
00:18:04,194 --> 00:18:07,015
your style and what sets you above like other people.

357
00:18:07,155 --> 00:18:08,235
So be like Claire.

358
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,201
Claire raised a good, sorry, I just want to say yeah,

359
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:13,262
beautiful point looking outside the industry.

360
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:14,142
It's super important.

361
00:18:14,702 --> 00:18:18,744
I go to a lot of these conferences in Europe, for example,

362
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,725
do a lot of portfolio reviews and I'm just shocked,

363
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:24,906
just shocked at how many times it's the same portfolio.

364
00:18:24,966 --> 00:18:26,847
It's just the same portfolios over and over again,

365
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:29,508
so you just gotta really be cognizant.

366
00:18:29,528 --> 00:18:33,129
It's only like maybe one or 0.01% of people

367
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:38,411
that actually stand out over that entire portfolio review.

368
00:18:38,766 --> 00:18:41,588
I think the one thing too that comes down with this too with the portfolio is not to

369
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:46,993
labor on these, but if you take a tutorial and you do it, great.

370
00:18:47,073 --> 00:18:48,835
That doesn't mean you post that in your portfolio.

371
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:55,901
Go do it again, and when you do it again, start looking for ways to make it yours.

372
00:18:57,022 --> 00:19:03,207
It also shows that you understand the concept and not what button to click, right?

373
00:19:03,787 --> 00:19:06,450
And the tech's going to change.

374
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:10,051
yearly, maybe more.

375
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:15,195
But when you understand what the higher level concept was to the button click,

376
00:19:16,316 --> 00:19:18,858
it's a much deeper

377
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,280
advantage for you as an artist.

378
00:19:25,955 --> 00:19:34,023
So one of the things that Greg and I actually you and I talk about a lot is the sorry comparing

379
00:19:34,063 --> 00:19:38,948
your work to other people and to setting the bar that's what's expected in the industry

380
00:19:38,988 --> 00:19:39,248
today.

381
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,803
Yeah, I mean, it's like when I started, you know, they had rocks and sticks to draw with.

382
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:50,687
But there wasn't a way to compare your work, right?

383
00:19:50,747 --> 00:19:54,670
Like there was an art station, there wasn't Polycount, there wasn't a community.

384
00:19:55,971 --> 00:19:56,531
I'm like Moby.

385
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,092
I started as a traditional artist.

386
00:19:59,473 --> 00:20:01,175
So anyway.

387
00:20:04,217 --> 00:20:07,422
you know, now you've got all these reference points to compare against,

388
00:20:07,742 --> 00:20:11,608
and you're not comparing against the kid in school sitting next to you,

389
00:20:11,648 --> 00:20:14,191
you're comparing against the people that are pros.

390
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:18,369
you may not be able to beat Gavin's characters,

391
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:20,470
but Gavin's the guy you're chasing.

392
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,570
He's your competition.

393
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:25,451
He's the guy you should be looking to kind of catch.

394
00:20:27,652 --> 00:20:29,473
And so, again, it's not just like

395
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:31,434
biggest fish in the smallest pond.

396
00:20:32,034 --> 00:20:35,055
When you enter the market,

397
00:20:35,115 --> 00:20:37,916
you're actually competing against seasoned pros.

398
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:41,478
So, like, making sure that you're looking at the right bar.

399
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:47,221
And again, with ArtStation, you know, PolyCon, all the communities you have now, it's so

400
00:20:47,241 --> 00:20:47,942
much easier to find it.

401
00:20:49,243 --> 00:20:53,425
One thing I like is if people have some questions, I'd like you to line up at both sections of

402
00:20:53,705 --> 00:20:54,746
the stage with the microphone.

403
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:56,447
Now.

404
00:20:57,027 --> 00:20:58,148
Anyone else have a comment?

405
00:21:01,323 --> 00:21:06,487
Other than just agreeing, but I mean, I think a like the common misconception when you're in school

406
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:08,669
is that if you're the top of your class that you're the

407
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:14,213
you're hirable and really that's not true because you have to like broaden your horizons and

408
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:18,297
Seek feedback from people that aren't your friends or your immediate peers, right?

409
00:21:18,317 --> 00:21:22,000
And like that's how you'll that's how you'll be challenged to become better and that's how you'll get a better

410
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,642
Understanding of who you're up against, you know

411
00:21:25,562 --> 00:21:31,663
When I first got to Valve, for example, they called me Slobey because I was really slow.

412
00:21:33,483 --> 00:21:33,984
It was bad.

413
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:39,025
And I remember I was sharing an office with this concept artist and I actually didn't

414
00:21:39,045 --> 00:21:40,145
know Photoshop at all.

415
00:21:40,385 --> 00:21:44,466
I mean, I didn't know how to use the layers, the Wacom tablet, nothing.

416
00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:46,047
And I was struggling.

417
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:49,827
And you know, I was on edge because I was at Valve and that's kind of scary.

418
00:21:49,847 --> 00:21:50,588
So I...

419
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:55,188
I went home that night and I got my sketchbook,

420
00:21:55,488 --> 00:21:57,550
which was gray, like a nice gray tone paper,

421
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,432
and I started just drawing my concepts there

422
00:21:59,472 --> 00:22:01,153
and doing my gouache approach.

423
00:22:01,694 --> 00:22:03,135
And I came the next day with this nice,

424
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:04,776
you know, four or five concepts,

425
00:22:04,836 --> 00:22:06,057
and I showed it to my friend

426
00:22:06,077 --> 00:22:07,258
that I was sharing the office with.

427
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:09,620
And he's like, how the hell did you do that?

428
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,463
I was like, he didn't know what it was, right?

429
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:14,164
He didn't know what type of material it was.

430
00:22:14,344 --> 00:22:14,845
And I was like, no.

431
00:22:15,846 --> 00:22:18,087
So we kind of traded, so he kind of taught me things

432
00:22:18,147 --> 00:22:20,128
and I taught him, but it was nice to come in

433
00:22:20,148 --> 00:22:21,269
with a completely different approach.

434
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:22,350
You didn't need the tools.

435
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,892
And yeah, in like a month I knew how to use basic Photoshop.

436
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:31,075
I see there's quite lines already,

437
00:22:31,135 --> 00:22:32,857
so we're gonna dive into some of the questions,

438
00:22:33,037 --> 00:22:33,677
if that's okay.

439
00:22:34,137 --> 00:22:34,317
Sure.

440
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:40,327
So quick question about environmental pieces.

441
00:22:40,847 --> 00:22:44,308
When you see a scene, do you also,

442
00:22:44,808 --> 00:22:47,569
like I know ArtStation lets you show multiple pictures

443
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:48,889
of like all the assets and what,

444
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:51,390
do you like seeing a couple shots of the scene

445
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:55,031
and then the assets and maybe a sketchy concept

446
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:55,832
if there's one?

447
00:22:55,992 --> 00:23:02,058
Yeah, like I would go like a that your beauty piece should be the piece that gets my attention because I don't have, you know, forever.

448
00:23:02,138 --> 00:23:06,703
Right. So like the, the harmony, the, like, this is the environment, the scene, everything working together.

449
00:23:07,244 --> 00:23:09,666
And then from there work macro to micro.

450
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:16,174
So like, you know, beauty shot, you know, isolate assets, possibly show concepts if you want.

451
00:23:16,734 --> 00:23:21,820
but kind of like kind of breaking it down so that as you get my interest with the pretty

452
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,024
shot and then I'll start looking deeper and deeper and deeper.

453
00:23:26,165 --> 00:23:29,969
But if you start the other way, it gets a little, yeah, no one wants to see the crappy

454
00:23:29,989 --> 00:23:30,690
little sketch.

455
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,372
You know, show me, show me the awesome.

456
00:23:32,813 --> 00:23:35,476
And then once I got the awesome, like then I'll look for more.

457
00:23:35,496 --> 00:23:36,256
Um, yeah.

458
00:23:38,055 --> 00:23:44,376
And it really does stand out if you also show, you know, elevations or smaller breakdowns

459
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:44,976
of the space.

460
00:23:45,036 --> 00:23:49,517
Or if you're showing this larger space and then you start to show smaller angles if you

461
00:23:49,537 --> 00:23:52,238
were actually exploring it, or the path through a space.

462
00:23:52,258 --> 00:23:56,198
I think it's really important to show it's, you can draw a beautiful environment but then

463
00:23:56,238 --> 00:24:00,179
actually showing how the player is going to experience it or how someone is going to make

464
00:24:00,259 --> 00:24:00,319
it.

465
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:03,260
Anything you can do on that front is very gratifying to see.

466
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,681
It actually, it also adds some body to your portfolio too.

467
00:24:05,701 --> 00:24:08,183
It gives a little like, it's not just one image,

468
00:24:08,223 --> 00:24:09,304
you start to get a little more,

469
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:10,965
and it's still substance, right?

470
00:24:13,127 --> 00:24:16,249
So like, you get more images out of one image,

471
00:24:16,469 --> 00:24:18,251
and so it gives a little more depth.

472
00:24:18,931 --> 00:24:19,752
So it's good to do.

473
00:24:20,372 --> 00:24:22,894
And I'm guessing it just shows like how the,

474
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,935
basically how it ends,

475
00:24:24,975 --> 00:24:27,197
and then you see the backwards process

476
00:24:27,477 --> 00:24:28,698
all the way to how it began.

477
00:24:30,144 --> 00:24:36,792
Absolutely, I mean it's almost like looking at an architect's interpretation of a house,

478
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:37,373
right?

479
00:24:37,493 --> 00:24:40,557
You're not just going to build the house from that image.

480
00:24:40,577 --> 00:24:43,581
You've got to go in and show the blueprints and all that stuff, right?

481
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:45,573
All right, thank you very much.

482
00:24:45,593 --> 00:24:47,314
Sure.

483
00:24:47,494 --> 00:24:49,876
You guys talked a lot about making sure

484
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:53,538
that your portfolio stands out from other people's things

485
00:24:53,578 --> 00:24:56,581
that have been regurgitated onto ArtStation time after time.

486
00:24:57,261 --> 00:24:59,542
But do you have any advice for making sure

487
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:03,185
that something is to your personal taste and style

488
00:25:03,305 --> 00:25:05,887
and is unique, but still looks like something

489
00:25:05,967 --> 00:25:09,509
that to an art manager and director

490
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,211
still makes it clear that you're capable of working

491
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:17,497
space marine game that they're hiring for.

492
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:21,903
Do you want to, I mean it depends on if you even want to do, you know, space marines, right?

493
00:25:21,943 --> 00:25:25,928
Like if, you know, do you want to work at 343? I mean I

494
00:25:25,968 --> 00:25:30,053
probably wouldn't be a good fit there because I have a different taste. I admire

495
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:38,715
what they do. But I gear up my portfolio for specific companies or the games in general.

496
00:25:38,935 --> 00:25:43,898
I don't want to work on a game that I don't, you know, if it's in a genre that I don't

497
00:25:43,938 --> 00:25:45,819
like I'm not even going to do it either.

498
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:53,761
I think it's, yeah, one, make sure you're applying places that you want to work or that

499
00:25:53,781 --> 00:25:57,686
you can find a hook in that work that still makes it interesting to you.

500
00:25:58,187 --> 00:26:02,352
So if you can, I mean, there's so many boring space Marines out there, but say you do a

501
00:26:02,412 --> 00:26:05,035
take on space Marines, that's referencing like 60s, NASA.

502
00:26:06,797 --> 00:26:10,941
technology or that's using animal imagery and patterning or historical

503
00:26:10,981 --> 00:26:14,444
fashion and tailoring. There are ways that you can bring interesting shape

504
00:26:14,484 --> 00:26:18,627
language and details to something that's otherwise kind of boring. When I

505
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:21,830
interviewed at Microsoft, I just straight, they're like, what properties wouldn't

506
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:25,734
you want to work on? I was like, oh, Halo. It's so dumb. It's for boys.

507
00:26:26,414 --> 00:26:32,218
And I just, I was such a little firebrand and it was kind of irresponsible of me to

508
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:37,301
not just say like, oh, I don't think I'd be interested in Halo, but I bet I could find

509
00:26:37,341 --> 00:26:41,823
a way to bring my expertise and my personal voice to this.

510
00:26:41,863 --> 00:26:42,344
You should hire me.

511
00:26:42,364 --> 00:26:42,464
Yeah.

512
00:26:42,484 --> 00:26:42,564
Yeah.

513
00:26:42,604 --> 00:26:42,704
Yeah.

514
00:26:42,724 --> 00:26:42,804
Yeah.

515
00:26:42,824 --> 00:26:42,904
Yeah.

516
00:26:42,924 --> 00:26:43,024
Yeah.

517
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:43,124
Yeah.

518
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:43,404
Yeah.

519
00:26:43,424 --> 00:26:43,925
Yeah.

520
00:26:43,945 --> 00:26:44,025
Yeah.

521
00:26:44,045 --> 00:26:44,125
Yeah.

522
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:44,225
Yeah.

523
00:26:45,365 --> 00:26:46,026
Yeah.

524
00:26:47,158 --> 00:26:51,539
Hi, so I'm from Academy of Art and I'm working on my portfolio this semester.

525
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:57,000
So my question would be, is there any advice for level designers to showcase their works

526
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,061
in portfolio, like what people are looking for from level designers' portfolio?

527
00:27:02,582 --> 00:27:03,002
Go ahead.

528
00:27:03,042 --> 00:27:03,762
No, go ahead.

529
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,082
For level design?

530
00:27:05,662 --> 00:27:06,423
Yeah.

531
00:27:07,463 --> 00:27:09,123
I mean, it's really like how you're going to interpret.

532
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:14,645
So do you work with a collaboration of artists for environment design?

533
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:14,765
Yeah.

534
00:27:15,505 --> 00:27:20,029
so that they can help build up the level for you

535
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:22,991
and help supply assets and whatnot.

536
00:27:24,192 --> 00:27:27,515
The way that we work, or I've worked in the past

537
00:27:27,535 --> 00:27:31,158
with level design, there's kind of like an in-between.

538
00:27:31,198 --> 00:27:33,640
There's an environment crew that helps

539
00:27:35,742 --> 00:27:40,907
port over the representation.

540
00:27:41,931 --> 00:27:48,425
right, of, you know, tangible assets, right, over the abstract of game, of the gameplay

541
00:27:48,865 --> 00:27:49,186
space.

542
00:27:50,028 --> 00:27:51,451
So, that's a good question.

543
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:55,151
Yeah, it depends if you're world building or level designing.

544
00:27:55,351 --> 00:27:58,973
Like world building is, you know, like you're laying out.

545
00:28:00,855 --> 00:28:03,436
You know, probably involve a little bit of lighting and stuff.

546
00:28:03,737 --> 00:28:08,380
Level design, I think it's good to maybe have like a little bit

547
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,982
of a playable, so I can move around the space.

548
00:28:11,642 --> 00:28:12,603
So again, that would be a presentation.

549
00:28:12,623 --> 00:28:15,445
I think it's a little different, but it's catered

550
00:28:15,505 --> 00:28:17,186
to the thing you're trying to make.

551
00:28:17,206 --> 00:28:19,968
Thank you.

552
00:28:21,707 --> 00:28:22,207
Hi, everyone.

553
00:28:22,247 --> 00:28:23,007
Thanks for the talk.

554
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:27,229
So I'm currently working at an animation studio that

555
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:30,650
is predominantly working on a Disney series.

556
00:28:31,951 --> 00:28:36,152
And I would like to shift into realistic-looking environment

557
00:28:36,232 --> 00:28:36,673
art for AAA.

558
00:28:37,853 --> 00:28:42,476
And I'm trying to figure out how to kind of shift my portfolio from being this very stylized

559
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:48,901
kind of looking thing to more environmental art without completely disregarding my experience

560
00:28:48,921 --> 00:28:52,463
with pipeline and working with others and that kind of thing.

561
00:28:52,703 --> 00:28:53,804
Do you have any tips on that?

562
00:28:55,665 --> 00:29:01,889
Those transitions are hard because oftentimes they do have to feel a little bit like an afterthought in the portfolio.

563
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,811
Otherwise, the message is going to feel very awkward and mixed.

564
00:29:05,672 --> 00:29:11,015
And we're, you know, we're going to be reviewing it and we're kind of go like, what, what is this?

565
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:16,519
You know, it would be the kind of broad scale question you start to ask yourself of like, what does this person really want to do?

566
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:23,344
The reality is you're going to have to basically set all that stuff aside and work as if none of it exists.

567
00:29:24,404 --> 00:29:33,368
And then really, really drive home the quality of a high-end, realistically rendered, if that's your thing now,

568
00:29:33,508 --> 00:29:38,370
portfolio for environments that includes that squint test overall feeling being right,

569
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,111
and the lighting being right, and the tonal range being right, and then the...

570
00:29:41,632 --> 00:29:45,673
If you're going for realism, then the albedo and the textures have to be right and everything.

571
00:29:46,054 --> 00:29:50,015
So you have to nail all that stuff and assume that your other experience doesn't exist.

572
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:55,498
And then once you have that stuff and it's there for you, you start to work some of your other

573
00:29:55,538 --> 00:30:00,940
experiences back into your portfolio strategically or even just in your resume as a compliment to

574
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,840
the portfolio to say, hey,

575
00:30:02,461 --> 00:30:03,301
there is more to me.

576
00:30:03,321 --> 00:30:06,563
I have more to offer, but this thing,

577
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:08,024
this is the thing I care about,

578
00:30:08,044 --> 00:30:09,425
and this is what you should be judging me on.

579
00:30:09,705 --> 00:30:11,486
And then oftentimes we might get into a situation

580
00:30:11,526 --> 00:30:14,568
where you're being compared to somebody who's roughly equal,

581
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:15,849
and then you might win,

582
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:18,030
because you have this little extra touch.

583
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,451
You have this pipeline experience.

584
00:30:19,571 --> 00:30:21,753
You can script in Python, you know, Mel,

585
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,013
I don't know what it is you know,

586
00:30:23,074 --> 00:30:26,195
but like there's some another little, you know, little.

587
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:30,126
cherry on top of the sundae and that can help push you over the edge.

588
00:30:30,427 --> 00:30:34,430
But I don't think you should really assume that any of that exists while you're

589
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:37,593
trying to put together a portfolio for a different kind of path.

590
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:43,018
Just to add to that, like usually when we're, uh, because we're in Los Angeles,

591
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:45,921
so there's plenty of film people around us. Uh,

592
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:48,323
so usually a turnoff of.

593
00:30:49,373 --> 00:30:55,837
hiring a applicant that's from film onto games is that there's usually like a

594
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:59,260
knowledge gap that you know I think you're trying to fill by like doing

595
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:03,883
these new pieces for games right so beyond the like technical understanding

596
00:31:03,923 --> 00:31:07,345
of like what's a PBR material like real-time rendering and you know

597
00:31:07,425 --> 00:31:10,107
building an efficient space and stuff like that it's more the

598
00:31:11,508 --> 00:31:14,571
purpose of it is a bit different because rather than just just telling the story

599
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:18,575
it's like an interactive space it's playable like does it like flow well and

600
00:31:18,735 --> 00:31:23,059
things like that so you got to kind of change your your mindset a little bit

601
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:30,306
and show that through the portfolio okay thank you hello I was wondering what was

602
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:35,210
the best way to represent a full game project in your resume and portfolio

603
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,923
So kind of like an IP, right, development.

604
00:31:39,423 --> 00:31:39,804
Yeah.

605
00:31:39,944 --> 00:31:43,087
Whether it's made independently or with a small team.

606
00:31:44,448 --> 00:31:45,248
That's a good question.

607
00:31:45,268 --> 00:31:47,751
I mean, if you've got a whole game that's done,

608
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:49,913
OK, so

609
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,415
if it's if there's a way to make.

610
00:31:55,142 --> 00:31:59,967
I'd treat it just like we do when we make a game, like record B-roll, splice it together,

611
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:04,711
cut out the boring stuff, like not having the mouse slide around, but like, yeah, like,

612
00:32:04,731 --> 00:32:05,292
you know, like treat it.

613
00:32:05,312 --> 00:32:05,392
Yeah.

614
00:32:05,412 --> 00:32:05,492
Yeah.

615
00:32:05,512 --> 00:32:05,592
Yeah.

616
00:32:05,612 --> 00:32:05,692
Yeah.

617
00:32:05,712 --> 00:32:05,792
Yeah.

618
00:32:05,812 --> 00:32:05,892
Yeah.

619
00:32:05,912 --> 00:32:06,012
Yeah.

620
00:32:06,032 --> 00:32:06,112
Yeah.

621
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:06,213
Yeah.

622
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:06,313
Yeah.

623
00:32:06,333 --> 00:32:06,413
Yeah.

624
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:06,513
Yeah.

625
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:06,633
Yeah.

626
00:32:06,653 --> 00:32:06,753
Yeah.

627
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:06,913
Yeah.

628
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:07,013
Yeah.

629
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:07,133
Yeah.

630
00:32:07,655 --> 00:32:10,718
But clip it together like B-roll, like a trailer.

631
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,462
Same way I go about selling my game when I'm done with it.

632
00:32:14,762 --> 00:32:15,683
I do a ton of that.

633
00:32:17,164 --> 00:32:20,147
I spend an awful lot of time, toward the end of the project,

634
00:32:20,187 --> 00:32:22,789
actually, recording B-roll, evaluating it,

635
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:23,930
and it's how I evaluate the game.

636
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:27,233
But yes, and I put all that stuff together,

637
00:32:27,253 --> 00:32:29,475
and I try to make it juicy and speedy.

638
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:31,397
And again, presentation, think about that.

639
00:32:31,457 --> 00:32:32,538
It's just like record.

640
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:34,999
go through and actually give it some video editing

641
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,401
to actually make it interesting and exciting.

642
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:40,762
And that's how I would probably show a full game,

643
00:32:40,802 --> 00:32:42,122
the same way we would do when we ship it.

644
00:32:42,902 --> 00:32:46,244
And just be careful to make sure you represent only your work.

645
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,505
That's really common is to yet.

646
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:50,406
wow, we did this thing and there were a bunch of us

647
00:32:50,466 --> 00:32:51,547
and look at what we all did.

648
00:32:51,587 --> 00:32:54,310
And then we were like, what did this person actually do?

649
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,552
What did you do is a really important question to ask.

650
00:32:57,652 --> 00:32:59,674
Probably the most important question to answer

651
00:33:00,215 --> 00:33:02,036
when it comes to portfolio is here's the things

652
00:33:02,096 --> 00:33:04,658
that I can do, you know, and make that hyper clear.

653
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:06,880
Because there's nothing worse than,

654
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,201
wow, this looks really good.

655
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:10,643
This junior person, a lot of potential.

656
00:33:11,084 --> 00:33:11,965
This looks really interesting.

657
00:33:12,005 --> 00:33:12,885
Let's get him on the phone.

658
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:15,508
And then you get, you know, get her on the phone

659
00:33:15,528 --> 00:33:16,769
or something and she's like, well, I.

660
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,695
I modeled the engines on the spaceship and you're like, no, you know, like you,

661
00:33:22,216 --> 00:33:24,859
I thought we were headed in a different place. Uh, and so it's really,

662
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:29,225
you have to be very careful to like represent yourself. Um, very,

663
00:33:29,285 --> 00:33:30,567
very carefully and appropriately for the,

664
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:34,492
just the things that you made and make that really clear. Thank you.

665
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:39,932
Hi, I'm Allie.

666
00:33:40,012 --> 00:33:40,833
Thanks for being here.

667
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:45,717
So I'm wondering if you think it's beneficial to sort of

668
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:50,040
gear your portfolio towards a certain role or a particular

669
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,381
position that you're looking for.

670
00:33:51,401 --> 00:33:56,286
And then also I'm curious if you have any tips for like a

671
00:33:56,346 --> 00:33:58,688
tech art portfolio and what you would

672
00:33:58,728 --> 00:33:59,768
expect to see on that.

673
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,181
I can answer the TechArt one.

674
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:06,722
Well, actually, I mean, I could probably dabble a little bit

675
00:34:06,762 --> 00:34:08,963
in both in the sense that you always

676
00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:10,943
want to be tailing your portfolio to who

677
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:12,004
you're applying for.

678
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:13,784
That's kind of portfolio 101.

679
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:16,945
And you have to be making those choices which

680
00:34:17,165 --> 00:34:19,366
are showing how you are relevant to the place

681
00:34:19,646 --> 00:34:21,347
and how interested you are in that place.

682
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:23,067
They make that really clear.

683
00:34:24,167 --> 00:34:26,408
Blanket single resume to 10 different companies

684
00:34:26,468 --> 00:34:27,328
is not a good idea.

685
00:34:27,348 --> 00:34:29,369
And by resume, I mean resume and the.

686
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:33,851
corresponding portfolio. As far as tech art, so first of all there are a lot of

687
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:37,872
different definitions of technical art. Some people consider tech art to be tech

688
00:34:37,972 --> 00:34:41,714
animation and that's a whole other ball of wax and has its own host of problems.

689
00:34:42,494 --> 00:34:46,735
So I'll just talk about you know how we at Epic anyway view technical art which

690
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:47,836
is basically like shaders.

691
00:34:48,656 --> 00:34:55,579
technical understanding of the rendering pipeline and basically how the you know artwork fits into that budgets would be another big one

692
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,220
Visual effects can be part of that

693
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:05,303
You know, there's technical VFX artists basically who are actually writing HLSL and stuff to do things. So I think

694
00:35:06,244 --> 00:35:11,208
The thing people forget when they make tech art portfolios is that they have to be technical

695
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:17,174
and an artist, and the artist one tends to kind of slough off the side over time.

696
00:35:17,194 --> 00:35:23,300
And what you're left behind is this shell of, you know, node-based scripting screenshots

697
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:26,804
and HLSL snippets, and you're like, I don't—does this person have a soul?

698
00:35:26,884 --> 00:35:27,405
I can't tell.

699
00:35:28,345 --> 00:35:29,867
You're interviewing a robot.

700
00:35:29,947 --> 00:35:30,908
Yes, yeah, totally.

701
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:34,071
That has basically almost happened, yeah.

702
00:35:34,491 --> 00:35:36,353
And so I feel like you really have

703
00:35:36,393 --> 00:35:38,595
to be careful to show that you are aesthetically

704
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:40,457
have something to say.

705
00:35:40,818 --> 00:35:42,880
And so even if that means you're just

706
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,462
taking something that's really beautiful, like a still image,

707
00:35:45,702 --> 00:35:47,604
and bringing it to life using all of these techniques

708
00:35:47,664 --> 00:35:50,827
like complex shaders, or effects, or I don't know.

709
00:35:52,629 --> 00:35:56,573
those kind of problems, make sure that the end result is pretty, is beautiful.

710
00:35:56,733 --> 00:35:59,476
Because those are the best technical artists are people who can,

711
00:36:00,016 --> 00:36:02,398
you have this really lovely vision, you can't quite pull it off.

712
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:05,381
So they pull the rabbit out of the hat and find a way.

713
00:36:05,701 --> 00:36:08,364
Like that's really the person you're trying to hire when you're trying to hire

714
00:36:08,384 --> 00:36:09,725
a tech artist is that person.

715
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:14,349
So don't abandon the visual side in favor of just showing that you know how to

716
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,151
string some HLS together or whatever.

717
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:17,572
Awesome, thank you.

718
00:36:17,733 --> 00:36:17,873
Yeah.

719
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:22,010
Hi, my name is Michal.

720
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,452
Really glad you guys are here and that you're doing this.

721
00:36:24,953 --> 00:36:26,574
I have two questions, if that's all right.

722
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:29,217
First one, is there anything that,

723
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:31,599
like if you see it in a portfolio,

724
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:33,721
makes you immediately move on to the next one?

725
00:36:34,262 --> 00:36:37,004
Like regardless of what field or what it's targeting?

726
00:36:38,346 --> 00:36:40,227
Like something that's just an absolute no-no.

727
00:36:45,104 --> 00:36:49,308
I mean, when I'm doing a portfolio review, first and foremost, I flip through it and

728
00:36:49,348 --> 00:36:53,112
people start panicking because they're like, but you're supposed to start with this one.

729
00:36:53,432 --> 00:36:55,734
But for me personally, I mean, I just, I go through it.

730
00:36:56,655 --> 00:37:00,419
I want to make sure that we gloss over, I mean, especially like today, for example,

731
00:37:00,579 --> 00:37:02,441
how many minutes do we have per person? 10.

732
00:37:03,464 --> 00:37:08,108
Right. So in 10 minutes, right, we've got to, you know, there's a lot of stuff to go over.

733
00:37:08,388 --> 00:37:17,957
Right. Now, are you talking about the context of a, you know, a piece that's offensive perhaps, or just not hitting the bar?

734
00:37:18,949 --> 00:37:23,915
either not hitting the bar or something that doesn't mesh with your company's standards?

735
00:37:24,355 --> 00:37:28,721
I mean, yeah, I mean, that happens all the time, but it's okay. You know, it's okay.

736
00:37:28,821 --> 00:37:34,588
You know, we, you know, you're going to course correct. I remember I went to Pixar. They

737
00:37:34,608 --> 00:37:36,991
invited me. I had my portfolio and they went through it.

738
00:37:37,572 --> 00:37:39,694
And it was all geared for illustration and they're like,

739
00:37:40,194 --> 00:37:42,617
and a totally different kind of style as well.

740
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:44,118
And they were like, you know, you've got your chops,

741
00:37:44,258 --> 00:37:47,101
but you know, come back in six months with a new portfolio

742
00:37:47,781 --> 00:37:50,504
and we'll consider looking at it again, you know.

743
00:37:52,007 --> 00:37:55,789
So I won't hire somebody that doesn't have any real time work.

744
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:01,813
So if you're an amazing sculptor or amazing, like, you know, high res asset

745
00:38:01,873 --> 00:38:04,955
creator, I need to see it in real time.

746
00:38:05,036 --> 00:38:08,518
Cause like really what I'm, I'm hiring is the problem solver, right?

747
00:38:08,558 --> 00:38:09,759
Like more than just an artist, like.

748
00:38:10,319 --> 00:38:14,686
I want to hire somebody that will join the team and help us create the next big thing,

749
00:38:14,866 --> 00:38:15,126
right?

750
00:38:15,247 --> 00:38:21,356
So if you don't show that potential in your portfolio, like you won't take that one step

751
00:38:21,536 --> 00:38:26,403
just to meet me halfway, then I pass immediately.

752
00:38:27,458 --> 00:38:31,899
I'll piggyback off of Moby's comment that I think it is abundantly clear when I see

753
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:34,440
a portfolio and do that initial quick flip.

754
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,802
If someone just has an illustration portfolio and they're applying for a concept art job,

755
00:38:38,862 --> 00:38:40,822
it's just a hard no immediately.

756
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:43,103
Even if they are so talented.

757
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:47,646
Illustration is a Venn diagram that overlaps with concept art.

758
00:38:47,666 --> 00:38:52,349
There's a lot of the same technical skills, but there are certain stylistic things and

759
00:38:52,389 --> 00:38:57,512
compositional things that are important in illustration that don't speak to the thought

760
00:38:57,552 --> 00:39:00,093
process and the actual concept side of concept art.

761
00:39:00,474 --> 00:39:03,195
So really being able to make that distinction is important.

762
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:08,379
And also the one hard line is, good God, if you have anything traced or stolen, we will

763
00:39:08,419 --> 00:39:08,639
know.

764
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,380
Do not do that.

765
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,601
That's such a red flag.

766
00:39:11,821 --> 00:39:13,703
I've had somebody apply to my...

767
00:39:14,283 --> 00:39:15,384
I'm a hiring manager.

768
00:39:15,404 --> 00:39:19,426
I've had somebody apply to one of my openings with my work in their portfolio.

769
00:39:21,928 --> 00:39:23,009
Do not steal my work.

770
00:39:25,774 --> 00:39:31,498
When I was at Microsoft, we were working with this studio making a game that I will not say the name of.

771
00:39:32,815 --> 00:39:35,617
but involved Western animals, so figure it out on your own.

772
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:38,400
And the first concept art they sent over to me,

773
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,381
and I was like, this looks familiar.

774
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:43,644
I pulled the Rango concept art book off of my shelf,

775
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,625
and they just traced Rango art

776
00:39:45,685 --> 00:39:47,086
and sent it over to Microsoft.

777
00:39:47,467 --> 00:39:48,587
And then, of course, they did the thing

778
00:39:48,608 --> 00:39:50,969
where they blamed it on an intern.

779
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:52,450
Oh, this poor intern did this.

780
00:39:52,911 --> 00:39:56,594
And it's just, we're all so well-versed in our industry

781
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,916
and in other industries that it's so immediately apparent

782
00:39:59,976 --> 00:40:00,537
if you are either,

783
00:40:02,047 --> 00:40:06,491
very closely aping someone's style to the point of plagiarism, or if you're just straight

784
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:07,352
tracing something.

785
00:40:07,372 --> 00:40:08,012
So don't do it.

786
00:40:08,132 --> 00:40:08,913
You're all good people.

787
00:40:09,213 --> 00:40:12,536
That is a lesson in how small the industry is.

788
00:40:13,116 --> 00:40:18,901
Something like that is a black mark on your reputation.

789
00:40:19,701 --> 00:40:22,464
Also incomplete work, that kind of stops me.

790
00:40:22,844 --> 00:40:25,206
Like if it's all gray box, if it's not intentional.

791
00:40:26,126 --> 00:40:29,007
it shouldn't be there. So if you didn't finish it

792
00:40:29,528 --> 00:40:33,409
and it happens to be the thing that's on the front page and it's like a gray

793
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:37,131
sculpt that's not done and it's like okay this is not there

794
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:41,333
so that would probably stop me. By the way somehow we have gone this long

795
00:40:41,633 --> 00:40:44,714
without telling everybody to delete half the stuff in their portfolio

796
00:40:44,834 --> 00:40:48,636
right now please. What's your fashion

797
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:49,737
quote they usually say?

798
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:53,453
Uh, oh, you mean as far as like the number jewelry or whatever?

799
00:40:53,813 --> 00:40:57,918
Like you, you go out, look up by the way, remove a piece of jewelry.

800
00:40:58,138 --> 00:40:59,840
One of you said the Coco Chanel.

801
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,303
I actually was Darren.

802
00:41:02,463 --> 00:41:02,623
Yeah.

803
00:41:02,723 --> 00:41:04,605
Yeah.

804
00:41:04,986 --> 00:41:06,147
I've never quoted Coco Chanel.

805
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:16,297
Well, I usually say delete your portfolio in half and then subtract one and that's how many pieces you're actually supposed to have in the

806
00:41:16,357 --> 00:41:21,922
Current portfolios that exists like it's so it's so common that you know you and you hide it all at the back

807
00:41:22,182 --> 00:41:25,965
That's always what happens is you got a couple of strong things and then a portfolio just kind of

808
00:41:26,366 --> 00:41:30,711
dwindles off toward the end and then you're stuck with a bunch of stuff that shouldn't really be in there in the first place.

809
00:41:31,211 --> 00:41:37,299
It's so much better to show a couple of really high-value things than it is to show us even one

810
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:41,263
that's not high-value because now we start to question your taste. Do they know it's not good?

811
00:41:41,604 --> 00:41:45,446
Are they aware? Are they a little ashamed of it? Is that why it's in the back? Is there some situation?

812
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:48,469
What's going on here? I'd rather see three amazing things.

813
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:53,272
And I tell this story every year, but we hired an environment artist who had three pieces in his portfolio.

814
00:41:53,492 --> 00:41:58,576
He had three pictures. And he's a junior guy, amazing three images, and we hired him.

815
00:41:59,056 --> 00:42:03,960
So it doesn't take much. You just have to have really good taste in those three images, and we're going to notice.

816
00:42:05,741 --> 00:42:07,122
Do I have time to ask my other question?

817
00:42:09,286 --> 00:42:09,566
Why not?

818
00:42:09,606 --> 00:42:10,067
I'm curious.

819
00:42:10,747 --> 00:42:11,068
Sorry.

820
00:42:11,088 --> 00:42:12,269
We've got the room a little longer.

821
00:42:12,289 --> 00:42:14,290
I'm just curious.

822
00:42:15,992 --> 00:42:19,615
Is there anything you'd look for specifically in an animation

823
00:42:19,755 --> 00:42:21,536
demo reel for games?

824
00:42:21,577 --> 00:42:24,479
Like, I know that you've been talking a lot about the artistic

825
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:26,281
side and rendering in real time.

826
00:42:26,321 --> 00:42:29,283
And I was wondering what an animator would

827
00:42:29,323 --> 00:42:31,925
want to present to, specifically, a game company.

828
00:42:33,367 --> 00:42:34,027
In-engine work.

829
00:42:34,734 --> 00:42:35,915
is extremely important.

830
00:42:36,836 --> 00:42:39,038
And when you get an animation portfolio,

831
00:42:39,138 --> 00:42:41,620
even from guys who have been in the industry for 30 years

832
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,902
who are in their entire portfolio is just cinematic work,

833
00:42:45,342 --> 00:42:48,845
that's really hard to judge because game animation

834
00:42:48,985 --> 00:42:51,467
is such a specific beast compared to cinematic.

835
00:42:51,927 --> 00:42:55,050
So I think you can have absolutely have some acting work

836
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:57,932
in your reel because that's relevant to do games

837
00:42:57,972 --> 00:42:59,353
with cut scenes and things like that,

838
00:42:59,373 --> 00:43:00,734
but really showing that you know.

839
00:43:01,895 --> 00:43:05,536
how to animate a character, how to do run cycles, how to actually move them through a space,

840
00:43:06,177 --> 00:43:10,778
and that you're aware of how characters look and animate from the angle that they're intended to

841
00:43:10,818 --> 00:43:15,040
be in a game. So how you're animating a character for Assassin's Creed isn't going to be different

842
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,122
from how you're animating a character in Dota 2 or something.

843
00:43:18,524 --> 00:43:24,386
If you've seen a first-person animation, like if you go and watch the talks on Overwatch for how they're doing, what they're doing,

844
00:43:25,546 --> 00:43:31,428
the hoops they jump through to make it look right makes the animations absolutely absurd.

845
00:43:32,629 --> 00:43:37,630
Just bonkers choices with arms that are 33 feet long and stretched out into the perspective of the camera.

846
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:40,691
So that's a really good exercise too if you're talking about game animation,

847
00:43:41,091 --> 00:43:45,432
is really, like you said, pick something that's in context of actually how games are made

848
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,373
and then animate to that standard.

849
00:43:47,773 --> 00:43:50,334
And then if somebody's reviewing portfolio sees that,

850
00:43:50,634 --> 00:43:54,074
they're going to see that, oh, you're thinking a little bit further than just the,

851
00:43:54,415 --> 00:43:58,736
you know, moving from pose to pose or whatever it is that you're doing from day to day on the animation side,

852
00:43:58,996 --> 00:44:02,077
that you're actually starting to make some relevant choices to making the product.

853
00:44:02,477 --> 00:44:04,597
That is always going to win out a little bit over,

854
00:44:04,617 --> 00:44:06,938
I can just make a pretty run cycle or whatever.

855
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:12,501
That's one thing that always has bothered me about animation portfolios, is that an animator doesn't consider where the camera is.

856
00:44:12,741 --> 00:44:12,941
Yeah.

857
00:44:13,121 --> 00:44:17,244
Like, you know, like, for God's sake, put it in perspective, right?

858
00:44:17,304 --> 00:44:23,267
Like, do something, like, give it, it goes back to that presentation, like that little bit of consideration, your camera,

859
00:44:23,908 --> 00:44:30,611
if your work is just as good as the third animator that applied for the job that day, but you considered your cameras...

860
00:44:31,964 --> 00:44:35,206
little bit is going to make you look better than that person that was just as good as

861
00:44:35,226 --> 00:44:35,386
you.

862
00:44:35,646 --> 00:44:35,846
Yeah.

863
00:44:36,046 --> 00:44:36,266
Right?

864
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:37,967
And that's that edge that you need.

865
00:44:37,987 --> 00:44:42,049
So it's that presentation and thinking about that and how you show your work.

866
00:44:43,249 --> 00:44:46,571
Just giving it that little extra thought is huge.

867
00:44:47,711 --> 00:44:48,211
One other thing.

868
00:44:48,231 --> 00:44:53,854
I mean, this is not a plug for my friend, but one of my coworkers, Rory Alderson, he

869
00:44:53,894 --> 00:44:55,775
does a lot of things on YouTube.

870
00:44:57,556 --> 00:45:01,582
He, just like what you guys are all talking about, you know, the context, but he's actually

871
00:45:01,602 --> 00:45:07,790
going, he's going, repairing old assets and bringing them, giving them, you know, new

872
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:10,134
flourish and a new fresh perspective.

873
00:45:10,314 --> 00:45:14,340
So he's a person that you might want to look at in that context.

874
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:21,891
I will say that thinking about the camera is also relevant for any other job in the

875
00:45:21,971 --> 00:45:24,612
industry, especially from a character design standpoint.

876
00:45:24,632 --> 00:45:28,954
A lot of times you'll see these beautiful character designs in a void, but if they are

877
00:45:28,974 --> 00:45:34,216
meant to be seen from a top-down orthographic view, you need to completely rethink that

878
00:45:34,296 --> 00:45:36,977
color blocking and how they read from that angle.

879
00:45:37,397 --> 00:45:40,638
There's a reason why a lot of Assassin's Creed characters have...

880
00:45:40,919 --> 00:45:46,322
cool backs and interesting cloaks because it makes it interesting for the 90% of the

881
00:45:46,342 --> 00:45:47,963
time that you're running away from the camera.

882
00:45:48,384 --> 00:45:53,687
It's really keeping that in mind in a way that character design in film is very different

883
00:45:53,707 --> 00:45:57,630
from character design in games and knowing that difference really shows if you show that

884
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:58,290
in your concepts.

885
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:01,312
All right, thank you so much.

886
00:46:01,332 --> 00:46:01,613
Hello.

887
00:46:01,653 --> 00:46:01,733
So

888
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:10,773
Earlier you mentioned that it's not so much the resume,

889
00:46:11,274 --> 00:46:13,796
it's more the portfolio that you guys look at in the work.

890
00:46:15,578 --> 00:46:18,961
However, what if I'm applying to be a concept artist,

891
00:46:19,261 --> 00:46:20,763
my portfolio says concept artist,

892
00:46:21,043 --> 00:46:23,926
my LinkedIn says I'm in hospitality and accounting.

893
00:46:25,387 --> 00:46:27,589
Do I just clear out all that work history,

894
00:46:28,069 --> 00:46:30,051
even though I have zero professional experience?

895
00:46:30,332 --> 00:46:30,532
Fine.

896
00:46:31,172 --> 00:46:33,675
I mean, at the end of the day, if the work's good, the work's good.

897
00:46:33,975 --> 00:46:38,439
You know, I mean, I've hired people from a Walmart before, you know,

898
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,703
just because like you're working in hospitality doesn't mean that you're not badass, you know.

899
00:46:43,504 --> 00:46:45,205
So, I mean, it's relevant.

900
00:46:45,245 --> 00:46:46,246
You're still working with people.

901
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:49,249
You're doing, you're probably dealing with customers and stuff like that.

902
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:52,051
But really, I mean, I always look at the work first and.

903
00:46:52,472 --> 00:46:54,613
Yeah, the bottom line is I'm not going to look at your LinkedIn

904
00:46:54,633 --> 00:46:56,614
until I've already looked at your portfolio two or three

905
00:46:56,634 --> 00:46:56,894
times.

906
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,696
And so if I like your work enough to do that,

907
00:46:59,736 --> 00:47:00,416
I don't really care.

908
00:47:01,917 --> 00:47:03,038
When I go to your LinkedIn, I'm looking

909
00:47:03,058 --> 00:47:06,520
to see did you jump jobs every three months?

910
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:09,041
Or did you sustain something?

911
00:47:09,402 --> 00:47:11,003
Did you work in hospitality for three years?

912
00:47:12,443 --> 00:47:13,684
I'm more concerned about that than I am

913
00:47:13,704 --> 00:47:14,805
that you worked in hospitality.

914
00:47:16,206 --> 00:47:18,167
But again, I'm not getting there if your work isn't there.

915
00:47:18,187 --> 00:47:19,287
It doesn't matter.

916
00:47:20,308 --> 00:47:20,548
Thank you.

917
00:47:22,487 --> 00:47:22,868
Hello.

918
00:47:23,348 --> 00:47:23,648
Hello.

919
00:47:24,669 --> 00:47:26,071
I was just curious, so like,

920
00:47:26,631 --> 00:47:29,594
what technical requirements do concept artists need

921
00:47:29,674 --> 00:47:31,176
to show in their portfolio,

922
00:47:31,236 --> 00:47:34,178
like stuff like thumbnailing and like rendering,

923
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,020
in order to show like, we're ready.

924
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,163
We're ready for the iterative production path

925
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:40,164
that is concept art?

926
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:42,847
The tech.

927
00:47:44,088 --> 00:47:46,550
Well, this, I mean, why don't you guys go ahead.

928
00:47:48,403 --> 00:47:52,287
I will say it is a mixed bag what people want to see in portfolios.

929
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:56,092
I've definitely heard people say that they don't want to see any process in portfolios

930
00:47:56,132 --> 00:47:56,572
whatsoever.

931
00:47:57,153 --> 00:47:58,194
I love seeing process.

932
00:47:58,595 --> 00:47:59,416
Me too.

933
00:47:59,436 --> 00:48:00,036
Within reason.

934
00:48:00,056 --> 00:48:00,637
Same.

935
00:48:00,657 --> 00:48:03,400
I love seeing thumbnailing, color blocking.

936
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:11,607
If you show that process and I can see like, oh, oh, it got stronger each time and you were making smart decisions.

937
00:48:11,727 --> 00:48:16,090
Don't put in process if your sketches are better than your final because it's a bad look.

938
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:22,234
I don't necessarily think I am not a subscriber to the idea that more is better.

939
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:26,477
Sometimes concepts need a hundred iterations, sometimes they need two or three.

940
00:48:27,157 --> 00:48:31,399
So just showing that natural process, not feeling like, oh, I have to draw a whole page

941
00:48:31,439 --> 00:48:32,160
of silhouettes.

942
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:36,242
It's like, because sometimes the work that you're putting in is on the research side

943
00:48:36,262 --> 00:48:41,385
of things, is in your head, and if you put down three silhouettes, and then you narrow

944
00:48:41,405 --> 00:48:45,867
it down, start refining that, seeing that process, seeing that you were thinking through

945
00:48:45,907 --> 00:48:47,828
that is super valuable to me.

946
00:48:50,277 --> 00:48:54,680
I mean, I think that's a misconception as a concept artist is that all day, every day,

947
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:59,162
you're making this great polished piece of art, you know, when really the majority of

948
00:48:59,182 --> 00:49:02,864
the time, correct me if I'm out of concept artists, but yeah, you're making, you're basically

949
00:49:02,904 --> 00:49:08,207
making ugly sketches with an art director to like get a problem solved, right?

950
00:49:08,287 --> 00:49:11,949
And showing like your work and showing that you can solve those problems and work with

951
00:49:12,209 --> 00:49:14,690
like an art director to, you know, get.

952
00:49:15,991 --> 00:49:17,573
Get a problem solved.

953
00:49:17,613 --> 00:49:20,335
I think Claire touched on this earlier about concept

954
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:21,035
and illustration.

955
00:49:22,897 --> 00:49:26,380
Illustration can frequently masquerade as concept.

956
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,001
Concept solves problems.

957
00:49:29,943 --> 00:49:31,704
It's great that you make a really polished render,

958
00:49:31,744 --> 00:49:33,506
but how did you do it?

959
00:49:33,586 --> 00:49:35,127
Show me you can think.

960
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:39,270
It's a really hard job, and it's a totally different muscle.

961
00:49:40,031 --> 00:49:42,613
So understanding that difference.

962
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:48,361
That doesn't mean illustration doesn't have a place in the process, but understanding

963
00:49:48,382 --> 00:49:51,223
that that's what we're hiring is important.

964
00:49:51,943 --> 00:49:52,844
Yeah, critical thinking.

965
00:49:52,964 --> 00:49:53,204
Go ahead.

966
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:53,804
No, go.

967
00:49:53,984 --> 00:49:59,167
Oh, no, but just as far as it shows us critical thinking and, you know, the amount of silhouette

968
00:49:59,207 --> 00:50:04,169
studies that we do, it's, I mean, there are hundreds before we even start filling in the

969
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:05,310
interior shapes.

970
00:50:06,231 --> 00:50:11,613
And then, you know, just going forward from there, you know, until we end up even at color.

971
00:50:11,653 --> 00:50:11,893
We don't.

972
00:50:12,622 --> 00:50:14,363
Like, I'll actually, when I'm building a game,

973
00:50:14,784 --> 00:50:17,966
there's no color for at least four or five months

974
00:50:18,707 --> 00:50:19,608
in the world itself.

975
00:50:19,828 --> 00:50:21,089
There'll be material renderings,

976
00:50:21,129 --> 00:50:22,370
the characters will be running around

977
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:24,011
making idiots out of themselves,

978
00:50:24,832 --> 00:50:26,653
but at the end of the day,

979
00:50:27,094 --> 00:50:30,036
everything is done with read hierarchy in mind.

980
00:50:30,196 --> 00:50:33,459
But yeah, back to the point, yeah,

981
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,801
showing that process all the way through.

982
00:50:35,821 --> 00:50:38,603
And then, I mean, the color's kind of the icing on the cake,

983
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:40,545
that final polished piece, right?

984
00:50:40,565 --> 00:50:41,566
That's kind of the fun part.

985
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:43,490
So, yeah.

986
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:44,450
Perfect.

987
00:50:45,471 --> 00:50:46,291
Cool.

988
00:50:46,492 --> 00:50:47,832
What advice do you have for someone

989
00:50:47,852 --> 00:50:49,774
who wants to make their demo reel pop?

990
00:50:49,794 --> 00:50:51,635
Because you mentioned earlier that environments

991
00:50:51,695 --> 00:50:53,736
are a bit hard to get right with a demo reel.

992
00:50:57,819 --> 00:50:59,900
I mean, again, I would go with telling a story, right?

993
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,302
So if you are doing a demo reel, I

994
00:51:03,162 --> 00:51:05,244
would have that as a last resort.

995
00:51:05,284 --> 00:51:05,924
I mean, Greg can.

996
00:51:06,518 --> 00:51:07,939
Greg knows more than I do about that.

997
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:11,320
But really, like stills of your image

998
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,840
really tell a story about the setting,

999
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,561
the world that pulls people in will always

1000
00:51:15,601 --> 00:51:18,122
put you above somebody that knows Substance Painter

1001
00:51:18,142 --> 00:51:20,282
and they can make a nice corridor or something

1002
00:51:20,302 --> 00:51:20,983
like that, right?

1003
00:51:21,063 --> 00:51:25,024
So yeah, really make it like a narrative experience.

1004
00:51:25,184 --> 00:51:28,525
Have it be a story, right?

1005
00:51:28,645 --> 00:51:30,105
And that'll make it better.

1006
00:51:30,185 --> 00:51:30,745
If it's for your.

1007
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:35,955
your demo reel. I mean, I would cater any camera work to that. And I mean, Greg's the master of

1008
00:51:35,995 --> 00:51:38,543
that, but I would, I would really.

1009
00:51:39,104 --> 00:51:41,626
If you're going to do that, make sure you pay attention to your cameras.

1010
00:51:41,646 --> 00:51:45,550
Don't just do this like straight, you know, pan down a hallway.

1011
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:49,213
Like you have to like make it worth why I'm watching a video.

1012
00:51:49,313 --> 00:51:51,575
You know, that comes down to the comment earlier of make a choice.

1013
00:51:52,016 --> 00:51:53,317
Just kind of choose something

1014
00:51:53,337 --> 00:51:56,760
that is a little bit past just the setting of the place itself.

1015
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,143
And one really thing that can be really valuable for an environment

1016
00:52:00,203 --> 00:52:02,705
if you're stuck, if you don't know what to do, just ask yourself

1017
00:52:02,805 --> 00:52:03,726
what happened there 100 years ago.

1018
00:52:04,767 --> 00:52:05,928
what happened there 10 years ago,

1019
00:52:06,408 --> 00:52:07,289
what happened there last year,

1020
00:52:07,309 --> 00:52:08,770
and then what happened there five minutes ago.

1021
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:12,413
If you could fill in, answer those questions in that image,

1022
00:52:12,833 --> 00:52:14,334
then the viewer is going to feel like

1023
00:52:14,374 --> 00:52:15,695
those questions are answered too,

1024
00:52:16,096 --> 00:52:17,216
and then you can start to feel like

1025
00:52:17,236 --> 00:52:18,598
the place is alive a little bit.

1026
00:52:19,118 --> 00:52:20,319
That's a really nice way.

1027
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:21,900
If you're stuck, if you don't know what to choose,

1028
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,922
just go through a little thought exercise like that,

1029
00:52:24,042 --> 00:52:25,203
and then ask yourself, well,

1030
00:52:25,223 --> 00:52:25,743
this hallway,

1031
00:52:26,223 --> 00:52:28,925
Did somebody just walk down here dragging an axe on the floor?

1032
00:52:28,985 --> 00:52:30,165
Why is there a gouge mark?

1033
00:52:30,505 --> 00:52:32,446
Like just little things, make little choices,

1034
00:52:32,586 --> 00:52:35,508
and then those will come through in the final image.

1035
00:52:38,689 --> 00:52:40,310
Sorry, I'm not cutting off anyone, am I?

1036
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:45,733
Do you think it would be better to just omit a reel

1037
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:47,874
if you don't think it adds anything to your portfolio?

1038
00:52:48,094 --> 00:52:48,254
Yep.

1039
00:52:48,494 --> 00:52:49,234
Yeah, absolutely.

1040
00:52:50,475 --> 00:52:50,815
Yes.

1041
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:52,256
Simple answer, yes.

1042
00:52:53,096 --> 00:52:53,236
Thanks.

1043
00:52:53,276 --> 00:52:53,977
It was for animation.

1044
00:52:54,077 --> 00:52:54,197
Yeah.

1045
00:52:54,257 --> 00:52:54,497
Generally.

1046
00:52:56,139 --> 00:53:02,507
I actually if you want to look it up, I have an article called why I hate demo reels. It's about a three page rant. So

1047
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:11,039
Yeah, exactly yeah, I think it's they're probably it's probably plastered on some lamppost outside

1048
00:53:13,162 --> 00:53:13,442
Thank you

1049
00:53:14,202 --> 00:53:14,463
Go ahead.

1050
00:53:15,323 --> 00:53:17,826
First off, I also went to the Art Institute,

1051
00:53:17,926 --> 00:53:19,648
so it means a lot seeing you up there.

1052
00:53:20,749 --> 00:53:26,135
But I was wondering how you guys consolidate clicks with content.

1053
00:53:26,155 --> 00:53:27,896
Because say, if I have an environment

1054
00:53:27,916 --> 00:53:32,241
and I have all these breakdowns, if there's three environments

1055
00:53:32,301 --> 00:53:34,263
and all the breakdowns are on my landing page,

1056
00:53:34,403 --> 00:53:36,906
obviously it's not going to load and it's going to be cluttered.

1057
00:53:37,606 --> 00:53:45,510
So how do you make that consolidation between organization and being too much to look like to click through right the flowchart?

1058
00:53:45,711 --> 00:53:45,911
right

1059
00:53:48,712 --> 00:53:54,495
Like that I mean for me like with my my website is pretty straightforward like I just put everything you know

1060
00:53:54,535 --> 00:53:57,357
But they're all categorized into what I've worked on in the past

1061
00:53:58,698 --> 00:54:02,120
But yeah, just creating a flow chart that's going to make sense to people,

1062
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:08,445
you know, and just making it very simple and not an elaborate kind of experience.

1063
00:54:09,542 --> 00:54:14,604
I guess if the beauty shot is the gallery, you get 10 of those.

1064
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:16,805
And when you click on it, then the deeper stuff is there.

1065
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:20,847
So you don't overwhelm the person with like choices and stuff.

1066
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,827
You don't want to get bombarded.

1067
00:54:21,847 --> 00:54:25,889
So if you've got enough work to have like four or five environments, let's say,

1068
00:54:26,609 --> 00:54:29,851
and then you click on it and when you click on it, it drops you down into like

1069
00:54:29,931 --> 00:54:32,612
the deeper stuff that's, you know, you've got me now.

1070
00:54:33,552 --> 00:54:35,354
It's just you want to get them to click on it.

1071
00:54:36,075 --> 00:54:37,676
So once you've clicked on it, then I'm

1072
00:54:37,696 --> 00:54:38,597
going to keep scrolling.

1073
00:54:38,857 --> 00:54:40,939
So that's kind of the way to go at it, I guess.

1074
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,141
OK, thank you.

1075
00:54:44,522 --> 00:54:45,723
Thank you guys so much for coming.

1076
00:54:47,004 --> 00:54:47,805
My question is.

1077
00:54:49,404 --> 00:54:51,946
As a modeler, you're in the middle of the pipeline,

1078
00:54:52,106 --> 00:54:54,728
and you want to show that you can make decisions,

1079
00:54:54,748 --> 00:54:56,509
like you guys were saying, but you also

1080
00:54:56,569 --> 00:54:59,111
want to show that, hey, I can take a concept that someone

1081
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:00,713
else made and interpret that.

1082
00:55:00,733 --> 00:55:01,894
So how do you balance that?

1083
00:55:02,794 --> 00:55:04,736
I can make my own decisions, and also,

1084
00:55:04,816 --> 00:55:07,678
if someone gives me a concept, I can execute that kind of thing.

1085
00:55:10,889 --> 00:55:14,172
I mean, so I guess as like a lead or an art director,

1086
00:55:14,192 --> 00:55:17,755
like usually what I'll try to do is have, you know,

1087
00:55:18,596 --> 00:55:21,338
a good concept artist, such as Claire,

1088
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:24,661
will give you a lot of reference to pull from, right?

1089
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:29,005
And that'll start inspiring you to make decisions

1090
00:55:29,045 --> 00:55:30,506
based off of those concepts, right?

1091
00:55:30,526 --> 00:55:34,110
So when we were working on like Liz or like Lutece twins

1092
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:34,830
and stuff like that.

1093
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:40,468
we're pulling from the same reference, but we're also innovating based on what the concept has.

1094
00:55:40,888 --> 00:55:45,571
It's really the guideline, and once we start getting it in game, how can we put our own twist

1095
00:55:45,631 --> 00:55:51,794
onto this so that it renders well, it's unique in the world and stuff like that. So I think

1096
00:55:52,255 --> 00:55:59,218
the first, to get your foot in, or I guess the first things you can do is start finding opportunities.

1097
00:55:59,739 --> 00:56:02,243
maybe of obscurity where you can innovate, right?

1098
00:56:02,263 --> 00:56:04,967
So if there's a concept that's like more rough,

1099
00:56:05,087 --> 00:56:07,070
it's like, what can you do to interpret that

1100
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:08,632
in a way that fits the world,

1101
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:11,978
like fits the project pillars and like moves things forward?

1102
00:56:12,198 --> 00:56:14,942
And then from there you'll start getting more and more,

1103
00:56:15,002 --> 00:56:15,203
you know.

1104
00:56:15,683 --> 00:56:20,108
Pieces of the pie and interpretation is a great word there because that's another way to take it as well

1105
00:56:20,148 --> 00:56:23,711
Which is hey somebody gave me this amazing concept of a sci-fi crate

1106
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:28,216
I don't know and I'm gonna reproduce that thing to death. I'm gonna kill it

1107
00:56:28,236 --> 00:56:31,579
That thing is gonna look exactly the way it was art direct and yes nailed it

1108
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,082
But then if you could go and make some variants, okay

1109
00:56:34,662 --> 00:56:39,005
and then they're all there together in the scene and you show this on the pedestal,

1110
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:43,687
ah, I made, I did the thing and then around it you're saying, oh, and I understood why the thing

1111
00:56:43,747 --> 00:56:47,709
existed and so I was able to intuit the shape language and the forms and the ideas and the

1112
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:52,232
details and then go and invent something similar or tangential to it and show those two.

1113
00:56:52,792 --> 00:56:54,954
and call that out, I think that would be really appealing,

1114
00:56:55,075 --> 00:56:56,176
particularly for somebody junior,

1115
00:56:56,216 --> 00:56:57,477
where you wouldn't always expect them

1116
00:56:57,557 --> 00:56:58,758
to kind of take that leap.

1117
00:56:59,319 --> 00:57:02,762
I think that would be a leap ahead territory for us,

1118
00:57:03,202 --> 00:57:04,223
looking at the portfolio.

1119
00:57:04,263 --> 00:57:06,485
That would show some good strength, right?

1120
00:57:08,487 --> 00:57:08,768
Thank you.

1121
00:57:08,908 --> 00:57:09,468
Great.

1122
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:10,249
Go ahead.

1123
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:12,092
Yeah, hi, my name's Gerald.

1124
00:57:12,272 --> 00:57:15,957
I'm graduating this spring from a game program, if you will.

1125
00:57:16,718 --> 00:57:19,921
My concern is that the program has more of like a broad range

1126
00:57:19,982 --> 00:57:22,545
of skills it's been teaching, so not just like game or game

1127
00:57:22,565 --> 00:57:25,528
design, but also like app development, and virtual

1128
00:57:25,548 --> 00:57:28,912
reality, and website design, and coding, and just like a

1129
00:57:28,972 --> 00:57:29,913
broad range of things, right?

1130
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:35,217
So for the artifacts that I have for my portfolio,

1131
00:57:35,737 --> 00:57:38,839
it kind of reflects all of that instead of one narrow focus.

1132
00:57:39,299 --> 00:57:42,221
So what are your thoughts on having

1133
00:57:42,261 --> 00:57:44,162
more of a general portfolio, as I've described,

1134
00:57:44,222 --> 00:57:45,643
to being more narrowly focused?

1135
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:47,664
Thanks.

1136
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:55,055
So I mean, I think like most schools, they're really giving you like a primer onto like,

1137
00:57:55,175 --> 00:57:58,957
here's a, here's an appetizer for all the different things that you could do it with

1138
00:57:58,977 --> 00:57:59,638
your career.

1139
00:57:59,758 --> 00:57:59,978
Right.

1140
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:04,500
But I think the better choice would be to find what you're most passionate about and

1141
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,321
just go all in on that.

1142
00:58:06,461 --> 00:58:06,661
Right.

1143
00:58:06,681 --> 00:58:07,982
Like having a general portfolio.

1144
00:58:08,682 --> 00:58:13,828
You know, we do hire generalists, like there's smaller studios, indie studios, it's way more common.

1145
00:58:14,308 --> 00:58:21,155
But when you're spread so far, like I've never hired a website designer and a scripter and a modeler,

1146
00:58:21,275 --> 00:58:23,518
and, you know, like all in one person, you know what I mean?

1147
00:58:23,638 --> 00:58:28,463
So I think the more you focus, the more, the better you'll get, the quicker you'll get better.

1148
00:58:28,703 --> 00:58:30,024
And it's generally just the...

1149
00:58:30,665 --> 00:58:36,769
Better move. Okay. Yeah, the key is when you know, you're gonna become a generalist later on down the line

1150
00:58:36,929 --> 00:58:39,231
Like you're gonna when I started, you know

1151
00:58:40,272 --> 00:58:46,796
Valve for example. Yeah, it was just you know working on character development, but you know initially, you know

1152
00:58:47,197 --> 00:58:48,377
foundational skills and

1153
00:58:49,558 --> 00:58:51,940
you know, learning how to draw in general, right?

1154
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,441
Like getting at least good enough

1155
00:58:53,701 --> 00:58:57,143
at those foundational places, color theory.

1156
00:58:57,223 --> 00:58:58,284
Like that was a big one too.

1157
00:58:58,344 --> 00:59:00,305
And then using that for those five years

1158
00:59:00,445 --> 00:59:02,926
and really getting a firm foundation there.

1159
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:06,969
And then I could go in and learn level design and, you know,

1160
00:59:07,289 --> 00:59:09,971
learn just all the tastes, you know, ZBrush,

1161
00:59:12,192 --> 00:59:13,353
general modeling as well.

1162
00:59:13,693 --> 00:59:13,853
So.

1163
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:17,647
But yeah, generalist, I mean, that's something at least

1164
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:19,588
for me happens a little bit further on down the line.

1165
00:59:21,169 --> 00:59:23,411
So then real quick, just to cap on that,

1166
00:59:23,671 --> 00:59:25,492
if I wanted to go more towards the direction

1167
00:59:25,512 --> 00:59:26,973
of game design or narrative design,

1168
00:59:27,393 --> 00:59:29,795
I probably shouldn't want to include like the 3D models

1169
00:59:29,855 --> 00:59:30,715
that I've been doing in my.

1170
00:59:31,716 --> 00:59:35,338
I mean, I think the difference with like Moby too

1171
00:59:35,559 --> 00:59:37,260
is that he became like.

1172
00:59:38,655 --> 00:59:44,845
Legendary like one thing and then like started learning other skills from there, but right now it's not meant to

1173
00:59:45,806 --> 00:59:46,908
Not being an asshole or anything

1174
00:59:46,948 --> 00:59:52,877
but like a lot of a lot of students will end up being not good at a lot of things right and like

1175
00:59:53,378 --> 00:59:56,560
what you need to do is be really good at one thing to be hireable.

1176
00:59:56,901 --> 00:59:59,503
And from there, you can branch out and learn other things.

1177
00:59:59,543 --> 01:00:00,484
Like, I...

1178
01:00:00,904 --> 01:00:03,566
Like, the reason why I'm such good friends with Wyeth

1179
01:00:03,606 --> 01:00:06,208
is that I'm bugging him about, like, scripting stuff in Unreal, right?

1180
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:08,190
So, you know, while I'm doing character modeling, I'm like,

1181
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,111
hey, how do you do something in Blueprints?

1182
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:10,731
You know what I mean?

1183
01:00:10,912 --> 01:00:12,573
So, eventually you'll learn those things,

1184
01:00:12,593 --> 01:00:15,215
but the main objective is getting hired.

1185
01:00:15,335 --> 01:00:15,475
So...

1186
01:00:16,676 --> 01:00:20,478
Junior, super junior generalists basically don't exist.

1187
01:00:21,299 --> 01:00:21,499
Yeah.

1188
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:22,259
They just don't.

1189
01:00:22,779 --> 01:00:26,361
One of my good friends, he started at Riot.

1190
01:00:26,381 --> 01:00:27,302
He went to Art Center.

1191
01:00:28,142 --> 01:00:31,584
He's been working at Riot for about, I think, seven or eight years now.

1192
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,706
And within the last year, he's learning Unreal.

1193
01:00:35,387 --> 01:00:38,028
And he's actually building his own game on the side.

1194
01:00:39,229 --> 01:00:42,030
And that takes a lot of dexterity and knowledge.

1195
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:43,491
But he had that foundation.

1196
01:00:43,511 --> 01:00:44,432
Okay.

1197
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:46,470
Well, I appreciate your frankness and thanks for being here.

1198
01:00:46,550 --> 01:00:46,830
Thank you.

1199
01:00:46,930 --> 01:00:49,431
Absolutely.

1200
01:00:49,451 --> 01:00:49,991
Hi.

1201
01:00:50,791 --> 01:00:54,932
You guys talked at the beginning about the importance of having your own voice

1202
01:00:55,012 --> 01:00:58,693
and the importance of having research outside of the art world when you're doing your work,

1203
01:00:58,773 --> 01:01:00,853
and I found that to be very, very true in the work I've done.

1204
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:06,095
A lot of my best stuff has come from historical research or other things that aren't from ArtStation.

1205
01:01:07,035 --> 01:01:11,216
But at the same time, portfolios are supposed to be carefully trimmed to be just right.

1206
01:01:11,296 --> 01:01:13,856
So, do you guys like seeing evidence of that research?

1207
01:01:14,777 --> 01:01:20,802
in our portfolio posts themselves, or do you like to be self-evident from our beauty shots

1208
01:01:20,862 --> 01:01:21,523
and things like that?

1209
01:01:23,385 --> 01:01:23,925
Interesting.

1210
01:01:25,086 --> 01:01:30,651
I feel like generally I would want to see the evidence of that research in your work

1211
01:01:30,732 --> 01:01:34,515
in the same way that instead of including life drawing in your portfolio, it should

1212
01:01:34,535 --> 01:01:35,936
be evident in your character work.

1213
01:01:37,354 --> 01:01:43,677
I wouldn't kick it out of bed for eating crackers if I saw a couple reference images within

1214
01:01:43,717 --> 01:01:47,239
a larger sheet of thumbnails, just to sort of understand where your head's at.

1215
01:01:47,619 --> 01:01:50,820
I don't necessarily think you need to do a deep dive into your research process.

1216
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:55,402
You can kind of include in the notes that you were looking at a certain culture or a

1217
01:01:55,443 --> 01:01:58,684
certain time period or a certain type of rock formation.

1218
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:04,316
Yeah, and we understand, like, if you're coming out of school, like, this is, that's not plagiarism, right?

1219
01:02:04,336 --> 01:02:10,923
You're, you're just taking your reference shots and you're gleaning and then you're going to tinker from there and, and, and make it your own, right?

1220
01:02:11,564 --> 01:02:12,105
We all do it.

1221
01:02:12,125 --> 01:02:15,889
All right, awesome. Thank you very much.

1222
01:02:16,289 --> 01:02:16,469
Go ahead.

1223
01:02:17,398 --> 01:02:17,518
Hi.

1224
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:20,580
I'm more into the programming and game design

1225
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,982
sort of side of the game dev stuff.

1226
01:02:23,282 --> 01:02:24,883
And I've built a ton of prototypes

1227
01:02:24,903 --> 01:02:26,564
just sort of figuring out little mechanics here and there.

1228
01:02:27,084 --> 01:02:28,625
And I was wondering, I've been seeing

1229
01:02:28,645 --> 01:02:31,007
that it's kind of hard to show it off in a portfolio

1230
01:02:31,067 --> 01:02:32,408
just because they're little snippets

1231
01:02:32,468 --> 01:02:34,949
and people might not really understand what they would

1232
01:02:34,989 --> 01:02:37,311
be exactly just by themselves.

1233
01:02:37,431 --> 01:02:38,612
So I was wondering if you have any tips

1234
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:43,095
for building a portfolio for just little prototypes

1235
01:02:43,135 --> 01:02:44,035
for games and stuff like that.

1236
01:02:45,944 --> 01:02:48,948
Would that be dealing with level design or just the game itself?

1237
01:02:49,669 --> 01:02:54,255
Just for the game itself, like I have a, like just building out a really short prototype

1238
01:02:54,275 --> 01:02:58,040
for like an idea I might have in Unity, like, oh this sort of mechanic could work,

1239
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,482
so I want to try to see if I could do that.

1240
01:03:00,162 --> 01:03:02,606
And then just like getting a large amount of those over time

1241
01:03:02,646 --> 01:03:04,788
instead of like building out entire full games from them.

1242
01:03:05,539 --> 01:03:07,900
So I think we're going to be all more kind of art centric,

1243
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:11,041
but I will tell you some things that I've seen that have worked in the past that

1244
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:11,962
aren't just playable.

1245
01:03:12,582 --> 01:03:16,684
The most important way to judge game design is to interact with it, right?

1246
01:03:16,724 --> 01:03:20,805
So that's going to be your primary use case for selling somebody that you are

1247
01:03:20,845 --> 01:03:23,106
talented. But I have seen something interesting,

1248
01:03:23,146 --> 01:03:29,889
which is kind of a long form conversation about your thought process as a deep

1249
01:03:29,929 --> 01:03:33,270
dive on an aspect of what you're designing. So for instance,

1250
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,911
I've seen people go on and say like, Hey,

1251
01:03:35,391 --> 01:03:37,031
Look what happens when I jump, okay?

1252
01:03:37,051 --> 01:03:38,772
Look what happens when I jump and hold.

1253
01:03:39,052 --> 01:03:40,192
Look what happens when I add a little bit

1254
01:03:40,212 --> 01:03:41,572
of a camera shake bump to that jump.

1255
01:03:41,852 --> 01:03:43,173
Look what happens when I hit the ground

1256
01:03:43,213 --> 01:03:44,413
and then I dip the camera a little bit

1257
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:45,773
and then I have an easing function

1258
01:03:45,793 --> 01:03:47,234
that pulls it right back at the right speed

1259
01:03:47,254 --> 01:03:48,914
so that I feel like I should be able to jump again

1260
01:03:49,314 --> 01:03:49,874
right at the right moment.

1261
01:03:50,134 --> 01:03:53,655
So all these really subtle things go into that problem

1262
01:03:54,035 --> 01:03:56,836
and seeing somebody take it all the way down the rabbit hole

1263
01:03:56,876 --> 01:03:58,756
in this kind of long form blog style,

1264
01:03:58,796 --> 01:04:00,777
like here's what I did and here's my thought process,

1265
01:04:01,157 --> 01:04:03,117
is one of the only ways I think for people

1266
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:04,898
to get inside of a designer's head.

1267
01:04:06,298 --> 01:04:09,721
So, I don't think any of us are capable of telling you exactly,

1268
01:04:09,781 --> 01:04:11,742
here's how you make a good design portfolio really,

1269
01:04:12,322 --> 01:04:15,564
but I have seen that work or at least whet the appetite

1270
01:04:15,584 --> 01:04:18,026
of designers looking at other designers' work.

1271
01:04:18,887 --> 01:04:19,667
So, for what it's worth.

1272
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:25,154
Would something like making tutorials just sort of show off that I know what I'm doing,

1273
01:04:25,374 --> 01:04:26,255
that'd be a good way to get...

1274
01:04:26,275 --> 01:04:27,676
I think that's an interesting way to do it too.

1275
01:04:27,876 --> 01:04:31,239
I mean, you don't really know something until you can teach it to somebody else.

1276
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:34,623
So if you can prove that you can teach it to somebody else, that's probably a pretty good thing.

1277
01:04:34,983 --> 01:04:36,004
Okay, cool. Thank you.

1278
01:04:37,758 --> 01:04:43,560
Hi there. So in times in your portfolio when you want to include that you've been a team lead

1279
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,981
and you're handling other people's assets and things like that,

1280
01:04:47,061 --> 01:04:52,443
how would you show that off in the portfolio in kind of an interesting way rather than like a line of text?

1281
01:04:57,585 --> 01:04:58,926
It's a chin scratcher.

1282
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,347
So is your work mixed in?

1283
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:11,856
Yeah, I'm a student right now, so I have many experiences, one of them being kind of the producer or a team lead in a game, we were creating the game.

1284
01:05:13,699 --> 01:05:15,141
And you're creating assets as well?

1285
01:05:15,935 --> 01:05:16,236
Oh yes.

1286
01:05:16,776 --> 01:05:17,036
Okay.

1287
01:05:17,296 --> 01:05:17,796
So I would, I mean,

1288
01:05:17,816 --> 01:05:22,699
I was also like, um, taking other people's assets and putting them together for one polished.

1289
01:05:23,179 --> 01:05:23,940
That could be text.

1290
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:26,961
Again, you could start with a, a, a, a beauty shot.

1291
01:05:27,662 --> 01:05:32,905
And then what I would do is probably isolate your assets in the shot and then knock back the rest of it.

1292
01:05:33,065 --> 01:05:36,046
And then in the text, just a little text blurb.

1293
01:05:36,306 --> 01:05:38,648
I mean, I guess that's probably how I would just do it off the top of my head.

1294
01:05:39,828 --> 01:05:41,209
Um, you know, point out.

1295
01:05:41,759 --> 01:05:43,379
These are mine, the ones that, and then you could just,

1296
01:05:43,919 --> 01:05:47,280
you know, do a, do a, just a breakdown of those pieces

1297
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:47,860
by themselves.

1298
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,301
And just remembering that that data point,

1299
01:05:50,341 --> 01:05:53,041
that thing that you did is just icing again.

1300
01:05:53,061 --> 01:05:56,242
That's not really that meaningful to like somebody

1301
01:05:56,302 --> 01:05:57,462
judging your work.

1302
01:05:57,502 --> 01:05:59,442
Your work still has to be the thing that speaks for itself.

1303
01:05:59,942 --> 01:06:01,202
A tiny little data point that says,

1304
01:06:01,362 --> 01:06:03,003
oh, and I helped everybody else too,

1305
01:06:03,323 --> 01:06:04,823
would be, might be that little kicker

1306
01:06:05,163 --> 01:06:07,384
that makes you a tiny touch more interesting,

1307
01:06:07,424 --> 01:06:09,204
maybe than the next person that didn't do that.

1308
01:06:09,284 --> 01:06:10,264
All other things being equal.

1309
01:06:10,704 --> 01:06:15,530
but I wouldn't overvalue that in exchange for other things.

1310
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:19,415
I would make sure that the art is still the forefront of the thing that you're trying to get across.

1311
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:22,699
Thank you.

1312
01:06:25,032 --> 01:06:28,053
Hello guys, thanks for the presentation, it was awesome.

1313
01:06:29,294 --> 01:06:35,957
I'm a character artist and before I once showed someone my work and they said that if you're

1314
01:06:35,977 --> 01:06:38,458
interested in being a character artist, just show the character.

1315
01:06:39,538 --> 01:06:44,120
But sometimes when I finish the character, I'm excited, I pose it out, I get to put them

1316
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:46,101
in an environment and get a nice still.

1317
01:06:48,782 --> 01:06:55,087
You know, just to kind of show a little bit more soul, like you guys were saying, stand out from the crowd so you don't get your typical A-pose, T-pose.

1318
01:06:56,549 --> 01:06:58,811
Could you guys elaborate on what you guys would rather see?

1319
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:04,573
I actively don't love seeing T-Pose characters.

1320
01:07:04,633 --> 01:07:07,295
Like I find it much more interesting to understand.

1321
01:07:07,316 --> 01:07:10,158
I mean, we've talked about context a lot today.

1322
01:07:10,178 --> 01:07:12,640
This idea of this is this character

1323
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:14,522
as they fit into an environment.

1324
01:07:14,582 --> 01:07:16,824
Obviously don't put them in a random environment

1325
01:07:16,904 --> 01:07:18,885
that feels like a disconnect.

1326
01:07:19,566 --> 01:07:21,567
If you can pose them in interesting ways,

1327
01:07:21,628 --> 01:07:23,869
if you can show them interacting with other characters.

1328
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:27,633
if you can prove out that this is a model that moves well and rigs well

1329
01:07:28,274 --> 01:07:31,297
and can exist in an environment, I personally think that's a boon.

1330
01:07:31,898 --> 01:07:35,922
Especially with concept art as well, when I just see a character just

1331
01:07:35,962 --> 01:07:38,125
standing there, it's like, well, that's useless. Show me them

1332
01:07:38,145 --> 01:07:43,150
emoting, show me them moving, show me how they work within an environment and not

1333
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:43,470
just

1334
01:07:44,011 --> 01:07:44,451
on their own.

1335
01:07:45,069 --> 01:07:47,570
Yeah, I think it comes down to presentation, right?

1336
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:51,231
So if you're putting a character in an environment

1337
01:07:51,751 --> 01:07:52,931
and the environment's distracting

1338
01:07:52,951 --> 01:07:54,151
from the quality of the character,

1339
01:07:54,331 --> 01:07:55,652
then it's a bad idea, right?

1340
01:07:56,552 --> 01:07:58,532
If you're not good at rigging or posing

1341
01:07:58,952 --> 01:08:00,433
and it's distracting from the quality of the character,

1342
01:08:00,453 --> 01:08:03,353
it's bad, but there is a happy medium

1343
01:08:03,373 --> 01:08:05,334
where you can go from the A pose

1344
01:08:05,354 --> 01:08:06,514
to something that's more relaxed

1345
01:08:06,534 --> 01:08:08,234
that fits the character and looks more natural,

1346
01:08:08,474 --> 01:08:10,355
and that still shows that you went the extra mile

1347
01:08:10,395 --> 01:08:13,636
to care about how people view your work as an experience,

1348
01:08:14,076 --> 01:08:14,316
you know?

1349
01:08:15,336 --> 01:08:17,739
I think that's what matters more than like,

1350
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,982
it's in an environment.

1351
01:08:20,282 --> 01:08:21,443
I mean, I'm worrying about that,

1352
01:08:21,463 --> 01:08:22,825
and especially too, if you're trying to,

1353
01:08:23,305 --> 01:08:24,206
if you're trying to get in,

1354
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:26,889
and you're spending time building out an environment

1355
01:08:27,029 --> 01:08:29,312
when things on your character could be better,

1356
01:08:29,732 --> 01:08:31,895
then you need to invest the time in the character,

1357
01:08:31,915 --> 01:08:33,516
not in the other parts, you know?

1358
01:08:33,937 --> 01:08:35,298
Okay, all right, thank you.

1359
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:37,040
Hi.

1360
01:08:37,532 --> 01:08:38,792
Hello, guys, thanks for the talk.

1361
01:08:40,453 --> 01:08:42,955
I am a 3D environment artist, but I'm also

1362
01:08:42,975 --> 01:08:45,957
thinking of switching lanes into narrative design.

1363
01:08:46,397 --> 01:08:50,040
Although my issue is I only have 3D environment

1364
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:54,823
art in my portfolio and nothing related to narrative design.

1365
01:08:54,843 --> 01:08:57,044
So I was wondering what exactly you

1366
01:08:57,064 --> 01:08:59,246
would put in a narrative design portfolio

1367
01:08:59,686 --> 01:09:03,068
and how exactly would you outline or format that?

1368
01:09:03,088 --> 01:09:04,829
Does it have to be images, or does it

1369
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,090
have to be Word documents?

1370
01:09:07,225 --> 01:09:11,068
I mean, a lot of people use, like, what's that old game that's, like, 20 years old now

1371
01:09:11,108 --> 01:09:12,148
that people are still making?

1372
01:09:12,689 --> 01:09:13,689
Neverwinter Nights or whatever?

1373
01:09:13,709 --> 01:09:18,072
I think Moby said it was Half-Life 2 and maybe had an existential crisis up here.

1374
01:09:19,593 --> 01:09:24,396
But, like, they're actually basically scripting narrative experiences in these, directly in

1375
01:09:24,416 --> 01:09:29,619
these games, and, you know, those games expose an SDK that allows you to do that.

1376
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,821
The reality is you're kind of screwed.

1377
01:09:32,637 --> 01:09:33,738
You don't have anything right now.

1378
01:09:34,138 --> 01:09:34,298
Right.

1379
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:36,380
Then don't trick yourself into thinking you have anything.

1380
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:37,061
Because you don't.

1381
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:39,023
If you want to be a narrative designer

1382
01:09:39,063 --> 01:09:41,245
and you are not reflecting that work,

1383
01:09:41,726 --> 01:09:44,108
then you've got to start over, basically.

1384
01:09:44,729 --> 01:09:46,250
So you're doing yourself a disservice

1385
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:49,573
if you think you can torque and twist this environment work

1386
01:09:49,593 --> 01:09:51,836
that you've done in the past to serve that purpose.

1387
01:09:52,196 --> 01:09:54,879
You're going to put yourself immediately in a very awkward.

1388
01:09:55,519 --> 01:09:57,641
middle place where nobody's happy.

1389
01:09:57,941 --> 01:09:59,683
The people who are reviewing the portfolio aren't happy,

1390
01:09:59,743 --> 01:10:01,304
and then you're not happy because you feel like

1391
01:10:01,344 --> 01:10:02,906
you're not even representing your own work

1392
01:10:03,426 --> 01:10:05,248
that is the thing you want them to hire you for.

1393
01:10:05,268 --> 01:10:08,311
I think you're just gonna have to put in the time, honestly.

1394
01:10:08,951 --> 01:10:11,413
And that probably involves something playable

1395
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:13,295
where you can actually show and interact

1396
01:10:13,335 --> 01:10:14,676
with these narratives that you're interested

1397
01:10:14,716 --> 01:10:16,698
and passionate about, these stories you're trying to tell.

1398
01:10:16,718 --> 01:10:19,521
You're gonna have to kind of do that in situ, so to speak,

1399
01:10:19,621 --> 01:10:20,942
so that people can interact with it.

1400
01:10:21,582 --> 01:10:26,205
And you can even prove a lot with like using ink or something where you're just writing these interactive

1401
01:10:26,525 --> 01:10:31,128
just totally text narratives like the entire beginning of firewatch is just

1402
01:10:31,508 --> 01:10:37,532
Really emotional thing that made me cry when I first played through it and all it is is you're just making simple decisions and being

1403
01:10:37,572 --> 01:10:40,213
Walked through this story and interacting with a story

1404
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:43,034
And so what I think you need to do, yeah, is just you need to write.

1405
01:10:43,234 --> 01:10:46,035
You need to write in ways that are interactive.

1406
01:10:46,255 --> 01:10:50,555
If you can find small jams that are happening, where you can add your work

1407
01:10:50,875 --> 01:10:54,496
to these small projects and really prove out how to design a narrative.

1408
01:10:55,296 --> 01:10:58,697
It's that same thing where you can't just slowly transition that portfolio.

1409
01:10:58,737 --> 01:11:03,198
That's just gonna be a separate portfolio that you slowly fill out until you feel

1410
01:11:03,238 --> 01:11:06,138
like you have a body of work to show to people.

1411
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:11,852
Okay, because currently there is a story idea that I'm working on, but I'm guessing since

1412
01:11:11,912 --> 01:11:15,735
at this point should I just focus more on the environments of that and then put that

1413
01:11:15,775 --> 01:11:20,438
into the portfolio or just like drop that whole idea?

1414
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:24,240
I mean, it's really a question about like what you want, you know?

1415
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:28,123
If like you really want to be a narrative designer then rebuild.

1416
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:29,404
Yeah, just got to work at it.

1417
01:11:29,424 --> 01:11:29,604
Yeah.

1418
01:11:29,864 --> 01:11:30,745
Okay, thank you.

1419
01:11:31,645 --> 01:11:31,985
Go ahead.

1420
01:11:32,746 --> 01:11:33,086
I'm a...

1421
01:11:34,943 --> 01:11:42,766
I'm a game and level design student, and most of my portfolio work contains a complete level

1422
01:11:42,786 --> 01:11:44,527
that I made from a school project.

1423
01:11:46,607 --> 01:11:51,849
For a level design portfolio, should there be things like bubble diagrams and 2D layouts,

1424
01:11:52,589 --> 01:12:00,752
maybe videos of prototypes, and of course either a playable version of the level and the video?

1425
01:12:01,337 --> 01:12:02,698
That goes without saying, I think.

1426
01:12:02,758 --> 01:12:06,679
But the bubble diagrams and map layouts and all those,

1427
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:09,479
should I add those as well or just show the finished product?

1428
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,180
I would definitely show your process.

1429
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,861
And I mean, yeah, just what you're saying right there

1430
01:12:14,881 --> 01:12:19,742
sounds pretty good to me, especially for level design.

1431
01:12:19,762 --> 01:12:22,583
You guys have anything to say?

1432
01:12:23,763 --> 01:12:24,403
Yeah, show your work.

1433
01:12:24,663 --> 01:12:25,483
I think that's valuable.

1434
01:12:25,691 --> 01:12:26,591
Yeah, absolutely.

1435
01:12:26,951 --> 01:12:29,632
And I think it shows that you didn't just accidentally fall

1436
01:12:29,692 --> 01:12:31,093
into good level design.

1437
01:12:31,493 --> 01:12:33,774
If you're showing that entire diagrammatic process

1438
01:12:33,874 --> 01:12:36,255
and showing the thought behind it, it's really valuable.

1439
01:12:37,095 --> 01:12:39,936
So guys, we're going to wrap it up right now

1440
01:12:40,377 --> 01:12:43,458
and start lining up for the portfolio reviews.

1441
01:12:43,918 --> 01:12:46,979
But to the two people that are still left and the sides,

1442
01:12:46,999 --> 01:12:48,920
if you guys could just come up forward to us

1443
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:49,880
and talk to us directly.

1444
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:49,940
OK.

1445
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:50,580
Cool.

1446
01:12:50,941 --> 01:12:51,081
Cool.

1447
01:12:51,581 --> 01:12:52,141
Thanks a lot.

1448
01:12:52,161 --> 01:12:52,661
Thank you.

1449
01:12:52,681 --> 01:12:53,081
Thanks, everybody.

1450
01:12:53,101 --> 01:12:53,642
Thanks, guys.
