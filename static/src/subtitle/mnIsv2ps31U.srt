00:00:04,307 --> 00:00:10,328
Hello everybody. My name is Tommy Palm and the title of my talk is Game Accelerators for the

2
00:00:10,448 --> 00:00:18,830
Arts, not for Monetization. I had a person I didn't know come up to me yesterday and ask me

3
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:28,552
if it was an ironic title, which I assure you it's not. He had a different picture of who I was

4
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:30,372
publicly and what I would talk about.

5
00:00:32,096 --> 00:00:37,602
I heard you could get into this session with an expo pass, so I considered to have like

6
00:00:37,642 --> 00:00:44,649
a freemium model for this talk to help out the poor organizers with their cash, but I

7
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:51,175
decided against it. So, I'm going to read this slide as a wall of text.

8
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:58,054
Between 1962 and 1984 Andy Warhol had a studio in New York

9
00:00:58,154 --> 00:00:58,835
called The Factory.

10
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:02,376
There he invited other artists, musicians, writers, filmmakers

11
00:01:02,476 --> 00:01:05,497
to spend time working on their projects side by side.

12
00:01:05,557 --> 00:01:08,238
People like Bob Dylan, Truman Capote, Mick Jagger.

13
00:01:09,218 --> 00:01:12,699
This was the same idea Oscar Bierman had in mind when he

14
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,520
sat with Tommy Palm.

15
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:17,037
One day in his office in Stockholm, bringing 20 game

16
00:01:17,057 --> 00:01:20,317
developers together to spend a summer in the cabin in the

17
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:21,418
woods of Sweden.

18
00:01:21,818 --> 00:01:25,599
This was written by Louis Wong in an article in Kill Screen

19
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:25,999
Magazine.

20
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,080
And this presentation is about a non-profit accelerator that

21
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,441
I've been involved in in my spare time.

22
00:01:33,681 --> 00:01:35,282
And it's been one of the most rewarding

23
00:01:36,382 --> 00:01:37,602
experience of my career.

24
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:44,378
I've divided this up in three parts, and I'll tell you about the start up of this process first.

25
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:49,763
The pictures are from the Stuganeers themselves, for most parts.

26
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:51,605
We have a few of them here.

27
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,126
Have a seat down.

28
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:59,717
Two years when this came about, I had already had quite a long

29
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:01,338
career in game development.

30
00:02:01,378 --> 00:02:04,961
And I've been lucky enough to go to several fantastic events.

31
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:10,025
This picture is from Oulu in northern Finland, where I spent

32
00:02:10,386 --> 00:02:13,848
four days workshopping with very talented game developers

33
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:16,811
in a formal mental institution.

34
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:19,953
And I met some of my now best friends there.

35
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,123
I had some thoughts that this would be something really cool to do more often with getting

36
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:30,324
talented people together.

37
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:36,867
I met Oskar and he showed me a PowerPoint on his idea of a summer camp for game developers

38
00:02:37,007 --> 00:02:43,091
and I jumped on that and I said that's way too fun to not do.

39
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:49,954
So we started working on it on weekends and evenings and we got Jana on board who worked

40
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:51,915
full time on the project as well.

41
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:58,121
We commissioned a graphic designer to make this picture

42
00:02:58,161 --> 00:03:00,782
very early on. This was kind of the thing we had in mind, a

43
00:03:03,623 --> 00:03:08,345
cabin out in the Swedish nature where you would work together

44
00:03:08,385 --> 00:03:13,527
with your friends. And this was very helpful for us throughout

45
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:14,227
the project.

46
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:25,938
One of the other things that came up very early, I always felt that it's very important to have a good name for the things that you're working on, even if it's a game engine or it's a company.

47
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,031
or an idea that you're working on.

48
00:03:28,071 --> 00:03:30,132
And we came together and discussed,

49
00:03:30,152 --> 00:03:32,713
and we felt that one thing that we wanted to have

50
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,774
is this Swedish-sounding name that

51
00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:37,315
would sound very exotic to others,

52
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:40,557
make it easier for its uniqueness.

53
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:44,659
Some ice cream manufacturers have adopted the same thing

54
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,000
without it actually being a Swedish word.

55
00:03:49,098 --> 00:03:54,564
I thought about that, I was studying at the Royal Institute of Technology once upon a time,

56
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:59,610
and my teacher there made the first commercial video game in Sweden in 1978.

57
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:05,470
And I went there, back to him, and I explained about the

58
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,531
project and asked if we could borrow that name.

59
00:04:08,592 --> 00:04:13,575
And he asked his friends that was also helping him out doing

60
00:04:13,595 --> 00:04:16,277
this fantastic text-based adventure game.

61
00:04:17,058 --> 00:04:18,219
And they loved the idea.

62
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,960
And we could use that name, Stogan, as a throwback to that

63
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,361
old game.

64
00:04:24,783 --> 00:04:24,923
So.

65
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:32,095
The financial aspects of this is a core part of the presentation and we felt that traditional

66
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:37,646
accelerators normally work a little bit like investors, that they take a part of the company

67
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,008
that people

68
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:42,340
apply and come together as a team.

69
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,501
But there were several different problems with that.

70
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:48,522
One of the things was that most of the game developers that we

71
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:51,323
knew that was really talented in these didn't have a company.

72
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:54,104
And we wanted them to be able to come from the whole world,

73
00:04:54,184 --> 00:04:55,645
not only Sweden, obviously.

74
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:59,586
And we know nothing about corporate laws outside Sweden.

75
00:04:59,746 --> 00:05:02,007
And not very much about Swedish corporate laws either, to be

76
00:05:02,027 --> 00:05:03,367
honest.

77
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:06,468
So we wanted to get rid of that shackle.

78
00:05:07,694 --> 00:05:09,775
Another thing was the commitment.

79
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,516
This was a new project and we knew that the indie game

80
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:16,497
developers didn't necessarily know very much about us and

81
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:18,838
would be hesitant to give away something they might have been

82
00:05:18,878 --> 00:05:20,138
working on for a really long time.

83
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:27,140
So it would be much easier if we didn't have that thing where

84
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,661
we needed to have this long-term commitment.

85
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,102
Also, if you're an incubator or an accelerator, you need to

86
00:05:34,182 --> 00:05:35,303
focus a lot on the economy.

87
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:38,204
And even though we believe that that's an important part

88
00:05:38,524 --> 00:05:42,686
of making games, it's not that much fun.

89
00:05:43,126 --> 00:05:46,528
I'd rather not focus on that part.

90
00:05:46,548 --> 00:05:49,990
There are a lot of other interesting talks about

91
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,790
monetization and stuff.

92
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:58,996
But it's not what we wanted. We felt that it would be really fantastic to really focus on the things that we truly enjoyed.

93
00:05:59,016 --> 00:06:03,879
The joy of game development and inspiration of creating great ideas.

94
00:06:05,584 --> 00:06:10,248
We also felt that it's very hard to predict what is a hit

95
00:06:10,648 --> 00:06:11,769
and what is not a hit.

96
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:15,932
And to have this much looser form where we would just

97
00:06:16,052 --> 00:06:20,476
select some really cool people and projects would make it

98
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:24,058
easier for us not to be reliant on that financial aspect.

99
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:27,925
So we had to come up with another way of financing this.

100
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:32,509
And Sweden has been fortunate of having some successes,

101
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:36,433
and some people made money out of that.

102
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:41,317
So we gathered some of our successful friends

103
00:06:41,578 --> 00:06:44,380
in a fundraiser in Stockholm in November 2014.

104
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,182
And fundraiser is something that is unheard of in Sweden.

105
00:06:50,222 --> 00:06:51,802
We've only seen it in American movies.

106
00:06:52,342 --> 00:06:56,044
So we kind of did our best version of it.

107
00:06:56,344 --> 00:06:57,864
And we told them about this project.

108
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,845
It was still very loose.

109
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:04,287
And people were really psyched about it and just helping out.

110
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:07,868
So we got a majority of the money from just private

111
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:11,189
sponsors from very successful games companies.

112
00:07:15,473 --> 00:07:18,774
Another part of it is that we didn't have really a budget for

113
00:07:18,834 --> 00:07:23,455
any marketing, so instead we tried to utilize our personal

114
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:26,976
brand and the company brands and the game brands to create

115
00:07:27,036 --> 00:07:28,336
buzz about this project.

116
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:31,697
So we would reach out and developers would hear so they

117
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:32,198
could apply.

118
00:07:32,978 --> 00:07:37,699
And we spent a little bit of money on PR efforts.

119
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:41,340
And we have a very talented PR guru that I've been working

120
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:41,520
with.

121
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:47,308
It's Paul, and he helped us to create a fantastic amount of

122
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:51,012
interest for the project, which was vital for people

123
00:07:51,293 --> 00:07:53,655
finding out and being able to apply in time.

124
00:07:57,217 --> 00:08:00,800
One of the bigger challenges that we didn't really realize,

125
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,523
we felt that it would be great if people could follow the concept from all around the world.

126
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:10,586
And in our naive thoughts, we thought, let's get a YouTuber and be embedded there,

127
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:14,468
and they would love that, and they get a lot of attention and have materials to write about.

128
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,252
But it turned out that it wasn't at all that easy.

129
00:08:18,632 --> 00:08:22,374
Our network is very strong in the game development community.

130
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:26,757
And we asked the YouTubers that we knew about,

131
00:08:26,777 --> 00:08:29,879
the ones that were already successful,

132
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,680
felt that they didn't want to live in a forest

133
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:35,442
and that would be hampering their work.

134
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:37,824
And we didn't get a lot of interest for this.

135
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:39,745
So this started to become a problem.

136
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:42,326
And one month before, we still hadn't a solution.

137
00:08:43,287 --> 00:08:49,151
Really. Until fortunately I was interviewed by this British video game reporter named

138
00:08:49,211 --> 00:08:54,375
Alicia Judge, and she had read about Stoogan and she asked a lot about really interesting

139
00:08:54,575 --> 00:09:00,219
questions and she seemed genuinely psyched about the project. So we asked her if she

140
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:05,643
wanted to join Stoogan and be an embedded reporter there for the entire stay and she

141
00:09:05,683 --> 00:09:10,667
said yes. So that was fantastic. And she helped out with the project.

142
00:09:11,668 --> 00:09:15,190
filming and doing the scripts and even some of the editing.

143
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:19,514
So it was possible to follow Stugan from the sidelines.

144
00:09:23,577 --> 00:09:27,741
We tried to have a rather simple application process

145
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:32,064
where people would just record a 90-second video of themselves

146
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:33,906
and their game concept.

147
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:35,628
and send it to us.

148
00:09:36,048 --> 00:09:41,211
This is me, Oskar and Jana, working through those videos

149
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:44,292
and short description of their game and trying to select

150
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:45,272
which team we wanted.

151
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:49,814
We wanted a very diverse group of people from different

152
00:09:49,854 --> 00:09:51,355
backgrounds and different parts of the world.

153
00:09:52,595 --> 00:09:55,857
We felt that would be a very good source of inspiration and

154
00:09:56,197 --> 00:09:58,078
interest from media and stuff.

155
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,280
This brings me to the second part, which is year one.

156
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:09,353
The night before it started, I think nobody could really sleep.

157
00:10:09,953 --> 00:10:15,096
Bringing 23 strangers into an isolated cabin in the woods,

158
00:10:16,477 --> 00:10:21,419
it's, you know, you can imagine anything could happen.

159
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:27,042
But it turned out to be absolutely fine, of course.

160
00:10:27,222 --> 00:10:31,725
The 21st of July, all the people met.

161
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:42,937
there and from different parts of the world. And they stayed for eight weeks living together and

162
00:10:43,778 --> 00:10:52,525
eating their food there. They're working. So here is an overview video of the location that we

163
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:59,210
got in the end. It's way much bigger than we had originally imagined that we would need, but it

164
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,171
turned out that this was a...

165
00:11:03,023 --> 00:11:07,467
perfect size for the 23 people. So they had a separate room to

166
00:11:07,747 --> 00:11:12,190
sleep in and a separate house to work in and another place to

167
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:18,796
eat. So it was really great. And it's by a lake and rather

168
00:11:20,277 --> 00:11:22,579
isolated three hours outside Stockholm.

169
00:11:26,363 --> 00:11:30,144
When it comes to the actual budget, we spent about 150K

170
00:11:31,785 --> 00:11:37,667
dollars on the project. We got the majority of the money from

171
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:42,068
individual sponsors. We got some money from the region itself

172
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:46,330
that wanted to have this project there. And some money from the

173
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,771
Swedish Innovation Fund sponsored by the government.

174
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:54,893
That's Vinnova with a third of the cash.

175
00:11:56,607 --> 00:12:01,894
We also, very importantly, got to borrow that entire location from the Swedish traffic

176
00:12:03,295 --> 00:12:08,682
organization, which was a huge help for the budget. That's not actually in the budget. So we

177
00:12:08,702 --> 00:12:14,348
spent more money on food instead than we would normally because they had just one caterer that

178
00:12:14,388 --> 00:12:15,570
we could use for food.

179
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:25,766
We discussed a lot on how the teams would keep their motivation going out into a sunny

180
00:12:25,806 --> 00:12:31,311
place for the entire summer, but it turned out that the team were able to themselves

181
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:38,177
get very inspired by the pure chance of getting to work on their project undisturbed.

182
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:45,742
There was no regular office hours, but every time I was there, people were working late into the

183
00:12:45,802 --> 00:12:55,406
night and were very focused on their task. Mentors came up three times a week to meet with the

184
00:12:55,446 --> 00:13:01,629
teams one-on-one. And there was a really great interest for, we had more mentors actually

185
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:03,990
wanting to come up than we could accommodate.

186
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,102
And in the end, we had a presentation of all the

187
00:13:09,142 --> 00:13:12,445
concepts and games at the Technical Museum in Stockholm,

188
00:13:13,706 --> 00:13:15,208
where there was a lot of interest from the press.

189
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:19,451
We had articles from Wall Street Journal and a lot of

190
00:13:19,611 --> 00:13:21,032
big publications.

191
00:13:21,273 --> 00:13:23,455
Even Playboy wrote a piece on this.

192
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:26,897
We had participants at different levels, which was a

193
00:13:27,178 --> 00:13:27,558
great thing.

194
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,480
So some of the teams were really experienced and had done

195
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,380
it many times before.

196
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:33,883
Other teams, this was their first game that they worked on.

197
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:38,569
Here are some of the mentors that came up.

198
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,750
We had Jens Bergensten from Mojang,

199
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,571
he's one of the lead developers and designers on Minecraft.

200
00:13:46,472 --> 00:13:50,653
We have people from International that flew over.

201
00:13:50,673 --> 00:13:53,735
Paul Bregel is an angel investor.

202
00:13:55,238 --> 00:14:03,164
Paul Brady, our PR guru, helped the team with strategies on getting press and getting their

203
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:04,486
stories about the game out there.

204
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:10,871
Something that we felt is a core part of discovery for your indie games, to work professionally

205
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,712
with that.

206
00:14:12,772 --> 00:14:21,179
Steven Gerrard from King was one of the more popular mentors who spoke to the teams about

207
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,960
their creative process.

208
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,156
We also got Vigo, the professor who made the original Stoogan

209
00:14:28,176 --> 00:14:28,797
game when he was 12.

210
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,201
He came up and talked about math and algorithms and stuff.

211
00:14:32,341 --> 00:14:32,782
That was great.

212
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:36,306
So the third part of this.

213
00:14:38,897 --> 00:14:44,119
It's the second part of Stoogan that we are doing this year.

214
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,141
So we've raised another round of financing to clear the

215
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:52,003
second year, and we have opened the application process.

216
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:56,425
And the first game that came out of Stoogan released

217
00:14:57,145 --> 00:15:02,888
earlier, and I want to show you the application that Clint

218
00:15:03,188 --> 00:15:04,768
sent in to us when he applied.

219
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:06,369
And this is Clint's first.

220
00:15:08,547 --> 00:15:12,509
First game, he made a few tutorial games in Unity before this.

221
00:15:12,609 --> 00:15:16,631
He used to work as a visual artist in Hollywood before.

222
00:15:17,611 --> 00:15:18,252
Oh, sorry.

223
00:15:20,713 --> 00:15:24,915
Hi Stugan, my name is Clint Sue, and this is Prism.

224
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:29,718
Prism is a puzzle game for iPad about atomic matter.

225
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:33,260
By solving patterns and symbols on each prism,

226
00:15:34,681 --> 00:15:36,321
the structure starts to unfold.

227
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:43,621
And you begin to discover the secrets that connect the entire universe.

228
00:15:50,746 --> 00:15:51,367
Short and sweet.

229
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:59,154
This is one of the typical projects that I find extremely inspiring.

230
00:15:59,194 --> 00:16:07,560
We have a single individual doing all the programming, game design, just scoping the

231
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,066
project and he's also done the sound effects and music behind it.

232
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:16,995
So it's really like a one-man game factory.

233
00:16:17,035 --> 00:16:21,040
It released it for iOS, and it became one of the top 20 most

234
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,903
downloaded paid apps pretty quickly.

235
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:25,164
You can see it in the expo floor.

236
00:16:25,204 --> 00:16:31,151
It's a huge made by Unity promotion for the game as well.

237
00:16:32,632 --> 00:16:36,316
And Clint is working on taking it to other

238
00:16:36,336 --> 00:16:36,997
platforms as well.

239
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:42,432
As I said, we opened a new application process.

240
00:16:42,532 --> 00:16:48,519
It goes throughout the end, to the end of this month.

241
00:16:49,721 --> 00:16:56,369
Just to summarize, some of the big challenges that we faced was finding the location.

242
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,542
We thought that it would be very easy.

243
00:16:59,582 --> 00:17:03,687
Like, Sweden is a sparsely populated country, and it has

244
00:17:03,707 --> 00:17:08,533
a lot of great old houses in the middle of nowhere.

245
00:17:09,174 --> 00:17:12,117
And a lot of these are connected with really strong

246
00:17:12,137 --> 00:17:12,778
fiber internet.

247
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:19,082
But we were spending a lot of time searching for something that would fit us.

248
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:22,804
There was always something that didn't really fit the puzzle.

249
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:25,065
So we're very happy we found it eventually.

250
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:30,409
The YouTuber that I mentioned turned out to be much more difficult than we could possibly imagine.

251
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:36,977
And getting people to apply was something that was sincerely nerve-wracking.

252
00:17:37,017 --> 00:17:42,240
We had an application process last year and when there was still two weeks left, there

253
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,062
was very, very few applicants.

254
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:48,905
And we had already made a big bus about this in press and we were getting very nervous

255
00:17:48,945 --> 00:17:51,327
that we wouldn't be able to fill the 20 spaces.

256
00:17:53,308 --> 00:17:57,293
As we saw, a lot of them came in at the very end of the application process.

257
00:17:57,313 --> 00:18:04,122
But we actually got advice to prolong it a little bit and say that we would help with

258
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:05,984
feedback if people applied early.

259
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,988
So it made our self-confidence a little better.

260
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:14,461
Turned out to be a little bit tricky to get the mentors and

261
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:16,883
journalists out there in the middle of nowhere.

262
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,746
The Swedish people who live nearby, that was easier.

263
00:18:21,786 --> 00:18:25,068
But flying people into Stockholm, which is rather far

264
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:29,511
in itself, and then taking a train out three hours is

265
00:18:30,471 --> 00:18:32,653
challenging, but can be done.

266
00:18:33,193 --> 00:18:36,295
And for the mentors that came there, they were extremely

267
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,276
inspired by the teams.

268
00:18:39,338 --> 00:18:42,259
super excited about coming out again next year.

269
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:50,161
So, in my final notes here, I just wanted to say something.

270
00:18:50,201 --> 00:18:52,222
I saw this great article in VentureBeat

271
00:18:53,242 --> 00:18:55,343
about the Hottest Startup Ecosystem.

272
00:18:55,363 --> 00:18:57,124
Silicon Valley was listed as the number one,

273
00:18:57,564 --> 00:18:59,605
and Stockholm was listed as number two, actually.

274
00:19:00,145 --> 00:19:02,485
And they explained how they put this together

275
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:03,506
and said that the biggest...

276
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:08,834
The contributing thing was the pay it forward culture mentality.

277
00:19:08,974 --> 00:19:14,884
They used a young Steve Jobs that was mentored by Intel's CEO as a great example.

278
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:19,856
I really like this with game development in general.

279
00:19:19,876 --> 00:19:23,578
There's a big community of helping each other out and not

280
00:19:23,638 --> 00:19:25,720
seeing each other as competitors very much.

281
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,984
And I definitely think that it's good for both consumers

282
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,706
and developers in the end that we get better games.

283
00:19:36,282 --> 00:19:39,586
So that's all for this presentation.

284
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:43,311
If you're interested in the project, you can see links

285
00:19:43,371 --> 00:19:47,976
here, and there's also Jana is the project manager for

286
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:51,901
Stugan, is here today as well.

287
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:53,683
So you can talk to her if you want.

288
00:19:53,783 --> 00:19:55,886
I'll happily answer questions.

289
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:56,606
Thank you very much.

290
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:17,396
Hi. My main question is, how do you evaluate artistic success if it's an incubator for artistic creation?

291
00:20:19,977 --> 00:20:26,760
That's a good question. We do not really evaluate it, I would say. We are very much focused on those eight weeks.

292
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:33,082
We're super happy to see if the game comes out, and that's definitely an aspiration that we have.

293
00:20:33,122 --> 00:20:33,923
Thank you.

294
00:20:36,172 --> 00:20:41,449
select projects that we think are scoped so they can come out.

295
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:46,948
But other than that, this differs very much from other

296
00:20:47,008 --> 00:20:52,112
incubators in that way that we don't necessarily need to see

297
00:20:52,152 --> 00:20:54,914
a commercial success in order to be happy.

298
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:59,677
When we have a selected project, we've been trying to

299
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:04,180
be a little bit edgy and looked at taking things that

300
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:08,904
feels very innovative and different from maybe what

301
00:21:08,944 --> 00:21:12,246
traditional incubators or publishers would accept.

302
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:13,687
Thank you.

303
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,270
Thank you.

304
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:18,413
Am I allowed to do this?

305
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:18,894
Hi.

306
00:21:18,914 --> 00:21:19,514
Hi.

307
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:20,235
I have a question.

308
00:21:21,275 --> 00:21:23,277
I was part of a program like this, very similar, last year.

309
00:21:23,777 --> 00:21:27,641
And you were saying that it was,

310
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,703
what was it called, the fundraiser culture.

311
00:21:31,243 --> 00:21:32,625
Fundraisers don't really happen over there.

312
00:21:34,186 --> 00:21:36,408
And it seemed, I mean, obviously it was very successful.

313
00:21:37,468 --> 00:21:40,471
I'm wondering about that, like how did he get that to work?

314
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:41,612
And also just kind of how does this,

315
00:21:42,512 --> 00:21:44,472
pay it forward, culture work.

316
00:21:44,492 --> 00:21:46,253
All these people are probably not

317
00:21:46,313 --> 00:21:48,034
known for giving tons of money away

318
00:21:48,354 --> 00:21:49,934
without anything coming back.

319
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:53,476
Is there convincing that has to be done?

320
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:55,957
I mean, I don't want to say what's in it for them,

321
00:21:56,537 --> 00:21:58,038
but yeah, what's in it for them?

322
00:21:59,158 --> 00:22:01,779
Is it like press or just because they've?

323
00:22:02,242 --> 00:22:04,303
Well, I think it was different from different people.

324
00:22:04,343 --> 00:22:10,225
I definitely think that some are motivated by the chance of getting seen as a sponsor.

325
00:22:10,666 --> 00:22:19,550
But many of them felt that they've been successful in games, and that has been very inspiring

326
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:19,850
for them.

327
00:22:21,499 --> 00:22:22,620
So it's one of those things.

328
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,422
We had a lengthy discussion on the last fundraiser,

329
00:22:25,683 --> 00:22:27,704
like what are the goals?

330
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:29,185
Why should we do this?

331
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:30,186
And why are we doing it?

332
00:22:30,386 --> 00:22:34,730
And I think it varies very much from person to person.

333
00:22:36,812 --> 00:22:41,375
For me personally, I just like the idea very much.

334
00:22:41,395 --> 00:22:46,580
I think it's a lot of fun to do something

335
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,182
that is very different and doesn't necessarily

336
00:22:49,222 --> 00:22:49,642
need to be.

337
00:22:51,681 --> 00:22:57,988
focused on financing and packaging and all these other

338
00:22:58,028 --> 00:23:00,171
things that comes into commercial game projects.

339
00:23:01,372 --> 00:23:01,633
Thank you.

340
00:23:03,555 --> 00:23:03,815
All right.

341
