00:00:08,854 --> 00:00:14,138
Hello everyone, my name is Tori Schaefer and I will be talking to you about my experience

2
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,841
representing LGBT plus characters in games.

3
00:00:17,982 --> 00:00:21,544
So first of all, let's talk about who I am.

4
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:28,790
I am a writer and narrative designer. I currently work for Spellbreak, a PvP fantasy game which is currently in beta.

5
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:34,895
In the past, I worked for Elder Scrolls Online, an MMO RPG set in the Elder Scrolls universe,

6
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:41,261
and a game called Backbone, which was an indie noir detective narrative set in a dystopian future.

7
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:48,485
I also wrote for the quest, Manor of Mass for Elder Scrolls Online, which included a

8
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:53,888
character named Alchemy, who was Elder Scrolls' first openly transgender woman, and that quest

9
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:57,310
ended up winning a GLAAD award for Outstanding Video Game in 2019.

10
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:05,256
GLAAD is the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation and works to create respect to help

11
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:11,562
endorse respectful representation of the LGBT plus community in media. And this is my content

12
00:01:11,582 --> 00:01:18,908
information. You can see my website, my Twitter, and my email. Feel free to contact me if you have

13
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:22,411
any further questions or comments about this presentation.

14
00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:29,672
So, how can we ensure respectful LGBT representation in games?

15
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:36,016
So, we're going to talk about what is LGBT representation, what does good representation

16
00:01:36,056 --> 00:01:42,040
look like. I'll use examples of my own work to show how I respectfully represented the

17
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:47,904
LGBT community, and I'll give you some tips and tricks to help you create LGBT representation

18
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:49,125
in your own games.

19
00:01:51,258 --> 00:01:54,419
So first of all, what is LGBT plus representation?

20
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:58,560
So it's characters in medias who have a minority sexuality

21
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,580
and or gender.

22
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,621
So lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,

23
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:07,442
but also asexual, demisexual, non-binary characters.

24
00:02:08,263 --> 00:02:11,303
Any character who is not straight and or cisgendered.

25
00:02:12,464 --> 00:02:15,085
It has a very troubled history, obviously.

26
00:02:15,105 --> 00:02:17,185
I think that's something that's well known.

27
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,686
There's been a lack of representation in media.

28
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:28,711
There's been stereotypes, harmful tropes, and because of this kind of lack of representation

29
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:33,211
and negative representation, the LGBT plus community can be very sensitive to how they

30
00:02:33,251 --> 00:02:38,012
are represented, which is why we need to work as game developers and anybody who creates

31
00:02:38,072 --> 00:02:42,533
media to make sure that their representation that we are putting out there is respectful

32
00:02:42,573 --> 00:02:48,554
to the community, more so than, you know, people who are not LGBT plus, characters who

33
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:49,554
are not LGBT plus.

34
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:56,726
And we need to ensure that we are understanding and cognizant of those issues

35
00:02:57,327 --> 00:03:00,308
and of that history when we are creating these characters.

36
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:02,870
So, you know.

37
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:08,153
What does respectful LGBT plus representation look like?

38
00:03:09,513 --> 00:03:12,815
Going to be giving you some pillars of good representation

39
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:15,396
that would also apply to other marginalized groups,

40
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:20,319
if that's something that, you know, you're interested in as well.

41
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:35,744
So, realistic. Is this portrayal accurate? It's a portrayal that avoids stereotypes and

42
00:03:35,784 --> 00:03:40,566
makes sure that the character isn't defined by their sexuality or gender.

43
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:47,091
And this is helped by research, making sure that game developers who are working on this content

44
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:52,452
are as diverse as possible, and also consuming community-approved LGBT plus media,

45
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:56,913
things that have had a positive response from the LGBT plus community,

46
00:03:57,773 --> 00:04:02,454
and making sure that you understand kind of the types of identities that you're representing.

47
00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:10,055
Is this considerate? Is the narrative considerate of past and current LGBT plus issues?

48
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:17,187
making sure that characters are not inherently bad because of their sexuality or gender.

49
00:04:17,627 --> 00:04:20,709
The narrative should not punish a character because of their identity,

50
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:27,232
even if the society that character is a part of does. It's very two different, very different

51
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:32,915
things. How you represent that person, how you present them in the game can really define if

52
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:34,376
something is considered or not.

53
00:04:35,197 --> 00:04:38,780
And obviously, once again, mindful of the LGBT plus community

54
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,462
in the past representation, making sure that your narrative

55
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:43,243
is sympathetic to these characters.

56
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:47,086
So question, how is the narrative treating this character?

57
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,248
What's the message the narrative is giving to the player

58
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:51,929
about this character and their identity?

59
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,291
Being mindful of all that.

60
00:04:56,433 --> 00:05:00,296
Explicit, our characters explicitly stated to be LGBT plus.

61
00:05:02,976 --> 00:05:08,121
Do they openly say like, you know, their identity or openly talk about their identities experiences?

62
00:05:09,422 --> 00:05:15,208
But you have to be mindful of doing this without the characters consent having other characters reveal

63
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:21,516
a character's identity can be, you know, it's just something that you want to avoid both in

64
00:05:21,776 --> 00:05:26,658
games and real life, making sure that you have the consent of that individual, that their identity

65
00:05:26,758 --> 00:05:32,021
can be openly talked about or shown. And just the best way to do that is to make sure the

66
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,963
character is the one telling the player who they are and what their identity is.

67
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,601
Respectful. Is the character's identity respected by the narrative?

68
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:49,724
Making sure that that LGBT identity is never the butt of a joke. You can have these characters be funny.

69
00:05:49,904 --> 00:05:52,404
You can have these characters make jokes,

70
00:05:53,565 --> 00:05:55,705
but not in a stereotypical,

71
00:05:55,886 --> 00:05:56,666
harmful way.

72
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:05,091
you have to be respectful of the LGBT plus community and kind of their experiences and making sure that you're not relying on you know,

73
00:06:05,471 --> 00:06:06,832
those harmful things

74
00:06:07,752 --> 00:06:12,194
and being respectful to the community as well on social media, making sure that

75
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:17,396
on social media your studio, your developers are not making harmful, you know,

76
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,718
jokes or comments about the LGBT plus community

77
00:06:20,738 --> 00:06:24,020
and just being mindful of how that community,

78
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,800
the LGBT plus community,

79
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:33,342
reacts to your characters and interprets your characters in your stories. If somebody has a head canon that a character

80
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:37,884
identifies a certain way or two characters have a certain kind of relationship,

81
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:42,625
making sure that you respect that because that is how that

82
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:47,006
player is deciding to consume your content so that they are represented.

83
00:06:47,806 --> 00:06:53,390
Making sure that you never feel like they're wrong for doing so or that they're lesser for doing so I suppose so just being

84
00:06:53,810 --> 00:07:00,634
Cognizant of your community and how they consume media and how you treat them on social media and events and things like that

85
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:08,200
So I'll be talking about my first example is Elder Scrolls Online. I'll be talking about two examples here.

86
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:12,143
So my first example is a quest in the

87
00:07:13,263 --> 00:07:15,965
Elder Scrolls Online Summerset expansion or chapter

88
00:07:17,126 --> 00:07:22,789
which is an MMORPG set in the Elder Scrolls universe, a high fantasy setting that explores various themes.

89
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:30,214
From the very get-go in Elder Scrolls Online, it was decided that LGBT plus characters were a part of that universe

90
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:32,556
And they were just accepted by their society

91
00:07:33,737 --> 00:07:34,277
as to not

92
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,800
alienate LGBT plus players who may be playing Elder Scrolls Online

93
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:44,725
And also just because we wanted representation to be you know able to put in the game very easily

94
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:47,506
I think and a lot of characters to identify as that without

95
00:07:48,207 --> 00:07:50,068
worrying about societal repercussions

96
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:55,452
So there's a variety of LGBT plus characters in Elder Scrolls Online,

97
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:58,915
but mostly it's gay representation, lesbian, bisexual characters,

98
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:02,077
things of that nature, which is why I was really excited

99
00:08:02,157 --> 00:08:05,879
when I got the opportunity to work on the quest involving the character

100
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:09,842
Alchemy, who is the first openly transgender woman in Elder Scrolls.

101
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:17,453
She is respected by her society, she's respected by the narrative, as I'll get into a little bit.

102
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:22,654
And she's in the quest Manor of Masks for Elder Scrolls Online Summerset, as I've said.

103
00:08:23,614 --> 00:08:31,476
She does have some predecessors who are non-binary, the god Vivec, the Daedric Princess,

104
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:36,417
but we wanted to make sure that her character reflected a transgender woman's experience,

105
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:38,777
and that was how she openly identified as.

106
00:08:40,362 --> 00:08:45,724
So, the manner of Mass Quest, this is just a short description, but Renaid, who is shown

107
00:08:45,784 --> 00:08:50,046
on screen right here, Renaid has asked me to find her brother Liridel and stop him from

108
00:08:50,066 --> 00:08:51,407
joining the House of Reveries.

109
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:54,969
I must audition as well in order to figure out who he is.

110
00:08:55,629 --> 00:08:56,269
So this is a...

111
00:08:57,671 --> 00:09:03,054
high elf. She's a high elf who is looking for her brother. And she says, Oh, no, my brother's trying

112
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:08,077
to join an acting troupe. And I want him to be a mage like I am. You have to figure out who he is,

113
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:12,920
because everybody in this acting troupe wears masks on their face. So she says, you should

114
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:17,823
audition as well. See who my brother is find out whoever there is so I can talk him out of this

115
00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:24,827
nonsense. And surprise, surprise. Laredel now identifies as alchemy and is a woman.

116
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:31,474
And that's how you kind of learn through the quest narrative that alchemy is transgender because you're introduced

117
00:09:32,494 --> 00:09:33,554
to this character as

118
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:35,275
Mernide's brother, Laredel.

119
00:09:35,935 --> 00:09:41,917
And then you learn about this character, Alchemy, and eventually it's revealed that she used to identify as Laredel and she used to identify

120
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:45,258
as a man and she now identifies as Alchemy in a woman.

121
00:09:46,684 --> 00:09:51,967
So, just kind of going through this quest and kind of seeing if it's, if it's respectful,

122
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:59,092
you know, is this realistic? Is this a realistic representation of a transgender woman?

123
00:10:01,564 --> 00:10:06,168
So first we made sure that Alchemy was a fully fleshed out character with her own hopes and dreams.

124
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,972
She does feel that she must keep her identity a secret from her sister,

125
00:10:11,573 --> 00:10:16,617
but hopes for her sister's acceptance. Now this is because she's an actress when her sister wants her

126
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:21,982
to be a mage, but yes it is supposed to reflect the fact that she is a transgender woman.

127
00:10:23,043 --> 00:10:26,146
That she wants her sister's acceptance as that identity as well

128
00:10:27,087 --> 00:10:33,433
She felt uncomfortable in her old identity identity and now feels happy with her new one and more ways than just her gender

129
00:10:33,453 --> 00:10:34,254
you know, she was

130
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:37,578
Also very unhappy as a major scholar

131
00:10:38,115 --> 00:10:41,216
But we know we wanted that to reflect her kind of change over to

132
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:44,797
um her new identity as a woman as alchemy

133
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,619
Uh, and she's connected to and supported by other transgender characters off screen

134
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:54,240
She talks about those experiences and how those people have helped her kind of um, you know

135
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,461
Embrace and really love her new identity

136
00:10:58,161 --> 00:11:03,023
But we never show those characters in the class just because of time constraints and character constraints and things like that

137
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:06,224
Is this considerate

138
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:11,086
So we made sure that alchemy was an ally to the hero and accepted by her sister

139
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:15,529
We wanted to keep it very positive for this kind of first for way for a

140
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:19,532
This first time representing a transgender woman in elder scrolls

141
00:11:20,232 --> 00:11:22,033
You know online in elder scrolls period

142
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:27,817
We make sure that the player never reveals alchemy's identity without her explicit consent

143
00:11:28,217 --> 00:11:32,480
The player does advise alchemy if she wants to talk to her sister or not, but the player never

144
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:36,524
says her identity or tells other people about her identity.

145
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:38,166
It's all alchemy doing that.

146
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:43,231
And Somerset, her society, you know, her homeland of the high elves, Somerset,

147
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:47,336
accepts her identity and doesn't really care that she's transgender,

148
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:51,820
which is, again, going with that overall theme of LGBT plus characters

149
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,304
being accepted by the society or their societies and elder scrolls.

150
00:11:57,622 --> 00:12:04,666
Um, is this explicit? Alchemy openly admits that she is transgender. She talks about her past identity and her current identity.

151
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:11,349
She discusses other transgender high elves in Summerset that she's met and she talks about their experiences as well in um,

152
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,250
dialogue after the quest.

153
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:21,055
And she speculates that there are many such individuals all over Tamriel. Um, this was something we wanted to write into the quest because

154
00:12:22,612 --> 00:12:27,475
we wanted to make sure that players who are transgender, whatever race they decide to play, if they were an orc,

155
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:33,279
or a nord, or a dark elf, that yeah, you exist too in the world. It's just not high elves,

156
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,381
you know, it's everybody. Every race has kind of this,

157
00:12:37,102 --> 00:12:37,822
these individuals.

158
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:42,986
And she talks about that, and we just wanted to make sure that players felt comfortable role-playing

159
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:46,508
as their own characters, you know, as a transgender identity.

160
00:12:46,528 --> 00:12:47,649
So.

161
00:12:50,785 --> 00:12:51,887
Is this respectful?

162
00:12:53,088 --> 00:12:58,793
Alchemy's identity is never spoken in a joking or harmful or mean-spirited way

163
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:02,597
You know, she's referred to as a woman as she is

164
00:13:03,378 --> 00:13:03,518
um

165
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:07,822
the player never is able to make harmful comments because we didn't want to like

166
00:13:08,523 --> 00:13:13,425
Upset LGBT plus players who may be playing as that character for that option to even exist

167
00:13:13,445 --> 00:13:15,545
Just make sure it's very respectful all the way through

168
00:13:16,426 --> 00:13:23,188
She's featured a number of marketing materials for Somerset, but she was also included in our International Woman's Day post last year

169
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:28,010
Which a lot of players were really really happy about that

170
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:33,872
We included her in this community picture just a small little token meant so much to so many people

171
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:43,121
again, making sure that social media is also respectful and representing LGBT plus community

172
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:44,722
is very important in games as well.

173
00:13:48,923 --> 00:13:53,585
Nothing's perfect. We did have representation concerns. I think you're always going to have

174
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:57,326
concerns about the content you produce in the media and the representation you produce,

175
00:13:58,507 --> 00:13:59,387
you know, in any media.

176
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:07,692
Stereotypes. Yeah, it's a stereotype that LGBT plus people are actors.

177
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:08,272
That's truth.

178
00:14:09,153 --> 00:14:12,016
It's that I don't think it's particularly harmful stereotype,

179
00:14:12,536 --> 00:14:16,700
but it is something that a lot of media does or talks about and things like that.

180
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,163
And now it's just something that we decided that she fit in.

181
00:14:20,183 --> 00:14:22,625
Well, this was we created the

182
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:28,404
the acting troupe and the lore of the acting troupe before we introduced Alchemy,

183
00:14:28,884 --> 00:14:31,207
so this was just something that we felt she fit in too well,

184
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,852
but we had to be cognizant that this was a stereotype.

185
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:38,359
Her appearance alchemy wears a mask

186
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:45,345
Everybody in the manor of masks or sorry everybody in the house of reveries, which is her acting troop wears a mask

187
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:47,807
They talk about it all the time. They talk about why they do that

188
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:54,372
But you know, we have a trans character who is wearing a mask and is never really shown her face again

189
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:56,914
This was part of the lore before we introduced alchemy

190
00:14:57,394 --> 00:15:01,658
But we were cognizant that that may have been something that was you know

191
00:15:01,898 --> 00:15:04,420
something that we wouldn't have wanted to do but

192
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,064
it did fit into the lore in the game.

193
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:12,995
You know, and that's just something that we had to kind of be cognizant of.

194
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:18,424
But unfortunately, you know, we did have a character whose face was was covered.

195
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,716
The resolution, the ending resolution is very quickly handled.

196
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:29,199
We wanted to show that Renai accepted alchemy and loved her still

197
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,581
and just have a very positive experience.

198
00:15:32,021 --> 00:15:35,223
But yeah, it happens very quickly because that's kind of the quest

199
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:38,145
is only so long and the narrative is only so long.

200
00:15:39,026 --> 00:15:43,210
So we wanted to make sure that the resolution kind of came together in a very positive way

201
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:45,913
We're aware, you know of these issues

202
00:15:46,754 --> 00:15:46,894
um

203
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:53,781
But you know, sometimes the gameplay just kind of you can't have perfect representation the way that you really want it to be

204
00:15:53,801 --> 00:16:01,229
Uh, and she's the one and only uh the point of this quest alchemy was the only transgender woman in the game

205
00:16:02,152 --> 00:16:08,339
Which creates much higher stakes is less realistic portrayals of the many facets of transgender people the more representation you have

206
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:15,067
The more rounded your representation is because you can show different sides of that identity different facets of it. Um

207
00:16:15,968 --> 00:16:21,554
But yeah, definitely, you know wanting to include alchemy in this content and then build on her representation, which i'll talk about

208
00:16:22,035 --> 00:16:22,696
in just a little bit

209
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:29,127
So as you can see, fan reaction was super positive, super great.

210
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:33,509
I was really happy with how the community accepted this quest and just loved this quest.

211
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:36,551
You can see these comments that I'm including here.

212
00:16:37,091 --> 00:16:38,492
Just like super excited.

213
00:16:38,932 --> 00:16:42,854
I've had fans come up to me and be like, oh at the end of the quest when they hug I cried

214
00:16:42,874 --> 00:16:44,294
because it meant so much to me.

215
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:48,496
So just, you know, it's a quest that means a lot to me, a character that means a lot

216
00:16:48,516 --> 00:16:49,557
to me because of how...

217
00:16:50,338 --> 00:16:54,141
Much it means to other people which is what representation is really all about

218
00:16:55,062 --> 00:17:02,449
Representing these the LGBT plus community is for the LGBT plus community first and foremost that they feel respectfully represented

219
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:05,932
And they're and they're gonna be excited and happy to be represented

220
00:17:05,952 --> 00:17:13,159
Here's some fan art just wanted to include this I really like these uh, these pieces and how they came out

221
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:21,112
Alchemy and then we won a GLAAD award in 2019, which I was I'm super honored that we were able to win this

222
00:17:21,372 --> 00:17:24,254
Um, and they just kind of really caught on that the story

223
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:30,239
Reflects the reality of transgender people today, even though it doesn't explicitly talk about

224
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:33,001
Like, you know, we're not doesn't you know

225
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:40,126
We're not accepts her sister for who she is, you know accepts alchemy, but you know, we we use that kind of

226
00:17:41,522 --> 00:17:47,938
narrative about being a mage and a scholar to kind of show that without explicitly showing that I suppose you could say

227
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:51,147
So yeah, and then building on representation.

228
00:17:52,248 --> 00:17:55,371
I Merck Meyer was a DLC came right after this.

229
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:58,954
It's about our guardians, the lizard people and Elder Scrolls,

230
00:17:59,214 --> 00:18:02,117
and their Lord just has that they can change gender,

231
00:18:02,597 --> 00:18:05,179
that they are able to do that with the help of their tree gods.

232
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,343
And in that society, they are going into really all about change,

233
00:18:09,363 --> 00:18:10,224
accepting change.

234
00:18:10,284 --> 00:18:11,825
So I was able to create.

235
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:19,608
Well, I concepted and wrote for a quest, a small quest where there was a transgender man and a transgender woman character.

236
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:32,232
And then I also wrote a book called The Grand Transformation, just talking about how society celebrates this and celebrates when Argonians, when one of their members of their tribe changes their gender.

237
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:41,052
So, the next example I'm going to talk about is a character in Backbone. Now Backbone is a noir

238
00:18:41,172 --> 00:18:47,396
narrative game about a raccoon detective living in dystopian Vancouver. It has very heavy themes

239
00:18:47,456 --> 00:18:54,441
of racism, misogyny, and yes, homophobia. It's a society that is heavily homophobic,

240
00:18:55,002 --> 00:19:00,446
and most of the LGBT community, the LGBT plus community is heavily closeted for their own

241
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:04,068
protection. And those who aren't are rejected, you know, they might.

242
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:07,191
be sent to jail, rehabilitation camps.

243
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:10,874
It's heavily influenced by homophobia in America and Russia.

244
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:14,797
And, you know, this created a new challenge for me.

245
00:19:14,917 --> 00:19:19,861
How do I create respect representation in a very disrespectful game world

246
00:19:19,921 --> 00:19:22,483
with a very disrespectful and homophobic society?

247
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:27,767
So, you know, thinking about that, I concepted and created the character Sofia.

248
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,290
So Sofia, who is not pictured here.

249
00:19:32,266 --> 00:19:37,689
These are two main characters, but when I concepted this character and created, she did not have any art associated with her

250
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:42,532
So i'll just be talking about her today and kind of how I created her character and how I I?

251
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:49,036
Concepted her to be a respectful presentation, even though she herself is disrespected by her society

252
00:19:50,157 --> 00:19:57,322
Uh, so sofia is a lesbian npc who has been rejected by her society and her family and forced into homelessness

253
00:19:58,723 --> 00:19:58,803
um

254
00:19:59,609 --> 00:20:03,313
So, just thinking about my four pillars, is this realistic?

255
00:20:03,433 --> 00:20:04,354
Unfortunately, yes.

256
00:20:05,035 --> 00:20:09,640
Sophia has a developed personality and opinions, we made sure that she was a fully fleshed out character,

257
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:19,191
but her lack of status as a homeless individual allows her to speak openly about her sexuality to the player character.

258
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:26,371
And unfortunately, homelessness is just a common issue within LGBT community, especially youth,

259
00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:32,097
especially teenagers or young adults because of being rejected by their families.

260
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,506
Sophia does reflect this. So yeah, trying to make her as realistic and fleshed out as possible.

261
00:20:42,081 --> 00:20:43,041
Is this considerate?

262
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:49,103
I made sure that Cynthia was a sympathetic character and a victim of her society,

263
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:53,584
not of the narrative that her society was the one who rejected her and didn't accept her.

264
00:20:54,764 --> 00:20:59,525
And I wanted to allow a member of the LGBT plus community to speak about society's discrimination

265
00:20:59,565 --> 00:21:04,646
against them. I didn't want you know, I didn't want to make sure that I'm sorry, I didn't want

266
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:10,087
her mother to talk about her experiences or her friend or somebody else, but for Sophia to be able

267
00:21:10,107 --> 00:21:11,648
to talk about her experiences herself.

268
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:14,730
to give a voice to that community.

269
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:18,212
Is this explicit?

270
00:21:19,053 --> 00:21:23,095
I mean, Sophia does openly state that she was in a relationship with another woman.

271
00:21:23,756 --> 00:21:26,057
And she shares that story with a brutal honesty

272
00:21:27,118 --> 00:21:28,199
to the player character,

273
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,501
wanting to make sure that the player understood what

274
00:21:32,242 --> 00:21:35,864
her identity was and how society did not accept that.

275
00:21:39,023 --> 00:21:44,271
Is this respectful? Um, the player character does not make any assumptions about Sophia or judge her

276
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:48,897
Maybe the person playing the game does but we did not want the player character to do so

277
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:54,825
You know the play creature just ask questions allow Sophie to give her own thoughts in her own opinion

278
00:21:56,527 --> 00:22:00,429
And we also researched and tried to avoid lesbian tropes in media,

279
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:04,732
such as like a lipstick lesbian, dead lesbian syndrome, these are common tropes.

280
00:22:05,672 --> 00:22:09,295
Trying to avoid those to make her not a stereotypical character.

281
00:22:09,755 --> 00:22:11,356
Or a stereotyped character, I should say.

282
00:22:14,237 --> 00:22:16,078
Of course, we had concerns, you know.

283
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,881
She has a tragic backstory.

284
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:23,523
Her backstory in her current life, very dispiriting.

285
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:30,347
But this is a result of her society, not so much that the narrative, you know, is punishing her for her identity,

286
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:32,671
but that her society has punished her for her identity.

287
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:39,803
She's a mouthpiece. She's acts as a voice for her entire community

288
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:47,270
And as we know different perspectives lead to more rounded narratives. This was just unfortunately because of limited characters limited time

289
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:51,674
It's a short game and you know, this was kind of a character that I was a little concept out

290
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:57,519
Who was able to talk about her experiences because of her position in society, you know

291
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:00,941
if she was just walking down the street or if she was you know, I

292
00:23:01,402 --> 00:23:04,647
in a crowded bar, she wouldn't talk about these experiences, but because of

293
00:23:05,108 --> 00:23:07,792
you know, where she was at the time and what her

294
00:23:08,293 --> 00:23:12,038
status was, she was able to tell the player character, like, yeah, this is what happened to me

295
00:23:12,098 --> 00:23:13,140
and this is who I am.

296
00:23:15,525 --> 00:23:18,768
One and only she's the only openly NPC we meet

297
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:22,991
again short narrative closeted society

298
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,673
We wanted to make sure that we had this representation

299
00:23:25,874 --> 00:23:31,898
But it would you know, it's always nice to have more of a presentation and a more rounded LGBT plus, you know

300
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:37,983
representation to show your audience and your players and to talk about and to having your story

301
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:43,528
So yeah, so just two very different experiences for me

302
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:47,990
and experiences to write about and to research and to give,

303
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:51,591
but always making sure that no matter how the game world

304
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:53,691
sees the character, that I as a creator

305
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,232
and the narrative that I help create

306
00:23:56,692 --> 00:23:58,133
is respectful to those characters.

307
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:00,053
And that's all about those four pillars.

308
00:24:00,937 --> 00:24:05,800
you know, being respectful, being considerate, being realistic, being explicit.

309
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,942
You can do those things and make sure that those are elements

310
00:24:08,962 --> 00:24:13,104
that your narrative has, no matter how your story kind of sees this character

311
00:24:13,624 --> 00:24:16,626
or your your society of that world sees the character.

312
00:24:17,886 --> 00:24:22,489
So just some tips. How can we ensure that our games have respectful LGBT representation?

313
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:25,370
Research, research, research.

314
00:24:26,251 --> 00:24:29,733
Making sure that you understand these identities, you understand their history,

315
00:24:29,773 --> 00:24:32,895
you understand kind of where these characters are coming from.

316
00:24:33,435 --> 00:24:37,837
Hiring for diversity, and making sure that your studio welcomes that diversity.

317
00:24:37,897 --> 00:24:42,780
If you have LGBT plus people in your studio or in your creative team,

318
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,841
they are able to give a much more...

319
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:48,884
like a better insight into that community and to that representation.

320
00:24:50,085 --> 00:24:53,707
Studio initiatives to create that diverse representation being,

321
00:24:53,727 --> 00:24:57,329
you know, leads need to be the ones to say, hey, guys, let's make sure

322
00:24:57,369 --> 00:25:02,793
that we're creating a diverse cast, a diverse story and supporting designers

323
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:06,095
who want to create that representation, giving them the time to research,

324
00:25:06,515 --> 00:25:09,957
giving them the resources needed, making sure that you're positive

325
00:25:10,018 --> 00:25:13,620
about that initiative of creating those characters can go a long way.

326
00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:18,570
As I said, your social media presence needs to be LGBT plus positive as well,

327
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:26,012
making sure that you are not saying anything rude or degrading and keeping that LGBT plus positive

328
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:31,073
representation going throughout all of your studio initiatives, marketing, things like that.

329
00:25:31,973 --> 00:25:37,395
And consulting the experts. I talked, you know, about diversity readers, but

330
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:48,485
And there are a lot of individuals who you can hire on as a diversity reader to play your game and to play through the narrative to give you, you know, notes about the representation that you are presenting.

331
00:25:49,286 --> 00:25:51,867
Another group you can talk to is GLAAD.

332
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:54,168
They are a media group.

333
00:25:54,568 --> 00:26:00,111
They are there for consultation and to give you advice about your game.

334
00:26:01,132 --> 00:26:04,754
Gamer X, the group that talks about a lot of game like.

335
00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:08,793
gamer perspectives, but they are another resource that you can reach out to.

336
00:26:09,554 --> 00:26:13,699
This website, Queerly Represent Me, has great examples of video game representation,

337
00:26:13,719 --> 00:26:19,106
a lot of information that you can read through, just another resource that I found very helpful

338
00:26:19,186 --> 00:26:20,688
in my own research.

339
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:30,896
Yeah, so just the takeaways I want to kind of say here is that LGBT plus characters and narratives deserve a place in games

340
00:26:30,916 --> 00:26:32,457
They deserve to be represented

341
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:36,559
And representation does not need to be perfect to be respectful

342
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:36,939
You know

343
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:43,242
you're gonna have hitches within your gameplay within your narratives and you're just going to have to try to use as

344
00:26:43,382 --> 00:26:49,966
Much, you know as much of those pillars as you can to ensure that even though there might be you know, some

345
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:56,368
Issues that overall you are giving a respectful, you know

346
00:26:56,889 --> 00:26:59,850
Story for this character to be to be a part of a respectful role

347
00:27:01,711 --> 00:27:05,053
And fans will respond positively to respectful representation

348
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:09,635
I know it can be scary because when you get it wrong, the LGBT plus community is very upset

349
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:11,056
But you've got to you know

350
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:16,199
Know that when you really try to put yourself out there and create that diverse representation you will get

351
00:27:16,777 --> 00:27:23,119
a lot of, you know, excitement and tears, honestly. And it's just very important for

352
00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:27,601
the community to be represented and to be shown in media and video games is included in that.

353
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:34,403
Great. So let's work together to ensure that every game has respectful LGBT plus representation.

354
00:27:36,427 --> 00:27:40,830
Like I said, you can contact me if you have any more questions or comments.

355
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:45,494
I have my website up here, my Twitter, my email.

356
00:27:45,634 --> 00:27:46,515

357
00:27:47,316 --> 00:27:48,557
I'll answer as best I can.

358
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:54,602
And thank you so much for sitting through this presentation and hearing what I had to

359
00:27:54,662 --> 00:27:54,862
say.

360
00:27:56,283 --> 00:27:58,865

361
