1
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,451
First of all, I'd like to remind you

2
00:00:07,651 --> 00:00:10,432
to turn your cell phones into silent mode.

3
00:00:11,632 --> 00:00:16,053
And by the way, this is my second talk here at GDC,

4
00:00:17,054 --> 00:00:20,115
and it is completely the same as the first one,

5
00:00:20,155 --> 00:00:22,195
so you may have probably heard this one.

6
00:00:24,436 --> 00:00:25,996
Okay, now let's start.

7
00:00:28,009 --> 00:00:34,298
My name is Vladimir. I am from Russian game development studio Picsonic and

8
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:36,400
I have about seven years of

9
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:41,567
mobile experience and games for social networks and

10
00:00:41,587 --> 00:00:43,009
I'd like to share with you

11
00:00:44,757 --> 00:00:48,698
my experience of answering specific questions at Pixonic.

12
00:00:49,778 --> 00:00:52,239
And actually, I think that these questions

13
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:54,019
bother every game studio,

14
00:00:54,519 --> 00:00:56,100
no matter what games you're working on,

15
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,640
what platform or what genre.

16
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:00,321
Still, you have to answer them,

17
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:02,442
and they are as follows.

18
00:01:02,682 --> 00:01:04,862
Okay, we've got some revenue flow now.

19
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:07,823
How exactly are we going to keep it?

20
00:01:08,263 --> 00:01:09,884
Or how are we going to increase it?

21
00:01:10,044 --> 00:01:10,824
What should we do next?

22
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,345
How to grow, to make your game grow?

23
00:01:16,183 --> 00:01:20,507
So, I understand that answering these questions could,

24
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:23,390
the answers to these questions could vary greatly

25
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,752
depending on your field of expertise,

26
00:01:26,473 --> 00:01:28,855
on the market background, history of the company,

27
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:31,878
and all that stuff, and this is just my version.

28
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:36,722
First of all, let me tell you a bit about our context.

29
00:01:36,822 --> 00:01:37,683
Where are we here?

30
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:47,104
We are situated in Moscow and we've been making games since 2009 and War Robots is our biggest

31
00:01:47,184 --> 00:01:48,104
hit so far.

32
00:01:48,665 --> 00:01:55,048
It is a mobile shooter PvP game where players pilot giant robots fighting each other with

33
00:01:55,228 --> 00:02:00,650
various weapons like missiles, lasers, cannons, machine guns, all that stuff.

34
00:02:02,237 --> 00:02:04,938
And the game was released in 2014.

35
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:07,620
It is pretty popular right now.

36
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,362
By the way, this slide is outdated a bit.

37
00:02:11,862 --> 00:02:14,544
Now we have more than 120 million installs

38
00:02:14,564 --> 00:02:15,344
on all the platforms.

39
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:18,946
And about 1.5 million of players pilot robots

40
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:19,947
in our game every day.

41
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:24,730
Why the game became popular in the beginning?

42
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,271
Why it became successful?

43
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:30,592
I think that at the time when it was released,

44
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:32,993
there were very few mobile shooters on the market

45
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:36,395
and players actually wanted to play mobile shooters.

46
00:02:38,932 --> 00:02:40,232
they had little choice.

47
00:02:40,892 --> 00:02:43,473
The game wasn't very good at the time.

48
00:02:43,493 --> 00:02:46,494
There were a lot of flaws and the metrics weren't good,

49
00:02:46,894 --> 00:02:50,915
but still, we had our community growing.

50
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:54,596
We had our Facebook groups growing.

51
00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:58,357
The word of mouth about the game, it was spreading.

52
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:03,218
And we had to answer these questions,

53
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:04,338
I said it in the beginning,

54
00:03:05,178 --> 00:03:07,759
that how exactly are we going to grow?

55
00:03:09,307 --> 00:03:10,948
We are mobile and we are free to play.

56
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:13,489
And we are game developers, right?

57
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:15,790
So we wanted to add new features to the game.

58
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,390
But what features exactly?

59
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:20,332
And for the sake of my argument here,

60
00:03:21,632 --> 00:03:24,593
I'll talk about two models, two approaches.

61
00:03:24,853 --> 00:03:26,494
There could be different classifications

62
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:30,475
or there are a lot of ways to classify features.

63
00:03:30,595 --> 00:03:30,796
But...

64
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:34,815
I like to talk about the hype model, as I call it,

65
00:03:35,575 --> 00:03:38,697
and it is characterized by a high spike of revenue

66
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:40,337
in the beginning when it is released,

67
00:03:41,198 --> 00:03:42,838
and a quick drop down afterwards.

68
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:47,100
Usually, most of the content in the game released

69
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,541
behaves like this.

70
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:52,802
The second model, it is what I call value growth model,

71
00:03:53,562 --> 00:03:57,824
and it is all about sacrificing short-term gain

72
00:03:57,964 --> 00:03:59,545
for long-term profit.

73
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:06,306
It could be difficult to understand if this feature is successful from the beginning

74
00:04:06,326 --> 00:04:08,609
because you don't have a high revenue spike from the start,

75
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,176
but it will definitely bring you money afterwards.

76
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:18,769
Basically value growth model, it is a bit trickier

77
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:20,370
to design this kind of features

78
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,891
because it is about designing needs

79
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,412
that are impossible to fulfill in the game.

80
00:04:26,652 --> 00:04:28,032
They should be continuous.

81
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:31,433
And it is like the very basic human needs

82
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:35,434
like the need for food, for sleep, for sex, all that stuff.

83
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:40,536
So, hype model I think it is a bit easier to design

84
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:43,757
and to analyze if it is successful or not after the release.

85
00:04:46,123 --> 00:04:47,944
which one of these models is better.

86
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:50,425
I don't know, frankly.

87
00:04:51,585 --> 00:04:56,448
And there are advantages and disadvantages

88
00:04:56,608 --> 00:04:57,628
of both approaches.

89
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:01,490
But first of all, what you should understand

90
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,452
that it should correspond with your goals.

91
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:09,794
If exactly you want to get returns fast,

92
00:05:10,254 --> 00:05:12,676
in this case, you probably should use the hype model.

93
00:05:13,885 --> 00:05:17,626
as a methodology for the designing of your feature.

94
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:20,308
And if you're going to,

95
00:05:21,348 --> 00:05:23,469
if you're ready to wait to get more money,

96
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:26,290
in this case, value growth is much better for you.

97
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:30,792
Basically, it is like a marshmallow test

98
00:05:31,952 --> 00:05:34,674
offered to kids when you have just one marshmallow

99
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:35,314
and you can eat it,

100
00:05:36,114 --> 00:05:38,275
or you can wait to get the second marshmallow.

101
00:05:39,576 --> 00:05:42,977
And in 2015, when we thought about it,

102
00:05:43,597 --> 00:05:45,557
we actually failed that test.

103
00:05:46,018 --> 00:05:48,418
We ate our marshmallow and we wanted to grow quickly

104
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:50,759
because we needed money for user acquisition.

105
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:53,839
We wanted our marketing budget to grow quickly.

106
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,401
Now let's try to compare the examples of features

107
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,921
for each kind of model.

108
00:06:02,501 --> 00:06:04,102
And the example of the hype model

109
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:07,162
which was made in War Robots is Gacha.

110
00:06:10,059 --> 00:06:14,864
Basically, gacha is like a chocolate egg with a toy,

111
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:17,227
or here you may know it as a kinder joy.

112
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:20,971
You have a random reward inside the egg,

113
00:06:21,852 --> 00:06:23,914
but even if you don't like this reward,

114
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:25,376
you still have the chocolate.

115
00:06:26,857 --> 00:06:28,119
And it is useful for you.

116
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,543
Every chocolate egg you buy, it is still useful to you.

117
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:37,667
The third principle you can use,

118
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:40,648
that actually real toy manufacturers

119
00:06:40,688 --> 00:06:42,449
can't use this principle, but we can,

120
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,250
it is creating illusion of randomness

121
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,630
instead of real randomness.

122
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,872
What I mean is, imagine that you are throwing

123
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:53,873
a pair of dices and you get snake eyes

124
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:55,213
five times in a row.

125
00:06:56,814 --> 00:06:58,954
This is how real randomness works.

126
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,101
It doesn't have to be fair, but we humans are upset with it,

127
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:05,582
and we perceive this as something unfair.

128
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:06,783
We want it to be regular.

129
00:07:07,604 --> 00:07:10,425
That is why, if you are designing the experience

130
00:07:10,485 --> 00:07:12,447
of players using random mechanics,

131
00:07:12,547 --> 00:07:14,328
if you're creating an illusion of randomness,

132
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:16,349
but it is regular all the time,

133
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,611
it will be much better for you

134
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:21,753
and for players in your game.

135
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,214
So we started releasing Gacha.

136
00:07:28,274 --> 00:07:30,756
The first one was on Halloween 2016

137
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:32,197
and it was a part of the event.

138
00:07:32,798 --> 00:07:35,580
At the time we had just one type of chests

139
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:40,564
and players played battles,

140
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:43,907
earned special event currency called pumpkins,

141
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,188
and opened the chests with rewards.

142
00:07:47,109 --> 00:07:48,771
There were different rewards inside it,

143
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:50,952
robots, weapons, currencies.

144
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:55,329
And the only UX feature we've added at the time

145
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:59,533
was that you could open multiple chests with just one tap.

146
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:00,533
That's all that we did.

147
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:06,338
We introduced it on the event just to have an insurance.

148
00:08:06,598 --> 00:08:10,421
If players didn't like this, then the event would be over

149
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:12,303
and the game returned to its previous state.

150
00:08:12,623 --> 00:08:14,064
But it was successful for us,

151
00:08:14,564 --> 00:08:15,906
and this is why we continued.

152
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:18,408
We made a second iteration on the New Year 17.

153
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:23,752
when we've added our version of the chocolate

154
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:28,775
in the Kinder Joy, which is when you are opening

155
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:33,659
every chest, a special progress bar fills a little.

156
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,582
And when it is filled completely,

157
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:40,884
player gets super reward that is useful

158
00:08:40,944 --> 00:08:42,065
to everyone in the game.

159
00:08:43,497 --> 00:08:44,338
That's how it works.

160
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:49,620
That's how works the fact that every opening of the chest,

161
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:52,262
no matter what will you receive inside,

162
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:54,543
will be useful to you.

163
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,525
The third iteration was on Lunar New Year 17

164
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:01,606
and we've added two more chests

165
00:09:01,886 --> 00:09:04,168
to address the needs of our game community.

166
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:06,749
Some players actually wanted these chests

167
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:10,331
to be a bit cheaper and some players wanted

168
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:14,112
the rewards to be better, and we've added premium chests

169
00:09:15,092 --> 00:09:20,174
with a higher price, and cheap chests with lower price,

170
00:09:20,234 --> 00:09:22,895
just so that you could play it as a lottery.

171
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,017
And actually, this was the first time

172
00:09:26,097 --> 00:09:27,757
when our game community signaled

173
00:09:28,258 --> 00:09:30,778
that they don't like how exactly

174
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,780
we are designing our monetization,

175
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,840
where the game is moved.

176
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:36,921
And

177
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:39,993
This wasn't a problem for us at the time

178
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,298
because the metrics were good,

179
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,850
there were no problems at all, and we just continued.

180
00:09:47,047 --> 00:09:50,010
The fourth iteration was on War Robots Birthday,

181
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:55,375
and we tried to avoid adding new event currencies.

182
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:59,679
And from now on, the chests were opened with hard currency,

183
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:01,301
with usual hard currency of the game.

184
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:03,283
In this way, we've created a loop

185
00:10:03,723 --> 00:10:06,986
where a player opens the chest, gets the hard currency,

186
00:10:07,426 --> 00:10:10,309
and they can use it to open the next chest.

187
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,490
But this wasn't a successful thing for us

188
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,431
because players' feedback was that

189
00:10:18,712 --> 00:10:22,053
in-game hard currency was too valuable for them.

190
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:24,633
They didn't want to spend it on opening the chests.

191
00:10:25,353 --> 00:10:28,134
That is why we returned to the previous state,

192
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:33,275
but we recreated loops with our event currencies

193
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:35,236
on the 4th of July.

194
00:10:36,296 --> 00:10:39,997
Now, why we experimented with this feature so many times?

195
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,198
Why we did it in so many iterations?

196
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:45,999
The answer is actually on this chart.

197
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:47,179
It is our revenue chart.

198
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,920
And you can see that every time we've added

199
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,581
gacha to our events, every time it was a spike in the revenue.

200
00:10:57,637 --> 00:11:00,457
That is why we understood that we actually want to add

201
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:03,658
this mechanics to the game permanently.

202
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:07,659
And we did it in September 2017.

203
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:09,259
It was designed as follows.

204
00:11:09,499 --> 00:11:11,240
There were three special currencies,

205
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,380
key cards, red, green, and blue.

206
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,741
And they represented time-limited seasons.

207
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,342
So that when one season ends,

208
00:11:19,842 --> 00:11:23,002
and for instance, you get compensations for red key cards

209
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:27,243
in different currencies or other types of rewards.

210
00:11:28,484 --> 00:11:33,409
And now we have to use green key cards to open chests.

211
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,633
In this way, we actually prevented key cards

212
00:11:36,713 --> 00:11:38,875
from stacking up on players' accounts.

213
00:11:42,305 --> 00:11:44,166
This was a very successful feature for us.

214
00:11:45,307 --> 00:11:48,509
Actually, I might say that this was the most successful

215
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:50,751
feature for our robots in terms of financial games

216
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:53,013
because we had two or three times increase

217
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:54,193
of our revenue at the time,

218
00:11:54,734 --> 00:11:56,555
and we thought that it is a new plateau

219
00:11:56,575 --> 00:11:57,576
for our robots actually.

220
00:12:01,403 --> 00:12:04,986
We now had the fuel to continue our experiments

221
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:08,209
with monetization and we've added more features

222
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:11,972
like wild offer system, I'll talk about it later,

223
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,355
and the other versions of indirect sale system

224
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:20,118
because basically what gacha is in our game,

225
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,301
it is a way to sell your

226
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:30,383
content indirectly to players, to hide the real price of this unit, because player

227
00:12:30,863 --> 00:12:36,204
doesn't know how many chests they have to open to get this unit.

228
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,365
And we've added component system.

229
00:12:41,466 --> 00:12:47,747
It was our way to sell half of the robot. From that point you could

230
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:53,768
offer players 5,000 components when, for instance, they need 10,000 to craft a robot.

231
00:12:57,012 --> 00:13:02,356
But the market changed, and there was a big media scandal

232
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:03,897
around Star Wars Battlefront II,

233
00:13:04,257 --> 00:13:06,878
and I remember that some players even joked about it,

234
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:11,001
like, imagine if Darth Vader cost not 40 bucks,

235
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:15,164
but 300 bucks, implying our the most expensive robot

236
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:15,644
in the game.

237
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:21,281
We looked at it, but still game metrics were good.

238
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:23,403
There weren't any problems on the game metrics.

239
00:13:23,483 --> 00:13:26,746
The retention was fine, the conversion rates,

240
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,587
monetization, everything was good.

241
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:31,530
The only problem was on the iOS rating.

242
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,073
This drop wasn't very big, but it was significant for us.

243
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:41,602
And we've definitely, we've won in terms of money

244
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:44,004
with this feature, but we've lost something.

245
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:47,588
And first of all, players actually reached

246
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:50,230
every developer they could through social media

247
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:55,015
and wrote them, you're bad, you suck,

248
00:13:55,656 --> 00:13:57,077
we don't like what you do with the game.

249
00:13:58,598 --> 00:14:02,042
And people started to be ashamed of what they're doing.

250
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,985
It's like, imagine you're working on one of the best

251
00:14:06,065 --> 00:14:07,506
mobile shooters in the world,

252
00:14:08,386 --> 00:14:09,507
and you don't like what you do.

253
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:11,268
That was a problem for us,

254
00:14:11,368 --> 00:14:13,909
and it turned into

255
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,411
slower production.

256
00:14:17,651 --> 00:14:20,232
The features made after that were made slower

257
00:14:21,032 --> 00:14:24,414
because people were really afraid to get another wave

258
00:14:24,674 --> 00:14:27,316
of hatred from our community.

259
00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:31,917
That was the first time for us when we understood

260
00:14:31,977 --> 00:14:33,558
that we are doing something wrong

261
00:14:33,658 --> 00:14:35,360
and we need to change this thing.

262
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:39,745
Now, to the second model example,

263
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:42,007
which is wild offers system.

264
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,589
Basically, what is wild offers?

265
00:14:44,395 --> 00:14:47,619
It is a system that generates offers to players

266
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,443
with discounts, and it can offer different things

267
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:54,668
like robot setups, weapons, equipment, resources,

268
00:14:54,988 --> 00:14:56,470
all kinds of stuff.

269
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:00,555
But these offers are generated randomly.

270
00:15:01,195 --> 00:15:06,357
with some algorithm inside of the boundaries

271
00:15:06,477 --> 00:15:08,577
set by the game designer on the backend.

272
00:15:08,597 --> 00:15:10,578
For instance, a game designer determines

273
00:15:10,638 --> 00:15:13,839
like the discount should be no less than 10%

274
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:17,220
and no more than 25%, for instance.

275
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,001
Or you can offer this type of robot,

276
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:23,121
this kind of weapon, but you can't offer this type of robot.

277
00:15:23,842 --> 00:15:25,603
And that's how it basically works.

278
00:15:26,284 --> 00:15:29,447
The design pillars of this system were as follows.

279
00:15:29,848 --> 00:15:31,729
First of all, it was iterative approach.

280
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,853
In the beginning, we don't know anything about our user

281
00:15:36,794 --> 00:15:39,397
and we just bombard them with offers.

282
00:15:39,477 --> 00:15:41,699
We are firing a shotgun of offers to them.

283
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,163
And you can see here an imaginary dialogue

284
00:15:45,183 --> 00:15:46,524
between the system and the user.

285
00:15:46,924 --> 00:15:47,805
And at first it just...

286
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:50,829
offers different kinds of animals to them.

287
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:53,712
But at some point, the system understands

288
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,295
that this particular user likes lions,

289
00:15:56,836 --> 00:16:00,660
and now it tries to offer them accessories for lions.

290
00:16:01,882 --> 00:16:04,645
In this way, we get from grapeshot shooting

291
00:16:05,226 --> 00:16:08,129
to very aimed sniper precision offers.

292
00:16:10,162 --> 00:16:12,383
The second principle is bargaining.

293
00:16:12,463 --> 00:16:15,264
It is basically, if you're turning down the offer,

294
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,945
the next offer you'll get will be better.

295
00:16:18,406 --> 00:16:21,427
It will have lower price or higher value.

296
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:25,229
But if we used only these two principles,

297
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:29,051
the best behavior to address this system

298
00:16:29,091 --> 00:16:30,852
would be to turn down every offer,

299
00:16:30,892 --> 00:16:31,952
to decline every offer,

300
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:34,413
till you get the maximum value for the lowest price.

301
00:16:36,094 --> 00:16:37,935
That is why we've added the third principle,

302
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:40,336
which is randomness to avoid predictability.

303
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:43,737
We've inserted random noise offers

304
00:16:44,197 --> 00:16:47,618
to make this system hardly readable for users.

305
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,899
And here we can see some absurd things.

306
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,061
White ones are the noise offers,

307
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:57,222
and spelled in black are the real target offers.

308
00:16:57,722 --> 00:17:01,283
And they are just here to disguise our algorithm,

309
00:17:01,543 --> 00:17:01,943
that's all.

310
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:03,844
Sometimes, actually, they work,

311
00:17:03,864 --> 00:17:05,445
sometimes players buy them.

312
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,341
This system, of course, it has some drawbacks.

313
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:13,123
And first of all, it generates a lot of data.

314
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:18,145
Imagine you have to save all the transaction history with this system for every user.

315
00:17:18,686 --> 00:17:21,827
And it's quite heavy on the backend.

316
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:25,849
And it's even harder to analyze this ocean of data.

317
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,150
And the best way I think here is segmentation.

318
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:33,071
If you are dividing players into cohorts

319
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:37,052
and try to find correlations between player behavior

320
00:17:37,252 --> 00:17:39,392
and some offers, then it will work.

321
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:41,772
The second problem is revenue cannibalization.

322
00:17:41,972 --> 00:17:46,093
Since the basic tool of this system is offering discounts,

323
00:17:46,953 --> 00:17:48,714
if discounts are too high,

324
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:51,434
then you probably will cannibalize your revenue.

325
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:53,815
So you need to control this thing.

326
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:57,926
and sometimes it is difficult for us

327
00:17:58,006 --> 00:17:59,826
to understand what player needs,

328
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,787
because we know his payment history,

329
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:06,088
we know his transaction history with the system,

330
00:18:06,448 --> 00:18:08,208
but sometimes it's hard for us to understand

331
00:18:08,508 --> 00:18:10,869
their play style, their desires in the game.

332
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:14,169
Maybe this player likes brawler robots,

333
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:16,350
or this player likes sniper robots.

334
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,750
Right now we have the only trigger here,

335
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,851
it is a workshop system where you can craft.

336
00:18:23,511 --> 00:18:24,512
components for robots.

337
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:27,856
And we know that if a particular player

338
00:18:28,738 --> 00:18:31,681
crafts a lot of components of this robot,

339
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:34,264
then probably we can offer him more components of this robot

340
00:18:34,305 --> 00:18:36,788
or maybe we can offer him the whole robot itself.

341
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:43,801
We did some optimizations of the wild offers.

342
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:46,863
First of all, we've increased the frequency

343
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:47,924
of generating offers.

344
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:49,805
In the beginning, it was once per day,

345
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:53,368
and we've increased it to twice per day, offer shown,

346
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:56,350
and actually it worked.

347
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,373
The second thing we did was faster movement

348
00:19:00,433 --> 00:19:03,735
between price tiers, from low price tiers

349
00:19:03,795 --> 00:19:05,076
to high and vice versa.

350
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:11,088
So that now, if you buy a $5 offer, for instance,

351
00:19:11,168 --> 00:19:14,615
you maybe will get a $40 offer next.

352
00:19:16,296 --> 00:19:19,237
just so that the system tries to make leaps

353
00:19:19,318 --> 00:19:21,078
between tires to move quickly.

354
00:19:22,139 --> 00:19:26,181
And finally, we've increased the cap of the initial offer

355
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:29,223
when we don't know anything about our user to $20.

356
00:19:29,643 --> 00:19:30,583
In the beginning it was $10,

357
00:19:30,663 --> 00:19:37,087
because on average it is the most comfortable price

358
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:40,128
for most of the players, just statistics.

359
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:45,770
But when we increased it to $20, it resulted in a higher revenue.

360
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:50,651
You can see below the real revenue chart of the system after the optimization we did.

361
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,571
It was just in one release.

362
00:19:54,332 --> 00:19:59,153
Now, let's try to compare these two systems in terms of revenue.

363
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,113
And here you can see the paying user percentage.

364
00:20:03,034 --> 00:20:09,495
The yellow chart is gacha, and our green chart is wild offer system.

365
00:20:10,635 --> 00:20:13,437
and you can see that they resemble very much

366
00:20:13,697 --> 00:20:17,499
the initial charts I've showed you in the beginning.

367
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,702
By the way, the drop down of the weld offers afterwards

368
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:25,003
doesn't relate to its design.

369
00:20:25,744 --> 00:20:27,605
We screwed it up, but in a very different way,

370
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:29,146
and it's completely different story.

371
00:20:31,246 --> 00:20:33,588
Now let's see at the revenue.

372
00:20:34,288 --> 00:20:35,189
Let's look at the revenue.

373
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:38,713
Here you see a gacha system in light green

374
00:20:38,873 --> 00:20:41,515
and wild offer system in yellow.

375
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:44,998
Probably it would be easier for you

376
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,562
if I show you just these two sources here.

377
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:51,574
You can see that in the beginning,

378
00:20:51,594 --> 00:20:53,476
Gacha generated a lot of revenue,

379
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:54,758
most of the revenue of the game.

380
00:20:55,058 --> 00:20:56,280
But later it declined,

381
00:20:57,021 --> 00:21:01,667
because it has lost its value to our players.

382
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:07,053
What are the results of this new approach?

383
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,844
First of all, our morale started to grow,

384
00:21:11,585 --> 00:21:14,809
and not just because of making these two features,

385
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,831
we did a lot of UX improvements

386
00:21:16,891 --> 00:21:19,614
requested by our players in 2018,

387
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,779
and right now our user rating is higher than ever before,

388
00:21:23,939 --> 00:21:25,741
and that is, of course, good.

389
00:21:26,762 --> 00:21:29,963
Our revenue is much more stable and predictable now,

390
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:33,924
since we don't have a lot of fluctuations

391
00:21:34,604 --> 00:21:36,264
made by the gacha before.

392
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:40,586
And it is much easier for our marketing team and analytics

393
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,467
to plan user acquisition for one year, for instance.

394
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,788
What we've learned from these two examples.

395
00:21:51,074 --> 00:21:54,197
First of all, long-term planning for us works much better,

396
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:56,920
because it helps us to build trust

397
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,104
between our studio and investors.

398
00:22:00,504 --> 00:22:03,187
They see much more stable behavior of the game.

399
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:07,635
And actually, if you think long-term,

400
00:22:08,255 --> 00:22:12,238
it is easier to get the desired result

401
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,541
some time afterwards.

402
00:22:16,282 --> 00:22:18,243
You shouldn't definitely underestimate

403
00:22:18,283 --> 00:22:20,105
the influence of your community,

404
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,428
because even if it isn't shown in any metrics,

405
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,830
still it will be significant.

406
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:28,832
After all, we are all humans.

407
00:22:29,787 --> 00:22:34,629
And for us, uncontrollable growth was not a very good thing.

408
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:38,351
We wanted to grow, of course, and it helped us,

409
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:43,293
but it's hard to plan long-term budgets,

410
00:22:43,874 --> 00:22:47,536
and it's hard to plan long-term development of the studio

411
00:22:48,216 --> 00:22:51,918
if your revenue chart is very fluctuating like this.

412
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:58,095
Well, basically, what I wanted to say here

413
00:22:58,235 --> 00:23:00,556
is not just gacha is evil, no.

414
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:03,837
You can use gacha, and I know a lot of games

415
00:23:03,957 --> 00:23:07,078
where gacha is designed in a way

416
00:23:07,218 --> 00:23:09,119
according to principles of value growth.

417
00:23:09,619 --> 00:23:12,240
Actually, I just wanted to demonstrate these two approaches

418
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:17,662
and to tell you that you always have to understand

419
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:19,503
the consequences of each approach.

420
00:23:20,323 --> 00:23:26,428
For instance, we could do the same, we could design Gacha along with value growth principles,

421
00:23:26,528 --> 00:23:32,853
but in this case, probably we didn't have as high revenue spike as we got,

422
00:23:32,893 --> 00:23:39,058
because in this case, we couldn't squeeze so many payments from our players.

423
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:41,820
So, that is all. Thank you.

424
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,113
If you have any questions, please ask.

425
00:23:51,356 --> 00:23:52,378
Oh, there is the mic.

426
00:23:53,595 --> 00:23:56,597
Yeah, I had a question. So your wild offers.

427
00:23:57,617 --> 00:24:01,919
So what we've seen is like in a lot of games where you discount your currency and

428
00:24:01,939 --> 00:24:05,740
your offers that like over time people kind of just devaluate them and then you

429
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,762
have to constantly be creating more. Yeah. So it is a problem with your wild offers.

430
00:24:09,842 --> 00:24:13,563
How, how do you go about kind of managing that? Um, like,

431
00:24:13,623 --> 00:24:15,384
what are your thoughts about how you, how you,

432
00:24:15,844 --> 00:24:20,326
how much you discount and how often you discounted? Okay. Um,

433
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,587
what I've found is that

434
00:24:24,716 --> 00:24:27,397
in-game currencies lose value to players

435
00:24:27,677 --> 00:24:29,237
if you do it irregularly.

436
00:24:29,797 --> 00:24:32,417
And player knows, for instance, that,

437
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:35,738
okay, I didn't have to buy it right now

438
00:24:35,858 --> 00:24:39,299
because I know there will be a sale next month

439
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:40,639
and I'll buy it then.

440
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:45,520
If it is more spatial, more random,

441
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,540
and they don't know what exactly will happen next month,

442
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,420
in this case, it is okay.

443
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:51,961
It doesn't devaluate.

444
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:52,921
I think so.

445
00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:59,171
Yeah, here you go.

446
00:24:59,231 --> 00:24:59,431
Sure.

447
00:24:59,812 --> 00:25:02,474
So I was wondering, this is really fascinating.

448
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,917
And you mentioned one of the big problems for Gacha

449
00:25:05,057 --> 00:25:07,760
is the backlash coming from the community.

450
00:25:08,861 --> 00:25:11,083
But sometimes people backlash when

451
00:25:11,123 --> 00:25:14,446
they realize they are paying different prices for the same

452
00:25:14,526 --> 00:25:15,467
item in the game as well.

453
00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:18,069
Did you see anything over there?

454
00:25:18,189 --> 00:25:22,213
Because I think it's a really clever get around of the issue

455
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:23,313
of hiding the price.

456
00:25:23,394 --> 00:25:26,076
And you're essentially having price discrimination,

457
00:25:26,116 --> 00:25:28,318
making sure people are paying what they're willing to pay.

458
00:25:29,058 --> 00:25:32,941
But do you see people responding negatively to that?

459
00:25:33,022 --> 00:25:35,764
Or they're generally not really talking to each other about,

460
00:25:35,824 --> 00:25:36,184
oh, you got $5.

461
00:25:36,544 --> 00:25:37,265
Why do I need to pay $10?

462
00:25:40,192 --> 00:25:49,965
Do you mean that people get different offers and that is why they could be upset so that they don't have an offer a particular, for instance, their friend?

463
00:25:50,225 --> 00:25:50,565
Correct.

464
00:25:53,796 --> 00:25:59,620
Yes, this is a problem and it relates a lot to some kind of payment terrorism.

465
00:25:59,861 --> 00:26:03,083
For instance, if you differentiate the prices between countries,

466
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:08,687
then a lot of players will have a way to deceive the system

467
00:26:08,747 --> 00:26:10,689
and to change the country to get lower prices.

468
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:16,472
But if it is not related to anything like the country

469
00:26:16,612 --> 00:26:18,494
or the language or something like that,

470
00:26:19,214 --> 00:26:22,756
you can always say, and that's what our support guys say,

471
00:26:23,196 --> 00:26:25,238
that this is the complex algorithm.

472
00:26:25,978 --> 00:26:30,001
It takes some time to get you the right offer.

473
00:26:30,041 --> 00:26:31,081
Just wait, you'll get it.

474
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,243
And mostly it works.

475
00:26:33,263 --> 00:26:35,004
Okay, thank you.

476
00:26:37,417 --> 00:26:44,303
You just are not familiar with war robots that deeply, but you went through this slide that I thought was really interesting,

477
00:26:44,323 --> 00:26:50,308
but you went through it pretty fast where it's like before, like basically you were selling gacha for hard currency for a period,

478
00:26:50,328 --> 00:26:55,813
but then in the next iteration, you offered gacha with three different currencies.

479
00:26:55,873 --> 00:26:57,955
Can you elaborate on that and just like how it worked exactly?

480
00:26:58,315 --> 00:26:59,276
Yeah, key cards.

481
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:00,585
Oh yeah, the key cards.

482
00:27:00,605 --> 00:27:01,827
So how did the key cards...

483
00:27:03,449 --> 00:27:05,271
They were seasonal or event based?

484
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:09,990
they are still earned from battles,

485
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:13,992
but they change one after another.

486
00:27:14,872 --> 00:27:16,673
Red key cards are compensated,

487
00:27:16,773 --> 00:27:19,194
and then you have to earn green key cards.

488
00:27:20,835 --> 00:27:23,116
Because actually, we didn't want our players

489
00:27:23,236 --> 00:27:26,618
to stack up a lot of key cards on their accounts,

490
00:27:26,658 --> 00:27:29,139
because it would be difficult for us

491
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:32,921
to sell things in the future.

492
00:27:35,897 --> 00:27:42,518
That was sort of similar to my question was I was curious to know how you design that kind of the token and economy of

493
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:45,439
these different soft currencies versus the hard currency

494
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:51,061
So can you explain a little bit about the thinking and the design of how many of these currencies you had?

495
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:55,802
I mean you spoke just right right now about how you didn't want people to kind of hoard these things

496
00:27:55,822 --> 00:27:59,043
How do you build sort of mechanisms where people are sort of incentivized to get rid of them?

497
00:27:59,623 --> 00:28:06,952
And then you mentioned also that if players understand that these currencies kind of come and go, that they lose value over time.

498
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:16,152
So that's curious to me because the game we're building is very heavily influenced on currencies and things like that.

499
00:28:16,252 --> 00:28:27,556
So we'd love to hear your thoughts and your design around the soft currencies and sort of how that fit into the hard currency side of things and your revenue model.

500
00:28:28,256 --> 00:28:33,158
You see the only purpose of key cards was just opening chests.

501
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:39,281
So it doesn't lose value because you can't spend them on anything else.

502
00:28:39,601 --> 00:28:41,201
So they're non-tradable and you could...

503
00:28:41,602 --> 00:28:43,962
they were acquired through grinding, just playing the game?

504
00:28:44,203 --> 00:28:46,303
Yeah, you can acquire them through grinding.

505
00:28:46,644 --> 00:28:49,525
But if you don't use them for...

506
00:28:50,205 --> 00:28:53,526
we have a season like a couple of months, I think.

507
00:28:53,806 --> 00:28:54,747
I don't remember exactly.

508
00:28:55,087 --> 00:28:56,648
But if you're using them...

509
00:28:58,368 --> 00:29:04,690
If you don't use them when the season ends you get the compensations in other currencies for that

510
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,151
keycards, so

511
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:14,793
Even if player doesn't use this they are still valuable to them. Okay. I'll look to ask more questions later. Thanks

512
00:29:16,075 --> 00:29:22,260
Hello. Have you experimented with the length of the offer that is available to the user after he receives it?

513
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:29,787
And what is the optimal time? And the same question goes for the amount of offers that is available to the user at once.

514
00:29:31,468 --> 00:29:35,049
Yeah, we've experimented with the length of showing the offer.

515
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,770
At first it was just one hour,

516
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:41,992
because we wanted to make it, to create some time pressure.

517
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,133
But actually it didn't work well.

518
00:29:45,854 --> 00:29:51,496
And right now it just has offers shown for half of the day,

519
00:29:51,836 --> 00:29:54,877
and then they are changed with next offers.

520
00:29:55,378 --> 00:30:00,387
So for us, time pressure didn't work well,

521
00:30:00,588 --> 00:30:01,850
especially because...

522
00:30:03,856 --> 00:30:09,358
The timer wasn't related to player

523
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,320
opening the screen of offers,

524
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,821
but it was related for player to opening the game.

525
00:30:16,361 --> 00:30:18,702
And in this way, actually, some offers,

526
00:30:19,823 --> 00:30:21,203
players didn't see them at all.

527
00:30:22,264 --> 00:30:23,324
That was a bug, we fixed it.

528
00:30:26,045 --> 00:30:29,547
So right now, we just, we are showing these offers

529
00:30:29,687 --> 00:30:31,788
for half a day and then change with another.

530
00:30:34,028 --> 00:30:42,217
Hey, so great talk. I was wondering though, you mentioned a couple of what seemed like really high price points at one point, $40 or $300.

531
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:50,206
I was wondering, does it seem like you make a significant portion of revenue from those handful of players who can spend that much money?

532
00:30:50,627 --> 00:30:53,610
Or is it mostly coming from players who can spend a lot less?

533
00:30:55,792 --> 00:30:58,535
We aren't unique here on mobile market

534
00:30:58,615 --> 00:31:02,018
and most of our money comes from people that spend a lot.

535
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,681
They are frequently called whales,

536
00:31:05,862 --> 00:31:08,865
but that's not a very good name for them.

537
00:31:08,905 --> 00:31:12,788
I think these people treat your game as a hobby

538
00:31:13,729 --> 00:31:16,152
and we usually, if we like something,

539
00:31:16,612 --> 00:31:18,874
we are ready to spend a lot of money on it.

540
00:31:19,315 --> 00:31:30,570
Yeah, so I think we have most of the revenue from people who spend more than $1,000 in our game.

541
00:31:31,251 --> 00:31:31,531
Thanks.

542
00:31:34,555 --> 00:31:37,519
Okay, that's all, right? Okay, thank you for coming.
