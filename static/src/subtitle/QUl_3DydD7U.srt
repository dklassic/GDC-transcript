1
00:00:06,703 --> 00:00:12,326
Welcome everyone to a talk on Civilization 6. I'm Ed Beach from Firaxis Games. I've been the

2
00:00:12,366 --> 00:00:18,230
lead designer on Civilization 6 that was released last October. My talk here is going to run

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:24,793
about 45 minutes, giving us some time for questions at the end. I want to thank the GDC

4
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:31,817
folks for the way they scheduled things this morning. They put Sid Meier's Civ 1 post-mortem

5
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:34,758
talk right before mine, so it got all the Civ fans here before.

6
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,991
How many people actually came to that talk as well?

7
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:40,393
OK, so actually a good percentage of the audience.

8
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,255
Just wanted to invite you to take one more talk with me

9
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:45,055
right now.

10
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:49,957
So in that Civ tradition, we'll take another turn here

11
00:00:50,297 --> 00:00:51,438
and move forward.

12
00:00:52,338 --> 00:00:55,620
Now, jumping forward into the future 25 years and talking

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,600
about Civilization VI.

14
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,479
So, one of the things I'm going to focus on during my talk is

15
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:06,200
about how many people have opinions about Civilization games

16
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,641
and about Civilization VI.

17
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,081
So, I'm sure there are quite a few opinions out there

18
00:01:11,101 --> 00:01:11,622
in the audience.

19
00:01:11,802 --> 00:01:16,263
And so, I've been told that we can even spill over a little bit

20
00:01:16,763 --> 00:01:19,403
on time at the end if we want to fielding questions.

21
00:01:20,224 --> 00:01:23,284
So, if anyone does have questions, I'm happy to take

22
00:01:23,324 --> 00:01:25,665
them at the end and we can dive into things

23
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:27,785
in as much detail as you want.

24
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:31,204
So anyways, let's go ahead and get started.

25
00:01:31,944 --> 00:01:35,667
The first thing I want to do is just give everyone a quick refresher

26
00:01:36,707 --> 00:01:38,028
on the Civilization series.

27
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:42,631
In the beginning,

28
00:01:43,932 --> 00:01:45,613
the Earth was without form

29
00:01:47,114 --> 00:01:47,775
and void.

30
00:01:51,357 --> 00:01:53,819
The sun shone upon the sleeping Earth.

31
00:01:55,532 --> 00:02:01,554
Into this swirling maelstrom of fire, air and water, the first stirrings of life appeared.

32
00:02:01,574 --> 00:02:07,816
The seeds of life grew and strengthened, spread and diversified.

33
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:12,117
Now it required but one more ingredient.

34
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:18,180
To unite the quarreling tribes.

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,462
To harness the power of the land.

36
00:02:20,982 --> 00:02:24,025
To build a legacy that will stand the test of time.

37
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:25,886
A civilization. â™ª

38
00:02:25,986 --> 00:02:29,429
So, Civilization has now been six games,

39
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:29,890
25 years,

40
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:36,936
five lead designers,

41
00:02:44,767 --> 00:02:49,250
dozens of intro movies, and quite a few animated leaders,

42
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,192
some of them a little slicker than others.

43
00:02:52,693 --> 00:02:54,394
I've seen the last eight of those years

44
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:56,375
and served as the lead designer since the

45
00:02:56,395 --> 00:02:59,157
Gods and Kings and Brave New World expansions to Civ V.

46
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:01,999
But that still means that when we started

47
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,942
the process for Civ VI design, the Civ series itself

48
00:03:06,022 --> 00:03:08,103
had been around seven times longer

49
00:03:08,223 --> 00:03:09,444
than I'd been a lead designer.

50
00:03:10,244 --> 00:03:11,785
So taking the reins of this series

51
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,387
was definitely a daunting proposition.

52
00:03:14,331 --> 00:03:21,894
To add to the pressure, Civ 6 launched, excuse me, Civ 5 launched in 2015. And one thing that you'll

53
00:03:21,954 --> 00:03:29,856
note about Civ 5 is it spent all six years right there in the top ten most played games on Steam.

54
00:03:30,697 --> 00:03:38,860
This screenshot is actually from the Steam stats page one week before Civ 6 released. And you

55
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,920
could see Civ 5 was doing.

56
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:50,412
doing quite well, still very healthy and in third place there. An additional factor going

57
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:58,638
into releasing Civ 6 last year was that 2016 was going to be the 25th anniversary of Civ 1. So

58
00:03:58,658 --> 00:03:59,318
we're going to have 25 years.

59
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,602
of the same franchise and there was a lot of attention both in

60
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:08,463
the media and in our marketing devoted to that 25th year

61
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:12,125
anniversary. You can see here we have a picture of Bruce Shelley

62
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:16,087
and Sid who just did the previous talk. Meeting with some

63
00:04:16,107 --> 00:04:19,729
of the other early CIV lead designers at the Dice Summit in

64
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:25,112
Las Vegas. It was about a year ago last February and that was

65
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:28,733
sort of a focal point for that conference was that

66
00:04:29,164 --> 00:04:34,888
panel where they were doing a retrospective on Civ. We also

67
00:04:34,928 --> 00:04:38,031
had a big marketing campaign that rolled out as the year was

68
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:43,436
going on. You can see here at E3 last year in LA, we had

69
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:47,599
Civilization VI themed stairways leading into the convention

70
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,843
center. We had a theater presentation narrated by Sean

71
00:04:51,863 --> 00:04:55,086
Bean, who you just heard in the trailer I just played for you.

72
00:04:56,207 --> 00:04:59,368
And there were a bunch of media events that were happening associated with Civ 6,

73
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:06,289
including our first event held on Facebook Live where we did a Q&A session

74
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:10,990
with our community manager and sort of answered a lot of the early questions

75
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,931
about what Civ 6 was going to be.

76
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:17,252
That session alone attracted a lot of attention.

77
00:05:18,512 --> 00:05:19,272
We definitely.

78
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:28,313
realized it was picking up some hits on Facebook when we had a certain man with 86 million

79
00:05:28,373 --> 00:05:35,219
followers on Facebook tune right into the stream and tell us Civ 6, I'm looking forward to it.

80
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,644
So it's an intense year. I definitely, I'm not going to lie, I'm not going to lie, I'm

81
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:44,669
You know, as being the lead designer for the first time,

82
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:46,932
I had a whole bunch of interesting experiences.

83
00:05:48,273 --> 00:05:51,537
But I did look forward to getting at least a slight break

84
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,299
from the action in the middle of the summer,

85
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:56,622
because one of the things I like to do every year

86
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:59,745
is go to a World Board Gaming Championships

87
00:06:00,286 --> 00:06:02,809
and both play and run some of the board gaming tournaments

88
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:03,069
there.

89
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,643
So, got this three, four day break, went to that tournament,

90
00:06:09,383 --> 00:06:12,886
and one of the things that I noticed was the sort of the Civ

91
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:16,829
VI hoopla followed me right into this event. So, one of the

92
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:19,330
lighter, more casual events I attend each year at this

93
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:24,434
convention is, it's really a comedy show disguised as a

94
00:06:24,474 --> 00:06:28,177
trivia game, hosted by John Corrado, who's kind of a friend

95
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:32,220
of mine, who I'm showing you on the screen here. John knew ahead

96
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,021
of time that I was going to be there.

97
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:37,493
And he kind of asked me early in the week, he's like, you going to be there?

98
00:06:37,513 --> 00:06:39,954
You don't mind if I bring up Civ 6 a little bit?

99
00:06:39,974 --> 00:06:42,475
And I was like, sure, go ahead, whatever you want to say, that's fine.

100
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:45,396
Well, I was in the audience.

101
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:47,597
In fact, I was right there in the audience.

102
00:06:48,537 --> 00:06:56,000
And John made no, had no hesitation about pointing that out to people and sort of diving in.

103
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,961
Like, we've got a Civ 6 lead designer here right now.

104
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:03,183
And he actually used it as a platform to kind of get across his message that.

105
00:07:04,053 --> 00:07:08,376
There's absolutely no pressure on you, Ed, but I love Civ 5 and

106
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:14,181
if you mess up Civ 6, you're in big, big trouble. Um, so...

107
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,200
Even on my breaks, I was having trouble getting away

108
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,321
from the Civ VI hoopla.

109
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:21,962
The only consolation I got out of that

110
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:24,602
was in this particular event, since he had themed it

111
00:07:24,782 --> 00:07:29,044
around Civilization VI because he wanted to highlight

112
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:32,565
my presence there, I did get a few categories

113
00:07:32,605 --> 00:07:35,766
that he chose for trivia that were sort of right up my alley.

114
00:07:35,906 --> 00:07:40,827
So we had 100 most played games on Steam.

115
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:45,805
And then the one that I definitely aced, just sort of ran that category right away.

116
00:07:49,408 --> 00:07:52,111
So, yeah, I know a little bit about the wonders of the ancient world by now.

117
00:07:54,092 --> 00:07:56,975
So maybe there was a little bit of pressure here.

118
00:07:57,555 --> 00:08:01,499
With that in mind, I kind of want to dive into...

119
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:04,988
you know, with a backdrop like this, with a successful series

120
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:08,710
that's been around for 25 years, how was our team going to go

121
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,011
ahead and attack this project? How would anyone designing the

122
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:20,915
next game in a hit series proceed? So, one other thing I

123
00:08:20,995 --> 00:08:24,217
noticed was that, um, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,

124
00:08:25,245 --> 00:08:28,506
this question of how do you proceed in a hit series

125
00:08:28,846 --> 00:08:30,666
was something that a lot of people were wondering about.

126
00:08:31,426 --> 00:08:33,427
In all those press interactions at E3

127
00:08:33,487 --> 00:08:34,587
and in some of the other interviews

128
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:37,808
we were doing last year, it was a repeated question.

129
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:40,689
They kept saying, how are you going

130
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:43,730
to find anything to add six games into the series?

131
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,411
And so I started thinking about that

132
00:08:47,971 --> 00:08:50,171
is something that's perplexing to a lot of people.

133
00:08:51,672 --> 00:08:52,492
It's something that.

134
00:08:53,457 --> 00:08:57,259
you know, is going to be applicable to lots of people in the game industry

135
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:02,102
because so much of our work and our titles are based around the fact that we

136
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:05,324
have an established franchise and we have to add on to it and augment it.

137
00:09:05,764 --> 00:09:09,526
And so that's why I got the idea that, yeah, maybe this is a worthy topic to

138
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:11,808
address here at GDC.

139
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:19,026
So I actually found it sort of an interesting question

140
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:23,889
because we had adopted a process that we'd used

141
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,651
kind of first with the Gods and Kings expansion.

142
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:30,373
And it sort of made that question not as difficult

143
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:33,876
as it seemed like the press was feeling like it should be.

144
00:09:34,796 --> 00:09:37,018
Because what we wanted to do when we were creating.

145
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:40,320
sort of any successor in the Civilization series,

146
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,462
whether it's an expansion pack like Gods and Kings,

147
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,643
or whether it's Civilization VI,

148
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,925
is we want to really take a hard look

149
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,467
at what we had done previously

150
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:53,210
and think about, as game players, as game designers,

151
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,592
what is working and what's not working.

152
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,602
And we did that as part of our development process for Gods and Kings.

153
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:06,425
We may not have had a whiteboard in the office that had exactly these lists of four items,

154
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:14,568
but we certainly came up with lists of items, these four items were all on them, and we

155
00:10:14,608 --> 00:10:16,269
do a lot of internal discussion.

156
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:18,790
We have an external beta test team.

157
00:10:19,991 --> 00:10:24,138
that is sort of like community leaders and giant fans of the series.

158
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:28,285
Some of them have been working with us for two or three titles in the series, maybe even longer.

159
00:10:28,946 --> 00:10:33,273
And we're sort of always looking at our game and what's working and what's not.

160
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:33,954
So.

161
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,991
Just a couple examples from the Civ V expansion packs,

162
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:41,132
in Gods and Kings, we were seeing that

163
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:44,874
the combat wasn't balanced the way it should be.

164
00:10:44,914 --> 00:10:49,856
There were cases where, because the rule of combat was

165
00:10:49,976 --> 00:10:50,857
every time you made an attack,

166
00:10:50,897 --> 00:10:52,698
you were always gonna do one hit point of damage,

167
00:10:52,758 --> 00:10:54,038
no matter how weak you were.

168
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,079
We were having situations where 10 archers

169
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,081
in the ancient realm could still be around,

170
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:03,442
facing something like a giant death robot

171
00:11:03,482 --> 00:11:04,443
in the modern times.

172
00:11:04,778 --> 00:11:08,443
And as long as you had 10 of them, you could take that giant death robot down.

173
00:11:08,804 --> 00:11:14,512
So, one of the things we introduced for Gods and Kings was a 100 hit point scale to better

174
00:11:14,552 --> 00:11:15,353
balance combat.

175
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,224
We had a problem that we were thinking we wanted to attack

176
00:11:22,105 --> 00:11:26,209
with the Civ V base game where players would get into a game world,

177
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:30,232
they'd get into a situation and they might have picked a civilization to play

178
00:11:30,252 --> 00:11:35,376
that just wasn't a very good fit or there wasn't any way for them to kind of customize the bonuses that they got

179
00:11:35,937 --> 00:11:40,420
so that they would really be adapted well for the terrain around their initial cities and for...

180
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,861
the type of victory they might want to pursue. And in Gods and

181
00:11:45,881 --> 00:11:48,502
Kings we were able to address that by adding a religion system.

182
00:11:49,782 --> 00:11:53,343
We also saw that there wasn't that much awareness of what the

183
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:58,084
AI was doing, that there was a lot going on in the depths of a

184
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:01,245
Civ 5 game that the AI was taking place in, but people

185
00:12:01,265 --> 00:12:04,786
weren't seeing that, and so we added an espionage system to

186
00:12:04,826 --> 00:12:05,346
address that.

187
00:12:06,306 --> 00:12:20,199
And then finally, the problem that we had was that the naval units, they were all attacking as range units, they were very one-dimensional, they weren't much threat to anyone's city because they weren't allowed to take it, and so for that expansion we added melee naval units.

188
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,824
And this process of sort of self-examination and...

189
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:32,228
you know, becoming critics of our own games and using those as springboards to figure

190
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:36,175
out what capabilities we were going to put in the expansion was something that we just

191
00:12:36,195 --> 00:12:36,837
kept going with.

192
00:12:37,317 --> 00:12:38,760
So we went into Brave New World.

193
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:45,000
And Brave New World, again, we made a list of items that we thought were still not working

194
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,861
right in Civ V, even with the Gods and Kings expansion.

195
00:12:49,742 --> 00:12:52,063
We felt like the culture victory was kind of bland.

196
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:57,585
It was just finish a certain number of social policy trees and then do one building project.

197
00:12:58,185 --> 00:13:00,887
So we added a tourism and great works system to address that.

198
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:07,696
We didn't like that with the new base movement rate of two spaces

199
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:10,959
in Civ V that the exploration game ended so quickly.

200
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,642
So we wanted to add more exploration later in the game

201
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:17,024
and we added an archeology system to address that.

202
00:13:18,225 --> 00:13:20,787
We felt like the diplomatic victory was pretty bland.

203
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:24,911
It was just a matter of kind of spending a lot of money

204
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:28,014
on city-states and that sort of was sort of a.

205
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:31,664
people called it an economic victory instead of a diplomatic victory because it's really

206
00:13:31,704 --> 00:13:36,529
how much money you had. And when we added the word Congress for Brave New World, it

207
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:41,514
really made that part of the game more interesting. And then there are a couple more items. You

208
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:50,003
can see the economic interdependencies didn't become as rich and as important until we

209
00:13:50,043 --> 00:13:52,125
added trade routes. And then that

210
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,441
sort of final push to victory, the climax at the end of the

211
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:59,363
game, the tension in the 20th century was addressed with our

212
00:13:59,443 --> 00:14:04,065
ideology system. So you can see again here, it was a matter of

213
00:14:04,565 --> 00:14:07,887
kind of really taking stock of where we were at, looking at

214
00:14:07,907 --> 00:14:11,029
what was working, what wasn't working, that was the way we got

215
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:14,750
those expansions to kind of flesh out the Civ V experience

216
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:18,952
and give you exactly what you get now when you play Civ V

217
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:21,013
complete. So that's sort of...

218
00:14:21,719 --> 00:14:24,660
where we started the Civ 6 work.

219
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,663
We looked at how we had proceeded with those expansions.

220
00:14:30,383 --> 00:14:33,445
We looked at how they were a matter of itemizing issues

221
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:36,706
and then using that as a springboard to move forward.

222
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:40,048
And we felt like even though Civ 5 was very successful,

223
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,469
was still being played a lot on Steam.

224
00:14:42,195 --> 00:14:46,356
you know, it was not a perfect game. There was plenty of opportunities to find places

225
00:14:46,437 --> 00:14:50,938
where we could improve it. And so we started going about making our list of what we wanted

226
00:14:50,958 --> 00:15:00,220
to address for Civ 6. Now one way that we really, you know, pushed this further is I have to

227
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,201
continue to give shout outs to our community.

228
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:07,556
We have a very engaged community, a very passionate community, but one thing that they always

229
00:15:07,716 --> 00:15:10,598
are good about is they're never short about giving us opinions.

230
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:16,482
And so it's always easy for us to go up there and, you know, if we're wondering about which

231
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:20,445
SIVs are overpowered or underpowered with the current release, they've already produced

232
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:22,827
a list for us and itemized all that for us.

233
00:15:23,347 --> 00:15:26,629
If they're telling us, if they want to tell us, you know, which system they like better

234
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:27,930
in SIV 4 and which one...

235
00:15:29,002 --> 00:15:31,784
went way downhill in the Civ 5 and is only finally making a

236
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:36,388
company, you know, all that data is up there. So, um, I see posts

237
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:38,629
now and again where the community people are like, did

238
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:41,451
Fraxis ever read this forums? I don't think they're paying any

239
00:15:41,491 --> 00:15:45,034
attention to us. That's totally ridiculous because, you know, I

240
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:47,856
have a whole office of designers that spend way too much of their

241
00:15:47,876 --> 00:15:50,377
day reading the forums. Sometimes I have to pull and

242
00:15:50,438 --> 00:15:53,039
don't read the forums right now. We need to, you know, buckle

243
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:53,420
down and...

244
00:15:54,827 --> 00:15:59,811
get going. So, one thing that I did when I was looking at what

245
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:02,733
they thought about Civ V, and this is the strategy form for

246
00:16:02,773 --> 00:16:05,716
Civ V just yesterday afternoon. I just pulled it down and pasted

247
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:10,220
it in here just so you can kind of see it's still hotly debating

248
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,763
things about how to get to the science victory as fast as

249
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:17,986
possible and posting guides for players who are trying to win on

250
00:16:18,006 --> 00:16:21,569
immortal and deity. One thing we noticed is that

251
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:27,979
they had looked at the tech tree and they had all sorts of plans for exactly how you attack the

252
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:35,580
tech tree. What is the optimal strategy? I'm not going to swear that this is the right optimal

253
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,561
strategy, this is just the one I pulled off Civ Fanatics yesterday, but I found it

254
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:44,042
interesting because with the arrows there and everything it's sort of a perfect example for me

255
00:16:44,822 --> 00:16:53,183
of how people found Civ V to sort of be a solved problem. They kind of, you know,

256
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:58,526
identified this one overarching problem that we kept coming up

257
00:16:58,586 --> 00:17:01,948
against, and that was that there was just a single path to

258
00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:04,809
victory that would always get you through the game

259
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:08,151
successfully. Didn't necessarily matter which map type, which

260
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:11,793
victory type you were going. If you follow, I think it's five

261
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:15,735
little mantras that I've got here that I got from the

262
00:17:15,755 --> 00:17:19,797
community, you were able to be successful and win a Civ 5 game.

263
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:21,258
So let's look at those.

264
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,201
Build only four cities.

265
00:17:26,042 --> 00:17:27,543
Rush to the National College.

266
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:30,345
Science is king.

267
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:35,589
Tradition for your social policies, not never liberty.

268
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,672
And get to rationalism as soon as you can.

269
00:17:40,598 --> 00:17:44,621
So those, I mean, they're probably more that the community focused on, but these were the

270
00:17:44,661 --> 00:17:50,286
kind of things I kept seeing over and over again. I kept going there and these were sort

271
00:17:50,306 --> 00:17:57,513
of the magic recipe to get you to a successful conclusion in a Civilization 5 game. And this

272
00:17:57,553 --> 00:18:03,378
was the number one thing I wanted to address for Civilization 6. I wanted to be sure that

273
00:18:03,418 --> 00:18:07,041
players were going to have to think on their feet. They were not going to be able to use

274
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:13,103
a couple key points every time. There was going to be situations that the game was going to

275
00:18:13,143 --> 00:18:16,425
throw at them that they were going to have to react to. They were going to have to think on

276
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:22,069
their feet. So you'll see as we go through the talk that that's sort of my number one

277
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:28,253
principle in terms of guiding us to what we're going to change for Civilization 6, how

278
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:33,416
we're going to change it, and then we'll wrap up at the end today and you'll kind of see how

279
00:18:33,436 --> 00:18:36,358
there was one key component to solving this problem.

280
00:18:40,193 --> 00:18:42,053
So I started thinking about solutions.

281
00:18:42,473 --> 00:18:45,854
And I'll sort of give away what the key component is right now.

282
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:48,915
But how it works into all the different things

283
00:18:49,135 --> 00:18:52,535
that we came up with is what we'll

284
00:18:52,595 --> 00:18:54,316
end up diving into more deeply.

285
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:58,097
So in order to come up with a solution to this problem

286
00:18:58,257 --> 00:19:01,697
about players being able to always use the same strategy

287
00:19:01,737 --> 00:19:06,158
to win, we had to look at what changes every time you

288
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,198
play a civilization game.

289
00:19:08,922 --> 00:19:13,265
because it's those things that are changing that are going to force players to think on

290
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:18,209
their feet. If they're presented with a situation that doesn't look like what they were faced

291
00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:24,314
with in the previous game, they're going to have to adjust. So, I love the Civilization

292
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:30,078
series. It's the perfect game for me working on because I love history, but also because

293
00:19:30,278 --> 00:19:30,859
I love maps.

294
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:34,799
And what changes every time you play is the map.

295
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,821
And that's sort of the most exciting time for, I think,

296
00:19:37,881 --> 00:19:38,822
a lot of civilization players.

297
00:19:38,842 --> 00:19:41,144
There are a lot of people who say, I play the beginning, see

298
00:19:41,184 --> 00:19:42,945
what the map looks like, explore it.

299
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,967
I may not finish that game because it's just so exciting

300
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:48,750
to get back to that point where I get to start a new game

301
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,832
again, and explore the map again, and dive back in.

302
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:53,994
So I knew that the map.

303
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,312
was sort of the key to what makes the civilization magic

304
00:19:58,412 --> 00:19:58,672
work.

305
00:19:59,893 --> 00:20:01,694
Sid and Bruce Shelley talked about that a little bit

306
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:03,534
in their talk about how important

307
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:06,676
it was to stick with randomizing the map every single time.

308
00:20:08,157 --> 00:20:10,358
And so that was going to be sort of the centerpiece

309
00:20:10,398 --> 00:20:12,159
of the solution for Civilization VI.

310
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:14,900
So what I'm going to do right now

311
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,781
is we're going to start taking a deeper dive.

312
00:20:16,821 --> 00:20:20,062
We're going to go into those areas on Civilization V

313
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:23,444
that I felt like we needed to make improvements.

314
00:20:23,908 --> 00:20:27,829
So we're going to dive into five different areas. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to

315
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:33,472
identify sort of what I see as the problem in Civ 5 and then talk about how we solve that for

316
00:20:35,732 --> 00:20:42,415
6. So the first area I want to look at is how tiles are used outside the city. And I looked

317
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:47,777
at how they were being used in Civ 5 and I felt like those decisions were kind of lacking. I

318
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:51,438
called them rote decisions because there wasn't a lot of thought being put into it.

319
00:20:52,173 --> 00:20:58,236
So if you look at this particular screenshot, it's just a nothing special. I just grabbed

320
00:20:58,296 --> 00:21:02,738
like the first Civ 5 screenshot I could find off the internet. But I started looking at the

321
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:09,000
improvements outside this city and you see farms are placed on the flat land, especially if

322
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,482
they're near the river. You've got mines anywhere there are hills or resources that require

323
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:19,004
mines. The resources that require a special...

324
00:21:20,013 --> 00:21:25,958
improvement like a plantation or a camp, they get that improvement. And pretty much all

325
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,820
those choices are automatic. You don't have to think about what you're doing with those

326
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:36,486
tiles. It's just automatic. There is one thing that we added for Civ 5 that was sort of a nice

327
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:42,691
hint at where we might be going for Civ 6. That last arrow that is put down in the corner,

328
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:48,495
that's showing you an academy, which is a great person building. And those sort of went

329
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:49,476
into any tile.

330
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:52,509
you know, that you wanted.

331
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:54,890
And the kind of interesting thing about that

332
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,831
was it was sort of always was one of your leftover spaces,

333
00:21:57,871 --> 00:22:00,172
whatever you considered like the least useful area you're

334
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,892
going to use for that.

335
00:22:01,373 --> 00:22:04,314
But at least it was you had to scan all the tiles

336
00:22:04,374 --> 00:22:05,955
around your city to try to figure out

337
00:22:06,015 --> 00:22:07,435
which was the best place for it.

338
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:10,036
And that was sort of what we decided

339
00:22:10,056 --> 00:22:13,398
we wanted people to be doing much more frequently in Civ 6.

340
00:22:13,578 --> 00:22:16,219
It was like having to look around all their city tiles,

341
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:18,580
look at all the possible places, and then

342
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,482
choose where their next move is going to be made.

343
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,336
So that's exactly where we went with Civ 6.

344
00:22:25,537 --> 00:22:29,421
And this is actually our unstacked city system.

345
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:35,147
That was a change that we were sort of dying to try, even

346
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,549
when we were in Civ 5 development.

347
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:40,673
We had really pressed, our development team really had

348
00:22:40,713 --> 00:22:43,316
pressed John Schaefer, the Civ 5 lead, to try to

349
00:22:44,432 --> 00:22:48,293
put the wonders out on the map. We knew the art would look a lot better. We knew it would

350
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:53,195
be interesting in terms of placement decisions. But I think John made the right call. There

351
00:22:53,235 --> 00:22:58,517
was a lot going on already with Civ V. We had taken the combat system and moved it out

352
00:22:58,597 --> 00:23:02,218
onto the map and unstacked all that with one unit per tile. And it would have been just

353
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:07,640
too much change at once. But these unstacked cities, you know, probably two years before

354
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,940
we started Civ VI, I knew that this was going to be...

355
00:23:10,942 --> 00:23:15,524
one of our number one features for that game. So you can see in this particular example, if

356
00:23:15,564 --> 00:23:23,747
you haven't played Civ 6, sort of how this works. We have a science campus up here, nestled

357
00:23:23,827 --> 00:23:31,190
up against the mountains. We have a commercial hub along the river, a holy site. It's also

358
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:36,592
inspiring for religious worship to have a mountain backdrop, so that's a good place to put

359
00:23:36,612 --> 00:23:37,473
it up against the mountains.

360
00:23:39,023 --> 00:23:43,585
And then also the fourth item here, the Hagia Sophia, that's one of the wonders outside the city.

361
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:53,808
And so what I think is so interesting about the way this works is now, rather than there's one use for every tile, with those tile improvements that I was showing you for Civ V,

362
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:59,250
we actually have at least three different layers of items that go outside your city.

363
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:06,013
Both the tile improvements from Civ V, these new districts that I'm showing you, because we pulled the buildings out of the city and put them out into the districts.

364
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:09,095
And then wonders as well have to go outside the city.

365
00:24:09,175 --> 00:24:11,597
So now you have those three competing layers

366
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,179
and they're all looking for a spot outside the city.

367
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,781
And now every time you're building in the city

368
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:19,963
you're having to make choices and trade-offs

369
00:24:20,403 --> 00:24:22,665
about how you're gonna use each of your tiles.

370
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:28,790
you can actually say that for a lot of our civilizations, we make it even worse for you

371
00:24:29,331 --> 00:24:35,076
because we add in unique improvements for that civilization. So like the Egyptians get the

372
00:24:35,157 --> 00:24:39,561
Sphinx, the Sumerians get the Ziggurat, and now you sort of have a fourth layer, where are we

373
00:24:39,581 --> 00:24:44,746
going to fit in unique improvements into this jumble? And then we said, well, there might be

374
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:48,109
some civilizations that don't get unique improvements, so...

375
00:24:49,341 --> 00:24:50,301
What are we going to do for them?

376
00:24:50,381 --> 00:24:54,462
They need to have that same just torturous situation

377
00:24:54,502 --> 00:24:56,463
as a player trying to figure out how to use every tile.

378
00:24:56,523 --> 00:24:59,503
So what we did is we went ahead and created some city states

379
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:03,204
that also, if you are allied with that city state,

380
00:25:03,244 --> 00:25:06,145
you get to temporarily use their ability

381
00:25:06,165 --> 00:25:07,385
to create unique improvements.

382
00:25:07,905 --> 00:25:11,026
So we have the colossal head unique improvement

383
00:25:11,046 --> 00:25:13,146
that's allowed outside the city.

384
00:25:13,206 --> 00:25:14,607
So maybe if your civilization doesn't even

385
00:25:14,627 --> 00:25:17,247
have unique improvements, you can go ahead

386
00:25:17,487 --> 00:25:18,768
and have to worry about them.

387
00:25:19,588 --> 00:25:26,292
So this is actually, it doesn't always happen in game development, but this is a system where we sort of had this pent-up desire to put it in.

388
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:35,276
We tried it in Civilization VI, in some of our earliest prototypes, years before we actually got to 2016 and shipped it, and it worked right away.

389
00:25:35,737 --> 00:25:40,699
So, definitely a success, but I'll get to some areas where we struggled quite a bit more.

390
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:47,823
Okay, so problem number two that I identified from Civ V was the way the tech tree worked.

391
00:25:48,685 --> 00:25:50,826
And if you came to Sid's talk earlier,

392
00:25:50,886 --> 00:25:52,888
you saw that the tech tree's been

393
00:25:52,908 --> 00:25:54,249
a huge part of civilization.

394
00:25:54,809 --> 00:25:58,011
It's pretty much worked the same way from Civ I

395
00:25:58,071 --> 00:26:03,315
all the way through to Civ V. And we kind of

396
00:26:03,335 --> 00:26:06,437
looked at it as a place where not much innovation had

397
00:26:06,497 --> 00:26:06,877
happened.

398
00:26:06,937 --> 00:26:07,838
Maybe we should look at it.

399
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:11,020
And there was one thing about the technology tree that

400
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,021
had always bothered me in civilization games.

401
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:14,582
So let's focus on that for a second.

402
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:21,586
So let's look at sort of the same screenshot I had up before, but now we're going to drill

403
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:27,410
into the top of the tree and look at the sailing line. And you can see sailing and optics are

404
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:34,556
both technologies there. Now, sailing takes 13 turns. Calendar takes 17 turns. It really

405
00:26:34,596 --> 00:26:38,799
doesn't matter what's going on in my game world. Those are always going to be proportionally

406
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:44,251
take the same amount of time, my people have just as good an opportunity to get into sailing

407
00:26:45,252 --> 00:26:50,454
as Calendar, even if I'm in the middle of the biggest continent you've ever seen and

408
00:26:50,514 --> 00:26:51,914
my people have never seen the ocean.

409
00:26:52,514 --> 00:26:54,215
And that just didn't make any sense to me.

410
00:26:54,515 --> 00:26:59,637
How are you guys learning about sailing when you have no water anywhere near your civilization?

411
00:27:00,617 --> 00:27:06,660
It just felt like the tech tree was off in this own disjoint universe that had nothing

412
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,360
to do with what was going on in your actual game world.

413
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,142
Why shouldn't those two be married together?

414
00:27:11,202 --> 00:27:13,284
Why shouldn't they have some interdependencies?

415
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:16,607
You know, the technology and the research of your people

416
00:27:16,647 --> 00:27:20,450
just needs to be something that is inherently tied

417
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,251
to what they have done so far

418
00:27:22,371 --> 00:27:23,452
and what they're about to do.

419
00:27:25,114 --> 00:27:25,854
So we looked at that.

420
00:27:27,536 --> 00:27:29,717
And one thing that we came up with was

421
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:31,799
it would be very interesting to go ahead.

422
00:27:32,607 --> 00:27:36,591
and come up with a system where you could trigger things by

423
00:27:36,731 --> 00:27:40,014
doing actions with other units or your cities out there in the

424
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:44,258
game world that was gonna be sort of gameplay directed

425
00:27:44,839 --> 00:27:50,124
actions that help you with this path through the game, with your

426
00:27:50,164 --> 00:27:53,067
progression through the technology tree. So...

427
00:27:55,688 --> 00:27:58,151
That's how sailing came to have a boost.

428
00:27:58,671 --> 00:28:00,412
Go ahead and found a city on the coast,

429
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,794
and all of a sudden, what we're gonna do

430
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:05,096
is fill up that half of that circle you see there.

431
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:09,960
So 50% of the credit towards the sailing technology research

432
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,201
is gonna be given to you for free

433
00:28:11,342 --> 00:28:12,703
if you can get a city on the coast.

434
00:28:13,323 --> 00:28:16,186
And we started out, it was tricky at first

435
00:28:16,306 --> 00:28:18,147
because the first time I sat down

436
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:21,270
and was looking at the ancient and classical tech trees,

437
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,352
and I had to come up with boosts for all of them,

438
00:28:24,392 --> 00:28:24,853
I was like.

439
00:28:26,174 --> 00:28:29,976
I got the sailing one nailed, but there are another 20

440
00:28:30,036 --> 00:28:32,737
technologies here, and what's going to make sense?

441
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:38,140
And that probably took me a full day and a half, two days

442
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,222
to come up with just the first cut of what that would be.

443
00:28:40,662 --> 00:28:43,824
And we put that in the game, and we played it that way for

444
00:28:43,944 --> 00:28:46,145
probably three or four months, just to make sure that the

445
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:46,885
system was working.

446
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,697
And everyone liked it right away, which was great.

447
00:28:50,778 --> 00:28:54,841
It led to sort of more directed play early in the game.

448
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:55,942
It gave you sub-goals.

449
00:28:56,283 --> 00:28:58,825
It sort of even gave us a way to tutorialize things.

450
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:02,368
Like if players aren't going to find a trade route because

451
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:05,671
they just never really found that particular unit, well,

452
00:29:05,691 --> 00:29:06,972
maybe we put it on the boost.

453
00:29:07,693 --> 00:29:09,253
you get a boost for making a trade route.

454
00:29:09,313 --> 00:29:11,294
And now all of a sudden people are like, oh, OK, I've got to

455
00:29:11,334 --> 00:29:12,454
figure out how to make a trade route.

456
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:13,534
That's going to be important to me.

457
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:18,975
So it had a whole bunch of positive outcomes that we were

458
00:29:19,015 --> 00:29:19,575
seeing right away.

459
00:29:19,595 --> 00:29:20,755
We were really excited about it.

460
00:29:21,356 --> 00:29:23,996
But I knew that I'd only spend that day and a half, two days

461
00:29:24,016 --> 00:29:25,817
to do the ancient classical boost.

462
00:29:25,957 --> 00:29:31,158
And I knew I had a whole five, six more epics worth of boosts

463
00:29:31,218 --> 00:29:32,298
I was going to have to come up with.

464
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:33,878
I kept putting that off.

465
00:29:34,478 --> 00:29:35,198
Probably it was like.

466
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:37,367
Six or nine months later, I actually

467
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:39,389
got around to doing boosts for the whole tree.

468
00:29:40,129 --> 00:29:43,512
And it was a little tough, but we ended up

469
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,034
finding a pattern that you look for things

470
00:29:46,154 --> 00:29:47,615
that you had unlocked recently.

471
00:29:48,116 --> 00:29:49,797
And if you haven't used those things,

472
00:29:49,877 --> 00:29:50,878
even though you've unlocked them,

473
00:29:51,518 --> 00:29:53,760
then perhaps you shouldn't be moving on

474
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,261
to the more advanced technologies.

475
00:29:55,581 --> 00:29:57,423
So it took a little while for us to figure out

476
00:29:57,523 --> 00:30:01,386
how to apply this kind of kernel of an idea that

477
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:02,667
worked really well in the ancient era

478
00:30:02,707 --> 00:30:03,768
throughout all of history.

479
00:30:05,187 --> 00:30:07,548
But overall, this was definitely a success and something that we

480
00:30:07,568 --> 00:30:12,049
didn't struggle with too, too much. But now I'm going to get

481
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:16,711
into something where we did struggle. And the problem here,

482
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:20,472
I already alluded to it before when I put up those mantras of

483
00:30:20,512 --> 00:30:24,853
the Civ 5 players, go to tradition, never go into liberty.

484
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:32,434
rush to rationalism as fast as you can. This social policy tree, we loved a lot of things

485
00:30:32,514 --> 00:30:39,120
it did. It was very thematic in terms of giving you things that culture could unlock for your

486
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:43,003
civilization and give you boosts. It was really...

487
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,712
sort of an integral part of what had happened with Brave New

488
00:30:46,732 --> 00:30:48,353
World, with our ideology system.

489
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:51,355
So we didn't want to throw this out.

490
00:30:51,395 --> 00:30:54,758
We wanted to keep the idea of social policies being items

491
00:30:54,818 --> 00:30:59,941
that could give you specialized boosts in a

492
00:30:59,981 --> 00:31:00,641
certain direction.

493
00:31:01,725 --> 00:31:07,486
But there were a couple problems that we felt like we had to address.

494
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:11,368
And I think the number one thing that we wanted to attack here in terms of social policies

495
00:31:11,988 --> 00:31:16,689
was we had sort of lost something that had been in the series previously with Civilization IV.

496
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:22,391
In Civilization IV, you had been able to, what a lot of players called, pivot their government.

497
00:31:22,911 --> 00:31:26,472
So something dramatic had happened. You went to war. You weren't expecting it.

498
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,348
or you're coming back from a war and you have to kind of rebuild your economy,

499
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:33,695
you could switch out civics, go back to things that you had

500
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:35,379
focused on before.

501
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,111
maybe jump ahead to things you haven't had before,

502
00:31:39,491 --> 00:31:41,733
but there was this sort of ability to kind of retune

503
00:31:42,154 --> 00:31:43,675
the way your society was working,

504
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,136
the way your government was set up,

505
00:31:45,856 --> 00:31:49,579
and that sort of gave players a lot of sense of control

506
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,242
and sort of like they were making policy decisions

507
00:31:53,262 --> 00:31:54,763
sort of like a government leader would

508
00:31:55,284 --> 00:31:56,985
in charting the future for their empire.

509
00:31:58,172 --> 00:32:02,074
So that was sort of a good thing that Civ IV had that we lost in

510
00:32:02,114 --> 00:32:04,976
Civ V because once you made a choice on a social policy on one

511
00:32:04,996 --> 00:32:09,378
of these trees, it was locked in. And what was worse is once you

512
00:32:09,898 --> 00:32:13,160
jumped into one of these trees and started developing it, we

513
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,203
gave you a big incentive to finish it. So we sort of locked

514
00:32:17,323 --> 00:32:21,165
in not only the choice of that one social policy that gets you

515
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:24,427
into the tree, but we sort of encouraged you to make a

516
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:27,168
commitment to keep going on that tree until you're finished.

517
00:32:28,117 --> 00:32:33,719
and that ended up just not being as configurable and as flexible

518
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,601
as what we wanted. So for Civilization VI, what we

519
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:41,782
started out with actually looked a little bit like this. Now,

520
00:32:41,802 --> 00:32:46,323
this is just in Visio. The next few slides were unearthed from

521
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:50,985
the archaeology system that is our design docs and going back

522
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:52,906
and pulling out screenshots from them.

523
00:32:53,786 --> 00:32:58,708
But you can see here what the Civ VI civic system, and yes, that is a tongue twister.

524
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,329
We realized that right away.

525
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:02,770
We were going to have problems pronouncing that.

526
00:33:03,871 --> 00:33:10,674
But the Civ VI civic system started with this design for social policies.

527
00:33:10,774 --> 00:33:12,175
Now, some of it survived.

528
00:33:12,195 --> 00:33:16,837
You can see right away it had military policies in sort of the orangish red

529
00:33:16,897 --> 00:33:18,618
and economic policies in the gold.

530
00:33:19,777 --> 00:33:24,002
the wild card and diplomatic policies we ended up with. Those were around from the beginning

531
00:33:24,022 --> 00:33:24,843
and we stuck with it.

532
00:33:26,822 --> 00:33:32,326
It had all these little sort of aqua blue unlocks associated

533
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:34,347
with every single social policy.

534
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:36,508
And it was similar to our boost system.

535
00:33:36,788 --> 00:33:39,670
I think we were too enamored with our tech boost system

536
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:40,231
at this point.

537
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,272
And we were going to make everything in the game

538
00:33:42,332 --> 00:33:43,052
unlock with that.

539
00:33:43,493 --> 00:33:45,494
And so why not every single social policy

540
00:33:45,554 --> 00:33:47,255
have a different unlock?

541
00:33:47,355 --> 00:33:49,496
Because we could come up with something that

542
00:33:49,536 --> 00:33:50,617
made sense for everything, right?

543
00:33:51,818 --> 00:33:58,708
So, so many unlocks, just way too many unlocks. It was, I don't even think we got this

544
00:33:59,168 --> 00:34:03,735
implemented before we started realizing there's just too much cognitive overload on the

545
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,619
player. There's no way they're going to be able to remember what they're pursuing.

546
00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:11,625
We did pair this with a list of governments

547
00:34:11,665 --> 00:34:12,465
that we wanted to have.

548
00:34:13,445 --> 00:34:16,006
And this, we changed a few of the names around,

549
00:34:16,106 --> 00:34:19,768
but this set of governments and the fact

550
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:22,589
that governments have different numbers of policy slots,

551
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:23,490
that stuck through.

552
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:27,911
But what we found with our players with this first system

553
00:34:28,572 --> 00:34:29,352
was they didn't know.

554
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,787
what they were doing in terms of how they were supposed to be

555
00:34:31,827 --> 00:34:34,948
progressing through that tree. There were things like we had

556
00:34:34,968 --> 00:34:37,209
this imperium government, it sounded really cool, maybe they

557
00:34:37,249 --> 00:34:40,390
should stick in that for a long time. Are they supposed to go

558
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,311
through all, you know, some players thought they should go

559
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:45,852
through all nine in order. And, you know, that's switching

560
00:34:45,892 --> 00:34:47,553
governments way more than we thought people should be doing.

561
00:34:47,593 --> 00:34:51,274
So it was just a little too chaotic and the progression

562
00:34:51,314 --> 00:34:53,015
path through these governments was unclear.

563
00:34:54,302 --> 00:34:56,004
So we didn't throw out all of this.

564
00:34:56,084 --> 00:35:00,207
We kept some of the code, but we had to redesign,

565
00:35:00,527 --> 00:35:01,688
refactor some things.

566
00:35:02,689 --> 00:35:05,070
And so our second try at the Civic System,

567
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:07,993
we did add government tiers.

568
00:35:08,633 --> 00:35:11,696
So that you could kind of at least get a sense

569
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:15,098
that these three governments were all more powerful

570
00:35:15,118 --> 00:35:15,979
than where you started.

571
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:20,020
But they were more on a par with each other,

572
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,541
so that you could kind of pick one,

573
00:35:22,661 --> 00:35:24,782
and you don't have to feel bad that you skipped the other two.

574
00:35:25,522 --> 00:35:27,203
And that just sort of made sense to players,

575
00:35:27,403 --> 00:35:30,003
that with a tier like this, we were anticipating

576
00:35:30,043 --> 00:35:31,804
you were going to switch governments at least three

577
00:35:31,844 --> 00:35:32,704
times during the game.

578
00:35:33,345 --> 00:35:34,945
And with this tier structure, all of a sudden,

579
00:35:35,345 --> 00:35:36,686
that just sort of fell into place.

580
00:35:36,946 --> 00:35:38,206
So that was a nice change.

581
00:35:39,627 --> 00:35:41,747
But we did have kind of this weird construct

582
00:35:41,787 --> 00:35:43,808
that we borrowed from Brave New World for how you

583
00:35:43,828 --> 00:35:45,128
get into the different tiers.

584
00:35:47,118 --> 00:35:50,660
we sort of were forcing an upgrade when a certain dramatic

585
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,041
event happened in the game.

586
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:56,264
And we actually kept the exact trigger for the last three

587
00:35:56,324 --> 00:35:59,146
governments that once you get a certain number of factories

588
00:35:59,306 --> 00:36:02,528
in your empire, you're going to have a big working class.

589
00:36:02,608 --> 00:36:05,390
And they were going to just dictate that you have to

590
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,371
govern them with one of the 20th century

591
00:36:07,451 --> 00:36:08,472
ideological governments.

592
00:36:10,593 --> 00:36:14,115
And we sort of felt like this interesting decision about

593
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:15,036
what government you're in.

594
00:36:15,638 --> 00:36:20,960
that we were trying to make kind of cool and fun and a new thing that was going to be

595
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:27,982
introduced for Civ 6 was kind of fighting against these forced upgrades that we were putting

596
00:36:28,022 --> 00:36:34,764
in play every time you hit one of these tiers. So we tried to relax that in our next

597
00:36:35,044 --> 00:36:38,105
version, Civics System version 3.

598
00:36:39,874 --> 00:36:45,958
And this one was notable because now we finally put in bonuses for the governments. We

599
00:36:45,978 --> 00:36:51,341
thought that if you get to pick, maybe you've unlocked the tier 2 governments but you

600
00:36:51,381 --> 00:36:56,104
really like that tier 1 government, it's really working for you right now. We wanted to

601
00:36:56,124 --> 00:37:00,727
let you stay in that but the incentive to staying in it would be if there would be bonuses

602
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:04,749
associated with those governments that you wanted to hang on to a little bit longer.

603
00:37:08,003 --> 00:37:12,991
we were getting somewhere, but we still had one big problem with the civic system. Um, and

604
00:37:13,051 --> 00:37:18,060
that was the fact that the way, I sort of hadn't really described how you...

605
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:24,005
um, move into a government, how you slot in a policy. But we had this really

606
00:37:24,085 --> 00:37:29,706
cumbersome system that all of this was done by spending culture. And you would

607
00:37:29,726 --> 00:37:34,027
sort of accumulate a treasury of culture, just like you do of gold. And every time

608
00:37:34,047 --> 00:37:37,528
you want to make some type of governmental change, you would just grab some

609
00:37:37,568 --> 00:37:41,909
culture from that culture treasury and apply it to the problem. And all of a

610
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:46,430
sudden, boom, you'd be able to switch governments or slot in a policy. One that

611
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,230
sort of felt weird.

612
00:37:47,738 --> 00:37:53,420
because accumulations of culture sitting around for thousands of years waiting to be spent,

613
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,802
that doesn't make much sense in the real world. And then the other thing that was happening

614
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:02,983
was we were having problems where you'd spend all your culture, get your government set up

615
00:38:03,003 --> 00:38:06,764
right, and then something would happen in the game world. We were tying everything to the

616
00:38:06,804 --> 00:38:11,886
game world and something would happen and it would be the situation where, oh, wow, I just

617
00:38:11,946 --> 00:38:16,327
unlocked this new government. Oh, I don't have any culture left to switch into it.

618
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:23,142
And so even though it would seem like the right time to make one of these cultural shifts, you

619
00:38:23,162 --> 00:38:29,506
couldn't do it with this spending down from your culture of treasury that we had going. So we

620
00:38:29,566 --> 00:38:38,592
finally kind of took the big step in the right direction with Civic System version 4. And this

621
00:38:38,632 --> 00:38:39,332
was something where...

622
00:38:41,299 --> 00:38:46,544
We finally went ahead and created the parallel civics tree that anyone who's played Civ 6 has

623
00:38:46,604 --> 00:38:52,269
seen. This is an idea that had been kicking around. We had talked about doing this probably

624
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:58,355
for a full year before we actually switched over to it. And we were wrapped around the idea

625
00:38:58,415 --> 00:39:02,879
that, oh, civics has to be done different than technology. It has to be something that feels

626
00:39:02,939 --> 00:39:05,582
more cultural. It can't feel like technology.

627
00:39:06,501 --> 00:39:10,906
But if you look at the technology tree, that sort of is a gaming construct put on top of

628
00:39:10,967 --> 00:39:17,454
science and that gaming construct works actually very, very well for us here because now...

629
00:39:18,113 --> 00:39:23,916
You don't have to have individual unlocks for each policy. You can have the policies unlocked in a

630
00:39:23,976 --> 00:39:29,998
bundle when you finish one of these civic nodes that are the equivalent of technology nodes. We

631
00:39:30,018 --> 00:39:34,160
can associate boosts with the whole civic. And so those little unlocks that we had that were

632
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,002
from doing things out in the game world, now those could, we wouldn't have to have as many of

633
00:39:39,022 --> 00:39:39,722
them, maybe, you know.

634
00:39:40,222 --> 00:39:43,044
a third to a quarter as many of them, but we could still have

635
00:39:43,084 --> 00:39:47,467
that type of system. So in general, as soon as we finally

636
00:39:47,487 --> 00:39:50,129
made the switch over to the civics system, things started to

637
00:39:50,169 --> 00:39:53,772
fall into place. Now this particular civics tree, which is

638
00:39:53,812 --> 00:39:58,556
the very first civics tree we tried, did have some problems.

639
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:05,421
If you look at it, the pink nodes, again this is apologies

640
00:40:05,461 --> 00:40:08,523
for my Vizio art skills, because they're just Vizio art.

641
00:40:09,028 --> 00:40:12,229
But the pink ones are required, the white ones are optional.

642
00:40:12,749 --> 00:40:15,130
And you can see, you can just blow through the ancient age

643
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:15,670
pretty quickly.

644
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:18,211
There are only three nodes in the whole ancient area civics

645
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,411
tree that you have to go for.

646
00:40:20,492 --> 00:40:24,933
We also had governments all out on their individual nodes.

647
00:40:25,053 --> 00:40:26,993
So you can sort of pick and choose from those.

648
00:40:27,073 --> 00:40:29,454
And so you ended up skipping a lot of the classical tree too.

649
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,635
And in general, there wasn't much decision making to your

650
00:40:33,655 --> 00:40:35,055
path on this tree.

651
00:40:35,596 --> 00:40:36,976
There was pretty much one path.

652
00:40:37,356 --> 00:40:39,917
to follow, you know, with maybe a few choices.

653
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:44,580
But we need to make this tree richer and deeper and more varied.

654
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,202
So that's sort of how we ended up with our final civics tree.

655
00:40:49,385 --> 00:40:53,147
is we went ahead and created something that looks like the

656
00:40:53,187 --> 00:40:57,669
tech tree. And it was really fun. This was one of the fun

657
00:40:57,729 --> 00:41:02,631
exercises of Civ 6, was trying to reimagine all the improvements

658
00:41:02,691 --> 00:41:05,332
that societies and governments and cultures have made through

659
00:41:05,352 --> 00:41:08,194
the year and what those look like in terms of how they

660
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:12,636
interrelate to each other, which ones lead into other ones. And

661
00:41:12,736 --> 00:41:16,898
so we ended up with a tree like this. This is showing it later

662
00:41:16,918 --> 00:41:17,378
in the game.

663
00:41:18,347 --> 00:41:26,733
and the government screen here where we finally came up with that time where you finish research

664
00:41:26,993 --> 00:41:28,995
on a new civic.

665
00:41:29,095 --> 00:41:31,977
And actually, we never called it researching a civic.

666
00:41:32,017 --> 00:41:34,199
We felt like that was the wrong term.

667
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:35,860
You only research technologies.

668
00:41:36,601 --> 00:41:45,648
So internal to the team, we came up with this term that you research technologies, but you

669
00:41:45,808 --> 00:41:47,529
cultivate civics.

670
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:52,502
And so you'll actually, if you dive deeply enough into the XML

671
00:41:52,522 --> 00:41:54,163
and the files, you'll see all these references to

672
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:54,884
cultivating.

673
00:41:56,085 --> 00:41:57,086
That was our favorite term.

674
00:41:57,867 --> 00:42:00,649
We ended up almost shipping the game and telling people that

675
00:42:00,669 --> 00:42:03,672
they were cultivating, even though that's not a real word.

676
00:42:04,072 --> 00:42:07,075
And it only makes sense in this very, very specific context.

677
00:42:07,115 --> 00:42:09,817
But if you guys want to start using cultivating, I totally

678
00:42:09,857 --> 00:42:10,378
approve of it.

679
00:42:10,918 --> 00:42:13,260
It's one of my favorite words of the last three or four

680
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,442
years, so go for it.

681
00:42:18,095 --> 00:42:22,497
Okay, so two more problems to go through and then we can get on to questions.

682
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:29,540
And this is, these last two are areas where probably Civ 5 took a lot of heat.

683
00:42:31,141 --> 00:42:32,161
And some of it was deserved.

684
00:42:33,042 --> 00:42:38,063
And some of it we agreed with, so that's why it made it onto our list of top five problems with

685
00:42:38,103 --> 00:42:44,226
Su-5. And that's the one unit per tile system. I absolutely loved it. It brought tactical

686
00:42:44,266 --> 00:42:48,587
nuance to the game, but it also brought some problems. So let's look at the biggest one of

687
00:42:48,627 --> 00:42:53,289
those, which was unit congestion. And so if you look at this particular screenshot,

688
00:42:54,639 --> 00:43:00,545
Right here I'm pointing to a mobile surface-to-air missile unit and really its main purpose in the game

689
00:43:00,565 --> 00:43:04,389
It can defend so you can sort of use it as a defensive troop if you need to

690
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:08,213
But it's pretty much its main purpose in the game is to shoot down aircraft

691
00:43:09,149 --> 00:43:13,730
but in this particular configuration, it's sitting there occupying one of the key tiles that

692
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:20,731
the Aztec army needs to approach Katmandu and to capture that city. So it's in the way, it's

693
00:43:20,771 --> 00:43:29,132
blocking things, and that's just part of, you know, kind of the repeat problem that we kept

694
00:43:29,172 --> 00:43:33,773
seeing in Civ 5 games was that people were having their units fall on top of each other,

695
00:43:33,813 --> 00:43:37,174
you know, stumbling upon themselves, and they couldn't get a clear path to what they were

696
00:43:37,194 --> 00:43:38,554
trying to get to with their military.

697
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:44,707
You also notice on this map that it's a cool looking map. It's got a lot of interest.

698
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:48,852
Kathmandu is in this really strategic position right where all these peninsulas come together.

699
00:43:49,873 --> 00:43:54,038
But those strategic positions right where the peninsulas come together are also the worst

700
00:43:54,118 --> 00:43:59,104
places for unit congestion. So in this kind of situation where you're trying to attack it, it

701
00:43:59,164 --> 00:44:00,406
actually becomes pretty frustrating.

702
00:44:01,897 --> 00:44:06,941
So we wanted to look at that and, um, that was, um, something

703
00:44:07,322 --> 00:44:12,426
that wasn't too tricky to solve as long as we just, you know,

704
00:44:12,446 --> 00:44:14,988
sort of attacked that problem directly from a design point of

705
00:44:15,008 --> 00:44:18,872
view. So we added three different things, um, skip

706
00:44:18,892 --> 00:44:27,099
ahead to the next slide, and, uh, go back to, yeah. Um, so,

707
00:44:28,073 --> 00:44:33,775
we had three things. We had support units, so now all those mobile surface-to-air missiles,

708
00:44:34,316 --> 00:44:39,778
anything that is not a front-line fighting unit but you want to have in your army was going to

709
00:44:39,818 --> 00:44:43,899
be something that could be stacked with other units and that was going to help with the

710
00:44:43,959 --> 00:44:53,182
unit congestion and it was also going to be able to move as a grouped unit with your other

711
00:44:53,202 --> 00:44:53,863
military units.

712
00:44:54,675 --> 00:44:59,421
And then the other thing that we did was we allowed you to group

713
00:44:59,702 --> 00:45:03,447
units of the same type together into corps and armies. That was

714
00:45:03,507 --> 00:45:06,892
immediately going to reduce in that one localized area the

715
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,315
amount of map congestion we had by a factor of two or three.

716
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:14,976
But we were very deliberate about that decision. We didn't want to go back to the mixed stacks

717
00:45:15,016 --> 00:45:22,062
that Civ 4 had because then you started losing the clarity as to, you know, is he sending his

718
00:45:22,222 --> 00:45:26,386
mounted troops around my flank? Does he have his melee units up in the front that are

719
00:45:26,446 --> 00:45:31,090
guarding range units behind them? So we wanted to be very careful to maintain that sort of

720
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:36,655
tactical rock, paper, scissors nuance to what was happening on the battlefield. But we

721
00:45:36,695 --> 00:45:37,215
wanted to...

722
00:45:37,675 --> 00:45:49,806
collapse units together and let them occupy the same tiles. So, uh, you can see, um, that not

723
00:45:49,866 --> 00:45:56,412
only do we have, um, the helicopter army here, but we also have, um, the, uh, the, uh, the

724
00:45:58,627 --> 00:46:02,468
naval units that are grouped into corps and armies. We just happen to call them fleets and armadas.

725
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,929
So in general this definitely helped with the

726
00:46:05,989 --> 00:46:07,329
over-stacking problem and

727
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:12,611
we felt like we were able to kind of bring things out in the map

728
00:46:13,711 --> 00:46:19,372
and we're allowed to have those kind of cool choke points like I was showing on that progression up to Kathmandu

729
00:46:20,192 --> 00:46:21,593
and it was going to be okay in our game.

730
00:46:23,792 --> 00:46:26,854
OK, and now I'm getting to the fifth item.

731
00:46:27,935 --> 00:46:31,037
And this problem is something that probably is,

732
00:46:32,078 --> 00:46:33,079
the solution we came up with here

733
00:46:33,139 --> 00:46:35,260
is probably the most controversial of the solutions.

734
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:39,223
We've had members, even internal to our development team,

735
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:42,425
that were telling us just a couple of months

736
00:46:42,465 --> 00:46:44,947
before we were shipping that we were making a huge mistake

737
00:46:45,107 --> 00:46:47,069
with the decision that we made for Civ 6 here,

738
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:50,091
because it was going to confuse too many players

739
00:46:50,151 --> 00:46:50,932
and we shouldn't do it.

740
00:46:52,053 --> 00:46:53,173
But if you think about what

741
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:59,429
I've been emphasizing here is I wanted to make sure that the map was important in your

742
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,669
games of Civilization VI.

743
00:47:00,729 --> 00:47:04,770
I wanted to make sure that the use of all the tiles around your city was important.

744
00:47:05,311 --> 00:47:10,752
I wanted to make sure that you had to think about where you were in the world in terms

745
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:14,273
of which technology boosts and civic boosts you could unlock.

746
00:47:14,913 --> 00:47:17,414
Maybe you don't have stone nearby you.

747
00:47:17,454 --> 00:47:19,995
You cannot go into masonry as early and get the pyramids.

748
00:47:20,075 --> 00:47:20,675
If that's your...

749
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:26,172
big plan to how to get ahead in the ancient era and there's no stone or there's no desert

750
00:47:26,212 --> 00:47:29,754
nearby, you can't actually get the pyramids in this game. So we had done these things

751
00:47:30,255 --> 00:47:34,818
through the unstacking the cities, through the tech boost system that were really helping

752
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:41,262
us bring the map out to sort of, you know, a preeminent role in Civilization VI.

753
00:47:42,085 --> 00:47:46,328
And what we didn't want to do was let people kind of get away

754
00:47:46,448 --> 00:47:48,709
from understanding the map and appreciating the map and

755
00:47:48,789 --> 00:47:50,149
realizing the importance of the map.

756
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,591
And so there was this thing that had happened in all

757
00:47:53,651 --> 00:47:56,713
civilization games with movement rules that I called

758
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:57,613
cheating the terrain.

759
00:47:58,394 --> 00:48:02,136
And the problem there, if you look at this screenshot right

760
00:48:02,176 --> 00:48:06,138
here, you'll see that we have a Indonesian

761
00:48:06,178 --> 00:48:07,558
Chris Swordsman in Civ 5.

762
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:09,760
He's only got one movement point left because

763
00:48:10,302 --> 00:48:15,204
He's already moved into this clear terrain space that he occupies right now.

764
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:20,466
But despite the fact that he only has one movement point left and should not be able

765
00:48:20,586 --> 00:48:25,908
to get anywhere except for another clear terrain space, according to the rules of Civ V,

766
00:48:27,425 --> 00:48:28,046
Doesn't really matter.

767
00:48:28,466 --> 00:48:29,546
He can just dive in there.

768
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:33,967
He can go into either the desert hills that

769
00:48:34,007 --> 00:48:35,288
are highlighted with the blue circle,

770
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:37,048
or into the woods to the west.

771
00:48:38,309 --> 00:48:43,150
And that actually led to this really sort of awkward movement.

772
00:48:44,471 --> 00:48:47,774
in CIV 5 where what you want to do with your guys is always end

773
00:48:47,874 --> 00:48:50,637
their turn in difficult terrain. Because then they have better

774
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:54,701
defensive bonuses. And you can do things like you can scoot

775
00:48:54,741 --> 00:48:58,765
down a valley where the terrain is nice and clear.

776
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:04,455
and then on your final movement jump up onto the wooded hill and see way off into the

777
00:49:04,495 --> 00:49:07,698
distance as you're scouting the terrain. So especially when you're scouting the map and

778
00:49:07,718 --> 00:49:11,041
especially when you're worrying about defending, you always want your last move to be in this

779
00:49:11,101 --> 00:49:16,807
impossibly difficult terrain that should cost a lot of movement points. And it was fighting

780
00:49:16,907 --> 00:49:22,753
against people's appreciation of the map. So what I wanted to do for Civ 6 was change that.

781
00:49:23,896 --> 00:49:29,098
And one thing that I noticed about Civ 5, before we leave Civ

782
00:49:29,718 --> 00:49:33,499
5, is in order to get this blue movement skirt around the unit

783
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:38,400
that highlights the places you can go, you had to know to click

784
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,981
on the special move mode button. And only if you turned on the

785
00:49:42,021 --> 00:49:45,382
move mode would you get the ability to see the valid hexes

786
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:47,583
your unit can move to. Otherwise, you would just right

787
00:49:47,643 --> 00:49:49,103
click and just move there.

788
00:49:50,068 --> 00:49:54,350
So we got to Civ 6 and I proposed we're going to have new movement rules. They're going to

789
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:59,632
actually enforce the proper movement point cost for terrain and you're going to have to pay

790
00:49:59,672 --> 00:50:07,854
that much to go in there. And I put it in and everybody hated it. They just felt like I don't

791
00:50:07,894 --> 00:50:11,715
know why my guy only, you know, he's got one movement point left, I want to be able to do

792
00:50:11,775 --> 00:50:17,017
something with it. It just was confusing players, the turns weren't ending right.

793
00:50:17,956 --> 00:50:21,900
I got a whole bunch of flack from the team internally and if I struggled with the civic

794
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,422
system getting that right, this was one where I was just actually getting people coming

795
00:50:25,483 --> 00:50:28,845
in telling me that I was absolutely taking the franchise in the wrong direction and I

796
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:30,507
needed to change this now.

797
00:50:32,408 --> 00:50:34,569
So I thought about this some more, and I did not want to give

798
00:50:34,629 --> 00:50:37,350
up to it. And luckily, I had two or three other allies in my

799
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:41,371
design office who appreciated why we were making this change,

800
00:50:41,711 --> 00:50:45,112
loved this change, and were really willing to stick it out

801
00:50:45,152 --> 00:50:47,713
with me and work through until we had this working properly.

802
00:50:49,034 --> 00:50:53,155
And so eventually, sort of long story short, what ended up being

803
00:50:53,235 --> 00:50:57,637
the key thing that made me comfortable with the way we were

804
00:50:57,657 --> 00:51:00,738
going to proceed here was I started thinking about Firaxis's

805
00:51:00,778 --> 00:51:01,938
sister game, XCOM.

806
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:04,860
I started thinking about movement in XCOM.

807
00:51:05,581 --> 00:51:08,042
And there's a lot of complicated moves you make in XCOM.

808
00:51:08,082 --> 00:51:09,664
I don't know how many of you guys play XCOM,

809
00:51:09,704 --> 00:51:12,606
but you go up and down ladders, you jump off buildings,

810
00:51:12,626 --> 00:51:15,168
you, you know, there are like multiple levels,

811
00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:18,911
there's different types of terrain you have to go around.

812
00:51:19,531 --> 00:51:21,693
And I don't understand, I play XCOM all the time.

813
00:51:21,733 --> 00:51:22,493
I love XCOM.

814
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:24,795
It's what I do sort of when I get a break from Civ.

815
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:26,336
I go off and play XCOM for a while,

816
00:51:26,356 --> 00:51:27,617
because it's a different strategy game

817
00:51:27,657 --> 00:51:29,078
that's got very, very different rules.

818
00:51:29,927 --> 00:51:32,330
But I have no idea how the XCOM movement system works.

819
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:36,293
I have no idea how you spend points for that,

820
00:51:36,374 --> 00:51:37,495
what your range is.

821
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,256
And I don't need to know as a player

822
00:51:39,356 --> 00:51:41,118
because when I have a unit selected,

823
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:43,480
it just shows me a blue movement boundary

824
00:51:43,541 --> 00:51:44,481
for everywhere I can go,

825
00:51:44,582 --> 00:51:46,724
and I just click on one of the hexes in that area.

826
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:48,906
And all of a sudden, that just works.

827
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,848
That's my move for that guy for that turn.

828
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:56,770
I don't need to know the specifics of how much everything costs. And so what we did is we took

829
00:51:56,810 --> 00:52:01,731
that blue boundary that you saw in Civ 5 was only available when you went in that special

830
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:07,332
movement mode, and we made it always a part of how you made a move in Civ 6. As soon as the

831
00:52:07,392 --> 00:52:11,092
unit's selected, that boundary's going to show, and you know where all the valid tiles are.

832
00:52:11,152 --> 00:52:14,573
And when you're in this situation, like shown on the screenshot here, where you only have one

833
00:52:14,613 --> 00:52:19,314
movement point left, the boundary will shrink down to just where he can go sort of for the

834
00:52:19,354 --> 00:52:20,314
second part of his move.

835
00:52:20,914 --> 00:52:23,957
So we put that in and all of a sudden our user tests were

836
00:52:23,997 --> 00:52:27,740
coming back, people understood it, they got it, things were

837
00:52:28,541 --> 00:52:31,804
looking like we could actually ship the game and have this

838
00:52:31,844 --> 00:52:35,447
system in place, people were going to be able to have the

839
00:52:35,467 --> 00:52:37,269
proper appreciation of the map that I wanted.

840
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:40,211
So let's see where that leaves us.

841
00:52:42,213 --> 00:52:42,413
So.

842
00:52:43,459 --> 00:52:46,361
I'm listing four different things here on the left side of

843
00:52:46,401 --> 00:52:50,664
the screen. Pretty much the four major problem areas that

844
00:52:50,684 --> 00:52:53,206
we've identified from Civ 5, where we've sort of taken a

845
00:52:53,246 --> 00:52:55,748
hard look at ourselves and kind of been real critical to figure

846
00:52:55,788 --> 00:52:58,730
out what we need to change for Civ 6. The only one that's not

847
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:01,892
listed there is the civic system, which is not really

848
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:06,475
necessarily directly part of map driven play, but it does

849
00:53:06,556 --> 00:53:07,496
respond to that.

850
00:53:09,057 --> 00:53:13,501
overarching goal I had about having to think on your feet and not having a single path

851
00:53:14,002 --> 00:53:18,505
through the game, because the civic system lets you reconfigure what you're doing with

852
00:53:18,525 --> 00:53:25,331
your empire and sort of launch yourself into a new phase of the game that's going to be

853
00:53:25,371 --> 00:53:29,695
aligned with your new short-term goal. But if you look at these four things here, I think

854
00:53:30,015 --> 00:53:32,477
in all four of these areas, we really...

855
00:53:33,645 --> 00:53:40,489
decided that the best way for us to hit this primary goal of making it so that you're going

856
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:42,750
to have to think on your feet more and have a more

857
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:47,492
you know, customized experience each time you play, because you're going to have to

858
00:53:48,112 --> 00:53:53,856
redo your strategy. All four of these items contributed to it, and they all brought it

859
00:53:53,956 --> 00:53:59,759
out through driving the play through the map. So one of the things I love about what we

860
00:53:59,779 --> 00:54:05,563
did with Civ VI is not only was the map important to the gameplay, but we sort of followed that

861
00:54:05,963 --> 00:54:12,007
mapping motif with our artwork. So you can see here, not only does the fog of war look

862
00:54:12,067 --> 00:54:12,988
like an ancient map.

863
00:54:14,422 --> 00:54:16,164
It was sort of that old parchmenty look, but we

864
00:54:16,244 --> 00:54:18,446
actually, it's not shown on this screenshot, but we

865
00:54:18,486 --> 00:54:21,609
actually themed the user interface, the heads up

866
00:54:21,649 --> 00:54:24,632
display has sort of a age of exploration

867
00:54:24,653 --> 00:54:25,493
theme to it as well.

868
00:54:27,235 --> 00:54:29,478
So that's kind of what I wanted to go over today.

869
00:54:30,018 --> 00:54:31,800
I think because we have a little bit of extra time, I

870
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,443
can still take at least 10 minutes of questions.

871
00:54:35,244 --> 00:54:36,645
And I thank you for coming out to the talk.

872
00:54:45,136 --> 00:54:59,767
Hi, thank you. I really want to sneak two questions in, but I was here with Sid and I asked him, like my favorite part of the franchise is the Civ I, the end of game, replay, really tied together like this accomplishment over 30 hours and I was wondering why that disappeared.

873
00:55:00,187 --> 00:55:09,453
Yep, and I was here for that session. Sid apologized that he had thrown me under the bus because he had not answered your question, but I'm happy to answer that question.

874
00:55:11,773 --> 00:55:15,216
I'm not sure whether I'm going to do a talk like this

875
00:55:15,616 --> 00:55:17,258
in the couple years at GDC.

876
00:55:17,778 --> 00:55:20,080
But one thing that has been clear to me

877
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,761
as we've been working on Civilization VI

878
00:55:21,981 --> 00:55:24,063
is that the process of rolling out

879
00:55:24,123 --> 00:55:25,964
a new title in the Civilization franchise,

880
00:55:27,746 --> 00:55:30,508
it's a five, six year proposition.

881
00:55:31,549 --> 00:55:33,270
And we have to make a lot of decisions

882
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:38,014
about where everything is going to hit during that rollout

883
00:55:39,195 --> 00:55:40,255
and what's...

884
00:55:41,223 --> 00:55:46,344
the right things for the base game and which things, you know, maybe we have plans down

885
00:55:46,365 --> 00:55:52,706
the road in the future to really do a great job with and so some of the support that might

886
00:55:52,746 --> 00:56:00,547
be expected will come down the road. So I just ask you to be patient because we actually,

887
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:04,748
it may look like we don't care about replay systems at all, but it's actually something

888
00:56:04,788 --> 00:56:06,949
that is still very forefront in our thinking.

889
00:56:09,874 --> 00:56:12,376
So what is the process for iterating on design on a game

890
00:56:12,396 --> 00:56:13,636
that takes 30 hours to play?

891
00:56:16,858 --> 00:56:17,418
It's tricky.

892
00:56:17,879 --> 00:56:22,061
And there are a lot of ways we sort of cheat that.

893
00:56:22,301 --> 00:56:25,783
If you look at the fact that some of the setup options

894
00:56:25,923 --> 00:56:27,804
in the Civilization game, I don't

895
00:56:27,824 --> 00:56:30,386
think our players ever use or use very, very rarely.

896
00:56:30,746 --> 00:56:33,688
But they're instrumental to what the team does in terms of us

897
00:56:33,748 --> 00:56:34,888
being able to iterate on things.

898
00:56:35,189 --> 00:56:37,010
So for instance, we have what we call our advanced starts,

899
00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:39,011
where you can start a game in the Renaissance

900
00:56:39,072 --> 00:56:40,493
or start a game in the industrial era.

901
00:56:41,073 --> 00:56:42,294
We use those all the time.

902
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,636
That's how you can just dive into a part of the tech tree

903
00:56:44,656 --> 00:56:45,476
and see how it's playing.

904
00:56:45,516 --> 00:56:48,118
You can try out air combat without having

905
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:49,860
to play for five hours to get to it.

906
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,602
So there are tricks and techniques

907
00:56:53,663 --> 00:56:55,564
like that that we've sort of adopted over the time.

908
00:56:55,764 --> 00:56:58,406
And some of those are built in as options

909
00:56:58,686 --> 00:57:00,107
that players don't use very often,

910
00:57:00,127 --> 00:57:01,588
but the development team uses quite a bit.

911
00:57:02,469 --> 00:57:02,669
Thank you.

912
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:06,602
Hi, I'm Arthur, I'm working at Amplitude Studio.

913
00:57:07,002 --> 00:57:10,605
We are creating games like Endless Legend for this game.

914
00:57:11,305 --> 00:57:14,347
First of all, congratulations for this amazing sequel.

915
00:57:14,607 --> 00:57:14,788
Thanks.

916
00:57:14,828 --> 00:57:15,088
Really.

917
00:57:15,908 --> 00:57:18,850
So I really like the tech boost system.

918
00:57:19,671 --> 00:57:22,253
But after some games, I just realized

919
00:57:22,293 --> 00:57:26,196
that even me, who are not really an optimizer player,

920
00:57:26,796 --> 00:57:27,637
I was starting to.

921
00:57:29,322 --> 00:57:35,626
trying to achieve all the conditions to have all the boosts and at the end I just you know

922
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:40,930
have all these units that I don't really want and this improvement in my city that I don't

923
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:45,593
really chose. And I don't know if you thought about that and maybe thought about a more

924
00:57:45,653 --> 00:57:47,935
random system for this boost.

925
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:55,554
Civ 6 can be a bit of a frustrating experience for somebody who wants to try to achieve sort

926
00:57:55,594 --> 00:57:58,216
of that perfect game and optimize everything.

927
00:57:59,457 --> 00:58:05,161
There's a lot of things that we deliberately put in your way to make it so you can't have

928
00:58:05,201 --> 00:58:06,041
the perfect setup.

929
00:58:06,402 --> 00:58:08,143
So you can't get all the wonders.

930
00:58:08,763 --> 00:58:13,046
You have to make trade-offs about how you're going to use the tiles outside your city.

931
00:58:13,086 --> 00:58:17,169
Sometimes it's the science campus tile.

932
00:58:18,316 --> 00:58:23,738
up against the mountains that you want to use for that gets

933
00:58:24,198 --> 00:58:27,279
pilfered to put in your holy site or a wonder that

934
00:58:27,319 --> 00:58:28,599
has a specific requirement.

935
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:34,441
So yeah, I realize that we sort of made the choice

936
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:39,623
to force people away from having a perfect layout

937
00:58:39,663 --> 00:58:40,403
and a perfect plan.

938
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:44,647
But if you look at what I was going for here in terms of

939
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,550
trying to make people have to adjust and not be able to rely

940
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:51,233
on the same strategy every time, I think that you end up

941
00:58:51,253 --> 00:58:52,074
there no matter what.

942
00:58:55,072 --> 00:59:00,235
Um, so, I actually was going to come up and say that I really hated the movement system, but you

943
00:59:00,275 --> 00:59:04,057
apparently went over that right at the end of the talk. Uh, yeah, even yesterday in my

944
00:59:04,097 --> 00:59:09,339
playthrough I was trying to go into a forest and my dude stopped and then I lost the city and I

945
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,401
was like, you movement system! Um...

946
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:18,144
But actually, my question to you is slightly less game mechanic based and more about the

947
00:59:18,164 --> 00:59:23,286
Civilopedia. So in Civ V, Civ VI, you guys introduced religion and did a lot more things.

948
00:59:24,066 --> 00:59:28,208
And one of my favorite parts of Civ has always been the Civilopedia because it's text that

949
00:59:28,328 --> 00:59:31,390
we've actually learned from over the years. And I feel that

950
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:38,432
in Civ 6, a lot of the Civilpedia entries and a lot of the tech research entries that you get,

951
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:44,373
the quotes that come up, they seem a lot more snarky, snide, almost kind of mocking the

952
00:59:44,393 --> 00:59:49,514
thing that you either discovered or are trying to research. It seems a little bit more hurtful,

953
00:59:49,574 --> 00:59:54,195
I guess, than you would expect from a Civ game. And I was just concerned with, I guess,

954
00:59:55,795 --> 00:59:58,476
wondering what the designs behind that were.

955
00:59:58,959 --> 01:00:02,981
Yeah, we've gotten that feedback before. It's certainly not the first time I've heard that.

956
01:00:03,061 --> 01:00:08,604
And if you came to Sid's talk, you can see that even in Sid 1, they were wrestling with

957
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:14,087
what's the right balance between sort of respectful, you know, true historical treatment

958
01:00:14,268 --> 01:00:20,291
and humor. And there probably are some areas where we missed the bar a little bit on Civ 6.

959
01:00:20,331 --> 01:00:24,834
So we'll definitely learn from that. I don't think we've made a permanent shift in one

960
01:00:24,874 --> 01:00:27,756
direction. I think that's something where...

961
01:00:28,756 --> 01:00:31,479
You try some things out, some things work, some things the

962
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:33,160
community pushes back a little bit.

963
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:37,183
And that's probably an area where we learned a little bit

964
01:00:37,223 --> 01:00:38,705
more about what the community really likes.

965
01:00:39,265 --> 01:00:43,088
Yeah, and also, you guys misspelled Guru Nanak's name in

966
01:00:43,128 --> 01:00:45,330
the civilization entry for Sikhism.

967
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:48,252
And I feel that that's a 10 second Google search, maybe.

968
01:00:48,753 --> 01:00:50,795
You could fix the major important leader.

969
01:00:51,555 --> 01:00:53,296
Well, we'd absolutely love to fix it.

970
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,257
And we do that all the time.

971
01:00:55,317 --> 01:00:58,879
We go back, and if people email us or whatever, tweet me,

972
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:02,621
whatever, we go back in and we patch up everything.

973
01:01:02,641 --> 01:01:04,783
Because we know that people are going

974
01:01:04,803 --> 01:01:08,585
to be playing Civ VI five years, 10 years, hopefully, from now.

975
01:01:08,745 --> 01:01:11,087
And so we might as well get it right for people

976
01:01:11,207 --> 01:01:12,087
all the way down the road.

977
01:01:12,487 --> 01:01:13,748
So send those on to us.

978
01:01:14,188 --> 01:01:15,889
There's a lot of text in this game.

979
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:18,431
It gets localized into over 13 languages.

980
01:01:19,432 --> 01:01:20,352
Things like that do happen.

981
01:01:22,582 --> 01:01:24,162
Hi, how are you?

982
01:01:24,963 --> 01:01:28,645
So I've played all the Civ series from one through six,

983
01:01:28,845 --> 01:01:35,409
and I want to congratulate you that Civ VI really feels very

984
01:01:35,449 --> 01:01:36,329
much part of the series.

985
01:01:36,529 --> 01:01:38,870
And it's actually a very good game in the series.

986
01:01:39,271 --> 01:01:40,551
So I've been very impressed by it.

987
01:01:40,591 --> 01:01:41,192
Thank you so much.

988
01:01:41,432 --> 01:01:41,632
Thanks.

989
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:47,916
Before I get to my question, like in the earlier presentation I did bring up a question about

990
01:01:47,936 --> 01:01:53,619
what you just said, but I wanted to bring it back again to social responsibility as

991
01:01:53,659 --> 01:01:54,340
a game developer.

992
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:59,723
As an industry as a whole, I think we want to be moving towards more of that and I think

993
01:01:59,843 --> 01:02:01,244
you know, for access.

994
01:02:02,105 --> 01:02:06,651
play like this game really can play a big role in that and I would like to see a bit more on the

995
01:02:06,711 --> 01:02:11,997
educational aspects to be highlighted and kind of in the tune of the sociopedia question as well

996
01:02:13,038 --> 01:02:16,623
I think we're losing a bit of that and especially at this day and age it's important to bring

997
01:02:17,003 --> 01:02:19,066
more of that back so I'd encourage more of that.

998
01:02:20,367 --> 01:02:25,572
My question is how you guys understand what users are doing with the game.

999
01:02:25,912 --> 01:02:29,456
So I heard a lot from you about listening to the community via the forums,

1000
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:36,563
but how much are you also looking at actual usage of the game and analytics in terms of how people are actually playing the game

1001
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:39,365
and how do you balance that with what people are demanding on the forums?

1002
01:02:40,283 --> 01:02:47,426
Okay, and I just remembered I'm supposed to be repeating the questions for the forum vault video for this, so I'll start that right now.

1003
01:02:47,686 --> 01:02:55,328
The question was, how do we use analytics and look not only at what the community is saying, but actually some raw data from how the game is being played?

1004
01:02:56,109 --> 01:03:03,654
to inform our decisions going forward. So we are definitely looking at that. We did not have a

1005
01:03:03,694 --> 01:03:08,277
full telemetry system coming back from the game in Civilization 5, but we have put that in for

1006
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:15,321
Civilization 6. So all of a sudden we do start to get aggregate data. We don't ever focus on any

1007
01:03:15,361 --> 01:03:20,324
particular user, but we get aggregate data for how often certain tech boosts get triggered.

1008
01:03:21,765 --> 01:03:25,987
which civilizations people are playing, which types of

1009
01:03:26,027 --> 01:03:26,987
victory are they going for.

1010
01:03:28,168 --> 01:03:31,069
And it's actually, I know that's a new trend in games,

1011
01:03:31,149 --> 01:03:32,589
is to get that kind of telemetry in there.

1012
01:03:32,669 --> 01:03:35,390
But it's already very, very clear to us that this is a

1013
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:38,351
huge new tool that's going to help us going forward.

1014
01:03:38,391 --> 01:03:42,453
And it should make us able to tune and really get Civ VI to

1015
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:47,114
the best possible place without having to make as many

1016
01:03:47,154 --> 01:03:48,875
guesses as we had to make in the past.

1017
01:03:49,435 --> 01:03:49,615
So.

1018
01:03:50,516 --> 01:03:53,597
It's a great question and it's definitely something that we're focused on.

1019
01:03:53,617 --> 01:03:57,019
We also run a whole series of focus tests before the game ships.

1020
01:03:57,140 --> 01:04:00,682
That's another great source of data about how people are playing the game and what they're

1021
01:04:00,702 --> 01:04:01,302
struggling with.

1022
01:04:02,403 --> 01:04:08,566
So yeah, I'm noticing that it's sort of a whole new world in terms of having that kind

1023
01:04:08,606 --> 01:04:10,808
of supporting data to really influence your decisions.

1024
01:04:10,868 --> 01:04:16,511
Some of what I showed you here was, you know, designer instinct and maybe not necessarily

1025
01:04:16,831 --> 01:04:18,512
based on data.

1026
01:04:20,107 --> 01:04:21,948
But I think you need a combination of the two

1027
01:04:22,028 --> 01:04:23,969
to really move forward in the best possible way.

1028
01:04:24,909 --> 01:04:25,229
Thank you.

1029
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:32,672
OK.

1030
01:04:33,372 --> 01:04:35,893
All right, so let me take one more, or should we end it now?

1031
01:04:36,333 --> 01:04:36,593
OK.

1032
01:04:36,853 --> 01:04:38,033
All right, that's it for questions,

1033
01:04:38,053 --> 01:04:40,274
but I will still be up front, and I'll

1034
01:04:40,314 --> 01:04:41,334
take your questions personally.

1035
01:04:42,655 --> 01:04:42,875
OK.

1036
01:04:43,555 --> 01:04:43,875
Thank you.
