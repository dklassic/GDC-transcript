00:00:07,546 --> 00:00:19,956
Good morning, everyone. Before we are good afternoon, I suppose, depending on your time zone, before we get things started here, just a quick reminder to pay attention to GDC's code of conduct with all of your chat exchanges this morning.

2
00:00:20,317 --> 00:00:23,639
Just be nice, be thoughtful, not too difficult, easy stuff.

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,663
So our speaker today is the prolific game composer, Winifred Phillips.

4
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:33,528
You might recognize her work for franchises like Assassin's Creed, God of War, Little Big Planet, Total War and The Sims.

5
00:00:34,525 --> 00:00:35,925
We'll get started here just in a second.

6
00:00:36,426 --> 00:00:39,747
So as we do, please feel free to drop any questions you may have about the creative

7
00:00:39,787 --> 00:00:45,449
or technical challenges of game music composition or Winifred's own past work you may have in

8
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:47,270
that questions tab in your chat window there.

9
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:51,371
And we'll ask however many we have time for and get into talking about those.

10
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:53,632
So with that, Winifred, you ready to get started here?

11
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,192
I'm looking forward to it. Hello GDC summer. This is going to be fun.

12
00:00:58,613 --> 00:01:04,577
Yeah, it's a cool experience so far and I like the, I don't know, the nice little one-on-one AMAs are really sweet.

13
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:08,600
So I guess we'll just jump into it here and then we'll pull some questions from chat.

14
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,222
How does game composition differ from other areas of music composition?

15
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:21,924
Oh gosh, great question. Game composition is kind of like a really different philosophy,

16
00:01:21,984 --> 00:01:27,406
just at the core of it. I mean, when you're composing for a film, it's a linear experience.

17
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:29,006
It's all pre-planned. It's...

18
00:01:29,387 --> 00:01:33,869
It's got a beginning, a middle, and an end. You're sort of composing to the dramatic beats on the

19
00:01:33,929 --> 00:01:41,093
screen, but it's a very preordained kind of thing. When you're composing for a game, it's a fluid

20
00:01:41,153 --> 00:01:45,456
experience. Everything depends upon the actions of the player, so you really don't know what's

21
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:46,976
going to happen at any given time.

22
00:01:47,477 --> 00:01:54,882
And with that, you have to construct the music in kind of a modular way. It has to be put together

23
00:01:55,183 --> 00:02:00,366
in components that can be sort of assembled and disassembled based on what's going on,

24
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:05,851
what the player's doing, and what activities they're involved in. The game engine has to

25
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:09,453
essentially be able to take the music apart and then put it back together in different ways.

26
00:02:09,674 --> 00:02:11,615
And that's just really interesting.

27
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:17,259
Because as a composer, it means I'm not thinking about beginnings and middles and ends. I'm thinking

28
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:26,707
about states of being, of activity, of thought, of action, of ways to feel in any particular moment.

29
00:02:26,787 --> 00:02:33,992
And you express that musically and then you create a whole assortment, a kind of a hodgepodge

30
00:02:34,352 --> 00:02:39,436
of those kinds of statements, those kind of musical statements that can be then

31
00:02:39,817 --> 00:02:44,939
sort of assembled into its own vocabulary, its own kind of peculiar grammar. It's really

32
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:50,062
interesting work. A whole complicated beast because like I guess with most, I don't know,

33
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:53,383
narrative you have that beginning and middle and your end and that's like your safety blanket,

34
00:02:53,463 --> 00:02:56,045
but not quite having that in music seems a little intimidating.

35
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:02,962
It's true. When I first started, it was really hard to get your head around the idea of creating

36
00:03:03,022 --> 00:03:10,866
music that seems interesting and involved and has a lot to say, and yet doesn't seem to be going

37
00:03:11,127 --> 00:03:17,390
anywhere very aggressively. It isn't giving you signposts that are kind of pointing towards the

38
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,731
direction that you're heading.

39
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:25,612
Because when you do that, when you create big, like, set piece moments within a musical composition,

40
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:31,093
then it really draws attention to itself, especially if the music was designed to loop.

41
00:03:31,673 --> 00:03:34,954
And then you can really feel the repetition happening.

42
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:41,095
And that's a big issue to deal with, just structurally, in terms of music composition for games.

43
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:43,656
You want to make sure that the music feels...

44
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:50,627
Natural, and as if it were being created specifically for the gamer's experience,

45
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:55,050
for what they're doing. You don't really want to give away the magic trick that's going on

46
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:01,555
underneath all the mechanics that are happening. So you have to keep in mind the unique nature

47
00:04:01,836 --> 00:04:08,181
of game music when you're creating it so that it functions really well within the construct

48
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:09,101
of gaming itself.

49
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:16,371
So we're going to kind of segue that into a question from chat here from Sophia in chat.

50
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:20,895
They say hello, and would like to know when you're analyzing or researching a genre for a project.

51
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:26,340
What exactly do you kind of note down and analyze against how do you transfer that research to your music.

52
00:04:27,078 --> 00:04:34,220
Great question. Hello, Sophia. The research process is one of my favorite parts of the work that I do

53
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:38,422
in games and it's great with the video game industry and the kind of projects you work on

54
00:04:38,462 --> 00:04:44,343
because they're so varied and some of them are really larger than life or in the speculative

55
00:04:44,403 --> 00:04:51,485
genres so you get to create epic and expansive stuff that with really intense emotional

56
00:04:51,545 --> 00:04:53,226
undercurrents and that's a lot of fun.

57
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:59,488
And also a lot of it can be influenced by period pieces, some of it's historical, like the work I

58
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:05,249
did on Assassin's Creed Liberation was set in 18th century New Orleans, so you had a lot of

59
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:11,831
cultural influences there. And with that kind of project, first thing I would do is delve into

60
00:05:12,031 --> 00:05:18,733
research for understanding the story. I mean, as a part of the team creating the game, I need to

61
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:22,895
understand the emotional content, the context of the game.

62
00:05:22,895 --> 00:05:25,637
And so I'm trying to figure out how the characters are feeling if I'm going to express that.

63
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:38,806
Just, just as a baseline even apart from what I'm going to do musically I need to understand how everybody's feeling and and what's going on so I tried to do that kind of research and also makes me feel more a part of the team and the project

64
00:05:38,866 --> 00:05:40,948
when I'm on the same page as everybody about.

65
00:05:41,395 --> 00:05:47,559
what we're all trying to say with the project. But then apart from that, I start looking at

66
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:53,923
is there any instrumentation that would be specific to the era, the location? Are there

67
00:05:54,264 --> 00:06:00,148
musical techniques that would have been favored by composers at the time? That kind of thing.

68
00:06:01,048 --> 00:06:04,711
That's really interesting. I did a lot of research on French Baroque.

69
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:09,920
a musical forms for my work on Assassin's Creed Liberation because that was the music that would

70
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:15,922
have been popular at the time that the main character was having her adventures. So it was

71
00:06:15,962 --> 00:06:23,204
important for me to do that. And of course, since she was of African American ancestry, I also tried

72
00:06:23,304 --> 00:06:29,506
very much to understand that cultural influence in her experience, you know, those wonderful

73
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:37,391
Strong primary harmonic colors and the really fantastic rhythms and instrumentation that I had to work with there.

74
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:49,319
So just as an example of the kind of rich source material that you can kind of dive into, Assassin's Creed Liberation was really fantastic for me.

75
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:57,464
That'd be like a really interesting exercise and kind of stretching those research and like your different aspects of composition skills for games like that.

76
00:06:59,092 --> 00:07:02,757
To kind of merge a question from chat with something I'm curious about,

77
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,043
we have a question, have you ever had to make music for a game without seeing

78
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:09,246
what it looks like? If so, what is that process like?

79
00:07:10,247 --> 00:07:10,488
Yeah.

80
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:17,244
Yeah, that actually happens quite a lot, more than you'd think. And I think it has a lot to do with

81
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:23,009
the way in which game development happens. If you're creating music for a film, you tend to be

82
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:28,793
brought in when the film is somewhere near its final cut. You're not really creating music for

83
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:35,458
the film while it's being shot or while it's in preliminary edits. The composer needs to know

84
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:39,381
what the final beats are, how the shots are going to go from one thing to another.

85
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:45,892
But for games, the game tends to be very fluid and in development when I'm brought in.

86
00:07:46,272 --> 00:07:49,293
And sometimes there really isn't even anything playable yet.

87
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:55,495
Or if there is, it's really early character designs with the arms jutting straight out

88
00:07:55,535 --> 00:08:01,177
and just sort of floating over some sort of really abstract looking geometrical grid.

89
00:08:01,237 --> 00:08:05,118
And it gives me no idea of what the game's going to look like or feel like.

90
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:13,245
And you have to be able to sort of cope with that, kind of plumb the depths of your own imagination to kind of fill in those gaps.

91
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:28,458
So that's why research really does help a lot there, because we have to kind of bring our own inner life to the envisioning of what it is we're scoring when we don't have those kinds of visual helpers to guide us along.

92
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:33,770
So kind of in the same vein of that, Christian in chat wants to know,

93
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,072
how do you ensure that sound effects and music really mesh together really well and form a

94
00:08:38,232 --> 00:08:42,995
consistent experience as opposed to just kind of like a random mix that doesn't jar quite well?

95
00:08:43,835 --> 00:08:47,216
Yeah, that's a great question, Christian. And I think

96
00:08:47,647 --> 00:08:53,011
The best way to go about that is to have a really nice working relationship between the composer and

97
00:08:53,051 --> 00:08:56,994
the sound designer, the sound team, the audio director. We're all kind of on the same page

98
00:08:57,014 --> 00:09:02,899
and we're working together. And sometimes it's trial and error. The sound design team may not

99
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,602
actually know what the sound effects are going to be doing when they ask me to compose the music.

100
00:09:07,782 --> 00:09:12,606
I might be ahead of them in terms of the workflow and I deliver music for them and then they

101
00:09:12,646 --> 00:09:14,447
experiment with the sound design and

102
00:09:14,827 --> 00:09:18,810
They come back to me and ask me to kind of tweak things if they're not sort of fitting

103
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:23,373
together properly with the sort of sound design decisions that they're making for the game.

104
00:09:23,893 --> 00:09:27,235
Or on the other hand, sometimes they've just gone ahead and changed what they were doing

105
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,417
to fit the music that I was delivering it.

106
00:09:29,597 --> 00:09:33,219
I think it depends on priorities, on what people are happy with.

107
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,961
It's such a collaborative process.

108
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:41,984
It's just so very fluid and it's about personalities and artistic ambitions.

109
00:09:42,825 --> 00:09:46,847
And everybody's trying very hard to make sure all the elements come together.

110
00:09:46,867 --> 00:09:52,671
It's so a conglomeration of so many different creative strategies.

111
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:57,193
And so I think that's part of what makes game development so exciting.

112
00:09:57,253 --> 00:09:59,795
So many different viewpoints coming together.

113
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:07,314
Just to expand on that, how long is your typical involvement in a project from your very first

114
00:10:08,136 --> 00:10:10,541
plucking at strings to the final composition delivered to them?

115
00:10:10,621 --> 00:10:12,745
How long are you working alongside those developers?

116
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:16,618
Oh, great. That is a great question because it's hard to answer.

117
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:18,899
It really depends on the project.

118
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:24,440
I mean, I've been on indie teams that are really short development schedule.

119
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,641
And I'm kind of in there hitting the ground running, just cranking out the tracks.

120
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:30,261
And it's just maybe a month or so

121
00:10:31,401 --> 00:10:32,982
where I've completed all the work for it.

122
00:10:33,202 --> 00:10:35,622
And on the other end of the spectrum, I've been in projects

123
00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:38,063
that have had me working on and off for years.

124
00:10:40,354 --> 00:10:49,561
While they're developing and they'll come to me and ask me to deliver kind of a cache of tracks for them to incorporate based on where the game is at that time.

125
00:10:49,581 --> 00:10:54,684
And then they'll go off and they'll develop and they'll work on the project and it'll be very fluid.

126
00:10:54,724 --> 00:11:00,308
They'll come back to me and say things like, oh, the game's completely different now, so we need you to revise the music in this way or that way.

127
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:11,183
Or we're thinking about a different style or this level is how now has been removed and we're now doing something different. So we're repurposing music in a different way and we need you to deliver music in a different.

128
00:11:12,114 --> 00:11:17,537
feeling or structured in a different way. The interactive implementation scheme may have changed.

129
00:11:18,318 --> 00:11:25,202
That's very challenging and very interesting work. There are a lot of different pitfalls to it,

130
00:11:25,242 --> 00:11:32,286
but also some really great things can come out of it. It stretches you as a composer, makes you

131
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:41,071
grow and look to yourself to think of different kinds of solutions to problems. That can be a lot

132
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:41,352
of fun.

133
00:11:43,191 --> 00:11:47,055
Another question from chat here from Brian on themes and thematic development.

134
00:11:47,175 --> 00:11:52,779
Any suggestions on incorporating recognizable themes into content without getting samey or redundant through overuse?

135
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,322
Good question. Yeah.

136
00:11:56,621 --> 00:12:03,203
Themes are tricky in video games, particularly with looping content, or content that's going

137
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:09,726
to be repeated a lot. I mean, you can be hundreds of hours playing a game, and there are only a few

138
00:12:09,766 --> 00:12:16,168
games that are actually requisitioning hundreds of hours of music. So there's going to be repetition

139
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:21,730
happening there, and it's a good point that you have to be very aware of that as an aspect of

140
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:25,594
I kind of like to break themes down.

141
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:29,437
I mean, you state them in a very recognizable and dynamic way

142
00:12:30,298 --> 00:12:33,000
when it's important at a set piece moment in the game,

143
00:12:33,081 --> 00:12:36,123
or maybe it's a part of the main theme, or it's a part of a main menu,

144
00:12:36,163 --> 00:12:41,088
and you really want to use it as a way in which you're creating a musical signature for the project.

145
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:49,374
But then you can break it down into fragments like motives, small segments, just a few notes,

146
00:12:49,655 --> 00:12:53,297
something that might not even be consciously recognized as a part of that theme.

147
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,219
And then you can sprinkle it elsewhere.

148
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,303
And it just communicates in a subconscious way to the player.

149
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:05,346
It asserts the game's musical identity without really being overt about it.

150
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:09,489
And you can also use them as figures, ostinatos.

151
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:13,871
You can restructure a theme to be more of an underlying pattern

152
00:13:14,272 --> 00:13:17,234
that other original material might be on top of.

153
00:13:17,574 --> 00:13:22,377
And that's a way to also assert the theme without it being a foreground element.

154
00:13:22,477 --> 00:13:26,139
It's not something that is going to be front of consciousness,

155
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:27,840
but it's still going to be there.

156
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,402
It's going to be asserting an identity.

157
00:13:30,622 --> 00:13:33,404
And I think that's always a great thing to try to strive for,

158
00:13:34,244 --> 00:13:37,305
to sprinkle a sense of identity into everything you're doing.

159
00:13:37,326 --> 00:13:40,887
That kind of builds into a question from Nikki in chat.

160
00:13:41,127 --> 00:13:42,588
Do you have a favorite leaf motif?

161
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:43,949
If so, what is it?

162
00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:45,269
Kind of what's the formula for that?

163
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:46,970
Oh, gosh.

164
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:52,233
In terms of, well, the Assassin's Creed Liberation Score

165
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:55,675
was really strongly driven by leitmotifs.

166
00:13:55,775 --> 00:13:56,675
I had them for,

167
00:13:58,033 --> 00:14:04,316
Nearly every character, every one of the important characters, because there are so many, but all of the main characters had

168
00:14:05,337 --> 00:14:12,980
leitmotifs that returned and I couldn't tell you if there was a favorite leitmotif that I've used for a project.

169
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:21,884
Although I do have to say that I had a lot of fun with the leitmotif, the core leitmotif for Spore Hero for Electronic Arts.

170
00:14:22,664 --> 00:14:26,006
Because that was an opportunity to express it in so many different ways.

171
00:14:26,386 --> 00:14:30,388
Spore Hero was a score that was very influenced by world music.

172
00:14:30,488 --> 00:14:36,051
It's, after all, it's a game about monsters wandering around a primitive world.

173
00:14:36,111 --> 00:14:40,274
And so I really wanted you to feel this sort of friendly world music atmosphere.

174
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:43,515
And I was delving into all different kinds of world music for it.

175
00:14:43,555 --> 00:14:48,378
So taking the core theme, the leitmotif that's first expressed in the main theme,

176
00:14:48,418 --> 00:14:48,878
and then just...

177
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:55,301
Re-expressing it in all of these different cultural, musical styles and influences was

178
00:14:55,501 --> 00:15:00,223
tremendous fun. All kinds of different instruments, all kinds of different rhythmic constructs. And

179
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:06,785
it just, it made it a really fun puzzle for me to see how many different ways you can kind of

180
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:11,827
turn a theme inside out and rediscover it as a composer and see what it can do.

181
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:18,378
Building that into a question from Tim, who says hello and thank you for answering our questions.

182
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:22,142
What is your process to avoid overcomposing a section or scene in game?

183
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,284
Can you share examples of how you've done that in the past?

184
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:46,700
Mm, good point. Yeah, you don't, it's like a fine line. You don't want to do too little, you don't want to do too much. If the music is too aggressive, it can really start to feel aggressively dominant in the experience you're having in the game. And you certainly don't want that. For Assassin's Creed Liberation, I had a four chord

185
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:53,323
Essentially it's a theme, but it's also just a four chord pattern. Very subtle, but it was

186
00:15:53,863 --> 00:15:59,004
something that was incorporated as essentially the central building block of the main theme

187
00:15:59,044 --> 00:16:02,685
of the game. This four chord pattern that repeated over and over and over again.

188
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:09,407
And I was able to use that a lot in the game. And one of the virtues of it was that it was

189
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:11,688
very subtle, very low keyed.

190
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:17,710
Almost subliminal in the sense that you could recognize it when it came back,

191
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:22,372
but it wasn't really anything that would really arrest your attention.

192
00:16:22,952 --> 00:16:29,155
And so it was this stealth music, just functionally speaking, for a stealth game.

193
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:36,677
But functionally speaking, it was a stealthy construct that I could use to create a sense

194
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:40,319
of identity without having to overwrite the piece.

195
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:48,935
in order to use a lot of really dynamic thematic ideas that would arrest the player's attention more aggressively.

196
00:16:50,457 --> 00:16:55,541
So you've talked a little bit already about how you kind of do your research to get into

197
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:59,344
like the period and spirit of the game, but what about genres in that sense?

198
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:03,327
When you're researching for scores that you're not already deeply knowledgeable in the genre,

199
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:07,250
what's your immersion approach and when do you know you're ready to dive into creating

200
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,911
something unique with your new material?

201
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:11,093
And that's a question from Brian, I don't want to steal credit for that one.

202
00:17:11,934 --> 00:17:17,680
Brian, nice question. And that is definitely something that we have to face a lot. I mean,

203
00:17:18,361 --> 00:17:21,845
if you're doing pretty well as a game composer, you're probably going to be

204
00:17:22,405 --> 00:17:28,312
scoring projects from a lot of different kind of game genres. And that can be pretty challenging.

205
00:17:28,372 --> 00:17:31,776
I remember when I was first hired to do the music for Speed Racer,

206
00:17:32,836 --> 00:17:38,399
I had to really look into what the musical scores are like for racing games.

207
00:17:38,499 --> 00:17:42,881
It's very techno-driven music, and that wasn't something I had done up to that point.

208
00:17:43,622 --> 00:17:49,485
So I got a chance to learn something really new and to kind of dive into the electronic sound palette

209
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:51,946
and those really driving rhythms.

210
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:59,437
And that really dominant beat that just helps to accentuate the sense of speed in a racing game.

211
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:01,359
So that was something I got to learn along the way.

212
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,203
On the other hand, it was also tied into the speed racer intellectual property and the

213
00:18:07,623 --> 00:18:14,250
Wachowski's film that had just come out at the time. So it was, it had to have this very eccentric

214
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:20,896
and almost retro feel. And I, so I had this sort of juggle and, and, and merge together two ideas

215
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:28,604
that were really opposite, a very retro inspired orchestral score with this very techno driving

216
00:18:28,684 --> 00:18:31,187
genre that we, that really needed to be.

217
00:18:32,368 --> 00:18:33,869
I had to be true to it.

218
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:38,613
It is a racing game and you don't want to disappoint fans of racing games.

219
00:18:38,713 --> 00:18:42,997
I mean, there's an expectation there and if the musical score is so different

220
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:47,941
that it doesn't seem to have the spirit of the genre running through it,

221
00:18:48,422 --> 00:18:52,145
then it can start to feel like the music's sitting on top of the game

222
00:18:52,425 --> 00:18:54,507
and not really woven into it.

223
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:57,549
And I didn't want that to happen with Speed Racer.

224
00:18:58,283 --> 00:19:05,348
I ended up with this really eccentric amalgamation of styles and influences, and it was a lot

225
00:19:05,388 --> 00:19:05,768
of fun.

226
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:07,990
I had a really good time working on that one.

227
00:19:10,271 --> 00:19:15,915
To branch into some more day-to-day operations, we've got a couple questions here I'm going

228
00:19:15,935 --> 00:19:16,556
to fuse together.

229
00:19:16,576 --> 00:19:21,139
The first one, well, I guess it's just from Dan Cooper in chat, wants to know if you have

230
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:25,282
any recommendations for effective time management strategies when you're composing or preparing

231
00:19:25,322 --> 00:19:26,143
to compose for a game.

232
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:34,278
Nice, yeah, that is a really good thing to be thinking about how to make sure that you're meeting deadlines.

233
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:45,021
I, the first thing I do is make sure that I'm really well aware of when the deadlines are and how much material I'm going to need to prepare in order to meet them.

234
00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:50,164
Fortunately, I work with a music producer who helps me with the logistics.

235
00:19:50,384 --> 00:19:57,669
So just reminding me of when things need to be delivered and kind of general quality assurance

236
00:19:57,689 --> 00:20:02,552
so that I do a good job on meeting those deadlines and staying on schedule.

237
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:05,613
I think the deadlines are going to help.

238
00:20:07,814 --> 00:20:23,958
You can look at your own speed in terms of how many minutes of music you create a day, and then figure out what your working schedule and your workflow should be like in order to meet those deadlines.

239
00:20:24,239 --> 00:20:30,600
Everybody is going to have a different workflow, a different comfortable output per day.

240
00:20:31,781 --> 00:20:40,508
And that is going to be an important consideration when you figure out how you're going to schedule yourself how much time you'll need to devote to different tasks each day.

241
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:49,654
I think it's going to be a really personal choice too because we're all very different in the way we approach music composition so I wouldn't want to say there's one.

242
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:55,117
way of going about it that's going to be a one-size-fit-all solution. But as long as you're

243
00:20:55,137 --> 00:20:59,819
taking those deadlines really seriously and kind of looking at yourself and asking yourself,

244
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:07,902
what do I personally need to do to get those deadlines handled and to be on track? I think

245
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:08,663
you'll be okay then.

246
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:18,307
So for people looking to get into composing music, we have a question here from Mallory who wants to know how does an aspiring composer work their way up?

247
00:21:18,368 --> 00:21:21,730
Do you start as a composer's assistant or maybe a transcriptionist?

248
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:27,475
And then we also had another question asking about networking as a composer and kind of the same kind of trajectory.

249
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:28,115
Okay.

250
00:21:28,865 --> 00:21:31,128
All right, two part question. Let's see how you're doing.

251
00:21:31,148 --> 00:21:31,668
Sorry, sorry.

252
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:40,719
Okay, it's fine. Oh, this is good. Hey, here we go. GDC Summer. So, the first part of it was,

253
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:46,345
is it good to start as a transcriptionist or a composer's assistant in order to

254
00:21:46,726 --> 00:21:48,007
make your way into the industry?

255
00:21:48,768 --> 00:21:53,272
Unfortunately, I don't actually know a lot about that one because that's not the way I started.

256
00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:59,498
I started in a really weird way. I kind of had the bolt of lightning story and that makes me

257
00:21:59,538 --> 00:22:05,344
a bad person to ask when it comes to how to get into the industry. I happened to contact

258
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:09,928
the God of War team right when they were looking for somebody to join the composer team.

259
00:22:10,492 --> 00:22:15,674
on that project. And my timing just happened to be really, really good. So that was how I got my

260
00:22:15,714 --> 00:22:21,937
first gig. But you can't say, well, just, you know, send up a prayer and hope the timing is great.

261
00:22:21,957 --> 00:22:25,258
I, you know, that, that isn't something that I could...

262
00:22:25,618 --> 00:22:28,420
Cold calls don't work quite as well now as they used to, I don't think.

263
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,443
Well, I think it's still important to try to network, the second part of the question,

264
00:22:34,463 --> 00:22:36,865
networking I think is still important.

265
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:44,750
And doing something like this, being involved in conferences, I mean, of course, in-person conferences were really helpful for doing meetings and things.

266
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:52,014
But this can still, I think, help to get a new composer out there in the industry.

267
00:22:52,074 --> 00:22:55,596
If you can set up even online meetings, that could be helpful.

268
00:22:56,057 --> 00:22:57,918
And just get involved in the community.

269
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:07,306
Even writing articles about what you've learned from past projects and offering them up to the game audio community can increase your presence.

270
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:10,188
Because it really does matter if people know you're there.

271
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:27,618
If you have had experiences, even working with student teams and or small indie projects, and you feel like you can share an experience with other people about what you've learned, that can be really invaluable in order to

272
00:23:28,527 --> 00:23:31,289
Make people aware of who you are and what your skills are.

273
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,831
I think that can be very helpful.

274
00:23:33,951 --> 00:23:36,173
And if you're a student and you can get involved

275
00:23:36,213 --> 00:23:38,836
with student teams, that's amazing.

276
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:43,099
Because you can meet people who then can be a network

277
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,342
of contacts as you move forward into the industry

278
00:23:46,743 --> 00:23:48,744
and you can keep in touch with each other.

279
00:23:49,125 --> 00:23:51,066
And eventually you could work together again

280
00:23:51,106 --> 00:23:52,448
in a more professional capacity.

281
00:23:52,468 --> 00:23:53,969
So that's really fantastic.

282
00:23:55,638 --> 00:24:03,607
All right, next question here from Nicholas in chat wants to know, can you speak to the public acceptance of video game music and the Library of Congress game music event you participated in?

283
00:24:03,627 --> 00:24:14,658
Yeah, well, that was really exciting. I was asked to give a speech at the Library of Congress about game music, and it was the first

284
00:24:16,272 --> 00:24:32,346
event of its kind held at the Library of Congress, focusing specifically on game music. It was a great event. They had this whole arcade section where they had all of these retro games being played in these wonderful mahogany paneled rooms in the

285
00:24:34,608 --> 00:24:39,410
In the Library of Congress, it was just an amazing thing to watch people really excited about that

286
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:45,893
in such a hallowed setting. But I think it's important for just in terms of this Library

287
00:24:45,913 --> 00:24:52,517
of Congress event in which I was fortunate to be able to give a speech and at other sorts of

288
00:24:52,597 --> 00:24:58,740
events like that, like symphony tours are another good example. I think they're great in elevating

289
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:03,202
the awareness of gay music within a larger community, getting people.

290
00:25:03,522 --> 00:25:08,485
who might not be familiar with game music, more acquainted with it, and to understand that it

291
00:25:08,525 --> 00:25:14,669
really isn't the bleeps and bloops of yesteryear, that it is something that has grown as games have

292
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:21,192
grown, and it is now a serious art form that people who even aren't gamers could still appreciate.

293
00:25:22,414 --> 00:25:38,915
Symphony tours like the Assassin's Creed Symphony World Tour, in which I'm fortunate to have a composition feature, that is a great opportunity to elevate music from a game franchise and make more people aware of both the music itself and the franchise that it comes from.

294
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:44,540
So it's a great vehicle for visibility.

295
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,302
So I think more like that is fantastic.

296
00:25:47,562 --> 00:25:50,765
And things like the Library of Congress event are a great way

297
00:25:50,945 --> 00:25:56,470
to elevate the authenticity of what we're doing so that people realize

298
00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:02,175
that there's a lot of artistry and heart that goes into this music.

299
00:26:02,195 --> 00:26:05,658
And there's a skill level there that can be appreciated.

300
00:26:06,078 --> 00:26:10,242
by people who are looking for music just to be fans of.

301
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:13,845
So I think that all of that kind of stuff is really important,

302
00:26:13,945 --> 00:26:16,367
and I'm very grateful that more of it's happening now.

303
00:26:16,387 --> 00:26:21,091
I'm running out of time here, so I'm trying to sneak a few more quick questions in.

304
00:26:21,992 --> 00:26:25,995
Jeremy wants to know, with who or what functional roles do you most frequently

305
00:26:26,055 --> 00:26:28,137
and closely interact with as a game composer?

306
00:26:28,597 --> 00:26:31,120
And I'm going to add on to that, do you have any tips for kind of

307
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,122
communication between yourself and the teams you're working with?

308
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:41,663
Good one, yeah. Well, it's been my experience that that can vary really wildly depending upon

309
00:26:41,703 --> 00:26:45,564
the type of team you're working with. If you're working with an indie team, you may be working

310
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:52,967
with the grand poobah, you know, the game director, the game designer, someone with that title

311
00:26:53,007 --> 00:26:58,169
producer you might be working with. Sometimes if you're working with one of the larger publishers,

312
00:26:58,189 --> 00:27:02,590
you'll also be working with a producer because the music is being requisitioned by the publisher

313
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,211
and not by the development team. So,

314
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:23,655
The publisher has a producer who's specifically assigned to oversee your work and make sure everything's on track. On the other hand, if you're working with the development studio itself, sometimes it's an audio director, if you have a well thought out team for audio within that developer.

315
00:27:24,165 --> 00:27:35,428
It might be the audio director, might be a sound designer if it's a smaller development team and they don't really have a lot of audio folks. It just might be the sole audio person on that team you're talking to.

316
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:45,670
And there have been projects I've worked on who they've had nobody on audio at all and I've been talking to maybe a programmer or something like that.

317
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:53,112
So it really does depend upon the structure of the development team itself as to who you're going to be talking to.

318
00:27:53,929 --> 00:28:09,424
In terms of communication, I think you have to be sensitive to the way in which the team wants to communicate, because that's key. Everybody's different. And you don't want to try to assert your own preferences onto a team.

319
00:28:09,864 --> 00:28:12,065
Some teams are really comfortable with emails.

320
00:28:12,465 --> 00:28:17,288
There is an audio director I've worked with quite a lot who writes very long, complex,

321
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:22,010
and really helpful emails with lots of detail, and that's fantastic because then I can have

322
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:27,173
them in front of me and have everything very solidly stated and it's wonderful.

323
00:28:27,233 --> 00:28:27,913
So I love that.

324
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:31,074
But there are other teams that really don't like to work that way.

325
00:28:31,195 --> 00:28:33,816
It's more freewheeling and everything is about.

326
00:28:34,196 --> 00:28:39,259
In the moment expression. So there's a lot of Skype conversation going on or phone conversation

327
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:45,162
of Skype isn't your thing or Zoom, since that's where we are, or Zoom isn't your thing. So there's

328
00:28:45,202 --> 00:28:49,885
a lot of that kind of conversation happening. And if that's where the creativity is happening,

329
00:28:49,925 --> 00:28:55,688
that's where we need to be. We need to be comfortable with whatever communication form

330
00:28:56,289 --> 00:29:01,992
is at the heart of the way the team works, whether that's bulletin boards and Slack groups or

331
00:29:02,512 --> 00:29:03,233
Discord or

332
00:29:04,273 --> 00:29:08,456
on to a Zoom, Skype or through long emails,

333
00:29:08,836 --> 00:29:09,836
any way they want to do it.

334
00:29:09,897 --> 00:29:11,537
We need to be ready to do it that way.

335
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:14,199
And we need to be very happy to do it that way.

336
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,501
Usually when I talk to a development team

337
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:19,262
and they're starting to just get a sense

338
00:29:19,302 --> 00:29:20,423
of how we want to communicate,

339
00:29:20,923 --> 00:29:23,965
I'll say, I want to talk with you guys

340
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:25,506
in the way you normally do it.

341
00:29:25,626 --> 00:29:28,288
So how do you normally have these conversations?

342
00:29:28,928 --> 00:29:34,474
And then I'll work around that. And I feel like there's always a kind of a little sigh of relief

343
00:29:34,735 --> 00:29:38,179
on the part of the team. Oh, we don't have to change the way we do things.

344
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:43,384
And that means a lot. So that I want to make sure that that's the way everything goes.

345
00:29:43,404 --> 00:29:45,967
A lot of flexibility is important, it sounds like.

346
00:29:47,029 --> 00:29:50,450
I want to squeeze in one more question. It'll be a quick answer. I promise.

347
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,712
Jennifer wants to know if there's any music composition book in general

348
00:29:53,732 --> 00:29:56,853
you've read during your career that's had an impact on you or just in your

349
00:29:56,873 --> 00:29:59,514
resources you want to offer people looking to learn more about this. OK.

350
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:02,849
Well, in terms of the book, I've read quite a lot.

351
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:05,252
I'm always going back to the techniques of orchestration

352
00:30:06,313 --> 00:30:11,037
just because I find that dipping back into just the nuts and bolts

353
00:30:11,598 --> 00:30:16,182
of what we do is a is a really nice way to sort of touch base with the core of it.

354
00:30:16,863 --> 00:30:19,005
And if there is a like.

355
00:30:20,914 --> 00:30:28,877
A core tome that is your favorite book for just touching base with what it is to compose.

356
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:34,319
It doesn't have to be any particular book, but something that's just at the ground floor.

357
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:38,161
I think it's something, it's nice to have a book like that to come back to.

358
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:43,203
and to remind yourself of the things that were the most important just starting off.

359
00:30:43,483 --> 00:30:50,326
We can get really obsessed with some, you know, highfalutin, complicated techniques and

360
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:57,489
very ambitious and we kind of go off on these tangents. And it's important, I think, to kind of

361
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:05,053
step back periodically and just remember what music is at its heart. So that's the kind of

362
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:07,934
stuff I like to revisit over and over again.

363
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:11,427
And so I'm hoping I answered that question.

364
00:31:12,768 --> 00:31:17,873
I know, I'm a news editor at Gamasutra, and not to promote my stuff too much for my site,

365
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:22,698
but you do have a Gamasutra blog where you talk a lot about all your music background and the

366
00:31:22,738 --> 00:31:25,920
Library of Congress. You did a great blog on that. So that would be a great place to check

367
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:29,744
out and find more information. Oh yeah. Oh, and I'm just going to have to say

368
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:33,668
my book, A Composer's Guide to Gay Music, that can be helpful from the MIT Press.

369
00:31:35,114 --> 00:31:36,756
All right, that's all the time we have.

370
00:31:36,796 --> 00:31:38,898
Thank you everyone for so many wonderful questions.

371
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,699
I'm sorry, we couldn't get to all of them.

372
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,602
I hope you all have a wonderful GDC summer.

373
00:31:43,962 --> 00:31:47,065
There's plenty of other programming throughout today, the rest of today.

374
00:31:47,145 --> 00:31:49,227
We're just getting started today and tomorrow.

375
00:31:50,048 --> 00:31:54,352
I know particularly there's some GDC podcast live episodes tonight and tomorrow

376
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:56,413
that I'll be on that we have some great guests lined up.

377
00:31:57,274 --> 00:31:58,936
But there's tons of great other programming.

378
00:31:58,956 --> 00:32:00,477
So have a great day and enjoy your show.

379
00:32:00,737 --> 00:32:00,998
Thank you.
