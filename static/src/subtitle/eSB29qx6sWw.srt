1
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:07,406
This is part of the level design workshop.

2
00:00:07,426 --> 00:00:09,128
There's a lot of great level design talks,

3
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:11,091
so please check them out all through the day.

4
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:13,756
You'll get a lot of experience from a lot of great people.

5
00:00:13,776 --> 00:00:14,918
I hope to be one of them,

6
00:00:14,938 --> 00:00:16,881
and we're going to talk about God of War today.

7
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:16,941
So ...

8
00:00:18,738 --> 00:00:20,779
It is a real joy to be here at GDC.

9
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,560
And actually, we have a lot of learnings from God of War.

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,940
It's a very big game, so we're going

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,341
to try and compress a lot of it down into some simpler

12
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:29,341
learnings for you today.

13
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:31,282
A little bit about myself.

14
00:00:31,302 --> 00:00:33,642
I actually grew up in the Australian games industry.

15
00:00:33,682 --> 00:00:35,283
You can probably tell from my accent.

16
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:38,123
And other than spending my late teenage years

17
00:00:38,183 --> 00:00:40,724
working at a cheese store, working in games

18
00:00:40,804 --> 00:00:43,144
is pretty much the only job I've ever had.

19
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:49,849
And so if you are just starting out with your career or just getting started in level design,

20
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,252
I put these kids games up here because it's a great way to get started.

21
00:00:55,553 --> 00:01:01,937
And even though you might think that God of War would have tons of people from tons of different,

22
00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:06,420
huge AAA games, which some people do, a lot of people actually come from smaller backgrounds

23
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:10,323
and from kids games, THQ games, even smaller games than that.

24
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:12,303
So, if you're ever wondering where to get started,

25
00:01:12,343 --> 00:01:13,784
I always say just get your hands dirty

26
00:01:14,044 --> 00:01:16,205
and maybe I can show you some tricks today on how to do that.

27
00:01:17,485 --> 00:01:20,106
In addition, even though AAA games

28
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:23,147
themselves can be very big, heavy development experiences,

29
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,607
there's a lot of production behind them.

30
00:01:25,448 --> 00:01:27,388
There's a lot of rules and level design tropes

31
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,449
that I learned on smaller games.

32
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:32,130
And I like to say that good design is effective

33
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:32,930
at any scale.

34
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,011
And I hope that you can see how some of the tricks we're

35
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:38,032
going to look at today work on big projects

36
00:01:38,092 --> 00:01:39,472
or work on small projects.

37
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:44,061
Finally, we actually did have a lot of risks on this God of War game.

38
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:46,463
It's fabulous that it's come together so nicely.

39
00:01:46,503 --> 00:01:49,165
We have a lot of fans, which is always a great feeling.

40
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:53,428
But a lot of the rules I'll show you today are actually what I would call very traditional.

41
00:01:53,828 --> 00:01:58,392
And there's some that have been successful on many games, you know, other than God of War.

42
00:01:59,878 --> 00:02:03,100
This talk is primarily about the Stonemason level.

43
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,322
You can see here this fabulous environment art

44
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:06,303
is from Isabella May.

45
00:02:06,363 --> 00:02:08,345
It's one of my favorite levels in the game.

46
00:02:08,905 --> 00:02:11,207
And it is about 50 percent of the way through the game.

47
00:02:11,227 --> 00:02:13,889
So there's some minor spoilers, but nothing too major.

48
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,231
I won't go into anything too heavy.

49
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:19,654
But to talk about how the item use works in the game

50
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:21,235
and how the exploration works in the game,

51
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:23,376
I have to dive into it a little bit.

52
00:02:24,824 --> 00:02:26,724
As we step through the Stone Mason level,

53
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:28,145
I will keep coming back here a lot.

54
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:30,045
This is what I call the level design rule slide.

55
00:02:30,085 --> 00:02:31,285
We will come back here a few times.

56
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:34,206
Basically, what we are going to do is go over six major rules

57
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:35,246
from God of War's levels.

58
00:02:35,266 --> 00:02:38,086
There will be a little bit of time for questions at the end.

59
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:42,067
If we run out of time, I can meet you at room 305 or 308,

60
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:43,747
and we can keep discussing.

61
00:02:44,368 --> 00:02:46,708
My hope is that by showing you these rules

62
00:02:47,228 --> 00:02:49,008
and by showing you the Stone Mason level,

63
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:50,749
I can sort of use it as a microcosm

64
00:02:51,149 --> 00:02:52,609
for the level design of the game itself.

65
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:55,097
So we'll check back on this every now and then.

66
00:02:55,117 --> 00:02:57,178
It's sort of the anchor to the presentation.

67
00:02:57,198 --> 00:02:58,840
And then we'll go into the level.

68
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,361
I'll show you how the level rules work out in practice.

69
00:03:01,641 --> 00:03:03,222
And I'll show you some of the beats leading up to level.

70
00:03:03,262 --> 00:03:05,604
And you'll kind of get how the overall flow packages up

71
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:06,325
from level to level.

72
00:03:06,827 --> 00:03:08,728
So to get us started, here's our first rule.

73
00:03:08,748 --> 00:03:10,570
It's all about core pillars.

74
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,732
Sometimes a contentious topic in game design.

75
00:03:13,772 --> 00:03:15,893
Some people really like to use core pillars, some people don't.

76
00:03:16,373 --> 00:03:16,914
I think they're great.

77
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:20,356
I like core pillars because they let us know what to focus on.

78
00:03:20,456 --> 00:03:22,657
You could sort of think of them maybe as a lens of focus

79
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:24,439
that help us to all start getting thinking

80
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:26,000
in the same direction together.

81
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:29,912
And we can't do everything in every game ever,

82
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:31,333
nor do we really want to, right?

83
00:03:31,373 --> 00:03:34,195
Because if we do things with a bit of focus,

84
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:36,818
what we'll hopefully end up with is a few things

85
00:03:36,998 --> 00:03:38,319
that make the game really special,

86
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,081
something that actually helps to separate it

87
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:41,782
from every other game out there.

88
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:43,744
And so you can think of the core pillars

89
00:03:43,844 --> 00:03:45,045
as creative building blocks.

90
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:46,726
And as we step through this talk,

91
00:03:46,766 --> 00:03:48,348
I'll be going over core pillars a lot.

92
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:51,589
But before we do, here's a quick history lesson.

93
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:55,751
God of War 1, 2, 3, and Ascension, the PSP versions,

94
00:03:56,151 --> 00:03:59,392
they all have core pillars that focus on a few key areas

95
00:03:59,452 --> 00:03:59,812
as well.

96
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:03,033
You might describe them as combat, platforming,

97
00:04:03,253 --> 00:04:03,833
and puzzles.

98
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:06,354
And as you probably remember, God of War

99
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:07,774
was actually a game with a rail camera.

100
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:13,518
So it was often seen as this best-in-class bombastic action game, action adventure game.

101
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:19,463
But by 2014, there was a very strong feeling both inside the studio and outside the studio

102
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:23,346
that we needed to start looking at these core pillars and the anatomy that really makes

103
00:04:23,426 --> 00:04:24,506
up the game itself.

104
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,711
Now, for a franchise to switch up its core pillars

105
00:04:27,771 --> 00:04:29,873
is not the type of thing you want to do all the time, right?

106
00:04:30,254 --> 00:04:32,316
Because what you're actually going to start to look at is,

107
00:04:32,836 --> 00:04:34,177
are we reevaluating the things

108
00:04:34,197 --> 00:04:35,959
that players find most fun about this game?

109
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:38,221
We're going to actually start unpackaging that.

110
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:40,243
We're going to take all the pieces of the engine,

111
00:04:40,283 --> 00:04:42,465
spread them out on the floor, and see how they all fit together.

112
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,407
So, with that in mind, Cory Barlog, our creative director,

113
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:48,130
and a few key team members sort of siphoned themselves off

114
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:48,750
for a little while,

115
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:52,674
and they had the goal of creating a new set of pillars.

116
00:04:54,237 --> 00:04:56,600
The three pillars that they came up with,

117
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,102
and I won't step you through the full process

118
00:04:58,122 --> 00:04:59,124
of how this was generated,

119
00:04:59,664 --> 00:05:00,806
but they were very successful,

120
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:04,031
were combat, narrative, and exploration.

121
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:08,134
And for level design, this is a very big change.

122
00:05:08,855 --> 00:05:09,295
It's great.

123
00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:11,837
It starts to give us a lot of things to start focusing on.

124
00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:14,979
But it actually also starts tapping into a lot of things

125
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:17,781
that we sort of lack expertise in at Santa Monica Studio.

126
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:21,443
But it's a good opportunity to start thinking in new terms

127
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:23,604
and how we take on modern design challenges.

128
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:25,306
We can't keep doing the same thing forever,

129
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,947
so how do we start thinking with a new lens of focus?

130
00:05:28,648 --> 00:05:33,012
You can start asking yourself, all right, well, what would Combat 2.0 even mean?

131
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:35,875
How does this work with a new camera? How do encounters work?

132
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,537
How do we build fight spaces?

133
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,500
Sure, a lot of people say they want to be a modern narrative game,

134
00:05:41,721 --> 00:05:42,882
but what does that even mean?

135
00:05:43,102 --> 00:05:47,286
How do you tell stories? What are the components that come together to make that happen?

136
00:05:48,327 --> 00:05:51,770
And a lot of people think of exploration just in terms of larger spaces.

137
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,253
But how big is too big? How wide is too wide?

138
00:05:54,293 --> 00:05:57,316
What do you even do other than just exploring or roaming?

139
00:05:57,876 --> 00:06:00,619
And of course, at the center of all of this, you have Kratos and Atreus,

140
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,881
you know, trying to tell a father-son story.

141
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:06,064
So you're trying to take combat, narrative, and exploration

142
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:08,927
as your first pillars of focus.

143
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:10,628
And at the center of it, you're trying to think of

144
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:13,251
how this will all tie into a father-son story.

145
00:06:14,403 --> 00:06:16,245
Here's a quick version of Vision Book.

146
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:17,967
This is the one that Corey put together.

147
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:19,148
I think it was fabulous.

148
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:21,611
In fact, you can see all through the book

149
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:23,513
that combat narrative and exploration

150
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,034
are very heavily represented.

151
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:28,698
In fact, Corey believed so strongly at these three pillars

152
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:31,400
that you pretty much can't get a cup of coffee at the studio

153
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,922
without having to look at it, which

154
00:06:32,982 --> 00:06:36,125
is a particularly good way to start brainwashing everyone.

155
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,481
And I know this is something that designers really respected.

156
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,481
The fact that Corey stayed to these three pillars

157
00:06:43,561 --> 00:06:45,822
gave us some really strong anchors through the project

158
00:06:45,982 --> 00:06:46,782
that we could work on.

159
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:49,603
So, with these three pillars in mind,

160
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:50,963
as I step through the presentation,

161
00:06:51,003 --> 00:06:53,564
start to try to think about combat, narrative,

162
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:54,864
and exploration a lot.

163
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:58,465
This stonemason level did take a long time to put together.

164
00:06:58,665 --> 00:07:02,506
You know, we spent a long time tuning it and iterating on it,

165
00:07:02,606 --> 00:07:04,786
even with these great pillars that we could focus on.

166
00:07:05,723 --> 00:07:07,264
But the thing that's great about this level

167
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:08,285
is when it came together,

168
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:10,866
it sort of became a fully architected expression

169
00:07:10,906 --> 00:07:13,167
that delivered on combat narrative and exploration.

170
00:07:13,987 --> 00:07:15,708
And most importantly, it proved to us

171
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:18,069
that if you distribute those three pillars correctly,

172
00:07:18,489 --> 00:07:20,810
you can actually deliver on the variety of pacing

173
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,750
that we're looking to master.

174
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:25,532
Not just an action game and not just an adventure game,

175
00:07:25,572 --> 00:07:28,013
but a real mix of action and adventure, right?

176
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:31,274
So let's take a look with a bit of a deeper dive

177
00:07:31,354 --> 00:07:32,835
how the game and how the level

178
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:33,955
delivers on those three pillars.

179
00:07:34,695 --> 00:07:36,376
I'll start with the most obvious one, combat.

180
00:07:37,217 --> 00:07:38,918
Well, this, of course, details everything

181
00:07:38,938 --> 00:07:41,340
that is the most action-focused component of the game.

182
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,081
It's the capital A in action adventure.

183
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:46,343
And it's everything from Kratos' core attack loop

184
00:07:46,464 --> 00:07:49,065
to the AI he faces, the upgrades that can be achieved,

185
00:07:49,146 --> 00:07:51,968
and perhaps most importantly, how a support character

186
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:53,729
like Atreus might contribute to that fight.

187
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,136
You can see here inside the category of combat,

188
00:07:57,156 --> 00:07:58,677
there's actually a lot of sub-archetypes.

189
00:07:59,117 --> 00:08:01,278
It's not just arenas or fight spaces.

190
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:03,919
There's also sort of more wide linear scenarios

191
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:06,641
where you can take on the AI in more free-form ways.

192
00:08:07,181 --> 00:08:08,281
Down the bottom on the left there,

193
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:10,402
you'll see what I call a special rules scenario.

194
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:12,503
This one has a timer that sort of gets the variety

195
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,684
a bit different from everything else.

196
00:08:14,084 --> 00:08:15,165
Of course, you have boss battles,

197
00:08:15,185 --> 00:08:16,445
you have lots of different things

198
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:18,806
that come together to just make combat

199
00:08:18,926 --> 00:08:20,807
more than just fights, right?

200
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:23,352
So the core pillar of combat is great.

201
00:08:23,693 --> 00:08:26,155
It gives us a lot that we can start thinking about early on,

202
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:29,419
but what's really good about it is it has enough versatility

203
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:31,821
that we can start to create sub-archetypes inside it.

204
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:33,963
It's a great place for level designers

205
00:08:33,983 --> 00:08:35,064
to start to put their focus,

206
00:08:35,605 --> 00:08:37,146
and if you look at the Mason level here,

207
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,808
you'll see that it's pretty heavily distributed

208
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:40,750
throughout the level, exactly what you'd expect.

209
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,832
There's a lot of different fights that take place,

210
00:08:42,912 --> 00:08:43,993
and they're paced out really well.

211
00:08:45,731 --> 00:08:47,492
Secondly, narrative.

212
00:08:48,192 --> 00:08:50,273
Well, you might not expect that out of a God of War game,

213
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:51,873
especially with the history of the franchise.

214
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:54,274
God of War has actually always had a strong narrative

215
00:08:54,294 --> 00:08:57,095
through it, but it's never really been narrative gameplay.

216
00:08:57,596 --> 00:08:59,096
So what we can start thinking about now

217
00:08:59,176 --> 00:09:01,457
is what is the father-son adventure

218
00:09:01,477 --> 00:09:03,578
that Kratos and Atreus are actually going to go on?

219
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:04,418
It's

220
00:09:05,275 --> 00:09:08,357
The tone, it's the level's purpose, it's the overall lore.

221
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:12,079
A good level has a story and has an adventure behind it, right?

222
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:14,360
So we can actually start thinking about how to deliver on that.

223
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,342
Again, there's a few sub-archetypes of narrative gameplay that we can look into.

224
00:09:20,443 --> 00:09:23,424
You've got cut scenes, of course, but we tried to innovate on this

225
00:09:23,484 --> 00:09:25,345
by having no camera cuts throughout these.

226
00:09:26,085 --> 00:09:28,166
You can see there's sort of more slow-paced sections

227
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:30,928
where Kratos and Atreus can have conversations with one another.

228
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,504
Down the bottom, a lot of games are starting to become masters

229
00:09:35,544 --> 00:09:37,366
of this right now, environmental storytelling.

230
00:09:37,447 --> 00:09:39,489
How do we give the environment a sense of place?

231
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:41,071
How do we tie it into the overall law?

232
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:43,674
And of course, you can see on the bottom right,

233
00:09:43,774 --> 00:09:45,476
even Atreus has little animations

234
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:48,039
that we put in the levels to try and emphasize

235
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:50,642
and accentuate his state of mind.

236
00:09:51,453 --> 00:09:53,755
There's even little secrets that allow the player to find lore.

237
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:56,977
There's a lot of different categories inside that core pillar of narrative,

238
00:09:57,077 --> 00:09:57,718
and that's great.

239
00:09:58,158 --> 00:10:01,020
Again, like combat, it gives us a lot of different versatility

240
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,901
and variety that we can create inside the level.

241
00:10:03,942 --> 00:10:05,543
If you look at it from the top-down perspective,

242
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,486
you might even be surprised how much narrative is inside this level.

243
00:10:08,866 --> 00:10:11,348
And that doesn't even include the fact that you're in a level

244
00:10:11,428 --> 00:10:13,890
with a giant, interesting-looking fallen giant, right?

245
00:10:15,017 --> 00:10:18,178
So once again, you can see we're able to get a lot of variety

246
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:21,459
and density out of that sort of initial pillar of narrative.

247
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,060
And rounding out the three pillars is exploration.

248
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,361
And this is what I would consider

249
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:28,401
to be the most complicated of the three pillars.

250
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,314
The pillar of exploration is great.

251
00:10:31,534 --> 00:10:34,276
It represents the desire for larger layouts, sure.

252
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:37,258
It represents the desire for more wide linear spaces,

253
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:37,939
of course.

254
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,362
But it also represents the design shift in the camera.

255
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:44,583
The fact that you can actually move the camera around now

256
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:46,905
means every space is more explorable than before.

257
00:10:47,565 --> 00:10:50,729
There's a famous phrase taught to me earlier in my career

258
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:53,212
by Morgan Jaffa, which is, camera is genre.

259
00:10:53,512 --> 00:10:56,696
Where you place the camera is possibly what type of game

260
00:10:56,716 --> 00:10:57,297
you are making.

261
00:10:58,038 --> 00:11:00,420
And when we shift the camera from a real camera game

262
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:05,346
to a fully 3D game, now we have very explorable game

263
00:11:05,566 --> 00:11:07,308
just through the perspective of the camera.

264
00:11:08,477 --> 00:11:11,657
So you can start to once again break down exploration

265
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,258
into sub-archetypes and start to look at how the camera

266
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:15,498
provides new opportunities.

267
00:11:16,138 --> 00:11:17,639
It's more than just big spaces.

268
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:19,899
There's little puzzles that we can put all through the level

269
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:21,980
now that we can aim the camera in different perspectives.

270
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,780
We have optional fights that you can opt into.

271
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,141
Those are just great because they give you

272
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:27,181
a bit of player autonomy.

273
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:30,222
And finally, this level actually connects to the game's hub,

274
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:31,222
which is the Lake of Nine,

275
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:32,602
and we'll go into that a little bit later,

276
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:34,643
but it's a larger sort of discussion

277
00:11:34,683 --> 00:11:37,123
about how exploration on level-to-level flow works.

278
00:11:38,403 --> 00:11:40,845
So once again, you can see that exploration

279
00:11:40,885 --> 00:11:42,607
is pretty heavily represented in this level.

280
00:11:42,647 --> 00:11:44,348
Of course, it does bunch up a little bit

281
00:11:44,428 --> 00:11:46,770
in the most explorable space,

282
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,133
which is the mason's mini hub right in front of his head.

283
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:53,414
But also, if you look at the back end of the level,

284
00:11:53,735 --> 00:11:55,296
it's more than just building big spaces.

285
00:11:55,376 --> 00:11:57,637
We want you to seek out nooks and crannies in every room,

286
00:11:57,818 --> 00:11:59,979
even if it's a more linear space or a load hallway.

287
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:02,261
We want to fill that full of secrets, lore,

288
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:04,322
additional moments, and so forth.

289
00:12:05,383 --> 00:12:06,864
So when you put it all together,

290
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:11,631
I think you have a level that accurately delivers on the three pillars, combat, narrative and

291
00:12:11,671 --> 00:12:12,312
exploration.

292
00:12:13,153 --> 00:12:17,499
And if you use these correctly, you can achieve the variety and pacing that I think we're

293
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,823
looking to master, a mix of action and adventure.

294
00:12:22,248 --> 00:12:24,809
The stonemason level is sort of what you might call one of

295
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:27,311
the more level designer-y levels as well.

296
00:12:27,391 --> 00:12:28,571
It's particularly good at this.

297
00:12:28,651 --> 00:12:31,133
And it's not a full vertical slice, and we don't treat

298
00:12:31,193 --> 00:12:33,054
every level like a template or anything like that.

299
00:12:33,514 --> 00:12:36,256
But it was a particularly good level to get online early in

300
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:38,377
the project, because it really did prove to us that if you

301
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:40,758
mix and match these three pillars together, you can get

302
00:12:40,798 --> 00:12:43,099
a lot of versatility, and you can get a lot of variety.

303
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,501
And this is, in essence, why I believe in

304
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:46,441
core pillars so much.

305
00:12:47,455 --> 00:12:51,396
When you go to design spaces, front of mind for all designers

306
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,517
should really be, how do I use these?

307
00:12:54,017 --> 00:12:55,117
How do I mix and match them?

308
00:12:55,537 --> 00:12:57,958
How do I start to think about them to create a lot of focus?

309
00:12:58,418 --> 00:12:59,979
And if you do this, you'll end up

310
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:03,240
with a level that feels, a game that feels very different

311
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,940
from level to level, but still feels consistent

312
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,041
from the overall level to level experience.

313
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:11,402
So with that in mind, we'll add rule number one to our deck.

314
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:16,207
And we can start to look into our next most important technique,

315
00:13:16,247 --> 00:13:19,248
which is converting these pillars into recognizable metrics.

316
00:13:19,868 --> 00:13:21,308
And that's where rule number two comes in.

317
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:24,289
Early on in the project, we had to make a decision

318
00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:26,910
about what type of construction of this game we wanted to use.

319
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,631
And we made the decision that we were going to be a very metrics-focused game.

320
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:33,893
So we can start to think, how do our core pillars

321
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:36,794
and our metrics come together to help us architect spaces?

322
00:13:37,514 --> 00:13:39,194
A lot of people talk about design metrics.

323
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:40,755
What does it even mean?

324
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:41,895
Quick definition.

325
00:13:42,795 --> 00:13:46,377
I like to think of metrics as just a design measurement

326
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:47,958
that communicates gameplay.

327
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:49,499
If used correctly, you should start

328
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,080
to build a rhythm in your head as to what

329
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,201
the different measurements mean.

330
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:54,702
And all games have this.

331
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:58,645
If you're playing Tomb Raider, maybe jump heights and jump

332
00:13:58,665 --> 00:14:00,286
widths might be super important.

333
00:14:00,786 --> 00:14:03,607
Playing a racing game might be about width server.

334
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:08,169
paths or where we go on-road, off-road, all these types of things,

335
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:10,750
really important for what type of game you're making.

336
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,451
So of course the first question you should be asking is,

337
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:17,952
how do we make metrics that emphasize and accentuate the core pillars of the game?

338
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:22,274
Our task is to determine metrics that are most important

339
00:14:22,634 --> 00:14:25,235
for highlighting and promoting the goals of the game.

340
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:26,715
So...

341
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:31,523
With that in mind, you can start to quickly route your head,

342
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:33,424
once again, through the core pillars of the game.

343
00:14:34,044 --> 00:14:36,925
At a simplest level, well, for metrics for combat,

344
00:14:37,605 --> 00:14:39,666
we don't want snags or frustrations.

345
00:14:39,866 --> 00:14:42,368
OK, how do we create a metric that creates that?

346
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:45,169
For narrative, sure, it's easy enough

347
00:14:45,209 --> 00:14:46,870
to say we want no camera cuts.

348
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,511
But how do we actually create a metric to deliver on that goal?

349
00:14:50,451 --> 00:14:53,033
And for exploration, this is a game without a jump button.

350
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:55,015
When you're looking around the environments,

351
00:14:55,055 --> 00:14:58,178
how do we create more explorable spaces while also allowing

352
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,739
you to scan the horizon and start

353
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:01,480
to get a quick snapshot in the back of your head

354
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,902
as to what those metrics might mean?

355
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,404
If you get to a dead end and it doesn't actually

356
00:15:05,484 --> 00:15:07,345
reward exploration, you're going to be bummed out,

357
00:15:07,606 --> 00:15:08,947
not going to want to explore anymore, right?

358
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:11,649
So those metrics start to put a lot of psychology in your head.

359
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:16,786
This here is one of our most important team documents.

360
00:15:16,866 --> 00:15:18,267
It's called the Level Building Codes,

361
00:15:18,347 --> 00:15:20,769
and it was created by Michael Chang and James Riding.

362
00:15:21,349 --> 00:15:23,751
And it details all the metrics out in meters.

363
00:15:24,332 --> 00:15:26,253
You can see here that Kratos, he mostly

364
00:15:26,334 --> 00:15:28,295
uses one meters, two meters, and three meters.

365
00:15:28,355 --> 00:15:31,217
And we try to really stick to those values

366
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:34,100
as much as possible, even in more organic spaces.

367
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,162
You can see that he has five meters as kind of his drop-off

368
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:38,143
heights and so forth.

369
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:40,684
And as we start to get more complicated,

370
00:15:40,824 --> 00:15:43,465
all the different vaults and squeezes and wall presses,

371
00:15:43,645 --> 00:15:46,266
all these things have very clearly laid out metrics.

372
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:50,367
So if done correctly, the visual archetypes are established

373
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:52,028
and layouts remain clear.

374
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:54,949
Once you're happy with the metrics,

375
00:15:55,229 --> 00:15:57,530
they go into a test bed and you can examine them further.

376
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,030
Here's a quick example.

377
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,951
As he runs through, keep an eye on the three meters

378
00:16:02,071 --> 00:16:03,232
and we'll come back to that in a moment.

379
00:16:11,147 --> 00:16:12,428
So it's pretty straightforward stuff.

380
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:14,210
You can see everything's nicely laid out.

381
00:16:15,211 --> 00:16:17,193
It's easy to test that the animations are going to line

382
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:17,693
up correctly.

383
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:21,297
And boom, there's our 3 meter one right in front of us.

384
00:16:21,798 --> 00:16:24,761
Let's take a closer look at the 3 meter.

385
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:27,103
3 meter boost is, I love this one.

386
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:29,846
It's really simple because it's a vault that Kratos can

387
00:16:29,886 --> 00:16:31,448
do to get to an upper ledge.

388
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:40,847
It's not so high that you might feel like you're going to move to the next space or trigger the next cinematic or move on to a big fight or anything like that.

389
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,109
But it is just high enough that it removes you from the planar space.

390
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:46,170
And it's perpendicular.

391
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,652
It's a very strong, sharp edge.

392
00:16:49,132 --> 00:16:50,833
And it's roughly at Kratos' eye level.

393
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:52,374
So the 3-meter boost is great.

394
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,356
It can be used to separate the combat space a little bit.

395
00:16:55,456 --> 00:16:57,277
It can be used to reward a secret.

396
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:01,140
And if used correctly, it starts to build a rhythm in your head

397
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,522
as to what the role of the three meter boost may be.

398
00:17:03,542 --> 00:17:05,284
There's a lot of other archetypes.

399
00:17:05,344 --> 00:17:08,006
This is why people call metrics sometimes level Legos

400
00:17:08,206 --> 00:17:09,107
or similar like that.

401
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:10,908
Because when combined together, they

402
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:13,730
make a very traditional BSP layout, or sheet layout,

403
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:14,391
as we call it.

404
00:17:15,632 --> 00:17:17,553
This is the stonemason level early on.

405
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:21,396
And you can see that these metrics were very early attempts

406
00:17:21,496 --> 00:17:23,858
to start to see how these level rules may

407
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:24,719
start to come together.

408
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,221
Over here, you can see that there's some early attempts

409
00:17:28,261 --> 00:17:31,041
to get combat spaces and combat metrics laid out correctly.

410
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:34,022
Up the top, you can see early examples of vaults.

411
00:17:34,562 --> 00:17:35,642
And down on the bottom right,

412
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:37,423
you can see that these are some early attempts

413
00:17:37,463 --> 00:17:39,023
to start working out what these climb metrics

414
00:17:39,063 --> 00:17:40,503
and climb animations might look like.

415
00:17:41,263 --> 00:17:42,644
As we get further into development,

416
00:17:42,784 --> 00:17:44,424
these metrics were actually pretty successful,

417
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,764
and so we started to look into more advanced ones.

418
00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:51,045
Over here, you can see that we added little jump gaps.

419
00:17:51,365 --> 00:17:52,705
This is maybe a little bit more rhythm

420
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:54,946
that we can start to build into the nav metrics.

421
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:58,160
The environment artist told us that slopes

422
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,940
was something that was super important to them

423
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,781
based on their research of the Nordics.

424
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,242
So we started to look into what IK heights would be

425
00:18:04,262 --> 00:18:05,802
and how we could build with those in mind.

426
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:07,983
And finally, a point of pride for me

427
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,623
is you'll see over on the right-hand side

428
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,224
that initial metric that we created for the fight space

429
00:18:12,244 --> 00:18:13,644
has actually retained its design.

430
00:18:13,945 --> 00:18:16,765
And even as it got a more sort of detailed pass,

431
00:18:16,865 --> 00:18:18,206
it's actually held its structure.

432
00:18:18,906 --> 00:18:20,327
That's spot on.

433
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,327
This is the value of laying it out correctly.

434
00:18:23,531 --> 00:18:25,793
So when you step through the stonemason level,

435
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,575
you'll see there's a really basic core path.

436
00:18:28,035 --> 00:18:29,977
And now we can start to think, once again,

437
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:31,638
how will these metrics come together

438
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,020
to make combat, narrative, and exploration?

439
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:36,102
Here's our three combat spaces.

440
00:18:36,562 --> 00:18:38,544
You can see there is a more wide linear space

441
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,385
at the front of the level.

442
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:45,412
Up the back, we've got a more traditional arena scenario that takes place at the head where we can increase intensity.

443
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:55,003
And then actually, on the back right there, you'll see that this was a space that we also laid out to be another arena, which is a bit too similar back to back, right?

444
00:18:55,243 --> 00:18:58,687
So we had to introduce a character there to spice it up and make it a bit more interesting.

445
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:01,435
In terms of the narrative pillar,

446
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:04,158
you'll see that the Mason himself is pretty much

447
00:19:04,218 --> 00:19:05,379
a perfect narrative setup.

448
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:07,922
It's a fallen giant whose last breath

449
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:09,783
has frozen the entire world around him.

450
00:19:10,124 --> 00:19:10,924
It's a great setup.

451
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:12,546
But despite what you may think, we

452
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:14,027
don't know every line of dialogue

453
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:16,590
or every piece of narrative that is written

454
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,811
at the start of the project, right?

455
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:24,676
So what we try to do is lay out the space so that there's tons of opportunity for banter or environmental storytelling or set pieces in general.

456
00:19:25,077 --> 00:19:30,501
And that means that the writers can come in at different phases in the project and still make interesting moments between the characters.

457
00:19:31,801 --> 00:19:33,762
And finally, up the back there, this

458
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:35,303
is one of the cinematic transitions.

459
00:19:35,503 --> 00:19:37,444
This is a very early attempt to try and work out

460
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:38,905
how we were actually going to funnel you

461
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:41,727
from gameplay into cinematics with no camera cuts.

462
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:43,888
In this example, Kratos uses a climb.

463
00:19:44,228 --> 00:19:46,049
And that's a great way to limit his movements

464
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:48,511
so that we can start to create blends between gameplay

465
00:19:48,911 --> 00:19:49,571
and cinematics.

466
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,240
And in terms of exploration, you can actually see here,

467
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,180
this is where I showed you the jump gaps earlier.

468
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,880
This was kind of a failed experiment,

469
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,401
even though the level designer, Kai Zheng,

470
00:19:58,421 --> 00:20:00,321
did an incredible job of this level.

471
00:20:01,281 --> 00:20:03,062
Actually, we found out that if you are a game

472
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,082
without a jump button, it is just not that fun

473
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:07,002
to move around and lean into the nav.

474
00:20:07,462 --> 00:20:09,003
So later on, we actually swapped these out

475
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:11,303
with little bonus puzzles that involved throwing the axe,

476
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:13,404
which we thought was a bit more in tune

477
00:20:13,424 --> 00:20:16,044
with the game's strengths rather than maybe its limitations.

478
00:20:16,724 --> 00:20:17,885
So once you string it all together,

479
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:21,764
you have a layout that can actually fit all in Maya,

480
00:20:22,104 --> 00:20:24,447
which is great, because we don't have camera cuts

481
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:26,629
in this game, so it's really important

482
00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:28,371
that we can actually fit it all in one scene,

483
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:29,852
and it's great for workflow.

484
00:20:30,701 --> 00:20:35,182
So you can probably tell from how much I am going into this

485
00:20:35,802 --> 00:20:37,743
that I am really proud of how the level designer,

486
00:20:37,783 --> 00:20:38,783
Kai, did with this.

487
00:20:39,284 --> 00:20:40,924
If you strip away the production of the level,

488
00:20:41,404 --> 00:20:44,005
there is a lot of really simple rules that make up this space.

489
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:46,366
They are not super fancy, and they are not super complicated.

490
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:48,306
They are just a lot of repeatable metrics

491
00:20:48,386 --> 00:20:50,067
and repeatable pieces that come together

492
00:20:50,087 --> 00:20:51,107
to make an overall layout.

493
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:54,268
And ultimately, it is the core pillars

494
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:56,849
and those initial metrics that are the first building blocks

495
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:57,829
of level construction.

496
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,391
If you know your core pillars,

497
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,533
and you have a generally clear layout,

498
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:04,135
I believe you'll have a strong canvas

499
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:05,916
for more complicated decisions, right?

500
00:21:06,257 --> 00:21:07,838
And if you do the groundwork to do that,

501
00:21:07,898 --> 00:21:09,860
you can start to take on more complex things,

502
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,283
like variety, pacing, mixing it up, all these things.

503
00:21:13,923 --> 00:21:15,465
Which brings us to our next set of rules,

504
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:17,106
achieving variety.

505
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:17,166
So,

506
00:21:19,618 --> 00:21:24,502
I mentioned a lot that we're always looking for the mix of action and adventure, right?

507
00:21:24,522 --> 00:21:30,006
Never leaning too hard into making the action fatiguing and never leaning too softly into

508
00:21:30,026 --> 00:21:31,047
the adventuring elements.

509
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:36,291
And since the game's been out for a while now, we do hear from players that they feel

510
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:39,914
like it has a good mix of scenarios, including combat, narrative, and exploration.

511
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:41,214
Which is awesome.

512
00:21:41,714 --> 00:21:42,975
I'm really glad to hear that.

513
00:21:43,035 --> 00:21:44,655
And you never know until the game ships, right?

514
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:47,476
So when you hear that, you're very relieved in some ways.

515
00:21:48,796 --> 00:21:50,957
And also, players often tell us that they

516
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,618
feel like it keeps moving from a moment-to-moment perspective,

517
00:21:53,658 --> 00:21:54,478
that it stays fresh.

518
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:56,939
So with that in mind, I want to detail two rules

519
00:21:56,959 --> 00:21:59,039
that I think are really important for achieving variety.

520
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,021
The first is that all levels sort of promote or sell

521
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:05,841
a major theme throughout the level.

522
00:22:05,901 --> 00:22:08,422
I'm fond of saying good levels have a strong theme.

523
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:13,031
So put simply, to create a theme or variety,

524
00:22:13,591 --> 00:22:15,812
there has to be some kind of unique gameplay element,

525
00:22:15,912 --> 00:22:19,214
something that acts as a start point or an inception,

526
00:22:19,494 --> 00:22:21,215
maybe like a nucleus for an idea.

527
00:22:21,235 --> 00:22:23,736
And our hope is that that will give us

528
00:22:23,916 --> 00:22:26,437
a breadth of different scenarios that we can create.

529
00:22:27,578 --> 00:22:29,339
And once that unique gameplay element

530
00:22:29,399 --> 00:22:31,680
or that unique level toy or whatever you wanna call it

531
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,660
has been established,

532
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:35,241
it sort of becomes an anchor for the level.

533
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,112
If you establish it correctly in the level

534
00:22:38,152 --> 00:22:40,614
and you teach it correctly, then we can be confident

535
00:22:40,874 --> 00:22:43,276
that we can start throwing more complex scenarios

536
00:22:43,316 --> 00:22:44,997
at the player and more complexity

537
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:47,759
and more variety at the player through the course of the level.

538
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,661
And once you've got enough of these scenarios strung together,

539
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:52,583
you've got a theme, right?

540
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,525
So that brings us to our second rule.

541
00:22:56,045 --> 00:22:58,807
All critical path levels unlock a new ability.

542
00:23:00,228 --> 00:23:02,110
Put simply, these are distributed

543
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,371
about every 90 to 120 minutes or so.

544
00:23:05,997 --> 00:23:08,618
And as above, these are the unique gameplay elements

545
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:10,138
that drive the theme throughout the level.

546
00:23:10,938 --> 00:23:12,859
Most importantly, since a new one's unlocked

547
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:15,300
every 90 to 120 minutes, it helps the level

548
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,220
to make it feel different from the one before it,

549
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:19,701
and it helps the level to make it feel different

550
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:20,582
from the one after it.

551
00:23:20,602 --> 00:23:21,942
It's a lot of good variety.

552
00:23:22,002 --> 00:23:23,783
It prevents a lot of blandness, right,

553
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,483
which is always a little bit of the fear.

554
00:23:25,603 --> 00:23:27,744
Making bland levels is not great.

555
00:23:28,404 --> 00:23:30,805
So, you pair these two rules together, you've got a basic flow.

556
00:23:31,366 --> 00:23:36,208
Every level unlocks a new ability, and then we can use that ability to drive a theme throughout

557
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:36,568
the level.

558
00:23:38,889 --> 00:23:42,391
And once we know our unique ability, the level designer can sort of go hog-wild.

559
00:23:42,411 --> 00:23:47,334
We can start to think about how this mechanic will work with combat, narrative, and exploration.

560
00:23:48,223 --> 00:23:49,784
If it's a really great mechanic, it

561
00:23:49,884 --> 00:23:51,465
should be able to talk to all three

562
00:23:51,505 --> 00:23:54,267
of the most important elements of the game.

563
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,609
Personal favorite of mine is the hook shot.

564
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:57,850
Everyone loves the hook shot.

565
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,231
You can use it to navigate.

566
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:00,192
You can use it to fight.

567
00:24:00,252 --> 00:24:01,413
You can grab rupees with it.

568
00:24:01,433 --> 00:24:02,494
You can solve puzzles with it.

569
00:24:02,814 --> 00:24:04,615
The hook shot literally talks to everything

570
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:06,517
in the game that is the most important element.

571
00:24:06,557 --> 00:24:08,798
And that's why it is so meaningful to the player.

572
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,563
And so if paced correctly and the items are meaningful,

573
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:15,984
then players will actually get excited

574
00:24:16,064 --> 00:24:17,625
and anticipate the next big unlock.

575
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,314
So here is the ability that's utilized in the Stone Mason

576
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:21,575
level.

577
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:23,297
It's called the Shock Arrow.

578
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:25,520
And Shock Arrows are super basic.

579
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:29,225
Shock Arrows are magic arrows that Atreus

580
00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:31,008
can fire at red crystals.

581
00:24:31,749 --> 00:24:32,890
And they go, boom.

582
00:24:33,511 --> 00:24:34,052
That's pretty much it.

583
00:24:34,993 --> 00:24:37,275
But it's actually awesome because its simple design

584
00:24:37,495 --> 00:24:38,896
allows for a lot of versatility.

585
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:40,718
If it's too complex a level mechanic,

586
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:42,079
then we're really going to struggle

587
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,180
to create a lot of variety,

588
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,622
or we're going to struggle to have scenarios

589
00:24:45,642 --> 00:24:47,023
where the player might be under duress

590
00:24:47,243 --> 00:24:49,125
and actually be able to use the mechanic.

591
00:24:49,525 --> 00:24:51,527
So its simplicity is actually terrific.

592
00:24:52,047 --> 00:24:54,970
So, of course, before it looks like this in the game,

593
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,331
we do a really basic prototype

594
00:24:56,351 --> 00:24:58,012
to make sure it's actually fun

595
00:24:58,132 --> 00:25:00,434
and that it's going to deliver on this potential versatility

596
00:25:00,454 --> 00:25:00,875
and variety.

597
00:25:01,855 --> 00:25:03,036
And here is the prototype.

598
00:25:58,795 --> 00:26:01,420
So this level prototype was actually created by John Marcello,

599
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,664
who's one of the senior designers at Santa Monica Studio.

600
00:26:04,124 --> 00:26:05,567
We started this project so long ago,

601
00:26:05,627 --> 00:26:07,851
he actually used the touch pad as the prototype.

602
00:26:08,893 --> 00:26:10,856
And everyone thought it generally had potential.

603
00:26:11,582 --> 00:26:14,343
So from there, it went through some additional iterations

604
00:26:14,383 --> 00:26:16,524
to find out what the best controls and rules would be.

605
00:26:16,764 --> 00:26:18,284
We have a whole systems design department

606
00:26:18,304 --> 00:26:20,385
that are really masters of this domain.

607
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:23,006
And then as level designers, we try to use those mechanics.

608
00:26:24,046 --> 00:26:26,347
But eventually, it was determined

609
00:26:26,387 --> 00:26:29,068
that it would be even cooler if Atreus could help you out.

610
00:26:29,168 --> 00:26:32,109
We might get back a little bit more combat, exploration,

611
00:26:32,449 --> 00:26:32,889
and narrative.

612
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,130
Maybe we can actually get father-son connection out

613
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:36,130
of this mechanic as well.

614
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:38,393
So it was added to Atreus's bow.

615
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,958
Basically, you press square, and Atreus fires the arrow for you.

616
00:26:41,978 --> 00:26:44,722
It's pretty simple, but as I mentioned,

617
00:26:45,343 --> 00:26:47,606
our desire is to create father-son connection

618
00:26:47,646 --> 00:26:50,030
and also give the level designers a lot of versatility

619
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,191
in scenario design.

620
00:26:52,245 --> 00:26:54,405
As you can see here, this mechanic is awesome

621
00:26:54,705 --> 00:26:56,606
because it can be used on tons of different stuff.

622
00:26:56,726 --> 00:26:57,706
And the red material,

623
00:26:57,966 --> 00:26:59,646
which does actually have some narrative in the game,

624
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:02,147
it's kind of the roots of the Yadraz school tree.

625
00:27:02,647 --> 00:27:05,708
So between visual development and the level mechanic team,

626
00:27:06,068 --> 00:27:08,728
and between the level designers and the environment artists,

627
00:27:08,788 --> 00:27:10,769
we're able to create tons of versatility

628
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:13,009
as to how this red sap or this red material

629
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:14,030
can be placed around the level.

630
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,510
Spot on, because that's the thing

631
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,771
that's going to allow us to create an established theme

632
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:19,431
throughout the level.

633
00:27:20,878 --> 00:27:23,439
In addition, it was thought that we had a pretty good mechanic,

634
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:26,400
but that we could get a bit of additional play out of it,

635
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,981
once again, to push variety.

636
00:27:28,341 --> 00:27:30,961
So there was the decision made to add a throwable element,

637
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:31,902
which is awesome.

638
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:33,822
Now we can have static scenarios,

639
00:27:34,102 --> 00:27:36,723
and we can have scenarios that allow a bit more player

640
00:27:36,763 --> 00:27:37,263
creativity.

641
00:27:39,488 --> 00:27:42,230
And finally, once we're really happy with it,

642
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,392
late in development, we polish it

643
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,113
so that it can accentuate its role

644
00:27:46,273 --> 00:27:49,275
and be a very prominent theme throughout the level.

645
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:51,396
You can see here that it has an inner glow

646
00:27:51,696 --> 00:27:54,338
so that it pops just a little bit more, tiny bit arcadey.

647
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,800
And you can also see that as you pass the camera

648
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,241
around this object, it has a little bit of sheen on it

649
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,583
so that it's likely to just catch your eye

650
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:02,603
as you move the camera.

651
00:28:04,605 --> 00:28:08,667
So let's take a look at one of the scenarios in the level

652
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:11,628
and how it works with the core pillars.

653
00:28:12,048 --> 00:28:14,129
Once again, try to think of this in terms of combat,

654
00:28:14,449 --> 00:28:15,730
narrative, and exploration.

655
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,611
I'll start with narrative here.

656
00:28:18,471 --> 00:28:22,033
This sort of concept of a puzzle is great

657
00:28:22,373 --> 00:28:23,514
for slowing down the player

658
00:28:23,634 --> 00:28:25,655
and just having narrative moments in general.

659
00:28:25,715 --> 00:28:27,075
In fact, maybe after a little while,

660
00:28:27,135 --> 00:28:29,076
the AI partner can even give you a hint.

661
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,124
This scenario is also terrific because it's been fabulously integrated by the environment art team.

662
00:28:35,144 --> 00:28:39,568
It's actually the ring finger of the giant, so it foreshadows the narrative that you're going to see further on.

663
00:28:40,148 --> 00:28:44,732
And you may not know this, but all the runes on the ring were actually translated by someone,

664
00:28:44,752 --> 00:28:48,075
so they all actually have real meaning if you go back and translate them,

665
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:49,836
if you're really into the narrative of the game.

666
00:28:51,349 --> 00:28:54,411
So in terms of exploration, well, you can see here

667
00:28:54,431 --> 00:28:56,012
he's blowing up an additional secret,

668
00:28:56,293 --> 00:28:59,135
and that may not be exploration per se, right?

669
00:28:59,175 --> 00:29:01,257
It's not a super explorable space.

670
00:29:01,277 --> 00:29:03,158
He didn't find a hidden dungeon or anything like that.

671
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,100
But really, it's kind of more of a gimme.

672
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,162
It's a tutorial for exploration.

673
00:29:07,222 --> 00:29:09,163
It's teaching you, keep an eye out

674
00:29:09,203 --> 00:29:10,845
for future scenarios like this,

675
00:29:11,105 --> 00:29:14,528
and keep your brain checked for shock crystals,

676
00:29:14,828 --> 00:29:18,211
because shock crystals can equal secrets, right?

677
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:18,751
And so...

678
00:29:19,412 --> 00:29:23,053
This is a little bit of a gimme, but it does sort of train you on exploration.

679
00:29:23,953 --> 00:29:27,995
And then finally, for combat, well the shock arrows are really great for combat in general.

680
00:29:28,035 --> 00:29:31,256
That was already thought of because Atreus can actually use them in combat scenarios,

681
00:29:31,296 --> 00:29:33,077
give you an advantage, they have a whole skill tree.

682
00:29:33,577 --> 00:29:38,239
This is where I love this scenario because if you actually fire a shock arrow in combat,

683
00:29:39,252 --> 00:29:42,155
at the ring, you can get an AOE and you can actually blast the AI.

684
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:46,639
So everything starts to talk to each other and you can even sort of experiment with it

685
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:47,720
while under duress.

686
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,982
That's part of the advantage of it being so simple.

687
00:29:52,045 --> 00:29:53,426
Now, you may not remember these scenarios.

688
00:29:53,446 --> 00:29:55,528
I actually showed you them at the top of the presentation.

689
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:57,189
But a lot of the scenarios I showed you

690
00:29:57,249 --> 00:29:59,191
actually had shot crystals in the background.

691
00:29:59,671 --> 00:30:00,312
Let's take a look.

692
00:30:00,972 --> 00:30:04,155
You'll see that this is the first one I showed you,

693
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:06,317
where it's just in the background.

694
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:08,799
Maybe it hints to you that you can get a bit of damage

695
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:09,920
if you're experimental.

696
00:30:10,461 --> 00:30:12,783
You can see that it can be used for throwable puzzles

697
00:30:12,963 --> 00:30:13,724
in the top right.

698
00:30:14,764 --> 00:30:19,366
Down below, it's actually used for a shot crystal chandelier section.

699
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:23,328
And the thing that's sort of nice about the shot crystals is even though they are kind of big and glowy,

700
00:30:23,368 --> 00:30:25,509
we're able to get them into a lot of the environments.

701
00:30:25,969 --> 00:30:30,831
So they can even be in the background of cinematics without being like too offensive or anything like that.

702
00:30:31,451 --> 00:30:33,352
Let's take a look at it from a top-down perspective.

703
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:38,134
Once again, you'll see that the shock arrows are really nicely distributed throughout the level.

704
00:30:38,574 --> 00:30:41,876
And I love that, because that is the thing that is making it a theme.

705
00:30:42,456 --> 00:30:46,198
Some players even called it the shock arrow level when they would come at a playtest,

706
00:30:46,218 --> 00:30:48,559
which if you're a level designer is the real compliment, right?

707
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,840
When they ignore everything else and just talk about the mechanics.

708
00:30:53,905 --> 00:30:55,988
And it was also great from a production perspective and

709
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:58,772
a code perspective because as I mentioned at the top of the presentation,

710
00:30:58,812 --> 00:31:00,334
we can't code every feature ever.

711
00:31:00,474 --> 00:31:03,658
We're in a very fortunate situation to have so much support from Sony.

712
00:31:04,058 --> 00:31:07,263
But even still, we have limitations and we don't want to code everything ever.

713
00:31:07,523 --> 00:31:11,168
So using the shock arrow is still a very efficient use of the mechanic as well.

714
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,864
So you can probably tell from my pride and joy with all these scenarios that I think

715
00:31:15,884 --> 00:31:18,546
the level designer, Kai, absolutely crushed it.

716
00:31:18,787 --> 00:31:21,129
I think this is one of the best themes throughout the game.

717
00:31:21,449 --> 00:31:23,091
This is what I love about level design.

718
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:25,213
And he really nailed the flow.

719
00:31:25,573 --> 00:31:30,678
Level unlocks a key item, and then the level uses that item to create a strong theme throughout

720
00:31:30,718 --> 00:31:30,998
the level.

721
00:31:31,884 --> 00:31:33,825
But there is an additional detail to this.

722
00:31:34,385 --> 00:31:37,587
As I alluded to, every level unlocks a key item, right?

723
00:31:38,167 --> 00:31:41,169
And that starts to touch on how we think about more of the

724
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:43,031
level-to-level experience and what the

725
00:31:43,191 --> 00:31:44,491
overarching experience is.

726
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:47,754
So with that in mind, the next rule is all

727
00:31:47,774 --> 00:31:49,335
about creating a format.

728
00:31:51,096 --> 00:31:51,856
What is a format?

729
00:31:51,896 --> 00:31:55,118
Some people talk about format maybe like structure or

730
00:31:55,478 --> 00:31:55,939
something like that.

731
00:31:57,011 --> 00:31:59,192
I like to define it as the intuitive rules

732
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:01,333
by which levels flow into one another.

733
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:04,255
So, if the pieces are lined up correctly,

734
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,436
you can start to create some psychology and a mental layer,

735
00:32:07,897 --> 00:32:09,558
and players can start to identify

736
00:32:09,618 --> 00:32:11,539
with how they'll engage in sessions

737
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:12,699
and how they'll play levels.

738
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,201
In God of War, there's actually a lot of different types of content.

739
00:32:16,281 --> 00:32:19,723
There's critical path levels, there's exploration levels,

740
00:32:20,303 --> 00:32:22,524
even little puzzles that are optional.

741
00:32:22,964 --> 00:32:25,446
There's actually entire areas you can discover on your own.

742
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:29,736
So it's really important that we start to build some expectations in the player's head.

743
00:32:30,717 --> 00:32:34,744
If you enter a story mission in a game, how do you know intuitively that you're going

744
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:38,050
to maybe start like 60 minutes worth of content and start to get into it?

745
00:32:39,213 --> 00:32:42,035
there's some psychology and consistency within the game

746
00:32:42,055 --> 00:32:43,736
to start establishing that rhythm in your head.

747
00:32:44,356 --> 00:32:46,818
And if you go down a side path and you think to yourself,

748
00:32:46,918 --> 00:32:48,759
oh, awesome, here I go, down this little side path,

749
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:49,960
I know the main path's over there,

750
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,862
well, that means it was a correctly signaled B path.

751
00:32:53,082 --> 00:32:55,784
That means it was correctly set up through the level design

752
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,325
to intuitively let you know

753
00:32:57,385 --> 00:32:59,446
that you're going down the side path, not the main path.

754
00:33:00,387 --> 00:33:03,368
Regardless, in God of War, we are often described

755
00:33:03,428 --> 00:33:06,290
as maybe having a bit of a Metroidvania element

756
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,111
or something like that.

757
00:33:07,955 --> 00:33:09,535
And we often hear from players that they

758
00:33:09,575 --> 00:33:11,196
know when they can continue the story

759
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:14,057
and when they can go exploring, which is great.

760
00:33:14,477 --> 00:33:15,938
That's exactly what I'm looking for.

761
00:33:16,518 --> 00:33:18,619
So our next rule works with all the previous rules

762
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:21,580
before it to try and create those expectations

763
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,220
and deliver on those results for the player.

764
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:24,821
It's really simple.

765
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:27,902
It's just about giving the player a clear exploration

766
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:28,122
break.

767
00:33:29,735 --> 00:33:32,196
As I mentioned before, all levels,

768
00:33:32,256 --> 00:33:34,137
they give you a key item, right?

769
00:33:34,997 --> 00:33:37,398
And our exploration break is the opportunity

770
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:38,679
for you to experiment with that.

771
00:33:38,939 --> 00:33:42,580
It's the thing that lets you know that it's time to go

772
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,721
and use it in a more playful or freeform way.

773
00:33:45,361 --> 00:33:47,502
So, I'll go into a step deeper on how that flow

774
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:49,863
achieves basically the Metroidvania element.

775
00:33:51,123 --> 00:33:53,004
So, in the previous level, as I mentioned,

776
00:33:53,204 --> 00:33:54,644
the theme is the shock arrow.

777
00:33:54,764 --> 00:33:57,005
And we try to deliver on that all throughout the level.

778
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,815
But what you may not have noticed is that the shock arrow actually ceases around the

779
00:34:01,895 --> 00:34:03,677
three-quarter point in the level.

780
00:34:04,318 --> 00:34:06,741
On the way back out through the level, there's no more shock arrow scenarios.

781
00:34:06,821 --> 00:34:08,103
So what's the deal?

782
00:34:08,143 --> 00:34:10,506
Did we, like, run out of money or run out of ideas?

783
00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:11,226
Something like that?

784
00:34:11,987 --> 00:34:14,550
No, this is actually where the boss battle takes place in the level.

785
00:34:14,951 --> 00:34:17,454
It's what you might describe as the key turning point.

786
00:34:18,886 --> 00:34:21,748
So going back to our triangle, the first three quarters

787
00:34:21,948 --> 00:34:23,649
of the level delivers on the theme.

788
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,530
And then we hit a key turning point.

789
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,771
Now, it doesn't have to be a boss battle.

790
00:34:26,791 --> 00:34:27,592
It can be anything you want.

791
00:34:27,612 --> 00:34:28,852
It can be a key story moment.

792
00:34:28,892 --> 00:34:31,374
It can be a major chest or some kind of a choir.

793
00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:32,995
It can even be a revelation for the character.

794
00:34:33,956 --> 00:34:36,377
But what matters is the final quarter of the level

795
00:34:36,437 --> 00:34:38,679
is dedicated to teaching the new item

796
00:34:38,999 --> 00:34:40,320
or teaching the new ability.

797
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:45,180
If done correctly, it's an embedded tutorial of sorts.

798
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,243
It's sort of the type of thing where learning is fun.

799
00:34:48,524 --> 00:34:49,865
It's a hard thing to accomplish.

800
00:34:49,885 --> 00:34:51,808
But if you do it, then the player

801
00:34:51,828 --> 00:34:54,952
is sort of fooled into the fact that they're doing a tutorial.

802
00:34:55,652 --> 00:34:57,475
And then to wrap it up, our last rule

803
00:34:58,095 --> 00:34:59,677
finishes with an exploration break.

804
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:00,618
So.

805
00:35:01,563 --> 00:35:05,106
Going back to our top-down map, the first three quarters

806
00:35:05,526 --> 00:35:07,908
of the level makes up the shock arrow distribution.

807
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:12,572
And then our boss battle here creates the key turning point.

808
00:35:13,093 --> 00:35:15,215
And then we use the last 25% of the level

809
00:35:15,295 --> 00:35:17,997
to reward the new item, which in this case is a magic chisel

810
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:20,639
that he can use to unlock different doors around the game.

811
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,642
There's three scenarios, so you confidently learn.

812
00:35:23,702 --> 00:35:25,384
You know, three's always a great design number.

813
00:35:26,084 --> 00:35:28,646
And then finally, we wrap up with an exploration break.

814
00:35:30,115 --> 00:35:32,618
So in summary, we have everything we need now.

815
00:35:32,978 --> 00:35:34,100
We've created a strong theme,

816
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,862
and we've given you an exciting item,

817
00:35:36,882 --> 00:35:38,124
we've taught you how to use it,

818
00:35:38,544 --> 00:35:40,546
and now we capitulate with an exploration break.

819
00:35:41,267 --> 00:35:42,348
What is the net result here?

820
00:35:42,528 --> 00:35:44,791
Why is this even important?

821
00:35:45,725 --> 00:35:48,747
Well, it creates a very natural motivator to explore.

822
00:35:49,227 --> 00:35:52,249
You are excited to go exploring because you got a new toy,

823
00:35:52,429 --> 00:35:53,690
and you only got to use it three times,

824
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,091
so you might want to keep using it, right?

825
00:35:55,511 --> 00:35:56,111
It's brand new.

826
00:35:57,232 --> 00:35:59,874
And you're motivated to explore because you might have actually

827
00:35:59,914 --> 00:36:02,635
seen areas in the game that use this ability.

828
00:36:02,675 --> 00:36:04,457
That's great level design if we can plant it

829
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,597
in your head as you go.

830
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:09,063
And finally, you're given a very clearly signaled break.

831
00:36:09,464 --> 00:36:10,406
You don't have to worry.

832
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:12,510
You know that this is a good time to explore.

833
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:14,675
You know that this is a good time to go off the path.

834
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:17,701
And you know this is a good time to confidently explore

835
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:18,282
an experiment.

836
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:23,071
To put it simply, it actually takes a lot of mental load

837
00:36:23,231 --> 00:36:25,591
to plan a path around an exploration space,

838
00:36:25,691 --> 00:36:29,432
to navigate by POIs, to look for secrets, to find things.

839
00:36:29,932 --> 00:36:32,373
And I want you to use your entire mental energy on that.

840
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:34,033
I don't want you to be wondering if you

841
00:36:34,053 --> 00:36:36,454
know how to use an ability or if you know if it's

842
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:37,854
the right time to be exploring.

843
00:36:38,134 --> 00:36:40,335
So by threading you in the back part of the level

844
00:36:40,475 --> 00:36:42,175
through the tutorial experience, we

845
00:36:42,215 --> 00:36:43,776
can make sure that when you go exploring,

846
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:46,576
you have everything you need to go to the hub.

847
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,551
Now here's how we achieve a format.

848
00:36:49,971 --> 00:36:51,912
You stack a few of these triangles back to back,

849
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:54,034
and you have a consistent format that

850
00:36:54,054 --> 00:36:56,375
can be used to inspire and motivate from a level

851
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:57,355
to level perspective.

852
00:36:58,476 --> 00:36:59,576
Our first level starts.

853
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:01,437
We teach a theme throughout the level.

854
00:37:02,324 --> 00:37:05,187
We hit a key turning point, we reward a new item,

855
00:37:05,407 --> 00:37:06,809
we give you a clear break to explore.

856
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:10,053
That item is then reutilized through the next level

857
00:37:10,093 --> 00:37:11,475
so we can get a lot of value out of it.

858
00:37:11,535 --> 00:37:13,518
We keep pushing the theme throughout the level.

859
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,280
Boom, key turning point again.

860
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,383
Just as you're getting fatigued with that item,

861
00:37:17,643 --> 00:37:19,786
we try to give you a new item every 90 to 120 minutes

862
00:37:19,806 --> 00:37:21,468
and so forth and so forth and so forth.

863
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:27,069
And if done correctly, players will start to learn this flow in the back of their head.

864
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:31,370
If there's ever a pacing dip or they feel like maybe they're tired of something,

865
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:37,451
they will be excited and inspired about the next big item or the next big unlock and the next big ability.

866
00:37:38,192 --> 00:37:44,353
The promise of new and cool items also comes with the promise of varied themes and varied scenarios.

867
00:37:44,653 --> 00:37:49,094
Because we've shown you that these new items and abilities give you lots of different gameplay in the different levels,

868
00:37:49,114 --> 00:37:50,054
we hope that you'll enjoy the rest of the video.

869
00:37:50,074 --> 00:37:50,894
And as always, thanks for watching.

870
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:52,663
the flow is motivating.

871
00:37:52,944 --> 00:37:54,966
And most importantly, we can actually

872
00:37:55,146 --> 00:37:58,529
use that motivation to prioritize exploration.

873
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,991
Here's a quick example.

874
00:38:00,752 --> 00:38:02,394
I want you to watch what the player does here

875
00:38:02,854 --> 00:38:03,695
as he boats around.

876
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:08,460
The taste of Vanir magic led him to new forms

877
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,561
of experimentation.

878
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:10,162
Brabam!

879
00:38:10,182 --> 00:38:12,044
New levels of depravity.

880
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:12,985
Look where we are, Brabam.

881
00:38:14,521 --> 00:38:17,883
OK, so in this example, the player is exploring the hub.

882
00:38:17,923 --> 00:38:19,864
They're being correctly taught the shock arrow mechanic.

883
00:38:20,324 --> 00:38:22,525
And thanks to the design work done by Kaizeng,

884
00:38:23,045 --> 00:38:25,266
they've also been told that shock arrows mean

885
00:38:25,326 --> 00:38:26,507
interesting themes and that there's

886
00:38:26,527 --> 00:38:28,388
a lot of different variety and a lot of different gameplay,

887
00:38:28,428 --> 00:38:28,608
right?

888
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:31,529
So we've made a convincing promise to the player.

889
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:33,430
So watch it one more time.

890
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,871
And I want you to watch just what the camera behavior does.

891
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:41,869
The taste of Vanir magic led him to new forms of experimentation.

892
00:38:41,909 --> 00:38:42,369
Brabham!

893
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:44,351
New levels of depravity.

894
00:38:44,431 --> 00:38:45,372
Look where we are, Brabham.

895
00:38:45,812 --> 00:38:46,693
Boom, and there it is.

896
00:38:46,793 --> 00:38:48,054
He saw a shock crystal, right?

897
00:38:48,374 --> 00:38:49,676
He has been taught correctly.

898
00:38:49,916 --> 00:38:52,058
He has been promised interesting gameplay.

899
00:38:52,438 --> 00:38:55,360
And because he is returning to the hub, he is thinking,

900
00:38:55,801 --> 00:38:57,943
oh, I feel like doing one of those.

901
00:38:58,203 --> 00:38:59,224
I know how those work.

902
00:38:59,564 --> 00:39:00,725
I'm in the mood for one of those.

903
00:39:00,845 --> 00:39:02,567
Or he can just explore it on his own.

904
00:39:03,127 --> 00:39:04,168
That is the benefit.

905
00:39:04,957 --> 00:39:08,060
The result is that we do have a compass system,

906
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,902
and we do have a map, right?

907
00:39:10,462 --> 00:39:13,565
But our hope is that players will be self-motivated,

908
00:39:13,825 --> 00:39:16,407
and that self-discovery will drive their exploration

909
00:39:16,508 --> 00:39:16,928
instead.

910
00:39:17,629 --> 00:39:20,491
It's good for players to feel motivated via UI or completion

911
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:21,092
percentages.

912
00:39:21,132 --> 00:39:23,154
These are very valid design techniques and tools.

913
00:39:23,914 --> 00:39:28,479
But it's also good if players are self-motivated because they're actually seeking out interesting content.

914
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:33,724
If this player likes shot crystal scenarios, then he can go and find more of them on his own.

915
00:39:34,445 --> 00:39:40,471
Players are trained that new abilities will be unlocked in the levels, and that in turn, interesting scenarios will be delivered.

916
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:45,976
So the promise becomes more than just completion percentages. The promise becomes interesting scenarios.

917
00:39:47,948 --> 00:39:50,070
And that is pretty much our game's format.

918
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,090
You play the level.

919
00:39:51,511 --> 00:39:52,631
You unlock a new item.

920
00:39:52,951 --> 00:39:54,572
You play a variety of scenarios.

921
00:39:55,153 --> 00:39:56,693
When you return back to the hub, you've

922
00:39:56,713 --> 00:39:57,794
been taught how to use it.

923
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:59,915
You've been made the convincing promise of interesting

924
00:39:59,955 --> 00:40:00,436
gameplay.

925
00:40:00,716 --> 00:40:02,997
You can seek out more of those on your own if you like those

926
00:40:03,037 --> 00:40:05,398
types of scenarios, which most players did, especially in

927
00:40:05,438 --> 00:40:06,299
terms of the shock arrows.

928
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:09,601
And then when you're ready, you can start returning back to

929
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:10,221
the next level.

930
00:40:12,142 --> 00:40:12,322
So.

931
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:16,234
That is why we give players such clear exploration breaks,

932
00:40:16,294 --> 00:40:19,355
and that's why we set up so many expectations leading up

933
00:40:19,395 --> 00:40:20,475
to those exploration breaks.

934
00:40:21,395 --> 00:40:23,796
And now that we have a good, what you might call,

935
00:40:23,836 --> 00:40:26,257
level-to-level flow or level-to-level philosophy,

936
00:40:26,637 --> 00:40:28,637
our last rule details the final tool

937
00:40:28,657 --> 00:40:31,038
we need to sort of tie it all together.

938
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:33,859
It's about creating an overarching layout

939
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:36,140
that can actually emphasize that psychology.

940
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:40,566
The difference between a hub and an open world

941
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:44,329
could maybe be a whole GDC presentation of its own.

942
00:40:44,469 --> 00:40:47,391
There's a lot of different things to dive into there.

943
00:40:48,032 --> 00:40:49,833
But for today, what I want to talk about

944
00:40:49,973 --> 00:40:52,435
is how a hub, through its very physical design,

945
00:40:52,775 --> 00:40:55,497
mirrors the level-to-level flow that I've shown you earlier.

946
00:40:56,198 --> 00:40:58,820
It presents it as a playable layout, is the hope.

947
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:03,185
And the hub is our way of creating information in your head

948
00:41:03,305 --> 00:41:05,447
as to where there's a playground for experimentation

949
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:08,190
and exploration versus where the critical path

950
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,851
will take over and continue the story.

951
00:41:10,752 --> 00:41:13,054
So with that, we're over to rule number six.

952
00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:15,136
Hubs are not open world.

953
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:17,739
Let's start with a quick definition

954
00:41:17,759 --> 00:41:19,260
of what a hub actually is then.

955
00:41:20,281 --> 00:41:23,124
A hub is a centralized location from which spokes emit.

956
00:41:24,058 --> 00:41:27,681
And so while an open world may offer a sprawling simulation

957
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:30,042
or something like that, a hub is actually

958
00:41:30,062 --> 00:41:32,484
a very specific layout, and one that

959
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:33,785
proved very effective for us.

960
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:37,067
Here's a quick image of a hub.

961
00:41:37,568 --> 00:41:38,508
It's a pretty basic one.

962
00:41:39,649 --> 00:41:41,551
And using this and the definition here,

963
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:43,792
you can see that the yellow center

964
00:41:43,952 --> 00:41:45,313
acts as a central location.

965
00:41:46,034 --> 00:41:48,796
The arrows coming out represent the.

966
00:41:50,268 --> 00:41:52,911
represent the spokes, and the blue circles

967
00:41:53,031 --> 00:41:55,814
represent the destinations, or the endpoints.

968
00:41:57,236 --> 00:42:01,120
So a lot of people describe a hub as a wagon wheel.

969
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,902
That's a pretty popular comparison.

970
00:42:03,403 --> 00:42:06,606
And using our definitions, we can

971
00:42:06,626 --> 00:42:09,910
start to run that through quick sanity check, central core.

972
00:42:10,889 --> 00:42:12,532
spokes, and endpoints.

973
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:14,716
Or in level design terms, you could maybe

974
00:42:14,776 --> 00:42:15,838
recontextualize these.

975
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:19,624
And you might call them a centralized site or pathways,

976
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:22,930
and maybe the endpoints are destinations or levels

977
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,132
or dungeons or something like that.

978
00:42:25,406 --> 00:42:27,307
Here's a popular example you're probably aware of,

979
00:42:27,648 --> 00:42:29,809
Shadow of the Colossus, one of the greatest games of all time.

980
00:42:30,449 --> 00:42:33,291
The player always returns back to the Colossus Temple

981
00:42:33,552 --> 00:42:34,432
at the center of the level.

982
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:36,214
Then they start to go exploring.

983
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:39,816
And they find more destinations on their own.

984
00:42:39,856 --> 00:42:42,538
And they're always reverted back to the central location.

985
00:42:43,379 --> 00:42:45,720
In popular culture, Disneyland is probably

986
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,861
the most well-known example.

987
00:42:46,921 --> 00:42:48,482
It has the Mickey Mouse statue in the middle.

988
00:42:48,842 --> 00:42:49,943
You take pathways out.

989
00:42:50,724 --> 00:42:52,885
You find the different lands, as they are called.

990
00:42:53,964 --> 00:42:57,787
It's a very effective and fairly traditional level design technique, right?

991
00:42:57,827 --> 00:43:01,411
And one for us that I think was the perfect canvas for our level-to-level flow.

992
00:43:01,952 --> 00:43:06,676
So, let's take a look at it in a quick example using the Stonemason level.

993
00:43:06,716 --> 00:43:11,982
As you can see here, the temple in the center represents the centralized core.

994
00:43:12,682 --> 00:43:14,204
Coming off this is pathways.

995
00:43:14,544 --> 00:43:16,246
These represent the directional spokes

996
00:43:16,446 --> 00:43:18,308
to which the player can explore and go around.

997
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:20,670
And finally, our levels and our dungeons,

998
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:22,692
they sort of represent the destinations

999
00:43:22,852 --> 00:43:24,814
or the endpoints of the hub-spoke diagram.

1000
00:43:25,735 --> 00:43:28,377
So now we can test it against our hub diagram.

1001
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,719
You can see that's actually pretty familiar,

1002
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:31,741
not just because I matched the colors.

1003
00:43:33,342 --> 00:43:35,224
And remember before, our level-to-level flow,

1004
00:43:35,824 --> 00:43:37,346
you know, establish a theme.

1005
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:41,090
hit a key turning point, earn a new ability or item,

1006
00:43:42,491 --> 00:43:45,393
get a clear exploration break, continue, continue, continue.

1007
00:43:46,594 --> 00:43:49,135
Let's run this against the stonemason level.

1008
00:43:49,976 --> 00:43:52,278
In the previous level, the player goes up to the mountains,

1009
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:54,779
and they use the previous level's mechanic,

1010
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,301
which in this case,

1011
00:43:56,481 --> 00:43:58,642
let's just call it orange to avoid spoilers.

1012
00:44:00,764 --> 00:44:01,724
And they start to use this.

1013
00:44:01,884 --> 00:44:03,566
It also creates a theme throughout the level.

1014
00:44:03,606 --> 00:44:04,907
They hit a capitulation point,

1015
00:44:04,987 --> 00:44:06,528
and they are rewarded with the shock arrow

1016
00:44:06,668 --> 00:44:07,368
at the end of this level.

1017
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,250
The player can now make their way back to the hub.

1018
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:13,312
Having confidently been taught how to use the shock arrow,

1019
00:44:13,332 --> 00:44:15,434
they can now choose to explore with it if they want.

1020
00:44:16,234 --> 00:44:17,075
And then when they're ready,

1021
00:44:17,835 --> 00:44:20,237
they can explore back for a quick narrative beat.

1022
00:44:20,277 --> 00:44:22,419
There's a sort of mini mission that takes place here,

1023
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:22,979
a mini level.

1024
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:25,461
And when they're ready to go to the main critical path level,

1025
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:27,322
they head back to the stonemason level.

1026
00:44:27,763 --> 00:44:30,284
We drive that theme all the way through the level,

1027
00:44:30,385 --> 00:44:32,166
create a lot of variety, a lot more pacing,

1028
00:44:32,526 --> 00:44:33,887
increase the complexity a little bit

1029
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:35,228
of the shock arrow scenarios.

1030
00:44:35,788 --> 00:44:38,450
Boom, just as you're getting fatigued, key turning point,

1031
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:41,132
new ability or item, teach you three scenarios,

1032
00:44:41,593 --> 00:44:42,873
and then you're back to the hub.

1033
00:44:44,475 --> 00:44:46,016
And as we strip all of this away,

1034
00:44:46,096 --> 00:44:49,818
it becomes apparent that this layout is very similar

1035
00:44:49,918 --> 00:44:50,939
to the big wagon wheel.

1036
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:53,581
Overall, I believe the Lake of Nine

1037
00:44:53,741 --> 00:44:55,963
was great at delivering the goals of a hub.

1038
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:59,265
And it's this hub design that, in turn,

1039
00:44:59,365 --> 00:45:01,246
is really successful at achieving

1040
00:45:01,306 --> 00:45:03,568
the sort of Metroidvania element that people often

1041
00:45:03,908 --> 00:45:05,029
enjoy in this game.

1042
00:45:06,147 --> 00:45:08,012
So there's your hope.

1043
00:45:09,255 --> 00:45:11,221
And with that, we're back to our rule slide.

1044
00:45:11,261 --> 00:45:12,103
I'll add it to the annex.

1045
00:45:13,484 --> 00:45:15,446
Let's go through all of these, and I'll quickly recap.

1046
00:45:16,026 --> 00:45:18,628
It's also a good time to mention that these are actually

1047
00:45:19,229 --> 00:45:21,570
sometimes really good design priorities.

1048
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:24,713
As you step through a really big project or a lot of work,

1049
00:45:25,954 --> 00:45:27,315
you can also start to think of these

1050
00:45:27,395 --> 00:45:29,757
as maybe the order of operations that you might want to take

1051
00:45:29,857 --> 00:45:31,198
experiences on in a game.

1052
00:45:31,698 --> 00:45:34,040
Up front is just about how we start to think together

1053
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,362
and how we work together to start creating some focus

1054
00:45:36,562 --> 00:45:39,784
as a design group, whether that's technically designers

1055
00:45:39,824 --> 00:45:41,366
or just people who we work with.

1056
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:47,811
Rule number two represents our desire to represent those core pillars as metrics. How are we going to construct?

1057
00:45:48,251 --> 00:45:55,758
Effectively and consistently amongst one another rules three and four it's all about the backbone of creativity and the backbone of variety and pacing

1058
00:45:56,198 --> 00:46:03,004
Rule five ensures that we have clear exploration breaks and and that levels flow clearly from one another and finally our newest rule number six

1059
00:46:03,144 --> 00:46:09,189
It's sort of an overarching wrapper or an overarching layout for the whole experience and with that we have a game

1060
00:46:10,387 --> 00:46:12,848
But since it's GDC, and since we're

1061
00:46:12,868 --> 00:46:15,550
here to learn about the tricky nature of development,

1062
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:16,891
I'll now step back through all of these

1063
00:46:16,931 --> 00:46:17,851
and show you where they all broke.

1064
00:46:20,793 --> 00:46:22,774
And not just because there was bad design,

1065
00:46:22,814 --> 00:46:24,155
or not just because something was wrong.

1066
00:46:24,476 --> 00:46:26,777
Sometimes it's also an opportunity.

1067
00:46:27,057 --> 00:46:30,299
Sometimes maybe a problem just didn't work out

1068
00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:33,121
the way we expected, or sometimes it's just common sense.

1069
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:35,463
So here's rule number one.

1070
00:46:36,478 --> 00:46:39,681
What you might have noticed is that this game has a lot of puzzles,

1071
00:46:40,201 --> 00:46:44,043
and puzzles are not represented anywhere in the core pillars of the game.

1072
00:46:44,724 --> 00:46:45,324
So what's the deal?

1073
00:46:45,825 --> 00:46:47,786
Are puzzles a core pillar or not, right?

1074
00:46:48,186 --> 00:46:50,788
And this is a question that took us about four and a half years to work out.

1075
00:46:52,287 --> 00:46:54,128
So even though the puzzles take a lot of work,

1076
00:46:54,188 --> 00:46:56,168
and even though they do take a lot of play testing,

1077
00:46:56,268 --> 00:46:57,969
they're a great addition to the game

1078
00:46:58,429 --> 00:47:01,289
because they let us tap into the three pillars of the game

1079
00:47:01,709 --> 00:47:02,630
in really great ways.

1080
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:05,690
I like to look at the puzzles in terms of sort of

1081
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:08,071
emphasizers or subcategories

1082
00:47:08,311 --> 00:47:10,031
of combat narrative and exploration.

1083
00:47:10,531 --> 00:47:11,432
As I mentioned earlier,

1084
00:47:11,532 --> 00:47:12,992
puzzles are great for just slowing down

1085
00:47:13,012 --> 00:47:13,912
the action in general,

1086
00:47:13,952 --> 00:47:16,093
so we can get a lot of narrative between the characters.

1087
00:47:17,833 --> 00:47:20,054
There's a lot more father-son teamwork in a puzzle,

1088
00:47:20,134 --> 00:47:21,994
so that can be a good way to emphasize that pillar.

1089
00:47:23,015 --> 00:47:26,257
In terms of exploration, puzzles often make us rethink the space,

1090
00:47:26,277 --> 00:47:28,078
so they keep us in the space a little bit longer.

1091
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:32,141
At Santa Monica Studios, we truly do have some of the best environment artists in the world,

1092
00:47:32,161 --> 00:47:36,244
so we're always looking for ways to get the player to soak in the space just a little bit more

1093
00:47:36,625 --> 00:47:39,226
and try to appreciate the spaces, not blow through them too quickly.

1094
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:42,729
And finally, for combat, the puzzles actually teach you to learn.

1095
00:47:42,889 --> 00:47:44,390
I'll show you one more time this scenario.

1096
00:47:45,649 --> 00:47:47,651
This one is early in the game, and it's actually

1097
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,973
tuned a little bit difficult.

1098
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:49,754
Why?

1099
00:47:50,454 --> 00:47:52,797
Because we would rather that you fail on the scenario

1100
00:47:52,817 --> 00:47:55,860
a couple of times and learn how to throw the axe more

1101
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:57,482
effectively, so that when you step

1102
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,404
into the more complex scenarios in the game,

1103
00:47:59,805 --> 00:48:01,487
you have trained yourself how to do something that

1104
00:48:01,947 --> 00:48:03,709
doesn't really exist in any other game.

1105
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:06,092
Throwing an axe and recalling it is fairly abstract.

1106
00:48:06,152 --> 00:48:07,593
It's something that makes this game unique.

1107
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:10,416
And so by tuning this puzzle just a bit difficult,

1108
00:48:10,456 --> 00:48:13,880
we can be guaranteed that the types of players

1109
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,944
who will engage with stretch content or more complex content

1110
00:48:17,964 --> 00:48:20,427
are also the types of players who might train and master.

1111
00:48:21,628 --> 00:48:22,809
more complex mechanics.

1112
00:48:23,169 --> 00:48:24,589
So in short, puzzles are a big part of the game,

1113
00:48:24,609 --> 00:48:25,370
but they're not a core pillar.

1114
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,451
Number two, we are a metrics-based game.

1115
00:48:29,212 --> 00:48:32,193
So the Norse landscape itself is really organic

1116
00:48:32,253 --> 00:48:34,134
and really mysterious, and that was one thing

1117
00:48:34,154 --> 00:48:36,175
that was very obvious to us from day one.

1118
00:48:37,076 --> 00:48:39,036
But metrics are actually really rigid,

1119
00:48:39,357 --> 00:48:40,377
and they're deliberately so.

1120
00:48:40,497 --> 00:48:43,539
So how do you kind of tie these things together?

1121
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:45,460
There's a natural conflict that emerges, right?

1122
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:47,781
So here's a quick example of where it broke.

1123
00:48:48,613 --> 00:48:50,314
I've shown you my favorite example, which

1124
00:48:50,374 --> 00:48:51,375
is the 3-meter boost.

1125
00:48:51,896 --> 00:48:53,357
And on the right-hand side, you can

1126
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,038
see that there's a lot of debris or shrub.

1127
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,001
So in the test bed, it looks great.

1128
00:48:58,421 --> 00:49:01,303
You can see that it's a very clear perpendicular object.

1129
00:49:01,384 --> 00:49:02,885
It's kind of turreted in this example,

1130
00:49:02,925 --> 00:49:04,446
so we can accentuate the nature of it.

1131
00:49:04,947 --> 00:49:06,588
But by the time we put debris over it,

1132
00:49:06,668 --> 00:49:09,931
it sort of loses its ability to be an architectural piece.

1133
00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:12,150
What now?

1134
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:13,210
What are we going to do?

1135
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:14,991
Get mad at each other, blame each other,

1136
00:49:15,251 --> 00:49:17,532
scream at each other, go into each other's files,

1137
00:49:17,592 --> 00:49:18,073
pull out shrubs?

1138
00:49:18,293 --> 00:49:18,553
No.

1139
00:49:19,573 --> 00:49:21,634
What we actually did is come up with a style guide.

1140
00:49:22,114 --> 00:49:23,835
This indicates where shrubs and debris

1141
00:49:23,855 --> 00:49:27,577
should actually be placed and where design metrics need

1142
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:30,198
to be kept important to keep things clear.

1143
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:32,860
Fortunately, we have an environment team

1144
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,002
who is extraordinarily talented and very

1145
00:49:35,062 --> 00:49:36,163
passionate about the game.

1146
00:49:36,663 --> 00:49:38,965
And you might think that pitching to a team, hey,

1147
00:49:38,985 --> 00:49:41,167
we're going to talk about rules for shrub placement

1148
00:49:41,207 --> 00:49:44,229
or where shrubs can't go might be the most boring conversation

1149
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:44,469
ever.

1150
00:49:44,489 --> 00:49:46,510
But actually, everyone really rallied together

1151
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:48,832
to talk about how we could create a style guide

1152
00:49:48,872 --> 00:49:49,333
for shrubs.

1153
00:49:49,773 --> 00:49:51,955
And the net result is that shrubs and debris

1154
00:49:51,995 --> 00:49:54,356
can actually be used not only to, uh,

1155
00:49:58,732 --> 00:50:01,134
When they're removed, they not only make spaces very clear,

1156
00:50:01,434 --> 00:50:02,835
but if you put them in certain places,

1157
00:50:02,855 --> 00:50:04,817
they can actually act as a deterrent as well.

1158
00:50:05,117 --> 00:50:07,679
So by creating these two style guide rules,

1159
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:14,283
we could actually basically create organic placement,

1160
00:50:14,424 --> 00:50:15,905
where we didn't want you to go,

1161
00:50:16,345 --> 00:50:17,526
and architectural placement,

1162
00:50:17,566 --> 00:50:19,087
where we wanted to emphasize you going.

1163
00:50:19,507 --> 00:50:21,669
So there's a lot of positive and negative

1164
00:50:21,849 --> 00:50:23,770
visual expectations that you can actually create.

1165
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,529
Also, what about rules 3 and 4?

1166
00:50:27,569 --> 00:50:28,029
Variety.

1167
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:29,250
All levels have a theme, right?

1168
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:31,750
Not in the back 25% of this game.

1169
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,551
I'm not going to spoil anything for you,

1170
00:50:33,651 --> 00:50:35,231
but the reason is twofold.

1171
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:36,111
What's the deal?

1172
00:50:36,171 --> 00:50:37,712
Did you run out of money again?

1173
00:50:37,812 --> 00:50:38,912
Did you run out of ideas?

1174
00:50:38,972 --> 00:50:40,833
Was four years too long to make a game?

1175
00:50:40,853 --> 00:50:42,713
Do you not want to go to five or six?

1176
00:50:42,853 --> 00:50:42,973
No.

1177
00:50:43,494 --> 00:50:45,497
We don't have an unlimited budget on features,

1178
00:50:45,677 --> 00:50:48,301
and we do try to use them as effectively as possible.

1179
00:50:48,461 --> 00:50:50,284
And when we started to paper plan the game,

1180
00:50:50,724 --> 00:50:52,687
we did realize that we were going to run out of mechanics

1181
00:50:52,707 --> 00:50:54,309
and that we didn't have an unlimited budget

1182
00:50:54,330 --> 00:50:57,534
and that we didn't want to spend forever just prototyping

1183
00:50:57,594 --> 00:50:57,975
and whatever.

1184
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:01,956
The back part of the game are really more about mastery

1185
00:51:02,196 --> 00:51:03,056
than about newness.

1186
00:51:04,256 --> 00:51:07,617
Keep in mind all of the level theming that I mentioned earlier,

1187
00:51:07,977 --> 00:51:10,778
it's not specifically about creating new items all the time,

1188
00:51:10,838 --> 00:51:11,978
it's about creating variety.

1189
00:51:12,538 --> 00:51:14,198
There is more ways to create variety

1190
00:51:14,258 --> 00:51:16,118
than just adding more mechanics to the game.

1191
00:51:16,839 --> 00:51:17,759
Here's a quick example.

1192
00:51:18,579 --> 00:51:21,219
The Temple Flip level towards the end of the game is often,

1193
00:51:21,299 --> 00:51:23,200
oops, sorry, let me get that up for you.

1194
00:51:29,765 --> 00:51:30,465
Oh no.

1195
00:51:32,867 --> 00:51:34,508
Well, the Tempo Flip level of the game

1196
00:51:34,628 --> 00:51:37,030
is actually often described as final exam.

1197
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,652
And what that means is that it uses

1198
00:51:39,872 --> 00:51:42,554
all the previous level mechanics of the game together.

1199
00:51:43,815 --> 00:51:46,958
And so let me get this back up and running.

1200
00:51:47,038 --> 00:51:48,018
I think we crashed.

1201
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,301
Oh, there we go.

1202
00:51:51,321 --> 00:51:51,361
OK.

1203
00:51:56,597 --> 00:51:59,278
So in this example, it's the only time in the game

1204
00:51:59,618 --> 00:52:02,479
where Crusher Trap and Shock Arrow are used together.

1205
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:06,141
The reason for this is that the Crusher Trap is a one-hit KO.

1206
00:52:06,681 --> 00:52:08,902
And so when we combine these two things together,

1207
00:52:09,282 --> 00:52:11,543
there is a different emotion and more variety

1208
00:52:11,743 --> 00:52:13,504
established through the combination of those two

1209
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:13,904
elements.

1210
00:52:14,524 --> 00:52:16,225
So the deeper the player gets into the game,

1211
00:52:16,545 --> 00:52:17,785
the more they know about the game,

1212
00:52:17,825 --> 00:52:20,386
and the more you can promote challenge, strategy,

1213
00:52:20,506 --> 00:52:22,327
and metagaming through the existing mechanics.

1214
00:52:22,767 --> 00:52:25,048
And the net result is still interesting gameplay, right?

1215
00:52:25,088 --> 00:52:25,908
It's still variety.

1216
00:52:27,573 --> 00:52:29,796
Finally, I'll keep this one really quick.

1217
00:52:30,536 --> 00:52:32,138
Once we had good level-to-level flow,

1218
00:52:32,298 --> 00:52:34,560
players were still not really understanding,

1219
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:36,682
or certain players were still not really understanding where

1220
00:52:36,702 --> 00:52:38,104
they could and couldn't explore.

1221
00:52:38,865 --> 00:52:40,887
And we believed pretty strongly from a level design

1222
00:52:40,927 --> 00:52:42,668
perspective that the hub was the right way to go,

1223
00:52:42,688 --> 00:52:44,010
that we'd done all the right work,

1224
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,771
and that we'd created a good, overarching format.

1225
00:52:46,252 --> 00:52:47,453
But some players just really needed

1226
00:52:47,473 --> 00:52:49,655
to be hit over the head that they could explore.

1227
00:52:49,695 --> 00:52:51,117
They needed that final confirmation.

1228
00:52:51,737 --> 00:52:53,758
So to solve this, we collaborated with the writers

1229
00:52:54,519 --> 00:52:56,640
so that whenever the player re-enters the hub,

1230
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,961
they're given an additional line of dialogue

1231
00:52:59,281 --> 00:53:01,542
from Kratos and Atreus, indicating that it

1232
00:53:01,582 --> 00:53:02,923
might be a good time to explore.

1233
00:53:03,883 --> 00:53:06,484
You can actually see here that whenever they step

1234
00:53:06,504 --> 00:53:09,146
through these two doors, they'll get a little line of dialogue,

1235
00:53:09,166 --> 00:53:11,487
and they'll say something like, hey, maybe we

1236
00:53:11,507 --> 00:53:13,148
should go exploring right now.

1237
00:53:13,248 --> 00:53:13,968
What do you think, Dad?

1238
00:53:14,528 --> 00:53:15,249
But the thing is.

1239
00:53:16,315 --> 00:53:18,757
We had to write them so many times so that it was never

1240
00:53:18,957 --> 00:53:20,398
mandating the player to do so.

1241
00:53:20,778 --> 00:53:22,259
And so with some of these things,

1242
00:53:22,379 --> 00:53:24,581
it really does come down to play testing and trying

1243
00:53:24,621 --> 00:53:26,582
a variety of different lines and trying

1244
00:53:26,602 --> 00:53:28,404
a different group of reads.

1245
00:53:29,885 --> 00:53:31,886
Finally, hubs are not open worlds.

1246
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:34,588
Well, one interesting conflict here

1247
00:53:34,848 --> 00:53:37,410
is whether we needed to align too much to the purity

1248
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:38,811
of a wheel-spoke format.

1249
00:53:38,831 --> 00:53:40,693
Let's take a look at it one more time.

1250
00:53:40,733 --> 00:53:43,395
You can see here that the hub-spoke is a literal circle.

1251
00:53:44,948 --> 00:53:45,969
which is great on paper.

1252
00:53:46,109 --> 00:53:48,130
It gives us a very clear understanding

1253
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:49,310
of how it's meant to work.

1254
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:50,791
It's a very clear design trope.

1255
00:53:51,051 --> 00:53:52,772
It's very clear on what we're trying to deliver.

1256
00:53:53,412 --> 00:53:55,733
But as you can see, the pure nature of a circle

1257
00:53:55,793 --> 00:53:57,574
doesn't really give the environment team

1258
00:53:57,994 --> 00:53:59,955
much wiggle room to deliver on the fantasy

1259
00:53:59,975 --> 00:54:02,336
of a fabulous Norse lush landscape, right?

1260
00:54:02,916 --> 00:54:05,497
So what we have to consider is, can we deliver on a hub

1261
00:54:05,898 --> 00:54:07,778
if the elements are made a bit more organic?

1262
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,700
This is what it would look like if it was a pure circle.

1263
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,281
And this is kind of what it ended up like.

1264
00:54:14,581 --> 00:54:16,762
So you have to start wondering, once we've

1265
00:54:16,782 --> 00:54:22,365
got this structural center and we have these pathways which

1266
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:25,267
are retained very clearly, how else can we

1267
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:27,788
accentuate the hub-like nature while also delivering

1268
00:54:27,828 --> 00:54:28,429
on the organics?

1269
00:54:28,909 --> 00:54:31,130
And the answer was that all around the Lake of Nine,

1270
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:32,571
there's these additional towers.

1271
00:54:32,991 --> 00:54:35,593
And even though they may not necessarily

1272
00:54:35,653 --> 00:54:38,234
create a pure circle, per se, in terms of a barrier,

1273
00:54:38,514 --> 00:54:40,836
they do help to create an additional anchor that

1274
00:54:40,876 --> 00:54:41,996
helps us emphasize the hub.

1275
00:54:42,617 --> 00:54:44,378
So even though the level itself became more organic,

1276
00:54:44,398 --> 00:54:46,439
there's still enough hub-like elements

1277
00:54:46,479 --> 00:54:48,420
that we can retain the core design intent

1278
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,441
while also supporting the needs of the environment art team.

1279
00:54:54,283 --> 00:54:54,423
So.

1280
00:54:55,563 --> 00:54:57,544
I mentioned at the top of the presentation

1281
00:54:57,584 --> 00:55:00,026
that this project actually did have a lot of risks, right?

1282
00:55:00,747 --> 00:55:02,408
And even though from a technical standpoint,

1283
00:55:02,468 --> 00:55:03,809
areas like the Lake of Nine, which

1284
00:55:03,849 --> 00:55:07,111
was created and led by Luis Sanchez and John Palamarchuk,

1285
00:55:07,551 --> 00:55:09,092
they worked on it for a long time.

1286
00:55:09,132 --> 00:55:13,075
And it was a huge technical task to get it up and running.

1287
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:15,757
But the nice thing about some of these design rules

1288
00:55:15,817 --> 00:55:18,339
is that they're pretty easy for us to understand and get

1289
00:55:18,379 --> 00:55:18,979
excited about.

1290
00:55:18,999 --> 00:55:20,220
They're mostly what I would consider

1291
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,741
to be design classics.

1292
00:55:22,161 --> 00:55:23,562
They're not that fancy.

1293
00:55:24,177 --> 00:55:25,877
You can see how having a unique item

1294
00:55:25,977 --> 00:55:27,398
and a lot of variety in each level

1295
00:55:27,458 --> 00:55:29,558
is going to drive themes and make things fun, right?

1296
00:55:30,779 --> 00:55:32,639
You can see how having a hub will be a good,

1297
00:55:32,739 --> 00:55:35,780
overarching wrapper to a game and to an exploration experience.

1298
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,761
And that's why sometimes going with a design classic

1299
00:55:39,021 --> 00:55:39,781
is really great.

1300
00:55:40,341 --> 00:55:41,822
Amongst all the technical challenges

1301
00:55:41,882 --> 00:55:43,342
or additional creative challenges

1302
00:55:43,402 --> 00:55:44,563
that we're trying to solve together,

1303
00:55:44,963 --> 00:55:47,404
a design classic can sort of let you predict head a little bit.

1304
00:55:47,744 --> 00:55:49,784
You're confident that it's going to come together,

1305
00:55:50,144 --> 00:55:51,445
and you can focus a little bit more

1306
00:55:51,505 --> 00:55:52,625
on the day-over-day challenges.

1307
00:55:53,607 --> 00:55:56,309
So if I can leave you with one kind of wrap-up thought,

1308
00:55:56,489 --> 00:55:56,829
it's this.

1309
00:55:57,569 --> 00:55:58,630
I love a design classic.

1310
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,852
They let you create foundation.

1311
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:02,293
They're awesome.

1312
00:56:02,533 --> 00:56:03,514
They give you structure.

1313
00:56:03,574 --> 00:56:05,836
They give you canvas, all the building blocks for a game.

1314
00:56:07,076 --> 00:56:08,898
But they are pretty much just that.

1315
00:56:09,618 --> 00:56:11,420
From there, it's really over to the team

1316
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,861
and over to creativity and over to variety.

1317
00:56:14,362 --> 00:56:16,083
You do need a strong foundation, and you

1318
00:56:16,123 --> 00:56:17,604
do need a strong design canvas.

1319
00:56:17,944 --> 00:56:20,766
But a canvas is not inherently interesting on its own.

1320
00:56:21,227 --> 00:56:22,588
So I'll leave you with one final rule.

1321
00:56:23,843 --> 00:56:25,945
Because the thing that elevates a design canvas

1322
00:56:26,005 --> 00:56:28,366
into an actual experience is a lot of creators

1323
00:56:28,466 --> 00:56:29,827
coming together to add texture.

1324
00:56:31,207 --> 00:56:31,488
Thank you.

1325
00:56:31,508 --> 00:56:42,814
I think we have a couple of quick minutes.

1326
00:56:43,234 --> 00:56:47,636
And I will mention at this point, we are hiring.

1327
00:56:47,857 --> 00:56:49,898
And we're trying to make a really big game again.

1328
00:56:51,657 --> 00:56:54,820
In some form or another, we're always excited about new people joining the team.

1329
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,942
And they're not all from huge AAA backgrounds.

1330
00:56:56,982 --> 00:56:58,904
A lot of people come from different backgrounds.

1331
00:56:59,805 --> 00:57:00,005
Yes?

1332
00:57:01,367 --> 00:57:01,627
Hi.

1333
00:57:02,508 --> 00:57:04,470
So, one comment, one question.

1334
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:07,293
I liked how you kept coming back to the six rules card.

1335
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:09,996
That was inherently your hub in this presentation.

1336
00:57:10,016 --> 00:57:10,336
Thank you.

1337
00:57:11,618 --> 00:57:13,059
And then the second, the question is,

1338
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:14,681
and you kind of spoke about this at the end.

1339
00:57:15,613 --> 00:57:21,858
But there was a very clear format for introducing new items, new abilities, and then carrying them forward.

1340
00:57:21,958 --> 00:57:27,664
But could you speak a little bit about how you brought items, like legacy items,

1341
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:31,748
essentially that you'd already taught earlier in the game, and brought them back later in the game type thing?

1342
00:57:32,706 --> 00:57:37,568
Yes, wherever possible, we try to make sure that the level has an overarching theme,

1343
00:57:37,728 --> 00:57:39,869
but it should never come at the cost of additional variety.

1344
00:57:39,929 --> 00:57:43,611
So mixing and matching previous levels mechanics, as long as they're taught correctly,

1345
00:57:43,931 --> 00:57:46,452
and as long as we have confidence that the player knows how to use them,

1346
00:57:46,732 --> 00:57:50,214
again, you can create a lot of variety by mixing and matching those correctly.

1347
00:57:50,614 --> 00:57:53,916
So for example, Atreus and his rules are taught very early in the game,

1348
00:57:54,196 --> 00:57:57,698
and those are leveraged all the way through the course of the game with additional mechanics.

1349
00:57:57,878 --> 00:57:59,078
Okay, cool. Thank you.

1350
00:57:59,298 --> 00:57:59,438
Yeah.

1351
00:58:02,352 --> 00:58:04,234
Oh, let's go with the left side, maybe.

1352
00:58:05,596 --> 00:58:06,337
OK.

1353
00:58:06,877 --> 00:58:08,519
So I was wondering, actually, when

1354
00:58:08,539 --> 00:58:10,541
you mentioned that you use metrics

1355
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:13,745
as a rule for the level design, did you also

1356
00:58:14,025 --> 00:58:17,288
support it with analytics or some sort of thing like that?

1357
00:58:17,408 --> 00:58:20,472
Or was it more like general metrical guidelines, really,

1358
00:58:20,552 --> 00:58:21,313
for level design?

1359
00:58:21,938 --> 00:58:27,362
Yeah, we use a few Maya tools, for example, for the slopes to detect whether something is actually to metric or not.

1360
00:58:27,902 --> 00:58:33,025
For the most part, it is down to the taste of the designer and the environment artists to stick to the rules.

1361
00:58:34,006 --> 00:58:37,969
If the game comes up with bugs, you'll know why, because it probably didn't hit the metrics.

1362
00:58:38,529 --> 00:58:43,793
And the analytics are mostly used for player feedback and for combat tuning, testing, economy,

1363
00:58:43,973 --> 00:58:48,336
and sort of more broader reaching things that are harder for us to test with our hands.

1364
00:58:49,036 --> 00:58:49,697
Gotcha. Thanks.

1365
00:58:49,937 --> 00:58:50,037
Yeah.

1366
00:58:50,929 --> 00:58:51,910
Hi, thanks for the talk.

1367
00:58:53,751 --> 00:58:55,952
I'm sorry if I spoiled this for someone.

1368
00:58:57,193 --> 00:59:02,075
You talked about the central hub at a horizontal level,

1369
00:59:02,115 --> 00:59:05,457
but one of the particularities of that central hub

1370
00:59:05,637 --> 00:59:07,498
is that it's also vertical.

1371
00:59:07,558 --> 00:59:08,799
It has a lot of verticality,

1372
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,641
and I wonder if you could elaborate

1373
00:59:11,701 --> 00:59:14,542
on what went into designing

1374
00:59:14,562 --> 00:59:17,764
that sort of like water temple-ish theme.

1375
00:59:19,232 --> 00:59:24,955
Yes, very early on part of the fantasy of the lake of nine was that it would be a double-stacked hub and

1376
00:59:24,975 --> 00:59:30,718
That was a very early decision because as you're alluding to it's a huge amount of design work to plan for that and to account

1377
00:59:30,758 --> 00:59:34,359
For that so I wouldn't necessarily recommend retrofitting it at the last second

1378
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:37,761
Because we didn't and it was thought about for a very long time

1379
00:59:37,881 --> 00:59:41,323
There were many experiments and prototypes in terms of the content

1380
00:59:41,823 --> 00:59:46,865
There's an overarching rule that it should be fun at level one and fun at level two, but for different reasons

1381
00:59:47,365 --> 00:59:49,887
So at level one, it's more about the questing experience

1382
00:59:50,507 --> 00:59:52,628
and reminding you how to fight,

1383
00:59:52,908 --> 00:59:54,989
teaching you the ropes of exploration in the game.

1384
00:59:55,309 --> 00:59:57,990
And at level two, as I mentioned, it's more about mastery.

1385
00:59:58,311 --> 00:59:59,771
And it's some of the more difficult puzzles

1386
00:59:59,811 --> 01:00:01,512
and difficult scenarios in the game.

1387
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:03,833
Since they're optional, that's great for us

1388
01:00:03,853 --> 01:00:05,434
because a lot of the designers actually love

1389
01:00:05,474 --> 01:00:07,095
building those more complex scenarios.

1390
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:10,036
So it was a perfect opportunity to put complexity

1391
01:00:10,256 --> 01:00:13,698
with optional drive matched together.

1392
01:00:14,218 --> 01:00:14,898
Thank you. Yeah.

1393
01:00:16,612 --> 01:00:16,792
Yes.

1394
01:00:17,933 --> 01:00:23,916
So, you mentioned that you introduced a new mechanic or ability about 90 minutes or 2

1395
01:00:24,456 --> 01:00:25,437
hours, something like that.

1396
01:00:26,077 --> 01:00:30,960
I was just wondering how do you make it so a player doesn't get bored of it?

1397
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,523
Because a lot of times I've seen many games that you get a new ability and players just

1398
01:00:35,563 --> 01:00:39,926
like that half an hour and they're all, okay, what's next?

1399
01:00:40,566 --> 01:00:40,766
Right.

1400
01:00:41,927 --> 01:00:43,088
I think that's a great takeaway.

1401
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:46,909
Goal should not be to come up with more mechanics.

1402
01:00:47,409 --> 01:00:49,071
If you run into that problem, the goal

1403
01:00:49,091 --> 01:00:50,631
should be to evaluate whether you've created

1404
01:00:50,692 --> 01:00:52,012
enough interesting scenarios.

1405
01:00:52,373 --> 01:00:54,314
So as I showed you earlier, even just

1406
01:00:54,354 --> 01:00:55,955
inside the pillar of combat, there's

1407
01:00:55,975 --> 01:00:58,276
a lot of different versatility you can create inside that.

1408
01:00:58,576 --> 01:01:01,038
If you're willing to add a timer to something or a depth

1409
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:03,840
to something, you can take a look at that mechanic

1410
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:06,441
and start to think, what vectors have we not utilized

1411
01:01:06,481 --> 01:01:07,282
this mechanic for already?

1412
01:01:07,302 --> 01:01:08,082
And if players are saying they're bored,

1413
01:01:08,102 --> 01:01:08,843
you can take a look at that mechanic

1414
01:01:08,863 --> 01:01:09,983
and start to think, what vectors have we not utilized

1415
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:15,652
It might be the mechanic, but it might also be that the scenarios aren't pushing the player's brain in enough different directions, right?

1416
01:01:16,092 --> 01:01:16,793
Okay, thank you.

1417
01:01:17,074 --> 01:01:17,214
Yeah.

1418
01:01:19,036 --> 01:01:19,958
Hi, thank you for the talk.

1419
01:01:21,258 --> 01:01:27,203
One thing that was quite amazing in God of War was the fact that the collectible placement.

1420
01:01:27,503 --> 01:01:30,346
When I was looking for them, I couldn't find any.

1421
01:01:30,626 --> 01:01:35,010
And when I stopped looking for them, I usually ended up having 100% completion of levels.

1422
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:40,975
And it felt like you had a really keen understanding of the player psychology, what they were going to look at.

1423
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:45,018
And could you elaborate on the processes that come with that?

1424
01:01:45,298 --> 01:01:47,160
When did you add it?

1425
01:01:48,589 --> 01:01:51,231
the collectibles, where you're looking at playtest

1426
01:01:51,311 --> 01:01:52,992
and things like that.

1427
01:01:53,232 --> 01:01:54,372
Any collectibles in particular?

1428
01:01:54,733 --> 01:01:55,653
Ravens, mostly.

1429
01:01:55,853 --> 01:01:56,173
Which ones?

1430
01:01:56,454 --> 01:01:56,834
Ravens.

1431
01:01:57,654 --> 01:01:58,155
Oh, ravens.

1432
01:01:59,595 --> 01:02:01,497
Okay, I would say, put simply,

1433
01:02:01,657 --> 01:02:04,158
for some of the more bespoke collectibles,

1434
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:06,800
hmm, how can I describe it?

1435
01:02:07,742 --> 01:02:10,844
The game rewards players who explore by beating the curve.

1436
01:02:11,824 --> 01:02:13,185
The game is not so huge.

1437
01:02:13,245 --> 01:02:15,746
It looks bigger than it is if you actually look at the geo.

1438
01:02:16,186 --> 01:02:18,107
So by circling around the space a lot,

1439
01:02:18,527 --> 01:02:20,728
you may feel like you're discovering it on your own.

1440
01:02:20,808 --> 01:02:23,070
But more likely scenario is that you've just

1441
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:24,710
gone past that area a lot of times

1442
01:02:24,770 --> 01:02:26,511
or that you'd stumbled across it a little bit.

1443
01:02:27,031 --> 01:02:28,772
So for example, the language disks.

1444
01:02:30,033 --> 01:02:32,314
Most players feel like they discover them on their own,

1445
01:02:32,594 --> 01:02:34,715
and players who go exploring will discover them.

1446
01:02:35,255 --> 01:02:38,956
But there's an additional set in the critical path levels

1447
01:02:39,357 --> 01:02:40,797
for players who didn't go exploring,

1448
01:02:41,217 --> 01:02:43,078
and both groups of players will still stumble

1449
01:02:43,138 --> 01:02:45,579
across those advanced collectibles together.

1450
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:47,700
For the runes, it's a little bit more complicated,

1451
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,120
but I hope I've given you enough to go on.

1452
01:02:49,501 --> 01:02:50,081
Okay, thanks.

1453
01:02:52,422 --> 01:02:54,763
Yeah, I think, one more from each side, yeah.

1454
01:02:56,677 --> 01:02:59,038
In the level design process, I know it's really important,

1455
01:02:59,378 --> 01:03:01,499
especially in a game like this, you have a heavy combat side,

1456
01:03:01,539 --> 01:03:03,661
but you also have to really balance it out with puzzles,

1457
01:03:05,201 --> 01:03:06,222
puzzles with the characters.

1458
01:03:06,542 --> 01:03:10,324
At what point is it you really went combat first really heavy

1459
01:03:10,384 --> 01:03:11,865
and then you said, well, let's think about the puzzles,

1460
01:03:12,366 --> 01:03:13,786
or did you immediately say,

1461
01:03:13,826 --> 01:03:15,427
we have to think about both evenly?

1462
01:03:15,447 --> 01:03:17,048
And what was that process like for the team?

1463
01:03:17,922 --> 01:03:25,588
Great question. One of the solutions to this in the game was the triple chests, as they're called, or the Nornir chests.

1464
01:03:26,949 --> 01:03:34,555
They are a terrific addition to the game because they don't impact the layouts or the environment art the way, like, a full room scenario would,

1465
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:42,682
and they let us look back at things that were maybe previously combat spaces that might not have as much adventuring or exploration in there as we'd like,

1466
01:03:43,382 --> 01:03:45,524
and they were a particularly good way to sort of...

1467
01:03:46,245 --> 01:03:49,607
bring the balance together in areas that were sort of maybe mismatched.

1468
01:03:51,289 --> 01:03:56,893
Hi, so I was curious, given the way that hubs work and how shared the mechanics were across

1469
01:03:56,933 --> 01:04:02,917
many of the levels, how difficult did that make pivoting in the design and direction for levels?

1470
01:04:03,718 --> 01:04:05,959
Like were there any special challenges with that?

1471
01:04:07,887 --> 01:04:13,212
Yes, and I would say that Santa Monica Studios is one studio where we value the environment

1472
01:04:13,332 --> 01:04:16,655
art very highly and the workflow environment artists very highly.

1473
01:04:16,996 --> 01:04:20,419
So that decision to make a hub was extraordinarily early in the project.

1474
01:04:20,459 --> 01:04:24,783
There were other different models that we looked at and other different ideas, but once

1475
01:04:24,823 --> 01:04:27,406
we committed to that hub design, there was sort of no going back.

1476
01:04:27,886 --> 01:04:28,647
We had to just...

1477
01:04:29,247 --> 01:04:33,630
Really nail it and all the way in the last six months of the project. It was nerve-wracking

1478
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:37,652
But as I mentioned Luis Sanchez John Palamarchuk and Florian Strauss

1479
01:04:37,893 --> 01:04:39,093
They really pulled through on it

1480
01:04:39,514 --> 01:04:43,196
And I really respect how much everyone just kind of stuck to their guns and kept going

1481
01:04:43,596 --> 01:04:46,278
Because it was very integral to the game by that point

1482
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:48,822
OK, last one.

1483
01:04:48,862 --> 01:04:49,022
Yeah.

1484
01:04:49,602 --> 01:04:49,982
Hi, Rob.

1485
01:04:50,462 --> 01:04:51,302
Thanks for the talk.

1486
01:04:52,563 --> 01:04:55,324
I was wondering if you have some guidelines in order

1487
01:04:55,404 --> 01:04:59,625
to design side missions or optional areas,

1488
01:05:00,805 --> 01:05:03,446
thinking about what you said, that at the end

1489
01:05:03,506 --> 01:05:07,747
of every critical pod level, you have to get a new ability.

1490
01:05:08,247 --> 01:05:11,148
So how you could design side missions,

1491
01:05:11,388 --> 01:05:15,309
making them interesting and satisfactory to the player

1492
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:15,890
at the end?

1493
01:05:16,827 --> 01:05:21,871
I'll speak on behalf of our exploration lead a little bit here, and I hope I express his

1494
01:05:21,911 --> 01:05:22,871
philosophies correctly.

1495
01:05:22,891 --> 01:05:29,035
He has often mentioned to me that he believes once there was a strong narrative thread through

1496
01:05:29,055 --> 01:05:33,838
the side missions that it really created a lot more drive for players because they actually

1497
01:05:33,898 --> 01:05:36,440
liked Kratos and Atreus as a partnership together.

1498
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,582
And when they lacked narrative, it was problematic.

1499
01:05:41,723 --> 01:05:45,125
the additional narrative through line of those side missions is critical.

1500
01:05:45,605 --> 01:05:47,546
And also the reward tuning on them.

1501
01:05:48,447 --> 01:05:50,448
If you have a bad reward at the end of those,

1502
01:05:51,408 --> 01:05:53,749
if players are giving you a one through five, if they don't like the reward,

1503
01:05:53,769 --> 01:05:54,510
it doesn't matter what happened.

1504
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:56,391
They'll just give you a one or something like that.

1505
01:05:56,431 --> 01:05:57,151
They didn't like the reward.

1506
01:05:57,391 --> 01:05:59,072
So you got to really get the rewards correct.

1507
01:05:59,112 --> 01:06:02,293
And you really have to have it can't just live on gameplay.

1508
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:05,115
There also has to be like a strong narrative through line as well.

1509
01:06:05,915 --> 01:06:07,096
Thank you. And happy GDC.
