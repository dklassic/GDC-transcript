1
00:00:02,408 --> 00:00:07,170
everybody. Welcome to the job simulator postmortem. We're

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,591
going to be talking about the design, tech and business

3
00:00:09,591 --> 00:00:13,473
lessons learned from job simulator. My name is Alex

4
00:00:13,473 --> 00:00:17,635
Schwartz, and I'm the CEO and janitor of Alchemy Labs. And I'm

5
00:00:17,635 --> 00:00:22,198
Devin Reimer, CTO, chief technical owl at Alchemy Labs.

6
00:00:22,198 --> 00:00:26,060
So first off, if anyone doesn't know what is job simulator,

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,521
we're going to show an abbreviated version of the

8
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:29,902
trailer for a couple seconds.

9
00:00:31,757 --> 00:00:32,317
Time to jump.

10
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:39,799
This looks like it'll taste interesting.

11
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:42,620
Pistons in the engine, don't eat those.

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,480
Delicious!

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,381
You've been doing a really good job lately.

14
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:52,743
I think it's about time you got a promotion.

15
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:54,043
Hooray! It's five o'clock!

16
00:00:54,043 --> 00:00:55,244
Woohoo! It's time to go home!

17
00:00:55,244 --> 00:01:00,005
Yeah, I'm gonna have to ask you to come home.

18
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:00,745
Saturday.

19
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,541
So shout out to Kurt Garner who did the trailer on this

20
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,002
that we cut apart for this part.

21
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,924
All right, so we're gonna talk about what went right,

22
00:01:11,924 --> 00:01:14,807
what went wrong, and the story of the conception

23
00:01:14,807 --> 00:01:16,588
of Job Simulator and what we learned throughout.

24
00:01:16,588 --> 00:01:19,070
So who has 14 hours to sit in this room

25
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,412
and go through the whole story?

26
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:23,713
No, we're gonna share some of the most relevant things

27
00:01:23,713 --> 00:01:25,595
that we learned and hopefully leave time for questions

28
00:01:25,595 --> 00:01:29,638
because this is such a expansive world of VR

29
00:01:29,638 --> 00:01:30,578
from all different topics,

30
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:32,100
so we'd love to get some questions at the end.

31
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:37,495
So let's roll back in time to a time before VR,

32
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:40,477
where we smacked rocks together, apparently.

33
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:44,459
So we at Alchemy Labs, we started the company back in

34
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:48,180
2010, and we've been working on PC and desktop games for

35
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:48,740
quite a while.

36
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,722
We shipped Jack Lumber and Ah and Snuggle Truck and Discourse

37
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:56,164
with a small four-person team before the days of VR.

38
00:01:57,738 --> 00:01:59,658
And then the Oculus Rift Kickstarter happened.

39
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:02,559
When we received the DK1, we realized that VR was going to

40
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:03,839
be a thing this time.

41
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:07,720
So we dropped what we were doing, which at the time

42
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,181
wasn't a thing that we just did, drop stuff.

43
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:11,741
But we realized this was so important.

44
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:15,382
So we started work on a port of Ahh to bring it to the

45
00:02:15,382 --> 00:02:18,403
Oculus, and we called it Ahhculus.

46
00:02:18,403 --> 00:02:21,703
And it ended up being the first VR game on Steam that

47
00:02:21,703 --> 00:02:22,683
wasn't made by Valve.

48
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,255
What ended up happening was we ended up doing this port and started thinking about what was next.

49
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:37,041
We wanted to make some more VR content, but we ended up running this problem as every one of our game ideas had this like,

50
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:41,866
seemed like it needed to be compromised to fit into the form factor of VR.

51
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:46,931
Nothing ended up feeling right, and we knew that we didn't want to make a game with motion sickness at all.

52
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:49,313
We wanted to make sure that VR was a thing for everyone.

53
00:02:51,845 --> 00:02:55,748
So that's the moment that we got invited to do Valve's room demo

54
00:02:55,748 --> 00:02:57,129
at Steam Dev Days 2014.

55
00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:02,393
And it was like a religious epiphany going into that room

56
00:03:02,393 --> 00:03:04,554
and putting on that headset and realizing

57
00:03:04,554 --> 00:03:05,615
what it felt like to have.

58
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:09,558
sub millimeter tracking that you can move about a room. It

59
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:13,342
really changed everything for us. And that was kind of the

60
00:03:13,342 --> 00:03:17,065
start where we said 100% of our efforts moving forward are to

61
00:03:17,065 --> 00:03:19,948
try to realize this vision in some kind of consumer product

62
00:03:19,948 --> 00:03:22,530
and build games for it. But at this time you've got stickers

63
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,293
all over a wall. No one would ever do this. And kind of walked

64
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:28,175
out of that room feeling disappointed because how would

65
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:31,158
this ever happen in someone's living room? It seems so far

66
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:31,919
away and academic.

67
00:03:33,082 --> 00:03:38,205
and that's when we got invited to a meeting and Valve and HTC

68
00:03:38,205 --> 00:03:41,447
told us they would be actually productizing a thing called the

69
00:03:41,447 --> 00:03:44,289
Vive and said, would you like to drop everything you're doing

70
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:47,591
and try to build some kind of show piece for GDC? By the way,

71
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:51,773
we can't get you this hardware until a couple weeks before GDC

72
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:55,115
so would you want to try to do something completely insane and

73
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:59,118
build something for it? And we said, of course. And since we

74
00:03:59,118 --> 00:04:01,219
were all remote as a small company, we

75
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,121
We decided to go up to Winnipeg for a couple reasons to Devin's house.

76
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:12,583
One was that Devin's wife was eight and a half months pregnant with twins.

77
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:17,344
And that, I don't know if anyone knows, if you fly at that level of pregnancy,

78
00:04:17,344 --> 00:04:20,185
it's like, you can't go anywhere, you're grounded, you're stuck.

79
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:25,967
So we all went up to Winnipeg in the middle of the winter, which was a fantastic move.

80
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,767
Yeah.

81
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:28,928
No, don't clap for that.

82
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:35,597
And so we went and we got this shipment of this early Vive dev

83
00:04:35,597 --> 00:04:38,979
kit, and we had one week together to try to build

84
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,739
something for GDC.

85
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,180
So let's talk about how that went.

86
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,721
So when we said that we were going to go do this, we started

87
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:49,442
thinking about what would be interesting in VR when you had

88
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:51,343
hands and you could move around.

89
00:04:51,343 --> 00:04:54,524
And the early idea was a WarioWare-like game, where it's

90
00:04:54,524 --> 00:04:56,024
like a whole bunch of different mini-games.

91
00:04:56,024 --> 00:04:58,465
That means we could explore a lot of different spaces.

92
00:05:00,649 --> 00:05:05,412
The first thing that we ended up doing, because when we got the hardware there was literally nothing for it, right?

93
00:05:05,412 --> 00:05:09,835
So we just got this thing and we had to start building what we wanted to actually see.

94
00:05:09,835 --> 00:05:14,418
And the earliest example we ended up doing was we ended up building three cubes and we put them on a table

95
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:17,480
and we added physics to them so you could pick them up and throw them.

96
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,562
And instantly it was just this thing, it was like, whoa, this is super cool.

97
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:27,945
And we ended up feeling that kind of like, I am a small child and I'm manipulating objects for the first time

98
00:05:27,945 --> 00:05:31,907
and I'm stacking them and I'm doing lots of interesting things with them.

99
00:05:31,907 --> 00:05:37,209
Like literally that's how it felt because that's what I was doing sitting on the floor here with some cubes.

100
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:38,130
So we realized that hands were the key.

101
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:46,913
They were the simplest input and when you added physics, things got incredibly interesting.

102
00:05:48,686 --> 00:05:52,387
So once we kind of got past the point of, OK, we're going to be

103
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:55,188
using our hands to do some kind of mini games, we continued

104
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,489
forward with our thoughts that we should build a couple weird

105
00:05:58,489 --> 00:05:59,169
little mini games.

106
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,670
And so the first thing that we had a dock, and we were just

107
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,911
listing bad ideas.

108
00:06:03,911 --> 00:06:05,591
And so we thought, OK, a circus performer.

109
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:07,672
And so we started to build something where you could

110
00:06:07,672 --> 00:06:12,274
balance some kind of pole on your hand and throw a ball.

111
00:06:12,274 --> 00:06:13,754
So we prototyped that.

112
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:16,736
We also prototyped a really quick version of a,

113
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:20,839
you're a window washer on the 52nd floor of a skyscraper,

114
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,460
and we thought we were super geniuses

115
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,482
because we put two little levers

116
00:06:25,482 --> 00:06:27,763
which would move you left and right on the building

117
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:31,505
and up and down, and then you'd pick up a little squeegee

118
00:06:31,505 --> 00:06:32,426
and you'd wash windows.

119
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:35,508
By the way, that was terrifying.

120
00:06:35,508 --> 00:06:38,050
So we had some people buckle and just lay on the floor

121
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,050
and start crying, can't do it.

122
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,813
And then we thought, okay, maybe you could be a chef.

123
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:47,317
and so we started prototyping a quick area of kind of like

124
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:50,740
where a line chef would be doing their work.

125
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:54,123
We also modeled out and started prototyping

126
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:57,906
a bartender simulation, and we thought,

127
00:06:57,906 --> 00:06:59,808
okay, it would be really cool if we have

128
00:06:59,808 --> 00:07:02,950
kind of slippery physics and we could end up pouring

129
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,755
and then throwing these kind of glasses down the table,

130
00:07:07,755 --> 00:07:08,635
root beer tapper type of thing.

131
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:13,820
And so we started to see what some of the commonality was,

132
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,543
is that near field manipulation, where you can physically

133
00:07:16,543 --> 00:07:18,365
walk over to something and pick it up and use your hands

134
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:20,907
and grab within the range of where you can be,

135
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,929
was extremely awesome.

136
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:24,230
And so we needed to build stuff

137
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,112
where things are all around you.

138
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,514
And then we kind of realized everything that we were doing

139
00:07:29,055 --> 00:07:30,816
you are kind of doing a job.

140
00:07:30,816 --> 00:07:32,918
You're assuming the role of a profession,

141
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:34,779
so these are all kind of jobs.

142
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:36,400
And so I opened a Google Doc

143
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,523
and I titled it Job Simulator as a temp joke name,

144
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:42,865
and then we went forward with our bad ideas from there.

145
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:46,668
And the kitchen seemed to have the most promise

146
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:48,690
as a current prototype, so we thought,

147
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,472
let's just kind of not work on everything else

148
00:07:51,472 --> 00:07:53,934
and push forward on making some kind of VR kitchen

149
00:07:53,934 --> 00:07:54,935
and see where it goes.

150
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:59,305
And yeah, now we just have to kind of build a GDC demo now

151
00:07:59,305 --> 00:08:00,450
with what, four days left.

152
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:05,516
So what we ended up discovering very early on is that

153
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:07,097
expectations can kill you.

154
00:08:07,097 --> 00:08:09,679
We had a huge problem with the kitchen.

155
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:12,621
Everyone had preconceived notions of how a kitchen would

156
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:14,323
work, how you made food.

157
00:08:14,323 --> 00:08:16,644
And now we need to realize this in VR.

158
00:08:16,644 --> 00:08:19,787
We realized that we needed to satisfy all these expectations

159
00:08:19,787 --> 00:08:23,029
some way or another, and realized that if you can't

160
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:25,351
deliver on something, you either need to come up with

161
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:27,853
something really creative, or you just need to cut it.

162
00:08:27,853 --> 00:08:30,435
So two examples are the rolling pin and the knife we

163
00:08:30,435 --> 00:08:31,095
want to talk about.

164
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:33,223
So first, the rolling pin.

165
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:35,524
So this was an obvious thing to model, a rolling pin in a

166
00:08:35,524 --> 00:08:36,464
kitchen makes a lot of sense.

167
00:08:36,464 --> 00:08:37,424
You can pick up an object.

168
00:08:37,424 --> 00:08:39,404
You can interact with it.

169
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:40,865
But it had affordances.

170
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:43,065
And one of the affordances is that it could flatten things.

171
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:45,166
And so people would try to grab this thing with two hands

172
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,706
and try to flatten objects.

173
00:08:46,706 --> 00:08:48,186
And this was a physics nightmare.

174
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:51,707
So we ended up realizing that the rolling pin just couldn't

175
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:54,828
exist, and we realized that every single

176
00:08:54,828 --> 00:08:55,788
object needs a purpose.

177
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:57,828
It's not just enough that it's pick-up-able.

178
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,809
Every single object in Job Simulator has some underlying

179
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:01,229
purpose.

180
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:05,252
So the knife was an interesting one,

181
00:09:05,252 --> 00:09:07,213
and let's go into this.

182
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,834
So basically, everyone thinks there should be a knife

183
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:11,594
in a kitchen, and so we put the knife in,

184
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:13,335
and then everyone wants to cut something,

185
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:15,216
so we said, okay, we need to add a cutting system.

186
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:17,936
So we wrote our own dynamic cutting system

187
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:20,577
that would ray cast through cuttable objects,

188
00:09:20,577 --> 00:09:22,678
build the interior meshes on the thing that got split,

189
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:25,639
create rigid bodies for all the pieces that got created,

190
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,580
and here's the first thing that everyone did.

191
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,282
is they grab the knives and then they chop chop chop chop chop chop chop chop

192
00:09:31,282 --> 00:09:36,746
and so anyone who's done any work in like video game physics would start

193
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:41,230
tearing up at the fact that that you've now got like 30 interpenetrating rigid

194
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,712
bodies that are falling and shaking through the table

195
00:09:43,712 --> 00:09:46,394
and now your frame rate's starting to dip because you took a piece of celery

196
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:50,917
and made it into 40 celeries and so it's this rigid body nightmare so

197
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:51,678
we thought

198
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,740
We are gonna joke our way out of this one.

199
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,265
We're gonna make awesome knives that when you cut,

200
00:09:57,265 --> 00:09:58,667
they shatter into pieces.

201
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,568
So, haha, we got you.

202
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,489
Turns out that's extremely disappointing.

203
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:09,671
And so, we ended up littering the whole area

204
00:10:09,671 --> 00:10:12,452
with lots of knives, because that was a good idea.

205
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:15,273
The goal is to have people cut less things,

206
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:17,654
and people are like, can we just have more knives?

207
00:10:17,654 --> 00:10:19,875
And it was like, oh, it's kind of defeating the purpose here.

208
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,775
It was just glass knives breaking everywhere.

209
00:10:21,775 --> 00:10:22,956
It doesn't work.

210
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,497
And so then we thought, later on, hey,

211
00:10:25,497 --> 00:10:28,438
let's task one of our engineers with the concept of.

212
00:10:28,798 --> 00:10:34,400
cartoonish rubber knives that bend away from items so they can't cut things. That was one of

213
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:45,044
our worst ideas ever. And so this was during development. This is some problems. Yeah. And

214
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:53,967
then this was the extremely creepy end result. It's like a rubber scythe.

215
00:10:55,733 --> 00:11:00,138
Um, it was, it kind of like made you feel sick to look at it.

216
00:11:00,138 --> 00:11:01,580
It was really weird in VR.

217
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,463
Everything feels different and it's just unacceptable.

218
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:09,889
So, uh, we ended up cutting the knife post GDC build, but that's kind of the story

219
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:13,493
of how one item that you think should be in a kitchen can have all of these

220
00:11:13,493 --> 00:11:15,155
different affordances that we can't deliver on.

221
00:11:16,587 --> 00:11:19,829
So we knew that we needed a character, someone that you

222
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:21,010
could interact with.

223
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,331
So early on, we realized that with the amount of scope and

224
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:25,552
time that we had, that we needed to simplify things.

225
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:28,034
So the idea of floating robots came up because that was

226
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:30,495
something that we could easily move around an environment and

227
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:31,956
have you communicate with.

228
00:11:31,956 --> 00:11:34,197
This allowed us to not have to rig and

229
00:11:34,197 --> 00:11:35,298
skin complex characters.

230
00:11:35,298 --> 00:11:38,099
It was very performance friendly because VR is very,

231
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:39,640
very performance intensive.

232
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,622
and we realized we could actually yield some empathy

233
00:11:43,622 --> 00:11:46,884
through the basic facial structure of a robot. So we

234
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:51,246
were in this process of developing this GDC build and we

235
00:11:51,246 --> 00:11:56,329
were a few days in and we realized that maybe we needed an

236
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,150
intro. Maybe we needed to figure out where the person was

237
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,172
standing, give them some stories so that when they ended up going

238
00:12:02,172 --> 00:12:05,533
to the kitchen they started to understand what this game was.

239
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:11,736
This is Jobbot's office in this early build.

240
00:12:11,736 --> 00:12:13,417
And you see there's this pedestal in the

241
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:14,297
middle with a bell.

242
00:12:14,297 --> 00:12:16,678
The thought was this pedestal would come out of the floor

243
00:12:16,678 --> 00:12:17,959
when you were standing out of the way.

244
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:19,940
And then when you rang the bell, you'd be positioned in

245
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,261
the exact right location for the game.

246
00:12:22,261 --> 00:12:25,883
And then super early Jobbot here would come and tell you

247
00:12:25,883 --> 00:12:28,604
some stories about what this game was actually like.

248
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:30,981
And this also acted like a hub world.

249
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:32,782
We had VHS tapes on this table.

250
00:12:32,782 --> 00:12:34,802
And you could go over and grab the Gourmet Chef one.

251
00:12:34,802 --> 00:12:36,122
And then you could plug it directly

252
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,503
into the face of JobBot.

253
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,883
JobBot had this VHS hole at one point.

254
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:44,204
So we ended up having that in an early build that we sent

255
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:44,864
over to Valve.

256
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:48,045
And Valve was like, you do realize you have three minutes

257
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:49,285
to demo this game, right?

258
00:12:49,285 --> 00:12:52,006
And your intro is like two.

259
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:54,006
So we realized, oh, we need to cut this.

260
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:57,485
It should have been an expectation and realization

261
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,026
that we needed to shorten all the game play and get rid of

262
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:02,687
the intro and not build it to begin with, but it ended up

263
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:06,109
being an incredibly valuable, one of the most valuable things

264
00:13:06,109 --> 00:13:08,670
that we ended up doing because it ended up leading us to the

265
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,691
premise of the game. So a game about jobs, the original

266
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:15,273
premise was that it was a training simulator for people to

267
00:13:15,273 --> 00:13:18,794
learn how to job, but why was that a thing that existed?

268
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:23,028
It ended up through that jobbot's office.

269
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:25,330
At the time, we were doing a lot of thinking about what the

270
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,752
future of jobs looked like.

271
00:13:26,752 --> 00:13:28,193
And we were talking about the singularity.

272
00:13:28,193 --> 00:13:29,835
And it was a lot of things we were talking about, like, hey,

273
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:30,495
what if jobs went away?

274
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,377
What would the world look like?

275
00:13:32,377 --> 00:13:34,459
And then we started rolling that into the actual game.

276
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:37,062
And the premise is that it's the year 2050 and robots have

277
00:13:37,062 --> 00:13:38,523
taken all human jobs.

278
00:13:38,523 --> 00:13:39,764
And that the job simulator is actually a

279
00:13:40,045 --> 00:13:44,627
historical recreation of what it was like to job. It was no longer the simulator trying to teach

280
00:13:44,627 --> 00:13:48,849
you how to job correctly. It was the robots trying to figure out what it was like to job so

281
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:54,232
that future humans could experience the same thing. But with poor Wikipedia skills that they

282
00:13:54,232 --> 00:13:56,393
kind of skimmed and said, I guess that's how it worked.

283
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:03,348
And so having that strong premise meant that we could have a better process.

284
00:14:03,348 --> 00:14:06,910
Well, we had a better design process throughout and writing process throughout.

285
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:11,232
So, for example, one of our first tasks in the kitchen was you have to make soup.

286
00:14:11,232 --> 00:14:16,235
And so with the simplicity of what we were trying to do with picking up objects and throwing them,

287
00:14:16,235 --> 00:14:20,257
we thought, okay, why don't we just make it so that you toss a bunch of items into a pot arbitrarily?

288
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,968
and out comes a fully formed can of soup.

289
00:14:23,968 --> 00:14:25,850
Because I guess the robots didn't know

290
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,911
how a real soup making process worked

291
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:29,052
and they saw the two pieces

292
00:14:29,052 --> 00:14:30,893
and put it together in their head.

293
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:33,896
And so that allowed us to be really creative

294
00:14:33,896 --> 00:14:36,458
in how we were able to tackle design questions.

295
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,739
Like we were able to use a microwave

296
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:41,862
and kind of like label it as this elite cooking device

297
00:14:41,862 --> 00:14:42,782
that the top chefs would use.

298
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,824
And so you could make a fully formed cake.

299
00:14:45,124 --> 00:14:49,071
by putting flour, bread, and something into,

300
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:50,553
was it flour and?

301
00:14:50,553 --> 00:14:50,894
Eggs.

302
00:14:50,894 --> 00:14:51,154
Eggs.

303
00:14:51,154 --> 00:14:55,341
But it wasn't really flour, it was like a flour,

304
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:55,742
with petals.

305
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:59,488
So yeah, it's bad puns and combinations led to this.

306
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:02,867
So we got to the point where we're starting to think,

307
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:04,227
okay, we have something that's fun,

308
00:15:04,227 --> 00:15:06,648
now how do we do this, how do we do this?

309
00:15:06,648 --> 00:15:10,169
And it turned out, even the most simple things

310
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:12,009
were extremely challenging in the early days.

311
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:14,469
So the concept of how picking up items

312
00:15:14,469 --> 00:15:16,270
and the affordances should work visually,

313
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,090
what does the hand show when you pick something up?

314
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,251
What are the rules of all the physics interactions

315
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:21,291
inside of VR?

316
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,791
And so in these days, people were mostly

317
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,272
just showing the controller visuals.

318
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:28,693
and not many people had shown hand visuals.

319
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:31,975
And the thing is, like grabbing inside of an item

320
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:33,796
and it interpenetrates and showing your hand

321
00:15:33,796 --> 00:15:36,997
going through something, it just didn't feel great.

322
00:15:36,997 --> 00:15:40,839
And a lot of people were also building full arm IK

323
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:43,320
on your first person view, so you'd look down

324
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,662
and you'd see your elbow in a completely wrong spot

325
00:15:45,662 --> 00:15:47,723
because there's no way to really predict that data.

326
00:15:47,723 --> 00:15:49,564
So it was kind of a mess.

327
00:15:51,725 --> 00:15:54,226
thought that maybe we could just do a quick hack

328
00:15:54,226 --> 00:15:56,967
and try something where when you pick up an item,

329
00:15:56,967 --> 00:16:01,330
your hand just goes away to lessen the overlap effect.

330
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,030
And it turned out, we had no idea,

331
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,132
it turned out it was an extremely effective way

332
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:08,253
and it had this kind of mental process

333
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:11,235
that we dubbed tomato presence kind of as a joke,

334
00:16:11,235 --> 00:16:13,596
where you have hand presence with your hand.

335
00:16:14,036 --> 00:16:15,117
and then when you pick up an item

336
00:16:15,117 --> 00:16:16,997
and you remove the hand visual,

337
00:16:16,997 --> 00:16:19,258
the tomato acts as like a visual stand-in

338
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:20,219
for where your hand is,

339
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:21,759
and it's perfect rotation and perfect position,

340
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,060
so you still have presence,

341
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,781
it's just your hand presence turns into tomato presence.

342
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:27,382
And so since the tomato was the first thing

343
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:28,662
you encounter in the job,

344
00:16:28,662 --> 00:16:29,883
that's why we named it that,

345
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:32,784
and now we've seen a multitude of GDC talks

346
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,405
over the past couple years that refer to

347
00:16:34,405 --> 00:16:37,406
the official hiding hand technique as tomato presence.

348
00:16:37,406 --> 00:16:38,707
So write it down everyone,

349
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:40,288
it's going in the textbooks, tomato presence.

350
00:16:42,154 --> 00:16:47,441
And so room scale was kind of this big thing. So fun fact,

351
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:50,465
when we got the first headset, there was no chaperone. No

352
00:16:50,465 --> 00:16:51,266
chaperone. So

353
00:16:51,933 --> 00:16:54,454
we were walking into things and we had no ability

354
00:16:54,454 --> 00:16:55,555
to tell where the walls were.

355
00:16:55,555 --> 00:16:58,696
And so we thought, well, how do we make an environment

356
00:16:58,696 --> 00:17:02,657
that doesn't, that makes it so that people feel like

357
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:05,198
they are in a space where they can access everything

358
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:08,659
and that the room, you know, you could stay in a safe area

359
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:11,400
but build something that affords the space that you have.

360
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,620
And you don't want Chaperone to be the thing that stops you.

361
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,221
You want the world to kind of exist in a way

362
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:17,182
that I don't want to go forward

363
00:17:17,182 --> 00:17:18,822
because there's a table here or something like that.

364
00:17:19,222 --> 00:17:22,645
So a lot of thinking about that was happening right now.

365
00:17:22,645 --> 00:17:27,229
So as I mentioned, physics was a super, super important thing.

366
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:29,811
And we realized that once you end up having some objects

367
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:32,473
that you can pick up, you want to pick up everything.

368
00:17:32,473 --> 00:17:34,575
So there's no hiding that fact anymore.

369
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:36,536
If that thing looks like something that you can pick up,

370
00:17:36,536 --> 00:17:38,778
you need to be able to pick it up, which ended up

371
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:40,739
taking a ton of time in Job Simulator,

372
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:42,581
but it is now just the way that we operate.

373
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:49,246
So this is getting closer to the end of our week period.

374
00:17:49,246 --> 00:17:50,827
And then we had our lighthouse fail.

375
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:53,228
And we only had one lighthouse.

376
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:55,710
So we talked to Valve, and we're like, we need another

377
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,370
one ASAP.

378
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,331
And they weren't sure they could ship it through customs

379
00:17:58,331 --> 00:17:59,672
to Canada fast enough.

380
00:17:59,672 --> 00:18:02,774
So we decided to fall back to a Razor Hydra.

381
00:18:02,774 --> 00:18:03,935
So we ended up building this setup.

382
00:18:03,935 --> 00:18:08,198
And long story short, it is not even remotely comparable.

383
00:18:08,198 --> 00:18:10,179
So that ended up being a waste of time.

384
00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:15,077
But luckily, we ended up getting a shipment of another

385
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:18,218
lighthouse just in time for us to finish up the GDC build.

386
00:18:18,218 --> 00:18:18,978
Thanks, Chet.

387
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:26,261
So this is the final result of the kitchen that we ended up

388
00:18:26,261 --> 00:18:26,941
shipping for GDC.

389
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:30,243
If you've played the actual kitchen, you see some of it's

390
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,984
the same, some of it is radically different.

391
00:18:32,984 --> 00:18:36,145
But this is everything that's basically interactable.

392
00:18:36,145 --> 00:18:38,246
Some of our old sandwich making system.

393
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:42,082
That one definitely stuck around.

394
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:46,345
And so the same thing of like serving things on a plate.

395
00:18:46,345 --> 00:18:49,207
So we ended up having that basic functionality of the kitchen

396
00:18:49,207 --> 00:18:51,849
that carried all the way through to ship of the game.

397
00:18:54,108 --> 00:18:56,629
So, I mean, it looked very primitive.

398
00:18:56,629 --> 00:18:58,350
And Job Simulator in the early days

399
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,730
didn't show well at all in video form.

400
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:03,251
But people went into this first experience,

401
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:04,871
and again, this was the first time that

402
00:19:04,871 --> 00:19:07,512
really anyone had had true hand presence in VR

403
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:11,853
and was able to move around with real accuracy.

404
00:19:11,853 --> 00:19:14,714
And so press came out of these GDC 2015 demos.

405
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,735
with their mind completely blown.

406
00:19:17,735 --> 00:19:20,175
And a lot of people called out Job Simulator

407
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:23,476
as this unexpected, the kitchen thing that I played,

408
00:19:23,476 --> 00:19:26,557
that I just stood there and I think it was Time

409
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:30,918
that said, I never knew that the most compelling experience

410
00:19:30,918 --> 00:19:32,118
I could ever have in a virtual world

411
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:33,679
was throwing a tomato at a robot.

412
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,679
And so it was blowing everyone's minds

413
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:39,340
and it was an incredible experience to kind of be there

414
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,421
at the genesis of this new hardware.

415
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:47,484
It was it was amazing and now it was time to just got to build the full game

416
00:19:47,484 --> 00:19:51,967
right. So at that time we had no idea

417
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:55,509
whether this hardware would really ship what the price would be whether this

418
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:59,851
market would be a thing and so it was one of the riskiest decisions we ever made

419
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:03,734
was to just push forward with this high end VR game design

420
00:20:03,734 --> 00:20:07,476
for platforms we didn't even know would exist or not and just said that's

421
00:20:07,476 --> 00:20:11,518
what we're going to do whether it works or we go out of business we're just going to push.

422
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:15,675
And that was when our colleagues, friends, family,

423
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:18,956
company advisors said, hey, we're not really sure

424
00:20:18,956 --> 00:20:19,876
about this whole VR thing.

425
00:20:19,876 --> 00:20:22,677
Maybe you should mitigate some risk

426
00:20:22,677 --> 00:20:24,658
and build a mobile game.

427
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:26,579
You should build a mobile game.

428
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:27,939
That's probably a better idea.

429
00:20:27,939 --> 00:20:31,500
And then we said, no, we're gonna do VR

430
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,961
or we're gonna go out of business

431
00:20:32,961 --> 00:20:35,001
because we're that sold that this is the future.

432
00:20:36,337 --> 00:20:39,078
So in our early thought process,

433
00:20:39,078 --> 00:20:41,279
we thought we're gonna make 10 jobs

434
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,220
and we're gonna start prototyping them all simultaneously

435
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,640
and we're gonna just go nuts.

436
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,601
Well, not all of them,

437
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:48,681
but we're gonna go with three and push forward.

438
00:20:48,681 --> 00:20:51,442
And so we started on the prototypes of a chemistry lab

439
00:20:51,442 --> 00:20:55,123
and a magician where you're in a backyard

440
00:20:55,123 --> 00:20:58,384
doing magic tricks for a group of small robot children.

441
00:20:59,907 --> 00:21:05,098
and a space station repairman, repair person,

442
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,805
which that was just, hey, that sounds cool

443
00:21:07,805 --> 00:21:09,368
to have low gravity, let's try something there.

444
00:21:11,316 --> 00:21:13,418
So then we run into a problem.

445
00:21:13,418 --> 00:21:14,399
Something was wrong.

446
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,621
Everything that we ended up making

447
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:18,543
wasn't as good as the kitchen was.

448
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,445
Everyone loved the kitchen, but there was something

449
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,247
that was off with everything else we built.

450
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:24,028
It just wasn't nearly as fun.

451
00:21:24,028 --> 00:21:25,590
The humor wasn't coming through,

452
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,352
the gameplay wasn't quite coming through,

453
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,514
and we couldn't quite figure out why that was.

454
00:21:31,563 --> 00:21:35,428
So we started thinking, what makes a good job simulator job?

455
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:38,793
So we ended up getting some advice and figuring this out,

456
00:21:38,793 --> 00:21:42,678
that the reason was familiarity, that you take

457
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:45,622
your expectations of real life into these things.

458
00:21:45,622 --> 00:21:47,404
So if you had some understanding of how something

459
00:21:47,404 --> 00:21:48,345
was supposed to work.

460
00:21:48,846 --> 00:21:52,810
then we can play with that, then we can subvert that if we wanted or we can use that to our

461
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:57,194
advantage to allow you to play the game more easily. The further we got away from something

462
00:21:57,194 --> 00:22:02,058
that you understood, the more complicated and weird and less funny things got. So for

463
00:22:02,058 --> 00:22:05,541
example, let's say you're in the kitchen and you're making soup and putting ingredients

464
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:09,405
in and you get a can of soup. Everyone knows you're not supposed to get a can of soup and

465
00:22:09,405 --> 00:22:12,828
it's funny. But if you're in this chemistry lab and you're mixing chemicals together and

466
00:22:12,828 --> 00:22:15,590
then it creates a crazier chemical concoction.

467
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:19,034
Did you know what those ingredients were supposed to do in the first place?

468
00:22:19,034 --> 00:22:20,856
Not really, so we ended up losing that humor.

469
00:22:20,856 --> 00:22:24,601
So we realized that it was like that grounding, that familiarity that was the key.

470
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:26,763
Thanks to Patrick for that heads up there.

471
00:22:28,286 --> 00:22:29,927
So that brings us to The Office.

472
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:32,489
The Office is what we ended up showing so many demos of.

473
00:22:32,489 --> 00:22:35,212
It ended up being kind of the demo showpiece of the game.

474
00:22:35,212 --> 00:22:36,012
Most people don't know this.

475
00:22:36,012 --> 00:22:38,374
That was the eighth job we prototyped.

476
00:22:38,374 --> 00:22:42,057
It wasn't even on our original list when we ended up laying

477
00:22:42,057 --> 00:22:43,578
out those first 10 jobs.

478
00:22:43,578 --> 00:22:46,340
And right now, that seems completely obvious.

479
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,482
But at the time, it wasn't, because we were thinking about

480
00:22:48,482 --> 00:22:48,842
it wrong.

481
00:22:48,842 --> 00:22:51,625
We were thinking about what's the most exciting job that you

482
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:53,466
can do without thinking about what would

483
00:22:53,466 --> 00:22:54,607
actually be interesting.

484
00:22:56,194 --> 00:23:02,538
So this is a very early prototype of the office scene.

485
00:23:02,538 --> 00:23:07,781
So you can see that there's some elements here that definitely

486
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:12,484
carried over into the final version of the game.

487
00:23:12,484 --> 00:23:12,945
Staplers.

488
00:23:12,945 --> 00:23:13,505
Yeah.

489
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:20,808
So we thought, okay, let's, again,

490
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:23,430
let's move forward on this office.

491
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,572
So let's think of all the tropes we know

492
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:28,414
about every office thing, think about office space.

493
00:23:28,414 --> 00:23:31,136
We have to open with donuts and coffee.

494
00:23:31,136 --> 00:23:32,017
There's no other way.

495
00:23:32,017 --> 00:23:35,719
So we thought, well, I guess now we have to implement

496
00:23:35,719 --> 00:23:38,341
the entire stack of eating and drinking

497
00:23:38,341 --> 00:23:39,922
because we gotta make this,

498
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:42,064
we gotta sell the joke that's now needed.

499
00:23:42,064 --> 00:23:43,745
And we had avoided all edible.

500
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:48,509
tech in the kitchen because we're like, you're a chef, you

501
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:50,652
don't necessarily eat the food you're making, dot, dot, dot,

502
00:23:50,652 --> 00:23:53,537
we don't need it. But now we really need to deliver on coffee

503
00:23:53,537 --> 00:23:53,998
and donuts.

504
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:59,684
So it turns out eating in VR is more complicated

505
00:23:59,684 --> 00:24:03,386
because you put things near your face a lot

506
00:24:03,386 --> 00:24:06,088
and making a simple trigger that once you get close to it,

507
00:24:06,088 --> 00:24:10,111
you start eating, becomes unexpectedly,

508
00:24:10,111 --> 00:24:12,312
you unexpectedly eat things by accident.

509
00:24:12,312 --> 00:24:15,094
So we also needed to build multi-stage eating

510
00:24:15,094 --> 00:24:16,635
because you don't want to just completely.

511
00:24:16,935 --> 00:24:21,898
bite the whole thing and have it be gone, you want to get halfway into it. So that meant our artists had to build

512
00:24:21,898 --> 00:24:24,460
bite states of every single object that was edible,

513
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,540
including the sound effect of

514
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:32,284
juiciness of whether that item was this kind of thing and that or the color of the particle effect and all that. So, yes.

515
00:24:32,284 --> 00:24:36,787
It was very challenging. We ended up having one play tester early on that was taking things to the refrigerator

516
00:24:36,787 --> 00:24:41,810
and she was a bit shorter, so she was grabbing things. And every time she grabbed things out, she moved it near her face.

517
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,480
and she just was continuously eating everything she pulled out of the fridge

518
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,345
and couldn't figure out what was actually going on.

519
00:24:47,345 --> 00:24:50,353
So then we had to go through this whole process of building all these systems.

520
00:24:51,734 --> 00:24:56,698
So liquid in VR, this makes eating look like a cakewalk.

521
00:24:56,698 --> 00:25:00,521
So 3D fluid simulations are generally just not done in

522
00:25:00,521 --> 00:25:03,563
video games, let alone VR, where you have all these

523
00:25:03,563 --> 00:25:05,384
performance problems.

524
00:25:05,384 --> 00:25:07,025
And with direct input.

525
00:25:07,025 --> 00:25:09,427
I've seen some fluid simulations where I hit A, and

526
00:25:09,427 --> 00:25:12,249
they kind of pour something or do some sort of animation.

527
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:14,811
But you could directly impact the whole world in how the

528
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:16,593
fluid is actually being manipulated in VR.

529
00:25:17,657 --> 00:25:18,979
So this is an early tech.

530
00:25:18,979 --> 00:25:21,841
We had this mesh that we were modifying and

531
00:25:21,841 --> 00:25:23,183
trying to get to work.

532
00:25:23,183 --> 00:25:28,768
It looked interesting, and then just drastically broke

533
00:25:28,768 --> 00:25:30,730
down every time that you did anything even

534
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,791
remotely complicated.

535
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:33,353
I built this terrible tech.

536
00:25:33,353 --> 00:25:36,436
It was two bones rigged to a skin mesh, and it does not

537
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:38,178
work in most cases.

538
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,386
So once you end up building liquid, all of a sudden there's these affordances that roll out of this thing.

539
00:25:46,386 --> 00:25:52,513
You expect fluid to boil, you expect fluid to be conserved when you pour it from one vessel into another.

540
00:25:52,513 --> 00:25:56,757
You expect when you end up combining different fluids that the colors mix correctly,

541
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:59,981
that when you pour fluid into world elements, worlds interact correctly.

542
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:04,564
Then we had to realize, oh man, every milliliter needs to store things like its active temperature

543
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:08,567
because it poured something cold into something hot, what the colors were of that, what the

544
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,709
actual ingredients list of every milliliter of fluid.

545
00:26:11,709 --> 00:26:13,910
And now I want to pour them into other volumes.

546
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,872
And now I need to be able to actually have fluid momentum in that.

547
00:26:16,872 --> 00:26:20,935
And this was all to just show a cup of coffee.

548
00:26:20,935 --> 00:26:26,739
So this is the final result of the system here.

549
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:28,120
Someone making a cup of coffee.

550
00:26:31,317 --> 00:26:34,758
We actually had somebody remark that this part of Job

551
00:26:34,758 --> 00:26:36,979
Simulator made them really angry when they were demoing

552
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:39,861
to people, because they were like, people go and they just

553
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:42,122
make a cup of coffee, and they drink it, and it's cool.

554
00:26:42,122 --> 00:26:47,364
And they're like, you don't realize how complicated that

555
00:26:47,364 --> 00:26:47,964
would be to build.

556
00:26:47,964 --> 00:26:51,066
So if you're interested in more, there's an

557
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:53,607
entire talk to this.

558
00:26:53,607 --> 00:26:55,728
We ended up doing an Upload VR article on how 850 hours to

559
00:26:55,728 --> 00:26:57,269
make that cup of coffee.

560
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:58,910
So you can check that out.

561
00:27:00,584 --> 00:27:05,548
So it turned out every new system that we would add to Job Simulator as we got through

562
00:27:05,548 --> 00:27:10,011
building a job or a task that required some new system, it would have fundamental backwards

563
00:27:10,011 --> 00:27:12,093
facing changes on everything else we had ever built.

564
00:27:12,093 --> 00:27:15,435
So the implications on the game could be good or bad.

565
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:19,619
So now that eating and drinking was in, every food-like item in any job, especially the

566
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:23,121
kitchen which is filled with them, needs to now be edible, which means all the bite states

567
00:27:23,121 --> 00:27:24,042
and all the art and all that.

568
00:27:24,402 --> 00:27:31,090
Every liquid or liquid like or anything that produces liquid or you expect maybe liquid could come out of it through some means

569
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:35,215
That needs to be tracked and drinkable and in the system

570
00:27:35,215 --> 00:27:37,317
And so you can't set expectations incorrectly

571
00:27:37,317 --> 00:27:42,383
You can't have one job where you could drink something and then you go somewhere else and it's no longer the case

572
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:46,005
And so our process for finding those missing expectations,

573
00:27:46,005 --> 00:27:48,727
because we can't know exactly what every set

574
00:27:48,727 --> 00:27:51,548
of human beings in the world expects about the world,

575
00:27:51,548 --> 00:27:53,890
was play testing, play testing, play testing.

576
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:56,491
So, here's a first example.

577
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:59,873
We had a plant in the office, and once we added coffee,

578
00:27:59,873 --> 00:28:03,155
people wanted to water the plant with coffee.

579
00:28:03,155 --> 00:28:04,977
And so, people would hold it there,

580
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:07,318
and they'd hit the coffee, and then they'd wait,

581
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,059
and they'd look at it, and they're like, ugh.

582
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,079
And so now we have to add that, right?

583
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:14,520
We have to live up to everyone's expectations

584
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,981
no matter how absurd they are,

585
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:18,162
because that's the joy of this world.

586
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:21,323
The photocopier was a perfect example.

587
00:28:21,323 --> 00:28:24,445
Everyone would put something in a photocopier

588
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:27,066
and expect an item, and then they'd get the item

589
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:28,547
to come out, and then they'd put their hand in,

590
00:28:28,547 --> 00:28:29,668
and then they'd put their head in,

591
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:30,908
and they would get a brain,

592
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:33,930
and people would lose their minds.

593
00:28:34,627 --> 00:28:39,649
every single time this happened, it was like an eruption of

594
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:42,330
laughter. I remember the first time we were in our office and

595
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,811
there were eight people standing around and everyone hushed

596
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:47,152
because someone started to put their head in and everyone is

597
00:28:47,152 --> 00:28:48,993
like, it's not going to work. It's not going to work. And it

598
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:51,574
was just pure silence. And then everyone started screaming when

599
00:28:51,574 --> 00:28:55,036
a brain flew out. And we've seen that on the achievement hunter

600
00:28:55,036 --> 00:28:58,938
video series that they've done. Everyone freaks out because no

601
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:01,519
one thinks that the developer is going to be that insane to go

602
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:01,899
that far.

603
00:29:03,995 --> 00:29:08,520
Another good story was the earliest version of the kitchen.

604
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,823
We had those plates, and Beth was playing,

605
00:29:11,823 --> 00:29:14,465
and so she took a plate and she threw it on the floor

606
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:16,647
and it did nothing, and she goes, this game sucks.

607
00:29:16,647 --> 00:29:19,570
So it was, and it was like, okay,

608
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,232
plate breaking is now the top of the list.

609
00:29:21,232 --> 00:29:24,235
So it's just little things like that,

610
00:29:24,235 --> 00:29:27,738
is if your worldview is a mismatch between real life,

611
00:29:27,738 --> 00:29:29,380
that it just doesn't work for you.

612
00:29:32,318 --> 00:29:35,680
So every bot is like a generic thing.

613
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,101
We made this generic thing, and we started adding costumes to

614
00:29:38,101 --> 00:29:39,702
them to make them more interesting.

615
00:29:39,702 --> 00:29:42,123
And as soon as we did that, people were like, I need to be

616
00:29:42,123 --> 00:29:43,704
able to take the costumes off.

617
00:29:43,704 --> 00:29:46,325
And then they're like, now that I have a pair of glasses,

618
00:29:46,325 --> 00:29:48,806
I need to wear the glasses.

619
00:29:48,806 --> 00:29:51,708
So we actually had to go back through the entire game and

620
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:54,549
re-architect all the costumes and all the tech to make sure

621
00:29:54,549 --> 00:29:56,250
that, oh, that bot comes in with a hat.

622
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,231
I can take that bot's hat off, put it onto that bot, and then

623
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:00,192
put it onto myself.

624
00:30:00,892 --> 00:30:06,836
So it's one of those things that as soon as you allow people to interact with things, everything needs to be interactable.

625
00:30:06,836 --> 00:30:09,537
And people use that to tell stories, they're like, enjoy this cowboy hat, idiot.

626
00:30:09,537 --> 00:30:10,918
For no reason, it's just fun.

627
00:30:10,918 --> 00:30:17,582
So we knew in the convenience store that we wanted to have some sort of...

628
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:24,005
Today's not your lucky day, pal. Open that safe and give me all your cheddar.

629
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:27,948
We wanted some sort of robbery, but this is what everybody ended up doing.

630
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,872
There's plenty more where that came from, kid.

631
00:30:37,825 --> 00:30:42,267
So that was a really challenging scene to make because we knew that we wanted some sort of robbery

632
00:30:42,267 --> 00:30:47,811
because it's very like cliche in a convenience store, but it's VR is super, super emotionally intense

633
00:30:47,811 --> 00:30:50,973
and we didn't want anybody being freaked out so we ended up having to go through and we have this

634
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:57,957
you know, bandit bot that's kind of funny and he has this like gangster weird accent and he's using words that are just like not like

635
00:30:57,957 --> 00:31:03,860
very, very scary words and has a banana and then you can grab the banana and then keep doing that and he has so many

636
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,821
VO lines to just like keep that funny.

637
00:31:09,127 --> 00:31:16,818
Once you end up going through the process of making everything interactable, you realize that you now have to redesign the entire world.

638
00:31:16,818 --> 00:31:20,023
It's like the giant, the biggest industrial design task.

639
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:25,867
A blender in real life is actually a really complicated thing generally.

640
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:31,691
They have lots of buttons and small interfaces which don't really work that well in VR.

641
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:34,133
So we ended up having to try to figure out how to solve the blender.

642
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:37,976
The blender was actually incredibly challenging to build because we didn't want this additional

643
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:41,439
object that you had to snap into that with a lid that you then took off and then you

644
00:31:41,439 --> 00:31:41,819
poured.

645
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:44,342
And it needed to be pretty big to fit the objects,

646
00:31:44,342 --> 00:31:46,365
but it didn't have a knife to cut the objects up

647
00:31:46,365 --> 00:31:47,826
into smaller pieces.

648
00:31:47,826 --> 00:31:49,308
So we had this giant problem.

649
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:51,491
And so we ended up going through and looking at things.

650
00:31:51,491 --> 00:31:53,453
And you see there's like this spigot on the side

651
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,995
that then you could pour fluid out of it

652
00:31:54,995 --> 00:31:56,858
without having to pick the entire thing up.

653
00:31:56,858 --> 00:31:58,860
And then having like small buttons and small dials

654
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,983
didn't really lend itself very well.

655
00:32:01,243 --> 00:32:05,987
to VR. So we ended up adding this like slot machine arm onto the side of it and that ended

656
00:32:05,987 --> 00:32:09,790
up having some pretty great implications because as you pulled it it would go faster and faster

657
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:14,414
and we could actually haptic in your hand as you were pulling it. It felt like the thing was blending.

658
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:24,555
Early on when we were going through this process and realizing that we needed to redesign literally every appliance ever made,

659
00:32:24,555 --> 00:32:31,721
I ended up going to toy stores and going through because what I discovered was that in VR right now at least,

660
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:36,245
you're closer to the interaction level of a two year old or a three year old.

661
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,606
Just really basic interactions.

662
00:32:37,606 --> 00:32:44,131
And so I would walk down these aisles and see how some designers would design toys for children

663
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:46,973
because there's some things that definitely have some overlap here.

664
00:32:48,935 --> 00:32:53,556
So as far as like how we were building at this state,

665
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:56,917
being able to find our problems and,

666
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:59,177
well, come up with a question and say,

667
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:00,617
is it gonna work this way or this way?

668
00:33:00,617 --> 00:33:03,318
We need to be able to prototype as fast as humanly possible

669
00:33:03,318 --> 00:33:06,519
to find whether it should be style A or style B or style C.

670
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:09,580
That was the ninth Blender iteration.

671
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,020
And every time we had a new play tester,

672
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,420
we'd look at how they approached the Blender

673
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,321
and whether they would know what to do

674
00:33:14,321 --> 00:33:15,261
or pause for a couple seconds

675
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:16,641
and then we'd go back to the drawing board

676
00:33:16,641 --> 00:33:17,482
to try to make it better.

677
00:33:18,085 --> 00:33:22,090
And so that meant that everyone who was building the game had

678
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,391
to have a VR headset at their desk

679
00:33:23,391 --> 00:33:24,793
so that they could test in editor

680
00:33:24,793 --> 00:33:26,815
and iterate as fast as humanly possible.

681
00:33:26,815 --> 00:33:29,979
And that we have kind of built our company around the fact

682
00:33:29,979 --> 00:33:32,622
that almost everyone at the company wears a ton of hats.

683
00:33:32,622 --> 00:33:34,143
And so if you are.

684
00:33:34,964 --> 00:33:37,989
working on this blender, you need to be able to do some

685
00:33:37,989 --> 00:33:41,033
light 3D modeling and some design and some programming

686
00:33:41,033 --> 00:33:42,755
and then do some testing and gather some feedback

687
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:44,157
and then go back and iterate.

688
00:33:44,157 --> 00:33:46,800
And so if you don't have to pass it off between people,

689
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,564
then you can shorten that iteration time

690
00:33:49,564 --> 00:33:50,665
and kind of keep things rolling

691
00:33:50,665 --> 00:33:51,767
as fast as humanly possible.

692
00:33:52,554 --> 00:33:57,137
So also the humor as far as how we've been writing the game,

693
00:33:57,137 --> 00:34:00,319
everyone at the company becomes a writer.

694
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:01,500
And so people come up to us and they're like,

695
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,121
oh, who was the writer for Job Simulator?

696
00:34:03,121 --> 00:34:03,801
That was really funny.

697
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:05,402
And we're like, no, everyone contributed

698
00:34:05,402 --> 00:34:08,324
because every single thing that goes into the game,

699
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:10,286
every poster on the wall,

700
00:34:10,286 --> 00:34:12,767
every like the keyboard at the computer,

701
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:14,929
it's all in this world of like,

702
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,210
what would robots think?

703
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:20,834
How did the world work through the lens of their

704
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:22,276
poorly done research?

705
00:34:22,276 --> 00:34:24,578
And so everyone needs to be bought in on that premise

706
00:34:24,578 --> 00:34:26,620
and everyone kind of needs to be a writer in that sense.

707
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,652
When we ended up setting out and starting work on this, we

708
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:35,273
ended up building for what ended up being like a 15-ish

709
00:34:35,273 --> 00:34:37,995
foot across size for GDC, because that was what we knew

710
00:34:37,995 --> 00:34:39,296
the booth size was.

711
00:34:39,296 --> 00:34:40,936
But we realized that that was not going to

712
00:34:40,936 --> 00:34:42,957
work in the real world.

713
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:44,638
Not everyone has a huge space.

714
00:34:44,638 --> 00:34:46,559
And how are we going to end up handling it?

715
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:49,941
So this is the final version of the convenience store in

716
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:51,402
the what we call three meter size.

717
00:34:51,402 --> 00:34:53,063
So it's three meters across.

718
00:34:53,543 --> 00:34:56,585
So what we ended up doing was ended up redesigning each one

719
00:34:56,585 --> 00:34:59,566
of the spaces for everyone's different play space size.

720
00:34:59,566 --> 00:35:03,488
So if we go to the next one, if you have a size that is 2 and

721
00:35:03,488 --> 00:35:06,150
1 1⁄2 meters or less, you end up switching into this size.

722
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,451
This is all transparent to the end user.

723
00:35:08,451 --> 00:35:10,852
We take a look at what the actual volume bounds that they

724
00:35:10,852 --> 00:35:13,254
have available, and we automatically do this so that

725
00:35:13,254 --> 00:35:14,834
the user doesn't have to select any settings.

726
00:35:14,834 --> 00:35:16,155
It just automatically happens.

727
00:35:16,695 --> 00:35:19,859
And this is not something that can be procedurally done.

728
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:22,241
You can't just scale the world up and down and be close

729
00:35:22,241 --> 00:35:24,884
enough, because everyone understands what the size of

730
00:35:24,884 --> 00:35:26,726
an object actually is in real life.

731
00:35:26,726 --> 00:35:28,788
So as soon as you scale it, it'll look off.

732
00:35:28,788 --> 00:35:32,312
So we actually lay out things differently based on the

733
00:35:32,312 --> 00:35:35,135
available space and change the way that things work.

734
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:35,775
So if you go to the.

735
00:35:36,436 --> 00:35:40,879
And so this is, if you end up having just that bare minimum size of 2 meters,

736
00:35:40,879 --> 00:35:42,401
this is what you'll end up getting.

737
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:46,424
And you'll notice that there's some things missing, like if you go back here, there's a freezer in the front,

738
00:35:46,424 --> 00:35:51,928
that ends up going under the counters and we end up moving objects or systems around

739
00:35:51,928 --> 00:35:54,010
and putting them in tool choosers and things like that.

740
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,411
But from an end user standpoint, they don't even

741
00:35:56,411 --> 00:35:58,152
know and need to know what's going on.

742
00:35:58,152 --> 00:35:59,412
And we've had people comment.

743
00:35:59,412 --> 00:36:02,374
They're like, I watched a streamer play the convenience

744
00:36:02,374 --> 00:36:05,155
store, and it looked different than my convenience store.

745
00:36:05,155 --> 00:36:06,496
Did I have a different version of the game?

746
00:36:06,496 --> 00:36:08,297
And it's like, no, that was the available space that you

747
00:36:08,297 --> 00:36:09,237
had versus the streamer.

748
00:36:10,939 --> 00:36:14,763
So menus were another thing that we had no concept of how

749
00:36:14,763 --> 00:36:15,924
we should approach.

750
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,786
And we had nothing we could really draw from.

751
00:36:17,786 --> 00:36:20,148
And we really felt like it would be a cop out to just

752
00:36:20,148 --> 00:36:22,450
make a 2D plane where you would interact with everything

753
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,693
in the method that we've been using for the past 30 years in

754
00:36:25,693 --> 00:36:26,854
games and interaction.

755
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:28,756
So we thought, OK, how are we going to use in-world

756
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:31,058
interactions, something that we already do as a verb in

757
00:36:31,058 --> 00:36:31,438
the game?

758
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,741
to do our menus.

759
00:36:34,741 --> 00:36:37,883
And so we're thinking, okay, we hit a bell in the kitchen,

760
00:36:37,883 --> 00:36:39,403
maybe we could do something where you hit a bell

761
00:36:39,403 --> 00:36:42,625
and then you get the menu somehow,

762
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:44,385
or you throw a mug at something,

763
00:36:44,385 --> 00:36:46,326
or maybe you smack some 3D button.

764
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:51,528
And so our first design was, let's hit a button on the

765
00:36:51,528 --> 00:36:53,869
controller, which there was a designated menu button.

766
00:36:53,869 --> 00:36:54,910
We needed one additional button.

767
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,590
By the way, there's one button in the game.

768
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,290
You just pick things up.

769
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:57,691
That's it.

770
00:36:57,691 --> 00:36:59,932
And so we had to have one more thing so that you could kind

771
00:36:59,932 --> 00:37:01,052
of pull up a menu.

772
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,653
And we thought, let's spawn this.

773
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:07,464
this thing and it would have buttons on it in all directions

774
00:37:07,464 --> 00:37:10,566
and you could hold it like a big Thor's hammer and you would

775
00:37:10,566 --> 00:37:16,491
poke it and something. It was terrible. And then finally the

776
00:37:16,491 --> 00:37:20,675
joke of what about a menu that's like a platter and then you eat

777
00:37:20,675 --> 00:37:21,015
the item.

778
00:37:21,716 --> 00:37:26,338
in the menu and that's where the exit burrito was invented.

779
00:37:26,338 --> 00:37:30,179
And so it was this perfect 3D representation

780
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:36,702
of how do you solve for menus that don't exist in 2D.

781
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:39,964
And it also has this wonderful effect of having the two-stage

782
00:37:39,964 --> 00:37:43,045
confirmation, because we could use a byte state to ask whether

783
00:37:43,045 --> 00:37:44,886
they were sure if they really wanted to exit.

784
00:37:44,886 --> 00:37:47,027
Otherwise, you could throw the rest of the burrito on the

785
00:37:47,027 --> 00:37:48,408
ground and continue going.

786
00:37:48,408 --> 00:37:51,209
And so this ended up being something that was referenced

787
00:37:51,209 --> 00:37:52,409
through a lot of people's designs.

788
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:56,331
And again, we joked and said, this is going in the textbooks.

789
00:37:56,331 --> 00:37:58,952
Everyone should exit their menus via a burrito.

790
00:37:58,952 --> 00:38:01,053
And it's just silly enough that it seems to work.

791
00:38:01,053 --> 00:38:03,754
I'm hoping it becomes a term, the same thing as a radio

792
00:38:03,754 --> 00:38:04,155
button, right?

793
00:38:04,155 --> 00:38:05,535
It's like, exit burrito.

794
00:38:08,432 --> 00:38:12,554
When it comes to menus, early we talked about that job bots

795
00:38:12,554 --> 00:38:13,834
office that ended up getting cut.

796
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:16,235
We knew we needed some sort of location that you could end up

797
00:38:16,235 --> 00:38:17,936
branching off into individual jobs.

798
00:38:17,936 --> 00:38:21,217
And then we ended up coming up with the premise that the idea

799
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:25,399
of a museum tribute to these past jobs was born.

800
00:38:25,399 --> 00:38:27,380
But this ended up playing another role

801
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,020
as a hidden tutorial.

802
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,700
So this is the progression.

803
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,461
So the job bot there, he floats over to you when you first

804
00:38:37,461 --> 00:38:39,823
start the game and passes you a business card.

805
00:38:39,823 --> 00:38:42,205
So you're now learning how to play the game.

806
00:38:42,205 --> 00:38:43,927
So you'll have to reach out and grab this card.

807
00:38:43,927 --> 00:38:45,588
So we teach pick up.

808
00:38:45,588 --> 00:38:47,750
Now we've teach that there's a small print on that, that

809
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,072
people will bring it to their face and read it.

810
00:38:49,072 --> 00:38:51,074
And we've told them some story and showed them how to

811
00:38:51,074 --> 00:38:52,495
actually interact with the world.

812
00:38:52,495 --> 00:38:54,096
The next thing is options.

813
00:38:54,096 --> 00:38:55,898
So we've got these cartridges that they can pick up.

814
00:38:56,398 --> 00:39:01,481
We then teach attach points by having to attach it onto the console.

815
00:39:01,481 --> 00:39:06,864
And then finally here we teach pullable levers and other things that interact from a fixed point.

816
00:39:06,864 --> 00:39:10,226
And so through this whole process that's really quick and intuitive,

817
00:39:10,226 --> 00:39:14,488
we've actually taught most of the core systems inside Job Simulator

818
00:39:14,488 --> 00:39:16,949
before you actually even get into the point of playing.

819
00:39:16,949 --> 00:39:18,430
And no one would treat this like a tutorial.

820
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:22,052
It's like, no, this is how you start the game, but it actually is at a fundamental level.

821
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:23,012
a tutorial.

822
00:39:23,012 --> 00:39:25,413
So there's one more insidious little tutorial point

823
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:27,833
that's hidden in there, is that when you get the card,

824
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:30,694
there's no table around you to put the card down on.

825
00:39:30,694 --> 00:39:32,554
And so people are like, hmm.

826
00:39:32,554 --> 00:39:34,875
And then they usually just throw it.

827
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:37,736
And we're trying to get people to start breaking

828
00:39:37,736 --> 00:39:40,436
the rules right away, so maybe they'll throw it at JobBot,

829
00:39:40,436 --> 00:39:41,556
maybe they'll throw it on the ground,

830
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:43,437
or maybe they'll do something with it

831
00:39:43,437 --> 00:39:46,798
because there's no outlet for this thing you just got

832
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:47,898
and now what do I do?

833
00:39:47,898 --> 00:39:49,318
So hopefully they'll start breaking the rules

834
00:39:49,318 --> 00:39:50,118
and start going nuts.

835
00:39:53,008 --> 00:39:57,011
Performance and frame rate, as I mentioned, are a huge concern in VR.

836
00:39:57,011 --> 00:40:01,895
From the very early days, we realized that an art style was going to have to be picked,

837
00:40:01,895 --> 00:40:04,677
chosen that would work really well with performance.

838
00:40:04,677 --> 00:40:06,939
And that's why we picked the art style of Job Simulator,

839
00:40:06,939 --> 00:40:11,403
is so that we could build a game that was highly performant.

840
00:40:11,663 --> 00:40:14,746
We were lucky in the case that we ended up building a lot of

841
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,368
mobile games prior to this.

842
00:40:16,368 --> 00:40:19,010
And so we did that with Unity.

843
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:20,792
And so we had learned all these different

844
00:40:20,792 --> 00:40:22,534
optimization techniques.

845
00:40:22,534 --> 00:40:24,756
So if you're actually going through some VR stuff from a

846
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,998
performance standpoint, it actually is beneficial to look

847
00:40:26,998 --> 00:40:29,801
at some of the mobile stuff that was done in the past,

848
00:40:29,801 --> 00:40:32,384
because some of those exact same optimizations actually

849
00:40:32,384 --> 00:40:33,405
carry over.

850
00:40:33,966 --> 00:40:36,589
So if you're interested on hearing some more performance

851
00:40:36,589 --> 00:40:39,493
related tips, because that's once again another talk, we

852
00:40:39,493 --> 00:40:41,456
ended up giving a multi-platform VR talk at

853
00:40:41,456 --> 00:40:42,097
Vision Summit 2016.

854
00:40:42,097 --> 00:40:43,259
That's up online.

855
00:40:45,603 --> 00:40:49,104
So at this point, we had gone through the process.

856
00:40:49,104 --> 00:40:51,324
Remember, we originally thought there was going to be 10 jobs.

857
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:54,245
It turned out we launched day one on the Vive,

858
00:40:54,245 --> 00:40:57,045
and were bundled with the Vive, which was super, super awesome.

859
00:40:57,045 --> 00:40:58,786
And we ended up shipping with four jobs,

860
00:40:58,786 --> 00:41:01,887
because we realized that people wanted much more depth

861
00:41:01,887 --> 00:41:04,267
in the environments that they were in, rather than

862
00:41:04,267 --> 00:41:07,168
an incredibly wide variety or breadth of environments.

863
00:41:07,168 --> 00:41:09,608
So that's just something that we found through play testing,

864
00:41:09,608 --> 00:41:11,329
is people wanted to go deeper and deeper

865
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:12,849
and find more and more things in that world,

866
00:41:12,849 --> 00:41:15,450
rather than just have lots of worlds that scratch the surface.

867
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:24,201
We also launched day one on PlayStation VR. Huge challenge when it came to perf, especially being CPU bound.

868
00:41:24,201 --> 00:41:30,308
There was a challenge of having to redesign play spaces like we talked about with the various sizes.

869
00:41:30,308 --> 00:41:34,874
But we have now a very known camera frustum that we can calculate exactly where.

870
00:41:35,174 --> 00:41:37,795
you can reach things and where you go out of bounds.

871
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:41,176
And so again, hard mode for us was we couldn't scale our world

872
00:41:41,176 --> 00:41:45,417
or do anything crazy like that because it's a real life place.

873
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:47,758
So hard mode was manually rebuild levels

874
00:41:47,758 --> 00:41:49,498
to be very specific so that everyone

875
00:41:49,498 --> 00:41:51,199
has an amazing, great time.

876
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:53,239
They never have to reach out of tracking

877
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:55,980
or see this awesome, shiny object, and then they reach

878
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,840
and they can't get it.

879
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,024
So a lot of work there to design around that.

880
00:42:00,024 --> 00:42:02,226
And then, yeah, we did another whole talk

881
00:42:02,226 --> 00:42:06,351
on the process of bringing Job Simulator to PlayStation VR,

882
00:42:06,351 --> 00:42:08,793
which was at Unite 2016, which is up online

883
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:09,514
and you can check out.

884
00:42:11,208 --> 00:42:15,912
So PSVR was also a big risk for us in the sense that we were

885
00:42:15,912 --> 00:42:20,396
building for this high end of two track controllers and we

886
00:42:20,396 --> 00:42:23,599
didn't know at the time that we decided, yeah, let's go forward

887
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,721
with PlayStation, whether move controllers would be packed in

888
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:31,105
with all SKUs. And we knew that in general, a controller that's

889
00:42:31,105 --> 00:42:34,307
not shipped in the box is a subsegment of a subsegment of a

890
00:42:34,307 --> 00:42:37,330
market that's early. So it turned out that

891
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:39,976
Launching on PlayStation was an incredible thing,

892
00:42:39,976 --> 00:42:41,439
and we're very proud of that.

893
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:43,825
But in the beginning, it was a really tough decision to make.

894
00:42:43,825 --> 00:42:46,492
Are they even going to have controllers?

895
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:51,300
and so yeah it ended up that we were the number one selling VR game on the

896
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:57,624
PlayStation Store in all of 2016, which was incredible and for us it was also

897
00:42:57,624 --> 00:43:02,026
like vindicating in the sense that with Job Simulator and Batman right at the

898
00:43:02,026 --> 00:43:06,629
top it proved that all of our prior notions of people want hands, people

899
00:43:06,629 --> 00:43:09,931
want to reach out and grab things and manipulate directly with their hands

900
00:43:09,931 --> 00:43:13,554
that that was true and that the numbers finally proved it so that was that was

901
00:43:13,554 --> 00:43:14,174
really cool to see.

902
00:43:15,646 --> 00:43:17,808
And that's what I just wrote on the slide.

903
00:43:17,808 --> 00:43:18,408
So Oculus Touch came next.

904
00:43:18,408 --> 00:43:20,410
So we were also day one there.

905
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,852
You can see here we implemented fingers.

906
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:28,816
So you can do finger guns and pointed things.

907
00:43:28,816 --> 00:43:30,117
It's pretty cool.

908
00:43:30,117 --> 00:43:32,219
So this was our third launch of 2016.

909
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:36,302
And this ended up representing the trifecta being complete,

910
00:43:36,302 --> 00:43:38,663
that we ended up shipping day one all three platforms that

911
00:43:38,663 --> 00:43:39,424
we had targeted.

912
00:43:42,477 --> 00:43:45,819
So these three platforms, we decided that we wanted to be

913
00:43:45,819 --> 00:43:49,020
everywhere that had hands, tracked hands and a tracked

914
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,921
head, and we were very careful to not fall into the

915
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:54,982
exclusivity trap and lock ourselves to one particular

916
00:43:54,982 --> 00:43:57,663
place, because we think it's super, super beneficial for the

917
00:43:57,663 --> 00:44:00,024
industry for as much content to be on as many

918
00:44:00,024 --> 00:44:01,205
platforms as possible.

919
00:44:03,399 --> 00:44:13,944
When it came to marketing, it was very important for us to be there day one at launch, but it was just as important to make sure that we were ready to build demos for conferences.

920
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:29,110
Because all this hardware was so early and we were all on the bleeding edge of what was working, we ended up having to devote a lot of resources on a moment's notice to build demos for different conferences, because we realized that this marketing effort not only was beneficial for us, but it was beneficial for the platform.

921
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:31,656
and pushing the entire medium forward.

922
00:44:31,656 --> 00:44:34,181
This meant that we had super short lead times on things

923
00:44:34,181 --> 00:44:36,065
and needed to be very careful in our development

924
00:44:36,065 --> 00:44:38,830
that we didn't all of a sudden run out of resources

925
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:40,333
and weren't being able to ship the game.

926
00:44:42,288 --> 00:44:49,212
We also ended up giving away the demo to all developers on Touch and on Vive.

927
00:44:49,212 --> 00:44:53,775
And that was really scary because it was early versions and we didn't know what would happen

928
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:56,737
and we're giving our game away to thousands of people.

929
00:44:56,737 --> 00:44:59,619
But it was really good for a lot of reasons.

930
00:44:59,619 --> 00:45:01,440
You know, that we ended up making sure that...

931
00:45:01,962 --> 00:45:04,805
people could see the way that we were attempting to do things

932
00:45:04,805 --> 00:45:05,927
and we wanted to see the reverse.

933
00:45:05,927 --> 00:45:07,469
We want to see how other people are trying to do things

934
00:45:07,469 --> 00:45:09,872
and sharing content was so important

935
00:45:09,872 --> 00:45:11,313
because when you get the hardware

936
00:45:11,313 --> 00:45:12,976
and there's literally nothing,

937
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:16,120
it's really hard to know if there's any best practices,

938
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,101
what are other people tried,

939
00:45:17,101 --> 00:45:18,743
and you could save time and not trip

940
00:45:18,743 --> 00:45:20,185
over the same mistakes as everyone else.

941
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:26,633
So when it came to actually showing the game in video form,

942
00:45:26,633 --> 00:45:28,335
that's one of the biggest challenges of VR,

943
00:45:28,335 --> 00:45:30,437
is that it's amazing on your face,

944
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:32,799
and then in the 2D view, it's kind of hard to represent

945
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,121
what's really going on and what's magical about it.

946
00:45:35,121 --> 00:45:38,664
So it just looked like people inside of a weird job

947
00:45:38,664 --> 00:45:39,665
throwing things.

948
00:45:39,665 --> 00:45:42,948
And so we ended up making these four mini-trailers

949
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,350
before making the actual launch trailer.

950
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:47,272
And the mini-trailers, which are...

951
00:45:47,852 --> 00:45:51,394
Basically, they would show super over-the-top gameplay

952
00:45:51,394 --> 00:45:53,755
with throwing physics around and juggling

953
00:45:53,755 --> 00:45:57,337
and trying to catch something in the air behind our back

954
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,297
and all these things.

955
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,958
And that was very specific

956
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:02,339
because the over-the-top physics madness

957
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:06,061
read very well as kind of this frenetic, weird game.

958
00:46:06,061 --> 00:46:09,262
Whereas, that's not how people normally are playing.

959
00:46:09,262 --> 00:46:10,643
It's just, it's good on film.

960
00:46:10,643 --> 00:46:14,925
And then, thanks to Kurt, we got the launch trailer

961
00:46:14,925 --> 00:46:16,426
with integrated mixed reality.

962
00:46:16,726 --> 00:46:18,630
which was like a first of its kind.

963
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:19,973
No one had done this kind of stuff.

964
00:46:19,973 --> 00:46:23,439
And so filming it with the fantastic contraption guys,

965
00:46:23,439 --> 00:46:25,924
it was a really big moment and it was really awesome.

966
00:46:25,924 --> 00:46:26,606
And then from a...

967
00:46:28,207 --> 00:46:30,827
Another like showing the game marketing standpoint,

968
00:46:30,827 --> 00:46:34,789
getting Let's Players started to attach to this game

969
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:36,049
in an incredible way.

970
00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:38,210
And so we built in spectator mode support

971
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:40,130
so that you can get a third person camera

972
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,471
and watch yourself externally,

973
00:46:41,471 --> 00:46:43,331
because when you look around

974
00:46:43,331 --> 00:46:46,092
with just the unwarped eye shown on a screen,

975
00:46:46,092 --> 00:46:47,793
it's really hard to kind of get the sense

976
00:46:47,793 --> 00:46:50,734
and people's heads move so quickly, it's hard to watch.

977
00:46:50,734 --> 00:46:52,974
So building that in really helped people.

978
00:46:52,974 --> 00:46:56,235
Adding built-in Twitch support was also really helpful

979
00:46:56,235 --> 00:46:57,376
for people in VR.

980
00:46:57,916 --> 00:47:02,519
to understand what their Twitch stream chat was, what was going on in the chat.

981
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:06,802
So all of that I think helped contribute to the ability for people to show our game, which was

982
00:47:06,802 --> 00:47:09,765
our marketing, is make it as easy as possible for people to show your game.

983
00:47:11,937 --> 00:47:18,764
The launch reception for Job Simulator was fantastic. People really loved it. The thing is, we got lower

984
00:47:18,764 --> 00:47:24,470
ratings from traditional game reviewers in the very early days. So the IGNs and game informers

985
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:30,776
of the world. There was a lot of complaint about price in the early days. We launched at $40. We

986
00:47:30,776 --> 00:47:35,921
ended up changing it to $30 after a couple weeks. We didn't know what market

987
00:47:36,121 --> 00:47:41,602
expectations would be. What would people pay for content? Where's the ecosystem? Where are we in

988
00:47:41,602 --> 00:47:46,343
relative price to everyone else? No one knew. We didn't all get together and talk about our price.

989
00:47:46,343 --> 00:47:50,744
We just had to come up with something and put it out there. And so the thing is, we were being

990
00:47:50,744 --> 00:47:57,626
compared to traditional PC games with 40-hour gameplay and $10, $20 million budgets or whatever

991
00:47:57,626 --> 00:48:00,847
they were, like all budgets. Whereas...

992
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:03,993
that that was the only thing we can compare to is only a couple of your

993
00:48:03,993 --> 00:48:07,599
games and so how else can you base your reviews you just go off of a previous

994
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:11,605
medium and that's really hard to live up to that kind of uh... length of time

995
00:48:11,605 --> 00:48:11,685
and

996
00:48:12,712 --> 00:48:19,137
quality bar. The reception today, however, we were receiving actually higher reviews than we

997
00:48:19,137 --> 00:48:24,702
were at launch and there's little to no price complaints, just the expected amount of

998
00:48:24,702 --> 00:48:30,646
internet complaints that you get in a video game. And we're winning fantastic awards or

999
00:48:30,646 --> 00:48:33,749
have been nominated for them, which is awesome.

1000
00:48:34,429 --> 00:48:37,570
being early to market has incredible advantages,

1001
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,111
but it's also really, really hard

1002
00:48:39,111 --> 00:48:41,351
because the developers are new to this,

1003
00:48:41,351 --> 00:48:42,932
the press are new to it,

1004
00:48:42,932 --> 00:48:45,613
and they have nothing to compare to,

1005
00:48:45,613 --> 00:48:47,073
and consumers also don't really necessarily

1006
00:48:47,073 --> 00:48:49,514
have expectations because who knows

1007
00:48:49,514 --> 00:48:50,874
what's gonna happen when they get VR,

1008
00:48:50,874 --> 00:48:53,335
so we're all just kind of learning together

1009
00:48:53,335 --> 00:48:54,575
how this all comes together.

1010
00:48:56,602 --> 00:49:03,026
Our predictions in the early days were that because this was a PC-based VR system with

1011
00:49:03,026 --> 00:49:08,289
the Vive and you needed a lot of expensive hardware, that this was going to skew towards

1012
00:49:08,289 --> 00:49:13,391
a demographic that had a lot of expendable income, that PC gamer, which generally skews

1013
00:49:13,391 --> 00:49:16,273
more younger male, was going to be the market.

1014
00:49:16,273 --> 00:49:19,334
And that market was very shooter-driven audience.

1015
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:23,598
We chose to not target that market specifically and

1016
00:49:23,598 --> 00:49:26,800
instead build our game for everyone.

1017
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,942
But why did we end up doing this?

1018
00:49:28,942 --> 00:49:34,246
We realized that the year one use case for VR was going to

1019
00:49:34,246 --> 00:49:36,588
be that the actual hardware owner, the person that went

1020
00:49:36,588 --> 00:49:39,110
out and bought the system, wasn't going to be the player

1021
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:41,792
that was going to play our games the most amount of the

1022
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:44,874
time, that once you end up buying this hardware, no one's

1023
00:49:44,874 --> 00:49:46,855
going to take the hardware, be like, this is super awesome,

1024
00:49:46,855 --> 00:49:48,917
and then hide it in their closet from everyone.

1025
00:49:49,217 --> 00:49:55,439
Everybody wants people to come over and play and show their significant others and their families and their friends and hold parties

1026
00:49:55,439 --> 00:50:00,040
and then spectate this and put it up on YouTube and all that kind of sharing stuff.

1027
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:04,721
So we wanted to build the game so it worked for everyone

1028
00:50:04,721 --> 00:50:10,282
because we think that VR is for everyone and we don't want this medium to fall into mistakes of previous mediums.

1029
00:50:10,282 --> 00:50:15,883
VR is truly for everyone and we have to work really hard to make sure that that actually becomes reality.

1030
00:50:17,344 --> 00:50:20,128
VR is the most accessible platform ever made.

1031
00:50:20,128 --> 00:50:22,191
In Job Simulator there's literally two buttons.

1032
00:50:22,191 --> 00:50:24,273
Everyone's been interacting with the world with their hands

1033
00:50:24,273 --> 00:50:26,616
their entire lives, so that they end up getting that

1034
00:50:26,616 --> 00:50:28,799
and it makes it super easy for them to interact.

1035
00:50:30,397 --> 00:50:33,579
So, the overall question of a post-mortem is,

1036
00:50:33,579 --> 00:50:35,240
was Job Simulator a success?

1037
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:39,983
And so from a financial metric standpoint, yes.

1038
00:50:39,983 --> 00:50:42,525
Pulling in over three million in sales in 2016

1039
00:50:42,525 --> 00:50:45,346
well exceeded our expectations, I think.

1040
00:50:45,346 --> 00:50:48,769
Getting great reception and being in the right spot

1041
00:50:48,769 --> 00:50:51,470
and being super early meant that we were able

1042
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:52,771
to have a financial success.

1043
00:50:52,771 --> 00:50:54,733
The game's still selling well.

1044
00:50:54,733 --> 00:50:56,434
And so there's other metrics to success.

1045
00:50:56,434 --> 00:50:58,235
So, basically...

1046
00:50:59,236 --> 00:51:00,997
From an accessibility standpoint,

1047
00:51:00,997 --> 00:51:04,359
we were able to deliver on something that everyone can play

1048
00:51:04,359 --> 00:51:08,242
from the extremely young audience to people of all ages.

1049
00:51:08,242 --> 00:51:10,964
And that was, I think, one of our greatest successes

1050
00:51:10,964 --> 00:51:12,505
that everyone's able to play this game

1051
00:51:12,505 --> 00:51:13,865
and have a ton of fun all together.

1052
00:51:13,865 --> 00:51:16,887
I think we delivered on hands and physics

1053
00:51:16,887 --> 00:51:18,368
because we focused so hard

1054
00:51:18,368 --> 00:51:21,110
on that one particular realm of VR.

1055
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:23,552
And I think from our standpoint, that was a success.

1056
00:51:23,552 --> 00:51:25,393
We could use this tech for our next game

1057
00:51:25,393 --> 00:51:28,355
and we were able to set a bar for hand interactions.

1058
00:51:29,315 --> 00:51:32,437
From a getting there early and being prevalent,

1059
00:51:32,437 --> 00:51:34,638
the name Job Simulator is widely known,

1060
00:51:34,638 --> 00:51:36,458
and so we feel like that was a success,

1061
00:51:36,458 --> 00:51:38,239
and one of our goals is to have something

1062
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:40,740
that everyone had tried in VR.

1063
00:51:40,740 --> 00:51:42,641
From a humor standpoint, we think that

1064
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:45,442
there's not many games out there, or companies still,

1065
00:51:45,442 --> 00:51:47,583
that try to push really hard into humor in games

1066
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,884
and don't take themselves too seriously.

1067
00:51:49,884 --> 00:51:52,485
So we wanted to continue our trend as Alchemy

1068
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:54,425
to do things that weren't super, super serious.

1069
00:51:54,425 --> 00:51:56,926
So I think, hopefully, some of the jokes

1070
00:51:56,926 --> 00:51:58,427
landed in Job Simulator, so we think that

1071
00:51:58,427 --> 00:51:58,627
that's a...

1072
00:51:59,227 --> 00:52:02,311
reasonable success. And then from a shareability standpoint,

1073
00:52:02,311 --> 00:52:07,176
I think we made it easy for people to share the game and

1074
00:52:07,176 --> 00:52:11,380
show it to others because that's one of the biggest challenges in

1075
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,963
VR. And from a social standpoint, I think that we

1076
00:52:13,963 --> 00:52:17,146
pushed in that direction and had some success there. And so very

1077
00:52:17,146 --> 00:52:21,010
proud of that. Thank you. And we would love to take questions.

1078
00:52:29,092 --> 00:52:31,393
So there's mics on the left and right.

1079
00:52:31,393 --> 00:52:34,034
Hello.

1080
00:52:34,034 --> 00:52:38,156
I love what you said about the affordances and stuff you

1081
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:39,636
added with playtesting.

1082
00:52:39,636 --> 00:52:43,938
About what percentage of your development time do you think

1083
00:52:43,938 --> 00:52:46,879
was, oh, players want to do this, we have

1084
00:52:46,879 --> 00:52:48,420
to make that work? 100%.

1085
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,101
All right, so plan a lot.

1086
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:53,482
It starts with the developers saying, oh, I want to do this.

1087
00:52:53,482 --> 00:52:55,163
And then we get through as much as we can.

1088
00:52:55,163 --> 00:52:57,023
And then we go, OK, well, what else is there?

1089
00:52:57,023 --> 00:52:58,184
And then playtesters play.

1090
00:52:58,184 --> 00:53:00,685
I would say the second half of development

1091
00:53:00,685 --> 00:53:03,486
was much more focused on reactionary fixes,

1092
00:53:03,486 --> 00:53:06,327
because you want this process to be smooth for every person who

1093
00:53:06,327 --> 00:53:07,227
plays.

1094
00:53:07,227 --> 00:53:09,788
So your task list of what you wanted to do

1095
00:53:09,788 --> 00:53:12,570
kind of has to be second priority to what is coming up

1096
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:13,910
as notes through playtests.

1097
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:17,491
So it's a trajectory of the end of the game development

1098
00:53:17,491 --> 00:53:19,112
is all about what users are saying.

1099
00:53:19,492 --> 00:53:21,754
and the early part is what we think might be good.

1100
00:53:21,754 --> 00:53:23,815
So definitely budget a lot of time for that.

1101
00:53:23,815 --> 00:53:29,838
Oh yeah, like this is the first platform where you have super infinite amount of input.

1102
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:32,700
It's not like, oh I'm going over to a table and I'm hitting the A button and I'm like,

1103
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,582
yeah, you could have the choice of an A button or a B button.

1104
00:53:35,582 --> 00:53:39,764
It's like, you have the choice of doing anything with your hands at any moment in time.

1105
00:53:40,024 --> 00:53:44,788
Yeah, and we didn't even get into the QA aspect, which would have, in our previous talks, took another half hour.

1106
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:51,713
But like, we had people stick their face into a vending machine in the office and eat the items out of the vending machine.

1107
00:53:51,713 --> 00:53:55,576
Like, there's so many things you could do in 3D space that you wouldn't expect,

1108
00:53:55,576 --> 00:53:58,698
that as a developer, it's like, I didn't try that, but someone did.

1109
00:53:58,698 --> 00:54:02,020
That there's so much you'll get from playtesting.

1110
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:02,501
Cool, thanks.

1111
00:54:03,703 --> 00:54:11,011
Hi, congratulations on the game. You mentioned that sales are still strong. In the last, I don't

1112
00:54:11,011 --> 00:54:14,554
know, maybe two months or something like that, can you say how much it's split between the

1113
00:54:14,554 --> 00:54:20,000
platforms? Like how strong are you selling in like each, you know, PlayStation, Oculus and

1114
00:54:20,642 --> 00:54:27,084
So there's so many NDAs when it comes to sharing sales numbers, it was actually really difficult for us to share any number.

1115
00:54:27,084 --> 00:54:27,324
Okay.

1116
00:54:27,324 --> 00:54:35,247
So we were able to aggregate all of our sales into that 3 million number, but we're not able to basically split it up or sub-portion it.

1117
00:54:35,247 --> 00:54:36,347
Okay, got it, thanks.

1118
00:54:36,347 --> 00:54:36,508
Yeah.

1119
00:54:36,508 --> 00:54:46,271
So, this has to do with playtesting and, you know, the challenges of getting your game out there to people because the VR market's so small. How did you guys, like, tackle...

1120
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:51,746
getting a broad amount of information to analyze and kind

1121
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:56,327
of adapt your game based upon that input. Yeah, so basically

1122
00:54:56,327 --> 00:55:03,788
is your question how did you take everything you learned from

1123
00:55:03,788 --> 00:55:08,949
a play test and turn it into actionable results? How did you

1124
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:12,650
get your play testing out to a larger crowd to kind of

1125
00:55:13,173 --> 00:55:16,774
get more data to effect.

1126
00:55:16,774 --> 00:55:20,415
So we, the VR hardware at the time

1127
00:55:20,415 --> 00:55:21,676
that we were doing all this development,

1128
00:55:21,676 --> 00:55:22,456
it wasn't everywhere.

1129
00:55:22,456 --> 00:55:24,257
We couldn't just send builds to everyone

1130
00:55:24,257 --> 00:55:27,338
and say run this on your PC and let us know how it goes.

1131
00:55:27,338 --> 00:55:29,078
We had to have a constant flow of people

1132
00:55:29,078 --> 00:55:30,839
coming into our office,

1133
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:32,839
and then we needed to specifically spend time

1134
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:35,640
and schedule blocks of time to sit there.

1135
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,722
and not hire someone who was like the playtest coordinator.

1136
00:55:38,722 --> 00:55:41,024
We needed the actual developers and designers

1137
00:55:41,024 --> 00:55:43,446
sitting there and watching the players go through

1138
00:55:43,446 --> 00:55:47,008
these playtests because, yeah, you could take notes on

1139
00:55:47,008 --> 00:55:51,371
person did X, but the one who developed that interaction.

1140
00:55:51,831 --> 00:55:54,092
if they watch someone interact with it

1141
00:55:54,092 --> 00:55:55,672
and do something wrong or hesitate

1142
00:55:55,672 --> 00:55:56,932
or the affordances aren't right,

1143
00:55:56,932 --> 00:55:58,833
they have to be the one who says,

1144
00:55:58,833 --> 00:56:00,273
oh, I think I get it.

1145
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:02,014
They went here, they didn't look at this item,

1146
00:56:02,014 --> 00:56:03,894
and then when they saw the slot machine arm,

1147
00:56:03,894 --> 00:56:05,995
they didn't know whether they should twist it or turn it,

1148
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:06,835
and then they could use that

1149
00:56:06,835 --> 00:56:08,655
to go directly make those changes.

1150
00:56:08,655 --> 00:56:10,456
So it just needs to be a very tight loop

1151
00:56:10,456 --> 00:56:12,136
between developer and tester,

1152
00:56:12,136 --> 00:56:13,797
such that they are the same person,

1153
00:56:13,797 --> 00:56:16,177
and then just sit there and physically watch and take notes.

1154
00:56:16,277 --> 00:56:19,099
And even with the hardware being readily available, we

1155
00:56:19,099 --> 00:56:22,382
still do a vast majority of our playtesting in-house, just

1156
00:56:22,382 --> 00:56:25,805
because watching people and seeing their actual reactions

1157
00:56:25,805 --> 00:56:26,886
is super important.

1158
00:56:26,886 --> 00:56:29,127
We ended up having some external playtests where they

1159
00:56:29,127 --> 00:56:31,229
ended up playtesting and recording themselves play.

1160
00:56:31,229 --> 00:56:34,191
But we discovered that even then, we had to then sit down

1161
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:37,754
and watch an hour or whatever the playtest length of video

1162
00:56:37,754 --> 00:56:40,637
anyway, so why not just have them in the office?

1163
00:56:40,637 --> 00:56:43,259
And the feedback we get from people playing externally is

1164
00:56:43,259 --> 00:56:44,019
more challenging.

1165
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,101
And one of the reasons for this, I think, is that, say,

1166
00:56:47,101 --> 00:56:49,542
you're playtesting someone's game, at least when I do that,

1167
00:56:49,542 --> 00:56:52,784
I have a notepad beside me, or I have some sort of browser.

1168
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,785
And when I go in, I'm like, oh, man, that's kind of weird.

1169
00:56:54,785 --> 00:56:55,926
I go and write a note.

1170
00:56:55,926 --> 00:56:58,807
But when you're in VR, the process of writing a note is

1171
00:56:58,807 --> 00:57:00,909
actually super painful, because I'm in the middle of a great

1172
00:57:00,909 --> 00:57:03,050
experience, and then it's like, hey, take the headset

1173
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,931
off, put the controllers down, go over to my desk, make a

1174
00:57:04,931 --> 00:57:07,312
note, and I find myself falling into the trap of just

1175
00:57:07,312 --> 00:57:08,873
like, I'll remember that.

1176
00:57:08,873 --> 00:57:11,534
And you just almost never do, because the next time a new

1177
00:57:11,534 --> 00:57:14,316
thing comes up, that erases the previous item.

1178
00:57:14,316 --> 00:57:14,356
So.

1179
00:57:14,476 --> 00:57:16,777
So there's a lot of sometimes someone yelling,

1180
00:57:16,777 --> 00:57:19,158
someone open Trello, because they're in VR,

1181
00:57:19,158 --> 00:57:21,360
and they were like, write down in the triage column

1182
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,181
that blah, blah, blah is broken.

1183
00:57:23,181 --> 00:57:25,182
And that's the only real, like,

1184
00:57:25,182 --> 00:57:27,323
you could automate it or do something else, voice commands.

1185
00:57:27,323 --> 00:57:29,484
There's probably some tools you could build for that,

1186
00:57:29,484 --> 00:57:31,445
but you just need to get it written down

1187
00:57:31,445 --> 00:57:32,786
and our brains aren't good enough to remember

1188
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:35,087
all the problems that we play test through.

1189
00:57:35,087 --> 00:57:36,168
Thanks, guys.

1190
00:57:38,467 --> 00:57:41,028
Congratulations on your success.

1191
00:57:41,028 --> 00:57:43,069
I think maybe for a lot of us here,

1192
00:57:43,069 --> 00:57:47,151
it's pretty impressive to see your early Valve demo

1193
00:57:47,151 --> 00:57:50,193
that you did in a very short period of time.

1194
00:57:50,193 --> 00:57:52,034
Can you talk a little bit about,

1195
00:57:52,034 --> 00:57:55,496
especially with completely new hardware and new SDKs,

1196
00:57:55,496 --> 00:57:59,197
I mean, now we have like SteamVR, we have the Lab,

1197
00:57:59,197 --> 00:58:01,659
we have a ton of stuff on the Asset Store

1198
00:58:01,659 --> 00:58:04,580
that's available, at least in Unity.

1199
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,960
Early on when you started the Valve demo

1200
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,121
and you said you had a very short period of time,

1201
00:58:13,121 --> 00:58:14,301
can you talk about any of the support

1202
00:58:14,301 --> 00:58:16,682
that you might have received from Valve?

1203
00:58:16,682 --> 00:58:18,982
And also, even more importantly than that,

1204
00:58:18,982 --> 00:58:20,642
can you talk a little bit about

1205
00:58:20,642 --> 00:58:24,703
what kind of things you think set you up for success

1206
00:58:24,703 --> 00:58:28,424
for that demo, whether it's the team that you already had

1207
00:58:28,424 --> 00:58:30,944
or how did you build your team, anything like that?

1208
00:58:30,944 --> 00:58:34,745
So, yeah, I mean...

1209
00:58:35,485 --> 00:58:39,828
basically just getting the hardware on time and having them put a lot of trust

1210
00:58:39,828 --> 00:58:44,851
into us was the key parts of it. It really came down to the fact that this

1211
00:58:44,851 --> 00:58:50,255
was, we had done many years of mobile optimization and we had built games as a

1212
00:58:50,255 --> 00:58:53,917
team together. We'd been through that original IP cycle four or five times.

1213
00:58:53,917 --> 00:58:58,080
And so we could sit down and throw out everything we'd ever learned about game

1214
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,981
design and say, what works with this hardware?

1215
00:59:00,481 --> 00:59:02,802
And that was really the design process.

1216
00:59:02,802 --> 00:59:05,563
There's not much you could do to prepare someone for this

1217
00:59:05,563 --> 00:59:08,084
because it took two years to come together

1218
00:59:08,084 --> 00:59:10,585
and figure out what some of the lessons learned were

1219
00:59:10,585 --> 00:59:12,426
and yet none of those existed at that time.

1220
00:59:12,426 --> 00:59:15,987
So it was just give us the hardware, give us some time,

1221
00:59:15,987 --> 00:59:18,208
and see what comes out of it.

1222
00:59:18,208 --> 00:59:20,008
And that was their challenge.

1223
00:59:20,008 --> 00:59:22,529
Their challenge is we don't know who might do cool stuff.

1224
00:59:22,529 --> 00:59:25,050
It might be this lone person in their basement

1225
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:27,691
comes up with the greatest idea in VR of all time.

1226
00:59:27,691 --> 00:59:28,932
It's a really big challenge.

1227
00:59:30,032 --> 00:59:33,655
and just them getting dev hardware out to as many people as possible

1228
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:36,696
is probably the best thing you could do as a platform to solve that.

1229
00:59:36,696 --> 00:59:40,579
From our standpoint, the mobile and PC stuff we did before was super helpful.

1230
00:59:40,579 --> 00:59:42,900
But another thing that ended up leading to this was

1231
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,822
we never made the same type of game twice.

1232
00:59:45,822 --> 00:59:48,163
It was like every game, we finished it and we're like,

1233
00:59:48,163 --> 00:59:50,605
what is radically different after this?

1234
00:59:50,605 --> 00:59:52,806
And this caused us to kind of always be in that mindset

1235
00:59:52,806 --> 00:59:56,208
of just like throwing out your previous conceptions on things

1236
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:58,049
and kind of going at things a different direction,

1237
00:59:58,049 --> 00:59:59,190
which is like super, super important.

1238
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:00,070
important in VR.

1239
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:05,514
Whereas if we had built four shooters in a row previously and that was all the design

1240
01:00:05,514 --> 01:00:11,057
focus we'd had previously, it would be really hard to sit down and say, okay, let's make

1241
01:00:11,057 --> 01:00:12,138
a game about blocks.

1242
01:00:12,138 --> 01:00:16,861
You just kind of want to go in a direction you've been comfortable with and our history

1243
01:00:16,861 --> 01:00:21,504
has been removing comfort from our game design and just starting at new things all the time.

1244
01:00:22,447 --> 01:00:24,869
Cool, and what was your team size for the Val thing,

1245
01:00:24,869 --> 01:00:25,750
just out of curiosity?

1246
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:26,791
Four people.

1247
01:00:26,791 --> 01:00:28,673
Okay, cool, thank you very much.

1248
01:00:28,673 --> 01:00:31,737
And then we grew to 16 by the end of Job Simulator,

1249
01:00:31,737 --> 01:00:34,480
and then since Job Simulator, we're now at 25.

1250
01:00:35,267 --> 01:00:35,787
Great, thanks.

1251
01:00:35,787 --> 01:00:37,868
I had a similar question to him,

1252
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:39,649
so I'll just thank you for the game because.

1253
01:00:39,649 --> 01:00:40,129
It's time.

1254
01:00:40,129 --> 01:00:40,269
Oh, sorry.

1255
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:40,670
We done?

1256
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:41,890
I think we're getting the time,

1257
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:43,471
but what was your question?

1258
01:00:43,471 --> 01:00:45,832
We'll do it like a 10-second version.

1259
01:00:45,832 --> 01:00:47,032
I was just gonna say thank you,

1260
01:00:47,032 --> 01:00:48,773
because the first thing my four-year-old did

1261
01:00:48,773 --> 01:00:50,694
when he played the game was pick up a bottle of wine,

1262
01:00:50,694 --> 01:00:53,375
guzzle it, smash the bottle,

1263
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,096
and then try and kill the job bot with it.

1264
01:00:55,096 --> 01:00:57,437
So thank you for that terrifying vision

1265
01:00:57,437 --> 01:00:59,478
of my child's future.

1266
01:00:59,478 --> 01:01:01,559
It was great, thank you.

1267
01:01:03,706 --> 01:01:05,690
All right, that is the end.

1268
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:08,376
Make sure to fill out your evaluations, and thank you

1269
01:01:08,376 --> 01:01:08,897
very much.
