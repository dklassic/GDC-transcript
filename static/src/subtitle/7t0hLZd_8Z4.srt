1
00:00:03,576 --> 00:00:03,816
Thank you.

2
00:00:04,677 --> 00:00:05,118
Thank you.

3
00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:07,400
All right.

4
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:10,763
First up, I have some housekeeping things.

5
00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:12,765
Silence your cell phones.

6
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:17,049
And don't forget your evaluations that are probably emailed to you after you got buzzed

7
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:17,249
in.

8
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:21,393
So, yes, I am Matt Bain, as she said.

9
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:25,477
I am an animator at Blizzard Entertainment on Overwatch.

10
00:00:26,338 --> 00:00:28,520
So, last year, Dave Gibson, who's over there.

11
00:00:30,582 --> 00:00:37,144
He gave a kick-ass talk about how we find and animate the core of a character from start to finish.

12
00:00:37,164 --> 00:00:40,105
I don't know if that's still on.

13
00:00:41,245 --> 00:00:47,527
And it was awesome. It was a little fuller talk. You've probably seen it if you were here last year or it was released onto YouTube.

14
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:50,728
So I'm sure many of you have seen it. If not, I highly recommend it.

15
00:00:51,588 --> 00:00:56,570
Later this week on Thursday, Jesse Davis, who's also sheepishly hiding over there.

16
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:02,024
is doing a talk on the pipeline of animation on Overwatch.

17
00:01:02,344 --> 00:01:05,486
So that'll dig in a little more to the technical process

18
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:07,528
in-engine, all sorts of great stuff.

19
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:10,450
So not to step on their toes, this talk

20
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,812
is specifically about first-person animation.

21
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:20,398
So it's basically how we go from that to that.

22
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,179
Yeah, hi, D.Va.

23
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:25,702
So first-person animation.

24
00:01:27,097 --> 00:01:32,519
My core thesis today is to talk about how we maintain the character, because Overwatch

25
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:33,340
is about the heroes.

26
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:41,264
How do we maintain that character as we go from this fun character design into hands

27
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:42,525
and a gun and a camera?

28
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:48,027
There is some trepidation when people jump into first-person animation because either

29
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:52,109
they're bored by it, because they don't really want to do it, or they don't really get it.

30
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:53,570
But it's...

31
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:57,953
I don't know, it's not that big of a deal.

32
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:00,455
First-person animation is actually a really great place

33
00:02:00,475 --> 00:02:02,056
to start if you're a gameplay animator,

34
00:02:02,496 --> 00:02:04,838
because it has everything a gameplay animator does.

35
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,960
It's very player-facing.

36
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,981
I mean, it's right there in your face.

37
00:02:11,323 --> 00:02:16,828
And they're looking past your animation at the target,

38
00:02:16,848 --> 00:02:17,668
so don't fret.

39
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:20,210
The animation, it's there, it's great.

40
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,231
As long as you're doing it well,

41
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:23,853
they're not gonna stare too closely at it.

42
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:27,929
But you also have the benefit of a locked off camera.

43
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:29,730
And no other gameplay animators can really

44
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,291
say they have the benefit of a locked off camera.

45
00:02:31,691 --> 00:02:33,633
So let's get going.

46
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:36,914
Gameplay first.

47
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:41,157
If you ever saw a talk by a Blizzard animator or Blizzard

48
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:44,018
developer on anything, I bet you they

49
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,499
have a slide that says gameplay first.

50
00:02:47,561 --> 00:02:50,722
This is enshrined in our card around our Orc.

51
00:02:53,695 --> 00:02:55,156
So there is a lot happening.

52
00:02:55,956 --> 00:02:57,117
There's a lot happening here.

53
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,800
It's flashy and fast and hella fun.

54
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:06,783
But the first person animator does not

55
00:03:06,824 --> 00:03:12,768
want to add to any visual noise of the way of the player.

56
00:03:13,488 --> 00:03:15,509
So they wanted to make your animation needs

57
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,330
to be responsive.

58
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:19,632
And you don't want to take too much control away

59
00:03:19,692 --> 00:03:20,253
from the player.

60
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:27,141
And you have to provide visceral feedback as well as gameplay feedback to ground them in the world that you've created.

61
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:34,705
And that world that we've made is this big, bright, colorful world.

62
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:37,927
As I said earlier, Overwatch is about the heroes.

63
00:03:39,268 --> 00:03:42,510
When I first started on the team in 2014 and they showed me this stuff,

64
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:44,632
they didn't have this many heroes when I started.

65
00:03:45,712 --> 00:03:47,093
And I looked at everything. I looked at...

66
00:03:47,873 --> 00:03:50,155
What I looked at actually was this.

67
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:53,160
They showed me these that they had already.

68
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:57,062
And I looked at it and I was like, that's amazing.

69
00:03:57,663 --> 00:04:01,004
That's an animator's dream to do all that sort of wacky stuff.

70
00:04:02,205 --> 00:04:04,446
And I thought, why are you making a first-person game?

71
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:06,407
This could be a wonderful third-person game.

72
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:13,912
But they're making a multiplayer shooter, which is great

73
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:15,532
because that's what I love to play.

74
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:18,874
So I took this.

75
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:23,418
from Dave Gibson who showed a very similar,

76
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:25,080
he actually showed all these slides last year

77
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,501
for good reason, they fit perfectly into his talk.

78
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:29,903
I just wanted to tell you that all of that,

79
00:04:30,944 --> 00:04:34,506
the overlapping action, overshoots, the squash and stretch,

80
00:04:34,646 --> 00:04:37,608
the snappy texture timing, all building up to appeal,

81
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:43,372
all of that translates into what we do in first person.

82
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:46,334
And this slide is also exactly what Dave showed last year.

83
00:04:47,235 --> 00:04:47,815
And because

84
00:04:49,576 --> 00:04:50,976
I'm sorry, I'm moving too much for this thing.

85
00:04:52,777 --> 00:04:55,878
Michael Biancolana kicked ass on this animation.

86
00:04:56,098 --> 00:04:56,638
I mean, look at it.

87
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:58,959
So it slowed down here at the end,

88
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,540
but it has everything there.

89
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,200
It has the snappiness.

90
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,041
It has some nice flow to it as well.

91
00:05:08,382 --> 00:05:12,403
Shoot all that secondary action of all the little fiddly bits

92
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:12,723
moving.

93
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:14,203
And I just love this animation so much.

94
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:18,092
which kind of bugs me because there was a so you're the guy

95
00:05:18,112 --> 00:05:20,655
that does first person overwatch you know my favorite

96
00:05:20,995 --> 00:05:21,996
first-person animation is

97
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:23,557
zanyata

98
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:25,999
like oak

99
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,400
yeah me too actually

100
00:05:28,902 --> 00:05:30,223
but that was michael bianca on a

101
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:35,385
Let's move on into the actual tech stuff.

102
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,225
So my talk is actually a little bit free flowing.

103
00:05:38,885 --> 00:05:39,986
Once I get to a certain point,

104
00:05:40,026 --> 00:05:41,626
I'm just gonna start showing you examples

105
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:42,806
and talking about fun stuff.

106
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:46,247
But first I just wanna show you what we're working with.

107
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:50,147
A lot of it's gonna seem kind of redundant

108
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,908
to people who've worked on shooters before.

109
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,768
But I think a lot of people might still get

110
00:05:54,828 --> 00:05:56,488
some fun joy out of seeing it.

111
00:05:58,089 --> 00:05:59,869
These are the rigs that we're working with.

112
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:02,866
It's a pared down version of third-person rigs.

113
00:06:03,926 --> 00:06:07,947
You can actually see here that we just

114
00:06:08,128 --> 00:06:10,028
take the third-person rig and cull out everything

115
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:10,868
that you're not going to see.

116
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:13,009
And the reason McCree still has his hat

117
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:15,810
is because he brings his hat down for his high noonl.

118
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,571
Anything the animator wants to add

119
00:06:20,071 --> 00:06:21,832
to the first person from the third-person rig,

120
00:06:21,872 --> 00:06:24,672
we can ask the riggers to leave that in.

121
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,573
If you want to learn more about how the rigs are built,

122
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:29,214
highly recommend you go to Jesse's talk.

123
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,801
on Thursday, but you can notice that he still has his root controller.

124
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:42,383
All the camera animation, primarily we animate from the root, even in first person.

125
00:06:43,544 --> 00:06:48,346
They do have another camera bone that we add accents with, just a little extra motion.

126
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:54,508
Nothing too heavy and extreme, that just sort of gives you a little extra feeling to ground you into the world.

127
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:57,390
And I'll talk more about camera stuff later.

128
00:06:59,107 --> 00:07:00,348
I just wanted to show you this example too.

129
00:07:01,609 --> 00:07:02,210
He has a leg.

130
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,033
He's the only hero that has a leg in first person at the

131
00:07:06,073 --> 00:07:11,278
moment, because Michael, when he animated Zenyatta, gave him

132
00:07:11,318 --> 00:07:15,021
a floating, he sort of does this Indian style sit and

133
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:16,462
floats in the air.

134
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:18,124
And he said, well, if he's floating, his legs are free.

135
00:07:18,164 --> 00:07:19,425
Why doesn't he just kick you in the face?

136
00:07:20,586 --> 00:07:22,908
So he asks, got the leg in there, and now he

137
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:23,688
kicks you in the face.

138
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:31,203
This is partly how we attach weapons.

139
00:07:31,263 --> 00:07:33,144
This is the classic way.

140
00:07:33,324 --> 00:07:35,726
Everybody who's ever attached a weapon in a game

141
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:36,867
probably has done it at first.

142
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:40,549
There's an attachment bone that is at the very bottom

143
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:42,350
of the arm chain.

144
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,491
I added the outliner from Maya just to show you

145
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:45,372
how deep it is.

146
00:07:46,972 --> 00:07:48,353
That attachment bone is under the hand.

147
00:07:49,612 --> 00:07:52,854
which is great that means when you attach a weapon is going to follow that

148
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:57,656
arm where it goes without having to I K you can I K the left hand to that bone

149
00:07:57,676 --> 00:08:02,258
too so that it all moves together without too much decent issues.

150
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:05,020
But there are cons to it as well.

151
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:10,082
This is 76 is prototype reload that I did.

152
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,563
So 76 if you're not familiar,

153
00:08:12,603 --> 00:08:17,246
soldier 76 is a Mr America captain America almost let's try.

154
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:18,586
I shouldn't say that he's.

155
00:08:20,935 --> 00:08:24,277
He's red, white and blue, gung ho, leader of the overwatch at

156
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:30,379
one point. So I thought, oh, top loading gun, top loading

157
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:34,101
reloads are tricky for me because you can get your hand in

158
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:36,662
the way of the camera so easy trying to reload that with the

159
00:08:36,702 --> 00:08:41,544
left hand. I know, what's the classic American infantryman's

160
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:45,626
weapon? And it's that World War II weapon, the M1 Garand, which

161
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,607
I realized I probably should put a photo of one of those up there

162
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,447
so you know what I'm talking about.

163
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:54,261
If you've ever seen a World War II movie, that classic gun that you're firing off and

164
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:58,364
you get that ping sound and everything kicks out, maybe some of you know, some of you would

165
00:08:58,384 --> 00:08:59,885
go, ooh, guns, gross.

166
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:02,106
But that's okay.

167
00:09:02,707 --> 00:09:09,031
So I thought, oh, I'll just slap a new magazine in with the right hand.

168
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:10,252
But what happens...

169
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:13,293
It's parented to that bone that's

170
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,453
at the bottom of this chain.

171
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:17,234
So this prototype animation in Maya looks fine.

172
00:09:17,274 --> 00:09:18,394
It's a little choppy because it's prototype.

173
00:09:19,235 --> 00:09:21,395
But when you get it into Engine, even

174
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,776
if you animated it at 60 frames per second

175
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,897
and exported at 60 frames per second, in Engine,

176
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:30,018
you're still going to get subframe interpolation.

177
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:33,159
It's going to be variable frames per second.

178
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,120
So what's happening is between frames, that weapon bone

179
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,341
that you're animating away from is trying to go back.

180
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:43,068
to the hand that it is under in the chain.

181
00:09:43,868 --> 00:09:47,089
So you end up with this wacky, wacky weirdness.

182
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,110
So one solution for that is to just do the reload

183
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:53,851
with the left hand.

184
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,252
Oh, hold on, I gotta find the,

185
00:09:59,592 --> 00:10:00,652
the mouse turned off, Tim.

186
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:02,713
I got it, I got it.

187
00:10:06,295 --> 00:10:10,999
reload it with the left hand. So this reload is ridiculous. I

188
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,642
actually like it, though, because look at soldier 76. He's

189
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:22,508
ridiculous. But it's also straightforward and basic, but

190
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:27,051
ridiculous. So I like it. He just slaps it in. I mean, that's

191
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:31,074
goofy. But he's a little goofy. It's fine. And it's straight and

192
00:10:31,094 --> 00:10:32,515
to the point. And he's straight and to the point.

193
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:40,033
Later, of course, we realized we want to do more with how we

194
00:10:40,714 --> 00:10:41,434
handle weapons.

195
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:45,376
So why not add a weapon attachment bone that's under

196
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:49,978
the root so that we don't have these issues of moving your

197
00:10:49,998 --> 00:10:53,680
hands away from the attachment point and having the weapon

198
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,781
trying to follow along.

199
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:58,402
So this is Ana's rig.

200
00:10:59,637 --> 00:11:02,719
She has the special weapon attachment bond with 2 hand

201
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:05,160
control bones that she can hold to.

202
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:07,762
And you can see, I put the outliner on there just so you

203
00:11:07,782 --> 00:11:08,442
can see it's under the root.

204
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,364
If you can see it with all that text, this wall of text

205
00:11:11,384 --> 00:11:11,924
that's on there.

206
00:11:14,345 --> 00:11:18,688
And she's using parent spaces, which I will

207
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:19,548
talk about in a second.

208
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:21,009
I just wanted to show you her reload first.

209
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,390
I told you, free flowing and organic.

210
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:29,483
So yeah, she's got a sniper rifle with the bolt on the right,

211
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,825
so she's reloading with her left,

212
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:34,166
but pulling that bolt with the right hand,

213
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:38,108
so we can do more with taking her hand away.

214
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:41,930
There was, at one point, an attempt to fire

215
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,871
her sleep dart pistol with the right hand.

216
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:47,253
I think for just aesthetic reasons,

217
00:11:47,293 --> 00:11:48,554
we ended up going back to the left hand.

218
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:56,744
So parent spaces, many, everybody,

219
00:11:56,764 --> 00:11:59,345
okay, I shouldn't say everybody, maybe not everybody.

220
00:12:00,165 --> 00:12:00,766
Certainly not Andrew.

221
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:05,228
Many of you probably have parent spaces in your rigs now.

222
00:12:05,328 --> 00:12:06,809
It saves the animators a lot of time.

223
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:08,710
You don't have to set up constraints

224
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,711
that you know you're gonna need

225
00:12:11,211 --> 00:12:12,932
every time you set up a scene with a weapon in it.

226
00:12:13,972 --> 00:12:16,994
That's another thing that Jesse's gonna talk more about

227
00:12:17,074 --> 00:12:17,534
on Thursday.

228
00:12:17,914 --> 00:12:19,695
I just wanted to steal his slide real quick.

229
00:12:21,996 --> 00:12:23,557
It's not his exact slide he's gonna use.

230
00:12:25,609 --> 00:12:27,970
But we have these parent spaces built into the rig

231
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:31,391
so that what's happening here is her right hand IK

232
00:12:31,971 --> 00:12:34,132
is following one of the weapon bones

233
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:35,993
that is parented to the weapon attachment.

234
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,054
So that right hand, the IK of that right hand

235
00:12:39,114 --> 00:12:40,295
is following that weapon bone.

236
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:42,555
So when we can manipulate the weapon

237
00:12:42,576 --> 00:12:44,356
to actually animate the weapon to do what we want to do

238
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,557
with her right hand, we'll follow it.

239
00:12:46,077 --> 00:12:47,577
And then if she has to pull her right hand away,

240
00:12:47,617 --> 00:12:51,159
we just use this tool here to switch her bone

241
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:53,360
to the IK bone back to default.

242
00:12:54,584 --> 00:12:56,746
without having to turn on and off a constraint

243
00:12:57,367 --> 00:12:59,108
and remember where our constraints were and stuff.

244
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:01,771
And then you can just move it how you need.

245
00:13:04,815 --> 00:13:06,436
Oh, this next slide might scare some people.

246
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:09,960
Myolayers.

247
00:13:15,748 --> 00:13:19,629
We all of our assets for a first person character are in one

248
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:21,270
myopile, which is fairly traditional.

249
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,711
But the traditional way to do it is to have everything on

250
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:26,352
the timeline at different points in the timeline.

251
00:13:27,032 --> 00:13:28,872
If you've worked on a shooter, you've probably done it that

252
00:13:28,912 --> 00:13:32,774
way. The way we're doing it is utilizing myolators, which in

253
00:13:32,794 --> 00:13:34,995
the past might have been pretty heavy.

254
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,275
But it works great.

255
00:13:37,415 --> 00:13:42,457
So now we can see every asset that we are going to have.

256
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,282
all there and labeled, so we can just put our base pose

257
00:13:47,762 --> 00:13:52,844
on that base layer, and then each grouping of your assets,

258
00:13:52,884 --> 00:13:55,065
your fire, your run, your jumps, and all that

259
00:13:55,225 --> 00:13:56,646
are underneath that base pose,

260
00:13:56,686 --> 00:13:58,166
so if you change that base pose,

261
00:13:58,607 --> 00:14:00,147
it's gonna cascade down through those layers.

262
00:14:00,768 --> 00:14:02,268
And you can still use override layers as well,

263
00:14:02,288 --> 00:14:03,849
you can just bring that pose onto it,

264
00:14:03,869 --> 00:14:04,989
just click of a button.

265
00:14:07,911 --> 00:14:11,932
I like the old way very much of just doing it on,

266
00:14:13,003 --> 00:14:17,224
The timeline is great, because it doesn't bog your computer down as much.

267
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:19,565
And you can still use MyLayers to add things on top.

268
00:14:20,285 --> 00:14:22,265
So, I'm not saying this way is better or worse.

269
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,766
There's a lot of pros to this.

270
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,766
There's a lot of pros to the other way, too.

271
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,886
So, whatever works for you.

272
00:14:28,406 --> 00:14:29,307
I just know that when I say,

273
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:30,387
hey, look at all these MyLayers,

274
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:32,447
some people go, whoo, all right.

275
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:33,887
Especially if you have the graph editor over.

276
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:34,428
Meh.

277
00:14:35,268 --> 00:14:35,568
Yeah.

278
00:14:38,328 --> 00:14:41,469
And this is just a way of using the MyLayers.

279
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:42,449
So, there's one run.

280
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:44,482
for a junk rat.

281
00:14:45,603 --> 00:14:48,505
And then just a layer under there that has his detonator

282
00:14:48,565 --> 00:14:51,948
pose, and then underneath that, we can have other layers that

283
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:56,752
have his detonator animation that's separate, but playing

284
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:59,734
on top of, so in this case, the run.

285
00:15:00,655 --> 00:15:01,696
In some cases, the melee.

286
00:15:01,756 --> 00:15:04,338
So he punches, but if he has the detonator, there's just a

287
00:15:04,358 --> 00:15:06,400
layer that does that, so he can open his hand up and have

288
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:06,960
the detonator in it.

289
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:11,564
All right.

290
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:15,350
So let's talk about the process of animating the first person.

291
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:19,993
So the first thing we're going to do is find that golden pose.

292
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:23,976
And that is where everybody dogpiles onto it.

293
00:15:25,076 --> 00:15:27,998
And this is the part where you're trying to figure out,

294
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:30,540
you're working with, so the way Overwatch works.

295
00:15:31,673 --> 00:15:34,654
generally is that there's a third-person animator working

296
00:15:34,674 --> 00:15:36,814
on the third person of the character, a first-person

297
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:38,154
animator working on the first person.

298
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:41,495
We've tried it in the way where one animator will own

299
00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:44,216
the entire character, but scheduling needs means that's

300
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:45,376
not possible anymore.

301
00:15:46,556 --> 00:15:48,817
So the third person and the first-person animator will

302
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:51,197
communicate with each other, with the character designer,

303
00:15:51,297 --> 00:15:54,738
with the weapon modeler, and the character modeler.

304
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:05,553
figure out who this character is, what kind of weapon they're holding, and how it should

305
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:12,878
fit on screen. With all the ideas of making a great pose, thinking about your negative

306
00:16:12,898 --> 00:16:18,782
space, thinking about leading your eye for the gun aim towards the center of reticle.

307
00:16:23,346 --> 00:16:28,590
And of course the FOV, which I want to talk about a little bit later. There's another

308
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,430
slide I stole from Jesse.

309
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:36,596
That is Widowmaker's early prototype design for a rifle.

310
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:37,937
Oh hey, go ahead, you made it.

311
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:41,840
You can see that it wasn't really modeled

312
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,961
with first person in mind.

313
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:46,004
That you really just lose the sense of the gun.

314
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,226
And so going back and forth with.

315
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,112
the weapon modeler and finding out the correct camera FOV for this,

316
00:16:54,752 --> 00:16:58,193
we were able to arrive at something that is a little more appealing on the screen.

317
00:16:58,233 --> 00:16:59,393
It actually reads as a rifle.

318
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,834
The one on the left doesn't exactly read as a rifle.

319
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:11,557
So, finding the FOV means just finding the FOV for the player view model.

320
00:17:11,577 --> 00:17:15,579
Because we have the benefit in Overwatch, I know a lot of modern games do this now,

321
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:18,500
but we separate our world FOV.

322
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:22,277
the field of view of the world from the player view model

323
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:27,879
so that we can scale and allow a slider for players to scale,

324
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:32,261
the FOV, without futzing with our pose,

325
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:33,881
which used to drive me nuts.

326
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,142
If you've worked on a shooter before,

327
00:17:38,403 --> 00:17:41,043
you know that you're wonderfully crafted posing

328
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:45,285
can get stretched to hell when the player goes, nah,

329
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:45,965
I'm playing at 120.

330
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:50,114
which is great for them, that's fine, but my animation...

331
00:17:52,977 --> 00:17:54,039
Seriously though...

332
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:57,102
So I love this. I love that...

333
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,021
I don't have to worry about where the players FOV needs are.

334
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,301
Because there's a lot that goes into that.

335
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:05,642
Whether, because it's a cross-platform game,

336
00:18:06,242 --> 00:18:07,502
they could be playing on their couch,

337
00:18:08,282 --> 00:18:10,963
they could be playing with their face buried in a monitor,

338
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:13,304
they could get headaches at lower FOVs,

339
00:18:13,564 --> 00:18:14,824
they might just want a lower FOV

340
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,645
so they can get zoomed up on an enemy,

341
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:18,985
or a wider one so they have better peripheral awareness.

342
00:18:19,726 --> 00:18:21,586
I don't care, I got my great pose

343
00:18:21,626 --> 00:18:22,506
and it's gonna stay where it's at.

344
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:26,867
I find that FOV in the camera in Maya,

345
00:18:26,887 --> 00:18:30,449
and then I can type that into our editor to match it.

346
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,231
And I get what I want, which is beautiful.

347
00:18:37,193 --> 00:18:38,815
And it's just a handful of the poses that we have.

348
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:43,918
Junkrat, Zenyatta, Symmetra, Zarya, Winston, Soldier 76,

349
00:18:44,058 --> 00:18:48,081
Reinhardt, Mercy, and McCree.

350
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:50,522
Just an example of some other poses in game.

351
00:18:55,823 --> 00:18:58,445
Well, the time on that thing is still going.

352
00:19:00,086 --> 00:19:03,328
As I said earlier, you can cheat the hell out of your poses.

353
00:19:03,888 --> 00:19:05,789
You have a fixed camera.

354
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:07,550
Cheat the hell out of it.

355
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,692
Mercy is the first hero I ever touched on Overwatch.

356
00:19:12,673 --> 00:19:16,455
And I remember trying to get a good staff grip for her,

357
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:18,336
and I couldn't get it.

358
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:20,657
And my lead, Ryan and Jesse.

359
00:19:21,598 --> 00:19:25,419
Like, just fucking translate the fingers into place.

360
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:26,120
I was like, what?

361
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,601
Yeah, just translate the bones into place.

362
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:31,282
I didn't have experience with that before,

363
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:33,903
so I was like, you could just crank that thing out of there.

364
00:19:34,523 --> 00:19:36,104
Yeah, so her fingers are all jacked up,

365
00:19:36,144 --> 00:19:37,004
but you don't see that.

366
00:19:38,965 --> 00:19:40,505
I mean, hopefully you don't see that.

367
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,447
You'll never see that side of the staff in motion.

368
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:45,427
If she's doing her quick melee like this,

369
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:46,748
she's gonna change her grip.

370
00:19:46,848 --> 00:19:48,328
She's doing anything, she's gonna change her grip.

371
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:51,230
You'll never see that, hopefully.

372
00:19:53,502 --> 00:19:54,943
So after you find your golden pose,

373
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,085
the quickest way to get a good sense of physicality on it

374
00:19:58,185 --> 00:20:00,106
is to add additive overlays.

375
00:20:01,186 --> 00:20:03,507
Most games do this where they add an aim pose

376
00:20:03,988 --> 00:20:08,670
suite and a roll animation, or one suite that has both the roll

377
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:09,310
and the aim in it.

378
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,271
This is another slide I stole from Jesse.

379
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:11,952
Thank you.

380
00:20:11,972 --> 00:20:14,693
This is actually on his demo reel.

381
00:20:15,613 --> 00:20:17,995
So you can see that it's a spring-based.

382
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:23,846
pose the set of poses with spring value on it that we can tweak

383
00:20:24,046 --> 00:20:26,927
per hero to get the different feelings.

384
00:20:26,947 --> 00:20:28,287
Because this is what I want you to think about,

385
00:20:28,908 --> 00:20:33,049
that they're not just there to do this and to do this.

386
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:35,330
They have purpose.

387
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:38,531
And they will give you character.

388
00:20:39,832 --> 00:20:41,532
Now, this slide might hypnotize you when I play it

389
00:20:42,693 --> 00:20:43,253
or make you sick.

390
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,681
Let's talk about this.

391
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:51,323
So these are the spring-based aims and the roles.

392
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:53,885
Each hero is different, and we can author it differently

393
00:20:54,305 --> 00:20:54,745
per needs.

394
00:20:55,165 --> 00:20:58,627
McCree, who is in the top left, he's a cowboy with his

395
00:20:58,667 --> 00:20:59,108
revolver.

396
00:20:59,568 --> 00:21:00,548
He's cocky.

397
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:01,689
He's sure of himself.

398
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:03,010
He's kind of been around the block.

399
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,231
And has a smaller weapon, so he leads his

400
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:06,331
target, and it's tight.

401
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:09,753
Next to him is Zenyatta in the top, in the middle.

402
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:10,994
He's a monk who's floating.

403
00:21:11,014 --> 00:21:11,534
I told you about him.

404
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:17,072
So we can make his have this flow, but he's a robot, so it flows and snaps.

405
00:21:17,673 --> 00:21:18,433
Flows and snaps.

406
00:21:19,014 --> 00:21:26,259
So, don't just think about those basic spring aims as just something to give you the lag and lean,

407
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,521
but it actually gives you character.

408
00:21:30,162 --> 00:21:32,865
Roadhog in the middle down there, he's... he don't give a fuck.

409
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:36,848
He's got a big ol' shotgun, and he's gonna throw his hook at you and drag you into him.

410
00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:39,970
So he's super loose, and it's a shotgun.

411
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:44,812
Bastion's also a robot on the bottom left, and he's chunky.

412
00:21:45,212 --> 00:21:48,813
He's not the nice, harmonious robot like Zenyatta.

413
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:50,614
He's a chunky old war bot.

414
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:00,779
Here's another one that might make you sick.

415
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,801
So we're leveraging the same sort of system to give us

416
00:22:06,041 --> 00:22:08,942
poses for Lucio when you're wall riding.

417
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:10,363
I just wanted to show it because it's kind of neat.

418
00:22:11,323 --> 00:22:12,944
I don't really have much else to add to that.

419
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:26,810
I was gonna let this play.

420
00:22:31,188 --> 00:22:34,989
So on top of the additive lag and means that we have for aiming we have run

421
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:35,549
lanes too.

422
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:40,471
So we can add a little tilt to their runs when they're running side side or

423
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:41,031
forward and back.

424
00:22:41,951 --> 00:22:44,652
But I just wanted to show you the character

425
00:22:44,672 --> 00:22:48,132
that you get from it.

426
00:22:48,753 --> 00:22:51,693
So Winston,

427
00:22:51,713 --> 00:22:54,534
I used Winston as an example cause Gwen brought it up in a podcast.

428
00:22:56,634 --> 00:22:57,695
Winston is actually.

429
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:06,771
three-legged in a way because he's a gorilla. He uses all three limbs to run. But in first

430
00:23:06,811 --> 00:23:11,413
person, we didn't have to worry about the foot contact of that arm that's coming in.

431
00:23:11,893 --> 00:23:17,675
That arm was a pain in the butt to get right. I still don't know if it's right, but there's

432
00:23:17,775 --> 00:23:21,876
always that balance between what's going to give you good physical feeling in the camera

433
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:23,677
and what's going to make a player sick.

434
00:23:24,915 --> 00:23:26,456
So there was a lot of back and forth

435
00:23:26,577 --> 00:23:30,519
between how to get the weight and chunkiness of a gorilla

436
00:23:30,619 --> 00:23:33,301
in first person without driving a player nuts,

437
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:36,904
and then reminding them that they are a gorilla

438
00:23:36,924 --> 00:23:40,827
and they have this arm, but you aren't

439
00:23:40,867 --> 00:23:42,468
going to see it contacting the ground,

440
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:43,929
because you're looking at targets.

441
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,451
So we just wanted to give the hints of it

442
00:23:47,531 --> 00:23:51,394
without flashing in your peripheral vision.

443
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:59,388
I don't know if it's 100% successful, but I like it.

444
00:23:59,408 --> 00:24:04,130
I think it turned out okay.

445
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,491
I should've added directional runs for him too,

446
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:07,572
because he's got this way and this way.

447
00:24:07,592 --> 00:24:10,373
And it's got aims on that as well,

448
00:24:10,634 --> 00:24:12,294
on top of that another overlay animation

449
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:14,756
that if you look up, the arm leaves the screen,

450
00:24:14,796 --> 00:24:16,296
and if you look down, you get more of it.

451
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:18,097
But we never have to worry about

452
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:19,378
actually contacting the ground.

453
00:24:22,287 --> 00:24:24,808
This is the part where I just start showing you cool shit.

454
00:24:25,729 --> 00:24:26,369
Cool examples.

455
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,530
Oh, this is in Maya.

456
00:24:30,551 --> 00:24:31,972
So he's like a mile from the ground.

457
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:35,313
And you can see where I'm animating from the root

458
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:36,794
to get the camera motion.

459
00:24:36,974 --> 00:24:38,755
And then I'm adding a little bit on the camera,

460
00:24:39,715 --> 00:24:41,576
a little bit of extra translation

461
00:24:41,616 --> 00:24:46,799
that gives this feeling without rotating too far in the X.

462
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:50,581
You get that seasickness in the yaw, or the roll.

463
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:51,221
I'm sorry, the roll.

464
00:24:57,927 --> 00:25:01,108
This is Bastion, Mr. Chunky Robot.

465
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:07,530
Genji, the light-footed ninja guy.

466
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:13,372
Junkrat.

467
00:25:15,132 --> 00:25:16,833
I love Junkrat, because he's crazy.

468
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:21,354
I wanted to say something extra about Junkrat's run, just

469
00:25:21,374 --> 00:25:24,295
because the previous slide where I talked about collaboration.

470
00:25:27,017 --> 00:25:27,877
I only have five minutes left?

471
00:25:27,937 --> 00:25:28,417
Holy shit.

472
00:25:29,818 --> 00:25:30,278
We're going to go.

473
00:25:30,298 --> 00:25:30,758
We're going to go.

474
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:31,219
OK.

475
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:36,541
So Kyle Rauh, who did his weapon, we went back and forth

476
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:38,742
like, oh, you can add this bit and that bit, just to get this

477
00:25:38,802 --> 00:25:42,544
nice, chunky, kit-bashed feel out of his gun, because he is a

478
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,405
junker who just made his weapon out of

479
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:45,385
crazy bits and pieces.

480
00:25:46,206 --> 00:25:49,367
And so it's all about that conversation between him and

481
00:25:49,807 --> 00:25:51,228
concept and

482
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,387
story of like who this character is and you can bring that into the first person

483
00:25:56,407 --> 00:25:56,768
animation.

484
00:25:56,828 --> 00:25:59,613
All those little bits and pieces are hand animated to give that feeling of

485
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:04,122
uh, when I first showed this to my wife, she was like,

486
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:05,144
why the hell is he galloping?

487
00:26:06,802 --> 00:26:10,225
And my first iteration of that run in first person

488
00:26:10,385 --> 00:26:11,966
didn't have that gallop to it.

489
00:26:12,427 --> 00:26:14,588
But then I saw Kyungho's third person animation,

490
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:18,091
and he, oh yeah, he has a peg leg.

491
00:26:19,032 --> 00:26:20,313
And so we brought that in at first.

492
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,394
I think that gives it a lot of nice motion.

493
00:26:25,357 --> 00:26:26,457
Since we have five minutes,

494
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:29,340
I want to get to some other things.

495
00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:32,422
Sorry, I actually just started going off on tangents

496
00:26:32,482 --> 00:26:33,323
and I ran out of time.

497
00:26:36,322 --> 00:26:37,744
This is McCree's firing.

498
00:26:39,345 --> 00:26:41,167
It might be dropping some frames in PowerPoint,

499
00:26:41,247 --> 00:26:44,291
but you can see how much we're stretching the gun.

500
00:26:49,036 --> 00:26:51,919
So what I'm doing is that first frame that you're showing,

501
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:53,160
I usually don't export that frame.

502
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:53,961
That's the idle frame.

503
00:26:55,062 --> 00:26:57,965
The very first frame is super stretched out in space.

504
00:26:58,955 --> 00:27:02,497
forward with the gun barrel scaled up,

505
00:27:02,938 --> 00:27:04,639
and then snap back on the very next frame

506
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:06,440
just to get that feeling.

507
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,582
I hope you can feel it when he fires,

508
00:27:10,583 --> 00:27:14,166
but for me it's push it forward,

509
00:27:14,486 --> 00:27:15,707
snap it back straight back,

510
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:17,628
and then it rocks up.

511
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:19,570
So it's kind of more like this.

512
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:20,951
You see a lot of.

513
00:27:23,035 --> 00:27:26,037
I don't want to call anything out, but you see some animation that's just bang,

514
00:27:26,337 --> 00:27:27,478
like this is just kind of awkward.

515
00:27:28,219 --> 00:27:32,541
So we're snapping it really stretching and snapping it back just to give you

516
00:27:32,561 --> 00:27:36,083
that big feeling of firing. Uh, here's iron clouds,

517
00:27:36,103 --> 00:27:39,706
which I wanted to show you cause I just love how much it stretches and all the

518
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:41,907
squishy bits that was animated by Jesse.

519
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,911
Um, this is a, how we handle.

520
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:54,499
automatic firing for single firing we can do that big single fire and then a

521
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:58,602
little ones that we can ramp into with a accumulate pose.

522
00:27:58,642 --> 00:28:01,925
That's just a single pose that it sort of ramps into as you fire and then you

523
00:28:01,945 --> 00:28:03,887
let it go and it plays an added about trail

524
00:28:08,691 --> 00:28:12,414
reloads. Another slide I took from Jesse.

525
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,237
There's a lot that you're saying with reloads.

526
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:22,010
communicating to the player that they can't fire anymore. So it's okay. Don't cover the

527
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:26,311
reticle because they still want to see the threat in the way. But move the gun up. You can

528
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:34,253
actually rotate the camera in Y and move it away from the reticle just to communicate to the

529
00:28:34,273 --> 00:28:40,815
player that you're not able to fire anymore. It's pretty clear. I would avoid Frankenstein

530
00:28:40,835 --> 00:28:44,096
hands, which is just sort of...

531
00:28:49,058 --> 00:28:50,518
I'm like panicking now because I'm running out of time.

532
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:52,139
Actually, let's just skip it.

533
00:28:56,941 --> 00:28:58,782
These are just examples of reloads that I like.

534
00:29:00,043 --> 00:29:01,423
Each one, a different character.

535
00:29:02,464 --> 00:29:03,584
Reapers is ridiculous.

536
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:13,389
Michael Biancolana did both Roadhog and Zenyatta.

537
00:29:13,649 --> 00:29:14,330
I love those so much.

538
00:29:15,484 --> 00:29:17,725
The top left one, Diva, is out of New York.

539
00:29:17,765 --> 00:29:18,985
She's super cocky.

540
00:29:19,946 --> 00:29:21,407
This super cocky gamer girl.

541
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:23,628
So she's like, whatever.

542
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:26,589
So we brought that into the first person, too.

543
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:29,631
And I just think it works so nice.

544
00:29:32,072 --> 00:29:33,353
Zenyatta, Mr. Floaty Monk.

545
00:29:33,373 --> 00:29:40,016
I hope I'm giving you something interesting.

546
00:29:48,351 --> 00:29:54,433
He's just goofy. He's just a big, junky, stinky road hog. And

547
00:29:54,453 --> 00:29:58,894
he's just throwing some random crap in his shotgun. And his

548
00:29:58,934 --> 00:30:08,377
little buddy, his little buddy, the other junker, everything is

549
00:30:08,397 --> 00:30:10,017
just, who cares, get in there.

550
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:16,912
So as the first person in the third person animate or animator are working

551
00:30:16,932 --> 00:30:20,813
together, I did actually led the charge on this where it's like I did the

552
00:30:20,873 --> 00:30:22,414
animation and then I was like, Oh yeah,

553
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:23,814
I can see how I could do that in third person.

554
00:30:25,835 --> 00:30:30,976
May who's super nice and super happy to be there and she's,

555
00:30:31,096 --> 00:30:32,617
she'll fuck you up though.

556
00:30:32,637 --> 00:30:36,198
So she's like, yeah.

557
00:30:36,478 --> 00:30:41,559
Oops.

558
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:47,535
Reaper, just don't give a shit.

559
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,875
I'm sorry I ran out of time, you folks.

560
00:30:59,837 --> 00:31:00,577
Keep losing your cursor.

561
00:31:00,597 --> 00:31:01,077
I blame Tim.

562
00:31:02,998 --> 00:31:08,879
Look how much we're stretching out that arm and that leg on the contact frame.

563
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,119
That's just insanity.

564
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:13,440
It just gives you that nice snap.

565
00:31:16,265 --> 00:31:18,808
So everything that I showed you earlier about the,

566
00:31:19,569 --> 00:31:20,891
that showed the third person animation

567
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:21,752
with all the snappiness,

568
00:31:22,212 --> 00:31:23,574
it's right there in the first person.

569
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:25,436
It's all about giving you the feeling.

570
00:31:26,778 --> 00:31:28,160
The extra super stretch.

571
00:31:29,937 --> 00:31:35,579
happens on the fourth frame, you snap, we brought the weapon off

572
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,560
screen in the first frame and started bringing the hand on and

573
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,622
then really stretch it out and snap back. It's similar to the

574
00:31:43,722 --> 00:31:47,684
fire. Really stretch, snap and then a little hold. It's like

575
00:31:48,664 --> 00:31:51,385
and I hope it reads. It reads.

576
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,863
Another camera thing you can run into is translating Z gives you great sense of

577
00:31:59,923 --> 00:32:04,585
impact. That's forward and backwards in Maya. It gives you a great sense of

578
00:32:04,625 --> 00:32:09,747
impact to have that in your quick melee. Just be aware of where your player

579
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:18,751
collision is and how far out of that you can go before you're in the wall. In the

580
00:32:18,891 --> 00:32:23,273
first alpha, McCree was punching through walls. Not punching through them, his

581
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:24,174
face was going through them.

582
00:32:24,868 --> 00:32:28,108
and that was because his camera was translating too far forward

583
00:32:28,128 --> 00:32:32,889
in Z and snapping. I'm all out of time. Holy shh. Okay. Look

584
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:37,470
at that. That's awesome. That was done by Jesse. Look at all

585
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:44,052
the cheating that's going on. Look at that. Yeah. Because you

586
00:32:44,192 --> 00:32:48,232
don't care what's happening off camera. You just care what's

587
00:32:48,252 --> 00:32:52,393
happening over on the left there. Same with Genji, which

588
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:53,893
is going to play next. Yeah.

589
00:32:55,024 --> 00:32:55,904
Look how cool that is.

590
00:32:58,546 --> 00:32:59,266
Isn't that freaking rad?

591
00:32:59,286 --> 00:33:00,788
Look how far he's stretching that arm out.

592
00:33:01,768 --> 00:33:03,049
That's Jesse. Jesse kicks ass.

593
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:07,452
I know. He already told me to stop.

594
00:33:07,512 --> 00:33:09,033
And I'm like, here, take out some cool shit.

595
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:12,896
Okay, that one's not going to play.

596
00:33:14,677 --> 00:33:15,038
Oh, shh.

597
00:33:15,378 --> 00:33:16,479
Okay, PowerPoint's telling me to stop now.

598
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:17,259
It just crashed.

599
00:33:19,661 --> 00:33:21,502
So, uh...

600
00:33:23,624 --> 00:33:24,024
Thank you.

601
00:33:25,619 --> 00:33:25,779
Hold up.

602
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:25,939
Hold up.

603
00:33:25,959 --> 00:33:26,099
Hold up.

604
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:26,259
Hold up.

605
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:26,439
Hold up.

606
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:26,599
Hold up.

607
00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:26,760
Hold up.

608
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,020
Hold up.

609
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,480
Hold up.

610
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,860
Hold up.

611
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:34,723
Hold up.

612
00:33:34,743 --> 00:33:36,503
I just wanted to put this up there while I walked away.

613
00:33:37,464 --> 00:33:38,004
Thank you.

614
00:33:38,024 --> 00:33:39,925
I hope I gave you some information.

615
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:41,445
I practiced this like 100 times

616
00:33:41,905 --> 00:33:43,026
and never got fully through it,

617
00:33:43,066 --> 00:33:44,847
so now I realize why because it was too fucking long.

618
00:33:46,747 --> 00:33:47,167
You rocked it.

619
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,048
I hope it was entertaining.
