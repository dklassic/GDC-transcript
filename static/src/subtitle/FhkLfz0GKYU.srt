1
00:00:04,107 --> 00:00:12,477
Hello!

2
00:00:15,668 --> 00:00:18,550
Hello all, thank you for coming.

3
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:23,413
My name is Warren Davis, and 40 years ago this year,

4
00:00:23,413 --> 00:00:28,836
I made a little game with some help called Qbert.

5
00:00:28,836 --> 00:00:30,477
And that is what I'm here to talk about.

6
00:00:30,477 --> 00:00:34,359
It's very, especially lovely for me to be here

7
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:35,620
at the 40th anniversary.

8
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:45,824
And if you don't know that much about me, which is very likely, I'm going to go through a little bit of my career in the world of video games.

9
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:54,007
After Qubit was my first game. After Qubit, I did a Laserdisc game for the same company, Gottlieb, called Us vs. Them.

10
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:57,309
I moved to Williams, and while I was there I worked on Joust 2.

11
00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:02,771
Also did a Redemption game as a consultant called Lotto Fun.

12
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:04,972
which I'm sure you've never heard of,

13
00:01:04,972 --> 00:01:07,192
unless maybe you grew up on the Jersey Shore,

14
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,013
and then you might've.

15
00:01:09,013 --> 00:01:11,074
I worked for Premier Technology,

16
00:01:11,074 --> 00:01:14,615
which was an offshoot of Gottlieb after Gottlieb closed,

17
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:16,256
and they decided to make a video game,

18
00:01:16,256 --> 00:01:21,538
and so that turned into an arcade game called Exterminator,

19
00:01:21,538 --> 00:01:24,759
which I could probably do a whole hour on in itself.

20
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:26,440
Fans of Exterminator?

21
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,020
Hard to believe.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,362
I'm back at Williams and I worked on,

23
00:01:33,362 --> 00:01:35,824
I was on the teams that did Terminator 2

24
00:01:35,824 --> 00:01:38,666
and Revolution X featuring Aerosmith.

25
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:42,098
Don't laugh, they were really in it.

26
00:01:42,098 --> 00:01:47,860
And then the other thing that I'm sort of known for is I created the digitizing system

27
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:53,883
that allowed actors to be digitized and put into all of the Williams Valley Midway games

28
00:01:53,883 --> 00:01:55,283
of the 90s.

29
00:01:55,283 --> 00:02:01,206
And then I left the arcade industry and I worked for Disney Interactive for a while.

30
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:03,887
I was an Imagineer for four months.

31
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:05,608
I worked on the ill-fated...

32
00:02:06,128 --> 00:02:11,395
And that's putting it kindly, Spyro, Enter the Dragonfly, another, that's probably a

33
00:02:11,395 --> 00:02:14,980
more interesting story than anything.

34
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,907
I worked on an edutainment product called the Lunar Explorer, which allowed you to circle

35
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,449
and land on the moon.

36
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,590
using actual topographic data.

37
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,691
I worked for ILM for a while, actually,

38
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:30,772
here in San Francisco, although I was based in Los Angeles,

39
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:34,513
but I came up here every now and then.

40
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:37,593
And I'm currently a consultant, still a little bit working

41
00:02:37,593 --> 00:02:39,134
in the games industry.

42
00:02:39,134 --> 00:02:42,795
But we are here not to talk about that.

43
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:49,376
We're talking about Qbert, shown here in its original thing.

44
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:50,436
Wow.

45
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:50,837
That's it.

46
00:02:52,761 --> 00:02:55,462
I will speak on his behalf and say he is honored.

47
00:02:55,462 --> 00:03:01,525
So the original arcade and next to it the cocktail version, which a lot of people don't

48
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:04,146
realize there was a cocktail version.

49
00:03:04,146 --> 00:03:07,368
I don't even know how many there were.

50
00:03:07,368 --> 00:03:08,588
But let's talk a little bit about it.

51
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:12,931
The development of the game began in the spring of 1982.

52
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:14,631
So you know, 40 years ago.

53
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:24,882
It ended in the fall, the production began in October, that's when they started rolling off the production line.

54
00:03:24,882 --> 00:03:30,844
And, you know, I am told, because I really didn't know, I had no interest back in the day of things like this.

55
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:34,765
I was just amazed that the game got made at all.

56
00:03:34,765 --> 00:03:39,207
But there were about 25,000, and I'm getting that from Wikipedia, so it is suspect.

57
00:03:39,727 --> 00:03:44,148
But I have no idea how many cocktails were built.

58
00:03:44,148 --> 00:03:46,529
I do know that there are a few still floating around.

59
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:51,511
Anyway, before we get into the actual making of Cuba,

60
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:56,173
a little bit of back story about Gottlieb, which is

61
00:03:56,173 --> 00:03:58,033
the company that I work for.

62
00:03:58,033 --> 00:04:02,615
So Gottlieb, one of the original pinball manufacturers

63
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:04,195
from the early 1900s.

64
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:09,940
Gottlieb Amusement Games is what they were known as when I worked there,

65
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,223
originally known as D. Gottlieb and Company.

66
00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:17,668
It was a family-owned maker of pinball machines since 1927.

67
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,160
It was purchased by Columbia Pictures in 1976.

68
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,821
The family sold the business.

69
00:04:26,821 --> 00:04:31,362
It was also the last of the major pinball manufacturers

70
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:33,162
to get into video games.

71
00:04:33,162 --> 00:04:37,423
I'm not sure why that is, but other companies

72
00:04:37,423 --> 00:04:40,764
like Stern and Williams, they sort of

73
00:04:40,764 --> 00:04:43,165
saw that video games were a thing.

74
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:46,005
And I think Gottlieb held back and thought,

75
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:49,086
ah, video games, that fad, it's not going to last.

76
00:04:51,747 --> 00:04:56,028
But eventually they realized they had to get in the business, and so they licensed two

77
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:58,629
Japanese games in the very late 1970s.

78
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:04,571
They were called No Man's Land and New York, New York.

79
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:07,913
Has anybody ever heard of these games?

80
00:05:07,913 --> 00:05:09,313
Oh my God.

81
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:13,335
Well, you are special, and you know that.

82
00:05:13,335 --> 00:05:16,856
But so, other than Van.

83
00:05:18,745 --> 00:05:22,907
Nobody else has heard of these games, but it did get their feet wet and I think they

84
00:05:22,907 --> 00:05:26,889
started to realize, management started to realize, we've got to get into this, we've

85
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:29,170
got to get into this business.

86
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:29,931
So they decided.

87
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:33,096
to start a video department.

88
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:36,119
And they put two guys in charge.

89
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:39,182
And the two guys they put in charge were Howie Rubin,

90
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:40,623
VP of Business Development,

91
00:05:40,623 --> 00:05:42,746
and Ron Waxman, VP of Engineering.

92
00:05:42,746 --> 00:05:44,047
Here's a picture of Howie.

93
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:45,569
This was taken actually in 2018

94
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:48,932
at the Pinball Expo in Illinois.

95
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,194
Here's a picture of Ron Waxman.

96
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:54,296
Of course, it's not actually him.

97
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:56,817
But I don't have a picture of Ron.

98
00:05:56,817 --> 00:06:01,699
I have never seen a picture of Ron Waxman, just adds to his mystery.

99
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:08,801
But this picture is actually taken from a marquee in which Ron Waxman was the featured

100
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:10,322
character, but we'll talk about that.

101
00:06:10,322 --> 00:06:15,624
Anyway, upper management at Gottlieb decided, well, we don't want to start this department

102
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:18,665
in our plant at Northlake where they make all the pinball machines.

103
00:06:18,905 --> 00:06:24,506
much to the dismay of all the pinball designers who really thought they were going to get the chance, but they didn't.

104
00:06:24,506 --> 00:06:28,808
They opened it up in Bensonville, about eight miles away,

105
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:32,069
and they hired somebody who had a track record in video games.

106
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:36,910
This guy. He is Tim Skelly.

107
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,031
Tim was renowned...

108
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:45,816
Thank you. He was renowned as the designer of games like Star Castle, Rip Off, Armor Attack.

109
00:06:45,816 --> 00:06:53,182
He was the rock star guru who came and he was going to show Gottlieb how to make video games.

110
00:06:53,182 --> 00:07:00,087
He became sort of the de facto mentor to the department just because of his track record

111
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:05,371
and the fact that nobody else really had one and had never made a game. He also would later

112
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:07,973
give Qbert the nickname Noser.

113
00:07:09,354 --> 00:07:13,838
But for now, this is him sitting upon his game Reactor.

114
00:07:13,838 --> 00:07:17,281
So Reactor was the first game that Gottlieb produced

115
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:20,444
in-house, designed by Tim.

116
00:07:20,444 --> 00:07:22,626
So how do I come in the picture?

117
00:07:22,626 --> 00:07:25,288
The question is how do you get a job

118
00:07:25,288 --> 00:07:26,569
making video games in 1982?

119
00:07:26,569 --> 00:07:32,295
And the answer is you look in the newspaper in the want ads.

120
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:38,947
I'm hoping I don't have to explain to this crowd what a newspaper is.

121
00:07:38,947 --> 00:07:44,532
And I won't go into the circumstances why I was looking for a job around Christmas of

122
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:45,773
1981, but I was.

123
00:07:45,773 --> 00:07:51,098
And in the Chicago Tribune, I came upon this—this is literally the actual ad.

124
00:07:51,098 --> 00:07:53,760
I hunted it down a couple years ago.

125
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,262
Gottlieb was looking for a job.

126
00:07:56,382 --> 00:07:58,544
hardware software engineers to make video games.

127
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,125
And I couldn't believe it, honestly.

128
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,448
I always thought you had to be some kind of special person

129
00:08:03,448 --> 00:08:05,350
or you had to know people.

130
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,392
I just couldn't believe this was right in front of me.

131
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:10,694
So I actually sent in a cover letter and a resume

132
00:08:10,694 --> 00:08:13,196
and I got a response almost immediately.

133
00:08:13,196 --> 00:08:15,979
So this happened right around Christmas, 1981.

134
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,901
I think I went in for my interview on January 2nd of 1982.

135
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:21,964
And this is the building.

136
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:23,164
This was the building.

137
00:08:23,164 --> 00:08:24,945
It's a, this is of course a modern photo,

138
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:26,605
so it is no longer Gottlieb,

139
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:29,925
but it really hasn't changed very much.

140
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:32,766
I think it was more of a drab gray back then,

141
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:34,606
but essentially the same building.

142
00:08:34,606 --> 00:08:37,247
As I was walking in for my interview,

143
00:08:37,247 --> 00:08:40,307
this guy was sort of coming outside.

144
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:45,268
It was a very, like a round, large, round, rotund man

145
00:08:45,268 --> 00:08:46,828
with a very gruff voice.

146
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:48,189
And as I'm going in, he goes,

147
00:08:48,189 --> 00:08:49,389
are you here for an interview?

148
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:53,817
And I said, well, yeah, he goes, watch out for that waxman guy.

149
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:54,839
He's a real asshole.

150
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,401
So I took that with a grain of salt.

151
00:09:00,401 --> 00:09:03,583
I thought it was a little odd going in.

152
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,843
And I was shown around.

153
00:09:04,843 --> 00:09:07,844
I was shown the department by a very lovely gentleman

154
00:09:07,844 --> 00:09:10,546
named Bill Jacobs, who was a middle manager there.

155
00:09:10,546 --> 00:09:12,706
I met the crew, met the people.

156
00:09:12,706 --> 00:09:16,808
They were working on two different games at the time.

157
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:18,669
Other than Tim, who was working on Reactor,

158
00:09:18,669 --> 00:09:22,691
they were working on a pinball video hybrid called Caveman.

159
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:30,236
And they were also work that had like an Apple II based game called Quizimoto.

160
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,998
Caveman was released.

161
00:09:31,998 --> 00:09:35,320
It was basically a pinball machine with a video monitor embedded.

162
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,702
Probably the first time that happened.

163
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:42,606
Anyway, so I was hired.

164
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:43,527
Oh, actually, let me tell you that.

165
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:46,709
So when I finally got to the interview part where I had to meet Waxman.

166
00:09:48,247 --> 00:09:52,650
I go into this conference room and the guy comes in, Waxman comes in, and Waxman is the

167
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:57,073
guy who said to me out in the parking lot, look out for that Waxman guy, he's a real

168
00:09:57,073 --> 00:09:57,393
asshole.

169
00:09:57,393 --> 00:10:01,076
So I almost forgot the punchline of the story.

170
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:07,060
But that interview was really, it was really interesting because he was very, he's very

171
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:11,823
gruff, like he sits there and he just, and he smokes a cigar, always had a cigar in his

172
00:10:11,823 --> 00:10:12,023
mouth.

173
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:16,546
And he'd be saying things like, what makes you think you can design a video game?

174
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:21,238
I don't know. I've never tried it before.

175
00:10:21,238 --> 00:10:24,519
You have a computer at home? This is 1982.

176
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,960
Not a lot of people had computers at home.

177
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,941
No, I use them at work, so I didn't see a need to have one at home.

178
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:34,582
And all the questions were kind of like that.

179
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:37,523
They sort of presupposed that I had no right to be there.

180
00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:40,143
So I left that interview thinking for sure.

181
00:10:40,904 --> 00:10:42,284
I'm not getting this job.

182
00:10:42,284 --> 00:10:45,686
So much to my surprise, I was offered a job and I took it.

183
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:49,388
And it turned out Ron Waxman was not that gruff guy at all.

184
00:10:49,388 --> 00:10:50,529
It's just his persona.

185
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:52,870
And I just think he did that to mess with people.

186
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,813
But he was really a very warm hearted person

187
00:10:56,813 --> 00:10:58,574
once you got to know him.

188
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,014
Anyway, so here I am, I'm working for Gottlieb

189
00:11:00,014 --> 00:11:02,216
and we have a hardware.

190
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:03,717
They have developed hardware.

191
00:11:03,717 --> 00:11:06,538
The engineer who developed this board

192
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:08,299
was called, it was named Jun Yum.

193
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:08,359
And.

194
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:13,352
This was our major board.

195
00:11:13,352 --> 00:11:16,114
It had, well let me go through the specs of it.

196
00:11:16,114 --> 00:11:21,417
So it was based on an Intel 8088 CPU,

197
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:24,539
64 kilobytes of program memory.

198
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:25,560
Now you gotta realize,

199
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,803
we programmed everything in assembler.

200
00:11:29,803 --> 00:11:31,884
So we had to make things tight,

201
00:11:31,884 --> 00:11:33,906
but still, everything was assembler,

202
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:35,567
was pretty tight anyway.

203
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:37,548
So 64 kilobytes, pretty standard at the time.

204
00:11:38,484 --> 00:11:41,226
screen resolution of 256 by 240 pixels.

205
00:11:41,226 --> 00:11:44,930
We had 64 foreground sprites

206
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:49,735
and a sprite was 16 by 16 pixels.

207
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:54,100
The hardware took care of the display.

208
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,703
So as a programmer, it was very easy to put up,

209
00:11:56,703 --> 00:11:58,985
you know, you had sprites in your memory,

210
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,207
they were indexed, so you just...

211
00:12:00,947 --> 00:12:04,834
wrote into a foreground registry this index

212
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:07,998
at this x and this y, and the hardware just put it there.

213
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:09,260
Very easy to write code for it.

214
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,449
The background was basically eight by eight pixel blocks.

215
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:19,801
So you had 32 by 30 blocks to fill the background,

216
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:21,361
and a 16 color palette.

217
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:25,002
So you had 16 colors and each of those colors

218
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:27,583
could be one of 32,768, which is basically

219
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:32,185
five bits of red, green, and blue, 15-bit color.

220
00:12:33,646 --> 00:12:35,966
And again, I think that was pretty standard

221
00:12:35,966 --> 00:12:39,207
for the arcade industry at the time.

222
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:42,248
As far as coding, for programmers out there,

223
00:12:42,248 --> 00:12:44,049
there was no operating system really.

224
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:46,130
We had a main loop, that was it.

225
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,971
So you did everything you needed to do

226
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:51,552
that you wanted to get done in a 60th of a second,

227
00:12:51,552 --> 00:12:53,512
and then you called a V blank wait.

228
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:55,993
So you just waited for the screen to refresh.

229
00:12:55,993 --> 00:12:58,254
If you could get all of that in there.

230
00:12:58,254 --> 00:12:59,954
If you had too much going on,

231
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:02,937
the screen missed the V blank

232
00:13:02,937 --> 00:13:05,359
and you had to wait till the next frame,

233
00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:05,860
which you didn't want.

234
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,421
Anyway.

235
00:13:08,472 --> 00:13:12,815
So the same pinball soundboard was used for our video games,

236
00:13:12,815 --> 00:13:15,157
and we'll talk a little bit more about that later.

237
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:16,918
Had dip switches on the board.

238
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:19,260
The dip switch is used for things like free play,

239
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,822
on and off.

240
00:13:20,822 --> 00:13:23,103
Cocktail, remember I was talking about the cocktail table?

241
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,765
The cocktail table was interesting.

242
00:13:24,765 --> 00:13:27,267
Players sit head to head, so between turns,

243
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:30,049
the screen has to flip vertically.

244
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:31,750
So that was a dip switch setting.

245
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:36,614
The track mode had sound, but you could turn it off.

246
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:37,695
A lot of operators.

247
00:13:38,096 --> 00:13:40,821
They didn't want the attract mode making noise

248
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,686
for whatever reason, so that was a dip switch.

249
00:13:43,686 --> 00:13:47,914
And in Qbert later on, the knocker was put on a dip switch.

250
00:13:47,914 --> 00:13:47,954
So.

251
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,851
Operators can turn that off.

252
00:13:49,851 --> 00:13:54,937
But what did we use as a development system?

253
00:13:54,937 --> 00:13:56,538
Oh, wait, dip switch.

254
00:13:56,538 --> 00:13:58,540
Oh yeah, I wanted to talk about the foreground

255
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,521
and background switching.

256
00:13:59,521 --> 00:14:02,845
So there was a mechanism in the hardware

257
00:14:02,845 --> 00:14:05,027
that if you set a bit on a certain memory location,

258
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:08,891
it would flip the foreground and background.

259
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,312
Why, you ask?

260
00:14:10,312 --> 00:14:11,834
What use could this possibly be?

261
00:14:12,922 --> 00:14:15,503
We didn't know, they put it in there,

262
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:18,826
and we tried to see if we could make use of it.

263
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:20,167
And as it turned out, we did.

264
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:23,729
And then finally, what did that say?

265
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,771
Oh, upside down, yeah, upside down, that was cocktail.

266
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:27,512
That's how we did the cocktail.

267
00:14:27,512 --> 00:14:29,713
Enabled on the...

268
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:33,503
dip switch, and then programmed in software.

269
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:36,504
So, this was our development system.

270
00:14:36,504 --> 00:14:38,665
It was called an MDS-80.

271
00:14:38,665 --> 00:14:43,007
We called it the blue box, I think, for obvious reasons.

272
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,468
It was based on an in-circuit emulator,

273
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:48,450
so there was a ribbon cable that came out,

274
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,471
and the socket plugged into our board

275
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:53,252
where the processor would normally go.

276
00:14:54,092 --> 00:14:56,173
And that's what we would use.

277
00:14:56,173 --> 00:14:58,134
And we had three of those when I started.

278
00:14:58,134 --> 00:14:59,574
So we didn't have a lot of people.

279
00:14:59,574 --> 00:15:04,736
It was a small team, maybe, I want to say like 12 people,

280
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:08,218
actually, you know, hardware engineers, sound artists,

281
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:10,999
not a lot of people.

282
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:12,399
And we only had three of these to share.

283
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:20,653
at first. We did have some art tools that had been programmed and basically they were

284
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:25,656
so simple it was like a grid, like for foreground you'd have a 16 by 16 grid, you'd have a palette,

285
00:15:25,656 --> 00:15:31,941
you could pick your colors and then literally plop squares in the grid. And that's how artists

286
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:38,545
would create the art. They were called Fogus for foreground and Bogus for background.

287
00:15:39,185 --> 00:15:41,927
I did not name them.

288
00:15:41,927 --> 00:15:43,027
So what was I doing?

289
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:45,408
So basically, they said to me when I was hired,

290
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:47,229
you got to learn the system.

291
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:49,950
And we got a guy who's making a game.

292
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,190
His name was Tom Malinowski.

293
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:54,272
He was making a superhero game.

294
00:15:54,272 --> 00:15:58,414
And they asked me to help him out, sort of learn the ropes,

295
00:15:58,414 --> 00:16:00,514
get my feet wet, which I did.

296
00:16:00,514 --> 00:16:02,175
In this particular, so basically,

297
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:04,736
it's a game based on Superman.

298
00:16:05,917 --> 00:16:10,282
Superman 2, Superman battling the three Kryptonian villains.

299
00:16:10,282 --> 00:16:11,463
Of course, we didn't get the license for that

300
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:12,744
because that would cost money.

301
00:16:12,744 --> 00:16:14,907
So it was just some generic superhero.

302
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:19,792
My contribution here was that you could knock the villains

303
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:22,815
into the buildings and some rubble would spew out

304
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,737
and land on the ground.

305
00:16:24,737 --> 00:16:26,219
So I programmed the rubble.

306
00:16:26,989 --> 00:16:28,830
And then when the rubble accumulated,

307
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,570
we needed a way to get rid of it,

308
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:36,051
so I programmed the bulldozer at the bottom of the screen.

309
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:37,692
Anyway, I mean, I had to do something.

310
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:40,892
But the funny thing about this game, it was never released.

311
00:16:40,892 --> 00:16:45,373
It went through many iterations, went through many names.

312
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:47,794
For some reason, every time they changed something on it,

313
00:16:47,794 --> 00:16:49,474
they put it out on test with a different name.

314
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:52,315
So it was Protector, it was Video Man,

315
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:53,755
then it was Guardian.

316
00:16:53,755 --> 00:16:56,756
Inexplicably to me, then, the fourth one was Argus.

317
00:16:57,837 --> 00:17:00,279
And it just kept going out and not testing well.

318
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,682
And so for me, I just started calling it ProVidGuard Argus,

319
00:17:03,682 --> 00:17:05,744
and to this day, that's what I call it.

320
00:17:05,744 --> 00:17:07,545
But ironically, they released it.

321
00:17:07,545 --> 00:17:10,428
Jeff Lee, the artist, and Tom Alanowski

322
00:17:10,428 --> 00:17:12,530
found some old ROMs, and a couple years ago,

323
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,892
they actually released it.

324
00:17:14,892 --> 00:17:17,574
So you can play this game in an arcade cabinet

325
00:17:17,574 --> 00:17:19,476
at the Galloping Ghost in Illinois.

326
00:17:21,138 --> 00:17:24,602
Oh, and then the other name I forgot to mention was Waxman,

327
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:27,826
because at one point they decided to replace

328
00:17:27,826 --> 00:17:31,090
the main character with a version of Ron Waxman.

329
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:34,134
And I'm not joking, that actually happened.

330
00:17:34,134 --> 00:17:35,716
But it still did not test well.

331
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:38,778
All right, so now what?

332
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:42,022
I got my feet wet, I know the system.

333
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:44,826
Basically, management, and when I say management,

334
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:48,271
I mean Ron and Howie said to me, make a game.

335
00:17:48,271 --> 00:17:50,013
That was literally all I was told.

336
00:17:52,495 --> 00:17:55,217
All right, well, I was walking down the office one day.

337
00:17:55,217 --> 00:17:56,638
We had a big open area.

338
00:17:56,638 --> 00:17:58,499
We didn't have individual offices.

339
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:02,402
We had just work tables and a big room.

340
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:05,084
And like I said, we shared those blue boxes

341
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,385
that we only had three of.

342
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,988
And I was walking by, and this one programmer

343
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:12,830
named Kanyabamoto, who is pretty much known

344
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,112
for his game Mad Planets, if you've ever heard of that.

345
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:21,834
But Kahn was working, he was actually playing with that foreground background switching bit.

346
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:26,196
He just, he had a background image that looked like this.

347
00:18:26,196 --> 00:18:32,097
So Jeff Lee created, I think it was literally six background blocks that you could repeat

348
00:18:32,097 --> 00:18:34,318
and fill the screen to make this thing.

349
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:39,120
And I was walking by and Kahn, this of course is background, but Kahn was using it.

350
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,242
as a foreground and then removing blocks

351
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:43,643
to reveal the background,

352
00:18:43,643 --> 00:18:46,064
or reveal the foreground behind it,

353
00:18:46,064 --> 00:18:47,585
to what purpose, I don't know.

354
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,107
But I saw it and I just thought to myself,

355
00:18:50,107 --> 00:18:53,149
this is interesting because if something fell

356
00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:54,470
on a cube, on a single cube,

357
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,292
it would have one of two ways to bounce, right?

358
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:59,874
It would bounce down to the right, down to the left.

359
00:18:59,874 --> 00:19:02,636
And that's binary, zero or one.

360
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:07,758
And with seven rows of those cubes,

361
00:19:07,758 --> 00:19:10,560
which is what could fit on one of our screens,

362
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:14,963
you could put the entire path of a ball in one byte.

363
00:19:15,675 --> 00:19:18,316
So that's what occurred to me.

364
00:19:18,316 --> 00:19:24,120
So I set about taking that full screen, shaping it like this.

365
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,742
And then I went to Jeff, and I asked him for a ball,

366
00:19:26,742 --> 00:19:27,642
a bouncing ball.

367
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:30,384
So basically, all I was looking to do

368
00:19:30,384 --> 00:19:33,206
was program randomness and gravity,

369
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,647
is to learn how to do that.

370
00:19:34,647 --> 00:19:38,309
The rubble in the previous game had no gravity.

371
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:40,731
If it fell, it just fell at a linear rate,

372
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:42,632
which was very bizarre.

373
00:19:42,632 --> 00:19:42,792
But.

374
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:45,715
I didn't know how to do gravity at the time.

375
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:46,997
It was not too hard.

376
00:19:46,997 --> 00:19:49,719
But anyway, so it was just a programming exercise.

377
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:51,141
That's literally all it was.

378
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:56,607
Well, you know, once you've got that, then, you know, the question is, what do you want

379
00:19:56,607 --> 00:19:57,948
to do next?

380
00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:00,251
And it occurred to me...

381
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:04,393
Oh, I should mention also, and I'll show you this later,

382
00:20:04,393 --> 00:20:05,814
but the random number generator I used,

383
00:20:05,814 --> 00:20:08,477
I got from Tim Skelly, but we'll talk about that in a minute.

384
00:20:08,477 --> 00:20:11,679
The third thing, obviously, well, if this is working

385
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,140
and people are looking at it and they're saying,

386
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,503
this is pretty cool, the ball's bouncing down,

387
00:20:16,503 --> 00:20:18,045
maybe I should have a player character

388
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:20,186
that jumps all over the screen.

389
00:20:20,186 --> 00:20:22,008
So that was my next thing.

390
00:20:22,008 --> 00:20:24,850
So I went to Jeff, I said, do you have some art,

391
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:25,771
some character I can use?

392
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:28,533
And he put a bunch of characters up on the screen

393
00:20:28,533 --> 00:20:29,694
on his development system.

394
00:20:31,076 --> 00:20:35,563
I think they were pretty much the characters that ultimately went into Q-Bert,

395
00:20:35,563 --> 00:20:38,548
but they just were random characters at the time.

396
00:20:38,548 --> 00:20:42,695
And I saw this round one, long nose, looked kind of pathetic.

397
00:20:43,753 --> 00:20:45,834
And I thought, that's the one I want.

398
00:20:45,834 --> 00:20:49,517
So I asked him to give me all the angles I needed,

399
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:51,819
looking up, looking down, jumping, and all that stuff.

400
00:20:51,819 --> 00:20:53,180
And he gave me that.

401
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:57,143
So the next thing was, I had a player character

402
00:20:57,143 --> 00:20:58,945
jumping around the pyramid.

403
00:20:58,945 --> 00:21:01,547
Now, Jeff designed that character with a long nose

404
00:21:01,547 --> 00:21:05,630
because his intention was he would shoot stuff out

405
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:05,930
of his nose.

406
00:21:06,678 --> 00:21:08,499
But that was way too complicated.

407
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:09,779
This is my first game.

408
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:10,960
I really wasn't interested in that.

409
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,540
So I sort of nixed that idea, and I was just like,

410
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,001
let me just get the guy jumping.

411
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:16,281
So I did.

412
00:21:16,281 --> 00:21:23,883
After that, things just started happening just naturally,

413
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:24,443
I want to say.

414
00:21:24,443 --> 00:21:28,344
I've always said that the design of Q-Bert

415
00:21:28,344 --> 00:21:31,365
was evolutionary in that.

416
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:35,020
I programmed something, and then I sort of decided,

417
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,942
what do I want to program next?

418
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:39,323
Nothing was really thought about in advance.

419
00:21:39,323 --> 00:21:41,805
Everything happened one step at a time.

420
00:21:41,805 --> 00:21:43,085
So, you know, I thought, okay,

421
00:21:43,085 --> 00:21:44,646
well, the player's jumping around the pyramid,

422
00:21:44,646 --> 00:21:47,988
there are balls, he needs to collide with the balls.

423
00:21:47,988 --> 00:21:49,649
The balls need to be dangerous, you know?

424
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:55,833
And then the whole thing about having him fall off, that was a little bit of a controversial issue.

425
00:21:55,833 --> 00:22:00,937
It seemed natural to me that the player should avoid jumping off the pyramid.

426
00:22:00,937 --> 00:22:03,178
Some people said, no, it makes it too hard.

427
00:22:03,178 --> 00:22:04,799
And I sort of stuck to my guns on that.

428
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,201
But the nice thing about the jumping off the pyramid, I don't know if you've ever noticed this,

429
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,844
but what happens when he jumps off the pyramid is I use that bit and I switch the foreground

430
00:22:12,844 --> 00:22:16,606
and background so he actually falls behind the pyramid.

431
00:22:16,606 --> 00:22:19,348
And yay, that thing was of use.

432
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:25,813
Um, okay, so, it's still not a game though.

433
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:30,097
It's just, you know, it's a guy jumping around a pyramid and balls.

434
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:32,640
He's trying to avoid balls.

435
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,845
So one night, I'm working late and I'm just sort of having jumping around, just

436
00:22:36,845 --> 00:22:40,109
looking for some kind of inspiration or think of what I might want to do next.

437
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:49,016
And Waxman had this habit of sitting like in the room, in our workroom while we were working.

438
00:22:49,016 --> 00:22:52,099
And sometimes he'd like sit behind you.

439
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:56,563
And it was very unnerving because, you know, you're there, you're working, you're trying to do whatever you're trying to do.

440
00:22:56,563 --> 00:22:58,624
He's just sitting behind you smoking his cigar.

441
00:22:58,624 --> 00:23:05,971
You know, you can hear him breathing like Darth Vader or somebody.

442
00:23:05,971 --> 00:23:06,131
And.

443
00:23:07,227 --> 00:23:10,069
I'm jumping around, just sort of playing the game, and out of nowhere he just says,

444
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:14,953
uh, what if the cubes change color when he lands on them?

445
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:19,557
I thought, yeah!

446
00:23:21,325 --> 00:23:23,166
That's a great idea.

447
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,146
And I will say this about Qbert.

448
00:23:25,146 --> 00:23:26,587
It was my first game.

449
00:23:26,587 --> 00:23:30,707
I was not so arrogant as to think I had all the answers.

450
00:23:30,707 --> 00:23:33,268
I was happy to listen to anybody's suggestions.

451
00:23:33,268 --> 00:23:36,589
And believe me, people gave me a lot of suggestions

452
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:37,409
that I did not take.

453
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:39,770
But I was the one who had to implement them.

454
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,730
So if somebody gave me a suggestion

455
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,411
and it sounded right, I was like, awesome.

456
00:23:44,411 --> 00:23:48,211
So that was a great suggestion.

457
00:23:48,211 --> 00:23:48,752
I took it.

458
00:23:48,932 --> 00:23:51,873
That's when it became a game.

459
00:23:51,873 --> 00:23:56,334
And honestly, the rest of it sort of happened fairly quickly.

460
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,476
In fact, there's a story that Howie Rubin likes to tell,

461
00:23:59,476 --> 00:24:03,117
where he didn't know anything about what was going on.

462
00:24:03,117 --> 00:24:05,838
And he went to Japan for a business trip.

463
00:24:05,838 --> 00:24:08,019
He came back two weeks later, and the game

464
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:08,799
was completely done.

465
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,920
In his mind, that's what happens.

466
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,121
Like, it didn't exist, and then two weeks later,

467
00:24:13,121 --> 00:24:13,901
it was completely done.

468
00:24:14,321 --> 00:24:15,162
Not quite true.

469
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:19,985
But anyway, my goal, because it was my first game,

470
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:22,186
was to keep it simple.

471
00:24:22,186 --> 00:24:26,329
But all of these things happened pretty much in succession.

472
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:28,631
So we need a bad guy.

473
00:24:28,631 --> 00:24:31,473
We need somebody to chase him.

474
00:24:31,473 --> 00:24:34,795
He needs a way to jump off the pyramid and not die.

475
00:24:34,795 --> 00:24:38,978
Slick and Sam, these characters fall down and just

476
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,959
thwart his goal.

477
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,720
That just seemed, again, like a pretty obvious thing.

478
00:24:43,806 --> 00:24:48,108
Ugg and wrong way, okay, these guys come up with a different axis of gravity.

479
00:24:48,108 --> 00:24:51,570
This was Jeff Lee's idea, and I hated it.

480
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:57,153
And I hated it because I couldn't figure out how to do it.

481
00:24:57,153 --> 00:24:59,734
And I said, no, I can't, it's too hard.

482
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:02,636
Remember that we're in an environment where

483
00:25:04,632 --> 00:25:08,554
Speed is important, tightness of code is important,

484
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:11,817
it's all in assembler, we have no floating point arithmetic,

485
00:25:11,817 --> 00:25:14,358
it's all integer arithmetic.

486
00:25:14,358 --> 00:25:16,140
I didn't know how I was gonna do that.

487
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:19,562
And I said no, and then it just nodded me

488
00:25:19,562 --> 00:25:22,144
for like days and days and days.

489
00:25:22,144 --> 00:25:24,325
And eventually I figured it out.

490
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:26,286
I just, it like came to me and I thought,

491
00:25:26,286 --> 00:25:28,168
wait a minute, I think I can do that.

492
00:25:28,168 --> 00:25:29,589
So, Ugg and Wrongway got in the game.

493
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:33,210
And of course, the green ball is another feature.

494
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:37,571
It was an interesting dynamic of the way we worked together.

495
00:25:37,571 --> 00:25:41,792
Jeff was the only artist working on the game.

496
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:45,973
He was my constant sounding board.

497
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:48,954
He contributed so many ideas.

498
00:25:48,954 --> 00:25:51,154
I consider him a co-creator.

499
00:25:51,154 --> 00:25:53,655
It was my responsibility to make the game.

500
00:25:53,655 --> 00:25:55,335
That was just the way Gottlieb worked.

501
00:25:55,335 --> 00:25:58,556
So at Gottlieb, the programmers were considered the designers.

502
00:25:59,136 --> 00:26:00,457
because they programmed it.

503
00:26:00,457 --> 00:26:03,658
And if they didn't program something, it didn't go in.

504
00:26:03,658 --> 00:26:09,221
But Jeff was incredibly valuable and had fantastic ideas.

505
00:26:09,221 --> 00:26:10,721
And we were very simpatico.

506
00:26:10,721 --> 00:26:12,202
We sort of had the same sensibilities.

507
00:26:14,425 --> 00:26:17,106
Anyway, programming concerns.

508
00:26:17,106 --> 00:26:21,187
So there were some programming concerns going into this.

509
00:26:21,187 --> 00:26:23,748
And the first one is memory limitation.

510
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,769
I said we only had 64 kilobytes of program memory,

511
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:29,070
but this really wasn't a problem

512
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,911
because I didn't find myself bloating my code.

513
00:26:31,911 --> 00:26:34,932
I was a pretty good type programmer anyway,

514
00:26:34,932 --> 00:26:38,273
so that was something I had to be cautious about,

515
00:26:38,273 --> 00:26:40,073
but it didn't really become a problem.

516
00:26:40,534 --> 00:26:42,415
But speed, that was a problem.

517
00:26:42,415 --> 00:26:45,096
We really couldn't do, even things like square root.

518
00:26:45,096 --> 00:26:49,699
So let's talk about collision detection a little bit.

519
00:26:49,699 --> 00:26:52,721
Well, first let's talk about random number generation.

520
00:26:52,721 --> 00:26:55,523
This is a sample to talk about cycle counting,

521
00:26:55,523 --> 00:26:57,604
because that's something we used to do.

522
00:26:57,604 --> 00:27:01,047
We knew how many cycles, machine cycles,

523
00:27:01,047 --> 00:27:02,448
every instruction would take.

524
00:27:03,008 --> 00:27:05,810
And so, when we made a loop or something,

525
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:08,732
or we had any routine, we had to literally count the cycles

526
00:27:08,732 --> 00:27:11,354
to make sure it was as small and tight

527
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:12,435
as it could possibly be.

528
00:27:12,435 --> 00:27:14,557
So this is a random number generator,

529
00:27:14,557 --> 00:27:16,118
and basically what's happening is,

530
00:27:16,118 --> 00:27:18,760
you're taking a seed, actually pseudo-random,

531
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:22,342
you're taking a seed, you are doing some shifts,

532
00:27:22,342 --> 00:27:25,665
and whether you're shifting a bit around,

533
00:27:25,665 --> 00:27:27,046
but whether it's a one or a zero

534
00:27:27,046 --> 00:27:29,128
depends on what a couple of other bits are

535
00:27:29,128 --> 00:27:30,589
when you XOR them together.

536
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:33,436
I think, I don't remember.

537
00:27:33,436 --> 00:27:36,378
Anyway, but it was a really interesting thing,

538
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:38,319
and I got this from Tim Skelly.

539
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:40,560
Tim was, I can't say enough about Tim.

540
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,022
He was just the most generous guy.

541
00:27:43,022 --> 00:27:46,924
It wasn't his job to be our mentor at all.

542
00:27:46,924 --> 00:27:49,766
He was job to make a game, but he did.

543
00:27:49,766 --> 00:27:52,308
He was just very kind and generous with all of us.

544
00:27:54,837 --> 00:27:58,202
Yeah, so then the other thing, the other concern, I guess,

545
00:27:58,202 --> 00:27:59,083
collision detection.

546
00:27:59,083 --> 00:28:00,625
It's not obvious how you're going

547
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:05,691
to make these things collide, because it is a pseudo 3D space.

548
00:28:05,691 --> 00:28:08,816
But in reality, it is a 2D space.

549
00:28:08,816 --> 00:28:12,100
So you've got a ball, and you've got Qbert.

550
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,742
And they really, you know, they're just 2D sprites.

551
00:28:16,742 --> 00:28:20,764
Now, our hardware did have a sort of a Z component,

552
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:24,165
so based on which register a foreground image was in,

553
00:28:24,165 --> 00:28:27,586
it would appear on top of or behind another image.

554
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:32,888
But in order to really do the collision detection,

555
00:28:32,888 --> 00:28:35,929
right now, the simplest thing and the fastest thing

556
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:37,609
is you just do a distance check.

557
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:39,070
And you don't even do the square root.

558
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,630
You just do x squared plus y squared.

559
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,271
And you figure out r squared,

560
00:28:44,271 --> 00:28:45,911
how close they can be without colliding.

561
00:28:45,911 --> 00:28:49,172
But what I figured out to do in this case was

562
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:50,373
I had to take into account

563
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:54,195
the velocity that they were moving at, if they were moving.

564
00:28:54,195 --> 00:28:58,417
So, for example, if the ball, the ball would jump up and down.

565
00:28:58,417 --> 00:29:02,499
So based on whether it was going up, if it was going up and Q-Bert was going up, even

566
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:04,660
if they overlapped, it wasn't a collision.

567
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:10,143
So that's the kind of thing, you know, if they were coming at each other, yes, that

568
00:29:10,143 --> 00:29:11,863
would be a collision.

569
00:29:11,863 --> 00:29:13,064
You get the idea.

570
00:29:13,064 --> 00:29:15,625
So that was really a challenge to work out.

571
00:29:17,285 --> 00:29:19,647
When UG and wrong way came into the picture,

572
00:29:19,647 --> 00:29:21,629
that was even more of a challenge to make it,

573
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:24,091
you know, it's really important to make it seem fair.

574
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:26,173
You don't want these collisions to feel unfair.

575
00:29:26,173 --> 00:29:27,775
That would be extremely bad.

576
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:32,919
And I haven't looked at the code in years

577
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:35,561
to see what I did to handle the UG and wrong way problem

578
00:29:35,561 --> 00:29:37,223
because I'm afraid to.

579
00:29:38,312 --> 00:29:41,932
So, in the middle, so here we are in Bensonville,

580
00:29:41,932 --> 00:29:45,113
and by the way, Bensonville has a manufacturing plant.

581
00:29:45,113 --> 00:29:46,793
It's a massive manufacturing plant,

582
00:29:46,793 --> 00:29:48,694
which has been completely empty,

583
00:29:48,694 --> 00:29:51,955
because until they started making reactor,

584
00:29:51,955 --> 00:29:53,815
which was months after I got hired,

585
00:29:53,815 --> 00:29:56,476
there was nothing to produce.

586
00:29:56,476 --> 00:29:58,256
So we had a huge empty plant.

587
00:29:58,256 --> 00:30:00,276
In the middle of the day,

588
00:30:00,276 --> 00:30:01,937
Howie Rubin would come into the offices

589
00:30:01,937 --> 00:30:03,957
and go, everybody, stop working.

590
00:30:03,957 --> 00:30:05,638
We're going into the plant to play football.

591
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:10,499
And we had to stop working and go in the plant and pay for it.

592
00:30:10,499 --> 00:30:12,419
And we wanted to work.

593
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,199
We were not football players.

594
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:17,320
But for some reason, upper management

595
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,161
decided about halfway through the development of Qbert

596
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:23,941
that they wanted to move the video department

597
00:30:23,941 --> 00:30:27,402
into the main plant in North Lake, Illinois.

598
00:30:27,402 --> 00:30:32,003
And they kind of botched it because they didn't

599
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,825
they didn't get us together, there was no mixer,

600
00:30:34,825 --> 00:30:36,326
there were no introductions.

601
00:30:36,326 --> 00:30:40,469
Literally one day we just showed up at this new place

602
00:30:40,469 --> 00:30:43,451
and we had a beautiful big area,

603
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:45,292
we all had our own cubicles,

604
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:48,254
some people had offices around the rim

605
00:30:48,254 --> 00:30:50,036
and then we loved pinball

606
00:30:50,036 --> 00:30:52,878
and we thought the pinball guys were amazing.

607
00:30:52,878 --> 00:30:56,120
The designers, we admired them tremendously

608
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,782
but they did not admire us.

609
00:30:59,322 --> 00:31:03,384
So we came to work one day and got all these stink eye.

610
00:31:03,384 --> 00:31:05,425
It's like, why those guys?

611
00:31:05,425 --> 00:31:08,026
Why do they hate us?

612
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:11,808
Anyway, but we did move in, and we had offices

613
00:31:11,808 --> 00:31:12,769
at the main plant.

614
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:16,010
And this thing here is the only picture

615
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:18,291
that I have from those days.

616
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:20,733
And I will say this.

617
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:23,214
I don't think any of us thought what we were doing.

618
00:31:24,275 --> 00:31:25,175
meant anything.

619
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:30,018
We thought what we were making was disposable entertainment.

620
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:32,539
Six months later, it'd be off to the next game.

621
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:34,420
People would forget this game.

622
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,222
So I did not document anything I did

623
00:31:37,222 --> 00:31:39,063
because I just didn't see the importance of it.

624
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:44,506
But this is the only photograph that I have of myself

625
00:31:44,506 --> 00:31:45,447
while I was developing Kubrick.

626
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:47,348
So interesting things to say.

627
00:31:47,348 --> 00:31:50,029
Here's the blue, but you can see the blue box there

628
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:50,669
behind me.

629
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:54,915
ribbon cable, the hardware's just sitting out.

630
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:56,537
This thing is interesting here.

631
00:31:56,537 --> 00:32:00,403
This is a Tupperware bucket that is upside down.

632
00:32:01,324 --> 00:32:03,725
with a joystick mounted on it.

633
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:07,127
And I can't stress the amount of grief I got

634
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:08,088
for that joystick.

635
00:32:08,088 --> 00:32:10,609
Now, I mean, if you look at the play field,

636
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:12,610
it seems absolutely obvious to me

637
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:15,371
that you only have four possible directions to go

638
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:16,552
and they are diagonal.

639
00:32:16,552 --> 00:32:21,474
But people would walk up and straighten out that bucket

640
00:32:21,474 --> 00:32:23,035
so that it was up, down, left, right,

641
00:32:23,035 --> 00:32:25,537
and then they'd be like, I don't understand why I'm dying.

642
00:32:25,537 --> 00:32:27,097
I don't understand why it's not working.

643
00:32:27,097 --> 00:32:29,038
Well, you have to be at 45 degree angle.

644
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:29,591
What?

645
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:32,032
They could not handle it.

646
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:36,216
I got a lot of pressure to make it up, down, left, right.

647
00:32:36,216 --> 00:32:37,717
Just strangely.

648
00:32:37,717 --> 00:32:42,740
Let's see, what else is interesting in here?

649
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,661
Oh, right.

650
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:44,242
So eventually.

651
00:32:45,552 --> 00:32:51,134
Around this time, all of our development systems were replaced with an IBM PC.

652
00:32:51,134 --> 00:32:56,116
The original IBM PC, which I don't know if you are aware, the original IBM PC had no

653
00:32:56,116 --> 00:32:56,617
hard disk.

654
00:32:56,617 --> 00:32:59,518
It had a floppy disk.

655
00:32:59,518 --> 00:33:02,139
These had 8-inch floppy disks.

656
00:33:02,139 --> 00:33:08,061
The IBM PC had 5 1⁄4-inch, and they held a whopping 180K.

657
00:33:10,762 --> 00:33:13,162
and then they came out with double-sided ones

658
00:33:13,162 --> 00:33:15,703
that had 360K, and then eventually

659
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:20,905
we got our first one megabyte hard drive.

660
00:33:20,905 --> 00:33:22,826
And oh my God, we thought,

661
00:33:22,826 --> 00:33:25,387
we never need any storage again.

662
00:33:25,387 --> 00:33:26,467
One megabyte.

663
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:28,288
How are you ever gonna fill one megabyte?

664
00:33:28,288 --> 00:33:31,509
All right, you're laughing, but that's what it was.

665
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,770
Anyway, that was a picture of me.

666
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:34,950
Here's a picture of Jeff Lee.

667
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:40,095
That is Jeff Lee, although obviously it's a comic

668
00:33:40,095 --> 00:33:41,256
or cartoon version.

669
00:33:41,256 --> 00:33:44,939
This is taken from the flyer for Us Versus Them,

670
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:47,341
which is actually the second game that I did for Gottlieb.

671
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:49,563
But this is the actual Jeff Lee,

672
00:33:49,563 --> 00:33:53,686
back in the day, taken from a video.

673
00:33:53,686 --> 00:33:55,447
It's a still from a video.

674
00:33:55,447 --> 00:33:58,089
I shot some behind the scenes video,

675
00:33:58,089 --> 00:34:00,712
which I would show, except it's horribly embarrassing.

676
00:34:00,712 --> 00:34:02,813
And so I don't show it.

677
00:34:02,813 --> 00:34:03,594
But...

678
00:34:05,455 --> 00:34:08,698
When I'm gone, somebody will unearth it.

679
00:34:08,698 --> 00:34:12,761
Anyway, interesting thing here is on the thing,

680
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:15,122
Chris Brewer was one of our programmers

681
00:34:15,122 --> 00:34:18,545
and also did art as well, very talented.

682
00:34:18,545 --> 00:34:20,947
And he made a calendar, he made a Cubert calendar.

683
00:34:20,947 --> 00:34:23,909
He also made a thing called the Cubert Coloring Book,

684
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:28,172
which had different characters,

685
00:34:28,172 --> 00:34:32,155
like Jacques Cousteau with Qs, you know.

686
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:33,035
Anyway.

687
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:36,639
Let's move on.

688
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,961
So moving on, sound.

689
00:34:38,961 --> 00:34:42,322
So basically, you've met me, you've met Jeff,

690
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:44,724
but the third member of our team is the guy

691
00:34:44,724 --> 00:34:47,365
who did all of the sound and the speech,

692
00:34:47,365 --> 00:34:49,766
and that is Dave Thiel.

693
00:34:49,766 --> 00:34:51,047
Here's a picture of Dave Thiel.

694
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,469
This was taken in the late 80s at a trade show.

695
00:34:55,109 --> 00:34:58,872
And I'm sure he would kill me if he knew I was showing this.

696
00:34:58,872 --> 00:35:03,356
Now Dave was, again, not as active a member of the team,

697
00:35:03,356 --> 00:35:05,879
but indispensable.

698
00:35:05,879 --> 00:35:11,103
And because, again, I was not arrogant about the game design,

699
00:35:11,103 --> 00:35:15,627
I gave him much free reign, as I did Jeff, to be creative

700
00:35:15,627 --> 00:35:16,508
and come up with things.

701
00:35:16,508 --> 00:35:20,351
So I do remember asking him for one particular sound,

702
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,353
and that is when Kubrick jumps off the pyramid.

703
00:35:22,883 --> 00:35:24,906
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

704
00:35:24,906 --> 00:35:26,707
I did ask him for that, which he delivered,

705
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,470
but everything else was his invention.

706
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:33,014
And the thing, of course, he's most known for

707
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:36,237
is Kubert's speech.

708
00:35:36,237 --> 00:35:37,238
So how did that come about?

709
00:35:37,238 --> 00:35:41,022
Well, this is the pinball soundboard that we used.

710
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:43,905
And you see where that arrow is, that yellow arrow,

711
00:35:43,905 --> 00:35:45,687
it's pointing to a chip called the Votrax chip.

712
00:35:46,475 --> 00:35:48,860
This was a chip that produces human phonemes.

713
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:51,786
Human, like, you know, phoneme,

714
00:35:51,786 --> 00:35:54,832
everybody knows what a phoneme is, right?

715
00:35:55,437 --> 00:35:58,039
B-V, you know, and you string them together

716
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,080
and you can get speech.

717
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:04,305
Well, it's horribly monotonous and robot-like

718
00:36:04,305 --> 00:36:05,366
and does not sound good at all.

719
00:36:05,366 --> 00:36:08,769
And Dave just hated this chip and he hated using it.

720
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:10,730
He had to get things, for pinball machines,

721
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,953
he had to use it to get, say, things like bonus.

722
00:36:13,953 --> 00:36:15,935
And it just sounded like bogus all the time.

723
00:36:15,935 --> 00:36:20,859
So he hated this, but he had the genius idea

724
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,943
to throw random numbers at that chip.

725
00:36:25,742 --> 00:36:31,926
and that is Qbert's speech. It's literally random phonemes. So people say all the time,

726
00:36:31,926 --> 00:36:39,131
you know, is Qbert cursing? And I go, he might be, because you put two, you put the right two

727
00:36:39,131 --> 00:36:44,675
phonemes together and he is cursing, but it's not programmed at all. It's just random. The only

728
00:36:44,675 --> 00:36:50,019
things that Qbert says, actual English, is when you turn the power switch on, he says,

729
00:36:50,019 --> 00:36:51,660
hello, I'm turned on.

730
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:56,363
And then when you put your initials in the high score table, thank you very much,

731
00:36:56,363 --> 00:37:01,326
put your initials in the high score table, he says, bye-bye.

732
00:37:01,326 --> 00:37:09,311
So yeah, anyway, that's the story of the sounds. Now, naming him, I mean, all the way through this,

733
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:15,075
I did not give the character a name. I did not give any character's name.

734
00:37:15,075 --> 00:37:18,096
Keep in mind, I'm just trying to make a game. I don't even know what I'm doing.

735
00:37:19,557 --> 00:37:22,680
This is some code, this is code from the original game,

736
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,842
and I don't know if you can see it, maybe you can't see it,

737
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:28,405
but you will not see the name Qbert anywhere.

738
00:37:28,405 --> 00:37:30,606
You will not see anybody's names because they didn't exist.

739
00:37:30,606 --> 00:37:33,789
The player was called P-L-Y-R, player,

740
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:35,891
that's the only reference.

741
00:37:35,891 --> 00:37:40,195
The game itself is called Cubes, everything just says Cubes.

742
00:37:40,495 --> 00:37:45,599
Coily was called Chaser, C-H-S-R, in the code,

743
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,720
because I had no games.

744
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,764
Well, obviously, the game needed a name,

745
00:37:50,764 --> 00:37:52,345
and the character needed a name,

746
00:37:52,345 --> 00:37:55,188
and I think everybody, everybody agreed

747
00:37:55,188 --> 00:37:57,850
that the character name should be the name of the game.

748
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,172
That was just something, everybody just had a feeling

749
00:38:00,172 --> 00:38:00,993
that's what it should be.

750
00:38:00,993 --> 00:38:06,078
So, actually, let me go to the next slide.

751
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:09,033
So this is, I think this is from,

752
00:38:09,033 --> 00:38:10,634
and again, I don't know if you can see it or not,

753
00:38:10,634 --> 00:38:12,734
this is from Faster, Harder, More Challenging Qbert,

754
00:38:12,734 --> 00:38:15,615
and I can't even see it from here,

755
00:38:15,615 --> 00:38:18,956
but you'll see that there are references

756
00:38:18,956 --> 00:38:21,237
to Coily and Qbert in there,

757
00:38:21,237 --> 00:38:24,978
because that was after the original game.

758
00:38:26,864 --> 00:38:28,705
So Jeff was really good at naming things.

759
00:38:28,705 --> 00:38:30,146
So I let Jeff come up with names.

760
00:38:30,146 --> 00:38:33,969
So he came up with names like Ug and Wrong Way and Slick and Sam,

761
00:38:33,969 --> 00:38:37,191
which was a twist on Spick and Span.

762
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:38,332
And I was just happy.

763
00:38:38,332 --> 00:38:40,573
I was thrilled, because I did not want that burden of having

764
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:41,474
to name these characters.

765
00:38:41,474 --> 00:38:45,736
But when it came to the main character, the player character,

766
00:38:45,736 --> 00:38:47,477
it was like, what are we going to do?

767
00:38:47,477 --> 00:38:49,699
And Howie had an idea.

768
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:52,180
Howie Rubin, our head of business development,

769
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,201
had a great idea.

770
00:38:53,201 --> 00:38:55,643
He was like, let's call it the swearing balloon.

771
00:38:56,814 --> 00:38:59,737
And we were like, what?

772
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,899
He's like, yeah, let's call it that.

773
00:39:02,899 --> 00:39:05,261
Well, Howie, how are you going to pronounce that?

774
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:06,242
Well, you know what?

775
00:39:06,242 --> 00:39:08,784
If this game is as good as I think it is,

776
00:39:08,784 --> 00:39:09,905
people will find a way.

777
00:39:12,035 --> 00:39:14,637
And we were like, Howie, you're insane.

778
00:39:14,637 --> 00:39:18,280
But Howie insisted on putting the game out on test

779
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,401
with these marquees.

780
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:21,362
And then there's a handful, well,

781
00:39:21,362 --> 00:39:23,944
you might have all seen them, but back in the day,

782
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:27,527
there were, I think, like a dozen of these marquees made

783
00:39:27,527 --> 00:39:28,908
for the game to be out on test with it.

784
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:31,189
And we just thought he was nuts.

785
00:39:31,189 --> 00:39:33,971
But, you know, I think he eventually realized

786
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:35,172
the error of his ways.

787
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:36,733
It was probably not a smart idea.

788
00:39:37,867 --> 00:39:39,207
So, what are we gonna do?

789
00:39:39,207 --> 00:39:41,968
Well, I went around the office with a pad of paper,

790
00:39:41,968 --> 00:39:45,650
you know, notepad, and I polled everybody in the office.

791
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,910
Got any ideas for the name of the game?

792
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:50,011
I took everybody's suggestions.

793
00:39:50,011 --> 00:39:54,853
I had a sheet of about 50 names, and they were all terrible.

794
00:39:54,853 --> 00:39:57,694
I didn't like any of them.

795
00:39:57,694 --> 00:39:59,075
I only remember one from that.

796
00:39:59,075 --> 00:40:01,416
I wish I had that list, but I only remember one

797
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:02,376
that was Arnie Aardvark.

798
00:40:02,376 --> 00:40:02,796
Am I like, meh, no.

799
00:40:02,796 --> 00:40:02,916
Anyway.

800
00:40:08,547 --> 00:40:15,010
Howie also had an idea of calling the game Why Me?

801
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:15,890
But you know what?

802
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:17,691
We needed a name for the character.

803
00:40:17,691 --> 00:40:19,732
So we had a meeting.

804
00:40:19,732 --> 00:40:21,833
And I will never forget this meeting.

805
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:25,614
It was at least two hours, but it felt like an entire day.

806
00:40:25,614 --> 00:40:27,975
There were probably about 10 people sitting

807
00:40:27,975 --> 00:40:30,096
around the conference room.

808
00:40:30,096 --> 00:40:34,137
Middle managers was me, Jeff Lee, Ron, Howie,

809
00:40:34,137 --> 00:40:36,438
Rich Tracy was the art director for Gottlieb.

810
00:40:36,438 --> 00:40:37,359
There were some middle managers.

811
00:40:38,299 --> 00:40:42,100
all just sitting around trying to figure out what are we going to call this and it just went on and

812
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:47,742
on and we're getting nowhere and you know it's exhausting it's exhausting to be in a meeting

813
00:40:47,742 --> 00:40:54,164
where you're just feeling like this is never going to work and then you know we're all ready to give

814
00:40:54,164 --> 00:41:00,366
up and um somebody I don't remember who it was somebody walks up to the the whiteboard and writes

815
00:41:00,366 --> 00:41:07,448
Hubert and we're like Hubert what's like why what's Hubert got to do with anything it's like

816
00:41:07,448 --> 00:41:07,808
I don't know

817
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:10,348
You know, you got anything better?

818
00:41:10,348 --> 00:41:12,990
It's a cute name.

819
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:16,373
And then somebody goes, wait a minute, wait a minute.

820
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:20,056
And somebody else went up, and they erased the H,

821
00:41:20,056 --> 00:41:24,479
and they put a C. It's like, wait a minute, because cubes.

822
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:25,460
It's got cube in it.

823
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,302
Ooh, wait a minute.

824
00:41:27,302 --> 00:41:30,004
And everybody, you could feel like an energy start

825
00:41:30,004 --> 00:41:31,425
in the room, you know?

826
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:32,306
It's like electric.

827
00:41:32,306 --> 00:41:35,628
And then somebody else goes up, and they put a Q

828
00:41:35,628 --> 00:41:36,689
instead of the CU.

829
00:41:36,689 --> 00:41:37,430
And we're like.

830
00:41:38,394 --> 00:41:40,156
I mean, it's like everybody's giddy.

831
00:41:40,156 --> 00:41:42,677
It's like, you know, it's like everybody's like two years old or something.

832
00:41:42,677 --> 00:41:45,980
And then, and then I think, I think it was Jeff Lee, but it might have been Rich Trace.

833
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:50,964
It goes up and they change the dash to an asterisk and everybody just leaps out of their seats.

834
00:41:50,964 --> 00:41:54,066
And they're like, yes, yes, we found it.

835
00:41:54,066 --> 00:41:56,188
Actually, that may not have happened.

836
00:41:56,188 --> 00:41:57,329
I may be exaggerating.

837
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,911
But it felt that way, it felt that way.

838
00:41:59,911 --> 00:42:02,374
But seriously, that's how it happened.

839
00:42:02,374 --> 00:42:04,215
It was just that we were in a meeting,

840
00:42:04,215 --> 00:42:07,459
and we had that, we finally came to that name.

841
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:09,040
And literally though, it is true,

842
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,982
everybody just agreed on it.

843
00:42:10,982 --> 00:42:13,224
It was like everybody knew it was right.

844
00:42:13,224 --> 00:42:18,830
The knocker, so the knocker is a really interesting feature.

845
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,952
Sorry, I'm just curious how I'm doing on time here.

846
00:42:20,952 --> 00:42:21,673
Am I good?

847
00:42:23,678 --> 00:42:25,280
The knocker is an interesting feature.

848
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,322
People love this feature, and so do I.

849
00:42:27,322 --> 00:42:28,943
But there's a little caveat to it

850
00:42:28,943 --> 00:42:31,685
in that I know that it could have been much better

851
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:32,947
than it was, and I'll explain.

852
00:42:32,947 --> 00:42:36,850
The knocker, if you aren't aware,

853
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:39,332
it's a little device that you find in pinball machines.

854
00:42:39,332 --> 00:42:40,573
It actually just, it's a piston.

855
00:42:40,573 --> 00:42:43,536
It just knocks the wood on the side of the machine

856
00:42:43,536 --> 00:42:45,077
to make a knock sound.

857
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,763
And one of our engineering technicians came to me one day and said,

858
00:42:50,763 --> 00:42:54,645
you know, what do you think of the idea of having a knocker in the cabinet

859
00:42:54,645 --> 00:42:58,988
so when he falls off the pyramid, it's like he lands on the bottom?

860
00:42:58,988 --> 00:43:01,589
And I said, that's genius. I love that.

861
00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:03,571
So we tried it. We put it in.

862
00:43:03,571 --> 00:43:05,672
But, you know, the knock seemed wrong.

863
00:43:05,672 --> 00:43:09,174
It's like, you know, if a body lands in the bottom of a cabinet,

864
00:43:09,174 --> 00:43:10,615
it should be a thud, right?

865
00:43:10,615 --> 00:43:11,496
It shouldn't be a knock.

866
00:43:12,334 --> 00:43:18,879
So we sort of brainstormed, tried a few things, and what we came up with, we came up with a solution where if you took a little piece of foam

867
00:43:18,879 --> 00:43:24,923
where the piston hits the wood, just to soften that sound a little bit,

868
00:43:24,923 --> 00:43:29,246
it just worked perfectly. I mean, it literally sounded like a FUD,

869
00:43:29,246 --> 00:43:32,328
something like a sack of potatoes hitting the bottom of the cabinet.

870
00:43:32,689 --> 00:43:37,071
So we went to management, we told them about this, this is what we want, and they were like, well,

871
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:43,754
we could put the knocker in, but the foam, it's going to cost like an extra $15 per cabinet,

872
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:49,416
just in labor, to get somebody to go in and position it and glue it. Like, we're not going

873
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:54,238
to do that. So they put the knocker in, but I know how much better it could have been. And

874
00:43:54,238 --> 00:43:58,200
I do recommend for people to do that if you have a cupid cabinet at home.

875
00:43:59,612 --> 00:44:03,054
All right, so the game started to feel complete.

876
00:44:03,054 --> 00:44:05,035
We're getting on into the late summer of 1982,

877
00:44:05,035 --> 00:44:08,717
and all the features were in I thought needed.

878
00:44:08,717 --> 00:44:11,618
And it really was just about tuning at this point.

879
00:44:11,618 --> 00:44:14,080
And of course, I have no experience,

880
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,060
so I don't know what I'm doing.

881
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:20,343
And I've been listening to the people in the office,

882
00:44:20,343 --> 00:44:24,825
because basically there are three ways that you do testing

883
00:44:24,825 --> 00:44:25,306
and tuning.

884
00:44:25,306 --> 00:44:25,626
Here we go.

885
00:44:26,663 --> 00:44:27,044
There we go.

886
00:44:27,044 --> 00:44:29,167
So in-house testing, which basically when

887
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,570
the people you work with come by and play.

888
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,112
So that's been happening all along.

889
00:44:33,112 --> 00:44:35,536
But people have been telling me

890
00:44:35,536 --> 00:44:37,658
it's too hard from the get-go.

891
00:44:37,658 --> 00:44:38,720
So I've been slowing it down.

892
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,083
I've been trying to make it easier.

893
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:44,267
It's just so, you know, to satisfy the people in the office.

894
00:44:45,243 --> 00:44:48,968
The second thing is location testing,

895
00:44:48,968 --> 00:44:50,971
which is something in the arcade industry we would do.

896
00:44:50,971 --> 00:44:53,936
We would take the cabinets, we'd put them into the arcades.

897
00:44:53,936 --> 00:44:56,740
We usually had an agreement with a particular arcade,

898
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:57,962
and then they would collect the money,

899
00:44:57,962 --> 00:45:00,185
they'd report their coin earnings to us.

900
00:45:01,346 --> 00:45:04,827
and then they would maintain it for us.

901
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,788
Now the reason that was important was because,

902
00:45:06,788 --> 00:45:09,409
see we're a manufacturer, Gottlieb made the games.

903
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:13,350
They made their money off of selling the actual games.

904
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:16,071
They didn't make money if people put quarters in.

905
00:45:16,071 --> 00:45:19,132
But the people we sold to, distributors,

906
00:45:19,132 --> 00:45:22,533
they made their money based on people putting quarters in.

907
00:45:22,533 --> 00:45:25,434
So it behooved us to have coin data

908
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:28,075
that let them know this was gonna earn money.

909
00:45:28,815 --> 00:45:31,416
So that's pretty much how it worked.

910
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:34,598
And Qbert went out into local arcades, and it did well.

911
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:35,539
It earned money.

912
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:37,760
It was very successful in that regard.

913
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,221
But I would watch people play.

914
00:45:39,221 --> 00:45:40,282
I'd go to the arcade, and I'll never forget.

915
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:41,863
There was this little girl.

916
00:45:41,863 --> 00:45:43,064
She might have been 12.

917
00:45:43,064 --> 00:45:45,525
She came up to the Qbert cabinet.

918
00:45:45,525 --> 00:45:48,287
She put her quarter in it, and she immediately just

919
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,168
jumps right off the pyramid.

920
00:45:51,062 --> 00:45:52,202
Like, all right, give her a second.

921
00:45:52,202 --> 00:45:53,523
She might get it.

922
00:45:53,523 --> 00:45:55,905
Second life, boom, jumps right off the pyramid.

923
00:45:55,905 --> 00:45:58,547
Third life, boom, jumps right off the pyramid.

924
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:00,348
I'm like, OK, this is not good.

925
00:46:00,348 --> 00:46:02,650
And she walks away.

926
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:04,771
And then other people are coming by.

927
00:46:04,771 --> 00:46:07,413
But later, she came back, and she watched other people

928
00:46:07,413 --> 00:46:10,616
play it, and she went back to it.

929
00:46:10,616 --> 00:46:12,077
And this time, she didn't fall off the pyramid.

930
00:46:12,077 --> 00:46:14,839
So I was a little heartened by that,

931
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:16,400
but I was very, very nervous.

932
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,443
I really, you know.

933
00:46:21,515 --> 00:46:23,656
thought I had made some huge error.

934
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:28,160
Anyway, the third way that we got information

935
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,181
was focus groups.

936
00:46:29,181 --> 00:46:30,942
You know, you'd go to the mall and you'd say,

937
00:46:30,942 --> 00:46:33,144
hey, I'll give you 20 bucks if you come to this thing

938
00:46:33,144 --> 00:46:34,705
and try this video game out.

939
00:46:34,705 --> 00:46:37,948
And we were behind the one-way glass watching.

940
00:46:37,948 --> 00:46:40,230
And the thing I learned about focus groups,

941
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,152
and I've done this a number of times throughout my career,

942
00:46:43,152 --> 00:46:45,033
not only for arcade games, but for home games,

943
00:46:45,033 --> 00:46:49,597
what people say and the way they behave

944
00:46:49,597 --> 00:46:50,578
while they're playing.

945
00:46:51,217 --> 00:46:52,979
Two completely different things.

946
00:46:52,979 --> 00:46:55,723
You can see people playing and they're getting into it

947
00:46:55,723 --> 00:46:57,946
and they really look like they're enjoying it.

948
00:46:57,946 --> 00:46:59,528
And then you ask them about it after,

949
00:46:59,528 --> 00:47:00,970
and they're like, yeah, it's okay.

950
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:05,556
So I've always learned to really action,

951
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:06,457
speak louder than words.

952
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:08,801
I would recommend that.

953
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:13,779
But I have to say, I did tune it easier.

954
00:47:13,779 --> 00:47:15,962
Management sort of pressured me.

955
00:47:15,962 --> 00:47:18,364
They just felt it was too hard, it was too challenging.

956
00:47:18,364 --> 00:47:22,789
A lot of people couldn't wrap their brains around it.

957
00:47:22,789 --> 00:47:23,930
But fall of 1982, October of 1982,

958
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:27,034
Q-Bert started rolling off the production line.

959
00:47:28,795 --> 00:47:34,819
The first public real exposure to Qbert was at the trade show.

960
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:41,042
We had an industry trade show in the fall in November of 1982 called the AMOA.

961
00:47:41,042 --> 00:47:45,385
Big big trade show for the coin op industry and Gottlieb went there, brought Qbert there,

962
00:47:45,385 --> 00:47:49,507
it was a big big deal, got a lot of press.

963
00:47:49,507 --> 00:47:50,488
So this is one of the.

964
00:47:52,589 --> 00:47:56,692
trade magazines that covered the press. This is the following January, all these pictures came out,

965
00:47:56,692 --> 00:47:59,434
but here's what's interesting about this one picture I think is hysterical.

966
00:47:59,434 --> 00:48:06,219
This Gottlieb's new Qubit game is the center of attraction as from left designer Jun-Yum,

967
00:48:06,219 --> 00:48:11,103
well he was the hardware designer, wasn't the game designer, then Gottlieb president Boyd Brown,

968
00:48:11,103 --> 00:48:13,625
of course they got him right, he's the president of the company.

969
00:48:14,723 --> 00:48:17,746
and programmers Warren Davis and Howard Rubin,

970
00:48:17,746 --> 00:48:21,029
how he's not a programmer, how he's the VP of business.

971
00:48:21,029 --> 00:48:23,511
So, you know, I learned again early in my career

972
00:48:23,511 --> 00:48:26,093
that don't trust everything you read

973
00:48:26,093 --> 00:48:28,315
because they get it wrong.

974
00:48:29,176 --> 00:48:31,097
But here's something they didn't get wrong.

975
00:48:31,097 --> 00:48:34,420
People judged Q-Bert, and they made a list

976
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,222
of their picks of the show, and a lot of people

977
00:48:37,222 --> 00:48:38,503
put Q-Bert at the top of their list.

978
00:48:38,503 --> 00:48:42,245
It was really felt like it was gonna be a huge hit,

979
00:48:42,245 --> 00:48:43,246
and it was.

980
00:48:43,246 --> 00:48:44,727
I think what's most interesting about this

981
00:48:44,727 --> 00:48:47,589
is Popeye is number two.

982
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:52,573
I don't know, does anybody remember the Popeye arcade game?

983
00:48:52,573 --> 00:48:54,754
I mean, you don't hear about it that much,

984
00:48:54,754 --> 00:48:57,576
but it was also, you know.

985
00:48:57,576 --> 00:48:57,856
Anyway.

986
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:01,870
On to the next thing.

987
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:04,471
So post-release problems.

988
00:49:04,471 --> 00:49:08,073
So it wasn't too long after the game was out

989
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:10,654
that I started to get reports back,

990
00:49:10,654 --> 00:49:12,815
isolated reports, that people were playing

991
00:49:12,815 --> 00:49:14,736
for a very long time on a single quarter.

992
00:49:15,437 --> 00:49:16,918
And that's, you know, you don't want that.

993
00:49:16,918 --> 00:49:17,938
You don't want somebody to be on a machine

994
00:49:17,938 --> 00:49:19,659
because then other people aren't playing it

995
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:21,361
and they're not, thank you.

996
00:49:21,361 --> 00:49:24,243
They're not, you know, the operators of the arcades

997
00:49:24,243 --> 00:49:25,824
aren't happy, the distributors aren't happy.

998
00:49:25,824 --> 00:49:30,166
So I started to doubt that the game was tuned well

999
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:33,889
and I immediately set out to rectify that.

1000
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:34,149
So.

1001
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:41,835
And also, by the way, I should mention that there's a little secret in the tuning of the original Q-Bert.

1002
00:49:41,835 --> 00:49:45,898
If you notice, there are nine levels. There's a single-digit level.

1003
00:49:45,898 --> 00:49:51,262
Every four rounds is a new level. And it goes from one through nine, then it stays at nine.

1004
00:49:51,262 --> 00:49:55,885
The secret is, the tuning does not change after level five.

1005
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:59,710
So levels five, six, seven, eight, and nine

1006
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:03,995
are literally the exact same tuning tables.

1007
00:50:03,995 --> 00:50:06,798
Because I never imagined that anybody would get that far.

1008
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:08,359
I couldn't get that far.

1009
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:11,423
Nobody in the office could get that far.

1010
00:50:11,423 --> 00:50:12,924
That's why I was so freaked out

1011
00:50:12,924 --> 00:50:14,546
when people were getting that far.

1012
00:50:14,546 --> 00:50:16,288
So what were the problems?

1013
00:50:16,288 --> 00:50:17,169
The problems were.

1014
00:50:18,935 --> 00:50:19,576
It's too slow.

1015
00:50:19,576 --> 00:50:21,296
The very beginning, even today,

1016
00:50:21,296 --> 00:50:22,717
when I play the original Qbert,

1017
00:50:22,717 --> 00:50:24,377
I feel like he's floating from cube to cube.

1018
00:50:24,377 --> 00:50:25,698
It just feels very slow to me.

1019
00:50:25,698 --> 00:50:29,279
It's too easy.

1020
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:31,100
Again, it's just my thought.

1021
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,960
People were picking it up.

1022
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,481
And it's not challenging enough.

1023
00:50:35,481 --> 00:50:37,002
So how do you rectify that?

1024
00:50:37,002 --> 00:50:38,602
Well, it's really very simple.

1025
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:40,803
You make it faster, harder, and more challenging.

1026
00:50:40,803 --> 00:50:41,964
So that's what I set out to do.

1027
00:50:41,964 --> 00:50:44,965
And then, like, two months later,

1028
00:50:44,965 --> 00:50:47,986
I had faster, harder, more challenging Qbert.

1029
00:50:48,982 --> 00:50:53,204
So this game was different from the original Qbert.

1030
00:50:53,204 --> 00:50:55,384
I didn't want to call it Super Qbert or Qbert 2.

1031
00:50:55,384 --> 00:50:59,386
And it really wasn't a radical change.

1032
00:50:59,386 --> 00:51:03,847
It was more of a restructuring and a re-leveling.

1033
00:51:03,847 --> 00:51:05,028
Has anybody here ever played it?

1034
00:51:06,158 --> 00:51:07,939
No, oh, a few people.

1035
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:10,060
The thing is, it was never released

1036
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,461
because they put it out on test

1037
00:51:11,461 --> 00:51:12,822
right next to the original Qubert

1038
00:51:12,822 --> 00:51:14,643
when people were still learning Qubert.

1039
00:51:14,643 --> 00:51:16,765
So obviously, it did not test well.

1040
00:51:16,765 --> 00:51:18,406
My thought was they'd hold onto it

1041
00:51:18,406 --> 00:51:19,687
maybe a few months down the road,

1042
00:51:19,687 --> 00:51:21,368
they'd release it, but they did not.

1043
00:51:21,368 --> 00:51:26,211
And it stayed unreleased for many years until 1997

1044
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:28,272
when I was working at Disney

1045
00:51:28,272 --> 00:51:31,394
and I met people who were involved in the MAME project

1046
00:51:31,394 --> 00:51:34,096
and they had emulated Gottlieb's hardware

1047
00:51:34,096 --> 00:51:35,757
so I just released the ROMs to them.

1048
00:51:36,723 --> 00:51:39,705
and it's been out in the public eye since 1997.

1049
00:51:39,705 --> 00:51:43,588
Anyway, you might notice here that it says Milestar

1050
00:51:43,588 --> 00:51:50,033
instead of Gottlieb, and that's because there was a point

1051
00:51:50,033 --> 00:51:52,235
after Qbert actually was released

1052
00:51:52,235 --> 00:51:54,597
that Gottlieb decided to change their names.

1053
00:51:54,597 --> 00:51:55,978
Gottlieb was owned by Columbia.

1054
00:51:56,985 --> 00:51:59,348
Columbia was bought by Coca-Cola,

1055
00:51:59,348 --> 00:52:02,232
so we had this big corporate overlord.

1056
00:52:02,232 --> 00:52:04,415
And I remember the day they came in

1057
00:52:04,415 --> 00:52:07,098
with a big cardboard sign that was covered with a sheet.

1058
00:52:07,098 --> 00:52:09,161
It was an all-hands meeting.

1059
00:52:09,161 --> 00:52:11,624
President of the company, Boyd Brown, is so proud.

1060
00:52:11,624 --> 00:52:13,086
He comes over and he goes.

1061
00:52:13,606 --> 00:52:16,369
I want to announce the new name of our company.

1062
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:19,492
And he pulls the sheet down and there's the logo.

1063
00:52:19,492 --> 00:52:20,673
Milestar Electronics.

1064
00:52:20,673 --> 00:52:22,255
And the first thing I said out loud,

1065
00:52:22,255 --> 00:52:24,277
I don't think I knew I was saying it out loud.

1066
00:52:24,277 --> 00:52:30,644
I said, does anybody know that's rat slime spelled backwards?

1067
00:52:30,644 --> 00:52:35,108
And Boyd Brown was not amused.

1068
00:52:36,301 --> 00:52:37,621
But that's a true story.

1069
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:41,062
And because they paid some consultant like $200,000

1070
00:52:41,062 --> 00:52:42,282
to come up with some cool name.

1071
00:52:42,282 --> 00:52:45,983
It's like, didn't even think of what it spells backwards?

1072
00:52:45,983 --> 00:52:48,064
Come on.

1073
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,345
Faster, Harder, More Challenging Qbert had some things

1074
00:52:50,345 --> 00:52:53,625
like it had a bonus round where like a million Slicks and Sams

1075
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:55,806
fall and you just got to grab as many as you can.

1076
00:52:55,806 --> 00:52:58,587
The levels were completely retuned.

1077
00:52:58,587 --> 00:53:00,327
So when you jump on squares.

1078
00:53:00,828 --> 00:53:03,152
rather than every level to get harder,

1079
00:53:03,152 --> 00:53:05,096
every round it gets harder.

1080
00:53:05,096 --> 00:53:06,719
And there's a whole lot of other things like that.

1081
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:09,664
But let's talk about the aftermath of Qubit.

1082
00:53:09,664 --> 00:53:12,329
So Qubit came out, it turns out it was a success.

1083
00:53:13,028 --> 00:53:14,729
Who knew?

1084
00:53:14,729 --> 00:53:16,730
It was actually incredibly popular.

1085
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:19,732
There was an article in Video Games Magazine

1086
00:53:19,732 --> 00:53:22,213
from a guy named Neil Tesser,

1087
00:53:22,213 --> 00:53:24,854
where he covered Joust and Qbert.

1088
00:53:24,854 --> 00:53:28,276
And the interesting thing was Joust was a Williams game,

1089
00:53:28,276 --> 00:53:29,477
John Newcomer designed it,

1090
00:53:29,477 --> 00:53:31,457
Bill Futson Reuter was the programmer,

1091
00:53:31,457 --> 00:53:34,239
but they named John Newcomer, Bill Futson Reuter,

1092
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:36,840
Eugene Jarvis got named,

1093
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:39,662
but they wouldn't name us.

1094
00:53:39,902 --> 00:53:47,007
So I was D. Ziner. That was me. I had a code name because Gottlieb would not let them use my name.

1095
00:53:47,007 --> 00:53:57,436
Jeff was R. Teast. That was Jeff. Very punny, huh? And then Dave Thiel was J. Walkman.

1096
00:53:57,436 --> 00:54:00,638
So I don't know where that came from.

1097
00:54:00,972 --> 00:54:06,234
After that, we sort of pressured Gottlieb to ease up on their secrecy.

1098
00:54:06,234 --> 00:54:08,675
You know, obviously, we knew why.

1099
00:54:08,675 --> 00:54:10,596
There was a lot of poaching going on in the industry.

1100
00:54:10,596 --> 00:54:12,997
They didn't want us to be known.

1101
00:54:12,997 --> 00:54:13,897
But they relented.

1102
00:54:13,897 --> 00:54:18,539
And faster, harder, more challenging Qubit actually has a credits page.

1103
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:19,440
So we are credited.

1104
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:25,002
And I didn't credit myself as designer, even though that was technically my role,

1105
00:54:25,002 --> 00:54:27,903
because I really felt like it was a team effort.

1106
00:54:27,903 --> 00:54:29,704
All of us owned that game.

1107
00:54:30,304 --> 00:54:36,448
So, let's see, a little, just a, I'm going to very quickly run through a lot of this,

1108
00:54:36,448 --> 00:54:39,690
some of the press that Kubrick got, because it really was everywhere in 1983.

1109
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:46,695
In trade magazines, this is USA Today, that kind of blew me away, mainstream kind of stuff.

1110
00:54:46,695 --> 00:54:49,897
Of course, video game magazines is on the cover.

1111
00:54:52,010 --> 00:54:55,953
John Cougar, John Cougar mailing cam, hanging out on a QBert.

1112
00:54:55,953 --> 00:54:57,294
My God, you know?

1113
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:01,377
This is a Japanese flyer.

1114
00:55:01,377 --> 00:55:05,220
The New Yorker, the New Yorker magazine talking about QBert.

1115
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,603
And Glamour, Glamour magazine.

1116
00:55:08,603 --> 00:55:10,464
So yeah, I was like stunned.

1117
00:55:10,464 --> 00:55:13,066
Of course, I was completely anonymous.

1118
00:55:13,066 --> 00:55:15,648
You know, I didn't even know how to.

1119
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,451
handle what I was seeing.

1120
00:55:19,451 --> 00:55:21,252
But I was just very content to sort of like

1121
00:55:21,252 --> 00:55:23,993
be in the background and watch the success of the game.

1122
00:55:23,993 --> 00:55:28,056
Then there were contests where they gave away

1123
00:55:28,056 --> 00:55:28,376
Cuber cabinets.

1124
00:55:28,376 --> 00:55:31,958
This is kind of interesting because the marketing department

1125
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:35,120
really jumped on the licensing.

1126
00:55:35,888 --> 00:55:38,350
There were Qbert products everywhere.

1127
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:42,674
You can see here, yeah, I mean, I could just go on and on.

1128
00:55:42,674 --> 00:55:47,438
There was a special version that management asked us to make

1129
00:55:47,438 --> 00:55:50,320
that featured Mellow Yellow.

1130
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,442
So we actually had a Mellow Yellow can,

1131
00:55:52,442 --> 00:55:55,885
and if you remember the slide from the bonus round

1132
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:57,787
of Faster, Harder, More Challenging Qbert,

1133
00:55:57,787 --> 00:56:01,410
we basically turned that cup into a Mellow Yellow can.

1134
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:15,497
And somebody won this version. I think I heard from that person, but really interesting. Of course, there was a Saturday morning cartoon

1135
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:18,078
Anybody remember this Wow

1136
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:19,558
You can bring it down, yeah.

1137
00:56:19,558 --> 00:56:22,359
Yeah, this astonished us.

1138
00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:26,021
I think Jeff, Jeff Lee and I,

1139
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:30,503
we got a lot of what are those guys smoking comments

1140
00:56:30,503 --> 00:56:32,323
when Qbert came out.

1141
00:56:32,323 --> 00:56:33,524
But when this came out,

1142
00:56:33,524 --> 00:56:35,685
I was like what are those guys smoking?

1143
00:56:36,986 --> 00:56:39,408
But, you know, listen, it is what it is.

1144
00:56:39,408 --> 00:56:43,151
All right, I'm just gonna finish up here.

1145
00:56:43,151 --> 00:56:46,233
You know, this is where the ports came out.

1146
00:56:46,233 --> 00:56:49,015
And of course, Qbert moved on.

1147
00:56:49,015 --> 00:56:52,397
They asked me if I wanted to do a sequel

1148
00:56:52,397 --> 00:56:54,939
after Faster, Harder, More Challenging, but I didn't.

1149
00:56:54,939 --> 00:56:57,341
I wanted to move on and do other things with my life.

1150
00:56:57,341 --> 00:56:59,563
But a guy named Neil Bernstein came to me and said,

1151
00:56:59,563 --> 00:57:02,085
I've got this idea for a Qbert sequel, do you mind?

1152
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,166
And I said, no, please, have at it.

1153
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:05,887
So he made a game called Qbert's Cubes.

1154
00:57:06,642 --> 00:57:09,805
That was an arcade game that Gottlieb actually released.

1155
00:57:09,805 --> 00:57:13,910
There was a pinball game called Qbert's Quest.

1156
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:15,372
And Qbert didn't quite go away.

1157
00:57:15,372 --> 00:57:17,635
There was a little bit of a lull.

1158
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:22,901
But then Qbert 3 came out for the Super Nintendo, Game Boy.

1159
00:57:24,627 --> 00:57:26,447
again in the 90s.

1160
00:57:26,447 --> 00:57:31,149
There's another little story, ironically involving the GDC.

1161
00:57:31,149 --> 00:57:32,249
I was at a GDC here.

1162
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:34,530
I was working for Disney Interactive at the time,

1163
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:37,011
but I was at a GDC in the late 90s.

1164
00:57:37,011 --> 00:57:37,951
I think it was 97, 98.

1165
00:57:37,951 --> 00:57:42,413
And I ran into people from Sony.

1166
00:57:42,413 --> 00:57:44,614
Sony obviously, well, I shouldn't say obviously.

1167
00:57:44,614 --> 00:57:48,435
Sony, okay, so Gottlieb was bought by Columbia Pictures,

1168
00:57:48,435 --> 00:57:49,856
which was bought by Coca-Cola.

1169
00:57:49,856 --> 00:57:53,537
Coca-Cola got rid of Gottlieb and shut it down.

1170
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:56,310
Columbia Pictures was the owner.

1171
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:57,891
Columbia was bought by Sony.

1172
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:01,513
So in the 90s, Sony owned the rights to Qbert.

1173
00:58:01,513 --> 00:58:04,855
And I ran into some guys from Sony Computer Entertainment

1174
00:58:04,855 --> 00:58:06,135
of America, the games division,

1175
00:58:06,135 --> 00:58:08,617
and I said, you know, there's a lot of nostalgia

1176
00:58:08,617 --> 00:58:09,417
coming up in the 90s here.

1177
00:58:09,417 --> 00:58:12,699
There was a lot of nostalgia for old video games.

1178
00:58:12,699 --> 00:58:14,260
How come you're not doing anything with Qbert?

1179
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:15,500
Because they owned the rights.

1180
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:18,062
I never made any money off of it or anything.

1181
00:58:18,062 --> 00:58:20,203
How come you're not doing anything?

1182
00:58:20,203 --> 00:58:21,804
They said, what do you mean?

1183
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,868
And I said, well, you own the rights to Qbert.

1184
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,331
They were like, we own the rights to Qbert?

1185
00:58:27,331 --> 00:58:31,717
And they're like writing notes down,

1186
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:33,078
and they're calling people on the phone.

1187
00:58:33,078 --> 00:58:37,123
They didn't know that they owned the rights to Qbert, which

1188
00:58:37,123 --> 00:58:39,886
until recently, I thought the same thing

1189
00:58:39,886 --> 00:58:41,849
was going on in recent years.

1190
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:46,843
Anyway, a year later, Hasbro Interactive

1191
00:58:46,843 --> 00:58:50,465
came out with this version of Qubit.

1192
00:58:50,465 --> 00:58:54,628
So, and then in, oops, wait, I went backwards, sorry.

1193
00:58:54,628 --> 00:58:58,991
In more recent times, you've got this Qubit reboot,

1194
00:58:58,991 --> 00:59:01,813
it was a few years ago, and then of course,

1195
00:59:01,813 --> 00:59:04,695
you've got the movies, Wreck-It Ralph and Pixels.

1196
00:59:04,695 --> 00:59:09,538
I'm very astonished and sad that his nose has become flaccid.

1197
00:59:12,138 --> 00:59:14,394
I know he is getting old, but...

1198
00:59:15,603 --> 00:59:17,164
And I did talk a little bit about Milestar.

1199
00:59:17,164 --> 00:59:18,804
They went on, had some success,

1200
00:59:18,804 --> 00:59:22,205
but they closed their doors eventually.

1201
00:59:22,205 --> 00:59:24,065
And then this is a picture of the three of us,

1202
00:59:24,065 --> 00:59:26,846
the QBert team.

1203
00:59:26,846 --> 00:59:29,407
This was in 2016, I believe.

1204
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:32,067
The first time the three of us had gotten together,

1205
00:59:32,067 --> 00:59:33,448
and it was a surprise.

1206
00:59:33,448 --> 00:59:35,308
Jeff, I flew into Chicago,

1207
00:59:35,308 --> 00:59:37,709
and Dave Thiel was there,

1208
00:59:37,709 --> 00:59:38,809
but he didn't know I was coming,

1209
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:39,749
and Jeff drove me up,

1210
00:59:39,749 --> 00:59:41,750
and we had a little reunion.

1211
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,110
And then a couple of years later,

1212
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:44,370
we actually.

1213
00:59:44,570 --> 00:59:51,572
We were on a stage together for the first time in 30 some odd years at the Pinball Expo 2018, I think it was.

1214
00:59:51,572 --> 00:59:58,654
I just want to make very, very quickly, I've written a book, if you enjoy these stories.

1215
00:59:58,654 --> 01:00:02,255
I have many other stories that I tell about my entire arcade game career.

1216
01:00:02,255 --> 01:00:07,036
It's available wherever finer books are sold online.

1217
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:12,918
And this is a cool thing. These cabinets you're looking at are 11 inches tall.

1218
01:00:13,758 --> 01:00:16,740
New Wave Toys makes these amazing replicas of games.

1219
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:20,103
And the thing is, this one over here

1220
01:00:20,103 --> 01:00:23,725
is a perfect replica of the Cuber cabinet I have.

1221
01:00:23,725 --> 01:00:25,427
I'm told I'm out of time.

1222
01:00:25,427 --> 01:00:28,409
I'm gonna leave you with this one final image

1223
01:00:28,409 --> 01:00:29,670
to horrify your nightmares.

1224
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:32,352
Thank you, thank you so, so much for coming.

1225
01:00:32,352 --> 01:00:33,453
I had a wonderful time.

1226
01:00:33,453 --> 01:00:34,934
Thank you, everybody.
