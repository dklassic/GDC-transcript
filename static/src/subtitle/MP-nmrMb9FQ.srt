1
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:10,027
So my name is Becca Saltzman and I am the CEO of Finji.

2
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:13,229
I run a small independent development studio and publisher

3
00:00:13,229 --> 00:00:15,291
in Grand Rapids, Michigan with my husband, Adam Saltzman.

4
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:18,514
I am talking to you today, basically,

5
00:00:18,514 --> 00:00:21,696
so you're ready to pitch a publisher, you're not.

6
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:26,820
It's a nice, like, kind of mean title, but it's not

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,024
because I mentor a lot of teams.

8
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:33,766
Not only just my own teams, but also probably a lot of you

9
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:34,606
in the audience have.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,700
in the past two to three years sent us something

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,641
and we have just sort of worked,

12
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:40,581
sort of threw it with you.

13
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:43,541
And a lot of,

14
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:44,222
sort of,

15
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:49,463
themes have come out of going through these pitches.

16
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:51,103
So, I put together a talk.

17
00:00:51,103 --> 00:00:55,184
You may know me, just a little bit of background.

18
00:00:55,184 --> 00:00:56,064
Not only do I do Fingy,

19
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,584
but we are launching Overland this year.

20
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:00,065
We're gonna be publishing,

21
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:02,625
or a publisher on Wilmot's Warehouse, Tunix.

22
00:01:03,138 --> 00:01:04,699
which is Andrew Schuldice's game.

23
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,119
We launched Night in the Woods a couple years ago,

24
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,500
and it's never gonna end, just keeps coming out.

25
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,743
And long, long, long time ago, my husband made Cannibalt,

26
00:01:13,743 --> 00:01:16,064
so you're welcome for all the endless runners.

27
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:18,505
And we did my favorite game, which is Hundreds,

28
00:01:18,505 --> 00:01:20,746
which is actually my first design credit,

29
00:01:20,746 --> 00:01:22,767
even though I'm still only in the special thanks.

30
00:01:22,767 --> 00:01:25,689
We forget to update it every time we update the game.

31
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:27,469
That's what it's like to be me.

32
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:28,650
So yeah, here it is.

33
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:28,810
Hey.

34
00:01:32,658 --> 00:01:34,720
Friend, so I've been working on this thing,

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,422
and I was asked for this.

36
00:01:36,422 --> 00:01:38,944
Do you and Adam have time to?

37
00:01:38,944 --> 00:01:43,407
And the answer is usually no, but we try to make time.

38
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:46,530
So, I'm gonna go through sort of four key things,

39
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,271
these are kind of your takeaways for today.

40
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:51,474
The first of which, before you pitch,

41
00:01:51,474 --> 00:01:53,476
understand what you are making.

42
00:01:53,476 --> 00:01:56,718
And this one's always kind of fun.

43
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,421
Before you pitch, understand the audience

44
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:00,381
to who you're talking to.

45
00:02:02,645 --> 00:02:06,147
Before you pitch, understand the pitch,

46
00:02:06,147 --> 00:02:07,987
which I know is a little bit secuitous, but we'll get there.

47
00:02:07,987 --> 00:02:12,849
And then before you pitch, understand the deliverables.

48
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:16,730
Basically, what are you being asked to give?

49
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,211
And I've been really surprised at the disconnect

50
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:23,032
between the language that I use every single day

51
00:02:23,032 --> 00:02:25,173
and the language that my developers understand.

52
00:02:25,173 --> 00:02:26,514
And we'll talk a little bit about

53
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:27,574
some of those terms as we go.

54
00:02:28,487 --> 00:02:30,248
Okay, I'm gonna back up just a tiny, tiny bit

55
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:34,050
to give a little bit of context on the industry.

56
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,992
So the state of game development right now

57
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,293
often is like I'm gonna make a million dollars,

58
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:41,514
I'm gonna live my dream,

59
00:02:41,514 --> 00:02:44,175
I'm gonna drive a fancy car and have a house,

60
00:02:44,175 --> 00:02:48,578
because this one person we saw did that.

61
00:02:48,578 --> 00:02:51,699
That's not the way this works.

62
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:53,220
There's a lot of hedging your bets,

63
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,561
there's a lot of diversifying,

64
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:56,161
and there is a ton of contracting

65
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:57,662
to make sure that we are sustainable.

66
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:00,681
So the idea is from the outside looking in,

67
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,102
is like, wow, this is amazing,

68
00:03:03,102 --> 00:03:06,144
we could do our dream and make money at it,

69
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:13,329
but the reality is this industry is very, very hard.

70
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:16,651
The gold rush mentality is super dangerous.

71
00:03:16,651 --> 00:03:19,914
And a lot of people don't understand

72
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:21,515
that when a game sells 100,000 copies,

73
00:03:21,515 --> 00:03:22,215
like, you're like, oh wow, okay,

74
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:23,796
so 100,000 copies at 70%, $700,000, amazing.

75
00:03:23,796 --> 00:03:27,018
There were 12 people working on this game for five years.

76
00:03:28,268 --> 00:03:29,268
So I mean, good job.

77
00:03:29,268 --> 00:03:34,131
We've paid groceries for a few years

78
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,752
and maybe bought some toilet paper.

79
00:03:36,752 --> 00:03:40,914
But you didn't make enough to actually build something else.

80
00:03:40,914 --> 00:03:44,036
So you have to understand revenue splits.

81
00:03:44,036 --> 00:03:47,237
People cost money.

82
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:49,879
High production values, engineers and artists

83
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:53,821
and musicians and our equipment's really expensive.

84
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:56,002
And we have years in development.

85
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:57,923
God bless Overland, but that's five years.

86
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:00,650
by the time I launch it, five and a half years.

87
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,113
Night in the Woods was over three years,

88
00:04:03,113 --> 00:04:04,974
and the darn game's just not,

89
00:04:04,974 --> 00:04:06,195
I mean, we haven't launched iOS yet.

90
00:04:06,195 --> 00:04:08,517
We still have another launch on the game.

91
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:14,042
So yeah, understanding sort of like the cost involved

92
00:04:14,042 --> 00:04:15,723
going into talking to someone

93
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,444
who you want money from or help from

94
00:04:17,444 --> 00:04:22,408
is really, really important.

95
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:26,152
So Adam made this slide probably about a year ago.

96
00:04:26,718 --> 00:04:28,839
which always makes me super depressed when I look at it.

97
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,302
But it's really useful when I talk about the budgets

98
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:35,464
that I prepare for our Finji projects.

99
00:04:35,464 --> 00:04:38,006
So most games don't sell very much.

100
00:04:38,006 --> 00:04:39,887
300 to 3,000 copies.

101
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:42,069
Our budgets, when we put together,

102
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:44,150
Overland's a little bit high,

103
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,751
because we're at five years.

104
00:04:45,751 --> 00:04:48,813
That's another story, and I blame Adam.

105
00:04:48,813 --> 00:04:52,656
But most of our budgets are designed

106
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:54,037
to be about selling 30,000 copies.

107
00:04:54,037 --> 00:04:55,258
I know I can do that.

108
00:04:56,278 --> 00:04:58,619
just based on our track record and our history.

109
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:00,300
I've never sold under that.

110
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,621
So I know I can hit that number,

111
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:04,783
which means I know I can pay for my game.

112
00:05:04,783 --> 00:05:08,065
We have our hopeful sales at 300,000 copies,

113
00:05:08,065 --> 00:05:11,166
and for Finji, that's across a lot of platforms.

114
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:14,488
So I've got Steam, GOG, itch.io, Humble,

115
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,830
PlayStation, Xbox, Switch.

116
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,891
I'm counting all of them.

117
00:05:19,891 --> 00:05:23,833
And then we don't even talk about tier five.

118
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,200
Like sometimes we'll talk about half a million copies

119
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,341
when we're like drinking a little bit too much

120
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:32,222
on a Friday night or something.

121
00:05:32,222 --> 00:05:36,424
But really, when we are really talking about things,

122
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:37,485
we're more talking like 100, 150,000 copies.

123
00:05:37,485 --> 00:05:41,887
Because like I can count two hands kind of from last year

124
00:05:41,887 --> 00:05:45,568
which games did that in the indie space.

125
00:05:45,568 --> 00:05:47,369
It's a very tight market.

126
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:54,532
So this is also, this.

127
00:05:55,102 --> 00:05:57,322
It should be thought of when you're building your team,

128
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:59,203
the number of people and the length of time.

129
00:05:59,203 --> 00:06:00,984
These are your constraints.

130
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:02,845
This is the box you're drawing around your project.

131
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:04,045
And if you go outside of that box,

132
00:06:04,045 --> 00:06:08,907
you literally don't have enough money to make it.

133
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:09,187
So yeah.

134
00:06:09,187 --> 00:06:13,629
Let's go into understand what you are making.

135
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:15,330
Because those budgets matter

136
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,070
when you talk about understanding what you're making.

137
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,672
I'm gonna talk today about some prototypes.

138
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:22,913
So prototypes are not vertical slices.

139
00:06:22,913 --> 00:06:24,313
If I opened up my email right now,

140
00:06:24,522 --> 00:06:26,583
which would be really embarrassing

141
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,005
because I have about 350 unread messages in my inbox.

142
00:06:29,005 --> 00:06:31,306
I get about 20 pitches a day.

143
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:32,787
I don't publish a lot of games.

144
00:06:32,787 --> 00:06:36,269
I publish like one at a time, but I get 20 pitches a day.

145
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:37,910
And the number of prototypes that I have

146
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:40,651
coming into my inbox, one is astounding

147
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,893
and makes me realize that nobody actually knows

148
00:06:43,893 --> 00:06:46,654
how to talk to a publisher,

149
00:06:46,654 --> 00:06:51,037
but also I don't ever want to see a prototype.

150
00:06:51,037 --> 00:06:51,657
Prototypes.

151
00:06:51,952 --> 00:06:53,633
again, are not vertical slices.

152
00:06:53,633 --> 00:06:56,235
They're not system complete proof of a concept.

153
00:06:56,235 --> 00:07:00,857
They are early proof of concepts.

154
00:07:00,857 --> 00:07:02,538
They're like, I have something here.

155
00:07:02,538 --> 00:07:04,319
I might be able to do something with it.

156
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,241
They are simply proof that mechanically you

157
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:09,202
are onto something.

158
00:07:09,202 --> 00:07:10,783
And someone like me, and I'm just

159
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:12,884
going to back up a little bit, I don't come

160
00:07:12,884 --> 00:07:14,525
from a background in games.

161
00:07:14,525 --> 00:07:16,186
I'm in charge of a game studio, but I

162
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:18,863
literally played games through Super Nintendo

163
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:20,844
and never played a 3D game until I was like

164
00:07:20,844 --> 00:07:21,724
in my 20s in college.

165
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:23,345
And I got made fun of for it,

166
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:24,885
and then I stopped playing it.

167
00:07:24,885 --> 00:07:27,546
So like, I don't have this

168
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:29,447
limitless knowledge of

169
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:32,788
everything that's been made for the last, you know,

170
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:35,128
38 years of my life.

171
00:07:35,128 --> 00:07:36,829
And if people come to me with a prototype,

172
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:38,930
I often can't figure out what the heck

173
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,350
is happening when a box is bouncing around a screen.

174
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,791
Adam could, and it might be

175
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:43,491
really cool.

176
00:07:44,536 --> 00:07:46,236
But I don't know what, I can't parse that.

177
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:50,377
So prototypes in general,

178
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:53,438
and I'm gonna show you some examples

179
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:54,998
of some of the Finji game prototypes.

180
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:56,078
I've got some Tunix stuff,

181
00:07:56,078 --> 00:07:58,739
Night in the Woods stuff, and Overland stuff.

182
00:07:58,739 --> 00:08:01,780
I don't know if Andrew's in here or not,

183
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,500
but we call him Dorito Fox.

184
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,221
And Andrew approached me in 2016.

185
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:07,221
We didn't know each other,

186
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:09,561
and I was barely a publisher at that point,

187
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:11,182
and he just wanted us to mentor him.

188
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:12,522
He wanted us to talk about

189
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:15,477
his game and the thing that he had.

190
00:08:15,477 --> 00:08:17,038
And at that point, he had a prototype.

191
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,780
He had this tiny little arena, little square arena,

192
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:24,922
and he had Dorito Fox, little 3D Zelda fox running around,

193
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:27,404
and all it did was sort of dodge and roll

194
00:08:27,404 --> 00:08:29,545
and swing around his sword.

195
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:32,346
There were no levels, there was nothing.

196
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:35,068
There was a combat arena.

197
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:38,069
And Tunic is not a puzzle game.

198
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:41,031
Tunic's whole gameplay sort of revolves around

199
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:42,992
really interesting combat situations.

200
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,183
Which was interesting for us at that point,

201
00:08:46,183 --> 00:08:49,325
because I mean, it was a little Zelda fox.

202
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:53,388
Like, he had a lot of nostalgia for sort of like old 80s

203
00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:54,729
and 90s games especially,

204
00:08:54,729 --> 00:08:56,010
because he's about the same age as us.

205
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,593
And it was interesting for us at that point

206
00:08:59,593 --> 00:09:02,335
to sort of see, like, oh, this is something different.

207
00:09:02,335 --> 00:09:04,817
Not interested in publishing,

208
00:09:04,817 --> 00:09:08,060
but we were interested in mentoring this, you know,

209
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,622
random kid who came up to us after a talk at GDC.

210
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,111
And I'm showing you these different prototypes

211
00:09:14,111 --> 00:09:15,692
because this is an action-adventure game.

212
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:19,415
Night in the Woods, however, is an adventure game.

213
00:09:19,415 --> 00:09:20,737
It was kick-started in 2013,

214
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:22,798
and the first thing that the team did is they made,

215
00:09:22,798 --> 00:09:24,600
we call them the supplementals,

216
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,843
so there's Longest Night and Lost Constellation.

217
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:32,026
Longest Night is technically Night in the Woods' prototype

218
00:09:32,026 --> 00:09:34,508
because they had to figure out how to make

219
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:38,832
this elaborate narrative spaghetti ball of text work,

220
00:09:38,832 --> 00:09:41,694
and they made a very small 30-minute story.

221
00:09:42,377 --> 00:09:46,341
It did have polished art, however Scott would disagree.

222
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:48,202
He would love to redo all the art in this

223
00:09:48,202 --> 00:09:50,604
because the game, it was like two months old.

224
00:09:50,604 --> 00:09:53,046
It had just been kickstarted and he hates how it looks.

225
00:09:53,046 --> 00:09:54,487
But this was a prototype.

226
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:56,449
It was a proof of concept and people played it

227
00:09:56,449 --> 00:09:57,530
and they liked the gameplay.

228
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,173
And that's a totally different way that you can approach

229
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:04,756
sort of making the early, early versions of your game.

230
00:10:04,756 --> 00:10:08,579
I did not base publishing Night in the Woods off of this.

231
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:14,542
This is Overland's prototype.

232
00:10:14,542 --> 00:10:17,503
And if you see Overland now, you're like,

233
00:10:17,503 --> 00:10:20,164
how are these two games the same thing?

234
00:10:20,164 --> 00:10:21,804
And every once in a while, I show this to people,

235
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:22,804
like, man, I wanna play that version.

236
00:10:22,804 --> 00:10:25,705
I was like, agreed, it was really fun.

237
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:29,927
We could play it for like 45 minutes, super, super hard.

238
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:32,567
But it was a 2D pixel art grid.

239
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:35,328
We still have the grid in our like 3D,

240
00:10:35,328 --> 00:10:37,789
like beautiful, like rotating biomes.

241
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:40,009
The mechanics were solid.

242
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:40,930
We have the car.

243
00:10:41,397 --> 00:10:45,119
We have the people, we have gas, we have those monsters,

244
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,580
which literally stayed in until our vertical slice.

245
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,602
They were just in a 3D space for a long time.

246
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:54,523
I think that might be a baseball bat or a stick.

247
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:55,264
It's a weapon.

248
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:57,125
It's a stick-shaped thing.

249
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:03,128
And when we had these prototypes out,

250
00:11:03,128 --> 00:11:05,049
we were taking them to test players.

251
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:06,840
Were they engaged?

252
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,681
Or did they want to keep playing even though it was ugly?

253
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:12,463
But I wasn't taking this to someone like me.

254
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,924
I was taking my game to someone like you.

255
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,325
So we lived in Austin at the time,

256
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:19,887
and we would take this Overland prototype out

257
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,627
among our game developer friends,

258
00:11:21,627 --> 00:11:22,808
who would be able to look at something

259
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:26,090
that was kind of ugly,

260
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,672
and could they parse the gameplay that was there,

261
00:11:29,672 --> 00:11:30,932
and were we onto something?

262
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:40,503
So the next thing is, do publishers pay for prototypes?

263
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:42,424
No, no they don't.

264
00:11:42,424 --> 00:11:44,946
I was on the train, I was on Train Jam,

265
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:47,688
Infinite Train Jam, we were there forever,

266
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:48,949
I live there now.

267
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:52,031
But Richard Lemartian was on the train,

268
00:11:52,031 --> 00:11:53,452
and he's what, Call of Duty 3?

269
00:11:53,452 --> 00:11:54,313
I always get it mixed up,

270
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,534
because I met him when he was a professor.

271
00:11:56,534 --> 00:11:58,615
Uncharted, thank you, I always get it messed up.

272
00:11:58,615 --> 00:12:00,177
Uncharted 3, he worked with Amy.

273
00:12:01,194 --> 00:12:02,515
But he was on the train and we were in the back,

274
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:04,136
and he's writing a book right now, he's on sabbatical,

275
00:12:04,136 --> 00:12:05,977
and he's writing a book that has a whole chapter

276
00:12:05,977 --> 00:12:07,539
about basically everything in this talk.

277
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:09,460
And we were just sitting there shouting,

278
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,122
and he was like, yeah, well publishers,

279
00:12:12,122 --> 00:12:16,105
when they pay for prototypes, and I'm like, hold the phone.

280
00:12:16,105 --> 00:12:17,086
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

281
00:12:17,086 --> 00:12:19,408
Publishers don't pay for prototypes.

282
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:20,729
We're working on 30,000 unit budgets.

283
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:25,092
And he's like, that's, excuse my language, that's bullshit.

284
00:12:25,092 --> 00:12:29,235
I was like, yeah, but the market's really terrifying.

285
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:35,694
And prototypes, like eight weeks, five people,

286
00:12:35,694 --> 00:12:37,995
decent, I mean let's go half decent

287
00:12:37,995 --> 00:12:39,196
at like maybe $5,000 a month.

288
00:12:39,196 --> 00:12:40,777
That's the kind of numbers we're looking at

289
00:12:40,777 --> 00:12:44,399
and you're like, that's a lot of a $30,000 budget.

290
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,361
So I imagine there is probably someone in this room

291
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:51,362
who has been paid for a prototype

292
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:54,204
and I wanna buy you a drink and talk to you

293
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:55,124
to find out how you did it.

294
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:55,405
Thank you.

295
00:12:55,405 --> 00:12:55,525
But.

296
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:02,688
When you email a publisher or a console representative

297
00:13:02,688 --> 00:13:04,748
or literally anyone, if you say,

298
00:13:04,748 --> 00:13:07,469
I want money to pay for a prototype,

299
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:11,470
they will laugh and they will sometimes maybe,

300
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,010
if your idea is interesting,

301
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:15,191
but at that point you literally don't have anything to play,

302
00:13:15,191 --> 00:13:16,651
they will just kind of delete your email

303
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:18,872
or like, sorry, we're not interested, we don't have time.

304
00:13:18,872 --> 00:13:25,034
So the second thing is it often takes several prototypes

305
00:13:25,034 --> 00:13:26,374
to even land on something that's cool.

306
00:13:26,954 --> 00:13:28,995
So imagine a publisher paying for one prototype.

307
00:13:28,995 --> 00:13:31,715
But what, do we pay for three more?

308
00:13:31,715 --> 00:13:36,716
Overland is like nine months of one game

309
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:40,537
plus like Adam's three-day game jam in the summer

310
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:42,998
plus like some other BS he pulled out of a file folder

311
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:44,118
from like multiple years ago

312
00:13:44,118 --> 00:13:45,258
and he squished them all together.

313
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,999
And that's what was the beginning of Overland's prototype.

314
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:51,440
It was actually like four or five things

315
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,740
before we actually landed on our prototype.

316
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,901
So yeah, publishers won't pay for them.

317
00:13:57,608 --> 00:14:01,790
You can ask if you're established, I guess,

318
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,651
but if you kind of don't have a track record,

319
00:14:03,651 --> 00:14:05,572
they're gonna be like, no, no, no, no, no,

320
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:07,433
that's too big of a risk.

321
00:14:07,433 --> 00:14:12,215
So in the understand what you're making,

322
00:14:12,215 --> 00:14:15,797
cool, we finally have a prototype that works.

323
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:19,599
Awesome, you're like halfway, no, I lied.

324
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:21,920
You started going up a hill instead of sitting around

325
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,680
cooking at the bottom.

326
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,942
So the next thing, once you get a prototype,

327
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:26,182
you have to make a vertical slice.

328
00:14:27,865 --> 00:14:31,789
And this is the sort of thing that publishers do want to see,

329
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:34,031
because this is a full experience.

330
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:38,055
It's taking the whole gameplay loop of why your game is cool

331
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:40,677
into a short play session.

332
00:14:40,677 --> 00:14:43,520
You can start at the beginning, go through your gameplay loop.

333
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,503
It's sticky, it's awesome, and then it ends.

334
00:14:46,503 --> 00:14:47,904
And it's polished.

335
00:14:47,904 --> 00:14:50,206
Now, there's one caveat here,

336
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:52,549
which is if you're making a systems-based game,

337
00:14:52,549 --> 00:14:53,690
and I'll talk about that in a second.

338
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,252
So prototype for Tunic.

339
00:14:58,252 --> 00:15:00,633
And you've probably, if you've seen Tunic,

340
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,075
this is the version that you're familiar with.

341
00:15:03,075 --> 00:15:06,757
I've been running this demo forever.

342
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:10,100
It's the one that played at E3 last year.

343
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,621
It starts at the beginning, the fox washes up,

344
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,863
you sort of wake up, you wave,

345
00:15:14,863 --> 00:15:15,944
because he literally does,

346
00:15:15,944 --> 00:15:17,525
you can just turn around and wave at the screen.

347
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,506
And then you go up, you find your stick,

348
00:15:19,506 --> 00:15:21,688
you run through the forest,

349
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,609
you beat up some cute baddies,

350
00:15:23,609 --> 00:15:24,510
you find your sword.

351
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,586
You do a little bit of controller stuff

352
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:27,546
where you're like equipping,

353
00:15:27,546 --> 00:15:31,087
and then we put you in with the Cherry Blossom boss.

354
00:15:31,087 --> 00:15:34,047
Technically, this is like five or six hours in,

355
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:36,488
this Cherry Blossom boss.

356
00:15:36,488 --> 00:15:39,288
But in my demo, in my vertical slice,

357
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:40,669
I will take you there within 15 minutes

358
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:46,290
because I need to show you that you're collecting weapons,

359
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,491
you're equipping them, you're on an adventure,

360
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:51,991
there are save points, it is combat focused,

361
00:15:51,991 --> 00:15:53,072
and there's bad guys.

362
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,291
That's our gameplay loop.

363
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,151
The fact that the world is enormous,

364
00:15:58,151 --> 00:15:59,532
you can play it for like 14 hours,

365
00:15:59,532 --> 00:16:02,152
like all of that stuff, those are like bullet points.

366
00:16:02,152 --> 00:16:03,033
But in a vertical slice,

367
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:05,533
you want someone to play your game and be like,

368
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:08,094
holy crap, this is so cool, yes, this is awesome,

369
00:16:08,094 --> 00:16:09,514
but they don't know your budget yet.

370
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:11,775
They don't need to know any of that.

371
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,456
They need to be so damn excited about what they're playing

372
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:20,217
that their eyes glass over to the other pieces of the pitch.

373
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,271
So you need to build your vertical slice.

374
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,732
And the cool thing is, people are like,

375
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,914
oh, but what am I gonna do with it afterwards?

376
00:16:25,914 --> 00:16:27,855
I've been taking this to every PAX,

377
00:16:27,855 --> 00:16:32,999
and E3, and regional conference for literally years.

378
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:36,762
Because every single person in us, for us Indies,

379
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,405
is a new consumer, is a new player.

380
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:43,188
Our reach is so tiny that we can play the same demo,

381
00:16:43,188 --> 00:16:45,149
especially if it's good,

382
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:47,251
and especially if it has hooks, forever.

383
00:16:48,252 --> 00:16:52,074
And when you're at a show, you want to push people through as fast as possible.

384
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:53,335
Why is it cool?

385
00:16:53,335 --> 00:16:55,277
Remember the title, get out of my booth.

386
00:16:55,277 --> 00:17:00,561
I got to get somebody else in here because every person who sits down needs to buy my

387
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,602
game because I got to hit my 30,000 units.

388
00:17:02,602 --> 00:17:04,343
So I got to pay it back.

389
00:17:04,343 --> 00:17:06,405
So think about your game.

390
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:07,506
It sounds callous.

391
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:08,046
I get it.

392
00:17:08,046 --> 00:17:09,627
It really sounds callous.

393
00:17:09,627 --> 00:17:14,030
But when you look at your design, how can you get people onboarded as fast as

394
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,491
possible?

395
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:17,433
Because when they're at home in their underwear on their couch.

396
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:21,121
playing games, who cares really?

397
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:22,101
They already bought it.

398
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:25,282
They're gonna like it, they're gonna get there.

399
00:17:25,282 --> 00:17:27,102
But you have to get them over the hump

400
00:17:27,102 --> 00:17:29,443
to even be interested in the first place.

401
00:17:29,443 --> 00:17:31,823
Show them the hook and show it early.

402
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:34,364
And that includes people like me.

403
00:17:34,364 --> 00:17:36,725
That includes consoles.

404
00:17:36,725 --> 00:17:37,685
That includes journalists.

405
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:39,285
You want them to talk about your game.

406
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:41,186
Show them what's cool, show it fast.

407
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:46,367
Night in the Woods took a slightly different tact.

408
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:49,542
So Night in the Woods vertical slice

409
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:50,883
came earlier than we expected.

410
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:54,525
We had made like, or the team, I was early in the project.

411
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:58,127
The team made Longest Night,

412
00:17:58,127 --> 00:18:01,868
and then we got asked to exhibit at E3.

413
00:18:01,868 --> 00:18:04,670
20, I don't even remember it was so long ago.

414
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,051
2015, 2014, I don't know.

415
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:11,493
But they built an entire portion of the game.

416
00:18:14,263 --> 00:18:17,944
as a way to flesh out what the city looked like.

417
00:18:17,944 --> 00:18:20,865
So in this, I had one really short,

418
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:22,765
actually it wasn't really short

419
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:24,146
because it's Scott and Alec design

420
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:27,486
so you can just wander around literally forever.

421
00:18:27,486 --> 00:18:29,987
You sort of woke up in May's room,

422
00:18:29,987 --> 00:18:33,308
left, you had a conversation with the cranky old guy

423
00:18:33,308 --> 00:18:34,968
to get off my porch type outside,

424
00:18:34,968 --> 00:18:37,268
and then you went through the town.

425
00:18:37,268 --> 00:18:39,189
You were able to explore a bit of the town.

426
00:18:39,189 --> 00:18:40,609
It's really important you're able to get up

427
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:42,750
on the power lines.

428
00:18:43,225 --> 00:18:44,846
so you could show May's movement.

429
00:18:44,846 --> 00:18:47,388
You had fan practice, and then you ate donuts.

430
00:18:47,388 --> 00:18:52,151
And then you met up with Greg on a rooftop

431
00:18:52,151 --> 00:18:54,473
because he had stolen a garden gnome,

432
00:18:54,473 --> 00:18:55,794
and then you sort of, you have a choice.

433
00:18:55,794 --> 00:18:57,995
You can either throw it off the rooftop or not.

434
00:18:57,995 --> 00:19:01,157
99% of that game is literally not

435
00:19:01,157 --> 00:19:02,458
in the final product of Night in the Woods.

436
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:09,203
Hilariously, it technically was in the console version

437
00:19:09,203 --> 00:19:12,245
because we had a bug where somebody hot-keyed into it

438
00:19:12,245 --> 00:19:12,905
on launch week.

439
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:15,449
and we couldn't figure out why it was haunted

440
00:19:15,449 --> 00:19:17,630
and why they could access that.

441
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:20,731
Good moment, we were on Train Jam 2017 when that happened.

442
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:27,414
Yeah, adventures in Indies is great.

443
00:19:27,414 --> 00:19:28,274
But this particular demo,

444
00:19:28,274 --> 00:19:30,655
I carried it around for three years.

445
00:19:30,655 --> 00:19:34,136
I showed it to literally every console on the planet

446
00:19:34,136 --> 00:19:37,738
and like everybody at E3, PAX, PlayStation Experience.

447
00:19:37,738 --> 00:19:39,418
This is what traveled with it

448
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:41,579
because it showed exactly what Night in the Woods is like.

449
00:19:41,832 --> 00:19:44,033
If you play it, the only thing that feels off

450
00:19:44,033 --> 00:19:46,194
is like the gradients in the back feel weird.

451
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:48,675
And like the text isn't quite perfect.

452
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:50,035
Like you can tell it's not perfect,

453
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:52,816
but town center, I think I even still have a screenshot

454
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:56,017
from this that's in the main marketing materials.

455
00:19:56,017 --> 00:19:57,058
Like you can't tell.

456
00:19:57,058 --> 00:20:00,559
The game is like 14 hours long,

457
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,580
but this is a very small piece

458
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,320
that we cut out very early on.

459
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,381
It was proving that this design worked.

460
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:09,842
People love, they love the demo.

461
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,023
I would have crowds.

462
00:20:11,598 --> 00:20:13,319
in my booth playing this demo,

463
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,820
where you literally only read.

464
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,480
Now, I'm going back a little bit.

465
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:15,901
This ugly thing,

466
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:21,323
this is Overland's vertical slice.

467
00:20:21,323 --> 00:20:27,727
So, we have an action adventure game with Tunic.

468
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,227
We have an adventure game,

469
00:20:29,227 --> 00:20:33,329
and now we have a very heavy systems-based strategy game.

470
00:20:33,329 --> 00:20:36,731
We don't polish art in a strategy game super early,

471
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:41,273
but we did polish the hell out of the systems.

472
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:44,563
So you can play through the entire Overland game loop

473
00:20:44,563 --> 00:20:47,606
with a pretty ugly UI, but that's really early.

474
00:20:47,606 --> 00:20:51,629
Start to finish, so you drive in, collect squad,

475
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:54,311
collect fuel, have very close encounters

476
00:20:54,311 --> 00:20:58,355
on the exact same grid base size that we have now,

477
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,336
and get out, and you'd be able to do that

478
00:21:00,336 --> 00:21:03,859
in the randomly generated world through different areas.

479
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:05,100
So we had two biomes,

480
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,902
because we didn't have the cityscape yet,

481
00:21:06,902 --> 00:21:07,902
so it started in the grasslands

482
00:21:07,902 --> 00:21:09,103
and then went into the woodlands.

483
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:12,840
That was our early prototype, and I took this to shows.

484
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,481
I had to play it on a mouse and keyboard,

485
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,403
which was not ideal, but it worked.

486
00:21:16,403 --> 00:21:18,985
People who loved strategy games were able to sit down

487
00:21:18,985 --> 00:21:23,988
and play this for 45 minutes and some,

488
00:21:23,988 --> 00:21:25,389
I had to kick them out of the booth,

489
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:30,193
which is like awesome on a systems-based game at Apex.

490
00:21:30,193 --> 00:21:31,934
Doesn't usually show particularly well.

491
00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:35,717
So we call these, sort of in the more systems-based things,

492
00:21:35,717 --> 00:21:39,600
first playable, because vertical slice implies polished art.

493
00:21:40,459 --> 00:21:43,880
When I talk about strategy, we definitely,

494
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,420
sort of like, this is a first playable.

495
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,280
It is a complete gameplay loop.

496
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,821
It goes through all the mechanics

497
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:50,901
and we can talk about them intelligently.

498
00:21:50,901 --> 00:21:53,181
And then after that, we start putting down polished art.

499
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:59,503
So, oh my goodness, we have vertical slice.

500
00:21:59,503 --> 00:22:02,403
It's amazing, we can play it, our friends can play it.

501
00:22:02,403 --> 00:22:05,184
We even maybe let some of our family play it.

502
00:22:05,184 --> 00:22:06,884
People maybe are into the genre.

503
00:22:06,884 --> 00:22:10,225
But now we gotta really talk about, like, who are we?

504
00:22:10,723 --> 00:22:11,624
Who are we talking to?

505
00:22:11,624 --> 00:22:13,426
Who are we pitching to?

506
00:22:13,426 --> 00:22:15,007
And I'm gonna back up a little bit now,

507
00:22:15,007 --> 00:22:17,609
and I'm gonna go through a couple of terms

508
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:19,330
that I'm going to use,

509
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,352
and I didn't realize that people didn't know

510
00:22:21,352 --> 00:22:22,893
what these meant.

511
00:22:22,893 --> 00:22:25,635
And if you do know, pat yourself on the back,

512
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:29,738
and don't leave me a nasty note on the reviews that say,

513
00:22:29,738 --> 00:22:30,979
I knew everything she was talking about.

514
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:32,961
A lot of people don't know this,

515
00:22:32,961 --> 00:22:34,562
and I was shocked as well.

516
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,884
So the first one is simship.

517
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:44,323
I had somebody on train think that it meant simulated ship,

518
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:46,244
which makes a lot of sense.

519
00:22:46,244 --> 00:22:49,225
I was talking to Michael Molinari earlier,

520
00:22:49,225 --> 00:22:51,066
he's like, well that makes sense,

521
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:52,566
instead of simultaneous ship.

522
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:54,567
So simultaneous ship, sim ship,

523
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:58,208
means I am shipping on PC and PlayStation on day one.

524
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:01,950
And when you're talking to a publishing partner

525
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,671
or a porting partner or any of this, these matter.

526
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:06,112
You must know what sim ship means.

527
00:23:06,603 --> 00:23:09,283
I'm shipping on iOS and Android on the same day.

528
00:23:09,283 --> 00:23:14,325
I'm shipping on, if you're ludicrously crazy,

529
00:23:14,325 --> 00:23:19,186
PC and PlayStation and Xbox and Nintendo on day one.

530
00:23:19,186 --> 00:23:24,607
When these games drop on the same day, that's sim shipping.

531
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:26,007
And if you know that, awesome.

532
00:23:26,007 --> 00:23:29,008
If you don't, it's an important term to know.

533
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:31,069
A second one I even just threw out in a sentence

534
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:33,769
without meaning to, porting partner.

535
00:23:33,769 --> 00:23:35,130
I do not make.

536
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:41,074
The ports of my game, I do not make my game work on Nintendo.

537
00:23:41,074 --> 00:23:42,794
I hire a porting partner.

538
00:23:42,794 --> 00:23:46,696
It is an external studio that costs money

539
00:23:46,696 --> 00:23:47,896
to hook those games up for me

540
00:23:47,896 --> 00:23:50,137
and sort of help me through the certification process.

541
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,338
A lot of indies will do this internally.

542
00:23:52,338 --> 00:23:55,759
But when you are talking to someone else,

543
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:59,601
knowing whether you are using a porting partner or not is important

544
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:01,422
because it has a lot of questions.

545
00:24:01,422 --> 00:24:02,822
One, financial.

546
00:24:02,822 --> 00:24:02,882
Two,

547
00:24:03,165 --> 00:24:06,447
Do you know how to do this if you're doing it internally?

548
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:08,048
Have you ever done this before?

549
00:24:08,048 --> 00:24:10,190
Which is an important question to ask yourself

550
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:14,092
before you decide to commit to it.

551
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:15,933
And the other one is platform holder.

552
00:24:15,933 --> 00:24:19,216
This is also platform holder, storefront,

553
00:24:19,216 --> 00:24:21,797
console representative, all of these things

554
00:24:21,797 --> 00:24:23,499
all refer to kind of the same person,

555
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:27,301
which is not us, somebody with money.

556
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:30,804
So platform holder is Nintendo.

557
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:31,404
Storefront.

558
00:24:31,815 --> 00:24:34,976
Steam, like they all are interchangeable.

559
00:24:34,976 --> 00:24:37,357
But these are words that we will literally throw around

560
00:24:37,357 --> 00:24:40,398
without realizing you don't know what they mean.

561
00:24:40,398 --> 00:24:42,158
And then I've been on the receiving end of this

562
00:24:42,158 --> 00:24:43,459
because I had to learn all these terms.

563
00:24:43,459 --> 00:24:44,959
I just kind of felt stupid sitting there,

564
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:47,900
like I couldn't ask that question.

565
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,841
And I don't want you to be in that position.

566
00:24:50,841 --> 00:24:51,881
So yeah, those are three terms.

567
00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:54,602
There's probably a ton more, which I could go on forever.

568
00:24:54,602 --> 00:24:56,402
I did a whole workshop in Uruguay

569
00:24:56,402 --> 00:24:57,623
about like most of this stuff,

570
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:59,683
but it was four hours long, so this is the condensed version.

571
00:25:02,177 --> 00:25:04,057
So who are we pitching to?

572
00:25:04,057 --> 00:25:06,418
And there's a lot of people on this list

573
00:25:06,418 --> 00:25:08,378
that we are going to be pitching to.

574
00:25:08,378 --> 00:25:09,999
It is not just people with money.

575
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:12,999
So one, you are pitching to your team.

576
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:15,220
So you need to understand the words

577
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,321
and language you use while you're pitching to your team.

578
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:19,501
Also, the assets they're going to require

579
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:20,981
to understand what you're talking about.

580
00:25:20,981 --> 00:25:24,542
You are going to be pitching to people

581
00:25:24,542 --> 00:25:27,383
who play games in your title genre.

582
00:25:27,383 --> 00:25:30,804
It's real easy for me to talk to strategy players about Overland.

583
00:25:31,576 --> 00:25:32,096
Actually, I lied.

584
00:25:32,096 --> 00:25:34,357
It's real easy for Adam to talk to strategy players

585
00:25:34,357 --> 00:25:35,017
about Overland.

586
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:38,717
Usually, they will start throwing around terms

587
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:39,738
that I don't know what they're talking about,

588
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,458
and then I have to sit there and feel stupid,

589
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:44,979
and ask later, what the hell did that mean?

590
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:47,039
But those are the easy people to talk to.

591
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,659
They're already excited about your genre.

592
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,400
You're gonna talk to people,

593
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,220
and you're gonna pitch to people

594
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,781
who don't play games in your genre,

595
00:25:53,781 --> 00:25:55,901
or just literally don't play games,

596
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:58,101
which we do all the time.

597
00:25:58,101 --> 00:25:58,562
We are at PAX.

598
00:25:58,921 --> 00:26:01,262
There is somebody that comes up with,

599
00:26:01,262 --> 00:26:03,304
they don't play games, they're just there to hang out

600
00:26:03,304 --> 00:26:05,025
because they got invited along,

601
00:26:05,025 --> 00:26:07,346
and you have to talk to them about your game.

602
00:26:07,346 --> 00:26:12,089
And, extra points, hard mode if you can get them to play it.

603
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:14,471
You have to talk to journalists who are very different

604
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:17,232
from the people above this.

605
00:26:17,232 --> 00:26:19,954
Platform dev relations, who are very different,

606
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:24,317
they have different goals in mind.

607
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:27,619
You have to talk to investors who have money.

608
00:26:28,178 --> 00:26:31,621
And their concerns are different from everybody above this.

609
00:26:31,621 --> 00:26:34,122
They overlap a lot with platform dev relations,

610
00:26:34,122 --> 00:26:38,886
but investors are money, they are just money.

611
00:26:38,886 --> 00:26:41,708
And you have to talk to publishers

612
00:26:41,708 --> 00:26:44,531
who are people who are so excited about your game

613
00:26:44,531 --> 00:26:45,992
that they are willing to take the risk

614
00:26:45,992 --> 00:26:48,253
and add it to their library

615
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:50,415
to put it out next to all their other stuff.

616
00:26:50,415 --> 00:26:52,817
Also make money, that's a thing.

617
00:26:53,444 --> 00:26:55,725
But their concerns are different from everybody else

618
00:26:55,725 --> 00:26:56,246
on this list.

619
00:26:56,246 --> 00:26:58,607
And you need to understand who you're talking to

620
00:26:58,607 --> 00:27:01,729
and how you're talking to them in your pitch.

621
00:27:01,729 --> 00:27:06,631
Because all of these people are a version of your pitch.

622
00:27:06,631 --> 00:27:11,294
Sorry, I love this.

623
00:27:11,294 --> 00:27:14,515
So the idea that often the best ways to talk about your game

624
00:27:14,515 --> 00:27:16,937
comes from people out, or comes from inside,

625
00:27:16,937 --> 00:27:18,658
like I know the most about my game.

626
00:27:19,415 --> 00:27:21,235
I know exactly how to talk about it.

627
00:27:21,235 --> 00:27:21,836
That's BS.

628
00:27:21,836 --> 00:27:24,697
I guarantee you that whatever you've decided

629
00:27:24,697 --> 00:27:29,499
is the appropriate way to talk about your game

630
00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:30,619
it has holes in it.

631
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:34,841
Often the best ideas come from people

632
00:27:34,841 --> 00:27:36,781
outside of your development process

633
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:37,582
and outside of your team

634
00:27:37,582 --> 00:27:40,483
who are explaining your game back to you.

635
00:27:40,483 --> 00:27:42,243
And I'm encouraging you to steal

636
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,744
all the words they're saying.

637
00:27:44,744 --> 00:27:45,865
Every single one of them.

638
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:47,525
Be the raccoon.

639
00:27:47,525 --> 00:27:48,786
Take all the food and run.

640
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,700
Everything I say about Overland,

641
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,361
my one-line Overland pitch literally came from a journalist

642
00:27:55,361 --> 00:27:57,101
and a random person at a PAX.

643
00:27:57,101 --> 00:28:04,383
Overland is a procedurally generated, no, no, no.

644
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:08,044
I have like metadata in my head right now,

645
00:28:08,044 --> 00:28:09,344
so I have like five versions of this.

646
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:12,705
Oh, I should have written it down so I didn't forget it,

647
00:28:12,705 --> 00:28:15,165
because I have the long version.

648
00:28:15,165 --> 00:28:18,286
I'll get there, I'll throw it out in a second.

649
00:28:20,353 --> 00:28:22,755
Anyway, the journalists came up with a new genre,

650
00:28:22,755 --> 00:28:26,237
which was survival strategy, which was perfect.

651
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:31,300
It encompasses exactly what Overland is like instantly.

652
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:36,204
And the post-apocalyptic road trip across North America,

653
00:28:36,204 --> 00:28:39,146
that's the end of it, like literally was somebody's like,

654
00:28:39,146 --> 00:28:43,648
oh yeah, you're on a post-apocalyptic across North America.

655
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,509
It was so perfect, and I was like,

656
00:28:44,509 --> 00:28:46,190
oh my God, write this down right now,

657
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,532
like instantly, this is perfect.

658
00:28:48,915 --> 00:28:52,757
you're playing a turn-based survival strategy game

659
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:55,079
about a road trip while you're driving

660
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:56,479
across post-apocalyptic America.

661
00:28:56,479 --> 00:29:00,201
And then you can fall out of that in a really natural way.

662
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:05,084
You are stealing gas, collecting squad,

663
00:29:05,084 --> 00:29:08,686
stealing a car, and scavenging for supplies.

664
00:29:08,686 --> 00:29:10,727
You can sort of condense all this down

665
00:29:10,727 --> 00:29:12,688
into two sentences.

666
00:29:12,688 --> 00:29:14,188
We didn't come up with that.

667
00:29:14,188 --> 00:29:15,209
We're not smart enough for that.

668
00:29:16,014 --> 00:29:18,175
We just borrowed it from people who were telling us

669
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:19,116
literally about our own game

670
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:24,198
that had been living in our house for years.

671
00:29:24,198 --> 00:29:26,599
Other places that you get this information from,

672
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,940
people in your community who are playing your game.

673
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,221
We were just on Train Jam,

674
00:29:30,221 --> 00:29:34,382
and I was playing a friend, Jake,

675
00:29:34,382 --> 00:29:35,243
who was making a card game,

676
00:29:35,243 --> 00:29:38,064
and I will break virtually every game,

677
00:29:38,064 --> 00:29:38,844
and I broke his as well,

678
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:41,466
because I play everything wrong.

679
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:42,866
But we were playing the game,

680
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:45,067
and he's like, I need you to describe everything.

681
00:29:45,653 --> 00:29:48,874
that's happening, like just talk while you're playing.

682
00:29:48,874 --> 00:29:51,635
That is an incredibly useful thing to do,

683
00:29:51,635 --> 00:29:53,796
and it kind of makes players a little bit uncomfortable,

684
00:29:53,796 --> 00:29:54,916
but if all you're doing is listening

685
00:29:54,916 --> 00:29:56,497
and maybe asking questions here and there,

686
00:29:56,497 --> 00:29:57,657
this is how you're going to find out

687
00:29:57,657 --> 00:29:58,918
what your game actually is.

688
00:29:58,918 --> 00:30:03,579
So, talk to people, make people tell you

689
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:07,140
about your own game.

690
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,401
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna tell you about this now.

691
00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:12,402
So, I just wanted to make sure it wasn't later.

692
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:18,146
I'm not sure how many people here are familiar with panoramical, but it's this really beautiful

693
00:30:18,146 --> 00:30:24,188
musical interactive experience that we published years ago made by David Kanaga and Fernando

694
00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:24,428
Hermijo.

695
00:30:24,428 --> 00:30:27,089
And they're both incredibly brilliant.

696
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:31,390
Panoramical is basically impossible to describe to any human alive.

697
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,611
And I took it to shows because I'm like, let's try to figure this out.

698
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:36,952
And I still couldn't figure it out.

699
00:30:36,952 --> 00:30:40,353
We just like just lengthy forever sort of like, well, you're not going to get it.

700
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:45,828
manipulating landscapes with like MIDI boards and it's beautiful and the music's incredible and

701
00:30:45,828 --> 00:30:51,292
that's too long and people are glazing over. I'm like, whatever, just play it. And that's what we

702
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:57,376
sort of fell to, just play it, just play it. And then one person at, it's like an RTX or something,

703
00:30:57,376 --> 00:31:02,199
like it wasn't even like a big show. This dude came by and he's like, I find this game fascinating.

704
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:05,441
I love it, but I can't describe it. He's like, this is a challenge. And he like just left. And

705
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:07,302
I thought I'd never see him again.

706
00:31:07,793 --> 00:31:10,195
And it was the next day he came running back by

707
00:31:10,195 --> 00:31:11,675
and he's like, I got it.

708
00:31:11,675 --> 00:31:13,476
It is Fantasia for video games.

709
00:31:13,476 --> 00:31:15,898
Instant.

710
00:31:15,898 --> 00:31:18,179
It's perfect.

711
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:21,440
It is completely perfect.

712
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,141
I can't put that in an article.

713
00:31:23,141 --> 00:31:23,722
I can't say that.

714
00:31:23,722 --> 00:31:26,683
I can hint at it in an interview or something.

715
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:31,846
But for the common person, that was my pitch in a sentence.

716
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:33,827
It's Fantasia for video games.

717
00:31:33,827 --> 00:31:36,808
You're manipulating a soundscape and a landscape.

718
00:31:37,584 --> 00:31:40,486
to create a beautiful experience.

719
00:31:40,486 --> 00:31:43,067
Done.

720
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,888
So thank you, Random Dude, at RTX in like 2015.

721
00:31:45,888 --> 00:31:48,329
I don't even know who he is,

722
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:51,771
but it was so useful at that point.

723
00:31:51,771 --> 00:31:52,912
So listen to people.

724
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:54,472
How are they describing your game?

725
00:31:54,472 --> 00:31:57,994
And literally steal those words.

726
00:31:57,994 --> 00:31:59,315
Please watch out for acronyms,

727
00:31:59,315 --> 00:32:01,556
especially when you're talking to general public,

728
00:32:01,556 --> 00:32:04,017
and especially when you're talking to publishers.

729
00:32:04,017 --> 00:32:04,757
If you're making an RPG,

730
00:32:04,757 --> 00:32:06,638
whoa.

731
00:32:08,071 --> 00:32:10,932
I don't know what any of those acronyms mean.

732
00:32:10,932 --> 00:32:11,772
I have to Google them.

733
00:32:11,772 --> 00:32:16,413
And if you say it in person, I have to pull out my phone

734
00:32:16,413 --> 00:32:19,474
and be like, is this a thing or did they just invent it?

735
00:32:19,474 --> 00:32:22,575
And a lot of people literally just invent new acronyms

736
00:32:22,575 --> 00:32:25,176
on the front of RPG that don't mean anything.

737
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:28,057
And then sometimes they say I invented a new genre.

738
00:32:28,057 --> 00:32:31,058
I'm sure you did, but we don't know what it means.

739
00:32:31,058 --> 00:32:32,518
There has got to be a better way.

740
00:32:32,518 --> 00:32:33,958
So be careful with your acronyms.

741
00:32:35,172 --> 00:32:38,114
And ask yourself right now, are you so far in game development culture

742
00:32:38,114 --> 00:32:40,515
that your language cannot be parsed by a regular person?

743
00:32:40,515 --> 00:32:43,577
Next time you go home, test yourself.

744
00:32:43,577 --> 00:32:47,519
Like, try to get into a conversation with, like, anyone not in games

745
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,341
and see how many times you have to stop and explain yourself.

746
00:32:51,341 --> 00:32:54,783
And then use those skills of the stopping and explaining yourself

747
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:57,125
for when you talk to anyone outside of games.

748
00:32:57,125 --> 00:33:00,246
I do it all the time when I go home and talk to Adam's parents.

749
00:33:00,246 --> 00:33:03,948
Adam's dad worked in computers, so he's, like, definitely, like, tech management.

750
00:33:04,295 --> 00:33:08,197
But our specialties are so far on the opposite side.

751
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:10,378
So we'll talk shop, which is really fun,

752
00:33:10,378 --> 00:33:11,979
talking shop with your father-in-law,

753
00:33:11,979 --> 00:33:13,360
because he's retired now, and he's like,

754
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,561
yeah, tell me about all this bureaucracy, Beck.

755
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:18,602
But I have to stop myself and explain

756
00:33:18,602 --> 00:33:21,363
through all the pieces, so then I don't lose him

757
00:33:21,363 --> 00:33:24,285
in a conversation, and it might be really easy.

758
00:33:24,285 --> 00:33:26,506
I might say third party.

759
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:30,047
My third party dev relations means literally nothing

760
00:33:30,047 --> 00:33:32,548
to anyone outside of this room or this conference.

761
00:33:33,003 --> 00:33:35,345
It might not even mean anything here.

762
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:36,205
Does anyone know?

763
00:33:36,205 --> 00:33:36,686
Not know?

764
00:33:36,686 --> 00:33:37,246
It's okay.

765
00:33:37,246 --> 00:33:38,327
Third party dev relations?

766
00:33:38,327 --> 00:33:38,887
Thank you.

767
00:33:38,887 --> 00:33:41,569
Third party dev relations is my Sony representative.

768
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:43,151
They're the persons in charge

769
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:45,933
of independent game developers in Sony.

770
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:48,795
They have a whole division called third party.

771
00:33:48,795 --> 00:33:50,296
And that's the person you talk to.

772
00:33:50,296 --> 00:33:52,118
I don't get to talk to second party,

773
00:33:52,118 --> 00:33:54,219
which usually there's like some money involved,

774
00:33:54,219 --> 00:33:55,020
like with second party.

775
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:58,302
They're like more triple A games

776
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:00,504
or the console's investing money in them.

777
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:03,333
And then first party is like they literally just own it.

778
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:06,316
Second party gets a little wishy,

779
00:34:06,316 --> 00:34:08,018
so it's like the easy version.

780
00:34:08,018 --> 00:34:09,559
But we are third party.

781
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:11,161
If you're indie, you're third party.

782
00:34:11,161 --> 00:34:13,243
So if somebody throws that name out,

783
00:34:13,243 --> 00:34:14,084
that's what they're talking about.

784
00:34:14,084 --> 00:34:15,565
But I have to talk through that

785
00:34:15,565 --> 00:34:18,048
if I talk to literally anyone outside of games.

786
00:34:18,048 --> 00:34:21,972
So yeah, there's also like within the game itself,

787
00:34:21,972 --> 00:34:23,773
Overland, all those regions,

788
00:34:23,773 --> 00:34:25,775
we call them internally, we call them biomes.

789
00:34:27,462 --> 00:34:29,743
Nobody uses that word in real life, come on.

790
00:34:29,743 --> 00:34:32,924
And I have to stop Adam regularly when he does interviews.

791
00:34:32,924 --> 00:34:37,487
Like regions, areas, sections of the United States,

792
00:34:37,487 --> 00:34:40,288
geographic locations, literally anything else but biome.

793
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:43,550
Most people can't even spell the damn word.

794
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,590
Don't use it.

795
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:49,493
The average person doesn't know what roguelike is.

796
00:34:49,493 --> 00:34:51,374
I know everyone in here is like, really, what?

797
00:34:51,374 --> 00:34:52,995
I still need a definition on the regs

798
00:34:52,995 --> 00:34:54,355
and I'm tactically making a roguelike.

799
00:34:54,355 --> 00:34:56,637
It has roguelike pieces.

800
00:34:57,212 --> 00:34:58,513
And I'm like, I don't know.

801
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,316
I just can't memorize it.

802
00:35:01,316 --> 00:35:03,317
And now all of you are like, this woman is an idiot.

803
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:04,739
It's fine.

804
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:05,439
Crafting.

805
00:35:05,439 --> 00:35:08,942
If you throw down crafting outside of literally people

806
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:11,124
at this conference, what are you talking about?

807
00:35:11,124 --> 00:35:13,546
The ability to make things.

808
00:35:13,546 --> 00:35:18,070
Use the words that it actually means.

809
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,392
So we, in Overland especially, we use like close calls,

810
00:35:20,392 --> 00:35:22,854
we use narrow escapes, not just a strategy game.

811
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:23,775
It's a sprawling story.

812
00:35:24,048 --> 00:35:27,510
Words that evoke emotion, words that evoke gameplay,

813
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,912
but we don't rely on gamer language.

814
00:35:31,912 --> 00:35:36,055
So yeah, you might need to know the required terminology,

815
00:35:36,055 --> 00:35:37,755
but if you're talking to a lot of people,

816
00:35:37,755 --> 00:35:40,637
especially people with money, investors,

817
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:45,160
they may not know words like roguelike,

818
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,061
words like crafting, and that is okay.

819
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:47,781
Explain them.

820
00:35:47,781 --> 00:35:51,863
So you gotta meet your audience halfway.

821
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,841
Can you talk to experts and also to those who know nothing about video games?

822
00:35:55,841 --> 00:35:57,762
Practice, practice all the time.

823
00:35:57,762 --> 00:36:00,903
Can you quickly identify common ground in a conversation

824
00:36:00,903 --> 00:36:03,604
and explain complex terms and shared experience?

825
00:36:03,604 --> 00:36:07,946
This is one that's really hard because it means you actually have to be paying attention

826
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:12,908
when you're talking to see if people look away or if they're trying to escape.

827
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:16,280
or if they sort of toned out,

828
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,320
or if they took a step back.

829
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,120
Like there's a lot of body language that's there

830
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,741
that will tell you if somebody has no idea

831
00:36:21,741 --> 00:36:22,641
what the F you're talking about.

832
00:36:22,641 --> 00:36:26,482
And do you know how your work might fit

833
00:36:26,482 --> 00:36:28,222
into the broader culture of media?

834
00:36:28,222 --> 00:36:30,263
Have you even thought about how your game fits

835
00:36:30,263 --> 00:36:32,443
into how people are playing today?

836
00:36:32,443 --> 00:36:34,503
What's going on politically?

837
00:36:34,503 --> 00:36:36,144
What cool movies have come out?

838
00:36:36,144 --> 00:36:36,944
Is there a neat book?

839
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,164
Have you even thought about it?

840
00:36:38,164 --> 00:36:40,885
Because that will help you talk about your game.

841
00:36:40,885 --> 00:36:42,985
My game's about post-apocalyptic America.

842
00:36:46,032 --> 00:36:46,573
Come on.

843
00:36:46,573 --> 00:36:49,293
Night in the Woods, we didn't start out

844
00:36:49,293 --> 00:36:51,053
with Night in the Woods coming out

845
00:36:51,053 --> 00:36:55,234
literally after our last American election,

846
00:36:55,234 --> 00:36:56,834
but it did.

847
00:36:56,834 --> 00:36:57,615
And we just changed,

848
00:36:57,615 --> 00:37:00,175
we knew we were gonna be asked a bunch about this

849
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:03,896
because it's about a small town in the middle of America

850
00:37:03,896 --> 00:37:06,976
with people, why do people stay in small places?

851
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:08,937
Think about these things

852
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:11,957
when you're talking about your game.

853
00:37:14,788 --> 00:37:15,108
So yeah.

854
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,368
Okay.

855
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:19,490
So we identified what we're making

856
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,990
and we have a vertical slice to show.

857
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:24,732
And hopefully we've identified at least the person

858
00:37:24,732 --> 00:37:28,073
in front of us that we're trying to talk to.

859
00:37:28,073 --> 00:37:29,574
So now what?

860
00:37:29,574 --> 00:37:30,054
We have stuff.

861
00:37:30,054 --> 00:37:31,475
That's awesome.

862
00:37:31,475 --> 00:37:35,336
We need to understand our pitch materials.

863
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:35,496
Yay!

864
00:37:35,496 --> 00:37:40,118
Now we actually have to talk to somebody

865
00:37:40,118 --> 00:37:41,999
that we want to impress.

866
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:42,639
Pitching!

867
00:37:43,148 --> 00:37:46,390
This is my favorite slide of all time.

868
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,311
I use it literally forever.

869
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:51,852
I am not responsible for it, Adam did.

870
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:56,554
Don't tell people lore.

871
00:37:56,554 --> 00:37:59,896
That is boring trash.

872
00:37:59,896 --> 00:38:01,757
Don't make stuff up.

873
00:38:01,757 --> 00:38:03,778
That's a bad idea.

874
00:38:03,778 --> 00:38:06,819
Somewhere in the middle,

875
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:09,080
there's a lie that could be true

876
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,061
and boring trash that might be interesting.

877
00:38:12,209 --> 00:38:13,370
That's your pitch.

878
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:17,893
I can't take responsibility for this, Adam made this,

879
00:38:17,893 --> 00:38:21,997
and I've been literally laughing about it for a year.

880
00:38:21,997 --> 00:38:24,018
But it's so useful with games.

881
00:38:24,018 --> 00:38:26,540
Like, the number of people that come up to me

882
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:30,323
and shout lore at me, like, oh, just don't do it.

883
00:38:30,323 --> 00:38:31,944
I don't care about the wizards.

884
00:38:31,944 --> 00:38:35,066
I don't care about the space machines, marines.

885
00:38:35,066 --> 00:38:39,670
I literally don't care what's your gameplay loop,

886
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,791
what's the mechanic, why is it fun?

887
00:38:43,122 --> 00:38:44,203
That's what I want to know.

888
00:38:44,203 --> 00:38:45,123
Why is it fun?

889
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,224
Why am I going to sit down and play this?

890
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:51,325
If it's the story, tell me why the story matters

891
00:38:51,325 --> 00:38:53,085
in a cultural context.

892
00:38:53,085 --> 00:38:55,386
Don't tell me the story.

893
00:38:55,386 --> 00:38:57,047
I want to read the book.

894
00:38:57,047 --> 00:38:58,467
I want to watch the movie.

895
00:38:58,467 --> 00:39:00,568
I want to play the game to experience the story.

896
00:39:00,568 --> 00:39:02,488
So when we talk about May, the cat,

897
00:39:02,488 --> 00:39:03,849
who's a 20-year-old college dropout

898
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:07,610
who moves home to a rust belt town in middle America,

899
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,491
instantly you know the setting, the place,

900
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:10,271
and how old she is.

901
00:39:10,587 --> 00:39:12,048
and she just dropped out of college.

902
00:39:12,048 --> 00:39:14,430
And she starts hanging around with her friends,

903
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:16,752
screwing around and vandalizing things.

904
00:39:16,752 --> 00:39:18,893
She's gonna end up in the woods

905
00:39:18,893 --> 00:39:20,334
and she's gonna go through some stuff.

906
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:22,436
But I don't need to tell you anything more than that.

907
00:39:22,436 --> 00:39:25,678
That's all the lore you need about Night in the Woods.

908
00:39:25,678 --> 00:39:27,339
I don't need to tell you about mental illness.

909
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:30,982
I don't need to tell you about fighting with her mom.

910
00:39:30,982 --> 00:39:32,503
I don't need to tell you that her dad

911
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,584
also lost his union job.

912
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:35,965
I don't need to tell you about the mines.

913
00:39:35,965 --> 00:39:37,246
I don't need to tell you about,

914
00:39:37,246 --> 00:39:39,448
I don't need to tell you about any of those things.

915
00:39:40,109 --> 00:39:41,369
Who's the main character?

916
00:39:41,369 --> 00:39:42,530
What's she doing?

917
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:47,191
Why do I want to experience her life with her?

918
00:39:47,191 --> 00:39:50,151
So yeah, good pitches are in the middle.

919
00:39:50,151 --> 00:39:52,012
Leave out the boring trash.

920
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:55,152
Leave out the lies, even though those are real fun.

921
00:39:55,152 --> 00:39:56,192
Leave them out.

922
00:39:56,192 --> 00:39:58,893
And once you have that,

923
00:39:58,893 --> 00:40:02,094
you are going to put together a pitch document.

924
00:40:02,094 --> 00:40:04,474
Sorry.

925
00:40:04,474 --> 00:40:06,575
We build these in something like Keynote or PowerPoint,

926
00:40:06,575 --> 00:40:09,295
and I'm gonna give you a few reasons why.

927
00:40:09,295 --> 00:40:09,515
One.

928
00:40:10,403 --> 00:40:12,884
When you pitch, that is not the only time

929
00:40:12,884 --> 00:40:15,004
that pitch document will be used.

930
00:40:15,004 --> 00:40:16,305
When you build these pitches,

931
00:40:16,305 --> 00:40:18,546
you are going to save them off on a PDF.

932
00:40:18,546 --> 00:40:21,267
You are going to email them to the person you're talking to.

933
00:40:21,267 --> 00:40:24,568
And the reason for that is the person you're pitching to

934
00:40:24,568 --> 00:40:26,709
is not the decision maker.

935
00:40:26,709 --> 00:40:28,910
They literally have to go and talk to somebody else.

936
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:31,551
For consoles, they have to take it back

937
00:40:31,551 --> 00:40:32,611
to the portfolio team.

938
00:40:32,611 --> 00:40:35,432
They will take your pitch deck in.

939
00:40:35,432 --> 00:40:36,572
They'll print it out, usually,

940
00:40:36,572 --> 00:40:37,773
so it's gonna look like garbage.

941
00:40:37,773 --> 00:40:39,513
So make sure it's big and splashy.

942
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:42,426
and they will put it down in a meeting,

943
00:40:42,426 --> 00:40:44,187
because they have about seven billion each week,

944
00:40:44,187 --> 00:40:45,768
and they will discuss your game

945
00:40:45,768 --> 00:40:47,509
without you standing there to explain it.

946
00:40:47,509 --> 00:40:51,772
So my pitch documents are really, really simple.

947
00:40:51,772 --> 00:40:54,093
First page, key art, which I'll talk about,

948
00:40:54,093 --> 00:40:58,096
basically big, pretty splash screen, and the title.

949
00:40:58,096 --> 00:41:00,518
And then I put on the bottom of it what I want.

950
00:41:00,518 --> 00:41:04,040
I want to be an Xbox console launch exclusive.

951
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,402
I want to be a PlayStation 4 launch,

952
00:41:07,402 --> 00:41:08,583
or PlayStation 5 launch title.

953
00:41:09,053 --> 00:41:10,594
I want to be on Switch.

954
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:13,096
I want your money.

955
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,297
Whatever.

956
00:41:14,297 --> 00:41:16,619
Pick who it's for and put it at the bottom of this.

957
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:18,441
That way you don't get them effed up.

958
00:41:18,441 --> 00:41:19,742
This is for you,

959
00:41:19,742 --> 00:41:21,323
because if you send Xbox,

960
00:41:21,323 --> 00:41:24,586
PlayStation pitch gets a little awkward.

961
00:41:24,586 --> 00:41:25,347
So make sure you actually put,

962
00:41:25,347 --> 00:41:27,909
because they're all different pitch documents, by the way,

963
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:29,951
make sure you label which one it is

964
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:30,972
so you don't strip your file names.

965
00:41:31,784 --> 00:41:34,105
So these are example pages, you can't read any of them,

966
00:41:34,105 --> 00:41:36,147
but these are sort of what our pages look like

967
00:41:36,147 --> 00:41:37,528
for our Overland pitch documents

968
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:39,470
that we did like two years ago, year ago.

969
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:43,773
This far one has information in paragraph form

970
00:41:43,773 --> 00:41:46,836
about the game, but it's only about half

971
00:41:46,836 --> 00:41:48,677
of like a long description.

972
00:41:48,677 --> 00:41:51,059
The important parts are bolded right at the top,

973
00:41:51,059 --> 00:41:53,881
and that is our one-liner.

974
00:41:53,881 --> 00:41:55,883
We have quotes on there because we're kind of

975
00:41:55,883 --> 00:41:57,705
an early access, first access game,

976
00:41:57,705 --> 00:41:58,525
so people have reviewed it.

977
00:41:59,345 --> 00:42:02,347
The second one has, it literally says,

978
00:42:02,347 --> 00:42:06,489
award-winning art direction, award-winning gameplay,

979
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:09,191
which are true, those aren't lies.

980
00:42:09,191 --> 00:42:11,292
100 plus hours of replay, which is true

981
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:12,353
because we have people doing it.

982
00:42:12,353 --> 00:42:15,995
Super slick visuals, which is true

983
00:42:15,995 --> 00:42:18,457
because Heather Penn's amazing.

984
00:42:18,457 --> 00:42:20,258
And then it sort of goes down from there.

985
00:42:20,258 --> 00:42:25,101
We also have procedurally generated gameplay

986
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:26,322
and it bullet points out.

987
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:31,212
Really short, simple features.

988
00:42:31,212 --> 00:42:32,172
You want to give them features

989
00:42:32,172 --> 00:42:34,533
because they need to know how to sell it.

990
00:42:34,533 --> 00:42:37,074
Because they're going to take this information

991
00:42:37,074 --> 00:42:38,895
and shove it into some demographic thing,

992
00:42:38,895 --> 00:42:42,236
which will spit out whether they can afford

993
00:42:42,236 --> 00:42:43,897
to get behind your game or not.

994
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:45,858
That's my last page.

995
00:42:45,858 --> 00:42:47,599
I start with art, I end with art.

996
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:53,321
And then I put stuff in the middle.

997
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:56,342
So what kind of deliverable art goes into a pitch deck?

998
00:42:57,438 --> 00:42:58,539
And they're assets.

999
00:42:58,539 --> 00:42:59,540
And this is another term.

1000
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,562
They're metadata assets.

1001
00:43:01,562 --> 00:43:02,042
This is key art.

1002
00:43:02,042 --> 00:43:04,644
This is character art.

1003
00:43:04,644 --> 00:43:05,965
These are screenshots.

1004
00:43:05,965 --> 00:43:08,928
These are things you're going to have to prepare,

1005
00:43:08,928 --> 00:43:11,230
and you need to think through what they look like,

1006
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:15,133
because you can't just open your game

1007
00:43:15,133 --> 00:43:18,296
and go print screen and be like, good enough.

1008
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:21,059
That's not putting your best foot forward.

1009
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:22,400
You didn't think through that.

1010
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,302
You're just like, I have to deliver something.

1011
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:24,962
This works.

1012
00:43:25,407 --> 00:43:27,308
Think through how you want to present your game.

1013
00:43:27,308 --> 00:43:29,208
What's the most beautiful thing

1014
00:43:29,208 --> 00:43:30,529
that you can put in a pitch deck?

1015
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:32,669
What will make somebody the most excited about it?

1016
00:43:32,669 --> 00:43:36,290
So I'm gonna have some examples of the three games

1017
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,831
that we kind of already went through

1018
00:43:37,831 --> 00:43:42,212
and how key art will change through the development process.

1019
00:43:42,212 --> 00:43:46,153
So these are all three versions

1020
00:43:46,153 --> 00:43:47,153
of key art for Night in the Woods.

1021
00:43:47,153 --> 00:43:49,734
The bottom was launch key art

1022
00:43:49,734 --> 00:43:52,995
and that was kind of good enough.

1023
00:43:53,955 --> 00:43:56,236
because we came in to launch a little hot.

1024
00:43:56,236 --> 00:43:58,216
So this was all stuff Scott did really early on,

1025
00:43:58,216 --> 00:44:01,158
and it is beautiful, it's colorful,

1026
00:44:01,158 --> 00:44:03,098
and it does show the game.

1027
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:08,540
This is especially important for pixel art games.

1028
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:12,982
Pixel art, key art, these are huge pieces of art.

1029
00:44:12,982 --> 00:44:15,303
Often pixel art doesn't present well,

1030
00:44:15,303 --> 00:44:18,204
especially low-pile-y pixel.

1031
00:44:18,204 --> 00:44:22,046
So Celeste, they just did this beautiful,

1032
00:44:22,046 --> 00:44:23,026
I can't remember who they hired.

1033
00:44:23,407 --> 00:44:24,667
I can see it in my brain.

1034
00:44:24,667 --> 00:44:26,907
But they did this beautiful piece of art for Celeste

1035
00:44:26,907 --> 00:44:28,928
for their key art,

1036
00:44:28,928 --> 00:44:31,188
like external to what the game actually looks like.

1037
00:44:31,188 --> 00:44:32,189
That's fine.

1038
00:44:32,189 --> 00:44:35,870
What you're doing with key art is you are

1039
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:36,810
proposing a mood.

1040
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:38,230
You're proposing an art style.

1041
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:40,931
You're proposing what the game is going to feel like.

1042
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:44,492
And it's okay to do a painted piece of art

1043
00:44:44,492 --> 00:44:46,612
for a pixel art game for your key art.

1044
00:44:46,612 --> 00:44:47,552
That's fine.

1045
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:50,913
It's going to probably end up on a 10-foot wide banner

1046
00:44:50,913 --> 00:44:51,733
at a PAX someday.

1047
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:53,901
Think through that.

1048
00:44:53,901 --> 00:44:56,722
How's it going to scale up?

1049
00:44:56,722 --> 00:45:00,463
So yeah, the bottom version, that was our PlayStation.

1050
00:45:00,463 --> 00:45:02,644
I think we used that maybe for Xbox,

1051
00:45:02,644 --> 00:45:04,084
and that somehow ended up for Nintendo,

1052
00:45:04,084 --> 00:45:07,325
because they were all separate launches.

1053
00:45:07,325 --> 00:45:09,766
Generally, you try to keep them the same,

1054
00:45:09,766 --> 00:45:14,027
but we couldn't find the bottom art

1055
00:45:14,027 --> 00:45:15,848
when we went to launch later.

1056
00:45:15,848 --> 00:45:19,769
We had lost the Dropbox folder, because Scott

1057
00:45:19,769 --> 00:45:21,650
had gotten a new computer, and things just

1058
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:22,430
got lost for a while.

1059
00:45:22,931 --> 00:45:26,333
That happened with the trailers too, it was real awkward.

1060
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:30,775
But all of them, you can tell they're all from the same game

1061
00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:32,516
from start to finish.

1062
00:45:32,516 --> 00:45:33,597
And also the light looks way better

1063
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:34,698
on the Nintendo storefront.

1064
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:40,461
This is our current key art for Overland.

1065
00:45:40,461 --> 00:45:42,262
This is not my final key art though.

1066
00:45:42,262 --> 00:45:44,583
I'm not doing this, I'm not redoing our key art

1067
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:47,065
for another two months-ish.

1068
00:45:47,065 --> 00:45:49,626
That's coming at the end of Content Complete.

1069
00:45:49,626 --> 00:45:51,567
But this is what we're using now,

1070
00:45:51,567 --> 00:45:52,568
and we use it everywhere.

1071
00:45:52,945 --> 00:45:56,208
It has our logo, and it has our squad of people,

1072
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:59,331
and it has our car, it has our doggos,

1073
00:45:59,331 --> 00:46:00,853
which is very important.

1074
00:46:00,853 --> 00:46:03,716
And we use this a lot, and it can be cut up

1075
00:46:03,716 --> 00:46:07,019
in different forms, depending on where it's needed.

1076
00:46:07,019 --> 00:46:10,702
Early Overland Key, however, looked like this.

1077
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:12,945
And that's my favorite part,

1078
00:46:12,945 --> 00:46:15,507
when we thought we were going to launch it.

1079
00:46:15,507 --> 00:46:16,228
That didn't happen.

1080
00:46:17,988 --> 00:46:20,550
This is our tunic key art, painted background.

1081
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:22,512
It even has an old logo font on it.

1082
00:46:22,512 --> 00:46:24,614
We actually changed it for E3 last year,

1083
00:46:24,614 --> 00:46:26,596
but that's our old typeface.

1084
00:46:26,596 --> 00:46:28,417
We use this all over the place.

1085
00:46:28,417 --> 00:46:30,519
It's on a big giant banner at all of my PAXs.

1086
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:31,620
This is key art.

1087
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,203
This is what it looks like,

1088
00:46:34,203 --> 00:46:35,884
and this is kind of how it's used.

1089
00:46:35,884 --> 00:46:40,809
So other than key art, we have screenshots.

1090
00:46:40,809 --> 00:46:43,652
Now, take a picture of this

1091
00:46:44,022 --> 00:46:46,583
You're going to want that, because this is going to go into a ton of detail.

1092
00:46:46,583 --> 00:46:49,904
I could do a three-hour talk just on screenshot theory.

1093
00:46:49,904 --> 00:46:53,205
I'm going to go through a lot of questions that we ask ourselves

1094
00:46:53,205 --> 00:46:55,186
when we literally post any screenshot ever.

1095
00:46:55,186 --> 00:47:02,109
Okay. I'm going to go one, two, three, disappearing.

1096
00:47:02,109 --> 00:47:03,209
Oh, no, it's not.

1097
00:47:03,209 --> 00:47:03,729
Good. Phew.

1098
00:47:03,729 --> 00:47:08,871
Okay. What is your game's main attraction, aka the fantasy?

1099
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:12,973
When you look at your screenshot, can you answer that question?

1100
00:47:12,973 --> 00:47:13,733
And can somebody else?

1101
00:47:15,085 --> 00:47:17,706
Does your screenshot showcase that main attraction?

1102
00:47:17,706 --> 00:47:22,187
Does your screenshot show directionality?

1103
00:47:22,187 --> 00:47:24,227
This means, can you tell where your character's moving?

1104
00:47:24,227 --> 00:47:26,608
Does your screenshot show the movement?

1105
00:47:26,608 --> 00:47:29,208
There's a really beautiful thing that we have,

1106
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:31,409
like if you take any screenshot of Night in the Woods,

1107
00:47:31,409 --> 00:47:33,549
where Mae's running, you can tell where she's running.

1108
00:47:33,549 --> 00:47:34,589
And you can tell on the screen

1109
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:35,890
everywhere that she can jump to,

1110
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:41,411
just based on the way the whole thing is designed.

1111
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:42,071
Into the breach.

1112
00:47:43,579 --> 00:47:46,619
Every screenshot in Into the Breach is perfect.

1113
00:47:46,619 --> 00:47:49,060
You can tell everything that's happening in the game

1114
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:49,660
by one screenshot.

1115
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,962
Does the screenshot show the main gameplay loop

1116
00:47:53,962 --> 00:47:57,843
and Into the Breach is amazing at this.

1117
00:47:57,843 --> 00:48:00,764
Where does your game spend all of its time?

1118
00:48:00,764 --> 00:48:04,385
What is the player's identity and available actions?

1119
00:48:04,385 --> 00:48:06,385
What sorts of objects and items are there?

1120
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:08,526
Before, during, and after,

1121
00:48:08,526 --> 00:48:11,267
can you tell what just happened or what will happen?

1122
00:48:11,816 --> 00:48:13,957
Can you read the directionality and lines of action

1123
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:14,457
in the game?

1124
00:48:14,457 --> 00:48:17,278
What changes in the game as you move through it?

1125
00:48:17,278 --> 00:48:19,519
This can all be communicated in a screenshot,

1126
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:21,200
and you should ask yourself these questions.

1127
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:25,301
Are the environments or backdrops quite different

1128
00:48:25,301 --> 00:48:27,202
from screenshot to screenshot?

1129
00:48:27,202 --> 00:48:28,843
Is there variety in your game?

1130
00:48:28,843 --> 00:48:33,585
Does the player identity change or shift?

1131
00:48:33,585 --> 00:48:34,745
In Overland, that's the case.

1132
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:36,986
All of our players are procedurally generated.

1133
00:48:36,986 --> 00:48:39,427
Do the actions available to them

1134
00:48:39,427 --> 00:48:41,048
change from screenshot to screenshot?

1135
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,058
Does a stranger need to have played this actual game

1136
00:48:44,058 --> 00:48:46,100
in order to tell what's up in this screenshot?

1137
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:50,242
Do they only need to have played other games in your genre?

1138
00:48:50,242 --> 00:48:51,303
Very useful for strategy.

1139
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:55,506
Do they only need to be vaguely aware

1140
00:48:55,506 --> 00:48:58,008
of the notion of what a video game is?

1141
00:48:58,008 --> 00:49:00,169
That's Adam being cheeky.

1142
00:49:00,169 --> 00:49:03,431
But can they tell in the screenshot that it's a video game?

1143
00:49:03,431 --> 00:49:06,053
Like, this is actually kind of important

1144
00:49:06,053 --> 00:49:08,595
for something like Firewatch.

1145
00:49:10,568 --> 00:49:12,289
They did a really good job of this,

1146
00:49:12,289 --> 00:49:14,791
but sometimes if they had changed a few things,

1147
00:49:14,791 --> 00:49:16,372
you wouldn't know if that was, is that an animation?

1148
00:49:16,372 --> 00:49:17,492
Is that a screenshot?

1149
00:49:17,492 --> 00:49:21,535
It's like, what do we do in Firewatch?

1150
00:49:21,535 --> 00:49:23,736
And they actually did a great job going around that.

1151
00:49:23,736 --> 00:49:27,838
So that is a very brief screenshot theory.

1152
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:32,321
Read the blog post that we did, which we update all the time.

1153
00:49:32,321 --> 00:49:35,743
It's lengthy, and it'll ask you lots of questions,

1154
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,063
and it has a ton of examples

1155
00:49:37,063 --> 00:49:39,405
of what all of these questions are referring to.

1156
00:49:40,109 --> 00:49:43,051
And we've spent literally three years

1157
00:49:43,051 --> 00:49:45,754
documenting all this stuff.

1158
00:49:45,754 --> 00:49:47,135
So after you have your screenshots,

1159
00:49:47,135 --> 00:49:49,356
which you literally will put in that pitch document,

1160
00:49:49,356 --> 00:49:53,039
you also probably should have some sort of gameplay video.

1161
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:56,302
We rely on trailers because we make them internally,

1162
00:49:56,302 --> 00:49:57,903
but they're very small.

1163
00:49:57,903 --> 00:49:59,544
We spend less than seven days on them.

1164
00:49:59,544 --> 00:50:02,026
And I have two examples of trailers from Overland

1165
00:50:02,026 --> 00:50:05,149
that were done about a year apart.

1166
00:50:05,149 --> 00:50:07,611
So I want to show you what things we were showing

1167
00:50:07,611 --> 00:50:09,592
to consuls and investors and the public.

1168
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:13,702
from year to year in development,

1169
00:50:13,702 --> 00:50:18,806
because it's okay to make things better as you go.

1170
00:50:18,806 --> 00:50:19,847
So here's the first one.

1171
00:50:19,847 --> 00:50:22,109
Oh, no, go back.

1172
00:50:22,109 --> 00:50:23,089
Don't have to click on that.

1173
00:50:23,089 --> 00:50:23,129
So.

1174
00:50:23,129 --> 00:50:23,210
So.

1175
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:23,250
So.

1176
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:29,314
So.

1177
00:50:29,314 --> 00:50:29,394
So.

1178
00:50:29,394 --> 00:50:29,434
So.

1179
00:50:29,434 --> 00:50:29,475
So.

1180
00:50:29,475 --> 00:50:29,515
So.

1181
00:50:29,515 --> 00:50:29,555
So.

1182
00:50:29,555 --> 00:50:29,595
So.

1183
00:50:29,595 --> 00:50:29,635
So.

1184
00:51:22,193 --> 00:51:24,975
Okay, so that was 2016.

1185
00:51:24,975 --> 00:51:30,177
The game looks, I mean, you can tell it's the same game now,

1186
00:51:30,177 --> 00:51:33,278
but the art, that is so early.

1187
00:51:33,278 --> 00:51:35,779
But we used that, one, for our first access,

1188
00:51:35,779 --> 00:51:37,220
but two, we took this around.

1189
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,481
I needed to communicate that this game

1190
00:51:38,481 --> 00:51:40,201
was procedurally generated,

1191
00:51:40,201 --> 00:51:43,963
and that the people in it were super vulnerable.

1192
00:51:43,963 --> 00:51:48,205
And then a year later, after we had kind of changed

1193
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,686
a lot of the art style, we went here.

1194
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,240
Oh, no, no, no, go back.

1195
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,621
You are supposed to be here now.

1196
00:51:57,621 --> 00:51:57,921
Go over.

1197
00:51:57,921 --> 00:51:57,961
Oh.

1198
00:51:57,961 --> 00:51:58,001
Oh.

1199
00:51:58,001 --> 00:51:58,081
Oh.

1200
00:51:58,081 --> 00:51:58,221
Oh.

1201
00:51:58,221 --> 00:51:58,361
Oh.

1202
00:51:58,361 --> 00:51:58,401
Oh.

1203
00:51:58,401 --> 00:52:01,862
Oh.

1204
00:52:01,862 --> 00:52:15,725
Oh.

1205
00:52:15,725 --> 00:52:16,725
Oh.

1206
00:52:16,725 --> 00:52:16,765
Oh.

1207
00:52:16,765 --> 00:52:16,905
Oh.

1208
00:52:16,905 --> 00:52:17,485
Oh.

1209
00:52:17,485 --> 00:52:17,685
Oh.

1210
00:52:17,685 --> 00:52:17,945
Oh.

1211
00:52:17,945 --> 00:52:18,025
Oh.

1212
00:52:18,025 --> 00:52:18,085
Oh.

1213
00:52:18,085 --> 00:52:18,145
Oh.

1214
00:52:18,145 --> 00:52:18,185
Oh.

1215
00:52:18,185 --> 00:52:18,265
Oh.

1216
00:52:18,265 --> 00:52:18,325
Oh.

1217
00:52:18,325 --> 00:52:18,365
Oh.

1218
00:52:18,365 --> 00:52:18,405
Oh.

1219
00:52:18,405 --> 00:52:18,445
Oh.

1220
00:52:27,674 --> 00:52:33,738
It's probably going to get a little loud.

1221
00:52:33,738 --> 00:52:40,863
It starts recording in just a minute.

1222
00:53:17,344 --> 00:53:19,545
So those two trailers are back to back,

1223
00:53:19,545 --> 00:53:20,686
and that one's from like 2017.

1224
00:53:20,686 --> 00:53:23,947
They're telling two different stories.

1225
00:53:23,947 --> 00:53:25,308
One is a gameplay trailer,

1226
00:53:25,308 --> 00:53:27,088
because we wanted people to buy in.

1227
00:53:27,088 --> 00:53:29,189
The other is mood.

1228
00:53:29,189 --> 00:53:31,891
This game has a lot of different variety.

1229
00:53:31,891 --> 00:53:34,672
And I was using this to communicate to both the public,

1230
00:53:34,672 --> 00:53:36,853
but also publishers and investors.

1231
00:53:36,853 --> 00:53:38,273
I needed them to see the scope and scale

1232
00:53:38,273 --> 00:53:39,714
that we were working on.

1233
00:53:39,714 --> 00:53:41,095
It is okay to do this.

1234
00:53:41,095 --> 00:53:43,256
You can change things around.

1235
00:53:43,256 --> 00:53:45,917
Both of these things took like five-ish days

1236
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:46,577
to put together.

1237
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:51,672
And we did them internally, so it was only on our own budget.

1238
00:53:51,672 --> 00:53:54,333
So once you have assets, and you've thought through your assets,

1239
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:55,793
you've asked questions about your assets,

1240
00:53:55,793 --> 00:53:58,635
and you've taken these assets and asked other people, like,

1241
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:01,756
is this communicating what I want it to communicate?

1242
00:54:01,756 --> 00:54:03,737
Don't be in your bubble. Get your blinders off.

1243
00:54:03,737 --> 00:54:06,218
This is so important. Ask other people.

1244
00:54:06,218 --> 00:54:10,600
You're going to have to send an email to somebody

1245
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:14,342
if it's publishers, investors, dev relations, journalists.

1246
00:54:14,342 --> 00:54:16,983
For the love...

1247
00:54:17,872 --> 00:54:20,974
of all things holy.

1248
00:54:20,974 --> 00:54:23,795
Pay attention to the words you say.

1249
00:54:23,795 --> 00:54:26,177
I get this once a month.

1250
00:54:26,177 --> 00:54:27,318
I wish I was kidding.

1251
00:54:27,318 --> 00:54:29,219
We were sort of making fun of it last year

1252
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:33,662
at the email talk that Adrian and Ben were doing.

1253
00:54:33,662 --> 00:54:34,803
But I do, I get it all the time.

1254
00:54:34,803 --> 00:54:37,885
And that pitch might be great,

1255
00:54:37,885 --> 00:54:39,766
but wow, what a lack of attention to detail.

1256
00:54:39,766 --> 00:54:45,449
So learn how and when you should contact possible partners.

1257
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,930
I get pitches all the time.

1258
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:47,611
I don't know why.

1259
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:50,659
I take on literally one game at a time.

1260
00:54:50,659 --> 00:54:56,964
And I don't even have a slot for like two years.

1261
00:54:56,964 --> 00:55:01,507
Know the publisher that you're pitching to.

1262
00:55:01,507 --> 00:55:02,908
I get Android games.

1263
00:55:02,908 --> 00:55:07,952
I haven't published an Android game in ever.

1264
00:55:07,952 --> 00:55:11,815
I have games on Android, but somebody did them

1265
00:55:11,815 --> 00:55:13,637
and I just took them back and set up my own account

1266
00:55:13,637 --> 00:55:15,078
after I had somebody else publish them.

1267
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:17,460
So know who you're talking to.

1268
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,484
look at their library.

1269
00:55:19,484 --> 00:55:22,705
Like there are games that Devolver should be publishing,

1270
00:55:22,705 --> 00:55:26,285
and if you have one of those games, contact them.

1271
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:28,266
But there's probably other publishers

1272
00:55:28,266 --> 00:55:30,406
that are not a super good fit for you.

1273
00:55:30,406 --> 00:55:33,727
So don't necessarily put all your eggs in one basket,

1274
00:55:33,727 --> 00:55:36,148
but identify the baskets that you should even put them in

1275
00:55:36,148 --> 00:55:41,189
in the first place.

1276
00:55:41,189 --> 00:55:43,429
So a question I get asked all the time is,

1277
00:55:43,429 --> 00:55:45,330
should, and we're getting close,

1278
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:45,830
should

1279
00:55:46,482 --> 00:55:50,425
I put my budget in my pitch document.

1280
00:55:50,425 --> 00:55:52,327
No, unless you were asked for it.

1281
00:55:52,327 --> 00:55:54,008
Don't put a budget in a pitch document.

1282
00:55:54,008 --> 00:55:55,570
You want them excited about your game,

1283
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:56,871
you want their eyes to glass over,

1284
00:55:56,871 --> 00:55:59,233
and then you want them to ask for a budget.

1285
00:55:59,233 --> 00:56:02,896
Things you should put in, though.

1286
00:56:02,896 --> 00:56:04,677
Duration of a project.

1287
00:56:04,677 --> 00:56:06,919
How many staff you got, tell me about your team

1288
00:56:06,919 --> 00:56:09,561
and how cool you are.

1289
00:56:09,561 --> 00:56:12,003
And later, when you are doing your budget,

1290
00:56:12,003 --> 00:56:14,605
other things you should add is sort of

1291
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:16,167
how much your staff costs each month.

1292
00:56:17,009 --> 00:56:19,970
You do want to track in your future budget

1293
00:56:19,970 --> 00:56:21,990
building equipment and services,

1294
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:23,851
so like legal, accounting, whatever,

1295
00:56:23,851 --> 00:56:26,191
which is also legal and accounting.

1296
00:56:26,191 --> 00:56:30,592
So services, how much does Maya cost in Unity?

1297
00:56:30,592 --> 00:56:31,892
And if you're really unfortunate,

1298
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:33,333
all the insurance you have to take.

1299
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:36,493
That's the kind of stuff you do need to put on your budget,

1300
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:39,574
but literally do not stick this in your pitch doc.

1301
00:56:39,574 --> 00:56:41,975
It's not necessarily unless I ask for it.

1302
00:56:41,975 --> 00:56:44,395
You can send over an Excel spreadsheet with this.

1303
00:56:44,395 --> 00:56:45,455
You don't gotta make it fancy.

1304
00:56:46,105 --> 00:56:47,345
It just needs to have numbers,

1305
00:56:47,345 --> 00:56:49,805
because that's what they're going to look at.

1306
00:56:49,805 --> 00:56:53,686
They're crunching numbers in an Excel document.

1307
00:56:53,686 --> 00:56:54,987
Or you can send it off in a PDF.

1308
00:56:54,987 --> 00:56:56,907
So yeah, don't send a budget unless you're asked

1309
00:56:56,907 --> 00:56:58,267
for a budget.

1310
00:56:58,267 --> 00:57:00,088
Okay.

1311
00:57:00,088 --> 00:57:02,828
So, understand what you're making.

1312
00:57:02,828 --> 00:57:04,048
Spend time on this.

1313
00:57:04,048 --> 00:57:04,829
Talk to people.

1314
00:57:04,829 --> 00:57:07,749
Understand the people you're talking to.

1315
00:57:07,749 --> 00:57:10,310
Journalists are different from dev relations

1316
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:11,670
who are different from the random person

1317
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:12,610
who walks by your booth.

1318
00:57:14,205 --> 00:57:16,385
Practice talking to these people.

1319
00:57:16,385 --> 00:57:18,346
Think about the ways that you'll communicate

1320
00:57:18,346 --> 00:57:20,086
the ideas about your game.

1321
00:57:20,086 --> 00:57:21,607
Understand the pitch.

1322
00:57:21,607 --> 00:57:24,128
Build your pitch so it's exemplifying your game,

1323
00:57:24,128 --> 00:57:25,528
that it's the most exciting thing

1324
00:57:25,528 --> 00:57:26,949
that you can possibly put together,

1325
00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:28,809
that you get excited when you read it.

1326
00:57:28,809 --> 00:57:32,190
Understand the pitch and who the person is

1327
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:33,510
on the other side receiving it.

1328
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:35,691
What are their end goals?

1329
00:57:35,691 --> 00:57:36,952
And communicate that,

1330
00:57:36,952 --> 00:57:40,333
that your goals are going to overlap.

1331
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:43,413
And understand your deliverables.

1332
00:57:43,692 --> 00:57:46,194
So you don't need to turn in a pitch document tomorrow

1333
00:57:46,194 --> 00:57:48,356
because you're already sitting on assets

1334
00:57:48,356 --> 00:57:50,517
that you thought through today.

1335
00:57:50,517 --> 00:57:54,681
So you can just pull them out of a Dropbox folder somewhere

1336
00:57:54,681 --> 00:57:57,023
and build your document.

1337
00:57:57,023 --> 00:57:58,704
Last minute is obvious.

1338
00:57:58,704 --> 00:57:59,325
We can see it.

1339
00:57:59,325 --> 00:58:06,971
And seriously, good luck.

1340
00:58:06,971 --> 00:58:08,452
It's hard.

1341
00:58:08,452 --> 00:58:09,914
Use friends.

1342
00:58:09,914 --> 00:58:10,534
Get mentorship.

1343
00:58:10,534 --> 00:58:11,915
You guys can do this.

1344
00:58:12,204 --> 00:58:14,997
You have the games to build this stuff.

1345
00:58:14,997 --> 00:58:15,861
Thank you.
