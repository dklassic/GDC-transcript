00:00:01,041 --> 00:00:06,365
Hello friends, I'm Alexander Swords. Welcome to my home office here in Melbourne, Australia,

2
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:10,408
giving this presentation under very different circumstances to what I had intended.

3
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:16,512
The session is The Forest Paths Method for Accessible Narrative Design. I'll just clarify

4
00:00:16,552 --> 00:00:21,455
straight off the bat, the accessible part of that is about the fact that it uses plain

5
00:00:21,475 --> 00:00:25,658
language, it uses simple definitions, and the method is designed to be accessible.

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,783
accessed by the entire team.

7
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:30,645
So to clarify your own ideas

8
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:32,788
and help you collaborate with the rest of your team.

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:34,571
This is me.

10
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:35,852
I'm not gonna go through everything.

11
00:00:35,872 --> 00:00:37,194
I've got qualifications.

12
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:37,935
I've done stuff.

13
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:43,374
The thing that I'm really proud about though is the Forest Paths method.

14
00:00:44,055 --> 00:00:48,319
It's an accumulation of many many years working across a bunch of different mediums.

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:56,908
Basically it's come from a design philosophy of making sure that the power of all stories is recognized in this process.

16
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:58,530
It's plain language.

17
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,532
It's accessible, which means it's also very practical.

18
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:03,693
It's not high level at all.

19
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:09,355
It will literally help you understand how to create the drama that you need to,

20
00:01:09,395 --> 00:01:11,456
to connect with the audience that you'd like to connect with.

21
00:01:11,976 --> 00:01:14,197
It is collaborative at its core,

22
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:18,780
and it helps you integrate considerations that are wider

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,861
than just the narrative design.

24
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,862
So obviously your narrative design impacts the rest of the game development process,

25
00:01:24,182 --> 00:01:26,063
but it also impacts a whole bunch of other things

26
00:01:26,103 --> 00:01:28,364
like streamers, marketing, accessibility, and so on.

27
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,892
You'll see here that I'm starting with a blank spreadsheet.

28
00:01:33,432 --> 00:01:37,015
I think sometimes it's very good for examples to begin at the very beginning.

29
00:01:37,095 --> 00:01:42,098
So literally all I've done is opened up this spreadsheet and renamed it.

30
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:45,460
You'll see at the top left there it's called High Concept Formula.

31
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,622
You'll have to excuse me, I'm going to look at this screen because it's bigger.

32
00:01:49,103 --> 00:01:51,865
This is also the benefit of doing this talk from my home office.

33
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:56,194
So we've got a spreadsheet here and for the first step

34
00:01:56,434 --> 00:02:00,016
in what we're trying to do this is probably one of the

35
00:02:00,757 --> 00:02:06,041
the best ways of starting using a high concept formula. Again this

36
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:08,242
is about making sure you're asking yourself the

37
00:02:08,322 --> 00:02:11,745
right questions more than anything else but it's really super simple.

38
00:02:12,025 --> 00:02:15,668
You have the player which isn't the player

39
00:02:15,688 --> 00:02:18,210
has a character

40
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:33,087
performs activities. You'll see that these are variables, and you're probably guessing these as we go along,

41
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:43,373
that manage resources to overcome obstacles.

42
00:02:48,649 --> 00:02:52,291
goal, whatever that might be. So these are the elements that need to go into a game.

43
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:58,296
Super simple stuff. This is probably a really good place to, you know, if you're starting

44
00:02:58,556 --> 00:03:02,459
ideas for the first time, you're just brainstorming. A really good way of kind of getting your ideas

45
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:06,602
out just in a table with you and your team and try and work out the kind of game that you're

46
00:03:06,622 --> 00:03:07,182
trying to make.

47
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:12,059
I am going to use an example that I've been thinking about,

48
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:16,081
which is going to be a bit more of a mature game, a bit of a game for

49
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:20,803
adults, and trying to get away from

50
00:03:20,843 --> 00:03:24,264
conflict, so to provide a bit of a

51
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:27,345
slightly different example to what you might expect for say a shooter or

52
00:03:27,366 --> 00:03:32,568
a horror game or something like that. So basically the idea that I had was

53
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:34,148
that this is about an old man

54
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:38,713
who lives in the city and as unfortunately what happens sometimes is

55
00:03:39,113 --> 00:03:42,535
with old people they end up being the last people in their friendship circle

56
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:44,957
to to be alive unfortunately they last

57
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:49,359
longer than everyone else important to them and so you know there's

58
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,401
a lot of isolation that comes with that so

59
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:56,644
the idea of this game is that this old old person is is taking a journey

60
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,905
back home to try and reconnect with their roots

61
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:02,347
essentially because that's where they made all their lifelong friends and so

62
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,408
they want to return back there

63
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:09,093
And the general kind of gist, I mean the impetus for this idea too was that I wanted to create a game about

64
00:04:09,293 --> 00:04:14,138
it is about the friends we make along the way, so hopefully we'll get to a narrative design

65
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:19,984
which achieves that before I finish this video. And I also will say like

66
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:30,049
My goal for today's example too is to just get the narrative design to a point where we could come up with a really good solid place to go forward designing a vertical slice.

67
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:44,556
Because it is a new idea and the role playing kind of aspect of this would be that we're a studio maybe, or I'm playing as a solid developer who's coming up with an idea maybe to go for funding or maybe to pitch to the team.

68
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:46,296
So vertical slice is what we're aiming for.

69
00:04:46,757 --> 00:04:53,041
So, the character is an old man

70
00:04:53,061 --> 00:04:56,904
The activities that I've been thinking of

71
00:04:57,444 --> 00:05:01,487
are, you know, so where we want to... I'm going to set it in Australia so we can

72
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,728
travel across Australia

73
00:05:09,432 --> 00:05:13,795
typing skills ahoy and then making friends

74
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:25,915
which you know I guess is you know it's about relationships I guess you know so

75
00:05:25,995 --> 00:05:34,022
resources so time is a factor maybe fuel is a factor and maintenance of the

76
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:38,386
vehicle maintenance

77
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:48,857
maintenance... 10 amps? maintenance of the vehicle

78
00:05:48,877 --> 00:05:50,818
I don't know if that's how you spell maintenance

79
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:55,941
anyway um uh the obstacles uh distance

80
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:58,342
loneliness

81
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:04,065
um i feel like in resources we do put in relationships here

82
00:06:05,604 --> 00:06:09,089
I think, because you know we're managing them. It's something that we're managing

83
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:10,431
and hopefully we'll get something out of it.

84
00:06:10,932 --> 00:06:20,466
And the goal is to return to where we grew up.

85
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:24,467
Cool. So that's a pitch for a game, right?

86
00:06:24,527 --> 00:06:27,308
So, you know, the player is an old man

87
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:28,909
who's traveling across Australia,

88
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,152
maybe making friends as a way of managing time and fuel

89
00:06:34,172 --> 00:06:36,314
and the maintenance of their car,

90
00:06:36,514 --> 00:06:38,035
you know, through these relationships,

91
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:41,096
overcoming distance and loneliness along the way,

92
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:47,080
hopefully, you know, to return to where he grew up.

93
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,181
I'm very comfortable with that.

94
00:06:49,381 --> 00:06:53,925
as a pitch. This would be something that I'd automatically be able to take to the team

95
00:06:54,645 --> 00:06:57,828
to start getting their ideas about whether all of these aspects

96
00:06:58,528 --> 00:07:01,010
or elements we want in the game as they are

97
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:04,433
and start those conversations about

98
00:07:05,273 --> 00:07:08,396
mechanics in particular. This feels a little bit

99
00:07:08,516 --> 00:07:11,418
kind of walking simulator

100
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,741
so far and that's probably where I'm going to

101
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:16,702
take it from this point forward.

102
00:07:17,596 --> 00:07:22,338
So I have just jumped forward a little bit to save you watching me doing some of the tedious stuff.

103
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:28,802
Basically what I've done is created a matrix here and set up what we need to go forward but

104
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:34,524
what we're going to do next though is this is exactly what we just did, our high concept formula.

105
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:37,746
I've stuck the word can in front of it, I put the question at the end of it and that

106
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:42,468
now makes it a dramatic question. So can the old man travel across Australia making friends?

107
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,010
managing time, fuel, maintenance and relationships

108
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,751
to overcome distance and loneliness

109
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:50,192
to return to where he grew up.

110
00:07:50,632 --> 00:07:52,332
Those of you who are familiar with the dramatic question,

111
00:07:52,553 --> 00:07:53,753
there's no surprises there.

112
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,014
Those of you who aren't familiar,

113
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:56,034
just have a quick Google.

114
00:07:56,874 --> 00:07:59,315
It's not very deep to understand,

115
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,376
although the use of it can be super deep.

116
00:08:04,018 --> 00:08:06,880
But the next thing we want to do is have a look at this matrix.

117
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:13,325
Now, simply put, from left to right is time progressing through the game, through the

118
00:08:13,365 --> 00:08:14,266
gameplay experience.

119
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:20,070
And then each of these are sequences, and each of these sequences are broken up into

120
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:21,992
– I've got five different elements.

121
00:08:22,352 --> 00:08:26,755
These elements that I've got here are from the variables that we've got from the high

122
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:27,696
concept formula.

123
00:08:27,756 --> 00:08:32,340
But these elements should change depending on what genre you're doing, what type of game

124
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:32,860
you're playing.

125
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:37,785
you know, what questions you're trying to answer for yourself.

126
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:44,171
And so, you know, they might even change over the process of doing this.

127
00:08:44,952 --> 00:08:47,294
But the first thing we will do is across the top here we have,

128
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:48,495
so this is the dramatic question.

129
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:51,738
This is where we want the answers to that dramatic question.

130
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:59,765
So what I want to do though is, this is feeling like a bit of a walking simulator, so the answers

131
00:08:59,785 --> 00:09:06,212
to these questions are either yes or no, and because of the genre of walking simulators,

132
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:14,240
generally a yes is the player feels like that they can move forward through the experience

133
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,582
without any kind of really hard pushback.

134
00:09:16,942 --> 00:09:23,713
Obviously a no is the opposite of that. A no is when the player feels like they can't move forward without a definitive

135
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:27,238
gate being opened or you know an obstacle being overcome.

136
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:28,861
But for us it's a walk...

137
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:38,172
of to feel like there's any two impediment here. You know these resources shouldn't be,

138
00:09:39,193 --> 00:09:44,196
shouldn't ever completely deplete. They should only be concerns. These obstacles should never

139
00:09:44,336 --> 00:09:53,001
be absolute at any point for most of the experience. I want to mix things up a little bit though.

140
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:56,361
And we're going to have a no here.

141
00:09:57,282 --> 00:10:01,286
And the reason why I want a no is because he wants to return to where he grew up.

142
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:07,674
This is a very tangible goal, but I kind of want to say no to achieving that tangible goal

143
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:13,180
so that we can explore what intangible goals that he might achieve along the way.

144
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,400
So.

145
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,462
you know this is a case of you know usually in cinema terms they call it you know

146
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:22,325
um not getting what you want but getting what you need in this case he wants to

147
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:26,167
return to where he grew up but i want to explore what he needs

148
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:30,769
and you know this is a game that i want to be about the friends we make along

149
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:33,970
the way so in this case here what he wants is to return to where he grew up

150
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,572
but what he needs to do is make friends and so that's the experience that i want

151
00:10:37,592 --> 00:10:38,313
to put the player through

152
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:42,915
So that's going to be a no at that point there. I don't know what that looks like yet.

153
00:10:43,215 --> 00:10:46,738
The good thing about this is, you know, I've got drama there and it's just an intention.

154
00:10:46,778 --> 00:10:49,359
I don't even know what that looks like yet and I don't need to.

155
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:53,842
Also, when you're doing this sort of stuff, it's perfectly fine to start with intention

156
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:56,524
and then work your way into detail. That's perfectly fine.

157
00:10:57,444 --> 00:10:59,025
And that should be what your process is.

158
00:10:59,045 --> 00:11:03,248
The other cool thing about this is that if you want to, you can get your whole team

159
00:11:03,308 --> 00:11:06,250
in front of a screen straight away with this blank document.

160
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,691
and start working with it

161
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:13,193
and then maybe do some analysis along the way or just start with intention

162
00:11:13,393 --> 00:11:16,395
you know that sort of thing. The other thing that I think I'm going to do

163
00:11:16,555 --> 00:11:19,576
because it is we're in walking simulator kind of territory is

164
00:11:21,197 --> 00:11:25,960
I don't think that obstacles are so important as

165
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,161
themes are

166
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:35,023
You know, because it's about making friends and doing that, you know, there's different

167
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:36,424
themes that kind of arise from that.

168
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:41,546
Also too, you know, he's in a very interesting situation being an older person facing isolation.

169
00:11:41,586 --> 00:11:44,767
There's some themes there that, you know, we want to investigate.

170
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:48,589
The other issue is with walking simulators, you know, theme is at the heart of those,

171
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:54,071
you know, so we want to see that reflected in the design that we're doing as well.

172
00:11:54,512 --> 00:12:00,037
I think the other thing too is, you know, because there's a very simple progression

173
00:12:00,157 --> 00:12:04,801
here, there's not going to be too much of a difference in goals going forward.

174
00:12:04,821 --> 00:12:07,964
So I don't really feel like it's something that we need to track through this process.

175
00:12:08,004 --> 00:12:12,148
So, you know, I'm going to put something, I'm going to put intended audience there.

176
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:18,135
instead. Now part of the reason for that is, you know, we're making this as a game

177
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:22,620
for an older audience or for a game for an audience rather who's really

178
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,446
interested in engaging with a specific style of story and this kind of

179
00:12:27,466 --> 00:12:28,447
narrative content so

180
00:12:30,109 --> 00:12:40,754
I'm going to draw a line underneath it just to mark it as this element is not a narrative design element

181
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:48,537
it's a functional element, it's not meant to necessarily impact on anything above it

182
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:52,139
but anything above it, that line, will impact what is below it

183
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:53,939
and I think it's important to kind of keep in mind

184
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:00,893
you know, who our intended audience is and what effect our narrative design is going to have them

185
00:13:00,953 --> 00:13:01,734
through this process.

186
00:13:03,681 --> 00:13:07,682
So, yeah, the other thing that I want to do straight up as well

187
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:10,984
So we do have, in the Forest Paths method, I do have dramatic forces

188
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,185
And these are, they're broken up into two groups

189
00:13:14,225 --> 00:13:17,427
One is dramatic forces over time and the other is between elements

190
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:18,727
And we'll start with over time

191
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:22,109
Because usually what you want for a cohesive narrative design

192
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:25,851
Is some dramatic force being applied that starts at the beginning of the game

193
00:13:27,011 --> 00:13:28,473
and ends at the end of the game.

194
00:13:29,393 --> 00:13:31,855
And that's, a dramatic force is basically

195
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:33,937
a way of understanding the relationship

196
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:35,538
between what the player is expecting

197
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,920
and the drama that's being introduced

198
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,981
by what is unexpected.

199
00:13:40,142 --> 00:13:43,404
And so, you know, straight away,

200
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:47,948
what I want here is there's going to be a transformation

201
00:13:47,968 --> 00:13:48,688
here.

202
00:13:51,856 --> 00:13:58,517
And so transformations are essentially when any element in your narrative design

203
00:13:59,457 --> 00:14:02,338
is having its context change. It's being transformed

204
00:14:03,238 --> 00:14:07,119
as the context around it is being changed or the definition of it is being

205
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,300
changed. So you know typically the example that he

206
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,641
uses, you know, if you have a warrior who's just a warrior and they think

207
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:16,341
that they're just fighting and all of a sudden it turns out that

208
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:19,582
they're a prince or a princess, you know, the context of that character

209
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:20,042
is changed.

210
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:25,025
there is a transformation there from just warrior to warrior prince or warrior princess

211
00:14:27,447 --> 00:14:37,894
in that kind of instance. This transformation though is, you know, we want the story to go from

212
00:14:38,715 --> 00:14:45,459
traveling home to making friends along the way, which so I guess what we what we want is, you

213
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:47,821
know, it's not about the

214
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:54,818
and but about the journey. So we're changing the context of the story here.

215
00:14:54,838 --> 00:14:57,318
There's a transformation of what this story should mean,

216
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,880
that it's, you know, it's not about reaching the goal, it's about the journey

217
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,400
along the way.

218
00:15:04,441 --> 00:15:07,682
Yeah, put in notes for yourself. I have a terrible memory.

219
00:15:07,882 --> 00:15:10,583
I designed this entire system because I have a really terrible memory.

220
00:15:11,003 --> 00:15:14,064
Why should I remember this sort of stuff when I can just create a system?

221
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:17,681
to understand these relationships that come with the diagram.

222
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:22,144
And obviously what's good about this is that other people can see this

223
00:15:24,265 --> 00:15:25,506
and be able to follow it with you.

224
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:30,228
So yeah, I'm not sure that there are any...

225
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:33,250
Yeah, I would say the other dramatic force over time is a reversal.

226
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,212
And we're not really sure what it is yet,

227
00:15:35,972 --> 00:15:39,774
but there's definitely a reversal here from a yes to no.

228
00:15:41,255 --> 00:15:42,156
Reversal of fortune.

229
00:15:43,315 --> 00:15:48,140
This is the traditional definition of what a reversal is, a reversal of fortune.

230
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:52,344
I've expanded that definition to include all reversals where you have one element

231
00:15:52,605 --> 00:15:57,229
that changes from one state to its opposite. In this case it reflects the traditional understanding

232
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:04,156
of fortune going from good to too bad, but there's no reason why it couldn't be from...

233
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:10,532
you know if it's art style from black to white if it's you know if it's time from night to day

234
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:18,536
you know that sort of thing is a reversal and then we've got probably should start looking at

235
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:24,739
any kind of low-hanging fruit that we have as well i mean we don't really have any kind of

236
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:31,722
story there but we can just kind of look at things and go okay you know begins the

237
00:16:33,985 --> 00:16:39,708
begins the journey there. I'm not going to put ends the journey

238
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,449
there because we want this transformation

239
00:16:41,469 --> 00:16:45,911
and this is a no so and we still don't know what that means yet

240
00:16:47,192 --> 00:16:51,034
but maybe then you know what we can kind of do is actually just look at

241
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:55,517
activities and help activities decide for us you know what the story

242
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:59,699
will be and different things. So you know this is pretty simple so

243
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,261
there's two activities here traveling across Australia and making friends.

244
00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:11,385
So why don't we just put travel with a capital because I'm a stickler for things like that.

245
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:15,767
Making friends.

246
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:23,030
Travel. Travel. Travel.

247
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,692
I'm going to leave that one blank because we don't know what we're doing there.

248
00:17:28,753 --> 00:17:30,113
And this one's going to be making friends.

249
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:31,914
And this one's going to be making friends.

250
00:17:33,794 --> 00:17:37,799
Cool, great, we already have a really nice structure there as well

251
00:17:37,939 --> 00:17:40,982
so you know there's a rhythm there the player will be able to

252
00:17:41,142 --> 00:17:46,108
identify and I think you know that's good there's some

253
00:17:46,128 --> 00:17:48,170
structure there that the player will kind of understand about

254
00:17:50,096 --> 00:17:55,160
Resources, so basically I think what's going on here is, you know, the other elements that

255
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:01,005
we've got here are probably going to want to inform us before we even really want to think about

256
00:18:01,385 --> 00:18:09,593
what the actual story is, although, you know, they need to stop to make friends.

257
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:14,737
Yeah.

258
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:26,475
Cool. Okay, so what we might want to do then too is actually now just kind of work out what

259
00:18:26,535 --> 00:18:31,642
resources we'll want to use and when. I feel like, you know, at the beginning it's going to be all good

260
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:35,327
and at the end, you know...

261
00:18:39,222 --> 00:18:46,665
bad maybe this is a work in progress and then what we've got along the way well

262
00:18:46,685 --> 00:18:51,726
what we could probably do is just go you know so let's just make a fuel thing

263
00:18:51,786 --> 00:18:54,167
here and a maintenance thing

264
00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:02,753
here and then a time thing here. Great, awesome, we've ticked off. So you know this isn't to say

265
00:19:02,813 --> 00:19:08,435
that these resources aren't necessarily an issue like in any other point of the narrative design

266
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:12,497
but it just means in these particular sequences this is what we're concentrating on. In sequence

267
00:19:12,537 --> 00:19:19,499
two it's going to be about the player having to stop to manage fuel and the way they're going

268
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,261
to do that is by making friends with someone. That seems pretty simple.

269
00:19:25,843 --> 00:19:32,825
What we might do... Is there a theme there? Well, from the beginning we know that isolation is an

270
00:19:32,865 --> 00:19:39,167
issue. That's something that we want to explore from the beginning. And, you know, the evolution

271
00:19:39,207 --> 00:19:44,449
of that, I guess, if they're making friends or talking to someone, is, you know, the time left.

272
00:19:46,056 --> 00:19:50,398
alive and what to do with it, I think. I mean the cool thing about this is we can

273
00:19:50,418 --> 00:19:52,139
just kind of drop in random ideas here.

274
00:19:53,499 --> 00:19:55,540
Shouldn't be touching my face, coronavirus.

275
00:19:58,121 --> 00:20:00,803
Drop ideas, like just ideas of things that we do want to

276
00:20:00,863 --> 00:20:05,245
to work with here, and then just fold them in

277
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:09,767
at this point. So maintenance here, I mean I feel like...

278
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:16,550
you know losing health as an older person fits really nicely with maintenance being

279
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:21,833
um the issue there so and i guess fuel does too how much fuel is left in the tank how much time

280
00:20:21,873 --> 00:20:27,076
is left alive how much maintenance uh you know maintenance versus losing health you know there's

281
00:20:27,376 --> 00:20:32,118
so what i'm going to do this so this is another dramatic force at play here where you have um

282
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:38,982
you have two elements that have a relationship that cause you know that that create drama in

283
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:40,963
this case it's a it's a synergy

284
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:44,124
between resources and the themes.

285
00:20:46,504 --> 00:20:50,465
Fuel equals time back drive.

286
00:20:50,805 --> 00:20:53,125
And it's important to note these sorts of things.

287
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,606
I mean, this one's basically just for yourself

288
00:20:55,686 --> 00:20:57,126
as a narrative designer, but I guess,

289
00:20:57,146 --> 00:20:59,167
but even in this kind of scenario,

290
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:00,687
if I am the narrative designer,

291
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,667
but it ends up being handed over to a writer,

292
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:05,448
and you know, the writer knows that this is the gold.

293
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:07,448
This is, we want something really special

294
00:21:07,508 --> 00:21:09,928
out of this relationship between resources and themes.

295
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:13,731
in this case particularly being fuel and time left alive.

296
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:22,798
So yeah, and maintenance and losing health, you know, this is probably another synergy.

297
00:21:27,427 --> 00:21:33,877
I'm not even going to talk about the type of note there. We just know that that resource maintenance and losing health is a good synergy there.

298
00:21:36,802 --> 00:21:41,449
Yeah, okay, so I don't know about the last one yet. And that's...

299
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,795
Okay, I think we can leave that there. So do we have enough for a story?

300
00:21:48,137 --> 00:21:55,025
Intended audience. Yeah, so what I'm looking for here is like what impact it will have on

301
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:59,971
the intended audience. And I think beginning the journey, travel, all good, isolation, you know.

302
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,735
I want there to be a sense of hope for the intended audience.

303
00:22:03,935 --> 00:22:06,537
So, you know, it can't be all doom and gloom.

304
00:22:06,637 --> 00:22:10,521
And I'm hoping that, you know, the beginning of journey, the traveling,

305
00:22:10,921 --> 00:22:12,943
everything is all good at the beginning, you know.

306
00:22:13,003 --> 00:22:16,266
So, you know, I want even though this isolation here is the thing,

307
00:22:17,006 --> 00:22:19,388
you know, they're doing some kind of decisive action.

308
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:27,153
you know, so for the intended audience, that's hopefully what they'll be excited about at the beginning of the game

309
00:22:28,115 --> 00:22:29,857
and what they'll kind of engage with.

310
00:22:29,877 --> 00:22:31,039
So, the...

311
00:22:38,406 --> 00:22:39,707
We probably should look at the ending.

312
00:22:40,688 --> 00:22:43,310
And I feel like we're getting a long way ahead

313
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,091
with some of the other stuff

314
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:46,153
without having the ending kind of nailed down

315
00:22:46,193 --> 00:22:47,354
and it's probably time to do so.

316
00:22:47,835 --> 00:22:50,317
So our clue here at the moment that we've got

317
00:22:50,397 --> 00:22:52,579
is that things are all kind of all bad

318
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,722
in terms of the car, in terms of,

319
00:22:54,762 --> 00:22:56,283
that's the resources that we're managing here.

320
00:22:56,303 --> 00:22:58,205
But I can't help but think.

321
00:23:00,707 --> 00:23:05,833
that if this is a no, they're not necessarily getting to return to where they grew up.

322
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,116
That there is, you know, there's some kind of synergy here.

323
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:18,122
even though I don't know what that means yet, although I've got a kind of a sense of where that might be going.

324
00:23:18,402 --> 00:23:21,224
The other issue is we have another dramatic force over time here

325
00:23:22,764 --> 00:23:29,608
between this sequence in the resources and this sequence in the resources as well.

326
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:31,929
There is an escalation here where maintenance is a problem.

327
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:36,994
you know, I guess I'm making the decision to make this a dramatic force, right?

328
00:23:37,034 --> 00:23:40,258
This is, we're in the second half of the game here, we want some kind of drama in

329
00:23:40,298 --> 00:23:42,901
that sense of impending drama, and that can come from an escalation.

330
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:50,155
car suffering, to car dead.

331
00:23:50,356 --> 00:23:51,196
These are my notes,

332
00:23:51,256 --> 00:23:52,997
they don't need to be the best writing in the world.

333
00:23:53,017 --> 00:23:56,679
I'm gonna put a blue on that to let me know.

334
00:23:56,699 --> 00:23:59,501
So that's another dramatic force over time escalation.

335
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,802
Now this isn't progression,

336
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:03,543
progression doesn't necessarily need to be noted on here.

337
00:24:03,904 --> 00:24:05,164
Any escalation is something,

338
00:24:05,184 --> 00:24:08,887
an increase that is beyond what the player expects

339
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:10,268
in whatever element you're dealing with.

340
00:24:10,388 --> 00:24:11,949
So we're dealing with resources here.

341
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,232
So it looks like if you've got this escalation here leading towards the ending,

342
00:24:17,292 --> 00:24:26,879
the ending is that the car is all bad. So that means it stops, you know, car is dead.

343
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:31,002
You know, I feel like

344
00:24:31,022 --> 00:24:31,163
that is

345
00:24:40,755 --> 00:24:54,457
Yeah, all bad. Car is towed. Time is the resource here being managed because car isn't.

346
00:24:56,482 --> 00:25:00,407
functioning, you know, so that's where the sense of urgency is. I'm going to pull this

347
00:25:00,547 --> 00:25:08,616
escalation back to this one here because the car's not functioning here. So, you know,

348
00:25:08,636 --> 00:25:11,098
we've got this escalation. It's still a car suffering two, car dead.

349
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,984
but it's just happening one sequence beforehand. So now we need to work out

350
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:18,547
how we're going to get this character from

351
00:25:21,992 --> 00:25:23,133
wherever they've stopped here

352
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:25,976
to their destination.

353
00:25:30,735 --> 00:25:36,600
I guess where we're going with this is that he's not going to survive this journey, unfortunately.

354
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:44,285
So, old man passes away in a car.

355
00:25:44,305 --> 00:25:46,306
To explain this, because the car isn't functioning either.

356
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:55,893
Car towed to the town where he grew up.

357
00:25:58,504 --> 00:26:05,429
So yeah, so you know in this case then we've got the new friend responsible

358
00:26:05,449 --> 00:26:17,518
you know for returning old man and car to the town where he grew up.

359
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,083
That's a really heavy ending but you know a really powerful one.

360
00:26:24,675 --> 00:26:30,437
and I think that ends up really heightening this sense of,

361
00:26:30,617 --> 00:26:32,057
it is not about the journey,

362
00:26:32,937 --> 00:26:34,838
because unfortunately he didn't survive the journey,

363
00:26:35,558 --> 00:26:37,219
but he did make friends along the way.

364
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:38,499
So it's definitely a case of him

365
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:39,999
not necessarily getting what he wanted,

366
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,200
but he did get what he needed in that.

367
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:52,752
It does obviously pose a bit of a problem for what the player is doing here,

368
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:54,274
but it's not necessarily a problem.

369
00:26:55,596 --> 00:26:59,101
But the player controls new friend.

370
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:06,293
perhaps. So what I might do actually is that the car is towed

371
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:13,577
the car is going to be towed to the town. Old man gets

372
00:27:13,877 --> 00:27:19,900
lift with new friend but old man

373
00:27:20,861 --> 00:27:23,682
passes on the final leg.

374
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:34,540
leg as well. So, you know, this would be a case of the player is driving the old man

375
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:39,767
back to, along this final leg, back to the old town and then he passes along the way.

376
00:27:40,808 --> 00:27:50,456
And there's something I really like about that. It means that, you know, it's a bit of a shift for the players' perspective because now they're playing this new friend who they've possibly never met before.

377
00:27:50,737 --> 00:28:05,389
But there's also something really lovely to be had there about this new friend being responsible and so this player being responsible for the final moments of this old man that they've had this really kind of strong relationship with along the way.

378
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:08,750
But we've only got a few minutes left and we're aiming for a vertical slice.

379
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:11,891
So what we probably want to do here is have

380
00:28:13,532 --> 00:28:17,373
something kind of worked out, at least two sequences where we have, you know,

381
00:28:17,433 --> 00:28:20,614
something kind of fleshed out a bit better for a vertical slice experience.

382
00:28:21,014 --> 00:28:22,435
What I probably want to do is have.

383
00:28:24,044 --> 00:28:32,094
a travel sequence and a conversation sequence in this. So you know what we probably want to do

384
00:28:32,715 --> 00:28:36,961
is, you know, this is probably going to be our vertical experience.

385
00:28:38,947 --> 00:28:42,329
that we're aiming for. So we just now we just need to make sure that this is the

386
00:28:42,369 --> 00:28:44,971
section that we've got complete to hand over

387
00:28:45,011 --> 00:28:49,474
for the rest of the team. So traveling

388
00:28:51,895 --> 00:28:56,798
talking to themselves while driving

389
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,360
responding to

390
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:14,083
music they're listening to. Cool, so that's... look, we're putting nostalgia there. The nostalgia

391
00:29:14,303 --> 00:29:19,908
from the themes is going to be prompted by the music they're listening to. Traveling...

392
00:29:25,332 --> 00:29:34,315
branching dialogue. So the player gets to navigate, I guess, the internal thought process

393
00:29:35,456 --> 00:29:37,157
of the old man making friends.

394
00:29:40,175 --> 00:29:41,597
through dialogue as well.

395
00:29:41,837 --> 00:29:43,118
There doesn't need to be any trade.

396
00:29:43,358 --> 00:29:45,820
There doesn't need to be any kind of inventory management.

397
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:48,563
And I don't want this to be about conflict either.

398
00:29:49,343 --> 00:29:51,305
They have to stop,

399
00:29:53,447 --> 00:29:56,710
stops to get something minor.

400
00:30:00,553 --> 00:30:01,234
Something minor.

401
00:30:02,014 --> 00:30:02,835
Actually, stop to get.

402
00:30:05,422 --> 00:30:10,566
noise investigated so you know there's a bit of a foreshadowing there about the car is kind of on

403
00:30:10,606 --> 00:30:17,390
its on its last legs um stops to get noise investigated um making a friend maintenance

404
00:30:18,991 --> 00:30:27,937
talks to um what do they call them uh talks to repair man no repair person

405
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:33,500
Because they're not all men.

406
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:37,221
It's really bad that we have this kind of gendered language ingrained in our English.

407
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:42,202
Stops to get noise investigated, talks to a repair person.

408
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:46,743
And now I know that this conversation is going to be mostly about the car's health,

409
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:50,445
but some of it will also be, you know, they'll be referring to their own health as well.

410
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:54,245
and maybe that'll be a bit of an issue. So the cool thing is I don't even need to

411
00:30:54,365 --> 00:30:56,686
necessarily know who this character is that they're talking to.

412
00:30:57,446 --> 00:31:00,787
This is enough that I could go to the rest of my team and have a start

413
00:31:01,967 --> 00:31:07,368
starting a conversation with them about what this looks like.

414
00:31:08,088 --> 00:31:10,308
So intended audience, losing health,

415
00:31:10,408 --> 00:31:17,570
intended audience, you know, relating to other people that are common.

416
00:31:24,452 --> 00:31:29,276
Yeah, I mean I know it's a bit of a cliché I guess for old people to talk about what

417
00:31:29,397 --> 00:31:36,222
ails them, but you know, I want everyone in the team to know that this is what we're aiming

418
00:31:36,282 --> 00:31:41,026
for, that it should be actually about two people relating to each other, you know, about

419
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:42,548
this experience.

420
00:31:42,588 --> 00:31:45,110
So there's going to be something about the character that this old man is talking to

421
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:48,052
obviously that they will be able to relate to the old man.

422
00:31:49,593 --> 00:31:54,174
We also, you know, so we've got this synergy here, we also know that this escalation needs to work.

423
00:31:54,214 --> 00:32:03,237
So if we're creating this for the vertical slice, we know that these elements here need to function to deliver on the promise of, you know, this transformation that runs through the entire experience,

424
00:32:03,637 --> 00:32:09,179
as well as this escalation that needs to be paid off in the second to last sequence.

425
00:32:09,619 --> 00:32:11,139
Cool, so we've got that sequence there.

426
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,840
We do want a trailing sequence though.

427
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,180
Resources.

428
00:32:15,472 --> 00:32:21,093
I'm not really sure there are any resources that are being managed there that we need to include here

429
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:25,013
because it is about nostalgia. To a certain degree we don't want any resources here.

430
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:29,614
Maybe we even just want to let the player drive for as long as they want to drive.

431
00:32:29,674 --> 00:32:30,654
This is a slow game.

432
00:32:33,475 --> 00:32:35,435
And so what could be interesting

433
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:41,636
for our intended audience is a time for self-reflection.

434
00:32:43,103 --> 00:32:46,566
which isn't something that, you know, older people necessarily are short of

435
00:32:47,126 --> 00:32:51,630
because, you know, with the isolation comes time for them to think for themselves

436
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,774
but, you know, this is a bit more of a structured, you know, it's almost a bit of a

437
00:32:56,814 --> 00:33:01,277
could be a bit of a structured meditation, this sequence, in its style

438
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:05,861
and, you know, let's put that there

439
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:13,051
And for us in Australia, you know, these long drives are part of our culture,

440
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:17,172
you know, and part of a long tradition of what it is to be Australian

441
00:33:17,192 --> 00:33:20,053
because we live in such a big country with cities that are so far apart.

442
00:33:21,093 --> 00:33:23,153
So, you know, I think this is something that a lot of people,

443
00:33:23,393 --> 00:33:24,994
particularly in Australia, would kind of relate to.

444
00:33:25,274 --> 00:33:26,474
And there is something kind of,

445
00:33:26,494 --> 00:33:30,235
you know, structured meditation around these long drives.

446
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:32,936
You do get in a frame of mind that you don't necessarily get in

447
00:33:32,956 --> 00:33:36,917
when you're traveling to work or even just sitting on your own in the house.

448
00:33:37,555 --> 00:33:43,320
So I feel like, you know, if our goal is to achieve, you know, enough of a narrative

449
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,664
designed to go ahead with developing a vertical slice, I feel like we've got that here.

450
00:33:48,684 --> 00:33:54,389
I'm just going to put talking to themselves in the sequence here so that we know

451
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:58,192
story-wise at least where we're going here.

452
00:33:58,793 --> 00:34:04,076
So the cool thing is, right, we now have what I call the beginning of a narrative design pattern,

453
00:34:04,096 --> 00:34:07,718
and part of the reason why I don't call it a template or I don't call it a plan is because

454
00:34:08,178 --> 00:34:12,881
some of this stuff has very specific detail and some of this really just has vague intention and

455
00:34:12,901 --> 00:34:18,083
some of it is perfectly blank. And that's because this pattern is evolving. This should be a living

456
00:34:18,123 --> 00:34:23,366
document that kind of evolves as the team, you know, develop the game. It should evolve as

457
00:34:23,426 --> 00:34:24,587
iterations kind of happen.

458
00:34:25,047 --> 00:34:29,772
And hopefully what can happen is because you have this diagram that starts to put these

459
00:34:29,812 --> 00:34:34,037
kind of dramatic relationships together between the different sequences, between the different

460
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:39,923
elements, you'll understand the implication of any changes as development goes forward.

461
00:34:41,953 --> 00:34:45,815
Obviously, I haven't taken you through the entire method this time around.

462
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:51,057
So if you are interested in the method more, please take a look at the book.

463
00:34:51,097 --> 00:34:52,798
And it's less of a plug to buy the book.

464
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:57,360
It's only not for a lot of money available on Amazon at the moment.

465
00:34:57,801 --> 00:35:01,863
but it will explain to you and give you more examples about how to use this method.

466
00:35:02,824 --> 00:35:06,787
But you know, what you can take away from this right now, even if you don't look at the book, is

467
00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:11,150
you know, ask yourself these questions when you're starting to put an idea together.

468
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:15,333
Think about these different elements and start to think about how they relate together,

469
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:18,255
you know, as you're kind of deciding what variables you want in the game.

470
00:35:18,935 --> 00:35:21,657
And then start putting your ideas into a matrix.

471
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:25,740
Ignore the dramatic forces, ignore the Forrest Pyle's method if you like,

472
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,543
but just start understanding that you should be working in these matrices,

473
00:35:29,783 --> 00:35:31,805
you should be breaking the game down into elements,

474
00:35:32,605 --> 00:35:36,108
the design pillars of your game, and then trying to understand how.

475
00:35:37,149 --> 00:35:40,212
these different elements relate to each other at any given moment in the game

476
00:35:40,493 --> 00:35:44,718
and what the relationships, you know, how those elements

477
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:50,024
evolve over time through the play experience.

478
00:35:52,326 --> 00:35:56,409
Yeah, so I hope that this has helped give a bit of an insight into the method.

479
00:35:56,669 --> 00:35:59,691
And even if you're not interested in pursuing the method, just a way of

480
00:36:00,611 --> 00:36:03,794
understanding how you might want to kind of organize your thoughts going forward

481
00:36:04,094 --> 00:36:08,437
and trying to get from those different stages, from intention into detail

482
00:36:08,757 --> 00:36:11,859
or from working on your own, clarifying your own ideas

483
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:14,821
into working with your team in a collaborative way.

484
00:36:15,964 --> 00:36:19,346
Thank you very much for tuning in and watching this video.

485
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:24,508
I really appreciate your time and that you have a thirst for knowledge about narrative design.

486
00:36:24,888 --> 00:36:29,350
It is an evolving art, science, ongoing experiment.

487
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:36,092
So any feedback would be very, very grateful and available on Twitter.

488
00:36:36,732 --> 00:36:40,594
So please reach out if you have any questions or comments about this.

489
00:36:40,974 --> 00:36:44,456
And I hope I do get to talk to you all in person really soon.

490
00:36:44,976 --> 00:36:45,276
Thank you.

491
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:54,352
So I'm just going to take the opportunity to summarize some key points.

492
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:57,335
The high concept formula was the kind of first big one that I started using.

493
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:03,380
There's the variables there for you as well as a bit of an explanation and some examples.

494
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,821
Take a look at those in your own time.

495
00:37:06,102 --> 00:37:09,664
Also, these are dramatic forces over time. This is the list. You've got the reversals,

496
00:37:09,704 --> 00:37:14,306
you've got escalations, you've got transformations. Obviously, storytelling is very subjective,

497
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:19,829
so this is about actually establishing what's expected, and then these dramatic forces should

498
00:37:19,869 --> 00:37:25,691
be above what is expected. This is the changes that you should see over time in your narrative.

499
00:37:26,352 --> 00:37:28,553
And then we've got these dramatic forces between elements.

500
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:34,358
The synergy, opposition and absence, didn't use all of these in the example today.

501
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:41,745
Absence in particular is tricky and comes from Japanese traditional storytelling more

502
00:37:41,785 --> 00:37:44,207
than anywhere else, it seems from my research.

503
00:37:44,787 --> 00:37:48,651
But also there's just the list there for you to refer to again later.

504
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:52,110
So thank you, that's all from me today.

505
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,791
I really appreciate you spending the time,

506
00:37:54,491 --> 00:37:56,853
even virtually, to come to my talk.

507
00:37:57,994 --> 00:37:59,675
I am available on Twitter, please reach out.

508
00:37:59,835 --> 00:38:01,796
I always love to get feedback from people.

509
00:38:02,336 --> 00:38:03,517
And of course, if you want to see

510
00:38:03,537 --> 00:38:05,459
the Forest Paths Method in full,

511
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:07,940
if you want to see more diagrams and examples,

512
00:38:08,601 --> 00:38:09,841
then the book is available.

513
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,303
I really appreciate your time and your support

514
00:38:12,543 --> 00:38:14,945
and the opportunity that GDC is giving me

515
00:38:15,145 --> 00:38:16,306
and presenting to you today.

516
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:18,707
Keep on making great stories.
