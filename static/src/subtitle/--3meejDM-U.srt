00:00:12,107 --> 00:00:17,429
Okay, I hope you all can hear me. Sorry for not being on the video feed. My name is John

2
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:21,851
Ingalls and I'm the narrative director of Inkle. Hopefully you've heard of us. We're

3
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:27,133
a small independent game studio from the UK and we specialize in making narrative games.

4
00:00:27,173 --> 00:00:32,316
We've been around for about 10 years and done a whole bunch of stuff. So here is some of

5
00:00:32,356 --> 00:00:32,776
that stuff.

6
00:00:34,593 --> 00:00:37,036
Some of which you may know, some of which you may not know.

7
00:00:37,216 --> 00:00:39,519
It's quite an eclectic catalogue in some ways.

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,922
But the one that I want to talk about today,

9
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:45,086
but I'm going to talk more generally about a kind of genre of games

10
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,388
and some design strategies.

11
00:00:46,408 --> 00:00:47,669
But the one I want to especially focus on

12
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,751
is the one that's in red at the bottom corner there, which is Overboard.

13
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:57,392
Now, Overboard is an Agatha Christie style murder mystery game

14
00:00:57,492 --> 00:01:00,253
with the neat twist that you're the murderer and your role as the player

15
00:01:00,273 --> 00:01:01,293
is to try and get away with it.

16
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:03,173
That sounds like a spoiler, but it's not.

17
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:07,574
That said, the talk has got quite a lot of spoilers in it.

18
00:01:07,654 --> 00:01:09,315
I haven't really been cautious to avoid them.

19
00:01:09,515 --> 00:01:11,435
So hopefully you've explored.

20
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:15,578
overboard a little bit for yourselves and already formed your opinion about whether you like it or not.

21
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:19,281
So before I start talking about detective games, which is what I really want to do,

22
00:01:19,602 --> 00:01:22,544
I better talk a little bit about Overboard just to ground the conversation.

23
00:01:23,104 --> 00:01:28,549
So what kind of game is it? Well, it declares itself as a visual novel.

24
00:01:28,669 --> 00:01:30,810
It looks on the surface like a visual novel.

25
00:01:32,754 --> 00:01:37,923
it on every screen of the game pretty much. It has these two characters within a location and

26
00:01:37,943 --> 00:01:41,269
they're talking to each other, right, and there are dialogue choices and those choices affect

27
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:42,291
the way the conversation goes.

28
00:01:43,462 --> 00:01:45,963
But in other ways, it's really an adventure game.

29
00:01:46,123 --> 00:01:49,004
Actually, there's a map screen, which you can see in the bottom corner there.

30
00:01:49,504 --> 00:01:51,865
And you choose which location you're going to visit.

31
00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:57,007
And not all the options that you get in a given location actually are dialogue.

32
00:01:57,027 --> 00:01:58,447
There's lots of actions to take.

33
00:01:58,507 --> 00:02:00,628
You can pick things up. You can drop things.

34
00:02:00,668 --> 00:02:02,569
There are keys and there are locks and things like that.

35
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:06,030
All of which is much more similar to Monkey Island than it is to,

36
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,651
you know, choices or episodes on the on the app store.

37
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,631
But in reality, I don't really think it's a visual novel or an adventure game.

38
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:19,313
And for me, it's much closer to a 1980s text adventure game like these two,

39
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:22,574
which is not surprising because I grew up playing 1980s text adventure games and I

40
00:02:22,614 --> 00:02:26,415
grow into my position as a designer by writing text adventure games.

41
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:30,016
and no one really remembers them very well anymore.

42
00:02:30,376 --> 00:02:31,976
Some people do, but not all that many,

43
00:02:32,937 --> 00:02:36,217
but they were routinely surprisingly complicated.

44
00:02:36,317 --> 00:02:37,998
So these two that I've got on screen at the moment,

45
00:02:38,058 --> 00:02:40,538
Deadline from 1982, released when I was one,

46
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:42,759
and Suspect, released a couple of years later.

47
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:45,919
Both of them have multi-location environments

48
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:47,680
that you can wander around freely.

49
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,140
They have an in-game clock, which affects what...

50
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:52,984
state those locations are in when you get to them.

51
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:57,931
They obviously go to different places at different times,

52
00:02:57,991 --> 00:02:58,992
yields different results,

53
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,535
and that's a big part of the gameplay.

54
00:03:02,923 --> 00:03:06,386
have casts of characters, really quite large casts of characters.

55
00:03:06,866 --> 00:03:08,608
Suspect is unreasonably difficult.

56
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:09,969
It has so many characters in it.

57
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:14,233
And these are characters with memories and knowledge who react to the things

58
00:03:14,253 --> 00:03:17,016
they discover during the course of a gameplay and they move around independently.

59
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:20,179
They don't stand in one place waiting to be spoken to like a Bethesda guard.

60
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:21,600
They move around and they do things

61
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,543
and you can see them doing things if you hide and things like that.

62
00:03:25,544 --> 00:03:28,486
And generally speaking, the idea of the game of both of these games.

63
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:32,697
is not to proceed through an adventure,

64
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:35,099
through a linear story from beginning to end,

65
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,221
proceed through a script like you might do

66
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:39,182
if you were playing Grim Fandango or something,

67
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:42,885
but rather to find information.

68
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:47,572
from the location, from the environment, or from one character, and then use that information to

69
00:03:47,652 --> 00:03:51,994
cajole another character into telling you more. And you wouldn't really play the game from beginning

70
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:57,097
to end, much more you'd play them over and over again until you had a picture of the world and

71
00:03:57,117 --> 00:04:03,621
the story and whatever the secrets of the locations were, and then you would use those to solve the

72
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:09,104
game. So these games are definitely not visual novels, obviously, they're not really adventure

73
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,446
games, even by the standards of text adventures from the 80s. So

74
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:15,507
I don't know what to call them, but the most obvious label seems to be the simplest one,

75
00:04:15,809 --> 00:04:17,274
which is they are detective games.

76
00:04:18,035 --> 00:04:23,057
Now there's no agreed definition that I can find of what makes a detective game into a detective

77
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:29,118
game. There's a category on Steam and GOG, but it tends to cover a pretty wide range of experiences

78
00:04:29,258 --> 00:04:33,599
and is often more about setting and the tone than the actual mechanics. So if we want a mechanics

79
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:39,720
based concept of a detective game, I would suggest it's something like this. It's a kind of short

80
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:45,442
term game loop in which there's some kind of core discovery which feeds deduction, which feeds the

81
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:47,402
discovery, and we go round and round like that.

82
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:51,544
So to make that a bit more specific so I can say exactly what I'm talking about,

83
00:04:52,384 --> 00:04:57,227
firstly we go out into the game and we find a thing. Great, we found a thing. Secondly,

84
00:04:57,487 --> 00:05:02,109
we think about the thing. And then thirdly, because the game can't tell what we're thinking,

85
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:07,872
we have to prove that we thought about the thing. So for example, in Overboard,

86
00:05:07,912 --> 00:05:10,433
which I think is a detective game as well by this metric,

87
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,722
in the morning on your very first playthrough of the game, the player is strongly encouraged to go

88
00:05:16,762 --> 00:05:20,304
to breakfast and act normal because they're trying to pretend like they don't know that

89
00:05:20,324 --> 00:05:26,766
their husband has been murdered. That's not a very standard detective game

90
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:32,251
prompt but most players will do it because it's the tutorial and they want to see what the game

91
00:05:32,311 --> 00:05:37,193
is supposed to be about and if they do go to the restaurant and have breakfast they'll bump into

92
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:41,575
another character who will engage them in idle conversation and will remark that you are only

93
00:05:41,635 --> 00:05:44,817
wearing one earring that your protagonist is only wearing one earring.

94
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:51,952
This is a thing. It's a clue. We've discovered a clue. But it doesn't tell us what to do. Then

95
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:55,994
we have to think about it. And the game prompts you quite heavily, because this is the opening.

96
00:05:56,034 --> 00:06:00,957
But still, our deduction is it might be on the upper deck, which is where the murder happened,

97
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:05,720
right? We might have lost this earring during the murder. And our action to prove that we

98
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,241
thought about it is to go to the upper deck and check.

99
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:13,092
It's very straightforward, it's very simple, but it fits this loop of finding a thing,

100
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:16,558
thinking about the thing and then demonstrating to the game somehow that you've done it.

101
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:19,704
So there is this hand over hand process.

102
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:24,926
between the game and the player, with each one doing a little bit of work on their turn

103
00:06:25,106 --> 00:06:27,788
to push the game forward, to push the story forward.

104
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:34,113
So the game will give us a piece of explicit, detailed information, not your detective quality

105
00:06:34,153 --> 00:06:38,717
is increased by one and not you've gained seven police points, but rather there was

106
00:06:38,737 --> 00:06:43,921
someone in the library at 8.15 with a knife, something really specific and concrete.

107
00:06:44,521 --> 00:06:48,185
and then we, the player, have to think about that and express back to the game,

108
00:06:48,645 --> 00:06:50,607
I understand, I understand what you're trying to tell me.

109
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:56,513
So the game unlocks some information and then the player in return takes some kind of action.

110
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,689
So the part where the player shows the game

111
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:01,949
that they've understood,

112
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:04,349
that's obviously the most interesting part

113
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:05,230
for designers, right?

114
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,710
That's essentially, basically takes the form

115
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,951
of a combination lock, right?

116
00:07:10,571 --> 00:07:12,031
It requires the player to take some action

117
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:14,332
that isn't explicitly detailed to them,

118
00:07:15,192 --> 00:07:16,932
which acts like a combination lock

119
00:07:17,192 --> 00:07:19,533
to express to the game that they understood what's going on.

120
00:07:19,813 --> 00:07:22,293
So that might be simply go to this location

121
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:24,754
as soon as possible, or go to this room

122
00:07:24,854 --> 00:07:27,495
between the hours of 10 and 11, that kind of thing.

123
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:34,336
It's not difficult necessarily, but there isn't a button for it, and there isn't a quest log telling you to do it,

124
00:07:34,396 --> 00:07:36,316
and there isn't a UI marker telling you to do it.

125
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:41,518
And while it is hopefully fairly obviously the correct answer, the correct action to take,

126
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:46,399
what the game actually does is give you a map screen and say, prove what you know.

127
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:52,680
And then as the game continues, those demands of proof become stronger and stricter and tighter and more specific,

128
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,440
assuming that the game gets harder as it goes.

129
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:58,535
Now, I don't know if you're going to like that definition of what a detective game is,

130
00:07:58,575 --> 00:07:59,495
but I'm going to run with it for now.

131
00:07:59,735 --> 00:08:05,519
But I think it's worth noting that a few games that are commonly thought of as detective games don't fit.

132
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:09,121
So I don't think The Witcher 3 fits this definition particularly.

133
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:13,803
It tells a detective like story at many occasions, but they're very linear.

134
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:19,126
They're very guided. And the player is never sought to prove that they know what's going on.

135
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:22,568
They're more asked to react to what they think about what has happened.

136
00:08:23,685 --> 00:08:28,309
I'm not sure this definition covers a game like L.A. Noire either, because if I remember that game correctly,

137
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:43,584
again, you're always doing what you're told. And while it does branch, it branches more on your ability to punch people and drive your car than it is on whether or not you understood the point of the crime, however much their interrogation mechanic hopes to be that.

138
00:08:44,685 --> 00:08:51,191
So I think what I want to be clear about is I'm really trying to cover games that require the player to do detective work,

139
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:58,898
not necessarily games about detectives, which is obviously to say that we're really talking about games which have detective like verbs.

140
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:04,423
Right. Because the interesting bit is the expression part. It's the part where the player tells the game, yeah, I get it.

141
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:09,148
I know what's going on. Give me more. And detective games.

142
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:16,926
live or die on the basis of this, right? That's fairly obvious. I mean, if the player has an idea

143
00:09:16,966 --> 00:09:20,028
about the game, but they can't express it because they haven't got the verbs for it,

144
00:09:20,088 --> 00:09:24,550
then the game cannot be played. And equally, if the player has absolutely no clue what's going

145
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:30,253
on in this story whatsoever, but is able to express the correct next step anyway, then the game is

146
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:35,296
linear or led by the nose or throwaway. I don't know. It might still be fun and engaging,

147
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:38,417
but the player doesn't actually have to pay any attention in order to complete it.

148
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:43,200
And I think if you've played any detective games, we don't need to break anybody over the coals.

149
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,862
We've definitely all played examples that fit into both of those extremes.

150
00:09:47,142 --> 00:09:48,402
It's fair enough. It's a hard problem.

151
00:09:52,774 --> 00:10:02,587
The slightly more approach then is to start thinking about those detail. Obviously, the more expressive verbs we allow, the more interesting deductions the game can allow.

152
00:10:03,849 --> 00:10:08,375
Fair enough. OK, no, look, I didn't fly halfway around the world to tell a bunch of narrative designers to think about their verbs.

153
00:10:08,435 --> 00:10:10,197
I mean, I quite literally did not do that.

154
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:15,020
but I do think it's worth reviewing some of the really excellent detective games that we all like,

155
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,963
that we've all played and everybody knows, and just have a little look at their verbs before we

156
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:22,386
proceed. So I picked on three, all of which have won bajillions of awards and everybody likes them,

157
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:28,310
so no one can accuse me of criticising anybody because we're not here to do that. So if you look

158
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:33,854
at Her Story, classic detective game, probably the best detective game we have in the detective oeuvre.

159
00:10:34,414 --> 00:10:36,475
oeuvre? oeuvre, isn't that? Anyway.

160
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,240
But the verb is very strange.

161
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,322
It's this database search mechanic, right,

162
00:10:42,362 --> 00:10:43,242
that brings up videos.

163
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:46,264
And it doesn't necessarily transplant very well

164
00:10:46,484 --> 00:10:48,806
outside of her story itself.

165
00:10:49,386 --> 00:10:50,827
So you can't really imagine putting that

166
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:52,048
into an Agatha Christie story.

167
00:10:52,088 --> 00:10:55,530
I mean, you could perhaps make an epistolar,

168
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,171
one of those letter writing stories anyway,

169
00:10:58,552 --> 00:11:01,533
where you find a letter by typing in a word from letters,

170
00:11:01,593 --> 00:11:03,935
but I'm not really sure that's a good idea necessarily.

171
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:05,796
And anyway, Sambalo likes video too much,

172
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:06,496
so it will never happen.

173
00:11:07,277 --> 00:11:12,380
Obra Dinn is obviously a very excellent detective game, but its combination of verbs being a magic

174
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:18,224
self-writing book and a time rewind moment of death magic pocket watch is so frankly bizarre

175
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:22,586
it's amazing that he got away with it in the first place. And it's unlikely to spawn an

176
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:25,728
entire genre of detective games that follow the same model.

177
00:11:27,822 --> 00:11:32,664
Which is kind of odd, really, because mysteries are like one of the biggest genres that there are in fiction,

178
00:11:32,824 --> 00:11:36,386
and there were a billion episodes of Columbo and a billion episodes of Quincy.

179
00:11:36,426 --> 00:11:39,407
There's definitely something repeatable in the concept of a mystery.

180
00:11:39,487 --> 00:11:43,729
But Obradin's particular take on it, I think, is specific to Obradin.

181
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,771
I may be wrong, but it seems that way to me. And then finally.

182
00:11:49,888 --> 00:12:01,302
Outer Wilds, which I would argue by our definition is a detective game, is probably actually the best example that we've got of a game that doesn't use strange verbs to achieve its...

183
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:08,109
It's combination locks, right? It relies on location and timing for almost all of them,

184
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:12,611
and then mixes in a lot of the elements of its verb set, but its verb set is fairly ordinary.

185
00:12:12,651 --> 00:12:16,613
It's not that unusual, you know, it's light and jumping and thrusters and things like that.

186
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:20,215
It doesn't have a gun, which makes it quite unusual in some ways as a computer game,

187
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:21,555
but less so than that used to be.

188
00:12:22,653 --> 00:12:27,455
But equally, while it's extremely successful at its detective deduction loop,

189
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:34,478
it is the game in this list that moves us the furthest from a classic notion of what a detective game is supposed to be.

190
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:40,141
Philip Marlowe never did nail a 30s pornographer by jumping into a tornado at the right moment.

191
00:12:43,182 --> 00:12:47,686
I want to be really clear before people go into tribal brain,

192
00:12:47,786 --> 00:12:50,268
because I'm talking about some games that you might like,

193
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,210
I'm not criticizing anything.

194
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,351
This is not a criticism.

195
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:54,432
They all do.

196
00:12:54,992 --> 00:12:55,973
They are all excellent.

197
00:12:56,033 --> 00:12:58,755
And they do precisely what they set out to do.

198
00:12:58,956 --> 00:13:02,178
That's what makes them superb games.

199
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:03,279
But.

200
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:10,866
The point is if these games represent a model of not only what a detective game is but what it can

201
00:13:11,046 --> 00:13:15,170
be we have to ask the question have we missed anything? Is there anything which ought to be

202
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:21,076
included that somehow isn't included? In fact is there a large chunk of the art of mystery

203
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:26,761
storytelling which hasn't been addressed as far as I can tell in these titles at all? Well

204
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:33,432
I think maybe there is, because so far we've only really been talking about the short term

205
00:13:33,552 --> 00:13:33,974
game loop.

206
00:13:35,611 --> 00:13:37,892
discovery, clue, discovery, clue, discovery.

207
00:13:38,572 --> 00:13:40,053
And slowly over the course of that,

208
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,254
we piece together the backstory of the game, right?

209
00:13:42,274 --> 00:13:43,214
That's how her story works,

210
00:13:43,274 --> 00:13:44,795
is you assemble your understanding of the narrative.

211
00:13:44,835 --> 00:13:45,775
That's how Outer Wilds works,

212
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:47,556
is you assemble your understanding of the narrative.

213
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:50,817
Because these games have a secret history,

214
00:13:51,217 --> 00:13:53,178
which you, the detective, are uncovering

215
00:13:53,418 --> 00:13:54,859
as you play and piecing together.

216
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,480
But every time you encounter a bit of that narrative,

217
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,021
it's generally a piece of truth,

218
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:01,822
and you put it together into a truth jigsaw.

219
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:02,922
And by the end of it, you have...

220
00:14:03,757 --> 00:14:05,037
the complete truth of the game.

221
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:07,219
And you can understand the story and you can stop,

222
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:10,420
unless it's her story, in which case you don't necessarily understand the story anyway,

223
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,761
but that's okay, it fits the genre.

224
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:18,665
I mean, we've all heard Obra Dinn described as narrative Sudoku, okay?

225
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,626
But the thing about Sudoku is that when you're doing a Sudoku,

226
00:14:21,646 --> 00:14:24,808
there's that end bit, which this is a picture of the end bit of a Sudoku,

227
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:26,709
where you're really just putting numbers in.

228
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:28,470
You're not actually doing anything.

229
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:35,075
you totally could just stop at that point because like in any meaningful sense the sudoku puzzle

230
00:14:35,556 --> 00:14:40,460
is over it's it's finished it's been done it's complete already and the only reason that we

231
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,023
don't leave a sudoku puzzle in this state is because it's kind of nicer when it's been tidied

232
00:14:45,123 --> 00:14:50,808
up um but that's not really how narratives are supposed to end we're not supposed to end narrative

233
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:51,529
experiences

234
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:59,514
with a process of tidying up particularly. Narratives are supposed to surprise and delight.

235
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:05,857
Detective stories are supposed to have a big twist at the end, a big moment of revelation that clears

236
00:15:05,897 --> 00:15:10,420
away the confusion that came before, a moment where the light is suddenly shone. I mean you've

237
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,023
never finished a Sudoku puzzle and finally put in that last number and thought, oh it was a five

238
00:15:15,063 --> 00:15:17,664
all along, of course I knew it, that changes everything.

239
00:15:19,388 --> 00:15:21,710
Sudoku will never generate that experience.

240
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,572
It cannot generate that experience

241
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:26,596
because it's fundamentally built not like that, right?

242
00:15:26,696 --> 00:15:28,157
So what am I talking about?

243
00:15:28,197 --> 00:15:29,739
I'm talking about the solve.

244
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:30,680
We need the solve.

245
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,681
Perhaps we need the solve.

246
00:15:31,781 --> 00:15:33,303
Anyway, we seem to be missing the solve.

247
00:15:35,058 --> 00:15:38,542
The master solution to the complex crime,

248
00:15:38,902 --> 00:15:42,746
the final pulling together of disparate elements

249
00:15:42,826 --> 00:15:46,109
to create something unexpected but ultimately completely

250
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:46,690
sensible.

251
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:51,595
Hercule Poirot does not solve a succession of small mysteries

252
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:54,037
over the course of his one and a half hour TV

253
00:15:54,097 --> 00:15:55,319
movie from the 80s or his 200 page novel.

254
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:59,583
with a hand the full narrative to him.

255
00:15:59,823 --> 00:16:00,943
That's not how he works.

256
00:16:00,983 --> 00:16:03,144
His process, which is a lot more dramatic,

257
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:06,845
is that he brings together all the confusing and separate

258
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:10,246
elements of the crime in a sunburst of solution

259
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:13,066
that wows everybody, that floors everybody in the room.

260
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:17,507
But as soon as he does it, we go, ah, we should have known.

261
00:16:17,628 --> 00:16:18,488
We should have known.

262
00:16:20,202 --> 00:16:21,282
So that's what I'm interested in.

263
00:16:21,342 --> 00:16:24,083
That's what I want to talk about today is how do we move away

264
00:16:24,203 --> 00:16:28,784
from this idea of the basic deductive game loop of the detective game

265
00:16:28,824 --> 00:16:32,385
to something that allows us these moments of blinding revelation

266
00:16:32,805 --> 00:16:34,746
that can climax a story for us?

267
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,406
Can it can it be done? Can it be done?

268
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:38,086
And of course, people have tried to do this, right?

269
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:41,087
It's an obvious part of the murder mystery genre.

270
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:43,287
It's classic. It's very, very classic.

271
00:16:44,248 --> 00:16:47,969
And one of the mechanics that's often used is the the fact

272
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,709
linking deduction mechanic, right?

273
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:54,071
The fact one plus fact two gives us exciting new fact three.

274
00:16:55,712 --> 00:17:01,995
Now, I want to talk about this mechanic specifically for a while, which...

275
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:07,140
perhaps seems a bit unfair because it's just one mechanic amongst many,

276
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:11,283
but I think it's got some really interesting flaws

277
00:17:11,523 --> 00:17:15,846
that are really helpful to think about sort of quite clearly.

278
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,709
The first thing I want to say is that it's been tried by a lot of games.

279
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:21,670
There's a lot of games that use this kind of mechanic.

280
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,231
Some of them are more successful than others.

281
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:26,754
And it's a pretty natural design to try, right?

282
00:17:26,894 --> 00:17:29,796
Logical deduction is A plus B implies C.

283
00:17:29,896 --> 00:17:30,016
So...

284
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:32,859
That's pretty reasonable to think that this will work very well.

285
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:38,845
And moreover, it comes directly from the detective game core loop.

286
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:46,953
We have a fact. We take a combination lock style action of applying these two things that don't immediately appear connected together,

287
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:50,257
demonstrating our understanding and the game unlock something for us.

288
00:17:50,297 --> 00:17:52,700
So it's a natural part of that game loop.

289
00:17:53,737 --> 00:18:00,701
But as I say, I think that the idea has some flaws which expose some flaws in our wider thinking about detective games, perhaps.

290
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:05,924
Firstly, some fairly simple things. You actually have to have fact one and fact two.

291
00:18:06,024 --> 00:18:11,807
I don't just mean you have to have played the game enough to find them, but they also have to be things that you can pick up and put in your UI screen.

292
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:25,755
So in a good detective story, the detective is frequently making deductions based on things like their understanding of human nature or the unspoken rules of social etiquette and not just the cigar butt found in the fireplace.

293
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:33,418
It's a mixture of those two. Often a detective will go looking for additional weird information on the basis of some kind of.

294
00:18:34,721 --> 00:18:39,863
they've had which gets accumulated into their fact pile. In Christie's The Mysterious Affair

295
00:18:39,903 --> 00:18:44,424
at Stiles, Poirot baffles his associate Hastings by asking, by saying the most significant fact

296
00:18:44,464 --> 00:18:48,165
in the crime is that the temperature was 80 degrees in the shade the night before.

297
00:18:48,765 --> 00:18:54,027
Hastings is completely perplexed but it does improve indeed to be the clincher of the crime,

298
00:18:54,087 --> 00:19:00,489
it's obvious in retrospect. The problem then is not one of finding the answer, it's really one of

299
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:03,890
asking the right question. But if you're doing a deduction linking game...

300
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,452
your facts have to be up there in a way the player can access directly.

301
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:13,955
You have to have the temperature on the night of April 15th written in a little box on the screen.

302
00:19:13,995 --> 00:19:17,556
You have to have, I don't know, ladies button their jackets right over left.

303
00:19:18,017 --> 00:19:22,379
And when you start to do that, it's a bit like when my son is eating an apple in the park

304
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:26,220
and decides he wants to play I Spy for something beginning with an A.

305
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:31,563
Secondly, the conclusion might not be that exciting.

306
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,426
it's quite common to be playing one of these stories and be a little bit ahead of the narrative and think,

307
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:37,608
oh, well, obviously this.

308
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:43,138
and then wonder how you're supposed to tell the game this thing you already know.

309
00:19:43,278 --> 00:19:47,559
What weird and confusing process do I have to go through to explain something that's obvious to me?

310
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:52,260
It's a very, very hard problem to avoid because of course people are differently versed in detective

311
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,861
stories. Some things jump out, some things don't. It's deeply annoying both for the designer and

312
00:19:56,941 --> 00:20:02,063
the player. It's a real problem because of this combination lock gate that the player has to get

313
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,504
But then again, what if the conclusion isn't obvious?

314
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,361
What if it isn't immediately apparent?

315
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:11,923
Then suddenly the fact that you've got all the facts

316
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:13,704
of the case laid out in front of you,

317
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:15,325
ready to be quickly linked together,

318
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:17,326
scales up the possibilities in a way

319
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:19,068
that isn't necessarily very fun.

320
00:20:19,488 --> 00:20:22,510
If there's no curation, then it can get very quick.

321
00:20:23,411 --> 00:20:26,992
overwhelming, even if the answer that you're looking for is completely fair and completely

322
00:20:27,032 --> 00:20:32,275
logical, and even if you understand the plot. That's a really crucial point, I think, actually.

323
00:20:32,635 --> 00:20:36,216
I wanted to give you an example, which is this. This is from a book called Where's the

324
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:41,199
Pair by Britta Teckendrup, and it's a book that my children have. It's a book for toddlers,

325
00:20:41,719 --> 00:20:45,261
and it's surprisingly difficult. It's full of pages like this, which have a big picture,

326
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:49,323
and you're supposed to spot the two matching fish.

327
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:53,405
Now, if I could see you properly, you're a very tiny window on my computer screen.

328
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:56,427
I would ask you to raise your hands when you see the pair.

329
00:20:57,287 --> 00:21:00,289
As it is, I'm going to wait for a bit, and I'm going to show you the answer.

330
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:02,630
But perhaps you saw it immediately.

331
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,871
Perhaps you already know exactly what it is.

332
00:21:05,812 --> 00:21:06,853
Or perhaps you're still looking.

333
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:09,074
But I think we can agree on a couple of things.

334
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:11,695
We can agree that as a problem, it's entirely fair.

335
00:21:12,216 --> 00:21:18,980
And the answer really should be completely, totally obvious.

336
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,151
I mean, the answer is the two fish the other way.

337
00:21:22,711 --> 00:21:24,332
This should jump straight out to us.

338
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:26,332
But I don't think it does.

339
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:29,173
I find these pages of this book extremely difficult.

340
00:21:29,213 --> 00:21:30,354
I don't know whether you did or not.

341
00:21:31,034 --> 00:21:34,275
And I think that's because cross-referencing is hard,

342
00:21:34,555 --> 00:21:38,456
even if the rules for your cross-referencing are actually very simple.

343
00:21:38,976 --> 00:21:43,237
If the rules for what constitutes a match are actually a little bit obscure or opaque,

344
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:47,198
then you end up with something that the player is going to attack by brute force out of sheer

345
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:51,119
desperation, and we can't really fault them for that. The overwhelm problem is real.

346
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:55,940
Now, I don't want to make it seem like I'm sitting here in my armchair, literally,

347
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,921
criticizing a design that I've never tried. That would be a bit unfair. So I would like to add as

348
00:21:59,941 --> 00:22:05,782
well that at Inkle, we built around 20 or 30 deduction-based prototypes in the course of

349
00:22:05,802 --> 00:22:06,802
the last two or three years.

350
00:22:07,582 --> 00:22:11,824
and found, well we found even more problems and here are the other problems we found.

351
00:22:12,324 --> 00:22:16,426
Firstly it's cluttered, there's an enormous amount of information on screen but relative to it there's

352
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:20,807
not actually that much for the player to do. It's a bit like the fish all had name labels

353
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:24,689
and blurbs and a tooltip and you had to read all of them before you could see the structure.

354
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:29,230
and sometimes you have to read them twice or three times and check back at them just to see what they said

355
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:34,172
because you can't remember because there's so much text, all to click to matching things.

356
00:22:34,392 --> 00:22:38,773
The clutter gets worse as the game goes on rather than better because every time you

357
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:42,274
make a deduction it makes another bloody fact and puts it in your fact list.

358
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,356
unless the new facts somehow wipe out the old ones.

359
00:22:45,436 --> 00:22:48,159
But what if the old facts have multiple consequences?

360
00:22:48,239 --> 00:22:49,299
Truth isn't tidy.

361
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,961
Things don't imply one thing.

362
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:52,022
They imply lots of things.

363
00:22:52,442 --> 00:22:54,103
In fact, truth is a real, a real git

364
00:22:54,504 --> 00:22:57,266
because it's inherently broad, not narrow.

365
00:22:57,326 --> 00:23:00,589
I mean, the thing about truth is that it's true.

366
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:09,117
there is never only one way to arrive at a truth or to deduce any fact, because truth abides,

367
00:23:09,357 --> 00:23:15,403
if you like. So while you can make a deduction game which allows you, I suppose, to arrive at

368
00:23:15,423 --> 00:23:19,187
truth in multiple ways, so that would get around that problem, but then you're putting even more

369
00:23:19,227 --> 00:23:22,750
facts on screen, some of which the player isn't going to use or is going to wonder why it's there

370
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,893
because they got it over here in this other obvious way.

371
00:23:25,453 --> 00:23:30,739
And lastly, and this is very significant to me, it's hard to write. I mean, where does one fact

372
00:23:30,999 --> 00:23:37,726
end and another one begin? Is the fact Elsa is lying different from the fact Elsa is lying to

373
00:23:37,766 --> 00:23:43,572
protect Anna? Or is one a deduction from the other? Or is Anna knows Elsa is lying different

374
00:23:43,612 --> 00:23:47,336
from Elsa is lying or from Elsa is covering that Anna or...

375
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:53,395
How do we know how best to chop our facts into tiny little atomic pieces?

376
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:57,496
We're sort of guessing, but it gets very complex and muddy quite quickly.

377
00:23:57,837 --> 00:24:01,638
To all of this, Poirot says, no, and I agree with him.

378
00:24:01,778 --> 00:24:02,558
It is too much.

379
00:24:03,018 --> 00:24:05,679
So I think we need to look at the big solve concept from scratch.

380
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:09,820
I think we need to take a step back and try and think from the beginning.

381
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,640
What is it we actually want to achieve?

382
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:16,292
keen in this climactic scene if we're going to really enjoy ourselves with some detective

383
00:24:16,512 --> 00:24:22,397
solving loveliness. So goals, great goals. What are our goals? Right, I want to be able to combine

384
00:24:22,457 --> 00:24:26,500
facts from the game. I want clues, I want discoveries, and I want to be able to combine

385
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,883
them with ideas from the real world, with things that I know or intuitively believe.

386
00:24:31,324 --> 00:24:36,508
I want a curated input system so that I'm not overwhelmed at any point. I want just a few fish,

387
00:24:36,588 --> 00:24:38,329
not quite so many fish, thank you very much.

388
00:24:39,242 --> 00:24:43,944
I want to have some kind of input that makes it easy to express ideas.

389
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:46,045
I don't want it to be too abstract or weird.

390
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:49,086
I don't want to be drawing funny diagrams to try and explain something

391
00:24:49,106 --> 00:24:53,148
which doesn't naturally fit that particular presentation model.

392
00:24:55,008 --> 00:24:57,329
And finally, I want it to be balanced, I guess.

393
00:24:57,389 --> 00:25:02,971
I want it to be, you know, feel like it's it's got a space for play in it

394
00:25:03,332 --> 00:25:06,413
so that it doesn't highlight the correct answers, but it doesn't hide them away

395
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:06,653
either.

396
00:25:10,499 --> 00:25:16,868
So what we really want, I think, is we want to turn the detective game mechanic entirely upside down.

397
00:25:17,815 --> 00:25:22,598
And instead of hunting through a whole possibility space to find the golden path of truth,

398
00:25:22,658 --> 00:25:25,160
the one true meaning that will lead us to the end of the game.

399
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:30,283
What I want to be doing is I want to be building up a truth a few pieces at a time,

400
00:25:30,784 --> 00:25:37,468
ideally with each piece going in and being examined and tested for its suitability and considered before the next one is applied.

401
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:43,232
I want to move away from the paradigm of the combination lock.

402
00:25:45,545 --> 00:25:48,946
Towards something that's a lot more like solving a maze.

403
00:25:50,327 --> 00:25:52,167
So in a maze, you have dead ends,

404
00:25:52,227 --> 00:25:53,487
but you can walk back from them.

405
00:25:54,288 --> 00:25:56,148
There doesn't need to be a single path through a maze.

406
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:58,349
You can do it quickly or slowly.

407
00:25:58,389 --> 00:25:59,349
It doesn't actually matter.

408
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:01,750
There might be multiple exit points in this maze.

409
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,430
You're just forming a path.

410
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,350
There are rules.

411
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,771
You're not allowed to jump over the walls,

412
00:26:06,151 --> 00:26:08,091
but there's not many more rules than that.

413
00:26:08,812 --> 00:26:13,653
In short, you're constructing an argument, and there is no one right argument for anything,

414
00:26:14,594 --> 00:26:18,515
even something which is entirely self-evident, like that the Russian military action in Ukraine

415
00:26:18,575 --> 00:26:22,497
is a crime against humanity. There are multiple ways to prove that idea. There are multiple

416
00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:26,138
approaches to make that convincing. There is no one way because it's truth, and truth can be

417
00:26:26,178 --> 00:26:30,260
approached from any angle you like. So all we really want to be able to do is make a case that's

418
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,242
compelling and that's watertight and covers the available facts.

419
00:26:35,265 --> 00:26:41,210
We want to step away from this idea that the player is the master detective in control of everything, totally in charge,

420
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:47,234
because that's not actually that fun. Holmes is not really having that much fun when he just knows the answers.

421
00:26:47,454 --> 00:26:52,278
It's a bit like sitting down to do your Sudoku and being able to see all the numbers in the grid before you've actually done any thinking.

422
00:26:52,318 --> 00:26:53,459
It's pointless at that stage.

423
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:56,040
I was glib earlier when my slide suggested

424
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,940
that Sudoku was pointless.

425
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,900
Obviously it's the process of deduction that's fun,

426
00:26:59,261 --> 00:27:01,261
but Holmes doesn't get to do that really,

427
00:27:01,281 --> 00:27:02,181
because he just knows,

428
00:27:02,201 --> 00:27:04,002
because otherwise he's not magical Holmes.

429
00:27:04,542 --> 00:27:06,842
So really we want the player to be Watson rather than Holmes,

430
00:27:07,603 --> 00:27:10,223
feeding ideas to his friend,

431
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:13,024
which his friend will accept or refute.

432
00:27:13,364 --> 00:27:15,925
Doesn't necessarily mean that you need multiple characters.

433
00:27:16,025 --> 00:27:17,345
One protagonist could be going through it

434
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,165
in their own minds.

435
00:27:18,645 --> 00:27:20,466
Poirot is constantly muttering to himself.

436
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:22,587
So perhaps he's playing the game that we haven't yet made.

437
00:27:23,987 --> 00:27:29,631
And also I think if you think about the design in this way, you start to see opportunities for balancing.

438
00:27:29,651 --> 00:27:36,875
A combination lock cannot be balanced. You either know the answer or you don't. It's like a quiz. It's inherently not fun.

439
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:42,170
But an argument that's built by playing a game can be balanced.

440
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,690
There can be multiple routes.

441
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,591
The player can redo sections.

442
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:49,051
The player can be encouraged to improve a semi-coherent idea

443
00:27:49,432 --> 00:27:50,852
into a fully coherent idea.

444
00:27:52,152 --> 00:27:54,313
If you are talking to another person, how helpful are they?

445
00:27:54,613 --> 00:27:55,833
Do they suggest alternatives?

446
00:27:55,873 --> 00:27:57,874
Do they point out contradictions early or late,

447
00:27:57,954 --> 00:27:59,074
or specifically or generally?

448
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,375
There's lots of wiggle room for creating a space which is fun.

449
00:28:02,395 --> 00:28:05,156
Of course, the problem with all of this, it's very nice.

450
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:05,876
It sounds great.

451
00:28:06,745 --> 00:28:08,806
The problem is verbs.

452
00:28:09,107 --> 00:28:12,369
Again, we need to somehow present the player with a method of actually doing this,

453
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,192
which means UI, which is extremely annoying to build.

454
00:28:16,252 --> 00:28:17,773
And no one at Inkle likes building UI.

455
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:21,076
I like to think we're good at it, but I'm not sure that we necessarily enjoy it.

456
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:24,698
Unless, unless.

457
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,000
For Overboard.

458
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,980
we weren't thinking about any of this, we were just trying to make the game as quickly as possible

459
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,425
and we wanted to replicate the Agatha Christie structure as best as we could, as closely as we

460
00:28:37,445 --> 00:28:41,929
could. So we knew we wanted a few hours of in-game exploring and talking to people and mucking about

461
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:46,713
followed by the detective gathering everyone together in the room and going through the

462
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:52,037
crime step by step because that's what she does, so that's what we wanted to do. But our insight and

463
00:28:54,113 --> 00:28:55,794
we had it sort of halfway through building the game,

464
00:28:56,214 --> 00:28:58,656
was that the detective in the room scene

465
00:28:58,796 --> 00:29:01,197
that Christie likes so much is the process

466
00:29:01,257 --> 00:29:04,819
by which the author explains the story to the reader.

467
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,141
So we thought, well, if an author can explain

468
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:08,401
their deductions to the reader

469
00:29:08,742 --> 00:29:10,323
via one of these climactic scenes,

470
00:29:10,723 --> 00:29:12,984
maybe that can also be how the player

471
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,145
explains their deduction to the game.

472
00:29:15,806 --> 00:29:16,526
So let's steal it.

473
00:29:17,027 --> 00:29:17,627
So we stole it.

474
00:29:18,328 --> 00:29:24,284
which led us to implement our big solve scene using the same buttons that we had in the game anyway.

475
00:29:24,755 --> 00:29:26,135
Basically, conversation.

476
00:29:27,215 --> 00:29:29,036
We've tried this before, actually, I should say,

477
00:29:29,116 --> 00:29:29,936
on a smaller scale.

478
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:31,597
There's a murder mystery in 80 days

479
00:29:31,797 --> 00:29:32,757
if you've played that game.

480
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,178
But it's a particularly ruthless implementation there.

481
00:29:36,278 --> 00:29:37,879
It's got a very narrow golden path

482
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:39,279
if you've got the right idea.

483
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:41,580
There are traps on all the other options if you haven't.

484
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,401
And if you've got half a picture of events,

485
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:45,441
then it's kind of luck as to whether you

486
00:29:45,461 --> 00:29:47,022
pick the right path through the conversation

487
00:29:47,482 --> 00:29:48,302
or you pick the wrong one.

488
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:58,069
And of course, you need to have collected the right information over the course of the story up to this point to even have the correct answers available.

489
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:06,718
So it's extremely easy for this sequence to feel extremely unreasonable, even though there are a few multiple routes through the conversation.

490
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,140
So for Overboard.

491
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:10,137
We needed to do better than that.

492
00:30:10,497 --> 00:30:14,359
I mean, the whole game rests on the final conclusion scene

493
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:17,941
feeling intelligent and responsive and above all, fair, right?

494
00:30:17,961 --> 00:30:20,342
If it doesn't feel fair, the game is impossible to play.

495
00:30:20,982 --> 00:30:25,825
And because Overboard is a game about being a murderer, not catching one,

496
00:30:26,445 --> 00:30:29,667
the protagonist spends most of her game time, majority of the game,

497
00:30:30,047 --> 00:30:31,968
either destroying evidence or falsifying it,

498
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:34,970
or entirely murdering other people.

499
00:30:35,464 --> 00:30:51,460
So the golden path model doesn't really work for the conclusion anyway, because it might rely on a character saying something who's actually at the bottom of the ocean or having a piece of evidence which you can't have or the non-existence of a completely fake piece of evidence that Veronica has managed to bring into existence.

500
00:30:52,421 --> 00:30:53,982
So that presented us with quite a challenge.

501
00:30:54,082 --> 00:30:55,883
How do we have this big solve moment that we want,

502
00:30:56,523 --> 00:31:00,926
given that we have a very, very flexible input state to that final scene?

503
00:31:01,546 --> 00:31:06,389
What we really needed to do was create an AI system that would deliver a conclusion

504
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:09,431
based on evidence and the people available to it in a logical order,

505
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:14,193
presenting it rationally to the player while giving lots of opportunity for...

506
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:19,060
for the player to kick and affect that storyline as it was being developed. So effectively we're

507
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,706
now saying on our super fast projects that we want to get shipped this week please, we want

508
00:31:23,746 --> 00:31:27,691
to build an AI Hercule Poirot who will examine all the evidence and formulate a conclusion.

509
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,174
OK, so we gave it a try.

510
00:31:31,354 --> 00:31:32,795
Let's break down Overboard a little bit more.

511
00:31:33,055 --> 00:31:35,396
What actually happens in Overboard are two phases.

512
00:31:36,017 --> 00:31:39,218
There's a high agency, low impact phase,

513
00:31:39,258 --> 00:31:41,500
where the player is making evidence and lying to people

514
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,801
and setting up the parameters of the accusation scene.

515
00:31:44,061 --> 00:31:44,821
They get a lot of freedom.

516
00:31:44,841 --> 00:31:45,782
They can do a lot of things.

517
00:31:46,162 --> 00:31:48,243
But the individual actions don't have very many consequences

518
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:48,743
there and then.

519
00:31:49,893 --> 00:31:52,655
then at some point, the hammer falls, the accusation begins.

520
00:31:53,356 --> 00:31:56,658
At that point, the player then can argue and lie

521
00:31:56,718 --> 00:31:58,259
to tilt the accusation scene,

522
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,101
but they don't have much agency anymore.

523
00:32:00,301 --> 00:32:02,062
All the initial parameters have been set.

524
00:32:02,102 --> 00:32:05,605
They're now just trying to adjust things and tweak things.

525
00:32:06,165 --> 00:32:08,587
But those tweaks might have a very high impact

526
00:32:08,767 --> 00:32:10,048
because everything matters now.

527
00:32:10,448 --> 00:32:12,510
If you can just nudge a conversation away

528
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:14,111
from being something incriminating,

529
00:32:14,251 --> 00:32:15,652
then that's a clear win.

530
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:16,633
That makes a difference.

531
00:32:16,693 --> 00:32:17,913
It's not a delayed consequence.

532
00:32:18,014 --> 00:32:18,754
It's a consequence now.

533
00:32:19,428 --> 00:32:20,909
And then finally, an ending is created.

534
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,231
And one of the good things is, because we're not

535
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:27,813
interested at all in creating a puzzle or a single solution

536
00:32:27,953 --> 00:32:30,975
or a combination lock, we just want a coherent conclusion.

537
00:32:30,995 --> 00:32:34,157
There isn't even a proper murder story to be uncovered,

538
00:32:34,197 --> 00:32:35,257
so that's kind of nice.

539
00:32:36,358 --> 00:32:36,978
We're mostly.

540
00:32:38,182 --> 00:32:40,744
want to make sure that what the player is doing makes sense.

541
00:32:40,844 --> 00:32:44,006
It has to be interesting and the game has to respond intelligently.

542
00:32:44,447 --> 00:32:48,650
And ideally, we reward creative ideas and we punish banal ideas.

543
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:53,734
But we don't really need the game to be particularly clever or ingenious.

544
00:32:53,794 --> 00:32:56,095
So long as it's fun, it doesn't have to be hard.

545
00:32:56,874 --> 00:33:01,098
We don't have to make sure that the player can't accidentally brute force it or find a solution by accident.

546
00:33:01,498 --> 00:33:08,064
We don't want them to, but we don't have to go too hard on that because it's such a wide open parameter space.

547
00:33:09,645 --> 00:33:15,289
So the whole game rests on the implementation of this accusation scene, of this constructed argument.

548
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:19,492
So we approached that by building it in the most straightforward way that we possibly could,

549
00:33:20,173 --> 00:33:26,998
mainly so that it could grow barnacles and sidetracks and subcontent as we playtested it and developed the game.

550
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:29,560
We wanted a simple core so that it could get more complicated later.

551
00:33:31,032 --> 00:33:33,453
So we approach that in a top-down way.

552
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:37,274
This is kind of inspired by the weave syntax of ink.

553
00:33:37,555 --> 00:33:41,516
So it's a, I don't know if it's unique to ink anymore.

554
00:33:41,536 --> 00:33:43,137
I think yarn spinner has something similar,

555
00:33:43,157 --> 00:33:44,798
but the idea is it starts at the top

556
00:33:45,018 --> 00:33:46,459
and it drops through content

557
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:47,759
and it always reaches the bottom.

558
00:33:48,139 --> 00:33:49,460
And there might be choices and branching,

559
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,681
but it's guaranteed to hit that final beat.

560
00:33:52,601 --> 00:33:54,122
The idea there is we want to make sure

561
00:33:54,162 --> 00:33:56,623
that whatever happens, we definitely reach a conclusion.

562
00:33:58,351 --> 00:34:00,214
There are two ways that an interactive story can fail.

563
00:34:00,515 --> 00:34:02,077
One of them is it runs out of things to say,

564
00:34:02,217 --> 00:34:04,281
and the other is it doesn't make sense.

565
00:34:04,728 --> 00:34:06,929
And of those, the first one is a critical fail

566
00:34:06,989 --> 00:34:08,771
because then the game can't be played anymore.

567
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:10,972
And the second one isn't a critical fail

568
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:12,553
because it means some players will have

569
00:34:12,573 --> 00:34:14,134
a less good experience than other players.

570
00:34:14,274 --> 00:34:15,415
And that's normal in games.

571
00:34:16,115 --> 00:34:19,478
So we use this dropdown syntax that always hits the end.

572
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:23,320
And then we work on making it and optimizing it

573
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,162
so that it's as good as it can be for every playthrough

574
00:34:26,202 --> 00:34:27,643
that we can generate and we can make.

575
00:34:28,243 --> 00:34:29,464
We tune it, essentially.

576
00:34:30,305 --> 00:34:31,846
So into this top-down process,

577
00:34:32,166 --> 00:34:32,286
we...

578
00:34:33,543 --> 00:34:37,145
basically get the characters to talk one topic at a time.

579
00:34:37,746 --> 00:34:40,127
Topics are introduced in priority order.

580
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:42,128
They are whatever we say they are.

581
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:43,669
A topic has no formal definition.

582
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:46,651
So it could be a broad concept like Malcolm's gone missing,

583
00:34:46,932 --> 00:34:47,692
your husband's gone missing,

584
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:49,453
or it could be a specific detail

585
00:34:49,613 --> 00:34:51,314
like Veronica's earring was found

586
00:34:51,354 --> 00:34:52,655
on the upper deck at the crime scene.

587
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:56,501
We deal with really important topics first.

588
00:34:57,382 --> 00:35:00,645
Things like, somebody saw you killing someone.

589
00:35:00,705 --> 00:35:02,086
Well, okay, that's a straight game over.

590
00:35:02,326 --> 00:35:04,248
We want as little redundancy as possible

591
00:35:04,308 --> 00:35:04,929
in each playthrough.

592
00:35:04,969 --> 00:35:07,731
We don't want people going through an enormous scene

593
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:10,253
only to just find out they lost straight away.

594
00:35:11,334 --> 00:35:12,255
Fine, that's straightforward.

595
00:35:12,975 --> 00:35:20,280
So in a given topic, what we do is a very similar pattern for each one. It's introduced by some character.

596
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:27,405
That's not always the detective character. It might just be another character who discovered or learned something during the course of the day.

597
00:35:27,886 --> 00:35:29,267
It's then discussed by the group.

598
00:35:29,654 --> 00:35:34,297
which includes Veronica, the player, so you can affect that discussion, you can be very significant

599
00:35:34,317 --> 00:35:39,421
in that discussion, you can be called out for lying, you can be not called out for trying to

600
00:35:39,461 --> 00:35:43,043
adjust the truth, you can be the person everybody listens to, depending on your relationships with

601
00:35:43,083 --> 00:35:48,067
people. The conversation is pretty freeform, there's no need for hard rules here, but whatever

602
00:35:48,107 --> 00:35:52,429
happens, the drop-down idea again, we will eventually reach a conclusion and some kind

603
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:57,273
of outcome that's accepted by the whole group. It's considered now to be definitively true,

604
00:35:58,534 --> 00:35:59,178
this topic.

605
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:07,194
causes this conclusion here. And that conclusion will accumulate against somebody. It'll be some

606
00:36:07,254 --> 00:36:11,317
kind of evidence towards some kind of overall conclusion to the story. So, for example,

607
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:15,759
because that's quite nebulous, the topic of Malcolm is missing might result in some conversation

608
00:36:15,799 --> 00:36:19,781
where Veronica says, oh, he was with me last night, but the steward says that the bed wasn't

609
00:36:19,821 --> 00:36:25,164
slept in. So that means everybody concludes that Veronica is lying. And that's a black mark against

610
00:36:25,304 --> 00:36:29,606
Veronica. It goes in her ledger and it's one point against her.

611
00:36:31,645 --> 00:36:32,945
So that's, we do that for each topic.

612
00:36:33,005 --> 00:36:35,566
We kind of write them in compartmentalised ways,

613
00:36:35,866 --> 00:36:37,107
this topic, this topic, this topic.

614
00:36:37,167 --> 00:36:39,568
If we introduce a new piece of evidence or a new storyline,

615
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:41,589
we can just write a topic for it, for the conclusion,

616
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:42,849
bung it in the conclusion.

617
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,151
And then we stitch the pieces together.

618
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:48,812
Topics are introduced whenever it's sensible

619
00:36:48,912 --> 00:36:51,293
for them to be introduced.

620
00:36:54,416 --> 00:36:57,498
There is a spine, but if it makes sense,

621
00:36:57,758 --> 00:37:00,040
you saw this, well, I saw something like that,

622
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,541
then they'll jump in and say that.

623
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:04,303
So we can shuffle the topics around if we want to,

624
00:37:04,444 --> 00:37:05,564
if it makes better sense,

625
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:09,287
there's a tuning the story to be as good

626
00:37:09,347 --> 00:37:10,909
and as tight as we can make it.

627
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:16,393
There is a tiny bit of ink just to make sure

628
00:37:16,433 --> 00:37:18,654
that a topic isn't discussed more than once, obviously,

629
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:19,976
but that's really a minor detail.

630
00:37:20,957 --> 00:37:24,901
Topic discussions work really nicely, I think, for the replay of Overboard,

631
00:37:24,981 --> 00:37:27,624
because they teach the player what was relevant on your playthrough.

632
00:37:27,644 --> 00:37:31,107
They pick off details one by one and say, you might want to think about the earring.

633
00:37:31,127 --> 00:37:32,629
You might want to think about the sleepy draft.

634
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:33,690
You might want to think about this.

635
00:37:34,571 --> 00:37:35,652
So that's really good.

636
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:39,696
But another thing that comes out of it is that the system doesn't need to be rigid.

637
00:37:40,328 --> 00:37:46,050
And an outcome of one topic can always, if it wants to, re-contextualize a previous one.

638
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:53,192
So, you know, if we start talking about Clarissa and Malcolm having an affair, then Veronica might

639
00:37:53,252 --> 00:37:56,853
say, oh, I knew all about it and I felt terribly ashamed, I couldn't believe it, what am I supposed

640
00:37:56,893 --> 00:38:02,154
to do? And the outcome of that, if you pull it off, might be that, oh, Veronica was justified

641
00:38:02,474 --> 00:38:03,135
in her lying.

642
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:12,939
So we might take that previous outcome, which was a mark against her, and turn it into a mark against Clarissa by virtue of having this topic appear after the previous topic.

643
00:38:13,259 --> 00:38:19,341
So the order of topics can be significant if we want it to be, and the way the player plays them can be significant if we want it to be.

644
00:38:21,102 --> 00:38:21,442
Finally...

645
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:33,589
When we finally run out of topics to consider, or the evidence has got so overwhelmingly that you're definitely definitely guilty that the detective just says, yeah, okay, fine, we're done.

646
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:39,453
Then we pass it to our detective characters, an NPC who weighs up the outcomes.

647
00:38:41,354 --> 00:38:48,659
At this point, the player is no longer free to affect.

648
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:57,056
anything. They've essentially set out and now they're going. So, you know, this is fairly

649
00:38:57,096 --> 00:39:00,298
straightforward. We don't do anything particularly complicated because it has to work, right?

650
00:39:00,758 --> 00:39:05,322
So if Veronica has three guilty outcomes against her, Clarissa only has one, our detective character

651
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:09,905
will assert that Veronica is guilty, which leads us to an ending where she's arrested.

652
00:39:10,505 --> 00:39:12,927
The ending itself is window dress.

653
00:39:14,758 --> 00:39:19,140
with lots of content based on how the scene went.

654
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,882
So while internally Major Singh is simply saying

655
00:39:23,262 --> 00:39:25,884
Veronica has two more guilty points than Clarissa does,

656
00:39:26,224 --> 00:39:27,845
what he actually says might be,

657
00:39:28,205 --> 00:39:29,766
well, it seems to me that you were definitely

658
00:39:29,806 --> 00:39:31,687
on the upper deck and we all know that you hated Malcolm

659
00:39:31,707 --> 00:39:32,647
because he was having an affair

660
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:33,928
and we all know about the life insurance,

661
00:39:33,948 --> 00:39:35,368
therefore you're clearly the criminal.

662
00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:38,971
And that conclusion, that Poirot-style conclusion,

663
00:39:39,512 --> 00:39:41,633
is driven by whatever you set up in the game.

664
00:39:42,354 --> 00:39:44,015
So hopefully the way that plays out

665
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:46,017
is people bring in evidence,

666
00:39:46,037 --> 00:39:48,238
you try to struggle against it, you fail, you fail.

667
00:39:48,298 --> 00:39:49,239
Clarissa gets a little thing,

668
00:39:49,279 --> 00:39:50,780
you think you're gonna get an advantage there,

669
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,821
but that goes against you too.

670
00:39:51,861 --> 00:39:54,083
And at the end, the collective slams it and says,

671
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:55,904
nope, you're definitely guilty, and off you go to prison.

672
00:39:55,944 --> 00:39:57,405
And it feels dramatic and fluid.

673
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,167
And at the beginning of the scene,

674
00:39:59,387 --> 00:40:00,668
we don't know how it's gonna go.

675
00:40:00,688 --> 00:40:01,749
And in the middle of the scene,

676
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:03,790
we might start to get a sense of how it's going to go.

677
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,452
And by the end of the scene, it's completely fair enough how it went.

678
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:10,174
So hopefully we get a dramatic scene, which is entirely driven

679
00:40:10,234 --> 00:40:13,036
by the player's high agency actions during the main game loop,

680
00:40:13,476 --> 00:40:17,759
but that feels deductive and detective ish and full of content and context.

681
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:20,921
And with lots of opportunity for us to chip in with conversational ideas

682
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:24,824
or theories or counter theories or comments about what Clarissa

683
00:40:24,864 --> 00:40:26,205
might be like as a person.

684
00:40:26,585 --> 00:40:28,946
or whatever it is you think that might get you off the hook.

685
00:40:29,066 --> 00:40:31,647
And they will sometimes work if they make sense.

686
00:40:32,108 --> 00:40:35,069
So because it's not a formalized abstract system,

687
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:37,691
we can muck about with it basically and put in stuff that we like.

688
00:40:38,691 --> 00:40:44,814
Similarly, we might play a game in which we're so good at this that Veronica has no guilty outcomes and Clarissa has three guilty outcomes,

689
00:40:44,874 --> 00:40:50,017
in which case the detective will spin round and accuse Clarissa of the crime and nothing she says at that point will save her.

690
00:40:50,337 --> 00:40:52,338
And that's fine. And you can gloat all you like.

691
00:40:53,477 --> 00:41:03,001
And again, his dialogue will explain how the particular bits of evidence that were gathered during this playthrough show the incontrovertible truth that Clarissa is definitely guilty.

692
00:41:03,142 --> 00:41:06,843
And of course, that's dynamically constructed, but that's just a text generation problem.

693
00:41:07,003 --> 00:41:11,446
There's no actual design implications there. So we can black box that and again, just make it as good as we want.

694
00:41:12,106 --> 00:41:16,588
And because Overboard is a game about throwing someone off a boat, we have a nice fallback

695
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:20,390
position. You always need a fallback position, right? You need a way of dealing with sort of

696
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:25,592
meh outcomes where the player hasn't really done anything very exciting. And in our case, it's,

697
00:41:25,912 --> 00:41:29,914
well, if Veronica's got one guilty outcome and Clarissa's got one guilty outcome and really

698
00:41:29,934 --> 00:41:34,015
there's nothing very exciting or dramatic going on, then it's probably a suicide.

699
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:38,740
And we have a narrative reason why that's a not very satisfying ending to the story,

700
00:41:39,241 --> 00:41:43,123
which does the job that we need it to do, which is to say to the player, go away and try harder.

701
00:41:44,525 --> 00:41:48,828
So that's cool.

702
00:41:50,015 --> 00:41:57,621
So the basic principle of all of this is a bit like the Holmes and Watson model that I mentioned, right?

703
00:41:58,061 --> 00:42:05,107
Even though it's a game about falsifying a conviction, about faking evidence and constructing a crime,

704
00:42:05,347 --> 00:42:09,490
you are essentially constructing an argument. You're just doing the evidence first as well.

705
00:42:11,171 --> 00:42:15,874
But the crucial thing is that it doesn't cast the player in the role of the master detective,

706
00:42:15,934 --> 00:42:20,196
or kind of the phrase master detective is sort of polluted by Sherlock Holmes really,

707
00:42:20,456 --> 00:42:23,918
because the point is the player is the detective, the player does go out into the world,

708
00:42:24,378 --> 00:42:28,061
asks questions, discovers information, brings it to the attention of other people.

709
00:42:29,161 --> 00:42:34,025
goes to the right place at the right time and solves the various combination locks that the game has to offer.

710
00:42:34,646 --> 00:42:41,111
But the detective doesn't get to be the judge. The detective is not there to assess the quality of the conclusion.

711
00:42:41,832 --> 00:42:43,994
Somebody else does that.

712
00:42:45,055 --> 00:42:50,156
And by the time they come to do that, the player has set up their initial conditions and is just trying to push an argument through,

713
00:42:50,196 --> 00:42:52,757
so construct an argument that the judge will be happy with.

714
00:42:53,197 --> 00:42:56,378
The player is feeding inputs into a system to get the outcome that they want.

715
00:42:56,958 --> 00:43:02,039
And so it's not a combination lock because it doesn't have an input that you are trying to hit.

716
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:09,962
It's a bit more like giving a set of directions to a little rat before it runs into a maze and seeing which door it comes out of the other side.

717
00:43:10,442 --> 00:43:11,643
There are lots of solutions.

718
00:43:12,003 --> 00:43:14,285
In fact, we don't know how many solutions Overboard has

719
00:43:14,345 --> 00:43:16,887
because why would we care about that information at all?

720
00:43:17,187 --> 00:43:19,990
It's just so long as every solution that we've seen

721
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:23,392
makes sense and feels fair, then the game works fine

722
00:43:23,412 --> 00:43:24,333
and that's good enough for us.

723
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:27,996
So that's the sort of broad idea

724
00:43:28,036 --> 00:43:29,417
of how we approached it for Overboard.

725
00:43:30,488 --> 00:43:34,050
And while we were making it, it was mostly just a quick Christie or March.

726
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,512
But the more I look back on it, the more I wonder about how generalizable this is

727
00:43:37,632 --> 00:43:42,374
as an idea for creating a bit of drama in the story of the detective game,

728
00:43:42,834 --> 00:43:46,836
because I think a point that gets lost a lot when we're thinking about detective

729
00:43:46,856 --> 00:43:52,339
stories is the thing that Christie was so confident about in her writing,

730
00:43:52,419 --> 00:43:56,100
that there are two stories in a detective story, not one, but two.

731
00:43:57,748 --> 00:44:01,013
One of them is the story of the crime, the what happened and why.

732
00:44:01,614 --> 00:44:04,559
And then the other one is the story of the detective and the characters

733
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:07,644
affected by the murder, dealing with the aftermath of the murder

734
00:44:07,764 --> 00:44:09,507
or whatever's happened and solving it.

735
00:44:10,408 --> 00:44:12,670
And that is a valid story. And it's an important one, too.

736
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:14,670
Christie novels always have a love affair in them.

737
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:17,052
You can always tell people who are not going to be guilty

738
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:19,573
because there is always a young couple who fall in love at the end.

739
00:44:19,933 --> 00:44:22,874
That's just standard logic for a story told in that time.

740
00:44:23,875 --> 00:44:25,636
Actually, Conan Doyle does this, too.

741
00:44:26,176 --> 00:44:28,257
Sherlock Holmes stories are structured much less elegantly.

742
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:30,918
There's like 80 percent of it is Sherlock and Watson running around,

743
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:33,199
having a fun time on trains and hitting people with sticks.

744
00:44:33,299 --> 00:44:34,320
And then the last 10 percent.

745
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:39,242
is the guilty party usually sitting down with Holmes over a nice cup of tea and a pipe and

746
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:42,803
telling him some story about a thing that happened in the colonies which is why he ended up sending

747
00:44:42,843 --> 00:44:45,844
orange pips to this person or murdering this person or writing stick figures on a well.

748
00:44:46,705 --> 00:44:51,166
The two stories are completely separated in Conan Doyle's writing but they're still both there,

749
00:44:51,226 --> 00:44:55,688
there's the adventure we enjoy and then there's the weird colonial rant that Conan Doyle would

750
00:44:55,728 --> 00:45:00,930
like to go on now and they're put side by side. Christie layers them together and then brings

751
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:03,672
them together in a conclusion scene with Poirot doing that.

752
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:11,719
And the reason that's important is it gives us depth to our world because we have a secret history to be uncovered.

753
00:45:11,979 --> 00:45:14,242
But it also gives us just a tub thumping good adventure.

754
00:45:14,522 --> 00:45:19,389
We get some characters to be with. We get a protagonist moving through a world, exploring and having an adventure.

755
00:45:20,009 --> 00:45:23,971
being a real person in a room full of people in a dramatic, intense situation,

756
00:45:24,011 --> 00:45:27,153
which is generally speaking why mystery stories are enjoyable.

757
00:45:27,573 --> 00:45:30,154
It's if you think about the mysteries that you watch on TV,

758
00:45:30,214 --> 00:45:33,035
especially the ones made by ABC Studios,

759
00:45:33,756 --> 00:45:37,117
you've got to remember that the backstory part is never as interesting

760
00:45:37,157 --> 00:45:37,878
as the story part.

761
00:45:37,898 --> 00:45:39,198
We're rooting for the detective.

762
00:45:39,238 --> 00:45:40,479
We're rooting for the characters.

763
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:41,560
And oh, yeah, there's this mystery.

764
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,800
And we kind of want to know what happened,

765
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,641
but it's rarely the focus of of our engagement.

766
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:48,323
So I think it's pretty cool.

767
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:50,590
I guess that's what I'm saying. I think it's pretty cool.

768
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:52,411
A few other notes on the design.

769
00:45:53,552 --> 00:45:54,794
Firstly, it feels quite natural.

770
00:45:55,054 --> 00:45:57,376
Like writing it was not a big theoretical,

771
00:45:57,396 --> 00:45:58,377
complicated exercise.

772
00:45:58,417 --> 00:46:01,219
There's no weird UI to be assimilated.

773
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,421
We don't have to really tutorialize anything

774
00:46:03,501 --> 00:46:05,383
because it's just people talking to each other.

775
00:46:05,904 --> 00:46:08,045
The player gathers some material, they present it,

776
00:46:08,286 --> 00:46:09,987
it's assessed, and if it's not good enough,

777
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:12,049
they get sent back to find some more

778
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,871
until they have something which is convincing.

779
00:46:15,032 --> 00:46:15,692
It feels to me...

780
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:20,335
weirdly like a really familiar design, except I can't actually think of anywhere I've seen it before,

781
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:22,857
except possibly in the two Infocom games that I mentioned at the start of the talk.

782
00:46:22,897 --> 00:46:25,418
There are no new ideas in game design, right?

783
00:46:25,558 --> 00:46:29,901
The second thing I want to note is that Overboard is very definitely replay to win.

784
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:32,442
It's structured to put this conversation at the climax.

785
00:46:32,482 --> 00:46:33,183
And if you go wrong.

786
00:46:33,654 --> 00:46:38,940
You get thrown into jail or throw yourself off a boat and you try again with different starting parameters until you get it right.

787
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:45,907
But it doesn't have to be that way. There's nothing about this design which is inherently a replay to learn game.

788
00:46:46,287 --> 00:46:52,934
You could, for example, play the detective who phones up the police chief to explain what they've learnt so far and lays out the case as they see it.

789
00:46:53,054 --> 00:46:56,598
And the police chief says, no, I'm not sure about that bit. You need more evidence for this.

790
00:46:57,738 --> 00:47:00,819
We can't get arrest because we haven't got enough data on that, that and that.

791
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:01,580
Go away and get me more.

792
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,000
And then you come back and you get some more.

793
00:47:03,421 --> 00:47:05,162
In that case, a failed state isn't being sent to prison.

794
00:47:05,202 --> 00:47:08,023
It's just let's start from the top or let's look around some more.

795
00:47:08,083 --> 00:47:09,043
Call me back in an hour.

796
00:47:10,984 --> 00:47:15,947
And it doesn't have to be dialogue like I did it through dialogue because I like

797
00:47:15,987 --> 00:47:20,309
dialogue, but and it's fairly natural way to present this idea.

798
00:47:20,389 --> 00:47:24,971
But for people who like you, I and they like connecting boxes and filling things in.

799
00:47:26,108 --> 00:47:28,489
you could imagine a proforma where you say,

800
00:47:28,709 --> 00:47:31,790
so, I don't know, blank went here and did blank,

801
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:32,811
and then you drag in the blank,

802
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:33,791
and you drag in the next blank,

803
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:35,832
and then that unravels into a next bit of conversation.

804
00:47:36,132 --> 00:47:38,853
And the story unfolds depending on exactly

805
00:47:39,173 --> 00:47:40,894
how you feed it, right?

806
00:47:41,674 --> 00:47:43,475
I have a suspicion this is what Veilbetter's

807
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:46,096
Mask of the Rose deduction system is gonna be like,

808
00:47:46,116 --> 00:47:47,217
but I haven't actually played that demo enough

809
00:47:47,277 --> 00:47:48,037
to be sure about that.

810
00:47:48,077 --> 00:47:48,477
So we'll see.

811
00:47:50,958 --> 00:47:52,699
Such a system, if you built it that way,

812
00:47:53,439 --> 00:47:54,440
would still be curated.

813
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:58,233
It's still filtering the options down to make sure that I don't get overloaded.

814
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:01,414
It's still building an argument organically from the ground up.

815
00:48:01,454 --> 00:48:05,795
It's perhaps a little bit more constrained in its structure, but it's not very constrained.

816
00:48:05,835 --> 00:48:10,477
It's certainly not so rigid that it has to be fact one plus fact two equals fact three or nothing.

817
00:48:10,497 --> 00:48:16,719
And it is capable of expressing different kinds of ideas or bringing in ideas from the real world or bringing in new ideas.

818
00:48:16,959 --> 00:48:20,100
There's no reason you can't drag in ladies button their coats left over, right?

819
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:21,940
If it seems like a relevant thing to drag in.

820
00:48:22,707 --> 00:48:27,802
And it will be a surprising moment, if perhaps a fairly obvious one in the context of that instance of the game.

821
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:34,702
Finally, the correct path can be very broad, which I think ultimately we have to agree that that's probably a good thing,

822
00:48:34,782 --> 00:48:39,023
because frustration in detective games is a real problem and truth is a big, broad concept.

823
00:48:39,043 --> 00:48:42,764
There shouldn't really be a single solution path. It doesn't make a lot of sense.

824
00:48:42,784 --> 00:48:45,664
And every time I try to write one, it just goes wrong because it's ludicrous.

825
00:48:45,704 --> 00:48:54,927
Right. So we're effectively talking about something which is a kind of simulation, though it depends how you build it exactly, but a simulation of an argument.

826
00:48:55,504 --> 00:48:59,986
not a branching tree narrative in which you die on these instances and you don't die on that instance.

827
00:49:01,547 --> 00:49:06,930
So to summarise all of that, to put all of that together, I think it's like I said earlier,

828
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:12,332
I want to get away from this idea that the combination lock is the.

829
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:18,927
core model of what the detective does, that the detective is constantly cracking a correct

830
00:49:19,007 --> 00:49:24,430
answer from a set of impossible answers. Away from Sherlock Holmes and his, when you've removed

831
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:28,111
everything that's impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.

832
00:49:28,171 --> 00:49:32,614
Which, you know, fine, yes, that's true, but that's not the most interesting way to solve

833
00:49:32,694 --> 00:49:36,796
a detective narrative. It's not the most sparkling conclusion to a narrative. It is the five in the

834
00:49:36,816 --> 00:49:38,276
middle of the sudoku, which...

835
00:49:39,292 --> 00:49:40,373
is a perfectly good solution.

836
00:49:40,613 --> 00:49:41,074
It'll do.

837
00:49:41,214 --> 00:49:43,195
It sort of says, well, when you've tried everything,

838
00:49:43,235 --> 00:49:44,476
you might as well go with this one.

839
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:47,258
It's a bit like, I don't know. Yeah, it's not.

840
00:49:47,278 --> 00:49:49,620
It's not very it doesn't fill me with excitement, really.

841
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:51,382
The great thing about the end of a Poirot novel

842
00:49:51,622 --> 00:49:53,443
is that when Poirot turns around and accuses someone,

843
00:49:53,463 --> 00:49:55,645
it's always the person who it obviously was from the beginning.

844
00:49:55,725 --> 00:49:57,967
And Poirot's argument is usually, I knew that you did it.

845
00:49:58,267 --> 00:50:00,328
You're the only person in this room capable of murder.

846
00:50:00,589 --> 00:50:01,990
But then I had to figure out how and why.

847
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:04,011
And there's something really nice about that.

848
00:50:04,031 --> 00:50:06,193
There's something really solid and charming about that, I think.

849
00:50:07,146 --> 00:50:09,726
So let's move away from deduction.

850
00:50:10,527 --> 00:50:12,407
Deduction means taking things away.

851
00:50:12,827 --> 00:50:13,747
Let's stop doing that.

852
00:50:14,007 --> 00:50:15,588
Let's move towards construction,

853
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:19,388
towards building and growing and developing a narrative

854
00:50:19,448 --> 00:50:22,009
that we can be part of and we can be excited about.

855
00:50:23,029 --> 00:50:24,810
That's what I think we should be doing for Detective Games.

856
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:26,170
Thank you for listening.

857
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:29,411
I will attempt to take questions over the magical internet,

858
00:50:29,491 --> 00:50:30,851
but otherwise I'm done.

859
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:43,731
Hi there, thank you, that was spectacular.

860
00:50:45,052 --> 00:50:50,375
I'm wondering as a person who makes visual novels and adores detective games, why did

861
00:50:50,395 --> 00:50:55,898
you choose to go with the set dressing of a visual novel and would you have chosen a

862
00:50:55,958 --> 00:50:59,780
different kind of format if you were going to make it again?

863
00:50:59,800 --> 00:50:59,841
So

864
00:51:04,532 --> 00:51:10,135
I have a kind of honest answer, which I feel like I ought to say, which is we made it the way we did

865
00:51:10,195 --> 00:51:14,596
because we really did try to make this game as fast as possible because we were supposed to be

866
00:51:14,636 --> 00:51:19,498
working on our Highland game and like we kind of did this for fun. So the format we took was because

867
00:51:19,518 --> 00:51:24,060
it was very easy to implement and to understand from a design point of view. We saw like the

868
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,561
classic visual novel there, we were like yep we can definitely build that, let's build that.

869
00:51:28,602 --> 00:51:30,143
And that is the honest reason why we did it.

870
00:51:30,443 --> 00:51:33,024
Why I think it works, because I think it does work,

871
00:51:33,865 --> 00:51:36,326
and whether that's luck or not,

872
00:51:36,846 --> 00:51:38,207
I leave this an exercise to the reader.

873
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,929
But the reason that it works is that it focuses the game

874
00:51:42,129 --> 00:51:43,710
entirely on people.

875
00:51:44,903 --> 00:51:45,463
and nothing else.

876
00:51:45,924 --> 00:51:47,585
And I suppose that's why it works in visual novels

877
00:51:47,645 --> 00:51:48,285
as well, actually.

878
00:51:48,686 --> 00:51:50,747
That if you were to build it as a point and click adventure,

879
00:51:50,767 --> 00:51:54,190
then we get a lot of distraction in terms of the environment

880
00:51:54,210 --> 00:51:56,652
or just the business of walking from over here to over there.

881
00:51:57,072 --> 00:52:00,415
And all of that kind of stagy mechanics

882
00:52:00,495 --> 00:52:01,756
that come with adventure games,

883
00:52:01,776 --> 00:52:02,997
they're very, very hard to solve

884
00:52:03,517 --> 00:52:06,640
and that actually detract from the naturalness

885
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,222
of the people in your story world, right?

886
00:52:09,302 --> 00:52:11,563
If I'm wandering around a room aimlessly looking at things.

887
00:52:11,884 --> 00:52:14,765
and this character sitting in the middle paying no attention to what I'm doing,

888
00:52:14,805 --> 00:52:16,706
they look more robotic.

889
00:52:17,146 --> 00:52:21,868
Whereas in Overboard, we simply put an abstract image of you, image of them,

890
00:52:22,549 --> 00:52:26,270
we can imply any amount of movement around the room, but it never breaks visually.

891
00:52:26,691 --> 00:52:30,472
So our feeling for why it works is it's just it gets to the point.

892
00:52:31,913 --> 00:52:32,914
of what the thing is supposed to be.

893
00:52:32,974 --> 00:52:34,935
And I suspect that's exactly why it works really well

894
00:52:34,975 --> 00:52:35,716
for visual novels.

895
00:52:35,876 --> 00:52:38,478
Actually, it's like, it's attractive art style.

896
00:52:38,518 --> 00:52:40,239
You can really see what the characters are thinking.

897
00:52:40,259 --> 00:52:42,481
You can see their faces and you're listening to their talk

898
00:52:42,621 --> 00:52:44,002
and nothing else is relevant.

899
00:52:45,523 --> 00:52:48,225
So that's why I think if we were to build another one,

900
00:52:48,846 --> 00:52:50,747
apart from the sheer fact that we have all the code now,

901
00:52:50,807 --> 00:52:53,890
so it would be really nice to just build it the same way.

902
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:57,192
But I think I really like it actually.

903
00:52:57,352 --> 00:52:57,492
And.

904
00:52:58,073 --> 00:53:02,858
You know, I don't think it's a game where traversal is massively important.

905
00:53:02,978 --> 00:53:07,623
So I think, you know, if I was to look at ways of developing the art style,

906
00:53:07,743 --> 00:53:09,325
I would push the bespoke art.

907
00:53:09,705 --> 00:53:11,647
So, you know, I would have her hiding behind a sofa

908
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:14,470
and we would see that as a specific shot from a different angle.

909
00:53:14,511 --> 00:53:17,213
And we would have more cutaways of like interesting items or.

910
00:53:17,479 --> 00:53:19,681
particular expressions or particular moments in the game.

911
00:53:20,081 --> 00:53:21,062
Because I think once you have a,

912
00:53:21,762 --> 00:53:23,984
we often talk about at Inkle,

913
00:53:24,084 --> 00:53:26,546
about a sensible default and overrides

914
00:53:26,606 --> 00:53:28,588
being the best way to get coverage on a game,

915
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,429
especially a wide and branching one.

916
00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:33,171
So you have a sensible default of characters, room,

917
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:33,972
it's sorted.

918
00:53:34,032 --> 00:53:35,493
You can make the whole game that way.

919
00:53:35,833 --> 00:53:37,214
And then you can spend all of your fun time

920
00:53:37,555 --> 00:53:39,436
doing overrides for all the exciting moments.

921
00:53:39,596 --> 00:53:40,637
Like there's a bit in Overboard

922
00:53:40,657 --> 00:53:42,078
where she hides behind a pot plant.

923
00:53:42,198 --> 00:53:44,080
And we have a picture of her skulking out

924
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:44,940
from behind a pot plant.

925
00:53:45,137 --> 00:53:45,578
And I love it.

926
00:53:45,898 --> 00:53:46,940
And it's not important at all,

927
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,083
but it's just that's where our time and money

928
00:53:49,123 --> 00:53:50,265
should be spent, I think.

929
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:52,648
So yeah.

930
00:53:53,289 --> 00:53:55,332
Yeah, no, the visual novels were really helpful

931
00:53:55,352 --> 00:53:57,255
as a way of just leapfrogging that whole design process

932
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,136
and just getting to a place

933
00:53:58,156 --> 00:53:59,658
we could just get stuck in straight away.

934
00:53:59,718 --> 00:54:00,459
So that was really great.

935
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:01,461
Thank you.

936
00:54:04,065 --> 00:54:09,167
Hello. I was wondering if while doing this sort of like,

937
00:54:09,308 --> 00:54:13,770
showdown with the detective war and really any sort of sort of

938
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:17,432
the endgame part of that if you have to consider weighing

939
00:54:17,572 --> 00:54:22,395
certain victories or losses in the sort of topics that come up

940
00:54:23,115 --> 00:54:31,337
and also have to adjust their values depending on the context possibly changing on a future response.

941
00:54:31,377 --> 00:54:38,259
So for example, let's say you get caught in a lie. That would be, say, a point against you.

942
00:54:38,539 --> 00:54:44,160
Then if you recontextualize it, you'd have to maybe neutralize that or maybe give it a plus one.

943
00:54:45,601 --> 00:54:51,006
Do you sometimes worry that in the end, you might come up with this answer that feels

944
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:56,772
not necessarily unsatisfactory, but very strange, like say the text says, well, there are these

945
00:54:56,812 --> 00:55:00,275
three things that prove that you're innocent.

946
00:55:01,136 --> 00:55:05,660
But there's this one very strange or bad thing that you did that we're going to have to put

947
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:10,364
you in an or or even weirder, or it's like they say like this long tangent on why you

948
00:55:10,465 --> 00:55:10,785
did it.

949
00:55:11,506 --> 00:55:13,307
And then there was just one final bit at the end when they get,

950
00:55:13,788 --> 00:55:18,012
but you couldn't have done it because X, Y, or Z. And that kind of feels very strange.

951
00:55:18,432 --> 00:55:22,856
Yeah. So I think, um, what we found was that we,

952
00:55:23,097 --> 00:55:26,420
we built that scene and we play tested it a lot. Basically I had a random.

953
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:31,523
a random player and it did a bunch of things for me but one of the things it did was set up a random

954
00:55:31,643 --> 00:55:36,067
initial parameter space like at the start of that scene it just writes down what the player's done

955
00:55:36,127 --> 00:55:41,070
as a very large list of booleans and then it set them randomly and it played the scene to see what

956
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:44,913
would happen and the great thing about we're writing this in ink which we're pretty adept

957
00:55:44,933 --> 00:55:50,016
with now but it's generally quite a flexible scripting language so you'd get to a point where

958
00:55:50,136 --> 00:55:50,877
a conversation with

959
00:55:51,517 --> 00:55:55,542
jump a track like that, like the character would suddenly spin on a six fence and say,

960
00:55:55,582 --> 00:55:59,205
you're so guilty, you're so guilty, Anna, you're fine actually. And when you play through,

961
00:55:59,986 --> 00:56:04,331
you see that and you go, oh wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

962
00:56:04,651 --> 00:56:08,976
in the case where the player is just ridiculously guilty and is trying this cheesy cop out,

963
00:56:09,256 --> 00:56:09,817
don't let it work.

964
00:56:10,457 --> 00:56:12,659
And it takes only a couple of minutes

965
00:56:12,699 --> 00:56:14,180
to write that kind of thing.

966
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,841
And it feels beautifully rewarding

967
00:56:15,861 --> 00:56:17,322
when you hit it as a player, because it's so

968
00:56:17,382 --> 00:56:18,663
specific to what happened to you.

969
00:56:19,244 --> 00:56:21,806
And there must be 1,000 of those in the conclusion of Overboard.

970
00:56:22,126 --> 00:56:24,628
And because the tools make it really fast for us

971
00:56:24,648 --> 00:56:27,370
to just muck about with the specific cases,

972
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:30,932
and because the flow itself starts here, goes there,

973
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,494
and doesn't go crazy in the flow graph or anything like that,

974
00:56:33,915 --> 00:56:35,196
it's actually very stable to do.

975
00:56:35,256 --> 00:56:36,116
You just say, right, you're here.

976
00:56:36,196 --> 00:56:37,677
We're giving you this mark, putting you there.

977
00:56:37,878 --> 00:56:38,518
The game carries on.

978
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:45,188
So lots and lots and lots of playtesting and kind of working and working and working on it to try

979
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:49,714
and make it as seamless as possible. And you know our beta testers and our QA people and people who

980
00:56:49,754 --> 00:56:52,599
played the pre-release version were invaluable for that as well because they would play it and say

981
00:56:52,879 --> 00:56:54,401
oh I didn't like this ending, this one wasn't good.

982
00:56:56,067 --> 00:56:59,969
So I think that to me feels like part of the crafting of the scene.

983
00:57:00,069 --> 00:57:03,451
And it's such an important scene, we could afford to spend a lot of our time doing that.

984
00:57:04,331 --> 00:57:09,173
So yeah, definitely a problem, but one that you can solve without getting too systemic about it,

985
00:57:09,253 --> 00:57:10,754
I think. Thank you.

986
00:57:13,432 --> 00:57:15,133
Thank you so much for your talk. This is really great.

987
00:57:16,213 --> 00:57:23,936
You discussed the fact mechanic and detective games having to be represented by UI which then like precludes things like intuition or knowledge of human nature.

988
00:57:24,977 --> 00:57:31,159
Did you have any feelings about how Disco Museum handled that with the thought cabinet where they had their detective go out and get

989
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:36,761
ideas about human nature or about intuition as like that was their inventory with their ideas and using that?

990
00:57:37,341 --> 00:57:41,103
Did that kind of address that problem or did that feel satisfying to you as someone that makes detective games?

991
00:57:45,106 --> 00:57:55,214
Um, I felt like they were doing something different, um, that kind of fitted with their

992
00:57:55,655 --> 00:57:58,257
aesthetic and their style and their narrative. I'm not...

993
00:57:59,374 --> 00:58:06,996
sure whether I think Disco Elysium fits this model of a detective game or not off the top of my head.

994
00:58:07,336 --> 00:58:16,139
It's a complicated and odd game in many ways, and I'm not sure whether it has a clear closed deduction loop exactly.

995
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:21,780
So I don't know. I also think that it's a solution. It's quite abstract.

996
00:58:22,281 --> 00:58:27,102
And like that works for them. I don't know whether it would work in a more kind of.

997
00:58:27,824 --> 00:58:32,586
low key setting, like, you know, you can't really send Poirot into the world to learn

998
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:37,548
a detail about human nature and then shove it in his mind palace. It feels a bit weird.

999
00:58:38,528 --> 00:58:42,490
But yeah, apparently I'm out of time. So thank you very much for coming, everybody.

1000
00:58:42,610 --> 00:58:45,771
Enjoy San Francisco and the sun. I'm sorry not to be with you and take care.

1001
00:58:45,791 --> 00:58:46,872
Thank you. Thanks for listening.
