1
00:00:04,936 --> 00:00:09,979
How we doing? I think we're good. Please make sure to turn off all your

2
00:00:09,979 --> 00:00:14,662
phones, electronic devices, anything else that might be making sound. And

3
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:19,445
you'll get a, uh, we speaker form coming to your, um, inbox after this.

4
00:00:19,445 --> 00:00:22,847
Might go to your spam box. So if you could fill it in, that'd be great.

5
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:25,288
Uh, the GDC folks really like it when you do that.

6
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:29,827
So, my name is Alex Moll. I'm the chief technical director at

7
00:00:29,827 --> 00:00:35,210
Criterion Games. We're a small EA studio just outside of London,

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,613
England, where we're currently having the best time we've ever

9
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:41,995
had and we're making the best games we ever have. And so I'm

10
00:00:41,995 --> 00:00:45,857
here to tell you how. So I'll start off by talking a little

11
00:00:45,857 --> 00:00:51,140
bit about our back story and then I'll move on to how that

12
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,062
led us to come up with a new philosophy for how to make games

13
00:00:54,062 --> 00:00:54,442
better.

14
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,824
I'll then talk a bit about how we've proven that this actually

15
00:00:59,824 --> 00:01:02,286
scales to triple A production and why we're confident this is

16
00:01:02,286 --> 00:01:05,809
great. And then I'll move on to some specific practices that we

17
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:09,732
use day to day to implement this new philosophy. And finally I'll

18
00:01:09,732 --> 00:01:12,775
sum up. So first of all, where did this come from?

19
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:19,028
So hopefully some of you have at least heard of some of our games.

20
00:01:19,028 --> 00:01:24,173
We're really proud of these. We've got a rabid fan base who we're very happy with

21
00:01:24,173 --> 00:01:25,895
who are always talking to us about them.

22
00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:30,216
All of these games are characterized by at least my

23
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:33,379
memories of them are characterized by two things. So

24
00:01:33,379 --> 00:01:37,383
one is a very high Metacritic. So I think the lowest Metacritic

25
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:40,626
on that slide there was about 86 and I think it goes up to 94 for

26
00:01:40,626 --> 00:01:44,590
Metacritic at launch. Huge critical success, very popular

27
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,853
games and certainly I didn't work on Burnout 3 but I joined

28
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:49,455
the studio because I loved it so much.

29
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:53,566
But the other thing that those games were all categorized by

30
00:01:53,566 --> 00:01:54,786
is really low team morale.

31
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:56,407
So there's, I know there's a whole bunch

32
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,129
of ex-Criterion folks in the audience here

33
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:02,431
and they're all smiling and so I think this is true,

34
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:03,671
and not just for me.

35
00:02:03,671 --> 00:02:06,273
So there was a bunch of staff turnover.

36
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:09,054
There was an awful lot of unhappiness and frustration,

37
00:02:09,054 --> 00:02:11,836
an awful lot of crunch, a crazy amount of crunch.

38
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:18,875
And when we looked at the reasons for that low morale,

39
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:22,079
really a lot of it came down to this reason.

40
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:26,045
So on a medium-sized team of maybe 70 to 150 people,

41
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:28,448
there wasn't really anyone who had a chance

42
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,291
of making a good decision that would stick.

43
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:34,118
that led to much of the team pouring their hearts into

44
00:02:34,118 --> 00:02:37,880
features that were just always destined to be cut. And that

45
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,741
was actually compounded by a constant feeling of being behind

46
00:02:40,741 --> 00:02:44,002
relative to some ideal game studio who was much better at it

47
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:48,744
than us. And that feeling of behind meant that we were always

48
00:02:48,744 --> 00:02:52,185
scrabbling to build things as fast as we could rather than

49
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:54,446
taking the time to figure out how to work efficiently and

50
00:02:54,446 --> 00:02:57,947
effectively. And so we wasted a huge amount of time and effort.

51
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:04,731
And the upshot of that was that much of the team was under-motivated despite being incredibly

52
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:05,252
passionate.

53
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:11,996
And we had people working really crazy hours and making themselves properly ill, long-term

54
00:03:11,996 --> 00:03:16,459
relationships breaking up, all sorts of really horrible stuff that people were willingly

55
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:22,983
putting themselves through and despite all of that passion, they were still really under-motivated.

56
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:25,845
No one really wanted to do this stuff.

57
00:03:26,925 --> 00:03:29,628
And the other part of it was most of the team just weren't

58
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:32,790
empowered to make decisions despite knowing everyone else on

59
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,853
the team. And that doesn't make any sense because on a small

60
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:38,895
team where you know everybody, you should just be able to walk

61
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:41,217
over to the right person and ask for whatever information you

62
00:03:41,217 --> 00:03:44,000
need to support making the decision you're trying to make.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,022
But that didn't happen. What happened instead was we would

64
00:03:47,022 --> 00:03:50,305
brute force our way to great games but at very high personal

65
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:50,525
cost.

66
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:54,976
So in early 2014, there was a big change in studio

67
00:03:54,976 --> 00:03:57,638
leadership. You may have seen it reported in the press as the

68
00:03:57,638 --> 00:04:01,280
death of criterion. If anything, it was quite the opposite. The

69
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,523
new leadership, myself included, seized the opportunity to do

70
00:04:04,523 --> 00:04:07,625
things better on a new game. We believed that it would be

71
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:11,248
possible to make AAA in a sustainable way. And so we took

72
00:04:11,248 --> 00:04:14,490
our inspiration from the best of other AAA studios and indie

73
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:18,373
developers and then found places where science backed up and

74
00:04:18,373 --> 00:04:19,494
codified our approach.

75
00:04:20,318 --> 00:04:22,922
And I've got to be honest, I'm really grateful to the EA

76
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:25,246
Studios leadership who gave us an enormous amount of

77
00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:27,189
encouragement and time and space to try these crazy new

78
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:31,636
ideas and ultimately prove that they really worked.

79
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,731
So personally I was very inspired and still am very

80
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:38,913
inspired by indies. I love coming to GDC and hanging out

81
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:42,795
in the indie game summit. And one thing that was very clear to

82
00:04:42,795 --> 00:04:46,257
me was that small teams where everyone really knows the whole

83
00:04:46,257 --> 00:04:49,499
game that they're working on and they're able to turn on a dime

84
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:52,120
just don't suffer from these really horrible issues that we

85
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,502
were struggling with. So we figured, well, it's definitely

86
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:59,224
possible for small teams, so surely we can get this to scale

87
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:00,345
to big teams, too.

88
00:05:03,073 --> 00:05:05,375
So we came up with a new philosophy. Given what we'd

89
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:09,818
learned, we set about turning all of that experience into a

90
00:05:09,818 --> 00:05:12,500
coherent set of practices that would allow us to make games

91
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,302
better. And over time we've managed to distill it down into

92
00:05:15,302 --> 00:05:18,484
something coherent. But we started off with this question.

93
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,466
If we just assumed that everybody's here to make the

94
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:24,108
best games they can, what would we do differently? And we

95
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:28,351
figured we'd do two things differently. So the first thing

96
00:05:28,351 --> 00:05:30,052
is treating people as talent.

97
00:05:30,742 --> 00:05:33,223
That means letting people make the right decisions for the

98
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:36,566
game using their own skill and judgment and expertise, because

99
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:38,988
we hire great people, so obviously they should make great

100
00:05:38,988 --> 00:05:42,891
decisions. And the other thing we do is actively eradicate

101
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:47,874
harmful dogma. There's lots of examples of harmful dogma. One

102
00:05:47,874 --> 00:05:51,857
includes the expectation of crunch. So research has proven

103
00:05:51,857 --> 00:05:56,541
that crunch is only beneficial for 48 hours and is detrimental

104
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:59,043
after as little as a week or two.

105
00:05:59,948 --> 00:06:05,917
So it's really, in my opinion, nothing more than legacy and fear and some macho posturing

106
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:08,120
that means that we still expect crunch.

107
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,724
It's, you know, science tells us it's a waste of time.

108
00:06:11,484 --> 00:06:14,627
But it's also things like expecting to use a centrally

109
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:18,049
distributed list of tasks, maybe like a Hansoft or a Jira type

110
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:20,851
thing, to determine how the game gets made.

111
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:24,254
Because the person with the best understanding of how to fix

112
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:27,457
a problem is just going to be the person who will be fixing

113
00:06:27,457 --> 00:06:27,977
that problem.

114
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:30,879
It's not going to be someone off in another room typing tasks

115
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,420
into some big spreadsheet.

116
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,044
So it's really the studio's job to facilitate the team to pick

117
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:40,146
the best problems to fix and then really help them and guide

118
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:41,027
them on how to fix them.

119
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:44,773
So we have this, as a little aside,

120
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:46,995
we have this poster up in our office,

121
00:06:46,995 --> 00:06:48,716
and I really hope that this just seems

122
00:06:48,716 --> 00:06:51,519
totally weird and obvious to you.

123
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,700
Unfortunately, big games companies,

124
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,422
and I'm pretty sure all big tech companies,

125
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:57,944
often use the word resource to mean person.

126
00:06:58,997 --> 00:07:01,299
Now I'd argue that's always inappropriate,

127
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:03,522
but certainly for any creative endeavor,

128
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:05,264
it's provably inappropriate.

129
00:07:05,264 --> 00:07:08,388
Because a creative collaboration between the right people

130
00:07:08,388 --> 00:07:11,191
won't just get you the right results sooner,

131
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:12,513
it'll generally deliver you a result

132
00:07:12,513 --> 00:07:14,675
that wouldn't otherwise have been possible.

133
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:17,458
So the trick is really to gather the right people

134
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:19,140
and then help them to creatively collaborate.

135
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:23,680
So at Criterion, as leaders, we've stopped telling people

136
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,381
what to do, because that presumes we're more experts in

137
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:29,983
their field than they are. And instead, what we do is we take

138
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:34,124
time to sell ideas to teams of creative collaborators. And then

139
00:07:34,124 --> 00:07:36,906
when those little teams and those creative collaborations

140
00:07:36,906 --> 00:07:39,787
engage with those problems, they're able to take them into

141
00:07:39,787 --> 00:07:43,048
delightful new directions that we would never have expected.

142
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:45,909
And I wish that I could tell you some more about the game we're

143
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:48,090
making at the moment, because I have some videos that illustrate

144
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,451
this just perfectly, but sadly we're not there yet.

145
00:07:51,033 --> 00:07:55,516
If nobody on the team wants to work on a feature, wants to

146
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,939
engage with a feature, then one of two things has happened.

147
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:01,841
Either we've not done a good enough job of selling it, and

148
00:08:01,841 --> 00:08:04,743
maybe that means we don't understand why it's truly

149
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:08,806
valuable, or maybe it's just not a very good feature and the

150
00:08:08,806 --> 00:08:11,608
team is tacitly telling us, bin that one, move on, there's

151
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:14,970
better stuff. Which is really great feedback for us to have.

152
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,563
And when, when as a leadership, when as a production group, we notice that someone's

153
00:08:20,563 --> 00:08:25,466
made a decision that surprises us, rather than telling them that they're wrong, we'll

154
00:08:25,466 --> 00:08:30,290
speak to them, we'll take the time to educate and be educated, we'll share the bigger picture

155
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:35,314
context that maybe they don't have that led us to believe they'd make a decision differently,

156
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,456
but we'll also listen to the detailed context that they've got on the ground.

157
00:08:39,202 --> 00:08:43,426
and understand why they made their decision in the first place.

158
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:46,048
And either a better decision will get made,

159
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:49,852
or we understand why that was actually the better decision in the first place.

160
00:08:49,852 --> 00:08:54,556
And either way, both of us have come away from that with a greater sense of trust

161
00:08:54,556 --> 00:08:55,617
and general happiness.

162
00:08:57,665 --> 00:09:01,788
So what we've done isn't just hand wavy nonsense as much as I

163
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:05,170
love that. There is actually some science backing this up.

164
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,072
We've looked at a bunch of research and our main

165
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:12,575
inspiration for a lot of what we do is this book, which is

166
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:16,377
actually summarized in a TED talk which Dan Pink gave in 2009

167
00:09:16,377 --> 00:09:20,660
titled the puzzle of motivation. I highly recommend it. It's a

168
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,601
great TED talk. So

169
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:28,599
really his thesis is when it comes to motivation there's a mismatch between what science knows

170
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:34,366
and what business does. And he lays out a compelling case why existing ideas of motivation

171
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:40,993
so things like financial incentives and status rewards like job titles and corner offices

172
00:09:40,993 --> 00:09:44,417
really don't have a big positive benefit on creative pursuits.

173
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,301
but the great news is that science actually knows what

174
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:49,762
things do have a big positive benefit on creative pursuits.

175
00:09:49,762 --> 00:09:52,324
And so really what we've done at Criterion is just the

176
00:09:52,324 --> 00:09:54,705
project management equivalent of taking a seven year old

177
00:09:54,705 --> 00:09:58,086
SIGGRAPH paper and getting it working in video game.

178
00:09:58,086 --> 00:10:02,148
So as Dan Pink says, as soon as people feel that they're

179
00:10:02,148 --> 00:10:04,469
being fairly compensated for their work,

180
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:06,290
money stops being a major motivator.

181
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:09,981
That said, it is crucial that people feel that they are being

182
00:10:09,981 --> 00:10:15,544
fairly compensated. That means that they're being paid what

183
00:10:15,544 --> 00:10:17,926
looks fair relative to the larger industry, but also what

184
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:21,008
looks fair relative to people doing similar roles within their

185
00:10:21,008 --> 00:10:23,329
studio. But as soon as that's out of the way, and I really

186
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:25,891
urge everyone to get that out of the way as soon as possible,

187
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:29,493
there are some big drives that continue to motivate. The first

188
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:34,376
one is autonomy over team, task and technique. The second one is

189
00:10:34,376 --> 00:10:36,797
mastery of a skill that an individual values.

190
00:10:37,707 --> 00:10:41,429
and the third one is working in service to a purpose greater

191
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:45,610
than ourselves. So I'm going to talk about all three of these

192
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,971
in a bit more detail. I'm going to spend a chunk of time on

193
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:51,873
autonomy because it's the most different from traditional

194
00:10:51,873 --> 00:10:54,254
project management and it's where we've seen the best

195
00:10:54,254 --> 00:11:03,217
results. So a rough little definition, autonomy is having

196
00:11:03,217 --> 00:11:05,978
control within project parameters. So I'm going to

197
00:11:06,685 --> 00:11:09,566
over what you work on, who you work with and how you approach

198
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:13,128
that. And that's been shown to be hugely motivational. So we

199
00:11:13,128 --> 00:11:17,830
strived to come up with a way of working that supports all three

200
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,391
of those big pillars. So this is the guidance we give out

201
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:23,533
everyone on the team. So everyone on our team decides

202
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:26,594
where they can have the biggest positive effect at any point in

203
00:11:26,594 --> 00:11:29,976
time. Originally we actually tried using this as the only

204
00:11:29,976 --> 00:11:30,976
rule. Um,

205
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:34,269
And that worked actually pretty well until we got to about a

206
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:38,272
dozen people and after that it got too hard to share enough

207
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:42,295
context and communicate enough to make sure everyone's actually

208
00:11:42,295 --> 00:11:45,178
working on the same game. So now what happens is a production

209
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:48,160
group will provide a handful of big themes, perhaps five to

210
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,203
seven big themes, with suggestions of some priorities

211
00:11:52,203 --> 00:11:55,246
within those themes and then the team just takes it from there.

212
00:11:56,842 --> 00:12:00,943
We've never ever had a situation where nobody wants to work on

213
00:12:00,943 --> 00:12:03,643
something that's really important. So I'll say that

214
00:12:03,643 --> 00:12:06,544
again because we've given this talk a few similar talks to this

215
00:12:06,544 --> 00:12:09,985
a few times within EA and this is always a question and it's a

216
00:12:09,985 --> 00:12:13,786
fair question but we have never had a situation where no one

217
00:12:13,786 --> 00:12:17,707
steps up to a plate to do some even dirty boring ass work.

218
00:12:17,707 --> 00:12:21,047
That's just never happened. A couple of times we've had a

219
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:25,588
scenario where no one's turned up to work on an entire theme.

220
00:12:26,683 --> 00:12:29,143
and that was surprising to us, but when we dug into it, it

221
00:12:29,143 --> 00:12:31,924
turned out that the team had actually noticed that there was

222
00:12:31,924 --> 00:12:35,205
some big dependency that meant that that theme couldn't really

223
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:37,965
usefully be worked on anyway, so they'd gone over to work on

224
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:41,286
delivering that dependency before working on the thing that

225
00:12:41,286 --> 00:12:45,767
we'd naively assumed could be done right now. So the team is

226
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:49,828
really wise, right? There's all this wisdom out in the team and

227
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:51,308
now we get to use it, which is great.

228
00:12:53,018 --> 00:12:55,420
The most surprising problem we've actually had with this

229
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,542
approach is that we've had people choose to work on things

230
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:02,303
that they don't actually value but they feel like they kind of

231
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:06,305
ought to. And that's a subtle distinction but quite an

232
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:09,787
important one. And it can lead to people being quite ineffective

233
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:12,048
and miserable where their skills don't really match the work

234
00:13:12,048 --> 00:13:15,270
they're doing. And it's actually something that we're constantly

235
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,911
vigilant of now, like double checking. Are you working on

236
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:20,933
this for the right reason? Like you actually are interested in

237
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:21,353
this, right?

238
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:27,785
So context becomes very important for us.

239
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:30,926
In a more traditional project management structure,

240
00:13:30,926 --> 00:13:33,327
the big picture of the game is held

241
00:13:33,327 --> 00:13:35,908
by a relatively small number of people on the team.

242
00:13:35,908 --> 00:13:38,009
And those people turn it into chunks

243
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:40,250
of work that get passed out and distributed out

244
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,970
to the main team.

245
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,671
And generally, that keeps everyone

246
00:13:43,671 --> 00:13:46,312
working on roughly the right thing.

247
00:13:46,312 --> 00:13:47,952
But it can lead to this feeling, where.

248
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,863
some folks on the team just don't really understand why

249
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:54,345
they're doing the work that they're doing and it can end up

250
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:57,507
to a lot of that, um, lack of decision making and really that

251
00:13:57,507 --> 00:14:01,450
feeling of helplessness and that huge amount of waste that, um, I

252
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,191
described earlier. So by embracing autonomy and pushing

253
00:14:03,191 --> 00:14:07,655
decision making out across the whole team, we now have a

254
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:12,298
situation where really everyone on the team needs to have as

255
00:14:12,298 --> 00:14:15,200
much of that big picture as possible or they just won't be

256
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,281
able to make good decisions.

257
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,211
And I have to say, as a leader, it's much, much more effort to push that big context

258
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:25,913
out and keep refreshing that than it is to just dole out tasks.

259
00:14:25,913 --> 00:14:26,833
It just is.

260
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:30,174
But the payoff is huge.

261
00:14:30,174 --> 00:14:33,515
As I say, it allows the experts on your team to make all of the easy wins.

262
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:39,381
that service your game in the best way possible and also warn you and guide you away from the

263
00:14:39,381 --> 00:14:44,266
big expensive moon on a stick rabbit holes that producers and designers tend to occasionally

264
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:48,390
for the best will in the world lead us down and those just don't really happen anymore.

265
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:54,076
The context does change and fade over time so it is a full-time

266
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:57,437
job for several people in the studio to keep making sure and

267
00:14:57,437 --> 00:15:00,458
double checking that everyone knows what game we're making and

268
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:04,379
that that's kept up to date but it is, as I say, just

269
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:08,600
astonishingly valuable. So that was the first kind of autonomy.

270
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,701
That was autonomy over task. The second is autonomy over team.

271
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:16,490
So as I mentioned, the feature teams in our studio form

272
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,193
themselves around high-level themes that the production group

273
00:15:21,193 --> 00:15:24,354
has identified. And those feature teams will stay together

274
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:27,836
for as long as it makes sense, and then they'll disband and go

275
00:15:27,836 --> 00:15:32,158
work on other stuff. But it is vital, and this is true for

276
00:15:32,158 --> 00:15:35,900
actually any studio, but it's vital that any team or sub-team

277
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,802
is viable, which means it has the capability to deliver what

278
00:15:39,802 --> 00:15:41,863
it's trying to in the time that it has available.

279
00:15:43,195 --> 00:15:48,101
and that's simply because a viable team is greater than the sum of its parts

280
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:49,283
whereas a non-viable team just isn't.

281
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:53,408
One of the most common mistakes we've made on this journey

282
00:15:53,408 --> 00:15:58,173
is starting work towards a goal without a viable team in place

283
00:15:58,173 --> 00:16:00,756
and it can be surprisingly hard to spot when that's wrong.

284
00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:05,132
The most common cause of non-viability is missing skill

285
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:08,315
sets, but there can be all sorts of other subtle things, like it

286
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:13,059
can be not having access to time from an important reviewer, and

287
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:15,941
we've seen cases where a team will kind of spin its wheels for

288
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:19,924
several days, like gilding the lily, honing something that

289
00:16:19,924 --> 00:16:22,947
they've already kind of proven all the important stuff on, just

290
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:25,729
waiting for a review to tell them how they can move on with

291
00:16:25,729 --> 00:16:25,769
it.

292
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:31,514
So invariably there's two ways of fixing a non-viable team.

293
00:16:31,514 --> 00:16:33,655
There's the obvious one of add more skills to it.

294
00:16:33,655 --> 00:16:36,697
And there's the other really importantly valuable one,

295
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:38,538
which is change the goal posts.

296
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:40,119
Change the goals that they're trying to sign up to.

297
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,940
If you don't have a 2D artist,

298
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,421
well you obviously can't deliver anything that needs 2D art,

299
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:47,223
but there's still probably tons of useful stuff

300
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:49,064
you could deliver in the same kind of direction.

301
00:16:50,204 --> 00:16:56,489
So that's very important. And so what happens in the studio after the teams have initially

302
00:16:56,489 --> 00:17:00,212
formed, they then figure out what goals they'll be working on and we then kind of rationalize

303
00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:03,854
and make sure that the teams are all viable by adjusting goal posts as necessary. And

304
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:07,817
the third part of autonomy is autonomy of a technique. So as I've said, each team is

305
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:16,183
responsible for creating the goals they'll sign up to, but they're also responsible for

306
00:17:16,183 --> 00:17:18,705
deciding exactly how they'll meet those goals.

307
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,653
That includes the exact deliverables that they plan to

308
00:17:23,653 --> 00:17:26,756
create but also includes their daily process. Are they going to

309
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:30,539
work in like an agile scrummy way? Are they going to work in a

310
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:32,000
Kanban iteration style?

311
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:39,264
they decide that. And actually we give each group a process expert, a DD in EA terms,

312
00:17:39,264 --> 00:17:44,226
I don't know what other studios call them, each group gets a DD to really help them,

313
00:17:44,226 --> 00:17:48,427
coach them on which process might work for them and then coach them on how to use that

314
00:17:48,427 --> 00:17:50,368
process throughout the milestone.

315
00:17:51,982 --> 00:17:57,208
So all of this autonomy has the effect that everyone on the team kind of needs to get a bit

316
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:02,133
better at selling. And this is a surprise to us. We didn't realize this would kind of be a

317
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:06,958
sticking point for some people. But designers and producers need to get better at selling

318
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:12,363
things to the team in order to inspire them to come and make them. Because just saying,

319
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:15,706
well, because I said so doesn't work anymore, right? We can't do that.

320
00:18:15,787 --> 00:18:20,995
There's a producer from Criterion laughing ruefully here because he used to maybe enjoy doing that.

321
00:18:20,995 --> 00:18:27,425
There's also experts on the team need to be able to sell the value of long lead technical work.

322
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:31,951
in time for it to be started so that it can deliver value at the

323
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:35,514
end. And they need to be able to sell it to people who can

324
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:39,276
prioritize it within the themes for a milestone. And so as a

325
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:42,979
leadership group we need to be conscious of this and we are.

326
00:18:42,979 --> 00:18:46,901
And so we try and solve it in two ways. Both we coach people

327
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:49,263
on how to sell better when we notice that there's an

328
00:18:49,263 --> 00:18:52,445
opportunity to coach that. But we also actively try and signal

329
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:55,307
boost quiet wise voices so that we get the benefit of their

330
00:18:55,307 --> 00:18:56,328
wisdom across the team.

331
00:18:58,172 --> 00:19:01,873
So that was the end of Dan Pink's first big drive.

332
00:19:01,873 --> 00:19:03,673
That was autonomy.

333
00:19:03,673 --> 00:19:05,073
So moving on now to mastery.

334
00:19:05,073 --> 00:19:08,674
So mastery is everyone mastering skills

335
00:19:08,674 --> 00:19:10,454
that they value themselves.

336
00:19:10,454 --> 00:19:12,875
And for everyone to do that, they

337
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,976
need to feel that they're supported in their favored ways

338
00:19:16,976 --> 00:19:20,396
of working, that we can have a team structure where

339
00:19:20,396 --> 00:19:22,557
an engine coder and a gameplay designer

340
00:19:22,557 --> 00:19:25,337
both feel supported and able to grow.

341
00:19:27,194 --> 00:19:30,655
and we spent a bit of time trying to figure out how do we

342
00:19:30,655 --> 00:19:33,756
balance this out, how do we even understand why those people have

343
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:38,737
different needs and then how can we satisfy them. And we came up

344
00:19:38,737 --> 00:19:43,318
with this division of types of work. So across the horizontal

345
00:19:43,318 --> 00:19:46,839
axis you've got how well defined the problem is from very well

346
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:50,940
defined, clearly briefed all the way to who knows. And then on

347
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,980
the vertical axis you've got how well defined the solution is. So

348
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,941
is this an R&D project or is this something that

349
00:19:57,401 --> 00:20:00,722
you've done a thousand times before and it's about applying

350
00:20:00,722 --> 00:20:04,882
known solutions to it. And so we've come up with some names

351
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:08,483
for those types of work. So crafting is the process of

352
00:20:08,483 --> 00:20:11,364
taking a well-defined problem and applying a well-defined

353
00:20:11,364 --> 00:20:14,704
solution to it. So craft, craftspeople are really

354
00:20:14,704 --> 00:20:17,685
motivated by excellence of execution. These people will

355
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:21,446
take a brief for a bit of work and then give you the, they'll

356
00:20:21,446 --> 00:20:24,106
use their, their skills and their judgment to give you the

357
00:20:24,106 --> 00:20:26,887
best whatever it is that meets that brief.

358
00:20:28,008 --> 00:20:35,933
The next group is experts. Experts really like a well-defined problem that nobody has ever successfully solved before.

359
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:41,016
And they'll go away and do R&D and loads of hard sums and then come back to you with something amazing.

360
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:46,900
Then we have explorers. Explorers who really love uncertainty.

361
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:52,123
Who will take the brief of, it seems like jumping should be fun, right? Is jumping fun?

362
00:20:52,123 --> 00:20:55,065
Can you tell us how jumping fits into our game and why it's amazing?

363
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:59,847
and that's, you know, that's the explorer mentality. And then the

364
00:20:59,847 --> 00:21:04,467
last one is what we call connectors is folks who take

365
00:21:04,467 --> 00:21:07,708
well-defined solutions to problems that the team doesn't

366
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:10,769
know they have yet. So they're people who often talk to other

367
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,529
teams. And so when the team comes up with the idea of, yes,

368
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:16,770
we're going to try and put all of these badges into a box,

369
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,550
they'll say. You should probably go talk to Dave over there

370
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,111
because a few years ago he tried to put a load of badges into a

371
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:25,371
box and now Dave doesn't have a face. So maybe you want to learn

372
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:25,712
from Dave.

373
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:32,577
And the last big drive is purpose. So Dan Pink describes

374
00:21:32,577 --> 00:21:35,579
purpose as attaching your desires to something bigger than

375
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:38,662
yourself. And let's be honest, in the video game industry, the

376
00:21:38,662 --> 00:21:41,844
purpose is typically pretty obvious. I mean, really not many

377
00:21:41,844 --> 00:21:44,086
people are in this gig for the money, right? This is

378
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:46,568
borderline vocational, what we do, which is kick ass. A

379
00:21:46,568 --> 00:21:49,991
criterion we've actually tweaked and added a little bit more to

380
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:53,534
our purpose that actually makes it even more motivational for

381
00:21:53,534 --> 00:21:55,876
certainly for me and I know for a few other people in the

382
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:56,256
studio.

383
00:21:56,577 --> 00:22:00,958
which is we make incredible games in the best way we can. So

384
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:03,659
we explicitly care about the people in the process as well as

385
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:05,860
the product that we're ultimately building. And that

386
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,621
happily results in a better product as well as happier

387
00:22:08,621 --> 00:22:13,182
people. So that's pretty kick ass. So those are, those are the

388
00:22:13,182 --> 00:22:18,144
big ways that we treat people as talent. The other big thing we

389
00:22:18,144 --> 00:22:20,925
do is we actively eradicate harmful dogma.

390
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:25,760
and we just do this. I mean it's pretty simple. We don't do things because that's how they've

391
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,163
always been done. Every process and plan we have is just the best idea for it that we

392
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:35,906
have right now. Everything can always be challenged and we actively look for ways to get better.

393
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,393
One way we do that is that at the end of every milestone,

394
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:43,156
each feature team will run a post-mortem

395
00:22:43,156 --> 00:22:45,698
on the last milestone to understand how they can improve

396
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:46,298
for the next one.

397
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:49,101
And then the leadership team runs an aggregate post-mortem

398
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:52,684
to figure out what large areas the whole team can improve on

399
00:22:52,684 --> 00:22:54,285
for the next milestone.

400
00:22:55,738 --> 00:22:58,519
So hopefully that sounds lovely to you. It sounds lovely to me.

401
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:02,521
Um, does it actually work? I mean, this sounds kind of hippy

402
00:23:02,521 --> 00:23:06,322
and weird and like, I don't know. So, um, yes, of course it

403
00:23:06,322 --> 00:23:10,064
does work. Otherwise I wouldn't be here. Um, so the early signs

404
00:23:10,064 --> 00:23:13,105
were really good. By the end of 2014, we'd grown to be a team of

405
00:23:13,105 --> 00:23:16,206
like 25 to 30 people working on a new game franchise. And in

406
00:23:16,206 --> 00:23:19,087
terms of quantity and quality of what we were making, we were

407
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:21,448
more productive than any team I've ever worked with.

408
00:23:22,682 --> 00:23:26,264
we had executive reviews where the feedback was, I can't

409
00:23:26,264 --> 00:23:28,926
believe how much has gone in since the last time I reviewed

410
00:23:28,926 --> 00:23:31,168
this. I don't know if you've ever had an executive review. I

411
00:23:31,168 --> 00:23:33,850
certainly never had one where there was feedback like that

412
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:38,454
until recently. Prototyping on our new game was consistently

413
00:23:38,454 --> 00:23:40,736
turning out really fun new features that all worked

414
00:23:40,736 --> 00:23:44,418
together as well as hundreds or thousands probably that didn't

415
00:23:44,418 --> 00:23:46,940
that we all happily binned because we were able to make

416
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,441
those decisions as a studio.

417
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:52,869
And the other big thing is, within EA, every six months we

418
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:55,992
have a company-wide team health survey where everyone rates

419
00:23:55,992 --> 00:23:59,215
themselves on how confident they're feeling in the game

420
00:23:59,215 --> 00:24:01,437
they're making, how well supported they are in the

421
00:24:01,437 --> 00:24:05,140
studio. And Criterion's consistently been reporting the

422
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,803
highest levels of satisfaction, confidence and hope of any game

423
00:24:08,803 --> 00:24:11,545
team in EA. So I think we're totally hitting those two big

424
00:24:11,545 --> 00:24:14,208
pillars that we're aiming for. We're delivering great stuff and

425
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,248
we're doing it in a great way.

426
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:21,003
So that was the end of 2014 and then suddenly the old world came knocking. So we had a

427
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:26,526
request for help. We were asked whether we would be able to help another EA studio ship the

428
00:24:26,526 --> 00:24:31,569
best game they could which would involve committing a large chunk of our team to spend

429
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:36,431
nine months working on their game. And at first glance I've got to say we were quite fearful.

430
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:38,512
We were concerned that this would

431
00:24:39,638 --> 00:24:41,999
involve a return to a much more traditional form of game

432
00:24:41,999 --> 00:24:44,600
development, at least for that big part of our team. And

433
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,162
having seen such a promising new way of working starting up, we

434
00:24:48,162 --> 00:24:50,443
really didn't want that to happen. But we had a great

435
00:24:50,443 --> 00:24:52,844
conversation and with the support of the other team and

436
00:24:52,844 --> 00:24:55,305
with the A leadership, we managed to use this as an

437
00:24:55,305 --> 00:24:59,267
opportunity to try out our new highly autonomous way of working

438
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:00,487
in a production environment.

439
00:25:01,974 --> 00:25:04,856
to facilitate this we did build a very small interface layer to

440
00:25:04,856 --> 00:25:07,177
smooth over process bumps because the other team was

441
00:25:07,177 --> 00:25:10,419
obviously working in its standard way and, you know,

442
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:14,162
there was some jiggling needed to be done there but most of the

443
00:25:14,162 --> 00:25:17,964
criterion team was just working in our new way. And it totally

444
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:20,926
worked, right? So we built the cop experience for Need for Speed

445
00:25:20,926 --> 00:25:22,907
and we're really proud of what we delivered.

446
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:27,618
and we're even more proud of the way it was delivered. So despite zero overtime from the

447
00:25:27,618 --> 00:25:33,021
team, we delivered an experience that was repeatedly called out by reviewers as excellent.

448
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:38,985
The only times we really hit snags in our process were really places where our way of

449
00:25:38,985 --> 00:25:43,828
working butted up against the main team because they were scheduled in a more traditional

450
00:25:43,828 --> 00:25:48,892
way and weren't capable of fluidly moving their priorities as much as we needed.

451
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:53,650
And then it actually happened again before we were even done

452
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,790
with that engagement.

453
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:57,591
There was another EA studio who asked for help on a feature

454
00:25:57,591 --> 00:25:59,212
that they felt would benefit from some

455
00:25:59,212 --> 00:26:02,353
of our special criterion source.

456
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:03,814
So we took the same approach.

457
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:07,175
The need for speed thing was going pretty well.

458
00:26:07,175 --> 00:26:10,096
So we started working in our new highly autonomous way

459
00:26:10,096 --> 00:26:12,397
with a team that was all self-selected.

460
00:26:12,397 --> 00:26:14,838
And the team decided what to build and how to build it.

461
00:26:16,095 --> 00:26:18,418
And, yeah, that went pretty well, too. We delivered the

462
00:26:18,418 --> 00:26:22,061
speeder bikes for Star Wars Battlefront as well as some of

463
00:26:22,061 --> 00:26:25,645
the Endor speeder bike training mission. And the fans and the

464
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:28,588
critics loved that stuff. So there's this quote from Euro

465
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:31,390
Gamer that I really like. The two-minute thrill of an Endor

466
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:36,015
speeder bike chase is as pure a hit of Star Wars joy as we've

467
00:26:36,015 --> 00:26:39,458
had since Atari's legendary arcade side show in 1983. I feel

468
00:26:39,458 --> 00:26:39,999
pretty good about that.

469
00:26:40,666 --> 00:26:45,519
So once again we delivered that on time, on budget, without any overtime and with very

470
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:48,809
happy people both in our studio and with the main game studio.

471
00:26:50,146 --> 00:26:54,408
So since 2014, we've racked up 65 staff years of using this

472
00:26:54,408 --> 00:26:57,749
process in pre-production and 18 staff years, and actually both

473
00:26:57,749 --> 00:27:01,030
of these numbers are higher now, 18 staff years on titles that

474
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:05,091
have actually shipped. So we're pretty confident that this

475
00:27:05,091 --> 00:27:07,512
totally scales to AAA production, which is why I'm now

476
00:27:07,512 --> 00:27:09,433
comfortable standing here and talking to you about it. So

477
00:27:09,433 --> 00:27:11,914
how have we actually put this into practice?

478
00:27:20,693 --> 00:27:23,135
So we've experimented with a whole range of different time

479
00:27:23,135 --> 00:27:26,498
structures for working from completely free form chaos,

480
00:27:26,498 --> 00:27:30,281
which was fun but didn't really scale, to everybody swarming on

481
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:33,624
a single feature until it was done. And there were good sides

482
00:27:33,624 --> 00:27:37,067
and bad sides to both of those, but really we've actually ended

483
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:39,129
up coming back to something a lot more traditional with a

484
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:43,512
regular seven week cadence for milestones and then six weeks of

485
00:27:43,512 --> 00:27:45,974
that solid development with

486
00:27:47,453 --> 00:27:50,497
work chunked up as appropriate, right, depending on how the team's working. If

487
00:27:50,497 --> 00:27:53,580
they're working in a scrum style, then maybe that's three, three two-week

488
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,643
sprints. If they're working in an iteration style, then maybe that's one

489
00:27:56,643 --> 00:28:01,588
six-week block. That's totally up to the teams. But the big thing we've added is

490
00:28:01,588 --> 00:28:05,652
this big review and planning week between the milestones. And this is

491
00:28:05,652 --> 00:28:08,735
really our primary means for sharing context and pushing that out to

492
00:28:08,735 --> 00:28:09,136
everyone.

493
00:28:10,373 --> 00:28:12,715
So this starts off with a review of the previous milestone.

494
00:28:12,715 --> 00:28:14,437
The whole team comes together for this,

495
00:28:14,437 --> 00:28:16,840
and we all review the previous milestone,

496
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,363
and then we start looking at where the game backlog

497
00:28:19,363 --> 00:28:22,066
highlights some themes for where we should go

498
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:23,147
for the next milestone.

499
00:28:23,147 --> 00:28:25,970
Then individuals will join a major theme

500
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,973
to agree what can be achieved in that milestone,

501
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,975
paying careful attention to team viability.

502
00:28:32,122 --> 00:28:34,564
the teams then physically move all their desks together so we

503
00:28:34,564 --> 00:28:38,308
have a big chaotic 20 minutes of uh desk moving and then the

504
00:28:38,308 --> 00:28:41,352
feature teams spend the next six weeks sprinting towards uh

505
00:28:41,352 --> 00:28:45,096
the next deliverable with the reasonable cadence of

506
00:28:45,096 --> 00:28:46,718
intermediate reviews as appropriate.

507
00:28:48,555 --> 00:28:53,516
We also have a broadcast. This is a team meeting which happens on Fridays. Fridays are also

508
00:28:53,516 --> 00:28:57,737
our formal dress day for some of the team which is why this is our technical director

509
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:02,318
Christian Holmquist wearing a bow tie. This isn't normal attire in Criterion. But so every

510
00:29:02,318 --> 00:29:07,860
Friday afternoon we have a team meeting where any group that has something cool to show

511
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,201
gets the opportunity to stand up in front of the team and do it. There's no Q and A's.

512
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:13,522
It's not super intimidating.

513
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:16,163
It's a high energy celebration of the great things that have

514
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:19,444
happened that week. Aim to bring everyone along on the journey

515
00:29:19,444 --> 00:29:21,765
that the whole team's going on. And then actually talking about

516
00:29:21,765 --> 00:29:26,587
reviews. So historically in Criterion, I'm sure there will

517
00:29:26,587 --> 00:29:29,968
be some nodding on this point as well, software reviews have been

518
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:34,110
a very, very fraught experience. They've often ended up being

519
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,511
quite painful and actually quite ineffective as a result. But we

520
00:29:37,511 --> 00:29:41,313
know that software reviews are crucial to the success of making

521
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:41,833
a great game.

522
00:29:43,104 --> 00:29:46,487
So we set about figuring out how we'd make software reviews better.

523
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:50,031
I think there was another talk about this earlier, which I missed actually.

524
00:29:50,031 --> 00:29:54,835
But we came up with the concept that there are actually at least three different,

525
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,316
very different types of review.

526
00:29:56,316 --> 00:30:01,261
And if everyone goes into a review with the same understanding that this is what this review is for...

527
00:30:01,461 --> 00:30:04,883
then an awful lot of the, um, fractiousness goes away. So the

528
00:30:04,883 --> 00:30:07,765
first type of review is just an update review. We don't really

529
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:10,227
need any feedback from you. This is just so that you know where

530
00:30:10,227 --> 00:30:12,749
we've got to so you can talk to other people about how the

531
00:30:12,749 --> 00:30:15,590
journey's going and we'll get back together next week and show

532
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,853
you again then. The next type is a steering review. This is when

533
00:30:18,853 --> 00:30:22,835
the teams come to a point, a fork in the road and they really

534
00:30:22,835 --> 00:30:26,658
need some guidance from someone external to that team to really

535
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:26,938
say, okay,

536
00:30:27,921 --> 00:30:30,843
maybe we should go, should we go like deep on this one thing or

537
00:30:30,843 --> 00:30:33,425
should we try doing like another four examples of this and see

538
00:30:33,425 --> 00:30:36,848
what, what breadth looks like instead. And that's a, that's

539
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:41,272
great to have an external view onto, onto that. And then the

540
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:45,595
last one is a quality review. So this is the team saying we think

541
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:47,417
we're just about done on this feature. Like is this good

542
00:30:47,417 --> 00:30:49,699
enough? Should we stop investing in this? Should we stop working

543
00:30:49,699 --> 00:30:50,740
on this and move on right now?

544
00:30:51,931 --> 00:30:55,698
And so by starting every review with this is an update review,

545
00:30:55,698 --> 00:30:57,662
we don't need steering here, we just

546
00:30:57,662 --> 00:31:01,289
need you to know what we're doing, or whatever,

547
00:31:01,289 --> 00:31:03,594
then the reviews go way, way better.

548
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:09,129
So as I mentioned, we also have frequent retrospectives.

549
00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:14,091
And we've co-opted the agile start, stop, continue process,

550
00:31:14,091 --> 00:31:15,932
which is quite simple.

551
00:31:15,932 --> 00:31:18,893
Everyone in a group writes down the things that went bad

552
00:31:18,893 --> 00:31:21,714
and the things that went good in the last chunk of time.

553
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:23,855
Then the facilitator groups those

554
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:25,155
into themes that are related.

555
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:26,596
Maybe these ones are about communication.

556
00:31:26,596 --> 00:31:29,276
Maybe these ones are about some tech that we're using.

557
00:31:29,276 --> 00:31:31,197
And as they're sticking,

558
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:34,918
sticking the stickies to the wall. If anyone wants to discuss

559
00:31:34,918 --> 00:31:37,238
something, if something is contentious, they just shout

560
00:31:37,238 --> 00:31:40,879
flash and you draw a big old lightning bolt on it. And then

561
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:44,200
the team, once they're all up, then the team goes through and

562
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,161
discusses the flashed cards and agrees actions for the big

563
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:51,201
themes that have come out. So things we're going to start

564
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,782
doing because that will make it better. Things we're going to

565
00:31:53,782 --> 00:31:55,842
stop doing because that will make it better. Or things we're

566
00:31:55,842 --> 00:31:57,983
going to make sure we carry on doing because they're actually

567
00:31:57,983 --> 00:31:58,803
really working for us.

568
00:32:00,423 --> 00:32:03,705
And as I said, the, the, the twist we've taken on this is

569
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:06,667
that once the teams have done this, the production group then

570
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:09,408
does the same exact thing at a higher level with the outputs of

571
00:32:09,408 --> 00:32:13,951
their, um, of the, the, the team's start stop continues. And

572
00:32:13,951 --> 00:32:16,772
that allows us to come to the team and say, right, so for the

573
00:32:16,772 --> 00:32:20,414
next milestone, we're going to attack fixing this, this and

574
00:32:20,414 --> 00:32:23,596
this. Um, so the whole team can see that the process is

575
00:32:23,596 --> 00:32:26,257
continually improving and that, um, that we're really listening

576
00:32:26,257 --> 00:32:27,038
and making it better.

577
00:32:28,743 --> 00:32:32,470
So we have those retrospectives in the morning of the Monday of the planning week.

578
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:36,076
And then in the afternoon of the planning week, we found...

579
00:32:37,518 --> 00:32:40,379
it was pretty demotivational for the team to stand up. So we

580
00:32:40,379 --> 00:32:42,519
have a big team meeting to review the milestone. But we

581
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:46,520
found it quite demotivational for the teams after a morning of

582
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:52,002
critical self introspection to stand up and say, yeah, so we

583
00:32:52,002 --> 00:32:54,463
missed this goal because, well, it was really hard and Dave was

584
00:32:54,463 --> 00:32:57,183
sick. And, well, we missed this goal because of this unexpected

585
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,864
dependency. And, well, we kind of missed this goal just because

586
00:32:59,864 --> 00:33:01,265
we're terrible human beings.

587
00:33:01,725 --> 00:33:05,586
no one really liked that and actually we felt we'd already got all of the main

588
00:33:05,586 --> 00:33:09,428
learnings out in the morning. So instead what we have is a highly

589
00:33:09,428 --> 00:33:14,370
motivational celebration that we call the wall of awesome. So the feature

590
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:18,111
teams demo the great stuff they've done and then the big highlights they stick

591
00:33:18,111 --> 00:33:21,432
up on a wall and they get a big round of applause and the whole team gathers

592
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:26,014
around and it's all kick ass and it's way more motivational and also helps

593
00:33:26,014 --> 00:33:29,416
really sell the story of where the game's going. So everyone's really got a

594
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:30,456
good feel.

595
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:36,482
for how development is going. The next big thing we've really

596
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:41,365
changed is how the space is laid out in our office. And this

597
00:33:41,365 --> 00:33:47,289
really is to support the mastery phases, the mastery piece that I

598
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:49,891
mentioned earlier as much as anything. So we partnered with

599
00:33:49,891 --> 00:33:52,933
some workplace consultants to design an office space built

600
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:55,575
around the concepts of explorers, crafters and experts

601
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,917
and their different needs. And we came up with this idea of an

602
00:33:58,917 --> 00:33:59,998
interruption gradient.

603
00:34:00,847 --> 00:34:05,913
So explorers on the right, left, on this end, or that end,

604
00:34:05,913 --> 00:34:09,257
they really like chaos, right?

605
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:12,781
So the explorer teams embrace chaos and like lots and lots

606
00:34:12,781 --> 00:34:14,543
of stimulation and lots of new ideas

607
00:34:14,543 --> 00:34:18,729
because that helps them find fun in whatever they're working on

608
00:34:18,729 --> 00:34:21,031
and stops them getting drawn into little ruts.

609
00:34:22,522 --> 00:34:25,202
Then in the middle of the office we have the craft area. So

610
00:34:25,202 --> 00:34:27,323
these are the feature teams that have agreed, okay, right,

611
00:34:27,323 --> 00:34:29,944
these are the goals that we're working on. We're going to crack

612
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:32,364
on and just kind of, we'll collaborate tightly within

613
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:35,005
ourselves, but we don't need to talk too much to any other teams

614
00:34:35,005 --> 00:34:36,946
like we can just crack on for six weeks and that'd be fine.

615
00:34:36,946 --> 00:34:40,447
And then at the far end of the office are the experts who tend

616
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:44,068
to be much more lone wolf, mind palace type people who really,

617
00:34:44,068 --> 00:34:48,389
really hate being interrupted because it'll take them hours to

618
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:50,390
get back to the same state they were in before.

619
00:34:52,535 --> 00:34:56,599
And so here's a photo of the explorer to, um, craft area of

620
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:59,842
our office. And hopefully you can really see the difference

621
00:34:59,842 --> 00:35:04,086
just in this, uh, one picture. So on the left hand side of this

622
00:35:04,086 --> 00:35:06,789
picture, you've got the explorer area where everything's kind of

623
00:35:06,789 --> 00:35:08,971
chaotic, where we have, um,

624
00:35:09,352 --> 00:35:12,313
big two foot cubes that we build little meeting rooms out of as

625
00:35:12,313 --> 00:35:16,694
needed. We've got big open tables that are, that never have

626
00:35:16,694 --> 00:35:20,215
the same people sitting at them twice and lots of game playing,

627
00:35:20,215 --> 00:35:22,936
lots of music playing, lots of good stuff, lots of good

628
00:35:22,936 --> 00:35:27,738
distractions there. And then you can see as it moves to the right

629
00:35:27,738 --> 00:35:32,479
and the much more ordered groups of craft groups. So those are

630
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:35,400
the feature teams working, disappearing off around the

631
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:35,680
corner there.

632
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,531
And then in the foreground you can see the big kitchen table

633
00:35:38,531 --> 00:35:42,533
we've got. And we actually have a bunch of these big open tables

634
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:45,835
around in the office and we much prefer them to meeting rooms for

635
00:35:45,835 --> 00:35:46,735
almost every case.

636
00:35:48,692 --> 00:35:50,953
They're like meeting rooms in that a bunch of people can get

637
00:35:50,953 --> 00:35:53,836
around them and collaborate really effectively but have the

638
00:35:53,836 --> 00:35:56,638
huge advantage that they're super low friction to use. So if

639
00:35:56,638 --> 00:35:59,500
there's a couple of you sat at a desk talking about something

640
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,823
interesting and someone else wants to jump in, it's virtually

641
00:36:02,823 --> 00:36:05,045
no effort to stand up and walk over to one of these tables and

642
00:36:05,045 --> 00:36:08,408
maybe grab another person on the way past that you know will have

643
00:36:08,408 --> 00:36:10,970
some good input. You don't need to find a free room and then

644
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:14,733
check the calendars and send invites and all that jazz. You

645
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:16,775
just grab a table. There's enough around the office and

646
00:36:16,775 --> 00:36:18,316
they're cheap enough and easy enough to use.

647
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,852
Another big thing we've got is a number of people who work from

648
00:36:23,852 --> 00:36:27,494
home or work remotely for some or all of the time. And so we've

649
00:36:27,494 --> 00:36:30,515
invested in a bunch of tools to make that more effective. And

650
00:36:30,515 --> 00:36:33,396
the most obvious one is this, it's called a double robot,

651
00:36:33,396 --> 00:36:37,978
which is essentially like a mini Segway with an iPad on top. And

652
00:36:37,978 --> 00:36:41,259
it sounds like just a stupid toy, right? It sounds just

653
00:36:41,259 --> 00:36:44,540
ridiculously exorbitant, but it's really not. So when you,

654
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,741
if you've ever worked remotely, you can feel super

655
00:36:47,322 --> 00:36:50,863
isolated. You can feel super like you're hanging on the end of

656
00:36:50,863 --> 00:36:53,284
someone else's agenda, someone else's IM. You're just sat there

657
00:36:53,284 --> 00:36:56,205
waiting for someone to respond to you. And please, I'm totally

658
00:36:56,205 --> 00:36:58,846
blocked. I can't do anything until you answer this message.

659
00:36:58,846 --> 00:37:01,867
And so now you can just walk over to someone and say, dude,

660
00:37:01,867 --> 00:37:05,808
check your email. And it's amazing. Like, it's astonishing.

661
00:37:09,431 --> 00:37:14,013
So it used to take, um, three days and cost about $15,000 for

662
00:37:14,013 --> 00:37:17,715
us to rearrange our office. And because we've designed a way of

663
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:20,717
working where we need to consist, like, constantly, every

664
00:37:20,717 --> 00:37:23,678
few weeks, rearrange all the desks, that cost had to

665
00:37:23,678 --> 00:37:26,200
disappear or else it would have bankrupted us. So we're

666
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,540
inspired by Valve.

667
00:37:28,136 --> 00:37:32,360
obviously. So we developed mobile desks that required only

668
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,703
one power and one ethernet plug. For anyone who hasn't visited

669
00:37:35,703 --> 00:37:39,547
the UK, the thing at the bottom is a UK mains plug. They're

670
00:37:39,547 --> 00:37:43,551
designed to be more painful to the bare foot than Lego. And

671
00:37:43,551 --> 00:37:46,554
they'll have you down like a sack of potatoes. It's amazing.

672
00:37:46,554 --> 00:37:49,997
So we also have console dev kits in mini audio racks on wheels.

673
00:37:49,997 --> 00:37:52,900
So they can just wheel around the office as needed.

674
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:57,025
And then we have banks of power and network points in the floor

675
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,886
along sort of well-designed lines, which really helps that

676
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:04,388
craft area be kind of ordered and grouped and batched. And so

677
00:38:04,388 --> 00:38:06,409
now, as I said, we rearranged the whole office in under 20

678
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:10,251
minutes, and it's a very, very funny 20 minutes as well. Like,

679
00:38:10,251 --> 00:38:14,773
everyone loves that. And so the last thing we've built is we've

680
00:38:14,773 --> 00:38:18,494
gone back to school, and we've got a special cloakroom where

681
00:38:19,658 --> 00:38:22,680
that keeps a lot of clutter off the floor but it's also super

682
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,821
fun to come into the office in the morning and just hang out in

683
00:38:25,821 --> 00:38:28,823
the cloak room for a little bit and talk about what you were

684
00:38:28,823 --> 00:38:32,544
doing last night and that's super nice and actually makes a

685
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:35,466
surprising difference to how clean the office is. So to sum

686
00:38:35,466 --> 00:38:37,807
up then, how do you build a hyper engaged team? You treat

687
00:38:37,807 --> 00:38:42,309
people as talent. Realize you don't have resources, you have

688
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:45,550
talented individuals who just want to make the best game they

689
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:45,630
can.

690
00:38:46,655 --> 00:38:48,797
Give them all the context and the alignment you're able to,

691
00:38:48,797 --> 00:38:51,139
help them to set up those powerful, creative

692
00:38:51,139 --> 00:38:53,520
collaborations, and then just get the hell out of their way

693
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,382
and let them do amazing stuff.

694
00:38:55,382 --> 00:38:59,164
You use proven drives to motivate your team.

695
00:38:59,164 --> 00:39:01,546
Don't rely on management thinking from the 1960s.

696
00:39:01,546 --> 00:39:04,688
Use autonomy, mastery, and purpose

697
00:39:04,688 --> 00:39:06,830
that science knows really work.

698
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:09,171
And don't accept a harmful status quo.

699
00:39:09,171 --> 00:39:12,214
Actively seek ways to get better.

700
00:39:12,214 --> 00:39:14,815
Let your team tell you how they can be more effective

701
00:39:14,815 --> 00:39:15,476
and listen to them.

702
00:39:17,385 --> 00:39:20,106
don't accept any dogma and let everything be challengeable. So

703
00:39:20,106 --> 00:39:24,209
at Criterion we're now confident that we're building games in the

704
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:28,331
best way we've ever heard of. And we're actually hiring. So if

705
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:32,153
you want to come and work with us and hit up these URLs, we've

706
00:39:32,153 --> 00:39:34,254
got a few places open at the moment and we'll be opening a

707
00:39:34,254 --> 00:39:37,436
few more over the next few months. So that's everything.

708
00:39:37,436 --> 00:39:37,977
Thanks very much.

709
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:48,496
And are there any questions?

710
00:39:48,496 --> 00:39:54,543
Just one question to clarify. It was a great talk, thanks. And

711
00:39:54,543 --> 00:39:59,970
when you mentioned that you relocated people across the

712
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:05,156
space based on their type, how do you actually get their type?

713
00:40:05,156 --> 00:40:07,358
Do you test them or?

714
00:40:09,579 --> 00:40:12,284
Yes, so the question was how do we actually move people?

715
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:15,249
So this is literally we have wheels on the bottom of our desks.

716
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:20,718
I mean that, how do you determine that this guy is an explorer and this is an expert?

717
00:40:21,077 --> 00:40:24,480
I see. So this really comes down to the theme that they

718
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,183
subscribe to. So typically they will have a core tech theme and

719
00:40:29,183 --> 00:40:31,864
by and large the people in core tech will really want to be

720
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:36,488
experts. So typically the core tech team will just choose to

721
00:40:36,488 --> 00:40:40,851
locate themselves at the quiet end of the office. Yeah.

722
00:40:40,851 --> 00:40:42,031
Does that make sense?

723
00:40:42,492 --> 00:40:47,757
right? Yeah, there's like a big conversation because obviously you can't have everyone

724
00:40:47,757 --> 00:40:54,264
deciding on the same exact space so it's a bit of a negotiation but that's ultimately how it

725
00:40:54,264 --> 00:40:59,190
works is the teams choose how to make themselves as happy as possible. Great, thanks. Cheers.

726
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:03,801
I was wondering if you could say something more about supporting autonomous teams.

727
00:41:03,801 --> 00:41:06,923
I've been part of an organization that said,

728
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:10,005
go autonomy and put a group of people together they thought was a viable group

729
00:41:10,005 --> 00:41:15,348
and say go and come back six months later.

730
00:41:15,348 --> 00:41:19,331
And not really support the team during that time.

731
00:41:19,331 --> 00:41:21,853
And so I heard you have DDs as process experts.

732
00:41:21,853 --> 00:41:23,774
I don't know if that's throughout the entire.

733
00:41:24,635 --> 00:41:31,367
process, but what support do you see as necessary for an autonomous team so that not the idea

734
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:35,133
that they can just go off in a corner and succeed by themselves?

735
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,800
Yeah. So that's a great question. So really you mentioned

736
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,221
teams going off for six months at a time and I think that's

737
00:41:42,221 --> 00:41:46,363
too long. So context will change and fade within a couple of

738
00:41:46,363 --> 00:41:48,644
months. So you really need to bring the whole team back

739
00:41:48,644 --> 00:41:52,306
together far more frequently than once every six months. And

740
00:41:52,306 --> 00:41:55,667
the other part is absolutely the DD, the process coach, stays

741
00:41:55,667 --> 00:41:58,729
with them the whole way through the process until the end of

742
00:41:58,729 --> 00:41:59,329
the milestone.

743
00:42:01,505 --> 00:42:02,625
Hey, I've got two questions.

744
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:06,288
One, when you have multiple autonomous teams

745
00:42:06,288 --> 00:42:08,689
that are working together, have you run into difficulties

746
00:42:08,689 --> 00:42:11,551
with all of them aligning on the overall project?

747
00:42:11,551 --> 00:42:12,712
Like you potentially have two teams

748
00:42:12,712 --> 00:42:14,112
that are doing great work,

749
00:42:14,112 --> 00:42:16,334
but they're in different directions

750
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:17,514
and aren't gonna overlap.

751
00:42:17,514 --> 00:42:19,776
And my second question is,

752
00:42:19,776 --> 00:42:24,219
what do you end up doing when an autonomous team is failing?

753
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:25,980
Like have you ever had to have a situation

754
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,921
where you have to actually stop an autonomous team

755
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:28,621
or break it up or give?

756
00:42:29,223 --> 00:42:31,698
Stronger direction to the team in order to help them succeed

757
00:42:32,977 --> 00:42:35,359
Yes, right, so, trying to remember your first question.

758
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:36,419
Aligning multiple...

759
00:42:36,419 --> 00:42:39,721
Right, yes, so that really is, you're absolutely right,

760
00:42:39,721 --> 00:42:41,542
we've absolutely had that problem.

761
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:45,024
So when we first started,

762
00:42:45,024 --> 00:42:47,445
we didn't give much guidance to the team at all.

763
00:42:47,445 --> 00:42:50,247
We'd have constant shares and constant discussions

764
00:42:50,247 --> 00:42:51,967
about the design of the game,

765
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:54,229
but really it was not everyone came to those,

766
00:42:54,229 --> 00:42:55,709
not everyone was involved.

767
00:42:55,709 --> 00:42:58,631
And we did find people would diverge an awful lot,

768
00:42:58,631 --> 00:42:59,371
like you say, you'd have...

769
00:42:59,572 --> 00:43:03,418
everyone's doing great stuff but it's all different great stuff and we found that started

770
00:43:03,418 --> 00:43:07,745
happening after about a dozen people. And I don't know if there's something around that

771
00:43:07,745 --> 00:43:13,034
number where a dozen people do too much work for you to just absorb what they're all doing.

772
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:19,442
So we have the broadcast every week for that reason and we have

773
00:43:19,442 --> 00:43:24,064
constant big team wide shares actually. So one of the other

774
00:43:24,064 --> 00:43:28,666
things I didn't touch on is several times a week there will

775
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:32,227
be like an hour long slot where someone will present like okay

776
00:43:32,227 --> 00:43:35,688
this is the new design for this vehicle or this part of the

777
00:43:35,688 --> 00:43:39,510
game or whatever. So we try to actively

778
00:43:40,628 --> 00:43:44,830
keep teams more aligned the whole way through. And we found that the balance we've got at

779
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:49,832
the moment really doesn't result in that divergence anymore. So we feel like we've got that one

780
00:43:49,832 --> 00:43:53,834
nailed. The other one was about teams that are failing. And we absolutely have had that

781
00:43:53,834 --> 00:44:00,496
case a few times, and that's always been because the team wasn't viable. So either they signed

782
00:44:00,496 --> 00:44:07,079
up to unrealistic goals or they didn't have the right skills to meet the goals. And, um,

783
00:44:07,287 --> 00:44:11,228
it always takes longer than you'd hope to recognize that that's the case, but still,

784
00:44:11,228 --> 00:44:14,969
hey, we're all human beings, you know, it's not like anyone's perfect, but as soon as you

785
00:44:14,969 --> 00:44:19,931
notice that, you can catch it in those terms, right, of, hey, that, your team doesn't look

786
00:44:19,931 --> 00:44:23,072
like it's viable, right, and the team kind of knows it's not succeeding, so.

787
00:44:24,074 --> 00:44:28,838
it's not like you're terrible people for not doing this better. It's like, hey, you

788
00:44:28,838 --> 00:44:32,982
aren't able to succeed at this, so what can we do to help? And we've had a few cases

789
00:44:32,982 --> 00:44:37,906
where we've recognized that, oh, well, you obviously need a couple of engineers in

790
00:44:37,906 --> 00:44:42,650
here to help you prove is that part of what you're working on or maybe you're

791
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:46,093
missing 2D art design or maybe actually what we need to do is have a big, um,

792
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:52,328
serious like two hour review of the work you've done and figure

793
00:44:52,328 --> 00:44:59,349
out the direction for you to progress in the next part of the

794
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:03,210
milestone. Cool. Okay, cool. Thanks. Are there any tools you

795
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:07,211
use to manage project wide high level tracking and

796
00:45:07,211 --> 00:45:11,752
predictability? Yes. So predictability is interesting.

797
00:45:11,752 --> 00:45:13,772
We've been talking about it quite a bit recently.

798
00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:18,411
I'm confident in predicting based on our past performance

799
00:45:18,411 --> 00:45:21,793
that we can deliver something kick ass at certain points.

800
00:45:21,793 --> 00:45:24,734
What I can't tell you is exactly what will be in it

801
00:45:24,734 --> 00:45:27,415
because the team needs to figure that out along the way.

802
00:45:27,415 --> 00:45:30,616
And so that can be a bit of a gnarly thing

803
00:45:30,616 --> 00:45:32,256
and we need to work with that.

804
00:45:32,256 --> 00:45:36,238
And that's just constant conversations.

805
00:45:36,238 --> 00:45:37,798
We do actually use roadmaps.

806
00:45:37,798 --> 00:45:40,039
So the team, and it's the team that

807
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:41,039
comes up with the roadmaps.

808
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:43,780
It's not us driving it.

809
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:46,721
but we do have roadmaps to figure out, okay, well,

810
00:45:46,721 --> 00:45:48,783
we know we need to be releasing something

811
00:45:48,783 --> 00:45:52,225
at this point in time, so let's have a talk

812
00:45:52,225 --> 00:45:54,727
about what's reasonable to expect to get in there

813
00:45:54,727 --> 00:45:57,449
and to align across different teams.

814
00:45:57,449 --> 00:45:58,910
We don't have any specific,

815
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:00,992
it's not like I have a silver bullet tool.

816
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:03,334
It's basically a big bag of conversation

817
00:46:03,334 --> 00:46:05,035
and alignment that we use.

818
00:46:05,035 --> 00:46:06,716
Thank you.

819
00:46:06,716 --> 00:46:06,797
Cool.

820
00:46:08,595 --> 00:46:10,975
Hi Alex, thanks so much.

821
00:46:10,975 --> 00:46:12,696
My question is around scalability

822
00:46:12,696 --> 00:46:15,097
along the two dimensions of size,

823
00:46:15,097 --> 00:46:18,057
so how many people you have, and complexity,

824
00:46:18,057 --> 00:46:19,898
how many things you're juggling.

825
00:46:19,898 --> 00:46:21,998
And the first part is looking back,

826
00:46:21,998 --> 00:46:24,139
what were the inflection points

827
00:46:24,139 --> 00:46:26,020
where you really needed to adjust your approach

828
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:29,561
because it was breaking, and then projecting forward?

829
00:46:31,282 --> 00:46:35,849
Is there a limit that you hit and this will break down,

830
00:46:35,849 --> 00:46:38,333
like when you outgrow the space or what not,

831
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:40,857
you're hiring, until when will you hire?

832
00:46:40,857 --> 00:46:43,481
Is this forever or are you going to cut your size?

833
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:47,673
So, yeah, it's a great question, is how scalable is this?

834
00:46:47,673 --> 00:46:49,715
So we've spoken about this quite a bit.

835
00:46:49,715 --> 00:46:52,837
So we hit a big inflection point at about a dozen people,

836
00:46:52,837 --> 00:46:56,499
for sure, which, as I say, I think that's probably about,

837
00:46:56,499 --> 00:46:58,461
if you've got more than a dozen people,

838
00:46:58,461 --> 00:46:59,882
you can't all sit around one table,

839
00:46:59,882 --> 00:47:01,803
you can't all keep up to date for free

840
00:47:01,803 --> 00:47:03,464
with what everyone else is doing.

841
00:47:03,464 --> 00:47:05,325
The next big inflection point

842
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:06,967
was kind of around 25 to 30 people.

843
00:47:08,423 --> 00:47:15,612
And that was the point at which we needed to start identifying teams as a production group.

844
00:47:15,612 --> 00:47:23,962
So, less than 30 people, we were able to share enough good context that the team could just make the right calls about what they should be working on.

845
00:47:23,962 --> 00:47:27,066
But going beyond that, we needed to do that.

846
00:47:28,822 --> 00:47:31,744
going towards the future, like, we don't actually want to grow

847
00:47:31,744 --> 00:47:35,386
to be a huge team. We don't, because we all like being on a

848
00:47:35,386 --> 00:47:38,468
team where you know everyone. That's, it's a super nice thing.

849
00:47:38,468 --> 00:47:41,390
And I think as we've showed with the Need for Speed work and

850
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:43,912
with the White Shark work, actually what you can do very

851
00:47:43,912 --> 00:47:46,734
effectively is effectively subcontract out a chunk of your

852
00:47:46,734 --> 00:47:48,536
game. So I think if we needed to scale

853
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:52,536
beyond a point when it got comfortable in our space,

854
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,796
what we'd do is we would have a second team

855
00:47:54,796 --> 00:47:56,957
in a second space working in a way that they wanted to,

856
00:47:56,957 --> 00:48:00,197
which would hopefully be similar to the way that we work,

857
00:48:00,197 --> 00:48:02,478
and then feed the two together.

858
00:48:02,478 --> 00:48:03,318
All right, thank you, sir.

859
00:48:03,318 --> 00:48:04,378
Thank you.

860
00:48:04,378 --> 00:48:06,918
So my question's about prioritization.

861
00:48:06,918 --> 00:48:08,979
I mean, if you give your teams complete freedom

862
00:48:08,979 --> 00:48:10,479
and autonomy, like, how do you know

863
00:48:10,479 --> 00:48:12,419
they're not chasing shiny objects, you know?

864
00:48:12,419 --> 00:48:14,460
They're already working on the textures of the wheels

865
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,440
before they've really even built the engine of the car,

866
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,240
you know, that kind of thing?

867
00:48:17,682 --> 00:48:23,685
It happens a lot on my team, so I'm just curious how do you keep them working on the right things?

868
00:48:23,685 --> 00:48:26,607
Yeah, that is a great question.

869
00:48:26,607 --> 00:48:34,191
Interestingly, I think we've had fewer problems like that since we've gone more autonomous

870
00:48:34,191 --> 00:48:37,053
than when we were less, and I think that's...

871
00:48:37,371 --> 00:48:42,036
partly it comes down to the bigger context, right? Because the decisions that people are

872
00:48:42,036 --> 00:48:47,901
making when they're spending too long on shiny wheels is just a bad decision. But then maybe

873
00:48:47,901 --> 00:48:52,506
they don't have the bigger context of, dude, you've got like 200 other cars to make. I mean,

874
00:48:52,506 --> 00:48:58,672
that wheel is good enough at this point. And so sharing that context constantly is a big help.

875
00:48:58,672 --> 00:49:02,015
But I think also, I don't know, it seems to be the

876
00:49:03,305 --> 00:49:07,446
people take on, so if you are told you're making a car, you

877
00:49:07,446 --> 00:49:11,968
have less ownership over making that car than if you're asked,

878
00:49:11,968 --> 00:49:16,429
hey, we need to make some cars. And you then say, oh, I could

879
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:20,130
probably make a car. So my question is more of like, let's

880
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,231
say we're making a car racing game. You guys make car racing

881
00:49:22,231 --> 00:49:26,092
games. How do you make sure that they're starting at the right

882
00:49:26,092 --> 00:49:29,674
spot, just priority wise in general? Step one, we should

883
00:49:29,674 --> 00:49:32,495
probably make X, Y, or Z, you know what I mean?

884
00:49:32,995 --> 00:49:35,558
are those just constant communications you guys have as a team?

885
00:49:35,558 --> 00:49:36,439
Pretty much.

886
00:49:36,439 --> 00:49:40,022
You're just talking about context and making sure we're just aware of what we're trying to do

887
00:49:40,022 --> 00:49:42,945
and I guess there's conversations that break out of that of,

888
00:49:42,945 --> 00:49:46,028
you know, like, well maybe this makes sense for us to do first, you know?

889
00:49:46,028 --> 00:49:48,410
Yeah, exactly. I mean, so I remember at the start of the...

890
00:49:49,128 --> 00:49:53,831
the need for speed work, what happened, we got some really great creative direction from

891
00:49:53,831 --> 00:49:58,973
um the main team from Ghost and we then got the whole team, the, you know, engineers,

892
00:49:58,973 --> 00:50:03,716
designers, um, me and other people, that's not like I do any work right, so, but we got

893
00:50:03,716 --> 00:50:04,357
the whole team.

894
00:50:04,737 --> 00:50:09,721
around one table and we sat down and we planned out on like little cards and all sorts

895
00:50:09,721 --> 00:50:14,145
actually what's the story of a cop chase, how does this work, how does this all come together

896
00:50:14,145 --> 00:50:19,609
and because everyone was there, everyone totally just got, oh okay right so that means this thing's

897
00:50:19,609 --> 00:50:23,132
important and this thing's important and obviously these things are relatively, you know, more

898
00:50:23,132 --> 00:50:24,393
important than these things.

899
00:50:24,393 --> 00:50:29,697
That makes sense, yeah. It just sounds like you guys communicate a lot more which is great anyway.

900
00:50:29,697 --> 00:50:30,818
So, thanks, it was a great talk.

901
00:50:30,818 --> 00:50:31,559
Cool, thank you.

902
00:50:33,669 --> 00:50:41,052
I'm curious, it sounds awesome, I'm curious how and maybe if you could gel this with a

903
00:50:41,052 --> 00:50:46,034
traditional like work for hire or publisher relationship where you're having to design

904
00:50:46,034 --> 00:50:51,356
to spec or come up with features and commit to features ahead of any of the development

905
00:50:51,356 --> 00:50:51,756
on those things.

906
00:50:51,756 --> 00:50:56,838
Yeah, I mean, so we did, it's a fine question for sure.

907
00:50:58,038 --> 00:51:02,587
I'm fully aware that I'm, that Criterion are actually very lucky that we were in this

908
00:51:02,587 --> 00:51:07,156
position to be able to do this, first of all. Certainly I think

909
00:51:08,145 --> 00:51:12,087
not every team is as lucky as that and some teams will, won't

910
00:51:12,087 --> 00:51:15,728
be able to go as full autonomy as we've gone. That said, I

911
00:51:15,728 --> 00:51:19,530
think, I suspect most teams could be more autonomous than

912
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:23,572
they currently are, certainly in my experience. So there are

913
00:51:23,572 --> 00:51:27,014
within, I was careful to put on the slide about autonomy within

914
00:51:27,014 --> 00:51:30,076
project parameters. So perhaps if you're working to spec, your

915
00:51:30,076 --> 00:51:33,217
project parameters are, well, we have to deliver all of these

916
00:51:33,217 --> 00:51:34,198
things by this date.

917
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:38,004
but then it's up to the team to figure out how we deliver all

918
00:51:38,004 --> 00:51:43,896
those things and who delivers what bits of those things. Does

919
00:51:43,896 --> 00:51:45,198
that answer your question?

920
00:51:45,198 --> 00:51:46,361
Cool, thank you.

921
00:51:47,506 --> 00:51:54,229
I would like to ask if you've ever approached a person who was overwhelmed by the autonomy.

922
00:51:54,229 --> 00:52:01,733
Maybe a junior person on the team, they're excited at first, but in the middle of the milestone,

923
00:52:01,733 --> 00:52:07,636
they realize they don't have enough experience, maybe scared to screw something.

924
00:52:07,636 --> 00:52:13,239
Yeah, I mean that, so, has that happened? I think that's, I can't think of a specific example.

925
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:15,220
I'm sure that's happened.

926
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:15,800
So we have...

927
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:21,550
whatever way you're working pretty much, you'll have a daily

928
00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:24,171
catch up with the rest of the people on your feature team. And

929
00:52:24,171 --> 00:52:26,652
our feature teams, so our DDs are very supportive and will

930
00:52:26,652 --> 00:52:29,433
notice that kind of thing happening. But our feature teams

931
00:52:29,433 --> 00:52:34,075
are also very supportive so a lot of the time it won't even be

932
00:52:34,075 --> 00:52:37,317
that person kind of freaking out and retracting a little bit.

933
00:52:37,317 --> 00:52:39,998
It'll be someone else saying, hey, do you want a hand with

934
00:52:39,998 --> 00:52:44,200
that? I've got some cool ideas. Which is, yeah, I think that.

935
00:52:44,948 --> 00:52:50,512
thinking about junior people that are not used to your system.

936
00:52:50,512 --> 00:52:54,554
Yeah. So the junior people need to be working amongst more

937
00:52:54,554 --> 00:52:59,978
experienced people, right? So the more experienced people are

938
00:52:59,978 --> 00:53:02,760
typically good at supporting the junior people and saying, hey,

939
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,241
it looks like maybe that's not going so great. Do you want a

940
00:53:05,241 --> 00:53:07,943
hand? Cool. Hi. Great talk.

941
00:53:08,244 --> 00:53:12,567
I was wondering if you had any experience trying to go faster

942
00:53:12,567 --> 00:53:17,309
with this process. I work with a mobile team with 20 people and a

943
00:53:17,309 --> 00:53:21,492
seven week sprint is a beautiful luxury. That's like seven live

944
00:53:21,492 --> 00:53:24,794
pushes for us. Have you had success doing this with a

945
00:53:24,794 --> 00:53:27,996
smaller time scale? Yes. So not with a team of this scale. But

946
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:34,800
when we were a team of a dozen people, what we would actually

947
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,521
do would be we'd have...

948
00:53:37,571 --> 00:53:39,793
the whole thing compressed down to maybe

949
00:53:39,793 --> 00:53:42,775
three or four of that whole cycle within one day

950
00:53:42,775 --> 00:53:46,058
so we'd have maybe three big build reviews a day

951
00:53:46,058 --> 00:53:48,620
and then everyone would leave the build review with

952
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,521
notes, okay I'm gonna fix this, I'm gonna fix this

953
00:53:50,521 --> 00:53:53,303
and then come back and a few hours later we'd go again

954
00:53:53,303 --> 00:53:56,366
and that worked really well, we were flying at that point

955
00:53:56,366 --> 00:54:00,109
but it just unfortunately didn't scale to bigger projects

956
00:54:00,109 --> 00:54:02,290
like bigger teams and bigger time scales

957
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:04,272
so we had to put more structure in, but yeah.

958
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:06,110
try it out.

959
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:06,230
Cool.

960
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:10,775
My question is almost identical, just where do you put the pressure of the time schedule?

961
00:54:10,775 --> 00:54:14,019
Does that stay with your leadership or does that actually go straight down as just a parameter

962
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:14,620
for the autonomous teams?

963
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:15,201
It's just a parameter.

964
00:54:15,201 --> 00:54:15,701
So we've actually...

965
00:54:15,701 --> 00:54:15,941
I'm sorry.

966
00:54:15,941 --> 00:54:16,162
I'm sorry.

967
00:54:16,162 --> 00:54:16,362
I'm sorry.

968
00:54:16,362 --> 00:54:16,602
I'm sorry.

969
00:54:16,602 --> 00:54:16,963
I'm sorry.

970
00:54:16,963 --> 00:54:17,283
I'm sorry.

971
00:54:17,283 --> 00:54:17,503
I'm sorry.

972
00:54:17,503 --> 00:54:17,724
I'm sorry.

973
00:54:17,724 --> 00:54:18,044
I'm sorry.

974
00:54:18,044 --> 00:54:18,304
I'm sorry.

975
00:54:18,304 --> 00:54:18,645
I'm sorry.

976
00:54:18,645 --> 00:54:18,965
I'm sorry.

977
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:19,286
I'm sorry.

978
00:54:19,286 --> 00:54:19,546
I'm sorry.

979
00:54:19,546 --> 00:54:20,046
I'm sorry.

980
00:54:20,865 --> 00:54:24,027
something I didn't mention is we've really recognized that

981
00:54:24,027 --> 00:54:30,111
there is a crucial difference between state targets and date

982
00:54:30,111 --> 00:54:34,473
targets. So date targets tend to be immovable, but what you're

983
00:54:34,473 --> 00:54:38,116
releasing on that date is typically movable, whereas state

984
00:54:38,116 --> 00:54:41,878
targets is a vision for your software that you need to get to

985
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:44,960
for it to feel like you want your game to feel like.

986
00:54:45,769 --> 00:54:49,013
and you just have to be comfortable that those two things are different so

987
00:54:49,013 --> 00:54:52,837
what goes in a release is more or less of what you meant to put in that release

988
00:54:52,837 --> 00:54:57,702
and sometimes you have to be flexible and change stuff around.

989
00:54:59,148 --> 00:55:06,710
Hi, you've got quite a big team and I've seen it was an interesting way of just dividing everybody by space and their working mode

990
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:10,031
That's a really good idea actually to implement. How did you do that?

991
00:55:10,031 --> 00:55:17,554
How did you define the personality types of your teams and how much time did it take you to define that and put it in action?

992
00:55:17,554 --> 00:55:19,775
So we actually we've never

993
00:55:21,419 --> 00:55:24,221
So we had the conversation where we came up with that grid and

994
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:27,143
that perhaps took like a week of conversation between lots of

995
00:55:27,143 --> 00:55:30,745
people, you know, over the course of a week to agree that

996
00:55:30,745 --> 00:55:32,986
this actually made sense and everyone kind of fitted in it

997
00:55:32,986 --> 00:55:38,330
somewhere. We've never done like an official, hey, you're that

998
00:55:38,330 --> 00:55:42,012
kind of person, you're that kind of person. But because the teams

999
00:55:42,012 --> 00:55:46,295
choose roughly where they want to sit and they choose the way

1000
00:55:46,295 --> 00:55:49,197
that they want to work, it's kind of as a

1001
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:56,716
I think that what we need to do as studio leads is make everyone

1002
00:55:56,716 --> 00:56:00,418
feel comfortable that, hey, yeah, so if you're an expert,

1003
00:56:00,418 --> 00:56:03,339
right, if you really want well-defined problems where

1004
00:56:03,339 --> 00:56:05,319
we're not going to change the design on you all over the

1005
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:09,041
place and where it's really R&D work, that's cool and you can

1006
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:10,841
succeed. And also if you're...

1007
00:56:12,122 --> 00:56:17,384
if you just want to go play in a big open space and then kick out amazing bits that are fun,

1008
00:56:17,384 --> 00:56:23,427
then that's cool as well. And so I think because we're explicitly saying that that's all cool

1009
00:56:23,427 --> 00:56:28,709
and we've got this rough rule that the office runs like this from highest interruption to least

1010
00:56:28,709 --> 00:56:32,771
interruption, like the team just does the rest.

1011
00:56:32,771 --> 00:56:32,971
Thanks.

1012
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,402
I realized that I was thinking of your crafters

1013
00:56:40,402 --> 00:56:42,424
and your experts just in terms of engineering.

1014
00:56:42,424 --> 00:56:45,667
I was wondering, there's QA, there's art.

1015
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:48,790
So I was wondering if all the work, or how much of the work,

1016
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,551
fits within this team context.

1017
00:56:51,673 --> 00:56:55,274
amount. Sorry. Yeah. Design, QA, art. This is actually my bad.

1018
00:56:55,274 --> 00:57:01,796
So I noticed this week from some other talks that not every

1019
00:57:01,796 --> 00:57:07,797
studio is as cross discipline as us. We're just crazy cross

1020
00:57:07,797 --> 00:57:10,978
discipline. So each one of our feature teams will be composed

1021
00:57:10,978 --> 00:57:15,459
of whatever needs to be composed of. So maybe that's a designer,

1022
00:57:15,459 --> 00:57:17,839
maybe that's an artist, maybe there's an audio engineer, maybe

1023
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:21,520
there's QA, maybe there's whatever. Right? So.

1024
00:57:21,981 --> 00:57:25,543
have all of those skills on the team and the people will

1025
00:57:25,543 --> 00:57:28,905
subscribe to a feature team. So we've got a, like a vehicles

1026
00:57:28,905 --> 00:57:35,609
team that has a couple of vehicle designers and then an

1027
00:57:35,609 --> 00:57:38,451
implementing vehicle designer and then a couple of hard core

1028
00:57:38,451 --> 00:57:42,433
physics engineers and like an audio engineer and a producer

1029
00:57:42,433 --> 00:57:47,056
and a DD and QA on it. So they are really, really well

1030
00:57:47,056 --> 00:57:49,718
self-contained feature teams and that's really important for them

1031
00:57:49,718 --> 00:57:50,638
to be viable and succeed.

1032
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:59,010
Having worked with something else like this, one of the problems we ran into was, for example,

1033
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:07,075
audio. We don't have many audio people. And so a lot of features would have leftover bits. How

1034
00:58:07,075 --> 00:58:12,118
do you guys kind of pull together those leftover parts? Like a feature might be complete but

1035
00:58:12,118 --> 00:58:17,842
it doesn't have audio. And how do you keep from stretching one person too thin across

1036
00:58:17,842 --> 00:58:18,522
multiple teams?

1037
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:21,853
Yeah, and so that's where, that's a great question.

1038
00:58:21,853 --> 00:58:24,016
We also don't have many audio people,

1039
00:58:24,016 --> 00:58:28,040
and I think we're hiring at the moment

1040
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,862
for an audio designer, so.

1041
00:58:29,862 --> 00:58:31,464
Oh yeah, we only have one animators as well.

1042
00:58:31,464 --> 00:58:33,466
Yeah, we're hiring for more of those.

1043
00:58:33,466 --> 00:58:35,448
But so we absolutely have that same problem.

1044
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:43,082
really that comes down to making the teams viable and as I said there's two

1045
00:58:43,082 --> 00:58:45,983
ways to do that so one is to change the skill sets

1046
00:58:45,983 --> 00:58:49,724
so one is to add more skills and you can't do that past a certain point like

1047
00:58:49,724 --> 00:58:51,585
you say if you've only got one audio

1048
00:58:51,585 --> 00:58:53,506
engineer you've only got one audio engineer

1049
00:58:54,557 --> 00:58:57,979
We do sometimes split one audio engineer across multiple

1050
00:58:57,979 --> 00:59:00,661
feature teams. Like people do drift between teams. As I say

1051
00:59:00,661 --> 00:59:04,023
the teams don't necessarily stay together for the whole time.

1052
00:59:04,023 --> 00:59:07,286
They do drift around. But the other thing you do is you just

1053
00:59:07,286 --> 00:59:10,948
change the goals. So you accept that, hey, so do you know what,

1054
00:59:10,948 --> 00:59:15,651
this time we won't get, we'll get to good handling feedback on

1055
00:59:15,651 --> 00:59:18,453
this thing but we won't have the audio pass yet. And the next

1056
00:59:18,453 --> 00:59:21,935
milestone we'll make sure that we've got the audio pass ready.

1057
00:59:22,651 --> 00:59:27,432
And so that becomes a question for producers to kind of wrangle

1058
00:59:27,432 --> 00:59:30,633
with and work with those dependencies and talk to

1059
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:33,134
actually the audio designers and say, hey, so what do you think

1060
00:59:33,134 --> 00:59:39,596
is the highest priority to deliver? Yeah, that's true as

1061
00:59:39,596 --> 00:59:44,517
well. So we have, as we get to a release, we'll have a chunk of

1062
00:59:44,517 --> 00:59:47,718
time set aside for hardening. And that's much more iterative,

1063
00:59:47,718 --> 00:59:51,199
much more less blocked out. So all of those little pickups will

1064
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:52,079
get picked up then.

1065
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:55,779
the hardening. Is that like a polish? Yeah, polish or

1066
00:59:55,779 --> 00:59:57,842
hardening or whatever you want to call it. Yeah. Cheers. Okay,

1067
00:59:57,842 --> 01:00:03,067
it looks like that's all the questions and I think I'm about

1068
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:06,951
out of time anyway. So I'll be over in the wrap up area just

1069
01:00:06,951 --> 01:00:09,834
around the corner for the next little while with some other

1070
01:00:09,834 --> 01:00:12,677
criterion folks if you want to talk to us about anything you've

1071
01:00:12,677 --> 01:00:14,119
heard. Here. Thanks very much.
