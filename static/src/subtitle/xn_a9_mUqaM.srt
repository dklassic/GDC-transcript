Hi, I'm John Manning, and at the Independent Game Summit at GDC 2017, I'm going to be talking

2
00:00:05,911 --> 00:00:09,473
about how we made the development process for Night in the Woods better through open

3
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:10,693
sourcing part of the game's code.

4
00:00:11,914 --> 00:00:15,315
Almost every game in development makes use of some kind of open source code.

5
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,477
It's freely available, and it solves a problem.

6
00:00:18,077 --> 00:00:22,459
However, while many projects are consumers of code, it's rarer to see a game release

7
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:22,799
code.

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,362
The best reason for releasing is that, when done right, you can leverage the skills of

9
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:30,203
volunteers who contribute back, and make your production easier.

10
00:00:31,327 --> 00:00:35,190
In this talk, we'll discuss how Night in the Woods open-sourced Yarn, its dialogue engine,

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,053
and how randoms on the internet took it, improved it way beyond the original feature set, and

12
00:00:39,093 --> 00:00:43,036
made more things possible for both the original development team and for many new projects.

13
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:47,979
We'll also discuss how to choose what parts of your code to release, how to release code

14
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:51,622
in a way that encourages others to contribute, how to manage an open-source project to get

15
00:00:51,642 --> 00:00:55,304
the most out of community contributions, and how to minimize the overhead that's involved.

16
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:57,426
I look forward to seeing you there.
