00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,962
Hello, and thank you for attending this presentation,

2
00:00:10,142 --> 00:00:11,924
What Wikipedia Doesn't Know Can Hurt You,

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:13,585
Writer Research Skills.

4
00:00:14,686 --> 00:00:16,367
So a little bit about who I am.

5
00:00:17,248 --> 00:00:18,108
My name's Chris Hepler.

6
00:00:18,229 --> 00:00:20,590
I've been writing professionally since the 1990s

7
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:22,352
when I first got published in the field

8
00:00:22,372 --> 00:00:23,553
of tabletop role-playing games.

9
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:26,095
I then tried my hand at television

10
00:00:26,175 --> 00:00:28,256
for a CBS show called The Agency.

11
00:00:29,037 --> 00:00:30,979
I then worked at Bioware on projects such as

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,061
Star Wars The Old Republic and Mass Effect 2 and 3.

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,031
Since then, I've been working for story-based mobile games.

14
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:40,132
First at a company called Fable Labs,

15
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:42,253
just down the street from this convention center.

16
00:00:43,154 --> 00:00:46,055
And now I'm at CSUN Incorporated on an epic fantasy MOBA

17
00:00:46,275 --> 00:00:47,616
called Relics of Gods.

18
00:00:48,977 --> 00:00:52,539
Now, this list of credits doesn't have much in common.

19
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:54,580
That's kind of the point.

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,742
I've had to jump from techno thriller to space fantasy

21
00:00:58,162 --> 00:01:00,263
to a game about the afterlife, like Hell,

22
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:04,265
and then to comedy aimed at kids, like The Dreadnought Kids.

23
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:08,251
And whenever I had to make those transitions, I wound up doing research.

24
00:01:10,072 --> 00:01:12,513
So, why do I think you might need research skills?

25
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:18,055
I noticed a particular need for them during my transition from Star Wars The Old Republic to Mass Effect 2.

26
00:01:19,255 --> 00:01:20,656
Well, that's the polite way of saying it.

27
00:01:21,016 --> 00:01:23,997
The real story is, on Star Wars, our lead writer kept telling me,

28
00:01:24,457 --> 00:01:27,018
Chris, stop trying to put science in Star Wars.

29
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,677
Star Wars isn't actually science fiction.

30
00:01:29,977 --> 00:01:31,417
Lightsabers don't work.

31
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,538
Planets made of swamps don't work.

32
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:35,678
Act like the humanities major you are.

33
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,120
The extent of science in Star Wars is, direct quote,

34
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,341
blasters and turbo lasers and BOOM!

35
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:47,662
A year later, I get a call from our design department director who says,

36
00:01:47,682 --> 00:01:49,923
Hi Chris, you're going to be working on Mass Effect 2

37
00:01:50,003 --> 00:01:51,663
because three of our six writers just left

38
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:52,823
and the fourth one broke his shoulder.

39
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:56,705
So we need you to write the galaxy map and the codex entries.

40
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:01,228
And I said, sure, I like space stories, fine, bring me up to speed, how do I make a planet?

41
00:02:01,648 --> 00:02:03,209
And so they handed me this.

42
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,533
This is a table of the minimum molecular weights of gases retained by a heavenly body.

43
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:14,836
You just figure out the density of the planet compared to Earth and then the diameter in

44
00:02:14,856 --> 00:02:19,759
kilometers, and you cross-reference the molecular weights of gases like hydrogen or argon, which

45
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:20,660
are on another page.

46
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,322
Or you could refer to your handy chemistry textbook.

47
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:25,470
And if you want the planet to support life,

48
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,570
you need to have a proper mix of nitrogen and oxygen.

49
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,231
And good god, Chris, get to the point already.

50
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:35,093
So I asked, does your audience really care about this stuff?

51
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,134
And the answer was, probably a handful of them do.

52
00:02:38,434 --> 00:02:39,595
But more to the point, this is part

53
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:41,976
of what made Mass Effect 1 hard science fiction.

54
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:44,317
And if you take that away from players in Mass Effect 2,

55
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:45,357
they're going to complain.

56
00:02:46,097 --> 00:02:48,658
So Chris, can you write hard SF, even though you've never

57
00:02:48,698 --> 00:02:49,198
done it before?

58
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:54,087
And I suspect questions like that will come up for some of the writers in this room.

59
00:02:54,968 --> 00:02:59,031
Because not every writer finds a niche in one genre and stays with it throughout their whole lives.

60
00:02:59,511 --> 00:03:02,433
Often, writers get hired because their dialogue samples were good,

61
00:03:02,793 --> 00:03:05,194
and their list of credits are good, or because they're good in a room.

62
00:03:05,655 --> 00:03:07,196
And the writer has to learn on the job.

63
00:03:07,556 --> 00:03:08,517
That means research.

64
00:03:08,957 --> 00:03:09,917
And that's what this talk's about.

65
00:03:09,937 --> 00:03:15,161
So let's break this subject down by first examining types of research.

66
00:03:15,681 --> 00:03:19,343
The first type I could think of is if you haven't just heard of your subject, you've lived it.

67
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:25,698
Say you're writing space opera and you've got a degree in astrophysics, like Catherine Asaro.

68
00:03:26,378 --> 00:03:30,221
For those who are unaware, Dr. Asaro is a science fiction novelist who once wrote a book

69
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:34,543
that used as its plot structure an equation for the behavior of quantum particles.

70
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:38,325
Like the particles, the characters get attracted up to a certain point,

71
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:41,447
then they repel each other, and then they stay apart, but they still influence each other.

72
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:45,409
The entire concept for the novel came out of her first-hand knowledge of subatomic physics.

73
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:47,730
You may not have that skill set.

74
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,461
But you might have something else in your biography.

75
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:53,163
Have you traveled to Hong Kong so you

76
00:03:53,183 --> 00:03:54,364
can write it into your crime game?

77
00:03:54,764 --> 00:03:56,525
Were you in the army and drove a tank,

78
00:03:56,545 --> 00:03:58,226
so your vehicle levels might be interesting?

79
00:03:58,246 --> 00:04:00,707
Are you a practicing druid and writing epic fantasy?

80
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:03,469
Or are you basically just a guy or a girl

81
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:04,289
with an English degree?

82
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:06,030
Because if you are, you might want

83
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,911
to consider expanding your first-hand knowledge somehow.

84
00:04:09,472 --> 00:04:10,753
So first-hand knowledge is great,

85
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:12,554
but like anything, it's got pros and cons.

86
00:04:12,974 --> 00:04:13,615
On the pro side.

87
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,551
you will know a wealth of detail about your subject,

88
00:04:16,731 --> 00:04:19,191
so you're more likely to create a more original story

89
00:04:19,251 --> 00:04:21,012
than a writer who's just going by the numbers.

90
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:23,532
Frequently, you'll be able to win arguments

91
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:24,612
with the rest of the dev team,

92
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:26,233
because you know what you're talking about.

93
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:30,994
And you'll have the perspective to know

94
00:04:31,674 --> 00:04:33,994
when something isn't important to the player experience.

95
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:37,835
Your knowledge also won't depend on anyone else's schedule.

96
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:41,095
So if you're in production and you need a question answered,

97
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:41,836
it'll be right there.

98
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:43,456
Lastly, it goes with you.

99
00:04:44,937 --> 00:04:47,059
Any job you take, you have your knowledge base to draw from.

100
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,540
Disadvantages.

101
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:54,745
Well, you're highly unlikely to be a nuclear scientist slash Navy SEAL slash gang member

102
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:56,687
slash cowboy slash medieval knight.

103
00:04:57,787 --> 00:05:02,331
Second, just because you know more than the rest of the team doesn't mean you know everything.

104
00:05:02,671 --> 00:05:06,614
You could have expertise as a cop because you were one for 20 years, but if it was 10

105
00:05:06,654 --> 00:05:09,557
years ago, maybe you don't know much about criminals using smartphones today.

106
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:12,539
Third, some knowledge comes with a price.

107
00:05:13,157 --> 00:05:17,301
If you want to fly off to Ecuador for three weeks to research ruins for the next Tomb Raider, you're going to need money.

108
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:23,006
If you want a master's in astrophysics from Harvard, you're going to need a lot of money and also a few years.

109
00:05:24,148 --> 00:05:28,932
For this last reason, first-hand knowledge is the sort of thing you get well before your game is in production.

110
00:05:29,653 --> 00:05:31,555
During production, your butt stays in that chair.

111
00:05:33,817 --> 00:05:37,100
So the next obvious step is to dig up every friend of a friend you can to find an expert.

112
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:40,252
I tried to come up with a list that would help most genres of game writers, but the

113
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:42,553
list is just too long, so I'm going to recommend two sites.

114
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:45,893
One is the aptly named Expertise Finder.

115
00:05:47,554 --> 00:05:50,875
It's free, and it's dedicated to hooking up writers with university professors of many

116
00:05:50,895 --> 00:05:51,595
different subjects.

117
00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:55,436
Not only can you ask for their opinions, you can ask for their contacts.

118
00:05:55,676 --> 00:05:59,436
It's great to talk to a criminologist, but don't forget, the criminologist might be able

119
00:05:59,456 --> 00:06:01,617
to introduce you to actual criminals behind bars.

120
00:06:03,017 --> 00:06:05,238
Next up is a site called Journalist's Toolbox.

121
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,002
And as much as we all boo journalists when they get something wrong about video games,

122
00:06:09,522 --> 00:06:12,244
you have to realize journalists are extroverted writers.

123
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:16,266
They are called upon to digest large amounts of information from experts

124
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:21,249
and repeat it back in as little as a day, every day.

125
00:06:21,989 --> 00:06:23,270
So their links can be your links.

126
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,672
Lastly, there are mailing lists and hobbyist forums.

127
00:06:26,852 --> 00:06:28,773
On Mass Effect 2 and 3, these saved my life.

128
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:32,131
One of the first things I did was create a new email account

129
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:34,213
and hook it up to a group called SFConSim,

130
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:37,255
or the Science Fiction Conflict Simulation Mailing List,

131
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:39,256
which is populated by hard SF creators.

132
00:06:39,757 --> 00:06:41,958
They were a great help and never dismissed any of my concerns.

133
00:06:43,739 --> 00:06:45,561
So the upsides of experts are fairly obvious.

134
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:48,763
First, most productions that try to take themselves seriously

135
00:06:49,183 --> 00:06:51,105
try to have some form of technical consultant.

136
00:06:51,764 --> 00:06:54,626
Now, there are some awesome productions out there that don't take themselves seriously,

137
00:06:55,046 --> 00:07:00,410
but if you're writing games about cops or war or spies or a historical period piece,

138
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,012
you should check in with an expert. This also goes for writing characters that are out of

139
00:07:04,032 --> 00:07:07,574
your comfort zone. Maybe you're writing a character that has a different ethnicity,

140
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:10,316
is from another part of the world, or has a different sexual preference.

141
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:14,920
You probably want to run your ideas by someone before you end up writing The Phantom Menace.

142
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:24,678
Experts are also usually free, at least until you

143
00:07:24,718 --> 00:07:27,180
are at a large company and are trying to have somebody

144
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,181
on staff all the time.

145
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:33,525
Usually, you can get all you need from a free deal.

146
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:36,168
Because if you say, hey, I'm writing a video game.

147
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,290
Please tell me about your job, and I'll try to work it in.

148
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,211
Most people are happy to talk for hours.

149
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:42,573
You give them a special thanks credit, and everyone wins.

150
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,111
Third, like with first-hand knowledge,

151
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:46,692
experts can give you perspective.

152
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:48,673
What looks good on paper and in movies

153
00:07:48,913 --> 00:07:50,354
could totally not work in the real world

154
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:51,694
for very elementary reasons.

155
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:55,176
If you remember the molecular weights of gases retained table,

156
00:07:55,937 --> 00:07:57,458
in plain English, told by an expert,

157
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,799
that table answers a really basic question

158
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:00,579
about space travel.

159
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:02,380
It's why you can't terraform the moon.

160
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:05,002
If the heavenly body you're talking about is small enough,

161
00:08:05,142 --> 00:08:06,663
it doesn't matter how much air you pump in,

162
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:07,923
doesn't matter how many trees you plant.

163
00:08:08,184 --> 00:08:10,085
It's gravity is so weak, all the air you add

164
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,245
is going to float away into space.

165
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:15,862
Downsides, your expert may not be good about checking their email,

166
00:08:15,982 --> 00:08:17,823
and they could also be in a vastly different time zone.

167
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:21,366
Sometimes questions pop up, you can't get an answer, you've got to make a judgment call.

168
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,928
Second, experts aren't foolproof, and they can disagree.

169
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:28,631
On Mass Effect, I referred to a physics teacher of mine, who now works for NASA,

170
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:31,713
and I asked him questions about technology based on string theory.

171
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:33,174
And his answer was,

172
00:08:33,935 --> 00:08:35,136
String theory is bunk.

173
00:08:36,577 --> 00:08:40,240
So, either he's wrong, or the whole sub-discipline of string theorists are wrong.

174
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,687
And I'm really not qualified to tell you which.

175
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:46,189
So we didn't rely on string theory for any of the tech

176
00:08:46,229 --> 00:08:46,829
in Mass Effect.

177
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:49,090
It also goes without saying you need to formulate

178
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,970
your questions right in order to get accurate results

179
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:51,611
from your expert.

180
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:54,712
Lastly, sometimes an expert will have conflicting interests

181
00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:55,052
with you.

182
00:08:55,812 --> 00:08:56,893
This happened to me most prominently

183
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:59,373
on the TV show The Agency, where our technical consultants

184
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,574
were former CIA agents.

185
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:04,395
If they gave away sources or methods and we put it on TV,

186
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,716
that means all the spies in the field couldn't

187
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,797
use those techniques anymore.

188
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,902
So when we questioned these people who were professionally trained at giving misinformation,

189
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:19,025
sometimes we hit a wall and our fictional spies had to use public domain methods dating back to

190
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:25,268
World War II. Then there's searching for reliable information online, also known as drinking from

191
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:30,430
the fire hose. The reporter's maxim is to find two independent sources before declaring anything

192
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,172
as fact. That's usually plenty enough due diligence to get your argument a fair shot when you run it

193
00:09:34,212 --> 00:09:34,752
by other devs.

194
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:39,217
There are academic and scientific papers out there, but you frequently have to be a subscriber

195
00:09:39,237 --> 00:09:42,278
to look at the actual data in things like the Journal of the AMA.

196
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:45,360
It was like $125 or so every 12 months.

197
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:49,363
Even when trying to come up with alien biology for Mass Effect, I never needed the results

198
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:50,424
of a paper that badly.

199
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:51,985
You know, the summaries are usually sufficient.

200
00:09:53,007 --> 00:09:56,530
Television shows and reporters often make use of something called LexisNexis

201
00:09:56,871 --> 00:10:00,754
to research legal cases and news articles, but their subject matter is frequently

202
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:04,618
cops and lawyers and people who need to know what's going on in

203
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:08,702
illegal cases right now. It's much less frequent in video games,

204
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:12,105
unless you all want to make some video games about that, so go right ahead.

205
00:10:14,968 --> 00:10:16,029
Where video games rule

206
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:17,070
is fan wikis.

207
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:22,606
They can tell you scads of details about all kinds of media properties.

208
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:27,008
And then there's the last resort, which is flinging a question at Yahoo Answers and hoping

209
00:10:27,068 --> 00:10:30,930
some complete stranger is passing by with the knowledge you need in the time you need.

210
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:33,091
You can usually do better than that.

211
00:10:34,112 --> 00:10:36,513
So you're undoubtedly familiar with the power of electronic sources.

212
00:10:36,953 --> 00:10:39,695
There are websites and enthusiast groups for almost everything.

213
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:41,756
They're extremely fast and convenient.

214
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:44,998
You can access most sources with your phone while you're sitting in the audience at a

215
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:47,959
lecture hall listening to some narrative designer tell you things you already know.

216
00:10:49,026 --> 00:10:51,907
As for other advantages, what more do you need?

217
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:55,228
I googled it, I checked Wikipedia, boom, we're done, time for chocolate!

218
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:57,169
Right?

219
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,331
Now, there are many downsides to electronic sources.

220
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:06,152
Because crawling down the rabbit hole is fun, you can end up with a head full of TV tropes

221
00:11:06,172 --> 00:11:10,114
and info totally irrelevant to your game, and you can make crazy assumptions about your

222
00:11:10,214 --> 00:11:11,714
subject matter with no one to call you on it.

223
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:16,516
You also get in the habit of searching for answers instead of working around your shortcomings.

224
00:11:17,137 --> 00:11:19,218
Wikipedia in particular has a hidden trap.

225
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:21,240
It has enough editors working on it

226
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,661
that if you find a fact, put it in, and then three months

227
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:25,182
later you want to double check the fact,

228
00:11:25,543 --> 00:11:27,044
you may find the fact has disappeared.

229
00:11:27,544 --> 00:11:29,465
And then you have to guess whether it's from an edit

230
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:30,926
or if your memory is suspect.

231
00:11:31,347 --> 00:11:33,028
This inevitably happens late in production

232
00:11:33,188 --> 00:11:35,490
when you're wanting to double check stuff before lockdown,

233
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,451
and you don't want to spend time searching

234
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:39,272
for a revision that may never have existed.

235
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:40,753
So watch out.

236
00:11:41,717 --> 00:11:44,018
Lastly, I want to speak a little about Google Image Search.

237
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:46,800
Since at Faber Labs, it was invaluable for trying

238
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,320
to give references to our art department.

239
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:51,282
If you pick something out of the ordinary,

240
00:11:51,382 --> 00:11:53,523
like pretty far out of the ordinary as your subject

241
00:11:53,563 --> 00:11:56,104
matter, image search is not always going to be your friend.

242
00:11:57,144 --> 00:11:59,305
At Faber Labs, our afterlife game, Like Hell,

243
00:11:59,446 --> 00:12:01,386
had characters from all different times and places

244
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:02,867
in history showing up in the afterlife.

245
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:07,070
And I wanted a major NPC, Akaba, here, to be from West Africa,

246
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,151
specifically the Ashanti of Ghana.

247
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:13,653
And I said she lived around 1895 in the late colonial period.

248
00:12:14,273 --> 00:12:15,974
And then because we were a hidden object game,

249
00:12:16,414 --> 00:12:19,376
I had to come up with object images for 150 hidden objects

250
00:12:19,716 --> 00:12:22,637
from Akaba's house in rural Ghana in 1895.

251
00:12:23,378 --> 00:12:25,159
And what you get in Google Image Search,

252
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:26,499
if you're looking for a house in Ghana,

253
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,401
is photos of the colonial period in black and white,

254
00:12:30,481 --> 00:12:32,122
so our artists didn't know what colors to use.

255
00:12:33,144 --> 00:12:35,806
wrong time period stuff, modern westernized Ghana,

256
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:38,267
hi guys, and Guinean cuisine.

257
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,469
And unsurprisingly if you look at the settings of our competition in hidden

258
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:45,751
object games, you get two settings. You get 20th century America

259
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:49,112
and Victorian London where there are mountains more image references.

260
00:12:49,773 --> 00:12:53,975
I filled out my 150 objects but let's just say there's more pangolin soups in

261
00:12:53,995 --> 00:12:55,736
those scenes than anybody expected.

262
00:12:58,417 --> 00:12:59,578
Then there's books and magazines.

263
00:13:00,451 --> 00:13:07,554
Nonfiction books can be the product of decades of labor and conveniently sum up hundreds of scientific studies in an accessible format.

264
00:13:08,075 --> 00:13:11,296
Print can also introduce you to subcultures that you didn't know existed.

265
00:13:11,856 --> 00:13:15,178
If you want to find people who know what to do when your plane goes down over Siberia

266
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,439
and you have to make a bow and arrow from scratch so you can hunt on the tundra,

267
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,160
Expertise Finder won't help.

268
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,142
But I found Primitive Archer magazine.

269
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:26,044
You can find it at newsstands.

270
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:28,025
Not in libraries, newsstands.

271
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:30,866
So it led me to the subculture of flintknappers,

272
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:32,707
the hobbyists who make knives and arrowheads

273
00:13:32,747 --> 00:13:33,908
like they did in the Stone Age

274
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,969
by banging moose antlers against rocks.

275
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:38,270
Far Cry Primal, anyone?

276
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,671
And then there's stealing from printed fiction.

277
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:43,772
Lots of game devs will talk about

278
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:45,773
what they saw on TV last night or at the movies,

279
00:13:46,114 --> 00:13:47,674
but everyone's stealing from that already.

280
00:13:48,215 --> 00:13:49,715
This is not just about being derivative,

281
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,056
it's about providing variety.

282
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,443
When I was coming up with the Thanix Cannon Codex for Mass Effect 2,

283
00:13:54,904 --> 00:13:57,546
I had to pick out a new weapon that improved on your ship's main gun.

284
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,448
It had to have physics that worked, but it couldn't be a laser.

285
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:01,509
Lasers are boring.

286
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:03,711
It couldn't be a railgun or coilgun.

287
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:04,971
That's what it was replacing.

288
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:06,673
Couldn't be a particle beam weapon.

289
00:14:06,793 --> 00:14:07,634
We had one of those.

290
00:14:08,054 --> 00:14:11,477
Couldn't be a plasma weapon, because, fun fact, plasma weapons don't really work.

291
00:14:12,577 --> 00:14:15,340
And I didn't know a lot of hard science, but Arthur C. Clarke did,

292
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,601
and he came up with something called the stiletto beam.

293
00:14:18,394 --> 00:14:20,015
So I'm actually curious about this.

294
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:21,916
Has anyone ever heard of the stiletto beam?

295
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:24,817
Two people.

296
00:14:25,237 --> 00:14:25,477
Cool.

297
00:14:26,737 --> 00:14:28,058
It's similar to a rail gun, where

298
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:29,719
you use magnets to fire the projectile,

299
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,900
except the projectile is molten metal.

300
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,221
It's a self-forging fragment, and you really

301
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:36,161
don't want to get hit with it.

302
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,842
And it wasn't on TV last night.

303
00:14:37,942 --> 00:14:40,483
It was published in a novel called Earth Flight back

304
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:40,823
in 1951.

305
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:42,664
It's right there on the cover.

306
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:44,865
Some print material becomes dated.

307
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:46,565
Newtonian physics, not so much.

308
00:14:48,307 --> 00:14:52,610
So fiction and nonfiction can be great, but the bad news is they're slow at two points.

309
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:55,952
One is when you're searching for the ideas.

310
00:14:56,092 --> 00:14:59,914
The other is when you're actually doing the writing and need to double check the details before your deadline.

311
00:15:00,794 --> 00:15:02,755
Relying on your memory is not a good idea.

312
00:15:02,976 --> 00:15:06,397
Details get lost, so mark the pages with sticky notes labels.

313
00:15:07,398 --> 00:15:09,739
Another strike against print is that it looks authoritative,

314
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:12,501
but some books that are marketed as the real deal simply aren't.

315
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:18,353
There's, for example, the Hitman Manual, probably not written by a hitman.

316
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:20,434
Anarchist Cookbook?

317
00:15:20,614 --> 00:15:21,715
Don't try it at home.

318
00:15:23,337 --> 00:15:27,480
If you found a book in the science section, that's no guarantee that it's settled science.

319
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:29,682
And then there's just omission.

320
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,786
You can read a book like Codename Mule, a perfectly reasonable account of the CIA's

321
00:15:34,826 --> 00:15:37,928
secret war in Laos during the Vietnam conflict by a guy who was there.

322
00:15:38,849 --> 00:15:39,630
Analysts be generous.

323
00:15:40,144 --> 00:15:41,184
probably not a lie in the book.

324
00:15:41,364 --> 00:15:42,945
He just has to tell his own experiences.

325
00:15:43,385 --> 00:15:45,706
But if that's the only book you read on the war in Laos,

326
00:15:45,766 --> 00:15:47,226
you never hear all the other sources

327
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:49,147
accusing the CIA of running heroin

328
00:15:49,187 --> 00:15:50,347
to help finance the war effort.

329
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:53,248
That's like the juiciest detail ever,

330
00:15:53,388 --> 00:15:54,888
and he's basically saying the government party

331
00:15:54,908 --> 00:15:55,428
is lying about it.

332
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:56,869
I don't know the truth about it.

333
00:15:57,009 --> 00:15:59,629
I just know a single book should not

334
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:00,610
be your only source either.

335
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,781
So, now let's try to get into some specific techniques to try to save you all some time.

336
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:14,323
The first step is the big strategic one. I've encountered basically two ways writer teams

337
00:16:14,343 --> 00:16:19,506
approach research. Approach one is the writer's research all they can, and they write up a ton

338
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:23,407
of lore, then they build their plots, and they pitch and design game levels based on what works

339
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:29,110
in this universe. Approach two is you research only as needed. You spitball ideas for game levels,

340
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,852
once they sound entertaining, you do the research to work out the details. So both approaches work,

341
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:35,132
but the first one...

342
00:16:36,277 --> 00:16:41,559
Well, it requires the writers to have enough power to nix some level design ideas, which is not a given depending on what company you're at.

343
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,780
It also means you're shutting out other departments at the concept stage.

344
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:50,282
The second approach will probably make you more popular due to more team input.

345
00:16:50,662 --> 00:16:51,643
It's also faster.

346
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:53,223
Time is money.

347
00:16:53,923 --> 00:16:58,765
Importantly, lore is also usually easier to change than everything else downstream of the writer.

348
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:02,007
So lots of lore usually gets thrown out during production anyway.

349
00:17:02,947 --> 00:17:03,667
Or at least revised.

350
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:06,095
The downside is that your finished product

351
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:08,717
could look patched together unless you are out there

352
00:17:08,797 --> 00:17:10,518
evangelizing to your team constantly.

353
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,461
Okay, now for the elephant in the room,

354
00:17:14,561 --> 00:17:16,883
which is why are we so worried about getting it right?

355
00:17:17,644 --> 00:17:19,125
Sometimes it is actually more efficient

356
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:21,447
to write in a way that doesn't require research.

357
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:23,408
I'm gonna hit you with a wall of text here,

358
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:24,769
don't freak, it's just broken down

359
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:26,430
into two examples of the same scene.

360
00:17:28,312 --> 00:17:30,614
Let's say someone just got poisoned on our space opera.

361
00:17:30,894 --> 00:17:32,695
The dialogue on the left is fact-filled.

362
00:17:33,354 --> 00:17:35,116
It mentions the name of the poisonous fish he ate.

363
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:37,638
It draws a parallel to fugu, an earth fish.

364
00:17:38,238 --> 00:17:40,120
It says what part is toxic and why.

365
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,882
And it says two rules for the IP that the other writers

366
00:17:42,922 --> 00:17:44,223
on the team now have to remember.

367
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,726
By comparison, the rewritten example on the right

368
00:17:48,066 --> 00:17:49,328
just gets across the main point.

369
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:50,749
We have a poison crew member.

370
00:17:51,089 --> 00:17:52,870
Then it throws in some humor and some sass

371
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,752
and puts the pressure on the player to make a decision.

372
00:17:55,152 --> 00:17:57,054
And it only really gives them the essential information.

373
00:17:57,434 --> 00:17:58,936
Everything else is characterization.

374
00:18:00,457 --> 00:18:02,378
If you want to look at that for just a second.

375
00:18:05,073 --> 00:18:06,194
Okay, let's move on.

376
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:08,996
Okay, sometimes you don't want to fudge it.

377
00:18:09,196 --> 00:18:11,797
That is where I personally use a technique I call one slice.

378
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:14,859
Its point is to impart one single fact to the player.

379
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,901
You serve the player this one fact, like one slice of pizza,

380
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:20,003
and you create the illusion that there is more,

381
00:18:20,303 --> 00:18:21,584
in other words, the rest of the pizza.

382
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:23,205
Why just one fact?

383
00:18:23,445 --> 00:18:26,427
Because if you want to base any kind of plot structure on a fact,

384
00:18:26,747 --> 00:18:28,889
you want just one per scene.

385
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,951
So whoever your most knowledgeable character is about the subject,

386
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:33,425
They communicate this fact.

387
00:18:33,665 --> 00:18:34,626
They don't have to be a nerd.

388
00:18:34,926 --> 00:18:36,988
They just have to have a stronger handle on the subject

389
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:38,349
matter than whoever they're talking to.

390
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:41,411
Other characters can doubt them, but ultimately, it

391
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:42,071
proves to be true.

392
00:18:42,732 --> 00:18:43,953
Now, when you research that fact,

393
00:18:44,073 --> 00:18:45,634
you've given yourself a simpler task.

394
00:18:45,934 --> 00:18:47,496
You now have just one fact to confirm,

395
00:18:47,656 --> 00:18:49,297
rather than going on a fishing expedition.

396
00:18:49,777 --> 00:18:51,699
The end result is less time wasted on the internet

397
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:53,700
and fewer emails back and forth with your expert.

398
00:18:55,522 --> 00:18:56,983
So let's apply the one slice to a plot.

399
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:02,721
Say we're doing a modern world setting and we need a clue for your protagonist to find when they're on the trail of some robbers.

400
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:08,864
The robbers are tough, smart opponents, and at this point in the game you want a fact for your player to see they have military experience.

401
00:19:09,604 --> 00:19:12,486
So we can have plenty of filler or dead ends depending on gameplay needs,

402
00:19:12,826 --> 00:19:16,428
but the story advances when we hit one fact that our experts pick up on that screams,

403
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:17,328
military.

404
00:19:18,148 --> 00:19:22,190
So let's say the robbers took out a guard silently with a knife, because that takes training.

405
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:26,933
So we ask our technical consultants for our one fact, and we find out this could actually be a good one.

406
00:19:27,423 --> 00:19:29,844
because the way Hollywood shows it in every movie

407
00:19:30,224 --> 00:19:32,285
is different from the way Army manuals tell you to do it.

408
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:34,866
The Hollywood way, and I'm gonna get morbid here,

409
00:19:35,586 --> 00:19:37,487
it's so common we even have a hand gesture for it.

410
00:19:37,947 --> 00:19:40,248
But in Army manuals, it looks more like this.

411
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:43,029
You sort of stab in and then you push forward.

412
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:46,631
So we have one key clue that our expert character,

413
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,412
maybe a forensics guy, the medical examiner,

414
00:19:49,432 --> 00:19:50,712
something like that, or maybe somebody

415
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:51,513
who was in the military,

416
00:19:52,453 --> 00:19:53,874
their expert character can recognize it,

417
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:56,475
which gives the expert the illusion of competence.

418
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:00,489
Often, that's all you're really going for.

419
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:02,510
The primary goal is not to show

420
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,511
that you've done your research.

421
00:20:03,691 --> 00:20:05,993
The primary goal in commercial video games anyway

422
00:20:06,453 --> 00:20:08,854
is to entertain the audience, not educate them.

423
00:20:09,355 --> 00:20:10,996
Our core fact is not there for show.

424
00:20:11,296 --> 00:20:12,997
It gives us a step forward in the plot

425
00:20:13,318 --> 00:20:15,219
because now that the protagonists have this clue,

426
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:16,680
they're closer to the antagonist.

427
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,521
Mission complete, next scene.

428
00:20:20,022 --> 00:20:22,184
So now we should get specific about some major pitfalls

429
00:20:22,524 --> 00:20:26,427
in video game development, starting with, not this one.

430
00:20:27,739 --> 00:20:32,681
This one, chaos, because video game writers are inevitably dealing with a team environment.

431
00:20:33,021 --> 00:20:36,783
The rest of your team will be making content at the same time you are, downstream from

432
00:20:36,823 --> 00:20:36,983
you.

433
00:20:37,544 --> 00:20:41,426
So your facts and your lore rules better be learnable, and you better be teaching them.

434
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:46,468
But wait, you say, if I codify lore rules before the art and gameplay are created, they

435
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:47,209
might get thrown out.

436
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:52,011
But if I create them after the art and gameplay are created, like in codex entries or in-game

437
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:56,713
books that get written after VO lockdown, I can't teach them to anyone until it's too

438
00:20:56,753 --> 00:20:56,933
late.

439
00:20:58,135 --> 00:20:58,315
Yeah.

440
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:01,177
This is why writers need to evangelize the IP

441
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:02,798
to the rest of the team on a regular basis.

442
00:21:03,238 --> 00:21:04,778
Every week you go without evangelizing

443
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:06,539
is a week of work that might have to get thrown out.

444
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,081
I find email blasts saying IP rules created

445
00:21:10,221 --> 00:21:11,782
and a list of bullet points work okay.

446
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:13,863
Anything longer, nobody reads it.

447
00:21:14,823 --> 00:21:16,224
This helps enforce your rules,

448
00:21:16,324 --> 00:21:18,104
and if there's new hires halfway through the project,

449
00:21:18,365 --> 00:21:20,886
you can open up your sent file and have a folder

450
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:22,627
and send all the emails to them,

451
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:23,767
bring them up to speed quickly.

452
00:21:24,968 --> 00:21:26,748
Otherwise, well, chaos.

453
00:21:28,756 --> 00:21:30,277
Contradicting the team brings up a question.

454
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:32,979
How many rules of the universe do you really want to have?

455
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:37,602
Everybody starts out saying our lore will be consistent, but over time I see two schools

456
00:21:37,662 --> 00:21:41,665
of thought on the approach to lore rules. The first is what I call an exclusive universe.

457
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:45,007
Exclusive universes try to build their lore with a lot of specific

458
00:21:45,487 --> 00:21:48,389
research rules saying we have no X because Y.

459
00:21:49,547 --> 00:21:54,832
For example, according to some research codex entries, no one fires missiles at ships in the Mass Effect universe

460
00:21:55,553 --> 00:21:59,357
because the dominant ship technology in the future includes a system of anti-missile lasers.

461
00:21:59,837 --> 00:22:02,560
So instead, everybody uses weapons that are incredibly high-velocity guns.

462
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,102
So, let me find my next image here.

463
00:22:05,122 --> 00:22:10,427
Ah yeah, here's some people firing missiles at a Reaper ship in the Mass Effect universe.

464
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:12,429
Totally my fault, long story.

465
00:22:13,842 --> 00:22:16,523
The point is, in almost all future military IPs,

466
00:22:16,963 --> 00:22:17,844
missiles are common.

467
00:22:18,324 --> 00:22:19,985
Rules of no missiles are not common.

468
00:22:20,585 --> 00:22:22,926
Having rules based in research that aren't intuitive

469
00:22:23,146 --> 00:22:24,786
can bite you in your exclusive universe.

470
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:28,128
By contrast, there's the inclusive universe,

471
00:22:28,228 --> 00:22:30,008
the universe where the guiding principle is,

472
00:22:30,528 --> 00:22:31,829
yeah, we have that too.

473
00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:35,730
They have thunder gods next to dudes with spider DNA

474
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:38,952
who were clones from an alternate universe, and so on.

475
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:40,832
They just want to tell attention-grabbing stories,

476
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:41,893
and they do pretty well with them.

477
00:22:42,579 --> 00:22:46,301
The problem is, every now and then, the franchise gets so bizarre, it's hard on newcomers' brains,

478
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:48,041
and you have to reboot it with a simpler approach.

479
00:22:50,242 --> 00:22:52,683
Then there's the pitfall of becoming the unrelatable expert.

480
00:22:53,203 --> 00:22:55,744
Because you immersed yourself in a world to learn all about it,

481
00:22:55,924 --> 00:22:58,545
and because you see that there's at least a handful of people that know about it,

482
00:22:58,866 --> 00:23:00,526
you assume the fact is common knowledge.

483
00:23:01,086 --> 00:23:07,429
And it is, for some people, but almost certainly not a large portion of your demographic.

484
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:13,003
This is compounded if the person who is your usual safety valve is as big a nerd about a subject as you are.

485
00:23:13,463 --> 00:23:18,667
And in our industry, there might be some nerds there, so high likelihood of that.

486
00:23:18,827 --> 00:23:21,129
I refer to this as a two enthusiasts effect.

487
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:23,250
How do you get around this?

488
00:23:23,671 --> 00:23:27,233
Well, you remember the point of research is in case a player has done their homework,

489
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,755
but you can't expect them to do their homework.

490
00:23:30,796 --> 00:23:33,578
And sometimes the bar for being an unrelatable expert is very low.

491
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:39,361
For example, this hidden object scene is from Wuga's very fun game, Agent Alice.

492
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:43,523
Like every hidden object game I've ever played, the hidden objects are kind of loopy.

493
00:23:44,443 --> 00:23:45,364
You're in a casino vault.

494
00:23:46,164 --> 00:23:47,265
Why is there a chameleon here?

495
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:54,428
And a Siamese cat, and a gun, and a golden spade symbol on the door, and I think that's

496
00:23:54,448 --> 00:23:55,448
King Tut in the background.

497
00:23:56,929 --> 00:23:59,990
So at Fable Labs, I was determined, we're going to make our game differently.

498
00:24:00,612 --> 00:24:02,933
So I was paired with an artist who loved a lot of my ideas.

499
00:24:03,113 --> 00:24:05,294
We said our hidden objects would be based on a theme.

500
00:24:05,635 --> 00:24:07,696
There would be narrative told through the objects.

501
00:24:08,076 --> 00:24:10,017
If they didn't make sense, we wouldn't have them.

502
00:24:10,497 --> 00:24:12,898
And so I picked out hidden objects

503
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,119
for this chamber of science, in which the player goes

504
00:24:15,139 --> 00:24:17,480
through the possession of a lost soul who is a chemistry

505
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,220
professor in life.

506
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:20,461
And one of the hidden objects is a Florence flask.

507
00:24:21,162 --> 00:24:23,063
Please raise your hand if you've heard of a Florence flask.

508
00:24:25,064 --> 00:24:26,364
Not a ton of people.

509
00:24:28,364 --> 00:24:33,206
Please raise your hand or keep your hand up if you remember what a Florence flask looks like off the top of your head.

510
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:40,829
Okay, and if you can you spot the Florence flask in the table full of glassware? Okay, there's our problem.

511
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:48,492
Playtesters had no idea what the search image in their head should look like. A Florence flask looks like this, by the way.

512
00:24:49,682 --> 00:24:54,263
In Agent Alice, when you find objects in a scene, it's like, go, get your iPad.

513
00:24:54,683 --> 00:24:56,963
Boom, boom, boom, boom, find that one, find that one.

514
00:24:56,983 --> 00:24:58,004
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

515
00:24:58,504 --> 00:25:00,584
Cool. And then you replay it for more points.

516
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:01,844
And it's like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

517
00:25:01,864 --> 00:25:02,585
I know where everything is.

518
00:25:02,645 --> 00:25:03,365
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

519
00:25:04,485 --> 00:25:07,546
Because you can easily ID a chameleon, a cat, or a gun.

520
00:25:07,946 --> 00:25:11,427
In our gameplay, it was more like, hmm.

521
00:25:12,707 --> 00:25:14,647
Blink. Blink.

522
00:25:15,768 --> 00:25:16,908
Maybe I should Google that one.

523
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,240
Which is what I did when creating it.

524
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,981
I did one Google image search and became

525
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,021
an unrelatable expert.

526
00:25:23,501 --> 00:25:24,882
And the artist I gave the reference to,

527
00:25:25,202 --> 00:25:28,183
his first exposure to the idea was a captioned art reference.

528
00:25:28,323 --> 00:25:29,863
He already had his homework done for him,

529
00:25:30,223 --> 00:25:32,104
so he couldn't be a stopgap.

530
00:25:32,984 --> 00:25:34,705
As a matter of fact, congratulations.

531
00:25:34,745 --> 00:25:36,845
I think I just made you all into unrelatable experts

532
00:25:36,925 --> 00:25:38,086
as far as this scene is concerned.

533
00:25:40,726 --> 00:25:43,647
So last research pitfall, being imprisoned by the real world.

534
00:25:44,222 --> 00:25:46,163
I talked earlier about getting in the habit of searching

535
00:25:46,203 --> 00:25:48,164
for answers instead of getting in the habit of creating them.

536
00:25:48,765 --> 00:25:50,666
Knowing how things work in the real world

537
00:25:51,227 --> 00:25:53,468
can start you down the road to being no fun at all.

538
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:58,572
For if you resemble, excuse me, if you remember that example

539
00:25:58,612 --> 00:26:00,553
I had a little while ago about the right way to take out

540
00:26:00,574 --> 00:26:03,235
a sentry with a knife, yeah, the real professionals

541
00:26:03,275 --> 00:26:04,396
don't advocate that anymore.

542
00:26:05,057 --> 00:26:08,359
Melee weapons are pretty much obsolete in modern warfare,

543
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:10,080
and that's unlikely to change in the future.

544
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:13,023
This chart here from icasualties.org.

545
00:26:14,177 --> 00:26:20,241
is for Afghanistan, where over about 14 years, knives and bare hands together came to 0.13%

546
00:26:20,901 --> 00:26:26,444
of U.S. combat deaths. Most of the time, modern armies don't need to take out a sentry quietly.

547
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:31,627
They go in with overwhelming force, artillery, sniper cover, and special operations guys

548
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:36,929
who have higher likelihoods of sentry scenarios, they commission this silenced pistol, specifically

549
00:26:36,949 --> 00:26:40,911
for killing sentries, because they want maximum results with minimum risk.

550
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:44,044
But in video games, risk is fun.

551
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:45,785
Melee weapons are fun.

552
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:48,506
Sure, I want a pistol like this in my future video game,

553
00:26:48,586 --> 00:26:52,008
but I also want this and this.

554
00:26:52,788 --> 00:26:54,889
And more to the point, the combat designers on my team

555
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:55,349
want them.

556
00:26:55,509 --> 00:26:58,111
And if you say, nope, we don't do that, the lore says so,

557
00:26:58,151 --> 00:27:00,352
and I'm sticking to it, when you get voted down,

558
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:01,792
they're probably going to do it anyway.

559
00:27:02,332 --> 00:27:04,694
And then you, writer and lore expert, better retcon it,

560
00:27:04,754 --> 00:27:06,154
or else you have inconsistent lore.

561
00:27:07,815 --> 00:27:08,295
On that note.

562
00:27:09,606 --> 00:27:13,769
I wanted to say that despite all your efforts, you will probably at some point get it wrong.

563
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,131
Facts become dated.

564
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:17,292
It's sort of the nature of many facts.

565
00:27:17,873 --> 00:27:22,536
Your name will be on something that has gone out wide, and the error will seem glaring

566
00:27:22,577 --> 00:27:23,998
to a certain subsection of your audience.

567
00:27:24,758 --> 00:27:26,280
To some degree, this is normal.

568
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,141
Name any franchise you want.

569
00:27:28,581 --> 00:27:31,624
The more products it puts out, the more chances it has to vary in quality.

570
00:27:32,204 --> 00:27:35,767
And when it happens to you, you will have the urge to get out your side of the story.

571
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:37,949
This gives you three commonly used options.

572
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:41,162
The first option is to try to stay above the spray.

573
00:27:42,163 --> 00:27:45,144
This is a good instinct because fans take screenshots of dev posts,

574
00:27:46,104 --> 00:27:48,765
and anything thrown out onto the Internet can be considered there forever,

575
00:27:48,945 --> 00:27:51,106
including any attempt you make to retract your statement.

576
00:27:51,846 --> 00:27:54,627
Whatever the fan heat is, it can wait a day while you talk with your co-workers

577
00:27:54,687 --> 00:27:56,308
and figure out how to present to United Front.

578
00:27:56,748 --> 00:27:59,689
It also means you can make a note to address the concern in your next product,

579
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:02,090
at which point you can consider the problem in a sober manner.

580
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:07,312
The second option is to get out there on forums, fan wikis, interviews, convention appearances.

581
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:10,210
Depending on which corner of the internet you go to,

582
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,410
your experience may be positive, or it

583
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,831
could entail a ridiculous amount of personal risk,

584
00:28:14,951 --> 00:28:15,951
because these are fans.

585
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:19,752
And that enormous subject aside, it

586
00:28:19,772 --> 00:28:21,672
does have some actual benefits to you as a researcher.

587
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:23,513
Meeting fans will sometimes lead you

588
00:28:23,553 --> 00:28:25,753
to meeting new experts who have an interest in your material.

589
00:28:26,593 --> 00:28:28,514
Then there's the third option, which I've tried the most,

590
00:28:29,294 --> 00:28:31,054
which is to hide under the bed thinking

591
00:28:31,074 --> 00:28:32,235
you're a human garbage person.

592
00:28:34,235 --> 00:28:35,715
I don't recommend this strategy.

593
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,089
mostly because the clearance on most beds

594
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:39,910
is actually about 6 and 1⁄2 to 7 inches.

595
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:44,293
And the average chest thickness of adult humans is 9 and 1⁄2.

596
00:28:45,394 --> 00:28:46,955
So odds are you won't fit.

597
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:51,177
In conclusion, there's two recommendations

598
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:51,838
I can really give you.

599
00:28:52,118 --> 00:28:53,279
Either know your craft well enough

600
00:28:53,379 --> 00:28:55,560
that you can tell a good story, regardless of the fact,

601
00:28:56,461 --> 00:28:58,402
or get out there and do some research in ways

602
00:28:58,442 --> 00:28:59,563
that you can turn into material.

603
00:29:00,242 --> 00:29:02,623
There's hobbyists out there who can teach you how to pick locks.

604
00:29:02,964 --> 00:29:06,086
There are pilots who can show you how to land a plane when the engines catch fire.

605
00:29:06,526 --> 00:29:09,328
There are survivors of cults who can tell you how they were indoctrinated.

606
00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:13,472
There are nurses and patients who will let you know what it's like to be locked in a mental ward.

607
00:29:14,172 --> 00:29:16,794
Each of these could feed scenes that have been in video games before,

608
00:29:17,094 --> 00:29:20,777
but when you write them, they could have a different focus or a clearer ring of truth.

609
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:25,060
So tell the truth, not the facts, and when people play your scenes,

610
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,862
their experience might cause them to say,

611
00:29:26,882 --> 00:29:29,063
Huh, I got it right.

612
00:29:30,206 --> 00:29:31,436
Thank you for your time and attention.

613
00:29:32,162 --> 00:29:32,727
Time for chocolate.
