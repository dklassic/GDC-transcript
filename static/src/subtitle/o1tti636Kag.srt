1
00:00:06,748 --> 00:00:07,849
This is Tricks of the Trade.

2
00:00:08,129 --> 00:00:09,510
We have exactly six animators.

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,091
They have exactly five minutes to give you the best tips

4
00:00:12,131 --> 00:00:12,912
and tricks they know.

5
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:15,213
Please do not clap in between each one.

6
00:00:15,273 --> 00:00:16,774
Save all of the applause for the very end.

7
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:19,676
We are animators and we need every second you have.

8
00:00:20,376 --> 00:00:22,117
Take it away, Benson.

9
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:25,119
Okay.

10
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:28,779
Hi, I'm James Benson.

11
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:30,982
I worked in AAA for five minutes on Fable,

12
00:00:31,904 --> 00:00:33,266
and then the canceled boy simulator.

13
00:00:34,047 --> 00:00:35,389
Then I made Ori and the Blind Forest,

14
00:00:36,351 --> 00:00:39,756
and Firewatch, and now I'm making In the Valley of Gods.

15
00:00:43,457 --> 00:00:48,221
I'm going to talk specifically about some Unity system stuff, but the gist is all sort

16
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:48,981
of broadly applicable.

17
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:54,685
So tip number one, avoiding state machines and trying to keep your animation sets within

18
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:55,406
a single blend tree.

19
00:00:55,926 --> 00:01:00,389
So the problem with state machines basically is that they give you these kind of binary

20
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:02,831
possibility states where you're either standing or you're crouched.

21
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:05,233
And this isn't just a visual problem, it's a controls one.

22
00:01:06,694 --> 00:01:07,614
Why are blend trees better?

23
00:01:08,395 --> 00:01:10,756
So you can exist indefinitely in between two states.

24
00:01:11,456 --> 00:01:13,757
You can transition non-linearly by driving floats.

25
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,438
Mechanin by default, when you go in between states,

26
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:17,818
you can only do linear stuff.

27
00:01:17,998 --> 00:01:18,799
It's completely hard-coded.

28
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:19,519
There's no way around it.

29
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:23,300
Most importantly, they synchronize the footfalls

30
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:25,681
and they'll scale time so that everything

31
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:27,282
is seamlessly in sync.

32
00:01:28,242 --> 00:01:29,343
So that's sort of the basics.

33
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,545
Using these bits of knowledge,

34
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,506
you can replace almost all of your locomotion transitions

35
00:01:35,786 --> 00:01:37,347
with dynamically controlled blends.

36
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:39,348
So here, when we hit the ground,

37
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:41,870
we're blending into the crouch movement state

38
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,271
that we used for the previous little GIF.

39
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,853
And we can also define how far you're going to blend

40
00:01:47,953 --> 00:01:48,993
into that crouch movement

41
00:01:49,654 --> 00:01:51,635
by how fast you were going when you hit the ground.

42
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:54,256
So you can actually get a much more dynamic thing

43
00:01:54,296 --> 00:01:56,037
than you would have just by authoring a single clip.

44
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:59,626
Think of your blend tree like a flowchart asking a series of

45
00:02:00,526 --> 00:02:02,047
progressively more specific questions.

46
00:02:02,427 --> 00:02:04,348
So here, we're also asking how far away are

47
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:04,988
you from the ground?

48
00:02:05,348 --> 00:02:08,529
And because the answer is not very far, rather than throwing

49
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:10,450
you into a new state with a big falling loop and your

50
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,031
arms in the air, we just put you into a slow falling walk

51
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,572
where you have one foot out to catch you when you fall, and

52
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:17,632
then we do the little crouch bounce.

53
00:02:18,112 --> 00:02:20,653
And all in the same blend tree, it keeps you in the same

54
00:02:20,693 --> 00:02:22,313
foot phases, and it's a seamless thing.

55
00:02:23,982 --> 00:02:26,445
If the ground's further, you can go into more traditional falling loops,

56
00:02:26,505 --> 00:02:28,308
and if it's really far, you can do these kind of

57
00:02:28,688 --> 00:02:31,011
I'm going to die when I hit the ground animations.

58
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,355
And again, when you do hit the ground,

59
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:35,377
you know that the feet are going to perfectly be in phase

60
00:02:35,397 --> 00:02:36,539
and it's all going to be nice and seamless.

61
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:42,020
By putting your time into variations on your loops,

62
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,102
for different directions, accelerations, etc.

63
00:02:44,443 --> 00:02:46,986
You can skip a lot of individual clip authoring and management.

64
00:02:47,547 --> 00:02:51,472
And you'll also find that because you've made so many movement cycles,

65
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:57,019
you'll just naturally create much broader possibilities for movement for the character.

66
00:02:58,224 --> 00:03:01,728
So tip number two, build multiple layers of dynamics

67
00:03:01,808 --> 00:03:02,869
into your idle behaviors.

68
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,491
So keeping an NPC alive is really hard.

69
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:08,915
Baking a character's awareness of the environment

70
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:11,698
into the clips, it works very, very well

71
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:12,659
in a game like World of Warcraft.

72
00:03:13,119 --> 00:03:16,242
But if you need your NPC to be able to dynamically

73
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:19,485
direct their attention, like say into the player's eyes

74
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:21,247
in a first person game, you're gonna have to have

75
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:22,108
some kind of dynamics.

76
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:26,610
However, if you build your look at stuff as like a single IK chain,

77
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:28,175
it's going to be very rigid.

78
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:29,840
There's going to be no overshoot or overlap.

79
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:36,461
So if instead you split your character's attention into say the eyes, the head, the chest, the equipment they're using,

80
00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:41,003
even if you want all those things pointed in one direction, they're going to get there with different timings.

81
00:03:41,624 --> 00:03:45,866
And even better, you can point them in different places.

82
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:49,307
So for example, they have their torch on an interesting thing in the environment,

83
00:03:49,947 --> 00:03:53,309
and then they dynamically look back to you with their head and eyes to sort of signal,

84
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:54,870
look at this interesting thing I'm pointing at.

85
00:03:56,538 --> 00:04:00,559
Combined with locomotion, you can create interesting behaviors like dynamically looking over their

86
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:05,240
shoulder when they're walking backwards, or tracking the path that they're moving along

87
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,420
to give a sense that the character has some kind of forethought.

88
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:13,941
Those sort of systems work nicely with full-body IK, terrain kind of stuff, and you just generally

89
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:18,582
build up a sense that the character is animated within the space in the game and not like

90
00:04:18,902 --> 00:04:20,983
a series of clips in Maya or 3ds Max.

91
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:25,373
My next tip is facial capture.

92
00:04:26,094 --> 00:04:27,734
This is mostly a thing for small teams,

93
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:30,936
but my assumption until relatively recently

94
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:36,358
had been that face cap stuff was gated by enormous budgets

95
00:04:36,438 --> 00:04:37,159
and team sizes.

96
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,620
And it turns out that's just not really the case.

97
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,522
The software and hardware can be gone for a few thousand

98
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:47,163
dollars, and largely it's the same kind of stuff

99
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:48,084
that big teams are using.

100
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:49,744
It's more expensive just like.

101
00:04:50,565 --> 00:04:51,626
getting lots of people to crunch the data.

102
00:04:52,146 --> 00:04:56,229
But I think that it's not something that's super commonly

103
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:58,410
thought of in small teams as a feasible option.

104
00:05:00,392 --> 00:05:01,973
We've got two animators now at Camposanto,

105
00:05:01,993 --> 00:05:05,235
but even when it was just me and I was doing these initial tests,

106
00:05:05,395 --> 00:05:07,576
it still seemed like a very feasible thing in the pipeline

107
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:10,058
in terms of the time it takes and so on and so forth.

108
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,240
So those are all my tips and tricks.

109
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,460
If you didn't like any of them,

110
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:15,762
hopefully you'll like Jalil Sadul's tips.

111
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,533
No, we're good, we're good, we're good.

112
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:27,316
Hi, my name is Jadul Sadul, and I am the CEO and co-founder

113
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:28,537
of Stimulant Studios.

114
00:05:29,237 --> 00:05:32,138
It would be presumptuous of me to tell you how to build a

115
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:33,059
successful company.

116
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,120
I've only been doing this for three years, and I have a

117
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,721
feeling I need 10 more to really get the big picture.

118
00:05:38,482 --> 00:05:41,643
And it's even more ridiculous to be doing this in five minutes, but here we go.

119
00:05:42,343 --> 00:05:46,725
Most people ask how long since we've opened Stimulant Studios, and usually I say three

120
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:50,266
years, but in reality it's taken over 14 years, my whole career.

121
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:52,767
A good reputation is crucial.

122
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:57,429
Someday if you want to stand on your own in this industry, like running a studio, a strong

123
00:05:57,489 --> 00:06:00,910
network and a good rep will be extremely, extremely valuable.

124
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,551
It's a very small industry where everyone knows everyone.

125
00:06:04,872 --> 00:06:05,832
How do you keep a good rep?

126
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,638
You work hard. This is Lee, our Community Manager.

127
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:14,041
Focus on the achievable dream, not the blue sky dream.

128
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:17,143
Each step you take, make it your best step forward.

129
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,445
If you find yourself wanting status,

130
00:06:19,565 --> 00:06:21,006
then you are doing it wrong.

131
00:06:21,387 --> 00:06:23,288
The title of supervisor or director

132
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,290
will find you when you are ready.

133
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,852
You want to be remembered as a hard worker.

134
00:06:28,272 --> 00:06:30,334
If you're given a C-shot, don't complain.

135
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,036
Just do the best you can.

136
00:06:32,316 --> 00:06:34,778
You will get noticed if you put your heart and soul into it,

137
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:37,080
and it might be something that your colleagues never forget.

138
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,346
Keep in mind, the best animators out there can turn C shots into A shots.

139
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:44,909
Now, that's a skill that will get you noticed.

140
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,392
Be remembered as someone reliable.

141
00:06:48,473 --> 00:06:48,673
Nope.

142
00:06:49,694 --> 00:06:49,955
Wrong.

143
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:53,139
I got it.

144
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,000
There we go.

145
00:06:55,987 --> 00:06:58,867
Da da da, yeah, be even harder.

146
00:06:58,927 --> 00:07:00,348
It's difficult to get your first job,

147
00:07:00,368 --> 00:07:02,308
but it's even harder to keep a job.

148
00:07:02,528 --> 00:07:04,008
Make yourself invaluable to your team.

149
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:06,369
If you are new to the team, your chances are limited.

150
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:09,110
Yes, most supervisors play favorites.

151
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,850
Therefore, work towards getting yourself noticed.

152
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,131
We apply the same philosophy at St. Moyer Studios.

153
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:16,071
If we work hard for our clients,

154
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:17,572
they will always remember us

155
00:07:17,632 --> 00:07:19,512
and point others in our direction.

156
00:07:20,952 --> 00:07:23,633
Integrity is a huge part of building a strong team.

157
00:07:23,793 --> 00:07:24,753
Be honest.

158
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:27,986
With your clients, it's better for your brand

159
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:31,009
if you don't take a job, then take the job and do it badly.

160
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:33,991
Treat your team and clients like they are a big,

161
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:34,972
happy family.

162
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:37,515
There will be ups and downs, but in the end,

163
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:39,797
the product, as well as the process,

164
00:07:39,817 --> 00:07:41,018
will represent your brand.

165
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:43,741
Don't just partner with your best friends.

166
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:46,683
Partner with people who are as hardworking as you are.

167
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:48,705
Leaving your big ego at the door

168
00:07:48,945 --> 00:07:50,667
is the first thing you do in a partnership.

169
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:54,819
Know whether to trust your instincts or not trust it.

170
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,180
Use a good 10 years of your career as a guide.

171
00:07:57,661 --> 00:08:00,363
Study decisions you've made and where they've led you.

172
00:08:00,943 --> 00:08:03,345
But also do the same for your leadership team.

173
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:05,567
Sometimes you have to trust in your business partner's

174
00:08:05,607 --> 00:08:06,948
decision even if you disagree.

175
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:12,190
If a member of your leadership team makes the wrong call, fix it, learn from it, and

176
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,010
move forward.

177
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:15,491
Easier said than done, but it works.

178
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:18,672
Animators can be a bunch of drama queens.

179
00:08:18,872 --> 00:08:20,633
I know, I'm a bigger one myself.

180
00:08:21,213 --> 00:08:22,313
I speak their language.

181
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:27,175
Happily walking around the studio and bothering everyone means your shot is going really well.

182
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:31,821
Putting your headphones and hoodie on means your animation is not looking so good.

183
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,745
The trick is knowing how and when to help them.

184
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:36,808
Sometimes you just need to let them be.

185
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:40,292
Other times, jump in or that grumpiness will spread like the plague.

186
00:08:40,873 --> 00:08:42,536
My point is, know your team well.

187
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,592
Without respect, it all falls apart.

188
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,355
Too many companies promote based on seniority.

189
00:08:48,675 --> 00:08:49,696
It's a touchy subject.

190
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:53,259
You want to be respectful and promote your senior employees,

191
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,322
but how many of you have worked under supervisors

192
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:57,763
you just didn't believe in?

193
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,606
Promoting someone only because of seniority

194
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:03,369
will disrupt the team and put a needed pressure

195
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:04,029
on that person.

196
00:09:04,229 --> 00:09:07,172
Promote based on merit, and respect will follow.

197
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:10,952
Three years ago, we all took a big pay cut.

198
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:13,616
Luckily, being in Florida, we were able to survive.

199
00:09:14,076 --> 00:09:16,300
But when your studio finds stability,

200
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,085
make sure you re-evaluate everyone who made sacrifices

201
00:09:20,646 --> 00:09:23,410
at the very beginning, or you will lose the same people

202
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,232
who helped build your company.

203
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,792
Have a strong philosophy.

204
00:09:28,172 --> 00:09:31,135
At Stimulo Studios, we believe in never being scared to fail.

205
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:33,177
Arnold said it, I live by it.

206
00:09:33,837 --> 00:09:36,260
In the past, I only had my family to worry about.

207
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,782
Now we have 40 people and their families.

208
00:09:39,402 --> 00:09:41,324
As a small studio, we have to take risks,

209
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:43,326
but they have to be calculated risks.

210
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:46,848
Make sure your leadership team understands your company's philosophy.

211
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:48,928
If they do, everyone else will.

212
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:53,850
If I tell you that high quality of work and a family-oriented company is our philosophy,

213
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,011
you'll say that that's everyone else's motto.

214
00:09:56,051 --> 00:09:58,952
But before making any decision, we ask ourselves,

215
00:09:59,512 --> 00:10:02,133
can we produce the quality of work that represents us?

216
00:10:02,573 --> 00:10:04,434
And can we also do it?

217
00:10:05,074 --> 00:10:07,856
Can our team also do it within the deadline?

218
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:10,879
We don't take a job if it's going to hurt our team

219
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:12,320
with a lot of overtime.

220
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,301
Well, if you give me $10 million to risk

221
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:15,903
in Pong in a week, maybe I'd take it.

222
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:18,425
In the end, our team's well-being

223
00:10:18,465 --> 00:10:20,887
and the quality of work we produce is our brand.

224
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:21,887
Thank you very much.

225
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:23,929
And next, we have the lovely Al Mudena.

226
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:29,815
Okay, we're okay.

227
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,576
Hello, my name is Almudena Soria,

228
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:32,797
and I work at Naughty Dog.

229
00:10:33,657 --> 00:10:35,898
Today, I want to give some tips about motion capture,

230
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:38,299
starting with what to do before the shoot.

231
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,861
Often, motion capture sessions are done externally.

232
00:10:42,461 --> 00:10:44,442
We pay for space, actors, data,

233
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:46,883
so it is very important to plan ahead of time.

234
00:10:47,683 --> 00:10:50,064
Before shooting, you should have a very clear idea

235
00:10:50,204 --> 00:10:51,965
of what you want to capture and how.

236
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:55,146
This doesn't mean you can't experiment in the stage,

237
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:57,307
but the bigger decisions should happen in advance.

238
00:10:58,365 --> 00:11:02,531
It is important that you talk to designers, game and creative directors to discuss how

239
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:06,495
the performances would be, what speeds and height are required, and what is the tone

240
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:07,016
of the scenes.

241
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:11,602
Before you shoot, preview the scenes and implement them in the game.

242
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:14,285
These will answer a lot of questions before the capture.

243
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:17,349
The more accurate the previews, the better the capture would be.

244
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,040
Once you know what you want to capture, create a shot list.

245
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,802
Have different fields for all the information you need.

246
00:11:24,242 --> 00:11:26,903
Name, description on the move, characters, props.

247
00:11:27,364 --> 00:11:29,945
Try to keep all the information in one place.

248
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:32,207
Also, try to organize the shots

249
00:11:32,427 --> 00:11:34,168
so you don't have to jump between them.

250
00:11:35,348 --> 00:11:36,569
Use a good naming convention

251
00:11:36,789 --> 00:11:38,210
so you know what you are capturing

252
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,331
by just looking at the name.

253
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:42,784
Have in mind the actor's endurance.

254
00:11:43,264 --> 00:11:45,905
Don't have them doing a crouch move set for five hours

255
00:11:46,425 --> 00:11:48,026
or a sprint right after lunch.

256
00:11:48,686 --> 00:11:49,386
So mix it up.

257
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:51,767
Not only will it help the actor's well-being,

258
00:11:52,007 --> 00:11:53,007
but also their performance.

259
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:56,829
When shots require a build, try to sort this in order

260
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:58,610
so you don't have to take those builds down

261
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,630
if you're going to leave them later.

262
00:12:02,091 --> 00:12:04,352
My next tips are related to the day of the shoot.

263
00:12:05,512 --> 00:12:06,713
We work in empty spaces,

264
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:08,753
and that makes it difficult to communicate

265
00:12:08,834 --> 00:12:10,134
what we want to achieve to the actors.

266
00:12:10,638 --> 00:12:12,800
So take references with you to show them.

267
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,741
Things like footage on the game,

268
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:17,204
concept of the characters, environments,

269
00:12:17,364 --> 00:12:19,125
script of the scenes, and previous.

270
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:23,975
When giving directions, start by describing the context

271
00:12:24,195 --> 00:12:26,536
and what the situation is and let them act.

272
00:12:27,336 --> 00:12:29,436
While reading this book, directing actors

273
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:31,437
have learned that if it doesn't work

274
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:35,117
and it's absolutely necessary to give some more details,

275
00:12:35,397 --> 00:12:37,138
use verbs, not adjectives.

276
00:12:37,778 --> 00:12:41,198
For example, don't say something like, act more nervous.

277
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,239
Instead, you could say, move faster,

278
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:47,040
try to breathe heavily, fidget with your hands.

279
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:53,013
I want to emphasize though that it's better to let them act instead of giving such specific

280
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:53,554
directions.

281
00:12:54,695 --> 00:12:56,636
Also, listen to what the actors have to say.

282
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:59,919
All the time they come up with ideas that are very, very valuable.

283
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:06,125
Have someone that is not directing the shoot taking notes, so when the data is delivered

284
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:09,848
you don't have to look through all of it to know what you like in the first place.

285
00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:13,966
When capturing gameplay, there are specific requirements.

286
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:15,966
These are speed, movement trajectories,

287
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,087
beginning and end poses.

288
00:13:17,687 --> 00:13:20,048
These restrictions can make the performances stiff

289
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:22,528
and very unnatural, but they are necessary.

290
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:25,890
I like to start by not giving much direction at first

291
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,370
and start restricting from there.

292
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,271
Getting an accurate data on the stage

293
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,472
will save a lot of animator time.

294
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,953
You will need to find the right balance

295
00:13:35,053 --> 00:13:36,653
between the time spent at the stage

296
00:13:36,793 --> 00:13:39,114
and time spent adjusting the animations.

297
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:42,334
Here are a few tricks we use for gameplay captures.

298
00:13:42,934 --> 00:13:45,557
Guide on the ground to keep the actors on a straight line,

299
00:13:46,017 --> 00:13:48,059
cones to measure the speed, and guides

300
00:13:48,099 --> 00:13:50,480
to make sure the actors end up with the correct foot

301
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:50,921
position.

302
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:54,624
When capturing movements or scenes in parts,

303
00:13:55,144 --> 00:13:56,986
make sure you choose a good branching point.

304
00:13:57,686 --> 00:13:59,828
Match the poses and momentum, and make

305
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:02,010
sure you have enough data so you can

306
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,651
do a good blend between them.

307
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:08,175
And finally, some tips to manipulate motion capture data.

308
00:14:09,688 --> 00:14:16,013
When assembling takes together, make sure you spend time on assembling face before committing to polish.

309
00:14:16,694 --> 00:14:19,216
Avoid foot sliding big lerps or pops.

310
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:23,560
Ideally, if something wasn't capturing properly, you would recapture it.

311
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:29,345
But if you can't, try to do your best while working in non-linear editing, such as tracks or time editor.

312
00:14:30,967 --> 00:14:33,468
When a designer asks you to make an animation faster,

313
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:37,050
doesn't mean make it faster, just mean make it shorter.

314
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,811
So instead of speeding up the animation as a whole,

315
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,972
you could try to make just some of those parts shorter.

316
00:14:44,193 --> 00:14:45,273
For this, I use a trick,

317
00:14:45,473 --> 00:14:47,374
which is blending the animation with itself

318
00:14:47,714 --> 00:14:48,915
in tracks or time editor.

319
00:14:49,745 --> 00:14:53,366
I look at the original data and analyze where it would be okay to collapse time.

320
00:14:53,946 --> 00:14:57,767
Places like struggles, long recoveries, settlings, anticipations.

321
00:14:58,527 --> 00:15:02,748
These methods allowed for a very fast iteration without losing data and it's a very, very

322
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:03,389
visual way.

323
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:09,150
And my last tips, while working on a scene, use video reference from the shoot and keep

324
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:11,851
the original data so you can always compare it to your edits.

325
00:15:12,431 --> 00:15:14,012
And next on, it's Johan.

326
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:20,578
All right, hi.

327
00:15:21,258 --> 00:15:22,419
OK, let me do this.

328
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:24,621
Hi, everyone.

329
00:15:25,401 --> 00:15:26,162
My name is Johan.

330
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:28,543
I'm currently a principal animator at Riot Games,

331
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:30,124
working on League of Legends.

332
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:34,687
I first got into animation by taking a 2D animation course.

333
00:15:34,747 --> 00:15:38,129
And many of the ways I approach authoring my 3D animations

334
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,111
and problem solving is still from a very 2D perspective.

335
00:15:41,952 --> 00:15:44,413
These next tips, or I should really say my habits,

336
00:15:44,533 --> 00:15:46,895
are things I noticed myself doing on a day-to-day basis.

337
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:58,322
So here we go. Trick number one. Draw on your monitor. I use a dry erase marker to dry over my animation as a way of tracking what I've done so far or to plan what I want to do next.

338
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:00,454
Here's what you need.

339
00:16:01,215 --> 00:16:04,436
Dry erase markers, whiteboard cleaner, cleaner refill,

340
00:16:04,616 --> 00:16:05,516
microfiber cloth.

341
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,637
And I just want to say I haven't run in any monitors so

342
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,458
far, but I work on Dell monitors.

343
00:16:10,518 --> 00:16:11,938
I don't know about Apple ones.

344
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:13,519
They use special coatings.

345
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:13,859
I don't know.

346
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:15,259
So use discretion.

347
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,960
Here are a few things you can do with the marker.

348
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:22,702
Well, we can create a line of action, ID to pose.

349
00:16:22,742 --> 00:16:24,862
And basically, you can rough in your pose and line up the

350
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,583
character to the drawing.

351
00:16:26,703 --> 00:16:27,003
It's fun.

352
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:33,843
Another thing we can do, keep track of contact points, like foot contact and hand placement.

353
00:16:33,863 --> 00:16:39,968
Basically, you mark the point and you slide your post back in place. It's a really great way of

354
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:45,453
tracking swings and arcs. By dotting the key frames and connecting the dots, you can

355
00:16:45,473 --> 00:16:48,876
visualize the path. This also lets us visualize timing.

356
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:52,036
By tracking the spacing between the poses,

357
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:53,857
we can see how fast or slow something is moving,

358
00:16:53,937 --> 00:16:55,858
which kind of leads me to my next tip,

359
00:16:55,918 --> 00:16:59,699
tip number two, use evenly spaced key frames.

360
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,060
And so what do I mean by that?

361
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,121
When doing this, I set keys along even intervals,

362
00:17:05,921 --> 00:17:07,221
like in this case, every three frames,

363
00:17:08,162 --> 00:17:09,462
and delete anything in between.

364
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,743
And I should emphasize this is usually for a small range,

365
00:17:12,143 --> 00:17:13,043
like a swing or an attack.

366
00:17:13,924 --> 00:17:14,784
And why is this useful?

367
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:17,166
Well, it lets you visualize your timing in your animation

368
00:17:17,186 --> 00:17:18,427
when jumping between your keyframes.

369
00:17:19,188 --> 00:17:20,889
I'm gonna try to explain using this movement.

370
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:22,991
Here you can see the object is accelerating

371
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:24,892
in the beginning and slowing down near the end.

372
00:17:26,093 --> 00:17:29,656
And I'm gonna show you the keyframes in that movement.

373
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,798
You can see how different the spacing is at the bottom.

374
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:34,080
And let's just say we were to key evenly

375
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,241
for the same movement like every four frames.

376
00:17:37,455 --> 00:17:39,776
And I want to compare these two and show you how we can

377
00:17:39,796 --> 00:17:41,496
actually see the timing visualized.

378
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:44,838
And looking at the spacing of the non-uniform poses, I have

379
00:17:44,878 --> 00:17:46,578
no idea what the speed is like, because there's no

380
00:17:46,639 --> 00:17:49,500
constant where the key frames exist in time.

381
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,001
Looking at the example on the right, we know each pose is

382
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:53,721
four frames apart.

383
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:56,503
And then when looking at the poses now.

384
00:17:57,481 --> 00:18:02,105
We can clearly see that the ball is moving slowly in the beginning, zips across in the middle,

385
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:08,530
slows down near the end. I hope that made sense.

386
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:15,015
My last tip, orthographic views. Use orthographic views. I'm not sure, I'm sure you guys

387
00:18:15,556 --> 00:18:19,239
already do this, but I just want to emphasize how important it is, especially when you're

388
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:20,740
working on 3D games where your animation...

389
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,621
will be shown from multiple angles.

390
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:25,844
And by no means are these views accurate representations

391
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:28,966
of the final animation, what they will look like.

392
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:31,989
But it's a really good way of gut checking your work

393
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:32,889
by eliminating depth.

394
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,732
It can help reveal posing mistakes and other flaws

395
00:18:35,772 --> 00:18:36,432
in your animation.

396
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:39,074
Here's an example of a pose that looks okay

397
00:18:39,114 --> 00:18:39,835
in perspective view.

398
00:18:42,077 --> 00:18:43,578
And look at it from front view,

399
00:18:43,718 --> 00:18:45,559
and we can see that the pose is off balance.

400
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,502
In orthographic view, it's really easy to correct this pose.

401
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,303
So let's do it.

402
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:50,803
Here we go.

403
00:18:53,314 --> 00:18:55,816
Orthographic cameras can also be used for tracking movement.

404
00:18:55,856 --> 00:18:58,319
Here's an example of a character flying through space.

405
00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:00,521
The animation is shown in normal perspective.

406
00:19:01,162 --> 00:19:03,104
Here it is from front and side, orthographic views.

407
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:05,807
And this is a really useful way of tracking arcs.

408
00:19:06,968 --> 00:19:08,530
And I can worry about making changes,

409
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,691
a dimension at a time.

410
00:19:10,772 --> 00:19:12,394
I can track gravity as well by looking

411
00:19:12,414 --> 00:19:13,936
at the vertical spacing between the keys.

412
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:20,506
You can also track him up top to see if he's moving in a straight line, and he is.

413
00:19:20,986 --> 00:19:24,191
And generally I found that overall if you can make your movement look pretty decent

414
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:28,618
inside front view and sometimes top, it'll generally look good in most angles.

415
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,444
You know, I found myself in the beginning not using orthographic cameras due to how

416
00:19:34,504 --> 00:19:37,767
inconvenient the interface was. Maybe it was because it took too many clicks.

417
00:19:38,968 --> 00:19:43,233
I've then, I've since created myself hotkeys to quickly switch between the different viewports.

418
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:48,058
So, and, you know, definitely something I use every day and I'll include a link

419
00:19:48,598 --> 00:19:50,961
to the scripts and hotkeys at the end of this. So.

420
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:56,072
Let's see, to summarize what I just rambled about. Draw on your monitor using dry erase

421
00:19:56,112 --> 00:20:02,335
markers. Use evenly spaced key frames. Use orthographic cameras. And if you wish, follow

422
00:20:02,355 --> 00:20:06,597
this link and it should take you to my scripts. Thanks for your time. And next up, talented Kyle

423
00:20:06,817 --> 00:20:07,117
Chittenden.

424
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,483
Okay, hi, my name is Kyle Chittenden,

425
00:20:17,543 --> 00:20:18,664
I work at Certain Affinity,

426
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:21,306
and today I will be talking to you about animation tests.

427
00:20:22,027 --> 00:20:23,668
Animation tests, we all do them.

428
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:25,990
We all lose countless hours of sleep doing them.

429
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:27,612
And at the end of the test,

430
00:20:27,652 --> 00:20:29,593
we all feel like we needed more time

431
00:20:29,673 --> 00:20:30,654
and it could have been so much more.

432
00:20:31,508 --> 00:20:33,750
But we go to bed fairly happy with our completed animation

433
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,432
until we wake up literally three days later

434
00:20:37,012 --> 00:20:38,974
and come to fool ourselves into thinking

435
00:20:39,014 --> 00:20:41,335
that what we've just submitted was utter trash.

436
00:20:41,996 --> 00:20:43,577
So if you're a student looking for a job,

437
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,958
an employee looking for a new work,

438
00:20:45,018 --> 00:20:45,979
or someone who just got laid off

439
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:47,360
and is maybe looking for their next step,

440
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,582
listen up because I've been where you've been

441
00:20:49,822 --> 00:20:51,563
and through it all I've learned some important things.

442
00:20:51,943 --> 00:20:53,665
So here are my animation tips and tricks

443
00:20:53,905 --> 00:20:55,686
that have helped me out through the painful moments

444
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:56,747
of animation tests.

445
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,188
Pre-production.

446
00:20:59,146 --> 00:21:02,577
Pre-production is like your best friend, an adorable pet, and a pint of ice cream all

447
00:21:02,617 --> 00:21:04,563
combined into one delicious Palico companion.

448
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:09,831
I urge you to take a good chunk of your time for pre-production in searching for references

449
00:21:09,951 --> 00:21:11,091
relevant to what you're animating.

450
00:21:11,412 --> 00:21:12,652
Don't know where to look for references?

451
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:13,793
Well, I've got good news for you.

452
00:21:14,654 --> 00:21:16,094
You can basically look anywhere.

453
00:21:16,435 --> 00:21:20,417
Games, movies, novels, comics, videos of you doing the actions, indoors, outdoors.

454
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:23,299
Honestly, you can put your dog in a mo-cap suit and film him.

455
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,522
Anything to make sure that you have the best animation background possible to what the

456
00:21:27,562 --> 00:21:28,222
test entails.

457
00:21:28,622 --> 00:21:32,024
Now, also, while you're doing this, be sure to come up with a background bio for your

458
00:21:32,044 --> 00:21:32,365
character.

459
00:21:32,805 --> 00:21:33,926
if they don't already have one.

460
00:21:34,407 --> 00:21:36,269
This will help you a ton in knowing how they interact

461
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:37,030
with their environment.

462
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:39,593
Ask questions like, what are their motivations?

463
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:41,134
What are their strengths and weaknesses?

464
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,057
What are their current views on net neutrality

465
00:21:43,097 --> 00:21:44,118
and the authorities that govern it?

466
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:46,480
The deeper you delve into the character's background,

467
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,262
the more you can give them a unique personality

468
00:21:48,343 --> 00:21:50,064
and an animation test that defines who they are.

469
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:53,853
Second tip, double-up on controllers to avoid gimbal lock.

470
00:21:54,453 --> 00:21:56,013
All right, so if you're an animator like me,

471
00:21:56,073 --> 00:21:58,434
then you love doing animations full of flips and spins.

472
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:01,015
However, if you're only using one controller to do this,

473
00:22:01,115 --> 00:22:03,016
then you might notice something a little bit unnatural.

474
00:22:03,436 --> 00:22:04,597
And this is because of gimbal lock,

475
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:07,258
which gives priority to an axis while rotating an object.

476
00:22:07,758 --> 00:22:09,859
If you're having gimbal lock issues during flips and spins

477
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:11,559
and you can't send it back to a rigger to fix it,

478
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:13,280
such as during an animation test,

479
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,281
well then, you might wanna try out this simple trick.

480
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,962
Create a new noob circle and scale it so you can easily see it around your character.

481
00:22:19,562 --> 00:22:22,823
Then parent the original master controller to the new controller you just created.

482
00:22:23,783 --> 00:22:26,584
Use one controller for all the flips and the other controller for all the spins.

483
00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:30,726
Because you're dedicating each controller to rotate in only one direction, gimbal locks

484
00:22:30,746 --> 00:22:35,227
shouldn't be a problem anymore and you can go about making your sweet animation.

485
00:22:35,607 --> 00:22:37,268
Use reactive objects to clarify animations.

486
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:41,503
Okay, so a test entails that you have a two-prong combo attack, but you're not really sure if

487
00:22:41,563 --> 00:22:43,485
everybody is able to see the second attack land.

488
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:46,488
Well, the first thing you want to make sure of is that you clearly portray that second

489
00:22:46,508 --> 00:22:47,148
attack landing.

490
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,972
However, if you're still a little bit paranoid, then it doesn't hurt to add a static mesh

491
00:22:51,633 --> 00:22:53,034
that reacts to the character's attacks.

492
00:22:53,495 --> 00:22:56,578
So go ahead and make a mesh and have it represent the enemy.

493
00:22:57,099 --> 00:23:00,142
It doesn't need any crazy animation, just make sure that you give it a representation

494
00:23:00,182 --> 00:23:00,482
of weight.

495
00:23:01,283 --> 00:23:05,868
This is cool also because depending on how much weight you give it can show how much power each attack has when it lands.

496
00:23:06,488 --> 00:23:12,494
Lastly, play-blast the animation and send it into the company noting that the mesh is there as a representation of the enemy.

497
00:23:13,235 --> 00:23:17,740
This lessens your anxiety and shows that you were thinking of how to do the attack with an enemy in mind the whole time.

498
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:20,716
Four, twinning the correct way.

499
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:22,437
No, I'm not talking about twins here.

500
00:23:22,477 --> 00:23:24,638
I'm talking about when two objects move in parallel

501
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:25,459
at the same time.

502
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:27,220
Thank you, Mr. Obama, for demonstrating.

503
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,001
If you're an animator, new or old,

504
00:23:29,061 --> 00:23:31,282
then you've probably heard that twinning is bad.

505
00:23:31,403 --> 00:23:33,024
However, I'm here to tell you it isn't,

506
00:23:33,164 --> 00:23:34,284
as long as you do it correctly.

507
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:36,446
Tim Ritter goes into this concept more in depth,

508
00:23:36,486 --> 00:23:38,927
but let me reiterate that if you're twinning, that's okay.

509
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:40,789
Just make sure that you're breaking up the animation

510
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:41,429
to account for it.

511
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:44,629
Space your timing so that the poses land at separate times,

512
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:46,531
lead the motions into different directions,

513
00:23:46,951 --> 00:23:48,052
offset one part of the body

514
00:23:48,212 --> 00:23:50,615
so that it makes the character less symmetrical,

515
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,157
avoid consecutive twinning poses throughout the shot,

516
00:23:53,538 --> 00:23:54,919
and be intentional with your movements.

517
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,162
Many successful games and animations in movies

518
00:23:58,202 --> 00:23:59,163
have done this successfully,

519
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:00,405
so you'll be in good hands

520
00:24:00,425 --> 00:24:01,386
when you're trying it out for yourself.

521
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:05,533
And also, and lastly, don't commit until you're ready.

522
00:24:05,974 --> 00:24:07,054
This isn't marriage advice,

523
00:24:07,094 --> 00:24:09,296
this is advice on when you should start a test.

524
00:24:09,957 --> 00:24:11,618
If you're currently in the middle of finals week,

525
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:12,679
if you're crunching at work,

526
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,180
or if things just feel a little bit more hectic than usual,

527
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:16,862
don't start an animation test.

528
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:18,843
Companies will often send you a test

529
00:24:18,863 --> 00:24:20,545
and give you an allotted amount of time to do it.

530
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:22,806
However, they're usually pretty flexible

531
00:24:22,846 --> 00:24:24,367
about when you could start the test itself.

532
00:24:25,168 --> 00:24:26,109
Take them up on their offer,

533
00:24:26,189 --> 00:24:27,630
and don't be afraid to say that you'd like

534
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,531
to start the test a few days down the road.

535
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,684
Also, if there are other candidates trying to take the test the same time as you, they're

536
00:24:33,704 --> 00:24:34,764
not going to pass you up in line.

537
00:24:35,124 --> 00:24:37,585
As long as your animation is good, that's what matters.

538
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:41,166
And the only way you can make the animation the best it can be is if you have the time

539
00:24:41,386 --> 00:24:42,606
to commit to it fully.

540
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:44,347
And that's my talk.

541
00:24:44,627 --> 00:24:47,387
Hopefully these tips will help you, as they have helped me.

542
00:24:47,868 --> 00:24:51,709
And if you didn't like it and you fell asleep throughout the presentation, well then hopefully

543
00:24:51,729 --> 00:24:53,589
I've at least assisted you in a five minute nap.

544
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:54,269
All right.

545
00:24:54,309 --> 00:24:55,450
Lastly is Gwyn Frey.

546
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:55,770
Thank you.

547
00:25:00,047 --> 00:25:01,288
There is one rule.

548
00:25:01,308 --> 00:25:06,092
All right.

549
00:25:06,252 --> 00:25:06,952
My name is Gwen.

550
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:08,293
I am a technical animator.

551
00:25:08,453 --> 00:25:10,795
I am a studio founder for the Molasses Flood,

552
00:25:11,015 --> 00:25:12,636
and I'm the sole animator there.

553
00:25:12,997 --> 00:25:14,097
I'm going to showcase tips and tricks

554
00:25:14,117 --> 00:25:16,679
I used while working on this character, Scout.

555
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:19,181
She's a prototype character we had in game.

556
00:25:19,361 --> 00:25:21,403
Or she's just a prototype character we had.

557
00:25:22,143 --> 00:25:23,264
When I started out with her, I wanted

558
00:25:23,284 --> 00:25:25,065
to make a character that had absolutely no transition

559
00:25:25,085 --> 00:25:25,806
animations at all.

560
00:25:26,196 --> 00:25:29,819
A transition animation is an animation that takes you from one loop, like a run or a walk,

561
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:31,100
to another loop, like an idle.

562
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,403
It tends to slow down your iteration because you have to update it every time you update

563
00:25:34,423 --> 00:25:34,903
either loop.

564
00:25:35,324 --> 00:25:38,326
Instead, for her, she has four animations total for her locomotion.

565
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:42,549
An idle, a run, a walk, and a kind of hard stop animation.

566
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,613
If you look at this video, you'll see that the moment Scout stops moving, the foot she

567
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:48,534
has planted on the ground still stays on the ground.

568
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:52,257
The foot that's in the air plants, and she'll shift her weight onto the newly planted foot,

569
00:25:52,338 --> 00:25:54,139
and then slide the foot that's on the ground.

570
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:56,553
to match where it needs to be for the idle location.

571
00:25:57,213 --> 00:25:59,314
The way I did this is I made two float tracks

572
00:25:59,414 --> 00:26:02,276
in the walk and the run cycles.

573
00:26:03,476 --> 00:26:04,697
One float track is for the left foot

574
00:26:04,737 --> 00:26:05,757
and one is for the right foot.

575
00:26:06,078 --> 00:26:08,679
And they'll blend from one when the foot

576
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:10,980
is planted on the ground to zero when the foot is in the air.

577
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,181
Whenever the scout stops moving,

578
00:26:13,241 --> 00:26:14,782
I freeze her locomotion animation

579
00:26:14,822 --> 00:26:16,122
and I can query these two tracks

580
00:26:16,182 --> 00:26:18,043
to see if a foot is planted on the ground or not.

581
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:21,505
I also added a remain planted float track

582
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:22,705
to the hard stop animation.

583
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:25,150
This track is one for the first half of the animation

584
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,252
and blends to zero over the time I wanted to move

585
00:26:27,292 --> 00:26:29,493
her planted foot to the idle location.

586
00:26:30,014 --> 00:26:33,136
Now all I have to do is multiply that is planted float track

587
00:26:33,296 --> 00:26:35,438
for each foot by the remain planted track

588
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:36,558
in the hard stop animation.

589
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:39,580
And I can use that to drive the blend

590
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,001
for the IK target bones.

591
00:26:41,702 --> 00:26:43,243
I just said I'm using IK target bones,

592
00:26:43,263 --> 00:26:44,284
let's talk about IK.

593
00:26:45,084 --> 00:26:46,705
This strategy requires that I have IK running

594
00:26:46,725 --> 00:26:47,726
on my character at all times.

595
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:48,927
This is pretty typical for me.

596
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:51,068
And I tend to set up IK in a similar fashion

597
00:26:51,108 --> 00:26:52,109
for all of my characters.

598
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,322
I have bones in the rig for the leg IK targets.

599
00:26:55,582 --> 00:26:57,443
These bones are constrained to the ankle bones

600
00:26:57,503 --> 00:26:59,204
but parented under the root of the character.

601
00:26:59,805 --> 00:27:00,706
Since these are in the rig,

602
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:02,787
they're automatically exported for every animation I make.

603
00:27:02,907 --> 00:27:05,209
So anytime in engine I need to figure out

604
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:06,930
where the feet should be in root relative space,

605
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,871
I can just query the location of these bones.

606
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,253
I also have bones parented under the pole vectors

607
00:27:12,273 --> 00:27:12,974
for the leg IK.

608
00:27:13,034 --> 00:27:14,275
I figure we're, as animators,

609
00:27:14,295 --> 00:27:15,576
we're already managing the pole vector.

610
00:27:15,616 --> 00:27:17,957
We might as well bring that information into the game,

611
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:20,899
into the engine, and use that to drive our pole vectors

612
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,240
for the in-game IK as well.

613
00:27:23,882 --> 00:27:26,344
I use IK for run stop, but I use it for all kinds of other things as well.

614
00:27:26,424 --> 00:27:30,026
Here I'm using it to make a quick and dirty kind of slope variation for all of our locomotion.

615
00:27:30,466 --> 00:27:34,748
All I did here was I took the IK target bones, parented them under a world orientation bone,

616
00:27:35,148 --> 00:27:39,010
and every tick I cast a ray down to the world and find the normal angle of the world to

617
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,291
set the orientation of this bone.

618
00:27:40,731 --> 00:27:45,334
This will obviously orient the IK feet to the ground.

619
00:27:45,954 --> 00:27:50,417
You'll notice if you're watching here very carefully that as her feet approach the ground,

620
00:27:50,517 --> 00:27:53,718
they blend into the IK and they blend out whenever she takes her feet off of the ground.

621
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,873
Also, whenever she's jumping, for instance,

622
00:27:56,254 --> 00:27:57,414
in-game IK will turn off.

623
00:27:58,014 --> 00:27:58,975
Guess how I'm doing that?

624
00:27:59,415 --> 00:28:01,095
I'm exporting that from Maya as well.

625
00:28:01,496 --> 00:28:05,757
So I actually export the blend between IK and FK in Maya,

626
00:28:05,957 --> 00:28:09,338
and I have that float track drive the in-game IK in Engine.

627
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:13,040
What this means is, when I'm animating something

628
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,121
like this jump here, I'm thinking,

629
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:17,942
as I blend from FK to IK, that

630
00:28:18,318 --> 00:28:22,820
her feet in IK might be slightly manipulated by slope variation or something else in game.

631
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,500
I just keep that in mind as I animate.

632
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:30,843
Speaking of jumps, for a traditional jump, you have a looping fall animation,

633
00:28:30,903 --> 00:28:34,124
and then you kind of hit the ground and you blend really quickly into this landing animation.

634
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:36,665
You don't have a lot of frames to play with if you do that.

635
00:28:36,705 --> 00:28:38,466
You can't really give the character a lot of weight.

636
00:28:38,966 --> 00:28:40,467
I generally think this kind of looks bad.

637
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:44,648
I saw a talk that Loren did for Paragon, and I kind of stole his idea.

638
00:28:45,544 --> 00:28:48,206
Instead, I animate the land from a much higher point off of the ground,

639
00:28:48,246 --> 00:28:50,528
and I have her feet reach through the collision cylinder

640
00:28:50,568 --> 00:28:54,090
and touch the ground before she actually makes contact with the ground.

641
00:28:55,111 --> 00:28:56,412
I don't actually play this animation.

642
00:28:56,772 --> 00:28:59,454
What I do is I query the distance she is from the ground,

643
00:28:59,854 --> 00:29:02,056
and I use that to select a frame of this animation.

644
00:29:03,117 --> 00:29:05,819
So, to reiterate, that animation happened,

645
00:29:06,139 --> 00:29:08,120
it started with her 100 units off of the ground.

646
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:11,103
So, in Engine, what I'm doing is I'm detecting

647
00:29:11,963 --> 00:29:13,724
how far she's off of the ground, dividing that by 100.

648
00:29:14,532 --> 00:29:16,093
and playing the frame that is that percentage

649
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:16,953
through the animation.

650
00:29:17,293 --> 00:29:18,554
This animation does not play.

651
00:29:19,154 --> 00:29:21,416
I am selecting a frame of the animation

652
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,377
based on an input variable, which is in this case,

653
00:29:24,418 --> 00:29:25,458
the distance from the ground.

654
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:27,659
This is important because, like, say,

655
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,380
she could be falling at different velocities,

656
00:29:29,681 --> 00:29:30,701
they could manipulate the arcs.

657
00:29:30,741 --> 00:29:32,062
It doesn't matter what the designer does,

658
00:29:32,182 --> 00:29:33,563
because the animation is data-driven,

659
00:29:33,863 --> 00:29:35,384
her feet will never penetrate through the ground.

660
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,465
I use this concept for all kinds of things.

661
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,907
For instance, I dislike how turn-and-place animations

662
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:40,627
are usually set up.

663
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:41,668
It's usually a lot of

664
00:29:42,287 --> 00:29:43,907
different footfall animations blending together

665
00:29:43,927 --> 00:29:44,788
in some kind of hot mess.

666
00:29:45,388 --> 00:29:47,488
Instead of that, what I did for her was

667
00:29:47,989 --> 00:29:49,369
I made one turn-in-place animation

668
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:51,350
that turns her 360 degrees.

669
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,511
And I queried the world space orientation

670
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:55,431
of Scout at all times.

671
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:58,652
And I used that orientation to drive the frame

672
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:00,273
that I'm selecting of this animation.

673
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:04,715
So for instance, as she's turning,

674
00:30:05,075 --> 00:30:07,476
and the engine detects that she's turning left or right,

675
00:30:08,376 --> 00:30:10,397
this animation will play forwards or backwards.

676
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:13,052
I'm constantly selecting a frame of this animation

677
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:14,592
based on her world space orientation.

678
00:30:14,892 --> 00:30:15,633
What you're seeing right here

679
00:30:15,673 --> 00:30:17,213
is actually only three animations.

680
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,854
One where she has her feet moving,

681
00:30:20,094 --> 00:30:22,295
one where an identical animation to that,

682
00:30:22,715 --> 00:30:24,136
that just has her feet planted on the ground

683
00:30:24,176 --> 00:30:27,037
that I blend to anytime the world orientation

684
00:30:27,077 --> 00:30:27,737
is not changing.

685
00:30:28,157 --> 00:30:30,218
And then an additive idle that plays over the whole setup.

686
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:31,818
So with three animations,

687
00:30:31,878 --> 00:30:35,400
I can actually make a pretty decent turn in place.

688
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,120
