1
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:09,009
My name is Ken Wong, and I'm the creative director and founder

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,113
of a little development studio called Mountains.

3
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:13,935
Our debut game, Florence, came out

4
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:16,177
on Valentine's Day last year.

5
00:00:16,177 --> 00:00:17,979
I was the game's designer, and I also worked

6
00:00:17,979 --> 00:00:19,420
on a lot of the art and story.

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,523
I'm excited to be here today to share with you

8
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,425
some of the things that I learned

9
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:25,326
from working on this game.

10
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:27,469
And there's lots of spoilers coming up,

11
00:00:27,469 --> 00:00:28,990
so I hope that you've all played the game.

12
00:00:29,954 --> 00:00:34,618
I have a lot to talk about, so we're probably not going to get time for questions, but I'm

13
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:39,081
going to stick around in the breakout alcove later on.

14
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:44,245
So if you want to follow up with me, just hang around and we'll go out there.

15
00:00:44,245 --> 00:00:48,208
And please remember to fill out your feedback surveys afterwards.

16
00:00:48,208 --> 00:00:54,133
So the plan for today, first of all I want to talk about the setup of this project, like

17
00:00:54,133 --> 00:00:54,733
how it came to be.

18
00:00:56,112 --> 00:01:00,693
Next, I'd like to talk about the evolution of the game idea, as it changed quite a lot

19
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:01,874
throughout the development.

20
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:06,775
Then we're going to look at some of the highlights of the narrative design and the interaction

21
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:07,815
design.

22
00:01:07,815 --> 00:01:12,617
And I'd finally like to wrap up with sharing a couple of the other takeaways and lessons.

23
00:01:12,617 --> 00:01:17,158
But first of all, let's talk about how this project came to be.

24
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:24,847
So five years ago, I had the great privilege of working on Monument Valley as the lead

25
00:01:24,847 --> 00:01:26,308
designer for us two games.

26
00:01:26,308 --> 00:01:31,813
Monument Valley is kind of an unconventional mobile game in many ways.

27
00:01:31,813 --> 00:01:34,556
At 90 minutes, it's a very short game.

28
00:01:34,556 --> 00:01:39,741
It looks like a puzzle game, but it's actually really easy, and it's more about the journey

29
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:41,002
than the reward at the end.

30
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:45,100
It's a quiet and a relaxing experience.

31
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,401
And from top to bottom we designed this game not for gamers, but for people that don't

32
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,122
usually play games.

33
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:57,144
And the game's success gave me confidence that mobile players want high quality experiences.

34
00:01:57,144 --> 00:02:04,406
It gave me the confidence in myself as a designer and my ability to make bold design decisions.

35
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:11,184
I decided that the next challenge that I wanted to take on was starting my own studio.

36
00:02:11,184 --> 00:02:17,208
So three years ago, I moved from London to Melbourne and started Mountains.

37
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:25,073
This is our producer, Kamina, myself, programmer Sam, and lead programmer Tony.

38
00:02:25,073 --> 00:02:29,596
Because of the success of Monument Valley, I was able to secure a partnership with Annapurna.

39
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,806
And at the time, their new interactive division

40
00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:34,207
had not yet released any games.

41
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:38,830
But the team included former members of Sony Santa Monica,

42
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,233
who published Journey, Her Hercum, and more.

43
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:45,755
When I met with them, I felt like we shared the same goals,

44
00:02:45,755 --> 00:02:49,398
to make beautiful, unique games.

45
00:02:49,398 --> 00:02:51,259
So we signed up.

46
00:02:51,259 --> 00:02:54,361
And I faced a lot of challenges when I was starting the studio.

47
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:56,643
But fortunately, funding and publishing

48
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,945
were sort of taken care of from the start.

49
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:08,182
In my opinion, many of the aspects of how we made games that us two worked really well

50
00:03:08,182 --> 00:03:09,123
for a certain type of game.

51
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:11,563
And I wanted to carry these over to my new studio.

52
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:17,264
Probably the most important of those is lots of iteration.

53
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:23,066
We want to make innovative games and often that means taking a couple of tries to get

54
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:23,826
something right.

55
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:30,252
Our planning includes lots of room for failure because failure helps us gain the knowledge

56
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,776
and understanding about the thing that we're making.

57
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:38,164
To support this process, we do a lot of user testing.

58
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:40,825
We're not especially rigorous about it,

59
00:03:40,825 --> 00:03:42,546
just friends and other game developers

60
00:03:42,546 --> 00:03:44,847
who come to visit the studio.

61
00:03:44,847 --> 00:03:47,368
But we don't usually tell these play testers anything

62
00:03:47,368 --> 00:03:50,429
about the game, and we don't tell them how to play.

63
00:03:50,429 --> 00:03:53,250
They should be able to work all of this out from the game

64
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,851
itself, as they would as a regular customer.

65
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:56,231
And lastly, we think that short games are OK.

66
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:56,331
Like.

67
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:05,893
it's okay to make shorter experiences.

68
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:08,614
Monument Valley taught me that there are many busy people

69
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:11,315
out there that would rather have an experience

70
00:04:11,315 --> 00:04:13,696
that's short but higher quality throughout.

71
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:18,477
I had hoped to keep productions short and tight

72
00:04:18,477 --> 00:04:21,779
at Mountains, I actually wrote into our employee handbook

73
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,540
that Mountains would ship a game roughly every 12 months.

74
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,042
And this is how Florence actually turned out, 22 months.

75
00:04:30,143 --> 00:04:35,366
The first six months could be described as a period of ideation.

76
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:39,868
We went through several different prototypes just to figure out what game we wanted to

77
00:04:39,868 --> 00:04:39,948
make.

78
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:47,112
It then took a further nine months before we could play through this game, this experience

79
00:04:47,112 --> 00:04:53,915
from start to finish, and to learn how to make a good chapter of Florence.

80
00:04:53,915 --> 00:04:58,018
And then finally it took about seven months of revisions and polish to bring the game

81
00:04:58,018 --> 00:04:58,498
to launch.

82
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:04,385
When I started Mountains, I didn't have in my mind

83
00:05:04,385 --> 00:05:07,347
a particular game that I wanted to make.

84
00:05:07,347 --> 00:05:10,088
Now, of course, over the years, I'd built up a long list

85
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:13,649
of game ideas that I would love to make one day,

86
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:17,171
but I didn't know which one of these would be a great fit

87
00:05:17,171 --> 00:05:19,812
for this team with this budget at this time.

88
00:05:21,284 --> 00:05:25,905
I think having a clear vision for what you want to make can be a great benefit,

89
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:30,007
but I also think it's valid to find the idea organically

90
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:33,048
through a process of experimentation and discussion,

91
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:36,729
and that was the case with Florence.

92
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:41,730
Instead of a game, I had a starting point, an area for investigation.

93
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:47,712
And what that was, was manipulation of 3D objects on a touch screen.

94
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:52,523
I feel like a handful of games have actually pulled this off,

95
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:54,604
including The Room and Shadowmatic.

96
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,246
But I wanted to see if we could find our own solution

97
00:05:58,246 --> 00:06:00,247
to this particular challenge.

98
00:06:00,247 --> 00:06:06,370
Our first prototype to explore this was called Parade.

99
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,412
Parade could probably have become a decent game.

100
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:12,793
But I realized I wanted more than just solid mechanics

101
00:06:12,793 --> 00:06:13,794
and good level design.

102
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:16,575
I wanted to make an emotional impact.

103
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:22,247
So our next prototype included a more human element,

104
00:06:22,247 --> 00:06:23,848
human heads.

105
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:25,929
The idea was to put human heads together

106
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:28,610
like 3D jigsaw puzzles or like Rubik's cubes.

107
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,351
I thought that this mechanic would allow us

108
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:34,333
to explore identity and psychology.

109
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,934
I thought it was pretty cool,

110
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:40,615
but once you put one human head together,

111
00:06:40,615 --> 00:06:43,137
doing more heads just kind of felt like more of the same.

112
00:06:45,794 --> 00:06:49,155
I still thought that the idea of 3D jigsaw puzzles had potential,

113
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:54,896
so I came up with a list of five things that we could use 3D puzzles for,

114
00:06:54,896 --> 00:07:00,338
and what the team really honed in on was a game about a relationship between two people.

115
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:04,639
If I were to write out what the concept of the game was at this point,

116
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,900
it would be the story of a relationship told through 3D jigsaw puzzles.

117
00:07:11,435 --> 00:07:14,697
We would reuse the structure of Monument Valley,

118
00:07:14,697 --> 00:07:17,019
a linear series of chapters,

119
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:19,240
and each chapter would be a variation

120
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,943
on a 3D jigsaw puzzle as a metaphor

121
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:26,085
for the high and low moments in a relationship.

122
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:28,446
It had taken us six months just to reach this point,

123
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:31,508
and throughout this process,

124
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:33,630
Annapurna seemed to be patient.

125
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,170
Thanks, Hector.

126
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:38,053
They know that you need to break a lot of eggs

127
00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:39,694
in order to make a hit indie omelet.

128
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:46,086
But the next nine months were a real uphill battle.

129
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:52,230
I slowly realized that my initial exploration direction of 3D manipulation was just not

130
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,410
going to work out.

131
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:59,494
It turns out it's really awkward to manipulate 3D objects on a touch screen, and the third

132
00:07:59,494 --> 00:08:03,677
dimension actually wasn't adding anything to the storytelling.

133
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:05,458
So we switched to 2D puzzles.

134
00:08:06,397 --> 00:08:12,368
They were clearer and more straightforward, but our concept of the game was becoming simpler

135
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:13,210
and simpler.

136
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,158
And I was wondering, is this what Anna Burna had signed up for?

137
00:08:19,822 --> 00:08:23,665
We also really struggled with how to make a good chapter of Florence.

138
00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:28,129
It felt like for every four ideas we had, three wouldn't work.

139
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:34,713
We'd spend two or three weeks creating a chapter prototype, only to find out that the emotion

140
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:36,315
or the story just didn't come across.

141
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:41,779
Sometimes we would have to throw away all of that code and all of that art and start

142
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:43,000
again with a different approach.

143
00:08:44,746 --> 00:08:48,048
As the game designer and the founder of this young studio,

144
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:50,149
it was really disheartening work.

145
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:53,150
Everyone around me was really supportive,

146
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,492
but I couldn't help but feel like my team and my publisher,

147
00:08:56,492 --> 00:09:00,494
they were trusting in me and I was leading them down

148
00:09:00,494 --> 00:09:01,094
the path to disaster.

149
00:09:01,094 --> 00:09:06,117
But gradually, we found mechanics that did work.

150
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:08,258
A few chapters started to feel really strong,

151
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:11,060
like they would actually make it into the final game.

152
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,862
More and more levels started to not be jigsaw puzzles at all,

153
00:09:15,862 --> 00:09:19,903
and we opened ourselves to using whatever mechanic was needed

154
00:09:19,903 --> 00:09:24,165
in order to tell that story beat.

155
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:27,606
We also let go of the idea of each chapter

156
00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:28,907
just being one mechanic.

157
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:32,428
Instead, each chapter became like a container

158
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:35,289
that could contain one mechanic or several,

159
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:38,550
interspersed with non-interactive image panels.

160
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,931
The game kind of...

161
00:09:41,739 --> 00:09:44,761
began to resemble a cross between WarioWare

162
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:46,861
and an interactive comic book,

163
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:49,383
and I began to use storyboards like these

164
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:51,163
to plan the chapters.

165
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:54,625
You could now describe the game

166
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:56,646
as the story of a relationship

167
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:59,447
told through different touchscreen mechanics.

168
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:06,571
In July of 2017, 15 months since we started the company,

169
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:08,952
we could finally play through the game

170
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:11,133
from start to finish in a very rough form.

171
00:10:12,327 --> 00:10:14,149
It wasn't good yet.

172
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:17,171
Many of the emotional beats just didn't land,

173
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:20,394
and the ending just didn't feel right.

174
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:22,896
But I now had a complete first draft

175
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:26,399
that worked well enough that I could reflect upon it

176
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,920
and start improving.

177
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,462
And at this point, I was confident

178
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:32,744
that some version of this game would actually ship.

179
00:10:32,744 --> 00:10:37,368
Let's rewind a little bit and talk about narrative.

180
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:43,030
I personally don't enjoy most narrative games.

181
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,952
I don't have anything against them, they're just not my cup of tea.

182
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:50,194
But sometimes not being a fan of something can be an advantage.

183
00:10:50,194 --> 00:10:58,620
Game designer Zach Gage does not like word games, so he made a word game that he felt

184
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,021
addressed some of the genre's shortcomings.

185
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:04,543
The result is Spell Tower, which is really, really good.

186
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:11,755
So sometimes I think a skeptic or an outsider is able to find a different way of doing things,

187
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:16,940
perhaps an approach that the genre enthusiasts missed.

188
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,324
So when I talk about narrative in Florence, I'm really coming from the perspective of

189
00:11:21,324 --> 00:11:26,609
someone who doesn't enjoy most narrative games, but who loves other forms of narrative, like

190
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:30,372
film and podcasts and all forms of visual storytelling.

191
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:37,558
One of the first tasks to do with narrative was to cast our two main characters.

192
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:43,400
My first instinct was to try and make them as blank as possible.

193
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:49,562
Maybe never give them names and no particular character traits and make them ethnically

194
00:11:49,562 --> 00:11:50,282
ambiguous.

195
00:11:50,282 --> 00:11:56,724
I thought at the time that making them as generic as possible would sort of make them

196
00:11:56,724 --> 00:11:59,925
as relatable as possible to the widest audience.

197
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:06,355
I can't remember how we got the idea in our head to go in the opposite direction,

198
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:09,357
to make these characters very specific.

199
00:12:09,357 --> 00:12:14,542
Perhaps we found it difficult to write a story for characters with no personalities,

200
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:21,027
or maybe we just realized that creating an average person is just impossible.

201
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:24,730
I found guidance on this topic in an interview with Constance Wu

202
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,872
about her television show Fresh Off the Boat.

203
00:12:27,925 --> 00:12:33,590
She talked about the impossibility of representing all Asian Americans in just one show.

204
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:39,796
The pressure only existed because there was only one show depicting the Asian American

205
00:12:39,796 --> 00:12:42,138
experience.

206
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:47,843
But what they could do was tell an authentic story about one particular Asian American

207
00:12:47,843 --> 00:12:48,423
family.

208
00:12:49,673 --> 00:12:56,817
By making these fictional characters specific, detailed, flawed, deep characters,

209
00:12:56,817 --> 00:13:03,260
they honored the complex and the varied lives of real Asian Americans.

210
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,643
So, as the primary writer, I decided to fill the characters with details

211
00:13:08,643 --> 00:13:12,025
from my own experiences and those of my friends and family.

212
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:16,492
Establishing our characters' ethnic backgrounds

213
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:21,617
helped anchor their identities and inform their relationship.

214
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:24,519
Like me, Florence was born in Australia

215
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:29,343
to ethnically Chinese parents who emigrated from Malaysia.

216
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:33,246
Her surname, Yo, is my mother's maiden name.

217
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:35,228
Like many of my female Asian friends,

218
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:37,750
Florence has a sometimes tense relationship

219
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,432
with her mother, who she only speaks to in Cantonese.

220
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:44,194
Krish, on the other hand, is Indian-Australian.

221
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:47,655
I love the idea of a dark-skinned, hairy,

222
00:13:47,655 --> 00:13:53,037
creative guy being our object of desire.

223
00:13:53,037 --> 00:13:56,518
Krish's family is based on the family of a Sri Lankan friend

224
00:13:56,518 --> 00:13:58,919
from high school, and his surname

225
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,879
comes from one of our producers at Annapurna.

226
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,801
My South Asian friends all told me

227
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:07,342
that Krish would probably be very close to his family.

228
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:13,296
So Krish introduces Florence to his family early on in the relationship,

229
00:14:13,296 --> 00:14:17,760
while Florence keeps the whole relationship a secret from her mother.

230
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,306
Our couple happen to be two people of color, of different faiths,

231
00:14:24,306 --> 00:14:28,089
and they're the children of immigrants.

232
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:32,653
This is such a mundane, ordinary thing in Australia,

233
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:35,575
which is where we made this game, and where the game is set.

234
00:14:36,614 --> 00:14:42,397
Believe it or not, we exist, we have lives, and we fall in love.

235
00:14:42,397 --> 00:14:48,579
It's so normal, and yet this representation is meaningful because we're still not used

236
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:53,702
to seeing people of color and people of different faiths as the central characters in the stories

237
00:14:53,702 --> 00:14:55,182
that we tell.

238
00:14:55,182 --> 00:15:00,905
We received so many tweets and emails from people who played Florence, who felt themselves

239
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:03,086
represented in a video game for the first time.

240
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:12,163
Before I was a game designer, I was an artist, illustrator, and art director.

241
00:15:12,163 --> 00:15:16,046
Telling stories with pictures is my native language.

242
00:15:16,046 --> 00:15:21,250
That background really shaped how I designed games, and you can see that influence on Monument

243
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,832
Valley and also in Florence.

244
00:15:23,832 --> 00:15:30,217
Both games use almost no words, but make heavy use of visual composition, color, and music.

245
00:15:33,014 --> 00:15:36,918
It took us a long time to find the Florence art style.

246
00:15:36,918 --> 00:15:42,003
Here's a couple of experiments that happened along the way.

247
00:15:42,003 --> 00:15:43,724
In the one on the left, I'm definitely

248
00:15:43,724 --> 00:15:46,367
trying too hard to come up with a really unique art

249
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:47,308
style for this game.

250
00:15:47,308 --> 00:15:51,432
The other two are a bit more subtle,

251
00:15:51,432 --> 00:15:53,434
but I still don't think they quite set

252
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:54,555
the right tone for the story.

253
00:15:57,944 --> 00:16:02,205
I'm actually not very good at drawing the same thing over and over again,

254
00:16:02,205 --> 00:16:05,366
but, especially characters.

255
00:16:05,366 --> 00:16:08,866
I've never drawn a comic longer than a single page,

256
00:16:08,866 --> 00:16:11,647
so it wasn't immediately obvious to me that we should borrow

257
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:12,927
from the language of comic books.

258
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:18,468
But once we went down that direction, it totally made sense.

259
00:16:18,468 --> 00:16:22,429
I took visual cues from slice-of-life graphic novels and zines.

260
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,254
These would often feature incredibly personal narratives

261
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:30,176
and would often be printed with limited colors.

262
00:16:30,176 --> 00:16:34,000
The resulting art style is simple and ordinary

263
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,582
and it's kind of rough around the edges,

264
00:16:36,582 --> 00:16:39,984
but it brings a sense of vulnerability and authenticity.

265
00:16:39,984 --> 00:16:45,009
These two mock-up posters were some of the first images

266
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:48,411
that I drew in what became the final art style.

267
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:52,343
When I drew the poster on the right, I was like,

268
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:56,106
that's it, that's the hero image of the game.

269
00:16:56,106 --> 00:16:58,147
No other game looks like that,

270
00:16:58,147 --> 00:17:00,628
and I would love to see that as the banner

271
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:02,370
on the App Store one day.

272
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,390
Another consideration with the art style

273
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:08,453
was that many people would be playing this game

274
00:17:08,453 --> 00:17:09,794
on their phones.

275
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:14,777
A traditional comic page with like five or six panels

276
00:17:14,777 --> 00:17:18,079
on one page, that would feel quite cluttered

277
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,760
in this context.

278
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,932
and on this size of screen.

279
00:17:21,932 --> 00:17:24,374
So our comic strip sequences

280
00:17:24,374 --> 00:17:27,536
are almost all single width panels.

281
00:17:27,536 --> 00:17:30,699
They scroll up and down, more like a website

282
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:34,122
or like a social media feed than a comic book.

283
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:36,284
And this lets people focus on one image at a time.

284
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:42,389
Music, of course, plays a huge part in the story.

285
00:17:42,389 --> 00:17:45,412
And we were very fortunate to have Kevin Penkin on

286
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:46,493
as our composer.

287
00:17:47,561 --> 00:17:53,424
I could spend this whole talk on all the amazing things that his score does, but it's probably

288
00:17:53,424 --> 00:17:56,226
best that Kevin give that talk another time.

289
00:17:56,226 --> 00:18:02,349
Today I just want to touch on one aspect of the music, and that's that we realised that

290
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:05,971
the two main instruments could act as the voices for the characters.

291
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:11,794
We knew quite early on that Krish would play an instrument, which ended up being a cello.

292
00:18:13,235 --> 00:18:17,138
One of Kevin's first assignments was to write Krish's theme,

293
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:21,101
which is the music that you hear when Florence comes across him in the street.

294
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:27,806
You only hear the cello when Krish is around or when Florence is thinking of Krish.

295
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:33,410
Florence also has a theme, which actually comes from Kevin's audition track for this project.

296
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:38,053
It's played on piano, so the piano often serves as the voice for Florence.

297
00:18:39,623 --> 00:18:43,845
When it came time to write music for the character's first argument,

298
00:18:43,845 --> 00:18:48,607
I asked Kevin to just write a cello and a piano having an argument,

299
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:53,529
and it just worked perfectly.

300
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:58,191
A few months before launch, we had two curveballs

301
00:18:58,191 --> 00:19:01,892
to do with the narrative that we had to deal with.

302
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:06,894
The first was a conversation that we had about gender and sexuality.

303
00:19:07,923 --> 00:19:14,971
Anna Perna asked us if we would consider allowing the player to play as either a male or female

304
00:19:14,971 --> 00:19:16,873
version of the main character.

305
00:19:16,873 --> 00:19:24,902
And the player would also be able to pick the gender of the love interest.

306
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:30,047
Only the art assets would change, and the story would otherwise remain completely identical.

307
00:19:31,565 --> 00:19:33,767
Creating two different sets of assets

308
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:36,169
for these two characters would extend production,

309
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:39,532
so Annapurna was prepared to increase the budget.

310
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:40,913
And I was a bit shocked.

311
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:43,975
I didn't expect a publisher to ever propose

312
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:48,179
increasing the scope and budget of our game.

313
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:50,741
Internally at Mountains, we had discussed

314
00:19:50,741 --> 00:19:52,182
the topic of gender at the start of the project.

315
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:57,647
Arriving at a female protagonist and a male love interest

316
00:19:57,647 --> 00:20:00,109
was the result of many different considerations.

317
00:20:01,157 --> 00:20:06,399
For example, as the primary rider, I wanted to ride a straight couple because those are

318
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:08,679
the experiences that I know firsthand.

319
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:15,361
We liked having a female point of view character to add to the underrepresented field of female

320
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:21,343
protagonists in games, and we liked the idea of a male person of color as the love interest

321
00:20:21,343 --> 00:20:27,825
as they're also underrepresented, and it helped us avoid the trope of the manic pixie dream

322
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:28,145
girl.

323
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:32,226
But Anna Perna's suggestion asked us to revisit

324
00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:33,967
all of these decisions.

325
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:38,431
I think there's definitely a game to be made

326
00:20:38,431 --> 00:20:41,613
in the same mold as Florence, but with gender options.

327
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:44,155
Is that a better game?

328
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:45,696
Does it tell a better story?

329
00:20:45,696 --> 00:20:47,017
I don't know.

330
00:20:47,017 --> 00:20:50,520
Every member of our team cares about representation,

331
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,023
but as the designer, I'm not sure if making this change

332
00:20:55,023 --> 00:20:56,764
late in the game would have been

333
00:20:56,764 --> 00:20:58,065
the best way to achieve that.

334
00:20:59,028 --> 00:21:04,913
In the end, I made the call to stick with the path that we were on,

335
00:21:04,913 --> 00:21:07,936
and only a few months away from completing.

336
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:10,819
I had really come to know these two characters,

337
00:21:10,819 --> 00:21:14,062
and I really wanted to see their story through to the end.

338
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:19,967
The second late development was the rewriting of the ending.

339
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:27,703
Since the beginning of development, the story had always been about two people coming together,

340
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:33,686
breaking apart, and then, 30 years later, meeting again by chance.

341
00:21:33,686 --> 00:21:35,007
And we even prototyped this ending.

342
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:42,111
I wrote this version of the story when I was recovering from a really difficult breakup.

343
00:21:42,111 --> 00:21:47,274
But over the ensuing year of development, I'd gotten to know Florence really well.

344
00:21:47,274 --> 00:21:49,215
She felt like a real person to me.

345
00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:53,552
and I really wanted the best for her.

346
00:21:53,552 --> 00:21:56,414
Slowly, I understood what all of my teammates

347
00:21:56,414 --> 00:22:00,017
and collaborators had been pushing for this whole time.

348
00:22:00,017 --> 00:22:01,618
Florence's story shouldn't end

349
00:22:01,618 --> 00:22:04,120
with a chance reunion with Krish,

350
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,222
and it shouldn't end with her meeting someone else,

351
00:22:06,222 --> 00:22:10,045
someone new either.

352
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:13,607
All this time, I had told Florence to let go,

353
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:16,009
but then I always ended up leading her back to Krish.

354
00:22:16,943 --> 00:22:19,044
It turns out I was the one who needed to let go,

355
00:22:19,044 --> 00:22:23,106
to let go of this ending that had been so personal to me

356
00:22:23,106 --> 00:22:26,608
that I once thought was the reason that I wanted to tell a story at all.

357
00:22:26,608 --> 00:22:32,670
This part of Florence's life needed to end as it began,

358
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,671
with Florence by herself.

359
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:37,893
But because of the time that she shared with this really amazing person,

360
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:42,615
she became more confident, more independent, and more fulfilled.

361
00:22:44,955 --> 00:22:48,198
So how do we say goodbye to Krish?

362
00:22:48,198 --> 00:22:49,859
I really thought that was important.

363
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:55,483
The last time that we saw him, he was packing up his things on a rainy day, and he left

364
00:22:55,483 --> 00:22:56,904
his toothbrush behind.

365
00:22:56,904 --> 00:22:57,245
The worst.

366
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:58,205
So I wrote this tiny little goodbye.

367
00:22:58,205 --> 00:23:08,053
As Florence is clearing out her office, ready for the next stage in her life, she finds

368
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,454
an old photo of Krish.

369
00:23:10,632 --> 00:23:13,353
Florence smiles, it's a happy memory.

370
00:23:13,353 --> 00:23:16,374
We hear cello for the final time.

371
00:23:16,374 --> 00:23:19,975
She puts the photo in the box with the rest of her images,

372
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:26,178
the rest of her things from her past, and we close the lid.

373
00:23:26,178 --> 00:23:28,559
So let's move on to the final way

374
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,040
in which Florence tells a story, interaction design.

375
00:23:34,193 --> 00:23:40,815
In general, I think there are some ideas of what a video game is that could be summarized

376
00:23:40,815 --> 00:23:42,496
as traditionalist.

377
00:23:42,496 --> 00:23:47,437
I think a traditionalist might say that game mechanics should all be about challenge and

378
00:23:47,437 --> 00:23:54,739
skill, that games should be about choice and agency, and that games should last a few hours

379
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:55,379
long.

380
00:23:55,379 --> 00:24:01,880
That doesn't come from any particular manifesto or anything, that's just my impression.

381
00:24:02,777 --> 00:24:06,579
But I think that a lot of what being a creative and an artist

382
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:10,482
and a game designer is about is questioning assumptions

383
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,184
and searching for new perspectives.

384
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:15,466
Some of the insights that informed Florence

385
00:24:15,466 --> 00:24:18,728
are that game mechanics can be instead used

386
00:24:18,728 --> 00:24:22,912
to evoke a feeling or an idea, that we

387
00:24:22,912 --> 00:24:25,173
can use whatever game mechanic we need in order

388
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:28,556
to tell the story, and that games can be whatever length

389
00:24:28,556 --> 00:24:29,396
they need to be.

390
00:24:31,842 --> 00:24:34,422
Many of the games that have helped me question

391
00:24:34,422 --> 00:24:39,564
what a game is and what effect game mechanics have on us

392
00:24:39,564 --> 00:24:43,985
include Passage, Papers, Please, Gone Home, and Everything.

393
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:47,486
On this project, I was particularly inspired

394
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:54,108
by the vignette games of Jenny Jiaoxia and Nina Freeman.

395
00:24:54,108 --> 00:24:56,969
Jenny's game, Consume Me, is coming out soon.

396
00:24:57,867 --> 00:25:00,509
And remember, if you think it looks a bit like Florence,

397
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:02,910
it was her work that inspired ours,

398
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,091
and not the other way around.

399
00:25:06,091 --> 00:25:08,613
So let's take a look at how some of the mechanics

400
00:25:08,613 --> 00:25:09,313
of Florence work.

401
00:25:09,313 --> 00:25:13,495
None of the mechanics are what you would call deep

402
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:16,196
from a systemic point of view, but that's not the point.

403
00:25:17,013 --> 00:25:22,297
In vignette games, mechanics are often about evoking a feeling or an idea,

404
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:25,059
or perhaps bringing up similar memories that the player has,

405
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:29,482
and thereby creating an empathetic connection with the character.

406
00:25:29,482 --> 00:25:32,164
A great example is the toothbrush interaction.

407
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:36,728
It's such a simple action, but it says so many things at once.

408
00:25:36,728 --> 00:25:43,173
The interaction is not difficult at all, but it's repetitive enough to suggest

409
00:25:43,173 --> 00:25:45,875
monotonous work. The presence of a progress bar

410
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:50,406
signifies gamification, as if Florence is living life

411
00:25:50,406 --> 00:25:52,348
for the sake of arbitrary completion.

412
00:25:52,348 --> 00:25:57,351
The fact that of all the moments in Florence's day,

413
00:25:57,351 --> 00:25:59,232
we're featuring her brushing her teeth,

414
00:25:59,232 --> 00:26:04,196
say something about how exciting her life is at this point.

415
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:05,817
Many of the interactions in the game

416
00:26:05,817 --> 00:26:08,859
are simplifications of what we do in real life,

417
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:11,541
perhaps even the things that we do on mobile devices.

418
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:15,534
So the game is using the player's familiarity

419
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:18,076
with mobile interfaces to tell a story

420
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,178
while also creating a connection

421
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:22,160
between the player and Florence.

422
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,663
Other interactions in Florence are more abstract

423
00:26:25,663 --> 00:26:31,488
or are activities that are metaphors

424
00:26:31,488 --> 00:26:34,470
for what's going on emotionally with the characters.

425
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,914
One example of that is the chapter called Fragments.

426
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:44,129
The player has to tear up an image of Krish piece by piece.

427
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:48,793
But it's a metaphor for Florence losing Krish from her life.

428
00:26:48,793 --> 00:26:52,237
This is where the touch screen can be so powerful,

429
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:55,160
the player is actually having to tear Krish apart

430
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,181
with their bare hands.

431
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:59,584
In this chapter, we wanted to convey

432
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:04,009
that Florence is really nervous for her first date with Krish.

433
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,679
Forming a speech bubble out of puzzle pieces

434
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,721
requires just enough brain power and just enough time

435
00:27:10,721 --> 00:27:14,123
to make the player feel like it's taking effort for Florence

436
00:27:14,123 --> 00:27:16,344
to think of the right words to say to Krish.

437
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:19,085
The resulting speech bubble itself

438
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:21,206
is a colored shape with no words in it.

439
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:24,488
And this suggests to the player that what's important

440
00:27:24,488 --> 00:27:26,649
is not what was said, but what it took to say it.

441
00:27:26,649 --> 00:27:30,251
Krish, on the other hand, responds pretty quick,

442
00:27:30,251 --> 00:27:32,032
as if he's relaxed and confident.

443
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,272
As Florence and Krish go on more dates,

444
00:27:35,272 --> 00:27:37,174
the puzzles get easier,

445
00:27:37,174 --> 00:27:39,956
and the player applying the metaphor

446
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:41,497
understands that Florence is becoming

447
00:27:41,497 --> 00:27:43,019
more comfortable around this person,

448
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:44,700
and the words are flowing easier.

449
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,863
We found that revisiting mechanics

450
00:27:47,863 --> 00:27:50,946
was a great way to show that the characters

451
00:27:50,946 --> 00:27:54,509
or the relationship had undergone change.

452
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:58,152
Here we see a different take on the speech bubble mechanic

453
00:27:58,152 --> 00:28:00,634
when Florence and Krish are having their first big argument.

454
00:28:01,608 --> 00:28:03,910
We're still creating speech bubbles out of pieces,

455
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,251
but the shape of the pieces and the way the characters

456
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:09,592
talk over each other produce a very different feeling.

457
00:28:09,592 --> 00:28:12,633
The final two chapters of the game

458
00:28:12,633 --> 00:28:14,354
are sort of a best of compilation

459
00:28:14,354 --> 00:28:17,696
of all the mechanics from the rest of the game.

460
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,276
It's as if Florence and the player

461
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:22,118
are using everything that they learned along the way

462
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:24,859
in order to complete this phase of Florence's life.

463
00:28:24,859 --> 00:28:28,801
Finally, I'd like to talk about some of the takeaways

464
00:28:28,801 --> 00:28:30,402
I have from working on this project.

465
00:28:32,257 --> 00:28:34,478
I'm very proud of what Our Little Game accomplished.

466
00:28:34,478 --> 00:28:40,163
The success of Florence was enough for Mountains to secure new projects, so Our Little Studio

467
00:28:40,163 --> 00:28:44,406
will continue to exist and to grow, and for that I'm really, really grateful.

468
00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:49,450
But despite all of the awards that it's won and all the wonderful reviews and word of

469
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,733
mouth, thank you all, Florence only did sort of okay.

470
00:28:54,701 --> 00:28:57,482
It made its money back, and then some.

471
00:28:57,482 --> 00:28:59,423
We could afford to raise our salaries a little

472
00:28:59,423 --> 00:29:02,124
and do a little sponsorship, but we're not at the point yet

473
00:29:02,124 --> 00:29:06,486
where we can completely fund our next project by ourselves.

474
00:29:06,486 --> 00:29:08,847
It makes me wonder how premium games fare

475
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,168
when they don't win Apple Design Awards

476
00:29:10,168 --> 00:29:13,249
or when they don't get constant featuring on the App Store.

477
00:29:13,249 --> 00:29:16,330
I think if your business plan is based around

478
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:18,651
premium mobile, you're up for a really tough challenge.

479
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:21,372
I don't know if that's any more challenging

480
00:29:21,372 --> 00:29:23,693
than standing out in the free-to-play crowd.

481
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:27,381
Some industry commentators would say that Game Pass style

482
00:29:27,381 --> 00:29:30,063
subscriptions will be the next big thing.

483
00:29:30,063 --> 00:29:34,247
But we'll have to wait and see who that benefits.

484
00:29:34,247 --> 00:29:36,429
A couple of stats.

485
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:38,711
iOS makes up 88% of sales and Android 12%.

486
00:29:38,711 --> 00:29:42,574
But know that Florence is not yet out on Android in China.

487
00:29:43,628 --> 00:29:47,929
Speaking of China, China is our biggest market on iOS by far,

488
00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:48,309
over 40%.

489
00:29:48,309 --> 00:29:51,670
That's almost double the next biggest country by sales,

490
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,050
which is the US.

491
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:56,031
So China is a massive and important market.

492
00:29:56,031 --> 00:30:02,633
Just a couple of anecdotal player patterns very briefly.

493
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:06,493
We didn't expect that couples would play this game together,

494
00:30:06,493 --> 00:30:09,254
but we saw that happen with our demo,

495
00:30:09,254 --> 00:30:12,635
and then saw that continue on with the full experience.

496
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,202
We heard of people that played Florence just after a breakup,

497
00:30:17,202 --> 00:30:19,083
and that sounds really painful to me,

498
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:24,226
but we heard that it helps the healing process.

499
00:30:24,226 --> 00:30:27,748
Some parents told us that their kids played Florence,

500
00:30:27,748 --> 00:30:29,289
which is not something that I expected.

501
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:30,550
Like, I thought that it would be

502
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,051
a nostalgic look back on dating,

503
00:30:32,051 --> 00:30:35,353
and I didn't really anticipate the effect of people,

504
00:30:35,353 --> 00:30:36,474
you know, playing Florence

505
00:30:36,474 --> 00:30:39,636
before they had started having relationships.

506
00:30:41,091 --> 00:30:43,612
Many people told us that they played Florence on the plane

507
00:30:43,612 --> 00:30:46,133
or in public transport, and they usually shared this

508
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:49,335
because the game made them cry.

509
00:30:49,335 --> 00:30:52,436
And I couldn't help but notice that a lot of these stories

510
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:53,696
about crying came from men.

511
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:57,698
And I think maybe this would surprise some people

512
00:30:57,698 --> 00:31:00,579
because they'd think that Florence was sort of a game

513
00:31:00,579 --> 00:31:03,600
more targeted towards women, but I think this signifies

514
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,502
that men are actually more than open to having

515
00:31:07,502 --> 00:31:09,803
emotional experiences in games and sharing that.

516
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,461
Oh yeah, men cry too.

517
00:31:13,461 --> 00:31:16,964
Almost out of time, this is not Florence.

518
00:31:16,964 --> 00:31:20,047
This is A Gay's Life, a free web game

519
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:23,030
made by Huang Gao Le, a 27-year-old developer

520
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,470
from China.

521
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:27,073
A Gay's Life borrows heavily from Florence's art style

522
00:31:27,073 --> 00:31:29,776
and mechanics, but it tells its own story,

523
00:31:29,776 --> 00:31:32,518
that of a man discovering his sexuality

524
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:35,821
against the backdrop of Chinese family and social dynamics

525
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:37,562
based on Huang's own experiences.

526
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:40,931
Unlike Florence, it introduces the element of choice

527
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:42,273
and makes heavy use of text.

528
00:31:42,273 --> 00:31:46,257
It's only available in Chinese and has been played

529
00:31:46,257 --> 00:31:47,658
more than 1.6 million times.

530
00:31:47,658 --> 00:31:51,582
This is the greatest impact that I could have hoped for,

531
00:31:51,582 --> 00:31:55,305
for someone with less privilege and resources than us

532
00:31:55,305 --> 00:31:57,167
to be able to benefit from our work

533
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:58,448
and use it to tell their own story.

534
00:32:00,443 --> 00:32:04,085
I don't feel particularly possessive over any of the techniques or insights that I've

535
00:32:04,085 --> 00:32:05,466
discussed today.

536
00:32:05,466 --> 00:32:09,207
So if there's anything in Florence that you feel is useful for you and your work, please

537
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:11,388
feel free to borrow, adapt, or steal.

538
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:15,850
Right now, games could use a wider variety of stories from a wider range of creators,

539
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:19,391
and we couldn't be happier if Florence helps people achieve that.

540
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:20,892
Thank you very much.
