1
00:00:03,201 --> 00:00:03,342
so

2
00:00:13,254 --> 00:00:13,914
My name is Dino.

3
00:00:14,895 --> 00:00:21,639
I've been working with tech for 23 years.

4
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:26,162
I've been working professionally with games for 20 years.

5
00:00:27,283 --> 00:00:33,987
I'm mostly known for co-founding and running Playdead for around 10 years.

6
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:46,097
Since then, I've done a company called Jump Ship that did a game called Somerville, and I'm also running a company called Coherence.

7
00:00:47,878 --> 00:01:02,605
And my goal for today is that if anybody of you kind of thinking about starting a company, like to inspire you to take the jump, and if you already did it, I hope to help you with some thoughts and some of the mindsets doing it.

8
00:01:06,008 --> 00:01:20,921
And it's also important for me to note that this, whoops, this of course is my perspective and a lot of this is my thought processes derived from the values I have and my experiences leading me to my goals.

9
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:22,663
So take it with a grain of salt.

10
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:30,690
But all of these are things when I made the talk that I thought it would be nice to know when I was starting out.

11
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:47,166
So it's a talk that lasts half an hour and it's hard to go in depth, but I thought about five fundamentals I find very, very important for when you want to start your company.

12
00:01:48,627 --> 00:01:59,254
It's vision, risk, valuation, which maybe becomes a bit technical, team, and then I'll end up talking about you.

13
00:02:03,046 --> 00:02:07,067
These are vision basics, and this is very simple.

14
00:02:07,107 --> 00:02:19,210
This is also something you can kind of look up, but a vision is there for you to kind of picture yourself a clear, compelling future.

15
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,531
It's for you to motivate yourself, and it's for you to motivate a team.

16
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:36,331
It's something that helps you along the way to keep your eyes on the longer term goals because it's so easy to be bogged down in the short term.

17
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:47,359
It's something that can both attract investors, partners, employees, but it's also something you can use to select the right partners, investors, employees.

18
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:55,593
It's something you can use whenever you think about how you want to build your company culture.

19
00:02:56,233 --> 00:03:03,338
And lastly, it's something that you can use to differentiate yourself in the very early stage.

20
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:11,565
And I want to start out with my story and some of it that relates to vision.

21
00:03:13,122 --> 00:03:19,265
So I started as an employee in the tech industry when I started out, and I shifted to games in around 2003.

22
00:03:21,386 --> 00:03:27,109
In 2005, I quit my job because I thought the game industry was shit.

23
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,351
It was hard, I started consulting.

24
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:36,354
But I remember when I started as a consultant,

25
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,299
I had this urge of creating a product.

26
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:43,460
I remember that if you just sell your own time, you're just limited.

27
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:44,921
You're limited by your own time.

28
00:03:46,321 --> 00:03:56,024
So already at that point, I had the thought that I wanted to find some kind of product, something that I could make and it could be replicated.

29
00:03:58,765 --> 00:03:59,966
So this was the start of things.

30
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:09,233
And in the end of 2005, I made Ant, as some of you know, and we created Playdead.

31
00:04:10,514 --> 00:04:14,637
And I remember my main motivation here was that I kind of felt I found my product.

32
00:04:14,677 --> 00:04:21,521
I felt that we could build a vision that was like worth it for me to kind of jump into this.

33
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:31,786
And for me, it was kind of the big driver's license in trying to find out what it is to have a vision.

34
00:04:32,787 --> 00:04:42,511
Because it was kind of 10 years just with a deep focus on the vision, which was deep artistic independence and creative freedom.

35
00:04:45,171 --> 00:04:47,192
I learned how powerful it was to communicate.

36
00:04:47,652 --> 00:04:50,814
I learned how it was to communicate to partners.

37
00:04:51,194 --> 00:04:53,556
I learned how it was to fight for.

38
00:04:58,218 --> 00:05:06,943
And, you know, we were sticking stubbornly to this and it was kind of fun because it's learning about how powerful a vision is.

39
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:08,644
I think, you know, I can tell it to you now,

40
00:05:10,046 --> 00:05:21,498
For 10 years in a row, fighting and trying to do something again and again, getting a feedback and a positive feedback loop, which sometimes, you know, it takes a year to get a positive feedback loop.

41
00:05:21,518 --> 00:05:26,323
You have an idea, and then after a year, you see, okay, now we have five employees that fit into that vision.

42
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:27,464
Okay, it actually feels good.

43
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:31,008
You say no to something.

44
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:38,555
And it feels good because you find out a long time after it was a good choice because that helped you stick to the vision.

45
00:05:40,657 --> 00:05:51,686
Even at one point in the history of play that we had some investors and they wanted to sell the company and they wanted to sell it to Ubisoft.

46
00:05:53,388 --> 00:05:57,512
And I remember it was such a hard choice for us to

47
00:05:58,974 --> 00:06:06,999
say no to that, but it just felt that not saying no to that would completely ruin that vision in so many ways.

48
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:15,984
I also learned that even if you're just making a game, you can still touch the hearts of people around the globe.

49
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:17,959
Yeah.

50
00:06:20,122 --> 00:06:27,852
So when I started Jumpship, my goal was to kind of continue that with a focus on independence and creative freedom.

51
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:30,255
This time it was just around Chris Olsen's vision.

52
00:06:32,137 --> 00:06:33,479
And again, the example is here that

53
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,262
We only choose partners that could help us keep the creative vision.

54
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:48,626
We had NetEase as investors, and they were chosen because they were the ones that said that they invested in us for our vision and not to change anything.

55
00:06:49,447 --> 00:06:54,489
And it was also, we recently sold the company to Thunderful, and it was again the same.

56
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,594
This company that bought us was fully aligned with what we wanted to do with the company, that we could do it.

57
00:07:06,216 --> 00:07:08,438
With Coherence, it was a lot of things coming together.

58
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:12,120
Coherence is a network technology.

59
00:07:14,122 --> 00:07:17,925
But it started out with a lot of talks about, where are games going?

60
00:07:19,766 --> 00:07:25,211
And I also at that time thought a lot about multiplayer games and I thought about, should I do a multiplayer game?

61
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:31,896
I'm really fascinated about, you know, how is it to create a story in a multiplayer environment?

62
00:07:33,457 --> 00:07:35,159
But again, it all clicked for us.

63
00:07:37,216 --> 00:07:44,486
the feeling of making a technology where we could enable other people to be creative and iterate.

64
00:07:44,927 --> 00:07:48,411
And suddenly we came up with that idea that felt big enough.

65
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:51,976
So yeah.

66
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:57,470
So what I learned was you can cultivate a vision.

67
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,572
I don't think that when you are young that you maybe are born with having a vision.

68
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:08,654
I think for me it was something I learned, something that I learned by the positive food feedback loop.

69
00:08:08,674 --> 00:08:14,135
Yeah, the positive reinforcement.

70
00:08:16,256 --> 00:08:17,937
It's important to learn how to communicate it.

71
00:08:19,016 --> 00:08:25,260
I've never been really, really good at writing down like any vision I had.

72
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:32,784
But I think in any steps of my life, when I did something with my companies, I always been really, really good at communicating it.

73
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:36,186
And you know, if you ask me about it, I can talk day in and day out about it.

74
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:46,621
And I also learned that the better you become in communicating what your vision is, actually the easier everything becomes.

75
00:08:47,822 --> 00:08:55,744
People understanding your vision, people understanding what you're doing, just removes barriers.

76
00:08:59,255 --> 00:09:04,677
Also, if there's holes in your vision, you kind of figure that out early on as you start talking about it.

77
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:15,500
And I think it's so important to clear out, like, when you start a vision, that's the cheapest point for you to kind of find out if this is a good way to go.

78
00:09:19,821 --> 00:09:23,122
I also found out that having a big vision is better than a small vision.

79
00:09:23,722 --> 00:09:30,064
And it maybe seems self-explanatory, but how are you going to motivate yourself with a small vision?

80
00:09:30,204 --> 00:09:34,405
How are you going to motivate your employees with something bland?

81
00:09:35,485 --> 00:09:37,786
It's kind of, for me, defeats the purpose of having a vision at all.

82
00:09:37,906 --> 00:09:40,727
So it's, yeah, it's better to have a big one.

83
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:48,389
The other thing I learned also is that to continue to use your vision, like you can have it and you can think about it, but then when you start working,

84
00:09:53,814 --> 00:10:03,585
Kind of the vision gets tainted because when you start out you have a really pure and clear idea always and there's no problems in that idea.

85
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:06,989
There's always perfect and then

86
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:12,170
When you go into it, there's a day-to-day thing, there's problems, there's things that doesn't work out.

87
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:22,887
And if you don't always go back and think about what was the original intent with this, you often get lost in the day-to-day.

88
00:10:25,947 --> 00:10:37,492
And something I do myself, and this is like kind of an exercise, is like when I go around my own time, I run, I do something like when I'm not officially at work, I kind of just always take on the original vision.

89
00:10:37,532 --> 00:10:39,853
I try to go in and visualize how was it?

90
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:41,854
What was the original feeling I wanted to have of this?

91
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,755
Is it still what we have in the company?

92
00:10:45,115 --> 00:10:45,735
Sometimes it's not.

93
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:50,877
Sometimes it is, you know, you need to go back and reevaluate.

94
00:10:52,538 --> 00:10:54,861
That's why it's important to kind of always use it.

95
00:10:56,063 --> 00:11:00,107
And you should use it when you prioritize and when you decide your focus.

96
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:06,295
Is your prioritization aligned with what the vision was?

97
00:11:07,697 --> 00:11:09,038
And also when you're hiring and partnering.

98
00:11:09,838 --> 00:11:16,545
Will the person sitting in front of you that you consider higher, will that person help you complete this vision?

99
00:11:17,425 --> 00:11:21,469
Will this partner help make this vision?

100
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:22,691
It's really important.

101
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:31,499
And then I think emotion is like, you can almost not have a vision without invoking emotion.

102
00:11:35,154 --> 00:11:43,622
If vision don't have a component that makes you either excited or happy or gives you some kind of feeling, I think it's hard.

103
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:47,586
And again, I think as long as you work with humans, it is this key element.

104
00:11:47,646 --> 00:11:53,352
If you don't have a vision that kind of sparks something in yourself or other people, it's useless.

105
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:02,294
And the last point is, I think you should never make money part of the vision or any goal, to be honest.

106
00:12:03,675 --> 00:12:07,117
It is such a flat and emotionless motivator.

107
00:12:07,957 --> 00:12:10,119
And what would happen if you got enough?

108
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:10,899
Would you then stop?

109
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,922
I mean, I tried to both have little money and a lot of money.

110
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:19,284
And in the end, it doesn't make a difference.

111
00:12:20,164 --> 00:12:22,766
Especially not if you want to achieve something big.

112
00:12:25,463 --> 00:12:28,125
And I have these exercises I use myself a lot.

113
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:33,809
And the first one is just like, trying to vividly imagining your vision.

114
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:44,356
Like, when you sit and you are thinking about starting a company or have started a company, try thinking about what is the end goal?

115
00:12:44,496 --> 00:12:45,157
What does it give you?

116
00:12:48,277 --> 00:12:50,319
What is the feeling in your body if you achieve this?

117
00:12:51,120 --> 00:13:03,434
Taking yourself forward to the future and experiencing the feeling you would get hitting your goal I think is a kind of a cheat code because you kind of already get a bit of that

118
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:11,953
like feeling, and I do that often enough, and you will compel yourself to go toward that goal.

119
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:14,515
And what is the story?

120
00:13:14,535 --> 00:13:17,517
What is the story from the point where you are now to that end goal?

121
00:13:18,177 --> 00:13:18,877
Is it a good story?

122
00:13:20,058 --> 00:13:22,540
And again, what emotion is it invoking in you?

123
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:25,582
Try explaining it to others.

124
00:13:26,663 --> 00:13:30,005
It's actually, when you explain it to others, you often can hear your own bullshit.

125
00:13:33,024 --> 00:13:35,187
And I just think it's very powerful.

126
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:38,451
The vision has to get out of one point, right?

127
00:13:38,912 --> 00:13:42,796
If you need other people to help you lift it, you need to start talking about it.

128
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:51,768
And you kind of need to look at how do they look when you talk about it.

129
00:13:53,208 --> 00:14:04,214
I mean, yeah, here in America, like people are so nice and you tell them what you're doing and everybody says, oh, it sounds good, you know, you can tell anything and everybody here says, but you need to look at how, like, are they smiling?

130
00:14:04,334 --> 00:14:06,075
Are they really taking it in or are they just being polite?

131
00:14:07,056 --> 00:14:17,262
The other thing is also if you do it and you kind of want people on the vision, like, does your vision, would it include more people than you?

132
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:20,744
Like, is it an egoistic vision or would it include other people?

133
00:14:22,483 --> 00:14:23,984
Is your vision worth fighting for?

134
00:14:24,325 --> 00:14:28,829
Because this is never going to be an easy thing.

135
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:34,454
Like, I mean, it's always a fight to come from nothing, to create something of nothing.

136
00:14:37,316 --> 00:14:39,038
It don't take zero effort.

137
00:14:39,158 --> 00:14:43,021
There's always a lot of fighting because you also want other people fighting for it.

138
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:46,204
And you probably also want other people putting money in it.

139
00:14:46,564 --> 00:14:48,646
And if the vision is not strong enough to hold that,

140
00:14:51,444 --> 00:14:52,385
Yeah, it's pretty hard.

141
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,669
And again, the last thing is, are you working on the right vision?

142
00:15:00,612 --> 00:15:07,918
As I said, like in the start, where you have the vision, this is the easiest time to kind of decide if this is worth working on.

143
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:13,623
And working on the, like, yeah.

144
00:15:16,257 --> 00:15:20,746
It's easier to become successful working on the right vision than putting effort into the wrong vision.

145
00:15:26,184 --> 00:15:31,989
A great vision is the fuel that propels us forward, challenging us to push beyond our limits and reach new heights.

146
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:34,891
With that comes risk and the possibility of failure.

147
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:35,731
You have to take risk.

148
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:37,233
In the game industry, you have to take risk.

149
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:38,173
I'm pretty sure.

150
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:48,141
I think not taking risk and doing something common is kind of the most risky path here.

151
00:15:49,522 --> 00:15:50,503
There's so many games.

152
00:15:50,803 --> 00:15:52,204
There's so many standard games.

153
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:54,026
Every game has been made, right?

154
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:57,208
The only way to make it a game that hasn't been made before is to take risks.

155
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:06,476
So with risk, the only thing there is with risk is you need to manage it and find the balance.

156
00:16:08,831 --> 00:16:23,025
And the fun thing with Risk is that it's visible from the outside, and when you look at any game production, it usually looks like this, that you find the finished game on Steam, and you think that the people who made it, they just had an idea about this game, and they made it.

157
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:25,787
And this is normal.

158
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:29,511
And the fun thing with Risk is actually that Risk is kind of like pain.

159
00:16:29,651 --> 00:16:30,852
It's such a momentary thing.

160
00:16:31,393 --> 00:16:31,973
Even people...

161
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:43,587
working on any project can have a lot of risky situations and at any points have such a hard time with choices and prioritization.

162
00:16:44,007 --> 00:16:47,711
But when you often reach your goals, if they're set up correctly, all the risk is gone.

163
00:16:47,972 --> 00:16:50,074
There's nothing left, like everything.

164
00:16:50,374 --> 00:16:52,757
And when you think back about it, it's like, what was the risk?

165
00:16:52,797 --> 00:16:54,018
Like, of course we did these choices.

166
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,022
And this is usually how it is.

167
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:01,683
There's a starting point and you have a vision.

168
00:17:02,204 --> 00:17:04,005
And the vision is not a point usually, right?

169
00:17:04,085 --> 00:17:06,006
It's a feeling of a place you want to go.

170
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:10,890
And you start off with nothing and you iterate.

171
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:41,534
and you try to go towards your vision and it doesn't work and you go a bit like another direction and you know slowly you get close to the vision but of course you never hit it because the vision is big right the vision has everything the vision is always perfect and has like all of these ideas but the game is a thing right there's a you have a controller maybe or something that there's choices that needs to be made needs to be a specific thing

172
00:17:44,055 --> 00:17:46,857
And it's all about managing the risk in this.

173
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:57,064
As a side note, if you are inexperienced, you usually only look for the budget to take you the direct path.

174
00:17:59,585 --> 00:18:03,307
And that's why you end up crunching because you actually need to do this.

175
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:10,452
Then there's valuation.

176
00:18:12,907 --> 00:18:14,028
Just bear with me for a moment here.

177
00:18:15,569 --> 00:18:19,433
This is maybe a bit technical, but of course I don't really know the concept of valuation.

178
00:18:19,493 --> 00:18:21,195
It's the value of the company.

179
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:25,039
And when you start up the company, it's the value of you because you are the company and you're the only person.

180
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,021
And this consists of...

181
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:28,919
Time and money.

182
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:31,220
It's your team and team history.

183
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,420
A lot about the founders, but it's always the whole team.

184
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,321
It's what you have produced, the IP rights and game product.

185
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:45,222
It's technology, blah, blah, blah.

186
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,262
It's also external validation.

187
00:18:49,163 --> 00:18:55,684
If you have, already have customers, if you have early access, if you have a community, that's also value.

188
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:00,076
You should have backers.

189
00:19:00,977 --> 00:19:04,178
And then there's the soft elements that actually also can affect your valuation.

190
00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:09,461
The reputation and the culture.

191
00:19:11,121 --> 00:19:13,162
And why am I talking about such a technical thing?

192
00:19:13,882 --> 00:19:18,324
The thing is, when you start out the first time, you have nothing.

193
00:19:18,764 --> 00:19:21,806
And the whole, what's it called?

194
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:33,172
Your job is to make as much value as possible before you let external money in.

195
00:19:35,373 --> 00:19:37,833
And it usually looks like this.

196
00:19:40,074 --> 00:19:44,195
The left part is maybe your own value.

197
00:19:44,635 --> 00:19:48,716
That is the time you put in, and the right side is the external money.

198
00:19:49,296 --> 00:19:50,837
And what happens when you

199
00:19:52,921 --> 00:20:14,334
Understand how that is all about putting in as much value as possible you kind of get to a place where you get more and more power and in the end like I'm trying to say is that When you start your first company you often get offered shit deals and this is this is why So it's always like the more time you can use the more

200
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:21,713
You can put into this, before you take external money, the more control you end up having in the end.

201
00:20:23,356 --> 00:20:25,721
I call it valuation steps.

202
00:20:28,797 --> 00:20:33,500
And in Playdead, we started from scratch, and it was, of course, really, really hard.

203
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,042
We started with not so many things.

204
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:44,388
And that was also the reason why we had, we lost control along the way, and we actually also ended up with less than 50%.

205
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:54,656
But what changed since then was that I came out of that building new things, but I came, both the experience, and I came with my own money.

206
00:20:55,762 --> 00:21:03,248
And for example, in Jump Ship, I used my own money until we came to a vertical slice, and that just made everything much easier.

207
00:21:08,932 --> 00:21:09,913
Then I have a point about the team.

208
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:16,618
There's a lot to say about this topic, and I'm already almost running out of time, I can see.

209
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:24,244
You need a team to leverage your own time.

210
00:21:25,307 --> 00:21:29,388
So unless you're a one-man band and you do your own game, which I would not recommend.

211
00:21:30,068 --> 00:21:35,810
I know a lot of people have done it, and it's seemingly more hard than if you have a team.

212
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,291
So you need a team to leverage something bigger.

213
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:44,732
And you need a team to work for you, because it's critical if you want to build something that's bigger than you.

214
00:21:47,193 --> 00:21:48,813
Vision in a vacuum is nothing.

215
00:21:49,794 --> 00:21:51,414
Without execution, ideas are worthless.

216
00:21:56,175 --> 00:21:58,737
You always want to hire people that are better than you.

217
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:08,947
And I'm not talking about juniors and interns, because I see them as an investment you do in your company, and you can do that later on the line when you want to scale more.

218
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,090
But in the start, you only want to have people that are better than you.

219
00:22:14,512 --> 00:22:15,733
You want self-motivated people.

220
00:22:16,494 --> 00:22:18,996
Again, in the beginning, this is gold.

221
00:22:22,247 --> 00:22:25,669
The only way you can leverage your own time is if you find this.

222
00:22:28,691 --> 00:22:31,492
The team skills are defining what you can create.

223
00:22:32,993 --> 00:22:39,256
You either create what your team can make, or you have to hire people with skills that can create your vision.

224
00:22:41,237 --> 00:22:42,198
You cannot do it with anything else.

225
00:22:44,403 --> 00:22:45,524
And the last point is culture.

226
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:50,928
And again, this is a big and huge topic.

227
00:22:52,149 --> 00:22:57,393
But in all the companies I've started, this has been one of the key things.

228
00:23:00,795 --> 00:23:06,300
You and the first people in the company are going to define how this is shaping up.

229
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:09,202
And culture always trickles down.

230
00:23:12,154 --> 00:23:19,018
And there's a lot of soft factors going into this, but I think in the end it just comes down to your values and your behavior.

231
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:28,884
And I know this is not the most important thing, but I also think that it's important to look at the work environment.

232
00:23:31,565 --> 00:23:34,487
Because is this where you want to have your grand ideas?

233
00:23:34,687 --> 00:23:35,988
Is this where you want to be creative?

234
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:45,595
Or is it like this where you play board games and you kind of have a more loose environment?

235
00:23:46,196 --> 00:23:53,241
And I think it's maybe a smaller thing of culture, but I still feel like the place you spend most of your time

236
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:55,373
It's really important as a coach.

237
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:56,954
It's really important that it's a place you want to be.

238
00:23:57,314 --> 00:24:06,159
It's really important it's a place where all of your employees want to come, where they have a good time.

239
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:19,347
And that's also why I always, again, whenever I started, have made a big deal out of making everybody feel really good and take good care of my employees.

240
00:24:21,508 --> 00:24:22,249
And the last thing is you.

241
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:28,632
You will always start inexperienced.

242
00:24:30,454 --> 00:24:30,954
That's how it is.

243
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:40,482
And most people start as, you know, a graphic designer, a game designer, a coder, sometimes also from business.

244
00:24:43,804 --> 00:24:44,385
And that's how it is.

245
00:24:44,545 --> 00:24:45,305
And you just need to learn.

246
00:24:45,466 --> 00:24:47,267
You need to learn immensely fast.

247
00:24:48,328 --> 00:24:51,110
And it's important that you like to learn.

248
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,232
And you learn to like to learn.

249
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:55,294
You need to learn leadership skills.

250
00:24:55,354 --> 00:24:56,575
You need to learn to prioritize.

251
00:24:56,615 --> 00:24:58,256
You need to learn to communicate your vision.

252
00:24:58,837 --> 00:25:00,318
You need to learn to leverage your skills.

253
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:01,779
You need to learn to negotiate.

254
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:03,961
You need to learn to hire.

255
00:25:05,141 --> 00:25:07,543
This becomes such a key skill of doing this.

256
00:25:07,803 --> 00:25:09,665
And you need to really learn to love it.

257
00:25:12,087 --> 00:25:15,990
Because there's like, there will be a lot of stress and pressure.

258
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:21,894
And if you don't learn to kind of navigate it and really kind of also,

259
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:28,273
in some sick way, enjoy it, it just becomes really, really tough.

260
00:25:31,174 --> 00:25:36,215
I also think you have to be critical of yourself and be able to take critique.

261
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,256
It's so easy to fool yourself.

262
00:25:39,256 --> 00:25:40,296
It's super, super tough.

263
00:25:40,556 --> 00:25:45,118
I've taken a lot of critique and I'm also really, really critical of myself.

264
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:48,343
And it's not easy to be honest to yourself.

265
00:25:48,663 --> 00:25:52,224
It's easier to hear what you want to hear.

266
00:25:53,564 --> 00:25:56,985
But I think it's really important for you to grow and actually to be able to learn.

267
00:25:57,005 --> 00:26:03,826
I also think in the end, nobody cares about your goals.

268
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:10,668
If you're good at the vision, you make people care about the vision.

269
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:16,159
But actually I think being an entrepreneur is kind of also a very lonely position.

270
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,505
You're often alone with your thoughts.

271
00:26:23,528 --> 00:26:25,890
You cannot expect anyone to be sorry for you.

272
00:26:26,994 --> 00:26:29,956
All of the risk you have is by choice.

273
00:26:30,776 --> 00:26:35,079
So you cannot go and cry to anybody because this is something you choose.

274
00:26:35,379 --> 00:26:36,320
You can also not do it.

275
00:26:39,762 --> 00:26:43,745
And you're always trying somewhat to do something that's personal for you.

276
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:48,669
And again, looping a bit back to vision.

277
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,931
That's why I think it's important to have that.

278
00:26:50,951 --> 00:26:55,095
You need to have that feeling of where you're ending up.

279
00:26:55,635 --> 00:27:00,040
And also, you have to have that feeling of it being bigger than yourself and it including people.

280
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,622
Because if it includes people, they will care a bit more about you.

281
00:27:06,824 --> 00:27:07,625
You need to level up.

282
00:27:09,166 --> 00:27:12,148
Going through different projects and companies, you need to level up.

283
00:27:12,729 --> 00:27:14,030
This is the only thing you bring with you.

284
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:22,937
And in my own example, it was kind of shit scary to start up a new company after Playdead.

285
00:27:22,957 --> 00:27:24,458
You build up a lot of things around you.

286
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:26,140
You have everything handled.

287
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,641
There's a system for everything.

288
00:27:27,861 --> 00:27:29,322
And suddenly you start from square one.

289
00:27:30,263 --> 00:27:33,588
And you just have to rely on your experience and you have to learn again.

290
00:27:34,188 --> 00:27:37,733
You have to learn new people to know It was even scarier to start coherence.

291
00:27:38,274 --> 00:27:38,855
It was a new

292
00:27:40,666 --> 00:27:45,069
it was in tech and suddenly actually nobody even know who I was, to be honest.

293
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,273
Whoever we raised money for never heard about Limbo Insight.

294
00:27:49,573 --> 00:27:50,334
They didn't care about it.

295
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:59,941
So I kind of just had to rely on like raw experience of how to raise money and how to drive a company and all of that.

296
00:28:02,423 --> 00:28:08,668
But of course, because I feel I leveled up in all of this, I bought myself, I bought my experience, obviously also brought some money, helps.

297
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:18,439
I actually think I maybe need to skip this because I'm very much over time.

298
00:28:22,002 --> 00:28:24,664
Just in short, I just want to say that there is an age for everything.

299
00:28:25,685 --> 00:28:35,694
And I think you need to do your biggest risk as you are in your 25 to 35.

300
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,450
When you're above that, you can take risk.

301
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:41,591
I still take risk, but I only take calculated risk.

302
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:51,574
And again, the example for me is that when I started Playdead, I bet everything I had at that point.

303
00:28:52,234 --> 00:28:55,475
Luckily, there wasn't a lot, so it didn't matter if we failed.

304
00:28:57,973 --> 00:29:07,222
So, I mean, but now, you know, I can only afford to take calculated risk, but I take a lot of risk, but it's always calculated because, I mean, now it's different, right?

305
00:29:10,686 --> 00:29:11,107
Pitfalls.

306
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:17,624
Avoid trends and the idea of quick rent That's in the game industry.

307
00:29:17,644 --> 00:29:21,868
There's so many fucking trends and it's so annoying, right?

308
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:23,730
It's AI now, right?

309
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,991
It was NFTs last year.

310
00:29:25,512 --> 00:29:26,933
Then it was a bit of VR, right?

311
00:29:27,894 --> 00:29:30,997
And it's like I I just think

312
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:35,798
you need to have a vision of something that stands the test of time.

313
00:29:36,218 --> 00:29:45,400
And again, now, as I said, like I've been doing this for 20 years, I've seen so many trends come and go, and you need to find something that just, and that's why we work on multiplayer tech, because multiplayer will always be there.

314
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:53,682
We can maybe, you know, do some major shit, I don't know, but I mean, in the end, I don't want to rely on these short-term trends.

315
00:29:54,522 --> 00:30:00,028
There are a lot of big tech companies trying to convince you to make these things, and they sometimes also pay you money.

316
00:30:00,949 --> 00:30:02,250
You get money to do your VR game.

317
00:30:03,712 --> 00:30:10,939
But when you're taking money, you are trading off short-term gain for your long-term goals.

318
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,480
And it's fine, but you actually don't have a limited time.

319
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:16,201
You can only do this a couple of times.

320
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:20,521
If you do this a couple of times, you never end up reaching your goal because, you know, time's up.

321
00:30:21,042 --> 00:30:23,602
So think about it when you take those dirty money.

322
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:31,143
Yeah, talent, that's not good for culture.

323
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:37,624
I have many times met a lot of really, really talented people that were not good for culture.

324
00:30:37,944 --> 00:30:40,425
And I would never, I don't think you should ever trade off

325
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:47,135
sacrificing culture for somebody that's really talented.

326
00:30:47,315 --> 00:30:48,535
It's not worth it in the end.

327
00:30:49,876 --> 00:30:51,336
It's better to have a good culture in a company.

328
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:52,917
It will serve you better in the long run.

329
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,338
And there's loss of focus.

330
00:30:57,916 --> 00:30:58,597
Nobody again.

331
00:30:58,737 --> 00:30:59,958
Nobody cares about your focus.

332
00:30:59,998 --> 00:31:13,229
Nobody cares about your time you get so much inbound and I think the more success you have the more inbound you get I get so many mails and Like a big learning I've made is just saying no saying no to fucking everything it's it's

333
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:21,245
It feels hard in the beginning, and you also sometimes feel rude, but I mean, in the end, it just becomes such an important skill.

334
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:27,291
You cannot read all mails, you cannot be looking into every technology that we offer for you.

335
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:33,717
I actually very, very rarely got inbound that was worth a yes.

336
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:37,661
Very few times, but most of the times, it's me researching the market.

337
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:42,551
understanding what's happening around me, finding some things and then me going for things I want.

338
00:31:44,251 --> 00:31:49,874
I just think that it's so easy to lose focus in the company and not do what you're supposed to do.

339
00:31:52,515 --> 00:31:53,255
This is my last slide.

340
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:56,697
This is the conclusion.

341
00:31:57,097 --> 00:31:58,338
Nobody will remember your small vision.

342
00:31:59,458 --> 00:31:59,998
Always go big.

343
00:32:01,179 --> 00:32:03,280
It's easier to go big sometimes.

344
00:32:04,281 --> 00:32:07,382
You can only hire level 10 talent for a level 10 idea.

345
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:08,763
That's how it is.

346
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:09,864
So why not?

347
00:32:11,865 --> 00:32:13,966
There's almost no downsides to have a big vision.

348
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:20,769
The only thing is, as I talked about with evaluation steps, there's a maximum for how big the vision can be compared to where you are.

349
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:27,172
Your first game or project will be the hardest birth.

350
00:32:28,192 --> 00:32:28,472
And I...

351
00:32:29,878 --> 00:32:36,824
I only tried my own first berth once, of course, but I really feel like this is what levels you up the most.

352
00:32:36,964 --> 00:32:38,846
This is where you take the hardest hits.

353
00:32:40,988 --> 00:32:45,312
From that point on, it's not downhill, but it only gets better.

354
00:32:46,773 --> 00:32:49,395
If you need to, cut scope, not quality.

355
00:32:50,156 --> 00:32:51,097
And I learned this the hard way.

356
00:32:54,017 --> 00:32:55,817
Find like-minded people and share ideas.

357
00:32:57,318 --> 00:33:00,619
I think the way I learned the most was by doing this.

358
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,380
Finding mentors.

359
00:33:04,781 --> 00:33:16,866
I started going to GDC in 2010 and a lot of my friends or colleagues from here learned me a lot about how to drive a company and gave me a lot of answers of things I needed.

360
00:33:16,986 --> 00:33:21,668
And it's usually like-minded, other company owners that kind of give you what you need.

361
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:25,422
And you can also share your ideas.

362
00:33:27,524 --> 00:33:28,225
This is a fun thing.

363
00:33:30,087 --> 00:33:40,477
And actually, I came, I thought about it going over here because I mean, if you're kind and generous, this has opened so many doors for me.

364
00:33:40,597 --> 00:33:41,197
It's crazy.

365
00:33:41,658 --> 00:33:43,760
Like, you go around, you're a good person.

366
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,722
People want you to meet other good people.

367
00:33:46,022 --> 00:33:47,083
And I mean,

368
00:33:48,084 --> 00:34:01,734
if you think about like, yeah, it's just open more doors than I ever could pay for, that I get introduced, this person introduced me to this person randomly, because they just think, you know, you're nice, you're nice, like you need to like exchange ideas.

369
00:34:02,955 --> 00:34:07,919
And it really has, I think looking back at it has been one of the things that's been the most helpful.

370
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:12,582
Yeah, my last point is never stop learning.

371
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:29,744
When you go through any type of process to hit a goal, you quickly realize that

372
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:41,355
If you're not putting enjoyment in the process, your enjoyment will be really short because all of your goals are just these small bleeps in this timeline.

373
00:34:42,576 --> 00:34:49,922
And that's why I think it's equally important to put focus on the process and not just put focus on the goals.

374
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:56,503
because I hit my goals a couple of times and it is a really short joy.

375
00:34:57,123 --> 00:35:08,786
And some of the times I actually kind of, you know, if I didn't take care, like if I didn't think about what my next goal would be, I would kind of be a bit depressed about it.

376
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:16,268
So my point is just here, like I think the process of what you're making is equally as important.

377
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:18,409
So even though it's hard to start your company or it's,

378
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:26,364
Yeah, that is hard to do the negotiation, all these things.

379
00:35:27,545 --> 00:35:30,447
You kind of have to find a way to make the process enjoyable.

380
00:35:32,128 --> 00:35:35,210
Because the goal will not be what you think it is.

381
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:43,154
You hit it, you're happy for three months, you release that game, you're happy for three months, but after that, there's life.

382
00:35:44,255 --> 00:35:46,576
Even if that goal make you financially

383
00:35:50,175 --> 00:35:51,676
independent, it doesn't matter.

384
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:55,058
You still need to have a path forward.

385
00:35:57,499 --> 00:35:58,600
Yeah, that's my talk.

386
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:10,067
So I went five minutes over.

387
00:36:10,807 --> 00:36:12,448
I could take questions if there's anything.

388
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:15,270
Yeah?

389
00:36:17,725 --> 00:36:18,265
Good afternoon.

390
00:36:19,205 --> 00:36:20,766
And no live stories as Elon Musk says.

391
00:36:21,326 --> 00:36:21,546
Okay.

392
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:28,588
So my question is, you said you've started one company and later had to start another.

393
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:34,830
And the only thing you carry with you is your own knowledge.

394
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:42,352
But I feel like the company I have, which does comics and animation, is adjacent to gaming.

395
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:58,077
Do you have any advice for how I could pot over the success in comics and animation into, let's say I'm trying to get funding or just someone interested in, hey, we already have these comics, would you partner with us to make the game?

396
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:04,604
Because we already have a certain level of success in comics and animation, but we've done absolutely nothing in gaming.

397
00:37:05,665 --> 00:37:08,248
I think every aspiring entrepreneur has a vision, right?

398
00:37:08,349 --> 00:37:09,650
And as you said, you need more than that.

399
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,051
You need a team.

400
00:37:22,037 --> 00:37:27,821
And it can be paralyzing trying to find a person to fit a specific role, especially if you don't know anything about it.

401
00:37:27,861 --> 00:37:31,943
Like if you're a programmer and you need an artist, how do I know if your portfolio is good?

402
00:37:32,363 --> 00:37:38,847
So as you've built these teams, do you have any advice on how to build a team out for areas that you have no familiarity with?

403
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:43,810
But I mean, don't you have a feeling of it?

404
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,072
Like, you know what looks good, right?

405
00:37:47,671 --> 00:37:52,294
You have an idea, but there are people who are really good at kind of BSing their way through things.

406
00:37:52,694 --> 00:37:59,338
And I think as the less experience you have, the more likely it is that you're going to be exploited by people who are good at doing that.

407
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:07,222
But as you probably also saw in my talk, I'm not good at graphics myself, but I feel I can see good graphics.

408
00:38:07,262 --> 00:38:08,843
I can see if there's emotion in it.

409
00:38:09,123 --> 00:38:12,786
I can see other people being talented in it, but I don't know if like, yeah.

410
00:38:14,468 --> 00:38:14,988
So it's a feeling.

411
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:16,229
Yeah, I think it's a feeling.

412
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:20,652
I mean, as I said, you need to do the negotiation.

413
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,613
You need to be able to turn them on.

414
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:28,397
But I think if you're the one at the rudder, you're choosing, I guess, what the graphics is.

415
00:38:29,398 --> 00:38:29,758
Makes sense.

416
00:38:29,818 --> 00:38:30,079
Thank you.

417
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:30,819
So follow your gut.

418
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:31,840
Yeah.

419
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,392
Do you do an advisory for startups?

420
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:40,753
Game startups?

421
00:38:40,993 --> 00:38:41,853
Yeah, I've done a bit.

422
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:42,453
Yeah?

423
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:42,853
Yeah.

424
00:38:43,314 --> 00:38:45,614
Well, I'd like to contact you about advising mine.

425
00:38:46,555 --> 00:38:47,115
You can mail me.

426
00:38:47,795 --> 00:38:48,055
Great.

427
00:38:48,295 --> 00:38:48,976
I'd probably say no.

428
00:38:49,656 --> 00:38:50,176
That's okay.

429
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:51,076
That's okay.

430
00:38:51,577 --> 00:38:52,317
Just read the email.

431
00:38:52,937 --> 00:38:53,677
Just read the email.

432
00:38:53,897 --> 00:38:54,178
Thank you.

433
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:54,998
Yeah, I will.

434
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:56,931
Thank you for your presentation.

435
00:38:57,091 --> 00:39:01,898
When you made your first transition from employee to business owner, how did you secure funding?

436
00:39:02,098 --> 00:39:03,600
Did you do because he had no experience?

437
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,741
So was it crowdfunding?

438
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:05,422
Was it grants?

439
00:39:05,462 --> 00:39:05,803
Was it VC?

440
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,405
Can you just share your experience?

441
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:10,277
But there's two elements to that.

442
00:39:10,497 --> 00:39:17,099
First of all, I could do the bet because I have saved up some of my own money, and I could work for a year without money.

443
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:20,240
And I had really low expenditures.

444
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:24,201
As I said, there was a point of my life where I spent almost nothing on where I lived.

445
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:32,824
So that's why it was kind of good for me to... It was high risk, but what I risked was low.

446
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:35,505
But we also got a grant.

447
00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:49,448
of $20,000, $30,000 I think it was at that point, which kind of helped hire the first person and get to a point where we could find funding.

448
00:39:51,108 --> 00:39:51,529
Thank you.

449
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:58,052
But I would like your expenditures, just keep them low.

450
00:39:58,572 --> 00:40:00,733
I think that's the best way to keep your risk low.

451
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:08,461
Okay, last question over here.

452
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,563
You mentioned culture a couple of times.

453
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:28,238
I was curious if you had anything more specific in terms of like any starter like culture for a new indie studio or like something that you experienced that you thought that worked well across your multiple companies.

454
00:40:29,656 --> 00:40:31,518
Yeah, but I think there's no right culture.

455
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:36,242
I mean, the culture I appreciate is what I've created.

456
00:40:38,584 --> 00:40:46,072
And I just think it's important that people that I work with have a good life and have a good time.

457
00:40:46,672 --> 00:40:52,338
And I have some old Playdate employees here, and I hope they can attest to that we always, I don't know how it is now.

458
00:40:53,178 --> 00:40:54,199
I hope it's gone to shit, no.

459
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,163
No, no, it's a joke.

460
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:58,224
Don't write that down.

461
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:02,650
No, but we always try to make it a good place to come.

462
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:09,739
It's always homey, we have sofas, we have lunch for people, we have fridges.

463
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:13,623
Like we didn't have that from the beginning, of course, but we had like an idea.

464
00:41:13,663 --> 00:41:16,324
We have a fridge with everything you could drink and want in life.

465
00:41:16,364 --> 00:41:20,867
And so we just want it to be a place where you can kind of, you were proud to bring your family.

466
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:23,289
But again, I don't think it's the, I don't know if that's the right way.

467
00:41:23,309 --> 00:41:24,550
That's just how I like to have it.

468
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,551
That's the workplace I need to want to come to.

469
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:33,736
I mean, I think it is, it's important just to create what you would like to come to because you also need to attract the people that have it like that.

470
00:41:34,256 --> 00:41:37,638
I mean, I would not attract a accountant maybe because they want something else.

471
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,990
Yeah, I hope that's enough to answer.

472
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:56,153
When you started Playdead, were you driven by a specific vision for a particular game, or was it a more studio-level vision of the kind of experiences, and which do you think is more important for someone starting their own?

473
00:41:56,533 --> 00:41:57,073
Yeah, I don't know.

474
00:41:57,513 --> 00:42:05,435
So, Ant, my partner, he had the vision for the game, and I would say I had the studio vision, but it had been, I would, yeah, we were,

475
00:42:06,804 --> 00:42:14,971
It's at one point we were so synergetic, it was hard, you know, we always, we met a couple of times a week and synchronized about like, you know, everything about the company.

476
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:21,257
So sometimes it was hard to find out who made the choice of what, but I mean, yeah, that was a split.

477
00:42:21,817 --> 00:42:22,117
Thank you.

478
00:42:23,398 --> 00:42:23,639
Cool.

479
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:24,820
Thanks a lot for coming.
