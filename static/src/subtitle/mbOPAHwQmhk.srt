1
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:07,595
VR lessons learned in a level design of Blood and Truth.

2
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,096
So as the title of the talk suggests,

3
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:12,276
we're going to be focusing entirely around VR.

4
00:00:12,956 --> 00:00:14,936
And starting off, I'm going to touch up on the topics

5
00:00:14,996 --> 00:00:17,517
of traversal and metrics, both of which

6
00:00:17,577 --> 00:00:19,437
are extremely important elements to VR,

7
00:00:19,517 --> 00:00:21,017
as together they create a foundation

8
00:00:21,037 --> 00:00:23,358
of comfortable spatial awareness and movement.

9
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,498
Next up, gameplay mechanics, which I like to refer to

10
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:30,259
as a level designer's palette, as these are all the things

11
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:32,639
that level designers should be taking creative risks with

12
00:00:32,819 --> 00:00:34,360
in attempt to make the best possible level.

13
00:00:36,015 --> 00:00:38,538
And finally, we'll break down a level beat by beat,

14
00:00:38,918 --> 00:00:41,620
discussing all the core VR considerations along the way.

15
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:45,544
Before we jump into all of that, my name's Harry Shirazi.

16
00:00:45,704 --> 00:00:47,926
I'm the lead level designer at Sony's London studio.

17
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:50,088
And these are some of the games that I've worked on

18
00:00:50,148 --> 00:00:51,930
over the past 10 years as a level designer.

19
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:54,312
For the past five years, however,

20
00:00:54,852 --> 00:00:56,594
I've been working exclusively within VR.

21
00:00:57,414 --> 00:00:59,156
And I think that as a team at London studio,

22
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:01,778
we probably make the most expensive VR titles on the market.

23
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:06,109
So I wanted to share some lessons I've personally learned working in AAA VR,

24
00:01:06,849 --> 00:01:09,630
which I hope will shed light on what I consider to be some must have

25
00:01:09,711 --> 00:01:11,912
considerations whenever making a VR game.

26
00:01:13,152 --> 00:01:15,793
And for those of you who haven't played or seen any of Blood and Truth,

27
00:01:16,594 --> 00:01:17,834
here's the launch trailer for the game.

28
00:01:24,437 --> 00:01:26,058
What do I want? Your operations.

29
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:29,420
He's not going to start an all out war. He's not big enough.

30
00:01:31,562 --> 00:01:32,602
We're gonna go and find out.

31
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:36,105
You're just gonna walk in there?

32
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:16,368
We need to push back hard or we're finished.

33
00:02:16,388 --> 00:02:17,208
For the players.

34
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,913
So from the trailer we can gather that Blood & Truth is an action-adventure FPS

35
00:02:23,773 --> 00:02:27,796
that features some drama in the form of a revenge story, gunplay,

36
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:31,920
fuse breaker puzzles and high action set pieces.

37
00:02:33,317 --> 00:02:34,877
Okay, so as mentioned in the agenda,

38
00:02:34,997 --> 00:02:36,758
we're gonna quickly review what traversal means

39
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:37,418
to Blood & Truth.

40
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,759
To embody one of the core pillars of the game,

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,400
being the action hero means that the controls

42
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,961
need to be as intuitive as possible.

43
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:47,362
And here's a clip of how it works in game.

44
00:02:48,362 --> 00:02:50,283
The player is presented with a choice of waypoints.

45
00:02:50,883 --> 00:02:52,784
When they choose one, they press the move button to go.

46
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:54,764
They can strafe and cover,

47
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:57,625
but the player is always essentially making forward progress

48
00:02:57,765 --> 00:02:59,046
from one piece of cover to another.

49
00:03:00,354 --> 00:03:02,835
Think of it a bit like an automated roadie run in Gears,

50
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:04,737
with the ability to shoot the whole way.

51
00:03:05,657 --> 00:03:08,139
And we actually consulted with a former SAS soldier

52
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:09,840
on how they move in combat situations.

53
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:11,882
And this concept of staying low

54
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:13,543
and pushing forward towards danger

55
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:16,325
actually fits in line with how the SAS operates.

56
00:03:18,247 --> 00:03:20,188
So some comfort considerations to take note of.

57
00:03:21,009 --> 00:03:22,870
We do a small amount of easing in and easing out

58
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,111
when we start and stop moving.

59
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,872
And we also vary the speed

60
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:27,753
depending on the distance that the player has moved.

61
00:03:28,762 --> 00:03:30,902
So the shorter the distance, the slower the movement.

62
00:03:31,442 --> 00:03:33,422
And this is because we found that moving short distances

63
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:34,863
quickly was a comfort trigger.

64
00:03:36,143 --> 00:03:38,243
We also deliberately split up chunks at a level

65
00:03:38,363 --> 00:03:40,444
to work with either standing or crouch traversal.

66
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:42,484
It's moving up and down repeatedly

67
00:03:42,564 --> 00:03:43,964
can also be a comfort trigger too.

68
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:47,185
Finally, we limited backtracking purely

69
00:03:47,225 --> 00:03:48,765
to where all of our weapons are located.

70
00:03:49,686 --> 00:03:51,046
Given the option to backtrack

71
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,726
across the entire traversal graph,

72
00:03:53,306 --> 00:03:55,167
really increased the cognitive load on the player,

73
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:56,787
which could easily lead to confusion

74
00:03:56,827 --> 00:03:57,867
with insider firefights.

75
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:01,650
Given our tagline for the game was be the action hero,

76
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,792
we wanted to make sure our traversal method actually helped the player to fulfill this fantasy.

77
00:04:08,174 --> 00:04:12,336
Here's what it all looks like under the hood. Internally, we refer to this kind of gizmo

78
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:16,499
information as proxies, so I'll be referring to proxy information throughout the rest of the talk.

79
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:21,742
As you can see, it's a spline network. Lots of forward and diagonal movements.

80
00:04:22,702 --> 00:04:26,264
Every time we ever rotate the player is during interactive traversal sections,

81
00:04:26,324 --> 00:04:28,405
where the player uses their hands to climb or crawl.

82
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:31,914
We split the traversal graph into two separate modes.

83
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:34,356
The different colors on the spline represent

84
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,058
pre or post combat and combat.

85
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:40,040
And this simply indicates where you can traverse to

86
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,841
depending on if you're in combat or not.

87
00:04:42,722 --> 00:04:44,383
There's also a little bit of extra information

88
00:04:44,403 --> 00:04:47,405
in the spline proxies indicating the direction of travel.

89
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:50,667
So as a quick tip,

90
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:53,469
I found that traversing through a white box in VR

91
00:04:53,489 --> 00:04:55,230
with just one material can bring with it

92
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,771
some comfort and readability issues.

93
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,337
Essentially, the depth within your level

94
00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:00,558
becomes much harder to read.

95
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:03,100
But luckily, this is easily alleviated

96
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,762
by mapping a different color to all the vertical aspects

97
00:05:05,782 --> 00:05:06,222
of your level.

98
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:08,284
It sounds like a really small thing,

99
00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:11,366
but it really does help to give that sense of depth in VR

100
00:05:11,426 --> 00:05:12,787
that can otherwise be lost.

101
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:16,210
Next on the agenda, metrics.

102
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:19,312
So good metrics are important in all games.

103
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:21,114
But for VR specifically, they can

104
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,375
normalize the base level of comfortable traversal

105
00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:24,216
within your game space.

106
00:05:25,317 --> 00:05:27,458
If you're too close or too far away from something,

107
00:05:28,183 --> 00:05:29,583
then you're genuinely going to feel this.

108
00:05:31,404 --> 00:05:34,145
So this shows the cover metrics that we had in place on our waypoints.

109
00:05:35,365 --> 00:05:39,467
And distance away from the cover was heavily user-tested to ensure the following criteria.

110
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:43,188
Number one, that the player could comfortably see over the cover.

111
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:47,069
Number two, that they could duck their head and feel safe in cover.

112
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:53,292
And three, that anything that we placed on top of the cover, like ammo or weapons, could easily be reached.

113
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:56,413
To ensure that these metrics were fixed,

114
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:59,830
we set up prefabs with something that we called snap zones.

115
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,910
And these are the red planes that you can see

116
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:02,910
over the cover objects.

117
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:04,951
With the snap zones in place,

118
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:07,271
all we had to do was move a waypoint towards an edge

119
00:06:07,392 --> 00:06:08,652
and it would just snap into position.

120
00:06:08,672 --> 00:06:12,373
And this took care of about 90% of the waypoints in the game.

121
00:06:13,013 --> 00:06:14,893
And sometimes depending on the circumstances,

122
00:06:15,153 --> 00:06:16,634
we disabled snapping on a waypoint

123
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,274
and we tweaked the location by hand.

124
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:22,255
To get out of cover comfortably,

125
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:24,576
we baked out splines and curved them

126
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:25,556
around the cover objects.

127
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:28,555
And whilst this was fine for the white box stage,

128
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:30,615
I wasn't particularly comfortable with the fact

129
00:06:30,636 --> 00:06:32,636
that these curves would always be an approximation.

130
00:06:33,256 --> 00:06:35,196
And they had the potential to be implemented

131
00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:37,277
completely differently by each of the level designers.

132
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,217
So how is this gonna scale?

133
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:41,618
And what if our metrics had to change

134
00:06:41,678 --> 00:06:42,858
as a result of a user test?

135
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:45,178
We'd have to go back and update

136
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:46,679
all the traversal splines by hand.

137
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:49,219
And what if the next user test

138
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:50,319
required us to change it again?

139
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,280
So the answer was to set up a metrics based system instead.

140
00:06:55,376 --> 00:06:57,718
Designers now had three different curves available to them,

141
00:06:57,938 --> 00:07:00,120
which could be changed within an INI file.

142
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:01,942
And this would update all the splines

143
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:02,782
within the side of the game.

144
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:06,105
And we still baked out the odd spline here and there,

145
00:07:06,185 --> 00:07:07,506
especially during set pieces.

146
00:07:08,347 --> 00:07:10,049
But just like the snap waypoints before,

147
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:12,791
this system took care of approximately 90% of the game.

148
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:15,914
So now that we have a rail-based traversal system,

149
00:07:16,214 --> 00:07:17,895
metrically driven and tuned to comfort,

150
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:20,037
let's talk about the meat of the game

151
00:07:20,097 --> 00:07:21,318
and explore the gameplay mechanics.

152
00:07:23,668 --> 00:07:25,128
So Blood & Truth's mechanics can be split

153
00:07:25,148 --> 00:07:26,349
into three different categories.

154
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:29,090
First, we have a number of traversal-based ones.

155
00:07:31,591 --> 00:07:33,711
Next, we have some more combat-focused mechanics.

156
00:07:37,393 --> 00:07:38,993
And finally, we have interactables,

157
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:41,654
each of which is entirely concentrated

158
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:43,455
on the use of VR and motion controls.

159
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:46,576
So now we've established Blood & Truth's traversal,

160
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:48,417
metrics, and game mechanics.

161
00:07:49,237 --> 00:07:51,338
The rest is fairly classic level design.

162
00:07:53,162 --> 00:07:55,304
So what I'm going to do now is quickly break down a level

163
00:07:55,344 --> 00:07:57,366
and point out the VR considerations involved

164
00:07:57,406 --> 00:07:57,907
in each scene.

165
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:02,451
And internally, we call this level the HQ.

166
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:04,453
It's around three quarters of the way through,

167
00:08:04,593 --> 00:08:06,034
so by now the player has been introduced

168
00:08:06,054 --> 00:08:07,255
to all the mechanics of the game.

169
00:08:08,296 --> 00:08:09,497
And here's a quick summary of the mission.

170
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:12,280
You and your former SAS buddy Deakin

171
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,142
have been tasked with breaking into

172
00:08:14,182 --> 00:08:15,683
a dubious shell company building

173
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,646
and reporting back on any of the information you may find.

174
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,631
Your handler, Agent Carson, has also provided you

175
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:25,373
with a Trojan to upload to the bad guy systems.

176
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:27,594
OK, let's step through.

177
00:08:28,215 --> 00:08:30,056
It starts with a classic planning montage,

178
00:08:30,856 --> 00:08:33,698
a filmic technique used in films like Mission Impossible,

179
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:36,380
where you plan and execute the mission at the same time.

180
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:39,122
And we don't have any bloody AI within the game,

181
00:08:39,682 --> 00:08:41,223
but still wanted to explore how we

182
00:08:41,243 --> 00:08:43,905
could have you and an NPC work together across a mission.

183
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:46,847
So first things first, you decide

184
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:48,868
to recon the shell company building with a drone.

185
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:52,420
And as we fly over the building site,

186
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,580
we discover the following.

187
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,521
We need to find a way to disable the generator

188
00:08:56,561 --> 00:08:57,481
powering the floodlights,

189
00:08:58,602 --> 00:09:00,462
and that we need a key card to get into the building.

190
00:09:01,903 --> 00:09:03,243
And often one of the things that we find

191
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:04,504
with new players to VR

192
00:09:04,624 --> 00:09:06,644
is that they can get stuck staring in one direction.

193
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,825
This elevated position here

194
00:09:08,885 --> 00:09:10,666
gives us a unique view of the building site.

195
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:13,307
And it's just can encourage the player

196
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:14,827
to look around the scene a little bit more.

197
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:16,908
And as a quick win,

198
00:09:17,268 --> 00:09:19,669
we literally just reused our on-foot traversal mechanic

199
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:20,269
for the drone move.

200
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,760
And then we added some post-processing

201
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,820
and a little bit of audio.

202
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,461
And this gave us the impression

203
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,362
that we're actually looking through the camera of the drone.

204
00:09:28,462 --> 00:09:30,263
Okay, so once we've learned everything we need to,

205
00:09:31,883 --> 00:09:33,604
we montage cut back to the safe house.

206
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:36,245
Now we make a plan to get into the building site.

207
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:38,966
Beacon will set off the fire alarms remotely

208
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:41,127
whilst the player disguise themselves as an electrician.

209
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:43,628
And for these quick in-between drama scenes,

210
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:45,809
we placed different interactables around the table,

211
00:09:46,229 --> 00:09:47,830
beer bottles, plans, et cetera,

212
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,411
giving the player a chance to role play along with the scene.

213
00:09:51,487 --> 00:09:54,287
To me, this is about as cut scene as it should ever get in VR.

214
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:57,328
Remember that the player always has control over the camera.

215
00:09:57,528 --> 00:09:59,569
So it's nice for them to have a little extra agency

216
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:00,649
with inside the drama scenes.

217
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,571
Once again, we've montage cut exactly where we need to be.

218
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,512
In this case, we gain access to the site wearing

219
00:10:08,552 --> 00:10:09,652
our electrician's disguise.

220
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:12,013
And once we're in front of the generator,

221
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:16,094
we fix the alarms by planting some remote activated decord.

222
00:10:17,274 --> 00:10:19,155
With this type of interaction, we affectionately

223
00:10:19,215 --> 00:10:21,135
refer to internally as a bod.

224
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,491
which stood for box of delights.

225
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:27,554
I actually read an article online where a journalist had coined the term

226
00:10:28,214 --> 00:10:32,197
fuse breaker puzzles, which I guess is a much better back of the box quote,

227
00:10:32,497 --> 00:10:35,299
but I might refer to bots throughout the rest of the talk.

228
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,462
So we had three tiers of fidelity for these interaction puzzles.

229
00:10:40,242 --> 00:10:42,324
This one's a tier three due to its simplicity.

230
00:10:42,784 --> 00:10:45,786
We unscrew a panel, put on a deck cord, job done.

231
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:49,829
Tier two is more of a puzzle and requires at least some thought.

232
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:52,549
and likely takes a few more steps to complete as well.

233
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,430
Tier one is what we would call a hero asset.

234
00:10:56,971 --> 00:10:58,511
This still uses all the same kit parts

235
00:10:58,551 --> 00:11:00,092
we used to create the rest of our boards,

236
00:11:00,632 --> 00:11:02,613
things like the buttons, joysticks, sliders,

237
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:04,794
but the main difference is the kit parts

238
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:06,615
drive fairly bespoke actions,

239
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:09,956
like tracking an NPC's movements through CCTV.

240
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,397
The really important thing to take note of here

241
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:15,818
is that we're never pressing X to play something.

242
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:18,139
We're always asking the player to use their hands

243
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:18,980
to perform actions.

244
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:23,501
Okay, so the generator has been fixed with a deck cord.

245
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:26,143
Next, we need the foreman's ID card.

246
00:11:26,543 --> 00:11:27,583
So back at the safe house,

247
00:11:27,964 --> 00:11:29,685
Deacon has a plan to distract the foreman,

248
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,686
dressed as the maintenance man for his building.

249
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:36,029
So it looks like we'll have to climb up some scaffolding

250
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:37,610
to break into the foreman's apartment.

251
00:11:38,651 --> 00:11:41,012
As mentioned earlier, the player can yaw rotate

252
00:11:41,072 --> 00:11:43,354
during interactive traversal segments like this.

253
00:11:44,415 --> 00:11:45,816
We can see this here as the player

254
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:48,097
is physically pulling themselves along the scaffolding.

255
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:51,200
And putting rotation into the player's hands like this

256
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,421
is a huge comfort boost,

257
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:55,063
likely because the tiny inner ear muscles

258
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,385
are responsible for balance or in motion

259
00:11:57,645 --> 00:11:59,507
as you perform the actions.

260
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:04,451
So once we're in, we give Deacon a heads up over comms.

261
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,754
Again, we don't feature any kind of buddy AI in the game.

262
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,575
So Deacon's presence in the scene

263
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:10,997
is entirely driven through VO.

264
00:12:11,817 --> 00:12:13,539
And as we start rifling through some drawers,

265
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,721
we can hear him distracting the foreman downstairs.

266
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:19,552
Eventually we find a lock drawer with the ID card inside.

267
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:25,273
So here's a screenshot of what our climbing implementation looks like in editor.

268
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:29,494
These are basically prefab curves that we know to be of uncomfortable limits.

269
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:34,596
The proxy or gizmo information shows the distance that we can pull ourselves around in.

270
00:12:35,756 --> 00:12:39,597
We also experiment with adding the simulated feeling of weight to the climbing interaction.

271
00:12:40,357 --> 00:12:44,918
Without any of this, although it's completely one-to-one, it also felt like you were superhuman.

272
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:49,216
So we tune to the balance of an action hero more like John McClane instead.

273
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:52,418
Okay.

274
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,159
So for a game of blood in the title, we've gone through the first 10 minutes

275
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:56,900
of the mission and we haven't even killed anyone yet.

276
00:12:57,621 --> 00:12:58,582
So we're going to fix that now.

277
00:12:59,522 --> 00:13:00,583
Job well done on the planning.

278
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:02,804
We got the ID card and we planted the debt court.

279
00:13:03,445 --> 00:13:04,465
It's time for a set piece.

280
00:13:05,386 --> 00:13:06,687
Base jumping over the river Thames.

281
00:13:10,729 --> 00:13:11,690
So as you can see here.

282
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:14,389
There's some basic functionality on the parachute,

283
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:16,471
allowing the player to bank from side to side.

284
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:20,013
You can also push up or pull down on the parachute cords

285
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:21,434
to raise and lower yourself.

286
00:13:22,515 --> 00:13:25,237
The editor proxy information here shows how far on the X

287
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:27,278
and Y we can maneuver within the parachutes.

288
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:30,420
You can then see how we funnel this in,

289
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,722
so the player lands exactly where we want them to.

290
00:13:33,082 --> 00:13:34,303
It's pretty basic stuff, really.

291
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:38,065
So Deacon sets off the deck cord we planted earlier,

292
00:13:38,105 --> 00:13:39,727
remotely, taking down the lights

293
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:41,468
and covering your entry into the building site.

294
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:45,290
it looks like there's some hired goons patrolling.

295
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:49,313
In Blood & Truth, as you basically keep making forward progress,

296
00:13:50,074 --> 00:13:53,156
we keep the player from pushing too far forward in combat scenarios

297
00:13:53,196 --> 00:13:54,857
by splitting up scenes into sections.

298
00:13:55,898 --> 00:13:58,300
And these sections open up when the player takes out enemies.

299
00:13:58,721 --> 00:14:00,162
So this creates a pretty simple loop.

300
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:03,084
Take out an enemy, open up a new chunk.

301
00:14:05,106 --> 00:14:07,808
And this is what the traversal graph looks like within this building site.

302
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:11,170
The level designers were responsible for the level's layout

303
00:14:11,371 --> 00:14:12,652
as well as all the traversal markup.

304
00:14:13,572 --> 00:14:15,673
And this meant that every single cover point in the game

305
00:14:15,873 --> 00:14:17,573
has gone through some considerable testing

306
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:19,214
and that we can guarantee the player's always

307
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:20,574
gonna have a fun route through a level.

308
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:22,935
So now that the building site's clear,

309
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:26,015
we can use the ID card that we jacked earlier

310
00:14:26,035 --> 00:14:26,836
to get into the building.

311
00:14:28,436 --> 00:14:30,336
Now, when you break in somewhere,

312
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,017
it makes sense that one of the first things

313
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,958
you might be greeted with is a security camera.

314
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:36,398
And in blood and truth,

315
00:14:36,678 --> 00:14:38,579
these essentially work as lock and key puzzles.

316
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:41,339
The player must now either hack the camera

317
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,100
or start a firefight to progress.

318
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,598
So let's take a look at the stealthier approach.

319
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:49,639
To hack the camera, we use one of the bots

320
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:50,759
that we talked about earlier.

321
00:14:51,619 --> 00:14:53,240
And we've done a similar kind of thing to this

322
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,800
in flat screen games for years now.

323
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:57,801
Remember using the analog sticks to hack things

324
00:14:57,841 --> 00:14:59,062
with inside of the Arkham games?

325
00:15:00,202 --> 00:15:02,243
Well, this is exactly the same kind of gameplay beat

326
00:15:02,283 --> 00:15:03,063
that we're looking for.

327
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:04,463
But because it's in VR,

328
00:15:04,843 --> 00:15:07,364
you have that extra tactility at your disposal,

329
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:09,285
which should absolutely be factored

330
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,365
into the design of the puzzle.

331
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:12,726
And we came up with the.

332
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:15,530
Box of the Delights in the middle of production,

333
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,432
which obviously the producers weren't extremely happy with,

334
00:15:18,712 --> 00:15:20,553
but it felt like we didn't have enough

335
00:15:20,593 --> 00:15:22,715
in the level design palette to break up the gunplay.

336
00:15:23,776 --> 00:15:25,617
So we formed a three-person strike team

337
00:15:25,897 --> 00:15:28,339
and basically designed and implemented them all

338
00:15:28,479 --> 00:15:30,440
within around 10 weeks, start to finish.

339
00:15:31,941 --> 00:15:33,402
And here's what the puzzle used to look like

340
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:35,043
before we switched out the designer art.

341
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:37,965
And not that I want to give you the advice of,

342
00:15:38,325 --> 00:15:40,987
if it doesn't feel right, add more stuff during production.

343
00:15:41,812 --> 00:15:47,336
But this is a perfect example of what can be accomplished in a short time frame with minimal resources.

344
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:54,080
Okay, so whilst we're in this maintenance corridor, let's take a look at the layout and why this makes sense for Blood & Truth.

345
00:15:56,282 --> 00:16:02,907
This security room to the right, in a normal FPS, it would make total sense that the door was placed here instead.

346
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:07,020
It's a small thing, but it gives the space an extra dimension, right?

347
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,180
It might even feel a little bit more normal,

348
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,061
as it's very rare to enter a building

349
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:13,981
and have all of the doors facing the exact same direction.

350
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:17,282
In blood and truth, this was actually a level design challenge.

351
00:16:17,902 --> 00:16:20,542
And we got around this by extending the width of the level

352
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:22,663
to accommodate doors being on the forward axis.

353
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,243
So looking at the top down,

354
00:16:26,244 --> 00:16:27,964
we can see how the level is split into channels.

355
00:16:29,038 --> 00:16:30,519
And this gives the player some options

356
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:32,600
and fits in line with our traversal method,

357
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,001
which doesn't feature snap turning.

358
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:37,002
And when we did use your race rotations,

359
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:38,903
we designed our level sections to curve

360
00:16:38,923 --> 00:16:40,244
at the same time that the player did,

361
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:42,425
creating a corridor like feeling

362
00:16:42,445 --> 00:16:44,246
and helping to relax the curve visually.

363
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:46,306
And this featured most prominently

364
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:48,267
with inside the run gun sections of our game.

365
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:50,749
So here's an example from the casino level.

366
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:54,550
We can see that there's a curve on the inside corner here.

367
00:16:55,687 --> 00:16:57,788
We travel around it following the forward tangent

368
00:16:57,888 --> 00:16:59,569
of the spline at a very relaxed pace.

369
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:02,190
And we also found that the corners didn't need

370
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,411
to be a hundred percent smooth curve.

371
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,532
So we can see with this next corner,

372
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:09,613
it's actually fairly faceted,

373
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:11,694
but it still helps to lead the eye,

374
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:14,395
which in turn helps the brain to process it spatially.

375
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:16,976
And here's what this looks like in editor.

376
00:17:19,017 --> 00:17:20,058
Another thing that really helped

377
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:23,279
is the highly choreographed enemy placement around a scene.

378
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:26,713
This helps to not only push the action hero pillar of the game,

379
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:28,855
but it also makes great use of VR

380
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:30,596
as the gunplay is happening all around you.

381
00:17:33,398 --> 00:17:34,179
So back to our level.

382
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,681
Next, we Jimmy open the lift shaft,

383
00:17:37,721 --> 00:17:40,583
and then we go subterranean by hanging on the underside

384
00:17:40,603 --> 00:17:42,105
of a lift as it starts moving,

385
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:45,827
and then we enter the evil base proper.

386
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:49,610
So this is where you want to start putting it all together.

387
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:52,468
The player's done all of that legwork with Deacon

388
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,328
during the planning phase to get into the base.

389
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:57,069
So now we increase the intensity curve

390
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,630
and start giving the player some options.

391
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,331
On this floor, we've got a number of different room setups,

392
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:04,572
which gives this base a labyrinth-like feel.

393
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:06,553
We've got some patrolling guards

394
00:18:06,573 --> 00:18:09,294
with the classic evil base style uniforms on,

395
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:13,976
and a fuse breaker puzzle leading into a room full of loot.

396
00:18:14,836 --> 00:18:16,997
The player can actually find an ID card for this room

397
00:18:17,017 --> 00:18:18,497
if they search through some nearby drawers,

398
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:19,778
or they can hack in.

399
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:23,168
but this obviously increases the chance of setting off the alarms

400
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:24,528
and alerting guards to your presence.

401
00:18:25,448 --> 00:18:27,369
For this playthrough, we'll carry on stealthily.

402
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:30,710
Okay, so let's review the top-down of the space

403
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,090
and look at the traversal network.

404
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:37,151
So we have our familiar forward-facing openings,

405
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,492
and the space is put up into channels,

406
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,053
leading to a pinch point at the end of the room.

407
00:18:46,214 --> 00:18:47,534
As we progress further through the base,

408
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:51,981
we come across a variation on a fusebreaker puzzle that gets a little bit more complicated.

409
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:56,724
Each of these fusebreaker prefabs had prefixed waypoint destinations.

410
00:18:57,425 --> 00:19:03,328
And to help us establish these positions, we created some really super simple metric guides to visualize the interaction range.

411
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:09,372
There isn't anything dynamic or fancy about this. It's just warping the lines of averaged ergonomics.

412
00:19:11,473 --> 00:19:13,815
In this next room, we force a really large firefight.

413
00:19:14,504 --> 00:19:18,848
This is purely to mix up the beats at a level by increasing the intensity and breaking up the stealth.

414
00:19:19,988 --> 00:19:22,630
So as a combat arena, the space is wide and symmetrical.

415
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:26,293
The player can choose to progress up either flank or down the center.

416
00:19:27,454 --> 00:19:30,276
It's lit with cover points and enemies flood in from all directions.

417
00:19:31,457 --> 00:19:34,019
And this cover setup gives the player a lot of freedom of movement

418
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,202
and allows them to move laterally from one side of the level to the other.

419
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:42,286
And we also decided to push the ceiling higher, giving us more varied shooting angles.

420
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,033
and also making it easier for grenades to be thrown longer distances.

421
00:19:47,514 --> 00:19:50,416
So once the firefight is over, Deacon and Ryan update each other

422
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:52,458
through VO and we head deeper into the base.

423
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,883
So we wanted to chunk in a section that made it feel like the baddies

424
00:19:58,903 --> 00:20:00,103
were still expanding this base.

425
00:20:00,864 --> 00:20:04,027
And this screenshot can show how the art and design teams work

426
00:20:04,047 --> 00:20:05,448
together to present new ideas.

427
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:08,930
Adding this section and cutting another.

428
00:20:09,368 --> 00:20:13,170
helped us to provide an area where the look and feel is totally different to the rest of the level,

429
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,611
but continues to work on similar principles.

430
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:19,792
So along with the standard guards, we also have a generator.

431
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,134
And using a kit part from one of our bods,

432
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,615
we can flip a switch to turn off some lights.

433
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:28,977
And if you do this, a guard will react and go off to investigate.

434
00:20:29,657 --> 00:20:32,958
And this leaves you with one less enemy to take out if a firefight breaks out.

435
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:37,200
I also wanted to show here what I like to call a legitimate hack.

436
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:42,799
So we integrated a stealth route on the left side of the level

437
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,940
where you can crawl on the top of these boxes,

438
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:47,142
staying low and peeking through.

439
00:20:48,443 --> 00:20:49,564
To make things easy for us,

440
00:20:49,984 --> 00:20:52,006
we simply reskinned the vent crawl prefab.

441
00:20:52,987 --> 00:20:55,268
And that way, everything that stays inside of the metrics,

442
00:20:55,569 --> 00:20:57,250
and all we're doing is swapping out some meshes.

443
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,632
So here's a side-by-side comparison.

444
00:21:05,776 --> 00:21:06,797
Once we get through the tunnel,

445
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:08,959
we get to another bot interaction.

446
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,992
If we found the code on the notepad in the previous section,

447
00:21:12,032 --> 00:21:13,013
we can just type that in.

448
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:14,774
Otherwise we can hack it,

449
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:16,916
which again has a slightly more difficult setup.

450
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:20,118
Earlier, I talked about the fuse breaker puzzles

451
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,579
embodying the same kind of beat

452
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,340
as using a gadget in the Arkham games.

453
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:25,942
And this intensity graph shows us

454
00:21:26,002 --> 00:21:27,623
how far through the level we currently are.

455
00:21:28,444 --> 00:21:30,265
Studying it, we can see that there are lots

456
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:32,187
of evenly spaced out drops in intensity.

457
00:21:33,047 --> 00:21:34,528
And although this is fairly typical

458
00:21:34,568 --> 00:21:35,709
in action adventure missions,

459
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,311
it's important to look at it through the lens of VR.

460
00:21:39,476 --> 00:21:43,139
If you've just come out of an intense battle or you're about to go into one,

461
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:47,802
giving the player a rest helps to avoid something we like to call VR fatigue.

462
00:21:49,664 --> 00:21:54,367
Carrying on with our mission, Deacon takes out a guard and updates us further on what he's seen in

463
00:21:54,387 --> 00:21:58,571
the base. And this further builds on that feeling that we're still on a mission with him.

464
00:21:59,912 --> 00:22:03,294
And the positioning of these narrative moments is something that we spend a lot of time on at

465
00:22:03,354 --> 00:22:07,698
London Studio. This is all in an effort to make sure that the players get a great view of an

466
00:22:07,738 --> 00:22:08,538
actor's performance.

467
00:22:10,977 --> 00:22:12,137
We're getting close to the end now,

468
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:14,039
so the intensity curve is trending higher.

469
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,041
And this room features a lot of lateral cover,

470
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:20,163
gaps between creating channels for the player to move forward.

471
00:22:20,984 --> 00:22:23,085
And our cover metrics are ensuring that all the ammo

472
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,066
and grenades are placed within comfortable distance.

473
00:22:26,307 --> 00:22:28,589
And the shelving here also creates a nice cover type

474
00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:30,190
that is completely unique to VR.

475
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:32,892
With all the gaps between the boxes,

476
00:22:33,212 --> 00:22:35,173
the player has to physically search for an opening

477
00:22:35,213 --> 00:22:36,094
to shoot enemies through.

478
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,332
This could be even more effective in stealth sections,

479
00:22:39,452 --> 00:22:41,454
giving the player that feeling of being a hunter.

480
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:46,318
In the last room of the level, you plant the Trojan,

481
00:22:46,518 --> 00:22:49,280
triggering a violent shootout on a massive storage elevator.

482
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:52,403
And this combination of the epic scale of this room

483
00:22:52,703 --> 00:22:54,764
and the dynamic movement you get from the elevator

484
00:22:55,325 --> 00:22:57,727
gives us a fitting combat scenario for the end of our level.

485
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:00,389
To me, it embodies the power of VR,

486
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:03,351
transporting the player into a location and situation

487
00:23:03,892 --> 00:23:05,933
that they're likely never to experience in real life.

488
00:23:06,943 --> 00:23:09,305
and giving them a chance to role play as an action hero.

489
00:23:10,786 --> 00:23:11,466
So there we have it.

490
00:23:12,287 --> 00:23:16,289
In summary, pay extra special attention to metric data.

491
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,211
The last and first thing you want to be worrying about

492
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,932
when making a game is comfort issues.

493
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:23,514
Establish your game mechanics.

494
00:23:24,074 --> 00:23:26,395
Think about what makes them only possible in VR.

495
00:23:27,376 --> 00:23:29,097
It doesn't need to be some super expensive

496
00:23:29,457 --> 00:23:30,098
360 dream sequence.

497
00:23:30,718 --> 00:23:33,059
I mean, those are cool, but even something as simple

498
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:35,161
as throwing a scrunched up paper ball into a bin

499
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:36,341
can be quite magical in VR.

500
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:40,863
Review your level often and keep asking yourself the question,

501
00:23:41,524 --> 00:23:42,725
how can it be more VR?

502
00:23:43,886 --> 00:23:45,948
And finally, play lots of VR games.

503
00:23:46,588 --> 00:23:48,049
Some awesome games out there now that

504
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:49,270
will serve as an inspiration.

505
00:23:49,811 --> 00:23:52,053
For example, if you haven't already played Blood and Truth,

506
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,275
why not go pick yourself up a copy?

507
00:23:55,876 --> 00:23:56,997
So I hope this little run through

508
00:23:57,037 --> 00:23:58,178
has helped anyone that's thinking

509
00:23:58,238 --> 00:24:00,260
about how to translate their work into VR

510
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,302
and how some of the more typical action adventure principles

511
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:04,303
can work within the field.

512
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:07,145
Thank you very much for listening.

513
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:10,555
You're more than welcome to mail me if you have any questions regarding the talk.

514
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:11,617
Thanks again.
