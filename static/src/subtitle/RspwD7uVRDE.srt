00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,511
Welcome to our talk.

2
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:12,553
We will talk about farming simulator today.

3
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:15,455
I'm Christian Amann from China Software.

4
00:00:15,555 --> 00:00:16,996
This is Stefan Geiger.

5
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:18,577
We will split the talk in the middle.

6
00:00:20,238 --> 00:00:24,661
And before we talk, this will be recorded, so please mute your cell phone.

7
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:26,082
OK.

8
00:00:26,682 --> 00:00:28,843
We will start with a little introduction.

9
00:00:29,975 --> 00:00:33,657
For myself, as I said, I'm Christian Amann.

10
00:00:34,478 --> 00:00:37,280
I have a master's in computer science.

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:47,867
I worked a bit in the video games industry some years for Sony PlayStation and also for NVIDIA as a software engineer.

12
00:00:50,488 --> 00:00:54,071
Before, I founded China Software together with Stefan Geiger.

13
00:00:56,355 --> 00:00:58,117
This is a short intro of Stefan.

14
00:00:58,157 --> 00:01:00,380
Stefan also has a master's degree in computer science.

15
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,408
He worked shortly at the Sensory Motor Lab before co-founding Giant Software in 2008 together with me.

16
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:12,368
A short slide about Giant Software.

17
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:18,512
We are developer, publisher of the Farming Simulator series.

18
00:01:19,133 --> 00:01:25,017
We have offices in Zurich, in Germany, in the Czech Republic, and in the US.

19
00:01:26,317 --> 00:01:33,863
And we develop games for pretty much all platforms that make sense, from consoles to mobile, also PC.

20
00:01:35,724 --> 00:01:35,944
Sorry.

21
00:01:36,912 --> 00:01:38,858
Okay, let's just start.

22
00:01:43,342 --> 00:01:44,662
the history of Farming Simulator.

23
00:01:45,683 --> 00:01:51,245
Both of us, Stefan and me, we share the passion for video games and programming.

24
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:59,427
And we dreamt of developing a game engine and creating video games in Switzerland.

25
00:02:00,268 --> 00:02:01,848
And that's a fun fact.

26
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,810
Almost 20 years ago, we visited together the GDC here in San Francisco.

27
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,612
And that was the point where we decided to bring this dream into reality.

28
00:02:14,153 --> 00:02:22,903
So in 2007, a friend, Martin Beowulf, suggested us to create a farming simulator.

29
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:23,964
So he had this idea.

30
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:31,133
He was pretty much obsessed by this idea to create this game because he loved such a game to play.

31
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:44,577
And so what we did, we concluded a bit of research, and we also launched a web forum with a small prototype of a farming simulator game.

32
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:56,068
And through that feedback we got, and also through market research, we were convinced that there's a potential and also demand for such a game in the market.

33
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,772
So this was pretty much the start.

34
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:02,274
2007, long time ago.

35
00:03:04,256 --> 00:03:12,783
There were a lot of challenges in 2007 to enter the games market as a fresh developer, indie developer so to say.

36
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,305
Self-publishing a video game was a major challenge in the past.

37
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:28,993
The dominant way of selling games was back then still physical retail distribution.

38
00:03:30,194 --> 00:03:32,116
So that was difficult.

39
00:03:32,817 --> 00:03:40,266
And digital platforms that are available nowadays are very accessible, were close to indie developers.

40
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:43,870
So Steam was only open for indie developers 2012.

41
00:03:46,002 --> 00:03:48,703
So that was also not possible to go that route.

42
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:53,385
And there's another big, major obstacle to take.

43
00:03:54,145 --> 00:03:55,706
It was the game engine itself.

44
00:03:56,446 --> 00:04:01,468
So game engines like Unity and Unreal, they were not accessible at that point.

45
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:07,771
Unity didn't really exist, and Unreal Engine was too expensive at that point for us to license.

46
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:12,012
So those were the challenges we had to overcome.

47
00:04:15,287 --> 00:04:16,028
What did we do?

48
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:22,995
We tried to search a publisher, really traditional way of doing a video games project.

49
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,258
And we actually found a small publisher.

50
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:40,471
in Germany that we could do a contract, a distribution deal, that we also got a small minimum guarantee for the contract.

51
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:47,474
But the guarantee was so small we could barely upgrade our Maya licenses to commercial

52
00:04:48,683 --> 00:04:55,105
We used Maya for pretty much all the assets of the game, so that was necessary of course.

53
00:04:55,825 --> 00:05:00,646
So that was it, that was the start of the development of Farming Simulator.

54
00:05:03,207 --> 00:05:09,949
It was a true independent game development to say, so we lived in a shared apartment to save costs.

55
00:05:11,059 --> 00:05:14,660
and we did everything beside our day jobs.

56
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:25,062
So I was still working for NVIDIA at that point, part-time, and Stefan was at university finishing his master degree.

57
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:39,325
So it took us about nine months of development time and we could release the first version April 14th, 2008, and it really sold a lot.

58
00:05:40,894 --> 00:05:48,904
So we sold, for the first version, which was only pretty much sold physical and only in Europe, 250,000 units.

59
00:05:49,184 --> 00:05:53,509
And this was really crazy.

60
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,712
What happened at that time is there was,

61
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:02,786
a trend of simulation games became popular again.

62
00:06:02,846 --> 00:06:17,561
So in the 90s there was quite a big genre and then around 2008 it was kind of a resurgence in popularity in the simulation genre, which is also nice.

63
00:06:19,364 --> 00:06:22,125
could have helped us to sell units.

64
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:30,628
I will now talk a bit about the game design, the ideas we had behind the game.

65
00:06:32,388 --> 00:06:40,471
Of course, Farming Slater is a simulation game, so the primary objective is to simulate a farming experience, per se.

66
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:46,273
So the players are tasked to planting and harvesting corpse.

67
00:06:47,891 --> 00:06:48,171
crops.

68
00:06:51,394 --> 00:06:56,579
So this also involves managing livestock, buying and selling agricultural equipment.

69
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:09,951
And what we also did from the start, we licensed farm brands to put into the game like John Deere and other brands to make the game as authentic as possible.

70
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:12,130
So, next slide.

71
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:22,647
To create a simulation game, we had to choose between entertainment and

72
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:42,860
realism or authenticity and it was crucial I think to have a good balance because on the other hand you want a lot of realism to make the game as real as possible but we also want to keep the game as fun as possible and that's very important for us to find the right balance

73
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,046
also to make the game successful in the market.

74
00:07:49,328 --> 00:07:52,753
We tried very hard and we think we were not bad at that.

75
00:07:54,135 --> 00:08:00,303
In most cases we favored entertainment, so fun was always more important than realism.

76
00:08:01,702 --> 00:08:09,948
And I think that was also something which we did a bit different to other simulation games at the same time that were on the market.

77
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:15,012
We really favored entertainment and not realism.

78
00:08:18,314 --> 00:08:18,974
Influences.

79
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:24,899
Yeah, we got influences, of course, by a lot of great games of that time.

80
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,683
Maybe to mention here is Grand Theft Auto and also Battlefield.

81
00:08:32,694 --> 00:08:36,779
There are open world games, that was of course for us important to create an open world game.

82
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:46,710
What we also got from those games was this concept, which was pretty much new to simulation games, that you can enter and exit the vehicle at any time.

83
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:59,301
It's important for us that you can then also move around independently of a vehicle and also interact a bit with the environment.

84
00:08:59,801 --> 00:09:08,586
And this gives you this kind of control of an immersion in the world that you are, as the simulation is.

85
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:24,255
I think this also helped to make the game interesting to a younger audience, and that's also a huge difference we see compared to traditional simulation titles like Flight Simulator, Train and Truck Simulator.

86
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:36,199
We have a much younger audience that plays our games, and I think one of the reasons is that we added newer features, for example that.

87
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:43,911
A bit more about the balance between entertainment and realism.

88
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:49,314
So easy to play game design was a huge priority for us.

89
00:09:50,074 --> 00:09:56,898
What we did is certain automation to simplify certain gameplay mechanics.

90
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:00,840
So we tried to reduce the number of buttons that were used.

91
00:10:02,137 --> 00:10:16,545
and we also introduced a context sensitive help system so in all situations all the buttons that make sense to use were showed on the upper left screen

92
00:10:17,566 --> 00:10:21,207
because we had this experience from those simulation games.

93
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:33,569
They were great, like I just remember Falcon 3, a flight simulation game, but you had to remember like 100 keys to use it, and that was just not so practical.

94
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:40,471
So that's something we came up and thought, yeah, that could be cool, that you don't need to remember all the buttons.

95
00:10:45,356 --> 00:10:54,283
OK, what we also did is we, of course, also added advanced gameplay mechanics, because we need to have a certain depth in the gameplay.

96
00:10:55,223 --> 00:10:57,685
And what we did is we add that optionally.

97
00:10:57,785 --> 00:11:00,587
So it was not, for a lot of things, it's not mandatory.

98
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:04,330
But you still can have that gameplay if you want to.

99
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,052
And this is something we did a lot in the sequels.

100
00:11:07,693 --> 00:11:11,616
We added more and more complex gameplay, but it was optional.

101
00:11:12,276 --> 00:11:16,257
So you're not obliged to use them.

102
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:20,459
It's free.

103
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:22,279
Of course, yeah, we released the game.

104
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:25,380
And there was a lot of feedback.

105
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,101
Some feedback was the game is too simplistic.

106
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:35,383
So there were hardcore fans in the community of the game that said, yeah, you can't make such a shit.

107
00:11:35,503 --> 00:11:36,343
It's a toy game.

108
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,904
It's not a real simulation game.

109
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:47,769
So for example, the attachment of the combine header, so this bar in the front of the combine harvester, it was just one button.

110
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:51,371
You attach, lower, and turn it on.

111
00:11:52,031 --> 00:11:53,071
And this was too simple.

112
00:11:53,352 --> 00:11:57,033
And then we went back and made it a bit more complex.

113
00:11:57,834 --> 00:12:03,056
And there were other elements that we also had to change or adapt.

114
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:20,328
In the end, user feedback was always very, very crucial and still is today for us to develop the game further and to decide which is important, which is not for the game.

115
00:12:20,929 --> 00:12:22,550
That was from the start.

116
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:28,036
Even before the first version was released, we got feedback and were able to even

117
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:34,741
with the first videos we released, we could incorporate feedback from the community into the game, which is quite cool.

118
00:12:36,843 --> 00:12:37,743
Yeah, so to say.

119
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:49,152
So the rest of the talk, we will talk about the three defining features of a farm insulator, career mode, modding, and also multiplayer.

120
00:12:49,732 --> 00:12:53,876
Career mode, we introduced pretty much from the beginning of the series in 2008.

121
00:12:56,197 --> 00:12:59,140
The ability to mod was in the first iteration.

122
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,542
We enhanced it quite substantially with the second version.

123
00:13:03,623 --> 00:13:07,827
And multiplayer was introduced in the third iteration in 2010.

124
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:13,491
Let's talk about career mode.

125
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:18,235
The career mode in Farming Simulator adds progression and challenge.

126
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:35,453
So the player can start with basic farm equipment with a small amount of money and then gradually build his farm and earn more money to purchase larger and more powerful farming tools and so on.

127
00:13:35,934 --> 00:13:41,098
The mode was at that time quite unique among simulation games.

128
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:52,270
And I think the important part is that it adds a level of progression and goal setting that was not present in other games at that time, simulation games at that time.

129
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:56,611
So that was, I think, an important part of the success.

130
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:02,992
What was the inspiration of the career mode?

131
00:14:03,032 --> 00:14:06,352
So there are two things that inspired us.

132
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:09,613
First, RPG games.

133
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:15,327
that have this kind of leveling up or experience points and skill trees.

134
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:23,252
But also, like in sports management games, you see economy management that is also an inspiration to us.

135
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:35,121
And those elements, they're kind of a natural addition to the whole theme of this game in farming.

136
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:46,027
I think it adds a lot of engagement and realism, because farmers, they need to manage their equipment and their farm.

137
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:48,929
And there's also, of course, financial management.

138
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:55,573
So they need to see if they have enough money to buy certain equipment or exchange certain equipment to bigger equipment.

139
00:14:55,593 --> 00:14:59,275
That's just the natural part of a farmer's daily life.

140
00:15:00,456 --> 00:15:06,840
So for us, this was important to get this full spectrum of farming into the game.

141
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:13,716
and as I said this was not found in other simulation titles at that point.

142
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:23,874
Another element that is really interesting to talk about is the micro gameplay of the game.

143
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:34,859
So the micro gameplay is really when you work on the field, the lanes of the field go up and down to cultivate, to plow, to seed, or to harvest.

144
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:39,482
Or there's also, like if you sell goods, you have to drive to a selling point.

145
00:15:40,282 --> 00:15:41,722
and then sell the goods.

146
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:58,166
This is something we quite early we added so called AI workers that will do those jobs because driving up and down the field for hours is maybe a bit boring as a game in the long term.

147
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:01,527
So we added automation mechanisms into the game.

148
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:05,555
so that you don't have to do that yourself.

149
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:08,836
So you can hire workers and then they will do the work for you.

150
00:16:08,896 --> 00:16:12,317
It costs a bit of money, of course, but they will do the job for you.

151
00:16:12,997 --> 00:16:18,299
So this is interesting in contrast to the macro gameplay.

152
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:29,842
So if you have the micro gameplay, so to say, automated, you can concentrate on the macro level.

153
00:16:31,377 --> 00:16:33,558
And this is something that you see.

154
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:41,160
A good example is Factorio, where you have a low-level gameplay mechanics layer.

155
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:50,282
And then as soon as you have figured it out, you can concentrate on a more higher level of the gameplay and play there.

156
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:57,164
So this is very, very similar to those construction and management simulation games like Factorio and others.

157
00:16:58,424 --> 00:17:00,285
So that's quite an interesting

158
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:09,560
This is already the end of my part.

159
00:17:10,261 --> 00:17:12,222
We will switch over to Stefan.

160
00:17:16,404 --> 00:17:21,667
Yeah, so let's get into another very important aspect of the game which is modding.

161
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:30,612
So basically we kind of grew up around some of the biggest modding successes like Counter-Strike and

162
00:17:31,257 --> 00:17:40,306
Fans of the Asians and other big titles that were pretty popular with modding like Battlefield and Honor Tournament.

163
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:47,413
So for us it was kind of natural that modding needs to be part of the game as well.

164
00:17:48,387 --> 00:18:00,450
because we also see kind of all the benefits from it that kind of gives the players that long-term playability and having the options to fully customize their game to what they like it.

165
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:15,594
And also it kind of gives a lot of free content for us because we've not been able to or probably no company is able to produce that much content that the community is able to.

166
00:18:19,215 --> 00:18:30,322
To give you a short view what kind of the modding is in Farming Simulator, I have a short video that kind of shows a couple mods.

167
00:18:32,223 --> 00:18:43,571
Like, of course, there's a lot of kind of realistic mods that try to model new vehicles that add kind of that realistic side of the game.

168
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:53,310
There's also completely new maps that people can create.

169
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,612
Mostly they're kind of dedicated to a specific area that they live in.

170
00:18:59,113 --> 00:19:03,135
Like here is one in the US, in Michigan.

171
00:19:04,135 --> 00:19:15,801
And also completely new gameplay features, like here where you have a very dedicated tool to fully optimize all the gameplay with very specific features.

172
00:19:17,788 --> 00:19:30,231
Some other stuff like police and search and rescue vehicles that kind of completely change the game away from farming.

173
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:36,712
Also some fun elements as well.

174
00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:46,054
They also added excavators in the game and some very fun stuff as well.

175
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:56,190
Also like yeah content very kind of dedicated to kids as well with like very colorful stuff.

176
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:18,153
So, well, how did we achieve that?

177
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:30,445
So with the first version of Farming Slater in 2008, we didn't really have time to implement a lot of modding specific features.

178
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:36,177
But we very focused on being as modding friendly as possible.

179
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:46,847
So we've chosen open formats, XML based and also used kind of industry standard formats like DDS for textures.

180
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:50,811
So the tools already exist to author them.

181
00:20:51,912 --> 00:21:05,722
And also we released our internal development tools like DCC exporters for our mesh formats and also our level designers that people could create new maps with primarily.

182
00:21:07,043 --> 00:21:11,206
And also we wrote most of the gameplay code in Lua.

183
00:21:11,506 --> 00:21:20,332
So that was fully accessible for the modders to change and adjust and also add new gameplay features.

184
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:31,062
Well with Farming Simulator 2009 we've had more time to actually improve that system.

185
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:44,166
So what we introduced was kind of a modular mod system where people or modders would put their mods into a zip file and people would simply put them in a known folder.

186
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:51,792
So they no longer have to change the game installation and kind of manually merge different mods and whatever.

187
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:56,457
So that made it very much simpler for the users.

188
00:21:58,055 --> 00:22:04,818
And also, the maps are now automatically detected and shown in the selection.

189
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:11,441
And the vehicles and equipment would be shown in the in-game farming shop.

190
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:18,425
So you can just buy them directly with no actual manual adjustments.

191
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:23,467
But we also restricted the access to the Lua scripts.

192
00:22:25,068 --> 00:22:26,148
The reason for that was

193
00:22:27,785 --> 00:22:35,952
With the previous open concept, it was very, very hard to have multiple mobs installed side by side.

194
00:22:36,632 --> 00:22:40,615
People would have had to kind of manually merge those Lua scripts.

195
00:22:41,596 --> 00:22:51,984
And so what we instead did is kind of provide a couple dedicated APIs to the modders that they can use to extend and change

196
00:22:52,865 --> 00:22:59,270
the script, so to hopefully reduce those conflicts between the mods.

197
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:19,567
With Farming Simulator 2011, we introduced multiplayer in the game, which I'm coming to in a second as well, but it also meant that we wanted to add mod support in multiplayer as well.

198
00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:35,250
So one key aspect for us was to make sure that the matchmaking is not compromised by the mods so other players couldn't destroy the experience of others.

199
00:23:36,306 --> 00:23:45,473
So what we made sure is that the clients need to have installed the same mods as the ones on the server.

200
00:23:46,193 --> 00:23:51,397
And also, the mods would only be activated when you would join a game.

201
00:23:51,837 --> 00:23:57,141
So only at that point, when the server already said, OK, I'm using those mods.

202
00:23:57,201 --> 00:23:59,023
I'm sure those are fine for me.

203
00:23:59,203 --> 00:24:01,945
That's also when the clients would actually activate them.

204
00:24:04,329 --> 00:24:21,609
And of course it also meant that all the mods had to be multiplayer aware, especially the script code that introduced new states had to be adjusted so the states is properly synced to multiplayer as well.

205
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:31,557
One big issue we kind of always faced so far at that point was the mod distribution.

206
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:40,926
So by then we didn't have any solution on our side so we left that up to the modders to distribute those mods.

207
00:24:41,587 --> 00:24:55,893
to the players and that often resulted in kind of very un-user friendly download sites kind of covered with ads and where you can barely see where you actually need to click to download.

208
00:24:57,994 --> 00:25:01,196
There's also been fake download sites that

209
00:25:02,145 --> 00:25:03,647
distributed malware and stuff.

210
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:22,308
And also one big issue was that people started to download other people's modders mods and re-uploaded them to a different site so they could earn a bit of money and that was always a big issue in the community.

211
00:25:23,872 --> 00:25:30,978
And from the user perspective as well is of course the quality insurance that wasn't guaranteed at all, right?

212
00:25:31,018 --> 00:25:37,783
So you would download the mod and you have no idea if it's even going to work or completely destroy your save game.

213
00:25:39,364 --> 00:25:45,267
So the solution we came up was the official mod hop that we introduced in 2012.

214
00:25:47,949 --> 00:25:57,234
So the idea about that was to really kind of have one source of quality mods.

215
00:25:57,714 --> 00:26:03,757
But modders were still hesitant to actually use that system because

216
00:26:05,373 --> 00:26:12,895
To kind of guarantee the quality, we had to introduce a couple restrictions in terms of quality.

217
00:26:13,975 --> 00:26:24,798
And also, because it's kind of an official thing from our side, we also had to guarantee that there's no licensing issues, there's no age restriction issues, etc.

218
00:26:24,858 --> 00:26:30,460
So, not all mods are actually possible to be submitted to the modhub.

219
00:26:31,545 --> 00:26:38,230
And also one big factor was the potential loss of that ant revenue from others.

220
00:26:40,111 --> 00:26:50,979
So it wasn't really that much used, but we really have seen a big shift in farming simulator 17.

221
00:26:52,813 --> 00:26:55,454
mainly due to kind of three changes that we made.

222
00:26:55,755 --> 00:27:01,197
So the first is that we integrated the mod hub into the game directly.

223
00:27:01,397 --> 00:27:07,941
So before, people had to go to our website and download the mod there and install it manually.

224
00:27:08,901 --> 00:27:17,826
And with Farming Simulator 17, it is now directly possible to download from within the game with basically one button click.

225
00:27:19,969 --> 00:27:23,693
Also we introduced the rewards program.

226
00:27:24,013 --> 00:27:31,781
So we do pay the modders based on the popularity of their mods.

227
00:27:33,322 --> 00:27:38,828
So that's actually going to be a couple thousand bucks a month.

228
00:27:39,201 --> 00:28:06,513
for the most popular mods so there's even some teams that kind of work almost professionally for those mods now also kind of interesting now that with the talk from Wednesday that Unreal Epic also introduced that for their Fortnite Creators Mode kind of a similar concept so

229
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:19,622
And then the last thing was the mod support that we've been able to finally introduce to our PlayStation and Xbox versions.

230
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:22,345
We're kind of really proud to

231
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:43,127
to be one of the very first game to actually support that, but of course there's a couple technical restrictions as well on that, like there's no option to compile shaders on those platforms and also we're not allowed to ship custom scripts there.

232
00:28:45,686 --> 00:28:52,395
Also one big restriction is that all the content on those platforms need to be created.

233
00:28:52,675 --> 00:28:58,944
So the only option to actually get mods on the consoles is to go through the mod hub.

234
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:10,258
But it's also very important for us to kind of keep the external mod support on the platforms where it is kind of possible.

235
00:29:10,718 --> 00:29:17,024
Because yeah, there's still a ton of mods that will never go through the mod hop restrictions that we have.

236
00:29:18,567 --> 00:29:24,252
So to kind of show the progression on the success of the mod hub, there's a couple numbers.

237
00:29:24,332 --> 00:29:34,440
So with Farming Simulator 15, where we first introduced it, we kind of got around 300 mods with around 1 million downloads.

238
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:41,105
And with Farming Simulator 17, we reached about 2,000 mods with over 500 million downloads.

239
00:29:42,026 --> 00:29:44,568
And then with Farming Simulator 19,

240
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:51,947
now have around 6,000 mods with more than 1 billion downloads in total.

241
00:29:52,627 --> 00:30:00,071
And Farming Simulator 22, even though it's just out for about a year, already reached similar numbers to Farming Simulator 19 as well.

242
00:30:05,663 --> 00:30:14,868
Some other kind of considerations for the mod support is that it's very important to kind of keep the modding as simple as possible.

243
00:30:15,769 --> 00:30:22,353
So we spend a lot of time on documenting our systems and writing tutorials.

244
00:30:22,853 --> 00:30:30,418
We've also been able to partner with Wiley to produce a farming simulator for modding book.

245
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:48,854
Also, it's important to kind of keep the amount of changes from version to version as small as possible so people are not forced to kind of relearn everything every couple years.

246
00:30:49,694 --> 00:31:02,178
And also to kind of keep the amount of mods as large as possible because it's always a bit of a hassle for players to lose all their content when they switch to a new version.

247
00:31:03,138 --> 00:31:11,740
So for the changes that we had to make, we tried to kind of keep a fallback support for old mods still.

248
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:32,604
Or in the cases where that was not possible, we also wrote converted tools, like when we restructured some XML files or when we changed our binary formats, texture formats, et cetera, so that there's as little work needed by the modders as possible.

249
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:50,188
And of course having our own engine was also a very huge benefit for that because we're able to really plan the changes we're doing and also kind of time them perfectly with new releases.

250
00:31:50,248 --> 00:32:01,214
So especially when we're doing updates from one version within the game would be a very big issue if suddenly more formats would change as well.

251
00:32:03,942 --> 00:32:13,275
Also it's kind of very important to keep kind of avoid any kind of locked in third party solutions like

252
00:32:15,046 --> 00:32:18,247
you would go with a Steam-only solution or so.

253
00:32:18,867 --> 00:32:24,009
That would really prevent providing mod support on consoles.

254
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:43,517
And also, it's very important to have a very optimized QA and submission process in a mod hub, because we've now QA'd more than 6,000 mods within a year to ship them to the players.

255
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:50,045
Another thing we did to kind of

256
00:32:52,717 --> 00:33:21,844
enforce people to create more moths we uh... we had multiple mock audits and tests in the past as well so here is an example in twenty seventeen we we had uh... total price pool of fifty thousand moths uh... fifty thousand uh... euros so uh... with uh... couple nice uh... uh... cheap use and and also like the winner of the contest uh...

257
00:33:22,424 --> 00:33:32,530
would have the option to partner with us to create a paid commercial DLC so where they would get a share from that as well.

258
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:44,356
These mods are free so there's no direct revenue except for the reward but the DLCs that we sell obviously get an even better reward.

259
00:33:51,676 --> 00:33:55,698
Let's get to another topic, which is the multiplayer mode.

260
00:33:55,998 --> 00:34:05,062
So the first two versions were single player only, but we've seen a very big potential in multiplayer.

261
00:34:05,842 --> 00:34:11,764
So farming in real life is also a very big teamwork effort.

262
00:34:12,465 --> 00:34:17,967
There's even processes that are now possible to do on your own, like chopping

263
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:36,190
mice which is where you have like the chopper is not able to basically capture all the chaff so you need to have a tractor with a trailer next to you driving all the time where it can immediately unload that.

264
00:34:38,172 --> 00:34:46,038
Also we've seen a lot of requests from the community that really would have liked to see that in a game and

265
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:55,051
We've also seen a very big competitive advantage as well, because most of the simulation games at that time didn't have multiplayer.

266
00:34:57,032 --> 00:35:08,717
So with Farming Simulator 2011, we implemented a cooperative farming mode with up to eight players.

267
00:35:08,897 --> 00:35:14,660
So you would manage one farm together on one map.

268
00:35:16,212 --> 00:35:27,955
And we chose kind of a server client model where one of the players would host the game and others could join directly.

269
00:35:31,236 --> 00:35:34,557
Also, the mode was played mostly with rents.

270
00:35:34,737 --> 00:35:39,679
I mean, technically, it's also possible to just have random people playing together.

271
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:44,420
But yeah, with cooperative playing, it's always a bit tricky to have

272
00:35:45,796 --> 00:35:46,397
random people.

273
00:35:47,218 --> 00:35:57,133
So one other thing we introduced in 2013 was a dedicated server support.

274
00:35:58,211 --> 00:36:05,674
So with that self-hosted system, that has always been kind of an issue with network performance.

275
00:36:05,994 --> 00:36:10,476
And back then, like even one megabits of upload was kind of a luxury.

276
00:36:11,317 --> 00:36:16,019
So that was always a bit tricky for the player experience.

277
00:36:16,379 --> 00:36:23,202
So having a server in a data center obviously helped a lot for that.

278
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:29,331
But it also gave several kind of gameplay benefits as well.

279
00:36:29,612 --> 00:36:36,014
So now with a server running all the time, you could also have kind of a continuously simulated world.

280
00:36:36,855 --> 00:36:45,619
So you're no longer tied to one of the players hosting the game, and then it would only be running at that point.

281
00:36:46,992 --> 00:37:02,943
And also you could now have multiple admins for the game, because before only the host would be kind of the admin of the game and would have all the permissions to give rights to the players and kick and ban them.

282
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:11,890
And now, with the dedicated servers, you could have multiple of those, which also allowed kind of more public play as well.

283
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:22,539
So you could kind of create a bigger community of people that would just randomly play on one world and share kind of the same experience.

284
00:37:26,158 --> 00:37:36,522
With Farming Simulator 19 we also introduced a new concept of having multiple farms on one map.

285
00:37:36,903 --> 00:37:44,386
So you could have up to eight farms and each player would be assigned to one of those farms.

286
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:50,608
And each of those farms would own their own land, their own vehicles and

287
00:37:52,298 --> 00:37:55,505
would be kind of playing against the other farms.

288
00:37:56,166 --> 00:38:02,520
That kind of introduced also a more competitive play as well, because

289
00:38:04,364 --> 00:38:08,927
You kind of compete with those other farms for resources like land.

290
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:15,091
So you probably want to buy the best land first before the others can.

291
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:22,395
And also there's a concept of kind of variable sell prices for your crops.

292
00:38:23,316 --> 00:38:26,458
So the more you sell, the less you get for it.

293
00:38:26,578 --> 00:38:31,261
So you probably want to sell the stuff first before the other farm can.

294
00:38:35,512 --> 00:38:45,098
Also, cross-play is something we introduced with Farming Simulator 22 as one of the biggest features in multiplayer.

295
00:38:45,939 --> 00:38:51,523
So now you're no longer restricted to just play with people on the same platform.

296
00:38:53,404 --> 00:39:02,310
But that also had the restriction that we now had to provide the same mods on all platforms.

297
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:16,415
So before we've been able to just have a set of mods only on the consoles and maybe similar but slightly adjusted mods on PC because of the restrictions on consoles.

298
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:22,823
But now we're forced to really guarantee that the mods are really the same as much as possible.

299
00:39:26,266 --> 00:39:35,173
Also, it's kind of very important to not have any platform-specific APIs, like for networking or matchmaking.

300
00:39:37,455 --> 00:39:42,819
Also, before we only had voice chat on the console versions.

301
00:39:45,296 --> 00:39:58,727
Now with cross-play, for the console players to be able to really communicate with the PC players, it was also an important thing to actually introduce voice chat as a feature on PC as well.

302
00:40:01,843 --> 00:40:10,969
And also there's a kind of a restriction that we're not allowed to have any direct connections from the consoles to the PC.

303
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:18,615
So, but we still wanted to kind of keep that self-hosted concept.

304
00:40:18,755 --> 00:40:20,956
So we didn't want to force everyone to

305
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:25,341
to go through the dedicated server concept.

306
00:40:26,242 --> 00:40:31,948
So what we did is we introduced a relay server concept.

307
00:40:32,628 --> 00:40:43,520
So instead of connecting directly from PC to consoles, we would connect, both would connect to that relay server and all the traffic would be routed through those.

308
00:40:49,260 --> 00:41:02,763
Another part that is kind of tied to the multiplayer mode, but it is not directly part of the game, is our eSports mode.

309
00:41:02,943 --> 00:41:10,745
So 2017 we kind of experimented with some competitive modes.

310
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:21,311
And we've seen a very huge advantage in that because most of the big eSport titles are not family friendly.

311
00:41:21,971 --> 00:41:25,595
So we've seen kind of a big potential in that.

312
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:31,842
And also the feedback we got from those early experiments were very positive, that kind of

313
00:41:32,659 --> 00:41:39,004
encouraged us to continue with that and develop a full-featured eSports mode.

314
00:41:40,685 --> 00:41:49,011
So in 2019, we had our first Farming Simulator League season with a prize pool of over $250,000.

315
00:41:50,332 --> 00:41:59,899
And so I've got a short video to show a couple of impressions of how that looks.

316
00:42:08,749 --> 00:42:13,571
So yeah, we also work together with the big manufacturer brands.

317
00:42:14,371 --> 00:42:19,233
So they have their own teams that compete in the league.

318
00:42:20,894 --> 00:42:24,656
And the mode is kind of a three by three mode.

319
00:42:25,819 --> 00:42:38,845
which is covering kind of the three concepts of harvesting, baling, and then selling those bales, kind of as efficiently as possible.

320
00:43:31,768 --> 00:43:35,392
So that brings us to the conclusion of the talk.

321
00:43:37,273 --> 00:43:41,477
The franchise has evolved quite a lot over the years.

322
00:43:42,779 --> 00:43:46,162
Our basic strategy hasn't really changed.

323
00:43:47,895 --> 00:44:04,169
we're still trying to kind of be as casual as possible but kind of give a kind of still give kind of a realistic simulation and also like the modding helps as well to kind of

324
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:14,872
solve the balancing act as well because there's a lot of very realistic farming mods out there.

325
00:44:15,192 --> 00:44:24,675
So the core simulation fans can also work with those mods and kind of get their very realistic experience if they like to.

326
00:44:26,276 --> 00:44:34,278
And also the listening to the community feedback helped us a lot to improve the game over the years as well.

327
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:42,511
But it's also very important to know that not all of the feedback is really good feedback as well.

328
00:44:43,412 --> 00:44:48,435
And also a lot of the feedback you hear is coming only kind of a portion of

329
00:44:49,355 --> 00:45:02,067
of the game, of the players, especially like more kind of the core simulation audience is kind of more audible in that feedback than the casual players.

330
00:45:02,788 --> 00:45:13,978
So we also implemented features into the game where we later realized that it's actually not really a feedback that kind of the casual player liked.

331
00:45:14,835 --> 00:45:21,737
So later on in updates of the game, we also added options kind of to disable those features again.

332
00:45:23,558 --> 00:45:28,040
So that it works better with the play style of those more casual players.

333
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:36,963
For the future, we have a lot of ideas that we want to

334
00:45:37,981 --> 00:45:43,543
want to do, but there's like a couple key points I want to mention here.

335
00:45:44,364 --> 00:46:01,851
Like the immersion that we want to achieve is not where we would like it to see yet, so we would definitely see more interactive worlds and also kind of see more story elements with NPCs and stuff to interact with.

336
00:46:02,912 --> 00:46:12,520
And also the eSports mode right now is still kind of separate from the game and it kind of limits the amount of players that actually use it.

337
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:19,585
And that's definitely something we would love to see more integrated into the game to get a bigger audience.

338
00:46:20,626 --> 00:46:28,533
And also one thing that is always tricky with War Thinks Simulator is the onboarding and also kind of the

339
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:35,592
The open world style of the game kind of doesn't give a lot of guidance to the players.

340
00:46:35,972 --> 00:46:42,994
So people are often kind of left in a situation where they don't know what they should do next.

341
00:46:43,714 --> 00:46:49,095
Because yeah, it's an open world game, sandbox style, where you can do whatever you want.

342
00:46:51,357 --> 00:46:57,101
It would definitely be beneficial to those to kind of give some guidance what they could maybe try next.

343
00:46:58,581 --> 00:47:02,524
So that fits better to some of those players.

344
00:47:05,726 --> 00:47:07,687
So yeah, that's Farming Slater.

345
00:47:09,648 --> 00:47:11,809
Thank you for your attendance.

346
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:17,893
And don't forget to fill out the review forms.

347
00:47:18,513 --> 00:47:21,015
And yeah, we're open for questions.

348
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,521
Hi, I'm Frank Carey from Fable Studio.

349
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:34,062
We're working on an AI theme park builder game.

350
00:47:35,042 --> 00:47:39,504
And since I saw this title, I've always been curious, like, why farming, right?

351
00:47:39,705 --> 00:47:41,585
Like, what is it about farming?

352
00:47:42,346 --> 00:47:45,007
What other options did you guys consider at the time?

353
00:47:46,688 --> 00:47:51,890
And yeah, what was farming checking the boxes of that maybe those other options didn't?

354
00:47:53,991 --> 00:47:58,853
Well, I mean, before Farming Simulator, we actually worked more on like an RPG title.

355
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:08,946
But kind of what convinced us about farming was kind of the broad array of activities you can do in farming.

356
00:48:09,246 --> 00:48:16,432
There's so many things that you can do and gives us the option to kind of really create a big game.

357
00:48:18,714 --> 00:48:19,214
Quick follow-up.

358
00:48:19,474 --> 00:48:21,916
Is there a demographic that seems to like the game?

359
00:48:21,956 --> 00:48:26,100
Is it more rural folks that enjoy it or is it you don't see that?

360
00:48:27,844 --> 00:48:29,844
Well, not really.

361
00:48:30,025 --> 00:48:40,767
If you compare it to flight simulators or truck simulators or whatever, kids also like those topics as well.

362
00:48:40,807 --> 00:48:43,108
So that's not very specific to farming.

363
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:54,971
But I think one big part of the success is also how we kind of tackled the simulation genre and kind of tried to give those casual elements as well.

364
00:48:56,511 --> 00:48:56,751
Thank you.

365
00:48:59,835 --> 00:49:01,215
I enjoyed the talk a great deal.

366
00:49:02,096 --> 00:49:11,841
I was actually surprised in the beginning to hear that one of your main design pillars was entertainment over accuracy, because I usually think of Farming Simulator as a simulator.

367
00:49:11,921 --> 00:49:13,321
It's not a Harvest Moon.

368
00:49:13,361 --> 00:49:20,425
It's very much a simulation game in terms of its branding compared to other titles on the shelf at a GameStop or something like that.

369
00:49:20,945 --> 00:49:25,768
So I'm wondering, given that entertainment over realism is one of your pillars,

370
00:49:26,468 --> 00:49:39,676
How has Farming Simulator maintained its identity over these years and not branched into things like, say, having players fall from a flying school bus or zombies walking through your farm?

371
00:49:39,996 --> 00:49:45,520
How have you maintained that focus while also prioritizing entertainment?

372
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:54,285
Well, I mean, kind of the realism is kind of still kind of the core concept, right?

373
00:49:54,305 --> 00:49:59,848
So basically, what we do is we look at reality and try to

374
00:50:00,788 --> 00:50:00,868
I'm

375
00:50:22,078 --> 00:50:23,240
to still be fun, right?

376
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:30,867
It's not the other way around where we say, well, maybe that could be a cool thing that's completely unrealistic and let's build that in, right?

377
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:34,691
It's still coming from the realistic side.

378
00:50:39,298 --> 00:50:40,338
Hey, OK.

379
00:50:40,558 --> 00:50:42,139
Thank you so much for the talk to start with.

380
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:44,040
It was super insightful in so many ways.

381
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:50,342
I had a question about when you actually started right at the beginning, how did you build up the knowledge base?

382
00:50:50,482 --> 00:50:54,723
I mean, coming up with a farming simulator, there must be so much knowledge that you need to gather.

383
00:50:54,983 --> 00:50:57,064
And then, of course, you keep talking about the entertainment.

384
00:50:57,424 --> 00:51:00,085
So there's the vulgarization of all of that and make it digestible.

385
00:51:00,745 --> 00:51:05,067
I'm quite intrigued on how you approached it and if you had any background in farming before.

386
00:51:06,516 --> 00:51:08,878
Well, I mean, it was really tricky, definitely.

387
00:51:09,759 --> 00:51:16,986
I mean, we kind of both kind of grew up on the countryside, so farming was not completely foreign to us.

388
00:51:18,388 --> 00:51:23,192
But, yeah, most of the knowledge in the beginning came from the community.

389
00:51:23,352 --> 00:51:27,496
So we had a forum from the very beginning where we had a lot of feedback as well.

390
00:51:28,457 --> 00:51:45,821
and also a lot of like wikipedia etc so to really figure out how stuff is done but uh but later on we also hired several people that actually have a farming background as well that that could help on that side that makes sense thanks a lot

391
00:51:47,898 --> 00:51:48,618
Thank you for the talk.

392
00:51:49,518 --> 00:52:13,423
In terms of your community feedback and also your future, what's the, can you speak to the work you're doing to understand their buying habits, their retention year to year, because it's a yearly, an annual product you have, is there a demand to go to more of a true perennial and evergreen gas where you just have a core product and you support it on DLC only?

393
00:52:16,171 --> 00:52:21,037
So the question is how kind of the update style of the game is, right?

394
00:52:21,357 --> 00:52:32,389
Yeah, like what's the demand there from your user base in terms of, like, are they happy with the yearly model or is there a growing... Yeah, so with...

395
00:52:34,059 --> 00:52:48,468
We always hear feedback from people that they would like to see a model where we kind of keep the same game and just continuously update it, which kind of would help for the modding to some degree.

396
00:52:49,389 --> 00:52:53,090
But it's also kind of the modding that kind of prevents it as well.

397
00:52:53,711 --> 00:53:07,716
Because if we would just continuously update, eventually we need to introduce new features like, for example, with Farming Simulator 15 or so, we switched from old school textures to BBR textures.

398
00:53:09,076 --> 00:53:14,079
And that switch would have been a big issue if it was within the same version, right?

399
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:35,231
So suddenly there's not really a clearly new version but every mod would be broken and kind of having that new version cycle also helps to kind of clearly dictate, okay, until that point the mods are mostly compatible but at that point now you need to make sure that the mods are compatible again.

400
00:53:43,238 --> 00:53:50,164
Hi, I'm the release engineer for Sony platforms at Jackbox Games and I'm very curious as to how you approach your modding.

401
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,520
I guess your strategy.

402
00:53:55,060 --> 00:54:02,482
The one thing about TRC, like the TRC is for Sony is that UGC has to be created on the platform, on a Sony platform specifically.

403
00:54:02,942 --> 00:54:12,504
So I'm curious as to how you guys solved that problem where mods that were developed on a Steam or a different console were also being played on a Sony platform.

404
00:54:12,584 --> 00:54:16,125
I run into this issue constantly which is why I'm so curious as to how you guys solved this.

405
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:31,260
Yeah, so the question is how we would kind of solve the TRC issues on the Sony platform for the UGC, that it would have to be created on a platform, not externally.

406
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:38,466
So yeah, actually that was a big discussion we've had with Microsoft and Sony for a long time.

407
00:54:41,713 --> 00:54:51,785
We've been able to kind of convince them with Pharmacylometer 17 that we're actually allowed to do the way we're doing it right now.

408
00:54:52,554 --> 00:55:01,558
And I think a lot of that also probably helped that Skyrim was working on a similar concept at the same time.

409
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:08,021
But yeah, that's why we have those limitations as well.

410
00:55:08,081 --> 00:55:15,464
So all the content that goes on the consoles is going to be created on our side.

411
00:55:16,124 --> 00:55:21,769
and there's no options for players just to freely install content from anywhere.

412
00:55:22,349 --> 00:55:24,711
That doesn't go through the mod hop.

413
00:55:25,812 --> 00:55:26,472
Okay, gotcha.

414
00:55:26,512 --> 00:55:26,813
Thank you.

415
00:55:33,878 --> 00:55:35,559
Yeah, so thank you.
