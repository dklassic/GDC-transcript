1
00:00:06,659 --> 00:00:11,041
I'm talking today about crowdsourcing the localization of Gone Home.

2
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:19,204
So in case you haven't played it, I'll give you some context for what Gone Home is.

3
00:00:19,224 --> 00:00:22,265
It's a first person narrative exploration game.

4
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:29,928
The player wanders through a static environment, you know, just examining things, reading content.

5
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:33,589
There's no puzzles, no combat, no NPCs, anything like that.

6
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:39,649
It's all about discovering a story that's kind of encoded in the environment.

7
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:45,833
And the main storyline is delivered through these Bioshock-style audio diaries.

8
00:00:46,214 --> 00:00:53,619
That is, the player picks up certain objects and audio plays over the speakers,

9
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,902
explaining somewhat what's going on, moving the story forward.

10
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:11,397
So what exactly was I thinking about, or were we thinking about when we were considering whether to localize our game at all?

11
00:01:12,618 --> 00:01:16,921
Well, first thing is that I was a UI programmer on Bioshock 2 and...

12
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:23,242
To be honest, on that game localization turned out to kind of be a mess.

13
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:28,604
It kind of happened at the very last minute and caused a lot of problems for a lot of people,

14
00:01:29,325 --> 00:01:31,505
largely me because I was the UI programmer.

15
00:01:32,906 --> 00:01:35,747
So what I learned from that is if you're going to localize a game,

16
00:01:36,427 --> 00:01:38,608
you have to do it right and you have to do it early.

17
00:01:38,628 --> 00:01:40,249
That's key.

18
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:46,511
Another thing we had to consider, Gone Home is a narrative heavy indie game.

19
00:01:47,102 --> 00:01:54,966
So what does that mean? First, narrative-heavy means that if your primary language is not English

20
00:01:55,206 --> 00:02:02,949
and you can't really understand this English narrative, you're not going to get much out of

21
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,670
the game. In fact, there's nothing else to the game than the story, so if you can't understand

22
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,971
the story, you probably shouldn't buy the game.

23
00:02:10,442 --> 00:02:16,243
And it's an indie game, which means that we have a fairly limited audience to start with.

24
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:24,865
And the more we can expand that audience to speakers of different languages and so forth, the better.

25
00:02:26,225 --> 00:02:28,566
So, you know, that's good.

26
00:02:29,906 --> 00:02:36,507
And then the other thing we were considering is that we wanted to have as accessible of a game as possible.

27
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:39,008
It turns out that a lot of the...

28
00:02:39,844 --> 00:02:43,825
things that one does to create an atmosphere for localization

29
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:47,966
also help accessibility. Things like subtitles and

30
00:02:48,446 --> 00:02:51,227
easier readable text overlays and things like that

31
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:54,727
so we would kind of be killing two birds with one stone

32
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:59,649
by supporting some of those things. But there's

33
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,790
was a little bit of a problem. Gone Home's budget

34
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,110
there really wasn't one. There were

35
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:12,921
Three of us who quit our jobs and moved into a house in Portland, we lived together in

36
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:15,422
this house and tried to make a game in the basement.

37
00:03:16,883 --> 00:03:20,464
Everything we spent came out of our personal savings.

38
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:27,107
It was the same wallet that we were using for our rent and our groceries and things

39
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:27,528
like that.

40
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:34,051
So as a result of that, we were highly motivated to do this cheaply.

41
00:03:34,792 --> 00:03:37,893
We didn't want to spend our personal funds on anything we didn't have to.

42
00:03:39,774 --> 00:03:50,997
So, to kind of continue along that, or further that point, Gone Home's content, there was a lot of it.

43
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:58,079
Again, it's a narrative-heavy game, right? So there's a ton of text, both important story-critical text,

44
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:01,680
and then just flavor text to kind of give the world a little bit more depth.

45
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:09,988
All of this text, most of this text, except for the UI stuff, is baked into textures and placed on objects in the world.

46
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:16,733
So it's not something that can be dynamically manipulated easily. It's, you know, in these things.

47
00:04:18,394 --> 00:04:28,280
And again, there's a lot of audio that is very well voice acted by professional voice actresses.

48
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:28,621
So...

49
00:04:32,684 --> 00:04:53,894
There was a lot of content. Here are some numbers. These are just very rough numbers because all I did was use a program to kind of do a count of words so it's not accurate at all but it gives you some idea of the amount of scope we're talking about. I did some research and contacted some localization firms and one

50
00:04:56,024 --> 00:05:02,466
seemingly middle-of-the-road quote that I got was something like 20 cents a word a language for

51
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:03,826
localizing a game

52
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:05,806
So at that rate

53
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:13,668
Localizing our game would pay our rent for over three years. So that was obviously not an option

54
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:16,889
We did we did want to localize the game

55
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:19,470
But we didn't want to pay for it

56
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,230
so

57
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,111
How do we how do we do this?

58
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:29,579
Well, we decided to do crowdsourced localization.

59
00:05:29,619 --> 00:05:33,422
We wanted our users to localize the game for us.

60
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:38,085
We would put out the game and have people translate it

61
00:05:38,165 --> 00:05:39,586
into all their different languages.

62
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:45,309
And so the next question to ask is, well, what do we localize,

63
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:46,730
given that we're doing crowdsourcing?

64
00:05:47,731 --> 00:05:52,334
Well, again, we had these amazing professional voice

65
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,736
actresses who did the voice work for us.

66
00:05:56,196 --> 00:06:03,878
And also we used Unity which packages up audio files into like a big binary file that goes

67
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:09,680
in your game and it's really hard to actually extract or replace audio files from this giant

68
00:06:10,381 --> 00:06:11,601
package of binary stuff.

69
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:14,982
And so we decided to do text only localization.

70
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:16,743
It's also just a lot simpler to do.

71
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:26,044
We wanted to use subtitles for all the audio content, for the baked in text on textures and objects and things.

72
00:06:26,624 --> 00:06:34,730
We decided to do an overlay over those and UI text, which is possible to change dynamically, we just would swap out.

73
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,253
So I'm going to show you some examples of what I'm talking about here.

74
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:45,577
So this is an example of some important and unimportant or flavor.

75
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:48,480
In this case, maybe artificially flavored text.

76
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:52,924
It's indistinguishable, maybe, at first.

77
00:06:53,244 --> 00:06:56,407
They both look like just kind of tables of figures or whatever.

78
00:06:56,467 --> 00:06:58,929
But the one on the left helps the player

79
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:04,414
to understand that this family has recently

80
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:05,515
moved into this house.

81
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:06,996
The one on the right just kind of

82
00:07:07,476 --> 00:07:09,878
helps to provide a realistic world where

83
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:11,840
soda has ingredients in it.

84
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:18,733
This is an example of the text overlay.

85
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:21,733
So this is the same moving invoice from the previous slide,

86
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:26,175
except it's been, you know, it's got some transparency on it

87
00:07:26,715 --> 00:07:28,516
so that it's, you can still see

88
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:30,076
what exactly you're reading,

89
00:07:30,236 --> 00:07:32,397
but it's no longer the main visual element.

90
00:07:32,437 --> 00:07:33,637
And then overlaid on top of that,

91
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:36,098
there's much more readable text.

92
00:07:36,518 --> 00:07:37,318
It happens to be in English,

93
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:38,859
but it could be, you know, anything,

94
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,159
because it's dynamically swappable.

95
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:50,312
Here's another example of text overlay. This is a book entitled Making Friends Even When You're Shy

96
00:07:50,593 --> 00:07:56,158
and it's got a post-it note on it that says, Sam thought this might help, signed Dad.

97
00:07:57,118 --> 00:08:03,644
So the player from this is supposed to understand that Sam is maybe having some trouble making friends

98
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:09,449
and that Dad is trying to help but he's not very good at it. So, poor Dad, poor Sam.

99
00:08:10,634 --> 00:08:16,117
But you can see how text overlay works here with 3D objects and baked in text.

100
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:23,482
And then, you know, subtitles are just like subtitles in any other medium, basically.

101
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:24,603
Right there.

102
00:08:27,705 --> 00:08:32,829
So, yeah, given we wanted to crowdsource our localization system,

103
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:37,111
how do you design a localization system with that in mind?

104
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:44,973
First things are, it needs to be easy for Steve and Carla who actually wrote all the text in the game to edit it,

105
00:08:44,993 --> 00:08:49,535
because they're going to be writing a lot of text and editing these files all the time and things like that.

106
00:08:49,556 --> 00:08:54,698
It needs to be easy to translate for fans who actually want to do that.

107
00:08:55,078 --> 00:09:02,442
It should be really obvious what sentences need to change into what different ones and where to place these various things.

108
00:09:03,592 --> 00:09:15,880
It should also be easy to use for non-technical players, that is, you know, you shouldn't need to do complicated things with your computer or download weird obscure software and learn to use it or anything like that.

109
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:28,147
So the fairly obvious solution for this is that everything is in just plain text files that are at a particular location in the file structure of the operating system.

110
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,193
XML for subtitle data since it has timing information in it,

111
00:09:34,493 --> 00:09:37,877
but also it's really simple XML layout basically,

112
00:09:37,937 --> 00:09:40,740
so very easy for even non-technical people

113
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,941
to edit all of this data.

114
00:09:45,444 --> 00:09:47,166
The other interesting thing,

115
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:50,269
if you're crowdsourcing your localization, is that...

116
00:09:51,861 --> 00:10:20,042
You never have a full translation of your game that you can play, and so you have to somehow test this without ever actually using it, which is kind of the worst thing to be faced with as a software developer, right? The only way to test something is to actually use it. So, in order to get around this problem a little bit, I wrote some scripts to generate, you know, localized, fake localized content.

117
00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:24,207
One just took English strings and reversed them.

118
00:10:24,788 --> 00:10:30,351
That's really nice because you can still basically read what everything is supposed to be

119
00:10:30,492 --> 00:10:32,193
and navigate the game and everything like that.

120
00:10:33,914 --> 00:10:35,635
It's also really simple, obviously, to do.

121
00:10:36,656 --> 00:10:41,359
Another one is lorem ipsum, where you just replace every string with an equivalent amount of

122
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,283
lorem ipsum text, which makes the game impossible to play because everything just says lorem

123
00:10:47,303 --> 00:10:47,823
ipsum everywhere.

124
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:56,335
string and everything. It's also really obvious with both of these when they've been translated

125
00:10:56,395 --> 00:11:01,117
so you can tell very easily if something is being missed by the system or whatever. And

126
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:07,000
then the last one that I wrote but we didn't actually end up using, use the Google Translate

127
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:14,123
API to just automatically translate strings from one, from English to whatever language and

128
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:22,038
put those in. Obviously that would be kind of the ideal solution because everything will end up being approximately the correct length

129
00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:26,402
and it'll use all the special characters that you might find in that language.

130
00:11:27,302 --> 00:11:31,346
It does cost a little bit of money though to use the Google Translate API, not a whole lot.

131
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:37,871
I did some calculations and I figured out that we could translate our whole game for something like

132
00:11:37,911 --> 00:11:42,655
20 to 25 bucks per language or something like that, which isn't bad, but we didn't end up using it anyway.

133
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:51,325
Another thing we did was had lots and lots of warnings in the system whenever content

134
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:58,848
was not found so that we hopefully would know right away when something was broken or missing.

135
00:12:00,682 --> 00:12:14,709
And the last thing is we localize the game to English as the default, which means that when you're playing the game, it's running through all of the stuff it would do normally to localize the game, except it's just doing it into English.

136
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:23,853
So if the localization system ever entirely breaks down, or if there's entirely missing content, you see this because it doesn't work, basically. You don't get to play the game.

137
00:12:27,783 --> 00:12:39,428
Big thing to remember about crowdsourcing is you've got a bunch of people doing a lot of work for you and they're not getting paid anything.

138
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:47,051
They're helping you out a whole bunch and so you need to help them to help you.

139
00:12:49,572 --> 00:12:57,136
What we did is we made a lot of documentation about this process and how to use it.

140
00:12:58,161 --> 00:13:01,782
We published this on our website as well as packaging it with every copy of the game.

141
00:13:03,643 --> 00:13:05,923
We tried to make the process as painless as possible.

142
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:09,585
Again, you don't need to download any weird software or anything like that.

143
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:12,505
All you need to do is go in and edit these plain text files.

144
00:13:13,686 --> 00:13:15,506
It should be really easy to do.

145
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:24,509
Because we didn't do, again, we never had a fully localized version of the game,

146
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,752
We knew that people were going to find bugs, and they did.

147
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:33,196
And it's really important to respond to those really quickly.

148
00:13:33,656 --> 00:13:37,039
We actually patched the game a few days after shipping it

149
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:41,183
because there were some pretty bad localization bugs.

150
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:47,068
Another thing that will happen is, you know, your translators will...

151
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:54,114
probably need clarification on the text in the game, especially Gone Home is set in the 90s

152
00:13:54,174 --> 00:14:01,298
and is told primarily from the perspective of a teenage girl, so there's a lot of idiom in the game text

153
00:14:01,478 --> 00:14:06,381
and so a lot of that needs clarification as to like, well, what exactly does this mean?

154
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:16,356
Again, no one's getting paid for translating your game, so the only thing they get is their name in lights.

155
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:19,597
So you should make those lights as bright as possible.

156
00:14:20,898 --> 00:14:23,760
Lots and lots of credit in whatever form people desire.

157
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:31,123
So I have here the URL for this localization-specific page that we set up for the game.

158
00:14:33,064 --> 00:14:36,126
On this page we have, again, the documentation.

159
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:37,707
We have...

160
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,586
basically where people can ask questions and get responses and see

161
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:47,089
you know these clarifications and responses from other users

162
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:51,192
and we also, that's where we put everyone's

163
00:14:52,153 --> 00:14:55,536
names for crediting with a link to the

164
00:14:56,077 --> 00:14:58,739
actual translation package that they produced

165
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:03,243
so that's kind of the one stop shop for all of this stuff

166
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:06,265
So, um

167
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:12,764
Yeah, we went ahead and we did this. We crowdsourced our localization.

168
00:15:13,824 --> 00:15:22,950
How did that go? Well, what went right was we have been localized into more than 12 languages for free.

169
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:29,593
That's really awesome. We have a really enthusiastic community doing this stuff for us.

170
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:30,794
They're super engaged.

171
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:38,933
The Japanese translators have had, I think, like two interviews in Famitsu so far.

172
00:15:39,853 --> 00:15:50,677
Awesome. That's cool. Which is kind of bizarre because I don't think any of the actual dev team has been interviewed in Famitsu about the game.

173
00:15:50,837 --> 00:15:53,558
So, you know, awesome. More power to you.

174
00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:08,165
It was easy to add additional content to the game. I think I mentioned before that we added a commentary mode a few weeks after the game shipped that was a huge amount of content.

175
00:16:08,545 --> 00:16:16,389
And it went kind of painlessly into the game. It didn't break any existing translations. It just added a whole bunch more stuff without any problems.

176
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:21,412
And the other thing is that popular languages will get supported.

177
00:16:21,592 --> 00:16:25,314
So, you know, before you ship a game, for all you know...

178
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:32,167
I don't know, no one's going to play it in Germany, or maybe, you know, it's really popular

179
00:16:32,207 --> 00:16:33,588
in Turkey or something like that.

180
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:34,368
Like who knows?

181
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:39,111
You know, if you have to pick all your languages that you're going to localize to before you

182
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:45,915
ship, you may not be able to target the right areas, whereas crowdsourcing means that you'll

183
00:16:45,935 --> 00:16:47,997
get the languages that people are actually playing in.

184
00:16:49,084 --> 00:16:58,309
Except actually someone did an Esperanto translation of Gone Home, and I don't think there are that many actual Esperanto players, probably. Maybe, I don't know.

185
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:05,092
The flip side of this, of course, is what didn't go so well with this.

186
00:17:06,473 --> 00:17:15,757
One thing is that the main thing we used for the translations is a very simple dictionary structure,

187
00:17:15,777 --> 00:17:16,277
so the English...

188
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:21,686
Sentence is the key and the translated sentence is the value.

189
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:26,688
Basically this means that if the original sentence changes,

190
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:28,989
even in the most minor way, like fixing a typo

191
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,850
or changing punctuation or anything like that,

192
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,311
that entirely invalidates the translation.

193
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:37,053
And so that's obviously not ideal.

194
00:17:37,293 --> 00:17:41,234
It would be much better to have a unique identifier system

195
00:17:42,455 --> 00:17:45,676
so that you wouldn't lose the translation when it changed.

196
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:53,875
We really screwed up the fonts. One of the things we had to ship with a patch right afterwards

197
00:17:54,376 --> 00:18:01,319
was fixing some of the fonts for other character sets because they were just way too big for

198
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:08,243
actual people to use. And then, you know, I mentioned all the stuff we did to test. It was

199
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:12,405
not nearly enough. We missed the font thing, for example. There was a lot of other stuff

200
00:18:12,445 --> 00:18:15,707
going on with four people as the core team.

201
00:18:16,724 --> 00:18:18,605
and a couple other testers helping us out.

202
00:18:19,066 --> 00:18:22,048
We just did not have enough people or enough time

203
00:18:22,248 --> 00:18:24,911
or honestly put enough attention on testing

204
00:18:24,931 --> 00:18:27,033
the localization stuff.

205
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:32,077
And then we basically intentionally, entirely

206
00:18:32,137 --> 00:18:36,601
ignored any sort of problem solving for UI spacing.

207
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:39,723
So if strings were longer than could fit in the UI

208
00:18:39,763 --> 00:18:41,705
when they're translated, then I guess

209
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:43,927
you need to change your translation.

210
00:18:44,227 --> 00:18:44,507
Sorry.

211
00:18:45,673 --> 00:18:46,753
That was the best we could do.

212
00:18:50,415 --> 00:18:54,596
But there are, oh yeah, and then the biggest thing that went wrong is even though we shipped

213
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:59,138
a Klingon font set with the game, no one has yet done a Klingon translation of Gone Home.

214
00:18:59,478 --> 00:19:00,639
It's really tragic.

215
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:08,181
But there are some more caveats for doing crowdsourced localization in general.

216
00:19:09,602 --> 00:19:13,724
First one is that even though all of the actual translation is being done by...

217
00:19:15,492 --> 00:19:22,559
other people for free. Supporting localization in general as like a system is a gigantic task that

218
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:28,304
touches pretty much every discipline that works on a game and it will take hours and hours of

219
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:33,789
everyone's life more time than you think it will. Especially if you really want to do testing well

220
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:41,456
it will take lots and lots of hours of this. This is one thing if you actually pay for localization.

221
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:47,830
Excuse me, obviously you not only get people translating this stuff, but you get very good

222
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:53,771
qualified testers to go through and verify that all of this stuff works really well.

223
00:19:55,892 --> 00:20:00,993
The other thing is that crowdsourcing your localization means that when you launch your

224
00:20:01,013 --> 00:20:06,615
game you do not actually have any support for other languages, so you can't check the

225
00:20:06,635 --> 00:20:10,696
little box in Steam that says this game speaks German or whatever.

226
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:31,151
And you know what? Maybe you can never do that. If your game just isn't popular enough with certain languages, or people just don't feel like doing the work for you, or whatever happens, maybe you will put all this work into a localization system and no one will ever translate your game. That would obviously be heartbreaking, right?

227
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:43,004
So yeah, I also have, this is a slide, I don't have a whole lot to say about it, but these are the languages that Gone Home has been translated into so far.

228
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:50,809
Japanese is actually still a work in progress, but this is kind of really impressive. There's some very surprising things up there.

229
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:59,073
I wouldn't have picked Czech for a language that people would want to play our game in, or Turkish, you know, but hey, this is amazing.

230
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:02,895
I'm really, really gratified that the community has...

231
00:21:04,821 --> 00:21:16,528
our game to this degree. I'm really happy about it. And yeah, I don't know that we have time for

232
00:21:16,568 --> 00:21:22,792
too many questions right now, but if you want to get in touch with me, here's how you can do it.

233
00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:29,536
That's my email, my Twitter handle and the URL for our game. And thanks a lot for coming.

234
00:21:42,271 --> 00:21:45,314
I think we have a couple of minutes for questions.

235
00:21:45,334 --> 00:21:50,319
Probably we have a couple of hundred questions for you, but we can accommodate at least one.

236
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,140
Sure.

237
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:55,865
Hi. What avenues did you use to build your community?

238
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:59,128
How did you get the message out to have people come?

239
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:01,651
That's a really good question, actually.

240
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:10,635
Everyone on the development team for Gone Home is really severely addicted to Twitter,

241
00:22:11,236 --> 00:22:16,179
and that has been kind of our prime means of community building for the game in general.

242
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:20,341
And so, we had a number of things.

243
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:26,165
First of all, right before we shipped the game and the localization system was in place

244
00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:28,006
with, you know, how it would work and everything like that,

245
00:22:28,827 --> 00:22:31,449
I made a big blog post detailing exactly how...

246
00:22:32,528 --> 00:22:37,391
One would go about localizing with all these examples and things like that and kind of

247
00:22:37,411 --> 00:22:39,993
tried to, you know, play it up as much as possible.

248
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:46,177
So that was, you know, we made that a big single news item about our game in the exciting

249
00:22:46,237 --> 00:22:47,758
run up to launch and everything.

250
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:52,541
And then, like I said, everyone used Twitter and our game used, you know,

251
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:56,444
We tweeted a whole bunch of stuff about that.

252
00:22:56,844 --> 00:23:01,005
Every time we had someone interested in doing a language

253
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:03,446
or that actually finished a translation,

254
00:23:03,846 --> 00:23:05,726
we would make a big deal out of it on Twitter

255
00:23:05,786 --> 00:23:07,987
and say, hey, here's this awesome translation.

256
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:13,988
And yeah, we posted on the Steam forums for our game

257
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:15,989
and everything like that in order

258
00:23:16,049 --> 00:23:20,330
to try and build this community and get people excited

259
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:22,250
about doing this for us.

260
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:31,096
Obviously a large part of getting people excited about doing this sort of thing was, you know,

261
00:23:31,116 --> 00:23:35,999
people were excited about the game in general, which was obviously really good, and we're very, very gratified for that.

262
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:44,986
But yeah, I think that, you know, making this a big feature that we kind of sold as like,

263
00:23:45,046 --> 00:23:48,508
hey, look what you can do with our game. We're giving you the freedom to...

264
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:57,561
Take our game and translate it, and actually not just that, but you could rewrite the story if you wanted to because all the story is encoded there in text.

265
00:23:58,501 --> 00:24:10,369
If you turn off the audio diaries and just have subtitles and replace all the text, you can tell an entirely different story inside of our game, which you know, we said, hey, check this out, this is really cool, this is the way you can mod Gone Home.

266
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,112
And no one's ever done that, but you know, the potential is there. I hope someone does.

267
00:24:15,132 --> 00:24:18,134
Okay, thanks gentlemen.

268
00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:19,376
Thank you.

269
00:24:19,744 --> 00:24:20,030
Okay.
