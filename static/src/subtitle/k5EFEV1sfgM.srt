1
00:00:05,804 --> 00:00:32,274
everyone's having a wonderful GDC so far. Yeah, yeah, that's right.

2
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:42,857
So, I'm happy to be here. I hope all of you are happy to be here. Not only am I happy to be here

3
00:00:42,857 --> 00:00:52,040
just because it's GDC, it's the first GDC in a couple years. So that's cool. I'm also very happy

4
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:59,082
that we have a video game releasing this week. It's called Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. So that's

5
00:00:59,082 --> 00:01:05,724
pretty cool. Before we get started, I've been told to ask the crowd a few questions.

6
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,662
Uh, if everybody can like move to the center, uh, it looks like everybody's fine.

7
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:12,683
Is everybody fine?

8
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:14,164
Everybody looks good.

9
00:01:14,164 --> 00:01:14,765
Okay.

10
00:01:14,765 --> 00:01:18,407
Uh, turn off your phones and any noise making devices that you might have.

11
00:01:18,407 --> 00:01:22,771
Uh, remember to not record any of this cause, uh, that's illegal.

12
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:22,911
Uh, yeah.

13
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:23,111
Sweet.

14
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:25,393
All right.

15
00:01:30,646 --> 00:01:35,649
So, uh, this is gonna be a talk all about, um, Wonderlands, but don't worry, I'm not gonna spoil

16
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:40,432
anything. There's mainly gonna be talk about the audio systems in the game and stuff like that,

17
00:01:40,432 --> 00:01:47,556
um, and mostly we're gonna cover loot is the main topic and how in audio we kind of, like,

18
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:50,398
make the loot special in our own, uh, specific way.

19
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:54,473
Um, so yeah, shout out to everybody at Gearbox.

20
00:01:54,473 --> 00:01:58,878
I wouldn't be here, you know, there are so many incredible, uh, talented

21
00:01:58,878 --> 00:02:01,641
people on our team and I wouldn't be here if it weren't for all the

22
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:05,665
amazingly, uh, smart, talented and hardworking people that pour their

23
00:02:05,665 --> 00:02:07,146
hearts and souls into everything we do.

24
00:02:07,146 --> 00:02:08,928
Um, so yeah, big shout out to them.

25
00:02:10,216 --> 00:02:13,979
So who am I? I am Joshua Davidson. I'm lead sound designer at Gearbox Software.

26
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:18,122
I was born and raised in Macon, Georgia. I graduated full sail in 2007 with an

27
00:02:18,122 --> 00:02:24,686
associate's degree in recording arts. I started my career in video games back in 2007 at Volition Inc.

28
00:02:25,323 --> 00:02:28,404
I worked on Saints Row 2 and Red Faction Guerrilla while I was there.

29
00:02:28,404 --> 00:02:32,746
I did a little bit of music composition on Red Faction Guerrilla.

30
00:02:32,746 --> 00:02:36,307
Not a whole lot, but it was a fun experience.

31
00:02:36,307 --> 00:02:41,109
I started working at Gearbox in 2009, exactly two years after I started my job at Volition.

32
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:47,331
And the sound design team at that time in 2009 was just Mark Petty, Rayson Varner,

33
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:48,031
and myself.

34
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:52,954
I spent about a month or two helping them finish Borderlands 1.

35
00:02:52,954 --> 00:02:56,936
I mainly finished off some bugs and stuff like that on Borderlands 1

36
00:02:56,936 --> 00:03:01,238
and went straight into work on the DLCs.

37
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:05,039
So Borderlands is kind of known for the long-winded DLCs

38
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:10,402
and that was a really cool experience to just have that quick turnaround cycle

39
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:13,904
of working on a project for a month or two and then pushing it out.

40
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:16,125
We were working very, very fast back then.

41
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:22,510
So yeah, between 2009 and 2010, this is what the audio team was.

42
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,293
It was Mark Petty as an audio director,

43
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:29,457
Raisin Varner, audio lead and composer, Andrew Chaney

44
00:03:29,457 --> 00:03:33,220
was an audio lead too, and I was the young sound designer.

45
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:36,492
We were in this old building in Plano.

46
00:03:36,492 --> 00:03:38,333
This is the old building that we were in between 2009 to 2015.

47
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:44,816
Those audio offices were kind of makeshift audio offices.

48
00:03:44,816 --> 00:03:47,337
They weren't really designed to be audio offices,

49
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:49,438
because it was like in a bank.

50
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,160
So we just put audio panels all around the rooms

51
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,021
and tried to make our best with it.

52
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:56,502
But in 2015, we had an opportunity.

53
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:59,643
We had this opportunity to build an actual game development

54
00:03:59,643 --> 00:04:01,064
studio from the ground up.

55
00:04:01,064 --> 00:04:03,025
And that was really cool, because it means

56
00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:03,946
we can make.

57
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:06,087
an audio facility from the ground up,

58
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:08,449
and actually really, really think about how we want

59
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:11,792
our audio facility to operate.

60
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:13,134
So this is just a little diagram.

61
00:04:13,134 --> 00:04:16,497
That little sloppily drawn circle that I did right there

62
00:04:16,497 --> 00:04:19,019
is where all the audio offices are.

63
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,342
There are six control rooms right there.

64
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:27,927
And we have a live room, and we also have a VO room as well.

65
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:34,840
So the construction of it began in like middle of 2015 or so for the audio offices.

66
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:42,805
And these are kind of like what those preliminary shots of them were looking like before we finished construction on them.

67
00:04:42,805 --> 00:04:47,648
And as we go through, you'll start to see the shape of the offices start to come together.

68
00:04:47,648 --> 00:04:49,450
This is one of the control rooms.

69
00:04:50,335 --> 00:04:52,636
And now we got the desk in there.

70
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:55,138
We got the monitor mounted on the wall.

71
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:58,940
You can see on the sides there, there's

72
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,821
the acoustic foam batting that goes inside the walls.

73
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:03,222
So if you actually touch the walls,

74
00:05:03,222 --> 00:05:06,083
you'll feel like this kind of foam inside of it.

75
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:09,125
And then we have this other layer of cloth

76
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,345
that we put over the top of that.

77
00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:13,467
And then that just kind of helps with the sound more

78
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:15,028
and also makes it aesthetic.

79
00:05:16,268 --> 00:05:20,012
Yeah, and this is when we started to get more of the equipment in.

80
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:23,435
And this is the final look of the office, basically.

81
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:26,037
So, like I said before, we have six control rooms.

82
00:05:26,037 --> 00:05:28,439
One is a Dolby Atmos room now.

83
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,841
It eventually evolved into that around 2019.

84
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:33,791
As we were kind of finishing up Borderlands 3,

85
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,413
we got pretty hardcore about making sure

86
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:39,496
that we are a game supported Atmos.

87
00:05:39,496 --> 00:05:42,639
The control rooms themselves are powered by Yamaha Nuage,

88
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,080
which runs on the Dante network.

89
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,283
I don't know if y'all are familiar with that.

90
00:05:47,063 --> 00:05:53,527
But basically, the Dante network allows us to be able to have every room networked from one to another.

91
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:58,570
So you can set up a microphone in one room and then record in any room you want, really.

92
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:04,053
You can record from control room one to control room six, and vice versa.

93
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:06,575
So it's a really flexible facility that we have.

94
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:13,099
And from 2015 to 2020, we all came to this facility to work every work day.

95
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:15,741
And then the pandemic happened.

96
00:06:16,988 --> 00:06:19,669
So yeah, we were all there when the pandemic changed everything.

97
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:23,111
And Gearbox went fully remote, as did a lot of game developers,

98
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:26,232
and as a lot of different jobs in the world became fully remote.

99
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:28,853
And, you know, things changed very quickly.

100
00:06:28,853 --> 00:06:31,394
Luckily for us, we had shipped Borderlands 3 already.

101
00:06:31,394 --> 00:06:33,314
We'd already got that out the door.

102
00:06:33,314 --> 00:06:35,135
So that was about six months prior.

103
00:06:35,135 --> 00:06:38,096
We were making good progress on the DLCs,

104
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:41,657
but still, this was a drastic change,

105
00:06:41,657 --> 00:06:43,178
and a lot of people had to make adjustments.

106
00:06:43,178 --> 00:06:45,699
And while we were also adjusting...

107
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:48,441
Gearbox was looking to grow in size.

108
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:54,004
And, and, and, uh, despite that pandemic, excuse me, uh, despite the pandemic

109
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:57,307
happening, we did a lot of hiring and, uh, we did a lot of really interesting

110
00:06:57,307 --> 00:07:00,189
things between the start of the pandemic.

111
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:03,611
And now, in fact, that's what I'm about to show you today.

112
00:07:03,611 --> 00:07:04,211
Um, so, um.

113
00:07:05,432 --> 00:07:08,333
So yeah, we started hiring quite a bit.

114
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,934
So this is the audio crew in 2022 in Frisco, Texas.

115
00:07:10,934 --> 00:07:15,916
Frisco, Texas is headquarters for Gearbox right now.

116
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:16,717
So we have Mark Betty.

117
00:07:16,717 --> 00:07:17,937
He's our head of audio.

118
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,398
And now we have a sound design branch.

119
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,419
And so the sound designers are basically

120
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:26,540
the sole content creators for the sound design in our games.

121
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,182
And so we have staff that are just completely dedicated

122
00:07:30,182 --> 00:07:31,102
towards that now.

123
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,780
We also now have tech sound designers.

124
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,883
So our tech sound design team is basically,

125
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:40,125
they're in charge of creating audio systems

126
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,506
and spearheading implementation.

127
00:07:41,506 --> 00:07:43,168
They work on things like occlusion

128
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:45,650
and in-game DSP systems,

129
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,892
such as in-world convolution reverb.

130
00:07:47,892 --> 00:07:51,014
They also help the sound designers

131
00:07:51,014 --> 00:07:52,415
get temporary audio hooked up

132
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:54,397
to the various gameplay systems in our games.

133
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:58,820
So yeah, they have a pretty big task.

134
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,603
And we also have audio code that helps us create the tools

135
00:08:02,603 --> 00:08:05,425
that we all end up utilizing.

136
00:08:05,425 --> 00:08:08,307
We also have VO design now.

137
00:08:08,307 --> 00:08:12,290
We have a, you know, there's a lot of voice in our games.

138
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,872
And it's got to get recorded, edited, organized,

139
00:08:14,872 --> 00:08:15,833
and processed.

140
00:08:16,972 --> 00:08:19,614
We also have an in-house composer, Joshua Caro,

141
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:21,955
and we have a producer, Nate Randall,

142
00:08:21,955 --> 00:08:24,457
that basically helps us keep everything organized

143
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:27,579
and stay on task and everything like that.

144
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:30,881
And we also have Audio QA, an Audio QA lead

145
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:33,482
that helps us track down issues and bugs,

146
00:08:33,482 --> 00:08:35,684
and he's very knowledgeable

147
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:37,004
about all these borderland systems.

148
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:39,286
He's been on our team for over a decade, too,

149
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:42,288
so he kind of can speak our language and so forth.

150
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:44,649
He's a very valuable member of the team.

151
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:46,500
But that's not it.

152
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,481
We have a sister studio.

153
00:08:47,481 --> 00:08:49,842
We have Gearbox Studio Quebec.

154
00:08:49,842 --> 00:08:51,644
And we have staff there.

155
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:54,926
And they've been working on certain different aspects

156
00:08:54,926 --> 00:08:56,187
of Tiny Tina's Wonderlands.

157
00:08:56,187 --> 00:08:59,690
Like, we pretty much let them kind of operate autonomously.

158
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,112
But we have check-ins, and we talk with them a lot

159
00:09:02,112 --> 00:09:05,755
to make sure that we're all on the same page.

160
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:08,036
So that's 21 audio staff.

161
00:09:08,036 --> 00:09:11,799
And remember, a few slides ago, there were only four.

162
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:13,461
So we've come a long way since 2009, 2010.

163
00:09:15,192 --> 00:09:17,552
So yeah, let's get to the fun stuff now.

164
00:09:17,552 --> 00:09:21,653
So now, a couple years back, my colleague Brian Fieser

165
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:24,273
was going to come to this GDC and do

166
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:26,074
a talk on the modular weapon system for Borderlands 3.

167
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:29,335
It's a system that he really pushed for after we

168
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:30,975
hired him in 2016.

169
00:09:30,975 --> 00:09:34,256
And while it took a ton of effort

170
00:09:34,256 --> 00:09:38,036
to work within this modular system, it greatly paid off,

171
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:40,137
and we are extremely proud of it.

172
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:41,617
And over the next few slides, I'll

173
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:43,658
give you a slight overview of the benefits we

174
00:09:43,658 --> 00:09:44,658
got out of that system.

175
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,346
So in previous Borderlands games,

176
00:09:49,346 --> 00:09:50,967
we were limited by memory and scope

177
00:09:50,967 --> 00:09:54,150
with how many weapons we could design and use

178
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,892
with our weapon system.

179
00:09:55,892 --> 00:09:59,194
Like on Borderlands 2, it was a lot more rudimentary.

180
00:09:59,194 --> 00:10:03,038
On Borderlands 3, we had more memory, we had more staff,

181
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:05,259
and we had a bigger overall scope for the project.

182
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:06,721
So we decided to build a system that

183
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:12,245
would allow for placing sounds on individual gun parts.

184
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:19,310
in-house tool, it's known as the Gestalt system basically.

185
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,510
And it basically creates a modular approach

186
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,791
that could strengthen variety

187
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,351
in Sonic character considerably.

188
00:10:24,351 --> 00:10:28,353
The catch though is it requires a lot of content to be made.

189
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:31,174
And for example, the total asset count

190
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:35,375
for all of the gunshots in Borderlands 3

191
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:38,937
ended up about 5,500 individual gunshot sounds.

192
00:10:38,937 --> 00:10:41,998
And for a comparison, we shipped about

193
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:47,393
250 individual gun sounds in Borderlands 2.

194
00:10:47,393 --> 00:10:52,222
So it was quite a huge leap in scope and content creation

195
00:10:52,222 --> 00:10:54,587
that had to fall onto the team.

196
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:55,869
And I think we did a pretty cool job.

197
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:58,635
So yeah, this is actually like a...

198
00:10:58,635 --> 00:11:01,877
This is what the Gestalt system looks like.

199
00:11:01,877 --> 00:11:05,640
Just from the editor perspective, as you can see, there's...

200
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,121
This is a Hyperion shotgun, and

201
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:09,783
you can select all these different types of parts, and

202
00:11:09,783 --> 00:11:12,524
make all sorts of different kind of configurations for

203
00:11:12,524 --> 00:11:15,526
just this one manufacturer-specific weapon.

204
00:11:15,526 --> 00:11:20,330
And every weapon in the game basically

205
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,191
has a system attached to it.

206
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:25,913
Now, this is the debug menu in game

207
00:11:25,913 --> 00:11:27,715
that we can access as developers.

208
00:11:27,715 --> 00:11:31,638
This allows us to basically build any configuration we want.

209
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:33,219
Like in this example, I'm selecting parts

210
00:11:33,219 --> 00:11:35,060
for an uncommon Maliwan sniper rifle.

211
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,442
I can make a very specific configuration

212
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:39,044
if I want in this menu,

213
00:11:39,044 --> 00:11:41,866
or I could just select from a wide variety of parts

214
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:43,007
and let the system create a bunch

215
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:44,628
of random Maliwan sniper rifles

216
00:11:44,628 --> 00:11:47,711
within the part selections that I've chosen, basically.

217
00:11:47,711 --> 00:11:50,553
So on the next slide, I'm gonna show

218
00:11:51,194 --> 00:11:56,257
examples of two Jacobs pistols and two Jacobs assault rifles. They're the same gun,

219
00:11:56,257 --> 00:12:06,324
but listen to how the two pistols sound different from one another and the two assault rifles sound different from one another.

220
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:16,171
If it will work.

221
00:12:16,171 --> 00:12:17,592
And here comes the assault rifle.

222
00:12:29,453 --> 00:12:30,754
So yeah, sometimes with this system

223
00:12:30,754 --> 00:12:32,496
you can get very drastically different sounding

224
00:12:32,496 --> 00:12:35,598
configurations between the same types of guns.

225
00:12:35,598 --> 00:12:37,519
And sometimes they'll feel a little more subtly different

226
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,500
depending on the weapon.

227
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,241
But either way, we achieved something we hadn't

228
00:12:41,241 --> 00:12:43,323
in our games before, and that was something

229
00:12:43,323 --> 00:12:44,083
we were very proud of.

230
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,705
If you play our games, like maybe a certain one

231
00:12:46,705 --> 00:12:49,307
coming out this week, maybe check out

232
00:12:49,307 --> 00:12:51,308
two of the same weapons in your inventory

233
00:12:51,308 --> 00:12:53,350
and notice how they might sound different from one another.

234
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:56,913
Oh, oops, I skipped that.

235
00:12:56,913 --> 00:13:00,856
So if you wanted a deeper dive on just the Borderlands 3

236
00:13:00,856 --> 00:13:05,940
weapon system, you can take a picture of this slide.

237
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,242
I did about a 10-minute video breaking down

238
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:11,004
how I made the sounds for the Maliwan sniper rifles

239
00:13:11,004 --> 00:13:16,087
and also how it basically worked within the framework

240
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,489
of the Borderlands 3 weapon system, essentially.

241
00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:18,529
So.

242
00:13:21,631 --> 00:13:23,772
Now we're jumping forward to today.

243
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:25,032
Over the next few slides, I'll show you

244
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:30,834
how we approached moving from the sound of Borderlands 3

245
00:13:30,834 --> 00:13:34,496
to Wonderlands, into the world of fantasy, essentially.

246
00:13:34,496 --> 00:13:37,837
So the Borderlands aesthetic we were used to

247
00:13:37,837 --> 00:13:40,918
has normally been wildly varied between the organic

248
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:44,199
and the synthetic, combining themes of Western sci-fi.

249
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,620
And there's always been a little bit

250
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,861
of a dash of a fantasy element in Borderlands.

251
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:53,243
I always say to people that Borderlands never really gets old to work on,

252
00:13:53,243 --> 00:13:57,605
because as a sound designer, the world is so very interesting and varied.

253
00:13:57,605 --> 00:14:02,348
It doesn't feel like you're ever doing the same thing at all on a day-to-day basis.

254
00:14:02,348 --> 00:14:05,890
So Wonderlands actually presented us with a new aesthetic challenge

255
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,911
to dive deep into the high fantasy aspect

256
00:14:08,911 --> 00:14:14,334
and really focus on cultivating a Borderlands-y take on magic systems and melee weapons.

257
00:14:14,947 --> 00:14:17,687
There were also some noticeable design changes

258
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:20,408
that influenced our aesthetic choices.

259
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:24,149
We had quite a few new systems being added to the game,

260
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:26,370
in addition to some overhauls of the previous systems

261
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,530
we were working with.

262
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:30,311
And a lot of these big design overhauls

263
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:32,612
influenced the aesthetic we were aiming for.

264
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:35,172
So to amp up the fantasy theme,

265
00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:37,773
we did sort of a remix of the Borderlands 3 weapon system

266
00:14:37,773 --> 00:14:40,154
by adding crossbow barrels and behaviors

267
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:41,894
to familiar Borderlands franchises

268
00:14:41,894 --> 00:14:43,295
and weapons manufacturers.

269
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:55,989
Grenades were also replaced by spells, and they have some really cool behaviors, and I'll cover those in a little bit more depth later, because there's a lot to those.

270
00:14:55,989 --> 00:15:01,994
We also deepened our melee mechanics by adding melee weapons as a form of loot in the game.

271
00:15:01,994 --> 00:15:08,580
So the melee weapon system kind of piggybacks on the modular gun system, essentially.

272
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,362
So as Wonderlands was spinning up on pre-production,

273
00:15:15,362 --> 00:15:18,766
we were still in the midst of Borderlands 3 DLC production.

274
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:21,148
So at the time, we were a bit short on resources

275
00:15:21,148 --> 00:15:24,452
to kind of get the jumpstart on Wonderlands that we needed.

276
00:15:24,452 --> 00:15:27,535
Our associate director of sound design, Brian Fieser,

277
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:29,457
had worked with Paul Stoughton in the past,

278
00:15:29,457 --> 00:15:32,761
and we contacted him to see if he would

279
00:15:32,761 --> 00:15:34,963
want to do some contract work with us.

280
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:39,926
Stoughton, I don't know if you know Paul Stoughton, but he is an industry veteran with amazing

281
00:15:39,926 --> 00:15:45,071
talent and a reputation for creating and releasing his own very high quality professional sound

282
00:15:45,071 --> 00:15:47,113
libraries under his company, Penguin Grenade.

283
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:54,763
We tasked them with helping us basically create our own personal sound libraries

284
00:15:54,763 --> 00:16:00,104
for our team to use once everyone rolled off the DLC and straight into production of Mordorlands.

285
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:05,586
We requested a highly organic library of raw, processed, and designed content.

286
00:16:05,586 --> 00:16:10,267
Having this content for our designers to work with would help ensure that our designers were

287
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:14,088
utilizing the same palette of material in their work,

288
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:17,748
so we could all have a really nice cohesion to our magic audio.

289
00:16:18,869 --> 00:16:25,795
So the raw source material mainly consisted of recordings of organic material that had been cleaned up for us to use and put into SoundMiner.

290
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:37,244
So in the next slide I'll play various examples of what that raw source material is using a few different elemental types.

291
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:43,658
Oops.

292
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:55,089
So once we had that raw source, we would move on and process that source.

293
00:17:55,089 --> 00:17:59,251
So the process source basically takes the raw source that was recorded and

294
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:00,772
adds some heavier processing to it.

295
00:18:00,772 --> 00:18:06,595
So this stuff was intended to be designed and used as a magic layer for our

296
00:18:06,595 --> 00:18:10,638
designers, but you know, it gave, it basically allows the designers to have a

297
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:14,320
lot of wiggle room to have their own forms of creative expression with it.

298
00:19:28,473 --> 00:19:29,815
And finally, there's design source.

299
00:19:29,815 --> 00:19:31,996
We didn't do a whole lot of pre-design source

300
00:19:31,996 --> 00:19:34,198
because pretty much all of this work

301
00:19:34,198 --> 00:19:36,160
happened before a lot of the art and design

302
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,021
had been created in the game.

303
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:41,644
So it was kind of like more audio concept art

304
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:43,345
is what I kind of think of it as.

305
00:19:43,345 --> 00:19:47,208
Either way, it became pretty useful stuff in the end anyway,

306
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,051
and it really kind of got everyone inspired

307
00:19:50,051 --> 00:19:52,473
in thinking about what the real sound

308
00:19:52,473 --> 00:19:55,855
of Wonderland's magic was gonna be.

309
00:19:55,855 --> 00:19:57,496
So here's some examples of that.

310
00:20:31,454 --> 00:20:34,356
So now that we've covered the aesthetic aspects

311
00:20:34,356 --> 00:20:36,257
of Wonderlands, over the next few slides,

312
00:20:36,257 --> 00:20:38,819
we'll talk about how we expanded our modular systems

313
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:41,461
from Borderlands 3.

314
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:43,262
So on Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, we

315
00:20:43,262 --> 00:20:47,485
wanted to take that modularity a step further.

316
00:20:47,485 --> 00:20:49,906
We kept our existing modular system for the guns,

317
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:52,428
but then we also added modular functionality

318
00:20:52,428 --> 00:20:54,309
to other aspects of the games.

319
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:58,472
Most notably, that was the spell casting and the melee weapons.

320
00:21:02,714 --> 00:21:08,358
The cool thing about the Borderlands 3 system is when it came to our new magic guns and our crossbow weapons,

321
00:21:08,358 --> 00:21:12,020
we had a system we knew already would mostly just work.

322
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:17,424
Outside of that, we just had some new RTC PCs that we needed in Wwise,

323
00:21:17,424 --> 00:21:22,447
and after that, the biggest challenge really was nailing down how we wanted the things to sound.

324
00:21:23,388 --> 00:21:26,230
So for the crossbow barrels, we had a challenge.

325
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,852
We wanted them to sound punchy and pretty satisfying

326
00:21:29,852 --> 00:21:31,894
to shoot, kind of like any other Borderlands weapon

327
00:21:31,894 --> 00:21:34,615
in the game, but we needed it to also have this

328
00:21:34,615 --> 00:21:37,317
kind of like old school, kind of medieval crossbow

329
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:38,078
sounding aesthetic.

330
00:21:39,103 --> 00:21:45,466
It took a decent amount of experimentation with the content, but we figured out if we replaced sounds

331
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:50,489
from certain parts on the other guns from Borderlands 3, but kept some key choice layers,

332
00:21:50,489 --> 00:21:56,572
we could keep the familiar signature brand identity for our weapons, but also make them feel, you know, fresh and unique.

333
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,961
So yeah, a good example would be the TORG weapons.

334
00:21:59,961 --> 00:22:02,422
We kept some of those mechanical bombastic thumpy sounds

335
00:22:02,422 --> 00:22:06,744
that you would typically notice in a TORG weapon,

336
00:22:06,744 --> 00:22:10,266
but we added some more of that medieval ballista kind of

337
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:12,307
aspect to the aesthetic of that sound.

338
00:22:12,307 --> 00:22:16,308
So snappy releases, satisfying projectile whooshes,

339
00:22:16,308 --> 00:22:20,110
and here's a video medley of some of those crossbow weapons

340
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,531
to kind of give you an idea of what we ended up going with.

341
00:23:11,452 --> 00:23:13,293
We also had magic weapons in the game.

342
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:16,095
So for magic weapons, we also removed a lot of those

343
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:18,176
like native Borderlands 3 layers

344
00:23:18,176 --> 00:23:20,557
and kept some choice layers for supplementation.

345
00:23:20,557 --> 00:23:23,059
So for example, like a doll assault rifle

346
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:25,800
might keep some of those mechanical Call of Duty

347
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,442
kind of sounding elements and the reload sounds

348
00:23:28,442 --> 00:23:30,423
so they could stay uniquely to doll.

349
00:23:30,423 --> 00:23:33,965
But we added new layers,

350
00:23:33,965 --> 00:23:36,547
it's added to represent like the new magical content.

351
00:23:37,268 --> 00:23:40,693
We kept focus primarily on the weapons elemental magic properties

352
00:23:40,693 --> 00:23:44,398
and crafted those transients and tails around those elements.

353
00:23:44,398 --> 00:23:49,385
We also kept that design language just kind of familiar with those weapon manufacturers.

354
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:53,331
This next slide will show you some of the cool magic weapons we worked on.

355
00:24:42,312 --> 00:24:44,273
I love those poison reloads so much.

356
00:24:46,534 --> 00:24:49,596
So yeah, melee weapons presented an entirely new challenge,

357
00:24:49,596 --> 00:24:52,698
and we didn't have a system for anything like this yet,

358
00:24:52,698 --> 00:24:55,099
so we kind of got to dreaming up one.

359
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:57,581
I knew that we would want to continue our philosophy

360
00:24:57,581 --> 00:25:00,062
of adding audio to specific types of parts,

361
00:25:00,062 --> 00:25:02,544
but I wasn't exactly sure how going into it.

362
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:05,045
There are basically four main types

363
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,266
of melee weapons in the game,

364
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:08,027
and each of those four categories

365
00:25:08,027 --> 00:25:12,289
has three subtypes underneath those.

366
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:13,530
And this is what those look like.

367
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,591
So this is blade type one.

368
00:25:15,191 --> 00:25:21,393
It's a one-handed sword, and those are examples of the three different types of subtypes that go underneath that.

369
00:25:21,393 --> 00:25:27,214
This is Blade Type 2. It's a two-handed sword, and this is a pre-textured version of those subtypes.

370
00:25:27,214 --> 00:25:29,275
I promise they look a lot better now.

371
00:25:29,275 --> 00:25:36,897
And then there's Blade Type 3. These are blunts, so very handed to two-handed weapons.

372
00:25:36,897 --> 00:25:39,397
And those are the three subtypes for those.

373
00:25:39,397 --> 00:25:43,898
And the last one is the one-handed axe and the three subtypes in that family.

374
00:25:45,552 --> 00:25:49,275
So we thought that these could require a lot of content,

375
00:25:49,275 --> 00:25:51,397
and we're always cautious about these kind of things

376
00:25:51,397 --> 00:25:54,600
because more content means more audio,

377
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,182
and more audio usually means more things

378
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:58,624
get loaded into memory.

379
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:02,067
And Wonderlands is also releasing on last-gen consoles,

380
00:26:02,067 --> 00:26:02,788
so we have to be very.

381
00:26:03,268 --> 00:26:07,289
mindful and about that delicate of balance to the approach there.

382
00:26:07,289 --> 00:26:10,430
We played around with a procedural whoosh and loop system first,

383
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:15,132
and the video on the next slide is a very interesting prototype of that

384
00:26:15,132 --> 00:26:19,734
using the tone generator in Wwise. . .

385
00:26:39,184 --> 00:26:43,545
Woo!

386
00:26:43,545 --> 00:26:44,365
Woo!

387
00:26:44,365 --> 00:26:44,525
Woo!

388
00:26:44,525 --> 00:26:44,725
Woo!

389
00:26:44,725 --> 00:26:44,905
Woo!

390
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:45,565
Woo!

391
00:26:45,565 --> 00:26:45,625
Woo!

392
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:49,486
So yeah, that file name is we, weu.mp4.

393
00:26:49,486 --> 00:26:50,506
Very appropriately named.

394
00:26:50,506 --> 00:26:56,347
So there were successes and some drawbacks to that loop system, and I think we could

395
00:26:56,347 --> 00:27:00,748
have gotten there with more time and extra code support, but those resources were kind

396
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:05,308
of limited at the time, so we decided to instead just create a one-shot system for the swings.

397
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,965
And on the next slide I'll show you an example

398
00:27:09,965 --> 00:27:12,809
of how that all comes together basically

399
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:14,972
with a blunt weapon.

400
00:27:14,972 --> 00:27:17,576
So yeah, they're all broken out

401
00:27:17,576 --> 00:27:19,279
into different types of categories

402
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,001
and those whooshes.

403
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:27,672
are very dull for the main subtype, but it gets more interesting when we add things like the

404
00:27:27,672 --> 00:27:33,376
shing layer or the spice layer. So the shing layer is basically the layer that a subtype inherits,

405
00:27:33,376 --> 00:27:35,938
and each subtype has its own unique shing layer.

406
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,962
And each subtype also sometimes has its own,

407
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:43,844
I don't know why we called it this, but the spice layer.

408
00:27:43,844 --> 00:27:47,107
We realized that sometimes just the main woosh

409
00:27:47,107 --> 00:27:50,069
and the shing layer sounded just too literal.

410
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:53,932
Like, yeah, it sounded like a melee weapon swinging,

411
00:27:53,932 --> 00:27:56,474
but it wasn't very cinematic or interesting.

412
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,896
So we would add another layer on top of that

413
00:27:58,896 --> 00:28:01,038
just to kind of make it feel bigger

414
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:03,139
and more impactful as you swung it.

415
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,901
So here's an example of

416
00:28:05,321 --> 00:28:08,742
all those layers combined and some of them, you know,

417
00:28:08,742 --> 00:28:25,447
soloed and then combined rather, excuse me.

418
00:28:25,447 --> 00:28:31,709
So now we'll add the unique shing layer for that subtype there.

419
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,510
And that's just the shing layer soloed.

420
00:28:38,447 --> 00:28:53,438
And this is the spice layer just soloed.

421
00:28:53,438 --> 00:28:57,281
And this is all the layers including a cryo elemental loop layer.

422
00:29:03,297 --> 00:29:09,633
So these all come together just to make this one unique Pacific variations sonic identity.

423
00:29:14,326 --> 00:29:17,528
So we basically utilized Melee impacts in a similar way.

424
00:29:17,528 --> 00:29:20,930
Each parent category had an impact sound associated with it.

425
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,831
So if you're using a blunt weapon,

426
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:25,433
a blunt weapon's gonna have a unique impact

427
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:26,533
just for the blunt weapon.

428
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:31,997
And we kind of, we didn't wanna add too many,

429
00:29:31,997 --> 00:29:35,839
too much unique file names or anything to the system

430
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,921
because memory's a very delicate thing.

431
00:29:38,921 --> 00:29:41,983
So we just kind of, instead of making an impact sound

432
00:29:41,983 --> 00:29:43,584
for each type of, you know.

433
00:29:44,464 --> 00:29:49,568
material like grass or concrete or, you know, glass or something like that.

434
00:29:49,568 --> 00:29:55,173
We basically just created hard and soft generic impact sounds.

435
00:29:55,173 --> 00:30:03,479
And then we layered on top of those our existing generic bucket of sounds that we use for material impacts essentially.

436
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,143
So yeah, that's what we did for those.

437
00:30:07,143 --> 00:30:10,145
And this next slide will show off some of the gameplay

438
00:30:10,145 --> 00:30:12,768
utilizing the systems mentioned previously

439
00:30:12,768 --> 00:30:15,850
with just the one-handed axe weapon, essentially.

440
00:30:45,957 --> 00:30:50,619
Those skeletons are fun to kill.

441
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:52,399
So spells, these are actually my favorite.

442
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:53,180
I like them a ton.

443
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,580
I don't really miss grenades at all,

444
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,301
and I think if you play Wonderlands,

445
00:30:57,301 --> 00:30:59,042
you'll probably feel the same way.

446
00:30:59,042 --> 00:31:01,382
But the spells are also extremely modular,

447
00:31:01,382 --> 00:31:03,243
but their core component can be kind of broken down

448
00:31:03,243 --> 00:31:06,664
into a few main high-level categories.

449
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,985
That would be casting, projectiles, and spell mods.

450
00:31:08,985 --> 00:31:11,866
And casting is very varied.

451
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:13,666
This is all the different types of casting

452
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:14,227
that can occur.

453
00:31:16,047 --> 00:31:21,296
So without going into too much detail, absent from this list are a bunch of the uniques,

454
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:25,443
which are like the legendaries and stuff like that. But I don't want to spoil those.

455
00:31:28,806 --> 00:31:31,867
So there are different types of buildups, loops, and casts

456
00:31:31,867 --> 00:31:32,767
that can be performed.

457
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:35,569
For example, you may have a spell

458
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:39,010
that casts a magical elemental missile via a wand,

459
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,111
or you may see a spell that casts fireballs

460
00:31:41,111 --> 00:31:43,071
from the player's hands.

461
00:31:43,071 --> 00:31:46,153
Some types of spells can instantly cast,

462
00:31:46,153 --> 00:31:48,133
while some can just cast.

463
00:31:48,594 --> 00:31:52,997
like be held down and then let go and then you can cast it that way.

464
00:31:52,997 --> 00:31:56,500
The casting times can also change based on the timing of the

465
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:02,926
they can change timing based on the players like skill or the rarity of the of the spell itself.

466
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:09,211
All these variables come together in the system to create a lot of variety and interesting dynamics

467
00:32:09,211 --> 00:32:12,754
that can change basically the moment to moment gameplay

468
00:32:12,754 --> 00:32:13,935
and play styles up quite a lot.

469
00:32:15,842 --> 00:32:20,984
A lot of these projectiles also that come from these spells,

470
00:32:20,984 --> 00:32:23,666
basically we're able to reuse the main spell,

471
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:25,166
magic missiles audio,

472
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:28,628
because the magic missiles were basically utilizing

473
00:32:28,628 --> 00:32:33,009
all the different types of elemental sounds

474
00:32:33,009 --> 00:32:35,550
from all the other aspects of the game.

475
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:39,692
So every now and then we would need something bespoke,

476
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:40,672
like there's a meteor spell,

477
00:32:40,672 --> 00:32:42,773
so we would need a meteor sound for that,

478
00:32:43,478 --> 00:32:47,367
we or like an elemental hawk or dragon fly out so we need to put some

479
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:50,695
some bespoke creature sounds on those and stuff.

480
00:32:52,632 --> 00:32:56,475
Yeah, and then the last pillar of all the spells are basically the spell mods.

481
00:32:56,475 --> 00:33:01,617
And that's basically like a small way in which a spell can have its behavior changed.

482
00:33:01,617 --> 00:33:07,020
So sometimes they would spawn additional projectiles, and those projectiles could share the same audio.

483
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:13,044
But more often you would get new projectiles, like a whole new giant meteor falling from the sky,

484
00:33:13,044 --> 00:33:17,787
or a gravity well, which is kind of like a singularity.

485
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:21,649
So the next slide will show off a lot of those spells that we...

486
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:22,905
have in the game.

487
00:34:26,072 --> 00:34:28,233
Yeah, that meteor one's my favorite for sure.

488
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:31,656
But yeah, so some final thoughts here.

489
00:34:31,656 --> 00:34:34,298
So as you can see, we've done a lot to expand

490
00:34:34,298 --> 00:34:37,340
the modularity in the Borderlands universe in Wonderlands.

491
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,261
And it's a game based on loot,

492
00:34:39,261 --> 00:34:42,023
and these modular systems add, in our opinion,

493
00:34:42,023 --> 00:34:45,686
a great deal of value to the fundamental core gameplay loop

494
00:34:45,686 --> 00:34:47,888
basically by increasing sonic variety

495
00:34:47,888 --> 00:34:49,349
while also being very practical

496
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:53,652
because we're simply piggybacking on the variable nature

497
00:34:53,652 --> 00:34:55,113
of the gameplay design in our games.

498
00:34:56,014 --> 00:34:58,754
We added a lot of interesting new ideas and content to Wonderlands,

499
00:34:58,754 --> 00:35:02,955
and I'm excited to see where things get taken in the future.

500
00:35:02,955 --> 00:35:04,875
And I hope you all pick it up at some point

501
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:08,136
and enjoy the amazing hard work our entire team did

502
00:35:08,136 --> 00:35:09,316
making all this come together.

503
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:13,137
So a big shout-out to everyone on the audio team back at Gearbox.

504
00:35:13,137 --> 00:35:14,657
They are incredible people,

505
00:35:14,657 --> 00:35:18,297
and they have so much collective and extraordinary talent.

506
00:35:18,297 --> 00:35:21,058
You just heard a lot of the work that they did,

507
00:35:21,058 --> 00:35:22,858
and I'm super proud of them.

508
00:35:22,858 --> 00:35:24,058
And thank you all for coming.

509
00:35:33,032 --> 00:35:35,493
I guess we can do Q&A, because we've got still a little bit of time.

510
00:35:35,493 --> 00:35:36,973
If anybody wants to ask any questions or anything.

511
00:35:36,973 --> 00:35:37,113
Carson.

512
00:35:37,113 --> 00:35:37,173
Yes.

513
00:35:37,173 --> 00:35:39,775
How much changing, so the audio concept art that you made, the visual for an area, do

514
00:35:39,775 --> 00:35:49,859
you find that some of those, like, really...

515
00:35:57,689 --> 00:36:01,295
Um, actually the, we didn't do a whole, uh, the question was how, how, how

516
00:36:01,295 --> 00:36:03,378
useful was the audio concept?

517
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:04,881
Oh, by the way, there's a microphone over there.

518
00:36:04,881 --> 00:36:06,083
I just realized.

519
00:36:07,263 --> 00:36:07,944
I'm new to this.

520
00:36:07,944 --> 00:36:12,906
Yeah, the question was how much did the audio concept art

521
00:36:12,906 --> 00:36:15,107
change, and how much did it actually work out?

522
00:36:15,107 --> 00:36:16,547
It actually worked out pretty well.

523
00:36:16,547 --> 00:36:22,029
The only thing that we mainly just prototyped casting sounds,

524
00:36:22,029 --> 00:36:24,410
because we knew that we were going to need those.

525
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,291
And really, all that was needed was just

526
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:28,652
like a little bit of timing adjustments here and there.

527
00:36:28,652 --> 00:36:29,712
But that was about it.

528
00:36:29,712 --> 00:36:31,533
But we didn't do a whole lot of that,

529
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:33,514
because it would have been a huge investment just

530
00:36:33,514 --> 00:36:34,054
to work it out.

531
00:36:34,715 --> 00:36:37,341
not know if it was going to pan out, but most of it did, yeah.

532
00:36:37,341 --> 00:36:40,287
There's a microphone there and a line there,

533
00:36:40,287 --> 00:36:43,273
so if you want to ask a question, yeah.

534
00:36:43,273 --> 00:36:44,456
What's up?

535
00:36:44,456 --> 00:36:45,278
Thanks for the talk.

536
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:56,443
I was wondering, with the modular system, I'm guessing it means that some weapons can have a ton of voices playing every time they do their thing.

537
00:36:56,443 --> 00:37:06,048
Did you have any constraints related to that and what are techniques you maybe used to reduce the voice impact of having this modular system?

538
00:37:06,609 --> 00:37:07,549
Yeah, that's a good question.

539
00:37:07,549 --> 00:37:11,151
So the modular system, it's not like, you know,

540
00:37:11,151 --> 00:37:13,712
we have a lot of parts to choose from to put sounds on,

541
00:37:13,712 --> 00:37:17,033
but we didn't use all the parts, you know.

542
00:37:17,033 --> 00:37:22,176
We, like, for example, on Borderlands 3,

543
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:24,457
each gun type has three different types of barrels.

544
00:37:25,057 --> 00:37:30,479
and each barrel has three subtypes called barrel mods,

545
00:37:30,479 --> 00:37:32,459
just kind of like how the melee weapons

546
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:34,220
had three subtypes.

547
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,701
So we would basically kind of piggyback on that

548
00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:39,822
and we would also put sounds on like the muzzle

549
00:37:39,822 --> 00:37:42,062
and like the grip and a few other parts.

550
00:37:42,062 --> 00:37:46,224
So generally at one time what's usually happening

551
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:47,224
is like you're hearing about.

552
00:37:48,064 --> 00:37:54,786
five to six different sounds playing on top of each other at the same time, but it rarely goes

553
00:37:54,786 --> 00:37:58,927
more than that unless there's some specific like edge case, which there probably is because there's

554
00:37:58,927 --> 00:38:05,309
so many different types of guns, so. But we test it all the time and so we usually don't find too

555
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:09,630
many crazy edge cases like that, but yeah, it can happen for sure. That's a good question.

556
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,550
Thanks.

557
00:38:13,321 --> 00:38:14,361
Hello, my name's Owen.

558
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:18,002
Um, I would let you kind of like, if you can go more into like the modular

559
00:38:18,002 --> 00:38:21,883
philosophy and more about that, like, cause I understand, I mean, with sound

560
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,823
designing, you want to, you know, add more layers that you were doing to kind

561
00:38:24,823 --> 00:38:28,524
of create more distinction between different sounds, but what is that modular

562
00:38:28,524 --> 00:38:30,085
philosophy that you were talking about?

563
00:38:30,085 --> 00:38:31,785
If you can go more into detail about that.

564
00:38:31,785 --> 00:38:34,545
Um, just like the sound design philosophy for them, like, like what

565
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:35,666
sound do we put on what part?

566
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:37,286
Like that kind of thing.

567
00:38:37,286 --> 00:38:42,087
So yeah, like, uh, typically like, um, for.

568
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:46,388
You know, each sound designer kind of approaches it a little bit differently.

569
00:38:46,388 --> 00:38:50,630
But like a lot of us put like, for example, on the muzzle,

570
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:54,613
that's where we kind of choose what tail sound plays.

571
00:38:54,613 --> 00:38:57,995
Yeah. And like for the grip, like we'll have a different type of transient crack

572
00:38:57,995 --> 00:39:02,757
for that. And so we'll give each one of those parts like its own family of sounds.

573
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:06,900
And we kind of, you know, we approach it differently for every type of weapon.

574
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,541
I did a lot of the work on the Maliwan sniper rifles, for example.

575
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:17,083
And I would just kind of find families of sounds that felt good for certain parts and kind of go from there.

576
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:20,244
And, you know, like when I first started working on this modular system,

577
00:39:20,244 --> 00:39:24,365
it was Brian Feaser who kind of spearheaded the whole development of it.

578
00:39:24,365 --> 00:39:31,326
And I got to admit, I started working on the Maliwan SMGs and they just sounded like trash for like an entire month.

579
00:39:31,907 --> 00:39:36,148
And it really took me taking a break from the Maliwan SMGs,

580
00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:39,430
and then I started working on the Maliwan sniper rifles.

581
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,391
And I just kind of had that fresh perspective, you know,

582
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:44,632
and like, I would make like some pretty cool, like,

583
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:47,113
synth punch layers and stuff like that, like laser pews,

584
00:39:47,113 --> 00:39:49,514
you know, and stuff, and I would put them on,

585
00:39:49,514 --> 00:39:52,015
I would give a certain part a family of pews,

586
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:52,435
and then some...

587
00:39:52,796 --> 00:39:57,519
Some parts would get more of a body, like a bottom low end layer and stuff like that.

588
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:04,084
So the philosophy is more like exploring the feeling of the sound and allowing yourself the time to kind of like create that

589
00:40:04,084 --> 00:40:06,786
similar to my family's sounds that we're probably married again.

590
00:40:06,786 --> 00:40:07,387
Yeah, yeah, totally.

591
00:40:07,387 --> 00:40:08,628
Okay, cool. Thank you so much.

592
00:40:08,628 --> 00:40:09,388
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

593
00:40:11,902 --> 00:40:20,351
Hi, I was just curious about the procedural exploration that you did with the Wise Tone Generator,

594
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:24,094
and what eventually led you to abandon using that on this project,

595
00:40:24,094 --> 00:40:28,079
and whether you think it's feasible that you might use it for this purpose on future projects.

596
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:29,684
Yeah, that's a good question.

597
00:40:29,684 --> 00:40:34,287
So the looping system, it was mainly,

598
00:40:34,287 --> 00:40:38,709
we just didn't have, like, we didn't at the time,

599
00:40:38,709 --> 00:40:41,870
our code staff were kind of ramping up

600
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,292
on kind of some other engine side work stuff.

601
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:46,993
So we didn't really have the code support

602
00:40:46,993 --> 00:40:48,914
that we needed to get that done at that time.

603
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:51,455
So that was kind of why we ended up abandoning it.

604
00:40:51,455 --> 00:40:52,135
We were like,

605
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,512
I'm not exactly sure.

606
00:40:57,512 --> 00:41:00,997
We were kind of, we were really in the thick of development at that time.

607
00:41:00,997 --> 00:41:04,943
So adding like really, really brand new features was like risky.

608
00:41:04,943 --> 00:41:08,628
So we just kind of had to, and it kind of, that's why we kind of stuck with what we

609
00:41:08,628 --> 00:41:13,014
knew, you know, and just kind of stuck with like the one shot method, you know, and.

610
00:41:13,175 --> 00:41:14,775
That ended up working out well, but yeah,

611
00:41:14,775 --> 00:41:18,817
and I think in the future, something like much more,

612
00:41:18,817 --> 00:41:20,758
you know, because like what's cool about like

613
00:41:20,758 --> 00:41:24,480
a looping system is you can get away with like

614
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,721
doing a very little amount of content

615
00:41:26,721 --> 00:41:28,462
and get a lot of mileage out of it.

616
00:41:28,462 --> 00:41:30,743
You know, like I've seen some really cool systems

617
00:41:30,743 --> 00:41:34,344
from some games, you know, that can utilize fully that way,

618
00:41:34,344 --> 00:41:36,325
essentially, you know, like just with a few loops,

619
00:41:36,325 --> 00:41:40,607
like you can have, you know, with like one six second loop,

620
00:41:40,607 --> 00:41:41,968
essentially you could probably like.

621
00:41:42,588 --> 00:41:47,395
do a whole game's worth of audio with that, you know, but that's, that's like a whole,

622
00:41:47,395 --> 00:41:52,983
whole nother, hopefully we'll, we'll have like a GDC talk on something like that in the future.

623
00:41:52,983 --> 00:41:53,364
Thank you.

624
00:41:53,364 --> 00:41:53,564
Yeah.

625
00:41:55,726 --> 00:41:59,390
Hi. Jumping back to the whole modular approach of weapons,

626
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:04,275
how do you make sure that things aren't clashing in a weird way?

627
00:42:04,275 --> 00:42:06,557
For instance, like you have some transients on something

628
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,740
and there's some body or spice or the tails.

629
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:11,823
How do you make sure that it all kind of amalgamates

630
00:42:11,823 --> 00:42:15,627
into a good sounding thing rather than like random stuff going?

631
00:42:15,962 --> 00:42:20,324
Yeah, the trick there is to not put,

632
00:42:20,324 --> 00:42:23,305
just be very choiceful in your decisions

633
00:42:23,305 --> 00:42:25,006
on what parts you use.

634
00:42:25,006 --> 00:42:27,487
Try not to use every part for a family of guns.

635
00:42:27,487 --> 00:42:29,427
Like I kind of mentioned before,

636
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:31,248
just use barrels, barrel mods.

637
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,489
And the same thing happened with the melee stuff.

638
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,212
We really, when you're swinging a melee weapon,

639
00:42:37,212 --> 00:42:39,534
there's usually not gonna be more than three or four sounds

640
00:42:39,534 --> 00:42:41,457
and they're all whooshes, you know,

641
00:42:41,457 --> 00:42:44,800
so they kind of naturally blend together

642
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,863
and it just takes a little bit of experimentation

643
00:42:46,863 --> 00:42:49,145
just to make sure like they're, you know.

644
00:42:49,847 --> 00:42:51,909
you know, in the frequency spectrum sense of things,

645
00:42:51,909 --> 00:42:54,371
that they all kind of like fit their own,

646
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,513
fit in their own frequency space essentially.

647
00:42:56,513 --> 00:42:58,834
Like that's why the shings are kind of just like

648
00:42:58,834 --> 00:42:59,695
a very resonant,

649
00:42:59,695 --> 00:43:01,977
that are kind of like a resonant spike essentially.

650
00:43:01,977 --> 00:43:05,640
And you know, the whooshes are more dull and more low mid,

651
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,362
you know, and then like the spicy layers are kind of like,

652
00:43:08,362 --> 00:43:09,883
you know, a little bit,

653
00:43:09,883 --> 00:43:11,965
you hear a little bit more higher frequencies with those,

654
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:15,027
that kind of sells more of the wind whooshes

655
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:17,950
and like the passage of air going through the weapon

656
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:18,670
essentially I think.

657
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:18,870
Okay.

658
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:25,897
So you're kind of assigning more throughout the frequency spectrum to the different modular parts of the gun to make sure that there's no...

659
00:43:25,897 --> 00:43:34,346
Yeah, and I kind of showed that debug window that we have in our game, and that allows us to really, really, really test it thoroughly.

660
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:40,091
And it also allows us to kind of really see how random things can get.

661
00:43:40,091 --> 00:43:41,693
And so you can just like spawn a...

662
00:43:42,234 --> 00:43:47,017
a thousand variations of that particular type of weapon.

663
00:43:47,017 --> 00:43:51,581
And that can enable you to just really pick them all up

664
00:43:51,581 --> 00:43:54,103
and play with them and see if you're going to get any weird things.

665
00:43:54,103 --> 00:43:57,225
But after a while, we, you know, at first,

666
00:43:57,225 --> 00:44:01,428
I was, like I was saying with the Malinois SMGs on Borderlands 3,

667
00:44:01,428 --> 00:44:03,070
I was, everything sounded like a mess

668
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:06,272
because I didn't know what I was doing with this system for a while.

669
00:44:06,272 --> 00:44:10,656
But really, I think just having the right amount of layers

670
00:44:10,656 --> 00:44:11,376
and just knowing...

671
00:44:11,877 --> 00:44:15,518
how to design them, it just takes time working with the system and like, um,

672
00:44:15,518 --> 00:44:19,058
everybody who, everybody who's worked with the system, all of our sound

673
00:44:19,058 --> 00:44:23,820
designers that have come up, the new, the new guys and stuff, like they're

674
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,920
extremely intimidated by the system and it, you know, but it, and that's very

675
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:31,302
understandable, but once you've, it really, it really takes a little bit of

676
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:35,483
lead time work, like to really get used to working in it and like, it takes a

677
00:44:35,483 --> 00:44:39,184
couple of months sometimes to just to really get a good feel for it because

678
00:44:39,184 --> 00:44:40,824
it's pretty complex for sure.

679
00:44:41,372 --> 00:44:41,945
Thank you.

680
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:42,232
Mm-hmm.

681
00:44:44,642 --> 00:44:50,243
Hello. Well, first of all, I'm sorry, I have a couple of questions, but I'll try to keep them really quick.

682
00:44:50,243 --> 00:44:57,164
So, in creating of a gun sound, do you start with natural guns sometimes, or you prefer to start everything synthetic?

683
00:44:57,164 --> 00:45:01,745
In terms of taking a real gun and recording it just because it might be more natural,

684
00:45:01,745 --> 00:45:07,907
and maybe there are some sounds that would keep it more as a better clue.

685
00:45:07,907 --> 00:45:11,848
However, maybe over-exaggerating would be better in general.

686
00:45:11,848 --> 00:45:14,528
So, what is your approach to creating this type of sound?

687
00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:21,716
Yeah, my experience mainly working in the system for the guns specifically is like,

688
00:45:21,716 --> 00:45:27,002
I mainly worked on Maliwan weapons and I'm a big synth nerd,

689
00:45:27,002 --> 00:45:30,466
so that's kind of where I feel most comfortable, you know, naturally.

690
00:45:30,466 --> 00:45:35,652
So I kind of, on Borderlands 3, we had a lot of pre-production time where...

691
00:45:36,856 --> 00:45:39,918
Like my colleague, Rason Varner, and I,

692
00:45:39,918 --> 00:45:41,739
we were using Serum like crazy

693
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,301
and just constantly making patches with it.

694
00:45:44,301 --> 00:45:47,023
And I was making a lot of synth patches with Serum

695
00:45:47,023 --> 00:45:49,484
and learning to design my own laser sounds,

696
00:45:49,484 --> 00:45:51,765
like laser pews and things like that.

697
00:45:51,765 --> 00:45:55,088
And so I started personally with the synthetic stuff,

698
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:57,569
but you can't just use that, you know,

699
00:45:57,569 --> 00:45:59,670
because like using just the synthesizer

700
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:01,191
or raw synthesizer sound

701
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:03,553
is gonna sound completely awkward in the game

702
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:04,593
because...

703
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:07,720
That's not how a real gun would sound in real life.

704
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,181
I always like to layer in real weapons

705
00:46:10,181 --> 00:46:12,222
and kind of dirty it up with saturation and stuff

706
00:46:12,222 --> 00:46:14,842
to kind of pull back that really clean sound

707
00:46:14,842 --> 00:46:17,323
that a synth can have, especially a software synth

708
00:46:17,323 --> 00:46:19,944
like CRM, it's very, very clean.

709
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:22,425
So you kind of have to find unique ways

710
00:46:22,425 --> 00:46:25,226
to dirty it up a little bit and make it feel more fresh.

711
00:46:25,226 --> 00:46:26,786
So do you put sometimes the real sound

712
00:46:26,786 --> 00:46:28,587
into the sampler in the CRM itself

713
00:46:28,587 --> 00:46:31,728
and then start using some of the algorithms there?

714
00:46:31,728 --> 00:46:32,628
The wavetables?

715
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,985
Yeah, in the wavetables. Do you use it or you just do it separately?

716
00:46:36,985 --> 00:46:42,571
I have used my own custom wavetables, but I've done them more as like just an experiment.

717
00:46:42,571 --> 00:46:45,735
I didn't do that with gun sounds though, but that's a cool idea for sure.

718
00:46:46,023 --> 00:46:49,225
Okay, well, another quick question.

719
00:46:49,225 --> 00:46:50,686
So about the recording processes,

720
00:46:50,686 --> 00:46:52,827
I assume that in the beginning when you started,

721
00:46:52,827 --> 00:46:57,229
it was probably more difficult because you needed to,

722
00:46:57,229 --> 00:46:58,230
in both cases, you needed to have a studio

723
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:59,250
and a good environment.

724
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,432
What was the regular problem with recording

725
00:47:02,432 --> 00:47:06,234
and did you have to, I mean, you probably have to fix

726
00:47:06,234 --> 00:47:07,795
some of the sounds and clean them up.

727
00:47:07,795 --> 00:47:09,196
What were you doing with this?

728
00:47:09,196 --> 00:47:10,596
For example, if you recorded a sound,

729
00:47:10,596 --> 00:47:12,317
but there's some background noise

730
00:47:12,317 --> 00:47:13,598
or some frequencies picking up

731
00:47:13,598 --> 00:47:15,539
that are not natural to the sound.

732
00:47:16,354 --> 00:47:18,176
Yeah, so like when it came to...

733
00:47:18,176 --> 00:47:19,737
Refer to re-record it.

734
00:47:19,737 --> 00:47:22,679
Yeah, we actually enlisted some outsourcing partners

735
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:24,541
to help us get like recordings of guns.

736
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:27,283
We also recorded guns ourselves

737
00:47:27,283 --> 00:47:29,685
and got those files cleaned up.

738
00:47:29,685 --> 00:47:31,927
So yeah, that's pretty much what we did with that.

739
00:47:31,927 --> 00:47:35,109
We also, this is actually a pretty funny story,

740
00:47:35,109 --> 00:47:36,531
and this is a very Texas story

741
00:47:36,531 --> 00:47:38,052
if you've ever heard a Texas story,

742
00:47:38,052 --> 00:47:42,195
but we sent out an email to the team

743
00:47:43,216 --> 00:47:48,680
asking, hey, who wants to record some guns and gun foley and stuff like that?

744
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,842
And so, um, this was probably like in 2017 or something like that.

745
00:47:50,842 --> 00:47:54,245
And it was just a blast to the whole company.

746
00:47:54,245 --> 00:47:57,427
And I think we got like 50 emails back or something like that.

747
00:47:57,427 --> 00:47:58,248
Yeah, I got a gun.

748
00:47:58,248 --> 00:47:58,828
Let's record it.

749
00:47:58,828 --> 00:47:59,068
You know?

750
00:47:59,068 --> 00:48:05,273
And so we, we invited people to our Foley room and basically we created this giant

751
00:48:05,273 --> 00:48:10,137
like library of Foley sounds, uh, for the reloads and things like that, just.

752
00:48:10,397 --> 00:48:14,939
simply based on all the people at Gearbox that seem to have guns.

753
00:48:14,939 --> 00:48:18,441
Some of them have quite an arsenal, which is impressive.

754
00:48:18,441 --> 00:48:25,785
Yeah, it brought them to the office. Yeah, probably shouldn't tell people that.

755
00:48:25,785 --> 00:48:26,365
Yeah, but yeah.

756
00:48:27,229 --> 00:48:31,750
Another question, the deadlines in a company, how long and do they change through the time?

757
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:36,311
Because you started with a smaller team and probably when the company grows,

758
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:38,832
the deadlines and it becomes more strict.

759
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:44,013
However, the more there are layers in the processes, the more something could go wrong.

760
00:48:44,013 --> 00:48:48,314
How often do you deal with situations when you need to produce the sound or

761
00:48:48,314 --> 00:48:50,595
deliver the sound in a really short time?

762
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:51,135
Do you prefer to...

763
00:48:52,266 --> 00:48:59,631
be more creative or go with a more safer approach if we're using most of the sounds and just adding something to that to make it more unique?

764
00:48:59,631 --> 00:49:07,056
I mean, that's different depending on what... It's different depending on what phase of the project you're in.

765
00:49:07,056 --> 00:49:09,618
Like, if you're in pre-production, you have time to do...

766
00:49:09,618 --> 00:49:14,181
Like, we're getting more disciplined with this over time, like you were saying, like...

767
00:49:14,941 --> 00:49:19,903
Gearbox is getting bigger. We have to kind of like process orient things a little bit more so like

768
00:49:19,903 --> 00:49:22,504
doing pre-production now is like

769
00:49:22,504 --> 00:49:30,606
We will work on design documents. We'll work on prototypes. We'll work on mock-ups and things like that for us for a particular

770
00:49:31,407 --> 00:49:36,329
type of design feature that's coming down the pipe. We'll get as much of like high level stuff done

771
00:49:36,329 --> 00:49:41,912
very early on, but we can't, we'll have to revisit that later whenever the design actually gets

772
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:45,954
implemented into the game. So there's like a stagger process now, but, and that's always

773
00:49:45,954 --> 00:49:52,417
changing for sure. Okay, and what's the most common problem you have to face with everything?

774
00:49:52,417 --> 00:49:57,360
All right, this will be the last question because you got a big line behind you, buddy. Sorry,

775
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,482
then never mind. Okay, you're good. Thank you very much. Yeah, you're good.

776
00:50:01,841 --> 00:50:06,944
Hi, yeah I was curious about the, you mentioned there were some new real-time parameter controls you used,

777
00:50:06,944 --> 00:50:13,527
I was wondering if any of that you would consider played a part in your modular system.

778
00:50:13,527 --> 00:50:16,568
I know you scrapped the procedural tone generator,

779
00:50:16,568 --> 00:50:22,711
but I was curious if there was any procedural kind of real-time parameter control or if all that was baked in.

780
00:50:23,032 --> 00:50:29,534
Yeah, like the RDPCs that we created for these are basically like things that helped change the timing of the weapon,

781
00:50:29,534 --> 00:50:34,896
depending on the variable rate of speed that it's being swung at, which can happen with the loot basically.

782
00:50:34,896 --> 00:50:39,218
So our tech sound designer, Jesse Lemons, was pretty much primarily the guy that set that up.

783
00:50:39,218 --> 00:50:48,002
But so I'm not exactly sure what the exact parameters were, but they basically could change the rate of time and pitch to kind of like affect the parameter based on how

784
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:50,585
you know, what the loot swings at,

785
00:50:50,585 --> 00:50:52,506
what time it swings at, because, you know,

786
00:50:52,506 --> 00:50:55,007
in Borderlands, you can level up your character,

787
00:50:55,007 --> 00:50:59,609
and sometimes that'll change the way you swing things,

788
00:50:59,609 --> 00:51:02,010
or how, you know, how fast it goes and things like that.

789
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:06,331
So we have RTPCs that kind of like

790
00:51:06,331 --> 00:51:08,072
piggyback on that, basically.

791
00:51:08,072 --> 00:51:10,053
Okay, yeah, so did that affect the layering?

792
00:51:10,053 --> 00:51:11,533
Because it seems like a lot of the modularity

793
00:51:11,533 --> 00:51:12,433
was about the layering.

794
00:51:13,145 --> 00:51:23,975
It did on the guns. So the guns, like, typically whenever we're working with guns, sometimes you'll want to change the volume of a layer

795
00:51:23,975 --> 00:51:28,799
based on some parameter that you want to control.

796
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:34,683
So like if you have a higher rate of speed or like if you have, here's a good one, like whenever

797
00:51:34,683 --> 00:51:39,165
you're getting low on ammo, for example, we have an RTPC that kind of like starts to duck certain

798
00:51:39,165 --> 00:51:44,729
layers and bring more mechanical layers up. So like you'll hear that and then you'll hear that,

799
00:51:44,729 --> 00:51:49,051
you know, it cues the player in essentially to, oh, I'm running low on ammo. So we have like a

800
00:51:49,051 --> 00:51:53,914
lot of little RTPCs that do those kind of small little detailed kind of things. Great. Thank you

801
00:51:53,914 --> 00:51:54,395
so much. Yeah.

802
00:51:56,763 --> 00:52:03,492
Just a quick question about the raw processing stage that you mentioned that you did with your library.

803
00:52:03,492 --> 00:52:10,561
How much manual work was involved with that? Did you do much editing between the different types or was it more just batch processing?

804
00:52:11,832 --> 00:52:18,978
So we, pretty much for that whole library setup, Paul Stoughton, he's the guy that was behind that,

805
00:52:18,978 --> 00:52:26,324
he recorded a lot of that stuff himself and then also spent the time like, you know, doing the RX treatment on it and basically cleaning it up.

806
00:52:26,324 --> 00:52:30,208
And we would divide all those things out into folders by elemental type.

807
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:32,149
Each elemental type folder had a raw...

808
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:37,674
a folder full of just random things like that, like the bedsheets tearing or, you know, ice

809
00:52:37,674 --> 00:52:41,617
crackling and things like that. And then they would each have that process folder as well with

810
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:46,600
the more, the more, uh, interesting, like, you know, effects added to those, to the raw source

811
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,844
and stuff. And then the design folder usually didn't have that much stuff on it, because like

812
00:52:50,844 --> 00:52:57,269
I was saying earlier, it's pretty much just, it was kind of more used as a concept kind of phase.

813
00:52:57,269 --> 00:52:58,530
Did I, did that answer your question at all?

814
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:04,979
I think so, so the processed stage was that mostly just effects, it wasn't sort of any

815
00:53:04,979 --> 00:53:07,603
sort of like actual editing together of different...

816
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:15,885
No, not really. It would be mostly just cool editing. I know Stoughton likes to use Traveler.

817
00:53:15,885 --> 00:53:21,589
So for a lot of those whooshes that he makes, he would actually take the... He showed me how

818
00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:26,834
he did it, but he basically would take the raw source and then just kind of... He can make really

819
00:53:26,834 --> 00:53:30,877
cool transients out of the raw source. And sometimes, yeah, he would layer things just

820
00:53:30,877 --> 00:53:34,420
to kind of beef them up a little bit because, yeah, you've probably heard some of those probably

821
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:36,041
have a little bit more... A lot more body.

822
00:53:36,301 --> 00:53:40,563
you know, than the raw source did. So he would use Traveler to kind of get those really dynamic

823
00:53:40,563 --> 00:53:47,047
whooshes. I know he uses actually by the same company, you know, it's called Woosh.

824
00:53:47,047 --> 00:53:51,509
Tarnstrom Woosh. I think it's, I don't know how you say, is it Tarnstrom? I don't know.

825
00:53:51,509 --> 00:53:59,333
But yeah, he would use that a lot. And so he would take that raw source and then make some cool,

826
00:53:59,333 --> 00:54:03,576
interesting things out of it that could be useful for our other sound designers to kind of like

827
00:54:03,576 --> 00:54:05,157
pick through and layer and things like that.

828
00:54:05,485 --> 00:54:06,226
Yeah, great, thank you.

829
00:54:06,226 --> 00:54:11,154
Hey, I was wondering, with a team of 21 sound designers

830
00:54:11,154 --> 00:54:15,520
and all making modular layers that have different purposes

831
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:18,565
for different guns, and you're all using the same

832
00:54:18,565 --> 00:54:20,548
like source library that is custom made,

833
00:54:21,274 --> 00:54:25,059
Was there some kind of agreed upon signal chain or mixing mastering chain at the end

834
00:54:25,059 --> 00:54:30,266
of the process for individual layers, like certain DB that you're like aiming for, or

835
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:34,192
was there like certain plugins or like everyone were using this compressor at the

836
00:54:34,192 --> 00:54:35,834
end of the chain or I don't know?

837
00:54:35,834 --> 00:54:37,176
Uh, no, no, not at all.

838
00:54:37,176 --> 00:54:37,656
Actually.

839
00:54:37,656 --> 00:54:38,838
We don't, we don't really, uh.

840
00:54:39,539 --> 00:54:43,763
mandate that our sound designers do anything.

841
00:54:43,763 --> 00:54:46,225
We're not that process oriented.

842
00:54:46,225 --> 00:54:49,729
We definitely have certain like pillars and style guides

843
00:54:49,729 --> 00:54:51,090
that we want them to reference,

844
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:54,053
but whatever tools our sound designers want to use,

845
00:54:54,053 --> 00:54:54,753
we let them do it.

846
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:59,058
And we don't really have any specific like set requirements

847
00:54:59,058 --> 00:55:00,619
because we kind of feel like that kind of limits

848
00:55:00,619 --> 00:55:01,980
the creativity a little bit too much.

849
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,062
And we also don't have...

850
00:55:03,902 --> 00:55:08,464
We don't have that many people actually working on the modular stuff, you know,

851
00:55:08,464 --> 00:55:14,946
it's usually like four or five people at most, you know, so it's a little bit easier to kind of like

852
00:55:14,946 --> 00:55:19,987
see where everybody is. It's not like everybody's just throwing stuff at the system. It's only like

853
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:24,829
a few of us pretty much doing it at one time and we're all reviewing each other's work and stuff.

854
00:55:24,829 --> 00:55:27,370
So all right, perfect. That's the answer I wanted to get. Yeah, thanks.

855
00:55:30,566 --> 00:55:46,511
Hi, going off of that question, once all the audio is implemented, when you are mixing and mastering, is this only in Wwise or are there iterative sessions where your sound designers start mixing in the DAW, they do it in Wwise, and then there's one?

856
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:52,344
Yeah, all the content is created in the DAW and then all the in-game aspects are mixed in Wwise.

857
00:55:52,344 --> 00:55:56,066
So we hook Wwise up live to the game and we do the mixing there.

858
00:55:56,066 --> 00:56:03,051
And we also, like when it comes to the actual mix down of the game, we go to the office.

859
00:56:03,051 --> 00:56:08,755
So we actually spent a lot of December at the office mixing the game and we all sit in the room together.

860
00:56:09,475 --> 00:56:13,057
a few of us sit in a room together and kind of participate.

861
00:56:13,057 --> 00:56:16,359
And we're in the Dolby Atmos room at our studio essentially.

862
00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:20,621
And yeah, so we all kind of like sit there,

863
00:56:20,621 --> 00:56:22,883
we mix it, we find what levels we like it to sit at

864
00:56:22,883 --> 00:56:25,744
and just kind of all vibe together

865
00:56:25,744 --> 00:56:28,305
and kind of come to a consensus on something, yeah.

866
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:31,467
Okay, and is it separate for stereo mixes

867
00:56:31,467 --> 00:56:33,148
and surround sound mixes?

868
00:56:33,148 --> 00:56:37,470
Or is there like mix down that can naturally be?

869
00:56:38,296 --> 00:56:41,098
Sorry, could you say that again? I just couldn't hear it.

870
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:46,422
For people who have those surround sound speakers at home versus stereo,

871
00:56:46,422 --> 00:56:48,483
are those two separate mixes you send out?

872
00:56:48,483 --> 00:56:48,583
Oh, no.

873
00:56:48,583 --> 00:56:54,067
Basically, most of the files in our game are going to be mono,

874
00:56:54,067 --> 00:56:56,169
but for weapons, we typically do stereo.

875
00:56:56,169 --> 00:57:00,332
And whenever it comes to mixing in Dolby Atmos,

876
00:57:00,332 --> 00:57:03,754
we do very, very choice scenes

877
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:06,096
to really highlight the Dolby Atmos experience.

878
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:12,960
I can't, I don't want to spoil anything, but there are some in the game that we purposely

879
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,143
mixed to make pretty big sounding in Dolby Atmos.

880
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:20,825
We work with Dolby and they kind of help us out a little bit with that.

881
00:57:20,825 --> 00:57:27,109
But really the game itself, most of the assets in our game are either mono or stereo.

882
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:30,812
And like, if you have a surround sound setup at your house,

883
00:57:30,812 --> 00:57:34,695
basically the game engine kind of gives you a lot of stuff for free

884
00:57:34,695 --> 00:57:36,837
because it's all 3D audio and like, you know,

885
00:57:36,837 --> 00:57:41,180
the 3D audio just kind of gets baked into what we're doing already in the game

886
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:44,002
with setting attenuation values and things like that.

887
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:47,905
There's usually, whenever we want to really, really accentuate,

888
00:57:49,746 --> 00:57:53,929
like the surround sound, we do it very, very deliberately

889
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:55,650
for a very particular type of asset

890
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:57,611
that we think will get noticed,

891
00:57:57,611 --> 00:58:01,433
but it's a little bit less common for sure.

892
00:58:01,433 --> 00:58:02,114
Okay, thank you.

893
00:58:02,114 --> 00:58:04,575
We have about three minutes.

894
00:58:04,575 --> 00:58:09,538
Hello, thank you for coming here and talking.

895
00:58:09,538 --> 00:58:13,040
Does the modular system change the approach

896
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,902
that you take when sort of designing

897
00:58:15,902 --> 00:58:17,723
the more synthetic sounds and...

898
00:58:19,144 --> 00:58:20,665
How so?

899
00:58:20,665 --> 00:58:26,709
Yeah, it totally does because usually, you know, it, you know, be like,

900
00:58:26,709 --> 00:58:30,771
whenever I was working on the modular system, it just, I hated it at first

901
00:58:30,771 --> 00:58:35,194
because I, I missed just being able to just make the sound in my DAW and hope

902
00:58:35,194 --> 00:58:38,676
and just make it sound good in the DAW and then put it in the game and make

903
00:58:38,676 --> 00:58:40,057
tweaks from there, but, um.

904
00:58:41,057 --> 00:58:48,406
Yeah, it was really tough. You have to kind of make things that don't sound as great in the DAW.

905
00:58:48,406 --> 00:58:51,670
When you're working in the system, you have to kind of make something that sounds

906
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:55,535
like a layer of something that you would make, and then you have to put it in Wwise and then

907
00:58:55,535 --> 00:58:56,336
put it in the engine.

908
00:58:56,707 --> 00:58:59,887
and then you would have to test it against all the other layers that you're doing.

909
00:58:59,887 --> 00:59:05,308
So the approach basically, you start to make things a lot more piecemeal that way.

910
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:10,149
So you'll make like a transient layer, or you'll make mechanical layers,

911
00:59:10,149 --> 00:59:15,550
or like you'll have layers that are like with the Malaywan sniper rifles that are just more synthetic,

912
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:21,472
or a layer that might be more meant to be more like your low-end thump or something like that.

913
00:59:21,472 --> 00:59:23,592
And then it takes a lot of experimentation, but...

914
00:59:23,892 --> 00:59:28,134
It's extremely rewarding when you get it working right finally.

915
00:59:28,134 --> 00:59:33,116
But yeah, every sound designer kind of approaches it in their own unique way.

916
00:59:33,116 --> 00:59:33,837
For sure. Thank you.

917
00:59:33,837 --> 00:59:41,340
So I think you may have actually answered this question already when you said that all the content was created in a DAW.

918
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:49,284
But I was wondering if any of the synthesis, like the shock synth source and the sweetener layer for the crits

919
00:59:49,284 --> 00:59:51,725
came from Unreal's built-in synthesis rather than from a plugin?

920
00:59:52,186 --> 00:59:56,209
No, we have not been using Unreal's built-in synthesis at all.

921
00:59:56,209 --> 00:59:56,609
Oh, okay.

922
00:59:56,609 --> 00:59:56,890
Yeah.

923
00:59:56,890 --> 01:00:04,615
But pretty much a lot of the stuff that we do is either, if it's like a tool that we

924
01:00:04,615 --> 01:00:08,078
use that's playing live in the background, it's usually like...

925
01:00:09,445 --> 01:00:12,486
Like convolution reverb is a big example of that.

926
01:00:12,486 --> 01:00:15,027
Like we use that, we have a whole,

927
01:00:15,027 --> 01:00:17,087
I can do a whole nother talk on Triton,

928
01:00:17,087 --> 01:00:20,548
which is our occlusion and reverb system in the game.

929
01:00:20,548 --> 01:00:22,768
And we have compressors and limiters

930
01:00:22,768 --> 01:00:25,289
and things like that that run in the background via Wwise.

931
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:30,030
In these games, a lot of the synthesis that you're hearing

932
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,730
was created in a DAW, printed,

933
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:33,631
and then made into a WAV file essentially.

934
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:35,451
Oh, perfect, thank you, thank you.

935
01:00:36,098 --> 01:00:37,339
Hey, thank you all so much for coming.

936
01:00:37,339 --> 01:00:37,879
It is 1149.

937
01:00:37,879 --> 01:00:40,540
We did it, we did it.

938
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:48,942
We're having, if you'll have additional questions,

939
01:00:48,942 --> 01:00:52,083
we're having a lunchtime surgeries thing,

940
01:00:52,083 --> 01:00:53,844
and I forgot what room it's in.

941
01:00:53,844 --> 01:00:56,724
It's a few rooms down.

942
01:00:56,724 --> 01:00:57,585
Yeah, well.

943
01:00:59,842 --> 01:01:00,042
The 3014?

944
01:01:00,042 --> 01:01:02,423
Yeah, at 3014, it's gonna be myself,

945
01:01:02,423 --> 01:01:07,606
some other sound designers, or sound people in the industry.

946
01:01:07,606 --> 01:01:10,627
We're gonna be chillin' at tables,

947
01:01:10,627 --> 01:01:12,868
having one-on-one conversations with people.

948
01:01:12,868 --> 01:01:14,809
So if y'all wanna come to that,

949
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:16,430
that's just right down there, the 3014. ♪♪
