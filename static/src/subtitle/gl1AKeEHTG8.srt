00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,172
Hi everyone, my name is Yaji. I'm the general manager of the O-Pixels brand of Streamline

2
00:00:17,212 --> 00:00:22,695
Media Group. So O-Pixels is one of the brands on the Streamline Media Group umbrella that

3
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:26,176
focuses and specializes in large-scale 3D production.

4
00:00:28,538 --> 00:00:34,084
I, a bit of a personal introduction, I entered video games as a bilingual project manager

5
00:00:34,104 --> 00:00:42,274
and I worked on projects such as Street Fighter 5, Little Nightmares 2, before I had the opportunity

6
00:00:42,394 --> 00:00:48,581
to grow a new brand together with the Streamline Media Group as a general manager called All Pixels.

7
00:00:50,303 --> 00:00:58,470
And naturally during it was a big shift to going from a project manager to a general manager running a brand.

8
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:05,336
And it was a total paradigm shift between being very milestone and project focused.

9
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:13,123
So single project focused to looking at long term and teams focus in terms of longevity.

10
00:01:14,604 --> 00:01:20,707
And it was a huge shift in mindset that was, of course, disorienting at first,

11
00:01:21,027 --> 00:01:26,810
but it was a very enjoyable experience having the opportunity to learn and experiment with different

12
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:34,573
configurations of teams. And it naturally led me to really think about what makes teams resilient

13
00:01:34,593 --> 00:01:40,536
in the long term, what makes business resilient in the long term. So a lot about business continuity.

14
00:01:42,437 --> 00:01:46,118
And the reason that I chose this topic for GDC 2021

15
00:01:46,358 --> 00:01:48,738
is because it's not only beneficial for the business

16
00:01:48,798 --> 00:01:50,839
owners to have this understanding or bigger

17
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,600
context of what's needed to keep the teams running

18
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,760
resilient in the long term, but I

19
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,441
thought it would be also beneficial for producers

20
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:04,222
and project managers who don't really have the opportunity

21
00:02:04,302 --> 00:02:08,743
to run businesses from A to Z necessarily on a daily basis

22
00:02:09,243 --> 00:02:11,203
to have this bigger context as their.

23
00:02:12,504 --> 00:02:15,326
running their day-to-day, the ins and outs of production.

24
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:19,169
It definitely gives you a new eyesight and a paradigm

25
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:22,812
to look at different things as you are problem solving

26
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:26,455
because project management is a continuation

27
00:02:26,495 --> 00:02:29,018
of problem solving on a daily basis,

28
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:31,800
which is why I chose this topic.

29
00:02:34,762 --> 00:02:34,922
So.

30
00:02:36,385 --> 00:02:42,338
Going into the next slide, why focus on resilience?

31
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:42,980
Well.

32
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:51,398
Game development scene is suffering a lot from issues such as high turnover, burnouts,

33
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:57,342
mental health issues, all of which has come to the surface a lot during this pandemic.

34
00:02:57,923 --> 00:03:02,346
And there's definitely a lot of eyes on us and how we do things here.

35
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:08,931
There's a lot of scrutiny. And it's easy to think that it's all because of, you know,

36
00:03:09,271 --> 00:03:10,572
the pandemic, the coronavirus.

37
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:15,577
people being stuck at home, yes, to a degree has a factor.

38
00:03:15,597 --> 00:03:19,781
And I think it has accelerated a lot of these issues to the surface again.

39
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:24,546
But we have to remember that these are the the issues that we have

40
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:27,448
and the challenges that we have always been facing as an industry

41
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:30,391
that was prevalent all the way throughout.

42
00:03:31,876 --> 00:03:39,608
So and I thought it was very unfortunate because a lot of people who come into this industry,

43
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:44,535
they come into it out of passion and love for craft and for games.

44
00:03:45,714 --> 00:03:51,960
And naturally that made me really think about, okay, I am running a brand that focuses on large scale production.

45
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,663
How do I keep this large team resilient over time?

46
00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:03,990
And how do I keep teams that wants to grow their career in games and not necessarily get burned out after two to three years?

47
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:13,418
And how do I figure that so that we're not just set up for a single success or a single title success or a single product success?

48
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:20,109
or single milestone or project success but rather business continuity and how we can

49
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:24,016
all win together as a team so in terms of career growth.

50
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,764
And my values is aligned with the Streamline Media Group's value.

51
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:39,389
The company mission here is that we're building, our mission is to build a place where the creators

52
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,013
and the fans can come together and make a living out of their passion and make a living out of

53
00:04:45,614 --> 00:04:48,696
the game, the joys of making game. And

54
00:04:50,595 --> 00:04:53,717
that aligned and we're on the same page very fortunately.

55
00:04:54,558 --> 00:04:57,760
And as a result, I had a lot of opportunities to

56
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,262
experiment and have fun with,

57
00:05:01,743 --> 00:05:04,905
okay, how do I configure everything so that our team

58
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:08,808
doesn't get burned out after two to three years? So it's not just about

59
00:05:08,988 --> 00:05:12,370
winning in the short term, winning this milestone or winning this project,

60
00:05:12,871 --> 00:05:17,734
but us being together and surviving this and being resilient

61
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:19,355
together in the long term.

62
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:26,598
So Streamline was founded in 2001 in Amsterdam in an apartment in Amsterdam.

63
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,159
I think that's a.

64
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:30,495
a story that a lot of the indie developers share.

65
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:35,176
But I think what's what really set Streamline apart for me

66
00:05:35,676 --> 00:05:37,057
was that they have survived for 20 years,

67
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:41,338
which in other industries, it may not be much.

68
00:05:41,518 --> 00:05:46,579
But I think in games, after five, six years of being in games as a company,

69
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:49,820
you're considered one of the fossils, which is hilarious,

70
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,081
but also very unfortunate at the same time, because it points to the fact

71
00:05:53,141 --> 00:05:56,522
that not many businesses and not many teams survive.

72
00:05:57,324 --> 00:06:01,764
after their initial passion or initial fire has died down.

73
00:06:02,955 --> 00:06:06,076
Streamline has gone through throughout the 20 years,

74
00:06:06,857 --> 00:06:07,837
multiple changes.

75
00:06:08,257 --> 00:06:10,358
We have gone through the changes in technology,

76
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:13,580
changes in console cycles, economic downfalls, 9-11,

77
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,161
global pandemics, global drama.

78
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:18,662
And it was our resilience that has

79
00:06:18,782 --> 00:06:21,343
made us survive in all of those challenges.

80
00:06:21,644 --> 00:06:24,145
And not only survive, but thrive in all of those challenges.

81
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:27,646
Continuing to build a product and publish products,

82
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:29,887
continuing to not only

83
00:06:31,204 --> 00:06:37,337
adapt to different ecosystems but actually build the ecosystem called games combining

84
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:39,883
the media and technology together in our scene.

85
00:06:43,218 --> 00:06:48,500
So as we were going through that journey as a game developer,

86
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,782
we have started out at one point as a service provider,

87
00:06:52,422 --> 00:06:54,943
and we're now a game developer and a publisher as well.

88
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:57,043
So throughout that journey, we have definitely

89
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,865
learned how to retain talents, how to attract and grow

90
00:07:00,905 --> 00:07:01,505
top talents.

91
00:07:02,946 --> 00:07:08,487
how to be creative. I think creative is creativity is the word that's overlooked a lot of times

92
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:15,290
and are very kind of focused a lot in terms of art and design when we talk about creativity

93
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,611
but creativity and how we do business and how we do processes how we build teams.

94
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:27,497
is a thing that we have learned throughout our 20 years of journey as well. And of course,

95
00:07:27,517 --> 00:07:33,421
how to do crisis management, which was proven very successful. My team and Streamliner has

96
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:37,884
definitely surprised me in the last year as we went through the pandemic together.

97
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:45,389
And of course, business continuity. How do we continue leading the industry? How do we continue

98
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:50,492
building the ecosystem and not just following what's set out there and building our own paths?

99
00:07:54,428 --> 00:08:00,353
So taking a step back, resilience, I think there's many layers of resilience.

100
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,354
There's, of course, individual resilience.

101
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:08,319
And when I refer to individual resilience, it's talking about VUCA tolerant individuals.

102
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,563
VUCA is, of course, a military term that's used to describe a volatile, uncertain,

103
00:08:14,344 --> 00:08:20,709
complex and ambiguous situations that we like to use here as well, because that's how it feels like sometimes building games.

104
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:27,449
And these VUCA-tolerant individuals are characterized often by very high emotional intelligence

105
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:34,256
and their desires to introspect and really understand who they are, where their place

106
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:38,139
in the world is, what they're motivated by, what drives them, what gives them purpose.

107
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,483
And these individuals are often very value-oriented.

108
00:08:42,764 --> 00:08:44,826
If they believe in something, they'll stand up for something.

109
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:53,605
And these individuals are very resilient individuals and they will pursue what they want to pursue in their lives.

110
00:08:56,588 --> 00:09:06,776
But then comes a second layer of resilience called team resilience, because it doesn't mean that you have 20, 30 very resilient, very VUCA tolerant individuals.

111
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:09,709
and your team's automatically resilient.

112
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:13,890
Because no one can be resilient 100% of the times.

113
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:16,832
But that's how it feels like, you know,

114
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:18,752
being in this industry sometimes.

115
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:20,753
You would have moments of,

116
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:23,054
where you fall off the wagon, but.

117
00:09:26,558 --> 00:09:31,002
without the team around you to support you and kind of bring you out of there,

118
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:35,847
it sometimes feels like you're not able to go through it, no matter how resilient you are.

119
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:42,253
So that's really all about team resilience. It's about building the support network and

120
00:09:42,273 --> 00:09:47,217
the relationship and the structures to help these individuals through their ups and downs.

121
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,119
Of course, everyone has ups and downs.

122
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:56,491
but kind of shortening their downs, the duration of the downs, so that they're able to rise up

123
00:09:56,531 --> 00:10:01,138
quickly and get back to it through the help and support of their teams.

124
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:08,447
So this is built by creating opportunities for teams to have real conversations.

125
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:15,850
And when I say real conversations, I'm talking about really frank and honest conversations about themselves as humans.

126
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:21,612
And also, you know, they're about their performance, about their work, about their feelings and emotions.

127
00:10:22,506 --> 00:10:33,074
So I'll talk a little bit more later about the exact examples of what kind of meetings we create or what kind of opportunities we create to do this.

128
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:36,356
But that is essentially what team resilience is.

129
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:43,104
And then comes organizational resilience, which is a little bit more complicated

130
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:44,885
compared to the team resilience.

131
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:52,030
So again, just because you have individuals who are resilient or teams, even teams

132
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,913
who are resilient doesn't mean that your organization's automatically going to

133
00:10:55,953 --> 00:11:00,316
survive and you have business continuity for years to come.

134
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:10,355
Organizational resilience, it's all about building the infrastructure to allow your business to evolve organically.

135
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:18,985
So there's a lot of words in there. But when I say evolve organically, we all have sparks of ingenuities or ideas.

136
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,145
and even more so individual resilience who are able to work as a team

137
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:27,248
because they're constantly talking to each other, inspiring each other,

138
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:32,034
generating new ideas, new way of doing things, new way of doing business, new way

139
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:36,260
of doing processes or creating art or new way of

140
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,082
creating games.

141
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,722
So unless your business is able to capture those ideas

142
00:11:43,902 --> 00:11:45,903
and turn them into actual outcomes,

143
00:11:45,943 --> 00:11:51,807
turn them into actual products or processes or business

144
00:11:51,847 --> 00:11:57,490
services or business proposals, these ideas stay as ideas.

145
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:02,733
And these resilient teams and resilient individuals

146
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:04,114
constantly need.

147
00:12:06,163 --> 00:12:08,306
to see outcomes of their work.

148
00:12:08,747 --> 00:12:12,834
So unless their conversations and their sparks of ideas

149
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:18,103
turn into actual actionable items that gets passed

150
00:12:19,024 --> 00:12:20,106
and that

151
00:12:21,005 --> 00:12:24,867
gets passed and turns into an action within their organization,

152
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:29,449
they're not necessarily going to feel happy in your organization.

153
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:33,730
So these creative and very diverse and inspired teams

154
00:12:34,891 --> 00:12:38,972
need to feel, well need to actually contribute to evolving your business

155
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:44,094
model and evolving your products, evolving how you do things to move your

156
00:12:44,114 --> 00:12:44,795
business forward.

157
00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:48,757
then only they'll feel like I'm in an environment where I can succeed.

158
00:12:49,197 --> 00:12:51,539
I'm in an environment where I feel like I have a purpose

159
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:54,761
and I'm in an environment where I feel like I'm growing.

160
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:58,884
So this is, in a sense,

161
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,467
what it means to be resilient on many different layers.

162
00:13:04,527 --> 00:13:07,609
And now I'm going to go into different examples or case studies

163
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,470
of what I mean by these.

164
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:16,091
So first, individual resilience, of course,

165
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:21,074
a huge thing would be making sure that your hiring process

166
00:13:21,194 --> 00:13:24,477
is designed to find and hire these VOCA tolerant

167
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:27,099
and high emotional intelligence people.

168
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:32,122
And I call this process as finding the gems

169
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:36,345
because it's really that, it's going through

170
00:13:36,465 --> 00:13:38,367
and finding the people who sparks

171
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:40,668
and shines within your team.

172
00:13:42,138 --> 00:13:45,441
and being open to find them because it will take a while sometimes.

173
00:13:46,462 --> 00:13:50,706
And it all starts with removing prerequisites that narrow down the

174
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:54,970
diversity pool. And when I talk about diversity, a lot

175
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,633
of people are very concerned or they're

176
00:13:59,614 --> 00:14:00,915
they feel like it's a huge challenge.

177
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:07,057
because they think they tell me like, oh, you know, when I talk about diversity,

178
00:14:07,077 --> 00:14:11,681
I really, I really just want to focus on, you know, their skills or their merits

179
00:14:12,042 --> 00:14:16,566
rather than looking to hire for the sake of hiring diverse groups.

180
00:14:18,621 --> 00:14:24,144
Diversity doesn't just necessarily mean backgrounds and gender as well though.

181
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:30,488
It means that you're open to removing barriers that block particular groups of people from

182
00:14:30,588 --> 00:14:31,749
entering your space.

183
00:14:33,597 --> 00:14:41,324
And for us, it means that removing any prerequisites such as you need to have a game degree or game

184
00:14:41,364 --> 00:14:45,527
backgrounds to be able to work with us, or you need to have a certain amount of experience to

185
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:51,953
be able to work with us. Our team comes from all walks of life. And when I say all walks of life,

186
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,595
I mean I have producers who

187
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:57,540
Actually myself majored in science,

188
00:14:58,361 --> 00:14:59,984
producers who majored in finance,

189
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:03,231
I've leads and artists who have majored in finance,

190
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:04,994
have decided to take up art,

191
00:15:05,395 --> 00:15:07,559
have studied on their own and entered the space.

192
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:16,073
people from hospitality, entertainment, and all of that links back to resilient individuals

193
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:21,677
because oftentimes these people have tried and tested many different things in their

194
00:15:21,717 --> 00:15:27,180
lives in search of what they like or what drives them forward.

195
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,064
And having this experience of having gone through this thought process or this

196
00:15:35,152 --> 00:15:43,338
process of finding their purpose in life, it automatically gives them the resilience

197
00:15:43,439 --> 00:15:50,524
because they have already tried and tested many things. They are proactive and they're looking for

198
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:54,527
what, continuously looking for what they like and they're always thinking about, you know,

199
00:15:54,727 --> 00:15:58,850
what their purpose is and what drives them forward.

200
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:04,037
onboarding these individuals who have this mindset into your team

201
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,120
would bring you this huge diverse background

202
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:11,183
that and experience that follows them into

203
00:16:11,343 --> 00:16:16,307
your pool of solutions, finding solutions. So when you're

204
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:21,591
even when you're looking at trying to solve a resource problem or

205
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:23,332
trying to solve a milestone problem

206
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:28,470
Having people that have thought from multiple different angles,

207
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,432
who have different contexts, different backgrounds,

208
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:34,655
that adds a lot to your solutions pool

209
00:16:34,715 --> 00:16:35,996
and how you look at different things,

210
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:41,480
how you're approaching a certain issue or question,

211
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,262
which is why we always welcome diverse teams.

212
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:54,524
Also, our interviews are very focused on and designed to have very open and frank conversations about who they are and their values,

213
00:16:55,565 --> 00:17:03,791
not just about what they have done before, what their skills are, what are the responsibilities and duties you have carried out in your previous workplace,

214
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:10,495
but focused, especially in the last interview, a lot on who are you as a human and what are you looking for?

215
00:17:10,555 --> 00:17:14,878
And what are you trying to achieve by joining this group called Streamline over here?

216
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:17,885
Um, and.

217
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,560
That leads to the next point, which is the open applications.

218
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,281
What we found is that a lot of the times

219
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,562
these individuals, these gems that we're looking for

220
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:33,943
who are resilient often come through interesting routes.

221
00:17:34,243 --> 00:17:37,924
They don't they usually apply for one thing and end up in another place

222
00:17:37,964 --> 00:17:41,185
because through the interview process, we have found that, oh, perhaps

223
00:17:41,225 --> 00:17:42,965
this person could be interesting for this team

224
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,626
or perhaps this person is what you're looking for.

225
00:17:45,706 --> 00:17:48,246
And we refer them a lot between the departments.

226
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:56,501
So OpenApplication is exactly that, designed to catch people who may not exactly know what they want to do.

227
00:17:57,617 --> 00:18:01,719
or may not exactly have an idea that I want to apply for exactly for this role,

228
00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:05,041
but they know that they want to join us here at Streamline

229
00:18:05,801 --> 00:18:09,323
or they know that they want to join the games industry or the creative industry,

230
00:18:09,643 --> 00:18:12,905
but they don't simply know how to start or they don't quite know

231
00:18:13,245 --> 00:18:14,125
what is their best fit.

232
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:18,828
So open applications is designed to catch those.

233
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:23,530
And that, as a result, will immediately open up

234
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,912
and widen your pool that you're looking at to grow your team.

235
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:28,490
and grow your resilient team.

236
00:18:33,617 --> 00:18:36,621
So next up is team resilience.

237
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:40,245
So now that you have been resilient individuals,

238
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:41,326
it's about retaining them.

239
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,568
It's about

240
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:49,701
retaining them and building relationships and networks and support systems around them.

241
00:18:50,802 --> 00:18:57,508
And as I talked about this before, it really just comes down to getting them ready and

242
00:18:57,548 --> 00:19:02,473
building their muscles for VUCA situations before the situation gets VUCA.

243
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:09,042
What I mean by that is, for example, before things get hectic, having regular one-on-ones

244
00:19:10,022 --> 00:19:15,264
or organizing roundtable discussions or book clubs and lunch and learns where people are

245
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:21,267
able to share ideas and share their emotions, share how they're feeling or share their opinions

246
00:19:21,867 --> 00:19:23,548
freely before things get stressful.

247
00:19:24,568 --> 00:19:28,150
That way they get into the habit of sharing, they get into the habit of

248
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:32,111
knowing each other and giving each other benefit of the doubt

249
00:19:32,512 --> 00:19:36,394
when things get stressful. And that really helps build that resilient

250
00:19:36,414 --> 00:19:38,675
muscles when things get crazy.

251
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:46,074
So regular one-on-ones is something that we do here in all levels, regardless of who you are,

252
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:52,617
as an artist, as a lead, as a director, as a C-suit.

253
00:19:53,557 --> 00:19:59,599
All managers and teams have regular one-on-ones with each other for this purpose,

254
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:03,421
talking about their personal goals, their strengths and their motivators,

255
00:20:03,481 --> 00:20:05,161
and most importantly, their fears.

256
00:20:05,521 --> 00:20:06,602
You know, what makes them tick?

257
00:20:06,762 --> 00:20:07,442
What makes them tick?

258
00:20:08,322 --> 00:20:14,965
afraid because a lot of the times when a VUCA situation hits, our lizard brain comes out

259
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:21,147
and we react. So unless you have that built that emotional trust bank with each other,

260
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:27,749
it is very easy to misunderstand each other and that often leads to teams falling out

261
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:29,410
and individuals.

262
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,079
not being able to be resilient in those situations.

263
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,941
So all of these sessions are designed for that purpose.

264
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:42,503
Even though they may not always be talking about emotions or feelings,

265
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:44,904
it's a practice of getting them to talk to each other

266
00:20:45,464 --> 00:20:50,286
and share opinions and actually argue before things get stressful.

267
00:20:51,815 --> 00:20:54,897
One example of that is what we call the NPS.

268
00:20:55,057 --> 00:20:59,740
It's a net promoter score that all managers and leads give to each other

269
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,681
on a weekly basis.

270
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:05,944
So we'll be evaluating our week and saying,

271
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:09,786
oh, my week was give a score out of 10.

272
00:21:09,826 --> 00:21:15,690
And we'll highlight any low scores or high scores during a meeting as well

273
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,911
so that individuals are able to share.

274
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:24,204
what made that week particularly good or particularly bad so that we're able to celebrate

275
00:21:24,224 --> 00:21:33,266
the wins together and as well as share any particular downfalls or fallouts that they've had

276
00:21:34,346 --> 00:21:38,507
and if there's any still any elephants in the room that meeting is exactly

277
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:42,948
there for people to you know talk it out and before they wrap up the week.

278
00:21:44,472 --> 00:21:50,494
So all of these things are designed to get people to know each other like human to human.

279
00:21:50,774 --> 00:21:56,595
And I think that's especially important as we as an industry, as we adopt this hybrid

280
00:21:56,635 --> 00:21:59,296
model of working from home and working from the office.

281
00:22:00,156 --> 00:22:07,738
You know, when you're not able to talk in person, these exercises or memories or muscle

282
00:22:07,758 --> 00:22:13,399
memories of having done this will really pay off when things get stressful or when situations

283
00:22:13,459 --> 00:22:14,379
turn abooka.

284
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:25,567
Next up is organizational resilience. So now that you have an individual who is resilient

285
00:22:26,268 --> 00:22:31,412
and they are supported by other individuals who are resilient in a team network.

286
00:22:33,301 --> 00:22:35,203
It's about creating an environment.

287
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:39,326
I would like to use the analogy called greenhouse, right?

288
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:44,210
If you want to grow certain types of plants or certain types of cactus,

289
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,093
you need to recreate their optimum environment.

290
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:51,116
So the optimum environment for these vocal tolerant

291
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:56,420
and resilient individuals and teams who have high emotional intelligence,

292
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,442
who is very self-aware.

293
00:23:00,117 --> 00:23:03,460
is to allow them to create their own career paths,

294
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,142
because that's what led them here in the first place.

295
00:23:06,342 --> 00:23:08,624
So why not let them continue their paths?

296
00:23:09,745 --> 00:23:12,347
This can mean internal career growth,

297
00:23:12,687 --> 00:23:14,889
but this can sometimes also mean external career growth.

298
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,772
We celebrate people when they get a promotion

299
00:23:18,892 --> 00:23:22,615
or they find opportunities outside of our organization,

300
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:26,218
if it means that they're able to pursue their career paths

301
00:23:26,298 --> 00:23:28,880
or pursue their goals that they have always had in mind.

302
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:38,561
Also, it means that deliberately building our business with contingency and space for innovation, growth and experiments.

303
00:23:39,582 --> 00:23:46,506
So I myself is one of the experiments that I'm referring to here.

304
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,107
In 2018, we have introduced the brands.

305
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:53,292
all pixels being one of them, in order to diversify our revenue,

306
00:23:53,952 --> 00:23:59,034
revenue streams and customer based. So we used to do things all as a group

307
00:23:59,114 --> 00:24:03,575
called under streamlined studios. We used to do pretty much A to Z

308
00:24:03,815 --> 00:24:07,317
of video game development under one studio.

309
00:24:08,117 --> 00:24:08,857
But we have

310
00:24:10,854 --> 00:24:16,256
We have created these different diverse brands as you can see here in the screen.

311
00:24:17,677 --> 00:24:26,020
We have split out our brands and created the new ones to be able to focus and create their own

312
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:31,862
business paths into different areas of not only video games but in entertainment,

313
00:24:33,083 --> 00:24:34,323
media and technology in general.

314
00:24:35,979 --> 00:24:44,542
So as you can see here, when your business is diversified as this, it creates a safe network

315
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:52,766
and what we call geometric growth. It means that if one brand is able to grow,

316
00:24:54,046 --> 00:24:59,528
it doesn't mean that their setback is immediately reflected on your business as a total, but you

317
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:04,070
still have other supporting pillars who is able to continue their operations regardless.

318
00:25:05,082 --> 00:25:12,224
So this diversity, again, is what creates a safe network for you to for you as stakeholders,

319
00:25:12,324 --> 00:25:21,027
shareholders or founders to have a much more receptive mindset and an attitude to anything

320
00:25:21,047 --> 00:25:22,787
that comes up within your organization.

321
00:25:23,127 --> 00:25:24,448
Because we are humans, too.

322
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:31,450
And it doesn't matter how much high potential your team is or how much potential your team

323
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,551
has, if all of those ideas are going to be.

324
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:40,625
ignored or not taken up because you're too afraid that it will affect the business.

325
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,869
So it's all about creating the diversity and also creating that flat hierarchy

326
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:50,632
and being comfortable to hand over that decision making

327
00:25:50,913 --> 00:25:55,676
power and control to areas where it's needed

328
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:59,499
and those who are able to make those decisions on a daily basis.

329
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:07,028
and allowing those individual decision makers to really shape your business

330
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:10,833
as part of being as part of your team.

331
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:20,063
So to summarize this, going back to the previous slide,

332
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:23,804
to summarize this, it's all about, yes,

333
00:26:23,924 --> 00:26:26,646
finding resilience and creating an environment,

334
00:26:27,246 --> 00:26:31,068
creating a team where they're able to self-introspect,

335
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:36,990
self-reflect, and really talk about their goal as a human.

336
00:26:37,658 --> 00:26:41,662
and really allowing them to build a rapport between the teams.

337
00:26:42,202 --> 00:26:44,144
So again, creating that team resilience.

338
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:48,188
But at the same time, you as an organization

339
00:26:48,668 --> 00:26:55,835
being able to have that infrastructure where you're able to capture all of those individual sparks.

340
00:26:57,256 --> 00:27:03,158
of these very resilient individuals and turn that into actual business ideas or business proposals

341
00:27:03,858 --> 00:27:10,561
that shapes your business forward and shapes the ecosystem and the industry forward. So it's

342
00:27:10,621 --> 00:27:17,304
all about creating an environment and creating an environment where you're able to

343
00:27:17,424 --> 00:27:24,867
not only hire and attract but retain those high EQ and VOCA tolerant individuals within your

344
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:25,508
organization.

345
00:27:28,097 --> 00:27:35,179
And a lot of this can be applied, as I said, to your individual projects management when you're

346
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:42,241
doing problem solving. It is a new way of looking at things. It's not just individual wins or short

347
00:27:42,281 --> 00:27:49,564
term wins of, you know, making our milestone this month or making our project or game this year,

348
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:56,966
but all about, okay, how do I make a decision that will affect the team positively in the long term?

349
00:27:58,706 --> 00:28:10,440
Alright, so that is it. If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments. I'll be able to go through them in the live Q&A session afterwards. Thank you very much for tuning in.
