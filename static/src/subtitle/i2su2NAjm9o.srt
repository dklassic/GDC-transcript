00:00:28,952 --> 00:00:33,535
Hello and welcome to the 23rd Annual Independent Games Festival Awards,

2
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:37,118
and also the second official digital version of the awards ceremony.

3
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:41,020
I'm your chairman, Kelly Wallach, and yeah, it's been a year.

4
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,464
It's definitely been a year, and you know, we miss you all so much,

5
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:49,426
but it's been really lovely to stay connected through all of the games,

6
00:00:49,426 --> 00:00:52,128
and all the work, and the contribution that folks put into

7
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:53,709
keeping the IGF alive this year.

8
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:56,911
So I really wanted to give a special thanks to all the judges,

9
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:58,592
and jury member, and the staff.

10
00:00:59,114 --> 00:01:03,495
who helped make this possible and also of course to everybody who sent us in their games.

11
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:06,676
It was a really, really great bunch of games this year.

12
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:12,397
So it was really heartwarming and lovely to see everyone's work that got submitted.

13
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:14,178
I also wanted to give a special thanks to ID at Xbox,

14
00:01:14,178 --> 00:01:19,439
who is our supporter for the IGF this year for making this all possible.

15
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,300
Yeah, and a big congratulations to all the finalists and nominees,

16
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,720
the honorable mentions and...

17
00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:26,209
Best of luck.

18
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:28,050
Really looking forward to seeing the winners

19
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,511
and to celebrating with you all.

20
00:01:29,511 --> 00:01:32,492
And hopefully we'll be able to see each other again

21
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,473
in person soon.

22
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:38,255
But until then, miss you, good luck, and enjoy the ceremony.

23
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:38,875
All right, bye.

24
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:47,861
Hi everyone, I'm Victoria Tran, Community Director at InnerSloth,

25
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:51,203
creators of Among Us and the Henry Stickmin Collection.

26
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:54,506
I am super honored to be your 2021 host for the IGF Awards this year,

27
00:01:54,506 --> 00:02:00,491
which, like most of life for the past while, has been all online.

28
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:06,935
So how do you start a speech about a year like this?

29
00:02:06,935 --> 00:02:08,977
Am I right? Am I right, everyone?

30
00:02:08,977 --> 00:02:11,699
This past year...

31
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:19,420
sucked in so many ways and I'm honestly a little bit afraid to celebrate and a little bit

32
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:25,994
afraid to do this because I don't know what to say to make it better and it feels almost

33
00:02:25,994 --> 00:02:31,799
disrespectful to be celebrating like this at a time when so many people have been through a lot,

34
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:37,063
are currently going through a lot, and have been ignored for so long. An award show won't mitigate

35
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:41,567
any of the pain that people have gone through and that we're still going through but I think there

36
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:42,408
is a certain...

37
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:46,748
type of power in being here, watching the awards show together.

38
00:02:46,748 --> 00:02:51,971
I genuinely hope that you can celebrate watching these awards with us and also just celebrate

39
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:56,514
where you are right now in moving forward and taking action as I've seen so much of

40
00:02:56,514 --> 00:03:01,797
the industry do, whether it was for Free Palestine, Black Lives Matter, or any of the other causes

41
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:02,918
that we've gathered for.

42
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:09,282
Especially as someone who works directly with players.

43
00:03:09,282 --> 00:03:10,543
Oh, I'm gonna cry.

44
00:03:10,543 --> 00:03:12,564
I have seen first hand.

45
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:24,591
Oh my god, how much you've changed their lives and how much you've saved them and how much you've saved me

46
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:24,752
um

47
00:03:24,752 --> 00:03:25,932
Ah, oh, sorry, okay

48
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:31,856
Staying hydrated is really important everyone

49
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:38,500
This is a celebration of indie games or as the epic and apple lawsuit called it

50
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:45,404
Items that are so offensive, we cannot speak about them here.

51
00:03:45,404 --> 00:03:50,748
Well, it's too bad that all games are cancelled now. I don't understand tech sometimes.

52
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:55,631
But look, I could go on and on, but this is a celebration of indie games and the nominees,

53
00:03:55,631 --> 00:04:01,095
and I cannot wait for you to see all the wonderful games and to see who takes home an award.

54
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:02,717
So let's just get the show on the road.

55
00:04:02,717 --> 00:04:08,741
To kick us off, we have the nominees for best

56
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:14,909
For Best Student Game, Student Gamers just remind us that, yep, they will always be more

57
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:20,751
talented than us, there are so many new ideas coming into the indie game space, and honestly,

58
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:22,871
I'm really grateful for that.

59
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:29,813
Make sure you pay attention to the nominees in this category, because this will be on

60
00:04:29,813 --> 00:04:30,553
the final exam.

61
00:04:30,553 --> 00:04:36,015

And we are so excited that you have selected us to win

82
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,652
this award for best student game.

83
00:06:35,652 --> 00:06:40,916
We'd like to extend thanks from our team who couldn't make it

84
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,718
today, Caleb, Travis, Nick, Kim, and Erica.

85
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:45,840
This was a labor of love.

86
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,922
It was the brainchild of one John's backstop.

87
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:50,284
And we all worked really hard to make that vision come true.

88
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:50,664
Hi, Mom.

89
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:55,208
Thank you so much for choosing us to be the best student game.

90
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,570
We wanted to make an intriguing game, something

91
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,153
that captures a little bit of the human experience

92
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,474
and morbid curiosity.

93
00:07:01,474 --> 00:07:03,255
We greatly appreciate your support.

94
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:06,938
We could not be more proud of our team

95
00:07:06,938 --> 00:07:09,341
and excited that you would honor us with this.

96
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,391
I know I'm not the only one that has appreciated a good soundtrack, especially while I'm working

97
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:20,092
and a boss battle song comes on and I'm like really productive.

98
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:26,394
All I'm saying is that audio can make or break a game, whether that's sound effects or the

99
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:28,614
OST or literally anything else.

100
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,035
So keep those ear balls...

101
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,055
Ear balls.

102
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:37,637

There it is.

119
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:34,144
Genesis Noir wouldn't work without the audio,

120
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:38,647
and we happen to think it's the best part of the game.

121
00:09:38,647 --> 00:09:40,428
We're so happy that you agree,

122
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:41,689
and thank you so much for this honor.

123
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:46,721
Yeah, Tom, Vincent, and Joe from Skillbard did all the music and sound design for the game,

124
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:51,685
and they worked tremendously hard to make everything sound really great, rich, and reactive.

125
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:54,687
Thanks for working with us, and you really helped take the game to the next level.

126

And the winner is... ... ... ...

147
00:12:18,526 --> 00:12:34,875
... ... ... Um, kia ora everyone. Uh, thank you for the win on the narrative award.

148
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:39,258
Uh, you know, I'm pretty blown away with that.

149
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,120
I think, you know, the game started with no story and then it, you know,

150
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,502
developed one along the way with sort of the environmental storytelling and that.

151
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:53,390
I think one thing I guess I would like to share around that is basically a little bit of a...

152
00:12:53,973 --> 00:13:00,496
a thing why I did that in the game and it's just I guess this this little frustration I have where

153
00:13:00,496 --> 00:13:06,439
a lot of times indies will make these really great ideas for stories and then or ideas for games where

154
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:12,022
the gameplay is just awesome and then it almost feels like you need to sort of tack on a story

155
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:17,524
that ends up being text-based which adds a lot of work and a lot of extra dev time and I think

156
00:13:17,524 --> 00:13:20,986
you know the reality with this game is you know

157
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:25,133
It won this award without any text at all.

158
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:28,998
And I think it's a kind of thing where I think, you know,

159
00:13:28,998 --> 00:13:31,442
we can all sort of start to think about

160
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:32,744
what stories mean in games

161
00:13:32,744 --> 00:13:35,908
and maybe try to explore different ways of telling them.

162
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:45,085
I want to thank Playism for taking the risk with us, being a new developer and all, but also

163
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:51,169
you know it was one of those moments where I could say things to them and they understood it

164
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:54,852
and I think that's just that shared cultural context around a lot of this stuff, but

165
00:13:54,852 --> 00:14:00,235
you know they took a risk with the sort of more indirect storytelling I wanted to do,

166
00:14:00,235 --> 00:14:03,698
not sort of spelling things out or

167
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,742
foreshadowing things too early and you know I'm sure everyone who's played it

168
00:14:08,742 --> 00:14:13,646
enjoys the story for that and I just want to say thank you to them for that

169
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:18,969
and I think it's one of those things where we've got more stories to tell in

170
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:26,874
the future so me and Thor and you know I think it's this kind of thing where you

171
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:29,676
know if stories are coming out of Lismore

172
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,091
You know, I think anything can be told, can't it?

173
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:34,351
Thank you.

174
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:39,694
So this next award is a little bit

175
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:42,515
like a popularity contest to whoever wins.

176
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:45,056
Congratulations, you're pretty popular.

177
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:46,917
There's a lot to be said for a game

178
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:49,018
that is able to create a really strong community

179
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:51,059
that cheers on its developers

180
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,679
and encourages others to do the same.

181
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:55,501
I'm a little bit biased because I work in community,

182
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:58,302
so I think it's really great that these things can happen.

183
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:12,691
And the winner is... ... ... ...

184
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:14,593
... ... Hello everyone,

185
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:16,695
I am Mateo Alaisa, I am the director

186
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:19,598
of Aarog, and I'm very honoured

187
00:15:19,598 --> 00:15:20,919
to receive this award

188
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,741
on behalf of the whole

189
00:15:22,741 --> 00:15:24,203
team of Hermanos Magia and

190
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:25,043
Leap Game Studios.

191
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:33,207
I must thank especially my team, the help I received from Luis Wong and Sol Sanchez,

192
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:37,411
as well as Gabriela Laisa and Vania Castagnino.

193
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:42,915
This is a very significant prize to all of us and for the industry in Peru.

194
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:49,039
We hope that we can still deliver these messages to you and to the world and keep talking about

195
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,341
deep meanings in games.

196
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:52,222
Thank you very much.

197
00:15:58,838 --> 00:15:59,519
Are you hydrating?

198
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,799
I wasn't joking.

199
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:06,841
Good design can make you see ordinary things

200
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,001
in new, fantastic ways,

201
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:12,142
like envisioning a conversation as a card battle

202
00:16:12,142 --> 00:16:16,244
or creating a genre called Sawcore.

203
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:17,364
Anything is up for grabs,

204
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:20,025
and we're all just players in their game.

205
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:22,145
These are your nominees for Best Game Design.

206
00:16:27,475 --> 00:16:32,857

Alan Hazelden, Benjamin Davis, Jamie Perconti

224
00:17:56,668 --> 00:18:06,813
And the winner is...

225
00:18:16,468 --> 00:18:21,189
I'm especially happy that we got the excellence in design, because Teardown started as a technology

226
00:18:21,189 --> 00:18:23,689
experiment with no particular game in mind at all.

227
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:30,971
And it took almost a full year of prototyping to come up with the right idea, find the right

228
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:33,272
setting and getting the design in place.

229
00:18:33,272 --> 00:18:38,253
It was a very long and bumpy road, and we almost gave up along the way, so thank you

230
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:44,014
everyone who saw the potential in this when it was just a bunch of videos on Twitter.

231
00:18:44,014 --> 00:18:46,315
Without your support, Teardown wouldn't exist.

232
00:18:47,403 --> 00:18:50,865
Also, huge congratulations to everyone on the team.

233
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:53,426
We're a very small group of developers,

234
00:18:53,426 --> 00:18:55,867
so everyone's contribution is really important.

235
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:58,589
Also, special thanks to all the fans,

236
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:00,790

237
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,471
and everyone else who made this possible.

238
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:04,232
Thank you.

239
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:09,955
Whether it's pixel, 2D, 3D, voxel,

240
00:19:09,955 --> 00:19:14,657
art is everything we imagined we would share with the world.

241
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:22,815
Great art can really pack a punch, whether it's in the first 15 seconds of a trailer

242
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:27,436
or within the hours and hours of gameplay.

243
00:19:27,436 --> 00:19:28,056
Oh gosh, um...

244
00:19:28,056 --> 00:19:32,997
These are your nominees for Best Visual Art.

257
00:21:30,261 --> 00:21:33,742
Creating the visual art of Genesis Noir was a huge technical and creative challenge,

We must thank Marcin, Pedro, Mercy, Dave, Audrey, and Mayo.

261
00:21:42,223 --> 00:21:46,444
You guys elevated the simple black and white art of Genesis Noir

262
00:21:46,444 --> 00:21:51,025
and filled in the Big Bang with detail and richness that I couldn't have done on my own.

263
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:53,705
Also huge thanks to Adria, Jeffrey, Stephen, and Sam

264
00:21:53,705 --> 00:21:57,186

We couldn't have done it without you guys.

Making Blaseball with this team.

315
00:25:44,746 --> 00:25:47,587

316

It was by no means a sure thing,

Thank you.

342
00:26:47,392 --> 00:26:53,175
Hi everyone, I'm extremely honored to present the Seamus McNally Grand Prize nominees for this year.

343
00:26:53,175 --> 00:26:58,398
Last year, I never expected to receive this award, and it meant so much to me to even be nominated for it.

344
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:03,180
Indie games have been a huge source of inspiration for me, ever since I discovered that they were a thing.

345
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:09,343
I remember thinking that it was incredible that one or two or a handful of people could put together a game

346
00:27:09,343 --> 00:27:13,645
and release it on their own without a huge studio or a ton of resources,

347
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:15,366
and thinking that maybe I could do that someday.

348
00:27:15,787 --> 00:27:20,669
And since then, game development has only become even more accessible, and we're just seeing so many more games.

349
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:23,091
Games that are willing to do things differently.

350
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:27,333
Games that are personal and human, and games that push the boundaries of what a game even is.

351
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:31,675
And this is the festival to celebrate and champion those games.

352
00:27:31,675 --> 00:27:36,498
So as someone who has always looked up to the games in this festival, it really is an honor to present the nominees.

353
00:27:36,498 --> 00:27:38,659
So without further ado, here they are.

354
00:27:46,524 --> 00:27:49,705
Seamus McNally Grand Prize.

355
00:27:49,705 --> 00:27:55,527
Paradise Killer, developed by Kaizen Gameworks.

356
00:27:55,527 --> 00:27:59,768
Ollie Clark Smith.

357
00:27:59,768 --> 00:28:04,369
Phil Crabtree.

358
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:05,549
Rachel Noy.

359
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:09,110
Teardown, developed by Tuxedo Labs.

360
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:30,448

361
00:28:30,448 --> 00:28:38,010
Genesis, developed by Carol.

362
00:28:49,713 --> 00:28:57,639
Umurangi Generation, developed by Origami Degro.

363
00:28:57,639 --> 00:29:05,146
Naftali Faulkner, Thor Heemster.

364
00:29:05,146 --> 00:29:08,388
Spirit Bearer, developed by Thunder Lotus.

365
00:29:08,388 --> 00:29:13,272
Nicolas Guerand, Joe Gauthier, Alex Boyer,

366
00:29:13,272 --> 00:29:18,157
Alexander Monette Martin.

367
00:29:25,005 --> 00:29:40,090
And the winner is...

368
00:29:55,423 --> 00:30:02,987
Anyway, I want to thank everyone today for the win on the grand prize at the IGF.

369
00:30:02,987 --> 00:30:09,270
This is a huge accomplishment that, you know, we're really happy to, like it's blown us away.

370
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:14,053
And when I say us, I mean, you know, me and Thor. Thor being the composer who totally smashed it

371
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:18,715
with the soundtrack, getting the tone of that right for the stuff he composed and

372
00:30:18,715 --> 00:30:24,918
just the general mood of the music. You know, I want to thank

373
00:30:25,515 --> 00:30:33,281
players as well with this. I think, you know, that they've been really able to sort of help

374
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:39,204
us move into the space. And, you know, I don't think it's a coincidence that we won this

375
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:44,028
with them because, like I would just say that there has been a lot of times where they've

376
00:30:44,028 --> 00:30:44,968
really helped me out.

377
00:30:45,914 --> 00:30:50,438
I've really not been afraid to ask questions and they've been able to provide me with all

378
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:52,079
the support on that.

379
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,540
So I want to really thank them.

380
00:30:53,540 --> 00:31:00,746
Just a car going past and I would just say it has been a really rough year for a lot

381
00:31:00,746 --> 00:31:01,246
of people.

382
00:31:01,246 --> 00:31:05,230
That's why I'm recording it outside so we can all remember what that looks like.

383
00:31:05,903 --> 00:31:13,530
But yeah, I'd like to thank not just Thor and Playism, but also my partner for putting up with my late hours.

384
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:23,057
I'd like to thank Professor Norm Sheen for sharing with me a different way of doing design, which ended up in forming this game.

385
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:30,742
I'd like to thank Julia Faulkner for, you know, sitting and painting with me all those times.

386
00:31:30,742 --> 00:31:34,284
And, you know, everyone else sort of met along the way.

387
00:31:34,284 --> 00:31:36,065
There's literally a giant list, you know.

388
00:31:36,065 --> 00:31:40,367
This is an indie game that was made by, you know, one to two people.

389
00:31:41,074 --> 00:31:47,999
But, you know, the people that we are, are always informed by the people we meet along the way.

390
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:51,541
So, you know, we never downplay in that respect.

391
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:56,285
So I'd just like to say once again, thank you for this grand prize win.

392
00:31:56,285 --> 00:31:58,727
And, you know, here's hoping for next time as well.

393
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:06,048
And that's it. We are at the end of the IGFs.

394
00:32:06,048 --> 00:32:08,729
Thank you for tuning in from wherever you are.

395
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:11,291
And to the winners, huge congratulations.

396
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:13,513
And to the nominees, huge congratulations.

397
00:32:13,513 --> 00:32:15,835
And to people who weren't even nominated.

398
00:32:16,508 --> 00:32:18,329
Also, giant congratulations.

399
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:21,011
Just take all the congratulations.

400
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:24,792
It takes a lot to put out a game and you did it.

401
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:27,974
But, but, but there are also a ton of people

402
00:32:27,974 --> 00:32:29,875
who aren't recognized at these awards.

403
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:33,236
So to all the people who do QA, community managers,

404
00:32:33,236 --> 00:32:36,938
localization, UI designers, moderators,

405
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:39,779
and everyone else who often gets overlooked in these things,

406
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,180
thank you for doing what you do.

407
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,320
You fricking rock.

408
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:48,543
We would all be perishing without you and I am very passionate about thanking you right now.

409
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:58,128
Have an award. Here you go. I'll photoshop an award right here. Or here. I'll photoshop two awards.

410
00:32:58,855 --> 00:33:04,318
that I guess I have to hand draw so that I don't run into any IP contractual errors.

411
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:07,060
Congratulations! You've won these awards!

412
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:11,182
And as a little bit of a parting message,

413
00:33:11,182 --> 00:33:13,524
I hope we all can continue creating a home for people.

414
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:18,967
And that we continue amplifying and supporting diverse stories and the people that make them.

415
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:21,909
To dream and care so much about the world you create.

416
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:24,370
Thank you for giving so many of us a home.

417
00:33:25,231 --> 00:33:29,572
And finally, a huge thank you to our IGF Platinum sponsor,

418
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:30,132
ID at Xbox.

419
00:33:30,132 --> 00:33:32,833
You make this all possible.

420
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:34,414
Thank you for supporting indies.

421
00:33:34,414 --> 00:33:35,554
Woo!

422
00:33:35,554 --> 00:33:38,315
We did it!

423
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:41,136
Ah!

424
00:33:41,136 --> 00:33:45,617
Bam!

425
00:33:45,617 --> 00:33:46,418
Hi there.

426
00:33:46,418 --> 00:33:48,518
I'm an exorbitantly paid Canadian

427
00:33:48,518 --> 00:33:51,339
with an overinflated sense of self-importance

428
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:54,800
here to host the industry's most important awards, which

429
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,100
No, not that one.

430
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,340
Oh, no, no.

431
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,721
I see now how that could have been confusing.

432
00:34:00,721 --> 00:34:01,542
OK, hang on.

433
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:02,502
I'll take it from the top.

434
00:34:02,502 --> 00:34:03,542
Hi, everyone.

435
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:07,643
I'm Sam Maggs, and welcome to the 21st Annual Game Developers

436
00:34:07,643 --> 00:34:08,884
Choice Awards.

437
00:34:08,884 --> 00:34:12,165
As a dev myself, I'm honored to be hosting these awards,

438
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:15,606
especially in a year when we needed games more than ever

439
00:34:15,606 --> 00:34:16,866
to help get us through quarantine.

440
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:20,567
Personally, my sanity was saved by phasmophobia,

441
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:21,908
no matter how ironic that may be.

442
00:34:22,558 --> 00:34:28,322
I also want to preface this ceremony by saying that while I understand that it might be uncomfortable

443
00:34:28,322 --> 00:34:35,087
or even confusing to see a woman on stage for the entirety of a gaming event, I have

444
00:34:35,087 --> 00:34:41,711
donned the customary blazer over graphic t-shirt in order to make everyone feel as at home

445
00:34:41,711 --> 00:34:42,391
as possible.

446
00:34:42,391 --> 00:34:47,615
I contemplated also being terrible at reading teleprompter, but then I remembered that I'm

447
00:34:47,615 --> 00:34:50,137
filming this in my own office and I don't have one, so.

448
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:52,473
This is as good as it's going to get.

449
00:34:52,473 --> 00:34:56,494
The GDC Awards are the premier accolades

450
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,574
for peer recognition in the games industry.

451
00:34:58,574 --> 00:35:01,495
And what's that?

452
00:35:01,495 --> 00:35:03,476
Marketing says we have to launch right now.

453
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,336
No, I thought we had another year in development.

454
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,777
The awards aren't ready to...

455
00:35:07,777 --> 00:35:08,557
You know what?

456
00:35:08,557 --> 00:35:09,537
We're fine.

457
00:35:09,537 --> 00:35:09,898
We're fine.

458
00:35:09,898 --> 00:35:10,678
One second.

459
00:35:29,643 --> 00:35:38,853
Yeah, we're ready. Let's go.

460
00:35:50,868 --> 00:35:53,189
Hi, hi, is this executive leadership?

461
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:54,209
Hi, yeah, it's Sam, the host.

462
00:35:54,209 --> 00:35:56,410
Yes, that's me, hi, hi.

463
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:00,090
I think there might've been a bit of a mix up.

464
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:05,291
See, we are here to celebrate games that already came out,

465
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:08,132
not to get hype over games that haven't come out yet.

466
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,512
You know, it just seems counterintuitive

467
00:36:09,512 --> 00:36:11,953
and maybe a little bit disrespectful to the whole.

468
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:14,373
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

469
00:36:15,397 --> 00:36:23,161
Yeah, yeah, I mean, obviously I want people to suck up to me and show me exclusives, but I'm not, you know, I...

470
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:24,742
No, no, no, no, I'm not being argumentative. I...

471
00:36:24,742 --> 00:36:29,924
No, I'm not getting emotional. I'm just a woman. This is just what my voice sounds like.

472
00:36:29,924 --> 00:36:32,746
No, I'm not not being a team player. I just...

473
00:36:32,746 --> 00:36:36,027
Yes, we will talk about this later.

474
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,968
Okay, uh, thanks so much.

475
00:36:36,968 --> 00:36:44,792
Um, uh, in the meantime, let's celebrate all the premieres that people loved that came out over this past year.

476
00:36:52,198 --> 00:36:52,979

Ian Mudd.

494
00:38:36,952 --> 00:38:40,994
No, no, I got it. I got it. Let's try it. I can do it in one. It's fine.

495
00:38:40,994 --> 00:38:41,275
Okay.

496
00:38:41,275 --> 00:38:41,895
Hmm.

497
00:38:41,895 --> 00:38:47,798
Our next award is absolutely poggers.

498
00:38:47,798 --> 00:38:49,999
These nominees dabbed on their competition.

499
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:54,382
So get ready to get gatchy hyper and spam Ws in chat for-

500
00:38:54,382 --> 00:38:56,383
No, I can't do it. I can't do it!

501
00:38:56,383 --> 00:38:59,444
It's gonna age super badly. It's not even good now.

502
00:38:59,444 --> 00:39:02,286
Do we really want to be using memes in our-

503
00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:08,587
No, I mean, I think streamers know that devs appreciate them enough without us having to talk down to them like they're-

504
00:39:08,587 --> 00:39:12,289
Wait, what award is this even for anyways?

505
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:14,009
Oh.

506
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:14,790
Oh.

507
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,130
Ahaha.

508
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:16,390
Uh, well.

509
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:24,494
Big thanks to all our subs who voted with their bits for our Audience Award!

510
00:39:24,494 --> 00:39:26,035
Yay!

511
00:39:32,825 --> 00:39:34,366
And the winner is... ♪♪ ♪♪

512
00:39:34,366 --> 00:39:45,954
♪♪ ♪♪ Thank you so much for this audience award.

513
00:39:45,954 --> 00:39:53,920
Of course, all of us that make video games, we started out as members of the audience, right?

514
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,984
We played video games that moved us emotionally, that really excited our creativity,

515
00:39:59,984 --> 00:40:01,605
and inspired us.

516
00:40:02,002 --> 00:40:05,024
to want to pay it forward, to make games ourselves.

517
00:40:05,024 --> 00:40:07,366
And so getting this award, it means that

518
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:10,509
with Ghost of Tsushima, did a good job.

519
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:12,150
And that feels amazing.

520
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,772
I know from all of us at Sucker Punch,

521
00:40:14,772 --> 00:40:17,654
we want to thank you for giving us your time.

522
00:40:17,654 --> 00:40:21,317
There are a lot of fantastic games out there

523
00:40:21,317 --> 00:40:22,838
and you played Ghost.

524
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,560
Hopefully we've inspired you to go forth

525
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,502
and make the next game that inspires the next person

526
00:40:28,502 --> 00:40:29,783
and so on and so forth.

527
00:40:30,707 --> 00:40:33,799
Because video games are beautiful and we should all pay it forward.

528
00:41:53,396 --> 00:41:57,078
Best Technology.

00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:27,862
This is.

545
00:43:27,862 --> 00:43:29,164
Hi, my name is Jörg Neumann.

546
00:43:29,164 --> 00:43:31,007
I'm the head of Microsoft Flight Simulator.

547
00:43:31,955 --> 00:43:36,256
When we first unveiled the trailer for the new simulator back at E3 2019,

548
00:43:36,256 --> 00:43:41,037
we could have not imagined the positive and wonderful response from the community.

549
00:43:41,037 --> 00:43:45,418
From our global preview event to our tech alpha and betas,

550
00:43:45,418 --> 00:43:49,260
to launch at many world and sim updates, it has been an amazing journey.

551
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,301
It is humbling to see how many fans have embraced the sim,

552
00:43:53,301 --> 00:43:58,102
and this award celebrates the passion the teams at Asobo,

553
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:00,883
Xbox, Bing, and many others have for this franchise.

554
00:44:01,678 --> 00:44:09,642
I would be remiss not to recognize and thank all the many talented developers who have contributed to this franchise over the last 39 years.

555
00:44:09,642 --> 00:44:13,744
And the contributions go beyond the core development team.

556
00:44:13,744 --> 00:44:20,607
So many third-party developers have elevated and expanded not only Microsoft Flight Simulator, but the genre as a whole.

557
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:25,370
With many amazing mods and add-ons that delight fans around the world.

558
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:30,873
On behalf of every developer who's contributed to Microsoft Flight Simulator, thank you.

559
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:47,178
Where do you even start with Tom Fulp?

560
00:44:47,178 --> 00:44:47,198
I...

561
00:44:47,198 --> 00:44:47,898
The guy's a legend.

562
00:44:47,898 --> 00:44:55,240
He's done more single-handedly for the gaming and entertainment industry as a whole than...

563
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,302
And there's not enough time in the day, is what I'm saying, to talk about Tom Fulp.

564
00:44:59,302 --> 00:45:00,262
But we'll try anyway.

565
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:01,082
Um...

566
00:45:01,082 --> 00:45:02,302
Tom Fulp.

567
00:45:02,302 --> 00:45:03,643
Husband to a badass wife.

568
00:45:03,643 --> 00:45:05,403
Father of two awesome kids.

569
00:45:06,815 --> 00:45:11,116
Three, if you consider the black sheep, newgrounds.com.

570
00:45:11,116 --> 00:45:15,537
The lost boy that never quite grew up.

571
00:45:15,537 --> 00:45:18,678
See you don't talk about Tom Foulke without bringing up Newgrounds.

572
00:45:18,678 --> 00:45:23,819
So years before YouTube was a thing, Newgrounds was the website where you would go to find

573
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:27,640
all of the newest cartoons and games from your favorite online creators.

574
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,241
And it was all a completely self-regulated system.

575
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:34,902
All judgments, all content had to go through an approval process that was regulated by

576
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:35,622
the users.

577
00:45:35,622 --> 00:45:36,322
It was amazing.

578
00:45:37,062 --> 00:45:39,645
No one had quite seen something just like that before.

579
00:45:39,645 --> 00:45:42,167
It's where you went for everything.

580
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:43,368
By everyone.

581
00:45:43,368 --> 00:45:44,809
And it still is.

582
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:48,012
Even now, after Adobe's closed its doors on Flash forever,

583
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:50,575
Newgrounds is still somehow thriving.

584
00:45:50,575 --> 00:45:56,580
It's a testament to the man's enduring image of what games and entertainment actually are.

585
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:02,065
And what began as a basement-run website in the mid-90s has now...

586
00:46:02,765 --> 00:46:09,548
over the last decade become the industry foot in the door for hundreds upon hundreds of creators

587
00:46:09,548 --> 00:46:13,850
trying to get into the games and animation industries, or even just entertainment.

588
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:17,432
People like myself, who owe everything to what Newgrounds has done for them.

589
00:46:17,432 --> 00:46:20,854
Tom also co-founded The Behemoth, the game development company,

590
00:46:20,854 --> 00:46:25,776
and you know them if you've played Alien Hominid or Castle Crashers.

591
00:46:26,901 --> 00:46:29,345
That's right. That was him and

592
00:46:29,345 --> 00:46:35,415
He didn't just oversee production. He made those games. Look at the end of the day Tom Fulp may not be the

593
00:46:35,415 --> 00:46:37,979
father of the internet, but

594
00:46:38,888 --> 00:46:49,453
If you've ever shared your creative content online for other people to enjoy, or opened up your browser to see how far you could launch a cartoon animal.

595
00:46:49,453 --> 00:46:51,494
If you've ever quoted to your friends,

596
00:46:51,494 --> 00:46:52,795
We're on a bridge, Charlie!

597
00:46:52,795 --> 00:46:54,535
Or, I like rusty spoons!

598
00:46:54,535 --> 00:46:57,257
Or, all your bass are belong to us.

599
00:46:57,257 --> 00:47:02,459
If you've ever done any of these things, if it applies to you, then Tom Fulp is the father of the internet that you know.

600
00:47:02,459 --> 00:47:05,881
He's also a hot dad, so that's kind of cool.

601
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:08,162
Congratulations, Tom.

602
00:47:10,857 --> 00:47:13,379
Hey everyone, it's really great to be here.

603
00:47:13,379 --> 00:47:15,601
All my life, I dreamed of making games,

604
00:47:15,601 --> 00:47:18,824
but I dreamed about it the way a kid dreams

605
00:47:18,824 --> 00:47:21,727
about being a superhero, where you don't think

606
00:47:21,727 --> 00:47:24,089
it would actually happen in reality.

607
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:27,472
So it's kind of surreal to be here right now,

608
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:31,676
winning this award and having gotten to make games.

609
00:47:31,676 --> 00:47:34,959
So I'd like to thank GDC for choosing me.

610
00:47:34,959 --> 00:47:36,020
It's been a huge honor.

611
00:47:37,894 --> 00:47:43,420
If it wasn't for Flash, I don't know if I would have had the opportunity to live out this dream.

612
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:46,423
And I think a lot of people share the same sort of story.

613
00:47:46,423 --> 00:47:51,087
Flash and the internet was a game changer that allowed people to make games who otherwise

614
00:47:51,087 --> 00:47:55,412
might not have, and that energy is what drove Newgrounds and continues to carry it forward

615
00:47:55,412 --> 00:47:56,593
to this day.

616
00:47:57,466 --> 00:48:02,829
I'd like to thank Ross Snyder for bringing his programming expertise to the Newgrounds portal,

617
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:07,432
allowing people to instantly publish their games in animation, which was a big thing in the year 2000.

618
00:48:07,432 --> 00:48:10,353
It's really exciting times, building out that system.

619
00:48:10,353 --> 00:48:14,475
I'd like to thank all the pioneers who shared their flash on Newgrounds.

620
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:18,598
We were all kind of inspiring each other and making each other up our game all the time.

621
00:48:20,102 --> 00:48:24,806
Along the way, I had the good fortune of teaming up with John Baez and Dan Paladin to form

622
00:48:24,806 --> 00:48:29,409
The Behemoth, where I got to make console games like Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers.

623
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:33,712
And it's been really rewarding to see other people from the Flash scene go along the same

624
00:48:33,712 --> 00:48:39,156
sort of journey with their games like The Binding of Isaac, Among Us, Rogue Legacy,

625
00:48:39,156 --> 00:48:41,218
Super Meat Boy, and now Friday Night Funkin'.

626
00:48:42,202 --> 00:48:47,064
There's been a lot of twists and turns along the way, including the death of Flash.

627
00:48:47,064 --> 00:48:50,846
With that, I'd like to thank Mike Welsh and everyone who works on Ruffle.

628
00:48:50,846 --> 00:48:56,069
Ruffle is an open source Flash player that's bringing more and more Flash games back to the

629
00:48:56,069 --> 00:49:02,693
web. And over time, we risk losing a lot of games to history. So I think we should all thank everyone

630
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:07,836
working in game preservation in general. Increasingly feels like preserving old games is just

631
00:49:07,836 --> 00:49:09,677
as important as making new games.

632
00:49:11,153 --> 00:49:16,216
As for me, I'm still making games and I look forward to sharing Nightmare Cops with everyone when it's done.

633
00:49:16,216 --> 00:49:26,441
And for all of you working year after year on your own dream games, I see you and good luck and we'll all get there eventually.

634
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:30,263
To wrap this up, thank you again for this award and I'll see you on the internet.

635
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:37,281
Our next award is for Best Narrative.

636
00:49:37,281 --> 00:49:40,183
As a game writer myself, this category is...

637
00:49:40,183 --> 00:49:40,483
Oh my gosh.

638
00:49:40,483 --> 00:49:42,605
Oh my gosh, that's our publisher.

639
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:45,467
Oh, I'm so sorry. I have to take this.

640
00:49:45,467 --> 00:49:46,068
Hello?

641
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:48,029
You, the writer. I'm glad you're free.

642
00:49:48,029 --> 00:49:51,772
Um, actually, I was kind of in the middle of something, but...

643
00:49:51,772 --> 00:49:52,933
Have you ever watched Titanic?

644
00:49:52,933 --> 00:49:53,614
Uh, yeah. I mean...

645
00:49:53,614 --> 00:49:57,657
Wonderful. I've just watched it for the first time today.

646
00:49:57,657 --> 00:50:01,940
I feel like you should rewrite everything to be more like the movie Titanic.

647
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:07,108
You want me to rewrite the GDC awards so they're more like... Titanic.

648
00:50:07,108 --> 00:50:09,149
Yes! Exactly. I'm glad we're on the same page.

649
00:50:09,149 --> 00:50:14,470
It's just that I'm actually currently presenting the GDC awards, so it feels like

650
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:19,592
it's a little late to be making that kind of like fundamental change to our-

651
00:50:19,592 --> 00:50:23,314
Right! I know you can do it. I'll check back in an hour.

652
00:50:23,314 --> 00:50:27,375
Right. Well, while I get to work on that, here are our nominees for Best Narrative.

653
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:33,683

Take a look.

685
00:52:20,067 --> 00:52:21,148
I thought I'd do an outfit change.

686
00:52:21,148 --> 00:52:23,088
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what do you think?

687
00:52:23,088 --> 00:52:24,449
With blazer or without blazer?

688
00:52:24,449 --> 00:52:27,390
You think you want to see without blazer?

689
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:28,351
Okay, okay, hang on, hang on.

690
00:52:28,351 --> 00:52:28,771
I'll digit it.

691
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,412
There, what do you think?

692
00:52:30,412 --> 00:52:31,352
Yeah?

693
00:52:31,352 --> 00:52:35,214
Better without, I think without blazer?

694
00:52:35,214 --> 00:52:36,354
Yeah, okay, we'll mix it up.

695
00:52:36,354 --> 00:52:38,875
We'll do without blazer, okay.

696
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:39,255
Here we go.

697
00:52:41,262 --> 00:52:47,684
Games would be nothing without the beautiful soundscapes created by our incredibly talented audio departments.

698
00:52:47,684 --> 00:52:53,927
Plus, their soundproofing needs mean they always get the best and most private offices in the studio.

699
00:52:53,927 --> 00:52:56,747
And for that, the rest of us are immensely jealous.

700
00:52:56,747 --> 00:53:03,350
Here are the nominees for Best Audio.

701
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:03,930
Best Audio

702
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:04,390
Best Audio

703
00:53:11,297 --> 00:53:16,319
Developed by Supergiant Games, Darren Ford.

704
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:17,900
The Last of Us Part II.

Developed by Naughty Dog.

706
00:53:21,321 --> 00:53:27,224
Published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

707
00:53:27,224 --> 00:53:32,106
The Naughty Dog Development Team.

708
00:53:37,617 --> 00:53:44,540
Doom Eternal, developed by Kade Software, published by Bethesda Softworks.

709
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:52,222
Hugo Martin, Marty Stratton, Mick Gordon, Chad Mossholder.

710
00:53:52,222 --> 00:53:58,485
Final Fantasy VII Remake, developed by Square Enix.

711
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,845
Makoto Issei.

712
00:54:07,725 --> 00:54:10,166
Ghost of Tsushima

713
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:14,869
Developed by Sucker Punch Productions

714
00:54:14,869 --> 00:54:25,073
Published by Sony Interactive Entertainment

715
00:54:25,073 --> 00:54:26,634
And the winner is

716
00:54:38,628 --> 00:54:41,449
I want to say thank you so much to the Game Developers Choice Awards.

717
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:46,771
It is really incredible to be honored in a category with these incredible games.

718
00:54:46,771 --> 00:54:52,273
And this is Regis here who helped bring Cerberus to life along with the dogs of several other

719
00:54:52,273 --> 00:54:52,853
team members.

720
00:54:52,853 --> 00:54:57,095
So I want to say thank you to all the team dogs for all the love and support on this

721
00:54:57,095 --> 00:54:57,935
project.

722
00:54:57,935 --> 00:55:03,637
And I want to say thank you to our incredible families for putting up with a lot of this

723
00:55:03,637 --> 00:55:05,778
work being done in our homes towards the end of the project.

724
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:10,742
And I want to say thank you to my incredible team at Supergiant Games

725
00:55:10,742 --> 00:55:16,966
for being some of the most wonderful and talented people that I know.

726
00:55:16,966 --> 00:55:21,670
And it is really a joy to do what I do every day

727
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:26,694
and to be able to call it my job. So thank you so much.

728
00:55:26,694 --> 00:55:31,298
VR and AR games are more realistic than ever, completely disrupting our idea of

729
00:55:31,298 --> 00:55:32,759
what reality even is.

730
00:55:32,759 --> 00:55:35,461
Hi, this is Jason Schreier calling from Bloomberg News.

731
00:55:37,049 --> 00:55:39,310
Uh, hi?

732
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:41,892
Yeah, I'm just calling for comment on a story.

733
00:55:41,892 --> 00:55:43,813
What kind of story?

734
00:55:43,813 --> 00:55:48,675
So I've heard from two sources that this awards show is a bit of a disaster.

735
00:55:48,675 --> 00:55:51,777
Really? I mean, it's gone a little off the rails, but I don't think it's too, like-

736
00:55:51,777 --> 00:55:54,879
Do you want to chat? I'd be happy to keep you anonymous.

737
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,780
I'm in the middle of hosting!

738
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:00,802
Yeah, I just think our readers deserve to know what's really happening here.

739
00:56:00,802 --> 00:56:04,444
You know I can't talk to you! Oh my god, how do I turn this off?

740
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,825
They're calling this the Anthem of Award Shows.

741
00:56:06,825 --> 00:56:06,885
Ugh!

742
00:56:07,461 --> 00:56:09,423
Can someone please call IT?

743
00:56:09,423 --> 00:56:10,423
What even just happened?

744
00:56:10,423 --> 00:56:13,806
Um, anyways, here's our nominees for Best VR AR Game.

745
00:56:13,806 --> 00:56:19,091
Was that even real?

746
00:56:19,091 --> 00:56:23,755
Best VR AR Game

747
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:26,417
The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners

748
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:28,899
Developed by Skydance Interactive

749
00:56:28,899 --> 00:56:30,600
Peter Ackman

750
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,323
Mark Domwitz

751
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:34,784
Todd Adamson

752
00:56:34,784 --> 00:56:35,725
Jesse Young

753
00:56:38,572 --> 00:56:51,759
Paper Beast, developed by Pixel Reef, Eric Chahi.

754
00:56:51,759 --> 00:56:56,061
Dreams, developed by Media Molecule,

755
00:56:56,061 --> 00:57:01,423
published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

756
00:57:09,918 --> 00:57:13,040
You will not save him.

757
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,841
Don't worry, it's unloaded.

758
00:57:15,841 --> 00:57:19,943
It's unloaded now!

759
00:57:19,943 --> 00:57:23,344
All this is my fault.

760
00:57:23,344 --> 00:57:26,025
I never told you.

761
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:30,387
I couldn't. I'm so sorry, baby.

762
00:58:39,408 --> 00:58:42,452
It is my distinct honor to introduce Laura Lynn.

763
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:46,597
I count her as a close friend, an amazing game maker, and a superlative human being.

764
00:58:46,597 --> 00:58:50,502
Laura Lynn has quietly been elevating the work of anyone with the good fortune to be

765
00:58:50,502 --> 00:58:52,605
her teammate over the last three decades.

766
00:58:52,605 --> 00:58:56,310
Her humility, talent, and perseverance are in such abundance that she has enough of

767
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,832
each to share with everyone around her.

768
00:58:58,787 --> 00:59:00,889
After a couple of attempts at starting her own companies,

769
00:59:00,889 --> 00:59:03,513
she eventually joined another studio on the design team,

770
00:59:03,513 --> 00:59:05,776
and soon thereafter became the lead designer

771
00:59:05,776 --> 00:59:06,817
on Full Spectrum Warrior,

772
00:59:06,817 --> 00:59:09,220
where she and her team delivered a top-tier squad game

773
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:12,765
in the vein of XCOM that delivered innovations in gameplay

774
00:59:12,765 --> 00:59:15,088
and user experience that garnered best-of noms

775
00:59:15,088 --> 00:59:17,051
and player adulation on its release.

776
00:59:17,558 --> 00:59:22,160
Not content to rest on her successes, she moved over to Sony Online where she became

777
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,643
creative director of an ambitious MMO, Free Realms, aimed at bringing a whole new audience

778
00:59:26,643 --> 00:59:30,845
and generation of players to the game, as well as a new way of involving those players

779
00:59:30,845 --> 00:59:31,866
in their own storytelling.

780
00:59:32,378 --> 00:59:36,199
It's hard to overstate the accomplishments and success of Free Realms when it released in 2011.

781
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:43,461
It was free to play, play-available the web, player advancement was multifaceted and not solely dependent on combat,

782
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:50,984
avatar customization was expansive, player self-expression and cooperative storytelling were at the center of its goals and its successes.

783
00:59:50,984 --> 00:59:54,244
It was wildly popular, reaching over 10 million players at its peak.

784
00:59:54,244 --> 00:59:59,046
We're still seeing reverberations from this title 10 years on throughout the MMO and free-to-play sectors.

785
00:59:59,046 --> 01:00:01,907
More recently, she really landed as chief creative officer.

786
01:00:02,264 --> 01:00:06,886
Skydance Interactive, where she explored and set the groundwork for innovative storytelling in the

787
01:00:06,886 --> 01:00:11,009
wildly successful VR title, The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners. Without the foundation

788
01:00:11,009 --> 01:00:16,131
Laura Lynn had laid, it would have been easy to let the technological and gameplay accomplishments

789
01:00:16,131 --> 01:00:20,233
of Saints and Sinners overshadow the humanity of the game. Throughout her career, Laura Lynn

790
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:25,196
has challenged herself and her teammates and her craft at every opportunity, looking for ways to

791
01:00:25,196 --> 01:00:28,718
further storytelling and interactivity in that eclectic marriage that is game making.

792
01:00:29,371 --> 01:00:35,014
Modern game making is a collaborative effort, one that benefits from people who know how to bring out the best in everyone on the team,

793
01:00:35,014 --> 01:00:40,918
who always keep players in mind as we engage in our craft, and who never lose sight of the excitement that playing games can bring.

794
01:00:40,918 --> 01:00:47,561
I can't think of somebody who better embodies this and more deserves recognition for modeling what a game maker should be than Laura Lin.

795
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,282
Congratulations, Laura Lin.

796
01:00:51,461 --> 01:00:53,762
I feel like saying thank you isn't nearly enough,

797
01:00:53,762 --> 01:00:55,523
especially considering the people

798
01:00:55,523 --> 01:00:57,765
who have gotten this award before me.

799
01:00:57,765 --> 01:00:59,045
And that thank you isn't just

800
01:00:59,045 --> 01:01:01,127
for the Game Developers Choice Committee,

801
01:01:01,127 --> 01:01:02,848
but for everyone I've ever worked alongside

802
01:01:02,848 --> 01:01:05,369
and everyone who's supported me over the years.

803
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:07,310
I genuinely can't wrap my head around this honor.

804
01:01:08,562 --> 01:01:12,443
But in this moment, I also can't help thinking of my path to get here.

805
01:01:12,443 --> 01:01:16,304
As a young kid, I always thought attractions like Pirates of the Caribbean were magic,

806
01:01:16,304 --> 01:01:18,024
living, immersive stories.

807
01:01:18,024 --> 01:01:21,665
But then around 1980, I got this weird new game called Adventureland from my home computer.

808
01:01:21,665 --> 01:01:25,586
It was a text adventure, a living story that was actually interactive,

809
01:01:25,586 --> 01:01:28,647
where I could make choices and those choices mattered.

810
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:30,207
Now, that was magic.

811
01:01:30,642 --> 01:01:35,084
I immediately started making my own text adventure, a romance game where you were stranded on

812
01:01:35,084 --> 01:01:38,726
an island with a cute guy, because I was 16.

813
01:01:38,726 --> 01:01:44,589
But even then, I knew exactly what I was supposed to be doing with the rest of my life, making

814
01:01:44,589 --> 01:01:44,749
games.

815
01:01:44,749 --> 01:01:45,709
But how?

816
01:01:45,709 --> 01:01:50,212
So I did a bunch of other stuff, but then in 1993, everything changed when I played

817
01:01:50,212 --> 01:01:50,712
Myst.

818
01:01:50,712 --> 01:01:54,834
They'd made a living, breathing, interactive world, and now it looked real.

819
01:01:55,684 --> 01:01:57,344
I couldn't take it anymore.

820
01:01:57,344 --> 01:01:59,905
I taught myself 3D graphics, I improved my scripting,

821
01:01:59,905 --> 01:02:01,665
I made a demo, I sold it to Microprose

822
01:02:01,665 --> 01:02:03,346
and started my own company.

823
01:02:03,346 --> 01:02:06,787
And then two years later, my very first game was canceled.

824
01:02:06,787 --> 01:02:08,607
My second game was canceled too,

825
01:02:08,607 --> 01:02:10,367
so welcome to game development.

826
01:02:10,367 --> 01:02:13,448
It's been almost 30 years since then,

827
01:02:13,448 --> 01:02:15,509
and 41 years since I first played Adventureland.

828
01:02:15,509 --> 01:02:19,590
And I still get up every morning, a couple hours early,

829
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:22,310
even if that means 6 a.m., so I have time to play games.

830
01:02:23,069 --> 01:02:26,830
And even now, after all this time, when I sit down to play Returnal or replay Prey or

831
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:30,392
dive headfirst back into Mass Effect, it's still magic.

832
01:02:30,392 --> 01:02:33,733
So I'll leave you with one thought.

833
01:02:33,733 --> 01:02:35,113
We're all wizards.

834
01:02:35,113 --> 01:02:35,453
All of us.

835
01:02:35,453 --> 01:02:39,775
No matter how experienced we are, no matter what our role is or what kind of games we're

836
01:02:39,775 --> 01:02:44,357
building or who those games are for, we all make magic.

837
01:02:44,357 --> 01:02:47,078
But that magic comes from unexpected places.

838
01:02:47,753 --> 01:02:50,155
I never studied computer science or art in school,

839
01:02:50,155 --> 01:02:51,957
and the concept of game designer as a role

840
01:02:51,957 --> 01:02:54,480
didn't even exist back then.

841
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,302
I was almost 30 when I started my career in games.

842
01:02:56,302 --> 01:02:58,725
In most companies at that time,

843
01:02:58,725 --> 01:03:01,608
I was one of one or two or maybe three women

844
01:03:01,608 --> 01:03:03,109
in the whole company,

845
01:03:03,109 --> 01:03:05,992
and almost always the only woman in a leadership role.

846
01:03:05,992 --> 01:03:09,136
So I know what it's like to be conspicuously different,

847
01:03:09,136 --> 01:03:10,337
and yet, here I am.

848
01:03:11,445 --> 01:03:15,687
We all have our own paths, our own ways to create magic for our players.

849
01:03:15,687 --> 01:03:19,588
And each one of those unique paths brings something special and new

850
01:03:19,588 --> 01:03:21,628
to the game and the team and the company.

851
01:03:21,628 --> 01:03:25,410
So my wish for all of us individuals and the industry as a whole

852
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:30,651
is that we'll keep taking risks and we'll grow and we'll welcome fellow wizards

853
01:03:30,651 --> 01:03:32,352
of all types and all paths.

854
01:03:32,352 --> 01:03:36,473
There's something to learn from each of us and in each of us, there's magic.

855
01:03:36,473 --> 01:03:39,314
So thank you again from the bottom of my heart.

856
01:03:44,632 --> 01:03:50,255
And now for everyone's favorite part of the awards ceremony.

857
01:03:50,255 --> 01:03:52,136
I'm sorry, does that say commercials?

858
01:03:52,136 --> 01:03:55,658
No, I mean, I'm just confused.

859
01:03:55,658 --> 01:03:58,640
Like video games are the biggest selling industry in the world.

860
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:02,002
I mean, we bring in like three times what box office does in a year,

861
01:04:02,002 --> 01:04:03,662
over seven times what music does.

862
01:04:03,662 --> 01:04:07,745
Why would we need to sell ad space during our awards ceremony?

863
01:04:07,745 --> 01:04:13,047
Where's all the money going?

864
01:04:13,047 --> 01:04:13,648
Right.

865
01:04:15,288 --> 01:04:20,791
Right. Okay, well, we're cutting that, and instead, this airspace is just gonna be me,

866
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:23,333
smiling to camera, and saying,

867
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:25,194
UNIONIZE!

868
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:28,636
And now, the award for the industry's biggest money maker,

869
01:04:28,636 --> 01:04:33,139
accounting for nearly half of all money brought in by video games, period,

870
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:39,103
Best Mobile Game.

871
01:04:39,103 --> 01:04:43,245

Hello everyone, here is Hao Yutai.

889
01:06:17,172 --> 01:06:20,033
As the CEO and producer of MiHoYo,

890
01:06:20,033 --> 01:06:24,636
it's absolutely thrilling to accept the best mobile game

891
01:06:24,636 --> 01:06:27,517
of GDC Awards for Genshin Impact.

892
01:06:27,517 --> 01:06:32,380
It was a crazy idea to bring the open world

893
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:36,322
adventure experience to the mobile platform back in 2017.

894
01:06:36,322 --> 01:06:39,724
We made the launch of Genshin Impact

895
01:06:39,724 --> 01:06:41,065
in September last year.

896
01:06:41,587 --> 01:06:47,688
and was surprised to see Genshin Impact has been well received by our fans globally.

897
01:06:47,688 --> 01:06:52,750
So here today, I'd like to share this award with every team member

898
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:56,291
who has been working hard enough on this project.

899
01:06:56,291 --> 01:07:01,332
And most importantly, a big thank you to our fans globally

900
01:07:01,332 --> 01:07:04,233
who've been living in and supporting us.

901
01:07:04,233 --> 01:07:06,594
Without you, we cannot be here. Thank you.

902
01:07:10,575 --> 01:07:13,157
We have another award on deck here, but I just got a ping on Slack.

903
01:07:13,157 --> 01:07:15,458
So hang on a second. Let me just bring this up here.

904
01:07:15,458 --> 01:07:18,700
Okay, it's from Chad, our chief visionary creative.

905
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,562
Okay, let's see what he has to say.

906
01:07:20,562 --> 01:07:20,982
Hi, Sam.

907
01:07:20,982 --> 01:07:22,443
Been doing some thinking.

908
01:07:22,443 --> 01:07:26,706
Okay, I've been in the industry about 20 years now,

909
01:07:26,706 --> 01:07:29,148
and I've just had my first daughter.

910
01:07:29,148 --> 01:07:33,110
Starting to think that maybe women are people.

911
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:35,012
Haven't gotten too far into it yet,

912
01:07:35,012 --> 01:07:38,774
but we should pivot to make the awards about a middle-aged man

913
01:07:38,774 --> 01:07:39,915
becoming a father.

914
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:42,925
and dealing with his own daddy issues.

915
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:45,406
You are probably not the best fit for this, so...

916
01:07:45,406 --> 01:07:45,646
Uh-huh.

917
01:07:45,646 --> 01:07:47,386
You know what?

918
01:07:47,386 --> 01:07:51,108
I'm just going to set my status to away

919
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:52,748
and pretend that I never saw that.

920
01:07:52,748 --> 01:07:53,608
Okay.

921
01:07:53,608 --> 01:07:57,750
So, since creative leadership is clearly having a moment,

922
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:59,570
why don't we go ahead and take a look at the games

923
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:02,731
that were objectively beautiful last year that we all loved?

924
01:08:02,731 --> 01:08:04,832
Oh my god, I'm gonna get fired.

925
01:08:10,943 --> 01:08:16,365
best visual art.

01:08:35,294 --> 01:08:36,054

927
01:08:36,054 --> 01:08:36,475
No, this...

928
01:08:36,475 --> 01:08:37,636

940
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:53,271
Hey everyone, it is an absolute honor to win this award for the best visual art.

941
01:09:53,271 --> 01:09:59,513
You know, it takes an entire team of, you know, super creative people at a studio, years

942
01:09:59,513 --> 01:10:06,295
of dedication and hard work, you know, a specific style and, you know, way that you'd like to

943
01:10:06,295 --> 01:10:10,836
depict a place like Feudal Japan, and honestly a lot of collaborating with

944
01:10:11,627 --> 01:10:14,667
you know, team members that maybe we've never worked with before.

945
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:17,748
So I want to thank all of our consultants and our teammates in Japan

946
01:10:17,748 --> 01:10:20,749
that helped us make this game and give us feedback all over the, you know,

947
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:23,289
the course of making this game over the last few years.

948
01:10:23,289 --> 01:10:27,450
And I just want to say thank you to our team, the character artists

949
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:31,151
and environment artists and the concept team and the animators

950
01:10:31,151 --> 01:10:35,532
and, you know, the visual development team, the lighting team,

951
01:10:35,532 --> 01:10:37,813
as well as the graphics engineers.

952
01:10:37,813 --> 01:10:41,233
Thank you so much for everything you've done to make this game great.

953
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:52,134
Thank you for this award. We're honored.

954
01:11:08,728 --> 01:11:10,669
Uh, no, I don't think so. Why?

955
01:11:10,669 --> 01:11:14,790
The guy who made that sitcom cracked the code on narrative.

956
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:17,150
He solved it. He made a chart.

957
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:19,751
We'll use this to plot out every intro for the ceremony.

958
01:11:19,751 --> 01:11:20,131
Every intro?

959
01:11:20,131 --> 01:11:24,031
I mean, I'm sure the chart is great.

960
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:28,932
It's probably just one of many tools in a writer's toolbox.

961
01:11:28,932 --> 01:11:32,213
Like, you know, if someone had really cracked the code on storytelling,

962
01:11:32,213 --> 01:11:33,593
we would all be doing it, so.

963
01:11:33,593 --> 01:11:36,334
Every other department I can measure their progress on a grid.

964
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:36,854
Ugh.

965
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:43,396
Contractors. At least I don't have to pay you royalties, benefits, healthcare, really anything.

966
01:11:43,396 --> 01:11:57,550

980
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:34,975
Thank you for this Game Developers Choice Award for Design.

981
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:38,196
First, we want to thank the video game Rogue,

982
01:13:38,196 --> 01:13:40,037
and all the Rogue-likes that came after it,

983
01:13:40,037 --> 01:13:42,038
which inspired us to see if we had something

984
01:13:42,038 --> 01:13:43,818
we could contribute here.

985
01:13:43,818 --> 01:13:44,999
We also want to thank our team,

986
01:13:44,999 --> 01:13:46,580
who elevates everything we do,

987
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,440
our players in early access,

988
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,641
who gave us invaluable feedback,

989
01:13:50,641 --> 01:13:52,282
and finally, our test maps.

990
01:13:52,282 --> 01:13:54,523
We spent a lot of time in our test maps

991
01:13:54,523 --> 01:13:56,484
trying to figure out what Hades would be,

992
01:13:56,484 --> 01:13:57,404
and when you're doing that,

993
01:13:57,404 --> 01:13:59,265
you have no idea that it's going to lead

994
01:13:59,265 --> 01:14:00,265
to something like this.

995
01:14:00,788 --> 01:14:07,573
So on behalf of Gavin, Greg, Eduardo, Alice, and myself, thank you so much.

996
01:14:07,573 --> 01:14:18,502
Let's take a pause now and remember those co-workers, colleagues, and friends whom we

997
01:14:18,502 --> 01:14:25,027
lost over this last year and remember the ways in which they added to our industry and to our lives.

998
01:14:33,363 --> 01:14:37,004
You

999
01:15:02,378 --> 01:15:05,879
You

1000
01:15:32,265 --> 01:15:49,024
Thank you for watching and for everything you do for us each day, we love you!

1002
01:17:17,269 --> 01:17:22,933
I don't want to introduce the Innovation Award. No, I don't want to. Okay, fine, if it's so easy,

1003
01:17:22,933 --> 01:17:27,356
then why don't you tell Naughty Dog they're not nominated for a whole category? Yeah,

1004
01:17:27,356 --> 01:17:32,080
yeah, that's what I thought. Mm-hmm, that's what I thought. Fine, fine, you know what,

1005
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:36,543
fine. Here, nominees for the Innovation Award. So I'm gonna go hide under my desk before the

1006
01:17:36,543 --> 01:17:37,924
Sony snipers find me. Bye.

1007
01:17:44,208 --> 01:17:46,930

I'd like to thank our friends and family at Sony for supporting us along this journey.

1020
01:19:29,736 --> 01:19:36,240
And, as always, it's the community that I have the most thanks to.

1021
01:19:36,834 --> 01:19:44,939
In many ways the success of our innovation in making dreams has been to empower the innovation of our community

1022
01:19:44,939 --> 01:19:48,422
and it brings us joy every day to see the things that they're making.

1023
01:19:54,040 --> 01:20:00,022
Now, any Game Awards ceremony wouldn't be complete without a deeply awkward celebrity cameo.

1024
01:20:00,022 --> 01:20:04,985
And for this year's GDC Awards, have we got a surprise for you.

1025
01:20:04,985 --> 01:20:09,547
So please, help me in welcoming...

1026
01:20:09,547 --> 01:20:11,988
What do you mean we don't have Mercer?

1027
01:20:11,988 --> 01:20:13,248
Well, what are we supposed to do?

1028
01:20:13,248 --> 01:20:15,489
He's the only voice actor anyone recognizes.

1029
01:20:15,489 --> 01:20:17,710
I don't know what we're supposed to...

1030
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:18,250
Okay, fine, fine.

1031
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:18,711
You know what? Fine.

1032
01:20:18,711 --> 01:20:22,272
Everyone, please help me welcome my producer, Leslie, to the stage.

1033
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:22,472
What?

1034
01:20:24,169 --> 01:20:25,592
Why am I on camera?

1035
01:20:25,592 --> 01:20:28,997
You are now our celebrity guest!

1036
01:20:28,997 --> 01:20:30,099
Say hi to the crowd!

1037
01:20:30,099 --> 01:20:33,205
Hi. Listen, we're way off the timeline here,

1038
01:20:33,205 --> 01:20:34,507
and unless we do some serious triage,

1039
01:20:34,507 --> 01:20:36,731
we're not going to be able to end the show in time.

1040
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:38,113
Did you make a Jira for that?

1041
01:20:40,851 --> 01:20:43,712
Producers do more than make Jiras.

1042
01:20:43,712 --> 01:20:45,692
Nothing would ship without producers.

1043
01:20:45,692 --> 01:20:47,452
I'm sorry?

1044
01:20:47,452 --> 01:20:50,273
Are you saying that without producers,

1045
01:20:50,273 --> 01:20:53,533
game writers would just throw down a bunch of random shit

1046
01:20:53,533 --> 01:20:56,174
that is completely unmakeable in-engine

1047
01:20:56,174 --> 01:20:59,095
and just assume that's gonna end up on screen

1048
01:20:59,095 --> 01:21:01,695
because we have a god complex?

1049
01:21:01,695 --> 01:21:02,895
Yes.

1050
01:21:02,895 --> 01:21:04,156
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1051
01:21:04,156 --> 01:21:05,976
Whatever, I have no idea what you're talking about.

1052
01:21:06,427 --> 01:21:14,854
Anyways, here's 14 unicorns swimming through an ocean of golden flower petals to announce our Game of the Year.

1053
01:21:14,854 --> 01:21:22,181
We can't afford that.

1054
01:21:22,181 --> 01:21:22,281
What?!

1055
01:21:22,281 --> 01:21:25,143
Game of the Year.

1056
01:21:25,143 --> 01:21:32,470

1061
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,420

01:22:17,264 --> 01:22:25,606
I really hope you make it.

Ghost of Tsushima.

1070
01:23:27,721 --> 01:23:29,722
The Mongols took it.

Published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

1074
01:23:40,347 --> 01:23:41,487
She can out-shoot any samurai I know.

1075
01:23:41,487 --> 01:23:41,907
I'm coming with you.

1076
01:23:41,907 --> 01:23:44,688
Now, send them to their ancestors.

1077
01:23:44,688 --> 01:23:46,969
Do you deserve death?

1078
01:23:46,969 --> 01:23:48,650
I hope not, my lord.

1079
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:49,631
Then you're safe.

1080
01:23:49,631 --> 01:23:51,511
I can't let more of our people die.

1081
01:24:11,303 --> 01:24:14,145
Thank you very much for the Game Developers Choice Award

1082
01:24:14,145 --> 01:24:15,586
for Game of the Year.

1083
01:24:15,586 --> 01:24:19,187
I am here with most of the core team that worked on Hades.

1084
01:24:19,187 --> 01:24:22,429
In 2012, we were really lucky to earn best debut

1085
01:24:22,429 --> 01:24:23,930
with our first game Bastion

1086
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:25,771
at the Game Developers Choice Awards.

1087
01:24:25,771 --> 01:24:27,191
And all of us who worked on that game

1088
01:24:27,191 --> 01:24:28,612
are still working here together today.

1089
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:37,988
on all our projects and I don't think we ever thought we'd be back here again, much less in the company of last year's most beloved video games.

1090
01:24:37,988 --> 01:24:44,576
On behalf of our whole team and all the vital and new voices we've added who helped make Hades what it was,

1091
01:24:44,576 --> 01:24:49,182
we are just really grateful that people liked Hades so much.

1092
01:24:49,322 --> 01:24:52,363
It was a privilege to work on it and to make it at all.

1093
01:24:52,363 --> 01:24:57,284
We want to thank our audience for all our previous games, who encouraged us, and also

1094
01:24:57,284 --> 01:25:02,926
to the fans of Hades in our early access, who gave us feedback that was really, really

1095
01:25:02,926 --> 01:25:04,767
critical to helping finish Hades out.

1096
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:10,269
Thank you to our partners and the platforms who helped Hades find an audience, and to

1097
01:25:10,269 --> 01:25:12,910
our families who love and support us.

1098
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:17,531
It feels really, really, really, really good to make them proud with a huge honor like

1099
01:25:17,531 --> 01:25:18,251
this one.

1100
01:25:18,251 --> 01:25:18,612
Thank you.

1101
01:25:19,293 --> 01:25:19,913
Thank you.

1102
01:25:19,913 --> 01:25:20,173
Thank you.

1103
01:25:20,173 --> 01:25:20,713
Thank you guys.

1104
01:25:20,713 --> 01:25:21,033
Thank you.

1105
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:21,973
Thank you.

1106
01:25:21,973 --> 01:25:22,393
Thank you.

1107
01:25:22,393 --> 01:25:28,454
Thanks for joining us everybody.

1108
01:25:28,454 --> 01:25:32,555
And a huge thanks to Katie, Blair, Leslie,

1109
01:25:32,555 --> 01:25:35,496
Jason, Sandesh, the jury, the crew,

1110
01:25:35,496 --> 01:25:38,356
and everyone who worked so hard on these awards.

1111
01:25:38,356 --> 01:25:39,936
So if you haven't clicked that X yet,

1112
01:25:39,936 --> 01:25:43,057
please hire me to write your game

1113
01:25:43,057 --> 01:25:45,497
because I am afraid that I'm going to be blacklisted

1114
01:25:45,497 --> 01:25:46,498
in the industry after this.

1115
01:25:46,498 --> 01:25:47,618
So, someone.

1116
01:25:49,070 --> 01:26:06,002
Please.

1117
01:26:06,002 --> 01:26:08,383
Okay, bye! ♪
