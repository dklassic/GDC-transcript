00:00:28,952 --> 00:00:33,535
Hello and welcome to the 23rd Annual Independent Games Festival Awards,

2
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:37,118
and also the second official digital version of the awards ceremony.

3
00:00:37,118 --> 00:00:41,020
I'm your chairman, Kelly Wallach, and yeah, it's been a year.

4
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,464
It's definitely been a year, and you know, we miss you all so much,

5
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:49,426
but it's been really lovely to stay connected through all of the games,

6
00:00:49,426 --> 00:00:52,128
and all the work, and the contribution that folks put into

7
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:53,709
keeping the IGF alive this year.

8
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:56,911
So I really wanted to give a special thanks to all the judges,

9
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:58,592
and jury member, and the staff.

10
00:00:59,114 --> 00:01:03,495
who helped make this possible and also of course to everybody who sent us in their games.

11
00:01:03,495 --> 00:01:06,676
It was a really, really great bunch of games this year.

12
00:01:06,676 --> 00:01:12,397
So it was really heartwarming and lovely to see everyone's work that got submitted.

13
00:01:12,397 --> 00:01:14,178
I also wanted to give a special thanks to ID at Xbox,

14
00:01:14,178 --> 00:01:19,439
who is our supporter for the IGF this year for making this all possible.

15
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,300
Yeah, and a big congratulations to all the finalists and nominees,

16
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,720
the honorable mentions and...

17
00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:26,209
Best of luck.

18
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:28,050
Really looking forward to seeing the winners

19
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,511
and to celebrating with you all.

20
00:01:29,511 --> 00:01:32,492
And hopefully we'll be able to see each other again

21
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,473
in person soon.

22
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:38,255
But until then, miss you, good luck, and enjoy the ceremony.

23
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:38,875
All right, bye.

24
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:47,861
Hi everyone, I'm Victoria Tran, Community Director at InnerSloth,

25
00:01:47,861 --> 00:01:51,203
creators of Among Us and the Henry Stickmin Collection.

26
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:54,506
I am super honored to be your 2021 host for the IGF Awards this year,

27
00:01:54,506 --> 00:02:00,491
which, like most of life for the past while, has been all online.

28
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:06,935
So how do you start a speech about a year like this?

29
00:02:06,935 --> 00:02:08,977
Am I right? Am I right, everyone?

30
00:02:08,977 --> 00:02:11,699
This past year...

31
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:19,420
sucked in so many ways and I'm honestly a little bit afraid to celebrate and a little bit

32
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:25,994
afraid to do this because I don't know what to say to make it better and it feels almost

33
00:02:25,994 --> 00:02:31,799
disrespectful to be celebrating like this at a time when so many people have been through a lot,

34
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:37,063
are currently going through a lot, and have been ignored for so long. An award show won't mitigate

35
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:41,567
any of the pain that people have gone through and that we're still going through but I think there

36
00:02:41,567 --> 00:02:42,408
is a certain...

37
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:46,748
type of power in being here, watching the awards show together.

38
00:02:46,748 --> 00:02:51,971
I genuinely hope that you can celebrate watching these awards with us and also just celebrate

39
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:56,514
where you are right now in moving forward and taking action as I've seen so much of

40
00:02:56,514 --> 00:03:01,797
the industry do, whether it was for Free Palestine, Black Lives Matter, or any of the other causes

41
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:02,918
that we've gathered for.

42
00:03:02,918 --> 00:03:09,282
Especially as someone who works directly with players.

43
00:03:09,282 --> 00:03:10,543
Oh, I'm gonna cry.

44
00:03:10,543 --> 00:03:12,564
I have seen first hand.

45
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:24,591
Oh my god, how much you've changed their lives and how much you've saved them and how much you've saved me

46
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:24,752
um

47
00:03:24,752 --> 00:03:25,932
Ah, oh, sorry, okay

48
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:31,856
Staying hydrated is really important everyone

49
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:38,500
This is a celebration of indie games or as the epic and apple lawsuit called it

50
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:45,404
Items that are so offensive, we cannot speak about them here.

51
00:03:45,404 --> 00:03:50,748
Well, it's too bad that all games are cancelled now. I don't understand tech sometimes.

52
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:55,631
But look, I could go on and on, but this is a celebration of indie games and the nominees,

53
00:03:55,631 --> 00:04:01,095
and I cannot wait for you to see all the wonderful games and to see who takes home an award.

54
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:02,717
So let's just get the show on the road.

55
00:04:02,717 --> 00:04:08,741
To kick us off, we have the nominees for best

56
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:14,909
For Best Student Game, Student Gamers just remind us that, yep, they will always be more

57
00:04:14,909 --> 00:04:20,751
talented than us, there are so many new ideas coming into the indie game space, and honestly,

58
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:22,871
I'm really grateful for that.

59
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:29,813
Make sure you pay attention to the nominees in this category, because this will be on

60
00:04:29,813 --> 00:04:30,553
the final exam.

61
00:04:30,553 --> 00:04:36,015

And we are so excited that you have selected us to win

82
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,652
this award for best student game.

83
00:06:35,652 --> 00:06:40,916
We'd like to extend thanks from our team who couldn't make it

84
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:42,718
today, Caleb, Travis, Nick, Kim, and Erica.

85
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:45,840
This was a labor of love.

86
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,922
It was the brainchild of one John's backstop.

87
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:50,284
And we all worked really hard to make that vision come true.

88
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:50,664
Hi, Mom.

89
00:06:50,664 --> 00:06:55,208
Thank you so much for choosing us to be the best student game.

90
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:57,570
We wanted to make an intriguing game, something

91
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,153
that captures a little bit of the human experience

92
00:07:00,153 --> 00:07:01,474
and morbid curiosity.

93
00:07:01,474 --> 00:07:03,255
We greatly appreciate your support.

94
00:07:03,255 --> 00:07:06,938
We could not be more proud of our team

95
00:07:06,938 --> 00:07:09,341
and excited that you would honor us with this.

96
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,391
I know I'm not the only one that has appreciated a good soundtrack, especially while I'm working

97
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:20,092
and a boss battle song comes on and I'm like really productive.

98
00:07:20,092 --> 00:07:26,394
All I'm saying is that audio can make or break a game, whether that's sound effects or the

99
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:28,614
OST or literally anything else.

100
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,035
So keep those ear balls...

101
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,055
Ear balls.

102
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:37,637

There it is.

119
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:34,144
Genesis Noir wouldn't work without the audio,

120
00:09:34,144 --> 00:09:38,647
and we happen to think it's the best part of the game.

121
00:09:38,647 --> 00:09:40,428
We're so happy that you agree,

122
00:09:40,428 --> 00:09:41,689
and thank you so much for this honor.

123
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:46,721
Yeah, Tom, Vincent, and Joe from Skillbard did all the music and sound design for the game,

124
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:51,685
and they worked tremendously hard to make everything sound really great, rich, and reactive.

125
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:54,687
Thanks for working with us, and you really helped take the game to the next level.

126

We really also want to thank the musicians and vocalists who contributed to the soundtrack.

And the winner is... ... ... ...

147
00:12:18,526 --> 00:12:34,875
... ... ... Um, kia ora everyone. Uh, thank you for the win on the narrative award.

148
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:39,258
Uh, you know, I'm pretty blown away with that.

149
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,120
I think, you know, the game started with no story and then it, you know,

150
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,502
developed one along the way with sort of the environmental storytelling and that.

151
00:12:47,847 --> 00:12:53,390
I think one thing I guess I would like to share around that is basically a little bit of a...

152
00:12:53,973 --> 00:13:00,496
a thing why I did that in the game and it's just I guess this this little frustration I have where

153
00:13:00,496 --> 00:13:06,439
a lot of times indies will make these really great ideas for stories and then or ideas for games where

154
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:12,022
the gameplay is just awesome and then it almost feels like you need to sort of tack on a story

155
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:17,524
that ends up being text-based which adds a lot of work and a lot of extra dev time and I think

156
00:13:17,524 --> 00:13:20,986
you know the reality with this game is you know

157
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:25,133
It won this award without any text at all.

158
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:28,998
And I think it's a kind of thing where I think, you know,

159
00:13:28,998 --> 00:13:31,442
we can all sort of start to think about

160
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:32,744
what stories mean in games

161
00:13:32,744 --> 00:13:35,908
and maybe try to explore different ways of telling them.

162
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:45,085
I want to thank Playism for taking the risk with us, being a new developer and all, but also

163
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:51,169
you know it was one of those moments where I could say things to them and they understood it

164
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:54,852
and I think that's just that shared cultural context around a lot of this stuff, but

165
00:13:54,852 --> 00:14:00,235
you know they took a risk with the sort of more indirect storytelling I wanted to do,

166
00:14:00,235 --> 00:14:03,698
not sort of spelling things out or

167
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,742
foreshadowing things too early and you know I'm sure everyone who's played it

168
00:14:08,742 --> 00:14:13,646
enjoys the story for that and I just want to say thank you to them for that

169
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:18,969
and I think it's one of those things where we've got more stories to tell in

170
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:26,874
the future so me and Thor and you know I think it's this kind of thing where you

171
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:29,676
know if stories are coming out of Lismore

172
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,091
You know, I think anything can be told, can't it?

173
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:34,351
Thank you.

174
00:14:34,351 --> 00:14:39,694
So this next award is a little bit

175
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:42,515
like a popularity contest to whoever wins.

176
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:45,056
Congratulations, you're pretty popular.

177
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:46,917
There's a lot to be said for a game

178
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:49,018
that is able to create a really strong community

179
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:51,059
that cheers on its developers

180
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,679
and encourages others to do the same.

181
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:55,501
I'm a little bit biased because I work in community,

182
00:14:55,501 --> 00:14:58,302
so I think it's really great that these things can happen.

183
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:12,691
And the winner is... ... ... ...

184
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:14,593
... ... Hello everyone,

185
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:16,695
I am Mateo Alaisa, I am the director

186
00:15:16,695 --> 00:15:19,598
of Aarog, and I'm very honoured

187
00:15:19,598 --> 00:15:20,919
to receive this award

188
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,741
on behalf of the whole

189
00:15:22,741 --> 00:15:24,203
team of Hermanos Magia and

190
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:25,043
Leap Game Studios.

191
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:33,207
I must thank especially my team, the help I received from Luis Wong and Sol Sanchez,

192
00:15:33,207 --> 00:15:37,411
as well as Gabriela Laisa and Vania Castagnino.

193
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:42,915
This is a very significant prize to all of us and for the industry in Peru.

194
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:49,039
We hope that we can still deliver these messages to you and to the world and keep talking about

195
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,341
deep meanings in games.

196
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:52,222
Thank you very much.

197
00:15:58,838 --> 00:15:59,519
Are you hydrating?

198
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,799
I wasn't joking.

199
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:06,841
Good design can make you see ordinary things

200
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,001
in new, fantastic ways,

201
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:12,142
like envisioning a conversation as a card battle

202
00:16:12,142 --> 00:16:16,244
or creating a genre called Sawcore.

203
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:17,364
Anything is up for grabs,

204
00:16:17,364 --> 00:16:20,025
and we're all just players in their game.

205
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:22,145
These are your nominees for Best Game Design.

206
00:16:27,475 --> 00:16:32,857

Teri Velme,

210
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:56,827
and dos1.

211
00:16:56,827 --> 00:16:58,228

Doos Diziem

214
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:20,342
There is no game, wrong dimension.

215
00:17:20,342 --> 00:17:24,243
Developed by Rami Apaisal.

216
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:25,263

222
00:17:45,843 --> 00:17:51,065
A Monster's Expedition Through Puzzling Exhibitions, developed by Draknik and friends

223
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:56,668
Alan Hazelden, Benjamin Davis, Jamie Perconti

224
00:17:56,668 --> 00:18:06,813
And the winner is...

225
00:18:16,468 --> 00:18:21,189
I'm especially happy that we got the excellence in design, because Teardown started as a technology

226
00:18:21,189 --> 00:18:23,689
experiment with no particular game in mind at all.

227
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:30,971
And it took almost a full year of prototyping to come up with the right idea, find the right

228
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:33,272
setting and getting the design in place.

229
00:18:33,272 --> 00:18:38,253
It was a very long and bumpy road, and we almost gave up along the way, so thank you

230
00:18:38,253 --> 00:18:44,014
everyone who saw the potential in this when it was just a bunch of videos on Twitter.

231
00:18:44,014 --> 00:18:46,315
Without your support, Teardown wouldn't exist.

232
00:18:47,403 --> 00:18:50,865
Also, huge congratulations to everyone on the team.

233
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:53,426
We're a very small group of developers,

234
00:18:53,426 --> 00:18:55,867
so everyone's contribution is really important.

235
00:18:55,867 --> 00:18:58,589
Also, special thanks to all the fans,

236
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:00,790
the modding community,

237
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,471
and everyone else who made this possible.

238
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:04,232
Thank you.

239
00:19:04,232 --> 00:19:09,955
Whether it's pixel, 2D, 3D, voxel,

240
00:19:09,955 --> 00:19:14,657
art is everything we imagined we would share with the world.

241
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:22,815
Great art can really pack a punch, whether it's in the first 15 seconds of a trailer

242
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:27,436
or within the hours and hours of gameplay.

243
00:19:27,436 --> 00:19:28,056
Oh gosh, um...

244
00:19:28,056 --> 00:19:32,997
These are your nominees for Best Visual Art.

245
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:41,359

And the winner is.

257
00:21:30,261 --> 00:21:33,742
Creating the visual art of Genesis Noir was a huge technical and creative challenge,

258
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:36,682
and we're so happy that the work is resonating with so many people.

259
00:21:36,682 --> 00:21:37,822
Thanks so much for this honor.

260
00:21:37,822 --> 00:21:42,223
We must thank Marcin, Pedro, Mercy, Dave, Audrey, and Mayo.

261
00:21:42,223 --> 00:21:46,444
You guys elevated the simple black and white art of Genesis Noir

262
00:21:46,444 --> 00:21:51,025
and filled in the Big Bang with detail and richness that I couldn't have done on my own.

263
00:21:51,025 --> 00:21:53,705
Also huge thanks to Adria, Jeffrey, Stephen, and Sam

264
00:21:53,705 --> 00:21:57,186
for your huge technical contributions that enabled us to pull this off.

265
00:21:57,186 --> 00:21:58,606
We couldn't have done it without you guys.

266
00:21:58,606 --> 00:21:58,986
Thank you.

267
00:22:03,018 --> 00:22:08,441
Reject what you think games can be and embrace the absolute chaos of the human imagination.

268
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:12,844
These are your nominees for the Nuovo Award.

269
00:22:12,844 --> 00:22:25,411

Thank you to the IGF.

293
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:51,492
The new oval award is synonymous with so many games

294
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:53,253
that have inspired us over the years.

295
00:24:53,253 --> 00:24:55,634
This honor is something that we would have never dared

296
00:24:55,634 --> 00:24:57,035
imagine possible.

297
00:24:57,035 --> 00:24:59,536
We want to congratulate our fellow nominees.

298
00:24:59,536 --> 00:25:01,697
It's an honor to be named alongside each of you.

299
00:25:01,697 --> 00:25:04,239
These are all incredible and super innovative projects.

300
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:06,960
So please everyone who's watching play all of them.

301
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,882
The three of us are only a few members

302
00:25:09,882 --> 00:25:11,122
of a much larger band.

303
00:25:11,122 --> 00:25:14,604
So we accept this on behalf of everyone at the game band

304
00:25:15,569 --> 00:25:18,730
and thank our teammates for all the love,

305
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:21,091
dedication and talent that they put into Blaseball

306
00:25:21,091 --> 00:25:22,612
over the last year.

307
00:25:22,612 --> 00:25:27,774
Joel, Gabe, Roldan, Elena, Corey, Bria, Cedric, Stephanie,

308
00:25:27,774 --> 00:25:31,176

and especially our sluggers and our keepers

311
00:25:35,517 --> 00:25:38,018
who have given so much of themselves,

312
00:25:38,018 --> 00:25:40,519
who work hard every single day to care for it

313
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,820
and shape this growing community.

314
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,321
Making Blaseball with this team.

315
00:25:44,746 --> 00:25:47,587
has been a rare, immense joy amid what was otherwise

316
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,668
a really difficult year.

317
00:25:49,668 --> 00:25:52,589
We also need to thank our families and our loved ones.

318
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:54,309
This game was a Hail Mary.

319
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:57,330
It was by no means a sure thing,

320
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,511
and your constant support and encouragement

321
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:00,231
really kept us going.

322
00:26:00,231 --> 00:26:02,592
And we want to thank the fans as well.

323
00:26:02,592 --> 00:26:04,233
You know, we share this award

324
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:06,194
with the entire play small community,

325
00:26:06,194 --> 00:26:07,894
from Play Small Cares,

326
00:26:07,894 --> 00:26:10,875
all the work that you've done to raise real material support

327
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:13,036
for worthy causes under the Play Small banner.

328
00:26:13,349 --> 00:26:16,150
to all the data crimes and the independent projects

329
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,911
from Cibber, who have helped buoy our technically

330
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:22,213
limited game, to all of the independent artists

331
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:25,334
and fellow fans who bring their joy, care, and creativity

332
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,174
to Placeball.

333
00:26:26,174 --> 00:26:30,316
Placeball is an ongoing dialogue with the community.

334
00:26:30,316 --> 00:26:33,157
We're so grateful to have the opportunity

335
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:35,658
to commune with you through this absurd little game.

336
00:26:35,658 --> 00:26:37,219
You continue to surprise us.

337
00:26:37,219 --> 00:26:38,480
You continue to delight us.

338
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,701
And we're so excited to venture into new eras together.

339
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:42,341
Thank you so much.

340
00:26:42,341 --> 00:26:42,681
Thank you.

341
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:42,922
Thank you.

342
00:26:47,392 --> 00:26:53,175
Hi everyone, I'm extremely honored to present the Seamus McNally Grand Prize nominees for this year.

343
00:26:53,175 --> 00:26:58,398
Last year, I never expected to receive this award, and it meant so much to me to even be nominated for it.

344
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:03,180
Indie games have been a huge source of inspiration for me, ever since I discovered that they were a thing.

345
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:09,343
I remember thinking that it was incredible that one or two or a handful of people could put together a game

346
00:27:09,343 --> 00:27:13,645
and release it on their own without a huge studio or a ton of resources,

347
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:15,366
and thinking that maybe I could do that someday.

348
00:27:15,787 --> 00:27:20,669
And since then, game development has only become even more accessible, and we're just seeing so many more games.

349
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:23,091
Games that are willing to do things differently.

350
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:27,333
Games that are personal and human, and games that push the boundaries of what a game even is.

351
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:31,675
And this is the festival to celebrate and champion those games.

352
00:27:31,675 --> 00:27:36,498
So as someone who has always looked up to the games in this festival, it really is an honor to present the nominees.

353
00:27:36,498 --> 00:27:38,659
So without further ado, here they are.

354
00:27:46,524 --> 00:27:49,705
Seamus McNally Grand Prize.

355
00:27:49,705 --> 00:27:55,527
Paradise Killer, developed by Kaizen Gameworks.

356
00:27:55,527 --> 00:27:59,768

357
00:27:59,768 --> 00:28:04,369
Phil Crabtree.

358
00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:05,549
Rachel Noy.

359
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:09,110
Teardown, developed by Tuxedo Labs.

360
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:30,448

361
00:28:30,448 --> 00:28:38,010
Genesis, developed by Carol.

362
00:28:49,713 --> 00:28:57,639
Umurangi Generation, developed by Origami Degro.

363
00:28:57,639 --> 00:29:05,146
Naftali Faulkner, Thor Heemster.

364
00:29:05,146 --> 00:29:08,388
Spirit Bearer, developed by Thunder Lotus.

365
00:29:08,388 --> 00:29:13,272
Nicolas Guerand, Joe Gauthier, Alex Boyer,

366
00:29:13,272 --> 00:29:18,157
Alexander Monette Martin.

367
00:29:25,005 --> 00:29:40,090
And the winner is...

368
00:29:55,423 --> 00:30:02,987
Anyway, I want to thank everyone today for the win on the grand prize at the IGF.

369
00:30:02,987 --> 00:30:09,270
This is a huge accomplishment that, you know, we're really happy to, like it's blown us away.

370
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:14,053
And when I say us, I mean, you know, me and Thor. Thor being the composer who totally smashed it

371
00:30:14,053 --> 00:30:18,715
with the soundtrack, getting the tone of that right for the stuff he composed and

372
00:30:18,715 --> 00:30:24,918
just the general mood of the music. You know, I want to thank

373
00:30:25,515 --> 00:30:33,281
players as well with this. I think, you know, that they've been really able to sort of help

374
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:39,204
us move into the space. And, you know, I don't think it's a coincidence that we won this

375
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:44,028
with them because, like I would just say that there has been a lot of times where they've

376
00:30:44,028 --> 00:30:44,968
really helped me out.

377
00:30:45,914 --> 00:30:50,438
I've really not been afraid to ask questions and they've been able to provide me with all

378
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:52,079
the support on that.

379
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:53,540
So I want to really thank them.

380
00:30:53,540 --> 00:31:00,746
Just a car going past and I would just say it has been a really rough year for a lot

381
00:31:00,746 --> 00:31:01,246
of people.

382
00:31:01,246 --> 00:31:05,230
That's why I'm recording it outside so we can all remember what that looks like.

383
00:31:05,903 --> 00:31:13,530
But yeah, I'd like to thank not just Thor and Playism, but also my partner for putting up with my late hours.

384
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:23,057
I'd like to thank Professor Norm Sheen for sharing with me a different way of doing design, which ended up in forming this game.

385
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:30,742
I'd like to thank Julia Faulkner for, you know, sitting and painting with me all those times.

386
00:31:30,742 --> 00:31:34,284
And, you know, everyone else sort of met along the way.

387
00:31:34,284 --> 00:31:36,065
There's literally a giant list, you know.

388
00:31:36,065 --> 00:31:40,367
This is an indie game that was made by, you know, one to two people.

389
00:31:41,074 --> 00:31:47,999
But, you know, the people that we are, are always informed by the people we meet along the way.

390
00:31:47,999 --> 00:31:51,541
So, you know, we never downplay in that respect.

391
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:56,285
So I'd just like to say once again, thank you for this grand prize win.

392
00:31:56,285 --> 00:31:58,727
And, you know, here's hoping for next time as well.

393
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:06,048
And that's it. We are at the end of the IGFs.

394
00:32:06,048 --> 00:32:08,729
Thank you for tuning in from wherever you are.

395
00:32:08,729 --> 00:32:11,291
And to the winners, huge congratulations.

396
00:32:11,291 --> 00:32:13,513
And to the nominees, huge congratulations.

397
00:32:13,513 --> 00:32:15,835
And to people who weren't even nominated.

398
00:32:16,508 --> 00:32:18,329
Also, giant congratulations.

399
00:32:18,329 --> 00:32:21,011
Just take all the congratulations.

400
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:24,792
It takes a lot to put out a game and you did it.

401
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:27,974
But, but, but there are also a ton of people

402
00:32:27,974 --> 00:32:29,875
who aren't recognized at these awards.

403
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:33,236
So to all the people who do QA, community managers,

404
00:32:33,236 --> 00:32:36,938
localization, UI designers, moderators,

405
00:32:36,938 --> 00:32:39,779
and everyone else who often gets overlooked in these things,

406
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,180
thank you for doing what you do.

407
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,320
You fricking rock.

408
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:48,543
We would all be perishing without you and I am very passionate about thanking you right now.

409
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:58,128
Have an award. Here you go. I'll photoshop an award right here. Or here. I'll photoshop two awards.

410
00:32:58,855 --> 00:33:04,318
that I guess I have to hand draw so that I don't run into any IP contractual errors.

411
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:07,060
Congratulations! You've won these awards!

412
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:11,182
And as a little bit of a parting message,

413
00:33:11,182 --> 00:33:13,524
I hope we all can continue creating a home for people.

414
00:33:13,524 --> 00:33:18,967
And that we continue amplifying and supporting diverse stories and the people that make them.

415
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:21,909
To dream and care so much about the world you create.

416
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:24,370
Thank you for giving so many of us a home.

417
00:33:25,231 --> 00:33:29,572
And finally, a huge thank you to our IGF Platinum sponsor,

418
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:30,132
ID at Xbox.

419
00:33:30,132 --> 00:33:32,833
You make this all possible.

420
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:34,414
Thank you for supporting indies.

421
00:33:34,414 --> 00:33:35,554
Woo!

422
00:33:35,554 --> 00:33:38,315
We did it!

423
00:33:38,315 --> 00:33:41,136
Ah!

424
00:33:41,136 --> 00:33:45,617
Bam!

425
00:33:45,617 --> 00:33:46,418
Hi there.

426
00:33:46,418 --> 00:33:48,518
I'm an exorbitantly paid Canadian

427
00:33:48,518 --> 00:33:51,339
with an overinflated sense of self-importance

428
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:54,800
here to host the industry's most important awards, which

429
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,100
No, not that one.

430
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:56,340
Oh, no, no.

431
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,721
I see now how that could have been confusing.

432
00:34:00,721 --> 00:34:01,542
OK, hang on.

433
00:34:01,542 --> 00:34:02,502
I'll take it from the top.

434
00:34:02,502 --> 00:34:03,542
Hi, everyone.

435
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:07,643
I'm Sam Maggs, and welcome to the 21st Annual Game Developers

436
00:34:07,643 --> 00:34:08,884
Choice Awards.

437
00:34:08,884 --> 00:34:12,165
As a dev myself, I'm honored to be hosting these awards,

438
00:34:12,165 --> 00:34:15,606
especially in a year when we needed games more than ever

439
00:34:15,606 --> 00:34:16,866
to help get us through quarantine.

440
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:20,567
Personally, my sanity was saved by phasmophobia,

441
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:21,908
no matter how ironic that may be.

442
00:34:22,558 --> 00:34:28,322
I also want to preface this ceremony by saying that while I understand that it might be uncomfortable

443
00:34:28,322 --> 00:34:35,087
or even confusing to see a woman on stage for the entirety of a gaming event, I have

444
00:34:35,087 --> 00:34:41,711
donned the customary blazer over graphic t-shirt in order to make everyone feel as at home

445
00:34:41,711 --> 00:34:42,391
as possible.

446
00:34:42,391 --> 00:34:47,615
I contemplated also being terrible at reading teleprompter, but then I remembered that I'm

447
00:34:47,615 --> 00:34:50,137
filming this in my own office and I don't have one, so.

448
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:52,473
This is as good as it's going to get.

449
00:34:52,473 --> 00:34:56,494
The GDC Awards are the premier accolades

450
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:58,574
for peer recognition in the games industry.

451
00:34:58,574 --> 00:35:01,495
And what's that?

452
00:35:01,495 --> 00:35:03,476
Marketing says we have to launch right now.

453
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,336
No, I thought we had another year in development.

454
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,777
The awards aren't ready to...

455
00:35:07,777 --> 00:35:08,557
You know what?

456
00:35:08,557 --> 00:35:09,537
We're fine.

457
00:35:09,537 --> 00:35:09,898
We're fine.

458
00:35:09,898 --> 00:35:10,678
One second.

459
00:35:29,643 --> 00:35:38,853
Yeah, we're ready. Let's go.

460
00:35:50,868 --> 00:35:53,189
Hi, hi, is this executive leadership?

461
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:54,209
Hi, yeah, it's Sam, the host.

462
00:35:54,209 --> 00:35:56,410
Yes, that's me, hi, hi.

463
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:00,090
I think there might've been a bit of a mix up.

464
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:05,291
See, we are here to celebrate games that already came out,

465
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:08,132
not to get hype over games that haven't come out yet.

466
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,512
You know, it just seems counterintuitive

467
00:36:09,512 --> 00:36:11,953
and maybe a little bit disrespectful to the whole.

468
00:36:11,953 --> 00:36:14,373
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

469
00:36:15,397 --> 00:36:23,161
Yeah, yeah, I mean, obviously I want people to suck up to me and show me exclusives, but I'm not, you know, I...

470
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:24,742
No, no, no, no, I'm not being argumentative. I...

471
00:36:24,742 --> 00:36:29,924
No, I'm not getting emotional. I'm just a woman. This is just what my voice sounds like.

472
00:36:29,924 --> 00:36:32,746
No, I'm not not being a team player. I just...

473
00:36:32,746 --> 00:36:36,027
Yes, we will talk about this later.

474
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,968
Okay, uh, thanks so much.

475
00:36:36,968 --> 00:36:44,792
Um, uh, in the meantime, let's celebrate all the premieres that people loved that came out over this past year.

476
00:36:52,198 --> 00:36:52,979

Ian Mudd.

494
00:38:36,952 --> 00:38:40,994
No, no, I got it. I got it. Let's try it. I can do it in one. It's fine.

495
00:38:40,994 --> 00:38:41,275
Okay.

496
00:38:41,275 --> 00:38:41,895
Hmm.

497
00:38:41,895 --> 00:38:47,798
Our next award is absolutely poggers.

498
00:38:47,798 --> 00:38:49,999
These nominees dabbed on their competition.

499
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:54,382
So get ready to get gatchy hyper and spam Ws in chat for-

500
00:38:54,382 --> 00:38:56,383
No, I can't do it. I can't do it!

501
00:38:56,383 --> 00:38:59,444
It's gonna age super badly. It's not even good now.

502
00:38:59,444 --> 00:39:02,286
Do we really want to be using memes in our-

503
00:39:02,805 --> 00:39:08,587
No, I mean, I think streamers know that devs appreciate them enough without us having to talk down to them like they're-

504
00:39:08,587 --> 00:39:12,289
Wait, what award is this even for anyways?

505
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:14,009
Oh.

506
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:14,790
Oh.

507
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,130
Ahaha.

508
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:16,390
Uh, well.

509
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:24,494
Big thanks to all our subs who voted with their bits for our Audience Award!

510
00:39:24,494 --> 00:39:26,035
Yay!

511
00:39:32,825 --> 00:39:34,366
And the winner is... âªâª âªâª

512
00:39:34,366 --> 00:39:45,954
âªâª âªâª Thank you so much for this audience award.

513
00:39:45,954 --> 00:39:53,920
Of course, all of us that make video games, we started out as members of the audience, right?

514
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,984
We played video games that moved us emotionally, that really excited our creativity,

515
00:39:59,984 --> 00:40:01,605
and inspired us.

516
00:40:02,002 --> 00:40:05,024
to want to pay it forward, to make games ourselves.

517
00:40:05,024 --> 00:40:07,366
And so getting this award, it means that

518
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:10,509
with Ghost of Tsushima, did a good job.

519
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:12,150
And that feels amazing.

520
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,772
I know from all of us at Sucker Punch,

521
00:40:14,772 --> 00:40:17,654
we want to thank you for giving us your time.

522
00:40:17,654 --> 00:40:21,317
There are a lot of fantastic games out there

523
00:40:21,317 --> 00:40:22,838
and you played Ghost.

524
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,560
Hopefully we've inspired you to go forth

525
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,502
and make the next game that inspires the next person

526
00:40:28,502 --> 00:40:29,783
and so on and so forth.

527
00:40:30,707 --> 00:40:33,799
Because video games are beautiful and we should all pay it forward.

528
00:41:53,396 --> 00:41:57,078
Best Technology.

00:41:57,078 --> 00:41:57,738

544
00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:27,862
This is.

545
00:43:27,862 --> 00:43:29,164
Hi, my name is JÃ¶rg Neumann.

546
00:43:29,164 --> 00:43:31,007
I'm the head of Microsoft Flight Simulator.

547
00:43:31,955 --> 00:43:36,256
When we first unveiled the trailer for the new simulator back at E3 2019,

548
00:43:36,256 --> 00:43:41,037
we could have not imagined the positive and wonderful response from the community.

549
00:43:41,037 --> 00:43:45,418
From our global preview event to our tech alpha and betas,

550
00:43:45,418 --> 00:43:49,260
to launch at many world and sim updates, it has been an amazing journey.

551
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:53,301
It is humbling to see how many fans have embraced the sim,

552
00:43:53,301 --> 00:43:58,102
and this award celebrates the passion the teams at Asobo,

553
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:00,883
Xbox, Bing, and many others have for this franchise.

554
00:44:01,678 --> 00:44:09,642
I would be remiss not to recognize and thank all the many talented developers who have contributed to this franchise over the last 39 years.

555
00:44:09,642 --> 00:44:13,744
And the contributions go beyond the core development team.

556
00:44:13,744 --> 00:44:20,607
So many third-party developers have elevated and expanded not only Microsoft Flight Simulator, but the genre as a whole.

557
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:25,370
With many amazing mods and add-ons that delight fans around the world.

558
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:30,873
On behalf of every developer who's contributed to Microsoft Flight Simulator, thank you.

559
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:47,178
Where do you even start with Tom Fulp?

560
00:44:47,178 --> 00:44:47,198
I...

561
00:44:47,198 --> 00:44:47,898
The guy's a legend.

562
00:44:47,898 --> 00:44:55,240
He's done more single-handedly for the gaming and entertainment industry as a whole than...

563
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,302
And there's not enough time in the day, is what I'm saying, to talk about Tom Fulp.

564
00:44:59,302 --> 00:45:00,262
But we'll try anyway.

565
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:01,082
Um...

566
00:45:01,082 --> 00:45:02,302
Tom Fulp.

567
00:45:02,302 --> 00:45:03,643
Husband to a badass wife.

568
00:45:03,643 --> 00:45:05,403
Father of two awesome kids.

569
00:45:06,815 --> 00:45:11,116
Three, if you consider the black sheep, newgrounds.com.

570
00:45:11,116 --> 00:45:15,537
The lost boy that never quite grew up.

571
00:45:15,537 --> 00:45:18,678
See you don't talk about Tom Foulke without bringing up Newgrounds.

572
00:45:18,678 --> 00:45:23,819
So years before YouTube was a thing, Newgrounds was the website where you would go to find

573
00:45:23,819 --> 00:45:27,640
all of the newest cartoons and games from your favorite online creators.

574
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,241
And it was all a completely self-regulated system.

575
00:45:30,241 --> 00:45:34,902
All judgments, all content had to go through an approval process that was regulated by

576
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:35,622
the users.

577
00:45:35,622 --> 00:45:36,322
It was amazing.

578
00:45:37,062 --> 00:45:39,645
No one had quite seen something just like that before.

579
00:45:39,645 --> 00:45:42,167
It's where you went for everything.

580
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:43,368
By everyone.

581
00:45:43,368 --> 00:45:44,809
And it still is.

582
00:45:44,809 --> 00:45:48,012
Even now, after Adobe's closed its doors on Flash forever,

583
00:45:48,012 --> 00:45:50,575
Newgrounds is still somehow thriving.

584
00:45:50,575 --> 00:45:56,580
It's a testament to the man's enduring image of what games and entertainment actually are.

585
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:02,065
And what began as a basement-run website in the mid-90s has now...

586
00:46:02,765 --> 00:46:09,548
over the last decade become the industry foot in the door for hundreds upon hundreds of creators

587
00:46:09,548 --> 00:46:13,850
trying to get into the games and animation industries, or even just entertainment.

588
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:17,432
People like myself, who owe everything to what Newgrounds has done for them.

589
00:46:17,432 --> 00:46:20,854
Tom also co-founded The Behemoth, the game development company,

590
00:46:20,854 --> 00:46:25,776
and you know them if you've played Alien Hominid or Castle Crashers.

591
00:46:26,901 --> 00:46:29,345
That's right. That was him and

592
00:46:29,345 --> 00:46:35,415
He didn't just oversee production. He made those games. Look at the end of the day Tom Fulp may not be the

593
00:46:35,415 --> 00:46:37,979
father of the internet, but

594
00:46:38,888 --> 00:46:49,453
If you've ever shared your creative content online for other people to enjoy, or opened up your browser to see how far you could launch a cartoon animal.

595
00:46:49,453 --> 00:46:51,494
If you've ever quoted to your friends,

596
00:46:51,494 --> 00:46:52,795
We're on a bridge, Charlie!

597
00:46:52,795 --> 00:46:54,535
Or, I like rusty spoons!

598
00:46:54,535 --> 00:46:57,257
Or, all your bass are belong to us.

599
00:46:57,257 --> 00:47:02,459
If you've ever done any of these things, if it applies to you, then Tom Fulp is the father of the internet that you know.

600
00:47:02,459 --> 00:47:05,881
He's also a hot dad, so that's kind of cool.

601
00:47:05,881 --> 00:47:08,162
Congratulations, Tom.

602
00:47:10,857 --> 00:47:13,379
Hey everyone, it's really great to be here.

603
00:47:13,379 --> 00:47:15,601
All my life, I dreamed of making games,

604
00:47:15,601 --> 00:47:18,824
but I dreamed about it the way a kid dreams

605
00:47:18,824 --> 00:47:21,727
about being a superhero, where you don't think

606
00:47:21,727 --> 00:47:24,089
it would actually happen in reality.

607
00:47:24,089 --> 00:47:27,472
So it's kind of surreal to be here right now,

608
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:31,676
winning this award and having gotten to make games.

609
00:47:31,676 --> 00:47:34,959
So I'd like to thank GDC for choosing me.

610
00:47:34,959 --> 00:47:36,020
It's been a huge honor.

611
00:47:37,894 --> 00:47:43,420
If it wasn't for Flash, I don't know if I would have had the opportunity to live out this dream.

612
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:46,423
And I think a lot of people share the same sort of story.

613
00:47:46,423 --> 00:47:51,087
Flash and the internet was a game changer that allowed people to make games who otherwise

614
00:47:51,087 --> 00:47:55,412
might not have, and that energy is what drove Newgrounds and continues to carry it forward

615
00:47:55,412 --> 00:47:56,593
to this day.

616
00:47:57,466 --> 00:48:02,829
I'd like to thank Ross Snyder for bringing his programming expertise to the Newgrounds portal,

617
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:07,432
allowing people to instantly publish their games in animation, which was a big thing in the year 2000.

618
00:48:07,432 --> 00:48:10,353
It's really exciting times, building out that system.

619
00:48:10,353 --> 00:48:14,475
I'd like to thank all the pioneers who shared their flash on Newgrounds.

620
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:18,598
We were all kind of inspiring each other and making each other up our game all the time.

621
00:48:20,102 --> 00:48:24,806
Along the way, I had the good fortune of teaming up with John Baez and Dan Paladin to form

622
00:48:24,806 --> 00:48:29,409
The Behemoth, where I got to make console games like Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers.

623
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:33,712
And it's been really rewarding to see other people from the Flash scene go along the same

624
00:48:33,712 --> 00:48:39,156
sort of journey with their games like The Binding of Isaac, Among Us, Rogue Legacy,

625
00:48:39,156 --> 00:48:41,218
Super Meat Boy, and now Friday Night Funkin'.

626
00:48:42,202 --> 00:48:47,064
There's been a lot of twists and turns along the way, including the death of Flash.

627
00:48:47,064 --> 00:48:50,846
With that, I'd like to thank Mike Welsh and everyone who works on Ruffle.

628
00:48:50,846 --> 00:48:56,069
Ruffle is an open source Flash player that's bringing more and more Flash games back to the

629
00:48:56,069 --> 00:49:02,693
web. And over time, we risk losing a lot of games to history. So I think we should all thank everyone

630
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:07,836
working in game preservation in general. Increasingly feels like preserving old games is just

631
00:49:07,836 --> 00:49:09,677
as important as making new games.

632
00:49:11,153 --> 00:49:16,216
As for me, I'm still making games and I look forward to sharing Nightmare Cops with everyone when it's done.

633
00:49:16,216 --> 00:49:26,441
And for all of you working year after year on your own dream games, I see you and good luck and we'll all get there eventually.

634
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:30,263
To wrap this up, thank you again for this award and I'll see you on the internet.

635
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:37,281
Our next award is for Best Narrative.

636
00:49:37,281 --> 00:49:40,183
As a game writer myself, this category is...

637
00:49:40,183 --> 00:49:40,483
Oh my gosh.

638
00:49:40,483 --> 00:49:42,605
Oh my gosh, that's our publisher.

639
00:49:42,605 --> 00:49:45,467
Oh, I'm so sorry. I have to take this.

640
00:49:45,467 --> 00:49:46,068
Hello?

641
00:49:46,068 --> 00:49:48,029
You, the writer. I'm glad you're free.

642
00:49:48,029 --> 00:49:51,772
Um, actually, I was kind of in the middle of something, but...

643
00:49:51,772 --> 00:49:52,933
Have you ever watched Titanic?

644
00:49:52,933 --> 00:49:53,614
Uh, yeah. I mean...

645
00:49:53,614 --> 00:49:57,657
Wonderful. I've just watched it for the first time today.

646
00:49:57,657 --> 00:50:01,940
I feel like you should rewrite everything to be more like the movie Titanic.

647
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:07,108
You want me to rewrite the GDC awards so they're more like... Titanic.

648
00:50:07,108 --> 00:50:09,149
Yes! Exactly. I'm glad we're on the same page.

649
00:50:09,149 --> 00:50:14,470
It's just that I'm actually currently presenting the GDC awards, so it feels like

650
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:19,592
it's a little late to be making that kind of like fundamental change to our-

651
00:50:19,592 --> 00:50:23,314
Right! I know you can do it. I'll check back in an hour.

652
00:50:23,314 --> 00:50:27,375
Right. Well, while I get to work on that, here are our nominees for Best Narrative.

653
00:50:32,463 --> 00:50:33,683

Take a look.

685
00:52:20,067 --> 00:52:21,148
I thought I'd do an outfit change.

686
00:52:21,148 --> 00:52:23,088
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what do you think?

687
00:52:23,088 --> 00:52:24,449
With blazer or without blazer?

688
00:52:24,449 --> 00:52:27,390
You think you want to see without blazer?

689
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:28,351
Okay, okay, hang on, hang on.

690
00:52:28,351 --> 00:52:28,771
I'll digit it.

691
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,412
There, what do you think?

692
00:52:30,412 --> 00:52:31,352
Yeah?

693
00:52:31,352 --> 00:52:35,214
Better without, I think without blazer?

694
00:52:35,214 --> 00:52:36,354
Yeah, okay, we'll mix it up.

695
00:52:36,354 --> 00:52:38,875
We'll do without blazer, okay.

696
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:39,255
Here we go.

697
00:52:41,262 --> 00:52:47,684
Games would be nothing without the beautiful soundscapes created by our incredibly talented audio departments.

698
00:52:47,684 --> 00:52:53,927
Plus, their soundproofing needs mean they always get the best and most private offices in the studio.

699
00:52:53,927 --> 00:52:56,747
And for that, the rest of us are immensely jealous.

700
00:52:56,747 --> 00:53:03,350
Here are the nominees for Best Audio.

701
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:03,930
Best Audio

702
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:04,390
Best Audio

703
00:53:11,297 --> 00:53:16,319
Developed by Supergiant Games, Darren Ford.

704
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:17,900

00:53:21,321 --> 00:53:27,224
Published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

707
00:53:27,224 --> 00:53:32,106
The Naughty Dog Development Team.

708
00:53:37,617 --> 00:53:44,540
Doom Eternal, developed by Kade Software, published by Bethesda Softworks.

709
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:52,222
Hugo Martin, Marty Stratton, Mick Gordon, Chad Mossholder.

710
00:53:52,222 --> 00:53:58,485
Final Fantasy VII Remake, developed by Square Enix.

711
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,845
Makoto Issei.

712
00:54:07,725 --> 00:54:10,166
Ghost of Tsushima

713
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:14,869
Developed by Sucker Punch Productions

714
00:54:14,869 --> 00:54:25,073
Published by Sony Interactive Entertainment

715
00:54:25,073 --> 00:54:26,634
And the winner is

716
00:54:38,628 --> 00:54:41,449
I want to say thank you so much to the Game Developers Choice Awards.

717
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:46,771
It is really incredible to be honored in a category with these incredible games.

718
00:54:46,771 --> 00:54:52,273
And this is Regis here who helped bring Cerberus to life along with the dogs of several other

719
00:54:52,273 --> 00:54:52,853
team members.

720
00:54:52,853 --> 00:54:57,095
So I want to say thank you to all the team dogs for all the love and support on this

721
00:54:57,095 --> 00:54:57,935
project.

722
00:54:57,935 --> 00:55:03,637
And I want to say thank you to our incredible families for putting up with a lot of this

723
00:55:03,637 --> 00:55:05,778
work being done in our homes towards the end of the project.

724
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:10,742
And I want to say thank you to my incredible team at Supergiant Games

725
00:55:10,742 --> 00:55:16,966
for being some of the most wonderful and talented people that I know.

726
00:55:16,966 --> 00:55:21,670
And it is really a joy to do what I do every day

727
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:26,694
and to be able to call it my job. So thank you so much.

728
00:55:26,694 --> 00:55:31,298
VR and AR games are more realistic than ever, completely disrupting our idea of

729
00:55:31,298 --> 00:55:32,759
what reality even is.

730
00:55:32,759 --> 00:55:35,461
Hi, this is Jason Schreier calling from Bloomberg News.

731
00:55:37,049 --> 00:55:39,310
Uh, hi?

732
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:41,892
Yeah, I'm just calling for comment on a story.

733
00:55:41,892 --> 00:55:43,813
What kind of story?

734
00:55:43,813 --> 00:55:48,675
So I've heard from two sources that this awards show is a bit of a disaster.

735
00:55:48,675 --> 00:55:51,777
Really? I mean, it's gone a little off the rails, but I don't think it's too, like-

736
00:55:51,777 --> 00:55:54,879
Do you want to chat? I'd be happy to keep you anonymous.

737
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,780
I'm in the middle of hosting!

738
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:00,802
Yeah, I just think our readers deserve to know what's really happening here.

739
00:56:00,802 --> 00:56:04,444
You know I can't talk to you! Oh my god, how do I turn this off?

740
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,825
They're calling this the Anthem of Award Shows.

741
00:56:06,825 --> 00:56:06,885
Ugh!

742
00:56:07,461 --> 00:56:09,423
Can someone please call IT?

743
00:56:09,423 --> 00:56:10,423
What even just happened?

744
00:56:10,423 --> 00:56:13,806
Um, anyways, here's our nominees for Best VR AR Game.

745
00:56:13,806 --> 00:56:19,091
Was that even real?

746
00:56:19,091 --> 00:56:23,755
Best VR AR Game

747
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:26,417
The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners

748
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:28,899
Developed by Skydance Interactive

749
00:56:28,899 --> 00:56:30,600
Peter Ackman

750
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:33,323
Mark Domwitz

751
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:34,784
Todd Adamson

752
00:56:34,784 --> 00:56:35,725
Jesse Young

753
00:56:38,572 --> 00:56:51,759
Paper Beast, developed by Pixel Reef, Eric Chahi.

754
00:56:51,759 --> 00:56:56,061
Dreams, developed by Media Molecule,

755
00:56:56,061 --> 00:57:01,423
published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

756
00:57:09,918 --> 00:57:13,040
You will not save him.

757
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,841
Don't worry, it's unloaded.

758
00:57:15,841 --> 00:57:19,943
It's unloaded now!

759
00:57:19,943 --> 00:57:23,344
All this is my fault.

760
00:57:23,344 --> 00:57:26,025
I never told you.

761
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:30,387
I couldn't. I'm so sorry, baby.

762
00:58:39,408 --> 00:58:42,452
It is my distinct honor to introduce Laura Lynn.

763
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:46,597
I count her as a close friend, an amazing game maker, and a superlative human being.

764
00:58:46,597 --> 00:58:50,502
Laura Lynn has quietly been elevating the work of anyone with the good fortune to be

765
00:58:50,502 --> 00:58:52,605
her teammate over the last three decades.

766
00:58:52,605 --> 00:58:56,310
Her humility, talent, and perseverance are in such abundance that she has enough of

767
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:57,832
each to share with everyone around her.

768
00:58:58,787 --> 00:59:00,889
After a couple of attempts at starting her own companies,

769
00:59:00,889 --> 00:59:03,513
she eventually joined another studio on the design team,

770
00:59:03,513 --> 00:59:05,776
and soon thereafter became the lead designer

771
00:59:05,776 --> 00:59:06,817
on Full Spectrum Warrior,

772
00:59:06,817 --> 00:59:09,220
where she and her team delivered a top-tier squad game

773
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:12,765
in the vein of XCOM that delivered innovations in gameplay

774
00:59:12,765 --> 00:59:15,088
and user experience that garnered best-of noms

775
00:59:15,088 --> 00:59:17,051
and player adulation on its release.

776
00:59:17,558 --> 00:59:22,160
Not content to rest on her successes, she moved over to Sony Online where she became

777
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,643
creative director of an ambitious MMO, Free Realms, aimed at bringing a whole new audience

778
00:59:26,643 --> 00:59:30,845
and generation of players to the game, as well as a new way of involving those players

779
00:59:30,845 --> 00:59:31,866
in their own storytelling.

780
00:59:32,378 --> 00:59:36,199
It's hard to overstate the accomplishments and success of Free Realms when it released in 2011.

781
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:43,461
It was free to play, play-available the web, player advancement was multifaceted and not solely dependent on combat,

782
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:50,984
avatar customization was expansive, player self-expression and cooperative storytelling were at the center of its goals and its successes.

783
00:59:50,984 --> 00:59:54,244
It was wildly popular, reaching over 10 million players at its peak.

784
00:59:54,244 --> 00:59:59,046
We're still seeing reverberations from this title 10 years on throughout the MMO and free-to-play sectors.

785
00:59:59,046 --> 01:00:01,907
More recently, she really landed as chief creative officer.

786
01:00:02,264 --> 01:00:06,886
Skydance Interactive, where she explored and set the groundwork for innovative storytelling in the

787
01:00:06,886 --> 01:00:11,009
wildly successful VR title, The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners. Without the foundation

788
01:00:11,009 --> 01:00:16,131
Laura Lynn had laid, it would have been easy to let the technological and gameplay accomplishments

789
01:00:16,131 --> 01:00:20,233
of Saints and Sinners overshadow the humanity of the game. Throughout her career, Laura Lynn

790
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:25,196
has challenged herself and her teammates and her craft at every opportunity, looking for ways to

791
01:00:25,196 --> 01:00:28,718
further storytelling and interactivity in that eclectic marriage that is game making.

792
01:00:29,371 --> 01:00:35,014
Modern game making is a collaborative effort, one that benefits from people who know how to bring out the best in everyone on the team,

793
01:00:35,014 --> 01:00:40,918
who always keep players in mind as we engage in our craft, and who never lose sight of the excitement that playing games can bring.

794
01:00:40,918 --> 01:00:47,561
I can't think of somebody who better embodies this and more deserves recognition for modeling what a game maker should be than Laura Lin.

795
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,282
Congratulations, Laura Lin.

796
01:00:51,461 --> 01:00:53,762
I feel like saying thank you isn't nearly enough,

797
01:00:53,762 --> 01:00:55,523
especially considering the people

798
01:00:55,523 --> 01:00:57,765
who have gotten this award before me.

799
01:00:57,765 --> 01:00:59,045
And that thank you isn't just

800
01:00:59,045 --> 01:01:01,127
for the Game Developers Choice Committee,

801
01:01:01,127 --> 01:01:02,848
but for everyone I've ever worked alongside

802
01:01:02,848 --> 01:01:05,369
and everyone who's supported me over the years.

803
01:01:05,369 --> 01:01:07,310
I genuinely can't wrap my head around this honor.

804
01:01:08,562 --> 01:01:12,443
But in this moment, I also can't help thinking of my path to get here.

805
01:01:12,443 --> 01:01:16,304
As a young kid, I always thought attractions like Pirates of the Caribbean were magic,

806
01:01:16,304 --> 01:01:18,024
living, immersive stories.

807
01:01:18,024 --> 01:01:21,665
But then around 1980, I got this weird new game called Adventureland from my home computer.

808
01:01:21,665 --> 01:01:25,586
It was a text adventure, a living story that was actually interactive,

809
01:01:25,586 --> 01:01:28,647
where I could make choices and those choices mattered.

810
01:01:28,647 --> 01:01:30,207
Now, that was magic.

811
01:01:30,642 --> 01:01:35,084
I immediately started making my own text adventure, a romance game where you were stranded on

812
01:01:35,084 --> 01:01:38,726
an island with a cute guy, because I was 16.

813
01:01:38,726 --> 01:01:44,589
But even then, I knew exactly what I was supposed to be doing with the rest of my life, making

814
01:01:44,589 --> 01:01:44,749
games.

815
01:01:44,749 --> 01:01:45,709
But how?

816
01:01:45,709 --> 01:01:50,212
So I did a bunch of other stuff, but then in 1993, everything changed when I played

817
01:01:50,212 --> 01:01:50,712
Myst.

818
01:01:50,712 --> 01:01:54,834
They'd made a living, breathing, interactive world, and now it looked real.

819
01:01:55,684 --> 01:01:57,344
I couldn't take it anymore.

820
01:01:57,344 --> 01:01:59,905
I taught myself 3D graphics, I improved my scripting,

821
01:01:59,905 --> 01:02:01,665
I made a demo, I sold it to Microprose

822
01:02:01,665 --> 01:02:03,346
and started my own company.

823
01:02:03,346 --> 01:02:06,787
And then two years later, my very first game was canceled.

824
01:02:06,787 --> 01:02:08,607
My second game was canceled too,

825
01:02:08,607 --> 01:02:10,367
so welcome to game development.

826
01:02:10,367 --> 01:02:13,448
It's been almost 30 years since then,

827
01:02:13,448 --> 01:02:15,509
and 41 years since I first played Adventureland.

828
01:02:15,509 --> 01:02:19,590
And I still get up every morning, a couple hours early,

829
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:22,310
even if that means 6 a.m., so I have time to play games.

830
01:02:23,069 --> 01:02:26,830
And even now, after all this time, when I sit down to play Returnal or replay Prey or

831
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:30,392
dive headfirst back into Mass Effect, it's still magic.

832
01:02:30,392 --> 01:02:33,733
So I'll leave you with one thought.

833
01:02:33,733 --> 01:02:35,113
We're all wizards.

834
01:02:35,113 --> 01:02:35,453
All of us.

835
01:02:35,453 --> 01:02:39,775
No matter how experienced we are, no matter what our role is or what kind of games we're

836
01:02:39,775 --> 01:02:44,357
building or who those games are for, we all make magic.

837
01:02:44,357 --> 01:02:47,078
But that magic comes from unexpected places.

838
01:02:47,753 --> 01:02:50,155
I never studied computer science or art in school,

839
01:02:50,155 --> 01:02:51,957
and the concept of game designer as a role

840
01:02:51,957 --> 01:02:54,480
didn't even exist back then.

841
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:56,302
I was almost 30 when I started my career in games.

842
01:02:56,302 --> 01:02:58,725
In most companies at that time,

843
01:02:58,725 --> 01:03:01,608
I was one of one or two or maybe three women

844
01:03:01,608 --> 01:03:03,109
in the whole company,

845
01:03:03,109 --> 01:03:05,992
and almost always the only woman in a leadership role.

846
01:03:05,992 --> 01:03:09,136
So I know what it's like to be conspicuously different,

847
01:03:09,136 --> 01:03:10,337
and yet, here I am.

848
01:03:11,445 --> 01:03:15,687
We all have our own paths, our own ways to create magic for our players.

849
01:03:15,687 --> 01:03:19,588
And each one of those unique paths brings something special and new

850
01:03:19,588 --> 01:03:21,628
to the game and the team and the company.

851
01:03:21,628 --> 01:03:25,410
So my wish for all of us individuals and the industry as a whole

852
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:30,651
is that we'll keep taking risks and we'll grow and we'll welcome fellow wizards

853
01:03:30,651 --> 01:03:32,352
of all types and all paths.

854
01:03:32,352 --> 01:03:36,473
There's something to learn from each of us and in each of us, there's magic.

855
01:03:36,473 --> 01:03:39,314
So thank you again from the bottom of my heart.

856
01:03:44,632 --> 01:03:50,255
And now for everyone's favorite part of the awards ceremony.

857
01:03:50,255 --> 01:03:52,136
I'm sorry, does that say commercials?

858
01:03:52,136 --> 01:03:55,658
No, I mean, I'm just confused.

859
01:03:55,658 --> 01:03:58,640
Like video games are the biggest selling industry in the world.

860
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:02,002
I mean, we bring in like three times what box office does in a year,

861
01:04:02,002 --> 01:04:03,662
over seven times what music does.

862
01:04:03,662 --> 01:04:07,745
Why would we need to sell ad space during our awards ceremony?

863
01:04:07,745 --> 01:04:13,047
Where's all the money going?

864
01:04:13,047 --> 01:04:13,648
Right.

865
01:04:15,288 --> 01:04:20,791
Right. Okay, well, we're cutting that, and instead, this airspace is just gonna be me,

866
01:04:20,791 --> 01:04:23,333
smiling to camera, and saying,

867
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:25,194
UNIONIZE!

868
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:28,636
And now, the award for the industry's biggest money maker,

869
01:04:28,636 --> 01:04:33,139
accounting for nearly half of all money brought in by video games, period,

870
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:39,103
Best Mobile Game.

871
01:04:39,103 --> 01:04:43,245

Hello everyone, here is Hao Yutai.

889
01:06:17,172 --> 01:06:20,033
As the CEO and producer of MiHoYo,

890
01:06:20,033 --> 01:06:24,636
it's absolutely thrilling to accept the best mobile game

891
01:06:24,636 --> 01:06:27,517
of GDC Awards for Genshin Impact.

892
01:06:27,517 --> 01:06:32,380
It was a crazy idea to bring the open world

893
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:36,322
adventure experience to the mobile platform back in 2017.

894
01:06:36,322 --> 01:06:39,724
We made the launch of Genshin Impact

895
01:06:39,724 --> 01:06:41,065
in September last year.

896
01:06:41,587 --> 01:06:47,688
and was surprised to see Genshin Impact has been well received by our fans globally.

897
01:06:47,688 --> 01:06:52,750
So here today, I'd like to share this award with every team member

898
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:56,291
who has been working hard enough on this project.

899
01:06:56,291 --> 01:07:01,332
And most importantly, a big thank you to our fans globally

900
01:07:01,332 --> 01:07:04,233
who've been living in and supporting us.

901
01:07:04,233 --> 01:07:06,594
Without you, we cannot be here. Thank you.

902
01:07:10,575 --> 01:07:13,157
We have another award on deck here, but I just got a ping on Slack.

903
01:07:13,157 --> 01:07:15,458
So hang on a second. Let me just bring this up here.

904
01:07:15,458 --> 01:07:18,700
Okay, it's from Chad, our chief visionary creative.

905
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,562
Okay, let's see what he has to say.

906
01:07:20,562 --> 01:07:20,982
Hi, Sam.

907
01:07:20,982 --> 01:07:22,443
Been doing some thinking.

908
01:07:22,443 --> 01:07:26,706
Okay, I've been in the industry about 20 years now,

909
01:07:26,706 --> 01:07:29,148
and I've just had my first daughter.

910
01:07:29,148 --> 01:07:33,110
Starting to think that maybe women are people.

911
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:35,012
Haven't gotten too far into it yet,

912
01:07:35,012 --> 01:07:38,774
but we should pivot to make the awards about a middle-aged man

913
01:07:38,774 --> 01:07:39,915
becoming a father.

914
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:42,925
and dealing with his own daddy issues.

915
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:45,406
You are probably not the best fit for this, so...

916
01:07:45,406 --> 01:07:45,646
Uh-huh.

917
01:07:45,646 --> 01:07:47,386
You know what?

918
01:07:47,386 --> 01:07:51,108
I'm just going to set my status to away

919
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:52,748
and pretend that I never saw that.

920
01:07:52,748 --> 01:07:53,608
Okay.

921
01:07:53,608 --> 01:07:57,750
So, since creative leadership is clearly having a moment,

922
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:59,570
why don't we go ahead and take a look at the games

923
01:07:59,570 --> 01:08:02,731
that were objectively beautiful last year that we all loved?

924
01:08:02,731 --> 01:08:04,832
Oh my god, I'm gonna get fired.

925
01:08:10,943 --> 01:08:16,365
best visual art.

01:08:35,294 --> 01:08:36,054

927
01:08:36,054 --> 01:08:36,475
No, this...

928
01:08:36,475 --> 01:08:37,636

940
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:53,271
Hey everyone, it is an absolute honor to win this award for the best visual art.

941
01:09:53,271 --> 01:09:59,513
You know, it takes an entire team of, you know, super creative people at a studio, years

942
01:09:59,513 --> 01:10:06,295
of dedication and hard work, you know, a specific style and, you know, way that you'd like to

943
01:10:06,295 --> 01:10:10,836
depict a place like Feudal Japan, and honestly a lot of collaborating with

944
01:10:11,627 --> 01:10:14,667
you know, team members that maybe we've never worked with before.

945
01:10:14,667 --> 01:10:17,748
So I want to thank all of our consultants and our teammates in Japan

946
01:10:17,748 --> 01:10:20,749
that helped us make this game and give us feedback all over the, you know,

947
01:10:20,749 --> 01:10:23,289
the course of making this game over the last few years.

948
01:10:23,289 --> 01:10:27,450
And I just want to say thank you to our team, the character artists

949
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:31,151
and environment artists and the concept team and the animators

950
01:10:31,151 --> 01:10:35,532
and, you know, the visual development team, the lighting team,

951
01:10:35,532 --> 01:10:37,813
as well as the graphics engineers.

952
01:10:37,813 --> 01:10:41,233
Thank you so much for everything you've done to make this game great.

953
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:52,134
Thank you for this award. We're honored.

954
01:11:08,728 --> 01:11:10,669
Uh, no, I don't think so. Why?

955
01:11:10,669 --> 01:11:14,790
The guy who made that sitcom cracked the code on narrative.

956
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:17,150
He solved it. He made a chart.

957
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:19,751
We'll use this to plot out every intro for the ceremony.

958
01:11:19,751 --> 01:11:20,131
Every intro?

959
01:11:20,131 --> 01:11:24,031
I mean, I'm sure the chart is great.

960
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:28,932
It's probably just one of many tools in a writer's toolbox.

961
01:11:28,932 --> 01:11:32,213
Like, you know, if someone had really cracked the code on storytelling,

962
01:11:32,213 --> 01:11:33,593
we would all be doing it, so.

963
01:11:33,593 --> 01:11:36,334
Every other department I can measure their progress on a grid.

964
01:11:36,334 --> 01:11:36,854
Ugh.

965
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:43,396
Contractors. At least I don't have to pay you royalties, benefits, healthcare, really anything.

966
01:11:43,396 --> 01:11:57,550

And the winner is...

980
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:34,975
Thank you for this Game Developers Choice Award for Design.

981
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:38,196
First, we want to thank the video game Rogue,

982
01:13:38,196 --> 01:13:40,037
and all the Rogue-likes that came after it,

983
01:13:40,037 --> 01:13:42,038
which inspired us to see if we had something

984
01:13:42,038 --> 01:13:43,818
we could contribute here.

985
01:13:43,818 --> 01:13:44,999
We also want to thank our team,

986
01:13:44,999 --> 01:13:46,580
who elevates everything we do,

987
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,440
our players in early access,

988
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,641
who gave us invaluable feedback,

989
01:13:50,641 --> 01:13:52,282
and finally, our test maps.

990
01:13:52,282 --> 01:13:54,523
We spent a lot of time in our test maps

991
01:13:54,523 --> 01:13:56,484
trying to figure out what Hades would be,

992
01:13:56,484 --> 01:13:57,404
and when you're doing that,

993
01:13:57,404 --> 01:13:59,265
you have no idea that it's going to lead

994
01:13:59,265 --> 01:14:00,265
to something like this.

995
01:14:00,788 --> 01:14:07,573
So on behalf of Gavin, Greg, Eduardo, Alice, and myself, thank you so much.

996
01:14:07,573 --> 01:14:18,502
Let's take a pause now and remember those co-workers, colleagues, and friends whom we

997
01:14:18,502 --> 01:14:25,027
lost over this last year and remember the ways in which they added to our industry and to our lives.

998
01:14:33,363 --> 01:14:37,004
You

999
01:15:02,378 --> 01:15:05,879

1000
01:15:32,265 --> 01:15:49,024
Thank you for watching and for everything you do for us each day, we love you!

1002
01:17:17,269 --> 01:17:22,933
I don't want to introduce the Innovation Award. No, I don't want to. Okay, fine, if it's so easy,

1003
01:17:22,933 --> 01:17:27,356
then why don't you tell Naughty Dog they're not nominated for a whole category? Yeah,

1004
01:17:27,356 --> 01:17:32,080
yeah, that's what I thought. Mm-hmm, that's what I thought. Fine, fine, you know what,

1005
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:36,543
fine. Here, nominees for the Innovation Award. So I'm gonna go hide under my desk before the

1006
01:17:36,543 --> 01:17:37,924
Sony snipers find me. Bye.

1007
01:17:44,208 --> 01:17:46,930

I'd like to thank our friends and family at Sony for supporting us along this journey.

1020
01:19:29,736 --> 01:19:36,240
And, as always, it's the community that I have the most thanks to.

1021
01:19:36,834 --> 01:19:44,939
In many ways the success of our innovation in making dreams has been to empower the innovation of our community

1022
01:19:44,939 --> 01:19:48,422
and it brings us joy every day to see the things that they're making.

1023
01:19:54,040 --> 01:20:00,022
Now, any Game Awards ceremony wouldn't be complete without a deeply awkward celebrity cameo.

1024
01:20:00,022 --> 01:20:04,985
And for this year's GDC Awards, have we got a surprise for you.

1025
01:20:04,985 --> 01:20:09,547
So please, help me in welcoming...

1026
01:20:09,547 --> 01:20:11,988
What do you mean we don't have Mercer?

1027
01:20:11,988 --> 01:20:13,248
Well, what are we supposed to do?

1028
01:20:13,248 --> 01:20:15,489
He's the only voice actor anyone recognizes.

1029
01:20:15,489 --> 01:20:17,710
I don't know what we're supposed to...

1030
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:18,250
Okay, fine, fine.

1031
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:18,711
You know what? Fine.

1032
01:20:18,711 --> 01:20:22,272
Everyone, please help me welcome my producer, Leslie, to the stage.

1033
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:22,472
What?

1034
01:20:24,169 --> 01:20:25,592
Why am I on camera?

1035
01:20:25,592 --> 01:20:28,997
You are now our celebrity guest!

1036
01:20:28,997 --> 01:20:30,099
Say hi to the crowd!

1037
01:20:30,099 --> 01:20:33,205
Hi. Listen, we're way off the timeline here,

1038
01:20:33,205 --> 01:20:34,507
and unless we do some serious triage,

1039
01:20:34,507 --> 01:20:36,731
we're not going to be able to end the show in time.

1040
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:38,113
Did you make a Jira for that?

1041
01:20:40,851 --> 01:20:43,712
Producers do more than make Jiras.

1042
01:20:43,712 --> 01:20:45,692
Nothing would ship without producers.

1043
01:20:45,692 --> 01:20:47,452
I'm sorry?

1044
01:20:47,452 --> 01:20:50,273
Are you saying that without producers,

1045
01:20:50,273 --> 01:20:53,533
game writers would just throw down a bunch of random shit

1046
01:20:53,533 --> 01:20:56,174
that is completely unmakeable in-engine

1047
01:20:56,174 --> 01:20:59,095
and just assume that's gonna end up on screen

1048
01:20:59,095 --> 01:21:01,695
because we have a god complex?

1049
01:21:01,695 --> 01:21:02,895
Yes.

1050
01:21:02,895 --> 01:21:04,156
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1051
01:21:04,156 --> 01:21:05,976
Whatever, I have no idea what you're talking about.

1052
01:21:06,427 --> 01:21:14,854
Anyways, here's 14 unicorns swimming through an ocean of golden flower petals to announce our Game of the Year.

1053
01:21:14,854 --> 01:21:22,181
We can't afford that.

1054
01:21:22,181 --> 01:21:22,281
What?!

1055
01:21:22,281 --> 01:21:25,143
Game of the Year.

1061
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,420

Ghost of Tsushima.

1070
01:23:27,721 --> 01:23:29,722
The Mongols took it.

Published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

1074
01:23:40,347 --> 01:23:41,487
She can out-shoot any samurai I know.

1075
01:23:41,487 --> 01:23:41,907
I'm coming with you.

1076
01:23:41,907 --> 01:23:44,688
Now, send them to their ancestors.

1077
01:23:44,688 --> 01:23:46,969
Do you deserve death?

1078
01:23:46,969 --> 01:23:48,650
I hope not, my lord.

1079
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:49,631
Then you're safe.

1080
01:23:49,631 --> 01:23:51,511
I can't let more of our people die.

1081
01:24:11,303 --> 01:24:14,145
Thank you very much for the Game Developers Choice Award

1082
01:24:14,145 --> 01:24:15,586
for Game of the Year.

1083
01:24:15,586 --> 01:24:19,187
I am here with most of the core team that worked on Hades.

1084
01:24:19,187 --> 01:24:22,429
In 2012, we were really lucky to earn best debut

1085
01:24:22,429 --> 01:24:23,930
with our first game Bastion

1086
01:24:23,930 --> 01:24:25,771
at the Game Developers Choice Awards.

1087
01:24:25,771 --> 01:24:27,191
And all of us who worked on that game

1088
01:24:27,191 --> 01:24:28,612
are still working here together today.

1089
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:37,988
on all our projects and I don't think we ever thought we'd be back here again, much less in the company of last year's most beloved video games.

1090
01:24:37,988 --> 01:24:44,576
On behalf of our whole team and all the vital and new voices we've added who helped make Hades what it was,

1091
01:24:44,576 --> 01:24:49,182
we are just really grateful that people liked Hades so much.

1092
01:24:49,322 --> 01:24:52,363
It was a privilege to work on it and to make it at all.

1093
01:24:52,363 --> 01:24:57,284
We want to thank our audience for all our previous games, who encouraged us, and also

1094
01:24:57,284 --> 01:25:02,926
to the fans of Hades in our early access, who gave us feedback that was really, really

1095
01:25:02,926 --> 01:25:04,767
critical to helping finish Hades out.

1096
01:25:04,767 --> 01:25:10,269
Thank you to our partners and the platforms who helped Hades find an audience, and to

1097
01:25:10,269 --> 01:25:12,910
our families who love and support us.

1098
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:17,531
It feels really, really, really, really good to make them proud with a huge honor like

1099
01:25:17,531 --> 01:25:18,251
this one.

1100
01:25:18,251 --> 01:25:18,612
Thank you.

1101
01:25:19,293 --> 01:25:19,913
Thank you.

1102
01:25:19,913 --> 01:25:20,173
Thank you.

1103
01:25:20,173 --> 01:25:20,713
Thank you guys.

1104
01:25:20,713 --> 01:25:21,033
Thank you.

1105
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:21,973
Thank you.

1106
01:25:21,973 --> 01:25:22,393
Thank you.

1107
01:25:22,393 --> 01:25:28,454
Thanks for joining us everybody.

1108
01:25:28,454 --> 01:25:32,555
And a huge thanks to Katie, Blair, Leslie,

1109
01:25:32,555 --> 01:25:35,496
Jason, Sandesh, the jury, the crew,

1110
01:25:35,496 --> 01:25:38,356
and everyone who worked so hard on these awards.

1111
01:25:38,356 --> 01:25:39,936
So if you haven't clicked that X yet,

1112
01:25:39,936 --> 01:25:43,057
please hire me to write your game

1113
01:25:43,057 --> 01:25:45,497
because I am afraid that I'm going to be blacklisted

1114
01:25:45,497 --> 01:25:46,498
in the industry after this.

1115
01:25:46,498 --> 01:25:47,618
So, someone.

1116
01:25:49,070 --> 01:26:06,002
Please.

1117
01:26:06,002 --> 01:26:08,383
Okay, bye! âª
