1
00:00:05,955 --> 00:00:06,675
Well, hello, everybody.

2
00:00:08,297 --> 00:00:09,798
My name is Jason Kopolka.

3
00:00:10,258 --> 00:00:16,323
I'm the co-founder and chief creative officer

4
00:00:16,403 --> 00:00:17,264
of PopCap Games.

5
00:00:18,224 --> 00:00:19,806
And I've been invited here to talk

6
00:00:19,826 --> 00:00:22,108
about the post-mortem of Bejewelled.

7
00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:26,031
So I have to admit that I'm a little bit nervous about this

8
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:29,193
because I don't do a lot of presentations to begin with.

9
00:00:29,413 --> 00:00:32,636
But this one in particular was a little overwhelming

10
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:35,058
when I was asked about participating in it.

11
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,792
The first thing when I mentioned it to someone in a conversation went something like this, you know

12
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:45,154
I'm talking on the classic game post-mortems and they said, oh, yeah, what game I

13
00:00:45,214 --> 00:00:50,177
Said what what game do you think? I mean bejeweled and they're like, oh, oh, yeah. Oh, okay

14
00:00:50,297 --> 00:00:52,698
I guess maybe that is a classic game in some way

15
00:00:54,078 --> 00:00:58,521
but then I looked at the list of other games and stuff like maniac mansion and

16
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:04,183
out of this world and doom and then Pac-man of all things which although

17
00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:07,216
And that's the first thing that comes up when you Google Pac-Man.

18
00:01:07,296 --> 00:01:10,178
So, you know, you don't get that for Bejeweled.

19
00:01:10,498 --> 00:01:11,879
Well, actually, maybe you might, but...

20
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:15,882
So, you know, it's a little bit overwhelming.

21
00:01:16,382 --> 00:01:17,403
And then, of course, Will Wright.

22
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:21,165
So, the only thing that made me feel a little bit better is then they mentioned that,

23
00:01:22,126 --> 00:01:24,928
you know, this was my first reaction, of course, was they were not worthy,

24
00:01:25,008 --> 00:01:28,530
but it felt like Justin Bieber getting a Lifetime Achievement Award.

25
00:01:33,785 --> 00:01:36,666
Then someone pointed out that Marble Madness was also on the list.

26
00:01:37,786 --> 00:01:42,288
You know, no offense to Mark Kearney or anything, but I hate Marble Madness.

27
00:01:44,468 --> 00:01:48,110
In my arcade back at home, someone had poured a Coke onto the Marble Madness machine,

28
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,711
and so the trackball was always just a little bit sticky,

29
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:54,092
and so you just would fly off the edge all the time whenever you played it.

30
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:57,313
So I felt okay. I felt like we could be in the company of Marble Madness,

31
00:01:57,393 --> 00:02:00,294
because pretty soon they'd be letting in Gorf and stuff like that.

32
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:08,867
Anyway, so I decided that the best thing I could do is present the history of Bejeweled,

33
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:12,108
but tell people some things that maybe they don't actually know.

34
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:16,330
I have a feeling that there's actually going to be stuff in this that even people in our company don't know.

35
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:21,711
And I can 100% guarantee there's stuff in this that our PR guys don't want people to know.

36
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:30,234
So I can guarantee we'll include at least one never-before-secret and also one complete lie.

37
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:33,222
but I'm not going to tell you which is which.

38
00:02:35,303 --> 00:02:38,464
So we celebrated Bejeweled's 10th anniversary last year.

39
00:02:38,484 --> 00:02:40,504
It was just kind of a surprise.

40
00:02:40,544 --> 00:02:42,485
It took us a while before we even realized it and said,

41
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:43,465
oh, yeah, it's 10 years old.

42
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:43,885
Huh.

43
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:44,866
How about that?

44
00:02:45,146 --> 00:02:46,706
I didn't really, it went by so fast.

45
00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:49,187
The strange thing, when you thought about that,

46
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:52,208
is it's a once a short period of time and a very long one.

47
00:02:52,828 --> 00:02:55,249
And I keep hearing people who come up and say, oh, yeah,

48
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:56,390
I played Bejeweled in high school.

49
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,231
And if you're Miley Cyrus, I can believe that.

50
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,991
But you have people like this coming up and saying that they played Bejeweled in high school.

51
00:03:05,731 --> 00:03:07,332
And so, you know, this can't be possible.

52
00:03:07,352 --> 00:03:08,692
And you tell them, no, no, I don't think you did.

53
00:03:08,712 --> 00:03:09,492
And they're like, yeah, I did.

54
00:03:09,512 --> 00:03:11,193
I was like, no, no, you didn't.

55
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:19,334
But then I realized that for myself, certain games have kind of taken on a bit of an iconic status beyond their actual reality.

56
00:03:20,155 --> 00:03:22,655
For example, I'm quite sure I played World of Warcraft in high school.

57
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:28,326
You know, the Wikipedia says that couldn't have happened,

58
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:30,347
but it feels like that.

59
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:33,368
So in a sense, some games have become iconic enough

60
00:03:33,408 --> 00:03:36,289
that they become bigger than they really are.

61
00:03:36,589 --> 00:03:40,211
And for better or worse, I think Bejeweled has done that.

62
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:42,312
In 2001, when I told people I made Bejeweled,

63
00:03:42,592 --> 00:03:43,792
usually they'd say, so what?

64
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:44,773
What is that?

65
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:45,093
I don't know.

66
00:03:45,113 --> 00:03:47,374
In 2011, usually the response is different.

67
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:56,888
It's sort of as if you've, and you know, it's almost as if in some cases, it's like,

68
00:03:56,948 --> 00:03:57,888
oh yeah, what else did you invent?

69
00:03:57,908 --> 00:03:58,508
The paper clip?

70
00:03:59,109 --> 00:04:01,270
You know, it's, that's been around forever.

71
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:08,393
So yeah, so it, I don't know if it bejeweled as art, but it has sort of achieved this sort

72
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:13,355
of weird ubiquity in pop culture, which, you know, I can take some credit for it, but obviously

73
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:18,698
part of it is, you know, weird forces that, in the general zeitgeist that we don't have

74
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:19,458
that much control over.

75
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:25,103
Yeah, I'm not going to go over too much of the sort of stats on Bejeweled,

76
00:04:25,143 --> 00:04:28,346
because I'm assuming that most people who showed up here have some idea of what the game is,

77
00:04:28,566 --> 00:04:32,669
but these are a couple ones we have about the total units sold,

78
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:37,892
the 50 million supposedly, 500 million players, and 7 billion hours of play,

79
00:04:38,052 --> 00:04:40,154
which I'm told is 800,000 years.

80
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:42,876
So that's quite a lot.

81
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:48,880
Yeah, so, but it all started in a much more humble way, which was...

82
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:57,559
with me working at the Total Entertainment Network here in San Francisco back in 1995 and I started there as a

83
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:02,722
as a writer slash editor and I became later on a game producer and

84
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:08,866
Our job was to look for online games to bring to people that they could play on their 24-bit

85
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:10,307
K modem things

86
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:13,329
So these are a couple shots of me from earlier days

87
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:14,370
Yeah

88
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:19,213
Okay, I'll go over. I'm just gonna skip past that

89
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:25,374
This is one of the other co-founders, John Vici, who we met...

90
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:30,376
Well, I'd initially met him and the other co-founder of PopCap around 1997

91
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:33,798
when they'd invented an online game called ARK.

92
00:05:34,558 --> 00:05:39,641
And it was my job to wine and dine them and then to produce their game and to get it up onto 10.

93
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:43,803
It was a bit of a surprise because at that time they were about 18.

94
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:49,365
And so all my usual ploys, which were to take people to bars, were not feasible.

95
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:52,811
There's another shot of John back in 2000.

96
00:05:53,111 --> 00:05:58,215
So, and here's John and Brian.

97
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:02,839
We didn't have too many other shots of Brian that I was comfortable to show,

98
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,400
but that's a pretty good one.

99
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:07,483
And this was their game Attack Retrieved Arc,

100
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:11,165
which was, yeah, it was kind of like Counter-Strike in 1997,

101
00:06:11,406 --> 00:06:13,727
but with little saucers instead of terrorists.

102
00:06:14,448 --> 00:06:18,131
It was a pretty fun kind of, you know, team-based shooter.

103
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:21,246
at a time when that was not really being done very much.

104
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:23,527
So yeah, I thought they were really clever.

105
00:06:23,587 --> 00:06:25,128
They'd had a lot of really good ideas about games.

106
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:27,149
So we kept in touch over the next couple of years.

107
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:28,209
While I was working at 10,

108
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:31,611
they went on to go to work at OneNet for Sierra.

109
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:34,492
And in around 2000, we all decided

110
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:37,713
that we were sick of our jobs, we could do it better.

111
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:41,375
And so we quit and started a company out of our apartments.

112
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:43,576
This is mine.

113
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,517
John's was a lot messier.

114
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:51,679
And so yeah, we quit our jobs and started a brand new company.

115
00:06:52,899 --> 00:06:55,599
And that company was called Sexy Action Cool.

116
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,940
There's a long story about where that name came from.

117
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:09,762
But basically, it comes down to the fact that there was a movie poster for Antonio Manderas' film Desperado back in a basement suite I lived in.

118
00:07:10,522 --> 00:07:12,923
And the tagline at the top said, Sexy Action Cool.

119
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:15,203
And that became a weird inside joke.

120
00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:16,963
And the other...

121
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,743
big aspect was that the URL was free, obviously. So, the other thing that most people don't

122
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:28,785
know about PopCap's original years was that our first game was not Bejeweled, but Foxy

123
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:39,210
Poker, which you can see there. This was our ill-fated foray into pornography, where the

124
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:43,832
theory was we would make a strip poker game and then sell that engine to porn companies

125
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:46,593
and use that money to fund our awesome game ideas.

126
00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:49,527
So we did actually make it and release it.

127
00:07:50,247 --> 00:07:52,008
I think I actually have it here, so just one second.

128
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:55,549
It's safe for work, don't worry.

129
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,153
There we go.

130
00:08:05,214 --> 00:08:07,935
So it was basically video poker with a cartoon character

131
00:08:07,995 --> 00:08:10,856
who would strip after you got enough money.

132
00:08:11,837 --> 00:08:14,598
So it was not bad, actually, as video poker went.

133
00:08:15,236 --> 00:08:18,158
We couldn't actually bring ourselves to do any pornography though, so

134
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:23,402
the character there never actually becomes fully nude. She ends up in a state

135
00:08:24,162 --> 00:08:27,725
sort of like an Austin Power movie where there's always a bunch of objects sort of obscuring

136
00:08:28,286 --> 00:08:29,667
anything that might be naughty.

137
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:33,830
So this was good in terms of not getting us in trouble with the authorities,

138
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,652
but it disappointed a lot of the players of the game,

139
00:08:37,773 --> 00:08:40,975
who would spend quite a while. You'd have to spend multiple hours

140
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,258
and then at the end, the payoff was not...

141
00:08:44,685 --> 00:08:45,946
what they really were hoping for.

142
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:48,747
So yeah, so we did this initially.

143
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:55,072
And it had a little bit of popularity on the websites

144
00:08:55,092 --> 00:08:56,773
we were hosting it on.

145
00:08:57,133 --> 00:09:01,175
But eventually, what we found was that, oh,

146
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:02,636
there you can see at a later stage.

147
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:07,019
What we actually learned was that if you're

148
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,341
going to be sleazy, you really.

149
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,281
You really want to do it all the way.

150
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,522
And so if you're going to do a strip poker game,

151
00:09:17,002 --> 00:09:18,303
you should probably have some nudity in it.

152
00:09:19,904 --> 00:09:23,285
And the people we were dealing with in that industry

153
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:27,447
also didn't really feel like the kinds of people

154
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,948
we wanted to spend the rest of our lives doing business with.

155
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:32,530
So we decided that maybe we should

156
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,711
get into a different industry, something like family games.

157
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:38,933
However, this was the next lesson

158
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,233
we learned is that when you incorporated

159
00:09:40,253 --> 00:09:41,654
what's called sexy action cool.

160
00:09:42,937 --> 00:09:44,758
you have a few things that will haunt you for a while.

161
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:54,001
So, for several years after this, we were using the PopCap name and logo on our website,

162
00:09:54,581 --> 00:10:00,043
but according to our banks and so forth, we were still Sexy Action Cool, doing business

163
00:10:00,123 --> 00:10:04,225
as PopCap Games, but still, that would be what people's cheques said for at least several

164
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:04,485
years.

165
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:10,987
And as a Canadian, I also had a work visa that said I worked for an Internet company

166
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:11,988
called Sexy Action Cool.

167
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:18,473
So I've had some troubles with the US border guards over the years, and they definitely...

168
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:22,214
I got a few extra questions, I think, at the border due to that.

169
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:25,915
So that's a lesson to be learned for people is think about that name.

170
00:10:27,356 --> 00:10:30,177
Yeah, so eventually we switched to PopCap, and here's a couple of early logos.

171
00:10:31,717 --> 00:10:34,178
Yeah, well, I did all these, by the way, if you're curious.

172
00:10:35,498 --> 00:10:36,619
I'm available for logo design.

173
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:42,700
And this was, I think, my first business card, which still has my original address here in San Francisco.

174
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:49,347
Pretty shortly after that, I moved up to Vancouver, and we started, you know, the office in Seattle and so on.

175
00:10:50,887 --> 00:10:56,050
Anyway, so after we decided to make that change in direction, we did our first game.

176
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:01,232
And the game idea was to do something that was a simple web-based game in Java.

177
00:11:01,872 --> 00:11:09,576
Mostly, our idea was that we would sell it back to some of the companies we'd worked for before, like Pogo.com or OneNet, you know,

178
00:11:09,596 --> 00:11:13,017
because we thought we could do it quicker and more efficiently than those organizations were doing it.

179
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,133
So, we made our first game and it was called Diamond Mine.

180
00:11:18,173 --> 00:11:21,095
This was the original name for Bejeweled, as some people might know.

181
00:11:22,676 --> 00:11:25,358
But before I get into the details of how that was made,

182
00:11:25,758 --> 00:11:28,540
I'm going to answer the question of who we ripped off Bejeweled from.

183
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:33,404
There's been a lot of speculation on this topic and I've followed it with great interest over the years.

184
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:39,027
Most recently, there were some people who thought that we ripped it off from an old Russian game called Shariki,

185
00:11:39,508 --> 00:11:43,430
which was like 1973 on some sort of like Russian mainframe computer, I guess.

186
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,901
I've never heard of it before now, but it's possible.

187
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,163
Tetris was a common one people brought up,

188
00:11:51,384 --> 00:11:53,925
although of course, you know, the game is nothing like Tetris whatsoever.

189
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:56,147
But then there's a game called Tetris Attack,

190
00:11:56,207 --> 00:12:00,770
which apparently does involve swapping of pieces only on a side-to-side basis.

191
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,512
Interesting. Again, not the game that we were familiar with at all.

192
00:12:05,653 --> 00:12:09,215
And most recently, at dinner two nights ago, when we mentioned that we did Bejeweled,

193
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,136
the waitress's first response was,

194
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:12,937
oh yeah, that was a ripoff of Columns, right?

195
00:12:13,996 --> 00:12:15,357
And I hadn't thought of that, but it kind of is.

196
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:21,602
Although Columns was, you just had a block of three pieces

197
00:12:22,062 --> 00:12:24,023
that fell down a la Tetris, and you could sort of shift

198
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:26,685
the position of the gems in there.

199
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:30,568
So yeah, I'm sure it had some influence on the whole genre,

200
00:12:30,588 --> 00:12:32,670
but it was not the game that we were conscious of

201
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,610
as an influence.

202
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:37,533
And of course, some academic writers have gone on

203
00:12:37,573 --> 00:12:40,055
to create entire family trees of all the match three games

204
00:12:40,095 --> 00:12:42,277
that influence Bejeweled and then were influenced from there.

205
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:44,938
which I found really fascinating because I hadn't heard of any of them.

206
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,762
I'm quite curious to check out Panel de Pon at some point, but it wasn't a conscious influence.

207
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:54,664
I can tell you who we actually ripped off Bejeweled from,

208
00:12:55,284 --> 00:12:57,986
and this was because John Vici one day came to us and said,

209
00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:00,367
well, what should we do? And he said, I found a cool game,

210
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:05,250
and he showed it to us, and it was called Colors Game,

211
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:08,372
and it was a terrible game. It was an awful game.

212
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,301
this is stupid, what are you talking about?

213
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:12,921
And he said, no, you gotta play it, it's kinda cool.

214
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:14,901
And so we played it for a little bit,

215
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:16,442
and we thought, well, no, it's not cool.

216
00:13:16,742 --> 00:13:17,722
But the mechanic is cool.

217
00:13:18,242 --> 00:13:21,002
And we said, well, I don't know.

218
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,143
The problem with Color's Game is that it's a phantom game.

219
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:26,663
We've not been able to relocate it at any time.

220
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:29,044
Even using things like the internet archives

221
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:32,204
and Wayback Machine, no one has actually ever found it.

222
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:34,525
So I figure this is as good a time as any.

223
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,845
If anybody here knows who made Color's Game,

224
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:38,005
we'd be quite curious to hear.

225
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:40,700
because it literally has no proof.

226
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,821
I could only reenact, I sort of designed this

227
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:44,222
as a reenactment of what it looks like.

228
00:13:45,383 --> 00:13:47,844
This is actually probably better than Color's Game looked.

229
00:13:49,845 --> 00:13:51,286
Color's Game was, it wasn't even in Java.

230
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:52,367
I think it was in JavaScript.

231
00:13:52,487 --> 00:13:55,088
So I think you had to refresh the page after every move.

232
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:58,350
So it didn't actually animate or have sound

233
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,111
or anything like that.

234
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,632
I don't even know if it had a score or an end condition.

235
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:05,574
But John thought the matching condition was kind of cool.

236
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:06,655
And so we thought.

237
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:07,706
Well, OK.

238
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:10,707
And Brian, who is our programmer and tech lead,

239
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:13,807
he went off and wrote a much better engine in Java

240
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:15,468
that had animation and stuff like that.

241
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:17,968
So yeah, we did add a few things to Color's Game.

242
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:22,089
So we feel that we've evolved the gameplay a little bit.

243
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,210
The big thing that I was focused on initially

244
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,531
was the playing pieces, because Color's Game

245
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:30,771
was a bunch of featureless squares of color.

246
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:34,532
And it was hard to play, even without animation and so on,

247
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:36,833
because the squares were difficult to tell apart.

248
00:14:37,355 --> 00:14:38,876
God knows if you're colorblind, it would have been much worse.

249
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:43,077
So I thought it would be a good idea to have different shapes, because you're looking at

250
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:44,657
basically a pattern recognition thing.

251
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,258
It would be easier to look at different shapes.

252
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:50,859
But I was also a big believer in themes, and so I wanted to make sure that it was something

253
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,999
that had a clear visual theme that made sense.

254
00:14:54,239 --> 00:14:58,700
And so I started thinking about what comes in groups of seven that has radically different

255
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,761
colors and shapes, but still hangs together as one family?

256
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:04,442
And the obvious answer was, of course, fruits.

257
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:10,976
That was wrong because the problem is most fruits, there's not actually...

258
00:15:12,056 --> 00:15:14,177
finding seven different colors of fruit is actually kind of hard

259
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:16,578
and finding seven different shapes of fruit is also hard.

260
00:15:17,138 --> 00:15:19,099
Fruits tend to be kind of roundish for the most part.

261
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,440
So instead of a whole bunch of squares, you had a whole bunch of circles.

262
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,422
So then my next thought was gems, which seems like a better idea,

263
00:15:27,682 --> 00:15:30,883
but just finding a bunch of actual gemstones on the internet

264
00:15:31,683 --> 00:15:34,544
yielded a bunch of things of not very interesting color and shape,

265
00:15:34,564 --> 00:15:35,505
so it also wasn't very good.

266
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:41,816
So what I ended up finding was that the best results came from just drawing circles, squares,

267
00:15:41,876 --> 00:15:43,997
triangles, and so forth, simple geometric shapes.

268
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:45,678
But those were really boring.

269
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:51,241
So I decided, what if I made those squares and triangles look a little bit like gems

270
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:52,542
by drawing some facets on them?

271
00:15:53,442 --> 00:15:55,924
And indeed, that was kind of what I did.

272
00:15:56,064 --> 00:16:00,926
So this was the first pass of gems for what became Bejeweled.

273
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,968
As you can see, there's a few kind of ones that hit the cutting room floor towards the bottom there.

274
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:09,874
But a lot of them are still the classic shapes that we use in all the games since then.

275
00:16:11,495 --> 00:16:13,816
And so this is the actual first iteration of Diamond Mine.

276
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:16,858
And I think I can actually play that too.

277
00:16:16,878 --> 00:16:18,618
One second.

278
00:16:18,638 --> 00:16:21,000
Maybe.

279
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,501
There we go.

280
00:16:23,521 --> 00:16:23,601
Okay.

281
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:31,065
Yeah, so, as you can see, this is...

282
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:32,825
Oh, is it going to work?

283
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:33,906
Yeah.

284
00:16:35,686 --> 00:16:39,048
So a lot of the rules were pretty much the same as they are now.

285
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:41,030
You swap three things and they disappear.

286
00:16:42,271 --> 00:16:46,033
The big thing that was added to later iterations were the power gems.

287
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:50,116
In this case, if you make rows of four or five gems in a row,

288
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:51,517
nothing very interesting happens.

289
00:16:52,218 --> 00:16:55,540
So, but obviously, match three was a good deal,

290
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,882
and swapping and gems falling, all that stuff,

291
00:16:57,922 --> 00:17:01,004
turned out to be kind of a pretty workable idea.

292
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:05,987
Here we go.

293
00:17:10,928 --> 00:17:11,128
Yeah.

294
00:17:11,728 --> 00:17:15,249
Now, the key thing in retrospect that we came up with for Bejeweled

295
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:19,671
that we didn't know at the time was the, not just the timer bar.

296
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:21,591
The first thing we did was we put a timer bar into the game

297
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:24,292
because we felt the original game, which was super crude,

298
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:27,533
you know, didn't have a timer and therefore wasn't a real game and so forth.

299
00:17:27,553 --> 00:17:28,653
So we put in a timer

300
00:17:30,194 --> 00:17:32,074
because we thought that's how you make into a real arcade game.

301
00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:35,777
And that did work, but at the last minute we decided,

302
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:38,479
all right, let's leave level one as a tutorial

303
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:40,581
without a timer so that people can get the hang of it

304
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:42,162
before they play the real game.

305
00:17:43,543 --> 00:17:46,085
As it turned out, most people didn't really understand

306
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:48,707
that there was another level besides level one

307
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:49,588
or that it was meaningful.

308
00:17:50,148 --> 00:17:52,390
And so they played that tutorial pretty much

309
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,031
for the entire time they played the game

310
00:17:54,111 --> 00:17:56,553
and that became the classic version of Bejeweled

311
00:17:56,713 --> 00:17:58,074
was this untimed mode.

312
00:17:58,855 --> 00:17:59,736
So that was a bit of a mistake,

313
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:01,697
but turned out to be a fortuitous one.

314
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:08,149
I think, again, with the benefit of hindsight, Bejeweled in its classic, untimed form is

315
00:18:08,189 --> 00:18:10,270
much more like Solitaire than it is like Tetris.

316
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:15,414
It's a game that you do have to pay attention and use your brain a little bit, but at the

317
00:18:15,454 --> 00:18:17,796
same time it ends at a fairly random point.

318
00:18:17,856 --> 00:18:22,299
You can't really control to any extent when you're going to run out of moves any more

319
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,902
than you can control the outcome of a typical Solitaire game once you follow very simple

320
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:27,162
rules.

321
00:18:28,003 --> 00:18:29,944
So, you know, and as a result...

322
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:34,289
it's not that surprising that Bejeweled and Solitaire appeal to a lot of the same kinds of people.

323
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:36,389
You know, what we've come to call casual gamers,

324
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,071
and which back in the day we called my mom.

325
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:46,113
So, since this is a post-mortem, I figured I'd better do the classic scenario

326
00:18:46,514 --> 00:18:52,096
in which we look over what went right and what went wrong in the process.

327
00:18:52,376 --> 00:18:53,456
I've got enough time to go over that.

328
00:18:54,877 --> 00:18:56,898
So, yeah, this was the first thing that went right,

329
00:18:57,698 --> 00:18:59,979
is we ignored all the expert advice that we got.

330
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,311
I'm not sure if this is going to be what everyone would want to do, but it sort of worked for

331
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:05,911
us in this case.

332
00:19:07,032 --> 00:19:12,575
We talked to some people that I won't name, and they said, you know, this isn't even really

333
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:12,915
a game.

334
00:19:13,336 --> 00:19:18,238
Again, what I just described about the solitaire thing, they did not see as a benefit.

335
00:19:18,278 --> 00:19:20,120
They saw that as a weakness.

336
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,643
The fact that the game ended because of luck rather than skill seemed to make it irrelevant.

337
00:19:26,468 --> 00:19:29,871
And of course, in retrospect now, I've spent a lot of time thinking about this,

338
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:33,074
and I can say, you know, games of luck are not really bad.

339
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:35,896
I mean, in fact, for the better part of human history,

340
00:19:35,956 --> 00:19:39,379
people have played games of luck quite a bit and continue to do so now.

341
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,123
The only area where games of chance are not commonly accepted is, in fact,

342
00:19:44,624 --> 00:19:47,286
basically, you know, this conference center.

343
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:53,231
Computer games have been designed as games of skill,

344
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:55,573
and I think a lot of that comes from the roots in the arcade.

345
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:58,485
where that's kind of how it was structured.

346
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:01,547
You put in another quarter, you had to play a bit more,

347
00:20:01,807 --> 00:20:02,567
you got a little bit better,

348
00:20:02,628 --> 00:20:04,209
so your time would last a little bit longer.

349
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:06,810
So they have that DNA of being skill games.

350
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:08,972
And I think that still continues to flavor

351
00:20:09,412 --> 00:20:11,373
what people think computer games should be like these days.

352
00:20:12,214 --> 00:20:15,095
So games of chance are considered something different.

353
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:16,096
They're something that maybe you find

354
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:17,297
in a slot machine in Las Vegas,

355
00:20:17,377 --> 00:20:18,398
but not something that you'd imagine

356
00:20:19,138 --> 00:20:20,999
in an actual video game.

357
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,520
So that was the first thing.

358
00:20:22,997 --> 00:20:24,697
But at the time, of course, we didn't think about it that way.

359
00:20:24,797 --> 00:20:27,198
We just sort of said, my mom liked it.

360
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:29,799
So, you know, that's OK.

361
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,842
The second thing that I think we did right was we were

362
00:20:35,882 --> 00:20:39,083
completely oblivious to any sort of reality in the market.

363
00:20:40,144 --> 00:20:43,325
We started the company in, I think, late 2000.

364
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:46,967
And some of you may recall that there were other things

365
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:49,568
happening in the internet space around that time.

366
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:52,369
There's a few more things here.

367
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,305
Now, again, luckily for us, we didn't really understand any of that.

368
00:20:56,986 --> 00:20:59,848
I was aware of the fact that most of my friends didn't have jobs anymore

369
00:21:00,688 --> 00:21:02,509
and were going, you know, back to the Midwest,

370
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:06,792
but we didn't really think that maybe this was not the best time to start a new dot-com business.

371
00:21:07,613 --> 00:21:12,076
So, again, another piece of what actually went right for us,

372
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:14,417
because if we'd been paying attention to this,

373
00:21:14,457 --> 00:21:17,459
we probably would have gone into some other kind of business,

374
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:19,180
and certainly not an Internet-based company.

375
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:22,262
The next thing that went right...

376
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:26,624
also doesn't necessarily seem like the most obvious one, which is that

377
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:30,065
we were quite unsuccessful with trying to sell the game

378
00:21:30,765 --> 00:21:33,765
in the way we thought we would. Our initial plan

379
00:21:35,005 --> 00:21:38,066
for Bejeweled was to, again, take it and sell it to

380
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:41,667
the companies we'd worked for and talked with and

381
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:44,927
get a flat payment, but those companies,

382
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:48,468
they won't name, said no. And instead,

383
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:51,528
one company, Microsoft, did agree to

384
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:52,688
lease the game.

385
00:21:53,193 --> 00:21:56,976
They said, we can't afford $30,000 for this Diamond Mine game,

386
00:21:57,056 --> 00:21:59,877
but we could lease it for $1,500 a month.

387
00:22:00,698 --> 00:22:02,159
And we said, well, OK.

388
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:05,460
And we did our calculations, and we thought, you know, there's three of us.

389
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:07,362
There's $500 a month.

390
00:22:08,262 --> 00:22:10,603
If we make another 20 games, we'll be doing great.

391
00:22:12,004 --> 00:22:16,487
So yeah, and then of course, in retrospect, if we'd sold the game for $30,000,

392
00:22:16,827 --> 00:22:17,867
things would be a little bit different now.

393
00:22:18,608 --> 00:22:21,970
So I suppose you can take that as, you know, in the long run, you say,

394
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:22,530
own your own IP.

395
00:22:23,227 --> 00:22:29,091
all that sort of thing. We didn't think of it that way at the time, but it turned out pretty well.

396
00:22:31,213 --> 00:22:37,278
But I guess the last thing I'd say that went right was a little bit more relevant to things

397
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:42,242
you can do now, which is we did make a game that we liked. There's a lot of games that are floating

398
00:22:42,262 --> 00:22:47,066
around in this space that were kind of advert games and so on. They were kind of just knocked

399
00:22:47,106 --> 00:22:51,189
out by people quickly with the idea of, you know, we'll put this thing out, we'll make some money,

400
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,550
we'll do what we really want to do.

401
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:55,058
And we'd already done that, of course, with Foxy Poker.

402
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:58,740
So we made a decision that, you know, we're not going to do that.

403
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,301
So if we're going to make a game, we're going to make a game that we take seriously,

404
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,982
that we're going to make that, you know, we ourselves like to play.

405
00:23:06,022 --> 00:23:09,683
And so if, and that's something that we've carried on since that day at PopCap,

406
00:23:10,183 --> 00:23:12,964
is that even if we're making games that are supposed to appeal to everybody,

407
00:23:13,064 --> 00:23:15,845
to the soccer moms and board secretaries and whatever else,

408
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:18,786
we don't want to make a game that we ourselves don't like.

409
00:23:19,146 --> 00:23:22,767
So we're always the first and most important audience for any of our games.

410
00:23:25,115 --> 00:23:30,898
So yeah, and that, as I said, we did use my mom to actually test out the games, but in

411
00:23:30,958 --> 00:23:33,959
the long run, we were actually making the games for ourselves, not for her.

412
00:23:34,239 --> 00:23:36,880
Am I still, okay.

413
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,701
What's that thing doing up there?

414
00:23:39,981 --> 00:23:40,141
Anyway.

415
00:23:42,102 --> 00:23:47,164
So yeah, eventually that kind of led to our core game design belief, which is that if

416
00:23:47,204 --> 00:23:51,325
you're a skilled craftsman, you can indeed make games that you don't enjoy and probably

417
00:23:51,345 --> 00:23:52,065
be successful doing it.

418
00:23:53,494 --> 00:23:54,795
But you'll never make a really great game,

419
00:23:55,616 --> 00:23:58,618
because you just won't have that sort of instinctive feeling

420
00:23:58,879 --> 00:23:59,599
for what you're doing.

421
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,621
And you will kind of suck.

422
00:24:04,604 --> 00:24:05,985
Now, as for what went wrong with Bejeweled,

423
00:24:06,465 --> 00:24:07,726
well, we do have a few things there.

424
00:24:08,927 --> 00:24:13,211
The first one is that I decided to name

425
00:24:13,231 --> 00:24:16,294
all the games I worked on after Canadian classic rock bands.

426
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:18,115
So.

427
00:24:20,022 --> 00:24:22,003
That led to some unusual names.

428
00:24:22,383 --> 00:24:24,085
And in this case, Diamond Mine was actually

429
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:26,607
named after the song by the Canadian rock band Blue Rodeo,

430
00:24:27,487 --> 00:24:28,468
which is a pretty good song, by the way.

431
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:33,232
Later on, I would name our next game, Big Money,

432
00:24:33,592 --> 00:24:35,513
after a song from the band Rush.

433
00:24:36,814 --> 00:24:38,616
So that was Rush at the time.

434
00:24:38,816 --> 00:24:40,737
So yeah, they're still a quite good band.

435
00:24:40,797 --> 00:24:45,021
But that turned out to be not the best name.

436
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:46,181
And so

437
00:24:47,016 --> 00:24:50,798
Some of you may not have heard of Diamond Mine before and are wondering when the game actually turned into Bejeweled.

438
00:24:51,818 --> 00:24:57,481
And the answer to that is Microsoft and Bedazzled.

439
00:24:58,301 --> 00:25:02,423
So when we licensed the game to Microsoft, they didn't like the name.

440
00:25:02,683 --> 00:25:03,764
They had some concerns about it.

441
00:25:04,064 --> 00:25:08,706
Their primary one was that they wanted to have a unique name for the game on their website that wasn't used elsewhere.

442
00:25:10,007 --> 00:25:13,468
And so they suggested a bunch of alternate names for the game that they wanted.

443
00:25:13,949 --> 00:25:14,989
And we hated all of them.

444
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:21,480
but I especially hated Bejeweled because it was exactly at the same time as the Brendan

445
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,382
Fraser movie Bedazzled was coming out. And I was sure it was like a really lame topical

446
00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:31,085
reference that was going to be totally dated and forgotten about in about two months after

447
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:36,607
the fact. So that was true, but of course it was the other way around as far as which

448
00:25:36,647 --> 00:25:42,429
became sort of a dated pop culture reference. So yes, hate. I really hated the name Bejeweled.

449
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,130
I hated it even more.

450
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,641
after we had an interview with Old Man Murray, which some people may remember as kind of

451
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:55,622
the precursor to Penny Arcade. It was a very bitter humor site back in the day, and I think

452
00:25:55,642 --> 00:25:58,723
the main writers have gone on to do a few little games like Portal or something like

453
00:25:58,743 --> 00:26:05,024
that. But yeah, they didn't interview with us and ask us about Bejeweled, except they

454
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:10,306
continually referred to it as BeJewed and kept asking us what we had against the Jews.

455
00:26:13,546 --> 00:26:13,987
And of course...

456
00:26:14,847 --> 00:26:20,191
Immediately after they did that, I couldn't help but think of that every single time I saw the word Bejeweled.

457
00:26:21,232 --> 00:26:27,998
So it took a few years before I was able to realize that, in fact, Bejeweled was a much better name than Diamond Mine.

458
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:38,167
Just like Tobey Hooper, you know, took years before he admitted that Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a better name for his movie than his original title, which was Headcheese.

459
00:26:39,008 --> 00:26:39,108
So.

460
00:26:40,645 --> 00:26:43,486
Yes, so eventually we did decide Bejeweled is just a better name,

461
00:26:43,826 --> 00:26:46,586
and we switched Diamond Mine to Bejeweled on all the different sites.

462
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:48,867
However, we had a price to pay for that.

463
00:26:49,447 --> 00:26:52,667
The price was that Microsoft had to agree to let us do that,

464
00:26:53,507 --> 00:26:59,729
and we ended up giving them the right to put any sponsored version of Bejeweled up on their site, basically forever.

465
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:06,650
So the next time you see a really horrible-looking Bejeweled ad regame, that's why.

466
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,110
So I think we hit the nadir with Tyson Chicken Bejeweled.

467
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:15,834
which had a lot of chicken pieces replacing the gems.

468
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:18,536
There's another couple other ones.

469
00:27:18,576 --> 00:27:20,297
I think there was a vodka bejeweled at one point.

470
00:27:20,978 --> 00:27:22,599
I think we nixed, which one?

471
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,882
We had a Purina dog food bejeweled at one point too.

472
00:27:28,123 --> 00:27:30,005
There was a pork board one as well,

473
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:31,646
which I actually kind of liked

474
00:27:31,706 --> 00:27:33,988
because I wanted them to actually rename the game Beporked,

475
00:27:34,608 --> 00:27:36,770
but they didn't do that.

476
00:27:39,214 --> 00:27:48,142
So, what else went wrong? The single screen UI, which now looks pretty bad. That was a

477
00:27:48,202 --> 00:27:52,925
holdover from the days at Pogo where you kind of had to fit all the UI onto one screen because

478
00:27:53,026 --> 00:27:57,029
the download size was so ridiculously small that you couldn't, you didn't want to add

479
00:27:57,049 --> 00:28:02,073
another 30K worth of graphics by having a title screen or a separate option screen or

480
00:28:02,093 --> 00:28:06,276
anything. So, you kind of crammed all your UI onto the side of your game.

481
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:15,305
You know, and it made sense at one time, but in retrospect, it ended up making for a pretty ugly user interface,

482
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:22,090
and one that was kind of confusing to people in terms of which skill level they were supposed to pick or any of that sort of thing.

483
00:28:24,171 --> 00:28:28,174
So yes, by the time we got to vJewel 2, we had realized that a little more minimal UI was better,

484
00:28:28,414 --> 00:28:30,315
and so we'd kind of gotten rid of a lot of the clutter.

485
00:28:33,761 --> 00:28:36,103
That leaves the other problem we had, which is multiple game difficulties.

486
00:28:36,263 --> 00:28:40,226
That turned out to be a bit of an advantage in that most people didn't really understand the other game difficulties

487
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:41,567
and stuck with that untimed version.

488
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:47,112
But we didn't really understand that at the time, and so most of the games we did after that for a while,

489
00:28:47,812 --> 00:28:50,714
we kind of put a lot of different modes and a lot of different difficulty levels in there.

490
00:28:51,115 --> 00:28:52,416
And so here's a screen from Big Money.

491
00:28:53,377 --> 00:28:56,219
And yeah, I'm kind of not sure what I was thinking when we did this,

492
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,902
because I have no idea what game I'm supposed to play here.

493
00:29:01,503 --> 00:29:02,143
This is generally...

494
00:29:02,793 --> 00:29:06,996
my big beef with difficulty levels is that if you come into a game that you've never

495
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:10,858
played before, how do you know what level you want to play it at? Is it easy? Is it

496
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:15,742
hard? Even games that are familiar genres like shooters often have radically different

497
00:29:15,762 --> 00:29:20,425
difficulty levels. And it's a super high pressure thing to make a decision at. At the beginning

498
00:29:20,445 --> 00:29:23,367
of the game, you may not be able to change the difficulty later on. It's like, I don't

499
00:29:23,407 --> 00:29:27,670
know. Is it easy? Is it hard? And sometimes just the terminology may make it hard to figure

500
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:30,531
it out. If you change the titles from easy, normal, hard...

501
00:29:31,218 --> 00:29:38,420
to, you know, a wuss, a loser, and okay guy, you know, then that changes how people feel

502
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,021
about which difficulty level to pick. Anyway, so, yes, that was another lesson learned and

503
00:29:43,061 --> 00:29:48,083
we kind of got rid of difficulty levels in future Bejeweled games just because they are

504
00:29:48,103 --> 00:29:54,305
bad. And the final thing that I think I would say

505
00:29:54,365 --> 00:29:56,345
went wrong with Bejeweled was that...

506
00:29:57,399 --> 00:29:59,921
I had a big fondness for themes in games.

507
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:02,662
There were a lot of games there that were very kind of basic

508
00:30:02,722 --> 00:30:04,823
and minimal as far as their UI went.

509
00:30:05,244 --> 00:30:06,785
I always thought that it would be a good idea

510
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,146
to have really colorful themes and characters

511
00:30:09,186 --> 00:30:09,806
in all these games.

512
00:30:10,687 --> 00:30:13,008
And so I tried my hardest to make sure that was the case

513
00:30:13,048 --> 00:30:14,589
for all of our titles, including Bejeweled.

514
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:19,092
So Diamond Mine originally had a bit of a mining theme.

515
00:30:19,472 --> 00:30:21,493
So when you lost, it would say cave in,

516
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:24,515
and theoretically the idea was that the cave you were in

517
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:25,475
collapsed and so forth.

518
00:30:27,004 --> 00:30:31,186
The best I can say for this attempt at a theme is that most people didn't even notice it,

519
00:30:31,847 --> 00:30:36,009
and it completely went away by the time we got to Bejewelled 2, which is good,

520
00:30:36,229 --> 00:30:41,632
because instead of sort of spacey, new-age backgrounds, we would have had a lot of caves, I guess.

521
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:47,334
But I was still a strong believer that the games needed a strong, coherent theme,

522
00:30:47,975 --> 00:30:51,116
and that led to some issues later on down the road. Sometimes it was good.

523
00:30:51,296 --> 00:30:55,398
I think Bookworm, for example, worked well, because it added, I think, a very fun...

524
00:30:56,059 --> 00:31:01,981
know, coherent theme to word games which are often a little bit abstract. In other cases,

525
00:31:02,021 --> 00:31:07,543
it didn't work so well where Pagle was originally going to be a Norse mythology-themed game

526
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:14,866
called Thunderball in which Thor led his pet goat on a journey to Asgard that somehow involved

527
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:22,028
a lot of pegs and bouncing balls and stuff. We have some, the goat was kind of cute though,

528
00:31:22,168 --> 00:31:23,429
so I'm kind of sad that we lost the goat.

529
00:31:24,942 --> 00:31:30,284
Yeah, ultimately for Pagle, at some point we basically said, you know, this is kind of stupid.

530
00:31:31,124 --> 00:31:32,765
Why don't we just have some lobsters and unicorns?

531
00:31:34,065 --> 00:31:37,287
And obviously that worked out a little bit better.

532
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,388
So that was Bejeweled.

533
00:31:40,688 --> 00:31:44,770
So I guess the question is, is what happened after we finished the game?

534
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,772
And well, what happened was we kind of forgot about it and moved on.

535
00:31:49,192 --> 00:31:51,613
It went up on Microsoft's Gaming Zone site.

536
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:52,393
We got paid $1,500 a month.

537
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:57,562
And we sort of moved on to a bunch of other games and didn't think about it too much until

538
00:31:58,142 --> 00:32:01,083
a couple months later where it started to have a lot of users.

539
00:32:01,603 --> 00:32:07,966
At that time, it had 20,000, 30,000 user peaks, which was more than any other game on the

540
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:10,226
gaming zone. And people were starting to say, huh, this

541
00:32:10,266 --> 00:32:12,247
is kind of unusual. What's going on with this game?

542
00:32:13,087 --> 00:32:15,028
So, you know, we started paying more attention to Bejeweled then.

543
00:32:15,048 --> 00:32:17,128
We went back and said, well, maybe we should do something more with it.

544
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:22,210
This was exacerbated by the fact that around this time, the advertising market was collapsing.

545
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:22,750
And

546
00:32:23,447 --> 00:32:30,613
Microsoft, whose site was entirely dependent on advertising, was starting to get a little bit antsy about where they're getting money from.

547
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:37,519
And so we're starting to kind of say, maybe that next game maybe won't pay you $1,500 a month for that, maybe $1,000, maybe.

548
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,302
So we're starting to think that we needed to reconsider our business model.

549
00:32:42,803 --> 00:32:44,825
And indeed, we did.

550
00:32:45,145 --> 00:32:50,530
We decided to do Bejeweled Deluxe, which was, I guess, it's hardly the first downloadable game.

551
00:32:51,267 --> 00:32:55,410
But it was definitely, I think, one of the first of the new breed of downloadable games

552
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:01,914
that helped to spark the casual genre. Largely the idea for this came from Howard

553
00:33:01,934 --> 00:33:07,418
Tomlinson, who was an English mobile programmer who did Palm Pilot games and done a lot of

554
00:33:07,438 --> 00:33:11,261
shareware back in the day. And so when we were doing the game, the deluxe

555
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:17,245
version, we were unsure of ourselves. Our thought was, why will people buy this game?

556
00:33:17,265 --> 00:33:18,286
They can play it online for free.

557
00:33:19,095 --> 00:33:19,955
And he said, they will.

558
00:33:20,276 --> 00:33:21,496
And he said, how much can we sell it for?

559
00:33:21,977 --> 00:33:23,378
And I think I said $2.99.

560
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,860
And John said $5.99.

561
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,820
And Howard said $19.99.

562
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,222
And then he said, what?

563
00:33:29,602 --> 00:33:31,724
He said, if you price it at $2.99, they'll think it's crap.

564
00:33:32,284 --> 00:33:34,446
If you price it at $19.99, they'll be sure it's good.

565
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:39,850
So that turned out to be the right answer as it went on.

566
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:43,873
So yeah, so Bejeweled Deluxe we did as a downloadable game.

567
00:33:44,994 --> 00:33:46,595
As an anecdote about the development of it.

568
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:51,052
It was also the first introduction of the Bejeweled guy who has the voice that says

569
00:33:51,152 --> 00:33:55,655
excellent and so forth. In Bejeweled 1, that was me with a lot of

570
00:33:55,895 --> 00:33:59,178
heavy processing, but it wasn't me for any of the other games.

571
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:05,023
So I'm just clearing that up. It was voice actors with a lot of processing

572
00:34:05,163 --> 00:34:07,885
for Bejeweled 2, 3, Twist, et cetera, et cetera.

573
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:13,109
The development time for the first Java Bejeweled was, I don't even know, it was less than a

574
00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:14,170
month. It wasn't very long.

575
00:34:14,771 --> 00:34:16,632
John, do you remember? It was about a month.

576
00:34:17,617 --> 00:34:20,258
Bejeweled Deluxe was around three months, I think, approximately.

577
00:34:20,498 --> 00:34:23,040
So we thought that was a lot of time back then.

578
00:34:24,321 --> 00:34:27,062
As it turned out, you know, it got a little longer later on.

579
00:34:28,003 --> 00:34:29,024
Here's a nice little photo.

580
00:34:29,464 --> 00:34:31,845
The first Bejeweled Deluxe was actually 1.4 megabytes,

581
00:34:32,045 --> 00:34:35,587
which meant it was probably the last game that could be distributed on floppy disks.

582
00:34:36,388 --> 00:34:41,331
So these were some of the disks that we had made up as sort of promotional items to give to people at conferences.

583
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:46,694
And I think one of those was we gave that to, I think, Robert Coffey at Computer Gaming World.

584
00:34:47,367 --> 00:34:51,147
And he kind of laughed and then went back and they ended up writing about it

585
00:34:51,187 --> 00:34:52,868
and giving it some sort of award that they made up.

586
00:34:53,268 --> 00:34:54,048
So that was kind of cool.

587
00:34:56,009 --> 00:34:59,829
The other story that I have to tell about the early days of Bejeweled Deluxe is the Kaching story,

588
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,590
which some people may have heard.

589
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:07,711
When we first started selling the downloadable game, Brian, our programmer, went and wrote a program

590
00:35:07,891 --> 00:35:11,532
so that every time someone actually, you know, purchased it, it would play a sound effect

591
00:35:11,792 --> 00:35:15,193
on one of our computers that would, you know, a cash register sound of a Kaching.

592
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,472
And so he put it there.

593
00:35:17,572 --> 00:35:20,753
And then the story that John has is he was talking to his aunt,

594
00:35:20,893 --> 00:35:22,953
your mom, I don't know, someone.

595
00:35:23,433 --> 00:35:25,934
And they're telling him, it's like, John,

596
00:35:25,954 --> 00:35:27,334
you can't make any money sitting on the couch.

597
00:35:28,015 --> 00:35:30,275
And from the other room came this ka-ching, ka-ching.

598
00:35:31,535 --> 00:35:33,956
And he said, yes, I can.

599
00:35:35,136 --> 00:35:38,257
So anyway, yeah, the ka-chings started

600
00:35:38,297 --> 00:35:39,938
coming fairly fast and furious.

601
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:43,058
And so we were pretty sure that that downloadable model

602
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:44,019
was going to work.

603
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:45,219
We weren't totally sure why.

604
00:35:46,032 --> 00:35:46,892
It was doing all right.

605
00:35:48,374 --> 00:35:50,235
So moving down the Bejeweled franchise line,

606
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:52,958
we had Bejeweled 2, which came out, I think, in 2004.

607
00:35:53,738 --> 00:35:57,362
So yeah, that obviously allowed us the opportunity

608
00:35:57,382 --> 00:35:59,704
to fix a lot of the problems with the first Bejeweled,

609
00:35:59,764 --> 00:36:03,427
like the UI and so forth and graphics that I didn't draw.

610
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:06,830
And also add some of the things like Power Gems, which

611
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:08,331
were a pretty big addition.

612
00:36:09,472 --> 00:36:12,095
We had a lot of other things that we tried for Bejeweled 2.

613
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,962
kind of negative pieces. We had bombs and spiky things and boulders that you couldn't

614
00:36:16,982 --> 00:36:21,645
match. And the important lesson we learned from those was that they didn't make the game

615
00:36:21,685 --> 00:36:26,888
any more fun. They made it more complex, but nobody really liked them. So we decided that

616
00:36:26,928 --> 00:36:32,911
we wanted to avoid the fate of some titles like Tetris that create these variants that

617
00:36:32,951 --> 00:36:36,994
are different, but not actually better than the original. And so that's kind of been the

618
00:36:37,014 --> 00:36:40,156
bar we've tried to set for Bejeweled over the years, is that if we're going to add stuff

619
00:36:40,196 --> 00:36:41,937
to it, to make sure it's stuff that

620
00:36:42,394 --> 00:36:46,676
that is universally improving the game that nobody ever wants to take out.

621
00:36:47,276 --> 00:36:49,077
If people had said after playing Bejeweled 2,

622
00:36:49,497 --> 00:36:51,018
you know, can I play it in classic mode?

623
00:36:51,038 --> 00:36:54,639
I'd like to play it in Bejeweled 1 mode, I would have felt that that was a big failure.

624
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,561
I think there was one single person who did say that and said,

625
00:36:58,581 --> 00:36:59,882
you know, I like the rules better in Bejeweled 1.

626
00:36:59,982 --> 00:37:04,283
But there's only one guy and he was kind of stupid, so.

627
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:10,488
And anyway, the development time for Bejeweled 2, of course, was getting a little longer.

628
00:37:11,008 --> 00:37:15,289
And I think that was just about two years, which we felt was outrageously long at the time.

629
00:37:15,909 --> 00:37:19,390
Little did we know that later on that wouldn't seem so bad.

630
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:26,271
Yeah, speaking of, later on we did Bejeweled Twist, which came out in 2007, I think.

631
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:29,612
And that game was a learning experience for us in a couple of ways.

632
00:37:30,032 --> 00:37:31,833
That took at least three years to do.

633
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:35,933
And the lesson learned there is longer is not always better.

634
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:39,631
And we tried some stuff with Bejeweled Twist that,

635
00:37:40,611 --> 00:37:41,451
I wouldn't say it's a failure,

636
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:43,832
but it definitely turned out to be mechanics

637
00:37:43,992 --> 00:37:47,733
that a lot of Bejeweled players did not particularly like.

638
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,493
As a game by itself, I think it's a good one.

639
00:37:51,153 --> 00:37:53,834
As a Bejeweled game, it doesn't quite feel right.

640
00:37:54,434 --> 00:37:55,535
And so it's done all right,

641
00:37:55,755 --> 00:37:57,895
but it feels like it's a little bit out of step

642
00:37:58,595 --> 00:38:01,456
with what people are expecting from Bejeweled games.

643
00:38:03,517 --> 00:38:04,277
Yes, three years.

644
00:38:04,777 --> 00:38:05,757
A long three years.

645
00:38:08,464 --> 00:38:13,566
Then somewhere around that time we did our first, well we had mobile versions of Bejeweled over the years,

646
00:38:13,586 --> 00:38:17,748
but most of them had been done by external parties like Electronic Arts or so on.

647
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:21,289
So we did our first version of Bejeweled for the iPhone around 2008.

648
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,310
And that turned out to work really well.

649
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:27,511
We kind of knew that Bejeweled would work well on the iPhone

650
00:38:27,531 --> 00:38:29,892
because we'd had versions for Palm Pilots years ago.

651
00:38:30,693 --> 00:38:32,833
And so we kind of knew that touch mechanic was pretty good.

652
00:38:34,615 --> 00:38:38,138
We felt that it would be a good match for the iPhone, and it's turned out to do very well.

653
00:38:39,218 --> 00:38:45,303
The really interesting thing we had about the development of Bejeweled for the iPhone was the fact that your finger is not a stylus.

654
00:38:45,983 --> 00:38:49,886
And, in fact, people's fingers are comparatively big and clumsy.

655
00:38:50,827 --> 00:38:58,012
And this is a problem that plagues a lot of iPhone games, is that they try to port games that require a lot more precision than people's fingers are capable of.

656
00:38:58,893 --> 00:39:01,895
And there's a lot of stuff that goes on on successful iPhone apps where they kind of...

657
00:39:02,277 --> 00:39:04,419
minimize or get around that problem.

658
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:07,320
For typing, for example, there's an awful lot

659
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,301
of predictive stuff that Apple does to try and make sure

660
00:39:09,341 --> 00:39:12,023
that you press the right letter.

661
00:39:12,763 --> 00:39:14,044
And so for Bejeweled on the iPhone,

662
00:39:14,064 --> 00:39:15,005
we ended up with an equivalent,

663
00:39:15,245 --> 00:39:16,826
which we called fat finger detection,

664
00:39:17,886 --> 00:39:21,168
which meant that if you play Bejeweled on the iPhone

665
00:39:21,348 --> 00:39:22,889
and you try and make a swiping motion

666
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,651
to swap a gem in an area,

667
00:39:26,792 --> 00:39:30,614
even if you kind of miss the actual match,

668
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:32,775
we'll look at that area and say, okay,

669
00:39:32,795 --> 00:39:34,996
you know, there's a match in the upper right quadrant.

670
00:39:35,216 --> 00:39:37,417
You swiped an area that doesn't actually have a match,

671
00:39:37,717 --> 00:39:39,477
but we think you probably meant to do this.

672
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:42,318
And then we'll actually do the swap

673
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,238
that we think you meant to do.

674
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:44,999
You have to be pretty careful with that

675
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:47,239
because if you're too generous with it,

676
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,060
you know, you'll tap something in the bottom left

677
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,680
and then a match happens in the top right

678
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,621
and the game feels like it's playing itself.

679
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:55,322
But most of the time, people don't notice it

680
00:39:55,562 --> 00:39:57,082
because they go, oh yeah, of course I meant to do that.

681
00:39:57,975 --> 00:40:00,717
So that's one of those little things that actually makes a huge difference.

682
00:40:00,777 --> 00:40:03,838
And most people don't notice it unless you turn it off or take it out,

683
00:40:04,158 --> 00:40:07,840
at which point the game just suddenly starts feeling kind of clumsy and awkward.

684
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,061
What am I doing for time? Okay.

685
00:40:11,901 --> 00:40:14,442
So yeah, so here's a few stats on Bejeweled iPhone.

686
00:40:15,463 --> 00:40:16,643
It's, yes, sold a bunch.

687
00:40:17,424 --> 00:40:19,625
And later on, when we get to Bejeweled Blitz,

688
00:40:19,645 --> 00:40:22,766
you'll see that we have an interesting crossover with that.

689
00:40:22,786 --> 00:40:26,988
A lot of people play Bejeweled Blitz on their iPhone as well as on Facebook.

690
00:40:27,712 --> 00:40:34,496
So we felt that it's kind of unique in being one of the very few games that does have this ability to cross over from one platform to another.

691
00:40:35,796 --> 00:40:42,499
So yeah, we, something like, yeah, something like half, more than half of the people who play Bejeweled Blitz on their iPhone also play it on Facebook.

692
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:49,863
And that leads us to Bejeweled Blitz, which came out I think in, I think I said 2009, but it might have been late 2008.

693
00:40:49,903 --> 00:40:57,027
Yeah, now Bejeweled Blitz was a bit of a reaction to what had happened on Bejeweled Twist.

694
00:40:57,682 --> 00:41:01,164
in that I didn't want to do another three-year bejeweled title.

695
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,906
So I wanted to do something fast.

696
00:41:04,707 --> 00:41:06,808
And at the same time, our business guy, Dennis,

697
00:41:07,268 --> 00:41:09,730
kept coming up to me and saying, you know those Facebook games?

698
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:10,450
I hear they're pretty big.

699
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,031
I hear Facebook games are going to be big.

700
00:41:12,711 --> 00:41:16,234
And initially, we just kept blowing him off and saying, yeah, yeah,

701
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:17,474
that's like zombies biting ninjas.

702
00:41:17,514 --> 00:41:18,155
That's all stupid.

703
00:41:20,196 --> 00:41:21,977
But eventually, I was thinking, OK, maybe he's right.

704
00:41:21,997 --> 00:41:22,637
Maybe there's something there.

705
00:41:23,238 --> 00:41:24,719
We should perhaps try and do something.

706
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:26,180
We were hindered by a couple things.

707
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,380
One of them was the fact that.

708
00:41:28,371 --> 00:41:30,632
We didn't have a single Flash programmer in the entire company.

709
00:41:31,853 --> 00:41:34,915
So, that required a bit of creative thought.

710
00:41:35,835 --> 00:41:38,276
And what we ended up with was,

711
00:41:38,576 --> 00:41:42,318
we had one outsourced version of Bejeweled 2 in Flash

712
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:43,999
that didn't really work, so we never released it.

713
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:47,941
And we had one customer support guy, Jason Payne,

714
00:41:48,061 --> 00:41:49,822
who had decided to learn Flash in his spare time.

715
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:52,864
And so I said, well, okay, that's good enough.

716
00:41:53,184 --> 00:41:55,885
We'll get those two guys together and we'll...

717
00:41:56,404 --> 00:41:58,205
try and do something kind of quick and dirty for Facebook.

718
00:41:59,026 --> 00:42:02,928
So yeah, it took about three months to get that done.

719
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:05,289
But it was pretty rough around the edges,

720
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:07,690
but you kind of get the idea across.

721
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:10,792
Later on, of course, we needed to recruit a little more

722
00:42:10,832 --> 00:42:16,756
heavily to fill up the necessary vacancies that we had.

723
00:42:17,456 --> 00:42:18,737
But that turned out.

724
00:42:20,438 --> 00:42:22,739
So we don't have that problem anymore.

725
00:42:22,899 --> 00:42:23,279
It's OK.

726
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:23,820
It's OK.

727
00:42:26,242 --> 00:42:30,766
So yeah, so Bejeweled Blitz came out and there's some more stats here.

728
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:33,949
It's done quite well.

729
00:42:34,389 --> 00:42:39,613
And although we developed it quickly, that was a refreshing change from three-year development cycles.

730
00:42:40,194 --> 00:42:46,279
But what we're now discovering, of course, is that with social games, the development cycle never actually ends.

731
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:53,685
So people who were on Bejeweled Blitz, you know, two years ago can still be on Bejeweled Blitz because it's, you know, it's a service.

732
00:42:54,025 --> 00:42:54,326
It's not a...

733
00:42:55,835 --> 00:42:59,358
fire and forget product that you just release and forget about.

734
00:42:59,378 --> 00:43:01,359
It's something we had to keep adding to and evolving.

735
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,962
And so that's been a different kind of development for us as well.

736
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:09,246
So trying to transform Bejeweled from the kind of game it was in 2000

737
00:43:09,306 --> 00:43:13,850
to the kind of game it has to be to be relevant in 2011

738
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,812
has been a bit of a real learning curve for us.

739
00:43:18,433 --> 00:43:20,395
And those are a bunch of stats. I don't know. There's a lot of stuff there.

740
00:43:20,775 --> 00:43:21,336
A lot of gems.

741
00:43:21,356 --> 00:43:24,678
I want some more gem stats. Yeah.

742
00:43:28,714 --> 00:43:30,835
Then Bejeweled 3. Bejeweled 3 came out in 2010.

743
00:43:30,995 --> 00:43:36,118
That was kind of a parallel development with things like Bejeweled Blitz.

744
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:44,262
And it was kind of in some ways, maybe not the last gasp, but certainly one of the holdovers

745
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:47,603
from our older way of doing games where you had a fairly long development cycle

746
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:53,846
and you had a single product rather than an ongoing service or, you know, set of products.

747
00:43:54,712 --> 00:43:56,533
So that took about two years.

748
00:43:56,753 --> 00:44:01,456
So we got better, but it's still a little long,

749
00:44:01,876 --> 00:44:03,878
given the kind of world we're seeing now.

750
00:44:04,998 --> 00:44:06,639
But yeah, but we're pretty happy with Bejeweled 3.

751
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,901
We did feel like we didn't alter the mechanics dramatically,

752
00:44:10,062 --> 00:44:12,463
but we felt that we got back to the core

753
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,724
of what people liked about Bejeweled

754
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,646
that maybe we had drifted away from with Bejeweled Twist.

755
00:44:19,187 --> 00:44:20,788
And then finally, just I think a week or two ago,

756
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:23,670
we released Bejeweled Blitz Live for Xbox Live.

757
00:44:24,364 --> 00:44:29,047
which was again kind of an experiment bringing the Blitz mechanics to Xbox,

758
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,750
where you don't have the Facebook social graph, but you have a different social graph,

759
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,091
which is your Xbox Live friends.

760
00:44:34,831 --> 00:44:37,873
So it's a little bit early for us to tell whether that's going to be successful,

761
00:44:37,973 --> 00:44:41,756
but it lends itself to a different kind of social interaction.

762
00:44:41,796 --> 00:44:46,319
People on Xbox Live don't really play asynchronously, they play synchronously.

763
00:44:46,479 --> 00:44:49,681
They get together and they play at the same time and the whole thing is set up

764
00:44:50,162 --> 00:44:53,404
so that people can play in the same room and talk to each other and all that.

765
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,602
where Facebook is set up for asynchronous play, where you sort of play and other people

766
00:44:58,622 --> 00:45:04,865
play whenever it's convenient. What's next for Bejeweled? I guess I have a few more minutes.

767
00:45:05,366 --> 00:45:10,128
I'll try and finish up here and then leave a bit of time for questions. Well, I'm not

768
00:45:10,148 --> 00:45:17,452
sure exactly what I can say that's not secret, but I can promise you this. There's a popular

769
00:45:17,492 --> 00:45:23,175
game played at the PopCap offices called Bejeweled Blitz Carnage, which is a drinking game that

770
00:45:24,071 --> 00:45:29,094
anyone who goes to the local tavern, the two bells, is likely to spot happening. So you

771
00:45:29,114 --> 00:45:34,018
can see all us sitting there with iPhones playing Bejeweled Blitz, and I'm replicating

772
00:45:34,058 --> 00:45:38,361
here for the benefit of anyone at GDC who might have an iPhone and Bejeweled, the rules,

773
00:45:38,601 --> 00:45:43,844
the official drinking game rules for Bejeweled Blitz carnage. So everyone starts playing

774
00:45:44,204 --> 00:45:49,648
a game of Bejeweled Blitz on their iPhone at the same time, and at the end,

775
00:45:50,669 --> 00:45:54,251
whoever has the lowest score, you know, subtracts that from the person with the highest score

776
00:45:54,812 --> 00:45:59,635
and has to take a drink for every 10,000 point difference. So, there, I think the record

777
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:03,677
I've seen is there was a case where the high score was 400,000 and the low score was about

778
00:46:04,078 --> 00:46:11,523
10,000. So, that can add up to a lot and in some cases, that also means that the loser

779
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:13,844
will drop out of the game fairly quickly thereafter.

780
00:46:15,202 --> 00:46:30,566
So now that may seem like a joke, but it actually did lead to some interesting thoughts for the future of Bejeweled in that I don't know about the drinking part necessarily for everybody, but it was interesting to be able to play that game in a group experience somewhere outside of your computer room at home.

781
00:46:30,826 --> 00:46:38,208
So being able to do that in a bar or in a restaurant starts leading to a lot of interesting ideas for things like geolocation and so on.

782
00:46:38,588 --> 00:46:41,549
So I think we might start seeing things like that.

783
00:46:41,889 --> 00:46:44,830
I think that no one has quite nailed geolocation games yet.

784
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:49,191
but I have a feeling that it might be interesting to experiment with Bejeweled.

785
00:46:51,692 --> 00:46:54,953
And yes, now that I have a few seconds left, I will give away a secret.

786
00:46:56,214 --> 00:46:58,455
Bejeweled Blitz players may be familiar with the cat's eye gem

787
00:46:59,335 --> 00:47:01,216
that causes a cat head to fly out of

788
00:47:01,656 --> 00:47:03,637
the screen and shoot lasers to blow stuff up.

789
00:47:04,577 --> 00:47:08,118
So I'm going to reveal the actual identity of the laser cat.

790
00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:09,859
It's my cat.

791
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,281
Her name is Snackers and she has a secret cameo.

792
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:19,793
in every single Bejeweled game to date. So, that's a secret nobody knows.

793
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:26,556
Yeah, and so in closing, I guess the final thought I have about, you know, being allowed

794
00:47:26,596 --> 00:47:32,439
to come up here and speak about Bejeweled as a classic game is that I do feel it's quite

795
00:47:32,459 --> 00:47:37,301
an honor that our game is even considered a classic alongside a lot of the ones that

796
00:47:37,741 --> 00:47:42,583
are in this list. At 10 years old, it's certainly the, you know, the youngest of those games.

797
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:48,228
So I kind of hope that in maybe another 10 or 20 years, they'll invite us back to give

798
00:47:48,248 --> 00:47:50,989
another postmortem of the next 20 years of Bejewelled.

799
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:56,711
So the image that keeps coming to my head is at the end of Saving Private Ryan, where

800
00:47:57,492 --> 00:48:02,173
Matt Damon has been saved and everyone else is dead, and Tom Hanks, you know, whispers

801
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:07,115
in his ear, you know, earn this, and then Matt Damon has to go on to, you know, lead

802
00:48:07,155 --> 00:48:09,316
a good life to justify the sacrifice everyone made.

803
00:48:10,608 --> 00:48:15,091
Yes, I'm hoping we'll earn the honor of being considered a classic game with what we do

804
00:48:15,131 --> 00:48:15,972
with Bejeweled in the future.

805
00:48:16,712 --> 00:48:17,793
So that's it.

806
00:48:18,073 --> 00:48:18,233
Thanks.

807
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:30,301
So I'm told there's a couple of microphones back in the aisles here.

808
00:48:31,182 --> 00:48:34,444
So if people want to ask questions, I think we have a few minutes for that.

809
00:48:35,565 --> 00:48:36,145
I have a question.

810
00:48:36,986 --> 00:48:37,206
Okay.

811
00:48:38,207 --> 00:48:38,527
Who are you?

812
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:39,047
Oh, there you go.

813
00:48:39,267 --> 00:48:39,347
Hi.

814
00:48:40,388 --> 00:48:53,657
Hi. In the early versions of the game, how much of AI did you have to determine what gems would drop and make sure there were moves available for players, and how did that evolve over later editions?

815
00:48:55,298 --> 00:49:04,624
The question was, was there any AI in the early versions of the game that sort of selected which gems fell in to make sure you still had valid moves, and the answer is none.

816
00:49:05,304 --> 00:49:08,907
In the earlier versions of the game, there was no AI of any sort to do that.

817
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:14,114
ran out of moves, you ran out of moves. It would just say, if it was the standard game,

818
00:49:14,134 --> 00:49:17,856
it would just say, out of moves, and your game ended. If it was a timed game, it would

819
00:49:17,896 --> 00:49:21,758
say, no more moves, and all the gems would fall off, and you'd get a new board that would

820
00:49:21,778 --> 00:49:26,920
drop in. That was a little bit inelegant, and so in later versions, like Bejeweled 2

821
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:32,722
and later, there is AI that checks in the untimed version, you still run out of moves.

822
00:49:33,342 --> 00:49:36,944
In the timed version, we figure you've got enough of a problem with whatever clock is

823
00:49:36,964 --> 00:49:37,424
counting down.

824
00:49:39,957 --> 00:49:44,818
It makes sure that whenever new gems fall in, that there's at least one potential match available on the board after that.

825
00:49:46,799 --> 00:49:55,941
Some people believe that there's more sophisticated logic going on in terms of trying to set people up with certain kinds of moves or making it easier or harder, but there really isn't.

826
00:49:56,501 --> 00:49:57,341
It's pretty straightforward.

827
00:50:00,682 --> 00:50:01,262
Any other questions?

828
00:50:04,383 --> 00:50:04,543
Nope.

829
00:50:06,264 --> 00:50:07,464
Oh, wait, someone's moving up.

830
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:12,451
I had a question about the sequels.

831
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:17,632
Just with the first one, I mean, the basic concept of Bejeweled is relatively simple,

832
00:50:17,712 --> 00:50:19,012
so it didn't take very long.

833
00:50:19,533 --> 00:50:21,493
Why did the sequels take so much longer?

834
00:50:21,993 --> 00:50:23,974
You had two, three year development times?

835
00:50:25,514 --> 00:50:27,775
Well, the question was, why did all those sequels take so long?

836
00:50:29,215 --> 00:50:29,715
Good question.

837
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,816
Well, I mean, part of it became that we...

838
00:50:35,036 --> 00:50:38,717
As they became more complex, in terms of some of the subtle things about them...

839
00:50:39,425 --> 00:50:43,966
it became, it took a lot more time. Part of the thing that we try to do at PopCap is make

840
00:50:44,006 --> 00:50:51,147
sure that games are simple but fun. And as it turns out, sometimes simplicity takes longer

841
00:50:51,167 --> 00:50:55,308
than complexity. So some of those games you would have seen much more complex versions

842
00:50:55,348 --> 00:50:59,889
of them at one year in, and by the time two years rolled around, they're actually simpler.

843
00:51:00,609 --> 00:51:04,650
So the sad truth is that sometimes a lot of that time was spent doing things that didn't

844
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:07,610
work out or that got, you know, tried and then removed.

845
00:51:08,422 --> 00:51:10,723
So it's sad because it's not evident,

846
00:51:11,064 --> 00:51:13,905
so you don't get to see the stuff that got taken out.

847
00:51:14,425 --> 00:51:19,428
But at the end, we feel that striving for simplicity

848
00:51:19,528 --> 00:51:21,229
is kind of the direction we want to go in as a company,

849
00:51:21,289 --> 00:51:24,611
and so we're willing to spend a bit more time to reach that.

850
00:51:25,571 --> 00:51:25,891
Thank you.

851
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:26,391
Set up.

852
00:51:26,411 --> 00:51:29,873
I don't know, any more questions?

853
00:51:31,347 --> 00:51:32,628
Anyone else? Okay, you, yeah.

854
00:51:33,108 --> 00:51:35,471
Yeah, what did you guys think of Puzzle Quest?

855
00:51:35,711 --> 00:51:40,215
Was that a surprise to you guys or just a path you guys didn't want to go down?

856
00:51:40,295 --> 00:51:43,037
The question is, what do we think of Puzzle Quest? I love Puzzle Quest.

857
00:51:43,638 --> 00:51:46,220
I think that's a great game, yeah.

858
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,783
We sometimes have, you know, there's been some games that have come out that are,

859
00:51:49,263 --> 00:51:51,345
there's been a number of clones and stuff of Bejeweled.

860
00:51:52,326 --> 00:51:56,830
I'm not really fond of the ones that don't add anything or that are just...

861
00:51:57,849 --> 00:51:59,670
or that are worse than the original game.

862
00:52:00,010 --> 00:52:01,651
But a game like Puzzle Quest I thought was great

863
00:52:01,711 --> 00:52:04,212
because it added something that we honestly would never

864
00:52:04,232 --> 00:52:05,072
have come up with ourselves.

865
00:52:05,472 --> 00:52:07,513
So it really was super cool.

866
00:52:07,733 --> 00:52:09,854
So yeah, we're big fans.

867
00:52:11,235 --> 00:52:11,955
All right, this guy.

868
00:52:12,155 --> 00:52:14,956
Yeah, I've been playing Visual Twist quite a while,

869
00:52:14,976 --> 00:52:18,138
with a lot, and I wonder why it's not possible

870
00:52:18,198 --> 00:52:19,738
to move in both directions,

871
00:52:19,998 --> 00:52:21,339
to twist the gem in both directions.

872
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,180
The question.

873
00:52:25,993 --> 00:52:30,435
The question was, in Bejeweled Blitz, why are you not allowed, or rather, Bejeweled Twist,

874
00:52:30,956 --> 00:52:34,617
why are you not allowed to rotate the gems in the counterclockwise direction?

875
00:52:34,657 --> 00:52:36,378
Because it will make much more sense, I think.

876
00:52:37,178 --> 00:52:39,799
Well, and the answer is, you're fired.

877
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,722
That's the answer.

878
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:49,403
But John Veitch is going to give me a hundred bucks for this.

879
00:52:49,543 --> 00:52:50,064
Yeah.

880
00:52:51,564 --> 00:52:54,105
That was, actually, the back story on that was that...

881
00:52:54,693 --> 00:52:56,574
That was the first question everyone asked about Bejeweled Twist,

882
00:52:56,614 --> 00:52:58,594
is why you couldn't rotate the gems in both directions.

883
00:52:59,455 --> 00:53:01,595
And it was the first thing we actually tried,

884
00:53:01,995 --> 00:53:04,396
and it actually made the game much, much worse.

885
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:07,636
In that it created a much larger possibility space of moves,

886
00:53:07,777 --> 00:53:10,717
and most people would just stare paralyzed at the screen,

887
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,018
trying to figure out what to do next.

888
00:53:12,818 --> 00:53:15,418
But it didn't keep people from asking that question regularly,

889
00:53:15,738 --> 00:53:16,659
every week or so.

890
00:53:16,919 --> 00:53:20,499
And so I started threatening to fire anyone who ever asked that question again.

891
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,840
So, he's fired now.

892
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:23,180
Okay.

893
00:53:24,985 --> 00:53:29,306
Next. In terms of the casual audience, have you noticed your players becoming more sophisticated

894
00:53:29,346 --> 00:53:32,927
over the years and how sophisticated do you think the audience can take, like in terms

895
00:53:32,947 --> 00:53:37,388
of gameplay today? Um, there was a question there about have I noticed a difference between

896
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:43,909
the casual audience and the hardcore audience? No, just over the years, have you noticed

897
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:48,209
your player base kind of training up with taking more and more complex game types? Or

898
00:53:48,229 --> 00:53:52,810
do you think the audience, like from ten or five even, is kind of the same as today?

899
00:53:54,393 --> 00:53:58,736
The question was whether the audience for casual games has gotten more sophisticated over the years.

900
00:54:00,478 --> 00:54:02,719
That's an odd question. I'd say yes and no.

901
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:09,044
I would say that on the one hand, clearly they have, in that some of our games in the last couple of years,

902
00:54:09,084 --> 00:54:14,688
like Plants vs. Zombies in particular, are quite sophisticated by comparison to our earlier titles,

903
00:54:14,988 --> 00:54:19,311
and the audience seems to be okay with that.

904
00:54:20,312 --> 00:54:23,414
At the same time, I would say that in some ways, some of the audience has gotten less sophisticated.

905
00:54:23,923 --> 00:54:28,506
You've got people on iPhone and Facebook now who are, you know, very, very casual gamers,

906
00:54:28,546 --> 00:54:33,609
even by our standards, and they don't, for them, you know, they want games that are even

907
00:54:33,669 --> 00:54:37,592
simpler than the ones we were doing 10 years ago because they're, you know, they're either

908
00:54:37,632 --> 00:54:41,214
very unfamiliar with games or they're playing on a bus with one hand or something like that.

909
00:54:42,054 --> 00:54:45,036
And so, oddly, in those cases, we're actually thinking about games that have to be made

910
00:54:45,196 --> 00:54:45,717
even simpler.

911
00:54:45,857 --> 00:54:49,579
If you look at something like Angry Birds, you know, that's quite a simple game.

912
00:54:51,483 --> 00:54:55,025
you know, I think that's to its benefit. I don't think making that game more complex

913
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,967
would have made it more popular. So I say that we seem to be going in two directions.

914
00:54:58,987 --> 00:55:03,969
You've got a trend towards more sophisticated titles. At the same time, you have these brand

915
00:55:04,029 --> 00:55:08,992
new, relatively naive, you know, people who are starting to play games who have never

916
00:55:09,052 --> 00:55:14,314
played any sort of game before, and they are kind of looking for very simple games. So,

917
00:55:14,654 --> 00:55:16,675
yeah, I don't think it's a simple answer one way or the other.

918
00:55:20,194 --> 00:55:24,956
Considering your development time, how big were your teams and how much...

919
00:55:25,036 --> 00:55:26,417
what's the composition of the team?

920
00:55:26,797 --> 00:55:28,318
And also the second question says,

921
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,081
how much time did you guys spend on level designs or eventing?

922
00:55:34,542 --> 00:55:36,023
How much time do we spend on level designs?

923
00:55:37,163 --> 00:55:41,786
Also how big the team considering the long development time?

924
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:44,410
I'm not sure I got the question.

925
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:45,070
Was it for level design?

926
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:48,331
How big was your team when you developed the game?

927
00:55:48,491 --> 00:55:51,932
And also, how much time you spend doing the level design?

928
00:55:51,992 --> 00:55:53,212
Or was it randomized?

929
00:55:54,052 --> 00:55:56,953
Well, I can answer how much time we spend on level design, which

930
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:59,913
is very, very, very little, because there's not really

931
00:55:59,933 --> 00:56:01,894
a lot of levels in any of the Bejeweled games.

932
00:56:01,914 --> 00:56:06,095
We spent some time on puzzle design in some of the games

933
00:56:06,115 --> 00:56:06,595
like Bejeweled 2.

934
00:56:08,455 --> 00:56:10,075
In terms of the overall size of the teams,

935
00:56:10,735 --> 00:56:12,316
that hasn't changed too much over the years.

936
00:56:13,424 --> 00:56:15,085
obviously the first game was two or three people.

937
00:56:16,786 --> 00:56:20,367
And to be honest, most of the later games have been only slightly larger.

938
00:56:20,608 --> 00:56:23,429
They've been maybe four or five people,

939
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:27,711
and then occasionally a larger team might show up in the last stages of the

940
00:56:27,731 --> 00:56:31,633
game to do quality assurance and marketing and

941
00:56:31,673 --> 00:56:33,554
things like that. But the bulk of the games are still

942
00:56:33,574 --> 00:56:37,896
done by teams of less than six people. So they may take a long time, but in terms

943
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,937
of man years or whatever, they're still fairly small scale

944
00:56:41,878 --> 00:56:42,318
compared to

945
00:56:43,128 --> 00:56:45,571
you know, an Assassin's Creed or a typical console title.

946
00:56:47,533 --> 00:56:50,637
Alright, I think that's about it. I think I'm getting a

947
00:56:50,997 --> 00:56:54,381
peacing sign or something, I don't know. So yeah, if there's any more questions...

948
00:56:55,201 --> 00:56:57,364
Nope. Okay, well thank you.
