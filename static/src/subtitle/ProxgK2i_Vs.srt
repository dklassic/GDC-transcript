1
00:00:06,937 --> 00:00:09,178
Welcome to GDC 2018.

2
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:17,742
And welcome to the Mobile Games Summit.

3
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:19,603
And welcome to our first session,

4
00:00:19,663 --> 00:00:20,703
the year in mobile games.

5
00:00:22,044 --> 00:00:23,085
I'm Steve Marecki.

6
00:00:23,845 --> 00:00:25,866
In addition to presenter for this hour,

7
00:00:25,926 --> 00:00:28,387
I'm also one of the organizers of the Mobile Games Summit.

8
00:00:29,348 --> 00:00:31,729
And I have my two longtime co-presenters

9
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:33,530
of this session, Dave Rall.

10
00:00:42,687 --> 00:00:51,289
And Juan Grill, who, by the way, is also one of the organizers

11
00:00:51,429 --> 00:00:52,269
of the Mobile Game Summit.

12
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:57,230
So as usual, we'll be looking at a lot of the top topics

13
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,011
and trends in the past year in mobile gaming.

14
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:05,412
But first, we'll start with a few of the interesting stories

15
00:01:06,072 --> 00:01:09,053
that didn't quite make the cut for spending an entire section

16
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:09,673
of the talk on.

17
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:17,404
So for many years, the top social casino games have seemed like they're set in stone.

18
00:01:17,984 --> 00:01:23,447
No games leaving the top 25 list, no new games coming onto the top 25 list.

19
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:31,291
But this year, we saw two new entrants in the form of Cashman Casino and Huge Casino.

20
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,153
Explanation?

21
00:01:35,514 --> 00:01:39,256
Well, Huge Casino has taken a page from the playbook of Big Fish.

22
00:01:40,304 --> 00:01:43,406
and they've added social play with strangers to their slot offerings.

23
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:47,950
Just like in Big Fish Casino, you're joined in a slot room by several other players,

24
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,152
and you see whenever they have big wins.

25
00:01:51,993 --> 00:01:54,835
As for Cashman Casino, this app is from Product Madness,

26
00:01:55,336 --> 00:01:57,758
the company behind the successful Heart of Vegas.

27
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,220
Product Madness is owned by Aristocrat,

28
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,123
who's one of the largest manufacturers of land-based slots,

29
00:02:04,683 --> 00:02:07,345
including the number one machine of the last decade, Buffalo.

30
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,692
So it's not surprising that the marriage of aristocrats top-tier IP

31
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,015
and product madness' expertise in social casino

32
00:02:15,455 --> 00:02:16,656
leads to a winning product.

33
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:24,042
After a few years of being pushed down out of its natural birthright

34
00:02:24,422 --> 00:02:28,485
of the top slot by games like Clash of Clans or Game of War,

35
00:02:29,886 --> 00:02:32,869
Candy Crush Saga regained its top spot

36
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:37,252
in the grossing charts just in time for the fifth anniversary of its release.

37
00:02:41,025 --> 00:02:41,666
Happy birthday.

38
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:45,730
And speaking of Game of War, this Machine Zone game,

39
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,553
after unflinchingly occupying the top spot

40
00:02:49,754 --> 00:02:53,597
for the last several years, has plummeted.

41
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:57,821
This is last year's chart from the 2017 talk.

42
00:02:58,282 --> 00:03:00,384
Today, it's almost vanished from sight.

43
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:03,847
Machine Zone has stopped acquiring users in favor

44
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:05,208
of their new Final Fantasy game.

45
00:03:05,842 --> 00:03:08,123
But it's still astounding that the revenues of Game of War

46
00:03:08,183 --> 00:03:11,904
would fall so far so fast once the mighty advertising effort

47
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:12,704
came to an end.

48
00:03:16,565 --> 00:03:18,726
And another important event of last year

49
00:03:18,786 --> 00:03:20,866
was the release of the new App Store on iOS.

50
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:23,287
The top-grossing chart was removed,

51
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:25,547
but it made no difference as it hardly

52
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:27,228
affected the performance of the games in it.

53
00:03:28,328 --> 00:03:31,329
Kudos to Apple for creating editorial content around games

54
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:34,009
and highlighting well-designed games instead

55
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:34,990
of just what could sell.

56
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:38,542
For more information about how to succeed in the App Store,

57
00:03:38,822 --> 00:03:39,782
stay for the next session.

58
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,386
Last year I did a section on how the Russian publisher

59
00:03:48,466 --> 00:03:50,667
Playrix has combined a match three core

60
00:03:51,007 --> 00:03:53,508
with a builder wrapper with tremendous success.

61
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,049
Since then, they've launched another similar hybrid,

62
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:00,051
except that the building component is now in interior space

63
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:02,052
instead of the garden surrounding a mansion,

64
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:05,073
but with equally impressive top 15 success.

65
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,802
Roblox is an online service that empowers kids' creativity by letting them create games

66
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:18,284
and environments out of chunky, 3D, Minecraft-like graphics.

67
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:25,886
It originally launched in 2006 on the web, and this year burst onto the scene as a fixture

68
00:04:25,926 --> 00:04:30,428
in the top 20 grossing charts, after a mere seven years of grinding their way up.

69
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,330
The loot box controversy continues.

70
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:41,586
They have been the source of regulatory rambling for years.

71
00:04:42,126 --> 00:04:44,168
But the volume has ramped up in the past year.

72
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:46,871
As a result, and right before Christmas,

73
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:49,573
Apple announced that it's now requiring developers

74
00:04:49,613 --> 00:04:52,435
to disclose the odds of the likelihood of players

75
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:54,197
getting different types of items.

76
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:00,963
Instant games, games played on Facebook Messenger,

77
00:05:01,283 --> 00:05:02,944
are definitely a top story of the year,

78
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:05,146
gathering a lot of attention from both publishers

79
00:05:05,286 --> 00:05:05,887
and from the press.

80
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:11,430
However, there's an excellent session on instant games here in this room during the final time slot today,

81
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,332
so we decided not to spend any time covering instant games during this session.

82
00:05:18,134 --> 00:05:21,756
For our first topic of the day, we turn to the level-based progression genre.

83
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:25,819
So in the heyday of Facebook Canvas business,

84
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:31,162
the North American market was divvied up by the likes of Zynga, Playfish, Playdom, and CrowdStar.

85
00:05:31,902 --> 00:05:34,584
But there was a company in Istanbul called Peak Games.

86
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:38,362
And while they weren't making many inroads in the English-speaking world,

87
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:43,683
they were a very successful publisher across Turkey, Africa, and the Middle East.

88
00:05:45,483 --> 00:05:48,804
Well, Peak Games' minimal impact in North America changed dramatically

89
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:52,865
with the 2015 release of a level-based progression game called Toy Blast.

90
00:05:54,085 --> 00:05:58,567
This is a sub-genre of puzzle progression, which I generally refer to as block removal.

91
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:03,462
The player simply clicks or taps on a group of two or more light-colored blocks to remove them,

92
00:06:03,922 --> 00:06:07,185
and then the remaining blocks fall into place in the resulting gaps.

93
00:06:08,446 --> 00:06:12,188
Personally, I first saw this mechanic in a retail box game called Breakthrough,

94
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:15,531
released by Spectrum HoloByte in the mid-1990s,

95
00:06:16,111 --> 00:06:18,553
although there might be even earlier Asian precursors.

96
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:21,935
There are three main variants of this mechanic.

97
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:26,418
One, exhibited here in a venerable game house game called Collapse,

98
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,040
adds an arcadey aspect.

99
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:33,158
As you click to remove parts of the wall, this row at the bottom of the screen is filling.

100
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:38,800
Once it fills, it rises into the playing area, pushing the wall upward by a row.

101
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,262
You keep playing until one of the columns reaches the top of the screen, and you lose.

102
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:50,325
The second variant is more strategic and puzzly, as exhibited by King's Pet Rescue Saga on

103
00:06:50,345 --> 00:06:55,046
the right, and Pogo's Pop It on the left, in which gravity is turned upside down, but

104
00:06:55,087 --> 00:06:56,767
which otherwise is exactly the same game.

105
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:00,173
In this variant, no blocks are added as you play.

106
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:03,295
You just plan your moves to remove as many as possible.

107
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:09,040
And the third variant, of which Toy Blast is an example, as blocks are removed, more

108
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,483
blocks fall in from the top of the screen to replace them, just like in popular match

109
00:07:13,503 --> 00:07:15,665
three games such as Bejeweled and Candy Crush.

110
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:21,489
The gameplay revolves around a goal, or set of goals, for each level, and then a limited

111
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:25,252
number of moves in which to achieve those goals and avoid a failure.

112
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,001
Here's how Toy Blast has done in the approximately three years

113
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:31,521
that it's been live in the app stores.

114
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:34,262
Across iPhone, iPad, and Android,

115
00:07:34,302 --> 00:07:35,483
the story is quite similar.

116
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,803
About 1 and 1⁄2 years of growth,

117
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:40,604
and then 1 and 1⁄2 years comfortably ensconced

118
00:07:40,644 --> 00:07:43,665
in the top 25 grossing across all three major platforms.

119
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:47,427
Flash forward to about six months ago,

120
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:50,047
and the release of a second block removal game

121
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:52,868
by Peak Games, this one called Toon Blast.

122
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,062
The core gameplay is almost identical to that in Toy Blast.

123
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:01,686
Like Toy Blast, Toon Blast is an excellent implementation.

124
00:08:02,306 --> 00:08:05,208
The core gameplay is well made with saturated colors

125
00:08:05,268 --> 00:08:06,769
and satisfying animations.

126
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,171
The levels are well designed and balanced.

127
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:11,573
The boosts are well tutorialized.

128
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:14,615
There are plenty of rewards to keep players engaged.

129
00:08:14,976 --> 00:08:16,317
The characters are appealing.

130
00:08:16,717 --> 00:08:19,259
And the monetization is well planned and well executed.

131
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:22,141
Overall, a solid A-level implementation.

132
00:08:23,706 --> 00:08:26,567
So what has changed from Toy Blast to Toon Blast?

133
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:28,967
For one thing, there's the theme.

134
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,688
Whereas Toy Blast is set in a child's playroom

135
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:34,049
and focuses on toys and game pieces,

136
00:08:34,569 --> 00:08:37,349
Toon Blast is set in a classic animation world

137
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:39,570
of the 20th century, the sort of world

138
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,931
where Bugs Bunny and Wile E. Coyote and Tom and Jerry

139
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:43,591
would be at home.

140
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:48,292
These are the main characters, an anthropomorphic bear, wolf,

141
00:08:48,592 --> 00:08:48,932
and cat.

142
00:08:51,527 --> 00:08:56,469
The theme carries over into the level gameplay, with game pieces and power-ups evoking the

143
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:58,490
world of Roger Rabbit and Toontown.

144
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:05,093
And sometimes the inspiration for the world of Toonblast is startlingly explicit.

145
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:12,176
But what's most interesting, and even fascinating about Toonblast, isn't what's there.

146
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:14,137
It's what isn't there.

147
00:09:16,744 --> 00:09:19,345
Since the introduction of the level-based progression genre

148
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,086
with the King games in the early days of this decade,

149
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:24,286
would-be entrants into the genre

150
00:09:24,306 --> 00:09:26,447
have closely copied King's saga model,

151
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:29,128
including a meta-map to organize the levels.

152
00:09:29,928 --> 00:09:31,829
And in fact, Toy Blast had exactly

153
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:33,589
such a saga-style map shown here.

154
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,571
But Toon Blast has no such map whatsoever.

155
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:40,611
The only way to enter a level,

156
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:42,332
and in fact the only way to know

157
00:09:42,352 --> 00:09:43,832
what level you've reached so far,

158
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:45,933
is this button on your home screen.

159
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:50,006
There's no map to give you a narrative sense of a journey through an environment.

160
00:09:50,286 --> 00:09:52,648
There's no way to replay a level to get more stars.

161
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:55,591
There's no way to see your progress versus that of your friends.

162
00:09:56,792 --> 00:10:00,294
It's basically peak games acknowledging that the sort of social interactions

163
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:04,117
that were born on Facebook Canvas are not operant in the mobile arena

164
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:05,278
and never will be.

165
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,600
But in subtracting some...

166
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:08,681
Sorry.

167
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:13,145
By subtracting something as significant as the saga-style map,

168
00:10:13,785 --> 00:10:14,786
have they added anything?

169
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,540
Yes, this unobtrusive button here,

170
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:22,842
which takes you to a world of social gameplay.

171
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,124
Casual guilds that Toon Blast calls teams.

172
00:10:26,924 --> 00:10:29,546
You're placed onto such a team with 49 strangers.

173
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:33,148
No decisions to be made, not even naming your team.

174
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:35,609
You can chat with your teammates.

175
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:37,530
You can give them extra lives and hearts.

176
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,512
You can see the stats of the 50 players on your team

177
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:41,992
in a leaderboard-like layout.

178
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:44,674
There's a summary of the team's info.

179
00:10:45,536 --> 00:10:48,298
and special events like this team chess challenge,

180
00:10:48,358 --> 00:10:51,080
which is clearly influenced by the less casual clan

181
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,021
gameplay of Clash Royale.

182
00:10:54,242 --> 00:10:57,323
All in all, it's a startling and exciting experiment

183
00:10:57,484 --> 00:10:59,665
in casual social gameplay with strangers.

184
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:03,247
And the marketplace results?

185
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:05,549
Within a couple of months of launch,

186
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:08,471
Toon Blast was showing similar results to Toy Blast,

187
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:13,033
comfortably embedded in the top 25 grossing lists for all three

188
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:13,954
major platforms.

189
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:19,357
The first lesson here is that quality matters.

190
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:25,480
As I mentioned, Toon Blast isn't just a random level-based progression game innovating on

191
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,401
the metagame wrapper.

192
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:30,242
It's also a first-rate implementation of a block removal game.

193
00:11:31,843 --> 00:11:33,644
Second is that franchise matters.

194
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:39,567
Building on the back of the success of Toy Blast, which reached top 25 territory in about

195
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:44,590
18 months, Toon Blast reached the same level of success in just two or three months.

196
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,240
We've seen this pattern over and over in free-to-play games,

197
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,643
with Zynga's various Vil games, King's various Saga games,

198
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:56,585
more recently Supercell with nearly instant success

199
00:11:56,645 --> 00:12:01,668
by building Clash Royale on the super successful Clash of Clans franchise,

200
00:12:02,269 --> 00:12:05,190
and Playrix doing the same with the recent release of Homescapes.

201
00:12:08,012 --> 00:12:10,434
And the experimentation on the metagame front

202
00:12:10,954 --> 00:12:15,096
in games like Gummy Drop, Gardenscapes, and now Toon Blast,

203
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:20,368
shows that lots of different formats are possible when designing the metagame envelopes for these

204
00:12:20,428 --> 00:12:26,689
level-based puzzle games, and that companies are being richly rewarded for those experiments,

205
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,930
or at least for the most well thought out and most well executed of those experiments.

206
00:12:36,872 --> 00:12:44,473
So, since the dawn of human history, we've gathered together to be entertained.

207
00:12:45,187 --> 00:12:48,469
first in a mob all making music or telling stories together.

208
00:12:49,349 --> 00:12:52,031
Then slowly, we spawned professional entertainers

209
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,272
that would get up on stage.

210
00:12:53,432 --> 00:12:55,713
But still, hundreds, thousands of us

211
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,914
would gather together at a time and a place to watch this.

212
00:12:58,835 --> 00:13:00,415
Technology moved us further apart

213
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:02,477
as we began to record the performers.

214
00:13:02,857 --> 00:13:04,538
But still, we would huddle together

215
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:07,739
by the hundreds in theaters to see these great performances

216
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:08,740
played over and over.

217
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:11,822
This began to fragment further.

218
00:13:12,218 --> 00:13:16,801
in the middle of the last century as television came into the home and the viewing group moved

219
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:19,764
from hundreds of people together to a small family.

220
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:26,489
And then as we got DVRs and VCRs allowing us to watch our individual programs separately

221
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:28,411
when we wanted them on our own schedule.

222
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:36,157
Now streaming services like Netflix and Hulu bring the entire history of film and TV into

223
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:38,719
our homes when we want them and onto our phones as we want them.

224
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,840
And it's not just that way with movies.

225
00:13:41,465 --> 00:13:43,106
Consuming news has gone the same way.

226
00:13:43,526 --> 00:13:47,228
Solo where you want, so has music and even games.

227
00:13:49,369 --> 00:13:52,570
So I ask you, is this a one-way street?

228
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:58,032
Is there nothing that can reverse this trend of how we consume media?

229
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:00,593
It turns out the answer is...

230
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:03,194
HQ.

231
00:14:05,615 --> 00:14:08,976
It's a recently released game from the original makers of Vine,

232
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:10,597
the 15-second video sharing app.

233
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:14,645
For those of you who haven't seen it, it's a trivia game.

234
00:14:14,685 --> 00:14:16,646
It presents users with a series of questions.

235
00:14:17,647 --> 00:14:19,768
Questions are read out by a live host,

236
00:14:20,428 --> 00:14:23,050
and then players have only a few seconds to answer them,

237
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,032
to prevent them from Googling the answer.

238
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:27,513
The content is very well crafted.

239
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:30,595
Over the course of the game, the difficulty ramps up from

240
00:14:32,617 --> 00:14:37,300
trivial to excruciatingly difficult and obscure.

241
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,041
The answer, by the way, is Twister.

242
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:47,373
Every question feels momentous. You miss a single question and you're out of the game.

243
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:52,614
You have no more chance of winning. On early questions, this will knock out a few percentage

244
00:14:52,654 --> 00:14:59,315
of players, likely some bots. But as the game goes on, questions get very tricky and punishing,

245
00:15:01,035 --> 00:15:06,116
and you'll see devastation like this. It is worth mentioning that even after you're knocked out,

246
00:15:06,456 --> 00:15:09,977
the game is still fun to watch. The game itself,

247
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:12,590
is presented in a really interesting way.

248
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,090
It is a live stream.

249
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:17,152
It uses a combination of extremely simple motion graphics

250
00:15:18,213 --> 00:15:20,854
and live commentary from stand-up comedian hosts.

251
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:25,217
It feels very unlike playing a typical mobile game,

252
00:15:25,297 --> 00:15:27,718
a world that's available to you whenever you want it

253
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:30,300
in your kind of private space

254
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,181
and much more like being a live contestant

255
00:15:33,702 --> 00:15:34,682
on a TV game show.

256
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,223
because they're concentrating their entire player base

257
00:15:40,663 --> 00:15:42,305
into a single time window.

258
00:15:42,805 --> 00:15:44,807
It's not uncommon to see millions of people

259
00:15:44,927 --> 00:15:45,868
online for a match.

260
00:15:46,368 --> 00:15:47,970
And that's some serious technical load.

261
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,412
We're not talking about driving 2 or 2 and 1

262
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:52,594
half million DAU over the course of the game.

263
00:15:53,154 --> 00:15:56,717
These guys are pushing 2, 2 and 1 half million concurrent

264
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:59,119
viewers into their stream and consuming

265
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:02,002
huge amounts of bandwidth and venture capital to go with it.

266
00:16:04,107 --> 00:16:07,048
The game is live twice a day for approximately 20 minutes.

267
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:09,729
For the other 23 hours and 20 minutes of the day,

268
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:13,270
if you log into the app, you just see this UI screen.

269
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:15,971
This really gives players a sense

270
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:17,972
that they're participating in an event

271
00:16:18,232 --> 00:16:20,013
that if they don't get there on time,

272
00:16:20,033 --> 00:16:22,054
they're gonna miss out on a real opportunity.

273
00:16:23,534 --> 00:16:25,735
The game offers prizes ranging from $2,500 to $25,000

274
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:26,055
per session.

275
00:16:30,243 --> 00:16:32,945
Because the game draws up to two million players

276
00:16:33,145 --> 00:16:35,406
and the prizes are divided amongst all the players

277
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:37,187
that answer all 12 questions correctly,

278
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:41,850
sometimes the winnings can be a little underwhelming,

279
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:43,851
but it's still fun.

280
00:16:45,693 --> 00:16:47,294
The game has a light social layer

281
00:16:47,514 --> 00:16:48,835
where you can get extra lives

282
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,536
by inviting players to install the game.

283
00:16:50,656 --> 00:16:53,217
For each new install, you get an extra life

284
00:16:53,257 --> 00:16:54,898
that helps you overcome a missed question

285
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:55,759
and continue playing.

286
00:16:58,235 --> 00:17:03,659
The writers have done a good job of requiring a wide range of knowledge to be successful

287
00:17:03,699 --> 00:17:04,079
in the game.

288
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,761
This creates incentives for players to play together.

289
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:10,663
In the office I work in, four of us gather around every day at lunchtime to combine our

290
00:17:10,683 --> 00:17:11,584
knowledge and try to win.

291
00:17:12,444 --> 00:17:14,906
It works especially well with intergenerational groupings.

292
00:17:14,926 --> 00:17:20,469
There was a famous anecdote about news anchor Dan Rather, who gathered together on Christmas

293
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:24,852
Day with his children and grandchildren and managed to win HQ Trivia on his grandson's

294
00:17:24,892 --> 00:17:27,734
phone, leveraging their intergenerational knowledge pool.

295
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,731
The game has a somewhat unusual business model.

296
00:17:34,092 --> 00:17:37,473
They are giving money away with literally no monetization

297
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:37,913
in the game.

298
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:41,335
No ads, no in-app purchases, no subscription, no nothing.

299
00:17:42,155 --> 00:17:43,716
Right now, their sole goal appears

300
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:47,518
to be to amass a huge audience, build a big brand,

301
00:17:47,658 --> 00:17:49,418
and figure out the monetization later.

302
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:51,319
Given the high number of players,

303
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:52,980
it seems inevitable they'll get there

304
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,841
with something like pre-roll ads.

305
00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:02,225
selling extra lives, maybe subscriptions to one or two more private sessions per day for subscribers only.

306
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:04,967
There are a lot of ways to get there, but they're not trying yet.

307
00:18:06,028 --> 00:18:12,813
Aficionados of this series will know that this is the part of the lecture where we like to show the revenue curve for the app in question.

308
00:18:15,215 --> 00:18:20,698
But despite this lack of current revenues, there's a lot of confidence out there in the game's business model.

309
00:18:20,738 --> 00:18:24,121
It's inspired a variety of imitators that play extremely similarly.

310
00:18:24,777 --> 00:18:27,679
look very similar, and hope to grab a share of the pie.

311
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,901
So what can we learn from this?

312
00:18:32,102 --> 00:18:35,724
First of all, event-based apps can work.

313
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:40,648
HQ is down more than 23 hours of every day,

314
00:18:40,888 --> 00:18:44,150
but it's still driving multiple millions of DAU into it.

315
00:18:45,151 --> 00:18:46,591
And this could have some interesting relevance

316
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:47,192
for your game.

317
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,453
If there's something great to do that people really

318
00:18:49,493 --> 00:18:52,695
fear missing out on, it may be interesting to try and plan

319
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:53,396
a Flash event.

320
00:18:54,122 --> 00:18:55,943
that drives all your players in together

321
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:57,023
to share that experience.

322
00:18:58,023 --> 00:18:59,423
Do be sure to pick your times well.

323
00:18:59,783 --> 00:19:01,604
My office mates and I rarely play

324
00:19:01,664 --> 00:19:03,264
the 6 p.m. Pacific time matches

325
00:19:03,284 --> 00:19:04,564
because we're all on our commutes home.

326
00:19:06,324 --> 00:19:07,204
Content matters.

327
00:19:07,945 --> 00:19:09,845
HQ has done a spectacular job

328
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:11,365
of managing their difficulty curve

329
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:13,146
and writing their questions beautifully.

330
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,206
You need to provide a great experience

331
00:19:15,246 --> 00:19:17,926
if you want to drive that kind of mass adoption.

332
00:19:19,287 --> 00:19:20,607
Business model looks unproven,

333
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:22,367
but

334
00:19:23,265 --> 00:19:24,946
based on the way that they're driving audience

335
00:19:24,986 --> 00:19:27,087
and the possibilities that clearly exist in the app,

336
00:19:27,687 --> 00:19:29,268
I strongly suspect it's gonna get there.

337
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:32,730
And I'll see you in HQ at 12 and six.

338
00:19:37,112 --> 00:19:37,632
Thank you, Dave.

339
00:19:37,912 --> 00:19:40,953
I mean, one of my favorite things about HQ

340
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:44,055
or how it's becoming a popular culture phenomenon

341
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:48,837
is if you go on YouTube and Google people winning HQ,

342
00:19:49,037 --> 00:19:51,078
there are people doing video selfies of themselves

343
00:19:51,158 --> 00:19:52,458
as they answer the last question.

344
00:19:53,053 --> 00:19:55,373
And they're freaking out about winning $5.

345
00:19:57,794 --> 00:19:58,754
You should totally watch it.

346
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,595
So today I'm going to talk about the importance

347
00:20:02,655 --> 00:20:04,295
of collectible elements in mobile games.

348
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:06,396
And through my presentation, I'm going

349
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:09,597
to talk about the historical reasons of why we collect.

350
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:13,638
Since the beginning of time, humans have been gatherers.

351
00:20:14,418 --> 00:20:16,698
But our history of classification and collecting

352
00:20:16,938 --> 00:20:18,279
is only a few centuries old.

353
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:22,520
And most notably, I want to talk about this man, Sir Hans

354
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:22,900
Sloane.

355
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:27,085
Dr. Sloan lived in Jamaica for a portion of his life,

356
00:20:27,766 --> 00:20:29,368
and that's where he developed his obsession

357
00:20:29,408 --> 00:20:31,650
with collecting natural specimens of all kinds.

358
00:20:33,072 --> 00:20:34,233
When he got back to England,

359
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,955
he bought a three-story house in Chelsea

360
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:38,397
where he displayed every possible object

361
00:20:38,457 --> 00:20:39,518
he could fit on his walls.

362
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,643
At the time of his death, Sloan's collection

363
00:20:43,683 --> 00:20:46,045
consisted of around 71,000 objects of all kinds.

364
00:20:49,596 --> 00:20:55,099
This included some printed books, manuscripts, natural history specimens, prints, drawings,

365
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,041
and antiquities from all over the world.

366
00:20:58,302 --> 00:21:03,605
Per his wishes, this vast collection was bequeathed to the British nation, and that's how the

367
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,807
British Museum opened its doors.

368
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,909
Sloane donated his entire collection to the nation.

369
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,112
The British Museum is the first museum in history and today is one of the most important

370
00:21:13,152 --> 00:21:13,812
museums in the world.

371
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,775
Sir Hans Sloane wanted to be recognized.

372
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,850
Not in history books, if he could.

373
00:21:20,671 --> 00:21:22,972
His collection was what allowed him to do so.

374
00:21:25,273 --> 00:21:27,453
And what does he have to do with games, you might wonder.

375
00:21:28,074 --> 00:21:31,755
Well, almost every successful game in top grossing chart

376
00:21:32,055 --> 00:21:34,256
has a collection, and it's growing.

377
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:37,577
The newer games are for sure bringing

378
00:21:37,617 --> 00:21:39,578
collectional elements first and front.

379
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:41,819
This is a collection.

380
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,960
This is also a collection.

381
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:46,081
This is a collection.

382
00:21:47,327 --> 00:21:48,688
Even this one is a collection.

383
00:21:50,888 --> 00:21:53,029
It's the reason why players like this guy

384
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:55,049
spend two million dollars in modern war.

385
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,571
I strongly believe that players

386
00:21:58,591 --> 00:22:00,151
who are truly engaged with your game

387
00:22:00,651 --> 00:22:03,132
do feel there's an opportunity to do something grand.

388
00:22:06,013 --> 00:22:08,253
So let's talk about why do we collect.

389
00:22:09,434 --> 00:22:13,135
Understanding why will help you create the next hit game.

390
00:22:13,975 --> 00:22:14,815
Let's look at the reasons.

391
00:22:16,456 --> 00:22:16,936
A collection.

392
00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:18,399
brings significance.

393
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:23,443
In the 12th century, engineers figured out the high arches,

394
00:22:24,524 --> 00:22:26,886
common and seen in Gothic cathedrals today.

395
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:30,109
They allowed them to build taller structures,

396
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:35,333
reaching up to 150 feet, when a regular house was only

397
00:22:35,373 --> 00:22:36,053
a few feet tall.

398
00:22:37,474 --> 00:22:39,056
So then every town in Europe wanted

399
00:22:39,096 --> 00:22:40,537
to have their own Gothic cathedral,

400
00:22:40,957 --> 00:22:42,619
because it was going to put the town on the map.

401
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,441
In a similar way.

402
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:51,313
well-designed strategy games are those who allow the player to build significance in their land.

403
00:22:54,496 --> 00:22:57,218
Collections are important because they make their owners proud.

404
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:04,044
From the early times of the Crusades, every Christian kingdom had an obsession with obtaining

405
00:23:04,084 --> 00:23:11,211
a piece of wood from the Holy Cross, the cross Jesus Christ was crucified on. Here's an example

406
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:12,932
of a piece of the Holy Cross in a church in Vienna.

407
00:23:14,396 --> 00:23:16,377
And here is one piece in a church in Spain.

408
00:23:18,237 --> 00:23:19,678
However, this church in Jerusalem

409
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,099
wins the award for the biggest ornament

410
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,179
around a little piece of wood.

411
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,140
And by the way, at some point, researchers

412
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,141
did the counting of all the pieces across Europe

413
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:30,722
and came to the conclusion that an entire forest would have

414
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,923
been needed to fulfill all of them.

415
00:23:34,624 --> 00:23:36,024
But back to our point about games.

416
00:23:36,924 --> 00:23:39,045
Rarity and unique items are a key element

417
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,966
of gameplay in collections of successful games.

418
00:23:41,912 --> 00:23:44,613
Exemplified here are some of the rarest combatants,

419
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,634
the cards that you can have in Clash Royale.

420
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:48,855
In the next set of slides,

421
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:50,576
we'll see why collecting rare items

422
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:52,116
goes beyond being proud.

423
00:23:54,838 --> 00:23:57,179
A collection is valuable for not just the player,

424
00:23:57,779 --> 00:23:59,840
but for whomever admires it.

425
00:24:01,781 --> 00:24:03,902
One of the most successful art dealers of our time

426
00:24:03,922 --> 00:24:05,723
is this man, Joseph Duveen.

427
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:09,304
A Londoner who famously said,

428
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,405
Europe has a great deal of art.

429
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,459
and America has a great deal of money.

430
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:18,723
He made a connection and was instantly rich.

431
00:24:20,684 --> 00:24:22,906
He sold paintings to the richest Americans at the time,

432
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:25,268
like John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie.

433
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:29,251
But he built a very special relationship with this man,

434
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:33,654
William Randolph Hearst, the inspiration for Citizen Kane

435
00:24:34,315 --> 00:24:35,335
and the first media mogul.

436
00:24:37,257 --> 00:24:40,159
The first time Hearst visited Dubin's shop in London,

437
00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:42,627
He was made to wait 30 minutes.

438
00:24:44,268 --> 00:24:47,271
Once he came in, among all the works of art in the office

439
00:24:47,651 --> 00:24:50,454
prominently displayed was a Rembrandt.

440
00:24:51,775 --> 00:24:53,116
Hearst inquired about it.

441
00:24:54,517 --> 00:24:56,599
Instead of a price, De Ween inquired about

442
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:58,961
what other pieces of art Hearst owned,

443
00:25:00,643 --> 00:25:03,065
to which Hearst replied that he didn't own many.

444
00:25:04,806 --> 00:25:07,789
So De Ween flatly refused to sell the Rembrandt to Hearst.

445
00:25:09,415 --> 00:25:11,216
I cannot possibly sell it to you.

446
00:25:11,656 --> 00:25:13,978
This Rembrandt will be lonely," he said.

447
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,281
So for the next two years, Hearst proceeded

448
00:25:18,321 --> 00:25:20,423
to purchase many works from Duveen.

449
00:25:22,704 --> 00:25:26,267
In fact, we should thank Hearst because many

450
00:25:26,307 --> 00:25:28,228
of the Renaissance paintings that we

451
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:30,410
own in the United States were bought

452
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,351
by Hearst in the first place.

453
00:25:33,913 --> 00:25:37,015
So then, and only then, Duveen agreed

454
00:25:37,315 --> 00:25:38,436
to sell him the Rembrandt.

455
00:25:39,446 --> 00:25:42,149
and hers finally got his legendary card.

456
00:25:44,191 --> 00:25:45,853
And the win made both lots of money.

457
00:25:49,137 --> 00:25:50,178
Going back to Clash Royale,

458
00:25:50,898 --> 00:25:52,080
they do a good job of differentiating

459
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,942
between common cards and legendary ones.

460
00:25:55,203 --> 00:25:56,164
The shapes are different,

461
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:57,946
and the characters in those cards have significant,

462
00:25:57,966 --> 00:26:00,068
different and memorable actions in the battlefield.

463
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:04,640
However, the one thing that is very successful

464
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,320
is Supercell makes great use of online media,

465
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,841
working with influencers, and fans react,

466
00:26:09,921 --> 00:26:11,101
creating additional content

467
00:26:11,121 --> 00:26:12,521
that makes the rare cards well known.

468
00:26:13,162 --> 00:26:14,722
Search for Clash Royale on YouTube,

469
00:26:14,902 --> 00:26:16,102
and the first thing that you're gonna see

470
00:26:16,162 --> 00:26:17,703
is Clash Royale legendary cards.

471
00:26:18,683 --> 00:26:19,583
It's the most important thing.

472
00:26:24,524 --> 00:26:25,844
And in the game, there's a clear path

473
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:27,245
to obtain these super rare items.

474
00:26:27,445 --> 00:26:29,605
You can see how I'm scrolling through the cards I own.

475
00:26:30,456 --> 00:26:33,498
And then right after, it shows me the cards I don't own,

476
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,020
and after that, it shows me the cards

477
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,243
that I will be able to obtain once I reach a certain level.

478
00:26:40,763 --> 00:26:43,846
So it's super clear what my path to progression is,

479
00:26:44,086 --> 00:26:45,827
and that is super important.

480
00:26:46,207 --> 00:26:48,969
You need to tell people how to get the Rembrandt.

481
00:26:53,052 --> 00:26:53,593
In conclusion.

482
00:26:55,785 --> 00:27:00,409
For years, we have always evaluated the viability of a game by analyzing its core gameplay.

483
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:10,656
But we need to evaluate this not just about what is your core game mechanic, but also

484
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,878
what is your collection mechanic.

485
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,702
Because your players want to invest in something that has value, that makes them proud, and

486
00:27:19,782 --> 00:27:21,464
has significance in their lives.

487
00:27:23,505 --> 00:27:24,566
Like Sir Hans Sloane.

488
00:27:25,195 --> 00:27:28,296
who today should be considered the first whale.

489
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:31,097
Thank you.

490
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:38,799
And one more tidbit of trivia.

491
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:40,780
If you were wondering, yes, Sir Hansen Sloan is also the inventor of milk chocolate.

492
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,920
There's been a growth.

493
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,501
And if you're curious about the next video, click the link right there.

494
00:27:43,521 --> 00:27:44,341
And, until next time, thanks for watching.

495
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:52,163
And, I'll see you next time.

496
00:27:52,183 --> 00:27:52,243
Bye.

497
00:27:52,263 --> 00:27:52,323
Bye.

498
00:27:52,343 --> 00:27:52,403

517
00:27:54,504 --> 00:27:54,604
Bye.

518
00:27:54,624 --> 00:27:54,724
Bye.

519
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:54,804
Bye.

520
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:54,884
Bye.

521
00:27:55,485 --> 00:27:57,025
some might even say an explosion,

522
00:27:57,866 --> 00:28:00,067
of interactive story games on the App Store.

523
00:28:01,467 --> 00:28:04,209
These games are to some extent the spiritual successor

524
00:28:04,729 --> 00:28:06,650
of the sorts of choose-your-own-path novels

525
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,290
that perhaps some of you grew up reading.

526
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:12,152
The app that started this trend was Episode,

527
00:28:12,632 --> 00:28:14,493
from San Francisco-based Pocket Gems.

528
00:28:15,813 --> 00:28:18,555
It's not really a game, it's not really a story.

529
00:28:19,275 --> 00:28:22,536
What it is, is a platform for creating and dispensing

530
00:28:22,716 --> 00:28:24,217
any number of interactive stories.

531
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:29,812
Thematically, these stories fill into the soap opera or romance novel category,

532
00:28:30,272 --> 00:28:34,335
with high school or college settings and lots and lots of dating drama.

533
00:28:36,496 --> 00:28:40,398
Almost every story begins with you customizing the appearance of the main character.

534
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:45,141
This is the part of the story with the greatest amount of interactivity.

535
00:28:46,502 --> 00:28:51,425
Once you're past that avatar customization, the stories tend to have long stretches with no agency.

536
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:56,907
and with no interactivity beyond just tapping to get to the next line of dialogue or to the next scene.

537
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:01,491
Occasionally, on average, I'd say less than once per minute,

538
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:05,554
you get to make a choice that will actually have some kind of impact on the story.

539
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:09,117
This is also how episode monetizes.

540
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:12,080
Some of these choices have a cost associated with them.

541
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:19,185
Typically, the most dramatic, most salacious, and most revenge fantasy oriented of your choices.

542
00:29:21,461 --> 00:29:23,823
The choice displayed here would cost you roughly $2.

543
00:29:23,943 --> 00:29:27,906
These are almost like pay-to-play moments,

544
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:31,550
because the choices are so stark between do something exciting

545
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,191
and do nothing at all.

546
00:29:34,752 --> 00:29:37,114
It's as if, when you were approaching Emerald City,

547
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:39,656
the choices were enter and see the wizard,

548
00:29:41,118 --> 00:29:42,919
or just continue to wander aimlessly

549
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:44,080
around the forests of Oz.

550
00:29:47,047 --> 00:29:51,668
The game also monetizes by selling chapters using a currency called passes.

551
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:57,530
Like energy in Mafia Wars or Hearts in Candy Crush, you get a trickle of free passes over

552
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:57,871
time.

553
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:04,293
A pass can be purchased for about 30 cents, which lets you play one chapter.

554
00:30:05,894 --> 00:30:07,034
Or read one chapter.

555
00:30:07,354 --> 00:30:08,755
I'm not really sure what the right verb is.

556
00:30:11,498 --> 00:30:15,681
There are original stories, but there are also plenty of stories that use branded IP,

557
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:19,664
such as movies like Pitch Perfect or celebrities like Demi Lovato.

558
00:30:21,104 --> 00:30:26,868
The platform also allows for user-created stories, with mechanisms like voting and contests

559
00:30:26,968 --> 00:30:31,291
to surface the best-written and highest-quality stories to the episode community.

560
00:30:32,491 --> 00:30:37,955
These user-created stories feature information screens and author profiles, so authors can

561
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:39,776
even start to develop their own following.

562
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:46,444
These user-created stories allow for much broader sets of experiences and interests,

563
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:50,948
such as this user-created story that features a character who is a mute Muslim woman.

564
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:55,752
And what is the performance of Episode in the App Store?

565
00:30:57,594 --> 00:31:00,516
The results on Android and on the iPad are only middling.

566
00:31:01,077 --> 00:31:03,799
The game has rarely broken into the top 50 grossing.

567
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:09,063
But it's a totally different story on iPhone, where the game took a while to find its market

568
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:13,196
but since late 2015 has been consistently in the top 25,

569
00:31:13,736 --> 00:31:15,096
peaking as high as seventh.

570
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:18,257
Clearly the younger skewing audience for this game

571
00:31:18,317 --> 00:31:19,758
is a much more phone-oriented

572
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:21,238
than tablet-oriented audience.

573
00:31:23,219 --> 00:31:26,720
Then in mid-2016, Episode got a major competitor

574
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,120
in the form of Choices, Stories You Play,

575
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,801
from Mountain View-based Pixelberry Studios.

576
00:31:33,581 --> 00:31:35,802
Choices is closely modeled after Episode

577
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,263
with similar multi-story homepage.

578
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,766
a similar intro to each story chapter, similar start-of-game character customization, similar

579
00:31:44,806 --> 00:31:50,071
pacing of linear dialogues interrupted only occasionally by actual decision points, and

580
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:55,155
an identical monetization scheme via paying for the juiciest decisions or currency to

581
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:56,116
unlock new chapters.

582
00:31:57,497 --> 00:32:01,161
One difference is that Choices lacks the branded story content of Episode.

583
00:32:02,495 --> 00:32:07,598
It also has an achievement system which can give the app a somewhat stronger feeling of

584
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:08,778
a gameplay experience.

585
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:12,600
So how is Choices doing compared to Episode?

586
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:19,044
The grossing charts look almost identical, middling results on Android, which combines

587
00:32:19,124 --> 00:32:26,168
smartphone and tablet numbers onto a single chart, and unimpressive numbers on iPad, but

588
00:32:26,268 --> 00:32:27,708
excellent numbers on iPhone.

589
00:32:28,901 --> 00:32:33,384
As with episode, Choices has been firmly planted in the top 25 for the past year.

590
00:32:34,425 --> 00:32:38,268
Of course, while it took episode a couple of years to work its way into the top 25,

591
00:32:38,368 --> 00:32:40,009
Choices did it in about six months.

592
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:46,373
This parody and performance is pretty startling, given how imitative Choices is of episode.

593
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:51,697
In the past, we've seen imitative games come in and dominate their predecessors, such as

594
00:32:52,198 --> 00:32:55,960
World of Warcraft over EverQuest, or Candy Crush in the wake of Bejewelled.

595
00:32:56,381 --> 00:33:00,544
But in these cases, the successor games were clearly improvements on the games that came before.

596
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:05,088
Choices doesn't seem to be a clear improvement on Episode in any obvious way.

597
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:10,732
One possible explanation, Pocket Gems, in addition to their Episode business,

598
00:33:10,872 --> 00:33:14,195
has also been working on a major mid-core mobile game called War Dragons.

599
00:33:14,975 --> 00:33:19,359
It may be that this divided focus caused them to take their eye off the interactive story ball,

600
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:22,161
whereas Pixelberry, with no other focus, took advantage.

601
00:33:23,664 --> 00:33:28,787
In fact, Pixelberry parlayed the successive choices into an acquisition by Correa's Nexon

602
00:33:29,307 --> 00:33:31,549
this past November for an undisclosed sum.

603
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:38,033
And with episode and choices both making good money, the ranks are swelling with similar

604
00:33:38,093 --> 00:33:38,554
offerings.

605
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:44,798
First up is My Story from Nanobit, then Luvstruck from Voltage.

606
00:33:45,518 --> 00:33:49,721
As you can see, this game is in landscape mode, which in this category counts as rampant

607
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:50,122
innovation.

608
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:55,503
Ludia released What's Your Story?

609
00:33:57,343 --> 00:33:59,624
Then Chapters from Crazy Maple Studio.

610
00:34:01,365 --> 00:34:05,526
And most recently from NTT Solmar, the not at all subtly named

611
00:34:05,927 --> 00:34:08,527
My Shelf, My Choice, My Episode.

612
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:17,050
So the easy success of Choices seems to indicate that the market for these

613
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:20,072
sorts of interactive story games is still far from saturated.

614
00:34:20,779 --> 00:34:24,221
Although that might be changing with the flood of post-choices clones.

615
00:34:26,202 --> 00:34:30,185
As a designer, it's amazing to me how much affinity there is for games like these that

616
00:34:30,225 --> 00:34:33,807
have so little interactivity and so little player agency.

617
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:39,450
Not just a willingness to play games with such a low cadence of interaction, but a willingness

618
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:42,152
to pay for games with such a low cadence.

619
00:34:42,932 --> 00:34:47,795
I wonder what other genres we could dial down the cadence of interactivity without affecting

620
00:34:47,855 --> 00:34:48,756
player satisfaction.

621
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:55,418
And finally, more of a prediction than a lesson, we've seen very little variation

622
00:34:55,858 --> 00:35:00,180
among the games in this segment, all of which have pretty much been blindly following the

623
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,520
original episode formula.

624
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:06,842
But as this market gets more crowded, publishers are going to need to innovate to differentiate

625
00:35:06,882 --> 00:35:10,583
themselves, and I predict that over the next year or two we're going to see some pretty

626
00:35:10,623 --> 00:35:12,143
interesting developments in this genre.

627
00:35:19,605 --> 00:35:23,568
I'd like to say a few words about Golf Clash.

628
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:28,471
Now, this may come as a bit of a shock,

629
00:35:28,571 --> 00:35:31,793
but Golf Clash is a golf game

630
00:35:32,294 --> 00:35:34,435
from a company called Playdemic,

631
00:35:34,495 --> 00:35:36,176
recently acquired by Warner Brothers.

632
00:35:38,037 --> 00:35:40,619
In the main mode of play, you choose a course

633
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,342
and get matched up against a random opponent

634
00:35:44,362 --> 00:35:46,143
to play a single hole of golf.

635
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,281
As you start, you're taken to an overhead view,

636
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:54,104
and you have an extremely intuitive shot-making interface.

637
00:35:54,664 --> 00:35:58,647
You drag the targeting reticule to aim your shot,

638
00:35:59,587 --> 00:36:00,808
tap the take shot button,

639
00:36:02,529 --> 00:36:04,690
and then you go down to a golfer's eye view,

640
00:36:04,911 --> 00:36:07,172
you drag the ball backwards to set force

641
00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:08,713
and a little bit of additional spin,

642
00:36:09,454 --> 00:36:11,595
and then try and release your finger

643
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:14,277
just as the bouncing arrow goes over the center

644
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,118
of the target to shoot it as straight as possible.

645
00:36:16,994 --> 00:36:19,955
The physics feel great, the graphics look gorgeous,

646
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:22,957
the game plays well, it's a great experience,

647
00:36:22,977 --> 00:36:24,537
and that continues on to the putting green,

648
00:36:25,198 --> 00:36:28,199
where once again it's got the best putting interface

649
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:30,500
of any golf game I've played on any platform.

650
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,281
Simple and direct, drag the ball down

651
00:36:33,561 --> 00:36:35,622
to set direction and to set force.

652
00:36:36,343 --> 00:36:37,843
The blue vector comes out the front.

653
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:40,104
When you're gonna get it in the hole,

654
00:36:40,484 --> 00:36:42,425
the hole lights up, the flag pops out,

655
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:44,866
and then once again you play the bouncing arrow game

656
00:36:45,547 --> 00:36:46,807
to try and get it straight in.

657
00:36:50,562 --> 00:36:54,564
The player who gets the ball in the hole in the fewest shots wins the match.

658
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:58,587
If you tie, there's a one-shot playoff.

659
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:07,113
Whoever hits it closest to the hole gets some gold that's contributed from players' entry

660
00:37:07,153 --> 00:37:08,414
fees, some soft currency.

661
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:12,397
So why is this game worth talking about?

662
00:37:12,657 --> 00:37:14,598
We've seen casual sports titles before.

663
00:37:14,618 --> 00:37:19,001
8-ball pull from Miniclip has been a fixture in the top 50 for

664
00:37:19,984 --> 00:37:25,648
years. And they had some reasonable success with Archery King and Bowling King as well.

665
00:37:27,689 --> 00:37:35,875
Well, what is it that makes Golf Clash worth our attention? It has a very interesting metagame.

666
00:37:37,496 --> 00:37:42,039
So in Golf Clash, when you win a match, you gain trophies. When you lose a match, you

667
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,882
lose trophies. And you unlock access to new courses based on the number of trophies you

668
00:37:47,943 --> 00:37:48,243
have.

669
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:53,713
To play the game, you need to decide which clubs you're going to use.

670
00:37:53,753 --> 00:37:56,855
You need to make the right collection to suit your play style.

671
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:03,479
And you get access to different clubs by grinding your way through different courses.

672
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,022
Each club has a variety of statistics that make it play quite differently from the other

673
00:38:10,062 --> 00:38:16,066
clubs in its class, and you can upgrade them to increase their performance using the soft

674
00:38:16,126 --> 00:38:18,007
currency that you win from winning matches.

675
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,911
and cards you get from opening chests.

676
00:38:23,032 --> 00:38:24,192
Where do these chests come from?

677
00:38:24,272 --> 00:38:26,433
Why, you get one when you win a match.

678
00:38:27,354 --> 00:38:30,095
And then you insert it into one of four chest slots

679
00:38:30,215 --> 00:38:32,817
where you start a timer to open it later.

680
00:38:32,897 --> 00:38:36,258
And you can also get free chests every four hours

681
00:38:36,418 --> 00:38:40,160
and every eight holes that you get it in.

682
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,561
I don't know.

683
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:50,920
It all seems oddly familiar somehow. Where could I have seen this before? Could there be some game

684
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,204
where you win and lose trophies through play and use that to unlock new, you know, new battlegrounds

685
00:38:56,304 --> 00:39:02,189
and assemble collections of units to suit your play style that you get by reaching arenas and

686
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:09,714
upgrade them with money and cards and get chests and put them in chest slots? Huh.

687
00:39:12,095 --> 00:39:18,097
Yeah, Clash Royale. I mean, come on, people. They actually took half the name, right?

688
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:23,318
Just the metagame wasn't good enough. Now, that's not to say it's completely derivative.

689
00:39:23,378 --> 00:39:28,640
They did some really smart things to adapt the meta to their golf game. They have golf balls,

690
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,021
which are consumable goods. You use a ball that has extra power or wind resistance on a hole,

691
00:39:34,181 --> 00:39:38,722
and then it's gone. They have a nice multi-round tournament structure.

692
00:39:39,123 --> 00:39:41,704
that emulates the structure of real-world golf tournaments.

693
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:43,785
You have to qualify to play in the opening rounds

694
00:39:43,845 --> 00:39:44,686
to play in the finals.

695
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:48,748
They do a great offer of constantly surfacing

696
00:39:48,868 --> 00:39:51,710
great value deals for cash to add to monetization.

697
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,152
They also threw away the mid-core clans of Clash Royale

698
00:39:56,232 --> 00:39:57,453
and replaced them with simpler

699
00:39:57,593 --> 00:39:59,234
and more casual social structures.

700
00:40:01,475 --> 00:40:04,016
Like Facebook-style gifting of soft currency

701
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:05,717
and golf balls and a few gems.

702
00:40:06,662 --> 00:40:09,284
And also, every week, they place you into a league

703
00:40:09,624 --> 00:40:12,727
with 99 random strangers at the same level of accomplishment.

704
00:40:13,648 --> 00:40:15,549
At the end of the week, the 25 top players

705
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:17,231
get promoted into the next highest league

706
00:40:17,371 --> 00:40:19,393
and get better bonuses when they open their chests.

707
00:40:20,674 --> 00:40:25,258
But really, at its core, it's extremely similar

708
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,579
to the Clash Royale metagame.

709
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:30,122
Now, this is not the first time we've seen a metagame lifted

710
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:31,423
on the App Store, right?

711
00:40:32,404 --> 00:40:34,225
How many puzzle games have shown you

712
00:40:34,955 --> 00:40:38,437
a reskin of this exact Candy Crush saga map.

713
00:40:39,318 --> 00:40:40,459
Dozens if not hundreds.

714
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,363
How many RPGs have shown you this exact

715
00:40:45,763 --> 00:40:48,485
hero upgrade screen from Heroes Charge?

716
00:40:49,706 --> 00:40:51,067
Answer, all of them.

717
00:40:52,968 --> 00:40:56,531
But these guys have had huge success

718
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:57,732
within their own genres.

719
00:40:58,192 --> 00:41:00,594
Golf Clash is one of the first examples we've seen

720
00:41:00,654 --> 00:41:02,996
of a complete metagame transplant.

721
00:41:03,653 --> 00:41:05,793
from one genre, real-time strategy,

722
00:41:06,553 --> 00:41:09,434
into a completely different one, casual sports.

723
00:41:10,454 --> 00:41:11,815
And it's been done to great effect.

724
00:41:12,795 --> 00:41:14,535
As you can see, after a period of growth,

725
00:41:15,355 --> 00:41:20,896
the game has stayed in the top 25 on Android and on iPhone.

726
00:41:21,657 --> 00:41:23,357
It hasn't performed as well on tablet,

727
00:41:24,157 --> 00:41:26,758
perhaps because the game is so friendly

728
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,618
to those little two or three-minute windows

729
00:41:28,658 --> 00:41:30,718
you find yourself with throughout the day with your phone.

730
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,751
So what can we learn from this?

731
00:41:35,111 --> 00:41:39,392
We now have a second proof point for casual sports taking up

732
00:41:39,432 --> 00:41:41,152
habitual residence in the top 50.

733
00:41:42,012 --> 00:41:44,913
This is a category that the App Store has some appetite for.

734
00:41:46,513 --> 00:41:49,734
Number two, the Clash Royale metagame

735
00:41:50,114 --> 00:41:52,774
has joined the lexicon of highly portable metagames.

736
00:41:53,034 --> 00:41:55,575
It belongs in every mobile game designer's toolkit

737
00:41:56,315 --> 00:41:59,275
and has shown great resilience moving from genre to genre.

738
00:42:00,623 --> 00:42:04,524
And third, the market doesn't really seem to be punishing this adaptation

739
00:42:05,205 --> 00:42:07,545
because of a few things that Golf Clash has done,

740
00:42:07,986 --> 00:42:12,847
like build a great core game with fantastic usability, great physics,

741
00:42:13,488 --> 00:42:15,028
really fun and satisfying to play.

742
00:42:16,689 --> 00:42:18,829
They've integrated the metagame very smartly.

743
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:19,930
It's meaningful.

744
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,831
It works in the context of the core game.

745
00:42:21,871 --> 00:42:24,131
The progression makes sense and is relevant.

746
00:42:25,472 --> 00:42:28,613
And they've added a few clever twists to make it their own

747
00:42:28,673 --> 00:42:29,693
and make it really shine.

748
00:42:33,995 --> 00:42:35,556
The last part of our presentation,

749
00:42:36,576 --> 00:42:39,317
I'm going to be talking about a few games

750
00:42:40,097 --> 00:42:43,778
where the game mechanic was something interesting

751
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:44,878
and worth mentioning.

752
00:42:46,178 --> 00:42:47,918
First game is called Flipping Legend.

753
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:53,080
And in this game, basically, they

754
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,460
thought about how can we make it a runner's style of game,

755
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,721
but still just making it about avoiding enemies,

756
00:43:00,341 --> 00:43:01,942
we're talking about fighting them.

757
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:11,444
So, as in many runner games, you have three lanes, and in this case, your goal is to jump

758
00:43:11,604 --> 00:43:12,764
over the enemies and kill them.

759
00:43:13,984 --> 00:43:20,266
But in order to add a sense of agency and urging like runners do with the constant scrolling,

760
00:43:20,686 --> 00:43:25,488
in this case, your life bar goes down the more time you haven't killed anybody.

761
00:43:26,448 --> 00:43:32,050
So the game continues and forces you to play as dynamic as possible.

762
00:43:32,725 --> 00:43:35,706
And as you move forward, there are new elements of gameplay,

763
00:43:35,766 --> 00:43:37,466
such as objects being thrown at you,

764
00:43:38,147 --> 00:43:42,908
and you can move from one wall to hit the wall on the left,

765
00:43:43,088 --> 00:43:44,348
appear on the right, and vice versa.

766
00:43:47,429 --> 00:43:49,509
The next game I want to talk about is called Race Kings.

767
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:55,251
By the way, tomorrow, at the Indie Game Stories session,

768
00:43:56,311 --> 00:43:58,632
the maker of Flipping Legend is going to do a post-mortem.

769
00:43:59,332 --> 00:44:01,372
As well, the makers of Race Kings.

770
00:44:02,497 --> 00:44:09,763
So in this game, basically it's a head to head online drifting game.

771
00:44:10,864 --> 00:44:14,867
And the left side of the screen allows you to press the handbrake

772
00:44:15,007 --> 00:44:16,808
and the right side of the screen allows you to accelerate.

773
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:23,814
Combining both actions allows you to turn your car and drift.

774
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:31,700
And you have to keep your gas pedal around the blue zone of the accelerator meter.

775
00:44:32,761 --> 00:44:38,505
And like I said, the game is always head to head, you compete against other players,

776
00:44:39,185 --> 00:44:42,787
and there are multiple cards that you can purchase and upgrades that you can do to the game.

777
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:52,994
Next game is called Faust. And Faust takes inspiration on old style arcade games.

778
00:44:53,754 --> 00:44:58,617
And basically you have this white character and your left side of the screen allows you to jump

779
00:44:58,857 --> 00:44:59,758
towards the left.

780
00:45:00,437 --> 00:45:02,799
right side of the screen, jump towards the right, and it's gravity.

781
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:04,660
Your character is constantly falling.

782
00:45:06,522 --> 00:45:09,564
The way that you combat against, fight against the enemies

783
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,026
is by jumping over them in order to kill them.

784
00:45:12,747 --> 00:45:15,709
But the one thing that I was really engaged with this game

785
00:45:15,889 --> 00:45:18,031
is that every time I kill somebody, I earn one coin.

786
00:45:18,752 --> 00:45:21,474
And there are permanent upgrades I can buy.

787
00:45:22,095 --> 00:45:26,779
So when I buy an upgrade, this is a video of a level much further ahead.

788
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:29,541
I, for example, now have a bomb.

789
00:45:30,065 --> 00:45:31,205
and also a homing missile.

790
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,267
So now my mechanic is not to get closer to the enemy,

791
00:45:34,347 --> 00:45:36,068
but rather go farther away.

792
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:38,269
It completely changes how I play the game.

793
00:45:39,429 --> 00:45:43,151
And as you continue upgrading, doing permanent upgrades,

794
00:45:43,652 --> 00:45:44,992
it also changes again.

795
00:45:45,012 --> 00:45:46,833
I thought it was really clever.

796
00:45:48,974 --> 00:45:50,115
Next game I'm going to talk about

797
00:45:50,175 --> 00:45:51,456
is called Talking Tom Pool.

798
00:45:52,756 --> 00:45:58,259
And Talking Tom Pool combines elements of a basic arcade

799
00:45:58,673 --> 00:46:02,054
play on mobile plus color matching mechanics.

800
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:07,415
So the goal here is to drag my finger on one of these cute animals

801
00:46:07,955 --> 00:46:11,596
and have them slide towards the other animals of the same color.

802
00:46:12,176 --> 00:46:15,757
Looks very simple, but interesting enough as the levels...

803
00:46:17,417 --> 00:46:20,778
As you progress through the game, the levels start adding new elements of gameplay.

804
00:46:21,498 --> 00:46:26,680
And with these new elements of gameplay, then it becomes a lot more interesting.

805
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:33,596
So for example, this is an example of a level where we have frozen animals that we have to hit

806
00:46:34,356 --> 00:46:41,743
and also power-ups that allows us to get a boost. And because of the limited elements in the screen,

807
00:46:41,943 --> 00:46:44,826
you have to plan strategically what your best move is.

808
00:46:47,348 --> 00:46:52,873
Lastly, I love this game. It's called Battle Golf Online. It's a head-to-head game where

809
00:46:53,249 --> 00:46:55,610
you basically have two actions that you need to do.

810
00:46:55,790 --> 00:47:00,611
Number one is to tap to find the right angle.

811
00:47:01,131 --> 00:47:03,791
And number two is tap again to set your strength.

812
00:47:04,451 --> 00:47:06,592
Your goal is to shoot the ball in the hole

813
00:47:06,632 --> 00:47:07,932
before your opponent does.

814
00:47:08,432 --> 00:47:09,833
So there's a little bit of prediction

815
00:47:09,873 --> 00:47:12,673
of when the next hole is gonna appear, right?

816
00:47:13,493 --> 00:47:16,314
But also there's precision in terms

817
00:47:16,394 --> 00:47:17,874
of where you have to shoot the ball.

818
00:47:18,774 --> 00:47:20,835
And it's a game play to five.

819
00:47:21,695 --> 00:47:21,875
And a.

820
00:47:23,563 --> 00:47:29,846
you get to upgrade your looks as you earn coins and stuff.

821
00:47:32,828 --> 00:47:33,828
And that's it.

822
00:47:34,649 --> 00:47:39,371
So before we go, we wanna say that please,

823
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:42,553
it helps us if you fill your evaluation forms,

824
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:45,495
you get your feedback and know what we did good

825
00:47:45,535 --> 00:47:47,656
and what we didn't do well this year.

826
00:47:48,336 --> 00:47:49,477
And we're open for Q&A.

827
00:47:49,697 --> 00:47:51,578
So please, if you can get to the mics, that'd be great.

828
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:10,659
No questions?

829
00:48:12,981 --> 00:48:14,201
Quick, Dave, say something embarrassing.

830
00:48:16,523 --> 00:48:16,903
We got one.

831
00:48:17,543 --> 00:48:17,804
Hi there.

832
00:48:18,004 --> 00:48:18,164
Hi.

833
00:48:19,325 --> 00:48:19,725
Go ahead.

834
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:23,327
Thank you for your lecture.

835
00:48:25,188 --> 00:48:26,909
For me, it was strange that you...

836
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:29,551
Sorry, it's my first question on GDC ever, so...

837
00:48:30,051 --> 00:48:31,632
I know the whole procedure.

838
00:48:32,393 --> 00:48:32,613
So...

839
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:40,645
As for me, this year was a lot about how to put PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds on mobile.

840
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:45,768
And strange that you didn't mention that.

841
00:48:46,209 --> 00:48:55,956
So what are your thoughts about all this race of PUBG clones on mobile?

842
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,079
I didn't even know it was available on mobile.

843
00:49:04,486 --> 00:49:06,447
Yeah, I'm not very up on my PUBG.

844
00:49:07,768 --> 00:49:11,070
I mean, it's an interesting game, but it's not available on mobile, so why would we talk about it?

845
00:49:12,071 --> 00:49:13,672
Well, yeah, there's...

846
00:49:15,133 --> 00:49:15,513
Two weeks?

847
00:49:15,773 --> 00:49:16,073
Yeah.

848
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:24,399
Okay. It's a two-week-old release, so basically it's gonna be 2018 probably will be a year of PUBG.

849
00:49:25,339 --> 00:49:29,362
Battlegrounds, if it will be, right? But not in 2017.

850
00:49:29,582 --> 00:49:32,264
I already played like 12 clones.

851
00:49:33,126 --> 00:49:37,407
Yeah, I mean, I think it'll be interesting to see what the results of those are, right?

852
00:49:37,527 --> 00:49:42,849
Obviously, there's a huge appetite for those kind of battle royale games on PC, right?

853
00:49:42,869 --> 00:49:46,330
They've kind of crushed the charts in terms of viewership and sales.

854
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:53,111
But we've also seen historically a lot of genres that work really well on PC or on console,

855
00:49:53,171 --> 00:49:53,371
right?

856
00:49:53,411 --> 00:49:59,913
That demand kind of long sessions of focused attention really struggle to break through

857
00:50:00,053 --> 00:50:00,553
on mobile.

858
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,992
I feel like we're still waiting for the first great mobile MOBA,

859
00:50:04,932 --> 00:50:07,654
and folks have been pushing on that for quite a while.

860
00:50:08,294 --> 00:50:11,356
So even though we're kind of seeing those direct migrations,

861
00:50:12,016 --> 00:50:16,679
I think it's going to be some number of years of kind

862
00:50:16,699 --> 00:50:18,960
of iteration and adaptation and really thinking

863
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,742
about what that means to have the right battle royale

864
00:50:21,782 --> 00:50:25,284
game for MOBA before we see that same kind of huge crushing

865
00:50:25,324 --> 00:50:26,524
success on the mobile charts.

866
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:28,986
Sounds reasonable.

867
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:29,386
Thanks.

868
00:50:30,386 --> 00:50:30,607
Sure.

869
00:50:32,141 --> 00:50:32,741
And good question.

870
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:33,061
Thank you.

871
00:50:35,942 --> 00:50:37,403
Thanks for your lecture.

872
00:50:39,323 --> 00:50:44,084
For me, HQ was probably the biggest surprise for 2017 and

873
00:50:44,725 --> 00:50:45,585
very interesting.

874
00:50:46,665 --> 00:50:52,107
But still, it's a company who has a lot of funds available

875
00:50:52,207 --> 00:50:53,267
to make this happen.

876
00:50:54,548 --> 00:50:58,509
And generally, the success of mobile seems to be only

877
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:01,790
possible nowadays with a lot of money, basically.

878
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:09,476
Do you think there could be success without huge funding just because of the gameplay is so great?

879
00:51:09,536 --> 00:51:15,301
Or do you see any game that you have seen in 2017 where you expect it to grow further in 2018?

880
00:51:17,923 --> 00:51:21,366
Well, define huge budget and define success.

881
00:51:22,547 --> 00:51:31,474
I mean, one of the games which is in the top 20 of the app stores continuously throughout the year.

882
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,983
which hasn't been there before and is knocked back by like a

883
00:51:37,264 --> 00:51:40,767
established publisher and very big IP, something like that.

884
00:51:42,448 --> 00:51:48,673
Yeah, I think it's very hard at this point to crack the top 20,

885
00:51:49,654 --> 00:51:51,795
you know, particularly on the grossing charts

886
00:51:52,556 --> 00:51:55,618
without some significant source of funding.

887
00:51:56,879 --> 00:52:00,382
Although I suppose the inverse question is, you know,

888
00:52:00,722 --> 00:52:01,183
if you

889
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:04,940
don't have significant funding in your company

890
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,461
and you don't have to please investors,

891
00:52:06,481 --> 00:52:08,643
but rather generate a revenue stream

892
00:52:08,663 --> 00:52:10,164
that works for supporting your team,

893
00:52:11,284 --> 00:52:13,826
do you need to target being in the top 20?

894
00:52:14,567 --> 00:52:20,250
I worked on a very successful project

895
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:24,653
that launched I think in early 2016.

896
00:52:25,874 --> 00:52:27,515
Trailer Park Boys, Greasy Money,

897
00:52:28,115 --> 00:52:29,996
it was a kind of low seven figure.

898
00:52:30,769 --> 00:52:32,510
budget in part because of a restart.

899
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:34,030
Like, had we had the true course,

900
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,371
the game probably could have been built for half that.

901
00:52:37,211 --> 00:52:40,472
And, you know, it's been in the top 100 intermittently,

902
00:52:41,252 --> 00:52:43,893
stays within the top 200, and does really, really well

903
00:52:44,753 --> 00:52:46,954
for the company that built it that has, you know,

904
00:52:47,154 --> 00:52:48,715
a few dozen people, right?

905
00:52:48,755 --> 00:52:50,335
It's a huge financial success for them.

906
00:52:51,355 --> 00:52:53,876
There's also the, you know, the question of,

907
00:52:54,056 --> 00:52:56,197
do you have to have a giant hit right out of the gate,

908
00:52:56,797 --> 00:52:58,818
or can you slowly build the business over time?

909
00:52:59,687 --> 00:53:01,929
And I think we see examples like Playrix,

910
00:53:02,029 --> 00:53:05,450
the makers of homescapes and gardenscapes.

911
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:08,452
They didn't have that mega success their first time out,

912
00:53:08,492 --> 00:53:10,513
but they gradually built an audience,

913
00:53:10,553 --> 00:53:12,214
they gradually built up expertise.

914
00:53:12,334 --> 00:53:17,017
And as in the case of Toon Blast,

915
00:53:17,737 --> 00:53:20,779
building on the success of Toy Blast,

916
00:53:21,179 --> 00:53:25,481
with each game, you can kind of build on the foundation

917
00:53:25,561 --> 00:53:28,563
that you've already created and over many years,

918
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:29,303
get to that point.

919
00:53:29,724 --> 00:53:34,245
Well, not only that, but the original Toy Blast, I think,

920
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:38,166
took two or three years to reach that kind of top 25 grossing.

921
00:53:38,206 --> 00:53:38,406
Right.

922
00:53:38,486 --> 00:53:40,506
And of course, that wasn't Peak Games' first game.

923
00:53:40,566 --> 00:53:43,967
They were building that on quite many years of expertise.

924
00:53:44,947 --> 00:53:45,447
Absolutely.

925
00:53:46,508 --> 00:53:46,768
OK.

926
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:47,788
Thank you very much.

927
00:53:50,348 --> 00:53:50,528
Yes.

928
00:53:52,989 --> 00:53:53,189
Hi.

929
00:53:53,649 --> 00:53:57,030
My question is regarding the choice-based narrative games,

930
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:59,330
because I've noticed often that.

931
00:53:59,765 --> 00:54:03,547
all these choices are aimed towards the younger female audience demographic

932
00:54:04,027 --> 00:54:07,649
and yet your slide that our familiarity with the 80s genre of the choose your own

933
00:54:07,669 --> 00:54:08,129
adventure

934
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:11,291
weren't skewed that way and I'm always trying to find

935
00:54:11,591 --> 00:54:15,974
that explanation it's whether because there's the RPG world that has the male

936
00:54:16,074 --> 00:54:18,755
audience demographic already but why are these choice-based

937
00:54:19,056 --> 00:54:21,757
games mostly female audience driven?

938
00:54:22,918 --> 00:54:26,620
Well certainly Episode is the first one out of the gate was aimed that way

939
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,341
and achieved success and

940
00:54:28,998 --> 00:54:31,499
and therefore, you know, everyone else has been doing that.

941
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:37,180
You know, could the same format be appealing to other demographics?

942
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,120
No one has tried yet.

943
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:45,862
You know, my guess is that, you know, episode, you know, kind of hit the sweet spot out of

944
00:54:45,902 --> 00:54:52,523
the gate and that, you know, while other demographics might have some, you know, success, it wouldn't

945
00:54:52,743 --> 00:54:56,464
equal the success that, you know, that has been with the.

946
00:54:57,099 --> 00:55:01,421
younger and primarily female audience of episode and choices.

947
00:55:03,062 --> 00:55:06,684
But I certainly hope someone tries because it'll be interesting to see the results of that.

948
00:55:10,987 --> 00:55:14,689
We have time for a couple more questions if anyone has oh yay here comes a question.

949
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:18,671
Either that or he's going to rush the stage and do violent things.

950
00:55:18,911 --> 00:55:22,914
Hello, yeah it's kind of leading on from the first question actually.

951
00:55:23,394 --> 00:55:25,055
Something that I've noticed is that

952
00:55:26,998 --> 00:55:30,899
the shorts, you know, we've always sought for mobile games that short sessions of the

953
00:55:30,939 --> 00:55:37,021
win are the only way to do it. But actually, there are a few exceptions to that, like Pixel

954
00:55:37,461 --> 00:55:44,103
Gun 3D, Rules of Survival, and Fortnite is now doing amazingly well. So I think things

955
00:55:44,183 --> 00:55:46,024
are changing. And you have the 5v5 MOBA game up there.

956
00:55:48,098 --> 00:55:51,379
I'm curious to know why you didn't mention that,

957
00:55:51,439 --> 00:55:54,080
because that movement away from short session

958
00:55:54,981 --> 00:55:59,342
and console games and PC games coming to mobile and succeeding,

959
00:55:59,763 --> 00:56:02,183
Lineage 2 is another one.

960
00:56:02,684 --> 00:56:05,385
I feel that, yes, there's a trend.

961
00:56:06,005 --> 00:56:11,347
Pixel Gun 3D is a few years old, not necessarily a new game.

962
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:15,229
But I see that there is better success in games

963
00:56:15,429 --> 00:56:17,710
that are different.

964
00:56:18,365 --> 00:56:20,826
game mechanics specifically made for the phone.

965
00:56:21,026 --> 00:56:25,007
And I'm going to always say that Marvel Contest of Champions

966
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:28,027
is probably one of the best arcade games ever designed

967
00:56:28,047 --> 00:56:28,688
for a mobile phone.

968
00:56:30,128 --> 00:56:33,088
And it's the reason why it's still in the top 10.

969
00:56:33,769 --> 00:56:37,649
And I believe that your success, your long-term success,

970
00:56:38,029 --> 00:56:42,050
is closer to creating an arcade game mechanic or an action

971
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:44,511
game mechanic that is specifically designed

972
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:47,772
for the mobile phone rather than try to cram.

973
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:50,764
what the console or the PC gaming experience is.

974
00:56:51,504 --> 00:56:53,206
That's a still short session game.

975
00:56:53,306 --> 00:56:55,828
That's still a short session game.

976
00:56:55,868 --> 00:56:59,111
Contest of Champions. You have to fight to put it down.

977
00:56:59,651 --> 00:57:01,833
What's interesting is that there are games emerging

978
00:57:02,694 --> 00:57:05,196
where you can play them for hours.

979
00:57:05,416 --> 00:57:08,379
And the survival kind of games where you can, you know,

980
00:57:08,399 --> 00:57:11,021
like PUBG, you can play that.

981
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:15,185
The sessions won't be very long and you can play the chunks.

982
00:57:15,853 --> 00:57:18,614
I think there's an interesting distinction there, right?

983
00:57:18,754 --> 00:57:23,815
So one of the, there are certainly many games on mobile

984
00:57:23,855 --> 00:57:26,176
that you can play for hours, right?

985
00:57:26,216 --> 00:57:27,556
And that have had some success.

986
00:57:27,576 --> 00:57:30,297
So take a look at, for instance, Hearthstone, right?

987
00:57:30,337 --> 00:57:33,958
It's not that hard to have a 90 minute Hearthstone session.

988
00:57:34,819 --> 00:57:38,500
I've had many, but it also sort of allows you

989
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,080
to get through and do something meaningful

990
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,161
in five to 10 minutes.

991
00:57:43,164 --> 00:57:49,566
watching the progress of games that demand really long session times, right, in order

992
00:57:49,606 --> 00:57:55,048
to do something meaningful, and seeing what they can do on mobile, it'll be really interesting

993
00:57:55,088 --> 00:57:57,769
to see what happens with that over the coming year, right?

994
00:57:58,409 --> 00:58:04,791
I think it doesn't necessarily play to a lot of the strengths of the platform, which are

995
00:58:04,911 --> 00:58:09,472
its kind of ubiquity and its ability to slot into those little dead moments that you have,

996
00:58:09,592 --> 00:58:11,633
what I sort of call the Starbucks factor.

997
00:58:12,502 --> 00:58:15,803
Right? Games that you can do something meaningful in while you're waiting for your latte.

998
00:58:16,824 --> 00:58:20,946
It'll be really interesting to see if developers can bring a critical mass of players over.

999
00:58:21,746 --> 00:58:25,028
And I think the coming year is going to be a super interesting test lab for that,

1000
00:58:25,328 --> 00:58:27,069
with these Battle Royale games coming in.

1001
00:58:31,911 --> 00:58:35,513
I think we have time for one last question.

1002
00:58:35,533 --> 00:58:37,154
Yep, go ahead.

1003
00:58:38,497 --> 00:58:42,017
I was wondering if you had any more insights as to why the stranger mechanic actually works.

1004
00:58:42,577 --> 00:58:47,878
I understand it reduces friction and maybe getting a group or a clan of like-minded people

1005
00:58:47,898 --> 00:58:52,499
together, but couldn't that just be bots kind of posting things to each other?

1006
00:58:53,179 --> 00:58:56,720
What drives that kind of as a long-term mechanic that works?

1007
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:03,041
Well, one thing that we found in a lot of the sort of social research we've done, you

1008
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:07,702
know, especially, you know, more recently compared to kind of the early days of canvas

1009
00:59:07,722 --> 00:59:08,002
gaming.

1010
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:12,682
is players have grown to be reluctant to bother their friends.

1011
00:59:14,643 --> 00:59:18,424
Other than, you know, perhaps a very small handful of friends who you know are really

1012
00:59:18,465 --> 00:59:24,587
into the same game that you're into, players feel, oh, I'm, you know, I'm, I don't want to

1013
00:59:24,627 --> 00:59:30,930
hound my friends, I don't want to feel like I'm irking them. And also another thing that we hear

1014
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:37,933
a lot is, I don't want to, I don't want my friends to know how much I play games.

1015
00:59:38,851 --> 00:59:43,615
There's sort of a little bit of embarrassment or a little bit of feeling like, you know,

1016
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:46,837
I'm not doing something I should be doing by playing so much.

1017
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:52,041
Whereas, you know, this sort of play with strangers, you know, because it's the same

1018
00:59:52,241 --> 00:59:58,606
kinds of light interaction, like I need a life, it's not like, you know, the fact that

1019
00:59:58,626 --> 01:00:03,710
they're strangers is that big a deal, you know, the interactions aren't that deep, and

1020
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:07,673
yet you know that, you know, you're not bothering a friend in those sorts of ways.

1021
01:00:12,665 --> 01:00:15,367
Yeah, I think we know that the social component of games,

1022
01:00:15,447 --> 01:00:17,668
motivating people to compete, to collaborate,

1023
01:00:17,688 --> 01:00:19,770
is really important to a huge segment.

1024
01:00:21,591 --> 01:00:26,834
And we also know that uptake for most games on Facebook Connect,

1025
01:00:27,294 --> 01:00:29,195
where it's offered, is usually sub 50%.

1026
01:00:30,776 --> 01:00:34,698
So you don't want to take that majority of your player

1027
01:00:34,739 --> 01:00:37,660
population and not enable a social experience for them.

1028
01:00:38,421 --> 01:00:39,842
So using that kind of.

1029
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:46,814
random group of strangers within a competitive band gives you some social interaction, something

1030
01:00:46,834 --> 01:00:48,095
to do for the rest of those players.

1031
01:00:51,397 --> 01:00:55,040
All right, thank you all so much for coming, and have a great GDC.
