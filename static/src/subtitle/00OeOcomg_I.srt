Hi, my name is Stefan Dillie and I'm the Head of Frontend Engineering at InnoGames.

2
00:00:04,052 --> 00:00:06,835
After focusing on browser games for close to a decade now,

3
00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:09,417
InnoGames recently switched to a mobile-only strategy.

4
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:15,683
This means we are heavily using cross-platform engines like Unity instead of rolling our own now.

5
00:00:16,364 --> 00:00:20,168
In my talk titled Data Binding Architectures for Rapid UI Creation in Unity,

6
00:00:20,308 --> 00:00:22,930
I show you how I created the foundation for our new games.

7
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:27,926
I will show you how we allowed our artists to work independently in Unity.

8
00:00:28,426 --> 00:00:32,529
This means they can design, iterate and test all their creations without any help of our

9
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,029
developers.

10
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:36,171
I hope to see you there and show you what we learned along the way.
