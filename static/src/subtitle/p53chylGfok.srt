1
00:00:03,218 --> 00:00:05,741
So, hi everybody, my name is Jesse Vigil.

2
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:08,263
and I will talk about some of those sort of as we go.

3
00:00:08,283 --> 00:00:10,105
a QA team that we by necessity had to put together,

4
00:00:26,441 --> 00:00:32,163
more about how to build a culture of assured quality, as I like to call it.

5
00:00:32,243 --> 00:00:37,124
So even though this is the Education Summit, there might be other people in the room too,

6
00:00:37,144 --> 00:00:43,366
and that's cool, because this honestly can work for anybody who is small, starting out,

7
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:48,508
thinking that maybe they can't afford full QA or don't have the resources to do it sort of properly.

8
00:00:48,868 --> 00:00:53,689
And I say this because our games are increasingly public-facing, and I'm not...

9
00:00:54,109 --> 00:00:57,431
talking just about USC games, although,

10
00:00:57,451 --> 00:00:59,552
I mean, even just recently,

11
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,052
we were in the failing New York Times.

12
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:03,994
So, it's just everybody.

13
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:08,255
In general, the rock stars that we teach

14
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:10,056
who are 20, 21 years old,

15
00:01:10,596 --> 00:01:13,938
are increasingly not waiting even until they graduate

16
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:15,419
before they are starting to take their place

17
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:17,499
in the professional community.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,521
And that means that to a degree,

19
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,222
like since more and more people from the outside

20
00:01:22,675 --> 00:01:28,238
world are putting hands on things, we've realized that we have to start sort of changing to

21
00:01:28,278 --> 00:01:30,620
reflect this reality.

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,524
I spend a lot of my time and sort of my focus in a lot of the teaching that I do is I think

23
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:41,367
basically on straddling the difference between finished and done, which tends to work.

24
00:01:42,147 --> 00:01:45,729
in both directions. I end up with teams that say, well, I implemented my last feature,

25
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:52,933
so I guess I'm done. Or also the reverse, who are the people who say, I know that I

26
00:01:52,953 --> 00:01:56,575
will never be finished. Art is never finished. Only ever shipped.

27
00:01:58,196 --> 00:02:03,199
So we've been making a lot of changes sort of as we go. Even just in our...

28
00:02:04,407 --> 00:02:09,189
intermediate class, we build in more time for dedicated QA and the advanced game project

29
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,789
of which I am the production faculty.

30
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:16,432
There's now a dedicated QA phase and a proper beta that is not two nights before the show.

31
00:02:17,552 --> 00:02:23,455
We've done away with a mid-winter sort of progress show in favor of things that are

32
00:02:23,515 --> 00:02:25,836
actually fully done because we are just brimming with so much.

33
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:30,417
stuff that needs eyes on it, that we're changing the focus.

34
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:34,879
And Sean and I teach a Polish and Publish class that is entirely about

35
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,420
taking things that were made in other classes and

36
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,301
spending another 15 weeks polishing them up and making them public-facing.

37
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:47,467
But sort of the biggest thing that we started doing was USC Games Publishing, which is the

38
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:51,633
first digital press, university press more or less.

39
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:55,377
We're a publisher on PlayStation, we're a publisher on Xbox, we're a publisher on a

40
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:57,060
few other people, I can't say just yet.

41
00:02:58,683 --> 00:03:04,947
But this is sort of the big time, and we've announced our initial sort of slate, but the

42
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:10,531
debut title for the publishing label was going to be a student game that started as a jam

43
00:03:10,972 --> 00:03:17,656
and then had a lot of festival success, won a BAFTA, did more festivals, and then pitched

44
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:22,680
more or less to spend another 16 months as an advanced game project with the Express

45
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,703
purpose of becoming public facing and arriving on a console at the end.

46
00:03:27,003 --> 00:03:27,964
And it went very well.

47
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:33,147
So well in fact that at the end of their show we very confidently announced the date that

48
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:37,731
we had chosen and cleared with the platform, which is July, was it July 26th.

49
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,031
And then...

50
00:03:40,843 --> 00:03:44,045
I realized that I was going to be one of the people who was responsible for that and I

51
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:48,508
had a minor freak out about it because consoles have a lot of rules.

52
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:50,650
Like a lot of rules.

53
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:56,274
And this is a generic stock photo because we're not allowed to show photos of the binders

54
00:03:56,414 --> 00:03:56,574
that...

55
00:03:57,475 --> 00:04:01,978
The consoles give but I'm guessing that there are a lot of people in this room who have seen the real binders and know

56
00:04:02,018 --> 00:04:04,140
That this is almost not an exaggeration

57
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,101
Every console has different requirements

58
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,583
They're each vague and confusing in their own ways

59
00:04:09,084 --> 00:04:15,068
And they kind of require a specialized skill set in order to be certified properly work the way that they're all supposed to that's the inherent

60
00:04:15,108 --> 00:04:16,189
promise behind a console

61
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:22,071
Large publishers maintain dedicated teams devoted to just getting through the technical requirements

62
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:29,394
in part because they can and it's good business, but also because you can incur severe financial penalties

63
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:33,775
and we are talking about like low five figures every time you screw up after your free try

64
00:04:33,855 --> 00:04:38,076
which to a publisher is, somebody's gonna get yelled at into a university, it's like, how much?

65
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:42,618
And I know all of these things because my first job in games was actually in QA

66
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:44,879
so I started at the Vendy Universal Games.

67
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,370
I guess younger and thinner.

68
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,813
That's actually me on Half-Life 2, during the only time we were allowed to work on Half-Life

69
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:54,574
2, which is when there was no one else in the building.

70
00:04:55,214 --> 00:05:01,739
And I started in QA and I moved into requirements and eventually production, so that was sort

71
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,142
of always known when we were mentoring this project and we knew that if we were going

72
00:05:07,162 --> 00:05:09,804
to be serious about this, Chambara was basically going to need...

73
00:05:10,308 --> 00:05:15,292
a proper, like, team of, like, a crack team of commandos, more or less, to QA the hell

74
00:05:15,312 --> 00:05:17,273
out of this thing and make sure that it was going to get there.

75
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:19,775
But we didn't really have that.

76
00:05:20,276 --> 00:05:25,500
And most small teams don't have that at the scale that is probably necessary, especially

77
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,143
when the penalties for being wrong are pretty severe.

78
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:33,847
So how we decided to come about this was to solve the problem like producers and then

79
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:35,288
execute it like educators.

80
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:41,710
We knew by necessity this team was going to be made up mostly of passionate volunteers

81
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,432
who at most we could throw some hourly student worker money at, but for the most part they

82
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:50,213
were going to be there because they wanted the experience, because they wanted to support

83
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:53,774
their friends, because they were excited about doing this brand new thing with us.

84
00:05:55,912 --> 00:06:02,358
So there's a lot of formal training normally to get to sort of requirements level QA knowledge.

85
00:06:02,718 --> 00:06:03,459
We didn't have that.

86
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:06,842
But on the other hand, one thing we had that we didn't have even when I was being trained

87
00:06:06,862 --> 00:06:10,025
at Vivendi was theoretically we're pretty good teachers.

88
00:06:10,085 --> 00:06:14,569
And so we did what we do best is we built a crash course at a curriculum really quickly

89
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,771
based on all the things that we know.

90
00:06:17,908 --> 00:06:22,130
a work about how we teach people and then try to teach them some of these things as

91
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,010
quickly as possible.

92
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,852
But it's important to just sort of know that it doesn't really matter whether they're students

93
00:06:26,912 --> 00:06:30,913
or anything else as far as I'm concerned because one of the things that when I came to this

94
00:06:30,994 --> 00:06:33,735
QA, everybody sort of starts as a passionate amateur.

95
00:06:35,035 --> 00:06:39,417
For a long time, and this has changed a little bit, but it's still basically true, that QA

96
00:06:39,457 --> 00:06:43,999
is full of people who love video games and want to learn more about how to make them

97
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:46,100
and want to work in any capacity that they can.

98
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:49,283
So it's all sort of about onboarding more or less.

99
00:06:49,303 --> 00:06:50,825
This is what our onboarding sort of looks like.

100
00:06:51,105 --> 00:06:56,030
It was a casual meeting of friends more than anything super formal.

101
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:01,576
And the sort of early important soapbox lesson that I'm going to give

102
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:09,004
about this is that our entire industry tends to mock and downplay QA to some degree.

103
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:14,609
And I kind of hate this because it shapes attitudes about the importance of delivering

104
00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:16,771
a quality bug-free experience.

105
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:20,674
When we treat QA like they're not part of the development team, we train developers

106
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:23,357
to think QA is not part of the development process.

107
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:28,099
So I tend to try to frame QA, and I did with this team,

108
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,381
as the last line of defense, more or less.

109
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:33,883
The only people in a critical capacity

110
00:07:33,923 --> 00:07:35,664
who are going to be on the side of the game.

111
00:07:35,704 --> 00:07:37,004
So while it sucks to get feedback

112
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:38,806
that you don't want to hear sometimes,

113
00:07:39,566 --> 00:07:41,047
this is the last time that you're gonna get it

114
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:43,548
from people who are on your side and part of the team.

115
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,410
So I feel really strongly about this,

116
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,371
and I don't put up with that mockery sort of professionally

117
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:49,772
and definitely not in my classroom,

118
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:50,652
and I'm happy to say that.

119
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:56,388
We had a really positive overall culture which formed the seeds of things to follow.

120
00:07:57,751 --> 00:07:59,475
So in the crash course, things we did.

121
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,333
We explained, first of all, that there are different kinds of testing.

122
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:08,938
And while we had spent a lot of time as educators talking about the importance of playtesting,

123
00:08:08,978 --> 00:08:13,722
talking about usability testing, sometimes they only ever heard the testing part of it.

124
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:19,327
So whenever we talked to any of our students and say, hey, have you really tested this

125
00:08:19,347 --> 00:08:19,727
thing for bugs?

126
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:20,628
They're like, oh, yeah, I tested it.

127
00:08:20,648 --> 00:08:22,430
But they just playtested it some more.

128
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,033
I even got an email from some producers just two days ago.

129
00:08:26,784 --> 00:08:30,727
say they were QA testing, but it turns out they were play testing, and they found no

130
00:08:30,787 --> 00:08:31,128
new bugs.

131
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:37,774
So we spent a lot of time just sort of very carefully laying out all the different kinds

132
00:08:38,034 --> 00:08:43,739
and what each one of those things sort of, what they do more or less in order to make

133
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:44,080
it better.

134
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,144
And the best thing that we did was frame it out of the context of game development.

135
00:08:49,184 --> 00:08:50,906
So this actually worked extremely well.

136
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:53,247
I told them, all right, think about it instead of,

137
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:56,088
like, when somebody finds a bug, a crime has been committed.

138
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:58,769
And your job is not to prosecute the guilty,

139
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:02,470
and your job is not even to understand all of the whys.

140
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,331
You guys are the CSI team, more or less.

141
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:07,792
You arrive at the scene, and your job is to gather

142
00:09:07,872 --> 00:09:10,873
as much information and evidence as humanly possible

143
00:09:10,913 --> 00:09:12,454
to turn over to the developers,

144
00:09:13,014 --> 00:09:15,335
who will be able to do the whys,

145
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,215
be the detectives, more or less, and make the fix,

146
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:19,316
and then leave it up to production to prosecute the guilty.

147
00:09:23,114 --> 00:09:24,534
And that worked really, really well.

148
00:09:24,994 --> 00:09:29,956
One thing that I was trying not to do, however, was introduce a lot of complicated jargon,

149
00:09:30,016 --> 00:09:30,577
more or less.

150
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,998
But then it ended up slipping out.

151
00:09:33,018 --> 00:09:37,339
And when I brought in some industry mentors, more or less, old habits flared back up and

152
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:40,701
pretty soon we were having our own conversation about, well, that's a dupe or can you repro

153
00:09:40,721 --> 00:09:40,941
that.

154
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:42,435
I should write a suite for that.

155
00:09:42,475 --> 00:09:45,497
That's a NAB, which is slang for not a bug.

156
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:48,740
But it turned out that using that slang

157
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,941
was an unexpectedly really great thing.

158
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,362
First of all, it professionalized them.

159
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:56,345
It made them feel qualified and vital members of the team.

160
00:09:56,385 --> 00:09:58,807
Just like any time you give any group of people

161
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:01,109
a special secret code to talk in automatically,

162
00:10:01,129 --> 00:10:03,411
you feel cool and important

163
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:06,933
and with some kind of specialized skill set.

164
00:10:07,134 --> 00:10:09,535
So it felt more like being part of an elite team

165
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:11,097
and less like doing menial grunt work.

166
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,882
And it also, I think, prepared them to interact professionally.

167
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:17,163
The students were on Sony DevNet, they were on ID at Xbox,

168
00:10:17,223 --> 00:10:21,304
asking questions of other seasoned developers and our partners directly.

169
00:10:21,904 --> 00:10:26,446
And because they had those words, I think it definitely helped make people feel

170
00:10:26,486 --> 00:10:31,467
a little bit more charitable towards ushering along all of us noobs, more or less.

171
00:10:32,087 --> 00:10:32,567
It also.

172
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:36,628
In hindsight, I thought about what does it mean,

173
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:38,249
like why does jargon exist?

174
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:41,191
And part of it is because it's clear communication,

175
00:10:41,231 --> 00:10:42,652
so there's never any misunderstanding

176
00:10:42,712 --> 00:10:46,114
about a vagary of a word, more or less.

177
00:10:46,174 --> 00:10:47,495
So because we didn't have a lot of time

178
00:10:47,535 --> 00:10:48,816
and we didn't have a lot of formality,

179
00:10:48,876 --> 00:10:51,337
the communications between the QA team

180
00:10:51,377 --> 00:10:53,158
and the developers were very smooth.

181
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,880
Another good thing that we did was,

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,021
I freaked out really early on

183
00:10:57,081 --> 00:10:59,262
and I called my old buddy from QA.

184
00:10:59,362 --> 00:11:01,043
So in 2003, that's him on the left.

185
00:11:01,592 --> 00:11:03,332
and also there he is in 2016.

186
00:11:04,133 --> 00:11:05,774
Tom doesn't look that different.

187
00:11:06,354 --> 00:11:07,635
Neither of these photos are at work either.

188
00:11:07,675 --> 00:11:09,295
It's just like him at a restaurant and him in a kitchen.

189
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,756
We could never take any photos at work.

190
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:11,456
This is what we have.

191
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:15,058
But yeah, so Tom is now the head of Konami QA.

192
00:11:15,118 --> 00:11:16,179
And so I called him up and I said,

193
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:17,880
we're going on console.

194
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,780
And Tom said, when?

195
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,580
I said, July.

196
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:22,282
And he went, no, that's not, no, you're not.

197
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:24,563
And I said, no, we seriously are.

198
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,263
We told the world.

199
00:11:25,323 --> 00:11:26,684
And so Tom very graciously.

200
00:11:27,957 --> 00:11:31,078
helped out and reminded me because I had not done a console

201
00:11:31,378 --> 00:11:32,498
in this generation.

202
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:33,738
My last one was PS3.

203
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:37,379
So Tom and I wrote basically a course reader,

204
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:40,040
but a manual based on what we remembered

205
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,381
from our old Vivendi training manuals,

206
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:43,241
what worked and what didn't,

207
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:45,801
and a lot of sort of practical knowledge

208
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:48,182
that Tom picked up when he trains new hires at Konami.

209
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,523
The thing that we did was these manuals

210
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,143
are also just as thick and dense

211
00:11:52,183 --> 00:11:53,603
as the ones that were responsible

212
00:11:53,703 --> 00:11:55,664
for servicing with the consoles.

213
00:11:56,204 --> 00:12:00,127
And Tom and I both had a moment where we were like, oh yeah, I didn't read that very carefully either.

214
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:05,491
So we stripped a lot of that out and kept all the high-level philosophy, more or less,

215
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:09,513
and pulled a lot of the technical stuff onto sort of a case-by-case,

216
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:12,495
oh, now we need to know that, let's put that in there so that we don't overwhelm people.

217
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:17,170
Like here's some examples of some of the stuff that were in the book.

218
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,190
We talked about how to play sub-optimally.

219
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,331
The goal is no longer to win the game or beat the level.

220
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:24,933
Your goal is to find everything there is to know about the level, to know it better.

221
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:27,874
Be a cartographer. Have you seen every corner of the game?

222
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:30,315
Have you fallen in every pit? Have you climbed in every wall?

223
00:12:30,775 --> 00:12:33,516
I told a story about when I was on Lord of the Rings Online

224
00:12:33,616 --> 00:12:36,017
and I walked into every tree in Mirkwood one week.

225
00:12:37,681 --> 00:12:39,443
Play counter to the designers intentions.

226
00:12:39,823 --> 00:12:43,027
If the designers want you to be able to unlock a door with a key,

227
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:46,211
then your job today QA is to get through that door without a key.

228
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:48,754
Figure it out. Do it. Break the game. That's your job.

229
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,753
We also built some sort of like rapid knowledge dump,

230
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:57,315
Neo, the matrix level, just pour as much as we could

231
00:12:57,355 --> 00:12:58,535
into their heads, PowerPoints.

232
00:12:58,876 --> 00:13:00,136
These are some of the best slides.

233
00:13:00,977 --> 00:13:02,678
This by far is the most effective slide

234
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,598
in that entire talk.

235
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:07,300
I stress over and over that developers are poor QA testers

236
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,961
unless they have superhuman discipline

237
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:11,723
because they know how their game is supposed to be played

238
00:13:11,783 --> 00:13:14,144
and they, on some subconscious level,

239
00:13:14,304 --> 00:13:16,726
always want it to work and will avoid things

240
00:13:16,806 --> 00:13:20,148
that their brain, even subconsciously knows doesn't work.

241
00:13:20,908 --> 00:13:25,050
This is also true of their friends and peers who are often good at games and understand what a game is trying to do

242
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:32,214
But I remind them that the majority of their end users are not those people and they are the ones who will find a problem

243
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:37,357
They are the ones who will be unhappy and they are the ones that ultimately you are trying to service

244
00:13:37,697 --> 00:13:41,179
So it might be slightly hyperbolic, but it really drove the point home

245
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:46,862
And now that I have a toddler who grabbed my controller, I actually found like two super cool bugs recently

246
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:49,003
So maybe it's not even that hyperbolic

247
00:13:49,832 --> 00:13:55,502
We did go over some formal stuff so that we could run as much like a professional team as possible.

248
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:58,466
This also helped us when we were talking to mentors.

249
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:02,914
So we wrote a bug just the way that you would professionally with all the pieces.

250
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:09,280
We did not invest at the time in a formal bug tracking system, although I think that's

251
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,081
sort of an improve on my part.

252
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:15,383
We learned, I think, the upper limits of Google Foo during this process, but since we were

253
00:14:15,403 --> 00:14:21,325
a new publisher and we hadn't really decided on all of our techs just yet, this was a pretty

254
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:21,806
good trick.

255
00:14:22,646 --> 00:14:27,028
But one thing that we did was we built a lot of on-rails experiences for inexperienced

256
00:14:27,088 --> 00:14:27,688
QA people.

257
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:30,955
Which are very similar to professional QA test suites,

258
00:14:31,075 --> 00:14:33,838
but with a few extra sort of interactive tricks.

259
00:14:33,938 --> 00:14:35,259
Do this, did it work?

260
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,861
Yes, do this then.

261
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:37,422
Did it work?

262
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:38,683
Yes, do this.

263
00:14:39,084 --> 00:14:39,744
That did not work?

264
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,526
Okay, stop everything, write a bug right now.

265
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:42,207
Here's the form.

266
00:14:43,248 --> 00:14:45,511
Now you may click here to go back and keep going.

267
00:14:46,864 --> 00:14:51,948
After a while, we didn't have to do that too long before they just started using the forms on their own and everything was cool.

268
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:56,211
We also tried to make some games out of it when we did. I invented a PowerPoint game

269
00:14:56,311 --> 00:14:58,813
that's like a game show called Name That Severity where we all yell,

270
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:05,557
we look at bugs and then we all yell how severe we think they are on a scale of 1 or A to

271
00:15:06,098 --> 00:15:11,462
C or 3, like a minor graphical kind of issue. I pulled things that I found personally.

272
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:14,805
or other really great sort of things.

273
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:17,228
And we sort of talked through each of them.

274
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:19,370
And even some of the edge cases, too,

275
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,372
judgment calls and emphasizing the severity

276
00:15:21,412 --> 00:15:24,576
because it becomes a key part of triaging.

277
00:15:25,097 --> 00:15:27,019
So bugs like this, and we were all,

278
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:28,140
Firewatch was new at the time,

279
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,081
we were all playing Firewatch,

280
00:15:29,101 --> 00:15:30,583
so a lot of our bugs were about Firewatch.

281
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:37,712
These sorts of things where yeah, technically the game didn't crash, but the rope is attached like basically perpetually at this point

282
00:15:37,752 --> 00:15:38,713
It definitely makes things

283
00:15:39,274 --> 00:15:42,098
Complicated and later in the game you can't do anything so

284
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:47,477
It's even though it doesn't seem like a crash. It's as bad as a crash, and this is important because

285
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:49,738
coming to terms with triage

286
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:54,820
Keeping the notion that triage is coming early at the foreground kept everything constructive

287
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:58,602
I think on some level we knew that we were going to let some things go at the end of the day

288
00:15:58,982 --> 00:16:03,624
but reminding ourselves that we were going to be having those conversations early helped when it came to

289
00:16:04,024 --> 00:16:09,209
Well, how many hours did we spend fixing a C bug when there were 12 A bugs still in the system?

290
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:12,613
How many hours does QA have left? How can they best be deployed?

291
00:16:13,153 --> 00:16:19,820
And make sure that they're using their time well also, because sometimes, again Firewatch...

292
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,643
It was helpful to explain enhancements also, which are,

293
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:27,606
I, professionally, we always use D for enhancement.

294
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:30,768
Things that are working the way that the developers

295
00:16:30,808 --> 00:16:33,010
intend to work, but maybe QA has a different opinion

296
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,311
of a way things could work better.

297
00:16:35,092 --> 00:16:39,736
Sometimes, inexperienced teams flood the bug system

298
00:16:39,796 --> 00:16:41,517
with feedback instead of bugs.

299
00:16:42,158 --> 00:16:44,079
So, we spent a while talking about.

300
00:16:45,478 --> 00:16:50,424
The difference between feedback and bug hunting and making sure that those were in the proper proportion.

301
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:54,369
And all of this worked out really well because, and I've been hinting at this a few times,

302
00:16:54,809 --> 00:16:57,433
the most important thing we did was the culture.

303
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:07,172
Overall, the environment that we were building ended up being the lasting legacy more than

304
00:17:07,352 --> 00:17:11,593
any of the hard and fast rote rules that we ended up teaching.

305
00:17:12,013 --> 00:17:17,856
The relationship dynamics turned out to be the real factor in that team's stunning effectiveness.

306
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:26,919
The QA students became better collaborators after the summer because of the sort of team-based nature of being in the trenches in that tiny room that didn't even have air conditioning sometimes.

307
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:30,761
And there was also no substitute for practice.

308
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:38,403
So the more time that they spent with games, they even started testing other games as hard as they were testing the one that they were being paid to test.

309
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:47,032
And it really sort of built them into people who thought critically, but were able to communicate

310
00:17:47,092 --> 00:17:48,093
constructively.

311
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:53,175
And that ended up being a meta-conversation that wasn't formalized or anything about,

312
00:17:53,275 --> 00:17:55,656
but I'm already sort of seeing a vague sort of culture shift.

313
00:17:56,056 --> 00:18:01,060
But the one thing that I do have to say that we were not able to streamline is I think

314
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,044
the best on a university level, the best equivalent is sort of dedicated lab time.

315
00:18:05,144 --> 00:18:08,086
But we learned that they were minimally effective.

316
00:18:10,028 --> 00:18:14,071
All of these lessons were not effective when we introduced them as part of like a subclass

317
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:14,632
more or less.

318
00:18:15,592 --> 00:18:20,096
Only the dedicated time and large blocks of two to four hours to actually do the testing

319
00:18:20,176 --> 00:18:21,998
was where we started to see some real.

320
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:30,025
Results, I think there's something about just that amount of time and that closeness with the material that really starts to sort of cement some

321
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:37,548
Of the broader cultural messages. Other unexpected result to use a bug term. We ended up with more mindful developers

322
00:18:38,729 --> 00:18:44,191
Veterans of that summer crash course team have become more thoughtful and far-thinking in their practice as developers

323
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:48,473
They recognize bugs in their own work and know better practices for how to solve them

324
00:18:48,803 --> 00:18:51,085
They give better feedback to their fellow designers,

325
00:18:51,726 --> 00:18:53,547
and they manage tasks and deadlines better.

326
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,429
And I will say that the Chimbara developers

327
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:58,330
became more thoughtful and professional

328
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,772
for putting their game through a formal QA process.

329
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:04,254
I think they have all become a lot more respectful

330
00:19:04,274 --> 00:19:06,596
of the process, better at taking feedback,

331
00:19:06,656 --> 00:19:09,738
and more deliberate in some of the decisions that they make.

332
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:13,319
So then we shipped it, and here we are at E3,

333
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,942
which is the proudest I've been of any title

334
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:17,084
I've ever taken to E3.

335
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:20,708
And that is my 19-year-old Sony Requirements lead

336
00:19:20,928 --> 00:19:23,371
with the lead designer in this photo.

337
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:25,073
It was a really happy day.

338
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:27,216
We still had another month of development

339
00:19:28,257 --> 00:19:30,399
and fixes ahead of us when this photo was taken.

340
00:19:32,853 --> 00:19:37,896
It was a struggle. I'll say that it was not easy. Without about three vital students who

341
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:42,298
really threw themselves into requirements and two dedicated faculty acting as producers,

342
00:19:42,938 --> 00:19:47,860
we would not have made our real estate. And navigating all those procedures and all the

343
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,402
rules and things would not have been possible without advisement from Tom and some of our

344
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:56,824
partners at Sony and Microsoft. I'm going to say thank you guys so much, just in case

345
00:19:56,844 --> 00:19:57,925
you're ever watching on the vault.

346
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:02,390
And it's worth mentioning that before entering formal QA,

347
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:07,317
the developers had worked on this thing for about 18 months prior to us getting involved.

348
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:09,921
There's a lot of work into this. This wasn't just us deciding,

349
00:20:09,981 --> 00:20:11,844
oh, I think it's time to put a game on a console.

350
00:20:13,266 --> 00:20:15,169
In hindsight, I think there was a point maybe...

351
00:20:15,855 --> 00:20:20,160
early July, where we would say why did we decide to go on a console? This is the worst

352
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,905
idea we've ever had. The constraints ended up being super useful though, and if I had

353
00:20:24,925 --> 00:20:28,428
it to do all over again I would do it exactly the same way, even though there was a little

354
00:20:28,448 --> 00:20:30,190
bit of heartbreak along the way.

355
00:20:31,811 --> 00:20:35,213
Even just the differences between working on PlayStation and Xbox, which is coming,

356
00:20:36,474 --> 00:20:40,216
highlighted some, and I know there's at least one developer in the room because I just saw him,

357
00:20:40,576 --> 00:20:42,397
lazy and suboptimal engineering.

358
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:46,819
There was an over-reliance on plugins that finally had a real-world consequence

359
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:50,741
that became, I think, a really powerful lesson when it almost prevented...

360
00:20:51,602 --> 00:20:52,703
submission from going through.

361
00:20:52,723 --> 00:20:55,604
And it was nice to have an external keeper of standards.

362
00:20:55,985 --> 00:20:57,185
We can say all of these things,

363
00:20:57,445 --> 00:21:00,527
but it was nice to have like Big Bad Sony and Microsoft

364
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:03,889
also saying no, it will absolutely not go on the console

365
00:21:03,949 --> 00:21:06,150
unless these things are adhered to,

366
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,852
that I think finally drove home

367
00:21:08,932 --> 00:21:11,714
some really important lessons at the end of the day.

368
00:21:12,574 --> 00:21:14,595
Also, the entire team has like a really vital

369
00:21:14,635 --> 00:21:17,417
hireable experience now, so I wouldn't trade that either.

370
00:21:18,531 --> 00:21:23,014
If you are going to go down this road and undertake some of this insanity, here are

371
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:24,955
the best things that we learned so far.

372
00:21:26,456 --> 00:21:30,019
Make it part of your practice in every class, even if it's just a mention.

373
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,381
Like I said, I feel it's important to talk about this as part of the process.

374
00:21:36,186 --> 00:21:40,550
done when we get right up to the point where we're fixing bugs, we have in fact just sort of begun.

375
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:47,577
Having a dedicated class or a summer workshop was a big leap forward. That time together to

376
00:21:47,617 --> 00:21:51,541
focus on nothing but this paid off in spades. I don't know if we're going to have to do that

377
00:21:51,581 --> 00:21:55,665
every single time to be perfectly honest, even if we get new people, because the seeds of

378
00:21:56,712 --> 00:22:01,374
What we learned and how we conduct ourselves and how we think about things and help each

379
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:07,777
other just as sort of a large developer more or less or a publisher across the entire university

380
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:14,780
program have already sort of been shown and we're already starting to see that the student

381
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,062
teams that are working on things for this year or for even the year after that are

382
00:22:19,942 --> 00:22:24,307
are internalizing a lot of these lessons and applying them themselves when they in turn

383
00:22:24,347 --> 00:22:27,150
become leaders and set up their own teams and their own cultures.

384
00:22:27,991 --> 00:22:32,196
I think it works best with practical, real software and goals rather than talking about

385
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:34,579
this entirely in theory like I'm doing right now.

386
00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:35,360
Works 100% better when...

387
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:40,335
We have foolishly told the world that something is going to happen on a specific date.

388
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:44,519
And also, it's really, really important to celebrate those successes.

389
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,325
I've mentioned this at the beginning, but making QA feel like part of the whole team

390
00:22:50,365 --> 00:22:52,507
and also a vital and special part of it.

391
00:22:54,293 --> 00:22:58,820
made a huge difference, I think, in terms of those critical points,

392
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,426
since we couldn't necessarily even pay overtime,

393
00:23:02,686 --> 00:23:08,295
like a traditional publisher will dump on QA to stay all night or do all those sorts of things.

394
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:13,917
being part of the family and being part of the team and celebrating them when they did

395
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:19,378
something right was what got them, got the developers through at the end of the day.

396
00:23:19,918 --> 00:23:24,879
Giving them lots of scaffolding at the beginning is super good. Writing those guides, giving

397
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:29,581
examples, writing sample test suites, doing a couple of bug reports at the beginning for an

398
00:23:29,621 --> 00:23:32,621
inexperienced team so that they have something to follow.

399
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:34,662
It goes a long way.

400
00:23:34,762 --> 00:23:35,822
They'll pick it up pretty quickly.

401
00:23:36,143 --> 00:23:38,203
And then this one, anecdotes are key.

402
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:41,925
Get them, share them, make them a core part of your teaching.

403
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:43,906
Tom and I, at the beginning, were

404
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:46,567
worried that we were telling too many war stories and just

405
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:48,527
funny stories about some of the things that

406
00:23:48,787 --> 00:23:49,868
happened to us in QA.

407
00:23:50,148 --> 00:23:52,029
But it turned out to be those are the lessons

408
00:23:52,149 --> 00:23:55,470
that people remembered and stuck with and did something

409
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,510
with moving forward.

410
00:23:58,793 --> 00:24:04,409
If you don't have some of your own, but you probably do, get a few more and build that into it.

411
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:07,571
The sort of core teaching I think is that

412
00:24:08,272 --> 00:24:10,813
there's a big difference between hiring bug hunters

413
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:13,214
and building sort of an overall culture.

414
00:24:13,715 --> 00:24:15,576
We did not set out to do that,

415
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:18,917
but when we figured out what was happening,

416
00:24:20,338 --> 00:24:22,899
we leaned on the till pretty hard to get to that direction

417
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:25,301
and it's been paying sort of lasting dividends.

418
00:24:26,061 --> 00:24:29,603
Chimbara in fact passed Sony FQA on the first try

419
00:24:29,663 --> 00:24:30,924
with zero issues.

420
00:24:30,964 --> 00:24:31,604
There's normally

421
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:37,668
a tab that has a list for issues, but that tab doesn't appear apparently if there are no issues, which I'd never seen before.

422
00:24:38,088 --> 00:24:43,432
We thought that there was a bug and that we were going to get that report later, and they were like, no, stop asking questions.

423
00:24:43,492 --> 00:24:44,873
It's fine. There's nothing wrong with it.

424
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:51,437
So that was a huge win. Tom and I high-fived over that one. Note the release on the TSN store, July 26th,

425
00:24:51,497 --> 00:24:52,578
exactly the day that we said.

426
00:24:53,838 --> 00:24:54,699
We feel really proud of that.

427
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:57,560
But also, the veterans on this year's teams

428
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,101
are turning out significantly more stable and complete

429
00:25:00,121 --> 00:25:02,142
software at the halfway mark than previous years.

430
00:25:02,222 --> 00:25:04,903
I feel like it is partially due to example

431
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,023
and partially due to training.

432
00:25:07,203 --> 00:25:08,304
And there's just this, like I said,

433
00:25:08,344 --> 00:25:10,725
this culture of assured quality experience for players

434
00:25:10,785 --> 00:25:11,905
that is starting to spread.

435
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:17,330
And we're seeing this in the things that are stepped up

436
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,151
to take that next spot.

437
00:25:20,272 --> 00:25:24,114
This entire talk was about 14 years in the making,

438
00:25:24,195 --> 00:25:26,176
crossing those photographs.

439
00:25:26,416 --> 00:25:27,397
We're still learning things.

440
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:29,498
I hope this was helpful.

441
00:25:30,199 --> 00:25:32,300
Thanks a whole bunch.

442
00:25:33,481 --> 00:25:35,242
And I can take a question, I think, or two

443
00:25:35,282 --> 00:25:38,624
before I have to wander towards the room,

444
00:25:38,724 --> 00:25:40,926
or the place outside where I will keep talking,

445
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:42,547
if anybody's got anything.
