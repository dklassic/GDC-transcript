00:00:05,613 --> 00:00:10,757
Hello. My name is Jonathan Banks. I'm an environment artist with Telltale Games. Thank you all

2
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:14,080
very much for coming to this session today. I just wanted to remind a few of you right

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,183
now that we don't want to record anything, and also to fill out your evaluations after

4
00:00:18,223 --> 00:00:23,428
this. That would be great. So, I work for Telltale Games. I've been there for about

5
00:00:23,488 --> 00:00:27,071
four years now, and I help define the visual art style for The Walking Dead.

6
00:00:34,457 --> 00:00:36,279
for the Mature franchise.

7
00:00:36,919 --> 00:00:39,401
So how many of you have played the Walking Dead game so far?

8
00:00:40,282 --> 00:00:40,602
Awesome.

9
00:00:41,263 --> 00:00:41,723
Very cool.

10
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:46,007
For those of you who haven't, I'm going to start by showing a trailer that showcases

11
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,428
the visual art style we achieved.

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,171
Rated M for Mature.

13
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:54,814
Message one.

14
00:00:55,194 --> 00:00:56,175
Oh my god, finally.

15
00:00:56,195 --> 00:00:58,337
I don't know if you tried to reach us.

16
00:00:58,617 --> 00:00:59,898
All the calls are getting dropped.

17
00:01:14,473 --> 00:01:16,154
I want my parents to come home now.

18
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:27,460
I think that might be a little while.

19
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,060
He's bitten!

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,040
We gotta throw him out!

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,241
I'm gonna kill him, Kat!

22
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:31,842
You wanna get violent, you old fuck?

23
00:01:32,022 --> 00:01:32,802
Well, come on!

24
00:01:32,822 --> 00:01:38,225
I don't know who you are or what you did, but you better become a better liar.

25
00:01:47,984 --> 00:01:51,907
All right. So today I'm going to be talking about the art of The Walking Dead and the

26
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:57,891
approach we at Telltale took to make it happen. The Walking Dead IP is about survivors living

27
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:02,934
in the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse. It's originally a comic created by Robert Kirkman

28
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:09,259
with illustrated works by Tony Moore and Charlie Adlard. Telltale's The Walking Dead is based

29
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:10,320
on the comic book universe.

30
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:17,052
So typically, most post-apocalyptic games on the market are gritty and realistic.

31
00:02:17,752 --> 00:02:21,416
If you look up zombie game or zombie apocalypse online, you get something like this.

32
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:25,560
With the exception of Plants vs. Zombies, it all looks pretty much the same.

33
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:29,665
The imagery is bleak, desaturated, and muted.

34
00:02:32,163 --> 00:02:37,444
Before The Walking Dead, Telltale is a company best known for comical, lighthearted adventure

35
00:02:37,484 --> 00:02:43,406
games such as Tales of Monkey Island, Sam & Max, Puzzle Agent, and Back to the Future.

36
00:02:44,627 --> 00:02:51,489
So going from games like these to The Walking Dead was a difficult task. So how did we do

37
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:54,190
it? Pre-production.

38
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:58,960
The general consensus during pre-production was that we wanted to create a unique-looking

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,322
game that was familiar to the comics, but also had that strong illustrated style seen

40
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:04,382
in most telltale titles.

41
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:11,086
Looking at the comic, we were inspired by its bold compositions and classic comic book

42
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:11,586
art style.

43
00:03:12,386 --> 00:03:16,829
We really felt that the hand-painted textures and stylistic lighting would be a really good

44
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:17,829
fit for this franchise.

45
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,431
Inspired, a few quick concepts were made.

46
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:29,454
These were some of the only concepts made during pre-production.

47
00:03:33,956 --> 00:03:38,159
To move the production forward, we decided to create a 3D environment based on one of

48
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:38,859
these concepts.

49
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,322
We used the morgue concept as seen here because it visually represented what we were looking

50
00:03:43,362 --> 00:03:45,203
to achieve and was the most graphic.

51
00:03:46,003 --> 00:03:47,024
The end result was this.

52
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:53,318
This art stayed true to the illustrated concept,

53
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:55,179
drew inspiration from the comic,

54
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,200
and worked well within the Telltale engine.

55
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:03,182
This art inspired the team and excited the company.

56
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,303
Most importantly, it moved the production forward.

57
00:04:08,424 --> 00:04:11,205
At the time, I was working on Jurassic Park and Puzzle Agent,

58
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:12,906
so I did a lot of this during my lunch break.

59
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:22,179
And this is one of the first pieces of art that was created for the game.

60
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:30,162
The fundamental techniques that were used to create the environment art were then passed

61
00:04:30,222 --> 00:04:32,683
on to the character department in order to create our first zombie.

62
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:37,786
Sharing and evolving the artistic process utilized by both the character and environment

63
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:41,107
art allowed us to create a cohesive world that fully immersed the player.

64
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:42,788
This was really important to me.

65
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,390
I really wanted all assets to really seamlessly fit together.

66
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:51,877
After showing this work to Robert Kirkman, he was super enthusiastic with what we were doing, and excited.

67
00:04:53,438 --> 00:04:58,119
With a few assets to work with, our Cinematics and Design department put together the following prototype.

68
00:05:05,301 --> 00:05:10,922
Someone else is here? Thank God. You didn't leave them to us, did you?

69
00:05:11,302 --> 00:05:13,163
No. No, I don't think so.

70
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,691
Look, we need help here. She's having a baby.

71
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:18,892
Wait a minute. Where'd you come from?

72
00:05:21,534 --> 00:05:22,874
I was looking for medical supplies.

73
00:05:23,655 --> 00:05:25,395
This guy in my camp, he...

74
00:05:25,535 --> 00:05:26,356
Shit! Behind you!

75
00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:40,702
Maybe they didn't hear that.

76
00:05:41,686 --> 00:05:46,527
So I hope one day you'll be able to see that whole prototype in its entirety without it

77
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:49,527
being cut down. But one thing we learned from that was that

78
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:52,408
we could tell a mature and engaging story with stylized art.

79
00:05:52,888 --> 00:05:56,129
We also learned that the environments and the characters fit cohesively together.

80
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:04,990
The art process. Every major element in the game started with

81
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,211
a concept. This included both character art and environment

82
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:09,411
art.

83
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:14,033
These illustrated works would then be translated into 3D.

84
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:19,318
So you can really see how true we stayed to these concepts.

85
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:21,099
We really tried to recreate what we saw.

86
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,402
This was the first screenshot we ended up sending out to the public.

87
00:06:26,243 --> 00:06:28,865
It was during Comic-Con, and I was a little bit nervous at first.

88
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:31,267
I wasn't too sure how the public was going to respond to this.

89
00:06:31,828 --> 00:06:33,129
But it was insanely positive.

90
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:35,370
In fact, I didn't see one negative comment.

91
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:37,492
The only thing I saw was people started complaining about

92
00:06:37,592 --> 00:06:39,474
the banner ads that had surrounded the articles.

93
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:43,997
So this positive response is really inspiring to us.

94
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,100
We knew we had created a unique and beautiful world that got

95
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,821
people excited and wanting to see more.

96
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:53,245
In some cases, there really just wasn't time for a

97
00:06:53,285 --> 00:06:55,827
concept, so we looked to the comic for inspiration.

98
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:59,010
Herschel's Farm was an example of an environment that we did

99
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,391
not get a concept for at first.

100
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:03,293
So we looked to the comic.

101
00:07:03,934 --> 00:07:07,236
This is a scan from the comic, and you can see how it was

102
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:07,897
recreated in 3D.

103
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:11,539
Stayed really true.

104
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,682
And even though we didn't have a concept at first for this environment,

105
00:07:17,402 --> 00:07:19,184
we still were able to create something really beautiful.

106
00:07:22,366 --> 00:07:24,087
Breaking down the art further,

107
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:26,628
the following techniques provided solutions

108
00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:28,850
for visually striking real-time art.

109
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,091
These included handcrafted line work,

110
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:34,213
colorful textures, and atmospheric lighting.

111
00:07:37,095 --> 00:07:37,916
Handcrafted line work.

112
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:45,155
Working on the Puzzle Agent series, and having developed the 2D techniques used to create

113
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:49,397
Graham Animals' unique style in 3D, I wanted to take a similar approach to the art creation

114
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:53,458
for The Walking Dead. In Puzzle Agent, all line work was painted

115
00:07:53,498 --> 00:07:56,079
directly onto textures and then applied to models.

116
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,461
No procedural techniques were used. So this was all done in 3D.

117
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:05,083
And looking at what we learned from this, we were able to apply it to The Walking Dead.

118
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:10,685
So as you can see here, the line work was painted directly onto the models.

119
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:16,330
And I hope these turntables really show you what handcrafted line work looks like.

120
00:08:21,054 --> 00:08:24,877
We kept our line work loose because it more closely resembled that of the comic and could

121
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:29,982
be easily adapted by all artists in the studio. So this is how it's applied to characters.

122
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:34,826
And you can see how it's also applied to environments as well.

123
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:43,129
Later into production, we got a new shader that showed what procedural line work and

124
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:43,890
shading looked like.

125
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:48,474
However, it felt too computerized and took away from the player being completely immersed

126
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:49,615
in the Walking Dead universe.

127
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,797
Therefore, we decided not to use it.

128
00:08:53,558 --> 00:08:55,399
Now, I thought that was a really good approach.

129
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,143
But lately, we've actually had a little bit of time to experiment.

130
00:09:00,183 --> 00:09:02,204
We took basically the best of The Walking Dead,

131
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:04,226
and we took our procedural shader,

132
00:09:04,686 --> 00:09:07,228
and you can see right here, we just released this yesterday.

133
00:09:07,608 --> 00:09:09,370
This is our new franchise that we're developing.

134
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,152
And the reason I'm showing this is because everything we do at Telltale

135
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:15,514
is really an evolution of what we've learned from our past products.

136
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:19,436
So, working on various projects like Puzzle Agent and Jurassic Park,

137
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,496
really learned a lot about the art style for that.

138
00:09:22,556 --> 00:09:24,117
That was also applied to The Walking Dead.

139
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:25,577
And you can see where we're taking it now.

140
00:09:27,178 --> 00:09:27,838
But that's the future.

141
00:09:29,298 --> 00:09:30,058
Colorful textures.

142
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:34,259
Unlike the flat colors in Puzzle Agent,

143
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,760
The Walking Dead really needed to have another dimension to its palette.

144
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:39,941
So as you can see from these textures,

145
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:42,101
there's an incredible amount of saturation and detail.

146
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,460
There's also what I'd like to call crafted imperfection

147
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,201
into each one of these textures.

148
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:49,922
And that's really because The Walking Dead deals with

149
00:09:50,342 --> 00:09:52,723
imperfect characters, with imperfect paths,

150
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:54,764
placed in imperfect situations.

151
00:09:55,384 --> 00:09:57,405
So we wanted to reflect a little bit of that in our textures.

152
00:09:59,345 --> 00:10:01,626
You can see how it's applied to one-offs and also characters.

153
00:10:05,748 --> 00:10:07,568
So breaking down some of these textures even further,

154
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:09,929
you can see first we used illustrative techniques

155
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:11,590
to really define highlights and shadows.

156
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:19,622
We kept this very loose. Then we would add color variation by overlaying watercolor textures

157
00:10:19,803 --> 00:10:23,985
or just painting this directly into the maps. And then, of course, adding line work.

158
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:30,688
As you can see, when it all comes together in an in-game screenshot, it really helped

159
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:34,950
our model shine. Atmospheric lighting.

160
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:41,113
So one of the most important techniques that glued the entire canvas together was atmospheric

161
00:10:41,133 --> 00:10:41,413
lighting.

162
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:46,695
Using the cinematic lighting techniques we learned in making Jurassic Park, we pushed

163
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:48,115
it even further with The Walking Dead.

164
00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:52,536
Really Jurassic Park was the first game where we explored cinematic drama.

165
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:55,617
And we took what we learned from that and applied it to The Walking Dead.

166
00:10:56,797 --> 00:11:01,358
So as you can see here, there's an incredible amount of mood and atmosphere with the lighting.

167
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:06,159
We have bold use of silhouettes that really give our lighting a noir look to it.

168
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:08,640
There's a lot of high contrast in here.

169
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,541
You can see how it's applied to some of our other scenes.

170
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:16,807
Really lighting where we wanted the player to focus their attention.

171
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,992
So we wanted every game, every scene in the game to be unique.

172
00:11:25,073 --> 00:11:29,016
Therefore, we created color-keyed concept art that could be effectively translated by

173
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:29,856
our 3D artists.

174
00:11:30,617 --> 00:11:34,519
This was also a really great way to see where an episode was progressing through color.

175
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:40,744
As you can see, if you take one of these color scripts and blow it up, you get something

176
00:11:40,764 --> 00:11:41,104
like this.

177
00:11:43,263 --> 00:11:45,245
And now you can see how it would be translated in 3D.

178
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:52,331
You can see how close we came to reproducing some of these color keys.

179
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:58,816
So breaking down a few of these scenes even further, this is just a scene with models

180
00:11:58,836 --> 00:12:04,020
and textures. Then we would light it based on color key

181
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,223
concept art. You can really see just what lighting does

182
00:12:07,263 --> 00:12:10,525
to a scene. There's an incredible amount of mood already.

183
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:15,717
And then once After Effects and Final Art Direction were involved.

184
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:20,440
So we didn't have too much After Effects to work with.

185
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,584
Basically what you're seeing here is the addition of depth fog and a color overlay to help basically

186
00:12:26,164 --> 00:12:30,747
pull together some of the colors. We also had, used alpha flats in order to

187
00:12:31,007 --> 00:12:36,331
showcase glows or light beams. And here's the motor in, just models and

188
00:12:36,351 --> 00:12:39,273
textures. Once it's lit.

189
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:43,625
And then with After Effects and Final Art Direction.

190
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:48,688
And one of my favorite scenes, St. John's Dairy.

191
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:51,709
In some cases, you can see some of these textures are gray.

192
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,992
We ended up colorizing them in the engine with lighting.

193
00:13:00,354 --> 00:13:02,936
And then with fog, After Effects, and Final Art Direction.

194
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:06,238
So you can see there's a tremendous amount of mood and atmosphere

195
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:09,040
that we were able to put into our scenes just with lighting.

196
00:13:12,538 --> 00:13:13,379
Technical constraints.

197
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,162
So in order to ship on a wide range of platforms,

198
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:20,304
the following technical limitations were imposed.

199
00:13:21,245 --> 00:13:23,446
Environments had a modeling budget of 30,000 verts.

200
00:13:24,407 --> 00:13:26,308
This was so we could add more characters on screen.

201
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:29,250
A big part of The Walking Dead is the characters,

202
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,612
but we didn't want the environments to be bare flat.

203
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,654
So basically what we did is we resorted

204
00:13:34,694 --> 00:13:36,235
to low polygon modeling techniques

205
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:38,717
and used camera-facing flats where appropriate.

206
00:13:40,213 --> 00:13:42,475
At first, we had screen-based ambient occlusion,

207
00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,477
but that was removed, so we ended up baking that into the lightmaps.

208
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:48,959
Vertex lighting replaced perpixel lighting.

209
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,922
As I went over earlier, we had limited post-processing effects.

210
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:55,223
HDR was removed.

211
00:13:56,124 --> 00:13:57,745
And we had reduced lightmap sizes.

212
00:13:58,365 --> 00:14:01,347
This was the big—this, I think, had the biggest impact on the game.

213
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:03,589
Basically, we had a new compression algorithm,

214
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,331
and our lightmaps basically went from being very sharp and graphic

215
00:14:08,372 --> 00:14:09,193
to a little bit soft.

216
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:11,627
However, we didn't let this get to us.

217
00:14:11,987 --> 00:14:14,748
We really just focused on what, with the resources we had,

218
00:14:14,768 --> 00:14:17,390
and we were still able to create some really beautiful art.

219
00:14:18,411 --> 00:14:21,552
This was further, we had our first play test,

220
00:14:21,973 --> 00:14:23,994
and the art received basically some of the highest scores.

221
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:27,516
Production.

222
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,819
So we ended up creating these style guides

223
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:36,661
in order to keep the art consistent and production efficient.

224
00:14:37,349 --> 00:14:40,230
This is really a great way to provide new artists tutorials

225
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,091
on how to adapt to the art style.

226
00:14:43,572 --> 00:14:45,552
And within these tutorials, it showed how...

227
00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:48,153
Within these style guides, it showed how to create textures,

228
00:14:48,693 --> 00:14:49,914
outline modeling constraints,

229
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:53,035
and include brushes that can basically be easily shared

230
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:54,736
throughout the entire art department.

231
00:14:57,357 --> 00:15:00,298
In some cases, there were some tutorials

232
00:15:00,338 --> 00:15:03,759
that basically showed how to create assets very quickly.

233
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:05,920
You could use this train as an example right here.

234
00:15:06,968 --> 00:15:09,749
Once it was modeled, line work could be easily applied to it,

235
00:15:10,349 --> 00:15:11,850
and then we could throw on a few base textures

236
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,591
and move it down through the production pipeline.

237
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:15,892
Later, if time permitted,

238
00:15:15,952 --> 00:15:18,613
we could basically paint over these with a polish pass.

239
00:15:19,253 --> 00:15:19,833
As you can see,

240
00:15:21,614 --> 00:15:23,235
the train now has gone through a polish pass.

241
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:27,097
It has increased contrast, weathering, and details.

242
00:15:28,757 --> 00:15:30,438
So the information in these style guides

243
00:15:30,878 --> 00:15:33,399
really allowed for quick iterations

244
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,180
and the rapid creation of assets.

245
00:15:36,698 --> 00:15:41,600
Because of this, the art could be iterated upon when changes to the story occurred without

246
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:46,862
severely affecting the production schedule. This was critical in order to give our writers

247
00:15:46,922 --> 00:15:50,783
the freedom they needed to tell the story they wanted to tell in the time that was given

248
00:15:50,803 --> 00:15:56,285
to them. So in about a year and a half, we created

249
00:15:56,665 --> 00:16:01,126
78 environments, 45 characters, 2,316 textures, and a few more.

250
00:16:04,662 --> 00:16:08,485
275 objects, 77 effects, and a zombie factory.

251
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:13,468
At one point, the entire company worked on the project, but the core development team

252
00:16:13,928 --> 00:16:17,010
that created the majority of this art consisted of about six artists.

253
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,033
The final product.

254
00:16:23,094 --> 00:16:28,298
Using the resources available to us and embracing our constraints, we created art that successfully

255
00:16:28,398 --> 00:16:30,139
aided in the telling of a mature story.

256
00:16:31,202 --> 00:16:36,067
By merging the look of the comic with Telltale's familiar illustrative style, we created a

257
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:38,729
beautiful and commercially successful zombie apocalypse.

258
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,474
If there's one thing I learned from working on The Walking Dead, it's this.

259
00:16:44,515 --> 00:16:48,099
Trust in what you do best as a studio and let that shine through the product.

260
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:48,960
Thank you.

261
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:03,536
And we have time for questions, so if anyone has any, feel free to ask.

262
00:17:11,254 --> 00:17:12,975
Great work, really love it.

263
00:17:13,155 --> 00:17:14,355
And I had a question.

264
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:19,498
You commented a little bit about how the final 3D

265
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,120
environments were really driven so much by the concept

266
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,961
art, the style of the concept art.

267
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:27,723
Could you talk a little bit more about if there were other

268
00:17:28,603 --> 00:17:32,985
areas where the concept art team was interacting with the

269
00:17:33,286 --> 00:17:34,726
modeling team and the texturing team?

270
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:35,627
Because it almost seems like.

271
00:17:36,227 --> 00:17:40,910
As opposed to normally when there's a painting and it might translate to photorealistic textures,

272
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,811
here it seemed like there was a lot more overlap.

273
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:43,231
Mm-hmm.

274
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:44,712
There definitely was.

275
00:17:44,752 --> 00:17:49,294
And even in some cases, they would actually create concepts based on what we had gray

276
00:17:49,314 --> 00:17:49,654
boxed.

277
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:53,496
At times, you know, they would actually fill us in with a few textures.

278
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:55,657
They'd come up with some ideas, and that was really cool.

279
00:17:55,697 --> 00:17:59,980
We could kind of bounce off of each other in order to create some really beautiful work.

280
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:00,700
Great.

281
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,140
Thanks.

282
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:07,992
One of the things I love about the game was that the characters were very stylized but

283
00:18:08,012 --> 00:18:11,896
still very emotionally expressive, which I think really contributed to how emotionally

284
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,899
mature and dramatic the game was and how much everyone liked it.

285
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:21,586
Can you speak to sort of using those very stylized faces to convey these very heavy

286
00:18:21,646 --> 00:18:23,348
and serious emotions that were maybe not...

287
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:35,597
So, that's really what we invest a lot of our technology into.

288
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:39,458
So, what do you do?

289
00:18:39,478 --> 00:18:45,099
Well, there's, you know, there's basically, they are able to create style guides that

290
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:50,220
showcase various emotions, and it's really not my department as far as how that is acted

291
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:50,500
out.

292
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,721
But it's pretty cool what we're able to do at the company.

293
00:18:59,496 --> 00:19:04,180
When you were creating the art, I've never tried to do a visual style like that.

294
00:19:04,661 --> 00:19:06,542
Which maps do you use?

295
00:19:06,582 --> 00:19:09,325
Was that all diffuse only and an emphasis on the line work?

296
00:19:09,405 --> 00:19:09,665
It was.

297
00:19:09,685 --> 00:19:11,026
Yeah, so we didn't use any normal maps.

298
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:15,490
It was all diffuse based, no specular maps, basic Lambert shading.

299
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,211
Wow.

300
00:19:16,491 --> 00:19:16,711
Yeah.

301
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:17,812
Very cool, thanks.

302
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:23,657
Where will you be this Sunday night?

303
00:19:27,548 --> 00:19:29,049
I've got a date, actually, so...

304
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:30,570
Yeah.

305
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,270
Good choice.

306
00:19:38,573 --> 00:19:38,773
Yeah.

307
00:19:42,835 --> 00:19:43,355
Oh, five?

308
00:19:45,016 --> 00:19:47,357
Okay.

309
00:19:47,557 --> 00:19:49,438
Hi, you briefly mentioned how...

310
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,359
Why everyone's looking at me.

311
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:53,520
Um, you briefly mentioned how...

312
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,731
As the episodes would progress, there would be a color progression.

313
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:05,834
Are there any other ways that you progressed how the story and the place in the story,

314
00:20:07,895 --> 00:20:12,837
not the physical location, but like the temporal element of the story,

315
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:17,419
like where the story is progressing and how the characters are feeling,

316
00:20:17,439 --> 00:20:18,980
like how that plays into the environment?

317
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,241
Can you repeat the question again?

318
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:22,241
Yeah, so how does...

319
00:20:23,242 --> 00:20:28,547
And what ways does the tone of the story affect the environment in other ways other than just

320
00:20:28,587 --> 00:20:30,529
the color progression in the episode?

321
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,450
Okay, yeah.

322
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:36,015
So I showed a slide earlier that was like the slaughterhouse right in the back of the

323
00:20:36,055 --> 00:20:36,315
barn.

324
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:36,675
Yeah.

325
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:42,261
And so, you know, it wasn't like we would basically, that's a scene that we really wanted

326
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:42,861
to be scary.

327
00:20:43,082 --> 00:20:44,503
So we added a lot more mood into that.

328
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,205
And that was reflected really in the concept.

329
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:51,131
Basically, the concept artists would basically see what was going on with the story.

330
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:52,232
They would get a pitch from there.

331
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:57,779
Then they would basically be able to do what they do best and concept some art out.

332
00:20:57,979 --> 00:20:59,241
It should have a lot of mood to it.

333
00:20:59,682 --> 00:21:03,647
Where you see sometimes, like in St. John's Dairy.

334
00:21:04,782 --> 00:21:07,364
You could see that it was just in daytime,

335
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:10,206
and you could see how that progressed as the night came.

336
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:11,827
We had a lot of rain and atmosphere.

337
00:21:12,447 --> 00:21:15,490
And in some cases, it just evolved that way.

338
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,632
I know when we were first making that specific scene,

339
00:21:18,672 --> 00:21:21,874
it wasn't going to have any rain or any lightning

340
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:22,634
or anything like that.

341
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:24,476
But as we started making the game,

342
00:21:24,516 --> 00:21:27,778
we saw that that was just going to add to the scene

343
00:21:27,818 --> 00:21:29,559
if we added all that contrast in there.

344
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:31,260
Thank you.

345
00:21:34,938 --> 00:21:40,703
Hi. You mentioned earlier that the art is based off of the comics.

346
00:21:41,223 --> 00:21:45,908
But I wanted to know, did you take anything either during the project or personally from

347
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:49,250
the show at all? Like, while making the environments?

348
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:52,373
We looked at the whole IP. Okay, cool.

349
00:21:52,593 --> 00:21:54,495
And there was also a few other things we looked at.

350
00:21:54,735 --> 00:21:56,096
I'm just not allowed to talk about them here.

351
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:57,798
Okay, that's fine. Thank you.

352
00:21:57,918 --> 00:21:59,820
But I love the whole, yeah, the whole series is amazing.

353
00:22:02,677 --> 00:22:05,798
Hi, so my question is a bit about the modularity, I guess.

354
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:08,138
So I saw that I played the game, and the environments,

355
00:22:08,158 --> 00:22:11,899
they look really, really good and really different.

356
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,880
And I noticed that the colors change a lot.

357
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,281
So I want to know, did you guys reuse many things?

358
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:19,261
Because I know, since most of the things

359
00:22:19,281 --> 00:22:21,301
were in the textures, like the other guy's question asked,

360
00:22:21,682 --> 00:22:23,202
did you guys reuse a lot of the props?

361
00:22:23,562 --> 00:22:24,782
Or was it totally unique?

362
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,823
Because the environments, they do look,

363
00:22:26,983 --> 00:22:29,543
you can really feel the difference in the pacing.

364
00:22:29,603 --> 00:22:32,144
So yes, the question was, do we reuse anything?

365
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,045
Okay, and yes, we do.

366
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:37,108
The trick is to not make it look that way,

367
00:22:37,748 --> 00:22:40,871
and I would say that lighting played an integral part with that.

368
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:45,645
One thing that I did was actually create an asset library.

369
00:22:46,486 --> 00:22:48,067
And that was, that you could easily,

370
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:49,928
see most engines have this basically,

371
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:52,471
where you can, you have all your different assets

372
00:22:52,491 --> 00:22:54,272
and you can easily populate a scene.

373
00:22:54,813 --> 00:22:57,715
And that was actually really helpful with everything we were doing.

374
00:22:57,775 --> 00:23:01,158
Especially once we reached like episode four and five.

375
00:23:01,618 --> 00:23:03,480
And we, you know, our schedule got crunched.

376
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,442
And so really setting up some of these techniques

377
00:23:06,482 --> 00:23:08,843
that we could create environments and scenes

378
00:23:08,883 --> 00:23:10,504
really quickly was essential.

379
00:23:10,944 --> 00:23:13,926
And then using, you know, we had a little bit of tech

380
00:23:13,946 --> 00:23:16,908
where we could take textures and shift the color around.

381
00:23:17,508 --> 00:23:18,429
And then, of course, with lighting.

382
00:23:18,469 --> 00:23:19,889
It's amazing what you can do with lighting

383
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,630
to cover a lot of that up.

384
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:23,071
Thanks.

385
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:30,332
Speaking of lighting, could you tell us how many lights you needed on average in a scene,

386
00:23:30,373 --> 00:23:30,853
and what kind?

387
00:23:30,913 --> 00:23:37,037
So, well we had per-vertex lighting, but that was all real-time lights, and that was mainly

388
00:23:37,077 --> 00:23:37,837
on the characters.

389
00:23:38,438 --> 00:23:43,161
For environment specifically, we could use any astronomical number, basically, because

390
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:44,101
it was all baked lighting.

391
00:23:45,474 --> 00:23:48,155
We did use ambient occlusion as well where appropriate.

392
00:23:48,175 --> 00:23:51,077
So it didn't really matter when it came to baked lighting.

393
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:57,261
In some cases, we were able to override some of the baked lighting with real-time lighting.

394
00:23:57,781 --> 00:24:00,663
And that's usually about four point lights that we have access to.

395
00:24:03,004 --> 00:24:03,605
Sometimes less.

396
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:07,007
Depends on if it ships on, like, iPhone or not.

397
00:24:07,827 --> 00:24:08,007
Yeah.

398
00:24:10,469 --> 00:24:10,769
All right.

399
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:11,430
Is that it?

400
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,411
Thank you all for coming.

401
00:24:13,931 --> 00:24:14,471
Really appreciate it.
