1
00:00:07,692 --> 00:00:14,059
My name is Tim Fowers and I'm here for creating Bruegel Bros. or Bruegel Brothers, it's still

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,020
undecided.

3
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:16,842
Fantasy of the Heist.

4
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:19,105
All right.

5
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:22,489
Is this going to focus?

6
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:23,290
Okay, how do I...

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,333
Do I have to give focus to this thing to move?

8
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,523
There we go.

9
00:00:35,563 --> 00:00:36,044
OK.

10
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:37,826
All right.

11
00:00:39,288 --> 00:00:40,810
So I'm an indie developer.

12
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:41,811
I started about 10 years ago.

13
00:00:41,831 --> 00:00:45,757
And I made a couple indie games on my own and with some

14
00:00:45,777 --> 00:00:47,779
friends, and one was called Now Boarding.

15
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:49,261
And

16
00:00:49,785 --> 00:00:52,486
We did that for a couple of years.

17
00:00:52,626 --> 00:00:56,507
And over time, I wasn't always working out long term.

18
00:00:56,767 --> 00:00:59,248
Well, let's head it over to the industry.

19
00:00:59,288 --> 00:01:02,349
So I worked at Amazon Game Studios in Southern California

20
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:03,790
for three or four years.

21
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,371
And then during all these processes on the side,

22
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:09,251
I was working on board games.

23
00:01:09,912 --> 00:01:12,732
Because I fell in love with making video games and board

24
00:01:12,752 --> 00:01:13,613
games at the same time.

25
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:16,915
And I really see them as kind of two sides of the same coin.

26
00:01:16,975 --> 00:01:20,617
So I made a game called Paperback and a game called

27
00:01:20,877 --> 00:01:21,417
Virgo Brothers.

28
00:01:22,258 --> 00:01:23,979
And both have done really, really well.

29
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:28,502
And I've been trying to take that indie aesthetic, that's

30
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:31,123
the skills you learn being an indie and doing these really

31
00:01:31,163 --> 00:01:34,625
kind of quality games, and bring it over to board games.

32
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:36,427
And it's proven to work out really, really well.

33
00:01:37,327 --> 00:01:37,447
And

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,782
So I'm going to talk about the differences between board games and video games.

35
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:50,585
Because they're similar, but the difference is that board games are software that run on people.

36
00:01:51,456 --> 00:01:56,360
So you're writing this code and people have to like ingest this all, have this going in their brain,

37
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,822
and you don't want to break the compiler, you don't have too many rules,

38
00:02:00,523 --> 00:02:05,146
and they're the ones that they're experiencing these rules, but it's all transparent.

39
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:09,410
Because video games are like this black box, right?

40
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,952
You're giving it inputs and you're getting certain outputs,

41
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:14,594
and you're trying to figure out what the rules are inside that box.

42
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:18,695
And you get kind of a sense of what's going on, but it still

43
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:19,975
surprises you in certain ways.

44
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:25,176
But the ways that board games surprise you are through, you

45
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:25,957
know all the rules.

46
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:28,597
All the rules are in your head, and they're

47
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:29,397
combined in new ways.

48
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:31,418
And you're like, oh, that's a combination.

49
00:02:31,478 --> 00:02:33,518
I didn't think of using that card and that card together,

50
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:35,479
or powers together, or whatever.

51
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:40,080
And so it's this delight through emergence, not through

52
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,481
finding out a new rule of what's going on under the hood.

53
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:48,002
And the other thing about board games is its very raw design.

54
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:52,845
You, as a designer, you've got a box of parts and instructions,

55
00:02:53,345 --> 00:02:54,806
and it's got to sing.

56
00:02:55,286 --> 00:02:58,768
It's got to entertain and pull all these emotions out

57
00:02:58,788 --> 00:02:59,089
of people.

58
00:02:59,869 --> 00:03:02,190
And we talk about a lot of emotions in video games,

59
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,211
but there's a lot of emotion in board games.

60
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:09,385
And I want to talk about some of the range of emotions you can have here.

61
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:14,291
So you've got your werewolf mafia, and that's about, you know, and Secret Hiller.

62
00:03:16,073 --> 00:03:18,496
It's about deceit.

63
00:03:18,596 --> 00:03:23,842
Like what's the key moment in that game when you're like, it's when everyone believes you

64
00:03:24,042 --> 00:03:25,284
and you've got them all fooled.

65
00:03:26,911 --> 00:03:37,195
If you want to turn it up higher, I don't know if many of you have played this, but diplomacy is literally you have to stab all your friends in the back to win one at a time.

66
00:03:37,896 --> 00:03:42,777
Gain their trust, and then it's like Survivor. You're voting them off at the last minute and it's tragic.

67
00:03:43,238 --> 00:03:44,998
And do not play it. It will end friendships.

68
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:48,800
Because that's the level of emotion that board games can create.

69
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,481
And then there's, you know, Settlers. It's about reciprocity and trade.

70
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:56,443
To get to Rideware, it's about prioritizing, you know, building your network.

71
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,784
But in cooperative game, it's about altruism.

72
00:04:00,205 --> 00:04:05,027
It's about sacrificing for each other and collectively problem solving.

73
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:09,549
And there's all these positive emotions around it and that's why I've been drawn to it.

74
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:13,291
Because in board games, you test a lot and you test live.

75
00:04:13,891 --> 00:04:17,933
And I get driven by the energy that comes off of cooperative games.

76
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:22,392
So where do we derive our emotions from?

77
00:04:22,552 --> 00:04:24,674
And a lot of times it's from other media.

78
00:04:25,174 --> 00:04:26,875
Let's see, there we go.

79
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:30,759
Other media, so we watch these movies, TV shows, books,

80
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,120
and they all have these moments, right,

81
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:36,303
that we want to capture.

82
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:40,366
And so often in video games, we think literally.

83
00:04:40,606 --> 00:04:43,609
We're like, okay, well, let's capture the scene

84
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:46,531
or the visual or the cinematography.

85
00:04:47,332 --> 00:04:47,452
But.

86
00:04:49,262 --> 00:04:54,507
I think that what we really want, what we can get to with video games and with board

87
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:56,328
games is the emotion at the core of it.

88
00:04:57,377 --> 00:04:59,199
And, because really what it comes down to

89
00:04:59,239 --> 00:05:01,460
is these scenarios, you know, am I doing a heist?

90
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,802
Am I, you know, surviving on an island?

91
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:05,583
Am I learning Kung Fu?

92
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:07,585
You know, they get to the point of

93
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:09,886
what would I do in that situation?

94
00:05:10,307 --> 00:05:12,588
Like, that's when I talk about the fantasy of the heist

95
00:05:12,648 --> 00:05:14,990
is like, we really ask ourselves this

96
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,031
when we're looking at different media

97
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:19,773
and you're like, yeah, if I could fly, I would do X.

98
00:05:19,973 --> 00:05:22,035
Or, you know, there's all these kind of scenarios

99
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:22,775
we put ourselves through.

100
00:05:23,296 --> 00:05:23,496
And so,

101
00:05:24,645 --> 00:05:30,397
Through developing burgle bros, I've kind of got a system now that I use, and this wasn't

102
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:33,022
all intentional, but this is the method that I came to, was that...

103
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:40,412
You take a scene or a moment in what you're trying to,

104
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,673
your source material, whatever that material is,

105
00:05:43,453 --> 00:05:45,995
and you peel it back, and you peel back,

106
00:05:46,035 --> 00:05:47,315
and you find at the nugget,

107
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,836
what is the, at the best moment of that scene,

108
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:51,597
what are you actually feeling?

109
00:05:52,158 --> 00:05:54,259
And then you try systems to recreate it.

110
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:57,821
You try choices, and you try game systems,

111
00:05:58,001 --> 00:05:59,922
game mechanics to reproduce it.

112
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:02,063
And it takes a lot of iteration to find something

113
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,443
that can get the emotion that you want.

114
00:06:03,824 --> 00:06:08,067
Because anytime you create a system, there's going to be other things that, unintended consequences.

115
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:14,051
So you gotta clean it up, and you gotta have to mitigate certain parts of that system that you don't really want.

116
00:06:14,872 --> 00:06:20,316
And then you tie it back into the theme. You're like, okay, if we have the system, what else would happen in that mechanic?

117
00:06:20,376 --> 00:06:22,878
And weave it back into your theme.

118
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:28,962
And this is the method that I've kind of discovered with Bruegel Bros.

119
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:30,583
So...

120
00:06:31,618 --> 00:06:34,179
I started with a hybrid game.

121
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:39,121
I was working on an app that you interacted with a board game, and it was about a heist.

122
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:47,145
And I went to Gen Con, I'm like, I'm demoing this game, and I'm like, because you go and

123
00:06:47,165 --> 00:06:49,366
you get people to playtest when you're a board game creator.

124
00:06:49,386 --> 00:06:52,088
You're like, okay, come play my game, and you've got to convince this guy that doesn't

125
00:06:52,128 --> 00:06:54,029
know who you are that this game is awesome.

126
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:56,950
And I'm like, okay, it's like Ocean's Eleven, the board game.

127
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:59,731
And their eyes lit up, and they're like, I want to play that game.

128
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:04,317
And they'd come over and they'd play it, and the game was horrible, and I apologized to

129
00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:05,058
everybody that played it.

130
00:07:05,678 --> 00:07:07,120
Because it didn't fulfill that.

131
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,403
But that put this bug in my head.

132
00:07:09,423 --> 00:07:11,525
I'm like, this is something people want.

133
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:15,810
People want to live out a heist, and they want to know what choices they would make

134
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,032
in that situation.

135
00:07:18,574 --> 00:07:18,794
So...

136
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:19,435
Um...

137
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:22,866
So I came up with Burgle Bros.

138
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:24,929
And Burgle Bros. was this,

139
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:26,811
I'm gonna talk about the process of how we got there.

140
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:29,394
But the high level is, it's a cooperative heist.

141
00:07:29,955 --> 00:07:31,837
And this is a fun tower that you can play it on,

142
00:07:31,857 --> 00:07:33,199
but you normally play it flat.

143
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:35,382
And it's, you have these three floors.

144
00:07:36,294 --> 00:07:37,334
that you're exploring.

145
00:07:37,555 --> 00:07:38,956
Now, if anybody gets caught, it's over.

146
00:07:39,296 --> 00:07:40,817
It's kind of to have the high stakes.

147
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:43,179
Because you know, if you get caught, you're going to rat

148
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,401
on your friends so you don't go to jail.

149
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:47,303
And so it's three floors.

150
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:48,604
And there's a safe on each one.

151
00:07:48,624 --> 00:07:50,806
And there's a whole sequence of how you open the safe and

152
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:51,927
find the combination to the safe.

153
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:56,349
But on top of everything is all these tiles are alarms

154
00:07:56,429 --> 00:07:58,750
and traps with different rules about how you can get

155
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,631
through them and whether they trigger an alarm.

156
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:04,093
And then on top of that, there's this guard patrolling

157
00:08:04,133 --> 00:08:06,334
on each floor and he's using a waypoint system.

158
00:08:07,094 --> 00:08:11,797
And so you have these three stealth tokens

159
00:08:11,837 --> 00:08:13,698
and everyone has three stealth and if you lose all three

160
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:16,719
of your stealth, you're caught.

161
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,460
So that's the stakes.

162
00:08:19,052 --> 00:08:20,973
So going back to the source material,

163
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:23,035
let's look at a heist, right?

164
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,017
These are the tropes of a heist,

165
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:25,778
and these aren't all of them,

166
00:08:25,818 --> 00:08:27,659
but these are some high points, right?

167
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:29,641
So we're gonna assemble the team,

168
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:31,143
we're gonna get all the, you know,

169
00:08:31,163 --> 00:08:32,644
we're gonna get out of jail or whatever,

170
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:35,807
we're gonna assemble the players, right?

171
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:37,348
And then we're going to make a plan,

172
00:08:37,508 --> 00:08:39,110
we're gonna pick our target, make a plan,

173
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,452
and there's always a montage of all the different alarms

174
00:08:41,492 --> 00:08:43,414
and guards we have to get through and how impossible it is.

175
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:47,517
And then you start the plan and you're evading the guards

176
00:08:47,597 --> 00:08:48,838
and getting through all the alarms

177
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:49,979
and everything's going according to plan.

178
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:51,700
You need to get to the safe and you're cracking the safe

179
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,682
or you're downloading the thing and little bars going

180
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:56,484
and you're sweating bullets and then something goes wrong.

181
00:08:56,664 --> 00:08:58,006
Like there's always something that goes wrong.

182
00:08:58,026 --> 00:08:58,866
There's a twist, right?

183
00:08:59,467 --> 00:08:59,687
And then...

184
00:09:00,888 --> 00:09:02,328
You pull off a miracle.

185
00:09:03,349 --> 00:09:05,030
Or maybe you had a plan all along.

186
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,191
You had a backup plan and it comes into effect.

187
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:10,052
And then there's the grand exit.

188
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,352
It's like, yeah, we made it out.

189
00:09:11,412 --> 00:09:13,173
And high fives and go spend our money.

190
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:14,514
So let's break this out.

191
00:09:14,614 --> 00:09:18,435
So assembling a team, the core emotion here is...

192
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,703
How am I going to contribute to this team?

193
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:26,646
So it's partially contribution, but I think there's something underneath there.

194
00:09:27,707 --> 00:09:29,228
When you're picking a character, you're often like,

195
00:09:29,288 --> 00:09:30,629
okay, well what powers does he have?

196
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:31,590
Like, what can he do?

197
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,812
And often when you're designing these kind of roles,

198
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:37,135
you want to think, like, how can everybody break one rule of the game?

199
00:09:37,155 --> 00:09:40,278
Because that makes you feel powerful and special in a group.

200
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:45,568
And that's interesting, but underneath there's a character

201
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:46,668
to each one of these.

202
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:48,990
And so I had these different personas we developed.

203
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,511
And because you're really, you're putting on a mask

204
00:09:51,671 --> 00:09:52,432
when you're playing a character.

205
00:09:52,472 --> 00:09:53,853
And this is in a lot of games.

206
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:56,795
And this is part of the whole,

207
00:09:56,895 --> 00:09:58,135
what would I do in this situation?

208
00:09:58,175 --> 00:09:59,736
And so now you're taking on a character

209
00:10:00,097 --> 00:10:02,238
of what I would do in that situation

210
00:10:02,698 --> 00:10:04,899
and experimenting and seeing what you would do.

211
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,560
How does this reflect on who I am?

212
00:10:07,461 --> 00:10:08,722
So that's just assembling the team.

213
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:10,423
So putting on the mask.

214
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:13,205
So then making a plan.

215
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:16,606
So early on in the design of Burgle Bros,

216
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:19,467
it was about like, okay, what's going on?

217
00:10:19,547 --> 00:10:20,448
Where are the guards gonna be?

218
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:21,588
Let's plan the whole thing out.

219
00:10:22,348 --> 00:10:23,629
Because that's a big part of the fantasy,

220
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:26,310
but it really ended up conflicting with

221
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,412
the ability to make kind of tactical decisions and whatnot.

222
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:31,733
Because if you think about it,

223
00:10:31,753 --> 00:10:32,974
like if you had to plan the whole thing,

224
00:10:32,994 --> 00:10:34,235
and then if you were wrong,

225
00:10:34,475 --> 00:10:35,776
you kind of just have to play the game again.

226
00:10:35,956 --> 00:10:38,837
Like it wasn't, it didn't make an interesting loop.

227
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:41,799
And so there's some counterintuitive things

228
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:43,920
that I had to move away from the trope.

229
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:45,001
And this is one of them.

230
00:10:45,101 --> 00:10:46,602
It was, because people are like,

231
00:10:46,782 --> 00:10:48,183
so you're breaking into this building

232
00:10:48,203 --> 00:10:49,444
and you know there's a safe there,

233
00:10:49,504 --> 00:10:51,505
but you literally know where none of the alarms are.

234
00:10:51,765 --> 00:10:55,027
Like you guys are not well-educated thieves

235
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:56,088
going into this place.

236
00:10:56,548 --> 00:10:58,010
But it was an important decision.

237
00:10:58,371 --> 00:11:05,461
And how this kind of works is the motion that was more important to me was the perfect prediction.

238
00:11:06,102 --> 00:11:11,670
And this is the moment where the guard's walking by and I'm perfectly stepping behind every statue.

239
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:17,254
I'm doing everything in sync and I'm totally predicting everything the guard is going to

240
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:20,896
do and I feel awesome because there's no way he's going to find me.

241
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:24,118
That led to a couple of different systems.

242
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:30,641
One is these tiles, so you're exploring and you have to take certain risks.

243
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:33,603
These tiles start face down and you can decide to run into a tile.

244
00:11:34,264 --> 00:11:35,965
and see what it is and hope that it's not bad.

245
00:11:36,245 --> 00:11:38,667
Or you can peek, but that takes, it's slower.

246
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:41,249
So you have to decide how quickly you want to do this.

247
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,411
And that gives an information horizon.

248
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:45,813
You're like, okay, I know I've already seen

249
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,535
some of these tiles, I don't know what that could be,

250
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:48,375
but I'm gonna take a risk.

251
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,378
And then on top of it is the waypoint system for the guard.

252
00:11:51,418 --> 00:11:53,700
The guard, he moves towards the next waypoint,

253
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,761
but then after that, he's gonna draw a card

254
00:11:55,801 --> 00:11:58,063
and you don't know if he's gonna go left or right.

255
00:11:58,463 --> 00:12:01,144
You know, you gotta take a guess.

256
00:12:01,164 --> 00:12:03,485
And so this creates these smaller moments,

257
00:12:03,525 --> 00:12:06,586
these small dynamic puzzles between the static puzzle

258
00:12:07,106 --> 00:12:10,087
of the tiles and the walls you have to move around

259
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:12,407
and the dynamic puzzle where the guard is at the time,

260
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:14,948
to you have to take a guess.

261
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:17,629
And by making the players take a risk,

262
00:12:18,229 --> 00:12:20,390
if it pays off, then like, oh, I knew it.

263
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,650
I knew he'd go that way.

264
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,731
And you feel like that prediction, right?

265
00:12:24,751 --> 00:12:26,531
You feel like I pulled it off correctly.

266
00:12:27,232 --> 00:12:33,273
And if he doesn't we had to create the other end because a big part of stealth is that it's high stakes

267
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:39,235
I mean, that's the thing about stealth games often in stealth games you get caught you're shot or you're go to jail or whatever

268
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:42,635
And so I was I wasn't sure how to do this

269
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:46,496
I wanted to have high stakes and and this is where you don't really design alone

270
00:12:46,616 --> 00:12:49,757
I mean people in board games probably design more alone than they do in video games

271
00:12:49,797 --> 00:12:51,458
But I went to my friend and I'm like

272
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:53,239
I don't know what to do.

273
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,920
I want people to lose, I want to have high stakes,

274
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,822
but he's just like, well, just give them hit points.

275
00:12:58,982 --> 00:13:00,243
They can get, you know, and so we came up

276
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:01,624
with these stealth tokens and he like,

277
00:13:02,184 --> 00:13:04,526
you disappear and you get three chances

278
00:13:04,546 --> 00:13:07,147
to hide from the guard and then you don't have any more

279
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:08,408
and next time he catches you.

280
00:13:09,229 --> 00:13:11,810
And what it introduces is soft loss

281
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,211
because you don't get the stealth back,

282
00:13:13,892 --> 00:13:17,014
but you have this definite progress towards losing

283
00:13:17,434 --> 00:13:19,335
anytime you're in the same tile as one of the guards.

284
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,951
All right, so perfect prediction is the fantasy.

285
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,692
So cracking the safe.

286
00:13:25,813 --> 00:13:29,435
So cracking the safe is you're trying to do it

287
00:13:29,495 --> 00:13:31,336
quickly as you can, but it's this unknown.

288
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:32,596
You're like, I can't do anything.

289
00:13:33,077 --> 00:13:34,658
It's only going to crack so fast.

290
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:36,779
Or I've got to guess numbers.

291
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,480
And you feel this pressure because you don't know when

292
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,200
the guard's going to come.

293
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,162
So the emotion here is you're going to get caught.

294
00:13:42,582 --> 00:13:45,284
Right? And so I definitely wanted some randomness.

295
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,386
And you know, you really got to watch the randomness, though,

296
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:50,347
because when we first did it, we're like, oh,

297
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:52,369
if you roll the right numbers, you get in.

298
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:53,869
And it was just kind of like quick.

299
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,971
Like sometimes it was really quick, and sometimes it was,

300
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,232
you know, too long, and it was frustrating.

301
00:13:58,252 --> 00:14:01,494
And again, you know, I went to a friend, and I'm just like,

302
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:05,577
well, how do I, how do you mitigate this luck problem?

303
00:14:05,597 --> 00:14:06,678
Because I want it to be random.

304
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:09,179
Because then when you roll the six, there's this cheer.

305
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,384
But, you know, so, you know, came up with a system and it was like, you can invest in

306
00:14:14,424 --> 00:14:18,547
more dice so you can make a safer, you know, you can roll more dice when you do roll dice

307
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:20,209
and it makes the whole thing safer.

308
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:24,272
Or you can be risky, ah, we can do it with like one die or two die, we're lucky, and

309
00:14:24,292 --> 00:14:25,934
then, you know, but it might take you twice as long.

310
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:27,475
And that certainly happens.

311
00:14:28,196 --> 00:14:31,118
And then the other part of like, I'm working on the safe and I don't know how long that's

312
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:32,900
going to take, and then there's the guard, the guard is coming.

313
00:14:34,534 --> 00:14:36,556
When we first played it, there was this moment where

314
00:14:37,497 --> 00:14:39,879
after every player's turn, the guard on that floor moves.

315
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:41,460
And so somebody's like, so if I go upstairs,

316
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:42,681
only that guard will move?

317
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:44,403
And I'm like, well, yeah, it's kind of like the movie

318
00:14:44,463 --> 00:14:47,205
where the action is only where the camera is.

319
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:48,646
So if the camera's up here,

320
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:50,628
you assume that nothing's happening on this other floor.

321
00:14:50,688 --> 00:14:54,391
So would it allow it as a side effect?

322
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,794
So he's like, so if I go upstairs, he won't get caught.

323
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,516
He's like, well, I'm like, I guess not.

324
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:08,441
So now a whole part of the game is manipulating the guard through which floor are you going to activate, so where are you going to end your turn.

325
00:15:09,122 --> 00:15:14,665
And some people even didn't like that. They're like, that's unrealistic. Why aren't the other guards moving?

326
00:15:14,685 --> 00:15:20,349
And I'm like, it works as a tool to give the players to solve their problems.

327
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:23,264
And it also gives us another thing,

328
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:26,206
and little side note is about vulnerability.

329
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,547
And the TED talk about vulnerability

330
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:30,488
and how it's how we form relationships as humans,

331
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:33,330
it's core to cooperative experiences.

332
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,011
And if you think about Left 4 Dead, right?

333
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:38,413
Left 4 Dead, you know, you get pinned, right?

334
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:41,474
And a zombie's on you and you literally can do nothing.

335
00:15:41,894 --> 00:15:43,035
And then one of your friends comes over

336
00:15:43,055 --> 00:15:44,536
and kicks the zombie off and shoots him,

337
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:47,658
and he reaches down and he pulls you up.

338
00:15:48,493 --> 00:15:52,037
And he's accepted you as a friend, but also as,

339
00:15:52,157 --> 00:15:53,299
you're important to this mission,

340
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,420
you're important to this team.

341
00:15:55,261 --> 00:15:57,063
And sacrificing for each other,

342
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,346
and giving these moments where I can save someone else

343
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:03,310
is how relationships are formed.

344
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:06,774
And I just think it's really important, sorry, side note.

345
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,671
So something always goes wrong, right?

346
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:14,634
So this is the best laid plans,

347
00:16:14,814 --> 00:16:16,035
and it's tricky in a board game.

348
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:18,136
Like, I didn't know how to have the twist

349
00:16:18,176 --> 00:16:19,598
where something goes wrong,

350
00:16:20,418 --> 00:16:22,180
and how do I get that paced in the game,

351
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,060
and how does that even fit in?

352
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,522
And it actually came from

353
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:27,184
kind of the most benign part of the game.

354
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:32,649
There was this moment where one of my friends was playing and he's like on the bottom floor

355
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:36,152
and he's like, so there's a guard outside, so I'm literally going to do nothing on my

356
00:16:36,172 --> 00:16:36,353
turn.

357
00:16:36,373 --> 00:16:37,994
And I'm like, well, yeah.

358
00:16:38,395 --> 00:16:42,579
And we came up with this thing where when you don't use a certain number of actions,

359
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,080
you roll a dice.

360
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:47,684
And that can be something good or something bad, but it's an unknown.

361
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:50,465
And then eventually it became like a deck of cards.

362
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:53,146
And it actually, if you think about it,

363
00:16:53,206 --> 00:16:55,186
like the moment that you're hiding in the closet

364
00:16:55,206 --> 00:16:56,146
and the guard is coming by

365
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:58,707
is exactly when something is going to crash.

366
00:16:59,047 --> 00:16:59,867
And something, you know,

367
00:16:59,907 --> 00:17:01,707
or a cat's gonna spook something

368
00:17:01,747 --> 00:17:03,488
or something good or bad is gonna happen.

369
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:05,028
And so we call it the event deck

370
00:17:05,468 --> 00:17:07,188
and it ended up being this great way

371
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,509
to both mitigate kind of the boring moments of the game,

372
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,869
but also it only happens a couple times per game.

373
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:13,450
And so it was a nice way to.

374
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,674
parse out these moments that could be plot twists.

375
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:17,757
And sometimes it'll save you too.

376
00:17:17,957 --> 00:17:18,999
It's a variable.

377
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:22,248
So all these things are happening, right?

378
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,570
The guards are speeding up over time.

379
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,271
We crack open a safe.

380
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:30,293
Now, when you get a safe open, you get two things.

381
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,034
You get a loot.

382
00:17:32,314 --> 00:17:33,155
This is what you came to steal.

383
00:17:33,195 --> 00:17:36,056
And it could be like a Chihuahua that randomly barks

384
00:17:36,477 --> 00:17:37,537
and sets off alarms or something.

385
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:40,379
They're silly things that you came here to steal.

386
00:17:40,639 --> 00:17:41,620
And then you get tools.

387
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,401
It's a one-shot ability.

388
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:46,683
So these tools are like an EMP or a crowbar.

389
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:49,545
And they give you one chance to do something really cool.

390
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:50,545
And.

391
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:54,799
And so all these things are moving towards the climax

392
00:17:54,879 --> 00:17:57,260
of like, okay, the guards are moving super fast,

393
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,581
we're all low on stealth, how are we gonna do,

394
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:00,962
and how are we gonna get out of this?

395
00:18:01,022 --> 00:18:04,144
And this is where the tension is the core emotion here.

396
00:18:04,804 --> 00:18:10,267
And this forced players into a corner of sorts,

397
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:13,369
like in a, it's more of an emotional corner

398
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:14,149
than a physical corner,

399
00:18:14,189 --> 00:18:15,250
but sometimes it's a physical corner.

400
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,691
But it was that they're stuck.

401
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,172
They're like, okay, we're gonna lose.

402
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:20,753
And I'm like, no, no, no.

403
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:22,894
Just, you know, you can figure out something.

404
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:24,315
And they would surprise me, and they're like,

405
00:18:24,335 --> 00:18:25,075
ah, I got it.

406
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,757
If I do, if I go here and trigger this alarm,

407
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,658
or I use my gadget, I use my tool,

408
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:31,259
or I use my player power,

409
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:33,540
and they started really thinking laterally,

410
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,901
and coming up with really creative solutions

411
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:37,082
of how to get out of these problems.

412
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:38,603
And it surprised me.

413
00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:41,364
I was just creating a system and turning up the heat,

414
00:18:41,925 --> 00:18:44,166
and people were like pulling off these crazy moves,

415
00:18:44,186 --> 00:18:47,488
and I'm like, okay, that's a really good solution to that.

416
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:50,468
And it doesn't always pan out either.

417
00:18:50,688 --> 00:18:51,929
Sometimes they fail, right?

418
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,993
And looking at failure is part of it as well.

419
00:18:55,574 --> 00:18:58,998
And how people see failure, like after a game,

420
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:01,802
you really don't want people being like,

421
00:19:02,122 --> 00:19:03,143
that was arbitrary.

422
00:19:03,564 --> 00:19:04,705
You want people saying like,

423
00:19:05,306 --> 00:19:05,947
I could have done...

424
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:10,650
I could have done another thing that would have let me win.

425
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:20,076
And so having that couch, having that emotional scapegoat really helps people want to reengage

426
00:19:20,096 --> 00:19:20,976
and want to retry a game.

427
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:23,618
And often cooperative games, people want a challenge.

428
00:19:23,658 --> 00:19:25,259
They often don't want to win on their first game.

429
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,760
So they can feel like, okay, I know what's going on now.

430
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:28,581
We're going to win this one.

431
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:29,682
And they'll get back into it.

432
00:19:30,622 --> 00:19:31,223
So yeah.

433
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:33,940
Then there's the grand exit, right?

434
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,881
So we got past the hardest problem in the game

435
00:19:35,922 --> 00:19:38,283
and we got the loot and we're headed out.

436
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:41,205
And this emotion is the relief.

437
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:43,387
So we had all the tension and the problem solving

438
00:19:43,627 --> 00:19:45,028
and the relief is that we made it out.

439
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:49,191
And this is where you really want the dramatic exit.

440
00:19:49,331 --> 00:19:52,173
This is like drop the mic, smash the guitar,

441
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:53,814
do a victory lap.

442
00:19:54,374 --> 00:19:56,116
It's like you wanna feel awesome

443
00:19:56,676 --> 00:19:57,717
and you wanna leave a mess.

444
00:19:58,077 --> 00:19:59,638
You just like, you're like, you know what?

445
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:05,262
And so we have this dramatic exit where you're leaving in a helicopter on the roof. And there

446
00:20:05,282 --> 00:20:10,145
was another side effect of the whole guard rules was, oh, if I go to the roof, there's no

447
00:20:10,185 --> 00:20:14,448
guards up there, so no guard moves on my turn. And so there's this moment where, oh, yeah,

448
00:20:14,468 --> 00:20:19,052
we're out of here. And everyone gets to leave and the guard doesn't get a move and you feel

449
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:24,916
like it takes the pressure off when all of a sudden you have an easy out.

450
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,759
And then there was also other moments where people surprised me.

451
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,766
They're like, so I have this tool that can make a staircase anywhere.

452
00:20:32,786 --> 00:20:34,227
I say we leave here.

453
00:20:34,248 --> 00:20:36,911
And the roof comes out and grappling hooks go up.

454
00:20:36,951 --> 00:20:40,676
And they're like, we're just going to leave right here and exit to our helicopter.

455
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:41,978
And it surprised me.

456
00:20:42,018 --> 00:20:42,839
And it was a great moment.

457
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:46,508
So the overall emotion, right?

458
00:20:46,568 --> 00:20:48,010
So how do these all add up?

459
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,132
You know, you're creating all these individual moments,

460
00:20:50,172 --> 00:20:54,377
but how do they sum together into the takeaway?

461
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:56,419
Like when I talked about these other board games,

462
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,164
and it kind of took me a while to realize what it was.

463
00:21:00,244 --> 00:21:02,407
And for Briggle Bros, it was cleverness.

464
00:21:03,107 --> 00:21:11,098
That I feel shrewd and clever and I outwitted them in a noncombative way.

465
00:21:11,118 --> 00:21:15,723
And this is where you want to decide where you're going to spend your money.

466
00:21:16,124 --> 00:21:17,966
And so this is where you evaluate. You're like, okay.

467
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,967
I'm looking back at my game and what moments or emotional beats from the source material

468
00:21:25,628 --> 00:21:27,070
did I reflect in my game?

469
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,171
And which ones didn't?

470
00:21:28,652 --> 00:21:30,173
Because they're not going to all make it in.

471
00:21:31,094 --> 00:21:36,881
But you have to look at which ones are pushing towards the overall emotion you're shooting

472
00:21:36,941 --> 00:21:37,001
for.

473
00:21:38,723 --> 00:21:40,423
And remember that there's short term emotions,

474
00:21:40,743 --> 00:21:43,484
so there's like a crisis, like I have to make a decision,

475
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:46,405
I'm rolling a die, I'm drawing a card,

476
00:21:46,665 --> 00:21:47,825
and there's a moment, right?

477
00:21:48,145 --> 00:21:50,606
But there's also longer emotions, there's dramatic,

478
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:53,146
there's the, is my character transforming,

479
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:56,387
am I getting stronger, are the waters rising,

480
00:21:56,807 --> 00:21:58,168
is the pressure getting higher,

481
00:21:58,508 --> 00:22:00,128
is there a climactic battle, you know,

482
00:22:00,228 --> 00:22:04,049
are these moving towards an overall more dramatic arc?

483
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:06,570
And that's satisfying from a storytelling perspective.

484
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:07,890
So.

485
00:22:09,147 --> 00:22:13,208
Coming back to games as a personality test.

486
00:22:13,828 --> 00:22:16,469
So this is, I think, at the core of what games are.

487
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:19,609
So you've had this mask on and now you take the mask off.

488
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:24,931
And you're like, how did it feel to be that character?

489
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:26,651
Is that who I am?

490
00:22:27,992 --> 00:22:29,733
You know, is that me?

491
00:22:30,793 --> 00:22:32,935
Do I want to be more of that person?

492
00:22:34,316 --> 00:22:36,237
And, you know, and then you see all these other masks,

493
00:22:36,257 --> 00:22:37,798
and you're like, oh, I want to try that one next time.

494
00:22:38,178 --> 00:22:41,000
And I think there's a lot of self-discovery, you know,

495
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,781
going on, because in the end, you're

496
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:45,042
answering the question of what would I do in that situation?

497
00:22:47,804 --> 00:22:52,346
If I was on an island, you know, yes, I would, you know, I'd figure out fire and I'd make a hut or whatever.

498
00:22:52,846 --> 00:22:56,228
And each of these is games or systems that let us answer these questions.

499
00:22:56,888 --> 00:23:01,570
And the bigger thing is when I talk about all these unintended consequences that came out of things,

500
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:05,412
it's like I was shooting for emotions through these systems,

501
00:23:05,492 --> 00:23:09,714
but then the real output of these was actually stories.

502
00:23:10,254 --> 00:23:11,957
So when people tell me about Burgle Bros, they're like,

503
00:23:12,077 --> 00:23:13,358
OK, this one time.

504
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:15,962
And then they go through the whole story of the sequence

505
00:23:16,002 --> 00:23:17,885
events that happened, and what they did, and what the guards

506
00:23:17,945 --> 00:23:18,906
did, and everything.

507
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:20,168
And it's their story.

508
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:27,448
It's the game reflected back on them and they were able to tell a story about who they were in that situation.

509
00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:33,774
And so the bigger thing about what would I do in a situation is when you have an answer, you now have something that you're going to tell.

510
00:23:33,974 --> 00:23:36,716
And more often, the failure is the better story.

511
00:23:37,237 --> 00:23:40,339
Like, the spectacular failure is the one that people tell.

512
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:47,846
And so games as story generators, I think, is what we're getting at when we're saying emotion.

513
00:23:49,485 --> 00:23:51,146
It's not just that you want them to,

514
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:53,607
you know, like a movie is gonna make you feel

515
00:23:53,627 --> 00:23:55,687
a particular way, and a game can make you feel

516
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:56,587
a lot of different ways,

517
00:23:57,008 --> 00:23:59,088
because it's through the lens of yourself.

518
00:24:00,108 --> 00:24:01,609
And that's it.

519
00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:03,669
Thank you for your time.

520
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:04,230
And.

521
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:04,450
And.

522
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:05,110
And.

523
00:24:11,352 --> 00:24:11,532
And.

524
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:12,112
And.

525
00:24:12,472 --> 00:24:12,572
And.

526
00:24:12,592 --> 00:24:12,672
And.

527
00:24:12,692 --> 00:24:12,752
And.

528
00:24:12,772 --> 00:24:12,892
And.

529
00:24:12,932 --> 00:24:13,032
And.

530
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:13,112
And.

531
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:14,593
And.

532
00:24:14,693 --> 00:24:14,773
And.

533
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:14,953
And.

534
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:15,193
And.

535
00:24:15,273 --> 00:24:15,413
And.

536
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:15,533
And.

537
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:15,613
And.

538
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:35,017
Hey, big fan of Burgle Brothers, but one thing I was wondering about when you talk about the emotion and controlling that is there's so much randomness between the setup and the cars that players get.

539
00:24:35,097 --> 00:24:39,459
How much effort did you spend in the design to not let things get too easy or too hard?

540
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:45,562
I had to, because it's basically a roguelike board game, right? There's all these variables.

541
00:24:46,163 --> 00:24:50,385
Very early on I locked in the guard system and a lot of the tiles.

542
00:24:51,446 --> 00:24:55,997
And I just played it a lot. It was almost a brute force. I mean sometimes you can Monte Carlo.

543
00:24:56,017 --> 00:24:57,680
There's all ways you can simulate board games.

544
00:24:59,104 --> 00:25:01,108
But I had to literally get a sense of

545
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:04,790
Even right after the Kickstarter, I was like,

546
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,451
okay, it's a little too easy,

547
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:09,214
and I just changed just a couple of card distributions,

548
00:25:09,714 --> 00:25:11,876
and it ended up pretty good.

549
00:25:11,896 --> 00:25:15,458
But it was a lot of work, just to get a sense of it.

550
00:25:15,518 --> 00:25:17,620
But it was, I guess, work.

551
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,242
I can't say that there's a specific thing.

552
00:25:21,907 --> 00:25:24,169
I mean, I try to make each individual obstacle

553
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:25,210
not insurmountable.

554
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:27,412
So like every event that comes up

555
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:28,613
or every tile that comes up,

556
00:25:29,213 --> 00:25:30,594
you know, there is a way around it

557
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:32,976
or multiple ways around it.

558
00:25:33,817 --> 00:25:35,538
But not just like you're hosed

559
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,660
because anything that feels super arbitrary

560
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,181
and you get stuck at that point

561
00:25:40,162 --> 00:25:42,004
can throw off both your distribution

562
00:25:42,064 --> 00:25:43,625
but also just throw off the experience.

563
00:25:43,945 --> 00:25:44,105
So.

564
00:25:45,026 --> 00:25:45,567
Thanks.

565
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:50,574
Hello. So this might be a little bit of a negative space question,

566
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:54,457
but you mentioned that you had given up on planning,

567
00:25:54,697 --> 00:25:56,198
like the planning aspect. Yeah. Right.

568
00:25:56,778 --> 00:26:00,541
And I worked on the stealth game in the past and we ran into similar issues like

569
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:01,562
planning's really hard,

570
00:26:02,183 --> 00:26:06,606
but it really feels like that is a core part of most heists things. Yeah.

571
00:26:06,626 --> 00:26:09,108
We gave up on as well. So I was wondering, uh, what,

572
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:12,971
what were the iterations that you tried if you tried more and if,

573
00:26:13,211 --> 00:26:15,913
was there anything that remotely worked and,

574
00:26:16,853 --> 00:26:18,514
If something did, why?

575
00:26:19,794 --> 00:26:21,274
It was mostly conceptual.

576
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:23,275
So this is why, I mean, to repeat the question,

577
00:26:23,935 --> 00:26:26,496
why not have the planning phase in the stealth?

578
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,837
It was just that we started to break out,

579
00:26:30,917 --> 00:26:32,797
like, okay, what information could you have?

580
00:26:33,757 --> 00:26:35,018
Would that information be useful?

581
00:26:35,698 --> 00:26:36,778
How much of a plan could you make?

582
00:26:37,658 --> 00:26:39,259
And we started, you know, so I had a friend

583
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,839
that we were kind of brainstorming this idea with,

584
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,920
and he's like, yeah, I had this idea for a planning game,

585
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,460
and I had my horrible...

586
00:26:47,601 --> 00:26:48,062
hybrid game.

587
00:26:48,462 --> 00:26:50,083
And we started brainstorming,

588
00:26:50,384 --> 00:26:52,105
and then I started getting on this thread where I'm like,

589
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,367
oh, and then once I figured out how the guards moved

590
00:26:54,387 --> 00:26:57,330
and whatnot, and then I did 15 pages before he came back,

591
00:26:57,370 --> 00:27:00,653
he's like, I think you're just running with this idea.

592
00:27:00,673 --> 00:27:02,835
And it just bore fruit, right?

593
00:27:03,035 --> 00:27:04,576
It's just like sometimes in design,

594
00:27:04,616 --> 00:27:06,017
like there is kind of the,

595
00:27:09,641 --> 00:27:11,402
The system that seems to be clicking and working,

596
00:27:11,823 --> 00:27:13,444
and there certainly is another game.

597
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:14,906
I'd love to make a prequel that's like,

598
00:27:15,346 --> 00:27:17,328
it sets up a game of Burgl,

599
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:20,892
and there's other games to be made.

600
00:27:22,313 --> 00:27:22,633
Thank you.

601
00:27:25,096 --> 00:27:26,537
All right, thanks guys.

602
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:29,320
Yeah, I'm happy to talk individually.
