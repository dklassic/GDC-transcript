1
00:00:03,502 --> 00:00:05,456
Hello, can you guys hear me?

2
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:08,374
Cool.

3
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:10,836
So hi.

4
00:00:10,836 --> 00:00:13,238
I'm not sure if we're going to have time for a Q&A,

5
00:00:13,238 --> 00:00:17,641
because I have only 25 minutes and over 100 slides.

6
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:20,863
So with that in mind, hi, I'm Nicolae Berbece.

7
00:00:20,863 --> 00:00:22,905
Most people know me as Xcelu.

8
00:00:22,905 --> 00:00:24,886
I founded that company.

9
00:00:24,886 --> 00:00:26,267
I worked on this game.

10
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:28,328
I also worked on these games, but these are less important

11
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:31,110
because they're browser games.

12
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,832
And I also talk about stuff, apparently,

13
00:00:32,832 --> 00:00:34,533
but none of that is important.

14
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:38,888
I'm here today to talk about the T word that everybody skips.

15
00:00:38,888 --> 00:00:41,848
And I'm sure you already know I'm talking about tutorials.

16
00:00:41,848 --> 00:00:46,830
So in short, tutorials are self-paced instructional phases

17
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,371
that provide step-by-step information in presenting

18
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:52,191
a concept to the player.

19
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:55,092
In the context of press the trigger on a controller,

20
00:00:55,092 --> 00:00:56,892
if you hold it in a different pop-ups

21
00:00:56,892 --> 00:00:58,793
are not very efficient when it comes to like.

22
00:01:00,616 --> 00:01:03,358
Yeah, you're laughing because you know what I'm doing, right?

23
00:01:03,358 --> 00:01:05,921
You're laughing because we've all been there.

24
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:09,364
We all know that tutorials have this bad reputation.

25
00:01:09,364 --> 00:01:12,667
And usually, they're badly designed.

26
00:01:12,667 --> 00:01:15,930
They feel like the developer is holding our hand.

27
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,332
I mean, have you ever wondered why her name is so similar to

28
00:01:18,332 --> 00:01:19,153
tutorial?

29
00:01:19,473 --> 00:01:25,055
Anyway, it's our fault for this. It's our fault that tutorials have this bad aura around them.

30
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:28,276
And it sucks because tutorials are super important.

31
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:30,757
They are the first impression you get on the game.

32
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:35,398
They are the first five minutes or the first few seconds.

33
00:01:35,398 --> 00:01:37,659
So with that in mind, what to avoid?

34
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,200
First up...

35
00:01:40,073 --> 00:01:41,013
Pop-ups.

36
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:42,293
Stop it with the pop-ups.

37
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:43,134
They're really annoying.

38
00:01:43,134 --> 00:01:48,515
They feel like you realize at the end of your development cycle that you figured out your

39
00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:51,676
players don't know how to play your game, so you just slap some information on the screen

40
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:52,657
really quickly.

41
00:01:52,657 --> 00:01:54,457
And we know they're bad, right?

42
00:01:54,457 --> 00:01:56,178
Because we make fun of them.

43
00:01:56,178 --> 00:01:59,639
If you look at Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, they make fun of pop-ups, right?

44
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:02,159
Like how annoying they are and how they break experience.

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,521
And then you look at Far Cry 4, and they do the exact same freaking thing.

46
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:09,122
So please stop it with the pop-ups.

47
00:02:09,442 --> 00:02:13,963
Mostly because they break the gameplay and it's a horrible thing to do.

48
00:02:13,963 --> 00:02:19,244
If you want to do something like this, at least embed the information within the game's universe.

49
00:02:19,244 --> 00:02:21,685
So it's more interesting and it doesn't break the gameplay.

50
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:24,286
And you might think, oh I need a 3D game to do this.

51
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:26,567
No you don't, you can do it in 2D games.

52
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:32,188
A lot of 2D games did this and it's immersive, it's nice, it's blended in that game world.

53
00:02:32,188 --> 00:02:34,209
Next up, controller schemes.

54
00:02:35,184 --> 00:02:36,105
Stop it.

55
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:37,505
We've all seen these.

56
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,246
And usually, you see this.

57
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:42,687
Actually, I want to see how effective these are.

58
00:02:42,687 --> 00:02:43,628
Memorize this.

59
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:45,709
Usually, you see this before you get

60
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:47,630
to play the game, like in a loading screen.

61
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,131
And they don't last on the screen for very long.

62
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:55,693
So who can tell me what the stealth button was?

63
00:02:55,693 --> 00:02:56,473
Yeah, I thought so.

64
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:59,015
What about the collect experience orbs button?

65
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:01,729
Yeah, you see?

66
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:05,073
The thing is, this is information overload.

67
00:03:05,073 --> 00:03:06,855
And showing the player something like this

68
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:08,797
is the equivalent of your friend explaining

69
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:11,480
the entire board game before you start playing.

70
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,182
And we all know how that feels.

71
00:03:13,557 --> 00:03:14,078
So don't do that.

72
00:03:14,078 --> 00:03:17,281
Another thing, bad controller prompts.

73
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:20,143
It's 2016, I shouldn't say that the game should display

74
00:03:20,143 --> 00:03:21,925
the correct prompts on the screen

75
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:24,027
based on the controller you're using,

76
00:03:24,027 --> 00:03:26,649
and yet that's not the case.

77
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:29,872
And it's really annoying, seriously, don't do this.

78
00:03:29,872 --> 00:03:32,855
This is another example.

79
00:03:32,855 --> 00:03:36,118
This is Sonic, and in here the character was telling me,

80
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:37,820
press the X button to do this.

81
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:45,509
And aside from the fact that the prompt was wrong, the prompt was baked in the voice line.

82
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:46,791
So please, please don't do that.

83
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:50,726
This is from my game, this is how I think they should be done.

84
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:55,649
When you use your keyboard, the keyboard prompts should show up and the instant you touch a

85
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:59,050
controller they should change in real time.

86
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:04,533
As well as when you touch the mouse, the cursor shows up and all the prompts disappear.

87
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:09,116
This is ideally how I think prompts should be handled and most developers don't do this

88
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:13,158
because it takes a lot of time to create all the prompts for all the controllers out there.

89
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:15,040
So I got bored and I did that.

90
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,101
So all of these are completely free for anybody

91
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:19,342
who wants to use them.

92
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,042
You can find them on that link.

93
00:04:21,042 --> 00:04:24,064
And if you don't manage to take a photo of that, don't worry.

94
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,365
Hello, you're watching this on the Vault online.

95
00:04:26,365 --> 00:04:27,885
You're here for this link.

96
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:28,406
We can move on.

97
00:04:28,406 --> 00:04:31,647
Another thing to avoid, walls of text.

98
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:34,168
Seriously, I shouldn't tell you this.

99
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:37,029
No player would go like, oh, goody, my gameplay

100
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:40,451
is interrupted by a wall of text.

101
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:41,832
Just what I wanted.

102
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:44,211
Don't do this.

103
00:04:44,211 --> 00:04:48,676
Don't teach mechanics that you immediately lose.

104
00:04:48,676 --> 00:04:49,597
Prototype did this.

105
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:52,220
Also, Bionic Commando, I think, did this.

106
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,423
It's a very good story tool.

107
00:04:54,423 --> 00:04:56,946
It's called Emedia's Res, where you drop the player

108
00:04:56,946 --> 00:04:59,609
in the middle of the story to make it more engaging.

109
00:04:59,609 --> 00:05:01,771
But it's not as good when it comes to mechanics.

110
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,262
So avoid this.

111
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,404
So with all these things in mind,

112
00:05:06,404 --> 00:05:09,567
like all these are bad things that you should avoid,

113
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:10,228
what to do?

114
00:05:10,228 --> 00:05:13,852
And you probably expect me to list a huge list of things

115
00:05:13,852 --> 00:05:17,435
to do like tools and stuff, but no, it's super simple.

116
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:19,838
It's like one sentence.

117
00:05:19,838 --> 00:05:22,601
Teach gradually through experience.

118
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:24,222
Don't break gameplay, don't do any of that.

119
00:05:24,222 --> 00:05:26,064
Teach gradually through experience.

120
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:32,841
While I'm working on my game Move or Die, it's a four-player party game, and I was looking at other four-player party games,

121
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:35,004
and I stumbled upon this game.

122
00:05:35,004 --> 00:05:41,490
Now, this was a really cool example of a good tutorial because in this game, you don't only move around the level,

123
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,515
you dash around the level by pressing a direction and a button.

124
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:50,880
And the way they teach you that is they made the menus interactive.

125
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,443
So the way you add an AI bot or a new player, you do this by dashing around.

126
00:05:56,443 --> 00:06:01,507
Even selecting a level, they make sure you understand how to move around the game in

127
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:03,068
the menu before you start playing.

128
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:04,168
So this is a great example.

129
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:10,789
Here's another example that I first saw on Mark Brown's YouTube channel, Game Maker's Toolkit,

130
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:13,130
which you should totally check out because it's awesome.

131
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:19,932
Let's say you have a game in which your character has to dismember the enemies instead of like shooting them right in the head.

132
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:24,273
How do you teach the player that? Well, if you're Dead Space, you first write,

133
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:25,893
Cut off their limbs on a whiteboard.

134
00:06:26,214 --> 00:06:29,497
followed by a pop-up that tells you how to cut off their limbs,

135
00:06:29,497 --> 00:06:32,840
followed by an audio log that basically tells you the same thing,

136
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,224
followed by another audio log that tells you the exact same thing,

137
00:06:37,224 --> 00:06:40,748
and you finally end in a pop-up called Dismemberment.

138
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:48,087
Now this is horrible, but the thing is, a few years early, four years earlier, a little

139
00:06:48,087 --> 00:06:51,128
game came out called Half-Life 2 that did the exact same thing.

140
00:06:51,128 --> 00:06:56,210
And the first thing they do is they put the image of a dismembered body in your mind by

141
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,092
showing you this, and then you move on, and you're like, you stumble upon this, and you're

142
00:07:01,092 --> 00:07:02,913
like, okay.

143
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:03,433
And you try to move on.

144
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,885
And you notice that a table is blocking your way, so you jump on it, you see some saw blades,

145
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:09,946
and you pick them up.

146
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:14,991
And the moment you pick them up, a zombie wanders in your view, and your first reaction

147
00:07:14,991 --> 00:07:19,096
is to get startled and to press the fire button, and that shoots out the saw blade, and it

148
00:07:19,096 --> 00:07:22,199
shows you that it's a very effective weapon against zombies.

149
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,882
Now that's teaching gradually through experience.

150
00:07:25,936 --> 00:07:33,060
Half-Life 2 is filled with examples like these, like the barnacles, the enemies that are on the ceiling and they suck you up with their tongue and kill you.

151
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,762
The way you are introduced to these enemies is in a very safe environment.

152
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:44,666
You see a bird flying to their tongue and you can immediately see how they work without being put into danger.

153
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:48,992
Later on, you move on, you stumble upon some barrels,

154
00:07:48,992 --> 00:07:51,135
you knock them over, and they just so happen

155
00:07:51,135 --> 00:07:52,978
to slide in a barnacle's tongue.

156
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:57,163
And now you know there are some explosive barrels in the game.

157
00:07:57,163 --> 00:07:58,645
So you put the two and two together,

158
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,189
and you realize that maybe you can do something like this.

159
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:05,208
which is really cool because you as a player figure this out.

160
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,989
If Half-Life 2 would come out today,

161
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:08,791
there would probably be like huge arrows,

162
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:13,074
like hey, you can combine these two things and explosions.

163
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:15,595
And other things as well, like the exploding zombies,

164
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,897
they're presented behind a wall.

165
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:19,078
When you were playing fetch with dog,

166
00:08:19,078 --> 00:08:20,118
you weren't actually playing fetch,

167
00:08:20,118 --> 00:08:21,860
they were teaching you how to destroy the helicopter.

168
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,043
or how to avoid these little annoying things.

169
00:08:26,043 --> 00:08:28,124
And there are more traditional tutorials in the game,

170
00:08:28,124 --> 00:08:30,025
but they are baked within that universe.

171
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:33,447
They are characters addressing your character,

172
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:35,829
or like things written on walls,

173
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:39,491
or it's within that universe, it's immersive.

174
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:42,053
So don't treat your players like morons.

175
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:44,314
One of the best examples out there

176
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:46,956
that I'm sure all of you know is Mario, of course.

177
00:08:46,956 --> 00:08:48,497
And this is a game that came out in 85.

178
00:08:49,724 --> 00:08:54,029
where you couldn't really afford to use text on the screen that much or pop-ups,

179
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:56,031
because we all know how that went.

180
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:59,055
Anyway, the thing is, with Mario, this is a great example

181
00:08:59,055 --> 00:09:01,517
because they teach you gradually through experience.

182
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:03,279
And I'm not going to go into detail, just Google this.

183
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,241
There are so many videos on this.

184
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:08,405
And they kept doing that with future iteration.

185
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:11,008
Like, for example, this is how they teach you that you can double jump.

186
00:09:11,448 --> 00:09:14,410
by just having a subtle trail of coins.

187
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,011
And in later titles, in Super Mario 3D World,

188
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:20,272
where they introduce new mechanics almost every level

189
00:09:20,272 --> 00:09:22,133
and they gradually ramp up the difficulty,

190
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,374
which is awesome.

191
00:09:24,374 --> 00:09:28,576
So yes, teach gradually through experience.

192
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:30,316
Some other amazing examples is Mega Man X,

193
00:09:30,316 --> 00:09:31,957
where they teach you almost...

194
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:37,885
Almost all the games mechanics in the first level sequelitis had a great episode on that

195
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:40,588
God of war where you take down a boss in the first level

196
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:45,174
We're using one button and that makes you feel super powerful and portal which is my favorite game

197
00:09:45,174 --> 00:09:50,121
Which is basically a tutorial the whole thing, but it doesn't feel like one. That's why it's so good

198
00:09:51,912 --> 00:09:57,196
Now, there are some challenges, for example, real-time strategy games are a bit harder

199
00:09:57,196 --> 00:10:04,321
to teach the mechanics of, so what you would do in a case like this is handcraft like a

200
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:10,545
single-player campaign, which is what most games do, most RTS games do.

201
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:15,049
For example, in my game, in Move or Die, it's a four-player party game where the rules change

202
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,030
every 20 seconds.

203
00:10:16,546 --> 00:10:21,355
and I had to make sure that all the players sitting on the same couch know the rules of the game

204
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:22,718
without making it annoying.

205
00:10:23,488 --> 00:10:25,769
And the way I did that is by showing this.

206
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:29,970
It's the rules of the game mode in one sentence,

207
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,892
and also a little animation in case you don't like reading.

208
00:10:32,892 --> 00:10:35,033
Now, the thing is, I had to make sure the players know how

209
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:38,614
much time they have left to read this info

210
00:10:38,614 --> 00:10:40,955
and to understand it before it disappears.

211
00:10:40,955 --> 00:10:43,616
Because if I allow any player to skip this,

212
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:45,197
there might be players who are left out

213
00:10:45,197 --> 00:10:46,877
because they didn't get to read it.

214
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:49,318
Or if I don't allow players to skip it,

215
00:10:49,318 --> 00:10:51,239
those who already know the rules will get bored.

216
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:58,279
So the way I did this is I added the information at the bottom of the screen and I made it

217
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,726
slowly move upwards so the player knows subconsciously.

218
00:11:02,142 --> 00:11:05,364
how much time he has to read this before it's gone,

219
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,226
because once it reaches the top, it's gonna disappear.

220
00:11:08,226 --> 00:11:12,710
And that's basically allowing you to focus

221
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,212
on the contents of the rules without having to worry

222
00:11:16,212 --> 00:11:18,033
that, oh God, it's gonna disappear,

223
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:20,615
because we have all been on the subway

224
00:11:20,615 --> 00:11:22,156
next to somebody who's reading a newspaper,

225
00:11:22,156 --> 00:11:23,677
and you're trying to read it as well,

226
00:11:23,677 --> 00:11:25,178
and you read it really fast because you're afraid

227
00:11:25,178 --> 00:11:25,899
they're gonna turn the page.

228
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,720
It's that feeling, and it's horrible.

229
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:30,752
Alternatively, the bad way of doing this

230
00:11:30,752 --> 00:11:33,874
would be to have like a time left progress bar, which

231
00:11:33,874 --> 00:11:38,215
would be horrible because it would put your attention

232
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:41,596
on that instead of the actual contents.

233
00:11:41,596 --> 00:11:42,677
So yes, testing tutorials.

234
00:11:42,677 --> 00:11:45,898
This is really weird because you have to basically go

235
00:11:45,898 --> 00:11:48,179
through friends because you have to make

236
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:50,139
sure those who test your tutorial have never

237
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:50,880
tried your game before.

238
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:56,178
And a very important thing, don't be a backseat gamer

239
00:11:56,178 --> 00:11:57,318
when somebody tests your game.

240
00:11:57,318 --> 00:12:00,159
Don't try to explain what's happening, what's going on.

241
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,680
Let the game work on its own because you won't be there

242
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,421
when people play the game in their own house.

243
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:08,361
And just a little side note,

244
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,522
when somebody's giving you feedback on your tutorial

245
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,802
or on your game overall, just take it in

246
00:12:12,802 --> 00:12:14,363
and figure out what to do with it later.

247
00:12:14,363 --> 00:12:17,263
Don't try to justify why things are the way they are.

248
00:12:17,978 --> 00:12:18,479
take it all in.

249
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:21,041
Attention span.

250
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,403
Now, if you were working on a game like 10 years ago,

251
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:25,064
you could probably assume that the player will

252
00:12:25,064 --> 00:12:26,525
spend some time with it.

253
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:30,168
But nowadays, if your tutorial annoys the player,

254
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:32,169
he'll just close the game and move to the other one

255
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,011
because there are so many games nowadays,

256
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:37,854
and it's so easy to get distracted.

257
00:12:37,854 --> 00:12:40,355
So even the first few minutes of the game

258
00:12:40,355 --> 00:12:41,656
have to be very, very engaging.

259
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,954
For example, I come from a browser games background,

260
00:12:44,954 --> 00:12:46,375
from Flash games background,

261
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,556
and this is one game that I worked on

262
00:12:48,556 --> 00:12:51,038
in which you control two characters at the same time.

263
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,060
the small character with WASD and the big character

264
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,601
by clicking on the screen to move him.

265
00:12:56,601 --> 00:12:58,922
And I tried so many ways to teach the players this

266
00:12:58,922 --> 00:13:00,902
and nothing worked, nobody understood it.

267
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:03,383
And then I kind of gave up and I did this,

268
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:07,484
which I'm not really proud of, but hey, it works.

269
00:13:07,484 --> 00:13:10,065
And yes, in Flash games, even if the loading screen

270
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:12,746
is bothering the player, they'll just close the tab.

271
00:13:12,746 --> 00:13:15,267
So another thing to keep in mind, game literacy.

272
00:13:15,267 --> 00:13:18,788
This is the assumption you make as a developer.

273
00:13:19,414 --> 00:13:22,135
of how much the player knows about games in general.

274
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:24,036
So for example, you can assume that the player

275
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:26,637
doesn't know anything, and you have to teach them

276
00:13:26,637 --> 00:13:29,098
everything from looking around with the mouse

277
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:33,480
or moving around with WASD, which is what Overwatch does.

278
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,782
Or you can be like Pledis Inside,

279
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,923
where they assume you know everything

280
00:13:38,923 --> 00:13:40,124
and they don't tell you anything.

281
00:13:40,124 --> 00:13:42,105
This is the first thing you see when you open the game.

282
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:45,941
and you have to figure out that you move with the joystick.

283
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:47,123
They don't tell you anything.

284
00:13:47,123 --> 00:13:49,806
There are no prompts on the screen.

285
00:13:49,806 --> 00:13:52,930
And in my point of view, this makes the game better.

286
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,273
For example, in here, they could easily tell you,

287
00:13:55,273 --> 00:13:57,475
press A to jump, but they don't do that.

288
00:13:57,475 --> 00:13:59,498
They allow you to figure it out on your own,

289
00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:01,861
and it makes the game more moody.

290
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:02,521
It's better.

291
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:04,676
because it benefits the game.

292
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:07,639
There's also the option of no tutorials.

293
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,041
Now, it's not written in stone

294
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,424
that all games need to have a tutorial.

295
00:14:12,424 --> 00:14:13,865
For example, Starseed Pilgrim,

296
00:14:13,865 --> 00:14:15,627
it's a game where it doesn't tell you

297
00:14:15,627 --> 00:14:17,149
what to do on purpose.

298
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:18,050
It's about mystery.

299
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:21,053
It's about figuring out how the game works,

300
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:22,995
and the game is better because of this.

301
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:25,537
Also, Pokemon Go.

302
00:14:25,537 --> 00:14:28,759
Now, let's not discuss if it's finished or not,

303
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:29,620
because it's not even 1.0 yet,

304
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,622
but the thing is, for example,

305
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,723
I didn't know that I can spin the ball

306
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:36,524
or how the Pokemon tracker worked.

307
00:14:36,524 --> 00:14:38,285
And these are things that I found out

308
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:40,347
from other players in the real world

309
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,768
that came up to me and explained these mechanics to me.

310
00:14:43,297 --> 00:14:45,539
And that made the game better for me.

311
00:14:45,539 --> 00:14:48,381
It encouraged the social aspect of the game.

312
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:51,144
And then I explained those things to other players.

313
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:53,927
So regardless if they designed it like that or not,

314
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:56,509
it made the game better from my point of view.

315
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:04,471
So, in case you have like very weird mechanics, you can still make things easy to understand

316
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,593
without simplifying your mechanics.

317
00:15:06,593 --> 00:15:08,595
And you do this by using standards.

318
00:15:08,595 --> 00:15:13,241
Now, we all know green is good, red is bad.

319
00:15:13,241 --> 00:15:15,002
We all know that lava is bad.

320
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:17,005
You don't have to tell the player to avoid it.

321
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:18,306
It's very instinctive.

322
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:22,851
In case you're making an interface,

323
00:15:22,851 --> 00:15:25,695
red is usually used for health, blue is for mana.

324
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,817
Some developers use green for health

325
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:28,758
and blue is still mana,

326
00:15:28,758 --> 00:15:30,860
unless you're making an anime fighter,

327
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,662
in which case you just use all the colors there are.

328
00:15:33,522 --> 00:15:34,462
Or Spider-Man.

329
00:15:34,462 --> 00:15:37,402
But yeah, anyway, we take this for granted.

330
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:39,583
And the player already knows that red is bad.

331
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:43,764
And you can even take these standards

332
00:15:43,764 --> 00:15:47,364
and flip them on their head to make fun of the player

333
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,125
if your game allows you to do that.

334
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:50,665
And it makes the experience better.

335
00:15:50,665 --> 00:15:53,145
Other cool things.

336
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:55,126
Key standards.

337
00:15:55,126 --> 00:15:57,266
Now, we all know that in a shooter, for example,

338
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:58,387
you move with double ESD.

339
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:02,450
E is the use key, F is flashlight,

340
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,275
control is crouch, and yes,

341
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:09,537
unlike colors, please don't change this.

342
00:16:09,537 --> 00:16:11,558
Please keep these standards,

343
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:14,441
because otherwise you will end up with something like this,

344
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:17,844
which you don't want to do because it's very weird.

345
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:23,149
So yeah, you can use all these to make your games

346
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,350
more engaging, basically.

347
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:28,174
Directing attention.

348
00:16:28,174 --> 00:16:31,536
Now, tutorials aren't only about teaching mechanics.

349
00:16:31,536 --> 00:16:34,437
They're also about navigating a space,

350
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:37,778
or basically directing where the player will go next.

351
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:40,379
And for that, we can use things like contrast.

352
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:43,160
All the games use this, and it's super, super effective

353
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,381
because it's very subtle.

354
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:48,703
It's not like an arrow pointing where you have to go.

355
00:16:48,703 --> 00:16:50,343
For example, in this screenshot,

356
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,124
you already know where you're gonna go next

357
00:16:52,124 --> 00:16:53,484
strictly because of the lighting.

358
00:16:53,484 --> 00:16:56,906
Other games do it more directly by using cables.

359
00:16:58,345 --> 00:17:01,465
For example, in The Witness, you solve digital puzzles

360
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:02,626
and they're connected by cables.

361
00:17:02,626 --> 00:17:05,186
And once you solve one, the cable lights up,

362
00:17:05,186 --> 00:17:07,327
leading you to the next puzzle.

363
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,927
So if your game allows, Portal does the same thing,

364
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:13,028
you should do this because it's a more direct way

365
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:17,249
to tell the player where to go.

366
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:19,309
Other games are like super blunt about it

367
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:21,069
and they just have a magical flying orb

368
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,230
telling you where to go.

369
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:24,594
So yeah, other things.

370
00:17:24,594 --> 00:17:25,355
Localization.

371
00:17:25,355 --> 00:17:28,016
Now I'm not talking about translating your game,

372
00:17:28,016 --> 00:17:30,917
but we've all played PlayStation games.

373
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:34,198
We all know that X is confirm and circle is back.

374
00:17:34,198 --> 00:17:36,239
But have you ever played a Japanese game

375
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:39,140
and figured out that they're flipped around

376
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,461
and you were very confused for a few minutes like I was?

377
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:46,003
So yes, things might be the same everywhere.

378
00:17:46,003 --> 00:17:48,464
So keep in mind where your game will be played.

379
00:17:49,387 --> 00:17:52,768
take all these things into consideration.

380
00:17:52,768 --> 00:17:56,409
Controllers are another very interesting thing

381
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,549
to make your game more intuitive.

382
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:59,289
For example, a trigger on a controller

383
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:01,210
feels like pulling a trigger on a gun

384
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,730
or like accelerating a vehicle.

385
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,351
The Wiimote is designed to be used as a sword,

386
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:08,852
and many games take advantage of that.

387
00:18:09,687 --> 00:18:13,909
And VR controllers, they open up so many possibilities.

388
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:15,889
For example, this is something I really like

389
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:17,530
from Hover Junkers.

390
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,271
It's a game where you reload your revolver

391
00:18:20,271 --> 00:18:22,692
by pressing the trackpad.

392
00:18:22,692 --> 00:18:24,153
You rotate your thumb on the trackpad,

393
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:25,173
so you put the bullets in,

394
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:27,815
and you just slap the chamber back in,

395
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,196
which is a very intuitive thing to do.

396
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:31,676
You don't have to tell the player,

397
00:18:31,676 --> 00:18:33,237
press X to reload.

398
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,422
For example, when I got the Oculus Touch controllers,

399
00:18:37,422 --> 00:18:40,465
the first time I got them, I looked at the thumbsticks

400
00:18:40,465 --> 00:18:43,449
and I noticed that the surface is shiny and I was like.

401
00:18:44,018 --> 00:18:45,599
That's horrible, who would do such a thing?

402
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,959
But then I realized that they're actually

403
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:51,900
capacitive surfaces that are also used on the triggers.

404
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,701
And us developers can use those to figure out

405
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:57,301
if the finger is touching that surface or not.

406
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:59,822
And based on that alone, we can allow the player

407
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:04,022
to do very intuitive gestures without pressing any button,

408
00:19:04,022 --> 00:19:05,623
just by moving their hands.

409
00:19:05,623 --> 00:19:08,383
So things like these are super exciting for the future

410
00:19:08,383 --> 00:19:12,244
and for designing more intuitive tutorials.

411
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:19,014
And VR in general is super interesting because, for example, in Fruit Ninja, they don't have

412
00:19:19,014 --> 00:19:20,815
to teach you how to swing a sword.

413
00:19:20,815 --> 00:19:22,336
You already know how to do that.

414
00:19:22,336 --> 00:19:23,857
It's intuitive.

415
00:19:23,857 --> 00:19:28,320
In Space Pirate Trainer, they don't have to teach you how to avoid bullets.

416
00:19:28,733 --> 00:19:32,474
it's very intrinsic that when you see a projectile coming towards you,

417
00:19:32,474 --> 00:19:36,395
you lean in the other direction, and that's a mechanic of the game.

418
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:39,717
And that's why it's so natural to interact with things in VR, because

419
00:19:39,717 --> 00:19:44,098
once you remap the hands in the virtual world, you just

420
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:46,379
interact naturally with everything around you.

421
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,422
For more traditional kind of text or buttons,

422
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,744
they are usually mapped on the controller,

423
00:19:52,744 --> 00:19:55,146
so they follow your controller.

424
00:19:55,146 --> 00:19:56,667
And the interesting thing about VR

425
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,989
is that in traditional games, you would usually

426
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:02,311
tell the player the goal and how to get to the goal.

427
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:04,553
Now, in VR, you don't necessarily have to do that.

428
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:05,414
For example, in a

429
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:11,960
in budget cuts, they don't tell you press the trigger to grab an object, they just tell you

430
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,725
try picking stuff up. And you do that naturally, because it feels natural. So that's super,

431
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:23,131
super interesting. As well as even better, closing things and interacting with things

432
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:28,856
just by touching them without pressing any button, like closing a drawer with your forehead.

433
00:20:28,856 --> 00:20:31,418
That's amazing. But yeah, teach.

434
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:40,237
gradually through experience. Now, uh, I want you to think about a really, really great tutorial,

435
00:20:40,237 --> 00:20:45,618
like a mind-blowing tutorial that you, you played, most likely one that I haven't mentioned

436
00:20:45,618 --> 00:20:51,119
here, and uh, and think about that and think what made that tutorial great. Now, you might

437
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:56,380
have some trouble doing that, like I did, because the conclusion of this talk and the

438
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,922
conclusion I reached is the best tutorial is the one nobody remembers.

439
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:16,008
Thank you.

440
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:21,071
So I'm not sure how we are on time, but do we have time for any questions?

441
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,352
Are we good on time?

442
00:21:22,352 --> 00:21:25,354
We have five minutes for questions, so shoot away.

443
00:21:38,445 --> 00:21:39,225
Cool, no questions.

444
00:21:39,225 --> 00:21:40,405
It means I addressed everything.

445
00:21:40,405 --> 00:21:41,006
Oh, there's a question.

446
00:21:41,006 --> 00:21:42,726
Is there a microphone that we can get there?

447
00:21:42,726 --> 00:21:42,986
It's coming.

448
00:21:42,986 --> 00:21:43,286
Wait for it.

449
00:21:43,286 --> 00:21:44,307
Sorry, Vault viewers, this is taking forever.

450
00:21:44,307 --> 00:21:44,887
That was complicated.

451
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:44,987
Hello.

452
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:45,047
Hi.

453
00:21:45,047 --> 00:21:45,667
Thank you very much for the talk.

454
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:46,307
It was very interesting.

455
00:21:46,307 --> 00:21:46,507
I just have.

456
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:16,100
A little question in terms of environmental design, you know when people are building the whole thing

457
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:22,084
The level or the open world for example, how would you like to how would you like address the issue of?

458
00:22:22,084 --> 00:22:23,525
Navigating the player you mentioned

459
00:22:24,064 --> 00:22:28,267
nice examples with contrast and with the shiny wires and everything

460
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:32,590
but maybe there are some more ways that you could use, you know,

461
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,832
the environment to guide the player, how to move and so on.

462
00:22:35,832 --> 00:22:39,514
Thank you. Yeah, so there are a lot of ways to direct the player within

463
00:22:39,514 --> 00:22:42,937
a level through level design by maybe shaping objects like

464
00:22:42,937 --> 00:22:46,559
arrows or having or using a lot of color

465
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,901
like Mirror's Edge, for example, like the Runner's Vision.

466
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,483
And there are a lot of ways of doing that.

467
00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:58,168
And I would say contrast is the most used one because it's so easy to use and it's so

468
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,950
subtle.

469
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:04,353
But overall, I would say tutorials is mostly level design.

470
00:23:04,353 --> 00:23:06,175
Like, that's the most important part because...

471
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:10,111
As I mentioned, Half-Life 2, most of the things

472
00:23:10,111 --> 00:23:12,593
you learn there is through level design.

473
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:14,114
So not like UI elements.

474
00:23:14,114 --> 00:23:16,675
So that's why level design is super interesting.

475
00:23:16,675 --> 00:23:20,258
But I can't really think of that many other ways

476
00:23:20,258 --> 00:23:22,899
of directing the player around, even though I'm

477
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:24,580
sure there are tons of them.

478
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,621
Thank you very much.

479
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:25,921
Thank you.

480
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,862
Yeah, thanks. Great talk. My question is, what do you think of prologues for tutorials?

481
00:23:37,862 --> 00:23:39,303
Of what?

482
00:23:39,303 --> 00:23:45,306
Prologues, so that you start the game with something very interesting, like a big bang that really...

483
00:23:45,306 --> 00:23:49,468
that tries to get into the people's mind that they really wow them.

484
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,051
Yeah, no, that's great.

485
00:23:51,051 --> 00:23:53,612
And that's basically what God of War

486
00:23:53,612 --> 00:23:56,192
did when they let you take down a whole boss

487
00:23:56,192 --> 00:24:00,094
by using one button, which makes the player input very easy.

488
00:24:00,094 --> 00:24:02,454
But what's on screen is very impressive.

489
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:04,135
And yes, you're encouraged to do that,

490
00:24:04,135 --> 00:24:07,236
as long as that doesn't imply giving mechanics

491
00:24:07,236 --> 00:24:08,476
that you then take away.

492
00:24:08,476 --> 00:24:10,957
Because that feels like dangling a carrot in front

493
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:12,558
of the player and be like, hey, look

494
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:15,879
at all these awesome things that you will play with, but later.

495
00:24:15,879 --> 00:24:17,559
And then you take them away.

496
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:18,560
So yeah, that's encouraged.

497
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:23,166
Thanks.

498
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:23,347
Hi.

499
00:24:23,347 --> 00:24:23,807
Hello.

500
00:24:23,807 --> 00:24:24,167
Thank you.

501
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:27,128
Spectacular presentation.

502
00:24:27,128 --> 00:24:27,408
Thank you.

503
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:30,049
What do you think, or how would you

504
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:32,070
introduce item shops or currency shops

505
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,891
in free-to-play mobile games?

506
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:36,892
Because they are often part of the tutorial,

507
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,393
and I think there's no good way.

508
00:24:39,393 --> 00:24:42,694
Right, so I don't think it's.

509
00:24:43,803 --> 00:24:46,284
I don't think it's necessarily a thing with mobile games

510
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,404
or free-to-play games, but you're

511
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,405
talking about a UI element, like introducing a mechanic

512
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:52,606
through the UI.

513
00:24:52,606 --> 00:24:54,126
And basically, the secret of that

514
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:57,587
is what I kept saying, teach things gradually.

515
00:24:57,587 --> 00:24:59,608
So for example, if you have a piece of UI

516
00:24:59,608 --> 00:25:02,369
that is not used right away, don't show that.

517
00:25:02,369 --> 00:25:04,829
And teach, show a very bare-bones version

518
00:25:04,829 --> 00:25:09,291
of the UI where the player can navigate it really easily,

519
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:11,812
and then gradually introduce more and more things.

520
00:25:12,487 --> 00:25:15,349
You can direct the player through the UI

521
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:20,333
as well by having elements of it flash or animate subtly.

522
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:22,775
Please just don't use huge arrows, like press on this,

523
00:25:22,775 --> 00:25:23,335
now press on this.

524
00:25:23,335 --> 00:25:25,116
But it's like the secret of all tutorials

525
00:25:25,116 --> 00:25:26,677
is to teach things gradually.

526
00:25:26,677 --> 00:25:28,018
And yes, I think that's all the time we had.

527
00:25:28,018 --> 00:25:28,679
And thank you again.
