00:00:04,965 --> 00:00:08,389
Good afternoon, GDC.

2
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:10,971
GDC 2010, all right!

3
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:12,372
Best GDC ever.

4
00:00:12,372 --> 00:00:20,540
Good afternoon, and welcome to Among Friends, an Uncharted 2

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,762
Among Thieves post-mortem.

6
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:28,647
Please set your mobile devices to mute, and don't forget to

7
00:00:28,647 --> 00:00:30,689
fill out your feedback forms at the end of the session.

8
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:31,390
Thanks.

9
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:36,556
My name is Richard Lemarchand and I'm a game designer at Naughty Dog.

10
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:42,181
I was the co-lead designer of Uncharted 2 Among Thieves

11
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:48,128
and today I'm going to talk you through how we went about developing our game,

12
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:52,973
what went right, and what blew up in our faces like a red explosive barrel.

13
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:05,816
As you might know, Naughty Dog, our studio, is the creator of the multi-million selling Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter series of games.

14
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:11,239
We're based in Santa Monica in Southern California, and we currently have about 120 people on staff.

15
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:22,265
In 2007, we released Uncharted Drake's Fortune, our first game for the PlayStation 3, which introduced the world to the adventurous fortune hunter Nathan Drake.

16
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:26,056
And last fall we released Uncharted 2 Among Thieves,

17
00:01:26,056 --> 00:01:31,279
which has turned out to be the most successful game in our studio's history.

18
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:36,182
Now we'd had a rough ride on Uncharted Drake's Fortune,

19
00:01:36,182 --> 00:01:41,865
including a mid-project production reset that saw us throwing away a lot of what we'd done

20
00:01:41,865 --> 00:01:46,127
and starting over. We were very happy with the game that resulted,

21
00:01:46,127 --> 00:01:49,028
but with our next game we wanted to do a lot more.

22
00:01:50,994 --> 00:01:56,177
Well, we got what we wished for because Uncharted 2 was the most ambitious project we'd ever

23
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:57,277
attempted at Naughty Dog.

24
00:01:57,277 --> 00:02:03,480
And we chose to tackle some particularly brutal challenges, both technical and design-related.

25
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,441
So how did we manage not to screw it up?

26
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:12,284
Well, there were some things that we nearly did screw up, and hopefully this post-mortem

27
00:02:12,284 --> 00:02:17,606
will help you to avoid at least some of the spiky-ceilinged pit traps that we fell into.

28
00:02:21,362 --> 00:02:27,187
So we start every new project with a short list of project goals and we refer back to

29
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:30,410
them throughout development to make sure that we're staying on track.

30
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,714
As we completed Uncharted Drake's Fortune, we already knew that we wanted to make a sequel

31
00:02:35,714 --> 00:02:38,037
and we began to discuss what we wanted to do with it.

32
00:02:39,907 --> 00:02:44,190
Our top line goal was that we really wanted to create something that a lot of us at the

33
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,732
studio had been dreaming about for a really long time.

34
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:53,237
That is to say a fully playable version of a big summer blockbuster action-adventure

35
00:02:53,237 --> 00:02:59,522
movie which kept the player in moment-to-moment control nearly all the time as the drama exploded

36
00:02:59,522 --> 00:03:00,202
around them.

37
00:03:02,817 --> 00:03:07,680
When we were making Uncharted Drake's Fortune, we'd gone back to the roots of adventure romance

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,843
and pulp fiction for our inspiration, kind of giving them a contemporary spin.

39
00:03:12,843 --> 00:03:17,566
Well, this time out, we wanted to stick to the same guiding principles for the world of Uncharted

40
00:03:17,566 --> 00:03:23,329
in terms of creating a colorful adventure that didn't take itself too seriously,

41
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,451
but we also wanted to outdo ourselves in every way that we could think of.

42
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:32,754
Our story in Uncharted is character-driven rather than plot-driven,

43
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,837
and we decided to include a larger cast of characters in Uncharted 2.

44
00:03:36,837 --> 00:03:43,021
The other characters would help us to show more of the world that Nate operates in,

45
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:45,663
and would act kind of like emotional satellites,

46
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:49,806
revealing more about both the good and the darker sides of Nate's character.

47
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:56,370
So going through the process of discussing the goals of the project

48
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,314
led us to decide what Uncharted 2 would be about.

49
00:04:01,314 --> 00:04:06,899
While Uncharted Drake's fortune had greed and its consequences as its theme,

50
00:04:06,899 --> 00:04:10,422
Uncharted 2 Among Thieves would be about trust and betrayal

51
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:14,325
and whether it's better to stay loyal to your friends

52
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:16,087
or to act out of self-interest.

53
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:22,968
We were going to improve and add to the gameplay of Uncharted, of course, in a focused way

54
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:27,611
that would service this playable cinema feel that we wanted to capture, and which would

55
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:32,733
drive many different technological improvements in our engine.

56
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:37,216
We also knew that there were a lot of graphical improvements that we could make.

57
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:42,459
And finally, we wanted to make an online multiplayer game using the Uncharted mechanics.

58
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:47,741
We knew that, at the very least, we wanted to make a competitive game with several different

59
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:48,062
game types.

60
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:55,278
So, armed with our project goals, we set out into the pre-production phase of our project,

61
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:59,620
which lasted for about the first six months of our 22-month development cycle.

62
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:05,364
Pre-production is, of course, a very important phase of any game development endeavour,

63
00:05:05,364 --> 00:05:08,285
and messing it up often means messing up the whole project.

64
00:05:09,783 --> 00:05:15,069
The way that we handle pre-production at Naughty Dog is one of the things that we think makes us unusual as a studio

65
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:21,877
in that during pre-production, we don't have anything in the way of conventional deadlines or deliverables.

66
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:28,960
Our pre-production period is this very free form time where we conduct brainstorms, we

67
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,623
talk about gameplay and story ideas, we make loads of concept art and pre-visualization

68
00:05:33,623 --> 00:05:39,527
animations and we do as much prototyping of gameplay as we can with whatever tools that

69
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:41,648
we happen to have on hand.

70
00:05:41,648 --> 00:05:44,290
And I'll show you some of our previous animations in a few minutes.

71
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:49,353
So by doing this we pretty quickly come up with a handful of ideas that are simply too

72
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:51,474
good not to include in the game.

73
00:05:53,923 --> 00:05:58,425
One such idea that came to us very early was embodied in a simple photograph,

74
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,347
that of the Paro Takt Stang,

75
00:06:01,347 --> 00:06:05,969
the famous Tiger's Nest Monastery in the tiny country of Bhutan,

76
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:08,050
at the eastern end of the Himalayas.

77
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:13,592
The way that the monastery seems to cling on to the side of the cliff

78
00:06:13,592 --> 00:06:15,373
seems perfect for Uncharted.

79
00:06:16,998 --> 00:06:21,920
So the photo gave us a good grounding in reality for the larger than life scenario that we

80
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:28,923
invented and it was also suggestive of the kind of perilous climbing gameplay that we

81
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:29,703
love so much.

82
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:34,546
So we soon began to design and build a level based on the tiger's nest, long before we

83
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:38,287
had any real idea of how it fit into the rest of the game.

84
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:41,208
And there's a cautionary tale in there which I'll tell in a moment.

85
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:48,168
Another idea that came to us early in pre-production was the notion that Drake would fight along

86
00:06:48,168 --> 00:06:55,130
the top of a train as it sped through a landscape. The idea was such a perfect fit with the pulp-inspired

87
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:00,271
tone of Uncharted that we knew that we had to do it, and this piece of concept art illustrated

88
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:06,653
the idea for us just perfectly. However, we didn't want to go the same route that train

89
00:07:06,653 --> 00:07:10,014
levels in video games had taken in the past.

90
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:15,639
where the train is actually static and the background is scrolling by creating the illusion

91
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:22,124
of movement. We wanted to do it for real and that gives me a chance to describe how gameplay

92
00:07:22,124 --> 00:07:27,429
ideas like these in pre-production can drive the technology path that we take. So the desire

93
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:33,494
to create this level, which was one of the first that we conceived and one of the last

94
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:38,178
that we completed, drove an enormous chunk of the new technology we created for Uncharted 2.

95
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,682
technology that became very important for the cinematic set pieces

96
00:07:42,682 --> 00:07:49,865
throughout the whole game. We called it our dynamic objects traversal system.

97
00:07:49,865 --> 00:07:52,246
Anyone? Anyone?

98
00:07:52,246 --> 00:07:56,248
This system provided us with the ability to have

99
00:07:56,248 --> 00:08:01,511
player character Nathan Drake and all of his allies and enemies in the game

100
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:04,713
able to use all of their traversal and combat abilities

101
00:08:04,713 --> 00:08:06,313
on any moving object.

102
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:11,930
Now this might not seem like a big deal, but for those of us who had been working on 3D

103
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:19,512
character action games for a while, it was pretty much the holy grail, because it would

104
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:21,753
allow us to do things that we had only been able to dream of before.

105
00:08:21,753 --> 00:08:26,514
It was amazingly complicated to get this dynamic object traversal system to work.

106
00:08:26,514 --> 00:08:31,415
Our programmers had to touch or rewrite nearly every system in the game, from the player

107
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:35,417
control to objects, to collision, to the enemies and allies AI.

108
00:08:36,713 --> 00:08:41,376
Once we decided to do it though, our programmers got to work on it straight away

109
00:08:41,376 --> 00:08:47,559
and they were already busy with it while we were in pre-production, finally

110
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,660
finishing it partway through full production.

111
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,663
Taking the leap to do something like this, as crazy as this,

112
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:56,324
took a lot of tenacity and courage

113
00:08:56,324 --> 00:09:00,066
and we had to keep going even when it felt like an impossible task.

114
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:02,908
But happily it paid off in countless ways.

115
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:08,881
from the collapsing hotel to the convoy, Uncharted 2 was able to stand out from the crowd and

116
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,524
wow our players with things that they'd just never seen before.

117
00:09:12,524 --> 00:09:20,932
One more idea that emerged from pre-production was that of Nate collapsing in the snow and

118
00:09:20,932 --> 00:09:26,756
being rescued by a mysterious stranger that for a long time we just called the Rescuer.

119
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:32,148
Nate would then wake up in a peaceful Himalayan village and discover that his

120
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:34,970
savior was a village leader named Tenzin

121
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,352
and that they didn't share a common language.

122
00:09:37,352 --> 00:09:41,935
We planned that Nate would leave the village with Tenzin to explore a

123
00:09:41,935 --> 00:09:44,297
puzzling mountain cave system

124
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:46,498
before returning to the village

125
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:49,900
now, to a village now under attack by a very well-equipped army.

126
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,684
We thought that this would create a particular sequence of emotional

127
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:55,724
experience

128
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:56,385
for the player.

129
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,237
almost entirely through gameplay.

130
00:09:59,237 --> 00:10:03,361
And even though much of the rest of the story was still undecided, we were able

131
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:07,886
to stick a pin in this idea and proceed, confident that it would find a home in

132
00:10:07,886 --> 00:10:08,727
the game.

133
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:13,632
Now you can hear much more about these kinds of techniques and how we used

134
00:10:13,632 --> 00:10:18,757
gameplay and allied characters to create emotional experiences for the player

135
00:10:18,757 --> 00:10:20,859
by heading over to tomorrow's session.

136
00:10:21,657 --> 00:10:24,659
uh... creating the active cinematic experience of uncharted 2

137
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:27,901
by our game director Bruce Straley

138
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:32,244
and my co-lead designer Neil Druckmann. It's going to be excellent, don't miss it.

139
00:10:32,244 --> 00:10:38,289
So as our list of ideas grew, we experimented with putting them together

140
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:39,129
in different orders

141
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:42,532
to see what kinds of story ideas would emerge.

142
00:10:43,313 --> 00:10:48,757
We used a board full of index cards with story beats and character goals and gameplay moments

143
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:54,281
that we could move around easily to try on different sequences of play.

144
00:10:54,281 --> 00:11:00,305
So with a lot of conversation, lots and lots of in-depth research into places and history,

145
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:06,089
and then with a great deal of careful thought and hard analytical work, sequences of storytelling

146
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:07,710
gameplay started to come together.

147
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,253
And we soon had big chunks of the game figured out.

148
00:11:13,603 --> 00:11:18,326
Now this is how we create one of the most important documents of the project

149
00:11:18,326 --> 00:11:21,607
and the only deliverable for our pre-production period.

150
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:25,529
It's a short spreadsheet, you can see part of it here,

151
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:28,350
that we call our macro design.

152
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,033
So the macro design is basically a list of the game's levels

153
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:34,793
and corresponding story beats.

154
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:38,106
It shows the locations that the game will visit,

155
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:40,127
what play mechanics are used in each level,

156
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:44,591
and whether they're core mechanics or special gameplay sequences

157
00:11:44,591 --> 00:11:45,992
like, say, a vehicle sequence.

158
00:11:45,992 --> 00:11:47,272
It shows the enemies that the player will encounter

159
00:11:47,272 --> 00:11:49,734
and what allies will accompany Drake on each stage of his journey.

160
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:53,237
The macro also showed us that we would have a focus on Asia as a location for much of the story.

161
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:03,754
that the true story of Marco Polo's lost fleet

162
00:12:03,754 --> 00:12:07,317
would provide us with our real-life historical mystery for the game

163
00:12:07,317 --> 00:12:10,760
and that the plot would hinge around an old friend of Nathan Drake's

164
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,741
who would ultimately betray him.

165
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:13,423
So the macro is something like a game design document.

166
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:23,075
But it's a lot more concrete than any 100-page game design

167
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,956
ever written at the end of pre-production, because it has

168
00:12:25,956 --> 00:12:28,477
enough of a level of abstraction that you don't

169
00:12:28,477 --> 00:12:31,798
waste time devising details that later get changed.

170
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:37,841
The macro design for Uncharted 2 was only 70 rows long, and

171
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,282
it shows the structure of the game that we shipped a full

172
00:12:40,282 --> 00:12:43,344
year and a half later, almost exactly to within 5% or 10%.

173
00:12:47,415 --> 00:12:53,977
So as we progressed through pre-production, there were a couple of other important gameplay systems that we decided to get busy with.

174
00:12:53,977 --> 00:13:00,058
There were a few gaps and spaces in the play mechanics of Uncharted Drake's Fortune.

175
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:11,202
So for Uncharted 2, we gave Nate some new mechanics to fill things out, like brachiating on monkey bars, swinging on free ropes, and a nifty new hand-over-hand free climbing ability.

176
00:13:13,852 --> 00:13:18,061
We also wanted Nate to be able to pull out his gun and return fire to an enemy

177
00:13:18,061 --> 00:13:19,945
no matter what he was doing in the world.

178
00:13:19,945 --> 00:13:22,911
Whether he was climbing, balancing on a fallen beam,

179
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:24,755
and even when he was in mid-air during a jump.

180
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:31,607
It didn't take us very long to flesh out these abilities and expanding Drake's traversal gunplay like this

181
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:35,049
was good for us when it came to devising combat scenarios

182
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:40,532
because it meant that we could throw down some enemies in just any section of the game

183
00:13:40,532 --> 00:13:45,875
and in that way discover novel combat setups in the most unexpected traversal sequences.

184
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:54,764
We also started work early in pre-production on improvements to our AI that let players

185
00:13:54,764 --> 00:14:00,386
choose to engage with our combat setups in an action stealth way.

186
00:14:00,386 --> 00:14:05,189
In order to let players hide out and observe the enemies and figure out how to possibly

187
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:06,429
infiltrate their ranks.

188
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:10,847
and even manipulate them into positions that would make them easier to defeat.

189
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:13,809
We gave our enemies an investigate behavior

190
00:14:13,809 --> 00:14:18,451
that they would use when they thought they'd heard or seen something unusual

191
00:14:18,451 --> 00:14:20,112
and also a search behavior

192
00:14:20,112 --> 00:14:22,153
that they would use when they had seen Drake

193
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,014
but they didn't currently know where he was.

194
00:14:24,014 --> 00:14:29,317
Now these techniques paid off right throughout the whole player experience

195
00:14:29,317 --> 00:14:33,199
so it was really good that we got started on them early during pre-production.

196
00:14:36,137 --> 00:14:41,582
One last important thing for us to do during pre-production was to get a handle on how long it was going to take us

197
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:45,445
to create the big set pieces that we wanted to have in the game.

198
00:14:45,445 --> 00:14:49,549
One particular sequence from Uncharted Drake's Fortune

199
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:52,732
had stuck in our minds and really fired our imaginations.

200
00:14:52,732 --> 00:14:57,676
It was the one you can see here, just a simple sequence at the island waterfall

201
00:14:57,676 --> 00:15:00,619
where an explosion near a truck full of enemies

202
00:15:00,619 --> 00:15:02,400
flips the truck and forms a bridge.

203
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:08,698
It was a really dramatic moment, just like something from one of our favorite action-adventure movies,

204
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:12,019
but it played out almost entirely in gameplay.

205
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:17,800
It made us feel that we had only begun to scratch the surface of what was possible

206
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,321
in terms of delivering a truly interactive cinematic experience.

207
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:28,182
And we thought that making bigger set pieces and moving away from so-called quick-time events

208
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:29,603
was probably a great way to go.

209
00:15:31,878 --> 00:15:38,642
Well, it was a great way to go, and everyone seems to really like the set pieces in Uncharted 2.

210
00:15:38,642 --> 00:15:42,364
However, they are enormously time-consuming to implement.

211
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:53,189
We had foreseen this, and so early on in pre-production, we got busy building a version of the collapsing bridge in the monastery that you encounter towards the end of the game.

212
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:58,732
We confirmed our suspicions about how extremely time-consuming that kind of sequence was to build.

213
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:02,071
and so we hired some very technical scripting designers

214
00:16:02,071 --> 00:16:07,534
trying to make sure that we had enough people to get everything done in time.

215
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:11,457
It didn't quite work out perfectly though, as you'll hear later on.

216
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:17,861
One of the most important things that we had taken away from our post-mortem

217
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:20,042
of Uncharted Drake's fortune

218
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:23,985
was that simply getting on and starting to build something

219
00:16:23,985 --> 00:16:28,107
is the very best way to go about the creation of a video game.

220
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:35,235
We'd spent far too long theorizing about our game's design and production during the creation

221
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:39,639
of the first Uncharted, and it wasn't until we pressed forward with the construction of

222
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:44,323
some gameplay and levels that we made the real discoveries that allowed us to optimize

223
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:46,105
the production and finish the game in good style.

224
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,747
So we did our best to hit the ground running with Uncharted 2.

225
00:16:54,053 --> 00:16:58,315
The team was eager to keep the production momentum that we'd built up over the previous

226
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:01,056
three years working on Uncharted Drake's Fortune.

227
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:06,219
And using the first ideas we decided that we would use, everyone began to create art

228
00:17:06,219 --> 00:17:11,881
and implement game mechanics and layout levels almost immediately.

229
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:16,503
Now this meant that our artists were polishing their level building approach and making useful

230
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:19,165
assets much earlier than they'd been able to before.

231
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:27,530
And by the time we hit full production, we were in a much better position than we had been at the same stage of the last project.

232
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:37,997
However, moving forward so quickly meant that the end of pre-production and the beginning of full production kind of got a bit blurry.

233
00:17:37,997 --> 00:17:43,661
We came to the official end of pre-production when we finished our macro design, but it was something of a soft finish.

234
00:17:44,112 --> 00:17:47,937
The parts of the macro to do with the way that the story came together

235
00:17:47,937 --> 00:17:52,142
at the end of the game were a bit light on detail.

236
00:17:52,142 --> 00:17:55,907
And this led us directly into what could have been

237
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:58,450
an enormous disaster for our project

238
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,952
and which we only narrowly avoided.

239
00:18:02,144 --> 00:18:06,066
It took us a long time to work out how the story would come together,

240
00:18:06,066 --> 00:18:07,847
in the monastery in particular.

241
00:18:07,847 --> 00:18:11,008
And when you play it through, you might notice that there aren't really enough

242
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:12,849
strong story beats there

243
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:16,431
to match the length and the intensity of the gameplay.

244
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:18,372
And it's the first place in the game

245
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:22,054
where the pace of the experience kind of begins to lose steam a bit.

246
00:18:22,054 --> 00:18:27,337
Of course, as soon as we realized what was happening, we scrambled to patch things up.

247
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:31,830
but at the end of the day we had committed too much to the level

248
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,111
in terms of its final art

249
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:36,675
and we couldn't really bring about a perfect fix.

250
00:18:36,675 --> 00:18:41,079
So this is the first major takeaway from this post-mortem of Uncharted 2.

251
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:46,224
That it's important to have a strong macro design.

252
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,724
If the macro is solid and describes a rising and falling rhythm of story

253
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:55,586
that tightly matches the rhythms of the gameplay,

254
00:18:55,586 --> 00:18:59,149
then you can be confident that your game is going to rock.

255
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:01,731
However, if your macro has any weak spots,

256
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:07,015
do make sure you firm them up before you commit too much in the way of

257
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:08,937
final art to that part of the game.

258
00:19:09,577 --> 00:19:13,658
and tried to pay special attention to pacing issues for parts of the game

259
00:19:13,658 --> 00:19:18,299
whose level design starts early and whose story design finishes late.

260
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:23,521
So anyway, to round off the pre-production section of my talk, I want to show you guys

261
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:29,603
what is a world exclusive, especially for GDC.

262
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:35,085
While we were making Uncharted Drake's Fortune, we had learned firsthand about

263
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:36,365
the power of

264
00:19:36,365 --> 00:19:38,746
pre-rendered, pre-visualization animations.

265
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:45,564
By making quickly and loosely animated sequences, pre-rendered linear sequences, with blocky,

266
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:52,306
low detailed worlds and characters, we can very quickly start to refine our ideas, the

267
00:19:52,306 --> 00:19:54,887
kinds of ideas that we've had for moments in the game.

268
00:19:54,887 --> 00:20:01,268
They're kind of like moving concept art, and we refer back to them all throughout the level

269
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:01,728
layout process.

270
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:10,380
Only one of these animations have been seen outside of Sony before, so I'm delighted to

271
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,821
be able to show them to you guys today.

272
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:18,904
The previous animations are silent, and I'll kind of talk you through them, and then we'll

273
00:20:18,904 --> 00:20:24,246
look at some comparative pieces of gameplay from the shipping game.

274
00:20:24,246 --> 00:20:29,087
So this first one is very simple, just to kind of get you into the idea.

275
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,419
I think we were during pre-production when we made this, we knew that we wanted to have

276
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:39,942
this sequence of exploration, we wanted Tenzin to put up a free swinging rope that Drake

277
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:42,824
would then use.

278
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:49,407
And you can see just how much of the camera blocking in particular we discovered in the

279
00:20:49,407 --> 00:20:53,650
process of creating and refining this animation.

280
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,611
Check out Tenzin's awesome hat and pipe.

281
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:23,961
Okay

282
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:32,111
So you can see how we worked out the camera blocking very early very early this one's in two parts we didn't use these

283
00:21:32,111 --> 00:21:33,713
previous

284
00:21:33,713 --> 00:21:34,054
conceptions

285
00:21:34,054 --> 00:21:38,520
Very much. We did use this one Drake taking cover on a corner

286
00:21:38,957 --> 00:21:42,400
which then gets blown up by the tank. We made it so that if you ran directly away

287
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,421
from the tank

288
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:46,644
you would get killed by the tank's machine gun in order to be able to push the player

289
00:21:46,644 --> 00:21:51,408
around the level while still giving them freedom of movement.

290
00:21:51,408 --> 00:21:53,890
But it did really help us start to set the tone for the village.

291
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:58,954
This next sequence you can see much more directly translates into the game.

292
00:21:58,954 --> 00:22:02,497
You can see the ongoing love affair that we have with parkour and free running

293
00:22:02,497 --> 00:22:06,240
and the fact that we've probably recently seen the Bourne ultimatum.

294
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:13,560
And if you played Uncharted 2, you will recognize this moment.

295
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,404
It didn't translate directly, and in fact you'll see that the sequence of play leading up to this...

296
00:23:03,147 --> 00:23:05,047
And then this last one is a little different.

297
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:09,508
This shows the use of previs animatics just ahead

298
00:23:09,508 --> 00:23:10,568
of full production.

299
00:23:10,568 --> 00:23:15,209
We made this one just before we implemented the sequence

300
00:23:15,209 --> 00:23:20,911
in the collapsing hotel, which was part of our E3 Sony press

301
00:23:20,911 --> 00:23:21,691
events demo.

302
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:25,252
And you can see that there's an extremely tight correspondence

303
00:23:25,252 --> 00:23:29,693
between this previsualization and the events of the ship.

304
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:47,953
How was it, Joe?

305
00:23:47,953 --> 00:23:48,795
This isn't good!

306
00:24:24,235 --> 00:24:26,918
was in that.

307
00:24:26,918 --> 00:24:35,765
So hopefully you can see just how valuable these kinds of pre-rendered linear animatic

308
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,345
movies are.

309
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:45,273
It's also extremely cool to involve your talented animators in the pre-production phase, because

310
00:24:45,273 --> 00:24:50,537
of course they have so many great ideas about moment-to-moment action, and you can all start

311
00:24:50,537 --> 00:24:53,159
to have an on-screen discussion about just how.

312
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,253
events in the game might play out.

313
00:24:55,253 --> 00:24:56,234
So we officially started full production

314
00:24:56,234 --> 00:24:57,194
when we finished our macro design in April 2008.

315
00:24:57,194 --> 00:25:01,116
Of course, once we were in full production,

316
00:25:01,116 --> 00:25:06,539
we needed some micro design to go along with our macro design.

317
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:11,881
What we call micro design is all the detailed design work

318
00:25:11,881 --> 00:25:17,884
that needs to be done to create a video game, level layout,

319
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:19,525
mechanics development, and so on.

320
00:25:20,945 --> 00:25:24,668
We do this macro design work on a just-in-time basis.

321
00:25:24,668 --> 00:25:28,672
It's a bit like Gromit laying out the toy train tracks only

322
00:25:28,672 --> 00:25:30,653
just ahead of himself in the wrong trousers.

323
00:25:30,653 --> 00:25:32,715
We had gotten a leg up with the micro design during

324
00:25:32,715 --> 00:25:35,818
pre-production, and we were just far enough ahead of the

325
00:25:35,818 --> 00:25:38,560
team that we were able to move forward smoothly.

326
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,965
Even though this part of the way that we work might seem

327
00:25:43,965 --> 00:25:46,067
like a pretty seat-of-the-pants way to do

328
00:25:46,067 --> 00:25:46,427
things.

329
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:51,309
We think that it's the way that a lot of game development happens in truth,

330
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:55,172
and that we just have the courage to make it an official part of our process.

331
00:25:55,172 --> 00:26:00,335
One very important and time-consuming part of the micro-design is level layout, of course.

332
00:26:00,335 --> 00:26:08,801
Inspired by our philosophy that getting on and building out the game is the best way to go about things,

333
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:11,863
we adopted a new level layout approach for Uncharted 2.

334
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:17,254
that saw us spending less time working on detailed paper maps of our levels

335
00:26:17,254 --> 00:26:22,656
and instead designing our levels by creating what we refer to as block mesh

336
00:26:22,656 --> 00:26:25,297
which some studios refer to as white box or grey box.

337
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:29,199
We started by sketching out an experiential flow for the player

338
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:34,320
and then meeting with the artists and the programmers who would be working on the level with the designers

339
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,121
to get their input and their ideas.

340
00:26:37,476 --> 00:26:43,158
Then we just started building a simple geometry in Maya to rough out a physical footprint

341
00:26:43,158 --> 00:26:48,719
for the level and playtesting it on literally anyone who came within arm's reach and getting

342
00:26:48,719 --> 00:26:51,860
constructive input from as many different people as possible.

343
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:58,343
We started to do paint-overs with our concept artists to move our conception of the look

344
00:26:58,343 --> 00:26:59,163
of the level along.

345
00:27:00,097 --> 00:27:05,201
And after that, it was simply a question of iterating as much and as quickly as we could

346
00:27:05,201 --> 00:27:10,584
before we needed to hand off the block mesh to our environment artists, who would continue

347
00:27:10,584 --> 00:27:17,388
to iterate on the level by making progressive detail passes until we eventually arrive at

348
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:18,329
the finished art.

349
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:23,111
There is one potential downside to rushing ahead with level layout in block mesh like

350
00:27:23,111 --> 00:27:29,415
this, which is that there's a danger of not putting quite enough thought into the layout.

351
00:27:29,829 --> 00:27:33,190
and of missing some opportunities to make it multi-dimensional

352
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:36,712
in terms of its gameplay possibilities.

353
00:27:36,712 --> 00:27:40,635
You also run the risk of not thinking about whether what you laid out as a

354
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:45,377
blank wall will become filled with attractive detail and look climbable,

355
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:47,118
misleading or confusing the player.

356
00:27:47,118 --> 00:27:50,880
And unfortunately this is a pretty serious problem in Uncharted 2,

357
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,383
especially in detail-rich areas like the one you see here.

358
00:27:56,417 --> 00:28:00,299
So in the future, we're going to try and find a better balance

359
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:04,121
as regards these aspects of our layout process.

360
00:28:04,121 --> 00:28:08,543
And we're going to try and have more of a layout focus

361
00:28:08,543 --> 00:28:10,404
on realistic architecture earlier

362
00:28:10,404 --> 00:28:11,625
and how its details will affect the player's experience.

363
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:15,287
In full production, our project runs

364
00:28:15,287 --> 00:28:18,168
much like a conventionally scheduled game development

365
00:28:18,168 --> 00:28:19,269
project.

366
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:21,310
Working from the macro design, we

367
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:24,051
drew up a simple schedule for the environment art

368
00:28:24,051 --> 00:28:25,292
in a spreadsheet.

369
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:29,683
blocking out week-long chunks of time for our environment art groups.

370
00:28:29,683 --> 00:28:34,905
We were able to do this with confidence because the macro design had given us just enough

371
00:28:34,905 --> 00:28:40,128
detail to see where our effort should be distributed, and we knew that since the creation of the

372
00:28:40,128 --> 00:28:44,730
environments was the most time-consuming thing that we had on our plates, we could use this

373
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:49,632
main schedule as a kind of backbone of schedule for everything else to hang off, and that

374
00:28:49,632 --> 00:28:53,733
we could always be sure that we were making solid progress towards our final goal.

375
00:28:56,104 --> 00:29:02,106
As the level designs firmed up, we also got busy making lists of everything that we needed for each level,

376
00:29:02,106 --> 00:29:08,027
since we wanted to make each one as functionally complete as soon as we could.

377
00:29:08,027 --> 00:29:14,829
So we listed out objects, sound effects, visual effects, and animations that we needed to tie everything together,

378
00:29:14,829 --> 00:29:19,950
and we got them into the hands of the relevant leads as early as we could.

379
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:24,091
We need an enormous volume of entities to make a game like Uncharted 2.

380
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:33,222
For example, we had 80 in-game cinematic animations, what we call IGCs, in Uncharted Drake's Fortune.

381
00:29:33,222 --> 00:29:37,104
But we had 564 IGCs for Uncharted 2.

382
00:29:37,104 --> 00:29:43,988
Now, this is a pretty amazingly large amount of work to requisition and produce on an ad-hoc basis.

383
00:29:43,988 --> 00:29:48,170
So the leads of each department had to juggle their priorities a lot,

384
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,692
and they worked very hard to get everything built in the right order.

385
00:29:52,808 --> 00:29:57,971
They had to be very patient as the designer of each level came up to them, bugging them

386
00:29:57,971 --> 00:30:01,132
over and over again for the stuff that they needed.

387
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,373
And it's really only because of our ability to work together without much friction that

388
00:30:03,373 --> 00:30:04,613
our games always come together on time.

389
00:30:04,613 --> 00:30:05,314
So now let's talk tech for a bit.

390
00:30:05,314 --> 00:30:08,395
We had created an entirely new engine from scratch in the course of developing the first

391
00:30:08,395 --> 00:30:08,755
Uncharted.

392
00:30:20,613 --> 00:30:23,755
And that really allowed us to hit the ground running when we started Uncharted 2.

393
00:30:23,755 --> 00:30:26,857
But we had a long laundry list of improvements and updates that we wanted to make.

394
00:30:26,857 --> 00:30:31,280
And by the time we finished, we'd changed so much that we dubbed the engine the Naughty Dog Engine 2.0.

395
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:36,463
As you've probably heard already, if you're interested in PS3 development, we went cell processor crazy on Uncharted 2.

396
00:30:47,628 --> 00:30:53,369
We were famous for saying that Uncharted Drake's Fortune probably only used about 30% of the

397
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:58,731
capacity of the cell processor, which is of course the powerful chip that lies at the

398
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,131
heart of the PlayStation 3's architecture.

399
00:31:00,131 --> 00:31:03,552
And so from the very beginning of the project, our programs were focused on making sure that

400
00:31:03,552 --> 00:31:05,913
we squeezed every last ounce of performance out of the cell.

401
00:31:05,913 --> 00:31:10,514
The key to doing this was deciding which jobs we wanted to farm out to the cell.

402
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:22,396
and then writing hand optimized code to do those jobs as efficiently as possible.

403
00:31:22,396 --> 00:31:27,922
And you can see just how much of what the cells' SPUs are doing

404
00:31:27,922 --> 00:31:32,407
has been diligently optimized by a cycle counting programmer

405
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:33,188
in this screenshot.

406
00:31:35,762 --> 00:31:37,622
Probably the biggest technical change from the way

407
00:31:37,622 --> 00:31:40,122
that we did things on the first Uncharted

408
00:31:40,122 --> 00:31:43,623
was that we used the cell processor as a graphics chip,

409
00:31:43,623 --> 00:31:47,244
running it in parallel with the PS3's dedicated graphics

410
00:31:47,244 --> 00:31:49,764
processor, the RSX.

411
00:31:49,764 --> 00:31:52,985
We only did vertex processing on the SPUs before Uncharted 2,

412
00:31:52,985 --> 00:31:54,005
but now we do pixel processing.

413
00:31:54,005 --> 00:31:55,485
And we get much richer graphics by doing this.

414
00:31:55,485 --> 00:31:56,785
By moving jobs to the SPUs, we were

415
00:31:56,785 --> 00:31:57,825
free to do more on the RSX.

416
00:32:04,544 --> 00:32:08,606
and you can see the graphical leap forward that we made as a result of this

417
00:32:08,606 --> 00:32:13,349
when you look at the snow and the ice shaders that we created for the ice cave

418
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:17,351
you can also see the fur shaders

419
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:19,812
uh... who also made the fur shaders possible

420
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,593
for our awesome howling wolves

421
00:32:22,593 --> 00:32:24,154
i so wish we could get this t-shirt

422
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:35,430
We used light maps for the first time to get better detail in our pre-rendered shadowing in Uncharted 2.

423
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:43,835
And to complement them, we were also able to use a lighting technique called Screen Space Ambient Occlusion, or SSAO,

424
00:32:43,835 --> 00:32:48,978
which was hugely instrumental in making our game look as solid and as grounded as it does.

425
00:32:50,292 --> 00:32:56,217
SSAO is a rendering technique for efficiently approximating the computer graphics ambient

426
00:32:56,217 --> 00:33:03,563
occlusion effect in real time and as I move through these slides hopefully you can notice

427
00:33:03,563 --> 00:33:03,803
the effect.

428
00:33:03,803 --> 00:33:10,289
Ambient occlusion is what simulates the real world effect of the darkening that you see

429
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:16,974
in nooks and crannies and in the concave space where two convex objects touch each other

430
00:33:16,974 --> 00:33:19,116
like in between your fingers right here.

431
00:33:21,507 --> 00:33:25,350
Our SSAO is completely on the cell processor's SPUs.

432
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,692
Our graphical post-processing effects were also completely on the SPUs.

433
00:33:28,692 --> 00:33:33,395
These included big improvements in the quality of our bloom effects

434
00:33:33,395 --> 00:33:39,519
and the huge leaps forward that we made with depth of field,

435
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,440
which was kind of a hack for the first Uncharted,

436
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,383
but which for Uncharted 2 was a much more physically correct solution.

437
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:50,850
which of course made the times that we used it in the service

438
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:55,174
of cinematography that much more powerful as a storytelling

439
00:33:55,174 --> 00:33:55,854
tool.

440
00:33:55,854 --> 00:33:59,498
We also implemented a filmic HDR response curve.

441
00:33:59,498 --> 00:34:02,280
And Uncharted 2 has a much wider range

442
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,703
of colors in between light and dark than its predecessor,

443
00:34:05,703 --> 00:34:09,286
making it look much more like the game was shot on film,

444
00:34:09,286 --> 00:34:12,789
again, supporting our goal of creating a cinematic reality.

445
00:34:15,365 --> 00:34:17,527
So nine months before launch, we suddenly

446
00:34:17,527 --> 00:34:21,990
realized that our frame rate was, to put it bluntly,

447
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,050
pretty crap.

448
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:26,893
So we had to mobilize to fix it.

449
00:34:26,893 --> 00:34:28,694
And right up to the end of the project,

450
00:34:28,694 --> 00:34:31,536
we had a huge focus on frame rate.

451
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,637
Both our programmers and our artists

452
00:34:33,637 --> 00:34:35,939
had to work very hard on the issue

453
00:34:35,939 --> 00:34:39,501
to make sure that we hit 30 frames a second consistently

454
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:43,084
throughout the whole game, and so banish some of the issues

455
00:34:43,084 --> 00:34:44,585
with tearing and stuttering.

456
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,892
that we'd experienced with Uncharted Drake's Fortune.

457
00:34:47,892 --> 00:34:51,675
We had to give people the analytic tools they needed

458
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:54,117
to keep the game inside framerate,

459
00:34:54,117 --> 00:34:56,399
and we had to make a memory sacrifice in order

460
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,741
to achieve the triple buffering solution that finally

461
00:34:59,741 --> 00:35:01,122
got rid of the tearing.

462
00:35:01,122 --> 00:35:05,405
Now, this is an issue that plagues many teams, I know.

463
00:35:05,405 --> 00:35:08,147
And we just wanted to stand up and say that the only way

464
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:11,289
that we were able to tackle it was to regard it

465
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:12,890
as a very serious problem.

466
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:18,874
that we simply couldn't let slide, and then educate those on the team who needed more

467
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:26,500
insight into the specialist knowledge required to fix the problem. So it was a ton of hard

468
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,221
work, but it was totally worth it.

469
00:35:27,221 --> 00:35:33,246
So speaking of hard work, and to close out this section on the technological chops of

470
00:35:33,246 --> 00:35:38,470
Uncharted 2, I wanted to quickly come back to the subject of our train level.

471
00:35:39,493 --> 00:35:43,655
Like I said, the train was one of the first levels that we started on

472
00:35:43,655 --> 00:35:48,977
and one of the last levels that got finished.

473
00:35:48,977 --> 00:35:51,198
And to be frank, it was an evil monster of a level to create.

474
00:35:51,198 --> 00:35:54,960
In our train level, there is a train of 50 separate train cars

475
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,401
that are really moving along through our streaming environments

476
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:00,242
at a pretty good lick.

477
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:05,149
uh... you could see all fifty cars at pretty much anytime during the level

478
00:36:05,149 --> 00:36:09,270
uh... and when we first started building the level when you looked at the first

479
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,611
car from the last car

480
00:36:10,611 --> 00:36:16,173
the little lamp hanging on the front of the first car was still swinging

481
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:20,855
we had developed but we haven't really used uh... a level of detail system for

482
00:36:20,855 --> 00:36:21,895
the first uncharted

483
00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:26,097
uh... but the train certainly made us put it into action in double quick time

484
00:36:26,097 --> 00:36:27,077
as i'm sure you can imagine

485
00:36:29,376 --> 00:36:33,978
Now we had as a design goal that the train should only progress in the world

486
00:36:33,978 --> 00:36:36,119
if you were progressing along it.

487
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:41,242
And in order to make this happen we had to do a lot of weird stuff.

488
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:44,304
Sometimes teleporting the train into new positions

489
00:36:44,304 --> 00:36:47,145
depending on what you did and where you died.

490
00:36:47,145 --> 00:36:51,027
And this along with just the general craziness of the whole idea of doing a

491
00:36:51,027 --> 00:36:53,248
train for real like this

492
00:36:53,248 --> 00:36:55,189
led to a lot of bugs as you can imagine.

493
00:36:55,189 --> 00:36:57,590
Particularly with the enemy's navigational systems.

494
00:36:58,244 --> 00:37:04,448
they would get really confused every time the train teleported for instance

495
00:37:04,448 --> 00:37:07,770
uh... also for a long time when you shot the enemies and they dropped their

496
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:08,151
weapons

497
00:37:08,151 --> 00:37:12,834
the weapon would zoom back off down the track where you come from

498
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:15,596
as it shifted into the coordinate system of the world

499
00:37:15,596 --> 00:37:17,437
even better than that grenades

500
00:37:17,437 --> 00:37:20,439
would fly back in your face and blow you up after you'd thrown them

501
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:26,094
To cap things off, at one point we realized that the player's gun aiming

502
00:37:26,094 --> 00:37:27,216
raycasts

503
00:37:27,216 --> 00:37:31,280
were aiming at where the enemies had been a frame ago.

504
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,983
Now this hadn't made much difference in most of the levels,

505
00:37:34,983 --> 00:37:39,508
but in the train level the enemy was back down the track two meters

506
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:43,192
a frame ago, and so your aiming was suddenly two meters off.

507
00:37:43,192 --> 00:37:45,194
So that was just another bug that we had to fix.

508
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:53,896
And all of this goes to show why, even though the train level was a real headache for everyone involved,

509
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:57,757
it was a very positive thing to have such an extreme test case around,

510
00:37:57,757 --> 00:38:01,758
because it helped tighten up our game right across the board,

511
00:38:01,758 --> 00:38:04,198
and it made every system much more robust.

512
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:06,119
We could say to each other,

513
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,140
well, if it works in train, it must work everywhere.

514
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,020
In other words, not only have we made our game run at 30 frames a second,

515
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,381
we'd also made it run at 60 miles an hour.

516
00:38:18,876 --> 00:38:22,818
Thanks for the laugh, that got groaned at when I rehearsed it.

517
00:38:22,818 --> 00:38:27,800
So it would have been a real disaster if we hadn't started work on the train

518
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,060
level right at the beginning of the project.

519
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,462
But it now represents a real technological marvel for us

520
00:38:33,462 --> 00:38:38,184
where good game design and an amazing feat of engineering come together to

521
00:38:38,184 --> 00:38:40,585
create something that we hope is truly memorable.

522
00:38:43,492 --> 00:38:47,374
Now, as I said, we decided fairly early on in the development of Uncharted 2

523
00:38:47,374 --> 00:38:49,715
that we wanted it to have a multiplayer component.

524
00:38:49,715 --> 00:38:53,636
And we were happy, looking back, that we'd made the right decisions at the right times

525
00:38:53,636 --> 00:38:55,277
in order to make this happen.

526
00:38:55,277 --> 00:38:57,558
You can see one of our multiplayer arenas right here.

527
00:38:58,555 --> 00:39:02,418
In fact, we'd had such a good experience making the multiplayer part of Uncharted 2

528
00:39:02,418 --> 00:39:07,460
that we think that we would now not want to make a game that didn't have some kind of multiplayer

529
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:13,544
or at least networked capability, since it's such a good way for us to connect with our community of players

530
00:39:13,544 --> 00:39:16,866
and because it affords so many interesting game design opportunities.

531
00:39:18,758 --> 00:39:23,179
In order to create our multiplayer game, all we did was simply take Nathan Drake's moveset

532
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:28,321
from the single player game and implemented it in a competitive multiplayer environment.

533
00:39:28,321 --> 00:39:32,882
And we were delighted, by the way, that it immediately felt right.

534
00:39:32,882 --> 00:39:37,443
We devised a whole bunch of different game types, building outwards from pretty simple

535
00:39:37,443 --> 00:39:42,325
team deathmatches to intensely collaborative match types like Plunder, which is our take

536
00:39:42,325 --> 00:39:46,566
on Capture the Flag, where you have to get a big gold head back to a treasure chest in

537
00:39:46,566 --> 00:39:47,026
your base.

538
00:39:48,529 --> 00:39:55,795
One of our studio's co-presidents, Christoph Bollestra, wrote all of our networking code in-house from the ground up.

539
00:39:55,795 --> 00:39:59,718
He gave us a very solid base to build our multiplayer game on,

540
00:39:59,718 --> 00:40:05,803
and he was able to support us throughout the whole of development, even though he had a lot of other responsibilities.

541
00:40:07,752 --> 00:40:13,135
Rather than going with a dedicated server service, we chose to use the Amazon Elastic

542
00:40:13,135 --> 00:40:19,177
Compute Cloud, otherwise known as EC2, for things like our statistics and the machinima

543
00:40:19,177 --> 00:40:22,819
cinema files that players are able to upload to the network.

544
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:26,661
Amazon's EC2 service is very scalable.

545
00:40:27,097 --> 00:40:31,602
Basically, you only pay for as much bandwidth as you use.

546
00:40:31,602 --> 00:40:38,530
And by choosing to use it, we have saved ourselves what will probably add up to a large fraction

547
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:42,975
of a million dollars across the lifetime of our multiplayer game.

548
00:40:42,975 --> 00:40:44,417
So that's something to think about.

549
00:40:46,722 --> 00:40:52,745
We'd hired a dedicated multiplayer designer in August of 2008, which meant that we had

550
00:40:52,745 --> 00:40:58,308
someone acting as a full-time champion of the multiplayer experience for the most important

551
00:40:58,308 --> 00:41:04,091
phase of its development. As soon as we were able, we started having daily half-hour playtests

552
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:09,694
of multiplayer right after lunch, with the whole company invited to take part, and the

553
00:41:09,694 --> 00:41:11,815
short, often very heated, discussions.

554
00:41:12,155 --> 00:41:16,624
that would take place after each playtest were really vitally important for helping

555
00:41:16,624 --> 00:41:21,454
us to refine our multiplayer gameplay and for troubleshooting the problems that we encountered.

556
00:41:23,609 --> 00:41:28,871
About halfway through full production, we decided that it would be great to have some cooperative missions.

557
00:41:28,871 --> 00:41:33,734
And we put another designer that we had just hired in charge of them.

558
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:41,958
As you'll know if you've played them, they're like little alternate reality missions set in levels that we excerpted from the single-player game,

559
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:48,521
with new scenarios for the uncharted characters to have little short mini-adventures in.

560
00:41:48,521 --> 00:41:52,363
They're a ton of fun and we think our players love them.

561
00:41:53,457 --> 00:41:58,320
But looking back, deciding to try and create co-op missions so late in the day

562
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:03,803
might have been the point where we began to overextend ourselves.

563
00:42:03,803 --> 00:42:07,505
But our multiplayer guys became such a great team

564
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:11,907
and they really rocked the huge responsibility that multiplayer implied.

565
00:42:14,204 --> 00:42:19,609
When we announced our multiplayer game at a special press event in early 2009,

566
00:42:19,609 --> 00:42:23,372
some internet posting fans of Uncharted Drake's Fortune

567
00:42:23,372 --> 00:42:27,335
were concerned that the single-player game of Uncharted 2 was going to suffer

568
00:42:27,335 --> 00:42:31,398
as a result of the attention that we would have to give our multiplayer game.

569
00:42:31,398 --> 00:42:36,562
Well, even though we did have to do a lot of hard work to realize all of our ambitions,

570
00:42:36,562 --> 00:42:41,246
it turned out that the multiplayer actually helped the single-player game.

571
00:42:41,246 --> 00:42:43,848
You see, we had to tighten up the player mechanics.

572
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,769
and make them a lot snappier once we got them into a multiplayer context.

573
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:54,351
And that actually fed back into the single player game and gave it a much better, tighter

574
00:42:54,351 --> 00:42:54,471
feel.

575
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:57,752
These are the kinds of synergies that we love to find when we're building a game, and we're

576
00:42:57,752 --> 00:42:58,893
always on the lookout for them.

577
00:42:58,893 --> 00:43:01,093
So that was a terrific one to discover.

578
00:43:01,093 --> 00:43:04,414
During the development of Uncharted 2, we took our first steps into what was for us

579
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:19,439
We took our first steps into the brave new world of outsourced art assets.

580
00:43:19,439 --> 00:43:25,381
We worked with Expec in Taiwan and Lady Luck in the Philippines, and both studios did a

581
00:43:25,381 --> 00:43:26,561
really amazing job.

582
00:43:26,561 --> 00:43:30,203
For our part, we made sure that we gave our partners everything they needed to succeed,

583
00:43:30,203 --> 00:43:34,324
and we almost went as far as training them to make art that we could use.

584
00:43:34,324 --> 00:43:37,025
We would provide a package of reference materials.

585
00:43:43,517 --> 00:43:47,600
that included specifications and quite detailed construction

586
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,201
instructions, screenshots of the locations

587
00:43:50,201 --> 00:43:53,884
where the assets would be used to show their context,

588
00:43:53,884 --> 00:43:58,046
and prototype geometry to define precisely the volumes

589
00:43:58,046 --> 00:44:01,008
that the assets should occupy.

590
00:44:01,008 --> 00:44:03,510
We ended up outsourcing all sorts of work

591
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:06,071
from environments and cut scene stages

592
00:44:06,071 --> 00:44:10,414
to characters and accessories, along with monotonous work

593
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:12,195
like UVing and LODing.

594
00:44:12,754 --> 00:44:19,319
And it's really thanks to our outsourcing teams that our game is as full of eye candy as it is.

595
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:26,664
Outsourcing in this way didn't seem to have any uncomfortable or negative effects on our company culture either.

596
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,427
We were simply very happy to have the additional help.

597
00:44:30,427 --> 00:44:40,415
And it meant that we could scale up and down where necessary without having to strain our internal infrastructure through costly expansion or the horrible discomfort of layoffs.

598
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:43,871
It also meant that our level artists

599
00:44:43,871 --> 00:44:45,152
were able to spend more time focused

600
00:44:45,152 --> 00:44:47,272
on maintaining their levels and iterating on level design

601
00:44:47,272 --> 00:44:49,233
with our game designers, while someone else sweated

602
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:50,293
at least some of the details.

603
00:44:50,293 --> 00:44:52,273
So about two months out from E3 last year,

604
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:53,393
we started to organize what we were

605
00:44:53,393 --> 00:44:54,074
going to show at the event.

606
00:44:54,074 --> 00:44:54,634
We had two big deliverables.

607
00:45:05,596 --> 00:45:09,019
a playable demo of a section of the game in our fictional Nepalese city,

608
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:13,462
and a movie-style trailer that would show a lot of different parts of the game.

609
00:45:13,462 --> 00:45:17,786
However, while we'd started work on everything that we wanted to show,

610
00:45:17,786 --> 00:45:22,190
a lot of the assets and gameplay were going to need a great deal of polish

611
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:27,314
if they were going to be as impressive to E3 attendees as we wanted them to be.

612
00:45:27,314 --> 00:45:30,617
And we often do this with our projects at Naughty Dog.

613
00:45:31,345 --> 00:45:34,506
using a deadline to do with showing our game in public

614
00:45:34,506 --> 00:45:35,787
to drive production

615
00:45:35,787 --> 00:45:39,929
and the raw terror that it inspires

616
00:45:39,929 --> 00:45:43,110
certainly helps us to buckle down to some serious polish

617
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:47,893
in the end our E3 demo went very well creating the right impression at the

618
00:45:47,893 --> 00:45:49,993
Sony press event where

619
00:45:49,993 --> 00:45:53,915
our other co-president Evan gave it an amazingly sure-footed live drive

620
00:45:53,915 --> 00:45:57,877
and we were also very pleased with the way that the trailer turned out

621
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:03,734
But the next time you watch our E3 trailer, I want you to bear in mind that the things that you see in there

622
00:46:03,734 --> 00:46:08,457
were almost the only things in the game that were finished to that level of polish.

623
00:46:08,457 --> 00:46:13,801
And if the camera had turned just a meter to the left or the right, you'd be

624
00:46:13,801 --> 00:46:15,762
seeing behind the scenes and not in a very good way.

625
00:46:15,762 --> 00:46:23,187
So making the demo and the trailer was extremely useful, because it told us exactly how much work we were going to have to do

626
00:46:23,187 --> 00:46:26,470
to bring things up to a level of polish that we were happy with.

627
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:31,093
And we found out that that was a lot of work.

628
00:46:31,093 --> 00:46:34,976
Indeed, it was roundabout this time, in the spring of 2009,

629
00:46:34,976 --> 00:46:41,862
that we realized just how much game we had bitten off,

630
00:46:41,862 --> 00:46:46,706
and that we were going to have to either chew extra hard,

631
00:46:46,706 --> 00:46:47,607
or make some cuts, or choke.

632
00:46:47,607 --> 00:46:51,550
Between competitive multiplayer, our co-op modes,

633
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,992
and our sizable single-player game,

634
00:46:53,992 --> 00:46:56,754
we've been really ambitious, probably over-ambitious.

635
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,733
In particular, even though we tried to plan ahead for them,

636
00:47:01,733 --> 00:47:04,815
the set pieces in the single-player game

637
00:47:04,815 --> 00:47:07,618
had taken much longer to create and polish

638
00:47:07,618 --> 00:47:08,759
than we'd anticipated.

639
00:47:08,759 --> 00:47:12,002
And putting them together was immensely difficult,

640
00:47:12,002 --> 00:47:14,704
far worse than some of us had experienced

641
00:47:14,704 --> 00:47:16,886
even in our most brutal crunches.

642
00:47:16,886 --> 00:47:19,128
Can you hear that throbbing?

643
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:22,350
It's kind of matching the dramatic tone of this moment.

644
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:33,574
We know that a lot of developers who enjoyed Uncharted 2 are probably going to be aiming high now in terms of their own set pieces.

645
00:47:33,574 --> 00:47:40,858
And so another important takeaway from this post-mortem is a warning about just how long it takes to get that stuff right.

646
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:51,263
Even though we'd planned ahead, the set pieces took much, much longer than we'd expected, and they contributed significantly to the crunch that we experienced at the end of the project.

647
00:47:53,195 --> 00:47:59,641
So as Alpha got closer, we set about seeing where we could make some cuts and reduce the scope of the game.

648
00:47:59,641 --> 00:48:07,308
And we managed to make layout reductions to several levels early enough that we hadn't invested that many art resources in the affected areas.

649
00:48:07,308 --> 00:48:16,977
We'd also lived with the prototype block mesh versions of the levels and their gameplay for long enough that we could see fairly clearly what we should keep and what should be cut.

650
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:25,040
However, we didn't cut to the point where we were going to be able to coast to the finish line.

651
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:31,485
And life throughout 2009 was tough for pretty much everyone at Naughty Dog.

652
00:48:31,485 --> 00:48:34,987
We have never had mandated crunch at Naughty Dog,

653
00:48:34,987 --> 00:48:39,971
but we have hired people with personality types that make them hardworking,

654
00:48:39,971 --> 00:48:43,373
willing to accept responsibility, and perfectionist.

655
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:50,257
and that led to many months of long hours, late nights, and truncated or skipped weekends

656
00:48:50,257 --> 00:48:56,921
of downtime. The E3 demo marked the beginning of long hours for almost everyone at the company,

657
00:48:56,921 --> 00:49:01,903
although many people had been working extra hard for much longer than that, and that led

658
00:49:01,903 --> 00:49:07,426
to a summer of stresses on people's family lives and personal health, and of course the

659
00:49:07,426 --> 00:49:10,668
problem of the reduced productivity of tired people.

660
00:49:12,859 --> 00:49:15,261
So fortunately no one got into as bad a state as this guy.

661
00:49:15,261 --> 00:49:22,225
And while we don't think we'll ever be a studio that works nine to five year round,

662
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:27,088
we do take the threat that Crunch presents to the integrity of the studio

663
00:49:27,088 --> 00:49:30,750
and the well-being of the naughty dogs very seriously.

664
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:36,673
We're continuing to discuss ways that we can avoid ever having to repeat the experience of Uncharted 2

665
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:38,915
in terms of the toll that the projects Crunch took.

666
00:49:40,328 --> 00:49:44,131
We know that we have to become more disciplined about setting and hitting internal deadlines,

667
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:46,172
as well as external ones, to get more traction on our projects earlier.

668
00:49:46,172 --> 00:49:50,896
And we're going to try other approaches, like putting mandatory limits on the amount of time that people can spend at the office.

669
00:49:50,896 --> 00:49:55,118
So changing track a bit, in the course of Uncharted 2, we did more playtesting than we'd ever done before,

670
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:56,659
running 15 playtests over the last 10 months of the project.

671
00:50:09,478 --> 00:50:14,479
compared to only seven over the whole three years of the development of Uncharted Drake's

672
00:50:14,479 --> 00:50:20,720
Fortune. Now these were formal playtests with groups of ten players selected from the general

673
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:27,522
public who would play the game, or as much game as we had, right through. We do this

674
00:50:27,522 --> 00:50:32,423
in addition to all of the informal playtesting that we do every day on each other.

675
00:50:32,423 --> 00:50:37,904
Playtesting and metric data analysis have always been very important tools for us.

676
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:40,705
But they were particularly important for Uncharted 2

677
00:50:40,705 --> 00:50:44,909
because several complex sequences of gameplay only

678
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:47,170
came together very late in the project.

679
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:50,593
And in order to make sure that we weren't introducing any

680
00:50:50,593 --> 00:50:53,535
difficulty spikes, we had to scramble to add additional

681
00:50:53,535 --> 00:50:55,016
sanity check playtests right up to just days

682
00:50:55,016 --> 00:50:55,416
before Gold Master.

683
00:50:55,416 --> 00:50:57,638
Doing the playtests in-house was the only way that running

684
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:58,939
so many tests was possible.

685
00:51:06,889 --> 00:51:10,091
especially when a lot of them took place at short notice.

686
00:51:10,091 --> 00:51:12,172
And it also had the enormous benefit

687
00:51:12,172 --> 00:51:15,394
of allowing all of our designers and QA leads

688
00:51:15,394 --> 00:51:18,577
to regularly see their levels in action

689
00:51:18,577 --> 00:51:20,298
with brand new players.

690
00:51:20,298 --> 00:51:25,281
As our playtesters played, we uploaded metric data

691
00:51:25,281 --> 00:51:28,844
about their actions to a database over the network.

692
00:51:28,844 --> 00:51:30,705
Things like how long it took them

693
00:51:30,705 --> 00:51:32,966
to complete each part of the game,

694
00:51:32,966 --> 00:51:35,788
or how frequently they died between continue points.

695
00:51:37,218 --> 00:51:44,905
When we put that data into a spreadsheet and looked at the maximum, minimum, and median values for each point of data,

696
00:51:44,905 --> 00:51:49,910
and then color-coded cells that had values above certain targets,

697
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:54,474
parts of the game that were potentially problematic immediately jumped out at us.

698
00:51:54,474 --> 00:52:02,121
And we could then start looking at the gameplay videos that we had recorded during the playtest sessions to investigate each potential problem.

699
00:52:03,452 --> 00:52:10,735
Notice that one poor player had to play our train yard fight 27 times before they finally

700
00:52:10,735 --> 00:52:11,135
beat it.

701
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,877
That was horrifying when we saw it.

702
00:52:13,877 --> 00:52:17,078
Luckily we were able to spot that one and fix it.

703
00:52:17,078 --> 00:52:21,601
So it took a lot of energy and commitment to properly carry through with diligently

704
00:52:21,601 --> 00:52:24,122
play testing every last thing we built.

705
00:52:24,122 --> 00:52:27,223
But it was definitely worth it in terms of the quality of the game that we shipped.

706
00:52:29,456 --> 00:52:33,697
As we approached our alpha deadline, we organized a series of rolling deadlines, locking down

707
00:52:33,697 --> 00:52:37,998
the levels in small groups over the course of the four weeks leading up to each of our

708
00:52:37,998 --> 00:52:43,740
alpha, beta and gold master dates, rather than having the whole game come due on the

709
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,080
same day.

710
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:49,001
With a game as large as the one that we were making, it made good sense to do this in order

711
00:52:49,001 --> 00:52:53,502
to have fewer moving parts as we got close to the end of the project.

712
00:52:54,549 --> 00:52:59,853
We'd always planned to have long alpha and beta periods of six weeks each.

713
00:52:59,853 --> 00:53:03,956
We simply needed that much polish and bug fixing time for the size of the game

714
00:53:03,956 --> 00:53:08,539
that we'd made, and we're firm believers that allocating sufficient polish time

715
00:53:08,539 --> 00:53:11,041
can make or break a game's quality.

716
00:53:11,041 --> 00:53:18,507
However, having said that, we didn't have any time for any kind of post-production,

717
00:53:18,507 --> 00:53:23,130
and that was one last small disaster that we just had to suck up and deal with.

718
00:53:24,108 --> 00:53:28,810
Our particle artists and lighting artists and sound designers had to scramble for every

719
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:33,371
second of polish time that they could grab, since the rest of the team, designers and

720
00:53:33,371 --> 00:53:38,593
artists in particular, were making changes and bug fixes that affected their work right

721
00:53:38,593 --> 00:53:39,414
up until the end.

722
00:53:39,414 --> 00:53:46,677
In the future, we're determined to build proper post-production time into our schedules, so

723
00:53:46,677 --> 00:53:52,599
that our games can have the level of aesthetic polish that our audience increasingly expects.

724
00:53:55,727 --> 00:54:01,812
So we hit gold master on August 20th and after that there was just the usual work to do.

725
00:54:01,812 --> 00:54:06,636
Copy editing the strategy guide and starting to look towards the press and promotion work

726
00:54:06,636 --> 00:54:10,899
for the release of the game. We were extremely happy with the way that the game had come

727
00:54:10,899 --> 00:54:15,964
together and we thought that we probably had a hit on our hands. Now all that we could

728
00:54:15,964 --> 00:54:21,248
do was wait and see how critics and the public would receive the game.

729
00:54:25,313 --> 00:54:31,099
Happily, it seems that everyone agreed with us, that Uncharted 2 Among Thieves is the

730
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:37,185
best game that we've ever made. We're delighted to have been awarded quite staggering 33 Game

731
00:54:37,185 --> 00:54:43,251
of the Year awards. So I quickly wanted to thank and congratulate everyone at Naughty

732
00:54:43,251 --> 00:54:48,876
Dog and at Sony and all of our partners beyond the studio who have helped our game become

733
00:54:48,876 --> 00:54:49,517
such a big hit.

734
00:54:52,674 --> 00:54:57,000
So at some point during the development of Uncharted 2 Among Thieves,

735
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,445
we started calling it Uncharted 2 Among Friends.

736
00:55:01,445 --> 00:55:05,590
Just for a laugh really, and to keep ourselves g'd up in the middle of all of

737
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:07,452
this hard work that we were doing.

738
00:55:07,452 --> 00:55:11,658
But it also meant something deeper, at least it did to me anyway.

739
00:55:12,766 --> 00:55:18,089
I haven't really had time today to detail all of the unusual things that we do when

740
00:55:18,089 --> 00:55:24,353
we're developing a game at Naughty Dog. If you're interested to hear more about our unusual

741
00:55:24,353 --> 00:55:29,737
methods, please check out a talk that I gave just last month at the Dice conference. You

742
00:55:29,737 --> 00:55:31,518
can find a video of it by googling Naughty Dog Dice G4.

743
00:55:31,518 --> 00:55:33,619
In short, we work in a very fast, loose, seat-of-the-pants way.

744
00:55:40,961 --> 00:55:47,046
that puts an emphasis on our team members taking responsibility for the production and

745
00:55:47,046 --> 00:55:52,711
organization of their own work and for the design of the game.

746
00:55:52,711 --> 00:55:58,076
We encourage our team to stay constructively critical and honest with each other at all

747
00:55:58,076 --> 00:56:04,281
times and to always keep an open mind about our design and production process to make

748
00:56:04,281 --> 00:56:08,145
sure that we're working in the best ways that we can possibly work.

749
00:56:09,412 --> 00:56:12,674
We always take the time to listen to each other respectfully

750
00:56:12,674 --> 00:56:15,236
and we never make things personal.

751
00:56:15,236 --> 00:56:19,318
We always have to remember that we're all in it working together

752
00:56:19,318 --> 00:56:21,840
towards the greatness of the game.

753
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:27,663
And working in a way that builds strong collaborative relationships between our

754
00:56:27,663 --> 00:56:28,363
team members

755
00:56:28,363 --> 00:56:31,946
is the only way that we can make a game like Uncharted 2.

756
00:56:31,946 --> 00:56:35,708
And there is nothing as satisfying, of course.

757
00:56:36,132 --> 00:56:43,135
as the feeling that you're working at your optimal capacity among peers who respect and

758
00:56:43,135 --> 00:56:50,278
trust you. One last tiny bit of advice. If you're working on a story game, make sure

759
00:56:50,278 --> 00:57:01,423
that your game is about something, apart from just murking on dudes. Human experience is

760
00:57:01,423 --> 00:57:05,745
incredibly varied and complex, and when we discuss it in our games, we're not talking

761
00:57:05,997 --> 00:57:12,620
with subtlety and nuance, people invest their most personal values, their fears and their

762
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:18,162
hopes into the experience, and it becomes not only more entertaining, but also more

763
00:57:18,162 --> 00:57:19,703
culturally valuable.

764
00:57:19,703 --> 00:57:24,425
So I'm afraid that I don't have time to take questions on stage, but if you wait for me

765
00:57:24,425 --> 00:57:29,687
just outside the room here, I'll be happy to try and answer any questions you might

766
00:57:29,687 --> 00:57:29,947
have.

767
00:57:30,961 --> 00:57:33,603
Don't forget to go and hear the other Naughty Dog's talk.

768
00:57:33,603 --> 00:57:36,364
You can see a massive list of their talks right here.

769
00:57:36,364 --> 00:57:41,628
In addition to Neil and Bruce's talk tomorrow, Naughty Dog creative director Amy Hennig and

770
00:57:41,628 --> 00:57:46,490
Cinematics Animation Lead Josh Scher will be talking about the process of capturing

771
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:48,251
the performance of our amazing actors.

772
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:52,914
and of animating our characters in just half an hour, right now.

773
00:57:52,914 --> 00:57:56,256
3pm, room 303. It's going to be a must-see session

774
00:57:56,256 --> 00:57:59,838
