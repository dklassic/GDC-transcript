1
00:00:03,784 --> 00:00:05,846
Hi, oops, wow, okay.

2
00:00:06,546 --> 00:00:07,046
Hello everybody.

3
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:11,249
Clements, so I'm gonna be talking about

4
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:13,110
how we rewarded exploration in

5
00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:15,672
Deus Ex Mankind Divided Praxedat.

6
00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:17,413
Actually, I noticed yesterday that it wasn't

7
00:00:18,854 --> 00:00:20,816
written in the program, that it was about Prague,

8
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:23,798
so it is about Prague, I'm gonna talk only about Prague.

9
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,519
I've been working on it for four and a half years

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,682
at Eidos, so yes, I will try to make it less than an hour.

11
00:00:32,763 --> 00:00:33,884
So, let's get started.

12
00:00:33,904 --> 00:00:36,424
I'm gonna talk about me very briefly

13
00:00:36,484 --> 00:00:38,385
because I would rather talk about the actual game.

14
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:40,165
I used to be a game journalist

15
00:00:40,245 --> 00:00:43,886
for various French magazines for about seven years.

16
00:00:44,846 --> 00:00:48,267
Then I became a QA tester for a number of games,

17
00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:50,528
including Rayman, Heavy Rain, and Remember Me.

18
00:00:50,628 --> 00:00:54,709
Oops, Remember Me, being made by a company

19
00:00:54,769 --> 00:00:55,909
named Dontnod Entertainment.

20
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:57,790
You might know them for Life is Strange as well.

21
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:04,322
And in the actual Deus Ex project, I've been working first.

22
00:01:05,604 --> 00:01:06,185
You seeing anything?

23
00:01:06,285 --> 00:01:06,746
Okay, cool.

24
00:01:07,427 --> 00:01:08,509
I've been working on this map,

25
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:10,151
which is also located in Prague.

26
00:01:10,372 --> 00:01:11,413
It's Palisade Bank.

27
00:01:12,755 --> 00:01:14,956
I've been a part of the side mission team for about a year.

28
00:01:16,237 --> 00:01:18,478
And while I was doing all these things,

29
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:22,620
I was also trying to nail how our exploration

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,822
could reward players, what the navigation would be,

31
00:01:25,862 --> 00:01:28,243
the challenges that you would encounter in Prague.

32
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:31,305
So yeah, lots of things in four and a half years.

33
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:33,646
But today I will mostly talk about exploration,

34
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:36,728
how we designed it, and first,

35
00:01:37,328 --> 00:01:39,909
how we design meaningful exploration content.

36
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:40,410
I'm gonna talk.

37
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:47,113
About exploration setups, that's the cute name we gave these things and

38
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:54,696
this is what you encounter in the city hub as you play you can see the setups that tell you stories that challenge you and

39
00:01:55,217 --> 00:02:02,940
to me I define them as slices of life designed to tie narrative exploration navigation and challenge together and

40
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,221
It's we are sorry I have a delay

41
00:02:07,102 --> 00:02:08,983
So expression setups, sorry about this

42
00:02:10,114 --> 00:02:12,096
So why do we need these exploration setups?

43
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:13,057
Why did we make them?

44
00:02:13,297 --> 00:02:14,958
It was our own task.

45
00:02:14,978 --> 00:02:16,420
We didn't have an exploration team.

46
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,323
It just started with me and my colleague

47
00:02:19,383 --> 00:02:20,344
who is a senior designer.

48
00:02:20,564 --> 00:02:21,805
His name is Jeff.

49
00:02:22,106 --> 00:02:24,188
There were two of us for the better part

50
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,309
of two years on Prague.

51
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,851
So we were trying to nail what we were gonna do

52
00:02:27,952 --> 00:02:32,836
and we decided to make this meaty part of Prague.

53
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,238
So obviously we need to keep the player interested and busy in Prague.

54
00:02:36,258 --> 00:02:38,679
I don't know if you've played it, but you come back here a lot.

55
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,499
During missions, you come back here three times.

56
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,960
It's not an open-world city hub.

57
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,340
It's, as the name says, a hub.

58
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,181
So it's not that big, but it's quite dense.

59
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:53,202
And we need to get people interested with challenges and loot

60
00:02:53,282 --> 00:02:54,623
and nice little storytelling.

61
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:59,364
And we also need to flesh out our universe.

62
00:02:59,984 --> 00:03:02,285
If you don't know what a Deus Ex game is about,

63
00:03:02,365 --> 00:03:02,665
it's a...

64
00:03:04,077 --> 00:03:05,497
It's a game about transhumanism.

65
00:03:05,857 --> 00:03:06,998
It's set in the near future.

66
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:09,779
It's a game where lots of people wear prosthetics

67
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,939
and it's talking about lots of modern day issues

68
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,481
like prosthetics, actually.

69
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:17,141
Maybe you've heard of the science advances

70
00:03:17,161 --> 00:03:18,722
that we're living right now.

71
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:23,304
So an interesting deep lore and as a level designer,

72
00:03:23,344 --> 00:03:25,864
I found it very interesting to flesh this universe out

73
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:28,065
in exploration throughout the game

74
00:03:28,145 --> 00:03:29,766
and throughout Prague, mostly.

75
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:36,640
So, with that said, the main story does that.

76
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:38,622
I guess you're gonna tell me that it's the job

77
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:40,764
of the main story to tell us more about our universe

78
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,586
and I would say yes, that's true.

79
00:03:42,966 --> 00:03:45,028
The main story is the core that makes us understand

80
00:03:45,388 --> 00:03:46,930
the state of the world, what it's about.

81
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:52,515
And the big topics, the segregation, as you may know, our game is not a happy one.

82
00:03:53,756 --> 00:04:00,062
There's lots of people who are sad. They live in ghettos. They are taken away from their home.

83
00:04:00,682 --> 00:04:02,064
Augmented people, the ones who...

84
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:06,407
A quick recap, if you haven't played Human Revolution,

85
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:08,008
the previous game, at the end of the game,

86
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:09,990
millions of augmented people go crazy

87
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,972
and start beating everybody else to a pulp.

88
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:18,176
So they became, you know, kind of outcast

89
00:04:18,816 --> 00:04:19,597
and people hate them.

90
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:22,239
And yes, the main story again,

91
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:25,261
it's depicting huge stakes.

92
00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:27,783
They have multifaceted characters, conspiracies.

93
00:04:28,443 --> 00:04:29,464
Puppage comes back.

94
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:31,412
It's always there.

95
00:04:32,413 --> 00:04:35,514
And same missions are another big part

96
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:37,935
of what makes Prague interesting in the game in general.

97
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:40,856
They take the player deeper into that universe, that world.

98
00:04:42,076 --> 00:04:43,937
And yes, I've been part of the team,

99
00:04:43,957 --> 00:04:45,918
so I'm not objective, but.

100
00:04:46,878 --> 00:04:48,479
They offer truly unique experiences,

101
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:50,419
both narratively and gameplay,

102
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:51,940
because among other things,

103
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,101
they offer complex, scalable conversations,

104
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:56,702
lots of trust and consequences.

105
00:04:57,662 --> 00:04:58,423
It's very scalable.

106
00:04:58,463 --> 00:04:59,803
You can play a side mission 10 times

107
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,264
and have 10 different results.

108
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:03,145
And they offer exotism,

109
00:05:04,265 --> 00:05:06,026
like with these bald-bearded guys

110
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,707
takes control of your augmentation.

111
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:09,968
It's something the main path cannot always do.

112
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,639
And going back to the topic and why I'm saying all this,

113
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:18,700
the third layer of content, we defined it

114
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,921
that there would be exploration setups

115
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:22,501
and they complement existing content.

116
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:23,861
They're meant to be discrete.

117
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:26,502
They're meant to breathe life into the city and its people

118
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,403
in too many tiny details.

119
00:05:28,423 --> 00:05:31,023
So they're not meant to be in a competition

120
00:05:31,043 --> 00:05:32,744
with NFMS, they're just meant to complement

121
00:05:33,064 --> 00:05:34,864
and tell us about the world.

122
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,365
Let the player connect the pieces via environment,

123
00:05:37,385 --> 00:05:39,565
storytelling, little bits of stories.

124
00:05:41,392 --> 00:05:44,813
And hopefully they also meant to make the world fun to navigate around.

125
00:05:45,853 --> 00:05:51,375
So all this to say that we have three levels of complexity and three levels to tell story

126
00:05:51,395 --> 00:05:57,856
and I will speak about the latest one, the smaller one, but hopefully not less interesting.

127
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:06,219
So that's a video, if it plays, of what an actual expression setup is.

128
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,459
And there is no sound.

129
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:09,060
So I will...

130
00:06:10,572 --> 00:06:17,355
speak over it. So it's a pretty small one. It's something that they used to do a lot

131
00:06:17,395 --> 00:06:23,197
in human revolution in Detroit and Hengsha. This is what you encounter most of the time

132
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:28,980
when you explore a little setup that tells you a contained story, some narrative, a little

133
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:35,083
loot. That was pretty much it. It was very interesting. But for Mankind Divided, me and

134
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,024
Jeff, we wanted to expand this

135
00:06:38,885 --> 00:06:40,827
this concept and make it richer.

136
00:06:40,907 --> 00:06:44,951
And we did it with two things, connectivity and density.

137
00:06:45,632 --> 00:06:47,033
And I will explain connectivity later.

138
00:06:47,093 --> 00:06:50,537
Basically we wanted to connect exploration setups together,

139
00:06:50,597 --> 00:06:52,198
locations together, NPCs together,

140
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,422
so you would hopefully make a connection between locations.

141
00:06:56,523 --> 00:07:02,768
But first, the nice part about Prague is that, as I said, it's not an open world.

142
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:03,969
It's a hub.

143
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:05,170
And it's very dense.

144
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,494
And that's a nice moment to bring up a quote by someone you might know.

145
00:07:10,734 --> 00:07:11,695
Warren Spector said that.

146
00:07:12,816 --> 00:07:16,399
And I didn't know about this quote before two weeks ago.

147
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,040
But I added it anyway.

148
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,943
And that's exactly what we try to do with Prague CDUB.

149
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,424
We try to make it as dense as possible.

150
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:24,065
So there is.

151
00:07:25,972 --> 00:07:27,634
no wasted space anywhere.

152
00:07:27,955 --> 00:07:30,057
Everything that we put in Prague has a meaning.

153
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,440
It's supposed to complement the world,

154
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,043
make it richer, make it better,

155
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:37,946
and make the experience of the player really cool

156
00:07:38,467 --> 00:07:40,569
for those who are interested in this kind of thing.

157
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,145
So the image shows an example of,

158
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:46,187
it's pretty early work, it was four years ago.

159
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:49,893
We tried to place our exploration locations around the city.

160
00:07:50,413 --> 00:07:51,455
So as you can see, it's pretty dense

161
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:54,039
and it's maybe four times denser now.

162
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:56,262
Just gives you a little idea of how we worked

163
00:07:57,463 --> 00:07:58,925
at placing our content.

164
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:03,152
And we did it with very few modules at first.

165
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:05,755
As I said, we were four, a team of four,

166
00:08:06,356 --> 00:08:07,318
for two years in Prague.

167
00:08:07,338 --> 00:08:08,940
We were two designers, two artists,

168
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,605
and I was a junior, so I was trying to do things.

169
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,650
And we did it with these modules we were trying to nail.

170
00:08:17,887 --> 00:08:19,908
what could exploration look like?

171
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:22,230
Where would we put our content?

172
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,510
So we had modules.

173
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:25,972
We defined that shops, apartments, and storages

174
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:29,614
would be our main ways to convey exploration setups.

175
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:31,975
And we would place them around the city.

176
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:35,457
We would think that maybe the player's gonna go this way

177
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:36,618
because they have to go to a mission,

178
00:08:36,638 --> 00:08:37,818
they have to do a side mission.

179
00:08:37,838 --> 00:08:40,020
So we would place these little bricks everywhere

180
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,480
and we would make challenges around them

181
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,281
based on augmentation and player skills.

182
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:47,990
and navigation and that's how we started doing it.

183
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:51,597
Pretty rough, but it helped us define

184
00:08:51,617 --> 00:08:52,419
what exploration would be.

185
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:56,831
And as I said, connectivity, in addition to density.

186
00:08:58,132 --> 00:09:00,494
We thought that we would connect location

187
00:09:00,614 --> 00:09:02,276
by using proxying, using environment,

188
00:09:02,996 --> 00:09:06,079
meaning that if two locations look the same,

189
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,721
maybe they share a connection.

190
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,684
And that's something, I know it's ugly,

191
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,465
but it's actually something that we had in the game

192
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:14,766
four years ago, or something.

193
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:19,709
And I would put, I had this idea of a setup

194
00:09:20,009 --> 00:09:23,030
of an alcoholic woman who you could visit her apartment

195
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,871
and then you could visit also a liquor store

196
00:09:24,891 --> 00:09:25,932
that we set up in Prague.

197
00:09:27,172 --> 00:09:29,653
And I just scaled up a huge bottle of wine

198
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:31,674
and I put it in her apartment and in the store

199
00:09:31,774 --> 00:09:35,796
and we just would test this setup to see if it worked.

200
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:39,397
And that's the idea, like maybe there is a link

201
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,578
because the prop scene looks the same.

202
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:43,799
But this is not something that we use 100%

203
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:45,040
because you don't want.

204
00:09:46,342 --> 00:09:49,643
You don't want to rely on only props in an environment

205
00:09:49,663 --> 00:09:53,065
because places that look the same are often boring

206
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:53,985
and you don't want boring.

207
00:09:54,946 --> 00:09:58,227
So we tried to find various ways to diversify

208
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:00,948
the look of our setup and show connections in a subtle way,

209
00:10:00,988 --> 00:10:03,129
whether it's narrative or visual.

210
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,551
And that's the very same setup four years later

211
00:10:08,652 --> 00:10:11,253
of this alcoholic woman.

212
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,250
whose apartment is pretty hard to reach,

213
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,312
so that's another part of what we did with Exploration.

214
00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:21,155
We tried to vary the challenges as with the Deus Ex game.

215
00:10:21,876 --> 00:10:23,397
You need to have a lot,

216
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:25,378
you need to support every player style.

217
00:10:26,619 --> 00:10:28,901
So Exploration is always meant to challenge you.

218
00:10:29,181 --> 00:10:30,322
There's nothing that is given.

219
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:32,204
And so in his apartment,

220
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:35,426
yes, you still have lots of liquor bottle.

221
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:41,922
And you can stumble on some emails and I'm spoiling,

222
00:10:41,962 --> 00:10:44,147
but this email is from the liquor store,

223
00:10:44,287 --> 00:10:45,350
which is called Hemingway's.

224
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,331
And maybe if you walk around the city street

225
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:52,612
and you stumble upon maybe this store,

226
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:54,533
which is gonna appear very soon,

227
00:10:55,513 --> 00:10:57,474
yes, that's how you make the connection.

228
00:10:57,514 --> 00:10:59,134
Maybe if you paid attention to the emails,

229
00:10:59,174 --> 00:11:01,875
you notice that maybe these are linked.

230
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:04,336
And the stories themselves of this alcoholic

231
00:11:04,376 --> 00:11:06,697
and the store owner, they're not linked in the proper sense.

232
00:11:07,577 --> 00:11:09,058
You discover a whole new setup in there

233
00:11:09,238 --> 00:11:12,319
and you can loot the whole store if you want.

234
00:11:14,146 --> 00:11:15,868
and drink lots of liquor.

235
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:20,774
But yes, that's the way we try to connect things

236
00:11:20,834 --> 00:11:23,877
in a subtle way that the careful explorer will notice.

237
00:11:24,298 --> 00:11:24,658
Hopefully.

238
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:27,101
So from this, from what I just showed you,

239
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:27,802
we extracted.

240
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:30,589
Key principles for exploration setups,

241
00:11:31,249 --> 00:11:33,531
they are supposed to offer a challenge,

242
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:36,674
like we saw, you need to work to get there.

243
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:38,296
We're not limited by main story

244
00:11:38,356 --> 00:11:40,157
and critical path constraints.

245
00:11:40,277 --> 00:11:45,482
We don't have to give the player easy access to our things,

246
00:11:46,102 --> 00:11:47,844
which is the actual cool part.

247
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:49,859
And they have to grant rewards,

248
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,201
and rewards can take many forms,

249
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:52,902
and I will talk about that later.

250
00:11:52,922 --> 00:11:56,946
And we create subtle links between locations,

251
00:11:58,327 --> 00:12:00,169
and they're meant to tell compelling stories

252
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:01,350
about the world, as I say,

253
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:05,754
make the universe look deeper and better.

254
00:12:06,635 --> 00:12:08,437
And there's another concept about expression setups

255
00:12:08,497 --> 00:12:12,041
that I had bits of struggle explaining it

256
00:12:12,142 --> 00:12:15,145
when we were designing it before to my hierarchy

257
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:16,527
that there's no sense of progression.

258
00:12:17,227 --> 00:12:19,170
They're not missions, they're not locators that you follow.

259
00:12:20,194 --> 00:12:25,717
We were very insistent on it because usually people want to have a, they want progression,

260
00:12:25,737 --> 00:12:29,859
they want you to go from point A to point B and it was suggested at several point during

261
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,300
the development that these apply to.

262
00:12:33,301 --> 00:12:38,844
The idea came that we should have locators and the sense that in order to see an expression

263
00:12:38,864 --> 00:12:41,805
set up you had to go through a first part and then a second part.

264
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:43,926
And we didn't want that at all.

265
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:45,987
So there is no sense of progression.

266
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:48,548
You can explore connected location

267
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:51,049
in whatever order you want,

268
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:52,150
and you're always gonna get something

269
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,070
whether you make a connection or not.

270
00:12:56,731 --> 00:12:58,172
And quickly, what are the rewards?

271
00:12:59,232 --> 00:13:02,534
Obviously, I'm gonna talk about it a lot during this talk.

272
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:04,915
They can be functional, loot, lots of loot.

273
00:13:06,255 --> 00:13:06,876
Things to pick up.

274
00:13:07,156 --> 00:13:09,277
Narrative is its own reward.

275
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:10,577
I'm gonna talk about narrative quite a lot.

276
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:14,648
but not too much, and navigation.

277
00:13:15,148 --> 00:13:18,769
So I'll also talk in another part of the talk

278
00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:22,931
how exploration helps making missions better

279
00:13:23,491 --> 00:13:24,132
with navigation.

280
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:28,934
But there is no sense of progression, as I just said,

281
00:13:28,994 --> 00:13:31,315
but we still have types of exploration setups,

282
00:13:31,355 --> 00:13:31,815
and it's only.

283
00:13:33,016 --> 00:13:35,357
for tracking purposes, because some setups,

284
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,657
as I said, it wasn't a team,

285
00:13:36,697 --> 00:13:40,159
it wasn't, we weren't an official exploration team,

286
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:42,399
so every request that I had for these,

287
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,360
they were level design requests,

288
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,421
they were not tied to any budget,

289
00:13:46,461 --> 00:13:50,462
so I had to be careful how I was measuring my setups.

290
00:13:50,522 --> 00:13:54,664
So we created 24 of them, the ones I documented,

291
00:13:54,704 --> 00:13:57,085
there's many more that I just did.

292
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:02,006
And 20 of them are stand-alone.

293
00:14:02,066 --> 00:14:03,547
They're the very first one I showed you.

294
00:14:03,587 --> 00:14:04,428
They're very simple.

295
00:14:04,448 --> 00:14:05,629
They only have one location.

296
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,651
They're just contained.

297
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:10,313
70%, so the majority are the medium one.

298
00:14:10,353 --> 00:14:12,734
They connect at least two locations together.

299
00:14:12,754 --> 00:14:14,616
The one we just saw with the alcoholic lady.

300
00:14:15,997 --> 00:14:17,238
And 10% are large one.

301
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,260
And large one are interesting,

302
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,442
and I'll show a video of that right now.

303
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:26,225
And I'll explain why they're kind of tricky to do.

304
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:30,326
So we don't have sound so I'm gonna explain it.

305
00:14:30,727 --> 00:14:33,008
You enter this apartment and there's people talking

306
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:37,371
about who's inside and people talking in our game,

307
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:39,593
it's very expensive so for an exploration setup

308
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,454
to have people actually talking, it's pretty cool.

309
00:14:42,655 --> 00:14:43,655
It gets us excited.

310
00:14:44,475 --> 00:14:47,276
And you can see these pictures of an unknown location

311
00:14:47,896 --> 00:14:49,936
that you will visit later, so it's supposed to intrigue you.

312
00:14:51,177 --> 00:14:53,037
And then stay in your memory.

313
00:14:54,277 --> 00:14:57,358
And in these emails, you find out that this guy,

314
00:14:57,398 --> 00:15:00,539
this painter guy, who has picture of, again,

315
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:04,220
his ex-wife is escaping from somewhere,

316
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,180
you don't really know, and that's the paint store.

317
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,201
Again, we still link location via PropSync.

318
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,772
You discovered another piece of this story.

319
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,636
And it also extends to Golem City.

320
00:15:15,676 --> 00:15:17,137
This is a map that is outside of Pride.

321
00:15:17,277 --> 00:15:19,520
It's a critical path map that you have to go to.

322
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:23,725
And you pick up another part of this story right here.

323
00:15:25,026 --> 00:15:26,428
So maybe you make the connection

324
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:27,649
because the name is similar.

325
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,229
And if you do, it's good.

326
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,612
And then last part of the game,

327
00:15:33,712 --> 00:15:35,074
if you remember the first location,

328
00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:37,958
there were photos of this very place, the theater,

329
00:15:38,058 --> 00:15:40,522
which only opens later in the game.

330
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:43,686
And you can basically find the same pictures

331
00:15:43,907 --> 00:15:45,268
that you found in the first location.

332
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,833
But you can also, as I said, no sense of progression,

333
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:50,795
so you can just visit any location

334
00:15:50,895 --> 00:15:53,157
and make the link yourself, or don't make the link

335
00:15:53,177 --> 00:15:54,479
and just take the loot and the codes.

336
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,661
And that's fine by us.

337
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:57,903
You can do whatever you want.

338
00:15:57,943 --> 00:16:01,226
But the thing that was hard with this particular setup.

339
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:05,482
was that with anything that is big and spread out

340
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:06,682
between various locations,

341
00:16:07,143 --> 00:16:09,203
especially out of a natural map,

342
00:16:09,243 --> 00:16:10,684
this one connects out of Prague,

343
00:16:11,424 --> 00:16:13,585
it makes comprehension very difficult

344
00:16:13,645 --> 00:16:16,026
and memory work very difficult as well.

345
00:16:17,347 --> 00:16:19,767
And that's a lesson for the future, actually.

346
00:16:19,847 --> 00:16:21,788
I had to find a sweet spot between invisibility,

347
00:16:21,908 --> 00:16:23,809
something you will never notice, you will never connect,

348
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:27,130
and overexposition, something kind of vulgar

349
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,211
that takes you by the hand.

350
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:30,632
or the impact suffers.

351
00:16:31,512 --> 00:16:33,033
And for this particular setup, I think,

352
00:16:34,133 --> 00:16:36,854
the rewards were not very balanced.

353
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:39,075
I was too involved in this story.

354
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:39,795
I liked it very much.

355
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:41,836
So every time you would stumble upon a piece of the story,

356
00:16:41,896 --> 00:16:44,297
like in Golem City, you would just have an email

357
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:46,278
and nothing else, and that was pretty cheap of me.

358
00:16:47,318 --> 00:16:50,600
So in the future, I had to try to vary what I give you.

359
00:16:52,388 --> 00:16:56,230
And another interesting example of big setups

360
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,071
and how we try to entice exploration in Prague.

361
00:17:01,152 --> 00:17:02,893
This is your headquarters.

362
00:17:03,693 --> 00:17:04,134
Please play.

363
00:17:06,114 --> 00:17:07,775
Hmm, that's a video.

364
00:17:09,035 --> 00:17:12,137
Okay, that's your headquarters, this is where the hero,

365
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,058
Adam Jensen, works.

366
00:17:14,238 --> 00:17:17,080
And this is a place that is interesting for two reasons.

367
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,801
First, we take something from you in this area,

368
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:21,662
we remove your ability to shoot people

369
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:24,164
because we don't want you to shoot your boss

370
00:17:24,424 --> 00:17:26,305
or your psychiatrist, which is a shame,

371
00:17:26,365 --> 00:17:27,346
but it's still like that.

372
00:17:27,366 --> 00:17:29,987
So we thought it was a good way to actually...

373
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:33,539
balance it, the fact that we take something from you,

374
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:35,639
we would give you a lot of content

375
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,180
in terms of narrative and exploration.

376
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,300
And everybody isn't someone

377
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,520
who is gonna explore on their own.

378
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:43,001
So for people who, they're kind of new to the game,

379
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:45,042
they don't really know what the city has to offer,

380
00:17:45,062 --> 00:17:47,522
we thought it was a good idea to place

381
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:51,423
lots of little connections to the city hub,

382
00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:53,303
like what you just saw, I picked up a code

383
00:17:53,884 --> 00:17:56,144
that was talking about a case from one of my colleague

384
00:17:56,384 --> 00:17:59,805
about a storage locker he wanted to investigate,

385
00:17:59,965 --> 00:18:01,025
this very storage locker.

386
00:18:02,026 --> 00:18:05,488
And maybe it's gonna entice players to explore Prague more

387
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:07,910
because you have to come back to this area.

388
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:10,833
It's critical to come back to the task force a lot.

389
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:15,036
And to us it was a good way to entice exploration in Prague.

390
00:18:15,256 --> 00:18:16,617
And maybe, as I just did,

391
00:18:16,657 --> 00:18:18,739
I messed up my colleague's investigation.

392
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,881
So, too bad for him.

393
00:18:23,047 --> 00:18:25,908
Another interesting thing, and it's again,

394
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:27,610
it's a lot of narrative.

395
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,651
Deus Ex is a very narrative-driven game.

396
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:33,113
And as level designers, it was our job

397
00:18:33,173 --> 00:18:37,416
to expand the universe and make interesting stories

398
00:18:37,436 --> 00:18:38,556
in our map.

399
00:18:39,337 --> 00:18:41,478
And the main thing that we wanted to depict was

400
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:45,141
Now that society has fallen in our game,

401
00:18:46,102 --> 00:18:48,905
with, as I said, segregation, unhappy people,

402
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:50,346
ghettos, it sucks.

403
00:18:50,886 --> 00:18:52,188
So everybody who was augmented,

404
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,689
who close to augmentation business,

405
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,552
we wanted to talk about what happened to them,

406
00:18:57,893 --> 00:18:59,154
what are their issues now,

407
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:01,456
what, you know, the artists, the augmented,

408
00:19:01,976 --> 00:19:03,958
people who were forced to get augmented for their job

409
00:19:04,258 --> 00:19:06,901
by the megacorp, how did they survive?

410
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:11,322
And we do that by, in this video you have two example

411
00:19:12,123 --> 00:19:15,283
that I think are interesting in exposing

412
00:19:15,503 --> 00:19:17,384
how the socioeconomic class was affected.

413
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:20,664
We had this woman who was a neural implant programmer

414
00:19:20,765 --> 00:19:24,685
and now she's turned into a programmer of crappy house AI.

415
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:27,026
You actually hear these house AIs

416
00:19:28,046 --> 00:19:29,466
in some location in the city hub.

417
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:32,946
And she's not happy about it and she's secretly developing,

418
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:35,830
I won't spoil you there, but she's developing some AI

419
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:40,055
that is a direct reference to other AIs

420
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:41,416
that we find in the Usex universe.

421
00:19:41,817 --> 00:19:44,240
And on the right, this ballet dancer,

422
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,202
of course she used to be very successful,

423
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:48,885
she used to have a nice place at the opera,

424
00:19:48,905 --> 00:19:51,608
and now she is just a bar owner.

425
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:56,202
with secrets because everybody has secrets in Prague.

426
00:19:57,142 --> 00:20:00,363
But to us, it was very important to talk about these people,

427
00:20:00,463 --> 00:20:01,964
the little people, the simple people,

428
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:03,705
the citizens who were impacted by

429
00:20:03,725 --> 00:20:06,145
this semi-apocalyptic event.

430
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,766
And that sums it up.

431
00:20:08,986 --> 00:20:10,567
The stories, all of the stories we create,

432
00:20:10,687 --> 00:20:12,928
they meant to fit the universe key events

433
00:20:13,868 --> 00:20:15,929
and how they impacted people's life.

434
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:18,070
So topics like the hog incident,

435
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,111
segregation, police state, and classes.

436
00:20:22,431 --> 00:20:27,054
And we need to talk about all kind of people, even the ones that we would hate in real life.

437
00:20:28,955 --> 00:20:30,997
Because it's easy to talk about people we would like.

438
00:20:31,537 --> 00:20:35,679
But we have to talk about the assholes as well.

439
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,223
So that's just some pictures that we threw around that we thought were interesting in

440
00:20:41,263 --> 00:20:42,103
fleshing out the universe.

441
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:50,809
And that's something that I was struggling with a little bit, a little at some point,

442
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:51,409
because I wanted...

443
00:20:52,898 --> 00:20:54,279
everything to be very interesting.

444
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:55,440
And as I said, I was a junior,

445
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,001
so I wanted everything to be super top

446
00:20:58,742 --> 00:21:00,483
and best stories, best characters,

447
00:21:00,523 --> 00:21:01,784
and best environment storytelling.

448
00:21:01,824 --> 00:21:02,845
And I had a discussion with

449
00:21:04,186 --> 00:21:05,967
the former lead side mission designer.

450
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:07,168
He told me once that my

451
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:13,854
stories were impacting his submissions character because they were too complex and

452
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:17,858
They were meant to be more invisible than this and it was kind of shutting casting a shadow

453
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:25,546
Over his own characters, and that was just weird and that's what we call the small what things

454
00:21:25,606 --> 00:21:28,609
I don't know if you ever heard this word is the feeling that everybody

455
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:33,265
everybody is awesome and they live next door to each other.

456
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,008
And that's something we really wanted to avoid.

457
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:41,456
And as a practical example, I had this guy,

458
00:21:42,477 --> 00:21:46,443
that I, the actual conflictual guy, this was...

459
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:50,639
I want to put all that into him, all his ideas, how to make him interesting.

460
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:57,445
So I would justify how to make his apartment interesting in an environment way.

461
00:21:57,685 --> 00:21:59,227
I wanted lots of good props for him.

462
00:21:59,287 --> 00:22:02,670
I wanted his apartment to be connected to another map.

463
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,511
I wanted it to be really huge.

464
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:07,374
And that was way too much.

465
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:13,331
And so I finally understood what the side mission lead

466
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:14,652
was trying to tell me.

467
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:19,937
And so further on, we designed these people as ordinary

468
00:22:20,077 --> 00:22:22,078
with a twist, because they need to have something

469
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:24,240
interesting, but very discreet and subtle.

470
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:27,703
And yes, that's about finding the right balance

471
00:22:27,743 --> 00:22:30,506
between the dark secrets and the ordinary routine

472
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:31,586
of a relatable person.

473
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:35,617
keeping them human, it's not about making the story

474
00:22:35,857 --> 00:22:37,879
absolute crap and uninteresting,

475
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,281
but you have to give little interesting brain crumbs

476
00:22:40,341 --> 00:22:41,702
and let the player do the rest.

477
00:22:43,183 --> 00:22:44,945
And final lesson about this,

478
00:22:45,425 --> 00:22:48,368
I used to get very panicky when I saw empty space,

479
00:22:49,008 --> 00:22:51,991
because again, we were alone for a long time in Prague,

480
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:53,512
and I would just start...

481
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:57,774
propsing a place, putting stuff in it,

482
00:22:57,854 --> 00:23:01,535
and if it was empty, it was making me uncomfortable,

483
00:23:01,635 --> 00:23:04,636
so I would over-complexify things that didn't need to.

484
00:23:06,336 --> 00:23:09,257
And as our narrative director said to me once,

485
00:23:09,657 --> 00:23:11,377
he came to help me at the very end of the project,

486
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:14,278
making these stories a little less convoluted.

487
00:23:15,218 --> 00:23:17,299
He used this a lot with me because,

488
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,560
yes, I wanted everybody to be awesome,

489
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,980
and that's not a good thing you want in exploration.

490
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,880
Exploration is supposed to...

491
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,863
be very, very discreet.

492
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:28,146
And the player has to make up their own stories.

493
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:33,892
And last, about narrative,

494
00:23:33,932 --> 00:23:36,835
then we'll be more talking about navigation.

495
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,551
We have several very characterized areas in Prague.

496
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:46,454
There's the red part of this image is the old district.

497
00:23:46,954 --> 00:23:49,095
It's where tourists live, middle class.

498
00:23:49,195 --> 00:23:51,376
The blue area is business area,

499
00:23:51,396 --> 00:23:54,637
so businessmen during the day and hobos during the night.

500
00:23:56,258 --> 00:23:57,839
Downtown LA was our main reference

501
00:23:58,099 --> 00:23:59,700
from what our creative director said.

502
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,261
And the yellow part is the poor district.

503
00:24:03,061 --> 00:24:07,763
Poor people, augmented people, sad people, and drug addicts.

504
00:24:09,387 --> 00:24:12,769
But that doesn't mean that you have to be absolute about it.

505
00:24:13,649 --> 00:24:16,710
We really try to explore the universe

506
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:19,932
and to find out ways to twist our stories

507
00:24:20,032 --> 00:24:21,512
and make them less absolute because

508
00:24:23,073 --> 00:24:24,594
it is not because you live in the poor district

509
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:25,334
or in the sewers.

510
00:24:25,774 --> 00:24:27,335
Well, actually the sewers is not a good example.

511
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:28,696
It's not because you live in the poor district

512
00:24:28,736 --> 00:24:30,997
that you are an augmented hobo with an addiction issue.

513
00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:33,698
Or a purist who hates all orgs

514
00:24:33,918 --> 00:24:36,039
and would report them to the police.

515
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:42,794
And an example of that is that I was reading a document one day, a creative direction document,

516
00:24:42,834 --> 00:24:48,696
and it was saying how in this particular poor district there's 70% augmented people who

517
00:24:48,736 --> 00:24:53,418
live there and 30% non-augmented people, so 100% human, we call them I guess.

518
00:24:54,713 --> 00:24:57,054
And I thought it was interesting to give a twist

519
00:24:57,194 --> 00:24:59,115
to an expression set up in the area that I created

520
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:00,876
about this group called Ad Astra,

521
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:03,056
who was actually trying to help bridge the gap

522
00:25:03,096 --> 00:25:04,837
between augmented and non-augmented.

523
00:25:04,877 --> 00:25:07,418
It was a cute little story that was pretty optimistic,

524
00:25:07,738 --> 00:25:09,699
and Deus Ex is not optimistic.

525
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,480
So I was actually trying to do something different,

526
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:19,422
and rewarding with narrative and XP point like this.

527
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:23,275
Now, I'm done with the narrative part of this talk.

528
00:25:23,415 --> 00:25:24,575
It was pretty important to talk about it,

529
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:26,617
in my opinion, to help you understand

530
00:25:26,657 --> 00:25:29,658
how we try to design our world and flesh it out.

531
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:32,099
But exploration is not just about telling stories

532
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,180
and environment storytelling.

533
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,261
It's also about rewarding every other part of the game.

534
00:25:36,922 --> 00:25:41,244
And in our case, we have to benefit using exploration

535
00:25:41,304 --> 00:25:43,125
and navigation, every aspect of the game,

536
00:25:43,645 --> 00:25:45,186
and make all type of content shine.

537
00:25:46,477 --> 00:25:48,018
from the most important, like main missions,

538
00:25:48,238 --> 00:25:49,919
and side missions, to the best kept secrets,

539
00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:52,440
things that people will usually never find.

540
00:25:54,162 --> 00:25:57,944
So, most exploration setups are standalone and original.

541
00:25:58,004 --> 00:25:59,925
Some of them feature special reward

542
00:26:01,546 --> 00:26:03,868
that provide unique advantages during mission.

543
00:26:04,128 --> 00:26:05,169
It's too bad I don't have the sound,

544
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:09,712
but you can photo that video that gives a vibrant example

545
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:12,974
of how exploration complements an existing mission.

546
00:26:15,201 --> 00:26:17,163
That's my greatest puzzle you just saw there.

547
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,106
Turn off the TV to find this story item

548
00:26:20,426 --> 00:26:22,448
that is connected to the Palisade Bank.

549
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:24,090
And if you make the connection,

550
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:25,832
you go to this area, the bank,

551
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:30,116
and you meet this guy and you can tell him this.

552
00:26:32,318 --> 00:26:36,523
Use your item to make him like you.

553
00:26:45,177 --> 00:26:49,799
he's not happy that you're an augmented guy and he was taking real pleasure in telling you to

554
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:57,321
screw yourself. But because you've explored, congratulations, you find this item and you

555
00:26:57,801 --> 00:27:03,543
bypassed, now a whole area of the bank is open to you, your client, you stole his identity,

556
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:10,785
shame on you, but it allows you to bypass something that would have been very hard

557
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:14,547
otherwise because the bank is a very difficult mission, full of people like this guy.

558
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:19,669
So that's one of the way we found to reward main missions

559
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:20,870
using exploration.

560
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,710
And it's not just about finding story item,

561
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,271
it's also a lot about pure navigation,

562
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,291
so pure level design,

563
00:27:29,112 --> 00:27:32,532
and connecting exploration, narrative,

564
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:37,013
and how it can connect via sometimes.

565
00:27:39,045 --> 00:27:42,228
alternate path like we like to use in Deus Ex.

566
00:27:42,768 --> 00:27:45,370
So this area is interesting because it's an apartment

567
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,011
of some artist, you don't know what happened there.

568
00:27:48,692 --> 00:27:49,713
There's blood, it's a mess.

569
00:27:50,493 --> 00:27:53,555
So it's a nice little story on its own and I added,

570
00:27:54,296 --> 00:27:56,937
yes, it's an errant, I know people troll about errants,

571
00:27:57,078 --> 00:28:02,001
I'm sorry, I really tried to keep them very small in print.

572
00:28:03,388 --> 00:28:07,690
And this area offers another route towards main mission,

573
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,190
which is a color shop.

574
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,511
And yes, I put a little storytelling piece in that event.

575
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:15,652
I think it's important to keep events interesting.

576
00:28:16,752 --> 00:28:19,773
And it offers you a new path.

577
00:28:19,813 --> 00:28:23,373
So it's also about connecting various areas

578
00:28:23,473 --> 00:28:25,634
using exploration setups.

579
00:28:27,214 --> 00:28:31,075
And as you may know, when you design a platforming element

580
00:28:31,175 --> 00:28:34,556
for a first person game like ours, it's very weird.

581
00:28:35,476 --> 00:28:40,338
So we try to avoid having a 300 pounds guy

582
00:28:40,438 --> 00:28:41,358
standing on flower pots.

583
00:28:42,898 --> 00:28:45,699
And we do that in different ways.

584
00:28:47,302 --> 00:28:49,223
So that's actually pure visual language,

585
00:28:49,243 --> 00:28:51,144
we need to be very careful about how we entice

586
00:28:51,264 --> 00:28:54,506
our expression routes, how we make people want to

587
00:28:54,646 --> 00:28:56,727
explore something and how not to deceive them.

588
00:28:57,768 --> 00:28:59,029
So we need to have clear, enticing,

589
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:00,450
integrated navigation platform,

590
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,931
that's a lot harder to do than it looks.

591
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:05,413
And identifiable navigation threads

592
00:29:05,473 --> 00:29:07,214
from all levels of navigation.

593
00:29:07,294 --> 00:29:08,435
These are just quick example,

594
00:29:08,475 --> 00:29:09,956
I could talk about navigation for hours,

595
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,236
but I don't have time right now.

596
00:29:12,137 --> 00:29:13,458
We have to be able, basically the rule,

597
00:29:13,498 --> 00:29:15,439
where we have to be able to identify a route.

598
00:29:16,793 --> 00:29:19,374
for an exploration setup from anywhere from the ground,

599
00:29:19,414 --> 00:29:22,195
we would see all of these platforms connecting together

600
00:29:22,235 --> 00:29:24,256
and we would know that something is accessible

601
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:25,417
because in a Deus Ex game,

602
00:29:26,537 --> 00:29:29,878
you never want to lead the player somewhere they cannot go

603
00:29:29,918 --> 00:29:31,919
because we let the player explore everything.

604
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,260
We want the player to be able to access everything

605
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,161
that he sees.

606
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:36,761
That's the Deus Ex experience.

607
00:29:37,582 --> 00:29:39,743
So we need to remove the navigation clutter

608
00:29:40,243 --> 00:29:42,204
because they betrayed the player's expectation.

609
00:29:42,244 --> 00:29:44,265
That's called affordance, actually.

610
00:29:45,806 --> 00:29:48,787
And it's something that we were very careful about.

611
00:29:48,807 --> 00:29:52,369
If it meant deleting balconies that led to fake windows,

612
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:53,849
we would do it a lot.

613
00:29:53,949 --> 00:29:57,311
I think I deleted 100 balconies without the artist knowing.

614
00:29:58,611 --> 00:29:59,171
But it's a good thing.

615
00:30:02,032 --> 00:30:02,313
Do it.

616
00:30:04,573 --> 00:30:06,654
And another thing about navigation is that sometimes

617
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:11,476
it was, we were reaching a point where we didn't really

618
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:12,597
know how to make it better.

619
00:30:12,617 --> 00:30:13,837
It was too clunky.

620
00:30:15,436 --> 00:30:19,441
At many places it was too weird, you would grab a ledge and you would fall to your death

621
00:30:19,481 --> 00:30:20,803
and it wasn't that funny.

622
00:30:20,843 --> 00:30:26,631
So we used this, the curfew, is, actually it was really a nightmare when it happened

623
00:30:26,651 --> 00:30:28,273
because Prague was never designed.

624
00:30:28,533 --> 00:30:30,196
This is something that happened very late in development.

625
00:30:30,236 --> 00:30:30,636
We had to...

626
00:30:31,477 --> 00:30:34,298
make the city an actual mission,

627
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,739
because there would be cops everywhere.

628
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,700
You walked when you come back from a certain mission.

629
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:41,121
You cannot navigate the streets however you want,

630
00:30:41,642 --> 00:30:44,203
because people shoot you, police shoot you on site.

631
00:30:45,003 --> 00:30:47,244
And that wasn't something we planned.

632
00:30:47,644 --> 00:30:49,965
We always planned to be able to create chaos in Prague

633
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:52,126
and let you deal with it.

634
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:57,268
But we never planned to have a whole map

635
00:30:57,308 --> 00:30:59,969
that would support stealth and combat inside of Prague.

636
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:04,911
In the end we ended up using it to make everything else better

637
00:31:04,971 --> 00:31:07,691
because navigation had to be really tight for this part of the game.

638
00:31:07,711 --> 00:31:09,452
It had to be possible to escape the cops.

639
00:31:10,632 --> 00:31:13,473
And with this example, it's an area that sucked.

640
00:31:14,713 --> 00:31:16,633
Before we had this constraint.

641
00:31:17,413 --> 00:31:22,695
It was very hard to navigate and because we really worked hard to make...

642
00:31:24,128 --> 00:31:26,589
this possible for the player because we had to,

643
00:31:27,509 --> 00:31:29,170
well it's still pretty hard, this section,

644
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,550
but we had to make it possible.

645
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,451
And it involves tweaking navigation a lot,

646
00:31:34,771 --> 00:31:36,751
so it would be able to do these kind of things.

647
00:31:39,072 --> 00:31:42,473
And bypass cops, or just kill them.

648
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:46,173
And sometimes we would use,

649
00:31:47,054 --> 00:31:48,514
maybe I shouldn't say that, but we cheated.

650
00:31:49,815 --> 00:31:52,259
If you have the occasion to do it without it showing,

651
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:54,563
we added collision boxes in some ledges

652
00:31:54,703 --> 00:31:56,827
so you wouldn't fall all the time

653
00:31:57,147 --> 00:31:59,131
and it wouldn't show because you don't see your feet

654
00:31:59,231 --> 00:31:59,591
and it's cool.

655
00:32:01,594 --> 00:32:02,815
But yeah, we cheated a little bit,

656
00:32:02,895 --> 00:32:04,637
but it made the experience a lot better in the end.

657
00:32:05,077 --> 00:32:07,879
And that's an example of how a really tough constraint

658
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,461
helped us make navigation better for the whole city hub

659
00:32:10,501 --> 00:32:12,723
because what we did for the curfew

660
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:16,086
impacted all of the other visits of Prague

661
00:32:16,126 --> 00:32:17,787
where you don't have to staff around police.

662
00:32:18,148 --> 00:32:19,969
And it's a good idea to think about it.

663
00:32:22,843 --> 00:32:25,904
Now, as in any Deus Ex game,

664
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:28,545
we give a lot of freedom to player again.

665
00:32:28,705 --> 00:32:31,706
We always have to offer multiple ways to enter a location.

666
00:32:32,926 --> 00:32:35,427
So our navigation always supports every pillar that we have,

667
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:37,268
so stealth, combat, exploration,

668
00:32:38,528 --> 00:32:40,249
killer profiles, every kind of play types

669
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:40,989
we have to think about.

670
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,445
And so we put a lot of efforts into avoiding magic locks.

671
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:48,728
And that's something that always annoys me in games

672
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,032
when they do this kind of thing.

673
00:32:51,713 --> 00:32:52,735
I don't like this kind of thing.

674
00:32:52,855 --> 00:32:55,339
It's putting propping in front of doors.

675
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,242
It's something that we don't.

676
00:32:58,988 --> 00:33:00,509
It's forbidden in Deus Ex to do that.

677
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:03,952
But sometimes the ID just comes in.

678
00:33:03,992 --> 00:33:05,774
This was an ID that was brought up by someone

679
00:33:05,794 --> 00:33:10,098
a long time ago to prevent an access to one of the banks,

680
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:12,741
the Palisade Bank, which is a map in Prague, again.

681
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:14,723
Prevent the access using this.

682
00:33:15,724 --> 00:33:16,144
That sucks.

683
00:33:18,187 --> 00:33:20,590
If you want to block navigation and exploration,

684
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:24,013
if you want an area to remain locked out

685
00:33:24,073 --> 00:33:26,475
for narrative reason, for critical path reasons,

686
00:33:27,195 --> 00:33:28,937
we tend to do it very clearly.

687
00:33:29,137 --> 00:33:32,620
This is a grid, so it doesn't look very...

688
00:33:33,841 --> 00:33:35,362
I mean, it's still a blockage.

689
00:33:35,822 --> 00:33:39,644
But it's OK, because this area is the Red Lake District.

690
00:33:40,465 --> 00:33:43,366
This is where people go to see naked women

691
00:33:45,387 --> 00:33:48,549
and do other things with augmented women and men.

692
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,833
And it's so enticed when you play,

693
00:33:53,253 --> 00:33:55,355
when you go to Prague and you walk around the street,

694
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:58,177
everybody explains to you that the red light district is,

695
00:33:58,878 --> 00:34:00,840
it only opens at night, so during the day,

696
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,641
don't expect to be able to go through.

697
00:34:02,681 --> 00:34:05,384
So it's so well integrated into the game

698
00:34:05,404 --> 00:34:07,786
that we know why it's closed.

699
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:10,348
And if you have to close an area,

700
00:34:11,189 --> 00:34:12,450
if navigation must be controlled,

701
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:14,392
it must be crystal clear why,

702
00:34:14,412 --> 00:34:15,793
and it's tremendously important.

703
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:21,162
for us and maybe for you at some point.

704
00:34:22,323 --> 00:34:25,486
And a good example of that, that was the same path

705
00:34:26,546 --> 00:34:29,528
that when I showed you the broomstick in front of the door,

706
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:32,611
this is what it was meant to block.

707
00:34:32,991 --> 00:34:36,654
This is the secret path to the Palisade Bank

708
00:34:36,694 --> 00:34:38,755
and again, sorry for the spoilers,

709
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:39,936
it's supposed to be a hard one.

710
00:34:41,277 --> 00:34:44,239
But this area was supposed to be blocked off.

711
00:34:46,632 --> 00:34:48,514
because someone wanted to block it off for,

712
00:34:48,534 --> 00:34:53,499
for no reason, but I had to fight quite hard

713
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,320
to not have it locked.

714
00:34:55,501 --> 00:34:59,044
And we do that because, as you can see,

715
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,427
when we reach this area, this is the,

716
00:35:01,607 --> 00:35:03,849
this is the bank's vault shaft.

717
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,431
This is where you can go anytime you want

718
00:35:06,491 --> 00:35:08,492
because you're gonna find key cards in Prague

719
00:35:08,552 --> 00:35:09,112
if you explore.

720
00:35:10,033 --> 00:35:11,173
They were very well hidden,

721
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,774
so if you found some, congratulations.

722
00:35:13,554 --> 00:35:16,156
And you can go there at all time

723
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:18,277
to loot these vaults and interesting part of it

724
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:22,299
is that this is supposed to be an exit to the bank map.

725
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:23,580
It's not supposed to be an entrance,

726
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,142
but if you really, really are a good explorer.

727
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:32,085
you can actually enter this area and it's very rewarding in its own way and it's something that

728
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:36,948
it was worth the fight because it makes the city really more interesting.

729
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,641
And side missions, quickly about them,

730
00:35:43,321 --> 00:35:46,683
they have very different constraints than the main path.

731
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:50,425
And when I came onto the team,

732
00:35:50,445 --> 00:35:52,466
I was wondering how I could help them

733
00:35:53,626 --> 00:35:56,588
benefit from what we developed in Prague.

734
00:35:57,348 --> 00:35:58,709
And the interesting thing is that side mission

735
00:35:58,749 --> 00:36:01,870
in Human Revolution, they had to put their things

736
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,572
into an existing layout, nothing was made

737
00:36:05,232 --> 00:36:07,253
specifically for the side missions in Human Revolution.

738
00:36:08,093 --> 00:36:09,054
So it was pretty hard for them.

739
00:36:09,114 --> 00:36:10,835
And from the very start of Prague,

740
00:36:11,975 --> 00:36:13,656
we, the level designers, the two of us,

741
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,216
we talked to the side mission team

742
00:36:16,197 --> 00:36:20,259
to help them integrate their missions into layouts that

743
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:21,539
would be made specifically for them.

744
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,140
And it's very important to know because when

745
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,841
they needed some location, they would come to me

746
00:36:25,861 --> 00:36:29,402
and they would tell me, can you create something so that we

747
00:36:29,442 --> 00:36:30,163
could put our things?

748
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,524
And that's how the sewers came to life.

749
00:36:32,584 --> 00:36:35,867
The sewers are great if you don't know them.

750
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:39,870
And they're meant to help the side missions thrive

751
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:41,171
by having their own layouts.

752
00:36:42,332 --> 00:36:44,994
And that's how every location that I made

753
00:36:45,034 --> 00:36:47,236
for the side missions, they take expression into account

754
00:36:47,296 --> 00:36:50,318
and it helps making them really harmonized

755
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:54,202
according to the, with regard to the rest of the game.

756
00:36:55,876 --> 00:37:01,250
And another thing with SideMission is that they have a very small team, a multidisciplinary

757
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,232
team that works very well.

758
00:37:02,252 --> 00:37:03,736
They have a writer, designers, scripters.

759
00:37:04,518 --> 00:37:05,260
But sometimes...

760
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,823
They're really wild, so they might not always respect

761
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:11,605
their sexist peers.

762
00:37:12,586 --> 00:37:14,067
For example, when I came onto the team,

763
00:37:14,087 --> 00:37:15,728
you would get ambushed in this very location.

764
00:37:16,389 --> 00:37:18,391
Some guys would just jump you, some pike your smirks,

765
00:37:19,412 --> 00:37:21,093
and they would just start a fight with you

766
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:21,954
in the middle of the street,

767
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:23,956
and that's something that might sound cool,

768
00:37:24,196 --> 00:37:25,097
but in this kind of game,

769
00:37:25,897 --> 00:37:27,599
you always have to let the player have a choice

770
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:30,842
to fight or not to fight, so I removed that.

771
00:37:32,463 --> 00:37:35,544
And the cool thing about it is that I moved this setup

772
00:37:36,344 --> 00:37:38,225
of people attacking you in your own house

773
00:37:39,165 --> 00:37:40,925
because it was already planned for exploration.

774
00:37:41,005 --> 00:37:43,246
There's a multi-pass, multi-options already.

775
00:37:43,286 --> 00:37:44,867
You can escape via the windows.

776
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:49,008
And I think that's something that is important to do

777
00:37:49,048 --> 00:37:50,108
when you have a team that is working.

778
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,360
on the side and you don't have a lot of contact with them.

779
00:37:54,621 --> 00:37:56,522
It was, in our case, it worked,

780
00:37:56,622 --> 00:37:57,922
it made the mission better,

781
00:37:57,982 --> 00:37:59,202
it made the conversation that you have

782
00:37:59,222 --> 00:38:00,243
with the key character better.

783
00:38:00,723 --> 00:38:01,843
It supported gameplay better,

784
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,284
you can stealth your way out.

785
00:38:03,544 --> 00:38:05,525
Now you can fight these guys, you can just hide.

786
00:38:06,205 --> 00:38:07,085
And it wasn't the case before,

787
00:38:07,145 --> 00:38:08,466
and it's very, very important to know

788
00:38:08,506 --> 00:38:10,166
what these guys are doing.

789
00:38:10,926 --> 00:38:12,587
Because, as I'm saying here,

790
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:15,168
when a place perfectly fits within the world's world,

791
00:38:15,228 --> 00:38:15,628
it shows.

792
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:17,208
And for side mission,

793
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:19,029
it was very important to keep an eye on it.

794
00:38:21,814 --> 00:38:24,355
And that's another thing that I tended to do a lot,

795
00:38:25,115 --> 00:38:27,195
in addition to over-complexify my stories,

796
00:38:28,316 --> 00:38:29,456
is I wanted to connect everything,

797
00:38:31,136 --> 00:38:32,457
because I wasn't always realizing

798
00:38:32,497 --> 00:38:33,977
that other people were doing cool stuff,

799
00:38:34,637 --> 00:38:36,978
because we were alone, I'm gonna repeat that a lot,

800
00:38:37,018 --> 00:38:39,639
we were not a big team, we were experimenting,

801
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:40,419
we were doing a lot of things.

802
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,680
But sometimes I just wanted to, yeah,

803
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,980
I was over-designing, and it's not sexy,

804
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:48,881
it's not sexy because the word design is in it.

805
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:51,842
And yeah, too many connection.

806
00:38:52,062 --> 00:38:53,945
I want to connect side missions to expression setups.

807
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:57,208
I wanted to connect main stories with whatever.

808
00:38:57,248 --> 00:38:58,710
I was trying to connect the world.

809
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,632
And it was just, again, small world feeling.

810
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:01,914
We want to avoid that.

811
00:39:02,054 --> 00:39:03,736
And many connection makes the world look fake

812
00:39:04,617 --> 00:39:05,338
and convenient.

813
00:39:06,919 --> 00:39:09,703
So it's resisting the urge to do that.

814
00:39:11,608 --> 00:39:13,430
And now, philosophy on not blocking stuff

815
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:17,714
is actually another thing that I had to fight about.

816
00:39:18,955 --> 00:39:20,897
We both had to fight about it, me and Jeff,

817
00:39:22,138 --> 00:39:23,339
the level designer who worked with me.

818
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:26,782
We wanted to keep exploration content there at all times.

819
00:39:26,902 --> 00:39:29,325
We didn't want to block anything from the player.

820
00:39:29,385 --> 00:39:31,347
And then some of the guys in our team,

821
00:39:31,367 --> 00:39:33,128
they wanted to make exploration.

822
00:39:34,845 --> 00:39:36,086
in steps in some way.

823
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:38,967
They wanted some contents to be locked during a visit

824
00:39:39,027 --> 00:39:40,168
and then you would come back to Prague

825
00:39:40,188 --> 00:39:41,388
and this would be magically unlocked.

826
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:44,569
And as I said, with magic locks, they suck.

827
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:49,591
So we had to fight for it because simple reasons.

828
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:52,292
In Deus Ex, you don't have skill objects like in Zelda.

829
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:54,233
Our skill objects are augmentations.

830
00:39:55,674 --> 00:39:58,014
And you can get augmentations or not.

831
00:39:58,174 --> 00:39:59,515
You can get whatever augmentations you want

832
00:39:59,535 --> 00:40:00,675
and we have no way of tracking

833
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:01,956
what you're gonna be equipped with.

834
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,601
And yeah, none of our augmentation are given through the main story.

835
00:40:07,201 --> 00:40:09,762
So we offer, Prague offers, and the whole game offers,

836
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,903
skill-based exploration and not progression-based one.

837
00:40:12,963 --> 00:40:16,624
And that's what we explain to our leads and directors

838
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,745
to not let them block accesses.

839
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:22,986
Because when you see something, when you see an apartment

840
00:40:23,406 --> 00:40:25,266
and a balcony, you have to be able to get there and...

841
00:40:26,687 --> 00:40:29,990
we took specific care into making all these little

842
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,111
augmentation challenges.

843
00:40:31,731 --> 00:40:33,273
So someone who gets augmented,

844
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:35,595
they can have a party in Prague

845
00:40:35,615 --> 00:40:37,016
and be very happy about exploration.

846
00:40:37,076 --> 00:40:38,117
And that's good for us.

847
00:40:38,157 --> 00:40:40,700
And if, the thing is, if people explore

848
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,701
the hell out of Prague and have seen people do it,

849
00:40:43,682 --> 00:40:47,303
read about people who were spending 10 hours in Prague during their first visit there and

850
00:40:47,323 --> 00:40:48,304
they were exploring everything.

851
00:40:49,384 --> 00:40:54,386
And some people were not happy about it because what if we don't have content later to offer

852
00:40:54,406 --> 00:40:54,546
them?

853
00:40:55,086 --> 00:40:56,647
And me, I was very excited about it.

854
00:40:56,707 --> 00:41:01,008
I was very excited about people finding everything during the first visit.

855
00:41:01,068 --> 00:41:05,170
It was cool, but it's a matter of respecting the game speeler.

856
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,901
But there are exceptions, of course.

857
00:41:10,461 --> 00:41:13,123
We cannot just open everything all the time.

858
00:41:14,443 --> 00:41:16,024
If a setup is tied to a mission's timeline,

859
00:41:16,044 --> 00:41:18,545
we need to lock the out-of-context content.

860
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:21,007
But if you have to lock something,

861
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:23,888
you must make sure that the explored area

862
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,649
remains interesting and useful,

863
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,130
and tease the player into coming back.

864
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,752
And that's something that is very hard to do, I think,

865
00:41:30,892 --> 00:41:33,773
is how do you convey to the player

866
00:41:33,813 --> 00:41:35,934
that if he comes back to a location later,

867
00:41:35,974 --> 00:41:36,735
it's gonna be different.

868
00:41:38,945 --> 00:41:42,188
there's no really magic things to do there,

869
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,390
but what we did with this exception, this example,

870
00:41:44,471 --> 00:41:46,332
is that at some point you're gonna reach this apartment

871
00:41:47,553 --> 00:41:49,575
and you're gonna see these pictures of you

872
00:41:50,496 --> 00:41:53,259
and Vega, which is another key character in our game.

873
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:55,401
So you see these pictures and hopefully...

874
00:41:56,342 --> 00:42:00,445
It teases you into coming back later because it's personal.

875
00:42:00,905 --> 00:42:01,546
It's a picture of you.

876
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:03,647
So it involves you directly, and I

877
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,049
think it makes it easier to convey the message that,

878
00:42:06,369 --> 00:42:09,051
if you come back, something may be different.

879
00:42:10,553 --> 00:42:13,155
And when you come back, it's actually different.

880
00:42:13,695 --> 00:42:14,656
There's a pragma.

881
00:42:14,696 --> 00:42:16,457
There's some guy apparently is talking to you.

882
00:42:18,227 --> 00:42:20,509
and you don't know who the hell it is, he is.

883
00:42:21,389 --> 00:42:23,031
And he's waiting for you in an area.

884
00:42:23,351 --> 00:42:26,614
And another thing that is interesting with that setup

885
00:42:26,674 --> 00:42:28,195
is that I couldn't have this guy being here

886
00:42:28,235 --> 00:42:30,297
before a certain critical path mission

887
00:42:30,937 --> 00:42:32,538
because it wouldn't have made sense at all.

888
00:42:32,598 --> 00:42:34,980
It's something we discussed with Mary Dermal,

889
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,722
which is our executive narrative director.

890
00:42:37,543 --> 00:42:39,704
She said that it didn't make sense to have this guy,

891
00:42:39,744 --> 00:42:42,567
this train station cop who suffers from PTSD

892
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:44,208
after the explosion that you witnessed

893
00:42:44,468 --> 00:42:45,349
at the beginning of the game.

894
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:50,151
So I do something that usually never do, I spawn him.

895
00:42:51,331 --> 00:42:53,212
After you read an email and for exploration,

896
00:42:53,252 --> 00:42:56,013
something that we never do, but in exceptional case,

897
00:42:56,393 --> 00:43:00,314
like this guy, it's essential because else,

898
00:43:01,094 --> 00:43:03,755
actually before, you would encounter this guy again

899
00:43:03,795 --> 00:43:05,536
in a bike alley and he would just jump you

900
00:43:05,636 --> 00:43:08,417
and force you to fight him and yeah,

901
00:43:08,457 --> 00:43:09,337
that couldn't stay in the game.

902
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:11,278
He had to remain consistent.

903
00:43:13,138 --> 00:43:19,226
Another thing that I just said, visiting the same place twice, most people don't do it

904
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:23,751
because it doesn't make sense. They have no way of knowing if it's going to be different.

905
00:43:25,399 --> 00:43:28,460
And in our case, in our game, if a location is going to change,

906
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,881
it should be the result of the player's action.

907
00:43:31,702 --> 00:43:32,682
Most of the time, we have...

908
00:43:33,563 --> 00:43:35,323
This is the example, I don't know if you remember,

909
00:43:35,383 --> 00:43:37,625
but the very first example I gave of an exploration setup

910
00:43:37,705 --> 00:43:40,146
is this guy, this crazy augmented dude

911
00:43:40,186 --> 00:43:42,587
who's apparently stealing things from the street

912
00:43:42,627 --> 00:43:44,168
and putting them on his little archway.

913
00:43:45,028 --> 00:43:48,350
I made three different versions of the props for this area.

914
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:52,152
visit one, visit two of Prague and visit three. It's all going to be different. It's going

915
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:58,136
to offer you some rewards, some narrative, little pocket secretaries with codes in there

916
00:43:58,156 --> 00:44:01,618
and you're going to discover what this guy is about, what he's doing. And since it's

917
00:44:01,658 --> 00:44:06,602
very easy to do, this propping, it's a very accessible area. It's worth it to do it if

918
00:44:06,642 --> 00:44:12,966
it's really cheap. Changing the environment for no reason else that I found it cool. But

919
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:15,828
it still is an exception and you should do it pretty often.

920
00:44:18,042 --> 00:44:18,863
And that's a video.

921
00:44:19,303 --> 00:44:20,985
Without the sound, it's gonna be pretty boring.

922
00:44:21,445 --> 00:44:23,787
But it's a cat lady, it's a side mission apartment.

923
00:44:24,468 --> 00:44:26,910
And it's, the thing I was saying about

924
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:29,112
if you have to lock content,

925
00:44:30,393 --> 00:44:33,316
the area must remain interesting, sorry.

926
00:44:33,476 --> 00:44:35,778
So this apartment is a side mission character.

927
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:37,860
It's not active yet, you don't have the mission yet,

928
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,143
but you can find all of these cool cat pictures

929
00:44:41,203 --> 00:44:42,304
and there's a cat shrine.

930
00:44:42,604 --> 00:44:44,746
And we made sure that it was intriguing and interesting.

931
00:44:45,367 --> 00:44:48,249
And you didn't hear it, but when you enter this apartment,

932
00:44:48,749 --> 00:44:51,391
there's a cat sound, meow, every time you enter.

933
00:44:52,032 --> 00:44:53,473
And this is my greatest accomplishment.

934
00:44:53,713 --> 00:44:55,354
Thanks for the audio guys for doing this.

935
00:44:56,715 --> 00:44:58,737
And that makes this apartment tremendously

936
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:01,499
important and interesting.

937
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,743
So, a little conclusion with a twist about design,

938
00:45:06,763 --> 00:45:08,944
because I'm not really done yet.

939
00:45:10,389 --> 00:45:13,732
Everything I just said, so I can sum it up with these phrases.

940
00:45:13,992 --> 00:45:17,156
Know what your people on your team do and how your own work can help.

941
00:45:17,817 --> 00:45:19,899
And that's my work with the Sight Mission Team

942
00:45:19,919 --> 00:45:23,443
that allowed me to really, really take that into practice.

943
00:45:25,164 --> 00:45:27,026
And play one to explore your world.

944
00:45:27,086 --> 00:45:29,109
If you need to block an area, justify the hell out of it.

945
00:45:29,649 --> 00:45:31,751
No crates before doors, please.

946
00:45:33,868 --> 00:45:35,209
unless it's the topic of your game

947
00:45:35,249 --> 00:45:37,470
and you want to explore this concept.

948
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,211
Every constraint can have benefits.

949
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,572
Think about how a constraint can enrich the experience.

950
00:45:42,592 --> 00:45:44,373
The example of the curfew, how it helped us

951
00:45:45,373 --> 00:45:48,235
make navigation better is a good example of that.

952
00:45:49,195 --> 00:45:50,736
And don't change things for the sake of it.

953
00:45:51,556 --> 00:45:52,817
If you want player to notice,

954
00:45:54,118 --> 00:45:56,139
find strong way to convey the message in.

955
00:45:58,527 --> 00:46:01,368
Yeah, that's what I did by putting the pictures of you

956
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:03,290
on the wall of this guy so you would remember that.

957
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:06,992
And LDs, we are keepers of the experience,

958
00:46:07,893 --> 00:46:09,554
but it doesn't mean you have to be rigid about it.

959
00:46:10,134 --> 00:46:14,937
Find ways, smart ways to twist the experience

960
00:46:14,997 --> 00:46:17,599
and it's something that I learned also by my contact

961
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:21,601
with the side mission team who are like wild cards

962
00:46:21,701 --> 00:46:23,162
and they do all kinds of exotic stuff

963
00:46:23,202 --> 00:46:24,023
and it's very interesting.

964
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,231
But, as I said, I'm not done yet.

965
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,534
With this part, I'm gonna talk about what I've learned

966
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:32,556
in a more personal way.

967
00:46:33,617 --> 00:46:36,038
Because as I said, this was a four and a half years project

968
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:38,400
and we were a very small team in Prague for a long time.

969
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:41,503
And there were some personal struggles

970
00:46:41,543 --> 00:46:42,404
that we've had to face.

971
00:46:42,584 --> 00:46:47,147
And me, as a junior, I was not always, you know,

972
00:46:47,628 --> 00:46:49,329
very detached from what I was doing.

973
00:46:50,913 --> 00:46:53,134
And if I'm just stepping back a little bit,

974
00:46:53,194 --> 00:46:58,096
I'm gonna explain the growing up process, I guess.

975
00:46:59,777 --> 00:47:03,439
With examples, I had exploration setups in our game

976
00:47:03,499 --> 00:47:05,900
that became main missions.

977
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:10,863
And I'm gonna explain to you why I had issues with that.

978
00:47:12,702 --> 00:47:14,864
I don't know if you played the game,

979
00:47:14,904 --> 00:47:16,925
there's two missions, one is called Alicent Complex

980
00:47:17,165 --> 00:47:19,066
and the other is called Otar Casino.

981
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,068
They're two main missions that used to be only explorations.

982
00:47:22,648 --> 00:47:24,709
So I was making them in Marlene Corner

983
00:47:24,729 --> 00:47:26,110
and I was happy doing my things.

984
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:33,537
And at some point, they became big missions and I had problems, personal problems with

985
00:47:33,577 --> 00:47:33,637
it.

986
00:47:33,657 --> 00:47:37,922
I was afraid that because it was going to be part of the main story, it was going to

987
00:47:38,343 --> 00:47:42,188
be streamlined and less interesting in terms of design, that all of the cool stuff, the

988
00:47:42,228 --> 00:47:45,111
hidden stuff that I would put in there would disappear.

989
00:47:46,562 --> 00:47:48,644
And that was just because I was actually giving

990
00:47:48,724 --> 00:47:51,625
too much attention to the 1% of hardcore explorers,

991
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,707
and I wasn't seeing the big picture enough.

992
00:47:54,907 --> 00:47:57,289
And that's why I took things so personally as well.

993
00:47:57,589 --> 00:47:59,710
So if I have this example of the casino,

994
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:01,091
it was a simple exploration setups.

995
00:48:01,872 --> 00:48:05,654
It looks ugly, but I had the help of an artist.

996
00:48:05,714 --> 00:48:07,295
We were doing it kind of under the radar,

997
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,496
and it was a lot better looking than this.

998
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:11,497
We did it in secrecy.

999
00:48:12,878 --> 00:48:13,959
I gave it to the side mission team

1000
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:14,959
because they needed a location.

1001
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:17,206
to put one of the setups in.

1002
00:48:17,647 --> 00:48:19,549
And someday our gameplay director, Patrick,

1003
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,752
he just stumbled upon it somehow

1004
00:48:22,812 --> 00:48:25,775
while exploring the many ways of the sewers.

1005
00:48:26,896 --> 00:48:30,840
He decided to make it a main mission area.

1006
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,343
So now you have this debate with this mafia guy.

1007
00:48:34,504 --> 00:48:36,286
And it's a really cool location.

1008
00:48:36,306 --> 00:48:39,069
But to me, it was a lose or lose situation.

1009
00:48:40,948 --> 00:48:46,432
I would have trouble getting out of my comfort zone, actually.

1010
00:48:46,512 --> 00:48:49,554
I was afraid it was going to suck, that a lot of people were going to work on it and

1011
00:48:49,574 --> 00:48:53,716
were taking basically the map from me and I was angry about it.

1012
00:48:54,817 --> 00:48:59,139
And I wasn't talking to anybody, so I had to get out of my seat.

1013
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:06,084
and had to actually grab the people who were working on this area after it became a main story mission.

1014
00:49:06,104 --> 00:49:12,849
There were like 10 people now working on it and before that it was just me as a single nerd working on it.

1015
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:17,233
And yes, I had to fight to keep the interesting content in it.

1016
00:49:17,273 --> 00:49:21,536
It's not because it became part of the main mission that it's not interesting anymore.

1017
00:49:21,616 --> 00:49:26,420
And another example of it that was pretty close to me is this guy, Joseph.

1018
00:49:28,204 --> 00:49:34,188
He had this very nice apartment with lots of candles and an obvious reference to Hyperion for those who know it.

1019
00:49:35,629 --> 00:49:37,770
And it was a really nice apartment and one day...

1020
00:49:39,864 --> 00:49:45,586
A map named Allison Complex came to life and my setup and this map had the same topic.

1021
00:49:45,706 --> 00:49:52,088
It was about people trying to reach the machine god and trying to connect to some mechanical

1022
00:49:52,128 --> 00:49:52,468
deity.

1023
00:49:53,008 --> 00:49:56,610
So I was thinking what is going to happen to my guy?

1024
00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:03,952
And at this point I was actually afraid again because we were very isolated for a long time

1025
00:50:05,212 --> 00:50:05,672
in our team.

1026
00:50:07,073 --> 00:50:10,877
I was kind of afraid to again lose some cool exploration things.

1027
00:50:11,998 --> 00:50:16,663
But again I had to think how to make this setup part of the main story

1028
00:50:17,163 --> 00:50:19,205
without ruining all of its intentions.

1029
00:50:19,706 --> 00:50:21,428
And actually I was kind of forced,

1030
00:50:21,448 --> 00:50:23,229
because I was afraid to talk to...

1031
00:50:24,885 --> 00:50:28,968
I was free to talk to our executive narrative director, Mary, she's very nice, but I was

1032
00:50:29,009 --> 00:50:33,112
kind of impressed by her, so I wasn't, you know, I was shy.

1033
00:50:33,673 --> 00:50:38,117
And one of my colleagues forced me to go talk to her and explain to her what my intentions

1034
00:50:38,157 --> 00:50:39,438
were with this setup.

1035
00:50:39,478 --> 00:50:45,023
So I set up a meeting and I was surprised that she was so open.

1036
00:50:46,204 --> 00:50:48,165
to, you know, I wasn't expecting it.

1037
00:50:49,266 --> 00:50:50,866
And what I've learned is that people usually

1038
00:50:51,027 --> 00:50:52,567
strive for good compromise and new option,

1039
00:50:52,627 --> 00:50:54,849
but three years ago I did not necessarily know that.

1040
00:50:56,609 --> 00:50:59,211
And now Joseph is happy again, he's still dead.

1041
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:02,252
But he has a nice little custom animation pose

1042
00:51:02,272 --> 00:51:05,194
that I could never have gotten if I was,

1043
00:51:05,914 --> 00:51:07,695
if I remained alone with my little setup.

1044
00:51:07,895 --> 00:51:08,836
Like, again, a nerd.

1045
00:51:09,256 --> 00:51:10,817
And this is what his setup looks like now,

1046
00:51:10,897 --> 00:51:14,278
and the cool thing about it is that by actually moving my,

1047
00:51:15,932 --> 00:51:20,154
But to talk to the people who are responsible

1048
00:51:20,194 --> 00:51:22,035
for the experience, to Marie, to Jeff,

1049
00:51:22,095 --> 00:51:25,276
to our creative director, it actually made

1050
00:51:25,296 --> 00:51:26,237
the whole experience better.

1051
00:51:26,337 --> 00:51:28,958
Now this location has a lot more content

1052
00:51:29,138 --> 00:51:32,780
now that it was in the radar of our direction.

1053
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,741
It got lots of resources put into it.

1054
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:38,383
We have custom drawings, we have even conversation,

1055
00:51:38,743 --> 00:51:42,845
the absolute most expensive ingredient

1056
00:51:42,865 --> 00:51:43,705
that we have in Deus Ex.

1057
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:48,074
And it's still cool, it's still a subtle little environment

1058
00:51:48,094 --> 00:51:51,237
setup that you can stumble into, it's very interesting.

1059
00:51:51,257 --> 00:51:55,942
Yeah, this guy is, he looks weird, but he's, yeah.

1060
00:51:56,042 --> 00:51:57,864
That's an additional conversation that is linking

1061
00:51:57,904 --> 00:52:00,166
this setup to the Allison complex mission,

1062
00:52:00,186 --> 00:52:02,028
so the two of them, they work separately,

1063
00:52:02,189 --> 00:52:03,470
and they can work together as well.

1064
00:52:05,953 --> 00:52:06,433
And that's...

1065
00:52:08,172 --> 00:52:08,913
the lesson from it.

1066
00:52:09,053 --> 00:52:10,495
So from two optional setups,

1067
00:52:11,276 --> 00:52:12,877
done in secrecy with no money,

1068
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:14,979
we got two polished critical missions

1069
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,121
supporting all of our pillars,

1070
00:52:17,142 --> 00:52:18,783
and some cool exploration areas

1071
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,926
with their own storytelling reward in secret.

1072
00:52:23,588 --> 00:52:24,590
And what I've learned from this is

1073
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:25,851
that optional content is great,

1074
00:52:26,371 --> 00:52:27,272
but it doesn't have to die

1075
00:52:27,332 --> 00:52:28,714
if it becomes part of a greater plan.

1076
00:52:30,889 --> 00:52:33,270
And if more resources are invested in a setup,

1077
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:35,871
then it gains more chances to reach the quality

1078
00:52:35,891 --> 00:52:37,672
and content you originally wanted for it.

1079
00:52:38,052 --> 00:52:40,853
And that's something I didn't know before.

1080
00:52:40,893 --> 00:52:42,954
I thought I'm gonna do things on my own

1081
00:52:43,014 --> 00:52:45,675
and everything's gonna be fine, but really not.

1082
00:52:46,575 --> 00:52:48,576
And the last thing I'm gonna say,

1083
00:52:48,616 --> 00:52:49,556
and then I'm gonna be done,

1084
00:52:50,777 --> 00:52:52,817
is why so many secrets and why the fear?

1085
00:52:53,518 --> 00:52:55,238
Why did people from our direction

1086
00:52:55,578 --> 00:52:57,099
stumble upon locations that I did?

1087
00:52:57,199 --> 00:52:58,720
Why didn't they know everything?

1088
00:53:00,544 --> 00:53:05,326
It's the tricky part because things don't always go perfectly.

1089
00:53:05,386 --> 00:53:06,927
We have trouble communicating sometimes.

1090
00:53:07,067 --> 00:53:12,890
And in our case, we were feeling frustrated, the two of us, Jeff and me, the two designers

1091
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:18,833
on Prague, because everybody else was working on our vertical slice and we were, we spent

1092
00:53:18,873 --> 00:53:21,514
a long time alone with ourselves and it drove us a bit crazy.

1093
00:53:22,678 --> 00:53:27,259
And yes, we lost perspective on what we were doing.

1094
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,500
And we thought we had to do everything on our own

1095
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:31,280
and talk to no one.

1096
00:53:32,181 --> 00:53:35,881
And it's partly our fault, it's partly nobody's fault.

1097
00:53:36,261 --> 00:53:39,022
But there's also another lesson that I've learned,

1098
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:42,063
it's about the process of communicating things to people.

1099
00:53:42,563 --> 00:53:44,263
I was using this document, don't try to read it.

1100
00:53:45,704 --> 00:53:46,104
It's awful.

1101
00:53:46,464 --> 00:53:51,248
It's actually a working document that I made to detail every setup that I had.

1102
00:53:52,069 --> 00:53:57,073
And I made the naive mistake of sending this to everybody, asking them to read everything

1103
00:53:57,293 --> 00:53:59,475
and come back to me with...

1104
00:54:01,276 --> 00:54:06,141
And I was doing this document because I was feeling the need to justify myself all the

1105
00:54:06,161 --> 00:54:10,424
time because a lot of designer creating stories, doing things and trying to make things validated

1106
00:54:10,464 --> 00:54:11,025
by people.

1107
00:54:11,505 --> 00:54:16,029
It was making me very awkward with myself.

1108
00:54:17,825 --> 00:54:20,648
And I was overdesigning these things.

1109
00:54:20,668 --> 00:54:23,351
Overdesigning again sucks.

1110
00:54:24,913 --> 00:54:27,576
And now I learn from this that sending documents to people

1111
00:54:27,816 --> 00:54:30,640
and expecting them to read them and understand exactly what's

1112
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,681
in your head doesn't work.

1113
00:54:32,021 --> 00:54:34,104
And it took me a while to realize it.

1114
00:54:35,090 --> 00:54:37,633
So now this detailed document I keep for myself

1115
00:54:38,473 --> 00:54:41,736
and I use more of this summed up version

1116
00:54:42,657 --> 00:54:44,639
that I made up a long time later.

1117
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:47,021
I used this document, I was summing up pretty

1118
00:54:47,161 --> 00:54:49,043
what my intentions were for exploration content

1119
00:54:49,743 --> 00:54:52,386
and I knew that it resonates with Mary and Jeff

1120
00:54:52,466 --> 00:54:54,007
or creative director because they would,

1121
00:54:54,528 --> 00:54:57,270
they're interested in keeping our universe interesting

1122
00:54:58,111 --> 00:54:59,352
and yeah, short sentences.

1123
00:55:00,933 --> 00:55:01,033
And.

1124
00:55:03,224 --> 00:55:05,286
That's actually what my point is.

1125
00:55:06,087 --> 00:55:08,929
Is that I was criticizing control freaks.

1126
00:55:09,469 --> 00:55:09,710
Whoops.

1127
00:55:11,751 --> 00:55:11,932
Yeah.

1128
00:55:12,732 --> 00:55:14,454
But I became a control freak.

1129
00:55:14,474 --> 00:55:15,334
Every time someone would,

1130
00:55:16,135 --> 00:55:18,797
because the cavalry came in Prague later in the project.

1131
00:55:18,837 --> 00:55:20,959
Three years later, lots and lots of people

1132
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:23,281
came working on Prague and we were overwhelmed.

1133
00:55:23,501 --> 00:55:24,342
Me and Jeff, we were like,

1134
00:55:24,742 --> 00:55:26,244
what are these people doing to our stuff?

1135
00:55:26,264 --> 00:55:27,385
It was scary.

1136
00:55:28,566 --> 00:55:29,146
But in the end,

1137
00:55:31,888 --> 00:55:37,070
I was overprotective, but I learned more and more to detach myself from my work because

1138
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:41,853
it was just making me very sad, and it was not serving the project properly.

1139
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:45,035
And yeah, who created what, it doesn't matter in the end.

1140
00:55:45,995 --> 00:55:48,056
And I had to care about the work and not how I felt.

1141
00:55:49,077 --> 00:55:53,920
That's the important lesson and if I have to give some human experience takeaways about my

1142
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:00,685
four and a half years doing Prague, is that yeah, there's nothing magic. And the lessons are

1143
00:56:00,805 --> 00:56:06,209
designing for the 1% as I did a lot. It's okay as long as it doesn't take 100% of your time.

1144
00:56:07,149 --> 00:56:11,232
And it happened to me. I was thinking about it too much. Get back perspective and that

1145
00:56:11,272 --> 00:56:16,516
means letting go. Again, if you, it's a lot of ego. I wasn't realizing.

1146
00:56:17,817 --> 00:56:19,939
that it was an ego thing, but it actually was,

1147
00:56:19,979 --> 00:56:22,581
and I had to take a step back and think about

1148
00:56:23,222 --> 00:56:24,763
what my ideas could bring to the project

1149
00:56:24,823 --> 00:56:27,406
and that my ideas were not my own.

1150
00:56:27,986 --> 00:56:29,628
The beautiful thing that happens in video games

1151
00:56:29,848 --> 00:56:32,871
and any creative media is that ideas are cool on their own,

1152
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:34,032
but they only get interesting

1153
00:56:35,113 --> 00:56:38,216
when they travel into other people's brain.

1154
00:56:38,836 --> 00:56:40,338
And that's actually the last point.

1155
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:46,144
your ideas need to get dirty, driving into other people's mind and you stop being too

1156
00:56:46,184 --> 00:56:51,129
protective about them. And yeah, escape the intention to squeal all is an interesting

1157
00:56:51,189 --> 00:56:53,251
one because I was tempted a lot of times to just say it.

1158
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:56,251
Okay, screw you all.

1159
00:56:56,711 --> 00:56:58,974
I'm just gonna not, I'm just gonna give my minimum.

1160
00:56:59,754 --> 00:57:03,238
But, because I saw some of my colleagues,

1161
00:57:03,479 --> 00:57:05,060
I shouldn't say that, but some people I knew,

1162
00:57:05,661 --> 00:57:06,582
they just gave up trying.

1163
00:57:07,343 --> 00:57:08,564
And it was really depressing to see.

1164
00:57:09,145 --> 00:57:10,026
It was like they were broken,

1165
00:57:10,066 --> 00:57:11,768
and I was trying really hard not to be broken.

1166
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:14,250
And it's possible not to be broken if you,

1167
00:57:14,951 --> 00:57:16,513
yeah, if you put your mind into it.

1168
00:57:18,285 --> 00:57:19,427
And in the end, that's what I did.

1169
00:57:19,508 --> 00:57:21,994
I kept nagging people about everything

1170
00:57:22,555 --> 00:57:23,397
to make the game better,

1171
00:57:23,778 --> 00:57:25,462
because the game is not about what I feel.

1172
00:57:25,502 --> 00:57:27,648
It's about making the coolest experience you could ever have.

1173
00:57:28,883 --> 00:57:30,464
And in the end, it got good.

1174
00:57:30,884 --> 00:57:32,424
I had the help of a nice British guy

1175
00:57:32,464 --> 00:57:34,225
who came to help me at the very end,

1176
00:57:34,545 --> 00:57:39,647
and it's now a continuing collaboration that came late,

1177
00:57:39,767 --> 00:57:43,729
but hopefully it's gonna last for a long time.

1178
00:57:44,289 --> 00:57:46,830
So thank you, that's all I wanted to say,

1179
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:49,171
and thank you for all my teammates

1180
00:57:49,431 --> 00:57:51,392
for listening to this over and over again.

1181
00:57:53,133 --> 00:57:54,113
I will pay you many beers.
