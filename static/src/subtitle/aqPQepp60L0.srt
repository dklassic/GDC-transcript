00:00:05,864 --> 00:00:34,413
They're giving me the thumbs up. That means it's go time. Hey everybody, thank you so much for coming to the art of reanimating plants for zombies 2. I know there's a happy hour and a bunch of parties going on right now so just to see even one person, especially these guys up here. There's a pop cap party so my whole team isn't here except for these two. So the art of reanimating plants for zombies 2. First thing you got to know, who's the guy talking to you? I'm Mark Barrett

2
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:40,603
I'm a lead artist on Plants vs. Zombies 2. I'm an amateur power pointer. I'm a private

3
00:00:40,603 --> 00:00:45,103
dancer, a dancer for hire. And if you want to get a hold of me, you should take a picture

4
00:00:45,103 --> 00:00:49,284
or write this stuff down really, really quick. Or you can come talk to me after.

5
00:00:49,284 --> 00:00:56,505
This is the arts team of Plants vs. Zombies 2. They are good folks, but they are not to

6
00:00:56,505 --> 00:01:01,506
be trusted, especially with Photoshop. They told me, I took this picture, they said, don't

7
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:03,267
worry, we'll put you in there. And they did.

8
00:01:04,582 --> 00:01:09,103
So what do I mean by the art of reanimating? I was trying to make a pun but it's not great. A

9
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:15,326
zombie pun. The art of reanimating is a behind the scenes look at the art of Plants vs.

10
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:26,730
Zombies 2 and how we made the old new again. So to do that we have to talk about what is

11
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:34,353
Plants vs. Zombies. The basics are it's a casual tower defense style game. It's a

12
00:01:34,838 --> 00:01:38,522
As zombies move right to left across the screen and lanes to get to your house and eat your

13
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:45,968
brains, you stop that from happening by collecting sun, planting plants, and placing them strategically

14
00:01:45,968 --> 00:01:49,130
on the board to stop the zombie horde.

15
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,251
Didn't mean to rhyme that.

16
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:59,879
The game is set on and around your house in the suburbia with the help of your crazy neighbor

17
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,260
Dave.

18
00:02:00,964 --> 00:02:06,665
you can discover the source of the zombie scourge and hopefully stop it once and for all.

19
00:02:06,665 --> 00:02:16,567
Unless that game turns out to be a hit. In which case it was always a planned trilogy.

20
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:22,328
PZ was a hit. They did not expect that. And I can brag on it because it had very little to do

21
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:26,808
with it. It won over 30 game of the year awards. It got a 90% and still has a 90% on Metacritic

22
00:02:26,808 --> 00:02:30,449
and it is loved by millions of people including me.

23
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:33,610
Plants vs. Zombies is the reason why I work at PopCap.

24
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,553
It's the reason why I wanted to work at PopCap.

25
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:41,717
And as you know, when a game does really, really well, this happens.

26
00:02:41,717 --> 00:02:47,321
Yeah, that would be great.

27
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:54,287
But right away, there was a bit of a problem, a big problem.

28
00:02:54,287 --> 00:02:59,792
The original creative team behind Plants vs. Zombies had already worked on the game.

29
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:05,008
for more than half a decade, and they wanted to move on and do something new.

30
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:07,769
And thus began Amateur Hour.

31
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:12,811
I was a new hire, and we had a very small, very new team.

32
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:20,034
We were assembled and given mission papers, make a great sequel or die trying.

33
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:24,056
We were tasked to make a five-year-old game feel new again, and we had no idea how that

34
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:25,097
was done.

35
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:27,838
So we went to the shrine of Miyamoto and we prayed.

36
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:36,828
Nintendo makes it look sooo flippin' easy, but the truth is, reinventing a classic is a high wire act.

37
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:39,971
If you don't change it enough, then it's boring and it's unoriginal.

38
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:48,559
Change it just a little, but mess with the wrong element in the design, and it can make people really uncomfortable.

39
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:52,003
And if you change too much...

40
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:52,803
You're not a plumber.

41
00:03:54,915 --> 00:03:57,637
It was our mission not to let this happen to PBZ.

42
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:00,280
We committed ourselves to make a sequel that both honored

43
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,903
the original and improved as much as possible

44
00:04:03,903 --> 00:04:05,764
without becoming creepy porn stars.

45
00:04:05,764 --> 00:04:11,269
So if, standing here today, if I could go back in time

46
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:15,733
and hand myself a map, I, the map would say,

47
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:19,337
if you, the map on how to make Bloods for Zombies 2,

48
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:20,718
it would say four things.

49
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:25,673
It would say, make new plants, new zombies, new environments easy. That's obvious.

50
00:04:25,673 --> 00:04:31,434
Add plant food to give every plant a temporary boost, allowing users a chance to discover

51
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:35,995
new abilities hidden away in plants both old and new. And it's ridiculously fun.

52
00:04:35,995 --> 00:04:43,516
I would say, travel through time and explore an ever-expanding universe.

53
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:49,137
And I would say, design everything to be optimized for mobile and handheld.

54
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:50,898
And voila, PVZ2 is so obvious.

55
00:04:52,512 --> 00:04:59,295
But the truth is, at first, we had no idea what the hell we were doing.

56
00:04:59,295 --> 00:05:04,978
And so, we turned to what seemed at the time to be the most obvious choice, a farm.

57
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:07,199
Because hey, plants grow on a farm.

58
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,981
Farmville was exceptionally hot at the time, and the idea of doing seasons sounded amazing.

59
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:19,245
We thought you could have a barn, and instead of lawnmowers, you could have animals, like

60
00:05:19,245 --> 00:05:22,166
a goat and a cow, because they chew grass like a lawnmower does.

61
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:29,091
and it can attack the zombies, or maybe the zombies kidnap the animals and you rescue

62
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:34,812
the animals from zombies. After all, animals have brains too. The chickens would have little

63
00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:40,314
tiny peanut brains for zombies to snack on. But we didn't really want to call the game

64
00:05:40,314 --> 00:05:45,335
plants and animals versus zombies. And that did not stop us from designing zombie tractors.

65
00:05:45,335 --> 00:05:50,817
Because at that period, every idea was awesome.

66
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:56,748
It sounded great, so we got down to business and started drawing up farm zombies.

67
00:05:56,748 --> 00:06:05,293
We always start with a rough sketch exploration, and I was really inspired by the art from

68
00:06:05,293 --> 00:06:11,357
that Tim Burton movie, Corpse Bride. They drew on the back of cereal boxes, so I scanned

69
00:06:11,357 --> 00:06:14,739
in the cereal box and drew on the back of it in Photoshop. Very nerdy.

70
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:21,043
We choose the best one of these rough designs, and then we do a full color sketch of the

71
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:28,322
ideas that we see have promise. And this guy on the left, he can throw a plant around anywhere on

72
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:34,265
the board and the guy on the right, he puts that scarecrow down when he is defeated and that

73
00:06:34,265 --> 00:06:41,608
acts as a shield for the plants coming up behind, or for the zombies coming up behind him. So

74
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:47,910
you can see we got pretty far along with these guys. Our first problem with the farm setting

75
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,912
seems really obvious now, almost so obvious that I'm actually embarrassed.

76
00:06:51,674 --> 00:06:54,936
But it turns out people generally have a pretty limited

77
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:57,597
number of images in their head when they think of farm.

78
00:06:57,597 --> 00:07:01,060
And when you're designing a zombie,

79
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,481
the most important thing you want to give the player

80
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:07,844
is a visual sign as to what each zombie will do.

81
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,666
Some of those metaphors, like pitchfork and scarecrow,

82
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,627
work awesome.

83
00:07:11,627 --> 00:07:15,349
But sometimes the most obvious visual metaphor

84
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:18,531
was not necessarily very farmy.

85
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:19,632
So it was a bit of a battle

86
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:21,153
between mechanics and appearance.

87
00:07:23,388 --> 00:07:25,830
And another problem you can see in these early zombie drawings

88
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:31,195
is that I've already crossed the line as far as retaining the spirit of the original game.

89
00:07:31,195 --> 00:07:33,917
Ask a stranger on the street what the character on the left is from

90
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:35,599
and they would say,

91
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,359
Plants vs. Zombies!

92
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:38,201
They've seen it. They know it.

93
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:39,582
They probably love it.

94
00:07:39,582 --> 00:07:42,604
But ask them what game the guy on the right is from,

95
00:07:42,604 --> 00:07:44,186
they would have no idea.

96
00:07:44,186 --> 00:07:45,527
It's a completely different zombie.

97
00:07:45,527 --> 00:07:48,389
In trying to make something new

98
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:50,431
and maybe bringing a little vanity to the table,

99
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:51,372
I changed everything.

100
00:07:51,817 --> 00:07:54,817
and in changing everything I made it unrecognizable.

101
00:07:54,817 --> 00:07:59,098
The style and the zombies were not our only difficulty.

102
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:03,079
On a farm, you have a house or a barn, but anywhere else,

103
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,479
and you really don't have a dwelling for the player's brains

104
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:06,259
to hide inside.

105
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,379
And on a farm, there's a lot of open field.

106
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:11,740
You can see three of my four concepts are in an open field.

107
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,440
And if a zombie gets from the right side of an open field

108
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,081
to the left side of an open field,

109
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:17,361
there's not a lot of drama.

110
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:20,802
So you can see there's a lot of cool ideas.

111
00:08:22,606 --> 00:08:25,288
But we would have to go back to a farmhouse again,

112
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:27,450
and that seemed too much like the original.

113
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,172
And we didn't want to make Plants vs. Zombies 1.5.

114
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:32,613
We wanted to make the two.

115
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:37,277
Really, the only thing that was working for us on the farm

116
00:08:37,277 --> 00:08:39,058
is the thing that gave us the idea of a farm,

117
00:08:39,058 --> 00:08:41,120
and that was the plants.

118
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,702
We found the plants, though, to work just about anywhere.

119
00:08:44,702 --> 00:08:48,665
These are my very first drawings.

120
00:08:49,268 --> 00:08:50,329
on Plants vs. Zombies 2, period.

121
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,950
They said, hey, why don't you draw some plants?

122
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,971
We'll see.

123
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:55,293
Maybe there's a project in the works for you.

124
00:08:55,293 --> 00:08:56,474
So I went all out.

125
00:08:56,474 --> 00:08:59,416
And these were a lot of fun to draw,

126
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:02,118
but they are not quite PVZ.

127
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:03,819
So I went back to the original lineup.

128
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:07,702
And if basic zombie is the baseline of Plants vs. Zombies,

129
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:10,164
then these three plants are the melody.

130
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:13,486
And if we mess these up, then it wouldn't matter

131
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,448
if we got everything else right.

132
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:17,549
So they were really a great place

133
00:09:17,549 --> 00:09:18,770
to start when learning.

134
00:09:19,777 --> 00:09:21,958
how and where to break the two.

135
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,619
In creating new versions of an old character,

136
00:09:25,619 --> 00:09:28,560
it actually is useful to intentionally break it sometimes.

137
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,202
It can help you discover what the core elements are.

138
00:09:32,202 --> 00:09:35,583
And once you find the limits on that character,

139
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,824
you can really hone in on areas

140
00:09:37,824 --> 00:09:40,665
you might be able to make it better.

141
00:09:40,665 --> 00:09:43,686
So for PVZ2, we knew we were moving to mobile,

142
00:09:43,686 --> 00:09:46,127
and we decided to switch from an illustrative style

143
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:46,867
of the original.

144
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,657
to a much more graphic, easier to read at a small size

145
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,778
vector asset created in Flash.

146
00:09:52,778 --> 00:09:55,640
And the original, I've kind of outlined,

147
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,903
illustrative I mean, hand drawn in Photoshop,

148
00:09:58,903 --> 00:10:01,965
varying line thickness, it has lots of small,

149
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:04,487
nuanced details, and it's not optimal for animation,

150
00:10:04,487 --> 00:10:07,529
it's designed to be an illustration.

151
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:10,031
In a graphic style, we work in Flash,

152
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:14,214
the lines in Flash are math based, so they're consistent.

153
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,315
We colored those lines.

154
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:20,438
We kept clean, simple shapes and made them more efficient for animation.

155
00:10:20,438 --> 00:10:25,903
And this outlines some of the major stylistic differences.

156
00:10:25,903 --> 00:10:31,147
And that was led mostly by what looks great on a small screen.

157
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:34,649
There is the same slide I think, just with a couple more words.

158
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:40,614
So with that in mind, I kept the changes minor.

159
00:10:41,288 --> 00:10:42,549
but still meaningful.

160
00:10:42,549 --> 00:10:45,211
In redesigning Sunflower, one thing I wanted to do

161
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:47,753
was brighten her up, make her silhouette

162
00:10:47,753 --> 00:10:49,795
look more like a sun.

163
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:53,739
And I knew that she was going to be happy.

164
00:10:53,739 --> 00:10:54,980
And I refer to her as a she.

165
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,760
She could be whatever you want.

166
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,543
But I wanted her to have little petal arms

167
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:02,826
that she could wiggle whenever she made a sun for the player.

168
00:11:02,826 --> 00:11:03,707
So that's what that's all about.

169
00:11:03,707 --> 00:11:07,290
Here's the same progression with Peashooter.

170
00:11:07,866 --> 00:11:11,248
And another thing that we did that really helps with appeal,

171
00:11:11,248 --> 00:11:12,968
I kind of learned from Pixar, is you just

172
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:15,610
pump the characters full of air, like a balloon,

173
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,531
to make them rounder and more dimensional.

174
00:11:17,531 --> 00:11:21,412
And that's useful for animation as well as

175
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:24,794
creating physical merchandise later down the line,

176
00:11:24,794 --> 00:11:25,214
like toys, et cetera.

177
00:11:25,214 --> 00:11:27,215
And for the walnut, I was absolutely

178
00:11:27,215 --> 00:11:32,278
determined to make it look less like a potato.

179
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:35,399
Everyone calls the original walnut potato.

180
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:39,193
I failed though, because it still happens.

181
00:11:39,193 --> 00:11:43,636
Some people said the chubby wrinkles on the one second to the left

182
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:46,338
made him look soft when he's supposed to look hard like a nut.

183
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,080
And other people said he looked too much like a scrotum.

184
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,384
And after that, I really didn't mind so much if they called him Potato.

185
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:59,308
Since the plants were the only thing that were really working on the farm,

186
00:11:59,308 --> 00:12:01,570
and we knew they could work basically anywhere,

187
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,872
we decided to throw them in a suitcase and head out on a road trip.

188
00:12:06,723 --> 00:12:11,267
With Crazy Dave as our whacked out navigator, we hopped in an RV and hit the road across the

189
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:20,795
United States. No, the world. This idea was great, but really short lived. We did a few

190
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:26,980
explorations, football stadiums, Paris, Egypt, but Egypt is where we stopped with that one.

191
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:32,564
Because Egypt is where we really got somewhere. You see that on the right? That is more than

192
00:12:32,564 --> 00:12:33,825
blatant copyright infringement.

193
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:39,316
That, my friends, is a sweet, beautiful, interdimensional time warp.

194
00:12:39,316 --> 00:12:43,918
And that turned out to be the perfect theme for Plants vs. Zombies 2.

195
00:12:43,918 --> 00:12:49,482
I submit to you, if you can choose any theme for your game, that time travel...

196
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:49,822
Excellent!

197
00:12:49,822 --> 00:12:51,683
...is the most excellent theme.

198
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:54,805
That cue came a little later.

199
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:55,365
Yes.

200
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:55,485
Um...

201
00:12:55,485 --> 00:13:03,110
Time travel was perfect because each new time period...

202
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:06,165
allowed us to put a fresh coat of paint

203
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:08,267
on all of the original mechanics.

204
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:12,611
For example, the game board has three basic elements,

205
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:15,214
house on the left, grid in the middle,

206
00:13:15,214 --> 00:13:17,096
a place for zombies to come from on the right.

207
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:20,759
We matched those elements, improved them meaningfully.

208
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:21,440
Here the only real changes

209
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,942
are muting the background color

210
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:26,064
so the characters pop off a little more

211
00:13:26,064 --> 00:13:28,946
and give ourselves more space for user interface.

212
00:13:31,098 --> 00:13:32,859
Little shout out to George Fan and Rich Warner

213
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:34,480
down there in the corner,

214
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,340
the original designer and artist.

215
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:40,403
Anyway, after you reestablish that feeling of familiarity,

216
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:45,645
of being home with the player,

217
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:46,866
then you can do anything.

218
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:48,487
You can theme it,

219
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:51,308
you can create totally new mechanics,

220
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:54,210
totally new experiences,

221
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,330
and for us, as I said,

222
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,432
the theme of time travel worked remarkably well.

223
00:14:02,418 --> 00:14:08,782
In updating the classic basic zombie, we gave it a larger head that's easier to see on smaller

224
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:17,987
devices and simpler feet to animate. And that's it. Less is sometimes way, way, way more. If you

225
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:23,690
ask somebody what that character on the right is, they'll say plants versus zombies. I don't

226
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,892
know if they'd even be able to tell you if it was one or two. I hope they would know it's two.

227
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:31,635
I worked really hard. So before...

228
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:37,979
with the farm and with the road trip even.

229
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:40,321
We were trying to reinvent everything

230
00:14:40,321 --> 00:14:44,943
and we thought that that was how you made it new.

231
00:14:44,943 --> 00:14:47,805
We replaced one thing with another.

232
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:49,586
So we replaced the cone with a boot,

233
00:14:49,586 --> 00:14:53,348
replaced the bucket with a slightly crappier bucket.

234
00:14:53,348 --> 00:14:54,589
That was wrong.

235
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,590
We came to not only understand,

236
00:14:56,590 --> 00:15:00,532
but embrace that the original already established

237
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,193
a strong visual language.

238
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:08,172
the players understood and responded positively to. And if you have that, if you're lucky

239
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:13,694
enough to get that in a game, that's what makes it a hit. Don't replace it. For us, we found

240
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:21,498
you can theme it. Basic zombie themed. There's a new one up here, by the way. Coming very

241
00:15:21,498 --> 00:15:29,861
soon. Same head, same pose, always wears a tie around his neck, but theming the basic

242
00:15:29,861 --> 00:15:32,062
zombie through the different time periods.

243
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:35,665
makes each one new and exciting for the player.

244
00:15:35,665 --> 00:15:37,747
And from a development standpoint, it's awesome,

245
00:15:37,747 --> 00:15:40,029
because it's just a reskin for us.

246
00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:42,291
But it adds to our entire cast of our game.

247
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,993
It makes it a much richer experience.

248
00:15:44,993 --> 00:15:46,574
And it feels like a two.

249
00:15:46,574 --> 00:15:52,879
It gave us so many new takes on old characters

250
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,202
that it earned us the right and the room

251
00:15:56,202 --> 00:15:57,723
to create a bunch of new ones.

252
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:03,733
And I think that we were successful.

253
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:07,135
I think we have made, and are continuing to make,

254
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:12,098
a really fun, really amazing, and hopefully worthy sequel.

255
00:16:12,098 --> 00:16:14,220
That was our job when we started out.

256
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,462
I wanted the plants that I brought to PVZ

257
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:20,544
to fit with the plants that were already there.

258
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:23,606
And I quiver a little bit to say that.

259
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:26,468
It was really an amazing experience.

260
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:28,790
So the key takeaways that I would give.

261
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:34,124
to the artists in this room who inherit a mega hit game

262
00:16:34,124 --> 00:16:36,305
that you're asked to make the art for a sequel for.

263
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:38,445
I know that's a very specific audience.

264
00:16:38,445 --> 00:16:40,626
Key takeaways.

265
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:44,508
Figure out the core elements of your game

266
00:16:44,508 --> 00:16:47,609
and do not replace them.

267
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:51,071
Find ways to optimize for the platforms you're working on

268
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:53,552
that will lead you to meaningful improvements.

269
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:58,273
Choose the right theme for your needs.

270
00:16:58,481 --> 00:17:03,923
Not the theme that sounds most obvious. Don't get attached right away. And once the player feels

271
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:10,906
that sense of home, only then can you add the new stuff. Now I know what you're thinking. That was

272
00:17:10,906 --> 00:17:20,589
a very short talk. Because it's awesome. I just gave my first GDC talk and I hope you enjoyed

273
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:26,892
it. But there's some bonus materials. I just wanted to really quickly thank my team for their

274
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:27,892
hard work and their friendship.

275
00:17:28,526 --> 00:17:30,387
They are amazing people.

276
00:17:30,387 --> 00:17:35,288
I wanted to thank the original PVZ team for creating a dream game to work on, and PopCap

277
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:39,570
for trusting me with the opportunity to make the sequel.

278
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,251
So I'll show you some bonus materials.

279
00:17:42,251 --> 00:17:43,251
Because I think it's awesome.

280
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:43,652
I'm an artist.

281
00:17:43,652 --> 00:17:48,533
This is what I love to see from other artists.

282
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:52,635
And then hopefully we'll have a little bit of time for questions.

283
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:58,148
So these were just some early sketches.

284
00:17:58,148 --> 00:17:59,729
This is just a smorgasbord of stuff, guys.

285
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:02,329
But this is an environment exploration.

286
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:05,390
These were some of Augie's very first sketches

287
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,751
on how we would travel around in time.

288
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:11,551
And that brought about the very, very crazy idea

289
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:15,032
of an RV that travels through time.

290
00:18:15,032 --> 00:18:19,753
A lot of vis dev goes into those background environments.

291
00:18:19,753 --> 00:18:23,114
They have about 16 different kinds of perspective

292
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:24,414
going on at once.

293
00:18:24,414 --> 00:18:25,875
And it is very, very difficult.

294
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:30,066
to make those look believable.

295
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:31,988
So I wanted to show just a little bit of his work.

296
00:18:31,988 --> 00:18:34,369
And then I kind of wanted to take you guys through

297
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:37,771
the basic design process of a zombie

298
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:41,654
and the basic design process of a plant, how we do that.

299
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,655
At least how we did it on this game.

300
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,217
So we start with a design idea.

301
00:18:47,217 --> 00:18:50,339
Like every zombie should represent,

302
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,980
hopefully just a single mechanic,

303
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,301
and every plant should represent

304
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:55,622
a corresponding opposite.

305
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:59,159
mechanic, and those two complement each other.

306
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:06,581
So this was some of the early sketches for Parrot, or Captain Zombie.

307
00:19:06,581 --> 00:19:14,383
And you can see, real quickly, he just has a bird on his shoulder that he shields, and

308
00:19:14,383 --> 00:19:18,104
that flies off and steals your plants, and it's incredibly annoying.

309
00:19:18,104 --> 00:19:20,424
And I actually did the voice acting for that bird.

310
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:24,365
This is our first sketch of it.

311
00:19:25,312 --> 00:19:31,274
That is a heinous bird. It has crapped all over his shoulder. It's not a great silhouette and

312
00:19:31,274 --> 00:19:38,218
also this doesn't look great. Plants vs. Zombies 2. So polish him up a little bit. Get him

313
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:45,721
vectorized. As you can see, this is more illustrative, more graphic. And then show you guys

314
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:48,603
some of the animation. These are all loops.

315
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:58,201
We put little action tags in Flash that call this out,

316
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:00,804
and the programmer just calls that action out

317
00:20:00,804 --> 00:20:02,725
when it's needed for the zombie.

318
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:06,709
Now this is a plant that actually didn't end up in our game,

319
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:08,771
but did end up in PVZ Adventures,

320
00:20:08,771 --> 00:20:12,674
and it's one of the first new plants we ever drew.

321
00:20:12,674 --> 00:20:14,816
And the idea for him was a short-range attack

322
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:19,440
that was extremely powerful, but had a cool-down afterwards.

323
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:22,810
and he kind of ended up turning into Bonk Choy,

324
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:25,592
but originally he was a beet.

325
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:28,595
And so you have that mechanic,

326
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:31,497
then you have to skin that mechanic

327
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:35,139
in whatever way looks the best, honestly,

328
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:36,960
that still matches the PVZ theme.

329
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,625
And you can see in this little roundup of sketches,

330
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:47,568
we have some early pea-shooters, sunflower, walnut,

331
00:20:47,568 --> 00:20:48,368
and zombie down there.

332
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,721
That one in the middle was picked.

333
00:20:51,721 --> 00:20:53,561
Most people agreed that looks like a plant that

334
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:55,462
belongs in our universe.

335
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,303
And it looks like he could do that kind of attack.

336
00:20:58,303 --> 00:21:00,364
So we do a full color illustration,

337
00:21:00,364 --> 00:21:02,024
vectorize that, and animate it.

338
00:21:02,024 --> 00:21:03,345
And we changed him.

339
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,406
Instead of smacking his head around,

340
00:21:05,406 --> 00:21:06,506
we decided he would do an uppercut,

341
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:09,587
knock the enemy off the screen, and then

342
00:21:09,587 --> 00:21:12,148
take a little while to cool down,

343
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:13,869
and then come back to life.

344
00:21:13,869 --> 00:21:15,850
And yeah, there he is.

345
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,430
He made it after all.

346
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,911
I was really happy to see that.

347
00:21:19,917 --> 00:21:30,123
Alright, that is my talk. We probably have a lot of time for questions. I talked a little bit

348
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:36,327
fast. So, shoot, go ahead. Until they give me the warning, I'm happy. Thank you. Thank you

349
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:43,511
very much.

350
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:47,393
By the way, I can't see any of you, so, yeah, go ahead.

351
00:21:53,008 --> 00:22:01,657
Let me stop you. They told me to specifically ask people to go to the microphone so that people listening in the vault could hear this question later.

352
00:22:01,657 --> 00:22:02,017
Got you OJ.

353
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:08,855
Great presentation.

354
00:22:08,855 --> 00:22:09,516
Thank you very much.

355
00:22:09,516 --> 00:22:13,519
Did you have to do any negotiations with development

356
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:15,401
on how to optimize?

357
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:21,685
How just to make all of these cool ambient animations

358
00:22:21,685 --> 00:22:23,327
or reactions work?

359
00:22:23,327 --> 00:22:27,330
Did you ever have to like call some of that

360
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,050
and dial it down a notch?

361
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,073
Yeah, yeah, quite a bit actually.

362
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:34,875
You know, in our game, there are.

363
00:22:35,738 --> 00:23:03,806
gets a point where a crazy amount is going on at the screen. So the interesting part is it's not for memory reasons that we would have to sometimes take our special effects in particular way back. It was just to keep the game from feeling too chaotic to the player in that end game scenario when you have as many plants as you can get on the board and there's as many zombies as possible coming at them. If, and that's one reason why

364
00:23:04,628 --> 00:23:08,730
a very simplistic graphic style works so well for this game.

365
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:13,871
The more detail and the more animation you add to it,

366
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:19,033
the more that visual noise can start to become too much

367
00:23:19,033 --> 00:23:19,813
for the player.

368
00:23:19,813 --> 00:23:23,034
And so we did have a few things that's like, all right,

369
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,975
that looks really cool by itself.

370
00:23:24,975 --> 00:23:28,756
But once you see that done by 30 plants at the same time,

371
00:23:28,756 --> 00:23:29,456
it won't work.

372
00:23:29,456 --> 00:23:29,616
Yeah.

373
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,797
Good question.

374
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:38,855
If you've conquered time travel, what do you do for a third?

375
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:43,216
You tell me, because I really want to know.

376
00:23:43,216 --> 00:23:48,637
So I mean, we're making the cool thing about Games as a Service

377
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:51,518
and time travel, which I submit is the most excellent theme,

378
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:57,639
is there are so many places we can still go and make

379
00:23:57,639 --> 00:24:00,760
the game brand new at each one of those turns.

380
00:24:02,277 --> 00:24:05,420
Yeah, but nope, that thought is in the back of my head,

381
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,042
and it's a question I'm trying to answer,

382
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:10,505
but I don't have an answer for you right now.

383
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:12,086
Next is future, though.

384
00:24:12,086 --> 00:24:13,608
The future is where we're going next.

385
00:24:13,608 --> 00:24:14,149
Is that it?

386
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:18,613
If you guys are hungry, I'm hungry too.

387
00:24:18,613 --> 00:24:20,075
All right, well, we'll call it good.

388
00:24:20,075 --> 00:24:23,298
Thank you very much.
