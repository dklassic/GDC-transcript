1
00:00:06,093 --> 00:00:09,414
My name is Lucas Leminski, and I'm a senior concept artist

2
00:00:09,434 --> 00:00:10,854
for ZeniMax Online Studios.

3
00:00:11,995 --> 00:00:12,755
Hold on one second.

4
00:00:13,675 --> 00:00:14,996
I jumped the gun on myself here.

5
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:24,219
Okay, here we go.

6
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:24,799
Okay.

7
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:28,120
Yeah, I'm a senior concept artist for ZeniMax Online Studios

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,541
where my main responsibility is producing

9
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:32,642
key art illustrations for The Elder Scrolls Online.

10
00:00:34,624 --> 00:00:38,388
And just to give you a bit of background on myself before we get started, I originally

11
00:00:38,408 --> 00:00:42,032
went to college for illustration at Syracuse University in upstate New York.

12
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:47,137
A lot of Syracuse fans next door.

13
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:52,984
And although Syracuse is a great school, their traditional media curriculum didn't really

14
00:00:53,024 --> 00:00:56,908
prepare me for a career as a concept artist, which had always been my primary career goal.

15
00:00:57,706 --> 00:01:00,127
So after Syracuse, I decided to go to grad school

16
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:01,787
at the Savannah College of Art and Design,

17
00:01:02,287 --> 00:01:05,649
where I focused more specifically on 3D art for games.

18
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:09,690
And shortly after graduating from SCAD,

19
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,310
I was hired at Turbine in Boston,

20
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,971
where I worked on The Lord of the Rings Online

21
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:16,672
and a short-lived DC Comics MOBA called Infinite Crisis.

22
00:01:17,572 --> 00:01:19,533
And then in 2015, I moved to Baltimore

23
00:01:19,573 --> 00:01:21,033
to work for ZeniMax Online Studios,

24
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:22,834
where I've been painting the key art illustrations

25
00:01:22,914 --> 00:01:24,515
for The Elder Scrolls Online ever since.

26
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:26,315
And...

27
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:30,956
I imagine a lot of you are familiar with the game, but in case you're not, I'm just going

28
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:34,778
to give a bit of background on the Elder Scrolls Online, or ESO for short.

29
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:40,681
Our game is an MMO set in the Elder Scrolls universe, taking place about a thousand years

30
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:41,881
before the events of Skyrim.

31
00:01:43,022 --> 00:01:47,624
But unlike preceding Elder Scrolls titles, ESO is not developed by Bethesda, but by one

32
00:01:47,644 --> 00:01:52,506
of its sister companies, ZeniMax Online Studios, or as we call it on the dev team, ZOS.

33
00:01:53,505 --> 00:01:55,787
The game launched on PC in 2014

34
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:58,449
and on Xbox and PlayStation in 2015.

35
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,532
It currently has around a million monthly active players

36
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:04,654
and we continue to support that player population

37
00:02:04,694 --> 00:02:05,955
with a regular release cadence

38
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:08,477
of four major content updates per year.

39
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:11,299
And as part of the marketing campaign for each update,

40
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:13,861
Zost tasks me with producing a highly detailed,

41
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:15,902
hand-painted digital illustration in-house.

42
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:18,084
And of course, that's what we're here to talk about.

43
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:22,024
So my goal for today is to give you a peek

44
00:02:22,064 --> 00:02:23,204
behind the curtain at ZAS,

45
00:02:23,304 --> 00:02:25,845
showing the process I use to create these illustrations

46
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:29,306
and the various competing influences other than me

47
00:02:29,366 --> 00:02:31,907
that ultimately shape the outcome of the final artwork.

48
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:35,108
So more specifically, first I'm gonna try to clarify

49
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:38,169
exactly what I mean when I refer to key art for ESO,

50
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:40,449
plus how it's used to support the game

51
00:02:40,529 --> 00:02:42,550
and the main parameters we use to evaluate

52
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,730
the success of completed marketing illustrations.

53
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:47,711
From there, I'm going to show some examples

54
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:48,932
of how I try to balance

55
00:02:49,524 --> 00:02:52,045
the sometimes contradictory demands of the various parties

56
00:02:52,085 --> 00:02:53,245
that have a stake in the key art.

57
00:02:53,745 --> 00:02:56,206
And once we understand how they serve to limit my options

58
00:02:56,226 --> 00:02:57,366
when designing compositions,

59
00:02:57,446 --> 00:03:00,107
I'm going to dig really deep into the details

60
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,527
of some of the strategies that I use

61
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:02,928
for visually crafting narrative

62
00:03:03,348 --> 00:03:04,848
within single image illustrations.

63
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:07,189
And then finally, I'll try to show

64
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:08,989
how I put all those ideas into practice

65
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:10,810
by walking through the full production process

66
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,350
for one of my completed illustrations.

67
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,411
It's an ambitious itinerary,

68
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:17,012
and we're already on the clock, so let's get started.

69
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,280
Key art is a term that can mean a lot of different things

70
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,401
in different contexts, so rather than get stuck

71
00:03:23,641 --> 00:03:26,222
in the weeds on terminology, I wanted to find key art

72
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:28,782
solely according to the way we use the term on ESO.

73
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:32,023
When we talk about key art at Zoss,

74
00:03:32,243 --> 00:03:34,264
we're specifically referring to the illustrations

75
00:03:34,304 --> 00:03:36,164
that we use to market new content releases

76
00:03:36,204 --> 00:03:37,284
for the Elder Scrolls Online.

77
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:39,385
They're single images intended to be

78
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:41,145
the primary visual representation

79
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:42,906
of the content release they each accompany.

80
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:45,506
So basically, you can think of key art

81
00:03:45,647 --> 00:03:48,287
as the rough equivalent of box art, but for a digital game.

82
00:03:50,156 --> 00:03:54,962
The key art is featured on the ESO website and gets used in ad banners across the internet.

83
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:59,947
And they're also released as desktop backgrounds and promotional posters at conventions and

84
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:00,688
other fan events.

85
00:04:03,403 --> 00:04:09,107
And just to be clear, I should mention that the marketing campaign for ESO's big annual expansion in the second quarter of each year

86
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:16,651
also includes a cinematic trailer, a logo refresh, and a CG key art banner, which are all built using CG 3D assets.

87
00:04:17,232 --> 00:04:21,134
All that stuff is outsourced to creative agencies, which means I'm not involved in their production.

88
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:25,777
So for the purposes of this presentation, I'm not going to be including any of these within our definition of key art,

89
00:04:26,178 --> 00:04:28,299
and we're just going to be pretending that these things don't even exist.

90
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:34,700
Okay, so this is what the key art production process looks like at the broadest level.

91
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,642
We start with two to three weeks of planning and development, where I research the story

92
00:04:39,102 --> 00:04:43,644
and iterate on several rounds of comps, short for compositional sketches, before getting

93
00:04:43,664 --> 00:04:45,745
the green light to go ahead with a particular composition.

94
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:51,828
I then move on to the main production phase in earnest, which usually takes about six

95
00:04:51,888 --> 00:04:52,148
weeks.

96
00:04:52,548 --> 00:04:56,370
So the whole process takes about eight weeks in total, which is a really long time to spend

97
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,892
working on a single illustration, and nobody knows that more than I do.

98
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,882
However, my art director prefers that I focus on realism

99
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:07,484
and detail rather than speed, and he likes me

100
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:09,725
to take a constructive approach to figure production.

101
00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:12,367
And because of the variety of potential use cases

102
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:15,128
for the key art, I also paint it at a very high resolution

103
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,110
which allows for smaller areas to be repurposed

104
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:19,991
for different uses in the future.

105
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:21,612
And all of these things contribute

106
00:05:21,632 --> 00:05:23,073
to a longer production time frame.

107
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:30,298
And since Zoss invests so much into these images,

108
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,931
and they feature so prominently in the way the game is presented to the public,

109
00:05:34,231 --> 00:05:37,353
the key art sits at the intersection of various competing interests,

110
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:42,355
and the stakeholders for those interests each get varying degrees of input into its development.

111
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:50,339
So traditionally, it's more typical for a studio to outsource the production of marketing assets like key art to a freelance illustrator.

112
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:53,495
or a creative agency, and the discrete nature

113
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,276
of that vendor-client relationship forces

114
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:58,078
all revision requests through a single point of contact,

115
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:00,620
usually represented by a marketing art director

116
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,462
who is typically not the same person that's in charge

117
00:06:03,702 --> 00:06:05,223
of the in-house game dev art team.

118
00:06:06,023 --> 00:06:07,765
But because I produce the key art in-house

119
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:09,126
as a member of the development team,

120
00:06:09,606 --> 00:06:11,527
our art director at Zoss is able to exert

121
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:12,888
a much more direct influence

122
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:14,229
over the final look of the key art,

123
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,531
which tends to result in the illustrations.

124
00:06:17,286 --> 00:06:19,767
more effectively intimating that same character and tone

125
00:06:19,807 --> 00:06:21,549
that's shared by the rest of our game's content.

126
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,791
But it also means that I'm more directly confronted

127
00:06:24,831 --> 00:06:26,172
by the needs of different stakeholders

128
00:06:26,192 --> 00:06:28,054
than I would be under the traditional freelance model.

129
00:06:28,414 --> 00:06:30,395
So let's diagram those stakeholders

130
00:06:30,715 --> 00:06:32,237
and my relationship to them.

131
00:06:33,397 --> 00:06:35,919
As the illustrator, I sit in the center of this diagram

132
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,402
and the ESO art director represents my primary source

133
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:40,423
of critique and feedback.

134
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:43,445
But he's only one of several members of management

135
00:06:43,465 --> 00:06:45,406
that get a say in which of my comps

136
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,467
is approved for production.

137
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:53,905
I call this group the executive team, and it includes Zas's studio director, the general

138
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:59,149
manager, and finally the Elder Scrolls brand manager who works at Bethesda and represents

139
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:00,129
their marketing department.

140
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,653
Each member of the executive team has de facto veto power over any of my compositions.

141
00:07:06,874 --> 00:07:11,617
My art director insulates me from direct communication with the other executives as much as possible

142
00:07:11,657 --> 00:07:14,739
so that he represents the single source of directorial feedback for me.

143
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,542
Now, in one sense, this is really helpful

144
00:07:17,642 --> 00:07:19,183
because I'm not faced with the challenge

145
00:07:19,223 --> 00:07:20,924
of reconciling contradictory requests

146
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:22,626
after submitting each round of sketches,

147
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:24,807
but on the other hand, when my art director

148
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:27,810
has to relay feedback on behalf of the other executives,

149
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,552
it can sometimes be tough to determine the essence

150
00:07:30,572 --> 00:07:32,873
of the original critique that I really need to respond to.

151
00:07:33,574 --> 00:07:34,915
It also makes it impossible for me

152
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:37,036
to advocate for my own concerns directly,

153
00:07:37,096 --> 00:07:39,858
so I have to rely solely on my art director's impulse

154
00:07:39,878 --> 00:07:42,340
to push back against decisions that I might not agree with.

155
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:47,024
I also get content-related input from the ESO Loremaster,

156
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:49,166
and yes, that is his actual job title.

157
00:07:50,027 --> 00:07:51,788
And he ensures that nothing I'm including

158
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:54,630
in the illustration contradicts rules previously established

159
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,332
in other parts of the Elder Scrolls universe.

160
00:07:57,473 --> 00:07:59,074
So while the left side of this diagram

161
00:07:59,134 --> 00:08:00,435
is full of stakeholders telling me

162
00:08:00,695 --> 00:08:02,156
what the key art needs to look like,

163
00:08:02,296 --> 00:08:04,919
the right side will represent downstream dependencies

164
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:05,479
for the key art.

165
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:07,340
And none of the stakeholders on this side

166
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,962
have directorial oversight of my work,

167
00:08:09,002 --> 00:08:11,804
but they do each need me to hit particular benchmarks.

168
00:08:12,697 --> 00:08:14,858
to facilitate their own uses for the artwork.

169
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:17,719
So the creative services team needs the key art

170
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:19,579
to conform to specific technical parameters

171
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,860
so that they can process it for various use cases

172
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,181
before handing it off to the web team,

173
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:25,961
which publishes it on the ESO website,

174
00:08:26,322 --> 00:08:28,362
along with promotional copy written by ESO

175
00:08:28,422 --> 00:08:30,203
community managers who use the key art

176
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:32,183
to help frame the focus of their content

177
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:34,964
while also sharing the key art in social media posts.

178
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:40,326
Meanwhile, my producer manages and enforces my deadline.

179
00:08:40,783 --> 00:08:42,404
in concert with the lead concept artist

180
00:08:42,484 --> 00:08:45,425
who really functions as my manager

181
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:47,206
and helps to facilitate my interactions

182
00:08:47,246 --> 00:08:47,887
with the other teams.

183
00:08:48,747 --> 00:08:50,148
So with all of these parties involved,

184
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,489
my task in creating key art sadly isn't as simple

185
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:53,669
as just painting a pretty picture.

186
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,691
In fact, in addition to the technical specs

187
00:08:57,731 --> 00:08:59,252
required by the key art's eventual use,

188
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:03,013
the content of what I paint is more broadly guided

189
00:09:03,053 --> 00:09:04,974
by a series of persistent marketing goals.

190
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:07,874
And we use these as parameters to gauge the success

191
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,995
of proposed sketches, and they greatly influence

192
00:09:10,035 --> 00:09:12,417
how and why I arrive at my final compositions.

193
00:09:12,497 --> 00:09:13,678
So, here they are.

194
00:09:14,198 --> 00:09:16,359
First off, the primary purpose of the key art

195
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:19,522
is to generate player excitement for new content updates.

196
00:09:19,982 --> 00:09:22,283
And of course, we want to attract players

197
00:09:22,303 --> 00:09:24,185
that would be interested in playing the type of game

198
00:09:24,205 --> 00:09:27,187
we're actually made, so it's important that the key art

199
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:30,029
help establish expectations for the specific

200
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:31,430
gameplay experience we're offering.

201
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:34,202
ESO is not a horror game or a comedy,

202
00:09:34,342 --> 00:09:36,363
it's a social dungeon questing RPG,

203
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:39,104
and the key art needs to convey a tone of adventure

204
00:09:39,184 --> 00:09:40,664
and meaningful character interaction

205
00:09:40,684 --> 00:09:43,025
that's representative of what players will experience

206
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:43,706
when they log in.

207
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:46,727
And of course, the key art needs to highlight

208
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:48,568
the new features and setting of the content update

209
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:49,348
that it accompanies.

210
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:51,169
This seems obvious,

211
00:09:51,229 --> 00:09:53,029
but it does have more detailed implications,

212
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:54,810
like decisions to clothe the characters

213
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,471
in newly created armor and outfits

214
00:09:56,571 --> 00:09:59,172
to reflect the gear that players will be able to collect

215
00:09:59,232 --> 00:10:00,232
in the accompanying update.

216
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,666
ESO is also extremely story driven,

217
00:10:03,706 --> 00:10:05,127
and the key art needs to reflect that

218
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:06,887
by being focused on narrative as well.

219
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,988
Now this is a major point of emphasis for my art director.

220
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:12,789
He's always pushing me to inject as much narrative

221
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:14,210
as possible into the key art,

222
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,551
and as we'll see, that heavily influences

223
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:18,311
the content of the compositions that I develop.

224
00:10:20,572 --> 00:10:22,333
And then finally, another important requirement

225
00:10:22,393 --> 00:10:23,473
is that our key art feature

226
00:10:23,593 --> 00:10:25,434
emotionally resonant player characters.

227
00:10:25,914 --> 00:10:27,975
Emphasis on the player character part.

228
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,436
Bethesda's marketing department insists

229
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:32,498
that the key art for ESO include figures

230
00:10:32,518 --> 00:10:34,579
that the player can imagine themselves inhabiting

231
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,381
based on the type of experiences

232
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:37,722
offered to them by the gameplay.

233
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:39,203
That means that I can't just depict

234
00:10:39,303 --> 00:10:41,525
off-screen story moments occurring between NPCs.

235
00:10:42,146 --> 00:10:43,206
A figure representing the player

236
00:10:43,246 --> 00:10:44,848
must always be involved in the action

237
00:10:44,928 --> 00:10:47,890
and that demand introduces a whole host of complications

238
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,171
that require creative solutions.

239
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:51,773
And we'll be talking about that more in just a minute.

240
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:56,757
Now, with all that in mind,

241
00:10:57,471 --> 00:10:59,251
You can see how planning one of these illustrations

242
00:10:59,371 --> 00:11:00,772
is an exercise in problem solving.

243
00:11:01,752 --> 00:11:03,352
Luckily, the demands that I'm talking about

244
00:11:03,452 --> 00:11:05,213
rarely contradict one another outright.

245
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:07,773
However, they rarely all serve in the best interest

246
00:11:07,853 --> 00:11:09,313
of achieving an elegant composition,

247
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:10,834
which is my primary concern.

248
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:14,074
So the struggle for me becomes finding my way

249
00:11:14,114 --> 00:11:16,055
to an aesthetically competent visual solution

250
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,435
while also accommodating external requests

251
00:11:18,455 --> 00:11:20,496
that severely handicap my ability to do that.

252
00:11:21,456 --> 00:11:22,836
And to demonstrate how this works in practice,

253
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:24,157
what I want to do now is highlight

254
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,257
three specific challenges that I come up against

255
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:26,957
pretty frequently.

256
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:30,623
and which have a significant impact on how these illustrations tend to turn out.

257
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:34,745
And to make it easier to distinguish between them, I've given them each a catchy name.

258
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:38,547
So we have the Mandate, the Black Ball, and the Chimera.

259
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:42,669
I'm going to explain each of these one by one and show examples of how they impact my work.

260
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:49,312
So we'll talk about the Mandate first, and it's basically my shorthand to refer to that last parameter I mentioned earlier,

261
00:11:49,632 --> 00:11:53,354
where I'm required to include player characters in every key art illustration that I produce.

262
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:56,889
This tends to be extremely problematic,

263
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:58,750
both compositionally and narratively,

264
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,391
because if you're going to put an extra character in a scene,

265
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:03,773
that character needs to have a reason to be there.

266
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,574
He has to have an important role

267
00:12:05,614 --> 00:12:06,835
because we don't want to give the impression

268
00:12:06,855 --> 00:12:09,196
that our players are essentially spectators to the action.

269
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:12,878
Additionally, player characters are deliberately conceived

270
00:12:12,938 --> 00:12:14,879
of as blank canvases onto which players

271
00:12:14,899 --> 00:12:16,120
can imprint their own stories.

272
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,642
So there's nothing specifically unique

273
00:12:18,742 --> 00:12:21,083
about raw player characters' identities or backstories

274
00:12:21,383 --> 00:12:22,944
that enables viewers to engage with them.

275
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:24,533
And that means that the relevance

276
00:12:24,553 --> 00:12:25,573
to the illustration's narrative

277
00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:27,374
has to be derived performatively.

278
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:29,516
That is, they have to be doing something.

279
00:12:31,497 --> 00:12:33,458
Unfortunately, as with any game type,

280
00:12:33,478 --> 00:12:35,059
there's a limit to the types of activities

281
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:37,400
players can actually participate in while playing an MMO,

282
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,001
some of which I've listed here.

283
00:12:39,021 --> 00:12:42,102
And we could depict scenes of players

284
00:12:42,142 --> 00:12:43,283
engaging in these activities,

285
00:12:43,323 --> 00:12:45,584
but that would violate some of the other items

286
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:47,125
on our list of goals and parameters, right?

287
00:12:47,844 --> 00:12:49,966
For instance, as a rule, available player activities

288
00:12:50,026 --> 00:12:51,468
remain the same for each update,

289
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:54,411
but key art is supposed to be focused on new content.

290
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,853
So I can't just do like a crafting illustration

291
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:58,835
or a fishing illustration and call it key art.

292
00:12:59,135 --> 00:13:00,637
There's nothing exciting about that.

293
00:13:01,678 --> 00:13:03,239
And in part, that's because those activities

294
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:05,241
don't lend themselves to a compelling narrative,

295
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:07,904
and our key art is supposed to be fundamentally focused

296
00:13:08,044 --> 00:13:09,425
on the main narrative of an update.

297
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:12,284
The activities that I listed on the last slide

298
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:13,785
may represent ways that the players

299
00:13:13,865 --> 00:13:15,465
experience new story content,

300
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:18,546
but they don't represent the unique appeal of that content,

301
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:20,846
and that's something that the key art is supposed to do.

302
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:23,827
Furthermore, the activity depicted in the key art

303
00:13:23,947 --> 00:13:25,747
can't be so specific to an individual quest

304
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:28,788
that it ignores the larger role-playing theme of the update.

305
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:31,788
Now, when new systems are introduced in an update,

306
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:33,128
things get a lot easier for me.

307
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:35,489
For example, when we launch a new guild

308
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:36,289
that players can join,

309
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:38,749
then we can specifically depict players engaging

310
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:40,290
in the activity defining that guild.

311
00:13:41,229 --> 00:13:44,170
So the Thieves Guild is obviously a fraternity of thieves,

312
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,390
and so the key art for our Thieves Guild update

313
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,111
could logically focus on player characters

314
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:48,891
committing a heist.

315
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:53,192
Likewise, the Dark Brotherhood is a group of assassins,

316
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:54,572
and so the key art for that update

317
00:13:54,672 --> 00:13:56,312
naturally depicted player characters

318
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:57,993
performing an assassination.

319
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:01,854
Similarly, our Morrowind expansion

320
00:14:02,054 --> 00:14:03,834
included the new Warden player class,

321
00:14:03,914 --> 00:14:05,314
so we had an obvious opportunity

322
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:06,535
to showcase player characters

323
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,195
utilizing the new class's skill line.

324
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:09,595
And then finally,

325
00:14:10,437 --> 00:14:13,220
Our Homestead update introduced a new player housing system,

326
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,543
so an ideal solution was to show player characters

327
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:16,684
inhabiting a private home.

328
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:22,331
These pieces fulfilled the new content

329
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:25,294
and main narrative parameters because they each more or less

330
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:27,737
represented the marketing focus of the update,

331
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:30,260
and because they established a new role-playing concept

332
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:30,961
for us to highlight.

333
00:14:31,564 --> 00:14:32,985
But without a new system to feature,

334
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:34,526
the marketing push typically focuses

335
00:14:34,686 --> 00:14:37,528
on a new playable zone or dungeon or a story-based theme,

336
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:40,210
and finding ways to meaningfully include player characters

337
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,972
in those becomes a real challenge.

338
00:14:43,973 --> 00:14:45,934
In these cases, I have to ask myself the question,

339
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:48,456
what's the difference between a player character

340
00:14:48,716 --> 00:14:50,478
and an NPC, visually speaking?

341
00:14:51,398 --> 00:14:53,740
It's a question that doesn't really have a specific answer.

342
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,883
For example, one of the two compositions you see here

343
00:14:57,903 --> 00:15:00,084
was rejected for a lack of player characters in it.

344
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:01,285
Which one is it?

345
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:03,630
Let's go for some audience participation here.

346
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:05,912
I know these are just unfinished line drawings,

347
00:15:05,932 --> 00:15:07,653
but raise your hand if you think the one on the left

348
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,134
failed to include player characters.

349
00:15:10,975 --> 00:15:12,416
Okay, and then raise your hand if you think

350
00:15:12,456 --> 00:15:13,197
it was the one on the right.

351
00:15:15,138 --> 00:15:19,281
All right, so people who chose the left were correct,

352
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:21,322
but I'm not surprised that the room is torn.

353
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:24,264
It's an unfair question, because oftentimes

354
00:15:24,305 --> 00:15:26,466
the player character designation is only clear

355
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:28,988
if you already understand the backstory of the quest design.

356
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,490
And that's information that most consumers won't have

357
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,751
when they first see the image anyway.

358
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,474
In short, there is no significant visual distinction

359
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:38,215
between a player character and an NPC,

360
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:39,496
which is kind of the point.

361
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:41,758
So what's the executive team's way

362
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:43,679
of identifying player characters in these sketches?

363
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,082
Well, in my experience, they seem to recognize

364
00:15:47,102 --> 00:15:48,363
player characters in key art

365
00:15:48,423 --> 00:15:50,004
according to the following parameters.

366
00:15:50,404 --> 00:15:52,225
They're looking for a cluster of three figures

367
00:15:52,806 --> 00:15:55,027
of different races, who are typically foreigners

368
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,189
to the location of the new content.

369
00:15:58,048 --> 00:16:00,510
and preferably outfitted with gear indicative

370
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,591
of different player classes.

371
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,653
Now, these parameters have never been

372
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:04,754
explicitly defined for me.

373
00:16:04,794 --> 00:16:06,215
This is just what I've gleaned over time

374
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:08,296
based on which of my compositions have been rejected

375
00:16:08,757 --> 00:16:09,717
and which have been greenlighted.

376
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:13,500
But the hidden cost of having to accommodate

377
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,562
the player character mandate is that it forces me

378
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:17,964
to forsake a lot of great off-screen story moments

379
00:16:18,004 --> 00:16:19,285
because there's just no way to inject

380
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,286
player characters into them.

381
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,188
Okay, that is the mandate.

382
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:25,690
So now let's talk about the black ball,

383
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,291
which is basically the mandate's opposite.

384
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:35,234
So the black ball represents the kind of seemingly random blanket prohibitions that executive stakeholders sometimes place on certain compositional elements.

385
00:16:36,255 --> 00:16:42,619
One of the more problematic of these is the directive that I can't show main characters that are turned away from the viewer.

386
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:50,766
Now that might not seem like a big deal at first, and it's certainly an understandable request given that heroic character backs have become something of a trope in marketing imagery.

387
00:16:51,726 --> 00:16:55,369
And admittedly, avoiding the overused example shown here is not a bad idea.

388
00:16:57,536 --> 00:17:03,259
But there are also many cases where it's compositionally and narratively useful to depict the main character facing away from the viewer.

389
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,242
And the reason for that has to do with the limitations of single-image visual narrative.

390
00:17:07,262 --> 00:17:09,243
We're going to get deep here, okay.

391
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:16,247
Fundamentally, the spatial link between a figure's face and the object of their attention results in two parallel image planes that face one another.

392
00:17:17,248 --> 00:17:22,511
And it's generally impossible to see the fronts of two surfaces at the same time when they're facing in opposite directions.

393
00:17:24,072 --> 00:17:24,952
Cinema deals with this.

394
00:17:25,564 --> 00:17:27,385
by cutting between multiple reverse shots.

395
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:29,505
So one shot shows the character's POV,

396
00:17:29,545 --> 00:17:31,626
while a second shot will show the character's reaction

397
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:32,606
to what we just saw.

398
00:17:33,407 --> 00:17:35,527
But in key art illustration, we don't have the luxury

399
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:37,628
of multiple POV shots, so oftentimes,

400
00:17:37,668 --> 00:17:39,829
we're forced to choose between focusing on the character

401
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:41,609
or focusing in what she's looking at.

402
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:43,310
And doing the latter typically means

403
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,290
we see the character's back instead of her face.

404
00:17:47,051 --> 00:17:48,211
Now, while focusing on the character

405
00:17:48,271 --> 00:17:49,452
is certainly the primary conduit

406
00:17:49,472 --> 00:17:50,852
for evoking emotion in the viewer,

407
00:17:51,532 --> 00:17:53,133
the character's object of interest

408
00:17:53,253 --> 00:17:54,913
is oftentimes more powerful.

409
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:57,320
in being narratively informative.

410
00:17:58,961 --> 00:17:59,421
Why is that?

411
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,824
Well, in its simplest form, you can think of narrative as the presentation of cause

412
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:04,304
and effect.

413
00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:09,267
So first, there is an inciting incident, and then drama emerges from the way the consequences

414
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:10,348
of that incident play out.

415
00:18:11,148 --> 00:18:16,672
For example, if an earthquake causes a tsunami, the predictable consequences of death and

416
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:17,833
destruction are likely to follow.

417
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,742
In character-centric illustration,

418
00:18:21,802 --> 00:18:23,343
whatever challenge the characters are shown

419
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:25,324
to be confronting is what occupies the role of cause,

420
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:28,627
and the character's reaction to it represents the effect.

421
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:32,730
As a rule, an effect is more easily inferred

422
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,932
than its cause, so it's easier for a viewer

423
00:18:34,952 --> 00:18:36,353
to guess at what a character's reaction

424
00:18:36,393 --> 00:18:37,975
to an incident will be than it is to guess

425
00:18:38,015 --> 00:18:39,636
at the situation that was responsible

426
00:18:39,656 --> 00:18:40,937
for producing that reaction.

427
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:43,099
The viewer needs to see evidence

428
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:45,120
of whatever situation a character is facing

429
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,902
in order to understand what's at stake

430
00:18:47,062 --> 00:18:49,604
and to sympathize with what they're experiencing.

431
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,372
So returning to our tsunami example,

432
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:53,753
if we want to plan an illustration

433
00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:56,155
that conveys the essence of the rudimentary narrative

434
00:18:56,175 --> 00:18:56,756
we've set up here,

435
00:18:57,156 --> 00:18:59,478
and we can only focus on one of these story beads,

436
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:02,081
which image should we keep in order to retain

437
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:03,622
as much of the story as possible?

438
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:06,905
I would argue that the first image is more useful.

439
00:19:08,186 --> 00:19:09,888
Consider if we were to take that first image away

440
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:12,190
and only see an image of death and destruction,

441
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,612
well, there are any number of situations

442
00:19:14,652 --> 00:19:15,653
that may have led to that result.

443
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:20,700
including a tornado, a fire, or some kind of military action.

444
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,341
But if we keep only the inciting incident,

445
00:19:25,202 --> 00:19:27,063
well, its resulting consequences are usually

446
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:27,963
much more predictable.

447
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:31,085
Conversely, an illustration that only

448
00:19:31,165 --> 00:19:33,426
focuses on a character's reaction to a conflict

449
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:36,367
without showing what that conflict is, well,

450
00:19:36,387 --> 00:19:38,828
that robs us of some very powerful storytelling tools.

451
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:42,250
And since we want to show both the cause and its effect

452
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,550
within a single illustration.

453
00:19:43,894 --> 00:19:45,374
The problem with the black ball demand

454
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,555
is that it requires me to make two facing planes

455
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:49,175
visible to the viewer simultaneously

456
00:19:49,515 --> 00:19:50,436
from a single point of view.

457
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:52,596
The most straightforward way to do that

458
00:19:52,636 --> 00:19:54,077
is to view the scene side on,

459
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:56,437
but that forces the composition to be set up

460
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:58,358
like everything is occurring on a theater stage,

461
00:19:58,798 --> 00:19:59,578
which is pretty boring.

462
00:20:01,318 --> 00:20:02,959
Of course, it is possible to find other solutions

463
00:20:02,999 --> 00:20:04,639
to this restriction, but the black ball

464
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,520
still significantly limits the types of images

465
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,260
and stories that I can effectively tackle in ESO key art.

466
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,101
Okay, so that's the black ball.

467
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:14,756
And just to review, the mandate forces extra elements

468
00:20:14,856 --> 00:20:17,238
into the key art, while the black ball restricts

469
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:19,039
the options I have at my disposal

470
00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:20,480
to incorporate them gracefully.

471
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,741
And collectively, they limit my ability

472
00:20:22,781 --> 00:20:25,743
to generate clear, concise compositions for new key art,

473
00:20:25,783 --> 00:20:28,084
which in turn leads to the third major challenge,

474
00:20:28,785 --> 00:20:31,826
which is the chimera, expanding the scope of a composition

475
00:20:31,886 --> 00:20:33,487
to accommodate disparate marketing goals.

476
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:34,808
This one's the killer.

477
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:37,230
The chimera basically refers to efforts

478
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,051
to shoehorn extra compositional elements,

479
00:20:39,391 --> 00:20:40,352
such as player characters.

480
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:42,667
into a narrative that wasn't designed to fit them.

481
00:20:43,627 --> 00:20:45,148
More often than not, this comes about

482
00:20:45,188 --> 00:20:47,209
when stakeholders propose their own solutions

483
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:49,371
to the problems created by the two preceding challenges,

484
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:51,552
and it's by far the biggest source of scope creep

485
00:20:51,612 --> 00:20:52,672
I encounter with the key art.

486
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:56,174
So as an example, let's take a look at the set of comps

487
00:20:56,194 --> 00:20:58,976
that I developed for our 2017 third quarter update,

488
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:00,336
the Horns of the Reach.

489
00:21:01,337 --> 00:21:02,798
And each comp you see here depicts

490
00:21:02,918 --> 00:21:04,919
an off-screen story moment extrapolated

491
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:06,420
from the content of the main quest.

492
00:21:07,151 --> 00:21:09,153
Now, while I knowingly omitted player characters

493
00:21:09,313 --> 00:21:10,434
from the top two sketches,

494
00:21:10,794 --> 00:21:13,036
the bottom two were conceived to allow for certain figures

495
00:21:13,076 --> 00:21:15,958
to be interpretable as either player characters or NPCs.

496
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,762
In spite of that, the executive team preferred this sketch

497
00:21:19,782 --> 00:21:20,502
from the top row.

498
00:21:21,123 --> 00:21:22,844
But since it didn't include player characters,

499
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,306
they requested that I modify the composition to add them in.

500
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:27,909
Now, that was problematic because the ritual

501
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:29,830
that I'm showing take place here doesn't allow.

502
00:21:30,382 --> 00:21:32,402
for the player to have any active role in the scene.

503
00:21:32,863 --> 00:21:34,263
Players don't actually participate in

504
00:21:34,463 --> 00:21:36,024
or witness this ritual in game,

505
00:21:36,224 --> 00:21:37,484
it's only mentioned by NPCs,

506
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:39,645
and player characters just wouldn't make sense

507
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:40,886
within the context of the story

508
00:21:40,906 --> 00:21:42,566
that this composition was intended to tell.

509
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:46,428
But due to production time constraints,

510
00:21:46,468 --> 00:21:47,548
and because the stakeholders

511
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:49,289
had already endorsed this composition,

512
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:51,149
I had to find a way to fit player characters

513
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:51,970
in there somehow.

514
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,011
And my art director's solution was to expand the image.

515
00:21:55,387 --> 00:21:59,510
by framing this composition with player characters sneaking up on the ritual in order to stop

516
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:00,490
it from being performed.

517
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:04,853
So that caused the scope of the illustration to expand immensely.

518
00:22:07,094 --> 00:22:11,596
It also created this strange image within an image effect where the foreground scene

519
00:22:11,616 --> 00:22:17,019
of the player characters framing the action that's taking place in the background makes

520
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:19,661
the original scene seem even more vignetted and remote.

521
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:24,828
Not to mention, it more than doubled the total surface area

522
00:22:24,848 --> 00:22:27,769
that I had to render and resulted in a lot of after hours

523
00:22:27,829 --> 00:22:29,490
and weekend work to get this thing completed

524
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,210
before the deadline.

525
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,432
And the real kicker was that for the final ad campaign,

526
00:22:36,372 --> 00:22:38,173
somebody decided to crop the image back down

527
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:39,593
to my original composition anyway

528
00:22:40,034 --> 00:22:42,454
for most social media posts, so we are not a fan of that.

529
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:43,355
Get that out of there.

530
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:47,336
There are two relevant takeaways from this example.

531
00:22:47,836 --> 00:22:50,577
The first is that adding characters

532
00:22:50,597 --> 00:22:52,078
dramatically increases production time.

533
00:22:52,867 --> 00:22:56,048
While my producer tries to accommodate me when the scope of an illustration changes,

534
00:22:56,369 --> 00:23:00,371
oftentimes the additional work required exceeds the additional time available for me to complete it.

535
00:23:01,071 --> 00:23:03,252
So it's in my personal interest to avoid character bloat.

536
00:23:03,692 --> 00:23:07,535
But more importantly, showing more oftentimes doesn't make the composition better.

537
00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:12,177
In fact, it may overcrowd the image, complicate the read, and make the picture feel too busy.

538
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:16,346
Now the image within an image framing device

539
00:23:16,386 --> 00:23:18,627
that ended up being used in that last example

540
00:23:18,707 --> 00:23:20,969
is worth a little more discussion before we move on

541
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:23,650
because it's an idea that gets suggested semi-frequently

542
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,833
as a way to stretch a single illustration on ESO

543
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:29,154
to include more complex plot elements

544
00:23:29,194 --> 00:23:30,215
than it can comfortably hold.

545
00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:32,976
And to show what I mean, let's take a look

546
00:23:33,017 --> 00:23:35,178
at the selected sketch for the Cigic Order key art

547
00:23:35,198 --> 00:23:37,179
that I painted for ESO's Summer Set update

548
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,481
where we can see all three challenges at play.

549
00:23:39,781 --> 00:23:41,862
So first, the chimera issue is represented

550
00:23:42,209 --> 00:23:44,070
by the picture-in-picture effect created

551
00:23:44,211 --> 00:23:47,953
by imagery appearing inside a magical holographic vision

552
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:49,114
at the top of the sketch here.

553
00:23:50,675 --> 00:23:52,376
And that's because in the corresponding content,

554
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,478
the mages of the Psijagoda were spatially removed

555
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,239
from the events of the main quest line,

556
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:58,280
so I was asked to include this floating,

557
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,262
magical snow globe element as a way

558
00:24:00,282 --> 00:24:02,723
of symbolically representing the threat

559
00:24:02,743 --> 00:24:04,305
that the players would face in the main story.

560
00:24:05,786 --> 00:24:07,167
Also, the mandate came into play

561
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:08,928
because my original drawing didn't explicitly

562
00:24:08,968 --> 00:24:09,888
include player characters.

563
00:24:10,228 --> 00:24:12,369
So my art director requested that I restructure

564
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:15,111
the composition to fit a trio of player characters

565
00:24:15,132 --> 00:24:16,593
into a horizontal crop format.

566
00:24:17,153 --> 00:24:18,974
And finally, the black ball restricted the options

567
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:20,716
available to me to make those changes

568
00:24:20,976 --> 00:24:22,557
because I couldn't position foreground characters

569
00:24:22,577 --> 00:24:23,858
with their backs turned toward the viewer.

570
00:24:25,579 --> 00:24:28,261
So adding the triad of player characters

571
00:24:28,321 --> 00:24:30,623
created a very unbalanced image composition,

572
00:24:30,663 --> 00:24:32,404
so I was able to successfully argue

573
00:24:32,424 --> 00:24:34,126
to get one of those player characters removed.

574
00:24:36,287 --> 00:24:37,628
And the final composition ended up

575
00:24:37,668 --> 00:24:38,789
being reasonably effective.

576
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:42,507
with the exception of the picture-in-picture motif represented in the center.

577
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:47,088
It's difficult to parse exactly what it is that we're seeing inside that magical sphere,

578
00:24:47,228 --> 00:24:51,770
and the fact that its meaning can only be understood symbolically doesn't do the narrative

579
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:52,350
any favors.

580
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:56,932
It was a struggle for me to even get the illustration to this level of readability,

581
00:24:57,032 --> 00:25:02,074
and since then I've used it as a cautionary example to dissuade similar suggestions

582
00:25:02,494 --> 00:25:04,275
from more image-within-an-image compositions.

583
00:25:10,171 --> 00:25:12,712
So, now that we've covered the major challenges

584
00:25:13,592 --> 00:25:15,873
that limit my options when conceptualizing the key art,

585
00:25:16,613 --> 00:25:18,493
I wanna show some of the tools that I rely on

586
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:20,754
to maximize the narrative impact of an illustration

587
00:25:20,794 --> 00:25:22,394
without overloading and breaking it.

588
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,235
And as a case study, I'm going to walk,

589
00:25:25,335 --> 00:25:27,316
to briefly walk through the development process

590
00:25:27,356 --> 00:25:30,276
of the key art I created for ESO's Dragon Bones update,

591
00:25:30,957 --> 00:25:32,257
which I painted back in December of 2017,

592
00:25:32,617 --> 00:25:35,038
and which was released the following March.

593
00:25:35,572 --> 00:25:37,553
And as we'll see, most of the creative work for the key art

594
00:25:37,593 --> 00:25:39,133
is front loaded to the earlier stages,

595
00:25:39,553 --> 00:25:41,434
while the actual production and rendering of the image

596
00:25:41,454 --> 00:25:42,994
is a rather mechanical exercise.

597
00:25:44,594 --> 00:25:46,775
So the whole process starts with an initial brief

598
00:25:46,815 --> 00:25:48,975
from my art director, which essentially amounts

599
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:51,096
to a really basic overview of the new content,

600
00:25:51,156 --> 00:25:53,336
along with his ideas for particular story moments,

601
00:25:53,836 --> 00:25:55,457
or important visual elements that he thinks

602
00:25:55,497 --> 00:25:56,577
we should highlight in the key art.

603
00:25:57,497 --> 00:25:59,718
As I mentioned, one of the things my art director

604
00:25:59,778 --> 00:26:01,818
really likes to emphasize is a narrative focus

605
00:26:01,838 --> 00:26:02,938
for each illustration we do.

606
00:26:03,571 --> 00:26:06,631
It's important to him that each image tells its own story.

607
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,492
Now the Dragon Bones update was a dungeon pack,

608
00:26:09,592 --> 00:26:11,512
which in the cadence of the ESO release schedule

609
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:13,593
tends to mean that it's relatively thin on story.

610
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:17,353
But the basic gist of it was that a necromancer

611
00:26:17,393 --> 00:26:19,114
had discovered the bones of an ancient dragon,

612
00:26:19,754 --> 00:26:20,994
which he intended to reanimate

613
00:26:21,894 --> 00:26:23,154
and use it to kill all of his enemies.

614
00:26:23,814 --> 00:26:25,595
The player's goal is to stop him,

615
00:26:26,155 --> 00:26:27,755
and in doing so, collect cool loot.

616
00:26:28,775 --> 00:26:31,456
So maybe not super original when viewed at a high level,

617
00:26:31,496 --> 00:26:33,036
but it's definitely enough to get us started.

618
00:26:34,351 --> 00:26:35,652
So after talking with my art director,

619
00:26:35,672 --> 00:26:36,873
I do some more research on my own,

620
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:39,054
which includes reading the design documents

621
00:26:39,094 --> 00:26:40,535
generated by the content designers,

622
00:26:41,496 --> 00:26:42,637
looking through the concept art

623
00:26:42,657 --> 00:26:43,657
that's been done for the update,

624
00:26:44,098 --> 00:26:45,819
and depending on whether it's been built yet,

625
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:47,560
I fly through the play space to get a feel

626
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,801
for the environments the players

627
00:26:48,821 --> 00:26:49,862
will encounter while playing.

628
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,485
So what do those story elements that I mentioned

629
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:55,726
determine for the key art?

630
00:26:56,266 --> 00:26:58,027
Well, right away, I knew that this key art

631
00:26:58,068 --> 00:26:59,709
was obviously going to have to showcase

632
00:26:59,729 --> 00:27:01,130
a reanimated dragon skeleton.

633
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:03,669
It was the central focus of the dungeon pack,

634
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:05,370
and you can't call something dragon bones

635
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,351
and then ignore those bones in the marketing campaign.

636
00:27:08,532 --> 00:27:10,453
Also, since it's unusual, even in Tamriel,

637
00:27:10,473 --> 00:27:11,954
for a dragon's bones to come back to life,

638
00:27:12,134 --> 00:27:13,774
I knew that it would be important to show

639
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:15,635
the player character's shock and surprise

640
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,676
at encountering a giant living skeleton.

641
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:20,638
I also needed to provide some explanation

642
00:27:20,698 --> 00:27:23,639
of how or why the dragon's skeleton has become reanimated,

643
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:25,820
which meant I needed to create a visual link

644
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,861
between the necromancer and the dragon

645
00:27:28,182 --> 00:27:29,302
so that the viewer understands

646
00:27:29,342 --> 00:27:30,563
the causal connection between them.

647
00:27:31,638 --> 00:27:33,419
And then finally, in order to convey the enormity

648
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:35,200
of the threat the dragon poses to our heroes,

649
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,441
it would be helpful to emphasize the scale of the dragon

650
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:39,241
compared to the size of the human characters.

651
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,163
So with those cues as a jumping off point,

652
00:27:43,223 --> 00:27:45,224
I started doing some very rough thumbnail sketches,

653
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:47,565
and you can see how these are all really built

654
00:27:47,705 --> 00:27:49,085
on the elements that I just talked about,

655
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:51,106
especially the scale difference

656
00:27:51,126 --> 00:27:52,447
between the necromancer and the dragon

657
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:54,327
and the player character's reaction to seeing it.

658
00:27:55,388 --> 00:27:57,088
The sketch in the lower left-hand corner

659
00:27:57,128 --> 00:27:58,169
had the most developed narratives,

660
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:00,450
so I started fleshing that one out first.

661
00:28:03,341 --> 00:28:06,083
As we discussed, a major storytelling constraint

662
00:28:06,123 --> 00:28:07,964
of key art illustration is that we're confined

663
00:28:07,984 --> 00:28:09,686
to telling our story within a single image.

664
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:12,848
And that makes it difficult to convey multiple story beats

665
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:14,189
that take place over time.

666
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,691
One of the ways that I sidestep that issue

667
00:28:16,731 --> 00:28:18,632
is by using different characters to represent

668
00:28:18,673 --> 00:28:20,214
different beats or moments in time.

669
00:28:21,455 --> 00:28:23,536
A successful reading of the image is therefore dependent

670
00:28:23,616 --> 00:28:26,138
upon constructing the composition so that the viewer's eye

671
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:28,260
notices each of these story beats in the order we want,

672
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,442
and we can see that playing out in this first comp here.

673
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:32,612
So the initial read in this composition

674
00:28:32,672 --> 00:28:35,033
is clearly the necromancer silhouetted

675
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:36,214
in front of the dragon's skeleton.

676
00:28:36,774 --> 00:28:38,374
And based on his pose, we get the sense

677
00:28:38,394 --> 00:28:40,595
that he seems to be casting some sort of spell on the bones.

678
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,757
Next, we notice the figure in the center foreground

679
00:28:43,777 --> 00:28:45,677
who appears to be sneaking up behind the necromancer

680
00:28:45,697 --> 00:28:46,478
with his sword drawn.

681
00:28:47,758 --> 00:28:49,159
Along with that figure, we also pick up

682
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:50,619
on the foreground figure on the left

683
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:52,520
who is urgently gesturing towards something

684
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,761
on the right side of the image.

685
00:28:54,121 --> 00:28:56,221
And that carries our eyes to the figure on the right

686
00:28:56,262 --> 00:28:58,402
who seems to be startled by a light glowing

687
00:28:58,422 --> 00:29:00,743
from the eye socket of the dragon's skull.

688
00:29:01,737 --> 00:29:05,120
We also realize that the central foreground figure seems unaware of the glowing eye lights,

689
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:09,423
suggesting that they've only recently begun glowing sometime after he took up his current position.

690
00:29:10,504 --> 00:29:14,006
Now, of course, when we first look at the image, our minds take all this in within a second or two,

691
00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:18,510
but the order that we notice this stuff influences our ability to easily grasp a story,

692
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,632
and learning how to direct a viewer's eyes to move through a composition

693
00:29:21,732 --> 00:29:24,314
is an important aspect of storytelling through illustration.

694
00:29:26,527 --> 00:29:29,328
The artist has a number of tools at their disposal for directing the viewer's gaze.

695
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:33,209
This isn't really the focus of today's discussion, so I'm not going to go into detail with these,

696
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:38,491
but by playing with the relationships between lightness, color, scale, and proximity to the viewer,

697
00:29:38,731 --> 00:29:42,212
the artist can establish lines of action along the edges of major shapes,

698
00:29:43,113 --> 00:29:45,413
which is what guides the viewer's eyes through the composition.

699
00:29:46,274 --> 00:29:49,555
And there's one other important composition and planning tool that I think frequently gets overlooked,

700
00:29:49,635 --> 00:29:50,375
and that is that

701
00:29:50,904 --> 00:29:52,645
In the West, we're taught from an early age

702
00:29:52,685 --> 00:29:55,287
to process visual data by reading from top to bottom

703
00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:55,967
and left to right.

704
00:29:56,408 --> 00:29:58,009
That means that when a viewer approaches a work of art

705
00:29:58,029 --> 00:30:00,631
for the first time, their eyes will automatically seek

706
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:02,773
to enter the image from the upper left corner by default.

707
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:05,335
So it's important to take this into account

708
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,796
when planning for viewer eye movement

709
00:30:06,836 --> 00:30:08,677
because it gives you a reliable start point

710
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:10,899
where the viewer will enter the maze of your illustration.

711
00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:13,021
And just as importantly, if your goal is to have

712
00:30:13,041 --> 00:30:14,902
the viewer's eye first enter the image

713
00:30:14,922 --> 00:30:17,084
at a different location, then you have to build in

714
00:30:17,104 --> 00:30:18,845
a lot of extra visual cues to counteract

715
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:20,266
that top left corner bias.

716
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:30,264
So with that in mind, when we refer back to our dragon bone sketch, we see that I'm using the dragon's upper arm bone like a highway to lead the eye in from the upper left directly into the center of the image.

717
00:30:30,845 --> 00:30:36,668
From there, our eyes will continue to move around the composition following lines of action created by other major shapes.

718
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:46,895
Our eyes naturally stop to rest at any location where one line of action ends and another begins, and these areas thus become the focal points of the image and the location of different story beats.

719
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:49,297
So after taking in the necromancer,

720
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:54,263
The bright high contrast line created by the dragon's nose channels our eyes down to the character in front,

721
00:30:54,844 --> 00:31:00,669
where the angle of the sword and the direction of his body, his face, swings our focus back to the left,

722
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:02,871
encouraging us to engage with the figure position there.

723
00:31:03,891 --> 00:31:08,295
Next, our eyes pick back up on the high contrast edge created by the rim lighting of the dragon's forearm,

724
00:31:09,116 --> 00:31:11,918
and continues from left to right along the upper arm and spinal column.

725
00:31:12,752 --> 00:31:15,132
Now arcing our focus over the top of the image like this

726
00:31:15,192 --> 00:31:17,033
is an important step, but you could also say

727
00:31:17,073 --> 00:31:19,133
it's a dangerous one, insofar as there's any danger

728
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:21,674
in illustration, because in tracking along

729
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:24,015
the strong rightward descending shape of the dragon's spine,

730
00:31:24,095 --> 00:31:25,995
I'm reinforcing our eye's predisposition

731
00:31:26,015 --> 00:31:27,736
to move from left to right, and the risk

732
00:31:28,316 --> 00:31:29,456
is that the viewer's attention could drop

733
00:31:29,516 --> 00:31:30,477
right off the edge of the image,

734
00:31:30,497 --> 00:31:31,937
which is obviously not what we want.

735
00:31:32,817 --> 00:31:34,638
So that's why it's important to build interesting shapes

736
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:36,799
like the dragon's horn and the rim lighting

737
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:38,599
along the figure's outstretched arm.

738
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,840
which provide a directional counterforce to bring our focus back toward the center of the image.

739
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:47,242
And at this point, we see that we've established a circuit of visual interest,

740
00:31:47,842 --> 00:31:51,123
which invites the viewer to retread the moments of the story in a clockwise fashion,

741
00:31:51,223 --> 00:31:54,644
and in so doing, encourages them to spend longer engaging with the artwork.

742
00:31:55,764 --> 00:31:57,985
And when you spend as much time painting these images as I do,

743
00:31:58,025 --> 00:32:01,126
you definitely want to squeeze every second of your engagement that you can out of them.

744
00:32:03,285 --> 00:32:06,327
So not to belabor the point, but quickly going back through that narrative sequentially,

745
00:32:06,347 --> 00:32:09,770
this is the full story that we'd be trying to tell if we had more than one image available

746
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:10,450
to do it.

747
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:14,293
The necromancer begins casting a spell on the bones, our heroes sneak into position

748
00:32:14,333 --> 00:32:18,997
near the skull, the dragon's eyes light up, some of the heroes notice the eye lights and

749
00:32:19,057 --> 00:32:22,960
react, and then finally the dragon wakes up and our heroes become overmatched.

750
00:32:23,596 --> 00:32:25,757
Unfortunately, we only have one image at our disposal

751
00:32:25,797 --> 00:32:27,578
to tell this story, and technically,

752
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:29,980
this snapshot has to occur at a single moment in time.

753
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,121
So I'd say that what we're seeing in this comp

754
00:32:33,181 --> 00:32:34,862
is taking place right about here,

755
00:32:35,303 --> 00:32:36,663
somewhere between beats three and four.

756
00:32:36,964 --> 00:32:38,344
But of course, the first four beats

757
00:32:38,384 --> 00:32:40,225
are all represented to some extent in the comp,

758
00:32:40,366 --> 00:32:42,207
even though some have already occurred.

759
00:32:43,387 --> 00:32:45,488
Because the story beat of the glowing eye lights

760
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,349
is the last stop on the viewer's guided tour

761
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,491
through the composition, our eyes interpret it

762
00:32:49,531 --> 00:32:50,912
as having occurred more recently.

763
00:32:51,315 --> 00:32:52,276
than the other beats in the image,

764
00:32:52,396 --> 00:32:53,776
even though everything is ostensibly occurring

765
00:32:53,796 --> 00:32:54,797
at the same moment in time.

766
00:32:55,397 --> 00:32:57,198
But based on the way I've structured the composition,

767
00:32:57,258 --> 00:32:59,359
I'm providing clues to what has happened in the scene

768
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:00,819
just before the moment we're witnessing,

769
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,621
and giving the viewer hints of what is likely to happen

770
00:33:03,761 --> 00:33:04,721
in the moments to follow.

771
00:33:05,081 --> 00:33:06,882
So in this case, the dragon is going to wake up,

772
00:33:06,982 --> 00:33:08,183
and these guys are gonna be in trouble.

773
00:33:09,983 --> 00:33:11,404
In this way, I'm establishing a story

774
00:33:11,444 --> 00:33:12,885
with a beginning, a middle, and an end,

775
00:33:13,165 --> 00:33:14,405
all within just one image.

776
00:33:16,466 --> 00:33:18,247
Now, the feedback that I got from my art director

777
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:18,887
on this sketch,

778
00:33:19,517 --> 00:33:21,417
was that he wanted the player character to have more to do

779
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,798
than just sneak up on the bad guy.

780
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:24,799
And this is yet another example of the problem

781
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:26,360
created by the player character mandate.

782
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,021
Searching for solutions to that problem

783
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,281
led me to this composition here,

784
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:31,722
which shows our quest party attempting

785
00:33:31,762 --> 00:33:33,083
to steal loot from a dungeon.

786
00:33:34,563 --> 00:33:36,264
Obviously the dragon is the first major read here,

787
00:33:36,284 --> 00:33:37,785
but the critical element of this story

788
00:33:37,845 --> 00:33:39,765
is our hero's ignorance of the danger they're in.

789
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:42,227
So like this guy is so focused on breaking into the vault

790
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:44,347
that he's oblivious to the massive reanimated skull

791
00:33:44,387 --> 00:33:45,168
positioned right above him.

792
00:33:46,157 --> 00:33:48,177
The lookout on the right thinks he might have heard something,

793
00:33:48,197 --> 00:33:49,438
but he's looking in the wrong direction,

794
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:52,278
while the coiled posture of the figure holding the pickaxe

795
00:33:52,438 --> 00:33:54,979
tells us that he's just clued into the real danger from above.

796
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:57,800
And then over on the left, we have a confrontation going down

797
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,660
between one of our heroes and the necromancer

798
00:33:59,901 --> 00:34:01,101
who's being held at sword point.

799
00:34:01,601 --> 00:34:04,462
It's clear that our questing party believe they have the situation under control,

800
00:34:04,502 --> 00:34:06,282
but the necromancer's glowing staff

801
00:34:06,482 --> 00:34:09,643
indicates that he's magically controlling the as-yet-unnoticed dragon,

802
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,164
so he's not as helpless as he looks.

803
00:34:13,111 --> 00:34:15,593
storytelling problem with this composition is that the necromancer isn't

804
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:19,195
prominent enough in the image. Using the eye movement analysis we talked about

805
00:34:19,215 --> 00:34:22,337
before, the necromancer is one of the last reeds and the nature of the

806
00:34:22,377 --> 00:34:26,019
relationship between him and the dragon isn't very clear. So to try to solve that

807
00:34:26,059 --> 00:34:29,461
problem I kept the same stage but repositioned the actors to cede some

808
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:36,346
control back to the necromancer. So now he's the one in the position of power

809
00:34:36,586 --> 00:34:39,548
above our heroes and notice that the player characters each have different

810
00:34:39,568 --> 00:34:42,029
levels of awareness of the dangers facing them.

811
00:34:42,605 --> 00:34:45,027
So, like, the guy closest to the necromancer is still clueless,

812
00:34:45,587 --> 00:34:47,929
while two others are spotted with the spellcasting necromancer,

813
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:51,892
but the lookout in the foreground is the only one who's noticed the dragon might be waking up,

814
00:34:52,232 --> 00:34:54,554
which we're again indicating by the eye lights in the skull.

815
00:34:54,935 --> 00:34:58,477
And by using the same color for the light in the dragon's eyes and the necromancer's magic,

816
00:34:58,497 --> 00:35:01,620
we could really underscore the idea that the necromancer is the one in control here.

817
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:07,104
Now, as I mentioned, the narrative I'm constructing for each of these compositions

818
00:35:07,184 --> 00:35:10,767
involves at least some of the characters being unaware of the threat posed by the dragon.

819
00:35:11,297 --> 00:35:12,837
This is another technique that I lean on

820
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:13,918
to expand the narrative weight

821
00:35:13,938 --> 00:35:15,339
that can be carried by a single image.

822
00:35:15,979 --> 00:35:17,100
Because when the viewer knows something

823
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,801
that the characters don't, it creates a tension

824
00:35:20,101 --> 00:35:21,822
that anticipates the character's discovery

825
00:35:21,842 --> 00:35:23,463
of the information the viewer already has.

826
00:35:24,244 --> 00:35:26,505
And this allows me to indicate characteristic intentions

827
00:35:26,565 --> 00:35:28,766
and expectations prior to a watershed moment

828
00:35:29,046 --> 00:35:30,928
while simultaneously enabling the viewer

829
00:35:30,948 --> 00:35:33,329
to infer how the character's emotions will change

830
00:35:33,729 --> 00:35:35,510
in response to this moment of recognition.

831
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,071
So essentially what we're talking about

832
00:35:37,131 --> 00:35:39,192
is a plot reversal captured within a single image.

833
00:35:41,047 --> 00:35:42,988
So in this next composition, and this is the last one,

834
00:35:43,168 --> 00:35:45,589
I promise, I distilled that idea down even further.

835
00:35:45,669 --> 00:35:47,370
I got rid of the treasure hunter subplot

836
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,031
and replaced it with a direct confrontation

837
00:35:49,071 --> 00:35:51,092
between the Necromancer and our player characters

838
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,213
who seemingly had him cornered.

839
00:35:56,214 --> 00:35:57,974
But the Necromancer is smiling deviously

840
00:35:58,014 --> 00:35:59,015
in spite of his predicament

841
00:35:59,055 --> 00:36:01,356
because he knows he's about to get some major backup

842
00:36:01,416 --> 00:36:02,937
in the form of the fog-shrouded dragon

843
00:36:02,997 --> 00:36:04,057
he's summoning to protect him.

844
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:07,218
Like the other comps, this one includes

845
00:36:07,824 --> 00:36:10,225
one of the player characters depicted in the exact moment

846
00:36:10,265 --> 00:36:11,966
that they realize the dragon is awake.

847
00:36:12,407 --> 00:36:14,708
In this case, it's the figure furthest to the right.

848
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:20,052
So this is basically a pictorial form of anagnorisis,

849
00:36:20,152 --> 00:36:21,973
which refers to the moment in a story

850
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,794
when a character makes a critical discovery

851
00:36:24,174 --> 00:36:25,955
that changes the stakes emotionally.

852
00:36:31,019 --> 00:36:32,700
Including the story beat does two things.

853
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,201
First, it adds an immediacy to the danger.

854
00:36:35,706 --> 00:36:40,448
because clearly the guy on the right is about to alert his friends and everything is going to change.

855
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:44,610
And second, it also makes it clear that the dragon is indeed a threat.

856
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:49,092
Otherwise, it's possible that all these guys could just be ignoring the dragon for some reason,

857
00:36:49,313 --> 00:36:51,133
thereby undercutting his narrative significance.

858
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:55,736
Or perhaps the viewer could misinterpret the dragon as actually being allied with the player characters.

859
00:36:56,856 --> 00:37:02,399
The character experiencing anagnorisis tells us that his reaction is the same one that everybody else would be having

860
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:04,040
if only they saw what he was seeing.

861
00:37:04,948 --> 00:37:07,469
It's a useful tool for clarifying character intent

862
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:09,890
in complex compositions and expanding

863
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:10,990
the dramatic tension of a scene.

864
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,971
In any case, my art director liked this image,

865
00:37:13,991 --> 00:37:15,671
but he wanted it to have more story beats

866
00:37:16,011 --> 00:37:17,932
and to make it seem like our party of adventurers

867
00:37:18,072 --> 00:37:19,832
already had their hands full with other threats

868
00:37:19,892 --> 00:37:21,853
before the dragon even enters the ring.

869
00:37:22,193 --> 00:37:23,874
So basically, he wanted to raise the stakes.

870
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:27,715
So I added in some reanimated human skeletons

871
00:37:27,755 --> 00:37:29,015
for our adventurers to fight off,

872
00:37:29,035 --> 00:37:31,316
which also allowed me to promote the foreground figure

873
00:37:31,356 --> 00:37:32,856
on the left to our hero character.

874
00:37:33,515 --> 00:37:35,596
still poised to confront the necromancer directly

875
00:37:35,657 --> 00:37:37,618
while his buddies take out the skeletons behind him.

876
00:37:38,939 --> 00:37:40,761
And then finally, my art director felt that we needed

877
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:43,343
more indications of the location setting for this scene,

878
00:37:43,383 --> 00:37:45,505
so I added in some architectural pillars

879
00:37:45,545 --> 00:37:48,047
to imply that we were in a massive subterranean ruin.

880
00:37:49,668 --> 00:37:51,870
So, with four potential options at this point,

881
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,911
I did a color toning pass on each comp,

882
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:55,973
because while a composition may look great

883
00:37:55,993 --> 00:37:58,275
as a line drawing, when you introduce value and color,

884
00:37:58,595 --> 00:38:00,176
the readability and focal points of the image

885
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:00,917
can change greatly.

886
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,429
It's important to block all this stuff in early on

887
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:05,070
so that I can catch any major problems

888
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,012
before we invest too much time into a flawed composition.

889
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:11,895
At this stage, the color toning mostly breaks down

890
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:13,937
into warm and cool color influences

891
00:38:14,598 --> 00:38:16,259
meant to reinforce narrative cues

892
00:38:16,339 --> 00:38:18,400
like the relationship between the dragon

893
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,303
and the necromancer as indicated by the same cool glow

894
00:38:21,703 --> 00:38:22,564
to their magic effects.

895
00:38:23,845 --> 00:38:25,506
Nevertheless, everything at this stage

896
00:38:25,546 --> 00:38:26,447
is still just placeholder.

897
00:38:26,767 --> 00:38:28,568
And I typically end up redoing the line drawing,

898
00:38:28,588 --> 00:38:29,349
the gray-scale values,

899
00:38:29,842 --> 00:38:32,584
and the colors once a specific composition has been chosen.

900
00:38:34,606 --> 00:38:36,147
But once I complete the rough toning pass,

901
00:38:36,187 --> 00:38:37,828
my art director submits the options

902
00:38:37,868 --> 00:38:39,109
to the executive stakeholders,

903
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,571
and then the other executives reply with questions,

904
00:38:42,651 --> 00:38:44,872
comments, and concerns about various sketches,

905
00:38:45,353 --> 00:38:47,194
and their consensus opinion results

906
00:38:47,234 --> 00:38:48,735
in one of three possible verdicts.

907
00:38:49,676 --> 00:38:52,678
So first, they may reject all of the comps outright,

908
00:38:53,538 --> 00:38:55,960
in which case I need to determine what it is

909
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,201
about those options that I provided

910
00:38:58,221 --> 00:38:59,262
that's not working for them.

911
00:38:59,777 --> 00:39:01,318
so I can do a brand new round of sketches

912
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:02,919
that will hopefully be more successful.

913
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,381
And this iterative back and forth process

914
00:39:05,441 --> 00:39:09,284
can produce as many as three rounds of unique comps

915
00:39:09,385 --> 00:39:11,166
before one sketch is finally approved.

916
00:39:11,827 --> 00:39:13,728
And approval is the second possible outcome.

917
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,610
But more often than not, they deliver a third verdict,

918
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,152
which is a provisional approval.

919
00:39:18,652 --> 00:39:20,854
And basically this means that they like one of the comps,

920
00:39:21,274 --> 00:39:22,816
but they want me to make some changes to it

921
00:39:22,856 --> 00:39:24,797
before I start full on production.

922
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,521
So for the Dragon Bones key art we're looking at today,

923
00:39:28,581 --> 00:39:30,182
they did end up green lighting the last

924
00:39:30,222 --> 00:39:31,743
of the four compositions I developed,

925
00:39:31,763 --> 00:39:33,423
although that's not always the case.

926
00:39:35,204 --> 00:39:36,345
So even though we had the green light

927
00:39:36,365 --> 00:39:38,506
to go ahead with production on this composition,

928
00:39:38,546 --> 00:39:40,727
we still wanted to refine some image elements a bit

929
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:42,508
before I dove into detailed rendering work.

930
00:39:43,129 --> 00:39:45,470
One thing I wanted to do was introduce a warm light

931
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:47,571
into the scene to contrast the cool shafts

932
00:39:47,611 --> 00:39:49,192
of moonlight coming in from above.

933
00:39:50,893 --> 00:39:52,553
And so in order to justify that light source,

934
00:39:52,593 --> 00:39:54,835
I changed the pose of the figure on the far right.

935
00:39:55,363 --> 00:39:56,524
and put a torch in his hand.

936
00:39:57,925 --> 00:39:59,406
And even though it isn't represented here yet,

937
00:40:00,386 --> 00:40:03,228
we also decided to add flames scattered across the ground

938
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:04,830
between the Necromancer and the Front Warrior,

939
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,571
which would add a warm fill light

940
00:40:06,631 --> 00:40:09,253
to pop that Front Warrior off the cool background behind him

941
00:40:09,693 --> 00:40:11,634
and also create a symbolic separation

942
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:12,735
between the two characters.

943
00:40:14,977 --> 00:40:16,438
I also tried out a couple different poses

944
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:17,319
for the Necromancer,

945
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:20,181
and we ultimately settled on this one,

946
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:22,182
because by dropping his left arm like this,

947
00:40:22,542 --> 00:40:24,083
we create some additional space in the image

948
00:40:24,103 --> 00:40:24,964
for the dragon's head.

949
00:40:25,475 --> 00:40:27,057
which you want to establish as a focal point.

950
00:40:28,018 --> 00:40:30,260
And it also opens the space between the necromancer

951
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,662
and the front figure here, so we can imagine

952
00:40:32,702 --> 00:40:34,363
that their eyes are locked on one another,

953
00:40:34,443 --> 00:40:35,604
reinforcing the story beat

954
00:40:35,644 --> 00:40:36,965
of the confrontation between them.

955
00:40:38,126 --> 00:40:40,268
Now, you might have noticed that throughout

956
00:40:40,308 --> 00:40:41,810
this entire sketching process,

957
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:44,272
the figures I've been drawing are all semi-naked bald dudes.

958
00:40:44,312 --> 00:40:45,112
Has anybody noticed that?

959
00:40:46,614 --> 00:40:47,815
That's because in the early stages,

960
00:40:47,955 --> 00:40:49,736
it's simpler to sketch a generic human form.

961
00:40:50,187 --> 00:40:51,828
to indicate the position of shapes and volumes,

962
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:53,890
rather than allow myself to get caught up

963
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,611
in trying to capture specific details.

964
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:58,414
And it's also because even this early on in the painting,

965
00:40:58,454 --> 00:41:00,115
I'm using photo reference of myself

966
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:02,237
to inform the poses for the characters.

967
00:41:03,298 --> 00:41:04,659
And you can see some of those references here.

968
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,222
And there are a couple of benefits

969
00:41:07,242 --> 00:41:08,643
to using myself as a reference model.

970
00:41:09,265 --> 00:41:13,087
And the most important of these is that I have some idea of the mood that I want to convey in the pose,

971
00:41:13,587 --> 00:41:17,089
so I can kind of become that character myself without having to direct a model

972
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:20,430
who has no idea how their pose fits into the image or the story of the illustration.

973
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:27,314
But I think the main point here is that having adequate reference is absolutely essential to producing high-quality key art,

974
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:28,474
and I would argue any art.

975
00:41:29,575 --> 00:41:32,396
And I lean on reference heavily throughout the entire painting process.

976
00:41:33,397 --> 00:41:35,658
Any day that I find I'm really struggling with what I'm doing,

977
00:41:36,515 --> 00:41:37,996
I realize it's because I don't have good reference,

978
00:41:38,036 --> 00:41:40,357
and then I have to go search for it or create it myself,

979
00:41:40,897 --> 00:41:42,037
and then things get moving again.

980
00:41:44,438 --> 00:41:46,638
So although all the figures look vaguely like me

981
00:41:46,658 --> 00:41:48,619
at the beginning, we obviously want to represent

982
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:50,640
a more diverse cast of characters in the final painting.

983
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,841
There are nine playable character races

984
00:41:53,921 --> 00:41:56,561
and two genders in ESO, and at this stage,

985
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:58,522
we decide on race and gender assignments

986
00:41:58,582 --> 00:41:59,802
for each figure in the painting.

987
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:02,923
Of course, some of this is defined by the narrative.

988
00:42:03,663 --> 00:42:11,189
like if I'm depicting specific NPCs or if the scene is intended to take place in an area of Tamriel where a specific ethnicity is dominant in the population there.

989
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:17,073
We also want to represent at least one of the beast races since they're a signature part of the Elder Scrolls series.

990
00:42:17,774 --> 00:42:25,900
And in the interest of representation, when the narrative allows for it, I also try to represent a diversity of races from the real world as well as a mix of male and female characters.

991
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,003
More generally, I just want to say that...

992
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:34,422
I believe that as artists we have a responsibility to be sensitive to cultural representation

993
00:42:34,482 --> 00:42:38,923
in our work and be responsive to prevailing cultural climates, which in turn our work

994
00:42:38,963 --> 00:42:39,823
helps to influence.

995
00:42:40,584 --> 00:42:44,785
On the one hand, it's so weird to think that my paintings of a fantasy medieval society

996
00:42:44,805 --> 00:42:46,945
have any relevance to contemporary culture at all.

997
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:51,406
But the truth is, whether I intend it or not, every painting I produce makes a statement

998
00:42:51,446 --> 00:42:53,307
about how I personally view the world around me.

999
00:42:54,647 --> 00:42:58,468
And each painting also contributes to a cultivation of imagery that collectively shapes the way

1000
00:42:58,488 --> 00:42:59,428
our players view the world too.

1001
00:43:00,402 --> 00:43:01,502
And I'll give you just one example

1002
00:43:01,522 --> 00:43:03,383
of how this has been relevant in my own illustrations.

1003
00:43:04,944 --> 00:43:06,364
So the second piece that I worked on

1004
00:43:06,404 --> 00:43:09,046
after starting at ZOS was for ESO's Thieves Guild update.

1005
00:43:09,866 --> 00:43:11,927
The update takes place in the province of Hammerfell,

1006
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:14,468
which is the home of a primarily dark-skinned people

1007
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,329
called the Red Guards.

1008
00:43:16,149 --> 00:43:18,050
And it was therefore natural that characters

1009
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:20,031
with darker skin tones would feature prominently

1010
00:43:20,071 --> 00:43:20,631
in our key art.

1011
00:43:21,552 --> 00:43:22,872
But the composition that developed

1012
00:43:22,892 --> 00:43:25,233
during the sketching process depicted a lone member

1013
00:43:25,253 --> 00:43:26,974
of the Thieves Guild evading city guards

1014
00:43:27,014 --> 00:43:28,055
after pulling off a heist.

1015
00:43:29,152 --> 00:43:32,293
I was working on this illustration in the months following the Freddie Gray protests

1016
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:36,294
in Baltimore, and it occurred to me that it might not be the right cultural moment to

1017
00:43:36,334 --> 00:43:38,675
showcase a black man being chased by law enforcement.

1018
00:43:39,815 --> 00:43:43,436
On the other hand, however, populating the image with white characters in an in-game

1019
00:43:43,476 --> 00:43:47,757
location known to have a light-skinned minority seemed inescapably like marginalization.

1020
00:43:49,698 --> 00:43:53,038
So I voiced this concern, and I even sketched out some alternative racial treatments for

1021
00:43:53,058 --> 00:43:54,099
the primary character.

1022
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:57,640
But initially, the executive team was focused on establishing continuity.

1023
00:43:58,097 --> 00:43:59,638
with the main character that had been depicted

1024
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,539
in an earlier illustration for the same update.

1025
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:03,819
So I continued with production

1026
00:44:03,899 --> 00:44:05,440
with the character cast as a Redguard.

1027
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,101
And the image actually got fairly far into production

1028
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:09,482
before the decision was finally made

1029
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:11,803
to recast our hero thief as a Khajiit instead,

1030
00:44:12,323 --> 00:44:15,124
which is the version that was eventually released

1031
00:44:15,184 --> 00:44:15,784
to the public.

1032
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,345
Now, if we'd gone ahead with the original Redguard character

1033
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,686
we may never have been called on it.

1034
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:22,907
The connection might not have resonated

1035
00:44:22,927 --> 00:44:23,727
in the way that I feared.

1036
00:44:24,071 --> 00:44:25,972
But the point is that with every decision you make

1037
00:44:25,992 --> 00:44:27,693
in a painting, it has the potential to make

1038
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:29,233
a specific statement to your audience,

1039
00:44:29,594 --> 00:44:31,214
whether you intend that statement or not.

1040
00:44:31,815 --> 00:44:33,956
So the most responsible approach is to be deliberate

1041
00:44:33,996 --> 00:44:36,317
and circumspect with every choice you make in your art

1042
00:44:36,697 --> 00:44:39,418
in order to avoid inadvertently making statements

1043
00:44:39,878 --> 00:44:42,079
that you or your company might not intend.

1044
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,901
Anyway, getting back to the Dragon Bones key art,

1045
00:44:46,521 --> 00:44:49,683
once the race and gender selections are chosen

1046
00:44:49,723 --> 00:44:52,244
and approved, I start the line work stage of production.

1047
00:44:52,998 --> 00:44:55,440
where I go through each figure and modify the anatomy

1048
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,562
to match the body type of the race and gender

1049
00:44:57,682 --> 00:44:58,844
intended for each character.

1050
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:02,127
I also draw clothing, armor, and gear

1051
00:45:02,227 --> 00:45:03,648
on top of the anatomy drawings,

1052
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:06,131
and I tend to design the gear using inspiration

1053
00:45:06,151 --> 00:45:07,312
from in-game armor sets,

1054
00:45:07,932 --> 00:45:10,535
which I combine with influences from photo references

1055
00:45:10,655 --> 00:45:13,318
to inject more personality into the characters' outfits.

1056
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:15,720
And with the line work stage complete,

1057
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,862
it's finally time to start painting.

1058
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:23,032
So as I mentioned before, most of the creative work

1059
00:45:23,052 --> 00:45:24,192
for the key art is front loaded.

1060
00:45:24,652 --> 00:45:26,953
And honestly, by the time I'm done with the drawing stage,

1061
00:45:27,093 --> 00:45:28,474
most of the important creative decisions

1062
00:45:28,514 --> 00:45:29,675
have already been decided on.

1063
00:45:31,035 --> 00:45:34,177
My topic for today is not intended to focus on technique,

1064
00:45:34,217 --> 00:45:35,937
but in the interest of being thorough

1065
00:45:36,197 --> 00:45:38,298
and to give the session a satisfying conclusion,

1066
00:45:38,338 --> 00:45:39,579
I'd just like to quickly walk through

1067
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,080
the remaining stages of my process

1068
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,321
so we can see how this painting finished up.

1069
00:45:48,123 --> 00:45:49,223
Now after the line drawing,

1070
00:45:50,005 --> 00:45:52,346
My next step is to establish diffuse color values

1071
00:45:52,366 --> 00:45:52,986
for the characters.

1072
00:45:53,566 --> 00:45:55,287
So I use the lasso tool in Photoshop

1073
00:45:55,307 --> 00:45:56,867
to create selections of each material

1074
00:45:56,907 --> 00:45:58,188
represented on each character,

1075
00:45:59,188 --> 00:46:00,429
and then on individual layers,

1076
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:02,309
I fill each selection with a unique color.

1077
00:46:02,749 --> 00:46:04,530
So for example, the skin will be on one layer,

1078
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,851
the leather armor will be on another layer,

1079
00:46:07,091 --> 00:46:08,712
the metal trim will be on another, and so on.

1080
00:46:09,292 --> 00:46:10,432
And the real value of this step

1081
00:46:10,472 --> 00:46:11,913
is that it allows me to control click

1082
00:46:11,933 --> 00:46:13,453
the layer thumbnail of each material

1083
00:46:13,793 --> 00:46:16,054
to restore the corresponding selection whenever I want,

1084
00:46:16,394 --> 00:46:17,835
so I can use them to define masks

1085
00:46:17,895 --> 00:46:19,035
for adjustment layers later on.

1086
00:46:20,917 --> 00:46:22,718
Moving on from there, I render the lighting information

1087
00:46:22,758 --> 00:46:23,698
in the scene in grayscale,

1088
00:46:24,479 --> 00:46:27,080
before introducing the color bias of each light source,

1089
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,361
and then finally combining all of this

1090
00:46:29,381 --> 00:46:31,702
with the diffuse material colors I established earlier

1091
00:46:32,143 --> 00:46:33,503
to achieve a rough approximation

1092
00:46:33,623 --> 00:46:35,625
of the colored and toned lighting environment for the scene.

1093
00:46:35,645 --> 00:46:37,646
Now, everything I've done up to this point

1094
00:46:37,686 --> 00:46:40,187
has really just served to establish an underpainting

1095
00:46:40,747 --> 00:46:42,408
that I can use to start painting on top of.

1096
00:46:43,229 --> 00:46:45,490
But now I can finally start the direct painting stage,

1097
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:47,551
which makes up the bulk of the rest of the process.

1098
00:46:48,251 --> 00:46:48,371
So.

1099
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,580
This is where I finally lose the drawing.

1100
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,761
I reduce the opacity of the line work layer

1101
00:46:52,781 --> 00:46:55,022
and then begin painting in new layers on top of that.

1102
00:46:56,002 --> 00:46:58,403
My process tends to involve a lot of adjustment layers,

1103
00:46:58,463 --> 00:47:00,724
which I prefer to keep live so that I can revise them

1104
00:47:00,744 --> 00:47:01,704
later on if necessary.

1105
00:47:01,724 --> 00:47:04,405
And the downside of this approach is that it eats up

1106
00:47:04,445 --> 00:47:07,006
a ton of memory, so eventually I end up using

1107
00:47:07,046 --> 00:47:09,827
breakout PSDs to work on each character individually

1108
00:47:10,207 --> 00:47:11,207
in separate documents.

1109
00:47:12,148 --> 00:47:13,668
I focus on the characters one by one,

1110
00:47:13,968 --> 00:47:15,669
treating each as its own mini painting

1111
00:47:15,709 --> 00:47:18,330
before reincorporating them into the larger composition.

1112
00:47:18,983 --> 00:47:21,045
And in this case, the dragon counts as a character too.

1113
00:47:23,026 --> 00:47:24,807
So once I'm done with the characters,

1114
00:47:24,987 --> 00:47:26,408
I focus on the surrounding environment,

1115
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:28,989
building in some features from scratch

1116
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,491
and also incorporating some in-game screenshots

1117
00:47:31,531 --> 00:47:33,732
in the background that get heavily painted over

1118
00:47:34,112 --> 00:47:35,233
to save on painting time.

1119
00:47:36,714 --> 00:47:38,275
A lot of surface texture is generated

1120
00:47:38,295 --> 00:47:40,056
through a combination of noisy brushes

1121
00:47:40,216 --> 00:47:41,537
and photo texture overlays.

1122
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:43,778
And then in the later stages of the painting,

1123
00:47:43,858 --> 00:47:46,180
I also do a final dirt and grime pass

1124
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,321
to help things feel convincingly aged and lived in.

1125
00:47:49,843 --> 00:47:52,966
I add in cast shadows for the characters and special effects

1126
00:47:53,466 --> 00:47:55,107
before doing a final color grading pass,

1127
00:47:55,127 --> 00:47:57,429
which is often one of the most important steps

1128
00:47:57,469 --> 00:47:58,490
of the entire process.

1129
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:01,272
This is where I finally establish a cohesive atmosphere

1130
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:04,154
for the illustration and rebalance the lighting and colors

1131
00:48:04,194 --> 00:48:07,056
to increase readability and emphasize compositional elements

1132
00:48:07,577 --> 00:48:09,138
in a way that better supports the narrative.

1133
00:48:09,918 --> 00:48:11,179
And that is basically it.

1134
00:48:11,479 --> 00:48:12,921
Aside from cleaning up the layer groups

1135
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,602
to help the marketing and web guys

1136
00:48:14,622 --> 00:48:15,803
more easily navigate the file,

1137
00:48:16,243 --> 00:48:17,504
I pass it on for publication.

1138
00:48:18,032 --> 00:48:20,775
And then the whole process starts all over again for the next one.

1139
00:48:21,796 --> 00:48:26,801
So that is the end of what I had prepared for today.

1140
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:35,890
So I just want to thank everybody for coming.

1141
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:39,313
I hope you found it worthwhile, and I will be glad to take any questions that anybody

1142
00:48:39,353 --> 00:48:39,814
might have.

1143
00:48:50,412 --> 00:48:53,833
First of all, I have no experience as an artist, but...

1144
00:48:54,173 --> 00:48:55,414
That's so much better.

1145
00:48:55,434 --> 00:48:57,494
This is incredibly insightful.

1146
00:48:57,654 --> 00:48:58,635
I had no idea.

1147
00:48:59,075 --> 00:49:00,575
See, if you're not an artist, you can't tell me

1148
00:49:00,615 --> 00:49:02,196
that I'm wrong about everything you just said.

1149
00:49:02,396 --> 00:49:03,536
Well, yeah, it's the composition.

1150
00:49:03,556 --> 00:49:04,076
Anyway, sorry.

1151
00:49:05,197 --> 00:49:06,197
I've noticed two things.

1152
00:49:06,417 --> 00:49:07,597
There's actually a question,

1153
00:49:08,038 --> 00:49:09,078
I hope this doesn't come off the wrong way,

1154
00:49:09,118 --> 00:49:11,739
but in the initial sketches that you were...

1155
00:49:12,939 --> 00:49:19,524
Given you have these these concepts of like the black ball and the mandate, but you still didn't include

1156
00:49:20,084 --> 00:49:25,609
Characters and those initial sketches that just something from like your own point of passion that you're trying to like be like look

1157
00:49:26,049 --> 00:49:26,870
This is good

1158
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:30,832
See more of this so that you can get it or is that something?

1159
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:34,455
That you've now scrapped in your design process

1160
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:39,183
Yeah, that's a good question. I'm glad you asked it because it's something that I knew I had left out of this presentation.

1161
00:49:39,403 --> 00:49:47,649
His question is why do I keep offering up sketches that don't include player characters from the beginning

1162
00:49:47,969 --> 00:49:50,571
if it just creates problems for me later down the road.

1163
00:49:50,931 --> 00:49:55,615
And part of that is because we're doing this for three and a half years

1164
00:49:55,715 --> 00:49:57,416
and over that length of time we've had different...

1165
00:49:58,635 --> 00:50:01,215
We've had different brand managers come in and out

1166
00:50:01,435 --> 00:50:03,175
of the project on the Bethesda side.

1167
00:50:03,616 --> 00:50:05,216
And so they have different preferences.

1168
00:50:05,236 --> 00:50:08,016
And so the concept of what defines a player character

1169
00:50:08,056 --> 00:50:10,697
and how important that is has shifted over time.

1170
00:50:11,657 --> 00:50:12,917
The other thing too is that,

1171
00:50:13,357 --> 00:50:15,598
because I mentioned three of those challenges,

1172
00:50:15,658 --> 00:50:18,678
but there are a lot more that weren't as important

1173
00:50:18,698 --> 00:50:19,218
to talk about.

1174
00:50:19,258 --> 00:50:23,059
But one of them is that there are oftentimes

1175
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,340
specific angles on the story content

1176
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:28,040
that they're trying.

1177
00:50:28,543 --> 00:50:33,066
to push and a lot of the time the two things contradict each other.

1178
00:50:33,086 --> 00:50:37,249
So you can't tell those stories and also have player characters there that are doing something

1179
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:37,669
important.

1180
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:44,214
And so my initial solution is always to say, look, we can do it this way, but there's this

1181
00:50:44,254 --> 00:50:46,295
hard and fast rule that they typically come back to.

1182
00:50:46,916 --> 00:50:47,576
So that's why.

1183
00:50:47,596 --> 00:50:49,477
Yeah.

1184
00:50:49,497 --> 00:50:52,839
So in some ways it's like a springboard for them to give you alternate feedback?

1185
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:53,420
Is that?

1186
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,180
Yeah.

1187
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:55,081
I mean, that's fair.

1188
00:50:55,141 --> 00:50:55,941
Yeah, I think so.

1189
00:50:56,951 --> 00:51:03,374
I know that I'm not supposed to ask follow-up questions, but there's no sword or there's only swords like how come nobody has anything but swords

1190
00:51:03,674 --> 00:51:06,075
I'm like looking at all this being like is that a hammer?

1191
00:51:06,976 --> 00:51:10,177
Well, so a lot of what I should I think there are

1192
00:51:11,278 --> 00:51:15,240
She says there's a repeating the question. He says there are only swords and why aren't we using other weapons?

1193
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,942
I think there are examples of other weapons in some of the key art the specific one that I broke down

1194
00:51:21,835 --> 00:51:24,776
It just worked out that way. I don't know. I don't have a good answer.

1195
00:51:24,796 --> 00:51:29,157
In a lot of the other sketches though, I'll typically just use a sword as like a stand-in weapon,

1196
00:51:29,237 --> 00:51:34,658
and then typically I'll end up modifying the pose once it gets approved to a more specific weapon.

1197
00:51:35,379 --> 00:51:39,280
Because it doesn't make sense to bother with that kind of detail if the sketch is going to be thrown away anyway.

1198
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,420
Well, thank you so much.

1199
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,080
Yeah, thank you.

1200
00:51:43,044 --> 00:51:46,509
Hi, great talk, great work, great project.

1201
00:51:46,589 --> 00:51:50,416
My question was in regard to getting started with your composition.

1202
00:51:50,436 --> 00:51:53,561
I always find that the most difficult part of composition is getting started

1203
00:51:53,641 --> 00:51:55,684
because when you get started, it's not a composition yet.

1204
00:51:55,925 --> 00:51:57,227
It's a subject or it's a frame.

1205
00:51:58,364 --> 00:52:02,548
And my question was going to be do you start with a subject or do you start with a frame?

1206
00:52:02,748 --> 00:52:07,392
And it looked like in the breakdown of those really simple sketches of the dragon

1207
00:52:07,993 --> 00:52:13,197
you were really focusing on the subject and not quite yet considering what the frame because there was no outline on those sketches.

1208
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:17,421
That is true. And so yeah, I mean I think the way I just work naturally I will

1209
00:52:19,123 --> 00:52:21,345
do I start with a subject or a frame when I'm

1210
00:52:21,988 --> 00:52:23,389
when I'm first beginning the compositions,

1211
00:52:23,429 --> 00:52:25,110
am I worried about how all those elements

1212
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:27,112
will fit inside a particular crop format?

1213
00:52:27,392 --> 00:52:28,133
The answer is no.

1214
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:29,914
Typically, just the way I work,

1215
00:52:29,994 --> 00:52:32,436
I will start by drawing just a character

1216
00:52:32,536 --> 00:52:36,999
on a massive PSD that doesn't have any bounds to it, really,

1217
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,161
and see where it takes me.

1218
00:52:39,521 --> 00:52:41,002
And one of the reasons for that in this case

1219
00:52:41,042 --> 00:52:41,543
is because the,

1220
00:52:43,415 --> 00:52:45,496
The key art that we make, and I left this out of the talk,

1221
00:52:45,516 --> 00:52:49,538
but there are a lot of actual format and crop specifications

1222
00:52:49,558 --> 00:52:50,398
that I have to hit.

1223
00:52:50,759 --> 00:52:51,919
And what that means is that I have

1224
00:52:51,959 --> 00:52:54,640
to build a lot of margin area into every illustration

1225
00:52:54,661 --> 00:52:55,121
that we do.

1226
00:52:55,581 --> 00:52:59,963
So oftentimes, I end up painting this huge scene of a world

1227
00:53:00,023 --> 00:53:02,084
that we only crop in on a small window of.

1228
00:53:03,585 --> 00:53:05,826
The illustration I'm working on right now is like that.

1229
00:53:05,906 --> 00:53:08,127
I've got so much that we're going to have to crop in later.

1230
00:53:09,672 --> 00:53:11,133
stuff outside of that will be wasted work,

1231
00:53:11,214 --> 00:53:12,975
but that's just kind of the way it goes.

1232
00:53:13,255 --> 00:53:14,776
And I wanted to say as part of that,

1233
00:53:15,837 --> 00:53:18,359
there is a sort of paralysis in the early phases

1234
00:53:18,419 --> 00:53:19,320
of doing a concept.

1235
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,882
I'm not sure if you ever feel like you might be

1236
00:53:21,902 --> 00:53:24,384
getting ahead of those requirements or desirements,

1237
00:53:24,904 --> 00:53:25,925
and whether or not you feel like,

1238
00:53:26,005 --> 00:53:28,848
whoa, I can't, like there's a pressure to demonstrate

1239
00:53:28,868 --> 00:53:30,689
that you're making something or that you can make something,

1240
00:53:31,029 --> 00:53:32,971
but also you know that there's stuff out there

1241
00:53:33,011 --> 00:53:34,192
that's not being expressed yet,

1242
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:35,833
you don't wanna start getting ahead of that,

1243
00:53:35,953 --> 00:53:37,574
so like, how do you?

1244
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:39,454
Is there a way in your process to manage that?

1245
00:53:39,654 --> 00:53:43,576
Well, I think I could take your question a couple different ways, but what I would probably

1246
00:53:43,636 --> 00:53:51,340
say is, I think maybe I would rephrase your question as, am I ever concerned that the

1247
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:55,582
people who see my artwork internally will make a judgment on the quality of the composition

1248
00:53:55,602 --> 00:53:59,023
I'm developing before I really get to a point where it's fully been expressed?

1249
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,371
And the answer to that is certainly yes,

1250
00:54:01,431 --> 00:54:03,974
but it becomes less so over time because there

1251
00:54:04,014 --> 00:54:07,737
is a level of trust that gets developed.

1252
00:54:08,138 --> 00:54:10,280
And they've seen enough examples.

1253
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,881
They know how it's more likely to turn out.

1254
00:54:11,941 --> 00:54:14,244
And so they gave me the benefit of the doubt.

1255
00:54:16,966 --> 00:54:18,187
I don't know who was first.

1256
00:54:18,227 --> 00:54:19,228
Do you want to go over here?

1257
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:23,127
They always make these mics for tall people.

1258
00:54:24,268 --> 00:54:27,710
So my question, it is a technical question, so sorry.

1259
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:30,271
But I noticed that you had some meshes

1260
00:54:30,552 --> 00:54:32,213
in some of your sketches, and I was

1261
00:54:32,273 --> 00:54:35,955
wondering if your 3D modeler gave that to you already rigged

1262
00:54:36,015 --> 00:54:37,696
and you just put it in the pose you wanted,

1263
00:54:38,136 --> 00:54:40,698
or if they posed it for you, or if you did it yourself.

1264
00:54:41,238 --> 00:54:43,980
And I also wanted to know what, like,

1265
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:46,081
you don't have to give me actual time hours worked,

1266
00:54:46,181 --> 00:54:48,002
because I hate it when people ask me that question.

1267
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:52,382
But I want to know what your timeline in the whole production phase was.

1268
00:54:53,943 --> 00:54:57,324
Well, I mean, I would say overall, like what typically gets slated,

1269
00:54:57,344 --> 00:55:00,645
that the entire production is supposed to last about eight weeks.

1270
00:55:01,025 --> 00:55:04,706
And we and I do I do overshoot that sometimes, typically

1271
00:55:04,746 --> 00:55:08,347
because there will be problems develop or the art director or someone else

1272
00:55:08,367 --> 00:55:10,348
will make will decide that something's not working.

1273
00:55:10,528 --> 00:55:14,209
And then I need to go back and kind of, you know, retool the illustration.

1274
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:15,169
And that adds time.

1275
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:17,290
So sometimes it gets pushed.

1276
00:55:17,961 --> 00:55:20,462
But eight weeks is what we shoot for in production schedule.

1277
00:55:20,522 --> 00:55:22,503
As to your other question, which was,

1278
00:55:23,803 --> 00:55:25,904
where do the 3D meshes that you kind of see hints of

1279
00:55:25,944 --> 00:55:27,164
in some of my sketches come from?

1280
00:55:28,204 --> 00:55:30,945
The answer there is, it definitely varies.

1281
00:55:31,105 --> 00:55:34,687
So I started my career as a 3D production artist.

1282
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:38,288
So I certainly have the ability to build those myself.

1283
00:55:38,348 --> 00:55:39,988
And I'll typically do that for environments

1284
00:55:40,249 --> 00:55:41,709
or to build like the structure.

1285
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:45,110
Sometimes I'll do like a really rough gray box scene.

1286
00:55:46,011 --> 00:55:49,071
Other times I'll go into ZBrush and turn on Dynamesh

1287
00:55:49,191 --> 00:55:51,552
and sculpt like a face or some kind of object

1288
00:55:51,592 --> 00:55:53,532
that I want to get from a different angle.

1289
00:55:54,712 --> 00:55:58,153
And then finally, in the case of what we looked at today,

1290
00:55:58,193 --> 00:56:00,674
that dragon, I think it's probably what you're talking about,

1291
00:56:00,694 --> 00:56:05,675
there was a really early like proxy for the dragon,

1292
00:56:05,755 --> 00:56:09,356
and that I did not make, but that was, it already existed.

1293
00:56:10,572 --> 00:56:12,993
And I just took the Maya file, or it was Max file,

1294
00:56:13,013 --> 00:56:13,534
but I work in Maya.

1295
00:56:13,574 --> 00:56:16,175
I took the file and I cannot rig,

1296
00:56:16,475 --> 00:56:17,816
and it was not rigged itself,

1297
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,637
so I just basically used pivots

1298
00:56:20,838 --> 00:56:22,238
and put it in the position I wanted.

1299
00:56:22,658 --> 00:56:25,280
And that is still faster than just trying to draw anatomy

1300
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:27,041
that doesn't really exist anyway.

1301
00:56:27,121 --> 00:56:31,523
So you don't wanna go too far into debating with yourself

1302
00:56:31,563 --> 00:56:32,463
whether or not it looks right.

1303
00:56:33,024 --> 00:56:33,304
So yeah.

1304
00:56:34,244 --> 00:56:35,245
Awesome, thank you so much.

1305
00:56:35,445 --> 00:56:35,845
You're welcome.

1306
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:37,751
And then over here.

1307
00:56:38,131 --> 00:56:38,511
Hi, Lucas.

1308
00:56:38,971 --> 00:56:39,672
Thank you for the talk.

1309
00:56:39,732 --> 00:56:42,033
It was really informative and it was really awesome.

1310
00:56:42,053 --> 00:56:43,514
Like your paintings are really awesome, I think.

1311
00:56:43,694 --> 00:56:44,515
Thank you.

1312
00:56:44,795 --> 00:56:46,596
So just one small question is like,

1313
00:56:46,976 --> 00:56:48,377
when you're doing like these key paintings,

1314
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:52,359
how important is for you to do like all the characters

1315
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:55,141
like with exactly as they appear in the concept art

1316
00:56:55,201 --> 00:56:56,482
or exactly as they appear in games?

1317
00:56:56,622 --> 00:57:00,104
Do you have to do it like so that they are like,

1318
00:57:01,005 --> 00:57:02,345
like faithful representations of those

1319
00:57:02,465 --> 00:57:04,167
or are you able to also like change this?

1320
00:57:04,681 --> 00:57:06,742
these concepts to suit the needs of a certain painting.

1321
00:57:06,902 --> 00:57:10,943
Right, so the question is how much flexibility do I have

1322
00:57:11,043 --> 00:57:12,843
in changing the appearance of the characters

1323
00:57:12,883 --> 00:57:15,004
or other things for the key art,

1324
00:57:15,144 --> 00:57:16,744
even if they don't match the concept art

1325
00:57:16,844 --> 00:57:18,125
or the final in-game models?

1326
00:57:18,405 --> 00:57:19,925
The answer is I have a lot of flexibility.

1327
00:57:20,265 --> 00:57:21,806
And it didn't necessarily start out that way,

1328
00:57:21,826 --> 00:57:23,726
but I think that my art director kind of has,

1329
00:57:25,967 --> 00:57:28,508
he understands and firmly believes

1330
00:57:28,568 --> 00:57:30,048
that the illustration is meant to be

1331
00:57:30,068 --> 00:57:32,028
an aspirational depiction of what the game is

1332
00:57:32,088 --> 00:57:34,109
as opposed to a realistic one.

1333
00:57:35,206 --> 00:57:40,890
So I'm allowed to change things, make things look hopefully better and higher fidelity than they would in game or in the concept.

1334
00:57:41,331 --> 00:57:46,254
And also, I'm given a lot of flexibility with what they, with the costuming.

1335
00:57:46,454 --> 00:57:49,717
So oftentimes I will use pieces, like armor pieces from the game,

1336
00:57:50,077 --> 00:57:53,899
but the thing is about the way that we do armor sets in ESO,

1337
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:55,040
there, it's like

1338
00:57:55,602 --> 00:57:58,303
it's a very compartmentalized modular system.

1339
00:57:58,623 --> 00:58:00,644
And so everything kind of has to look similar.

1340
00:58:00,664 --> 00:58:02,785
It has to be very form-fitting to the character.

1341
00:58:02,865 --> 00:58:04,846
We don't have, we can't have fabric hanging off

1342
00:58:04,946 --> 00:58:05,546
and things like that.

1343
00:58:05,586 --> 00:58:07,727
And so one of the things that I like to do

1344
00:58:07,827 --> 00:58:09,128
is just use pieces of that,

1345
00:58:09,188 --> 00:58:11,348
but build kind of something that's more of like a,

1346
00:58:11,468 --> 00:58:13,689
that looks more like a home-built kit.

1347
00:58:13,709 --> 00:58:16,430
You know, things that the character may have found

1348
00:58:16,731 --> 00:58:18,731
and decided to incorporate into their outfit.

1349
00:58:19,512 --> 00:58:22,233
And yeah, and adding different kinds of wear and.

1350
00:58:23,264 --> 00:58:24,904
and fabric hanging and things like that.

1351
00:58:24,964 --> 00:58:28,826
So yeah, I definitely get flexibility when it comes to that.

1352
00:58:29,466 --> 00:58:31,127
And it rarely does it get pushed back.

1353
00:58:31,327 --> 00:58:32,648
Do I get pushed backwards?

1354
00:58:32,668 --> 00:58:35,009
Like, no, you gotta make that look the same, so.

1355
00:58:35,549 --> 00:58:36,370
Okay, thank you. Yeah.

1356
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:40,091
And if that's it, thank you guys so much.
