1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:09,264
Hey. So, I'll apologize in advance if I look very tired.

2
00:00:09,484 --> 00:00:14,387
I just landed at 3am this morning after 50 hours of non-stop traveling.

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,730
So, thanks for joining this presentation about what you can accomplish

4
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,493
and get using a community platform directly embedded in your game.

5
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:27,916
My name is Nicolas Notin. I'm the Senior Community Development Specialist at Flare Games.

6
00:00:28,817 --> 00:00:31,840
We are a free-to-play mobile game publisher based in Germany,

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,462
mostly known for World War II.

8
00:00:34,482 --> 00:00:37,545
Last year we released Zombie Gunship Survival.

9
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:41,716
Which is the game I'm going to be talking about in this presentation.

10
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:48,002
Like many other studios and publishers, for years we used external platforms

11
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:51,124
to develop and engage with our communities.

12
00:00:52,285 --> 00:00:55,688
And most of those have very unfriendly registration process.

13
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:59,451
Players have to leave the game, they have to give up personal information,

14
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:03,535
activate their accounts before joining the community platform.

15
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,237
And usually that leads to very poor conversion.

16
00:01:07,098 --> 00:01:11,940
And so you will end up with a very small community of usually hardcore players

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,180
compared to the amount of players you have in the game.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,882
And those players tend to dominate discussions,

19
00:01:19,422 --> 00:01:22,103
which tends to lead to a lot of toxicity,

20
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:25,604
and make it very hard for community managers and studios

21
00:01:25,665 --> 00:01:30,606
to get large samples of feedback and quantify that feedback as well.

22
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:35,748
And so for Zombie Gunship Survival, we knew we wanted to do something different.

23
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:38,709
We knew we wanted to have something that was easy to access,

24
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:42,710
so we can have high conversion, a lot of engagement,

25
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,651
so that we could build very ambitious community strategies,

26
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:49,292
and something that would let players to share the content,

27
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:54,034
and ideally something that is really easy for developers to implement in the game.

28
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:55,615
So quite a lot of things.

29
00:01:57,396 --> 00:02:02,519
So for ZGS we used the NSDK from a company called KTPlay.

30
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:05,581
So that's what ticked all the boxes for us.

31
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:10,604
There are plenty of other solutions out there, but it's not so much about what you use, it's

32
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:11,845
also how you use it.

33
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:16,644
So this is the landing screen in ZGS.

34
00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:19,886
So when players are not doing anything or crafting items.

35
00:02:20,426 --> 00:02:24,488
And as you can see on the right side of the screen, there is this little icon, community.

36
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:28,810
So players could access the community hub directly from the landing screen.

37
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:31,952
And the community hub will appear as an overlay.

38
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,713
So they will never leave the game when they want to access it.

39
00:02:36,149 --> 00:02:38,771
But more importantly, there is no registration process.

40
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:42,353
So as soon as the players join on the Community Hub,

41
00:02:42,573 --> 00:02:46,115
the account on the Hub is created based on the in-game accounts.

42
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:49,397
Which means that every player we had on the Community Platform,

43
00:02:50,118 --> 00:02:51,699
they were players in the game as well.

44
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,602
And having such an easy access to the platform,

45
00:02:57,503 --> 00:03:01,645
usually we had 40 to 60% of our players who completed the tutorial,

46
00:03:02,246 --> 00:03:05,148
who accessed the Community Hub within the first five hours.

47
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,419
So how does that constrain conversion?

48
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,041
So if we look at the first five months post-release,

49
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:18,303
the conversion of our monthly new players

50
00:03:18,603 --> 00:03:22,765
were between 45% to 50% after completing the tutorial.

51
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:28,450
And if we compare this to Royal River 2, which is a very successful game of our portfolio,

52
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:35,597
the conversion between the game to our old external form was in between 0.1 to 0.3 percent.

53
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:41,563
Although the form is also somewhat surfaced in the game, and the amount of monthly downloads

54
00:03:41,683 --> 00:03:43,444
between the two games were quite similar.

55
00:03:44,947 --> 00:03:50,508
More importantly, using an embedded community platform gives you more information about your audience.

56
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:57,931
As a community manager, we were able to confirm that we are engaging with our most important audience,

57
00:03:58,251 --> 00:04:02,152
which are payers in the case of a free-to-play game on mobile.

58
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:09,435
But if you look at box products, you have more and more games with obviously DLCs, but also in-game shops and crates.

59
00:04:11,565 --> 00:04:16,707
And so we were able to confirm as committee managers that we were engaging with 70 to

60
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,728
almost 90% of our payers.

61
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:25,669
And the amount of payers not engaging on the committee hub got lower and lower over a month.

62
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:32,671
And so having those information, we were also able to confirm that 60 to 80% of the monthly

63
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:37,953
revenue came from the payers who were engaging on the committee hub, which means that as

64
00:04:37,993 --> 00:04:38,753
a committee manager.

65
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:45,495
I am able to adapt my communication strategy better to actually retain those most important

66
00:04:45,575 --> 00:04:51,077
players and also see that their feedback came from players.

67
00:04:51,197 --> 00:04:56,178
So if they complain about something such as in-game shop, it actually came from actual

68
00:04:56,218 --> 00:04:56,538
players.

69
00:04:58,077 --> 00:05:03,421
If we look at the overall population on the community hub we had in ZGS, obviously we

70
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:10,526
had more non-payers, but the amount of payers joining the community hub over months increased.

71
00:05:12,107 --> 00:05:12,967
So having a...

72
00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:19,073
properly surfaced community hub in your game, and if you ensure that it's really easy to

73
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:24,797
access it, you can have, like we did in ZGS, 1.5 million community members, so not players,

74
00:05:24,838 --> 00:05:28,180
community members, on the hub after just one week post-release.

75
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:29,822
It's a lot of traffic.

76
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:33,200
So what about engagements?

77
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,889
So before looking at the metrics, again, it's not so much, it's not just about what you use,

78
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:43,351
it's also how you use it, how you implement it in the game.

79
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:48,737
So this is the community hub, when you put it in the game, it opens as an overlay,

80
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:51,801
and resources where...

81
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:56,402
put into branding the Community Hub so that the immersion wasn't broken.

82
00:05:56,502 --> 00:06:00,584
So we always have, you know, those players complaining about us breaking their immersion.

83
00:06:00,604 --> 00:06:05,266
But at the end of the day, if you brand the Community Hub, it's an easy win to encourage them

84
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,587
to participate, to stay in the game, and to stay in the Community Hub.

85
00:06:11,268 --> 00:06:16,129
They have the most important information at the top, and then easy access to the different

86
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,671
discussion categories, introduction, general discussions, and feedback.

87
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:25,068
And players were able to share screenshots and gameplay videos,

88
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:28,971
so written content like game guides and fan fiction.

89
00:06:29,771 --> 00:06:35,115
So we monitored the gameplay videos before players could publish them,

90
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:40,679
just to make sure there was no inappropriate content or issues with copyrights.

91
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:43,830
For the screenshots, players could post them directly,

92
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,953
but it actually took quite a while before seeing the very first inappropriate content,

93
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:51,055
despite the huge traffic we had on the Community Hub.

94
00:06:52,897 --> 00:06:54,979
And like I said, we had a lot of written content.

95
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:59,022
So you have this really easy-to-access Community Hub directly in your game,

96
00:06:59,702 --> 00:07:04,266
where everyone has an equal opportunity to feel like they can be an evangelist

97
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:06,408
and be part of the community.

98
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:10,391
And not just those who do Let's Plays and streaming, but also those who write fanfiction.

99
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:17,680
So if we look at the time spent on the community hub,

100
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,701
in between D1 and D7, we had an average of 14,

101
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,722
sorry, 15 to 30 minutes per day.

102
00:07:24,462 --> 00:07:27,603
These were usually players who just discovered the platform

103
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:31,604
for the very first time and had a look around,

104
00:07:31,644 --> 00:07:33,725
maybe created the thread to introduce themselves,

105
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:35,745
and then went back to the game to enjoy the content.

106
00:07:36,742 --> 00:07:40,323
Between D8 and D30, the time is doubled.

107
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:44,285
So it's 30 to 70 minutes on the community hub.

108
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:49,048
And those are usually the players who come back to the platform, consume the content

109
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:49,888
created by the community.

110
00:07:50,965 --> 00:07:56,869
experienced players, but also kind of look for information how to get better at the game.

111
00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:01,352
And then again, between D30 to D45, that time is doubled.

112
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:03,794
So 60 to 80 minutes on average per day.

113
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:07,977
And this is usually players who have a little more experience playing the game.

114
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:12,480
And so they will go back to the community hub and feel quite confident sharing feedback,

115
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,144
constructive feedback with the team, which is, as a community manager, the most important

116
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:18,545
thing for a studio and publisher.

117
00:08:22,137 --> 00:08:28,183
So if we look at just the content, so post only, if we compare the amount of content

118
00:08:28,203 --> 00:08:33,889
created on the Community Hub versus the forum we had, again there is a massive gap.

119
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,433
If we look at May for instance, May was only one week.

120
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:40,116
The game was released around the 23rd of May.

121
00:08:40,136 --> 00:08:41,297
And then...

122
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:41,537
And then...

123
00:08:41,557 --> 00:08:41,978
And then...

124
00:08:42,118 --> 00:08:42,438
And then...

125
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,801
We already had almost 30,000 posts created.

126
00:08:47,162 --> 00:08:51,704
They were not all feedback, but a lot of people were just very happy to have easy access to

127
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:54,726
the developers, essentially, super early.

128
00:08:55,946 --> 00:09:02,970
But how does that perform compared to, let's say, a social media channel like Facebook?

129
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:06,012
So we also had a ZGS Facebook page.

130
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:12,978
And here we are looking at the engagements, so only replies and likes on the threads

131
00:09:13,038 --> 00:09:14,900
we created to announce in-game events.

132
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:22,026
And the engagements in between the Community Hub and our Facebook page, it was two to five

133
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:26,009
times higher on the Community Hub, because it's so easy to find information and so easy

134
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:30,753
to access it that it's really easy to come back there and then maybe just leave a like

135
00:09:31,074 --> 00:09:32,215
or a reply or feedback.

136
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:37,398
So talking about feedback, that's a lot of engagement.

137
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,000
Do we get what we need the most as a studio, as a developer,

138
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,181
which is, again, feedback?

139
00:09:43,302 --> 00:09:46,163
So if we look at the week of the 4th of July,

140
00:09:46,744 --> 00:09:49,545
we did an event on the 4th, which ended on the 7th,

141
00:09:50,065 --> 00:09:52,487
and then another event on the 7th, which ended on the 10th.

142
00:09:53,747 --> 00:09:55,769
And the amount of content created

143
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:57,550
in the general discussion section,

144
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,711
so where we post the official announcements,

145
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:02,212
and the feedback section of the community hub,

146
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:07,157
You usually have more content created on the two last days of the event.

147
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:13,660
And those usually come from players who finished the event, maybe earlier than others, went

148
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,203
back to the official announcement or the feedback section, and then share feedback about their

149
00:10:18,223 --> 00:10:19,764
experience playing the in-game event.

150
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:24,903
So, you know, most of the companies who run live ops and in-game events, they already

151
00:10:24,963 --> 00:10:27,385
have data showing the completion rate of an event.

152
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:31,770
You might just assume if the metrics are very high and positive that everything is fine,

153
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:32,991
everyone likes the event.

154
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:39,889
Written feedback can tell you if the players actually completed the event, but they are

155
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:41,070
seriously getting bored of it.

156
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:47,194
If they like the reward or not, if they like the delivery system of the reward, or the

157
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:52,198
description of the event, or maybe the marketing campaign around the event was misleading.

158
00:10:54,426 --> 00:11:01,650
So data can tell you that, but written content, written post feedback can, especially if you

159
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:08,473
have them in very large quantity, you can combine the two and then actually make a decision

160
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:13,255
on how to better improve your live ops so that players don't get too much fatigue.

161
00:11:15,036 --> 00:11:17,077
So what about community strategies?

162
00:11:17,197 --> 00:11:20,579
So everything that has retention, engagement, education.

163
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:29,064
So having so much details about our audience on the community hub, the community team was

164
00:11:29,124 --> 00:11:35,628
able to suggest new ideas, such as cultural and lore events on top of the seasonal events

165
00:11:35,668 --> 00:11:38,449
that everyone does, so like Christmas and Halloween.

166
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:39,410
And so...

167
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:43,789
We knew that if we did an event to celebrate the 4th of July,

168
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,495
or maybe the very first time the AC-130 gunship used in a game

169
00:11:48,755 --> 00:11:52,120
was assigned to its very first military mission 50 years ago,

170
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:54,482
we knew that players would like it.

171
00:11:55,622 --> 00:11:58,445
And those activities, driven by the community team,

172
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:01,087
are very surprising and unexpected.

173
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:04,991
But it also helps to establish diversity at a very low cost.

174
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:07,833
Because the only thing that we did is essentially just

175
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,955
change the picture.

176
00:12:10,556 --> 00:12:11,677
The rewards were the same.

177
00:12:11,837 --> 00:12:14,059
The conditions to finish the events were the same.

178
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,080
But they had different context.

179
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:19,604
And everything becomes just more than a game,

180
00:12:20,064 --> 00:12:22,166
where players can actually maybe learn history.

181
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:25,706
But what about retention?

182
00:12:26,467 --> 00:12:31,609
So this is a graph showing the traffic to the Community Hub and some of the different

183
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:33,029
community activities we did.

184
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:38,412
I'm not going to get into too much detail here about community strategies, but in September

185
00:12:39,352 --> 00:12:44,694
we had an update that implemented the law of changes to the in-game shop and the loot

186
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:48,776
boxes based on the feedback we had received from players on the Community Hub.

187
00:12:49,376 --> 00:12:52,998
And at the beginning of September we did two vlogs to announce those changes.

188
00:12:54,162 --> 00:13:01,187
And so the revenue coming from engaging payers on the community hub who had seen the activities

189
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:04,869
and the vlogs was the highest in those five months.

190
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:10,534
Now the vlogs were not the only reasons why the revenue was the highest, but they helped

191
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:15,777
to establish trust so that when the update actually went live, those engaging payers

192
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:22,275
and players knew what to expect and didn't have to question their purchases basically.

193
00:13:24,396 --> 00:13:31,779
But knowing, having so much information again helps the community team to justify investing

194
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:34,240
more resources into new ambitious ideas.

195
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:43,034
So we had this kind of teasing campaign where we kind of created the character that posted

196
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:47,880
encrypted messages on the community hub and then players had to use their skills.

197
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:52,254
to crack the codes and then get clues to what was coming to the next update.

198
00:13:53,614 --> 00:13:58,757
And so they had to use their video editing skills and we even had players creating C++

199
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:02,558
based apps to automatically crack the code.

200
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:07,020
And seeing this in the mobile game is quite insane.

201
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,121
It's amazing.

202
00:14:09,147 --> 00:14:15,611
And so all of that helps the community to feel connected and to share unique memories.

203
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:19,554
But it also helps the studio to focus on the next update,

204
00:14:20,514 --> 00:14:24,457
and then have an activity just driven by the community team

205
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:29,180
to tease what's coming next in a very safe way, but also a very entertaining way.

206
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,362
So it's like a game within a game,

207
00:14:32,342 --> 00:14:36,005
almost no cost, or at least no cost coming from the development team.

208
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:45,385
So talking about players creating videos and content, if we look at the first five months

209
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:48,705
again, the amount of feedback was quite a lot.

210
00:14:48,825 --> 00:14:50,026
So these are unique threads.

211
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:56,507
So in June, after the first month, it was about a thousand unique threads just about

212
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:57,548
feedback about features.

213
00:14:58,503 --> 00:15:03,029
Then we also had a lot of gameplay videos, but like I said, a lot of written content

214
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:06,473
as well, like game guides and fan fiction.

215
00:15:07,755 --> 00:15:13,402
So all of that, it was a lot of content that we could use in committee spotlights featuring

216
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:15,224
those potential evangelists.

217
00:15:16,335 --> 00:15:21,538
and kind of help educate the players that everyone has an equal opportunity to become

218
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:22,798
someone in that community.

219
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:29,662
And all of that helps to create a positive vibe and get rid of a lot of toxicity.

220
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:36,985
So obviously this was the very first time we actually implemented this platform in our

221
00:15:37,005 --> 00:15:41,367
games, Flare Games, so there are quite a few learnings and best practices to share with

222
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:41,487
you.

223
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:45,635
So one, ensure an easy access.

224
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:49,778
So, and I just not mean the surfacing,

225
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:51,820
but also the way to access the platform.

226
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:55,203
So if you can have it on a landing screen as an icon,

227
00:15:55,543 --> 00:15:57,645
or let's say a building or something like this,

228
00:15:57,845 --> 00:16:02,570
it's a lot easier than actually adding the link

229
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,510
in the sub menu.

230
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:06,333
So if you play, if you work on the box product,

231
00:16:06,373 --> 00:16:08,775
the best way to do it could be maybe in the pause menu.

232
00:16:09,476 --> 00:16:14,599
And rather than having it in a separated tab that says social, you have it just right there, it says form.

233
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,740
Two, branding is key.

234
00:16:17,821 --> 00:16:21,323
Again, there are a lot of players always complaining about us breaking their immersion,

235
00:16:21,443 --> 00:16:29,068
but at the end of the day it could be a very easy win to encourage your players to really participate on the platform.

236
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:35,932
But it also helps to keep everything consistent and keep the branding of your game intact.

237
00:16:37,173 --> 00:16:38,174
Three, proper introduction.

238
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:45,661
So if you have a tutorial, it's definitely a good idea to introduce this community platform to your players.

239
00:16:45,842 --> 00:16:49,164
Even if it's just to say, hey, if you click here, you can join our community.

240
00:16:50,785 --> 00:16:58,930
The monthly conversion we had in ZGS, so this average of 50% every month, we didn't have that.

241
00:16:59,831 --> 00:17:05,595
So I'll let you imagine the potential if you actually introduced your players to the community platform as part of your tutorial.

242
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:07,416
It could be quite high.

243
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:15,800
For prepare deep links and redirect, so it's good to educate your players to know the kind

244
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,601
of the core platform where they can get information and participate with the rest of the community.

245
00:17:21,281 --> 00:17:26,642
But if you are able to redirect your players to somewhere specific, it's even better so

246
00:17:26,682 --> 00:17:31,103
that you can make sure that the most important information are surfaced properly.

247
00:17:31,703 --> 00:17:34,944
And then you can also track if the players come back to the community hub.

248
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:38,083
allow external access.

249
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:45,568
So you can have the choice to allow access in read-only for people who don't play your

250
00:17:45,588 --> 00:17:49,070
game yet, so that they can discover the potential of the community.

251
00:17:50,411 --> 00:17:56,494
But it's also good to have a way for players to visit the community platform, especially

252
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,276
when you have several maintenance or downtime.

253
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:05,813
so that you can keep them posted on the core community platform during those phases where

254
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,394
they cannot access the platform from within the game.

255
00:18:08,414 --> 00:18:11,475
And then six, think long term.

256
00:18:11,596 --> 00:18:19,640
So if you have a, what I call a global portfolio account, like something similar to bottleneck

257
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,581
essentially, imagine the potential.

258
00:18:24,162 --> 00:18:30,724
Those players, if they knew that they could kind of transfer their reputation from a game

259
00:18:30,764 --> 00:18:35,066
to another on the platform that works in the same way, and then they would feel part of

260
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:36,027
your portfolio.

261
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:41,449
And that's great for the players, but also great for community managers.

262
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:43,912
Because when you actually start a new game,

263
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:45,413
you don't have to start from scratch.

264
00:18:46,053 --> 00:18:48,194
You already have your well-established evangelists

265
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,535
that you can trust that understand the rules.

266
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,977
And they will be there from day one.

267
00:18:53,317 --> 00:18:56,038
And they will help you to then educate other new players,

268
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,279
and so on.

269
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,921
So that's pretty much all from my side

270
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:05,223
on using a community platform embedded in the game.

271
00:19:06,264 --> 00:19:08,225
So if you have any questions, please.

272
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:39,632
Hi, thanks for being here.

273
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:43,354
I was going to ask, what kind of information are you getting from your communities?

274
00:19:43,374 --> 00:19:48,257
Is there any kind of like backdoor access that shows you kind of things, information about them,

275
00:19:48,297 --> 00:19:49,598
that maybe they're not aware that you're getting?

276
00:19:49,618 --> 00:19:54,261
Or is it all just like based on what they directly communicate to you?

277
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:58,624
So it's all about tracking essentially, so we don't get information about,

278
00:19:58,844 --> 00:20:01,386
like personal information, like age and gender, we don't get that.

279
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:06,050
because we don't want to have it surface in the first place.

280
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:11,533
But I think there is activities such as looking at the threads,

281
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:14,855
coming back to the community hub,

282
00:20:15,295 --> 00:20:18,137
or engaging on specific threads that we created and so on.

283
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:25,321
So it's purely about tracking activities in between the game and then what happens in the community.

284
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:25,801
So like engagement?

285
00:20:26,262 --> 00:20:26,622
Sorry again?

286
00:20:26,782 --> 00:20:28,663
Like engagement, like what they're engaging with?

287
00:20:29,023 --> 00:20:29,603
Yeah, absolutely.

288
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:32,285
So it's a good way for us to actually determine if...

289
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:39,480
The campaign was successful, like a community activities essentially.

290
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:50,345
Well, first, thank you for mentioning LiveOps, because that's been brought up in my job.

291
00:20:51,406 --> 00:20:57,729
But I'm wondering, I noticed that you said that the platform that you're using, it brings

292
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,590
players in by their player ID.

293
00:21:01,671 --> 00:21:04,773
And I'm just wondering, how does that cross over with like your...

294
00:21:05,353 --> 00:21:08,813
customer support team because in the game that I'm working for,

295
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:12,054
I need that player ID to do almost anything

296
00:21:12,594 --> 00:21:15,575
in a support ticket, which is distinct from community management.

297
00:21:15,675 --> 00:21:17,775
But, you know.

298
00:21:17,855 --> 00:21:20,596
So we don't do customer support on the platform,

299
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:24,916
but the name used on the community hub

300
00:21:25,356 --> 00:21:27,217
will be the same as the one used in the game.

301
00:21:27,877 --> 00:21:31,778
So if you have a game that is a multiplayer focused game,

302
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:37,262
We will usually have a lot of conversations prior to launching the game

303
00:21:38,062 --> 00:21:43,828
to ensure that everything that is unique usernames and so on are there.

304
00:21:44,008 --> 00:21:47,371
So that as a community manager, if I see someone complaining about something,

305
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:50,695
I know I can use the username rather than ask the player,

306
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:53,217
can I have your user ID and so on.

307
00:21:53,317 --> 00:21:54,018
That being said...

308
00:21:54,974 --> 00:22:01,036
We do have access to their unique user ID, which then we can reuse on our platforms.

309
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,457
So there is a way to get that as well.

310
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,639
But in the case of ZGS, I can just use the username.

311
00:22:13,861 --> 00:22:14,421
Any more questions?

312
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:18,122
Okay.

313
00:22:19,202 --> 00:22:19,503
That is one.

314
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,475
Just to preface, I work with him, so this is somewhat a biased question.

315
00:22:26,495 --> 00:22:26,916
That's mean.

316
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:28,318
It's a tricky question.

317
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,040
She's testing me.

318
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:31,902
Spike is very high.

319
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:37,110
Yeah, so your conversion rates were really good for this game, obviously.

320
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,434
What would you do to actually boost those in a future title?

321
00:22:41,726 --> 00:22:46,267
So, like I said, I think having the community platform introduced to players as part of

322
00:22:46,307 --> 00:22:49,448
the tutorial is definitely a good thing to boost that.

323
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:57,050
So we are kind of about to test this in a new game, but I'm fairly confident that as

324
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:02,271
long as your players finish the tutorial and you have made the FTE quite good and quite

325
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:04,571
optimized, there is a chance that you can almost get a 100% conversion.

326
00:23:06,991 --> 00:23:13,634
So that's definitely the core idea to ensure that the conversion is boosted.

327
00:23:14,475 --> 00:23:19,537
Aside from that, everything that is in that message with reminders is also a great thing,

328
00:23:20,177 --> 00:23:21,878
but also think about rewards as well.

329
00:23:22,218 --> 00:23:23,719
So everything that is...

330
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,502
Joining the community and getting these tiny rewards or currencies is also a good way to

331
00:23:29,582 --> 00:23:34,645
encourage players maybe to join for the very first time, but also join, sorry, return the

332
00:23:34,685 --> 00:23:42,209
community platform later. I have a couple questions, so I'll ask them one at a time.

333
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,752
First, how did you decide on the different sections you had in the community? You had

334
00:23:47,952 --> 00:23:52,995
feedback, you had weapons, you had those ones. How did you decide on those? What was the process?

335
00:23:53,695 --> 00:23:55,696
So, obviously, you can customize those.

336
00:23:56,837 --> 00:23:59,158
So, at the beginning, we only had general discussions

337
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:03,119
and feedback and others based on the audience we had in the game.

338
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,901
And then we quickly realized that it might be good to have introduction

339
00:24:07,981 --> 00:24:09,262
because there was so much traffic

340
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:12,103
that we didn't want players to introduce themselves

341
00:24:12,203 --> 00:24:14,484
in sections that were not meant for it.

342
00:24:15,004 --> 00:24:16,745
So, we put introduction at the very top

343
00:24:16,765 --> 00:24:19,366
so that new players who join,

344
00:24:19,406 --> 00:24:22,227
they see that, okay, this is the place where I can create that.

345
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:26,571
General discussion is mainly for announcements and general feedback.

346
00:24:26,992 --> 00:24:30,956
But then we put feedback in third because that's the most important thing for us.

347
00:24:31,396 --> 00:24:37,603
Did you see that once you introduced sections like that, did engagement improve from that?

348
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,083
Engagement...

349
00:24:41,708 --> 00:24:45,952
Yes, obviously, because they know, so there are more sections, obviously, so they tend

350
00:24:45,992 --> 00:24:47,853
to have less traffic.

351
00:24:48,694 --> 00:24:53,038
It's mainly for those that are really looking for specific places to share specific content.

352
00:24:54,219 --> 00:25:00,504
But yeah, if we had put introduction at the very last of the list, then I don't think

353
00:25:00,564 --> 00:25:04,908
it would have impacted the engagement, but I think it would have put more resources into

354
00:25:05,008 --> 00:25:05,568
moderation.

355
00:25:05,729 --> 00:25:08,571
So we would have spent a lot more time to actually move through it around.

356
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:15,473
Since the last question I'll have is sort of the relationship between the community

357
00:25:15,493 --> 00:25:20,634
that you've built within the game to communities that exist outside of the game, like on Facebook

358
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:25,276
and other platforms, what happens in those communities?

359
00:25:25,296 --> 00:25:31,157
Since you've built your own, what need is being served, do you think, by those other

360
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:31,958
Facebook communities?

361
00:25:32,318 --> 00:25:32,458
Yeah.

362
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:38,943
At the time we were quite happy with the algorithm on the Facebook page and so on,

363
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:42,385
and so we would usually have different content as well.

364
00:25:42,866 --> 00:25:45,728
So the core activities could be on the same platforms,

365
00:25:46,589 --> 00:25:50,432
so on the Facebook page and the Community Hub, such as Community Spotlights.

366
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:54,215
But there are specific activities that would work better on Facebook

367
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:56,417
and maybe less on the Community Hub.

368
00:25:57,037 --> 00:26:00,320
And sometimes some of them could actually be seen as spam or...

369
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:03,281
Raffles is a good example.

370
00:26:03,641 --> 00:26:09,583
So on the community hub, we run maybe a competition or a contest, like a creative contest.

371
00:26:10,223 --> 00:26:15,465
On the Facebook page, we would just do a kind of comment here and have a chance to win something.

372
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:20,226
So it's mainly about, you know, thinking about your...

373
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:25,209
communication strategies and kind of find what's best for the different platforms.

374
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:32,474
The advantage of using a community platform directly in your game is that you actually

375
00:26:33,054 --> 00:26:40,440
kind of you're in total control. It's yours. You're not dependent to an algorithm that is made by a

376
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:46,844
third party and if one day it changes then and you don't reach people that's yeah there's nothing

377
00:26:46,864 --> 00:26:47,484
you can do about it.

378
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:49,987
Actually, sorry, one more.

379
00:26:50,007 --> 00:26:53,410
Did, before you introduced the communities

380
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,591
that were within the game,

381
00:26:56,412 --> 00:26:58,373
did you find that there was a lot more activity

382
00:26:58,473 --> 00:27:00,615
on the Facebook communities?

383
00:27:00,675 --> 00:27:02,696
And that obviously as soon as you introduce it

384
00:27:02,737 --> 00:27:04,818
within the game, there's gonna be a lot more people

385
00:27:04,858 --> 00:27:06,219
doing it there than on Facebook, but.

386
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,942
So, in between phase, I can make a comparison

387
00:27:11,002 --> 00:27:13,484
in between not having the community hub

388
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:15,986
and having an external platform like a forum.

389
00:27:16,226 --> 00:27:17,367
So we had the forum before.

390
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:20,849
for a very short time during the beta phase.

391
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:29,196
And obviously, we definitely saw the most hardcore players made the effort to go to

392
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:30,818
the forum, but it stopped there.

393
00:27:31,438 --> 00:27:36,503
So again, if we had kept the forum and not used a community platform like this one directly

394
00:27:36,543 --> 00:27:42,988
in the game, I think we would have ended up with a very small cluster of hardcore games

395
00:27:43,088 --> 00:27:44,209
dominating that platform.

396
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,191
and a lot less potential.

397
00:27:46,211 --> 00:27:53,940
I never imagined seeing so many players writing fanfiction about a game set in a post-apocalyptic context

398
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,063
and using real weapons from the army.

399
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:00,067
For us, it was kind of a shock.

400
00:28:00,827 --> 00:28:01,508
And a good one.

401
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:03,250
Nice cap, by the way.

402
00:28:08,532 --> 00:28:16,035
With the success of building a larger community, did you see a largely increased need for moderation?

403
00:28:16,355 --> 00:28:21,177
Also, especially considering that this is, you know, very tied to your brand at this point?

404
00:28:21,517 --> 00:28:21,637
Yeah.

405
00:28:22,297 --> 00:28:22,878
Yeah, absolutely.

406
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:26,902
I'll be totally honest with you, we didn't expect so much traffic.

407
00:28:28,945 --> 00:28:34,971
You know, it's a good thing, but at the same time, we were prepared internally, so we had

408
00:28:35,152 --> 00:28:40,197
maybe agencies and so on, and it was okay to actually, you know, we had the proper moderation

409
00:28:40,217 --> 00:28:41,839
tools to share the task and so on.

410
00:28:43,615 --> 00:28:47,058
But the good thing using this platform is that you can easily spot

411
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:50,820
and you have more chances to actually find evangelists

412
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,302
who are OK during moderation as well.

413
00:28:54,322 --> 00:28:57,725
So, you know, like maybe a month after release,

414
00:28:57,925 --> 00:29:02,288
I was able to actually find players who were good players.

415
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:05,550
And then I could I had a good feeling I could trust them to.

416
00:29:06,607 --> 00:29:08,708
take on new responsibilities and moderate,

417
00:29:09,808 --> 00:29:13,170
which also helps because it comes from a different perspective, right?

418
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,231
It's not official moderation. It's community moderation.

419
00:29:17,552 --> 00:29:19,793
There is also a lot of features, like built-in features,

420
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:22,334
like if a post is reported multiple times,

421
00:29:22,394 --> 00:29:24,855
it's going to be put in quarantine and so on.

422
00:29:24,915 --> 00:29:30,377
So you already have, like, this SDK already has a lot of pre-built tools

423
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:31,198
to actually do this.

424
00:29:32,118 --> 00:29:32,398
Thank you.

425
00:29:39,166 --> 00:29:39,726
Any more questions?

426
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,831
OK, thank you.
