1
00:00:06,174 --> 00:00:06,794
We made it here.

2
00:00:06,814 --> 00:00:10,075
OK, so I'm supposed to ask you guys to silence

3
00:00:10,155 --> 00:00:14,056
any noisemakers you have and to tell you

4
00:00:14,076 --> 00:00:17,816
that you're going to be getting an email to rate this session.

5
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:22,357
And am I supposed to ask them to move in, scooch in also?

6
00:00:22,377 --> 00:00:24,058
Does that sound right?

7
00:00:25,178 --> 00:00:26,038
Like, toward the center?

8
00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:27,578
Do whatever you want.

9
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:29,499
You know?

10
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,259
Eh, that's what I do.

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,895
Back in 1981, doesn't seem like that long ago,

12
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:46,338
but I was in my apartment in Berkeley

13
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:49,021
and I was playing this game on my Apple II.

14
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:53,805
a dungeon adventure, first-person adventure.

15
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,546
And I'm just sitting there,

16
00:00:55,826 --> 00:00:57,667
and I'm staring down these corridors.

17
00:00:58,187 --> 00:00:59,048
They're not really corridors,

18
00:00:59,068 --> 00:01:00,769
they're just white lines plotted

19
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,609
on this default black background,

20
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:04,310
but it was like I was there.

21
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,051
And I'm looking down this corridor,

22
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:07,832
looking, trying to figure out what's ahead,

23
00:01:08,072 --> 00:01:09,593
like something's gonna jump out at me.

24
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:11,433
And I would spend long nights there

25
00:01:11,453 --> 00:01:14,655
with my list of spells ready to go, typing them in.

26
00:01:16,732 --> 00:01:21,073
Drawn from perspective, I can remember hardly sleeping for days up all night,

27
00:01:21,554 --> 00:01:24,355
staring there, trying to figure out where I was going next.

28
00:01:24,895 --> 00:01:26,276
There wasn't anything to see.

29
00:01:27,816 --> 00:01:32,798
Basic sort of a game written in Pascal, higher level language, on an Apple II.

30
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:36,180
So it was really clunky and slow, but it was real for me.

31
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,761
That's my experience.

32
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:42,563
Seems unbelievable today when we think back on something like that.

33
00:01:42,663 --> 00:01:43,883
In a gaming industry.

34
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:50,870
and a motion picture industry that's so wrapped up in computer-generated realism,

35
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,332
the graphics are so vivid today,

36
00:01:54,053 --> 00:01:58,117
where graphical complexity, it seems to me, is sort of taking over things.

37
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:02,780
and is more central sometimes in the content behind it,

38
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:07,144
which back in these old times was all that the games really were about.

39
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,587
And you'd think that the graphical realism in movies and in games

40
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:13,889
would draw us in powerfully, but sometimes they don't today.

41
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:14,750
It's not always the case.

42
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:19,294
But it was out of those nights in my apartment back in 1981, 1982

43
00:02:19,494 --> 00:02:23,257
that The Bard's Tale came to be,

44
00:02:23,337 --> 00:02:26,920
because I saw a lot of possibility in this game in Wizardry.

45
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,210
in uh all right

46
00:02:33,313 --> 00:02:35,514
I wanted to experience more as I was playing this game.

47
00:02:35,634 --> 00:02:37,235
I'm looking down these corridors and I'm thinking,

48
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:40,256
I have so many ideas for things I want to do in this game

49
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:41,197
that I can't do.

50
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:43,578
And that's where Bard's Tale really came like.

51
00:02:43,638 --> 00:02:45,458
I wanted people to surpass the limits.

52
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:47,739
I wanted to surpass the limits in the game.

53
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:49,060
I wanted to go through walls.

54
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,000
You know, I wanted to do more things

55
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,041
than were in the game.

56
00:02:52,061 --> 00:02:55,562
And that started, my experiences in Wizardry

57
00:02:56,202 --> 00:02:57,843
gave rise to this idea that I had

58
00:02:57,883 --> 00:02:59,744
about something more powerful and more vivid.

59
00:03:00,424 --> 00:03:06,208
People have written me over the last 30 years and tracked me down at different points and found me and said,

60
00:03:06,308 --> 00:03:08,389
I want to tell you this game changed my life.

61
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:13,272
It's weird to hear that, you know, thinking about putting this together when I was a young guy.

62
00:03:14,273 --> 00:03:15,554
Many people have told me that.

63
00:03:15,574 --> 00:03:17,495
They didn't just tell me it was fun for them or whatever,

64
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:20,037
but there was something life-changing about the game for them.

65
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:22,798
And you've probably had that kind of experience at some point in your life

66
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:24,900
where you've seen a movie or read a book or something and it...

67
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:26,741
and it changed your life in some way,

68
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:28,843
where you didn't feel like you were just wasting your time

69
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:31,185
playing it or, you know, like how you watch tons of TV

70
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:32,006
and then later you think,

71
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:33,487
man, I just wasted all that time,

72
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:34,568
I feel horrible right now.

73
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:37,450
But sometimes there are experiences

74
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,672
that come from things like this that change us.

75
00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:43,515
and you get something from it for yourself.

76
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:44,936
And we don't see it a lot.

77
00:03:45,116 --> 00:03:48,118
And we have movies today that have these amazing effects

78
00:03:48,178 --> 00:03:50,539
and no soul, and it leaves me with questions.

79
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,800
It probably leaves you with questions.

80
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,082
Like why couldn't Lucas replicate the success

81
00:03:55,142 --> 00:03:57,083
of the first three movies in the next three

82
00:03:57,284 --> 00:03:59,805
with all the extra money and technology

83
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:00,446
yet available to him?

84
00:04:00,606 --> 00:04:01,887
What happened in there?

85
00:04:01,927 --> 00:04:03,928
And even the ones that are being made today

86
00:04:04,128 --> 00:04:05,149
sort of leave me cold.

87
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:07,570
It's not the same experience anymore.

88
00:04:08,688 --> 00:04:12,229
Well, I'm going to take you on a little journey through my experience on Bard's Tale,

89
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:17,432
and part of my goal in this session is to give you a hint as to what I think one of the answers to that might be.

90
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:22,694
I don't want to oversimplify it, but I want to give you a clue and hopefully inspire a vision in your mind,

91
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:29,076
if you're a game designer or creator, maybe to avoid some of that and end up with something that's not just a game,

92
00:04:29,116 --> 00:04:32,118
but something that's an experience that impacts people's lives,

93
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:34,919
which is something you have control over.

94
00:04:36,001 --> 00:04:40,627
So first I'm going to cover some history about this and then I'm going to cover some philosophy,

95
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:45,834
some of my philosophy behind design and I'm going to even throw in a little bit of theology

96
00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:46,615
but just a little bit.

97
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:52,446
So before I knew anything about coding, I was designing Dungeons and Dungeons and Dragons,

98
00:04:53,146 --> 00:04:54,628
which is where Bard's Tale started.

99
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:57,110
It started, you know, sort of Game Top playing.

100
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,394
And I was in high school, and they tried to launch a Dungeons and Dragons club in high

101
00:05:02,454 --> 00:05:04,256
school, and I showed up.

102
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:07,359
That's me, and I made the yearbook shot.

103
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:10,041
I show up, but it was being run by these nerds.

104
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:11,102
This was the problem.

105
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:13,464
And when I say that, please understand, I was a nerd.

106
00:05:14,571 --> 00:05:17,392
but these guys have like paper mache armor on

107
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:20,973
crowns made from you know uh... construction paper and things like that

108
00:05:20,993 --> 00:05:22,753
they weren't serious about the game

109
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:26,674
so i ended up uh... making the yearbook but i ended up leaving the leaving the

110
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:27,635
club after that

111
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:31,076
but but my name got around a little bit because of that and so i was walking

112
00:05:31,116 --> 00:05:33,836
on the quad of our high school in these two guys walk up to me

113
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,127
in letterman jackets

114
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:39,929
and their their football players normally i was startled they walk up to

115
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:42,691
me because i was like one of these invisible guys in high school right that

116
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:44,712
that normally does like this would not talk to you

117
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:48,674
and they walked up and talk to me and they said hey we hear that you put

118
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:49,534
dungeons together

119
00:05:49,554 --> 00:05:52,196
uh... we play dungeons and raggeds would you like to take us

120
00:05:52,556 --> 00:05:53,256
through a dungeon

121
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:54,597
and i'm like sure

122
00:05:54,617 --> 00:05:59,539
uh... i was uh... blown away and uh... these two guys their names were at one

123
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,061
was john perry and the other guys name was brian fargo

124
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:06,464
now brian you know it's funny cuz he talks about himself as being a nerd

125
00:06:06,524 --> 00:06:08,467
sometimes back from this time is brian here

126
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:10,771
right now he did he make it to this uh...

127
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,275
uh... he's here but i he's busy this week

128
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:14,037
uh... he

129
00:06:15,477 --> 00:06:18,178
he talks about himself being a nerd but you know something he was a super popular

130
00:06:18,238 --> 00:06:18,518
kid

131
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,820
in uh... in high school he was a track star at our high school and he played

132
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,260
football

133
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,162
uh... but uh... but he played Dungeons and Dragons and uh... some of the other

134
00:06:26,182 --> 00:06:29,243
guys on the football team did and so i ended up taking these guys through some

135
00:06:29,283 --> 00:06:29,784
dungeons

136
00:06:30,284 --> 00:06:32,285
at that time which was really awesome for me

137
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:36,467
because uh... i got invited to all these great parties that brian would throw at

138
00:06:36,507 --> 00:06:39,748
his house at his parents house his parents through these outrageous parties

139
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:40,669
for high school students

140
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,630
and I ended up getting invited to those,

141
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,371
and it was, which was really awesome.

142
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:46,112
And it was one of the greatest things about Brian

143
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,273
is though he had this nerdy friend,

144
00:06:48,313 --> 00:06:49,393
like he didn't care at all,

145
00:06:49,813 --> 00:06:52,055
and just absolutely never,

146
00:06:52,075 --> 00:06:54,356
Brian's never cared about what anybody thinks about anything

147
00:06:54,836 --> 00:06:55,876
and it was one of the great things

148
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:57,077
that made him such a great friend.

149
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:59,378
And I ended up having the benefit of that

150
00:06:59,438 --> 00:07:01,599
and getting to talk to some real girls,

151
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:04,781
which was the first time in my life that it ever happened.

152
00:07:06,327 --> 00:07:08,910
But I was an artist. That was kind of my thing at this time.

153
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,055
And I drew these line art, kind of comic book style illustrations.

154
00:07:13,155 --> 00:07:14,737
It was my hobby.

155
00:07:15,618 --> 00:07:17,460
And what I would do is I'd illustrate these dungeons.

156
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,824
So I'd actually, all the major rooms that you'd go into,

157
00:07:21,045 --> 00:07:23,067
I'd have a pretty elaborate illustration for it.

158
00:07:23,507 --> 00:07:27,469
and the illustrations would contain clues and puzzle pieces to the adventure.

159
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,212
And I would write it kind of in a way it was more of a script, more like a book story.

160
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:37,894
It wasn't like a lot of the stuff that the campaigns of the creators of Dungeons & Dragons were coming out with at that time.

161
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:42,016
So these guys really liked the dungeons, you know, and they'd be studying the illustrations trying to figure out,

162
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:44,638
you know, how I was going to kill their guys or whatever.

163
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:48,639
and uh... you know but i i get a lot of magical items i didn't really follow the

164
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:51,540
rules for doing this thing correctly but uh... the guys always had a great time

165
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,181
playing my games and i get to hang out with these guys and we got to sergeant

166
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:56,422
pepperoni's pizza parlor

167
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:59,823
and they have stand-up arcade games in the back

168
00:07:59,843 --> 00:08:02,044
and missile command asteroids

169
00:08:02,804 --> 00:08:06,665
uh... space invaders these kind of things and uh... me and and brian and

170
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:08,966
some of these other guys and we play these games all the time and and that

171
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:12,387
really was the gaming industry at that point there was nothing else at that

172
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:12,767
stage

173
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:17,860
Those right about that time, Brian's parents bought him an Apple 2 computer.

174
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,821
And I remember going over to his house and walking in,

175
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:22,743
I'm looking at this thing and he's trying to explain to me what it is.

176
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:24,725
Because at first, it's, I don't get it.

177
00:08:24,785 --> 00:08:28,328
And I'm starting to wrap my mind around it as he's talking about it.

178
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:31,190
And he's showing me this interface for basic programming.

179
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,892
And I'm like, wait a minute, can you play games on this?

180
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:36,911
And he says, yeah, actually, there's a couple games out.

181
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,094
And so I sit down, and he's showing me some basic

182
00:08:40,134 --> 00:08:41,215
programming right there.

183
00:08:41,315 --> 00:08:45,279
And so he and I end up developing a game together.

184
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,361
He and I were both coding it.

185
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:50,565
There in his parents' house, we started writing a game

186
00:08:51,065 --> 00:08:52,407
called Labyrinth of Mardagon.

187
00:08:52,427 --> 00:08:55,009
It was a text-based adventure written in BASIC.

188
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,931
And I drew the cover.

189
00:08:57,832 --> 00:09:03,415
And we got it printed up at a good friend of mine's dad owned a civil engineering firm

190
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,617
and he's actually sitting here in the front row from high school.

191
00:09:05,997 --> 00:09:10,240
And he printed up copies for us and Brian and I took this around, Paragon Gaming.

192
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:16,083
We took this around and distributed it at a bunch of computer stores in Orange County.

193
00:09:16,904 --> 00:09:19,986
and actually thought we were doing real game development with this.

194
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:21,166
But it's a crackup.

195
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,007
He sent me that picture a number of years ago,

196
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,948
just thinking back on these days.

197
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:28,350
But this is where it all started, in my relationship

198
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,631
with Brian in high school and doing some gaming.

199
00:09:31,395 --> 00:09:34,496
We had no idea how to do graphics at this point.

200
00:09:34,576 --> 00:09:36,037
It was just completely beyond us.

201
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:39,899
But I was really interested, and I had a knack for development.

202
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:41,599
And just the way the computer worked,

203
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:44,141
it made perfect intuitive sense for me.

204
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,122
I've always kind of had both right and left brain things going on.

205
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:50,523
So I really got into it, and also creatively into it.

206
00:09:50,904 --> 00:09:52,865
And so by the time I graduated from high school,

207
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,485
I could develop in 6502 assembly language.

208
00:09:56,206 --> 00:10:01,312
and i was writing full video games uh... like platform games and ships moving

209
00:10:01,332 --> 00:10:01,832
around and

210
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:04,675
things like that sound effects i'd i'd done that

211
00:10:05,096 --> 00:10:07,919
so then i was up in northern california went up to berkeley to study

212
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,740
architecture

213
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:12,464
because i was trying to find some sensible career connected to my uh...

214
00:10:12,624 --> 00:10:13,385
illustration

215
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:16,288
but i uh... i spent all my time programming

216
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:20,894
and writing games and that led me to late evenings playing wizardry and just

217
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:22,195
blowing off my classes

218
00:10:23,076 --> 00:10:27,420
and as I was playing wizardry I kept thinking I could do something so much

219
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,422
better than this because for one I could write it in assembly language

220
00:10:30,842 --> 00:10:34,405
and it would be uh... you know so much faster and more powerful than what I was

221
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,386
getting from wizardry

222
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,169
I mean you could actually see the lines plot like it was so slow

223
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,573
and I knew that I could at least you know do that instantly in writing it

224
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:48,637
So I wrote the code to do the front-facing 3D view that Wizardry had.

225
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:54,903
That was sort of my first move, where you take a matrix of numbers that represent places on this dungeon floor,

226
00:10:55,283 --> 00:10:58,206
with numbers representing each of the doors and things like that,

227
00:10:58,606 --> 00:11:02,409
and then it got translated into this first-person view, you know, drawn.

228
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,351
sort of in perspective, not really, but

229
00:11:06,072 --> 00:11:09,294
but giving you that sense of actually standing there. I had that going where I

230
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:10,555
could walk around a dungeon.

231
00:11:10,855 --> 00:11:14,377
That was the first thing that I did. So then I called Broderbund Software,

232
00:11:14,938 --> 00:11:18,700
which was up also in the Bay Area, and I called and I said I wanted to come in

233
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,221
and show them a prototype for a game.

234
00:11:20,241 --> 00:11:24,444
Now at this point I'm delivering pizzas in North Oakland, okay, so it was kind of an

235
00:11:24,504 --> 00:11:27,486
interesting and sketchy thing for me to do. That's what I was doing.

236
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:30,168
So I was really kind of hoping maybe I could do some game development.

237
00:11:30,568 --> 00:11:33,731
So I went up to Broderbund and I brought this prototype,

238
00:11:33,771 --> 00:11:35,813
which just really was this movement piece,

239
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:39,457
and demoed it for a guy that turns out was the president of the company.

240
00:11:41,425 --> 00:11:44,886
uh... it had no other game action on this prototype it was just this movement

241
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:49,107
thing and i'm just describing to this guy all my ideas for what this could be

242
00:11:49,187 --> 00:11:51,328
so much greater than wizardry is and then when the three

243
00:11:51,688 --> 00:11:54,809
and and and i was about a ten minute demo because you know it's just that

244
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:56,809
piece of it so it was very interesting

245
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,651
and the guys is looking at it with a blanket expression on his face i don't

246
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:01,251
remember his name

247
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:04,934
uh... but i he he was looking at will blank expression on his face

248
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:09,578
and then after my demos done i'd get a forty five minute lecture from him on

249
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:10,939
what a real game is

250
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,263
and what makes it fun and i find out i'm a stupid kid

251
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:18,906
uh... who doesn't know what he's doing and i get kicked out of the office

252
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:21,508
back to delivering pizzas

253
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:25,812
but i'm sitting in the back of a shakespeare class of this big lecture

254
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:26,773
hall at berkeley

255
00:12:27,233 --> 00:12:28,274
bored out of my mind

256
00:12:28,294 --> 00:12:29,675
i'm in the back row

257
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:34,022
and i'm looking reading the daily cal the school newspaper there's an ad in

258
00:12:34,042 --> 00:12:37,883
there for video game programmers people who get they were looking for students

259
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:40,864
who develop in sixty five with two assembly language to do some video game

260
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:43,564
development i'm reading this out of my this is what i do

261
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:47,605
so i contact the guy and it turns out that a company that was in south san

262
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:49,466
francisco called has where was was

263
00:12:49,926 --> 00:12:53,086
opening an office in berkeley cuz they were trying to find some developers

264
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,647
people who knew how to do the sort of thing there were a lot of people didn't

265
00:12:55,787 --> 00:12:56,727
even knew how to do it

266
00:12:57,347 --> 00:12:59,588
and they thought they could find some by the campus.

267
00:13:00,048 --> 00:13:01,969
And I went in, I called the guy and I said,

268
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,929
do you have an Apple? I'll come in and demo.

269
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,310
I got an arcade game I can demo for you that's fully functional.

270
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,971
And he says, no, I don't even have an Apple here,

271
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,351
I have a VIC-20 or something.

272
00:13:10,411 --> 00:13:11,792
And he says, I'm going to get an Apple in here.

273
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,912
I'll go, I'll bring my Apple in.

274
00:13:12,932 --> 00:13:15,233
So I put it in a suitcase and I didn't have a car,

275
00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:17,833
so I had to get on a bus and take a bus downtown.

276
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:22,396
Because I was mostly riding my bike back and forth from my, where I was living to school,

277
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:25,998
but I couldn't, you know, ride a bike with this, you know, I don't know, it was pretty

278
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,099
heavy all this stuff.

279
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:32,082
So I ended up going down and setting it up, plugging it into his monitor and demoing my

280
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,462
game for him and I got hired on the spot.

281
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:37,285
And I did that part-time for a semester and then I'm realizing I do not want to be an

282
00:13:37,325 --> 00:13:41,747
architect, I want to do this, and so I bailed out on school and I ended up working there

283
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:42,228
full-time.

284
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:48,593
And I ended up doing a bunch of platform games for them, a lot of conversions, you know,

285
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:53,597
Donkey Kong for the Apple, and Super Zaxxon, and things like that for the Commodore 64.

286
00:13:54,338 --> 00:13:59,662
But I had a concept for this game, and I already had this prototype built, so I said to him,

287
00:13:59,702 --> 00:14:02,765
listen, could I do a wizardry game for the Commodore 64?

288
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:07,106
He goes, well, all the titles we're doing right now are cartridge titles.

289
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:09,607
We're not doing any floppy disk-based titles.

290
00:14:09,627 --> 00:14:12,628
So if you could get it into a 16K cartridge,

291
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:14,869
then yes, we'd be interested in that.

292
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:16,189
Okay, 16K.

293
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,570
Like, your emails are bigger than that, right?

294
00:14:19,711 --> 00:14:19,931
16K.

295
00:14:20,211 --> 00:14:21,591
So I'm like, yeah, no problem.

296
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:24,312
So I started working on this thing,

297
00:14:24,672 --> 00:14:27,773
and I did a product for them, which was called Mazemaster.

298
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:30,836
So this is sort of the next step in the evolution of Bard's Tale.

299
00:14:30,856 --> 00:14:39,225
This was 16k and it was in fact a very stripped down, minimalistic version of what would later

300
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:47,633
become Bard's Tale with wireframe lines for the corridors and then a few party members

301
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:49,315
and some simple spell casting.

302
00:14:49,835 --> 00:14:52,977
So I developed this, it was, you know, obviously graphically pretty primitive,

303
00:14:52,997 --> 00:14:55,858
but notice how I made the window so much bigger than Wizardry's for the corridor,

304
00:14:55,918 --> 00:14:56,838
as though that would matter.

305
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:01,760
But, you know, to me it was like, see, I'm even more, like, in that corridor now.

306
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:07,142
And, anyway, so this came out, and I was at CES after this was released,

307
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,423
and I'm standing in the HESware booth.

308
00:15:10,183 --> 00:15:13,424
uh... you know my game my title all the titles around and i happen to be

309
00:15:13,464 --> 00:15:15,405
standing there in the sales people don't know who i am

310
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:19,086
is a very weird company people that were running it did not know what they're

311
00:15:19,106 --> 00:15:22,087
doing but i'm standing there in a sales person's and a distributor comes up

312
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:25,548
and walks right over my time is is what's this i'm really interested

313
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:28,869
and the distributor says now you do you you don't want to get that come over

314
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:30,890
coming to show you this you know arcade game we have

315
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:34,551
andy lee the distributor away and i'm like what is going on with these people

316
00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:36,951
but that company was out of business like two years later

317
00:15:37,872 --> 00:15:43,495
So I continued working there and then I ended up in Southern California again hanging out with my parents

318
00:15:44,195 --> 00:15:49,979
Wondering what I was going to do next and I ended up getting a call from Brian Fargo who at that time had

319
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,986
broken off from another company he was working for that had a couple different

320
00:15:54,026 --> 00:15:56,866
interests but one of the things they were doing was making games

321
00:15:57,426 --> 00:16:00,507
and he had broken off and taken the programmers with them and started his

322
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:01,067
own company

323
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:05,568
Interplay Productions. So he said, hey, what are you up to? I go, well I'm, you

324
00:16:05,588 --> 00:16:08,589
know, doing some work up in Northern California. I was actually doing a

325
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:11,890
project for a company in San Jose right then, but I was just independent

326
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,871
and he said, why don't you come down and work for me down here? And I said, okay.

327
00:16:16,571 --> 00:16:17,111
So I ended up...

328
00:16:18,216 --> 00:16:21,179
Moving back down, Southern California, which is where I was from originally,

329
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,381
takes me kind of away from the game industry, but

330
00:16:23,902 --> 00:16:26,844
gave me this opportunity to be close to my folks again,

331
00:16:27,525 --> 00:16:30,708
and also to work on some stuff with Brian.

332
00:16:31,048 --> 00:16:34,512
But I had this on the back burner, I had the whole barge tail thing on the back burner.

333
00:16:35,132 --> 00:16:37,254
and I really wanted to just get to that,

334
00:16:37,694 --> 00:16:39,835
but I needed also, you know, make a living.

335
00:16:39,855 --> 00:16:41,616
So I was doing some conversions for Brian,

336
00:16:41,676 --> 00:16:43,838
and I don't remember what he had me working on at first,

337
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:45,179
but it was really boring.

338
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,940
Something like educational product of some kind,

339
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,581
and I was really bored out of my mind.

340
00:16:50,102 --> 00:16:52,003
So I finally thought, you know something,

341
00:16:52,063 --> 00:16:53,624
I really wanna work on my game.

342
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:57,747
So I'm going to partner with Brian in this, because he's my buddy.

343
00:16:58,047 --> 00:17:01,329
So I said, OK, Brian, I've got a game concept,

344
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:02,790
and I've got a prototype built.

345
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,972
And it was further along at that point.

346
00:17:05,012 --> 00:17:07,353
So there were actually, there was text,

347
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:10,656
there were some characters that were being printed.

348
00:17:10,716 --> 00:17:15,219
And I'd done some work replacing these 3D wireframes with bitmaps.

349
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:18,860
I'm one day I was just staring at these wireframes and I'm realizing wait a minute

350
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,001
I'm looking at the graph paper these things fall in these you know discrete rectangles

351
00:17:23,081 --> 00:17:27,502
I could just stitch together some bitmaps and probably get something more realistic looking

352
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:32,763
Which was what my interest was because I wanted to put I wanted to be in the corridor

353
00:17:32,823 --> 00:17:38,704
You know and and to the degree that the interface wasn't real looking it was sort of not transparent

354
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,265
It wasn't allowing me to sort of enter into the adventure

355
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:45,066
So I thought if I can make it more realistic I can I can realize this goal that I had

356
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,947
And so that's what I did.

357
00:17:48,027 --> 00:17:49,767
I ended up building this prototype,

358
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:50,628
and then I gave it to him,

359
00:17:50,648 --> 00:17:52,468
and I showed it to him, and he was excited about it.

360
00:17:52,508 --> 00:17:54,549
He says, yes, let's do this.

361
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:58,710
And he took it, and we actually had a CES right after that,

362
00:17:58,751 --> 00:18:00,391
and he took it and showed it to Electronic Arts,

363
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:01,491
and they were fired up about it.

364
00:18:01,852 --> 00:18:04,452
So then I ended up being able to work on my own product

365
00:18:04,913 --> 00:18:07,293
at that point, and Bard's Tale began.

366
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:09,802
I don't know what to say about it.

367
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,183
So here's me at Interplay with the guys

368
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:15,084
that were part of the company at that time, that was it.

369
00:18:15,564 --> 00:18:18,525
And we were in this little business complex in Irvine,

370
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:26,608
just like all of us in kind of about the 18 to 22, 23 range

371
00:18:26,768 --> 00:18:28,629
starting Interplay off.

372
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:31,270
But it was a lot of fun.

373
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:34,091
It was a great time actually in my life hanging out.

374
00:18:35,591 --> 00:18:37,392
And I was back down in Southern California,

375
00:18:37,412 --> 00:18:37,952
which was great.

376
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:43,933
So I kept working all those years on a bigger concept for my game.

377
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:48,536
And one of the things I'd come up with as I was up in Berkeley

378
00:18:48,636 --> 00:18:53,079
working on the prototype for this game was this idea of having seven different spellcasting classes.

379
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,402
I really like magic. I was really bored by melee combat.

380
00:18:57,863 --> 00:18:58,723
Wasn't interesting to me.

381
00:18:59,284 --> 00:19:03,867
And I didn't understand, I mean, why couldn't you cast spells and also hold a sword?

382
00:19:03,887 --> 00:19:05,528
I mean, how hard can that really be?

383
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:10,031
And I'm picturing, you know, I'm picturing Lord of the Rings and Gandalf with the sword anyway.

384
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:13,494
I'm like, what's up with this? Why do we have to have this class differentiation?

385
00:19:13,874 --> 00:19:17,276
Because I would expect to be able to do both things if it was me.

386
00:19:17,577 --> 00:19:21,820
And that was the whole idea, was me being, you know, in the adventure.

387
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,422
That was my conception. That's the whole way I look at gaming.

388
00:19:24,722 --> 00:19:29,543
So I think, no, I can learn how to swing a sword as I'm developing as a spellcaster.

389
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:32,903
So I ended up with this idea of seven different spellcasting classes,

390
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:34,524
seven different magical disciplines,

391
00:19:34,824 --> 00:19:37,625
and I started generating lists of spells for those disciplines.

392
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:40,105
And I had this idea of mastering all of them,

393
00:19:40,185 --> 00:19:43,946
so you could actually go from one class to another class

394
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,447
once you mastered it until you mastered all of them,

395
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:50,408
and then you'd become the archmage, the master of the seven magics.

396
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:52,168
And I was thinking, maybe I'll even call it that.

397
00:19:52,448 --> 00:19:53,748
That was my idea at the time.

398
00:19:54,348 --> 00:19:54,388
Um...

399
00:19:54,789 --> 00:20:00,151
Melee was just a backup thing for me, you know, if your spell points run out, then you gotta, you know, use a sword or something like that.

400
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:04,293
So there was this enormously long list of spells at this point that I'd written down.

401
00:20:04,513 --> 00:20:09,935
But the ideas behind the spells were suggesting ideas for the game, because I'm thinking, okay, one of the classes is conjuring.

402
00:20:10,235 --> 00:20:12,196
So this person, you know, conjures things. So there was...

403
00:20:12,456 --> 00:20:17,718
So I'm like, okay, so then you need a way to have conjured things in your party fighting for you.

404
00:20:17,998 --> 00:20:19,799
So this whole concept of conjuring and then...

405
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,860
mind controlling and bringing things, I'd never heard of anything like this, but I'm thinking,

406
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,101
but of course, I would need that, so then I'd need monsters that were able to function

407
00:20:28,581 --> 00:20:32,142
autonomously, but still be part of your party, so I'd need a slot

408
00:20:32,182 --> 00:20:35,962
for them in your list of characters so that they could do that. So these were some

409
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:40,143
of the concepts that I was putting together, which I hadn't seen before

410
00:20:40,183 --> 00:20:43,944
in a game, but they just intuitively came out of the ideas, just, and

411
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:47,085
my background and interest in all the different spellcasting classes.

412
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,266
And design's like that, you know, isn't it like that?

413
00:20:50,346 --> 00:20:53,007
Where one idea leads you to another idea,

414
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:54,808
where you have a great idea and then you think of

415
00:20:54,848 --> 00:20:57,850
a really amazing way to implement it in the game.

416
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,011
You don't necessarily jump to the perfect idea

417
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:01,772
from the beginning.

418
00:21:01,852 --> 00:21:04,133
Sometimes you have to start with a kernel idea like that.

419
00:21:04,453 --> 00:21:06,194
and then it just stimulates creativity.

420
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:08,756
It's like adding spells with duration.

421
00:21:08,776 --> 00:21:10,497
So I had a light spell and I'm thinking,

422
00:21:10,577 --> 00:21:12,378
okay, Wizardry's got no animation,

423
00:21:12,718 --> 00:21:14,319
but I'm doing all this video game development,

424
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,281
I can make a flickering torch appear

425
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:18,282
when your light spell's going.

426
00:21:18,302 --> 00:21:19,403
I think that would look cool.

427
00:21:19,763 --> 00:21:23,987
But then I'm realizing I could make a lot of spells that last over time,

428
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:28,831
that have a certain function and are also represented graphically by some kind of icon.

429
00:21:28,991 --> 00:21:33,135
Because now I've got a section of the screen where this, you know, torch thing is gonna appear,

430
00:21:33,195 --> 00:21:34,716
so then what else am I gonna put over here?

431
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:37,158
So then I'm starting to think about other kinds of spells.

432
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:40,822
Like, what if there's a compass that actually appears and turns?

433
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,564
Then you're actually— it's not only, you know, serving a function,

434
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:46,927
but there's a reason for it being a graphical icon on the screen.

435
00:21:47,427 --> 00:21:52,350
And then I'm thinking, what about other spells that just hang around and protect you and do things?

436
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:55,511
And I'm like, this is exactly what I need.

437
00:21:55,552 --> 00:21:59,013
So I started developing a lot of ideas that just started rolling out that way

438
00:21:59,574 --> 00:22:02,555
and becoming sort of core elements.

439
00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:06,317
And then if you have a torch and you have a compass, then you've got to,

440
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:09,319
well, then I have to have a way to mess those up.

441
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:11,960
So then a room where your torch gets put out,

442
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,361
or a room that you walk into and you get spun around.

443
00:22:14,421 --> 00:22:15,802
So if you don't have the compass,

444
00:22:16,122 --> 00:22:17,203
then you're going to get lost.

445
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:19,705
Or then I thought, what about a room where your torch goes out

446
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:21,387
and you get spun around?

447
00:22:21,847 --> 00:22:23,969
And then I got hate mail over that idea.

448
00:22:26,952 --> 00:22:29,234
Anyway, every limitation in wizardry was like that.

449
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,735
How do I get beyond this?

450
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:31,876
I want to go through this wall.

451
00:22:31,896 --> 00:22:32,757
I want to teleport.

452
00:22:32,777 --> 00:22:34,478
You know, what is four spaces over?

453
00:22:34,498 --> 00:22:35,159
I want to be there.

454
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:36,720
And magic is like that.

455
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,363
Magic is a way to extend yourself in ways

456
00:22:40,423 --> 00:22:41,804
that shouldn't be possible.

457
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:48,628
It was the core of my thinking and my design, surpassing what you are, becoming something more,

458
00:22:49,248 --> 00:22:51,249
was all about my design process.

459
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:53,490
Though I wasn't really thinking too hard about it at the point.

460
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,950
It was more like, hey, what do I want to do?

461
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,111
I want to be greater.

462
00:22:56,131 --> 00:22:57,552
I want to be powerful.

463
00:22:57,672 --> 00:23:00,053
I want to be immortal and unbeatable.

464
00:23:00,453 --> 00:23:01,413
That was the idea.

465
00:23:01,693 --> 00:23:04,074
And so I wanted a game where I could be.

466
00:23:04,935 --> 00:23:06,976
and I wanted to develop a game where you could be.

467
00:23:07,116 --> 00:23:07,977
That was the idea.

468
00:23:07,997 --> 00:23:12,740
And I also had ideas about graphical complexity

469
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,301
and smooth movement and some of those things

470
00:23:14,341 --> 00:23:15,341
that were coming out of this.

471
00:23:15,782 --> 00:23:17,423
Clear differentiators from wizardry,

472
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,404
just really surpassing the limits.

473
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:24,613
and uh... uh... so after started in a play you know and uh... and started

474
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:25,534
working with brian

475
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:28,877
i realize i came to realize that seven mage classes wasn't gonna go

476
00:23:28,897 --> 00:23:32,640
that that was a little over the top and then i i had this concept also for a

477
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,140
barred

478
00:23:33,561 --> 00:23:37,063
and the reason that happened was again it was sort of this chain uh... reaction

479
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:37,624
of ideas

480
00:23:37,644 --> 00:23:41,947
i i had we had background music running in some of these video conversions when

481
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:44,429
i was at house where no and a buddy of mine larry holland

482
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:46,891
was was a musician was really good at this

483
00:23:47,452 --> 00:23:50,753
and uh... and had come up with a really good way using the screen interrupt on

484
00:23:50,793 --> 00:23:53,554
an apple because that's really the only interrupt there was an apple to was the

485
00:23:53,674 --> 00:23:54,114
screen

486
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:55,635
raster interrupt that would happen

487
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,655
and and for a tickling the uh...

488
00:23:58,135 --> 00:24:01,317
the the the speaker a little bit at on these intervals

489
00:24:01,897 --> 00:24:05,898
and causing certain tones to appear out of the speaker was really fascinating

490
00:24:05,918 --> 00:24:08,819
uh... and so coming up with a way to do that so you could have

491
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:12,581
music running in the background on an apple to which which was very rare

492
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:13,501
seeing something like that

493
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:16,683
So I thought, I definitely want that effect in Bard's Tale,

494
00:24:16,903 --> 00:24:21,266
but then I thought, well if I have music running, why not tie it to this idea of spells with a duration

495
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:25,068
and make the music itself part of, make it a spell effect,

496
00:24:25,689 --> 00:24:29,791
that it's accompanying a spell effect the same way the icons are accompanying a spell effect,

497
00:24:30,172 --> 00:24:35,935
and then maybe even making the tone of the music sound like the kind of spell that you're wanting to cast.

498
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:41,961
So, because I had a bard and he wasn't one of the seven spellcasters, it sort of obviated

499
00:24:42,001 --> 00:24:45,143
the need for all these spellcaster classes, so I ended up cutting it back.

500
00:24:45,203 --> 00:24:48,987
I can't remember if I was told to cut it back or if that was my idea, but I ended up cutting

501
00:24:49,027 --> 00:24:53,010
it back to four classes, which meant I had a ton of extra spells I didn't need, so I

502
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,612
was able to pick the ones I really wanted.

503
00:24:55,672 --> 00:25:00,075
And then the idea still, though, of mastering the four classes,

504
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:02,456
the archmage still was an idea that was in there,

505
00:25:02,716 --> 00:25:05,517
and it became sort of the central idea in Bard's Tale 2,

506
00:25:06,257 --> 00:25:11,600
and got its own spell, sort of a reward for exceeding all the limits of time and space, you know?

507
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,562
If you can get to that point, then you get even more power, sort of ultimate,

508
00:25:16,142 --> 00:25:17,323
which is what I wanted.

509
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,124
Right? It's what we all want.

510
00:25:19,804 --> 00:25:21,265
An existence without limits.

511
00:25:21,885 --> 00:25:25,147
So as the project went along, there was a lot of tension on the bard character,

512
00:25:25,468 --> 00:25:28,049
it turned out, which I wasn't expecting at first, I'm going to tell you.

513
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:32,292
But the idea of the music in the background, that was at that time,

514
00:25:32,352 --> 00:25:34,533
because it was technologically difficult for the Apple,

515
00:25:34,553 --> 00:25:37,335
it was actually easy for the Commodore 64, but difficult for the Apple,

516
00:25:37,655 --> 00:25:38,556
it was unique.

517
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:42,218
So when people saw it, it was surprising to them that it was tied to gameplay.

518
00:25:42,979 --> 00:25:48,006
But the idea to make it a central component and name the game after it was not my idea.

519
00:25:50,068 --> 00:25:52,471
Electronic Arts had kind of pushed a consultant on us

520
00:25:53,192 --> 00:25:58,319
who had a background in RPG game development, but not computer game development.

521
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:02,081
But he was sort of pushed on us with a bunch of ideas and his ideas were so horrible

522
00:26:02,681 --> 00:26:06,323
I can't even tell you and I'd like to tell you a story about it but I'm not gonna have time to get through it.

523
00:26:06,683 --> 00:26:12,707
But he did name the game, he originally named it Tales of the Scarlet Bard

524
00:26:13,047 --> 00:26:16,228
and it was just so wordy that it eventually got chopped down to Bard's Tale

525
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:18,650
and he also named the city of Skara Brae.

526
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,431
And those are the actual only two things he named in the game

527
00:26:22,151 --> 00:26:25,693
and really the only two good ideas he had, I felt, at the time and Brian felt the same way.

528
00:26:27,106 --> 00:26:31,310
There were no cursed items. I don't put cursed items in my games because I don't like cursed items.

529
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,592
I like items that do something for you.

530
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:36,274
This is a game. This is the way I look at it. I make it fun.

531
00:26:36,534 --> 00:26:40,157
Realism is only helpful to the degree that it draws you in.

532
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:43,520
If it pisses you off, then it becomes less transparent.

533
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,681
This is the way I looked at it.

534
00:26:44,981 --> 00:26:48,023
So if there's something in the games that piss you off,

535
00:26:48,203 --> 00:26:50,245
it's not that they didn't piss me off,

536
00:26:50,265 --> 00:26:51,506
otherwise I would have taken them out.

537
00:26:51,886 --> 00:26:52,866
And that's the way I look at it.

538
00:26:52,886 --> 00:26:55,668
You want to make it fun and also, you know,

539
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:57,009
to keep it transparent.

540
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:59,131
I don't want people thinking about an interface

541
00:26:59,171 --> 00:27:00,051
in a game that I'm building.

542
00:27:00,111 --> 00:27:00,912
I want them to think of,

543
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,294
I want them to see themselves in the game.

544
00:27:04,895 --> 00:27:09,938
But I want to build in limits in the game so that I can then give the player tools to surpass them.

545
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:15,181
So I make it so that once you cast spells, your spell points aren't restored while you're in the dungeon.

546
00:27:15,221 --> 00:27:17,042
You have to leave the dungeon to get them restored.

547
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,944
Just so that I can then provide a magical item.

548
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:24,650
the mage's staff that allows you to regain your spell points while you're in the dungeon.

549
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:30,217
So I'm creating boundaries and limits so that I can create a way for you to surpass them

550
00:27:30,237 --> 00:27:34,502
in the game because there's an experience that comes with that that I want people to

551
00:27:34,542 --> 00:27:34,783
have.

552
00:27:36,091 --> 00:27:40,513
And I also build the game, I build all the stuff I work on, on a familiar mythos,

553
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:44,015
which is the same thing Tolkien did when he wrote his books.

554
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:50,298
He built The Lord of the Rings on a mythos that was very familiar to the people of England of his time.

555
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:56,123
So a lot of the imagery in it really was very English, the way that he tied it in.

556
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:59,205
It wasn't some other totally different mythos, it was very familiar to them.

557
00:27:59,225 --> 00:28:02,368
And I wanted to do that also, I wanted to leverage a lot of what he did.

558
00:28:03,168 --> 00:28:08,452
And certain fantasy books that were favorites of mine at that point were formative in some

559
00:28:08,472 --> 00:28:09,853
of the ideas that I put into it.

560
00:28:10,454 --> 00:28:15,698
I don't build games on alternative religious mythos like Hindu gods because I feel like it's

561
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:23,644
It distances people from the content because that's not as familiar content for people.

562
00:28:23,984 --> 00:28:26,686
It's ideas, it's creative, but it's not a connection.

563
00:28:26,946 --> 00:28:30,589
I want to connect people to the content in some way that's familiar to them,

564
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,471
and then I surprise them with something on top of that.

565
00:28:33,491 --> 00:28:35,193
I'm looking for bridges in what I build.

566
00:28:35,233 --> 00:28:38,375
So I want to build a mythos that is familiar to people.

567
00:28:38,775 --> 00:28:45,739
when I design things. Bard's Tale 2 also include time puzzles, which were, because I wanted

568
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:50,301
something more real-time involved. If I could have kept going with all this, it would have

569
00:28:50,341 --> 00:28:57,204
ultimately become very real-time or all real-time, because I would feel like that would be more

570
00:28:57,264 --> 00:29:02,666
representative of reality. So, somehow to combine both turn-based combat, which was

571
00:29:03,507 --> 00:29:06,627
the only practical thing that way i could see the solvent at the time

572
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:09,828
with something real time was what i was trying to surreal time puzzles a real

573
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:14,409
time snares we have to actually react you can't just sit there monsters will

574
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:16,109
eventually appear and kill you

575
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:18,850
if you walk away make a sandwich or something like that

576
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:23,891
always how can this more closely simulate reality but not only to

577
00:29:24,011 --> 00:29:26,971
irritate people but in a way to draw them into

578
00:29:27,752 --> 00:29:31,100
And these kind of background processes were possible

579
00:29:31,722 --> 00:29:33,867
because I was writing in assembly language,

580
00:29:33,947 --> 00:29:35,732
unlike wizardry, which was written in Pascal.

581
00:29:36,965 --> 00:29:39,747
so i was uh... out and i was just playing barstow for i want to say

582
00:29:39,787 --> 00:29:43,410
something about that the barrows deep which is uh... is coming out later this

583
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:47,493
year and i just want to say uh... i'm really excited because i'm seeing a lot

584
00:29:47,513 --> 00:29:51,237
of the same kind of elements and what the guys are doing on this project i'm

585
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:52,698
not directly involved in the project

586
00:29:53,058 --> 00:29:56,121
i'm just a kind of experiencing at the same way all of you guys will

587
00:29:56,141 --> 00:30:00,064
uh... but at the game in the puzzle elements of the kinds of things that i

588
00:30:00,104 --> 00:30:00,584
would have seen

589
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:04,726
Bard's Tale eventually reaching if I've been working on it.

590
00:30:04,766 --> 00:30:07,067
So I'm really excited about what they're doing.

591
00:30:07,087 --> 00:30:09,348
And I'm also seeing a big connection to the Mage's Tale,

592
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:11,729
which is the VR adventure that they put together,

593
00:30:11,749 --> 00:30:15,130
which I'm going to kind of conclude the talk mentioning briefly,

594
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,471
which I really enjoy.

595
00:30:16,491 --> 00:30:19,272
And I'm seeing in these games a real continuity

596
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:21,433
between the stuff that was built originally.

597
00:30:22,733 --> 00:30:29,135
Bard's Tale 2 was built on this character idea that was my focus, the Archmage.

598
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:31,476
Really kind of the idea I had from the beginning.

599
00:30:31,516 --> 00:30:35,738
I wanted everything to be about this idea of mastering all these magics.

600
00:30:36,038 --> 00:30:39,399
Because you don't just master the magics in Bard's Tale 2, you become something more.

601
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,480
More even than an Archmage, you become the Destiny Knight in that idea.

602
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,142
This idea of assembling pieces of a wand to achieve this ultimate existence in the game.

603
00:30:51,895 --> 00:30:52,935
Here I've had all kinds of screens.

604
00:30:52,955 --> 00:30:55,396
I didn't talk about those.

605
00:30:57,117 --> 00:31:06,061
I want to debunk a couple of myths that have popped up over the years about Bard's Tale as part of this,

606
00:31:06,121 --> 00:31:07,241
because there's some things said.

607
00:31:08,322 --> 00:31:12,105
uh... rebecca heinemann has made a number of statements about uh... barge

608
00:31:12,145 --> 00:31:15,268
tail in the history of barge tail over the years i i normally i was tell you

609
00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:16,709
don't pay much attention to these things

610
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,933
but uh... they they have been appointed out to me especially recently knowing

611
00:31:20,953 --> 00:31:21,714
that i'm gonna be here

612
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:23,635
so i'm not i'm a clear up a couple things

613
00:31:24,276 --> 00:31:31,000
about that and I'll say something about Rebecca and with no offense intended about this, but

614
00:31:31,201 --> 00:31:37,725
I need to set this straight. The idea that Bard's Tale 2 was originally going to be called

615
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:40,046
the Archmage's Tale is not true.

616
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:44,489
The Destiny Knight was always the idea I had.

617
00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:46,830
It was really sort of an idea I had from the beginning.

618
00:31:47,771 --> 00:31:49,512
Even when I was working on the Bard's Tale,

619
00:31:49,792 --> 00:31:52,613
it was sort of behind the idea of Archmage.

620
00:31:52,653 --> 00:31:56,335
But the Archmage itself, the name Archmage, was never the idea.

621
00:31:56,876 --> 00:32:00,258
It was always going to be this ultimate hero class

622
00:32:00,358 --> 00:32:02,299
that emerged out of that idea.

623
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:04,920
It was always going to be the Destiny Knight.

624
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,042
There was no one that was talking to me about the design of these games

625
00:32:08,102 --> 00:32:09,603
or what I had to do or didn't have to do.

626
00:32:10,023 --> 00:32:14,027
Brian gave me pretty much carte blanche on the game concept.

627
00:32:14,487 --> 00:32:17,109
So I did what I wanted to do on it.

628
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:19,591
So if there's anything you don't like about the design of Bard's Tale 2,

629
00:32:19,652 --> 00:32:23,675
which there are a number of things that have been told to me over the years

630
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:27,158
about how incredibly difficult it was to solve certain parts of the game,

631
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:28,159
then that's just my fault.

632
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,242
And maybe, you know, a little bit because we didn't playtest it

633
00:32:31,662 --> 00:32:34,264
as extensively as we could for difficulty level.

634
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,220
uh... but it was never going to be called the archmages tale i've never

635
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,261
heard of that before when i was never discussed

636
00:32:41,401 --> 00:32:44,362
i'm also aware that i would be it's been said that

637
00:32:44,703 --> 00:32:49,004
there there was a that uh... rebecca said she had a discussion with me

638
00:32:49,604 --> 00:32:51,625
at some point back then that

639
00:32:52,245 --> 00:32:54,726
uh... and i was asked why i didn't

640
00:32:55,767 --> 00:33:01,232
add female character options into Bard's Tale and allegedly my response was

641
00:33:01,692 --> 00:33:03,814
that girls don't play these games.

642
00:33:04,474 --> 00:33:06,316
So this has been said. I was just told about this.

643
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:09,159
Okay, that conversation never happened.

644
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,442
And let me just explain to you a little bit about this.

645
00:33:21,979 --> 00:33:27,807
Rebecca was back then Bill Heineman and so Bill at that time, so I'm just speaking historically

646
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:31,691
now, Bill was a very colorful character in the office.

647
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:36,577
Bill was, he was almost like a sitcom character, you know, kind of like, I don't know if I'm

648
00:33:36,938 --> 00:33:40,719
if you guys are, most of you are older, like a latke on taxi.

649
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:41,239
You know what I mean?

650
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,839
He was a comedic kind of guy that we all liked,

651
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:46,640
but he had a kind of extreme personality.

652
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,341
And he was in the back corner, we called him Burger Bill.

653
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,281
And he would start the week out by going to McDonald's

654
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:56,242
and buying a ton of burgers and then storing them in his desk

655
00:33:56,562 --> 00:33:58,483
and just pulling them out through the week and eating them.

656
00:33:58,523 --> 00:33:59,203
It was like that.

657
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:02,445
he he he would do a lot of really peculiar things that will what made us

658
00:34:02,545 --> 00:34:03,085
laugh and

659
00:34:03,105 --> 00:34:06,727
uh... he was uh... he wasn't and my understanding from brian at the time was

660
00:34:06,767 --> 00:34:09,389
he was even put on on full-scale projects because

661
00:34:09,789 --> 00:34:11,810
he he had difficulty completing them

662
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:14,312
and would it would do what brian would call shut down

663
00:34:14,592 --> 00:34:17,594
which is sometimes when pressure was from he would just spontaneously like

664
00:34:17,654 --> 00:34:20,435
take a nap like uh... read it as best and then we sneak in

665
00:34:20,735 --> 00:34:22,837
turns monitor upside down and things like that

666
00:34:23,277 --> 00:34:24,858
uh... to kind of mess with them a little bit we are

667
00:34:25,038 --> 00:34:30,382
I really liked him, but I never had a serious conversation with Rebecca, who was at that

668
00:34:30,422 --> 00:34:33,204
time Bill, at any point when we were there.

669
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:40,268
If I'd had a conversation about female characters, I would have been messing around with him

670
00:34:40,308 --> 00:34:43,731
at the time and certainly not having a serious conversation.

671
00:34:44,371 --> 00:34:44,932
It's funny.

672
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:47,413
I was looking around and I found some artwork of mine.

673
00:34:47,854 --> 00:34:51,755
from that time frame, from a couple years actually before the Bard's Tale was done and I pulled it out.

674
00:34:52,015 --> 00:34:55,276
And you know, I have almost as many illustrations that I was drawing of women

675
00:34:55,697 --> 00:34:59,138
with swords and casting spells that I was drawing at that time as men.

676
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:04,180
So it's certainly not the case that I didn't envision women as characters

677
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,881
or as girls as playing games and wanting...

678
00:35:07,381 --> 00:35:12,502
avatars that were in the game on that level or that I was insensitive to gender issues with respect to the game.

679
00:35:12,822 --> 00:35:16,063
Gender issues are, and you know as I say this, I'm like at this moment

680
00:35:16,503 --> 00:35:21,525
I can tell you that my daughter is right now almost certainly at home playing Fortnite right now. My kids are all gamers.

681
00:35:21,925 --> 00:35:25,906
So this idea that I just don't picture that is just not true. I've never had that thought.

682
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:29,850
uh... that uh... women wouldn't be playing games like the kind of games

683
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:33,493
i've done and as i went out and eventually was would do signings and

684
00:35:33,533 --> 00:35:35,355
things that there were girls that came up

685
00:35:35,896 --> 00:35:37,578
uh... who had me autographed their games so

686
00:35:37,978 --> 00:35:41,041
i never had the experience differently and uh... i wouldn't envision it that

687
00:35:41,081 --> 00:35:43,924
way actually most of the things i work on even some of the things i'm working

688
00:35:43,984 --> 00:35:44,565
on right now

689
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:46,767
which i'll mention that briefly at the end uh...

690
00:35:47,468 --> 00:35:49,991
uh... it's true sort of gender irrelevant and that the things

691
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:53,615
i'm i'm all this i'm doing a couple i'm doing some voice interactive role

692
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:57,039
playing games for the amazon all exotherapy it's fully voice activated

693
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:58,881
free-to-play kind of things for amazon

694
00:35:59,301 --> 00:36:02,705
i just had a kids game wizard of oz that it was a finalist in an amazon

695
00:36:02,765 --> 00:36:03,385
competition

696
00:36:03,806 --> 00:36:08,291
i've done a fully interactive uh... role-playing game voice activated role

697
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:09,372
playing game of combat

698
00:36:09,772 --> 00:36:14,457
called Shadow Realm, which is also free to play on the Amazon Alexa.

699
00:36:14,777 --> 00:36:18,100
So I've been doing this sort of thing, and you know, you can play the...

700
00:36:18,741 --> 00:36:22,064
It's role-playing from any perspective. There's nothing gender-specific about it.

701
00:36:22,364 --> 00:36:23,545
So I wouldn't think in those terms.

702
00:36:23,605 --> 00:36:27,368
So this is kind of where I've come from and my background,

703
00:36:27,428 --> 00:36:29,030
and I never had that conversation.

704
00:36:30,011 --> 00:36:35,374
Another deal is the story about Brian and my falling out back in this time frame.

705
00:36:35,834 --> 00:36:40,717
Brian and I had a big falling out right about the time that Barge Tale was being completed

706
00:36:41,057 --> 00:36:42,878
into the development of Barge Tale 2.

707
00:36:43,438 --> 00:36:49,262
Brian and I never had a formal agreement for Barge Tale and what my compensation was going to be.

708
00:36:49,382 --> 00:36:51,863
I just talked to him about being partners in it. He said, sounds good.

709
00:36:52,203 --> 00:36:54,605
And I had a certain thought in my mind about what that meant.

710
00:36:54,885 --> 00:36:56,366
And he had a different thought in his mind.

711
00:36:56,686 --> 00:37:00,208
so as bar still was getting wrapped up on finally like hey i'm what's the deal

712
00:37:00,448 --> 00:37:01,508
on the money on this

713
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:05,330
and he said oh yeah yeah i'm gonna have my attorney draw something up and i'll

714
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:05,851
show it to you

715
00:37:06,231 --> 00:37:09,672
so i eventually got handed about that time in agreement and i looked at it and

716
00:37:09,732 --> 00:37:11,153
it wasn't what i was expecting

717
00:37:11,894 --> 00:37:13,615
So I thought, okay, what do I do with this?

718
00:37:13,655 --> 00:37:15,998
And I got advised to hire an attorney to do this.

719
00:37:16,078 --> 00:37:18,100
Well, my parents had an attorney for their business.

720
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,601
They were going through some legal things.

721
00:37:19,922 --> 00:37:22,104
So I got this guy to represent me in this,

722
00:37:22,564 --> 00:37:24,206
and he jumped into this.

723
00:37:24,586 --> 00:37:27,649
And from there, the entire process of negotiation

724
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,191
started going wrong, okay?

725
00:37:29,211 --> 00:37:31,173
And if you've had any experience with attorneys,

726
00:37:31,793 --> 00:37:34,714
you know that it's in their best interest for that to happen but i don't

727
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:38,595
know this i'm twenty two years old so and this guy's coming back he's meeting

728
00:37:38,635 --> 00:37:40,395
with brian's attorneys coming back in the same

729
00:37:40,635 --> 00:37:43,796
these guys are dragging this out there really being negative they're not gonna

730
00:37:43,856 --> 00:37:46,336
work with us on this you know we're gonna end up in court

731
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:48,637
uh... they're missing all their deadlines

732
00:37:49,057 --> 00:37:51,938
and i and i and i'm i'm still working on barge till two now

733
00:37:52,298 --> 00:37:55,578
and i'm talking to brian and he's like i do this is not happening

734
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:58,940
but i'm talking to my attorneys like nope nope they're lying to you so i'm

735
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,481
like what's going on here and you know brian was my friend but i'm like i am

736
00:38:02,941 --> 00:38:04,962
i'm really worried that i'm gonna get screwed

737
00:38:05,422 --> 00:38:08,803
so as time was going i was developing barstow to this thing dragged on and we

738
00:38:08,843 --> 00:38:12,985
were out of the year in back and forth on the contract but there were massive

739
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:16,686
delays were supposedly they weren't being responsive my attorneys telling me

740
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:19,547
and brian saying it's not it's not happening

741
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:22,428
so what happens is eventually we get it worked out

742
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:32,836
But apparently, I didn't turn over the source code in Bard's Tale 1 until we had the signed agreement.

743
00:38:33,556 --> 00:38:37,399
Now, I don't specifically remember that, just to be honest with you.

744
00:38:37,419 --> 00:38:40,981
I don't think it was that big a deal at the time.

745
00:38:41,421 --> 00:38:42,582
It certainly wasn't to me.

746
00:38:42,602 --> 00:38:49,326
But I can tell you that many times as a developer, I have withheld work product before I'm paid.

747
00:38:49,867 --> 00:38:52,007
And I've had to do that at different points as a developer.

748
00:38:52,027 --> 00:38:54,768
So it doesn't seem unusual that I would have done that here,

749
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:56,708
where I would have said, I'll hand it.

750
00:38:56,728 --> 00:38:59,228
Because I think they needed the source code so that they could

751
00:38:59,268 --> 00:39:00,909
start working on the PC version.

752
00:39:01,169 --> 00:39:04,349
And I was probably saying, we need to wrap this agreement up

753
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:05,090
before I turn it over.

754
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,810
I'm just guessing, because I really don't remember.

755
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,071
But that wouldn't seem strange to me if I did that, because I

756
00:39:10,091 --> 00:39:13,631
felt like I had a commitment for our

757
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:14,772
agreement to get wrapped up.

758
00:39:15,112 --> 00:39:19,413
But it wasn't the case that anybody was being extorted for something that wasn't due or

759
00:39:19,473 --> 00:39:20,293
something like that.

760
00:39:20,953 --> 00:39:25,515
It would have only been that, not like some massive negative thing.

761
00:39:26,295 --> 00:39:27,535
But I'm not sure exactly.

762
00:39:27,836 --> 00:39:29,176
But there was nothing else about it.

763
00:39:29,256 --> 00:39:30,156
And I can tell you that...

764
00:39:31,337 --> 00:39:35,179
uh... rebecca at that point was so peripheral to everything help happening

765
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:38,721
at the at the company and completely peripheral to bard's tale

766
00:39:39,122 --> 00:39:43,224
that she wouldn't have known anything about any of that except what brian

767
00:39:43,324 --> 00:39:44,425
might have mentioned

768
00:39:44,865 --> 00:39:49,008
at that point but really again at the margins of of the company and

769
00:39:49,508 --> 00:39:53,171
and and not involved in barcelo at all until i left

770
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:56,733
and then uh... and then was involved in barstow three and after that point i

771
00:39:56,793 --> 00:40:00,015
can't really say what her involvement was in the degree to which he was

772
00:40:00,055 --> 00:40:03,477
involved but she had all my source code going into barstow three so

773
00:40:03,497 --> 00:40:06,778
uh... they they're what they had a major running start at that point

774
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:12,272
anyway what happened was after this brian and my falling out i would i was

775
00:40:12,312 --> 00:40:16,093
kind of uh... you know we worked out a deal we we i don't think either was

776
00:40:16,153 --> 00:40:19,335
really like the deal we ended up with either of us was really thinking it was

777
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,095
what we expected but that's what it was

778
00:40:21,556 --> 00:40:23,276
and then at about five years later

779
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,998
i get a call from my mom and she says

780
00:40:26,798 --> 00:40:29,300
You're not going to believe what our attorney's done to us.

781
00:40:29,441 --> 00:40:30,722
And I'm like, what are you talking about?

782
00:40:31,022 --> 00:40:33,304
She says, we've been going through this two-year-long

783
00:40:33,364 --> 00:40:35,467
negotiation process with this other company.

784
00:40:35,887 --> 00:40:38,269
And our attorney's been telling us the whole way that

785
00:40:38,289 --> 00:40:41,352
they've been dragging it out, and they're acting in bad

786
00:40:41,432 --> 00:40:43,635
faith, and the other side's been telling us we're not

787
00:40:43,655 --> 00:40:44,556
doing any of this stuff.

788
00:40:44,756 --> 00:40:47,679
She goes, it turns out the attorney was lying the entire

789
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:49,320
way, like he's pathological.

790
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:55,826
And I'm like, Mom, this is the attorney that you referred me to for the whole barge tail thing.

791
00:40:56,226 --> 00:40:59,890
And she's like, Oh yeah, he's crazy. And I'm like, Oh my gosh.

792
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:05,955
So I'm like, oh, all of a sudden I'm thinking back on everything that happened and realizing this guy

793
00:41:07,376 --> 00:41:12,160
wrecked my relationship with Brian. I ended up writing a long letter to Brian at that point,

794
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:16,964
apologizing to him for this and saying, Man, I'm so sorry. I should have listened to you,

795
00:41:16,984 --> 00:41:17,725
should have trusted you.

796
00:41:18,266 --> 00:41:20,728
but this guy really had made me afraid.

797
00:41:20,828 --> 00:41:24,873
And plus I was a kid, not a good communicator myself at that point.

798
00:41:25,273 --> 00:41:27,255
So anyway, so Brian and I worked that out

799
00:41:27,315 --> 00:41:30,098
and we've had a positive relationship ever since that point

800
00:41:30,339 --> 00:41:32,441
and that resolved everything with us.

801
00:41:34,897 --> 00:41:36,818
It was okay though because the break,

802
00:41:37,058 --> 00:41:38,599
you know, I have no idea how many more titles

803
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,800
we'd have gone on and done together.

804
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,981
If that hadn't happened,

805
00:41:41,442 --> 00:41:43,623
we probably would have done quite a few more.

806
00:41:43,903 --> 00:41:46,625
But it was okay because I really wanted to go back to school

807
00:41:46,705 --> 00:41:48,026
and I was already taking class,

808
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:49,528
I transferred my units down from Berkeley,

809
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:53,290
I was already taking classes at UCI in philosophy,

810
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,531
which is what I wanted to move into.

811
00:41:54,852 --> 00:41:58,274
From designing systems to getting to the ideas

812
00:41:58,354 --> 00:42:01,416
behind the systems, the ideas that motivate human behavior.

813
00:42:01,997 --> 00:42:06,560
which led me into theology and then into a doctoral program in social ethics at USC,

814
00:42:07,021 --> 00:42:09,923
where my research and writing was on ethics and technology.

815
00:42:10,844 --> 00:42:14,367
So speaking of philosophy, let me say a couple things about philosophy,

816
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:16,488
which I've been hinting around about.

817
00:42:16,949 --> 00:42:19,370
And this is really kind of where I want to take all this for you

818
00:42:20,411 --> 00:42:22,313
in whatever my short time is left here.

819
00:42:22,653 --> 00:42:24,414
But let me draw a picture for you.

820
00:42:24,655 --> 00:42:28,718
Technology is rooted in our innate need to extend ourselves.

821
00:42:28,798 --> 00:42:30,479
That's what all technology is about.

822
00:42:30,899 --> 00:42:35,602
Our senses, our lives, our abilities to surpass limitations.

823
00:42:36,283 --> 00:42:40,085
To become something more than we are as mere physical human beings.

824
00:42:40,105 --> 00:42:43,728
That's how I view technology and the trajectory of technology.

825
00:42:43,748 --> 00:42:45,349
It compresses space-time.

826
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:48,631
It allows us to be anywhere at any time,

827
00:42:49,332 --> 00:42:51,773
to communicate with endless numbers of people,

828
00:42:52,314 --> 00:42:54,595
to remove physical distance as a limitation.

829
00:42:55,456 --> 00:42:57,817
to overcome all kinds of physical limitations.

830
00:42:57,857 --> 00:43:01,660
That's why we use technology, to see beyond our natural vision and so on.

831
00:43:02,341 --> 00:43:05,443
You can see the correspondence between magic and technology

832
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:07,525
if you think of technology in that way,

833
00:43:08,125 --> 00:43:09,266
and consider it like that.

834
00:43:09,306 --> 00:43:11,268
The idea behind them is the same,

835
00:43:11,328 --> 00:43:13,029
and it's the thing that we yearn for

836
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:15,871
as human beings to exceed our limits,

837
00:43:16,151 --> 00:43:18,273
and we build devices to make it possible.

838
00:43:19,074 --> 00:43:23,580
Almost everything I've been saying about my approach to Barge Tale goes in that direction.

839
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:27,726
And my design's always been to offer people that kind of experience.

840
00:43:28,327 --> 00:43:33,935
And I think that games and movies succeed and fail based on how well they deliver that kind of an experience.

841
00:43:34,796 --> 00:43:38,979
really, whether they allow people to have the experience of exceeding their limits,

842
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:43,063
the experiences that are intrinsic to being human.

843
00:43:44,044 --> 00:43:47,828
And this is one of them, this idea of becoming more than we are.

844
00:43:47,868 --> 00:43:50,070
It's only one, but it's an important one.

845
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:55,454
And I can explain why I think it's a universal need based on a Christian worldview.

846
00:43:56,419 --> 00:44:00,004
Now I'm not going to dive into theology, so if that doesn't sound good to you, you have

847
00:44:00,064 --> 00:44:00,585
no fear.

848
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:04,830
Nor does it matter if you share that worldview or you think it's BS.

849
00:44:05,491 --> 00:44:11,719
But there's a takeaway in this, which is interesting regardless in the process of game design and

850
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,661
what I've been telling you.

851
00:44:13,515 --> 00:44:17,256
And as we look at so many movies, and maybe games,

852
00:44:17,356 --> 00:44:19,237
I can't really say so much from that,

853
00:44:19,377 --> 00:44:22,878
about storylines that don't meet our needs, that are failing,

854
00:44:23,238 --> 00:44:25,678
that don't change our lives, that we forget almost

855
00:44:25,738 --> 00:44:27,959
the moment we walk out of the theater, we feel like, wow,

856
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:31,580
I just wasted $18 and 2 and 1 1⁄2 hours of my time.

857
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,160
There's something about all this that's

858
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,261
not obvious to designers today, whether they're game designers

859
00:44:38,401 --> 00:44:39,502
or movie designers.

860
00:44:40,902 --> 00:44:46,183
And there's been attention given to the fact that I named the cities in Bard's Tale 2 after biblical cities.

861
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:49,383
And that's come up and I've been asked about that at different points.

862
00:44:49,743 --> 00:44:53,984
Kind of runs antithetical to my design philosophy, but I want to explain that.

863
00:44:54,764 --> 00:44:58,665
As I was designing Bard's Tale 2, I came up with the main city name, Pangramain,

864
00:44:58,885 --> 00:45:01,806
and then I had all these other cities that were going to be nodes in the game,

865
00:45:01,826 --> 00:45:05,387
and I'm sitting there trying to think of names, cool names for the cities,

866
00:45:05,887 --> 00:45:07,667
only I really had other stuff to work on.

867
00:45:08,347 --> 00:45:12,730
I just started filling in the names of biblical cities that came to mind.

868
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:16,073
Because I'm thinking maybe some names of ancient cities like Scarabray,

869
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:19,015
but I don't know any except the ones that are in the New Testament.

870
00:45:19,315 --> 00:45:22,517
So I started filling in those names. I left out two really obvious cities.

871
00:45:23,419 --> 00:45:26,240
that would have been immediately recognizable and I used a bunch of the

872
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:26,620
others

873
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:30,721
and I knew someone was going, I thought someone was going to see that and point

874
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:34,162
it out and say you gotta take the Bible names out of this game

875
00:45:34,562 --> 00:45:38,403
and come up with some fictitious names for cities but it never happened.

876
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:42,784
There were just placeholder names. Nobody ever noticed. Nobody ever commented on it.

877
00:45:42,864 --> 00:45:45,285
Nobody ever said anything. I'm looking at the proofs for the

878
00:45:45,585 --> 00:45:49,046
for the map. Nobody's ever saying anything to me. I'm kind of like really?

879
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,387
Nobody knows what these names represent.

880
00:45:52,348 --> 00:45:53,409
It didn't seem like it.

881
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:57,435
Or maybe somebody did, but they thought it'd be funny to let it go by, I don't know.

882
00:45:57,976 --> 00:45:58,977
So eventually I didn't.

883
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,383
It went through and then people later on figured it out.

884
00:46:05,182 --> 00:46:09,464
And maybe like that response, not recognizing those cities,

885
00:46:09,544 --> 00:46:11,985
maybe people are oblivious to the implications

886
00:46:12,045 --> 00:46:14,926
of the Christian worldview with regard to game design,

887
00:46:15,487 --> 00:46:18,148
of people wanting to become more than they are.

888
00:46:18,388 --> 00:46:20,589
That's a central idea in the Christian worldview

889
00:46:20,629 --> 00:46:23,831
of extending ourselves, of surpassing limits,

890
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,412
of becoming immortal and unbeatable.

891
00:46:26,952 --> 00:46:29,434
This is at the core of the Christian worldview,

892
00:46:29,694 --> 00:46:31,114
to reach a destiny

893
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:33,956
beyond what most people settle for.

894
00:46:34,836 --> 00:46:39,178
Tolkien's world rested on that exact same worldview,

895
00:46:39,478 --> 00:46:42,539
same assumptions I've made when I come to design,

896
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,301
not to explicitly put things in like these names

897
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:48,362
of the cities, but the ideas behind them

898
00:46:48,802 --> 00:46:51,083
and what people want to be.

899
00:46:51,524 --> 00:46:55,106
So even if you think, you know, you don't have a clue about, you know, this Christian thing,

900
00:46:55,627 --> 00:46:59,129
his work was formative for a lot of what's happening at this conference. So,

901
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:03,593
it's worth thinking a little bit about something that was so central to his design.

902
00:47:04,173 --> 00:47:08,657
But it's this assumption, this is Tolkien's assumption, is that you're intentionally

903
00:47:08,777 --> 00:47:15,242
created, you're not an accident. If you're intentionally created, you were made to work

904
00:47:15,302 --> 00:47:16,002
a certain way.

905
00:47:17,394 --> 00:47:24,922
Like anything that's intentionally created you have a purpose and you have a certain kind of life built into you if that's true

906
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:30,768
That's what his assumption was if you live that life if you fulfill the thing

907
00:47:30,788 --> 00:47:34,371
You're made to fulfill you have an experience of fulfillment

908
00:47:34,672 --> 00:47:37,073
And if you do something different, you don't.

909
00:47:37,193 --> 00:47:39,474
You have a train wreck on some level in your life.

910
00:47:39,574 --> 00:47:40,415
That's his idea.

911
00:47:40,935 --> 00:47:46,758
So Tolkien took that and created a mythos that had nothing explicitly to do with Christianity

912
00:47:46,798 --> 00:47:52,421
but was based on those assumptions about who we are, what matters, and who we should become.

913
00:47:53,002 --> 00:47:57,144
And every bit of Lord of the Rings rests on that idea, though there's nothing explicitly

914
00:47:57,204 --> 00:47:57,384
in it.

915
00:47:58,692 --> 00:48:05,257
If you look at the storyline, the characters don't directly relate to anything in our culture.

916
00:48:05,537 --> 00:48:07,219
They don't make sense of our culture.

917
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,740
It's counter-cultural.

918
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,621
His characters are selfless.

919
00:48:11,202 --> 00:48:13,924
They are sacrificial in the way they live.

920
00:48:13,964 --> 00:48:17,266
They're not Western American individualist consumers.

921
00:48:17,546 --> 00:48:19,768
That's not the characters of Lord of the Rings.

922
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:24,471
They are people that become what they should be, or people who intentionally...

923
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:27,751
diverge from what they should be.

924
00:48:28,151 --> 00:48:31,515
That's his representation of evil in the book.

925
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:36,419
And I build games the same way, or at least that's my idea.

926
00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:38,301
Nothing explicitly Christian,

927
00:48:38,741 --> 00:48:40,403
except where I was kind of messing around

928
00:48:40,463 --> 00:48:41,804
with those city names,

929
00:48:42,164 --> 00:48:45,267
but offering people the things that the world view says

930
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:47,349
are at the center of being human.

931
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:51,212
And this idea of exceeding limits is one of those things.

932
00:48:51,673 --> 00:48:53,835
We want it because we're intended for it.

933
00:48:54,275 --> 00:48:56,057
And if you approach game design with that,

934
00:48:56,097 --> 00:48:57,958
you have a hook automatically.

935
00:48:58,118 --> 00:48:59,680
Whether you buy the worldview or not,

936
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,102
it is something that people yearn for.

937
00:49:02,462 --> 00:49:03,863
Extending our senses.

938
00:49:04,204 --> 00:49:06,125
It's what all of technology's about.

939
00:49:06,546 --> 00:49:08,227
We wanna walk through walls.

940
00:49:08,287 --> 00:49:10,669
We wanna cross infinite space

941
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:14,853
and be powerful beyond the circumstances of life.

942
00:49:15,113 --> 00:49:17,175
That's why we love superhero movies.

943
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,678
We want to be immortal and unbeatable.

944
00:49:20,158 --> 00:49:24,222
We want to be those things because we're intended

945
00:49:24,442 --> 00:49:25,784
to have those things in our life.

946
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:27,065
That's the philosophy.

947
00:49:27,526 --> 00:49:29,387
So here's the application for game design.

948
00:49:29,988 --> 00:49:35,153
You can offer that experience virtually in a game.

949
00:49:36,282 --> 00:49:40,523
just as you can, not as transparently. And by transparently I mean, with a movie theater,

950
00:49:40,563 --> 00:49:45,425
there is that, there's not as much transparency. You don't project yourself into it the same

951
00:49:45,445 --> 00:49:50,927
way that you do in a game, but you can offer it also in a movie, this experience of transcending

952
00:49:51,207 --> 00:49:57,790
your limitations. So all I did in Bard's Tale was offer that to people in every way I possibly

953
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:01,331
could. It was one of the central ideas in the whole way I was approaching it.

954
00:50:01,731 --> 00:50:06,334
and the whole ethos of the world was to deliver that kind of experience and make them fun

955
00:50:06,815 --> 00:50:08,656
and also make them hard to acquire.

956
00:50:09,697 --> 00:50:16,722
So this progress to becoming a destiny knight, something great, which is not something bizarre

957
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:22,267
or weird or sick or, you know, crazy, but something that you're supposed to be, that's

958
00:50:22,287 --> 00:50:23,308
what I want to offer in a game.

959
00:50:23,508 --> 00:50:28,652
You can offer people all kinds of unusual and bizarre things, but if you want to tap

960
00:50:28,712 --> 00:50:33,116
into this sense that people have, you want to offer them the ability to become the best

961
00:50:33,176 --> 00:50:38,821
of what they can be, this destiny, not an accident, it's something we want.

962
00:50:40,102 --> 00:50:46,029
This idea that everything's an accident, nothing matters, and you're headed nowhere, that's not going to sell copies as you build it into a game.

963
00:50:46,169 --> 00:50:53,498
Purpose, destiny, meaning, sacrifice. See, these things inspire people and pull them in.

964
00:50:53,818 --> 00:50:58,544
You know, people want to grab the balrog and drag him into the abyss.

965
00:50:59,184 --> 00:51:01,626
makes no sense of Western consumer culture,

966
00:51:01,886 --> 00:51:02,986
why would you want to do that?

967
00:51:03,387 --> 00:51:05,228
But people do want that.

968
00:51:05,368 --> 00:51:07,709
And if you give them the opportunity to do that

969
00:51:07,789 --> 00:51:09,630
in the context of a game,

970
00:51:10,791 --> 00:51:13,172
maybe you'll be up here doing a post-mortem in 30 years.

971
00:51:13,592 --> 00:51:13,832
Maybe.

972
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:21,552
Now, if you're hearing that idea, it might also be obvious that virtual reality is not

973
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:27,475
only an effective way to deliver the kind of experience I'm talking about, a transcendent

974
00:51:27,775 --> 00:51:30,416
immersive experience, but it is the thing itself.

975
00:51:30,736 --> 00:51:31,877
The medium's the message.

976
00:51:31,917 --> 00:51:33,498
That's what virtual reality is.

977
00:51:33,878 --> 00:51:35,539
It's inherently transcendent.

978
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:40,501
You inherently project yourself into the world that it creates.

979
00:51:41,282 --> 00:51:45,887
It's as transparent almost as you can get, unless you mess it up with too much stuff.

980
00:51:46,608 --> 00:51:51,053
And that's one of the ways in game design that we interfere with the transparency of the interface.

981
00:51:51,434 --> 00:51:52,916
We make it too complicated.

982
00:51:53,436 --> 00:51:57,241
The simpler it is, the more that people don't have to think about what they're doing,

983
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:58,322
the more you...

984
00:52:00,004 --> 00:52:02,785
You draw them in and commit them to what's going on in the game.

985
00:52:03,605 --> 00:52:08,106
And so VR is a technology that not only has the potential to engage people in this amazing way

986
00:52:08,206 --> 00:52:13,248
and graphically interesting way, but to touch them at the core of who they are and what they need.

987
00:52:13,648 --> 00:52:19,090
And I've been playing Mage's Tale this last, since it was released about six months ago or so.

988
00:52:19,831 --> 00:52:21,551
All the elements I'm talking about are here.

989
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:24,872
I mean, this is to me really where Bard's Tale would have ended up.

990
00:52:24,932 --> 00:52:25,873
That's the way I feel.

991
00:52:26,753 --> 00:52:32,816
If I could have made anything or done anything, I think this is the kind of a game I would have ended up at.

992
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:36,938
Seamless. This chance for me to really be the Archmage.

993
00:52:37,018 --> 00:52:39,980
Because if you're in the game, you are the Archmage.

994
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:43,201
Or at least you're taking a step in that direction as part of this game.

995
00:52:43,641 --> 00:52:45,262
I can feel the game drawing me that.

996
00:52:45,302 --> 00:52:47,904
Giving me this chance to be a hero as I'm standing there.

997
00:52:47,924 --> 00:52:51,946
Or to be afraid, you know, as goblins are running up to me, you know, in the game.

998
00:52:51,986 --> 00:52:54,647
Like I'm almost screaming the first time I'm playing the game.

999
00:52:55,527 --> 00:52:58,449
uh... sitting in my apartment all those years ago staring down wireframe

1000
00:52:58,489 --> 00:52:58,990
corridors

1001
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:01,411
you know wanting to be there and now i can

1002
00:53:06,556 --> 00:53:09,118
i've eight minutes

1003
00:53:10,279 --> 00:53:10,819
anything you want

1004
00:53:20,127 --> 00:53:23,149
uh... i'll make two questions if i can uh...

1005
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:23,990
so

1006
00:53:25,129 --> 00:53:32,294
I recall years ago using sector editors to pump up the abilities of the characters in

1007
00:53:32,314 --> 00:53:34,196
Bard's Tale and I still could not finish the game.

1008
00:53:34,896 --> 00:53:38,840
I think it was probably the first time I ever cheated in a game and we cheated because we

1009
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:39,780
couldn't do anything else.

1010
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,062
Did you guys intentionally make it that difficult?

1011
00:53:42,342 --> 00:53:47,786
No, you know, well I think I did, because I think hard games are good games, but I never

1012
00:53:47,887 --> 00:53:52,790
intended the game to be so incredibly frustrating that people were pulling their hair out.

1013
00:53:53,471 --> 00:53:57,154
But you know how it is, if you're a developer, see I'm really much more a developer than

1014
00:53:57,174 --> 00:53:57,654
I'm a gamer.

1015
00:53:59,475 --> 00:54:02,757
I play it a little bit myself, but I know what I'm doing, right? I'm playing the game.

1016
00:54:03,117 --> 00:54:08,059
And we had play testers, and I wasn't getting feedback. Like, this game's way too hard. I didn't get that feedback.

1017
00:54:08,459 --> 00:54:13,501
So if I had, I would have changed it. That's all it was, I think. If I'd gotten the feedback...

1018
00:54:13,801 --> 00:54:18,323
I think I have a tendency to make things too hard, and I need to get feedback from people.

1019
00:54:18,343 --> 00:54:21,044
And I've had that experience. So the first time I did this Alexa game, I'm thinking,

1020
00:54:21,064 --> 00:54:24,125
these puzzles are so obvious, these riddles are so obvious, people are going to guess them right away.

1021
00:54:24,626 --> 00:54:27,949
And they don't. I'm getting emails from people like, you know, what is this thing?

1022
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:30,032
And I'm having to give them clues to figure it out.

1023
00:54:30,072 --> 00:54:35,678
And I'm realizing, sometimes I think I may be jumping ahead a couple steps when I shouldn't.

1024
00:54:35,919 --> 00:54:39,363
So I think that was the problem. I think I thought this is going to be so fun for people.

1025
00:54:39,763 --> 00:54:43,888
And I made it unintentionally frustrating. And I just didn't get feedback.

1026
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:45,960
It didn't make it any less enjoyable, I'll say that.

1027
00:54:46,201 --> 00:54:48,943
I was just wondering if that was an intentional issue or not.

1028
00:54:49,144 --> 00:54:49,344
No.

1029
00:54:50,084 --> 00:54:54,769
So the other question I would ask is, based on where

1030
00:54:54,829 --> 00:54:57,212
technology is today versus where it was when you were

1031
00:54:57,232 --> 00:54:59,994
starting out, you were saying that, hey, you went to your

1032
00:55:00,034 --> 00:55:02,697
friend's house, you saw the Apple II, you were able to,

1033
00:55:02,897 --> 00:55:05,780
and you had enough time that that had a

1034
00:55:07,302 --> 00:55:12,909
you know, long enough life cycle that you could see it, discover it, spend time learning

1035
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:17,295
it and still be publishing games on it eight, nine years later. I don't think that's really

1036
00:55:17,555 --> 00:55:21,601
possible today, so what I'm wondering is from your perspective, you know, when you have

1037
00:55:21,661 --> 00:55:24,625
that, you see that opportunity or you have that idea, um...

1038
00:55:26,186 --> 00:55:28,647
What would you say you would recommend as far as like,

1039
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:31,949
how do you balance or make the decision that,

1040
00:55:32,049 --> 00:55:34,270
hey, that's the thing I'm gonna make the investment in

1041
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:36,491
in the hopes that it actually bears fruit

1042
00:55:36,551 --> 00:55:39,693
rather than, well, I'm gonna kind of sit on the fence

1043
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:43,615
and hope that when it's time to hitch my wagon to that,

1044
00:55:43,675 --> 00:55:44,895
that there's still a market there.

1045
00:55:45,155 --> 00:55:53,661
Right. Yeah, it's a difficult thing. I had this problem. I waited too long on getting into PC development and stayed with 6502 development too long.

1046
00:55:53,961 --> 00:56:00,866
Yeah, I think it's really hard. I think it's a great career move to really think what's going next and how do I get myself up to speed on that.

1047
00:56:01,206 --> 00:56:07,871
Because, yeah, if you focus on the moment right now, the level of complexity to manage the kind of systems and engines and things that are out right now.

1048
00:56:08,571 --> 00:56:10,473
I think you'll always be catch up.

1049
00:56:10,893 --> 00:56:12,554
Never have the opportunity to come up with something

1050
00:56:12,674 --> 00:56:14,215
really leading edge and creative.

1051
00:56:14,456 --> 00:56:15,937
You need to think next step.

1052
00:56:16,257 --> 00:56:18,038
To me, next step is virtual reality.

1053
00:56:18,078 --> 00:56:19,820
I have no question that that's where

1054
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:20,880
almost everything's gonna be.

1055
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,281
I think the technology's gonna be

1056
00:56:23,062 --> 00:56:24,983
just exponentially increasing in time.

1057
00:56:25,063 --> 00:56:27,085
So if it was me and I was going back

1058
00:56:27,145 --> 00:56:28,606
into this kind of game development,

1059
00:56:28,626 --> 00:56:30,127
I'd be focused on that.

1060
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:31,308
But I think you're absolutely right.

1061
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,530
You have to almost think ahead,

1062
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:36,532
like three steps ahead, or you get wiped out nowadays.

1063
00:56:37,052 --> 00:56:39,153
Completely different business nowadays than when I was in it.

1064
00:56:39,473 --> 00:56:39,954
No question.

1065
00:56:41,834 --> 00:56:42,015
Yes?

1066
00:56:42,455 --> 00:56:42,595
Hi.

1067
00:56:42,995 --> 00:56:47,037
I had a quick question as regards to the balance.

1068
00:56:47,077 --> 00:56:50,058
So earlier you were speaking about familiarity

1069
00:56:50,278 --> 00:56:53,620
of the mythos and how that is necessary.

1070
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,602
I was wondering how you feel about the balance of that

1071
00:56:58,002 --> 00:57:00,723
versus the inclusivity or exclusivity that

1072
00:57:00,783 --> 00:57:03,865
might create to the folks who are just as

1073
00:57:03,905 --> 00:57:05,645
interested in that sort of thing.

1074
00:57:05,746 --> 00:57:05,886
But.

1075
00:57:06,949 --> 00:57:12,713
primarily want that experience of being better, but it's not, it doesn't look like them, it doesn't feel like them.

1076
00:57:12,993 --> 00:57:17,877
Well, yeah, I mean, that's a good point, because I want everybody to be drawn into my game.

1077
00:57:18,217 --> 00:57:21,140
So that would definitely be a consideration for me is,

1078
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,343
yeah, am I keeping anybody from, like, feeling like I'm starting with an experience?

1079
00:57:25,363 --> 00:57:31,988
So maybe it's, it's, it's, it's, maybe it's shifting far enough away that it's not, like, identical to any one community.

1080
00:57:32,749 --> 00:57:41,035
But yeah, any sense that I'm keeping, any gender or perspective or ethnicity or community

1081
00:57:41,075 --> 00:57:45,819
or social economic bracket from enjoying my game, that would not be what I would want

1082
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:45,999
to do.

1083
00:57:46,019 --> 00:57:49,942
I don't want to connect on a level that taps into those kind of differentiators.

1084
00:57:49,982 --> 00:57:55,806
So right, so it's fantasy enough that almost anybody could project themselves into it.

1085
00:57:56,487 --> 00:58:01,431
And I can think of a couple shows and things that have accomplished that.

1086
00:58:01,472 --> 00:58:03,513
So I would be sensitive to that, absolutely.

1087
00:58:04,234 --> 00:58:04,534
Thank you.

1088
00:58:04,594 --> 00:58:04,795
Yeah.

1089
00:58:06,857 --> 00:58:07,037
Yes.

1090
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,280
What can you say about the burger Easter egg?

1091
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,661
The burger what?

1092
00:58:12,282 --> 00:58:13,583
The burger Easter egg.

1093
00:58:14,984 --> 00:58:15,985
I'm sorry, the burger...

1094
00:58:17,867 --> 00:58:18,808
Burger Easter egg?

1095
00:58:19,368 --> 00:58:20,269
I don't know what that is.

1096
00:58:20,689 --> 00:58:20,930
Okay.

1097
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:21,690
Okay.

1098
00:58:22,362 --> 00:58:22,703
Sorry.

1099
00:58:23,303 --> 00:58:27,346
In one of the temples, it generates and spawns off a whole bunch of monsters.

1100
00:58:29,187 --> 00:58:29,888
Was that in my game?

1101
00:58:31,129 --> 00:58:31,709
I don't remember.

1102
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:32,530
I'm sorry.

1103
00:58:34,471 --> 00:58:38,174
I've written 150 million lines of code since then, so forgive me.

1104
00:58:39,715 --> 00:58:39,975
Sorry.

1105
00:58:41,014 --> 00:58:44,919
Hi there, uh, yeah, first of all, thank you, because yeah, this was one of those games

1106
00:58:44,939 --> 00:58:48,704
that I felt was formative to me, but one of the things I was looking at is it feels to

1107
00:58:48,744 --> 00:58:54,170
me that there's somewhat cyclical ebb and flows over the, you know, twenty-something

1108
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:56,814
years that I've been making games and kind of watching that, and...

1109
00:58:57,314 --> 00:59:01,719
When I was young, I played this game and Ultima 4 and found that there was a vast distance

1110
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:05,624
between those two experiences and the stories they told and what's available now.

1111
00:59:05,664 --> 00:59:07,906
Do you find that it's kind of cyclical in that regard?

1112
00:59:07,947 --> 00:59:11,511
And when you look at games like that that are going into the marketplace, what are some

1113
00:59:11,531 --> 00:59:15,776
of the other themes that you thought would be interesting as those kind of come and go

1114
00:59:16,016 --> 00:59:16,997
in consumer interest?

1115
00:59:17,628 --> 00:59:19,929
Well, I can't say too much about the game industry.

1116
00:59:19,969 --> 00:59:20,729
Why am I talking into that?

1117
00:59:20,749 --> 00:59:23,230
I have a lovelier mic.

1118
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:26,010
I can't say too much about the game industry specifically,

1119
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:28,350
but I think that, like what I said,

1120
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:31,591
I think that the emphasis on graphical realism

1121
00:59:32,131 --> 00:59:36,032
has skewed game design in a certain direction

1122
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:39,913
and has drawn so much energy and interest

1123
00:59:39,953 --> 00:59:43,333
in a certain direction that I think that the elements

1124
00:59:43,373 --> 00:59:45,974
that made these games so powerful for people

1125
00:59:46,194 --> 00:59:47,254
are being neglected.

1126
00:59:47,881 --> 00:59:52,083
And a lot of people, again, don't know, like, how do I make a game interesting?

1127
00:59:52,123 --> 00:59:55,944
Let's just come up with a million things you can do in the game or something like that.

1128
00:59:56,224 --> 00:59:58,125
People aren't looking at it correctly.

1129
00:59:58,485 --> 01:00:01,446
Like, from the point, like, they should be thinking,

1130
01:00:01,506 --> 01:00:04,747
what experience do I want people to have and how do we give them that?

1131
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:12,250
rather than how do I throw more graphics in or how do I give them more content or something like that.

1132
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:14,971
It's not the amount and it's not the complexity.

1133
01:00:15,291 --> 01:00:17,432
It really is more the engagement.

1134
01:00:17,892 --> 01:00:23,014
And yeah, I think that that's just not in focus and I think it's more likely the issue nowadays.

1135
01:00:23,554 --> 01:00:28,696
And it's easy for people to make that mistake and I think that was Lucas's mistake, at least in part.

1136
01:00:30,551 --> 01:00:33,573
Uh, yep. Hi. Uh, first of all, thanks for making such a great game.

1137
01:00:33,593 --> 01:00:35,655
It sucked so many hours out of my childhood.

1138
01:00:35,675 --> 01:00:37,677
Uh, loved it. But, uh,

1139
01:00:38,598 --> 01:00:42,101
um, first of all, I didn't know that there were only male characters in Bard's Tale.

1140
01:00:42,121 --> 01:00:44,924
I didn't know a lot of my characters had female names, so, uh,

1141
01:00:45,485 --> 01:00:46,966
never knew that. Thanks for mentioning that.

1142
01:00:48,307 --> 01:00:54,734
But one thing I wanted to ask you was, what was it like back in the day when games were made by a programmer?

1143
01:00:54,974 --> 01:01:03,343
Compared to today, where we have teams around the world, and Agile, Scrum, Process Heavy, Test Development, like...

1144
01:01:03,644 --> 01:01:05,546
It was awesome. It was awesome.

1145
01:01:06,266 --> 01:01:10,751
being in sole control of the world is so awesome and fulfilling

1146
01:01:11,051 --> 01:01:13,413
and you know working with other people can be so frustrating

1147
01:01:13,853 --> 01:01:16,996
and uh... even today i'm kind of a lone wolf developer to tell you the truth

1148
01:01:17,397 --> 01:01:20,860
because uh... it i i i can get things done efficiently you know game

1149
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,763
development was efficient back then and uh... because you know

1150
01:01:24,003 --> 01:01:25,524
but there wasn't there were there's too much

1151
01:01:29,166 --> 01:01:30,768
There's too much to do nowadays.

1152
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:35,794
But back at that time, it was amazing and a great

1153
01:01:35,834 --> 01:01:36,535
experience.

1154
01:01:36,955 --> 01:01:38,257
And yeah, I'm drawing pictures.

1155
01:01:38,437 --> 01:01:40,459
I'm creating dungeon textures.

1156
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,683
And I'm coming up with the storyline.

1157
01:01:43,803 --> 01:01:44,744
And I'm writing the code.

1158
01:01:45,826 --> 01:01:47,688
envisioning what version two is going to look like.

1159
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:48,949
And it was a blast.

1160
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:50,351
It was an amazing experience.

1161
01:01:50,431 --> 01:01:52,213
So I mean, I had help on the game.

1162
01:01:52,253 --> 01:01:54,016
I don't want to make it seem like I didn't.

1163
01:01:54,056 --> 01:01:56,659
I worked with artists and sound people.

1164
01:01:57,239 --> 01:01:59,863
But it wasn't like it is today, where there are huge teams.

1165
01:01:59,983 --> 01:02:02,185
It wasn't a cinematic production like it is today.

1166
01:02:02,786 --> 01:02:07,249
So I think that's one of the other factors that might make it harder to come up with a great game today,

1167
01:02:07,709 --> 01:02:10,411
is you've got so many different people that are involved.

1168
01:02:10,892 --> 01:02:15,795
And sometimes, you know, the best ideas are sort of that solitary inspiration

1169
01:02:16,175 --> 01:02:19,518
that may not make it through, you know, just by throwing... it's like a boy band, you know.

1170
01:02:19,558 --> 01:02:23,160
You can throw a lot of people together, it doesn't necessarily mean you're gonna end up with good music.

1171
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:27,063
So sometimes it's just that one solo artist that pulls it off.

1172
01:02:28,924 --> 01:02:29,084
Yes.

1173
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:33,320
Last one, I promise.

1174
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:36,101
You spoke a lot about intentionality and the fact

1175
01:02:36,141 --> 01:02:40,524
that you made the game the way you wanted to feel.

1176
01:02:40,624 --> 01:02:42,805
And it was kind of like that sort of if we make it,

1177
01:02:42,845 --> 01:02:45,086
they will come type of experience.

1178
01:02:45,987 --> 01:02:46,727
And it is a great game.

1179
01:02:49,369 --> 01:02:54,414
I'm just wondering if you feel like with the industry becoming so big and so quickly, so rapidly,

1180
01:02:55,014 --> 01:03:00,740
if that ideology or that idea is being lost in a corporate sort of setting?

1181
01:03:01,061 --> 01:03:06,206
Or how do you, I'm just curious as to how you feel about where the direction that it is going.

1182
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:09,653
Yeah, I think big companies kill all kinds of, you know, art.

1183
01:03:09,993 --> 01:03:12,674
So I think that's entirely a factor.

1184
01:03:12,814 --> 01:03:15,075
You know, there's so much money in this industry nowadays.

1185
01:03:15,115 --> 01:03:16,616
It just, it wasn't like that before.

1186
01:03:17,176 --> 01:03:18,997
So yeah, I think the pressures and tensions

1187
01:03:19,037 --> 01:03:20,037
are very different today.

1188
01:03:20,177 --> 01:03:21,838
And I think getting a good product out.

1189
01:03:22,538 --> 01:03:24,799
and getting something that's really life-changing

1190
01:03:24,919 --> 01:03:26,439
is a bigger challenge for companies.

1191
01:03:26,479 --> 01:03:28,280
They've gotta roll titles out,

1192
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:29,740
they have to roll a certain number out,

1193
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:31,341
they need to get a certain level of sales.

1194
01:03:32,161 --> 01:03:33,982
They get there thinking that's all about marketing

1195
01:03:34,042 --> 01:03:36,222
and a lot of times it's really no,

1196
01:03:36,503 --> 01:03:38,583
it's about impacting people with your product.

1197
01:03:39,063 --> 01:03:41,724
So, you know, same with the motion picture industry.

1198
01:03:41,744 --> 01:03:43,325
You know, that's why we see so many bad movies.

1199
01:03:44,105 --> 01:03:45,706
You don't just think, you sit there and just think,

1200
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:48,787
wow, they put in so many millions of dollars and this is it?

1201
01:03:49,047 --> 01:03:50,487
You know, you think, what happened?

1202
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:58,600
But it's that, it's an agenda, it's a corporate agenda and it can make getting artistic and really wonderful product out difficult.

1203
01:03:58,924 --> 01:04:02,026
Any suggestions as to something to say to those folks?

1204
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:03,507
No, well, I mean, hopefully small indie game houses

1205
01:04:04,267 --> 01:04:06,148
have a working their way around that.

1206
01:04:06,268 --> 01:04:09,230
So I would think that'd be the solution to it.

1207
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:13,092
So hopefully that's happening.

1208
01:04:13,252 --> 01:04:15,313
My son knows a lot more about the gaming industry nowadays

1209
01:04:15,353 --> 01:04:15,853
than I do.

1210
01:04:16,334 --> 01:04:19,195
But I'm hoping that that's sort of the way

1211
01:04:19,235 --> 01:04:21,736
that all this will be righted in the future.

1212
01:04:22,037 --> 01:04:24,018
All right, hey guys, thanks for coming.
