1
00:00:04,149 --> 00:00:04,890
Thank you for coming.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,314
Do all the things, turn off cell phones, remember valuations, and let's get started.

3
00:00:10,574 --> 00:00:15,497
This is applying 3D level design skills to the 2D world of Hyper Light Drifter.

4
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:17,359
My name is Lisa Brown.

5
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,982
I'm an independent game designer at the moment, but for the purposes of this talk, my relevant

6
00:00:22,042 --> 00:00:26,585
history was as a designer for Insomniac Games and more recently my work with Heart Machine

7
00:00:26,846 --> 00:00:28,026
on the game Hyper Light Drifter.

8
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:33,437
Today I'm going to talk about the transition I made from working on large AAA 3D action

9
00:00:33,477 --> 00:00:38,965
shooters such as Resistance 3 and Sunset Overdrive to Hyper Light Drifter which is a 2D overhead

10
00:00:39,245 --> 00:00:43,731
action game and what level design processes and principles carried over between 3D and

11
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:43,771
2D.

12
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:47,996
A few quick caveats for this talk.

13
00:00:48,397 --> 00:00:50,879
The focus of this talk is going to be on action combat games.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,502
So everything I talk about will be through that lens.

15
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:58,927
Also I'm going to be showing several full‑sized maps from Hyper Light Drifter which will reveal

16
00:00:58,967 --> 00:00:59,668
secret areas.

17
00:00:59,748 --> 00:01:01,990
So if you care about that thing, be advised.

18
00:01:02,751 --> 00:01:07,376
And I also want to call out all of the example levels I give on all games I show.

19
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:09,658
There's a fair amount of collaboration involved in the level work.

20
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:14,664
So many of these works, many of these rooms show things that were touched by multiple

21
00:01:14,684 --> 00:01:18,869
designers, multiple members of the team, not just me, especially in the later polish phases.

22
00:01:19,795 --> 00:01:21,116
So with that, let's get started.

23
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:22,456
So this was the spring of 2015.

24
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,878
I had just left Insomniac to go indie, work on some of my own projects.

25
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,860
And around that time, the Heart Machine team approached me.

26
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:34,261
They were working on the indie action RPG Hyper Light Drifter and needed additional

27
00:01:34,322 --> 00:01:35,302
help with level design.

28
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:38,103
So they came to me and they asked if I would be interested.

29
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:40,024
And so I thought to myself, okay.

30
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:45,491
All my level design knowledge and skills for action games thus far has been on big 3D games.

31
00:01:45,832 --> 00:01:48,115
I've done zero level design for 2D games.

32
00:01:48,636 --> 00:01:51,500
And I have no idea if any of my experience will apply at all.

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,806
So I said, you know, yes, of course, I would love to do level design for you.

34
00:01:56,629 --> 00:02:00,651
So, they gave me their design test and I ran into a few struggles off the bat.

35
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:07,115
These screenshots show the sort of 2D overhead but also from the side perspective of HyperLite

36
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:10,337
and I started struggling with this when I was doing their test.

37
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:16,220
In fact, I was so inexperienced in making 2D maps that I ended up mocking up structures

38
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,043
in SketchUp and tilting the camera to help me figure out what that might look in this

39
00:02:21,103 --> 00:02:22,363
partial overhead view world.

40
00:02:23,464 --> 00:02:28,567
It worked out okay and once I got the hang of things, I was more easily able to lay things

41
00:02:28,687 --> 00:02:29,747
out for the test.

42
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:33,410
And I ended up with a map that I thought was pretty okay and the team liked what I did

43
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,191
so they brought me aboard.

44
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:37,412
However, I was still worried a lot.

45
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:40,575
about how a lot of my level design staples

46
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:42,977
wouldn't translate from 3D.

47
00:02:43,437 --> 00:02:44,939
These were the sorts of design habits

48
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,560
that by now were second nature to me,

49
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:48,983
and I knew they wouldn't be applying in the same way.

50
00:02:49,864 --> 00:02:51,425
One fear, of course, was that I was very used

51
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:53,427
to dealing with an outward facing camera

52
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,449
and thinking about things in z-space,

53
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:56,770
especially with things like.

54
00:02:57,491 --> 00:03:00,493
using distant landmarks to help player navigate through a large space,

55
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:04,617
which of course landmarks don't work like that in an overhead game, so that wouldn't apply.

56
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:10,803
Also, all of my experience setting up combat spaces was from this perspective of a forward-facing cone.

57
00:03:11,343 --> 00:03:16,408
So everything I knew about establishing front lines or mitigating player awareness about what they couldn't see

58
00:03:16,648 --> 00:03:19,270
wasn't necessarily going to be useful in this case.

59
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:24,835
I also tended to rely a lot on verticality and spaces in 3D to make things interesting.

60
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:27,157
But this was limited in the engine for Hyperlite.

61
00:03:27,177 --> 00:03:30,840
There was no way to make it possible to walk both under and over the same space.

62
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,764
So a lot of the sneaky sort of wraparound things I had done in my design test wouldn't

63
00:03:35,784 --> 00:03:37,926
even be possible because of the engine constraints.

64
00:03:39,007 --> 00:03:40,467
So those were my big fears going in.

65
00:03:41,027 --> 00:03:43,428
But after I got started building some levels for the game,

66
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:46,168
I realized there was still a lot of transferable skill

67
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,669
going on from 3D to 2D.

68
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,809
And ultimately, I ended up finding many, many parallels.

69
00:03:50,869 --> 00:03:51,850
But for the sake of this talk,

70
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,370
I picked three big ones that I'm gonna talk about.

71
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,731
So the first thing that carried over

72
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:59,391
was my personal initial construction process.

73
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:01,552
And what I mean by that is what I do

74
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:03,752
when I start work on a brand new level from scratch

75
00:04:03,812 --> 00:04:05,553
with nothing but an empty scene before me.

76
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:10,915
I'm mainly going to talk about my process of using established metrics as constraints

77
00:04:11,015 --> 00:04:12,996
for the very first parts of building a new level.

78
00:04:13,976 --> 00:04:18,438
So many designers I know when they're working on a new level, they sort of approach it like

79
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,019
you would a subtractive sculpture.

80
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:24,741
They block out big general shapes first and then go back over and shape those big blocks

81
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:26,182
down into more detailed spaces.

82
00:04:26,622 --> 00:04:30,924
And I know a lot of level designers who work this way, but for whatever reason, I don't

83
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,946
tend to use that approach beyond a very rough suggestion of what a layout might look at.

84
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:40,712
And so my process is when starting a new level from scratch, I'll start laying out objects

85
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:45,657
according to established distances that we've already figured out for the game and then

86
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:49,020
growing the level outwards from those attached pieces.

87
00:04:49,741 --> 00:04:54,986
So then those shapes end up driving the bigger, more general shape of the whole level.

88
00:04:56,247 --> 00:05:00,910
And by metrics, I mean things like, you know, what's the minimum width of a corridor for

89
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,550
an enemy to be able to navigate through it?

90
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,532
Or what is the jump height and what is the jump distance and things like that.

91
00:05:06,632 --> 00:05:08,313
That's what I'm talking about when I say metrics.

92
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:11,458
Here is an example from Sunset Overdrive.

93
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:16,521
If you haven't played it, Sunset Overdrive is a very fast‑paced open‑world 3D shooter

94
00:05:17,002 --> 00:05:22,485
with a focus on traversal, so things like rail grinding, wall running, bouncing on things,

95
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:22,905
et cetera.

96
00:05:23,786 --> 00:05:28,209
And this example is from a moment very early on in production where we had just decided

97
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:31,831
that we were going to integrate combat with the player's move set.

98
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:36,675
Before they were very separate and the combat was much more like a traditional 3D shooter.

99
00:05:37,515 --> 00:05:38,956
but we decided we were going to combine them.

100
00:05:39,396 --> 00:05:41,637
And all the designers were tasked with prototyping

101
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:44,778
some spaces to figure out what that would feel like

102
00:05:44,798 --> 00:05:47,019
and what impact it would have on level design.

103
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:51,180
So I ended up making this sort of food court prototype.

104
00:05:51,441 --> 00:05:53,441
It's very rough and focused on mechanics.

105
00:05:54,102 --> 00:05:55,762
And when I had sort of a rough idea,

106
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:58,143
I wanted to do something with multiple heights

107
00:05:58,643 --> 00:06:00,904
that sort of spirals around some central feature.

108
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:03,886
And specifically I was trying to make a space

109
00:06:03,966 --> 00:06:05,886
that would work in multiplayer.

110
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:09,448
So let me walk you through my metrics as constraints process,

111
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:12,330
what that looks like when I was building this.

112
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,132
So I would start out with, say, a traversal piece,

113
00:06:15,192 --> 00:06:17,133
this bouncy awning the player can bounce on.

114
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:20,215
And I'm thinking, OK, if the player bounced off of this,

115
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:22,856
what's the range, like where they could land?

116
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:26,561
And somewhere in this ring, so I'm going to put another bouncy object there.

117
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:31,548
And I want a few options for the player, so I'll paste a couple of them, but I need to

118
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:34,231
make sure they're at the right width so enemies can run through them.

119
00:06:34,732 --> 00:06:35,833
So now I have a couple more.

120
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:36,294
Okay.

121
00:06:36,655 --> 00:06:39,498
You know, what's the next range of ‑‑

122
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,801
where the player can land.

123
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:46,182
I want to put more stuff there, but I don't want things to be too flat.

124
00:06:46,242 --> 00:06:48,464
So let's elevate a little bit.

125
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:51,145
What's the standard stair height?

126
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:51,845
Okay.

127
00:06:51,865 --> 00:06:52,526
We'll put those in.

128
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:56,608
You know, make sure there's more traversal options right in that area.

129
00:06:57,408 --> 00:07:02,251
And then again, I want to link this up with something else and here's the range and here's

130
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:05,633
the width it has to be for enemies to navigate and so on and so forth.

131
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:12,017
So it ended up sort of just like branching out paths from one traversal element to another.

132
00:07:12,998 --> 00:07:17,885
And as I mentioned, in this way, this construction method is a bit like a branching tree traversal

133
00:07:18,486 --> 00:07:23,674
in how small additions of connected spaces end up shaping the whole general space rather

134
00:07:23,714 --> 00:07:27,219
than the inverse method of starting with big general blocks and carving them down.

135
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:32,972
So this metrics‑driven process for me ended up coming to play on HyperLite immediately

136
00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:37,535
with the first room the team had me build. So for context, they had been building out

137
00:07:37,575 --> 00:07:42,259
the east region, which is the water region in the game. They wanted something to contrast

138
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:47,563
a lot of the tight, linear underground combat spaces they were making. So they said make

139
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:53,087
a huge room that has multiple paths you can take through it and that features this particular

140
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:53,848
new enemy.

141
00:07:54,929 --> 00:07:59,670
So I'm going to talk about this room called Mega Huge Lab, which you can see in its final

142
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,290
form here.

143
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:05,432
And for reference of how mega huge this room is, this rectangle here is the player's viewport.

144
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:07,473
So this is how much they can see on screen at once.

145
00:08:08,133 --> 00:08:11,154
So it's quite big compared to a lot of rooms in the game.

146
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:15,156
But before it made it to that state, it had humble beginnings here.

147
00:08:15,976 --> 00:08:18,277
Actually, technically it had even more humble beginnings.

148
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:23,860
It was a super rough sketch to have a relative idea of some different connected spaces I want to do.

149
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,122
But we're going to start here because this is where that carryover from my insomniac process started to come in.

150
00:08:29,202 --> 00:08:33,724
When I was faced with a blank room and had a vague idea of sort of what I wanted for the space.

151
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:38,548
I found myself falling back on the same process that I did with that Sunset Overdrive prototype,

152
00:08:38,688 --> 00:08:43,733
which was start laying things out at distances that were already defined by existing metrics

153
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,035
in the game and see how they connected.

154
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:51,360
So in this case, the main metrics in question were the drifter's dash distance, like how

155
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,902
far, like maximum, you could get across a gap.

156
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,564
There were some fixed stair dimensions

157
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:57,945
that had already been established

158
00:08:57,985 --> 00:09:00,407
that I used for distinguishing vertical layers.

159
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,449
And then of course, just the viewport size for the player.

160
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,672
That ended up being the most useful constraint

161
00:09:06,832 --> 00:09:07,412
when building.

162
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:10,094
So similar to the Sunset prototype,

163
00:09:10,475 --> 00:09:14,298
I started out by laying out blocks of the viewport size

164
00:09:14,378 --> 00:09:17,600
to get an idea of how much would be on screen in each chunk.

165
00:09:17,981 --> 00:09:19,922
And it just sort of connected out

166
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:21,083
as I was building it apart.

167
00:09:21,904 --> 00:09:25,308
And when laying out a section like this, which, you know, this is very early and went through

168
00:09:25,348 --> 00:09:31,016
many iterations later, but just to get something started to iterate on, you know, I would start

169
00:09:31,056 --> 00:09:35,682
with the drifter over here and measure what's his max dash distance here and here and just

170
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:36,423
branch out.

171
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:42,140
So if you're curious, this is what the evolution of that room looked like over time.

172
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:48,483
It went through a number of iterations, driven by some enemy changes, a couple of hazard

173
00:09:48,523 --> 00:09:54,246
changes, but ultimately that rough initial connected structure, you know, still retained

174
00:09:54,446 --> 00:09:55,386
even in the final version.

175
00:09:56,903 --> 00:10:00,984
Alright, so even though that's a sort of specific thing to my personal work style, the basic

176
00:10:01,024 --> 00:10:06,246
steps and principles of how do I just initially get started constructing carried over quite

177
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,266
well even though there were a lot of differences between 2D and 3D.

178
00:10:10,307 --> 00:10:15,208
So the second thing that carried over was this idea of using player defense and survival

179
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:18,709
instincts to shape how I approach making the level.

180
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:23,810
When I was at Insomniac, I worked under designer Drew Murray, and I remember him once saying

181
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,510
this quote to me.

182
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:30,054
Defensive capability of the player and shooters is more important to level design than offensive

183
00:10:30,094 --> 00:10:30,494
power.

184
00:10:31,094 --> 00:10:32,015
Which is very interesting.

185
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:35,177
I had not considered that when I was a young fledgling designer.

186
00:10:35,558 --> 00:10:39,360
So in other words, how a player survives and how they feel about survival has a really

187
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,642
big influence on how you build the level.

188
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:44,844
Sometimes even more so than like enemy or weapon design.

189
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:48,387
And this is things like, does your game have a health regen system?

190
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:50,248
Do you have an explicit cover system?

191
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:55,430
Basically, when the player is about to die, what mechanically do you expect them to do?

192
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,550
And it has a huge effect on how you shape the space.

193
00:11:00,171 --> 00:11:04,612
So sunset overdrive was kind of weird because in this game, the more you were moving, the

194
00:11:04,672 --> 00:11:05,472
safer you were.

195
00:11:05,512 --> 00:11:10,553
You survived by traversing and going as fast as possible through all these chain traversals.

196
00:11:10,673 --> 00:11:14,574
And as a result, the level design doesn't have a lot of those traditional places of

197
00:11:14,634 --> 00:11:18,815
safety that the player might hide in that you might see in a more traditional third

198
00:11:18,835 --> 00:11:19,415
person shooter.

199
00:11:20,289 --> 00:11:21,971
But Resistance 3 and Hyper Light Drifter

200
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:23,652
have more similar defensive models.

201
00:11:23,672 --> 00:11:24,954
So there's no regenerating health,

202
00:11:25,674 --> 00:11:27,416
and the things you have to do to replenish health

203
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:29,918
tend to be pretty risky, be that run out

204
00:11:30,038 --> 00:11:32,080
and grab a pickup in a dangerous situation,

205
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:35,644
or using those stocked health syringes in Hyper Light.

206
00:11:36,024 --> 00:11:37,566
And thematically, the world in both

207
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:39,848
is meant to feel dangerous as a whole.

208
00:11:40,268 --> 00:11:42,150
So there were some elements of the level design

209
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:44,052
that were similar as a result of that.

210
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:48,895
So as a brief aside, a lot of the terminology I'm pulling from this section is from the

211
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:52,698
book An Architectural Approach to Level Design by Christopher Totten, who I believe is in

212
00:11:52,738 --> 00:11:53,419
the room somewhere.

213
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:55,541
There he is, right there in the middle.

214
00:11:56,321 --> 00:12:02,186
This book does a great job of generalizing a lot of level design principles so they apply

215
00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:03,227
across many genres.

216
00:12:03,527 --> 00:12:07,610
And there was a section in the book called Emotional Level Design Through Survival Instinct.

217
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,632
And as I was reading it, I realized it was giving terminology to things that I'd been

218
00:12:11,672 --> 00:12:14,453
doing many years just from intuition or experience.

219
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:16,595
So it was great to have those terms.

220
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:20,636
One of these things is this idea of prospect and refuge space.

221
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:26,319
So to quickly paraphrase, this boils down to prospect space is being vulnerable out

222
00:12:26,359 --> 00:12:28,920
in the open versus feeling safe in a hidey hole.

223
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,101
And that's just the general gist of it.

224
00:12:31,802 --> 00:12:35,924
In a lot of situations in action games, you'll see these patterns where you'll have someone

225
00:12:35,944 --> 00:12:42,386
in a safe space have to go out in danger to get to a secondary refuge space further out.

226
00:12:42,406 --> 00:12:48,109
I really like this generalization because it's a principle that can apply broadly regardless

227
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,870
of the camera, whether it's 3D or 2D.

228
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:56,473
It's just a way of giving terminology to a natural habit of mine in level design.

229
00:12:57,273 --> 00:13:02,556
So like in Resistance 3, contrasting spaces of danger and safety were a frequent pattern.

230
00:13:02,896 --> 00:13:08,900
So you would often seek cover in these edge spaces that were concealed and often next

231
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:15,263
to very open, tall ceiling spaces and this was a very common way of representing refuge

232
00:13:15,303 --> 00:13:16,504
versus prospect space.

233
00:13:16,524 --> 00:13:18,665
This is a safe space and this is where the danger is.

234
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,722
And one thing I want to point out is the player feeling

235
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,344
really comes across in the relation

236
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:24,506
of these spaces to each other.

237
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:27,329
So if you are crawling through a vent

238
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:29,912
with a very low ceiling and not a lot of maneuverability,

239
00:13:30,413 --> 00:13:33,156
this in and of itself does not necessarily convey safety,

240
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:36,500
especially because if there were combat in this space,

241
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,521
it would be very dangerous.

242
00:13:38,322 --> 00:13:42,864
But if you're in that same vent that is adjacent to an open combat space and you have the high

243
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,665
ground, it feels very safe.

244
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:45,926
The enemies aren't aware of you.

245
00:13:46,006 --> 00:13:50,808
It gives you a good vantage point of how to approach the combat and it's just a very safe

246
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:54,170
feeling compared to that's where the danger is, here's where the safety is.

247
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:59,212
And then of course once the combat starts, it's no longer safe to stay up there and player

248
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:00,973
gets driven out into the prospect space.

249
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:06,477
So when making spaces for Hyper Light, I found I was relying on the same principle of appealing

250
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:10,918
to that survival instinct when creating combat spaces, even if the methods were quite different

251
00:14:10,978 --> 00:14:12,099
between 3D and 2D.

252
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:16,920
For example, I didn't have ceiling height as a tool to differentiate prospect and refuge

253
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,582
space, but I also found that it was more simple to create a feeling of the player being safely

254
00:14:22,642 --> 00:14:23,303
enclosed.

255
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:25,286
So here's an example.

256
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:29,630
There's a little refuge space after a haul of these crushed blocks that you have to dodge.

257
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:34,634
And it's just a little moment of safety before you have to go back out and deal with this

258
00:14:34,694 --> 00:14:35,895
turret up in the corner there.

259
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:40,640
And it's really only conveyed by how it's blocked in and how you have to go down and

260
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:43,162
around to move out rather than going straight through.

261
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,705
It just makes it feel more enclosed and safe.

262
00:14:47,002 --> 00:14:49,783
And as I mentioned earlier, I did find that in this 2D

263
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:52,444
overhead view, it was a lot simpler to make the player

264
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,405
feel enclosed and safe with relatively minimal

265
00:14:55,465 --> 00:14:56,845
construction compared to 3D.

266
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:59,286
And I think that's because you don't have to worry

267
00:14:59,326 --> 00:15:02,067
about conveying safe space that's outside the feel of

268
00:15:02,127 --> 00:15:03,668
vision like you do in a 3D game.

269
00:15:04,368 --> 00:15:07,209
And that sort of thing often requires some exaggeration

270
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:10,830
to point out the surrounding space that you can't see.

271
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,531
You didn't have that problem to solve in an overhead view.

272
00:15:16,013 --> 00:15:19,574
Also, I want to make it really clear that this isn't just about cover.

273
00:15:20,154 --> 00:15:24,155
So here's that same area, but on the right I removed the pillars that reach into the

274
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:25,995
frame and the little block on the bottom.

275
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:31,537
And even though they both have the same technical safety because of the range from the big bad

276
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:33,797
bird up there, they feel a little different.

277
00:15:33,837 --> 00:15:38,319
The more open one feels slightly more connected to the combat space and more dangerous as

278
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:38,819
a result.

279
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:44,460
So you don't have to do much in this view to just make the player feel enclosed.

280
00:15:45,618 --> 00:15:50,019
So even though the technical implementation was different between 2D and 3D, this idea

281
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:54,700
of building prospect and refuge spaces to sort of hone in on that survival instinct

282
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,341
still came into play in both contexts.

283
00:15:58,401 --> 00:16:03,642
Last thing that I think carried over quite well is how I used the space to control combat

284
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:04,042
pacing.

285
00:16:04,222 --> 00:16:08,664
And by this I mean a lot of the level design strategies that I used in the 3D games to

286
00:16:08,724 --> 00:16:12,585
pace out individual combat moments were still applicable in this 2D game.

287
00:16:13,645 --> 00:16:17,407
One of the big ways you can do that is finding ways to isolate combat moments.

288
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:21,168
So this is a pacing chart from Resistance 3.

289
00:16:21,929 --> 00:16:27,391
And in this case, isolating meant physically distancing when combats happen throughout

290
00:16:27,431 --> 00:16:30,393
a level to achieve like a level‑wide sense of pacing.

291
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:35,515
It can also mean just like physically enclosing a combat area from surrounding areas.

292
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:41,037
It can also mean isolating in terms of time, so things like controlling waves, spawning

293
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:45,919
in the middle of a fight, just to get a particular pacing for the individual encounter.

294
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:52,621
One thing I want to mention is you can isolate combat space without that meaning like walling

295
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:55,022
in an enclosed combat arena in a linear sequence.

296
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:58,023
Sunset Overdrive took place in an open world.

297
00:16:58,363 --> 00:16:59,143
It's a big city.

298
00:16:59,183 --> 00:16:59,923
It's fairly dense.

299
00:17:00,543 --> 00:17:04,285
But the combat spaces were still built as distinct isolated spaces.

300
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:07,267
You could access them from multiple places,

301
00:17:07,407 --> 00:17:09,128
but they were still constructed in a way

302
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:11,570
that separated them from the surrounding area

303
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:15,033
and really sold it as this is a self-contained space

304
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,775
that sort of focuses inward

305
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,877
on how the combat plays out in that space.

306
00:17:19,557 --> 00:17:22,059
And there's a couple of these throughout the game,

307
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,641
but you can sort of spot them when you go through.

308
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:27,504
They just feel a little more encapsulated

309
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:28,585
from the immediate space.

310
00:17:28,805 --> 00:17:30,827
So you know very distinctly

311
00:17:30,887 --> 00:17:32,768
when you are no longer in the combat space.

312
00:17:34,218 --> 00:17:38,121
In Hyper Light Drifter, one way we isolated combat was through the use of camera locks.

313
00:17:38,842 --> 00:17:40,984
For example, here's a space in the south.

314
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:42,565
You enter from the top.

315
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:45,627
The main fight carries you through that combat space on the right.

316
00:17:46,028 --> 00:17:47,569
There's a secret over there on the left.

317
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,551
But we used camera locks.

318
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:52,253
You can see this in the red square space there.

319
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:57,216
and so it locks the camera there and part of that is to keep them from seeing the secret

320
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:01,658
over on the left, but it also focuses the player on the combat and really makes that

321
00:18:01,698 --> 00:18:06,781
feel like an isolated moment. It ends up looking like this where the camera is locked horizontally

322
00:18:06,801 --> 00:18:11,864
and it just sort of like encapsulates this is its own distinct combat moment. And we

323
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:16,106
did this sort of camera work all over the game. It ended up being a really, really important

324
00:18:16,146 --> 00:18:18,788
tool to pacing throughout the entire game.

325
00:18:20,149 --> 00:18:24,932
Another way I often use space to control combat pacing in my 3D games refers back to that

326
00:18:24,992 --> 00:18:30,855
previous section, which is this idea of denying refuge space in order to ratchet up tension

327
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:32,056
for that particular moment.

328
00:18:32,516 --> 00:18:37,920
So I often did this by introducing enemy access to a space that was normally a safe cover

329
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,260
space.

330
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,482
In Hyper Light, one thing we did was have these sort of trap arenas, so you would enter

331
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:46,783
into a space and you would get blocked in by blocks.

332
00:18:47,843 --> 00:18:52,885
That meant you had to fight with no access to any refuge space, and it ended up being

333
00:18:52,905 --> 00:18:58,187
a really good tool for adding tense punctuation moments to combat without needing to vary

334
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:00,268
enemy composition or anything like that too much.

335
00:19:00,548 --> 00:19:04,029
It was a really quick tool for getting that intense moment.

336
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:09,214
Another example, there's this one room where you have to go out on a raised platform.

337
00:19:09,254 --> 00:19:09,954
There's no walls.

338
00:19:09,994 --> 00:19:10,775
There's no cover.

339
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:14,098
You fight flying enemies and the ground shifts underneath you.

340
00:19:14,118 --> 00:19:19,143
And this lack of access to any refuge space at all helped really sell this area as a sort

341
00:19:19,163 --> 00:19:22,106
of final challenge after a series of connected rooms.

342
00:19:22,607 --> 00:19:24,689
So it's great for punctuation marks like that.

343
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,130
And again, like the previous one,

344
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,352
even though implementation was different in both cases,

345
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:32,713
the principles behind my use of space

346
00:19:32,893 --> 00:19:35,094
to controlling combat spacing was really something

347
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:37,655
that came naturally into play in both contexts.

348
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:42,569
So briefly, I want to mention again that there were actually many more things that carried

349
00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:46,709
over nicely from my 3D experience to the 2D level design.

350
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:51,770
And I want to call out this book again for once again giving terminologies to things

351
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:55,091
that I had been doing as a designer for years and years based on intuition.

352
00:19:55,771 --> 00:20:00,192
One of its strengths is how it's able to generalize level design principles and show how they

353
00:20:00,212 --> 00:20:03,133
can apply in many different genres and viewports.

354
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:08,494
So there will be bonus slides after GDC for all the things I had to cut.

355
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,303
To wrap up, I'm going to go through a walk‑through example of a Hyperlite Drifter room from start

356
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:20,406
to finish and talk about how each of these principles and processes carried over and

357
00:20:20,446 --> 00:20:22,267
came into play when we were building this room.

358
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,370
This is the room I'll talk about.

359
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,291
It's a room in the north region of the game

360
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,712
where you're fighting cultist birds

361
00:20:29,092 --> 00:20:31,153
and it's one of a series of linked

362
00:20:31,173 --> 00:20:34,354
to underground combat rooms in the north.

363
00:20:35,055 --> 00:20:37,196
Here's a quick time lapse of how this room

364
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,396
developed over time.

365
00:20:39,276 --> 00:20:41,717
Just to note that my examples won't necessarily

366
00:20:41,757 --> 00:20:44,679
be in chronological order, but just so you get a feel

367
00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:47,920
for how it's shaped over many iterations.

368
00:20:49,537 --> 00:20:54,280
Here are the goals I was given when tasked with building this and similar rooms in the

369
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,560
North.

370
00:20:55,260 --> 00:21:00,963
We were trying to figure out what environments the North enemies worked best in and experiment

371
00:21:00,983 --> 00:21:01,323
with there.

372
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:04,804
We were experimenting with different combinations of North enemies.

373
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:11,047
In this case I was mostly focusing on these short range powerful combat cultist birds

374
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:14,209
but also brought into play this little rifle Dirk here.

375
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:18,171
He's a relatively weak but long range enemy and I wanted to play a little bit with that.

376
00:21:19,091 --> 00:21:22,839
And then for these rooms I was also supposed to keep them fairly tight and focused more

377
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,263
or less on one idea at a time.

378
00:21:24,704 --> 00:21:26,728
So no mega huge labs here.

379
00:21:28,065 --> 00:21:32,027
So this was sort of the process. After coming up with a really rough idea of what I wanted

380
00:21:32,047 --> 00:21:37,049
to try, I started with those metrics similar as I had in the other level from earlier.

381
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:43,311
I blocked out two screens worth of space for the two main beats of the room, tried to keep

382
00:21:43,351 --> 00:21:47,652
it small and tight. And this was nice because it naturally made a little corner space over

383
00:21:47,712 --> 00:21:49,833
here that was a good place to stash a secret.

384
00:21:50,634 --> 00:21:56,158
Then at the room entrance, I started out by laying out several platforms at the maximum

385
00:21:56,198 --> 00:22:01,542
dash distance from each other to see what I would need to sell as these are precarious

386
00:22:01,602 --> 00:22:02,823
cliffs on the edge there.

387
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:07,867
And that sort of showed me, okay, that takes up most of that first square.

388
00:22:08,347 --> 00:22:10,709
So the primary combat is going to happen up here.

389
00:22:10,949 --> 00:22:14,932
I'll have a little combat down there, just a little flavor combat.

390
00:22:15,012 --> 00:22:16,333
But the big fight is going to be up here.

391
00:22:18,515 --> 00:22:22,976
So, in that first pass of all these rooms, you know, I was keeping them really tight

392
00:22:23,036 --> 00:22:24,337
just to focus on the combat.

393
00:22:24,877 --> 00:22:29,899
But even in this first pass, I was still starting with the player in a safe place.

394
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:31,959
It was a disconnected platform.

395
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:33,120
It's out of line of sight.

396
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,401
And it didn't really convey safety too much.

397
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,402
But once we decided we liked the combat here, we're going to keep this room.

398
00:22:40,182 --> 00:22:43,444
One of the first things we did was expand the opening of that refuge space.

399
00:22:43,944 --> 00:22:49,006
So now there's like a little opening alcove to the left and through some iteration we

400
00:22:49,046 --> 00:22:53,548
made this little section right before you get to the first enemies feel much more tight

401
00:22:53,668 --> 00:22:56,709
and closed off and a lot safer before you get out into the open.

402
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:00,431
Eventually this opening ALCO got expanded.

403
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:07,953
You know, it had this drop floor moment and this like elaborate entrance, but in the end

404
00:23:08,533 --> 00:23:12,575
this little space right before you got to remained with that really tight blocking that

405
00:23:12,595 --> 00:23:14,035
we tried in earlier iterations.

406
00:23:15,376 --> 00:23:18,897
So now I'm going to talk about this combat moment up here and a few things I did to make

407
00:23:18,937 --> 00:23:22,158
it punchier and feel more like a peak in the room's interest curve.

408
00:23:24,047 --> 00:23:27,549
On the front of isolating combat, when you enter this section, we do a camera lock on

409
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:27,669
it.

410
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:32,390
And it's in order to really focus your attention on this fight and highlight that it's a more

411
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,852
significant combat moment than those first two birds that you just dealt with.

412
00:23:36,272 --> 00:23:39,653
And it also conveniently, like, hides the secret over in the corner.

413
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:45,395
At the same time, we're also denying access to any refuge space because you get up on

414
00:23:45,415 --> 00:23:47,196
this platform and we wall you back in.

415
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:49,296
In practice it looks like this.

416
00:23:49,836 --> 00:23:51,697
As soon as you get up there, you get closed in.

417
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:56,298
The camera lock, it clicks into play and it's like, okay, now I have to really be on my

418
00:23:56,318 --> 00:23:56,738
game here.

419
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:57,458
There's no cover.

420
00:23:58,018 --> 00:23:59,518
And it's a more dangerous scenario.

421
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,099
You're forced to react more quickly.

422
00:24:02,459 --> 00:24:05,780
In an early version of this level, I had the right side of the gap completely open.

423
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,581
So you were also having to deal with dodging the long‑range attacks of the rifle derks.

424
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:15,542
while fighting the close range cult birds. It ended up being too much going on at once. It

425
00:24:15,582 --> 00:24:21,403
was a little bit sloppy. So we isolated that part as another pacing beat. So you can see

426
00:24:21,423 --> 00:24:28,045
there's more combat to come. But, you know, we isolated it from this main part and opened it

427
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:33,606
up partway through. So it just sort of eases out of the climax nicely. It means there's a

428
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:38,487
new threat to deal with, you know, the long range guy, but it's not like too intense and it

429
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:40,668
just eases out super nice.

430
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:46,173
All right, so hopefully that walkthrough gave you some context for how I was applying some

431
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:46,673
of these things.

432
00:24:47,794 --> 00:24:50,797
Many of them are connected and support one another, but the point is that these level

433
00:24:50,817 --> 00:24:55,742
design muscles that I had built up doing 3D work still definitely applied in my workflow

434
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:59,245
for the 2D stuff and how I constructed space and how I made decisions.

435
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:01,227
So, conclusion.

436
00:25:02,188 --> 00:25:05,630
The fears I had going into this project proved to be unfounded.

437
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:10,513
Yes, there were a lot of specific methods that didn't necessarily translate, like anything

438
00:25:10,553 --> 00:25:15,577
relying on ZSpaceView or my considerations of spatial awareness had to change or even

439
00:25:15,637 --> 00:25:19,560
stuff like using those, you know, close ceiling heights to make the player feel enclosed.

440
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,622
But the more generalized processes and principles that I referred to when designing the levels

441
00:25:25,282 --> 00:25:26,963
very much applied to both contexts.

442
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:31,305
My intuitions I built up making 3D games still worked and applied.

443
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:35,587
And once again, these are but a small sample of the things that carried over.

444
00:25:35,607 --> 00:25:37,748
There's actually a lot that was generally applicable.

445
00:25:38,508 --> 00:25:40,349
And again, I'm going to recommend this book if you haven't read it.

446
00:25:40,369 --> 00:25:40,689
It's great.

447
00:25:40,709 --> 00:25:42,270
It's a ‑‑ it really helped me clarify a lot of things and give some terminology

448
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:42,730
that was useful to me.

449
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:42,930
Thank you.

450
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,330
And I appreciate it.

451
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:43,550
Thank you.

452
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:43,770
Thank you.

453
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,410
And thank you for listening.

454
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,071
And thank you for your attention.

455
00:25:45,091 --> 00:25:46,111
And I'm going to go ahead and close out the session.

456
00:25:46,131 --> 00:25:46,691
And I'll be back in a minute.

457
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:46,892
Thank you.

458
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:46,972
Bye.

459
00:25:46,992 --> 00:25:47,052
Bye.

460
00:25:47,072 --> 00:25:47,132
Bye.

461
00:25:47,152 --> 00:25:47,212
Bye.

462

Bye.

463
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:47,372
Bye.

464
00:25:47,392 --> 00:25:47,452
Bye.

465
00:25:47,472 --> 00:25:47,532
Bye.

466
00:25:47,552 --> 00:25:47,612
Bye.

467
00:25:47,632 --> 00:25:47,692
Bye.

468
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:47,772
Bye.

469
00:25:47,792 --> 00:25:47,852
Bye.

470
00:25:47,872 --> 00:25:47,932
Bye.

471

Bye.

472
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,092
Bye.

473
00:25:48,112 --> 00:25:48,172
Bye.

474
00:25:48,192 --> 00:25:48,252
Bye.

475
00:25:48,272 --> 00:25:48,332

Bye.

477
00:25:48,432 --> 00:25:48,492
Bye.

478
00:25:49,321 --> 00:25:53,582
And then lastly, if you're a designer that's practiced in making levels for a very specific

479
00:25:53,622 --> 00:25:57,963
sort of game, don't fear if you find yourself in a situation where you have to branch out

480
00:25:57,983 --> 00:26:01,544
and do something different because your skills are very much transferable.

481
00:26:01,924 --> 00:26:06,666
You just have to trust yourself and look at the general principles behind the things you're

482
00:26:06,686 --> 00:26:09,627
doing instead of like the specific implementations.

483
00:26:10,547 --> 00:26:11,227
And thank you very much.

484
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:11,687
That's my talk.

485
00:26:21,019 --> 00:26:25,925
So we have time for questions if anyone wants to come up to the mics and ask a thing.

486
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:36,038
No questions. Or I could do a little dance. It's fine. Oh, right, right. Hello.

487
00:26:37,492 --> 00:26:43,693
So, I was actually curious, like, were all of the enemies in this project virtually complete

488
00:26:43,713 --> 00:26:47,514
by the time you started designing levels around them, or was there a little bit of iteration

489
00:26:47,574 --> 00:26:49,015
on those in the process?

490
00:26:49,055 --> 00:26:54,516
So the question was if the enemies were complete when I was building levels using them.

491
00:26:55,938 --> 00:27:01,025
weren't totally complete but there was a lot that had already been done. In fact, when I was

492
00:27:01,065 --> 00:27:06,031
building those north rooms, one of the reasons they put me on that was they had prototyped

493
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:10,437
some north enemies already and they wanted to see like, you know, what was the

494
00:27:10,617 --> 00:27:14,200
what are the spaces like that we're going to use these? And we ended up like taking

495
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:19,043
several of them and sort of combining their functionality to like cut individual enemy

496
00:27:19,083 --> 00:27:25,768
types and figure out how we could get one enemy doing the same job of multiples. So there

497
00:27:25,788 --> 00:27:30,371
was like a pallet of enemies, but there was still iteration to be done, you know, after

498
00:27:30,411 --> 00:27:35,015
trying them out in the levels and seeing, oh, this guy actually isn't very fun. We should

499
00:27:35,035 --> 00:27:38,837
probably cut it and this guy can, you know, also do that job.

500
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:41,819
Over here.

501
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:42,199
Hi.

502
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:43,439
Excuse me.

503
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:48,261
One thing I've noticed frequently happens when doing levels in 3D is that when art is

504
00:27:48,301 --> 00:27:52,182
applied, many of the things break and have to be redone or adjusted.

505
00:27:52,202 --> 00:27:57,023
I was wondering, first of all, you recognize this situation and going to 2D, does the same

506
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:59,324
thing happen or does it happen differently?

507
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,784
Could you speak to that?

508
00:28:01,688 --> 00:28:05,271
On this particular project, I didn't notice it being as much of a problem.

509
00:28:05,311 --> 00:28:09,775
So the question was about how in 3D games, often, you know, when you go from the gray

510
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:14,299
box to the environment art gets in there, then a lot of things break, you know, like

511
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:17,462
visual cues or like cover heights or stuff like that.

512
00:28:17,982 --> 00:28:19,504
And did the same thing happen?

513
00:28:20,144 --> 00:28:24,906
And I don't think it did, but part of that is because it was a small team.

514
00:28:24,966 --> 00:28:26,567
We were all working really closely together.

515
00:28:27,227 --> 00:28:34,611
And they had already set up a pretty good established metrics for this is the sprite

516
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,812
size, this is the collision box.

517
00:28:36,852 --> 00:28:38,793
We can't change that, but we can change the art.

518
00:28:38,813 --> 00:28:40,553
I think Alex is somewhere here in the audience.

519
00:28:45,115 --> 00:28:46,296
You know, we'd done a lot of it.

520
00:28:46,576 --> 00:28:48,457
He still had a lot of time to iterate and polish

521
00:28:48,497 --> 00:28:50,257
on the visual look, but it didn't really

522
00:28:50,358 --> 00:28:53,579
disrupt the level design much at all.

523
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:55,600
But again, I don't know if that's a quality of 2D

524
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,161
or if that's just a quality of this team's process

525
00:28:58,221 --> 00:28:58,601
that they made.

526
00:28:59,281 --> 00:28:59,841
OK, thank you.

527
00:29:01,945 --> 00:29:07,673
In 3D level design, things like object placement, lighting and weenies can guide players

528
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:12,800
towards their goals and prevent them from getting lost. We transferred to 2D. I'm curious how

529
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,184
many of those lessons were transferable and what you discovered along the way.

530
00:29:16,666 --> 00:29:22,028
So the question is about basically how in 3D, like placing objects to like lure players'

531
00:29:22,068 --> 00:29:25,989
places or, you know, show them like the goal of where they're trying to get to and did

532
00:29:26,009 --> 00:29:31,931
that apply in 2D? It did. Actually that was one of my cut sections was about using rewards,

533
00:29:32,211 --> 00:29:37,553
like denying rewards to like get the players curious and interested. It's just a different

534
00:29:37,573 --> 00:29:42,814
approach because of the view. So, for example, there was a part of the level where, you know,

535
00:29:42,834 --> 00:29:44,935
you have these blocks. You can see the exit.

536
00:29:46,356 --> 00:29:49,858
And you see up here, like, on a different level, it's like, you know, it's one of the

537
00:29:49,878 --> 00:29:51,459
big things you're trying to collect.

538
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:53,541
And so you're like, oh, I need to get up there.

539
00:29:54,361 --> 00:29:58,264
But rather than I need to get there and, you know, this is the steps I'm going to take

540
00:29:58,284 --> 00:29:58,624
to get there.

541
00:29:58,664 --> 00:29:59,885
It's I need to get there.

542
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:00,706
I know it's there.

543
00:30:00,826 --> 00:30:06,250
I need to, like, go and explore, like, off screen to find the way to get up there and

544
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:06,590
have, like, a ‑‑

545
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:14,720
general relative idea of where to go. So it served a similar function of navigation, but the

546
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,904
way the player, like, carries it out was a bit different.

547
00:30:18,718 --> 00:30:19,479
Cool, thank you very much.

548
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:22,701
All right, I think I have time for one more?

549
00:30:23,362 --> 00:30:23,562
One more?

550
00:30:23,582 --> 00:30:24,323
Two more, two more, okay.

551
00:30:24,343 --> 00:30:24,723
More, okay.

552
00:30:25,143 --> 00:30:25,444
Yes, go.

553
00:30:25,564 --> 00:30:26,385
Hi, thanks for the talk.

554
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:29,968
You said that there are situations

555
00:30:30,008 --> 00:30:32,090
where an environment artist break your work

556
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,672
because they do whatever too much

557
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:37,514
or they don't care about block out forever.

558
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:40,777
But how do you approach this kind of cooperation

559
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,419
with environment art while you're doing the block out

560
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,500
and the first pass on?

561
00:30:45,341 --> 00:30:46,521
when you start to work on your blockout,

562
00:30:47,361 --> 00:30:50,582
do you try to grab the feedback from environment artists

563
00:30:50,602 --> 00:30:53,803
to see how they feel and how they see the level?

564
00:30:54,643 --> 00:30:55,103
How does it work?

565
00:30:55,323 --> 00:30:57,684
So the question was, how do you sort of cooperate

566
00:30:57,724 --> 00:31:00,144
with environment artists when you're building the level

567
00:31:00,204 --> 00:31:03,545
to get their input so that things don't just break

568
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:04,225
when art goes in?

569
00:31:04,785 --> 00:31:06,866
And it was different depending on the project,

570
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:07,806
depending on the company.

571
00:31:09,007 --> 00:31:12,990
a lot, you know, on the games I worked on in Insomniac, we worked really closely with

572
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:18,594
environment artists on the linear games. So, you know, I remember, you know, going to the

573
00:31:18,614 --> 00:31:22,076
environment artists with my very initial maps, being like, I'm thinking something like this.

574
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:25,739
Can you see any problems? And he was like, oh, you're going to have line to draw problems

575
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:29,922
in this area. How about doing it this way? So working really closely one on one, like

576
00:31:29,962 --> 00:31:34,346
throughout the process helped. Sunset Overdrive was a little different because since it was

577
00:31:34,366 --> 00:31:35,026
an open world.

578
00:31:36,507 --> 00:31:41,889
It was more that we had like our main designer in charge of like the world traversal and

579
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:42,909
the main environment artists.

580
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:48,031
They were like, you know, had this symbiotic brain relationship of building the world together.

581
00:31:48,051 --> 00:31:51,592
And it was a lot more like using modular pieces from that.

582
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:56,974
And again, similar like owning certain areas and communicating with the artists from those

583
00:31:57,034 --> 00:31:58,294
areas from the beginning.

584
00:31:58,854 --> 00:32:00,795
And like I said on HyperLite, the team was very small.

585
00:32:00,895 --> 00:32:04,376
So it was just sort of naturally implied communication.

586
00:32:04,576 --> 00:32:05,076
You know, we would.

587
00:32:06,577 --> 00:32:10,758
At the end of the day, after I marked something up, I would have them come play and Alex might

588
00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:16,740
be like this is going to look kind of janky, try and avoid jagged corners.

589
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:24,482
He had a set of metrics for visuals for how to make things look the best way they could

590
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:25,903
and so what things to avoid.

591
00:32:26,683 --> 00:32:30,504
So that had already been sort of established before I got on the team so it was very useful

592
00:32:30,544 --> 00:32:31,064
in that regard.

593
00:32:33,525 --> 00:32:33,725
All right.

594
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:34,325
I think that's it.

595
00:32:34,445 --> 00:32:35,105
Thanks again, everyone.

596
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:35,305
Thank you.
