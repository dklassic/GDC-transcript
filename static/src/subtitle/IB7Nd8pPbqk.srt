00:00:09,617 --> 00:00:11,440
Hello and welcome to Day of the Devs 2000,

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,503
I gotta figure out what I'm gonna call this thing.

3
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:15,326
Day of the Devs 2000 GC.

4
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:16,187
It's on the wall.

5
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,254
Hi everybody and welcome to Day of the Devs.

6
00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:42,718
That's right, we're doing a special edition of Day of the Devs

7
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:44,421
where you can watch it in your very own home,

8
00:00:44,521 --> 00:00:46,124
safe from all disease and infection.

9
00:00:46,224 --> 00:00:48,628
And just the only thing that will infect you here is love.

10
00:00:48,908 --> 00:00:49,970
Love for video games.

11
00:00:51,132 --> 00:00:55,756
Greg here and his pals have gathered together 12 great games to show to you.

12
00:00:55,856 --> 00:01:00,400
And it was originally going to be at a live show during GDC, but the Game Developers Conference was postponed.

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,904
But they have supported us in sharing this with you in a more direct sort of way.

14
00:01:05,464 --> 00:01:10,609
And hopefully when it comes back as a show, there'll be GDC Day of the Devs there too.

15
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:11,169
But for now...

16
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,231
Tell us how this all works, Greg. How did this game come together?

17
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:18,233
We've been doing Data Devs, Double Fine and IMAPIT have been hosting this for eight years now.

18
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:20,495
This is the eighth year of doing this. It's crazy.

19
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:26,358
And it started trying to put a spotlight on amazing indie developers and indie games throughout the industry.

20
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:31,600
So we always try to find the best games we can from around the world.

21
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,682
So we work with all of our friends at various platform holders,

22
00:01:34,902 --> 00:01:40,124
basically all of them, PlayStation and Xbox and Nintendo and Steam and Epic,

23
00:01:40,244 --> 00:01:43,405
and we all get together and talk about our favorite indie games coming out and kind of

24
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:47,707
across platforms decide what are the most exciting things that we can be showing.

25
00:01:48,347 --> 00:01:48,828
So we have

26
00:01:49,428 --> 00:01:52,429
A bunch of people we reach out to, over 300 submissions every year,

27
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:54,731
and we've curated that down to this list of 12 games

28
00:01:54,791 --> 00:01:58,533
and try to have a really kind of broad spectrum of diverse games

29
00:01:58,593 --> 00:02:00,214
from people all over the world.

30
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:03,095
We've got stuff from Germany and from Japan,

31
00:02:03,835 --> 00:02:08,578
from Denmark, big teams, small teams, some student projects,

32
00:02:09,398 --> 00:02:13,600
and they all have very diverse styles in terms of visuals and game mechanics,

33
00:02:13,661 --> 00:02:16,562
and we're trying to find things that are really pushing the industry forward

34
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:17,823
in unique and interesting ways.

35
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:22,503
That's great, and so glad we were able to do this, because a lot of people...

36
00:02:23,284 --> 00:02:26,266
GDC is one of those events that helps you promote your games,

37
00:02:26,286 --> 00:02:30,629
and for indie developers, you don't have money to just buy ads and promote your games,

38
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:32,730
so it was really an important event for them,

39
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:35,412
and then it seemed so heartbreaking that GDC wouldn't happen,

40
00:02:36,013 --> 00:02:37,434
for good reasons, of course, but...

41
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:41,356
So that's why I'm so glad that we were able to still have this show and share these games,

42
00:02:41,737 --> 00:02:44,338
and so thanks to our sponsors for sticking with us.

43
00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:45,899
Yeah, we've got 12 games to show.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,021
One of them is a world premiere.

45
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:49,122
World premiere!

46
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:50,102
World premiere.

47
00:02:50,543 --> 00:02:53,084
And yeah, like we said, every year we try to really focus

48
00:02:53,164 --> 00:02:55,506
on the developers, make it very easy for them.

49
00:02:56,827 --> 00:02:58,708
It's a free event, we handle all the setup,

50
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:00,630
all of the hardware and everything,

51
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,191
and that is thanks to all of our sponsors

52
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:03,091
who chip in and help.

53
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:09,536
That's the Game Developers Conference, which are letting us do this stream and have graciously hosted this.

54
00:03:09,977 --> 00:03:16,682
And we will have a selection of games, maybe some of these, maybe some new ones at TDC once it happens down the road.

55
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:23,688
PlayStation, ID at Xbox, Nintendo, Epic Games, Steam, Humble Bundle, NVIDIA, Logitech, and Astro Gaming

56
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:29,813
all help with hardware in various forms and helping support the event financially as well.

57
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:30,434
For many years.

58
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:34,056
And also, a very extra special thanks to DoseOne,

59
00:03:34,096 --> 00:03:35,736
who provided music for the stream.

60
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:38,337
Always kicking beats. Dose is the best.

61
00:03:38,778 --> 00:03:40,018
I don't know how he finds the time.

62
00:03:40,498 --> 00:03:42,859
He's in like 12 of the games that we're gonna show.

63
00:03:42,899 --> 00:03:44,880
He's on multiple games in the showcase.

64
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:46,801
Well, let's get to the games. I'm excited.

65
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:47,441
What's the first one?

66
00:03:47,952 --> 00:03:49,832
First game we're gonna look at is Cloudpunk.

67
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:53,534
It's from a studio called Ionlands in Berlin, Germany.

68
00:03:54,954 --> 00:03:56,655
You can see, I think, a little bit sneak peek

69
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:58,276
of this behind, but we'll cut to gameplay soon.

70
00:03:58,756 --> 00:04:01,617
It's a noir, neo-noir adventure story game

71
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:05,659
set in kind of a cyberpunk, voxel world

72
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:09,760
where you play as an employee of a delivery service

73
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,241
delivering packages around the world.

74
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:20,027
Obviously it unfolds and there's a lot of intrigue behind it, but it kind of has a little bit of those crazy taxi vibes of delivering packages throughout this beautiful landscape.

75
00:04:20,347 --> 00:04:29,634
So, enjoy.

76
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:33,596
Control, I'm at the destination and no one is here.

77
00:04:34,597 --> 00:04:36,939
Control? Camus, are you awake?

78
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:40,901
Yes, I am awake. Excited! Want to help?

79
00:04:41,763 --> 00:04:47,786
Can you scan the area? Local scan. Look for ID chips on possible delivery containers.

80
00:04:48,947 --> 00:04:54,349
I don't know how. Wait, I know how. I think. What is box?

81
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,971
A box is a square cube.

82
00:04:58,051 --> 00:05:01,413
No, what is that box? It's right there.

83
00:05:02,373 --> 00:05:05,075
Okay, I see it. I guess that's the package then.

84
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,217
Why is no one here? I have bad feelings.

85
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:10,738
Me too, Camus.

86
00:05:35,182 --> 00:05:36,723
I hear... noise.

87
00:05:37,723 --> 00:05:38,604
What noise, Camus?

88
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:42,267
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

89
00:05:42,687 --> 00:05:43,708
From the package.

90
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:45,369
I hear it too.

91
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,051
I still have bad feelings.

92
00:05:49,252 --> 00:05:51,133
One second, Camus. Control, come in.

93
00:05:53,295 --> 00:05:57,117
Control, this is Driver 14 FC. Come in, this is important.

94
00:05:58,278 --> 00:06:02,961
Driver 14 FC, this is Control. Please deliver your current package with urgency.

95
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,291
Control, why is this package ticking?

96
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:10,135
Don't let Ginger have to do this.

97
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:12,436
Call the response.

98
00:06:13,798 --> 00:06:14,838
Fuck the Tiller.

99
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:17,480
Control, what's happening there?

100
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:19,922
Uh, nothing.

101
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:23,645
I've been informed that you're to stop calling us about the package.

102
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:24,906
Deliver it quickly.

103
00:06:25,327 --> 00:06:26,248
That is all, please.

104
00:06:26,828 --> 00:06:28,730
No more communication until delivery.

105
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,172
Camus, I don't know what to do.

106
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:33,253
I am nervous.

107
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:34,819
Why?

108
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,581
I am nervous, because you are nervous.

109
00:06:39,222 --> 00:06:41,063
Maybe we can throw away the Tik Tok.

110
00:06:41,423 --> 00:06:42,744
Tik Tok, Tik Tok, Tik Tok, Tik Tok.

111
00:06:44,045 --> 00:06:44,425
Maybe.

112
00:06:44,986 --> 00:06:47,467
I could dump it at the trash chute in Section 8B.

113
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:51,130
That sends it into the refuse collection at the base of the city.

114
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,091
Nothing ever comes back from there.

115
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:55,673
Will Mr. Control be mad?

116
00:06:56,894 --> 00:06:59,856
Yes, but I get a bad feeling too, Canis.

117
00:07:00,356 --> 00:07:01,937
I think it will be bad either way.

118
00:07:03,058 --> 00:07:04,018
I want to help, but...

119
00:07:04,886 --> 00:07:05,767
don't know what to do.

120
00:07:05,787 --> 00:07:07,790
I know, Camus. I know.

121
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:10,013
I just have to make a call on this one.

122
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,501
I guess it was nothing.

123
00:07:44,362 --> 00:07:45,562
We did our job, Camus.

124
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:47,664
We shouldn't ask so many questions.

125
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:49,925
I am not sure.

126
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:52,066
You want to say something?

127
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:54,328
If it is okay?

128
00:07:55,228 --> 00:07:55,529
Sure.

129
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,031
Is this a job good?

130
00:08:00,212 --> 00:08:00,872
It pays good.

131
00:08:02,113 --> 00:08:03,334
Are we doing good things?

132
00:08:04,494 --> 00:08:06,175
No more questions, please, Camus.

133
00:08:07,756 --> 00:08:08,137
Okay.

134
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:10,218
That's awesome.

135
00:08:10,238 --> 00:08:10,998
So what is the next game?

136
00:08:12,007 --> 00:08:14,328
Next up is Chickory, A Colorful Tale.

137
00:08:14,748 --> 00:08:18,270
So this is from Greg Lubinov, who created Wandersong,

138
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,331
which I know you played and loved.

139
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:20,752
Yeah.

140
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,953
And I think you can tell it's in the DNA of the game.

141
00:08:22,993 --> 00:08:26,475
It feels like it comes from him, because it does.

142
00:08:27,055 --> 00:08:29,216
And I think if you think about Wandersong as...

143
00:08:30,717 --> 00:08:36,740
quirky adventure narrative game about music. This is that but about art.

144
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,902
So it's basically said the main premise is that you're in this world where

145
00:08:40,922 --> 00:08:44,864
there's this famous artist named Chicory who goes missing and with

146
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:49,086
her all the color of the world also goes missing. And so you pick up her brush and

147
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:52,948
kind of take the helm and are there to bring color back to the world and find

148
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:54,569
out what happened to Chicory.

149
00:08:55,289 --> 00:09:02,754
So you have this magical paintbrush and are able to actually paint on the black and white landscape like it's a coloring book.

150
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:09,538
I think the mechanics are kind of a Zelda-like world, but obviously has a beautiful art style of its own.

151
00:09:10,158 --> 00:09:14,461
Also, the music is from Lena Raine, who we know and are friends of.

152
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:20,085
Did the music on Celeste and many wonderful projects as well, so that'll be a highlight as well.

153
00:09:35,193 --> 00:09:35,277
you

154
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:12,039
We're as good as done, are we?

155
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,080
Let's make friends!

156
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,302
Hey girl, have we met before?

157
00:10:18,322 --> 00:10:21,824
Nope, maybe 15 years?

158
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:24,326
Look, you really like my clothes!

159
00:10:24,366 --> 00:10:26,067
Right, beautiful girl?

160
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:28,428
Right, classy girl?

161
00:10:28,448 --> 00:10:30,749
Right, yes, classy boys and girls...

162
00:10:30,849 --> 00:10:31,009
Woah

163
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,551
Oh, congrats, you got this girl!

164
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,571
Hey, there you go!

165
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:35,172
Tell me...

166
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:22,704
Yes.

167
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,445
Because I done did it.

168
00:11:25,505 --> 00:11:25,745
Don't

169
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:26,726
Forget

170
00:11:26,746 --> 00:11:26,966

171
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:27,946

173

Thank you.

174
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,301
Well, Greg, I think we should carry on.

175
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:17,702
It's not funny yet.

176
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:19,163
Am I supposed to respond to that?

177
00:12:19,183 --> 00:12:20,303
It's gonna be funny as soon as you... yeah.

178
00:12:20,444 --> 00:12:20,744
Okay.

179
00:12:22,244 --> 00:12:23,345
Next is Carry On.

180
00:12:23,365 --> 00:12:23,865
Yes!

181
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:24,906
Yes.

182
00:12:25,926 --> 00:12:26,567
Joke landed.

183
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:27,187
Perfect.

184
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:28,668
You're the king of them.

185
00:12:29,388 --> 00:12:31,389
Yeah, next we're gonna look at a game called Carry On

186
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:36,291
from a studio called Phobia Game Studios in Warsaw, Poland.

187
00:12:38,072 --> 00:12:41,374
Yeah, they pitched this game as a reverse horror game

188
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:45,656
in that you are the animal doing the dirty beats.

189
00:12:46,496 --> 00:12:49,157
So you're in the role of this kind of like amorphous blob

190
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:53,279
that is destroying the world and stalking and consuming

191
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,900
all of these enemies around you.

192
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,281
The structure of the game is kind of Metroidvania, so...

193
00:12:59,242 --> 00:13:01,323
getting new abilities and unlocking new areas.

194
00:13:01,343 --> 00:13:05,446
But I think just you can tell from looking at how good it feels

195
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:09,569
and how much you just want to take control of that blob and cause mayhem.

196
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:10,369
It's very satisfying.

197
00:13:10,609 --> 00:13:11,870
It's like being the creature from the thing.

198
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,071
Yeah.

199
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,852
And he's really empathize...

200
00:13:14,892 --> 00:13:15,933
Infili... What's the word?

201
00:13:16,353 --> 00:13:17,014
He really empathize.

202
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:18,884
Yes.

203
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:20,485
He didn't ask to be born.

204
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:22,086
They can all relate to that.

205
00:13:22,106 --> 00:13:24,387
He just wants to get revenge.

206
00:13:24,907 --> 00:13:25,247
Exactly.

207
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:26,608
It's the scientists that created him.

208
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:56,455
I

209
00:16:43,057 --> 00:16:46,899
Next up is Komako from Half Past Yellow.

210
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,640
It's a new studio out of Copenhagen.

211
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:51,161
It's an adventure game.

212
00:16:51,181 --> 00:16:52,101
You like adventure games.

213
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:52,682
Yeah.

214
00:16:53,302 --> 00:16:53,742
Yeah.

215
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,863
A hand-drawn adventure game.

216
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:55,723
Oh my God, it's beautiful.

217
00:16:55,743 --> 00:16:56,663
Yeah, it is beautiful.

218
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:57,084
Look at that.

219
00:16:57,324 --> 00:16:57,964
Very striking.

220
00:16:58,064 --> 00:16:59,765
I think it's hard to not see a GIF

221
00:16:59,865 --> 00:17:01,726
or an image of this and be intrigued.

222
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:05,347
I love the color palette and the style of the,

223
00:17:06,488 --> 00:17:07,208
let's call it the art.

224
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:09,949
Yeah, it's very unique and personal.

225
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:11,030
And they have reflective puddles.

226
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:11,750
We don't have reflective puddles.

227
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,771
There's no other game that looks like that for sure.

228
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:20,594
And it's a neat mix of kind of like 90s cartoon and like indie comic zine world

229
00:17:20,654 --> 00:17:21,714
that you don't really see in games.

230
00:17:21,754 --> 00:17:24,055
So I think that's super fresh and obviously we love adventure games.

231
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:51,129
You know what game I love?

232
00:20:52,011 --> 00:20:52,271
Minute.

233
00:20:52,531 --> 00:20:53,152
You ever played Minute?

234
00:20:53,273 --> 00:20:53,693
I love that game.

235
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:54,134
It's really good.

236
00:20:54,174 --> 00:20:56,057
If we could ever get a game by the people who made Minute,

237
00:20:56,077 --> 00:20:57,059
I'd be super psyched.

238
00:20:57,718 --> 00:21:00,780
Well, the next game that we're going to look at is Disc Room.

239
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,583
It's a super group that includes developers of Minit, Kitticalis, and JW,

240
00:21:06,203 --> 00:21:08,845
but also Terry Vellman and DoseOne, who did Heavy Bullets,

241
00:21:09,285 --> 00:21:11,287
coming together for this amazing game.

242
00:21:12,327 --> 00:21:15,670
It's a very hardcore game where death is inevitable.

243
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,351
You're going to die all the time,

244
00:21:17,371 --> 00:21:20,593
and it's about prolonging your life and surviving.

245
00:21:21,353 --> 00:21:24,095
So yeah, the premise of the game is there's rooms full of discs

246
00:21:24,155 --> 00:21:27,357
that are there to kill you, and you have to survive as long as possible.

247
00:21:27,717 --> 00:21:29,779
that starts unraveling in different ways,

248
00:21:29,879 --> 00:21:32,721
and sometimes you have to die in multiple different ways,

249
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:35,163
or sometimes there's very cryptic alien puzzles

250
00:21:35,183 --> 00:21:36,043
that you're trying to solve,

251
00:21:36,103 --> 00:21:39,146
but ultimately traversing this series of rooms

252
00:21:39,226 --> 00:21:40,527
full of deadly disks.

253
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:42,588
They call it a dodge-em-up.

254
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,111
There is a set of abilities you'll get over time,

255
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:51,755
like dodges and things like that, but never any guns.

256
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,217
So always gonna be about survival and passive.

257
00:21:54,377 --> 00:21:58,020
They're obviously against violence, I can tell by looking at this game.

258
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,721
Actually, I haven't seen any blood yet.

259
00:22:00,482 --> 00:22:01,203
Yeah, it's pretty hardcore.

260
00:22:01,223 --> 00:22:02,364
How are they staying alive so long?

261
00:22:03,084 --> 00:22:04,345
I'm already stressed out.

262
00:22:04,705 --> 00:22:09,329
It has that perfect tuning where you always are about to die

263
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,351
right when the time runs up and then you do it.

264
00:22:12,412 --> 00:22:13,893
So, enjoy. Don't die.

265
00:22:14,514 --> 00:22:16,636
Well, yeah. I accept it.

266
00:22:16,796 --> 00:22:18,377
And it was all about time.

267
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,078
It got me used to that.

268
00:22:58,808 --> 00:22:58,948
Oh

269
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:09,117
And that's it.

270
00:24:09,257 --> 00:24:16,900
I hope you enjoyed this video.

271
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:25,663
If you did, please leave a like and subscribe.

272
00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:32,185
I'll see you next time.

273
00:24:32,205 --> 00:24:32,285
Bye.

274
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:38,916
Oh

275
00:26:00,906 --> 00:26:01,522
Ooh, this one's pretty.

276
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:03,919
Yes, it is.

277
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,421
Let's talk about it. This is Rainy Season.

278
00:26:08,341 --> 00:26:09,302
It's actually a student game.

279
00:26:09,722 --> 00:26:14,325
So this is a Japanese illustration student who is doing video games as a hobby

280
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:16,165
and doing a very good job of it, obviously.

281
00:26:16,946 --> 00:26:21,728
And it's a life sim about kind of just living your life in the rainy season in Japan,

282
00:26:22,689 --> 00:26:25,090
interacting with your family members and talking to them,

283
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:28,332
picking up objects and interacting with them as well,

284
00:26:28,452 --> 00:26:31,894
and daydreaming about life outside of the rain.

285
00:26:32,414 --> 00:26:35,377
So it's like Shenmue, but a little key Shenmue.

286
00:26:35,397 --> 00:26:39,743
Yeah, yeah. It's like life in Japan in a quiet way, I suppose.

287
00:26:40,243 --> 00:26:44,529
And, I mean, anyone who has visited Japan, it feels like very nostalgic.

288
00:26:44,589 --> 00:26:47,132
It feels like you're there. So it's pretty neat.

289
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:51,877
How many times have we waited for sound of rain like this?

290
00:27:51,897 --> 00:28:00,605
It's been more than a year since the sound of rain this much.

291
00:28:00,666 --> 00:28:00,746
Ouch!

292
00:28:00,806 --> 00:28:01,647
Thank you very much!

293
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:56,173
Thanks for watching!

294
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:43,385
You

295
00:30:20,469 --> 00:30:20,989
What's next?

296
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,511
Up next is Heavenly Bodies from Two Point Interactive,

297
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,913
a studio in Melbourne, Australia.

298
00:30:28,614 --> 00:30:29,915
A hotspot of indie games.

299
00:30:29,955 --> 00:30:33,317
I feel like every year there's more and more Australian games in Day of the Dead.

300
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:36,500
The main show we had like eight last year, so they just keep coming.

301
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,162
And actually, the team shares a space with the House House guys,

302
00:30:40,202 --> 00:30:42,964
who did Untitled Goose Game, everyone's favorite.

303
00:30:42,984 --> 00:30:45,006
Did they split the rent evenly?

304
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:48,267
It's actually a larger workspace, there's even more people who work there.

305
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:50,368
But lots of cool games coming out of there.

306
00:30:51,208 --> 00:30:54,689
This is a physics-based game about cosmonauts

307
00:30:55,149 --> 00:30:58,110
who are kind of dealing with a variety of scenarios in space.

308
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,111
And grabbing things.

309
00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:01,832
Trying to grab things, trying to deal with, I guess,

310
00:31:03,252 --> 00:31:06,653
the unpredictable nature of zero gravity.

311
00:31:06,853 --> 00:31:09,094
And it's a co-op game, which we don't see a lot of anymore,

312
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:09,914
and I love co-op games.

313
00:31:11,835 --> 00:31:14,076
Will there be two astronauts on the screen during co-op mode?

314
00:31:14,536 --> 00:31:21,819
Hopefully, you will see gameplay of co-op because you can play single player, but obviously it's more fun. Everything's more fun when it's co-op

315
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,241
Except if your partner's really bad

316
00:31:25,261 --> 00:31:26,961
Which probably will happen in this game

317
00:31:27,782 --> 00:31:28,582
You killed us!

318
00:31:28,622 --> 00:31:31,523
That's the point. Why did you? Is Sandra Bullock in this?

319
00:31:32,804 --> 00:31:36,866
I don't believe so. Maybe if it does well as a single player. Well, you can pretend that Sandra Bullock is in that outfit

320
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:45,170
Thanks for watching!

321
00:32:11,731 --> 00:32:12,692
To be continued...

322
00:32:40,805 --> 00:32:43,127
nonverbal techniques are very powerful

323
00:32:43,147 --> 00:32:46,088
Nonverbal techniques are very powerful

324
00:32:46,188 --> 00:32:49,370
Nonverbal techniques are very powerful

Updated daily Monday to Friday.

330
00:34:38,765 --> 00:34:39,725
Thanks for watching!

331
00:34:58,225 --> 00:34:59,927
Let's look at some more awesome games, Greg Rice.

332
00:35:00,287 --> 00:35:00,988
Let's do it.

333
00:35:01,428 --> 00:35:02,349
We got Sludge Life.

334
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,154
We already saw a game from this duo, Terry Vellman and DoseOne.

335
00:35:06,234 --> 00:35:07,235
We did Heavy Bullets together.

336
00:35:07,395 --> 00:35:08,136
Back in action.

337
00:35:08,336 --> 00:35:08,897
Overachievers.

338
00:35:08,977 --> 00:35:10,479
Yeah, two games in one year.

339
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:10,759
Wow.

340
00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:11,920
I don't know that that's happened before.

341
00:35:12,941 --> 00:35:16,402
Yeah, so this is collaborators on Heavy Bullets and Disc Room.

342
00:35:16,662 --> 00:35:19,003
Also, Dosey did the music for Gang Beasts.

343
00:35:19,023 --> 00:35:23,224
Doing kind of a first-person, open-world narrative sandbox game.

344
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:28,306
So it's just a world you can freely roam and talk to whoever you want.

345
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:30,647
And it's just kind of oozing with style.

346
00:35:30,907 --> 00:35:34,608
You play as a graffiti artist and all the characters are very colorful

347
00:35:34,688 --> 00:35:36,749
and have interesting, strange things to say.

348
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:40,830
So, just a cool space to be in and live a little life for a while.

349
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:46,273
Indeed. Yeah. And it has good music. Of course yeah, it dosed it all music and writing so it's uh

350
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:50,995
sounds good it's got lots of funny weird jokes. It's a dose explosion. It is.

351
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:01,515
Oh

352
00:38:46,376 --> 00:38:46,516
you

353
00:39:16,926 --> 00:39:21,107
This is Paper Beast. Up next, Paper Beast from Pixel Reef, led by Air Chahi.

354
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:23,428
Wait, hold on, start over. I'm distracted.

355
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:26,229
You were so into it. Yeah, you were zoning into it.

356
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:27,609
What is this crazy thing, Greg?

357
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:31,250
This is Paper Beast from Pixel Reef, led by Air Chahi.

358
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,751
Oh. Yeah, he's a legend.

359
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:34,711
Legend. He's a legend. You know about legends.

360
00:39:34,851 --> 00:39:35,312
Another world.

361
00:39:35,632 --> 00:39:39,074
Yes, he did Another World and From Dust, and I think when you see this game,

362
00:39:39,094 --> 00:39:40,775
you can see it pulls elements of both of those.

363
00:39:40,815 --> 00:39:42,816
Yeah, that's what I was like, is this From Dust?

364
00:39:42,836 --> 00:39:43,476
Because it has the...

365
00:39:43,877 --> 00:39:46,938
It has, yeah, it has the mechanics of From Dust and just like...

366
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:48,159
Landscape forming.

367
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:49,900
...style of Another World.

368
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,322
Yeah, they're out of France. It's a VR title.

369
00:39:52,402 --> 00:39:56,144
So it seems to be a very meditative space to be in.

370
00:39:56,924 --> 00:40:00,367
It's an adventure game, but also kind of this interactive sandbox world

371
00:40:00,427 --> 00:40:03,368
to play with full of giant paper beasts.

372
00:43:03,896 --> 00:43:04,058
Oh

373
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:01,557
More? Can there be more?

374
00:44:01,657 --> 00:44:02,818
There are more. We got more games.

375
00:44:03,298 --> 00:44:05,160
Next up is She Dreams Elsewhere

376
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,222
from Studio Zevier

377
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:08,403
in Cleveland, Ohio.

378
00:44:08,843 --> 00:44:11,185
Which I think is actually just a one-person studio, mostly.

379
00:44:11,765 --> 00:44:12,406
Davian Gooden

380
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:14,888
making this game with a few collaborators

381
00:44:14,928 --> 00:44:17,270
and friends, but it's a surreal

382
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,811
adventure game RPG

383
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:20,793
about a

384
00:44:20,953 --> 00:44:22,915
comatose woman where you're

385
00:44:23,255 --> 00:44:25,197
kind of exploring her dreams and her world.

386
00:44:26,598 --> 00:44:31,801
A lot of commentary on mental health and anxiety and things like that.

387
00:44:32,701 --> 00:44:35,222
And it sounds like a very personal, emotional story.

388
00:44:35,242 --> 00:44:39,485
I think the visuals and audio really jumped out at us on this one.

389
00:44:39,545 --> 00:44:42,726
It just obviously has a really unique presentation and style to it.

390
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,787
I wish you could hear it because the music is really awesome.

391
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,648
Can they hear it?

392
00:44:46,168 --> 00:44:47,109
They will be able to hear it.

393
00:44:47,529 --> 00:44:50,150
But yeah, it gives me sort of Undertale vibes,

394
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:52,391
which I think it might hopefully click in the same way for people.

395
00:45:26,776 --> 00:45:33,539
Subs By www.zeoranger.co.uk

396
00:46:30,924 --> 00:46:30,984
you

397
00:47:08,476 --> 00:47:08,518
Oh

398
00:48:18,669 --> 00:48:20,531
Up next, Skatebird.

399
00:48:20,551 --> 00:48:21,052
Skatebird!

400
00:48:21,392 --> 00:48:21,872
Woo!

401
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:23,994
Skatebird, obviously based on the hummingbird

402
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,175
that's outside of our office right now.

403
00:48:26,216 --> 00:48:28,018
It's so cute and cool at the same time.

404
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:29,039
I know, you don't have to say anything.

405
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:30,080
It sells itself, right?

406
00:48:30,811 --> 00:48:34,115
Let me sell it some more though, because this bird is sick.

407
00:48:34,775 --> 00:48:36,076
Can we still say that? Sick.

408
00:48:36,237 --> 00:48:37,037
Sick.

409
00:48:37,558 --> 00:48:40,400
Well, you mean because of the eras or the coronavirus?

410
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,943
Yeah, because everyone is sick right now.

411
00:48:43,203 --> 00:48:43,784
Oh, he died.

412
00:48:44,544 --> 00:48:46,686
You die every minute in this game. That's the gimmick of it.

413
00:48:47,107 --> 00:48:49,289
No, you're getting confused.

414
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:50,510
So, this is Cape Bird.

415
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:51,851
Get up, Arty! Get up!

416
00:48:52,352 --> 00:48:52,972
Get it, Birdie!

417
00:48:53,132 --> 00:48:53,793
And it skates.

418
00:48:54,313 --> 00:48:59,498
It's from Glass Bottom Games in Seattle, led up by Megan Fox, and it's a skateboarding

419
00:48:59,738 --> 00:49:00,339
bird game.

420
00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:02,320
And I like skateboarding games.

421
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,023
I enjoy them, but I'm way more into this one.

422
00:49:05,123 --> 00:49:07,965
And I think it's something about it.

423
00:49:08,926 --> 00:49:09,366
It's a bird.

424
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:10,788
It could be the bird.

425
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:15,252
And how the bird flaps its little wings when you do a little trick.

426
00:49:15,532 --> 00:49:16,272
Can he grab the...

427
00:49:16,312 --> 00:49:17,213
Can he do, like, grabs?

428
00:49:17,807 --> 00:49:19,227
Yeah, there's actually some narrative stuff too.

429
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:23,848
So you'll meet other birds who will come to your skate park

430
00:49:23,908 --> 00:49:26,409
and unlock other skate parks for you and have little quests for you too.

431
00:49:26,469 --> 00:49:27,229
It's called a skate nest.

432
00:49:27,689 --> 00:49:30,150
Skate nest. Oh, that's cute. Now it is called a skate nest.

433
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:32,630
Who made this game?

434
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:34,331
Megan Fox. We just said this.

435
00:49:34,811 --> 00:49:37,932
Did you overwrite all that stuff? I was transfixed by the b-roll.

436
00:49:38,012 --> 00:49:41,153
From Glass Bottom Games, a small team up in Seattle, Washington.

437
00:49:41,773 --> 00:49:43,653
Exciting. I'm really excited about this one.

438
00:49:43,673 --> 00:49:46,714
I mean, excited about all of them, but I'm really excited about this one.

439
00:49:47,129 --> 00:49:48,276
It's a silly fun one for sure.

440
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:03,386
third in flight and fifth in diving for its prey.

441
00:51:04,026 --> 00:51:12,291
But the peculiar structure of its body prevents it from making a perfect landing.

442
00:51:50,542 --> 00:51:51,963
everything that moves in the water.

443
00:51:52,283 --> 00:51:56,945
When a fish swims by, he strikes.

444
00:51:57,025 --> 00:51:59,126
And seizes the fish with his fin.

445
00:51:59,206 --> 00:52:02,488
When he sees a fish come near the surface...

446
00:52:47,344 --> 00:52:51,168
Is it time for our world premiere?

447
00:52:51,188 --> 00:52:51,388
It is.

448
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,070
We've seen so many wonderful games,

449
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:54,231
but there is one more,

450
00:52:54,251 --> 00:52:56,614
and it is a secret surprise you're seeing here

451
00:52:56,634 --> 00:52:57,295
for the first time.

452
00:52:58,116 --> 00:52:59,197
I think we're not gonna say anything.

453
00:52:59,237 --> 00:53:00,618
I'm just gonna roll footage.

454
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:01,660
You guys enjoy.

455
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,663
I need to upload the digital brain first.

456
00:53:21,444 --> 00:53:22,405
It should be in the box.

457
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:26,410
Russell, did you receive it?

458
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:27,331
It just arrived.

459
00:53:27,592 --> 00:53:27,812
Good.

460
00:53:28,132 --> 00:53:30,555
Listen, priority is to find the real cause of death.

461
00:53:48,233 --> 00:53:49,414
Looks like where the body was.

462
00:53:54,037 --> 00:53:54,717
Upload is ready.

463
00:53:59,781 --> 00:54:00,381
Evie, ready?

464
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:00,881
Yes.

465
00:54:01,122 --> 00:54:01,362
Good.

466
00:54:01,962 --> 00:54:03,823
Please scan for the latest memory you can find.

467
00:54:04,524 --> 00:54:06,185
Ideally just before her death.

468
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:06,785
Understood.

469
00:54:10,868 --> 00:54:12,209
So this is when she died.

470
00:54:17,247 --> 00:54:18,388
Hello there, Joanna.

471
00:54:21,189 --> 00:54:23,670
What was in your mind when you looked at your shadow?

472
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:31,614
Hmm. Interesting glitch on the clock.

473
00:54:37,997 --> 00:54:39,778
Reconstructing glass from memories.

474
00:54:41,118 --> 00:54:42,399
I don't think we'll ever get it right.

475
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,801
Afternoon light. Didn't she die at night?

476
00:54:51,013 --> 00:54:51,773
Afternoon light.

477
00:54:52,814 --> 00:54:53,855
Didn't she die at night?

478
00:54:56,256 --> 00:54:58,137
She might have known she was going to die.

479
00:54:58,597 --> 00:55:01,539
Is there enough data to reconstruct a subjective state of the memory?

480
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:02,019
Yes.

481
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,441
Good. I'll enter the subjective state and see what I can find.

482
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:23,547
Subjective reconstruction was successful, but I couldn't interpret all data.

483
00:55:23,747 --> 00:55:29,153
It's fine, Evie. Subjective interpretation is tough for any AI. Even a special one like you.

484
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:50,751
A picture of a dog.

485
00:55:51,952 --> 00:55:52,632
Following her?

486
00:55:58,657 --> 00:55:59,457
Her laptop.

487
00:56:16,189 --> 00:56:17,730
Maybe this is the right moment.

488
00:56:42,344 --> 00:56:43,005
That's good.

489
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:44,525
Sorry, I'm sorry.

490
00:56:44,645 --> 00:56:45,506
It's a fuck up.

491
00:56:45,526 --> 00:56:46,927
He is still waiting.

492
00:56:46,967 --> 00:57:08,277
He is still waiting.

493
00:57:33,411 --> 00:57:34,631
8% of Dream reconstructed.

494
00:57:43,576 --> 00:57:44,217
What was that?

495
00:57:44,237 --> 00:57:45,597
Holy cow, what did I just see?

496
00:57:45,637 --> 00:57:46,638
That was crazy.

497
00:57:47,118 --> 00:57:50,220
That was The Signifier from Playme Studios in Santiago, Chile.

498
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,701
And it is, I don't know, you just saw it.

499
00:57:52,781 --> 00:57:54,302
It's a crazy adventure game.

500
00:57:54,562 --> 00:57:58,825
3D, super high-end visual narrative experience

501
00:57:58,905 --> 00:58:01,646
about exploring people's minds and memories.

502
00:58:02,484 --> 00:58:03,825
That's super cool.

503
00:58:03,965 --> 00:58:04,326
Yeah.

504
00:58:04,986 --> 00:58:05,346
Awesome.

505
00:58:05,727 --> 00:58:06,307
Well, that was it.

506
00:58:06,367 --> 00:58:07,148
Wonderful games.

507
00:58:08,269 --> 00:58:08,589
Are we done?

508
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:09,329
Thanks for doing this.

509
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:10,190
Yeah.

510
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:10,590
We are.

511
00:58:11,131 --> 00:58:14,253
Thank you Double Fine and IMAPIT for a wonderful...

512
00:58:14,273 --> 00:58:16,535
Thank you Greg Rice for coming here to do this special thing.

513
00:58:16,555 --> 00:58:16,735
Of course.

514
00:58:16,755 --> 00:58:16,955
Anytimes.

515
00:58:16,995 --> 00:58:18,937
And thanks for all the devs for showing these games.

516
00:58:18,977 --> 00:58:21,179
I'm glad we were able to get them out there in some way.

517
00:58:21,419 --> 00:58:22,159
They're beautiful things.

518
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:24,201
They're coming out in many cases very soon.

519
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:25,382
So keep an eye out for them.

520
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:29,804
Again, thanks to all the sponsors and stay tuned for more Day of the Devs.

521
00:58:29,864 --> 00:58:32,026
Later this year in November we'll be doing another big showcase.

522
00:58:32,586 --> 00:58:36,428
Many more games, new games, unreleased games. It's going to be great.

523
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:40,450
And now I think it's time for the IGF and GDC Choice Awards.

524
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:41,671
No, really? Is that coming up now?

525
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:42,772
It is right now.

526
00:58:42,792 --> 00:58:44,072
Exciting. I better get ready.

527
00:58:44,332 --> 00:58:45,013
Who's going to win?
