1
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:07,852
Thanks so much for coming.

2
00:00:07,852 --> 00:00:09,893
And this talk is about 10 years with Thoreau,

3
00:00:09,893 --> 00:00:11,734
in case you're in the wrong place.

4
00:00:11,734 --> 00:00:12,955
I hope you're not.

5
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:15,976
And my name is Tracy Fullerton, and I just

6
00:00:15,976 --> 00:00:21,039
spent more than a decade making a video game

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,180
about a classic book called Walden or Life

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,522
in the Woods, which is a pretty crazy thing to have done.

9
00:00:28,322 --> 00:00:32,324
And for those of you who don't know, you probably mostly do, but I just want to be sensitive.

10
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:37,526
For those of you who don't know, Walden is a book by Henry David Thoreau,

11
00:00:37,526 --> 00:00:44,128
who was a naturalist, a philosopher, and a hermit who lived alone on the shores of Walden Pond in Massachusetts.

12
00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:47,191
from 1845 to 1847 and he wrote about his experiences there.

13
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:52,916
He wrote about why he went to live there and his thoughts about life and how we

14
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:54,117
should live it.

15
00:00:54,117 --> 00:00:57,901
And the game that I made is a first-person exploratory narrative

16
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:00,042
with a light survival set of mechanics and it's set in an

17
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:01,244
open-world simulation.

18
00:01:03,645 --> 00:01:06,266
of Walden Woods over the course of Thoreau's first year

19
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:08,526
at the Pond.

20
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:13,307
It actually just shipped on Steam yesterday

21
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:18,649
and it's also available on itch.io and on PlayStation 4

22
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:22,129
and it will be coming to Xbox this summer.

23
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:24,410
If you come down to GDC Play, we'll have a booth

24
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,590
and we'll be showing the Xbox demo

25
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,911
in case you want to check it out.

26
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:32,212
In case you aren't familiar with the game,

27
00:01:32,212 --> 00:01:35,475
I want to show a short trailer to give you some context

28
00:01:35,475 --> 00:01:36,996
for how it feels.

29
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:47,443
What if we could all go to the woods to live?

30
00:02:39,885 --> 00:02:52,407
Good day, Henry.

31
00:03:09,547 --> 00:03:17,678
Play as Henry David Thoreau in Walden, a game.

32
00:03:21,112 --> 00:03:25,613
So the game was produced in my research lab at the University of Southern California,

33
00:03:25,613 --> 00:03:30,494
the USC Game Innovation Lab, and it's an independent game.

34
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:35,435
I should note, though, that it's also been funded by some unique sources,

35
00:03:35,435 --> 00:03:38,776
such as the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Endowment for the Arts.

36
00:03:38,776 --> 00:03:44,017
Because of that, we are able to make the game free for educators to use in their classrooms.

37
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:47,398
So in case there are any teachers in the room,

38
00:03:47,398 --> 00:03:50,658
this is where you can find out about getting copies for your classrooms.

39
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,144
So, making a game about a famous philosopher hermit is a bit crazy.

40
00:03:58,144 --> 00:03:59,845
I'm going to admit that right off the bat.

41
00:03:59,845 --> 00:04:02,727
You might just be asking yourself, why?

42
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:05,249
Why not just make a survival game?

43
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:07,991
Why make it specifically about Thoreau?

44
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:12,594
Isn't he just some stuffy old writer who, if we grew up in America, we were forced to

45
00:04:12,594 --> 00:04:13,595
read in high school?

46
00:04:14,618 --> 00:04:21,900
Well, the answer to that, for me, lies in Thoreau's philosophy itself and the rules

47
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:28,502
of the experiment in living that he set for himself down at the pond, and the possibility

48
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:34,083
those rules offer to teach us something about the wider palette of challenge and motivation

49
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:38,464
that we as game designers should consider when we're imagining novel game experiences.

50
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,403
To begin with, I want to acknowledge that Thoreau and his writing are particularly American

51
00:04:44,403 --> 00:04:45,243
in their influence.

52
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:49,265
I've actually taken the game around the world, and I've found that there are many people

53
00:04:49,265 --> 00:04:56,169
who know of him as a recluse and a hermit, but outside America, people are not assigned

54
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:59,991
to read him in the way that we are here in our literature classes.

55
00:04:59,991 --> 00:05:04,434
So usually, even if people have not read his writings, they'll still know that he went

56
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:07,976
out into the woods and lived in a cabin alone there.

57
00:05:09,216 --> 00:05:15,679
And they may actually have a connection to the theme of the book, the themes of the book

58
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:20,640
which are about finding balance in life and looking for a relationship in nature

59
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,641
because these are actually quite universal, especially today

60
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:27,703
as digital technologies spin our lives faster and faster and farther away

61
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,303
from the pace of life in nature.

62
00:05:31,176 --> 00:05:38,001
So whether or not the modern themes of living are more simply and sustainably our universal

63
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:44,345
ones, it is, I would say, a particularly American dream to want to go off into the woods and

64
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:44,906
live alone.

65
00:05:46,006 --> 00:05:49,187
to be completely self-sufficient and apart from society.

66
00:05:49,187 --> 00:05:53,649
And I know that GDC is an international audience,

67
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:57,051
so I want to address up front that yes,

68
00:05:57,051 --> 00:06:00,572
this is a strange and interesting and romantic dream, this

69
00:06:00,572 --> 00:06:03,833
iconoclastic strain of the American ideology.

70
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:08,255
And though I can't see you very well, just out of curiosity,

71
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:19,461
Who here would admit to having dreamed at one time or another of maybe going off on our own and living in a cabin, having the time to work on our own creative dreams?

72
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:24,943
Yeah, all right, okay, let's all go together, we'll make a commune.

73
00:06:24,943 --> 00:06:27,204
So I certainly have, right?

74
00:06:27,204 --> 00:06:33,186
And if you have, you probably, knowingly or unknowingly, have been influenced by the ideas

75
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:38,307
of Henry David Thoreau, who is perhaps the most famous American recluse after maybe the

76
00:06:38,307 --> 00:06:38,807
Unabomber.

77
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:47,022
So, for those who may not remember Thoreau, or weren't forced to read him,

78
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:51,245
it's just a little bit of context about him and his work.

79
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,608
As I mentioned, he was a writer and a naturalist and an activist

80
00:06:54,608 --> 00:06:57,811
who lived in the 1800s in Massachusetts in the town of Concord,

81
00:06:57,811 --> 00:07:01,094
which was also home to a group of writers and philosophers

82
00:07:01,094 --> 00:07:04,797
who would form the core of that generation of American literature.

83
00:07:04,797 --> 00:07:07,759
People like Ralph Waldo Emerson and Nathaniel Hawthorne.

84
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,697
Bronson Alcott and his daughter Louisa May Alcott,

85
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,984
sometimes joined by Margaret Fuller, Herman Melville,

86
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:16,167
and a number of others.

87
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:18,661
And Thoreau was part of this group,

88
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:20,862
but he really wasn't much of a joiner.

89
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:25,083
He preferred to be on the outskirts and go his own way.

90
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,384
His most well-known work is probably

91
00:07:27,384 --> 00:07:30,664
on civil disobedience, an essay about the importance

92
00:07:30,664 --> 00:07:33,165
of throwing our entire lives, our bodies,

93
00:07:33,165 --> 00:07:36,186
into making the kind of change that we believe in.

94
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:38,907
And this essay famously inspired leaders

95
00:07:38,907 --> 00:07:41,587
such as Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King

96
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:44,728
in their own nonviolent acts of resistance against the state.

97
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:49,572
But Thoreau himself was not a leader of movements like these men.

98
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:55,157
He was more interested in discovering a kind of personal truth, a system of living, if you will,

99
00:07:55,157 --> 00:07:59,441
that would lead him to what he perceived would be a better, more balanced life

100
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:00,622
with a direct relationship with nature.

101
00:08:00,622 --> 00:08:05,347
And he didn't think he was going to find that living in Concord, working odd jobs,

102
00:08:05,347 --> 00:08:07,869
and hanging out with a bunch of other writers talking about writing.

103
00:08:09,213 --> 00:08:11,675
So in the summer of 1845, on July 4th, Independence Day,

104
00:08:11,675 --> 00:08:15,397
he went out into the woods near Concord and built a cabin

105
00:08:15,397 --> 00:08:19,220
and lived there for two years, two months, and two days

106
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,581
in pursuit of an idea about how he could best

107
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:23,002
spend his time in life.

108
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,823
He wanted to strip down his life to its bare minimum

109
00:08:25,823 --> 00:08:27,985
so that he could judge what was really necessary

110
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:31,087
and what was superfluous, what was distracting him

111
00:08:31,087 --> 00:08:33,328
from really understanding the essence of life.

112
00:08:34,322 --> 00:08:37,904
Thoreau called what he was doing an experiment in living.

113
00:08:37,904 --> 00:08:40,205
But from a game designer's point of view, to me,

114
00:08:40,205 --> 00:08:43,047
it really feels a lot like a game he was playing.

115
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:46,689
The rules were, survive on as little as possible,

116
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:49,870
learn ways to optimize your time spent on survival,

117
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:53,412
and invest that time into discovering the secrets of nature.

118
00:08:53,412 --> 00:08:55,933
Maintain as high a connection to nature as possible

119
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:57,394
without failing at survival.

120
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:02,430
The natural resistance in the system was twofold.

121
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,350
First, time itself is limited.

122
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,151
And second, even if you cut yourself off

123
00:09:07,151 --> 00:09:10,052
from society physically, your relationships

124
00:09:10,052 --> 00:09:13,512
will make demands on you whether you like it or not.

125
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,133
In Thoreau's case, he did not divorce himself

126
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:18,173
from society entirely.

127
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:21,014
So he kind of set himself apart from it

128
00:09:21,014 --> 00:09:22,574
within walking distance.

129
00:09:22,574 --> 00:09:25,215
So these demands actually took more time

130
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:26,915
than we might imagine for someone

131
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:28,896
who we think of as a hermit living out there

132
00:09:28,896 --> 00:09:29,196
in those woods.

133
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:34,301
Now, I've actually spent a lot of time elsewhere talking about my personal reasons for choosing

134
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:37,344
this book and this writer to make a game about.

135
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:41,388
I'm not going to go into that here, but if you're interested in my personal connection

136
00:09:41,388 --> 00:09:45,032
to Thoreau and the journey of ten years of production, I'd suggest watching this talk.

137
00:09:45,592 --> 00:09:49,154
from IndieCade, which is all about that.

138
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:50,994
Today, what I'd like to talk about

139
00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:54,276
is how non-traditional Thoreau's game design was,

140
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:58,217
how he set different motivations for himself as a player,

141
00:09:58,217 --> 00:09:59,858
and how basing a video game

142
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:02,319
on this non-traditional set of motivations

143
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:05,060
can produce a very different kind of experience for players.

144
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:11,080
As I mentioned earlier, Thoreau wanted to strip down his life into the barest essentials.

145
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,702
He decided for himself these were food, fuel, shelter, and clothing.

146
00:10:14,702 --> 00:10:18,564
He lived in the northeast part of America where there are pretty brutal winters, so

147
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:23,546
things like shelter and warmth were more critical than if he'd lived somewhere else.

148
00:10:23,546 --> 00:10:31,209
But these basic necessaries of life, as he calls them, are key motivators for him.

149
00:10:31,689 --> 00:10:33,891
He spent a lot of time providing for them,

150
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:35,692
especially at first before he learned

151
00:10:35,692 --> 00:10:38,235
to kind of optimize his survival needs.

152
00:10:38,235 --> 00:10:40,176
And this is something that we can relate to

153
00:10:40,176 --> 00:10:43,499
in designing basic survival simulations in many games.

154
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:45,701
We often find ourselves creating systems

155
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:47,442
for maintaining player health and strength.

156
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,263
But Thoreau did not want to maintain health and strength so that he could go off into battle,

157
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:57,486
or even fight natural enemies like wolves or bears.

158
00:10:57,486 --> 00:11:01,649
Instead, the challenge he set for himself was to battle time.

159
00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:08,255
He wanted to optimize his survival needs in such a way as to give himself more time to spend exploring the woods.

160
00:11:08,595 --> 00:11:13,396
interacting with nature at all levels, and gaining inspiration from those interactions.

161
00:11:13,396 --> 00:11:19,597
He used this inspiration to write pages upon pages and pages of notes in his journal,

162
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:24,838
ideas about what he saw and thought each day, and how his life and nature differed from the

163
00:11:24,838 --> 00:11:31,159
life of his fellow men. The reward for Thoreau was not better clothes or a nicer home or even

164
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:35,200
better tools. His reward was a wealth of ideas and experience.

165
00:11:36,118 --> 00:11:38,620
So this is where, in the design of Walled in a Game,

166
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,583
we had to diverge completely from a standard survival game.

167
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:45,626
Once you figured out how to maintain yourself in the woods,

168
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:48,488
the idea now is not how to level up your house and tools

169
00:11:48,488 --> 00:11:52,752
or build yourself up as a warrior survivor,

170
00:11:52,752 --> 00:11:54,614
but rather to build yourself up

171
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:56,976
as a lover of nature and the world.

172
00:11:57,356 --> 00:12:02,663
And in fact, in the game, if you fall into the trap of working too much on your survival,

173
00:12:02,663 --> 00:12:08,029
which we absolutely allow you to do, you will find that your life in the woods grows dim

174
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:12,775
and uninteresting. The possibility of the space will literally close down,

175
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:16,300
visually, orally, and in terms of the interactive opportunities.

176
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:20,856
Many players don't realize this is happening right away

177
00:12:20,856 --> 00:12:23,598
because they've been trained by virtually all other games

178
00:12:23,598 --> 00:12:26,099
that there's only one true path in life,

179
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:31,542
one core set of motivations that games mirror exactly.

180
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:35,364
This belief that more is better, more food, more fuel,

181
00:12:35,364 --> 00:12:38,806
more shelter, better shelter, better clothes,

182
00:12:38,806 --> 00:12:41,087
all of these make for a better life.

183
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,108
And the value of riches and success

184
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:44,669
are unquestioned in players' minds

185
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:47,111
because most games reward that assumption.

186
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:49,713
If you make a game where more is better,

187
00:12:49,713 --> 00:12:52,595
leveling up is good, players feel a sense of comfort

188
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:55,317
with that and their expectations about what they are

189
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:58,099
supposed to be doing in your game confirm

190
00:12:58,099 --> 00:13:00,461
what they believe about life in general.

191
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:03,703
So if your game has no other aim than to make people

192
00:13:03,703 --> 00:13:06,746
feel comfortable and confirm their general assumptions

193
00:13:06,746 --> 00:13:10,949
about life in a kind of acquisitionist context,

194
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:11,249
this is fine.

195
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,432
But Thoreau's experiment was about disproving

196
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:16,013
these assumed constants.

197
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:20,709
His philosophy was directed towards a different and more elusive goal.

198
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:25,311
And because we wanted our player experience in Walden to reflect and

199
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:30,033
in fact embody that difference, we needed a motivation system that would

200
00:13:30,033 --> 00:13:33,175
subtly lead players away from standard game goals.

201
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:38,400
and those rewards and towards the kind of questioning that had originally inspired the

202
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:38,640
rote.

203
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:45,747
We needed to make a game about a unique philosopher exploring the outcomes of an experiment and

204
00:13:45,747 --> 00:13:47,869
living under his own special rule set.

205
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:52,633
A traditional motivation and reward system would not suffice.

206
00:13:53,524 --> 00:13:59,430
We had to refer to mechanics like wealth and acquisition, resource management, item collection,

207
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:05,076
leveling up and the like, allowing players to earn money with odd jobs, farming or selling

208
00:14:05,076 --> 00:14:09,161
your manuscripts and then using the money you earn to buy better tools or fancy fishing

209
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:13,926
rods or more food storage or even leveling up your shelter with a nice iron cook stove.

210
00:14:14,547 --> 00:14:18,029
But these gestures to traditional game motivation structures and

211
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:23,031
really to traditional life goals are a trap in the game.

212
00:14:23,031 --> 00:14:27,514
They don't lead to the ultimate prize of play,

213
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:30,115
which was, as Thoreau would have it, a life well lived.

214
00:14:31,865 --> 00:14:36,867
What generally happens in the game is that at a certain point, all of a player's inspiration

215
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:41,829
has drained away as they have focused on attaining more things or responding to the demands of

216
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:46,952
NPC friends, family, and colleagues who have literally chased after you out into the woods

217
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:50,293
and demanded that you participate in traditional social structures.

218
00:14:50,877 --> 00:14:54,502
Your mentor Emerson wants you to keep writing and selling your manuscripts.

219
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:58,747
Your family wants financial aid, financial help with paying their bills,

220
00:14:58,747 --> 00:15:02,953
and emotional support, help grieving their personal losses.

221
00:15:02,953 --> 00:15:06,678
And the government wants you to pay your taxes like a decent member of society.

222
00:15:08,048 --> 00:15:10,149
And you can do all these things in the game

223
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:12,310
if you think that that's right.

224
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:15,492
And there may even be small rewards for you along the way

225
00:15:15,492 --> 00:15:17,393
by participating in these to-do items.

226
00:15:17,393 --> 00:15:20,495
But the bigger prize for you as a player

227
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:23,276
lies in balancing your time between your goals

228
00:15:23,276 --> 00:15:27,058
of self-sufficient survival and a constant, deep relationship

229
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:29,580
with nature and the inspiration it provides.

230
00:15:30,745 --> 00:15:35,329
Only by working constantly to sustain this balance will you find yourself both strong

231
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:40,473
and healthy and able to have the time to explore and reflect on nature.

232
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:44,997
And only by sustaining this balance will you have the opportunity to fill your in-game

233
00:15:44,997 --> 00:15:47,279
journal with ideas and inspirations.

234
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,123
The very ideas and inspirations that will allow you, playing as Thoreau, to finally

235
00:15:52,123 --> 00:15:53,424
write the book that is Walden.

236
00:15:55,301 --> 00:16:00,466
One thing we absolutely wanted to avoid in the game was one single win scenario.

237
00:16:00,466 --> 00:16:06,172
When you're making a game about a philosopher who set out to challenge common wisdom about what makes life successful,

238
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:10,816
it seems very wrong to provide a prescriptive and singular win scenario for players.

239
00:16:10,816 --> 00:16:17,783
So we made it possible for players to complete the game in a number of ways that may or may not align with Thoreau's own beliefs,

240
00:16:17,783 --> 00:16:19,524
while at the same time providing perhaps

241
00:16:19,805 --> 00:16:25,050
the greatest sense of achievement for those who do realize the real optimization here

242
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,093
is about managing time and balancing their basic and their more ephemeral needs.

243
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,489
So while one of the different outcomes of the games

244
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:35,271
includes becoming a famous writer

245
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:36,733
and earning substantial paychecks

246
00:16:36,733 --> 00:16:38,314
from your editor in New York,

247
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:39,956
traveling to Boston to lecture

248
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:41,658
on your experiences in the woods,

249
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:44,821
to do this you would actually need to break

250
00:16:44,821 --> 00:16:46,422
with your goals of self-sufficiency

251
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,385
and buy things like a fashionable suit

252
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:50,887
in order to go and do that lecture.

253
00:16:51,587 --> 00:16:55,470
Other paths include helping your mentor, Emerson, with his own writing.

254
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:00,174
Seeking out books for the lectures that he's working on will also inspire you.

255
00:17:00,174 --> 00:17:04,497
So there's some efficiency here since your goals are aligned with Emerson's.

256
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:09,340
But there's maybe a growing sense that you need to stop doing his bidding

257
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,462
and get back to your own experiment in the woods.

258
00:17:12,082 --> 00:17:17,345
You may also take on surveying jobs in the woods, which at first probably seems like an excellent compromise,

259
00:17:17,345 --> 00:17:21,668
since you wind up spending a lot of time tramping around in nature, exploring,

260
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:25,990
while earning money you can spend on food and such in the general store.

261
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:32,154
But surveying is a tool of commercial development, and as you participate in the breaking up of the woods into parcels,

262
00:17:32,154 --> 00:17:36,256
you may find that you've become a servant to the needs of an expanding society,

263
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,457
and are no longer living by your own principles.

264
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,692
Following Thoreau's passion as an amateur naturalist,

265
00:17:42,692 --> 00:17:45,234
you may also spend your time capturing specimens

266
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:46,975
of the wild animals you find in the woods

267
00:17:46,975 --> 00:17:49,076
to contribute to the annals of science.

268
00:17:49,076 --> 00:17:51,438
This can earn you both a bit of money

269
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,160
and some obscure credits in a scientific publication.

270
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,962
Again, there is a question of whether you're

271
00:17:56,962 --> 00:18:00,365
following the true prize, taking financial reward from nature

272
00:18:00,365 --> 00:18:01,606
rather than inspiration.

273
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:03,788
And these are just a few of the possible paths

274
00:18:03,788 --> 00:18:05,629
you might follow over the course of the game.

275
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:11,749
The open world design of Walden contains within it an extremely broad possibility space for

276
00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:17,952
players to explore this basic question about how best we, or Thoreau in this case, can

277
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:19,372
spend our time.

278
00:18:19,372 --> 00:18:23,554
If we choose to focus purely on survival, we will never achieve the larger goal of living

279
00:18:23,554 --> 00:18:24,535
an inspired life.

280
00:18:24,955 --> 00:18:26,535
If we choose to focus purely on inspiration,

281
00:18:26,535 --> 00:18:29,737
we will lose strength and faint away.

282
00:18:29,737 --> 00:18:32,038
If we take our direction from the various requests

283
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:33,698
that others place on us,

284
00:18:33,698 --> 00:18:37,800
we may find some of what we are looking for, but not all.

285
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,982
It is up to each player to discover in our own way

286
00:18:40,982 --> 00:18:43,523
our own final reward, which in this case,

287
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:46,924
in this game, actually lies beyond the screen.

288
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:49,485
And that's because the most important thing

289
00:18:49,485 --> 00:18:52,367
about game design that I learned from Thoreau in a nutshell,

290
00:18:52,938 --> 00:18:57,360
after spending 10 years making a game about a book that he spent 10 years writing, is

291
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:57,440
this.

292
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,183
People want all the wrong things.

293
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:04,725
We think we want to be successful, but we really want to be accepted.

294
00:19:04,725 --> 00:19:08,107
And we think we want freedom, but we really want security.

295
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:14,030
We are conflicted beings, and we are easily distracted from what we really need by what

296
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,751
we've been trained to believe that we need.

297
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:21,340
Game players, specifically, have been trained to believe they need rewards,

298
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:26,282
that they need to win, and that they need external motivation to tell them what to do next.

299
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:28,583
And to some extent, that is clearly true.

300
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,464
We all need some guidance to help us along.

301
00:19:30,464 --> 00:19:35,646
But we don't need nearly as much guidance as we think we do, in games or in life.

302
00:19:36,086 --> 00:19:40,312
What Thoreau is writing about, and what we were trying to provide in Walden,

303
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,435
with our very different kind of survival simulation,

304
00:19:42,435 --> 00:19:46,780
is that sometimes we need experiences that untrain us,

305
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,866
that challenge us to upend our assumptions about what we should be striving for.

306
00:19:52,497 --> 00:19:54,539
And so in a lot of ways, Walled in a Game

307
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,181
is an attempt to untrain players.

308
00:19:56,181 --> 00:19:59,824
It uses the basic design language of survival mechanics

309
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:03,607
combined with a subversive set of non-survival mechanics, i.e.,

310
00:20:03,607 --> 00:20:06,690
inspiration opportunities, and a possibility space

311
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,972
threaded with quests that may or may not

312
00:20:08,972 --> 00:20:11,614
align with the goal of balancing these mechanics.

313
00:20:11,614 --> 00:20:13,916
And it frames this experience as a narrative

314
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,078
about a historical character whose

315
00:20:16,078 --> 00:20:19,221
life is a symbol of American individualism and free thought.

316
00:20:21,174 --> 00:20:24,157
That's a lot to put on the shoulders of an indie game.

317
00:20:24,157 --> 00:20:26,419
It expects quite a lot from our players

318
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:29,262
in terms of self-reflection during play,

319
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,944
and the ability to parse meaning from game mechanics,

320
00:20:31,944 --> 00:20:35,207
and a kind of literacy about meaningfulness in play.

321
00:20:35,207 --> 00:20:38,430
It assumes literacy with more than common traditional game

322
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,973
mechanics, and a willingness on the part of players

323
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,776
to accept that those mechanics are only one way of abstracting

324
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:45,937
how the world works.

325
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:52,742
If a player can recognize the difference between what is asked of them in a traditional survival game, for example, in Walden,

326
00:20:52,742 --> 00:20:55,784
and what is asked of them in life in Walden,

327
00:20:55,784 --> 00:21:00,647
they may make a connection that equals the philosophical discoveries of Thoreau.

328
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:01,988
In short, they may win our game.

329
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:09,950
Quite frankly, this level of literacy is as rare in game players as it is in readers of

330
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,071
literature.

331
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:15,134
To play and discern abstract meaning from that play is a beautiful thing.

332
00:21:15,134 --> 00:21:20,278
But we as designers don't really train players to engage at that level.

333
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:22,999
We don't expect it of them that regularly.

334
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:29,544
In the same way that we first learn to read with literal meaning and to see with representational

335
00:21:29,544 --> 00:21:33,006
meaning, we also first learn to play without abstraction.

336
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:38,874
But there is a beauty in reading play abstractly that if we as designers begin to build into

337
00:21:38,874 --> 00:21:44,961
our systems of engagement, we may find ourselves able to express entirely new systems of ideas.

338
00:21:44,961 --> 00:21:49,828
Systems of ideas that go beyond acquisition and accomplishment as universal signifiers

339
00:21:49,828 --> 00:21:50,569
of success.

340
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:56,278
Systems of ideas that may lead us and our players away from traditional assumptions

341
00:21:56,278 --> 00:21:58,943
about what motivates us in play and in life.

342
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:04,973
And systems of ideas that allow us to express alternative philosophies as playful experiences.

343
00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:08,448
Before I conclude, I want to address one last thing,

344
00:22:08,448 --> 00:22:10,529
and that is that many people, when

345
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,090
they hear that I've made a video game about living in nature

346
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,811
and specifically about Thoreau, the famous curmudgeon

347
00:22:15,811 --> 00:22:18,932
hermit of Walden Woods, they conclude immediately

348
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:21,613
that this is too ironic to be true.

349
00:22:21,613 --> 00:22:23,233
And I understand this impulse.

350
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,554
I made a video game about a guy who

351
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:28,275
exclaimed to all that we need to simplify our lives.

352
00:22:29,603 --> 00:22:31,105
But here's the thing.

353
00:22:31,105 --> 00:22:32,906
He's a guy who wrote a book about it,

354
00:22:32,906 --> 00:22:35,928
which was the technology of expression of his time.

355
00:22:35,928 --> 00:22:37,430
All media is a technology.

356
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,312
Words, images, mechanics, these are all technologies

357
00:22:40,312 --> 00:22:41,973
of ideas and expression.

358
00:22:41,973 --> 00:22:44,175
So part of me says, no, it's not at all ironic

359
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:46,757
to use the media of our time to express

360
00:22:46,757 --> 00:22:49,599
these universal questions about how we spend

361
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:51,061
our time in the world.

362
00:22:51,061 --> 00:22:53,823
If anything, asking these questions in a video game

363
00:22:53,823 --> 00:22:55,464
is the most pertinent place for us

364
00:22:55,464 --> 00:22:56,905
to experience them these days.

365
00:22:58,122 --> 00:23:02,505
The real question is, do we know as players and as designers

366
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:05,367
how to understand the non-traditional philosophies

367
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:07,689
embodied in this playful system?

368
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:11,231
Do we know how to play and how to design deliberately?

369
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:15,334
I think I might have a few minutes for questions

370
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:16,034
if there are any.

371
00:23:26,846 --> 00:23:30,795
So Walden, sorry not Walden, Thoreau,

372
00:23:30,795 --> 00:23:32,680
brought his laundry home to his mother

373
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,943
so she could do it for him.

374
00:23:33,943 --> 00:23:35,086
Can you do that in the game?

375
00:23:35,803 --> 00:23:37,044
Yes, in fact, you can.

376
00:23:37,044 --> 00:23:40,027
The question is, can you get your laundry done

377
00:23:40,027 --> 00:23:41,088
by your mother in the game?

378
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:45,072
And yes, in fact, we have an option for you to go home

379
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:47,274
and not only have your mother do your laundry,

380
00:23:47,274 --> 00:23:49,997
but she's also possibly sometimes baked you a pie,

381
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:50,638
so you can have pie.

382
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:54,902
You can actually live in town, do odd jobs,

383
00:23:54,902 --> 00:23:56,844
and spend most of your time in Concord

384
00:23:56,844 --> 00:23:59,187
if you would like to become a Concord slacker.

385
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:04,742
If you were going to spend the next 10 years of your life making a game about a different

386
00:24:04,742 --> 00:24:06,782
philosophy, what would you choose?

387
00:24:06,782 --> 00:24:09,943
Wow, that's really a wonderful question.

388
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:12,664
My next game is actually not about someone else.

389
00:24:12,664 --> 00:24:17,645
My next game is a personal game that I'm working on, so I don't have a ready answer for you.

390
00:24:17,645 --> 00:24:22,967
Right now I'm kind of embroiled in understanding how to make a game about something that is

391
00:24:22,967 --> 00:24:25,688
kind of deeply personal to me.

392
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:29,609
Wow, I've got to think about that one and get back to you.

393
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:35,799
Thank you very much. It was a very interesting talk.

394
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:45,242
My question is, when you're talking about that players follow the standard path of levelling up everything,

395
00:24:45,242 --> 00:24:50,704
that you will be reducing the space of possibilities of nature.

396
00:24:51,404 --> 00:24:54,626
And also I've seen that something about inspiration,

397
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:59,249
and I was wondering how is any like measure of that,

398
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:01,970
that the player is aware of it, so he can increase,

399
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,932
or is just there and experience it.

400
00:25:04,932 --> 00:25:05,932
Good question, yes.

401
00:25:05,932 --> 00:25:09,835
So the way that we do that is, I mentioned,

402
00:25:09,835 --> 00:25:11,536
I guess I was being pretty vague,

403
00:25:11,536 --> 00:25:12,997
but yes, visually and orally.

404
00:25:12,997 --> 00:25:15,878
So inspiration is denoted in the game

405
00:25:15,878 --> 00:25:18,380
through the richness of the world,

406
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,201
the actual, the colors of the world.

407
00:25:20,681 --> 00:25:28,623
but also the number of instruments in the music score.

408
00:25:28,623 --> 00:25:31,924
So whole lines of the melody will fall out

409
00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:33,564
as you become less and less inspired,

410
00:25:33,564 --> 00:25:35,664
and the world becomes more dim.

411
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:39,245
You start to lose the saturation,

412
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:39,865
and it becomes very dull.

413
00:25:39,865 --> 00:25:44,106
And you could get down to just a very, not quite black and white,

414
00:25:44,106 --> 00:25:49,548
but a very dull experience with just a heartbeat of music going.

415
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,008
And.

416
00:25:50,928 --> 00:25:56,771
A lot of times people don't feel like, they're not aware of it immediately, but

417
00:25:56,771 --> 00:25:59,232
when they talk to you about their experience, they'll say, well,

418
00:25:59,232 --> 00:26:00,993
I was just feeling really depressed.

419
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:04,554
And then I just decided maybe I should go take a walk by the water.

420
00:26:04,554 --> 00:26:08,676
And then all of a sudden, the music came back and I started feeling better.

421
00:26:08,676 --> 00:26:12,738
And we tried to make it so that it wasn't a meter, right?

422
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,139
Because we didn't want a meter of inspiration.

423
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:22,767
But we wanted to have a more subtle kind of system that allowed you to feel when your

424
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:23,788
inspiration was rising.

425
00:26:25,803 --> 00:26:27,024
Hi, it was a great talk.

426
00:26:27,024 --> 00:26:31,048
So kind of going off of that question,

427
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:34,290
are there specific ways for players

428
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:36,392
to self-reflect in the game?

429
00:26:36,392 --> 00:26:40,336
Like you said, players say that I took a walk by the lake.

430
00:26:40,336 --> 00:26:43,399
Was that like when you asked the players

431
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:46,461
or is there also a way for them to self-reflect in the game?

432
00:26:46,461 --> 00:26:47,883
Did you design for that in any way?

433
00:26:48,103 --> 00:26:52,024
We didn't design a way for them to record it within the game, but the game is paced...

434
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:54,165
Sorry, I'm not repeating the questions.

435
00:26:54,165 --> 00:27:00,908
The question is, are there ways for the players to self-reflect in the game system?

436
00:27:00,908 --> 00:27:02,308
There's two things.

437
00:27:02,308 --> 00:27:02,988
One is...

438
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:08,790
the journal, which isn't a self-reflection, it's really a collection of everything you've done in the game.

439
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:14,111
So everything you've looked at and inspected closely will fill your journal in a kind of procedural

440
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:15,731
list of

441
00:27:15,731 --> 00:27:18,212
like your notes of your experience.

442
00:27:18,212 --> 00:27:25,153
But then we also just designed the game, just quite frankly, to be paced so that there's a lot of time for reflection.

443
00:27:25,594 --> 00:27:27,916
There's even time for reflection when you're doing

444
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:29,877
your basic survival tasks.

445
00:27:29,877 --> 00:27:32,760
I don't know about you, but when you're doing things

446
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,622
like physical labor, like hammering, right,

447
00:27:35,622 --> 00:27:38,825
or sawing or something, there's actually quite a lot

448
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:41,927
of time for thinking, and the same with walking.

449
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:43,488
There's a lot of walking in this game,

450
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,031
and we wanted to have that time there

451
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:48,593
so that players could be reflecting

452
00:27:48,593 --> 00:27:52,015
as they were engaged in these more mundane tasks

453
00:27:52,015 --> 00:27:53,216
of Thoreau's life.

454
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,882
Fascinating talk, thank you.

455
00:27:57,882 --> 00:28:00,505
Could you share a little bit more about the response

456
00:28:00,505 --> 00:28:03,329
from players, did people generally kind of get it,

457
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:06,634
and do you consider this successful?

458
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:08,717
How do you think about success for a game like this?

459
00:28:09,432 --> 00:28:10,753
That's a great question.

460
00:28:10,753 --> 00:28:12,154
So there's a lot of different metrics for us.

461
00:28:12,154 --> 00:28:15,877
The first is that what I've noticed

462
00:28:15,877 --> 00:28:19,260
is that we have a core group of players who really get it.

463
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,603
And when they get it, I mean, they love it.

464
00:28:22,603 --> 00:28:28,828
There's just a kind of excitement and appreciation.

465
00:28:28,828 --> 00:28:32,451
And people often write me very long letters about.

466
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:39,343
almost like a journal entry about the things that happen to them in the game, the story of their experience and how they

467
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:45,855
Usually there's an epiphany along the way and they tell me the story of how they reach their particular epiphany, right?

468
00:28:47,332 --> 00:28:51,194
So that to me, number one, that's a success.

469
00:28:51,194 --> 00:28:52,315
We found our players.

470
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:55,458
It's never going to be a broad commercial game,

471
00:28:55,458 --> 00:28:58,760
but we have obviously released it on commercial platforms.

472
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,663
And I would say that it's done uniquely well

473
00:29:02,663 --> 00:29:04,905
for an academic research game,

474
00:29:04,905 --> 00:29:09,749
because it was like the top seller on itch.io last year,

475
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:12,051
which is a small distribution platform,

476
00:29:12,051 --> 00:29:14,092
but that's still really nice to be able to say.

477
00:29:14,913 --> 00:29:16,693
and now we're coming to Steam.

478
00:29:16,693 --> 00:29:20,095
We'll see how they treat us.

479
00:29:20,095 --> 00:29:22,597
Also on PlayStation we have some people

480
00:29:22,597 --> 00:29:25,158
who've even created a little players community

481
00:29:25,158 --> 00:29:26,539
which I was sort of like, oh my god,

482
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:27,399
they've created a bunch of.

483
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,152
They're playing together.

484
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:33,133
So those are really nice.

485
00:29:33,133 --> 00:29:36,896
The other side of the metric is not commercial,

486
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:42,421
and it's not even just core players.

487
00:29:42,421 --> 00:29:44,983
And that is educational.

488
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:48,506
So I mentioned we give the game away to teachers.

489
00:29:49,006 --> 00:29:53,930
And the love of the teachers and the stories that we hear from students

490
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:58,394
in encountering this game in classrooms is pretty extreme.

491
00:29:58,394 --> 00:30:03,018
It's pretty great because it's a real game.

492
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:07,783
It's not something trying to shove educational content into a small amount

493
00:30:07,783 --> 00:30:11,506
of time, it's a real experiential open world game.

494
00:30:12,547 --> 00:30:19,169
The students really love that it's a full 3D immersive world.

495
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:26,272
They really love that this doesn't smell like an educational game for them.

496
00:30:26,272 --> 00:30:29,513
So we've received quite a lot of praise that way.

497
00:30:29,513 --> 00:30:32,655
We've also won some awards, so that obviously is a nice pat on the back.

498
00:30:32,655 --> 00:30:38,817
While your game is complex, have you ever gotten comparisons with a game,

499
00:30:38,817 --> 00:30:40,758
like one of the older games, Journey?

500
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:46,143
just the way it feels going through, just exploring on a peaceful premise?

501
00:30:46,143 --> 00:30:48,645
Well sure, yeah. So Genova was one of my students.

502
00:30:48,645 --> 00:30:56,773
And of course we have very similar aesthetics.

503
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:57,614
I would say

504
00:30:57,614 --> 00:30:57,914
absolutely.

505
00:31:02,058 --> 00:31:04,402
I think that's probably time.

506
00:31:04,402 --> 00:31:06,785
I'm not certain exactly when we're supposed to end.

507
00:31:06,785 --> 00:31:08,969
But if there are no more questions,

00:31:08,969 --> 00:31:10,952
