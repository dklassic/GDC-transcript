1
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:11,725
to bringing fantasy to life in Final Fantasy 15. If you're looking for bringing hell to life,

2
00:00:11,725 --> 00:00:16,069
you're in the wrong room. That's in 2002. I'm not even making that up. That's going on right

3
00:00:16,069 --> 00:00:17,851
now. So, uh, my name is Dan Inouye.

4
00:00:18,729 --> 00:00:20,270
I'll give you a quick background on me.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,012
I was born and raised in New York,

6
00:00:22,012 --> 00:00:24,474
and I bounced back and forth to Japan for a while

7
00:00:24,474 --> 00:00:27,376
before landing at Square Enix about 12 years ago.

8
00:00:27,376 --> 00:00:28,777
And for the last couple years,

9
00:00:28,777 --> 00:00:30,518
I've been leading the team responsible

10
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:34,121
for the English language content in Final Fantasy XV

11
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:36,563
and its companion projects.

12
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:39,105
I'll warn you up front that there are spoilers ahead,

13
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:41,647
but there's also a section on why the spoilers

14
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:44,450
don't really spoil anything, so I hope you'll stick with me.

15
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,752
And we'll start with Final Fantasy.

16
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,483
So I'm guessing everyone here kind of has an idea

17
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:54,586
and has heard of Final Fantasy, but what is it?

18
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:57,569
For 30 years, Final Fantasy has reinvented itself

19
00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:00,592
and rebuilt itself anew with each iteration.

20
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:03,615
So every time it's new characters, new worlds, new gameplay.

21
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:10,198
new combat, often fabulous hair, but it's never the same game. So what defines a Final Fantasy

22
00:01:10,198 --> 00:01:16,061
game? Well, one answer is it's lore. More precisely, the way the lore of each entry kind of

23
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:21,404
co-ops monsters and magic and mythos from different traditions. You have the Babylonian next

24
00:01:21,404 --> 00:01:26,247
to the Celtic, next to the Chinese, next to Greek mythology, without any regard for the dogmatic

25
00:01:26,247 --> 00:01:31,170
baggage that comes with it. So Final Fantasy kind of draws on these for inspiration without

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,130
any limitations.

27
00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:37,956
And so many, many years ago when this project began,

28
00:01:37,956 --> 00:01:39,537
it was built on a simple premise,

29
00:01:39,537 --> 00:01:41,819
a fantasy based on reality,

30
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:43,400
which is a significant proposition

31
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,963
because reality has never really been the series' focus.

32
00:01:46,963 --> 00:01:51,967
So of course, all fiction is to some extent based on reality.

33
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:54,629
On the surface, the intent here was a modern take,

34
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:57,831
sort of a real-world setting with touches of high fantasy.

35
00:01:57,831 --> 00:02:00,333
But in time, with the companion projects and promotion,

36
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,415
it added an extra dimension of reality

37
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:02,775
and

38
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,238
the project kind of developed a life of its own.

39
00:02:05,238 --> 00:02:09,062
So at the core of everything is the game,

40
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:12,646
which follows Prince Noctis and his three close friends

41
00:02:12,646 --> 00:02:14,388
as they leave home on a journey.

42
00:02:14,388 --> 00:02:17,792
It begins with an open-world exploration of the continent

43
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:19,934
and then gradually assumes a linear format

44
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:21,476
as the story progresses.

45
00:02:23,564 --> 00:02:26,087
The film, Kingsglaive, recounts the events

46
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:29,069
that unfold in the crowned city as the prince is away,

47
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,253
centering around his father, the king, his paramour, Luna,

48
00:02:32,253 --> 00:02:35,476
and the titular Kingsglaive, the defenders of the city.

49
00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:38,519
So the film was released about a month, sorry,

50
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,102
a couple months ahead of the game's release in theaters,

51
00:02:42,102 --> 00:02:44,685
and the events of the film occur parallel

52
00:02:44,685 --> 00:02:46,387
to the first chapter of the game.

53
00:02:48,036 --> 00:02:51,877
The anime, Brotherhood, references the bond

54
00:02:51,877 --> 00:02:53,878
between the prince and his friends.

55
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:56,939
So as hinted at in the panels here,

56
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:59,720
the story opens with the gang on the road

57
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,742
and then tells the story through flashbacks

58
00:03:03,742 --> 00:03:04,642
from their boyhood.

59
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,163
So the series began streaming on YouTube

60
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:10,704
roughly a half year before the game's release

61
00:03:10,704 --> 00:03:13,225
with one episode each month in five installments.

62
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:18,449
So these weren't kind of thinly related spin-offs

63
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:20,231
or throwaway side stories.

64
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:23,875
These were threads of a simultaneous narrative

65
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,097
woven together across media.

66
00:03:26,097 --> 00:03:28,279
We couldn't assume everyone in our audience

67
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:30,401
had seen all the companion projects

68
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:31,582
or even any for that matter.

69
00:03:31,582 --> 00:03:34,405
So this represented a big challenge,

70
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:37,328
building integrated yet independent narratives

71
00:03:37,328 --> 00:03:39,630
and forming a coherent and cohesive reality.

72
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,120
So that's the intro, and with that in mind,

73
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,403
here's the breakdown of this talk, as told in three acts.

74
00:03:46,403 --> 00:03:49,986
First, I'll start off by introducing some of the tactics

75
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:52,769
and techniques we use to bring realism into our work,

76
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,692
and in the second act, I'll discuss how realities

77
00:03:56,692 --> 00:03:59,995
of development and promotion got in the way of these plans,

78
00:03:59,995 --> 00:04:02,337
and finally, we'll wrap it up with some observation

79
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:03,458
about what it all means.

80
00:04:05,843 --> 00:04:08,946
So, Act 1 is the best laid plans.

81
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:14,731
So on any project, our first task is to anchor our reality in our static material, our setting,

82
00:04:14,731 --> 00:04:16,213
our characters, and our lore.

83
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:22,699
Final Fantasy is a Japanese-developed franchise, but the reality basis meant it was more important

84
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,863
than ever that we ask ourselves, how would this be done in the West when making our linguistic

85
00:04:26,863 --> 00:04:27,383
choices?

86
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:32,155
One thing that made this Final Fantasy different from others

87
00:04:32,155 --> 00:04:35,518
also was the fact that it was set to launch simultaneously

88
00:04:35,518 --> 00:04:35,998
in 12 languages.

89
00:04:35,998 --> 00:04:39,360
As there would be no lead time to perform

90
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,122
the usual localization tweaks,

91
00:04:41,122 --> 00:04:45,545
it meant that the game had to be global from the ground up.

92
00:04:45,545 --> 00:04:48,627
So just as the ecology and nature of the game

93
00:04:48,627 --> 00:04:52,130
borrowed from real world sources, so would the cultures.

94
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:58,266
So the world of Eos features four distinct civilizations

95
00:04:58,266 --> 00:05:00,348
with their own architecture, lifestyles,

96
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:01,869
and written languages.

97
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:04,571
Pictured here is Altissia, the walls of water.

98
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,493
It's sort of a reimagined Venice,

99
00:05:06,493 --> 00:05:08,215
and in line with that flavor,

100
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:10,957
our Italian translation team was called on

101
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:14,060
to help in naming the locales and helping with the signage.

102
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:20,163
Here we see a scene from The Continent which uses English as a base with sort of French

103
00:05:20,163 --> 00:05:21,744
and Gaelic leaning spellings.

104
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:28,527
Now normally localizing art assets is unwise and a headache and most fantasy games rightly

105
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:31,108
opt to use iconography or illegible text.

106
00:05:31,888 --> 00:05:36,889
But one of the kind of benefits and luxuries of having a multicultural, multilingual in-house

107
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:42,430
translation staff is that it let us review things early on so that we could globalize

108
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:47,872
them and incorporating this sort of semi-real world languages into the world helped build

109
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:52,313
that road trip aesthetic and make the trip familiarly foreign for all audiences.

110
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,795
And so I have just a quick aside here,

111
00:05:54,795 --> 00:05:56,856
which is that I want to stress the importance

112
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,958
of consulting native speakers

113
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,300
when working with foreign cultures,

114
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,062
especially when in real world

115
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,703
or real world based fictional settings,

116
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:07,025
because especially when shows or games...

117
00:06:08,086 --> 00:06:09,866
kind of, they do the Japanese season

118
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:11,227
and they use the Japanese setting.

119
00:06:11,227 --> 00:06:13,287
It's usually laughably inauthentic

120
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:15,547
and I realize that stories cater more

121
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:19,488
to people's perceptions than they do necessarily realities

122
00:06:19,488 --> 00:06:22,249
but it's 2017 and the internet will call you out.

123
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,929
You will be exposed.

124
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:25,909
So be sure to ask a native speaker

125
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:27,289
when you're working in another culture.

126
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:29,990
So next up, this also goes to that point

127
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:35,391
on the divide between perception and reality.

128
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:41,097
While we added plenty of uniform local color to the continent of Lucis, the English-speaking

129
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:47,004
continent, this wouldn't fit with the kind of modern metropolis of its capital, the crown

130
00:06:47,004 --> 00:06:47,285
city.

131
00:06:49,453 --> 00:06:51,035
So we have some cool concept art here.

132
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,379
And the Crown City is a cultural amalgam.

133
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,401
Our art team consciously intended

134
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:59,585
to show it as street scenes from the world over.

135
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,129
So you can see bits of London, New York, Paris, and Tokyo,

136
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:05,371
kind of depending on the angle you look at it from,

137
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:08,054
to make it feel both familiar and foreign

138
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:09,276
to a worldwide audience.

139
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,702
And to give it that same kind of diversity linguistically,

140
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:17,203
we employed accents according to social circle

141
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,244
more than geographic origin, which

142
00:07:19,244 --> 00:07:21,866
gave it a more modern feel than the classic all dwarves

143
00:07:21,866 --> 00:07:24,607
are Scottish fantasy trope.

144
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:26,548
So ultimately, I can't say definitively

145
00:07:26,548 --> 00:07:28,129
whether this enhanced or diminished

146
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:29,790
the reality for the audience at large,

147
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,531
but it did give us the freedom to assemble a really

148
00:07:32,531 --> 00:07:34,352
great transatlantic cast.

149
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:36,693
So that was one plus of this decision as well.

150
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:41,655
And so the next aspect might strike you as a little too real.

151
00:07:41,655 --> 00:07:47,504
The astute viewer may have noticed a fair amount of product placement in these shots.

152
00:07:48,637 --> 00:07:51,819
So yeah, some of you will find this jarring.

153
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:54,761
The lines between reality and fantasy

154
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:56,042
become very blurry here.

155
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,804
And the specter of commercialism looms kind

156
00:07:58,804 --> 00:08:01,826
of large over artistic merit.

157
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:03,727
So these imports from beyond the fourth wall

158
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:05,829
may be hard to explain away in canon,

159
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:08,110
but they do make the world more kind of recognizable

160
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,073
and familiar and more real to a good segment of the audience.

161
00:08:12,073 --> 00:08:13,895
And so that's what I tell myself at night.

162
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:18,407
When it came to hawking cup noodles in the game,

163
00:08:18,407 --> 00:08:19,927
we did it kind of tongue in cheek

164
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:21,528
because we definitely wanted to respect

165
00:08:21,528 --> 00:08:23,469
our audience's intelligence.

166
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,471
And we thought it was a playful tap on the fourth wall.

167
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:27,811
So hopefully they enjoyed that.

168
00:08:27,811 --> 00:08:31,313
And moving on to characters.

169
00:08:31,313 --> 00:08:34,514
So relatable characters can make or break your reality.

170
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,476
And so, yeah, I joked about it earlier,

171
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:41,578
but identifying with spectacularly quaffed JRPG heroes

172
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:43,839
can be a real barrier to entry for a lot of players.

173
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:46,872
And the fancy schmancy names don't always help.

174
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:50,162
So we rely on touchstones to kind of turn foreign tropes

175
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,348
into more relatable people for our audience.

176
00:08:53,892 --> 00:08:56,033
And here's the core four for our main story.

177
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:58,855
On the far left is Ignis.

178
00:08:58,855 --> 00:09:01,336
He's the suave brains of the operation,

179
00:09:01,336 --> 00:09:03,918
sort of James Bond in The Great Outdoors.

180
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,400
Next to him is Prompto, the funny fast talker,

181
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,081
kind of a zanier Ferris Bueller.

182
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:11,322
On the far right is Gladio,

183
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:13,563
who's a younger John McClane from Die Hard.

184
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:16,505
And I'll get to the rock star in the middle in a second,

185
00:09:16,505 --> 00:09:18,646
but who wouldn't want to take a road trip

186
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:21,108
with James Bond, Ferris Bueller, and John McClane?

187
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:26,912
So writing with established reference character voices in mind isn't exactly a cutting edge

188
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:30,878
technique necessarily, but it's especially critical in a localization.

189
00:09:30,878 --> 00:09:35,065
Obviously you tinker with the archetype, but it provides a compass that keeps your character

190
00:09:35,065 --> 00:09:38,069
directed for your audience through all the cultural clutter.

191
00:09:39,117 --> 00:09:42,980
And another key point here is that the analogs aren't sidekicks.

192
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,742
Each one has his own brand of cool.

193
00:09:44,742 --> 00:09:46,604
Each can carry his own story.

194
00:09:46,604 --> 00:09:48,965
Each is the normal one in his own mind.

195
00:09:48,965 --> 00:09:51,888
And so it really keeps the give and take fresh,

196
00:09:51,888 --> 00:09:55,071
because they all feel they're right.

197
00:09:55,071 --> 00:09:58,654
And so here's a little side story about Noctis's character.

198
00:09:58,654 --> 00:10:01,436
I always use scripted characters for my references,

199
00:10:01,436 --> 00:10:03,638
and I avoid using real people, because real people.

200
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,094
You don't know them as well as you think you do necessarily.

201
00:10:07,094 --> 00:10:10,237
And so I just always prefer to use characters.

202
00:10:10,237 --> 00:10:11,418
So I knew who he wasn't.

203
00:10:11,418 --> 00:10:15,882
He wasn't going to be the whiny emoji RPG character.

204
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:16,883
But whose voice was it?

205
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:22,229
And I was actually talking to the Japanese voice actor for Noctis, who one night told

206
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:24,971
me that his inspiration was sort of Kurt Cobain.

207
00:10:25,312 --> 00:10:27,812
who's kind of sweet at heart, but always on edge,

208
00:10:27,812 --> 00:10:29,912
and this rock star who scorns the spotlight.

209
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:31,353
And it really clicked for me.

210
00:10:31,353 --> 00:10:32,853
It was kind of an epiphany.

211
00:10:32,853 --> 00:10:35,193
And so this is my one exception

212
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:37,614
to my only using scripted character roles.

213
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:39,454
And so if you have the opportunity

214
00:10:39,454 --> 00:10:41,955
to talk to your Japanese voice cast,

215
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:44,335
it's a great place for ideas.

216
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:46,316
Failing that, your English voice cast

217
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:48,596
can give you a lot of input into the characters.

218
00:10:48,596 --> 00:10:50,976
And so, yeah, if you do have voice actors,

219
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:52,277
definitely use them.

220
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,617
They know their characters kind of as well as we writers do.

221
00:10:57,252 --> 00:11:05,036
Next up, so one bonus of having these independent backstories and flashbacks is that it added persistence to the universe and to the characters.

222
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:12,139
And so each story had its self-contained arc, but when you put them together, they form these life arcs for the characters.

223
00:11:12,962 --> 00:11:16,345
And this really added psychological depth to the characters.

224
00:11:16,345 --> 00:11:18,887
So if you go into the game alone,

225
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:21,609
Noctis starts off as kind of a disenchanted youth

226
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:25,293
who embarks on a journey to overcome sort of self-doubt.

227
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:27,635
But when we see him as a kid,

228
00:11:27,635 --> 00:11:29,596
he's actually a really happy kid.

229
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:32,358
And we see the events that kind of cause him

230
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,740
to become the disenchanted youth we meet later.

231
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,122
But together, when you take his childhood story

232
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:39,104
and the story we see in game,

233
00:11:39,104 --> 00:11:40,886
it forms this story of...

234
00:11:41,346 --> 00:11:44,627
recovering lost innocence, which is kind of beautiful.

235
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:48,189
And similarly, with Prompto, there's

236
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:50,770
some stories of his insecurity and brotherhood,

237
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,771
and that gets reprised in sort of a heart-to-heart conversation

238
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:55,372
he has later.

239
00:11:55,372 --> 00:11:58,694
And so this is kind of that independent yet integrated

240
00:11:58,694 --> 00:11:59,074
at best.

241
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:01,295
Both stories stand on their own, but it

242
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:04,176
gives you kind of a deeper appreciation when they connect.

243
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,300
And the last point is a little more technical.

244
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,261
So Final Fantasy XV is a road trip

245
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:13,462
where you spend a lot of time hanging out with your friends

246
00:12:13,462 --> 00:12:16,443
and that feeling really needed to be immersive.

247
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:18,644
So we devoted a lot of our energy

248
00:12:18,644 --> 00:12:21,404
to creating this conversational chemistry.

249
00:12:21,404 --> 00:12:23,065
Making the friendship feel real

250
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:25,506
was kind of the heart of the player experience

251
00:12:25,506 --> 00:12:27,967
and these are some of the formula we applied.

252
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:37,896
This is very early, but early on we defined the interpersonal dynamics and kind of personalized them by equipping each with his fair share of

253
00:12:37,896 --> 00:12:39,757
nicknames for the others.

254
00:12:39,757 --> 00:12:46,821
We also kept little background speech ticks and idiosyncrasies for them, like generally avoids contractions,

255
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:48,722
never says he's sorry, and that sort of thing.

256
00:12:48,722 --> 00:12:52,484
Establishing these kind of behind-the-scenes rules

257
00:12:52,484 --> 00:12:57,287
was really invaluable given that we had multiple writers working on the project and it was across media.

258
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:00,326
So it was good to have these background rules that we could refer to.

259
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:06,125
We also used linguistic techniques to flesh them out.

260
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:08,506
To bring home the kind of casual and comfortable feel

261
00:13:08,506 --> 00:13:12,307
of the characters, we tended to drop subjects

262
00:13:12,307 --> 00:13:15,087
whenever possible, and we also leaned on our voice actors

263
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:18,268
for organic non-verbals, those little mumbles and clicks

264
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:21,048
and squeaks that can be tricky to script.

265
00:13:21,048 --> 00:13:23,529
So along with breathing life into the characters,

266
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:25,689
these tricks helped us hit our line timings

267
00:13:25,689 --> 00:13:27,509
because every line in the game had to match

268
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:28,650
the Japanese timing.

269
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:34,478
precisely. So that was really invaluable for keeping it sounding natural. And then the

270
00:13:34,478 --> 00:13:38,760
last thing I have here is another technique we use to mimic real world speech that I call

271
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,224
Sorkinization, where each line picks up on or directly ties into the words of the line

272
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:49,367
before where you borrow a word to start a line or spit it back with a little twist or

273
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:52,650
expound on a metaphor or kind of mimic the delivery.

274
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:56,107
So picking up recently heard words is something natural

275
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:58,428
to language that we all do kind of unconsciously

276
00:13:58,428 --> 00:14:01,769
and done in moderation, it can add a natural feel

277
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:02,510
to the dialogue.

278
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,030
Of course, if you overdo it,

279
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,752
you get a little too much Sorkin in it,

280
00:14:06,752 --> 00:14:08,833
but yeah, use in moderation would be my advice.

281
00:14:10,535 --> 00:14:14,597
And lastly for our plans, I wanted to talk about our plans for lore.

282
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:20,801
So Final Fantasy developed an unfortunate reputation for kind of delving into the esoteric

283
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:26,204
with its cosmology and for inundating players with unpronounceable proper nouns.

284
00:14:26,204 --> 00:14:32,288
So we wanted to keep the lore rich, we wanted rich lore but needed to make it accessible.

285
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,869
So we built an on-ramp here.

286
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:41,249
And so we focused on the layman's kind of understanding of lore and made sure that we

287
00:14:41,249 --> 00:14:43,990
could couch it in easy to digest terminology.

288
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:50,493
So we used terms like gods, demons, messengers, oracles, things that the average person on

289
00:14:50,493 --> 00:14:52,093
the street had heard of.

290
00:14:52,093 --> 00:14:56,895
Our summoned characters, which every Final Fantasy names differently, were called astrals.

291
00:14:58,918 --> 00:15:03,941
We basically made sure that everybody could be clear on the basic ground rules for lore.

292
00:15:03,941 --> 00:15:09,524
And then to prevent it from becoming too flat, we added in some flair in the forms of cryptonyms

293
00:15:09,524 --> 00:15:10,824
and kennings.

294
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:15,427
So pictured here is the astral titan, who's also known as the god of earth, and that's

295
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:18,248
how most of the people of the world refer to him.

296
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:23,250
But every now and then you'll hear him called the Archean or land forger for a more kind

297
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,892
of eloquent style, depending on the context and who's talking.

298
00:15:28,956 --> 00:15:31,899
So that was one way we kind of dolled up our lore.

299
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,803
And one other mode I personally enjoyed working on

300
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:36,784
was our Surreality.

301
00:15:36,784 --> 00:15:39,567
And this is one example of some things we did

302
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,188
to kind of bring home a surreal feel.

303
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:47,015
So here we see Gentiana, a messenger who is in fact,

304
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:50,076
spoilers, the avatar of the ice goddess Shiva.

305
00:15:50,076 --> 00:15:52,678
I'm sorry if that spoiled it for you.

306
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:52,958
Sorry.

307
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,679
To keep her shrouded in mystery,

308
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,021
we wrote her dialogue to not use you or I,

309
00:15:58,021 --> 00:16:00,102
and it really created that sort of

310
00:16:00,102 --> 00:16:03,084
otherworldly, detached feeling.

311
00:16:03,084 --> 00:16:05,625
We kind of stole a page from Song of Ice and Fire,

312
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,266
Game of Thrones' Jaqen H'ghar.

313
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,287
That's kind of how he talks.

314
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:11,824
But we did it in a little different way, and it worked really well for her.

315
00:16:11,824 --> 00:16:15,867
So we kind of stretched it out to all our gods, that they wouldn't use those direct

316
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:20,572
subjects and would give them kind of a detachment from humanity, which worked really well in

317
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:26,837
monologues, but it made writing dialogue really, really difficult because obviously the person

318
00:16:26,837 --> 00:16:29,700
they're interacting with has to understand it as well.

319
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,543
And it took a lot of polishing to get right, but it was fun to do.

320
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,534
So yeah, beyond the structure, the diction we used was also chosen to convey that eerie

321
00:16:39,534 --> 00:16:42,977
feeling that something beyond our understanding is happening.

322
00:16:42,977 --> 00:16:48,602
So using interpretive language in our god scenes and our dream sequences gave more weight

323
00:16:48,602 --> 00:16:49,123
to the words.

324
00:16:49,123 --> 00:16:54,067
So for instance, the Japanese might literally state that the astral gods have granted you

325
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:54,688
their power.

326
00:16:55,332 --> 00:16:59,215
which we rendered as the stars shine for you now,

327
00:16:59,215 --> 00:17:02,458
which accomplishes the goal of the point

328
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,461
and allows for deeper interpretations and also

329
00:17:05,461 --> 00:17:09,385
kind of adds depth to our cosmology as well. So we really enjoyed

330
00:17:09,385 --> 00:17:11,767
using that sort of interpretive dialogue as a tool.

331
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:16,277
So those are some pages on our playbook

332
00:17:16,277 --> 00:17:18,798
for establishing reality and surreality,

333
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:21,079
and I realize that nothing I've described so far

334
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,040
is particularly revolutionary or game-changing.

335
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,120
Many of you have probably employed similar techniques

336
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,881
in your own work.

337
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:29,602
What inspired me to give this talk, however,

338
00:17:29,602 --> 00:17:31,522
was observing how some of these traditional

339
00:17:31,522 --> 00:17:33,763
tried-and-true tactics proceeded to backfire

340
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:36,064
as the project progressed.

341
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:37,604
So this act is in two parts,

342
00:17:37,604 --> 00:17:39,625
covering the wacky adventures of production

343
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,565
and the zany mishaps of promotion.

344
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,652
So, remember that bit I did on character chemistry

345
00:17:46,652 --> 00:17:47,733
and Sorkinization?

346
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,895
That worked out fine for our cut scenes and set pieces,

347
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:53,877
but as it turned out, some of our pieces weren't so set.

348
00:17:56,523 --> 00:17:58,024
And after we completed our recording

349
00:17:58,024 --> 00:18:00,324
for the episode Dusk Eye demo,

350
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:02,885
we observed something interesting.

351
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:06,407
Part of our AI team's plan to maximize our voice assets

352
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:07,647
had been to concatenate the lines.

353
00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:13,330
On the left here is the conversation metrics that they used

354
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,610
and on the right was a snippet

355
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,831
of the original linear studio script that we had submitted.

356
00:18:18,492 --> 00:18:22,599
And this wasn't a branching dialogue tree, but also not entirely random.

357
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:27,687
The patterns were defined, but the same voice line could appear in very different mini-conversations,

358
00:18:27,687 --> 00:18:31,133
with different lines preceding or following, and sometimes no lines.

359
00:18:32,022 --> 00:18:36,884
So after all the effort we'd put into making our characters sound as humanly possible,

360
00:18:36,884 --> 00:18:43,066
as human as humanly possible, the conversation started to kind of sound like robocalls.

361
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:47,748
So making an interchangeable dialogue system work in text is hard enough.

362
00:18:47,748 --> 00:18:51,530
Set aside our lofty intentions of having the characters pick up on each other's lines.

363
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,392
And simply making the subjects and predicates agree

364
00:18:55,392 --> 00:18:58,553
grammatically was going to be difficult.

365
00:18:58,553 --> 00:19:00,594
So to pass the Turing test, we established,

366
00:19:00,594 --> 00:19:01,295
we worked with our AI team,

367
00:19:01,295 --> 00:19:03,376
and we established a couple ground rules.

368
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:04,897
The first was to separate the lines

369
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:07,778
that would launch a conversation for tonal difference.

370
00:19:08,459 --> 00:19:11,901
Secondly, we worked on mapping out the specs linguistically,

371
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,703
because Japanese doesn't use plurals

372
00:19:13,703 --> 00:19:15,784
and treat subjects differently.

373
00:19:15,784 --> 00:19:17,946
And lastly, we needed to be able to stretch

374
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:20,027
any permutations that weren't working,

375
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:23,250
because you always need a safety clause.

376
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,272
And our AI team was great about helping us with it.

377
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:31,909
And it turned out really well. It was pretty organic. It was better than I expected. Our

378
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:35,471
banter was actually really well received and some of it was scripted and some of it was

379
00:19:35,471 --> 00:19:39,593
this sort of organic concatenation. It really sounded like when you're on the road with

380
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:44,355
your friends for too long and you just kind of, your mind's in the distance. So it came

381
00:19:44,355 --> 00:19:45,856
across really authentic in that way.

382
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:53,769
So, as stated earlier, the Final Fantasy XV universe didn't feature spin-offs with only

383
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:54,330
a few touch points.

384
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,631
Everything was interwoven.

385
00:19:56,631 --> 00:20:02,174
So with three separate production teams for game, film, and anime, you run into some continuity

386
00:20:02,174 --> 00:20:02,995
issues.

387
00:20:02,995 --> 00:20:09,199
So I'm not going to rip any of our minor stitches into plot holes right here, but we did make

388
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:14,162
sure to cover all our logistics and details in the background at least, hopefully.

389
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:19,125
So while we managed to reconcile those details, there were kind of larger continuity concerns

390
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,446
that grew as the universe was expanding.

391
00:20:21,446 --> 00:20:25,227
Namely, how does this all fit together?

392
00:20:25,227 --> 00:20:31,169
So here you see dudes around a campfire, a tense confrontation with royalty, an illustrated

393
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:33,550
boy petting a dog, and a transforming flying car.

394
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:36,050
How do these people talk to each other?

395
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:40,852
It simply wasn't practical to have one overarching style that would apply to everything.

396
00:20:41,312 --> 00:20:47,274
So if we couldn't have that, at least we needed to have contiguity, which is to say maintaining

397
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:52,795
suspension of belief at the seams where Technobabble met the arcane or where high fantasy met casual

398
00:20:52,795 --> 00:20:53,196
banter.

399
00:20:53,196 --> 00:20:57,897
And we actually encounter one of these in the very first scene of our game as Regis,

400
00:20:57,897 --> 00:21:01,238
a character with a high fantasy tone, is established in the film.

401
00:21:01,598 --> 00:21:05,039
is sending off Noctis, aka Kurt Cobain.

402
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,421
We found this, so we, I'm sorry,

403
00:21:08,421 --> 00:21:10,962
we found the key to connecting their speech

404
00:21:10,962 --> 00:21:14,283
was to build off the emotional father and son dynamic

405
00:21:14,283 --> 00:21:16,244
and let the emotional content

406
00:21:16,244 --> 00:21:18,725
kind of supersede the stylistic.

407
00:21:18,725 --> 00:21:20,686
We found this with other characters as well.

408
00:21:20,686 --> 00:21:22,667
When you draw on the relationship,

409
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:26,868
it kind of overwrote whatever stylistic conventions you were

410
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:29,509
trying to build beyond that.

411
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:32,431
So it kept the characters in the same scene

412
00:21:32,431 --> 00:21:34,192
and indirectly in the same world.

413
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:37,373
And the last production test of time I have

414
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:40,715
is pretty straightforward.

415
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:43,496
For Authenticity, we cast kids for our child roles

416
00:21:43,496 --> 00:21:46,057
and they turned in amazing performances.

417
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:48,638
But as our production schedule lagged on,

418
00:21:48,638 --> 00:21:50,499
we did get a little nervous.

419
00:21:50,499 --> 00:21:53,160
Just remember that your in-game kids will be young forever,

420
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,681
but your voice actors will grow up

421
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:56,982
and plan accordingly when you schedule.

422
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:06,193
So this was the intricate space-time tapestry of our rollout, and you'll notice I've included

423
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:07,594
trailers in here.

424
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:10,216
Most of us would not consider PR as part of our story.

425
00:22:10,216 --> 00:22:14,260
Traditionally, the story is the part that is permanent, the thing that will be left

426
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,682
decades after the dust is cleared.

427
00:22:16,682 --> 00:22:18,443
Promotion is an ephemeral phenomenon.

428
00:22:18,443 --> 00:22:20,024
It happens, and then it dies.

429
00:22:20,705 --> 00:22:23,326
But now more than ever, games are also phenomena.

430
00:22:23,326 --> 00:22:26,807
They are experiences to which context is integral.

431
00:22:26,807 --> 00:22:29,648
And they may have metas, they'll probably be patched,

432
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,669
and they'll definitely be memed.

433
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:34,330
So nowadays, games happen, and that's true

434
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:35,491
even for single-player games.

435
00:22:37,753 --> 00:22:39,174
So we'll start at the beginning.

436
00:22:39,174 --> 00:22:41,516
In the writing of any book, film, or game,

437
00:22:41,516 --> 00:22:43,698
there looms a specter of those critical early questions

438
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:44,479
we have to ask ourselves.

439
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:48,742
So what, who cares, and why does any of this matter?

440
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,144
And more and more, audiences attempt to

441
00:22:51,144 --> 00:22:54,447
kind of answer these questions by overanalyzing trailers.

442
00:22:54,447 --> 00:22:58,610
So prior to the release of the previous slide,

443
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,232
before our regional marketing was really up and running,

444
00:23:01,232 --> 00:23:04,295
the majority of news and promotion for the game

445
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:06,857
was coming out of Japan in the name of global promotion.

446
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:09,322
where English content was being plugged

447
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:11,404
into Japanese trailers.

448
00:23:11,404 --> 00:23:13,305
So as I mentioned earlier,

449
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:16,006
we tend to rethink things from the ground up

450
00:23:16,006 --> 00:23:17,587
in our localizations,

451
00:23:17,587 --> 00:23:19,388
but we'd always done this on the assumption

452
00:23:19,388 --> 00:23:22,270
that the information would be conveyed in the classic style,

453
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:24,151
i.e. when the player starts playing the game.

454
00:23:24,151 --> 00:23:27,233
So while our character naming and accenting decisions

455
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:30,956
were being made with a larger background exposition in mind,

456
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:32,076
the audience wasn't seeing this,

457
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:34,758
and the global promotion and English exposition

458
00:23:34,758 --> 00:23:35,478
were out of sync.

459
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,423
So we needed to prevent the misunderstandings

460
00:23:38,423 --> 00:23:39,423
from melting down the internet.

461
00:23:39,423 --> 00:23:43,247
Communicating with our regional marketing teams,

462
00:23:43,247 --> 00:23:44,328
once we got them up and running,

463
00:23:44,328 --> 00:23:46,850
and knowing their promotional schedules and messaging,

464
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,554
let us better kind of contextualize our content

465
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:53,777
for our audience, and tell a more cohesive story.

466
00:23:53,777 --> 00:23:55,559
And they also helped cover for us,

467
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:58,041
like in the demo where we had the term Archean,

468
00:23:58,041 --> 00:23:59,843
but we didn't have the term Astrals yet.

469
00:24:00,223 --> 00:24:04,385
and people thought that the Archeans were the Summons when they're really the Astrals.

470
00:24:04,385 --> 00:24:07,126
I know it's a minor detail, but it's a huge deal.

471
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:10,207
And our marketing was really good about contacting the community

472
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:14,068
and getting the fans to get on board with the correct terminology.

473
00:24:14,068 --> 00:24:16,009
So, we owe them one for that.

474
00:24:16,969 --> 00:24:19,210
So we worked on a lot of things for them also.

475
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:22,011
We were looking at their figurine box descriptions

476
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:24,312
and Latin American launch events

477
00:24:24,312 --> 00:24:26,172
and commercial newspapers that would probably

478
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:28,513
get screen capped and soundtrack titles.

479
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:30,433
And we really ended up looking at a lot of stuff,

480
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:32,674
but that's kind of all part of maintaining the universe.

481
00:24:35,013 --> 00:24:38,718
So one danger, however, of being steeped in your game's promotion so much is that you

482
00:24:38,718 --> 00:24:43,464
lose sight of the players who come in blind, those who haven't been following the news

483
00:24:43,464 --> 00:24:45,928
or watching the companion projects.

484
00:24:45,928 --> 00:24:50,474
So how do you bring that audience up to speed without alienating or boring your avid fans?

485
00:24:53,198 --> 00:24:54,920
So there's no easy answer for this.

486
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,621
I'm not sure we found the solution.

487
00:24:56,621 --> 00:25:00,385
There's just so many permutations of the story,

488
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:03,649
storytelling and having an open world format

489
00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:05,110
it only adds to the chaos.

490
00:25:06,182 --> 00:25:10,506
So, first and foremost, the game's tale needs to stand on its own legs, and you write for

491
00:25:10,506 --> 00:25:11,867
the uninitiated audience.

492
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:16,071
But that said, you don't want to kind of spoon-feed people what they already know.

493
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:22,177
And so one of the keys for us was to be nonchalant about our surprises and things, so that the

494
00:25:22,177 --> 00:25:26,421
people who already saw it coming wouldn't feel too kind of taken there.

495
00:25:27,188 --> 00:25:31,051
It also helps to be conscious of things like making sure you name drop in dialogue more

496
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:36,293
than you would normally, and making sure any key plot points from other media would at

497
00:25:36,293 --> 00:25:40,536
least be available in ancillary text or interactive objects.

498
00:25:40,536 --> 00:25:44,998
So yeah, in Final Fantasy XV we actually ended up with some kind of heavy-handed measures

499
00:25:44,998 --> 00:25:51,001
like announcing characters' names on screen and a montage from the film.

500
00:25:51,001 --> 00:25:52,262
But your mileage may vary.

501
00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:55,964
We also had to be mindful of...

502
00:25:56,375 --> 00:26:00,620
not overselling our reveals, uh, because you don't want to rub in the dissonance that the

503
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:05,727
player knows something that the character doesn't. Which brings me to my next point.

504
00:26:07,334 --> 00:26:10,396
So one of the earlier trailers for the game back in 2014

505
00:26:10,396 --> 00:26:14,138
showed the invasion of insomnia pretty much giving away

506
00:26:14,138 --> 00:26:17,260
the ending of the film, like I just did right now.

507
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,102
But somehow it didn't spoil the story.

508
00:26:20,102 --> 00:26:24,125
A trailer at Tokyo Game Show two months before our release

509
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,886
unveiled the main villain, which the player character realizes

510
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:27,907
only halfway through the game.

511
00:26:27,907 --> 00:26:31,309
But this also didn't ruin things like I feared it might.

512
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:34,031
And so I think this owes to the story's reliance

513
00:26:34,031 --> 00:26:35,872
on suspense over surprise.

514
00:26:37,953 --> 00:26:42,338
I imagine a lot of you are familiar with the Hitchcock parable about the bomb in a restaurant.

515
00:26:42,338 --> 00:26:46,703
You know, if the bomb goes off without warning, you surprise the audience for 10 seconds,

516
00:26:46,703 --> 00:26:51,629
whereas if you let the audience know there's a bomb under the table, it'll go off at 3,

517
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:55,893
and you put a clock on the back that says 2.45, you get 15 minutes of suspense.

518
00:26:56,534 --> 00:27:01,758
So spoilers really only spoil stories when they, when the stories intentionally hide

519
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:04,461
things or mislead the audience to hit them with a twist.

520
00:27:04,461 --> 00:27:08,684
I mean you know that Caesar is going to die in the end, but you stay tuned to Julius Caesar

521
00:27:08,684 --> 00:27:10,025
to find out how.

522
00:27:10,025 --> 00:27:14,869
So in the age of internet crowdsource theories where kind of every outcome can be anticipated

523
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:19,633
by someone, leaning on big twists is becoming less and less kind of tenable.

524
00:27:20,314 --> 00:27:23,256
Unless you can completely fence your game experience off.

525
00:27:23,256 --> 00:27:25,978
So naturally you need some surprises in your work.

526
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,759
You don't want it to be too boring.

527
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:30,001
But if you're relying on the big twist in 2017,

528
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:30,422
it's not a good idea.

529
00:27:30,422 --> 00:27:31,522
Okay, so the meaning of life.

530
00:27:31,522 --> 00:27:32,283
Hold on, I skipped ahead one.

531
00:27:43,498 --> 00:27:48,123
So life is short, which is to say fleeting or finite.

532
00:27:48,123 --> 00:27:52,428
So Final Fantasy XV wasn't really built for eternity.

533
00:27:52,428 --> 00:27:54,731
It's not gonna be brought out of cobwebs

534
00:27:54,731 --> 00:27:57,313
and 100 years from now be ported to PlayStation 42.

535
00:27:57,313 --> 00:27:59,596
The language and reality present

536
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:01,098
is very much a product of our time

537
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:04,541
and the experience is constantly kind of evolving

538
00:28:04,541 --> 00:28:04,962
to survive.

539
00:28:06,135 --> 00:28:08,720
My second point is that life is messy.

540
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,164
I'm sorry, I didn't set this up good enough.

541
00:28:11,164 --> 00:28:13,990
So by meaning of life, what I mean by this is...

542
00:28:14,977 --> 00:28:19,957
When I said bringing fantasy to life as the topic for the talk, life is a very vague thing

543
00:28:19,957 --> 00:28:24,858
and I realize a lot of people cop to it, so I wanted to talk about what life meant to

544
00:28:24,858 --> 00:28:26,619
me in the scope of Final Fantasy XV.

545
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:32,520
So first being life is short, where obviously it's a product of its time, and then life

546
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,760
is messy being all the unpredictable things that happen on Final Fantasy XV.

547
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,181
It doesn't really have emergent narrative, but it's also far from authorial because there's

548
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:44,222
so many hands in it, both development side and promotional side.

549
00:28:44,862 --> 00:28:47,222
And so I'm not sure what it's gonna look like

550
00:28:47,222 --> 00:28:49,502
a year from now, which is both frightening

551
00:28:49,502 --> 00:28:51,963
and exhilarating, a lot like life.

552
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:56,904
And then my last point is that life is fun.

553
00:28:56,904 --> 00:28:59,484
So, so many cool things have happened

554
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:00,224
that we didn't expect.

555
00:29:00,224 --> 00:29:03,045
Our voice actors play the game on Twitch.

556
00:29:03,045 --> 00:29:06,166
These forum debates and these hilarious memes

557
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:07,846
and our team is always taking it

558
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,806
and finding ways to tuck it into the game.

559
00:29:09,806 --> 00:29:11,226
There was someone...

560
00:29:11,987 --> 00:29:14,608
on our marketing team kind of dialed a tweet once

561
00:29:14,608 --> 00:29:17,590
and it was this random string of letters

562
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,651
that got like a million likes, it was ridiculous.

563
00:29:20,651 --> 00:29:22,512
So we just took that and made it one of like,

564
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:24,133
in the mobile game, it's one of the random names

565
00:29:24,133 --> 00:29:25,634
it generates.

566
00:29:25,634 --> 00:29:28,235
So just being able to kind of tie those things together,

567
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:29,636
it's been a lot of fun.

568
00:29:29,636 --> 00:29:31,777
So all the missteps and successes along the way

569
00:29:31,777 --> 00:29:33,638
have made for an amazing ride.

570
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,379
And so making the game was a lot of fun,

571
00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:37,260
I hope playing the game was a lot of fun.

572
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,502
And talking here has been a lot of fun.

573
00:29:40,502 --> 00:29:41,322
So thank you.
