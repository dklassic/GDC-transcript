00:00:06,987 --> 00:00:07,667
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:08,388 --> 00:00:08,648
Hi.

3
00:00:08,668 --> 00:00:11,449
Hey.

4
00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:15,470
Well, welcome to my talk called

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,731
Moving the Needle in User Research

6
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:19,271
Toward the End of Production.

7
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:22,632
We're going to be covering today a case study

8
00:00:23,032 --> 00:00:25,393
in PVZ Garden Warfare.

9
00:00:27,134 --> 00:00:31,275
And just to get to know each other a little bit,

10
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:32,035
I'll do my part.

11
00:00:32,965 --> 00:00:34,286
My name is Veronica Zamito.

12
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:37,768
I'm a lead researcher at Electronic Arts,

13
00:00:38,848 --> 00:00:41,050
which is one of the amazing aspects of working at EA.

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,331
It's a great portfolio.

15
00:00:43,451 --> 00:00:46,113
So I've been working on different franchises,

16
00:00:46,173 --> 00:00:50,315
including Battlefield, NHL, FIFA, Madden,

17
00:00:50,936 --> 00:00:51,896
among other titles.

18
00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:53,297
So I keep it very exciting.

19
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:56,939
My background is in psychology and HCI.

20
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:01,902
Game studies is exactly where I fit.

21
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:06,598
So, now that you know where I'm coming from,

22
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,562
let's jump in right away to what this is.

23
00:01:11,582 --> 00:01:16,626
I bet that all of you are very familiar with this mantra,

24
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:20,189
test early, test often, which is fantastic, it's good,

25
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:21,190
you should really do it.

26
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:29,076
However, every project gets to the last stretch

27
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:29,856
of production.

28
00:01:30,797 --> 00:01:32,338
You have that game, it's...

29
00:01:33,423 --> 00:01:34,524
There you are committed.

30
00:01:34,944 --> 00:01:38,287
It's looking good, but there is still some gaps in there.

31
00:01:39,188 --> 00:01:42,951
And those core game mechanics are good,

32
00:01:43,412 --> 00:01:45,954
but that final shape needs to be fleshed out

33
00:01:45,974 --> 00:01:46,735
a little bit more.

34
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:49,717
And that's exactly what's going to happen.

35
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:54,141
It's about moving that needle more and more and more.

36
00:01:55,923 --> 00:02:00,446
It's about asking, how can we go from good to great?

37
00:02:04,464 --> 00:02:07,726
There are specific challenges near the end of production.

38
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:11,548
And things to really, really keep in mind

39
00:02:11,828 --> 00:02:14,350
is there is no time for radical changes.

40
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,011
They're pretty much committed.

41
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:20,894
So the use of research that is going to happen at this stage

42
00:02:21,034 --> 00:02:24,716
is going to be primarily about fine-tuning that gameplay.

43
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:32,641
For doing that, you need to deconstruct problem areas.

44
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:38,488
And with that, I mean exactly to pass it like a fine-toothed comb

45
00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:41,770
through the game mechanics, through the different game elements.

46
00:02:43,311 --> 00:02:47,494
That deconstruction is going to require some time, different methodologies,

47
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:52,858
and metrics are going to be your best friend for this.

48
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,541
And don't be afraid about changing focus.

49
00:02:58,102 --> 00:02:58,622
Right now,

50
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,262
The point number one says there is no time.

51
00:03:01,842 --> 00:03:06,826
You need to actually prioritize and find those weak spots.

52
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:11,090
So focus sometimes can pivot from one area to another one

53
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,831
based on the player's feedback.

54
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:21,899
To actually exemplify a little bit more

55
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,242
about this distinction between earlier stages,

56
00:03:25,402 --> 00:03:27,684
pre-pro towards later in production.

57
00:03:29,257 --> 00:03:30,798
The goals are going to be different.

58
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:33,200
User research is going to be done throughout,

59
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,381
but the needs are going to change.

60
00:03:36,361 --> 00:03:38,503
Early in the stages are going to be more about

61
00:03:38,563 --> 00:03:40,684
those core game mechanics,

62
00:03:41,224 --> 00:03:43,626
and user flow and usability,

63
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:45,427
that sort of thing that you really care to

64
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:48,428
wipe out of the board at that time,

65
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:51,970
where later, common things that you really want to do

66
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:55,933
are related to progression, the fine-tuning, and balancing.

67
00:03:57,523 --> 00:04:01,224
There are different techniques, so you'll be using different tools to achieve this.

68
00:04:02,165 --> 00:04:05,306
One-on-one and think-aloud are great for earlier stages,

69
00:04:05,786 --> 00:04:12,108
where later in the game development you really want to go more questionnaires and telemetry.

70
00:04:12,428 --> 00:04:16,350
And the data is going to be different, so it has to be treated slightly different.

71
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:23,212
What I want to really point out here is about the affective and behavioral data.

72
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,207
With affective, I mean everything related to feelings,

73
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:31,230
emotions, attitudes, things that are really hard to measure.

74
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:35,934
And behavioral, at this point of the development process,

75
00:04:36,054 --> 00:04:39,576
I do mean the in-game actions that players are doing.

76
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:45,660
There is a plethora, actually, of different techniques.

77
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,843
I just took those that are more relevant,

78
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:51,804
that the ones that are the bread and butter

79
00:04:51,844 --> 00:04:53,185
that you really want to use.

80
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,751
But there are more.

81
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:59,013
And you will be cherry picking at different stages,

82
00:04:59,053 --> 00:05:00,794
depending on the study that you have at hand,

83
00:05:01,154 --> 00:05:02,154
to use one of this.

84
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:05,116
I'm not going to go over all of it,

85
00:05:05,136 --> 00:05:06,997
because that would be a talk by itself.

86
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:10,218
But I really wanted to point out those in red,

87
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:12,960
which are, as I mentioned, the bread and butter

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,500
of things that you really want to use

89
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,761
towards the end of production.

90
00:05:17,462 --> 00:05:20,763
Notice that those are also more on the quantitative side.

91
00:05:22,343 --> 00:05:27,786
Because at this stage, you want to be absolutely positive

92
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:32,669
that you have a good sustain of number of people

93
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,591
that are indicating that you're making that progress.

94
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:39,673
And also, quantifying this data is going to allow you

95
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:42,135
to have those metrics to push that needle.

96
00:05:45,437 --> 00:05:48,679
The whole objective subjective is more towards,

97
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:50,000
if I ask you,

98
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:53,080
From one to five, how fun was this game?

99
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,762
And you give me a number, it was super fun, it was five.

100
00:05:57,722 --> 00:05:59,503
And that's the quantifying part,

101
00:05:59,523 --> 00:06:02,125
but it's still subjective, but you cannot challenge that.

102
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:09,069
So off we go with these techniques.

103
00:06:09,309 --> 00:06:11,390
Telemetry is not going to pop up

104
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,711
right away at the end of production.

105
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:14,452
You should have been planning for that.

106
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:17,973
The researchers and designers should have discussed earlier

107
00:06:18,514 --> 00:06:19,955
about which ones.

108
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:23,625
with telemetry that you really want to track.

109
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:29,826
So now that you have that framework of different tools

110
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:32,607
that you really want to use and how you want to apply them,

111
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:35,788
let's go to Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare.

112
00:06:37,548 --> 00:06:39,769
And I want to play two very short clips.

113
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:50,618
So Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare was bringing a known brand into the shooter genre.

114
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:59,281
PVZ Garden Warfare took the traditional beloved tower defense game and turned it into a third-person shooter.

115
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:10,225
The goal was to immerse that player into the world of plants and zombies, the fighting and the battle in suburbia.

116
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:14,964
And it was designed for fans of action shooter games,

117
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:17,345
and also was inspirational for kids.

118
00:07:17,505 --> 00:07:19,787
Even though that was not necessarily a primary audience,

119
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:24,089
accessibility was a key aspect of the design.

120
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:27,632
So I'm going now to show you,

121
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:30,794
and now from the zombie side.

122
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:37,778
This one is a clip from the game mode.

123
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:39,940
Gardens and Graveyards.

124
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,862
So here they saw me trying to capture the garden,

125
00:07:42,902 --> 00:07:44,063
transform it into the graveyard.

126
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,646
And I'm going to follow up with this specific game mode

127
00:07:47,806 --> 00:07:48,567
as an example.

128
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:51,970
So it's pretty fun, very colorful.

129
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,391
You have all the shooter mechanics,

130
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:56,973
but really stripped down to the very, very essence.

131
00:07:59,315 --> 00:07:59,916
And boom.

132
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:06,236
So PVC was developed over two years.

133
00:08:06,536 --> 00:08:10,078
It started from February 2012 to February 2014.

134
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:14,961
Key questions that we need to keep brushing by the ends

135
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:17,123
were more related to character robustness,

136
00:08:17,743 --> 00:08:20,665
maps and faction balance, and progression.

137
00:08:20,765 --> 00:08:23,047
Progression from just unlocking your abilities

138
00:08:23,747 --> 00:08:27,110
to actually level up and having that long-term engagement.

139
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:33,723
So, the part that I really want to focus on

140
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,524
and share those examples are actually

141
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:38,825
for this sixth last month of production.

142
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:43,747
And I noticed that we were testing even until February 2014,

143
00:08:43,807 --> 00:08:47,289
so even two weeks before it was launched,

144
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:49,970
we were still testing and doing that fine tuning

145
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,031
because even though it wasn't necessarily in the.

146
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:59,739
It was already produced, but it was possible to at least do even more changes and keep

147
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:02,261
pushing that for the day one patch.

148
00:09:04,463 --> 00:09:09,988
So the user research goals that I want to focus on today that were key for this were

149
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:16,494
assessing the map perception and usage, ensuring the balancing of factions, and validating

150
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,856
the characters' playability and experience.

151
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:23,490
There were many, many sessions done.

152
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,552
This one shows you the typical setup

153
00:09:27,572 --> 00:09:28,793
that was used for those.

154
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,374
From a design perspective of the study,

155
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:33,995
it was a mixed method, mixing these quantitative and

156
00:09:34,055 --> 00:09:35,176
qualitative data.

157
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,638
The key tools that I told you that now you know are

158
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:43,980
instrument like questionnaire was excellent for this part

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,100
to go.

160
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:46,857
Collect all these affective and behavioral data.

161
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:48,858
And there were many different sessions,

162
00:09:49,218 --> 00:09:50,639
and for all those sessions,

163
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:56,262
we're running between 24 and 48 people per study,

164
00:09:56,962 --> 00:10:00,684
and sessions were ranging from four hours to two full days.

165
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:06,087
Now, here's an example of one of the maps,

166
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,488
Garden and Graveyard, it's a 24-players map.

167
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:11,990
Bringing people in, making them play,

168
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,031
and collecting that data.

169
00:10:14,935 --> 00:10:17,477
So going specific to the gardens and graveyards,

170
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:20,079
I mentioned it's a mode with an expanding map.

171
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,061
If you play Battlefield, it's like a rush mode,

172
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:29,226
where you have those zombies could be the attacker

173
00:10:29,366 --> 00:10:31,667
and plants will be defending, there will be a timer.

174
00:10:32,028 --> 00:10:37,732
If the timer runs out and the zombies couldn't invade,

175
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,033
zombies, plants win.

176
00:10:40,394 --> 00:10:42,895
However, if the zombies transform the garden

177
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:43,716
into a graveyard.

178
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:46,765
Before the timer, another part of the map opens.

179
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,486
This one is the map specifically for the coastal map

180
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:53,206
that has five different sub-maps.

181
00:10:56,227 --> 00:10:57,968
I mentioned to you that you want to define

182
00:10:57,988 --> 00:11:00,768
very clear metrics about what you want to do.

183
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:05,170
And these one were the metrics that we found the most useful

184
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,630
for measuring your maps and really

185
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,891
what you want to change about them.

186
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,692
So if we're there in the map size,

187
00:11:13,702 --> 00:11:17,024
The amount of cover, can you cover from the incoming damage?

188
00:11:17,705 --> 00:11:21,908
Population, how crowded or empty does it feel?

189
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:24,730
The visual appeal as well is very important.

190
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:27,592
Responding, if people were perceiving

191
00:11:27,632 --> 00:11:31,775
that they could go back to the action quickly enough or not.

192
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:34,017
And overall navigation,

193
00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:36,999
PVZ doesn't have a mini-map, doesn't have a map.

194
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,841
It's just off you go.

195
00:11:38,921 --> 00:11:40,842
So that was also really important to tackle.

196
00:11:42,673 --> 00:11:45,715
To give you an example, there were many questions

197
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:49,899
were using this scale type of question, one to five.

198
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:54,022
In this case, with example about the map size,

199
00:11:54,462 --> 00:11:57,264
from way too small to way too big,

200
00:11:57,585 --> 00:12:01,648
and a clear definition about it was the right spot,

201
00:12:02,128 --> 00:12:05,351
that sweetness that you wanted to get with the participants.

202
00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:10,285
It was, some of the demos were coming really good.

203
00:12:10,465 --> 00:12:12,926
In the maps you see that everything is between

204
00:12:13,546 --> 00:12:16,027
70 and 80% of people were actually

205
00:12:17,547 --> 00:12:19,148
thinking that it was very, very good.

206
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:22,789
There were some minor tweaking that needed to be done.

207
00:12:23,989 --> 00:12:25,570
But it was coming along.

208
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,111
We did the same exercise for all those different metrics

209
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:32,312
so we knew exactly which one we are

210
00:12:32,472 --> 00:12:33,472
and that was exactly.

211
00:12:33,992 --> 00:12:37,694
about deciding to prioritize which one you're going to be touching,

212
00:12:37,734 --> 00:12:39,275
because there is no time.

213
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:40,996
You need to prioritize.

214
00:12:41,756 --> 00:12:42,877
Uberly important.

215
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:46,659
So from all those, we did some minor tweaking

216
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:49,680
for the amount of cover from the Zombo's Mountain,

217
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:53,883
and also the re-exponding locations in the castle map.

218
00:12:56,204 --> 00:12:58,545
But you really want to triangulate multiple data.

219
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:03,088
And here we have another angle from where to address if...

220
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:08,233
Is the map actually working properly from a player's perspective?

221
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:13,575
So they were given all the different maps that they play

222
00:13:14,355 --> 00:13:19,198
and they had to rank it from most preferred to least preferred

223
00:13:19,658 --> 00:13:21,358
and from the most fun to the least fun.

224
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:29,842
Actually, those rankings were perfectly overlapping to each other, which is good.

225
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,291
Sometimes people have different reasons other than fun

226
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:34,572
to prefer something.

227
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:37,953
And I'm assuming Marina was coming out really good.

228
00:13:38,573 --> 00:13:40,934
All of the comments were primarily positive.

229
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:44,956
And we need to make some changes.

230
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:47,397
We cannot cover all, or sometimes not everything

231
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:48,117
needs to be tweaked.

232
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:52,219
And clearly the problem was with the pirate ships.

233
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,701
Actually a third of participants ranked that one

234
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,842
as the least fun and the least preferred.

235
00:14:01,378 --> 00:14:04,420
As you notice on the comments, the themes that were emerging

236
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,721
is that they were dying quite easily.

237
00:14:09,242 --> 00:14:12,544
Complementing data from, I mentioned you want to tag

238
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:15,126
for different angles and really, really understand.

239
00:14:16,226 --> 00:14:17,847
Now we know from the quantitative side

240
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:19,708
that where the problem is effective,

241
00:14:19,788 --> 00:14:21,369
now we need to know exactly why.

242
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,351
So here you have this aerial screenshot

243
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:25,712
of the pirate ship map.

244
00:14:26,412 --> 00:14:28,073
The design intention of this map

245
00:14:28,113 --> 00:14:30,915
was to recreate a pirate battle.

246
00:14:31,678 --> 00:14:33,318
It was about creating this tension

247
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:35,539
of boarding each other factions.

248
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:38,080
The zombies start from the bottom of the screen

249
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,921
and the plants have the garden on the top.

250
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:42,982
So both factions will be reaching the two ships

251
00:14:43,422 --> 00:14:46,223
and then they'll roar and board each other.

252
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:48,344
It's like, it sounded awesome at the time.

253
00:14:48,364 --> 00:14:49,004
I was like, yes.

254
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:54,066
However, it was a map that was highly disliked.

255
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:00,889
We're shown that screenshot to the players.

256
00:15:02,307 --> 00:15:03,888
There were many other screenshots,

257
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:08,550
pretty fine for having a pretty good view of the map,

258
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,491
and also for all the maps,

259
00:15:10,571 --> 00:15:13,212
but particularly for this one, which was the problematic.

260
00:15:13,912 --> 00:15:15,793
This is a heat map, but this is a heat map

261
00:15:15,913 --> 00:15:19,494
generated by the users clicking on the image,

262
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:23,076
saying which one were their least preferred locations.

263
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:28,778
As you see, it was primarily related

264
00:15:28,818 --> 00:15:30,919
to those unintended deaths.

265
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,204
The shoreline was not clear,

266
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:35,525
that you couldn't really walk into the water,

267
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:38,386
but if you look at it, it looks inviting.

268
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:40,427
Maybe there's another angle to go around,

269
00:15:40,827 --> 00:15:44,449
but really it was pretty much instant death

270
00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:46,389
if you step into the water.

271
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,130
With a heat map which has death,

272
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,291
it would have been different

273
00:15:50,311 --> 00:15:51,812
because there were many, many other deaths

274
00:15:51,852 --> 00:15:54,233
of people killing each other in other part of the maps.

275
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,294
So this one was for a really good gathering

276
00:15:57,354 --> 00:15:59,435
of visually understanding.

277
00:16:00,155 --> 00:16:02,416
what part of the map were not really working

278
00:16:03,217 --> 00:16:06,559
and getting all the qualitative question comments

279
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,041
about why it was not really working.

280
00:16:10,161 --> 00:16:12,802
So this, and in the middle as well,

281
00:16:13,063 --> 00:16:16,345
this boarding each other idea didn't work at all.

282
00:16:16,545 --> 00:16:20,187
It became more like walking off the plank kind of idea,

283
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:21,368
which is very sad.

284
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:26,010
So after each session, we'll get together

285
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,992
with the design team and analyze the data and what they did.

286
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:32,860
We're immediately jumping on and doing some changes.

287
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,081
So introducing new elements on the map to clearly indicate

288
00:16:36,141 --> 00:16:38,842
and this is not a path, this is the creation,

289
00:16:38,882 --> 00:16:40,282
you need to go to the other way.

290
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:44,224
The distance on the ships also tweak a little bit more

291
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:47,165
so it will be less likely that you will accidentally fall.

292
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,190
The crack of the engineers, love for everyone,

293
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,832
so that's why I chose that screenshot.

294
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:57,015
And all those changes actually were really good,

295
00:16:57,235 --> 00:17:00,418
and we always also look at the critics when it comes out

296
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,639
to see what we missed, what we didn't,

297
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:04,181
and what was actually picked up by them.

298
00:17:04,961 --> 00:17:08,324
So that was actually working really well.

299
00:17:09,345 --> 00:17:12,247
Now, changing to the balancing of factions.

300
00:17:13,528 --> 00:17:15,730
Having two roles of attacking and defenders

301
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,351
is not necessarily the...

302
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:23,741
easiest way of measuring fairness of these two distinctions.

303
00:17:24,902 --> 00:17:28,285
A tinned deathmatch mode would be cleaner to see

304
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:31,008
if these two factions are perfectly balanced,

305
00:17:31,148 --> 00:17:33,850
but the roles actually, they do tint a lot

306
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,531
because we knew that the roles were.

307
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:40,461
The characters had the same abilities on both modes,

308
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,342
but in this one was being more problematic

309
00:17:42,382 --> 00:17:44,103
and the perception was being different.

310
00:17:44,343 --> 00:17:46,224
So it didn't happen if the telemetry will show

311
00:17:46,284 --> 00:17:48,285
that the outputs of damage were the same,

312
00:17:48,705 --> 00:17:50,446
people were seeing differently.

313
00:17:51,206 --> 00:17:53,707
And actually that was one of the common topics

314
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:55,448
that were coming why that mode was,

315
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:57,709
what was the detrimental part of fun?

316
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:00,551
And it was that perceived unfairness,

317
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:02,592
even though it was fair for the character.

318
00:18:02,672 --> 00:18:04,313
So also retouching it slightly.

319
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:06,589
some of the health and outputs and weapon

320
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,951
for the specific mode to actually translate that.

321
00:18:10,112 --> 00:18:12,574
And actually that one picked up as well,

322
00:18:12,614 --> 00:18:14,595
so we're like, good, happy about that.

323
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:21,060
The last part of the, they wanted to share with you today

324
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,241
was about the characters.

325
00:18:22,982 --> 00:18:27,445
And there are eight core characters for perfection.

326
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:32,524
And we went over a similar exercise of deconstructing these characters.

327
00:18:32,684 --> 00:18:36,207
And for that it was more about fun, strength, health, and abilities.

328
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:40,651
There were also a lot of questions about if you were a zombie, how were you perceiving plants?

329
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:42,593
And if you were a plant, how were you perceiving zombies?

330
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:45,035
Which was very insightful as well.

331
00:18:46,096 --> 00:18:50,159
Doing a similar exercise with ranking the characters.

332
00:18:52,516 --> 00:18:55,659
We can find that the chomper, which was very unique,

333
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:00,102
is a very distinctive character for a shooter game

334
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:01,924
where you can have Boro,

335
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:03,745
and then he jumps from underneath,

336
00:19:03,865 --> 00:19:05,787
and then he has a one-hit kill.

337
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:08,729
So it was pretty novel and surprising.

338
00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:10,891
I was ranking very well about contributing

339
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:11,972
towards this fun.

340
00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:15,515
And then the foot soldier and pea shooter,

341
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:18,137
more of the archetypical shooter characters

342
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,459
were ranking very well, like excellent.

343
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:23,539
But so our problem is the sunflower.

344
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,681
And sure, the sunflower is a healer.

345
00:19:26,301 --> 00:19:29,543
If you look at the distribution of classes and preferences,

346
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,485
healers is not the majority, of course.

347
00:19:33,265 --> 00:19:36,227
But we're also looking to have different people,

348
00:19:36,307 --> 00:19:39,869
those who identify themselves as healers

349
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:42,430
and those who actually are not healers.

350
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:45,492
And from the two different demographics.

351
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,872
the sunflower was coming low.

352
00:19:49,173 --> 00:19:53,497
So, again, pivoting, let's just focus on the sunflower,

353
00:19:53,597 --> 00:19:57,040
and this one is the one that we need to focus on help.

354
00:19:58,481 --> 00:20:01,244
There were a lot of little tweaks,

355
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:05,648
primarily on the back end of the sunflower.

356
00:20:06,068 --> 00:20:09,531
And here you have all the different abilities that he has.

357
00:20:10,673 --> 00:20:11,493
And notice that

358
00:20:13,016 --> 00:20:18,359
Allowing us to get that metrics were very informal

359
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:21,541
to actually see if we're actually increasing

360
00:20:21,581 --> 00:20:23,382
and moving that needle with this character.

361
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,684
And it was, it was coming well-rounded and better.

362
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:30,206
Similar exercise with all the other characters,

363
00:20:30,286 --> 00:20:33,008
but this one was the one that needed the more urgency.

364
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:35,469
After the exercise, you would say like,

365
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,791
we nailed it, characters, boom, done.

366
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:42,333
But actually not, because we got the,

367
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,184
basic all eight core characters

368
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:51,130
But each character has actually there are six of each type

369
00:20:51,811 --> 00:20:56,377
So they are like six peashooters, six foot soldier, six sunflowers

370
00:20:56,537 --> 00:21:01,322
Blah blah blah blah blah and that's a lot and the total sum is 48

371
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:05,703
When we were ranking all the characters,

372
00:21:05,924 --> 00:21:08,265
everyone was playing all the classes.

373
00:21:08,506 --> 00:21:10,367
That's why people were able to rank them.

374
00:21:10,827 --> 00:21:13,850
But imagine that a session where you have enough time

375
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,711
to play with all 48 characters

376
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:18,353
would be pretty much close to impossible.

377
00:21:18,813 --> 00:21:23,657
So for that, adjusting the methodology to make it fit.

378
00:21:23,977 --> 00:21:25,959
So instead of having this ranking,

379
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:28,481
and even in the ranking, you really don't know

380
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:31,903
how much of a gap there is with preferred top one

381
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:32,604
to the last one.

382
00:21:33,186 --> 00:21:36,368
It's like double, it's middle, it's close to close.

383
00:21:36,408 --> 00:21:38,889
There was no difference between first rank and second rank.

384
00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:42,331
So a constant sum type of questions

385
00:21:43,212 --> 00:21:44,993
allows you to have multiple people,

386
00:21:46,033 --> 00:21:48,795
intersubjects for those of you doing the research side,

387
00:21:49,935 --> 00:21:51,676
that you can compare them better.

388
00:21:51,696 --> 00:21:57,179
And there was sections for each type of character,

389
00:21:57,639 --> 00:22:01,041
and then we could also look at all the 48 characters at once

390
00:22:01,382 --> 00:22:02,362
and actually identify.

391
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:04,837
which one from the foot soldier family,

392
00:22:05,217 --> 00:22:08,460
which one we should consider making changes,

393
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,862
and then from the whole 48 characters,

394
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:13,024
which one should we focus to make those changes.

395
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:18,048
In this example is for the foot soldier,

396
00:22:18,408 --> 00:22:21,351
actually the arctic trooper was the one

397
00:22:21,411 --> 00:22:22,292
a little more damaged.

398
00:22:22,432 --> 00:22:23,753
There was a lot of variability,

399
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:27,036
but it was still kind of clear the reasoning why.

400
00:22:27,056 --> 00:22:30,078
And as a arctic soldier,

401
00:22:30,753 --> 00:22:33,615
It throws ice and you're supposed to freeze

402
00:22:33,795 --> 00:22:35,156
and that wasn't very clear.

403
00:22:35,176 --> 00:22:37,257
The visual cues were not indicating

404
00:22:37,297 --> 00:22:39,019
that people were freezing their enemies.

405
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:41,901
The balance between freezing

406
00:22:42,141 --> 00:22:44,282
and how much output damage you can do,

407
00:22:44,883 --> 00:22:49,666
it was also not well balanced and being felt as fair.

408
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:55,890
Again, picking up, it was pretty good that at the end,

409
00:22:56,551 --> 00:22:58,192
once all the critics get it, it was.

410
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,003
This diversity that you could control, it was pretty good.

411
00:23:02,363 --> 00:23:03,464
So we were happy about that.

412
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:09,248
And now that I mentioned a lot of different specific metrics

413
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:11,851
and this construction from the different game elements,

414
00:23:12,231 --> 00:23:15,634
we also have some metrics that are going overall.

415
00:23:16,074 --> 00:23:18,256
And those more game element metrics

416
00:23:18,336 --> 00:23:20,117
are awesome for the game designer,

417
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:24,041
but also for management, producer, executive producers,

418
00:23:24,081 --> 00:23:26,262
they like to have these overarching metrics as well.

419
00:23:26,383 --> 00:23:28,184
So I had to do a combination of both.

420
00:23:29,311 --> 00:23:32,872
This one we're more looking at motivation, engagement,

421
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:34,513
and enjoyment of the game.

422
00:23:34,994 --> 00:23:37,235
And also we can see how all those changes,

423
00:23:37,355 --> 00:23:40,656
how they were affecting the overall enjoyment

424
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:44,298
and comparing from September to December sessions.

425
00:23:44,678 --> 00:23:48,260
And it was constant across the multiple game modes

426
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,362
and for how many hours people have been playing the game.

427
00:23:52,342 --> 00:23:53,643
So that was a really good indication.

428
00:23:54,123 --> 00:23:55,304
I was really moving the needle.

429
00:23:55,704 --> 00:23:56,224
Yes, no.

430
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:57,865
And here we have.

431
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:02,264
Proof of how the impact of those changes were happening.

432
00:24:03,425 --> 00:24:06,626
Now, the second moving the needle part is

433
00:24:07,846 --> 00:24:11,268
we also track in a single metric

434
00:24:11,468 --> 00:24:13,869
about how well this game is performing.

435
00:24:14,149 --> 00:24:17,050
And this one to 10 actually resembles a lot

436
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:18,450
to the Metacritic.

437
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:22,912
And regardless if Metacritic is a fair assessment

438
00:24:22,952 --> 00:24:24,653
of the game or how successful it is,

439
00:24:25,813 --> 00:24:27,794
it's a really good parameter.

440
00:24:28,688 --> 00:24:32,969
And early on, it was in a 6.8 average, so it would be a 68.

441
00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:37,890
Later on, it was getting more towards the end, it's 3.3.

442
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:41,870
And actually, the MetaCritic score ended up being 76.

443
00:24:42,711 --> 00:24:45,691
So this is kind of all those little pushes,

444
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,912
all that fine tuning that you want to get to something.

445
00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:51,412
And we were pretty excited that we were showing

446
00:24:51,452 --> 00:24:54,173
that improvement of how it would be translated to the public.

447
00:24:55,369 --> 00:25:00,092
Now you ask me, 76, are you happy with that?

448
00:25:01,073 --> 00:25:05,697
Well, no, it's 76, you really want to at least

449
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:08,579
break in the 80s, so on the one hand, no,

450
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:10,481
no really happy with that.

451
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:14,104
On the other hand, we also did that discussion about,

452
00:25:14,444 --> 00:25:17,287
well shoot, if everything was going so well,

453
00:25:17,347 --> 00:25:18,107
what was missing?

454
00:25:21,457 --> 00:25:24,218
What makes me happy, at least because of Y.76,

455
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:27,979
is that the core design intentions were there.

456
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,420
All the trees picked up on those,

457
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,342
and actually call it about PVZ, being in the shooter world,

458
00:25:35,922 --> 00:25:39,843
refreshing the genre, making it more fun, more accessible,

459
00:25:41,004 --> 00:25:43,264
classic humor, and it was there.

460
00:25:44,405 --> 00:25:47,386
But things that backfired were about

461
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:49,807
gradual content and game as a service.

462
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,943
When it was launched, not all the game modes were there,

463
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:59,406
not all the DLC and maps that were actually coming for free

464
00:25:59,787 --> 00:26:04,810
down the road were not really perceived by anyone,

465
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,332
not for the players, because that was still being discussed,

466
00:26:07,953 --> 00:26:10,274
and not from the people who on day one

467
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:12,576
saw the game and played it.

468
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:14,478
And that might have been a different strategy

469
00:26:14,498 --> 00:26:16,799
that should have been in place to surface that

470
00:26:16,959 --> 00:26:17,940
within the game.

471
00:26:18,481 --> 00:26:20,542
So actually that part of that backfired.

472
00:26:21,104 --> 00:26:24,305
We're more like other components

473
00:26:24,365 --> 00:26:26,665
that do change the perception,

474
00:26:26,725 --> 00:26:28,766
but actually those core game mechanics

475
00:26:28,806 --> 00:26:31,547
that were really fleshed out were really well.

476
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:35,808
Fair enough, I'll take the 76.

477
00:26:36,948 --> 00:26:40,009
And even though that got lower to 70,

478
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:43,509
it was still within what the game was meant to be.

479
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:45,470
So,

480
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:49,851
wrapping all this up,

481
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:55,149
Main takeaways about the last stage of production

482
00:26:55,209 --> 00:26:56,730
was that no radical changes.

483
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,731
You are committed.

484
00:26:57,751 --> 00:26:59,032
You know that you have something good,

485
00:26:59,132 --> 00:27:00,412
so make it better now.

486
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:03,734
Make your priorities, fine tune the hell out of it.

487
00:27:04,555 --> 00:27:06,196
Deconstruct everything.

488
00:27:06,936 --> 00:27:10,779
There is no time to say it was meant something or the other.

489
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,480
You really want to design that methodology.

490
00:27:13,761 --> 00:27:15,522
I share with you different examples

491
00:27:15,562 --> 00:27:18,403
of how those different type of questions can help you.

492
00:27:18,918 --> 00:27:21,999
to understand from different angles people's answers

493
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:22,779
and combine them.

494
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:27,660
The repeated measures, the whole longitudinal study as well.

495
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,081
And you really want larger samples,

496
00:27:30,121 --> 00:27:33,621
like even with 24, not even going big data,

497
00:27:33,661 --> 00:27:36,862
but with 24 you still feel more confident

498
00:27:36,882 --> 00:27:38,883
because you are repeating that through time.

499
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:42,584
You're also reinforcing and know where are you going.

500
00:27:43,764 --> 00:27:45,244
And focus on the weak spot.

501
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:52,347
Fear, pivoting from one aspect to the other,

502
00:27:52,387 --> 00:27:53,508
as I showed you in the maps,

503
00:27:53,828 --> 00:27:57,289
there were some problems on those core metrics,

504
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,410
but actually the big, big problem came from another question

505
00:28:00,671 --> 00:28:02,771
and we focused primarily on those,

506
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:06,333
combining those emotional responses

507
00:28:06,373 --> 00:28:07,533
and what people were having.

508
00:28:09,474 --> 00:28:11,875
And that is it.

509
00:28:12,135 --> 00:28:13,696
So thank you so much.

510
00:28:14,647 --> 00:28:17,736
And if you have questions, there are three mics over there.

511
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:21,186
I'm happy to answer any questions that you may have.

512
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:22,470
Thanks.
