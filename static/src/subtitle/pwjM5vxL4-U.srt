1
00:00:05,178 --> 00:00:06,959
All right, all right, all right.

2
00:00:06,979 --> 00:00:08,480
Let's get this show on the road.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,761
I think I'm pretty much contractually obligated

4
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:12,582
to start that way.

5
00:00:13,342 --> 00:00:14,743
Hi, my name is Peter Sarit,

6
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:17,584
and I'm a senior technical designer at Bungie.

7
00:00:17,704 --> 00:00:20,065
I've been in the industry for over 15 years,

8
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,326
and one of the first things I did

9
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:24,967
was I wrote the installer at Sierra Online.

10
00:00:26,228 --> 00:00:28,589
I grabbed a microphone at some point and recorded,

11
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:31,690
your system is correctly configured for playing WAV files.

12
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,632
figuring that eventually that will get replaced when we ship.

13
00:00:35,053 --> 00:00:36,394
And of course, it never did.

14
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:40,077
So my voice has shipped on millions of copies of software

15
00:00:40,517 --> 00:00:43,140
that you may have played, especially if you were playing

16
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,160
games in the mid-'90s.

17
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,303
At Microsoft, I was on the Kinect and the Kinect

18
00:00:47,323 --> 00:00:48,864
Adventures launch team.

19
00:00:49,145 --> 00:00:52,908
I designed the Mars Curiosity Lander fun lab with NASA.

20
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:57,363
And today, I'm here representing the work

21
00:00:57,824 --> 00:01:00,786
of a lot of very talented and dedicated people

22
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:04,168
who created the Gambit mode in Destiny 2 Forsaken.

23
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:07,191
So by a show of hands, who's played?

24
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:09,993
How many people out there have, wow, wow,

25
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:11,894
well, that's gratifying, thank you,

26
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:12,855
and thank you all for coming.

27
00:01:13,476 --> 00:01:15,938
So this will be a little bit of review for you,

28
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:17,639
but for the people who have not played.

29
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,159
First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to talk a little bit about what Gambit is,

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,301
and then there's the overview of what my talk is going to be,

31
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:28,902
why it's successful, what our design goals and pillars were.

32
00:01:29,542 --> 00:01:31,723
I'll talk about our prototyping process on Gambit,

33
00:01:32,283 --> 00:01:35,445
our iteration, how we focused on player communication,

34
00:01:36,225 --> 00:01:39,746
the inevitable pivot, and then some takeaways to sum up.

35
00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:42,387
So first, what is Gambit?

36
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,752
Gambit starts with fighting AI.

37
00:01:49,052 --> 00:01:54,977
Each team kills AI in two separate and identical arenas,

38
00:01:55,798 --> 00:01:56,979
one team per arena.

39
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,801
Everything that you face is going

40
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:02,003
to be designed to be the same across both.

41
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:05,045
Enemies drop motes when you kill them

42
00:02:05,145 --> 00:02:06,206
that the player can collect.

43
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:08,328
And you can only carry 15 at a time.

44
00:02:08,468 --> 00:02:10,670
If you die, any motes that you're carrying

45
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,771
are lost forever.

46
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:16,099
players deposit their motes into their team's bank,

47
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,721
which is at a central location on your team's map.

48
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:20,982
And that's how you score points and lock them in.

49
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:25,564
If you send at least five motes at once in a single deposit,

50
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:28,206
then you send a blocker to the other team

51
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:29,787
to lock down that team's bank.

52
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:31,728
Blockers don't drop motes,

53
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:34,309
and the other team has to spend time getting rid of them.

54
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,911
If you send 10 motes, if you deposit 10 motes,

55
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:39,412
you send a medium blocker,

56
00:02:39,752 --> 00:02:42,073
and at 15 motes, you send a large blocker.

57
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:46,089
When the bank hits 25, and again at 50 motes,

58
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:49,891
a portal opens up that lets one player invade the other arena

59
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:52,213
and try to kill their opponents to slow them down.

60
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,535
You have 30 seconds or one life to get the job done.

61
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:59,118
At 75 motes, a primeval spawns.

62
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:01,439
And the first team to summon and kill their primeval

63
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,100
wins the round.

64
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,702
But the other team can continually

65
00:03:04,782 --> 00:03:06,283
invade during this phase.

66
00:03:06,323 --> 00:03:08,724
And every time they do that, the primeval will heal.

67
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:10,826
So it creates a kind of tug-of-war mechanic

68
00:03:10,926 --> 00:03:11,346
at the end.

69
00:03:12,107 --> 00:03:12,547
So kill.

70
00:03:13,254 --> 00:03:15,679
Collect, bank, and invade.

71
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:18,686
Those are our four main verbs of gambit.

72
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:23,317
Why do we think that gambit was successful?

73
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:25,871
What's the magic?

74
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:28,853
We feel like we got some chocolate in your peanut butter

75
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:30,614
and some peanut butter in your chocolate.

76
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:33,496
If you're a PvE player, there's stuff for you to do.

77
00:03:33,556 --> 00:03:35,337
There are mobs of enemies that you can go after.

78
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:36,918
There's a big tanky boss at the end.

79
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:38,900
And if you're a PvP player,

80
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,461
you can take on the role of the invader.

81
00:03:40,941 --> 00:03:43,963
So it's mostly PvE with just a little bit of PvP.

82
00:03:46,277 --> 00:03:50,038
Not enough PvP to scare off PvE players was our hope.

83
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,080
And in fact, many PvE players who never played PvP

84
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,981
have a lot of fun in Gambit.

85
00:03:58,462 --> 00:04:00,663
Gambit features different roles that you can play.

86
00:04:01,144 --> 00:04:04,905
There's the Slayer of AI, the Collector of Motes,

87
00:04:06,186 --> 00:04:10,168
the Defenders of the Bank, and of course, the Invader.

88
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:13,529
So there's something for a lot of different kinds

89
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:15,650
of play styles built into the mode.

90
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:21,482
Gambit uses the full sandbox that Destiny has to offer

91
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:23,023
and lets you use all of the toys

92
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:24,905
that you've collected for your character.

93
00:04:25,146 --> 00:04:27,288
There are mobs, bosses, opposing players,

94
00:04:27,448 --> 00:04:29,910
everything you've got has a potential role

95
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:31,452
bringing it in with you in Gambit.

96
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:34,695
There's scope for strategy in your class,

97
00:04:34,755 --> 00:04:37,698
in your loadout, in your roles, and in your execution.

98
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,583
So I'll talk about our design goals and the pillars.

99
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,171
As we were creating Destiny's Forsaken expansion,

100
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:50,253
we wanted a new endgame ritual for PvE players.

101
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:53,535
So a kind of a PvE equivalent to Trials of the Nine,

102
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:56,657
which was our endgame competitive PvP mode.

103
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,319
So we had four player teams.

104
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:03,460
At this time in Destiny 2's development,

105
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,082
all of our competitive modes were standardizing on 4v4.

106
00:05:07,763 --> 00:05:09,484
So we were also going to be 4v4.

107
00:05:12,627 --> 00:05:15,108
We wanted our mode to have more variability

108
00:05:15,628 --> 00:05:16,988
than our three-player strikes,

109
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:19,129
which was the existing content

110
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:21,769
that was the most replayable stuff that we had.

111
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,470
But we wanted to have longer legs than Prison of Elders,

112
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,851
which was the piece of content in our game

113
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:30,251
that we felt would be the most direct comparison

114
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,371
to what Gambit was,

115
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:36,693
which was a sequence of fixed arenas against mobs of AI

116
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,153
that were in a pretty reliable sequence

117
00:05:39,493 --> 00:05:40,174
as you went through them.

118
00:05:40,194 --> 00:05:41,894
And it got a little bit stale over time,

119
00:05:41,934 --> 00:05:42,474
so we wanted it to be...

120
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:43,214
fresher than that.

121
00:05:44,655 --> 00:05:45,555
So here's our proposal.

122
00:05:46,255 --> 00:05:48,536
The proposal, this is like the big elevator pitch, right?

123
00:05:49,376 --> 00:05:54,258
It's Firefight, Halo Firefight meets Super Puzzle Fighter.

124
00:05:55,278 --> 00:05:56,018
What?

125
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:57,459
That was the pitch.

126
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:59,840
Two teams competing in their own arenas,

127
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,320
facing off against waves of AI,

128
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:04,301
and what you do in your arena

129
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:07,402
affects the team in the other arena.

130
00:06:10,123 --> 00:06:11,203
So we developed some pillars.

131
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,607
to base our development around.

132
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:14,887
And this is what we started with.

133
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:19,549
So custom-built arenas designed to serve Gambit gameplay.

134
00:06:20,869 --> 00:06:22,310
Comebacks are always possible.

135
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,930
We wanted to have curated randomness.

136
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,771
True randomness was a testing nightmare.

137
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:29,252
So we wanted to make it feel like it was random,

138
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:30,612
but actually have it be curated.

139
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,373
We wanted strategy to be as important as thumb skill,

140
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:37,374
pre-planning to be essential.

141
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,306
We wanted to create a new weekly ritual

142
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:42,227
that players would come back to again and again.

143
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:46,468
One team, what one team does in one place

144
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:47,889
affects the team in the other.

145
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:50,469
And no direct player interaction.

146
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:52,130
You were not gonna be able to shoot each other.

147
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,671
Only the AI.

148
00:06:55,211 --> 00:06:55,991
So that's where we began.

149
00:06:58,972 --> 00:06:59,833
We went into prototyping.

150
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:03,334
So first I have to tell you a little bit of background.

151
00:07:04,913 --> 00:07:08,575
In Destiny, each named area of the game

152
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:10,516
is what we call a bubble internally.

153
00:07:11,956 --> 00:07:14,137
This is an early diagram of the bubbles on Titan.

154
00:07:14,457 --> 00:07:16,078
It shipped a little bit differently than this,

155
00:07:16,238 --> 00:07:20,120
but there are nine bubbles here, the two big public areas that

156
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,821
are gray, and then the seven smaller private areas.

157
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:27,683
So one of our first decisions in developing Gambit

158
00:07:28,043 --> 00:07:29,304
was one bubble or two.

159
00:07:29,384 --> 00:07:30,404
We're going to have two arenas.

160
00:07:30,444 --> 00:07:31,765
Are we going to put them both in one bubble,

161
00:07:31,865 --> 00:07:34,286
or separate them into two separate bubbles?

162
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,195
The diagram of the Emerald Coast map illustrates this choice.

163
00:07:40,856 --> 00:07:43,320
So if we had two bubbles with each arena

164
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,942
in its own separate bubble,

165
00:07:45,443 --> 00:07:48,307
that would allow us to have a higher maximum AI count.

166
00:07:49,257 --> 00:07:51,319
and for that matter, a higher maximum player count.

167
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,361
If we're not splitting our resources

168
00:07:53,561 --> 00:07:56,264
amongst two different teams and two different groups of AI,

169
00:07:56,624 --> 00:07:57,745
we could support more of them.

170
00:07:58,326 --> 00:07:59,768
But we were targeting 4v4.

171
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,390
That's what all of the modes were standardizing on

172
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,153
and tests proved that we could have enough AI

173
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:06,635
in one bubble to support 4v4.

174
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:10,078
But if we put both arenas in one bubble,

175
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:12,059
that would be easier to get up and running

176
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,200
and lower technical risk.

177
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,281
So, we chose that option.

178
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:18,643
We specifically chose it because of the lower technical risk.

179
00:08:18,983 --> 00:08:22,045
It allowed us to get started immediately on the gameplay

180
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:24,807
and not worry so much about the tech.

181
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:27,549
This wound up paying off later

182
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:29,570
when we introduced a key new mechanic,

183
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,272
which would have been a lot more difficult to implement

184
00:08:32,472 --> 00:08:33,773
had we been in two separate bubbles,

185
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,014
and I'll talk about that in a bit.

186
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:38,276
So, we threw together a test map.

187
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:40,986
And the first thing we wanted to do

188
00:08:41,026 --> 00:08:43,388
was basically recreate Firefight from Halo

189
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:44,909
inside the Destiny engine.

190
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,611
And so we threw together this map

191
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,073
where we had one team on each side of the map.

192
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:50,795
And that big white block down the middle

193
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:53,077
was a transparent glass wall between them.

194
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,591
It was immediately fun because we had the luxury of building on top of the Destiny sandbox.

195
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:07,292
And I want to emphasize that Gambit's success is due in large part to all of the work that

196
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:09,993
went on in the game prior to this team coming together.

197
00:09:10,293 --> 00:09:13,914
We were building on top of some really solid foundations and we really took advantage of

198
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:14,094
that.

199
00:09:14,774 --> 00:09:17,095
So we got a lot of things for free.

200
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:18,435
I put that in air quotes.

201
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,192
because the Destiny sandbox is inherently fun.

202
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:25,454
We thought that seeing the other arena

203
00:09:25,914 --> 00:09:28,796
was going to be critical to feeling like you were competing

204
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:31,418
and not being isolated in your own separate space.

205
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:34,800
But in practice, it kind of was more like this.

206
00:09:35,981 --> 00:09:37,702
It was super distracting,

207
00:09:38,423 --> 00:09:40,564
and it created chaos and confusion.

208
00:09:40,604 --> 00:09:43,406
And pretty quickly, we decided to kill that glass wall.

209
00:09:44,868 --> 00:09:48,629
We talked about adding holograms, shadows on the ground

210
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:51,230
in your arena, projected video walls that show you

211
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,730
what's going on in the other side,

212
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,811
but we didn't have the tech for most of that stuff,

213
00:09:55,431 --> 00:09:57,712
and we were focused on low technical risk,

214
00:09:57,772 --> 00:10:00,272
focused on the gameplay, so we just kind of proceeded

215
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:03,873
without it, and it wound up being just fine as it was.

216
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:09,458
One place we did want a glass wall was the ready room,

217
00:10:09,498 --> 00:10:11,580
and this was a new thing for us in Destiny.

218
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,701
Teams were going to be in separate arenas,

219
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,583
and for perf reasons, we couldn't have viewpoints

220
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:18,025
from one arena to another.

221
00:10:18,105 --> 00:10:19,686
That would kind of defeat the whole purpose

222
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:21,747
of putting you in separate places to begin with.

223
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,868
We would lose the advantages

224
00:10:22,908 --> 00:10:24,349
of being able to support more AI.

225
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,671
So we wanted to start the match

226
00:10:26,891 --> 00:10:29,153
somewhere where each team could see the other.

227
00:10:30,201 --> 00:10:32,662
And this established the sense of competition at the outset

228
00:10:32,702 --> 00:10:35,163
while giving players a chance to have fun with emotes

229
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,564
and change their loadouts based on what they saw.

230
00:10:37,944 --> 00:10:40,425
And we prototyped this very early in the Gambit process.

231
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,406
We also knew that we were going to have

232
00:10:42,446 --> 00:10:43,807
an announcer for this game that we

233
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:46,608
wanted to put in that space with the players, which is something

234
00:10:46,628 --> 00:10:48,049
that we hadn't done before in Destiny.

235
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:50,590
So we wanted to bring that announcer into the game

236
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,931
experience, and the Ready Room was our solution to that.

237
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:57,783
We knew we wanted one team's gameplay

238
00:10:57,883 --> 00:10:58,943
to affect the other team,

239
00:10:59,303 --> 00:11:00,723
but we didn't know exactly how yet.

240
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,384
It was a pretty important thing.

241
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:04,224
We brainstormed a lot of ideas,

242
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,645
and we were calling interferences at the time.

243
00:11:06,705 --> 00:11:09,866
They were all fine, and you can see those ideas up there,

244
00:11:10,246 --> 00:11:12,726
but there was nothing that really got us excited,

245
00:11:12,987 --> 00:11:14,307
and the million-dollar question

246
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:16,407
that we heard a lot internally was,

247
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:20,288
if I can't see the other team, why do I care about them?

248
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:23,309
And we hadn't come up with a good answer to this,

249
00:11:23,509 --> 00:11:25,210
and it was a really critical question.

250
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,642
So our inability to solve this problem

251
00:11:31,663 --> 00:11:35,325
led us to question our no direct team

252
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:37,107
versus team interaction pillar.

253
00:11:39,488 --> 00:11:41,750
One of the easiest interferences for us to prototype

254
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:44,472
was transporting a member of your team to the other side.

255
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:46,233
Super easy for us to do.

256
00:11:46,814 --> 00:11:48,215
And we knew if we never tried it,

257
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:50,716
we were always going to be asked,

258
00:11:51,237 --> 00:11:53,398
why can't I shoot the other team, right?

259
00:11:54,357 --> 00:11:55,838
We knew it was going to come from management,

260
00:11:56,238 --> 00:11:57,159
other people in the studio.

261
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:58,500
It was going to come from players and people

262
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,081
who just, well, why can't I shoot the other guys?

263
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:04,325
And we didn't have a good answer for that, other than lofty

264
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:05,026
design goals.

265
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:06,987
We didn't have a practical, real answer.

266
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:09,309
We thought, we should try it.

267
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:11,311
We should at least give it a shot and see how it feels.

268
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:14,213
So we did.

269
00:12:15,675 --> 00:12:18,117
And it worked really, really well.

270
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,679
From the very first play test, we

271
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:22,861
knew we had something special with this mechanic.

272
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:26,602
It created a PvP role on the team.

273
00:12:28,363 --> 00:12:31,463
Obviously, it introduced direct team-on-team contact,

274
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:33,184
which is much more visceral.

275
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,285
It created some strategic trade-offs

276
00:12:36,405 --> 00:12:37,225
that you had to balance.

277
00:12:37,325 --> 00:12:39,085
If you're sending someone over to the other side,

278
00:12:39,145 --> 00:12:41,766
that means your team is now one man down on your own side.

279
00:12:42,886 --> 00:12:44,647
It created watchable hero moments.

280
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,888
One v. four, that's drama, inherent drama right there.

281
00:12:49,008 --> 00:12:51,089
And if you're one, can beat their four,

282
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:52,909
you feel like a god.

283
00:12:54,418 --> 00:12:58,859
It broke up the PvE gameplay, created nice moments where now,

284
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,640
instead of only fighting against the mobs,

285
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,101
suddenly there was a human threat in the arena,

286
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:04,842
which radically changes your behavior

287
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:05,942
and your approach to the game.

288
00:13:07,223 --> 00:13:08,983
So that created high drama and tension.

289
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:11,604
And our playtesters loved it.

290
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,846
It was clearly going to be our secret sauce for this mode.

291
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:18,527
And once we had it, we knew we couldn't possibly let it go.

292
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:21,348
So...

293
00:13:23,615 --> 00:13:25,116
say goodbye to one of our pillars.

294
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:29,579
We recognized that the playing field, if you will,

295
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:32,121
had changed, and we had found some magic,

296
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:34,142
and just because we had a pillar up there

297
00:13:34,182 --> 00:13:35,463
that said that we weren't gonna do

298
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,104
that particular magic spell,

299
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:38,565
it doesn't mean we're gonna banish it.

300
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,166
We're gonna use it, because we found it.

301
00:13:42,328 --> 00:13:44,229
But we didn't want Gambit to just be about

302
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:45,570
racking up the most kills,

303
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,372
and we already had a race through a physical space

304
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:49,293
in the form of strikes.

305
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:52,720
We knew we wanted it to be round-based

306
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,760
so that players could have a fresh start every few minutes

307
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,241
and enable some comebacks.

308
00:13:57,661 --> 00:13:59,601
And so that is why Gambit has moats.

309
00:14:01,462 --> 00:14:03,962
Moats did a bunch of really great things for us.

310
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:06,543
It forces players to unturtle in order

311
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:07,943
to collect and deposit their moats.

312
00:14:07,963 --> 00:14:09,824
You can't just find a nice piece of cover,

313
00:14:10,144 --> 00:14:12,084
hunker down, and go at the bad guys.

314
00:14:12,224 --> 00:14:13,845
You actually have to get out and do something.

315
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,593
We created a much stronger gameplay loop.

316
00:14:18,094 --> 00:14:20,196
When we started, we had a gameplay loop

317
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:21,478
that was just one node.

318
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:24,181
Kill, kill, kill, kind of repetitive.

319
00:14:24,642 --> 00:14:25,883
But instead of just killing now,

320
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:28,947
you're constantly cycling through kill, collect, deposit.

321
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:32,792
It's a much more interesting gameplay loop for the mode.

322
00:14:35,226 --> 00:14:38,828
Having motes introduces a drop rate dial that we can turn,

323
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:40,789
which was a useful thing to have for tuning.

324
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:42,550
We could make harder enemies worth more.

325
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,092
We could adjust the drop rate based on team performance.

326
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:46,293
It gave us some options.

327
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:50,515
And that explosion of motes was a dopamine rush.

328
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:52,256
Every time you kill something,

329
00:14:52,596 --> 00:14:55,518
and that AI goes poof,

330
00:14:55,778 --> 00:14:57,099
and you get that mote floating out,

331
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,540
you feel really good,

332
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,381
and it drives you forward to collect it.

333
00:15:04,464 --> 00:15:06,206
So the next thing to happen once we had our moats

334
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:09,069
was blockers, which we originally called

335
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:12,152
interference squads, but thankfully we shortened it

336
00:15:12,393 --> 00:15:13,354
internally and externally.

337
00:15:13,874 --> 00:15:15,376
They were one of our earliest ideas.

338
00:15:15,396 --> 00:15:17,398
It just took a while to get around to adding them

339
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:19,280
because we were focused on getting some of the other

340
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,082
foundational elements in play first.

341
00:15:23,094 --> 00:15:27,400
When you think about it, blockers are actually a pretty natural outgrowth of the initial

342
00:15:27,441 --> 00:15:33,930
pitch of firefight meets super puzzle fighter, because in super puzzle fighter, you match

343
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,275
gems and you send garbage to the other team, right?

344
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:37,956
You're doing well.

345
00:15:38,857 --> 00:15:40,498
make things more difficult for the opponent.

346
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,320
So in Destiny, what's our equivalent of that?

347
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:45,402
Well, you're gonna be killing AI in this mode,

348
00:15:45,922 --> 00:15:48,824
and then you send garbage AI to the other team

349
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:50,886
that do not help them win.

350
00:15:50,946 --> 00:15:52,767
They don't drop the motes that they're looking for,

351
00:15:52,807 --> 00:15:54,548
and in fact, they actively block them.

352
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:55,869
Oh, we'll call them blockers.

353
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:02,574
So to make players care about dealing with the blockers,

354
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:05,156
we made them lock down the targeted team's bank

355
00:16:05,616 --> 00:16:06,597
so that they couldn't deposit.

356
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:10,874
This meant that it made sense to then drop the blockers

357
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:13,076
at the bank rather than elsewhere on the map.

358
00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:15,217
And so that reinforced the relationship.

359
00:16:15,277 --> 00:16:16,777
Blockers, bank, there's a connection.

360
00:16:16,797 --> 00:16:17,598
That's why they're there.

361
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:21,280
We also made all the other AI spawn away from the bank.

362
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,921
The bank is always a safe zone from those other AI.

363
00:16:24,661 --> 00:16:26,082
So the blockers role was clear.

364
00:16:26,802 --> 00:16:29,964
This created a new team role for getting rid of blockers

365
00:16:30,284 --> 00:16:31,305
and keeping the bank open.

366
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:34,406
But something was still missing.

367
00:16:35,622 --> 00:16:39,666
Ending a round by filling the bank often felt anticlimactic.

368
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:41,147
The end could kind of sneak up on you.

369
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:44,691
You would be scattered across the map hunting down AI,

370
00:16:45,692 --> 00:16:47,053
and suddenly the round would end.

371
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:50,196
And it'd be hard for a trailing team to make a comeback.

372
00:16:50,897 --> 00:16:52,598
So that's where the primeval came from.

373
00:16:54,124 --> 00:16:58,870
We had a tiebreaker in effect that if the timer ran out

374
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,273
and no team had filled up their bank yet,

375
00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:04,096
then we would spawn a really beefy blocker.

376
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:07,861
And the first team to kill that blocker

377
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,423
and then make a deposit would win the round.

378
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:13,384
When it finally triggered naturally for the first time in a playtest,

379
00:17:13,684 --> 00:17:14,605
people went nuts.

380
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:17,045
The playtesters absolutely loved it.

381
00:17:17,365 --> 00:17:20,646
There was an energy to the end of the round that hadn't existed before.

382
00:17:20,986 --> 00:17:23,107
And we realized that the answer to our problem

383
00:17:23,187 --> 00:17:25,067
had been hidden in the game all along,

384
00:17:25,407 --> 00:17:28,328
and we just hadn't really played with it enough.

385
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:32,809
So, this also gave us a couple of unexpected upsides.

386
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:36,961
a greater variety of loadouts now became viable within the game.

387
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:39,483
When we didn't have the Primeval

388
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:41,865
and you were just dealing with a bunch of waves of enemies,

389
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:46,129
you wanted a particular set of tools at your disposal.

390
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:48,891
But now, in addition to dealing with mobs,

391
00:17:49,412 --> 00:17:51,934
you had a place for tools that dealt with the boss.

392
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:56,538
Support, mob control, boss control,

393
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:58,139
a mix of those suddenly had a place.

394
00:17:59,065 --> 00:18:00,946
It brought the whole team together at the end of the round

395
00:18:00,966 --> 00:18:02,867
because now you're all focusing on the same target.

396
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:03,907
So you can see each other,

397
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:05,487
you can cheer each other's successes.

398
00:18:06,468 --> 00:18:08,768
And the round endings became much more exciting

399
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:09,889
and more watchable.

400
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:15,411
So now we had all of the basic building blocks

401
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:18,692
that you recognize from Gambit today in place,

402
00:18:18,752 --> 00:18:20,472
but they were in a very raw state.

403
00:18:20,572 --> 00:18:22,753
And so we did a lot of iteration.

404
00:18:23,193 --> 00:18:24,213
And let's start with the blockers.

405
00:18:27,634 --> 00:18:27,794
Sorry.

406
00:18:29,738 --> 00:18:30,979
Since the blockers don't drop motes,

407
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:33,101
we needed blockers to be visually distinct

408
00:18:33,141 --> 00:18:33,842
from other enemies.

409
00:18:34,122 --> 00:18:35,743
And players needed to distinguish

410
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:39,066
between mote-dropping enemies and non-mote-dropping enemies,

411
00:18:39,126 --> 00:18:42,149
because that really affects what your choices are going to be.

412
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:45,592
But our combatants team didn't have resources

413
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:48,274
to give us a new visual treatment for our blockers.

414
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,096
So that was kind of a conundrum for us.

415
00:18:51,537 --> 00:18:54,240
Fortunately, the game already had taken.

416
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,908
For those of you who aren't familiar with Destiny,

417
00:18:57,388 --> 00:18:59,389
Taken is a version of our combatants

418
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:01,729
that have a completely different visual treatment.

419
00:19:01,769 --> 00:19:02,889
They kind of look black and white,

420
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,990
whereas all the other enemies are in full color,

421
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,450
and they have some different abilities

422
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,411
than the normal versions of them do, different sounds.

423
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:11,151
They look and feel quite different,

424
00:19:11,211 --> 00:19:13,552
although their silhouettes are very recognizable

425
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,372
as the enemies that they are based on.

426
00:19:16,312 --> 00:19:19,073
So we decided to make all of our blockers Taken,

427
00:19:19,613 --> 00:19:22,534
and never use Taken in any other context within the mode.

428
00:19:24,145 --> 00:19:25,826
This had a number of bang-on effects.

429
00:19:28,287 --> 00:19:31,229
So, backstory and ready room appearance

430
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:34,351
were drastically impacted by this decision.

431
00:19:34,411 --> 00:19:37,973
We were developing the Drifter, a new NPC to host Gambit.

432
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:40,554
And as we leaned into this idea

433
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:42,275
that our blockers were going to be taken,

434
00:19:42,995 --> 00:19:44,876
his backstory started to take shape.

435
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:48,197
Here's a guy who's been out there in some mysterious place

436
00:19:48,678 --> 00:19:50,518
and he's come back with technology

437
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:52,979
that taps into forces that guardians

438
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,900
don't usually play with, right?

439
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,821
That's some rich, meaty stuff.

440
00:19:56,981 --> 00:19:57,761
Who is this guy?

441
00:19:57,901 --> 00:19:58,562
What is he after?

442
00:19:58,582 --> 00:20:01,303
And that kind of started with the decision

443
00:20:01,483 --> 00:20:02,503
to make the blockers taken.

444
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:07,596
The ready room, which you saw in our white box version,

445
00:20:08,176 --> 00:20:09,717
back at the beginning of the deck,

446
00:20:10,117 --> 00:20:11,917
started to look like this now, because we

447
00:20:11,957 --> 00:20:14,218
knew that we wanted to bring this whole taken

448
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:15,999
aesthetic into his space.

449
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,880
You can see those forces behind him in his ship

450
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,680
as he introduces the match.

451
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,201
And this also opened up a lot of great narrative opportunities

452
00:20:25,241 --> 00:20:25,541
for us.

453
00:20:25,581 --> 00:20:29,022
We talked a lot at the beginning of the Gambit gestation

454
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,223
process about the moral and ethical implications of Gambit.

455
00:20:32,964 --> 00:20:34,764
Where did the aliens that you're fighting come from?

456
00:20:34,784 --> 00:20:36,364
Were they willing participants?

457
00:20:36,464 --> 00:20:38,465
Is this some kind of galactic fight club?

458
00:20:39,085 --> 00:20:42,165
And the drifter and his technology

459
00:20:42,305 --> 00:20:45,446
started to help address a lot of those questions for us,

460
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:48,466
partly by making them a little bit less important.

461
00:20:51,947 --> 00:20:55,328
The bank became a swirling vortex of dark energy

462
00:20:55,368 --> 00:20:57,428
that gets more intense as you fill it up.

463
00:20:58,608 --> 00:21:00,349
The invasion portal also used

464
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:02,109
a similar kind of darkness effects.

465
00:21:04,172 --> 00:21:06,993
we made the invaders effects echo the taken.

466
00:21:07,594 --> 00:21:10,336
It was originally all black, but in play tests,

467
00:21:10,696 --> 00:21:14,378
the invader would very often get confused with the blockers.

468
00:21:14,758 --> 00:21:17,260
When you're a defender, you really wanna be able

469
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,261
to identify the human that's coming at you.

470
00:21:19,642 --> 00:21:24,024
And so we kept a lot of the same trail style

471
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:26,686
that the taken have, but we gave it a red tint

472
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:29,208
instead of a more white tint that the taken have.

473
00:21:30,969 --> 00:21:32,050
And speaking of those blockers,

474
00:21:33,301 --> 00:21:36,864
They originally got created when a team crossed a bank threshold.

475
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:39,526
So that was the mechanic that we eventually settled on

476
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:41,127
for activating the invasion portal.

477
00:21:41,687 --> 00:21:43,568
But it felt too passive for the blockers.

478
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:47,892
In playtests, players continually expressed this desire

479
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,674
to pay off the risk versus reward

480
00:21:50,734 --> 00:21:52,455
that they were feeling with collecting motes.

481
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:55,717
Originally, motes were uncapped.

482
00:21:56,078 --> 00:21:58,900
You as a player could carry as many motes

483
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,141
as you wanted around with you before depositing.

484
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,962
And if you're frustrated at people dying with 15 moats today,

485
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,763
you can only imagine the rage that you might feel

486
00:22:09,103 --> 00:22:10,184
if we had left it uncapped.

487
00:22:11,324 --> 00:22:14,866
And the unbridled joy you would get at depositing 30 at once.

488
00:22:15,246 --> 00:22:16,687
But we wanted to pay off the risk.

489
00:22:16,727 --> 00:22:18,487
If we were letting you carry more moats,

490
00:22:18,507 --> 00:22:20,248
there had to be some kind of payoff to that.

491
00:22:20,628 --> 00:22:23,550
So we made the bank serve as a kind of a vending machine

492
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,410
for blockers.

493
00:22:25,141 --> 00:22:27,302
And we changed which blockers you get

494
00:22:27,742 --> 00:22:29,083
based on how many you deposit.

495
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:32,825
So five small, 10 medium, 15 large.

496
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:34,826
And this created a really strong connection

497
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:37,468
between player action and blocker creation.

498
00:22:37,548 --> 00:22:40,029
Players understood the cause and effect very clearly.

499
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:42,350
It also introduced more strategic choices.

500
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,692
Timing to maximize bank shutdown.

501
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:49,374
Now if I time my blocker to your blocker

502
00:22:49,514 --> 00:22:50,735
and then the invader goes over,

503
00:22:50,775 --> 00:22:52,916
that's a whole strategic ballet

504
00:22:53,257 --> 00:22:54,357
that your team is performing.

505
00:22:57,966 --> 00:23:01,029
Our first pass had the small blocker as a taken scion,

506
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,993
which in our game is a very small, agile enemy,

507
00:23:05,513 --> 00:23:06,594
but not much of a threat.

508
00:23:07,435 --> 00:23:08,897
It felt too inconsequential.

509
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:11,179
So we changed it to a taken phalanx,

510
00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:13,301
which has a shield that makes it harder to kill

511
00:23:13,361 --> 00:23:14,963
and also pushes players back,

512
00:23:15,363 --> 00:23:16,804
making it much more of an annoyance.

513
00:23:17,505 --> 00:23:18,146
And in fact,

514
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,410
As we played the game more in live,

515
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,531
we realized that we had actually over-corrected.

516
00:23:23,551 --> 00:23:26,011
And the failings gave you way too much utility

517
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,292
for depositing five motes.

518
00:23:27,312 --> 00:23:29,952
If you think about it, just getting your mote safely

519
00:23:29,972 --> 00:23:32,033
into the bank is a heck of a lot of utility

520
00:23:32,093 --> 00:23:33,093
for that five deposit.

521
00:23:33,213 --> 00:23:35,694
So giving you a pretty strong blocker in addition

522
00:23:36,034 --> 00:23:36,674
was overboard.

523
00:23:37,054 --> 00:23:38,794
And so there was a really strong strategy

524
00:23:38,814 --> 00:23:40,175
of just depositing fives.

525
00:23:40,215 --> 00:23:41,315
And that's not what we wanted.

526
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:44,536
So we just changed it again to another type of unit

527
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:45,516
to improve the balance.

528
00:23:47,201 --> 00:23:51,806
The large blocker was originally a wizard, which flies and has a strong ranged attack,

529
00:23:51,826 --> 00:23:53,747
but it didn't feel large.

530
00:23:54,248 --> 00:23:57,932
And so we swapped it out for a taken ogre, which is one of our largest combatants.

531
00:23:58,472 --> 00:24:03,397
It's got a massive size and a lethal beam attack, which better fulfilled the promise

532
00:24:03,517 --> 00:24:04,438
of a large blocker.

533
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:07,602
We also played around with the health of all the blockers

534
00:24:07,662 --> 00:24:10,164
to make them beefier than normal, but not overwhelming.

535
00:24:10,244 --> 00:24:11,584
Originally, they were tanks.

536
00:24:11,945 --> 00:24:13,525
They were really difficult to get rid of,

537
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:16,227
and it was just too much, so we played around a lot

538
00:24:16,267 --> 00:24:18,028
in the iteration process with how strong

539
00:24:18,068 --> 00:24:18,969
the blockers should be.

540
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:22,851
For invasion.

541
00:24:23,992 --> 00:24:27,416
We wanted the invader to feel like a one-person wrecking crew,

542
00:24:27,496 --> 00:24:30,920
but not feel unfair to the team that they're invading.

543
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:35,425
So we balanced the fact that it was one player against four

544
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:39,270
with an overshield to give you a little more survivability

545
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,632
and randomizing the spawn points to give

546
00:24:41,672 --> 00:24:42,814
the invader a fair chance.

547
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,371
We also talked a lot about whether the invader should have a special attack.

548
00:24:47,431 --> 00:24:49,052
We're giving you this taken treatment.

549
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:51,753
The drifter even tells you that this is what the taken feel,

550
00:24:51,893 --> 00:24:53,354
revel in it when you go over.

551
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:57,195
And so we thought, well, maybe you should have a special attack as a taken.

552
00:24:58,015 --> 00:25:00,217
We had decided not to do that for a couple of reasons.

553
00:25:01,398 --> 00:25:04,340
One, it would be another complex element to learn

554
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,782
in a mode that was already full of a lot of things

555
00:25:06,823 --> 00:25:09,165
you needed to learn, and so we wanted to simplify.

556
00:25:10,185 --> 00:25:12,688
Second, it would eliminate the strategic choices

557
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:13,669
that you had in your loadout.

558
00:25:13,729 --> 00:25:15,470
If now they didn't matter as an invader,

559
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,393
we were taking away a pretty strong aspect

560
00:25:18,413 --> 00:25:19,814
of personalization and choice.

561
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:23,397
So in the end, we let the invader use their own loadout.

562
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,422
The defenders have numeric advantage.

563
00:25:29,002 --> 00:25:31,424
But we needed to make sure that players felt it was fair

564
00:25:31,464 --> 00:25:32,484
when an invader came over.

565
00:25:32,905 --> 00:25:36,787
And so we attacked that problem by having lots of vectors

566
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:39,329
to inform the team about what was happening.

567
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:40,890
The drifter calls it out.

568
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,531
He announces that you're being invaded.

569
00:25:43,472 --> 00:25:46,073
There's an alarm klaxon that sounds throughout the arena.

570
00:25:46,794 --> 00:25:48,095
The whole screen turns red.

571
00:25:48,175 --> 00:25:50,296
The arena kind of fills with a red fog

572
00:25:50,376 --> 00:25:51,897
to indicate the state change.

573
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:53,899
And there's a HUD element that flashes

574
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:55,200
that there's an invasion going on

575
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,861
and gives you the countdown to how long you have left, right?

576
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:00,283
Lots of cues.

577
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:03,545
The visual effects make the invaders stand out

578
00:26:03,585 --> 00:26:04,466
when you do spot them.

579
00:26:05,347 --> 00:26:07,188
There's nothing else in the game that is moving

580
00:26:07,228 --> 00:26:08,849
that is glowing red but the invader.

581
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:12,314
and the invader always spawns in an empty front

582
00:26:12,694 --> 00:26:15,917
and has to close the distance or snipe from far away.

583
00:26:16,477 --> 00:26:18,699
So you're never gonna have the invader spawn

584
00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:22,502
right next to you, which can happen sometimes in PvP

585
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:24,103
and doesn't really feel good.

586
00:26:24,123 --> 00:26:25,544
So we made sure that that was not

587
00:26:25,824 --> 00:26:26,905
going to be a consideration.

588
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:31,700
This is what motes look like in the ship game.

589
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,802
But man, did it take a long time to get there.

590
00:26:36,182 --> 00:26:37,923
It seems like such a simple thing, right?

591
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:42,044
But it went through a lot of changes.

592
00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:44,345
This is what they started looking like.

593
00:26:44,926 --> 00:26:46,466
It looked just like our engrams.

594
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:48,307
They rolled a lot.

595
00:26:48,567 --> 00:26:51,568
They're dodecahedrons, they drop, and they would roll.

596
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:54,250
Which was interesting, but it was frustrating

597
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,630
to have the motes roll away from you,

598
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:58,191
especially if you killed something on a hill or on a ramp.

599
00:26:59,052 --> 00:27:00,493
and it was frustrating to have the moats

600
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:03,394
get blown across the map by grenades and explosions.

601
00:27:03,794 --> 00:27:06,156
So we increased their weight to help them stay in place,

602
00:27:06,196 --> 00:27:07,657
but not necessarily lock them down,

603
00:27:07,717 --> 00:27:10,298
but resist the likelihood that they were going

604
00:27:10,318 --> 00:27:11,499
to get blown across the map.

605
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:14,261
And we changed their shape to make them distinctive

606
00:27:14,621 --> 00:27:15,582
and to make them not roll.

607
00:27:17,263 --> 00:27:19,484
But their appearance and the feedback states

608
00:27:19,684 --> 00:27:21,345
went through a lot of iteration.

609
00:27:22,025 --> 00:27:23,686
So initially, this is what they looked like

610
00:27:23,706 --> 00:27:24,427
in our prototypes.

611
00:27:25,448 --> 00:27:26,728
You'll notice it's purple.

612
00:27:27,915 --> 00:27:29,917
We didn't spend a lot of time on treatment at that point.

613
00:27:30,337 --> 00:27:31,698
And it has a waypoint right above it.

614
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:34,861
That waypoint also has a timer, a numeric timer,

615
00:27:34,881 --> 00:27:37,382
showing you how long it's going to be before the moat goes away.

616
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,024
We felt that was really important information

617
00:27:39,044 --> 00:27:39,804
to the player to have.

618
00:27:40,445 --> 00:27:42,186
If there's a moat on the ground that's brand new,

619
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:44,147
and there's a moat on the ground that's going to disappear

620
00:27:44,187 --> 00:27:46,589
in five seconds, we want the player to know about it

621
00:27:46,609 --> 00:27:48,491
so we can pick up the five-second moat first.

622
00:27:51,813 --> 00:27:53,755
Then as we doubled down on taken,

623
00:27:54,957 --> 00:27:57,698
The taken energy kind of infiltrated the motes,

624
00:27:58,278 --> 00:27:59,699
and they started to look like this.

625
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,660
We pretty quickly realized that we'd gone

626
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,641
a little bit too far here, that these weren't attractive.

627
00:28:05,721 --> 00:28:07,762
They didn't look like things that I as a player

628
00:28:07,842 --> 00:28:08,683
want to be picking up.

629
00:28:08,723 --> 00:28:10,143
In fact, they look a lot like blights,

630
00:28:10,243 --> 00:28:12,945
which in our game are a big negative thing

631
00:28:12,965 --> 00:28:14,505
that you always are asked to shoot.

632
00:28:15,306 --> 00:28:17,947
So we wound up backing away from that change,

633
00:28:18,887 --> 00:28:21,548
and that's when we started to investigate the whole pyramid.

634
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:24,130
At this point.

635
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:26,777
The live game introduced something

636
00:28:27,437 --> 00:28:28,858
that was also a gold pyramid.

637
00:28:29,298 --> 00:28:30,779
When you pick up something that we call

638
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:32,299
an exotic catalyst in the game,

639
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,561
when it drops in the world, it drops as a gold pyramid.

640
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,722
And so now we have something else that drops

641
00:28:37,762 --> 00:28:40,643
that looked exactly like what we were making.

642
00:28:41,484 --> 00:28:44,785
So we had to change how we were presenting that pyramid

643
00:28:44,805 --> 00:28:46,746
and wound up getting a couple of different treatments.

644
00:28:47,849 --> 00:28:51,113
We also noted that moats can be hard to spot

645
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:53,757
when they're on another level of the map.

646
00:28:54,017 --> 00:28:57,381
A lot of our maps for Gambit have verticality by design,

647
00:28:57,862 --> 00:28:59,303
which means there are ledges and things

648
00:28:59,323 --> 00:29:00,485
that the moats could appear under,

649
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:03,308
and you could be standing right above a moat and not know it.

650
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:07,193
So we added the vertical beam to help players find them.

651
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,860
One of the biggest point of contentions

652
00:29:11,261 --> 00:29:14,262
was around feedback when a moat was about to expire and despawn.

653
00:29:14,842 --> 00:29:17,883
Originally, they emitted a kind of expanding pulse,

654
00:29:18,063 --> 00:29:19,604
and then they flashed red.

655
00:29:20,684 --> 00:29:22,865
And red was a big danger sign.

656
00:29:22,905 --> 00:29:26,067
We use red elsewhere in the game to mean bad things.

657
00:29:26,687 --> 00:29:29,028
And in fact, a lot of players wound up

658
00:29:29,108 --> 00:29:31,289
running away from those moats instead of toward them

659
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:33,290
because they thought they were going to explode.

660
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:36,031
Totally reasonable feedback.

661
00:29:36,571 --> 00:29:38,092
So that changed.

662
00:29:43,557 --> 00:29:45,998
We changed to particle effects and flashing,

663
00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:47,960
attenuating the vertical beam.

664
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:51,703
Played around a lot with the speed of the flash,

665
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:52,843
when it started.

666
00:29:54,485 --> 00:29:55,645
Ultimately, what we wound up with

667
00:29:55,705 --> 00:29:58,307
was a very, very tall vertical beam that would

668
00:29:58,387 --> 00:30:00,169
punch through our geometry.

669
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:02,851
So if something was standing, if something was underneath you,

670
00:30:02,911 --> 00:30:03,611
you would know about it.

671
00:30:03,651 --> 00:30:04,772
You could see it from anywhere.

672
00:30:06,287 --> 00:30:08,269
Instead of having a numeric countdown,

673
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,671
the motes start to emit some particles

674
00:30:10,731 --> 00:30:13,054
as they're getting close to disappearing

675
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,516
and getting more intense until finally

676
00:30:15,556 --> 00:30:17,478
they just kind of go pfft and disappear.

677
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:19,900
So rather than reading a number,

678
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,123
we translated all that information into visual data,

679
00:30:23,784 --> 00:30:26,907
which the player was able to process kind of subconsciously

680
00:30:27,007 --> 00:30:29,129
rather than using a different part of their brain

681
00:30:29,209 --> 00:30:30,030
to interpret a number.

682
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,870
And in the game, it winds up all working and coming together

683
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,351
pretty well.

684
00:30:34,671 --> 00:30:36,491
But you can see this is a long process.

685
00:30:36,551 --> 00:30:39,332
Each one of these iterations took quite a bit of time

686
00:30:39,392 --> 00:30:40,072
and feedback.

687
00:30:40,152 --> 00:30:42,973
And it was a long, long time before we actually

688
00:30:43,013 --> 00:30:45,174
landed on the moat that you see in the game, which

689
00:30:45,194 --> 00:30:47,175
for something that seems so simple

690
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:49,755
is just a pretty interesting thing about development.

691
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:54,482
As far as the mode economy goes, we also iterated there.

692
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,104
Invaders originally dropped five when you killed them

693
00:30:57,164 --> 00:30:59,606
because we wanted players to get rewarded

694
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:00,646
for stopping an invader.

695
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:02,288
It felt like a really big accomplishment.

696
00:31:02,328 --> 00:31:03,889
You've killed the human among you.

697
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:05,309
You should get something for that.

698
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,810
But five.

699
00:31:07,591 --> 00:31:10,593
was pretty stiff when we felt that we wanted to encourage

700
00:31:11,274 --> 00:31:14,236
PvE players who we knew we were going to be courting with this mode.

701
00:31:14,276 --> 00:31:16,058
We wanted to encourage them to try invasion.

702
00:31:16,538 --> 00:31:17,839
And if you knew that you,

703
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,902
well, if you didn't feel confident in your PvP abilities

704
00:31:21,182 --> 00:31:23,024
and you knew that going over onto the other side

705
00:31:23,064 --> 00:31:25,305
meant that you were handing the other team five motes,

706
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:28,188
we thought that was going to disincentivize you from going over.

707
00:31:29,028 --> 00:31:30,489
But we still wanted to give something,

708
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:32,630
so we dialed that back from 5 to 3,

709
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:36,251
which felt like a good middle ground of, OK, for 3 motes,

710
00:31:36,391 --> 00:31:37,252
I'll take that risk.

711
00:31:37,332 --> 00:31:40,393
I don't feel so bad if I drop 3 motes as opposed to 5 motes,

712
00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:42,314
which is a whole blocker in and of itself.

713
00:31:44,094 --> 00:31:46,915
We originally played to 100 motes instead of 75,

714
00:31:47,236 --> 00:31:49,677
but we dropped it down to 75 to speed the round up.

715
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:55,910
One thing we get asked a lot, especially in Prime recently

716
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:59,093
that came out, people are asking about why can't we,

717
00:31:59,193 --> 00:32:02,415
why doesn't the collector armor set have a vacuum effect,

718
00:32:02,455 --> 00:32:05,298
right, why can't I suck up motes from a larger distance?

719
00:32:06,018 --> 00:32:07,900
And the truth is that our motes are networked,

720
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,601
so anyone can pick them up.

721
00:32:10,142 --> 00:32:12,323
We had a choice, we could make the motes non-networked,

722
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:13,524
which would have made them faster,

723
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,926
and would have allowed us to do that kind of mote pickup

724
00:32:17,027 --> 00:32:17,988
and adjust the distance.

725
00:32:18,954 --> 00:32:21,455
But that would mean that we were eliminating a role.

726
00:32:21,915 --> 00:32:23,996
If you're the only one who can see your motes,

727
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:26,337
that means that you're the only one who can pick them up.

728
00:32:27,118 --> 00:32:28,978
But the way Gambit is today,

729
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:31,099
you can actually be the collector.

730
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:33,700
You can be the designated person from your team

731
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,841
who's gonna run around and pick up all of those motes.

732
00:32:36,281 --> 00:32:38,142
And so if we made them not networked, that's gone.

733
00:32:38,162 --> 00:32:40,883
And we thought that was a much bigger sacrifice to the game

734
00:32:41,263 --> 00:32:43,865
than having the networked lag that was inherent

735
00:32:43,985 --> 00:32:45,505
in making this a networked object.

736
00:32:46,755 --> 00:32:50,360
So that's why picking them up can sometimes feel a little laggy and non-responsive.

737
00:32:50,701 --> 00:32:54,126
And that's why we can't just enhance the effect and make them wider,

738
00:32:54,146 --> 00:32:56,009
because that would only make the feeling of it worse.

739
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,200
In the motes phase, when an invader kills you,

740
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,161
all of the motes that you're carrying are lost,

741
00:33:03,221 --> 00:33:05,521
but motes don't matter in the primeval phase,

742
00:33:05,581 --> 00:33:06,942
and we didn't feel that kills

743
00:33:06,982 --> 00:33:08,682
during the primeval phase were impactful.

744
00:33:09,282 --> 00:33:11,423
So we made them give health back to the boss.

745
00:33:12,103 --> 00:33:14,263
Finding the right amount was pretty much a matter

746
00:33:14,343 --> 00:33:16,304
of trial and error and playing with different values,

747
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:17,944
and in the end, we settled on about 12%

748
00:33:19,324 --> 00:33:20,965
as being the right value, which meant that

749
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:23,445
if you wiped the entire enemy team,

750
00:33:23,465 --> 00:33:25,386
you killed four enemies, you got 48%,

751
00:33:26,326 --> 00:33:28,167
almost half of the primeval's health back.

752
00:33:29,186 --> 00:33:32,007
that gave your team enough of a margin

753
00:33:32,027 --> 00:33:33,627
that they could potentially come back

754
00:33:34,007 --> 00:33:35,448
and start to regain ground.

755
00:33:35,508 --> 00:33:37,969
And comebacks being possible was one of our pillars.

756
00:33:38,369 --> 00:33:39,429
So this played into that.

757
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,570
We also let the other team invade repeatedly

758
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,651
during this phase so that a team that was behind

759
00:33:45,711 --> 00:33:47,012
had opportunities to catch up.

760
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:50,986
Initially, there was no cool down and it was brutal.

761
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:52,868
It was absolutely brutal.

762
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,293
So we instituted a cool down, which is longer

763
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:58,816
in the primeval phase than it is during the motes phase.

764
00:33:58,836 --> 00:34:00,359
There's now a cool down in both phases

765
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:02,361
and it's a little bit longer when the primeval is up.

766
00:34:05,302 --> 00:34:07,003
So this had a nice side effect,

767
00:34:07,343 --> 00:34:09,825
this allowing players to invade repeatedly,

768
00:34:10,366 --> 00:34:13,068
mitigated the possibility of players camping the portal,

769
00:34:13,088 --> 00:34:15,189
like you'll sometimes see people camping around

770
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,211
heavy ammo in PvP.

771
00:34:18,472 --> 00:34:20,754
We felt like invasion was so much fun

772
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:23,015
that if you wanted to invade

773
00:34:23,055 --> 00:34:24,957
but were constantly robbed of that chance

774
00:34:25,057 --> 00:34:26,818
because somebody went through before you,

775
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:27,839
that was gonna feel bad.

776
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:30,201
And with only two chances to invade at 25 and 50 motes,

777
00:34:32,142 --> 00:34:37,225
there was the very real possibility that you wouldn't get the opportunity to invade in the course of a gambit match.

778
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:42,247
But by opening it up during the primeval phase, now there are many more opportunities to invade.

779
00:34:42,327 --> 00:34:45,669
We can spread that around if there are multiple players who want to have that experience.

780
00:34:48,043 --> 00:34:50,385
I already mentioned incessant invasion was overwhelming,

781
00:34:50,445 --> 00:34:51,546
so we added that cooldown.

782
00:34:52,247 --> 00:34:54,610
And we wanted to prevent instant boss burndowns.

783
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,173
So we added fodder units to distract and harry the team.

784
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:02,338
We delayed spawning the primeval until after the fodder came up,

785
00:35:02,638 --> 00:35:04,360
so you couldn't start damaging it immediately.

786
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,585
We made the primeval super tanky and then added damage multipliers over time to overcome

787
00:35:10,625 --> 00:35:13,587
the tankiness and prevent the round from fizzling out to time.

788
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:18,231
The longer you spend fighting the primeval, the stronger you get against him so that eventually

789
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:21,033
you'll beat him rather than just running out the clock.

790
00:35:22,623 --> 00:35:25,764
We settled on killing special minions that we called envoys,

791
00:35:25,844 --> 00:35:27,544
which are shielded wizards in our game,

792
00:35:27,885 --> 00:35:30,265
as the way that players could accelerate their progress.

793
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:32,186
We experimented with other mechanics,

794
00:35:32,426 --> 00:35:34,027
like having blights that you could shoot

795
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:35,027
and other things like that,

796
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:37,848
but ultimately we realized that simpler was better.

797
00:35:37,908 --> 00:35:41,689
Players already knew that killing AI, good, right?

798
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:44,030
So we'll tap into that primal brain

799
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:46,151
and make killing AI good here.

800
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:47,011
So that's what we did.

801
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,851
We tested a lot of fast burn strategies

802
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,312
to ensure that teams wouldn't kill the primeval

803
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:54,913
before other teams had a chance

804
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:56,433
to at least send over an invader

805
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:59,634
and buy their team some time.

806
00:36:00,655 --> 00:36:02,835
Now the sandbox evolved over time

807
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:04,056
to give the players more power,

808
00:36:04,436 --> 00:36:06,497
and so as the game was out there for a while,

809
00:36:07,037 --> 00:36:09,498
player power kind of started to eclipse the game mechanics.

810
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,520
There's a lot going on in Gambit.

811
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:17,262
It's a very complex mode when you compare it to, say, Clash,

812
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,142
which is straightforward, just kill as many guys as you can.

813
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:22,143
So we had a lot of critical information

814
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:23,644
that we wanted to communicate to the player.

815
00:36:23,944 --> 00:36:26,445
And we iterated a lot on how to do that most effectively,

816
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:28,065
what's the most vital and what to leave out.

817
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:31,186
It was a challenge to present all this information

818
00:36:31,446 --> 00:36:34,427
on our HUD, but not clutter up the screen too much

819
00:36:34,487 --> 00:36:36,488
and get in the way of what you really want to see.

820
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:38,849
And one of the places that we think was most successful

821
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:39,709
was with our moat bar.

822
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,825
That's up at the top of the screen.

823
00:36:43,005 --> 00:36:44,045
I'll give you a close-up here.

824
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:48,488
The colored bars show how many motes each team has deposited,

825
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,870
while the gray extensions on those bars

826
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,312
show how many motes each team is carrying.

827
00:36:54,152 --> 00:36:56,854
This made an immediate and strong impact

828
00:36:56,954 --> 00:36:58,835
on player understanding of the game state.

829
00:36:59,536 --> 00:37:01,157
Before we had this in, there was no way

830
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,258
to tell how many motes the other team had,

831
00:37:03,658 --> 00:37:06,340
which meant your invasion timing was effectively random.

832
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:09,422
But now, you could see the state of the other team,

833
00:37:09,622 --> 00:37:10,863
and you could time your invasions

834
00:37:10,903 --> 00:37:12,104
to have the greatest impact.

835
00:37:13,624 --> 00:37:16,188
You could also see how many moats the other team had

836
00:37:16,248 --> 00:37:17,972
and whether they had an invasion available.

837
00:37:18,412 --> 00:37:20,456
So if you're walking around with 12 moats,

838
00:37:21,118 --> 00:37:23,221
maybe instead of hunting for three more

839
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,404
to get that large blocker,

840
00:37:24,424 --> 00:37:26,447
you'll just get your butt to the bank and put them in.

841
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:31,193
Hash marks in the note bar show when those invasions will

842
00:37:31,254 --> 00:37:32,895
activate, and icons above the bar

843
00:37:32,935 --> 00:37:35,037
appear when an invasion is available.

844
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:37,220
So a glance at this bar tells you

845
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,023
all the most vital information about the global game state.

846
00:37:40,463 --> 00:37:44,067
Originally, we had the timer and what blockers were currently

847
00:37:44,167 --> 00:37:45,989
up up here as well, but we removed them

848
00:37:46,029 --> 00:37:48,291
to simplify and focus the player on the most

849
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:49,453
important information.

850
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:51,495
We still show them when you're dead.

851
00:37:52,155 --> 00:37:53,817
or when you're in nav mode, if you ever do that,

852
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:55,077
if there's a button that you can press

853
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:56,018
that brings up your ghost,

854
00:37:56,078 --> 00:37:57,299
and when you're in that mode,

855
00:37:57,379 --> 00:37:59,140
which means you're not actively shooting,

856
00:37:59,721 --> 00:38:02,103
we'll show you that extra information for you to process,

857
00:38:02,143 --> 00:38:03,964
but we take it away when you're in the heat

858
00:38:04,024 --> 00:38:05,085
of actual combat.

859
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:10,709
Understanding what was happening moment to moment

860
00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:14,091
was still difficult until we started adding our VO.

861
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,921
It was really, really valuable to get somebody,

862
00:38:18,221 --> 00:38:21,182
in this case it was me, to record temp VO

863
00:38:21,783 --> 00:38:23,063
for everything we thought we wanted

864
00:38:23,283 --> 00:38:24,743
as early as we possibly could.

865
00:38:25,724 --> 00:38:27,885
Initially, we were way too chatty.

866
00:38:28,465 --> 00:38:31,486
We talked all the time, and when that happens,

867
00:38:31,526 --> 00:38:32,926
you start tuning the announcer out,

868
00:38:32,966 --> 00:38:34,607
and so you're losing the information

869
00:38:34,627 --> 00:38:35,827
that you really need to have.

870
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,863
So eventually we dialed it back and we settled on,

871
00:38:40,304 --> 00:38:43,346
we're gonna let the drifter give you some really flavorful

872
00:38:43,506 --> 00:38:45,388
intros and outros to the mode.

873
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,689
When you start and when you end,

874
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,511
he's gonna really set the tone.

875
00:38:49,532 --> 00:38:51,053
And then in the heat of the match,

876
00:38:51,173 --> 00:38:55,017
he's going to comment on the essential gameplay moments.

877
00:38:55,057 --> 00:38:57,919
These are things like invasions, the primeval being up.

878
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,402
And then occasional color commentary

879
00:39:00,442 --> 00:39:02,824
when you as a player do something dramatic.

880
00:39:04,687 --> 00:39:07,391
One of the last additions that we added was reporting back

881
00:39:07,952 --> 00:39:09,073
on what the invader did.

882
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,416
For a while, the invader would go over

883
00:39:11,497 --> 00:39:12,818
and they would have their invasion.

884
00:39:13,797 --> 00:39:16,537
and then just pop back into your arena and that was it.

885
00:39:16,737 --> 00:39:19,558
And you as the invader know what you did.

886
00:39:19,618 --> 00:39:21,138
You know that you got an army of one.

887
00:39:21,218 --> 00:39:23,579
You know that you killed all four members of the enemy team,

888
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:25,499
but your team didn't know that.

889
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,960
And so it felt like your accomplishment as an invader

890
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,581
wasn't being adequately communicated to your team

891
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:34,641
so that they knew that you were contributing.

892
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:37,522
When we had the drifter comment on that,

893
00:39:37,962 --> 00:39:39,222
hey, your invader is back,

894
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:41,283
and they took three guys with them, right?

895
00:39:41,583 --> 00:39:43,443
Whatever that kind of line that he says.

896
00:39:44,284 --> 00:39:45,905
that really closed the feedback loop

897
00:39:46,566 --> 00:39:47,807
and it brought it all together.

898
00:39:48,127 --> 00:39:50,048
And that helped us address that question

899
00:39:50,109 --> 00:39:51,850
from way back in the beginning of the talk about,

900
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,672
hey, if I don't see the other team, why do I care?

901
00:39:54,932 --> 00:39:56,794
Like, knowing what the invader did

902
00:39:56,854 --> 00:39:58,495
while he's over on the other side

903
00:39:59,716 --> 00:40:01,898
made a very strong impact on the feel of the mode.

904
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,101
Players are often confused about

905
00:40:06,181 --> 00:40:07,803
where and when new waves spawned,

906
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:09,604
and so they would waste a lot of time

907
00:40:09,864 --> 00:40:12,206
just searching the map, trying to find something to kill.

908
00:40:13,189 --> 00:40:15,810
So having the drifter call out the name of the incoming front

909
00:40:16,351 --> 00:40:17,891
immediately helped with that problem.

910
00:40:19,172 --> 00:40:21,593
Each map has three named fronts.

911
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:26,595
And we could have called them A, B, and C, or North, South,

912
00:40:26,655 --> 00:40:28,476
and West, or something else generic.

913
00:40:28,856 --> 00:40:32,018
But we felt pretty strongly that tying them

914
00:40:32,178 --> 00:40:33,438
to each individual map.

915
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,201
increased the immersion in the space,

916
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:38,823
and was unique for the mode,

917
00:40:38,863 --> 00:40:40,324
and just enriched the experience.

918
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:42,646
But it had the cost that we were committing to

919
00:40:42,806 --> 00:40:45,068
that meant that any time we create a new map,

920
00:40:45,088 --> 00:40:48,011
we're gonna have to pull our voice actor, Todd Haberkorn,

921
00:40:48,331 --> 00:40:51,074
back into the booth to record the new call-outs

922
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:51,754
for the new maps.

923
00:40:52,745 --> 00:40:53,786
We gave ourself a backdoor.

924
00:40:54,626 --> 00:40:57,167
We do have him saying A, B, and C.

925
00:40:57,587 --> 00:40:59,948
We do have him saying North, South, East, and West.

926
00:41:00,328 --> 00:41:02,869
So that if we ever release a map and can't get him back in,

927
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:04,889
we have that option available to us.

928
00:41:05,389 --> 00:41:06,790
Hopefully, we'll never have to use it.

929
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:10,171
But the realities of production means maybe for some reason

930
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:11,351
our schedules won't align.

931
00:41:11,371 --> 00:41:13,432
So we made sure to give us the backdoor in case we need it.

932
00:41:13,812 --> 00:41:15,873
But so far, we've been able to go back for every map.

933
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:22,744
The primeval heal is a vital mechanic

934
00:41:22,844 --> 00:41:26,125
that came late in development when we had very limited ability

935
00:41:26,305 --> 00:41:28,225
to give bespoke feedback.

936
00:41:28,265 --> 00:41:30,026
And so we were actually kind of worried

937
00:41:30,466 --> 00:41:32,166
that players weren't going to understand it.

938
00:41:32,227 --> 00:41:34,447
They weren't going to get, like, why is this thing healing?

939
00:41:34,507 --> 00:41:35,207
I don't understand.

940
00:41:35,247 --> 00:41:36,148
I don't know what's happening.

941
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:38,488
There are effects on the primeval,

942
00:41:38,508 --> 00:41:39,649
but they're difficult to see.

943
00:41:40,189 --> 00:41:43,710
And aside from a brief tutorial, little box of text

944
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:45,411
that pops up on the screen, nothing

945
00:41:45,471 --> 00:41:48,271
tells you that killing guardians will heal the primeval.

946
00:41:48,371 --> 00:41:48,491
So.

947
00:41:50,143 --> 00:41:54,086
We address this with two things, a very distinctive sound effect

948
00:41:54,126 --> 00:41:56,368
that you hear at no other time during the game.

949
00:41:56,388 --> 00:42:00,411
When you hear that long sound during that mode,

950
00:42:00,631 --> 00:42:02,792
you know that one of your teammates has bit the dust.

951
00:42:03,953 --> 00:42:07,195
And when that happens, Death Heals Primeval

952
00:42:08,236 --> 00:42:09,537
plays on the top of your screen.

953
00:42:09,557 --> 00:42:10,858
Like in the center of your screen,

954
00:42:11,638 --> 00:42:12,999
those words pop up in red.

955
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,282
It was crude, but really effective.

956
00:42:18,122 --> 00:42:20,964
And it wound up generating a meme, which generated a shirt,

957
00:42:21,224 --> 00:42:23,325
which is sold out multiple times in the Bungie store.

958
00:42:24,305 --> 00:42:29,108
So it's interesting how sometimes necessity breeds

959
00:42:29,168 --> 00:42:30,669
invention in cases like this.

960
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,910
And we made something out of basically nothing.

961
00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:38,530
Even though the language of our game

962
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,751
went through a lot of iteration,

963
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,513
for a while we went too far into the taken direction

964
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:45,054
by having players bury moats in the crypt,

965
00:42:45,495 --> 00:42:48,317
and that terminology never really gelled with the team.

966
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:52,599
So we went back to depositing moats in the bank,

967
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:54,781
which were terms that players already understood,

968
00:42:54,821 --> 00:42:56,642
and so they did a lot of the heavy lifting for us.

969
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:59,184
Why invent a whole new set of terms

970
00:42:59,604 --> 00:43:02,286
when we can, in a mode that's already complex

971
00:43:02,326 --> 00:43:03,767
and has you needing to learn a lot,

972
00:43:04,447 --> 00:43:05,628
anything that we're able to leverage

973
00:43:06,769 --> 00:43:10,053
modalities that you already understand and interactions that you understand

974
00:43:10,393 --> 00:43:13,116
just help jump into the mode much more quickly.

975
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,143
So, we've come to the inevitable pivot.

976
00:43:21,205 --> 00:43:23,546
I'm sure many of you have worked on projects

977
00:43:23,606 --> 00:43:25,307
where you get to a point where you're really happy

978
00:43:25,327 --> 00:43:26,287
with the way things are going,

979
00:43:26,307 --> 00:43:28,748
and then you kind of get Gary Cole from Office Space

980
00:43:28,828 --> 00:43:29,828
walking down and saying,

981
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:37,992
yeah, I'm gonna need you to do this other thing over here.

982
00:43:38,092 --> 00:43:40,693
You know that cart racer that you're doing?

983
00:43:41,713 --> 00:43:42,894
We need them to have guns.

984
00:43:43,254 --> 00:43:46,495
Yeah, you need to be able to destroy the other racers.

985
00:43:47,396 --> 00:43:48,736
Something, a major shift.

986
00:43:49,757 --> 00:43:50,737
That never happened to us.

987
00:43:51,377 --> 00:43:53,478
We were very, very fortunate that we had buy-in

988
00:43:53,538 --> 00:43:55,599
from our management throughout the process.

989
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,039
They were playing it along with us.

990
00:43:57,099 --> 00:43:58,360
They believed in what we were doing.

991
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,261
And they never directed us to change the gameplay in any way.

992
00:44:02,201 --> 00:44:04,182
But what they did say was that.

993
00:44:05,326 --> 00:44:08,067
was that Gambit was too much fun to restrict

994
00:44:08,107 --> 00:44:10,968
to pre-formed fire teams as we were originally planning.

995
00:44:11,429 --> 00:44:14,570
It was gonna be an equivalent of Trials of the Nine,

996
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:17,651
which you could only play with your friends,

997
00:44:17,711 --> 00:44:19,752
with a team that you pre-form.

998
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,253
You weren't gonna get match-made.

999
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:24,774
And so the thinking was, this game really wants

1000
00:44:24,794 --> 00:44:25,835
to get in front of more people,

1001
00:44:25,855 --> 00:44:27,856
and the way to do that is to allow you to match-make.

1002
00:44:28,775 --> 00:44:32,040
So the mode changed from being an end game ritual

1003
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,163
that you would return to every week

1004
00:44:34,723 --> 00:44:37,548
to being an always available playlist for match made teams.

1005
00:44:37,648 --> 00:44:40,552
And in practice, this didn't really affect us

1006
00:44:40,872 --> 00:44:42,775
as a development team very much.

1007
00:44:43,855 --> 00:44:44,756
We knocked the game down.

1008
00:44:44,796 --> 00:44:47,259
Originally, it was going to be best three out of five,

1009
00:44:48,281 --> 00:44:51,405
which felt right for an end game competitive activity.

1010
00:44:51,705 --> 00:44:53,748
But for match made, we felt that was a little bit too much.

1011
00:44:53,788 --> 00:44:55,310
So we dropped it down to two out of three

1012
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:58,254
to make it more casual friendly, but keeping multiple rounds

1013
00:44:58,274 --> 00:44:59,675
so you could still have those comebacks.

1014
00:45:00,628 --> 00:45:04,571
We tabled any ideas that we had about emphasizing team

1015
00:45:04,631 --> 00:45:06,312
communication and cooperation.

1016
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,914
We didn't want to introduce any new mechanics that

1017
00:45:08,974 --> 00:45:11,395
would require pre-made fire teams, effectively.

1018
00:45:12,036 --> 00:45:14,357
And we went with a simpler investment plan,

1019
00:45:14,397 --> 00:45:16,179
the infamy ranking system that we have,

1020
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:18,720
rather than a more complex plan that we

1021
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,941
might have gone with otherwise.

1022
00:45:21,542 --> 00:45:22,242
So let's go back here.

1023
00:45:23,323 --> 00:45:25,905
Now that we're getting down near the end of our development,

1024
00:45:25,945 --> 00:45:27,866
looking back at our pillars, we had already

1025
00:45:27,946 --> 00:45:30,388
killed that no direct player interaction pillar.

1026
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:34,843
And this pivot killed the pre-planning is essential,

1027
00:45:35,423 --> 00:45:37,643
because we wanted people to just match make with whoever

1028
00:45:37,703 --> 00:45:40,544
and be able to play, and we killed the new weekly ritual.

1029
00:45:40,744 --> 00:45:42,905
That was no longer deemed to be important.

1030
00:45:42,925 --> 00:45:45,006
It was more important to get more people into the game.

1031
00:45:47,826 --> 00:45:49,587
We started Gambit before D2 shipped.

1032
00:45:50,328 --> 00:45:52,229
And Crucible was going to be all 4v4.

1033
00:45:52,289 --> 00:45:54,449
But midway through, we reexamined that.

1034
00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:57,390
By making the technical choices that we had made,

1035
00:45:57,470 --> 00:46:00,731
we had already closed the door on Gambit being 6v6.

1036
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,471
Because both arenas were in one bubble,

1037
00:46:03,952 --> 00:46:05,992
if we tried to put six players in the arena,

1038
00:46:06,632 --> 00:46:08,233
we would have to increase the AI count

1039
00:46:08,353 --> 00:46:09,693
to keep your players busy.

1040
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:13,394
And plus, now you have six supers potentially in play

1041
00:46:13,414 --> 00:46:16,494
at once instead of four with all of their concurrent effects.

1042
00:46:16,534 --> 00:46:17,875
And it would have been too much.

1043
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:19,755
The perf costs wouldn't have allowed it.

1044
00:46:20,715 --> 00:46:25,776
So we asked ourselves about what if we went the other way and what if it was 3v3 and we tried it

1045
00:46:26,397 --> 00:46:28,377
But it really didn't work as well

1046
00:46:28,417 --> 00:46:33,718
It wasn't as much fun because invasions became less balanced now when you lose one person from your side

1047
00:46:33,758 --> 00:46:41,080
You're down to two and that really weakened the experience across the board it meant removing a player really meant removing a role

1048
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,941
Fewer players meant it was slower less exciting, and it just didn't feel as good so we stuck to our 4v4 guns

1049
00:46:51,346 --> 00:46:52,660
Takeaways about the process.

1050
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:56,600
Gambit was a fully funded, multi-discipline team

1051
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,501
where we had members of a lot of the shared disciplines

1052
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:03,561
at Bungie, things like sound, UX.

1053
00:47:03,982 --> 00:47:05,302
They were embedded in our team.

1054
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,063
And we had representatives from across the board

1055
00:47:08,163 --> 00:47:08,903
in our stand-ups.

1056
00:47:09,323 --> 00:47:11,984
And it really impacted the development of the mode.

1057
00:47:12,044 --> 00:47:13,064
It was very smooth.

1058
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:15,544
Everybody had buy-in and it was highly collaborative.

1059
00:47:16,065 --> 00:47:18,205
We had clear design goals and pillars

1060
00:47:18,345 --> 00:47:20,686
that our team and our leadership were aligned with.

1061
00:47:21,397 --> 00:47:22,197
And we had autonomy.

1062
00:47:23,138 --> 00:47:24,540
Only that pivot that I mentioned

1063
00:47:25,381 --> 00:47:27,623
were we redirected in any meaningful way.

1064
00:47:28,865 --> 00:47:31,808
Our leadership never stuck their fingers in that design pie.

1065
00:47:32,128 --> 00:47:34,531
They trusted us, they believed in what we were making.

1066
00:47:35,231 --> 00:47:38,074
And so Gambit's success stems from that trust

1067
00:47:38,115 --> 00:47:40,537
and giving the team the resources that it needed

1068
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,659
to design and execute something great.

1069
00:47:43,891 --> 00:47:45,513
People on the Gambit team, as a result,

1070
00:47:45,994 --> 00:47:48,496
have no horror stories about the development of that product.

1071
00:47:48,537 --> 00:47:51,140
And in fact, most people on that core team

1072
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,382
view it as one of the best experiences

1073
00:47:53,442 --> 00:47:54,524
of our professional lives.

1074
00:47:54,884 --> 00:47:57,307
It was satisfying and rewarding, and we

1075
00:47:57,347 --> 00:47:58,749
were bought into the process.

1076
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,612
It was just a terrific experience all the way around.

1077
00:48:03,165 --> 00:48:04,868
Ironically, we succeeded by failing.

1078
00:48:05,569 --> 00:48:09,534
We didn't find a way to make players care

1079
00:48:09,574 --> 00:48:12,538
about the other team without direct player interaction.

1080
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:14,541
And as it turned out, direct player interaction

1081
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,043
was the secret sauce.

1082
00:48:16,544 --> 00:48:19,969
That 1v4 dynamic really makes Gambit stand out.

1083
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:23,250
Simpler is often better.

1084
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:26,251
This is something we return to over and over and over again

1085
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,211
during Gambit production.

1086
00:48:27,611 --> 00:48:29,792
Not seeing the other team made things simpler.

1087
00:48:30,452 --> 00:48:33,994
The primeval mechanics of not having something alien

1088
00:48:34,034 --> 00:48:35,834
like blights and focusing on things

1089
00:48:35,854 --> 00:48:38,115
that players were already doing, killing AI.

1090
00:48:39,495 --> 00:48:42,896
Hiding the clock and the blockers from the moat bar.

1091
00:48:43,237 --> 00:48:45,897
Streamlining the moats so that you're not seeing a timer.

1092
00:48:46,618 --> 00:48:49,158
Player communication, making all of that simpler.

1093
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:53,487
Creating hero moments is one of the things

1094
00:48:53,507 --> 00:48:55,488
that Gambit does really, really well.

1095
00:48:56,448 --> 00:48:59,469
In addition to invasion, there's also our high-value targets.

1096
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:02,810
These are big, beefy bad guys that come out

1097
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:05,291
over the course of the match, and if you kill them,

1098
00:49:05,571 --> 00:49:08,372
they shower a whole bunch of motes on the ground.

1099
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,633
And so it gives not only the PvP guys,

1100
00:49:11,873 --> 00:49:15,034
but the PvE players that moment to really shine

1101
00:49:15,154 --> 00:49:17,334
and take out a big, beefy bad guy

1102
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,895
and deliver motes to your team and be a rainmaker.

1103
00:49:21,629 --> 00:49:23,911
And the primeval coming together,

1104
00:49:24,231 --> 00:49:25,452
burning down that primeval,

1105
00:49:25,692 --> 00:49:27,894
your team as a whole feels like a hero.

1106
00:49:28,395 --> 00:49:29,716
So creating the hero moments, I think,

1107
00:49:29,756 --> 00:49:31,478
is one of the things that Gambit succeeded at.

1108
00:49:32,659 --> 00:49:36,362
And finally, players don't always know what they want.

1109
00:49:37,163 --> 00:49:40,886
Nobody was asking Bungie to make a PvEvP mode

1110
00:49:41,006 --> 00:49:43,268
that really wasn't on the radar, right?

1111
00:49:44,804 --> 00:49:46,385
Listening to players is valuable,

1112
00:49:46,505 --> 00:49:48,267
and you want to give players what they want.

1113
00:49:48,767 --> 00:49:51,931
But sometimes, it's even better to surprise and delight them

1114
00:49:52,051 --> 00:49:53,312
with something they didn't even know

1115
00:49:53,372 --> 00:49:54,613
that they wanted in the first place.

1116
00:49:56,835 --> 00:49:57,596
So, thank you.

1117
00:50:07,066 --> 00:50:09,788
And if anybody has questions, I'm happy to address them.

1118
00:50:19,026 --> 00:50:19,146
Hi.

1119
00:50:19,406 --> 00:50:19,546
Hi.

1120
00:50:20,246 --> 00:50:22,027
So you mentioned that this was originally

1121
00:50:22,067 --> 00:50:25,728
intended to be a weekly end game activity rather

1122
00:50:25,768 --> 00:50:28,508
than the strike playlist or the crucible playlist, right?

1123
00:50:28,768 --> 00:50:28,948
Yes.

1124
00:50:29,589 --> 00:50:33,289
So considering how those works in terms of rewards,

1125
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:36,550
they usually give you powerful rewards once a week.

1126
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,171
Was there a reward structure in place

1127
00:50:38,991 --> 00:50:41,271
for Gambit that was different from the one that is there now

1128
00:50:41,351 --> 00:50:42,672
before you made that change?

1129
00:50:43,952 --> 00:50:44,712
Or did that come later?

1130
00:50:44,952 --> 00:50:46,013
That actually came later.

1131
00:50:46,033 --> 00:50:48,373
So the question is about the reward structure for Gambit.

1132
00:50:48,573 --> 00:50:51,414
And were we giving a different set of rewards when it was

1133
00:50:51,454 --> 00:50:53,835
going to be an end game activity?

1134
00:50:54,235 --> 00:50:57,436
And while we had ideas on paper, nothing had been

1135
00:50:57,456 --> 00:50:58,076
decided yet.

1136
00:50:58,536 --> 00:51:02,378
So the investment portion, the reward portion, really came

1137
00:51:02,618 --> 00:51:04,258
after that decision to open it up to more

1138
00:51:04,298 --> 00:51:05,038
people had been made.

1139
00:51:05,379 --> 00:51:08,820
We were fortunate in that it took about, it was a 15 month

1140
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,800
development cycle, roughly, for Gambit.

1141
00:51:11,721 --> 00:51:13,103
starting with a core small team

1142
00:51:13,123 --> 00:51:14,324
and then getting bigger and bigger and bigger

1143
00:51:14,344 --> 00:51:15,405
as we got deeper into production.

1144
00:51:15,745 --> 00:51:18,368
And so we had a playable game fairly early.

1145
00:51:18,729 --> 00:51:20,511
The pivot didn't come all that late.

1146
00:51:20,631 --> 00:51:21,952
So we still had plenty of time

1147
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:24,675
after deciding to not make it be an end game ritual

1148
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:28,119
to respond to that and craft the reward system afterwards.

1149
00:51:29,261 --> 00:51:29,541
Thank you.

1150
00:51:29,861 --> 00:51:30,021
Sure.

1151
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,783
So I played quite a bit and there are a couple of mechanics you mentioned that was actually,

1152
00:51:35,803 --> 00:51:39,265
ooh, it works that way? You know, I gotta go back and try that, like dropping the three

1153
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:46,551
modes when you die. The bar for the 25 and 50 modes opens up the portal. I didn't know when

1154
00:51:46,571 --> 00:51:51,315
it opened up. So it got me thinking, there's a lot of new mechanics in this mode. Did the team

1155
00:51:51,355 --> 00:51:55,738
explore any other ways to try and communicate these nuances or do you prefer them to be

1156
00:51:55,758 --> 00:51:59,061
something that players discover, like, you know, loading screen tips or that kind of thing?

1157
00:51:59,161 --> 00:51:59,341
Right.

1158
00:52:00,142 --> 00:52:02,202
So the question is, hey, there are a bunch of mechanics

1159
00:52:02,682 --> 00:52:05,083
that are in the mode that maybe aren't as discoverable.

1160
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:06,843
Did you think about any other ways

1161
00:52:06,923 --> 00:52:08,204
to make them more discoverable?

1162
00:52:08,804 --> 00:52:11,024
And we would have loved to have given

1163
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:14,245
a more detailed introduction to the game.

1164
00:52:14,585 --> 00:52:16,006
There were a number of things that we explored

1165
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,306
from having a tutorial mission

1166
00:52:17,366 --> 00:52:19,447
where maybe you prepared a gambit arena

1167
00:52:20,687 --> 00:52:22,888
to having a video that you could play

1168
00:52:22,948 --> 00:52:24,228
that would walk you through the mode.

1169
00:52:24,268 --> 00:52:28,169
But for various reasons, time being a primary one,

1170
00:52:28,749 --> 00:52:30,029
a lot of those things didn't happen.

1171
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:31,590
And so in the course of production,

1172
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:33,850
you kind of have to choose where your battles are

1173
00:52:33,910 --> 00:52:35,291
and you've got five bucks to spend.

1174
00:52:35,351 --> 00:52:36,451
Where are you gonna spend those $5?

1175
00:52:37,351 --> 00:52:38,972
And we focused on the mode itself,

1176
00:52:39,512 --> 00:52:41,873
trusting that we know that the Destiny community,

1177
00:52:41,953 --> 00:52:43,893
there's a lot of information that you can get online

1178
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:45,334
about a lot of things about Destiny.

1179
00:52:45,374 --> 00:52:47,854
And so we just trusted that that information

1180
00:52:47,894 --> 00:52:49,515
would get out there one way or another.

1181
00:52:49,935 --> 00:52:50,995
And so we did the best we could

1182
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:52,555
with the resources that we had.

1183
00:52:53,016 --> 00:52:55,096
Yeah, it's totally playable without knowing those things.

1184
00:52:55,136 --> 00:52:55,936
So good job.

1185
00:52:56,376 --> 00:52:56,597
Thank you.

1186
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:05,419
Hi. You mentioned the group that came together to make Gambit was pretty complete and autonomous.

1187
00:53:05,439 --> 00:53:11,863
And I'm wondering, how did you go about crafting vision early and who was involved?

1188
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:12,764
Sure.

1189
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:18,771
Early on, we had designers and artists primarily in the mix.

1190
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:21,512
We also had an engineer and producers, of course.

1191
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:26,654
And the early design direction of the big pitch,

1192
00:53:26,794 --> 00:53:28,914
firefight meets super puzzle fighter,

1193
00:53:29,515 --> 00:53:32,315
that was kind of from the directors of Forsaken

1194
00:53:32,536 --> 00:53:34,276
and from our creative lead, Lars.

1195
00:53:36,459 --> 00:53:38,760
And once we had that as the foundation,

1196
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:42,222
then we had that core group of four or five people

1197
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,622
who were on board from the beginning.

1198
00:53:43,682 --> 00:53:46,004
And how were they decided, what disciplines and who?

1199
00:53:46,704 --> 00:53:48,425
It was kind of who was available at that time,

1200
00:53:48,485 --> 00:53:50,285
because you have to remember that D2

1201
00:53:50,646 --> 00:53:51,646
was still under production.

1202
00:53:51,666 --> 00:53:52,847
And so there were a lot of people

1203
00:53:52,887 --> 00:53:53,967
who would come on board later

1204
00:53:53,987 --> 00:53:56,208
who simply were not available to be involved yet.

1205
00:53:56,929 --> 00:54:01,374
So it was a small, tight-knit group of design, art, and engineering,

1206
00:54:02,055 --> 00:54:05,138
and everybody had a pretty much equal say

1207
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,641
in all of the decisions that we were making at that point.

1208
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,764
And that really continued throughout the production.

1209
00:54:09,784 --> 00:54:12,447
I think if you were to ask people on the Gambit team,

1210
00:54:13,388 --> 00:54:18,111
they would all tell you that they felt personally invested in the game because of that.

1211
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:21,814
They didn't feel like they were executing someone else's vision.

1212
00:54:22,154 --> 00:54:24,956
It was our vision together. It was our game.

1213
00:54:25,056 --> 00:54:27,438
And I think that is a huge part of the success.

1214
00:54:27,478 --> 00:54:29,920
I think you can feel it in the way that the game turned out.

1215
00:54:33,701 --> 00:54:36,942
So feel free to ignore this one if it's out of the scope,

1216
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:39,783
but given the recent release of Gambit Prime,

1217
00:54:39,823 --> 00:54:42,885
would you describe Gambit Prime as currently

1218
00:54:43,005 --> 00:54:46,106
as sort of a more pure expression

1219
00:54:46,126 --> 00:54:47,827
of the original vision of Gambit?

1220
00:54:47,887 --> 00:54:49,708
Because several of the pillars that you noted

1221
00:54:49,728 --> 00:54:52,710
you had to strike off the list came back in full force

1222
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:56,832
in Prime, like team composition, roles, communication,

1223
00:54:56,852 --> 00:55:00,533
but it's still matchmaking.

1224
00:55:01,797 --> 00:55:05,664
Yes, so the question is about Gambit Prime, which is the new iteration on Gambit that

1225
00:55:05,684 --> 00:55:08,870
was just released that kind of leans really heavily into roles.

1226
00:55:09,631 --> 00:55:12,877
And I think the answer is that...

1227
00:55:14,112 --> 00:55:18,254
Gambit Prime, we looked at how are we going to evolve Gambit?

1228
00:55:18,274 --> 00:55:20,075
What do we want to change about Gambit?

1229
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:21,096
And there were a couple of things.

1230
00:55:21,156 --> 00:55:23,117
We often got people asking, hey, it'd be great

1231
00:55:23,157 --> 00:55:25,758
if as an invader I had something else that I could do, right?

1232
00:55:26,259 --> 00:55:28,680
And so that's kind of where the moat draining came from,

1233
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:29,401
in part.

1234
00:55:30,621 --> 00:55:35,424
And then the roles of Gambit evolved somewhat organically.

1235
00:55:36,165 --> 00:55:37,585
And we looked at that and realized

1236
00:55:37,605 --> 00:55:39,066
that we had something really great.

1237
00:55:39,146 --> 00:55:41,147
One of the success factors of Gambit was that

1238
00:55:41,928 --> 00:55:43,769
I could be the collector while you're the killer

1239
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:45,810
and you're doing this other, you're the invader

1240
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:47,411
and we could each have a role in the game.

1241
00:55:47,452 --> 00:55:50,413
And so we thought that is part of what makes Gambit special.

1242
00:55:50,854 --> 00:55:52,215
Let's really double down there.

1243
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:55,457
So it wasn't a conscious effort to say,

1244
00:55:55,497 --> 00:55:57,058
hey, let's go back to those original pillars

1245
00:55:57,138 --> 00:55:58,118
and bring it back to that.

1246
00:55:58,218 --> 00:56:01,401
It was more of what do we already have in the game

1247
00:56:01,821 --> 00:56:05,063
that we can really build upon and what's missing?

1248
00:56:05,603 --> 00:56:08,585
And look at that and make some adjustments accordingly.

1249
00:56:08,825 --> 00:56:09,606
And that's where that came from.

1250
00:56:11,407 --> 00:56:11,587
Thanks.

1251
00:56:13,922 --> 00:56:19,645
For the exotic quest for the hand cam level, was that part of the original Gambit development?

1252
00:56:19,745 --> 00:56:27,629
And if so or not, what were some of the challenges you guys faced for balancing the original

1253
00:56:27,669 --> 00:56:31,751
Gambit primeval phase versus the exotic quest phase?

1254
00:56:33,482 --> 00:56:35,563
big hurdles that you guys had to go through.

1255
00:56:36,024 --> 00:56:37,164
Which exotic quest are you talking about?

1256
00:56:37,184 --> 00:56:38,565
For the exotic hand cannon.

1257
00:56:39,346 --> 00:56:39,806
Malfeasance?

1258
00:56:39,986 --> 00:56:41,167
Yeah, Malfeasance, that's what it was, thank you.

1259
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:44,769
So Malfeasance, so the question is,

1260
00:56:44,789 --> 00:56:48,531
hey, in our game, you get given a quest

1261
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:51,993
to get a powerful item, which we call exotics in our game,

1262
00:56:52,013 --> 00:56:55,434
an exotic weapon, and one of them involves Gambit

1263
00:56:55,475 --> 00:56:57,256
pretty strongly, very closely tied

1264
00:56:57,296 --> 00:56:58,416
with our character, the Drifter.

1265
00:56:59,397 --> 00:57:01,098
So how did those things balance out?

1266
00:57:01,738 --> 00:57:06,602
And the quest team is actually separate from the activity team in this case.

1267
00:57:06,782 --> 00:57:12,066
So we were really focused on Gambit, on this team, on developing the Gambit mode.

1268
00:57:12,086 --> 00:57:15,028
And there are other people on the team who are looking at,

1269
00:57:15,128 --> 00:57:19,290
hey, how are we going to keep players occupied throughout the Destiny ecosystem?

1270
00:57:19,331 --> 00:57:21,332
And one of them is we're going to send them on this quest.

1271
00:57:21,852 --> 00:57:24,193
So we knew that Malfeasance was going to be tied to the Drifter.

1272
00:57:24,213 --> 00:57:25,734
We knew it was going to be related to Gambit.

1273
00:57:25,954 --> 00:57:28,095
But the actual mechanics of the quest itself

1274
00:57:28,536 --> 00:57:30,897
were not the focus of the Gambit team.

1275
00:57:31,217 --> 00:57:31,457
OK.

1276
00:57:31,957 --> 00:57:32,178
Thank you.

1277
00:57:35,841 --> 00:57:39,384
I found myself kind of smiling to myself when you were explaining the player messaging for

1278
00:57:39,404 --> 00:57:43,506
the invasions, how many layers there were particularly, and that kind of started making

1279
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:47,129
you think about your playtesting cadence and wondering if that was response to playtesting

1280
00:57:48,029 --> 00:57:51,592
because of the invasions announced, the Klaxon, the Red Fog, the HUD, etc.

1281
00:57:51,632 --> 00:57:52,913
It just sounded very familiar to me.

1282
00:57:53,013 --> 00:57:57,016
So I was wondering about your playtesting cadence and also kind of the percentage of

1283
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:59,017
internal versus external playtesting that you did.

1284
00:57:59,537 --> 00:57:59,818
on the mob.

1285
00:58:00,178 --> 00:58:00,398
Great.

1286
00:58:00,438 --> 00:58:02,820
So the question is about how often do we playtest,

1287
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,362
and what's the ratio of internal and external playtests?

1288
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:09,926
We, as a team, playtested with each other daily.

1289
00:58:11,147 --> 00:58:13,649
We played the game for an hour every day together.

1290
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:16,732
And unless the builds somehow weren't working out,

1291
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:17,532
sometimes that happens.

1292
00:58:18,533 --> 00:58:19,934
So we were playing it all the time.

1293
00:58:20,835 --> 00:58:22,596
And that gave us a really good pulse

1294
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,818
on where things were or weren't.

1295
00:58:25,899 --> 00:58:30,341
But we also had more late in the process,

1296
00:58:30,601 --> 00:58:34,122
we had some external testers and some user research going on,

1297
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:37,663
bringing some people in to see how new players were exposed

1298
00:58:37,683 --> 00:58:39,724
to it, both players who were new to Destiny

1299
00:58:39,784 --> 00:58:41,525
and players who were experienced in Destiny.

1300
00:58:41,585 --> 00:58:43,946
How did they differ in their reactions to the mode?

1301
00:58:43,986 --> 00:58:44,766
What did they understand?

1302
00:58:44,826 --> 00:58:45,766
What did they not understand?

1303
00:58:45,786 --> 00:58:48,487
And there were user surveys after one game,

1304
00:58:48,607 --> 00:58:50,748
after two games, after three and five.

1305
00:58:51,288 --> 00:58:54,029
What do you know about the mode now that you didn't know before?

1306
00:58:54,109 --> 00:58:54,929
And so that helped us.

1307
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:59,835
understand where our messaging was failing and where we needed to shore things up.

1308
00:59:00,335 --> 00:59:04,860
And we knew that invasion was just a critical mechanic to the game mode, and we had to make

1309
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:10,246
it very, very clear when that was happening because it felt, for a while, like before

1310
00:59:10,286 --> 00:59:12,889
all that feedback goes in, of course, you're just playing it on trust.

1311
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:15,371
You know that, oh yeah, later we're going to do stuff.

1312
00:59:15,391 --> 00:59:16,392
We're going to make this better.

1313
00:59:16,772 --> 00:59:18,314
But meanwhile, all we have is a little thing

1314
00:59:18,334 --> 00:59:20,215
at the bottom of the screen that says invader,

1315
00:59:20,595 --> 00:59:21,676
or whatever it might have been.

1316
00:59:21,776 --> 00:59:23,137
So it was really easy to miss.

1317
00:59:23,538 --> 00:59:25,759
And so we knew just from playing those early iterations

1318
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:27,000
that we need more here.

1319
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:29,883
And so as each layer kind of went in, it was like, yeah,

1320
00:59:29,903 --> 00:59:30,343
still need more.

1321
00:59:30,923 --> 00:59:31,464
Still need more.

1322
00:59:31,724 --> 00:59:33,485
And we kind of built it as we went.

1323
00:59:34,046 --> 00:59:34,326
Thank you.

1324
00:59:34,686 --> 00:59:34,846
Sure.

1325
00:59:36,505 --> 00:59:41,030
I was interested that with Gambit Prime you've now introduced health gating to the Primeval

1326
00:59:41,070 --> 00:59:44,793
bosses to stop people baking them like in a couple of seconds, really organised teams.

1327
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:49,818
But that's kind of led to like a different rhythm where you have usually now both teams

1328
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:53,301
tend to get the Primeval up and you have this kind of constant back and forth invasion.

1329
00:59:53,821 --> 00:59:58,686
How happy are you with that kind of cadence in Gambit Prime of the kind of final phase?

1330
01:00:00,012 --> 01:00:02,193
So the question is, the new version of Prime

1331
01:00:02,253 --> 01:00:04,434
has a different cadence than Gambit does,

1332
01:00:05,275 --> 01:00:06,775
and how do we feel about that cadence?

1333
01:00:07,436 --> 01:00:09,296
And we're always looking at it.

1334
01:00:10,297 --> 01:00:11,677
Think about Bungie, and this is one of the things

1335
01:00:11,697 --> 01:00:13,658
that impressed me when I was first joining the company,

1336
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:16,199
is how many people at Bungie play the game.

1337
01:00:16,997 --> 01:00:21,360
The philosophy at Bungie is that in live, we get no perks.

1338
01:00:22,001 --> 01:00:24,563
We have to play the game just like you guys do.

1339
01:00:25,143 --> 01:00:27,465
So I don't have a thousand voices.

1340
01:00:28,186 --> 01:00:29,907
I haven't earned that yet.

1341
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:31,188
There are things that I don't have.

1342
01:00:31,268 --> 01:00:32,649
I would love to be able to flip a switch

1343
01:00:32,689 --> 01:00:33,830
and just get a thousand voices.

1344
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:34,731
It doesn't work that way.

1345
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:36,152
Sure, at the office I can get it,

1346
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,174
but not on real live code.

1347
01:00:40,215 --> 01:00:45,916
We're constantly playing the game ourselves and feeling it and evaluating what we want

1348
01:00:45,956 --> 01:00:47,376
to change and what feels right.

1349
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:51,297
I think we like, there are a lot of things about Gambit Prime that we think work really

1350
01:00:51,317 --> 01:00:51,457
well.

1351
01:00:51,497 --> 01:00:56,078
We really like the fact that in one round it feels like lengthening the round and then

1352
01:00:56,138 --> 01:00:59,159
making it one round has just about the right length to it.

1353
01:01:00,899 --> 01:01:02,600
But there are things we might want to tweak.

1354
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,640
We're looking at things like, hey, is the primeval phase...

1355
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,141
versus the motes phase?

1356
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:09,522
Are they adequately balanced?

1357
01:01:09,963 --> 01:01:15,308
It seems a lot of the time like the invader and the defending

1358
01:01:15,348 --> 01:01:16,289
team are in sync.

1359
01:01:16,669 --> 01:01:18,230
So you'll get to that well of light

1360
01:01:18,491 --> 01:01:20,973
at the same time that the invader comes over and over

1361
01:01:21,033 --> 01:01:23,215
again by just you're in the right rhythm.

1362
01:01:23,515 --> 01:01:25,097
And so we're looking at maybe changing that up

1363
01:01:25,197 --> 01:01:26,798
so that there's a little more variety there.

1364
01:01:28,119 --> 01:01:30,481
Is the amount that the primeval is healed?

1365
01:01:32,136 --> 01:01:35,098
the is having to be the same amount in prime,

1366
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,560
the right decision as it is in gambit.

1367
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:40,002
There are a lot of things that we can tune

1368
01:01:40,322 --> 01:01:41,403
and we're looking at all of those things,

1369
01:01:41,483 --> 01:01:43,885
but so far, I mean, it's still so early

1370
01:01:44,405 --> 01:01:47,107
that we're kind of taking a cautious approach,

1371
01:01:47,768 --> 01:01:49,889
but the reaction so far seems to be really positive

1372
01:01:49,909 --> 01:01:51,791
to a lot of the changes, so we're feeling encouraged.

1373
01:01:52,071 --> 01:01:54,693
I got 21% delirium before coming to GDC

1374
01:01:54,713 --> 01:01:55,874
so I can help you with the.

1375
01:01:57,495 --> 01:01:58,676
See, I'm still working on that.

1376
01:01:58,816 --> 01:02:00,177
I want it badly, but I don't have it.

1377
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:00,617
It's a good gun.

1378
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:01,783
Yes.

1379
01:02:02,063 --> 01:02:03,925
How big was the original Gambit team?

1380
01:02:04,446 --> 01:02:05,567
And second question, why?

1381
01:02:05,827 --> 01:02:10,211
And at which stage you decided to use chess terminology

1382
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,813
to name this particular game mode?

1383
01:02:13,054 --> 01:02:13,854
What kind of technology?

1384
01:02:13,954 --> 01:02:14,235
Chess.

1385
01:02:14,435 --> 01:02:15,216
It's from chess.

1386
01:02:15,936 --> 01:02:17,398
Chess, the game of board?

1387
01:02:17,538 --> 01:02:17,718
Game?

1388
01:02:17,878 --> 01:02:18,719
Yeah?

1389
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,199
Oh.

1390
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,420
Yeah.

1391
01:02:20,641 --> 01:02:21,001
Why is it so?

1392
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:25,273
So I think the first part of your question was,

1393
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:26,113
how big was the team?

1394
01:02:26,293 --> 01:02:28,996
So initially there were, I think,

1395
01:02:29,096 --> 01:02:31,839
four or five of us on the team for the first couple of months.

1396
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:36,443
And that grew as more people became available

1397
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,925
and we could bring the resources on,

1398
01:02:37,985 --> 01:02:40,987
but also as we knew more about what we were making.

1399
01:02:41,488 --> 01:02:48,132
So originally it was very designer heavy, but also artists and engineering so that we understood what the repercussions of some of our decisions were.

1400
01:02:48,812 --> 01:02:54,155
And we had to develop the theory of what is a gambit map, the fact that it would always be three fronts.

1401
01:02:54,836 --> 01:03:02,981
We had a lot of different versions of what a gambit map would be, and we iterated on those concepts as well in the early process before we were really building anything.

1402
01:03:04,141 --> 01:03:08,404
So as resources and knowledge increased, the size of the team increased.

1403
01:03:09,916 --> 01:03:12,036
And I'm sorry, but I didn't quite understand

1404
01:03:12,076 --> 01:03:13,077
the second part of your question.

1405
01:03:13,657 --> 01:03:14,777
About the name of the game.

1406
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:15,717
Why is it called Gambit?

1407
01:03:15,757 --> 01:03:16,957
Oh, why is it called Gambit?

1408
01:03:17,237 --> 01:03:18,658
You know, that was originally just the code name.

1409
01:03:18,758 --> 01:03:20,958
It was code name Gambit before we even knew what it was.

1410
01:03:21,178 --> 01:03:24,059
It was like, okay, it's Firefight meets Puzzle Fighter,

1411
01:03:24,439 --> 01:03:25,539
and it's code name Gambit.

1412
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:28,719
And then, as so often happens in development,

1413
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,700
the code name is like, can we just ship it as Gambit?

1414
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:32,300
And it stuck.

1415
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:34,181
So we had it from the very beginning.

1416
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:35,661
There was no marketing invention.

1417
01:03:35,821 --> 01:03:36,781
No, it was actually, yeah.

1418
01:03:38,601 --> 01:03:39,582
Day one, it was Gambit.

1419
01:03:43,175 --> 01:03:44,716
I've got a couple of different questions.

1420
01:03:45,277 --> 01:03:50,543
The first one was, have you ever considered on the original gambit, where the invader,

1421
01:03:50,603 --> 01:03:55,429
when they go across, instead of dropping just three motes, that the motes would increase

1422
01:03:55,709 --> 01:03:57,611
as the player kills additional players?

1423
01:03:59,475 --> 01:04:01,336
Interesting idea, I don't think we did consider that.

1424
01:04:01,576 --> 01:04:04,558
Okay, the second question I had was on Gambit Prime,

1425
01:04:06,219 --> 01:04:07,520
was it ever considered the,

1426
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:10,002
instead of farming for three different armor tiers

1427
01:04:10,322 --> 01:04:14,064
in Reckoning, having the tiers unlock as you,

1428
01:04:14,525 --> 01:04:17,126
or a single piece of armor that would unlock

1429
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:19,528
the additional tiers as you completed those tiers?

1430
01:04:21,171 --> 01:04:28,736
So I was not directly involved with the investment loop for Prime and how we determined how those things worked.

1431
01:04:29,656 --> 01:04:41,664
So I can't speak to that, except to say that I know that that team looked at various past things that we have done, like Solstice Armor, and other ways that we have used armor in the past.

1432
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:46,206
We're always looking and trying new things, and so this was the solution that they landed on.

1433
01:04:47,127 --> 01:04:49,248
which I'm sure there might have been technical reasons

1434
01:04:49,448 --> 01:04:52,569
as well as design reasons for doing it the way that we did it.

1435
01:04:53,069 --> 01:04:55,170
Okay. The reason why I was asking was

1436
01:04:56,070 --> 01:04:58,151
some of the other people I play with and whatnot

1437
01:04:59,732 --> 01:05:03,113
feel as though now, since Tier 3 is out,

1438
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:07,755
trying to farm for Tier 1 and Tier 2 armor sets are kind of pointless.

1439
01:05:08,575 --> 01:05:11,076
That's true, and I think that was intentional in the loop,

1440
01:05:11,216 --> 01:05:13,097
that once Tier 3 becomes available,

1441
01:05:13,417 --> 01:05:15,017
people are going to be focused on Tier 3,

1442
01:05:15,137 --> 01:05:15,998
and we're okay with that.

1443
01:05:16,331 --> 01:05:17,332
Okay, thank you.

1444
01:05:18,853 --> 01:05:20,634
Hi there, huge fan of the game.

1445
01:05:21,114 --> 01:05:23,576
I just wanted to ask how you went about

1446
01:05:23,696 --> 01:05:25,037
collecting feedback for Gambit

1447
01:05:25,117 --> 01:05:27,219
and how you decided to act on it

1448
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:28,760
because you guys recently changed the blockers

1449
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:32,643
and from three rounds to two in a kind of a boss rush round.

1450
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:34,504
And then I also wanted to ask

1451
01:05:35,725 --> 01:05:37,746
if there was any significant feedback and changes

1452
01:05:38,086 --> 01:05:39,788
specifically due to the player summit

1453
01:05:39,808 --> 01:05:41,229
that you guys had about a year ago.

1454
01:05:43,546 --> 01:05:45,448
So the question is about feedback.

1455
01:05:45,508 --> 01:05:48,052
I assume you're talking about post-ship feedback, right?

1456
01:05:48,072 --> 01:05:49,093
Yes, that's the first question, yeah.

1457
01:05:49,273 --> 01:05:50,234
Yeah.

1458
01:05:50,835 --> 01:05:53,939
So like I said, we play the game ourselves in live.

1459
01:05:53,979 --> 01:05:55,762
And so we feel it the way that players do.

1460
01:05:56,422 --> 01:05:59,446
And some of us, like myself, have played a lot.

1461
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:03,409
And so we're pretty well aware of the issues

1462
01:06:03,649 --> 01:06:05,871
that are in the game and things that we might want to change.

1463
01:06:05,911 --> 01:06:07,671
We also have a community team that

1464
01:06:07,731 --> 01:06:10,753
is listening to our Bungie forums, to Reddit, to Twitter.

1465
01:06:11,193 --> 01:06:12,694
They're keeping their fingers on the pulse,

1466
01:06:12,794 --> 01:06:14,935
and they surface the issues that players

1467
01:06:14,955 --> 01:06:16,236
are having back to the team.

1468
01:06:16,536 --> 01:06:19,197
It's like, hey, these are the top n issues

1469
01:06:19,297 --> 01:06:21,018
that we're seeing people reporting.

1470
01:06:21,559 --> 01:06:23,860
And so we'll look at those issues and say, yeah, yeah.

1471
01:06:24,941 --> 01:06:26,083
Nope, not doing anything about that.

1472
01:06:26,283 --> 01:06:28,267
Like, technical reasons, we can't do anything there,

1473
01:06:28,367 --> 01:06:30,572
but ooh, yeah, we totally wanna do that too, right?

1474
01:06:31,012 --> 01:06:32,796
And so that helps inform our process.

1475
01:06:34,189 --> 01:06:35,830
And the other part of the question was,

1476
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:38,752
was there any big changes due to the player summit?

1477
01:06:38,772 --> 01:06:39,953
Oh, the player summit, right.

1478
01:06:40,573 --> 01:06:43,836
So actually, the player summit was incredibly positive

1479
01:06:43,896 --> 01:06:44,676
about Gambit.

1480
01:06:44,756 --> 01:06:48,119
When the community members played Gambit,

1481
01:06:48,219 --> 01:06:52,382
their first thing was, so we're getting this tomorrow, right?

1482
01:06:52,402 --> 01:06:54,043
Like, they didn't want to wait for it.

1483
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,564
So that was really gratifying.

1484
01:06:57,105 --> 01:06:58,566
There may have been some minor changes,

1485
01:06:58,606 --> 01:07:00,748
but I don't think there was anything really big that

1486
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,689
changed about Gambit as a result of that.

1487
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:04,111
Okay, great, thank you very much.

1488
01:07:06,633 --> 01:07:08,594
Thank you for the talk first, I think this will be quick.

1489
01:07:09,154 --> 01:07:11,776
So, as the game industry is kind of moving forward,

1490
01:07:11,816 --> 01:07:14,417
we're getting all these more niche kind of roles,

1491
01:07:14,657 --> 01:07:17,979
and I wanted to ask what a senior technical designer

1492
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:19,800
is exactly at Bungie.

1493
01:07:20,186 --> 01:07:22,387
So there's actually a talk tomorrow that someone is giving

1494
01:07:22,447 --> 01:07:25,349
about technical design, which I'm actually looking forward

1495
01:07:25,389 --> 01:07:27,250
to, because I'm interested in hearing about what technical

1496
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:28,430
design is in other places.

1497
01:07:29,811 --> 01:07:32,853
But at Bungie, a technical designer is a designer who can

1498
01:07:32,913 --> 01:07:35,854
do really technical things that other designers might not.

1499
01:07:35,954 --> 01:07:38,956
So in my case, I can write code, and not all designers

1500
01:07:39,016 --> 01:07:39,816
can write code.

1501
01:07:40,937 --> 01:07:46,039
So it's not necessarily about responsibility so much as it

1502
01:07:46,099 --> 01:07:47,400
is about skill set.

1503
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:50,581
and the fact that there are things

1504
01:07:50,661 --> 01:07:52,322
that I'm just capable of doing

1505
01:07:52,442 --> 01:07:55,303
that maybe someone else might not be capable of

1506
01:07:55,424 --> 01:07:56,524
without training, right?

1507
01:07:57,084 --> 01:07:57,424
That's all.

1508
01:07:57,825 --> 01:08:01,486
So I have the permissions to check code in,

1509
01:08:01,766 --> 01:08:03,987
whereas most designers do not have the permissions

1510
01:08:04,027 --> 01:08:05,368
to check code in, that kind of thing.

1511
01:08:06,088 --> 01:08:06,848
Cool, thank you.

1512
01:08:08,829 --> 01:08:09,370
A few things.

1513
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:12,411
First, can we get your voiceovers in Gamut

1514
01:08:12,591 --> 01:08:13,531
as a DLC, please?

1515
01:08:13,551 --> 01:08:14,672
Because that would be amazing.

1516
01:08:14,792 --> 01:08:16,373
The team has asked about that, too.

1517
01:08:17,561 --> 01:08:22,671
Yeah, though thankfully I don't have a SAG card, so we couldn't actually ship my voice.

1518
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:30,145
Okay, other thing, did you anticipate linear fusion rifles being so dominant in Gambit when you invade?

1519
01:08:31,135 --> 01:08:33,715
We did not.

1520
01:08:33,875 --> 01:08:37,076
We really expected that supers would be a lot more prevalent.

1521
01:08:37,916 --> 01:08:40,197
And especially roaming supers, we thought were going to be.

1522
01:08:40,577 --> 01:08:44,477
I think the bet was that Golden Gun was going

1523
01:08:44,497 --> 01:08:46,098
to be the thing to beat in Gambit.

1524
01:08:47,278 --> 01:08:48,758
And we knew about snipers.

1525
01:08:48,778 --> 01:08:50,279
We were certainly using a bunch of those.

1526
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:54,059
But the rise of linear fusion rifles in the Gambit meta

1527
01:08:54,099 --> 01:08:55,780
was definitely not expected.

1528
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,500
And part of that is because.

1529
01:08:58,695 --> 01:09:00,477
After one day of being out in the wild,

1530
01:09:00,677 --> 01:09:03,479
the game received way more playtesting,

1531
01:09:03,499 --> 01:09:05,742
like a gazillion times more playtesting

1532
01:09:05,782 --> 01:09:07,844
than it had received internally up until that point

1533
01:09:07,904 --> 01:09:09,545
because just math, right?

1534
01:09:09,785 --> 01:09:11,467
There's a limited number of people at Bungie

1535
01:09:11,607 --> 01:09:14,270
and there's like way more players out in the world.

1536
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:18,874
And so the meta evolved in a way that our small group didn't anticipate.

1537
01:09:18,934 --> 01:09:22,697
And that's just one of those things that you have to be prepared for and react to.

1538
01:09:22,777 --> 01:09:28,082
And so we tuned linear fusion rifles to kind of bring down their efficacy in

1539
01:09:28,102 --> 01:09:29,303
Gambit as a result of that.

1540
01:09:30,864 --> 01:09:35,628
And we're also aware of, for future map development,

1541
01:09:35,849 --> 01:09:38,111
maybe that will impact how we design maps so

1542
01:09:38,151 --> 01:09:41,794
that linear fusion rifles may not have as much of an impact in the future.

1543
01:09:42,154 --> 01:09:44,658
But, maybe. Or we might decide that we're going to lean into it.

1544
01:09:45,018 --> 01:09:46,340
We never know what we decide to do.

1545
01:09:47,181 --> 01:09:47,782
Awesome. Thank you.

1546
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:52,128
Alright, it looks like we're cutting things off.

1547
01:09:52,409 --> 01:09:53,590
So, thank you all for coming.

1548
01:09:53,691 --> 01:09:55,453
And if you have any more questions, just come find me.
