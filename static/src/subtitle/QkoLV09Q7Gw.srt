1
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,605
And I'll be speaking on crisis management in communities and my journey learning on how to handle crisis.

2
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:14,529
This is a deeper retrospective on the Kotaku and subsequently republished article,

3
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,773
What it's like to be the community manager for the worst PS4 game ever.

4
00:00:19,777 --> 00:00:23,178
Using my story, I'll be looking at both the professional and personal aspects.

5
00:00:23,838 --> 00:00:27,700
I'll be outlining some of the most important attributes of both areas I have found crucial,

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,441
and I'm going to tell you how I apply these to best interact with my communities.

7
00:00:32,681 --> 00:00:36,382
After professional, I'll be touching on the importance of transparency,

8
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:42,084
ownership of responsibility, use of empathy, clear communication and effective messaging.

9
00:00:43,104 --> 00:00:48,069
On the personal side, I'll be emphasising self-care, support networks, mental health,

10
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:50,791
knowing your limits and recovery after crisis.

11
00:00:53,914 --> 00:00:56,676
So previously I was a scientist, as you can see here.

12
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,579
That's actually me in an airlock exiting a negative pressure room.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,924
So my background is in science, genetics and microbiology to be exact, and I haven't had

14
00:01:05,964 --> 00:01:10,007
any previous training in PR, communications or community management.

15
00:01:10,027 --> 00:01:10,667
I am completely self-taught.

16
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:11,728
I am completely self-taught.

17
00:01:12,803 --> 00:01:14,564
Currently, I'm the Community Engagement Manager

18
00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:16,946
at EA Firemonkeys, based in Melbourne, Australia,

19
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:19,147
and I'm responsible for all live titles.

20
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:22,649
I'm also a relatively young upstart in the games industry,

21
00:01:22,669 --> 00:01:24,150
and I've only been around for a few years.

22
00:01:27,813 --> 00:01:29,434
So a question I get a lot is,

23
00:01:29,954 --> 00:01:31,255
how the hell did you end up in games?

24
00:01:33,856 --> 00:01:36,338
So I started in indie games on a project called Wanda.

25
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,520
There is where I learned my community management skills,

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,881
but also one crucial thing.

27
00:01:41,558 --> 00:01:42,319
crisis management.

28
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,962
I originally joined to help out a friend.

29
00:01:45,262 --> 00:01:46,323
I started off in QA

30
00:01:46,884 --> 00:01:48,866
and moved to community management at product launch,

31
00:01:49,266 --> 00:01:50,948
taking over all social media channels

32
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,570
without instructional mentoring.

33
00:01:53,972 --> 00:01:55,413
Despite not having guidance,

34
00:01:55,754 --> 00:01:57,436
my philosophy of approach at the time

35
00:01:57,476 --> 00:01:58,537
was that I would try to do

36
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:00,539
what I felt was in the best interest

37
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,341
for both the community and the development team.

38
00:02:03,566 --> 00:02:04,727
So just a little bit on Wanda.

39
00:02:05,948 --> 00:02:09,030
It was an exploration, narrative-focused, non-combat

40
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,470
MMO for PC and console.

41
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:12,192
Yes, I know, it's quite the mouthful.

42
00:02:13,352 --> 00:02:15,254
So it was in development for a number of years

43
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:17,255
with a very small team of less than 10 people

44
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:18,896
based in Melbourne, Australia.

45
00:02:21,578 --> 00:02:24,580
So before Wanda's launch, there was a lot of interest

46
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,681
from both domestic and international media,

47
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:29,403
as you can see here by some of these headlines and quotes.

48
00:02:30,223 --> 00:02:31,644
It was demoed at PAX Prime.

49
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,543
South, East, Australia, Gamescom, and even had an IndieGoGo Kickstarter.

50
00:02:38,164 --> 00:02:41,587
There was a lot of hype surrounding the game including press interest which commented on

51
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:47,811
the first impressions of the game itself. Breathtakingly beautiful, gorgeous, sheer

52
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:53,174
joy and mystery of exploration. These were some of the headlines and quotes from sites such as

53
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:59,478
Kotaku and Polygon. Wanda was definitely different in terms of gameplay style and visually on first

54
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:01,220
impressions it was indeed very pretty.

55
00:03:03,937 --> 00:03:06,059
However, Wanda was far from perfect.

56
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:10,563
This is an example of some of the problems that Wanda had.

57
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,548
It's what I affectionately call the slingshot effect.

58
00:03:16,389 --> 00:03:17,910
And I feel it actually speaks volumes

59
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,751
about the game itself.

60
00:03:21,393 --> 00:03:22,494
This is another example.

61
00:03:23,035 --> 00:03:24,316
So what you see here is a hearer,

62
00:03:24,676 --> 00:03:26,378
a humanoid form of the character you play,

63
00:03:26,818 --> 00:03:27,999
clipping straight through some rocks

64
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:29,881
and blatantly ignoring the collision volume.

65
00:03:31,265 --> 00:03:33,007
So Wanda had a bunch of live issues

66
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:35,389
such as constant crashing, progress loss,

67
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:37,250
as well as intrinsic game issues

68
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,372
such as clipping, janky animations,

69
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:41,694
as well as unfortunately clunky controls.

70
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:47,459
Unfortunately, Wanda failed to live up to expectation

71
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,539
and deliver at launch.

72
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:53,403
There was a significant element of media negativity,

73
00:03:53,684 --> 00:03:54,544
as you can see here,

74
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:57,867
on top of really quite negative player sentiment

75
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:58,507
and criticism.

76
00:03:59,676 --> 00:04:04,442
It was slammed by critics, in particular Jimquisition, who's known for his quite pointed view in games.

77
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,885
He was particularly harsh in Wanda.

78
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:08,947
How?

79
00:04:10,009 --> 00:04:13,413
How did this game trick the world into thinking it was something,

80
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:15,436
when it was absolutely nothing?

81
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,099
That was only the beginning of the storm.

82
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:25,517
In amongst the live issues we had, such as the progress loss and the crashing,

83
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:30,320
it was relatively common for players to state that Wanda was literally unplayable.

84
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,601
This is the review page for Wanda from Steam,

85
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:36,962
and this continues right down the page as far as you can read.

86
00:04:38,223 --> 00:04:40,864
It was at this time I took over the social media platforms,

87
00:04:41,164 --> 00:04:43,986
Facebook, Twitter, Steam Forums, Google+,

88
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:47,207
and I even started my own Twitch TV campaign stream.

89
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:51,359
This was my idea consisting of daily Q&As with the developers.

90
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:54,001
I played through the game, answered some questions,

91
00:04:54,101 --> 00:04:56,143
and fielded any feedback coming through.

92
00:04:57,424 --> 00:04:59,745
Sometimes these sessions lasted for more than four hours,

93
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:01,507
which is not bad for a first-time streamer.

94
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:04,389
But the net result seemed really positive,

95
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:07,431
as we didn't receive encouraging feedback and sentiment

96
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:09,232
from the community overall from me doing this.

97
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:14,757
These are just a small selection of some of the comments

98
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:15,917
we received about Wanda.

99
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:19,517
It was an avalanche with more coming in by the hour,

100
00:05:19,717 --> 00:05:21,679
on top of the negative press we were receiving.

101
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,162
In regards to some of the commentary we received,

102
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:28,364
we had unsavoury accusations of us trying to steal money

103
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:29,505
from the Australian government,

104
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,288
as Wanda had received funding for its development.

105
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:35,550
An interesting comment I'd like to point out here

106
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,391
is from Jennifer.

107
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:40,214
She says, a non-combative game made me rage quit.

108
00:05:40,855 --> 00:05:41,435
Which says it all.

109
00:05:42,932 --> 00:05:45,372
Behind the scenes, what people didn't know, though,

110
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:47,613
is that I wasn't just handling social media.

111
00:05:48,193 --> 00:05:50,614
But I was also trying to support our creative director

112
00:05:50,674 --> 00:05:53,695
and loan programmer as we worked through all the many days

113
00:05:53,735 --> 00:05:54,496
and nights together.

114
00:05:56,396 --> 00:05:59,297
I was burning myself out trying to support the game publicly

115
00:06:00,037 --> 00:06:00,678
and privately.

116
00:06:01,298 --> 00:06:03,299
That took a very heavy emotional toll on me.

117
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:07,860
On a few occasions, I had to simply walk away

118
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,161
from my laptop and just take a moment to breathe.

119
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,270
In the rare moments where that didn't work,

120
00:06:14,071 --> 00:06:14,951
I broke down in tears.

121
00:06:16,372 --> 00:06:17,993
So the shit really was on fire

122
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:22,655
with the emotional strain, stress, and ultimately tears.

123
00:06:26,957 --> 00:06:27,998
I was not fine.

124
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:32,960
So I'm gonna go through and give an outline

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,941
on how I break down messages from players

126
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:37,823
and their points in any engagement across platforms.

127
00:06:39,017 --> 00:06:44,720
I start by looking at key topics, friction points, tone of the message itself, points

128
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,523
where I can offer insight and information, as well as looking for opportunities to connect

129
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,423
and really engage.

130
00:06:51,804 --> 00:06:57,788
I'll also give my perspective on how I respond to communities whilst also doing what I can

131
00:06:57,948 --> 00:07:00,650
to turn an engagement into a positive interaction.

132
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,818
So this is a comment we received in our Facebook

133
00:07:05,838 --> 00:07:06,919
from a player named Darryl.

134
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:09,279
I'm not going to read all of it, so.

135
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,820
Any game may receive comments similar to this.

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,521
A lot more comments we did receive

137
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,661
were not nearly as well written or as reasonable as this.

138
00:07:19,302 --> 00:07:21,702
However, I'm going to use this as an example of how

139
00:07:21,782 --> 00:07:24,443
I approach answering player commentary

140
00:07:24,563 --> 00:07:26,103
using the professional skills I outlined

141
00:07:26,123 --> 00:07:27,183
at the beginning of my presentation.

142
00:07:30,162 --> 00:07:33,825
As I'm not going to have you read through Darryl's extensive comment, I'm going to break

143
00:07:33,845 --> 00:07:36,847
this down into the following key points which I've drawn from his comment.

144
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:40,831
So Darryl isn't attracted to the role-playing nature of Wanda.

145
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:43,473
The play style isn't quite his personal preference.

146
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:49,738
He describes Wanda as an empty sandbox with nothing to do, as well as states that he isn't

147
00:07:49,758 --> 00:07:52,280
trying to be mean in how he's conveying his experience.

148
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,600
He's bored yet holds out hope for something interesting eventually,

149
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,661
but ultimately right now there's not enough to hold his interest in the game.

150
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:06,462
He regrets buying the game and it not living up to his expectations and mentions attempting to

151
00:08:06,482 --> 00:08:11,403
get a refund from Sony. But the most interesting point I found out of this was at the very end,

152
00:08:11,963 --> 00:08:17,945
is that he expresses that he is apologetic for communicating his very negative experience.

153
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:22,765
This is my response to Dawa's comment,

154
00:08:22,905 --> 00:08:24,966
and it's almost equally as wordy.

155
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,027
So I'm definitely not going to make you read it all,

156
00:08:27,668 --> 00:08:28,989
but I will be breaking down my response

157
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:31,950
to show you how I approach responding to this.

158
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:35,953
In addressing the comments involving player feedback

159
00:08:36,013 --> 00:08:38,054
on your product, you need to keep in mind

160
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:39,375
some very important questions.

161
00:08:40,555 --> 00:08:42,957
Firstly, what were the specific issues raised?

162
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:45,878
Secondly, what are you going to do

163
00:08:45,898 --> 00:08:47,939
about addressing these problems?

164
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,120
Like, what do you need to do?

165
00:08:50,912 --> 00:08:55,296
I use these questions as a guide in writing my responses to comments, and I find them

166
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:57,297
generally useful in my everyday messaging.

167
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,903
A key point to remember is to communicate clearly your progress and process, such as

168
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:07,647
is there any news on terms of fixes, update ETAs, etc.

169
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:13,792
One of the things I did to help the community during my time at Wander is that I wrote FAQs

170
00:09:14,093 --> 00:09:17,616
and directed the community to them, which I did actually find quite helpful.

171
00:09:18,873 --> 00:09:20,854
Also when dealing with repetitive questions,

172
00:09:21,034 --> 00:09:22,835
I developed a template for responses

173
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:26,456
which became the foundation for a reactive messaging system,

174
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:29,417
an effective method I still use to this day.

175
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:31,798
On a personal level,

176
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:34,059
I was terrified I'd say something wrong.

177
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,660
As we all know, the internet never forgets.

178
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:47,439
In the first part of my response to Daryl, I try to empathize with him and try to build

179
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:50,380
a relationship by acknowledging and understanding his point of view.

180
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:56,222
Something to keep in mind is that individuals have approached you, opened up that dialogue

181
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:58,783
and taken the time and effort to write their comment.

182
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:02,264
They've ultimately come to you seeking for advice.

183
00:10:05,745 --> 00:10:09,986
In the second part of my comment, I go on to further acknowledge and address the issues

184
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:11,186
raised in his comment.

185
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:16,693
I also shed clarity on the situation as a whole and what our intentions and actions

186
00:10:16,773 --> 00:10:17,593
are moving forward.

187
00:10:18,854 --> 00:10:23,498
I go on to reassure him and acknowledge that his points are valid and that we will try

188
00:10:23,538 --> 00:10:24,619
to do something about them.

189
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,983
Overall, I try to be as transparent as possible in answering.

190
00:10:33,798 --> 00:10:35,880
In the last section of my reply to Daryl,

191
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,541
I approach problem solving by taking ownership

192
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:42,143
of the situation and giving an honest, clear answer

193
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,223
to the best of my ability.

194
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,165
I attempt to consolidate the relationship further

195
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:46,925
and build rapport.

196
00:10:47,686 --> 00:10:49,587
This is evidenced by my final statement,

197
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:50,467
take care of yourself.

198
00:10:51,447 --> 00:10:53,509
Connecting and showing an element of care

199
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:55,389
is humanizing your brand and product.

200
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,591
Part of community engagement is connecting

201
00:10:58,631 --> 00:11:00,592
with individuals and your community as a whole.

202
00:11:02,105 --> 00:11:06,671
By showing that you care, you are connecting with your community on a truly human level.

203
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,982
My entire experience wasn't completely bad. It's not all fire and brimstone, trust me.

204
00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:19,953
So there were some positive things that came out of Wanda,

205
00:11:20,174 --> 00:11:22,776
such as lasting friendships with developers,

206
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:24,838
both in Australia and externally.

207
00:11:25,578 --> 00:11:26,780
I also made friends with players.

208
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,023
So for example, I have two friends of mine in Seattle,

209
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:33,145
Penny and James, who I actually met through Wanda

210
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:34,146
because they were playing the game,

211
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:35,988
and I've kept in contact with them since.

212
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,611
So despite the negativity that we did receive,

213
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:41,673
we did have some positive feedback from players.

214
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,310
I also went through brand new experiences

215
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,891
and discovered a whole new set of skills

216
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:49,211
that I didn't know I previously had.

217
00:11:50,432 --> 00:11:51,992
But the one big thing is that I ended up

218
00:11:52,032 --> 00:11:52,833
in a career in games.

219
00:11:56,934 --> 00:11:58,715
When dealing with a crisis in your community,

220
00:11:58,775 --> 00:12:00,195
it's important to know your limits.

221
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:02,556
I worked beyond my limits,

222
00:12:02,936 --> 00:12:04,357
much to my own personal detriment.

223
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,222
So these are some tweets that I wrote from the Wanda account.

224
00:12:10,122 --> 00:12:12,644
I wrote these times where we went home.

225
00:12:13,004 --> 00:12:17,006
So as you note, 6.30 AM, 5.20 AM, 4.30 AM.

226
00:12:17,827 --> 00:12:19,167
The one good thing out of all of that

227
00:12:19,227 --> 00:12:21,929
is that we eventually got to go home at 4.30 AM

228
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,150
instead of 6.30 in the morning.

229
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,371
As you can see, I was working crazy hours

230
00:12:27,052 --> 00:12:28,633
to the point where my car got towed.

231
00:12:29,773 --> 00:12:33,275
I'd missed birthdays, dinners, brunches, coffee,

232
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,656
time with my friends and family.

233
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:40,272
I almost went completely broke to the point where I had $8 left in my bank account.

234
00:12:41,873 --> 00:12:45,016
I got sick to the point of being bedridden, yet I still continued to stream.

235
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,519
The community never sleeps, but you have to.

236
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,324
You are at the forefront and someone who can actively do something in the midst of a crisis.

237
00:12:56,446 --> 00:12:58,407
It's really important to take care of yourself.

238
00:12:58,507 --> 00:13:01,409
I can't stress this enough, as you will be tempted

239
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:03,310
to push yourself, but you have to be careful,

240
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:05,392
as the last thing you want to do is burn out.

241
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:10,975
So this is one of my favorite moments working

242
00:13:10,995 --> 00:13:11,656
on the project.

243
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:14,838
Pizza was ordered for us by some fans in Germany,

244
00:13:14,858 --> 00:13:16,879
and it arrived midway through my Twitch stream.

245
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:19,421
So if you actually go back and read the recorded streams,

246
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:20,821
there's one point where I go, pizza!

247
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:29,066
Um, so in the middle of a negativity storm, when just about anything can go

248
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:33,449
wrong and has gone wrong, when someone tweets your address, you kind of expect

249
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:35,791
a large angry mob to show up at your doorstep.

250
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:38,412
It's not a particularly rational thought.

251
00:13:38,813 --> 00:13:42,976
However, in a situation like that, it feels like just about anything is possible.

252
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:46,890
Despite the dark times, we had a support network,

253
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,011
which even included complete random strangers.

254
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:52,192
The community rallied around us,

255
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:54,053
both development and players alike.

256
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:56,694
It was then I began to take steps

257
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:57,814
to better look after myself,

258
00:13:57,874 --> 00:14:00,155
such as wrapping up my Twitch streams a bit earlier

259
00:14:00,175 --> 00:14:01,756
when I was sick or I needed rest,

260
00:14:02,556 --> 00:14:05,397
eating better and looking after myself

261
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:07,658
more than just eating pizza and takeaway.

262
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:16,562
I eventually left the project in August 2015 and began my own personal journey to recovery.

263
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:22,888
I spent a lot of time with friends going out and generally reacquainting myself with the

264
00:14:22,908 --> 00:14:23,168
world.

265
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:29,034
I took time to recover mentally and physically from working at Wanda and I had to teach myself,

266
00:14:29,294 --> 00:14:34,699
in a way, how to relax as I'd been under pressure for such an extended period of time where

267
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:35,940
this was all I really knew.

268
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,861
Both mental and physical health were things I had to work on,

269
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:45,362
that I had to put myself back in a good state.

270
00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:48,503
It took a while, and it was predominantly

271
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:50,443
my friends and family and a lot of sleep

272
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,764
that helped me get through that process

273
00:14:52,864 --> 00:14:55,825
to be back to normal and the person that I am today.

274
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,386
Since leaving the project, I have freelanced.

275
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:01,766
But during that time, I was deciding whether or not

276
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:04,527
I should go back to science, continue on to a medical degree,

277
00:15:04,787 --> 00:15:05,787
or stay in games.

278
00:15:07,201 --> 00:15:10,942
because I discovered that despite the interesting experience that I had

279
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:15,703
in the games industry, I'd really enjoyed the interactions and engagement with players.

280
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,823
I found something very deeply fulfilling in that.

281
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,544
Eventually, I applied for a job at EA and they took me on,

282
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:25,465
and they've taught me a heck of a lot since my time at Wanda.

283
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:29,405
I've really developed personally and professionally since then,

284
00:15:29,485 --> 00:15:31,966
and I've been exposed to new opportunities and challenges.

285
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:35,847
Ultimately, I'm really glad I made the career change and stayed in games.

286
00:15:39,446 --> 00:15:43,268
I've also got a whole new perspective on how games are made and promoted.

287
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:50,291
I've seen Wanda go from an idea, from coding, asset creation, animation, testing, to its

288
00:15:50,351 --> 00:15:51,452
release and aftermath.

289
00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:57,674
I have immense admiration for everyone who works in the games industry, but particularly

290
00:15:57,734 --> 00:16:01,256
community managers like yourselves, who are on the communication frontlines.

291
00:16:03,737 --> 00:16:08,960
So in summary, never underestimate the tremendous wrath of an immeasurable horde of irate gamers.

292
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:13,824
But at the same time, never underestimate your own strength

293
00:16:13,864 --> 00:16:14,884
in a dire situation.

294
00:16:16,064 --> 00:16:18,926
Stay calm, communicate with your community honestly,

295
00:16:19,306 --> 00:16:20,806
empathetically, and clearly.

296
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:23,568
Take responsibility where needed,

297
00:16:24,088 --> 00:16:26,849
and be proactive in your endeavors with engagement.

298
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:30,250
Ensure that you're taking care of your basic needs,

299
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,672
physically and psychologically, and rely on your support

300
00:16:33,712 --> 00:16:36,633
networks of friends, family, colleagues in the industry.

301
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:39,594
Other community managers have been a great help to me.

302
00:16:41,218 --> 00:16:43,960
Know that no matter how difficult the situation is,

303
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,541
you will weather the storm.

304
00:16:47,162 --> 00:16:50,104
But most importantly, for the sake of your health,

305
00:16:50,485 --> 00:16:52,066
well-being, and your product,

306
00:16:52,766 --> 00:16:54,508
take time and step away from the computer.

307
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,911
I'd like to share with you a particular gift

308
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,433
which I feel typifies the experience

309
00:17:01,473 --> 00:17:02,794
of community crisis management.

310
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:02,854
No.

311
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:06,216
No.

312
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:06,397
No.

313
00:17:06,477 --> 00:17:06,637
No.

314
00:17:07,738 --> 00:17:09,399
No.

315
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:09,739
Thank you.

316
00:17:17,618 --> 00:17:20,520
So there's a mic in the middle for anyone who would like to ask some questions.

317
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,635
Hey, how's it going?

318
00:17:38,696 --> 00:17:39,916
I'm a community manager and I've worked for

319
00:17:40,197 --> 00:17:42,318
a lot of big brands outside of gaming though.

320
00:17:42,498 --> 00:17:43,579
And when they have a crisis,

321
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,941
maybe it's because people in games, I don't know,

322
00:17:46,981 --> 00:17:48,822
maybe they feel like their money's already spent

323
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:49,763
and gone down the drain.

324
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,544
I know refunds are sort of a debate issue.

325
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:54,266
But I'm just wondering how you feel

326
00:17:54,326 --> 00:17:56,207
about people asking for refunds.

327
00:17:56,427 --> 00:17:58,949
And even though we can't always offer refunds,

328
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:00,310
is that something that you would ever use

329
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,411
to appease a community?

330
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:04,252
Or is that just like a dangerous can of worms

331
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,753
that you never ever want to crack open?

332
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:09,976
So the question is about refunds and how we sort of approach that.

333
00:18:11,338 --> 00:18:15,982
That's an interesting question and to an extent it depends upon your platform.

334
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:21,588
So a refunds policy may be different on Steam versus how it is in the App Store.

335
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:30,013
So what you can really do from your side is just refer them to the correct channels for the appropriate technical support.

336
00:18:31,634 --> 00:18:36,017
Usually with a lot of developers, they don't handle that transaction process.

337
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:38,599
It would still need to be gone through with the platforms.

338
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,721
But the best you can do to help them is redirect them through the appropriate support channels.

339
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,501
So in dealing with some of the different projects that you've worked on, especially having multiple

340
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:54,122
projects, from a community management perspective, how many people do you usually tie to any

341
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:57,964
one given project, especially if you have like a full spectrum support mechanism like

342
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,665
social media, forums, and so on and so forth?

343
00:19:01,635 --> 00:19:08,421
So the question is personnel per project and how the support goes with communications and that.

344
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,583
It really depends upon your project.

345
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:14,926
So I've had the privilege of being able to work on a tiny indie project,

346
00:19:15,527 --> 00:19:17,689
as well as something bigger such as EA,

347
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:23,574
where I've gone from a small community to, God, several million.

348
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:26,576
So it really depends.

349
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:29,199
It depends upon your staffing levels and also what your...

350
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:34,140
colleagues are willing to do what they feel like they can do in their power,

351
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,602
whether it's like answering the occasional tweet on Twitter and that,

352
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:40,724
that is still community management. You are speaking to a community and

353
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:46,128
individuals. So as to what might be an ideal scenario

354
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:49,731
for support for community management, it's hard to say. It really depends upon

355
00:19:50,411 --> 00:19:53,674
your own personal, your, sorry, your team's

356
00:19:54,714 --> 00:19:56,656
communities and situation at that point in time.

357
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:00,832
Thanks for the talk, that was great.

358
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:04,595
I really liked the way that you broke down Darrell's comment

359
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,837
and how you replied to him, addressing all of his points.

360
00:20:08,217 --> 00:20:11,080
I was just wondering, for say, the kind of like shorter,

361
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,962
meaner comments that you can get that are just kind of like,

362
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:17,424
this sucks and I hate it, did you bother replying to those

363
00:20:17,504 --> 00:20:18,785
and how did you go about responding

364
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:19,606
to those kind of people?

365
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:23,714
Yeah, so in regards to short comments like,

366
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,596
you suck, I hate your product and that,

367
00:20:25,776 --> 00:20:27,238
how do you go about interacting with that?

368
00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:30,881
You are within your rights to ignore

369
00:20:31,302 --> 00:20:34,605
very negative or toxic comments because,

370
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,808
for example on Facebook, if you answer a comment

371
00:20:37,868 --> 00:20:39,410
that will often float it up to the top

372
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,791
of the comment section.

373
00:20:42,512 --> 00:20:44,594
which may not be an ideal situation.

374
00:20:44,654 --> 00:20:45,695
I mean, it's great that you can,

375
00:20:46,235 --> 00:20:48,337
and one strategy I would employ is to turn

376
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:50,218
a negative situation to a positive.

377
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:52,940
So someone might be really pissed off

378
00:20:54,321 --> 00:20:55,762
in terms of something to do with your game,

379
00:20:56,263 --> 00:20:59,645
and you can be like, right, so what exactly is your issue?

380
00:20:59,765 --> 00:21:00,606
How can I help?

381
00:21:00,986 --> 00:21:02,587
Have you tried X, Y, and Z?

382
00:21:03,368 --> 00:21:06,510
So turn it into a positive interaction.

383
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:09,032
However, if it's just blatant abuse, then.

384
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,773
you're kind of better off not interacting with it to a certain extent.

385
00:21:13,793 --> 00:21:23,742
How are you able to gauge or measure the effects of your efforts on the community's

386
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:25,223
attitude toward the game?

387
00:21:26,257 --> 00:21:30,439
So how do you measure the effects of what you do on the community as a whole?

388
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,643
So there's a bunch of really great social listening suites out there.

389
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:42,106
That's really good in measuring the sentiment of your community as well as

390
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:44,288
measuring the effectiveness of your campaign.

391
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:47,550
So I definitely recommend looking into one of them.

392
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,052
But in terms of me starting out when I was, you know...

393
00:21:51,988 --> 00:21:54,409
without any mentoring, without any sort of instruction

394
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:55,990
on that sort of thing, I basically

395
00:21:56,591 --> 00:22:00,834
had to go through the responses by hand myself

396
00:22:00,954 --> 00:22:05,497
to really gauge if my actions were doing something

397
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,438
constructive and positive for the community.

398
00:22:07,518 --> 00:22:09,379
So you kind of got to do it by hand.

399
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:12,141
But if you have the means and the resources to,

400
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:15,943
I'd definitely have a look at social media listening suites,

401
00:22:16,484 --> 00:22:19,145
as they can often collate stuff into a report quite easily

402
00:22:19,225 --> 00:22:19,566
for you.

403
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:20,907
So that would be my suggestion.

404
00:22:23,518 --> 00:22:26,942
What made you stick with Wanda for as long as you did?

405
00:22:27,122 --> 00:22:29,825
Was it personal naughtiness with your friends?

406
00:22:30,406 --> 00:22:32,649
Belief in the game?

407
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:34,691
What made you stick around?

408
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:37,894
That's a very good question.

409
00:22:38,595 --> 00:22:39,656
What made me stick around?

410
00:22:39,676 --> 00:22:42,680
I'm stubborn as hell.

411
00:22:45,219 --> 00:22:48,504
But also, I believed in the philosophy of Wanda.

412
00:22:48,644 --> 00:22:52,710
It was an unpolished, untested, very different game.

413
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,873
It wasn't an Assassin's Creed or anything like that.

414
00:22:55,809 --> 00:23:00,050
But I believed in the philosophy and I still thought there was something there.

415
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:07,232
And the team members I worked with were very genuine, very passionate people who obviously

416
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:12,794
loved what they were doing. So in part I was inspired and motivated by them to stay around.

417
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,174
However, for the sake of my own well-being.

418
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:21,410
I had to eventually drop the project because it just wasn't viable for me to keep on living

419
00:23:22,051 --> 00:23:25,773
the way that I was doing. So in essence what kept me going

420
00:23:26,394 --> 00:23:30,697
is sheer force of will and also really a fantastic team and environment.

421
00:23:38,782 --> 00:23:43,205
I think that's everything. Has anyone got any more questions?

422
00:23:46,302 --> 00:23:48,447
All right, well thank you very much for coming to my talk.

423
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:51,434
And make sure you check out those surveys.
