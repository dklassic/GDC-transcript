1
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,731
Hi, good afternoon.

2
00:00:04,992 --> 00:00:05,772
Thank you all for coming.

3
00:00:06,233 --> 00:00:07,414
God, there's so many of you.

4
00:00:08,255 --> 00:00:10,898
I'm super excited to be here and even more terrified.

5
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:14,862
And I come here today to talk to you about quests,

6
00:00:15,322 --> 00:00:18,085
nonlinear narratives, and how we manage to put all of them

7
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:19,426
into Horizon Zero Dawn.

8
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:26,009
Now, for those of you who might not know, Horizon Zero Dawn is an open-world action role-playing game,

9
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:27,571
exclusive for the PlayStation 4.

10
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:31,016
It is set in a lush, post-post-apocalyptic world,

11
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:35,582
where gigantic machines have taken over and humanity is no longer the dominant species.

12
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:38,145
This talk will be composed of two parts.

13
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:41,647
First, I will delve into our research into quests,

14
00:00:41,947 --> 00:00:43,648
linear and non-linear narratives,

15
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,990
quest systems, quest building methods

16
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:47,931
in already existing games.

17
00:00:48,572 --> 00:00:50,513
In the second part, I will talk more about

18
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,975
how this research led us to the development

19
00:00:53,035 --> 00:00:56,097
of our own systems and methods and what exactly they are.

20
00:00:57,277 --> 00:00:59,538
Now, I know it might be a little bit unorthodox

21
00:00:59,598 --> 00:01:01,999
for an engineer to speak at this specific summit,

22
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,740
but I think there's a good enough reason for that.

23
00:01:05,121 --> 00:01:07,422
And first of all, although right now I'm employed

24
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:08,823
as a programmer at Guerrilla Games,

25
00:01:11,124 --> 00:01:12,665
my background is a little bit more diverse.

26
00:01:13,445 --> 00:01:15,026
I used to work in a mobile company

27
00:01:15,226 --> 00:01:17,627
where I had dual responsibilities as a designer,

28
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:20,589
where I also worked on narrative and quest systems.

29
00:01:20,889 --> 00:01:23,650
And before that, I had probably one of the best jobs possible

30
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,272
which was being a professional game or dungeon master.

31
00:01:28,807 --> 00:01:31,828
Secondly, I kind of hope that an engineer might bring

32
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:34,008
a little bit of a different perspective to the common

33
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:36,949
issues that we as game developers face regarding

34
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,511
building game narratives and narrative-based games.

35
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:45,972
And thirdly, quests are very interesting concepts

36
00:01:46,032 --> 00:01:49,154
in themselves, and by quests I'll be talking about

37
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:51,994
the things which you might find in role-playing games,

38
00:01:52,495 --> 00:01:54,615
not necessarily what you might encounter in literary

39
00:01:54,675 --> 00:01:57,816
studies, although these two tend to be closely related.

40
00:01:58,757 --> 00:02:00,217
Now, as some of you might be aware,

41
00:02:00,257 --> 00:02:01,578
there are two perspectives from which

42
00:02:01,658 --> 00:02:02,758
one can look at video games.

43
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:05,159
One is the narrative perspective,

44
00:02:05,339 --> 00:02:07,500
which understands a game as a form of a narrative.

45
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,141
Second is the ludic perspective, which understands the game

46
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,341
as a set of rules.

47
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,622
Now, Quest has been proposed as this way

48
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:17,263
to combine these two perspectives

49
00:02:17,343 --> 00:02:18,343
into a single concept.

50
00:02:18,803 --> 00:02:21,344
And that is partly because to exist, they need both.

51
00:02:22,104 --> 00:02:25,646
And I allow myself to quote Jeff Howard from his really cool

52
00:02:25,666 --> 00:02:27,886
book, Quest, which treats exactly about this topic.

53
00:02:28,827 --> 00:02:34,269
Quests are about action that is meaningful to a player on a level of ideas, personal ambitions,

54
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:40,052
benefit to society, and spiritual authenticity. And the word meaningful is exceptionally important

55
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:44,574
here because it also refers to the concept of meaningful choice, which is one of the most

56
00:02:44,674 --> 00:02:46,475
important ideas in good game design.

57
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:50,460
The meaning of quests emerges from strategic actions,

58
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:52,942
but these actions have thematic, narrative,

59
00:02:52,982 --> 00:02:54,102
and personal implications.

60
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,363
Through quests, the player interacts

61
00:02:56,403 --> 00:02:58,304
with both the rules and the narrative

62
00:02:58,644 --> 00:03:00,065
and draws meaning from both of them.

63
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:03,366
So to summarize all that, quests are this place

64
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:06,448
in a video game where game design, writing,

65
00:03:06,808 --> 00:03:08,408
and technology all come together.

66
00:03:11,282 --> 00:03:14,305
So to be able to discuss this topic,

67
00:03:14,645 --> 00:03:17,167
let's have a quick look at a structure of a typical quest.

68
00:03:17,988 --> 00:03:20,089
Quests are usually composed of multiple

69
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:21,610
discrete phases or steps.

70
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,333
Quests usually follow this typical structure

71
00:03:24,353 --> 00:03:27,195
of having an obvious start, obvious middle, and obvious end.

72
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:29,857
Each step of a quest can be considered

73
00:03:29,937 --> 00:03:32,479
a single piece of a greater quest narrative.

74
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,722
Often, a step is connected with a quest log entry,

75
00:03:36,043 --> 00:03:38,585
which informs the player about their progress so far,

76
00:03:38,945 --> 00:03:41,488
and forms also sort of a written narrative

77
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:44,791
of the player's personal progression through that quest.

78
00:03:45,812 --> 00:03:48,194
Also, a quest step can be connected to one

79
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:50,256
or multiple objectives which inform the player

80
00:03:50,337 --> 00:03:51,478
about the tasks at hand.

81
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:53,740
And usually, progressing through a quest

82
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,883
yields some sort of a reward which has a tangible value

83
00:03:56,943 --> 00:03:57,964
in the context of the game.

84
00:03:59,717 --> 00:04:02,480
So if we have a game which story is told mainly through quests,

85
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,404
we will need a system which will allow for creation and management of such quests.

86
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:10,509
And the shape of that system, its structure, how it functions,

87
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:12,551
and most importantly how we understand it,

88
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:16,235
has far-reaching implications into what kind of quests we can build,

89
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:18,678
and by turn, what kind of stories we can tell.

90
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,451
So as some of you might be aware,

91
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:24,092
guerrilla games used to specialize in first person

92
00:04:24,112 --> 00:04:25,713
shooters and action games in general.

93
00:04:26,173 --> 00:04:28,574
So when we set out to build Horizon,

94
00:04:28,594 --> 00:04:29,975
we had nothing of the sort.

95
00:04:30,835 --> 00:04:33,036
So in order to fill the gaps in our knowledge,

96
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:35,637
we decided to look at games that came before

97
00:04:36,157 --> 00:04:38,118
and also have a look at how other teams

98
00:04:38,318 --> 00:04:39,819
have approached this particular problem.

99
00:04:40,684 --> 00:04:44,509
And when looking during pre-production at various games,

100
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:47,933
we found multiple, multiple, very different approaches.

101
00:04:48,314 --> 00:04:51,939
But all of them had this common denominator.

102
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,662
And that was that all of them could have been placed.

103
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:58,339
on a scale which describes how flexible they are

104
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,862
and how strictly they define what the quest

105
00:05:01,223 --> 00:05:03,245
in the context of a particular game is.

106
00:05:04,006 --> 00:05:05,968
With systems that we could call relaxed

107
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:07,550
on one extreme of that scale

108
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,652
and systems that we could call strict

109
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:11,354
on the opposite extreme of that scale.

110
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:15,894
So what is a relaxed quest system?

111
00:05:16,394 --> 00:05:18,576
Well, at its extreme, it's a no system at all,

112
00:05:19,036 --> 00:05:21,718
meaning it has no centralized way of managing

113
00:05:21,778 --> 00:05:22,799
quests and their progression.

114
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:25,681
It even doesn't have a defined concept of a quest.

115
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:29,124
And any logic that exists to drive a gameplay forward

116
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:31,726
is implemented by the designers directly

117
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:33,827
into the scripting language of a game engine used.

118
00:05:34,808 --> 00:05:37,270
Because such an approach doesn't put any limitations on us,

119
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:40,133
in theory, any kind of story that can be expressed

120
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:41,234
through a quest is possible.

121
00:05:41,714 --> 00:05:45,597
However, this does come as a great cost of complexity

122
00:05:45,938 --> 00:05:47,319
and high time of implementation.

123
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,742
So, in theory, we could create intricate stories

124
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:53,644
which use sophisticated storytelling techniques,

125
00:05:54,044 --> 00:05:55,686
which do use complex structures,

126
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,587
but these kind of quests would be also

127
00:05:57,628 --> 00:05:58,748
very complicated to create.

128
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:03,610
However, these kind of systems have been used very successfully, especially in the early

129
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:05,911
days of computer role-playing game development.

130
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:08,952
So we're talking about games like Might and Magic or Wizardry.

131
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:14,494
But also recently, a lot of role-playing games built on top of RPG-making platform also use

132
00:06:14,514 --> 00:06:20,716
this method, partly because the RPG maker doesn't seem to support a system of its sort

133
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:21,356
out of the box.

134
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:25,360
So, on the opposite extreme of the scale,

135
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,741
we have a strict quest system,

136
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:29,564
and it's sort of a negative of a relaxed one,

137
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:33,007
meaning it does use a single centralized way

138
00:06:33,287 --> 00:06:35,229
of managing all quests and their progression,

139
00:06:35,609 --> 00:06:37,571
meaning each quest has a defined,

140
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:39,813
strictly defined, rigid structure.

141
00:06:41,304 --> 00:06:44,307
And any gameplay that exists in this game

142
00:06:44,507 --> 00:06:48,391
and is based upon quest is not scripted out by the designers,

143
00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:50,414
but built from predefined elements.

144
00:06:51,234 --> 00:06:53,797
And as you can imagine, such systems severely

145
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:55,499
limit what kind of quest can be created.

146
00:06:56,119 --> 00:07:00,421
However, it does have a positive impact on the complexity of implementation, time of

147
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:04,362
implementation, and actually also communication and cooperation between teams.

148
00:07:04,762 --> 00:07:09,944
Because everybody involved in building quests has the same idea of what a quest is, how

149
00:07:10,004 --> 00:07:11,645
it's structured, and how it should function.

150
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:17,927
And such systems have also been very successfully used, mostly though in hack and slash games,

151
00:07:17,987 --> 00:07:22,169
which are known for their mechanical depth rather than the narrative depth.

152
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:25,170
So we're talking about games like Titan Quest or Sacred.

153
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:29,455
Nowadays, it's actually quite rare to find a game which

154
00:07:29,555 --> 00:07:33,337
uses a system that exists on any extreme of that scale.

155
00:07:33,857 --> 00:07:36,619
And that is because our audiences over time

156
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,721
have started to demand more intricate stories and also

157
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:42,703
more sheer amount of content.

158
00:07:43,283 --> 00:07:47,365
So most teams are trying to find this middle ground,

159
00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:49,506
this middle of explore, this middle of the scale

160
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,628
to find this perfect balance between story complexity,

161
00:07:52,988 --> 00:07:55,890
freedom of expression, but also scalability and development

162
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,130
time.

163
00:07:57,462 --> 00:08:00,785
So if you were to put the games that we looked

164
00:08:00,925 --> 00:08:03,327
during pre-production of Horizon on a graph

165
00:08:03,407 --> 00:08:04,448
that represents that scale,

166
00:08:04,548 --> 00:08:05,669
it would look something like that.

167
00:08:06,189 --> 00:08:09,913
So on the right-hand extreme, on the relaxed side,

168
00:08:09,973 --> 00:08:11,134
we would have older RPGs,

169
00:08:11,454 --> 00:08:14,236
like Vampire of a Masquerade Redemption or Gothic,

170
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:16,818
and also RPG Maker-based games.

171
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,606
On the left-hand, stricter side, we would have games like Sacred or Titan Quest, the mentioned hack-and-slash games.

172
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:30,658
And somewhere in the middle, exploring this mentioned perfect balance, would be modern RPGs, like The Elder Scrolls V, Skyrim or The Witcher 2.

173
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:39,049
The other thing worth looking at is how do we actually merge rules with a narrative to create quests?

174
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:42,470
Well, there are actually two approaches, which seem kind of obvious.

175
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:49,373
First is to write a story, and then by injecting mechanics into it, and rules and challenges, add gameplay.

176
00:08:50,033 --> 00:08:55,755
Or the other way around, first to create these challenges, rules, and mechanics, and then wrap a story around them.

177
00:08:57,344 --> 00:08:59,765
Now, these two methods have been used pretty much ever

178
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:02,067
since we started building narrative-based games

179
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,249
and have been perfected over the years, tend to work well,

180
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:07,750
and have produced magnificent results.

181
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,172
However, because we are translating narrative

182
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:14,073
into logic or vice versa, sometimes cracks

183
00:09:14,193 --> 00:09:15,634
and inconsistencies can show.

184
00:09:16,314 --> 00:09:18,075
So regardless of our best efforts,

185
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:20,056
sometimes we might get a bit of a dissonance

186
00:09:20,096 --> 00:09:21,617
between the rules and the narrative.

187
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:25,458
So once we learned all that, we needed

188
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:27,340
to decide what our quest system would look like,

189
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,262
what kind of stories we would like to tell,

190
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:31,804
and what kind of tools we would need to be able to tell them.

191
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,668
So we came up with four high-level requirements

192
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:37,690
for our quest system and quest-building methods.

193
00:09:38,371 --> 00:09:40,933
So first of all, common types of quests

194
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:43,315
must be quick and easy to create.

195
00:09:44,076 --> 00:09:45,756
And I think that's very understandable.

196
00:09:45,856 --> 00:09:48,517
I mean, in any game, the content which is most common

197
00:09:48,897 --> 00:09:50,917
should be the quickest and easiest to create.

198
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:53,878
But in Horizon, it had an additional meaning.

199
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:57,239
Horizon Zero Dawn was supposed to be an open world game

200
00:09:57,299 --> 00:09:58,259
from the very start.

201
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:01,400
And open world games require a lot of content,

202
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,800
a lot of stories to create this feeling

203
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,140
of a living, breathing world.

204
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,881
Not necessarily complex ones, but still interesting.

205
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:12,288
Secondly, complex quests must not be complex

206
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:13,248
to create and manage.

207
00:10:13,908 --> 00:10:17,710
So although we were okay with having a lot

208
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,371
of relatively simple quests and relatively simple stories,

209
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:23,012
we still want to have this grand narrative,

210
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:26,413
these memorable stories, these quests which embed themselves

211
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:28,474
in the player's imagination and memory forever.

212
00:10:30,074 --> 00:10:32,435
So these two couldn't be in conflict.

213
00:10:32,755 --> 00:10:34,516
Our ability to create content quickly

214
00:10:34,756 --> 00:10:37,617
shouldn't hinder our ability to create intricate quests.

215
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,759
Thirdly, focus on non-linearity.

216
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,004
So again, Open Horizon was supposed

217
00:10:45,024 --> 00:10:46,745
to be an open world game from the very start.

218
00:10:47,186 --> 00:10:49,608
And open world games offer the players freedom,

219
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:53,352
of a player choice, and ability to approach any problem

220
00:10:53,392 --> 00:10:54,313
from multiple angles.

221
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:58,368
And we needed our stories to reinforce these roles,

222
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:00,349
to reinforce this feeling of freedom.

223
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,092
Therefore, we needed quests which are non-linear

224
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:03,712
at their base.

225
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:06,795
We needed quests that can be progressed by a player

226
00:11:06,895 --> 00:11:08,777
from multiple angles and in multiple ways.

227
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:12,280
We needed our system to have non-linearity

228
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,361
at its very core.

229
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,828
And fourthly, finally, provide a base common language

230
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,510
for both the rules and the narrative.

231
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,514
So this addresses the issue I mentioned earlier

232
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:24,376
of translating the rules into narrative

233
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:25,217
and narrative into rules.

234
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,782
And we didn't really set out to solve that particular issue,

235
00:11:28,902 --> 00:11:31,165
and I don't think it actually can be fully solved.

236
00:11:31,846 --> 00:11:35,373
but we at least wanted to make one step in the right direction

237
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:39,099
meaning we at least wanted to give the designers and the writers

238
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,386
this ability to have the same set of ideas and same set of concepts in their mind

239
00:11:43,687 --> 00:11:45,149
we're starting to build quests

240
00:11:47,272 --> 00:11:50,034
So after defining our requirements

241
00:11:50,154 --> 00:11:52,956
and after throwing some ideas on how we would approach

242
00:11:52,996 --> 00:11:56,098
this particular issue, we decided that our system

243
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:57,839
would live more on the stricter side

244
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,980
of that already mentioned scale.

245
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:01,241
And I think that makes sense.

246
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:02,962
Again, we need a lot of content,

247
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:06,124
and more rigid structures are good for quick development

248
00:12:06,285 --> 00:12:08,086
and really improve good communication

249
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,947
and cooperation between all teams.

250
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:13,749
So we knew what we wanted.

251
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,011
Now we needed to detail our approach.

252
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,821
We noticed that a lot of games, even the ones which do feature

253
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:26,743
magnificent non-linear narrative, still construct quests as sequences of steps.

254
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:31,245
So even though the player has the ability to deviate from the written story,

255
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,766
they are still faced with a linear script to follow.

256
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:36,167
And we wanted to approach it a little bit differently.

257
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:42,009
We wanted to present the player the probability space instead of a linear script to follow.

258
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:47,318
So we need a way to visualize our probability space.

259
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:49,441
We need a metaphor that will represent it.

260
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:52,687
And a probability space can be well represented as a graph.

261
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:57,034
So our first idea was to grab graph theory.

262
00:12:58,026 --> 00:12:59,527
So for those who might not know,

263
00:12:59,727 --> 00:13:01,948
graph theory is one of the fundamental branches

264
00:13:02,008 --> 00:13:04,149
of mathematics and studies the properties

265
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,411
of the formal structures that we call graphs.

266
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:09,012
These graphs are understood as networks

267
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:10,633
of points connected by lines.

268
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:13,935
So essentially graph theory is this formal study

269
00:13:13,955 --> 00:13:15,196
of connections between things.

270
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:20,086
However, that would be wonderful if our target audience

271
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,068
of these methods were mathematicians

272
00:13:22,128 --> 00:13:23,590
and artificial intelligence researchers.

273
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,532
But we needed the system to be usable,

274
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:28,214
easily understandable for people

275
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:30,956
who might not have this kind of technical knowledge.

276
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:33,819
So we need to look for our metaphor somewhere else.

277
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,501
So I went back.

278
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:40,023
in memory to the time where I still had this ambition to become a comic book author.

279
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:45,525
And I started trying to remember the techniques and methods of forging stories that I learned

280
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:51,507
back then. And I remembered something that I really liked, which I know as the wall of sticky notes.

281
00:13:53,288 --> 00:13:58,030
So what is a wall of sticky notes? Well, quite literally, it is a wall filled with sticky notes.

282
00:13:59,248 --> 00:14:04,751
But what is special about this method is that every sticky note represents a single plot

283
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:09,293
point, a single scene, depending on how granular you want to be in the plot you're trying to

284
00:14:09,353 --> 00:14:14,295
create, while the whole wall or the board that we are using is the story that you are

285
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:14,975
trying to write.

286
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,516
The other special thing about this method

287
00:14:17,617 --> 00:14:20,679
is that the lines that you see between these sticky notes

288
00:14:21,099 --> 00:14:24,901
represent the cause and effect relationships between events.

289
00:14:25,482 --> 00:14:27,903
That means that the event that is represented

290
00:14:27,983 --> 00:14:30,505
by the sticky note where the line starts

291
00:14:31,025 --> 00:14:33,547
is the cause of the event represented

292
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,348
by the sticky note where the line ends.

293
00:14:36,348 --> 00:14:37,109
A simple example.

294
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,351
Sticky note one, scene one.

295
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:42,952
The protagonist enters a village.

296
00:14:43,193 --> 00:14:46,215
A distressed villager approaches them and asks for help

297
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:50,317
for a horrible menace has entered their fields

298
00:14:50,377 --> 00:14:52,639
and started killing everyone, preventing them from working.

299
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,002
Scene one, post it one, the player enters the village

300
00:14:58,082 --> 00:14:58,903
and is asked for help.

301
00:15:00,664 --> 00:15:02,565
Scene two, sticky note two.

302
00:15:03,755 --> 00:15:06,997
The protagonist enters the fields, guns blazing,

303
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:08,558
killing everything that moves,

304
00:15:08,738 --> 00:15:10,719
clearing the whole field from the infestation.

305
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:15,902
Battle with the horrible, horrible insects.

306
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:18,104
Scene two, sticky notes two.

307
00:15:18,824 --> 00:15:20,345
Scene three, sticky note three.

308
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:23,127
The swarmed queen, upon realizing

309
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:24,607
that her minions were slain,

310
00:15:24,627 --> 00:15:27,829
awakens and engages the player in mortal combat.

311
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,291
However, our protagonist emerges victorious.

312
00:15:31,568 --> 00:15:34,931
the battle with the swan queen. Scene three, sticky note three.

313
00:15:35,371 --> 00:15:38,313
And our final scene, our final sticky note, the protagonist

314
00:15:38,353 --> 00:15:44,397
gloriously returns to the village and is given rewards in

315
00:15:44,437 --> 00:15:48,720
the form of bags of wheat or something like that. So,

316
00:15:49,718 --> 00:15:52,319
We have this very simple story, this chain of events,

317
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:56,160
one flowing from the other, connected by cause and effect.

318
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,801
And we created a chain, but as you can imagine,

319
00:15:59,821 --> 00:16:03,062
a single event doesn't need to cause a single other event.

320
00:16:03,482 --> 00:16:06,183
It is absolutely possible to be the cause of multiple.

321
00:16:06,563 --> 00:16:09,904
So we can create this sort of a web of cause and effect

322
00:16:09,944 --> 00:16:11,245
relationships between plot points.

323
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,007
So once we create this web of relationships,

324
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:16,548
we can start writing our story

325
00:16:16,969 --> 00:16:19,711
and start fleshing out our scenes.

326
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:21,572
So we can either go chronologically,

327
00:16:21,592 --> 00:16:23,614
or from start to finish,

328
00:16:23,814 --> 00:16:25,315
or we can scramble it about

329
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,816
and go all Quentin Tarantino on it.

330
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,331
But regardless of the methods that we use,

331
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:33,792
when the story is written, we have a very good idea

332
00:16:33,872 --> 00:16:36,853
of what event causes which, and it makes us less likely

333
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,213
to have logical plot holes.

334
00:16:38,854 --> 00:16:40,034
Well, I really like this method.

335
00:16:40,094 --> 00:16:41,575
I figured, hey, let's see what happens.

336
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:45,316
So how did we translate our wall of sticky notes

337
00:16:45,496 --> 00:16:47,277
into our quest building methods?

338
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:51,699
So we decided to represent a quest as a graph of steps.

339
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,380
Each step is a scene or a major event

340
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,281
in the greater plot of the quest.

341
00:16:58,081 --> 00:17:00,843
Initially, only start steps are available to the player.

342
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:03,145
But as the player progresses through a quest,

343
00:17:03,445 --> 00:17:05,167
meaning as the player completes the steps,

344
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:07,648
meaning as the player experiences the scenes

345
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,370
defined by the nodes of that graph,

346
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,732
different parts of the story open up before them or close.

347
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,835
And once the player reaches one of the end steps,

348
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,737
meaning experiences one of the end scenes,

349
00:17:19,057 --> 00:17:19,758
the quest will end.

350
00:17:21,732 --> 00:17:23,153
Now I'll show you a very simple example

351
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:24,434
of how that actually would work.

352
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:28,537
So the player starts their quest by talking to a villager

353
00:17:28,658 --> 00:17:29,558
and being asked for help.

354
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:33,321
Now, after that, the start part of that quest

355
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:34,523
is finished, completed, done.

356
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:37,705
However, two options open before the player.

357
00:17:38,346 --> 00:17:40,207
In the step A, in our scene A,

358
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:42,269
the player has the ability to go guns blazing

359
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:43,590
into the field and kill everything.

360
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,133
Or can instead try to approach the Swarm Queen

361
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:50,734
and maybe work out some sort of a solution.

362
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:54,897
Now, what is important here is that these two additional steps

363
00:17:55,778 --> 00:17:58,359
are possibilities that the player gets.

364
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,481
And also, as you can see, there are no lines between them.

365
00:18:01,782 --> 00:18:04,343
That means there is no relation between these two steps,

366
00:18:04,804 --> 00:18:07,125
meaning the player is absolutely allowed

367
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:09,587
to first talk with a Swarm Queen and then

368
00:18:09,647 --> 00:18:10,788
go into the field, kill stuff.

369
00:18:11,228 --> 00:18:15,330
or first go guns blazing and then decide to talk to the swarm queen

370
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,132
or can actually ignore any of these branches altogether.

371
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,914
However, if the player decides to be aggressive and kill all the insects

372
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:26,476
then the option of slaying the swarm queen opens up before them.

373
00:18:27,697 --> 00:18:31,279
And now, as you can see, there is a relation between talking with a swarm queen

374
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:32,700
and slaying the swarm queen.

375
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:37,772
That red line represents that if the player experiences

376
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:42,133
the scene in step B, the step C becomes impossible.

377
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:43,714
It is removed from the plot.

378
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:45,414
It is no longer accessible.

379
00:18:46,414 --> 00:18:48,675
That, but, what is important,

380
00:18:48,715 --> 00:18:50,015
there's no line in the other direction.

381
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,876
So the player is still able to talk with the Swarm Queen

382
00:18:52,936 --> 00:18:54,257
and then be a douche and kill her.

383
00:18:56,873 --> 00:18:58,414
But regardless of what they decide,

384
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:00,575
slaying her or talking with her,

385
00:19:00,595 --> 00:19:03,236
the option to end the quest opens up before them.

386
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:06,057
So by traveling through this quest graph,

387
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:09,879
the player has multiple ways to progress through a quest,

388
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,221
and in turn, multiple personal narratives are possible.

389
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:15,642
And all of these possibilities are created

390
00:19:15,782 --> 00:19:18,484
just by defining the cause and effect relationships

391
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:19,104
between scenes.

392
00:19:20,788 --> 00:19:26,292
So the way this would work in practice is that the writer would imagine this web of possible events

393
00:19:26,573 --> 00:19:32,377
where each event unlocks other possible events, in consequence, creating our probability space, the Kreutz graph.

394
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:36,320
The designer would have the same graph in their head,

395
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:41,344
however the nodes of that graph would have a very different context, a more rules-focused context.

396
00:19:41,905 --> 00:19:44,189
But because the initial step would be the same,

397
00:19:44,469 --> 00:19:46,213
meaning both the writer and the designer

398
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:49,478
would start with the graph and build on top of it,

399
00:19:49,779 --> 00:19:51,241
there would be less translation needed

400
00:19:51,281 --> 00:19:52,644
between the roles and the narrative.

401
00:19:54,335 --> 00:19:57,278
So now we have a graph, our grand story structure,

402
00:19:57,338 --> 00:19:58,839
but how does the player progress it?

403
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:02,601
So each step is understood as a scene,

404
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:05,664
and that scene must have a major verb

405
00:20:05,944 --> 00:20:09,126
which defines what action the player needs to perform

406
00:20:09,186 --> 00:20:10,127
in order to progress.

407
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:13,269
And sometimes we also define a target of that action.

408
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:17,132
So the player can obtain an item,

409
00:20:17,712 --> 00:20:19,654
kill a monster, talk to an NPC,

410
00:20:20,114 --> 00:20:22,576
and in our system we supported a finite amount

411
00:20:22,676 --> 00:20:23,256
of these verbs.

412
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,913
I'll give you two very simple examples

413
00:20:27,013 --> 00:20:29,718
of how that would work in practice.

414
00:20:30,098 --> 00:20:31,781
So, the simple scene.

415
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:33,724
The player, after searching through rubble,

416
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:35,947
finally finds and picks up Amulet of Yendor.

417
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:39,233
Plus one for anyone who knows what Amulet of Yendor is.

418
00:20:40,846 --> 00:20:44,188
So the major verb in this scene is pick up,

419
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:46,429
meaning the player takes and puts in their inventory.

420
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,912
And the object of that scene, the target of that action,

421
00:20:50,112 --> 00:20:51,273
is the amulet of Yendor.

422
00:20:51,493 --> 00:20:53,894
So in game logic, this would translate to obtain,

423
00:20:54,214 --> 00:20:57,456
put in inventory, and the game object is amulet of Yendor.

424
00:20:57,817 --> 00:21:00,038
Meaning once the player obtains,

425
00:21:00,118 --> 00:21:02,199
puts in their inventory the amulet of Yendor,

426
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,440
the quest will progress.

427
00:21:05,655 --> 00:21:06,916
Second very simple example.

428
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,417
In the arena, the player defeats all six opponents.

429
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:15,579
So the main verb here is defeat, which translates into

430
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:16,619
our game logic to kill.

431
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,421
And our six opponents, because we are in an arena, are

432
00:21:20,461 --> 00:21:21,041
gladiators.

433
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:21,841
And there are six of them.

434
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:26,183
So once the player kills the sixth gladiator, the quest

435
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:26,803
will progress.

436
00:21:28,383 --> 00:21:29,824
So to summarize all this.

437
00:21:30,837 --> 00:21:34,300
Lists in Horizon Zero Dawn are built as a graph of steps,

438
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,942
possible plot points, which are linked together

439
00:21:37,142 --> 00:21:39,804
by cause and effect and defined by actions

440
00:21:39,884 --> 00:21:41,286
needed to be performed by the player.

441
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:47,751
So while using our methods, we managed to succeed

442
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,113
in some areas and not so much in others.

443
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:51,974
And I would like to tell you about

444
00:21:52,314 --> 00:21:53,295
the most interesting cases.

445
00:21:54,516 --> 00:21:56,077
So let's talk about the good stuff first.

446
00:21:56,737 --> 00:22:00,599
So first of all, the graph structure did indeed assure

447
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,581
that we could create naturally and without any hacks

448
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:05,022
or workarounds non-linear quests.

449
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:09,024
Meaning everyone in the team involved in building quests

450
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:12,146
was thinking non-linearly and it was

451
00:22:12,486 --> 00:22:14,047
our main mode of operation.

452
00:22:15,164 --> 00:22:17,747
Secondly, having this limited set of verbs

453
00:22:17,867 --> 00:22:20,351
which defined actions required to progress the quest

454
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,635
made it indeed simple to create our common types of quests.

455
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,160
However, because we supported a wide enough variety

456
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,824
of these verbs, we didn't hinder our ability

457
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:31,266
to create more sophisticated ones.

458
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:37,647
Another very interesting success that we got,

459
00:22:37,847 --> 00:22:40,991
which was actually quite unexpected, was our player jobs.

460
00:22:41,631 --> 00:22:44,975
So we noticed that certain simple patterns

461
00:22:45,055 --> 00:22:48,018
which use specific verbs recur quite frequently.

462
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:51,281
And because our system was relatively strict,

463
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:53,824
we managed to automate creation of quests

464
00:22:54,004 --> 00:22:55,025
based off such patterns.

465
00:22:55,846 --> 00:22:59,309
And in the end, this ended up our player job system.

466
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:03,473
So we allow the player to generate a quest for themselves

467
00:23:04,014 --> 00:23:07,297
during gameplay for certain particular purposes.

468
00:23:07,838 --> 00:23:10,699
For example, bartering with a merchant or crafting an item.

469
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,540
So the player can choose a recipe, press a button,

470
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,661
and that will generate a quest which will guide the player

471
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:18,722
through obtaining all the necessary items

472
00:23:18,942 --> 00:23:20,083
and then crafting the item.

473
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:22,323
However, from the perspective of a player,

474
00:23:22,663 --> 00:23:25,585
a generated quest and a handcrafted quest

475
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:28,366
are not possible to distinguish.

476
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:34,428
And the most interesting problem that we faced,

477
00:23:34,448 --> 00:23:35,768
that I really would like to talk about,

478
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:35,829
is...

479
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:44,254
the time travel problem. So when you read a book, when you watch a movie, when you read a

480
00:23:44,274 --> 00:23:52,419
comic book, once a scene occurs, it occurred, right? When an event happens, it happened. It

481
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:57,282
cannot unhappen. It cannot unoccur. It's there in the timeline forever. It's there written on

482
00:23:57,322 --> 00:23:58,183
these pages forever.

483
00:23:58,883 --> 00:24:01,285
However, during gameplay, that's not always the case.

484
00:24:01,925 --> 00:24:03,686
Sometimes, for the sake of clarity

485
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:05,628
and for the sake of not confusing the player,

486
00:24:06,368 --> 00:24:08,490
and sometimes for the sake of streamlining the gameplay,

487
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,451
we allow for the story to roll back.

488
00:24:10,711 --> 00:24:12,993
We allow the story to go to the previous state.

489
00:24:14,477 --> 00:24:18,762
A good example of that happening in Horizon were our bandit camps.

490
00:24:18,782 --> 00:24:21,666
So, bandit camps were very simple quests.

491
00:24:21,806 --> 00:24:25,971
The player needs to find a bandit camp, the player needs to enter the bandit camp, and

492
00:24:26,011 --> 00:24:30,977
the player needs to perform certain activities in that bandit camp, which is usually slaughtering

493
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:31,818
of innocent bandits.

494
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,670
And the thing is that because we had this open world

495
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,313
and paradigm in our heads and wanted to give player freedom,

496
00:24:40,873 --> 00:24:42,075
once you enter the bandit camp,

497
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:43,677
it's absolutely possible to leave it.

498
00:24:44,277 --> 00:24:45,659
But the story already progressed.

499
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,362
According to the plot, according to the quest log,

500
00:24:48,642 --> 00:24:51,085
you have entered the bandit camp, kill all the bandits.

501
00:24:52,146 --> 00:24:56,488
And leaving made it actually kind of confusing for the player what's next to happen.

502
00:24:56,868 --> 00:25:00,430
So we needed to move the story back one step when the player left,

503
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:05,532
so that from the perspective of the player, they need still to reach that bandit camp and do whatever they need to do.

504
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:11,355
However, because our system was so deeply rooted in a story writing metaphor, that was not supported.

505
00:25:12,406 --> 00:25:15,269
However, we realize that this is an issue

506
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:17,691
and we are currently working on fixing it

507
00:25:17,771 --> 00:25:20,274
in a non-hacky, non-horrible way.

508
00:25:20,654 --> 00:25:22,396
We managed to work around the issue in the end,

509
00:25:22,516 --> 00:25:25,659
but we still are looking at a very appropriate solution.

510
00:25:28,562 --> 00:25:29,843
So, to close this up.

511
00:25:31,495 --> 00:25:34,317
The system that we created in our method served our purposes

512
00:25:34,377 --> 00:25:34,798
quite well.

513
00:25:35,318 --> 00:25:38,801
A team that never created a quest-based game before managed

514
00:25:38,821 --> 00:25:42,604
to create almost 150 quests of various complexity.

515
00:25:43,165 --> 00:25:45,026
And as I've been told, some of them

516
00:25:45,107 --> 00:25:47,409
actually were quite well received.

517
00:25:48,149 --> 00:25:50,151
And also we had these unexpected successes

518
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:54,214
of being able to create these player jobs, which

519
00:25:54,254 --> 00:25:56,817
is one of the coolest quality of life features that we have.

520
00:25:57,697 --> 00:25:59,198
But the system is not perfect.

521
00:25:59,238 --> 00:26:00,139
We still need to improve it.

522
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:03,341
So we still need to fix our time travel problem.

523
00:26:04,242 --> 00:26:07,084
And in the end, the list of verbs that we had

524
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,065
didn't sufficiently meet our needs.

525
00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:10,306
Some were made redundant.

526
00:26:11,287 --> 00:26:13,028
Some of them were overly specific.

527
00:26:14,008 --> 00:26:15,449
But we'll just need to revise them,

528
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:16,490
and everything will be fine.

529
00:26:19,332 --> 00:26:20,012
So that's it.

530
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:21,894
That's pretty much how we.

531
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:22,214
Thank you.

532
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:30,490
Thank you very much.

533
00:26:34,071 --> 00:26:35,512
Yeah, if anybody has any questions,

534
00:26:35,612 --> 00:26:36,772
I'm cool to answer or something.

535
00:26:39,793 --> 00:26:41,614
Two minutes, two questions I guess.

536
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,256
Hello, so have you run into any problems

537
00:26:47,316 --> 00:26:49,717
with the completionists?

538
00:26:50,257 --> 00:26:56,780
Because in this web of possible actions in your quests,

539
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:57,820
there's always...

540
00:26:58,801 --> 00:27:01,425
one way to get the most benefit of.

541
00:27:01,525 --> 00:27:03,328
And people sometimes will feel like

542
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,852
I'm not playing the game 100%

543
00:27:06,413 --> 00:27:08,836
if I don't go through all the possible steps

544
00:27:08,896 --> 00:27:11,240
I can do certain quests.

545
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,322
Do you have any?

546
00:27:12,402 --> 00:27:14,044
Well, the idea was to actually not...

547
00:27:14,525 --> 00:27:20,010
make it not even possible to play the quest in all possible ways in one single sitting.

548
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:28,257
But for completion's sake, there were key points in every quest, like one of endings or something

549
00:27:28,277 --> 00:27:34,082
like that, and these counted to the completion ratio of the whole game. So although we did

550
00:27:34,122 --> 00:27:38,225
have non-linearity, we also had these choke points sometimes for these specific purposes.

551
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:43,959
Yeah, another question?

552
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:46,900
Yeah, just something quite interesting that you mentioned.

553
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,240
You mentioned a single player action,

554
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:54,142
you know, causing and having a causal reaction

555
00:27:54,242 --> 00:27:55,802
on multiple threads in a way.

556
00:27:55,822 --> 00:28:00,723
And in this complex graph, how much interplay is there

557
00:28:00,823 --> 00:28:02,863
between the different threads in your graph

558
00:28:03,103 --> 00:28:05,344
and how do you manage that complexity?

559
00:28:05,364 --> 00:28:08,585
Because that can easily exponentially, you know, explode.

560
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,400
Okay, so the question was how do we manage actually

561
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,000
the complexity that the graph,

562
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:16,781
complexity grows exponentially with every node added.

563
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:19,222
But specifically with the interplay of,

564
00:28:19,582 --> 00:28:22,723
if there is much interplay between the threads

565
00:28:23,643 --> 00:28:24,824
in the quests, if that makes sense.

566
00:28:24,864 --> 00:28:26,884
Yeah, essentially if I understand correctly,

567
00:28:26,924 --> 00:28:29,705
if there's interplay between certain parts of a quest,

568
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:31,185
how do we manage the complexity of that?

569
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:32,926
Well, we have very good tools.

570
00:28:34,753 --> 00:28:36,673
So essentially we create a specific editor

571
00:28:36,733 --> 00:28:41,554
that allows the designer to see the state of a quest exactly,

572
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,315
which nodes are blocked, which are available,

573
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:45,375
which are completed during play through of a quest.

574
00:28:45,715 --> 00:28:47,256
So by playing a couple of times

575
00:28:47,316 --> 00:28:50,837
and seeing how everything lights up and lights down,

576
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:52,657
it's also possible to figure out

577
00:28:53,197 --> 00:28:55,658
what is not going okay, what's not right.

578
00:28:55,958 --> 00:28:58,778
Plus we had some debugging tools specific for these purposes.

579
00:28:59,258 --> 00:29:02,599
But in the end, nobody created such complicated quests

580
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:04,900
that they were impossible to figure out what's wrong with them.

581
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,941
Okay, but there wasn't that much interplay between quests?

582
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,081
Between quests, not so much.

583
00:29:10,101 --> 00:29:11,001
Okay, cool.

584
00:29:11,361 --> 00:29:12,342
Okay, thank you.

585
00:29:13,362 --> 00:29:15,382
Yeah, if anybody has more questions,

586
00:29:15,402 --> 00:29:18,743
I'll be in the wrap-up room further away in the corridor.

587
00:29:19,603 --> 00:29:19,823
Thank you.
