1
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:10,976
Thank you for joining me today. I'm Andrew Hogan, the CMO and co-founder of Intorca.

2
00:00:12,077 --> 00:00:29,852
I'm going to be talking about tackling cheating in gaming. And whilst it might not surprise you that I'm going to be telling you how important it is that we do tackle the problem of cheating, it may surprise you that I'm going to tell you the way to do this is by looking at how we find cheats. That is the key to it.

3
00:00:30,973 --> 00:00:35,297
So we set up Intorq were about just over a year ago, with a

4
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:38,821
kind of a promise of making gaming safer and fairer. And

5
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:43,485
this is supported by three key objectives. First of these was

6
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:47,389
to find and stop more cheats. The second to save time and

7
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:51,734
money doing so. And the third to protect the player experience.

8
00:00:52,418 --> 00:00:59,984
Now, I'm sure those objectives, those aims will be talked about a lot over the period of this summit.

9
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:02,566
And I think that's obviously a very good thing.

10
00:01:03,307 --> 00:01:05,168
And you'd think these are pretty unarguable.

11
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:09,251
But the one thing that's surprised us a little bit since we launched in Torca,

12
00:01:09,873 --> 00:01:15,418
was that there still seems to be, or maybe not still seems, but there is, there does seem to be

13
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:21,143
now, almost a sense of resignation about cheating amongst some people in the industry. Almost a

14
00:01:21,203 --> 00:01:27,649
feeling that it's just a cost of doing business and there's just not much we can do about it.

15
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:34,134
So you can imagine how pleased we were to see cheating featured in the Fair Play Alliance framework

16
00:01:34,214 --> 00:01:39,618
alongside issues like dangerous speech, extremism, aggravation and harassment.

17
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:44,182
Because it needs to be, because that is exactly what it is, a disruptive behaviour in gaming.

18
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:52,938
Now, the other thing that we were pleased to see was how the definition of cheating use was broader than it sometimes is.

19
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,662
So it's defined as exploiting the rules of the game to gain an advantage or disrupt play.

20
00:01:58,002 --> 00:01:59,443
This includes individual cheating.

21
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,802
and leveraging AI to cheat at scale.

22
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:04,726
And then examples given included all the usual ones

23
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:07,349
like bots, the aim bots, wallhacks, and GPS bots,

24
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:11,134
but also talked about manual and automated farming, leveling,

25
00:02:11,294 --> 00:02:18,022
boosting, netcode, loot and item finders, and data scraping.

26
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:23,523
And I think this is really important because it's no good just looking at a little, you know, one

27
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:28,644
particular niche in the sort of, if you like, in the business of cheating. The whole piece

28
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:35,586
needs to be looked at because it's also very much linked. We ran a poll just over a year ago,

29
00:02:35,606 --> 00:02:41,647
I'd say, amongst 2000 gamers, and we asked them what would make you stop playing a video game

30
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:47,548
first? And we had various rounds and the finals between these four.

31
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:54,293
slow loading speed, too many cheats, toxicity amongst players, and a lack of player support.

32
00:02:54,893 --> 00:03:01,895
Now you can see that toxicity came out as the biggest driver of people, you know, putting their

33
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:07,456
mouths down and leaving a game. But cheating was pretty close behind it, and both of these were way

34
00:03:07,476 --> 00:03:13,038
ahead of slow loading speed and lack of player support, which were the third and fourth biggest

35
00:03:13,098 --> 00:03:17,239
reasons. So that really does, I think, demonstrate how big an issue cheating is.

36
00:03:18,272 --> 00:03:22,395
It's also worth just highlighting here that the 2,000 players that we talked to,

37
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:27,599
they were not just PC players. We went into this quite agnostic actually,

38
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,846
and they were people who played all games on all sorts of consoles. So there were PC gamers there,

39
00:03:34,886 --> 00:03:38,809
there were console gamers, and there were mobile gamers.

40
00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:43,925
And I think that's really important because, you know, cheating, just as gaming is evolved,

41
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:50,907
just as gaming evolves, so does cheating. And sometimes it kind of evolves quicker as well.

42
00:03:52,047 --> 00:03:57,548
So I guess that, you know, in a way, the first question this throws up, if you like, is, well,

43
00:03:57,588 --> 00:04:05,870
how bad is it? So at first glance, and if you just look, go by some of the headlines, you know,

44
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,571
we'll see it in the game, in the games press and things.

45
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:10,571
You know, it might not be so bad.

46
00:04:10,913 --> 00:04:13,023
The industry might be getting a hold of it quite nicely.

47
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:18,938
quite well, I should say. Activision have announced back in February that Warzone bans

48
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:24,319
60,000 cheaters in one massive wave. And actually, that's been followed up recently with an announcement

49
00:04:24,339 --> 00:04:30,041
from Raven Software, who talked about half a million accounts being banned since the launch

50
00:04:30,081 --> 00:04:35,702
of Warzone. Note that's accounts and not players. That's quite important because obviously cheats

51
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:39,803
will use multiple accounts, so you'll always have more accounts banned than you will players.

52
00:04:41,135 --> 00:04:44,336
But still, you know, absolutely great to see.

53
00:04:44,816 --> 00:04:49,057
And then of course, a couple of months later, there was the bust in Kunshan, China,

54
00:04:50,258 --> 00:04:53,518
which wasn't just featured in the gaming press.

55
00:04:53,638 --> 00:04:56,979
I mean, it was all over the mainstream news.

56
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:04,161
And this gang was reputedly, I think, responsible for something like

57
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:06,521
$75 million worth of cheats being sold,

58
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:09,362
caught in a massive police sting.

59
00:05:10,361 --> 00:05:17,108
And in all the reporting of it, they featured this shot of the ill-gotten gains, in this case,

60
00:05:17,168 --> 00:05:25,296
luxury cars that the gang had managed to acquire, which obviously makes it a great news story.

61
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:32,022
But interestingly, what it reminded me of is actually my favorite TV program,

62
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:34,425
which was The Wire. It's The Wire.

63
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,251
Now, for those of you who are also fans,

64
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,032
or have seen The Wire,

65
00:05:39,452 --> 00:05:41,253
you'll recognise Buncombe McNulty there,

66
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:44,155
two of the main protagonists in the show.

67
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:48,717
And Buncombe McNulty would spend loads of time

68
00:05:49,037 --> 00:05:53,300
pushing back against their seniors and the politicians

69
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,181
who would constantly be asking

70
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,562
for loads of low-level busts to take place,

71
00:05:57,602 --> 00:06:00,844
to give them their drugs on the table photo opportunities.

72
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:07,025
And Bunk and McNulty would always kind of push back against this and try and convince them that

73
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:12,607
there's no point doing that because it just gives the gangs higher up the chance to kind of get away

74
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:17,568
if you like. And you know they knew that all these photo opportunities and drugs on the table busts.

75
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:20,629
They didn't really add up to much because there would still be loads of

76
00:06:21,009 --> 00:06:24,831
you know drug trafficking going on. There would still be lots of dealers out there.

77
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:30,656
And it's not a perfect analogy, but it did remind me when I saw the clinician bust,

78
00:06:30,796 --> 00:06:35,420
it did remind me of it. Because just as there were loads of dealers left out there,

79
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,746
there are loads of cheats, and in particular, loads of cheat sellers out there, as any gamer

80
00:06:42,766 --> 00:06:46,349
will tell you. At the moment, we're monitoring over 150 different cheat sellers.

81
00:06:49,687 --> 00:06:57,575
And that's obviously a lot, but we are under no illusion that that's all of them. I would expect

82
00:06:57,615 --> 00:07:03,281
that number to double over the next six months or so. There are so many more cheat sales out

83
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:04,382
there than people realize.

84
00:07:05,785 --> 00:07:12,329
And that, for me, is just a great proof point, if you like, of the extent of cheating,

85
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:18,232
the extent of cheating that's going on out there. I think it's also worth noting that

86
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:24,556
that is being driven by the fact that cheating is no longer PC only, and that it's

87
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:31,640
across the board now, and that you will find cheats on pretty much any game you come across,

88
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:33,641
even else's at it.

89
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:40,506
And whilst it's sort of easy to smile at the thought of a Frozen as something as innocent

90
00:07:40,546 --> 00:07:47,632
as Frozen being cheated, being pirated, this actually raises a serious problem because

91
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:53,797
as bad as cheating is when it's affecting the player experience in a big multiplayer,

92
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:59,961
and that is terrible in the long term, will damage a game's credibility and its success.

93
00:08:01,455 --> 00:08:07,797
This sort of cheating directly attacks the business model that many developers rely on,

94
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:15,580
i.e. in-app purchases and ad revenue. Now, we may not like ads in our games and stuff,

95
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,341
but developers, some of us, will be relying on that.

96
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:27,870
And these sites which are offering, you know, modified versions of the games with unlimited gems or ad blocking, etc, etc,

97
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:32,934
are directly, basically directly attacking that business model.

98
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,657
So it's a really serious issue.

99
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:45,045
And what I wanted to do now is just talk about some of the reasons why, you know, effectively,

100
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:50,195
we've got to this place. How have we let it get so bad?

101
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:57,658
So the first one of those reasons is around, the kind of obvious place to start I guess,

102
00:08:57,818 --> 00:09:04,080
is the rise of online gaming, in particular the free-to-play games. There's no doubt that that has

103
00:09:04,521 --> 00:09:08,642
coincided with a rise in cheating and has driven a rise in cheating.

104
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,313
But as well as the sort of, if you like, just the sort of hard numbers, I think what's particularly

105
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:20,459
damaging about this is that this cheating often takes place in games like Battle Royale

106
00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:25,183
games where if someone is cheating, they're seen to be cheated by loads of players in

107
00:09:25,223 --> 00:09:29,126
that game, who will obviously then go and talk about it and complain about it on social

108
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:29,867
media and stuff.

109
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:33,965
you know, they're not just cheating one other person, they're cheating a group of people.

110
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:38,786
And this kind of magnifies the problem, this just makes the problem seem even bigger than it even is.

111
00:09:40,267 --> 00:09:46,649
And, you know, and the real sort of, I think the real problem with that is that this encourages a

112
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:51,551
kind of attitude of if you can't beat them, join them. You know, if you see everyone around you

113
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:51,991
cheating.

114
00:09:53,144 --> 00:09:57,408
you know, lots of people will eventually just say, you know what, this is unfair, I want to,

115
00:09:57,688 --> 00:10:02,694
frankly, I want to level things up, I want to have the same advantages that they have.

116
00:10:02,714 --> 00:10:06,057
And this is exactly what happened with cheating in traditional sports. And it's,

117
00:10:06,358 --> 00:10:11,683
without a doubt, it's happening in this sort of, particularly in this kind of area of gaming.

118
00:10:12,824 --> 00:10:14,506
And, you know, that's a real, that's a real issue.

119
00:10:16,184 --> 00:10:22,847
It's also to an extent, I think, reflected by some attitudes in the business itself,

120
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:28,310
where you do come across a bit of a see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil,

121
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,232
head in the sand kind of stance to cheating. In that it's just kind of,

122
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:36,854
it's just one of those things that's just, it's going to always be there, just best left alone.

123
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:41,298
And actually, I think this is brought to life by, if you look at the media coverage given to

124
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:48,084
cheating, in comparison to the media coverage given to, I don't know, sort of merger, M&As,

125
00:10:48,224 --> 00:10:54,290
and investment, and sponsorships, which get tons and tons of coverage. You can't,

126
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,592
every day there's a new M&A, every day there's a new...

127
00:10:58,073 --> 00:11:03,015
multi-million investment in a developer. Every day there's a brand that's kind of now sponsoring

128
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:10,218
an esports team or an esports event. But actually, stories about Qiujing are pretty rare actually,

129
00:11:10,398 --> 00:11:14,300
you know, apart from the kind of recent sort of, apart from, actually apart from those two stories

130
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,582
I've kind of featured, there's not been much, there isn't much. And I think in a way it's great

131
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:24,144
that those positive stories get so much coverage, but we need to be, we need to be realistic and

132
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,705
honest. Because...

133
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,225
if we don't get a grip on cheating, those positive stories will dry up because sponsors,

134
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:36,668
particularly non-endemic sponsors like Coke and P&G and people, they're going to want to

135
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:45,855
be associating their brands with sports or gaming events which are inundated with cheating. It's

136
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:51,180
just not good for them. It becomes toxic. And so we need to be mindful of this.

137
00:11:55,747 --> 00:12:01,509
The third reason that cheating is kind of as established as it is now, I think comes down to

138
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:10,113
the third parties. The third parties, which in effect, unknowingly maybe, but support the cheating

139
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:16,695
ecosystem. You know, the cheating ecosystem needs payment functionality, it needs to be able to

140
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:18,116
market, it needs security.

141
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:24,636
And because, you know, cheating sites are like any other digital, sorry, any other online retailer,

142
00:12:25,016 --> 00:12:29,401
they need trust. So they go to the big brands for it because they want to have a big PayPal logo on

143
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:33,386
their site because it's going to make someone feel that much more comfortable inputting their

144
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:37,291
credit card details when they're buying a cheat or when they're subscribing to a cheat service.

145
00:12:37,852 --> 00:12:41,699
Likewise, being seen to be advertised on YouTube makes them almost seem proper.

146
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:47,789
And then making the site seem secure and stuff, particularly the rumors that you get around

147
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,471
some cheat sites.

148
00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:57,226
It's ironic, but it's obviously also frustrating when you see these brands on their sites. I'm

149
00:12:57,266 --> 00:13:02,007
sure most of them are unaware of it, but the cheat sites are making the most out of those

150
00:13:02,227 --> 00:13:07,369
business relationships. Now, the good news is this actually does offer an opportunity, I think,

151
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:14,091
which I'll come to talk about a bit later, but an opportunity for how we can potentially

152
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:18,673
disrupt the cheating or one way we can potentially disrupt the cheating ecosystem.

153
00:13:21,157 --> 00:13:26,199
Next is the, I suppose, the history of cheating, and specifically the history of

154
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:32,442
attitudes towards cheating. Because cheating didn't always seem so bad. It wasn't always

155
00:13:32,882 --> 00:13:40,626
frowned upon. It was kind of seen as a genuinely integral part of gaming. You know, when you

156
00:13:40,646 --> 00:13:44,967
watch these documentaries about the history of gaming, and you see people talking about

157
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:48,549
the first arcade games, I mean, inevitably, they'll start talking about how they used to hack them.

158
00:13:49,694 --> 00:13:51,655
to make them, actually ironically enough, to make them harder

159
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:55,196
because those arcade games are pretty simple and

160
00:13:55,216 --> 00:13:58,877
were quite easy if you spent enough, if you put enough money into it and played

161
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:01,978
it enough you'd eventually beat it. So hackers

162
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:03,418
would work out how to make it more difficult

163
00:14:03,758 --> 00:14:07,019
and then obviously also, you know, and developers also use cheating for play

164
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:07,760
testing and things.

165
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,461
and this picture brings to life, hackers were sort of heroes in kids films.

166
00:14:13,381 --> 00:14:19,663
Now this is obviously before hacking and cheating became a multi-million dollar industry,

167
00:14:20,604 --> 00:14:24,625
occasionally with links to crime, but it does bring to life how things have changed.

168
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:33,288
Or have they? Because actually there is still what I call sort of mixed opinions around

169
00:14:34,463 --> 00:14:38,304
how bad cheating is and how we should react to it.

170
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:43,645
I'm going to show you some posts from Reddit that we saw,

171
00:14:44,045 --> 00:14:48,447
which were about a month or so after the bust in China

172
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:49,807
that we just looked at.

173
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:51,928
And it had featured people talking about it.

174
00:14:52,528 --> 00:14:54,028
And I'll just read these out to you,

175
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:56,029
because it does bring to life the fact

176
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:57,109
that there's different opinions.

177
00:14:58,412 --> 00:15:02,896
So firstly, I can't believe that cheats and hacks for games are now criminal offences.

178
00:15:03,356 --> 00:15:06,338
What is this world coming to? It is the end times.

179
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,082
Like OP said, if you read the article, it's not the cheaters getting arrested,

180
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:16,545
it's the organisation making tens of millions selling cheats and hacks to subscribers.

181
00:15:17,026 --> 00:15:20,628
It's always about money. When players are paying for hacks instead of loot boxes,

182
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:23,090
that's when big business brings out the dogs.

183
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,362
Just because they're making millions doesn't mean they deserve jail time.

184
00:15:27,703 --> 00:15:29,904
Cheating in a video game doesn't actually hurt anyone.

185
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:33,787
Calling them a gang is pretty ridiculous. People should be able to modify any

186
00:15:33,847 --> 00:15:35,969
software that runs on their computer by default.

187
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,652
I don't think you read the article. They weren't just cheating, they were selling

188
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:43,134
cheats on a subscription basis for multiplayer games.

189
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,977
So should people be able to modify that software if the intent of the software

190
00:15:47,017 --> 00:15:49,178
is to be played with other people using the same software?

191
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:51,438
creating an equal playing ground?

192
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,540
What if they compete and win money over people

193
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,761
with unmodified copies?

194
00:15:56,682 --> 00:15:58,163
We're talking about actual real jail

195
00:15:58,183 --> 00:15:59,724
for cheating at video games.

196
00:15:59,884 --> 00:16:01,665
That's not really in line with the offence.

197
00:16:02,006 --> 00:16:03,687
In my opinion, it's another case

198
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:05,828
of passing responsibility off to the government.

199
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:11,845
Now, a couple of things. One, I promise you we didn't write those posts in defence of the bust,

200
00:16:12,366 --> 00:16:17,210
but also I think what this kind of, you know, neither side's probably 100% right,

201
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:21,314
but I think what it shows undeniably is that there are still different opinions about

202
00:16:21,494 --> 00:16:26,479
cheats amongst, you know, amongst, I would assume, honest players.

203
00:16:28,481 --> 00:16:28,601
Now...

204
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:42,553
The final reason, the final factor, I think, behind, you know, the sort of where we are with cheating at the moment is the is the is frankly, the speed of the cheat industry.

205
00:16:43,453 --> 00:16:47,034
This is how quick they are to market, if you like.

206
00:16:47,854 --> 00:16:52,735
What this graph shows is the noise around cheating.

207
00:16:53,968 --> 00:16:59,251
In the blue line, cheat communities themselves, so cheat forums and things, and on the red line,

208
00:17:00,491 --> 00:17:04,673
regular player communities. And it shows the noise, as I said, it shows the noise around

209
00:17:04,693 --> 00:17:10,996
cheating after a period, you know, when this game suddenly became massively popular last summer,

210
00:17:11,757 --> 00:17:15,739
from pretty much from nowhere. And you can see that sort of, you see the blue line in week four

211
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,981
there, suddenly starts to rise as cheat communities clock on to this game, start cheating it, start

212
00:17:21,001 --> 00:17:22,582
sharing cheats, start selling them.

213
00:17:23,996 --> 00:17:29,060
only takes two weeks for that to start flowing through to the player communities to start

214
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,422
complaining about the cheating on the game. And then you can see for the next few weeks

215
00:17:32,462 --> 00:17:37,706
how those lines correspond pretty closely. There's a pretty close correlation there until

216
00:17:38,647 --> 00:17:44,031
the complaints about cheating just go off the scale as people just kind of frankly just

217
00:17:45,392 --> 00:17:50,456
ditch it. And by this stage, it wasn't even just the player communities talking about

218
00:17:50,476 --> 00:17:52,578
cheating on the game, it was all over the media as well.

219
00:17:53,771 --> 00:17:57,115
and it was a well-acknowledged problem that this game had to sort it out.

220
00:17:57,416 --> 00:18:02,062
And eventually they did, and you can see the lines coming down.

221
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:06,668
Now as well as showing, I think, a strong correlation between what happens in the

222
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,891
cheating communities having a knock-on effect.

223
00:18:09,953 --> 00:18:14,957
in player communities. What this also shows is that how it was shows how developers can get

224
00:18:15,057 --> 00:18:19,360
caught out and even established developers because this was an established developer

225
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,183
but they didn't have anti-cheat set up for this game or proper anti-cheat

226
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:27,646
processes and strategies and the results are pretty clear to see.

227
00:18:29,848 --> 00:18:33,131
Now what those factors combine to do

228
00:18:34,434 --> 00:18:45,107
is create what we call the anti-cheat game of whack-a-mole, where anti-cheat teams are constantly

229
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:49,552
running around trying to get to the next cheat, knock it on the head, reverse engineer it,

230
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:52,535
and then they're off to another one, not knowing where the next one is going to come out.

231
00:18:55,488 --> 00:19:00,649
And it's amazing because we've spoken to lots of people in the industry and this analogy has come

232
00:19:00,709 --> 00:19:05,210
up so many times, we can't even claim it's original. So many people in the business refer

233
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:11,632
to dealing with cheating as like a game of whack-a-mole. And that's why we need to do

234
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,673
things differently if we're going to get a hold of cheating and tackle cheating properly.

235
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:24,135
Now, I was going to say some of you may remember this, but probably not. It was quite a long time

236
00:19:24,195 --> 00:19:30,842
ago, but I think some of you will recognize this. This is an athlete called Dick Fosbury

237
00:19:31,243 --> 00:19:37,409
competing at the 68 Mexico Olympics in the high jump, obviously. He won a gold medal.

238
00:19:38,365 --> 00:19:43,547
The interesting thing is he won this gold medal by doing the high jump in a completely new way.

239
00:19:43,987 --> 00:19:45,327
No one had done it this way before.

240
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:49,909
Up until then, people did a kind of scissors approach, or they rolled over it, kind of on their side.

241
00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:54,090
But what Dick Fosby realised is by going backwards, he could lift his legs higher,

242
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,591
and therefore clear a higher bar, because the high jump is always about, apparently,

243
00:19:57,631 --> 00:20:00,332
it's always about getting the legs over, is the tricky piece.

244
00:20:01,072 --> 00:20:03,613
Now, interestingly, at the time, everyone thought, what's the...

245
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:10,224
this is crazy. But you know, obviously, now, we all think they're great in that he's a sensible one.

246
00:20:10,704 --> 00:20:15,987
The interesting thing in this, though, is that he also was taking advantage of a technical

247
00:20:16,027 --> 00:20:21,089
development in the sport. Because up until then, people basically, they the landing area was

248
00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:26,512
basically either sand or some old mattresses. And it was only at the 68 Olympics, they brought in,

249
00:20:27,612 --> 00:20:31,694
you know, like full the full foam landing mats that you now that you see now today.

250
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:34,156
So it's interesting, as well as his kind of, you know,

251
00:20:35,641 --> 00:20:40,303
his sort of, if you like, the math that he used to work out he could get his legs higher,

252
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:45,166
there was also a tech, he was also taking advantage of a technical change to the sport.

253
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:50,188
And I think basically what this, you know, what this for me does is it says what's our

254
00:20:50,228 --> 00:20:56,652
Fosbury flop? How are we going to disrupt how we tackle cheating in gaming in the same way that he

255
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:58,733
disrupted how you did high jump?

256
00:21:00,013 --> 00:21:14,886
And for us, the Fosbury flop, the equivalent in gaming, is how we find cheats, where we look for them, and how we find them in order to get to them before they impact the game.

257
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:25,156
It's about going to where the cheats are, going to where the cheats are marketed, YouTube in this case, going to where they're discussed.

258
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:31,649
So, you know, whether that's Telegram, Twitter, Reddit, Discord.

259
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,930
And of course, going to where they're sold.

260
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:40,151
You know, whether it's I Want Cheats, no, please, no, bottom right,

261
00:21:40,191 --> 00:21:42,391
the Visa logo there, which is not a plant.

262
00:21:42,811 --> 00:21:43,971
That is that's genuine.

263
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:46,632
But actually, I think what's interesting about this site is look how professional

264
00:21:46,692 --> 00:21:49,112
it's looking. I mean, that does not look like a dodgy site.

265
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:51,793
GameProd, another one.

266
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:55,153
Omega Cheats.

267
00:21:57,553 --> 00:22:00,935
and private keys. And these are just four, these are just four

268
00:22:00,995 --> 00:22:06,598
sites out of those 150 I mentioned to you earlier. So,

269
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:09,580
you know, really, not even the tip of not even the tip of the

270
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,222
iceberg. But you can already see by going to where they're sold,

271
00:22:12,262 --> 00:22:16,224
where they're discussed and where they're marketed, you can

272
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:21,707
imagine that's going to be a lot of data coming in. And, you

273
00:22:21,747 --> 00:22:21,867
know,

274
00:22:23,207 --> 00:22:25,827
I mentioned the 150 sites that we're monitoring.

275
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:30,989
We've also, in amongst that, we reckon at the moment

276
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:35,370
we are somewhere north of 25,000 different cheat products

277
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:36,611
that we found.

278
00:22:37,171 --> 00:22:39,812
Again, we know that that number is definitely

279
00:22:39,852 --> 00:22:40,832
going to get larger.

280
00:22:41,332 --> 00:22:44,333
But it gives you an idea of how much data

281
00:22:44,353 --> 00:22:49,554
there is out there around the whole cheating space.

282
00:22:53,868 --> 00:22:58,151
Now, the question is, what can you do with that?

283
00:22:58,271 --> 00:23:02,232
How do you manage to find, how do you

284
00:23:02,553 --> 00:23:04,934
pull that data in a useful way?

285
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:10,997
And that's why we've created Intalka.

286
00:23:11,037 --> 00:23:13,938
And we've specifically, why we've

287
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:18,800
created a tech stack, which is made up of custom collectors

288
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,661
and crawlers.

289
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:25,560
to go out there and effectively monitor the dark web, the web,

290
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:31,281
and social media 24-7, looking at places like Discord, Reddit,

291
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:34,842
Telegram, all the cheap sites, YouTube, and indeed,

292
00:23:34,902 --> 00:23:35,982
the dark web as well.

293
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,523
And take all that data and ingest all that data

294
00:23:41,084 --> 00:23:45,705
and then tidy it, categorize it by community,

295
00:23:46,165 --> 00:23:48,165
and measure and evaluate it.

296
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:57,147
to kind of prioritise by risk for different teams, whether that's legal, game security or

297
00:23:57,187 --> 00:24:04,774
player support, because those are what we see as the three key teams that are going to most benefit

298
00:24:04,794 --> 00:24:09,959
from this sort of data. But so those teams can take affirmative action quicker than they can

299
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:13,803
today. So if you're a legal team, you can do a takedown much quicker.

300
00:24:14,304 --> 00:24:19,125
So if you're a game security team, you can start reverse engineering against the team much, much quicker.

301
00:24:19,345 --> 00:24:26,107
And then if you're player support, you can, you know, you can proactively go out to your community and highlight a risk, for example.

302
00:24:27,227 --> 00:24:35,009
So we have this text that pulls in this massive amount, or rather pulls out of this massive amount of data, relevant information to

303
00:24:37,536 --> 00:24:42,940
to start acting on cheats and taking action against cheats much much earlier. So we're

304
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:51,266
no longer waiting for the cheats to impact the game and we're no longer relying on effectively

305
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:56,930
manual research which we know lots of the developers and indeed some of the anti-cheat firms

306
00:24:57,531 --> 00:24:58,451
also currently rely on.

307
00:25:01,602 --> 00:25:03,784
And as you can see from that amount of data,

308
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:09,070
automating, automated monitoring is the only way through.

309
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,094
That is, if you like, automated monitoring is our FOSBRI flop.

310
00:25:13,135 --> 00:25:15,958
So let's just have a look at what that looks like in action.

311
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,422
I'll show you how it moves, and I'll

312
00:25:19,442 --> 00:25:20,603
show an animation in a second.

313
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,684
But this is effectively the heart of the Intorka platform.

314
00:25:27,964 --> 00:25:29,165
These are what we call boards.

315
00:25:29,886 --> 00:25:35,370
And these present all the data that any searches you set up.

316
00:25:36,287 --> 00:25:42,512
find. So what I mean by search is if you're using Intalka, you can set up various searches using

317
00:25:42,592 --> 00:25:49,617
our tag system. So you can search by game, you know, Apex Legends. You can search by type of

318
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:56,622
site, so you can just go for cheap vendors, or you could be more interested in Reddit posts

319
00:25:57,123 --> 00:26:03,047
or YouTube films. So you can do, or you can search actually by cheat, cheat type, so by

320
00:26:03,127 --> 00:26:04,008
aimbots for example.

321
00:26:04,877 --> 00:26:06,503
And you set up all these searches,

322
00:26:06,644 --> 00:26:08,571
and that data is pulled in in real time

323
00:26:08,691 --> 00:26:10,719
and presented on a board like this.

324
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:13,746
and I'm going to quickly show you, I said animation, it's a GIF really,

325
00:26:14,326 --> 00:26:16,907
I'm going to show you something, which I'll show you someone using this

326
00:26:17,748 --> 00:26:21,249
and effectively what I'd like you to sort of look for is how

327
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:24,710
quickly you can go from effectively looking at first person shooter

328
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:27,832
genre board to looking at a specific game

329
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:32,754
to looking at a specific cheat and then actually being in a position to download

330
00:26:33,294 --> 00:26:35,575
and start taking action against that cheat.

331
00:27:03,153 --> 00:27:08,155
So you can see within just a few clicks, we've gone from looking at all the latest cheats

332
00:27:08,215 --> 00:27:08,775
for sale.

333
00:27:09,223 --> 00:27:16,368
cheats being spoken about across first-person shooters to finding the latest aimbot available

334
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:22,371
for CSGO. So you can see immediately how we're ingesting all that data and presenting it

335
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:31,817
in a way that is usable. Now, talking of usability, you know, we are firm believers that data is only

336
00:27:31,878 --> 00:27:36,440
valuable if it gets used. You know, too often everyone talks about having lots of data, but

337
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:37,141
if you're not using it.

338
00:27:39,478 --> 00:27:44,642
it's effectively meaningless, which is why for us comprehension and shareability

339
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:52,609
are absolutely key for what we do. And as a result of that, we use a cluster analysis tool

340
00:27:53,090 --> 00:28:02,098
to make this data even easier to share with people within a business, but most importantly,

341
00:28:03,199 --> 00:28:06,381
make it easier to see where the real threats are coming from.

342
00:28:07,514 --> 00:28:11,697
because obviously this is just looking at words can be can be quite hard to do that.

343
00:28:12,138 --> 00:28:16,281
So what we've done is using this cluster analysis tool made it so that you can very quickly see

344
00:28:16,781 --> 00:28:22,146
what the biggest threats are for any game that you potentially will be interested in.

345
00:28:22,446 --> 00:28:25,788
Again I'll show you a little film of someone using our cluster analysis tool.

346
00:28:55,075 --> 00:28:55,735
So very quick.

347
00:28:59,178 --> 00:28:59,619
There you go.

348
00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:03,582
Let's play it again.

349
00:29:03,602 --> 00:29:04,443
Let's stop it.

350
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:06,905
So that, there you go.

351
00:29:07,906 --> 00:29:13,210
Now, the other thing we wanted to be able to do is make sure our data can be

352
00:29:13,271 --> 00:29:14,392
integrated very quickly.

353
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:22,157
So we've included, through our APIs, you can set up alerts so that any information that

354
00:29:22,397 --> 00:29:28,983
Intorca pulls in can be integrated into any internal system, just to make it that much

355
00:29:29,103 --> 00:29:30,845
quicker to be able to take action.

356
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,492
And then finally, the final stage of the little demo bit of this presentation,

357
00:29:35,893 --> 00:29:38,974
I wanted to talk about our crawler, because obviously this is all about

358
00:29:38,994 --> 00:29:40,155
the data that we're crawling.

359
00:29:40,575 --> 00:29:43,917
Now, when we crawl a site, we're pulling in something like 50 different

360
00:29:43,937 --> 00:29:46,839
data points behind that site.

361
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:51,641
You know, it could be, it could be who's providing, what sort of cybersecurity

362
00:29:51,662 --> 00:29:55,524
it has, what payment providers, the ISP, et cetera, it's just all the,

363
00:29:55,664 --> 00:29:57,045
all the information about that site.

364
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:00,031
But very interesting, and I mentioned this right

365
00:30:00,051 --> 00:30:01,751
at the beginning of the presentation in terms

366
00:30:01,771 --> 00:30:03,172
of these third-party providers.

367
00:30:03,752 --> 00:30:05,932
Because we're pulling in all this data,

368
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:09,153
we can see which third-party providers are being

369
00:30:09,353 --> 00:30:11,274
used by these cheat sellers.

370
00:30:12,314 --> 00:30:15,995
And what that enables us to do is, as you can see here,

371
00:30:16,355 --> 00:30:18,736
we can see, for example, that paying providers

372
00:30:18,756 --> 00:30:22,797
for this site, gamebtc.com, included PayPal, Skrill,

373
00:30:22,817 --> 00:30:24,097
Westingham, et cetera, et cetera.

374
00:30:24,968 --> 00:30:28,811
And what we're doing for one of our clients at the moment, or rather, what they're doing

375
00:30:28,851 --> 00:30:35,636
with the information we give them, is they're putting pressure on the likes of PayPal and

376
00:30:35,716 --> 00:30:38,699
Skrill, basically saying you shouldn't be working with these guys.

377
00:30:39,219 --> 00:30:43,663
As a result of that, at the very least, the payment brands, for example, in this case,

378
00:30:44,003 --> 00:30:45,044
are no longer working with them.

379
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:48,667
But actually what's happening as well is these sites, because we're disrupting them so much,

380
00:30:48,907 --> 00:30:49,348
they close.

381
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,982
And even just in the last couple of months,

382
00:30:52,022 --> 00:30:54,643
we've seen something like eight different sites completely

383
00:30:54,683 --> 00:30:56,985
close as a result of this pressure

384
00:30:57,005 --> 00:30:59,727
that we're putting on their third-party providers.

385
00:30:59,827 --> 00:31:03,249
So a direct result of using this data.

386
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:07,012
So what does this all mean?

387
00:31:08,553 --> 00:31:11,895
Well, we think it helps publishers and developers

388
00:31:12,275 --> 00:31:17,819
monitor more, more cheats, more sellers, more forums, just

389
00:31:17,859 --> 00:31:18,980
more cheating in general.

390
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:24,728
But importantly, they can do this spending less financially.

391
00:31:25,328 --> 00:31:28,931
They no longer have to rely on three man hours

392
00:31:30,012 --> 00:31:34,676
at researching cheats out there, which let's be honest,

393
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:38,379
most developers A, don't want to do and B, can't afford to do.

394
00:31:40,701 --> 00:31:43,423
It also means they can act faster and act smarter.

395
00:31:43,863 --> 00:31:46,125
You've seen how quickly we can pull this data in.

396
00:31:46,551 --> 00:31:52,096
And you can imagine that data can be very quickly used to take legal action, to start reverse engineering,

397
00:31:52,116 --> 00:31:58,581
or be a managing from a player support point of view. It also means acting smarter. Because we're looking at the

398
00:31:58,621 --> 00:32:02,684
whole cheating ecosystem and all the cheating that's out there, we can see

399
00:32:04,116 --> 00:32:07,579
when we actually evaluate the anti-cheat action you're taking.

400
00:32:07,999 --> 00:32:12,542
We can sort of see how the level of cheating may be going down in a particular game versus

401
00:32:13,443 --> 00:32:14,744
other games in that market.

402
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:19,047
So as opposed to a market effect making us think, oh, we're doing really well, no, we

403
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:21,229
can kind of take that out and actually say, no, this anti-cheat...

404
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:24,833
the strategy that you're doing is definitely working.

405
00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:26,755
It also means, as I mentioned earlier,

406
00:32:27,055 --> 00:32:29,217
by using the clusters,

407
00:32:29,257 --> 00:32:31,860
you can prioritize your resource and action.

408
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,082
You can see where the biggest threats are coming from

409
00:32:34,163 --> 00:32:35,904
rather than effectively having to guess.

410
00:32:37,251 --> 00:32:40,193
And finally, this means you've got happier players,

411
00:32:40,253 --> 00:32:41,454
there is less complaining,

412
00:32:41,754 --> 00:32:43,195
which means they're less pissed off,

413
00:32:43,815 --> 00:32:45,816
which in turn should mean your colleagues,

414
00:32:45,856 --> 00:32:47,557
in particular players for the community management,

415
00:32:47,877 --> 00:32:48,758
are also happier.

416
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:51,680
But also because they've got more tools now,

417
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,381
so that if players are complaining,

418
00:32:53,881 --> 00:32:55,942
the player support people managing those problems

419
00:32:56,282 --> 00:32:58,884
will have much more data than they've had in the past,

420
00:32:59,364 --> 00:33:00,925
and will know more about what steps

421
00:33:00,965 --> 00:33:02,626
are being taken to combat it.

422
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:09,192
And I think that's really important because if we can help those people spend less time

423
00:33:09,473 --> 00:33:12,215
worrying about cheating or having to deal with people worrying about cheating,

424
00:33:12,655 --> 00:33:17,940
that means they can spend more time dealing with these other issues, which takes us back to the

425
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:21,604
framework. They can spend more time dealing with harassment, dangerous speech,

426
00:33:21,984 --> 00:33:25,287
anti-social actions, and that can only be a good thing.

427
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:31,393
I'm not for a minute going to sit here and say we can eradicate cheating.

428
00:33:31,753 --> 00:33:34,074
There will always be people trying to make a buck from it.

429
00:33:34,294 --> 00:33:36,695
There will always be people who want to get one over.

430
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:39,796
It's just it's kind of it's it's it's the way it's the way of the world.

431
00:33:40,076 --> 00:33:43,237
But what we can do is we can reduce it and we can

432
00:33:44,237 --> 00:33:48,138
disrupt the cheating business model and the cheating ecosystem

433
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:49,779
so that there is less of it.

434
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,920
And we feel that is really important.

435
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,260
And that would itself be a big step.

436
00:33:55,382 --> 00:33:57,263
And I think I want to finish with some words

437
00:33:57,543 --> 00:34:00,224
from the framework itself, which I think

438
00:34:00,244 --> 00:34:01,965
brings to life why it's important,

439
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:03,286
why we love gaming.

440
00:34:03,866 --> 00:34:05,887
With the advent of reliable in-home networks

441
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:08,528
and other technologies, online multiplayer games

442
00:34:08,568 --> 00:34:11,009
have become an ingrained part of our social tapestry.

443
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:13,291
They enable us to make friends and escape

444
00:34:13,331 --> 00:34:15,371
the monotony and stresses of everyday life.

445
00:34:16,032 --> 00:34:18,373
Games bring people together through the power

446
00:34:18,393 --> 00:34:19,293
of shared experience.

447
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:22,215
We can fight alien invaders, explore distant lands,

448
00:34:22,595 --> 00:34:24,636
plant a garden, or push each other in a shopping cart.

449
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:28,870
At their best, games reflect the peak of humanity collaborating with one another

450
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:33,216
across what might otherwise be vast divides. Anyone can belong in a game,

451
00:34:33,616 --> 00:34:36,761
no matter where they are in the world or if they never leave their home.

452
00:34:39,384 --> 00:34:39,725
Thank you.
