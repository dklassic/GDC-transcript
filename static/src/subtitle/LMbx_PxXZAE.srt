00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:11,081
Hello everyone. Welcome to Rick and Morty Virtual Rickality.

2
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:17,783
And please silence your phones for the VR lessons learned with Alchemy Labs.

3
00:00:19,043 --> 00:00:23,004
My name is Alex Schwartz, and I'm the Chief Executive Owl of Alchemy Labs.

4
00:00:24,505 --> 00:00:28,266
And I'm Devin Reimer, Chief Technology Owl at Alchemy Labs.

5
00:00:30,288 --> 00:00:33,128
So a lot of people know us from Job Simulator.

6
00:00:33,288 --> 00:00:35,269
It was our first really big VR game.

7
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:38,749
After that, we worked on a game called

8
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:40,310
Rick and Morty, Virtual Reality, that we'll

9
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,270
be talking about today.

10
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,610
And we launched that on the Oculus and the Vive.

11
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:47,111
And on April 10, it's coming to PlayStation VR,

12
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:49,391
thanks to Adult Swim and Other Ocean.

13
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,192
Right now, we're working on a game called Vacation Simulator,

14
00:00:54,592 --> 00:00:56,553
which we're showing off on the show floor at GDC

15
00:00:56,613 --> 00:00:57,713
for the first time this week.

16
00:00:59,218 --> 00:01:00,299
And let's jump into things.

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,741
All right, so we're going to go through the origin story

18
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:05,663
of how Rick and Morty Virtual Ricality got made.

19
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:07,344
First, a disclaimer.

20
00:01:08,044 --> 00:01:10,226
This presentation has swearing.

21
00:01:10,726 --> 00:01:11,867
It has spoilers for the game.

22
00:01:12,307 --> 00:01:13,808
So just a heads up.

23
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:15,469
All right, let's begin.

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:21,233
So the origin of how this game actually began was that Chet

25
00:01:21,273 --> 00:01:23,394
from Valve ended up giving Justin Roiland,

26
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:26,056
who is the co-creator of Rick and Morty,

27
00:01:26,476 --> 00:01:28,478
and also the voice of Rick and of Morty,

28
00:01:29,115 --> 00:01:30,616
one of the early Vive dev kits.

29
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,357
And so, again, we had been fans of the show

30
00:01:34,417 --> 00:01:35,498
and we were just sitting around,

31
00:01:35,558 --> 00:01:36,998
working on our game, Job Simulator,

32
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:38,419
and he starts tweeting,

33
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,619
oh my god, who are these Job Simulator developers?

34
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:42,080
I love them, oh my god, they're geniuses.

35
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,581
And so you see the creator of one of your favorite shows

36
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:45,861
talking on Twitter about this.

37
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,962
And so we had to respond, and we're like,

38
00:01:48,322 --> 00:01:50,263
oh my god, we want to show you

39
00:01:50,303 --> 00:01:51,623
the latest levels we're working on.

40
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:54,144
And it's, I think, only about a week later,

41
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:55,625
we happened to be in L.A., so we went to.

42
00:01:56,195 --> 00:02:00,417
his home and we had some beers and Indian food and we showed him the game

43
00:02:01,117 --> 00:02:04,399
and it kind of led one one thing led to another

44
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:09,222
our plan was actually to say hey Justin I think it would actually be fun to

45
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:13,244
combine the worlds like what if Rick and Morty's like

46
00:02:13,304 --> 00:02:16,446
what if Rick's garage and Job Simulator's uh you know

47
00:02:16,786 --> 00:02:19,407
hand-based interaction what if they were together somehow

48
00:02:19,928 --> 00:02:24,730
so we have a couple clips of him seeing Job Simulator's new level for the first

49
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:24,990
time

50
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,911
and I'll play that for you now.

51
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:31,294
Oh my god, what the fuck?

52
00:02:31,354 --> 00:02:32,295
Holy shit.

53
00:02:32,775 --> 00:02:33,496
Oh shit!

54
00:02:33,776 --> 00:02:34,597
Oh my god.

55
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:36,118
You guys, shut up!

56
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,180
Heheheheh

57
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,521
Oh, it's like fucking Flappy Bird

58
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:40,982
Hahahaha

59
00:02:41,182 --> 00:02:44,024
Like, the same kind of shit in Rick's garage, just like you guys had.

60
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,205
Hehehehe

61
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:47,267
Are you fucking kidding me?

62
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:47,587
Heheheh

63
00:02:48,948 --> 00:02:51,090
So, uh, I guess he liked it, and uh...

64
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:53,974
He kind of was saying the pitch back to us

65
00:02:54,014 --> 00:02:55,554
before we really had a chance to mention

66
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:57,175
that that would be a good idea to work together.

67
00:02:57,976 --> 00:02:58,956
It was just so natural.

68
00:02:59,116 --> 00:03:02,899
And a week later, we're actually in Atlanta

69
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:05,560
at the Williams Street offices pitching Adult Swim

70
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:07,461
on the idea of some kind of combined game.

71
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:09,622
And the rest is history.

72
00:03:09,682 --> 00:03:11,423
We were going to build the game and have it funded.

73
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:16,226
So just to kind of show you some reference for what

74
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:17,207
is the game, what does it look like,

75
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:19,008
we've got a shortened version of the trailer which

76
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,208
queue up now.

77
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:26,830
What is this, Rick? It looks like some sort of crazy video game about us or something.

78
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,152
It's not just a video game, Morty. It's a virtual reality game.

79
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:33,813
I sold our likenesses to some video game publisher for a lot of money, Morty.

80
00:03:34,894 --> 00:03:35,934
I mean, who's gonna play this?

81
00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:37,114
You're gonna play this, Morty.

82
00:03:38,316 --> 00:03:39,959
Ha ha! Wubba lubba dub dub!

83
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:43,304
What? Oh my God! You killed it! I mean me!

84
00:03:43,804 --> 00:03:46,588
VR for everyone! Everyone with the box on their face morning!

85
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:49,733
It's raining money here in VR land! It's raining money!

86
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,636
Ha ha! Wubba lubba dub dub!

87
00:03:58,144 --> 00:03:59,505
All right, so how did we get here?

88
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:02,807
We had been working on something we called Alchemy VR.

89
00:04:02,827 --> 00:04:05,568
It was our internal framework for developing VR games

90
00:04:05,609 --> 00:04:07,109
with rich interactivity.

91
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:08,410
And this is what we started work on right

92
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,571
at the start of Job Simulator.

93
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:11,132
And so we got through Job Simulator

94
00:04:11,152 --> 00:04:12,212
and started work on Rick and Morty,

95
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:13,673
and we knew we had this framework.

96
00:04:13,733 --> 00:04:15,554
And we're like, okay, this will do the trick.

97
00:04:16,595 --> 00:04:18,356
Turned out that there was a lot more features

98
00:04:18,376 --> 00:04:20,657
that we needed to add for Rick and Morty,

99
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:22,218
and we ended up having to refactor

100
00:04:22,258 --> 00:04:23,419
and rewrite the entire thing.

101
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:25,280
But at least it acted as our base

102
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,581
to start work on the project.

103
00:04:28,885 --> 00:04:33,366
So, as Alex mentioned, we knew it needed to be focused on Rick's Garage.

104
00:04:33,426 --> 00:04:36,447
Like, Rick's Garage was such a cool place to be, and it was so iconic.

105
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:41,588
But in Job Simulator, we ended up building all the environments around one play space.

106
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:44,249
So, like, when you go to the kitchen in Job Simulator,

107
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:46,389
the environment is built right around that play space.

108
00:04:46,429 --> 00:04:47,310
That's the only place you go.

109
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:49,990
But everyone knows what Rick's Garage looks like,

110
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,651
and it wouldn't make sense to shrink it down to the size of a phone booth.

111
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:55,571
So, how are we going to handle that?

112
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:59,118
Because this was just so iconic in the IP,

113
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,460
and we knew it needed to be bigger than one room scale size.

114
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:04,782
So we knew we needed some locomotion solution.

115
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:08,024
So for people that have seen our talks before,

116
00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:11,706
we're not fans of bad artificial locomotion.

117
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:15,188
Comfort and accessibility are just too important for us.

118
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:16,649
We never want to make anybody sick.

119
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:24,605
So one method that a lot of people use for teleportation right now in VR is something that we refer to as granular teleportation.

120
00:05:24,665 --> 00:05:28,470
You physically point to a specific spot on the ground and then you teleport there.

121
00:05:28,731 --> 00:05:32,296
It's very easy to drop into existing content and make work.

122
00:05:33,227 --> 00:05:34,468
But it does have some limitations.

123
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:38,929
Because you can teleport anywhere, what we find is

124
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:41,610
people stop physically moving in the real world space.

125
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,691
They end up locking their legs and just like pop, pop, pop,

126
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:47,192
pop, pop around the environment, which ends up

127
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:48,393
leading to more fatigue.

128
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:50,714
The human body is not used to standing very still.

129
00:05:51,154 --> 00:05:54,775
The body wants to rock around and makes the legs end up

130
00:05:54,915 --> 00:05:56,016
feeling a lot less stress.

131
00:05:56,516 --> 00:05:59,777
It ends up also being, in our experience, a lot less fun to

132
00:05:59,877 --> 00:06:01,558
actually not physically move around.

133
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:05,252
So we needed to kind of think about how to address this.

134
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,194
Another problem is you can get yourself into really bad situations.

135
00:06:09,654 --> 00:06:12,515
So just because you can see an object that you can interact with

136
00:06:12,595 --> 00:06:14,516
doesn't mean that you can actually interact with it.

137
00:06:14,576 --> 00:06:15,977
It could be just through your wall.

138
00:06:16,277 --> 00:06:18,638
And you can end up creating really bad situations for yourself.

139
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:20,059
If you end up drifting over time,

140
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,781
you can end up getting right up against the object you want to interact with.

141
00:06:24,202 --> 00:06:26,547
not being able to reach it because it's a real-world physical wall,

142
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:31,598
and having to take a step back and then teleport forward to then engage with the item.

143
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:33,582
And that's not very intuitive for people.

144
00:06:36,984 --> 00:06:41,988
So the system that we ended up coming up for this is something we refer to as zone-based teleportation.

145
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:47,693
So you look in the direction that you want to go in a zone, and then you hit a button and then you teleport there.

146
00:06:48,113 --> 00:06:54,138
This is incredibly easy for new users to learn, and it encourages movement because it's zone-based.

147
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:57,241
So every space is designed around your play space.

148
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:02,445
It means that you'll end up being able to move around left and right while also having a teleportation mechanic.

149
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:05,928
It means that each one of these zones is like its own discrete room.

150
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,420
In the IP here, I don't know if there's a little animation here.

151
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,881
Nope, nope.

152
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:13,121
It animates on the screen.

153
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:16,122
Gotcha. So there's a little teleporter thing above the head

154
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:17,843
of the character, and it de-atomizes you

155
00:07:17,883 --> 00:07:18,883
and moves you to the next thing.

156
00:07:18,923 --> 00:07:21,844
So it grounds the teleportation mechanic right inside the game.

157
00:07:23,145 --> 00:07:25,185
And it's gaze-based, which a lot

158
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:25,966
of people don't even notice.

159
00:07:25,986 --> 00:07:27,506
They are just used to pointing their hands.

160
00:07:27,826 --> 00:07:29,667
But generally when you're just pointing your hands,

161
00:07:29,687 --> 00:07:30,807
you're also looking in that direction.

162
00:07:30,847 --> 00:07:31,588
So that works for us.

163
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:34,128
Yeah. Yeah, there you go.

164
00:07:34,758 --> 00:07:41,480
So you mentioned you know 3 room scale spaces and so we're going to see here in this video that.

165
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:56,303
Each of those spaces is actually redesigned based on the amount of space available in your actual room so we hand layout just like we did in job simulator each of those separate room scale areas so that you could have for example.

166
00:07:56,668 --> 00:07:59,329
a small version of that corner where the work desk is,

167
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:01,609
and then a medium version, and then a large version,

168
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:03,610
and then versions that are catered specifically

169
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:07,231
toward forward-facing, 180-degree tracking setups.

170
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:09,731
So based on the platform and how big your room is,

171
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:12,132
we end up scaling each room separately.

172
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,973
And so I'm going to take a top view of what the garage looks

173
00:08:16,013 --> 00:08:17,173
like in general.

174
00:08:17,613 --> 00:08:19,454
And there's something, I think, if you're

175
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:21,374
a big, big fan of the show, you might

176
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,195
have noticed when you're looking at it from the top.

177
00:08:24,558 --> 00:08:29,060
Essentially we flipped one part of the room, so I'm going to show you which part.

178
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:34,783
On the actual show, there's a shelf in what you would see on this image in the bottom left corner,

179
00:08:35,203 --> 00:08:38,484
and we moved it to the top left, so just that one mirroring element.

180
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:43,287
And the reason for that is that if you kind of bring up a couple arrows to show you,

181
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:48,249
if you're on a forward facing tracking setup where that green arrow facing up is toward the cameras,

182
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:52,511
then that means that you have good tracking forward, you have good tracking to the side.

183
00:08:52,954 --> 00:08:54,915
good tracking to the other side, but your hands

184
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:56,876
will lose tracking if you put them behind you.

185
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:59,058
So with this one small change, that

186
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:01,319
means that each of the three zones that we move between

187
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,841
has all of the active, interactable areas,

188
00:09:03,921 --> 00:09:05,723
either to the front or to the sides,

189
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:07,204
just from that one shelf move.

190
00:09:07,744 --> 00:09:10,666
And thankfully, this IP, because it's Rick and Morty,

191
00:09:10,706 --> 00:09:12,928
it's completely crazy and over the top,

192
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:15,650
we're able to have a little creative liberty with the IP.

193
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,592
And so we actually moved the shelf from the bottom

194
00:09:18,632 --> 00:09:19,012
to the top.

195
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:21,874
We added some scrape marks right next to where the shelf is,

196
00:09:21,914 --> 00:09:22,635
so that anyone who's like.

197
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:25,246
super detail and looking at it and wondering what's going on.

198
00:09:25,527 --> 00:09:28,069
They see the scrapes and then actually when the game opens up,

199
00:09:28,469 --> 00:09:31,731
Rick says something like, I had to move the whole garage around just to make this work.

200
00:09:32,152 --> 00:09:34,573
And so we just kind of throw that line in there just to be funny.

201
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,616
And you know, the IP is really great for that.

202
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,283
Now that we have this concept of zone-based teleportation,

203
00:09:44,763 --> 00:09:47,164
we have this problem where you could be standing

204
00:09:47,184 --> 00:09:49,926
at any place at any time, and you don't have control

205
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:51,787
over where you're going to go granularly,

206
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:54,329
so you could end up inside of a piece of geometry.

207
00:09:54,889 --> 00:09:56,170
So the way that we end up treating that

208
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,671
is we go in from a top-down view,

209
00:09:57,971 --> 00:10:00,012
and we go and kind of box out what are the areas

210
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,313
in which we don't want you to stand,

211
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,114
otherwise you'd be inside a piece of geometry.

212
00:10:03,374 --> 00:10:04,415
So you can see in this layout here,

213
00:10:04,435 --> 00:10:06,656
we have these three sets of boxes,

214
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,818
one in the front, and the front and the right,

215
00:10:08,898 --> 00:10:09,778
and then on the right.

216
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,240
and we go and overlay them.

217
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,141
And so when you overlay them, you end up building this little bit of a map.

218
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:18,302
And so the green area represents a safe area that we know that if the player is

219
00:10:18,342 --> 00:10:20,942
standing there, they'll never be able to teleport into a piece of geometry.

220
00:10:20,962 --> 00:10:23,583
So what we end up doing is just encouraging people

221
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:27,024
through our game design mechanics and through the layout of the room

222
00:10:27,304 --> 00:10:28,944
to end up standing in those zones.

223
00:10:29,184 --> 00:10:31,285
And it ends up working out pretty good. People don't think about,

224
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:34,306
oh, am I going to be standing in the wrong location? It just kind of works.

225
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:37,526
So.

226
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:40,990
This zone-based teleportation was kind of our next step

227
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,191
at how to build bigger worlds.

228
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,372
But it still was really limiting inside Rick and Morty.

229
00:10:44,953 --> 00:10:47,134
In Vacation Simulator, we're taking it to the next step.

230
00:10:47,294 --> 00:10:48,615
And we're really excited to talk about some

231
00:10:48,635 --> 00:10:50,195
of the innovations we're making there

232
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:51,276
at a little bit later date.

233
00:10:53,117 --> 00:10:54,978
So of course, we have to talk about portals.

234
00:10:55,478 --> 00:10:58,580
So in the show, it is one of the most iconic things

235
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,081
that happens in the IP.

236
00:11:00,677 --> 00:11:03,680
It would be crazy to omit that from the VR game,

237
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,661
and it would be so awesome, we're thinking,

238
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:06,982
like as we're getting into the design,

239
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:09,164
to walk through in room scale,

240
00:11:09,644 --> 00:11:11,345
through a portal and go into a new world.

241
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:12,987
So clearly we had to do it,

242
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:13,947
and we needed to figure out

243
00:11:14,108 --> 00:11:15,529
how we're gonna pull it off in VR.

244
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:19,472
So when we started working with Adult Swim,

245
00:11:19,872 --> 00:11:23,355
they handed us a big multi-hundred page IP Bible

246
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:25,336
that had all the details of what the characters look like

247
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:26,757
and what they do and how portals work.

248
00:11:27,158 --> 00:11:29,940
And we noticed that there was a bit of data that said that

249
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:33,807
Portals need to be shot onto a flat surface.

250
00:11:34,307 --> 00:11:36,508
And so our thought was, well, I guess

251
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:39,028
you could put a portal on one of the exterior walls

252
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:40,389
or at the edge of your play space.

253
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:42,149
But imagine you're in a room.

254
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:43,910
You've got a portal right at the edge of your play space.

255
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,230
You're going to jump through the portal

256
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,590
and smack right into a wall or hit a TV or something.

257
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,591
So we need the portal to somehow be

258
00:11:50,151 --> 00:11:53,152
not at the edge of your play space, but on a flat surface.

259
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:54,612
And how are we going to do that?

260
00:11:55,152 --> 00:11:57,433
So I've got this video here.

261
00:11:57,853 --> 00:11:58,653
This is going to show.

262
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:04,030
a lot of things all at once, but I'll let you watch it once and then we'll kind of tear it apart.

263
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:10,974
So the player is standing at the quadrant in the top left of the garage and they pull a lever with

264
00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:15,616
their right hand, thus ensuring that they're standing in a specific spot when the portal wall

265
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:22,780
comes up and opens. Now notice that there's two spots on the ground, one that's kind of one third

266
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,043
of the way to the left and two thirds of the way to the left, so when you go through a portal

267
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:33,332
You're going through your local space, you have the majority of your space and you walk into a smaller slice of this new room.

268
00:12:33,912 --> 00:12:39,434
And then the wall closes and a new wall at the opposite two-thirds opens up behind you,

269
00:12:39,914 --> 00:12:45,296
thus preventing you from clipping through one pixel too much and then going back through the same portal.

270
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:49,458
There's all these weird issues that you would end up preventing by moving the two walls.

271
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:52,699
And there's a number of other like things.

272
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:55,580
So when the wall comes up, notice it's hard to see from this angle,

273
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,801
it comes up as a small...

274
00:12:58,018 --> 00:13:02,560
pillar and then opens up wide. We noticed that if we brought up a massive wall up

275
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,581
in front of your face all at once it could be intimidating or scary or

276
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:09,103
surprising so that animation is actually very specific and there's probably a

277
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:12,985
bunch of other notes there. Do you have any more? Yeah it's it was a very tricky

278
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:16,566
thing to design. We were like for example you'll see here that something needs to

279
00:13:16,606 --> 00:13:20,628
shoot the portal and we actually have a portal gun taped up, duct-taped up on the

280
00:13:20,688 --> 00:13:23,870
ceiling that shoots this beam and so we kind of had to think of everything

281
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,471
because this universe people care so much about how it works.

282
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:31,970
So that was the game design part of portals.

283
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,751
Now we've got to think about how to actually implement them

284
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:35,431
in the engine.

285
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:37,452
So the first challenge was visual,

286
00:13:37,492 --> 00:13:38,872
like how are we going to get this to work?

287
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:41,153
So the first thing we tried was render textures.

288
00:13:41,193 --> 00:13:42,594
That seemed like the obvious thing to do.

289
00:13:43,354 --> 00:13:45,595
But as you ended up walking closer to a render texture,

290
00:13:45,615 --> 00:13:47,095
obviously the quality is going to go down

291
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,856
unless you end up making the render texture quite large.

292
00:13:49,756 --> 00:13:53,137
Also, we ended up having problems where you need to be able to seamlessly go through this portal.

293
00:13:53,618 --> 00:13:56,599
And using render textures ended up causing problems like shadow popping

294
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:59,760
and then quality mismatches as you ended up stepping through.

295
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,880
And we wanted it to be seamless.

296
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:07,663
So the new method that we ended up using was we ended up using multiple cameras and depth masks.

297
00:14:08,123 --> 00:14:11,724
So what we ended up doing is we rendered the local world, then the local skybox,

298
00:14:11,744 --> 00:14:17,527
then the remote world, then the remote skybox, and then used clipping to handle the crossovers in between.

299
00:14:21,157 --> 00:14:26,420
So that's all well and good except for unlike traditional, most traditional games with portals,

300
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:30,523
you have interaction with your hands and everything's a physics object.

301
00:14:30,563 --> 00:14:34,205
So clearly you're going to want to throw things and move things in and out through the portal.

302
00:14:34,525 --> 00:14:37,947
And our portals only count as I've stepped through it once your head goes through.

303
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:44,311
So just because your hand is through, that means your hand can be in a completely different dimension than on the other side of that.

304
00:14:45,032 --> 00:14:50,354
So what we ended up having to do is a lot of work to do things like try to maintain velocity through the worlds here.

305
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:54,937
As you can see here, you're currently standing in space in this scene, and it has no gravity in space,

306
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,318
but when it ends up entering through the portal, then gravity returns.

307
00:14:58,818 --> 00:15:02,860
We ended up having to do a lot of tricks, like for example, when you end up reaching your hand through the portal,

308
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,162
we actually duplicate that object and make it exist in the other world,

309
00:15:06,202 --> 00:15:08,443
so it can end up being seamlessly popping back and forth.

310
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:15,407
VR is really challenging from a rendering standpoint,

311
00:15:15,667 --> 00:15:17,748
and rendering two worlds simultaneously

312
00:15:17,828 --> 00:15:19,209
is incredibly challenging.

313
00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:21,269
So we ended up having to do a lot of perf tricks.

314
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:22,970
And so it's a little bit hard to see here,

315
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:25,110
but one of the perf tricks we ended up doing

316
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,571
was turning off the lighting of the world

317
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,552
that you weren't looking at at that moment

318
00:15:29,592 --> 00:15:31,072
when we knew it was completely occluded.

319
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:33,233
So you see, for example, here, it's just like, you know,

320
00:15:33,273 --> 00:15:34,673
popping back and forth.

321
00:15:34,713 --> 00:15:35,893
Some other things we ended up doing

322
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:38,614
was caching the shadows in the world

323
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:40,735
that you weren't looking at the most.

324
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:42,895
So let's say you start looking at the portal.

325
00:15:43,355 --> 00:15:45,896
Local shadows are totally real time.

326
00:15:46,156 --> 00:15:47,616
But across in the other world, they're

327
00:15:47,636 --> 00:15:49,137
currently cached from the last time

328
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:50,357
that they end up doing an update.

329
00:15:50,597 --> 00:15:52,078
But then when the portal comes into view

330
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,318
and it actually opens up, your local world shadows get cached,

331
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:57,559
and then the other side becomes real time.

332
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:59,039
And there was a lot of things like this

333
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,340
that allowed us to get to performance.

334
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:07,116
We knew we wanted this bathroom, so it was a really good gag in our game.

335
00:16:07,236 --> 00:16:09,959
And bathrooms without a mirror would be lacking.

336
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,803
And having an avatar of the character seeing yourself in the mirror would be cool.

337
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:17,669
So we started work on mirrors, and we realized that mirrors had a lot of similarity with our portal stuff.

338
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:18,750
So we started integrating that.

339
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,491
But we ended up running into this rabbit hole with perf,

340
00:16:21,571 --> 00:16:23,631
because now that we have this mirror and this portal,

341
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:25,692
you could end up looking in the mirror through the portal

342
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:26,532
into the other world.

343
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:27,992
And you're doing all this rendering.

344
00:16:28,512 --> 00:16:29,652
So the trick we ended up doing there

345
00:16:29,692 --> 00:16:31,733
was aligning things such that when you end up

346
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:33,613
focusing on the portal, we turn the mirror off.

347
00:16:33,673 --> 00:16:35,494
And as you end up turning away from the portal,

348
00:16:35,514 --> 00:16:36,314
we close the portal.

349
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:38,074
And then the mirror comes into view.

350
00:16:38,294 --> 00:16:39,934
And people don't even notice this is happening.

351
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,855
So another design element to kind of talk

352
00:16:44,915 --> 00:16:47,116
through the challenges and the inspiration for it.

353
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,621
was the death world.

354
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:52,721
So in the game, the player can die at any time,

355
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:56,002
and they could be standing in any location

356
00:16:56,042 --> 00:16:56,882
at the time of death,

357
00:16:57,582 --> 00:16:59,602
and we wanted to really avoid the,

358
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:01,783
you know, if we didn't really think about it too much,

359
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:05,103
it could be extremely punishing to die in VR.

360
00:17:05,143 --> 00:17:06,564
It could be kind of terrifying.

361
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:08,404
There's a feeling of a loss of control,

362
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:11,925
and so we wanted something that could feel comfortable

363
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,365
or as comfortable as possible

364
00:17:13,805 --> 00:17:15,685
to allow for this type of mechanic of,

365
00:17:16,129 --> 00:17:19,030
going back and coming back into the game and kind of restarting from where you were.

366
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:25,073
So a quick video of one of the many ways that you can die in Rick and Morty Virtual Reality.

367
00:17:25,453 --> 00:17:29,094
We've got a glass bottle that you throw into this pit.

368
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:34,897
And shrapnel comes up and it smashes you in the face and you die.

369
00:17:35,697 --> 00:17:41,059
So you can see there what happened is the player got brought into this new world.

370
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:43,280
And so that is the death world.

371
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,301
And so it's an instant cut.

372
00:17:45,785 --> 00:17:48,366
from the area that you're in into this brand new space.

373
00:17:48,626 --> 00:17:52,567
So the first thing we did is we have a very specific color

374
00:17:52,587 --> 00:17:54,047
scheme and lighting.

375
00:17:54,227 --> 00:17:55,528
And it's kind of a sparse environment

376
00:17:55,568 --> 00:17:57,188
so that generally you're in a world that's

377
00:17:57,248 --> 00:17:57,948
bright and colorful.

378
00:17:57,968 --> 00:18:00,769
And then most of the pixels on your screen go to black or red.

379
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,730
And so it's a pretty instant understanding of that.

380
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,391
And the other thing is, again, you

381
00:18:06,431 --> 00:18:08,772
could be at any part of your room scale space.

382
00:18:08,932 --> 00:18:11,112
And in this world, what if you're

383
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:14,333
interpenetrating some object or we don't know where you are?

384
00:18:15,254 --> 00:18:18,918
So the world is just a mostly empty space with a spotlight

385
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:22,100
and a small phone on top of a small pillar.

386
00:18:22,641 --> 00:18:24,883
And so the position and size

387
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:26,344
of that pillar was actually really important.

388
00:18:26,384 --> 00:18:28,246
We ended up tweaking it quite a bit.

389
00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:31,368
And so it's small enough that you don't feel trapped inside

390
00:18:31,388 --> 00:18:33,270
of it if you happen to be standing right in the middle

391
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,452
of the world right at the time that you died.

392
00:18:35,892 --> 00:18:37,614
That if you look down, you see the phone and you just kind

393
00:18:37,654 --> 00:18:40,076
of step back about an inch or two and then you're there.

394
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:43,493
The button, so you pick up the phone,

395
00:18:43,753 --> 00:18:48,316
and there's this kind of joke that the devil's secretary has,

396
00:18:48,896 --> 00:18:51,178
you know, you died too soon, and the devil's not here,

397
00:18:51,238 --> 00:18:52,799
and the devil's secretary, we're going to bring you back

398
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:54,260
and respawn you into the world.

399
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,482
But you could listen to these jokes

400
00:18:56,522 --> 00:18:57,743
that come through the telephone, or you

401
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,685
could re-engage at any time if you feel sick of listening

402
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:00,965
to that.

403
00:19:01,205 --> 00:19:01,886
So you hit the button.

404
00:19:02,406 --> 00:19:04,427
And all of this is taught in the first few minutes,

405
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:05,928
but the key is that.

406
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:11,576
What we're trying to do is to recenter you back into the middle of your room scale space

407
00:19:11,616 --> 00:19:14,799
so that when you go back into the game, we know exactly where you're starting at.

408
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,905
And making sure that you're not, again, coming into and interpenetrating a piece of geometry.

409
00:19:19,985 --> 00:19:23,869
So the task of how do you move the player right into the middle of the world and get them back in?

410
00:19:24,487 --> 00:19:27,249
this whole IP and this whole joke and all the phone,

411
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,030
that was all just to get the player position

412
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,031
to the right spot.

413
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:32,974
And additionally to that, a lot of times when you die,

414
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:34,915
like in that example, it's funny, right?

415
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:35,576
And that's really funny.

416
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:36,597
And we don't want people to be like,

417
00:19:36,897 --> 00:19:38,018
ha ha, that's funny, and all of a sudden

418
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:40,000
to cut to like VO as the game restarts

419
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,680
or anything like that.

420
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,122
And this gives the user a moment to decide

421
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:44,864
when they want to reengage the content,

422
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:45,945
which is really important to us.

423
00:19:48,547 --> 00:19:53,472
So when we started thinking about this game, we started working through the who you were playing in VR.

424
00:19:53,632 --> 00:19:57,376
In Job Simulator, you're playing you, you, the human, right?

425
00:19:57,836 --> 00:20:02,581
But in Rick and Morty, we weren't quite sure who you'd be. Would you be Rick? Would you be Morty?

426
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:08,066
We knew this didn't really work really well because we'd love to see Rick and Morty, you know, communicate amongst one another.

427
00:20:08,727 --> 00:20:10,008
So we knew we needed some other character.

428
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,491
The concept we came up here was Clone Morty.

429
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:19,272
So Clone Morty worked really well because Clone Morty was a silent protagonist, which you are in VR.

430
00:20:20,413 --> 00:20:24,314
And then we could turn some of the limitations in VR into jokes about how, you know,

431
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:26,335
wasn't capable of doing this stuff.

432
00:20:26,535 --> 00:20:30,436
And it made a lot more, a lot of sense because as a player you didn't know anything about this world

433
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:33,057
that you were coming into and all Rick's instructions and stuff like that.

434
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:36,198
And then Rick makes jokes like you're just being a floating head and hands and stuff like that.

435
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:37,740
which really lands really well.

436
00:20:38,081 --> 00:20:39,502
Plus you're disposable as a clone,

437
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:41,885
so you can keep dying and respawning over and over,

438
00:20:41,905 --> 00:20:42,866
and it just kind of fits with that.

439
00:20:42,906 --> 00:20:44,448
Yeah, and then Morty can also make fun of you

440
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:45,890
because you're somehow a character

441
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,572
that's lesser than Morty in the universe.

442
00:20:50,345 --> 00:20:54,427
One of the cool things that ended up coming out of this was that now that we have this avatar,

443
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:59,409
you can do things like look in the mirror. And for a lot of people, this was really cool. And

444
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:02,950
we saw a lot of videos of this. We ended up putting things like, I don't know, like a bar

445
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,931
of soap here, there's a toothbrush. And people would just go and like groom themselves in the

446
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:10,973
mirror, even though we have nothing that actually requires you to do that in the game. And it's

447
00:21:10,993 --> 00:21:14,854
something that we're thinking a lot more about in our future content. And we're diving a lot

448
00:21:14,894 --> 00:21:19,156
deeper into avatars and how they actually impact even single player games.

449
00:21:21,137 --> 00:21:25,919
So as for getting the actual characters of Rick and Morty into the game, this was a massive challenge.

450
00:21:25,999 --> 00:21:29,041
So as you know, the cartoon is a 2D cartoon.

451
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:33,403
And aside from a couple plush dolls that, you know, Adult Swim end up creating,

452
00:21:33,463 --> 00:21:37,505
there was never a 3D representation of what does Rick look like in three dimensions?

453
00:21:37,545 --> 00:21:38,305
What does Morty look like?

454
00:21:38,785 --> 00:21:43,728
So this was really the first time that we were making, that anyone was making a 3D version of the characters.

455
00:21:44,528 --> 00:21:47,549
We got our IP Bible and the reference designs of what they look like in 2D.

456
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:50,985
but that doesn't necessarily translate directly to 3D.

457
00:21:51,065 --> 00:21:54,126
So getting these characters who are going to look at you,

458
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:56,066
stand in front of you, be at full height,

459
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:58,627
animating and talking and staring at you,

460
00:21:58,767 --> 00:22:00,868
and not make that feel completely creepy

461
00:22:00,968 --> 00:22:03,268
or completely insane was a really big challenge.

462
00:22:03,868 --> 00:22:06,849
So one of the things is we wanted the characters

463
00:22:06,869 --> 00:22:09,389
to feel present in the space and kind of be

464
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:13,090
aware of where you are versus just going on long diatribes

465
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,811
and saying things with you being like a.

466
00:22:16,615 --> 00:22:18,135
invisible camera inside the world.

467
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:21,957
So one of the things we did is we have a head look

468
00:22:22,457 --> 00:22:25,258
and eye targeting system where no matter your height

469
00:22:25,438 --> 00:22:28,199
or where you are in the room, characters at times

470
00:22:28,219 --> 00:22:29,920
that they're supposed to be looking at you,

471
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,341
they will follow your position.

472
00:22:32,641 --> 00:22:35,802
We also implemented dynamic pointing.

473
00:22:35,942 --> 00:22:38,403
And so dynamic pointing was an interesting thing

474
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:41,905
that early on in the demo, we had a part that said,

475
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:45,806
Rick was saying, Clone Morty, grab this thing on the shelf.

476
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:46,166
And.

477
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,866
He wasn't pointing originally, and no one knew where to go.

478
00:22:50,406 --> 00:22:52,967
And just from the voice of like, grab the thing on the shelf,

479
00:22:53,007 --> 00:22:53,907
there's shelves everywhere.

480
00:22:54,307 --> 00:22:56,708
And so once we added the pointing,

481
00:22:57,308 --> 00:22:59,729
it really helped direct the player to exactly

482
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:00,369
where you need to go.

483
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:02,609
It's a very natural human way to point things out.

484
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,930
But because our worlds are built dynamically,

485
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,151
and based on whether you're on the small size,

486
00:23:08,191 --> 00:23:10,192
or the medium size, or the big size, or the 180 size,

487
00:23:10,612 --> 00:23:13,293
the position to where the character needs to point

488
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,733
changes slightly because we're rearranging items.

489
00:23:16,073 --> 00:23:18,535
So we needed to have the point animation be dynamic.

490
00:23:18,955 --> 00:23:22,077
And so all of that ended up helping player understanding

491
00:23:22,137 --> 00:23:24,719
and made it a much more dynamic and interesting system.

492
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,441
The other thing that we implemented

493
00:23:27,501 --> 00:23:30,203
was everyone went into the game.

494
00:23:30,363 --> 00:23:31,784
And then the first thing that happened

495
00:23:31,964 --> 00:23:33,165
as the characters started talking,

496
00:23:33,765 --> 00:23:35,546
I would say maybe 50% of people would

497
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:37,868
try to slap Morty in the face or push on Rick.

498
00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:39,970
And it was just such a natural thing.

499
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,970
You're in this cartoon.

500
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,712
You're in a cartoony world.

501
00:23:42,732 --> 00:23:43,872
You just want to do something crazy.

502
00:23:43,892 --> 00:23:44,533
And we.

503
00:23:45,712 --> 00:23:49,153
We give in to all of the other crazy player fantasies

504
00:23:49,193 --> 00:23:50,573
of throwing things at characters.

505
00:23:51,134 --> 00:23:53,694
But having the characters do some kind of reaction

506
00:23:53,774 --> 00:23:54,915
was, I think, necessary.

507
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,796
Because when you put your hand and you just

508
00:23:56,856 --> 00:23:58,256
float right through the character

509
00:23:58,296 --> 00:23:59,817
and it doesn't do anything, it's very disappointing.

510
00:23:59,957 --> 00:24:03,558
So we implemented a system of using

511
00:24:03,618 --> 00:24:05,959
a tech called Puppet Master, which ends up

512
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:10,080
using dynamic colliders to follow along

513
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,081
with a rigged system.

514
00:24:11,441 --> 00:24:13,962
And it uses spring joints and targeting

515
00:24:14,022 --> 00:24:15,222
to make sure that the character can.

516
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:18,007
kind of be pushed out of the way and then return back to a structure,

517
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:22,548
and then you'd blend between canned animations and the dynamic ragdoll.

518
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:27,350
So we customized this, and then the thing is it had a ton of perf overhead,

519
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,151
and it really slowed down the game,

520
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:32,352
and so there's a lot of optimizations late stage.

521
00:24:32,432 --> 00:24:37,093
But also when we switched from the animations to adding Puppet Master,

522
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:39,694
a ton of physics bugs emerged in the game because,

523
00:24:40,114 --> 00:24:42,535
again, the character could clip with things and then they start...

524
00:24:42,968 --> 00:24:45,669
In here, there's a video of Rick getting caught on a barrier

525
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:47,870
in the middle of his animation and getting stuck.

526
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,931
And I think, as far as a post-mortem of this tech goes,

527
00:24:52,831 --> 00:24:54,691
we feel like we didn't quite go far enough.

528
00:24:54,851 --> 00:24:57,652
Because yes, you can interact with the character

529
00:24:57,832 --> 00:24:59,932
and just slap Morty in the face.

530
00:24:59,992 --> 00:25:02,553
But I think you have to go one step further, which

531
00:25:02,613 --> 00:25:05,114
is to have Morty contextually respond

532
00:25:05,174 --> 00:25:07,554
to that kind of interaction and be interrupted

533
00:25:07,594 --> 00:25:08,834
in the middle of a sentence and go, hey,

534
00:25:08,914 --> 00:25:10,855
you know, we just didn't quite have the time

535
00:25:10,935 --> 00:25:12,715
to be able to make it a fully featured.

536
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:16,111
So it kind of feels like a lingering half implementation.

537
00:25:18,273 --> 00:25:21,175
The other thing that a ton of people ask us about is,

538
00:25:21,235 --> 00:25:24,558
you know, how did the voiceover process work?

539
00:25:24,678 --> 00:25:30,783
Because in Rick and Morty, the humor through VO is one of the most important and iconic things.

540
00:25:31,324 --> 00:25:35,867
So, as I mentioned, Justin Roiland does both Rick and Morty in the show.

541
00:25:36,608 --> 00:25:42,273
And so what we needed to do was we were actually at Alchemy writing the story, writing the lines.

542
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:46,494
and then we would do temporary recordings of impressions

543
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:48,234
of how Justin would voice the character.

544
00:25:48,294 --> 00:25:50,515
So we're doing impressions of Rick and Morty,

545
00:25:50,955 --> 00:25:53,855
putting them in the project, play testing with our lines,

546
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:56,776
and then we would send the builds over to Justin.

547
00:25:57,356 --> 00:25:59,916
He would get to play, feel out what was going on,

548
00:25:59,996 --> 00:26:02,437
and then re-record the lines over what we had recorded,

549
00:26:02,817 --> 00:26:04,957
send it back, we'd implement Justin's lines,

550
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,258
and then we would again play test to see if anything

551
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:09,938
that he changed ended up changing how gameplay worked.

552
00:26:10,358 --> 00:26:11,618
So I'm gonna show you the.

553
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,843
kind of uh evolution with two audiophiles so the first one i'm going to play is going to be

554
00:26:16,863 --> 00:26:22,347
Andrew Ike the producer on Rick and Morty at Alchemy doing a line that we recorded in-house.

555
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:26,770
Come on Morty you must have done a shit job when you tried to fix the car we broke down

556
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,793
and we need you to help us get out of this mess open up the portal wall so we can bring you here

557
00:26:31,877 --> 00:26:34,198
sent that to Justin and then he re-recorded it as,

558
00:26:34,658 --> 00:26:36,979
Hey Clone Morty, you useless piece of garbage.

559
00:26:37,579 --> 00:26:38,720
You must have done a real shit job

560
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,981
when you tried to upgrade the car.

561
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:41,601
We broke down and we need your help

562
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,662
to get us out of this mess.

563
00:26:43,362 --> 00:26:45,163
Open up the portal wall to the new location

564
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:46,143
so we can bring you here.

565
00:26:46,924 --> 00:26:49,785
So you might notice that Justin's line

566
00:26:49,865 --> 00:26:51,706
got a lot longer in time

567
00:26:52,747 --> 00:26:54,027
because I think one of the things

568
00:26:54,107 --> 00:26:56,709
is his iconic stuttering and pausing

569
00:26:56,849 --> 00:26:58,970
and the added humor and improv on it.

570
00:26:59,426 --> 00:27:03,067
is super, super funny, but it also lengthens those times.

571
00:27:03,567 --> 00:27:06,608
And we found that when you're standing there

572
00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:11,690
listening to voiceover, it depends on whether you engaged

573
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,751
with that voiceover or whether it's coming at you

574
00:27:13,811 --> 00:27:16,292
and you didn't ask for it, that there's a certain timeout

575
00:27:16,312 --> 00:27:17,812
where you start to zone out, you just don't want

576
00:27:17,832 --> 00:27:20,613
to be yelled at and talked to for a long period of time

577
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:23,754
in VR, and so we actually go through the intricacies

578
00:27:23,994 --> 00:27:26,575
of kind of the writing process, but also like the,

579
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,382
The lengthy voiceover fatigue and how we end up.

580
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:48,380
Chewing up voiceovers on demand based on player action to make it feel more like you're engaged in what's going on and all the environmental storytelling in a another GDC talk that we gave that's on the vault called spatial storytelling lessons from job sim and Rick and Morty. So check that out if you're interested in learning more there.

581
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,251
So let's dive into some game design stuff.

582
00:27:53,152 --> 00:27:56,054
Job Simulator had a premise that was really solid,

583
00:27:56,094 --> 00:27:58,675
but it didn't have a full linear story or anything like that.

584
00:27:59,156 --> 00:28:00,797
We knew Rick and Morty needed to be different.

585
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:03,279
Rick and Morty needed to feel like an episode of the show,

586
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,180
which means that it needed to have this through line,

587
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,601
this narrative that drove you through.

588
00:28:07,181 --> 00:28:11,604
We decided to use puzzles and different kinds of experiences

589
00:28:11,765 --> 00:28:13,606
as a gating mechanism through this world.

590
00:28:15,879 --> 00:28:22,183
So to jump into some case studies, one of the early things we started working on was how to get Meseeks in the game.

591
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:27,387
Meseeks are my favorite character in the show, and I know there are a lot of other people's favorite characters.

592
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:33,251
One of the problems with a Meseeks, though, in VR is that you have to verbalize to a Meseeks what you want,

593
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:35,472
and then the Meseeks will go and try to do it.

594
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:37,694
But you can't really talk in VR.

595
00:28:38,254 --> 00:28:39,435
But you can direct.

596
00:28:41,075 --> 00:28:44,137
So we need to kind of rethink what a Meseeks would be in this side of this world.

597
00:28:44,838 --> 00:28:46,779
So I'll show a video here in a second.

598
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,362
We came up with this concept of a Useeks, something that would mirror your actions.

599
00:28:51,743 --> 00:28:54,725
And so here what we're going to do is you hit this box and it spawns a ball.

600
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:58,248
And then you throw the Useeks ball and it spawns a Useeks.

601
00:28:58,856 --> 00:29:00,277
And then it mirrors you one-to-one.

602
00:29:00,797 --> 00:29:02,699
And this allows you to do a lot of really cool things.

603
00:29:02,719 --> 00:29:04,541
For example, fetch something off the driveway

604
00:29:04,621 --> 00:29:06,923
and toss it back to yourself, which creates

605
00:29:06,963 --> 00:29:08,305
a lot of really cool gameplay.

606
00:29:08,525 --> 00:29:10,006
And you can spot a whole bunch of these

607
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:11,288
and do really crazy things.

608
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:23,233
But then some weird stuff came out of that. Because it's one-to-one, as you start moving closer to a U6, what ends up happening is they get closer to you, and then they start entering your personal bubble.

609
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:27,733
And it starts feeling very uncomfortable. So we need to figure out how to get rid of them.

610
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:32,234
So one of the concepts was, let's just pull off the HMD.

611
00:29:33,415 --> 00:29:33,935
And see here.

612
00:29:35,915 --> 00:29:36,515
And then it explodes.

613
00:29:36,535 --> 00:29:42,056
So it's a really cool character in the sense that it's like a lesser version of you.

614
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:46,482
Because they kind of look the same, but you're just going to destroy them.

615
00:29:46,582 --> 00:29:51,606
And then here, for example, if you end up getting too close, it just auto-explodes,

616
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:56,471
which we thought would be really terrible, and it turns out it's a really cool mechanism to dispose of them.

617
00:29:57,672 --> 00:30:00,014
And one thing I should mention is that we went and grabbed it.

618
00:30:00,214 --> 00:30:03,577
There's another video we could show where you can go like this onto your own

619
00:30:03,677 --> 00:30:07,761
and pull off all the U-Seeks around you masked at the same time because they're mimicking your motion.

620
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:14,915
So one of the mechanics in the game that people talk about a lot is the use of the watch.

621
00:30:15,416 --> 00:30:20,060
So in the game you are able to communicate by looking down at a watch.

622
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:26,627
So the watch itself was actually prototyped as one of the earliest bits of development

623
00:30:27,547 --> 00:30:29,049
in the process, but then we threw it out.

624
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:42,782
We kind of felt like it was pointless, it was annoying, it was really hard to use, and at the time we were using the other hand's interaction to try to pull something out of the watch, like a version of Rick that would stand there.

625
00:30:43,462 --> 00:30:46,703
It just was very strange and we said, well, there's no point in this.

626
00:30:47,464 --> 00:30:52,125
And then we got to the point where we were realizing that we needed some kind of...

627
00:30:53,527 --> 00:31:22,341
Audio delivery system for Rick or Morty telling you things about like OK, you have a hint that needs to be deployed or I forget where I was in the task and I need to be reminded and so we thought well OK will put a speaker on the wall and then that's where they're going to come out of. But then we once we added portals and you go through a portal into space station or satellite. You're far from the garage and now you can't hear from out of the speaker and then we realized this is about.

628
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,731
10 months later, we're like, what if Rick were on your body?

629
00:31:26,071 --> 00:31:27,132
Oh, what if we used the watch?

630
00:31:27,172 --> 00:31:30,673
And we had actually just kind of walked away from that idea

631
00:31:30,993 --> 00:31:32,673
and came back to it strangely.

632
00:31:33,113 --> 00:31:34,954
And so, yeah, the watch is always on you.

633
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:38,935
And then once we thought, well, how do we make the watch

634
00:31:38,975 --> 00:31:39,615
interaction better?

635
00:31:39,635 --> 00:31:41,676
We're like, why don't we just look at the watch?

636
00:31:41,996 --> 00:31:44,637
And I don't know why it took us so long to just use

637
00:31:44,717 --> 00:31:46,678
the natural paradigm of how you would use a watch.

638
00:31:47,158 --> 00:31:49,678
But once we realized, oh, yeah, you just look at it.

639
00:31:50,058 --> 00:31:53,180
It became one of the most natural and usable interaction

640
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:53,921
methods in the game.

641
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:58,144
And it also has this great feature

642
00:31:58,184 --> 00:32:00,426
where if Rick wants to call you, you

643
00:32:00,506 --> 00:32:01,927
buzz the haptics on the controller,

644
00:32:02,007 --> 00:32:03,168
and you feel that on your hand.

645
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:05,210
And then you turn your hand and look at the watch.

646
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,011
And then Rick comes out and says something.

647
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:09,333
So the whole thing kind of came together

648
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:11,655
as like a strange accident where we fell upon it.

649
00:32:12,375 --> 00:32:15,518
And the other thing is that we noticed

650
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,258
that there was this.

651
00:32:17,085 --> 00:32:20,567
feeling back in Job Simulator that we were starting to have

652
00:32:20,627 --> 00:32:22,568
happen in Rick and Morty.

653
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:27,191
So the issue is essentially, it's a sandbox game.

654
00:32:27,231 --> 00:32:30,072
We want people to be free to kind of explore and do

655
00:32:30,092 --> 00:32:33,054
what they want at any time, and then on their own,

656
00:32:33,294 --> 00:32:36,255
re-engage with the content and say, OK, now I really

657
00:32:36,295 --> 00:32:37,976
want to continue with the story.

658
00:32:38,216 --> 00:32:39,577
But maybe I just want to sit here and play

659
00:32:39,617 --> 00:32:41,978
with this computer for the next hour.

660
00:32:42,536 --> 00:32:46,099
And so in Job Simulator, we had the task follow up

661
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,920
the next task, and the next task, and the next task.

662
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,001
And it felt like the game was barking at you

663
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:53,204
to just keep playing instead of feeling like you could explore.

664
00:32:53,584 --> 00:32:55,645
And then right near the end, we added this mechanic

665
00:32:55,685 --> 00:32:57,106
where you pull a ticket when you're

666
00:32:57,146 --> 00:32:58,267
ready to do the next task.

667
00:32:58,788 --> 00:33:00,389
Or in the auto mechanic, you pull a chain

668
00:33:00,489 --> 00:33:01,289
to do the next task.

669
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:04,272
And that made people feel like they weren't being rushed,

670
00:33:04,532 --> 00:33:06,713
like they could choose the time interval at which they

671
00:33:07,514 --> 00:33:09,495
get the next thing coming at them in the game.

672
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:12,137
And yeah, Rick and Morty had the same exact problem.

673
00:33:12,661 --> 00:33:14,142
and then the watch ended up solving it.

674
00:33:14,262 --> 00:33:16,422
Is that Rick kept yelling at you to do the next thing,

675
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:18,423
he kept yelling at you, and people felt like,

676
00:33:19,744 --> 00:33:21,204
oh, this game is very intense.

677
00:33:21,684 --> 00:33:23,525
And then when we finally, again,

678
00:33:23,845 --> 00:33:25,366
remembered that the watch, we brought it back,

679
00:33:25,406 --> 00:33:27,586
we added the gaze base, that ended up becoming

680
00:33:27,646 --> 00:33:29,507
the progression gating mechanism,

681
00:33:29,527 --> 00:33:32,008
because then we added these VO lines that were like,

682
00:33:32,068 --> 00:33:34,869
all right, when you're ready to do the next thing,

683
00:33:35,149 --> 00:33:36,390
call me back on the watch.

684
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,310
And that moment allowed people to go.

685
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,267
OK, I'm just going to explore and look at this stuff

686
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:41,767
and blah, blah, blah.

687
00:33:41,788 --> 00:33:44,590
And then I'll go, OK, now I'll engage with the next task.

688
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:47,332
So we kind of forgot that we learned that lesson in Job

689
00:33:47,352 --> 00:33:50,094
Simulator again and then relearned it again

690
00:33:50,134 --> 00:33:50,775
in the next game.

691
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:54,078
So hopefully that is a lesson for others.

692
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:56,640
And there's a video of looking at a watch.

693
00:33:59,476 --> 00:34:03,184
So, for people who play the game, there's this thing called the Combinator.

694
00:34:03,425 --> 00:34:05,790
It allows you to take two objects and combine them.

695
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:08,476
We refer to it as the best and worst thing that we built.

696
00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:12,547
We realized we wanted this kind of crafting thing.

697
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:15,529
Rick is all about taking parts and putting them together

698
00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:16,349
and building stuff.

699
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,530
And we wanted to kind of simulate some of that inside

700
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:18,991
VR.

701
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:22,813
The challenge with our game is we have a huge amount of items.

702
00:34:22,873 --> 00:34:25,194
Because every single item that you look at in the game you can

703
00:34:25,234 --> 00:34:26,735
interact with, that means there's

704
00:34:26,795 --> 00:34:29,416
a ton of different permutations of different items.

705
00:34:30,637 --> 00:34:32,618
The way that a lot of crafting systems handle this

706
00:34:32,658 --> 00:34:33,739
is that there's failure state.

707
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:35,880
Oh, I try something, it produces junk, right?

708
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,860
Or it produces nothing.

709
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,970
So we started experimenting with this.

710
00:34:39,851 --> 00:34:41,372
But in VR, in particular our games,

711
00:34:41,752 --> 00:34:43,573
it ended up feeling really poor.

712
00:34:43,733 --> 00:34:45,454
Because what would happen is people would be like, oh, I'm

713
00:34:45,474 --> 00:34:46,494
going to go over to that zone.

714
00:34:46,514 --> 00:34:47,194
I'm going to grab that thing.

715
00:34:47,214 --> 00:34:48,275
And I'm going to bring that thing back here.

716
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,215
I'm going to put it on the thing.

717
00:34:49,235 --> 00:34:50,816
And then you've done all this effort.

718
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:52,477
And then you hit the button and it's like, eh, eh.

719
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:53,818
And it's like, ah.

720
00:34:54,178 --> 00:34:56,139
And then what we found is as soon as you do that more than

721
00:34:56,299 --> 00:34:57,459
once, it's like, oh, OK.

722
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,660
I don't really care about this thing.

723
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,561
So we knew that that wasn't going to work.

724
00:35:03,909 --> 00:35:08,972
So we kind of went and thought about this again, and then we're like, what if instead of a crafting system,

725
00:35:09,032 --> 00:35:12,594
what if it was a combination system that worked with every single object in the game,

726
00:35:12,634 --> 00:35:14,135
that you can just combine them together?

727
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:18,617
So the first thing we did after screaming was we sat down and we're like,

728
00:35:18,697 --> 00:35:22,599
okay, let's look at a spreadsheet of every single item in the game,

729
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,621
we'll put them on both axes, and we'll start working through and seeing like,

730
00:35:25,761 --> 00:35:26,922
oh, what would this mean?

731
00:35:27,682 --> 00:35:31,945
So we started laying them out, we realized that there was 30,000 first order combinations.

732
00:35:32,325 --> 00:35:33,566
And that's first order combination.

733
00:35:33,606 --> 00:35:35,247
That's every object plus every object.

734
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:37,169
So what we ended up doing is trying to come up

735
00:35:37,189 --> 00:35:39,231
with different things like, OK, that item

736
00:35:39,251 --> 00:35:41,413
has a property that changes this geometry in this way,

737
00:35:41,453 --> 00:35:43,815
or this changes the material, or this changes a property,

738
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,116
or this creates a different object.

739
00:35:45,496 --> 00:35:47,799
And then putting a hierarchy of importance of which one

740
00:35:47,819 --> 00:35:48,859
was essentially funnier.

741
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,542
But that's just first order combinations.

742
00:35:51,822 --> 00:35:52,883
But then you want to take that thing

743
00:35:52,903 --> 00:35:54,044
and combine it with something else.

744
00:35:54,084 --> 00:35:55,045
And how do we handle that?

745
00:35:55,105 --> 00:35:56,406
And so here's a depth example.

746
00:35:57,212 --> 00:36:02,621
Now, so let's say you take a carrot in the game, and you take something that's made of glass, and you put them together, you end up getting a glass carrot.

747
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:06,928
Now, let's say you take the glass carrot, and you go combine it with a hammer, now you have a glass carrot on a hammer.

748
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,712
and then you take that glass carrot on a hammer and then you put it with a U-Seeks ball.

749
00:36:10,952 --> 00:36:15,093
When you throw the U-Seeks ball, the U-Seeks spawns with a glass carrot hammer for hands.

750
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:19,814
And this thing is completely emergent and it just kind of expands like that. It was really cool.

751
00:36:20,594 --> 00:36:23,535
But one thing I want to show you is just kind of how daunting this was.

752
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:28,356
This is the spreadsheet that we started making, and this was all the cases that we had met

753
00:36:28,516 --> 00:36:30,576
and come up with something for, and the ones we hadn't.

754
00:36:31,717 --> 00:36:33,477
And as you can see, it's just...

755
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:35,753
daunting

756
00:36:35,773 --> 00:36:39,217
uh... is and so we started going through this and being like

757
00:36:39,237 --> 00:36:43,782
home and maybe we're making a horrible horrible mistake here

758
00:36:45,284 --> 00:36:46,565
seems unmanageable

759
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:50,850
uh... and so i like okay maybe we can just like automate this thing or

760
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,490
something like that

761
00:36:52,346 --> 00:36:54,347
And so we're just like, OK, is this possible?

762
00:36:54,407 --> 00:36:56,288
And then we got thinking, it's like, oh, Scribblenauts.

763
00:36:56,328 --> 00:36:58,669
Scribblenauts is a game where you can put two things together

764
00:36:58,709 --> 00:36:59,509
and it can do things like that.

765
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:00,870
And it's like, they did it.

766
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,991
That means that we can do it.

767
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:04,211
And how do we automate this?

768
00:37:04,611 --> 00:37:06,072
And then we stumbled on this tweet.

769
00:37:06,092 --> 00:37:08,773
Someone personally that worked on Scribblenauts said that, hey,

770
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,754
everybody thought that Scribblenauts was this crazy

771
00:37:10,834 --> 00:37:12,555
data structure AI thing.

772
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:14,476
And then it turns out we just hand-authored it.

773
00:37:14,876 --> 00:37:16,517
And we're like, oh, man, I guess we're

774
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:18,298
going to have to hand-author this whole thing.

775
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:24,321
So the payoff in VR with this was super rewarding though.

776
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:26,823
We ended up seeing so many let's plays of people being like,

777
00:37:26,843 --> 00:37:30,185
like here's a video of people like, oh, I'm just going to make all the different types of poop.

778
00:37:30,925 --> 00:37:34,808
And people just love that kind of emergence that comes out of a system like this.

779
00:37:37,029 --> 00:37:42,713
So another thing that clearly we had to do was to address the elephant in the room for VR, which is Roy.

780
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:48,914
Anyone who's seen the show knows that in Blips and Chits, the arcade in the show,

781
00:37:49,274 --> 00:37:53,578
there's a arcade cabinet called Roy, and you put on this VR headset,

782
00:37:53,618 --> 00:37:56,381
and you play through the entire life of a human being,

783
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,524
and then when you die, that's the end of the game.

784
00:37:59,964 --> 00:38:03,227
And so, clearly we needed to somehow address this.

785
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:06,790
And even before we announced that we were building the game,

786
00:38:07,011 --> 00:38:09,993
and then right at the announce with all the articles and Reddit threads and everything,

787
00:38:10,437 --> 00:38:12,418
It was just, Roy, Roy, Roy, why are they not,

788
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:13,599
like, they're just gonna have to build Roy,

789
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,800
this is the big thing, we have to do it.

790
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,521
The fans had spoken, we wanted to do it,

791
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:18,962
we couldn't just, like, avoid it.

792
00:38:19,322 --> 00:38:22,644
Original Pitch Doc said, Rick's Garage and Roy.

793
00:38:23,684 --> 00:38:26,346
Yeah, question mark, figure it out, yeah.

794
00:38:26,446 --> 00:38:29,928
So, obviously this is a scope nightmare,

795
00:38:29,988 --> 00:38:32,409
you can't build a game with infinite choices

796
00:38:32,529 --> 00:38:34,310
that you make throughout an entire human life.

797
00:38:35,531 --> 00:38:38,052
But we, you know, sat down to tackle it.

798
00:38:38,432 --> 00:38:38,712
So our.

799
00:38:39,941 --> 00:38:42,942
So our solution to joke our way out of it,

800
00:38:42,962 --> 00:38:46,463
but also to address it directly, was to make Troy.

801
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:49,684
So Troy, as described by Rick when he wheels it in,

802
00:38:50,024 --> 00:38:52,485
he goes, this is the intergalactic rip-off version

803
00:38:52,525 --> 00:38:52,965
of Roy.

804
00:38:53,525 --> 00:38:57,106
And so Troy, the idea was like, OK, it's

805
00:38:57,166 --> 00:38:59,887
like the cardboard cutout version,

806
00:38:59,927 --> 00:39:02,388
but you still play through the entire life of a human being.

807
00:39:02,668 --> 00:39:04,329
We just, you know, the constraints

808
00:39:04,529 --> 00:39:07,690
led to this hilarious, like, poorly designed version

809
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:08,750
of what Roy would look like.

810
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:08,810
So.

811
00:39:10,094 --> 00:39:14,917
you still, you know, spawn in the very beginning and play and you're in a crib as a baby and you

812
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:19,099
get to pick up a toy and whether it's like you pick up the football to be like the maybe you'll

813
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,823
be a sports hero if you go down that path or you pick up this other item and then you know the even

814
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:27,585
from we used references from the show which is like there's a football coming toward you and

815
00:39:27,605 --> 00:39:30,687
you're like you know you're the high school football hero are you going to make the catch

816
00:39:30,727 --> 00:39:34,990
are you not going to make the catch and like it will affect your entire life from that point and

817
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,371
you'll go down and maybe get some diseases and get a

818
00:39:37,939 --> 00:39:40,361
Like this is just everything that happens in a whole life.

819
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:43,344
I think there were hundreds of different scenes that we ended up putting together

820
00:39:43,504 --> 00:39:46,687
and like millions of different ways to play through all the different combinations.

821
00:39:47,227 --> 00:39:52,251
But what was funny is that we prototyped it with the cardboard cutouts

822
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:54,473
so that one person could kind of like do the shoddy art.

823
00:39:55,074 --> 00:39:59,417
But then that same person who was prototyping this one mini game

824
00:39:59,777 --> 00:40:03,100
also did every single voice of every character that was in there.

825
00:40:03,449 --> 00:40:05,470
And so it didn't matter what the voice was.

826
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,530
It was basically just like, oh, I'm Troy.

827
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,211
It was just terrible.

828
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:13,292
And so the terribleness fit with the theme of the whole thing

829
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,912
being a ripoff.

830
00:40:14,332 --> 00:40:17,653
And then I guess the idea was originally, well, clearly,

831
00:40:17,673 --> 00:40:19,734
I'll record it with my crappy laptop mic

832
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:22,195
and we'll get professional voice actors later.

833
00:40:22,215 --> 00:40:23,975
But then we thought about it and we said, no, let's

834
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:26,316
leave that one developer's voices in.

835
00:40:26,356 --> 00:40:28,576
And that's what shipped in the final version.

836
00:40:29,377 --> 00:40:32,077
The cardboard cutouts ended up getting a polish pass.

837
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:33,138
But that's essentially it.

838
00:40:33,887 --> 00:40:37,589
And another fun bit about that is that the developer who

839
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,330
ended up building that, his name is Graham,

840
00:40:39,691 --> 00:40:42,632
he was one of the people who we originally worked on a game

841
00:40:42,652 --> 00:40:44,373
called Discourse together.

842
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:46,754
And Discourse, the entire design of the game

843
00:40:46,794 --> 00:40:50,597
was wildly branching, narrative, decision-based choice game.

844
00:40:50,877 --> 00:40:54,619
And so again, just a lucky prior example

845
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:57,320
of we had some tech that we could draw on and kind of build

846
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:57,720
from there.

847
00:40:58,361 --> 00:41:00,562
So that was a really funny case study.

848
00:41:01,783 --> 00:41:02,703
The other is that.

849
00:41:03,498 --> 00:41:05,818
we had to address the concept of secondary input.

850
00:41:06,258 --> 00:41:10,179
So Alchemy, we try to make games as accessible as possible.

851
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,980
And in Job Simulator, we got through the entire design

852
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,821
of the game without needing an additional button to just being

853
00:41:16,861 --> 00:41:18,401
able to pick something up with the trigger.

854
00:41:18,802 --> 00:41:20,662
So we had a menu button to exit the game.

855
00:41:20,682 --> 00:41:23,423
But essentially, the idea of, once I pick up an item,

856
00:41:23,803 --> 00:41:26,803
do I have to press a secondary button to activate the item?

857
00:41:26,843 --> 00:41:29,364
And so we had a couple things in Job Simulator that,

858
00:41:29,444 --> 00:41:31,745
like a fire extinguisher, once you pick it up,

859
00:41:32,208 --> 00:41:33,489
We actually have a button on top,

860
00:41:33,529 --> 00:41:35,429
and you use your other hand to push down on the fire

861
00:41:35,469 --> 00:41:36,009
extinguisher.

862
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:38,170
And we just kind of got our way around

863
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,410
needing a secondary button.

864
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:42,750
But then we got to Rick and Morty Virtual Reality,

865
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,451
and we said, ah, crap, we're going

866
00:41:44,471 --> 00:41:46,691
to have guns at some point in the game.

867
00:41:47,591 --> 00:41:49,172
How the heck are we going to get away

868
00:41:49,212 --> 00:41:50,832
with not using a secondary button?

869
00:41:50,912 --> 00:41:52,032
Because again, we didn't want that

870
00:41:53,172 --> 00:41:54,533
have to be memorized by the player

871
00:41:54,573 --> 00:41:57,853
to remember what button it is to both pick up and to shoot.

872
00:41:57,873 --> 00:42:00,394
And it's a big complex thing where you want to use trigger,

873
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:01,974
but then trigger is already mapped to picking up.

874
00:42:02,398 --> 00:42:06,401
So we had two examples of this and how we solved it.

875
00:42:06,681 --> 00:42:09,584
The first was we had Rick's laser gun sitting

876
00:42:09,624 --> 00:42:10,785
on the counter in the garage.

877
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:13,687
And when you pick it up, this happens.

878
00:42:14,868 --> 00:42:16,369
Initiating reverse safety.

879
00:42:18,331 --> 00:42:20,092
So it said, initiating reverse safety.

880
00:42:20,112 --> 00:42:21,354
Because it's not Rick's gun.

881
00:42:21,374 --> 00:42:23,335
It's not you holding Rick's gun.

882
00:42:23,455 --> 00:42:25,077
Or it's not him, sorry.

883
00:42:25,477 --> 00:42:26,998
And so it just starts shooting wildly.

884
00:42:27,198 --> 00:42:28,579
And that was the joke on that one.

885
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,321
So you just kind of throw it, and you're like, oh, God.

886
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:36,742
The other was that we had an actual shootout scene with guns in the game itself.

887
00:42:37,302 --> 00:42:46,584
So, the way we solved it was you go through a portal into this other world where Rick has told you he needs your help to go fix his car out on alien land.

888
00:42:46,724 --> 00:42:47,124
Spoilers.

889
00:42:47,744 --> 00:42:51,424
And you go through the portal and then the portal closes behind you.

890
00:42:51,585 --> 00:42:55,785
Most people don't notice that at the time, but there's no way back at this point.

891
00:42:56,285 --> 00:42:59,106
And so you're doing some tasks for Rick and then he says,

892
00:42:59,126 --> 00:42:59,866
Alright, you're uh...

893
00:43:01,015 --> 00:43:02,875
The car's working now, so I'm taking off.

894
00:43:02,895 --> 00:43:03,776
You're kind of stuck here.

895
00:43:03,896 --> 00:43:07,217
And by the way, we did something illegal,

896
00:43:07,257 --> 00:43:08,717
and now all the guards are coming after you.

897
00:43:08,737 --> 00:43:09,237
So good luck.

898
00:43:09,818 --> 00:43:10,638
And here's some guns.

899
00:43:10,918 --> 00:43:12,819
And your hands turn into hand cannons.

900
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,159
And so we just replace your entire hand

901
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,140
with two blast cannons.

902
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,421
And you have to have this crazy epic shootout

903
00:43:19,461 --> 00:43:22,482
with hilarious music, which will happen right here.

904
00:43:22,502 --> 00:43:24,862
So you just kind of reach down.

905
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:25,883
Your hands turn into cannons.

906
00:43:27,003 --> 00:43:27,663
And you go nuts.

907
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:30,224
And so the only way out of here at this point.

908
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:31,531
is actually to die.

909
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,573
So it's like a little mini game about how long you could stay

910
00:43:33,613 --> 00:43:35,415
alive and shoot the Gromfulmites.

911
00:43:36,516 --> 00:43:38,558
And so once you, again, go back to death world,

912
00:43:38,578 --> 00:43:40,480
you have your normal hands back, and so you could go back

913
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:43,023
to the mapping of trigger equals picking up.

914
00:43:43,343 --> 00:43:45,205
So we were able to skirt our way around

915
00:43:45,566 --> 00:43:46,947
the secondary input problem that way.

916
00:43:50,346 --> 00:43:54,687
So, one fun issue that came up was floor-level interactions.

917
00:43:54,807 --> 00:43:59,368
So, if you've seen some of the VR talks we've done in the past, I'm very passionate about floors and how they work.

918
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:08,950
We don't think that force grab, at least in the content that we do, like reaching out and pulling something from a distance, works really well because it teaches the wrong lessons.

919
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:17,652
Just like the granular teleportation I was describing before, people stand really still, people also stop moving with their hands and they kind of just go like this.

920
00:44:18,392 --> 00:44:20,133
which is not really what we want in our games.

921
00:44:20,153 --> 00:44:22,134
We want our games to be really physically engaging.

922
00:44:22,975 --> 00:44:25,957
So when things fall on the floor in Rick and Morty,

923
00:44:26,617 --> 00:44:28,098
if you're on a tracking solution that

924
00:44:28,118 --> 00:44:30,379
doesn't have floor-level tracking,

925
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,461
we need to come up with some way to handle that so you'd

926
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:34,802
be able to grab those things off the floor.

927
00:44:35,242 --> 00:44:37,263
So we came up with this concept of levitation.

928
00:44:38,387 --> 00:44:43,671
So what ends up happening is when you move your hand over top of an item and so like showing intent that you're gonna pick

929
00:44:43,691 --> 00:44:48,735
It up it actually floats up to you and then it's up to you to grab it

930
00:44:48,755 --> 00:44:53,139
It doesn't float up into your hand automatically you still have to make that engaging grab motion

931
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,140
So we're still teaching all the right mechanics

932
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:59,832
And so here you can see we're gonna reach down and grab that can and it just floats up to you

933
00:45:00,893 --> 00:45:03,114
In Rick and Morty we implemented this on

934
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:06,196
Oculus 180 and it's on PlayStation VR

935
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:12,140
One of the piece of feedback we got with play testers was some people actually really like this system

936
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:17,102
Not because it fixed their tracking problem, but because it was less fatiguing on them

937
00:45:17,463 --> 00:45:21,765
And it kind of makes sense right reaching things on the floor is actually quite a motion to do

938
00:45:22,025 --> 00:45:23,706
particularly over and over again

939
00:45:24,247 --> 00:45:27,928
And so it's something that we've actually went and thought a lot about and remastered

940
00:45:27,968 --> 00:45:32,350
and built a much more robust system that is actually the default inside of Vacation Simulator.

941
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,430
And we found that it just actually makes the game more fun.

942
00:45:38,352 --> 00:45:42,493
One thing that we ended up encountering just after launch is some people reported that

943
00:45:42,513 --> 00:45:46,055
there was this blocker, this progression blocker where they couldn't high-five Rick.

944
00:45:46,415 --> 00:45:48,776
And we're like, okay, I guess that's a thing that could happen.

945
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:52,857
And so we started working through this and we couldn't figure out what was going on.

946
00:45:53,337 --> 00:45:56,661
What ended up happening is Alex mentioned we have these different play space sizes.

947
00:45:56,741 --> 00:46:02,726
It turned out on the medium play space size, Rick's hand was positioned just outside that medium barrier.

948
00:46:02,987 --> 00:46:06,670
Which means if you had a physical wall in your real world right at the edge of that,

949
00:46:06,951 --> 00:46:10,994
you were progression blocked because Rick's hand was six inches too far through your wall.

950
00:46:12,116 --> 00:46:18,261
And so this was a thing that we missed during testing because we didn't actually have a physical wall right at the edge of our play space.

951
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:25,428
So we've ended up doing a lot of work on this from a testing standpoint and ended up adding things like for our QA side,

952
00:46:26,636 --> 00:46:30,838
when I put my hand outside of the play space tracking, it'll actually drop the object in my

953
00:46:30,878 --> 00:46:34,159
hand and disable that collider. So I couldn't high-five, I couldn't reach something that was

954
00:46:34,179 --> 00:46:37,580
outside my play space. And we're doing some experimentation with like haptics and other

955
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:41,962
feedback so that when we're testing we know that people won't get themselves in a bad state.

956
00:46:45,162 --> 00:46:51,344
When you end up having control over a world and everything is physical, people like doing what they shouldn't do, right?

957
00:46:51,364 --> 00:46:56,206
And so they'll encounter something and they're like, this is the most important object in the game, and then they'll go chuck it out the window.

958
00:46:56,987 --> 00:47:01,348
So we ended up having to go through and try to figure out how to get people not to block themselves.

959
00:47:01,849 --> 00:47:04,170
So we have these recycling systems that bring some things back.

960
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,232
But a big mechanic inside Rick and Morty was this PC,

961
00:47:07,472 --> 00:47:11,995
where you can go over to the PC at any time and reorder a part that you've had in the past.

962
00:47:12,055 --> 00:47:16,098
And so you'll never end up blocking yourself, you just go back to the computer and order yourself another one.

963
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:22,662
All right, one last fun issue was the age-old issue in video games where

964
00:47:23,102 --> 00:47:27,345
any door that has a doorknob looks like it's accessible and you're going to reach out and you're going to try to grab it,

965
00:47:27,405 --> 00:47:30,847
and then you're going to want to expect the door to open and then see the rest of the Smith household in...

966
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,762
be able to walk in that household

967
00:47:32,802 --> 00:47:35,084
and have that all modeled and fully functioning.

968
00:47:35,524 --> 00:47:38,227
So anyone who's seen any of our talks before,

969
00:47:38,547 --> 00:47:41,991
we're very, very concerned with the idea of interaction

970
00:47:42,031 --> 00:47:42,652
disappointment.

971
00:47:42,932 --> 00:47:44,413
If something looks like it's grabbable,

972
00:47:44,894 --> 00:47:46,596
you have to make it interactable.

973
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:49,599
So we just, what, remove the doorknob?

974
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,862
But this is like a TV show.

975
00:47:53,262 --> 00:47:54,063
Everyone knows the garage.

976
00:47:54,103 --> 00:47:54,844
That's a real door.

977
00:47:54,884 --> 00:47:55,725
We can't just get rid of it.

978
00:47:56,205 --> 00:47:59,408
So we ended up, again, joking our way out of this.

979
00:47:59,608 --> 00:48:01,790
And our solution was the following.

980
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:05,053
You reach out, you pick it up, real fake doors.

981
00:48:06,954 --> 00:48:10,837
So instead of a moment where you're super disappointed

982
00:48:10,857 --> 00:48:13,239
that the thing didn't work, you get a little joke

983
00:48:13,279 --> 00:48:16,422
that's based on the IP, and everyone laughs, and we move on.

984
00:48:17,163 --> 00:48:20,806
So yeah, I guess a lot of people also ask us, well,

985
00:48:20,846 --> 00:48:23,748
how was it working with a big company like Adult Swim

986
00:48:23,908 --> 00:48:24,929
on a big IP like this?

987
00:48:26,134 --> 00:48:33,060
It was absolutely fantastic to work with them because I think what it came down to is the entire relationship was built on trust

988
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:39,945
They really trusted that we would take the IP and do justice to it because we were such big fans and because we knew our

989
00:48:39,985 --> 00:48:45,510
Way around VR and so there was just I think starting at that mutual level of trust made it one of the best

990
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:52,896
Relationships we've had and so yeah, we just really want to thank them the whole team adults from games for kind of making something like this happen

991
00:48:54,578 --> 00:48:54,838
Thank you

992
00:49:03,885 --> 00:49:05,865
So it looks like we have about 10 minutes for questions.

993
00:49:06,105 --> 00:49:07,386
So if people want to come up to the mics.

994
00:49:13,987 --> 00:49:14,427
Over here.

995
00:49:14,968 --> 00:49:15,248
Hello.

996
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:16,788
Thank you for the talk.

997
00:49:17,268 --> 00:49:18,268
I was just wondering if you could

998
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,849
talk about any potential UI issues

999
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:25,010
that you experienced during your development, if any.

1000
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:29,191
I guess I'll step back and say that UI is not

1001
00:49:29,271 --> 00:49:32,792
a thing when we build spatial virtual reality games.

1002
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:38,302
But I know the translation of like, well, UI in virtual

1003
00:49:38,702 --> 00:49:41,404
reality, well, how do you deal with a menu?

1004
00:49:41,524 --> 00:49:42,605
And how do you deal with that?

1005
00:49:42,985 --> 00:49:46,767
So I guess our approach has always been, don't make a 2D

1006
00:49:46,807 --> 00:49:49,429
menu because that's how it's always been.

1007
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:54,312
Try to do something spatially, physically interaction-based

1008
00:49:54,412 --> 00:49:54,912
in our game.

1009
00:49:55,353 --> 00:49:58,154
And then anyone who's seen some of our older talks or

1010
00:49:58,215 --> 00:50:01,276
played Job Simulator knows that we ended up making this

1011
00:50:01,296 --> 00:50:02,417
thing called the exit burrito.

1012
00:50:02,924 --> 00:50:05,045
where you get a burrito and then you eat it to exit the game.

1013
00:50:05,385 --> 00:50:07,385
And so that's, I guess, a great example of a menu

1014
00:50:07,786 --> 00:50:11,067
and us ditching the whole concept of traditional UI

1015
00:50:11,287 --> 00:50:14,228
in exchange for actual physical actions and verbs

1016
00:50:14,268 --> 00:50:15,128
that you could do in the game.

1017
00:50:15,628 --> 00:50:17,689
So hopefully that answers your question.

1018
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:25,451
What sizes did you use for the small, medium, large?

1019
00:50:25,551 --> 00:50:27,092
And how did you come to those measurements?

1020
00:50:28,294 --> 00:50:40,101
Okay, so, it's 2 meters. The smallest size on 360 is 2 meters by 1.75 meters. Is that correct? 1.7 meters.

1021
00:50:40,942 --> 00:50:46,566
And then we scale that up on that same aspect ratio to 2.5 and then 3 meters.

1022
00:50:47,026 --> 00:50:53,991
And then on 180 it's 2.5 and 2 meters. Those were very early days guesses,

1023
00:50:54,011 --> 00:50:56,873
and those were based on what we ended up using in Job Simulator.

1024
00:50:57,213 --> 00:51:04,398
and the reason that those rolled out was early on valves like minimum play space size was set to

1025
00:51:04,858 --> 00:51:09,261
that minimum threshold and then we just kind of scaled it up for that up to three meters

1026
00:51:09,701 --> 00:51:12,263
and it was like oh we kind of need these different subsets.

1027
00:51:12,823 --> 00:51:14,764
Since then, we've kind of been thinking a little bit more

1028
00:51:14,804 --> 00:51:18,086
about is that the actual correct answer,

1029
00:51:18,206 --> 00:51:20,487
and how many sizes do you need, and stuff like that.

1030
00:51:21,107 --> 00:51:23,928
Some of our thinking right now with Vacation Simulator

1031
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:27,270
is maybe to bring down the max size that we have,

1032
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:29,951
because not a lot of people fall into that.

1033
00:51:30,231 --> 00:51:32,933
And so by bringing down the max and min, sorry,

1034
00:51:32,953 --> 00:51:35,894
the maximum size and the medium size a little bit,

1035
00:51:35,914 --> 00:51:38,335
we can end up getting more people to fall up a size.

1036
00:51:39,176 --> 00:51:40,617
And so we're kind of playing around with that.

1037
00:51:41,217 --> 00:51:41,617
But yeah, it's.

1038
00:51:42,097 --> 00:51:43,858
There's no magic bullet with that.

1039
00:51:43,938 --> 00:51:45,899
It's just that's kind of the conclusion that we've come to.

1040
00:51:46,299 --> 00:51:46,539
Thanks.

1041
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:47,100
Yep.

1042
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,881
And we also had some analytics in there

1043
00:51:49,961 --> 00:51:52,562
on our earlier games, which for us,

1044
00:51:53,262 --> 00:51:55,684
getting us some data so that we can try to adjust the numbers

1045
00:51:55,724 --> 00:51:57,785
and see, well, hey, let's get more people in the medium

1046
00:51:57,845 --> 00:51:59,165
and kind of simulate what that would be.

1047
00:51:59,685 --> 00:52:01,326
So hopefully at some point, we'll

1048
00:52:01,346 --> 00:52:04,608
have real data that shows that that's working or not working.

1049
00:52:06,545 --> 00:52:07,806
Hi, thanks for the really fun talk.

1050
00:52:08,466 --> 00:52:09,967
So you were describing how you had this object that

1051
00:52:09,987 --> 00:52:11,388
let you combine any two objects.

1052
00:52:11,448 --> 00:52:13,669
And you started mapping the interactions one on one.

1053
00:52:13,689 --> 00:52:14,829
And then you thought maybe you could do it

1054
00:52:14,889 --> 00:52:15,730
the Scribblenaut style.

1055
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,271
And then you found out that the Scribblenaut style

1056
00:52:17,311 --> 00:52:18,131
was doing it all one to one.

1057
00:52:18,171 --> 00:52:21,273
So at that point, what was your process going forward?

1058
00:52:21,293 --> 00:52:23,955
Did you manually go through each and every interaction?

1059
00:52:23,995 --> 00:52:25,235
Or how did you deal with that?

1060
00:52:28,269 --> 00:52:34,395
There was a little bit crying and then we, the mythology there was to like take every

1061
00:52:34,535 --> 00:52:38,399
object and be like, hey what is the most important property of this item?

1062
00:52:38,439 --> 00:52:42,723
It's like, oh this item is very metal and it's like maybe there'll be like a cool metal

1063
00:52:42,763 --> 00:52:44,184
shader that we'll put on that thing.

1064
00:52:44,964 --> 00:52:49,307
And then we ended up just walking through all the hundreds and hundreds of objects and

1065
00:52:49,327 --> 00:52:53,310
then seeing what works, but then finding, oh, these things, when they put these two

1066
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:57,312
things together, you kind of want the specific case and things like that.

1067
00:52:57,753 --> 00:53:02,636
For example, it's like, oh, I want to combine an apple and a banana and it makes a...

1068
00:53:03,056 --> 00:53:06,817
fruit bar, like a protein bar with an apple, banana, protein bar.

1069
00:53:07,118 --> 00:53:10,499
And so it's not just like shader things, like physically, like

1070
00:53:10,659 --> 00:53:13,840
the bar text will change and be like those physical things.

1071
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,842
We found that that stuff works really well and we learned that really early on in

1072
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:19,062
Job Simulator.

1073
00:53:19,142 --> 00:53:22,463
One of the earlier gags that we ended up showing there was when you made soup and

1074
00:53:22,484 --> 00:53:24,544
you put like a bunch of items in the pot

1075
00:53:24,904 --> 00:53:27,926
and then it turned into a can of soup and then it said like, you know, like

1076
00:53:28,946 --> 00:53:30,106
plate, banana.

1077
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:32,869
and cockroach soup, and then people were like,

1078
00:53:32,989 --> 00:53:33,729
oh, that's so great.

1079
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:36,552
And we kind of just leaned into that on some of those,

1080
00:53:36,572 --> 00:53:37,413
and it works really well.

1081
00:53:38,494 --> 00:53:38,934
OK, thank you.

1082
00:53:39,094 --> 00:53:41,937
Yeah.

1083
00:53:41,957 --> 00:53:43,238
Hi, a quick question.

1084
00:53:43,378 --> 00:53:46,020
Did you handle variation in player height in any way

1085
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:46,821
throughout the experience?

1086
00:53:49,738 --> 00:53:58,961
So, as Alex mentioned, we have like, you know, the eyes track you and head tracks you and things like that to make sure that they're always looking in the right spot.

1087
00:53:59,501 --> 00:54:06,922
We go and layout our counters to as close to like, you know, the acceptable size for dealing with like a standing desk, for example.

1088
00:54:07,723 --> 00:54:16,845
But then we also have in both games, we have a shorter human mode in Job Simulator and then a... what is it called?

1089
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:18,694
Giant Morty mode.

1090
00:54:18,714 --> 00:54:20,995
That was like, we flipped it, so that was funny.

1091
00:54:21,155 --> 00:54:24,657
Which ends up scaling the entire world, which makes the world

1092
00:54:24,697 --> 00:54:25,757
feel a little bit different.

1093
00:54:25,877 --> 00:54:28,879
But if you're not nearly as tall,

1094
00:54:28,919 --> 00:54:30,260
it might make things more accessible.

1095
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,621
So yeah, that's kind of stuff that we've done there.

1096
00:54:38,244 --> 00:54:42,507
Possibly dumb question, but how does the developer

1097
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:45,608
who is an amateur voice actor feel now that he's famous?

1098
00:54:48,837 --> 00:54:59,027
So, how does Graham feel? I don't know how Graham feels. Well, I do know that Graham has like the most titles of anyone, I think, at our company.

1099
00:54:59,047 --> 00:55:08,037
Well, it's arguable, but he's done development, he's done programming, design, art, some audio, and now voice acting, so he's able to add one more...

1100
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:10,952
line item to his credits on the game.

1101
00:55:10,972 --> 00:55:13,973
He came in as a 3D modeler, now he's our tech director.

1102
00:55:14,093 --> 00:55:17,033
So he's a jack of all trades.

1103
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:18,674
Thank you.

1104
00:55:20,754 --> 00:55:22,735
And if there's no further questions,

1105
00:55:22,855 --> 00:55:27,195
I will just skip through really strange bugs and images

1106
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:31,256
and screen captures of terrible moments during development

1107
00:55:32,317 --> 00:55:34,777
and see if any of these inspire any further questions.

1108
00:55:53,729 --> 00:55:58,310
These are some of the earliest prototype videos that we salvaged from the first couple months

1109
00:55:58,350 --> 00:55:58,971
of development.

1110
00:56:00,771 --> 00:56:05,713
Turns out an AI pathfinding creature in a world where you can move stuff around is really

1111
00:56:05,753 --> 00:56:06,033
hard.

1112
00:56:15,203 --> 00:56:17,805
We got to experience this stuff in VR so you didn't have to.

1113
00:56:17,825 --> 00:56:30,275
All right, last one is this one.

1114
00:56:30,395 --> 00:56:35,959
That bottom middle video where the head look was stuck on you, that is one of the creepiest.

1115
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,461
Just look at that face.

1116
00:56:40,043 --> 00:56:40,903
He's still looking.

1117
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:43,959
Yeah.

1118
00:56:45,381 --> 00:56:45,641
All right.

1119
00:56:46,082 --> 00:56:47,724
Oh, wait.

1120
00:56:48,265 --> 00:56:48,546
One more.

1121
00:56:49,587 --> 00:56:54,834
With that many items in the game, what did you have to do to optimize the engine for

1122
00:56:54,894 --> 00:56:55,415
unity, I guess?

1123
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:02,322
I mean if you can have like a thousand different objects of different types in the game all at once, that's gotta be something, right?

1124
00:57:03,303 --> 00:57:07,825
Yeah, the biggest overhead we end up having from stuff like that is physics.

1125
00:57:08,445 --> 00:57:15,828
Physics, in Unity in particular, it's all on the main thread, and your logic's generally on the main thread, so that ends up being problematic.

1126
00:57:17,109 --> 00:57:20,731
What we end up doing is we optimize the game not for the top.

1127
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:24,612
And so a lot of game design is like,

1128
00:57:24,672 --> 00:57:27,294
okay, I got it just under 11 milliseconds of frame,

1129
00:57:27,654 --> 00:57:28,474
now I'm good.

1130
00:57:28,674 --> 00:57:30,155
And that's not good for us.

1131
00:57:30,175 --> 00:57:32,556
So we need to actually pull it down quite a bit to give yourself,

1132
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:35,457
to give the player a lot of clearance on top of that,

1133
00:57:35,497 --> 00:57:37,618
so they can end up doing a lot of crazy things.

1134
00:57:37,798 --> 00:57:39,739
And if you end up getting really, really crazy,

1135
00:57:39,759 --> 00:57:42,740
you can crush frame rate if you really want.

1136
00:57:43,881 --> 00:57:46,362
But for a vast majority of players, they never encounter it.

1137
00:57:46,582 --> 00:57:47,562
And the people that do are like,

1138
00:57:47,782 --> 00:57:50,343
well, clearly the game was not going to work when I did that.

1139
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:51,233
Yeah.

1140
00:57:51,554 --> 00:57:53,734
Yeah.

1141
00:57:54,134 --> 00:57:55,934
Do you guys have any thoughts on scaling

1142
00:57:55,955 --> 00:57:57,815
your predefined locomotion system

1143
00:57:57,855 --> 00:57:59,315
to more of an open world style?

1144
00:58:02,476 --> 00:58:04,576
So, I mean, that's essentially what

1145
00:58:04,596 --> 00:58:06,737
we're doing with Vacation Simulator,

1146
00:58:06,777 --> 00:58:09,877
is to take the idea of node-based teleportation

1147
00:58:10,298 --> 00:58:11,998
and apply it to a much larger world.

1148
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:14,899
And so we've learned a ton about how

1149
00:58:14,919 --> 00:58:16,439
you design a world from the ground up

1150
00:58:16,479 --> 00:58:18,939
when you know that you want to make different areas that

1151
00:58:18,979 --> 00:58:19,960
are very specifically.

1152
00:58:20,847 --> 00:58:23,847
connected to each other and have very specific, you know,

1153
00:58:23,887 --> 00:58:26,408
I'm at this area to do this thing and now I'm at this area

1154
00:58:26,428 --> 00:58:29,988
to do this thing versus the granular just I'll go anywhere

1155
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,528
and I might have to click, I might have

1156
00:58:31,548 --> 00:58:34,389
to teleport three times to go across this long field

1157
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:36,329
where there's nothing, it's just sparse and empty.

1158
00:58:36,869 --> 00:58:39,530
So, you know, trying to keep things filled

1159
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:41,710
with interactivity and interesting for players

1160
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:43,450
and logical and visible

1161
00:58:43,871 --> 00:58:46,111
and understandable is a really big challenge.

1162
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:48,911
And I think likely when we get to the point

1163
00:58:48,931 --> 00:58:49,812
that we're post-morteming.

1164
00:58:50,355 --> 00:58:56,117
Vacation simulator will probably have many many slides about all the weird stuff that we learned as we're kind of doing that now

1165
00:58:56,737 --> 00:58:58,817
In that game, it's very hard, but very rewarding

1166
00:58:59,597 --> 00:59:07,319
Yeah, I had a question about the spectator mode and about the design and performance challenges you guys had creating that

1167
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:09,279
Yeah

1168
00:59:09,659 --> 00:59:11,900
Well, I guess I'll start with like well, how did we even come up with it?

1169
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:19,182
It was we think that you know in general it's like really not amazing to just watch the unwarped eye view on a screen

1170
00:59:20,289 --> 00:59:21,290
of someone playing in VR.

1171
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:24,492
And so the thought was, well, what if we had like virtual cameras

1172
00:59:24,532 --> 00:59:26,974
and you could grab them and move them around and point them around.

1173
00:59:27,515 --> 00:59:28,676
And that was in Job Simulator.

1174
00:59:29,096 --> 00:59:32,499
And so we brought that into Rick and Morty directly.

1175
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:37,002
But now take that idea and everything he said about portal rendering

1176
00:59:37,123 --> 00:59:40,365
and mirrors that look through mirrors into portals and then combine

1177
00:59:40,405 --> 00:59:42,327
that with, well, let's render the whole thing again

1178
00:59:42,367 --> 00:59:45,509
from a different spot while also driving everything

1179
00:59:45,529 --> 00:59:47,971
that the HMD needs to see on a single graphics card.

1180
00:59:48,031 --> 00:59:48,151
So.

1181
00:59:48,702 --> 00:59:49,762
Definitely challenges.

1182
00:59:50,302 --> 00:59:53,963
On PC VR, there's a lot of people with a lot of high-performance rigs.

1183
00:59:55,343 --> 00:59:58,284
When we enable spectator mode, we inform the user,

1184
00:59:58,324 --> 01:00:01,064
hey, this could impact frame rate, and try to put it in their hands.

1185
01:00:01,505 --> 01:00:04,645
But we've been doing a lot of thinking about how to bring spectator,

1186
01:00:04,825 --> 01:00:07,646
like the spectator experience to more people on hardware

1187
01:00:07,666 --> 01:00:09,786
that isn't quite so powerful.

1188
01:00:09,867 --> 01:00:11,827
But yeah, we're still doing some experimentation there.

1189
01:00:12,847 --> 01:00:13,127
Thank you.

1190
01:00:13,807 --> 01:00:15,328
And with that, thanks so much.
