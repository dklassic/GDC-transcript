00:00:00,529 --> 00:00:05,694
Hi everyone, welcome to the GDC Twitch channel. My name is Brian Francis. I am the invisible voice inside your head

2
00:00:06,095 --> 00:00:13,102
I'm here as always representing GDC as the community manager representing the fine folks at Gamma Sutra

3
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:13,542
Oh boy

4
00:00:14,163 --> 00:00:15,364
This is a new puzzle

5
00:00:17,186 --> 00:00:18,527
Oh man, also, why is my

6
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:22,580
Uh, hang on.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,761
Okay, sorry, I'm going to do the intro and then I'm going to worry about this game.

8
00:00:24,821 --> 00:00:26,401
Okay, cool, that's intentional.

9
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:30,642
Hi, I'm Bryant, I'm a contributing editor at Gamasutra, I'm a community manager at GDC.

10
00:00:30,942 --> 00:00:34,784
In the lower left hand corner of the screen, my friend Alex Walro has joined us today.

11
00:00:34,804 --> 00:00:36,624
Alex, how are you doing?

12
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:38,465
I'm doing alright.

13
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:42,906
I just realized how odd it is that because of a camera mix-up, I'm the only face on here.

14
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:45,796
And yet I'm the least interesting person on this stream.

15
00:00:45,816 --> 00:00:47,217
We have a very special guest with us today.

16
00:00:47,237 --> 00:00:47,958
A very special guest.

17
00:00:47,978 --> 00:00:50,539
Would you please tell everyone who you are and what you do?

18
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,720
OK.

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:52,581
Hello there.

20
00:00:52,841 --> 00:00:53,721
I'm Arvi Teikari.

21
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:58,204
I'm the developer of Baabai Zuu, and I was kindly asked to

22
00:00:59,365 --> 00:01:02,127
be the disembodied voice on the stream

23
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:05,389
to describe possibly what is happening on screen.

24
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,730
I mean, some other things.

25
00:01:09,254 --> 00:01:12,897
Why don't we open a puzzle that just broke my brain is all I can say

26
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:20,602
Baba is you is a game developer choice award nominee this year. That's why we are here streaming it with our feet

27
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:28,948
Are we also this game one? So it was nominated it didn't win. It was nominated back at the IGF's in 2017 or did it?

28
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:29,929
18 yeah

29
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:34,151
It was nominated in four categories and it won two categories

30
00:01:34,832 --> 00:01:35,933
Yeah, like oh, yeah

31
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,309
It was nominated in Grand Prize Innovation or Nouveau Award,

32
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,196
the Excellence in Design and Best Student Game,

33
00:01:45,236 --> 00:01:47,702
and it won Excellence in Design and Student.

34
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,900
Right on, with that in mind, we are here,

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,860
oh, nope, don't want to do that.

36
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:58,142
We are here playing Baba this year with Arvi,

37
00:01:58,182 --> 00:02:00,723
just taking your questions, chatting about the game design and development,

38
00:02:00,843 --> 00:02:04,184
after seeing it do so well at the awards this year.

39
00:02:04,204 --> 00:02:05,984
We just wanted to come back and chat with Arvi

40
00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:07,765
and see how things are going.

41
00:02:07,785 --> 00:02:09,866
You're working on a level editor, right, Arvi?

42
00:02:10,946 --> 00:02:15,648
Yeah, we are going to release a level editor sometime this year.

43
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:22,463
I was really hoping for a spring release date, but as it happens, things always take longer than expected,

44
00:02:22,503 --> 00:02:29,226
so at this point I'm trying to avoid promising any dates, but yeah, it will be sometime this year.

45
00:02:29,846 --> 00:02:33,367
It's surprisingly difficult, like when you're a game developer,

46
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:36,148
you sometimes want to make a level editor for your own use,

47
00:02:36,548 --> 00:02:41,450
and there you can just hide everything behind obscure button combinations,

48
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:45,031
but when you make a level editor for, like, actual users...

49
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:50,522
you kind of have to make it nice to use and that's surprisingly difficult.

50
00:02:51,903 --> 00:02:52,263
Right on.

51
00:02:52,863 --> 00:02:58,146
While I try to figure out this puzzle right here and mostly just embarrass myself, would

52
00:02:58,186 --> 00:03:02,409
you mind getting into, I should also give a shout out to the folks in chat, we've got

53
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,290
folks like Ryder of Blox hanging out.

54
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:10,094
Ryder, thanks for joining us, we'll be taking questions from folks like you as we go on,

55
00:03:10,154 --> 00:03:13,696
so if you have questions for Arvi, please feel free to put them in chat.

56
00:03:14,717 --> 00:03:19,201
I'm going to set about trying to solve this puzzle, so Arvi, I'm going to ask you a question and then go do that,

57
00:03:19,221 --> 00:03:21,163
because this is really hard on my brain.

58
00:03:21,183 --> 00:03:23,345
Would you mind, I know,

59
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:28,009
would you mind retelling the story of where Baba is you came from and how you took it from

60
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,191
prototype to full-fledged indie game?

61
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:36,077
That's a very nice big question. Gives plenty of time for the puzzles.

62
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:36,137
So...

63
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:44,345
I was at the Nordic Game Jam, which is one of these events where people make games in

64
00:03:44,385 --> 00:03:46,527
a time limit following a loose theme.

65
00:03:46,847 --> 00:03:48,648
Game jams are kind of popular nowadays.

66
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:54,713
I guess most people are, maybe at least to some extent, aware of the concept.

67
00:03:54,753 --> 00:03:59,798
But anyway, the Nordic Game Jam is one of my favorites.

68
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,380
It's a very cozy, nice jam held in Copenhagen every year.

69
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:04,461
And I was there in 2017.

70
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:05,482
I was actually going there to...

71
00:04:08,202 --> 00:04:15,663
meet my friends, because I have a lot of friends in Copenhagen and I had existing projects

72
00:04:15,903 --> 00:04:20,724
that I wanted to work on, so I was actually kind of sneakily going to the event with this

73
00:04:20,764 --> 00:04:25,765
mindset that, okay, I don't mind if I don't make a game for the jam, I'm here for the

74
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:27,985
like social element of it.

75
00:04:28,905 --> 00:04:35,426
But then the theme of the game jam was released, or revealed, it's a very loose jam, like

76
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:35,907
you are not this.

77
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:42,941
supposed to be super strict about following the theme, you are free to interpret it however you

78
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:50,369
want, and the theme was not there, which kind of... I just pondered about it. Congratulations,

79
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:57,798
nice work on the level. Thank you. So I thought about the theme and for some reason I don't...

80
00:04:58,643 --> 00:05:05,849
no idea why, I latched onto the first part, the not word, and started thinking how in logic and

81
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:13,276
I guess programming, you can say, have a like concept, something like push, and you can inverse

82
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:20,583
or reverse its meaning by saying not push. So not has this kind of reversal meaning in some contexts.

83
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:22,104
And the...

84
00:05:22,674 --> 00:05:27,277
I had played some really good puzzle games over the past couple of years.

85
00:05:27,397 --> 00:05:30,640
For example, Steve and Sausage Roll and Snake Bird,

86
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,403
two extremely difficult but very satisfying, very enjoyable puzzle games I had liked a lot.

87
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:38,005
And Raid, several years earlier.

88
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:42,428
All those games had kind of filled me with a desire to make a puzzle game.

89
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:45,390
But I had always run into some design problems.

90
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,913
There were some things I couldn't kind of get working when I tried to make my own puzzle games.

91
00:05:50,862 --> 00:05:55,123
And the kind of inspiration I had gathered over years from these puzzle games

92
00:05:56,363 --> 00:05:59,504
wobbled in my head as I thought about this not-there theme.

93
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:06,125
And eventually they just kind of combined together into this mental image

94
00:06:06,305 --> 00:06:11,587
of like a block pushing game, where there would be a pool of lava,

95
00:06:12,047 --> 00:06:14,927
some blocks of ice, and the ice...

96
00:06:15,828 --> 00:06:16,508
Congratulations!

97
00:06:18,148 --> 00:06:19,468
The ice would be meltable.

98
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,922
in the lava, obviously, because lava is hot, ice is meltable.

99
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:26,424
But then you would be, as a player, able to say

100
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:28,686
ice is not melt.

101
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:31,267
And that's kind of the, as far as I can remember,

102
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:33,048
that's kind of the beginning of the idea.

103
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:37,812
And, uh, yeah, I wasn't super certain about the idea at first.

104
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:41,174
It sounded like, uh, it would be maybe a bit dull

105
00:06:41,474 --> 00:06:44,856
or it would be difficult to figure out puzzles for that kind of a concept.

106
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:48,739
And also I wasn't really sure at first what kind of a game it would be.

107
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:53,705
But I started working on it, because one of the nice things about Game Jams is that I can just...

108
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:59,369
I just decided, okay, I'll do something. If it doesn't work, I can scrap it. I don't have to think about it anymore.

109
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:04,834
I can go cry in a corner. If it works, I can be happy and get friends.

110
00:07:05,594 --> 00:07:12,320
And so I just started prototyping it, and it turned out to be working pretty well.

111
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,624
And other people also, they kind of came to look over my shoulder and said that, hey, that looks super cool.

112
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,340
are pretty cool at least.

113
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,822
And that encouraged me.

114
00:07:22,023 --> 00:07:23,524
And I ended up winning the Game Jam,

115
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:26,386
like being voted the best game of the Game Jam.

116
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,569
And that's combined with that encouragement

117
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:32,291
from my colleagues convinced me

118
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,772
that I should make a full game out of it.

119
00:07:33,852 --> 00:07:34,933
And then two years later,

120
00:07:36,574 --> 00:07:38,836
things happened and the game was released.

121
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:42,158
Yeah, I'd say some things happened for sure.

122
00:07:42,198 --> 00:07:44,320
I mean, you won those awards, the game came out,

123
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,321
it seemed to do quite well.

124
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:49,111
Something we didn't mention at the top of the show, you are nominated this year for two

125
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:54,515
Game Developers Choice Awards at GDC. I think it's Best Design and maybe Best Debut,

126
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:59,218
or Most Innovation, I think. I think it's Innovation and Design, yeah. Yeah, Innovation

127
00:07:59,238 --> 00:08:03,501
and Design, quite right. And those are really incredible awards to be up for, and I think Baba,

128
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:09,825
as you, is eminently deserving of that. When you talk about... No worries. When you talk about

129
00:08:11,173 --> 00:08:14,876
the process of implementing that basic idea during the jam and seeing that it worked pretty well,

130
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:18,419
I feel like you might be glossing over a lot there. I really want to know,

131
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:24,524
like, how did it work at first? Because this, the entire idea, this negation of,

132
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:30,109
well, the approach to the design, like, I've never seen anything like this in a commercial game

133
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,872
that I can recall, and I would guess that it must have been real tricky to implement.

134
00:08:35,613 --> 00:08:39,756
Uh, hmm. Well, first of all, the whole

135
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:47,822
not there, like the not word kind of disappeared in development because pretty quickly when I

136
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:53,785
started working on the prototype I realized that it's actually thematically way cooler

137
00:08:54,406 --> 00:09:00,969
if the lava is not hot by default and the ice is not meltable by default like if nothing has

138
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:08,353
inherent abilities but instead everything is stated by the rules. It felt just like a way

139
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:09,473
cooler thing in my head.

140
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:13,853
But also it kind of invalidated the whole not thing.

141
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:19,196
Why say ice is not melt if the ice isn't melt by default anyway?

142
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:24,500
So that's kind of one of the first things that happened when I started working on the game.

143
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:29,462
But to be honest, because especially at Game Jams,

144
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:34,445
you don't really worry about implementing things well.

145
00:09:34,966 --> 00:09:36,747
You can just hack things in.

146
00:09:39,142 --> 00:09:42,844
The only thing you need to care about is that you have something that at least seems to work

147
00:09:43,544 --> 00:09:48,447
after the 48 or 72 hours or however long the game jam takes or lasts.

148
00:09:49,447 --> 00:09:50,968
So with BaBaIsYou I kind of...

149
00:09:51,828 --> 00:09:56,631
I had fairly recently, only about a year ago, I had learned the Lua scripting language

150
00:09:57,371 --> 00:10:02,214
and I fairly quickly figured out a pretty simple syntax that would let me just kind of...

151
00:10:04,242 --> 00:10:10,623
read the rules on the screen, put all those rules on a list, or actually on a couple of different lists,

152
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:18,505
and then let me, on runtime, ask the game, like, hey, does this rule exist, or is something you?

153
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:24,106
If something is you, please return all the things that are you, and then I can do something for all those things that are you.

154
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:31,728
So the kind of basic system of the game is built very largely around this,

155
00:10:31,768 --> 00:10:33,888
kind of asking these questions of, hey, game.

156
00:10:34,366 --> 00:10:37,928
Please tell me everyone who fulfills this requirement.

157
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:42,910
Especially later on when I added this kind of conditional words,

158
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,031
spoiler alert,

159
00:10:44,331 --> 00:10:48,013
eventually there will be conditionals that can be added to the rules.

160
00:10:48,793 --> 00:10:50,254
So especially when those were added,

161
00:10:50,674 --> 00:10:53,215
it became even more important to have these kind of...

162
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:57,197
Please return me all the things that are you,

163
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:01,399
while also taking into account all these kind of conditionals or special...

164
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:08,850
cases that might appear and those special cases are where the development became like really tricky.

165
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,451
I would say that the basic rule system is actually fairly simple but there are some

166
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:21,934
certain areas where the game even now is not working at all perfectly and when I release

167
00:11:21,954 --> 00:11:29,397
the level editor I will probably spend endless hours pulling my hair out trying to make some

168
00:11:29,457 --> 00:11:31,538
kind of a passable compromise between

169
00:11:32,554 --> 00:11:35,855
things working and me dying of old age.

170
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:38,295
That actually brings us to a good question from chat,

171
00:11:38,335 --> 00:11:39,816
which is, oh, I have a question.

172
00:11:39,836 --> 00:11:41,696
What's the most challenging thing you've encountered

173
00:11:41,716 --> 00:11:43,276
when developing the level editor?

174
00:11:43,596 --> 00:11:45,317
That comes from writer of blocks.

175
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:48,238
Yeah, thanks for the question.

176
00:11:49,138 --> 00:11:50,938
I'd say that so far,

177
00:11:52,158 --> 00:11:54,659
one thing that we haven't implemented fully yet,

178
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,000
and I won't be responsible for large parts of the core,

179
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,500
most of the code, because I can't do networking stuff,

180
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:00,960
but the...

181
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,671
the level editor is going to have a level sharing functionality,

182
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,711
you will be able to share levels with others.

183
00:12:07,652 --> 00:12:12,373
And I'm pretty sure that there will be some things related to that

184
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:14,374
that will turn out to be surprisingly tricky,

185
00:12:14,474 --> 00:12:20,756
like how to handle which levels to show first and so on.

186
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:23,817
But that's not my concern, kind of,

187
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:27,899
so I guess I should say about the things I myself implemented.

188
00:12:28,859 --> 00:12:30,800
And from those, I'd say that the...

189
00:12:34,524 --> 00:12:40,546
When I made the level editor for the game originally, the one that I used personally to kind of make the game,

190
00:12:42,226 --> 00:12:47,148
I had only a fairly limited amount of things I could put in a level.

191
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:54,631
Like, in this level you can see there's Algae, Algae, Algae, how do you pronounce it? I don't know.

192
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:55,892
There's Baba, sorry?

193
00:12:56,851 --> 00:12:57,131
Algae.

194
00:12:57,871 --> 00:12:58,512
Algae, thank you.

195
00:12:58,932 --> 00:13:03,295
So there's some tiles, there's some brickwork, there's some walls, a flag, blah blah.

196
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:08,879
There were a limited amount of those, a limited amount of words, so I could just do a huge

197
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:13,582
list of everything and when you press tab in the editor it just shows you almost everything

198
00:13:13,662 --> 00:13:16,804
and you can pick from there and do some adjustments if needed.

199
00:13:17,444 --> 00:13:24,549
But for the final editor there will be too many things to really show just as a single

200
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:25,670
list it would be really.

201
00:13:26,376 --> 00:13:31,299
confusing to use if the player had to kind of browse a huge list every time they want to add something.

202
00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:32,900
Do you want a hint?

203
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:35,781
Yeah, take it, Brian.

204
00:13:37,362 --> 00:13:44,046
Hmm, so you beat a level when something that is you touches something that is win.

205
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:46,968
Yes.

206
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:50,550
So... Yes.

207
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,031
I will go with that.

208
00:13:54,072 --> 00:13:55,373
Hehehehe, okay.

209
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:56,948
Congratulations!

210
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:11,872
So, for the final version of the editor, I had to implement a system where you kind of have a palette or a selection of objects you can pick from to add to the level.

211
00:14:12,312 --> 00:14:15,353
And then you can add and remove objects from that list.

212
00:14:15,513 --> 00:14:22,314
So you have kind of like a level-specific palette of objects, and then you have the full list.

213
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:28,948
have to be able to interact with those and there has to be like a search functionality and tag functionality

214
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,808
so you can easily find the things you want to find.

215
00:14:31,769 --> 00:14:34,789
And implementing that system has been

216
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:40,291
not as terrible as I assumed it could be,

217
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:45,992
but I've been streaming Developing Baba Is You pretty frequently this year

218
00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:51,013
and during the last stream I definitely felt pretty exhausted

219
00:14:51,694 --> 00:14:53,194
at the end of the stream when I kind of...

220
00:14:54,088 --> 00:15:03,496
managed to optimize a system for finding certain objects and displaying their icons in the editor,

221
00:15:03,556 --> 00:15:10,282
so it's a fairly complicated thing. It's also kind of probably pretty uninteresting sounding

222
00:15:10,302 --> 00:15:15,606
because it's such a kind of like a technical thing, but to answer honestly that would be my answer.

223
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,860
I think you should be very technical and detailed. Like, most people watching this are going to be game developers themselves.

224
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,061
Or just type-writing fans of the game. We got some folks like Kyron Gliff who dropped in the chat saying,

225
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:32,282
Hey, I'm poorly, and Nick's Mad Science thinks it's cool to see Bala getting a GDC shoutout.

226
00:15:32,643 --> 00:15:36,783
Man, Nick, you got that backwards. It's cool that he came on to our stream.

227
00:15:37,384 --> 00:15:37,784
That's right.

228
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,884
It's very kind of you to invite me, as mentioned.

229
00:15:41,765 --> 00:15:42,425
Super nice to...

230
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,653
be able to see people play the game and say words about it as well.

231
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:49,216
Alex, I'm going to toss the question ball to you.

232
00:15:50,057 --> 00:15:52,619
Oh, yeah, we've covered a couple of things I wanted to dig into deeper.

233
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:53,700
Let's just pick one at random.

234
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,521
Tell me a bit about

235
00:15:55,882 --> 00:15:58,104
puzzle game design, because, you know, I've been keeping track of your work.

236
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:01,387
Folks who don't know, you've made, I think, dozens of games, right?

237
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:02,728
They're on your website. This is sort of.

238
00:16:03,547 --> 00:16:06,787
the one that has gotten a lot of attention recently, but you're working on some other

239
00:16:06,807 --> 00:16:07,328
stuff as well.

240
00:16:07,388 --> 00:16:12,329
And I think your last project and your next project are sort of a more Metroidvania type

241
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:12,629
game.

242
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:19,831
So I'm so curious, what do you appreciate about puzzle game design and what is challenging

243
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:22,312
about it that you are dealing with right now?

244
00:16:22,352 --> 00:16:26,373
Because I imagine laying out these levels must be brain breaking.

245
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:30,954
Well, for the things you said earlier...

246
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:35,861
I think I counted all the games I've made, if we also count like very small jam games,

247
00:16:35,941 --> 00:16:41,904
and I think there was like 45 or so that I've made over the past 12 years, I think.

248
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:42,665
Yeah.

249
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:48,749
But yeah, most of them are just like, I made this in one hour because I was young and decided

250
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:50,250
that making a game in one hour is fun.

251
00:16:52,163 --> 00:16:57,487
And yeah, the game that I'm working on currently is a sequel to my first commercial title, and yeah, it's a Metroidvania.

252
00:16:57,727 --> 00:17:02,411
I kind of promised people that I would make a sequel, and it's fun to make a Metroidvania,

253
00:17:03,271 --> 00:17:05,393
even though I've been more in the puzzle world lately.

254
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:13,599
But yeah, for puzzle games, I think the thing that I like most in puzzle games and puzzle game design

255
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:19,683
is that when I make games, I usually strive for...

256
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:25,019
making something surprising or amazing.

257
00:17:25,239 --> 00:17:28,440
I haven't really found the good words in English,

258
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,822
but the idea is that, to best express what I mean,

259
00:17:32,902 --> 00:17:37,444
is that for me, it's a lot of fun if I see someone play my game

260
00:17:38,044 --> 00:17:40,846
and the game does something that catches them by surprise

261
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:45,307
in a good way so that they maybe burst out laughing in surprise.

262
00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:48,769
Like, whoa, the game did this kind of a thing? What?

263
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:49,409
That kind of...

264
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:54,175
experience is what I live for when making games.

265
00:17:55,035 --> 00:18:00,337
Metroidvanias are nice for that because they can have secrets and boss fights and that

266
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:05,319
kind of thing, but I think puzzle games are even more suited for that because they can

267
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:15,963
have like meta puzzles, they can have things where some simple idea is iterated in some

268
00:18:16,003 --> 00:18:18,204
way that the player doesn't expect at all.

269
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:23,051
And in Ba Ba Is You I kind of try to make every level, or as many levels as possible,

270
00:18:23,992 --> 00:18:31,413
do something new so that I would kind of maximize the amount of these kinds of surprising moments, surprising twists.

271
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:36,675
That is something that I learned from the Stephen Sausage Roll and the Snake Bird games.

272
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:46,277
Those games both kind of do a really good job at requiring you to do something at least slightly unique.

273
00:18:47,554 --> 00:18:53,338
in every level and that is something I kind of strove for and that I find

274
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:57,000
enjoying enjoyable when I play puzzle games myself and I'm actually kind of

275
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:01,083
trying to always trying to find more puzzle games that follow a similar

276
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:06,406
system. This actually just to pause for a moment and talk about the game being

277
00:19:06,466 --> 00:19:11,410
played here. So it's actually a very good kind of non-tutorial moment that I

278
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,073
should have maybe tutorialized better which is that there are these

279
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:18,009
two new words, open and shut.

280
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,710
And what those words do literally, spoiler alert,

281
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,471
is that if something is shut,

282
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:25,791
if it touches something that is open,

283
00:19:25,971 --> 00:19:27,572
they destroy each other.

284
00:19:27,812 --> 00:19:29,352
And saying like, if something is open,

285
00:19:29,512 --> 00:19:32,233
if a door is open and it touches a key that is shut,

286
00:19:32,673 --> 00:19:33,713
they destroy each other.

287
00:19:34,454 --> 00:19:36,774
But obviously, for a very obvious reason,

288
00:19:36,994 --> 00:19:38,875
if the game says door is shut,

289
00:19:39,335 --> 00:19:43,216
people assume that the door is like a solid object,

290
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:44,256
that you cannot move through it.

291
00:19:44,756 --> 00:19:46,117
But that is not actually true.

292
00:19:46,654 --> 00:19:54,084
And the reason why breaking the rule, door is shut, didn't let you pass through the door is because there is also a door is stop at the top.

293
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:57,508
And that level causes a lot of trouble.

294
00:19:57,969 --> 00:20:02,775
And I feel that it's kind of a, at least to some extent, it's a failure from my kind of tutorializing.

295
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:04,428
I just kind of wanted to point it out.

296
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,890
That's interesting because from a subconscious perspective, my brain was already tracking

297
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,131
towards if I change what the door is, I can get through the door.

298
00:20:10,311 --> 00:20:11,391
Sorry, Alex, I jumped on you there.

299
00:20:11,731 --> 00:20:13,532
No, not at all.

300
00:20:13,732 --> 00:20:17,114
And that's it's interesting to hear you describe that problem, because I did sense it as I

301
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:21,256
ran through it, because I got confused why killing doors stopped didn't do anything.

302
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:25,798
But then it just sort of thankfully my brain just subverted or moved to the next problem

303
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:28,679
solving technique, which, you know, like I was testing a hypothesis, right?

304
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,481
Like this game is very hypothesis. If I try this, then this will happen.

305
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:41,846
and thankfully that just let me try something different. Nope, wall is defeat. God damn it.

306
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:45,908
Yeah, someone pointed, like a player pointed out at some point that I should have made the word

307
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:54,352
open should be unlock and shut should be locked and I agree. It would be maybe a bit more

308
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:56,673
informative or like more intuitive.

309
00:20:58,506 --> 00:21:02,354
There's actually a pretty interesting story, I'm getting sidetracked, but there's the word

310
00:21:02,555 --> 00:21:07,686
DEFEAT, and in the original game jam version of the game, the word was actually KILLED.

311
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:13,133
But because the game is so cutesy, and I also kinda, despite developing a Metroidvania,

312
00:21:13,193 --> 00:21:18,595
I generally prefer having, like, non-violence in my games.

313
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:22,135
I try to find and figure out solutions that are less violent if possible.

314
00:21:22,515 --> 00:21:27,117
So I felt kill was a very violent word, especially, like, if you see, here's Baba.

315
00:21:27,257 --> 00:21:29,237
Baba is killed. That's brutal.

316
00:21:30,097 --> 00:21:34,078
And I spent, in the end, I think like a half a year

317
00:21:35,178 --> 00:21:37,999
trying to figure out what to change the word kill to.

318
00:21:38,943 --> 00:21:43,945
And because the idea is that kill only destroys something that is you.

319
00:21:44,165 --> 00:21:46,266
It doesn't harm anything else but you.

320
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:50,567
So the idea is that it's harmful to living things, so to say.

321
00:21:51,448 --> 00:21:54,869
And kill conveys that idea really well.

322
00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:59,971
And I think, like, after trying many ideas and getting suggestions from people,

323
00:22:00,391 --> 00:22:03,552
defeat was the, like, next best answer.

324
00:22:03,692 --> 00:22:05,732
There was, like, gone and poof and...

325
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:11,184
I don't remember the others, but there were several suggestions we went through.

326
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,406
It was an interesting problem.

327
00:22:13,486 --> 00:22:15,708
I'm gonna ask a question based on what's going on right here.

328
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,711
Folks in chat, we are going to get to your questions.

329
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:21,033
Thank you for hanging out and chatting already.

330
00:22:21,434 --> 00:22:22,234
I do want to give you guys...

331
00:22:23,496 --> 00:22:27,159
I'm faced with a decision right now to either keep clearing out the levels in here,

332
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:27,559
and I...

333
00:22:30,122 --> 00:22:33,246
Or I have the decision to move on to the next area

334
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:39,275
Which is loading going back up to the map. I don't know why it loaded this for some reason

335
00:22:39,295 --> 00:22:41,438
I don't know why that oh because I'm using the wrong controller

336
00:22:44,121 --> 00:22:45,443
Or I missed so

337
00:22:47,881 --> 00:22:54,002
What I would like to know is what was your mindset behind creating these scenarios where players

338
00:22:55,122 --> 00:22:59,783
could either finish an area and then move on versus like giving them the opportunity to

339
00:23:00,283 --> 00:23:03,304
move here. I'm going to go ahead and move on to the next area just so we have some variety on

340
00:23:03,344 --> 00:23:07,025
the stream and I'm curious what your thought process was behind that as a game designer.

341
00:23:08,425 --> 00:23:12,086
Before you go I would suggest playing one more level in the previous area.

342
00:23:12,126 --> 00:23:14,946
That's what I was worried about because I was worried that if I skip something I wouldn't learn.

343
00:23:15,803 --> 00:23:19,444
If you play level 9, this explains a thing that could be helpful.

344
00:23:19,504 --> 00:23:21,484
But if that's the case, why did you let me do that?

345
00:23:21,504 --> 00:23:23,885
Why would you let me advance here without learning something useful here?

346
00:23:24,205 --> 00:23:27,086
I guess in this specific case it's an oversight from my part.

347
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,967
But the reason...

348
00:23:31,167 --> 00:23:32,007
The kind of...

349
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:39,549
If we discount this specific situation where something that would be useful

350
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:44,131
is maybe not taught by the game if you skip these levels...

351
00:23:46,035 --> 00:23:53,541
I wanted to make it so that you always have as many options as possible for kind of progressing

352
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:58,425
because in a puzzle game it's very easy to get mentally stuck.

353
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:06,932
And kind of if you only have one option for a puzzle if you get stuck in that puzzle it might

354
00:24:06,972 --> 00:24:14,598
be that you kind of you won't get anywhere because you are stuck trying a single idea.

355
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:20,334
over and over and not kind of refreshing your mind. You need to take a break to kind of refresh

356
00:24:20,374 --> 00:24:29,778
your concept on what you are doing and the offering the players multiple options to pick from

357
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:35,701
I feel is nicer because if they get stuck in one puzzle they still can do something in the game.

358
00:24:35,741 --> 00:24:41,124
They don't have to close the game and wait until they get the insight. They can go to other level

359
00:24:41,364 --> 00:24:42,465
which might be easier for them.

360
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:49,919
Another reason is that in Baba Is You I felt that it would be best if the levels were grouped

361
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:56,205
by the words used in them instead of by, like, purely by difficulty.

362
00:24:56,285 --> 00:25:01,609
Obviously there needs to be, like, a difficulty curve, but especially because some of the

363
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:06,313
specific words are very... odd, so to say.

364
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,995
Like, very complex, very specific.

365
00:25:11,163 --> 00:25:15,766
I felt that it would be nicer if the player doesn't have to learn so many words at once,

366
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:19,848
but instead different areas would have different words.

367
00:25:20,488 --> 00:25:28,672
And if I group the levels using that criteria, there will inevitably be levels that are easier

368
00:25:29,713 --> 00:25:33,014
in one area than there were some levels in the earlier areas.

369
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:37,476
Like if I introduce a new word entirely, a new concept.

370
00:25:38,376 --> 00:25:41,920
I need to make an easy level that tutorializes that concept.

371
00:25:42,762 --> 00:25:49,551
And so I thought it would be odd if the player kind of expects...

372
00:25:51,647 --> 00:25:57,148
an even difficulty curve and then gets into a new area and they're like, hey, this is a super easy level.

373
00:25:57,668 --> 00:26:05,290
So I decided to go with the concept that every area kind of resets the difficulty curve at least a little bit, like pushes it back.

374
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:10,891
So in every area you can start from the easy levels, you can beat the easy levels and move on,

375
00:26:11,531 --> 00:26:18,913
but if you want you can keep going for the harder levels that like really explore the limits of the words introduced in those worlds.

376
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:31,518
And this is partially also related to how, because I knew that the game would be possibly pretty difficult.

377
00:26:31,819 --> 00:26:38,644
It's very hard to estimate as a game developer how difficult a game is by yourself,

378
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:40,925
but I assumed that the game would be pretty difficult.

379
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:46,089
But I knew that there would be people who like to play these kinds of games.

380
00:26:46,615 --> 00:26:52,920
or them there that would like to see like BABA in action, even if they don't enjoy playing super hard puzzle games.

381
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:59,886
I wanted to have a system where they, or actually a tester suggested having a system for kind of opting out

382
00:27:00,526 --> 00:27:07,132
once you have seen enough, so that people who want to see the system but don't want to get super hardcore on it,

383
00:27:07,912 --> 00:27:08,593
they can play the game.

384
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:13,747
they get offered some, like, hey, if you beat this level, you can say that you beat the game

385
00:27:14,368 --> 00:27:18,028
and you can move on, you don't have to get stressed and annoyed about the difficulty.

386
00:27:18,528 --> 00:27:23,909
So, the game is now structured so that you only need to beat, I think, about 30 levels

387
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,050
to get access to the final level.

388
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,871
There's still more to do, there are plenty more levels after that,

389
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:35,091
but you can still, like, you can complete the game technically at a very early stage,

390
00:27:35,231 --> 00:27:39,112
and that's also related to this kind of map structuring.

391
00:27:40,302 --> 00:27:46,705
Nice. I'm gonna go ahead and grab a good question here from chat because there have been so many.

392
00:27:46,845 --> 00:27:51,067
Ryder Blox wants to know what inspired the cutesy design of the game? They love Baba's design.

393
00:27:51,467 --> 00:27:58,450
So how did you come up with this unique aesthetic? Yeah, so at the Game Jam you have, or I had,

394
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:08,095
only 48 hours to make everything. So my go-to method has been to use the default Windows Palette,

395
00:28:08,215 --> 00:28:08,735
like the old.

396
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,463
Windows 98 Palette with fully saturated everything.

397
00:28:14,243 --> 00:28:19,087
I actually kind of like that palette nowadays because I've used it so many times and I've been corrupted by it.

398
00:28:19,988 --> 00:28:24,091
And in Baba is You everything was static.

399
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:28,294
They were just like moving pictures on the screen.

400
00:28:29,014 --> 00:28:33,578
And when I started working on the full game, I spent some time worrying that

401
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:38,522
maybe I should make the graphical style very kind of

402
00:28:38,793 --> 00:28:44,556
appealing to the masses, so to say, to kind of put it in a kind of a condescending way.

403
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:51,639
I wondered if I should go for 3D art. If I went for 3D art, I would have to learn a new tool,

404
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,521
because the tool I used to make Baba Is You cannot do 3D art. So I was kind of conflicted

405
00:28:56,561 --> 00:29:03,384
about this kind of, maybe I should spend the extra effort to make the game really appealing,

406
00:29:04,045 --> 00:29:08,067
and then spend more time having to learn the tools to make it.

407
00:29:09,886 --> 00:29:17,508
get it finished or maybe I should go with a style that I can already do and accept that the game will

408
00:29:18,108 --> 00:29:24,550
probably be a bit less interesting looking or a lot less interesting looking. And the final decision

409
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:31,192
for this specific style came from two sources. First was that I had played the game Crayon Physics

410
00:29:31,272 --> 00:29:37,134
Deluxe by Petri Purho in 2008. It won the Sumas McNally Grand Prize in 2008.

411
00:29:39,604 --> 00:29:46,429
And it had a really nice, this like, crayony style where things had this kind of slight animation, slight wobble all the time.

412
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:51,372
And as a young game developer, I actually made clones of that game.

413
00:29:51,973 --> 00:29:55,656
Petri likes to mention it from time to time when we meet.

414
00:29:56,857 --> 00:30:04,863
But I got really attached to this kind of wobbly style, and I also used it in some non-clone ideas later on that kind of a similar...

415
00:30:06,042 --> 00:30:11,384
Idea where I draw every animation frame several times to get this kind of slight wobble to everything

416
00:30:12,004 --> 00:30:19,065
So I already knew that that that style works and the other inspiration came from a fellow developer

417
00:30:20,226 --> 00:30:29,268
Jason Boyer who has actually just recently released the Kickstarter for their new game like a mecha dating game, right?

418
00:30:29,548 --> 00:30:32,709
I'm so sorry. I don't remember the exact right now. Don't feel bad about it. Yeah

419
00:30:35,498 --> 00:30:43,563
They made a stream playing Baba Is You with their friends pretty quickly after I released the original Game Jam version on itch.io.

420
00:30:43,623 --> 00:30:49,267
The game is actually still available for freeware on itch.io if you want to see the very original version of it.

421
00:30:50,328 --> 00:31:01,955
And for the stream they made, or video, they made a piece of fanart where they interpreted Baba as a cute, bipedal goat person.

422
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,836
In the original sprites...

423
00:31:04,303 --> 00:31:06,424
I had intended Baba to be a robot.

424
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,645
They had like a tiny antennae,

425
00:31:09,185 --> 00:31:11,045
and they were like bipedal robots,

426
00:31:11,506 --> 00:31:14,547
but Jason interpreted those antennae as horns.

427
00:31:15,627 --> 00:31:18,348
And to be honest, I really liked that design.

428
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:22,169
A robot is kind of clinical, often, not always,

429
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:23,869
but often kind of boring.

430
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:27,170
It's a very easy, this kind of non-personal,

431
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,432
abstract main character option for hacks like me

432
00:31:31,532 --> 00:31:33,492
who don't know how to do interesting looking robots.

433
00:31:34,246 --> 00:31:40,710
So after seeing Jason's fan art and kind of pondering where I should go with the visual style,

434
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:48,034
I realized that, okay, maybe actually if I use this wobbly style that I'm comfortable with using

435
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:54,878
and I know how it works, and if I do like a cutesy style, I think it would really work really well

436
00:31:55,438 --> 00:32:00,561
with the game. Also because Baba Is You, like many people told me after the game jam that Baba Is You

437
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:02,102
contains in their eyes some kind of...

438
00:32:02,582 --> 00:32:10,624
interesting philosophical concepts. You can consider the word you to be like the consciousness

439
00:32:11,004 --> 00:32:17,505
and the consciousness moves through objects. Many different things can be conscious and they have

440
00:32:17,525 --> 00:32:21,626
their own agency when they are conscious but they can be only conscious one at a time. This kind of

441
00:32:21,646 --> 00:32:26,947
thing. And I thought it would be a kind of a funny juxtaposition if some people could see these kind

442
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:31,108
of deep themes or kind of morbid themes in Baba-Yazoo.

443
00:32:31,878 --> 00:32:38,383
But at the same time, the game would have this very harmless visual style going on.

444
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:38,983
I love that.

445
00:32:39,244 --> 00:32:44,267
Yeah, I had not thought about it at all, about how this game reflects the notion of consciousness

446
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:45,528
as transitory.

447
00:32:45,608 --> 00:32:47,289
That's, ah, wow, that's good.

448
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:51,913
Yeah, there's a Buddhism going on, if you look into it.

449
00:32:53,924 --> 00:32:55,265
You made a good video game.

450
00:32:55,305 --> 00:32:56,145
There's a question here.

451
00:32:56,165 --> 00:32:58,647
I have more questions, but there's another one here in chat that I want to get to.

452
00:32:58,687 --> 00:32:59,547
It's a good follow up.

453
00:32:59,607 --> 00:33:01,368
It's forgive me if I butcher this.

454
00:33:01,428 --> 00:33:02,108
It's it's me.

455
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:03,569
Avinash asked.

456
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:04,410
They have a technical question.

457
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,190
They want to know, how did you learn to code games?

458
00:33:06,631 --> 00:33:09,952
They know a little bit of Python and C++, but engines like Unity

459
00:33:10,433 --> 00:33:11,753
seem very difficult to learn.

460
00:33:11,773 --> 00:33:15,835
Yeah, this is a kind of a

461
00:33:16,716 --> 00:33:18,137
embarrassing question in a way.

462
00:33:18,217 --> 00:33:19,077
Not really, but.

463
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:22,879
Oh, do go on.

464
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:27,992
I was just wondering if I should ask if a hint is needed, but I guess not.

465
00:33:28,412 --> 00:33:30,934
No, no, no, no.

466
00:33:30,954 --> 00:33:32,235
We're not here to win. We're here to play.

467
00:33:32,996 --> 00:33:40,041
Yeah, so Baba Is You was made mostly, or like the base engine, is a game creation tool,

468
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:44,724
kind of like Game Maker, but not exactly Game Maker, called Multimedia Fusion 2 by Clickteam.

469
00:33:46,306 --> 00:33:52,170
It's a fairly old program. There are newer versions, but I use an older version because I'm old school.

470
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:52,931
And...

471
00:33:54,049 --> 00:34:00,171
Multimedia Fusion and its predecessors were actually the kind of one of the first graphical

472
00:34:00,451 --> 00:34:04,272
no coding experience needed game creation tools in the market.

473
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,573
The first version was released in 1994.

474
00:34:07,873 --> 00:34:10,994
So it's a pretty old, old family of tools.

475
00:34:11,794 --> 00:34:16,475
And they used to be very popular, but then programs such as Game Maker and Construct

476
00:34:16,535 --> 00:34:21,957
kind of advanced so far that Multimedia Fusion and Clickteam Fusion, it's a follower.

477
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:28,041
have been a bit less... they're not as common nowadays that they used to be like 10 years ago or so.

478
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:34,646
And I was in primary school, a schoolmate asked me if I wanted to make games. I super wanted to

479
00:34:34,686 --> 00:34:39,970
make games. I had played Super Mario World on my cousin's Super Nintendo and I really wanted to

480
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:44,534
make games. I had also drawn video games in kindergarten on paper. I wanted to make games.

481
00:34:44,994 --> 00:34:57,259
So, Schoolmate introduced GameMaker to me. I think GameMaker was in version 4 or something at that point in those early times, like 2002 or something like that.

482
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:03,522
And we started making games, we made like a Space Innovator with Pac-Man in GameMaker, stuff like that.

483
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:07,964
But GameMaker has its own scripting language, the GML.

484
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:15,009
And because I was in primary school, I didn't understand English very well and I didn't have very much patience.

485
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:24,217
So learning a scripting language was way beyond me, apart from like simple copying code from examples that wasn't really satisfactory.

486
00:35:25,118 --> 00:35:36,688
So eventually another schoolmate introduced the program called The Games Factory to me, which is basically the predecessor of Multimedia Fusion.

487
00:35:37,341 --> 00:35:41,622
And that one didn't require any coding. There was no scripting at all. It was purely graphical.

488
00:35:42,023 --> 00:35:45,384
And that was perfect for me, because even if I didn't understand what something meant,

489
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:49,425
I could trial and error my way through it. So that's how I started.

490
00:35:49,965 --> 00:35:57,348
And there was actually a boom of pre-teen kids making their own games in the Games Factory,

491
00:35:57,428 --> 00:36:04,490
in Finland specifically, in early... how do you say, in the early 2000s.

492
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:05,150
Right.

493
00:36:05,991 --> 00:36:06,571
And I kind of...

494
00:36:07,297 --> 00:36:14,883
Yeah, I followed that boom even though I didn't have my own website and I was too young to put my games online or even to finish anything.

495
00:36:15,743 --> 00:36:32,295
And then in 2016, after using Multimedia Fusion for like 8 years happily, without knowing any programming, I tried to get into Unity, I tried to get into ActionScript, I tried to get into some other languages, but they always felt too intimidating.

496
00:36:32,917 --> 00:36:38,039
A good friend of mine, Lukas Meller, who has taught me a lot of things about game development and programming,

497
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:46,644
told me that there's a plugin for Multimedia Fusion 2 that lets me use the Lua scripting language.

498
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:53,467
And they basically taught me, they made me tutorials for how to use Lua in general,

499
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:56,229
and also how to use Lua in Multimedia Fusion specifically.

500
00:36:56,789 --> 00:37:00,111
And then, I guess the time was right, I was old enough.

501
00:37:00,757 --> 00:37:08,481
At that point I kind of understood English a little bit, at the ripe age of like 23 or something, 24.

502
00:37:10,081 --> 00:37:12,562
And, uh, congratulations, nice.

503
00:37:12,923 --> 00:37:13,663
Thank you.

504
00:37:15,164 --> 00:37:23,427
And, um, so I got really quickly into Lua, and one year passed, and I got the idea for Baba is You,

505
00:37:23,607 --> 00:37:27,769
and, like, Lua has been very integral for the process.

506
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:30,470
So right now I just make games by using this.

507
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,543
engine from 2006 combined with Lua.

508
00:37:35,624 --> 00:37:39,307
Nice, it's classics. Real quick, I'm just curious

509
00:37:40,688 --> 00:37:45,291
what is not having English as your first language like when you're trying to

510
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:49,275
be a successful international game developer? I mean that's a specific

511
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:52,717
example of how you sort of found it difficult to use the tools until

512
00:37:52,737 --> 00:37:55,440
you were at a higher proficiency with the language, but in any other way, like

513
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:55,940
has it been...

514
00:37:58,281 --> 00:38:02,224
Has it been challenging or in any way interesting to try and overcome those barriers?

515
00:38:04,706 --> 00:38:11,551
Not really, because in Finland most kids of my generation learned English really quickly

516
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:18,376
because it was the time of MSN Messenger and internet forums and so on. So a lot of kids,

517
00:38:18,456 --> 00:38:22,278
even those who were not interested in making games or even playing games,

518
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:27,758
learned English at a very young age. Also Finland doesn't have the kind of

519
00:38:28,918 --> 00:38:34,502
dubbing as much. We use more subtitles on TV so many kids learn English by watching movies,

520
00:38:34,902 --> 00:38:40,746
a subtitle and so on. So it was never really a problem. I've looked at some of my earliest

521
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:46,649
posts on some internet forums from like from like 2006 and yeah there they are.

522
00:38:47,919 --> 00:38:51,642
they are filled with XD and typos and some interesting...

523
00:38:51,923 --> 00:38:53,624
There's actually a very nice anecdote where

524
00:38:54,285 --> 00:38:58,248
using English was really cool, obviously, even before I could understand English, but like, just like

525
00:38:58,568 --> 00:39:03,232
when you don't speak English, it's always slightly cooler to use a different language than your own.

526
00:39:03,772 --> 00:39:04,853
And I tried to make like a...

527
00:39:06,274 --> 00:39:10,938
game where you're a soldier fighting against aliens, and you go into missions to kind of...

528
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,181
just to kill aliens, basically.

529
00:39:14,687 --> 00:39:23,249
And the first mission was such that you are in a like a anti-air artillery bunker and you need to eradicate all the aliens there.

530
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:32,771
And I had tried to write that like mission explanation without knowing much English.

531
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:35,912
And the final sentence that came into the game was,

532
00:39:36,672 --> 00:39:42,253
wash the fly bunker for aliens. And it wasn't really...

533
00:39:44,245 --> 00:39:45,286
I mean, I didn't know.

534
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:53,453
I got I got some words like some of the grammar makes sense. So it wasn't total failure, but it didn't really convey the

535
00:39:54,253 --> 00:39:54,874
correct idea

536
00:39:55,654 --> 00:39:58,497
Right on. Yeah. I mean I I only ask because I specifically

537
00:39:58,517 --> 00:40:01,379
I have never even though I probably should have heard this more often

538
00:40:01,755 --> 00:40:06,719
I have never heard a game designer mention English language proficiency as part of one

539
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:12,123
of the hurdles to adopting a new programming language or learning the more complex nature

540
00:40:12,163 --> 00:40:12,904
of a language.

541
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:17,528
So that's just something I never really thought about at all, is sort of another aspect of

542
00:40:17,568 --> 00:40:20,870
privilege that comes with that language, is so many of them are written by default in

543
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:21,190
English.

544
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:26,755
Yeah, it's definitely like, definitely when I was in primary school, it kind of slowed

545
00:40:26,775 --> 00:40:27,375
the process.

546
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:32,951
and it might be that if I had understood English natively I would have been able to get into

547
00:40:33,692 --> 00:40:39,394
actual programming languages instead of game creation tools but who can say what would have

548
00:40:39,414 --> 00:40:45,096
happened so it's it well I didn't really consider it a huge problem and it's actually a huge perk

549
00:40:45,337 --> 00:40:51,539
that English words look cooler because it's very way easier to give like fantasy names to things

550
00:40:51,979 --> 00:40:55,681
like there's the Super Nintendo game F-Zero where one of the

551
00:40:56,152 --> 00:41:03,173
ships or the racing things is called wild goose or wild geese or something like that.

552
00:41:03,633 --> 00:41:09,455
And as a kid I didn't understand what a goose is and I was like oh this is some cool sci-fi name.

553
00:41:09,515 --> 00:41:17,776
It's like a super monster and then when I realized oh it's a bird it was like if I would have called

554
00:41:17,856 --> 00:41:23,498
it uh villihanhi in Finnish it would have been...

555
00:41:25,006 --> 00:41:26,846
That must have made Top Gun really weird.

556
00:41:28,707 --> 00:41:32,829
Yeah, it's a scary bird. I mean, I live across the street from a bird habitat and geese will

557
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:37,471
mess you up. I mean, wild goose is not... isn't intimidating. Anyway.

558
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:43,053
I didn't know that then. I think everyone has learned about geese over the past year.

559
00:41:43,954 --> 00:41:48,215
Right, yeah. Nix Mad Science in chat calls out Untitled Goose Game as the new harbinger of the

560
00:41:49,036 --> 00:41:50,336
goose future.

561
00:41:53,272 --> 00:41:58,873
Yeah, there's more, actually there's maybe not, there's one small question in chat maybe we can

562
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:02,514
just clear up from Nixman Science, they just wanted to check in and verify, when we were

563
00:42:02,534 --> 00:42:07,855
talking about Lua and Fusion interacting, do the Lua fuels, pardon me, do the Lua files,

564
00:42:07,915 --> 00:42:11,656
does Lua kind of dictate what happens in-engine or is there any greater

565
00:42:11,676 --> 00:42:19,798
tie there between the two tools? That's a very interesting and possibly

566
00:42:20,118 --> 00:42:22,719
difficult question to answer. Yeah. Well...

567
00:42:23,292 --> 00:42:34,119
But in Babaisju specifically, multimedia fusion mostly handles anything that is kind of graphical

568
00:42:34,279 --> 00:42:41,744
in some way and also some things that are just more intuitive for me to make using multimedia

569
00:42:41,784 --> 00:42:50,609
fusion syntax. For example, if I need to attach an object to another object for whatever reason,

570
00:42:51,515 --> 00:42:55,936
there are some situations. For example, if there's a button and the button needs to have

571
00:42:56,016 --> 00:43:01,157
text that is kind of stuck in the button, that is easier for me to do using MultimediaFusion

572
00:43:01,177 --> 00:43:06,398
than Lua because MultimediaFusion handles things like destroying objects and creating

573
00:43:06,438 --> 00:43:15,860
new objects. But for the most part, the actual rule changing logic is in Lua. And the plugin

574
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:21,322
that allows me to use Lua functionality in MultimediaFusion.

575
00:43:21,818 --> 00:43:26,821
has some really nice tools. For example, because Multimedia Fusion is an object-based language

576
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:31,503
and all the things you see on the screen are just objects, that kind of animations and things

577
00:43:31,544 --> 00:43:39,128
happening to them, so the plugin allows me to kind of add objects from Multimedia Fusion to Lua, so

578
00:43:39,648 --> 00:43:45,432
they kind of become entities in the Lua, so I can just refer to them and change their values

579
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:50,655
directly in Lua instead of having to do some kind of like a here so

580
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:56,430
Lua function that calls Multimedia Fusion to do something to the object and return something back.

581
00:43:56,850 --> 00:44:02,351
And instead I can just do all of that directly in Lua and it's been extremely helpful,

582
00:44:03,172 --> 00:44:09,073
except for the part where the plugin, sorry, where the plugin's developer stopped working on it at

583
00:44:09,173 --> 00:44:17,075
one point and there's a memory leak related to that specific functionality. So if you play

584
00:44:17,648 --> 00:44:21,710
the multimedia fusion version of the game for long enough, it will crash.

585
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,611
But apart from that, it was very powerful and useful.

586
00:44:25,812 --> 00:44:27,273
Yeah. Thanks for thanks for getting into that.

587
00:44:27,293 --> 00:44:31,315
I know it can be tricky sometimes to explain in a cogent way

588
00:44:31,715 --> 00:44:34,996
the weird ways that tech tools and, you know, programming languages

589
00:44:35,016 --> 00:44:36,377
have all kind of hinged together.

590
00:44:36,417 --> 00:44:39,218
But that's that's kind of what we're about here. So I appreciate it.

591
00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:44,360
Uh, yeah, no, this is, uh, let's, I kind of want to, as we get to the end of our hour here, and

592
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,863
please, we got about 15 more minutes left, so if you do have any burning questions, get them out now.

593
00:44:48,563 --> 00:44:52,326
Um, I kind of want to know how you're feeling now that the game's out and released. I mean,

594
00:44:52,346 --> 00:44:56,629
you're working on meaningful updates and a new project, uh, and you're up for a new slate of

595
00:44:56,649 --> 00:45:03,113
awards, uh, next month. Um, how are you feeling? Like, how has this game changed your career as a

596
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:07,556
game developer, and what's different now, uh, the Baba is you is out and in the world?

597
00:45:11,265 --> 00:45:17,929
I get more emails. After the release of Baba is You, I recently counted and I've like

598
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:26,976
personally answered to well over 1300 emails on my own. Don't do that.

599
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:32,620
No. It's not a good idea to answer that many emails. You should preserve yourself from that.

600
00:45:34,181 --> 00:45:35,502
But um...

601
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:43,146
Yeah, Baba's success has definitely enabled me to be more relaxed about my future things.

602
00:45:43,446 --> 00:45:56,136
I can be in a situation where I can plan my life so that I can actually kind of have working

603
00:45:56,196 --> 00:45:56,597
hours.

604
00:45:56,817 --> 00:46:02,622
I can try to make it so that I get enough exercise and I can like, I just have more

605
00:46:02,882 --> 00:46:04,723
ability to plan.

606
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:13,119
what to do with my life so that I live a healthy life instead of having to worry as much about like

607
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:21,663
everything burning down on me, like ending up bankrupt or something. It kind of

608
00:46:23,023 --> 00:46:31,567
it kind of simultaneously gives me that kind of peace of mind but partially related to those emails.

609
00:46:32,097 --> 00:46:38,122
It does also make everything more stressful because it also means that there are more eyes on what I do.

610
00:46:38,603 --> 00:46:43,066
It hasn't... that part of it hasn't really manifested in the way it could have.

611
00:46:43,206 --> 00:46:52,274
Like I could imagine there being some really awkward situations and there might be in the future,

612
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:57,278
like if someone gets really invested in Baba and expects me to do something and gets angry

613
00:46:57,298 --> 00:47:01,201
when I don't do that and that kind of stuff. I'm very neurotic so I'm very good at imagining.

614
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:07,892
those kinds of things happening, but that kind of stuff hasn't really happened, but it's still like the idea that okay

615
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:12,354
Those are now more of a possibility than they would have been

616
00:47:12,974 --> 00:47:14,475
earlier is

617
00:47:14,975 --> 00:47:15,595
sometimes

618
00:47:16,556 --> 00:47:17,916
sometimes stressful

619
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:21,218
and

620
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:30,221
Yeah, I guess I guess I could list things like that I guess the like baseline is that things are

621
00:47:30,721 --> 00:47:36,945
more stressful in some ways, but they're also more peaceful in like economical,

622
00:47:37,645 --> 00:47:44,210
what do I spend my time on ways. Yeah, I mean I'm generally glad to hear that. It sounds

623
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:48,452
like the price of success. Are you still contributing to Noita at all? I know you

624
00:47:48,472 --> 00:47:54,396
were working on that for a little while. Yeah, actually like a spoiler alert,

625
00:47:54,796 --> 00:47:59,299
Baba is You was made entirely on my free time. My day job was Noita for the past seven years.

626
00:48:00,806 --> 00:48:04,089
I'm now, I'm currently not working on Noita anymore.

627
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:09,955
After seven years, it was kind of, the game came out on early access.

628
00:48:10,535 --> 00:48:14,459
Early access and the scene has been doing really, like,

629
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,543
people have been seeming to like the game a lot and so on, so it was kind of,

630
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:24,908
it was time to look for, look for other, like,

631
00:48:26,358 --> 00:48:31,760
set my sights in the future as they say. I'm sorry you can't see my hand waving over here but

632
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:40,424
like imagine artistic hand waves but yeah Noita was kind of has been a big part of my past

633
00:48:41,064 --> 00:48:48,387
several years. Nice. Yeah and Noita is also in GDCA awards this year so that's that's also a thing

634
00:48:48,507 --> 00:48:53,449
it's nice that people have kind of received it so so very kindly.

635
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:59,787
Yeah, no, absolutely. I think that sort of points to a through line of these two games, right?

636
00:48:59,807 --> 00:49:03,808
I mean, I think both were also in the IGF as well. I mean, both have sort of gotten attention

637
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:08,730
for being sort of innovative and rule-breaking and sort of getting into like the real...

638
00:49:09,951 --> 00:49:13,372
Well, they've both gotten attention for a lot of good reasons. And I'm so curious to know,

639
00:49:13,392 --> 00:49:17,453
like, they both sort of point to a theory of game design that you spoke to earlier,

640
00:49:17,513 --> 00:49:18,794
how you love games that...

641
00:49:20,271 --> 00:49:21,852
foster opportunities for players to go,

642
00:49:21,972 --> 00:49:23,292
oh, like aha moments, right?

643
00:49:23,312 --> 00:49:24,773
Where you just realize what you're supposed to do,

644
00:49:25,113 --> 00:49:26,974
where you discover something you didn't know worked.

645
00:49:27,934 --> 00:49:29,995
So much of Noida is about, like,

646
00:49:30,255 --> 00:49:31,955
figuring out how systems work together

647
00:49:31,975 --> 00:49:33,856
and discovering new and interesting ways to use them.

648
00:49:35,057 --> 00:49:37,117
I'm just curious, what, do you agree with that?

649
00:49:37,137 --> 00:49:38,978
And if so, like, what is it about

650
00:49:38,998 --> 00:49:40,679
the school of game design and game, you know,

651
00:49:40,979 --> 00:49:44,580
that really, you know, motivates you and inspires you?

652
00:49:45,481 --> 00:49:46,261
Why do you think?

653
00:49:46,681 --> 00:49:47,261
I think it's.

654
00:49:49,382 --> 00:49:56,126
From my personal perspective, I maybe wouldn't do an entirely similar comparison,

655
00:49:56,146 --> 00:50:07,971
because from my point of view, in Noita, the kind of surprise of how things work is very closely related to synergy in games,

656
00:50:08,011 --> 00:50:11,072
which is a very big old-school roguelike thing.

657
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:15,775
The thing where surprising things have been taken into account by the developers,

658
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:18,536
and you can do things that you...

659
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:22,631
that might not work in all games because they haven't been coded to take those into account,

660
00:50:22,651 --> 00:50:24,112
but they still work in Noita.

661
00:50:24,532 --> 00:50:30,974
Whereas in Baba Is You, it's less the kind of emergent, dynamic world part of it,

662
00:50:31,174 --> 00:50:37,876
and more the kind of developer intentionally building hard-

663
00:50:38,196 --> 00:50:45,718
not hard-coded, but like building handcrafted tricks to trick you and surprise you.

664
00:50:46,478 --> 00:50:48,799
words and also with Noita.

665
00:50:50,389 --> 00:51:07,256
All the, basically all the cool things you have seen of Noita, all the synergy and dynamic things are more to the credit of the amazing programmers Olli and Petri in the team who kind of made those things a reality.

666
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:11,858
I'd be more in the kind of design and graphics department of things.

667
00:51:12,158 --> 00:51:18,781
Because I know that that kind of synergy, the fact that...

668
00:51:19,614 --> 00:51:25,659
things that usually in games you don't expect to work do work and have interactions together

669
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:31,023
is something that I would say has been a very big driving force behind Noita specifically.

670
00:51:33,145 --> 00:51:38,269
Yeah no fair enough that's a great point it is so much about Bob as you is about that feeling of

671
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:42,813
you know like dealing directly with the mind of the puzzle designer and trying to figure out

672
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:43,714
what they want you to do.

673
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:48,986
Again, we have about five minutes left, so if you have any questions, then get them in.

674
00:51:58,407 --> 00:52:00,008
I think she's an associate publisher as well.

675
00:52:00,068 --> 00:52:01,970
She's a big deal.

676
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:03,271
She's an associate publisher.

677
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:04,352
I should use her right title.

678
00:52:04,873 --> 00:52:05,954
Yeah.

679
00:52:06,034 --> 00:52:06,815
She had a question.

680
00:52:07,436 --> 00:52:11,279
Her question was literally, how level design is possible?

681
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:13,982
And my joke to her was that clearly you just wrote down

682
00:52:14,122 --> 00:52:16,645
level design and possible and stuck an is between them.

683
00:52:17,045 --> 00:52:18,506
And that's how level design happened.

684
00:52:19,507 --> 00:52:21,769
What was your mindset for making Boba's U-Levels?

685
00:52:22,269 --> 00:52:23,310
I mean, I guess, like, this is...

686
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,111
We're at an interesting level right now, so...

687
00:52:25,431 --> 00:52:27,793
I guess you can explain some of your thoughts to us using this level?

688
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:28,614
I don't know, maybe?

689
00:52:28,654 --> 00:52:30,755
I don't know if that's a good one.

690
00:52:30,795 --> 00:52:32,376
It was basically like...

691
00:52:32,717 --> 00:52:35,599
Pikachu came to me in my dreams and told me

692
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:36,920
that you need to make these levels.

693
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,441
And I just followed the holy word of Pikachu.

694
00:52:39,902 --> 00:52:40,782
That's fair, that's fair.

695
00:52:41,403 --> 00:52:41,983
That'd be good.

696
00:52:42,003 --> 00:52:45,266
So, the way I kind of used to explain...

697
00:52:45,826 --> 00:52:46,667
Sorry for cutting you off.

698
00:52:47,762 --> 00:52:48,963
No, no, no, no, go for it.

699
00:52:49,483 --> 00:52:50,623
Okay, okay.

700
00:52:50,663 --> 00:52:52,464
So for me, the way I've explained

701
00:52:52,564 --> 00:52:54,825
Babai's use of level design has been using the term

702
00:52:54,985 --> 00:52:57,486
reverse engineering and completely misusing the term,

703
00:52:57,526 --> 00:52:58,586
but here we go anyway.

704
00:52:59,126 --> 00:53:01,507
So the way I approach level design,

705
00:53:01,667 --> 00:53:04,648
or I would like to say I approach level design this way,

706
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:06,769
obviously, anytime a game developer says that

707
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:09,750
I did this to make the game, they are lying

708
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:11,931
because they are combining many things,

709
00:53:12,251 --> 00:53:14,231
both consciously and unconsciously, but.

710
00:53:15,384 --> 00:53:19,625
At least when it comes to what I consciously know that I tried to do in Baba Is You

711
00:53:20,705 --> 00:53:22,786
I have these different words and different mechanics

712
00:53:22,826 --> 00:53:31,389
There's the block pushing part, the different movement systems and actually implementing the movement system was one of those like extremely difficult things that are still

713
00:53:31,729 --> 00:53:33,929
Broken in many ways that you hopefully don't notice

714
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:38,051
And I have these different rules that could interact with each other

715
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:40,492
so when I start at a new level or when I kind of

716
00:53:41,232 --> 00:53:47,795
made mental notes about level ideas, I usually try to think of those systems and concepts and words

717
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:55,799
and combine them in my mind, just kind of trying to figure out combinations of words or combinations

718
00:53:55,819 --> 00:54:01,022
of words and mechanics that I hadn't considered before. Like, what would happen if I have this

719
00:54:01,182 --> 00:54:06,204
and this thing co-existing at the same time? Is there something cool that could happen,

720
00:54:06,264 --> 00:54:10,566
like something that looks cool or feels cool or is surprising in some way?

721
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:17,398
And for a very long time it was very easy to come up with those surprises.

722
00:54:17,998 --> 00:54:22,201
Like I could get a lot of ideas of kind of, oh that would be pretty surprising, all right.

723
00:54:23,101 --> 00:54:30,465
And so I kind of took one of those ideas, those that felt especially cool,

724
00:54:30,685 --> 00:54:33,147
or sometimes those that didn't feel especially cool,

725
00:54:33,327 --> 00:54:36,528
and those didn't make us good levels and I canned them eventually.

726
00:54:36,548 --> 00:54:41,111
That's something that felt like it could have potential to make an interesting...

727
00:54:41,793 --> 00:54:49,059
interaction and then I made a level where I tried to build a structure that forces the player to use

728
00:54:49,279 --> 00:54:54,723
that specific interaction to solve it so that if I think the interaction looks or feels cool

729
00:54:55,364 --> 00:55:01,649
the player has to see the cool thing to solve the level. So in this particular level this was

730
00:55:01,689 --> 00:55:05,492
actually added later after the release because I felt the

731
00:55:06,457 --> 00:55:12,919
weight functionality that you can press a button where things that are move move but Baba doesn't move

732
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:18,042
needed some tutorialization. I completely botched the word because this doesn't work really well as

733
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:23,264
a tutorial but that's the kind of intention behind this. So here my mindset was that okay

734
00:55:23,884 --> 00:55:31,747
you can press A to wait and let things that move move but make like you not move for one turn.

735
00:55:32,968 --> 00:55:35,849
I would like to make a level where you're forced to

736
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:44,556
to use the wait button to solve the level. And then I just like organically put walls down.

737
00:55:44,916 --> 00:55:50,139
It was very hard to make paper notes for Baba Is You because it was so much easier to kind of doodle

738
00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:54,521
things in the actual editor and see how things work. So in this case I just doodled the level.

739
00:55:54,721 --> 00:56:00,745
I think I took a couple of tries, but eventually I ended up with this structure. Sometimes

740
00:56:00,805 --> 00:56:01,965
afterwards I felt that the...

741
00:56:02,624 --> 00:56:06,885
solution was too obvious and added some like extra elements to kind of obfuscate the solution,

742
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:13,586
but that was sometimes also a bad idea because it could like drive the player's attention away from the cool twist.

743
00:56:14,587 --> 00:56:14,887
But then,

744
00:56:16,107 --> 00:56:19,148
yeah, that's kind of the basic process.

745
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:25,069
I guess this level is not the best example because here the cool interaction is a very simple one. It's like press one button.

746
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:29,330
I won't tell you when you need to press that button to solve the level, but...

747
00:56:30,051 --> 00:56:32,872
That's what you need to do at one point of the level to solve it.

748
00:56:33,713 --> 00:56:39,016
I guess a better example would be that there's later on the word shift that makes things work as conveyor belts.

749
00:56:39,376 --> 00:56:42,817
Like belt is shift and if you move on a belt, the belt pushes you along.

750
00:56:43,398 --> 00:56:49,721
And I realized that if you put two belts on top of each other, obviously they push each other at the same time.

751
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:53,523
So they just become like this perpetual mobile that just moves on.

752
00:56:54,381 --> 00:56:56,582
forever, like two conveyor belts pushing each other.

753
00:56:56,602 --> 00:57:01,686
And I made a level around that, because it was a cool sounding interaction

754
00:57:02,086 --> 00:57:06,830
between the same work, but still kind of two things doing some something.

755
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:11,834
This level is instantly one of my favorites, because I failed and found the salute.

756
00:57:11,894 --> 00:57:13,996
I failed and it showed me a way forward.

757
00:57:14,016 --> 00:57:15,757
Yeah, that's nice.

758
00:57:15,777 --> 00:57:16,878
That's what I'm working on right now.

759
00:57:17,198 --> 00:57:19,340
Man, I could play this game all day.

760
00:57:20,921 --> 00:57:22,102
We could yak it up all day.

761
00:57:22,942 --> 00:57:29,946
Um, uh, but, uh, I do not quite, we do not quite have the time to do that.

762
00:57:30,306 --> 00:57:33,288
Um, oh man, I'm so close, I'm so close, I need to make Skull Bolt, I think.

763
00:57:33,768 --> 00:57:35,108
Um, maybe I'm wrong.

764
00:57:35,229 --> 00:57:37,430
But, anyway, I just have the need to wrap things up.

765
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:42,592
Uh, if you enjoy BaBa's U and you want to see it, uh, at the Game Developers' Choice Awards ceremony,

766
00:57:42,872 --> 00:57:46,914
you can either attend the ceremony live at GDC, which is coming up next month.

767
00:57:46,974 --> 00:57:48,255
Jeez, we're only a month away.

768
00:57:49,056 --> 00:57:50,557
Oh, geez. Oh, geez.

769
00:57:51,278 --> 00:57:52,339
Um...

770
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,101
Uh... and, um...

771
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:56,504
If you are not coming to GDC, we'll miss you,

772
00:57:56,604 --> 00:57:59,047
but you can watch the ceremony on March 18th

773
00:57:59,087 --> 00:58:00,568
here on the GDC Twitch channel.

774
00:58:00,628 --> 00:58:02,731
Just click that follow button.

775
00:58:03,131 --> 00:58:04,573
And if you do that, you'll get a notification

776
00:58:04,593 --> 00:58:06,395
when we go live. We'll also have other great interviews

777
00:58:06,595 --> 00:58:08,177
coming up with some of the other nominees.

778
00:58:09,097 --> 00:58:15,319
We've got all year round we are doing interviews of interesting game developers, because GDC

779
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:20,881
is about learning about how games get made, how games get sold, how developers make games,

780
00:58:20,941 --> 00:58:24,662
what their lives are like making games, it's all those things, it's more, and we try to

781
00:58:24,722 --> 00:58:27,743
embody that here on the channel by talking to the people who make games, and playing

782
00:58:27,783 --> 00:58:30,504
them, and showing you sometimes how frustrating it can be.

783
00:58:30,564 --> 00:58:31,365
But sometimes it's great!

784
00:58:33,985 --> 00:58:37,707
Arvi, thank you so much for joining us and I hope you have a wonderful day.

785
00:58:37,867 --> 00:58:42,308
If people have questions for you at BabaSU, where should they ask them?

786
00:58:42,908 --> 00:58:49,050
I actually just opened the stream, so I will be in the chat if some people want to ask questions directly.

787
00:58:49,811 --> 00:58:53,992
But otherwise, you can send me questions on Twitter.

788
00:58:56,073 --> 00:58:59,734
You can say at BabaSU under Dash on Twitter.

789
00:58:59,854 --> 00:59:01,755
I think that's maybe the easiest way to...

790
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:07,939
get questions to me. I usually answer, at least I answer easy, nice questions very quickly.

791
00:59:07,959 --> 00:59:12,743
If there are difficult questions, then I might hesitate, but thank you very much for having me.

792
00:59:12,803 --> 00:59:18,867
It was very nice to talk about Baba Is You and, yeah, be a disembodied voice, as mentioned earlier.

793
00:59:18,887 --> 00:59:23,391
I really like sometimes being a disembodied voice. It feels like I'm a ghost.

794
00:59:24,632 --> 00:59:25,993
You're good at it. You sell it.

795
00:59:26,013 --> 00:59:27,694
Thank you. You too.

796
00:59:29,455 --> 00:59:30,857
Thank you all so much for watching.

797
00:59:31,328 --> 00:59:32,215
Have a good day everyone. Bye.
