1
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,892
Hi, so just a few things before we get started.

2
00:00:10,892 --> 00:00:13,653
Please remember to fill out your evaluation forms

3
00:00:13,653 --> 00:00:16,614
at the end of this session and other sessions you attend.

4
00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:19,575
It's really helpful for speakers to improve

5
00:00:19,575 --> 00:00:23,077
and learn about their speaking.

6
00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:25,098
And if you have cell phones,

7
00:00:25,098 --> 00:00:27,078
just make sure they're on silent.

8
00:00:27,078 --> 00:00:31,000
And we'll most likely be using the wrap-up room.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,761
I know my talk is going on pretty long, so.

10
00:00:34,848 --> 00:00:36,289
I don't know if we'll get to any questions,

11
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:39,372
but there'll be a wrap-up room after this,

12
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,633
so you guys can just come in.

13
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:42,815
We can continue the discussion.

14
00:00:42,815 --> 00:00:46,979
All right.

15
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:49,682
So, hi, my name's Julia Karanditar,

16
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,423
and I'm a game designer at Untamed.

17
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:54,103
My talk is called History Shaping Design,

18
00:00:54,103 --> 00:00:56,665
Inequality and Player Behavior.

19
00:00:56,665 --> 00:00:59,927
Before we get started though, I do have a few disclaimers.

20
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:02,189
So this is a series of talks I've given

21
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:03,610
called History Shaping Design.

22
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,352
And usually I look at game systems from the past

23
00:01:06,352 --> 00:01:07,773
and try to understand their context,

24
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:10,695
the time period that they were made in their culture

25
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,877
in order to understand those relationships

26
00:01:12,877 --> 00:01:16,140
and the design decisions made around that game.

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,481
And again, like what we can learn as designers now

28
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:19,983
about our own time period and our own.

29
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:24,632
culture and how it's, you know, influencing our designs.

30
00:01:24,632 --> 00:01:28,493
But this time I'm sort of focusing more on recent events, so this is not so much about

31
00:01:28,493 --> 00:01:30,914
looking at the past or comparing the past.

32
00:01:30,914 --> 00:01:38,195
And in particular I'm looking at unequal systems and how they shape people's behavior.

33
00:01:38,195 --> 00:01:43,757
And I'll be comparing game systems and economic systems, both of which are very complex and

34
00:01:43,757 --> 00:01:45,437
very different.

35
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,152
And also for this talk, I'm going over and covering

36
00:01:49,152 --> 00:01:52,354
a lot of different psychology studies.

37
00:01:52,354 --> 00:01:54,455
But psychology research tends to be very muddy

38
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:56,556
because they're trying to analyze

39
00:01:56,556 --> 00:01:58,697
the complexity of human nature.

40
00:01:58,697 --> 00:02:00,018
And there's lots of variables.

41
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:03,760
And so variables are hard to isolate and analyze.

42
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,122
So just take some of the conclusions

43
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:09,384
with a grain of salt. This is not a very hard or fast

44
00:02:09,384 --> 00:02:09,724
science.

45
00:02:09,724 --> 00:02:13,106
This is something that's sometimes very hard to predict.

46
00:02:13,853 --> 00:02:22,417
Also, just due to time, I'm not going to go into too much of the studies that I've included,

47
00:02:22,417 --> 00:02:27,039
but I am going to reference them on my slides so you can look them up and read more information

48
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:28,779
on your own time if you're interested.

49
00:02:28,779 --> 00:02:34,682
Also, I'm using a lot of economic data and cultural references coming out of the U.S.

50
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:36,362
in particular.

51
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:39,884
Part of this is because I live in the U.S., so I'm most comfortable talking about, you

52
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:42,705
know, the country that I grew up in.

53
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,694
But I also believe that the US does have sort of an accelerated pace of particularly income

54
00:02:48,694 --> 00:02:53,998
and wealth inequality that seems to be going faster than other developed countries, so

55
00:02:53,998 --> 00:02:56,760
it makes for an interesting test case.

56
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:04,926
Alright, so we evolved two forms of thinking, one logical and energy heavy that we use sparingly,

57
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:07,048
and one fast and effortless that we use a lot.

58
00:03:07,543 --> 00:03:11,006
Heuristics is the understanding of how our fast brains work

59
00:03:11,006 --> 00:03:14,248
and how it explains some of the seemingly illogical ways

60
00:03:14,248 --> 00:03:16,469
we process information, make decisions,

61
00:03:16,469 --> 00:03:18,570
and navigate complex systems.

62
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,172
Now, as game designers, we use tricks and tools

63
00:03:21,172 --> 00:03:23,633
to help our fast brain understand our games.

64
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:25,615
An example is the use of visual elements

65
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:27,756
that draw players to certain places in our world,

66
00:03:27,756 --> 00:03:30,217
giving them a sense of direction without forcing them

67
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:31,818
through a series of instructions.

68
00:03:31,818 --> 00:03:32,799
They sort of already kind of.

69
00:03:33,264 --> 00:03:35,586
you know, an interesting thing catches their eye

70
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:36,907
and they want to gravitate to that thing.

71
00:03:36,907 --> 00:03:40,570
We don't need to tell them where to go necessarily.

72
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,653
Heuristics in economics is called behavioral economics

73
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:45,414
and economic designers and marketers

74
00:03:45,414 --> 00:03:47,116
can use similar tools to control

75
00:03:47,116 --> 00:03:48,937
how we think about purchasing things.

76
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,479
In this example, I'm giving a list price,

77
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:54,061
which is usually at a higher price point

78
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:56,283
than people would usually buy that item at,

79
00:03:56,283 --> 00:03:59,346
but it gives the illusion of a really great discount

80
00:03:59,346 --> 00:04:00,387
off of that item.

81
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,743
So one of the ways this is achieved is through something

82
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:06,564
called priming or framing.

83
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:08,825
Priming or framing describes the fact that we are always

84
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:09,606
making comparisons.

85
00:04:09,606 --> 00:04:12,447
And we tend to use the most recent things we were thinking

86
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:15,029
about or information in our immediate environment to

87
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:17,710
influence our choices and actions, even if they are

88
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:20,152
seemingly unrelated and even if we're not even aware we're

89
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:22,733
doing so.

90
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:25,015
So for example, if I were to show you a picture of a dust

91
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:28,376
pan and then asked you to fill in the blank, most people will

92
00:04:28,376 --> 00:04:31,018
jump to the word soap, sort of connecting the dust

93
00:04:31,018 --> 00:04:31,818
pan to cleaning.

94
00:04:32,654 --> 00:04:37,797
This might be, you know, I might have triggered a different outcome if I had changed up the image.

95
00:04:37,797 --> 00:04:42,019
Now, priming is used in a lot of UI, UX, and game design, right?

96
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:45,941
By using players' ingrained knowledge of how the world works,

97
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:50,343
designers can quickly communicate how elements should behave,

98
00:04:50,343 --> 00:04:52,924
and sort of, you know, using that knowledge,

99
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:55,406
we can prevent players from feeling frustrated,

100
00:04:55,406 --> 00:04:59,568
because they sort of understand right away how something would look.

101
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:02,258
For example, like I will probably know,

102
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:04,500
jumping on something with spikes is not a good idea,

103
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,702
but jumping on something that looks soft and mushroomy

104
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:08,323
is probably fine.

105
00:05:08,323 --> 00:05:11,306
Apart from just using visual elements,

106
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:13,367
planning levels so players are kind of equipped

107
00:05:13,367 --> 00:05:15,469
with the right tools or in the right frame of mind

108
00:05:15,469 --> 00:05:17,211
before ramping up on a challenge

109
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:20,073
or offering a series of more difficult puzzles.

110
00:05:20,474 --> 00:05:24,036
can help them understand what they need to know next easily,

111
00:05:24,036 --> 00:05:25,837
and again, minimizing frustration.

112
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:28,018
So in this example, this is Zelda Breath of the Wild,

113
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:31,039
and in this room there were lots of buried treasures,

114
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,560
and usually when players come across those buried treasures,

115
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,161
they know they need to use the magnet tool

116
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:36,121
in order to unearth them,

117
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:39,343
but the magnet tool also just happens to be the tool

118
00:05:39,343 --> 00:05:41,784
you need to use to unlock the secret door

119
00:05:41,784 --> 00:05:43,385
and move on to the next series of challenges.

120
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,286
So priming here is the use of the buried treasures

121
00:05:46,286 --> 00:05:48,707
to get players to be equipping with the right tool.

122
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:51,868
in order to move on to more difficult actions.

123
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:56,492
Now this effect of priming can also show

124
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:58,633
some seemingly illogical purchasing behaviors

125
00:05:58,633 --> 00:05:59,894
that we might have.

126
00:05:59,894 --> 00:06:02,355
So for example, if there was a discount

127
00:06:02,355 --> 00:06:04,097
on a new flat screen TV,

128
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,179
maybe there's $100 off of a flat screen TV,

129
00:06:07,179 --> 00:06:09,260
this might make people think

130
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,601
that this is a really good deal,

131
00:06:10,601 --> 00:06:12,202
good enough to maybe drive across town

132
00:06:12,202 --> 00:06:14,864
and go to that particular store that has that deal,

133
00:06:14,864 --> 00:06:16,185
or maybe to wait in a long line

134
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:18,126
in order to get that coupon.

135
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:22,116
or that limited time offer in order to secure that savings.

136
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:26,808
However, when presented with the sale of a new car,

137
00:06:26,808 --> 00:06:28,848
most people won't apply the same amount of time

138
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:29,289
to save that $100.

139
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:31,829
Now, traditionally in economics, this is sort of weird

140
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:35,791
because economists are like, we're logical beings

141
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:39,572
and we should sort of apply the same effort

142
00:06:39,572 --> 00:06:40,152
to save that $100.

143
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:42,573
It shouldn't matter if it comes from a flat screen TV

144
00:06:42,573 --> 00:06:44,453
or if it comes from a brand new car.

145
00:06:44,453 --> 00:06:47,314
But we do have different behaviors, right?

146
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:48,735
We're not as motivated.

147
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:50,179
And why is this?

148
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:53,062
Well, it's because we're being primed by the actual purchase

149
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:54,143
price of the item.

150
00:06:54,143 --> 00:06:57,666
It feels really good to save $100 off of something that's

151
00:06:57,666 --> 00:07:00,208
only a few hundred dollars, because the relationship is

152
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,249
much bigger.

153
00:07:01,249 --> 00:07:04,291
It seems like a much bigger discount versus something

154
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,672
that's a few thousand dollars.

155
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:09,456
So Dan Gilbert, a psychologist from Harvard, said, this is

156
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:13,299
why a lot of people will spend a lot of time and effort

157
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:13,639
cutting.

158
00:07:13,995 --> 00:07:16,916
two dollar coupons off of four dollar toothpaste,

159
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,037
but they don't spend the same amount of effort

160
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:21,357
looking through fees in their retirement funds.

161
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,978
Now, according to this USA Today chart,

162
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:26,019
the difference between 1% and 2%

163
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:27,359
of like an active managed fee

164
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:31,200
and your retirement fund over the course of like 30 years

165
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,101
is the difference between 200 and $300,000.

166
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:35,890
So it's really significant.

167
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,372
But because it's abstract and 1% and 2% just

168
00:07:38,372 --> 00:07:42,375
don't seem like they should be that different,

169
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,217
people kind of glaze over it and they

170
00:07:45,217 --> 00:07:47,359
don't exert the same amount of energy

171
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:49,801
saving something that is much more significant.

172
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:52,743
Priming can also change how we perceive the people around us,

173
00:07:52,743 --> 00:07:54,904
especially those who have less or more than us

174
00:07:54,904 --> 00:07:57,846
and how much inequality we're willing to put up with.

175
00:07:57,846 --> 00:08:00,328
According to this study done,

176
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:06,821
they looked at how people's framing changes

177
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:08,282
when confronted with different people.

178
00:08:08,282 --> 00:08:11,963
So for example, if I were thinking of a series of choices,

179
00:08:11,963 --> 00:08:13,504
it could be something as mundane

180
00:08:13,504 --> 00:08:14,684
as going to the grocery store

181
00:08:14,684 --> 00:08:16,585
and figuring out what things I'm gonna buy

182
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:17,805
at the grocery store.

183
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:20,606
And I were to come across somebody asking for money,

184
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:23,067
I'm much more likely to frame that interaction

185
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,808
in terms of a series of choices.

186
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:26,128
So what did this person do

187
00:08:26,128 --> 00:08:27,569
to land themselves in this situation?

188
00:08:28,686 --> 00:08:34,048
That would be different if I were thinking beforehand about a series of chance events.

189
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:36,409
Maybe somebody I knew got into a car accident,

190
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:40,691
or maybe somebody I knew won a scratch-off ticket for like a couple hundred bucks.

191
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:42,551
Then I were to pass that same person,

192
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:45,412
I'm more likely to think of that person in terms of chance events.

193
00:08:45,412 --> 00:08:47,934
So like what kind of bad luck did that person

194
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:50,515
have that they're now in this situation where they're asking for money.

195
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:53,754
And this is important because it can change our behavior.

196
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:55,816
I'm much more likely to give to a person

197
00:08:55,816 --> 00:08:58,478
where I'm thinking about the events that

198
00:08:58,478 --> 00:09:00,479
may be outside of that person's control that

199
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:01,940
led them into this situation.

200
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,623
And the reason for this is if we see something that is unfair,

201
00:09:05,623 --> 00:09:07,524
we try to explain it in our mind.

202
00:09:07,524 --> 00:09:10,427
And if we can't do that, that can cause some discomfort

203
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:13,789
or it can cause us to try to rectify that difference.

204
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:20,732
Another aspect of priming or framing is something called the stereotype threat or boost.

205
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:25,834
Now this is if someone associates with a group that has either a positive or negative stereotype,

206
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:31,235
they might reflect that outcome on the results of an action that are related to that stereotype.

207
00:09:31,235 --> 00:09:36,136
So this is a study done by the World Bank where they took people from a high caste group

208
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:40,257
in India and a low caste group of India, they gave them logic puzzles to solve and when

209
00:09:40,257 --> 00:09:42,778
solved individually there's no distinction between the two groups.

210
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:46,158
You couldn't tell who was who, their performance was completely identical.

211
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,420
However, when they put the people together

212
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,481
to solve the puzzles in front of each other,

213
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:53,182
and it was obvious who belonged to what caste,

214
00:09:53,182 --> 00:09:55,744
the differences started to diverge,

215
00:09:55,744 --> 00:09:58,125
with the higher caste group performing slightly better

216
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,726
than the lower caste group.

217
00:09:59,726 --> 00:10:01,386
Now, the researchers were trying to think

218
00:10:01,386 --> 00:10:02,927
about why that could happen.

219
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:05,729
And they sort of concluded that if a person is associated

220
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:07,529
with a group that has a positive stereotype,

221
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:11,151
this might give them just enough confidence in the action

222
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:13,172
to kind of boost their performance slightly.

223
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:19,756
people who identify with groups with a negative stereotype might have the stress in disproving

224
00:10:19,756 --> 00:10:23,821
that stereotype, particularly when they feel like they're interacting with people who might

225
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:24,642
hold those beliefs.

226
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:28,583
you know, in their mind, you know, having to be twice as good or twice as smart to kind

227
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:31,005
of overcome that perceived stereotype.

228
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:35,708
And even the mental space of paying attention to those negative stereotypes might be enough

229
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:39,972
to impact that person's performance compared to a person who just wouldn't even be thinking

230
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:44,136
about it because their identity affords them the privilege of assuming those stereotypes

231
00:10:44,136 --> 00:10:44,936
don't apply to them, right?

232
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,858
They just, they wouldn't even be thinking about it.

233
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,915
Now, again, psychology research is very muddy,

234
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,697
and there has been different studies

235
00:10:52,697 --> 00:10:55,178
that show various amounts of this effect.

236
00:10:55,736 --> 00:10:58,458
And there has actually been studies that show the opposite,

237
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,041
which is that the pressure of having to overcome

238
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,923
that negative stereotype is going to motivate people

239
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:05,505
to work hard enough and that will actually

240
00:11:05,505 --> 00:11:06,586
boost their performance,

241
00:11:06,586 --> 00:11:07,807
making them perform slightly better.

242
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:11,150
But I brought this up because when I was reading

243
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:13,131
these studies, I was thinking about all the times

244
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,034
that I was, as a player, confronted with various

245
00:11:16,034 --> 00:11:19,317
difficulty selections before I even get to a puzzle.

246
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:22,239
And I'm wondering if that can somehow prime me to,

247
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,020
you know,

248
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,781
change my performance slightly.

249
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:26,441
If I select easy, for example,

250
00:11:26,441 --> 00:11:28,502
is that gonna give me enough confidence

251
00:11:28,502 --> 00:11:32,122
that I'll assume that I'll be able to solve those puzzles

252
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:33,763
or overcome those challenges?

253
00:11:33,763 --> 00:11:36,043
Or will it impact my performance negatively

254
00:11:36,043 --> 00:11:38,184
because maybe I won't be as activated

255
00:11:38,184 --> 00:11:39,384
or I won't be as challenged

256
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:41,965
if I think that they're gonna be easy?

257
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:42,585
So some priming takeaways.

258
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:43,625
We're always making comparisons.

259
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:54,618
We use the most recent and immediate or well-known data

260
00:11:54,618 --> 00:11:58,159
available to shape our choices and thoughts,

261
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,600
and perceptions can perpetuate.

262
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,680
Okay, so loss aversion is another bias

263
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,621
that can explain some of the behavioral changes

264
00:12:04,621 --> 00:12:07,142
that happen in unequal systems.

265
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:10,723
So this is the bias that makes the loss of something

266
00:12:10,723 --> 00:12:13,984
twice as painful as the gain of the same thing.

267
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:14,824
As shown in this graph,

268
00:12:14,824 --> 00:12:16,605
this is called a loss aversion curve.

269
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:19,306
As you can see, the curve is steeper

270
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,446
when the losses are negative.

271
00:12:21,154 --> 00:12:23,215
versus the gains.

272
00:12:23,215 --> 00:12:28,437
So in games, loss aversion is used in lots of different ways

273
00:12:28,437 --> 00:12:30,558
for making players feel motivated,

274
00:12:30,558 --> 00:12:32,238
feeling a sense of loss when playing,

275
00:12:32,238 --> 00:12:35,139
and amplifying punishments or bad situations.

276
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:38,561
Now, Jeff Engelstein had a great GDC talk last year

277
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:40,501
where he talked in depth about loss aversion

278
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:42,842
and in particular board game design.

279
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:44,163
But I'll be giving two examples

280
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,363
of how he used loss aversion differently

281
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:47,884
in the games he's worked on.

282
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:49,725
So this one is called The Expanse.

283
00:12:50,108 --> 00:12:52,909
And here, currency and victory points are the same unit.

284
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:58,031
So in order to set an action or plan a strategy,

285
00:12:58,031 --> 00:13:00,972
players are actually consuming their winning points.

286
00:13:00,972 --> 00:13:03,733
So this makes players slow down and pay attention

287
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:06,595
to the actions that they're going to be doing in this game

288
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:09,296
to make sure that they're going to compensate for that loss

289
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:11,076
of points that they have to spend on.

290
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:15,654
This is in contrast to his pit crew game.

291
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:18,096
Here he wanted to encourage players to take risks

292
00:13:18,096 --> 00:13:21,119
and also this game is team based,

293
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:23,981
so teams are kind of competing against each other.

294
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:26,864
So here it was important for the losses

295
00:13:26,864 --> 00:13:28,806
when penalty points were triggered by players

296
00:13:28,806 --> 00:13:29,687
to not feel so bad.

297
00:13:29,687 --> 00:13:33,971
So instead of a team's car moving back a step

298
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:36,833
when a penalty point is triggered, everyone else moves up.

299
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:39,555
Now again, and logically it shouldn't matter, right?

300
00:13:39,555 --> 00:13:42,297
It's the same as if you move back one or everyone else moves up,

301
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:44,138
but it feels different to players.

302
00:13:44,138 --> 00:13:47,019
And because it feels different to players, it doesn't feel so bad.

303
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:50,041
Therefore, you know, there's not so much of a sense of loss

304
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,502
when those points are triggered,

305
00:13:51,502 --> 00:13:54,264
and the teams will kind of stick together

306
00:13:54,264 --> 00:13:57,666
because there won't be so much infighting if somebody triggers a point

307
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,968
because there won't be necessarily that same impact of loss.

308
00:14:03,785 --> 00:14:07,165
Another place loss aversion can be found is in branching narratives.

309
00:14:07,165 --> 00:14:10,846
Because of the limitations of tech and content, most branching narratives need to funnel at

310
00:14:10,846 --> 00:14:11,946
some point.

311
00:14:11,946 --> 00:14:16,467
However, players can be very aware of the loss of their choice space in narrative outcomes.

312
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:21,429
They can imagine their characters going in one direction or following a certain sort

313
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:25,509
of storyline in their head and if it like starts to diverge into another area, they

314
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:29,770
can be, they can really notice that and that can feel very impactful to them.

315
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:35,248
Inventory systems are also where loss aversion can happen, right?

316
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:40,290
How much I'll value something I have in my possession than picking something else up

317
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,932
unless it's, you know, obvious that the thing I'm going to pick up is better

318
00:14:43,932 --> 00:14:46,173
or the thing that I have is damaged in some way.

319
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:51,987
And inventories also show this another aspect of loss aversion.

320
00:14:51,987 --> 00:14:54,749
Losses need to be proportional in order to have an effect.

321
00:14:54,749 --> 00:14:59,311
If I have 10 units of wood and I have 15 units in my inventory,

322
00:14:59,311 --> 00:15:02,133
I'm going to really think about that transaction and weigh it.

323
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:06,335
Is it going to be worthy for me to spend that 10 units of wood?

324
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:08,236
However, if I have 500 units of wood,

325
00:15:08,236 --> 00:15:11,177
I'm not probably going to pay the same amount of attention.

326
00:15:11,177 --> 00:15:13,358
I might not even think about spending 10 units of wood.

327
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:17,655
So there's many reasons that drive inventory hoarding,

328
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:24,063
but this aspect of loss aversion is one of them.

329
00:15:24,063 --> 00:15:26,846
Now, many free-to-play games use loss aversion

330
00:15:26,846 --> 00:15:27,647
as a player hook.

331
00:15:27,647 --> 00:15:30,070
The most common example is the use of lives,

332
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,533
or moves, or time in order to continue playing

333
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:34,115
and preventing the loss of progress.

334
00:15:34,744 --> 00:15:38,147
And daily combo bonuses also use loss aversion

335
00:15:38,147 --> 00:15:41,170
to motivate players to log in every day.

336
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,331
Now interestingly enough,

337
00:15:42,331 --> 00:15:44,212
even though the person hasn't actually logged in

338
00:15:44,212 --> 00:15:46,895
for the fifth day to get that really awesome reward,

339
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:50,718
because they're being promised that by missing out,

340
00:15:50,718 --> 00:15:53,521
it's the same thing as if they had had that thing

341
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:54,462
and now are losing it, right?

342
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:56,223
Because they're thinking about how cool it would be

343
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,265
to have it, it's sort of in their mental space

344
00:15:58,265 --> 00:16:00,507
that they already have it, and then missing out

345
00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:02,248
means that they've somehow lost it.

346
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:07,146
So, failed expectation of future gains is the same thing as losing them.

347
00:16:07,146 --> 00:16:07,947
It's the same effect.

348
00:16:07,947 --> 00:16:15,053
Another aspect of loss aversion is that many losses are more painful than a single big loss,

349
00:16:15,053 --> 00:16:20,237
even if the big loss is more in absolute terms than the sum of all the small losses.

350
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:27,151
And all of these explanations of loss aversion can maybe explain why the game Monopoly can

351
00:16:27,151 --> 00:16:29,373
have such a painful losing experience for players.

352
00:16:29,373 --> 00:16:33,177
It sort of uses all these different types of loss aversion really well, kind of compounding

353
00:16:33,177 --> 00:16:35,860
it to being this like really unpleasant experience, right?

354
00:16:36,422 --> 00:16:38,944
You're constantly losing little bits every turn.

355
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:42,126
As you start the game, you have a certain amount of resources,

356
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,187
but those resources start to dwindle over time

357
00:16:44,187 --> 00:16:46,789
as you slowly become more and more broke,

358
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:49,371
making each little loss more and more amplified.

359
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:51,412
And then just thinking about how painful

360
00:16:51,412 --> 00:16:52,853
it is to flip over cards, right?

361
00:16:52,853 --> 00:16:54,394
There's all these little actions you

362
00:16:54,394 --> 00:16:57,196
do to sort of add insult to injury when you're

363
00:16:57,196 --> 00:16:58,797
losing money in this game.

364
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:06,612
So loss aversion also affects all different types of economics.

365
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:10,593
We tend to hold on to a stock for too long if we feel like it's losing value.

366
00:17:10,593 --> 00:17:14,334
Instead of relying on the fundamentals behind the company,

367
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:18,315
in terms of like their profit or loss margin, or how healthy that company is,

368
00:17:18,315 --> 00:17:23,177
instead we try to hold on to a stock hoping that it will rebound to prevent that loss.

369
00:17:23,177 --> 00:17:26,677
And what will usually happen is we'll hold on to it for longer and longer,

370
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:30,538
it will lose more and more value and we'll sell it at an even greater loss.

371
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,449
There's a reverse effect of this.

372
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:36,271
We might be too scared to buy stocks at all

373
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:38,954
because we'll think that they'll lose value.

374
00:17:38,954 --> 00:17:39,695
So we'll take that money

375
00:17:39,695 --> 00:17:42,137
and maybe shove it under our mattress.

376
00:17:42,137 --> 00:17:44,519
But the problem with that is like that money in 10 years

377
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:47,602
isn't gonna buy the same amount just due to inflation.

378
00:17:47,602 --> 00:17:49,784
But because we don't think about that in those terms,

379
00:17:49,784 --> 00:17:51,486
right, it's not like we're actually losing money

380
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:52,547
coming out of our mattress.

381
00:17:52,964 --> 00:17:57,308
We won't think about inflation and its effects on it.

382
00:17:57,308 --> 00:18:01,052
And therefore, we might be too conservative

383
00:18:01,052 --> 00:18:04,095
in our strategies for investing in the long term.

384
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:06,858
We also tend to overvalue assets we have.

385
00:18:06,858 --> 00:18:09,400
So if we're putting a house on the market

386
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,981
or we're trying to sell something that we have.

387
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:16,074
We're framing that thing or that transaction in terms of losing that house or losing that

388
00:18:16,074 --> 00:18:20,518
thing that we're putting on the market instead of the money we're going to get for that thing.

389
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:25,023
And so there's usually a mismatch between the price somebody is willing to buy for it

390
00:18:25,023 --> 00:18:32,791
versus our desire or our tendency to be scared of losing that object.

391
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:40,986
And actually we're not alone in this. So monkeys have the same loss aversion that humans do

392
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:48,856
Researchers were able to teach monkeys a currency system and the monkeys could use their coin to buy from various different

393
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:52,781
researchers and one of the options they could do is buy

394
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:59,323
from a researcher that would offer one fruit and then give another fruit for a total of two fruits for one monkey coin.

395
00:18:59,323 --> 00:19:04,785
Or buy from a researcher who would offer three fruits and then take one fruit away for a total of two fruits for one monkey coin.

396
00:19:04,785 --> 00:19:08,446
Logically, again, it's the same thing. You're getting two fruits for one coin,

397
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:13,608
but monkeys really did not like seeing that fruit being taken away, so they avoided buying from that researcher.

398
00:19:16,503 --> 00:19:18,223
All right, so what does this mean with a society

399
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:19,784
with like growing income inequality, right?

400
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,525
We talked about how loss aversion affects game systems

401
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:25,566
and how loss aversion can affect economics,

402
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:27,966
but what about in society?

403
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:30,527
Well, so I think maybe some of the different aspects

404
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:32,108
of loss aversion might sound familiar,

405
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:36,989
particularly the expectation of future gains not being met.

406
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:38,950
So, right, if you're thinking that you're gonna do better

407
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,031
than your parents maybe, or if you have like a certain set

408
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:44,692
standard of living that might be in your mind and somehow.

409
00:19:45,223 --> 00:19:48,166
you're not making it or maybe your children aren't making it,

410
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:50,048
that can trigger that kind of loss aversion.

411
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:54,701
And this can show up in well-being and health standards.

412
00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:56,621
So this is a study where researchers looked at

413
00:19:56,621 --> 00:20:00,162
thousands of households in the UK and Germany,

414
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:03,622
and they tried to analyze or control

415
00:20:03,622 --> 00:20:05,843
for all different types of variables.

416
00:20:05,843 --> 00:20:09,163
But what they found was that the same loss aversion curve

417
00:20:09,163 --> 00:20:11,364
shows up in terms of income.

418
00:20:11,364 --> 00:20:14,444
So when somebody loses a certain amount of income,

419
00:20:14,444 --> 00:20:17,725
the impact for well-being is negative

420
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:20,285
by twice the amount as that same gain in income.

421
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:25,447
And well-being here is characterized by different mental and physical health outcomes.

422
00:20:25,447 --> 00:20:32,370
So this is pretty big because a lot of times economists will explain like,

423
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,671
oh, you know, when there's a hollowing out of the middle,

424
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:39,532
yes, you have people falling behind, but you also have people going up,

425
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:40,973
and that's really good, right?

426
00:20:41,326 --> 00:20:42,667
But the problem with that thinking

427
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:45,429
is that you have like a 2 to 1 ratio, right?

428
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:47,471
If somebody goes up, that's great,

429
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:50,573
but it's not compensating for the damage done by somebody

430
00:20:50,573 --> 00:20:51,874
falling out into the bottom.

431
00:20:53,290 --> 00:21:00,193
Another interesting aspect of this study was showing how incomes or jobs that have very

432
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:05,395
fluctuating amounts of revenue or income to an individual has the same sort of damaging

433
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:10,617
effect than someone who has a more stable steady stream of income.

434
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:16,219
Even if maybe that person in that variable, like freelance job, makes more in absolute

435
00:21:16,219 --> 00:21:20,661
terms, they can still have a more negative impact.

436
00:21:20,981 --> 00:21:25,662
just because we're always making comparisons and if we like have a lot of variable of income

437
00:21:25,662 --> 00:21:30,843
the differences between the really good times and maybe the okay times is going to

438
00:21:30,843 --> 00:21:32,804
have that negative effect.

439
00:21:32,804 --> 00:21:40,966
All right so some loss aversion takeaways. A loss is twice as painful as the joy of gaining the same

440
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:47,747
thing. Losses need to be proportional in order to have an effect. Many small losses are more

441
00:21:47,747 --> 00:21:49,308
painful than one big loss and

442
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,141
And unrealized feature gain is the same thing as losing that gain.

443
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:56,663
All right, so hindsight bias.

444
00:21:56,663 --> 00:22:02,046
This bias makes us want to point to reasons for something that just happened, right?

445
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:05,908
Things that just happened, they seem to be really predictable or inevitable

446
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:09,010
and we'll claim that we knew all along that they would happen.

447
00:22:09,726 --> 00:22:14,231
One of the reasons for hindsight bias is that the world is filled with so much messy data

448
00:22:14,231 --> 00:22:17,454
that it's really hard to understand why complex things happen.

449
00:22:17,454 --> 00:22:21,919
So our fast brains try to make that easier for us by pointing to a few different things

450
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,542
that could lead to an outcome so that we can learn from it and then

451
00:22:25,081 --> 00:22:30,526
use it in the future. The problem is we tend to oversimplify the reasons. We usually don't

452
00:22:30,526 --> 00:22:34,870
account for luck or randomness and sometimes we get those reasons wrong. If we have strong

453
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:40,474
assumptions or intuitions before that thing happens and then we point to those assumptions

454
00:22:40,474 --> 00:22:42,676
or intuitions that could lead us astray.

455
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:48,165
So hindsight bias is stronger when the event

456
00:22:48,165 --> 00:22:50,386
is negative or unfavorable.

457
00:22:50,386 --> 00:22:52,266
Here's a site from Trader HQ where they're like,

458
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:55,787
oh, the five indicators that foretold the 2008 crash,

459
00:22:55,787 --> 00:22:59,148
right, this is a really complex sort of black swan event

460
00:22:59,148 --> 00:23:02,969
that was very complex and involved global markets

461
00:23:02,969 --> 00:23:06,170
and deflationary housing prices and all this stuff.

462
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,531
But you can see that it's really easy after the fact

463
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:10,612
to sort of point to a few things and be like,

464
00:23:10,612 --> 00:23:13,312
oh, see, we could have totally known it would happen

465
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:14,853
by just looking at these things.

466
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:21,653
We can see hindsight bias play out when someone or something is successful,

467
00:23:21,653 --> 00:23:26,154
sort of attributing steps or actions taken, and again, town playing randomness or luck.

468
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:30,575
I think we've all seen talks or articles about like the five things you need to know

469
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,595
to be successful on X platform.

470
00:23:31,595 --> 00:23:36,316
The problem again with this tendency is that it reinforces priming of choices.

471
00:23:36,316 --> 00:23:39,577
And as I mentioned earlier, that can, you know,

472
00:23:39,577 --> 00:23:43,138
perpetuate the increasing amount of inequality we're willing to put up with, right?

473
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:44,238
It sort of overblows.

474
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:49,308
actions taken. Now, in particular, the U.S. has a sort of culture-stressing

475
00:23:49,308 --> 00:23:53,510
mitocracy, right? There's this sort of image of like the self-made man or

476
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:58,812
rags-to-riches kind of mythos that goes with being in the U.S. and this can make

477
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:02,314
policies around minimizing inequality harder because there's an assumption

478
00:24:02,314 --> 00:24:05,295
that if anyone can become wealthy they can, you know,

479
00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:09,657
anyone could become wealthy if they just apply themselves right now this isn't to say that

480
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:13,438
like the choices we make aren't important or that successful people didn't work really

481
00:24:13,438 --> 00:24:18,781
really hard to earn their success but it can make us forget things like luck and inheritance

482
00:24:18,781 --> 00:24:24,143
it also compounds and ignores systemic discrimination against minorities and women that go hand

483
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:26,785
in hand with income inequality particularly in the US.

484
00:24:27,373 --> 00:24:30,016
So this is a screenshot from Pew Charitable Trusts

485
00:24:30,016 --> 00:24:32,500
where they looked at intergenerational mobility.

486
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,742
So how likely a child born in one quintile

487
00:24:34,742 --> 00:24:36,685
will move to the other as an adult.

488
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:38,988
And as we can see, there is mobility, right?

489
00:24:38,988 --> 00:24:41,732
And there's a color for every column on this.

490
00:24:42,092 --> 00:24:47,233
chart, but there's also stickiness, right? 43% of people born in the bottom are going to stay

491
00:24:47,233 --> 00:24:52,595
there as adults and 40% of people born in the top are going to stay there. So that doesn't look like

492
00:24:52,595 --> 00:24:58,916
a, you know, system of pure mitocracy and, you know, this focus on choices and strategy

493
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:05,918
and actions kind of downplays this reality.

494
00:25:08,379 --> 00:25:12,442
So another interesting aspect of hindsight bias is how strong the effect can have on

495
00:25:12,442 --> 00:25:15,343
seemingly unchangeable views and value systems.

496
00:25:15,343 --> 00:25:19,005
So this study is a study that looks at choice blindness.

497
00:25:19,005 --> 00:25:23,788
Choice blindness is when making a choice we might not be 100% sure of our decision when

498
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:28,131
we make it, but after we make it we sort of look retroactively with this understanding

499
00:25:28,131 --> 00:25:28,851
of assurance.

500
00:25:28,851 --> 00:25:32,593
Like we always knew all along that we wanted to make that choice and that's the choice

501
00:25:32,593 --> 00:25:33,334
we made.

502
00:25:33,914 --> 00:25:40,816
So in this study participants would rate charged policy questions, questions like how far are against you

503
00:25:40,816 --> 00:25:44,977
for the government looking over your emails to prevent terror attacks, questions like that.

504
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:50,559
So they would rate those questions and then afterward the researchers would collect the results.

505
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,559
They actually swapped out the questions,

506
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:59,041
so they taped over a new set of questions that would change some of the policy questions and kind of flip them in reverse.

507
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:02,619
and then they would hand them back to the participants

508
00:26:02,619 --> 00:26:05,741
and they ask the participants to explain their choices.

509
00:26:05,741 --> 00:26:07,883
And almost 70% of the participants

510
00:26:07,883 --> 00:26:09,184
failed to notice all the changes,

511
00:26:09,184 --> 00:26:12,607
ending up arguing against their original position

512
00:26:12,607 --> 00:26:13,608
on at least one occasion.

513
00:26:13,608 --> 00:26:16,470
So this strong tendency to assume choices

514
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,772
made were done for a reason

515
00:26:18,772 --> 00:26:23,156
might be what's so powerful behind the use of games

516
00:26:23,156 --> 00:26:25,057
to make effective tutorial systems, right?

517
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:28,303
By collapsing the choice space provided to players to ensure

518
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:31,065
that they either get it right away or fail fast and then

519
00:26:31,065 --> 00:26:33,867
succeed, players can feel like the decisions they made were

520
00:26:33,867 --> 00:26:36,169
because they wanted to and knew all along what the

521
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:37,129
outcomes would be.

522
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:39,851
This makes learning more impactful and players more

523
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:41,853
likely to retain the information than if they were

524
00:26:41,853 --> 00:26:44,034
just told or shown what to do.

525
00:26:44,034 --> 00:26:47,176
And this is an example of Plants vs. Zombies tutorial

526
00:26:47,176 --> 00:26:52,861
system where the choice space is greatly reduced so people

527
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,262
can understand pea shooters.

528
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,192
Hindsight bias, though, can be really challenging for designers.

529
00:27:00,192 --> 00:27:02,154
It can lead players to groupthink.

530
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:06,036
If one strategy was successful and another not so, players might question the person

531
00:27:06,036 --> 00:27:11,260
who had the faulty strategy because they should have known all along that it wouldn't work.

532
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,204
It could lead to players repeating the same tested strategy, so if something works but

533
00:27:16,204 --> 00:27:19,907
maybe it's not optimal, it's really hard to get users to challenge that.

534
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:22,969
They'll just keep making that same strategy over and over again.

535
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:29,384
Now, there's no solution to completely eliminate hindsight bias in its totality,

536
00:27:29,384 --> 00:27:31,666
but there are ways to reduce it.

537
00:27:31,666 --> 00:27:35,650
So, some of those are to consider alternate explanations

538
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,813
or opening one's mind to different perspectives.

539
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:42,452
So I think games that use kill or death cams do this

540
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,293
to prevent the players from feeling discouraged

541
00:27:44,293 --> 00:27:46,534
in games with lots of instant kills.

542
00:27:46,534 --> 00:27:48,815
You know, being shown how much luck or randomness

543
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:50,116
was involved in a player's death

544
00:27:50,116 --> 00:27:51,537
can prevent this idea of like,

545
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:52,837
oh, I keep dying all the time.

546
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,658
I'm just not very good at this game.

547
00:27:54,658 --> 00:27:56,919
Right, instead they can see how much luck was involved

548
00:27:56,919 --> 00:27:58,700
and instead be like, oh, I wanna play again

549
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,161
because maybe next time I'll be lucky

550
00:28:00,161 --> 00:28:00,981
and I'll survive longer.

551
00:28:00,981 --> 00:28:01,602
So hindsight bias takeaways.

552
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:12,034
Hindsight bias can increase confidence but decrease rational thinking.

553
00:28:12,034 --> 00:28:16,379
It can be stronger when there are negative impacts or a perceived limited set of explanations.

554
00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:21,924
And having people think about other possible outcomes or effects can minimize the bias.

555
00:28:23,624 --> 00:28:25,948
Okay, so last place aversion.

556
00:28:25,948 --> 00:28:27,430
This bias I actually didn't know about

557
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:30,295
until I started researching for this talk.

558
00:28:30,295 --> 00:28:32,759
But I think many of us have probably experienced this,

559
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:35,263
particularly when we're going to check out

560
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:37,406
at the grocery store and we're confronted

561
00:28:37,406 --> 00:28:38,828
with a series of long lines.

562
00:28:39,158 --> 00:28:43,883
Maybe we're at the end of one line and then we realize maybe there's, you know, this line is moving faster.

563
00:28:43,883 --> 00:28:47,866
So we move to this line and then maybe we move to another line because that seems to be moving faster.

564
00:28:47,866 --> 00:28:51,189
And then we realized if we just stayed put, we'd probably be further along.

565
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:55,032
So there is research to back this up.

566
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:59,436
When people know that they're at the end of a line, they're twice as likely to swap queues

567
00:28:59,436 --> 00:29:02,058
and four times as likely to exit that queue altogether

568
00:29:02,058 --> 00:29:05,101
than if they know that just somebody else is behind them in queue.

569
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:07,803
Right. So as soon as somebody steps in line behind you, that kind of...

570
00:29:08,157 --> 00:29:11,879
that fear is minimized in terms of needing to swap queues.

571
00:29:11,879 --> 00:29:17,261
Last place aversion shows up in various economic situations.

572
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:18,961
So here's a chart from a study showing

573
00:29:18,961 --> 00:29:21,342
how likely people are for supporting an increase

574
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,543
in minimum wage policies broken down by income.

575
00:29:24,543 --> 00:29:27,865
And the people who are the least likely to support minimum wage

576
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:29,605
policies are actually those people making

577
00:29:29,605 --> 00:29:30,966
just above minimum wage.

578
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:36,896
So the idea of like if it's increased, then all of a sudden now I'm kind of in the same group making minimum wage,

579
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:44,460
that doesn't feel as nice to me, even though maybe it could benefit people on the lower end of the earning spectrum.

580
00:29:46,908 --> 00:29:49,909
So in games, you know, there's not too many game systems

581
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:54,250
that consistently trigger last place aversion,

582
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,350
at least that I've studied.

583
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,611
But I mean, I think that it shows up in various situations,

584
00:29:58,611 --> 00:30:01,032
especially for things like leaderboards

585
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,752
and endgame ranking systems, right?

586
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,592
You're always trying to make sure you're not coming

587
00:30:04,592 --> 00:30:05,613
in last place.

588
00:30:05,613 --> 00:30:09,034
There are systems that kind of collapse the extremes

589
00:30:09,034 --> 00:30:12,595
of the leaderboards if there are a lot of people.

590
00:30:12,595 --> 00:30:12,755
And

591
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:18,761
I think the addition of AI players in competitive games

592
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:21,222
can also kind of inflate

593
00:30:21,222 --> 00:30:24,945
the rank between the human players, right? This can amplify

594
00:30:24,945 --> 00:30:28,927
the pressure to need to, you know, make sure you're not coming in last,

595
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:32,790
maybe more so than competitive games without those AI players.

596
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,224
And ranking leads us back to, again, thinking about unequal systems.

597
00:30:41,224 --> 00:30:43,807
Now, most game systems, they're unequal, right?

598
00:30:43,807 --> 00:30:47,750
This drives competition, engagement, challenge, and suspense.

599
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,913
You know, if game systems were equal, like, no one would win.

600
00:30:50,913 --> 00:30:54,656
Even co-op games are, you know, players playing against a system, right?

601
00:30:54,656 --> 00:30:56,398
There needs to be a challenge to overcome.

602
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:57,619
There needs to be some sort of...

603
00:30:58,744 --> 00:31:01,526
unequalness in order to engage players.

604
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:05,528
And when there's not, there's not a lot of motivation or it just doesn't

605
00:31:05,528 --> 00:31:07,689
feel as challenging or interesting.

606
00:31:07,689 --> 00:31:10,911
So this is the Landlord's Game. This was

607
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:12,192
one of the original...

608
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:17,933
versions of monopoly and Lizzie McGee when she made this she wanted to compare

609
00:31:17,933 --> 00:31:24,797
a very like you know hard capitalist system against a more egalitarian system

610
00:31:24,797 --> 00:31:28,519
so she had two rule sets and the second rule set was like showing the merits of

611
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,861
a more equal world but it lacks the appeal of the competitive first system

612
00:31:32,861 --> 00:31:36,884
right like nobody really enjoyed playing the game where you go around the board

613
00:31:36,884 --> 00:31:38,725
and you redistribute wealth to everyone else.

614
00:31:40,052 --> 00:31:44,255
So people took that first rule system and kind of iterated on it and sort of

615
00:31:44,255 --> 00:31:47,978
made it into this sort of unbalanced game system that we know today as

616
00:31:47,978 --> 00:31:52,721
Monopoly. Now an unbalanced game system has the same sort of problems, right? It

617
00:31:52,721 --> 00:31:56,764
no longer provides a challenge to the winner and losers might feel like they

618
00:31:56,764 --> 00:32:01,688
have no control, prompting frustration and a sense of helplessness. So you know

619
00:32:01,688 --> 00:32:04,430
most games we try to limit this by rubber banding.

620
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:07,472
Now sometimes rubber banding is social.

621
00:32:07,472 --> 00:32:09,233
This usually happens when rank is obvious

622
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:11,834
and there's a clear ending like in Sari or Munchkin.

623
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:14,255
Almost always someone at some point

624
00:32:14,255 --> 00:32:15,736
will gang up on the winner

625
00:32:15,736 --> 00:32:17,917
when they have the agency to target other players

626
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:19,578
like knocking players home in Sari

627
00:32:19,578 --> 00:32:21,538
or attacking players in Munchkin.

628
00:32:22,998 --> 00:32:28,321
Sometimes the game systems can reward the players who fall behind.

629
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:31,463
Probably the most common example is Mario Kart, right?

630
00:32:31,463 --> 00:32:33,744
If someone's falling behind, they get better boosts

631
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:36,926
that they can then set up against people in the lead.

632
00:32:36,926 --> 00:32:39,328
But the problem with this is that the game...

633
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:44,312
system can feel like it's kind of putting its thumb on the scales

634
00:32:44,312 --> 00:32:47,615
and this can make the system feel unfair to players

635
00:32:47,615 --> 00:32:51,579
and if it done too much it can also make the

636
00:32:51,579 --> 00:32:54,762
you know unexpected last minute wins that just feel unrealistic

637
00:32:54,762 --> 00:32:58,926
and this ends up dulling you know a winner's sense of accomplishment when they win

638
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:00,587
or raises suspicion when they lose

639
00:33:02,907 --> 00:33:07,271
So, games that end up turning what we're banning into an explicit and clear game mechanic

640
00:33:07,271 --> 00:33:11,174
often become more palatable to players just because it's really obvious and clear that

641
00:33:11,174 --> 00:33:15,318
it's there and who can use it and when it can be triggered.

642
00:33:15,318 --> 00:33:20,402
And this is especially true in systems with AI players, right, because people are always

643
00:33:20,402 --> 00:33:22,884
sort of assuming AI players are cheating anyway.

644
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:27,708
So again, being as clear as possible with these kind of mechanics is important.

645
00:33:27,708 --> 00:33:30,250
So a great example is the robber in Catan.

646
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:35,054
And another great thing about this is that it also forces players to use it, right?

647
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,616
If you roll a seven, you have to use it.

648
00:33:36,616 --> 00:33:40,460
And this can remove some of the social pressure that players might have,

649
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,582
whether or not to punish somebody else.

650
00:33:42,582 --> 00:33:48,388
So, you know, this is all good, but what about an economy?

651
00:33:49,004 --> 00:33:52,947
When Michael Norton and Dan Ariely surveyed people in the U.S.,

652
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:56,791
they asked people what they thought their ideal distribution of wealth would be.

653
00:33:56,791 --> 00:34:00,694
What would create a system that would again motivate people to work really hard

654
00:34:00,694 --> 00:34:06,079
and innovate stuff, but also wouldn't be so unbalanced as to create some negative feedback loops?

655
00:34:06,584 --> 00:34:10,046
And surprisingly, across ideology, wealth, education,

656
00:34:10,046 --> 00:34:12,348
and other factors, more or less, this

657
00:34:12,348 --> 00:34:15,550
is the amount of distribution people wanted.

658
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,711
Again, surprisingly to me, I had assumed

659
00:34:17,711 --> 00:34:20,152
that people who are more conservative

660
00:34:20,152 --> 00:34:21,673
would want a lot of income inequality.

661
00:34:21,673 --> 00:34:24,875
People who are more liberal would maybe want more equality.

662
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:27,297
But actually, it's around the same amount.

663
00:34:27,297 --> 00:34:29,958
They then asked what they, you know,

664
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:33,200
those people, what they thought the actual distribution was.

665
00:34:33,722 --> 00:34:37,183
And again, across differences, people reported similar answers.

666
00:34:37,183 --> 00:34:40,084
This is what they think the distribution is.

667
00:34:40,084 --> 00:34:44,245
And this was the actual distribution of wealth in the US, again, from 2010,

668
00:34:44,245 --> 00:34:46,085
so about eight years ago.

669
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:50,726
So what does this mean for an economy, right?

670
00:34:50,726 --> 00:34:55,567
Again, like when things are unbalanced, they have negative impacts.

671
00:34:55,567 --> 00:34:59,648
Part of what could drive an economy when you have such inequality

672
00:35:00,905 --> 00:35:04,145
is that you have a lot of companies with a lot of capital,

673
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:07,106
and this can drive things like mergers and acquisitions.

674
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:09,346
So instead of coming up with really cool products

675
00:35:09,346 --> 00:35:12,927
and innovative systems, if a company has a lot of money,

676
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:15,908
you just sort of buy out other smaller companies, right?

677
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:19,508
And this can suppress research and development spending

678
00:35:19,508 --> 00:35:22,709
and can suppress different types of innovation.

679
00:35:22,709 --> 00:35:26,830
Also, when there's a lot of unbalance

680
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,450
between labor and capital,

681
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:29,450
you can actually have people

682
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:31,724
disengage from the labor force, right?

683
00:35:31,724 --> 00:35:34,806
If they think that if they're going to be working a lot

684
00:35:34,806 --> 00:35:38,427
and they're just not going to be able to earn like a living

685
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,749
wage, that might not drive them to earn an extra degree

686
00:35:41,749 --> 00:35:46,070
or try to go into different types of work

687
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,651
because they might not think it's worth the effort.

688
00:35:48,651 --> 00:35:51,673
Now, again, this is US distribution,

689
00:35:51,673 --> 00:35:56,635
but inequality is growing for other countries as well.

690
00:35:56,635 --> 00:35:58,956
So it's just another thing to think about.

691
00:36:00,021 --> 00:36:03,262
And, you know, like leaderboard ranking in games,

692
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:08,984
as an economy grows more unequal, status is emphasized.

693
00:36:08,984 --> 00:36:11,165
So, here's a study where researchers wanted

694
00:36:11,165 --> 00:36:15,267
to know what the difference is in search terms through Google

695
00:36:15,267 --> 00:36:17,848
for people who live in a more equal state like Colorado,

696
00:36:17,848 --> 00:36:19,528
compared to a highly unequal state

697
00:36:19,528 --> 00:36:21,529
like Louisiana or New York.

698
00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:24,270
And they found that about 70% of those differences had to do

699
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:26,311
with positional items, things like searching

700
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:28,612
for luxury brands, sneakers, jewelry, handbags,

701
00:36:28,612 --> 00:36:29,432
those kind of things.

702
00:36:30,562 --> 00:36:33,063
And another study from MIT wanted to see

703
00:36:33,063 --> 00:36:35,804
if they could find out the impact on US savings rate

704
00:36:35,804 --> 00:36:38,586
going to things called trickle-down consumption.

705
00:36:38,586 --> 00:36:40,687
As the economy becomes more unequal,

706
00:36:40,687 --> 00:36:43,088
there's more pressure to spend on goods

707
00:36:43,088 --> 00:36:46,130
to sort of keep up with the Joneses, right?

708
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,831
And they found that about between two to 3%

709
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:51,613
of the savings rate was lost to this increased consumption.

710
00:36:51,613 --> 00:36:53,574
Now, for those who might not know,

711
00:36:53,574 --> 00:36:56,976
Americans are not very good savers.

712
00:36:56,976 --> 00:36:58,997
We save around 5%, so two to 3% is quite significant.

713
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,825
So, you know, a lot of personal finance people are always like,

714
00:37:05,825 --> 00:37:10,350
why do people spend so much money on these, you know, positional items, right?

715
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,632
It doesn't make any sense.

716
00:37:11,632 --> 00:37:15,116
You should, you know, save that money and that'll help you build up an emergency fund

717
00:37:15,116 --> 00:37:17,119
or try to get you out of financial trouble.

718
00:37:18,124 --> 00:37:20,406
But I think people who have that assumption,

719
00:37:20,406 --> 00:37:23,027
they're not in the mindset of having to defend

720
00:37:23,027 --> 00:37:25,849
perceived stereotypes against them, right?

721
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:26,970
Particularly in the US,

722
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,392
wealth can signal positive attributes, right?

723
00:37:30,392 --> 00:37:32,213
We have this sort of subconscious culture

724
00:37:32,213 --> 00:37:34,694
that if we see somebody that's successful,

725
00:37:34,694 --> 00:37:36,415
we assume that that person's worked hard

726
00:37:36,415 --> 00:37:38,056
or is smart or is innovative, right?

727
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,818
And if you don't display that wealth,

728
00:37:40,818 --> 00:37:42,439
you might think people might not think

729
00:37:42,439 --> 00:37:44,600
that you work that hard or that you're that smart.

730
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,122
So there's pressure to offset that with positional items.

731
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:51,809
And this is another way that inequality can perpetuate.

732
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:55,370
So inequality promotes the need to show

733
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:59,491
outward signs of status, leading to increased consumption

734
00:37:59,491 --> 00:38:01,031
and decreased savings.

735
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:05,392
So this is a study Michael Norton

736
00:38:05,392 --> 00:38:07,513
and Catherine DeSels conducted,

737
00:38:07,513 --> 00:38:10,233
where they tried to look at five years of flight data

738
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:12,974
to see if they could find ways to predict the chances

739
00:38:12,974 --> 00:38:14,955
of a flight having to land because of air rage.

740
00:38:15,328 --> 00:38:20,111
Now, air age is when there's a dispute on the flight so severe enough that they actually

741
00:38:20,111 --> 00:38:24,755
have to land, like not at their destination, but wherever the nearest airport is.

742
00:38:24,755 --> 00:38:29,278
So these events are very rare, but they found that planes designed where people have to

743
00:38:29,278 --> 00:38:34,242
pass through first class were twice as likely to experience air age than planes where first

744
00:38:34,242 --> 00:38:37,845
class is either above the cabin or where people enter within the middle.

745
00:38:42,302 --> 00:38:48,967
You know, there's some problems with this study, mostly because, you know, again, sample

746
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:55,552
sizes and other things, but I bring this up because designers, they weren't trying to

747
00:38:55,552 --> 00:38:58,794
cause any disturbance within their passengers, right?

748
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,496
It sort of set up this way as an upsell.

749
00:39:01,937 --> 00:39:06,341
And I wonder if we might be creating the same unintended consequences

750
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:10,024
when we advertise something really cool that can be bought in our game.

751
00:39:10,024 --> 00:39:14,027
Now, there is a best practice of trying to introduce players slowly

752
00:39:14,027 --> 00:39:16,129
to different types of in-game purchases,

753
00:39:16,129 --> 00:39:18,691
but there are lots of games that have weekly specials

754
00:39:18,691 --> 00:39:21,514
where the first thing you see is this really cool thing,

755
00:39:21,514 --> 00:39:23,676
or open stores where a new player could go to

756
00:39:23,676 --> 00:39:27,099
and see an in-game purchase for a lot of money.

757
00:39:27,099 --> 00:39:29,381
And I wonder if this might be causing a similar tension.

758
00:39:30,275 --> 00:39:32,899
in our player group because they can maybe think,

759
00:39:32,899 --> 00:39:35,163
oh, I can just buy a lot of money,

760
00:39:35,163 --> 00:39:37,227
or maybe this game is kind of rigged

761
00:39:37,227 --> 00:39:41,534
toward people who have money to get these really cool things.

762
00:39:45,642 --> 00:39:51,527
So Paul Pift, he's a researcher at Berkeley, and he wanted to find out how people react

763
00:39:51,527 --> 00:39:57,651
to other people around them when they experience fluctuating status changes.

764
00:39:57,651 --> 00:40:02,875
So in this study, he had people come into a lab where they played a rigged game of Monopoly.

765
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:06,517
So a coin toss would determine who was the rich player and who was the poor player.

766
00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:11,181
The rich player got twice the starting money, the poor player only got to roll one die,

767
00:40:11,181 --> 00:40:12,221
and was only...

768
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:15,281
able to pass Go with $100 instead of $200.

769
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:18,444
So it was clearly rigged.

770
00:40:18,444 --> 00:40:21,387
However, within 15 to 20 minutes of playing the game,

771
00:40:21,387 --> 00:40:23,309
the behavior of the two people started to diverge.

772
00:40:24,237 --> 00:40:26,859
The poor person was more hunched over and quieter.

773
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:29,120
The rich person took up more space.

774
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,122
They started to pound their piece on the board

775
00:40:31,122 --> 00:40:34,024
with more force as the game progressed.

776
00:40:34,024 --> 00:40:36,726
And most interestingly, at the end of the game,

777
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,327
players were given a questionnaire,

778
00:40:38,327 --> 00:40:40,888
and one of the questions was what they thought

779
00:40:40,888 --> 00:40:42,289
led to their win or loss.

780
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:44,871
And rich players were much more likely to mention

781
00:40:44,871 --> 00:40:47,533
a series of choices or purchases they made early on

782
00:40:47,533 --> 00:40:49,314
as the reason for their success.

783
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:51,716
Very few would mention the coin flip,

784
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:53,877
which is of course the real reason why they won.

785
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:59,737
Charity is another thing that changes as a person's status changes.

786
00:40:59,737 --> 00:41:02,558
So while the wealthy give more in absolute terms,

787
00:41:02,558 --> 00:41:06,119
if you look at contribution rates compared to income, they give less,

788
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:09,660
with the bottom quintile giving about 10% of their total income

789
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,141
versus the top quintile giving between 2 and 4%.

790
00:41:13,141 --> 00:41:16,502
Now, some of this is explained by large numbers, right?

791
00:41:16,502 --> 00:41:20,363
If you're writing $500,000 checks, that just feels like a huge amount of money,

792
00:41:20,363 --> 00:41:23,583
but if you're making several million, it doesn't actually end up being a lot.

793
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,139
If you're making less than $20,000 a year,

794
00:41:26,139 --> 00:41:28,620
20 bucks here and 100 bucks there can add up really quickly

795
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,421
to a bigger percentage of your income.

796
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:34,883
But the people at the Chronicle of Philanthropy,

797
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:38,164
which puts out studies about charity trends,

798
00:41:38,164 --> 00:41:40,685
they point to a different factor.

799
00:41:40,685 --> 00:41:43,286
They think that as someone becomes more wealthy,

800
00:41:43,286 --> 00:41:45,787
they tend to look at their safety net in terms of assets.

801
00:41:45,787 --> 00:41:47,008
So if you have a savings account

802
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,789
and then you get into a bind,

803
00:41:48,789 --> 00:41:51,030
you can draw down on that savings, right,

804
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,470
to kind of tide you over.

805
00:41:52,908 --> 00:41:54,468
But if you don't have a savings account,

806
00:41:54,468 --> 00:41:57,089
you're much more likely to invest in the connections

807
00:41:57,089 --> 00:41:58,569
with the people around you, right?

808
00:41:58,569 --> 00:42:00,050
If you give 20 bucks to your neighbor

809
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,670
and then you have car trouble,

810
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,551
maybe your neighbor will give you a ride to work.

811
00:42:03,551 --> 00:42:07,312
So this tendency to focus on social connections

812
00:42:07,312 --> 00:42:09,552
versus assets can create an empathy gap

813
00:42:09,552 --> 00:42:11,633
among wealthier individuals.

814
00:42:11,633 --> 00:42:13,333
This can also be amplified, again,

815
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:16,034
by other cultural tendencies, particularly in the US.

816
00:42:16,324 --> 00:42:19,026
to think that wealthier people are smarter or more skilled

817
00:42:19,026 --> 00:42:21,448
than others of less means, right?

818
00:42:21,448 --> 00:42:23,630
So wealthier individuals can be primed

819
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,731
not to pay attention to the others,

820
00:42:25,731 --> 00:42:26,892
you know, other people around them,

821
00:42:26,892 --> 00:42:31,396
or at least not think about their input quite as much.

822
00:42:31,396 --> 00:42:33,497
So in another study that Paul Piff conducted,

823
00:42:33,497 --> 00:42:35,859
he wanted to see if a car status could predict

824
00:42:35,859 --> 00:42:38,381
whether or not it would notice and stop

825
00:42:38,381 --> 00:42:40,182
for a pedestrian trying to cross the road.

826
00:42:40,563 --> 00:42:44,365
and he was able to see a correlation again with the car status.

827
00:42:44,365 --> 00:42:49,368
A higher status car is least likely to stop for a pedestrian.

828
00:42:49,368 --> 00:42:54,572
So higher status people are less dependent on others.

829
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,814
This leads to cooperation and observation of the people around them.

830
00:42:57,814 --> 00:43:00,876
And this could be important for game designers as well, right?

831
00:43:00,876 --> 00:43:02,057
If one of your players is

832
00:43:02,558 --> 00:43:06,320
acquiring a lot of power, a lot of resources, and you're, you know, they're

833
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,801
relying on a team, you can have this sort of mismatch of

834
00:43:10,801 --> 00:43:15,924
behavior. However, you know, just like other kinds of priming, this empathy gap

835
00:43:15,924 --> 00:43:19,625
is made, again, because of information around people, right? What's in their

836
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:25,968
immediate space? If they're focused on not as much on social connections, then

837
00:43:25,968 --> 00:43:30,390
they're just sort of in this mindset. And Paul Pift actually found that

838
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:34,532
you know, just priming people or being reminded of the benefits of cooperation,

839
00:43:34,532 --> 00:43:37,754
community, and compassion were enough to remove this empathy gap, right?

840
00:43:37,754 --> 00:43:41,716
Just sort of reminding people how important their team members are were enough to be

841
00:43:41,716 --> 00:43:46,739
like, oh yeah, my team members are important. I should pay attention to them.

842
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:51,102
Um, so, uh, effects of status takeaways.

843
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:57,062
The more unequal a system is, the stronger the desire to show and compete for status.

844
00:43:57,062 --> 00:44:01,884
As people climb up in status, they rely less on social group for help.

845
00:44:01,884 --> 00:44:08,627
And closing the empathy gap caused by status can be done with a reminder of the importance of community and teamwork.

846
00:44:08,627 --> 00:44:13,148
Alright, so what about income inequality in games?

847
00:44:15,248 --> 00:44:19,712
Well, now there's a lot of pressure to find different revenue streams, right, in our games.

848
00:44:19,712 --> 00:44:22,354
And one way is to add in-game purchases.

849
00:44:22,354 --> 00:44:27,097
Now, lots of casual games were early experimenting grounds with various in-game purchase ideas.

850
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:31,680
One of the most common standards to come out was this two-currency system, right?

851
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:37,164
Hard currency, which you pay for actual money, and soft currency earned while playing the game.

852
00:44:37,164 --> 00:44:42,288
This allows the games to offer really cool items for sale to get additional revenue,

853
00:44:42,288 --> 00:44:44,830
but also gives a chance for people who might not have that money.

854
00:44:45,404 --> 00:44:49,227
the shot at buying or accessing those same really cool items.

855
00:44:49,227 --> 00:44:53,930
But to make sure that the hard currency is more valuable,

856
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:58,473
players usually need to sink a lot of time into the game in order to earn those items.

857
00:44:58,473 --> 00:45:05,537
I think one of the problems that's starting to emerge is in-game purchases move to many other types of games.

858
00:45:06,344 --> 00:45:13,487
and genres is that this focus on earning currency can change how players perceive the game.

859
00:45:13,487 --> 00:45:18,928
Chris Hecker had a really great 2010 GDC talk called Achievements Considered Harmful, where

860
00:45:18,928 --> 00:45:23,150
he talked about how extrinsic motivations can undermine people's natural desire to want

861
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:24,890
to explore and experience challenges.

862
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:28,152
by shifting the focus of a game system

863
00:45:28,152 --> 00:45:31,194
and playing that game system because it's fun

864
00:45:31,194 --> 00:45:34,496
or because it's challenging to having the player think

865
00:45:34,496 --> 00:45:35,977
about how many things they need to do

866
00:45:35,977 --> 00:45:37,238
to earn X number of currencies

867
00:45:37,238 --> 00:45:38,598
so they can get this really cool item

868
00:45:38,598 --> 00:45:40,640
that they saw in the store,

869
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,122
can switch how they frame that game from fun to work.

870
00:45:44,122 --> 00:45:45,843
Now, this is probably really hard to discover

871
00:45:45,843 --> 00:45:49,405
because players' engagement is probably just the same

872
00:45:49,405 --> 00:45:51,886
or maybe even more so if they're thinking about

873
00:45:51,886 --> 00:45:54,428
having to earn stuff in order to get cool things

874
00:45:54,428 --> 00:45:55,048
that they want.

875
00:45:56,152 --> 00:46:00,276
And removing this currency system might induce that feeling of unfairness,

876
00:46:00,276 --> 00:46:04,220
that sort of air rage or that rage that, you know, can present itself

877
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:08,084
when you're trying to upsell and people don't have access.

878
00:46:08,084 --> 00:46:10,987
So if those items can only be purchased, right, that could be problematic.

879
00:46:10,987 --> 00:46:15,271
So it's a really hard challenge, but I do think it's something we're thinking about

880
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:18,775
as we're implementing these currency systems in many different games.

881
00:46:21,521 --> 00:46:26,204
Adding multiple currencies can easily obscure the value of items, right,

882
00:46:26,204 --> 00:46:28,685
making it hard to calculate how something is worth.

883
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:31,827
So if a player thinks that an item is worth X amount,

884
00:46:31,827 --> 00:46:35,109
and then they use it and they feel like there's a mismatch,

885
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:37,010
they could regret that purchase, right?

886
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:38,110
They might regret that.

887
00:46:40,441 --> 00:46:44,762
And even more important is not changing the value of things already in existence.

888
00:46:44,762 --> 00:46:47,943
Again, going back to all the different types of loss aversion,

889
00:46:47,943 --> 00:46:52,224
if a player spends time or money or effort buying or customizing something,

890
00:46:52,224 --> 00:46:54,104
they put a lot of value into it.

891
00:46:54,104 --> 00:46:59,086
They have a strong value association with it.

892
00:46:59,086 --> 00:47:03,487
And any kind of change that happens that can, you know,

893
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:08,188
diminish that sense of value can upset players, right?

894
00:47:09,114 --> 00:47:13,819
So it's really important to think about if there is a challenge that needs to be made

895
00:47:13,819 --> 00:47:18,384
because, you know, we as game designers are always constantly using player feedback in

896
00:47:18,384 --> 00:47:20,686
order to adjust our systems.

897
00:47:20,686 --> 00:47:26,472
Trying to give as much time as possible for people to process that change is really important.

898
00:47:26,472 --> 00:47:32,218
And then taking even a further step back, thinking about

899
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:35,628
you know, what does this mean for all of us as designers?

900
00:47:35,628 --> 00:47:38,710
You know, we're working on balancing unequal systems

901
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:41,052
and understanding how people's behavior

902
00:47:41,052 --> 00:47:43,954
in those systems can change as they grow more powerful

903
00:47:43,954 --> 00:47:46,476
or as they obtain more or less status in a system

904
00:47:46,476 --> 00:47:49,098
is really important so that we can craft those systems

905
00:47:49,098 --> 00:47:52,661
we want our players to feel and to have.

906
00:47:53,145 --> 00:47:56,087
But we're also in an interesting point in time.

907
00:47:56,087 --> 00:47:59,489
For most of us in the US and maybe other developed countries,

908
00:47:59,489 --> 00:48:02,652
I think inequality is starting to shape some of the changes

909
00:48:02,652 --> 00:48:04,193
in our civic and social life.

910
00:48:04,193 --> 00:48:06,094
And trying to understand these current events

911
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:07,815
in light of some of this research,

912
00:48:07,815 --> 00:48:10,818
this is, yes, me trying to be affected by hindsight bias,

913
00:48:10,818 --> 00:48:12,759
right, I'm trying to understand this complex thing.

914
00:48:13,696 --> 00:48:18,798
But I think it might drive us to ask, are the things we're developing, are they reflecting

915
00:48:18,798 --> 00:48:20,299
this shift that's happening?

916
00:48:20,299 --> 00:48:25,121
Will historians years from now kind of analyze the game systems that you guys are making

917
00:48:25,121 --> 00:48:28,383
and maybe point to some of these changes?

918
00:48:28,383 --> 00:48:29,063
For example,

919
00:48:29,558 --> 00:48:32,680
Eric Zimmerman and Naomi Clark gave a 2011 GDC talk

920
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,842
where they identified a new genre called fantasy of labor games.

921
00:48:36,842 --> 00:48:40,684
These are games based on grinding where the main mechanic is time.

922
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:45,366
And unlike skill games, fantasy of labor games have little learned skill.

923
00:48:45,366 --> 00:48:49,188
Right. The appeal of these games is that any player can just jump in

924
00:48:49,188 --> 00:48:52,630
and move up the ranks if they invest enough time into these games.

925
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:55,191
Right. A classic example is probably Farmville.

926
00:48:55,717 --> 00:48:59,339
you plant a seed and then come back 15 minutes later and you get money for your pumpkins.

927
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:04,622
But historians might point to the fact that these games rose to prominence when productivity

928
00:49:04,622 --> 00:49:12,527
was decoupled from earnings, meaning as people made more and more things, their wages sort of

929
00:49:12,527 --> 00:49:17,129
stayed the same, they kind of flatlined. And these games might have been so popular because they

930
00:49:17,129 --> 00:49:22,712
provided this sort of escapist world reinforcing this myth of the harder you work, the more you earn.

931
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:26,772
a world looking less likely than the ones players were actually living in.

932
00:49:26,772 --> 00:49:34,157
Another important aspect I think we all need to pay attention to is the data sets we're

933
00:49:34,157 --> 00:49:35,378
using in building.

934
00:49:35,378 --> 00:49:39,761
Many of these data sets are preserving systems of inequality, not because they were designed

935
00:49:39,761 --> 00:49:44,264
to necessarily, but because they rely on data that reflects biases we humans have built

936
00:49:44,264 --> 00:49:45,024
in over the years.

937
00:49:45,543 --> 00:49:48,364
An example is using credit scores in the US

938
00:49:48,364 --> 00:49:50,885
to determine who can get hired, who can start a business,

939
00:49:50,885 --> 00:49:52,225
who could buy a home.

940
00:49:52,225 --> 00:49:55,346
And these systems are perpetuating

941
00:49:55,346 --> 00:49:57,227
racial and gender discrimination.

942
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:58,327
And even something as seemingly innocent

943
00:49:58,327 --> 00:50:04,289
as facial recognition software can have these biases built in,

944
00:50:04,289 --> 00:50:07,190
as shown by the research done by Joy Boulamani.

945
00:50:10,952 --> 00:50:17,056
So, and even further step back, you know, usually my talks end with like, okay, now

946
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:21,199
that we've learned about history, you know, how can we be more aware about making sure

947
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:25,002
we're crafting experiences that we want our players to have?

948
00:50:25,002 --> 00:50:29,185
But I'm sort of kind of flipping it back now on you guys because, you know, there's, you

949
00:50:29,185 --> 00:50:33,028
guys are very, very smart and we're all trained to sort of look at.

950
00:50:33,548 --> 00:50:37,490
balancing a game system, and now balancing an economy is completely different,

951
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:41,392
but I do think that maybe you guys have some fresh ideas and proposals,

952
00:50:41,392 --> 00:50:45,874
and maybe thinking about how to share that data with people

953
00:50:45,874 --> 00:50:50,196
who can actually influence things that will make

954
00:50:50,196 --> 00:50:54,578
the growing unequalness and unbalancedness that we see in our economies

955
00:50:54,578 --> 00:50:57,739
maybe less so. So, can game designers

956
00:50:57,739 --> 00:50:58,740
save the world?

957
00:51:01,588 --> 00:51:04,812
So thank you. That was a lot to unpack. Um,

958
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,333
I just want to spend a couple of time.

959
00:51:06,854 --> 00:51:08,936
moments thanking people.

960
00:51:08,936 --> 00:51:12,419
So, Sorin Johnson was my mentor.

961
00:51:12,419 --> 00:51:16,903
Jeff Engelsten, who has Ludosity podcast, which is amazing.

962
00:51:16,903 --> 00:51:19,845
And Project Horseshoe, if you guys worked

963
00:51:19,845 --> 00:51:22,227
and contributed on that, awesome, you guys are amazing.

964
00:51:22,227 --> 00:51:23,889
If you don't know what Project Horseshoe is,

965
00:51:23,889 --> 00:51:26,131
it's basically a game jam where designers

966
00:51:26,131 --> 00:51:30,014
write up white papers around different design problems,

967
00:51:30,014 --> 00:51:32,496
and they have amazing resources, so you should check it out.

968
00:51:34,201 --> 00:51:35,082
Thanks everyone.

969
00:51:35,082 --> 00:51:37,003
I don't know how much time we have for questions.

970
00:51:37,003 --> 00:51:40,145
Oh, here's some additional readings

971
00:51:40,145 --> 00:51:43,847
if you are interested in income inequality.

972
00:51:43,847 --> 00:51:46,930
I did a lot of research and a lot of reading,

973
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:49,311
and so here's some books you'll want.

974
00:51:49,311 --> 00:51:50,212
All right, thanks guys.

975
00:51:50,212 --> 00:51:50,452
Thank you.

976
00:51:50,452 --> 00:51:51,092
Thank you.

977
00:51:51,092 --> 00:51:52,093
Thank you.

978
00:51:52,093 --> 00:51:52,473
Thank you.

979
00:51:52,473 --> 00:51:52,994
Thank you.

980
00:51:52,994 --> 00:51:53,174
Thank you.

981
00:51:53,174 --> 00:51:59,378
Thank you.

982
00:51:59,378 --> 00:51:59,958
Thank you.

983
00:51:59,958 --> 00:52:00,959
Thank you.

984
00:52:00,959 --> 00:52:01,219
Thank you.

985
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:01,419
Thank you.

986
00:52:01,419 --> 00:52:01,599
Thank you.

987
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:01,880
Thank you.

988
00:52:02,272 --> 00:52:04,592
Wow, five minutes, geez, all right, I must have talked fast.

989
00:52:04,592 --> 00:52:05,553
Can I ask a question?

990
00:52:05,553 --> 00:52:05,813
Yeah.

991
00:52:05,813 --> 00:52:06,073
OK, cool.

992
00:52:06,073 --> 00:52:11,374
So I guess this is not a question of maybe

993
00:52:11,374 --> 00:52:13,055
if you had an observation on it.

994
00:52:13,055 --> 00:52:17,917
So I've been really researching a lot of collectible games,

995
00:52:17,917 --> 00:52:20,117
especially collectible card games.

996
00:52:20,117 --> 00:52:22,878
And some of the collectible card games,

997
00:52:22,878 --> 00:52:26,799
in terms of play mechanics, players

998
00:52:26,799 --> 00:52:29,900
tend to dumb down their play for other players

999
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,361
in order for them to like.

1000
00:52:31,755 --> 00:52:33,817
you know, even the playing field.

1001
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:38,802
So were there any studies or sort of moments in those studies

1002
00:52:38,802 --> 00:52:42,886
where they saw like their research like turn and be like,

1003
00:52:42,886 --> 00:52:45,128
this is unfair, or this is bad?

1004
00:52:45,535 --> 00:52:51,838
because there are a lot of games in the sphere that I'm researching that they just let that

1005
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:58,761
behavior happen and it is dependent by play group and it really like affects the whole format as a

1006
00:52:58,761 --> 00:53:06,465
whole so I just wondered if there was any. Yeah I was looking at so when I was trying to find games

1007
00:53:06,465 --> 00:53:12,608
that have or cause like a last place aversion I was like drawn to

1008
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:15,284
Left 4 Dead, or I'm sorry,

1009
00:53:15,284 --> 00:53:19,586
the Dead of Winter board game.

1010
00:53:19,586 --> 00:53:22,788
Because, like, that game is just so interesting

1011
00:53:22,788 --> 00:53:26,870
because it's like, you know, you have people

1012
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,751
whose job it is to tank that game,

1013
00:53:28,751 --> 00:53:30,872
but also because of how it's structured.

1014
00:53:30,872 --> 00:53:34,014
So, like, you have the goal,

1015
00:53:34,014 --> 00:53:35,014
and then you have your own goal.

1016
00:53:35,014 --> 00:53:36,715
If your own goal isn't met,

1017
00:53:36,715 --> 00:53:38,896
then there's some drive to tank the game

1018
00:53:38,896 --> 00:53:41,257
without that being, like, your goal.

1019
00:53:42,384 --> 00:53:45,585
But, and so that's sort of, I mean it's not last place aversion, but it's kind of

1020
00:53:45,585 --> 00:53:48,845
like this idea that like if I can't have it all, then no one can kind of thing

1021
00:53:48,845 --> 00:53:54,627
that maybe the designers were thinking about, but was interesting. But in my

1022
00:53:54,627 --> 00:53:59,047
studies in particular, most of it was just again on like social relationships

1023
00:53:59,047 --> 00:54:06,029
in terms of finance, so I didn't really see too much of that. Yeah, I don't know,

1024
00:54:06,029 --> 00:54:09,710
but definitely it's interesting to think about, because you definitely see that a

1025
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:10,330
lot in games.

1026
00:54:18,807 --> 00:54:25,709
So my question is, to what extent have you seen in studies or research in this,

1027
00:54:25,709 --> 00:54:30,310
that different play styles that arise from socioeconomic strata?

1028
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:34,991
Because it was interesting, like, particularly in terms of the status stuff you talked about,

1029
00:54:34,991 --> 00:54:39,373
and I wondered whether you see that carry over into actual gameplay styles from players.

1030
00:54:39,373 --> 00:54:47,475
I think that there are definitely examples where that, like,

1031
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:51,844
the relationship of people with a lot of status

1032
00:54:51,844 --> 00:54:54,866
or a lot of power are not necessarily as cooperative

1033
00:54:54,866 --> 00:54:58,288
with other people of lesser means.

1034
00:54:58,288 --> 00:55:02,551
And I think different, I mean, I don't know.

1035
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:07,594
I don't really have, I guess, that much knowledge

1036
00:55:07,594 --> 00:55:13,618
that I can just pull out of my head about gameplay examples,

1037
00:55:13,618 --> 00:55:17,661
but I'm sure it shows up in those kind of situations.

1038
00:55:25,703 --> 00:55:29,865
Have you ever encountered any developers' gaming last place

1039
00:55:29,865 --> 00:55:34,366
aversion by, for example, say, when you're in a queue

1040
00:55:34,366 --> 00:55:36,667
to get into a server, instead of showing how many spots away

1041
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,588
you are from getting in, showing how many people are behind you

1042
00:55:38,588 --> 00:55:41,349
and all the people who are worse off than you,

1043
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:41,890
into any sort of?

1044
00:55:42,931 --> 00:55:49,654
I haven't in games but the research for the Last Place Aversion looked at

1045
00:55:49,654 --> 00:55:55,976
queues for telecommunications so when you're in line for someone if somehow

1046
00:55:55,976 --> 00:56:00,738
you instead they can focus on like how many people are you are out of how many

1047
00:56:00,738 --> 00:56:05,880
people then that makes people like stay in line or on the phone longer if they

1048
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,081
know that they're like other people in the queue behind them that was what the

1049
00:56:10,081 --> 00:56:11,201
the studies were looking at

1050
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,697
I don't really know, again, how in depth that would work for games, but maybe it's something

1051
00:56:14,697 --> 00:56:15,557
worth considering.

1052
00:56:15,557 --> 00:56:15,617
Hi.

1053
00:56:15,617 --> 00:56:19,660
So given the delta of utility in a game where one person wins and everybody else loses,

1054
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:20,481
obviously, the net...

1055
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:44,088
penis, I don't know what the word for that is, is like seriously negative.

1056
00:56:44,839 --> 00:56:47,381
Do you have any thoughts on designing games where,

1057
00:56:47,381 --> 00:56:49,183
even though maybe they're still like a winner,

1058
00:56:49,183 --> 00:56:51,364
because yeah, it's fun to win,

1059
00:56:51,364 --> 00:56:53,847
people don't necessarily feel that sense of negativity

1060
00:56:53,847 --> 00:56:55,788
in the same way or like it balances out a bit more?

1061
00:56:55,788 --> 00:56:58,090
I mean, I think that when it's balanced

1062
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:00,152
so that people feel like they almost won

1063
00:57:00,152 --> 00:57:02,454
or they could have won or they were close to winning,

1064
00:57:02,454 --> 00:57:03,134
definitely helps.

1065
00:57:03,134 --> 00:57:04,836
And then you have like, I mean, it's the same with co-op.

1066
00:57:04,836 --> 00:57:07,117
Like if you're beating the system in pandemic

1067
00:57:07,117 --> 00:57:09,499
and you get only so far and then the game destroys you,

1068
00:57:09,499 --> 00:57:10,820
that just doesn't feel very good.

1069
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:13,523
But if you get pretty far and you feel like you could have.

1070
00:57:14,016 --> 00:57:17,318
maybe won that, or if you only did a few things,

1071
00:57:17,318 --> 00:57:20,320
you could have passed it or maybe beat it,

1072
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,321
then you have that sense of happiness,

1073
00:57:22,321 --> 00:57:24,082
or at least engagement in terms of the,

1074
00:57:24,082 --> 00:57:25,303
like, next time I go in it,

1075
00:57:25,303 --> 00:57:27,104
I can totally beat this kind of sense.

1076
00:57:27,104 --> 00:57:27,364
Yeah.

1077
00:57:27,364 --> 00:57:29,666
The MSs tend to feel better to players, you think?

1078
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:30,006
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

1079
00:57:30,006 --> 00:57:33,168
Yeah, definitely. That's great.

1080
00:57:33,168 --> 00:57:34,689
And I think that's part of the thing

1081
00:57:34,689 --> 00:57:36,930
that I was trying to talk about, the balancing, right?

1082
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:39,352
You don't want, it's so unequal where one person

1083
00:57:39,352 --> 00:57:41,133
just blows everybody else out of the water,

1084
00:57:41,133 --> 00:57:41,813
because then it's like...

1085
00:57:42,151 --> 00:57:44,152
Well, you know, it's also for entertainment too.

1086
00:57:44,152 --> 00:57:46,553
If you're watching a soccer match and it's like 10 to zero,

1087
00:57:46,553 --> 00:57:48,574
it's no longer fun to watch the soccer match.

1088
00:57:48,574 --> 00:57:50,014
There's nothing engaging about it.

1089
00:57:50,014 --> 00:57:56,477
Thank you very much.

1090
00:57:56,477 --> 00:57:58,558
All right, well, thank you guys.
