1
00:00:03,106 --> 00:00:13,088
the world. Welcome everyone to

2
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:14,148
Game Developers Conference.

3
00:00:14,288 --> 00:00:16,989
2022 Great to be together.

4
00:00:17,169 --> 00:00:19,149
Virtually This panel is build

5
00:00:19,169 --> 00:00:20,730
your career in games like it's

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,330
an RPG. Um a lot of people

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,410
think about their careers in a

8
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,291
little bit weird.

9
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,762
We're going to talk today a bit about how to take the road less traveled and meander

10
00:00:37,802 --> 00:00:40,844
onto new areas of the map and take a side quest or two.

11
00:00:41,785 --> 00:00:43,326
So first, let's introduce the panelists.

12
00:00:43,346 --> 00:00:46,848
So I'm Gordon Bellamy, full professor, USC Games

13
00:00:47,408 --> 00:00:50,890
and CEO of Gay Gaming Professionals and in some direction.

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,551
Hey, Anne, who are you?

15
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:55,272
Hi, I'm Angie Bo.

16
00:00:55,372 --> 00:00:59,296
I'm product head and creative director right now at Phoenix Labs Montreal.

17
00:01:00,457 --> 00:01:05,321
I started in the industry around 20 years ago as a 3D animator,

18
00:01:05,642 --> 00:01:09,185
and I went through lots of different careers and paths

19
00:01:09,385 --> 00:01:11,927
to get to to being a creative director right now.

20
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:15,270
Welcome, Anne. How about you, Connie?

21
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:22,043
Yes, I'm Connie Griffith and I am content lead on State of Decay 3 over at Undead Labs.

22
00:01:22,744 --> 00:01:31,211
And yeah, I've been in the industry, this is going on my 19th year and I got my start as a QA tester

23
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,394
on World of Warcraft the first time it launched. And I've...

24
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:40,448
done a lot of things, but I've ended up as a designer

25
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:43,031
focusing on storytelling experiences.

26
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:47,916
But in my as I'm sure we'll explore on the panel, I've been a producer.

27
00:01:47,996 --> 00:01:48,997
I've been a game writer.

28
00:01:49,097 --> 00:01:50,399
I've done business development.

29
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:54,723
And so I'm happy to be here and share my experiences with everyone.

30
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:58,027
Welcome, Connie. And hello, Brian.

31
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:00,191
Hey, thanks for having me.

32
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:01,892
Yeah, I'm Brian Corrigan.

33
00:02:02,092 --> 00:02:05,233
I'm the head of Americas for Krafton PUBG.

34
00:02:05,394 --> 00:02:06,834
Probably most people know better by PUBG.

35
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,576
I do a little bit of work with Convoy Ventures,

36
00:02:10,616 --> 00:02:12,196
which is a venture capital company.

37
00:02:12,276 --> 00:02:13,537
So investing and advising.

38
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:17,619
I got my career started out a long time ago

39
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:19,739
working on Guitar Hero 3 networking services,

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,900
actually as an engineer.

41
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,821
And kind of just like Anne said,

42
00:02:23,861 --> 00:02:26,282
we've my way through a weird past to get where I am today.

43
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:31,978
and last and most special thanks to you, Jing, for bringing us together.

44
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:34,720
First and foremost, was going to be possible as a conversation.

45
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,322
But also, please introduce yourself.

46
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:38,983
Hey, I'm Jing.

47
00:02:39,383 --> 00:02:42,846
Most recently, I was a general manager at Phoenix Labs

48
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:45,688
heading up their L.A. and Bay Area studios.

49
00:02:46,168 --> 00:02:49,050
That was a very strategy and operations focused role.

50
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,972
But I actually got my start in games in.

51
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,275
branding and marketing first working with Nintendo and then at Riot Games.

52
00:02:56,736 --> 00:02:59,598
And then during my time at Riot, I started to look for ways to expand

53
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:04,142
my skill set further and took an opportunity to join the merchandising team,

54
00:03:04,422 --> 00:03:05,723
which was forming up at the time.

55
00:03:06,223 --> 00:03:07,985
So through that experience got like.

56
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:16,911
a tour through everything from apparel development to web platform to global channel management,

57
00:03:17,371 --> 00:03:23,355
e-commerce events, player support, all of that. And then after that, I went on an adventure with

58
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:28,239
a couple of engineering friends where we started an educational game startup. And then a little

59
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:33,963
ways down the road, Phoenix Labs acquired our studio and then I worked on special projects.

60
00:03:35,043 --> 00:03:36,565
before taking on the GM role.

61
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:39,427
So I've gotten, I kind of gotten to experience a lot

62
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:41,688
of interesting stuff on the business

63
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,969
and product side of games.

64
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:45,791
And right now I'm focusing on some personal projects

65
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:49,354
that let me delve into the art, design

66
00:03:49,454 --> 00:03:52,977
and engineering aspects of games and technology.

67
00:03:53,177 --> 00:03:56,079
And I've loved having a multi-class career.

68
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:58,601
It's been such a continuous journey of learning and growing.

69
00:03:58,641 --> 00:04:01,143
And I'm so excited to speak with all of you today.

70
00:04:02,386 --> 00:04:06,669
Wow. I just as I think about it, wow, it's like over 100 years of experience,

71
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:14,335
all these max level characters. But that's not where this RPG began. Right. So just taking

72
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:20,480
your metaphor back a bit. We understand where you're at, but let's talk about how you began.

73
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,724
Let's let's visualize your character sheet as it were. Let's talk a little bit about that and

74
00:04:25,764 --> 00:04:29,787
maybe go into like an origin story. So Connie, take us in. Where were you?

75
00:04:30,635 --> 00:04:33,537
10 years ago, like where were you thinking about what you dream of?

76
00:04:33,557 --> 00:04:35,038
Paint us all a picture.

77
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,919
Oh, wow. OK.

78
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:42,201
10 years ago, it's actually like the midpoint, so not quite an origin story.

79
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:45,783
But I would say baby Connie did not know what baby Connie wanted,

80
00:04:46,023 --> 00:04:50,045
which I don't think is that unusual for a lot of folks.

81
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:54,287
That was the first time that I hit reset on my career.

82
00:04:55,188 --> 00:04:57,069
I was having a bit of a quarter life crisis.

83
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,811
I'd previously done sort of like business development.

84
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:03,372
I was an executive assistant.

85
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:04,932
I was doing production.

86
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:08,033
I'd only worked for one studio at that time, which was Blizzard.

87
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:12,315
And I just came to this realization that even though I was working

88
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:15,557
for my dream company and, you know, people were telling me,

89
00:05:15,577 --> 00:05:17,157
oh, you're doing a great job, you're awesome.

90
00:05:18,357 --> 00:05:21,624
I realized I really, I really wasn't very happy.

91
00:05:21,644 --> 00:05:23,809
In fact, I was very unhappy.

92
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,975
And that was a very hard thing for me

93
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:29,280
to sort of struggle with because

94
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:32,916
you know, when you're successful

95
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:34,597
and you're climbing your career ladder

96
00:05:34,637 --> 00:05:36,477
and you're going, no, no, this is where I belong.

97
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:38,258
And I think I originally just had a hard time

98
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:40,599
where I never even saw myself in games.

99
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:41,699
I loved video games.

100
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,900
I just didn't know I wasn't a programmer.

101
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,301
I wasn't an artist, right?

102
00:05:46,921 --> 00:05:48,442
I was like, what exactly could I do?

103
00:05:48,562 --> 00:05:52,503
And so that's kind of why I fell into sort of production.

104
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:53,583
I was like, oh, that I can do.

105
00:05:53,784 --> 00:05:54,964
I'm good with people, right?

106
00:05:55,384 --> 00:05:57,125
People like me, I can do this job.

107
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:57,985
I can contribute.

108
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:01,788
But I think that was the source of my unhappiness, which I

109
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:06,231
didn't sort of internalize until later, was that I actually was

110
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:08,233
creative that I actually wanted to

111
00:06:09,522 --> 00:06:10,843
go and make games of my own.

112
00:06:10,863 --> 00:06:13,345
I didn't want to just run meetings and take notes

113
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:16,847
and help people organize their work and schedule stuff.

114
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:19,689
I still, it's funny because I've gone full circle

115
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:21,710
where I do a lot of the facilitation work

116
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,733
that I did 10 years ago, but it's different, right?

117
00:06:25,913 --> 00:06:27,974
And I think 10 years ago is when I.

118
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:31,640
basically decided to leave Blizzard.

119
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,983
I'd been there for eight years and I started over as a game writer.

120
00:06:37,644 --> 00:06:40,265
And that that's kind of my origin story on my path

121
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:44,027
to pursuing being on the other side of the fence for game development.

122
00:06:45,148 --> 00:06:45,888
That's fantastic.

123
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:50,591
I think along this path, we've all found that moment

124
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:54,714
of where it's time to start being the game industry versus

125
00:06:55,274 --> 00:06:57,055
exploring the opportunity that was given to us.

126
00:06:57,595 --> 00:06:58,556
Maybe, Jing.

127
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:03,454
Can you talk about a point when you knew you wanted to make a major change?

128
00:07:03,754 --> 00:07:07,695
Those are born out of you, not just the opportunities provided to you.

129
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:09,196
Yeah, absolutely.

130
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:14,197
So about seven, eight years into.

131
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:16,818
So I started off in marketing and branding, right?

132
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:19,899
And so I kind of had experienced a lot in that realm.

133
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,160
And I had been about seven or eight years into my career there.

134
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,762
And I remember having a conversation with one of my mentors at the time.

135
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:31,514
And he asked me the typical question of,

136
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,795
hey, where do you see yourself in five, 10 years?

137
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,616
Like, what do you see yourself doing?

138
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,498
And I realized at that moment, a couple of things.

139
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:44,159
One, that I didn't see myself.

140
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,705
continuing to do marketing and branding as kind of my day-to-day, everyday focus.

141
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:57,071
And the second was that I couldn't exactly put words to an exact title or role. Instead,

142
00:07:57,091 --> 00:08:00,934
I just, as I thought about it,

143
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:08,500
All I really wanted was to make sure that whatever was ahead of me in the future, I felt like I had

144
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:15,204
a high degree of confidence that I would be an asset to my team, that I'd be able to tackle

145
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:19,747
any kind of problem, learn anything, learn any role that I wanted to learn. And

146
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:23,731
this desire to be endlessly useful.

147
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:26,494
And I wanted to be this kind of Swiss army knife

148
00:08:26,654 --> 00:08:29,456
of different skills and be of course,

149
00:08:29,497 --> 00:08:31,138
very proud of the things that I've worked on

150
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:34,942
and proud of the effect that I have on the team around me.

151
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,504
And so the moment that I realized

152
00:08:37,544 --> 00:08:38,846
that I just didn't have like a,

153
00:08:39,406 --> 00:08:47,392
particular thing or role in mind and instead wanted to build this multifaceted skill set,

154
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:53,396
it really opened up the way I thought about what do I want to do next and it became less like I

155
00:08:53,556 --> 00:09:00,641
felt myself getting off of like the the career ladder and instead looking across the different

156
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:04,443
kind of branches of skill trees that I could be developing in and looking at where do I want to

157
00:09:04,484 --> 00:09:06,085
double down on existing strengths.

158
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:08,985
where do I want to shore up weaknesses?

159
00:09:09,386 --> 00:09:11,006
And, you know, kind of pointing back

160
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:11,826
to what Connie was saying,

161
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:14,407
like there were also some strength areas

162
00:09:14,707 --> 00:09:16,627
that just because I was good at those things

163
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:19,448
didn't mean that I needed to continue to do that job

164
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:20,468
if it was not going to be a thing

165
00:09:20,488 --> 00:09:22,789
that was going to be fulfilling for me in the longterm.

166
00:09:23,289 --> 00:09:25,330
And so, yeah, I think that moment

167
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:29,031
and that deep introspection about seven, eight years

168
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:32,612
into my career was what set everything else into motion.

169
00:09:32,632 --> 00:09:34,392
That's so interesting.

170
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:36,675
I play a lot of Age of Empires,

171
00:09:36,715 --> 00:09:38,395
so I think a lot about pathfinding,

172
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:42,656
but also what you brought up, which is skill tree, right?

173
00:09:42,736 --> 00:09:45,697
Skill tree is to do like wondrous moments in your career

174
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:50,239
and the steps you take when you have choices to do so.

175
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,220
Let's bring you into the conversation, Brian.

176
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,861
Like, did you always know that you wanted to run a studio?

177
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:00,422
Or where did you make compromises?

178
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:07,203
to get there, like in your skill tree and your in your pathfinding or in your skill tree to get to run a studio.

179
00:10:07,243 --> 00:10:15,108
Yeah, I love that idea you're talking about with skill trees, because, you know, I feel like like you kind of always have to know your character sheet at any time.

180
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:20,872
And I think like sometimes people are not honest about about that.

181
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:24,795
You know, you kind of have this idea of who you are, but only you can't always get it by looking in the mirror.

182
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:27,216
Right. You have to have friends who you can talk to and who.

183
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:32,661
you can kind of be honest about to tell you maybe what you're good at and what you're missing.

184
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:38,328
And for me, it was always about the entrepreneurship side.

185
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:39,510
I always knew I wanted to.

186
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:45,606
I'd be an entrepreneur. My dad was an entrepreneur. My grandfather was an entrepreneur. I just

187
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:50,869
had it in me as a kid. And I went to school for computer engineering, got out of school

188
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:55,773
and got a job at a casino company. I don't know anything about gambling. Don't like gambling.

189
00:10:56,373 --> 00:10:57,454
Don't know anything about it at all.

190
00:10:58,294 --> 00:11:01,877
But I knew eventually, at some point in my life, I kind of wanted to run my own company.

191
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:05,239
So I was looking at my skill sheet and saying, what could I bring?

192
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,220
Maybe I'm a half-decent programmer.

193
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:11,683
First thing is learn to be a manager or leader.

194
00:11:11,783 --> 00:11:15,126
So I spent some time with that and I knew that was a deficit for me.

195
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:19,008
So early on, that's what I tried to learn a little bit and find good people to look

196
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:19,389
up to.

197
00:11:20,449 --> 00:11:24,412
And as you get older, you just kind of find like, well, these things that you're spending

198
00:11:24,432 --> 00:11:27,574
your time thinking about, all of a sudden, are these things that you kind of end up doing.

199
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:33,463
Um, and I think like, you know, eventually it kind of got to be that point where it was like,

200
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:37,484
well, if I'm going to do this, there's no better time. You know, we were thinking about having

201
00:11:37,544 --> 00:11:42,426
kids and, and that sort of thing. Um, and you know, so the folks on the call know, but, uh,

202
00:11:42,526 --> 00:11:46,507
I live in upstate New York, which is not exactly known to be like the Mecca of,

203
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:49,768
of game development that like, you know, LA or Seattle or.

204
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:55,424
Austin or Montreal for sure with Anne. For sure, Montreal, right?

205
00:11:57,047 --> 00:11:59,513
So, for me, it was like, well, if I want to get into the industry

206
00:12:00,054 --> 00:12:01,316
and I want to kind of be an entrepreneur,

207
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:05,605
you know, the idea of like going out and starting your own game studio and making games, it

208
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:07,226
just really wouldn't happen.

209
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:08,406
I mean, the funding wasn't there.

210
00:12:08,446 --> 00:12:09,487
I didn't have the experience.

211
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:15,589
So I tried to leverage the skill that I thought I had, which was, you know, this, you know,

212
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:19,431
knowledge of like backend and kind of big data systems like cloud.

213
00:12:19,491 --> 00:12:20,252
This was brand new.

214
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:26,534
And so I kind of started a contract studio around bringing games kind of like into the

215
00:12:26,554 --> 00:12:27,335
cloud and online.

216
00:12:27,475 --> 00:12:30,956
This was the same time that the Xbox was kind of like just coming online.

217
00:12:31,942 --> 00:12:36,764
And I was lucky enough to have one of the first games I worked on be Guitar Hero with a local

218
00:12:36,804 --> 00:12:42,025
studio, the only local studio here called Vicarious Visions. They're amazing. And I don't

219
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:45,926
know why they trusted us. They shouldn't, but we worked really hard and I think we did a good job.

220
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:52,588
And yeah, kind of leveraged that later into a few more steps. But eventually I did get to where I

221
00:12:52,628 --> 00:12:56,870
wanted, which was to run my own studio. So I kind of always had the dream of being an entrepreneur,

222
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,650
but it's just a little...

223
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:03,254
It's tough to sometimes see that far ahead, knowing how much you have to do.

224
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:07,197
But, you know, I did my best that I did make it so.

225
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:09,058
Well, that's so cool.

226
00:13:09,178 --> 00:13:13,081
I mean, so, Brian, you just spoke very powerfully to like the

227
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:16,984
your internal sense, your internal truth, right, would prove it for it,

228
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,226
but also listening to the world around you

229
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:23,749
to recognize what might be special in relationship to others.

230
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,692
Let's bring and into the conversation and I've known you for a lifetime.

231
00:13:28,352 --> 00:13:31,074
I do a number through a number of roles and evolutions.

232
00:13:31,414 --> 00:13:36,517
However, there is a truth or dare I say it, transformer spark inside of you.

233
00:13:36,537 --> 00:13:42,500
When did you like discover, you know, the truth, like that

234
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,062
you were going to be in games and this is what you want to bring to the table?

235
00:13:46,422 --> 00:13:50,185
Will that be sort of in your heart, like just in your bones like Brian spoke up?

236
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:54,820
or in your relationship with others, like your spark that would be true

237
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,423
no matter what the role is going forward.

238
00:13:57,783 --> 00:13:58,444
I like humans.

239
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:03,530
I always like human interactions and building something together

240
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,214
as a team is always the most important thing.

241
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:11,519
whatever the role, whatever the position, whatever the project is,

242
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,861
the people you work with at the end, that is important.

243
00:14:13,921 --> 00:14:19,065
So the path I had, I worked for like over 11 years at Ubisoft Montreal,

244
00:14:19,085 --> 00:14:20,947
which is a very big studio.

245
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:24,630
There's always at least 17 projects going on at the same time.

246
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:29,034
So the opportunities of doing whatever is there,

247
00:14:29,194 --> 00:14:31,436
if you have certain skills, of course, I couldn't.

248
00:14:32,462 --> 00:14:34,764
claim myself being I want to be a programmer tomorrow.

249
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:36,666
So I don't have those skills.

250
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:41,491
But in terms of management and, you know, like video game

251
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:43,313
development for me is a second career.

252
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:44,654
I went back to school at 30.

253
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:48,698
So it gives you my age. I'm over 50 now.

254
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:50,080
It's a second career.

255
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,262
So before that, I manage people.

256
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:53,723
I discovered a lot of things.

257
00:14:53,763 --> 00:14:55,846
I worked in music stores and I worked in.

258
00:14:56,366 --> 00:15:02,429
in survey on the phone and I did tons of crappy jobs before this. So for me,

259
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:10,893
game dev, whatever the role, it's like, wow, okay, I'm ready to go to Mars or wherever you're

260
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:15,796
going to send me. I'm just happy to be there surrounded by wonderful people working on games,

261
00:15:15,816 --> 00:15:21,219
you know? So for me at the start being a 3D animator, it was the craft itself that I really,

262
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,401
really enjoyed. I really love the craft of animating in 3D.

263
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:31,697
But very rapidly, like the second project, people at Ubisoft Montreal said,

264
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:36,879
you know what, we think you're ready to be a manager about a team of animation.

265
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:38,600
I said, OK, I'm going to try it out.

266
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,062
So I kind of stopped animating after only like two years.

267
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:48,305
It's this little like sad thing about dropping the animation.

268
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:50,026
But I discovered so many much.

269
00:15:50,687 --> 00:15:56,596
more things. And I did discover along the way that, OK, people are important.

270
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:59,460
Like this is key. It's still true today.

271
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:07,224
But what do I bring over being able to work with people and being good to work with people?

272
00:16:07,544 --> 00:16:09,725
What can I bring to the to the table right now?

273
00:16:09,765 --> 00:16:15,968
And I want to work on product and I want to I want to invest myself in doing amazing games.

274
00:16:16,048 --> 00:16:22,691
So like I said, the question you asked, Eugene, like what made a change like ten years ago?

275
00:16:23,861 --> 00:16:27,085
For me, 10 years ago, it's when I took the decision.

276
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:30,870
I actually stopped working in the games industry for about six months.

277
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:38,219
I wanted to write a novel, a sci-fi novel, and I just stopped working for six months.

278
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:43,611
I created this universe, the context, the characters about that novel and started

279
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:47,334
talking about it to some friends that most of them are working in a game industry.

280
00:16:47,754 --> 00:16:50,396
So they were telling me, ah, forget about the novel.

281
00:16:50,456 --> 00:16:51,517
Just do a game about it.

282
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:52,297
We're in.

283
00:16:52,357 --> 00:16:54,138
If you start your own company, I'm in.

284
00:16:54,219 --> 00:16:55,479
And it's like this.

285
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,741
A year after that, we started our own studio.

286
00:16:57,841 --> 00:17:03,525
And from there, it's I'm way more into gaming than I was like 10 years ago.

287
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:08,220
Wow, that's the spark if you're not getting it,

288
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,222
you're getting it now, the spark, right?

289
00:17:11,062 --> 00:17:12,063
I ask great questions.

290
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,005
I wanna bring it back to you, Connie,

291
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:17,106
you sort of take us down this path as RPG.

292
00:17:17,626 --> 00:17:20,088
I want people to have specificity, right?

293
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,270
So I want to take us to the moment, okay?

294
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:28,213
Like what for you was the critical point, okay?

295
00:17:29,554 --> 00:17:33,636
When you really were what you wanted changed,

296
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:33,877
like...

297
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:39,206
take us into detail. We know that it moves, but what was the moment when you're like,

298
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:47,589
this is the change, it's happening going forward? Oh man. Okay. So,

299
00:17:52,218 --> 00:17:56,120
There is so much in that question, and I'm going to try hard not to like

300
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,761
tear up on camera because this is a deeply emotional question for me.

301
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:06,163
I think it's for everyone, because we all know being in games is very hard, right?

302
00:18:06,203 --> 00:18:12,544
This industry is not always kind to everyone. And

303
00:18:13,145 --> 00:18:15,105
I mean, OK, so first and foremost, I have.

304
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:23,877
I got into this industry because of the people and I stayed here because of the people and I continue to be here because.

305
00:18:23,897 --> 00:18:31,399
I just love the people in games, I love the people I work with, I love the people that I get to meet,

306
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:39,281
and it's just when you when you meet other folks that love to play and make games,

307
00:18:39,961 --> 00:18:44,843
there's just this instant connection about problem solving and creativity and so that is a huge.

308
00:18:45,745 --> 00:18:51,371
spark for me. I've actually tried to leave games at least twice, and it's not been entirely

309
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:57,337
successful, but this is sort of a personal story where, so I lost my first husband to cancer,

310
00:18:58,278 --> 00:19:03,364
and at one point when he was still fighting his cancer, we were

311
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,741
We had to fly to Germany to get treatment.

312
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,104
It was a procedure that's not approved here in the United States.

313
00:19:10,144 --> 00:19:11,144
It's like laser resection.

314
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:14,667
There's one hospital in rural Germany, right,

315
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:16,448
where they do this.

316
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:17,489
And we're sitting there.

317
00:19:17,709 --> 00:19:20,431
It's a tiny hospital in the middle of like these woods.

318
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:27,513
And there was a teenage boy from Finland sitting next to us.

319
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:31,774
And my husband, who is an artist, he was an artist at Blizzard.

320
00:19:31,814 --> 00:19:33,534
And so he was just sketching different things.

321
00:19:33,594 --> 00:19:37,095
And this kid looks over and both him and his parents, you know, their English was

322
00:19:37,255 --> 00:19:38,515
was was OK, right?

323
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:39,696
And they just go over.

324
00:19:39,756 --> 00:19:42,956
And this kid, his eyes just light up. Right.

325
00:19:43,296 --> 00:19:46,037
And him, my husband had the same rare cancer.

326
00:19:46,057 --> 00:19:49,218
They bonded. My husband drew things for him.

327
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:50,058
And I think.

328
00:19:52,473 --> 00:19:55,175
That was the moment when I was like, we do more than make games.

329
00:19:58,578 --> 00:19:59,118
Absolutely.

330
00:19:59,518 --> 00:20:03,001
We we we sorry we connect people.

331
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:05,743
We give.

332
00:20:07,485 --> 00:20:09,726
We give people a shared.

333
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:11,988
Thing to love.

334
00:20:15,011 --> 00:20:15,951
Right. Yeah, well, that's

335
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:18,493
well, wow.

336
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:20,910
Thank you for trusting and sharing with us Connie.

337
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:22,311
That was beautiful.

338
00:20:22,551 --> 00:20:23,472
And meaningful. Thank you.

339
00:20:26,154 --> 00:20:41,187
I want to, I want to also return to what and what you were saying, because you were sort of alluding to a moment for you it felt like when your community rallied around you and said, and we are down, you know, to work with you, but that sort of propelled

340
00:20:41,227 --> 00:20:45,150
you forward into the next phase of your career. So maybe.

341
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,371
Talk about.

342
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:51,938
that group, your party, right? That group that you were running those dungeons with who were like,

343
00:20:52,139 --> 00:21:00,164
who showed up, right, as they could to be with you. Yeah, talk about that experience

344
00:21:00,745 --> 00:21:04,007
when they came together and then you turn that into professional action.

345
00:21:06,205 --> 00:21:19,864
Actually, I think that the people I talked to about this project kind of had a similar path and a similar delusion, maybe, about the industry and working in a big, big, huge,

346
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:26,995
structure to make games, like when you're like 500, like my artistic director, it's not mine,

347
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:34,498
but the artistic director at Epsilon Games, Nancy, was a great character modeler. She was

348
00:21:34,518 --> 00:21:41,880
a lead character modeler at that time at Ubisoft, but she was working mainly on Excel sheets.

349
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,121
managing the team, making the 3D models.

350
00:21:45,381 --> 00:21:48,902
And after a few years, it was that kind of decision

351
00:21:48,962 --> 00:21:53,043
that everybody had to make, like I'm good at what I'm doing at the craft.

352
00:21:54,124 --> 00:21:56,384
And now I'm becoming only a manager.

353
00:21:56,784 --> 00:21:58,605
Is that really what I want to do?

354
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:00,826
Some people, yes, and it's OK to be a manager.

355
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:01,746
I was a manager for.

356
00:22:02,959 --> 00:22:04,601
15 years in the games industry.

357
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:06,982
So it's totally OK. It's not a judgment, but it's just

358
00:22:07,103 --> 00:22:11,045
it's just a personal decision at one point saying like, OK, I started

359
00:22:11,106 --> 00:22:13,227
as a craft woman or a craft man.

360
00:22:13,848 --> 00:22:16,390
And now what do I do? Do I manage people? Do I?

361
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:24,177
become a better HR person because a manager involves a lot managing people, not only tasks

362
00:22:24,257 --> 00:22:29,081
and projects. So it's a question of, you know, of decision and where you want to go. And

363
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:35,486
do I still want to continue on that path for like the next 10 years, 15 years, 20 years?

364
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:42,532
So the people I was talking to were like all over 35 and were in the industry for about 15 years.

365
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:42,692
And

366
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:48,685
The idea of let's make a game together.

367
00:22:48,765 --> 00:22:52,648
We're going to be maximum 10 because we don't have any resources.

368
00:22:52,728 --> 00:22:54,108
So we're going to be poor.

369
00:22:54,569 --> 00:22:58,511
Are you OK about being poor for the next like three years

370
00:22:58,591 --> 00:23:02,034
and make the game that we want to make and have fun at least?

371
00:23:03,014 --> 00:23:05,335
And they gave it a shot.

372
00:23:05,555 --> 00:23:11,498
And I'm I'm I'm so humbled about that because it was a bumpy road.

373
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:16,441
It was not all, you know, like very happy people every day.

374
00:23:16,481 --> 00:23:17,142
That's for sure.

375
00:23:17,482 --> 00:23:21,664
The stress level of having to pay for your mortgage and everything

376
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:24,746
and not money coming in and, you know, all those things.

377
00:23:24,846 --> 00:23:28,308
It's kind of the stress was intense, but I would never.

378
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:35,155
go back and not redo it. I would redo it like in a heartbeat because this experience actually

379
00:23:35,876 --> 00:23:41,422
today if I'm in this position at Phoenix Lab it's because I did that and I do understand

380
00:23:41,902 --> 00:23:47,027
what it is to start a studio and to have people and to inspire people.

381
00:23:47,688 --> 00:23:53,550
and going on board and it's going to work and we're going to do it together and we're doing it together.

382
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,371
So for me, this experience is like it's key.

383
00:23:56,431 --> 00:24:05,995
And and I'm again, I'm really I'm really touched that my associates and the employees that we had all decided to jump at the same time.

384
00:24:06,055 --> 00:24:08,796
We were in the same position, actually in the same mind space and.

385
00:24:10,136 --> 00:24:15,682
They all said, and now nobody is working like as a freelancer or they own the studio.

386
00:24:15,883 --> 00:24:18,526
We're all back in bigger structure.

387
00:24:19,914 --> 00:24:26,599
What we learned in those years that we went together, it's enormous and nobody regrets.

388
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:30,682
And we were all in the same headspace at that time saying like, let's try it.

389
00:24:31,082 --> 00:24:36,166
We won't try it when we're like 65, 35, 40. It's the, let's do it right now.

390
00:24:36,566 --> 00:24:41,390
And just the last thing, I give classes to a university in Montreal,

391
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:44,252
Design and Animation University. And I tell the students, it's like,

392
00:24:44,972 --> 00:24:50,033
If ever you're feeling a little entrepreneur and you really want to start a game,

393
00:24:50,153 --> 00:24:53,414
if you live at your parents' house, now is the time.

394
00:24:53,794 --> 00:24:55,894
You don't have kids. You don't have anything to pay.

395
00:24:56,715 --> 00:24:58,035
Do it. Do it now.

396
00:24:58,115 --> 00:25:00,535
Take two, three years. Do the game you want to do.

397
00:25:00,855 --> 00:25:02,096
It's the good timing.

398
00:25:03,996 --> 00:25:06,257
Wow. And I'm just going to invite you now

399
00:25:06,277 --> 00:25:08,937
because we have a new fine arts program games at USC

400
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:12,318
and you are my first invitee.

401
00:25:12,997 --> 00:25:14,177
But that's not what we're talking about today.

402
00:25:14,197 --> 00:25:19,040
I want to, you were born into this cauldron of development,

403
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,901
this hub in Montreal,

404
00:25:21,982 --> 00:25:24,203
thousands of people making games together.

405
00:25:24,663 --> 00:25:29,266
Brian, you were in the heartland of America, okay?

406
00:25:29,686 --> 00:25:33,108
In upstate New York, probably, you know,

407
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:35,850
not a stone's throw from your next developer.

408
00:25:37,251 --> 00:25:39,732
How did you find your guild, right?

409
00:25:39,812 --> 00:25:41,513
In a very, very different setting.

410
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:42,992
than where I am.

411
00:25:44,032 --> 00:25:45,153
Yeah, it was really tough.

412
00:25:46,854 --> 00:25:47,954
You know, and especially early,

413
00:25:48,054 --> 00:25:49,075
it's not like, you know,

414
00:25:49,095 --> 00:25:49,695
we're all playing.

415
00:25:50,656 --> 00:25:52,877
You know, multiplayer games together.

416
00:25:52,897 --> 00:25:54,077
I mean, I guess we were

417
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:54,978
actually to some degree

418
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:56,398
just just older games.

419
00:25:57,899 --> 00:25:59,960
But, you know, it's like.

420
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:04,809
I always kind of picture that like little scene from Zelda where it says it's dangerous to go it alone.

421
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:06,329
Like you have to have this team.

422
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:12,552
And I think for me, anyway, like slowly kind of over the years, you know, you meet like minded people.

423
00:26:13,652 --> 00:26:15,533
And, you know, these days, you know.

424
00:26:16,554 --> 00:26:20,295
I play games with a lot of people online that I've just been friends with over the years.

425
00:26:20,675 --> 00:26:24,317
And, you know, I think I think we kind of have this like built in advantage

426
00:26:24,377 --> 00:26:27,958
because we make things that we love and we love them forever.

427
00:26:28,138 --> 00:26:29,779
I mean, you know, something you work on, it's your art.

428
00:26:30,608 --> 00:26:32,050
And, you know, you kind of want to play it forever.

429
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,852
So, you know, Jing and I were talking the other day and I was saying that,

430
00:26:34,952 --> 00:26:37,715
you know, I still play games with some of the folks that I used to work with

431
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:40,777
at Riot when when her and I first met,

432
00:26:41,678 --> 00:26:43,840
because League of Legends is an amazing game and I absolutely love it.

433
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,322
And we had a lot of fun and it's just like a great way to stay connected.

434
00:26:48,043 --> 00:26:51,346
But I think, yeah, you do kind of collect, you know, these folks over the years.

435
00:26:51,426 --> 00:26:53,828
And this is another great thing about the gaming industry is once

436
00:26:54,328 --> 00:26:56,790
once you kind of like claw your way in a little bit, which I understand

437
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,293
sometimes people think it's a little bit hard to kind of claw your way in.

438
00:27:00,393 --> 00:27:02,395
But once you're in, it's actually really welcoming.

439
00:27:02,695 --> 00:27:04,637
I would say like it's just in general to me anyway.

440
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:07,179
It's always been a really supporting community.

441
00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:07,379
So.

442
00:27:08,591 --> 00:27:14,554
Even those folks that I met all those years ago, 2005, 2006 or whatever it was, like Guitar

443
00:27:14,574 --> 00:27:16,575
Hero, I still talk with a lot of them.

444
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:18,516
Like you said, the area is small.

445
00:27:18,617 --> 00:27:21,618
I actually still work with a few of them.

446
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:24,019
It's been that all these years.

447
00:27:26,802 --> 00:27:30,943
Earlier, you were asking about kind of like route planning and like how people figure out where they want to go.

448
00:27:31,603 --> 00:27:34,084
So like I'm the guy when I play an open world game,

449
00:27:34,104 --> 00:27:37,465
who gets just completely distracted running through the woods, you know, like,

450
00:27:37,505 --> 00:27:41,526
like I'll never get there because I just I love just going off and exploring.

451
00:27:42,446 --> 00:27:46,247
But I think like what makes that fun is, you know, when you're doing it with

452
00:27:46,487 --> 00:27:48,308
with other people, right, it's really fun.

453
00:27:48,348 --> 00:27:50,649
And all those little things just become,

454
00:27:51,249 --> 00:27:53,649
you know, fun moments that you're kind of like hanging out together.

455
00:27:55,165 --> 00:28:00,911
But more specifically, I think, just to give people some good specific action items or whatever on this one,

456
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:08,678
there are a lot of gaming slacks, gaming discords of game developers and people in the game industry.

457
00:28:08,698 --> 00:28:13,882
And there's a bunch I kind of have joined and left a bunch over the years.

458
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:18,026
But there's a couple that I'm in right now that are sort of people that are.

459
00:28:18,993 --> 00:28:23,177
you know, in similar and really different types of jobs around the industry and around

460
00:28:23,197 --> 00:28:23,537
the world.

461
00:28:24,178 --> 00:28:25,319
And that's been really great.

462
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:29,262
You know, just being in there, listening to what people are kind of thinking about and

463
00:28:29,302 --> 00:28:32,505
working on and, you know, watching people talk about news.

464
00:28:32,966 --> 00:28:36,990
I think you just get more from like a Discord or Slack than you really do on Twitter because

465
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:41,274
you don't have that, you know, built-in like megaphone effect that you get on Twitter where

466
00:28:41,294 --> 00:28:42,395
everyone's just kind of shouting.

467
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:43,195
So...

468
00:28:44,744 --> 00:28:48,908
you know, like specifically, you know, some of the, the discords and slacks, I mean, have

469
00:28:48,948 --> 00:28:54,392
been, you know, absolutely incredible. And when I meet people, you know, I just met Connie

470
00:28:54,412 --> 00:28:57,735
for the first time last week, but asked her the same thing, you know, what, where, where

471
00:28:57,755 --> 00:29:01,719
do you hang out when you're online and you're locked in your house, you're in your work

472
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,142
Slack, you know, do you, do you have anything else? And so we were sort of trading links

473
00:29:05,362 --> 00:29:09,705
for stuff like that. But I definitely would recommend that everybody, you know, find something,

474
00:29:09,725 --> 00:29:12,168
whether it's the IGDA, you know, local IGDA group.

475
00:29:12,868 --> 00:29:19,011
or colleges have groups. Somehow I sneak secretly snuck into the Stanford games mailing list. I

476
00:29:19,031 --> 00:29:23,513
didn't go to Stanford, just to be clear. Somehow I snuck on it. So if anyone's watching, please

477
00:29:23,533 --> 00:29:27,795
don't kick me off. But there's things like that I think that are really good and definitely

478
00:29:27,855 --> 00:29:32,298
recommend everybody find a couple of these things and just kind of join up and try to

479
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:37,680
contribute a little bit. Awesome. It's funny. You remind me of Elder Scrolls.

480
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:40,254
I remember turning it on and just running off into the woods.

481
00:29:40,434 --> 00:29:41,354
I didn't know there was a whole game.

482
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,734
I just heard you got to play on this world.

483
00:29:42,914 --> 00:29:46,135
And I just ran off in the woods and never began the original quest for like

484
00:29:46,715 --> 00:29:51,796
two days because I didn't know maybe I was still in that game.

485
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:54,377
I was like, what are you sure that game was the worst?

486
00:29:54,757 --> 00:29:58,938
But I digress before I think it's too far down a side, but to my own.

487
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:02,678
I mean, we're here on this quest because of Jake.

488
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,959
Jake, you brought us together, right?

489
00:30:05,379 --> 00:30:06,839
You assembled us at this this moment.

490
00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:13,288
you know, in your career, could you maybe just frame how you view

491
00:30:14,288 --> 00:30:17,830
networking, trust building, paint as a picture?

492
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,271
Yeah, absolutely.

493
00:30:19,991 --> 00:30:23,653
Actually, I kind of have a little bit of an allergic reaction to the word

494
00:30:24,253 --> 00:30:26,034
networking, because I think that there are so many

495
00:30:29,596 --> 00:30:31,297
more unsavory connotations

496
00:30:31,317 --> 00:30:33,858
because there's something transactional about the concept of networking.

497
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:36,260
But I do think a lot about.

498
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:42,746
building relationships, building really authentic connections with folks and how important that

499
00:30:42,846 --> 00:30:49,492
is both in our industry as a whole, because the games industry is very connected. It can

500
00:30:49,512 --> 00:30:54,797
be very welcoming, very supportive. But also, especially if you're building a

501
00:30:56,098 --> 00:31:02,685
an atypical career, one that doesn't look kind of like others that have already been established,

502
00:31:04,027 --> 00:31:12,476
having a strong support group of your guild, like you put it earlier, Gordon, like having your guilds

503
00:31:12,977 --> 00:31:16,961
and having those relationships be ones that you have.

504
00:31:18,262 --> 00:31:23,347
you know, contributed to grown, cultivated, like really, really grown over the years

505
00:31:23,807 --> 00:31:27,010
helps be able helps you be able to actually navigate through

506
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:33,515
having a more of a multi-class career, because so much of of being able to move

507
00:31:33,575 --> 00:31:37,919
from one role to the other, at least from my experience, has been working

508
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,362
from this already established trust with folks.

509
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:44,845
So in the last, you know, whether it was shifting.

510
00:31:45,665 --> 00:31:49,566
entire disciplines and teams in my time at Riot,

511
00:31:49,887 --> 00:31:56,508
or starting my startup, or ending up at Phoenix Labs,

512
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:58,489
or even the things I was doing within Phoenix Labs,

513
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:01,650
a lot of those would have been infinitely harder,

514
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,390
or not even possible in the first place,

515
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,311
if I didn't already have established trust

516
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:10,152
with some of the key folks along the way.

517
00:32:10,232 --> 00:32:13,513
And so, I'll give you the example of,

518
00:32:14,613 --> 00:32:19,494
with my co-founders, my two co-founders for Bot School,

519
00:32:20,054 --> 00:32:24,456
the three of us had not actually worked directly together

520
00:32:24,496 --> 00:32:27,857
with one another until we started our entrepreneurial journey

521
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:33,138
but we had had years of friendship that had built up

522
00:32:33,478 --> 00:32:35,398
through a combination of just kind of being there

523
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:35,959
for each other.

524
00:32:37,819 --> 00:32:46,126
our CEO at the time, Chris Cobb, he was one of the engineering leads on a team in League

525
00:32:46,146 --> 00:32:50,969
of Legends. And I've worked with his team a couple of times to help them be able to better

526
00:32:51,289 --> 00:32:55,673
tell the story of what Riot and League was trying to do around player behavior.

527
00:32:56,413 --> 00:33:01,277
And through that, we just kind of kept in touch and were a sounding board for one another. And

528
00:33:01,337 --> 00:33:05,060
because of that relationship that had built up over the course of years,

529
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:12,706
when time came to want to go on a founding journey, there was already like, we'd had all those years

530
00:33:12,746 --> 00:33:16,609
of established relationships to be able to go back to and understanding how we worked and how

531
00:33:16,649 --> 00:33:21,873
we could be helping with each other on this journey. And then when I looked at, you know,

532
00:33:21,893 --> 00:33:27,798
putting together this panel, in recent years, I've had, you know, I do some mentorship and

533
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,080
I talk with both folks that are in the games industry and outside of it.

534
00:33:32,641 --> 00:33:38,644
And I've had a lot of folks, you know, reach out when they see kind of the weird career

535
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:42,286
that I've had and want to know more about what it takes to multi-class.

536
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:49,710
And the question had come up enough times in the last few years that when time came

537
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,490
around for GDC this year.

538
00:33:51,957 --> 00:33:58,880
I thought, hey, maybe it'd be good to do a talk around this.

539
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,701
In bringing together the panel,

540
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:05,323
I looked at the really interesting multifaceted folks

541
00:34:05,363 --> 00:34:08,685
that I had encountered in my time in games,

542
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:10,145
which is all of you,

543
00:34:10,586 --> 00:34:14,167
and thought about who else have I encountered along the way

544
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:17,809
that I think would have a really interesting perspective,

545
00:34:18,049 --> 00:34:19,350
who've had these really...

546
00:34:20,151 --> 00:34:25,317
fascinating journeys and have navigated their way through so many different kinds of circumstances,

547
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:33,268
teams, and work on a variety of different types of games, teams, companies. And, you know, I

548
00:34:34,509 --> 00:34:37,653
was really happy that we were able to bring everyone together. So.

549
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:41,796
Yeah, I think, I think, you know, like Brian was saying earlier, like when you,

550
00:34:42,136 --> 00:34:46,918
when you spend time with folks, um, as you encounter them, having those moments

551
00:34:46,998 --> 00:34:51,439
of really authentic connection and continuing to like, take that seed and

552
00:34:51,779 --> 00:34:57,501
cultivate it by, uh, just kind of caring about what other folks are working

553
00:34:57,621 --> 00:34:59,021
on, wanting to support each other.

554
00:34:59,041 --> 00:35:03,782
I think when you have that kind of two way relationship that happens again,

555
00:35:03,963 --> 00:35:06,423
authentically, you know, over the course of.

556
00:35:07,624 --> 00:35:11,185
weeks and months and years, it just,

557
00:35:11,765 --> 00:35:14,206
it makes everything so much brighter and better.

558
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:16,687
No, for sure.

559
00:35:17,627 --> 00:35:19,808
Thank you for putting a framework to this.

560
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,368
And as I sort of think about what you were saying

561
00:35:22,388 --> 00:35:25,609
about authenticity, I think about Anne assembling

562
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:29,011
like these warriors of development in Montreal

563
00:35:29,151 --> 00:35:33,072
and Brian talking about the magic of play together.

564
00:35:33,092 --> 00:35:34,692
I think about you, Connie.

565
00:35:35,293 --> 00:35:35,713
Tell you why.

566
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:38,716
because you're like a paladin, okay?

567
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:42,237
Because you bring together both the magic

568
00:35:42,297 --> 00:35:44,078
of rich game experiences,

569
00:35:44,318 --> 00:35:46,838
but also you're deep in the Seattle community,

570
00:35:47,018 --> 00:35:48,119
this community of all these students

571
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:50,759
where everyone's working and spinning off of like,

572
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,200
you know, Microsoft Bungie and all these studios,

573
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,641
but you have to do it all.

574
00:35:54,941 --> 00:35:57,201
And especially now in these times, right?

575
00:35:57,221 --> 00:35:59,362
Where we've been displaced a little bit, right?

576
00:35:59,382 --> 00:36:01,263
You have to maybe lean a little more into the magic

577
00:36:01,383 --> 00:36:04,263
sometimes than into the physical proximity

578
00:36:04,303 --> 00:36:06,364
and things we share as student experience.

579
00:36:06,616 --> 00:36:10,472
Could you maybe talk about that, Connie, like the life of a paladin?

580
00:36:12,475 --> 00:36:13,936
Yeah, I'm happy to.

581
00:36:14,556 --> 00:36:17,999
So, you know, I actually moved to Seattle in late 2015, 2016,

582
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:21,561
and I actually didn't really know anybody up here.

583
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:24,123
I'd come. This is my first attempt to leave games.

584
00:36:24,163 --> 00:36:28,166
I had gone to work for like a publisher, some startup,

585
00:36:28,226 --> 00:36:31,368
and it ended the way most, you know, startups end.

586
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:36,772
But to really build on what Jing was saying is I really think that.

587
00:36:38,169 --> 00:36:42,072
You know, if you're like baby Connie and don't really know what you want to do,

588
00:36:42,213 --> 00:36:45,756
and you just know that you love games, you want to be part of that magic, right?

589
00:36:45,816 --> 00:36:47,077
And you're not quite sure what to do.

590
00:36:47,097 --> 00:36:49,258
I think the most important thing is to.

591
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,384
You know, build authentic relationships, be sincere, right?

592
00:36:56,104 --> 00:37:00,608
You you you get to enjoy the flowers in the garden that you grow

593
00:37:00,828 --> 00:37:03,851
and how your garden grows is what do you nurture, right?

594
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:07,698
And I think I went from really not knowing anyone other than

595
00:37:07,738 --> 00:37:10,319
like one or two like personal friends up here in Seattle to

596
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:13,120
having a really wonderful network of like professional

597
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:19,381
friends. We're also now personal friends, right? And I think

598
00:37:19,621 --> 00:37:23,062
being willing to ask for help, being willing to put yourself

599
00:37:23,182 --> 00:37:28,784
out there. In Seattle, I can't tell you how many people that I

600
00:37:28,804 --> 00:37:30,785
just ended up becoming good friends with. I was like,

601
00:37:32,233 --> 00:37:34,615
Hey, right, do you wanna grab coffee sometime?

602
00:37:34,955 --> 00:37:37,777
Or, hey, I would really like to chat with you sometime

603
00:37:37,877 --> 00:37:40,398
about some work thing, right?

604
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:42,019
I'm just curious about your thoughts, right?

605
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,260
And I think that's hard there.

606
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,902
Seattle has a bad rep, the Seattle freeze

607
00:37:46,962 --> 00:37:49,843
where people are like cold and talk a lot

608
00:37:49,863 --> 00:37:50,684
about wanting to hang out

609
00:37:50,724 --> 00:37:52,405
but no one ever actually shows up, right?

610
00:37:53,085 --> 00:37:56,087
But even though that's a little bit true, sorry, Seattle,

611
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:58,368
I also think that

612
00:37:59,538 --> 00:38:01,699
If you really want to put yourself out there,

613
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,903
you need to also be willing to just be resilient, right?

614
00:38:07,523 --> 00:38:09,505
I can't tell you how many number of times, right?

615
00:38:09,545 --> 00:38:11,866
Like the connections that I built, where did they start?

616
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:14,208
They just started for me asking someone that.

617
00:38:14,348 --> 00:38:15,548
And not everybody said yes,

618
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:17,690
not everybody was friendly and welcoming, right?

619
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,192
A lot of times, in fact, I would say the majority of time,

620
00:38:20,232 --> 00:38:20,852
it's not personal.

621
00:38:21,052 --> 00:38:23,073
People are busy, people have things that are going on,

622
00:38:23,614 --> 00:38:25,715
right, it's not the right time for you two to connect.

623
00:38:25,735 --> 00:38:25,795
But.

624
00:38:29,587 --> 00:38:35,235
I think having intentionality, having sincerity, wanting to build those authentic relationships

625
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:40,842
and reach out and not being too hard on other people or yourself if somebody says no or

626
00:38:40,882 --> 00:38:45,949
is not there or is not interested in talking, it opens up so many opportunities to learn.

627
00:38:47,031 --> 00:38:48,332
to make new friends.

628
00:38:49,012 --> 00:38:51,875
And I really view it's a side benefit where it's like,

629
00:38:52,055 --> 00:38:54,017
oh, and also we happen to be in the same industry.

630
00:38:54,097 --> 00:38:55,238
And now I have people I can call

631
00:38:55,258 --> 00:38:56,759
if I have questions about things,

632
00:38:56,999 --> 00:38:59,582
or as is often the case,

633
00:38:59,682 --> 00:39:01,804
especially once you get to the leadership level, right?

634
00:39:02,504 --> 00:39:04,106
Having people you can turn to and just go,

635
00:39:04,146 --> 00:39:06,007
look, I have a really challenging problem

636
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:08,069
and I don't know what the right way forward is.

637
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:10,051
And I don't even know that there is a right answer,

638
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:11,272
but I would appreciate

639
00:39:13,482 --> 00:39:15,563
what people's thoughts are and that's vulnerability.

640
00:39:16,183 --> 00:39:17,684
That's opening yourself up, right?

641
00:39:17,724 --> 00:39:19,004
That's talking about your mistakes.

642
00:39:19,084 --> 00:39:21,605
It's talking about that saying, I don't know.

643
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:24,166
I'm in charge and I should know and I don't know.

644
00:39:24,906 --> 00:39:26,107
And, um.

645
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:30,028
You know, it's been true both for rebuilding, right?

646
00:39:30,088 --> 00:39:33,509
My professional network in Seattle, and I think it's true throughout my career,

647
00:39:33,569 --> 00:39:37,171
which is, you know, come up and just ask the worst things.

648
00:39:37,511 --> 00:39:39,231
The worst thing that someone can say is no.

649
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:49,862
So I think so in our careers, there have been at least, I'd say a third revolution.

650
00:39:49,882 --> 00:39:53,845
So for me, the first revolution was online play.

651
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:58,748
OK, the ability to play from my home and connect with friends, colleagues,

652
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:00,990
so on and so forth from my computer.

653
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:04,033
The second one was mobile play.

654
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:07,175
And by that, I meant that play could be with me 24 seven.

655
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:13,312
wherever I was, I could be farming or doing or playing, connecting, chatting,

656
00:40:13,372 --> 00:40:14,053
so on and so forth.

657
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:17,794
I'd offer that we're in the midst of a third revolution.

658
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:21,896
OK, and that third revolution is around video streaming.

659
00:40:23,277 --> 00:40:27,099
And by that, I mean that personally, professionally

660
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:31,001
and both commerce and interaction, video streaming is something now

661
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:35,383
that everyone. Has been a part of, and so.

662
00:40:36,214 --> 00:40:37,555
I want to talk to you, Jing.

663
00:40:37,575 --> 00:40:38,596
I want to talk to you, Brian,

664
00:40:38,616 --> 00:40:40,537
because you just two different perspectives.

665
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:46,060
Jing, I want to talk about like how in this age of remote,

666
00:40:46,241 --> 00:40:51,204
like what sort of new strategies have been helpful to you

667
00:40:51,464 --> 00:40:53,305
to thinking about navigating professionally.

668
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:55,427
And then Brian, while I queue you up here,

669
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,949
I want to talk about it as a profession, like in this craft,

670
00:40:59,029 --> 00:41:01,771
like how has it changed your ability to be a part of games

671
00:41:02,731 --> 00:41:04,172
that video streaming has become a thing?

672
00:41:04,232 --> 00:41:06,013
So let me start with you, Jing.

673
00:41:07,011 --> 00:41:16,355
So I think the remote world that we've been in for the last couple of years has come with a lot of interesting trade-offs.

674
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:29,099
I think in general, we think about continuing to forge connections and building those authentic relationships and like building that sense of community.

675
00:41:30,271 --> 00:41:36,773
in some facets has gotten harder because, you know, you're not able to spend in-person time,

676
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:43,276
you get kind of like less ambient connection and magic that happens between people,

677
00:41:43,596 --> 00:41:49,979
but at the same time, it closes the distance between folks. So, you know, Anne and I are on,

678
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:56,141
you know, opposite sides of the continent from one another, but she and I got to, I think,

679
00:41:56,461 --> 00:42:01,028
have a conversation her first couple of weeks that she was at Phoenix Labs at a time that

680
00:42:01,068 --> 00:42:05,134
worked for both of us. And it was something where we got to talk to one another about

681
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:10,421
our respective journeys. And I got to know her and became friends with her. And that

682
00:42:10,481 --> 00:42:12,364
was a thing that would have been much harder in a time.

683
00:42:13,285 --> 00:42:17,706
before it became so commonplace to be able to have these video calls.

684
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:26,269
I think the other thing that's been really interesting is that with video conferencing,

685
00:42:26,769 --> 00:42:30,710
you get to work together with people and pair with other folks

686
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:35,811
and learn from other folks in a way that just is so much more

687
00:42:37,632 --> 00:42:44,294
so much more deep, you can get more slices of people's actual day-to-day lives as a result.

688
00:42:45,955 --> 00:42:52,237
But going back to what I was saying earlier around the trade-offs, the investment that

689
00:42:52,838 --> 00:42:58,920
an individual has to make in being able to forge those connections goes up higher

690
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,682
because you can't take for granted that you can just run into someone and you can

691
00:43:04,122 --> 00:43:08,804
see them in the office with you, that you can swing by someone's desk.

692
00:43:09,244 --> 00:43:14,106
You know, I used to do this a lot with some of the engineers that I would work with where,

693
00:43:14,126 --> 00:43:20,209
you know, we just get those like 15 minutes of time when we look at a thing together because

694
00:43:20,269 --> 00:43:24,911
I happen to be next to their desk or walking by an artist's desk and seeing the stuff that

695
00:43:24,931 --> 00:43:28,312
they've got posted up on the wall around them and to be able to have those like

696
00:43:28,632 --> 00:43:30,454
five minutes, 10 minutes of exchanges,

697
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,978
those have to be a lot more deliberate now

698
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:37,020
in our current world than they were a few years prior.

699
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:42,566
So I think if you want to forge those relationships,

700
00:43:42,606 --> 00:43:43,667
if you want to cultivate them,

701
00:43:43,847 --> 00:43:45,148
you have to put in a lot more.

702
00:43:46,289 --> 00:43:49,932
direct personal effort and proactiveness toward it.

703
00:43:51,053 --> 00:43:52,194
I think the other thing too is,

704
00:43:52,214 --> 00:43:56,717
in the last couple of years,

705
00:43:56,737 --> 00:43:59,579
I think it's been really important to think about

706
00:43:59,779 --> 00:44:05,283
what kinds of communication is the best suited for

707
00:44:06,364 --> 00:44:10,167
the other folks that you're trying to build a relationship with because not everyone like

708
00:44:10,327 --> 00:44:14,892
some folks take two video calls swimmingly. They're fine being on calls all day long,

709
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:21,338
not a problem. And others it's torture to be on a call for even just like 30 minutes to an hour,

710
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,641
right? Some folks are really strong when it comes to real-time

711
00:44:25,842 --> 00:44:30,384
written communication and others really need things to be written in longer form

712
00:44:30,924 --> 00:44:34,486
with more time to digest, more time to think about their response.

713
00:44:34,906 --> 00:44:40,168
And so I think I think it's really sharpened the need for folks

714
00:44:40,408 --> 00:44:45,591
to invest in their communication skills, as well as their communication empathy.

715
00:44:45,611 --> 00:44:50,853
Wow. It's a lot of food for thought there.

716
00:44:51,294 --> 00:44:54,735
You know, by video, we're all experiencing this content right now.

717
00:44:55,795 --> 00:44:59,956
Brian, I mean, video streaming became part of your professional life.

718
00:45:01,337 --> 00:45:02,117
Talk about that.

719
00:45:02,197 --> 00:45:06,018
Talk about taking a brief journey into this world

720
00:45:06,218 --> 00:45:09,240
where we're actually all natively residing right now.

721
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,860
Yeah, it's funny.

722
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:16,180
we were talking earlier about like character sheets and sort of like where you want to end up.

723
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:19,720
And I mentioned, I had always just dreamed of being an entrepreneur.

724
00:45:20,881 --> 00:45:24,381
But again, Albany, New York, right? It's not Silicon Valley. It's not Seattle.

725
00:45:25,021 --> 00:45:28,482
It's not LA. You guys grew up with this and understanding things like...

726
00:45:29,502 --> 00:45:35,743
You're seeing this all the time. For us, it was like starting a business was the tire shop right

727
00:45:35,783 --> 00:45:40,884
up the road or somebody going out and being an accountant. So I knew I wanted to understand this.

728
00:45:41,224 --> 00:45:41,364
And...

729
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:49,075
And I had been growing my network a little bit. And like Chang said, I also hate the

730
00:45:49,095 --> 00:45:53,718
word networking. I met a buddy at a Game Jam hackathon and we just hit it off.

731
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,302
And it turned out he was doing some kind of investing and he was just complaining that

732
00:45:59,663 --> 00:46:03,786
nobody understands game investing and all this kind of stuff. And so we started talking about it.

733
00:46:03,806 --> 00:46:07,088
And I said, well, if I'm going to be honest, dude, I don't actually understand this investing thing

734
00:46:07,229 --> 00:46:07,409
at all.

735
00:46:08,389 --> 00:46:12,011
none, I don't get it. I don't understand any of the words you're saying. I'm faking it

736
00:46:12,051 --> 00:46:17,733
because I just, you know, I don't want to look like I'm dumb." And, you know, he said,

737
00:46:17,793 --> 00:46:22,574
oh, well, you know, let me teach you. So, probably one of my best friends still to this

738
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:28,356
day. But anyway, so yeah, I had this opportunity probably 2015 when kind of like the streaming

739
00:46:28,396 --> 00:46:34,158
services were coming out 2014, you know, the Netflix and the prime video that, um,

740
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:40,602
We had put this tool set together for games, and we had sold this like back end stuff to games,

741
00:46:40,622 --> 00:46:44,644
where you'd sort of like spin your game up on our software. And we said, well, shoot, like,

742
00:46:45,104 --> 00:46:48,146
you could kind of like spin a whole video platform up on this software. Let's go see

743
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:53,509
if we can raise some money for this. So I think of this as like my side quests, you know,

744
00:46:53,969 --> 00:46:55,770
do I like video streaming? I mean,

745
00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:02,754
Not that much. I like video games. But I wanted to get this on my character sheet. I knew I wanted

746
00:47:02,774 --> 00:47:09,318
to get this. And so we spent a year pitching venture capital companies and being told no

747
00:47:09,338 --> 00:47:13,601
a thousand times. And again, you got to understand, I didn't understand any of this.

748
00:47:14,381 --> 00:47:19,164
I remember pitching one of the really big VCs now, like Andreessen Orowitz and them just being

749
00:47:20,574 --> 00:47:21,154
Who is this guy?

750
00:47:21,174 --> 00:47:22,955
Like, you know, he doesn't get the slightest what's going on.

751
00:47:24,356 --> 00:47:27,599
You know, and it's sort of like funny to look back at, but this is how careers are.

752
00:47:27,639 --> 00:47:30,061
You know, everybody looks back at how naive they were.

753
00:47:30,081 --> 00:47:31,282
Nobody's bored knowing anything.

754
00:47:31,302 --> 00:47:34,144
You have to just learn it and be humble and ask, just like Connie said.

755
00:47:34,224 --> 00:47:37,826
So so I always think of this as my side quest because I did spend

756
00:47:37,846 --> 00:47:38,867
a couple of years doing this.

757
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:45,492
The company was not successful, but, you know, in this weird path of life

758
00:47:45,552 --> 00:47:47,514
and like getting lost in the woods and coming back.

759
00:47:48,214 --> 00:47:52,196
You know, that friend that I made, we're still, you know, best friends, basically to these days.

760
00:47:53,697 --> 00:47:54,538
He took some of that.

761
00:47:55,078 --> 00:47:57,199
He was able to get kind of a company off the ground.

762
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:00,201
Was it one of these like, you know, venture backed startups? No.

763
00:48:01,022 --> 00:48:04,384
But he had a company and he's been successful and he's still open

764
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:07,005
and he's doing a great job and his company's grown to 40 people.

765
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:09,987
And he took all that work we did seven years ago into that.

766
00:48:10,627 --> 00:48:13,710
And for myself, I had a chance to meet all these VCs.

767
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:17,174
And honestly, back then, there really was nobody investing in gaming.

768
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:21,177
But along the way, a couple of them said, oh, this guy doesn't know anything

769
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:24,300
about VC, but knows a lot about games.

770
00:48:24,461 --> 00:48:28,525
And so I got asked to be a venture partner with Convoy Ventures,

771
00:48:28,545 --> 00:48:29,385
which I work at now.

772
00:48:29,425 --> 00:48:31,447
And that's how I met all these folks is by.

773
00:48:32,218 --> 00:48:34,199
you know, probably embarrassing myself a couple of times.

774
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:37,721
So I always think of this as my side quest, but it's like any side quest,

775
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:40,122
you know, you sort of complete it and you go back to the main quest.

776
00:48:40,903 --> 00:48:43,284
And that's kind of like where, you know, I kind of ended up.

777
00:48:43,344 --> 00:48:45,986
But, you know, out of that, you know, my character sheet at this point

778
00:48:46,726 --> 00:48:48,387
has a lot of experience on this.

779
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:52,049
And, you know, I've vetted 100 companies and I know how these deals work now.

780
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:55,271
And, you know, I've had a chance to see this more than a lot of people have.

781
00:48:55,311 --> 00:48:57,532
And and but that's how I picked it up.

782
00:48:59,594 --> 00:49:00,074
That's so cool.

783
00:49:00,114 --> 00:49:01,275
I mean, something that that.

784
00:49:02,261 --> 00:49:08,843
all of you share now is that you have the vantage point of career, not just job or role.

785
00:49:09,884 --> 00:49:14,766
And now you have some more perspective on how important it was to take the shots when you took them,

786
00:49:15,326 --> 00:49:19,627
but also of how many shots you may have to take.

787
00:49:20,408 --> 00:49:28,771
Right. And and perhaps for everyone at home who may be like, OK, I came to this talk.

788
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:29,932
Right.

789
00:49:30,566 --> 00:49:32,988
I don't know if I want to take my next shot now,

790
00:49:33,489 --> 00:49:35,650
or in 10 years, if I want to get promoted,

791
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:38,353
or I want to herd the troops right now.

792
00:49:40,935 --> 00:49:42,356
I'll go to you, Jing, first.

793
00:49:42,376 --> 00:49:43,297
Okay?

794
00:49:43,697 --> 00:49:47,360
I mean, you were on a pretty well-defined career path.

795
00:49:48,101 --> 00:49:50,162
Riot games, okay?

796
00:49:52,665 --> 00:49:53,805
Externalities aside,

797
00:49:55,607 --> 00:49:59,530
why did you decide to risk that stable job

798
00:50:00,416 --> 00:50:03,819
and take your shot, right, with bot school.

799
00:50:05,421 --> 00:50:08,965
Oh, man. I've done that actually a couple times. I did it earlier

800
00:50:08,985 --> 00:50:12,688
this year when I when I decided to say goodbye for now from

801
00:50:12,869 --> 00:50:16,412
Phoenix Labs and spend time on my personal projects. But yeah,

802
00:50:16,432 --> 00:50:19,755
like the the experience with with Riot.

803
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:27,279
It was because I had a clear understanding that I wanted to do broader skill acquisition

804
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:35,391
and that there was a pocket of skills that I knew I could only experience if I started my own company.

805
00:50:36,956 --> 00:50:46,043
I could read all I wanted about, you know, fundraising with VCs and setting up a business.

806
00:50:46,063 --> 00:50:51,227
And I got to do a little bit of a proxy of the starting a business component with the Riot

807
00:50:51,288 --> 00:50:56,011
merch team because it was like a, it was a separate business unit within Riot Games and

808
00:50:56,111 --> 00:50:59,674
learned a lot of that, but that, that was, you know, I equated that experience so that.

809
00:51:00,615 --> 00:51:03,797
skydiving with a tandem instructor strapped to your back.

810
00:51:04,577 --> 00:51:08,918
And I just wanted to jump out of the plane one time at least by myself.

811
00:51:09,098 --> 00:51:14,400
So I would know what it would feel like to, you know, handle that adrenaline

812
00:51:14,861 --> 00:51:16,541
to have to pull the cords.

813
00:51:16,561 --> 00:51:18,642
I don't know. I only know this much about skydiving.

814
00:51:18,702 --> 00:51:22,023
I've only ever been actually tandem skydiving one time.

815
00:51:22,263 --> 00:51:24,804
So this this analogy is going to fade away really quickly.

816
00:51:24,824 --> 00:51:27,545
But essentially, I knew I wanted to do it at least once.

817
00:51:27,905 --> 00:51:31,567
so that I would be able to learn all of those things and really experience them.

818
00:51:31,807 --> 00:51:37,770
Because knowing that, you know, I would look at what I would regret

819
00:51:38,831 --> 00:51:41,432
if I didn't do it versus what I would regret if I did do it.

820
00:51:41,912 --> 00:51:42,112
And if

821
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:52,341
I did do it. The thing I might regret is a loss of financial security for a chunk of time.

822
00:51:53,101 --> 00:52:00,487
My pride in not being able to build a company. But the amount that both those things were things that

823
00:52:00,507 --> 00:52:07,171
I could overcome. And I knew that I would learn so much that you just can't get out of a textbook

824
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:11,254
that you can't get by going to school by just going through and experiencing it.

825
00:52:11,935 --> 00:52:12,715
Um, and

826
00:52:13,452 --> 00:52:15,453
Whereas if I flipped it around and I thought about,

827
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:17,015
well, what I regret if I stayed?

828
00:52:17,055 --> 00:52:19,296
It's like, I just, I would give up a chance

829
00:52:19,657 --> 00:52:22,839
to really learn and flesh out this entire portion

830
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,502
of this entire branch of my skill tree

831
00:52:27,503 --> 00:52:32,387
that I can't, I wouldn't be able to earn in some other way

832
00:52:32,407 --> 00:52:33,428
by staying at the company.

833
00:52:33,828 --> 00:52:35,729
And I also, you know, like Anne was saying earlier,

834
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:38,471
there is, there are some things that are easier

835
00:52:38,552 --> 00:52:39,612
to be able to do at certain.

836
00:52:40,253 --> 00:52:44,856
points in your life. And it's in my life circumstance at that

837
00:52:44,876 --> 00:52:48,558
time was I did not have to think about a mortgage and I did not

838
00:52:48,578 --> 00:52:52,141
have to think about kids. And so I could have I had a higher

839
00:52:52,301 --> 00:52:57,284
appetite for taking on some of the financial risks. And I also

840
00:52:57,304 --> 00:53:01,067
just said to myself, I thought of it as like, as if I were

841
00:53:01,247 --> 00:53:03,348
doing a self study MBA.

842
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:07,251
Like that was the equivalent, right? I'm going to go learn some of this stuff.

843
00:53:08,572 --> 00:53:15,358
And when I have looked at any of these kinds of decisions, one of the frameworks I typically use

844
00:53:15,398 --> 00:53:22,124
is like, I really list out all the different things that I care about from a value standpoint

845
00:53:22,344 --> 00:53:23,485
and the things that I'm feeling.

846
00:53:23,945 --> 00:53:28,311
you know, fearful about or excited about as I'm looking at the opportunity. And then I try to

847
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:36,242
prioritize between what are these things in terms of priority and importance to me? And if I stay

848
00:53:36,282 --> 00:53:39,046
versus if I go, how would I actually, you know,

849
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:45,188
rate how true or how present or, you know,

850
00:53:45,228 --> 00:53:47,769
what would I score each of these different options?

851
00:53:48,129 --> 00:53:50,930
And then that doesn't necessarily give me a final answer,

852
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:53,051
but it prompts a lot of good introspection

853
00:53:53,151 --> 00:53:54,271
and internal conversation.

854
00:53:54,632 --> 00:53:58,413
And I came up the other end of that exercise, like, you know,

855
00:53:58,693 --> 00:53:59,633
and just thought, you know,

856
00:53:59,794 --> 00:54:03,035
I have so much more to lose if I don't try this right now

857
00:54:03,135 --> 00:54:03,895
than if I do.

858
00:54:03,915 --> 00:54:06,236
Yeah, that's how I got there.

859
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:11,228
What I love about what all of you talk about,

860
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:13,409
that all of you are acting on the world.

861
00:54:13,509 --> 00:54:16,590
You're all having a plan, you're assessing,

862
00:54:17,231 --> 00:54:21,012
developing skills, taking side quests,

863
00:54:21,433 --> 00:54:23,534
but all of you talking about your agency.

864
00:54:23,554 --> 00:54:32,358
So I wanna ask you now, like, I'll go to you first, Anne.

865
00:54:33,978 --> 00:54:35,619
Are you where you wanna be?

866
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:46,477
right now and if yes or if no, like what is the planning you're doing now? What are the

867
00:54:46,537 --> 00:54:49,301
skills you're developing now for your next phase?

868
00:54:52,617 --> 00:54:58,019
Currently, I'm not even looking at the next phase because I'm really happy where I'm at.

869
00:54:58,259 --> 00:55:01,401
It's it's really I I I'm really happy.

870
00:55:01,621 --> 00:55:08,183
It's every day I wake up and I'm happy to work with the team I'm working with within the company I'm working in.

871
00:55:08,623 --> 00:55:10,564
And it's it's I'm just grateful.

872
00:55:10,664 --> 00:55:12,605
So right now, it's just I want to do the best.

873
00:55:12,705 --> 00:55:17,427
And one thing that Connie, I think you're the first one that mentioned it, that how much.

874
00:55:18,367 --> 00:55:23,991
We have to show us as vulnerable because this is what we are, everybody as humans.

875
00:55:24,951 --> 00:55:28,974
And I'm sure it's the same for for you guys also.

876
00:55:29,014 --> 00:55:32,616
But at every changes, it's it's really scary.

877
00:55:33,076 --> 00:55:34,517
It's a leap of faith.

878
00:55:34,637 --> 00:55:38,539
And it's it's only you when sometimes the faith you have in yourself

879
00:55:38,619 --> 00:55:43,542
is not at the highest point, you know, so it's it's really uncomfortable.

880
00:55:43,562 --> 00:55:43,622
But.

881
00:55:46,202 --> 00:55:51,624
I would just suggest to everybody, just do it because all the things that you learn

882
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:57,526
and the things that you have as a baggage, as a background, is not going to go away.

883
00:55:58,127 --> 00:56:02,708
Like when I moved to my first associate producer in narrative for Far Cry 3,

884
00:56:03,189 --> 00:56:08,591
I was an animation trade director at UB Stuff in the HR department,

885
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:12,933
which was far away from the associate producer for narratives.

886
00:56:13,789 --> 00:56:22,436
But then I did a study about the the state of animation and cinematics and scripted event at Ubisoft Montreal.

887
00:56:23,057 --> 00:56:29,802
And I became after the presentation kind of a specialist about narrative at Ubisoft.

888
00:56:29,822 --> 00:56:31,464
And I was like, no, I'm not.

889
00:56:31,564 --> 00:56:34,206
It's like, yeah, I know.

890
00:56:34,346 --> 00:56:37,789
I was not in production doing narratives or cinematics and whatnot.

891
00:56:37,809 --> 00:56:41,652
It's like, yeah, but you have that perspective now that nobody has.

892
00:56:42,193 --> 00:56:46,637
So there you go and do the job and help us ship Far Cry 3.

893
00:56:47,017 --> 00:56:49,159
And it's like, OK.

894
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:53,644
And it was scary, but I've learned so much in that process.

895
00:56:53,764 --> 00:56:57,627
And we all learn so much in that process doing this thing.

896
00:56:57,647 --> 00:57:03,052
So it's always it's really different than somebody that is becoming an expert.

897
00:57:03,873 --> 00:57:11,275
So the knowledge is just accumulating in one or multiple areas, but it's really bland and it's really bold.

898
00:57:11,815 --> 00:57:16,176
When you change course, it's like, oh, I'm I'm kind of losing something.

899
00:57:16,336 --> 00:57:17,556
No, you're gaining.

900
00:57:17,616 --> 00:57:20,497
It's just not in the same area, just widening.

901
00:57:20,577 --> 00:57:25,138
And we have to to see this to to be able to to make that step, actually,

902
00:57:25,198 --> 00:57:26,978
because like I said, it's a scary thing.

903
00:57:27,018 --> 00:57:29,979
It's like starting a new job very often.

904
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:31,439
It's a new adventure.

905
00:57:31,499 --> 00:57:33,400
So it's a lot of things that you don't know.

906
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,403
And you have to ask all the time to everybody.

907
00:57:37,563 --> 00:57:40,065
I don't know. I'm new to that. Can you help me?

908
00:57:40,465 --> 00:57:42,486
Yes. All right. Everybody is there to help.

909
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:47,370
Well, speaking of right, the people in this crowd

910
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:48,591
who are watching this talk,

911
00:57:50,473 --> 00:57:51,413
they're finding their own paths

912
00:57:51,433 --> 00:57:52,714
and they're going to want to hopefully

913
00:57:52,734 --> 00:57:55,596
continue to connect with us, right, because all of us agree,

914
00:57:55,616 --> 00:57:58,479
you know, that we're here to help and to lift each other up

915
00:57:58,519 --> 00:57:59,620
and lift up our craft.

916
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:02,822
And I actually want to start with you, Anne, because we're right.

917
00:58:02,842 --> 00:58:03,022
Because.

918
00:58:03,641 --> 00:58:07,422
Now we know where you are and people want to vibe like you're vibing.

919
00:58:07,742 --> 00:58:09,522
How do people stay in touch with you?

920
00:58:11,662 --> 00:58:14,243
And you both my Twitter keys

921
00:58:14,523 --> 00:58:17,503
and you both you can join me on

922
00:58:18,184 --> 00:58:21,164
a mile on the Discord channel.

923
00:58:22,004 --> 00:58:26,185
Aside from the job, I have my personal server,

924
00:58:26,245 --> 00:58:31,846
but I think that Twitter would be the best way to to to link with me.

925
00:58:33,390 --> 00:58:33,790
Perfect.

926
00:58:34,590 --> 00:58:36,731
Connie, I'll ask you the same thing.

927
00:58:37,891 --> 00:58:40,872
Same thing for all the mad smack talk

928
00:58:40,892 --> 00:58:43,273
we've said about Twitter, right?

929
00:58:44,413 --> 00:58:45,254
I love it, right?

930
00:58:45,334 --> 00:58:46,894
Like I don't use it that much.

931
00:58:46,954 --> 00:58:48,955
Well, okay, I'm casually active.

932
00:58:49,015 --> 00:58:52,276
So absolutely, I believe that our Twitter handles

933
00:58:52,336 --> 00:58:53,916
are in our bios, our speaker bios.

934
00:58:53,956 --> 00:58:55,557
So please feel free to reach out.

935
00:58:56,297 --> 00:58:57,858
I'm always happy to answer questions

936
00:58:57,998 --> 00:59:00,158
and chat with folks and share my dog pics.

937
00:59:01,399 --> 00:59:01,959
Amazing.

938
00:59:03,133 --> 00:59:04,775
Brian, same question.

939
00:59:05,015 --> 00:59:06,137
Yeah, I said, I don't like Twitter,

940
00:59:06,157 --> 00:59:07,258
but probably the same thing.

941
00:59:07,939 --> 00:59:09,941
Also, like I'm on LinkedIn a lot,

942
00:59:10,001 --> 00:59:12,164
even though I think nobody sort of loves LinkedIn,

943
00:59:12,224 --> 00:59:13,405
but you sort of have to be there.

944
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:14,166
You definitely have to be there.

945
00:59:14,186 --> 00:59:14,687
So I'm there too.

946
00:59:16,984 --> 00:59:18,405
I'm working on building.

947
00:59:18,726 --> 00:59:21,548
I bought a firehouse and I'm working on building a training center here

948
00:59:21,608 --> 00:59:23,489
for people who want to get into games so that future

949
00:59:23,529 --> 00:59:26,272
Bryans of the world don't have the same trouble networking as anyone else.

950
00:59:26,332 --> 00:59:29,274
So if you want to move to the great Mecca of upstate New York,

951
00:59:29,434 --> 00:59:32,196
come hang out with me and the training center when it's done in like six

952
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:32,697
or eight months.

953
00:59:32,797 --> 00:59:36,780
And you, too, can be sitting in negative 15 degree weather

954
00:59:38,361 --> 00:59:39,522
on an afternoon on a Tuesday.

955
00:59:39,763 --> 00:59:43,446
So, yeah, we actually also have a gaming firehouse in L.A., but I digress.

956
00:59:43,886 --> 00:59:44,166
Nice.

957
00:59:45,228 --> 00:59:46,169
who brought us together.

958
00:59:46,429 --> 00:59:47,769
How can people keep this going?

959
00:59:47,849 --> 00:59:50,250
They're like, I wanna be on this chain.

960
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:50,870
How do they connect?

961
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,450
Yeah, hit me up on Twitter.

962
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:54,511
I'm also on LinkedIn as well.

963
00:59:54,711 --> 00:59:58,232
I'm on Twitter infrequently,

964
00:59:58,392 --> 01:00:01,193
but I'm always open to chatting with folks

965
01:00:01,213 --> 01:00:03,373
who are interested in learning more about the industry

966
01:00:03,413 --> 01:00:04,674
or navigating their careers in it.

967
01:00:05,634 --> 01:00:06,474
I'm on Twitter too.

968
01:00:07,194 --> 01:00:09,535
Thank you for joining us for our panel.

969
01:00:10,975 --> 01:00:11,175
Yeah.

970
01:00:16,971 --> 01:00:17,152
You
