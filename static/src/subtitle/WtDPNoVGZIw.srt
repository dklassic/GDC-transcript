1
00:00:05,709 --> 00:00:07,930
All right, hey everybody, my name is Seth Koster

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,931
and I am the game programmer and co-founder

3
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:11,812
of the studio Butterscotch Shenanigans.

4
00:00:12,272 --> 00:00:13,313
Little bit about our studio.

5
00:00:13,653 --> 00:00:15,033
We were founded in November of 2012.

6
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,235
We started as a two-person team

7
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:20,136
and we've since expanded to a four-person team,

8
00:00:20,176 --> 00:00:21,957
so we've just grown massively.

9
00:00:22,778 --> 00:00:25,359
We've launched five titles since our inception

10
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:27,740
and the most notable title we've launched is Crashlands,

11
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,701
which is an action crafting RPG.

12
00:00:30,582 --> 00:00:31,562
We launched it in January of 2016,

13
00:00:32,703 --> 00:00:34,405
and in that year it received numerous

14
00:00:34,465 --> 00:00:35,526
Mobile Game of the Year awards,

15
00:00:35,926 --> 00:00:36,987
sold over half a million units,

16
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:39,249
and received a 93 Metacritic score for mobile.

17
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:41,490
So by all accounts, it's okay,

18
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:42,832
and people seem to like it.

19
00:00:43,892 --> 00:00:45,454
And before I go into the meat of this talk,

20
00:00:45,834 --> 00:00:48,176
I need to remind you guys that we only have 20 minutes,

21
00:00:48,376 --> 00:00:49,717
which means what I'm about to say

22
00:00:50,237 --> 00:00:52,860
has absolutely no nuance whatsoever.

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,602
So if you have a bunch of questions at the end of this,

24
00:00:55,742 --> 00:00:56,743
that makes a lot of sense,

25
00:00:57,163 --> 00:00:58,724
and you're gonna have to just think about it, I guess.

26
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:03,462
All right, so because Crashlands did pretty well for us,

27
00:01:03,502 --> 00:01:04,484
we get this question a lot,

28
00:01:04,904 --> 00:01:06,967
which is how do we go about designing our games?

29
00:01:07,408 --> 00:01:08,409
And to answer that question,

30
00:01:08,449 --> 00:01:09,951
I'm gonna ask a few questions of my own.

31
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:12,215
Why do studios crunch?

32
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,438
Why do studios go bankrupt?

33
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:16,200
And why do projects get canceled?

34
00:01:17,434 --> 00:01:22,318
Well, these are the kinds of things that you would expect to see in a studio that has plans.

35
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:28,824
And so, we've managed to sidestep a lot of these problems or mitigate them entirely by

36
00:01:29,424 --> 00:01:32,026
never having a plan of any kind whatsoever.

37
00:01:32,747 --> 00:01:36,270
For example, we don't have deadlines, so we have no reason to crunch.

38
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,432
And deadlines are the kinds of things you have when you have plans.

39
00:01:40,377 --> 00:01:42,298
And this kind of anti-planning philosophy

40
00:01:42,779 --> 00:01:45,802
goes all the way down into our game development style.

41
00:01:46,382 --> 00:01:49,305
Because to answer the question, how do we design our games?

42
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:50,226
Well, we don't.

43
00:01:50,947 --> 00:01:51,807
We just iterate.

44
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:53,929
We've never done a game design document.

45
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:56,131
We don't really do anything like what

46
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:57,292
you would call concept art.

47
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:00,035
And if you were to pick any one thing out

48
00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:02,077
of any one of our games, we didn't

49
00:02:02,157 --> 00:02:03,759
know that that was going to be in there

50
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:05,720
until the moment we put it in.

51
00:02:06,613 --> 00:02:09,179
So for those of you who are more accustomed to a much more

52
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,444
structured game development style, you're probably

53
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,448
thinking, OK, how does that work?

54
00:02:13,488 --> 00:02:15,212
That sounds like absolute chaos.

55
00:02:15,232 --> 00:02:17,116
So that's what we're going to talk about.

56
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,903
The first thing to know about iterative game development

57
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:22,645
is that it's not random.

58
00:02:23,306 --> 00:02:24,527
The iteration is directional.

59
00:02:24,768 --> 00:02:26,930
And the thing that you're always iterating towards

60
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:30,134
is the vision of the game, which is just the core idea.

61
00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:33,338
We know a lot of developers that get really fixated

62
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:35,500
on trying to find the perfect game idea.

63
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,362
And they bounce from project to project,

64
00:02:37,382 --> 00:02:39,204
just trying to find that one gem.

65
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:46,416
At our studio we believe that there is no such thing as a good game idea or a bad game idea.

66
00:02:46,516 --> 00:02:49,438
There's just good or bad execution of a game idea.

67
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:53,962
And we believe this because we've seen ideas that were just so far out there,

68
00:02:54,162 --> 00:03:00,507
like Be a Goat and Break Things, that have turned into huge classics that everybody loves.

69
00:03:01,288 --> 00:03:04,431
that we've just come to believe that you can just do whatever you want,

70
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:07,414
and as long as you understand the fundamentals of what makes your game good,

71
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:11,297
and follow that path, then it just doesn't really matter.

72
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,600
So this is the core idea that we have as a studio,

73
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:17,323
is just what your game idea is, is completely irrelevant.

74
00:03:18,086 --> 00:03:21,588
So if that's the case, why do you really need a game idea?

75
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:24,750
It's because your studio is a boat,

76
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,831
and it has limited resources on it.

77
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:30,413
And at some point, you gotta get to land and restock, right?

78
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:32,094
In other words, you gotta launch a game.

79
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,776
And if you hand everybody on your team a paddle,

80
00:03:35,036 --> 00:03:36,637
and they all start rowing in different directions,

81
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:38,398
you're just gonna spin in place,

82
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,559
and everybody's gonna get scurvy.

83
00:03:41,877 --> 00:03:46,404
So the point of a vision is just to get everybody paddling all in the same direction.

84
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:47,786
And that's really all that it's for.

85
00:03:48,948 --> 00:03:52,594
So in our studio the way that we go about sort of structuring our vision development

86
00:03:52,654 --> 00:03:55,819
process if you could call it that is we keep it very simple.

87
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:59,976
First, we keep it brief, so single phrase or sentence.

88
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,837
Once you get into paragraph territory,

89
00:04:02,857 --> 00:04:05,098
that starts to look like a game design document,

90
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:08,520
which is a plan, and once you have one of those, you die.

91
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,061
So don't do that.

92
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:11,962
We also keep it very high level.

93
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,183
So we don't really go into a lot of specifics

94
00:04:14,743 --> 00:04:16,885
about the story, the characters, any of that stuff.

95
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:19,246
We just focus on what we would say

96
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,327
are mechanics, experiences, or feelings.

97
00:04:22,103 --> 00:04:26,686
And the reason we focus on these is because these are simple touchstones that we can always

98
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:29,888
refer back to and ask, is the game feeling like this?

99
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,689
Or do we have this mechanic and are we executing it really well?

100
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:36,279
So to give you an example of how we did this with Crashlands,

101
00:04:36,999 --> 00:04:40,660
the Crashlands vision is a light-hearted, open-world

102
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,300
crafting adventure with tameable creatures and lots of jokes.

103
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,241
We ended with a lot more than that.

104
00:04:46,361 --> 00:04:48,201
And we also, at this time, we didn't know who the character

105
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:51,042
was, what their motivations were, what the story was, where

106
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,542
the game was, any of that stuff.

107
00:04:53,262 --> 00:04:54,922
These were just the targets that we were trying to hit.

108
00:04:55,843 --> 00:04:56,663
And then we got started.

109
00:04:57,183 --> 00:04:59,243
So once you have your vision, it's

110
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,203
time to start prototyping.

111
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,527
The prototype only exists as a sort of anchor point for your iteration process,

112
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:08,030
and that's really all it is.

113
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:10,394
This is the thing that will become your game in the end.

114
00:05:11,672 --> 00:05:14,314
So to start your prototype off on the right foot,

115
00:05:14,755 --> 00:05:16,916
you're going to want to find the foundational piece.

116
00:05:17,397 --> 00:05:19,418
So if your vision has something that you believe

117
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,620
to be sort of the core element, that if you nail that,

118
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,362
then everything else will kind of spin off of that.

119
00:05:25,023 --> 00:05:26,684
Then that's where you want to focus your efforts

120
00:05:26,964 --> 00:05:28,345
for that early prototyping phase.

121
00:05:29,046 --> 00:05:31,007
Crashlands was a crafting game,

122
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,149
and so we thought if we get the crafting, then we're good.

123
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:34,550
So.

124
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,311
you can't craft unless you're collecting stuff.

125
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:40,552
And so the first thing we had to do was focus around that,

126
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,193
acquiring things in the world

127
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:43,413
and then building stuff out of them.

128
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:46,074
So with that in mind, we started prototyping.

129
00:05:46,474 --> 00:05:48,135
And on day one, we had this,

130
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:54,757
which is a gray circle that picks up hand placed leaves.

131
00:05:55,277 --> 00:05:57,118
There's only 10 leaves, the camera doesn't move.

132
00:05:57,738 --> 00:05:59,318
And once you pick up all 10 leaves,

133
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:03,960
they craft into a pair of leaf shoes, I guess.

134
00:06:04,915 --> 00:06:07,799
So that is our crashlands prototype on day one,

135
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,902
and now we can start going through the iteration process.

136
00:06:11,382 --> 00:06:13,465
So what we do in-house for our iteration process

137
00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:15,947
is first we play the game,

138
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:19,131
and we try to play the game in a very sort of,

139
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:20,452
you gotta set your ego aside,

140
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,695
and you wanna think about what would a player perceive

141
00:06:22,955 --> 00:06:24,737
of this if I just handed this to a random person.

142
00:06:25,493 --> 00:06:27,495
So you think about it as if somebody else made the game.

143
00:06:28,235 --> 00:06:29,737
And then you want to evaluate,

144
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:32,579
how is this current state of the game

145
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:34,880
lining up to the vision that we originally put forth?

146
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,302
And where are we just really missing the mark?

147
00:06:37,622 --> 00:06:39,383
And what kinds of systems do we need to shore up?

148
00:06:40,744 --> 00:06:43,306
You can go ahead and invent solutions for those problems,

149
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:45,668
bring those back to the team, come to a consensus

150
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,209
if it's something huge, like if you say,

151
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:48,810
we need to rip out a system entirely.

152
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:50,852
So you go ahead and do that.

153
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:52,673
You implement those things,

154
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:54,594
and then the loop starts over again.

155
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:01,885
And so the important thing to know about this iteration concept is that a lot of teams start

156
00:07:01,905 --> 00:07:03,386
to forecast at this point.

157
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:06,989
Once they start working on a system they say, well once we get the combat in we're going

158
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:11,011
to need to buff debuff system and once we have that we're going to need combos or whatever.

159
00:07:11,912 --> 00:07:15,795
And you start forecasting what the game is going to feel like 3, 5, 10, 20 iteration

160
00:07:15,855 --> 00:07:16,735
cycles down the road.

161
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:18,016
Well guess what that is?

162
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:19,217
It's planning.

163
00:07:19,638 --> 00:07:20,218
So don't do that.

164
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:24,439
You should iterate based on what the game is,

165
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:25,740
not what it will be,

166
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,182
because all that time you spent forecasting,

167
00:07:28,302 --> 00:07:29,162
you're just gonna be wrong,

168
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:31,064
because you can't know what the game's gonna be like.

169
00:07:33,085 --> 00:07:34,146
So with that in mind,

170
00:07:34,506 --> 00:07:38,589
let's take a look at what Crashlands evolved into over time

171
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,412
from this weird gray circle picking up leaves

172
00:07:42,092 --> 00:07:42,853
into what it is today.

173
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:44,894
So here we were on day one.

174
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:48,030
After a couple weeks, literally everything's different.

175
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,110
All the art has changed.

176
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,190
And this is all placeholder art as well,

177
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:53,191
because the art we're just using to sort of

178
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:55,812
try different color palettes and shapes and stuff

179
00:07:55,832 --> 00:07:57,672
to kind of see what's feeling good.

180
00:07:57,712 --> 00:07:59,353
Is this kind of hitting the target

181
00:07:59,373 --> 00:08:00,673
that we set forth in the vision

182
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:03,014
with the full intention of doing a repass

183
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:04,114
on these assets later.

184
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:10,653
At this point, we also gave the character the ability to remove its arms and replace them with anything in the environment.

185
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:15,315
It was an insane and terrible idea, so that didn't last more than this week.

186
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:20,397
But this is the early phase of the game where all bets are off.

187
00:08:20,697 --> 00:08:25,058
Anything's on the table. We can do whatever we want and just see how does this line up with the vision.

188
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:30,799
After a couple months, the game starts to solidify and look a lot more like the modern

189
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:31,820
version of the game today.

190
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,804
And we have one biome in place and it's not fully fleshed out.

191
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:40,968
We're learning about how to make a scalable and robust crafting system.

192
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:42,829
We have lots and lots of stuff in the world.

193
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,972
We're starting to figure out who the character is, but we don't care that much yet.

194
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:50,276
You can craft yourself armor and weapons and there's combat and all that stuff.

195
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:54,851
So the first thing we had to do was get that crafting system in and once we had that, then

196
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:56,615
we could start kind of layering the rest on top.

197
00:08:57,657 --> 00:08:59,823
And then finally, as we approached launch.

198
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:01,895
This is what the game turned into.

199
00:09:01,935 --> 00:09:03,996
We ended up with about a 60,000 word story.

200
00:09:04,977 --> 00:09:06,878
And yes, you can put story into your game

201
00:09:06,898 --> 00:09:08,639
through this weird chaotic process,

202
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:10,460
and we'll talk about that in a little bit.

203
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,442
We have nearly 1,000 unique items in the game,

204
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:16,723
500 craftable recipes, just tons and tons of content,

205
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:20,686
none of which we knew was gonna be there until it was.

206
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,048
So we like to think about this process

207
00:09:24,468 --> 00:09:26,169
as the game discovering itself over time.

208
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:30,250
Because as iterators, rather than designers,

209
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,430
it's our job to simply play the game,

210
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:36,491
listen to it, feel it, and kind of feel out

211
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:38,352
what it seems to want to become,

212
00:09:39,032 --> 00:09:41,253
and just follow the trails of what's fun.

213
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:43,533
If something's boring, we try to fix it,

214
00:09:43,653 --> 00:09:45,294
or if we can't fix it, we get rid of it,

215
00:09:45,374 --> 00:09:46,614
like removing your arms

216
00:09:46,694 --> 00:09:48,435
and replacing them with weird things.

217
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:53,996
And over time, you can see that the game solidifies very quickly,

218
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:57,577
because the first three screenshots are the closest together in time,

219
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,798
but the last two screenshots look the most similar.

220
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:04,900
Because those early days, the game is kind of like a white hot ball of magma.

221
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:08,481
It's just very liquid and fluid, but the longer it sits,

222
00:10:08,781 --> 00:10:10,381
the more it solidifies, the more it cools,

223
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:12,862
and the more it just sticks to whatever shape you give it.

224
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:18,906
So that is the iterative process that we use to make our games with no planning at all.

225
00:10:20,146 --> 00:10:22,408
But there are some things that if you want to do this in your studio,

226
00:10:22,968 --> 00:10:25,930
that if you take these philosophies into your workflow,

227
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,593
then it'll help you kind of work through these iteration cycles much more quickly.

228
00:10:31,677 --> 00:10:34,779
So the first thing that we do is we focus really hard on speed,

229
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,662
because iteration is a compounding process.

230
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:41,085
If you can get 20 iteration cycles in at the same time

231
00:10:41,105 --> 00:10:42,366
that somebody else can get three,

232
00:10:42,947 --> 00:10:44,148
you're just going to have a better game.

233
00:10:44,288 --> 00:10:45,209
In that same amount of time, it's

234
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,730
going to be much more cohesive, and you're

235
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,091
going to understand it much better.

236
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:51,955
Because of that, our studio has a philosophy called

237
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:52,996
take the time to go fast.

238
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:56,497
which is just a little saying where, you know,

239
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:59,679
if you think there's a tool or something you can learn

240
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:00,660
or something that you need,

241
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,482
that if that's gonna save 20 minutes a day for you

242
00:11:03,842 --> 00:11:06,384
on something, but it takes you eight hours to figure it out,

243
00:11:06,904 --> 00:11:09,126
still worth it because that's a permanent gain

244
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:09,966
in your speed, right?

245
00:11:10,687 --> 00:11:12,728
And so we always focus on speed.

246
00:11:12,748 --> 00:11:15,970
We do lots and lots of game jams to sort of test ourselves

247
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,751
and we'll make games in just a couple of hours

248
00:11:18,152 --> 00:11:19,493
just to see what we're capable of

249
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,434
and try to find our weaknesses in our processes.

250
00:11:22,713 --> 00:11:24,634
We also love the phrase, can we not?

251
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,516
Which is just a way of asking yourself,

252
00:11:26,696 --> 00:11:28,697
am I doing stuff that's a waste of time?

253
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:32,720
And what would happen if I just didn't do those things?

254
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:36,703
Because what we've found is that speed of development

255
00:11:36,803 --> 00:11:38,545
largely comes from cutting out things

256
00:11:38,945 --> 00:11:40,346
that you just don't need to be doing.

257
00:11:41,387 --> 00:11:42,848
Whereas most people tend to try to focus

258
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:44,729
on just doing the same things faster.

259
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,591
And that's where you start crunching,

260
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:47,431
that's where you get burnout,

261
00:11:47,451 --> 00:11:48,652
that's where you get all these other problems.

262
00:11:49,313 --> 00:11:52,756
So because of this, we actually only have to work four days a week, and it's still fine.

263
00:11:54,478 --> 00:11:59,662
We also adhere pretty strongly to the good enough principle, which can be summarized by the phrase,

264
00:12:00,063 --> 00:12:01,444
perfect is the enemy of good.

265
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:06,569
And to kind of give you an example of how we do this, when we were working on Crashlands early on,

266
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:09,231
we needed to get the first creature into the game.

267
00:12:10,052 --> 00:12:13,536
And we had a set of criteria on what this creature had to do.

268
00:12:14,482 --> 00:12:16,343
For starters, it needed a simple, avoidable attack,

269
00:12:16,644 --> 00:12:17,664
because this is the first creature

270
00:12:17,684 --> 00:12:18,765
that the player's gonna encounter.

271
00:12:19,325 --> 00:12:21,167
And so, they need to be able to understand

272
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:23,228
how to not get killed by this thing.

273
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:25,169
Should be pretty friendly looking,

274
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,450
even though it's dangerous,

275
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:28,312
but we don't wanna scare players away,

276
00:12:28,332 --> 00:12:29,993
because again, it's a lighthearted game.

277
00:12:31,357 --> 00:12:34,699
It needs to fit with the aesthetic of the environment, which is easy for us because

278
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:38,760
we only have one artist, but for other teams this may be a little bit more of a challenge.

279
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:43,602
It needs to have very few moving parts because we don't know how creatures work yet and we

280
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:47,024
don't know how we're going to animate them, and we don't have a plan for that, so we're

281
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:49,244
just going to make something that's easy to implement.

282
00:12:49,825 --> 00:12:54,026
So we handed this list to our artist in the morning, and by noon he had created

283
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:57,188
the Wompit, which is a one-legged creature,

284
00:12:57,268 --> 00:12:59,469
so a few moving parts, no problem there.

285
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:02,650
And it stomps on things, which is a simple attack.

286
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:04,411
You can see it go through the air and land.

287
00:13:05,511 --> 00:13:06,972
So it checks all the boxes.

288
00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:08,933
So we said, is this good enough?

289
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:09,933
Yes, it is.

290
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:13,095
We put it in, and we had it fully implemented

291
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:14,095
by the end of that day.

292
00:13:14,555 --> 00:13:16,016
And that's the same creature that's still

293
00:13:16,036 --> 00:13:18,297
the first creature players encounter in Crashlands.

294
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:25,653
The reason that we stick to this strong good enough principle is that as a developer you

295
00:13:25,673 --> 00:13:28,295
have to understand what do players actually care about.

296
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:33,880
Because when a player encounters this wompet, their reaction is going to be, hell, I'm being

297
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,521
chased by a one-legged hippo.

298
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:41,065
That's sort of where their thought process ends because it's a threat to them, it's coming

299
00:13:41,165 --> 00:13:41,505
after them.

300
00:13:42,806 --> 00:13:44,727
And once it checks all those boxes,

301
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:46,588
they don't care anymore.

302
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:48,689
So a player isn't going to sort of behave

303
00:13:49,109 --> 00:13:50,970
the same way that maybe like a video game producer

304
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,130
looking for perfection might.

305
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,091
The player's not gonna lean in and say,

306
00:13:54,531 --> 00:13:56,132
you know, the ears on that wompet

307
00:13:56,232 --> 00:13:57,993
could be slightly larger, I think.

308
00:13:58,913 --> 00:14:01,574
They don't care because however you present the world,

309
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:04,136
as long as what you've created is good enough and fits,

310
00:14:04,596 --> 00:14:06,357
the player stops asking questions at that point.

311
00:14:06,797 --> 00:14:08,057
So if you're having big debates about

312
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,478
whether your main character should be wearing

313
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,939
jeans or khakis, maybe just don't.

314
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:18,185
Another thing that we like to use is using prototypes to crush debates.

315
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:24,547
This phrase will save you so much time in your development cycle that it's unbelievable.

316
00:14:25,027 --> 00:14:26,528
How long would it take to prototype this idea?

317
00:14:27,288 --> 00:14:31,810
When we were working on Crashlands, we had these floors that players could build and

318
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,090
they could sort of lay them out on the ground.

319
00:14:34,051 --> 00:14:35,372
but players weren't building them

320
00:14:35,712 --> 00:14:37,072
and they weren't using them for anything.

321
00:14:38,273 --> 00:14:41,094
And it turned out that floors were basically a useless item

322
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:43,055
that we hadn't given any purpose.

323
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:46,376
So Sam, our artist, came up with an idea

324
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:48,177
on what we could do to make floors useful.

325
00:14:49,177 --> 00:14:50,758
Adam and I, the other two members of the team,

326
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:53,679
didn't understand how his idea would work

327
00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:55,940
or how it would be feasible or even why it would be good.

328
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,421
And so, of course, we did the natural thing

329
00:14:58,501 --> 00:15:00,281
and we argued about it for three hours.

330
00:15:01,883 --> 00:15:04,245
After three hours we didn't come to a resolution.

331
00:15:04,786 --> 00:15:05,747
We walked away in a huff.

332
00:15:05,967 --> 00:15:09,331
I sat down at my computer and I prototyped it in seven minutes.

333
00:15:10,352 --> 00:15:13,275
Turned out it was a great idea and that's what we have in the game today.

334
00:15:14,256 --> 00:15:19,441
So if you find yourself arguing for a long time, just ask how long would it take to prototype.

335
00:15:20,998 --> 00:15:23,160
So the final piece of this iterative design philosophy

336
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,762
is that a lot of people get really fixated on story.

337
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:29,385
And the question is, can you get stories into your game

338
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:31,687
using this sort of chaotic design method?

339
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:34,849
So to answer that, I'm gonna tell a story of my own.

340
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:39,453
In the beginning of Crashlands development,

341
00:15:39,493 --> 00:15:41,715
we got combat in, in the first couple months.

342
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:45,683
and the player was taking damage but couldn't heal.

343
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:49,144
And so I said to Sam, our artist, I said,

344
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:51,906
we need an item the player can just pick up off the ground

345
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:53,687
and eat it to heal.

346
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:56,068
And so he sent me this flower.

347
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:01,391
And I'm sitting there thinking, who eats flowers?

348
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:02,692
This is weird.

349
00:16:03,652 --> 00:16:06,654
So I just gave it a name and called it bacon weed.

350
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:10,176
And now it heals you and it makes perfect sense.

351
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,832
Later on in the development cycle we we added farming with the player can sort

352
00:16:15,872 --> 00:16:18,873
of plant stuff and put things in pots and regrow stuff

353
00:16:19,434 --> 00:16:24,437
and so a potted bacon weed was born. And as the programmer I was also writing the

354
00:16:24,477 --> 00:16:26,798
tool tips for the items as we implemented them into the game

355
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:29,840
and it was my job to write the tool tip for potted bacon weed.

356
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,842
This was the 30th thing I had written a tool tip for that day. I didn't know what

357
00:16:33,882 --> 00:16:36,644
to say because it's bacon weed in a pot. I mean what

358
00:16:36,684 --> 00:16:40,065
more do you need? So I just made up some nonsense and I

359
00:16:40,105 --> 00:16:40,326
wrote.

360
00:16:41,106 --> 00:16:45,930
Legend says if you leave a potted bacon weed by your back step, the bacon weed fairy will steal your teeth.

361
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:48,752
We said, heh, and then we moved on.

362
00:16:50,053 --> 00:16:53,896
About a year later, we wanted boss fights in the game.

363
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,878
We didn't really know what the bosses should be,

364
00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:00,040
and so we kind of combed back through all of our tooltips,

365
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:03,123
and we kept coming back to this bacon weed fairy.

366
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,545
We thought, this has to be a boss fight.

367
00:17:06,805 --> 00:17:10,907
So we created a huge elaborate quest chain that the players go through,

368
00:17:11,387 --> 00:17:14,348
and at the end of that quest chain they confront the Baconweed Fairy,

369
00:17:15,028 --> 00:17:18,950
whom they have to defeat to get a healing trinket that's one of the best items in the game.

370
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,791
And the Baconweed Fairy is a crazy bullet hell fight

371
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,452
that changes everything about the way players think about the game,

372
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:28,133
and it's also one of the coolest moments that we see

373
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,754
whenever YouTubers or streamers play the game

374
00:17:30,954 --> 00:17:35,155
because they're so surprised and taken aback by this, as you would expect.

375
00:17:35,976 --> 00:17:40,297
So the way that you then go about creating story using this design process

376
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:42,958
is, for starters, don't worry about it.

377
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:47,640
Finish the game first, because the game is the setting for your story.

378
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,361
So just as the game takes shape over time,

379
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:56,264
you're just going to be looking around for little pieces of hints at a story.

380
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,505
You're just going to pick them up and weave them together

381
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:03,767
and just kind of let those stories emerge from this weird thing that you made.

382
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,074
And above all, when you're telling your stories,

383
00:18:07,634 --> 00:18:08,815
be unapologetic about it.

384
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,077
Just let the game tell the stories that it wants to tell

385
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:15,000
and don't try to force it to be something that it's not

386
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,242
because maybe it's too zany or too weird or whatever.

387
00:18:18,642 --> 00:18:21,405
Because as long as you interpret the game honestly

388
00:18:21,485 --> 00:18:23,786
as it seems to be interpreted,

389
00:18:24,287 --> 00:18:26,428
you're gonna end up with something that fits really well

390
00:18:26,649 --> 00:18:28,030
and is also very interesting to players.

391
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,713
So that's our whole design process.

392
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:35,735
So as a quick recap of the main points,

393
00:18:36,476 --> 00:18:38,177
in case you guys want to take a snapshot of it,

394
00:18:38,197 --> 00:18:39,538
you can I guess use your phones for that.

395
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,340
So for starters, ideas don't matter, don't worry about it.

396
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,461
Just start making stuff.

397
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,603
Quit worrying so much, that's just in general,

398
00:18:47,683 --> 00:18:48,384
just life advice.

399
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:51,646
Don't plan everything or anything if you can help it

400
00:18:51,706 --> 00:18:53,687
because you can't know the future

401
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:55,368
and you're gonna waste time planning

402
00:18:55,408 --> 00:18:56,809
and then waste time being wrong later.

403
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,670
So don't do that.

404
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,901
Also don't sweat the small stuff.

405
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:01,762
Also don't sweat the big stuff either.

406
00:19:01,802 --> 00:19:02,582
Just stop sweating.

407
00:19:02,882 --> 00:19:03,863
It's not a good look.

408
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:07,604
Speed is your best friend, so focus on that

409
00:19:07,904 --> 00:19:09,205
and everything else will fall into place.

410
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:12,386
And don't worry about trying to tell stories in your games.

411
00:19:12,846 --> 00:19:14,527
Just find them, because they're just laying around.

412
00:19:14,727 --> 00:19:15,347
So just pick them up.

413
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:17,949
All right, thank you guys very much.

414
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:19,049
Appreciate it.

415
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:31,773
Also, we do have a podcast at our studio, which we talk about this kind of stuff all the time.

416
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:33,913
So if you'd like to check that out, we have a link up there.

417
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:35,914
If you want to find me on Twitter, you cannot.

418
00:19:36,274 --> 00:19:38,075
So, good luck.

419
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:41,096
Alright, does anybody have questions?

420
00:19:41,656 --> 00:19:41,796
Yeah.

421
00:19:46,058 --> 00:19:46,998
So, great talk, thanks.

422
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:50,120
You mentioned in the beginning, we were like four people.

423
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,340
Was it bigger afterwards?

424
00:19:52,841 --> 00:19:54,941
We started it as two, and we are now four.

425
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,490
And do you think it would work for a much bigger team, 20 or more?

426
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,951
I simply cannot say.

427
00:20:00,971 --> 00:20:07,375
I think one of the things that's really important for our design style is autonomy, where it's

428
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,596
sort of like, we do things by targets.

429
00:20:10,096 --> 00:20:14,519
So some general idea needs to happen, like with the Wompit example, we just have our

430
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:18,261
checklist for our artist, and we don't care what comes out, as long as it meets those

431
00:20:18,441 --> 00:20:18,961
requirements.

432
00:20:19,742 --> 00:20:21,623
And so he made that thing and we put it in

433
00:20:23,044 --> 00:20:25,045
without any oversight really or anything like that.

434
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:27,006
So I think it can work with a larger team,

435
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:30,027
but you would need people who you really trust

436
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:32,009
to be that autonomous.

437
00:20:33,249 --> 00:20:37,051
But at the same time, I think the larger a team gets,

438
00:20:37,332 --> 00:20:39,253
you know, the more people want to know what's happening

439
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:41,694
and the more planning you seem to need.

440
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:45,696
So one of the questions people rarely ask is, you know,

441
00:20:45,836 --> 00:20:48,058
how small can we just keep our team?

442
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:49,898
or do we need a team this big?

443
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,059
And what if we split the team

444
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:52,780
and make two games at the same time, right?

445
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,761
So I think, I can't say,

446
00:20:56,441 --> 00:21:00,103
but I've never been that comfortable on large teams anyways,

447
00:21:00,243 --> 00:21:01,064
so who knows.

448
00:21:02,104 --> 00:21:02,744
Thanks. Thanks.

449
00:21:04,285 --> 00:21:04,425
Yep.

450
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,186
Yeah, so I just want to thank you for...

451
00:21:07,745 --> 00:21:09,646
all the hours that I spent playing this game,

452
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:10,266
it was awesome.

453
00:21:10,306 --> 00:21:11,087
Yeah, no problem.

454
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,588
I wanted to ask about,

455
00:21:13,608 --> 00:21:15,209
I really fell in love with the creatures,

456
00:21:15,929 --> 00:21:17,950
and especially that embiggening moment.

457
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:18,671
Yes.

458
00:21:18,771 --> 00:21:21,793
Can you talk about the design process that led to that?

459
00:21:21,973 --> 00:21:24,654
Yeah, so that design process was just this,

460
00:21:24,714 --> 00:21:26,315
but I'll kind of recap how it went,

461
00:21:26,395 --> 00:21:29,037
which is, so we have a moment in Crashlands

462
00:21:29,077 --> 00:21:30,798
where you can collect items,

463
00:21:30,938 --> 00:21:33,739
and then you can create this weird thing for each creature,

464
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:35,000
and you can give it to the creature.

465
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,641
and we do sort of like a Pokemon style,

466
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:40,062
you know, it flashes on screen,

467
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:41,482
what, it's evolving or whatever.

468
00:21:42,283 --> 00:21:44,784
But then, at the moment that it's about to evolve,

469
00:21:45,324 --> 00:21:47,645
we flip the screen into this crazy view

470
00:21:47,705 --> 00:21:49,585
with weird words flying across the screen

471
00:21:49,605 --> 00:21:51,546
and we turn on some dubstep,

472
00:21:51,566 --> 00:21:53,747
and then the creature just kind of flies in your face

473
00:21:53,787 --> 00:21:56,708
a whole bunch, and big words flash on the screen saying,

474
00:21:56,808 --> 00:21:59,129
creature embiggened, and that's,

475
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:01,510
and then it just happens for a few seconds

476
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,490
and then it just goes away,

477
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,031
where the player's kind of going like, what?

478
00:22:05,271 --> 00:22:06,052
what just happened.

479
00:22:06,232 --> 00:22:08,393
I would literally, when I was playing this game

480
00:22:08,454 --> 00:22:09,995
on my commute, I'd be like, oh god,

481
00:22:10,035 --> 00:22:11,776
I can't watch this on the bus

482
00:22:11,856 --> 00:22:13,417
because I wanted to save it for home.

483
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:16,019
Yeah, and that became one of those special moments.

484
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:19,481
And so where that came from was actually,

485
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:21,463
I had been doing the programming for this

486
00:22:21,843 --> 00:22:23,484
and Sam had created some of the art

487
00:22:23,564 --> 00:22:25,305
for this embiggening scene.

488
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:28,847
And we originally just had some very mundane music,

489
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:30,027
and I'm sitting there programming it,

490
00:22:30,047 --> 00:22:32,008
and I thought, this isn't anything.

491
00:22:32,348 --> 00:22:35,389
So I kind of snipped up some Skrillex or something.

492
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:38,210
I just threw it in there just as sort of a demo.

493
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,951
And I didn't tell Sam about it.

494
00:22:41,711 --> 00:22:43,592
And so then he was playtesting the game,

495
00:22:44,092 --> 00:22:45,312
and then he just started screaming.

496
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:49,233
So we were like, yep, that's the thing.

497
00:22:49,874 --> 00:22:52,636
But again, that just came through interpreting the game

498
00:22:52,676 --> 00:22:54,037
and just saying, this isn't good enough.

499
00:22:54,338 --> 00:22:55,719
This isn't hitting what we needed to hit.

500
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,000
We need a joke here.

501
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,062
And so that's where that came from.

502
00:23:00,443 --> 00:23:00,543
Yep.

503
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:08,451
Hi, I'm wondering about playtesting your game and if you guys do any playtesting with players

504
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:09,532
outside your studio.

505
00:23:09,992 --> 00:23:14,173
In specific you talked about the floors and how players weren't using the floors.

506
00:23:14,553 --> 00:23:15,413
Who are the players?

507
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:18,334
If the game wasn't out yet, who's playing it?

508
00:23:18,374 --> 00:23:24,936
We do a series of testing moments where at the very beginning we will just do one-on-one

509
00:23:24,976 --> 00:23:28,597
sit-downs where we'll bring in somebody who's never seen the game before, who isn't afraid

510
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:30,057
to tell us that they hate it.

511
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:33,678
And we don't ever ask them questions.

512
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:36,979
We just sit down with them, and as they play,

513
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:39,480
we just take notes and just watch what they're doing

514
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,081
and see if our ideas are actually landing.

515
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:43,961
Because it's easy as a developer to say,

516
00:23:43,981 --> 00:23:47,962
here comes the funny part, and then they're going to be like,

517
00:23:48,182 --> 00:23:49,163
huh, and try to, you know.

518
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,004
like when you show a friend a YouTube video

519
00:23:51,024 --> 00:23:53,205
and then there's that painful experience.

520
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:56,647
So we don't do that, we just observe.

521
00:23:56,847 --> 00:23:58,667
And so we do that early on in development

522
00:23:58,968 --> 00:24:01,429
and then later on we reach out to our community of players

523
00:24:02,689 --> 00:24:04,830
and we do sort of a small alpha.

524
00:24:05,684 --> 00:24:08,768
where, because these are sort of our bigger fans and they are very

525
00:24:08,788 --> 00:24:09,469
uh...

526
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:13,555
sort of forgiving of if the game crashes or has terrible bugs or whatever.

527
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:18,081
So we do that and then we do a much bigger beta later on through invites.

528
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:19,283
So yeah, we do have a pretty

529
00:24:20,745 --> 00:24:22,667
stepwise testing process that we go through.

530
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:30,119
So I love iteration, I love prototypes. I agree that that's how you make your games not suck.

531
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,301
So that's awesome. What I've noticed happening on development teams that I've been part of is

532
00:24:36,401 --> 00:24:39,502
that 40 iterations down the road you're like, oh, we're going to implement this feature,

533
00:24:39,522 --> 00:24:42,784
it's going to, we're going to test it today. And you're like, a week later you're like, wow,

534
00:24:42,824 --> 00:24:46,525
that was a lot harder to implement because there's a whole lot of code in here that's kind

535
00:24:46,565 --> 00:24:53,688
of bad. And so at what point or if ever do you be like, all right, we like what we've got,

536
00:24:54,788 --> 00:24:58,630
tear it down, build it the right way so that we can continue prototyping because

537
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,290
now our momentum is being sucked.

538
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:04,372
Yeah, so one of the key ideas that you want to hit when you're going

539
00:25:04,392 --> 00:25:05,192
through these iterations

540
00:25:05,652 --> 00:25:08,393
is trying to get the current state of the game to be in a really good spot.

541
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:13,035
So, as opposed to saying, you know, the game doesn't feel very good, but if we just add

542
00:25:13,115 --> 00:25:15,835
ten new systems, I feel like that's going to do it, you know,

543
00:25:16,576 --> 00:25:20,317
because now you're six months down the road, you're going to get all those systems

544
00:25:20,337 --> 00:25:24,178
done and the game is worse now because it has a bunch of systems with no content.

545
00:25:24,918 --> 00:25:38,161
So one of the things we've noticed happening when we do these iterations is that if we leave a sort of a stone unturned where we leave some kind of a weak special effect or something that just doesn't feel good to use,

546
00:25:38,661 --> 00:25:48,783
then we will go ahead and forge ahead without that thing and we'll just keep developing the game and leave that poor underused system behind because it just wasn't doing what we needed.

547
00:25:49,564 --> 00:25:51,346
And so that's not good, right?

548
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:53,228
Because now you have a system that a player will encounter

549
00:25:53,629 --> 00:25:56,412
thinking, this is going to be great, and then it's just kind of bland

550
00:25:56,452 --> 00:25:57,654
and then they just forget about it.

551
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:01,198
So we've really tried to take seriously the idea of

552
00:26:01,318 --> 00:26:03,321
whatever you put in the game, nail it.

553
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,744
So a lot of people try to save polish for last.

554
00:26:06,505 --> 00:26:09,485
And I think if you do that under the iterative cycle,

555
00:26:10,025 --> 00:26:13,566
then you're gonna end up just with a lot of sad systems

556
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:14,706
that have never been finished

557
00:26:15,086 --> 00:26:16,487
because you didn't wanna use them,

558
00:26:16,547 --> 00:26:17,927
you didn't wanna explore them,

559
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:19,467
and you didn't wanna play with them

560
00:26:19,547 --> 00:26:21,927
to do your comparisons to your vision.

561
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:24,328
So you should always try to shore up your systems

562
00:26:24,348 --> 00:26:25,668
to be in the best possible state

563
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:28,689
before you think about moving to the next thing.

564
00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:32,829
Got time for, yep.

565
00:26:32,909 --> 00:26:33,710
I wanted to ask.

566
00:26:35,151 --> 00:26:36,592
Why do you use Game Maker Studio?

567
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,133
I mean, I'm a master race myself for that,

568
00:26:38,313 --> 00:26:40,474
but I wanted to ask why do y'all in particular?

569
00:26:40,494 --> 00:26:43,176
Because it's the best.

570
00:26:43,256 --> 00:26:46,118
We've tried using lots of other engines for 2D development,

571
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:49,079
and we found that we just can't do anything faster

572
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,740
than we can do in Game Maker Studio.

573
00:26:51,161 --> 00:26:54,683
We've actually, we've even done a series of jams

574
00:26:54,723 --> 00:26:56,244
where every Monday we started a game

575
00:26:56,264 --> 00:26:57,284
at eight o'clock in the morning

576
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,785
and had it published on Google Play by 6 p.m.

577
00:26:59,946 --> 00:27:04,030
with a full set of loops, in-app purchases, the whole thing.

578
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:06,052
Some of those games even got featured.

579
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:10,577
And so with that kind of speed, since that

580
00:27:10,637 --> 00:27:13,039
is our primary concern using this development style,

581
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:15,742
we just have to go with whatever tool lets us do

582
00:27:15,822 --> 00:27:17,203
what we want to do the fastest.

583
00:27:17,684 --> 00:27:20,046
And that just comes to be Game Maker Studio.

584
00:27:24,037 --> 00:27:28,485
So with your iterative process, I guess you said you you're trying to just cut out as much planning as you can

585
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:32,692
how do you know when you're getting to that point where you're ready to launch and I guess if you're just always kind of

586
00:27:33,355 --> 00:27:35,696
Yeah, you can always keep going, right?

587
00:27:35,977 --> 00:27:36,177
Right.

588
00:27:36,797 --> 00:27:39,278
Yeah, it basically just amounts to, for us,

589
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:41,359
you just gotta kinda feel it out.

590
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:42,860
So, sort of, a lot of it comes down

591
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,520
to comparing the game to the vision, right?

592
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,341
And when you feel like you've just hit everything

593
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:50,643
that you wanted to hit, you gotta wrap it up and move on,

594
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:53,344
because you will just run out of money at some point,

595
00:27:54,104 --> 00:27:55,425
or people will just lose patience.

596
00:27:55,745 --> 00:27:56,886
So, if you're trying to build up hype

597
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:58,626
at the beginning of your dev cycle

598
00:27:58,686 --> 00:27:59,747
for your fans or whatever,

599
00:28:01,228 --> 00:28:04,530
and then it takes six years because you just gotta get it right,

600
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:06,551
then you're gonna have a hard time.

601
00:28:06,631 --> 00:28:08,933
And that's partially where the good enough principle comes in as well,

602
00:28:09,393 --> 00:28:14,176
where you have to be willing to accept that perfection is impossible to attain,

603
00:28:14,356 --> 00:28:18,539
and once something is good, and good enough that your players will really be into it,

604
00:28:18,859 --> 00:28:20,200
then you move on to the next thing.

605
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:26,945
If you have a lot of ideas, do you ever have a hard time deciding which ones to prototype?

606
00:28:27,845 --> 00:28:29,066
Uh, nope.

607
00:28:32,741 --> 00:28:35,303
We don't really have a lot of ideas.

608
00:28:35,983 --> 00:28:39,805
We just throw stuff at the wall, and then it's...

609
00:28:40,025 --> 00:28:40,946
So we just...

610
00:28:41,046 --> 00:28:42,186
We kind of operate on action.

611
00:28:43,227 --> 00:28:44,868
As soon as somebody says, what if we did this?

612
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,608
And we go, okay.

613
00:28:45,688 --> 00:28:49,350
And then there's a prototype within six hours, and then that just sort of...

614
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,413
becomes whatever the next game is.

615
00:28:52,653 --> 00:28:56,136
And so, I know a lot of people have binders and binders

616
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:58,879
full of ideas, laying around their studios and stuff.

617
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:01,202
We are, our studio is very Spartan, there's just nothing.

618
00:29:01,602 --> 00:29:03,624
We don't have any ideas at all, so.

619
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:04,525
Yeah.

620
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:06,988
Anybody else?

621
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:10,251
Okay, thank you very much guys, appreciate it.
