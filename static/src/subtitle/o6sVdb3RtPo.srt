1
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:22,240
Hello everybody, I am here to welcome all of you awesome GDCers, my fellow GDC UX goblins,

2
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,824
and I am here to talk about the elephant in the room, right?

3
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:32,528
is UX.

4
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:33,430
Right?

5
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:34,131
Okay.

6
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:37,696
So, you know, who am I to tell you this?

7
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:38,798
Who the F am I?

8
00:00:38,918 --> 00:00:39,138
Right?

9
00:00:39,298 --> 00:00:41,602
Why are you here to hear me talk?

10
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:41,922
Right?

11
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:43,565
So my name is Samus Wolf.

12
00:00:44,206 --> 00:00:47,110
I am the senior UX researcher at the AbleGamers charity.

13
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:51,832
Which, by the way, at the end of this slideshow, I'll have a code word for you.

14
00:00:51,972 --> 00:00:56,294
And if you go to our website, which is also at the end of this slideshow, you can enter

15
00:00:56,354 --> 00:00:58,535
your name to win some super cool swag.

16
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:00,416
So keep your eye out for that.

17
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,637
I'm also a mentor at Springboard.

18
00:01:04,477 --> 00:01:06,018
I'm a feral UX engineer.

19
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:08,338
You can see me out in the wild doing UX things.

20
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:11,059
I have a master's degree in user experience design.

21
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,164
And I have over seven years of UX job experience.

22
00:01:15,184 --> 00:01:19,369
Specifically, I'm a druid, I'm an animal wrangler,

23
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:22,112
I'm a horse girl, which is a gender neutral term,

24
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:23,213
as far as I'm concerned.

25
00:01:23,874 --> 00:01:28,399
And what ho, a UX unicorn, right?

26
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,121
The mythical, the magical.

27
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:30,942
So.

28
00:01:32,184 --> 00:01:43,934
I don't really advertise myself as like professionally a UX unicorn, which is kind of cringe to begin with, but also because I don't really resonate with being a unicorn either.

29
00:01:43,954 --> 00:01:47,658
And the reason of this is the state of the UX job market.

30
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:51,041
So to be frank, UX job market.

31
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:52,770
It sucks.

32
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,432
It's just kind of a mess, right?

33
00:01:54,952 --> 00:02:02,521
So being a unicorn or what really you are as an experienced generalist is not the flex

34
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:03,402
that people think it is.

35
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:07,827
And it's a huge cause of burnout in the industry, which I'm going to kind of touch on.

36
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:11,329
So I'm going to talk a little bit about my journey, right?

37
00:02:11,749 --> 00:02:16,833
So prior to AbleGamers, I started as a graphics specialist.

38
00:02:17,353 --> 00:02:18,934
I moved into web development.

39
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:21,996
I moved into being a UX professional.

40
00:02:22,436 --> 00:02:24,217
Then I became a full stack developer.

41
00:02:24,998 --> 00:02:27,179
And finally, a UX engineer.

42
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,443
So I worked and UXed in a lot of non-gaming related industries.

43
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:33,744
I did fintech.

44
00:02:33,864 --> 00:02:34,764
I did banking.

45
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:36,185
I did industrial stuff.

46
00:02:36,746 --> 00:02:38,086
I worked for non-profits.

47
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:42,969
Get the picture? Lots of different things. As you can see, definitely not on the Skyrim map.

48
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:48,553
Right? Okay. Because of my background in web development and then full stack development

49
00:02:48,593 --> 00:02:54,716
eventually, visual design and also UX, I was very successful in my roles. You know,

50
00:02:54,756 --> 00:02:58,499
I could do everything. Right? So I worked on a lot of projects end to end.

51
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:06,086
And here's the thing. This is my toxic trait. I loved it. I loved doing that. I loved being

52
00:03:06,566 --> 00:03:12,772
at the beginning with ideation and at the end with development and release. I absolutely had the time

53
00:03:12,952 --> 00:03:15,855
of my freaking life, okay? So...

54
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:22,427
Besides being passionate about gaming, I had no experience in the gaming industry.

55
00:03:22,908 --> 00:03:30,454
I came into the gaming industry freshly out of being a designer and developer for an industrial

56
00:03:30,574 --> 00:03:31,335
enterprise setting.

57
00:03:32,195 --> 00:03:37,578
So besides being passionate about gaming and, you know, improving that end user experience,

58
00:03:38,499 --> 00:03:43,242
when I started interviewing for roles in studios, the hardest part of that for me was proving that

59
00:03:43,402 --> 00:03:48,885
I was a good fit for the field and that I could understand gaming industry-specific challenges

60
00:03:49,045 --> 00:03:50,606
and also solve them, right?

61
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:55,504
So the job market, as I've listed here,

62
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:57,785
there's a couple of things that I'm going to sort of touch on

63
00:03:58,325 --> 00:03:59,545
and discuss with you guys.

64
00:04:00,026 --> 00:04:03,527
So being a unicorn or an advanced or experienced

65
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,468
generalist, it opens a lot of doors.

66
00:04:06,928 --> 00:04:08,229
I know the process from beginning to end.

67
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:10,750
Like I said, I've done the ideation, the research,

68
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,251
the idea pitching, the wire framing, the magic, the design,

69
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:16,552
sorcery, all of that stuff.

70
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:20,676
You know, I was project managing all of these projects as well.

71
00:04:21,156 --> 00:04:23,339
As you can imagine, that was a lot.

72
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:24,580
It was super fun.

73
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,240
I loved it.

74
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:28,043
But the pros did not outweigh the cons.

75
00:04:28,764 --> 00:04:31,967
And in the end, the cons snuck up on me like Solid Snake.

76
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:33,288
He was there.

77
00:04:33,308 --> 00:04:35,851
I burned out.

78
00:04:36,804 --> 00:04:42,406
Real bad. I became stressed. Finally had a reason to stress eat. You know, like you're just like,

79
00:04:42,446 --> 00:04:50,870
yeah, that mac and cheese? Five boxes. It's fun. I really just couldn't do it anymore. I decided

80
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,852
that I wanted to focus on one role, one UX role. I was just like, just pick one. Take your hand out

81
00:04:54,892 --> 00:05:00,575
of all the cookie jars. Pick one role. And I've been a super happy researcher since loving my

82
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,855
work with the AbleGamers charity.

83
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:09,340
So here's the thing. The job market is riddled with UX generalist positions. They're all looking

84
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:14,624
for unicorns and these are masquerading as different things. So even positions that are

85
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:21,828
meant to focus on a single role, they end up having attributes and are misdirected or bloated

86
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:26,931
with conflicting attributes of other parts of UX and companies.

87
00:05:28,012 --> 00:05:32,813
Just don't know how to hire a UX professional or look for a UX professional.

88
00:05:33,773 --> 00:05:39,254
So it falls on us to figure out, like, where our next gig is and how to translate the job

89
00:05:39,274 --> 00:05:46,436
description into something that makes sense. So what is a UX professional? You might ask

90
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:51,817
yourself, well, wait, I've only heard of UX designers or product designers. What is the

91
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:54,898
other stuff you're talking about, Samus? You're crazy. So...

92
00:05:56,432 --> 00:05:57,872
There's a ton of names, right?

93
00:05:57,892 --> 00:06:00,354
A rose by any other name is just,

94
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:02,995
smell sweeter, whatever the Romeo and Juliet says.

95
00:06:04,336 --> 00:06:06,177
There's all these titles and even more.

96
00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:08,799
It's kind of a lot. It's kind of overwhelming.

97
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:11,200
Don't really know what to do with all these names, right?

98
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:14,062
Sometimes you just look at them and disassociate for hours.

99
00:06:14,462 --> 00:06:15,083
At least that's what I do.

100
00:06:16,906 --> 00:06:22,908
So here's the thing. I define UX professionalism with three things. Okay. And this is something I

101
00:06:22,928 --> 00:06:27,550
talk to my mentees about quite often. One is kind of the objective thing. You know,

102
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,571
you're a professional who incorporates or manages feedback directly or indirectly

103
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:37,774
into the product lifecycle. Two, you're an empathetic human being who cares deeply

104
00:06:38,294 --> 00:06:39,895
about the end user of your product.

105
00:06:41,187 --> 00:06:43,789
However, the most important point is number three,

106
00:06:44,309 --> 00:06:48,832
someone who has the desire to use technology for good.

107
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:52,655
This, I tell every single one of my students

108
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:54,536
the minute they meet me as their mentor

109
00:06:55,036 --> 00:06:56,437
that this is the most important thing

110
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,200
because there's a ton about the industry

111
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,462
that really gets caught up in this mess

112
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:05,343
of chaotic stuff in the beginning

113
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,805
and we really don't talk about how important.

114
00:07:08,445 --> 00:07:13,408
It is to use technology for good. And how that's a huge part of UX, right?

115
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:18,971
So people who want to break in the gaming industry, it's hard to do that with all this

116
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:21,532
competition, right? So UX folks...

117
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:23,475
Here's the thing.

118
00:07:24,055 --> 00:07:26,578
We don't necessarily have the same experience

119
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,242
in our background as other people in the gaming industry.

120
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,344
For example, software development,

121
00:07:32,424 --> 00:07:34,606
project management, illustration and design,

122
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:38,130
all of that stuff that makes up other parts of gaming studios.

123
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,713
There's a lot more direct formal education paths than UX.

124
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:45,977
Like, don't get me wrong, I have a master's degree in user experience design.

125
00:07:46,777 --> 00:07:52,101
And I absolutely loved my program. I would recommend a master's degree to anyone.

126
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:55,483
But also, I understand that it's kind of a rare thing now.

127
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:59,506
There's a ton of UX professionals out there who have formal education and training,

128
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,087
who have been around for a long time.

129
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,949
But usually what happens is...

130
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:08,111
To learn about UX, you are in an adjacent industry,

131
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:14,153
and then you hear from your brother's, girlfriend's, dog groomer's best friend that UX exists.

132
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:19,796
Right? So it's kind of something that you stumble upon rather than you hear about in high school.

133
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:26,452
So here's the thing, and I bring up the Nielsen Norman group because as we all do as UXers,

134
00:08:26,532 --> 00:08:30,953
love the Nielsen Norman group, they have this awesome chart of how many UX professionals,

135
00:08:31,713 --> 00:08:37,495
just UX professionals, the whole thing, there are in the world. So we're in the 2020 range,

136
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:45,098
or at least I think we are, time's a soup. And so like Nielsen Norman says that there's about

137
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,659
maybe a million UX professionals in the world right now.

138
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:50,412
Okay, sounds like a big number, right?

139
00:08:50,452 --> 00:08:51,192
You know, you're just kind of like,

140
00:08:51,212 --> 00:08:52,973
that's a lot, Samus, what are you talking about?

141
00:08:53,713 --> 00:08:54,934
We don't need any more UX people.

142
00:08:55,694 --> 00:08:56,114
Here's the thing.

143
00:08:56,815 --> 00:08:57,515
Software engineers.

144
00:08:58,456 --> 00:09:00,677
I believe that UX is kind of a one-to-one

145
00:09:00,937 --> 00:09:01,877
with software engineering.

146
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:05,479
In the USA alone, there's almost four and a half million.

147
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:07,260
That's a lot.

148
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,501
And in the world, there's almost 27 million.

149
00:09:12,262 --> 00:09:13,682
Where's all the UX people, guys?

150
00:09:13,843 --> 00:09:15,383
Come on, where we at?

151
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:16,744
So now.

152
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:18,890
We all love personas, right?

153
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:19,911
We're all jazzed.

154
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,932
We're all going to be doing some job hunting.

155
00:09:21,972 --> 00:09:22,773
We got a persona.

156
00:09:23,093 --> 00:09:23,974
They're ready to go.

157
00:09:24,374 --> 00:09:26,296
This is where I'm going to have you guys come in.

158
00:09:26,336 --> 00:09:27,857
I'm going to ask you all some questions,

159
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,838
and hopefully we're going to get the ball rolling

160
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:30,779
on some job hunting.

161
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,902
So let's describe our persona, right?

162
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:35,263
Okay.

163
00:09:36,183 --> 00:09:38,845
They're motivated by pivoting from their current industry.

164
00:09:38,865 --> 00:09:40,126
They're not happy with their current industry.

165
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,628
They're just like, I want to leave.

166
00:09:42,088 --> 00:09:43,889
They want to work for a game studio because they like games.

167
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,262
They want to, they need to find the right position for them,

168
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:51,243
right, because there's a ton and it's kind of a soup out there.

169
00:09:51,964 --> 00:09:54,005
They want to understand the UX industry better

170
00:09:54,025 --> 00:09:54,925
because they are pivoting.

171
00:09:55,426 --> 00:09:57,907
Their pain points are the vagueness of the industry

172
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:02,169
and the rejections as we have all had from the gaming industry

173
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,830
because they don't have experience.

174
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,371
That's painful.

175
00:10:06,351 --> 00:10:07,612
All right, and then there's the other stuff.

176
00:10:07,952 --> 00:10:09,793
Okay, so they're female.

177
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:11,794
She's a scientist.

178
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:13,034
She's always caffeinated.

179
00:10:13,094 --> 00:10:13,655
She's goth.

180
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:14,555
Yeah, it's Abby.

181
00:10:17,376 --> 00:10:22,199
So Abby has decided that being a forensic scientist is super cool and everything,

182
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:28,582
but she has all of these talents in interviewing and computer science and analyzing human behavior

183
00:10:29,082 --> 00:10:32,705
and just really sexy UX traits, right?

184
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,867
So Abby's decided that NTS is dumb and boring and she's going to leave.

185
00:10:37,407 --> 00:10:38,628
She's ready to...

186
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:42,610
Get away from the Navy, which she does in 2018, so this is fine.

187
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:44,571
She has a career gap.

188
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:45,732
It's okay, though.

189
00:10:46,932 --> 00:10:52,135
And she is wanting to become a UX researcher for the video game industry.

190
00:10:52,675 --> 00:10:53,476
She plays MMO.

191
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:54,796
She plays first-person shooters.

192
00:10:55,197 --> 00:11:02,200
She thinks of herself as a well-qualified person to become an expert in the gaming user

193
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,721
experience division.

194
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:09,129
Abby's scrolling through Indeed, as we all do, you know, in bed.

195
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,671
That's doom scrolling for me, at least sometimes.

196
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:14,274
Don't doom scroll TikTok.

197
00:11:14,314 --> 00:11:15,215
Doom scroll Indeed.

198
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:19,218
And she comes across a few job listings that she's interested in.

199
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,480
Here's the thing.

200
00:11:22,301 --> 00:11:24,603
Abby wants to work primarily as a researcher.

201
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,405
That's where she feels she shines.

202
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:27,266
So.

203
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:35,825
While she can do the enhance on the picture that has two pixels, and design and photoshopping,

204
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:40,187
and she can do hacking and coding, what can't she do really?

205
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:42,508
Let's be honest.

206
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,489
She doesn't want that to be the main part of her role.

207
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,651
It's fine if it's a part of it, but she wants to primarily do research.

208
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:52,433
And she also wants to be involved directly with users

209
00:11:52,473 --> 00:11:53,554
and analyzing their behavior,

210
00:11:53,574 --> 00:11:55,375
because she thinks that's just super freaking cool.

211
00:11:55,955 --> 00:11:59,557
So, here are the companies that the jobs we're going

212
00:11:59,577 --> 00:12:00,998
to be looking at have come from.

213
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:05,421
Job number one, it's called UX Researcher.

214
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:08,323
She probably liked it because it's called UX Researcher, right?

215
00:12:09,003 --> 00:12:13,366
So, I'm going to ask you guys, on this job description,

216
00:12:14,346 --> 00:12:15,767
what do you guys think is a red flag?

217
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:18,309
You shout it out.

218
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:20,961
Three years of experience, okay.

219
00:12:23,382 --> 00:12:23,542
So.

220
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:25,843
Ag, okay, okay.

221
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:26,824
Thank you, yes.

222
00:12:27,644 --> 00:12:28,144
Anybody else?

223
00:12:33,706 --> 00:12:34,386
Yeah, okay.

224
00:12:38,288 --> 00:12:38,548
Yeah.

225
00:12:38,688 --> 00:12:38,968
Okay.

226
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:41,029
Anyone else?

227
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:51,008
Masters preferred. Yeah, okay, so Big Games Inc. is a AAA studio creating strategic FPS

228
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:58,551
games in the franchises Big Battles and Bang Bang Shoot Shoot. They're looking for someone

229
00:12:58,691 --> 00:13:03,973
with a whole lot of things, huh? You know, three years of experience. I literally, I'm

230
00:13:03,993 --> 00:13:07,674
going to be honest, I'm sorry recruiters out there, I tell all of my students to ignore

231
00:13:07,714 --> 00:13:11,235
that. I'm just like, nah, we're not even going to look at that, that's not a real number,

232
00:13:11,315 --> 00:13:11,475
bye.

233
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:14,977
So, and I'll talk about why later.

234
00:13:15,438 --> 00:13:19,861
But, additionally, somebody mentioned UX portfolio.

235
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:21,783
What does that mean?

236
00:13:22,724 --> 00:13:25,506
Like, so this is a researcher position, so case studies?

237
00:13:26,047 --> 00:13:26,847
Do you want case studies?

238
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:28,208
Do you want prototypes?

239
00:13:28,689 --> 00:13:29,790
What if I don't have prototypes?

240
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,390
What do you want?

241
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,912
That's really vague, and that kind of makes me nervous

242
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:35,094
that they don't know what a UX researcher does.

243
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,378
Somebody said, manage agile efforts.

244
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,881
Why is a researcher doing that?

245
00:13:42,842 --> 00:13:44,082
They should not be doing that.

246
00:13:44,502 --> 00:13:46,944
And the thing is, while these job listings are fake,

247
00:13:47,124 --> 00:13:49,105
all of the attributes of these job listings

248
00:13:49,145 --> 00:13:50,306
have come from real ones.

249
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:54,248
So master's degree preferred.

250
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,629
In research, I've seen this, and I get it.

251
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,351
But at the same time, when it's an entry-level position,

252
00:14:01,371 --> 00:14:03,653
it's a little goofy, in my opinion.

253
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:06,614
So basically, Abby looks at this, and she's just like, nah.

254
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:08,495
Nah, we ain't doing that.

255
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:09,916
So now.

256
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,739
Everybody, what do you think about this job position?

257
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:16,200
Red flags, anyone?

258
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:21,701
CSS3 HTML5 JavaScript.

259
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:22,501
Yeah, okay, all right.

260
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:23,241
Anybody else?

261
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:27,042
What was that?

262
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:30,023
Product design.

263
00:14:30,063 --> 00:14:32,243
Product design specialist, yes.

264
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:33,583
Anyone else?

265
00:14:39,836 --> 00:14:40,496
Yeah, OK.

266
00:14:40,957 --> 00:14:41,497
Anyone else?

267
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:44,839
All right.

268
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:50,502
So the first big red flag here is understanding of CSS3,

269
00:14:50,562 --> 00:14:52,123
HTML5, and JavaScript.

270
00:14:52,743 --> 00:14:53,104
I mean, why?

271
00:14:56,777 --> 00:15:04,963
So, as, and I can tell you, as a, in my, like, current state of being, I have no idea, but

272
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:10,867
a lot of, like, even outside of gaming, I've seen a lot of, like, UX roles be described

273
00:15:10,907 --> 00:15:13,909
as, like, please have these, you know, coding things.

274
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:14,970
Like, know how to code.

275
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,411
And I'm like, for what?

276
00:15:17,171 --> 00:15:17,652
What am I doing?

277
00:15:17,872 --> 00:15:18,412
What am I coding?

278
00:15:18,873 --> 00:15:19,053
Why?

279
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:19,293
No.

280
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:25,693
So that's a red flag for me. I'm just like, nah, I don't want to be doing coding. Abby doesn't want

281
00:15:25,713 --> 00:15:29,557
to do code. She wants to do research and potentially some design. So that's a no.

282
00:15:30,698 --> 00:15:35,123
The next thing is somebody mentioned intend research projects.

283
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:37,886
Like, in theory, okay.

284
00:15:38,406 --> 00:15:39,887
But also, what does that mean?

285
00:15:40,247 --> 00:15:44,209
Like, end-to-end of the project lifecycle in its, you know,

286
00:15:44,449 --> 00:15:44,929
entirety?

287
00:15:45,749 --> 00:15:49,271
Or, like, are we doing the research,

288
00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:52,513
projecting the methodologies, synthesizing the data?

289
00:15:52,553 --> 00:15:53,893
Like, what does that mean?

290
00:15:54,514 --> 00:15:57,095
And then, additionally, the title,

291
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:58,896
Product Design Specialist.

292
00:15:58,936 --> 00:16:00,156
This is a real title, you guys.

293
00:16:00,837 --> 00:16:02,457
I found this in the wild.

294
00:16:03,598 --> 00:16:04,299
What is that?

295
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:10,624
Like, I'm just, I like looked at it for like five whole minutes and like sipped my definitely alcoholic drink at the time.

296
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:13,366
And I said, that, that isn't real.

297
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,249
Like, you know, don't get me wrong, I like having cool titles.

298
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:19,351
I made a really cool title for myself when I was in my undergrad.

299
00:16:19,732 --> 00:16:22,294
I think it was, uh, interactive.

300
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:27,321
And learning, teaching, design specialist or something.

301
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,362
It was absolutely wild.

302
00:16:28,422 --> 00:16:30,605
But, you know, I was like 20 then.

303
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,748
This is the, I doubt that the person who made that title is 20.

304
00:16:33,788 --> 00:16:33,828
So.

305
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:37,790
All right, Abby's like, nah, this is too much.

306
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:39,030
And please, next one.

307
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:39,930
OK.

308
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,251
So she's getting a little desperate now.

309
00:16:42,491 --> 00:16:45,032
She's looking into the adjacent roles.

310
00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:48,853
UX UI Designer, OK, by WeMakeGames LLC.

311
00:16:49,113 --> 00:16:50,374
So this is a smaller company.

312
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:53,755
They have a bunch of different projects, from roguelikes,

313
00:16:53,855 --> 00:16:57,296
to racing, to card games, to mobile titles, right?

314
00:16:58,036 --> 00:16:58,236
OK.

315
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:00,637
What are the red flags here?

316
00:17:04,163 --> 00:17:05,803
Everybody's just like, why the code?

317
00:17:06,143 --> 00:17:10,664
By the way, I definitely copied and pasted that directly from my job description.

318
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:14,265
Yeah, so, okay, code, what else?

319
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:21,326
Yeah, yeah, that's a lot of things to be doing, right?

320
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:22,707
Okay, anybody else?

321
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,108
No, we don't need that in user experience.

322
00:17:27,408 --> 00:17:28,928
Didn't you get the memo?

323
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:30,908
What about everybody else?

324
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:31,188
Come on.

325
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:40,440
Yeah, you don't want to champion new ideas to the scary bigwigs that give you the money?

326
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:43,284
You don't want to be in charge of that as a UX UI designer?

327
00:17:43,504 --> 00:17:43,905
How dare?

328
00:17:43,925 --> 00:17:46,128
All right, what was that?

329
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:49,051
The next best thing.

330
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:52,515
That one I love because I've seen that in a few job descriptions and I'm just like,

331
00:17:52,536 --> 00:17:53,076
what does that mean?

332
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,196
Like, what am I in charge of?

333
00:17:55,436 --> 00:17:56,537
Like, solving world hunger?

334
00:17:58,198 --> 00:17:59,299
Please don't put that on me.

335
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,502
So Abby's looking at this, and Abby's like, wow,

336
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:04,723
this is really intense.

337
00:18:04,823 --> 00:18:06,904
Like, what on God's green earth am

338
00:18:06,964 --> 00:18:09,326
I going to do if I even get an interview with this company

339
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:10,387
because they're scary?

340
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:12,669
And I would say the same.

341
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,230
I wouldn't apply to this.

342
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,832
This sounds like it's 10 jobs rolled into one.

343
00:18:16,912 --> 00:18:18,273
That's way too much work.

344
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:20,549
Job number four.

345
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,110
Okay, this is our last job.

346
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,412
I'm not saying there's not red flags,

347
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:29,453
but what do you guys think would potentially

348
00:18:29,553 --> 00:18:30,874
be the problems here?

349
00:18:30,894 --> 00:18:36,136
Strong attention to detail.

350
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,257
Strong attention to detail, that is real vague.

351
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:41,299
Like we don't, we, anybody else?

352
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,361
Yeah, yeah.

353
00:18:47,969 --> 00:18:49,390
Yeah. Who knows, man?

354
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,652
You know, maybe you're sitting in the same room and looking at it, huh?

355
00:18:52,553 --> 00:18:52,953
Anybody else?

356
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:57,237
Yep. Development, life cycle.

357
00:18:57,477 --> 00:18:58,158
Okay. Okay.

358
00:18:58,518 --> 00:18:58,938
Anyone else?

359
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, that is kinda weird.

360
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,824
It sounds like this recruiter didn't really know what they were looking for, right?

361
00:19:10,844 --> 00:19:16,007
You know, this kind of sounds like they Googled UX designer and they just kind of copied some

362
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:16,888
stuff off of Google.

363
00:19:17,328 --> 00:19:17,609
All right.

364
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:20,170
Yeah, we can definitely, like, see that.

365
00:19:20,431 --> 00:19:25,034
And it makes sense because Indie Girl Games is a small startup.

366
00:19:25,074 --> 00:19:26,855
They don't know what they're looking for, really.

367
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:32,059
They want to produce really awesome romance sims, and this is definitely not influenced

368
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:33,980
by my favorite genre.

369
00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:39,807
And they want to have new and original stories that anyone can enjoy.

370
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:43,511
So they're a startup, they're baby, they don't know what they want.

371
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:51,460
But this job matches Abby the closest for her, not only her interests, but her skills.

372
00:19:52,591 --> 00:20:12,424
And we're going to kind of talk about that. So here's the thing. The next part of this, after you identify the job that you're like, vibing with, right, you have to sell yourself. We as UX professionals have to advocate for ourselves. We have a lot of skills, people who were in adjacent industries, and then they find interest in UX.

373
00:20:14,193 --> 00:20:19,622
The thing about that is we do have a lot of skills that translate, and I think a lot of

374
00:20:19,642 --> 00:20:23,288
people get caught up with the fact that it's not like a one-to-one exactly.

375
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,693
So guess what, guys?

376
00:20:27,174 --> 00:20:27,935
Self-validation.

377
00:20:27,955 --> 00:20:28,856
It's very important.

378
00:20:29,597 --> 00:20:33,341
This took me many, many years to hone.

379
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,642
I'm not perfect at it either.

380
00:20:34,782 --> 00:20:36,164
I need to think about it sometimes.

381
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:40,288
When I feel that imposter syndrome creeping up, I need to sit down and sort of count my

382
00:20:40,308 --> 00:20:44,873
blessings and remember that I am good at what I do.

383
00:20:45,914 --> 00:20:47,175
And Abby is empathetic.

384
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:51,738
There are many episodes that she's shown caring deeply for her team members.

385
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,742
She wants to, you know, she wants to get the people who are innocent out.

386
00:20:56,802 --> 00:20:58,463
She wants to find the bad guys.

387
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:03,226
She has a lot of passion for, you know, humans.

388
00:21:03,326 --> 00:21:05,207
Which, again, what's number three?

389
00:21:05,627 --> 00:21:08,269
Somebody who wants to use tech for good, right?

390
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:09,150
So.

391
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:16,696
She has a lot of experience. Like, she's very talented and skilled as an individual. And a lot

392
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:22,440
of this is done in other tech sectors. So, now what we need to do when we're formulating our

393
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:29,546
resumes is we need to put this through a lens of UX, put our experience through the lens of what

394
00:21:29,586 --> 00:21:36,891
a user experience professional would do, and then also relate it to how you would approach the

395
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:37,732
gaming industry.

396
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:40,834
Right? We need to show those strengths.

397
00:21:40,874 --> 00:21:42,175
We need to make them shine.

398
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:44,677
So this is her first resume.

399
00:21:45,257 --> 00:21:47,739
So I would say, and actually, you know what?

400
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:48,640
Take a look at this.

401
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,142
What do you think Abby could do to make it better?

402
00:21:57,245 --> 00:21:58,246
And it's okay if you don't know.

403
00:21:58,426 --> 00:21:59,687
We can, I can tell you.

404
00:21:59,707 --> 00:22:05,191
I think she'd be more concise on her skills.

405
00:22:05,211 --> 00:22:05,971
More concise?

406
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:06,071
Yes.

407
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:06,172
Okay.

408
00:22:12,407 --> 00:22:14,370
Grammar mistakes, yeah, okay, that's me.

409
00:22:16,693 --> 00:22:23,644
I also do tell all of my students to use Grammarly, which I clearly did not do, despite having

410
00:22:23,704 --> 00:22:25,046
a Grammarly business account.

411
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:26,528
It's fine, don't worry about it.

412
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,511
But yes, you're right.

413
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,112
Whoa, that's newfangled technology there, friend.

414
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,693
But not in this one.

415
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:42,254
No, she didn't.

416
00:22:56,063 --> 00:22:59,465
So, yeah, bullet points aren't goal-oriented, you know.

417
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:00,786
Like, that's important as well.

418
00:23:03,628 --> 00:23:04,709
Yes, you. Oh, both of you.

419
00:23:06,482 --> 00:23:08,123
You first, and then you.

420
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,712
Yup, bio doesn't show a lot of interest in UX.

421
00:23:18,752 --> 00:23:18,932
Yup.

422
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:29,302
Right, yeah, you know, putting the focus on that, right.

423
00:23:35,857 --> 00:23:37,198
Oh no, a recruiter's in here.

424
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:40,580
Oh, okay, right, yes.

425
00:23:43,543 --> 00:23:44,423
That is really scary.

426
00:23:44,563 --> 00:23:45,884
Yeah, it's kind of intimidating, right?

427
00:23:54,431 --> 00:23:57,213
Several pro, yeah, I know, it's a flex.

428
00:24:08,993 --> 00:24:10,373
Yeah, yep, that's a good point.

429
00:24:10,393 --> 00:24:14,555
I think skills aren't organized by relevance.

430
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:16,175
Yeah, yep, I would say so too.

431
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:21,698
Alright, so in the interest of time, because Abby does redo her resume,

432
00:24:21,758 --> 00:24:24,178
even though this resume is super impressive, right,

433
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:28,100
it has nothing to do with the UX position,

434
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:33,842
which we brought up, hey, maybe you should talk about what's in the job experience itself.

435
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:34,762
So, Abby.

436
00:24:36,656 --> 00:24:37,956
Revises her bio a little bit.

437
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:43,538
She talks about having expertise in various research methodologies instead of ballistics,

438
00:24:43,578 --> 00:24:44,558
instead of all that stuff.

439
00:24:45,378 --> 00:24:47,059
She talks about software development.

440
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:48,739
It's a lot vaguer now.

441
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,960
And also compiling and synthesizing highly sensitive research results.

442
00:24:53,501 --> 00:24:56,701
We took out the ballistics thing because that is super scary.

443
00:24:57,422 --> 00:25:01,643
And we kind of put in like, okay, interviewing and questioning.

444
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:06,886
You know, worked alongside IT development departments as a full stack dev.

445
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:12,550
Maybe that's a bit too much information, but it also lends credibility to, you know,

446
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,913
she knows these things and she's proud of knowing these things and she understands

447
00:25:15,953 --> 00:25:16,894
how to talk to developers.

448
00:25:18,094 --> 00:25:20,696
Created graphics, animations, and designs for internal

449
00:25:20,736 --> 00:25:21,916
and external procedures.

450
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:26,759
She elevated her certificate in UX design above her bachelor's.

451
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:31,802
And she also revised her skills to be more understanding

452
00:25:31,982 --> 00:25:33,503
of the job position itself.

453
00:25:35,344 --> 00:25:39,246
So all of this, right, what does it mean?

454
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:40,146
What does this mean?

455
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:46,140
If you're here at GDC, you want to help make the gaming community and industry a better place.

456
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,364
So regardless of the title that you have, the impact lies in the actions that you perform.

457
00:25:52,145 --> 00:25:56,468
If you are okay with having the title of UX designer, if the job includes generalism and

458
00:25:56,508 --> 00:26:04,315
encompasses the lifecycle of a product, that's fine. And maybe that UI UX job is primarily UI

459
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:09,039
with a little UX sprinkled in, and you think that's great. It's not about, like, I'm not saying

460
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:14,102
Don't do these jobs. Don't pick the jobs that have weird titles and, you know, like, have

461
00:26:14,402 --> 00:26:19,945
generalism in them. It's all about what you want to do, but you just want to be informed and you

462
00:26:19,985 --> 00:26:25,869
want to understand, okay, like, what am I going to ask in that interview? What am I going to

463
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:31,652
ask the team if I get past the recruiter phone call, you know, like, um,

464
00:26:32,392 --> 00:26:35,615
Am I going to ask about my role or like how relevant, you know,

465
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:38,377
HTML and CSS3 is for a researcher?

466
00:26:38,437 --> 00:26:40,499
Why is it in the position listing?

467
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:41,519
You know, all those things.

468
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,063
So I'm hoping that I've equipped you a little bit

469
00:26:46,403 --> 00:26:49,686
with another perspective on job hunting in the UX world.

470
00:26:50,507 --> 00:26:51,387
And the key takeaways.

471
00:26:51,687 --> 00:26:53,049
Believe in your experience.

472
00:26:53,389 --> 00:26:54,610
Tell your story.

473
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,991
Create empathy.

474
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:58,913
All of this should sound familiar if you're a UX person.

475
00:27:00,114 --> 00:27:05,958
Show that you want to be a part of the crowd using tech for good, and don't give up.

476
00:27:06,178 --> 00:27:09,601
That's the biggest thing. Don't give up. You will find a job out there. You will.

477
00:27:09,981 --> 00:27:12,503
You just have to look for the perfect position.

478
00:27:12,943 --> 00:27:16,745
You have to really sell yourself, and you have to want to use tech for good.

479
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:21,489
So, thanks. My code word is Metroid. Bet you didn't see that coming.

480
00:27:22,229 --> 00:27:29,652
And there's all the URLs for our adjacent services at the AbleGamers charity. I am,

481
00:27:29,832 --> 00:27:35,694
again, the senior UX researcher, so please take a look at those. Go to GDC 2023 to enter the code

482
00:27:35,714 --> 00:27:40,935
to win a swag bag. Feel free to email me for whatever, you know, gossip. I'm here for that.

483
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:48,358
And follow me on Twitter and find me on LinkedIn. Thank you guys so much. And I know that we have

484
00:27:48,718 --> 00:27:50,238
three minutes for questions, so I'll take like two.

485
00:27:55,869 --> 00:28:06,071
Also, fill out your evaluation forms, but be really nice because I'm fragile.

486
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:10,292
Not fragile, no. I'm not French or Italian, whatever that is.

487
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:15,774
Anyways, yeah, so I will also be in the hallway after this, but I'll take like a quick question if anybody has one.

488
00:28:17,774 --> 00:28:19,115
Wow, everybody's leaving, I'm sorry.

489
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,595
All right, yes, it's true, very, very true.

490
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:26,355
Well, thank you so much, you guys.

491
00:28:26,435 --> 00:28:28,637
Again, I'll be in the hallway if you guys want to chat with me.

492
00:28:28,977 --> 00:28:30,277
And have a good GDC.
