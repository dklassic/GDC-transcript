00:00:04,439 --> 00:00:05,140
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,963
Welcome to my talk, Asking the Hard Questions, Morality

3
00:00:09,003 --> 00:00:09,684
Narrative Design.

4
00:00:09,904 --> 00:00:11,785
Have you guys all had your badge scanned?

5
00:00:12,826 --> 00:00:13,387
Yes, good.

6
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:15,408
That makes the life of the purple people a lot easier.

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:16,429
So.

8
00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:18,914
My name is Jana Stadler.

9
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:22,035
I currently study game design and production

10
00:00:22,315 --> 00:00:25,596
at the NHDB Breda, University of Applied Sciences

11
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:26,216
in the Netherlands.

12
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,977
I've got a lot of opinions on a lot of things,

13
00:00:29,217 --> 00:00:30,777
and especially on narrative design

14
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:32,918
and the way we use games to tell stories.

15
00:00:33,538 --> 00:00:35,899
So that's what we're going to be talking about

16
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:36,779
for the next 20 minutes.

17
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:41,940
But wait, I just mentioned a really bad word.

18
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,021
I'm a student.

19
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:46,522
So why should any of you listen to what I have to say?

20
00:00:47,504 --> 00:00:50,026
Well, for one, we all start somewhere.

21
00:00:50,546 --> 00:00:52,948
And the other thing is that being a student sometimes

22
00:00:53,648 --> 00:00:55,109
has its perks when it comes to games.

23
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:57,431
And the big thing is that students pretty much

24
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:58,672
run on passion alone.

25
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:02,474
Because we don't get paid, and we have really unhealthy diets,

26
00:01:02,514 --> 00:01:04,155
and all that energy needs to go somewhere.

27
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:07,357
And the great thing about that is that, as a student,

28
00:01:07,498 --> 00:01:08,999
I can fail safely.

29
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,121
My ability to pay my bills at the end of the month

30
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:14,963
does not depend on the success of what I'm currently making.

31
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,984
So that means that I get to try a lot of things that,

32
00:01:18,184 --> 00:01:20,745
as an actual developer, would cost me and other people

33
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:21,405
a lot of money.

34
00:01:23,846 --> 00:01:25,926
So these are three games that I've

35
00:01:25,966 --> 00:01:28,107
made in the last three years.

36
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:30,128
And I picked these three projects specifically

37
00:01:30,148 --> 00:01:31,748
because each of them taught me something

38
00:01:31,788 --> 00:01:35,989
about narrative design and the way we ask questions,

39
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:38,350
even if not all of them qualify for what

40
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,411
we would describe as kind of a story-driven game.

41
00:01:41,928 --> 00:01:44,089
So let's talk about the things that I've learned,

42
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:44,730
three of them.

43
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,813
The first is, branching isn't all that great.

44
00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:51,739
So this game's called Sanborn.

45
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,600
I worked on that with just about 20 people for 14 working days.

46
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,281
It's currently still in development,

47
00:01:58,301 --> 00:02:00,361
so I can't tell you all that much about it.

48
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:03,261
But the important details are I was a narrative lead

49
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:05,402
with one more dedicated writer on it,

50
00:02:05,422 --> 00:02:07,822
and then about, depending on the time of production,

51
00:02:07,902 --> 00:02:09,763
four or five other people making assets for it.

52
00:02:10,323 --> 00:02:11,303
It's a sci-fi game.

53
00:02:12,063 --> 00:02:13,103
It's an exploration game.

54
00:02:13,263 --> 00:02:15,344
And although we only asked one question to a player,

55
00:02:15,384 --> 00:02:17,924
we had over a dozen different endings.

56
00:02:19,523 --> 00:02:22,605
So basically what happens in Sunborn is that we have,

57
00:02:23,145 --> 00:02:24,165
no wait, that's the wrong slide.

58
00:02:24,865 --> 00:02:26,946
So basically what happens in Sunborn is that we have

59
00:02:27,406 --> 00:02:29,387
a spaceship crashing into the sun.

60
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:32,088
There's six people on board, three already dead,

61
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:33,028
you can save two.

62
00:02:33,728 --> 00:02:35,969
And it's up to the player if he wants to save any of them.

63
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:37,930
So that's how we end up with that configuration

64
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,630
of multiple endings.

65
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:46,117
And the problem with working on a game that branches this hard on a single question is that it can be really unrewarding.

66
00:02:46,758 --> 00:02:52,182
One, it can be unrewarding to the players because they kind of feel cheated that there's so many options but they only get to pick one.

67
00:02:53,442 --> 00:02:57,926
And it also can be really unrewarding for the people playing, for the people working on it.

68
00:02:57,946 --> 00:02:59,066
Because remember, we're students.

69
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:00,367
We're not getting paid.

70
00:03:00,967 --> 00:03:03,008
I had a team running on passion alone,

71
00:03:03,388 --> 00:03:06,929
and it can be really, really frustrating to work on something

72
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:08,469
knowing that it's going to be optional.

73
00:03:08,589 --> 00:03:10,390
Students don't like to do optional work.

74
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,251
So I had to constantly walk up to people and say,

75
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:15,792
like, hey, so this thing is not on the critical path,

76
00:03:15,832 --> 00:03:18,493
but can you please make it super nice for the one person who's

77
00:03:18,513 --> 00:03:19,153
going to see it?

78
00:03:19,956 --> 00:03:22,899
And the other thing with branching is that it can be really hard to get right,

79
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:26,824
because all options need to feel appealing for there to be a choice at all.

80
00:03:27,444 --> 00:03:33,911
So, with over a dozen different endings, I had to make sure that each of them feels desirable,

81
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:37,996
or in our case, undesirable, because we wanted our player to feel like they picked the wrong one no matter what.

82
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,451
And this really occurs in any situation

83
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:43,752
where you have a branching storyline.

84
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:45,312
This is a twine game I'm working on,

85
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:48,734
and it's pretty tame compared to what I've seen other people do

86
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:49,414
with that tool.

87
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:51,615
And still, it can be really frustrating to work on,

88
00:03:51,635 --> 00:03:52,575
because they know that everything

89
00:03:52,595 --> 00:03:55,416
in the lower half of this picture is optional.

90
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,437
I think a player needs to complete

91
00:03:57,477 --> 00:04:01,318
about five of those boxes, and I need to write all 20 or 30

92
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:02,319
that there is.

93
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:04,800
And I need to motivate myself to do that somehow.

94
00:04:06,106 --> 00:04:07,587
So the other thing that I found out

95
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,829
is that working with context and narrative

96
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,890
isn't all that great either.

97
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:15,293
So this is Human Parade, and I made that

98
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:17,514
with three other designers and one artist

99
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:19,796
during this year's Global Game Jam, so in 48 hours.

100
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:22,858
And it's a puzzle game powered by Arduinos, which basically

101
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:24,880
allowed us to make buttons out of anything,

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,461
as long as we wrapped tinfoil around it.

103
00:04:27,342 --> 00:04:29,824
But we only ever played in a very supervised kind

104
00:04:29,844 --> 00:04:30,884
of arcade-y setup.

105
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,541
So what happens in Human Parade is

106
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:36,722
that a player is given basically 10 actions, like laugh,

107
00:04:37,142 --> 00:04:39,223
or complain, or take a selfie.

108
00:04:39,784 --> 00:04:41,704
And they're mapped to one of these weird devices

109
00:04:41,724 --> 00:04:42,805
there on the table.

110
00:04:43,165 --> 00:04:45,726
And then they're getting put into quick situations,

111
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:47,347
like here on the screen we have compliment the man.

112
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,467
And you have 10 seconds to find the right action

113
00:04:49,828 --> 00:04:51,348
and use the right button to do that.

114
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:55,110
So granted, this game usually takes a lot of explanation

115
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,250
when people first see it.

116
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:57,211
They see the table.

117
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:57,991
They see the screen.

118
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:00,512
They don't know what the connection between the two is.

119
00:05:01,232 --> 00:05:03,133
And that can be really, really frustrating

120
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:05,353
if you have that in a narrative-driven game.

121
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,754
Because we, when we play Human Parade,

122
00:05:07,794 --> 00:05:10,835
we have the luxury to stand next to our players in the room

123
00:05:10,915 --> 00:05:12,556
every time we set that up.

124
00:05:13,116 --> 00:05:14,616
That's a luxury you usually don't have

125
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:16,117
in regular game development.

126
00:05:16,197 --> 00:05:17,777
You cannot sit next to your player and say,

127
00:05:17,997 --> 00:05:20,098
no, this is what that line meant.

128
00:05:20,138 --> 00:05:21,218
No, this is what you should do.

129
00:05:21,878 --> 00:05:23,959
And players need to understand their actions.

130
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,100
But close supervision isn't possible.

131
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,361
If we do supervise our players too closely,

132
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:32,361
and I've had that happen to me with Human Parade,

133
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:35,482
we tell them what to do, we don't show them what to do.

134
00:05:35,822 --> 00:05:37,783
And that's pretty much the biggest sin

135
00:05:37,823 --> 00:05:39,523
you can commit in any story.

136
00:05:40,284 --> 00:05:42,304
And player choice cannot happen in a vacuum.

137
00:05:42,444 --> 00:05:45,225
There's always some context to fill that void

138
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:47,686
if we want our story or our interaction in the game

139
00:05:47,706 --> 00:05:48,506
to make any sense.

140
00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:53,291
And then the third thing I learned is that people aren't all that great.

141
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:54,852
You can't trust players.

142
00:05:54,892 --> 00:05:55,592
You don't know them.

143
00:05:56,552 --> 00:05:59,634
So a year before Human Parade, we made The Letter Key of Solomon.

144
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:05,237
This was me and four other designers, and it's a horror-themed board game played solely

145
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:06,078
by candlelight.

146
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,542
So what happens is you're playing five teenagers who summon the demon,

147
00:06:10,682 --> 00:06:12,223
and depending on the role you're dealt,

148
00:06:12,263 --> 00:06:15,825
your objective revolves around either killing or protecting other players.

149
00:06:16,545 --> 00:06:19,567
And the mechanics are pretty simple because it all relies on the candlelight.

150
00:06:19,607 --> 00:06:22,368
There's a demon on the board. If you stand in the shadow, you're dead.

151
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:24,890
And then depending on what your role is, that might be good,

152
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,911
or that might be a bad thing.

153
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:27,952
And what I've noticed with this game

154
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:30,594
is that whenever we play it with friends,

155
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:33,836
it gets much, much more tense than when it's

156
00:06:33,856 --> 00:06:35,157
played in a group of strangers.

157
00:06:35,558 --> 00:06:38,480
We had one playtest group where a guy was really happy

158
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,102
that he died because that meant he couldn't reach his goal

159
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:41,582
anymore.

160
00:06:41,962 --> 00:06:43,944
His goal was to protect everyone on the table.

161
00:06:44,544 --> 00:06:46,986
But when he died, he was like, well, I can't win anymore

162
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:48,707
either, so I can just do whatever I want now,

163
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:51,529
and went on a headhunt to start killing all the other players.

164
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,111
And he didn't care that he couldn't win anymore.

165
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,193
It was way more fun for him to do that,

166
00:06:56,273 --> 00:06:57,974
because it forced him to interact much more.

167
00:06:59,835 --> 00:07:04,038
So these three lessons are pretty much what I've learned.

168
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:07,501
And I don't know.

169
00:07:07,781 --> 00:07:09,823
Do they really tell us what to do with games?

170
00:07:10,003 --> 00:07:11,184
Branching isn't all that great.

171
00:07:11,284 --> 00:07:12,605
Context isn't all that great.

172
00:07:12,725 --> 00:07:13,946
People aren't all that great.

173
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,628
Does that mean we can't tell any stories at all?

174
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:18,209
Because those are pretty much the pillars

175
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,610
that we usually build stories on.

176
00:07:20,371 --> 00:07:20,631
Well.

177
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:25,376
I think each of them is actually a strength if we look at them

178
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:26,256
a bit more closer.

179
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:29,158
So let's start with branching and why

180
00:07:29,178 --> 00:07:29,958
it isn't all that great.

181
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:31,959
Or as I like to call branching, player choice.

182
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,580
Do as I make you wish.

183
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:38,863
Because a lot of contemporary games rely on having a story

184
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:40,584
and having an impact on the choices

185
00:07:40,624 --> 00:07:42,885
that player makes as a main interaction.

186
00:07:43,446 --> 00:07:44,806
We kind of tell players they can do whatever

187
00:07:44,846 --> 00:07:45,987
they want in these worlds, and that

188
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,529
is going to change the flow of the events and of the scenes.

189
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:52,180
when really, half of the time it doesn't.

190
00:07:53,121 --> 00:07:55,803
And the problem with it is that, although we

191
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:57,184
want our players to be in control,

192
00:07:57,204 --> 00:07:59,545
we as developers need character consistency.

193
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:02,647
Our characters last for really lengthy experience and times.

194
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:05,188
We have protagonists that go through four or five games

195
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:05,669
of 20 hours each.

196
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:08,837
in some of the more severe cases.

197
00:08:08,877 --> 00:08:11,259
And on the other hand, protagonists

198
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,682
also serve as a manifestation of the player within the world.

199
00:08:14,262 --> 00:08:18,226
So we can't completely control what that protagonist does

200
00:08:18,306 --> 00:08:20,088
if we want to allow our player to role play.

201
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:22,370
But we also can't leave it completely open,

202
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,091
because then they're just going to flip-flop

203
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:26,674
between two personalities and not feel like a character

204
00:08:26,754 --> 00:08:27,054
at all.

205
00:08:27,735 --> 00:08:31,642
So what we usually do as developers is really break down our protagonist into keywords,

206
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:38,915
into archetypes, to avoid that randomness and to avoid breaking our character halfway through a cutscene.

207
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:42,196
So as a developer, you would find those kind of archetypes

208
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:45,958
and those keywords you've settled upon in your GDD

209
00:08:46,038 --> 00:08:47,139
or in your character Bible.

210
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:49,321
And as a player, you usually find them in the stat screen,

211
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:51,482
where I can look down and say, OK,

212
00:08:51,882 --> 00:08:54,024
if I specced 10 points into strength,

213
00:08:54,644 --> 00:08:56,766
and I could lift that war axe before,

214
00:08:57,466 --> 00:09:00,148
then I assume that I can pick up the sword in this scene.

215
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:02,870
Or if I specced all my points into charisma,

216
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,051
I'm going to assume that people do what I want

217
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:06,532
them to do in the dialogue scenes.

218
00:09:07,253 --> 00:09:08,955
And my big problem with that is that once you

219
00:09:08,975 --> 00:09:11,677
start pushing these kind of binary qualities

220
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,501
into a dialogue system, you get that dreaded little good

221
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:17,684
versus evil bar that we have around Shepard's face

222
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:18,204
here right now.

223
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:18,264
So.

224
00:09:20,955 --> 00:09:24,016
My problem with good versus evil is not that it's a bad conflict.

225
00:09:24,617 --> 00:09:29,298
Good versus evil is a pretty good way to track what your protagonist is.

226
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,480
Usually what we do is assume that good is kind of a nice person who helps people,

227
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,802
and evil is someone who just does what they please and tries to burn down a few buildings on the way down.

228
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:43,764
The problem that I have with it is that we're trying to put a number on it.

229
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:48,006
Good versus evil as a conflict translates into a lot of settings,

230
00:09:48,407 --> 00:09:51,508
it can work in a lot of story genres, it can work with a lot of protagonists,

231
00:09:51,788 --> 00:09:53,789
but once we start trying to quantify it,

232
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:56,051
although it gives us something useful to work with in gameplay,

233
00:09:56,511 --> 00:10:00,173
it pretty much pushes our players to make really strange decisions.

234
00:10:00,593 --> 00:10:05,275
And quite honestly, the last time it worked was in Star Wars. Period.

235
00:10:06,424 --> 00:10:07,204
And here's why.

236
00:10:08,005 --> 00:10:10,346
Because Star Wars as a franchise is set up

237
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:13,808
with a very, very clear evil and a very, very clear good side,

238
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:15,848
and then a big gray spectrum between it.

239
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:17,689
And every character you ever meet

240
00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:20,371
in the movie franchise of Star Wars

241
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:22,451
places somewhere on that scale.

242
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:24,454
and can be described through their alignment.

243
00:10:24,474 --> 00:10:26,817
So we have characters like Palpatine, who are really, really bad.

244
00:10:27,217 --> 00:10:29,540
And then we have characters like Yoda, who are really, really good.

245
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,444
And arguably the most interesting are probably characters like Han Solo,

246
00:10:33,525 --> 00:10:35,667
who don't quite know where they fit yet,

247
00:10:35,767 --> 00:10:38,991
or characters like Darth Vader, where if you watch all six movies,

248
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:41,854
it's basically a story of him going from one end to the other and then going back.

249
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:48,966
And consequently we get these two games that basically break Star Wars in the most perfect way

250
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:51,987
by saying, okay, we're going to construct a story that plays only in the middle part

251
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:54,328
and we're not even going to look at the two extremes in the world.

252
00:10:54,368 --> 00:10:57,969
We're going to throw grey character after grey character after grey character after you

253
00:10:58,309 --> 00:10:59,809
and you have to figure out where they stand.

254
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:02,527
And the way that works in the game

255
00:11:02,587 --> 00:11:04,548
is that the protagonist pretty much gathers points

256
00:11:04,628 --> 00:11:07,069
for either being a Jedi or being a Sith through the dialogue

257
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:07,469
system.

258
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:10,470
So you pick a dialogue option that says, plus 5, good guy,

259
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,931
or plus 5, evil guy.

260
00:11:12,551 --> 00:11:15,352
And the combat mechanics are gated by these points.

261
00:11:15,952 --> 00:11:17,433
But what's really beautiful about it

262
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:18,674
is that Knights of the Old Republic

263
00:11:18,694 --> 00:11:23,155
was one of the last few games where being neutral

264
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:25,196
didn't mean you were weaker in combat.

265
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:32,479
If you look at sort of slightly newer games that have a similar mechanic where you gather points, you have a scale, and then it unlocks combat bonuses.

266
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:35,500
If you play neutral, you just don't get the bonus points.

267
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:41,281
Whereas in Knights of the Republic, the way it worked was that the morality actually guided the resource flow.

268
00:11:41,922 --> 00:11:45,584
So if you are very much leaning towards the Sith side,

269
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:48,406
that meant that using Sith powers was very cheap.

270
00:11:48,746 --> 00:11:51,008
Using Jedi powers was very expensive.

271
00:11:51,048 --> 00:11:52,088
Whereas if you were in the neutral,

272
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:53,990
both were about the same price.

273
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:57,572
So there was a gameplay reason to play neutral, not just

274
00:11:57,652 --> 00:11:58,613
a storytelling one.

275
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:00,474
In most games, what you will find

276
00:12:00,534 --> 00:12:02,315
is the only reason to play neutral

277
00:12:02,355 --> 00:12:04,256
is because at some point during the tutorial,

278
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:05,577
I said, yeah, I'm not going to pick a side.

279
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:06,458
I'm going to stay neutral.

280
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,719
And then after 20 hours, you notice

281
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,541
that you're weaker than if you'd picked one of them.

282
00:12:11,241 --> 00:12:14,931
And the other thing is that with Star Wars, the system is based on the story world.

283
00:12:15,372 --> 00:12:18,279
Everything in Star Wars abides to that rule.

284
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:19,242
Whereas...

285
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:21,642
In most games it doesn't.

286
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:26,285
And the other beautiful thing is that this is actually visualized.

287
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:29,027
Everything abides to that rule, so your companions

288
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:30,168
have the same scale as you.

289
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:32,590
If you flip through the character portraits in Mass Effect

290
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,052
or in Dragon Age, you're going to notice that in Dragon Age,

291
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:37,594
only the companions have them, because it's

292
00:12:37,634 --> 00:12:38,674
about how much they like you.

293
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:41,596
In Mass Effect, only the protagonist has them.

294
00:12:41,616 --> 00:12:43,138
Whereas in Knights of the Republic,

295
00:12:43,158 --> 00:12:45,099
the whole point was that everyone has a scale,

296
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:47,381
and if they like you, you can influence theirs.

297
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:50,584
But they were already placed in that alignment systems

298
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,685
before they ever met you.

299
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:53,987
So to me, that's the great pitfall

300
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:57,992
of games that these days try to ask the big questions,

301
00:12:58,552 --> 00:12:59,854
but then color code them for you.

302
00:12:59,874 --> 00:13:02,176
It's that there's never a reason to play neutral.

303
00:13:02,196 --> 00:13:03,858
There's never a reason to deviate

304
00:13:03,898 --> 00:13:06,380
from the beaten path you picked in the first five minutes.

305
00:13:06,921 --> 00:13:09,724
It really is more of a fashion and not a lifestyle choice.

306
00:13:11,512 --> 00:13:14,540
And that pretty much leads us into our next question also,

307
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,405
in context, why it isn't all that great.

308
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:18,010
So if I can't change the world, don't

309
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,153
make me pretend like I do.

310
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,373
Telltale does that a lot.

311
00:13:21,793 --> 00:13:23,934
Obviously, Telltale comes up in pretty much every talk

312
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:25,975
you do on morality and game design these days.

313
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:28,056
And the reason is that all of their games

314
00:13:28,097 --> 00:13:30,358
are marketed as something where you have to make hard choices.

315
00:13:30,398 --> 00:13:32,339
And because they reduce the gameplay so much

316
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,100
that there's only dialogue left.

317
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,761
And I think that's a very good way

318
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:39,102
to do it because it really breaks apart this idea of,

319
00:13:39,463 --> 00:13:42,284
I need to be strong, and I need to have a cool story.

320
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:44,645
And just says, no, no, you're strong, or you're weak.

321
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:45,626
We decide that for you.

322
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:46,646
You play the story.

323
00:13:47,467 --> 00:13:49,048
But still they have their issues.

324
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:51,951
I mean, my favorite among them is probably The Wolf Among Us,

325
00:13:52,211 --> 00:13:55,034
because it was the only one where just through the setup,

326
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:57,157
it didn't bother me that my choices didn't

327
00:13:57,197 --> 00:13:58,118
have any impact at all.

328
00:13:58,658 --> 00:14:00,880
Because The Wolf Among Us, by nature, it's a crime story.

329
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:02,362
You know how crime stories end.

330
00:14:02,422 --> 00:14:03,944
At the end, you find out who did it.

331
00:14:04,584 --> 00:14:07,026
And you can't find that out in the five minutes,

332
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:08,347
because otherwise there isn't a story.

333
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:09,908
And you also can't change who did it,

334
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:10,889
because he did it in the beginning.

335
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,571
So in that game, I wasn't really upset

336
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:16,974
that I knew I would hit the same key points

337
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:18,856
if I played it a completely different way,

338
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,858
because it was in the IP and it was in the franchise.

339
00:14:23,397 --> 00:14:27,122
And still, it fell into that hole of the feedback loop

340
00:14:27,422 --> 00:14:29,605
that I think hinders a lot of the great storytelling

341
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:30,226
that we could do.

342
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:32,890
Because Move Among Us, like many telltale games,

343
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,933
reminds you when you did something important.

344
00:14:35,752 --> 00:14:39,736
So it basically tells me whenever I set something,

345
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:41,417
that another character is going to remember

346
00:14:41,437 --> 00:14:42,758
and is going to reference later.

347
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,641
And by that, it takes the impact away from the next few lines

348
00:14:46,661 --> 00:14:47,062
that come.

349
00:14:47,082 --> 00:14:48,783
Because if I see that pop, I know, OK,

350
00:14:49,103 --> 00:14:50,084
I'm safe for two minutes now.

351
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:51,185
I can click whatever I want.

352
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:52,626
And it takes the stress out of it

353
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:56,009
by placing specific value on specific dialogue lines.

354
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:58,151
And I think that's really sad in a game that

355
00:14:58,351 --> 00:15:00,132
did try to make me stress by giving me

356
00:15:00,172 --> 00:15:01,453
a timer to pick my lines.

357
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:04,874
So a game that did it way better, in my opinion,

358
00:15:05,134 --> 00:15:06,095
is the Banner Saga.

359
00:15:06,596 --> 00:15:07,997
Because in the Banner Saga, you usually

360
00:15:08,017 --> 00:15:09,699
get really little feedback on what you do.

361
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,921
We're used to giving feedback to our players.

362
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:16,446
In contemporary games, every button press,

363
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:18,649
we have to be like, yes, we noticed you pressed that button.

364
00:15:19,029 --> 00:15:20,431
Everything you do, yes, we noticed.

365
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:21,552
You did something.

366
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:22,493
Here's an animation for it.

367
00:15:23,774 --> 00:15:31,438
Whereas in traditional storytelling media, we pretty much accept as an audience that we don't always get the answer to a question right away.

368
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:38,602
If I read a book, and I read two pages about a character picking which way to take as a crossroad,

369
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:44,325
I'm not expecting to find out on the next page whether that path he picked was wrong or right.

370
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:49,948
I'm expecting that to be revealed in three chapters down the line, or perhaps in the next book if I'm unlucky.

371
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,330
We pretty much try and always tell our players right away

372
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,891
what they did, what's going to happen,

373
00:15:57,151 --> 00:15:58,211
and why this is good or bad.

374
00:15:58,251 --> 00:15:59,712
We try to reward them right away,

375
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,253
and that's not really how choices work in real life.

376
00:16:02,973 --> 00:16:05,254
If we try to make hard choices, they're

377
00:16:05,274 --> 00:16:07,234
hard because we don't know what will happen next.

378
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,955
And in games, usually we have all the cards laid out for us.

379
00:16:11,268 --> 00:16:16,929
So Banner Saga kind of drops you into this really bleak fantasy world where there isn't much hope left,

380
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:19,250
but it's a new IP, it's a new franchise.

381
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,090
It's not Walking Dead where you're just like,

382
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,251
well, it's Walking Dead, I know it's going to go horribly wrong,

383
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:24,831
and I know how and I know why.

384
00:16:25,411 --> 00:16:27,972
Because I've seen this franchise outside of a Telltale game.

385
00:16:28,012 --> 00:16:31,032
I've seen it in comics, I've seen it in the TV show,

386
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:32,513
I've seen it in marketing material.

387
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,993
I think with fresh IPs in the time of...

388
00:16:36,158 --> 00:16:39,019
well, sequel fetishism of this industry,

389
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:40,639
we can try a few things because our players

390
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,560
don't quite know what to expect next.

391
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,481
And Banner of Sargeras does that all the time.

392
00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:46,781
I mean, I had moments in this game

393
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:49,822
where I was stressed about every choice coming up,

394
00:16:49,862 --> 00:16:51,683
and they come up about every five seconds,

395
00:16:52,023 --> 00:16:54,344
because I had no clue which minor conflict

396
00:16:54,364 --> 00:16:55,724
would go into a major one,

397
00:16:55,744 --> 00:16:57,345
and which choice would come back later,

398
00:16:57,665 --> 00:16:58,445
because someone figured out

399
00:16:58,485 --> 00:16:59,986
they didn't actually like what I did there.

400
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:02,326
There's no right or wrong way.

401
00:17:03,027 --> 00:17:05,490
to play a telltale game or to play these kinds of games.

402
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,414
There's no right or wrong way to play a game like Papers, Please.

403
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:11,458
No matter what you do, there's always going to be someone disappointed.

404
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,042
You can try and be the good guy and not please everyone,

405
00:17:14,462 --> 00:17:17,466
or you can try and be the evil guy and then not be respected by everyone,

406
00:17:17,887 --> 00:17:19,989
but one way or another, you'll always wonder.

407
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,036
And I think the way these games achieve that is by putting

408
00:17:24,116 --> 00:17:27,320
the emphasis on the moment and not revealing the bigger

409
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,662
picture right away or not alluding to it constantly.

410
00:17:30,183 --> 00:17:32,365
They try and venture off the beating path by not

411
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:34,488
rewarding being extreme.

412
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:37,051
In fact, Banner Saga or Delta games,

413
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:39,453
they don't even reward you picking a dialogue option.

414
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:42,276
They don't give you like plus five, plus here, minus there.

415
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:43,698
It's just there.

416
00:17:44,118 --> 00:17:46,820
You take the dialogue option because that's what you do.

417
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,903
There's no big reward in a player pressing a button.

418
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,485
They have to find out if there's going to be one along the way.

419
00:17:54,305 --> 00:17:57,448
And I think if we strengthen the context of the choices

420
00:17:57,488 --> 00:17:58,849
we ask our players to make, we can

421
00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:01,391
enforce that kind of ambiguity in the questions

422
00:18:01,431 --> 00:18:02,271
we ask a lot more.

423
00:18:04,173 --> 00:18:06,614
But still, players are people.

424
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:10,837
And players, as people, aren't great at all.

425
00:18:11,697 --> 00:18:16,982
So if we look at modern media, I think one problem we have

426
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:20,345
is that there is an inflation of physical violence.

427
00:18:20,945 --> 00:18:22,326
You look at a show of Game of Thrones

428
00:18:22,386 --> 00:18:24,348
and there's a beheading in the first five minutes.

429
00:18:24,848 --> 00:18:26,189
So that sets the bar.

430
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:32,194
That tells me what inconvenience or tragedy in this kind of world

431
00:18:32,234 --> 00:18:33,175
is going to be like.

432
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:36,398
And that's the bar I need to hit every time now that I

433
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:37,479
want to have attention peak.

434
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,310
So in games we do that naturally as well, especially in RPGs.

435
00:18:41,351 --> 00:18:44,033
If a combat system is the main part of gameplay that's fun,

436
00:18:44,093 --> 00:18:45,974
then yeah, you're probably going to do

437
00:18:46,014 --> 00:18:47,255
some killing in the tutorial.

438
00:18:47,976 --> 00:18:50,698
And the problem with that is that we run into a situation

439
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:53,681
where every tension peak we do is either a character being

440
00:18:53,761 --> 00:18:55,742
saved or a character being killed.

441
00:18:56,683 --> 00:19:01,866
And I'm guilty of that as well. I just told you, I wrote a game that is all about picking who lives or dies.

442
00:19:02,607 --> 00:19:06,529
But in my case, it was going to be a short game and it wasn't going to have a sequel.

443
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:11,792
If we open the first five minutes of a game and you're already picking these things,

444
00:19:12,113 --> 00:19:15,595
I'm expecting to be doing that for the next 30 hours of this game,

445
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:18,637
and for the next three games that come into this franchise.

446
00:19:21,885 --> 00:19:24,846
And in my opinion, there's a pretty easy way around that,

447
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:27,988
which is pitting people against actual people.

448
00:19:28,008 --> 00:19:30,989
I think way too often in games, we

449
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:34,931
don't consider that multiplayer games can enable stories too.

450
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:39,113
Competition or cooperation with another human being

451
00:19:39,273 --> 00:19:40,774
has a completely different impact

452
00:19:40,814 --> 00:19:44,056
than cooperation or competition with an NPC.

453
00:19:44,761 --> 00:19:47,405
Like I said earlier, if I spec all my points into Charisma,

454
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,888
I'm expecting that NPCs do what I want.

455
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,831
But if I'm playing with actual people,

456
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,994
well, you've probably all had a situation

457
00:19:54,014 --> 00:19:56,277
where you really wanted that player to play that one card

458
00:19:56,357 --> 00:19:57,238
and they didn't because.

459
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,291
Perhaps they were your little brother

460
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:01,532
and they were trying to get you to lose the game.

461
00:20:02,252 --> 00:20:07,594
So real players raise the stakes without raising

462
00:20:07,614 --> 00:20:09,474
the tension that you need in the story.

463
00:20:09,534 --> 00:20:11,395
Because suddenly you have pranks, you have bluffs.

464
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:13,656
You have the joy of doing something nice just

465
00:20:13,676 --> 00:20:14,376
for the sake of it.

466
00:20:14,936 --> 00:20:16,777
If I do something good to an NPC in a game,

467
00:20:16,937 --> 00:20:17,997
I'm probably going to get a reward.

468
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:20,638
I'm going to get money, or I'm going to get an item,

469
00:20:20,998 --> 00:20:22,199
or I'm going to get a cute cut scene.

470
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:25,940
If you've ever tried to be the helpful support in this game,

471
00:20:26,668 --> 00:20:30,970
you probably won't get rewarded because you're playing with actual people and they don't really care.

472
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,832
And still, while I was writing this talk, I was trying to think about

473
00:20:35,852 --> 00:20:39,033
the nicest thing someone had ever done to me in a game.

474
00:20:39,914 --> 00:20:43,155
And it was a match of League of Legends that we had lost.

475
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:44,616
We knew we were losing it.

476
00:20:46,097 --> 00:20:51,039
And another player kept refusing to surrender just because he wanted to play two or three more minutes with me.

477
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:54,542
To me that was way nicer than anything I'd ever seen in a cutscene.

478
00:20:55,243 --> 00:21:01,670
And I've never felt so guilty about leaving someone to die in a single player game either.

479
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:07,341
If I leave someone to die in Mass Effect, I know they're going to be gone for the next 10 years of this franchise running.

480
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:10,522
If I leave someone to die in League of Legends, they're gone for 50 seconds.

481
00:21:11,202 --> 00:21:13,183
But they can complain about it in the chat box.

482
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,524
And I know that's an actual human being missing out on 60 seconds of playing a game.

483
00:21:18,245 --> 00:21:22,086
And I think that's the big issue with us pushing character death into all of our big choices.

484
00:21:23,006 --> 00:21:33,914
Is there really a point in me ever choosing the evil option if I know that keeping this character alive might, perhaps, at some point, lead to a funny line in a sequel or in a DLC or in a later quest?

485
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:42,161
Is there any point in playing evil when the only way for me to play evil is to completely depopulize the playing field?

486
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,267
And I think it's OK to sometimes tell our players that they

487
00:21:46,307 --> 00:21:48,069
have to be the good guy, and that they

488
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:49,811
have to be cooperative, and that they

489
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:50,912
can't hurt the other player.

490
00:21:51,713 --> 00:21:53,855
And I also think it's OK to sometimes tell our players

491
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:55,477
that they can't be cooperative, that they

492
00:21:55,517 --> 00:21:58,059
have to be the competitor, that they have to be the rival.

493
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,243
I don't need to give a player a gun to find an enemy.

494
00:22:01,263 --> 00:22:02,704
A ball is enough.

495
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:07,428
And if we go for those more subtle themes, if we try and look outside of the box of,

496
00:22:07,948 --> 00:22:10,831
well, Darth Vader's evil because he blew up Alderaan,

497
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,434
then I think we can find a lot more themes to explore and to play with

498
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,575
and to make our choices more ambiguous than,

499
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:19,197
do you kill character A or do you kill character B?

500
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,533
If you present me with that choice,

501
00:22:21,593 --> 00:22:23,174
and then the next one is, well, do you

502
00:22:23,194 --> 00:22:25,435
give your lactose intolerant friend

503
00:22:25,495 --> 00:22:27,676
the sandwich with the cheese or the sausage,

504
00:22:28,036 --> 00:22:29,017
I won't think about it much.

505
00:22:29,037 --> 00:22:30,857
Because I just killed someone 10 seconds ago.

506
00:22:30,918 --> 00:22:32,818
I don't care if he eats a sandwich he can't eat.

507
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:35,240
But if that entire game never had a killing scene

508
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,281
to begin with, if we play with the smaller tragedies in life,

509
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:40,702
then I think we can find a lot of themes

510
00:22:40,742 --> 00:22:42,083
that haven't been explored in games,

511
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:44,124
and then that can enable us to do things

512
00:22:44,724 --> 00:22:45,565
that haven't been done.

513
00:22:46,785 --> 00:22:47,846
So what lessons have we learned?

514
00:22:49,107 --> 00:22:52,329
Well, let's try to re-evaluate the way our stories branch.

515
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:54,271
Because sometimes it's OK to admit

516
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,432
that this is a fashion, not a lifestyle choice

517
00:22:56,452 --> 00:22:57,173
you're making here.

518
00:22:57,633 --> 00:23:01,216
Sometimes it's OK to do a game like the Telltale stories,

519
00:23:01,476 --> 00:23:03,618
where we know from the beginning that we won't change

520
00:23:03,698 --> 00:23:06,240
any of the bigger outcomes, but we'll

521
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,742
make the experience our own through the dialogue options

522
00:23:08,782 --> 00:23:09,182
we're given.

523
00:23:10,003 --> 00:23:12,184
And let's try and consider a player who

524
00:23:12,204 --> 00:23:13,764
flips between the extremes.

525
00:23:14,205 --> 00:23:17,326
Let's try and consider a player who doesn't want to always pick

526
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:18,166
the blue option.

527
00:23:18,586 --> 00:23:20,607
Let's try to consider a player who actually

528
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:23,168
wants to think about it and who lends to the neutral part.

529
00:23:23,208 --> 00:23:26,090
Let's try to give them something that advances the game as well.

530
00:23:27,963 --> 00:23:30,906
And let's try to reevaluate the themes that we work with.

531
00:23:31,606 --> 00:23:35,068
Understand your world first, and then construct a story with it.

532
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,670
There's certain story worlds, there's certain franchises

533
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,492
that work with really drastic themes.

534
00:23:39,572 --> 00:23:40,552
Others need subtlety.

535
00:23:40,872 --> 00:23:42,714
There's certain genres where you can get away with things

536
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,675
that you get punished for if you're

537
00:23:44,695 --> 00:23:45,736
working in a different genre.

538
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:49,518
And please just stop overusing physical violence.

539
00:23:50,219 --> 00:23:53,301
You hit diminishing returns on the impact and meaning

540
00:23:53,661 --> 00:23:54,702
of your tension peaks.

541
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:00,849
And I think that's an issue when we're trying to tell stories that last longer than the 90 minutes of a summer blockbuster.

542
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:04,290
And re-evaluate the single-player status quo.

543
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,031
I firmly believe that multiplayer genres offer

544
00:24:07,091 --> 00:24:09,332
numerous ways of doing really dodgy things to people.

545
00:24:09,872 --> 00:24:11,853
Just try thinking about stealing a car in DayZ

546
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:15,195
versus stealing a car in GTA and having a player hunt you

547
00:24:15,215 --> 00:24:16,915
down for 30 minutes trying to get it back.

548
00:24:17,576 --> 00:24:20,637
So I think modern settings, like the dystopia we see in movies

549
00:24:20,737 --> 00:24:23,338
or the survival genre that emerged with games like DayZ

550
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,379
like Unbound, can bring out the worst in people and the best.

551
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,162
And those are the memorable moments that we're looking for.

552
00:24:29,863 --> 00:24:32,426
Those are the stories we're trying to enable people to tell.

553
00:24:32,446 --> 00:24:35,149
So thank you for your time and your attention.

554
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:39,814
I think I took too long, and we don't have time for questions.

555
00:24:39,974 --> 00:24:41,096
Or can we take one or two?

556
00:24:59,115 --> 00:25:00,096
I should ask him later.

557
00:25:00,116 --> 00:25:07,744
Okay, you mentioned Dragon Age and everything with the morality bar.

558
00:25:07,804 --> 00:25:09,866
No, there's a friendship bar.

559
00:25:10,306 --> 00:25:10,527
Yes.

560
00:25:10,707 --> 00:25:15,792
And I remember playing Dragon Age 2.

561
00:25:15,832 --> 00:25:19,236
I had some where I was friends with, others I was rivals with.

562
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:24,428
And some there I was neutral with, but I had a relationship with them.

563
00:25:24,508 --> 00:25:30,129
I had a whole thing with them, but I was neutral because sometimes it was good, sometimes it was bad.

564
00:25:31,209 --> 00:25:34,010
But developing for that, how would you do that?

565
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:42,691
Because it would be a third story with that character, so it would be extra budget going into it.

566
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:47,312
Okay, so the question is how do you develop for that third option?

567
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:53,237
well, you just said it, be aware that if you give me three

568
00:25:53,297 --> 00:25:55,178
choices, you need to develop three choices

569
00:25:55,218 --> 00:25:56,179
within your budget.

570
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,920
I think the trick is trying to step away

571
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,442
from a clearly binary system always

572
00:26:01,742 --> 00:26:03,784
and trying to think about, how can I

573
00:26:03,804 --> 00:26:05,485
do something that's in the middle of these things?

574
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,986
but is it, that still feels appealing.

575
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,747
I think 80 Days did a really good job at it

576
00:26:09,807 --> 00:26:12,648
by not tracking two stats, but four, pretty much.

577
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:14,489
They didn't say you are good or evil,

578
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:16,450
they said, I think it was patient and impatient

579
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,850
and then polite and impolite.

580
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,751
So you basically had,

581
00:26:20,591 --> 00:26:22,552
you had a slightly more complex system in that,

582
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:25,213
and that meant that it opened up the room for them

583
00:26:25,273 --> 00:26:28,135
to do more interesting interactions

584
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:30,716
without necessarily blowing their budget

585
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:31,496
just by branching more.

586
00:26:31,516 --> 00:26:35,578
Thank you.

587
00:26:40,062 --> 00:26:42,040
Otherwise, I'm very sorry for holding you in that room too long.
