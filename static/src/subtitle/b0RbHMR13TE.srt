1
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:03,628
You

2
00:00:38,023 --> 00:00:41,285
We are pleased to begin the second half of our evening

3
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:45,306
and welcome you to the 22nd Annual Game Developers' Choice

4
00:00:45,306 --> 00:00:45,927
Awards.

5
00:00:45,927 --> 00:00:50,608
Please welcome the host of the evening, Osama Dorias.

6
00:00:50,608 --> 00:01:07,375
Thank you.

7
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:07,795
Knock, knock.

8
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,041
Halo.

9
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:14,221
Halo!

10
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:14,661
Halo, everyone!

11
00:01:14,661 --> 00:01:22,766
My name is Osama Dorias, and I am so honored to be your host for the 22nd Annual Game Developers

12
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:23,547
Choice Awards.

13
00:01:23,547 --> 00:01:36,095
I've learned to always start with my best joke.

14
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:39,177
It helps set the tone and manage expectations.

15
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:46,254
The Game Developers Choice Awards have always held a special place in my heart,

16
00:01:46,254 --> 00:01:51,198
because these are our picks for the best in our industry.

17
00:01:51,198 --> 00:02:05,570
My friends, it feels great to return to an in-person ceremony.

18
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,452
Now, world circumstances being what they are,

19
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:13,592
This event will look and feel a bit different from what we're used to.

20
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:17,832
But don't worry, we have lots of safety protocols in place.

21
00:02:17,832 --> 00:02:33,655
Everyone's vaccinated, we've got masks, we're working on getting everyone unionized.

22
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:36,596
And I promise there are no NFTs tonight.

23
00:02:46,155 --> 00:02:56,764
All of our awards are all completely fungible.

24
00:02:56,764 --> 00:03:01,328
That was an interesting choice.

25
00:03:01,328 --> 00:03:05,291
I think it's okay if things are a little different.

26
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,994
I mean, what are game developers, if not adaptive and resilient?

27
00:03:08,994 --> 00:03:11,717
2021 was a wild roller coaster of a year.

28
00:03:11,717 --> 00:03:15,280
But despite everything, so many amazing games came out.

29
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:21,753
And everyone in this room knows that releasing a game at all is a miracle.

30
00:03:21,753 --> 00:03:29,657
In light of this, I don't think it's fair that we can't give everyone an award.

31
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:34,559
So I made an award for everyone who released a game this year.

32
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:45,625
Isn't it beautiful?

33
00:03:47,304 --> 00:03:56,411
This trophy is all of ours.

34
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:58,372
But we're going to keep it at my house, okay?

35
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:02,755
Is that okay?

36
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:03,496
Whoa, it's heavy.

37
00:04:03,496 --> 00:04:06,698
But really, let's get on with the show.

38
00:04:06,698 --> 00:04:12,602
I have a personal goal to make as many dad jokes and puns as possible tonight.

39
00:04:14,347 --> 00:04:25,674
So let's start with unpacking these awards.

40
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:29,036
We start our show with the award for the best debut.

41
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:34,059
An award for studios starting out their legacy on the right foot.

42
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:42,224
From the artful escape to Wildermyth, each of these games showcases the bright future of game development.

43
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,873
and I can't wait to see what these studios come up with next.

44
00:04:46,873 --> 00:04:52,418
Every first game has a special place in our hearts,

45
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:54,319
but it's incredible to see a studio

46
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,621
knock it out of the park on their first try.

47
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:58,122
Usually, it takes two.

48
00:04:58,122 --> 00:04:58,362
Okay?

49
00:04:58,362 --> 00:04:58,563
Okay?

50
00:04:58,563 --> 00:04:59,643
Okay?

51
00:04:59,643 --> 00:04:59,844
Okay?

52
00:04:59,844 --> 00:05:00,124
Okay?

53
00:05:00,124 --> 00:05:00,224
Okay?

54
00:05:00,224 --> 00:05:00,704
Okay?

55
00:05:00,704 --> 00:05:09,211
Okay?

56
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:09,612
Okay?

57
00:05:09,612 --> 00:05:10,292
Okay?

58
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:11,893
So here are the nominees for the best debut.

59
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:18,524

And the winner is...

00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,942
Iron Gate Studios.

69
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:59,704
The best debut winner couldn't be here tonight, but they've sent an acceptance message.

70
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:00,544
Hi, I'm Josephine.

71
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:01,084
I'm Robin.

72
00:07:01,084 --> 00:07:02,365
And I'm Lisa, and we're from Iron Gate.

73
00:07:02,365 --> 00:07:06,407
Thank you so much for aiming well on this year's best debut. It really is an honor.

74
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:11,429
It's been a great time working on this game, and we're happy to hear that you appreciate the game so much.

75
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:14,330
Thank you so much for everything.

76
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,611
Bob, hey, peace out!

77
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:32,347
So, what's a video game's artist's favorite soda?

78
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:32,467
Sprite!

79
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:38,330
Thank you, Tim.

80
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,332
Thank you.

81
00:07:41,332 --> 00:07:43,453
Someone liked it.

82
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:44,854
OK, that was a bad one.

83
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:45,094
I'm sorry.

84
00:07:46,021 --> 00:07:51,104
Video game art can range from 8-bit pixels to photorealistic worlds,

85
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:54,166
complete with puzzles, with reflections.

86
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,467
It's breathtaking.

87
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:59,130
And above all, it's interactive.

88
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:04,833
You can't step into a movie and see the grass move when you swing your sword,

89
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,455
or open a glowing chest and get what's inside.

90
00:08:07,455 --> 00:08:12,458
These games are exemplary for having some of the best art

91
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,220
that our medium has to offer.

92
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:17,374
Here are the nominees for the Best Visual Art.

93
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:18,175

00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:35,959
published by Xbox Game Studios,

108
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:38,240
is set in Teesboro, Montgomery.

109
00:09:42,263 --> 00:09:46,452
And the winner is...

110
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:49,218
I'll get it open.

111
00:09:49,218 --> 00:09:50,020
Ratchet and Clank.

112
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:32,360
Uh, thank you. This is crazy. Uh, so thank you GDC. Uh, thank you for, uh, the other nominees. All those games were just beautiful and amazing and we're in great company.

113
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,444
Uh, Grant Hollis, our amazing art director. Marcus Smith, creative director. Mike Daly.

114
00:10:37,444 --> 00:10:41,827
Uh, the entire awesome and amazing Insomniac art and tech teams.

115
00:10:41,827 --> 00:10:47,952
Uh, all of our supportive families and all the fans that love these characters as much as we do.

116
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:50,273
This was a dream project.

117
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:52,414
It's why I wanted to work in Insomniac,

118
00:10:52,414 --> 00:10:54,356
and it's kind of amazing to be up here.

119
00:10:54,356 --> 00:10:54,836
So, thank you.

120
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:55,297
Thank you.

121
00:10:55,297 --> 00:11:16,214
Has anyone heard anything about the best audio award?

122
00:11:19,057 --> 00:11:22,019
No? I guess we'll have to play it by ear?

123
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:22,059
No!

124
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:28,144
Yes, thank you, that was a clap.

125
00:11:28,144 --> 00:11:34,989
Excellent sound design highlights and uplifts the best parts of our games.

126
00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:41,174
They make the highs even more exciting and the lows even more emotional.

127
00:11:41,174 --> 00:11:45,597
And an excellent soundtrack can stick with us long past finishing the game.

128
00:11:46,662 --> 00:11:50,802
I've had the elevator music for Dead Rising stuck in my head since 2006.

129
00:11:50,802 --> 00:11:53,843
I'm not going to sing it to you, don't worry.

130
00:11:53,843 --> 00:12:02,105
Creating exceptional sound design is a unique challenge, and I think we all underestimate

131
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:06,786
the impact and satisfaction that comes with a well-placed chime or crash.

132
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:13,287
So let's honor the nominees for Best Audio.

133
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:16,994
Returnal.

134
00:12:16,994 --> 00:12:19,955

145
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:53,793

published by Xbox Game Studios.

150
00:13:25,637 --> 00:13:28,558
Mike Brown, Don Arcata,

151
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:34,639
Gareth Harwood, Fraser Strachan.

152
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,660
The winner is Unpacking.

153
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:09,458
Holy crap!

154
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:09,898
**Cheering**

155
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:20,210
Uh, I think the, uh, key word here is, uh, underestimation.

156
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:27,138
I-I just totally underestimated the size of this game and the reaction to this game.

157
00:14:27,138 --> 00:14:29,500
And, uh, look, I just really want to thank...

158
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:36,368
Tim and Ren for inventing this game, and the rest of the Witchbeam team,

159
00:14:36,368 --> 00:14:43,832
Nart and Angus and May and Emily for supporting us and just making this a reality.

160
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:46,193
And I couldn't, I just cannot believe this.

161
00:14:46,193 --> 00:14:48,195
Thank you very much!

162
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:17,555
Here tonight to present this year's Ambassador Award is video game writer and content creator Alana Pierce.

163
00:15:17,555 --> 00:15:22,860
Hello everyone. I struggle to think of a person who is more deserving of receiving this year's

164
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,343
Ambassador Award than my friend Stephen Spock.

165
00:15:32,082 --> 00:15:36,506
This award is for someone who has helped the games industry advance to a better place,

166
00:15:36,506 --> 00:15:41,651
and if I were to give Steve one criticism, it is that he has tirelessly tried so hard

167
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:46,475
to advance the games industry to a better place that it has probably come at his own

168
00:15:46,475 --> 00:15:46,915
expense.

169
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:52,521
Steve has effectively dedicated his life to championing video game accessibility, sometimes

170
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:55,063
even braving the inner workings of Reddit.

171
00:15:56,146 --> 00:16:00,168
Can you imagine telling Reddit you think disabled gamers should be able to play FromSoft games

172
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:04,310
and coming out of that on the other side filled with good vibes?

173
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:04,490
No.

174
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,271
No, you can't.

175
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:10,533
And yet, even though it is undoubtedly hard and taxing, Steve persists where others won't

176
00:16:10,533 --> 00:16:11,834
because Steve is the best of us.

177
00:16:11,834 --> 00:16:14,035
If you don't know Steven Spahn, you're missing out.

178
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:19,658
Not only because he's one of the funniest people I know, to be clear he paid me to put

179
00:16:19,658 --> 00:16:23,480
that in the script, I'll take the $50 after the award is done, thanks Steve, but he's

180
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,901
also incredibly accomplished.

181
00:16:25,237 --> 00:16:28,620
Steve is the Senior Director of Able Gamers, which is an organization that's dedicated

182
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:41,713
to improving accessibility in video games, and enabling more people with disabilities

183
00:16:41,713 --> 00:16:42,934
to be able to play video games.

184
00:16:42,934 --> 00:16:48,979
He recently managed to raise $1 million for Able Gamers for his 40th birthday as part

185
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:50,781
of a campaign he called Spawn Together.

186
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:54,069
That's more than most people have accomplished in our entire lifetimes,

187
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:56,471
and Steve did it to celebrate his own birthday.

188
00:16:56,471 --> 00:17:01,896
Most of us sleep in a little bit longer and order a pizza.

189
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,458
Steve banded together a huge team of people to raise a million dollars,

190
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,780
all in the name of providing gaming peripherals and hardware

191
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,083
to people who may not be able to play games without them.

192
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,304
He also managed to repeatedly murder me in Among Us,

193
00:17:12,304 --> 00:17:15,807
and beat me in Fall Guys repeatedly, probably all in the same day.

194
00:17:15,807 --> 00:17:17,569
Actually, I take back everything that I've said.

195
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,770
Steve is horrible.

196
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,991
Hashtag cancel Steven's phone.

197
00:17:22,462 --> 00:17:24,763
But really, outside of his work directly with AbleGamers,

198
00:17:24,763 --> 00:17:27,004
and his work being the only righteous troll

199
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,785
in the entirety of Twitter.

200
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:30,787
Steve has also done a tremendous job

201
00:17:30,787 --> 00:17:32,608
of recruiting people outside of the industry

202
00:17:32,608 --> 00:17:34,249
to talk about video game accessibility.

203
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:36,010
People like Ryan Reynolds and Brie Larson,

204
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,391
some of the biggest streamers and content creators

205
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,052
can't help but be on Steve's side.

206
00:17:40,052 --> 00:17:42,074
And this is supposed to be a speech about his work,

207
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:43,375
but I can't go on without mentioning

208
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:46,256
that part of it is because he's so incredibly kind,

209
00:17:46,256 --> 00:17:48,318
engaging, charismatic, and...

210
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:55,962
Incredibly ridiculously handsome. Okay, now he's just editing the teleprompter. He can't keep getting away with this

211
00:17:55,962 --> 00:18:00,526
I could talk for a really really long time about why I'm honored to call Steve one of my best friends and how I'm so

212
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:03,608
Proud to have been asked to present him with this year's Ambassador Award

213
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:11,275
But I'm worried that he has slipped more sly compliments about himself into my script. So that is it for me. Welcome Steve Spahn everybody

214
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:42,215
She doesn't realize I can't hold that award.

215
00:18:42,215 --> 00:18:54,188
It's an honor and a privilege to share this evening of inscription with you.

216
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:57,697
Years ago, before my first industry event,

217
00:18:57,697 --> 00:19:00,478
I stayed up all night meticulously writing

218
00:19:00,478 --> 00:19:03,919
the importance of helping people with disabilities.

219
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,540
The very first day, I presented that information

220
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,160
to a lead developer at Rockstar Games.

221
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,541
He ignored me.

222
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,942
Instead, looking right over my wheelchair,

223
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:16,162
directly at my invisibly disabled,

224
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:18,643
able gamers partner, Mark Barlet,

225
00:19:18,643 --> 00:19:21,104
then crumpled up the pamphlet,

226
00:19:21,104 --> 00:19:24,125
threw it in the trash, and walked away.

227
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:24,445
I was devastated.

228
00:19:25,253 --> 00:19:31,037
It was at that moment that I knew there was no seat at the table for someone like me.

229
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:35,000
So I set out and made my mission to make one.

230
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:42,185
People tell me I am strong, resilient, inspirational, but I'm here to tell you that I am not.

231
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:43,446
I am here.

232
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:49,190
I didn't quit because my options were to be those things or die.

233
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,230
I chose not death.

234
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,832
I didn't choose this life.

235
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,494
but I'm gonna make every second of it count.

236
00:20:16,854 --> 00:20:17,755
It is just impossible.

237
00:20:17,755 --> 00:20:21,858
Do you know how many times as a person with a terminal disease

238
00:20:21,858 --> 00:20:27,241
and as a disabled man as I am that I have been told the words,

239
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:28,702
it's impossible?

240
00:20:28,702 --> 00:20:30,724
You're never going to live past 10 years old.

241
00:20:30,724 --> 00:20:31,945
It's impossible.

242
00:20:31,945 --> 00:20:34,226
You won't live long enough to see the end of college.

243
00:20:34,226 --> 00:20:35,287
It's impossible.

244
00:20:35,287 --> 00:20:36,828
You're never going to find love.

245
00:20:36,828 --> 00:20:38,609
It's impossible.

246
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:43,032
You'll never make people care about game accessibility.

247
00:20:43,032 --> 00:20:43,993
It's impossible.

248
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,255
I am here to tell you that not everything is impossible.

249
00:20:58,822 --> 00:21:03,146
One thing that I have learned is if you fight for your limitations,

250
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:05,007
you will never lose them.

251
00:21:05,007 --> 00:21:08,950
Never limit yourself or allow others to put limitations on you.

252
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,213
You must trade your cynicism for optimism.

253
00:21:13,213 --> 00:21:17,016
The truth is, being disabled is very difficult.

254
00:21:17,016 --> 00:21:21,800
For people like me, we don't get a break.

255
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,483
There are no weekends, no vacations from being disabled,

256
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:28,425
and no break for people taking care of us either.

257
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,201
at being an advocate on top of that,

258
00:21:31,201 --> 00:21:34,483
where not only do you have to deal with your own challenges,

259
00:21:34,483 --> 00:21:37,685
but you have to convince others to change the system

260
00:21:37,685 --> 00:21:40,046
that makes things so difficult.

261
00:21:40,046 --> 00:21:44,768
There are moments where it all just seems too much,

262
00:21:44,768 --> 00:21:47,950
where I don't know if I want to do this anymore.

263
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,833
But in my darkest moments, I am thankful for my support network,

264
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:56,655
for my mom, for my friends who remind me that every failure,

265
00:21:56,655 --> 00:22:02,718
every setback, and every difficult day is an opportunity to grow

266
00:22:02,718 --> 00:22:04,779
and become a better person.

267
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:07,681
And when all else fails, I have video games.

268
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:25,523
I have one place where I can retreat, collect myself after a bad day,

269
00:22:25,523 --> 00:22:28,185
enjoy exploring the universe with a friend,

270
00:22:28,185 --> 00:22:32,006
defeating dragons with my family, make a new friend,

271
00:22:32,006 --> 00:22:34,628
or even meet the love of my life.

272
00:22:34,628 --> 00:22:38,490
For disabled players, video games can provide a window

273
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:42,932
into an otherwise inaccessible world and provide opportunities

274
00:22:42,932 --> 00:22:48,275
to share experiences that might actually be impossible anywhere else.

275
00:22:48,655 --> 00:22:55,420
We just have to make sure that they are as accessible as they can be to as many people as they can be.

276
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:02,464
I chose to make it my life's work to represent, to be the representation I couldn't find when I entered this industry.

277
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,165
But I didn't get here alone.

278
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:12,771
I'm forever grateful for everyone who ever believed in me, believed I could win a prestigious award like this one.

279
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:14,712
And even when I didn't believe in myself.

280
00:23:14,712 --> 00:23:17,134
Advocacy is hard.

281
00:23:17,134 --> 00:23:18,395
Making games is hard.

282
00:23:18,985 --> 00:23:20,968
So I'll make you a deal.

283
00:23:20,968 --> 00:23:26,597
Together, we can ensure that this is an inclusive industry for everyone.

284
00:23:26,597 --> 00:23:28,059
I'm not going to stop.

285
00:23:28,059 --> 00:23:28,440
I won't quit.

286
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,523
And neither should you.

287
00:24:14,615 --> 00:24:17,957
What an exceptional speech from an exceptional person.

288
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:31,846
Tim, this is you, right?

289
00:24:31,846 --> 00:24:38,010
Thank you, Stephen, for all that you do.

290
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,431
A truly well-deserved award.

291
00:24:40,431 --> 00:24:42,833
I'm honored to share the stage with you.

292
00:24:54,313 --> 00:24:56,854
If I've learned anything from tonight,

293
00:24:56,854 --> 00:24:59,575
it's that everyone needs to name their games in a way

294
00:24:59,575 --> 00:25:03,257
that makes puns easier.

295
00:25:03,257 --> 00:25:05,898
How do I make a pun out of Forza Horizon 5

296
00:25:05,898 --> 00:25:07,779
or Guardians of the Galaxy?

297
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:10,800
I mean, writing puns is hard,

298
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,121
but writing games is even harder.

299
00:25:14,121 --> 00:25:20,204
Every year, we talk about how far game narratives have come.

300
00:25:20,204 --> 00:25:23,245
And it would feel like a cliche if it wasn't so true.

301
00:25:25,028 --> 00:25:29,591
Video game narrative progresses leaps and bounds every year

302
00:25:29,591 --> 00:25:33,214
as we continue to learn that having a cohesive,

303
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:37,096
engaging narrative can pull an entire game together

304
00:25:37,096 --> 00:25:40,018
and help us see ourselves in each other's art.

305
00:25:40,018 --> 00:25:46,443
And I think connecting and seeing each other in that way

306
00:25:46,443 --> 00:25:48,344
is more important now than ever.

307
00:25:48,344 --> 00:25:52,587
Here are the nominees for the Best Narrative Award.

308
00:25:54,863 --> 00:25:56,464
Best Narrative

309
00:25:56,464 --> 00:26:15,975
Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, developed by Eidos Montreal, published by Square Enix. Mary DeMorrow.

310
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:24,720
Deathloop, developed by Arcane Lyon, published by Bethesda Softworks.

311
00:26:25,732 --> 00:26:29,195
Are you talking about us?

312
00:26:29,195 --> 00:26:29,835
It Takes Two.

313
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:31,516
Developed by Hazelight Studios.

314
00:26:31,516 --> 00:26:36,140
Published by Electronic Arts.

315
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,600
Yeah!

316
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,461
What are you doing?

317
00:26:37,461 --> 00:26:38,002
You're not feeling it?

318
00:26:38,002 --> 00:26:38,062
No!

319
00:26:38,062 --> 00:26:43,406
I don't feel you!

320
00:26:43,406 --> 00:26:45,307
Psychonauts 2.

321
00:26:45,307 --> 00:26:49,131
Developed by Double Fine Productions.

322
00:26:49,131 --> 00:26:51,152
Published by Xbox Game Studios.

323
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:51,833
Tim Schafer.

324
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,783
Unpacking, developed by Witchbeam, published by Humble Games.

325
00:27:03,783 --> 00:27:09,447
Ren Breyer, Tim Dawson, Annie Vandermeer.

326
00:27:09,447 --> 00:27:20,075
Why did it make these so hard to open?

327
00:27:20,075 --> 00:27:24,758
And the winner is Psychonauts 2.

328
00:27:52,898 --> 00:27:56,083
Thank you so much, oh my god.

329
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:59,888
I wanna officially declare this purple jacket uncursed.

330
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:01,839
The jacket is uncursed.

331
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,740
There's so many people, when you say narrative,

332
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,182
there's so many people on that team that make things happen.

333
00:28:07,182 --> 00:28:09,864
There is a script, and there's a producer who organizes the script,

334
00:28:09,864 --> 00:28:12,045
and a casting director, and a director in the studio,

335
00:28:12,045 --> 00:28:14,827
and an engineer, and an actor who brings so much life to the characters,

336
00:28:14,827 --> 00:28:17,169
and animators who add so many jokes and so much life to it,

337
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:19,330
and then programmers who make the whole scene.

338
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,072
You actually play all the dialogue, play properly,

339
00:28:22,072 --> 00:28:23,353
and people edit the dialogue,

340
00:28:23,353 --> 00:28:25,534
and an effects artist puts a tear in the character's eye,

341
00:28:25,534 --> 00:28:26,995
and someone plays music, and then you cry,

342
00:28:26,995 --> 00:28:28,856
and you're like, this game has such great narrative.

343
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,842
But none of those people are here tonight, so I'm going to say it's just a script.

344
00:28:32,842 --> 00:28:34,704
Except for Zach, he's here.

345
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:38,850
Everybody, Zach, our lead, our animation lead on Tekken Ops 2, please say something.

346
00:28:41,123 --> 00:28:45,969
Hey everyone, it's an amazing honor. I mean, it all goes to Tim, obviously.

347
00:28:45,969 --> 00:28:50,314
That's the credit, goes to him. But I was honored to be...

348
00:28:50,314 --> 00:28:51,435
15 minutes of cutscenes.

349
00:28:51,435 --> 00:28:57,622
Well, yeah, yeah. We had about six hours worth of animation cutscenes in our game at the end.

350
00:28:57,622 --> 00:29:02,447
But I'd like to thank my animation team for bringing his script to life.

351
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:11,376
Chris, Miyuki, Ray, Jerry, Faith, Alex, and our amazing rigger, Adam.

352
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:14,139
Thank you all. It was just an amazing time.

353
00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:19,405
And thank you, Tim, for making these amazing worlds and characters for us to bring to life.

354
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:20,666
Thanks so much!

355
00:29:34,878 --> 00:29:42,421
So I started working in the industry at a time that was more hostile to people with my complexion.

356
00:29:42,421 --> 00:29:51,325
Microaggressions were commonplace. I learned to develop thick skin when I was a junior with no

357
00:29:51,325 --> 00:30:00,008
power to enact any change or even to speak up. And even as I climbed the ranks and got the

358
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:04,150
COVID-19 senior title, I faced many difficulties.

359
00:30:06,332 --> 00:30:09,934
I've attended conferences with an all-white diversity panel.

360
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:13,756
I've spoken at conferences where I was

361
00:30:13,756 --> 00:30:17,158
the only non-white person in the advocacy track.

362
00:30:17,158 --> 00:30:22,521
I've been the target of alt-right hate groups

363
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,222
who wanted to get me fired.

364
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:30,666
And through, sorry, and though we still have many problems

365
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:33,027
as an industry that we must address.

366
00:30:34,125 --> 00:30:36,866
we have to take a moment to celebrate how far we've come.

367
00:30:36,866 --> 00:30:43,691
All games have the potential to have a positive impact.

368
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:46,673
More and more games are rising to that challenge,

369
00:30:46,673 --> 00:30:50,315
working hard to be inclusive and thoughtful

370
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:52,976
and to inspire empathy in all of us

371
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,878
for the betterment of humankind.

372
00:30:55,878 --> 00:30:59,140
So let's celebrate the most culturally impactful games

373
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,741

As the studio head of Kitfox and lead designer and writer of Boyfriend Dungeon, thank you

400
00:32:56,535 --> 00:32:58,815
so much to those of you who...

401
00:32:59,425 --> 00:33:06,410
I felt Boyfriend Dungeon deserved the Social Impact Award, but it's really rewarding because

402
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:09,492
it's really the reason why I enjoy making games.

403

I want to think about the person playing it and what they're feeling, and my greatest

dream is to affect culture in a positive way.

405

Thank you.

424
00:34:43,299 --> 00:34:46,380
So, last year, the Dragon Quest series of role-playing games

425
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,101
celebrated its 35th anniversary.

426
00:34:48,535 --> 00:34:53,877
It's an iconic genre-defining series that sold more than 70 million copies around the world,

427
00:34:53,877 --> 00:34:59,059
produced any number of successful spin-offs, and been adapted into movies and television.

428
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:02,301
There's even a Dragon Quest-themed cafe in the heart of Tokyo.

429
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:08,183
When I was a kid, I fell in love with the original Dragon Quest for the Nintendo Entertainment System,

430
00:35:08,183 --> 00:35:10,764
published as Dragon Warrior here in the States, though...

431
00:35:11,215 --> 00:35:16,420
I never could have imagined that the series would have such a steady presence with me through most of my life.

432
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,721
It's still going strong.

433
00:35:17,721 --> 00:35:21,244
Dragon Quest XI launched in 2017 to widespread acclaim,

434
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:24,246
and Dragon Quest XII was announced less than a year ago.

435
00:35:24,246 --> 00:35:26,848
But what's more amazing to me than that,

436
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:30,131
and even more amazing than all the phenomenal worldwide success,

437
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:34,414
is that Dragon Quest's original creator, designer, and writer,

438
00:35:34,414 --> 00:35:37,096
Yuji Horii-san, whom we are honoring this evening,

439
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:43,274
has been there for every single installment of this series all this time.

440
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:47,236
You would be very hard-pressed to find another creator in this industry

441
00:35:47,236 --> 00:35:51,638
who has stuck with their game series for more than 35 years,

442
00:35:51,638 --> 00:35:57,221
much less a game series of such influence and lasting impact as Dragon Quest.

443
00:35:57,221 --> 00:36:00,883
In an industry so fraught with uncertainty where so few...

444
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,443
have the privilege of stability in their work and in their lives,

445
00:36:04,443 --> 00:36:08,827
Hori-san and his collaborators managed to stick with their series,

446
00:36:08,827 --> 00:36:11,749
delivering beloved hit after hit for well over a quarter of a century.

447
00:36:11,749 --> 00:36:17,735
All this time, Hori-san has served as designer and writer on the series,

448
00:36:17,735 --> 00:36:22,759
creating these classic tales of good versus evil, and triumph over adversity,

449
00:36:22,759 --> 00:36:23,800
filled with heart and warmth,

450
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,263
and designed to be highly approachable for players of all ages.

451
00:36:27,835 --> 00:36:35,762
He's credited on many other games as well, notably as supervisor and scenario designer on the Super Nintendo classic Chrono Trigger.

452
00:36:35,762 --> 00:36:46,091
It overwhelms and inspires me, thinking about just how much joy Hori-san's work has brought to so many people in this world and for so long.

453
00:36:46,091 --> 00:36:50,114
In a 2011 interview reflecting on 25 years of Dragon Quest back then,

454
00:36:50,114 --> 00:36:53,637
Hori-san described the series as being about overcoming hardship.

455
00:36:54,507 --> 00:36:58,048
It's like climbing up a steep mountain," he said.

456
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:02,849
You have to keep climbing, climbing, climbing, climbing,

457
00:37:02,849 --> 00:37:05,950
and then at the end, you finally get to the top

458
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:09,691
of the mountain and you see the beautiful view.

459
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:13,232
I hope Hori-san has had a chance to see that by now.

460
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:15,952
Unfortunately, Yuji Hori-san was unable to travel

461
00:37:15,952 --> 00:37:18,113
to GDC this time around, but he sent us

462
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:20,073
a short acceptance video we would like

463
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:21,373
to share with you all now, thank you.

464
00:37:23,168 --> 00:37:25,009
Hello, I'm Yuri Horii.

465
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:35,814
Thank you for winning the GDC Award, which is a prestigious award.

466
00:37:35,814 --> 00:37:44,357
I've always loved manga, and I've always wanted to be a manga artist.

467
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:50,855
I was in the manga research department at university,

468
00:37:50,855 --> 00:37:55,319
and I helped to write manga and to make original works for professional manga artists.

469
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:57,000
I also wrote illustrations and articles for magazines.

470
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,605
After graduating from university, I worked as a freelance writer.

471
00:38:01,605 --> 00:38:05,949
At that time, the world was undergoing a big change.

472
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:07,730
The computer was introduced.

473
00:38:08,784 --> 00:38:16,869
I read about the computer in the newspaper and was fascinated by it.

474
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:23,213
I bought a microcomputer and a personal computer.

475
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:28,916
I had always liked math, but I became addicted to computers.

476
00:38:28,916 --> 00:38:33,619
I learned programming and started making my own games.

477
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:35,360
That's when I discovered Enix.

478
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:39,398
Square Enix was doing a game programming contest,

479
00:38:39,398 --> 00:38:43,021
and I was able to participate in my own game.

480
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:45,723
That was the beginning of my gaming life.

481
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:48,586
It was about 40 years ago.

482
00:38:48,586 --> 00:38:53,210
New Sensation was an action game for me to play as a hobby,

483
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,813
but I was invited to play it alone,

484
00:38:55,813 --> 00:39:01,678
so I decided to make an adventure game that I was interested in at the time.

485
00:39:02,314 --> 00:39:05,497
in a violent slaughtergoing between players.

486
00:39:05,497 --> 00:39:07,799
That is a serial killing in Fortopia,

487
00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:11,882
where a guy demands for a command

488
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:17,087
that will allow him to carry out murder in the real world.

489
00:39:17,087 --> 00:39:21,010
The game has been battered still more

490
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:24,073
and the tournament industry is booming.

491
00:39:25,423 --> 00:39:31,288
I think the appeal of computers is that they can program various reactions to input,

492
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:33,229
and I think that's what makes them so interesting.

493
00:39:33,229 --> 00:39:40,134
In other words, they create various gimmicks by imagining the player's actions.

494
00:39:40,134 --> 00:39:45,378
I thought it was a very fun job to create stories on this system.

495
00:39:45,378 --> 00:39:53,624
And I thought it would be very fun to make a story for RPGs like Wizardry Ultima, which I also like.

496
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:55,105
I'm looking forward to it.

497
00:39:56,946 --> 00:40:04,852
Dragon Quest will be released in a short time frame, just like the manga.

498
00:40:04,852 --> 00:40:10,375
I think it's like a manga written on a computer.

499
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:14,638
Our team is currently working on a new work, Dragon Quest XII,

500
00:40:14,638 --> 00:40:15,859
which is the new main story.

501
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:23,945
I think many people around the world will be able to play this work.

502
00:40:23,945 --> 00:40:26,307
Please look forward to the sequel.

503
00:40:36,731 --> 00:40:39,732
And we're back for blood.

504
00:40:39,732 --> 00:40:39,952
Blood.

505
00:40:39,952 --> 00:40:47,114
Blood.

506
00:40:47,114 --> 00:40:48,195
That was a little long.

507
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:57,818
The Oscars, the Grammys and the Golden Globes all have one thing in common.

508
00:40:57,818 --> 00:41:02,119
They do not have an innovation award category.

509
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:03,200
But we do.

510
00:41:09,918 --> 00:41:11,939
That's why it's so exciting to work on games.

511
00:41:11,939 --> 00:41:15,601
Every year, even after all of this time,

512
00:41:15,601 --> 00:41:19,183
there are thousands of games that do something

513
00:41:19,183 --> 00:41:21,844
we've never seen before.

514
00:41:21,844 --> 00:41:24,825
We have just barely scratched the surface

515
00:41:24,825 --> 00:41:26,826
of what's possible in our medium.

516
00:41:26,826 --> 00:41:30,728
And maybe someday, we might even be able

517
00:41:30,728 --> 00:41:32,709
to make a functioning door.

518
00:41:32,709 --> 00:41:36,451
What a time to be alive!

538
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,261
Okay.

539
00:43:47,261 --> 00:43:47,801
Uh, oh my god!

540
00:43:47,801 --> 00:43:49,622
Th- Thank you!

541
00:43:49,622 --> 00:43:49,682
Uh...

542
00:43:49,682 --> 00:43:50,002
Uh...

543
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:50,102
Uh...

544
00:43:50,102 --> 00:43:50,182
Uh...

545
00:43:50,182 --> 00:43:50,402
Uh...

546
00:43:50,402 --> 00:43:50,442
Uh...

547
00:43:50,442 --> 00:43:50,482
Uh...

548
00:43:50,482 --> 00:43:50,702
Uh...

549
00:43:50,702 --> 00:43:50,942
Uh...

550
00:43:50,942 --> 00:43:57,465
Uh...

551
00:43:57,465 --> 00:43:57,645
Uh...

552
00:43:57,645 --> 00:43:57,725
Uh...

553
00:43:57,725 --> 00:43:57,845
Uh...

554
00:43:57,845 --> 00:43:57,905
Uh...

555
00:43:57,905 --> 00:43:58,065
Uh...

556
00:43:58,065 --> 00:44:02,807
Four years ago, Tim arrived at my apartment with a pile of boxes in tow.

557
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:08,430
We'd been dating for a year and a bit, and, uh, that day marked an exciting new chapter in our lives.

558
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,831
It ended up being even more significant, though,

559
00:44:10,831 --> 00:44:14,332
because it was also the day we came up with an idea for a game about unpacking.

560
00:44:16,564 --> 00:44:20,669
Um, now I just, I can't believe how much this game has changed our lives.

561
00:44:20,669 --> 00:44:24,414
It's taken us around the world, introduced us to so many people, so

562
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:25,856
many opportunities, and now we're here.

563
00:44:25,856 --> 00:44:32,224
Um, everyone has been so nice and supportive all week so far.

564
00:44:32,224 --> 00:44:32,544
Um.

565
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:36,282
Yeah, I just can't believe it.

566
00:44:36,282 --> 00:44:40,085
And I could not have asked for a better team.

567
00:44:40,085 --> 00:44:43,128
Tim, who is the glue who holds this whole project together,

568
00:44:43,128 --> 00:44:45,810
and who also held me together through some

569
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:47,951
of the roughest patches.

570
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:50,653
Jeff, with more experience in games than the rest of us

571
00:44:50,653 --> 00:44:52,775
combined.

572
00:44:52,775 --> 00:44:56,558
Angus, who practically reinvented isometric pixel art

573
00:44:56,558 --> 00:44:57,358
working on this game.

574
00:44:57,358 --> 00:44:59,920
And the rest of our amazing art team, Michelle, Joe,

575
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,023
and Stacey, who each put a bit of themselves into the game.

576
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,241
and got it to an unbelievable level of polish.

577
00:45:05,241 --> 00:45:09,903
And Annie, who helped us come up with a believable cast

578
00:45:09,903 --> 00:45:12,424
of characters you never get to see.

579
00:45:12,424 --> 00:45:14,705
Damon, who helped us make the game more accessible

580
00:45:14,705 --> 00:45:17,086
with fully remappable controls.

581
00:45:17,086 --> 00:45:20,168
Victoria, with her god tier community management skills.

582
00:45:20,168 --> 00:45:22,429
And Emily, who took over from her recently

583
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:23,489
and has been smashing it.

584
00:45:24,284 --> 00:45:32,894
And of course, Sonatan, who has always believed in us and supported us through the good and the bad.

585
00:45:32,894 --> 00:45:37,220
Thank you all so much for making this game what it is, and

586
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,522
thanks everyone here in the audience.

587
00:45:39,522 --> 00:45:40,904
Yeah, thank you so much.

588
00:45:57,295 --> 00:46:02,380
I've been in games for nearly 15 years, and in that time, I've learned that games can

589
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:08,306
basically be boiled down to two ingredients, heart and math.

590
00:46:08,306 --> 00:46:15,393
I get the heart part, but math is really hard.

591
00:46:17,347 --> 00:46:20,748
Technology is advancing these days at the blink of an eye,

592
00:46:20,748 --> 00:46:25,309
and these developers are working even faster than that

593
00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:28,931
to bring us the best of what the new platforms

594
00:46:28,931 --> 00:46:31,912
and mechanics can accomplish in an interactive medium.

595
00:46:31,912 --> 00:46:37,874
I can't even tell you how much math is involved in that.

596
00:46:37,874 --> 00:46:38,794
It's incalculable.

597
00:46:38,794 --> 00:46:41,615
Thank you.

598
00:46:46,125 --> 00:46:57,748
So let's see the nominees for the award for everything that I'm not smart enough to understand in video games.

599
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,589
The Best Technology Award.

600
00:46:59,589 --> 00:47:00,449

Hitman 3. Developed by IO Interactive. Published by IO Interactive.

610
00:48:17,851 --> 00:48:19,828
And the winner is...

611
00:48:19,828 --> 00:48:20,595
Ratchet and Clank.

612
00:48:49,636 --> 00:48:52,537
All right.

613
00:48:52,537 --> 00:48:54,457
Excuse me, deep breath.

614
00:48:54,457 --> 00:48:57,578
This is way scarier than giving my talk earlier today.

615
00:48:57,578 --> 00:48:58,299
So, oh, sorry.

616
00:48:58,299 --> 00:49:00,779
Can you hear me now?

617
00:49:00,779 --> 00:49:02,580
All right.

618
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,881
First, thank you everyone.

619
00:49:04,881 --> 00:49:06,881
It's so humbling to be counted among

620
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:08,822
all the amazingly talented developers here.

621
00:49:08,822 --> 00:49:12,623
And it's an incredible honor to be recognized.

622
00:49:12,623 --> 00:49:15,064
I'd like to begin by thanking all of my colleagues

623
00:49:15,064 --> 00:49:15,844
that came up here with me.

624
00:49:16,265 --> 00:49:20,248
I was telling our director earlier this week that there was no way in hell I was going

625
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:21,109
to come up here by myself.

626
00:49:21,109 --> 00:49:23,491
This is truly terrifying.

627
00:49:23,491 --> 00:49:27,874
But on behalf of all the engineering teams at Insomniac, I'd like to begin by thanking

628
00:49:27,874 --> 00:49:29,216
all Insomniacs.

629
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:34,860
Without your vision and support, frankly, most of our games would be just really well-optimized

630
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:35,481
programmer art.

631
00:49:35,481 --> 00:49:40,986
I'd also like to thank the Advanced Technology Group, the ICE team, and all of the other

632
00:49:40,986 --> 00:49:43,528
tech wizards that built the platform that made Rift Apart possible.

633
00:49:44,352 --> 00:49:48,355
I'd also like to thank our family, friends, and loved ones that stood by us every step

634
00:49:48,355 --> 00:49:50,277
of the way as we brought Ratchet to the finish line.

635
00:49:50,277 --> 00:49:55,341
And finally, my good friend, Elan here, has a few additional words for us.

636
00:49:55,341 --> 00:49:58,123
Thank you.

637
00:49:58,123 --> 00:50:02,907
Thank you to everybody who supported every one of us when we were getting started.

638
00:50:02,907 --> 00:50:03,668
Pay it forward.

639
00:50:24,426 --> 00:50:30,009
As a career game designer, this is the category that's closest to my heart.

640
00:50:30,009 --> 00:50:35,431
When I started making games, there was a moment when I had a very hard time playing games.

641
00:50:35,431 --> 00:50:39,693
Something that I had done my whole life up to that point.

642
00:50:39,693 --> 00:50:46,476
All of a sudden, I was starting to see behind the curtain.

643
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:48,537
The magic was fading.

644
00:50:48,537 --> 00:50:51,138
I asked myself if I had made a mistake.

645
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:59,375
I wished that I could turn it off, to go back to how I used to play games.

646
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:05,120
As I was coming to terms with my new reality, something unexpected happened.

647
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:10,866
I was starting to develop a love for the craft that I didn't believe was possible.

648
00:51:10,866 --> 00:51:16,991
It was stronger than the love, than the one it replaced.

649
00:51:16,991 --> 00:51:17,272
Now

650
00:51:18,305 --> 00:51:24,049
I could see the source of the magic and the intentions behind it.

651
00:51:24,049 --> 00:51:30,054
Game design is invisible until it's not, and then its beauty can blind you.

652
00:51:30,054 --> 00:51:36,379
Here are the nominees for the Best Design Award.

653
00:51:36,379 --> 00:51:37,519
Best Design

654
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:46,606

Tim Schafer, Seth Marinello.

658
00:52:06,631 --> 00:52:10,112
Woo!

659
00:52:10,112 --> 00:52:14,814

666
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:48,071
Daniel Mullins.

667
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:00,342
And the winner is...

668
00:53:00,342 --> 00:53:00,682
It Takes Two!

669
00:53:00,682 --> 00:53:13,271
The Best Design Award winner couldn't be here tonight,

670
00:53:13,271 --> 00:53:15,192
but they've sent you here.

671
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:17,173
They sent us an acceptance thank you.

672
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:29,599
I hope you could read fast.

673
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:30,139
Applause

674
00:53:30,139 --> 00:53:47,295
Please join me in taking a moment to remember those colleagues, peers, mentors and friends who we lost this year.

675
00:53:47,295 --> 00:53:54,201
Every single one of them has made a tremendous contribution to our art and our industry.

676
00:53:54,201 --> 00:53:56,503
They will never be forgotten.

677
00:56:14,878 --> 00:56:23,185
Okay. I have another one for you. What do you call a Deathloop sequel set in a restaurant?

678
00:56:28,357 --> 00:56:28,737
Death Soup.

679
00:56:28,737 --> 00:56:33,939
Death Soup.

680
00:56:33,939 --> 00:56:34,379
Death Soup.

681
00:56:34,379 --> 00:56:34,839
Death Soup.

682
00:56:34,839 --> 00:56:39,841
The drums were too loud.

683
00:56:39,841 --> 00:56:41,761
The joke wasn't bad.

684
00:56:41,761 --> 00:56:45,283
It was the drums, right?

685
00:56:45,283 --> 00:56:47,463
It's okay, everyone.

686
00:56:47,463 --> 00:56:49,484
We're getting to the end here.

687
00:56:49,484 --> 00:56:49,864
Be patient.

688
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:51,865
I'm almost out of puns.

689
00:56:51,865 --> 00:56:52,785
I'm almost out of puns.

690
00:56:54,033 --> 00:56:59,517
I know that everyone wishes that they could vote on which of my jokes was the best tonight.

691
00:56:59,517 --> 00:57:02,880
But here we have the Audience Award instead.

692
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:11,167
The Audience Award is always one of my favorite because it could be literally any game that wins.

693
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,528
I think Wordle has a shot this year.

694
00:57:12,528 --> 00:57:16,011
All right.

695
00:57:16,011 --> 00:57:20,575
So here are the winners of the, sorry, here is the winner of our Audience Award.

696
00:57:24,922 --> 00:57:26,403
Ready for it?

697
00:57:26,403 --> 00:57:28,544
Valheim.

698
00:57:28,544 --> 00:57:44,074
So the Audience Award winner couldn't be here tonight,

699
00:57:44,074 --> 00:57:46,216
but they've sent this acceptance message.

700
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:48,117
Hi, I'm Lisa.

701
00:57:48,117 --> 00:57:49,038
I'm Robin.

702
00:57:49,038 --> 00:57:51,760
And I'm Josephine, and we're from Iron Gate.

703
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:55,627
Thank you so much for giving us this year's Audience Award.

704
00:57:55,627 --> 00:57:57,468
It means so much to us that you like our game.

705
00:57:57,468 --> 00:58:00,128
It's been a lot to have your support this year,

706
00:58:00,128 --> 00:58:13,192
and we really hope that you'll continue to love the game for a long time to come.

707
00:58:13,192 --> 00:58:14,052
We're finally here.

708
00:58:14,052 --> 00:58:17,293
It's the biggest award of the night,

709
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:19,833
but it's still not bigger than Lady Dimitrescu.

710
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:27,964
Alright, wait. I had a joke for this one. Hold on.

711
00:58:27,964 --> 00:58:30,325
What do you call it when Lady Dimitrescu...

712
00:58:30,325 --> 00:58:31,586
Wait, I messed up her name.

713
00:58:31,586 --> 00:58:34,589
Lady Dimitrescu spills her drink?

714
00:58:34,589 --> 00:58:39,112
Resident Evil spillage.

715
00:58:39,112 --> 00:58:39,873
Yeah!

716
00:58:39,873 --> 00:58:39,993
Yeah!

717
00:58:39,993 --> 00:58:40,113
Yeah!

718
00:58:40,113 --> 00:58:42,315
Yeah!

719
00:58:42,315 --> 00:58:42,875
Yeah!

720
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:43,375
Yeah!

721
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:45,817
Yeah!

722
00:58:45,817 --> 00:58:46,218
Yeah!

723
00:58:46,218 --> 00:58:46,718
Yeah!

724
00:58:46,718 --> 00:58:47,118
Yeah!

725
00:58:47,118 --> 00:58:47,359
Yeah!

726
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:47,439
Yeah!

727
00:58:47,439 --> 00:58:48,339
Is it getting better or worse?

728
00:58:48,339 --> 00:58:49,460
I... that? Okay. Alright.

729
00:58:52,081 --> 00:59:00,267
So here it is, our Game of the Year award.

730
00:59:00,267 --> 00:59:05,551
These nominees represent some of the best voices, best

731
00:59:05,551 --> 00:59:10,856
technology, best design, best narrative, and best innovation

732
00:59:10,856 --> 00:59:14,098
that our industry has to offer, all wrapped up

733
00:59:14,098 --> 00:59:16,100
into five spectacular games.

734
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,602
Each of them deserve to win.

735
00:59:19,267 --> 00:59:23,050
for being not only an example of where we are now,

736
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:26,732
but a glimpse of where our industry is headed as a whole.

737
00:59:26,732 --> 00:59:30,475
Here are the nominees for the Game of the Year.

738

746
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:12,632

751
01:00:48,761 --> 01:00:49,002
I feel stuck.

752
01:00:55,744 --> 01:01:01,553
And the winner of the 2022 Game Developers Choice Award

753
01:01:01,553 --> 01:01:06,421
for the game of the year goes to Inscription.

754
01:01:28,485 --> 01:01:30,285
That one was really unexpected.

755
01:01:30,285 --> 01:01:32,906
I don't know how you compare those games.

756
01:01:32,906 --> 01:01:36,206
I think, like, should you have made the cars faster

757
01:01:36,206 --> 01:01:37,287
in Forza or something?

758
01:01:37,287 --> 01:01:37,547
Like, uh...

759
01:01:37,547 --> 01:01:40,307
But I was trying to think, like,

760
01:01:40,307 --> 01:01:42,388
I didn't think this one would happen,

761
01:01:42,388 --> 01:01:43,648
but I was trying to rack my brain

762
01:01:43,648 --> 01:01:45,189
for some, like, thank you deep cuts.

763
01:01:45,189 --> 01:01:48,189
So I was thinking of thanking my grandma

764
01:01:48,189 --> 01:01:50,250
for being one-fourth of my genes,

765
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:53,631
but also she actually is the voice

766
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:55,691
of Grimora in Inscription.

767
01:01:55,691 --> 01:01:57,752
So she is a voice actor.

768
01:01:59,024 --> 01:02:05,827
My dad let me film him and I he's a secret boss in inscription and there's one version of him that

769
01:02:05,827 --> 01:02:13,591
has like a yoga like pillow on his head and he's supposed to look like a mushroom man and he he put

770
01:02:13,591 --> 01:02:15,412
up with that um and that's cool thank you and thank

771
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:31,771
As we wrap up our night, I believe my total pun and dad joke count comes to about 13.

772
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:34,932
We call that a Troy Baker's dozen.

773
01:02:34,932 --> 01:02:39,733
All right, that's 14, right?

774
01:02:39,733 --> 01:02:46,095
Genuinely, I would like to end the show by giving a final congratulations to all of the

775
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:52,436
winners and all of the nominees and everyone who shipped or even worked on a game this

776
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:52,737
past year.

777
01:03:03,315 --> 01:03:06,437
You've done the impossible time and time again.

778
01:03:06,437 --> 01:03:11,600
I admire all of you and consider myself extremely lucky to be your colleague.

779
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:17,624
I'd like to thank everyone who made this show safe and possible.

780
01:03:17,624 --> 01:03:24,429
The production crew backstage, the GDC organizers, the volunteers, and the CAs who brought us

781
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:26,210
all back together this evening.

782
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:28,812
Please give them a round of applause.

783
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:47,414
I'd like to end by asking everyone who's watching here and back home to cross your arms like this.

784
01:03:47,414 --> 01:03:50,956
Do it.

785
01:03:50,956 --> 01:03:54,978
Now, squeeze gently.

786
01:03:54,978 --> 01:04:02,602
We've all just shared a much needed communal hug.

787
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:18,804
The past few years have been really tough, but we have each other and we will get through

788
01:04:18,804 --> 01:04:18,884
this.

789
01:04:18,884 --> 01:04:22,246
So thanks for coming and for watching.

790
01:04:22,246 --> 01:04:27,848
Please stay safe, and don't forget, we're stronger together.

791
01:04:41,989 --> 01:04:42,129
You
