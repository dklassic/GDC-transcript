00:00:05,887 --> 00:00:10,589
Good afternoon, and welcome, hi, to the Design versus Story,

2
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:13,190
How Uncharted, The Lost Legacy, Addressed

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,431
the Elephant in the Room.

4
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:14,531
Woo!

5
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:14,611
Woo!

6
00:00:16,452 --> 00:00:16,512
Woo!

7
00:00:16,632 --> 00:00:16,692
Woo!

8
00:00:16,732 --> 00:00:16,792
Woo!

9
00:00:16,812 --> 00:00:22,134
Woo!

10
00:00:22,154 --> 00:00:22,214
Woo!

11
00:00:22,234 --> 00:00:22,354
Woo!

12
00:00:22,374 --> 00:00:22,434
Woo!

13
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:22,514
Woo!

14
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:22,595
Woo!

15
00:00:22,615 --> 00:00:22,735
Woo!

16
00:00:22,755 --> 00:00:22,855
Woo!

17
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:22,975
Woo!

18
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:23,355
Woo!

19
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:23,895
I'm Marianne Hayden.

20
00:00:23,915 --> 00:00:25,716
I'm a story animator at Naughty Dog.

21
00:00:26,356 --> 00:00:29,077
I've been a story animator currently on The Last of Us

22
00:00:29,117 --> 00:00:31,398
Part 2 and Uncharted, The Lost Legacy.

23
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:34,260
I was a cinematics animator for Uncharted 1, 2, 3, and 4.

24
00:00:37,865 --> 00:00:39,686
I've been at Naughty Dog for about 10 years.

25
00:00:40,226 --> 00:00:42,347
I've worked on everything from cinematics

26
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:45,248
to scripted sequences to level gameplay animations.

27
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:47,389
I also jump in the suit every once in a while

28
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:48,750
and get on the motion capture stage.

29
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:52,591
So first, let's answer the question,

30
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:53,871
what is a story animator?

31
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:56,533
Well, a story animator is different

32
00:00:56,553 --> 00:00:57,673
than a cinematics animator.

33
00:00:58,253 --> 00:01:00,474
We aid the design team and our writers

34
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:03,455
with animation ideas of how to progress character

35
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:05,316
and story development during gameplay.

36
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,721
Our goal is, in between these two images,

37
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:12,502
help create high-quality gameplay while combining

38
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:15,543
design and story that stays true to the overall vision

39
00:01:15,623 --> 00:01:18,965
and narrative without becoming boring or confusing

40
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:20,565
and losing sight of our end goal.

41
00:01:24,047 --> 00:01:26,008
We are assigned levels and responsible

42
00:01:26,068 --> 00:01:28,289
for all scripted sequences in those levels.

43
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:32,731
When we create these sequences, IGCs, in-game cutscenes,

44
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:35,872
or POIs, points of interest, this is what goes into it.

45
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,562
We previs the scenes by blocking out animations pose to pose,

46
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:43,044
try to get correct timing, including a rough camera pass,

47
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:45,566
and then we direct the motion capture shoots

48
00:01:45,626 --> 00:01:46,406
with our stunt actors.

49
00:01:48,628 --> 00:01:51,289
Uncharted, The Lost Legacy, was on such a tight deadline

50
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,251
that most of our previs was shot on the motion capture stage

51
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:57,233
before we even got animations implemented into the game.

52
00:01:57,894 --> 00:02:00,295
We didn't have time for traditional previs, which

53
00:02:00,615 --> 00:02:02,376
also meant a lot of reshoots.

54
00:02:04,138 --> 00:02:06,379
We made a 10-hour game in less than a year.

55
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:08,618
So if that explains any of that.

56
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:12,219
Then we get the data back from the stage

57
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:13,619
and we assemble the Maya scenes.

58
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:15,959
We use tracks for Lost Legacy and we're

59
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:17,840
using Time Editor for The Last of Us 2.

60
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,480
And we edit the clips together for correct timing.

61
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:25,621
Then we work with design to get interactive moments

62
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:27,361
functional in script and in game.

63
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,762
At Naughty Dog, we don't have producers per department.

64
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,663
So a lot of the production work that comes with these scenes

65
00:02:33,723 --> 00:02:34,723
is our responsibility.

66
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,333
We communicate with our background artists,

67
00:02:37,453 --> 00:02:39,494
our foreground artists, effects, audio,

68
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:41,436
our writers to make sure we have scripts

69
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:42,937
before we go to the stage to shoot.

70
00:02:43,637 --> 00:02:45,739
We have to make sure the scene has everything that it needs.

71
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:51,463
We assign the scenes to animators,

72
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:54,204
review and manage the scenes up until polish

73
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:56,246
until the game is locked and we're ready to ship.

74
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:58,447
That's the general idea of what the role

75
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:00,229
of a story animator is at Naughty Dog.

76
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:02,770
And if I'm lucky, I get to keep a few animations

77
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,551
like this one to work on from start to finish.

78
00:03:09,308 --> 00:03:11,810
Design at Naughty Dog often influences story,

79
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:14,012
and story often influences design.

80
00:03:14,952 --> 00:03:17,494
Story and gameplay are developed in concert.

81
00:03:17,674 --> 00:03:19,376
One often does not come before the other.

82
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:22,598
Naughty Dog frequently creates scripted sequences

83
00:03:22,618 --> 00:03:24,060
where the player has limited control

84
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,521
and still allows to maintain a cinematic moment.

85
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:30,004
And these moments in games are always more emotional

86
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,286
and have more impact when they're on the stick

87
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:34,508
and somewhat interactive, unlike cut scenes.

88
00:03:36,203 --> 00:03:39,344
And over the years, the seesaw has tilted back and forth

89
00:03:39,484 --> 00:03:41,605
from design to story and vice versa.

90
00:03:42,225 --> 00:03:43,866
And this can present challenges.

91
00:03:44,966 --> 00:03:47,486
Sometimes we have a design idea that's so unusual

92
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:51,688
that it could support the story in a better way than a cut

93
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:51,928
scene.

94
00:03:52,528 --> 00:03:54,888
So we find a way to incorporate into the story,

95
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:56,809
no matter what the complexity and the cost.

96
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:00,370
The elephant ride in Uncharted, The Lost Legacy

97
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,610
is one of those moments.

98
00:04:03,592 --> 00:04:05,492
So just curious, how many of you have played

99
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:06,592
Uncharted, The Lost Legacy?

100
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:09,233
Awesome, not enough hands.

101
00:04:10,313 --> 00:04:12,693
After the talk, go buy it and help support my family.

102
00:04:12,713 --> 00:04:19,175
So if you're unfamiliar, it's a spin-off

103
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:21,055
of the Uncharted series featuring Chloe,

104
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:23,035
a character from Uncharted 2, Among Thieves,

105
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:25,956
and Nadine Ross, a character from Uncharted 4,

106
00:04:26,176 --> 00:04:26,816
A Thief's End.

107
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:29,496
I'm going to play that six-minute sequence

108
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,937
that this talk is about, and then I'm going to talk

109
00:04:31,957 --> 00:04:33,337
about our process, what worked.

110
00:04:33,747 --> 00:04:35,988
what didn't work and what some of our challenges were.

111
00:04:36,128 --> 00:04:39,589
So if you don't want any spoilers here's your chance to leave.

112
00:04:59,637 --> 00:05:04,738
How to ride and get on a wild elephant was one of our biggest challenges in this story beat.

113
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,381
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's okay. She's tripped, but I don't think she's wounded.

114
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:19,783
Those explosions we heard must have triggered the collapse. Easy girl. It's okay.

115
00:05:23,244 --> 00:05:25,165
Sorry girl, we're gonna get you out.

116
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,541
Just a bit more.

117
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:35,742
Just a bit more.

118
00:05:35,762 --> 00:05:36,562
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

119
00:05:36,582 --> 00:05:37,162
Wait a minute.

120
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:38,422
We need to get down.

121
00:05:38,643 --> 00:05:39,983
Just stay calm.

122
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:41,923
Are you talking to me or the elephant?

123
00:05:42,183 --> 00:05:42,583
Both?

124
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,924
Easy, easy.

125
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:50,845
Easy does it.

126
00:05:50,865 --> 00:05:51,766
Okay, then.

127
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:53,946
Where's it taking us?

128
00:05:54,906 --> 00:05:55,807
Wherever it wants.

129
00:05:56,998 --> 00:06:00,299
At this point in the story, these two characters aren't on very good terms.

130
00:06:00,339 --> 00:06:01,540
They really don't like each other.

131
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,563
And but small talk isn't their thing.

132
00:06:08,163 --> 00:06:09,284
And they're stuck on this elephant.

133
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:10,104
You can't get off of it.

134
00:06:10,444 --> 00:06:12,685
And ultimately they need to figure out a way to work together.

135
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:16,287
So once they're on the elephant, there wasn't much for the player to do.

136
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:20,349
We gave the player a couple opportunities to feed the elephant.

137
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,710
So if you missed that last branch, then there would be another chance

138
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,151
for the next overhang to get that.

139
00:06:26,236 --> 00:06:29,819
We wanted to take time to focus on our environment art

140
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:30,880
in this sequence as well.

141
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,723
So we would focus the camera on things

142
00:06:34,763 --> 00:06:35,884
like this upcoming vista.

143
00:06:37,726 --> 00:06:40,828
We wanted to populate the area with monkeys that, monkeys

144
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:43,110
and animals, other kind of animals that might be

145
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,852
in this environment as well.

146
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:50,977
One more.

147
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:20,058
This cutscene is a bonding moment between these two characters, and it actually was

148
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,379
written for a different part of the game.

149
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:25,440
But when this story beat was created, we moved it to the back of the elephant.

150
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:33,602
You're a selfish dickhead.

151
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:36,505
Yeah.

152
00:07:38,547 --> 00:07:38,947
You're right.

153
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:41,890
I am a selfish dickhead.

154
00:07:44,392 --> 00:07:45,473
Yeah.

155
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:48,816
It's good to hear you say it.

156
00:07:49,497 --> 00:07:50,978
Well, did you hear that, Dad?

157
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:53,120
I did get something from you after all.

158
00:07:57,745 --> 00:07:58,465
What happened with your father?

159
00:08:02,872 --> 00:08:04,373
He was the guy that couldn't walk away.

160
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:11,557
The Ministry of Culture offered to finance...

161
00:08:13,078 --> 00:08:14,539
...one more of his expeditions.

162
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,302
Because this time he said he was onto something big.

163
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,385
He was always onto something big.

164
00:08:26,748 --> 00:08:27,068
But...

165
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,590
...bandits raided his camp and, um...

166
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,445
Local authorities found him weeks later.

167
00:08:35,465 --> 00:08:41,169
And this stupid thing is all I have left of him.

168
00:08:45,613 --> 00:08:46,153
I'm sorry.

169
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:48,675
Oh, hey.

170
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:52,338
He certainly made his choice.

171
00:08:57,623 --> 00:08:57,843
So...

172
00:08:57,863 --> 00:09:00,205
Listen, Fraser.

173
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:02,846
You don't think?

174
00:09:03,346 --> 00:09:03,966
It's a doing.

175
00:09:04,406 --> 00:09:05,186
Charging, I think.

176
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:06,327
Tell it to stop!

177
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:07,947
Because I speak elephant!

178
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:09,267
Look at it.

179
00:09:09,327 --> 00:09:13,928
Come on.

180
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:34,673
No wonder she was so distressed.

181
00:09:37,575 --> 00:09:39,276
Hey, about the whole... Sam...

182
00:09:39,636 --> 00:09:40,317
Look, I got it.

183
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:41,277
Alright?

184
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,039
I've got my own shit to sort out as well.

185
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:49,082
Let's not have that stand in the way anymore, eh?

186
00:09:51,704 --> 00:09:54,806
Okay.

187
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:55,186
Deal.

188
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:57,307
Come on.

189
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:01,010
Well, if we accomplished nothing else today...

190
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:03,534
At least we reunited a family.

191
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:05,575
Just keep your distance.

192
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:07,855
We've got a car for them.

193
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:08,175
Right.

194
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:14,357
That bull will kill you.

195
00:10:14,457 --> 00:10:18,599
I suppose it would be a shame to come all this way and die right now here.

196
00:10:27,742 --> 00:10:29,342
Here, I'll take this one.

197
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:29,942
Okay, thanks.

198
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:34,033
Move over a little.

199
00:10:34,693 --> 00:10:35,054
That's good.

200
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:38,136
Now, reach that way and hold out your hand.

201
00:10:38,837 --> 00:10:39,117
What?

202
00:10:41,619 --> 00:10:43,000
Much safer way to pet an elephant.

203
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:44,841
Much obliged.

204
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,172
It was in this level where the elephants were originally.

205
00:10:58,672 --> 00:11:01,114
It's one of our biggest and most open world levels

206
00:11:01,254 --> 00:11:02,275
we've ever created.

207
00:11:02,902 --> 00:11:05,143
It's a jungle in Western Ghats, India.

208
00:11:08,105 --> 00:11:09,986
We created a space where exploration

209
00:11:10,107 --> 00:11:12,648
and interactive scenes could take place in any order.

210
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:14,690
And in an earlier version of this level,

211
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,652
this included stumbling upon an elephant pond,

212
00:11:18,092 --> 00:11:19,373
which was visible in the distance,

213
00:11:19,453 --> 00:11:20,994
but not reachable by the player.

214
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,217
The elephants were supposed to be a background element,

215
00:11:26,037 --> 00:11:27,458
animals in a jungle.

216
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:29,500
In the far distance,

217
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,982
they're underneath the trees in the middle.

218
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:35,401
We were never supposed to ever even get close to them.

219
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:40,122
And that space became this space up in the pond.

220
00:11:40,582 --> 00:11:45,703
As we started playtesting it, people kept wanting to get closer and closer to the elephants.

221
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:51,584
So once we playtested the space, being clear that the player wanted to reach the elephant

222
00:11:51,604 --> 00:11:51,884
pond.

223
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:02,066
So design afforded the players a chance to observe the elephants up close.

224
00:12:12,057 --> 00:12:13,438
I've never tried this at home.

225
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,122
Once the player was allowed to get near the elephants, they wanted to pet them and feed

226
00:12:26,182 --> 00:12:27,562
them and ride them.

227
00:12:28,563 --> 00:12:32,524
So while we began exploring this idea, we lost our sense of being grounded.

228
00:12:35,191 --> 00:12:39,252
This is a car in the aftermath of an elephant attack.

229
00:12:40,152 --> 00:12:41,593
Elephants are not docile.

230
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:44,613
So most people who approach a herd of elephants,

231
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:47,794
let alone try and pet their calf, wouldn't come out alive.

232
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,355
Our game director, Kurt Margenau,

233
00:12:51,495 --> 00:12:55,276
tweeted, this sequence exists because Amadina Soria was

234
00:12:55,296 --> 00:12:57,977
doing a test and put Chloe on an elephant as a joke.

235
00:12:58,617 --> 00:12:59,797
Then people wanted it for real.

236
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:01,058
I hated it so much.

237
00:13:01,178 --> 00:13:04,258
My gut was, oh my god, how do we make this not dumb and silly?

238
00:13:05,147 --> 00:13:06,988
After many iterations, we found a way.

239
00:13:07,429 --> 00:13:09,010
Thank you, team, for being persistent.

240
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:14,133
So my lead, Almudena, used our old horse tech

241
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:17,095
from Uncharted 3 to prove that we could actually

242
00:13:17,115 --> 00:13:17,836
ride the elephant.

243
00:13:19,237 --> 00:13:21,198
We called the elephant Horton for a little while,

244
00:13:21,238 --> 00:13:24,660
like Horton, here's a who, because our file name

245
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,941
from Uncharted was Horse 10.

246
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:29,403
And so

247
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,436
Once we allowed the player to ride the elephant,

248
00:13:32,476 --> 00:13:33,617
it seemed like there was no going back

249
00:13:33,657 --> 00:13:34,638
because people really loved it.

250
00:13:34,798 --> 00:13:35,418
It was really fun.

251
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:36,839
I mean, who doesn't want to ride an elephant?

252
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:40,041
So it was at this point in design and story

253
00:13:40,081 --> 00:13:42,702
realized that the elephant needed a more structured

254
00:13:42,962 --> 00:13:44,083
and cohesive moment.

255
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:48,285
So we contacted an animal welfare consultant

256
00:13:48,425 --> 00:13:49,746
and a cultural advisor.

257
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:53,968
And they suggested from the beginning

258
00:13:54,008 --> 00:13:56,530
that we shouldn't be able to just hop on an elephant

259
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:57,890
and ride it wherever we want to.

260
00:13:58,435 --> 00:14:01,536
Because if we did this, that would suggest that the elephant had been trained,

261
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:05,557
and in turn, most likely abused during that process.

262
00:14:06,957 --> 00:14:10,078
So for the player, riding the elephant was fun, but it was really silly.

263
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:13,819
So making this believable was a huge challenge for us.

264
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:18,680
So through collaboration between design and story, we came up with multiple layouts,

265
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:23,341
some I've shown you already, and prototypes and previsits of how we find the elephant

266
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,722
and how we get on it.

267
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:33,274
Once we decided we're going to ride it, this new version of this beat got moved to another level.

268
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:42,798
At this point, the story was more developed and Chloe and Nadine discovered that the antagonist of their story had caused an explosion, which in turn had trapped one elephant.

269
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:47,680
This gave us the justification as to why there was one elephant and why it was trapped.

270
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,722
This is the original block mesh for this new location.

271
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:54,383
There were three design goals that we needed to hit.

272
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:58,945
Unblock the path, rescue the elephant, and ride the elephant.

273
00:14:59,886 --> 00:15:02,388
Their justifications came after many iterations.

274
00:15:02,888 --> 00:15:07,432
So as I mentioned before, one of our biggest challenges was to find a grounded way of riding

275
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:09,373
a wild elephant.

276
00:15:10,594 --> 00:15:16,899
Here the idea was to traverse up and around, which then would cause the collapse of debris,

277
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:18,740
which would open a path for the elephant.

278
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:23,003
But we still didn't know how to get on the elephant at this point.

279
00:15:24,852 --> 00:15:27,274
That version wasn't working, so we cut that layout

280
00:15:27,555 --> 00:15:28,375
and we tried again.

281
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:32,018
And it turned into Chloe and Nadine working together

282
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,920
to release the rebel, which also opened

283
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,081
the path for the elephant.

284
00:15:35,582 --> 00:15:37,203
You help the elephant, and the elephant

285
00:15:37,223 --> 00:15:38,604
helps you get out of the cave.

286
00:15:38,884 --> 00:15:41,166
You can't really see it here, but the elephant

287
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:44,449
is actually kneeling down so that you

288
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:47,272
can climb on the log next to the elephant and get on her.

289
00:15:48,252 --> 00:15:49,594
And she does this because she says,

290
00:15:49,654 --> 00:15:50,955
thank you for clearing the path.

291
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:54,820
pretty flawed.

292
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,041
So this wasn't the correct solution,

293
00:15:57,101 --> 00:15:58,502
but we needed to get on the elephant

294
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:00,924
in order for the game to progress until we figured out

295
00:16:00,944 --> 00:16:01,725
a better solution.

296
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:06,629
In this version, Chloe and Aideen

297
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:11,093
still work together to release the rubble and free the animal.

298
00:16:11,173 --> 00:16:12,934
Same beats, but a different ending.

299
00:16:13,995 --> 00:16:16,597
Still have the challenge and major issue

300
00:16:16,637 --> 00:16:18,058
of how do we get on this elephant

301
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:20,740
and make it seem as grounded as possible.

302
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:24,476
In each version, there were some elements that did work

303
00:16:24,556 --> 00:16:26,978
and that got carried over into the next version,

304
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:30,079
like helping the elephant by moving the rubble.

305
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,441
And this one was slightly different than the previous,

306
00:16:35,843 --> 00:16:36,863
but still very flawed.

307
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,841
The previous layout wasn't working

308
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:52,143
because we couldn't get on the elephant in a grounded way.

309
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:54,684
It got cut and we finally landed on this version.

310
00:16:55,285 --> 00:16:57,426
Basic concept still there, but now the elephant

311
00:16:57,486 --> 00:16:59,547
is physically trapped and Chloe and Nadine

312
00:16:59,588 --> 00:17:04,010
have to help her and work together to free the elephant.

313
00:17:04,671 --> 00:17:06,152
And in return, the elephant helps them

314
00:17:06,232 --> 00:17:07,973
by taking them to their next destination.

315
00:17:13,972 --> 00:17:17,673
Other than the initial story beats of how to ride a wild elephant, there were a lot

316
00:17:17,693 --> 00:17:20,494
of other problems we needed to solve to make this moment work.

317
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:25,195
I remember being in the meeting when riding the elephant was joked about.

318
00:17:25,215 --> 00:17:27,576
I was like, we can't mocap an elephant.

319
00:17:29,057 --> 00:17:31,457
And to make a move set for one is going to take forever.

320
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:32,818
We're on a really tight deadline.

321
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:37,819
There were a lot of hesitation, a lot of hesitation from a lot of people, but in the end, we got

322
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,740
a lot of support from our leads.

323
00:17:44,674 --> 00:17:49,497
Our standard player camera didn't work once we were riding an elephant,

324
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:55,780
and two characters were attached to her. The first few rounds had the camera either too far

325
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:00,703
away from the characters or clipping through the elephant's butt. Here the camera is clipping

326
00:18:00,723 --> 00:18:07,567
through the head and the butt, and characters are not in an optimal position. So our design

327
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:11,509
scripter for this part took two different player cameras that would blend in and out of a custom

328
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:14,251
spline depending on where you were relative to the elephant.

329
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,010
If you were in the front of the elephant,

330
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:19,412
we wanted to make sure that we framed her face very well.

331
00:18:19,552 --> 00:18:20,372
And if we were in the back,

332
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,653
we wanted to avoid colliding with her butt.

333
00:18:22,794 --> 00:18:23,734
And if we were on the side,

334
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:25,955
we wanted to frame Chloe and Nadine nicely.

335
00:18:29,657 --> 00:18:32,138
In the beginning, the player sort of drove the elephant

336
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:33,399
and had total control.

337
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:38,101
So we experimented with allowing the player

338
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:40,802
to drive the elephant.

339
00:18:41,422 --> 00:18:42,403
And then it made it seem like

340
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:46,895
The player was riding a horse or a horten.

341
00:18:46,915 --> 00:18:50,677
So we wanted more control over what moments we forced

342
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:51,578
the player to look at.

343
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:54,119
And we lost that control when we gave more control

344
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:54,619
to the player.

345
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,403
So eventually, full player control of the elephant

346
00:19:00,503 --> 00:19:01,023
got cut.

347
00:19:01,344 --> 00:19:03,345
And in the final version, there's minimal control.

348
00:19:03,645 --> 00:19:05,947
For instance, if the path split, like.

349
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,096
One went to the right of that rock

350
00:19:08,156 --> 00:19:09,676
and one went to the left of that rock.

351
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:10,577
We had two splines.

352
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:11,837
You could choose which one to go on,

353
00:19:11,857 --> 00:19:13,818
but that was pretty much the only choice you had.

354
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:19,660
So once we got the elephant on a spline,

355
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,741
getting her to move on the spline,

356
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:25,322
similar to a ride car, fluidly, was also difficult.

357
00:19:25,522 --> 00:19:27,402
It was pretty clunky because the elephant

358
00:19:27,442 --> 00:19:29,163
was reacting to the background collision

359
00:19:29,283 --> 00:19:30,984
over this very rough terrain.

360
00:19:31,524 --> 00:19:33,765
So eventually, the collision was flattened out and smoothed out,

361
00:19:34,385 --> 00:19:35,485
and the background geo was not.

362
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:40,768
Monkeys, rocket launchers, and rifles were problems.

363
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:44,149
So transitioning from the elephant ride

364
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:46,890
into the cut scene on the elephant also proved difficult.

365
00:19:47,351 --> 00:19:48,811
The monkey moment doesn't last too long,

366
00:19:48,871 --> 00:19:50,552
but it took a really long time to figure out

367
00:19:51,432 --> 00:19:54,133
what that transition would be into the cut scene.

368
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,274
Background needed to be adjusted for this section of the ride

369
00:19:57,294 --> 00:19:59,795
so we could see a nice silhouette of the tree

370
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:01,235
and the monkeys climbing it.

371
00:20:02,177 --> 00:20:04,197
And the idea started, we didn't have the background

372
00:20:04,217 --> 00:20:05,758
to support this, and the idea started where

373
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:07,559
there was a rock in the middle of the path

374
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,760
and I just started placing foreground branches everywhere.

375
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,760
I was like, oh, the monkeys could go up here, I guess.

376
00:20:11,841 --> 00:20:14,942
And then that translated into the background

377
00:20:15,062 --> 00:20:17,863
creating the elements that we needed

378
00:20:20,444 --> 00:20:22,105
for where the monkeys ended up climbing.

379
00:20:22,885 --> 00:20:25,846
We needed a way to guide the player's eyes up

380
00:20:26,786 --> 00:20:31,708
so that would motivate the cut for the cut scene.

381
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:34,971
So we had to constrain the camera at the end of player control

382
00:20:35,011 --> 00:20:36,612
so that it was facing the right direction

383
00:20:36,712 --> 00:20:38,113
for the first shot of the cinematic.

384
00:20:43,396 --> 00:20:45,537
This transition started with leaves falling,

385
00:20:45,637 --> 00:20:47,679
which helped to guide the player's eyes up.

386
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,461
And then we slowly started to constrain the camera

387
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:51,821
to look up at the monkeys.

388
00:20:52,362 --> 00:20:54,403
And that, like I said, motivated the camera cut.

389
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:00,547
Normal gameplay allows for you to

390
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:05,830
Shoot your weapon.

391
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,972
But you can't have your weapon enabled when you're not an elephant, otherwise everybody

392
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:12,933
would be trying to shoot elephants.

393
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:20,937
I like how they disabled the gun.

394
00:21:22,477 --> 00:21:23,778
They thought of these things.

395
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:29,901
So it was disabled in this section, but that was the first level that the elephants were

396
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:30,081
in.

397
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:32,462
And when it got moved to another level, the scripter changed with it.

398
00:21:32,522 --> 00:21:33,242
And so we had a lot of

399
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:36,379
back and forth, like, oh, where is that in script?

400
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:37,779
Can we turn that off again, please?

401
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,981
So we had to give the player some interactions

402
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:45,981
during this very quiet ride.

403
00:21:46,381 --> 00:21:48,982
You're with a character who doesn't want to talk to you

404
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,163
and you can't get off, you're stuck on this elephant.

405
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,783
So the player could choose to feed the elephant

406
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:56,244
three times if they pleased, or not.

407
00:21:56,464 --> 00:21:58,584
You could grab the branch or you could not grab the branch

408
00:21:58,644 --> 00:22:01,285
and you had three pieces of fruit on this branch

409
00:22:01,325 --> 00:22:03,005
that could be fed to the elephant.

410
00:22:05,316 --> 00:22:05,696
Rifles.

411
00:22:06,537 --> 00:22:08,918
The first shot of the cinematic, we hid Chloe's rifle.

412
00:22:08,938 --> 00:22:11,840
It kept clipping through Chloe's shoulder and the elephant's

413
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,582
back, causing it to be very distracting to have it visible.

414
00:22:14,922 --> 00:22:17,964
But we give it back to you at the end of the sequence

415
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:19,465
once they stand up out of the water.

416
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:25,209
Some actor choices in the cinematic

417
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:26,790
proved visually unappealing.

418
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,650
This cut scene was emotional, and the standalone results

419
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,070
were great.

420
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,991
But once placed on a hairy elephant,

421
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:38,391
it looked like Chloe was resting on a big, hairy butt.

422
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,692
So not very pretty to look at.

423
00:22:42,212 --> 00:22:44,593
So this version was cut, and we reshot it

424
00:22:44,753 --> 00:22:46,953
with given direction to our actor

425
00:22:47,193 --> 00:22:49,154
not to take that position.

426
00:22:52,054 --> 00:22:55,855
How do we land in an elephant pond as fluidly as possible?

427
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,216
Elephants don't jump.

428
00:22:59,694 --> 00:23:05,498
into things. So design, but design needed a way to evolve the player once we were in the pond.

429
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:14,904
And for a really long time this cliff was really high and the pond was really shallow.

430
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:21,148
So it took a while but eventually we made the cliff really low and the pond really deep.

431
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,293
Plus tighter, more cinematic cameras also helped in the final version.

432
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:33,071
What interactions can we have once we're in the pond?

433
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:37,854
You know, people love petting animals, especially baby animals, in life and in games.

434
00:23:38,394 --> 00:23:40,856
And in the beginning, we gave you the option to pet the baby.

435
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:44,778
I could pet this baby elephant. That is so cute.

436
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:50,601
So ultimately, this was too silly and not grounded enough to keep in the game.

437
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:54,264
So, I mean, of course we can allow you to pet a baby elephant.

438
00:23:54,524 --> 00:23:57,826
But is a herd of wild elephants going to let you pet their baby?

439
00:23:57,846 --> 00:23:59,106
I don't think so.

440
00:24:00,184 --> 00:24:02,746
So unfortunately, the baby elephant was not an option,

441
00:24:02,846 --> 00:24:03,826
and that had to get cut.

442
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:05,888
The feedback we kept getting, though,

443
00:24:05,908 --> 00:24:07,809
was that everybody still wanted to pet the elephant.

444
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:11,031
So we added the ability to pet the elephant

445
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:14,733
in the beginning of the sequence while you're riding her.

446
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:20,096
And if you attempted to pet the elephant,

447
00:24:21,957 --> 00:24:23,038
the bull warned you to stay away.

448
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,141
We didn't give many other choices for interacts.

449
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,271
You either attempt to pet the bull.

450
00:24:31,472 --> 00:24:33,334
We also wanted the player to continue on.

451
00:24:33,794 --> 00:24:37,196
So by the time you arrive at the pond, since this beat was essentially over,

452
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:40,699
we wanted you to keep going.

453
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:42,540
But this was the last interaction that we allowed.

454
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,202
It was a picture to be taken, and it's stored on Chloe's phone,

455
00:24:45,242 --> 00:24:46,283
so you can look at it later.

456
00:24:46,723 --> 00:24:48,925
It's a nice keepsake for the end of the moment.

457
00:24:55,025 --> 00:24:58,706
Take time to explore options within design and story.

458
00:24:59,087 --> 00:25:00,887
If you take anything away from this talk,

459
00:25:00,927 --> 00:25:03,469
it doesn't matter how big or small your project may be.

460
00:25:03,829 --> 00:25:06,570
Moments like this take a lot of trial and error.

461
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,251
And test them and get feedback.

462
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,933
Add to them, and then make them the best moments possible.

463
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:19,676
And if something isn't working, try it again in a different way.

464
00:25:19,896 --> 00:25:21,197
And try it again in another way.

465
00:25:21,217 --> 00:25:23,758
And if it still isn't working, then just cut it and move on.

466
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:29,424
A cute, whimsical, or silly idea like riding a wild elephant

467
00:25:29,664 --> 00:25:31,565
might get easily dismissed before it's tried.

468
00:25:32,205 --> 00:25:34,606
So we continued to try a lot of different versions

469
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:36,527
and had different ideas of how we

470
00:25:36,547 --> 00:25:39,008
could make this elephant a bigger part of this game,

471
00:25:39,508 --> 00:25:41,869
mostly because people really liked the idea,

472
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:43,509
and it was fun, and it was different.

473
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,510
It was also a fun challenge to solve.

474
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,971
With each version, we got closer and closer.

475
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:51,932
We were never supposed to even get close to these elephants.

476
00:25:52,352 --> 00:25:55,013
They were supposed to be a background animal.

477
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,021
So you just saw the development process of how this background

478
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:02,204
beat became a quiet, peaceful moment in a high-paced action

479
00:26:02,264 --> 00:26:02,864
adventure game.

480
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:07,546
So like this moment, small background beat

481
00:26:07,707 --> 00:26:09,708
always has potential for more development.

482
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,471
Of course, there were many more issues

483
00:26:15,551 --> 00:26:17,112
we encountered during this sequence,

484
00:26:17,192 --> 00:26:18,312
but I only have 30 minutes.

485
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:21,294
And this sequence wouldn't have been possible without everyone

486
00:26:21,314 --> 00:26:22,714
at Naughty Dog who worked on this level.

487
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:25,456
Beyond design, story, and animation.

488
00:26:25,803 --> 00:26:28,384
There's of course our actors, Laura Bailey and Claudia Black,

489
00:26:28,645 --> 00:26:31,767
our stunt actors, our character designers, TDs, audio

490
00:26:31,827 --> 00:26:33,988
engineers, programmers, background artists,

491
00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:37,130
effects artists, production team, QA, focus testers.

492
00:26:37,911 --> 00:26:41,433
Thank you to our creative writer, our creative director,

493
00:26:41,493 --> 00:26:44,535
and our writer, Shauna Sky, co-writer Josh Sher, game

00:26:47,977 --> 00:26:51,499
level designer Michael Barclay, design scripter Felix Park,

496
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,921
and lead animator Almudena Soria.

497
00:26:55,816 --> 00:26:56,659
Thank you very much.

498
00:26:56,859 --> 00:26:58,564
Enjoy the rest of your time at GDC.
