00:00:05,817 --> 00:00:08,438
Hi, I'm Derek Yu, and thanks for watching my talk,

2
00:00:08,438 --> 00:00:13,722
One More Run, The Making of Spelunky 2.

3
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,523
Here's a brief outline of the talk.

4
00:00:15,523 --> 00:00:17,224
We're gonna talk about roguelikes,

5
00:00:17,224 --> 00:00:19,406
why I wanted to make a sequel to Spelunky,

6
00:00:19,406 --> 00:00:21,407
the challenges of making it,

7
00:00:21,407 --> 00:00:24,289
the spiky design of Spelunky,

8
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:25,810
what I was trying to accomplish,

9
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,752
the release, my takeaways,

10
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:30,754
and then at the end, I'll briefly talk about

11
00:00:30,754 --> 00:00:33,395
whether I can imagine more Spelunky in the future,

12
00:00:33,395 --> 00:00:34,917
or if this is it.

13
00:00:37,589 --> 00:00:40,550
All right, to start, let me show you a quick timeline

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,012
of the Spelunky series, which started as a freeware game

15
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,333
I made in Game Maker in 2009.

16
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:50,695
In red are the first releases of each game,

17
00:00:50,695 --> 00:00:54,197
plus the book I wrote about Spelunky's development.

18
00:00:54,197 --> 00:00:57,598
I wanted to make a game that had the complexity and player

19
00:00:57,598 --> 00:01:00,860
agency of a roguelike, but could be accessed as simply

20
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,760
as a platformer.

21
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:04,796
And I was lucky, the concept took off.

22
00:01:04,796 --> 00:01:10,800
Spelunky inspired some awesome games like The Binding of Isaac and FTL,

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,702
and the rest is history.

24
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:17,565
Even in 2021, the genre has showed no signs of slowing down

25
00:01:17,565 --> 00:01:21,728
since there was a release of Returnal earlier this year,

26
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:24,310
as well as a big expansion to Binding of Isaac.

27
00:01:26,981 --> 00:01:32,583
So why did Roguelikes take off, and why are they still so popular?

28
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:37,444
I think the most obvious reason is that they offer a lot of replayability due to the random

29
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:39,025
level generation.

30
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:42,086
They're fun to play, and they're fun to make.

31
00:01:42,086 --> 00:01:47,548
The results of random level generation can be as surprising for the developer as they

32
00:01:47,548 --> 00:01:49,749
are for players.

33
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:54,050
And they offer great streaming and YouTube content.

34
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,231
So that seems simple enough, right?

35
00:01:57,252 --> 00:02:00,593
But I think another reason why roguelikes are still going is that they embody a lot

36
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:04,095
of the exciting potential of the future of video games.

37
00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:05,916
It's not just replayability.

38
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:11,679
Replayability is really just a side effect of a bigger concept, which is the exploration

39
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:16,562
of large, detailed, and highly interactive worlds.

40
00:02:16,562 --> 00:02:18,563
Video games are an interactive medium.

41
00:02:18,563 --> 00:02:20,845
That's what separates them from other art forms.

42
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:25,968
So randomness offers replayability, sure.

43
00:02:25,968 --> 00:02:29,349
That's the basic idea behind slot machines, for example.

44
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,710
But in roguelikes, I think it adds much more.

45
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,811
It's a way to make an infinitely large world

46
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:41,133
within the context of traditional run-based gameplay.

47
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:44,814
Even if an individual run plays more like a retro title,

48
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:52,596
across many, many runs, the structure starts to feel more like an open world game. That's why

49
00:02:52,596 --> 00:02:58,342
the traditional turn-based roguelikes have remained such a strong niche, despite the ASCII

50
00:02:58,342 --> 00:03:05,149
graphics and obtuse interfaces. And that's why modern roguelikes exploded once those graphical

51
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:07,011
and UI barriers were removed.

52
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:12,484
Finally, I think roguelikes are so popular because it's a flexible framework

53
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:16,286
that happened to be tied to a very specific type of game in the past.

54
00:03:16,286 --> 00:03:20,888
The Berlin interpretation created for classic roguelikes is just that.

55
00:03:20,888 --> 00:03:22,048
It's an interpretation.

56
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:25,770
There are high-value factors and low-value factors,

57
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,350
but it's not super strict.

58
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,731
It's not even canon.

59
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:33,353
Classic roguelike devs have been arguing about this stuff

60
00:03:33,353 --> 00:03:35,614
long before the modern roguelike came along.

61
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:43,105
These factors are, in effect, ingredients that you can sprinkle onto your game

62
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:45,267
to make it more or less roguelike.

63
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,889
What Spelunky did was simply show clearly

64
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:51,933
that a lot of what was interesting about roguelikes

65
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:55,015
were not actually tied to the turn-based dungeon crawl.

66
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:57,938
It definitely wasn't the first action roguelike,

67
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:02,402
but it made it clear how flexible these roguelike qualities really were.

68
00:04:03,024 --> 00:04:07,588
And I've said this before, but I think roguelike is similar to RPG in that sense.

69
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:12,912
Any game can have RPG elements and any game can have some roguelike elements.

70
00:04:12,912 --> 00:04:20,218
And that flexibility is a big reason why it's really just a powerful collection of ideas.

71
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,840
So that's why roguelikes are still so popular.

72
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,802
Why make a sequel to Spelunky, though?

73
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:28,898
Well, I had a few reasons, as you can see here.

74
00:04:28,898 --> 00:04:31,339
The first reason I wanted to make another Spelunky game was,

75
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:33,761
I felt like it still had more potential.

76
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:37,983
When I made Spelunky Classic, it took most of my focus

77
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:39,744
just to bring these two ideas together,

78
00:04:39,744 --> 00:04:42,766
roguelikes and platformers.

79
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:45,768
There wasn't a blueprint for that type of game yet.

80
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,901
when I started working on it.

81
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:49,942
And I was also learning GameMaker

82
00:04:49,942 --> 00:04:52,643
and doing my own programming for the first time in years.

83
00:04:52,643 --> 00:04:54,064
So there was just a lot to learn.

84
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:56,165
But once Spelunky Classic was done,

85
00:04:56,165 --> 00:04:58,846
it became the blueprint for Spelunky 1.

86
00:04:58,846 --> 00:05:05,309
And with the help of Andy Hull, Eric Serka, and Microsoft,

87
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:07,330
we were able to do a lot more to get closer

88
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:13,192
to the edges of the possibility space of this world

89
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:14,253
and these systems.

90
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:20,664
It also felt like we were getting closer to the soul of Spelunky, with Spelunky 1, and

91
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:25,589
I wanted to take another step in that direction.

92
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:31,495
If you think about how, you know, Mario started with Donkey Kong and how each new game in

93
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:36,720
the series moved it closer to where it is now with new characters, new mechanics, more

94
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,803
polish, that's kind of what I wanted to do with Spelunky.

95
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:46,237
So if Spelunky Classic was Donkey Kong and Spelunky 1 was like Super Mario Bros.,

96
00:05:46,237 --> 00:05:51,322
then, you know, essentially I wanted to make the equivalent of a Super Mario World.

97
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:58,287
Reason number two as to why I want to make a sequel. As I said before,

98
00:05:58,287 --> 00:06:01,910
roguelike is a flexible framework and after Spelunky, new roguelike games

99
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,333
moved in different directions really quickly.

100
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,836
Which is, you know, I think is awesome. It just makes the genre

101
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,501
just feel very diverse and interesting.

102
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:15,443
For example, The Binding of Isaac is a top-down shooter.

103
00:06:15,443 --> 00:06:19,445
FTL is a real-time tactics game set in space.

104
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,286
Eventually, Slay the Spire would incorporate

105
00:06:22,286 --> 00:06:25,408
roguelike elements into a deck-building game,

106
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:28,049
creating another new subgenre.

107
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:30,710
So it was a really wild, like,

108
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:34,352
explosion in every direction after Spelunky.

109
00:06:35,234 --> 00:06:40,825
And years after Spelunky was released, roguelikes are still, I think, really popular.

110
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:46,777
But I still felt like Spelunky was a relatively unique game.

111
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:49,886
compared to all the other roguelikes.

112
00:06:49,886 --> 00:06:52,467
And I think the main thing that makes Spelunky unique to me

113
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:54,868
is the way that it combines the simplicity

114
00:06:54,868 --> 00:06:56,608
of playing an action arcade game

115
00:06:56,608 --> 00:06:59,129
with what I like to call high interactivity.

116
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:01,970
So what is high interactivity?

117
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:07,112
I think it's a combination of low-level similarities.

118
00:07:07,112 --> 00:07:08,532
In the Berlin interpretation,

119
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:11,453
they call this monsters are similar to players,

120
00:07:11,453 --> 00:07:12,994
and they call it a low value factor,

121
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:15,614
but for me, it's one of the highest value factors

122
00:07:15,614 --> 00:07:17,935
that was really ahead of its time.

123
00:07:19,055 --> 00:07:21,636
And then there's destructible terrain.

124
00:07:21,636 --> 00:07:24,438
It's rare to play games that have fully destructible terrain,

125
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:26,360
but it's one of my favorite elements

126
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,820
in any game that has it.

127
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,181
I think there's a ton of potential

128
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:31,963
in destructible terrain for the future

129
00:07:31,963 --> 00:07:33,564
because it's realistic

130
00:07:33,564 --> 00:07:37,427
and because it also leads to creative solutions,

131
00:07:37,427 --> 00:07:39,708
which to me are always more compelling

132
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:43,131
than singular designer-invented solutions.

133
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:47,453
And then finally, surprising combinations.

134
00:07:48,015 --> 00:07:55,539
like the Rube Goldberg-esque deaths in Spelunky that always feel kind of comically tragic.

135
00:07:55,539 --> 00:08:01,281
So high interactivity was one of those ideas from Roguelikes that I was personally most excited to

136
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:07,264
bring over to platformers. To be able to access even a fraction of, say, NetHack's interactive

137
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:12,787
complexity through the simple controls and fast-paced action of a platformer, to me that

138
00:08:12,787 --> 00:08:13,587
was so exciting.

139
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:25,253
I didn't feel like a lot of roguelikes really leaned into it in exactly the same way that

140
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:27,794
Spelunky did, which I think is fine.

141
00:08:27,794 --> 00:08:30,015
They explored other cool ideas.

142
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:35,177
But if other developers had made games that did what Spelunky did but better, I'd say,

143
00:08:35,177 --> 00:08:37,018
all right, great work.

144
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:38,738
I'm going to move on to something else.

145
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:42,833
So in the end, for me, it came down to potential,

146
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,875
the potential of roguelikes as a framework

147
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:49,879
and the potential of Spelunky as another kind of framework.

148
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:53,702
But the question was, how do we realize that potential?

149
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:57,465
To make Spelunky 1, Andy, Eric, and I pretty much

150
00:08:57,465 --> 00:09:00,487
maxed out what we could do in a few years,

151
00:09:00,487 --> 00:09:02,388
even with Microsoft support.

152
00:09:02,388 --> 00:09:06,011
And besides, Andy was busy with his new project, Dunklord,

153
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:08,933
so he wouldn't be around to work on the sequel.

154
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:13,938
Which brings us to reason number three,

155
00:09:13,938 --> 00:09:17,299
why I wanted to make Spelunky 2, which is the right team.

156
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:20,921
I just wanted, just wanting to make something rather,

157
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:25,563
isn't enough to make it worth making, in my opinion,

158
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:28,684
from like a practical point of view,

159
00:09:28,684 --> 00:09:31,125
in terms of commercial game development,

160
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:33,066
especially if it's a project as big

161
00:09:33,066 --> 00:09:34,787
and personal as Spelunky 2.

162
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:37,568
And a lot of the new features that I wanted to add

163
00:09:37,568 --> 00:09:38,948
were technically challenging,

164
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:41,510
like online multiplayer and fluid dynamics.

165
00:09:42,905 --> 00:09:47,746
Thankfully, Bluetworks really seemed like the perfect studio

166
00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:48,906
to partner with.

167
00:09:48,906 --> 00:09:50,866
We were introduced to them by Sony in 2013

168
00:09:50,866 --> 00:09:53,147
to help us port Spelunky 1 to PlayStation.

169
00:09:53,147 --> 00:09:55,247
It was a great experience.

170
00:09:55,247 --> 00:09:58,748
They definitely had the engineering experience,

171
00:09:58,748 --> 00:10:00,989
and just as importantly, it was clear

172
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:02,849
that we worked together well.

173
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:06,010
They were also one of the few groups of people that

174
00:10:07,305 --> 00:10:13,190
By the time I wanted to make Spelunky 2, they understood how Spelunky worked and how it

175
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:15,731
was put together as well as me and Andy.

176
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:21,996
On the audio side, I asked Eric if he'd be interested in working on Spelunky 2, and he

177
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,978
was, so we ended up with a great team to make Spelunky 2.

178
00:10:26,688 --> 00:10:32,171
And of course, we all missed Andy and would have loved to work with him again, but he was working

179
00:10:32,171 --> 00:10:37,114
on something cool too at the time. And we definitely kept in touch during development.

180
00:10:37,114 --> 00:10:43,018
Actually, it was Andy who suggested adding the back layer to Spelunky 2, which really

181
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:47,361
gave the level design an extra dimension. But we'll get to that later in the talk.

182
00:10:49,628 --> 00:10:53,331
And finally, reason number four why I wanted to make Spelunky 2.

183
00:10:53,331 --> 00:11:00,637
It may seem strange now, but back then there weren't a lot of indie sequels being made.

184
00:11:00,637 --> 00:11:06,601
It felt like every time an indie game developer had a hit on their hands, they were just totally

185
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:10,264
burnt out on the idea afterwards and wanted to try something completely different.

186
00:11:10,264 --> 00:11:16,549
So part of me wanted to make a sequel just to, you know, be a little different and also

187
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:18,230
to challenge myself and see what it was like.

188
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,932
which as an artist is always a fair enough reason to do something, I think.

189
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:31,577
So here's the core development team with the two Derricks, me and Derrick Liu, our trailer maker

190
00:11:31,577 --> 00:11:39,421
in the U.S., Justin Chan, our illustrator in Canada, Blit, and our testing team at Lollipop

191
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:45,964
Robot in Spain, and Eric in Norway. Once the team was assembled, the project moved very quickly.

192
00:11:46,892 --> 00:11:49,174
Since Blitworks had the code for the original game,

193
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:51,535
they started by essentially rebuilding

194
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:54,818
a skeletal version of Spelunky with new code that

195
00:11:54,818 --> 00:11:57,781
would enable online multiplayer and other features

196
00:11:57,781 --> 00:12:00,463
we might need, including debugging tools

197
00:12:00,463 --> 00:12:02,064
that the original game never had.

198
00:12:02,064 --> 00:12:07,389
With Spelunky 1, Andy was always lamenting our lack of tools,

199
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:09,130
partly because tools are fun to make,

200
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,592
and I think he really wanted to make them.

201
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:15,015
But I got pretty comfortable with our janky process.

202
00:12:16,072 --> 00:12:20,313
of making Spelunky 1, and I was also worried about going down a rabbit hole of tool building

203
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:23,654
that would delay the game even further.

204
00:12:23,654 --> 00:12:29,375
Because not only do the tools take time to write, but a lot of times the scope of the

205
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:35,697
game increases to match them, erasing any games that you might have, that you might

206
00:12:35,697 --> 00:12:36,777
get from having the tools.

207
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:41,984
And we were already a bit in over our heads learning how to make our first Xbox game.

208
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:44,526
So I felt like we should just push forward.

209
00:12:44,526 --> 00:12:48,769
For Spocky 2, though, we had a bigger team and bigger plans.

210
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:51,752
And I think we were a bit better prepared.

211
00:12:51,752 --> 00:12:54,294
So good tools made more sense to me.

212
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:59,497
And the communication was also going to be more asynchronous and more complex,

213
00:12:59,497 --> 00:13:06,162
given the time zone differences and the complexity of the game.

214
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:06,323
So.

215
00:13:07,122 --> 00:13:13,766
Blit ended up building, among other things, ways to set all the different variables in the game.

216
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:19,030
You know, you could create whatever you wanted at whatever time to test different scenarios.

217
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:24,214
You could record replays, slow the game down, zoom in and out, pan the camera, etc.

218
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:30,341
Aside from allowing us to test all the different scenarios that might come up,

219
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:36,426
these tools also made it much easier to grab screenshots and take footage for marketing, which

220
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:39,849
definitely can't be discounted and takes a lot of time.

221
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:42,431
For level design, we didn't actually have an in-game editor.

222
00:13:43,248 --> 00:13:45,329
But Blit did externalize the levels

223
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:47,671
so that I could edit them in a text editor

224
00:13:47,671 --> 00:13:51,173
and use all kinds of flags to make my life easier.

225
00:13:51,173 --> 00:13:52,854
And at this point, I'm not actually sure

226
00:13:52,854 --> 00:13:55,036
if a real editor would even be faster for me

227
00:13:55,036 --> 00:13:58,258
because I'm so used to doing things that way.

228
00:13:58,258 --> 00:14:02,521
From there, we more or less executed on the design

229
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:04,583
that I had in mind from the beginning.

230
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:09,405
I used Google Docs to write a design document for the game,

231
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:13,548
and that expanded to be a kind of roadmap for the development

232
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:15,189
as time went on.

233
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:19,212
We primarily use Slack and the comment feature in Docs

234
00:14:19,212 --> 00:14:22,295
to communicate with occasional video chats

235
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,877
to talk through particularly difficult problems.

236
00:14:24,877 --> 00:14:28,820
In any game project, there's going

237
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,642
to be some amount of exploration of ideas,

238
00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:31,742
but.

239
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,647
And, you know, Spelunky 2 is no different in that regard, but I'd say that this was

240
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:42,518
mostly a project of execution compared to Spelunky Classic or even Spelunky 1.

241
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:46,776
Which isn't to say that we didn't have anything to figure out.

242
00:14:46,776 --> 00:14:48,258
There was plenty of that.

243
00:14:48,258 --> 00:14:52,061
So much that it'd be impossible for me to cover it all in this talk.

244
00:14:52,061 --> 00:14:57,046
But the unknowns were relegated more to the details, I would say,

245
00:14:57,046 --> 00:14:58,848
than the core ideas.

246
00:14:58,848 --> 00:15:01,050
We had the previous Spelunky games to look at,

247
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,873
and the places where we wanted to make improvements

248
00:15:03,873 --> 00:15:08,097
were relatively obvious compared to the previous two games.

249
00:15:09,892 --> 00:15:12,733
The biggest challenges I'd say that we faced during development

250
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:14,974
were these.

251
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:16,595
All of these were things that we worked on

252
00:15:16,595 --> 00:15:18,756
throughout the entire development

253
00:15:18,756 --> 00:15:23,679
and only came together toward the very end.

254
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,060
So first of all, the art style.

255
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:29,642
I had a pretty good general idea of what direction

256
00:15:29,642 --> 00:15:32,083
I wanted to go with the art style.

257
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:37,186
Spelunky had a look that was both cartoony and detailed.

258
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:41,392
which match the arcade meets roguelike mechanics really well.

259
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:46,276
But the detail, you know, I added the detail without a real plan.

260
00:15:47,535 --> 00:15:53,597
And I also had to repurpose a lot of the environmental art because of lack of time.

261
00:15:53,597 --> 00:15:59,158
So as a result, every area has this kind of rocky, crunchy granola look to it, you know,

262
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:03,779
which I think is pretty cool actually. But for two, I wanted the detail to

263
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:06,460
pop more in some parts and recede in other parts.

264
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,661
I wanted there to be, I wanted it to be more of a conscious decision.

265
00:16:12,093 --> 00:16:16,917
And I also wanted each area of the game to have its own visual personality with distinct

266
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:18,739
color schemes and patterns.

267
00:16:18,739 --> 00:16:22,723
I wanted each area to really stand out on its own.

268
00:16:22,723 --> 00:16:31,691
And I was inspired a lot by retro platformers that have the like wallpapered floor, you

269
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:34,534
know, as far as, as far as that design went.

270
00:16:35,312 --> 00:16:41,374
But it was a lot of extra work, and it took time to find a good balance between easy to read

271
00:16:41,374 --> 00:16:46,295
and interesting to look at. I started with something more on the cartoony side of the

272
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:51,157
spectrum, but over time I pulled it back to something that was closer to Spelunky 1.

273
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:56,539
And quite a few players felt like the graphics in our early game trailers looked flat,

274
00:16:56,539 --> 00:17:00,000
and compared to the final game, it definitely was.

275
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:07,238
But compression of video, especially if you're viewing it in a small window or something like

276
00:17:07,238 --> 00:17:14,501
that, also destroyed a lot of the detail. With trailers, although you always want to give off

277
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:22,304
your best impression, it's also just a really useful time to get feedback because

278
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:31,555
It can be some of the only honest feedback you get from a wider, more general audience

279
00:17:31,555 --> 00:17:32,715
until release, of course.

280
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:37,338
Design-wise, I probably had the hardest time with quests.

281
00:17:38,786 --> 00:17:43,352
I was really excited by the prospect of quests because it was an opportunity to add interesting

282
00:17:43,352 --> 00:17:49,219
new characters to the game and weave some static stories into the emerging ones.

283
00:17:49,219 --> 00:17:54,886
The tricky part though was coming up with enough variety in the quests in a fast-paced

284
00:17:54,886 --> 00:17:57,049
arcade game that doesn't have a lot of text.

285
00:17:58,027 --> 00:18:04,994
In RPG, you can kind of get away with like a dozen similar fetch quests or kill the monster

286
00:18:04,994 --> 00:18:10,260
quests because you can add interest through descriptions and dialogue and things like

287
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,380
that.

288
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:15,036
which we didn't have access to in a game like Spelunky.

289
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:18,877
Ultimately, I tried to tie each quest

290
00:18:18,877 --> 00:18:21,877
to a different system in the game,

291
00:18:21,877 --> 00:18:25,158
like mounts or shops or gambling,

292
00:18:25,158 --> 00:18:26,819
getting in trouble, things like that.

293
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:29,119
But it took quite a bit of work to figure out

294
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,380
exactly how each quest would play out and in what levels.

295
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,020
Also, given Spelunky's design,

296
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,861
it wouldn't have felt right

297
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:38,141
if the quests were just shoved in your face.

298
00:18:38,956 --> 00:18:43,439
They had to be optional and feel well integrated into each level.

299
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:45,481
And that also took time as well.

300
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:50,205
And actually, it's funny, I was taking a screenshot,

301
00:18:50,205 --> 00:18:51,746
this screenshot for this slide.

302
00:18:51,746 --> 00:18:56,970
I wanted to get a screenshot of Yang just giving me

303
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,872
the quest of finding turkeys, but I ended up

304
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:02,935
accidentally knocking a caveman onto Yang

305
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:04,716
and making him angry at me.

306
00:19:04,716 --> 00:19:06,678
And I decided to just roll with it,

307
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:07,358
because that's like.

308
00:19:08,081 --> 00:19:12,006
totally such a Spelunky thing to happen.

309
00:19:12,006 --> 00:19:15,811
Regarding liquids, I really wanted to make them more dynamic in Spelunky 2.

310
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:20,096
In Spelunky 1, liquid could move around but in a very stilted way that still

311
00:19:20,096 --> 00:19:21,057
relied on the grid.

312
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:25,188
In general, the grid, the tile grid,

313
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:28,049
is an important part of Spelunky's movement and level

314
00:19:28,049 --> 00:19:32,091
design that makes it possible, both for me as a designer

315
00:19:32,091 --> 00:19:33,931
and for the player who's playing,

316
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:39,273
to know exactly where you can get to just by counting tiles.

317
00:19:39,273 --> 00:19:43,515
Grids are a very video gamey convention, which actually

318
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,335
I like.

319
00:19:44,335 --> 00:19:47,436
But when there's a nice opportunity to break it up,

320
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,757
I like to take it.

321
00:19:49,816 --> 00:19:56,620
Spelunky for me is a game that is always sort of straddling two different concepts like that at once.

322
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,683
Arcade and roguelike, cartoony and realistic, grid-based and dynamic.

323
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:06,546
From both an artistic and technical perspective, liquids were

324
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:10,208
really tricky to get right. For one thing, they're hard on the CPU.

325
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:14,828
Early on, we decided to limit them to the front layer

326
00:20:14,828 --> 00:20:16,148
of the game for that reason.

327
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:18,049
You can't have liquids in the back layer.

328
00:20:18,049 --> 00:20:21,249
And throughout development, we played around

329
00:20:21,249 --> 00:20:25,970
with the size and shape of each liquid blob

330
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,251
to find a balance between realism and performance.

331
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:33,792
And we especially had to think about online multiplayer

332
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:35,652
in that regard.

333
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:39,253
So it took some experimentation to...

334
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:45,443
get the right balance there and also to make make sure that the look match the rest of the game.

335
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:53,909
And it also took time to just figure out like what we could do with liquids with with this

336
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:59,473
this type of liquid physics and in Spelunky and in the end I think we came up with some cool

337
00:20:59,473 --> 00:21:05,678
ideas like fountains and and the lava mandor who can spray lava on you. But you know there's

338
00:21:05,678 --> 00:21:07,259
probably even more potential there.

339
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:13,601
Then there's online multiplayer, which is always hard,

340
00:21:13,601 --> 00:21:15,042
especially for a small team.

341
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:18,064
I know Guillermo from Blitworks is giving a talk

342
00:21:18,064 --> 00:21:22,588
about the netcode specifically as part of GDC.

343
00:21:22,588 --> 00:21:24,729
So if you're curious about the details of that,

344
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:25,690
please watch his talk.

345
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:29,727
From my understanding, they evaluated the game

346
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:32,548
and felt like a rollback method would best serve our needs,

347
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:37,649
given the size of our team and the game's precise platforming

348
00:21:37,649 --> 00:21:39,710
nature, among other things.

349
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,950
But to make a long story short, Blit

350
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,251
had to balance implementing my request for more complexity

351
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:47,652
in the levels and also implementing the game,

352
00:21:47,652 --> 00:21:50,753
or I'm sorry, also optimizing the game

353
00:21:50,753 --> 00:21:52,913
to make sure that online multiplayer would

354
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:53,573
work in the end.

355
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,244
Although it may not seem like it, Spelunky 2 is a really intensive game,

356
00:21:59,244 --> 00:22:02,927
much more so than a lot of online games.

357
00:22:02,927 --> 00:22:07,431
Like at its very worst, there can be four players running around

358
00:22:07,431 --> 00:22:11,614
and lots of objects moving and colliding in the entire level

359
00:22:11,614 --> 00:22:14,797
across two layers with liquid physics.

360
00:22:14,797 --> 00:22:16,979
And yeah, the

361
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:22,183
a big problem is is also just that.

362
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,064
Right, like all these things happen,

363
00:22:25,064 --> 00:22:28,067
have to be able to happen at once

364
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:32,350
and be updated every frame across the entire level.

365
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,292
So we can't just ignore what's off screen

366
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:36,633
for performance reasons.

367
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:39,936
Unfortunately, even with all this planning and hard work,

368
00:22:39,936 --> 00:22:43,699
the online was pretty rough on release.

369
00:22:43,699 --> 00:22:47,122
So it really goes to show you how tough a problem it is.

370
00:22:47,122 --> 00:22:51,805
And, you know, I'll talk more about release

371
00:22:51,805 --> 00:22:52,406
when I get there.

372
00:22:54,933 --> 00:23:00,336
The final developmental challenge was really just the sheer amount of content there is

373
00:23:00,336 --> 00:23:04,419
in the game, much more than Spelunky 1.

374
00:23:04,419 --> 00:23:08,482
I mean, just the player characters alone, each one has over a hundred frames of animation,

375
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:13,725
including extra animations for things like swimming and holding items that didn't exist

376
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,426
in Spelunky 1.

377
00:23:15,476 --> 00:23:20,299
So about a year before release, I hired Justin Chan to help with illustrations,

378
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:25,443
which was definitely a big step for me because I was used to doing

379
00:23:25,443 --> 00:23:28,185
that artwork myself in all of my previous games.

380
00:23:28,185 --> 00:23:30,967
But he did an awesome job.

381
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:35,310
And I'm honestly not sure how the game would have gone done otherwise.

382
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:40,213
So, you know, a lot of credit to him and also credit to to my wife,

383
00:23:40,213 --> 00:23:44,536
Frances, for for pushing me to get help with art in the first place.

384
00:23:47,916 --> 00:23:52,718
Okay, so this talk is about Spelunky 2, but I need to briefly mention UFO 50,

385
00:23:52,718 --> 00:24:00,722
because for the first part of Spelunky 2's development, I was working on UFO 50 at the

386
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:08,185
same time, which now sounds kind of crazy even to me. But it ended up working out pretty well,

387
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:15,129
I think, because the two projects complemented each other really nicely and scratched different

388
00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:15,989
creative itches.

389
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:25,426
And that picture of Anna right there on the left is by Justin.

390
00:24:25,426 --> 00:24:29,169
So here's a comparison of Spelunky 2 and UFO 50.

391
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:30,450
Spelunky 2 was a sequel.

392
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:33,453
It was an existing idea we were expanding on.

393
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:36,055
The artwork was hand-drawn and very intensive.

394
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:40,980
On the other hand, UFO 50 is 50 completely new retro games

395
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,621
with pixel graphics that I find very breezy and fun to work on

396
00:24:46,621 --> 00:24:49,061
compared to Spelunky 2's hand-drawn art.

397
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:51,722
Of course, the time spent on one project

398
00:24:51,722 --> 00:24:54,703
definitely limited how much time I could spend on the other.

399
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:56,963
But the benefit, which was huge, was

400
00:24:56,963 --> 00:25:01,644
that I always felt very refreshed on both projects.

401
00:25:01,644 --> 00:25:02,484
When I was working.

402
00:25:03,813 --> 00:25:10,658
I was much more focused than I usually was working on just one big project at a time.

403
00:25:10,658 --> 00:25:17,163
From my experience, it can just be really easy to get lost in a single project if that's

404
00:25:17,163 --> 00:25:19,985
all you're thinking about all the time.

405
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:23,367
So even if you're not working on two projects at once, which I don't necessarily recommend,

406
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:27,390
at the very least it's important to take breaks and reset your brain once in a while.

407
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,081
For the most part, I treated UFO 50

408
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:32,303
like a serious hobbyist project,

409
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:35,385
whereas Spelunky 2 is more like my day job.

410
00:25:35,385 --> 00:25:38,027
And at one point, I literally worked on Spelunky 2

411
00:25:38,027 --> 00:25:40,669
during the day and UFO 50 at night,

412
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:44,132
and even used different computers to work on them

413
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:47,114
to help keep them kind of separated in my mind.

414
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:52,178
But there were months where I had to focus on one project

415
00:25:52,178 --> 00:25:54,439
over the other because of a deadline

416
00:25:54,439 --> 00:25:56,581
or a particularly challenging problem.

417
00:25:57,459 --> 00:26:00,300
Eric was also working on both projects,

418
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:05,043
and I'm guessing he had a similar experience as me.

419
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:06,483
Other than me and Eric,

420
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:09,345
UFO 50 had a different team than Spelunky 2,

421
00:26:09,345 --> 00:26:12,846
but we had a really fun time at PAX one year

422
00:26:12,846 --> 00:26:14,767
when both games were being shown

423
00:26:14,767 --> 00:26:16,928
and both teams got to hang out together.

424
00:26:16,928 --> 00:26:23,211
In terms of design,

425
00:26:24,162 --> 00:26:30,064
As I mentioned before, I wanted to preserve the unique qualities of Spelunky 1 compared to other roguelikes,

426
00:26:30,064 --> 00:26:33,785
which are also qualities that I just personally enjoy in games, period.

427
00:26:33,785 --> 00:26:38,987
To sum up, it's a feeling of entering a world that feels like it's not built for you,

428
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:43,948
but offers you a lot of agency as the player to explore it.

429
00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:51,831
It's happy for you when you make progress, but progress isn't the main reason for it existing.

430
00:26:53,587 --> 00:27:00,309
There are consequences to your actions in these worlds, and that makes you really care about what

431
00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:06,151
you're doing. I think that's really important. And, you know, those are the types of games where

432
00:27:06,151 --> 00:27:15,053
I feel the most immersed, irrespective of how good the graphics are or, you know, what the style is.

433
00:27:15,053 --> 00:27:19,595
And I've been thinking about an easy way to talk about this style of game.

434
00:27:20,437 --> 00:27:28,300
and I, that I really like, and I came up with this word spiky, like the spiky sea urchin,

435
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:35,263
that I think works really well for me.

436
00:27:35,263 --> 00:27:42,066
So I think spiky games are often thought of as punishing, but to me the difficulty,

437
00:27:42,066 --> 00:27:45,707
while it's an important part of the design ethos, is...

438
00:27:46,938 --> 00:27:49,780
in service of the goal rather than the goal itself.

439
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,743
The real goal, I think, is to put the player

440
00:27:53,743 --> 00:27:55,824
in a state of focus about the game

441
00:27:55,824 --> 00:27:58,046
and to really care about what they're doing

442
00:27:58,046 --> 00:27:59,227
at any given moment.

443
00:27:59,227 --> 00:28:03,350
It's to make them feel like the world existed

444
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,372
before they arrived and that it will exist

445
00:28:06,372 --> 00:28:10,215
after they leave, to make it feel real.

446
00:28:10,215 --> 00:28:13,517
Winning or finishing the game, in my opinion,

447
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:15,539
is not the main goal of a spiky game.

448
00:28:17,201 --> 00:28:20,082
even if that's ultimately what you're working toward,

449
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:28,866
the opposite of spiky design could be called soft design.

450
00:28:28,866 --> 00:28:31,127
And just to be clear, I think that every game

451
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:36,150
has some soft elements to it and some spiky elements to it.

452
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,070
And there are definitely times where

453
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:47,503
I enjoy spiky design and I feel like playing a... I'm sorry, I enjoy softer design and I'm looking

454
00:28:47,503 --> 00:28:54,026
forward to playing a soft game. For Spelunky 2, I actually wanted to increase the softness

455
00:28:54,026 --> 00:28:57,648
compared to Spelunky 1. I just wanted to make sure that I did it in a way

456
00:28:57,648 --> 00:28:59,729
that it didn't make the game less spiky.

457
00:29:00,484 --> 00:29:07,030
So for example, we expanded the base camp and made that a place where you could relax,

458
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:11,734
practice your moves, and feel a sense of progress as you unlock more of it.

459
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:16,598
At this point, you might be reading these descriptions and thinking,

460
00:29:16,598 --> 00:29:20,761
well, aren't you just talking about casual and hardcore games?

461
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:20,841
Well,

462
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:29,995
Even if there's a significant overlap between soft, spiky and casual hardcore, I feel like

463
00:29:29,995 --> 00:29:36,740
the latter terms are just too loaded and they're too focused on difficulty and certain genres

464
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,681
now.

465
00:29:37,681 --> 00:29:45,146
Difficulty is maybe the easiest way that we have right now to achieve the feeling I'm

466
00:29:45,146 --> 00:29:49,809
talking about, but I wouldn't say it's totally necessary to spiky design.

467
00:29:51,566 --> 00:29:59,034
And actually, you know, I get a lot of spiky feelings from playing Animal Crossing New

468
00:29:59,034 --> 00:30:03,819
Horizons where I feel like some of the user interface designs are purposefully

469
00:30:05,127 --> 00:30:13,351
a little clunky just to try and force the player to or you know encourage the player let's say to

470
00:30:13,351 --> 00:30:20,534
take it slow and treat the island like a place to live rather than a place to min max and optimize

471
00:30:20,534 --> 00:30:28,978
and you know get the biggest house as fast as you can so like you know one example is

472
00:30:28,978 --> 00:30:34,060
the fact that you can't eat a hundred pairs at once right

473
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:41,616
I feel like they may put that in there just so you can more easily enjoy that island life

474
00:30:41,616 --> 00:30:43,778
and relax.

475
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:47,382
Unsurprisingly, not everybody likes spiky games.

476
00:30:47,382 --> 00:30:49,884
It's like bitter or spicy food.

477
00:30:49,884 --> 00:30:54,008
It's an acquired taste that you have to build up.

478
00:30:54,008 --> 00:30:57,752
People who enjoy spicy food really love it, though.

479
00:30:57,752 --> 00:31:00,715
Food that's not spicy can even taste a little bland to them.

480
00:31:02,613 --> 00:31:09,938
It can be hard for people who don't like spicy food to understand why spicy food fans love it so much.

481
00:31:09,938 --> 00:31:18,323
If you're just starting out on your spicy food journey, you can't taste the flavor, just the heat and the pain.

482
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:26,068
Similarly, spiky games generate a lot of enthusiasm from their fans, but for people who aren't there yet, they can just seem hard.

483
00:31:26,068 --> 00:31:27,809
And it doesn't help that...

484
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:34,502
Just like with spicy food, there are people who are just there for the challenge and bragging rights.

485
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:40,285
And there are peppers, hot peppers, and games that are made to cater to those types of people.

486
00:31:40,285 --> 00:31:47,809
Not that there's anything wrong with wanting challenge for the sake of challenge either,

487
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:53,712
but it does make things that much more confusing when people are trying to evaluate spiky games.

488
00:31:54,605 --> 00:31:59,549
Again, for me, the difficulty is only one part of the equation.

489
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:02,471
It's the heat part of spicy food.

490
00:32:02,471 --> 00:32:05,474
I don't eat spicy food to feel pain,

491
00:32:05,474 --> 00:32:07,676
but the pain wakes me up, and it's

492
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:11,199
the gateway to interesting flavors

493
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:13,121
that you can't find anywhere else.

494
00:32:13,121 --> 00:32:16,463
The flavor is what makes spicy food good,

495
00:32:16,463 --> 00:32:20,847
and it gets easier and easier to withstand the heat

496
00:32:20,847 --> 00:32:22,328
the more you experience it.

497
00:32:25,173 --> 00:32:29,676
And the great thing is that there isn't just one spicy dish that you can eat to improve

498
00:32:29,676 --> 00:32:31,998
your spice eating ability.

499
00:32:31,998 --> 00:32:33,819
There are lots of delicious options.

500
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:41,264
Eat one, and you'll make it that much easier to appreciate another.

501
00:32:41,264 --> 00:32:42,465
Same with spiky games.

502
00:32:43,567 --> 00:32:48,590
Learning to enjoy them will open up an entire smorgasbord of great games to enjoy.

503
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:53,834
And if you like these kinds of games and want to make one, it's important to think,

504
00:32:53,834 --> 00:33:05,683
sorry, it's important to understand their flavor and think about what kind of unique flavor that you want to bring to the world.

505
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:10,406
And here's an image showing Spiky and Spicy together.

506
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,303
which is making me really hungry and also want to play some games.

507
00:33:18,303 --> 00:33:23,125
So, all right, back to Spelunky 2 specifically.

508
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:29,449
We've got all these things we've built up across the previous two games.

509
00:33:29,449 --> 00:33:32,210
For me, what I wanted to do with the sequel

510
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:37,833
was just to take that and make it even bigger and feel even more alive.

511
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:46,615
What are things that we introduced in Spelunky 1 that are cool and can be taken even further

512
00:33:46,615 --> 00:33:57,104
in Spelunky 2? So one thing you can do, for example, is just make things bigger. In Mario,

513
00:33:57,104 --> 00:34:05,390
they started with Bullet Bill and later added Bonsai Bill. In Doom 2, they added the Super

514
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,612
Shotgun, which has two barrels.

515
00:34:08,207 --> 00:34:11,589
Well, we can do a similar thing with Spelunky

516
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:15,351
by taking the small crush trap and making

517
00:34:15,351 --> 00:34:17,171
a bigger version of that.

518
00:34:17,171 --> 00:34:18,952
And since we had a chain in Spelunky 1

519
00:34:18,952 --> 00:34:21,514
where you collect special items to get to hell,

520
00:34:21,514 --> 00:34:25,916
let's make that secret route even longer and crazier

521
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:27,957
and weave it into a branching path system.

522
00:34:27,957 --> 00:34:30,918
Some of the joy of sequels for me

523
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:34,920
is just seeing things taken to their logically extreme

524
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,620
conclusion.

525
00:34:36,494 --> 00:34:39,755
We have that freedom to do that because no matter

526
00:34:39,755 --> 00:34:42,676
what the original game is, we'll always exist unchanged.

527
00:34:42,676 --> 00:34:46,237
And that gives us the opportunity

528
00:34:46,237 --> 00:34:50,659
to just explore the possibility space however we want.

529
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:56,641
There are a lot of other little things

530
00:34:56,641 --> 00:35:00,222
that I could talk about, like having the cavemen pick up

531
00:35:00,222 --> 00:35:02,723
items and talk to each other, for example,

532
00:35:02,723 --> 00:35:05,003
was added pretty late in development.

533
00:35:06,228 --> 00:35:09,050
And I think that for how much work that it involved,

534
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,892
it added so much personality to the game

535
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:15,214
and does so much to make the world feel alive

536
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:16,115
and interactive.

537
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:18,156
But it's the kind of thing that's

538
00:35:18,156 --> 00:35:20,798
hard to think about until you have enough of the game's

539
00:35:20,798 --> 00:35:21,939
foundation built.

540
00:35:21,939 --> 00:35:28,123
I will talk a little bit about the level generation, though,

541
00:35:28,123 --> 00:35:28,804
since.

542
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:32,722
we did make some interesting changes to the basic algorithm

543
00:35:32,722 --> 00:35:36,064
to accommodate new features like the back layer

544
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:39,725
and also to make levels feel a little more natural.

545
00:35:39,725 --> 00:35:43,767
The way Spelunky 1's level generation worked

546
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:48,189
is that we take a typical level of 4 by 4 rooms

547
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:53,351
and we generate a path from the top to the bottom,

548
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:57,473
marking each room as a certain type, like entrance.

549
00:35:58,603 --> 00:36:02,085
exit, normal, drop, side room, et cetera.

550
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:05,227
Then we generate all the rooms based

551
00:36:05,227 --> 00:36:07,188
on what they got marked as.

552
00:36:07,188 --> 00:36:09,710
Of course, it's more complicated than that,

553
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,971
especially since there are special rooms like shops

554
00:36:11,971 --> 00:36:12,832
and altars.

555
00:36:12,832 --> 00:36:14,533
But that's the gist of it.

556
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:18,115
The biggest change to the level generation

557
00:36:18,115 --> 00:36:21,396
was the addition of the back layer in Spelunky 2.

558
00:36:21,396 --> 00:36:25,739
This happens after the front layer path is generated.

559
00:36:26,795 --> 00:36:29,396
and the rooms are turned into strings,

560
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:33,618
but before they're actually turned into tiles.

561
00:36:33,618 --> 00:36:36,760
And the reason we need to do it after we generate

562
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,781
the path and the strings is that we

563
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:42,042
need to know the exact structure of the front layer

564
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:45,744
so that we can connect it to the back layer through doors.

565
00:36:45,744 --> 00:36:49,525
Then after generating all of the back layer rooms,

566
00:36:49,525 --> 00:36:50,406
we connect them.

567
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:58,802
with special passageway rooms and shops and treasure caches can also be generated there as well.

568
00:37:02,243 --> 00:37:06,046
There are also backlit rooms that always appear

569
00:37:06,046 --> 00:37:09,968
in specific levels and specific configurations,

570
00:37:09,968 --> 00:37:13,590
like Madame Tusk's Palace of Pleasure.

571
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:16,772
And so we added special dual rooms

572
00:37:16,772 --> 00:37:20,374
where I could define the front of the room

573
00:37:20,374 --> 00:37:23,376
and the back of the room together.

574
00:37:23,376 --> 00:37:26,778
And this is just a drawing that I made to send a bullet

575
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:31,021
to show them what Madame Tusk's Palace of Pleasure

576
00:37:31,021 --> 00:37:32,022
is supposed to look like.

577
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,941
The other major addition to the level generation

578
00:37:36,941 --> 00:37:42,642
are machines, which are inspired by the machines

579
00:37:42,642 --> 00:37:45,303
from the classic roguelike Brogue.

580
00:37:45,303 --> 00:37:48,904
So they're called machines, but they're not

581
00:37:48,904 --> 00:37:51,544
like actual machines, like robots

582
00:37:51,544 --> 00:37:53,425
that you encounter in the game.

583
00:37:53,425 --> 00:38:00,086
In Brogue, machines are just a special generation.

584
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:07,859
a special part of the generation that is used to add interest to dungeons

585
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:13,962
after the basic room generation, and they might include special treasure rooms or

586
00:38:13,962 --> 00:38:17,544
swamps or chasms with bridges across them, stuff like that.

587
00:38:17,544 --> 00:38:22,426
Some of them are just for flavor. In Spelunky, I realized that once we had the

588
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:26,288
path set, we could create rooms that were extra

589
00:38:26,288 --> 00:38:27,709
wide or extra tall.

590
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:32,624
And these machines were used in conjunction with the back layer

591
00:38:32,624 --> 00:38:36,206
to really open up what was possible with Spelunky's

592
00:38:36,206 --> 00:38:37,147
level generation.

593
00:38:37,147 --> 00:38:41,410
So they weren't used in exactly the same way as Brogue,

594
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:46,414
but it was the fact that Brogue added this kind of extra step

595
00:38:46,414 --> 00:38:49,797
in its level generation did inspire me.

596
00:38:49,797 --> 00:38:53,500
And Brogue, by the way, is a very fun game.

597
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:57,303
And I think it has a great balance of simplicity

598
00:38:58,494 --> 00:39:01,817
of playing and complexity of learning.

599
00:39:01,817 --> 00:39:04,018
And I still think that there's a lot that we can learn

600
00:39:04,018 --> 00:39:06,060
from traditional roguelikes.

601
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:12,404
All right, so now it's time to release the game.

602
00:39:12,404 --> 00:39:15,567
Toward the end of 2019, I spoke with Eric,

603
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:19,890
and it felt like we need to make a decision

604
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,552
to focus on either Spelunky 2 or UFO 50

605
00:39:22,552 --> 00:39:23,993
and finish one of them.

606
00:39:24,773 --> 00:39:29,475
Partly for our own mental health, as the fun of working on two projects at the same time

607
00:39:29,475 --> 00:39:33,878
was starting to wear off, and the pressure to release was really starting to build.

608
00:39:33,878 --> 00:39:40,281
Delays are common, of course, but having two delays going on at once wasn't feeling so

609
00:39:40,281 --> 00:39:42,323
great.

610
00:39:42,323 --> 00:39:47,806
And so we had to make a decision, and ultimately Spelunky 2 seemed like the game that was...

611
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:55,812
most likely to be finished in 2020. The roadmap for finishing it seemed clearer and it felt like

612
00:39:55,812 --> 00:40:01,656
if we buckled up and focused on it for a year we could get it out. It also had the most people

613
00:40:01,656 --> 00:40:08,661
waiting for it being a sequel and a known property and all that. So that was that. The rest of the

614
00:40:08,661 --> 00:40:15,826
UFO 50 continued to work on UFO 50 while Eric and I moved over to Spelunky 2 full-time to finish it.

615
00:40:17,429 --> 00:40:19,330
Since we were already working remotely,

616
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:25,555
it didn't feel like the pandemic had a huge effect on our work

617
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:29,057
in the last stretch of development.

618
00:40:29,057 --> 00:40:32,380
In fact, 2020 ended up being a very packed year for games,

619
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,863
with lots of big games, indie and AAA coming out last year.

620
00:40:36,863 --> 00:40:42,567
The PS5 and the Xbox Series X also dropped in 2020.

621
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:49,076
So for teams that could work well remotely, it may have seemed like a good time to release since

622
00:40:49,076 --> 00:40:52,880
so many people were stuck at home looking for something to play.

623
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,144
You know, and we were stuck at home looking for work to do also.

624
00:40:57,144 --> 00:40:58,465
So, uh

625
00:41:00,147 --> 00:41:04,994
But for us, you know, I think it was mostly a coincidence that we released in 2020.

626
00:41:04,994 --> 00:41:11,764
We had wanted to release Spelunky 2 in 2019, and when that deadline passed, we were just

627
00:41:11,764 --> 00:41:13,766
determined to get the game out the year after.

628
00:41:14,896 --> 00:41:19,658
But aside from being just a big year for games in general,

629
00:41:19,658 --> 00:41:21,980
it was also a big year for roguelikes, right?

630
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:27,423
Aside from Spelunky 2, there was Hades, Risk of Rain 2,

631
00:41:27,423 --> 00:41:32,685
Rogue Legacy 2, Noida, Atomicrops, and probably more.

632
00:41:32,685 --> 00:41:36,648
And they all, a lot of the big ones at least,

633
00:41:36,648 --> 00:41:38,308
ended up coming out pretty close to each other.

634
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:42,435
in the summer and fall.

635
00:41:42,435 --> 00:41:45,759
So, you know, was I worried about that?

636
00:41:45,759 --> 00:41:49,683
Honestly, yeah, it did make me a bit nervous.

637
00:41:49,683 --> 00:41:52,366
I was also concerned about Cyberpunk,

638
00:41:52,366 --> 00:41:55,129
which was originally slated for a September release.

639
00:41:56,148 --> 00:41:59,289
But I think all releases are like that.

640
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:02,110
You can spend years working on a game,

641
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:04,791
and then when it's time for the game to come out,

642
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:08,813
there's only so much you can do

643
00:42:08,813 --> 00:42:12,514
to control what's going on around it.

644
00:42:12,514 --> 00:42:14,115
And ultimately for us,

645
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:17,276
I don't think it would have made sense for us

646
00:42:17,276 --> 00:42:19,317
to delay the release into 2021

647
00:42:19,317 --> 00:42:20,978
just to avoid other roguelikes.

648
00:42:20,978 --> 00:42:25,419
And there's never any guarantee that waiting

649
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:32,054
going to make it any less packed.

650
00:42:32,054 --> 00:42:34,737
I do get asked about early access every now and then

651
00:42:34,737 --> 00:42:40,281
because it does seem like a popular and successful way

652
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:42,703
to make big roguelike games.

653
00:42:42,703 --> 00:42:43,243
But I don't know.

654
00:42:43,243 --> 00:42:45,165
For me, it just didn't feel right

655
00:42:45,165 --> 00:42:47,967
to release Spelunky that way.

656
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:50,589
I think there is a difference between updating

657
00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:53,412
a game in early access and updating it after release.

658
00:42:53,412 --> 00:42:54,332
And Spelunky.

659
00:42:55,268 --> 00:43:03,951
As this spiky arcade roguelike where I had a really strong idea for what I wanted it to be,

660
00:43:03,951 --> 00:43:12,973
it felt like it needed to come out and be fully released before we got serious feedback from the public.

661
00:43:12,973 --> 00:43:17,755
I wouldn't be averse to trying early access for games in the future,

662
00:43:17,755 --> 00:43:20,856
but it would probably be a very different type of game,

663
00:43:20,856 --> 00:43:23,496
something much more open-ended, like a...

664
00:43:24,725 --> 00:43:28,307
like a simulation or something like that.

665
00:43:28,307 --> 00:43:32,390
So, you know, ultimately it felt like we had to put our faith

666
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:38,233
in both the game in Spelunky 2 and in the roguelike genre

667
00:43:38,233 --> 00:43:42,256
as being something big enough to have all these games come out

668
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:44,197
at the same time and do well.

669
00:43:44,197 --> 00:43:47,099
So we set our release dates and went for it.

670
00:43:48,431 --> 00:43:54,317
You know, by the time September rolled around, we ended up having a staggered release on

671
00:43:54,317 --> 00:44:03,325
PS4 and then a couple weeks later on Steam. We focused on those two platforms because, you know,

672
00:44:03,325 --> 00:44:10,372
we had good relationships there and the majority of our audience

673
00:44:11,505 --> 00:44:16,671
of Spelunky fans were playing the game there.

674
00:44:16,671 --> 00:44:18,793
You know, the prevailing theory, of course,

675
00:44:18,793 --> 00:44:22,197
is that you release simultaneously on every platform at once

676
00:44:22,197 --> 00:44:25,520
and, you know, I'm sure that's great,

677
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,544
but given the size of our team, it just wasn't possible,

678
00:44:29,544 --> 00:44:32,207
especially since Spelunky 2 had online multiplayer.

679
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:42,324
For me personally, this was my first game released in seven years, so a lot had changed.

680
00:44:42,324 --> 00:44:44,028
I'm like an old man dad now.

681
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:47,157
You know, the scene has changed a lot too.

682
00:44:47,157 --> 00:44:51,959
People love roguelikes now and they know what Spelunky is.

683
00:44:51,959 --> 00:44:56,240
Press actively sought us out for interviews and reviews,

684
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,141
which is cool.

685
00:44:58,141 --> 00:45:01,202
Social media is much bigger now.

686
00:45:01,202 --> 00:45:03,983
So, you know, it gives developers and players

687
00:45:03,983 --> 00:45:08,025
and then media just a much more direct connection.

688
00:45:09,046 --> 00:45:17,049
Indie games are more serious now too, with serious studios and publishers in the indie

689
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:20,851
sphere doing some big things.

690
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:26,253
So in short, we were where we wanted to be, and I think we felt very fortunate.

691
00:45:26,253 --> 00:45:29,874
But also at the same time, the expectations were really high.

692
00:45:29,874 --> 00:45:37,698
And I think it was overwhelming how many people we were potentially connected to now.

693
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:45,440
You know, for me, I realized that this was another leveling up moment, starting from

694
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:50,542
when I was just working on click and play games as a kid.

695
00:45:50,542 --> 00:45:56,303
And we had to step up to make sure we were taking advantage of these opportunities that

696
00:45:56,303 --> 00:45:59,304
we had, that we were lucky enough to have.

697
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:08,854
So there were definitely some hiccups with the release, as you can see here.

698
00:46:08,854 --> 00:46:16,619
Aside from the usual chaos, bugs, and stuff like that, the online multiplayer launch on PS4 was

699
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:22,463
much more rough than we expected. When it worked for people, it worked quite well, but for many

700
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:28,847
people it was pretty much unplayable, or after playing for a few levels it would become unplayable.

701
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:37,864
So this forced us to delay the online multiplayer release on PC while Blit worked on fixes and

702
00:46:37,864 --> 00:46:45,048
added more servers. So again Guillermo goes into this in detail in his talk and it's really

703
00:46:45,048 --> 00:46:51,831
actually quite interesting. So again check that out if you want to hear more about it. Suffice to say though

704
00:46:52,479 --> 00:47:01,367
video games are very complex and adding online multiplayer to a game is just another layer of

705
00:47:01,367 --> 00:47:07,552
complexity. And we tried to be very clear that we were doing our best to fix it

706
00:47:07,552 --> 00:47:15,720
and just be very direct and upfront. And thankfully, most players were understanding.

707
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:19,523
Once the game released on Steam, it was easier to

708
00:47:21,731 --> 00:47:28,535
to get feedback for Blit and narrow down the various problems and, you know, quickly test

709
00:47:28,535 --> 00:47:30,036
possible solutions.

710
00:47:30,036 --> 00:47:36,160
So big thanks to all the Spelunky players who helped out during this time.

711
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:42,064
With their help, Blit was able to make the necessary improvements to online and yeah,

712
00:47:42,064 --> 00:47:49,508
thankfully it started to work well on PS4 and we were also able to launch it on Steam

713
00:47:49,508 --> 00:47:50,409
by Christmastime.

714
00:47:51,255 --> 00:47:54,976
And all in all, I'm happy with how things went.

715
00:47:54,976 --> 00:47:59,717
In hindsight, you always realize just how ambitious you

716
00:47:59,717 --> 00:48:02,197
were trying to make a game.

717
00:48:02,197 --> 00:48:06,558
And we really tried to do a lot with Spelunky 2.

718
00:48:06,558 --> 00:48:09,099
And in the end, I don't feel like we had to give up

719
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:11,039
on any of our major plans.

720
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:15,280
The game came out how we wanted it to.

721
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:15,980
And you know.

722
00:48:17,506 --> 00:48:22,448
more or less how I envisioned it, a dense, spiky, roguelike

723
00:48:22,448 --> 00:48:26,851
platformer.

724
00:48:26,851 --> 00:48:29,232
And the response from players has been great.

725
00:48:29,232 --> 00:48:33,014
And I'm very happy about that.

726
00:48:33,014 --> 00:48:34,134
I think with any sequel, there are

727
00:48:34,134 --> 00:48:38,777
going to be players that are going to be disappointed.

728
00:48:38,777 --> 00:48:40,798
But for the most part, it seemed like the game

729
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:44,399
was being enjoyed by veterans of the series and new players

730
00:48:44,399 --> 00:48:44,980
alike.

731
00:48:45,903 --> 00:48:49,525
compared to Spelunky 1.

732
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:52,547
Spelunky 2's lifetime revenue so far

733
00:48:52,547 --> 00:48:56,648
is actually getting close to overtaking Spelunky 1

734
00:48:56,648 --> 00:49:01,291
after just less than a year, which is pretty incredible.

735
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:04,172
And not only that, but the release of Spelunky 2

736
00:49:04,172 --> 00:49:08,614
actually, I think, created buzz for Spelunky 1

737
00:49:08,614 --> 00:49:11,675
and got more people excited about Spelunky 1 also.

738
00:49:11,675 --> 00:49:12,316
So, you know, that's...

739
00:49:16,032 --> 00:49:23,257
It's not bad at all for a game that I honestly think is weird in some ways.

740
00:49:23,257 --> 00:49:31,342
It straddles a lot of different concepts that I think can feel kind of opposed at times,

741
00:49:31,342 --> 00:49:33,364
as you can see here.

742
00:49:33,364 --> 00:49:38,087
And you know, it was a really big year for roguelikes, and people naturally wanted to

743
00:49:38,087 --> 00:49:38,867
compare them.

744
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:45,601
You know, if you're in the same conversation as a game like Hades, I think you're already

745
00:49:45,601 --> 00:49:47,703
doing something right.

746
00:49:47,703 --> 00:49:48,423
It's a cool game.

747
00:49:48,423 --> 00:49:56,329
But Spelunky, in my mind, it's a very different game from Hades, which is a very different

748
00:49:56,329 --> 00:50:02,194
game from Noita, which is such a different game from Risk of Rain, et cetera.

749
00:50:02,194 --> 00:50:05,836
So by any other metric, it really seems to me like...

750
00:50:07,177 --> 00:50:12,581
all of the major roguelikes that came out in 2020 were quite different from one another.

751
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:24,189
And they all found sizable audiences that really show how much room there is in this genre.

752
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:28,832
Some genres, I think, really lack the flexibility that roguelikes have,

753
00:50:28,832 --> 00:50:34,536
and they become saturated very quickly. But that's obviously not the case here, in my opinion.

754
00:50:36,846 --> 00:50:41,871
So yeah, I think that given our experience and what I've seen from other games, indie

755
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:47,456
game sequels make a lot of sense if the original game was successful and you're not burnt out

756
00:50:47,456 --> 00:50:48,217
on the concept.

757
00:50:48,217 --> 00:50:55,403
In the past, indie sequels weren't really a thing, partly because every indie game developer

758
00:50:55,403 --> 00:50:58,486
back then was just, we were figuring things out as we went along.

759
00:50:58,486 --> 00:51:01,789
There weren't many established indie studios.

760
00:51:02,753 --> 00:51:06,995
I don't think anyone was really thinking like super long-term about their career.

761
00:51:06,995 --> 00:51:10,737
We were just, you know, trying to get the game that was in front of us done.

762
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:15,999
By the end of a big project, it was pretty likely you'd be burnt out on the idea and

763
00:51:15,999 --> 00:51:20,081
want to shift gears completely once you're finished.

764
00:51:20,081 --> 00:51:26,903
You know, and I think indie developers in particular value novelty, but players for

765
00:51:26,903 --> 00:51:30,005
the most part are pretty excited to get more of what they already love.

766
00:51:31,498 --> 00:51:38,065
I definitely had that itch to work on new ideas while I was working on Spelunky 2.

767
00:51:38,065 --> 00:51:42,850
Having UFO 50 to work on obviously helped a ton, but the crazy thing is that

768
00:51:43,709 --> 00:51:46,750
It didn't make that feeling go away completely.

769
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:50,291
So it really goes to show you how strong that feeling

770
00:51:50,291 --> 00:51:51,731
of wanting to make something new is,

771
00:51:51,731 --> 00:51:53,331
no matter what you're doing.

772
00:51:53,331 --> 00:51:54,932
So, you know, what I do is,

773
00:51:54,932 --> 00:51:57,532
if I have a new idea that doesn't fit

774
00:51:57,532 --> 00:51:58,513
what I'm already working on,

775
00:51:58,513 --> 00:52:03,174
I write it down, no matter how silly the idea is.

776
00:52:03,174 --> 00:52:06,434
And sometimes that's really all you need

777
00:52:06,434 --> 00:52:07,495
to get it out of your system.

778
00:52:13,942 --> 00:52:21,405
And, you know, personally, I really enjoyed being able to connect all three Spelunky games together and make a series.

779
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:28,908
At times it felt like taking an old childhood drawing and getting to redo it as an adult, which was pretty cool.

780
00:52:28,908 --> 00:52:34,910
And, you know, looking back at it now, like, yeah, Spelunky just feels really big to me.

781
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:43,474
So while sequels make a lot of sense from a commercial perspective, I think they can be really fun from a creative perspective as well.

782
00:52:46,882 --> 00:52:52,827
So, you know, do I necessarily recommend doing all the things I described in this talk, like

783
00:52:52,827 --> 00:53:00,193
making a sequel or not changing the basic, you know, formula of the sequel too much,

784
00:53:00,193 --> 00:53:06,499
working on another game or a collection of games at the same time? Well, you know,

785
00:53:06,499 --> 00:53:13,125
it worked out for us, but Spelunky 2 was a unique project. UFO 50 is a unique project.

786
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,904
All games are unique, I think.

787
00:53:16,904 --> 00:53:22,792
They require unique circumstances to succeed, basically.

788
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:26,957
And I think it would be hard to replicate what we did exactly.

789
00:53:26,957 --> 00:53:30,842
Every game developer and game project is just a little different.

790
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:39,545
However, I do think that there are some things that may be helpful to other developers, just

791
00:53:39,545 --> 00:53:44,568
some general things that I thought about and learned as I was working.

792
00:53:45,637 --> 00:53:47,118
on Spelunky 2.

793
00:53:47,118 --> 00:53:49,439
The first is that making commercial art,

794
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:52,700
it's like a dance between you and the audience

795
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:56,482
where you're trying to find where your interests overlap

796
00:53:56,482 --> 00:53:59,183
with theirs, and you're also developing

797
00:53:59,183 --> 00:54:01,484
your skills at the same time.

798
00:54:01,484 --> 00:54:05,045
So we're talking about an activity that's incredibly

799
00:54:05,045 --> 00:54:06,466
complex and long term.

800
00:54:06,466 --> 00:54:08,686
So I think it's important to realize

801
00:54:08,686 --> 00:54:11,568
that Spelunky has now spanned three games

802
00:54:11,568 --> 00:54:13,008
across a decade of work.

803
00:54:13,593 --> 00:54:19,336
When I was working on Spelunky Classic, I had no idea if anyone would like it as much

804
00:54:19,336 --> 00:54:20,676
as I did.

805
00:54:20,676 --> 00:54:24,778
And I'm glad at that point that I only spent, you know, six months to a year working on

806
00:54:24,778 --> 00:54:27,480
it before releasing it as freeware.

807
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:32,582
So if people hadn't liked it, it would have been back to the drawing board.

808
00:54:32,582 --> 00:54:36,364
And the longer I spent on it, the more opportunities I would have lost.

809
00:54:36,847 --> 00:54:40,289
With Spelunky 2, I feel like I was able to realize

810
00:54:40,289 --> 00:54:44,352
the potential of the concept more fully,

811
00:54:44,352 --> 00:54:47,594
but in a much safer environment where I

812
00:54:47,594 --> 00:54:50,296
knew people liked the concept.

813
00:54:50,296 --> 00:54:53,819
So you can take multiple games to experiment and refine

814
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:54,339
your craft.

815
00:54:54,339 --> 00:54:56,701
I think that's something to remember.

816
00:54:56,701 --> 00:55:00,063
Two, it's kind of related, but these days I focus as much

817
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:00,824
on the process.

818
00:55:01,862 --> 00:55:06,844
of making games is the games themselves, because I have the experience now to know how hard

819
00:55:06,844 --> 00:55:08,165
game making is at any level.

820
00:55:08,165 --> 00:55:13,348
I don't just make a game because I want to make the game, I make it because it's also

821
00:55:13,348 --> 00:55:19,712
the right time to make it and the right people are around it to help me make it.

822
00:55:19,712 --> 00:55:23,294
And I never assume that a game is just going to get made out of sheer will.

823
00:55:23,294 --> 00:55:26,236
A lot of the decisions that you make...

824
00:55:27,377 --> 00:55:31,739
in the conceptual phase will either help you or haunt you

825
00:55:31,739 --> 00:55:36,922
once the development starts.

826
00:55:36,922 --> 00:55:43,746
So I think it's important to think about the process.

827
00:55:43,746 --> 00:55:47,849
Three, there's not one way to do this.

828
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:48,950
Like I said, I feel like.

829
00:55:49,527 --> 00:55:52,612
I was in a unique position.

830
00:55:52,612 --> 00:55:57,399
I am in a unique position where I've been at this so long and I have the opportunity

831
00:55:57,399 --> 00:56:04,550
to work with so many cool collaborators, but I still feel like very indie in my development.

832
00:56:05,767 --> 00:56:11,490
I'm still setting up my own websites and store pages and doing art and design and even some

833
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:12,631
programming.

834
00:56:12,631 --> 00:56:19,314
Whereas a lot of indies are much more specialized and working in studios where they work alongside

835
00:56:19,314 --> 00:56:22,615
the same people for many, many projects.

836
00:56:22,615 --> 00:56:26,397
And then there are game developers who are just totally solo.

837
00:56:27,563 --> 00:56:32,848
Indie game development to me is as much a lifestyle as a job.

838
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:35,850
So find a way of doing it that works for you.

839
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:41,054
And also realize that figuring out how to do it

840
00:56:41,054 --> 00:56:43,616
is a journey in and of itself.

841
00:56:43,616 --> 00:56:47,479
And then finally, yeah, I mean, roguelikes,

842
00:56:47,479 --> 00:56:50,662
I really believe will continue to be a strong genre

843
00:56:50,662 --> 00:56:52,684
for a long time.

844
00:56:52,684 --> 00:56:55,526
If that wasn't obvious before,

845
00:56:55,526 --> 00:56:56,547
then I think 2020's.

846
00:56:57,803 --> 00:57:02,947
indie roguelike bumper crop should definitely make that clear. If you want to make one,

847
00:57:02,947 --> 00:57:09,131
you should make one. But, you know, that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be a success.

848
00:57:09,131 --> 00:57:16,956
It just means that there is room. There is room for more.

849
00:57:16,956 --> 00:57:21,559
And then finally, you know, I did promise I would talk about the possibility.

850
00:57:22,508 --> 00:57:27,550
uh of uh more spelunkies since you know we're talking about sequels and all that

851
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:32,132
and honestly you're probably expecting this but yeah i don't have any idea right now

852
00:57:32,132 --> 00:57:38,974
right now i've got my hands full with more spelunky 2 work and also finishing ufo 50.

853
00:57:38,974 --> 00:57:44,876
after that i think i'm going to want to go back to solo development for a while and experiment

854
00:57:44,876 --> 00:57:50,298
again with new ideas and uh you know maybe new new game engines

855
00:57:51,398 --> 00:57:52,699
things like that.

856
00:57:52,699 --> 00:57:58,144
So definitely no Spelunky 3 anytime soon,

857
00:57:58,144 --> 00:57:59,125
but never say never.

858
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:02,968
And thank you so much for listening.

859
00:58:02,968 --> 00:58:07,391
And I hope you found this talk to be interesting and helpful.

860
00:58:07,391 --> 00:58:11,715
You can always reach me in these places.

861
00:58:11,715 --> 00:58:14,597
And yeah, have a great rest of your day.

862
00:58:14,597 --> 00:58:14,998
Thanks.
