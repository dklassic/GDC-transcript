1
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:11,366
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:12,987
Welcome.

3
00:00:12,987 --> 00:00:16,151
First of all, thank you very much, Andrew, for inviting me.

4
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:18,934
This is my first time at R Director's Bootcamp,

5
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:20,636
and it's been six years since I talked to GDC,

6
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:23,419
so I might be a little bit rusty.

7
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:25,921
Thank you all for showing up.

8
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:27,703
This is quite an audience.

9
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:30,406
I don't remember I've ever seen a room this full when

10
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:31,047
we did Killzone.

11
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:36,554
So let's first do full introductions.

12
00:00:36,554 --> 00:00:37,735
My name is Jan-Bert van Beek.

13
00:00:37,735 --> 00:00:40,178
I am the studio art director and animation art director

14
00:00:40,178 --> 00:00:41,700
at Guerrilla Games.

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,742
And as you may know, Guerrilla Games

16
00:00:43,742 --> 00:00:46,045
is part of Sony Worldwide Studios.

17
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:49,689
So that's a group of 14 very, very different game developers

18
00:00:49,689 --> 00:00:52,333
from Naughty Dog, Guerrilla, Media Molecule, Polyphony.

19
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:56,654
that all work together to make the first party portfolio of Sony.

20
00:00:56,654 --> 00:01:01,795
Now, we ourselves are Guerrilla, we're based in Amsterdam, lovely city.

21
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:05,536
And as you may know, the last title that we did was Horizon Zero Dawn,

22
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:09,517
which was also our first open world action role-playing game.

23
00:01:09,517 --> 00:01:11,837
So just to get an idea, who has played Horizon?

24
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:15,118
Very good. Who has finished Horizon?

25
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:19,599
Who has platinumed Horizon?

26
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,479
Thank you very much.

27
00:01:22,128 --> 00:01:27,434
Glad to see that our lead designer has a platinum.

28
00:01:27,434 --> 00:01:31,297
So before we start, let's start with a reminder of what

29
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:32,138
Horizon is.

30
00:01:32,138 --> 00:01:34,740
And here's our E3 trailer from 2016.

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,281
We know we weren't the first ones here.

32
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:12,883
Our stories speak of the ones that came before.

33
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,284
The Old Ones.

34
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:21,725
The world of the Old Ones was so different than ours.

35
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:26,427
They had built incredible cities.

36
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:34,409
With towers that reached the stars.

37
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:35,409
But a darkness came.

38
00:02:35,409 --> 00:02:40,211
And their cities turned to graves.

39
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:55,055
And without them, the land started to change.

40
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:57,076
Their great cities faded away.

41
00:03:01,657 --> 00:03:10,461
And in their place came new life.

42
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:25,448
Over time, one by one, the tribes came to these lands.

43
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:27,309
Some, small and humble.

44
00:03:27,309 --> 00:03:31,251
Some, powerful as kings.

45
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:36,850
They say my tribe was the first.

46
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,911
The first to hunt.

47
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:41,354
The first to raise our bows.

48
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:47,040
For this world was never ours.

49
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,543
We've always shared it.

50
00:03:49,543 --> 00:03:55,089
A dangerous balance between man and machine.

51
00:04:06,858 --> 00:04:07,718
There's the herd.

52
00:04:07,718 --> 00:04:08,798
It goes on and on and on.

53
00:04:08,798 --> 00:04:12,820
So today I'm going to talk a little bit about the

54
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,840
Our Direction Horizon.

55
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,241
But before we go there, I want to talk about the

56
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,321
idea behind Horizon.

57
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:19,482
We get this question a lot.

58
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:21,142
Where's the orange of the idea?

59
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:24,683
Where does this idea of a young girl hunting robo dinosaurs

60
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:27,664
in a post-apocalyptic world come from?

61
00:04:27,664 --> 00:04:31,866
And that all started in 2010, when our studio asked us, the

62
00:04:31,866 --> 00:04:34,407
development staff, to pitch ideas for a new game.

63
00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:37,929
Before that time, we had worked on Killzone

64
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:39,110
for almost a decade.

65
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,652
And Killzone, for those who know,

66
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:42,654
is a first-person shooter that is set

67
00:04:42,654 --> 00:04:44,976
in a dark and dystopian future.

68
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:47,378
And while Killzone had been moderately successful,

69
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:49,180
it never really was a great hit.

70
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,203
So after about six of these titles, we needed to reconsider.

71
00:04:52,203 --> 00:04:55,987
Is this really the best way to use our development team's

72
00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:57,208
time, talent, and effort?

73
00:04:58,688 --> 00:05:02,309
And some of you may have heard of the term franchise fatigue.

74
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:04,490
So unlike movie franchises, games

75
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,970
tend to get better with their sequels.

76
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,471
And that is basically because over time

77
00:05:09,471 --> 00:05:12,332
and over multiple titles, development teams really

78
00:05:12,332 --> 00:05:13,212
gets much better.

79
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:15,873
They get better at understanding the technology.

80
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:17,833
They get better at understanding each other.

81
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,834
And they get better at understanding what makes

82
00:05:19,834 --> 00:05:20,734
their particular game tick.

83
00:05:22,097 --> 00:05:24,639
So unless your company has a very high turnover and staff,

84
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,801
it's usually the case that the same people, the same team,

85
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:30,442
work on sequel after sequel.

86
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:33,344
Sometimes, as in our case, maybe more than a decade.

87
00:05:33,344 --> 00:05:34,845
And then at some point, that team

88
00:05:34,845 --> 00:05:36,166
gets tired after overworking it.

89
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:41,229
Although your knowledge and the team synergy and the skill sets

90
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:47,613
are all at peak performance, the results are sort of diminishing.

91
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:48,934
So after all, how many different games

92
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:50,855
can you make about a bunch of space Nazis

93
00:05:50,855 --> 00:05:51,715
with red glowing eyes?

94
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,151
So let's reboot completely.

95
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:56,131
Let's start from scratch.

96
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:59,772
Let's take all of our learnings, the learnings of my first IP,

97
00:05:59,772 --> 00:06:04,673
and see what we can do when we all start from scratch.

98
00:06:04,673 --> 00:06:07,234
So first, let me tell you a little bit about Sony in itself.

99
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,755
Sony has quite a unique structure.

100
00:06:09,755 --> 00:06:11,435
It's fundamentally bottom-up.

101
00:06:11,435 --> 00:06:13,276
So Sony doesn't really tell the studios

102
00:06:13,276 --> 00:06:15,096
what kind of games they make.

103
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:17,257
They let that figure out themselves.

104
00:06:17,798 --> 00:06:19,680
Of course, there's a little bit of typecasting going on.

105
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,804
Naughty Dog tends to basically make action shooters.

106
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:24,726
And Goliath used to make first-person shooters.

107
00:06:24,726 --> 00:06:27,048
Polyphony makes racing games.

108
00:06:27,048 --> 00:06:29,330
The God of War team makes God of War.

109
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,252
And so.

110
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:34,939
So figuring out what we're going to make is really up to us.

111
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:37,620
And in Guerrilla's case, we apply that structure all the

112
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,541
way down to the core of our process.

113
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,762
So we go to our own development staff and ask them

114
00:06:41,762 --> 00:06:45,404
what kinds of games they would like to make.

115
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,225
But before you try this at home, it's probably good to

116
00:06:47,225 --> 00:06:50,487
understand that this level of creative freedom often needs a

117
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:51,847
lot of guidance to be successful.

118
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,600
I'm not sure how many of you are familiar with this diagram.

119
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,081
It's the double diamond design process.

120
00:06:58,081 --> 00:07:00,322
It gets used a lot in complicated processes

121
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:02,644
like service design.

122
00:07:02,644 --> 00:07:03,784
And to be honest, Becky.

123
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:05,730
We didn't actually know that this was a thing

124
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,191
until we had made the game.

125
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:09,653
And then we heard about it, and we were like, oh, that's

126
00:07:09,653 --> 00:07:11,735
kind of what we did.

127
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:13,796
So in hindsight, we did this instinctively.

128
00:07:13,796 --> 00:07:15,377
But it makes a lot of sense.

129
00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:17,579
So if you think about it, the pitch process

130
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,661
that I'm about to describe is this discover phase.

131
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:23,764
And you want to go as wide as possible with the ideas

132
00:07:23,764 --> 00:07:24,244
that you gather.

133
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:27,996
And then as you go forward, you go narrow again

134
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:29,577
as you try to define a core of a game.

135
00:07:29,577 --> 00:07:32,778
And then you go sort of broad again, wide again.

136
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:35,519
It's sort of this cycle of adding new ideas

137
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:36,799
and then subtracting the bad ideas.

138
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:38,980
But even in the discover phase, you

139
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,921
need to have some sort of direction

140
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:42,802
because you need to go somewhere.

141
00:07:42,802 --> 00:07:45,743
Otherwise, you just get this explosion of creativity.

142
00:07:45,743 --> 00:07:48,123
And then it's really hard to define it down again

143
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:50,924
to what the focus is of something.

144
00:07:50,924 --> 00:07:53,005
So I'm going to describe a little bit,

145
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,966
making how we focused our creativity.

146
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:58,357
We put together this brief that went to everybody

147
00:07:58,357 --> 00:08:00,859
in an entire company with a very specific mission.

148
00:08:00,859 --> 00:08:03,841
Develop an epic and cinematic character-driven game universe

149
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:06,023
with intense action-packed gameplay,

150
00:08:06,023 --> 00:08:09,326
strong storytelling set in a distinct and rich universe.

151
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:12,048
Yeah, good luck with that.

152
00:08:12,048 --> 00:08:14,230
So it's a really, really big statement.

153
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:16,892
And it's actually pretty open.

154
00:08:16,892 --> 00:08:18,913
What it mostly says is don't come up

155
00:08:18,913 --> 00:08:21,375
with a mobile puzzle game.

156
00:08:23,062 --> 00:08:26,205
And because we have all this creative autonomy as a studio,

157
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:27,686
we felt an enormous responsibility

158
00:08:27,686 --> 00:08:30,249
to do this right, not just creatively, but also

159
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:32,311
strategically and commercially.

160
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,114
So the nine-page briefing that we sent out,

161
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:38,958
we concluded a whole broad range of topics.

162
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,799
We didn't exclude any genre, but there

163
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,823
were a couple of considerations that people needed to take.

164
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,304
First of all, Begi, you know.

165
00:08:46,103 --> 00:08:47,644
Think about this from Sony perspective,

166
00:08:47,644 --> 00:08:49,884
maybe what is missing in their portfolio.

167
00:08:49,884 --> 00:08:52,925
And of course, maybe one thing that was missing

168
00:08:52,925 --> 00:08:54,045
was RPG and action RPG.

169
00:08:54,045 --> 00:08:56,486
And there were other considerations like,

170
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:58,727
okay, we're good at some things.

171
00:08:58,727 --> 00:08:59,987
We have really good tech.

172
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:02,708
We have good experience making with combat mechanics.

173
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,508
We're good at making pretty arts.

174
00:09:04,508 --> 00:09:07,009
We have maybe a very good team of concept artists

175
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:08,389
and a very good design team as well.

176
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,942
But, you know, what can we do, maybe, with all these things that we've learned doing Killzone

177
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:16,725
and come up with something, maybe, that uses or that leverages that knowledge

178
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:19,847
without, maybe, just doing the same thing over and over again?

179
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:23,410
And, of course, maybe we discuss other things as well, like, you know, market saturations,

180
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,792
certain trends that were appearing, a whole bunch of different things

181
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:28,413
that people could take into consideration.

182
00:09:29,887 --> 00:09:31,788
But mostly we asked them to think really big.

183
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:33,750
The ambition for this new concept

184
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,512
was to create a world that would be rich enough

185
00:09:36,512 --> 00:09:38,273
to explore in not just a series of games,

186
00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:40,935
but potentially also books and movies and onwards.

187
00:09:40,935 --> 00:09:43,597
Make you really think about franchise building instead

188
00:09:43,597 --> 00:09:44,999
of making just a single game idea.

189
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:48,962
In total, we received about 30 to 40 pitches.

190
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:52,244
This is just a very small sample of what we could still find.

191
00:09:52,244 --> 00:09:55,187
And so what was kind of.

192
00:09:55,763 --> 00:10:00,314
All it is, we didn't really specifically ask them to come up with ideas that were as

193
00:10:00,314 --> 00:10:01,577
opposite as possible from Killzone,

194
00:10:01,577 --> 00:10:04,684
but it's more something that sort of naturally came out of the process.

195
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:10,106
And many of the pitches that we got, they hit on recurring notes.

196
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:13,507
There were certain themes that we all gravitated towards.

197
00:10:13,507 --> 00:10:16,468
So, very clearly we were done with dystopian worlds

198
00:10:16,468 --> 00:10:19,609
full of glass and steel and concrete and bullets.

199
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:23,010
And instead we wanted to build very lush and very rich worlds.

200
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,670
I guess making sort of like, that's what franchise fatigue does.

201
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,111
You can sort of want to make the other thing.

202
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,492
But thankfully, we weren't really done with robots and mechs.

203
00:10:31,492 --> 00:10:36,656
We love that, we love a healthy dose of cool science fiction machines.

204
00:10:36,656 --> 00:10:39,759
But mostly we wanted to create something that was very unique.

205
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,501
Something that has a positive tone to it.

206
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:48,646
Something that felt very fresh, something that would be eye-catching, evocative, and

207
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:51,409
mostly something that would stand out in the marketplace.

208
00:10:51,409 --> 00:10:53,270
And Horizon clearly stood out.

209
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,506
from all the different concepts that were pitched.

210
00:10:57,506 --> 00:11:00,728
It was by far the favorite pitch among our own staff.

211
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:03,208
And also, when we showed a couple of concepts

212
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,689
to our colleagues at Sony,

213
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:06,609
everybody said like, make this one.

214
00:11:06,609 --> 00:11:07,890
Making it sort of, it's weird

215
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,131
and you're probably gonna fail,

216
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:14,052
but you know, it's at least something new.

217
00:11:14,052 --> 00:11:16,533
So, what was it about Horizon that drew people in?

218
00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:19,664
Now, to some degree, we're still trying to figure that out.

219
00:11:19,664 --> 00:11:21,966
But we've got a couple of ideas.

220
00:11:21,966 --> 00:11:24,328
First of all, it had a lot of very contrasting elements,

221
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:28,691
lots of juxtapositions that created intrigue and tension.

222
00:11:28,691 --> 00:11:31,873
So let's take a look at some of Verizon's many themes.

223
00:11:31,873 --> 00:11:35,736
First of all, it is a world where the flow of time

224
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,097
appears to have been reversed.

225
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,519
We've got a primitive age that has come

226
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,940
after an age of high technology.

227
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,443
And it's a world where the world of science

228
00:11:44,443 --> 00:11:46,525
has become the world of mythology and magic.

229
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,314
And it's a world that questions the definition of life as we know it,

230
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:54,338
where the artificial has become the natural.

231
00:11:54,338 --> 00:12:00,246
Now, usually going for high-concept science fiction is a very, very hard sell.

232
00:12:01,574 --> 00:12:03,914
But thankfully we got some help from James Cameron.

233
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:07,075
In 2009, Avatar came out and it showed the whole world

234
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:09,756
that the audience are still interested

235
00:12:09,756 --> 00:12:11,776
in very high concept science fiction.

236
00:12:11,776 --> 00:12:12,936
But in order to succeed,

237
00:12:12,936 --> 00:12:15,937
it needs to deliver something new and fresh.

238
00:12:15,937 --> 00:12:18,938
Now, Avatar, although it's a science fiction movie,

239
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:20,218
it's actually a back to nature story.

240
00:12:20,218 --> 00:12:21,879
It's about a space faring civilization

241
00:12:21,879 --> 00:12:24,359
that clashes with the tribal inhabitants

242
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:26,320
of a far away world.

243
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,463
And it's a world where they celebrate this.

244
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:32,144
They celebrate the magic of nature.

245
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:34,946
So it's science fiction, but it's very relatable,

246
00:12:34,946 --> 00:12:36,127
and it's also very relevant.

247
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:39,010
It asks a couple of important questions,

248
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,952
like whether technology and nature are opposing forces.

249
00:12:41,952 --> 00:12:44,034
In the years before Avatar, there

250
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:47,917
was a sort of reassurgence in the appreciation

251
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:48,958
of the natural world.

252
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:51,240
You may remember the Planet Earth series,

253
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,301
the ones about the oceans, a whole bunch

254
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:56,023
of these very lush, beautifully made documentaries.

255
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:59,353
And ironically, it was actually new technologies and film

256
00:12:59,353 --> 00:13:01,754
technology that made these things possible.

257
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:04,635
So we saw this aspect of new technology

258
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:07,175
actually heightening the natural experience

259
00:13:07,175 --> 00:13:08,075
instead of fighting it.

260
00:13:08,075 --> 00:13:11,716
Then basically, on the other side, became aware of the flip

261
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:13,577
side of technological advances, the notion

262
00:13:13,577 --> 00:13:16,117
that if you push nature too far, it might just

263
00:13:16,117 --> 00:13:17,858
basically push back.

264
00:13:17,858 --> 00:13:20,698
And this created a new type of apocalyptic end

265
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:21,578
of the world scenario.

266
00:13:23,048 --> 00:13:24,770
So there are a couple of apocalyptic scenarios

267
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,752
that have existed for very long.

268
00:13:26,752 --> 00:13:29,695
You've got the very old ones from the 50s and the 60s,

269
00:13:29,695 --> 00:13:34,479
like the alien invasion, or the nuclear war, or the zombies.

270
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:37,302
And then sometimes, maybe, new things

271
00:13:37,302 --> 00:13:40,465
come into fashion because of new societal fears.

272
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:44,008
So now we have movies about global environmental collapse,

273
00:13:44,008 --> 00:13:46,751
or the rise of the machines, or smart monkeys.

274
00:13:48,976 --> 00:13:54,380
In any case, there are many different types of stories that describe the events of apocalypse.

275
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,983
They all focus on showing the events that are preceding it or during the apocalypse.

276
00:13:58,983 --> 00:14:01,525
And to some degree, most of them are actually disaster movies.

277
00:14:02,678 --> 00:14:04,860
And now when we get to the post-apocalypse,

278
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,582
we suddenly see this enormous loss of conceptual variety.

279
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:11,203
What we pretty much end up with is wastelands

280
00:14:11,203 --> 00:14:12,304
with lots of bad people.

281
00:14:12,304 --> 00:14:14,966
They tend to be dark, decrepit worlds

282
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:16,467
filled with constant danger,

283
00:14:16,467 --> 00:14:18,708
and most commonly, actually the biggest danger

284
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:21,469
is other people because other people are bad.

285
00:14:21,469 --> 00:14:23,851
And so it's all about trying to survive

286
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:24,911
in these harsh worlds.

287
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:28,336
This sort of end of the world scenario,

288
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:30,058
it has certainly fascinated storytellers

289
00:14:30,058 --> 00:14:32,301
and audience alike for a very long time,

290
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:34,804
but these worlds, these are depicted,

291
00:14:34,804 --> 00:14:37,868
they've become very overly familiar to our audiences.

292
00:14:37,868 --> 00:14:40,271
And Horizon promised sort of like a different view on that,

293
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:41,492
a different view on the apocalypse.

294
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:46,989
So it's a common notion that the end of mankind is automatically the end of the world.

295
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:49,750
And of course, the reality is that that's very far from the truth.

296
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:54,852
Our planet has survived something like six total near extinctions of all life.

297
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,233
And life tends to come back every single time.

298
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:59,214
It's the Michael Crichton thing. Life finds a way.

299
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:05,843
And so, Horizon promised a new sort of escape from the dreariness of the post-apocalypse.

300
00:15:05,843 --> 00:15:09,606
Basically, we started describing it as the post-poke-apocalypse.

301
00:15:09,606 --> 00:15:12,349
And maybe there's even a post-post-post-apocalypse.

302
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:15,651
So it's a new type of world.

303
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:18,874
It's not a dystopian one, it's not a utopian world either.

304
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:23,598
But it's one that sort of blossomed on the ashes of our world, to call it, to say it very prosaic.

305
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:26,499
It's a world that isn't really concerned

306
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:28,660
with the past anymore.

307
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,982
The apocalypse in Horizon has become the stuff of myths.

308
00:15:31,982 --> 00:15:34,984
Those dark days are over and life has moved on.

309
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:38,847
So in some degree, Horizon offers like a hopeful view

310
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:40,268
of the end of civilization.

311
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:43,910
One that's not about morbid display of death,

312
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,732
but one that highlights sort of new and brighter worlds

313
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:48,293
that comes after all that death.

314
00:15:49,861 --> 00:15:52,103
And within fiction, there aren't many stories that really

315
00:15:52,103 --> 00:15:53,545
explore the world that comes after.

316
00:15:53,545 --> 00:15:57,048
And creatively, that helps to some degree,

317
00:15:57,048 --> 00:15:59,110
as the audience doesn't have a lot of expectations

318
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:00,391
about these worlds.

319
00:16:00,391 --> 00:16:02,673
So it allows you to be a little bit bolder

320
00:16:02,673 --> 00:16:06,057
and use surprise and intrigues to interest the audience

321
00:16:06,057 --> 00:16:07,938
with something new and unfamiliar.

322
00:16:10,742 --> 00:16:17,304
But the stories that do exist, they often add a very fascinating ingredient to the post-apocalyptic mix.

323
00:16:17,304 --> 00:16:18,065
And that's mystery.

324
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:20,946
Almost in every one of these, there is a detective story going on.

325
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,847
It's the question of what happened, who done it.

326
00:16:23,847 --> 00:16:28,008
And those setups are usually very intellectually compelling to an audience.

327
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:31,629
They get to mentally explore this world.

328
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:34,930
They get to mentally explore something that's unknown and mysterious to them.

329
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,991
And in that regard, it's a real proper adventure.

330
00:16:39,015 --> 00:16:41,957
But it's also harder, especially from an art directional point

331
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:44,219
of view, to make that believable.

332
00:16:44,219 --> 00:16:46,041
If it intrigues the audience, but it

333
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,743
doesn't make sense to them, they're

334
00:16:47,743 --> 00:16:50,425
not going to keep engaged in your fantasy for very long.

335
00:16:50,425 --> 00:16:53,608
And that's the ultimate trick of production design,

336
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:55,069
that production design has to pull off,

337
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:57,411
to create a world with a sense of authenticity

338
00:16:57,411 --> 00:17:00,674
and believability.

339
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:02,416
Now, in our visual design process,

340
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,818
we generally avoid rushing towards an end visual.

341
00:17:05,452 --> 00:17:09,673
It's something we take a lot of time to really research every element that's part of the sum

342
00:17:09,673 --> 00:17:12,655
that makes up the final piece of key art.

343
00:17:12,655 --> 00:17:16,596
So we don't just throw everything together at the same time,

344
00:17:16,596 --> 00:17:18,797
but we very slowly layer the elements carefully together.

345
00:17:18,797 --> 00:17:23,599
A key inspiration in our process was Alan Weissman's book, The World Without Us.

346
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,280
Who has read this book?

347
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,021
Very few people, thankfully.

348
00:17:27,021 --> 00:17:28,362
That's why we got to make Horizon.

349
00:17:29,902 --> 00:17:34,745
So in this book he describes a scenario where suddenly all humans have disappeared from Earth.

350
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:38,206
And he doesn't really explain why, because that's not really that important.

351
00:17:38,206 --> 00:17:42,468
But one of the things that he does in the book is that he very carefully describes the process of how

352
00:17:42,468 --> 00:17:47,830
all traces of mankind, all evidence of mankind over the ages will finally disappear.

353
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:55,073
And there's this nice little moment at the end of the book where he describes, maybe, the last thing, maybe, that will remain of humanity.

354
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:55,494
Who can guess?

355
00:17:55,494 --> 00:17:57,715
No, it's the Voyager.

356
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:01,579
Because when our sun finally goes supernova,

357
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:06,360
this thing is literally in another galaxy.

358
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,801
So we started to recreate that process.

359
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:11,162
We took a typical American Midwestern town,

360
00:18:11,162 --> 00:18:13,602
because why not, and started to visualize

361
00:18:13,602 --> 00:18:14,862
what would happen to that.

362
00:18:14,862 --> 00:18:17,563
So in Horizons' background story,

363
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,104
the apocalypse destroyed all biomatter.

364
00:18:20,104 --> 00:18:22,084
So it's a completely lifeless desert,

365
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:24,425
and all the soil has turned to sand.

366
00:18:25,496 --> 00:18:28,698
So we started studying what would happen to buildings,

367
00:18:28,698 --> 00:18:31,660
to villages, to cities in these type of desert environments.

368
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,222
And of course, you'll see some really typical patterns.

369
00:18:34,222 --> 00:18:36,424
Roofs start to collapse, then the walls,

370
00:18:36,424 --> 00:18:39,747
and then the facades basically collapse.

371
00:18:39,747 --> 00:18:42,489
But sometimes arches and columns stay around,

372
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:45,571
that's why we still see them in some of the ancient ruins.

373
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:49,374
And chimneys, for some reason chimneys stay up forever.

374
00:18:49,374 --> 00:18:50,575
Thousands of years even,

375
00:18:50,575 --> 00:18:52,217
the landscapes are littered with them.

376
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:57,048
And also because there's no fiber in the ground anymore,

377
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:58,029
there's no roots anymore,

378
00:18:58,029 --> 00:19:01,051
maybe the soil itself starts to move like a liquid.

379
00:19:01,051 --> 00:19:03,532
It becomes sand dunes, it starts to move around.

380
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:05,234
So it starts to flow around buildings,

381
00:19:05,234 --> 00:19:07,255
cover them as the wind pushes it.

382
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:09,637
And these shifting sands affect the ruins of course,

383
00:19:09,637 --> 00:19:12,399
maybe they push the ruins, they fill the ruins,

384
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:15,261
they change everything about the landscape

385
00:19:15,261 --> 00:19:18,963
till it's been completely changed.

386
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,432
we started imagining how life would return.

387
00:19:22,432 --> 00:19:24,933
It would probably first spring up in places

388
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:26,794
where the soil can hold water.

389
00:19:26,794 --> 00:19:30,536
The moment that rains come back, and then life

390
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,257
starts to spread everywhere.

391
00:19:32,257 --> 00:19:34,378
And then you'll end up with something

392
00:19:34,378 --> 00:19:37,220
like this, where it's very much buried and overgrown

393
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,040
at the same time.

394
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,142
And this is the key of making it look like 1,000 years

395
00:19:41,142 --> 00:19:42,783
instead of like 50 years after the apocalypse.

396
00:19:42,783 --> 00:19:45,644
The whole notion that the landscape itself

397
00:19:45,644 --> 00:19:47,385
would have vastly changed.

398
00:19:51,778 --> 00:19:53,219
And then we took it a little bit further,

399
00:19:53,219 --> 00:19:54,280
hundreds of years further.

400
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,381
So at some point, you've got skyscrapers

401
00:19:56,381 --> 00:19:58,643
that start to crumble and they become hills again

402
00:19:58,643 --> 00:20:01,004
because of the alluvial lines around them.

403
00:20:01,004 --> 00:20:03,106
And rivers, of course, change course

404
00:20:03,106 --> 00:20:04,867
and start to cut new canyons through the structure.

405
00:20:04,867 --> 00:20:08,249
And the whole landscape becomes unrecognizable,

406
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,511
but very old feeling at the same time.

407
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:13,993
The following movie that I'm about to show

408
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:17,055
is the first art benchmark that we created.

409
00:20:17,055 --> 00:20:18,056
So this was back in 2014.

410
00:20:19,102 --> 00:20:23,066
She'll bear making one of the artists working on it, one of the two artists working on this.

411
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:28,192
So this is about one year into production and about two and a half years before we go to release.

412
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:23,398
You

413
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:52,703
you

414
00:22:45,951 --> 00:22:48,773
The old Nipple logo.

415
00:22:48,773 --> 00:22:52,936
So if you're interested in how we made this,

416
00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:56,478
Gilbert will be doing a talk on Friday.

417
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:57,939
So this is my plug for his talk.

418
00:22:57,939 --> 00:23:01,361
So the final combined results of all these elements

419
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:05,844
is one of Horizons' three conceptual pillars.

420
00:23:05,844 --> 00:23:08,386
And I'll explain a little bit, maybe,

421
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:11,148
what we mean with the pillars.

422
00:23:11,148 --> 00:23:13,729
So at Guerilla, we use a game design process

423
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:15,230
that we call the pillar mythology.

424
00:23:15,757 --> 00:23:18,559
The game pillars are a set of key statements

425
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,140
about the intended experience.

426
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,042
And it takes quite a bit of time to craft these pillars,

427
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:25,524
as all the wording of it is carefully tuned

428
00:23:25,524 --> 00:23:27,385
until all the pillars say exactly

429
00:23:27,385 --> 00:23:28,947
what the creative intent is.

430
00:23:28,947 --> 00:23:30,588
So there shouldn't be one word too many,

431
00:23:30,588 --> 00:23:32,029
there must not be a word too less.

432
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:33,690
Every single word, Becky, that's in there is there

433
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:35,011
for a reason.

434
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:37,113
And so Horizons' environment with its wilderness

435
00:23:37,113 --> 00:23:39,895
and its overgrown ruins is one of these pillars.

436
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:42,096
And the other two pillars are about tribal culture

437
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:43,097
and the machines.

438
00:23:43,097 --> 00:23:43,898
And of course, Becky.

439
00:23:44,242 --> 00:23:46,843
the fourth implicit one, making that as alloy.

440
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:48,944
So remember the double diamond?

441
00:23:48,944 --> 00:23:51,786
These pillars sit at the midpoint of the double diamond.

442
00:23:51,786 --> 00:23:55,168
It's the smallest, most compact way

443
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:57,069
of describing the core experience of the game.

444
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:00,151
The pillar statement that we have of the tribes

445
00:24:00,151 --> 00:24:01,612
was the one on screen here.

446
00:24:01,612 --> 00:24:04,414
And as you can see, it's quite a mouthful.

447
00:24:04,414 --> 00:24:06,415
But one of the key observations that we

448
00:24:06,415 --> 00:24:09,177
from the art directional team, making took out of it

449
00:24:09,177 --> 00:24:11,378
is that it's talks in pluralities.

450
00:24:11,378 --> 00:24:14,040
Sorry about that, not my native language.

451
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:18,576
So, it talks about cultures and stories and characters.

452
00:24:18,576 --> 00:24:20,837
It's really about volume.

453
00:24:20,837 --> 00:24:23,797
So our job wasn't just to design one rich tribal culture,

454
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:26,978
but actually a whole range of them.

455
00:24:26,978 --> 00:24:30,518
And a pillar doesn't just have subtext about volume,

456
00:24:30,518 --> 00:24:32,079
it also implies diversity,

457
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:34,659
it implies distinction and believability.

458
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:37,060
And especially believability can be very challenging.

459
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:40,380
Now the process that we use to achieve believability

460
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,621
is something that we call intrinsic ideation.

461
00:24:43,158 --> 00:24:46,721
because we love pretentious terms.

462
00:24:46,721 --> 00:24:49,603
Now, some of you may have heard about the rule of cool.

463
00:24:49,603 --> 00:24:52,165
The rule of cool states that things are always cooler

464
00:24:52,165 --> 00:24:55,227
if you just keep adding other cool stuff on top

465
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,008
of your cool idea stuff.

466
00:24:57,008 --> 00:24:58,429
And the problem, of course, with this

467
00:24:58,429 --> 00:24:59,529
is, basically, that it completely

468
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:01,311
destroys the believability of any idea,

469
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:04,953
as you keep adding and adding more mismatched ideas to it.

470
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:06,454
Now, I already see you guys thinking,

471
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:08,315
basically, aren't you the guys that added robot dinosaurs

472
00:25:08,315 --> 00:25:08,756
to a game?

473
00:25:08,756 --> 00:25:10,177
So I'll talk about that later.

474
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:17,232
Intrinsic ideation doesn't allow you to just add cool stuff to it.

475
00:25:17,232 --> 00:25:20,935
Everything you design has to be there for a reason.

476
00:25:20,935 --> 00:25:25,017
And there has to be a reason why it looks the way that it looks.

477
00:25:25,017 --> 00:25:27,519
So before we started designing describable cultures,

478
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,841
our first question was, how does culture develop in the real world?

479
00:25:30,841 --> 00:25:33,203
So we studied a lot of theories, and actually,

480
00:25:33,203 --> 00:25:36,385
maybe John, our narrative director, says maybe that we're probably

481
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:38,606
the group of people with the highest density of reading

482
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:40,147
Guns, Herbs, and Steel in the world that he knows.

483
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:45,537
And maybe, anthropologists maybe don't agree on everything,

484
00:25:45,537 --> 00:25:47,118
but they do agree on a couple of things.

485
00:25:47,118 --> 00:25:50,039
And one of the common things that they do agree on

486
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:53,060
is that culture is all about resources.

487
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,141
So the resources that an environment provides,

488
00:25:55,141 --> 00:25:57,522
that's what defines a culture.

489
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,783
So let's take a look at one of the tribal cultures

490
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:02,263
in Horizon, the Nora tribe.

491
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:05,605
So this is a tribe that lives in the Rocky Mountains.

492
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,005
And so we can sort of say, well, OK,

493
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:09,786
what does the environment tell us about this tribe?

494
00:26:09,786 --> 00:26:10,347
So for one.

495
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:13,717
Mountain train isn't really suited for agriculture.

496
00:26:13,717 --> 00:26:17,139
So without farming, food will have to come from hunting.

497
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:19,520
So most likely, we're looking at a hunting-gathering

498
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,261
lifestyle.

499
00:26:21,261 --> 00:26:23,822
And without agriculture, there's also a limit on how

500
00:26:23,822 --> 00:26:27,084
large a tribe can become, because there's no real way of

501
00:26:27,084 --> 00:26:28,805
creating surplus food and storing it.

502
00:26:28,805 --> 00:26:33,327
So also making it smaller tribes, people tend to do

503
00:26:33,327 --> 00:26:33,947
everything.

504
00:26:33,947 --> 00:26:37,029
There isn't really space for people to specialize in

505
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:39,890
tailors, or carpenters, or tradesmen, or video game

506
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:40,410
developers.

507
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,972
So, making it sort of limits, making it a variety of professions that you see there

508
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:49,295
and making what that means for the things and the tools that you see as well.

509
00:26:49,295 --> 00:26:51,676
And then of course, making it our high mountain passes,

510
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,617
and that makes traits much higher.

511
00:26:53,617 --> 00:26:57,620
So, you can expect to see making it as people tend to be quite self-reliant

512
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,321
and also a little bit weird or stranger.

513
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:04,204
Actually, sort of what you see with a lot of people making it have grown up into mountains,

514
00:27:04,204 --> 00:27:05,505
they tend to be a little bit weird.

515
00:27:05,505 --> 00:27:05,565
Now...

516
00:27:09,721 --> 00:27:13,905
Also in our background story, a couple of important narrative

517
00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:15,907
as well as game design decisions were made.

518
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:17,989
And for one, there was a clear statement

519
00:27:17,989 --> 00:27:20,031
that there weren't any large animals anymore.

520
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:22,894
So there weren't any cows, there weren't any horses,

521
00:27:22,894 --> 00:27:26,117
there weren't any bears or mountain lions.

522
00:27:26,117 --> 00:27:29,360
So our designers started from there.

523
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,483
What do these limitations mean for, for example, clothing?

524
00:27:33,715 --> 00:27:36,377
Because that means that you only have small heights,

525
00:27:36,377 --> 00:27:38,339
you only have rabbits and you have foxes,

526
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:39,780
all kind of tiny patches.

527
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,202
So that basically means that all your clothing

528
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,464
needs to be compiled out of these smaller things

529
00:27:44,464 --> 00:27:47,587
and you end up with very much patchworks.

530
00:27:47,587 --> 00:27:48,668
And also we figured maybe...

531
00:27:49,138 --> 00:27:50,218
They won't have cotton.

532
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:51,439
Cotton is actually quite hard to grow.

533
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:53,219
But they might have wool.

534
00:27:53,219 --> 00:27:55,340
So maybe they would have to do something

535
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,461
with wild mountain goats.

536
00:27:57,461 --> 00:28:00,022
And although weaving might be too complex,

537
00:28:00,022 --> 00:28:01,923
because that requires very complex equipment,

538
00:28:01,923 --> 00:28:04,584
they would still be able to braid and knit things together.

539
00:28:06,354 --> 00:28:10,999
And so we also figured out that if they were able to do braiding and knitting,

540
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:12,801
they would be able to make rope.

541
00:28:12,801 --> 00:28:16,044
And so let's see how important rope can be for them.

542
00:28:16,044 --> 00:28:18,327
Because it's an important thing that you need for hunting.

543
00:28:18,327 --> 00:28:22,231
You need it for traps and bows and fish nets and all kinds of hunting gear.

544
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:26,216
So I'm going to guess these people are quite good at using rope and making stuff with rope.

545
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:35,121
And then, frankly, from that, it's sort of imaginable that they would use rope in all kinds of other key elements in their construction techniques.

546
00:28:35,121 --> 00:28:41,643
So it would be a way, basically, that they would put larger wooden structures together and even, basically, extend that to architecture.

547
00:28:43,073 --> 00:28:48,575
Of course, architecture itself, there's a lot of trees in the mountains, or some mountains.

548
00:28:48,575 --> 00:28:51,716
So that again informs what they would be building from.

549
00:28:51,716 --> 00:28:54,877
They wouldn't be making things out of mud or stone.

550
00:28:54,877 --> 00:28:58,198
They would be using the most pliable material they could find around.

551
00:28:58,198 --> 00:29:02,580
So as you can see, we're sort of layering these elements on top of each other in a logical structure.

552
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,760
Everything is there for a reason.

553
00:29:05,585 --> 00:29:08,406
Now as this process of ideation continues,

554
00:29:08,406 --> 00:29:10,247
you start to get the outlines of a culture.

555
00:29:10,247 --> 00:29:13,409
But the problem is, in our earliest things,

556
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:15,250
making the thing starts to look very mundane.

557
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:18,832
Making an image like this would just as easily

558
00:29:18,832 --> 00:29:21,333
fit in the world of Lord of the Rings or in Game of Thrones.

559
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:25,255
But there is, of course, making one truly unique element

560
00:29:25,255 --> 00:29:27,297
in the world of Horizon.

561
00:29:27,297 --> 00:29:29,338
And that is sure to have a very large impact

562
00:29:29,338 --> 00:29:31,039
on the development of all cultures.

563
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,000
And that's the presence of these giant animal-like machines.

564
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:41,114
So for example, what effect would it have on clothing?

565
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:44,539
Now, in some degree, these metal plates are sort of like bones.

566
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:48,123
And bones are actually quite bad for making armor with,

567
00:29:48,123 --> 00:29:49,785
because they break and are quite brittle.

568
00:29:49,785 --> 00:29:51,647
But what would happen, if you start

569
00:29:51,647 --> 00:29:53,229
using these armor plates in our clothing,

570
00:29:53,229 --> 00:29:54,250
would that make sense?

571
00:29:55,012 --> 00:29:57,953
So we started experimenting with this look where the metal

572
00:29:57,953 --> 00:30:00,195
parts would be embedded in their clothing.

573
00:30:00,195 --> 00:30:02,056
And that actually started to make sense.

574
00:30:02,056 --> 00:30:05,899
This would actually be a feasible idea for them.

575
00:30:05,899 --> 00:30:08,941
So we began experimenting with ways to include them in older

576
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:11,342
hunting gears, looking at how these elements would mix and

577
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:14,544
how they would connect to the existing elements that were

578
00:30:14,544 --> 00:30:15,305
already there.

579
00:30:15,305 --> 00:30:18,747
And then, of course, there's tons of variation and there's

580
00:30:18,747 --> 00:30:19,968
tons of balancing.

581
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:22,910
How you go a little bit too far, you end up with a

582
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,910
science fiction game.

583
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:26,102
If it's not there at all, it's barely noticeable

584
00:30:26,102 --> 00:30:28,063
and it doesn't really have any big impact.

585
00:30:28,063 --> 00:30:30,383
So over time, we managed to basically get this sort of

586
00:30:30,383 --> 00:30:33,525
final result that we felt basically was both authentic

587
00:30:33,525 --> 00:30:36,086
to the culture, but also created a distinct look

588
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:36,986
for the world of Horizon.

589
00:30:36,986 --> 00:30:41,948
Now, so through this technique of intrinsic de-identification

590
00:30:41,948 --> 00:30:44,149
we managed to create quite a wide variety

591
00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:45,109
of different cultures.

592
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:48,191
Cultures that were all very distinct from each other

593
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:51,052
and it all fitted with the environments of the tribes

594
00:30:51,052 --> 00:30:53,833
and it gave Horizon a very unique and visual identity.

595
00:30:55,070 --> 00:31:19,279
So the next thing that I'm going to show is one of her trailers where we show a little bit more of the tribes.

596
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,443
When they told me to raise you, I didn't ask questions.

597
00:31:29,443 --> 00:31:31,044
Why am I an outcast?

598
00:31:31,044 --> 00:31:32,705
Who was my mother?

599
00:31:32,705 --> 00:31:35,287
Always you pushed for answers.

600
00:31:35,287 --> 00:31:36,808
Push yourself.

601
00:31:46,615 --> 00:31:51,956
Here in the valley, we may be outcasts, but it's safe.

602
00:31:51,956 --> 00:31:56,597
Out there, girl, you'll be lost.

603
00:31:56,597 --> 00:32:00,818
You are nowhere to turn, or who to trust.

604
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:07,380
You'll be chasing a riddle into a wilderness of mysteries.

605
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:12,821
The world of the Old Ones.

606
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:20,879
What secrets lie buried beneath their crumbling ruins?

607
00:32:20,879 --> 00:32:23,782
Why Earth is ours no more.

608
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:44,560
These questions, Aloy, the tribe has forbidden.

609
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:50,802
What if the answers are worse than not knowing?

610
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,563
You can help.

611
00:32:53,563 --> 00:32:56,684
Or you can get out of my way.

612
00:32:56,684 --> 00:33:01,806
Then be ready for the darkness.

613
00:33:01,806 --> 00:33:03,267
And be careful.

614
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:04,867
What you bring to light...

615
00:33:12,045 --> 00:33:18,350
How do you know it won't bite back?

616
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:26,658
Outcast! You came from nothing. You will die a nothing.

617
00:33:26,658 --> 00:33:30,481
I came from somewhere.

618
00:33:30,481 --> 00:33:33,064
Identity confirmed.

619
00:33:33,064 --> 00:33:35,726
Even if it destroys me.

620
00:33:39,205 --> 00:33:41,326
I will see this through.

621
00:33:41,326 --> 00:33:42,706
Okay, let's get back to the robot dinosaurs.

622
00:33:42,706 --> 00:33:46,928
So when we started the design of our machines,

623
00:33:46,928 --> 00:33:49,289
our inspiration started with the types of machines

624
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:53,951
that we had designed for Killzone.

625
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:56,032
Military, industrial design,

626
00:33:56,032 --> 00:34:01,175
clearly machines that were designed for war and destruction.

627
00:34:01,175 --> 00:34:04,216
Something that would be very alien,

628
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:06,737
something unnatural, sort of like monsters of war.

629
00:34:08,508 --> 00:34:11,130
And we played around with the idea of making them half broken.

630
00:34:11,130 --> 00:34:15,253
They're a thousand years old, so robot zombie monsters.

631
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:21,038
Playing with things like strange way of movement and locomotion,

632
00:34:21,038 --> 00:34:23,901
so sort of like nightmare creatures.

633
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:27,343
Now, we were still using a version of intrinsic ideation.

634
00:34:27,343 --> 00:34:29,745
And one of the things that we started to emulate

635
00:34:29,745 --> 00:34:31,687
was how military design firms work.

636
00:34:31,988 --> 00:34:34,091
when they approach a design challenge like this.

637
00:34:34,091 --> 00:34:36,333
So we even role-played that a little bit,

638
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,415
that process of making the type of commercials

639
00:34:38,415 --> 00:34:40,617
that you typically see with military contractors

640
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:43,340
and what they would produce.

641
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,662
So usually, they tend to be very gung-ho,

642
00:34:45,662 --> 00:34:47,564
look at our cool system thing.

643
00:34:47,564 --> 00:34:50,627
So here's one of the movies that our team

644
00:34:50,627 --> 00:34:53,790
made to sell their initial idea of what

645
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:54,851
the robots could look like.

646
00:34:57,097 --> 00:35:02,760
When you invest in a GDLS vehicle, you know your investment is a sound one.

647
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,782
And that investment extends well past the date your vehicle is delivered,

648
00:35:06,782 --> 00:35:09,504
because you have the assurance that Through Life Support,

649
00:35:09,504 --> 00:35:14,707
one of the premier product support programs in the industry, is behind you.

650
00:35:14,707 --> 00:35:17,488
A program you won't find anywhere else.

651
00:35:17,488 --> 00:35:22,891
Because keeping you mission ready is what GDLS Customer Support is all about.

652
00:35:26,906 --> 00:35:30,128
I think this inspired our narrative team a little bit,

653
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,210
Becky, about FIRO Industries.

654
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,952
But the thing is, Becky, that this didn't work at all.

655
00:35:35,952 --> 00:35:39,215
We made some of these prototypes.

656
00:35:39,215 --> 00:35:41,156
And what we found, Becky, was that the emotional core

657
00:35:41,156 --> 00:35:42,837
experience was just completely off.

658
00:35:44,317 --> 00:35:50,341
So, when we look back at one of the pillars, it told us something really important about the core experience.

659
00:35:50,341 --> 00:35:52,342
And that it was about hunting.

660
00:35:52,342 --> 00:35:55,384
And fighting against these sort of robot monster zombies machines.

661
00:35:55,384 --> 00:35:57,706
It didn't make you feel like a fighter, like a hunter.

662
00:35:57,706 --> 00:36:01,268
It made you feel like a warrior, like a soldier fighting in the world of Terminator.

663
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,743
And also it clashes with another pillar that we have.

664
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:07,825
The designs failed to come across as something

665
00:36:07,825 --> 00:36:09,727
that was a life form.

666
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:12,730
In fact, they came across as solar soulless machines.

667
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,552
So we decided to scrap everything

668
00:36:14,552 --> 00:36:16,293
and start from scratch.

669
00:36:16,293 --> 00:36:18,155
So we needed a design for the machines

670
00:36:18,155 --> 00:36:21,498
that enabled our players to feel like hunters.

671
00:36:21,498 --> 00:36:24,061
And at the same time, maybe that they needed to feel alive

672
00:36:24,061 --> 00:36:25,382
and they needed to feel the dominating.

673
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,402
So maybe it was time to look back at another point in time

674
00:36:30,402 --> 00:36:33,663
where there was actually another dominant life form.

675
00:36:33,663 --> 00:36:35,825
And sure, when somebody suggested,

676
00:36:35,825 --> 00:36:38,186
let's turn all the machines into dinosaurs,

677
00:36:38,186 --> 00:36:39,687
a lot of people got very, very worried.

678
00:36:39,687 --> 00:36:44,089
Because this is sort of like the rule of cool, right?

679
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:45,290
This is a problem.

680
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,191
It's Vikings hunting robot dinosaurs.

681
00:36:47,191 --> 00:36:49,592
It's completely ridiculous.

682
00:36:49,592 --> 00:36:52,934
But still sort of reductantly, we decided to try it out

683
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:55,855
and just see what it would look like and feel like from a

684
00:36:55,855 --> 00:36:56,736
concept art point of view.

685
00:36:57,886 --> 00:37:00,748
And then, as it happened, something started to happen.

686
00:37:00,748 --> 00:37:03,470
None of these things made intellectually any sense,

687
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,871
but the imagery that we created worked emotionally.

688
00:37:05,871 --> 00:37:08,833
This whole silly idea of a primitive mankind

689
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:11,635
hunting high-tech megafauna just clicked.

690
00:37:11,635 --> 00:37:13,596
And everybody got very inspired,

691
00:37:13,596 --> 00:37:16,277
and it just tapped this treasure trove of ideas.

692
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:19,279
It really perfectly encapsulated this feeling

693
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:21,060
of being a hunter of very dangerous prey.

694
00:37:22,724 --> 00:37:25,846
By using familiar shapes, such as the famous T-Rex,

695
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:29,368
everybody immediately understood their relationship to it.

696
00:37:29,368 --> 00:37:32,270
If something really big and dangerous stands in front of you,

697
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,371
maybe you understand that it's dangerous,

698
00:37:34,371 --> 00:37:35,732
but you don't need to explain it

699
00:37:35,732 --> 00:37:38,394
through complex animations or backstories.

700
00:37:38,394 --> 00:37:41,315
So it might have created some level of intellectual confusion,

701
00:37:41,315 --> 00:37:43,977
but the emotional clarity was there.

702
00:37:43,977 --> 00:37:46,919
It was sort of like an extra interesting juxtaposition.

703
00:37:49,224 --> 00:37:52,584
There was a lot of concern about the ideas of robot animals.

704
00:37:52,584 --> 00:37:56,605
Maybe it was a little bit too strange, a little bit too alienating for our audience to accept.

705
00:37:56,605 --> 00:38:02,087
And thankfully, real life has some precedence in this whole notion, this idea.

706
00:38:02,087 --> 00:38:05,628
So these are of course making the famous movies from Boston Dynamics

707
00:38:05,628 --> 00:38:08,488
that make these robot dogs.

708
00:38:08,488 --> 00:38:09,268
They also always kick them.

709
00:38:09,268 --> 00:38:11,949
So if you're ever wondering, Maggie...

710
00:38:17,382 --> 00:38:22,325
Why the robot apocalypse happened? It's because of this guy.

711
00:38:22,325 --> 00:38:33,790
So there's this movement or they're making this philosophy in industrial design which

712
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:39,512
they call biomimetic design. And it's an industrial design philosophy that carefully looks at

713
00:38:39,512 --> 00:38:41,833
nature to solve certain engineering issues.

714
00:38:42,443 --> 00:38:44,303
So the notion behind this philosophy

715
00:38:44,303 --> 00:38:47,004
is that if you have millions and millions and millions

716
00:38:47,004 --> 00:38:49,325
of years of evolution, the solutions that

717
00:38:49,325 --> 00:38:51,706
tend to come out of that are very highly efficient

718
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:53,267
solutions.

719
00:38:53,267 --> 00:38:55,387
A famous example of this biomedic design

720
00:38:55,387 --> 00:38:57,328
is a problem that Japanese engineers

721
00:38:57,328 --> 00:39:00,509
had when they tried to solve the famous bullet trains.

722
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:02,230
Now, when they first made these things,

723
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,230
they would send them into tunnels.

724
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,831
And the moment that they hit the tunnel, there

725
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:07,831
would be these air pressure events which literally

726
00:39:07,831 --> 00:39:10,132
ripped the whole train apart.

727
00:39:10,132 --> 00:39:11,753
And that's bad for passengers.

728
00:39:13,044 --> 00:39:14,924
So they were looking for a solution,

729
00:39:14,924 --> 00:39:17,406
and they got their inspiration from the beak

730
00:39:17,406 --> 00:39:18,947
shape of the kingfisher.

731
00:39:18,947 --> 00:39:20,708
Because this is a bird that, once it

732
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:24,209
hits the water to catch a fish, it almost makes no splash.

733
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:26,871
So this is a perfect sort of evolution

734
00:39:26,871 --> 00:39:30,232
that created the shape, the most efficient form

735
00:39:30,232 --> 00:39:31,733
of hydrodynamics.

736
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:33,914
And once they took that shape and put it

737
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:36,576
on top of these trains, the trains didn't fall apart.

738
00:39:36,576 --> 00:39:37,977
And people were happy.

739
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,141
Now there's other versions of biomimetic designs as well.

740
00:39:42,141 --> 00:39:45,523
Maybe on your flight in, you took a look out of the window

741
00:39:45,523 --> 00:39:47,324
and you saw, maybe, these strange ailerons

742
00:39:47,324 --> 00:39:48,265
on the tips of airplane flames.

743
00:39:48,265 --> 00:39:50,126
Well, this is sort of where they come from, maybe.

744
00:39:50,126 --> 00:39:52,587
It's something, maybe, that birds of prey

745
00:39:52,587 --> 00:39:54,788
has as well, because it reduces drag,

746
00:39:54,788 --> 00:39:58,710
because it does something strange with the turbulence.

747
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:58,770
So.

748
00:39:59,414 --> 00:40:00,695
When we were designing with the tribes,

749
00:40:00,695 --> 00:40:02,377
we talked to a lot of anthropologists

750
00:40:02,377 --> 00:40:04,600
and we figured it might be interesting

751
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,041
to talk to engineers,

752
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:08,885
engineers who are working in robotics.

753
00:40:08,885 --> 00:40:10,607
So we went to the Technical University in Delft,

754
00:40:10,607 --> 00:40:11,628
which is local to us.

755
00:40:11,628 --> 00:40:14,831
And not only did they confirm, maybe,

756
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:17,454
that indeed biomimetics is a large, large part

757
00:40:17,454 --> 00:40:18,375
of modern robotics.

758
00:40:18,897 --> 00:40:23,482
But they were also using algorithms that mimic this process of evolutionary design itself.

759
00:40:23,482 --> 00:40:28,446
So they would create a design and then have it cross-breed it with successful versions

760
00:40:28,446 --> 00:40:31,689
of itself until it would converge to the most efficient designs.

761
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:37,455
And you get some really interesting things out of it, because they look very oddly organic.

762
00:40:37,455 --> 00:40:42,319
So it's not really art imitating life, it's art imitating technology that's imitating life.

763
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:50,342
So it seems very logical that our very advanced robots would sort of converge to the shapes

764
00:40:50,342 --> 00:40:51,943
that we see in nature as well.

765
00:40:51,943 --> 00:40:56,905
If you think about it, wheels could have evolved in nature, but only if roads would have been

766
00:40:56,905 --> 00:40:59,326
a naturally occurring feature as well.

767
00:40:59,326 --> 00:41:03,467
But in a world where you only have mountains and tree stumps lying around, it makes a lot

768
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:04,708
more sense to make it have legs.

769
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,747
We also basically asked them if nature could be improved upon.

770
00:41:08,747 --> 00:41:15,956
Are there any design mistakes or evolutionary processes that didn't go to the most optimal form?

771
00:41:15,956 --> 00:41:18,298
Are there any sub-optimal solutions in nature?

772
00:41:18,925 --> 00:41:21,667
And they explain that internal skeletons is one,

773
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:22,568
if you think about it.

774
00:41:22,568 --> 00:41:25,530
So all the soft tissue is on the outside,

775
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:27,271
and then your hardest part is on the inside.

776
00:41:27,271 --> 00:41:28,632
This doesn't really make a lot of sense,

777
00:41:28,632 --> 00:41:30,094
because it's just too fragile.

778
00:41:30,094 --> 00:41:32,095
And also, if you break one arm, that's done.

779
00:41:32,095 --> 00:41:34,217
In nature, that's pretty much game over.

780
00:41:34,217 --> 00:41:34,757
You're dead.

781
00:41:34,757 --> 00:41:38,560
So why put all this soft, vulnerable tissue

782
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,622
on the outside, and then create these sort

783
00:41:40,622 --> 00:41:42,303
of single points of failure?

784
00:41:42,303 --> 00:41:44,625
Is there a better solution for that?

785
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:46,227
Yes, nature has better solutions for that.

786
00:41:47,342 --> 00:41:49,744
So exoskeletons, basically, are much more sturdier.

787
00:41:49,744 --> 00:41:52,386
You have the protective aspects on the outside.

788
00:41:52,386 --> 00:41:54,608
It's just, you know, if humans would look like this,

789
00:41:54,608 --> 00:41:56,850
they would be a lot less attractive to each other,

790
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,391
I guess.

791
00:41:58,391 --> 00:42:02,114
And so we started to use these concepts of biomimetics,

792
00:42:02,114 --> 00:42:06,558
artificial pneumatic muscles, algorithmically generated

793
00:42:06,558 --> 00:42:09,881
reinforcements and exoskeletons, and started

794
00:42:09,881 --> 00:42:12,383
exploring a look that would make these machines believable.

795
00:42:14,018 --> 00:42:16,080
But it's not just about the efficiency of the biomechanics

796
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,842
that influence the shape of living things.

797
00:42:18,842 --> 00:42:21,864
Often, a creature's niche in an ecosystem

798
00:42:21,864 --> 00:42:24,085
is also what drives these evolutionary processes

799
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:26,867
that adopt certain shapes and behaviors.

800
00:42:26,867 --> 00:42:30,149
And we wanted to show a large variety of different machines,

801
00:42:30,149 --> 00:42:32,811
each with clear and distinct shapes and behaviors

802
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:34,552
that were coherent to the function

803
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,494
that they would have in our ecosystem and in our game.

804
00:42:37,494 --> 00:42:39,855
So one of the first ones that we tried to design

805
00:42:39,855 --> 00:42:41,336
were the Watchers,

806
00:42:41,336 --> 00:42:43,818
and they would be the guard dogs of our ecosystem.

807
00:42:45,147 --> 00:42:49,871
This was a sort of class of machine that would function as walking alarm bells in terms of the game design.

808
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:55,596
And one of the things that we found out is that we could actually change the shape of these creatures quite a lot

809
00:42:55,596 --> 00:42:57,638
and still communicate what they were to do.

810
00:42:57,638 --> 00:43:03,103
They didn't literally need to be dogs or meerkats to communicate their function.

811
00:43:03,103 --> 00:43:07,808
So one of our designers proposed this idea of making a snake on legs.

812
00:43:08,363 --> 00:43:10,885
So it would be able to run really fast on two legs,

813
00:43:10,885 --> 00:43:12,206
but then maybe if it needed to look,

814
00:43:12,206 --> 00:43:14,007
maybe it could just maybe sort of slide up its tail

815
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:16,368
and look above things.

816
00:43:16,368 --> 00:43:19,210
So yeah, a snake that's able to stand on the tip of its tail.

817
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:20,670
Now the key thing to get this to work,

818
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:23,692
because it would be not really a known creature,

819
00:43:23,692 --> 00:43:26,214
would be to get the behavior right.

820
00:43:26,214 --> 00:43:27,314
Because if we got that right,

821
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:29,155
we figured that the audience might be able to

822
00:43:29,155 --> 00:43:31,717
understand them and see them as something beyond a machine.

823
00:43:31,717 --> 00:43:33,538
So we see them as something like a living creature.

824
00:43:35,423 --> 00:43:40,147
Now here's a movie that I have, maybe that shows a little bit, maybe about the first prototype

825
00:43:40,147 --> 00:43:43,629
and actually the first animated robot that we had in the game.

826
00:43:43,629 --> 00:43:46,511
So this is almost six years old, six years ago.

827
00:43:46,511 --> 00:43:48,672
And it shows the first watches that we had.

828
00:43:48,672 --> 00:43:53,015
And maybe when we had this, maybe we knew that we could make any game that we, any robot that we had.

829
00:43:53,015 --> 00:43:53,555
Oh, it's not playing.

830
00:43:53,555 --> 00:44:03,922
Yes, Horizon was called at some point.

831
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,755
So this proved to us that this was the way forward.

832
00:44:25,755 --> 00:44:27,677
Not only did our robots feel alive,

833
00:44:27,677 --> 00:44:29,679
but you could even empathize with them.

834
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:31,740
You could understand their behavior.

835
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,503
You could sort of, by the way that they communicated,

836
00:44:34,503 --> 00:44:38,146
you could anticipate what they want, what they were for.

837
00:44:38,146 --> 00:44:40,488
And also, it made you feel like a hunter.

838
00:44:40,488 --> 00:44:42,470
You were studying these things.

839
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:43,951
You could study your prey and understand it.

840
00:44:46,038 --> 00:44:48,679
So that sort of made the decision for us.

841
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:51,380
So we were thankfully able to rationalize

842
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,002
our intellectual disbeliever way

843
00:44:54,002 --> 00:44:56,163
and align it with the emotional clarity that we felt

844
00:44:56,163 --> 00:44:58,664
when we first started thinking about robot dinosaurs.

845
00:44:58,664 --> 00:45:01,605
So our cognitive dissonance was resolved

846
00:45:01,605 --> 00:45:02,726
and the crisis was averted.

847
00:45:02,726 --> 00:45:05,267
And that was time to basically codify that

848
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:06,767
into the DNA of Horizon.

849
00:45:06,767 --> 00:45:09,569
So at that point, it became about animalistic machines.

850
00:45:09,569 --> 00:45:11,650
Let's take another look at a movie,

851
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:14,111
that shows these things a little bit more.

852
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:30,251
from the perspective of the game.

853
00:45:43,242 --> 00:45:57,618
Sorry, little one. I couldn't let you call for help.

854
00:45:57,618 --> 00:46:00,561
Perfect day for a hunt.

855
00:46:11,816 --> 00:46:20,605
This is going to be harder than I thought.

856
00:46:20,605 --> 00:46:28,753
Okay, those canisters should be full by now.

857
00:46:28,753 --> 00:46:29,454
Just a couple more.

858
00:46:47,412 --> 00:46:51,996
Oh, someone's angry!

859
00:46:51,996 --> 00:46:58,041
Gotta get under it.

860
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:51,012
Stay still!

861
00:47:51,012 --> 00:47:53,394
All right.

862
00:47:53,394 --> 00:48:00,458
Time to shut you down!

863
00:48:28,043 --> 00:48:30,805
The stories don't tell where the old ones went.

864
00:48:30,805 --> 00:48:37,490
They don't tell us why the machines rule these lands.

865
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:39,851
But they warn us...

866
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:41,392
that this balance cannot last.

867
00:48:41,392 --> 00:48:51,599
The storm is coming.

868
00:48:58,258 --> 00:49:01,981
And I will be ready.

869
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:05,844
So a quick pro tip, if you're ever

870
00:49:05,844 --> 00:49:08,627
making a three-minute long trailer against an unscripted

871
00:49:08,627 --> 00:49:10,729
AI creature, take your time.

872
00:49:10,729 --> 00:49:12,590
This took us about 160 takes to get it right.

873
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:19,736
So arguably, we could now design any machine that we wanted.

874
00:49:19,736 --> 00:49:21,958
But we still felt it would be better

875
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:24,200
to stay with existing or extinct creatures.

876
00:49:24,894 --> 00:49:29,036
We felt maybe that it gives a way for the player to anticipate the machine's behavior a little bit more.

877
00:49:29,036 --> 00:49:32,378
Because if it looks like a giant T-Rex, it's probably going to act like a giant T-Rex.

878
00:49:32,378 --> 00:49:36,640
So, for example, we designed our version of a terror bird.

879
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,422
This is a bird that lived about 10,000 years ago in South America and it hunted horses.

880
00:49:41,422 --> 00:49:42,123
How cool is that?

881
00:49:45,057 --> 00:49:46,517
So we had our visual style defined.

882
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:48,717
And it actually is now quite easy to come up

883
00:49:48,717 --> 00:49:50,458
with what the look of a machine would be.

884
00:49:50,458 --> 00:49:52,998
But it's often unclear on how it would move.

885
00:49:52,998 --> 00:49:54,539
And it would be even harder to imagine,

886
00:49:54,539 --> 00:49:56,059
maybe, how it would attack.

887
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,719
So for example, how would a terror bird attack?

888
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:01,020
You would figure, maybe, like, oh, it has a giant beak.

889
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,420
So it's probably uses its beak.

890
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,841
Now, there is this aspect from paleontology

891
00:50:06,841 --> 00:50:09,142
where they tend to study sort of.

892
00:50:09,536 --> 00:50:12,078
contemporary relative of extinct creatures and then

893
00:50:12,078 --> 00:50:13,259
theorize their behaviors of it.

894
00:50:13,259 --> 00:50:16,903
So roosters are sort of like contemporary mini-me versions

895
00:50:16,903 --> 00:50:18,164
of terror birds.

896
00:50:18,164 --> 00:50:25,951
And they do this when they attack.

897
00:50:25,951 --> 00:50:28,994
They're actually quite nasty.

898
00:50:28,994 --> 00:50:31,836
So you see how they sort of wait for you to turn and then

899
00:50:31,836 --> 00:50:32,757
attack you in the butt.

900
00:50:37,771 --> 00:50:39,654
So this inspired our game designers and animators

901
00:50:39,654 --> 00:50:41,217
to try something very familiar.

902
00:50:41,217 --> 00:50:43,320
And so this is the attack that ends up in the game,

903
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:46,285
sort of nature-inspiring, the attack sets in our game.

904
00:50:46,285 --> 00:50:50,892
And then ultimately, this is how it ends up in the game.

905
00:50:57,354 --> 00:51:01,376
So ultimately this design process enabled us to create a very large variety of very

906
00:51:01,376 --> 00:51:03,217
interesting and evocative creature designs.

907
00:51:03,217 --> 00:51:08,960
Covering everything from dinosaurs and other extinct creatures to bisons, wolves and giant

908
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:09,220
birds.

909
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:14,803
So the last thing that I'm going to show today, before we go to the Q&A, is one of our last

910
00:51:14,803 --> 00:51:15,263
trailers.

911
00:51:15,263 --> 00:51:20,605
This one was specifically created to communicate the concept of being a hunter and it shows

912
00:51:20,605 --> 00:51:22,066
off a lot of our machines in action.

913
00:51:24,765 --> 00:51:26,945
Let me tell you what's out there.

914
00:51:26,945 --> 00:51:33,868
Vast reaches of wilderness.

915
00:51:33,868 --> 00:51:34,108
Untamed.

916
00:51:34,108 --> 00:51:42,831
A rugged domain.

917
00:51:42,831 --> 00:51:47,012
Majestic, but lethal.

918
00:51:47,012 --> 00:51:50,614
It belongs to them.

919
00:51:50,614 --> 00:51:51,454
The machines.

920
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:56,639
Steal beasts who rule these lands.

921
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:05,603
And guard the secrets buried beneath its crumbling ruins.

922
00:52:05,603 --> 00:52:12,046
If you hunt these wilds, no matter how skilled you are, no matter how clever,

923
00:52:13,012 --> 00:52:15,574
You will become the Haunted.

924
00:52:15,574 --> 00:52:18,556
Can you brave that challenge?

925
00:52:18,556 --> 00:52:21,378
Can you pass that test?

926
00:52:21,378 --> 00:52:23,339
If you want to survive,

927
00:52:23,339 --> 00:52:26,461
you have to make the kill.

928
00:52:26,461 --> 00:52:31,524
Only then can you bring to light

929
00:52:31,524 --> 00:52:35,787
the deep secrets of the Earth.

930
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:57,270
And thank you very much.

931
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:57,370
Yeah.

932
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:57,490
Yeah.

933
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:57,590
Yeah.

934
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:57,750
Yeah.

935
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:58,811
Yeah.

936
00:52:58,811 --> 00:52:59,292
Yeah.

937
00:52:59,292 --> 00:52:59,512
Yeah.

938
00:52:59,512 --> 00:52:59,892
All right.

939
00:52:59,892 --> 00:53:01,213
Anybody has any questions?

940
00:53:01,213 --> 00:53:04,055
I think please step up to the microphone.

941
00:53:10,810 --> 00:53:12,672
I've got a question.

942
00:53:12,672 --> 00:53:13,032
Hello.

943
00:53:13,032 --> 00:53:13,332
Hi.

944
00:53:13,332 --> 00:53:15,474
As you're searching for new IP stuff,

945
00:53:15,474 --> 00:53:18,456
it looks like you had tens and tens of ideas up there.

946
00:53:18,456 --> 00:53:20,317
What was the morale of the team like while you're

947
00:53:20,317 --> 00:53:21,878
kind of wandering through the desert,

948
00:53:21,878 --> 00:53:24,520
sort of away from the safety of this known IP

949
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,841
that you guys have done for 10 years?

950
00:53:26,841 --> 00:53:29,523
In general, everybody was really excited.

951
00:53:29,523 --> 00:53:33,626
It's a once in a decade opportunity

952
00:53:33,626 --> 00:53:35,888
to start at the birth of a new IP.

953
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:38,952
So a lot of people were very interested in taking part

954
00:53:38,952 --> 00:53:39,113
of that.

955
00:53:39,113 --> 00:53:40,694
And of course, people get disappointed

956
00:53:40,694 --> 00:53:42,476
if their idea doesn't get picked.

957
00:53:42,476 --> 00:53:44,158
That's certainly a thing there.

958
00:53:44,158 --> 00:53:46,741
But in general, it's actually really good for morale.

959
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,621
Great presentation.

960
00:53:55,621 --> 00:53:58,842
So my question is whenever someone pitches the ideas,

961
00:53:58,842 --> 00:54:01,583
let's say you guys had 25 different ideas,

962
00:54:01,583 --> 00:54:03,924
I know there's hierarchy in the studio.

963
00:54:03,924 --> 00:54:08,726
There's level of how expert you are in your craft.

964
00:54:08,726 --> 00:54:12,288
But my question is whenever someone pitches it,

965
00:54:12,288 --> 00:54:15,149
how much are they in creative control throughout the?

966
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:21,138
like whole process or is this just the pitching idea and then it's the regular team.

967
00:54:21,138 --> 00:54:27,389
So yeah, you know people that pitch stay involved as stakeholders within it.

968
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,932
But of course, if you have

969
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:32,572
you know, a junior programmer making pitching a great idea,

970
00:54:32,572 --> 00:54:35,194
it doesn't necessarily mean that he has the skill sets

971
00:54:35,194 --> 00:54:37,975
to also maybe be the game director on the entire process

972
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:39,276
because that requires different skills.

973
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:42,859
So usually when this happens, people pitch the idea,

974
00:54:42,859 --> 00:54:45,220
but then maybe it gets taken over by the entire team

975
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:47,722
and there is more of a clear structure in place.

976
00:54:47,722 --> 00:54:48,202
Okay, cool.

977
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:48,502
Well, hello.

978
00:54:50,595 --> 00:54:54,377
It was a very interesting and in-depth presentation.

979
00:54:54,377 --> 00:54:56,718
It was really, really awesome to learn how,

980
00:54:56,718 --> 00:54:58,599
like how kind of like life itself

981
00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:01,540
influences into the designs, into the futuristic,

982
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:03,541
and into this juxtaposition of futuristic

983
00:55:03,541 --> 00:55:04,722
plus animalistic aesthetics.

984
00:55:04,722 --> 00:55:06,642
So I think that's really awesome.

985
00:55:06,642 --> 00:55:09,964
And my question was more about like the design pillars

986
00:55:09,964 --> 00:55:11,484
that the team uses at Guerrilla.

987
00:55:11,484 --> 00:55:14,626
Like do these design pillars are always changing

988
00:55:14,626 --> 00:55:16,907
or do they stay practically like the...

989
00:55:17,787 --> 00:55:20,790
like the same in almost all the developments of the of the

990
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:21,931
aesthetic of the game.

991
00:55:21,931 --> 00:55:26,875
So the theory is, or the idealistic presentation,

992
00:55:26,875 --> 00:55:29,477
that the pillars never change.

993
00:55:29,477 --> 00:55:32,920
Of course, they do slightly get tuned over time

994
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,181
to make it fit better.

995
00:55:34,181 --> 00:55:36,242
But they are our design bible.

996
00:55:36,242 --> 00:55:38,304
So preferably we don't like to touch them,

997
00:55:38,304 --> 00:55:40,846
because they are so core to our idea.

998
00:55:40,846 --> 00:55:41,887
OK, thank you.

999
00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:44,831
Hi.

1000
00:55:44,831 --> 00:55:48,372
So what I thought was really interesting

1001
00:55:48,372 --> 00:55:51,172
about the entire design process was

1002
00:55:51,172 --> 00:55:53,733
kind of the logical train of thought of, like, this

1003
00:55:53,733 --> 00:55:55,434
affects this, and this affects this.

1004
00:55:55,434 --> 00:56:01,495
And it seems like it almost takes, like,

1005
00:56:01,495 --> 00:56:04,956
the suspension of belief.

1006
00:56:04,956 --> 00:56:08,497
Like, it seemed to be really difficult to balance

1007
00:56:08,497 --> 00:56:11,798
the point in which you can.

1008
00:56:12,777 --> 00:56:22,148
you should stop the logic kind of aspect and then start adding like a ridiculous element

1009
00:56:22,148 --> 00:56:27,755
to your game. So what point would you say did you start thinking, oh, let's kind of like...

1010
00:56:30,684 --> 00:56:33,447
Well, that's kind of hard to say, Beghi.

1011
00:56:33,447 --> 00:56:36,751
You might be over-rationalizing things in certain cases,

1012
00:56:36,751 --> 00:56:39,974
where you stick too much to your established design process

1013
00:56:39,974 --> 00:56:42,737
and philosophies, and then you end up with something, Beghi,

1014
00:56:42,737 --> 00:56:43,998
that's missing something.

1015
00:56:43,998 --> 00:56:46,501
So in a lot of cases, Beghi, it's also gut instinct.

1016
00:56:46,501 --> 00:56:49,284
You have your sort of professional experience,

1017
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:52,547
and your gut instinct, and your own tastes and preferences,

1018
00:56:52,547 --> 00:56:53,628
Beghi, that you can fall back on.

1019
00:56:53,988 --> 00:56:55,689
But of course, those aren't necessarily

1020
00:56:55,689 --> 00:56:56,869
shared by the entire team.

1021
00:56:56,869 --> 00:56:58,910
So you then go into a process that's

1022
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:02,011
much more about convincing each other instead of sticking

1023
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:02,671
to the process.

1024
00:57:02,671 --> 00:57:05,512
It's difficult to say when exactly that needs to happen

1025
00:57:05,512 --> 00:57:08,393
or if there's a point where that needs to happen.

1026
00:57:08,393 --> 00:57:08,713
Thank you.

1027
00:57:08,713 --> 00:57:08,873
Hi.

1028
00:57:08,873 --> 00:57:10,834
First, this is one of my favorite games.

1029
00:57:10,834 --> 00:57:11,614
Oh, thank you.

1030
00:57:11,614 --> 00:57:17,576
Thank you so much for bringing it to us,

1031
00:57:17,576 --> 00:57:20,297
and thank you for this presentation.

1032
00:57:20,297 --> 00:57:22,718
My question is,

1033
00:57:23,851 --> 00:57:26,116
I'm curious as to, once you arrived at the...

1034
00:57:27,335 --> 00:57:30,755
the function and the design of these machines,

1035
00:57:30,755 --> 00:57:33,276
how did you work their purpose,

1036
00:57:33,276 --> 00:57:34,916
their narrative purpose into the story?

1037
00:57:34,916 --> 00:57:36,117
How did that affect their design?

1038
00:57:36,117 --> 00:57:36,977
How did that interact?

1039
00:57:36,977 --> 00:57:40,638
So it's something, maybe, that we always push,

1040
00:57:40,638 --> 00:57:42,638
so make sure, maybe, that they have a function

1041
00:57:42,638 --> 00:57:44,819
in their ecology, but in some cases,

1042
00:57:44,819 --> 00:57:46,459
maybe it's really hard to balance that, maybe,

1043
00:57:46,459 --> 00:57:49,100
with the design, maybe the combat design requirements.

1044
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,260
So it's something, maybe, that we want to do,

1045
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,601
but it doesn't always match.

1046
00:57:53,601 --> 00:57:54,941
So in a couple of cases, maybe,

1047
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:57,162
sort of like, well, it plays really well.

1048
00:57:57,602 --> 00:57:59,705
It doesn't make a lot of sense, but it plays really well.

1049
00:57:59,705 --> 00:58:00,667
So let's do it anyway.

1050
00:58:00,667 --> 00:58:05,194
You shouldn't make it stick to sort of idealistic to the idea

1051
00:58:05,194 --> 00:58:07,758
that it all has to make sense.

1052
00:58:07,758 --> 00:58:08,079
Thank you.

1053
00:58:12,914 --> 00:58:14,315
Thank you again for the talk.

1054
00:58:14,315 --> 00:58:16,437
It was very informative.

1055
00:58:16,437 --> 00:58:19,619
I was wondering, with all the creature designs,

1056
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:23,062
there's so much love and there's so much thought

1057
00:58:23,062 --> 00:58:25,984
into all of them, and with the rush of AAA production,

1058
00:58:25,984 --> 00:58:29,026
I was wondering if processes like outsourcing

1059
00:58:29,026 --> 00:58:30,447
helped the core team just focus

1060
00:58:30,447 --> 00:58:31,808
and really bring out the best in those ideas,

1061
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:33,810
or how did that help with the core team?

1062
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:36,612
So, yeah, we do quite a lot of outsourcing.

1063
00:58:36,612 --> 00:58:39,754
Most of our cinematics are outsourced.

1064
00:58:39,754 --> 00:58:42,476
Almost all of our modeling and texturing is outsourced.

1065
00:58:44,234 --> 00:58:50,380
So it is, what we tend to do is stick to what we feel is our core business,

1066
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:53,002
which is designing games and developing games,

1067
00:58:53,002 --> 00:58:54,824
but not necessarily making art assets.

1068
00:58:54,824 --> 00:58:59,128
So there is an aspect there that by outsourcing certain aspects,

1069
00:58:59,128 --> 00:59:00,369
we can stay focused more.

1070
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:02,070
Wonderful. Thank you.

1071
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:03,792
One more question. I just noticed.

1072
00:59:03,792 --> 00:59:05,473
Is it one more question? Okay, one more question.

1073
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:09,773
Yeah, actually my question was sort of related.

1074
00:59:09,773 --> 00:59:12,896
I was wondering about the scope of the creatures,

1075
00:59:12,896 --> 00:59:16,399
because obviously this game is also your first attempt

1076
00:59:16,399 --> 00:59:18,620
at the open world, so there was quite a lot of problems

1077
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:21,843
to figure out there on this side as well.

1078
00:59:21,843 --> 00:59:24,865
There is so many creatures in the game,

1079
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:27,187
and they're all kind of different.

1080
00:59:27,187 --> 00:59:29,469
I wanted to know about how did you decide,

1081
00:59:29,469 --> 00:59:32,872
and when, with design obviously, because they probably

1082
00:59:32,872 --> 00:59:34,773
required some stuff from you guys as well.

1083
00:59:35,554 --> 00:59:36,814
Like, how did it work?

1084
00:59:36,814 --> 00:59:41,335
Like, did they give you a list of types of enemies?

1085
00:59:41,335 --> 00:59:43,216
Or like, how did you guys solve that?

1086
00:59:43,216 --> 00:59:45,397
And then, obviously, how did you scope that?

1087
00:59:45,397 --> 00:59:47,597
Because it's ridiculous, like, the amount of stuff.

1088
00:59:47,597 --> 00:59:48,978
Very good question.

1089
00:59:48,978 --> 00:59:50,438
Eric, our lead designer,

1090
00:59:50,438 --> 00:59:52,639
I think we'll be having a whole talk about that.

1091
00:59:55,042 --> 00:59:57,944
But yeah, it's difficult. These things are very expensive.

1092
00:59:57,944 --> 00:59:59,544
They take a lot of time to work or to make.

1093
00:59:59,544 --> 01:00:02,726
The Thunderjaw in itself was an 18-month process,

1094
01:00:02,726 --> 01:00:04,807
from concept to full delivery.

1095
01:00:04,807 --> 01:00:08,848
At some point, you get all the ingredients together,

1096
01:00:08,848 --> 01:00:10,989
and then it becomes really easy to make things.

1097
01:00:10,989 --> 01:00:13,150
Once you've got all your mechanics there,

1098
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:14,871
once your design structure is there,

1099
01:00:14,871 --> 01:00:16,792
it becomes a lot easier.

1100
01:00:16,792 --> 01:00:19,593
But in the initial phases, it's very murderous to go

1101
01:00:19,593 --> 01:00:20,533
through those processes.

1102
01:00:21,086 --> 01:00:23,628
Yeah, it was like that demo that you showed there.

1103
01:00:23,628 --> 01:00:27,030
It was very interesting, because it's, I think, very

1104
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:30,833
rare to see that in E3 demos or whatnot, that the scope of

1105
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:35,216
the demo is much more on the character and the tech and the

1106
01:00:35,216 --> 01:00:39,119
animation and the systems than the usual environment art.

1107
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:40,580
The actual environment is not that big.

1108
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:41,540
Yeah.

1109
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:42,461
Thank you very much.

1110
01:00:42,461 --> 01:00:43,642
Thank you.

1111
01:00:43,642 --> 01:00:44,423
So thanks, everybody.

1112
01:00:44,423 --> 01:00:45,643
Hope you enjoyed it.
