1
00:00:04,283 --> 00:00:04,663
All right.

2
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:07,424
Good morning, everybody.

3
00:00:07,464 --> 00:00:08,585
Thanks so much for being here.

4
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:11,866
I'm excited to talk about two of my favorite things today,

5
00:00:12,106 --> 00:00:13,147
the brain and video games.

6
00:00:13,767 --> 00:00:15,608
Although I admit I was excited about video games

7
00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:18,329
way younger than I got excited by neuroscience and psychology.

8
00:00:19,009 --> 00:00:20,510
But anyway, my name is Celia Hodent.

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,171
A quick description of my background.

10
00:00:23,011 --> 00:00:24,613
I've got a PhD in psychology.

11
00:00:25,053 --> 00:00:26,935
I was a researcher in child development.

12
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:29,477
I researched how toddlers learn about arithmetics.

13
00:00:30,218 --> 00:00:32,180
I started to work at VTech 10 years ago

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,442
to create educational toys and video games.

15
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:37,545
I joined Ubisoft HQ in 2008,

16
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:39,527
where I developed a training session

17
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:40,729
called How Does the Brain Learn

18
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:43,271
for designers, artists, and gameplay programmers.

19
00:00:44,203 --> 00:00:47,766
I was transferred to Ubisoft Montreal to work on UX for Rainbow Six.

20
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:53,412
Then I joined LucasArts, where I developed UX practices until, well, I couldn't anymore.

21
00:00:54,273 --> 00:00:59,337
And I've been at Epic Games for nearly two years now, developing UX practices for the studio.

22
00:01:00,278 --> 00:01:06,004
So the content of this presentation is a mix from academic theories, Ubisoft Design Academy training,

23
00:01:06,444 --> 00:01:09,427
interaction with many, many game developers throughout my journey.

24
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:15,652
So user experience in the gaming industry is getting trendy.

25
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:17,854
So are psychology and neuroscience.

26
00:01:18,594 --> 00:01:19,855
But what does it mean, really?

27
00:01:20,176 --> 00:01:20,896
How to do it right?

28
00:01:21,277 --> 00:01:21,937
Where to start?

29
00:01:22,538 --> 00:01:23,979
How to know when progress is made?

30
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:26,701
What is the key brain knowledge that you really need

31
00:01:26,882 --> 00:01:28,163
and that you can apply to your game?

32
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:30,505
But most of all, why does it matter?

33
00:01:31,165 --> 00:01:33,647
Why knowing about the brain can help you develop video games

34
00:01:33,848 --> 00:01:36,030
when, for many of you, you've been doing it for years?

35
00:01:38,467 --> 00:01:40,368
So before we get into the depth of the subject,

36
00:01:41,948 --> 00:01:44,089
let's look at a classic test in psychology

37
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,370
designed to understand how the brain reasons.

38
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:48,331
So here are four cards.

39
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:50,813
Each of them has a letter on one side

40
00:01:51,013 --> 00:01:52,433
and a number on the other side.

41
00:01:52,874 --> 00:01:55,095
Two of these cards are shown with the letter side up

42
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:57,036
and two with the number side up.

43
00:01:58,296 --> 00:01:59,777
So here's what you have to do.

44
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,600
You have to define which card are cards.

45
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,081
You need to turn over to determine whether the

46
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:06,242
following claim is true.

47
00:02:06,782 --> 00:02:10,743
If the card has an A on one side, then it has a 3 on the

48
00:02:10,783 --> 00:02:11,143
other side.

49
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:14,024
Take a few seconds to think about it.

50
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:18,946
All right, so how many of you think we need to

51
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,107
turn over A and 3?

52
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:22,948
Can you just give me a quick idea of how many of you think

53
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:24,188
we need to turn over A and 3?

54
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:25,789
All right.

55
00:02:26,109 --> 00:02:27,589
What about A only?

56
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,150
OK.

57
00:02:32,054 --> 00:02:37,939
So in deductive reasoning, an argument is invalid if the premise is true, so in that case A,

58
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:41,402
but the conclusion is false, so not 3.

59
00:02:42,122 --> 00:02:47,527
So to verify that, you need to turn over A to verify that there's a 3 on the outside.

60
00:02:48,207 --> 00:02:52,851
You do not need to turn over 3, as even if we found another letter behind it,

61
00:02:53,211 --> 00:02:54,572
it won't invalidate the argument.

62
00:02:55,193 --> 00:02:57,375
The same way that you do not need to turn over C.

63
00:02:58,016 --> 00:02:59,137
Lastly, you need to turn over 7

64
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:02,380
to verify that there's not an A behind it,

65
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,803
because then it would invalidate the argument.

66
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:09,595
So in Wazen's study, not even 10% of subjects

67
00:03:10,076 --> 00:03:12,276
found the correct solution, even though we all

68
00:03:12,336 --> 00:03:13,977
believe we have good logical skills.

69
00:03:14,437 --> 00:03:16,578
So if you found the correct solution, great job.

70
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:19,819
And this is not because the brain is stupid or not logical.

71
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,820
It's because the brain has evolved to recognize patterns

72
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:26,982
and find shortcuts because of that we survived so far.

73
00:03:27,722 --> 00:03:30,003
After all, the brain is very efficient for everyday tasks.

74
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,465
And the mistakes the brain makes are insignificant trade-offs

75
00:03:33,565 --> 00:03:34,745
in the scale of evolution.

76
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:39,507
However, as a game developer, this raises difficulties you must take into account

77
00:03:40,147 --> 00:03:42,147
if you want people to have a great experience playing your game.

78
00:03:42,828 --> 00:03:45,448
This is why you need to understand the gamer's brain and your own.

79
00:03:46,089 --> 00:03:49,630
That's what this talk is about, not telling game developers how to do their job.

80
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,910
You know that already.

81
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,891
It's about using neuroscience knowledge and user research methodology

82
00:03:55,191 --> 00:03:57,292
to constantly making you aware of these biases

83
00:03:57,672 --> 00:03:59,673
so you can make the best decisions for your game.

84
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:04,872
So you have to keep in mind that there's only so much workload the brain will tolerate.

85
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:10,917
The brain consumes 20% of the body's energy, although it makes up only 2% of a person's

86
00:04:10,957 --> 00:04:11,157
weight.

87
00:04:11,797 --> 00:04:15,680
So the workload in your game must be dedicated to the core experience you want to offer,

88
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:18,823
not in figuring out menus, for example, or icons.

89
00:04:19,443 --> 00:04:23,365
That's why defining your core pillars and sticking to this vision is crucial to have

90
00:04:23,405 --> 00:04:24,345
great user experience.

91
00:04:24,986 --> 00:04:27,847
Now always trade-offs to make, and perfection is hardly reachable.

92
00:04:28,427 --> 00:04:32,448
UX is about making sure the trade-offs make sense for the experience you intend.

93
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:36,976
That doesn't mean your game must not be difficult or have any challenges.

94
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:37,876
Quite the contrary.

95
00:04:38,356 --> 00:04:42,037
But the challenges must be about the core experience and nothing else.

96
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:45,678
Think about it as if playing golf with a green ball.

97
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:49,439
Might be spicing it up from some hardcore golfers, maybe.

98
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:52,900
But the golf experience is not about making it challenging to find the ball.

99
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,121
So here, I propose to talk about three important things

100
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:59,182
you need to know about the brain that can help you on a daily basis.

101
00:04:59,702 --> 00:05:02,083
Perception, memory, and attention.

102
00:05:04,024 --> 00:05:07,185
So whatever you do, watching a movie, listening to music,

103
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,206
playing a video game, your brain learns.

104
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:12,087
It makes new or reinforced synaptic connections.

105
00:05:12,908 --> 00:05:14,508
Anything the brain processes and learns

106
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:16,469
always comes from an input.

107
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:19,570
And in the end, it changes the memory of a subject.

108
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:21,891
And the quality of the processing

109
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:24,232
depends highly on the attentional resources applied,

110
00:05:24,613 --> 00:05:26,253
which are also dependent on the emotions

111
00:05:26,453 --> 00:05:27,634
and motivation felt.

112
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:29,535
Although I won't really have the time here

113
00:05:29,555 --> 00:05:31,115
to address emotions and motivation.

114
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:35,602
A little disclaimer, this is highly simplified,

115
00:05:36,362 --> 00:05:38,203
merely an overview with a few examples.

116
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:41,424
The brain is not working in buckets like that,

117
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:45,706
and making games is very complex, so is the brain.

118
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:49,768
But for communication's sake, and for the sake of a tired brain this morning,

119
00:05:50,608 --> 00:05:51,969
after all these parties and stuff,

120
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:55,790
I'll just for each bucket explain how it works in a nutshell,

121
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,011
point out the main limitations,

122
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:00,892
and give an example or two of how this knowledge applies to game.

123
00:06:03,202 --> 00:06:04,743
All right, let's start with perception.

124
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:08,625
So perception is not a passive window to the world.

125
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:11,867
Information is organized through a three-level process.

126
00:06:12,468 --> 00:06:14,909
I'm just going to take the example of vision,

127
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,270
because it's more visual.

128
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,131
But it's the same thing with all senses.

129
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:21,113
So it all starts with sensation.

130
00:06:21,393 --> 00:06:23,995
So if you look up at the skies at night, what you're going

131
00:06:24,015 --> 00:06:26,437
to see is the physics level.

132
00:06:26,837 --> 00:06:29,959
These are dots with a specific orientation, spatial

133
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:31,200
frequency, and brightness.

134
00:06:32,745 --> 00:06:35,727
The brain very quickly is going to organize the visual field.

135
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,908
This is the perception level.

136
00:06:38,688 --> 00:06:42,550
The brain is really heavily wired to recognize shapes and patterns.

137
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:45,852
So in that case, you're going to see a soft zone.

138
00:06:46,812 --> 00:06:51,075
The last level is the cognition level, access to semantics, knowledge.

139
00:06:51,415 --> 00:06:54,936
So if you know about that particular constellation, you will recognize Earth's major.

140
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:59,885
And we can believe that it's always going bottom up,

141
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:01,826
but actually very, very frequently,

142
00:07:01,846 --> 00:07:05,130
it's a top-down process, meaning that your knowledge

143
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,612
is actually going to influence the way you perceive things.

144
00:07:08,473 --> 00:07:10,115
I'm going to give you a little example here.

145
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:12,097
All right.

146
00:07:12,737 --> 00:07:13,658
What do you perceive here?

147
00:07:15,345 --> 00:07:15,985
Color stripes?

148
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:18,686
Street fighter characters?

149
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:23,147
So people who don't know about Street Fighter might just see

150
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:23,847
color stripes here.

151
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:26,007
And if you're a fan of the game, you might see something

152
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:26,387
different.

153
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:29,688
And here we are, all game developers and geeks, so a

154
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:32,769
fairly homogeneous and niche crowd, yet who might perceive

155
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:33,609
this image differently.

156
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:36,249
That's why it's important to know your audience, their

157
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,650
prior knowledge and expectations, and make sure

158
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:41,510
that what they perceive is actually what you intended.

159
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,373
And just like the black and blue dress that was very trendy on Twitter,

160
00:07:46,494 --> 00:07:48,976
different people are going to perceive reality differently

161
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,819
because perception is a product of your brain.

162
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,101
Also, if you're colorblind, you don't give a shit about this slide.

163
00:07:57,303 --> 00:07:59,845
About 10% of people have some sort of colorblindness

164
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:02,388
and they won't perceive this image the same way other people do.

165
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:04,069
Perception is subjective.

166
00:08:06,358 --> 00:08:07,999
So okay, perception is a product of the brain.

167
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:11,040
And here's an example of how you can use that knowledge

168
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,981
to make your head and maze easier for the brain to perceive.

169
00:08:14,981 --> 00:08:17,062
I'm gonna use an example from Gestalt theory,

170
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,943
it's a theory of fighter perception.

171
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:23,744
And they got some laws that are super useful

172
00:08:23,984 --> 00:08:26,285
for any UI stuff that you're doing.

173
00:08:26,785 --> 00:08:28,946
One of these laws is the law of proximity.

174
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:32,347
So objects that are near to one another in space or time

175
00:08:32,407 --> 00:08:34,008
are perceived as belonging together.

176
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:38,871
Like on the right, you're going to perceive small groups of items,

177
00:08:39,011 --> 00:08:42,013
whereas on the left, you perceive it as a big one, a massive block.

178
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:46,435
So if you apply it in games like, for example, League of Legends,

179
00:08:47,016 --> 00:08:49,337
if you look at the HUD here at the top,

180
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:51,518
the elements here are perceived to...

181
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:54,660
You don't need to have lines to separate these buckets

182
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,202
to understand that the number is tied to...

183
00:08:57,602 --> 00:09:00,164
Like the six is tied to the icon of the sword,

184
00:09:01,364 --> 00:09:02,465
because they're closer together.

185
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:05,777
Same thing with the novel law, the law of similarity.

186
00:09:06,277 --> 00:09:07,758
Objects with similar attributes,

187
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:09,759
with a shade, color, size, or brightness,

188
00:09:10,059 --> 00:09:11,320
are perceived as belonging together.

189
00:09:12,381 --> 00:09:14,242
So if we keep the same example from League,

190
00:09:14,982 --> 00:09:16,123
here when you look at minimap,

191
00:09:16,183 --> 00:09:17,844
you can easily perceive what goes together

192
00:09:17,884 --> 00:09:19,865
just based on the shapes and the colors.

193
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:27,924
All right, so here I'm going to use an example from Far Cry 3 of do's and don'ts using the gestalt nodes.

194
00:09:28,344 --> 00:09:30,406
And before I go on with that, just a precision here.

195
00:09:30,726 --> 00:09:32,668
It's easy to point out issues after the fact.

196
00:09:33,148 --> 00:09:36,111
I only take that example because I played a lot of that great game.

197
00:09:36,131 --> 00:09:38,893
And it's just illustrating my point in a great way.

198
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:42,296
And I know the Ubisoft people, so that's okay, right?

199
00:09:43,317 --> 00:09:47,998
Okay, so the good practice here is like here in the box,

200
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,559
all these elements that are close together

201
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:52,419
are belonging together.

202
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,040
So here you don't need to separate them.

203
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,361
You really understand that the money,

204
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:59,422
which part is the money, which part is the XP, et cetera.

205
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:02,923
So that's the law of proximity.

206
00:10:03,123 --> 00:10:04,803
Here they use the law of similarity

207
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:07,424
to show you that this is the points that you have

208
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:10,445
and this is the points that you need to buy this skill.

209
00:10:13,124 --> 00:10:16,988
A more, like a less good example is here.

210
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:20,951
So these are caramba points, and the diamond icon next to it

211
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:23,714
is part of this, yet it's a little bit farther away

212
00:10:23,774 --> 00:10:24,314
from the rest.

213
00:10:24,815 --> 00:10:27,677
So this can be weird because it's at the same distance

214
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:30,299
as the skill points that you have,

215
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,741
so it could be harder to perceive.

216
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:37,586
So also when you look at the skill tree,

217
00:10:37,746 --> 00:10:38,727
the first time that you look at it,

218
00:10:39,654 --> 00:10:44,638
you could easily perceive that actually the skill tree is organized in a vertical way

219
00:10:45,038 --> 00:10:50,362
because the icons are actually closer together on the vertical axis than on the horizontal axis.

220
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:55,866
So if we just pick that example of this skill tree.

221
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:02,570
And we replace the icons with my own made-up tokens.

222
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,831
We also add the little arrows.

223
00:11:05,052 --> 00:11:07,473
That actually is pretty hard to perceive in the game.

224
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:09,115
We remove the background.

225
00:11:09,675 --> 00:11:13,779
Okay, so here, according to the Gershat law of perception,

226
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:18,402
you are likely to just interpret that as a big bucket

227
00:11:18,562 --> 00:11:20,504
or maybe more as vertical lines

228
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:23,106
because it's slightly closer together on the vertical axis.

229
00:11:23,927 --> 00:11:26,548
Now if you just apply the Gestalt law of proximity,

230
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:28,289
you have a very low hanging fruit here,

231
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:29,390
by just doing that.

232
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,092
By using the same space

233
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:34,693
and applying the Gestalt law of proximity,

234
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:36,554
you place the icons on the horizontal line

235
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:37,354
close to each other,

236
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:38,795
you make the icons have a shape

237
00:11:38,815 --> 00:11:40,356
that infers movement toward the right,

238
00:11:40,836 --> 00:11:42,037
and you don't need the arrows anymore.

239
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:44,398
So sure, it's not a big deal,

240
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:46,019
and players won't do anything in the end,

241
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,400
but this is just a way to facilitate

242
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,981
the perception of that skill tree.

243
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:56,123
Another rule of perception that is really important to follow

244
00:11:56,404 --> 00:11:57,584
is the form follows function,

245
00:11:58,305 --> 00:11:59,446
and it's really important in design.

246
00:12:00,026 --> 00:12:01,447
Ideally, you want to reach affordance.

247
00:12:02,227 --> 00:12:03,448
What you see is how it works,

248
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:05,750
because the less information your audience

249
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,391
will have to remember about things that are not central

250
00:12:08,491 --> 00:12:10,993
to the experience you want to offer, again, the better.

251
00:12:11,854 --> 00:12:13,315
And if an icon doesn't speak by itself,

252
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:15,756
then the player first has to figure out what it means,

253
00:12:16,216 --> 00:12:16,937
then remember it,

254
00:12:17,597 --> 00:12:19,739
which won't be the case if the icon has affordance.

255
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:21,000
That's workload.

256
00:12:22,113 --> 00:12:24,513
So it's very hard to design icons, and in RPG games,

257
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:25,394
you need a ton of them.

258
00:12:25,974 --> 00:12:27,894
Conveyabilities are not obvious.

259
00:12:28,634 --> 00:12:30,475
Ideally, you want the form of your icons

260
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:32,075
to naturally convey its function,

261
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,416
and the same way for the majority of your audience.

262
00:12:35,156 --> 00:12:37,836
You also want to avoid multistability or ambiguity.

263
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:39,597
This is also coming from Gestalt.

264
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:42,778
Some things can be perceived differently

265
00:12:42,838 --> 00:12:43,918
by different people.

266
00:12:44,238 --> 00:12:46,578
So you might perceive here a rabbit or a duck.

267
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:48,459
So you want to avoid that.

268
00:12:49,547 --> 00:12:52,972
Again, yes, people will eventually figure it out, but for every little piece that needs

269
00:12:53,012 --> 00:12:56,697
to be learned, it takes some workload that could be used for something else.

270
00:12:57,237 --> 00:12:59,260
And what needs to be learned will need to be remembered.

271
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,465
And we'll see the problem with memory limitations later.

272
00:13:05,093 --> 00:13:07,095
So unless your game's all about playing with perception,

273
00:13:07,275 --> 00:13:09,516
like Monument Valley, you want your input

274
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,738
to be perceived easily and understood as designed.

275
00:13:12,718 --> 00:13:14,819
iPhone is still using icons representing

276
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:18,262
a stereotyped mental model we have for email and camera,

277
00:13:18,902 --> 00:13:20,403
even though this is not really

278
00:13:20,463 --> 00:13:21,544
how these things look like today.

279
00:13:22,264 --> 00:13:23,665
Same thing with the telephone icon.

280
00:13:23,945 --> 00:13:25,286
Like the phones we had don't look

281
00:13:25,306 --> 00:13:28,428
like the stereotyped icon we have on our phone.

282
00:13:29,535 --> 00:13:32,436
So the form you choose might not exactly be true to the reality,

283
00:13:32,836 --> 00:13:35,217
but rather true to the mental model people have.

284
00:13:36,518 --> 00:13:39,639
Seems easy and common knowledge, but look at the photos and game center icons.

285
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:43,781
This time it's totally abstract, so users have to learn and remember them.

286
00:13:44,501 --> 00:13:48,023
Also, these icons are very similar to each other, as well as the music and

287
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:50,704
iTunes sold ones, although have different functions,

288
00:13:51,044 --> 00:13:52,345
which makes it hard to differentiate.

289
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:58,536
So follow the FFF rule as much as possible

290
00:13:58,597 --> 00:13:59,579
to design your icons.

291
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,066
To maximize icons that are self-explanatory

292
00:14:03,246 --> 00:14:04,670
and don't need to be learned and memorized.

293
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,511
And test them.

294
00:14:06,403 --> 00:14:07,844
So here's how I've been doing it lately.

295
00:14:08,244 --> 00:14:09,805
And I will take an example from Fortnite.

296
00:14:10,525 --> 00:14:13,487
Fortnite is an action-building game with RPG elements.

297
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:16,748
So we have a lot of icons, like for class abilities,

298
00:14:16,788 --> 00:14:17,268
for example.

299
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:18,909
A little disclaimer here.

300
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,730
Fortnite is very, very early in development.

301
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,891
It's pre-alpha.

302
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:24,811
And most screenshots and footage you're

303
00:14:24,832 --> 00:14:26,032
going to see in this presentation

304
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:28,973
is coming from UX testing, so very low resolution.

305
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:37,829
So, we regularly take a list of icons and we ask our audience, or you can start by internal

306
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:41,415
people that have never seen your icons before, about their form and function.

307
00:14:43,093 --> 00:14:45,975
So to explain what you want from your participants,

308
00:14:46,236 --> 00:14:48,618
give an example on the first page of your survey.

309
00:14:50,239 --> 00:14:51,220
So you show that.

310
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,601
Here's an example of an icon.

311
00:14:52,661 --> 00:14:54,183
For each icon, you need to describe

312
00:14:54,263 --> 00:14:55,784
what does it look like, its form,

313
00:14:56,285 --> 00:14:58,647
and also what you believe it does in the game, its function.

314
00:14:59,468 --> 00:15:01,609
So in the example here, the form of the icon

315
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,932
is a heart with an EKJ graph inside.

316
00:15:04,332 --> 00:15:05,713
And for the function, it could be,

317
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:08,736
I expect using this ability would resuscitate my character.

318
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:15,495
So you give that example, and then you have, in your survey, one icon per page.

319
00:15:15,876 --> 00:15:19,359
So I just took a snapshot of the survey here.

320
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:24,884
And make sure the order is randomized, because otherwise you could have an effect of order.

321
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:28,567
Also make sure that the icons are about the size it will be in the game.

322
00:15:28,707 --> 00:15:33,551
So if it's going to be small on the screen, you don't want the icon to be huge in your survey.

323
00:15:35,304 --> 00:15:39,086
It's important to do this with a population sample that represents your core audience.

324
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:43,329
There might be cultural differences, for example, West versus Asia.

325
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,911
Again, that's why it's important to define who your core audience is.

326
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:51,693
Some codifications might work with hardcore gamers, but not with casual gamers.

327
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:54,475
Although, generalize usually what defines common knowledge.

328
00:15:54,735 --> 00:15:57,977
RPG versus FPS versus puzzle games, etc.

329
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:00,178
Remember the Street Fighter, Call of Stripes.

330
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,100
It's not necessarily about gender, age, or nationality.

331
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,701
It's more about common references.

332
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,624
Your ideal sample size would be 96, but let's face it,

333
00:16:10,684 --> 00:16:13,205
most of us can't really access that many people.

334
00:16:13,846 --> 00:16:16,527
So half of them can give you good enough insight

335
00:16:16,607 --> 00:16:18,449
without increasing too much a margin of error.

336
00:16:19,209 --> 00:16:20,490
If you're short on time and resources,

337
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,072
test it with less people anyway, it's still valuable.

338
00:16:23,752 --> 00:16:25,133
Just make sure the people you're asking

339
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:27,615
know about the genre of your game

340
00:16:27,915 --> 00:16:29,596
and that they haven't seen the icons before,

341
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,477
as you want to test how intuitive they are.

342
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:34,392
So before we analyze the results,

343
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:36,874
it's important that you as a designer design the icons

344
00:16:36,894 --> 00:16:37,754
to answer the survey.

345
00:16:38,254 --> 00:16:39,995
This will highlight even more the difference

346
00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:43,157
in perspectives, designer versus player, when it happens.

347
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:47,559
So here, this is one early icon in Fortnite that we tested.

348
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,240
At the size, it would appear on screen.

349
00:16:51,101 --> 00:16:54,002
And so the UI designer entered the survey.

350
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:56,323
So for the form, it's a smoke bomb

351
00:16:56,864 --> 00:16:58,024
releasing a plume of smoke.

352
00:16:58,765 --> 00:17:02,287
And the function of that is it throws a smoke bomb.

353
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,902
And so here are the results that we had.

354
00:17:05,922 --> 00:17:07,965
It's just a small sample of the results

355
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:10,128
because it takes too much space here.

356
00:17:10,588 --> 00:17:12,130
You do not need to read that all.

357
00:17:13,312 --> 00:17:14,754
But what you can look at it here,

358
00:17:14,774 --> 00:17:17,297
you can actually, unless again, you're colorblind,

359
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,862
you can very easily see where the problems are here.

360
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:28,805
So here we found that for the icon, the form here has only 60% rate of correct answers.

361
00:17:29,705 --> 00:17:33,786
And the problem here is not that they're completely wrong answers,

362
00:17:34,126 --> 00:17:40,287
but you have a lot of partially correct answers. Like people understood the bomb part of it,

363
00:17:40,547 --> 00:17:46,569
but they did not understand the smoke part. And so because of that, the functionality of

364
00:17:46,589 --> 00:17:49,910
this icon is not understood, because it's too ambiguous.

365
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:53,082
So in this case, the icon can be easily tweaked.

366
00:17:53,603 --> 00:17:55,344
It seems that only the smoke part is not understood,

367
00:17:55,484 --> 00:17:57,145
so you can just create this part.

368
00:17:58,366 --> 00:17:59,366
Let's take another example.

369
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:03,309
So here, the UI designer tells us

370
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:06,111
it's a bomb superimposed on an old-timey alarm clock.

371
00:18:07,091 --> 00:18:10,854
The function here is to deploy the matter collector,

372
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:14,116
which is actually destroying everything

373
00:18:14,256 --> 00:18:16,357
and all the materials come back to you,

374
00:18:17,058 --> 00:18:19,319
so you don't have to scavenge manually everything.

375
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,388
So that's a functionality.

376
00:18:21,608 --> 00:18:24,590
Again, as RPG elements, sometimes the functionalities

377
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,570
are super complex.

378
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:29,032
And here's what people entered.

379
00:18:30,893 --> 00:18:34,895
So this is an example when the form is working perfectly.

380
00:18:34,955 --> 00:18:37,257
People understood the form, but the functionality

381
00:18:37,297 --> 00:18:38,317
is completely off.

382
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:41,519
So this icon needs a complete redesign.

383
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:47,981
So the function of this icon is immediately very hard to convey.

384
00:18:48,282 --> 00:18:52,844
The designer tried something, of course he didn't have high hopes, but it's also good

385
00:18:52,864 --> 00:18:53,245
to try.

386
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:58,528
The idea behind the clock is that you gain time harvesting resources versus if you manually

387
00:18:58,568 --> 00:18:59,349
break all the stuff.

388
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,571
But people usually have a very different perspective about a clock.

389
00:19:03,011 --> 00:19:05,733
So at that point you really have to change the icon completely, not just tweak it.

390
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:10,396
And you might need to use an abstract icon if the function is too complex, so at least

391
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:11,457
it's not misleading.

392
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:15,961
You really don't want to mislead people.

393
00:19:16,361 --> 00:19:19,563
So reality over assets is not what is really important.

394
00:19:19,904 --> 00:19:22,866
What is important is how it's perceived by the majority of your audience.

395
00:19:23,907 --> 00:19:25,488
Let's take an audio example here.

396
00:19:26,008 --> 00:19:27,389
This is taken from The Dark Knight.

397
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:30,732
Listen to the bat cycle and think about how it sounds.

398
00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:43,915
Ooh, you want to play, come on.

399
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:44,415
Come on.

400
00:19:44,775 --> 00:19:45,456
Come on.

401
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:45,696
Come on.

402
00:19:45,716 --> 00:19:45,956
Come on.

403
00:19:45,996 --> 00:19:46,316
Come on.

404
00:19:47,717 --> 00:19:49,937
So it sounds like it's infinitely rising, right?

405
00:19:51,198 --> 00:19:53,159
What it is in reality is called the shepherd tone.

406
00:19:53,179 --> 00:20:01,762
So it's overlapping tones fading in at one end of the cycle and fading out at the other.

407
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:07,349
It's annoying.

408
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,312
So it's very different from what we hear, actually.

409
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:16,115
And this was a platinum game in Super Mario 64, for example.

410
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:21,279
So if you try to get to Bowser before you got 60 stars, this

411
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,239
is what's happening.

412
00:20:44,803 --> 00:20:46,885
This is our Nintendo messes up with our perception.

413
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:48,086
Shippa-toom.

414
00:20:49,867 --> 00:20:52,329
So when you test your game, be careful when

415
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:53,890
asking the players about their perceptions.

416
00:20:55,411 --> 00:20:57,032
For example, many players are perceiving

417
00:20:57,513 --> 00:21:00,455
the zombies in Fortnite difficult to aim at.

418
00:21:01,035 --> 00:21:03,657
And the overall impression that we had

419
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:05,659
was either because the zombies were too small

420
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,820
or maybe moving too fast.

421
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,502
And this is what they were answering the surveys.

422
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:15,326
So the animation team was wondering what was really causing issues players were having to target the enemies.

423
00:21:15,826 --> 00:21:19,368
So to test this question, we created a gym level about a shooting range.

424
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:23,151
It allowed us to test the variables in a standardized environment.

425
00:21:23,611 --> 00:21:26,973
The participants were told to do as many headshots as they could in one minute,

426
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:30,116
as the husks, the zombies, were auto-spawning.

427
00:21:30,476 --> 00:21:31,376
So here's the video of that.

428
00:21:32,797 --> 00:21:34,699
Three, two, one, go!

429
00:21:44,418 --> 00:21:48,740
So this is how we saw that the problem was not an animation one, nor a characterised one.

430
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,981
It was mainly due to the passing through.

431
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:57,363
Because they don't have a lot of problems aiming at the zombies very early on,

432
00:21:57,403 --> 00:22:02,405
but it's when they try to go around the obstacles that it's a problem.

433
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:06,941
So it's the rotational value in the pathing code that was too sharp.

434
00:22:07,462 --> 00:22:10,364
When the zombies go around an obstacle, it becomes very challenging to follow them

435
00:22:10,764 --> 00:22:13,926
because they do an instantaneous turn instead of a stop plan.

436
00:22:21,772 --> 00:22:25,295
So analyze what people are saying, don't necessarily take it for granted.

437
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:30,238
Then my hypothesis is to test them by controlling all other variables

438
00:22:30,258 --> 00:22:31,479
to find out what's really going on.

439
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:35,519
So this is it for the perception part.

440
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:38,380
So a little reminder here.

441
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,801
How it works in a nutshell is like input

442
00:22:40,821 --> 00:22:42,321
is processed by the brain.

443
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:45,543
The limitations, just a few examples,

444
00:22:45,643 --> 00:22:46,763
there are more limitations than that.

445
00:22:47,263 --> 00:22:50,665
But perception is different than reality.

446
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:53,025
And perception is subjective.

447
00:22:54,346 --> 00:22:56,607
Lastly, applications use gestalt laws.

448
00:22:56,727 --> 00:22:58,728
It's like very low hanging fruit you can do here.

449
00:22:59,148 --> 00:23:00,348
And use form follows function.

450
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:03,390
I don't rely on what people say.

451
00:23:06,372 --> 00:23:08,707
Alright, now we're going to tackle the merry part.

452
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:14,593
So memory works, again, very briefly.

453
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:17,954
It all starts with the senses, again.

454
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,835
So you have sensory memory.

455
00:23:20,656 --> 00:23:24,938
This is where everything is like it's already pre-analyzed.

456
00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:28,800
So it's part of perception and importance of attention

457
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,242
here if you really want to process the information.

458
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:33,303
So once you draw attention to something,

459
00:23:33,983 --> 00:23:36,805
again, I'm simplifying here, it goes into working memory.

460
00:23:38,046 --> 00:23:39,586
It's a short term, very short term.

461
00:23:39,606 --> 00:23:42,828
When I say short term, it's like talking about a few seconds

462
00:23:42,868 --> 00:23:45,669
or minutes, not days.

463
00:23:45,709 --> 00:23:47,390
Very short term, easily disturbed,

464
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,972
and it requires, again, very heavy attentional resources.

465
00:23:52,892 --> 00:23:54,773
And lastly, it goes to long term memory.

466
00:23:55,053 --> 00:23:57,874
Potentially, it's unlimited in time and space.

467
00:23:58,354 --> 00:23:59,015
Potentially only.

468
00:23:59,995 --> 00:24:03,496
So this is the encoding part, and we have the storage part.

469
00:24:04,137 --> 00:24:05,938
So here we're going to talk about the storage part.

470
00:24:06,896 --> 00:24:08,276
and talk about how we forget things.

471
00:24:09,997 --> 00:24:11,818
This is what we call the forgetting curve.

472
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:15,319
It was made by Embingos, a psychologist.

473
00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:20,521
He asked people to remember by heart some pseudowords,

474
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:25,763
and the variable here is the when he asked them to recall.

475
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:30,467
all these words. So he asked them, he trained them to remember all these words, and then

476
00:24:30,627 --> 00:24:32,969
the variation is when he asked them to recall the words.

477
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:40,035
Immediate recall, 100%, good answers, so no problem there. After only 19 minutes, it drops

478
00:24:40,075 --> 00:24:45,539
down to 60% of good answers. After only one day, you lose about 70% of the content learned.

479
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,223
So the forgetting curve is about long-term memory,

480
00:24:50,503 --> 00:24:53,485
are things that don't have much meaning or emotions

481
00:24:53,626 --> 00:24:54,466
fade in our brains.

482
00:24:55,307 --> 00:24:57,789
Because this was not super meaningful to the people

483
00:24:57,809 --> 00:24:58,249
to remember.

484
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,392
And this is all about the neuronal Darwinism law,

485
00:25:02,492 --> 00:25:03,713
survival of the fittest.

486
00:25:05,174 --> 00:25:06,395
Here, we're talking about synapses.

487
00:25:07,116 --> 00:25:09,418
Players are likely to forget a lot of stuff in your game,

488
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:13,721
especially since there's a known gap between the two game

489
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:14,121
sessions.

490
00:25:14,662 --> 00:25:15,803
We'll take a look at that in a minute.

491
00:25:16,591 --> 00:25:20,415
But before you do, do you remember the iOS icons I showed you earlier?

492
00:25:22,236 --> 00:25:23,117
Try to remember them.

493
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:27,521
So hopefully you did remember all of them.

494
00:25:28,122 --> 00:25:31,985
You are likely already familiar with these icons, and I made you process this information.

495
00:25:32,926 --> 00:25:36,289
However, I did not show you the telephone icon, but the camera one.

496
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:39,532
I only talked about the phone one. Did you catch that?

497
00:25:40,173 --> 00:25:42,935
Because the brain is also good at making up false memories.

498
00:25:44,305 --> 00:25:47,549
And can you tell for sure which icon is the iTunes store one

499
00:25:47,609 --> 00:25:48,690
and which one is the music one?

500
00:25:49,711 --> 00:25:50,272
Maybe you can.

501
00:25:50,492 --> 00:25:51,573
Then you rock.

502
00:25:52,935 --> 00:25:53,175
All right.

503
00:25:54,076 --> 00:25:55,959
So let's go back to the forgetting curve

504
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:56,880
and apply it to games.

505
00:25:59,363 --> 00:26:01,625
So let's say, again, very simplifying here.

506
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:04,717
You start playing game the first time.

507
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:07,820
This is your first game session, so ideally, your mastery

508
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,302
grows with the game difficulty level.

509
00:26:10,943 --> 00:26:12,264
And then you stop playing because, you know,

510
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:13,485
you need to go to sleep at some point.

511
00:26:14,326 --> 00:26:16,288
And what's happening is that maybe if you play it

512
00:26:16,348 --> 00:26:20,292
on a Sunday, you have to go to work, it might be like X days

513
00:26:20,332 --> 00:26:20,592
lag.

514
00:26:20,652 --> 00:26:22,914
We don't know how much lag between two game sessions.

515
00:26:23,294 --> 00:26:25,697
During that time, the game stays at the same level.

516
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:26,938
That's a computer.

517
00:26:27,422 --> 00:26:30,624
But us, we are under the love-forgetting curve.

518
00:26:31,265 --> 00:26:33,486
So when we resume the game, there

519
00:26:33,506 --> 00:26:36,549
can be a large discrepancy, and the player can feel downgraded.

520
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,411
So because players want to remember everything,

521
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:40,772
there are some trade-offs.

522
00:26:41,273 --> 00:26:43,134
As a designer, it's your role to define

523
00:26:43,174 --> 00:26:44,255
what we need to focus on.

524
00:26:45,096 --> 00:26:46,196
For example, in Assassin's Creed,

525
00:26:46,216 --> 00:26:47,978
the designers decided that they did not

526
00:26:48,018 --> 00:26:49,659
want the players to remember the controls,

527
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,981
so they are always shown on the head.

528
00:26:53,244 --> 00:27:00,790
So if you look at the top right, you'll see that the mapping of the controls match the PSX box controller and it's always displayed on screen and contextual.

529
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,891
Therefore, there's no need to remember this.

530
00:27:03,932 --> 00:27:08,936
Here's an example from Fortnite, where the search key is always displayed when in reach of a searchable object.

531
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,061
But beyond this obvious visual help, prioritizing the learning is crucial for a game.

532
00:27:15,581 --> 00:27:18,183
So you can decide what you truly want the player to remember.

533
00:27:18,564 --> 00:27:20,265
This is how we started doing it on Fortnite.

534
00:27:21,115 --> 00:27:23,736
Again, very early in development, pre-alpha,

535
00:27:24,317 --> 00:27:26,518
those screenshots, footage from UX testing.

536
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:32,281
So Fortnite is an action building game with RPG elements.

537
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:34,663
You are the commander of your home base.

538
00:27:35,543 --> 00:27:38,385
And by growing your home base, you unlock buffs and hero

539
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:40,746
classes, and you send your heroes out on missions.

540
00:27:41,446 --> 00:27:43,368
During the missions, you scavenge for resources,

541
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,269
craft items, build defenses, then combat zombies.

542
00:27:48,894 --> 00:27:50,496
So to put together the onboarding plan,

543
00:27:50,516 --> 00:27:52,739
I asked the designers to list all the things

544
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:54,120
the player has to learn in the game

545
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,543
and to prioritize what are the most important things

546
00:27:56,603 --> 00:27:57,144
for Fortnite.

547
00:27:58,305 --> 00:28:00,147
You'll end up with a massive list, of course.

548
00:28:00,307 --> 00:28:02,530
Here I'm just gonna show you some of the most important

549
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,331
features for Fortnite.

550
00:28:03,831 --> 00:28:05,033
You do not need to read that.

551
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:10,335
But once you have the list, you ask the designers to prioritize it regarding the game's pillar.

552
00:28:10,735 --> 00:28:15,576
Then define the order in which these tutorials have to be taught and the level of depth needed

553
00:28:15,636 --> 00:28:16,196
to teach them.

554
00:28:16,876 --> 00:28:20,977
For example, teach core movement in combat is very important, of course, but it's something

555
00:28:21,018 --> 00:28:22,998
that is usually picked up naturally by gamers.

556
00:28:23,498 --> 00:28:27,199
So it's going to be taught early, but only through dynamic tutorial text that you won't

557
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:29,600
see if you already started to move.

558
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,401
There's no need for deeper teaching for that element.

559
00:28:34,101 --> 00:28:36,262
Building is something really important in the game.

560
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:39,022
It's one of the pillars, but it's harder to pick up.

561
00:28:39,442 --> 00:28:41,003
So once you establish these elements,

562
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:44,084
you know, if it's easy, medium, hard,

563
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:48,145
and when we should have this tutorial order,

564
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:51,486
depending on the weight, you can rearrange the list.

565
00:28:54,807 --> 00:28:57,067
Okay, so let's look at home base one here.

566
00:28:57,107 --> 00:28:58,208
So it's the first one.

567
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:02,860
Once the list is in order, you have to decide what's the onboarding plan.

568
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,701
For each feature, you need to adapt the player's perspective and understand why learning this

569
00:29:06,761 --> 00:29:07,982
element is important to them.

570
00:29:08,602 --> 00:29:10,462
So home base is going to be player's persona.

571
00:29:10,962 --> 00:29:16,644
It's medium difficulty because in some, many RPG games, your persona is actually the hero

572
00:29:16,664 --> 00:29:18,064
you control, but it's not the case here.

573
00:29:18,404 --> 00:29:21,005
So it could have some difficulty learning that.

574
00:29:22,205 --> 00:29:26,706
And for the player, what he needs is that this is me in the game, so put I in that bucket,

575
00:29:27,646 --> 00:29:29,487
put you in the shoes of the player.

576
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,878
I start by naming and choosing the banner for my home base.

577
00:29:33,992 --> 00:29:35,872
And you do that for every feature of the game.

578
00:29:36,472 --> 00:29:39,413
This methodology will allow you to make faster decisions

579
00:29:39,813 --> 00:29:42,073
and build hypotheses about the game and its experience

580
00:29:42,093 --> 00:29:44,794
that you will be able to test with play tests and analytics

581
00:29:44,854 --> 00:29:45,214
later on.

582
00:29:45,874 --> 00:29:47,915
The last thing you do is building a narrative

583
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:49,835
that will bring all the pieces together.

584
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,016
If you start with a narrative, which

585
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:53,796
is tempting because we all love stories,

586
00:29:54,276 --> 00:29:55,777
you actually take the risk of needing

587
00:29:55,797 --> 00:29:58,377
to adjust your onboarding to the narrative, which could

588
00:29:58,417 --> 00:29:59,517
hurt the experience of the game.

589
00:30:00,138 --> 00:30:01,858
Narratives should be at the service of gameplay

590
00:30:01,878 --> 00:30:03,678
and transcend the onboarding plan.

591
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:05,219
So you do that less.

592
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:10,780
So here's an example of how this process helped us to make a faster decision regarding the

593
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,261
feature order in our early onboarding process.

594
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:17,662
So we had a choice to make at the very beginning of the game.

595
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,542
Should we start with boots on the ground?

596
00:30:19,562 --> 00:30:23,943
Like, have the player, like, incarnate a hero and start breaking stuff.

597
00:30:24,603 --> 00:30:26,944
The pros of that is exciting action while away.

598
00:30:27,624 --> 00:30:31,985
The cons is that player can actually wrongly believe the first hero is the persistent element

599
00:30:32,065 --> 00:30:33,125
where actually it's home base.

600
00:30:34,932 --> 00:30:36,134
Or we could start with home base.

601
00:30:36,754 --> 00:30:39,617
The pros of that is that we set the expectation correctly

602
00:30:39,998 --> 00:30:41,760
and it gives medium term motivation

603
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,981
because starting with home base,

604
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:45,523
set a mission to get something for your home base

605
00:30:45,984 --> 00:30:49,027
so you know that you're gonna have that short term reward.

606
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,969
The cons of that is longer to start the action.

607
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,930
But home base is a player's persona in the game,

608
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,571
what they grow, what is persistent.

609
00:30:56,891 --> 00:30:58,512
So it's a very important feature for us.

610
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:00,593
So that's why we decided, so far,

611
00:31:01,254 --> 00:31:03,815
to go with home base first, as fast as possible,

612
00:31:03,955 --> 00:31:06,356
so at least expectations are set correctly for the player.

613
00:31:07,017 --> 00:31:08,577
We know we're making trade-offs here,

614
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:10,418
but it's really important for the experience

615
00:31:10,939 --> 00:31:12,479
that players identify themselves

616
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:13,940
to their home base as soon as possible.

617
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,421
We decided to go through Homebase very quickly,

618
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:19,261
three minutes top, and basically show the players a base

619
00:31:19,321 --> 00:31:21,202
they can expand now that it's theirs.

620
00:31:21,822 --> 00:31:23,862
So they just have to name it, choose a banner,

621
00:31:24,342 --> 00:31:26,443
and then start a mission to gain rewards

622
00:31:26,483 --> 00:31:27,643
to start growing their base.

623
00:31:28,363 --> 00:31:30,304
So prioritize the learning you have to define.

624
00:31:31,124 --> 00:31:33,104
Prioritize the learning means you have to define

625
00:31:33,144 --> 00:31:35,245
what trade-offs are the least damageable

626
00:31:35,585 --> 00:31:36,705
to the experience you want to offer,

627
00:31:37,165 --> 00:31:38,525
because there are no perfect solutions.

628
00:31:40,885 --> 00:31:42,847
And then to verify the player's got new intentions,

629
00:31:43,227 --> 00:31:44,929
we ask questions about the perceptions

630
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,690
about after the gameplay.

631
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:50,013
But in a way, you can validate or invalidate an hypothesis.

632
00:31:50,554 --> 00:31:52,335
Since our goal is to make home base meaningful,

633
00:31:52,355 --> 00:31:53,716
some questions are meant to find out

634
00:31:53,736 --> 00:31:55,558
that this is how are the perceived home base.

635
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:58,881
Of course, the order of these questions is randomly generated.

636
00:31:58,901 --> 00:32:01,763
And we also ask questions right after the mission

637
00:32:02,764 --> 00:32:04,745
to check if they understood the concept of home base

638
00:32:05,126 --> 00:32:05,646
at its core.

639
00:32:05,826 --> 00:32:07,888
We don't expect them to understand all the details

640
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:08,368
at that point.

641
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:10,910
But you check to see if they understood

642
00:32:11,151 --> 00:32:12,111
what we tried to convey.

643
00:32:13,653 --> 00:32:16,915
And afterwards, when you can actually have analytics,

644
00:32:17,196 --> 00:32:19,217
you can verify if actually, like in our case,

645
00:32:19,577 --> 00:32:22,420
people are using home base and building stuff

646
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,000
in their home base.

647
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:27,597
And we went on with all the features.

648
00:32:28,297 --> 00:32:31,438
For example, do we need to teach about scavenging?

649
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:36,019
Actually, in our playtest so far, including 13 years old,

650
00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:39,100
players immediately started destroying stuff with the stick.

651
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:42,181
So it was not essential to have a proper tutorial for that.

652
00:32:42,781 --> 00:32:44,322
On the other hand, many players in tests

653
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:47,663
were not seen crafting guns or making doors soon enough.

654
00:32:47,983 --> 00:32:50,324
It's a problem because they were just building walls,

655
00:32:50,664 --> 00:32:52,585
and then they were stuck in their box,

656
00:32:52,665 --> 00:32:53,845
and they were destroying one wall.

657
00:32:54,545 --> 00:32:57,866
So actually, it's important to know how to craft a door.

658
00:32:58,547 --> 00:33:02,928
So we did tutorials for this mechanic since the game loses its fun when you don't know how to do that.

659
00:33:03,968 --> 00:33:07,249
I'm going to show you some examples from a crafting building later in the presentation.

660
00:33:08,409 --> 00:33:12,170
So here it is for memory. In a nutshell, it's encoding in storage,

661
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:19,851
limitations for getting curve. That's the reason why the GDC peeps is always reminding you that you need to answer the survey

662
00:33:20,731 --> 00:33:24,072
to give you, to give feedback, because we don't remember this stuff.

663
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:28,392
An application, reduce memory load and prioritize learning.

664
00:33:28,412 --> 00:33:34,076
All right, I'm hoping you still have your attention here, because this is what we're

665
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:39,899
going to talk, attentional resources, and again, I'm not going to talk about other

666
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,540
factors here, just the attention.

667
00:33:42,701 --> 00:33:45,022
But before we do that, let's take a brain break a little bit.

668
00:33:46,002 --> 00:33:49,845
I'm going to ask you to pick one card, choose one card, and remember that card.

669
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:51,125
Pick one.

670
00:33:51,145 --> 00:33:53,207
All right.

671
00:33:54,744 --> 00:33:57,787
I bet I can guess which card you picked and make it disappear.

672
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:00,429
Did it disappear?

673
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,532
Yes, but actually I changed all the cards.

674
00:34:06,871 --> 00:34:08,652
Yeah, sorry, it's very lousy.

675
00:34:10,193 --> 00:34:12,955
But magicians know very well how to trick your attention.

676
00:34:12,975 --> 00:34:14,537
This is how they do their magic tricks.

677
00:34:15,537 --> 00:34:17,339
This is called change blindness.

678
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,121
It's the failure to notice an object's change.

679
00:34:20,461 --> 00:34:23,203
There's another pendant of that is unintentional blindness,

680
00:34:23,503 --> 00:34:25,985
the failure to notice the existence of an unexpected

681
00:34:26,085 --> 00:34:26,345
item.

682
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:28,827
So this is the example when you have to count the basketball

683
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:32,309
passes and you don't see the gorilla while you do that.

684
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:36,891
So you have to find a way to ensure you have the player's attention if you're conveying important information.

685
00:34:38,631 --> 00:34:41,912
By the way, did you notice that I put a gorilla on this image earlier?

686
00:34:44,312 --> 00:34:44,652
Sorry.

687
00:34:47,873 --> 00:34:51,314
So we are not carefully scanning all of our environment.

688
00:34:51,654 --> 00:34:56,175
So this is not what we're doing. This is the reason why finding Waldo is freaking difficult.

689
00:34:56,715 --> 00:34:59,776
Instead, our attention works like a spotlight.

690
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:03,229
Speaking of which, these spot flasks are killing me.

691
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,670
So we need to make sure that the player is not overwhelmed

692
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,250
by multiple inputs and draw his or her attention

693
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,771
to the important information you want to convey.

694
00:35:14,231 --> 00:35:17,672
Multitasking is a myth, and it's actually not that simple

695
00:35:17,712 --> 00:35:19,512
to draw the player's attention to something.

696
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:22,813
However, when you learn, attention is a key component

697
00:35:22,893 --> 00:35:24,053
to successful encoding.

698
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:26,073
So you have to find a way to ensure

699
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:27,093
you have the player's attention

700
00:35:27,453 --> 00:35:29,074
if you're conveying important information.

701
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:30,614
It's not easy.

702
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:34,148
So even though a lot of people now understand

703
00:35:34,168 --> 00:35:35,969
that multitasking is a myth, there are still

704
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:38,009
a lot of games that fire multiple inputs

705
00:35:38,029 --> 00:35:38,670
at the same time.

706
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:41,991
Like in games where an NPC is talking to you

707
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:44,632
while you learn how to drive a car, for example.

708
00:35:45,332 --> 00:35:47,353
Here's an example in Fortnite, on boarding.

709
00:35:49,108 --> 00:35:53,953
So there's a tutorial text about how 3Gen that pops up at the moment you get the first

710
00:35:54,273 --> 00:35:55,034
enemy encounter.

711
00:35:55,514 --> 00:35:57,036
Sorry, it's low res again.

712
00:35:57,056 --> 00:36:00,779
You have that gameplay tip, but at that moment the player is really not paying attention

713
00:36:00,799 --> 00:36:03,621
to that because he's got to freaking kill the enemies.

714
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:07,145
So we cannot really see that at that moment.

715
00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:15,704
So, it's not when the brain has enough attentional resources to look.

716
00:36:16,024 --> 00:36:22,169
It's when you want to show something, trying to get my train of thought, you want to make

717
00:36:22,229 --> 00:36:27,734
sure that the brain is going to be able to draw attention, to pay attention to that very

718
00:36:27,754 --> 00:36:27,934
thing.

719
00:36:28,274 --> 00:36:31,977
So, it's difficult because in the game there's multiple things you need to pay attention

720
00:36:32,018 --> 00:36:35,220
to and this is where it's actually hard to make.

721
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,930
So true, the good thing in that example

722
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,391
is that we're trying to cheat at a meaningful moment

723
00:36:40,852 --> 00:36:43,633
about regen health, but it's actually not a good call

724
00:36:43,673 --> 00:36:45,894
to try to draw player's attention when under threat.

725
00:36:46,754 --> 00:36:48,315
Right after, still meaningful,

726
00:36:48,335 --> 00:36:50,196
and the player can actually pay attention and do it,

727
00:36:50,516 --> 00:36:51,176
is the way to go.

728
00:36:55,518 --> 00:36:56,158
No multitask.

729
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:02,698
So another example of minimum workload and drawing attention

730
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:06,560
is what I call the red overload problem.

731
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,941
So red is a great color to draw attention, especially

732
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:13,443
in the West, to draw attention to dangerous, critical things,

733
00:37:13,863 --> 00:37:15,663
getting hurt, critical health, et cetera.

734
00:37:16,364 --> 00:37:18,445
The problem is that red is often overused.

735
00:37:18,965 --> 00:37:21,986
And when that happens, it loses attention-drawing advantages.

736
00:37:22,346 --> 00:37:24,407
If too many things are red, then a red element

737
00:37:24,427 --> 00:37:25,288
stops to stand out.

738
00:37:26,522 --> 00:37:29,265
So as we are developing the new Unreal tournament,

739
00:37:29,606 --> 00:37:33,670
we did a UX test on UT3 to check the problems the game had.

740
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,672
And so we don't do the same mistakes.

741
00:37:36,533 --> 00:37:38,395
Turns out that there's a huge red overload

742
00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:39,696
when you're on the red team.

743
00:37:40,277 --> 00:37:41,078
Your head is red.

744
00:37:41,138 --> 00:37:41,798
Everything is red.

745
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,023
So it's harder than to spot the red feedback telling you

746
00:37:46,043 --> 00:37:47,585
you're getting hurt and you need to react.

747
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:51,342
So here, because everything's red, it's actually,

748
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,187
it takes more time to see, to perceive that thing,

749
00:37:55,188 --> 00:37:56,751
which is actually the important information here.

750
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,181
So many PvP games have blue versus red teams,

751
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:01,922
and gamers usually like this convention.

752
00:38:02,623 --> 00:38:04,864
However, most of them don't realize the red team

753
00:38:04,944 --> 00:38:07,486
is disadvantaged versus the blue team.

754
00:38:08,046 --> 00:38:09,527
Actually, analytics on Gears of War 3

755
00:38:09,847 --> 00:38:11,308
showed that the blue team overall

756
00:38:11,328 --> 00:38:14,530
had a 5% better win rate than the red team.

757
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,752
Since we sold Gears, I don't have the data anymore,

758
00:38:17,852 --> 00:38:20,713
so we're actually looking at the data on Unreal,

759
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:23,695
and we'll see if it's confirming this thing.

760
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:30,170
The best scenario to me would be to always be on the blue team and the enemy team to be orange, not red.

761
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,171
So red can be saved for the critical events.

762
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:36,913
So in Fortnite, we used to have enemy bars in red,

763
00:38:37,834 --> 00:38:42,676
and the red damage feedback was too far away from the right equal.

764
00:38:43,951 --> 00:38:46,833
So we removed nearly all red signs and feedback

765
00:38:46,913 --> 00:38:48,754
except for critical information for the player,

766
00:38:49,334 --> 00:38:50,575
getting hurt and from where,

767
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:53,116
and we put the red feedback on getting hurt

768
00:38:53,216 --> 00:38:55,757
closer to the reticle, where attention usually is.

769
00:38:56,718 --> 00:38:58,079
So the enemy bar is now orange,

770
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:02,061
and we saw unnoticed death rate getting much lower.

771
00:39:03,256 --> 00:39:05,218
Again, this is just about adding clarity in the UI

772
00:39:05,238 --> 00:39:06,539
to reduce the attention workload.

773
00:39:06,959 --> 00:39:08,000
Think about the green golf ball.

774
00:39:09,201 --> 00:39:11,583
Prioritize what is important for the experience

775
00:39:11,663 --> 00:39:13,925
and remove all potential friction points.

776
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:16,668
And think about your worst case scenario.

777
00:39:17,128 --> 00:39:18,790
Sure, it might not feel like Red Overload

778
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:21,252
when one or two enemies, but it could later in game

779
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,513
when it's getting super challenging.

780
00:39:27,543 --> 00:39:31,244
So, one important thing here to remember, if there's one thing you have to remember,

781
00:39:31,424 --> 00:39:31,945
that would be it.

782
00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:36,946
People learn and remember way better what is meaningful to them and emotional.

783
00:39:37,246 --> 00:39:38,607
That helps to draw attention.

784
00:39:39,447 --> 00:39:45,829
So, the thing is, the deeper you process information, so the more you focus your attention on something,

785
00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:47,830
the better you're going to learn or retain.

786
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,993
What it means is that you have to give context of learning.

787
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:56,556
Make sure that the player is always learning while doing it.

788
00:39:57,537 --> 00:39:58,638
And you have to give meaning.

789
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:02,742
It has to be worthwhile now for the player, for his mission, for his life.

790
00:40:04,123 --> 00:40:05,545
And this is different from the narrative.

791
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:09,965
So, I'm going to give three examples of what I mean here.

792
00:40:11,966 --> 00:40:15,106
So, one of these examples is Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon.

793
00:40:15,566 --> 00:40:18,387
It's an example where you have no context and no meaning.

794
00:40:18,907 --> 00:40:20,748
It's made on purpose, so it's hilarious.

795
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:21,728
So, it's okay.

796
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:26,729
But, it's an example when you cannot actually do the things that you're taught,

797
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:28,509
and there's no deep meaning.

798
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,950
Loading more training hints from the ABCs of War.

799
00:41:24,594 --> 00:41:26,355
I fucking hate tutorials.

800
00:41:26,775 --> 00:41:29,097
And this one is terrible.

801
00:41:29,917 --> 00:41:32,519
I love that game.

802
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,662
So anyway, here's another example.

803
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:38,423
So Call of Duty 2.

804
00:41:38,844 --> 00:41:41,145
Again, I'm using these gumpuls because I've

805
00:41:41,185 --> 00:41:42,346
played this game, obviously.

806
00:41:42,466 --> 00:41:45,528
And it's just because it's illustrating one point.

807
00:41:45,708 --> 00:41:48,290
I'm actually not pointing fingers here.

808
00:41:49,331 --> 00:41:51,032
Call of Duty 2, here you have context

809
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:52,273
because you learn by doing.

810
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,794
But the meaning is weak.

811
00:41:54,834 --> 00:42:01,138
Very good, comrade. Always remember to use the star on your compass to reach your current objective.

812
00:42:01,918 --> 00:42:07,462
Okay, Vasily. Let us see how good your aim is. Aim for one of those two teddy bears.

813
00:42:10,925 --> 00:42:11,745
Good, now fire.

814
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:15,007
Good, now fire at the other one.

815
00:42:16,268 --> 00:42:20,951
Good for short-range, comrade. But for long-range targets, a rifle is better.

816
00:42:22,691 --> 00:42:25,353
OK, so here, when you talk, you can actually

817
00:42:25,533 --> 00:42:27,635
practice it right away so you have context.

818
00:42:28,335 --> 00:42:31,518
The meaning is a bit weak because the teddy bears are not

819
00:42:31,598 --> 00:42:32,318
super threatening.

820
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:35,481
And also, you cannot really experience why.

821
00:42:35,701 --> 00:42:37,302
Why really is it meaningful?

822
00:42:37,723 --> 00:42:39,384
You cannot experience it right away.

823
00:42:41,194 --> 00:42:42,955
One last example is from Uncharted 2,

824
00:42:43,175 --> 00:42:44,436
where you have context and meaning.

825
00:42:44,616 --> 00:42:45,777
So what I'm going to show you is right

826
00:42:45,837 --> 00:42:49,199
after the introduction cut scene.

827
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,881
And you start, what you see here is when you actually

828
00:42:51,921 --> 00:42:52,822
start to have control.

829
00:43:13,604 --> 00:43:16,705
So the player starts moving, there's no tutorial text about moving.

830
00:43:36,051 --> 00:43:37,692
So you taught to jump at the moment,

831
00:43:37,932 --> 00:43:39,353
and it's really meaningful to you.

832
00:43:40,934 --> 00:43:45,197
So of course, this is scripted, so it's more easy to do.

833
00:43:45,678 --> 00:43:48,660
But we can actually apply that for all games.

834
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,201
So you want to avoid the learn then do,

835
00:43:51,902 --> 00:43:55,044
because having a lot of text, you won't remember it.

836
00:43:55,484 --> 00:43:58,146
Even if you're a hardcore gamer, you're not going to remember it.

837
00:44:00,047 --> 00:44:02,649
And what you try to do is have learning by doing.

838
00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:08,532
And you have deeper process when you're in content, and you have greater motivation if

839
00:44:08,552 --> 00:44:09,032
there's meaning.

840
00:44:09,853 --> 00:44:12,915
So that just improves the way we can remember stuff.

841
00:44:15,342 --> 00:44:17,324
So of course, early on, you use whatever

842
00:44:17,384 --> 00:44:19,606
is already in your game to start building the onboarding.

843
00:44:19,926 --> 00:44:21,347
And that's why, even though you know it's not

844
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,068
going to work great, you do whatever

845
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:24,950
you can at that development stage you are.

846
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:27,452
So if you have your hypothesis ready,

847
00:44:27,552 --> 00:44:29,113
you will actually gain much more insight

848
00:44:29,374 --> 00:44:30,534
from the early playtests.

849
00:44:30,995 --> 00:44:33,316
which will allow you to improve the game faster and better.

850
00:44:33,896 --> 00:44:36,638
So this is the example of building in Fortnite.

851
00:44:37,298 --> 00:44:41,220
So back in the day, what we did for Fortnite,

852
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,082
we knew we had to teach building because it was more complex.

853
00:44:44,722 --> 00:44:47,924
And so we had that sort of tutorial mission

854
00:44:48,404 --> 00:44:51,045
where you had to protect a tractor and build around it.

855
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:57,174
So notice that they have a countdown, like it's 1 minute 40.

856
00:44:57,894 --> 00:45:00,376
And the thing is, because in Fortnite everything is destructible,

857
00:45:00,596 --> 00:45:02,397
the first thing they try to do is destroy the tractor.

858
00:45:02,978 --> 00:45:04,819
And here we actually tell them to protect it.

859
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:06,260
So it's counterintuitive.

860
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:10,483
So the player is like, okay, I can't really destroy that,

861
00:45:10,503 --> 00:45:12,224
so what do I need to do? Protect it.

862
00:45:12,664 --> 00:45:17,367
So they actually have to, you know, build defenses around the barn

863
00:45:17,508 --> 00:45:20,109
or close the barn to protect it from the enemies.

864
00:45:20,983 --> 00:45:26,708
So because the opening of the barn is not really matching the wall, the player is a

865
00:45:26,748 --> 00:45:29,151
bit confused, I'm editing stuff.

866
00:45:29,871 --> 00:45:31,373
We're not going to go through the whole minute.

867
00:45:32,634 --> 00:45:36,718
So here it is, it's trying to figure out what can I do, and we saw that over and over again.

868
00:45:37,418 --> 00:45:42,123
So okay, places one wall here, and oh god, I don't have enough resources to build another

869
00:45:42,143 --> 00:45:42,363
wall.

870
00:45:42,943 --> 00:45:46,467
And there's only 25 seconds left before the husks arrive.

871
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,351
So this is an example where the player is told

872
00:45:50,391 --> 00:45:51,312
to protect a tractor.

873
00:45:51,452 --> 00:45:54,093
This is misleading, because everywhere else in the game,

874
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,753
you have to destroy everything.

875
00:45:56,193 --> 00:45:57,674
So you don't want foreign boarding

876
00:45:57,834 --> 00:45:59,394
to change the rules of the game.

877
00:46:00,395 --> 00:46:02,295
Also, building a protection around the barn

878
00:46:03,256 --> 00:46:06,236
is unintuitive, and the player is in a stressful situation

879
00:46:06,256 --> 00:46:08,357
because there's a timer, and he's set for failure.

880
00:46:08,597 --> 00:46:11,038
It's never fun to fail at the very beginning of the game.

881
00:46:12,459 --> 00:46:14,679
So you have context, but you have poor

882
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:15,940
and misleading meaning here.

883
00:46:17,345 --> 00:46:18,046
So we changed it.

884
00:46:18,586 --> 00:46:22,209
And now what's happening is we place the player in a pit,

885
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,531
and he has to build his or her way out.

886
00:46:25,332 --> 00:46:27,173
So there's a lot of resources in the pit.

887
00:46:27,193 --> 00:46:28,995
The player can choose to destroy all the things

888
00:46:29,455 --> 00:46:31,797
or just build his way out immediately.

889
00:46:34,399 --> 00:46:37,282
There's no time pressure, but you want to get out of here

890
00:46:37,322 --> 00:46:39,183
because Fortnite is all about exploration.

891
00:46:40,224 --> 00:46:42,266
So you're like, okay, I'm done with here.

892
00:46:42,286 --> 00:46:44,087
I'm going out.

893
00:46:44,107 --> 00:46:44,688
Way to build.

894
00:46:45,168 --> 00:46:46,089
You got out of that pit.

895
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:53,051
So in that case, the player is told to build his or her way out.

896
00:46:54,092 --> 00:46:57,835
The player has all the time needed, yet is motivated to get out of it.

897
00:46:58,196 --> 00:47:00,718
And we set the players for success here.

898
00:47:01,058 --> 00:47:02,340
So here you have greater meaning.

899
00:47:05,088 --> 00:47:07,889
Now, another example of a crafting tutorial.

900
00:47:08,589 --> 00:47:09,450
Again, I apologize.

901
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:13,212
This screenshot is from November 2014.

902
00:47:13,252 --> 00:47:16,313
Playtest, the low res.

903
00:47:16,773 --> 00:47:17,894
I still wanted to show you that.

904
00:47:18,914 --> 00:47:21,776
So at the very beginning of the game, we teach about crafting.

905
00:47:22,356 --> 00:47:25,557
And at that time, we're just telling the player, OK,

906
00:47:25,597 --> 00:47:27,738
you have to gather resources to craft a pickaxe.

907
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:31,900
And after we say that, we just tell them to destroy rocks

908
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,441
to collect ore.

909
00:47:33,681 --> 00:47:38,082
And so we had that very step-by-step things players were asked to do,

910
00:47:39,042 --> 00:47:41,823
with a clear understanding of the end purpose, like craft a pickaxe.

911
00:47:42,203 --> 00:47:47,724
So it's in context with poor meaning, and they had to do things in certain order,

912
00:47:48,145 --> 00:47:54,806
and they were not really... they didn't know how much rocks they need to collect, or how much wood.

913
00:47:55,786 --> 00:47:56,607
So we changed that again.

914
00:47:58,248 --> 00:48:00,350
And what we did here, this is a better screenshot,

915
00:48:01,471 --> 00:48:04,593
is we just give clearly the purpose for the tutorial.

916
00:48:04,613 --> 00:48:05,914
You have to craft a pickaxe.

917
00:48:06,154 --> 00:48:08,016
And to craft a pickaxe, you need to collect ore,

918
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,798
and you need to collect planks, so wood.

919
00:48:11,278 --> 00:48:13,740
And you know how many of each you need to collect.

920
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,182
And the player does it in whatever order he or she wants.

921
00:48:17,843 --> 00:48:19,864
So this offers more freedom.

922
00:48:20,224 --> 00:48:22,226
It's clearly told, the player is clearly told

923
00:48:22,306 --> 00:48:25,668
the purpose for that thing, so it's greater meaning.

924
00:48:28,225 --> 00:48:28,705
So that's it.

925
00:48:29,466 --> 00:48:31,547
That was the last bucket of attention.

926
00:48:31,648 --> 00:48:33,689
So how it works in the nutshell, it's a spotlight.

927
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:37,412
Limitations, you have an attentional blindness,

928
00:48:37,492 --> 00:48:38,473
low attention span.

929
00:48:38,954 --> 00:48:42,076
I'm hoping that not too many people are sleeping in here.

930
00:48:43,417 --> 00:48:46,680
And application examples, it's minimum workload

931
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,561
and give context and meanings.

932
00:48:49,082 --> 00:48:51,884
And again, this is just a few examples and a few limitations.

933
00:48:52,565 --> 00:48:54,066
It's, again, more complex than that.

934
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:00,321
So, all these brain limitations are actually at the core of user experience heuristics,

935
00:49:00,681 --> 00:49:05,222
and this is why it can help you, because it's all based on brain limitations.

936
00:49:07,502 --> 00:49:12,684
So the brain is extremely good at making a quickly, at quickly making sense of the world

937
00:49:12,724 --> 00:49:13,864
with little information.

938
00:49:14,324 --> 00:49:16,004
That's how we survived our predators.

939
00:49:16,665 --> 00:49:19,245
So all the mistakes the brain makes are insecure.

940
00:49:20,962 --> 00:49:23,804
are insignificant trade-offs in the scale of evolution.

941
00:49:24,605 --> 00:49:26,366
However, it can help you gain precious time

942
00:49:26,566 --> 00:49:28,527
and avoid great caveats if you are aware

943
00:49:28,567 --> 00:49:31,209
of the brain limitations and can remember all of them.

944
00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:32,830
You won't remember all of them.

945
00:49:34,131 --> 00:49:38,454
So, to conclude, remember that the gamer's brain

946
00:49:38,514 --> 00:49:41,656
is heavily biased, and so is yours.

947
00:49:42,997 --> 00:49:44,217
The problem with the brain is that

948
00:49:44,558 --> 00:49:45,718
not only is it heavily biased,

949
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:47,980
but we strongly believe it's not the case.

950
00:49:48,846 --> 00:49:51,627
We believe our senses are accurately convey reality

951
00:49:51,967 --> 00:49:55,668
when in fact what we perceive is a construction of our brains.

952
00:49:56,349 --> 00:49:59,150
We believe that we have a good memory when research shows

953
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:01,631
that we can easily forget, and even that we are

954
00:50:01,671 --> 00:50:03,091
very prone to false memories.

955
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,292
We believe we can efficiently multitask

956
00:50:06,672 --> 00:50:09,133
when research shows that we actually suck at it.

957
00:50:10,214 --> 00:50:12,214
Most gamers will set the hud in your game as clear,

958
00:50:12,575 --> 00:50:14,675
but then they will fail to explain it accurately

959
00:50:15,035 --> 00:50:16,036
when asked to describe it.

960
00:50:17,052 --> 00:50:19,093
You might believe you have a great design intuition,

961
00:50:19,534 --> 00:50:21,695
but are you sure you can rely on it?

962
00:50:22,296 --> 00:50:24,237
And what about when different people of your team

963
00:50:24,277 --> 00:50:25,218
have different opinions?

964
00:50:25,939 --> 00:50:27,440
How you can make the right choice?

965
00:50:29,542 --> 00:50:31,383
So all the brain limitations we talk about

966
00:50:31,683 --> 00:50:32,864
are the core of UX heuristics,

967
00:50:33,285 --> 00:50:35,146
which you can use as a checklist

968
00:50:35,486 --> 00:50:37,768
to help you make faster and more enlightened decisions.

969
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:41,534
Of course, this is no precise science, as the brain is complex.

970
00:50:42,055 --> 00:50:46,340
And if there was a recipe for cooking great games, we would know about it, and I would

971
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:46,961
be out of job.

972
00:50:48,142 --> 00:50:50,065
Heavily trained pilots use checklists, too.

973
00:50:50,445 --> 00:50:52,408
It's not because they're un-good at their job.

974
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,752
It's because they know they cannot efficiently rely on their brains.

975
00:50:56,607 --> 00:50:59,371
Creating a video game is not as risky as piloting a plane,

976
00:50:59,831 --> 00:51:01,814
but it is nonetheless a very complex endeavor.

977
00:51:02,395 --> 00:51:04,138
Next time you're flying, think about this.

978
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:06,601
I hope that you learn new things about the brain

979
00:51:06,841 --> 00:51:07,923
and that this will help you.

980
00:51:08,464 --> 00:51:10,527
I'd be very interested to get your feedback on all this.

981
00:51:11,648 --> 00:51:12,790
Thanks so much for attention.

982
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:28,735
So we have about nine minutes, maybe less than that,

983
00:51:28,755 --> 00:51:31,179
because I'm guessing I need to give the place.

984
00:51:31,219 --> 00:51:34,684
So if you have questions, you can go up to these mics.

985
00:51:39,193 --> 00:51:41,134
Hello, thank you for your great talk.

986
00:51:41,154 --> 00:51:42,574
I really enjoyed it.

987
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:46,436
At one point, you mentioned asking the players

988
00:51:46,516 --> 00:51:48,077
how they felt about the game.

989
00:51:48,297 --> 00:51:49,318
Do you feel you understand it?

990
00:51:49,338 --> 00:51:50,298
Do you not feel you understand it?

991
00:51:50,778 --> 00:51:52,559
How important do you think that is compared

992
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:56,041
to testing them to find out if they actually understand it?

993
00:51:56,953 --> 00:51:59,575
Both are important, because you want to test the reality,

994
00:52:00,135 --> 00:52:02,737
you want to test how they behave and what's happening,

995
00:52:03,097 --> 00:52:04,458
but you also want to test the perception,

996
00:52:04,778 --> 00:52:06,859
because maybe on paper everything is all good,

997
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,701
but they did not perceive it in that way.

998
00:52:09,781 --> 00:52:12,003
So you want to test both, but you have to be clear

999
00:52:12,063 --> 00:52:13,944
on what you're testing with what methods.

1000
00:52:16,419 --> 00:52:17,380
Thanks, great presentation.

1001
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:22,987
You just barely touched on the role of emotion in learning.

1002
00:52:23,668 --> 00:52:25,731
And I think that there's a whole topic in there,

1003
00:52:25,771 --> 00:52:27,994
but I wonder if you could just take a little bit of time

1004
00:52:28,034 --> 00:52:29,315
just to talk a little bit more about

1005
00:52:29,676 --> 00:52:32,760
how games engage emotion and therefore improve learning.

1006
00:52:34,097 --> 00:52:39,442
Yes, I just talk a little bit about that when I say that whenever you teach something it

1007
00:52:39,502 --> 00:52:40,422
has to be meaningful.

1008
00:52:41,443 --> 00:52:46,608
If you put the player in an emotional situation, of course it's going to raise your awareness.

1009
00:52:47,529 --> 00:52:50,171
That's a very complex subject.

1010
00:52:51,152 --> 00:52:56,957
Implicit motivation is really important, you know, your drives, this is all very in your

1011
00:52:57,618 --> 00:53:00,740
very inner side part of the brain.

1012
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,362
Music is also a great way to convey a lot of emotions.

1013
00:53:04,803 --> 00:53:09,485
So it's hard in one minute to describe all these things.

1014
00:53:09,846 --> 00:53:12,447
I need a whole new topic to talk about that.

1015
00:53:12,727 --> 00:53:16,970
But just showing, have meaningful environments to

1016
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:17,731
teach players.

1017
00:53:17,991 --> 00:53:21,433
It's really how emotions can help you focus on things.

1018
00:53:24,215 --> 00:53:24,355
Hi.

1019
00:53:24,615 --> 00:53:24,935
All right.

1020
00:53:26,102 --> 00:53:27,524
Thank you so much again for your attention.

1021
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:29,847
I know it's a heavy load.

1022
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:32,050
So thanks again, and have a great GDC.
