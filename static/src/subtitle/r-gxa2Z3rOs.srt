1
00:00:06,917 --> 00:00:09,139
Hey there, welcome to this Ask Me Anything session.

2
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:11,601
We're going to talk about diverse teams today

3
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:14,103
with special guest Carl Vernado.

4
00:00:14,163 --> 00:00:16,726
He's chair of Black and Gaming, an educator,

5
00:00:17,347 --> 00:00:19,589
and a regular GDC speaker.

6
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:22,371
I think you've been giving talks for five, 10, 15 years, right?

7
00:00:23,272 --> 00:00:24,093
About five years, yeah.

8
00:00:24,453 --> 00:00:27,856
I've been a GCE attendee since the 2000s, but yeah.

9
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:28,685
Hmm.

10
00:00:29,605 --> 00:00:30,746
Yeah, that lasted me.

11
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:34,889
So we're gonna sort of have like a general discussion here for about a half hour.

12
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,710
We got a chat that's filling up right now, folks in chat.

13
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:40,572
We're gonna ask your questions to Carl.

14
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:44,274
He's had lots of experience in games and has a lot of things to say about it.

15
00:00:44,715 --> 00:00:48,737
So please just ask whatever questions come to mind, especially about, you know, diversity

16
00:00:48,797 --> 00:00:53,840
and game development, inclusion, upvote questions, if you like them, and we'll get them over.

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,681
So while we get started, Carl, can you fill folks in on sort of what you've been doing

18
00:00:55,701 --> 00:00:55,741
in.

19
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:55,881
Okay.

20
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:55,981
Cool.

21
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:56,242
Thanks a lot.

22
00:00:56,262 --> 00:00:56,482
Thanks, Carl.

23
00:00:56,502 --> 00:00:56,842
Yeah, thanks a lot.

24
00:00:56,862 --> 00:00:56,982
Thanks.

25
00:00:57,002 --> 00:00:57,182
Thank you.

26
00:00:57,816 --> 00:01:01,300
I'm going to ask you to tell us a little bit about your career in games.

27
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,222
So I had a game studio in 2003, 2007 in Chicago.

28
00:01:03,783 --> 00:01:05,726
My lesson was in the film industry for a couple of years.

29
00:01:05,746 --> 00:01:08,449
And I worked in film industry. And I went into education.

30
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:10,712
So I taught Sarkozy kids how to make games.

31
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,402
Video games, films, animation, stuff like that. And so I've been active in the game industry as an

32
00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:22,923
activist. I helped Black in Games start Black in Games in 2005 and been a part of that organization

33
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:28,905
on and off since. And then I became the chair in 2014. And so I'm all about getting African

34
00:01:28,925 --> 00:01:35,147
Americans more prominent, more education, more industry access in the game industry.

35
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:50,500
Right on. As we wait to get some questions here, I think the first thing that jumps to mind is, I want to know how you've seen the industry change in this specific regard, you know, over the last five years at least. Like, have you seen any significant changes, positively or negatively?

36
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:52,782
For diversity or for black people in gaming?

37
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,984
Seeing black people in gaming specifically represented among gamers.

38
00:01:56,185 --> 00:02:04,391
Black people have always been in gaming between 1 to 2% for the last 35 years. Like, the number has not changed significantly.

39
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:09,488
The game industry itself has expanded, so because the game industry itself has expanded,

40
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,111
there are more African Americans in the game industry, but percentage-wise, we still hover

41
00:02:13,151 --> 00:02:15,992
between the 1% to 2% dynamic.

42
00:02:16,793 --> 00:02:18,794
As far as access to the industry...

43
00:02:20,214 --> 00:02:24,558
A little better, not a whole lot better. I would say companies have struggled to

44
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:28,662
understand how to recruit African Americans into the game industry. There are several

45
00:02:28,702 --> 00:02:31,845
organizations they could be looking at like NSBE, National Association of Black Engineers.

46
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:36,909
They seem to seem unaware of them or going to historically black colleges. And so there's just

47
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:42,734
a lack of response to making the teams more diverse in that regard. As far as

48
00:02:44,043 --> 00:02:45,204
How the industry actually works.

49
00:02:45,824 --> 00:02:48,285
One of the big issues that we've seen is retention.

50
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:55,230
Retaining African-American game industry has been a big challenge because of the work environments have not been almost,

51
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,112
from what I understand, not as welcoming as they should be.

52
00:03:00,108 --> 00:03:15,073
Yeah, I specifically would love to dig into that because I think one of the main things I want to get into here is not just getting more black folks, black and brown folks into the game industry at all levels, but keeping them there rather than sort of churning through them.

53
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:20,154
I think there's there's still a lot of I mean, there's a lot of work to be done in all corners of the industry, but especially in.

54
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:40,359
What's the process behind designing systems in studios and in companies that keep people feeling included, that keep people feeling they're part of the team, and sort of just minimize the level of and the amount of microaggressions that people who don't fit in with a company culture often deal with on a daily basis.

55
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:49,003
Do you think people who work in games, specifically like sort of levels of power whether it's, you know, seniority and such. How can they.

56
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:56,174
better design game companies and game teams to sort of keep people on the team who have

57
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,960
diverse perspectives, whether they're black developers, brown developers.

58
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:01,408
Human beings have a tendency, right?

59
00:04:01,968 --> 00:04:04,310
So like when we are successful at something,

60
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,212
we think that the duplication of that successful pattern

61
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:09,193
is the way to keep being successful, right?

62
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:11,695
So like, let's say you make a really great,

63
00:04:12,316 --> 00:04:14,718
magnificent game and it was 20 of you and your friends

64
00:04:14,778 --> 00:04:16,599
in a basement for 15 months

65
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,561
and you worked 60 hours a week to do it

66
00:04:19,681 --> 00:04:20,662
and you made it, right?

67
00:04:21,182 --> 00:04:23,244
And then it becomes wildly successful, right?

68
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:27,727
Then you're able to get VC money and make a company, right?

69
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:33,211
You think in your mind that the thing you did to make that game successful is the duplicatable

70
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:35,213
thing you should do to make the next game successful, right?

71
00:04:35,273 --> 00:04:37,034
So then you create what's called crunch, right?

72
00:04:37,074 --> 00:04:42,479
You create these ideas that that pattern has to be duplicated again and again to make new

73
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,119
games.

74
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:48,143
Rather than think that was a dysfunctional system that we did in the heat of the moment

75
00:04:48,203 --> 00:04:49,565
to make that one game.

76
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:54,497
Now how do we create a culture that allows that to be sustainable over time, right?

77
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:56,158
But we don't do it that way.

78
00:04:56,218 --> 00:04:57,678
We make it a provable model, right?

79
00:04:57,698 --> 00:05:01,860
So then we put everybody else through this system of callousness

80
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,681
so that they prove their worth, right?

81
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:08,602
And so then that particular kind of development.

82
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:13,828
then only seeks to serve a certain kind of person.

83
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:16,591
People in their 20s, people that are male,

84
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:18,954
because people that are female are not going to work

85
00:05:19,254 --> 00:05:21,697
60 hours a week with somebody, with men, late at night.

86
00:05:21,897 --> 00:05:22,598
That's not safe.

87
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:26,302
People that have a certain kind of cultural background,

88
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:27,783
right, because they can afford to do that.

89
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:33,211
and people that get along in after hours environments.

90
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:36,393
So you start creating this culture of an advantage,

91
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:38,354
because you start to look for people

92
00:05:38,394 --> 00:05:42,617
who have exactly the same cultural understanding as you do.

93
00:05:43,257 --> 00:05:44,738
And that's not only racial.

94
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:48,140
So then you look for who went to the same school as me,

95
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:51,783
who went to the same, who plays the same games as me,

96
00:05:52,163 --> 00:05:54,305
who's going to go to a lounge at 1130 at night

97
00:05:54,385 --> 00:05:55,325
and play a game late at night.

98
00:05:55,779 --> 00:06:02,232
You start looking at all these cultural connections that you deem as worthy

99
00:06:03,134 --> 00:06:04,677
of being part of the team, right?

100
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:08,354
So when then, your HR department, as you get bigger and bigger,

101
00:06:08,414 --> 00:06:11,995
your HR department expands, the team, when somebody comes in and says,

102
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:16,516
this is an odd way to do business, you feel offended by their approach, right?

103
00:06:16,536 --> 00:06:20,617
You feel offended that they are now encroaching upon your culture, right?

104
00:06:20,717 --> 00:06:23,058
Rather than saying this person may have a different perspective or

105
00:06:23,218 --> 00:06:24,739
healthier way of looking at this, right?

106
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:27,620
For instance, the game industry is not welcoming to parents.

107
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,222
Right? Or because they think, you know, you have to work all day long,

108
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:37,564
but parents might want to take off at two and come back at six. Right?

109
00:06:37,604 --> 00:06:41,646
Because the point in time for parents is pick up with kids, homework,

110
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,726
stuff like that. So like,

111
00:06:42,746 --> 00:06:45,087
there's things that you could do as a game industry that could be very,

112
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:49,669
very inclusive, but you think of it in a way of, Oh,

113
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:52,110
follow my pattern. My pattern is correct.

114
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:58,152
That way you create like a self-sustaining and sort of exclusionary system.

115
00:06:58,743 --> 00:07:04,586
Yes. And we got to break that system. A lot of questions in here in chat about how we're going

116
00:07:04,606 --> 00:07:09,128
to do that. I want to get to some real quick. Right here at the top of the list, Yusuf asks,

117
00:07:09,148 --> 00:07:13,690
when it comes to portrayal of one's ethnicity in video games, how does one who is on a lower level

118
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:18,853
express their disapproval of misrepresentation? For example, I'm Arab and I really dislike being

119
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:21,334
constantly portrayed as a terrorist, understandably.

120
00:07:22,895 --> 00:07:29,504
So he's asking his internally in his company, he wants to address a stereotype in the company

121
00:07:29,724 --> 00:07:32,287
that he thinks is portrayed not negatively.

122
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,573
So the way I would think about that would be three ways.

123
00:07:37,178 --> 00:07:41,119
The first is I would find a bunch of articles that support your point of view, right?

124
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:44,680
Like this is the way I find I read articles on actual stereotypes.

125
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,361
I find research about how they, how that portrays people in the news.

126
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:54,882
And I send that information to my immediate supervisors and say, hey, I want you to be aware

127
00:07:54,902 --> 00:07:58,142
of how this will affect the game to this particular group

128
00:07:58,182 --> 00:08:00,883
of people because it can affect sales, right?

129
00:08:01,403 --> 00:08:06,144
The second way is then to go to them personally and explain to them their point of view.

130
00:08:06,664 --> 00:08:08,408
and explain how it affects them personally, right?

131
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:11,194
The third way is as important as the three others, right?

132
00:08:11,715 --> 00:08:15,783
Is to have a general discussion with the team.

133
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:23,481
about why this particular character has to be this particular thing, right?

134
00:08:23,821 --> 00:08:25,843
There are plenty of ethnicities that could be terrorists, right?

135
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:26,964
Why does it have to be a Muslim?

136
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,586
And then, and also flip it, like, right?

137
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:33,889
So is the main character a standard James Bond character?

138
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,051
And could that be the Muslim character, right?

139
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:39,353
And so then give them another sense of, hey, why are we looking at,

140
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:41,635
let's flip the whole scenario on its head.

141
00:08:41,695 --> 00:08:43,797
Like, let's make the Muslim guy the hero.

142
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:44,137
I'll make the.

143
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:46,418
The other guy, the terrorist, right?

144
00:08:46,478 --> 00:08:50,041
And then suddenly that has creative interest.

145
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:50,821
Oh, well, how do we do that?

146
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:52,843
You know, questions will come up, right?

147
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:54,844
So like, kind of go all three.

148
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:57,385
So address first the audience issue,

149
00:08:57,906 --> 00:08:59,827
then address the personal issue

150
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:01,308
and address the creative issue.

151
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:02,449
You address all three.

152
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:05,551
Otherwise you get pushed back behind your back secretly,

153
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:06,231
in my opinion.

154
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:13,355
Do you think it's important to make a business case as well, or is that sort of beyond the

155
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,636
scope of an individual employee?

156
00:09:15,036 --> 00:09:16,317
You could make a business case.

157
00:09:16,518 --> 00:09:20,140
I think it'd be difficult in his position because he's a junior person, and that might

158
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,582
not be his scope of ability.

159
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:28,166
So I think he makes it if he says it makes sense to the audience because he can prove

160
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:28,387
that.

161
00:09:29,007 --> 00:09:30,308
And that's why you show articles.

162
00:09:30,348 --> 00:09:31,089
Because there's lots of...

163
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:32,990
He's got scholarly research you can find.

164
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:37,552
That shows negative portrayals of stereotypes in society, how they affect people's attitudes

165
00:09:37,573 --> 00:09:41,875
toward them, stuff like that. Once he gets in the business case, he's going to balance somebody from

166
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:46,297
an Ivy League school who's going to make another business case why it is important to do it.

167
00:09:46,357 --> 00:09:51,500
Yeah, all right. Well, we have another great question here. Actually, a lot of our questions,

168
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:57,483
thank you all so much. Tanya asks, how does a diverse team create a successful,

169
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:02,125
productive, and thriving environment as opposed to a non-diverse team?

170
00:10:02,323 --> 00:10:06,426
What are the ramifications of not striving to have a diverse team?

171
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:13,249
Apple, there's lots of, okay, this is a really complicated question.

172
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:13,569
Yeah.

173
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:17,191
So I talk about this quite often, right?

174
00:10:17,231 --> 00:10:20,013
So over-representation is an industry problem, right?

175
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:23,975
An over-representation is when you have a certain kind of person

176
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:26,856
representing so much of the team that...

177
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:34,740
They think that's normal, right? So if you have eight white guys on a team and then two ethnic guys from a different country,

178
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,022
and that's your team, and you think that's industry standard, that's like how it's supposed to work,

179
00:10:39,562 --> 00:10:46,065
that's how it's supposed to operate, right? And so then you, what you have is then lack of diversity of opinion.

180
00:10:46,624 --> 00:11:02,148
I got there's a perspective, like a diversity of approach, like a diversity of audience, like a diversity of laughings. And so you fit into all these different ideas of we're going to make what we we already know. And so that often is the problem with diverse teams is

181
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:06,901
They're trying to approach the problem from their perspective, only their perspective,

182
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:10,284
and they become a feeding zone of their own ideas.

183
00:11:10,765 --> 00:11:14,047
And they become support systems for the ideas they understand, right?

184
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:17,971
So there's nobody there to come in and say, hey, what about this?

185
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:19,352
What about this idea?

186
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:23,695
Because that gets a negative reaction because they've now set a standard.

187
00:11:24,496 --> 00:11:31,659
of what they deem is the best team. Right? And that that standard is a false narrative. They

188
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:35,841
don't know if that's the best team, but they set the standard of that so that they can target it.

189
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:36,001
Right.

190
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:43,051
I think I also like there is this is a preview of JDC summer day three tomorrow.

191
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:47,136
King's Sabrina Carmona will be giving a talk about how to cultivate more women in leadership

192
00:11:47,176 --> 00:11:47,596
and games.

193
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:47,877
Yes.

194
00:11:48,517 --> 00:11:51,941
And I know there's a bit in there where she happens to mention that there have been studies

195
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:56,626
done that show, you know, companies that have more diverse leadership teams that have women

196
00:11:56,686 --> 00:11:58,268
and non-white men.

197
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:05,599
are like more successful, measurably so, 15 to 35% more successful, in part because they have a broader

198
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,902
range of experiences to draw from and a broader range of perspectives to bring to bear in the

199
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:15,926
market. On that note too, if you look at undergraduate programs, minorities, I mean

200
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:21,170
marginalized people and women have more larger roles in leadership in undergraduate programs.

201
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:25,453
So they usually have more leadership experience coming out of undergraduate schools. Right.

202
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:27,835
And most white guys do, even though no one tells you that.

203
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:36,203
Look, if you call a campus and ask who are these on campus, largely they are underrepresented people because they come there to lead.

204
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:38,624
That's part of their mantra when they get to the school.

205
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:39,885
Absolutely.

206
00:12:40,485 --> 00:12:48,650
Before we get away from this, let's jump to another question here in chat. Jasmine asked a little while ago, I've heard that many game companies have a boys club vibe.

207
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:53,853
Would you share your experience with how exclusive these teams are or aren't? Do you ever not feel welcome?

208
00:12:55,225 --> 00:12:57,806
Yes, there's a couple of things I've been to.

209
00:12:57,826 --> 00:13:00,747
There's some exclusive kind of events

210
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:02,588
that once you get to a certain level

211
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:03,668
in the game industry, you go to.

212
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:07,630
And I've definitely felt targeted at those events sometimes

213
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,712
where somebody's pressing on my credentials

214
00:13:10,752 --> 00:13:14,413
or asking why I'm there, or how'd you get access to this,

215
00:13:14,954 --> 00:13:19,335
or this very strange dynamics to have.

216
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:24,257
There is a boys club, and that goes back,

217
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:26,378
but I think there's two different kinds.

218
00:13:26,398 --> 00:13:29,159
There's a boys club and there's a nerds club,

219
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,240
which both have their own kind of like weird

220
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:34,541
like rituals to get into, right?

221
00:13:34,561 --> 00:13:36,922
So there's definitely a boy vibe or like it's.

222
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,812
Locker room talk or whatever that might be.

223
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,753
But it's also like in a nerd club,

224
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:43,714
you don't fit into this nerd culture

225
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:45,735
and we're gonna make you feel excluded

226
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:48,097
because we're supposed to be the people

227
00:13:48,117 --> 00:13:48,938
in the industry like this.

228
00:13:49,438 --> 00:13:52,840
And so I think both of them exclusively do the shutouts

229
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,601
for different kinds of candidates

230
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:56,302
they feel don't belong in those clubs.

231
00:13:57,843 --> 00:14:00,245
Kevin has another good question.

232
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:01,846
He asks, thanks for taking questions,

233
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:03,347
which is just nice to share.

234
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:06,409
He wants to hear Carl, your take on job requirements.

235
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:09,779
and how job requirements can hinder minority job applicants.

236
00:14:10,179 --> 00:14:12,421
How can we as applicants better position ourselves

237
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:14,162
in the job market within the games industry?

238
00:14:15,002 --> 00:14:16,363
Oh, as the job applicant.

239
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:19,205
Yeah, how do you get around that HR wall?

240
00:14:19,345 --> 00:14:21,206
All right, HR walls are interesting.

241
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:22,627
All right, so there's a couple of different ways

242
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:23,247
you can do this, right?

243
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:25,609
So the best advice I ever got for this,

244
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:27,310
and I'm gonna give you two pieces of advice really quick.

245
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,511
The best advice I got for this

246
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:30,112
was one of my friends who works at Viacom.

247
00:14:30,672 --> 00:14:30,832
Yeah.

248
00:14:31,112 --> 00:14:32,393
And I was at Comic Con one year,

249
00:14:33,354 --> 00:14:34,614
and we were at backstage Key & Peele, right?

250
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,227
We got to choose some of the writers for Key and Peele, and the guys that we met were like 25.

251
00:14:45,447 --> 00:14:51,033
They couldn't be more football. And I was like super salty because I'm a writer and I'm like, how they?

252
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:57,478
At Key and Peele? I was mad about it. Like this is like seven years ago.

253
00:14:57,619 --> 00:15:01,682
So after drinks, we're talking and they explained that, you know, they took like

254
00:15:02,857 --> 00:15:05,838
secretary job, basically, for like six months, right?

255
00:15:06,258 --> 00:15:07,918
And then once they did the secretary job,

256
00:15:08,478 --> 00:15:10,119
then they like, you know, worked their way

257
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:10,699
into the writer's room.

258
00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:14,840
And so when they walked away, my friend goes,

259
00:15:15,961 --> 00:15:16,741
they made the leap.

260
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:18,641
And I go, what's the leap?

261
00:15:19,622 --> 00:15:22,983
And she says, they took the job they didn't want

262
00:15:23,103 --> 00:15:24,283
to get the job they did want.

263
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,824
And I was like, why would you do that?

264
00:15:27,864 --> 00:15:29,745
She said, because then you understand the network.

265
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:32,246
He said that people make, most people make mistakes on,

266
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:35,808
is that they don't get into the network first

267
00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:39,029
so that they can then appeal to the job they want to do.

268
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:41,470
They try to go for the job they want first,

269
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,231
not knowing anybody and then expecting,

270
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,612
so then it's all about credentials then, right?

271
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:50,013
So she said, take that job below you first.

272
00:15:50,093 --> 00:15:52,114
So like, go find the company you want,

273
00:15:52,174 --> 00:15:53,075
find three companies you want.

274
00:15:54,393 --> 00:15:57,513
Apply to the job there that is the job that gets you in the door.

275
00:15:57,754 --> 00:16:01,394
Like just, you know, you want to work with the company.

276
00:16:02,174 --> 00:16:06,235
Once there, spend all your time trying to figure out how to get out of that job

277
00:16:06,295 --> 00:16:10,676
and go to do what you want to do. But do the job well. Do the job super well.

278
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:13,937
Don't be really, really good at it. And then like immediately when

279
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:16,237
the presentation opens up, find the person that you're going to talk to.

280
00:16:16,257 --> 00:16:20,318
Because once you're in the club, people are more willing to help you. So like

281
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:23,799
once you work downstairs and you meet Matt in animation.

282
00:16:24,245 --> 00:16:26,546
Right? And you have lunch with Matt like 20 days in a row.

283
00:16:26,566 --> 00:16:28,307
Matt's going to ask you what you eventually want to do.

284
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:30,329
And you're going to like, oh, I want to be animator.

285
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:31,109
And he's going to like, okay.

286
00:16:31,289 --> 00:16:32,750
And then Matt will tell you at one point, hey,

287
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,491
they're looking for a storyboard artist and animation.

288
00:16:35,152 --> 00:16:36,473
Go talk to Rachel, right?

289
00:16:36,593 --> 00:16:40,655
And then suddenly you have an opportunity to do that versus saying, well,

290
00:16:40,675 --> 00:16:43,637
being online trying to approach and trying to get the storyboard job online

291
00:16:43,657 --> 00:16:44,838
without any assistance.

292
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:51,622
The second way is some companies have exams, tests, requirements,

293
00:16:51,863 --> 00:16:52,763
all these different things.

294
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,403
Spend some time researching the company about the processes of what they require to get in.

295
00:17:01,004 --> 00:17:08,568
So that means being on LinkedIn for like six weeks, hitting people on LinkedIn like,

296
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:10,089
hey, I want to talk to you about coming to Blizzard.

297
00:17:10,746 --> 00:17:11,306
How do I do that?

298
00:17:11,506 --> 00:17:15,107
You know, like, and don't hit them, like, ask people, like, one question.

299
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:16,988
Like, don't ask them more than one.

300
00:17:17,008 --> 00:17:20,089
Like, hi, my name is Ron, and I'm a student.

301
00:17:20,149 --> 00:17:23,169
I'm coming out, and I really think Blizzard's a great company.

302
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,890
What things about Blizzard do you think would be great?

303
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,371
You know, like, what things about, but you want to ask one question and one question

304
00:17:30,431 --> 00:17:30,631
only.

305
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:31,372
Don't waste your time.

306
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:34,753
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

307
00:17:35,073 --> 00:17:35,353
I want to.

308
00:17:36,153 --> 00:17:42,681
Pop over here to one Brian Francis who asked not a long while ago, what are reliable processes

309
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:46,665
for bringing in outside consultants to help talk about cultural identities developers

310
00:17:46,705 --> 00:17:48,707
may not know about or not know enough about.

311
00:17:49,028 --> 00:17:53,112
He's thinking specifically here about folks like the HUNA Heritage Foundation who helped

312
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:54,353
Donaud make Tell Me Why.

313
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,209
Ask the question again. I didn't quite understand it.

314
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:08,559
Absolutely. All he wants to know is what are some good processes for bringing in outside consultants to teams who can help them better represent and portray cultural identities and cultural groups?

315
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,601
Oh, gotcha.

316
00:18:11,662 --> 00:18:14,205
Um, that's a really great question.

317
00:18:14,854 --> 00:18:18,016
Yeah, have you had any experience with that kind of stuff as a consultant yourself?

318
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:25,682
I've never brought in outside groups for anything I've done, but I can, I can, I say first research who are the experts in that field.

319
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:31,806
And then talk to people that are in those fields and then watch stuff they do.

320
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:36,355
And then email the people at the company and once the end user has looked in and ask them,

321
00:18:36,395 --> 00:18:39,258
who are the top five groups you recommend me to talk about?

322
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,381
And then ask those people, top five, and make a list about 15 or 20.

323
00:18:43,082 --> 00:18:44,823
Like, don't stop at the first five you find.

324
00:18:45,544 --> 00:18:49,327
Go to those groups and find who they study and research and talk to, right?

325
00:18:49,368 --> 00:18:54,412
So, like, there's a network of people that are in each area that all have connections in that.

326
00:18:54,452 --> 00:18:56,214
So, don't stop with the first five.

327
00:18:56,754 --> 00:19:02,815
Like have each person recommend four or five people so you can research them all and a lot of times you'll find that there's

328
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:08,277
Some hidden people in those like people that are really good at research. Sometimes they're really bad at marketing

329
00:19:08,837 --> 00:19:13,398
Great. So like if you're like gonna think about well, I'm gonna go the person has the best website

330
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:16,498
That usually is the person that's best at marketing it, right?

331
00:19:16,618 --> 00:19:21,319
The person that's really good at researching all that stuff is probably like reading a book like they're not gonna mark

332
00:19:21,339 --> 00:19:24,760
They're not on social media, right? So like you have to like kind of do some do some digging

333
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:25,720
Financing

334
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:35,045
You're right, yeah. There's been a few questions about games specifically. I've tried to keep this mostly to game teams, but Tony had a good question for a little while ago.

335
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:43,871
You want to take a break and talk about which current games do you feel do a good job of portraying the realities of diversity and which ones handle that poorly?

336
00:19:44,372 --> 00:19:48,194
It's a really difficult question to answer.

337
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:51,247
Which games do a good job?

338
00:19:52,088 --> 00:19:53,690
That's a wide open question.

339
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:54,111
Games...

340
00:19:55,072 --> 00:19:57,755
There's lots of games that really do a good job of like avatar creation.

341
00:19:58,015 --> 00:20:01,499
Like that's a great way to think about like diversity in some respects.

342
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:02,440
But...

343
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:08,395
the games that portray cultures, like actually portray different cultures.

344
00:20:08,856 --> 00:20:12,962
There's Orion, a legend of the Koran, which is a great African-based Korean,

345
00:20:13,142 --> 00:20:15,205
which is really based on African mythology.

346
00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:19,651
That's a fantastic game. I think Black and Gaming gave it an award this year.

347
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:22,092
That's a really, really good one.

348
00:20:23,373 --> 00:20:25,133
There's a, there's a, I can't think of the name of the game.

349
00:20:25,153 --> 00:20:26,394
It's the Streets of Rage clone.

350
00:20:26,914 --> 00:20:27,534
That's really hilarious.

351
00:20:27,554 --> 00:20:28,654
Treasury in Beatdown City.

352
00:20:28,734 --> 00:20:29,595
Treasury in Beatdown City.

353
00:20:29,615 --> 00:20:30,335
That's a really great game.

354
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:31,515
Sean Alexander Allen.

355
00:20:31,555 --> 00:20:33,576
Yep.

356
00:20:33,756 --> 00:20:37,677
I love, it's a hilarious like game that Momo created.

357
00:20:37,777 --> 00:20:41,578
It's about hair slapping.

358
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:42,699
It's hilarious.

359
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:44,559
Like it's about someone touching your hair.

360
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:45,419
Yeah.

361
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,140
Yeah.

362
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,540
There's, there's some really good like.

363
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,604
Um, there's some good games coming up. I know Jabari Ali is really doing some really cool things with his new game coming out.

364
00:20:53,804 --> 00:20:57,246
Uh, that's doing like four months and he's doing Alpha for it.

365
00:20:57,987 --> 00:21:05,311
Um, yeah, there's a couple of great ones. For AAA studios, I mean, obviously, like, Miles Morales' Spiderman is going to be great.

366
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:06,652
It's coming out on PlayStation.

367
00:21:07,072 --> 00:21:07,412
Yeah.

368
00:21:09,036 --> 00:21:13,679
I really like what Horizon Dawn has done with the female protagonists in that game.

369
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:15,881
That's a really good representation of things.

370
00:21:16,321 --> 00:21:23,265
The issue here, though, is if you're only 2% of the industry, and you're not in positions of power in the industry,

371
00:21:23,705 --> 00:21:30,330
it's tough because nobody in decision-making capabilities is a person that has the power to say,

372
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,935
We're going to take these cultural milestones and put them in the game.

373
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:39,000
So now you're, now everybody's in the guy's position to ask the question.

374
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,483
Earlier is you're arguing up, right?

375
00:21:41,623 --> 00:21:47,130
So if you want better representation, you have to put people in power and position

376
00:21:47,591 --> 00:21:49,033
that can then fight for those decisions.

377
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:55,914
Yeah, I mean, that kind of calls back to what we were talking about earlier about the importance of having diverse leadership teams.

378
00:21:55,934 --> 00:22:08,705
Do you have any sort of contemporary thoughts on how marginalized folks, black folks, other folks can get and keep jobs in the higher roles of game development where they can actually exercise that kind of power?

379
00:22:10,226 --> 00:22:12,468
Oh, so my thought would be this.

380
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,192
So the first approach to it is to think about

381
00:22:18,405 --> 00:22:22,088
All right, does this person have capability to run a team?

382
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,990
Right, and that's usually yes, right,

383
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,972
because they wouldn't be in your situation

384
00:22:27,032 --> 00:22:29,214
if they weren't capable of running a team, right?

385
00:22:29,874 --> 00:22:31,315
The second question then is,

386
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:35,499
do I trust them to run the team, right?

387
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,681
And so if those two are the answer you have

388
00:22:38,722 --> 00:22:39,362
and you're in charge,

389
00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:42,465
that should be the end of your conversation, right?

390
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:45,407
What happens too often is you look for fit.

391
00:22:46,967 --> 00:22:51,970
And fit is the easiest way to disqualify a minority from a team.

392
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:58,776
Because it gives people a weird amount of power in decision making without reason.

393
00:22:59,556 --> 00:23:02,859
Right? So I can just say I don't really feel it.

394
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,381
And not give you a reason why.

395
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:06,722
I don't really think it's a good fit.

396
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:12,769
And what they're saying is they're uncomfortable with this person being in the role, right?

397
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:16,630
But that person is going to be uncomfortable because you're now asking them to be

398
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,571
in a role they're not used to serving in.

399
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,471
They're not maybe used to serving this kind of person, this person being in charge of them.

400
00:23:23,491 --> 00:23:26,112
They're not used to this kind of person having power over them.

401
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:27,672
They're not used to this person serving.

402
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:33,334
So don't take the fit discussion out of your questioning.

403
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:37,095
If you believe as the people that are in charge that this person has capability,

404
00:23:38,055 --> 00:23:41,196
and can do the job, that should be the end of the discussion, right?

405
00:23:41,216 --> 00:23:45,156
Because you, because then you have to tell the team, look, if you don't,

406
00:23:45,176 --> 00:23:47,437
it's not a good fit, then you need to move on.

407
00:23:48,817 --> 00:23:51,738
But imagine, and this is something I think I'm going to tell the audience real,

408
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:57,579
imagine that you're going into position where you're going to supervise people, right?

409
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:03,560
And they have the power before you get hired and after you get hired to tell your boss

410
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,861
that you're not a good fit, and you need to go on.

411
00:24:07,586 --> 00:24:09,707
That's such a disempowering idea.

412
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:13,268
The person in charge hired you to the job,

413
00:24:13,648 --> 00:24:16,849
but the people under you have a card to play constantly

414
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:19,090
because they have a team to say,

415
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,291
yeah, just not feeling it, right?

416
00:24:23,131 --> 00:24:24,892
And that can't work.

417
00:24:25,332 --> 00:24:29,353
If you want it to succeed, you've gotta give them autonomy.

418
00:24:30,313 --> 00:24:33,294
Yeah, I think you're right.

419
00:24:35,324 --> 00:24:38,487
So I kind of want to stay on the topic of hiring real quick and maybe,

420
00:24:38,507 --> 00:24:43,130
sure, yeah, I can, it can be, it is frustrating to have people say, well,

421
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:45,672
we would have more diverse teams if more diverse people would apply.

422
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:50,476
Because that's BS. It's on people who hire to hire good diverse candidates.

423
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:55,380
But if folks who are hiring maybe really don't know where to look and are having a hard time.

424
00:24:55,868 --> 00:24:59,510
Pat in chat asks, can you direct us to a list of resources for hiring?

425
00:24:59,851 --> 00:25:01,992
For example, you mentioned the Society of Black Engineers.

426
00:25:02,392 --> 00:25:05,594
Knowing some of the best places to reach out or post would be really helpful.

427
00:25:05,614 --> 00:25:07,215
Do you have any suggestions?

428
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:09,036
Yes. All right.

429
00:25:09,136 --> 00:25:13,758
So once again, if you're about programming, National Society of Black Engineers,

430
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,699
there's 10,000 members of that.

431
00:25:15,719 --> 00:25:20,462
You can find somebody who's computer engineering with that group.

432
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:24,344
If you want to get more diverse artists, right, start an art station.

433
00:25:24,742 --> 00:25:28,327
Look at Comic-Con situations.

434
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:30,650
Look at people that are trying to do 3D art.

435
00:25:31,151 --> 00:25:34,516
Lots of people that are coming from African-Americans.

436
00:25:34,756 --> 00:25:35,818
This is the first thing to start here.

437
00:25:36,018 --> 00:25:37,019
Okay, let's start right here.

438
00:25:38,684 --> 00:25:43,748
The African Americans who are applying to the game industry are doing so in a way

439
00:25:44,048 --> 00:25:48,132
that is against the culture that they come from, right?

440
00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:51,636
It's hard to explain to your parents who invested, I don't know,

441
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:54,758
how many thousand dollars into your education that you're going to leave and not go

442
00:25:54,778 --> 00:25:57,020
into banking because you want to do video games, right?

443
00:25:57,401 --> 00:26:00,103
So this is a person who's already rebelling against the system, right?

444
00:26:00,962 --> 00:26:06,107
Sometimes they're coming from very small communities, right?

445
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:09,850
They don't have a team around them that can do their art, can do their music,

446
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:10,531
can do all of that stuff.

447
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:13,714
It's maybe one or two people coming from that environment, right?

448
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:17,078
So the first part of that is to understand that you're looking

449
00:26:17,118 --> 00:26:19,280
for somebody sometimes that's alone, right?

450
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,164
So your first job is to make them feel welcome to even apply to your organization.

451
00:26:23,524 --> 00:26:24,525
They may be intimidated.

452
00:26:25,145 --> 00:26:27,467
I can't possibly work at Sony.

453
00:26:27,727 --> 00:26:28,728
I can't possibly work at Sony.

454
00:26:28,748 --> 00:26:29,789
You have to be encouraging.

455
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:30,549
Like, yeah, you can.

456
00:26:30,949 --> 00:26:31,610
I've seen your art.

457
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:32,390
It's amazing.

458
00:26:32,831 --> 00:26:33,711
Go ahead and apply.

459
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:34,152
Right?

460
00:26:34,212 --> 00:26:35,232
Like, that's the first part.

461
00:26:35,252 --> 00:26:44,999
The second part is get off of the Berkeley-Stanford course.

462
00:26:46,834 --> 00:26:49,795
Game industry, you are enamored with these schools.

463
00:26:49,855 --> 00:26:52,656
You have to stop if you want to diversify your pool, right?

464
00:26:52,776 --> 00:26:54,697
Look at some HBCUs down south.

465
00:26:54,897 --> 00:26:57,178
Look at some of the schools across the country.

466
00:26:57,758 --> 00:27:00,519
There is a lie in the industry that's pervasive.

467
00:27:00,939 --> 00:27:02,440
And the pervasive thing in the industry

468
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,221
is you have these litmus tests to get into a company

469
00:27:07,121 --> 00:27:09,182
that once they're in, they're going to get retrained anyway.

470
00:27:11,027 --> 00:27:12,569
Mike, what are you doing?

471
00:27:12,649 --> 00:27:16,736
Like if you don't even need the information to apply to work,

472
00:27:17,357 --> 00:27:19,601
why is information so important when you apply?

473
00:27:19,661 --> 00:27:22,165
So if you know as a hiring manager,

474
00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:23,908
they're going to retrain them for three months anyway.

475
00:27:24,628 --> 00:27:26,309
Right? Throw away the wheel.

476
00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:28,710
Okay, what are you looking for as far as personality?

477
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,611
What are you looking for as far as fit?

478
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:33,652
And by fit, I mean are they a nice person to work with?

479
00:27:33,712 --> 00:27:34,833
Are they good to be around?

480
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:38,955
What are you looking for as far as like outside thought and talent?

481
00:27:39,275 --> 00:27:39,535
Right?

482
00:27:39,876 --> 00:27:43,938
You know, ideally they have to have a certain amount of blah

483
00:27:44,338 --> 00:27:45,779
so that they can fit your company, right?

484
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:46,899
Like that doesn't matter.

485
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:48,800
If you don't even use Maya in your company,

486
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,741
why is Maya required on your website?

487
00:27:50,781 --> 00:27:51,441
Like stop that.

488
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:52,262
Like just...

489
00:27:53,082 --> 00:27:53,303
Stop.

490
00:27:53,383 --> 00:27:53,904
Mm-hm.

491
00:27:54,004 --> 00:27:54,285
Mm-hm.

492
00:27:54,746 --> 00:27:55,387
It's 12 Maya.

493
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,111
Just, yeah, because that's right.

494
00:27:57,131 --> 00:27:57,592
It's the right passage.

495
00:27:57,612 --> 00:27:58,273
Everybody else does.

496
00:27:58,414 --> 00:27:59,296
It's the right passage, right?

497
00:27:59,316 --> 00:27:59,416
Yeah.

498
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,572
Well, this has been such a good talk that I forgot to give everyone the five minute warning.

499
00:28:04,632 --> 00:28:06,272
So we got about a minute and a half left.

500
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:11,034
But as we close out, I want to try and get to some of the questions we missed.

501
00:28:11,054 --> 00:28:12,695
There was at least one real quick.

502
00:28:12,855 --> 00:28:17,296
Eve Creviche, a speaker here at GDC Summer, asked, you know,

503
00:28:17,356 --> 00:28:22,858
tell me back to what you called like patterns of of culture that sort of homogenize studios and teams.

504
00:28:23,198 --> 00:28:27,740
She says, well, you're calling patterns I call cultural myths, but you kind of make it sound like hazing.

505
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,081
Is hazing like an appropriate way to think about it?

506
00:28:30,964 --> 00:28:43,572
Some I think there are there can be versions of hazing, but I think people sometimes people that think you have to go through this so I can you get feel worthy, and there's unconscious bias right unconscious biases.

507
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:45,073
Hey, we do this thing.

508
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:48,833
and you don't want to do it so you're not going to be included.

509
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:51,414
But they don't, they don't, they're not doing it to make you feel bad.

510
00:28:51,434 --> 00:28:54,114
They just feel like you don't want to, they will look at it like you don't want

511
00:28:54,134 --> 00:28:55,535
to be included in our, in our thing.

512
00:28:55,855 --> 00:28:56,075
Right.

513
00:28:56,135 --> 00:28:57,655
So we all eat pizza.

514
00:28:57,715 --> 00:29:00,276
You don't eat, you know, like I'm a Chicago pizza stop.

515
00:29:00,296 --> 00:29:00,876
I come from Chicago.

516
00:29:01,296 --> 00:29:01,476
Right.

517
00:29:01,496 --> 00:29:03,376
So I would never eat California pizza.

518
00:29:03,396 --> 00:29:05,697
Like I would think that's like, right.

519
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:10,198
So like if, but they're going to like this California pizza spot to eat every Friday.

520
00:29:10,358 --> 00:29:11,398
And I'm like, I'm fries.

521
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,498
I'm like, I would never go to.

522
00:29:13,073 --> 00:29:18,337
It's a spot like that's ridiculous. So I don't go right and they're like Carl doesn't wanna bond with us, right?

523
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:24,702
Like I like I just don't care if California says nothing to do with you like like but those are things I think that there's like

524
00:29:25,262 --> 00:29:30,186
Uncultured unconscious bias that happens and the bias can it over time?

525
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,568
Become exclusion exclusionary, right?

526
00:29:33,168 --> 00:29:38,132
But I also think she's right there are kinds of kinds of hazing where they want you to go through kind of like the same

527
00:29:39,299 --> 00:29:41,320
grit they went through to prove yourself.

528
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,081
And that's wrong.

529
00:29:42,401 --> 00:29:43,162
That's wrong on every level.

530
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:44,923
Yeah, I think you're right.

531
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:46,465
Carl, thank you so much for joining us today.

532
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:47,405
This has been fantastic.

533
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:48,927
Thank you for having me.

534
00:29:49,427 --> 00:29:49,767
Yeah, man.

535
00:29:49,948 --> 00:29:50,808
All right, y'all take it easy.

536
00:29:50,828 --> 00:29:53,210
Enjoy the rest of your GDC and have a great evening.
