1
00:00:06,855 --> 00:00:10,098
This is Hutch, fantastic mistakes and how to avoid them.

2
00:00:10,098 --> 00:00:11,299
Thank you very much for coming.

3
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:13,821
I'm Andy Watson and I'm the COO of Hutch.

4
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:16,384
And we'll be talking about the mistakes

5
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:19,887
and learnings of Hutch, focusing on the last five years

6
00:00:19,887 --> 00:00:22,469
that have led Hutch to becoming a profitable studio.

7
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:24,090
So you don't have to make the same mistakes

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:24,751
that we've made.

9
00:00:25,252 --> 00:00:32,015
The reasons behind this talk, I wanted to talk about Hutch because I think the growth profile is very different to a lot of other studios.

10
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:37,237
I think most studios have a really big hit or significant amount of funding,

11
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:42,600
whereas Hutch has had a very modest success in the beginning and have grown quite responsibly after that.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,281
There's some common themes that I'm going to keep coming back to.

13
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:53,004
Lean culture, for us, lean isn't about building cheap and ugly games, it's about building for design efficiency.

14
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:56,014
Once you accept that designs are an assumption,

15
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,674
and you can build the core value of the game, the MVP,

16
00:00:58,674 --> 00:01:00,575
and focus on the viable,

17
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:02,435
you can increase your speed to learning,

18
00:01:02,435 --> 00:01:04,615
to understand the value to players.

19
00:01:04,615 --> 00:01:06,536
I'm not talking about the soft launch though.

20
00:01:06,536 --> 00:01:08,636
I'm talking about before you've committed

21
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,136
to making your game.

22
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,917
Break one rule.

23
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:13,217
This is an internal term we use,

24
00:01:13,217 --> 00:01:15,757
and it's about understanding your references,

25
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:17,838
understanding the risks you're taking,

26
00:01:17,838 --> 00:01:20,938
and only innovating in a way that adds value

27
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:22,238
to your players and to the game.

28
00:01:22,998 --> 00:01:28,000
and invest in your team. This seems really obvious, but you'd be surprised how many studios

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,382
don't do this. Your team are the ones making the day-to-day decisions, so sharing positive

30
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:36,723
and negative performance with them and never taking learning for granted.

31
00:01:36,723 --> 00:01:44,566
Just a little bit about Hutch. We're a company of 60 people spread across two studios. The

32
00:01:44,566 --> 00:01:49,067
London studio focuses on the creative aspect of games development, allowing our Canada

33
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:52,188
studio to focus on tools, technology and ports.

34
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:59,471
Hutch was founded in 2011 by five ex-Sony developers.

35
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:01,934
They'd been there between five and ten years each,

36
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:03,595
all working on console games,

37
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:06,918
but they'd never actually managed to get a game released.

38
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,040
And they wanted to go through that cathartic exercise

39
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,781
of getting something into players' hands.

40
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:13,904
So the studio was really born out of a sense of frustration.

41
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:18,416
So all their experience was that Sony, and Sony is all about innovation,

42
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:23,260
so they saw an opportunity to innovate and make a mobile-first racing control system.

43
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,523
So they made a paid game in Smash Cops,

44
00:02:25,523 --> 00:02:29,326
and they were a little bit lucky with featuring, and they made about a million dollars.

45
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:32,689
And in 2012, they saw the market evolving towards free-to-play.

46
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:37,314
So they integrated some light free-to-play mechanics into Smash Cops to create Smash Cops Heat.

47
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:44,079
And they found it quite a humbling experience and realised they're only just dipping their toes into the water of free-to-play.

48
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:48,763
They made a little bit more money, but they realised if you want to make the most of free-to-play,

49
00:02:48,763 --> 00:02:52,586
you need to build something from the ground up with free-to-play knowledge

50
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:56,029
and really invest in bringing free-to-play experience into the team.

51
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:58,071
And that's when we built Smash Bandits.

52
00:02:59,453 --> 00:03:02,194
So I joined halfway through the development of Smash Bandits,

53
00:03:02,194 --> 00:03:06,036
and I'd worked at Glue, Playfish, and EA Mobile

54
00:03:06,036 --> 00:03:09,037
on some really big, successful free-to-play products,

55
00:03:09,037 --> 00:03:11,598
but also some massive flops.

56
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:14,319
So I understood how brutal and fragile

57
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,000
the free-to-play market could be.

58
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:21,570
But there was this emergent culture that you needed to innovate to succeed was a pillar

59
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,931
at Hutch as opposed to learning from successes at the App Store.

60
00:03:24,931 --> 00:03:27,331
And it was creating this reliance on featuring.

61
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:29,632
So we were always swimming upstream.

62
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:33,293
And we were building great games, but we weren't building great businesses.

63
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:36,814
And every free-to-play game needs to be able to exist as a business.

64
00:03:36,814 --> 00:03:40,134
And champions of gameplay was another pillar.

65
00:03:40,134 --> 00:03:43,295
And champions of gameplay is great, and it's something we still do.

66
00:03:43,295 --> 00:03:46,996
But you cannot do that at the cost of building a deep metagame.

67
00:03:47,636 --> 00:03:50,399
and copying and referencing other games were almost dirty words,

68
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:52,541
and that was founded in the desire to innovate,

69
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,404
and that really affected the development of Smash Bandits,

70
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:58,626
and that's the first game I'm going to talk about in any detail.

71
00:04:01,412 --> 00:04:04,493
But this is called Fantastic Mistakes, so I'm going to get straight into it.

72
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:06,674
Smash Bandits is a great game, it's just not a business.

73
00:04:06,674 --> 00:04:09,776
What we wanted to make was an endless runner.

74
00:04:09,776 --> 00:04:15,879
Casual, accessible, mass market with short gameplay sessions and a deep meta game with

75
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:20,781
significant monetization potential, durable and consumable content.

76
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:25,724
What we actually made was a highly skilled core gameplay experience,

77
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,846
not casual or accessible at all,

78
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:32,128
with a light metagame that didn't create enough reason for players to monetise

79
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:34,790
and incredibly difficult to operate as a service.

80
00:04:35,522 --> 00:04:36,403
we weren't lean at all.

81
00:04:36,403 --> 00:04:40,386
If you look at the screenshots, it's full of great gameplay.

82
00:04:40,386 --> 00:04:43,149
It had a procedurally generated open world environment

83
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,091
that went from cities to water levels to canyons,

84
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:49,054
which is insane when we look back at it.

85
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:51,096
It had no soft launch.

86
00:04:51,096 --> 00:04:54,639
We used SmashCop's performance as validation for it,

87
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,600
and we indulged the studio's desire

88
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,023
to create and be creative and innovate.

89
00:05:00,023 --> 00:05:02,505
Ultimately, we built the game for ourselves.

90
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,809
And we broke all the rules.

91
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:09,291
There's nothing like Smash Bandits in the market.

92
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:13,294
It had a new gameplay system for free-to-play, a new metagame system.

93
00:05:13,294 --> 00:05:15,735
There was nothing in the market that players could reference.

94
00:05:15,735 --> 00:05:17,817
They had no familiar experience.

95
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,559
And we didn't understand the model we were trying to use.

96
00:05:20,559 --> 00:05:25,022
It wasn't accessible, it wasn't mass casual, and it had really long session times.

97
00:05:26,178 --> 00:05:30,341
So when we look at the revenue and the downloads, you see these shark fin revenue charts, which

98
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:34,263
grow a little over time, that shows there was a little bit of learning, but every update

99
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:37,985
was focused on innovation and skill-based features.

100
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:43,609
There was very minimal metagame stuff, we were really just skirting with free-to-play.

101
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:48,592
And the company has always been consistently able to get lots and lots of installs, but

102
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:50,113
not been able to monetize them.

103
00:05:50,413 --> 00:05:55,276
That meant our LTV wasn't growing enough with the updates, so our LTV to CPI ratio was never

104
00:05:55,276 --> 00:05:58,397
enough on Smash Bandits to be able to do meaningful UA.

105
00:05:58,397 --> 00:06:03,700
And if you look at it, we've got this console mentality of these big updates, so big releases,

106
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,782
so we weren't understanding our references and it was just feeding our desire to innovate.

107
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:14,525
And all of this could have been avoided if we'd understood what players really wanted

108
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:15,926
and created value for them.

109
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:19,222
So it comes back to those core themes.

110
00:06:19,222 --> 00:06:20,904
Evolve a lean culture.

111
00:06:20,904 --> 00:06:24,046
Smash Bandits could have been validated in two months

112
00:06:24,046 --> 00:06:26,849
rather than waiting the nine months to release it.

113
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:28,510
And then we would have built a better game

114
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,871
or a different game.

115
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:31,152
We didn't break one rule.

116
00:06:31,152 --> 00:06:34,835
We broke all the rules and had crazy levels of innovation.

117
00:06:36,847 --> 00:06:38,928
But we were starting to invest in our team.

118
00:06:38,928 --> 00:06:41,509
We were transparent with what worked and what didn't work.

119
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:44,469
And the team were beginning to learn from these mistakes.

120
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:45,570
And you can't teach that.

121
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:49,151
Seeing a great game that doesn't work as a business

122
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:50,831
is an incredible experience for the team,

123
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:52,592
and you can't buy that experience.

124
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:54,112
And the team were beginning to understand

125
00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:55,773
what risks they could take.

126
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,975
So we moved on to make MMX Racing.

127
00:06:59,975 --> 00:07:02,757
MMX Racing we made in nine months with nine developers,

128
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:04,038
and it cost about a million dollars,

129
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:06,459
and to date has 25 million downloads.

130
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:08,661
What we wanted to make was a drag racing game

131
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,601
with monster trucks.

132
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:11,222
We felt there was an opportunity.

133
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,664
In the drag racing space, we felt all the players

134
00:07:13,664 --> 00:07:14,825
were focused on the rev counter

135
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:16,205
and the gear changing mechanics,

136
00:07:16,205 --> 00:07:17,826
and we wanted to focus the player

137
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:19,628
on the truck and the environment.

138
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:22,950
So we stayed really close to our reference points.

139
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,071
Drag racing games are simple and accessible.

140
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:28,814
and we ensured that MMX Racing was simple and accessible.

141
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:33,699
MMX Racing was a really successful title for us and we learned a lot.

142
00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:36,261
We supported it for 18 months post launch.

143
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:40,906
It cost about a million dollars to make and to date has grossed about 10 million back.

144
00:07:40,906 --> 00:07:45,290
So we stayed close to our references, but Hutch will always innovate, but that needs

145
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,792
to be justified and you need to understand the risks.

146
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:52,036
We did make mistakes with it, so we did a big multiplayer update.

147
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:54,418
The whole game of MMX Racing took nine months.

148
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:56,960
Multiplayer took eight months after launch to make.

149
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,783
And we guessed what we thought the core value was and built it.

150
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:01,504
And we did validate with an audience.

151
00:08:01,504 --> 00:08:05,027
And it was nowhere near as good as it could have been.

152
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:07,930
And ultimately, with MMX Racing, supporting it for 18 months

153
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,530
was too long.

154
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,031
And we kept the team on it for too long.

155
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:15,746
When you look at the downloads and revenue charts, you'll see we had this massive launch.

156
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:16,346
This is just on iOS.

157
00:08:16,346 --> 00:08:19,667
We did four million downloads on iOS alone.

158
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:22,948
But we didn't make the most of it because we didn't validate early.

159
00:08:22,948 --> 00:08:29,330
We did multiple updates with WWE, car crushing, fusing systems, chat systems, and multiplayer.

160
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:36,612
You can see there's no real significant impact on the revenue post-launch because we didn't

161
00:08:36,612 --> 00:08:37,992
validate with a live audience.

162
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:41,571
And you can see that on those charts.

163
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:46,035
The one big update that we did that had the biggest change was we changed the tutorial

164
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:47,797
and that increased our LTV by 30%.

165
00:08:47,797 --> 00:08:53,882
And that's what pushed us over the LTV to CPI ratio that allowed us to do user acquisition.

166
00:08:53,882 --> 00:08:58,967
And it coined this term in the studio that featuring is for a week, but LTV is for life.

167
00:08:58,967 --> 00:09:01,309
And later on that led for us to make top drives.

168
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:03,051
And I'll talk about that a little bit later.

169
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,793
But, so because that biggest change was down to the tutorial,

170
00:09:07,793 --> 00:09:10,977
we could have made that earlier if we'd been lean and we'd validated early

171
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:12,979
and we would have had a better product for it.

172
00:09:12,979 --> 00:09:16,162
So we'd improved in some ways, we'd understood our reference

173
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:17,744
and we'd built out that core experience.

174
00:09:17,744 --> 00:09:21,508
And we'd done it without overindulging our sense of need to be creative.

175
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,104
But once you accept that all your designs are an assumption,

176
00:09:27,104 --> 00:09:29,247
you're really only guessing what players want.

177
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:31,229
And if you don't validate, you're gambling,

178
00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:32,330
and you're assuming you're right,

179
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,993
and you just continue down one path until you launch it,

180
00:09:34,993 --> 00:09:35,834
and then you find out.

181
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:40,379
But what players actually want can be really quite far away

182
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,500
from your initial assumption.

183
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:47,040
So by validating early with a live audience, you get one step closer to understanding every time

184
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,962
and improving that product, and the earlier the better.

185
00:09:49,962 --> 00:09:51,904
And there's more scope for improvement.

186
00:09:51,904 --> 00:09:57,508
And this all seems really obvious, but not many studios do it or even believe it's possible.

187
00:09:57,508 --> 00:10:00,910
And if you wait until your soft launch period to do it, it's already too late.

188
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,173
You can do this stuff before you commit to developing your game,

189
00:10:04,173 --> 00:10:07,756
so you know you're developing the right game from the beginning.

190
00:10:07,756 --> 00:10:10,558
So we wanted to solve all these mistakes going forward.

191
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:14,451
we'd released MMX Racing in 2014.

192
00:10:14,451 --> 00:10:18,817
And the team was supporting MX Racing until late 2015.

193
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:22,301
So after that massive launch,

194
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:24,945
and our UA understanding it had proved,

195
00:10:24,945 --> 00:10:27,608
we were quite confident

196
00:10:27,608 --> 00:10:29,490
with our free-to-play strategy going forward.

197
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:34,026
We had the opportunity to work with this amazing external team,

198
00:10:34,026 --> 00:10:38,652
the team behind CSR Classics and the product owner from CSR Racing.

199
00:10:38,652 --> 00:10:42,257
Now CSR is a $200 million franchise,

200
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:44,760
so that's great expertise and it was only 50 miles away.

201
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:52,749
in Brighton. And we had this great idea. Drifting is massive. Jim Carner has huge views on social

202
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:57,614
media and drifting has become more prevalent in popular culture thanks to the emergence of Ken

203
00:10:57,614 --> 00:11:02,599
Block. And there are great examples of drifting games doing well in Asia with games like Drift

204
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:07,845
Spirits. So we saw this opportunity to make the player feel awesome with an accessible drifting

205
00:11:07,845 --> 00:11:08,165
mechanic.

206
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:14,009
So it felt like the stars had really aligned for Race Kings and we were all really excited.

207
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:17,332
And we were going to validate early in a way that we hadn't done before.

208
00:11:17,332 --> 00:11:19,574
And we were going to do it before we'd made a commitment to the project.

209
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:22,276
And we were going to build a business as well of building a great game.

210
00:11:22,276 --> 00:11:24,438
And we were going to invest in understanding references.

211
00:11:25,632 --> 00:11:29,173
So Race Kings was meant to be 8-ball pool combined with Racing Rivals.

212
00:11:29,173 --> 00:11:32,834
Both huge titles, both top 20 grossing.

213
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:36,215
8-ball pool had this accessible multiplayer betting structure

214
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:40,116
and Racing Rivals had this deep metagame with a player-focused experience.

215
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:45,157
We were going to combine those to make a competitive, synchronous, multiplayer, drifting game.

216
00:11:46,077 --> 00:11:50,859
So we set out to make Race Kings with nine developers in a year at the cost of about a million dollars.

217
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:52,759
So very similar to MMX Racing.

218
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:58,781
And our teams are an autonomous mixture of art, design, production, QA, engineering and analytics.

219
00:11:58,781 --> 00:12:02,762
And that's a model that's worked really well for us in the past.

220
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:09,349
What actually happened is it took an average of 12 developers, 3 years and 3.8 million

221
00:12:09,349 --> 00:12:13,891
dollars to build Race Kings and it was only downloaded 6 million times despite having

222
00:12:13,891 --> 00:12:15,432
the best featuring we've ever had.

223
00:12:15,432 --> 00:12:20,474
So the main banner on the iOS store and Android stores worldwide.

224
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:24,956
So put that into context, our other titles have been downloaded 160 million times.

225
00:12:24,956 --> 00:12:30,899
So it was our most expensive development to date and our worst performing title.

226
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:33,215
So what went wrong?

227
00:12:33,215 --> 00:12:36,816
We were misaligned with our development

228
00:12:36,816 --> 00:12:37,597
with the external studio.

229
00:12:37,597 --> 00:12:40,537
We wanted to empower them to make a great game

230
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:43,658
as they'd done before and we knew they were capable of.

231
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:45,378
And we wanted them to benefit from the learnings

232
00:12:45,378 --> 00:12:48,099
we'd had on Smash Bandits and MMX Racing.

233
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:50,620
We wanted to justify our investment in drifting

234
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,340
by validating early, but we'd underestimated

235
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:55,321
how necessary the process we'd been through

236
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:56,821
had been to our learning.

237
00:12:56,821 --> 00:13:00,242
And it's very difficult and sometimes impossible

238
00:13:00,242 --> 00:13:00,702
to teach that.

239
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:08,226
The product lead had come from CSR Racing and he was new to Hutch, and we weren't fair to him.

240
00:13:08,226 --> 00:13:11,229
We expected him to represent our culture and our values.

241
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:16,794
But he'd come from a $200 million franchise, and he wanted to make a $500 million game.

242
00:13:18,023 --> 00:13:22,385
We had come from a $10 million product and we were looking to take that next big step

243
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,645
to be a $50 million product.

244
00:13:23,645 --> 00:13:27,387
So his desire to make this massive game meant innovating across the board.

245
00:13:27,387 --> 00:13:31,969
So Race Kings was built as if success was a foregone conclusion and he was addressing

246
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:36,351
the design decision, design problems that a $200 million game would have.

247
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:42,655
And this created a real cultural issue for us, because our culture is about empowering the team.

248
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:48,659
But they'd only worked on massive successes and they were prepared to innovate everywhere because they had so much confidence.

249
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:52,221
But they didn't understand how fragile free-to-play could be.

250
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:55,303
And we as a company were running before we could walk.

251
00:13:55,303 --> 00:13:59,425
We were only a company of 30 people and we weren't geared up to run another studio.

252
00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:05,123
So we had this ambition of validating early, but it's not always that easy.

253
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:09,248
The business value for RaceKings was set in this high visual benchmark,

254
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:13,312
licensed content and synchronous multiplayer, and that takes time,

255
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:14,714
and time increases your risk.

256
00:14:14,714 --> 00:14:17,837
And if that's the value, how can you create an MVP?

257
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:23,159
So instead we did user tests, focus groups, player diaries and expert reviews.

258
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:27,621
All really useful, but none are a replacement for early validation.

259
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:33,963
Getting that quantitative data early and from a live player base before you've made that commitment to building it.

260
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:40,035
Now a lot of studios have talked about validation, about the MVP, and they say the audience is

261
00:14:40,035 --> 00:14:43,879
too sophisticated now, that the market has progressed, and a lot of studios get bogged

262
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,742
down on the M, the minimum of MVP.

263
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:49,086
But at Hutch we focus on the viable nature, not the minimum.

264
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:53,371
So towards the end of development of Race Kings we took two people off the project for

265
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:54,713
two months to make a prototype.

266
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:58,636
and you can see it on the right, and that had no tutorial.

267
00:14:58,636 --> 00:15:01,979
It had two tracks and five trucks taken from MMX Racing.

268
00:15:01,979 --> 00:15:04,902
So those two people in two months,

269
00:15:04,902 --> 00:15:08,265
but a game that had better retention, better engagement,

270
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:10,306
longer sessions, and more sessions

271
00:15:10,306 --> 00:15:12,648
with players progressing further in the game

272
00:15:12,648 --> 00:15:15,150
than the 12 developers did in three years on Race Kings.

273
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,293
It's because we started down this road on Race Kings

274
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,595
and we didn't take those steps of validation

275
00:15:20,595 --> 00:15:22,937
to get closer to what players really wanted.

276
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:27,322
So while that was happening, all happening externally,

277
00:15:27,322 --> 00:15:29,122
in our London studio, we were ready to move on

278
00:15:29,122 --> 00:15:30,203
to something new.

279
00:15:30,203 --> 00:15:32,404
We split the MMX Racing team in half,

280
00:15:32,404 --> 00:15:34,984
and after a few game jams, we started on Top Drives

281
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:37,145
and MMX Hill Dash.

282
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:40,606
MMX Hill Dash, we wanted to make hill climb racing

283
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,647
with great social features.

284
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:45,428
So we had a team of five developers for five months

285
00:15:45,428 --> 00:15:46,268
and a $400,000 budget.

286
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:49,189
And to date, it's made back $12 million.

287
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:52,747
So it's back to those themes again.

288
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:54,969
Reduce risk with a small team and a short timeline

289
00:15:54,969 --> 00:15:56,471
and validate early.

290
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:57,091
Break one rule.

291
00:15:57,091 --> 00:15:59,814
So strong reference came from hill climb racing

292
00:15:59,814 --> 00:16:01,916
and we understood what risks we wanted to take

293
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,138
and where we wanted to innovate.

294
00:16:04,138 --> 00:16:05,560
And invest in your team.

295
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,502
We were really transparent about the problems

296
00:16:07,502 --> 00:16:08,503
we were having on Race Kings.

297
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:10,364
So the team was always learning.

298
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:13,698
So we were very focused on the early validation.

299
00:16:13,698 --> 00:16:16,519
So six weeks after the team came together,

300
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:19,001
we had a prototype live on the Google pizza program.

301
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:21,302
So it had three cars and five tracks.

302
00:16:21,302 --> 00:16:23,464
And what we thought when we launched

303
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:25,145
was one week's worth of content.

304
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:27,206
But it had great metrics, and it justified

305
00:16:27,206 --> 00:16:28,207
continued development.

306
00:16:28,207 --> 00:16:30,308
There were players playing every day.

307
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:31,910
for 30 to 40 days.

308
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,953
And from that, we knew where to put the value in.

309
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:38,618
So we put the value in some of the graphics to help with user acquisition.

310
00:16:38,618 --> 00:16:43,124
We could improve the economy, which improved our monetization, and we had a better Fatui

311
00:16:43,124 --> 00:16:45,326
and UX improvements, which improved our retention.

312
00:16:46,544 --> 00:16:51,708
So when you look at our revenue and downloads, you'll see the LTV to CPI ratio is the best

313
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:52,708
we've ever had to date.

314
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,349
It was scalable.

315
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:59,052
We could scale user acquisition for the first time at a major level in the company's history.

316
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:02,875
And we had this content treadmill that was really cheap, and we could keep on going for

317
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:03,455
a long time.

318
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,637
And that's facilitated it making $12 million.

319
00:17:07,105 --> 00:17:09,906
The mistake we made is we didn't appreciate it at the time.

320
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:12,287
We thought it was going to be a mash casual game,

321
00:17:12,287 --> 00:17:15,767
we weren't expecting to be able to do user acquisition.

322
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:19,288
Hill Climb Racing was justified by having 500 million downloads

323
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:23,549
and we only had about 20 million on MMX Hill Dash.

324
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:27,850
And you can see there's a big drop off after launch from in the revenue

325
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:29,051
and it was only picked up later.

326
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:31,191
So that was a missed opportunity for us

327
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:33,432
by not understanding the model of what we had at the beginning.

328
00:17:35,077 --> 00:17:38,118
At the same time, we were making Top Drives.

329
00:17:38,118 --> 00:17:41,140
So Top Drives was made at a slow pace

330
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,300
over a long period of time.

331
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,622
We wanted to move away from those shark fin revenue graphs,

332
00:17:45,622 --> 00:17:46,822
and we wanted to validate early.

333
00:17:46,822 --> 00:17:49,444
Now Top Drives, the design called for it

334
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,805
to be an always online game.

335
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:54,306
So we built the client first, and we faked all the server,

336
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:56,487
and we put it live, and we validated it.

337
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:58,008
And that prevented a wasted effort

338
00:17:58,008 --> 00:18:00,669
on an expensive server stack that we might never have needed.

339
00:18:01,857 --> 00:18:07,319
And then when you look at the Top Drives performance, Top Drives performs unlike any of the rest

340
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,500
of the titles in our portfolio.

341
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,562
It has grown since launch, with our greatest revenue days coming months after launch.

342
00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:17,704
Like Hill Dash, we've been able to scale user acquisition, but this is based off a different

343
00:18:17,704 --> 00:18:18,604
audience profile.

344
00:18:18,604 --> 00:18:23,706
It's got a smaller audience with a much longer LTV, with a low CPI, which is generating $100,000

345
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:27,108
days, and can be serviced by a team of four people.

346
00:18:28,438 --> 00:18:33,239
So again it comes back to those core themes of lean, validating early before you've made

347
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:38,040
that commitment to your product, managing your risk, creating the value for players,

348
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,181
getting closer to what players really want.

349
00:18:41,181 --> 00:18:43,162
And our team loves doing this.

350
00:18:43,162 --> 00:18:46,242
They get to work on multiple products and see how players respond and they know when

351
00:18:46,242 --> 00:18:50,283
they're working on a title, they know it's been justified because we've done that early

352
00:18:50,283 --> 00:18:51,503
validation.

353
00:18:51,503 --> 00:18:54,344
And break one rule, understand your references.

354
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:58,686
know where to innovate and what risks to take and where to be creative.

355
00:18:58,686 --> 00:19:03,729
We have this term at Hutch, it's called being hit driven and not dependent

356
00:19:03,729 --> 00:19:06,851
and we're trying to get that next 250 million dollar hit.

357
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:11,053
But as we're always lean and agile and we're always validating early,

358
00:19:11,053 --> 00:19:14,395
we can take lots of shots at goal without risking the company and we're

359
00:19:14,395 --> 00:19:17,857
focused on getting two games a year. And every title is

360
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:21,079
increasing our revenues and we're learning and stacking, allowing us to be

361
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,680
hit driven and not dependent.

362
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:26,406
And we've built that into our culture.

363
00:19:26,406 --> 00:19:28,107
So our culture is player-centric.

364
00:19:28,107 --> 00:19:30,969
Everything, the player's at the center of everything we do.

365
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:33,110
We're data-informed rather than data-driven,

366
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,092
and we're entirely transparent with our team.

367
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,433
We present everything back to them.

368
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:39,054
They get the board pack back.

369
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,835
They see all revenue, user acquisition,

370
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:43,176
and performance data.

371
00:19:43,176 --> 00:19:45,598
And our growth and insight team present back to them

372
00:19:45,598 --> 00:19:48,619
on a weekly basis on any topic they want to hear about.

373
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:51,101
They're empowered, they're autonomous,

374
00:19:51,101 --> 00:19:52,722
and trusted to make the right decisions.

375
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:55,445
And our process is lean.

376
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:58,487
Understand what compromises you have to make.

377
00:19:58,487 --> 00:20:03,150
And our business is mobile, free-to-play racing,

378
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,671
which provides this clear sense of focus

379
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,452
on what we're making.

380
00:20:07,452 --> 00:20:09,614
So we've made some fantastic mistakes,

381
00:20:09,614 --> 00:20:10,854
but we're proud of where we got to,

382
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:13,376
and these core themes have been honed organically

383
00:20:13,376 --> 00:20:15,257
through our learnings,

384
00:20:15,257 --> 00:20:17,058
and allowed us to avoid making those mistakes

385
00:20:17,058 --> 00:20:17,298
in the future.

386
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:18,339
There's a few more minutes for some questions

387
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:18,679
if anyone has any.

388
00:20:32,304 --> 00:20:36,585
Do you want to come up to the mic?

389
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:48,269
When you mentioned about the budget for all the production, is this including also user acquisition?

390
00:20:48,269 --> 00:20:53,730
And also, can you share a little bit about the channels that you use for user acquisition as well?

391
00:20:54,704 --> 00:21:01,811
No, those budgets aren't inclusive user acquisition, they're just development costs and content.

392
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:06,775
Channels for user acquisition depends what game we're talking about, it's usually Facebook.

393
00:21:06,775 --> 00:21:10,699
We work a lot with some, we have some good partnerships with some specific ad deals,

394
00:21:10,699 --> 00:21:13,341
dealerships that we've made that are bespoke to those games as well.

395
00:21:18,853 --> 00:21:21,154
Hi, I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit.

396
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:25,535
You talked about, it sounds like you put out the games super early,

397
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:26,876
maybe even before they're done.

398
00:21:26,876 --> 00:21:30,677
What does the actual process of validation look like?

399
00:21:30,677 --> 00:21:32,498
What kind of things are you looking at to determine whether or not

400
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:34,538
something's worth doing, I guess, worth finishing?

401
00:21:35,366 --> 00:21:39,007
Also, shout out to your Canadian studio, I'm from the same town.

402
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:39,547
Thank you very much.

403
00:21:39,547 --> 00:21:44,308
So the question was, what's our process to go through for early validation?

404
00:21:44,308 --> 00:21:46,168
So it's a combination of things.

405
00:21:46,168 --> 00:21:49,929
We first, we look for something that we think that we can make internally and that the team

406
00:21:49,929 --> 00:21:50,809
can really get behind.

407
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:55,350
There's a lot of, it's really easy to justify different types of genres of games, but there's

408
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,970
certain games that I don't think that Hutch would ever make very well.

409
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:02,831
I can't see us ever making, taking on Clash of Clans with that style of game.

410
00:22:03,652 --> 00:22:05,975
So it has to be something that works for us as a team.

411
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:11,102
We build it internally and it has to be something that grabs us and be fun very quickly within

412
00:22:11,102 --> 00:22:13,065
a couple of days of a game jam.

413
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:16,650
And then it has to be something that we believe we can validate early.

414
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,653
There are some games that can't be.

415
00:22:18,653 --> 00:22:18,713
So

416
00:22:20,217 --> 00:22:23,880
Once we've done that, we basically just build a profile of what is the core experience of

417
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,823
that game, what is that core loop, what are players really getting grabbed by.

418
00:22:27,823 --> 00:22:33,408
We build that in a maximum of two months, and then we use usually Google's beta program

419
00:22:33,408 --> 00:22:38,793
or early access systems, or we just soft launch it in specific territories that we know represent

420
00:22:38,793 --> 00:22:40,174
certain performance profiles.

421
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:46,016
And then we look at retention, engagement, session lengths, and that in relation to what

422
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,356
we've done.

423
00:22:46,356 --> 00:22:51,258
And because we've done this so many times now, we've got like a, we know, we've got

424
00:22:51,258 --> 00:22:55,059
benchmarks of what we know we can get at that sort of level of development.

425
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:57,860
Because obviously you can improve some of those metrics over time.

426
00:23:04,942 --> 00:23:08,003
how you act on that feedback you get from those early validations.

427
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:12,306
You talked a lot about listening to players and what they want.

428
00:23:12,306 --> 00:23:14,007
And in the experiences I have,

429
00:23:14,007 --> 00:23:17,308
that mostly amounts to removing friction from the experience

430
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:21,130
and not necessarily figuring out how the game should change.

431
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,152
How do you try and get that out of your users

432
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,613
and make those decisions to make changes or improvements to the titles?

433
00:23:28,295 --> 00:23:33,617
That's a great question. So we use a combination of qualitative and quantitative feedback.

434
00:23:33,617 --> 00:23:38,279
So there's the metrics and all the stuff that you're looking at when the game's live,

435
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:43,021
and then there's the talking to players through the Google beta process is great for getting feedback,

436
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:47,784
but we also do a lot of focus groups, user tests and stuff like that where we can physically watch people playing.

437
00:23:47,784 --> 00:23:51,325
A lot of that is great for understanding pretty small stuff.

438
00:23:51,325 --> 00:23:56,148
Quantitative feedback can give you an indication of where players are getting stuck or where they're dropping off,

439
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:57,648
but you don't really know exactly why.

440
00:23:58,513 --> 00:24:01,876
So understanding that feedback, it depends.

441
00:24:01,876 --> 00:24:04,437
A lot of it can be emotional, like this is too hard

442
00:24:04,437 --> 00:24:05,438
and I want it to be easier.

443
00:24:05,438 --> 00:24:07,299
But then when you watch their actual data,

444
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:08,540
it doesn't back that up.

445
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,861
Like a lot of players, if you look at communities,

446
00:24:10,861 --> 00:24:13,263
you'll see there's quite vibrant communities

447
00:24:13,263 --> 00:24:14,964
and we have this on top drives where some people

448
00:24:14,964 --> 00:24:17,065
will feel like this event's too hard, I don't like it,

449
00:24:17,065 --> 00:24:19,387
but then they're the ones who are winning that event

450
00:24:19,387 --> 00:24:22,649
and they're pushing really hard and they're driving it

451
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:24,790
and that's a real incentive for them.

452
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,611
So it's understanding what the true nature

453
00:24:26,611 --> 00:24:27,011
of your game should be.

454
00:24:27,468 --> 00:24:32,314
what you expected from your audience and where it's differing and then trying to gauge whether

455
00:24:32,314 --> 00:24:36,178
it's an emotional response from them or whether it's something that's tied into that commercial

456
00:24:36,178 --> 00:24:40,243
value that you can kind of move forward with. Does that make sense? Yeah.

457
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:46,312
I'm short.

458
00:24:46,312 --> 00:24:51,059
So first of all, thank you for having this as COO

459
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:52,762
and talking about failure.

460
00:24:52,762 --> 00:24:56,328
It's not often in companies or teams culture

461
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,231
to be able to say that, so huge kudos to you.

462
00:24:58,231 --> 00:24:59,053
Thank you very much.

463
00:25:00,054 --> 00:25:03,494
that speaks volumes of your true culture.

464
00:25:03,494 --> 00:25:05,375
And I guess my question to you is,

465
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:06,915
could you elaborate a little bit more

466
00:25:06,915 --> 00:25:08,635
of how do you see that playing out

467
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:10,335
within your team and organization

468
00:25:10,335 --> 00:25:13,036
to really set your team up for success

469
00:25:13,036 --> 00:25:17,037
and celebrating wins as well as what failures look like

470
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:20,057
so people are more approachable with it,

471
00:25:20,057 --> 00:25:21,858
so it's not this dark cloud

472
00:25:21,858 --> 00:25:23,898
and people would just come out front,

473
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:27,039
admit it, move on, learn from it,

474
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,179
and how do you build that safety net within your org?

475
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:31,776
That's a great question.

476
00:25:31,776 --> 00:25:36,659
So it's a lot about making, so there's no, it's about creating a sense that there's no

477
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:37,759
shame around failure.

478
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,402
The free-to-play market is incredibly brutal and the vast majority of games that go into

479
00:25:42,402 --> 00:25:43,863
it don't work.

480
00:25:43,863 --> 00:25:48,786
And we've had to be incredibly honest with our team by accepting that we're all incredibly

481
00:25:48,786 --> 00:25:50,927
fallible and we all make a lot of mistakes.

482
00:25:50,927 --> 00:25:54,629
So when we're sharing this data on a weekly basis with the team, they're understanding

483
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:57,911
what's working and what's not working so that they can be empowered to make those decisions.

484
00:25:58,852 --> 00:26:00,754
But it comes from right from the top.

485
00:26:00,754 --> 00:26:04,297
So our CEO who's sitting there with the silver mane of hair,

486
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:06,719
he makes tons of mistakes all the time.

487
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:08,520
And he won't mind me saying that.

488
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,383
It's worrying, actually, how many mistakes he makes.

489
00:26:11,383 --> 00:26:15,586
But he's incredibly open with what mistakes he makes.

490
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:17,108
And we're just very open with that.

491
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:20,551
And once you accept that, and it goes back

492
00:26:20,551 --> 00:26:23,133
to the kind of validate early, that every design is just

493
00:26:23,133 --> 00:26:24,134
an assumption.

494
00:26:24,134 --> 00:26:25,155
You're just taking a guess.

495
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:31,379
And really, I don't think there's any games designer or any studio really on the planet

496
00:26:31,379 --> 00:26:34,400
that can set out and just hit that mark of what should work and what shouldn't.

497
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,862
There are no developers here that, there's no studios in the world that haven't had multiple

498
00:26:39,862 --> 00:26:40,742
failures.

499
00:26:40,742 --> 00:26:43,623
If you look at Supercell, they kill a lot of their games.

You look at King, they've not been able to follow up with a better game than Candy Crush,

501
00:26:46,864 --> 00:26:48,164
and that's an eight year old game.

502
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:54,540
Once you accept that and you talk about failure and you just make sure that it's okay to be

503
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:59,021
a part of that and it's almost celebrated in some ways because you're learning and celebrate

504
00:26:59,021 --> 00:27:04,122
that learning, then you get a truly quite vibrant culture around it and the team can

505
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:08,484
really start learning what risks are worth taking and where they need to innovate.

506
00:27:08,484 --> 00:27:09,144
Thank you.

507
00:27:09,144 --> 00:27:09,344
Thanks.

508
00:27:09,344 --> 00:27:10,304
Any other questions?

509
00:27:18,233 --> 00:27:19,769
Brilliant. All right, well, thank you very much.
