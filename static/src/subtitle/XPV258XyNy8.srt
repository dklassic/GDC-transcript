00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,893
Hey everybody. Welcome to my talk, From Spider to Sackboy, A Big Adventure in Interactive Music.

2
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:18,038
My name is Winifred Phillips and I'm a game composer. Some of my projects include games

3
00:00:18,098 --> 00:00:25,804
from the franchises God of War, Assassin's Creed, Total War, Little Big Planet, and The Sims. I've

4
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:31,029
written about all of this in my book, A Composer's Guide to Game Music, published by the MIT Press,

5
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:34,371
and in the feature articles that I've written for Gamasutra.

6
00:00:35,472 --> 00:00:41,756
Back in the summer of 2019, I started working with Sumo Sheffield on music for two very

7
00:00:41,816 --> 00:00:42,656
different games.

8
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:48,479
It was pretty intense work, over the course of many months, on two projects with very

9
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:49,720
different musical needs.

10
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:54,583
And I spent a lot of time ping-ponging back and forth between them.

11
00:00:55,403 --> 00:01:00,886
After they both hit retail in 2020, I realized how eye-opening an experience that had been.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,464
Both games required complex musical interactivity, but each met that goal in very different ways.

13
00:01:08,404 --> 00:01:13,148
Today we're going to be taking a look at those two projects, Sackboy, a Big Adventure

14
00:01:13,188 --> 00:01:16,630
for the PlayStation 5 and Spider for Apple Arcade.

15
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:21,373
Both projects used some common dynamic implementation models.

16
00:01:21,814 --> 00:01:28,278
Over the course of this talk, we'll discuss how each project incorporated these implementation

17
00:01:28,778 --> 00:01:30,420
pure horizontal resequencing.

18
00:01:31,315 --> 00:01:39,281
pure vertical layering, a hybrid horizontal-vertical system, and a hybrid linear-dynamic structure.

19
00:01:40,743 --> 00:01:45,186
As we know, dynamic music differs from linear music in some fundamental ways.

20
00:01:45,935 --> 00:01:51,501
Linear music is a single contiguous unit, like a straight line moving in one direction with a

21
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:58,089
definitive beginning, middle, and end. But dynamic music is more like a maze that can move in many

22
00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:01,413
directions with lots of divergent possibilities.

23
00:02:01,693 --> 00:02:07,897
The art of interactive music creation and implementation is not just about understanding

24
00:02:07,937 --> 00:02:13,301
and deploying interactive music systems, such as the ones on this list. It's also about

25
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:19,465
looking at the nuts and bolts of these systems and seeing all of those divergent possibilities.

26
00:02:20,486 --> 00:02:25,069
Sackboy Big Adventure and Spider both did a great job in taking dynamic music

27
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:29,712
implementation techniques and expanding on them in creative ways. So let's explore that.

28
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:34,632
But before we jump in, I'd first like to introduce you to our two heroes.

29
00:02:35,312 --> 00:02:40,513
Of course, everyone is well acquainted with that international superstar, Sackboy.

30
00:02:41,514 --> 00:02:44,734
His daring escapades in Craftworld have become the stuff of legend.

31
00:02:45,654 --> 00:02:50,235
Sackboy's latest big adventure is a smash hit action game that pits him against the

32
00:02:50,635 --> 00:02:55,176
evil Vex, who's bent on destroying Craftworld with his terrible Topsy-Turvy machine.

33
00:02:55,756 --> 00:03:00,357
Of course, Sackboy must act fast to save the day, so let's watch him in action.

34
00:03:35,397 --> 00:03:41,339
While Sackboy is a legend, many of you may not have heard of our other hero, that amazing

35
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:47,000
covert operative, that groovy agent of mystery, that globe-trotting defender of truth and

36
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,601
freedom, Agent 8.

37
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,220
It's understandable to overlook him. He is less than an inch tall.

38
00:03:54,161 --> 00:04:00,627
The Spider Game is an Apple Arcade exclusive in which Agent 8 undertakes stealthy spy missions

39
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:05,831
to save the world many times over. Though the British spy agency would disavow any knowledge

40
00:04:05,851 --> 00:04:11,195
of his actions should he be captured or stepped on. So let's see Agent 8 in action.

41
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,242
Working on music for these two projects at the same time was an intense and rewarding experience.

42
00:04:55,823 --> 00:05:00,165
For Sackboy, A Big Adventure, I joined a diverse music team and was assigned the

43
00:05:00,205 --> 00:05:03,826
task of composing music for Sackboy's underwater escapades.

44
00:05:04,902 --> 00:05:08,943
I was also one of the team members responsible for creating cover music that would fit into

45
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:09,963
Sackboy's world.

46
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:17,245
For Spider, I was the sole composer, creating original 1960s and 70s-inspired music for

47
00:05:17,325 --> 00:05:19,165
Agent 8's sneaky spy missions.

48
00:05:19,946 --> 00:05:25,047
Both games were developed by Sumo Sheffield, and both included ambitious music systems

49
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,327
using similar dynamic strategies.

50
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:30,148
There are a lot of interesting differences, though.

51
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:33,069
And that will be the subject of our talk today.

52
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:38,737
Coming back to our list of implementation procedures, let's start with pure horizontal

53
00:05:38,777 --> 00:05:39,557
resequencing.

54
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:45,181
Both games used this technique, so we'll now focus on the most straightforward example.

55
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:51,545
Like the rest of the games in the franchise, Sackboy A Big Adventure is a celebration of

56
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:57,728
music, incorporating original compositions, licensed pop tunes, and cover tracks.

57
00:05:58,837 --> 00:06:03,781
Along with the original music tracks I composed for Sackboy Big Adventure, the team also asked

58
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:09,286
me to compose a cover song that would fit into Sackboy's world, a brand new version

59
00:06:09,506 --> 00:06:10,747
of Material Girl.

60
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:17,272
My version reimagined Material Girl as a classical orchestral composition while also retaining

61
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:20,335
enough elements to make sure it was recognizable.

62
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:25,399
The final mix was separated into segments for implementation.

63
00:06:25,995 --> 00:06:29,157
Now this is where horizontal resequencing comes in.

64
00:06:30,197 --> 00:06:34,459
When we compose music in segments that can be triggered in different orders,

65
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:40,922
that's horizontal resequencing. Shuffling things around makes the music more responsive to the

66
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:44,743
game and also it helps the music to feel a little bit less repetitive.

67
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:49,881
Material Girl is broken into segments according to its song structure, which

68
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:57,326
is actually a pretty straightforward approach. Songs typically have an intro, a verse, a chorus,

69
00:06:57,646 --> 00:07:04,451
a bridge, maybe an interlude towards the end, and an outro. Now for this interactive version

70
00:07:04,531 --> 00:07:10,356
of Material Girl, we get all of these song structure components implemented as segments

71
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,457
in a horizontal re-sequencing system.

72
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:17,370
they're all separate fragments that are activated with their own trigger points.

73
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:24,715
Now as the level starts we hear the intro segment which only plays once. This transitions right into

74
00:07:24,755 --> 00:07:29,838
the verse and chorus which is combined into one segment that's essentially the main loop.

75
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:31,399
So let's take a look at that.

76
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:42,940
**music**

77
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,609
After a while we get to the bridge. It's implemented as a short loop that triggers

78
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:20,578
right before Sackboy goes flying across a chasm. Now once he lands the music jumps

79
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:24,124
right into the interlude section. So let's see how that part worked.

80
00:08:47,983 --> 00:08:52,487
Following the interlude, we go right back to that main loop for a while, and then we

81
00:08:52,547 --> 00:08:57,811
finally get to the outro segment, which winds things up at level completion.

82
00:09:26,683 --> 00:09:29,844
You can see how the music provides a sense of reward.

83
00:09:30,345 --> 00:09:35,126
As Sackboy progresses through the level, the music advances to reveal new content.

84
00:09:35,726 --> 00:09:41,708
A dynamic music system such as this one has the primary goal of indicating progress through

85
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:42,168
the level.

86
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:48,409
In the case of Material Girl, the advantage of song structure is that it provides well-defined

87
00:09:48,509 --> 00:09:54,130
segments that are inherently dissimilar. So jumping from one segment to the next feels

88
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,431
very dramatic. We're meant to notice what's happening. It's actually part of the reward.

89
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:05,952
Now, around the same time, the developer Sumo Digital was also asking me to compose horizontally

90
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:11,833
resequenced music for the Spider Game. And that's actually a very different approach.

91
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:19,016
Spider is a pretty stealthy game. It's not about running and jumping. It's about being a secret

92
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:26,280
agent. So the music had to be sneakier. And it had to leave space for players to think and to plan.

93
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,803
For puzzle solving and exploration, the music I composed for Spider is horizontally re-sequenced,

94
00:10:33,203 --> 00:10:39,406
but those segments are designed to ebb and to flow and even to settle into silence periodically.

95
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:42,347
There are also a lot more segments involved.

96
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:48,971
Every level of the game had over 30 music segments in order to enable divergent and

97
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:53,995
unpredictable music during puzzle-solving gameplay, and the order of those segments

98
00:10:54,055 --> 00:10:57,417
is randomized so that players can't anticipate what they'll hear.

99
00:10:58,398 --> 00:11:01,259
Let's check out an example of this system in action.

100
00:11:42,851 --> 00:11:47,572
So you can see this interactive system in the Spider game isn't really indicating

101
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:51,613
progress through the level the way the Material Girl music did.

102
00:11:52,313 --> 00:11:58,175
Instead, the focus of this system in the Spider game is to create musical variety and to avoid

103
00:11:58,235 --> 00:11:59,115
predictability.

104
00:11:59,775 --> 00:12:04,216
A system like this can keep gaming music from coming across as repetitive.

105
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:08,737
So the Sackboy and Spider approaches are actually quite different.

106
00:12:09,397 --> 00:12:11,058
However, there are similarities here.

107
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:17,530
Like the material girl example from Sackboy, A Big Adventure, this system in the spider game is

108
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,973
taking an overtly segmented approach. We're aware that the music has different sections that

109
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:28,616
transition into each other and the dynamic music system structures itself around that awareness.

110
00:12:29,696 --> 00:12:34,479
But what if that isn't the goal? What if we want the horizontal resequencing system to

111
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,180
completely hide its transitions?

112
00:12:37,368 --> 00:12:42,616
Now to get a taste of how that approach would work, let's look at one of the original tracks

113
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:49,647
I composed for Sackboy A Big Adventure, Shoo-Bee Doo Hullabaloo, the boss battle music at the

114
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:51,810
end of the Thar She Blows Up level.

115
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:58,337
Now, like Material Girl, this boss battle track is structured in horizontal segments,

116
00:12:58,817 --> 00:13:02,861
in this case, three progressively more dramatic chunks of music.

117
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:09,828
But the implementation strives towards a seamless experience with the goal of hiding those transitions

118
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:10,870
rather than showing them.

119
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,711
So let's see how that worked.

120
00:13:29,064 --> 00:13:32,947
This is the end of the video.

121
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:46,456
If you enjoyed it, please subscribe and like it.

122
00:13:46,516 --> 00:13:48,477
Thank you for watching.

123
00:14:01,992 --> 00:14:07,314
As you can see, pure horizontal resequencing can be a very flexible approach to injecting

124
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:14,437
interactivity into our game music. We can aim to make our music feel seamless, or we can present

125
00:14:14,517 --> 00:14:22,120
our music in a more segmented, overt way, and both approaches can be effective. Interactive music

126
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,682
design is highly contextual. The circumstances dictate our choices.

127
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:34,514
No single method can be considered the best way or the right way. Working on these two

128
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:41,819
projects at the same time, I came across this idea over and over again. For instance, unlike Spider,

129
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:49,584
Sackboy A Big Adventure is the latest game in a franchise. And the previous games in this franchise

130
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:52,606
implemented music using pure vertical layering.

131
00:14:53,485 --> 00:15:00,789
Now when we compose our music so that our chosen instruments can be incorporated individually

132
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:06,312
and then those instruments can be divided up and manipulated separately during gameplay,

133
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:08,473
that's vertical layering.

134
00:15:09,193 --> 00:15:13,856
This technique helps music to feel reactive without also having to be divided up into

135
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:14,396
segments.

136
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:20,698
Sackboy's previous games in the franchise had an elaborate system of pure vertical layering.

137
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:26,262
For Sackboy Big Adventure, the music team favored other methods of dynamic music implementation.

138
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:30,965
However, Spider embraced pure vertical layering for its action sequences.

139
00:15:31,045 --> 00:15:33,327
So let's take a look at a couple of examples.

140
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:38,150
Our intrepid super spy, Agent 8, goes on many dangerous missions.

141
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,713
And one of them sends him scurrying through the innards of a massive computer.

142
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:49,334
The music I composed for this sequence is a funky late 60s style track with lots of

143
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:54,579
vertical layers that get activated as Agent 8 moves from one area to another.

144
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:00,544
There are no horizontal segments, so the vertical layers have to do all of the work to make

145
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,345
the music feel dynamic.

146
00:16:03,106 --> 00:16:04,107
So let's see how that worked.

147
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:58,612
In another dangerous mission, Agent 8 gets launched into outer space to rescue some imperiled

148
00:16:58,712 --> 00:16:59,332
astronauts.

149
00:16:59,772 --> 00:17:06,716
For this level, I composed an interactive 1970s space disco track with vertical layers

150
00:17:06,816 --> 00:17:08,677
that react fluidly during gameplay.

151
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:14,061
Sometimes gamers only hear the rhythmic elements of the track, sometimes they only hear the

152
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:16,542
synths, and sometimes they hear the whole mix.

153
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:22,105
The vertical layers kick in to control how intense things feel during gameplay.

154
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:25,524
So let's check that out.

155
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:20,378
This vertical layering music from Spider accomplished two goals.

156
00:18:20,998 --> 00:18:25,661
It indicated progress through the level, and it created variety to keep the music from

157
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:26,521
feeling repetitive.

158
00:18:27,201 --> 00:18:32,403
So while horizontal re-sequencing slices up a track into segments to accomplish the same

159
00:18:32,463 --> 00:18:37,826
goals, a pure vertical layering approach can instill a sense of progression and variety

160
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,907
without needing to fragment a composition.

161
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,148
But what if we want to do that anyway?

162
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:48,965
What if we want a hybrid, horizontal, vertical system with both segments and layers at the

163
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:50,446
same time in the same track?

164
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:52,728
Can we have the best of both worlds?

165
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:58,033
Well it turns out both Spyder and Sackboy Big Adventure answered that question with

166
00:18:58,053 --> 00:18:58,914
a resounding yes.

167
00:18:59,314 --> 00:19:02,177
However, each project addressed the issue differently.

168
00:19:02,277 --> 00:19:04,539
So let's start with Sackboy's approach.

169
00:19:05,428 --> 00:19:11,392
For the sync or swing level of Sackboy Big Adventure, I composed an original symphonic style waltz.

170
00:19:11,973 --> 00:19:16,856
The three-quarter time emphasized the kinetics as Sackboy swung across the level.

171
00:19:17,356 --> 00:19:23,300
Now as Sackboy progressed, the waltz of the bubbles used both horizontal segments and vertical layers

172
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:29,123
for musical interactivity. The track was broken into seven horizontal segments that progressed

173
00:19:29,443 --> 00:19:34,406
as Sackboy traversed the level. Now periodically, the elements of the overall mix

174
00:19:34,827 --> 00:19:40,735
would change to either add or subtract a women's choir as a new music layer.

175
00:19:41,256 --> 00:19:45,903
This worked to inject some much needed variety into the overall mix.

176
00:19:46,203 --> 00:19:47,665
So let's see what that was like.

177
00:20:19,948 --> 00:20:25,330
The vertical layering technique also inserted itself into the game mechanics by virtue of

178
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,151
the iconic Sackboy success melody.

179
00:20:28,871 --> 00:20:33,213
Now, those of you who have played Sackboy A Big Adventure will recognize the six notes

180
00:20:33,434 --> 00:20:34,474
in this game cinema.

181
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:38,418
Or maybe he was just guarding this odd-looking egg.

182
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,282
Here, why don't you hang on to it?

183
00:20:47,198 --> 00:20:53,180
The music team for Sackboy a Big Adventure used this success melody across the game whenever

184
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,221
Sackboy picks up a collectible known as a dreamer orb.

185
00:20:56,901 --> 00:21:03,083
We hear his success melody as a separate vertical layer that marries harmonically with whatever

186
00:21:03,223 --> 00:21:05,644
horizontal segment happens to be playing at the time.

187
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,184
So let's take a look at that.

188
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:29,461
You can see that the interactive music system here accomplishes three goals.

189
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:34,844
Goal 1, the horizontal segments indicate the player's progress through the level.

190
00:21:35,584 --> 00:21:41,167
Goal 2, vertical layers create variety to keep the music feeling fresh over time.

191
00:21:41,828 --> 00:21:47,211
Goal 3, an additional vertical layer provides a reward when objectives are achieved.

192
00:21:48,051 --> 00:21:51,913
So we can see that horizontal and vertical techniques work well together.

193
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:57,117
They worked for both Sackboy, A Big Adventure, and for The Spider Game, which I was working

194
00:21:57,238 --> 00:21:58,339
on at the same time.

195
00:21:59,341 --> 00:22:02,826
The implementation for Spider, though, is very different structurally.

196
00:22:03,608 --> 00:22:10,073
For example, during one of Spider's more stealthy levels, Agent 8 infiltrates the enemy's

197
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:11,414
high-security war room.

198
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:16,958
While pursuing his mission to obtain some top-secret documents, Agent 8 accidentally

199
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:23,302
turns on a desk radio, and my 60s-style lounge jazz music composition starts playing from

200
00:22:23,362 --> 00:22:23,423
it.

201
00:22:23,863 --> 00:22:26,305
This keeps playing throughout the rest of the mission.

202
00:22:38,576 --> 00:22:43,621
Diagetic music, like my lounge jazz composition from the War Room Radio, is considered to

203
00:22:43,681 --> 00:22:50,247
exist inside the fictional narrative, whereas non-diagetic music, or dramatic underscore,

204
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,529
is considered to be outside of it.

205
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:57,514
So now that we have that continuous diagetic jazz music from the radio, does this mean

206
00:22:57,574 --> 00:23:00,056
that we can no longer have dramatic underscore?

207
00:23:01,137 --> 00:23:07,780
Not at all. We just have to apply some creative solutions. The audio team at Sumo Sheffield and I

208
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:13,783
solved this problem with a hybrid dynamic music system that included both horizontal segments

209
00:23:14,003 --> 00:23:20,145
and vertical layers. Now, first, a vertical layer would start playing that continuous jazz music

210
00:23:20,205 --> 00:23:21,206
from the War Room Radio.

211
00:23:21,746 --> 00:23:27,895
and then the dramatic underscore would come in on top delivered in over 30 horizontal segments.

212
00:23:28,336 --> 00:23:32,962
Now like the success melody from sock boy these music segments were structured

213
00:23:33,303 --> 00:23:36,387
to blend with the other music that was already playing.

214
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:42,031
so every measure of the radio music would have a corresponding measure of dramatic underscore.

215
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:45,693
These underscore segments would only play when they were triggered,

216
00:23:46,414 --> 00:23:48,815
so they'd usually play in different sequences.

217
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:52,837
This helped the music to stay fresh as gameplay progressed.

218
00:23:53,518 --> 00:23:54,638
Let's check out what that was like.

219
00:24:21,743 --> 00:24:26,726
As we can see, this interactive music system from the Spider War Room actually accomplishes

220
00:24:26,826 --> 00:24:27,546
many goals.

221
00:24:28,126 --> 00:24:33,349
The horizontal segments indicate progress through the level, they create musical variety,

222
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:36,691
and they reward players when objectives are achieved.

223
00:24:37,332 --> 00:24:42,435
Plus, the vertical layers allow us to merge diegetic and non-diegetic music together.

224
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:48,158
But there is another goal that dynamic implementation can address, and it's actually a much more

225
00:24:48,218 --> 00:24:50,219
practical consideration than any of the others.

226
00:24:50,973 --> 00:24:57,657
Dynamic music can stretch one piece of music so that it's doing the jobs typically done by several tracks.

227
00:24:58,278 --> 00:25:06,222
Dynamic systems can make one piece of music take the place of an ambient track, a puzzle-solving track, and a high-energy action track.

228
00:25:06,262 --> 00:25:11,205
It's actually a great way for development teams to optimize music coverage for their games.

229
00:25:11,946 --> 00:25:13,747
So let's see a couple of examples of this.

230
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:19,093
Earlier we checked out the Shoo-Bee-Doo Hullabaloo music from Sackboy Big Adventure.

231
00:25:19,713 --> 00:25:23,775
While we already looked at that big boss fight music from the end of the level,

232
00:25:24,075 --> 00:25:30,438
that same music also starts the level in a very low-keyed way. It's pretty understated and calm.

233
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:38,362
And that same musical composition slowly builds in intensity by virtue of its horizontal segments.

234
00:25:38,802 --> 00:25:43,746
So, by the time we get to the end of the level, it's gone from a peaceful ambient texture

235
00:25:44,187 --> 00:25:46,369
all the way to a rousing orchestral finale.

236
00:25:46,989 --> 00:25:49,011
Let's check out how that transformation occurred.

237
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:33,217
In this excerpt from Sackboy, A Big Adventure, we saw how a dynamic music system enabled

238
00:26:33,377 --> 00:26:39,322
a single piece of music to scale between broadly divergent levels of dramatic intensity.

239
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:45,637
But the Spider video game takes this idea even further by employing one of the more

240
00:26:45,758 --> 00:26:52,126
interesting and unusual applications of dynamic implementation for its timed micromission

241
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:52,687
challenges.

242
00:26:53,408 --> 00:26:55,131
So let's discuss how that system worked.

243
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:01,783
We all know that purely linear music has some distinct advantages. As we mentioned at the

244
00:27:01,823 --> 00:27:08,386
beginning of this talk, linear music has a set beginning, middle, and end. Linear music can more

245
00:27:08,486 --> 00:27:15,610
fully explore its ideas without having to worry about how the maze of a dynamic music system might

246
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:18,351
impact an instrumental arrangement or

247
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:24,257
juggle the progression of musical content, or even truncate melodic lines.

248
00:27:24,698 --> 00:27:27,561
Now, while all these issues are solvable,

249
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:31,445
linear music certainly provides an added breath of creative freedom.

250
00:27:32,626 --> 00:27:36,050
So, is it possible to preserve these advantages

251
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,294
while also employing dynamic implementation in our tracks?

252
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,461
Well, let's see how the Spider game tackled that challenge.

253
00:27:44,082 --> 00:27:50,406
When Agent 8 isn't off saving the world, he's back at headquarters where he's evaluated,

254
00:27:50,506 --> 00:27:52,948
and he undertakes difficult training missions.

255
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,829
These missions are timed sequences.

256
00:27:54,889 --> 00:27:56,830
They last exactly 3 minutes.

257
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,094
Now because of this, when composing music for these timed training missions, I was able

258
00:28:02,154 --> 00:28:08,057
to work in a hybrid music structure that combined both linear and dynamic elements.

259
00:28:08,718 --> 00:28:14,523
I composed a piece of linear music that lasted exactly 3 minutes with a definitive beginning,

260
00:28:14,803 --> 00:28:15,624
middle, and end.

261
00:28:16,264 --> 00:28:21,469
And then I added vertical layers to this linear composition so that allowed it to scale in

262
00:28:21,529 --> 00:28:24,331
intensity as the countdown sequence progressed.

263
00:28:24,671 --> 00:28:26,893
So let's take a look at how that worked.

264
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:33,338
Notice how this hybrid linear dynamic structure adds layers when mission objectives are met.

265
00:28:38,748 --> 00:28:41,069
the game.

266
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:20,657
So now we've discussed four distinct forms of dynamic music implementation.

267
00:29:21,257 --> 00:29:26,279
We've reviewed the structural mechanics of both horizontal re-sequencing and

268
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:27,199
vertical layering.

269
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:32,681
And we've taken a look at how these very different interactive techniques can be

270
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:34,542
merged into hybrid forms.

271
00:29:35,342 --> 00:29:39,183
We've also examined some of the goals of dynamic music implementation.

272
00:29:40,063 --> 00:29:45,184
By working with Sumo Digital on both Sackboy, A Big Adventure and Spider at the same time,

273
00:29:45,204 --> 00:29:49,045
I had the chance to see how versatile dynamic music can be.

274
00:29:49,825 --> 00:29:54,586
As we discussed earlier, interactive music design is highly contextual.

275
00:29:54,806 --> 00:29:59,567
The circumstances dictate our choices. There is no best way or right way.

276
00:30:00,307 --> 00:30:03,808
By keeping an open mind and exploring our options,

277
00:30:03,888 --> 00:30:08,749
we have the opportunity to discover lots of divergent possibilities.

278
00:30:09,773 --> 00:30:13,637
It's one of the more inspiring aspects of our work as game composers.

279
00:30:14,778 --> 00:30:16,340
Thanks very much for watching.
