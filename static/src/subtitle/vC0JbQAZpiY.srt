1
00:00:06,903 --> 00:00:10,045
All right, so let's go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:10,045 --> 00:00:13,947
So, hi, my name is Lauren Kason,

3
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:17,469
and I am a senior artist at S2 Games,

4
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:19,810
where we recently shipped Monument Valley 2.

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,172
I've been working in the industry for about six years.

6
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:25,773
Here I am at the end of art school,

7
00:00:25,773 --> 00:00:28,554
I think days before I got offered my first internship,

8
00:00:28,554 --> 00:00:29,995
and here I am last year.

9
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:32,196
I've been changing my hair pretty regularly,

10
00:00:32,196 --> 00:00:33,997
but obviously some things never change.

11
00:00:35,354 --> 00:00:39,677
And my career, I'm sure like many of yours,

12
00:00:39,677 --> 00:00:42,859
has been really all over the place.

13
00:00:42,859 --> 00:00:46,722
I got my start working in AAA and free to play.

14
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:50,485
So I was on really, really big teams

15
00:00:50,485 --> 00:00:51,886
with a lot of structure.

16
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,287
My first job was actually 38.

17
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:54,368
Are there any 38ers in the room?

18
00:00:54,368 --> 00:00:55,488
Anybody remember that?

19
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:56,429
Yeah, hey, yeah.

20
00:00:57,797 --> 00:01:03,101
And as a young junior artist at these bigger studios,

21
00:01:03,101 --> 00:01:04,062
the problems that I had to solve

22
00:01:04,062 --> 00:01:06,884
were always really well defined for me by someone else.

23
00:01:06,884 --> 00:01:13,109
So draw a cute giraffe, or render these materials,

24
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:15,911
or make a really cool helicopter.

25
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:20,483
But about three years ago, I went from mostly working

26
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:23,227
on really, really big teams, where my role was really

27
00:01:23,227 --> 00:01:26,511
well-defined, and I was always tasked by somebody else,

28
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:29,736
to much smaller teams on games like Luna,

29
00:01:29,736 --> 00:01:33,581
Where the Water Tastes Like Wine, and Monument Valley 2.

30
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:36,400
which I was really excited about.

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,962
My heart really lies with these sorts of experimental,

32
00:01:39,962 --> 00:01:42,884
emotional games, and honestly I felt so lucky

33
00:01:42,884 --> 00:01:45,886
that these smaller studios took a chance on me.

34
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:48,867
But I really wasn't prepared for how,

35
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:52,350
though my ability to make things and render

36
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,351
and having the craft of being a game artist

37
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:57,032
was really important, a large part of my job

38
00:01:57,032 --> 00:02:00,635
was gonna be so different from the kind of problem solving

39
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:01,235
that I was used to.

40
00:02:02,794 --> 00:02:05,757
It was stuff like, how do you make a VR hand

41
00:02:05,757 --> 00:02:07,858
that doesn't make people want to hit?

42
00:02:07,858 --> 00:02:11,782
Or what should that be?

43
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:12,222
Honestly, I sucked.

44
00:02:12,222 --> 00:02:16,686
I sucked at answering these questions at the beginning.

45
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:19,048
There's that word concept artist

46
00:02:19,048 --> 00:02:21,250
and concepts and problem solving

47
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:23,512
had just become a much bigger part of my job title

48
00:02:23,512 --> 00:02:25,474
and I was finding it super hard.

49
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:29,512
I found myself doing stuff like throwing pages and pages

50
00:02:29,512 --> 00:02:32,994
of color keys at problems that probably needed

51
00:02:32,994 --> 00:02:35,355
a really different approach.

52
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:38,917
Or just iterating as fast as I could on stuff

53
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:41,258
without thinking about why I was iterating

54
00:02:41,258 --> 00:02:43,639
on that particular idea in the first place.

55
00:02:44,428 --> 00:02:47,150
And I think for a lot of us, this

56
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,691
is a really emotionally difficult thing

57
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:51,773
to admit that you're having trouble with.

58
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:53,894
I know that I found it much easier

59
00:02:53,894 --> 00:02:56,196
to say to my art director, hey, you

60
00:02:56,196 --> 00:02:58,337
know, I don't know how to bake this kind of light map

61
00:02:58,337 --> 00:03:03,640
than, hey, I'm having a really hard time coming up with ideas,

62
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,642
and I don't feel like I have strategies for it.

63
00:03:06,473 --> 00:03:09,213
I think we look at this kind of creativity

64
00:03:09,213 --> 00:03:11,154
as something that's innate to people

65
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:14,675
and not something that can be learned or improved on,

66
00:03:14,675 --> 00:03:16,595
that people are just born with it.

67
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:21,236
But that's a false narrative that I think I've heard before,

68
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:23,196
that artists are born with talent.

69
00:03:23,196 --> 00:03:25,497
And I think most artists in this room

70
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:27,857
will tell you that that is not really true.

71
00:03:27,857 --> 00:03:29,658
Talent is kind of a myth.

72
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:32,338
Artists are good artists because they practiced.

73
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:33,759
It's your love of a thing,

74
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,219
and it is the hours that you have put in.

75
00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:40,075
So this roach was actually one of my first portfolio pieces

76
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:41,736
that I submitted to studios.

77
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:43,537
And this was definitely the best thing in there.

78
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:44,738
There was a lot worse.

79
00:03:44,738 --> 00:03:47,460
And I unfortunately couldn't find the rest of it.

80
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,341
But I was not that good.

81
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:50,643
People would not have said that I was talented.

82
00:03:50,643 --> 00:03:52,464
In fact, art directors specifically

83
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:54,746
told me that I wasn't when I went to portfolio reviews.

84
00:03:56,127 --> 00:03:57,609
But I put in the hours and I got better.

85
00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:00,612
And I'm pretty sure that this whole creative thinking,

86
00:04:00,612 --> 00:04:03,896
inspiration stuff is probably pretty similar.

87
00:04:03,896 --> 00:04:05,518
That we have a broken narrative

88
00:04:05,518 --> 00:04:07,621
and it's something you can get better at.

89
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:09,823
It's just a question of where you put that time.

90
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:12,706
And that's what this talk is gonna be about.

91
00:04:12,706 --> 00:04:16,027
It's where can you put that time to improve

92
00:04:16,027 --> 00:04:18,848
at this pretty nebulous concept.

93
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:21,730
I'm definitely still figuring this stuff out.

94
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,430
I don't have all the answers.

95
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,851
But I'm gonna share with you some processes

96
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:26,472
that I have found really useful

97
00:04:26,472 --> 00:04:29,193
and some things that I incorporate into my daily routine

98
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:32,915
that have really helped me with expanding my own creativity.

99
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:33,795
And at the end of the talk,

100
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:34,676
I'll actually walk you through

101
00:04:34,676 --> 00:04:36,857
how we built a Monument Valley 2 level

102
00:04:36,857 --> 00:04:39,438
and how we incorporated a lot of these processes into that.

103
00:04:41,132 --> 00:04:44,053
And a caveat, as far as inspiration goes,

104
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:46,455
I am not here to tell you one cool trick

105
00:04:46,455 --> 00:04:48,776
to pull out of your hat

106
00:04:48,776 --> 00:04:50,836
during difficult brainstorming sessions.

107
00:04:50,836 --> 00:04:52,657
This isn't about cool tricks.

108
00:04:52,657 --> 00:04:54,298
Game devs don't hate me.

109
00:04:54,298 --> 00:04:56,019
Maybe my ex, but that's a different story.

110
00:04:56,019 --> 00:05:01,301
The things I wanna talk about are less one cool trick,

111
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,462
they're more like going to the gym or keeping a sketchbook.

112
00:05:04,462 --> 00:05:07,044
It's stuff that you make a habit of.

113
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:09,144
And if you can integrate it into your routines,

114
00:05:09,144 --> 00:05:11,025
you will see change and you will see improvement.

115
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,233
So the first thing that I want to talk about

116
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:17,255
is something called Open Mode.

117
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:21,377
It comes from this talk that John Cleese of Monty Python

118
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:23,999
gave called How to Be Creative.

119
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:25,480
It's pretty easy to find.

120
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,381
Just Google John Cleese Creativity Talk.

121
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:29,423
Now, I'm slightly remiss to recommend it,

122
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:32,065
because he makes some pretty questionable jokes

123
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:34,866
about women's liberation in Eastern Europeans.

124
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:36,628
But it's an old talk, and we're going

125
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,069
to pull some of the good nuggets out,

126
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:39,970
because I think the way he verbalizes this idea

127
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,610
is really, really good.

128
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:45,279
So he talks about us having two sorts of creative modes.

129
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,300
You've got open mode and you have closed mode.

130
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,500
So closed mode is the sort of getting stuff done mode.

131
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,821
It's emails, it's blasting through your Jira tickets,

132
00:05:56,821 --> 00:05:58,322
it's putting on your headphones

133
00:05:58,322 --> 00:06:01,462
and doing some really, really careful rendering all day.

134
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,503
And I think a lot of us are the most comfortable

135
00:06:03,503 --> 00:06:04,803
in closed mode.

136
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:06,163
I know that I certainly was.

137
00:06:06,163 --> 00:06:09,004
This, I was realizing, was probably

138
00:06:09,004 --> 00:06:10,724
where I had spent most of my artistic career.

139
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,254
And then there's open mode.

140
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:17,537
Open mode is the more quote-unquote creative mode.

141
00:06:17,537 --> 00:06:20,980
It's more contemplative, it's more inclined to humor,

142
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,242
it's more playful, and this is the space

143
00:06:23,242 --> 00:06:24,643
where a lot of our best ideas come from.

144
00:06:24,643 --> 00:06:27,525
It's where a lot of our problem solving happens,

145
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:29,087
and it's where we find a lot of our inspiration.

146
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:30,748
So I saw this talk and I was like, okay, great.

147
00:06:30,748 --> 00:06:32,449
I just need to do what the money Python guy says

148
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:34,691
and get myself in open mode.

149
00:06:34,691 --> 00:06:39,135
So you see that time tide, you go to a quiet room,

150
00:06:39,135 --> 00:06:40,916
you get your sketchbook.

151
00:06:41,572 --> 00:06:43,233
And I was like, cool, open mode, gonna do it.

152
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:46,534
But you sit down, and you're like,

153
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:49,095
oh yeah, you know what, I have those emails

154
00:06:49,095 --> 00:06:50,396
that I need to reply to.

155
00:06:50,396 --> 00:06:51,316
I forgot to check that file in.

156
00:06:51,316 --> 00:06:53,778
I should probably do that.

157
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:56,339
What about that thing that Stacy said this morning?

158
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:57,579
That was really weird.

159
00:06:57,579 --> 00:07:00,320
I'm just gonna check Twitter really quick.

160
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,162
Ah, no, I'm supposed to be in open mode right now.

161
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:04,702
Ah, I don't know what I'm doing.

162
00:07:04,702 --> 00:07:06,683
This is useless, I'm useless.

163
00:07:06,683 --> 00:07:10,045
So, if that train of thought sounds familiar to any of you,

164
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,924
Then the first strategy that I'm actually going to recommend is mindfulness.

165
00:07:15,924 --> 00:07:19,449
I'm not saying that you should be doing it while you're trying to come up with ideas,

166
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:23,714
but I find that having a daily practice with this really helps me because it trains some

167
00:07:23,714 --> 00:07:29,401
pretty specific things that make it much easier to stay in that open, creative, useful space.

168
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,098
But what actually is mindfulness?

169
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:33,899
I feel like I've been hearing it a lot of talks,

170
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:35,901
but nobody's quite explained it.

171
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:37,863
It's a big concept, but in short,

172
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:40,025
it's kind of a simple form of meditation.

173
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:42,888
It involves stuff like focusing on your breath

174
00:07:42,888 --> 00:07:43,849
and body awareness.

175
00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:44,589
I personally use Headspace,

176
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,253
but there's a lot of other cool apps and books

177
00:07:48,253 --> 00:07:49,854
and stuff out there,

178
00:07:49,854 --> 00:07:53,438
and it's helped me in some pretty specific ways.

179
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:59,146
So the first is I found it helps with bringing your mind back

180
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,367
to the problem at hand.

181
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:04,892
When you are blue sky thinking, it's so easy to get off topic

182
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:06,533
or to forget what you were supposed

183
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:08,355
to be doing in the first place.

184
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,177
And it helps train that focus.

185
00:08:10,177 --> 00:08:13,821
But more importantly, it helps stop that voice in your head

186
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:16,363
that gets mad at you for getting distracted in the first place.

187
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:22,105
The second is, honestly, it can be really boring.

188
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:24,307
But there's a lot of studies that show that boredom

189
00:08:24,307 --> 00:08:25,928
is actually really, really good for creativity.

190
00:08:25,928 --> 00:08:29,451
And getting more comfortable with being bored

191
00:08:29,451 --> 00:08:30,512
can be really helpful.

192
00:08:32,157 --> 00:08:35,818
and learning to sit with discomfort and anxiety.

193
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:37,519
Now, I don't necessarily mean about your life,

194
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,039
so that's great too.

195
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,780
I mean more that this open mode

196
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,500
is more uncomfortable than closed.

197
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,641
It feels better to go with the first idea that you have

198
00:08:46,641 --> 00:08:48,802
and to start drilling in

199
00:08:48,802 --> 00:08:53,243
rather than staying in that space of, I don't know,

200
00:08:53,243 --> 00:08:53,983
and I'm thinking about it.

201
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:57,074
But often your best ideas are not your first ones.

202
00:08:57,074 --> 00:08:59,037
They're the ones that you get to

203
00:08:59,037 --> 00:09:00,400
when you've been letting your mind

204
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,562
sit up against that discomfort.

205
00:09:01,562 --> 00:09:04,327
And if you can't stay in that uncomfortable space,

206
00:09:04,327 --> 00:09:05,228
you're not gonna get to them.

207
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:09,589
So on a sort of similar note, I would really recommend

208
00:09:09,589 --> 00:09:11,350
getting off the internet on days that you know

209
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,371
you're gonna be solving these sorts of difficult problems.

210
00:09:13,371 --> 00:09:15,913
Maybe some of you have a healthier relationship

211
00:09:15,913 --> 00:09:17,954
to social media than I do, but I know that the first thing

212
00:09:17,954 --> 00:09:20,935
that I do when I'm uncomfortable or I am unsure

213
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,857
is I tend to grab for Facebook or social media

214
00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:23,817
or Reddit or whatever.

215
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:27,219
It's become a mental security blanket for a lot of us.

216
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:28,780
And I find that the sort of scrolling

217
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,841
really, really hinders me.

218
00:09:29,841 --> 00:09:31,782
I think, going back to a previous point,

219
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:34,904
because it means I never really have to be bored,

220
00:09:34,904 --> 00:09:36,345
never really have to be uncomfortable.

221
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:40,271
So I personally use an app called Zero Willpower.

222
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:44,355
It blocks a list of websites and apps on my phone for myself.

223
00:09:44,355 --> 00:09:46,256
And a browser extension called Stay Focus.

224
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:49,379
So I know that, hey, if today is a brainstorming day at work,

225
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:50,420
before I get there in the morning,

226
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,322
I hit the button on both of these apps.

227
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:54,323
So I cannot be scrolling Twitter, not even

228
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:57,426
in the bathroom, because, hey, maybe sitting on the toilet

229
00:09:57,426 --> 00:09:58,767
is when you would have been making those.

230
00:10:02,462 --> 00:10:07,105
So that's the first strategy then, is mindfulness and getting off the internet.

231
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:09,527
What is the next thing that you might want to work on?

232
00:10:09,527 --> 00:10:10,748
Randomness.

233
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:15,932
So, working on your ability to come up with random things, to follow seemingly stupid

234
00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:22,477
lines of thought and make irrelevant connections and leaps will really greatly serve you, especially

235
00:10:22,477 --> 00:10:24,779
when it comes to things like brainstorming and mind mapping.

236
00:10:26,367 --> 00:10:31,970
Introducing an element of randomness has been serving humanity for a very long time.

237
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,353
And my personal favorite examples are usually from divination, particularly something called

238
00:10:37,353 --> 00:10:38,594
scapulomancy.

239
00:10:38,594 --> 00:10:44,017
So in a few cultures around the world, particularly in a few ancient communities in North America,

240
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:47,607
People used to take a scapula before going on a hunt,

241
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:48,887
and they would burn it.

242
00:10:48,887 --> 00:10:52,329
And then they would use the cracks in that scapula

243
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:54,690
that formed from the heat as a map of the area.

244
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,351
And they would follow the lines to figure out

245
00:10:57,351 --> 00:10:58,852
where they were going to go hunt that day.

246
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:04,134
So, Scapulomancy was a great early random number generator

247
00:11:04,134 --> 00:11:06,035
that meant people didn't end up going hunting

248
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:07,316
in the same area all the time.

249
00:11:07,316 --> 00:11:08,637
It mixed things up,

250
00:11:08,637 --> 00:11:12,318
and it helped make sure that they struck out into new areas.

251
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,828
And introducing your own kinds of randomness

252
00:11:14,828 --> 00:11:17,929
into your process, and even ritual,

253
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:19,910
can really help you strike out into new areas.

254
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,492
So to provide a couple more divination examples,

255
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:25,073
because I think they're really fun,

256
00:11:25,073 --> 00:11:26,994
an old one is Bible dipping.

257
00:11:26,994 --> 00:11:28,795
I grew up in the Bible Belt of Texas,

258
00:11:28,795 --> 00:11:30,616
so we used to do this as kids.

259
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:32,917
But you can do it with books of poetry,

260
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:35,599
or Sandman comics, or whatever you want.

261
00:11:35,599 --> 00:11:37,020
So you open a book to a random page,

262
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,900
and you point at a line.

263
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,082
How does that apply to your current problem?

264
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:41,662
Point at another.

265
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:42,563
How do you model to?

266
00:11:43,188 --> 00:11:44,809
What game could that be?

267
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:47,930
Another personal favorite here is Tarot.

268
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,050
I've been reading Tarot for about five years,

269
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,911
and it is my absolute favorite two-player branching narrative game

270
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:55,332
that gives me my best ideas.

271
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:56,552
Pull three cards.

272
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:59,173
What story do those three things tell?

273
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:00,473
Put them in a different order.

274
00:12:00,473 --> 00:12:01,294
What does it tell now?

275
00:12:01,294 --> 00:12:07,215
So, if this all seems a little bit witchy and woo-woo to all of you,

276
00:12:07,215 --> 00:12:09,016
and maybe a little bit irrelevant,

277
00:12:10,422 --> 00:12:12,563
We kind of already do this.

278
00:12:12,563 --> 00:12:14,765
I know that a lot of us have turned to Jesse Schell's deck

279
00:12:14,765 --> 00:12:16,827
of lenses to get ideas brewing.

280
00:12:16,827 --> 00:12:19,289
And it's a lot of the same principles.

281
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:20,851
So much of this pulls from divination.

282
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:23,333
And if you want some really wonderful rituals

283
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,194
for introducing randomness into your process,

284
00:12:25,194 --> 00:12:28,537
I would really highly recommend doing some research

285
00:12:28,537 --> 00:12:29,238
on divination methods.

286
00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:32,441
My co-worker Joel, this is Joel.

287
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:36,237
took some similar approaches in the early stages

288
00:12:36,237 --> 00:12:39,119
of Monument Valley 2, but with podcasts instead of cards.

289
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:41,941
So Joel is a game designer, and he had to come up

290
00:12:41,941 --> 00:12:44,383
with a ton of puzzles per week.

291
00:12:44,383 --> 00:12:47,045
So every time that there was a 99% invisible episode

292
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:48,967
that would come out, he would try to come up

293
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:51,188
with a Monument Valley puzzle that was based

294
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,029
on that subject matter.

295
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:54,551
So you can do this with really anything you know,

296
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:55,332
whatever works for you.

297
00:12:55,332 --> 00:12:57,533
If it's cloud shapes, if it's bird flight patterns,

298
00:12:57,533 --> 00:12:59,054
if it's podcasts, if it's the thing

299
00:12:59,054 --> 00:13:01,636
that reached the top of Reddit, whatever works.

300
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:06,318
There's another really easy and fun way to get started

301
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:08,919
being better at being random,

302
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,980
is a Japanese word game called Shiratori.

303
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,983
So you say a word, you take the last letter of that word,

304
00:13:14,983 --> 00:13:17,064
and you come up with a word that starts with it,

305
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:17,504
and so on and so on.

306
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:20,286
So for example, you could have cat ends with T,

307
00:13:20,286 --> 00:13:22,247
toe ends with E, escalator.

308
00:13:22,247 --> 00:13:23,768
What would that game be?

309
00:13:23,768 --> 00:13:25,289
Or lipstick, kibble, elephant.

310
00:13:32,988 --> 00:13:36,631
Another favorite of mine is Wikipedia's random page generator.

311
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:40,213
So this landed me on a page about a Welshman in the 50s

312
00:13:40,213 --> 00:13:43,155
who lived in Sweden but was a karate master,

313
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,797
which sounds like a pretty cool game to me.

314
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:48,799
Or maybe you land on a page about kinetic energy.

315
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:51,381
How can you apply that to the problem that you're trying to solve?

316
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:55,024
And when you're playing these games,

317
00:13:55,024 --> 00:13:57,626
understand that a lot of it is going to be a strikeout.

318
00:13:58,713 --> 00:13:59,893
That's okay.

319
00:13:59,893 --> 00:14:02,854
There is probably nothing to cat-toe escalators.

320
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:07,115
Maybe kinetic energy is not gonna be the answer this time.

321
00:14:07,115 --> 00:14:10,076
But playing with these concepts is gonna do a lot

322
00:14:10,076 --> 00:14:12,757
to expand your thinking and your methods of problem solving.

323
00:14:12,757 --> 00:14:13,197
And speaking of play,

324
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:17,878
a lot of what I've been describing is play,

325
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:19,479
which is great.

326
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:19,999
Games are play.

327
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:22,119
I think we like play.

328
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:24,120
And play is a really good mindset to be in

329
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,420
when you're trying to find inspiration.

330
00:14:26,502 --> 00:14:29,244
Play is in that open space that we talked about earlier.

331
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:33,527
And if I'm getting frustrated, a lot of times I will play some rounds of

332
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:36,609
territory. I'll play with my tarot cards. It puts

333
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:40,071
you in a much better mind space than blowing off steam on Facebook

334
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:42,173
or trying to force yourself to have a cool idea.

335
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:47,317
And also speaking of play, play is often best

336
00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:51,360
when you invite others, but only if you play nice.

337
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:58,567
The people that you invite in make you feel defensive or unsafe.

338
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:01,709
It shuts down that creative process.

339
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:03,991
There's a lot of research that supports this.

340
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:07,794
Google had that really cool study about psychological safety that I'm sure a lot of you saw.

341
00:15:07,794 --> 00:15:14,279
You also want to do what you can to be somebody who also plays nice, who is supportive, and

342
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,140
who keeps other people safe.

343
00:15:17,013 --> 00:15:20,074
And if that's something that you want to get better at,

344
00:15:20,074 --> 00:15:22,174
I would recommend trying improv.

345
00:15:22,174 --> 00:15:23,554
Now, I don't personally do improv,

346
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:25,235
but I do something that stretches

347
00:15:25,235 --> 00:15:27,415
a lot of the same muscles and has similarly

348
00:15:27,415 --> 00:15:31,576
devout followers, which is partner dancing.

349
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:33,937
So both of these things help you with building

350
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:37,137
on other people's ideas, going with the flow,

351
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:39,278
reacting in the moment, all of which

352
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:40,818
is going to make you a better teammate and a better

353
00:15:40,818 --> 00:15:43,379
brainstorming partner and probably overall cool human.

354
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:43,459
Now.

355
00:15:45,481 --> 00:15:51,105
from improv that I want to talk about, and that's yes and.

356
00:15:51,105 --> 00:15:54,708
The general idea being if somebody says something to you,

357
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,729
you cannot say no during the sketch.

358
00:15:56,729 --> 00:15:59,451
You have to say yes, and it was a cat,

359
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:00,492
or something like that.

360
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,354
This is a really, really, really great thing

361
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:06,557
to bring with you when you are working on ideation.

362
00:16:06,557 --> 00:16:09,419
It really helps keep people engaged,

363
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:11,501
it helps promote safety, and it helps keep things moving.

364
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:14,383
So the last strategy I have got for you.

365
00:16:18,054 --> 00:16:19,875
So what exactly does that mean?

366
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:24,956
A good way of breaking it down would be, say,

367
00:16:24,956 --> 00:16:28,617
taking the puzzle, or the level, or the problem,

368
00:16:28,617 --> 00:16:30,638
or the behavior that you're stuck on,

369
00:16:30,638 --> 00:16:33,879
and describe it as if you were telling someone

370
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:34,799
about it over the phone.

371
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,020
Someone who had never seen it before.

372
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:40,787
This is actually a strategy that I learned from a mentor of mine, Jeff Hesser,

373
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:43,469
back when I was in university.

374
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,051
He's given some really, really good GDC talks

375
00:16:46,051 --> 00:16:48,313
where he goes way more into depth on this,

376
00:16:48,313 --> 00:16:52,376
so I would highly recommend checking those out.

377
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:54,618
So let's look at an example with a Rubik's Cube.

378
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:56,819
How would we describe a Rubik's Cube?

379
00:16:56,819 --> 00:16:58,000
We can say it's a cube.

380
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:02,538
It's made of black plastic.

381
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:03,838
It's got 26 smaller cubes.

382
00:17:03,838 --> 00:17:10,662
Each side of the cube has 26 faces, or yeah, nine faces.

383
00:17:10,662 --> 00:17:14,284
They can be white, green, yellow, red, or blue.

384
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:17,246
You can twist it along certain axis's.

385
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:20,067
It's about four by four inches.

386
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:25,690
It makes a clicky sound when you play with it.

387
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,631
So what's the point of this exercise?

388
00:17:27,662 --> 00:17:30,984
If you're stuck, if you're trying to design around a problem with a Rubik's Cube,

389
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:33,746
you've already been looking at it for a while.

390
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:36,988
You probably know intuitively that this thing is made of black plastic.

391
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:44,192
So, I find it really helps you find the details and things that you didn't see before.

392
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:48,354
Things that maybe you've already spent a lot of time looking at.

393
00:17:48,354 --> 00:17:52,857
I've often been surprised by how much about a puzzle or a problem I didn't notice

394
00:17:52,857 --> 00:17:57,040
before going through this process of verbalizing a description to myself.

395
00:17:57,969 --> 00:18:01,290
It really helps you find those pieces of information

396
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,932
that might have seemed irrelevant,

397
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:06,913
but are often really key to the problem at hand.

398
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:08,794
And this list can be helpful in a lot of different ways.

399
00:18:08,794 --> 00:18:11,756
So let's look at how we use this method on Moneo Valley 2.

400
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:15,178
So I'm actually going to take you through the whole process

401
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,299
of creating art for this particular level

402
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:20,081
from start to finish, and you'll see a lot of the principles

403
00:18:20,081 --> 00:18:21,141
that I talked about at play.

404
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,723
So the process for level design was

405
00:18:24,723 --> 00:18:27,065
we would get a puzzle from a designer,

406
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,861
then the artist would have to figure out what it looked like.

407
00:18:29,861 --> 00:18:32,561
With the art direction, at least at the beginning,

408
00:18:32,561 --> 00:18:35,702
usually starting with the very open, make it look cool.

409
00:18:35,702 --> 00:18:39,863
And there's a billion directions that you can take this in.

410
00:18:39,863 --> 00:18:43,104
But by going through that process of describing the puzzle,

411
00:18:43,104 --> 00:18:46,725
we can narrow that possibility space in a meaningful way

412
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:50,326
and find some things that maybe we hadn't considered before.

413
00:18:50,326 --> 00:18:53,126
So how would I describe this puzzle?

414
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:56,007
It is vertical. It has three structures.

415
00:18:56,742 --> 00:18:57,503
It has turrets.

416
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,485
It's layered.

417
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:01,887
The top of structures can move.

418
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:05,651
They rotate, they teleport, and they repeat.

419
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:12,558
So once I have this list of words that I think objectively describes the puzzle,

420
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,002
I'll pull out the ones that I think are the most important.

421
00:19:17,807 --> 00:19:22,891
In this case we had rotation, repeated elements, and layers.

422
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:26,174
I'll write that down and anything I can think of related to those words,

423
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:28,856
trying to keep my mind in that open mode.

424
00:19:28,856 --> 00:19:31,598
And gathering reference, anything goes.

425
00:19:31,598 --> 00:19:34,400
And this is where having done those randomness exercises

426
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,781
with stuff like Shiratori can really help you.

427
00:19:36,781 --> 00:19:40,344
You'll find that the possibility space that you go to becomes

428
00:19:45,993 --> 00:19:47,493
So what did we end up with for reference?

429
00:19:47,493 --> 00:19:50,034
For layers, we ended up with references like Fordite

430
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:53,336
and Licorice and Exploded Views.

431
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:55,817
For repetition, we had a lot of food.

432
00:19:55,817 --> 00:19:59,258
We looked at Wayne Tebow and shop displays.

433
00:19:59,258 --> 00:20:00,959
And for rotation, we had Ferris wheels,

434
00:20:00,959 --> 00:20:02,079
spinning tops, music boxes.

435
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:04,540
And we gather all of that into a Pinterest board

436
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,081
to start with usually.

437
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:09,622
But after that, we almost always ended up

438
00:20:09,622 --> 00:20:12,303
printing things out and moving to a physical board.

439
00:20:13,444 --> 00:20:16,407
So we have a real culture at S2 around these boards

440
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:17,668
and printing things out in general.

441
00:20:17,668 --> 00:20:22,813
We're always printing everything and sticking it up on our walls

442
00:20:22,813 --> 00:20:23,834
and on foam core.

443
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:25,856
We actually printed out the entire game

444
00:20:25,856 --> 00:20:28,578
and we have it on a wall at the studio

445
00:20:28,578 --> 00:20:31,501
and it helps us make decisions about things like color.

446
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:33,923
Is there too much pink in this part of the game?

447
00:20:33,923 --> 00:20:37,366
Is it too dark here when we're trying to tell a narrative that's light?

448
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:38,287
It's much easier.

449
00:20:39,232 --> 00:20:42,054
to glance across a wall and understand these things

450
00:20:42,054 --> 00:20:43,795
than it is to click through JPEGs.

451
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:46,816
And you end up with insights that you do not see

452
00:20:46,816 --> 00:20:48,257
without seeing the whole.

453
00:20:48,257 --> 00:20:50,658
The same goes for the boards.

454
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:53,520
You end up seeing patterns that you didn't see

455
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,621
when it was digital and on a Pinterest board.

456
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,822
For this board in particular, one of the things

457
00:20:57,822 --> 00:21:00,964
that popped out that I didn't see before was a color scheme.

458
00:21:00,964 --> 00:21:03,785
It was this warm pale pink, it was a turquoise blue,

459
00:21:03,785 --> 00:21:06,367
and yellow with accents of black that kept coming out.

460
00:21:07,786 --> 00:21:12,670
I like having them around too because I'm someone who stares off into space a lot and

461
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:17,313
I cannot tell you how many times just having my reference material in my line of vision

462
00:21:17,313 --> 00:21:23,738
when I was staring off into space instead of a JPEG on my desktop ended up inspiring

463
00:21:23,738 --> 00:21:24,379
a solution.

464
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:28,482
They're also really great to have around if you have a really important visitor to the

465
00:21:28,482 --> 00:21:32,345
studio and you need to quickly walk them through the project.

466
00:21:32,345 --> 00:21:34,587
And speaking of playing with others earlier.

467
00:21:35,521 --> 00:21:37,963
It invites other people to take part.

468
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,825
The programmer who sits on the other side of the office

469
00:21:41,825 --> 00:21:43,926
probably isn't going to go surfing through my Pinterest

470
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:46,068
boards, even if I've opened it to them.

471
00:21:46,068 --> 00:21:49,450
But if they're surfing by my desk and they see something

472
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,132
that piques their interest or something that they have

473
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:56,635
knowledge about, it might start a dialogue.

474
00:21:56,635 --> 00:21:58,136
It invites conversation.

475
00:21:58,136 --> 00:21:58,996
It invites collaboration.

476
00:21:58,996 --> 00:22:00,117
And it invites other people's insights.

477
00:22:00,117 --> 00:22:02,178
So back to the level.

478
00:22:02,178 --> 00:22:03,879
These are the sketches that we liked the most in the end.

479
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:05,000
And we usually kept it pretty rough.

480
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:09,089
And you can see the influence of the references here.

481
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:13,492
The licorice, the layers, Waintebo's repetition.

482
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:17,575
They're all chosen because they in some way related

483
00:22:17,575 --> 00:22:20,517
specifically to the mechanics that we broke down by

484
00:22:20,517 --> 00:22:21,558
objective description.

485
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:23,599
And this was the final result.

486
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:26,981
And there's a lot of these principles that we talked

487
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:30,163
about that went into making this level and other levels of

488
00:22:30,163 --> 00:22:30,964
Monument Valley too.

489
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:41,274
other people in, and things like having a practice of meditation and some easy-to-

490
00:22:41,274 --> 00:22:46,458
impose internet restrictions also helped. So that wraps up the talk. What are our

491
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:51,842
takeaways here? How do you work this muscle? How do you get better at ideation

492
00:22:51,842 --> 00:22:57,387
and inspiration? So first, keep this idea of open mode and closed mode in the back

493
00:22:57,387 --> 00:23:00,710
of your head. If you haven't seen it, I would highly recommend checking out that

494
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:04,413
John Cleese talk. Are you going into closed mode too quickly because it's

495
00:23:04,413 --> 00:23:04,753
easier?

496
00:23:06,382 --> 00:23:07,623
Try out mindfulness.

497
00:23:07,623 --> 00:23:12,065
It might help you get into a better headspace for ideation.

498
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:14,006
I know that it certainly helped me.

499
00:23:14,006 --> 00:23:16,447
Practice objectively describing things.

500
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:19,569
It will help you find that seemingly irrelevant

501
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:22,791
information that could be the answer to your problem

502
00:23:22,791 --> 00:23:25,752
and help you come up with more elegant design solutions.

503
00:23:25,752 --> 00:23:27,493
Practice being random.

504
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:30,655
It will make you better at brainstorming and creating

505
00:23:30,655 --> 00:23:32,576
new and interesting connections.

506
00:23:32,576 --> 00:23:34,016
Try stuff like Shiratori.

507
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:34,757
Try word games.

508
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:35,377
Try divination.

509
00:23:36,988 --> 00:23:39,791
With others, if I learned anything at Zynga,

510
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,533
it is that everything is better with friends.

511
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:44,816
And remember to play nice and play safe.

512
00:23:44,816 --> 00:23:48,199
Try something improvised.

513
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:49,320
Remember to yes and.

514
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,043
Use physical things when possible.

515
00:23:52,043 --> 00:23:53,644
It helps invite others to come play too.

516
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:56,527
And I think most importantly,

517
00:23:56,527 --> 00:23:58,169
remember that you can get better at this.

518
00:23:58,169 --> 00:24:00,131
If you are feeling uninspired.

519
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:02,678
or like you are not very creative,

520
00:24:02,678 --> 00:24:03,939
it does not mean that there is something

521
00:24:03,939 --> 00:24:06,420
innately wrong with you, or that you are untalented,

522
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,000
or that you are bad.

523
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,900
You are not a hack.

524
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,301
I think that is a story that a lot of us

525
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:14,382
tell ourselves about creativity and inspiration

526
00:24:14,382 --> 00:24:16,122
that is just not helpful.

527
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:18,763
If you find this stuff hard, it just means it's a muscle

528
00:24:18,763 --> 00:24:19,963
that you haven't been working,

529
00:24:19,963 --> 00:24:22,104
and I promise you, you can get better at it.

530
00:24:22,104 --> 00:24:22,404
And that's it.

531
00:24:22,404 --> 00:24:26,085
I believe in you guys, and you have totally got this.

532
00:24:40,505 --> 00:24:46,009
Does anybody have any questions?

533
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:49,151
Hi, great talk.

534
00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:50,352
Thank you.

535
00:24:50,352 --> 00:24:52,393
I really enjoyed it.

536
00:24:52,393 --> 00:24:55,315
I also seen that creative talk that John Glees did,

537
00:24:55,315 --> 00:24:56,836
and I think it's really good.

538
00:24:56,836 --> 00:24:59,718
I think he talked about when he does those kind of...

539
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:04,159
those creative clearing your mind spaces.

540
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,142
It's like a two hour process or something like that.

541
00:25:08,142 --> 00:25:10,263
Do you take those kind of sessions yourself?

542
00:25:10,263 --> 00:25:13,666
Or do you kind of find that you have kind of grown out

543
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:14,626
of that at least?

544
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:19,710
So at S2, we do tend to time box brainstorming sessions

545
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,712
that I think are sort of open mode.

546
00:25:22,712 --> 00:25:26,595
But yeah, I think we do have specific times that

547
00:25:26,595 --> 00:25:27,375
are for this.

548
00:25:30,108 --> 00:25:34,473
Cool, thanks.

549
00:25:34,473 --> 00:25:39,458
Yeah, thank you.

550
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:39,598
No?

551
00:25:39,598 --> 00:25:39,678
Okay.

552
00:25:39,678 --> 00:25:39,859
Oh.

553
00:25:39,859 --> 00:25:42,141
All right, thank you.
