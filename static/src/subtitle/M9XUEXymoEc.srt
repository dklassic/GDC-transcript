1
00:00:05,927 --> 00:00:07,008
Alright, let's fire this up.

2
00:00:07,489 --> 00:00:08,290
More room for my nudes.

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,311
The nudes.

4
00:00:10,532 --> 00:00:10,992
Hello.

5
00:00:11,853 --> 00:00:13,875
Hello everybody, we're gonna get started now.

6
00:00:13,895 --> 00:00:15,337
So those of you who are wandering in,

7
00:00:15,517 --> 00:00:16,978
wander quickly and sit quietly.

8
00:00:17,038 --> 00:00:19,221
And everybody else, let's rock and roll.

9
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:21,223
In the tradition of the failure workshop,

10
00:00:21,263 --> 00:00:23,885
we have had some failures in room scheduling and AV.

11
00:00:24,005 --> 00:00:25,747
So, we're all set already.

12
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:28,554
and a failure in making a too obvious joke.

13
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:29,054
OK.

14
00:00:30,335 --> 00:00:33,998
So Failure Workshop is a session that I really love.

15
00:00:34,018 --> 00:00:36,199
And so we resurrected it last year

16
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:37,680
after it had been gone for a couple of years.

17
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:44,225
And the brief is basically that in our industry,

18
00:00:44,526 --> 00:00:46,307
and particularly at conferences where

19
00:00:46,387 --> 00:00:49,149
people are worried about appearing competent,

20
00:00:51,102 --> 00:00:52,403
We don't want to discuss our failures.

21
00:00:52,503 --> 00:00:54,445
But I actually find that when you're discussing failures

22
00:00:54,505 --> 00:00:55,646
with people is when you really get

23
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:58,208
to the good, meaty, delicious parts of what will actually

24
00:00:58,248 --> 00:01:00,129
inform your design practice and make you better at things.

25
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:00,930
And we're weird.

26
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,692
We don't want people to know that we have failed.

27
00:01:03,712 --> 00:01:04,993
We want to cover up these failures.

28
00:01:05,553 --> 00:01:09,516
And collectively, if we can all agree to sort of hold hands

29
00:01:09,576 --> 00:01:13,439
and all fail together, and we can think about those failures,

30
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:14,680
I think we can agree that we're all

31
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,482
going to be better developers for it and happier people

32
00:01:17,842 --> 00:01:20,224
if we don't have to be hiding our failures all this time.

33
00:01:21,154 --> 00:01:27,198
Um, which really sucks. It's kind of how it is. Um, was there

34
00:01:27,218 --> 00:01:30,119
anything else I wanted to say about... It's sort of the

35
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:36,243
therapy workshop. Yeah, totally. Um, yeah. And so that's the

36
00:01:36,303 --> 00:01:38,865
impetus behind having this workshop. So, in fact, we had

37
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:43,148
multiple cancellations this year. Uh, and I think that

38
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:46,790
speaks to how hard the, our industry has gotten this year

39
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,832
relative to years past. And I think that in particular this

40
00:01:50,092 --> 00:01:50,673
workshop is...

41
00:01:51,315 --> 00:01:54,658
more important this year than in years when things are going extremely well.

42
00:01:54,938 --> 00:01:59,762
And we have a whole panel about the so-called indiepocalypse, which, you know, whatever,

43
00:02:00,062 --> 00:02:01,083
we'll talk more about that later.

44
00:02:01,123 --> 00:02:05,046
But I do think that the fact that people were canceling out of the failure workshop, not

45
00:02:05,086 --> 00:02:08,789
wanting to share their failures, is a symptom of the fact that things are getting tougher

46
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,973
and tighter and it makes this type of gathering of all you beautiful people getting together

47
00:02:12,993 --> 00:02:14,895
and thinking about these kinds of things all the more important.

48
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:18,607
So today we have three failure workshop speakers.

49
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:22,309
We have Paul from Mode 7 Games, who made a game called

50
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:24,291
Frozen Cortex he's going to talk about.

51
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,672
Kaim's going to talk about Earth Primer.

52
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:29,034
You're not going to talk about it.

53
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:30,955
You don't know what I'm going to talk about.

54
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:31,936
I don't know what I'm going to talk about.

55
00:02:32,096 --> 00:02:34,518
It was the last minute to fill in, so we're not really sure

56
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:35,518
what Kaim's going to talk about.

57
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:36,999
Hopefully he doesn't fail too hard.

58
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,242
And Joe is going to talk about the sophomore slump

59
00:02:41,262 --> 00:02:43,544
phenomenon relative to his successful, I'm going to call

60
00:02:43,564 --> 00:02:44,865
it successful game, Tower of Goods.

61
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:46,848
I'm sorry, he's going to go first.

62
00:02:46,908 --> 00:02:47,728
Let's give it up for Joe.

63
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:56,074
Joe Marabello.

64
00:02:56,314 --> 00:02:56,874
Hello, everybody.

65
00:02:57,255 --> 00:02:59,776
I'm Joe Marabello, and I made a game called Tower of Guns.

66
00:03:00,957 --> 00:03:04,019
Quick background, Tower of Guns was a roguelite first person

67
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,921
shooter that I released about two years ago.

68
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:09,583
I'd been working as a tech artist for a large studio that

69
00:03:09,603 --> 00:03:10,664
went out of business before that.

70
00:03:11,686 --> 00:03:13,987
And instead of moving on to a new company when that company went out of business,

71
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,907
instead of moving to another game dev, I decided I would go ahead and try and do my own thing.

72
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:21,088
So I'd take a couple of months and make this kind of as a learning project.

73
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:23,769
I hoped that it would sell a couple thousand copies,

74
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:26,710
and it went on instead to sell a couple hundred thousand copies.

75
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,451
It was not a runaway super blockbuster kind of hit,

76
00:03:30,531 --> 00:03:32,591
but it did pretty well for a small indie project.

77
00:03:34,111 --> 00:03:37,552
And I expected the project to be kind of a small sabbatical from AAA,

78
00:03:37,572 --> 00:03:39,453
and I kind of expected to go back into the...

79
00:03:40,465 --> 00:03:44,489
AAA industry afterwards, and instead this became the beginning of a new career path.

80
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,934
Now I'd heard about post-release blues a lot. I understood it as a very common depression

81
00:03:50,954 --> 00:03:55,578
that happens after developers ship a project. But I never really gave it much thought. I'd

82
00:03:55,618 --> 00:04:00,021
shipped a couple of games before, prior in my career, back when I worked for larger companies,

83
00:04:00,702 --> 00:04:05,165
and I didn't think that this post-release blues would really affect me. I was under

84
00:04:05,185 --> 00:04:09,028
the impression that post-release blues were for people who identified too much with their

85
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:09,609
pet projects.

86
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:14,114
And so that when they released them, they kind of felt this suddenly hollow feeling

87
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,716
from releasing their project basically to a very cruel and critical world.

88
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:20,717
That wasn't... that was kind of how I understood it.

89
00:04:21,337 --> 00:04:24,899
But that wasn't how post-release blues manifested itself for me at all.

90
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,980
I had no problem getting Tower Guns out the door.

91
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,880
But then I was faced with this.

92
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:33,502
When it came time to start on my second project, I felt a sudden vacuum of purposelessness.

93
00:04:34,082 --> 00:04:35,183
And I didn't know what to move on to.

94
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:37,927
Here's the thing, I had no shortage of ideas.

95
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:40,469
I had ideas coming out of my ears, too many ideas.

96
00:04:40,609 --> 00:04:41,910
My wife was making fun of me because she was like,

97
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,491
you're not going to know what to move on to next

98
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:44,833
because you want to move on to too many things.

99
00:04:46,334 --> 00:04:48,616
But then, instead, when I actually was faced

100
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:50,598
with the opportunity to move on to something new

101
00:04:50,618 --> 00:04:52,900
and exciting, all of those ideas felt like flat.

102
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,021
They all kind of just didn't feel exciting anymore.

103
00:04:58,144 --> 00:04:59,685
So I did what a lot of developers do, I think,

104
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,727
and I retreated back into supporting my game.

105
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:06,486
I put out a lot of patches, I put out updates, I helped out with ports, I focused on promoting the game.

106
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:09,826
This led to the game having a lot more legs than I think it would otherwise have had.

107
00:05:09,846 --> 00:05:13,347
It made its way into a PS Plus deal, into a major Humble bundle.

108
00:05:14,267 --> 00:05:15,948
That focus probably helped make the game stronger.

109
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:20,028
But it was still me avoiding the hard problem, and that hard problem was Project 2.

110
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:23,409
I knew I wanted to work on something that wasn't like Tower of Guns,

111
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:25,570
and I knew that I also wanted to make something quick.

112
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,730
And I knew that sometimes you just need to start something.

113
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,703
So I did what a lot of indies do, and that's I made a little puzzle platformer.

114
00:05:34,824 --> 00:05:38,426
The concept was that the entire level is broken up into slot machine style reels,

115
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,429
and you could spin each section and come up with the best solution on how to progress.

116
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,532
It created some interesting puzzles, requiring the player to essentially mentally traverse a maze

117
00:05:46,552 --> 00:05:51,335
backwards, and then they had to remember how to go forward by realigning the pieces as they played.

118
00:05:53,758 --> 00:05:57,561
After completing the prototype, I looked back and kind of realized the design wasn't all that solid.

119
00:05:57,922 --> 00:05:59,964
People solved the puzzles more out of trial and error.

120
00:06:00,864 --> 00:06:02,546
They couldn't really get a forward read on the puzzles.

121
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:06,009
But I was okay with that realization because that's why you prototype.

122
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,391
So you could get a sense of what works and what doesn't.

123
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:12,275
And I never intended this to be anything other than like a little filler project

124
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:14,837
while I was kind of thinking about what my real project was going to be.

125
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:17,660
In the meantime, I developed a few more mental goals.

126
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:21,212
For example, I had a lot of new tech I wanted to catch up on.

127
00:06:21,312 --> 00:06:25,273
It had been years since I had really been on the cutting edge of game art,

128
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,734
and a lot had happened in the meantime.

129
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:29,755
Back when I worked in AAA, I was an environment artist and tech artist,

130
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:33,896
and while working on Tower of Guns,

131
00:06:35,216 --> 00:06:38,057
I really... like, the art in Tower of Guns was really, really, really rushed,

132
00:06:38,157 --> 00:06:40,558
and I feel like the entire game dev cycle of that was...

133
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:44,139
had more in common with Game Jams than with my work in AAA.

134
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:47,740
And so I really wanted to make something that felt like it looked better than Tower of Guns.

135
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:52,986
However, being a former full-time artist, I knew that art could come later.

136
00:06:53,686 --> 00:06:55,306
I knew that I didn't need to focus on it yet.

137
00:06:55,946 --> 00:06:58,587
I hit a couple of spots where I dove into art polish too soon

138
00:06:59,407 --> 00:07:01,548
on the subsequent prototypes that I'll show,

139
00:07:01,688 --> 00:07:05,769
but usually I was pretty good at keeping things to programmer art.

140
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:08,309
And that's important. I'll get more into that a little bit later.

141
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,970
So my next prototype was this little game that I call Design My Kitchen.

142
00:07:13,984 --> 00:07:18,748
You had to plan out a kitchen layout in order to maximize counter space, floor space, and storage space.

143
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:23,991
And you were kind of given point requirements for each room, and you had like a budget of how much you could spend,

144
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:27,674
and how much each piece cost, and how many pieces you could use.

145
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:30,616
And the idea was that you had to balance certain requirements for rules,

146
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:34,158
certain kinds of multipliers against each other in order to meet the requirements.

147
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:37,000
I was actually having my kitchen redone at this point.

148
00:07:38,232 --> 00:07:38,972
It was inspiring.

149
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:40,634
Like, that gave me the idea.

150
00:07:40,654 --> 00:07:41,254
I was like, you know what?

151
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,555
I'm kind of planning out my own game.

152
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:43,456
Maybe they'll make a good game.

153
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:44,336
I was feeling very inspired.

154
00:07:45,337 --> 00:07:47,159
And it was kind of a cool idea for a prototype, I guess.

155
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,400
I had a couple ideas on where to take it,

156
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,902
but I realized that I was having more fun building the prototype

157
00:07:51,922 --> 00:07:53,303
than actually designing the puzzles.

158
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:55,665
And that was a huge red flag for me.

159
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:58,267
The puzzles weren't fun to design.

160
00:07:58,647 --> 00:07:59,808
If the puzzles weren't fun to design,

161
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:00,889
then they wouldn't be fun to play.

162
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:04,752
That was at least my personal opinion about design.

163
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,134
This prototype went on for a couple of weeks.

164
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:09,941
And during that time, my actual kitchen remodeling

165
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:12,963
in real life went from new and exciting to, holy cow,

166
00:08:13,003 --> 00:08:13,944
why can't this be finished?

167
00:08:14,684 --> 00:08:16,166
And suddenly, it didn't seem so fun

168
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:17,907
to be thinking about kitchens all the time.

169
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:21,830
By now, a few months had gone on since Tower of Guns release,

170
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,231
and fans were beginning to ask me

171
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:24,532
about what I was working on next.

172
00:08:24,812 --> 00:08:28,015
And I realized that people were watching me now.

173
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,497
And I began to get nervous about whether or not

174
00:08:30,617 --> 00:08:31,617
I would have something they would like.

175
00:08:31,838 --> 00:08:34,400
I mean, would Tower of Guns fans like a game

176
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,140
about building kitchens?

177
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:37,682
Would anybody like a game about building kitchens?

178
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,943
So I added a few more mental goals to my list.

179
00:08:41,743 --> 00:08:43,484
Starting to feel a lot of pressure to develop something.

180
00:08:43,924 --> 00:08:45,925
And I was having trouble getting my feet moving on anything.

181
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:48,786
I was starting to have trouble sleeping at night at this point.

182
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:53,728
This right here is a turn-based, grid-based first-person shooter

183
00:08:53,748 --> 00:08:55,869
because for some reason I thought that would be a good idea.

184
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:59,731
This is a first-person game where you are blind

185
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:01,251
and you can only see things when you bump into them.

186
00:09:02,152 --> 00:09:03,452
The less time we spend on that slide, the better.

187
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:10,036
This is a landscaping RTS called bunniescaping where you had to save your flowers from being eaten by bunnies or else they would procreate.

188
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:14,018
That was more fun when you lost.

189
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,461
So by now months had passed since Towergun's release and I began to panic.

190
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:22,442
I had nothing worth showing for my time.

191
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:26,425
I couldn't stick with any plan long enough to validate whether or not it was good or bad.

192
00:09:26,725 --> 00:09:28,306
I just kept ping-ponging between projects.

193
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:29,787
I was sleeping terribly.

194
00:09:30,058 --> 00:09:34,181
I was feeling sick often, and I was basically in a full-on sophomore slump at this point.

195
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:40,746
This is a little first-person shooter prototype where I got caught up in playing with the art technique and kind of lost interest in it.

196
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:43,888
I don't even remember what this was.

197
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:47,270
And I don't remember what this one is either.

198
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:51,173
Like, I was building tons of these things, dozens of them.

199
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:56,385
And I began questioning myself as a developer.

200
00:09:56,845 --> 00:10:01,187
I mean, as a former AAA dev, and as an indie who had made a game that had been played by thousands of people at this point,

201
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:03,067
I was supposed to know what I was doing.

202
00:10:04,028 --> 00:10:06,929
And I knew that I had learned so much, and I was still floundering anyway.

203
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:09,670
And then a new goal was added to my list.

204
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,171
My wife was pregnant, and I was going to be a father.

205
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:16,152
And for some reason, that created this firm line in my mind.

206
00:10:16,552 --> 00:10:18,173
I knew that things wouldn't be the same after that.

207
00:10:20,073 --> 00:10:22,196
I couldn't afford to be stupid with my time after she was born.

208
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:26,703
So I sunk my teeth into the prototype that I happened to be working on at that time and said,

209
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:28,806
this is it. I'm building this. No turning back.

210
00:10:30,248 --> 00:10:31,710
And that prototype was called Fulfillment Center.

211
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:38,493
The basic idea is that I was inspired by reading about the automation of Amazon's warehouse fulfillment centers.

212
00:10:38,954 --> 00:10:42,296
There were these little Roomba delivery bots that they had made.

213
00:10:42,316 --> 00:10:46,279
It's pretty cool stuff, but in this prototype you basically played a more humanoid robot,

214
00:10:46,299 --> 00:10:53,185
living in a not-so-distant future warehouse, running around fulfilling purchase orders for customers that you never see.

215
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:56,147
And along the way you struggle to meet your weekly quotas,

216
00:10:56,367 --> 00:11:00,971
you customize the warehouse and your little prison cell-style room to your liking as you progress.

217
00:11:01,311 --> 00:11:02,812
You make friends with the other robots around.

218
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:07,911
Basically, there was no action, there was no puzzles, there was just narrative.

219
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:10,913
But, like I said, I needed to dig my teeth into something.

220
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:15,415
I showed my wife, and she told me to show the game to other devs and see what they thought.

221
00:11:16,136 --> 00:11:20,078
I told her I would have a prototype that would be ready to show within a week.

222
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:24,721
So I built a system to manage inventory, an auditing system, a stat tracker.

223
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:30,305
I made this fun little PDA to tell you what missions you had and how much time you had to complete them.

224
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,071
I made the warehouse expand over time, over the game's length.

225
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:36,691
Now, experienced developers will know where this is going.

226
00:11:37,551 --> 00:11:41,212
I told my wife I'd be ready to show this prototype off within a month.

227
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:46,694
I built a working dialogue system with branching paths that were ready to be localized.

228
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:48,154
I built a quest tracking system.

229
00:11:48,734 --> 00:11:51,335
I built a fully realized save state system with quest tokens and states.

230
00:11:51,355 --> 00:11:57,196
And I was reading every single book I could find on Amazon and Walmart and warehousing software.

231
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:00,357
And I was going to be ready to show this to people within two months.

232
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:04,209
I made a shop system where you could unlock items.

233
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:06,210
I made it so those items affected gameplay.

234
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,851
I made it so that your relationship with your coworkers were tracked

235
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:11,872
and everything was going to be ready to show other people within three months, for sure.

236
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:15,594
So, to make a painful story short, I was getting caught up in the details.

237
00:12:16,054 --> 00:12:18,275
I was making things that didn't help support the core question

238
00:12:18,455 --> 00:12:20,676
and I was hoping the details would save the project.

239
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:22,476
And I knew all this stuff.

240
00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:24,237
This all stuff was like Game Dev 101.

241
00:12:25,197 --> 00:12:27,618
And while I was doing it, I knew I was doing it.

242
00:12:28,565 --> 00:12:30,187
I still did it even though I knew I was doing it.

243
00:12:30,787 --> 00:12:34,029
I mean, I'm a fairly young designer when it comes to the design side of things,

244
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:37,332
but I mean, I've been in games for 10 years now working as an artist,

245
00:12:37,552 --> 00:12:40,814
and I know that it's important to test core hooks,

246
00:12:40,954 --> 00:12:43,236
and I know how important it is to not get caught up in the details,

247
00:12:43,956 --> 00:12:46,918
and I know how crucial it is to show others the idea early on.

248
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:50,781
And I knew this project had issues, but I still couldn't help myself.

249
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:54,203
I couldn't look my wife in the eye or myself in the mirror

250
00:12:54,263 --> 00:12:56,125
and say that I needed to scrap another project.

251
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:04,142
because it was indulgent or heavy-handed or boring or had bad gameplay or whatever excuse I had in my mind that made this project unfinishable.

252
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:09,443
Because that's the thing, that not all these ideas are terrible. Some of these ideas actually had some interesting things behind them.

253
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:13,924
Some of them, some of the prototypes actually did a great job of proving that there was something there I could explore.

254
00:13:14,804 --> 00:13:22,385
But my confidence was shattered at this point. And whatever compelling elements some of these prototypes had, none of them were enough to keep me moving forward.

255
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:25,539
So back to Performance Center real quick.

256
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:26,940
One week stretched into one month,

257
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,321
then into two months, then into three.

258
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,642
And the further that tailspin went,

259
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:31,003
the harder it was for me to show people.

260
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:33,325
When I finally did show a handful of friends

261
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,228
the actual demo, it kind of confirmed my fears.

262
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:40,631
I'm not someone who believes that every game needs to be fun,

263
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:41,852
but I do think that every game needs

264
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:42,832
to have something compelling.

265
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:44,454
And this particular prototype didn't

266
00:13:44,474 --> 00:13:46,675
have anything compelling, at least

267
00:13:46,715 --> 00:13:47,716
in its current manifestation.

268
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,599
Looking at this screenshot, the thing

269
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:53,681
that I'm most proud of in this particular prototype.

270
00:13:54,253 --> 00:13:58,034
was that was what's not there. For all the time I spent on systems and tools

271
00:13:58,374 --> 00:14:02,155
at least I didn't spend any time on the art. I was confident enough in my art

272
00:14:02,195 --> 00:14:06,256
abilities that I didn't need to concern myself with that yet.

273
00:14:07,176 --> 00:14:09,336
Now why couldn't I do the same thing with the design or the code?

274
00:14:10,156 --> 00:14:14,337
And catch myself earlier? It was because I made tower guns. Because this was not my first

275
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:18,538
project. This was project two. And I didn't feel like I could show anyone anything

276
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:21,438
that was any worse than what I'd already shown.

277
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:25,585
There were expectations now from others, but mostly from myself.

278
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:30,586
And I wanted to show the world that I had improved as a developer,

279
00:14:30,606 --> 00:14:33,668
and that meant showing nothing until I was satisfied.

280
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:39,830
This would be very difficult to talk about if I were still in the thick of it.

281
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:43,892
I've been pretty candid because this is in the past now.

282
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:46,487
But rebuilding my own confidence has been pretty slow.

283
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:48,668
My daughter was born a few months back.

284
00:14:49,109 --> 00:14:50,570
And wouldn't you know it, the world didn't end.

285
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,271
I'm still able to make games.

286
00:14:52,771 --> 00:14:53,952
And now I have a little buddy to help me.

287
00:14:55,212 --> 00:14:58,434
Additionally, shortly after this prototyping train wreck,

288
00:14:58,714 --> 00:14:59,995
a second project finally did stick.

289
00:15:00,795 --> 00:15:02,376
I can't say it's a much better fit for me,

290
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,457
but I can't really say too much about it.

291
00:15:03,497 --> 00:15:05,098
I'm actually contractually not allowed

292
00:15:05,118 --> 00:15:06,179
to talk about it any more than that.

293
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:09,460
But I can say that, most importantly, I actually

294
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,141
have partners now.

295
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:12,722
For the first time in years, first time in four years,

296
00:15:12,983 --> 00:15:13,423
co-workers.

297
00:15:14,282 --> 00:15:17,463
And that's already creating an ecosystem of shared confidence.

298
00:15:18,323 --> 00:15:20,344
And I think that's crucial for combating some of the problems

299
00:15:20,364 --> 00:15:21,164
that I was facing here.

300
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:24,246
I mean, everyone goes through confidence ebbs and flows.

301
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:27,187
And teammates, by their simple presence,

302
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:29,588
basically offer daily validation for what

303
00:15:29,868 --> 00:15:30,748
you guys are building together.

304
00:15:31,868 --> 00:15:35,290
A few more positive things that I should end with.

305
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,431
First, if this is going to happen,

306
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,211
It's good to have it happen to a solo dev with an existing

307
00:15:41,251 --> 00:15:41,912
revenue stream.

308
00:15:41,932 --> 00:15:44,132
I mean, I had a really ridiculously low burn rate.

309
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:46,813
My only real loss was a few months of my own time

310
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:47,994
and my pride.

311
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,534
Both of those are not the worst of casualties.

312
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:53,275
And I also came out of this process learning a few things.

313
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,936
I think it's, I've heard that it's

314
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:57,497
bad business to chalk up any failure as a learning

315
00:15:57,537 --> 00:15:59,177
experience, but I don't believe that.

316
00:15:59,337 --> 00:16:01,878
I believe that there is value to improve technical expertise

317
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:05,379
and to increase tool comfort and to an improved instinct

318
00:16:05,419 --> 00:16:06,980
about what makes good prototypes.

319
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,664
And most importantly, I think I've

320
00:16:10,764 --> 00:16:12,705
learned to trust myself a little bit more.

321
00:16:13,585 --> 00:16:15,326
That's the hardest part about being a designer for me.

322
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:17,908
I trusted myself as an artist.

323
00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:20,209
I knew that I could make something look decent later on

324
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:21,330
once I found a road to commit to.

325
00:16:23,291 --> 00:16:25,132
Why didn't I have the ability to trust my own design

326
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:25,913
sense that same way?

327
00:16:26,133 --> 00:16:27,834
Why couldn't I avoid fussing over details?

328
00:16:27,894 --> 00:16:29,114
Why couldn't I listen to my instincts

329
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:30,936
and redirect a project when I knew it wasn't going

330
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:31,956
to go the way I wanted it to?

331
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:34,518
I didn't trust myself early enough to show the work

332
00:16:34,538 --> 00:16:34,858
early to others.

333
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:39,264
And I didn't trust myself to recover from failure

334
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:39,805
when it happens.

335
00:16:41,086 --> 00:16:43,588
Failure happens sooner or later to everybody.

336
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:45,390
Multiple times it happens.

337
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,771
And when it happens, I think that in the future,

338
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,753
I'm a little better equipped to deal with it.

339
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:51,855
And that's because I'm starting to see failure

340
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:53,296
as a road to improvement.

341
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:56,639
This goes back to something a friend, a badass artist,

342
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:57,119
once told me.

343
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,122
He said that the difference between a master artist

344
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:02,764
and a student is only about 10 feet.

345
00:17:03,504 --> 00:17:05,766
That's just a 10-foot tall stack of paper

346
00:17:05,806 --> 00:17:06,947
with a terrible drawing on each one.

347
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:08,978
And I feel like in this last year,

348
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:10,999
I churned through a big chunk of that 10 fee.

349
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,120
Thanks.

350
00:17:18,524 --> 00:17:32,753
No whammies, no whammies.

351
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:38,528
Well, hello everyone. Can you all hear me okay?

352
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:39,789
If I talk...

353
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:40,449
No.

354
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:40,989
No? Okay.

355
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:43,431
That's... Do I have to... Is this mic on?

356
00:17:43,471 --> 00:17:43,731
No.

357
00:17:44,771 --> 00:17:45,032
No.

358
00:17:46,252 --> 00:17:46,933
Give it one second.

359
00:17:46,953 --> 00:17:49,994
Yeah, correct.

360
00:17:50,455 --> 00:17:52,876
I mean, I can shout like this, if you prefer.

361
00:17:53,076 --> 00:17:53,937
Oh! Okay.

362
00:17:55,847 --> 00:17:57,627
I think we might have a little mic action now, too.

363
00:17:57,787 --> 00:17:59,048
I'm going to project.

364
00:17:59,648 --> 00:18:01,649
Project failure across the room.

365
00:18:01,729 --> 00:18:03,069
My name's Paul Kilduff-Taylor.

366
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,250
I'm from a company called Mode 7 Games.

367
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,611
Some of you may have known me before when

368
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:08,892
my name was Paul Taylor.

369
00:18:09,152 --> 00:18:10,732
But when I got married, I decided

370
00:18:10,752 --> 00:18:13,354
that what I needed was a name that nobody could either

371
00:18:13,494 --> 00:18:14,594
pronounce or spell.

372
00:18:15,774 --> 00:18:18,816
So with that in mind, here are some of my favorite misspellings

373
00:18:18,856 --> 00:18:19,276
of my name.

374
00:18:20,037 --> 00:18:22,600
This one, Paul Kildoff, quite good, quite creative.

375
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,124
Kilvas, not even the correct letters in that one.

376
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:31,651
Kiddoff, I like this one, it sounds a little bit like someone bouncing a basketball off the head of a child.

377
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:35,616
Kildoff-Taylot, a good one.

378
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:41,221
The interesting thing about this one is that it's normally the first point of my name that people get wrong.

379
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:42,502
Taylor's quite a common name.

380
00:18:42,602 --> 00:18:44,264
So more points of creativity.

381
00:18:44,304 --> 00:18:46,886
And finally, my favorite one. This was quite a big conference.

382
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,068
I don't know if you can see that.

383
00:18:49,108 --> 00:18:50,189
Paul Kildroth-Jones.

384
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:50,369
So...

385
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:55,494
We don't really need to say anything about that.

386
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:56,996
Oh, wow. Thank you.

387
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:58,797
Oh, that's much more comfortable.

388
00:18:59,057 --> 00:19:00,198
Ah, lovely. Good.

389
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,040
It's great.

390
00:19:03,947 --> 00:19:06,308
Yes, so my talk is about conceptual failure.

391
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:08,509
And what I mean by that is

392
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,972
the kind of, the idea of a game concept as something that combines

393
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:15,353
the kind of core fantasy of the game

394
00:19:15,393 --> 00:19:17,214
with the aesthetic, with the mechanics.

395
00:19:17,754 --> 00:19:20,775
And when that goes wrong, it can go very, very wrong indeed.

396
00:19:20,835 --> 00:19:23,457
Because it's the kind of strange alchemy of those things that...

397
00:19:23,837 --> 00:19:25,798
makes people enjoy games in the first place.

398
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:28,119
So it doesn't matter what you do on top of that.

399
00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:29,580
If you had a conceptual failure,

400
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,021
you're gonna be fighting against that

401
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:32,582
for your entire dev cycle,

402
00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:34,423
and you're certainly gonna be fighting against it

403
00:19:34,663 --> 00:19:36,064
when it comes to PR and marketing.

404
00:19:37,285 --> 00:19:38,766
So yeah, just a quick bit about us.

405
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:39,686
We're Mode7.

406
00:19:39,726 --> 00:19:41,808
We've been making indie games for 10 years.

407
00:19:42,668 --> 00:19:43,248
There's four of us.

408
00:19:43,268 --> 00:19:44,689
We're based in Oxford in the UK.

409
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,453
And if you've heard of us before, it will be for this, a game called Frozen Synapse,

410
00:19:49,613 --> 00:19:52,055
which is a simultaneous turn-based tactical game.

411
00:19:53,136 --> 00:19:56,779
You basically make a plan for the next five seconds of gameplay, your opponent does exactly

412
00:19:56,819 --> 00:20:00,483
the same thing, and the plans play out together at the same time.

413
00:20:01,602 --> 00:20:03,824
Um, yeah, so this game did pretty well.

414
00:20:03,924 --> 00:20:06,787
It came out in 2011 and kind of made our name as a studio.

415
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:11,252
And one of the great things about it was that it was kind of a very immediate game.

416
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:14,956
Uh, when you look at what it looks like, you can kind of imagine the sort of

417
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:18,099
gameplay that you're going to be enjoying as you play the game.

418
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,622
You're going to be making these plans in quite a detailed.

419
00:20:20,998 --> 00:20:24,820
environment, had procedurally generated levels as well, as you can tell that because they're

420
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:31,064
all squares and rectangles. And that was sort of a really interesting project to work on

421
00:20:31,124 --> 00:20:35,406
and something that we found that resonated really well with other people. So when it

422
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:41,510
came time to make our next game, what we wanted to do was take the core of Frozen Synapse

423
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,092
and then add something to it, change the aesthetic.

424
00:20:45,212 --> 00:20:49,135
basically kind of frame it in a way that we thought would make it a bit more accessible.

425
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:58,662
So the idea for the game was Frozen Endzone, which was going to be based on a game that we really loved called Chaos League.

426
00:20:58,702 --> 00:21:02,705
Now, Chaos League was the first adaptation of the Blood Bowl franchise originally,

427
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:06,548
and then the developers, I believe, lost the license someway midway through the process,

428
00:21:06,568 --> 00:21:07,389
but they released their own.

429
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:13,070
So this is a kind of fantastical sports game with orcs and elves and all that kind of thing going on.

430
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,271
It had a really good simultaneous turn-based mode.

431
00:21:15,631 --> 00:21:19,512
So just as Laser Squad Nemesis had inspired Frozen Synapse,

432
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:22,873
Chaos League kind of really underpinned what we wanted to do with Frozen Endzone.

433
00:21:23,273 --> 00:21:25,293
But we didn't really like the kind of fantasy aesthetic,

434
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:28,554
so we thought we'd go for an aesthetic that we hadn't seen for a while,

435
00:21:28,574 --> 00:21:30,094
which is this kind of future sports thing.

436
00:21:30,114 --> 00:21:30,895
This is a game called...

437
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:33,577
Hyperblade, which we always thought looked really good.

438
00:21:34,218 --> 00:21:36,740
And of course, the classic of this genre is Speedball 2,

439
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,741
a really popular game.

440
00:21:38,281 --> 00:21:40,524
And we felt that bringing back this type

441
00:21:40,604 --> 00:21:42,926
of futuristic aesthetic, we always preferred sci-fi,

442
00:21:43,126 --> 00:21:45,889
and then coupling it with this futuristic sport idea

443
00:21:46,129 --> 00:21:48,571
would be something that nobody had really seen before

444
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:50,453
and certainly hadn't been done for a while.

445
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:58,661
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to show you one of the early trailers for Frozen Endzone.

446
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:02,182
If I can actually get to my desktop in the spirit of failure.

447
00:22:03,003 --> 00:22:03,443
There we go.

448
00:22:03,743 --> 00:22:05,184
Right, let's have a quick look at this.

449
00:22:05,244 --> 00:22:08,405
I'm not going to show you all of this, but this was how we announced the game.

450
00:22:08,505 --> 00:22:11,587
So people had known us for a kind of very pared-down aesthetic,

451
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:14,308
so we opened up on this big shot of a stadium.

452
00:22:14,328 --> 00:22:15,449
We thought people would go,

453
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:17,390
well, what the hell's this? It's something completely different.

454
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,691
have to remind people who you are,

455
00:22:19,711 --> 00:22:21,631
which is another thing which is difficult

456
00:22:21,651 --> 00:22:23,972
if you've had a sort of singular indie game that's done quite well.

457
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:25,553
People don't know you as a developer,

458
00:22:25,573 --> 00:22:26,714
they kind of just know your game.

459
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,935
And then we started showing this.

460
00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:31,956
In this you can see we have randomly generated pictures,

461
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:33,757
we have these players running around,

462
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:37,118
and we had a system where it would take your plan

463
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:39,359
and then interpret everything into these

464
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,240
kind of quite elaborate animations

465
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,501
with really nice art.

466
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,702
We had some really great artists working on this game,

467
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:45,882
really great animators as well.

468
00:22:46,422 --> 00:22:51,445
And here is the section of the trailer where we are showing you what the gameplay is.

469
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:54,947
And this is very critical. I'm going to come back to this again later on.

470
00:22:55,487 --> 00:22:58,589
So the idea of it being your decision and showing the planning here,

471
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,490
and then we show that plan interpreted into these cool animations.

472
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:03,992
And we thought that was the core fantasy of the game.

473
00:23:04,052 --> 00:23:09,355
We thought it was going to be something where if you looked at your plan being translated

474
00:23:09,395 --> 00:23:13,017
into these amazing animations, it would be something that really excited people,

475
00:23:13,037 --> 00:23:13,697
really interested them.

476
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:17,792
So there we go. That's enough of that.

477
00:23:18,993 --> 00:23:21,533
However, the response to this was not ideal.

478
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:24,914
Now these are some of the more polite comments that we received.

479
00:23:25,594 --> 00:23:27,195
I'm going to read some of them.

480
00:23:28,255 --> 00:23:30,716
Is this from the same people as Frozen Synapse?

481
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,356
At least that is one soundtrack absolutely sold for me.

482
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,897
People always like our soundtracks irrespective of how terrible our games are.

483
00:23:36,518 --> 00:23:39,319
I'm not that sold about the game, seeing as I'm not that big a football fan.

484
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:42,201
It's mainly about tactics, sure, but it's still about handegg.

485
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:46,024
Now this is the first time I learned the unfortunate term handegg.

486
00:23:46,064 --> 00:23:50,067
It was a word that I was going to see a lot over the course of the four years that we spent working on this game.

487
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:53,768
Now, this really indicated to me that

488
00:23:54,249 --> 00:23:56,730
the one thing we've got critically wrong with the game

489
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,651
was that people thought it was a sports game.

490
00:23:58,711 --> 00:24:01,092
Now, sports games are, obviously, as you all know,

491
00:24:01,492 --> 00:24:04,674
generally action recreations of existing sports.

492
00:24:04,894 --> 00:24:06,815
They thought it was an American football game,

493
00:24:06,915 --> 00:24:08,476
or a football game, if you're American.

494
00:24:11,897 --> 00:24:15,638
And that's not what we wanted. We wanted people to see it as a tactical game.

495
00:24:15,678 --> 00:24:18,479
This was just the fluff around the kind of nice gameplay.

496
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,140
It was there to make the gameplay feel exciting.

497
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:24,062
Suddenly we were kind of caught in this world of people who hated sports.

498
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:27,324
Generally, people who like very, very hardcore tactical games

499
00:24:27,404 --> 00:24:29,326
are not big fans of mainstream sports,

500
00:24:30,006 --> 00:24:31,127
and this was something that we learned.

501
00:24:31,408 --> 00:24:34,190
So we tried a few things to get us out of this.

502
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,352
We changed the name of the game to Frozen Cortex,

503
00:24:36,372 --> 00:24:37,493
which is a much better name,

504
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:38,974
and people couldn't make a funny...

505
00:24:40,615 --> 00:24:41,576
funny nickname out of it,

506
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:43,958
as they did with Friendzone, from the original title.

507
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:47,566
I can't believe I said that word in public.

508
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:47,927
Good.

509
00:24:48,548 --> 00:24:49,829
So we also changed a few things.

510
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:51,251
We changed how the ball looks.

511
00:24:51,311 --> 00:24:53,473
We changed how the goals look to make them look less

512
00:24:53,513 --> 00:24:54,434
like football goals.

513
00:24:55,255 --> 00:24:57,518
We started doing promotional stuff like this,

514
00:24:57,558 --> 00:24:59,700
which shows the game much more as a kind of nerdy

515
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,481
tactical game.

516
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,775
with lots of lines and things, and there's a character talking up there.

517
00:25:04,676 --> 00:25:07,758
We also shifted to much more fantastical settings.

518
00:25:07,778 --> 00:25:11,621
We put out lots of screenshots like this with big particle effects and explosions and stuff,

519
00:25:11,881 --> 00:25:15,344
trying to say, like, yes, this is a sports aesthetic game,

520
00:25:15,404 --> 00:25:17,005
but there's a lot more going on than that.

521
00:25:18,106 --> 00:25:20,748
And yeah, sort of shots of our stadiums like this is kind of,

522
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:25,251
you know, you wouldn't look at this and necessarily think that's a traditional football stadium.

523
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:30,153
So yeah, this was the core of the conceptual problem.

524
00:25:31,654 --> 00:25:37,416
Now, this is a box. It's a box for two games, Strike Commander and Wink My Other Privateer.

525
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:41,338
And it was the most exciting box I'd ever seen in my life when I was about 11.

526
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:45,499
And the reason was that it was so conceptually exciting to me

527
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:48,380
that I was a Wing Commander fan, and then there were these other things

528
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,821
that were like Wing Commander, and that was so exciting.

529
00:25:51,141 --> 00:25:53,902
And on the back of the box, it really kind of goes into detail

530
00:25:53,942 --> 00:25:56,343
about the promise that you get from these games.

531
00:25:56,383 --> 00:25:58,483
And it has this phrase, be what you want to be.

532
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:01,644
And thinking back to all the games that I really, really liked

533
00:26:02,364 --> 00:26:04,725
and what we'd done with Frozen Endzone,

534
00:26:05,585 --> 00:26:08,886
we had this problem where there wasn't a kind of...

535
00:26:09,959 --> 00:26:14,745
core fantasy at the heart of it. Nobody really wanted to be sort of managing a futuristic

536
00:26:14,925 --> 00:26:20,111
sports team with tactical stuff. Nobody really wanted to do that. Whereas being a space pilot,

537
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:23,435
doing all the other things you can do in other types of games, they're fantasies that people

538
00:26:23,475 --> 00:26:24,596
have. They're things that people like.

539
00:26:25,097 --> 00:26:29,798
Now, I've got a slide of Rocket League here, because this is a game that took the sports

540
00:26:29,878 --> 00:26:34,580
aesthetic but it made it so fantastical and so ridiculous that as soon as you see it,

541
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,420
you want to kind of play around with it.

542
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,480
You go, why are there cars?

543
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,661
Why is there a huge ball?

544
00:26:38,701 --> 00:26:40,081
Why is there this weird stadium?

545
00:26:40,421 --> 00:26:44,663
It takes people out of, oh, I hate sports, and it puts them in the mode of, wow, what's

546
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:44,863
that?

547
00:26:44,883 --> 00:26:45,703
I want to try that.

548
00:26:45,943 --> 00:26:47,523
And that's what we'd completely failed to do.

549
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:53,694
So just to kind of wrap up a little bit on some of the most important things here,

550
00:26:53,754 --> 00:26:58,977
I think the concept of a game is really delivered by that core fantasy idea that I talked about.

551
00:26:59,037 --> 00:27:02,919
What are you doing in the game? What do people want to do? What's exciting about the idea?

552
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:06,520
If you get that wrong, it's very difficult to sell these other things.

553
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,400
Immediacy is very important.

554
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,701
Frozen Cortex is not a very immediate game.

555
00:27:10,721 --> 00:27:14,082
You have to learn how to do the tactics, you have to understand the rules.

556
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:15,682
And that hampered us as well.

557
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:19,883
When you have a difficult core fantasy, if the game's not immediate enough,

558
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:24,904
then people won't get over that problem and they won't start advocating it to other people.

559
00:27:25,184 --> 00:27:28,565
The aesthetic, obviously, the visuals, the way you translate that core fantasy,

560
00:27:28,585 --> 00:27:30,065
I think we all understand that's important.

561
00:27:30,485 --> 00:27:31,786
And finally, notability.

562
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:34,788
When someone does something in your game, it has to be notable.

563
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:37,430
If you look at the way journalists often review games,

564
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,872
they will often tell stories about what they did in the game.

565
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:43,194
If you can't tell an exciting story about the thing that you did

566
00:27:43,214 --> 00:27:45,276
that was tied into the core fantasy of the game,

567
00:27:45,816 --> 00:27:47,438
then no one's going to talk about your game.

568
00:27:48,118 --> 00:27:49,520
We hoped that people would talk about their

569
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,361
losses and victories and so on in Cortex

570
00:27:51,381 --> 00:27:53,583
and that did eventually start happening when we built up

571
00:27:53,623 --> 00:27:55,345
a core of players, but it just wasn't enough

572
00:27:55,405 --> 00:27:57,507
to get people through those initial problems.

573
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:59,428
Now, when I hear people talking about their

574
00:27:59,508 --> 00:28:01,430
failures, I often wonder

575
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,432
if the games that they're talking about were any good

576
00:28:03,472 --> 00:28:05,093
at all, because that does matter still,

577
00:28:05,514 --> 00:28:07,195
believe it or not, even in this day of

578
00:28:07,315 --> 00:28:07,976
indiepocalypse.

579
00:28:08,276 --> 00:28:10,597
So, Cortex did okay.

580
00:28:10,637 --> 00:28:11,957
These are some of the better reviews.

581
00:28:12,617 --> 00:28:14,198
That score from PC Gamer is quite nice,

582
00:28:14,538 --> 00:28:15,598
and Eurogame and so on, but

583
00:28:16,438 --> 00:28:18,079
it really wasn't enough to

584
00:28:18,259 --> 00:28:20,200
elevate the game. If you're hampered by

585
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,100
your concept, it doesn't

586
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,101
almost doesn't matter what kind of review

587
00:28:24,141 --> 00:28:26,121
scores you get. People won't even look at the

588
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:28,022
reviews if they don't like the idea of the game.

589
00:28:28,902 --> 00:28:31,745
So, wrapping up on where this has taken us now,

590
00:28:31,925 --> 00:28:34,848
we started work on Frozen Synapse 2, which we announced recently.

591
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:41,233
And the idea behind Frozen Synapse 2 is to take what people liked conceptually about Frozen Synapse,

592
00:28:41,574 --> 00:28:44,576
but then to kind of blow that absolutely out of the water

593
00:28:44,616 --> 00:28:48,400
and just add more stuff to it that we think is core to the main fantasy of the game.

594
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,903
So very quickly, again, I'm just going to show you a little bit of a trailer,

595
00:28:52,223 --> 00:28:55,866
and you'll be able to see the contrast with what we did with that Endzone trailer.

596
00:28:56,447 --> 00:29:00,269
So here you can see, after this little iDubbbz, we get straight into gameplay.

597
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:04,631
One of the things that I found working on that Cortex trailer that I showed you at the start

598
00:29:04,972 --> 00:29:08,754
is that people were dropping off very, very fast when watching the video if they didn't

599
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:12,836
see gameplay straight away. And this is about telling people what your game is for.

600
00:29:13,096 --> 00:29:16,078
What are you doing in the game? What's it going to feel like when I play it?

601
00:29:16,418 --> 00:29:20,261
If you get into that immediately, it helps. This trailer, by the way,

602
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:23,743
has already started to get many more views than that Cortex announcement trailer.

603
00:29:24,243 --> 00:29:27,827
Here you can see we pulled back from the level to show this procedurally generated city.

604
00:29:28,728 --> 00:29:33,173
And the idea behind the game is that you can have this completely generative, vast city,

605
00:29:33,213 --> 00:29:35,135
you can do missions in absolutely any building.

606
00:29:35,575 --> 00:29:37,337
And this is a core fantasy that people like.

607
00:29:37,657 --> 00:29:39,559
When they play Frozen Synapse, they want to...

608
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,263
expand on the experience, they want to take that gameplay to some different places.

609
00:29:44,403 --> 00:29:46,305
So the idea behind that really is just to

610
00:29:46,645 --> 00:29:48,947
feed directly into that set of ideas,

611
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,389
something that we failed to do previously.

612
00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:53,250
So although Cortex was difficult,

613
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,952
it didn't make as much money as Frozen Synapse by a long margin,

614
00:29:55,992 --> 00:29:57,593
but it managed to keep our studio going.

615
00:29:57,913 --> 00:30:01,256
We feel that we've learned some conceptual lessons about how you

616
00:30:01,556 --> 00:30:03,297
design and promote a game

617
00:30:03,918 --> 00:30:06,740
in order to connect your audience with your key ideas.

618
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,561
Thanks very much.

619
00:30:18,745 --> 00:30:19,506
Are we being sent?

620
00:30:22,526 --> 00:30:24,587
You may have to sort of just like stand right here.

621
00:30:26,527 --> 00:30:27,788
This may be your microphone right now.

622
00:30:28,048 --> 00:30:28,168
Oh.

623
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:31,129
We had it here earlier.

624
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:32,349
We changed cables.

625
00:30:33,189 --> 00:30:33,629
Yeah.

626
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:34,770
There we go.

627
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:35,810
That works.

628
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:46,253
Oh yeah, you can hold that mic too.

629
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,331
Yeah, I need another hand.

630
00:30:51,192 --> 00:30:55,414
Do we need to switch something here?

631
00:30:58,396 --> 00:30:59,477
Do we just plug that from?

632
00:31:00,577 --> 00:31:01,998
Yeah, we're up.

633
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:03,219
You're up.

634
00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:03,419
Oh, no!

635
00:31:03,479 --> 00:31:03,779
Oh, no!

636
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:03,959
Oh!

637
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:04,179
Oh!

638
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:04,500
Oh!

639
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:04,560
Oh!

640
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:04,620
Oh!

641
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:04,720
Oh!

642
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:04,820
Oh!

643
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:04,880
Oh!

644
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:04,940
Oh!

645
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,000
Oh!

646
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,080
Oh!

647
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,140
Oh!

648
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,320
Oh!

649
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:05,460
Oh!

650
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:05,600
Oh!

651
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:05,760
Oh!

652
00:31:11,964 --> 00:31:12,424
Oh!

653
00:31:12,444 --> 00:31:12,604
Oh!

654
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:12,824
Oh!

655
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:13,025
Oh!

656
00:31:16,266 --> 00:31:16,367
Oh!

657
00:31:16,407 --> 00:31:16,547
Oh!

658
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:16,627
Oh!

659
00:31:16,647 --> 00:31:16,787
Oh!

660
00:31:16,807 --> 00:31:16,847
Oh!

661
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:16,987
Oh!

662
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:17,087
Oh!

663
00:31:17,107 --> 00:31:17,167
Oh!

664
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:19,124
No, I'm not.

665
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:20,946
It's just black.

666
00:31:22,607 --> 00:31:22,808
OK.

667
00:31:23,889 --> 00:31:24,670
The time is now.

668
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,892
I needed to jump into the water now or never.

669
00:31:27,032 --> 00:31:28,574
Maybe it was now or later, but I didn't

670
00:31:28,594 --> 00:31:29,635
have the patience to find out.

671
00:31:29,815 --> 00:31:30,716
It was time to jump ship.

672
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:34,360
The year was 2007, and I had been working on Spore

673
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,361
for 4 and 1⁄2 years.

674
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:36,963
I had started as an intern in 2002

675
00:31:37,744 --> 00:31:39,105
when the project could have fit comfortably

676
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:40,527
in a very, very small lifeboat.

677
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:44,928
Now, years later, the creature creator, or editors we called it, and all the editors, they were done.

678
00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:48,530
It was years of research and development, and I was proud and happy with my design work,

679
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,392
and the work of all the people who had made the editors so amazing.

680
00:31:51,973 --> 00:31:55,915
While I worked on many parts of the project, the editors, they were my baby, and they were done.

681
00:31:56,016 --> 00:32:00,419
The rest of the project, things were looking so sunny, and I wasn't excited to become deeply involved with them again.

682
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:05,002
We were paying the interest on bad loans that had been made years in the past, and it was slow and painful.

683
00:32:06,322 --> 00:32:08,083
Meanwhile, exciting things were happening

684
00:32:08,163 --> 00:32:09,344
outside of the walls of EA,

685
00:32:09,544 --> 00:32:11,005
outside of the bounds of AAA games.

686
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:12,806
I was 27 years old,

687
00:32:12,946 --> 00:32:14,968
and definitely on my way to becoming an old man.

688
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:17,069
It was time to move on,

689
00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:18,990
to trade in my vanishing youth for adventure,

690
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,191
to do the things you do when you are young,

691
00:32:21,451 --> 00:32:23,673
visit exotic places, create ambitious projects,

692
00:32:24,053 --> 00:32:25,014
and make bad decisions.

693
00:32:26,054 --> 00:32:27,535
It was time to become an indie developer.

694
00:32:28,396 --> 00:32:29,616
Clearly, that's where the action was.

695
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:31,097
The creativity, the autonomy,

696
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:33,159
Braid and World of Goo were about to come out

697
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:34,219
and make boatloads of money.

698
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:35,960
The bounds of the meeting were being pushed.

699
00:32:36,481 --> 00:32:40,664
out there. Out there you had creative autonomy and boatloads of money. Who wouldn't want that?

700
00:32:42,065 --> 00:32:45,328
No large development teams to waste your time. No one else to negotiate with,

701
00:32:45,388 --> 00:32:49,811
just you and the open road. No more producers and their annoying schedules. Who needs schedules?

702
00:32:50,252 --> 00:32:53,314
People who don't know how to make, how to move fast, be creative and nimble,

703
00:32:53,775 --> 00:32:57,938
and think deep thoughts. I had money saved up in the bank. I could find another job if I needed to.

704
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:03,862
It was time for me to do what I could do best. Make cool stuff and prototype it. The rest will

705
00:33:03,902 --> 00:33:04,203
be easy.

706
00:33:08,709 --> 00:33:10,670
Mistake number one, scope.

707
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,891
I made a directory for my project.

708
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:13,871
It was called Eden.

709
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,392
It was a simulation game.

710
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:16,553
There would be a world simulator,

711
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:17,513
and there would be a lot more.

712
00:33:17,593 --> 00:33:18,994
The actual title was Pocket Kingdom.

713
00:33:20,974 --> 00:33:22,755
I got off to a good start, and then immediately started

714
00:33:22,775 --> 00:33:23,696
making a playable game.

715
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:25,737
Two months in, I had a network server

716
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:27,737
and a basic multiplayer RTS game working.

717
00:33:27,918 --> 00:33:28,538
It kind of worked.

718
00:33:29,018 --> 00:33:30,058
I could play against someone.

719
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:33,200
The game would have a single player mode, a multiplayer

720
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,741
versus mode, world building tools, an intricate economy,

721
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:37,102
a people simulator like The Sims.

722
00:33:37,596 --> 00:33:39,858
a sophisticated 3D user interface for making things.

723
00:33:39,878 --> 00:33:41,899
There was a lot of stuff.

724
00:33:41,959 --> 00:33:44,080
At this point, I should probably tell how big the dev team was.

725
00:33:45,041 --> 00:33:45,461
It was me.

726
00:33:45,541 --> 00:33:47,263
It was this guy, this genius right here.

727
00:33:48,523 --> 00:33:50,145
I figured my game wasn't too ambitious.

728
00:33:50,325 --> 00:33:51,405
I mean, it wasn't like we were trying

729
00:33:51,445 --> 00:33:53,127
to simulate the whole universe or anything.

730
00:33:53,607 --> 00:33:55,528
And I could get halfway done with it in no time

731
00:33:55,568 --> 00:33:57,289
and then find some collaborators to help me finish it.

732
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:57,970
It'd be easy.

733
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:00,672
Looking back, it was as if I'd forgotten

734
00:34:00,692 --> 00:34:01,953
that I was no longer on Spore.

735
00:34:02,013 --> 00:34:03,714
I was no longer at a big game company.

736
00:34:06,347 --> 00:34:11,748
where I would just build prototypes and then have engineers and artists to collaborate with and back me up and keep me in check.

737
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:17,650
So this is the situation. I was the brave general leading the charge and there was no cavalry behind me.

738
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:22,411
I didn't even know there was no cavalry. If I did know, I don't think it would have bothered me. Everything was going great.

739
00:34:23,951 --> 00:34:27,572
Turned out that was a big mistake. So onward I plunged deep into the wilderness.

740
00:34:31,964 --> 00:34:33,785
I'm not going to show a lot of screenshots from the thing,

741
00:34:34,465 --> 00:34:37,286
but here's a few to give you a sense.

742
00:34:37,886 --> 00:34:40,307
So mistake number two, trust me, I'm an expert.

743
00:34:41,027 --> 00:34:42,428
My secret weapon was prototyping.

744
00:34:42,688 --> 00:34:45,128
I was an expert at failing fast, at starting over,

745
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,469
at throwing stuff against the walls.

746
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:48,130
I'd done it for years on Spore.

747
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,790
That was one of my superpowers, one

748
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:51,971
of the reasons the editors had come together so nicely.

749
00:34:52,051 --> 00:34:53,931
I'd given talks to GDC about prototyping.

750
00:34:53,951 --> 00:34:54,972
I'd written articles about it.

751
00:34:55,332 --> 00:34:56,252
I knew what I was doing.

752
00:34:56,612 --> 00:34:57,833
I would prototype something playable.

753
00:34:59,035 --> 00:35:00,677
So there was good news and bad news to this.

754
00:35:00,837 --> 00:35:03,100
The good news is that I had some amazing ideas for Prototype.

755
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,222
The bad news was I completely forgot how to do it.

756
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,246
I kept working on this playable Prototype,

757
00:35:08,286 --> 00:35:09,367
this number of multiplayer game.

758
00:35:09,387 --> 00:35:11,370
And meanwhile, development started getting very slow.

759
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:14,053
Where was the economic game, the world simulation,

760
00:35:14,073 --> 00:35:16,216
the M-basis 3D user interface, the people sim?

761
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:19,112
In part, I was feeling the thrill of being an engineer,

762
00:35:19,192 --> 00:35:20,813
of building a multiplayer network system,

763
00:35:20,873 --> 00:35:23,133
of running a not very good 3D graphics engine.

764
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,274
The wind was in my face, and it felt great.

765
00:35:25,334 --> 00:35:26,515
I was learning about 3D graphics,

766
00:35:26,555 --> 00:35:28,116
network simulation code, and all kinds of things,

767
00:35:28,156 --> 00:35:28,956
but I got bogged down.

768
00:35:30,356 --> 00:35:33,658
Five months in, I was distributing a playable 3D game

769
00:35:33,678 --> 00:35:36,439
to some friends that had some combat and world simulation,

770
00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:37,519
but it didn't really fit together.

771
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,320
My ideas were still all over the place,

772
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,761
and the stuff that I had implemented

773
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:41,601
wasn't really jelling.

774
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:44,342
Finally, it dawned on me that I was doing it wrong.

775
00:35:44,822 --> 00:35:45,743
I wasn't prototyping.

776
00:35:46,116 --> 00:35:47,396
I was building the actual game.

777
00:35:48,337 --> 00:35:49,837
Here's another screenshot.

778
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:51,898
I had no idea what game I was making.

779
00:35:51,918 --> 00:35:53,659
And here I was making all this stuff in 3D,

780
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:55,099
a big network simulation game.

781
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,040
It was going very slowly.

782
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,361
It was going too slowly.

783
00:35:59,021 --> 00:36:00,821
And it was a mistake that cost me five months.

784
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:04,443
This is a screenshot from the game join select screen.

785
00:36:04,503 --> 00:36:06,403
And you see there's cute little stars in the background

786
00:36:06,423 --> 00:36:07,804
that are twinkling and animating.

787
00:36:07,844 --> 00:36:09,765
And it's just too much.

788
00:36:10,505 --> 00:36:10,985
It's all wrong.

789
00:36:13,446 --> 00:36:14,627
All right, so mistake number three.

790
00:36:15,701 --> 00:36:16,882
is scope.

791
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:19,064
And here's actually, this is a screenshot of all the builds

792
00:36:19,084 --> 00:36:21,065
that I made in the first year, with all the dates.

793
00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:22,386
I was looking through this last night

794
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:24,067
to get a sense of where I went.

795
00:36:24,728 --> 00:36:26,709
So you see my progress over time.

796
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:31,613
So my big success at this point was

797
00:36:31,653 --> 00:36:33,074
realizing that I was prototyping wrong,

798
00:36:33,114 --> 00:36:35,036
and realizing I needed to actually start prototyping.

799
00:36:35,716 --> 00:36:37,958
So I started making one from 3D to 2D,

800
00:36:38,078 --> 00:36:39,419
and then things got really fast.

801
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:41,941
So I started making world editing tools in 2D,

802
00:36:41,961 --> 00:36:42,561
and then 3D.

803
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:43,642
They were really, really cool.

804
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:47,640
I started building multiple fun, playable economic simulations that people really liked.

805
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:54,003
I made cool simulations of pandemonium here, stuff being built and then stuff being destroyed.

806
00:36:55,804 --> 00:36:57,805
This was made in like a week, two weeks.

807
00:36:58,725 --> 00:37:00,326
This inspired an iPhone game I later made.

808
00:37:00,766 --> 00:37:02,527
I made a fun interactive weather simulation.

809
00:37:02,547 --> 00:37:06,569
I made a sim-style people simulator that was tons of fun in like a week or two.

810
00:37:07,223 --> 00:37:10,344
I made an awesome RTS game with the rhythm and rules I've never seen before,

811
00:37:10,364 --> 00:37:13,065
with results which came out of months of careful research.

812
00:37:13,605 --> 00:37:14,706
I made a world generator.

813
00:37:15,626 --> 00:37:17,947
I made a cool SimCity tower defense hybrid game.

814
00:37:18,687 --> 00:37:20,508
I made a lot of great little great prototypes.

815
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,628
Finally, six months in, I was actually prototyping the game,

816
00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:26,489
but the problem was I still had no idea how it all fit together.

817
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,070
I was discovering all these amazing things.

818
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,331
It was as if my ship had run aground on a coral reef,

819
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:34,012
and I was too busy marveling at all the amazing fish

820
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:35,652
to actually notice that the ship was sinking.

821
00:37:37,061 --> 00:37:41,402
There are things there that I want to go back one day and salvage in this amazing reef, but that will come later.

822
00:37:43,863 --> 00:37:47,745
So the thing that I was missing is the project had no center. Nothing was holding it together.

823
00:37:47,785 --> 00:37:51,367
I wasn't going deep in any one of these things.

824
00:37:51,387 --> 00:37:54,668
I either needed to go deep in one of these directions, become a design genius overnight,

825
00:37:54,728 --> 00:37:57,249
or somehow find a team of 100 to help me actually make this thing.

826
00:37:57,629 --> 00:38:00,150
And the team of 100 wasn't forthcoming, nor was the design genius.

827
00:38:01,578 --> 00:38:05,919
A very smart designer friend of mine told me that I needed to focus, which was a big realization.

828
00:38:05,939 --> 00:38:07,800
I was like, oh yeah.

829
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,821
But he wanted me to finish my project while I was still young.

830
00:38:10,341 --> 00:38:10,821
And he was right.

831
00:38:12,522 --> 00:38:13,642
Part four, finishing is hard.

832
00:38:13,842 --> 00:38:18,284
Thanks to the experimental gameplay project dot com, I spent a couple of days making an iPhone game called MinMe.

833
00:38:19,144 --> 00:38:22,145
It taught me that even finishing something so simple was a lot of work.

834
00:38:22,185 --> 00:38:27,707
So I took another break, a detour, and decided to dabble and experiment with the iPhone user interface

835
00:38:27,747 --> 00:38:29,588
and made this game called Earth Dragon.

836
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:31,781
It was that.

837
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:34,382
It was inspired by one of the prototypes I showed earlier.

838
00:38:34,402 --> 00:38:36,263
It was tiny, and it took a few months to make.

839
00:38:36,403 --> 00:38:37,824
But again, it taught me how much work it

840
00:38:37,844 --> 00:38:38,905
was to actually finish something.

841
00:38:41,146 --> 00:38:42,927
For better or worse, these little successes

842
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:45,629
both humbled me and inspired me to carry on even further.

843
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,431
So I try once again to make something simple and finish it,

844
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:49,552
but floundered again.

845
00:38:49,572 --> 00:38:52,313
I started getting lost in a 3D world in Weather Simulator.

846
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,296
Finishing any product is really hard.

847
00:38:56,456 --> 00:38:57,637
It's important to have focus.

848
00:38:57,817 --> 00:38:59,338
But how do you finish a project whose scope

849
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,598
is sometimes as big as you are?

850
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,026
My scope was still crazy.

851
00:39:02,366 --> 00:39:03,847
I was still the general without the army,

852
00:39:03,888 --> 00:39:05,489
the captain of a shipwrecked vessel

853
00:39:05,889 --> 00:39:06,930
dashed on a lovely ship,

854
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,651
the juggler of too many metaphors

855
00:39:08,691 --> 00:39:09,572
and too many prototypes.

856
00:39:11,693 --> 00:39:13,355
It's hard to finish a project even when it's working.

857
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:14,696
You have to decide you want to stop.

858
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:16,036
You have to set deadlines and hit them.

859
00:39:16,057 --> 00:39:16,917
You have to fix bugs.

860
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:17,738
You have to make lists

861
00:39:17,778 --> 00:39:19,179
and you have to check off things on those lists,

862
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:19,999
and it's a lot of work.

863
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,040
Trade-offs have to be made.

864
00:39:21,501 --> 00:39:22,261
If you've shipped to Optra,

865
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:23,222
you know what I'm talking about.

866
00:39:23,262 --> 00:39:24,543
It's exciting and it's exhausting.

867
00:39:24,983 --> 00:39:26,744
But how do you finish a project that isn't happening?

868
00:39:26,804 --> 00:39:27,725
A project without lists,

869
00:39:27,785 --> 00:39:28,686
a project with no bugs.

870
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,310
Because in some sense, the entire project is one huge bug.

871
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,391
The huge bug that I loved was hooked up

872
00:39:33,411 --> 00:39:34,391
to a life support system.

873
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:36,292
The machine is beeping out its unsteady pulse

874
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,432
and its breathing is unsteady.

875
00:39:37,832 --> 00:39:39,932
I loved it dearly and I put my heart and soul into it,

876
00:39:40,192 --> 00:39:42,053
but clearly it's not going to make it.

877
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:43,493
Its breath is raspy and slow.

878
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:45,654
It's everything I ever wanted and nothing I could ever have.

879
00:39:45,714 --> 00:39:47,574
And somehow, from within deep inside of me,

880
00:39:47,614 --> 00:39:49,895
I had to find the energy to pull the plug.

881
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:51,375
And that was really painful.

882
00:39:52,176 --> 00:39:53,896
I decided to pull the plug and try something else

883
00:39:53,916 --> 00:39:54,616
in my life for a while.

884
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,583
Wrapping up, I haven't heard a lot of failure talk, so I'm not sure if I'm breaking the rules by doing this,

885
00:40:01,903 --> 00:40:04,665
but I want to talk about the silver linings of all of this failure.

886
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:11,409
Because the silver lining is how I find my way in the world.

887
00:40:11,429 --> 00:40:12,929
It's how I keep it together.

888
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:15,691
So I like to limp away from the wreckage of any problem in my life,

889
00:40:15,831 --> 00:40:17,992
whether it's professional or otherwise, on my good foot.

890
00:40:18,012 --> 00:40:20,834
I like to look down on my good foot and feel really lucky about that foot.

891
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:23,651
I like to look up at the glowing mushroom cloud behind me

892
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,532
and marvel how beautiful it is, how

893
00:40:25,572 --> 00:40:26,752
I'm lucky to have gotten to see it.

894
00:40:26,872 --> 00:40:28,873
And maybe if I'm really lucky, I'll get a cool mutation.

895
00:40:30,713 --> 00:40:31,414
I learn so much.

896
00:40:31,474 --> 00:40:33,894
I have a newfound jealous appreciation

897
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:36,195
of people like Jason Rohr, who seem to have an uncanny ability

898
00:40:36,215 --> 00:40:37,756
to pick just the right projects, to pick

899
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:40,236
a super interesting and big and hard problem,

900
00:40:40,636 --> 00:40:42,617
and yet one that's small enough to hold in their hand

901
00:40:42,657 --> 00:40:43,617
and get it done by themselves.

902
00:40:43,637 --> 00:40:45,398
I think that's absolutely an amazing skill.

903
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:49,339
I think I learned things about focusing and about simplicity

904
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,780
and about finding the center in design.

905
00:40:52,073 --> 00:40:53,214
There's just no other way to do it.

906
00:40:54,054 --> 00:40:55,695
I exercised and refined this new ability,

907
00:40:55,735 --> 00:40:57,296
this new mutation in my new project.

908
00:40:57,736 --> 00:41:01,098
I managed to pick up, coming back another year or two later,

909
00:41:01,118 --> 00:41:02,878
and pick up part of that weather simulation

910
00:41:02,898 --> 00:41:05,159
and world generator that I made, and I made this.

911
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,121
Which I don't think is a failure, thanks.

912
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:10,582
Sorry.

913
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:13,003
Sorry, the road that you've used

914
00:41:13,043 --> 00:41:15,184
to get to Earth Primer, that's really cool.

915
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,381
But I think it's interesting, though,

916
00:41:17,421 --> 00:41:18,983
that you're like, well, what are you going to talk about?

917
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,506
Because you're like, I haven't seen the projects that you're

918
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:23,028
going to talk about that's failure because I don't

919
00:41:23,068 --> 00:41:24,449
actually share the failed projects.

920
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:25,090
Right?

921
00:41:25,371 --> 00:41:28,895
That's the point of this session.

922
00:41:28,935 --> 00:41:31,137
They're buried in the graveyard behind our houses.

923
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,981
Like a shallow grave.

924
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:37,148
Here's a shovel.

925
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,449
Yeah, here's a shovel, thanks.

926
00:41:38,469 --> 00:41:39,109
Yeah, exactly.

927
00:41:39,729 --> 00:41:41,410
So anyhow, so yeah, so one day, so anyhow,

928
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,472
see, I'm really happy with how things turned out at the end.

929
00:41:43,492 --> 00:41:45,413
But it's not to say that, but that was like years of work.

930
00:41:45,493 --> 00:41:48,234
And this is sort of the tail end of.

931
00:41:49,195 --> 00:41:50,856
So anyhow, so one day I plan to go back,

932
00:41:50,896 --> 00:41:54,037
go back to that coral reef and salvage more of the treasure

933
00:41:54,057 --> 00:41:54,738
that I found there.

934
00:41:55,118 --> 00:41:56,599
And next time I dive in, I hope that I'll

935
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:59,440
be a little bit more modest, a little wiser, more focused,

936
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,001
and more humble.

937
00:42:00,021 --> 00:42:00,521
Thanks.

938
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:11,030
All right.

939
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:15,531
So we have a little bit of time for questions.

940
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,271
I have some questions here that occurred to me

941
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:20,852
while I was listening to what you guys were saying.

942
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:23,012
This happened last year, too.

943
00:42:23,032 --> 00:42:24,252
We ended up with sort of a theme.

944
00:42:24,693 --> 00:42:28,633
The theme was kind of chasing the correct concept

945
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:29,834
of the correct scope.

946
00:42:29,934 --> 00:42:32,794
And you guys both went through a zillion prototypes.

947
00:42:33,234 --> 00:42:34,074
Yeah, I was feeling some class.

948
00:42:35,035 --> 00:42:36,735
Yeah, there's definitely some like.

949
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,902
Yeah, yeah, why don't you move over to that side, join the group.

950
00:42:41,723 --> 00:42:42,464
All by myself over there.

951
00:42:42,524 --> 00:42:43,104
Ha ha ha.

952
00:42:43,925 --> 00:42:48,429
Um, so I had a question for Paul.

953
00:42:48,749 --> 00:42:52,953
Um, and, and this is, this question actually works really well for you guys too, so you can answer it also.

954
00:42:53,253 --> 00:43:00,780
But how do you feel, uh, in hindsight about having sort of changed your design midstream based on external feedback?

955
00:43:01,106 --> 00:43:05,191
Because I think that a lot of people, I think sort of accepted wisdom is that you're the genius designer

956
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:09,256
and you have this idea for what it's going to be and if you change that midstream then you're compromising your vision.

957
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:14,622
So how do you kind of reconcile that with the practice reality of like, okay, this is garbage, like what am I doing here?

958
00:43:15,002 --> 00:43:16,543
Well, there's a couple of things there.

959
00:43:16,903 --> 00:43:18,825
One is that our lead designer, Ian Hardingham,

960
00:43:18,885 --> 00:43:20,666
is quite a mechanics-focused guy.

961
00:43:21,027 --> 00:43:23,389
So he just wants to find the best way

962
00:43:23,429 --> 00:43:24,470
of showing off the mechanics.

963
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,472
So in terms of pitching the changes as an idea,

964
00:43:27,612 --> 00:43:30,415
he was instrumental in that himself.

965
00:43:30,815 --> 00:43:34,438
But yeah, with Cortex, it really seemed to work.

966
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:35,699
We definitely seem to get.

967
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:41,544
people to start understanding more about what the game really was as we went through those changes.

968
00:43:41,624 --> 00:43:46,968
So even though it kind of can feel like switching horses in midstream to some extent,

969
00:43:47,188 --> 00:43:52,472
you can do some things to mitigate those problems and I'm glad that we made the changes.

970
00:43:53,493 --> 00:43:56,935
What was your strategy for sort of mitigating the problem of changing

971
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,997
so quickly midstream like that or once you're so far along?

972
00:44:00,077 --> 00:44:01,298
We just used it as a PR point.

973
00:44:01,654 --> 00:44:01,994
Yeah.

974
00:44:02,334 --> 00:44:03,115
So it's kind of...

975
00:44:03,135 --> 00:44:03,675
We've heard you.

976
00:44:04,076 --> 00:44:04,256
Right.

977
00:44:04,716 --> 00:44:07,139
It's kind of interesting if a game changes its name,

978
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:09,861
and it's interesting if a developer is kind of reacting to feedback and stuff.

979
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:11,342
So we just talked about that in public and went,

980
00:44:11,563 --> 00:44:13,264
hey, you know, this wasn't coming across the right way.

981
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:17,388
So we got PR focused on, you know, the stuff we wanted it to be focused on.

982
00:44:17,928 --> 00:44:19,830
Yeah. Do either of you guys want to comment on that at all, or...

983
00:44:21,023 --> 00:44:27,088
Also, I think there's a kind of balance between the intellectual producer part of your brain,

984
00:44:27,629 --> 00:44:34,074
like the rational planner, and then there's this dreamer part of you that's responsible for thinking up crazy ideas

985
00:44:34,154 --> 00:44:38,178
and then just not thinking about boundaries, and somehow you have to reconcile those things.

986
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:40,900
I think it's easier to do it if you're collaborative with other people

987
00:44:41,601 --> 00:44:43,102
than if you're trying to do it all by yourself.

988
00:44:44,907 --> 00:44:47,449
One thing that I noticed that struck home to me

989
00:44:47,689 --> 00:44:50,230
was when you were talking about how you had this idea

990
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,472
of the sort of grand, infinite fields of brilliant genius

991
00:44:53,492 --> 00:44:54,613
that you were going to go join, and you

992
00:44:54,633 --> 00:44:56,734
had your own idea internal to you about what

993
00:44:56,774 --> 00:44:57,514
you wanted to create.

994
00:44:58,115 --> 00:44:59,135
But then you sort of got out there,

995
00:44:59,175 --> 00:45:01,757
and you were like running, and you're like, wait, where am I?

996
00:45:01,797 --> 00:45:02,597
What's going on?

997
00:45:02,717 --> 00:45:04,278
So I don't know.

998
00:45:04,298 --> 00:45:06,859
I feel like there's this thing that happens retrospectively

999
00:45:06,879 --> 00:45:08,780
when you look at really good games where you say, OK, well,

1000
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,961
this was really good, and clearly they

1001
00:45:09,981 --> 00:45:11,762
had that core idea the whole time.

1002
00:45:12,122 --> 00:45:14,183
But very often, as a designer, you just kind of like,

1003
00:45:14,655 --> 00:45:17,576
right, that's the thing that I want and you just like run toward it and you get there and you're like,

1004
00:45:17,596 --> 00:45:21,937
okay, well this is not working but I don't know where to go next and like how are you guys

1005
00:45:22,957 --> 00:45:27,198
advancing in your ways of dealing with that I feel like it's kind of like what this has become about.

1006
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:33,320
Well, I mean, we're giving a talk at how we failed at that. Right. In a lot of ways. Yeah. With like

1007
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,701
the aim that people can take their own lessons away from it, I suppose. Right. I mean, I think.

1008
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:42,042
A lot of it comes to the feedback loop, and I think the smaller you are,

1009
00:45:42,062 --> 00:45:44,965
and indies are very small in terms of the size of the studio,

1010
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:49,370
the easier it is for that feedback loop to get into oscillating into something

1011
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:52,954
where you're way off target from where you originally thought that there was something interesting.

1012
00:45:53,935 --> 00:45:57,398
Whereas, I mean, whereas I think a larger studio,

1013
00:45:57,438 --> 00:46:00,882
you're constantly being checked against whether or not something would actually...

1014
00:46:01,689 --> 00:46:07,252
make money, which is another way of saying whether or not people would be interested in it, just from AAA speak.

1015
00:46:07,812 --> 00:46:13,435
But as an indie, you target something very specific and you're like, that's what I want to build.

1016
00:46:14,096 --> 00:46:17,558
And you may be the only one in the world interested in making that or interested in playing that.

1017
00:46:17,638 --> 00:46:22,961
And that's okay if you're a solo dev and you've only got yourself to support, but the larger you get,

1018
00:46:22,981 --> 00:46:26,463
the more you've got mortgages on the line and the more you've got to concern yourself with whether or not

1019
00:46:26,503 --> 00:46:27,783
people are going to be able to feed their families.

1020
00:46:29,717 --> 00:46:32,218
I think that it seems like what you experienced was like,

1021
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:36,441
like, when you showed the game to, like, the world at large,

1022
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:37,761
that's when you had your reality check.

1023
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:39,783
And I feel like that reality check

1024
00:46:39,883 --> 00:46:43,004
can come through at any time for any of us.

1025
00:46:43,165 --> 00:46:45,006
And it's like, I don't know.

1026
00:46:45,466 --> 00:46:47,707
I have a lot of respect for the solo devs

1027
00:46:47,747 --> 00:46:49,368
out there who are able to make their own game,

1028
00:46:49,608 --> 00:46:50,769
and somehow they get to something

1029
00:46:50,789 --> 00:46:51,810
that people want at the end.

1030
00:46:52,968 --> 00:46:55,569
And like that Undertale guy, like that's amazing.

1031
00:46:55,689 --> 00:46:57,389
But even then, I mean, he wasn't working in a vacuum

1032
00:46:57,529 --> 00:46:59,030
because he did have the Kickstarter.

1033
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:03,751
And so he was getting validation immediately about everything

1034
00:47:03,771 --> 00:47:04,331
that he was doing.

1035
00:47:04,811 --> 00:47:05,951
Right, at least to the point where he was like,

1036
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,491
OK, people are kind of interested in this,

1037
00:47:07,671 --> 00:47:09,072
at least enough to support my Kickstarter.

1038
00:47:10,932 --> 00:47:13,733
And I feel like showing the world at least stuff early on,

1039
00:47:13,773 --> 00:47:15,473
I mean, that's the something that I feel like I,

1040
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,073
that was my major failure, was not showing what I was doing.

1041
00:47:18,997 --> 00:47:21,459
Does anybody in the audience, if you want to ask a question,

1042
00:47:21,479 --> 00:47:22,740
feel free to hop up to one of those mics.

1043
00:47:23,581 --> 00:47:24,241
Can you do the mic?

1044
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:24,761
Yeah, awesome.

1045
00:47:24,821 --> 00:47:25,062
Thank you.

1046
00:47:25,402 --> 00:47:28,944
I want to just say that I think people said necessity

1047
00:47:28,964 --> 00:47:29,785
is the mother of invention.

1048
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,987
But I think desperation is the mother of invention.

1049
00:47:32,347 --> 00:47:34,188
And the question is just how desperate you are.

1050
00:47:34,649 --> 00:47:36,510
But if you're too desperate, you're screwed.

1051
00:47:36,810 --> 00:47:37,771
But if you're just desperate enough,

1052
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:39,652
you're going to come up with some really brilliant solutions

1053
00:47:39,672 --> 00:47:40,333
to problems.

1054
00:47:41,373 --> 00:47:45,096
I have a talk desperation-based game design that's in here.

1055
00:47:45,176 --> 00:47:46,257
It'll come out someday, I'm sure.

1056
00:47:49,991 --> 00:47:54,935
My question is, in my experience a lot of times when I failed, I have learned a lot from that experience,

1057
00:47:55,635 --> 00:48:00,760
but I've still had to face the consequences of failure, you know?

1058
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:07,005
And, like, my question is, you know, how do you mitigate that or how do you get past,

1059
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:10,468
how do you process the consequences of those failures, you know?

1060
00:48:10,508 --> 00:48:13,730
Like, spending so much time learning rigging and then...

1061
00:48:15,175 --> 00:48:17,096
not learning any, or learning a lot,

1062
00:48:17,156 --> 00:48:19,118
but not actually getting anywhere to a portfolio,

1063
00:48:19,158 --> 00:48:21,439
and then because you're spending so much time on that,

1064
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:24,201
you're having to learn about portfolio as an example.

1065
00:48:24,341 --> 00:48:30,206
You can talk about that, I guess.

1066
00:48:30,226 --> 00:48:31,707
Well, there's two different kinds of failure

1067
00:48:31,747 --> 00:48:33,008
that you can be experiencing.

1068
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:37,371
There's failure of your ideas and a failure of your...

1069
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:39,163
your project on a large.

1070
00:48:39,183 --> 00:48:40,705
And then there's failures that are localized,

1071
00:48:40,745 --> 00:48:41,405
about tech failures.

1072
00:48:41,626 --> 00:48:43,407
Everybody in this industry hits tech failures.

1073
00:48:43,788 --> 00:48:46,190
The industry changes so fast that there is no way

1074
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:47,672
that you can ever keep up with everything.

1075
00:48:47,792 --> 00:48:50,895
And everybody in this room feels like they're behind.

1076
00:48:51,635 --> 00:48:52,977
So that's nothing new.

1077
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,180
If you're saying, specifically talking

1078
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,822
about the rigging example, if you

1079
00:48:57,842 --> 00:49:00,484
feel like you're failing at rigging, but your game

1080
00:49:02,867 --> 00:49:04,450
is something where you're really excited about something

1081
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:05,471
that has nothing to do with rigging,

1082
00:49:05,892 --> 00:49:07,415
you're kind of getting caught on a tangent there.

1083
00:49:07,976 --> 00:49:09,338
And it's inconsequential to them.

1084
00:49:09,518 --> 00:49:11,101
Like, there are reasons that people go and just

1085
00:49:11,141 --> 00:49:11,782
become animators.

1086
00:49:11,802 --> 00:49:12,663
And that's all they do.

1087
00:49:13,425 --> 00:49:14,887
And I just lost the mic.

1088
00:49:16,209 --> 00:49:16,430
There we go.

1089
00:49:17,782 --> 00:49:19,923
There are reasons that people just focus on being an animator,

1090
00:49:19,943 --> 00:49:21,043
and that's their entire career.

1091
00:49:21,263 --> 00:49:25,365
I mean, I feel like one of the quickest ways to failure

1092
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:27,366
is distributing yourself across too many disciplines.

1093
00:49:27,766 --> 00:49:28,846
And I'm saying that as somebody who

1094
00:49:28,886 --> 00:49:31,547
has distributed themselves across way too many disciplines.

1095
00:49:33,528 --> 00:49:35,428
I suppose you could give a whole other talk about how you should

1096
00:49:35,448 --> 00:49:39,010
focus yourself, how you should start to minimize your risks.

1097
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,010
Like for tower guns.

1098
00:49:40,901 --> 00:49:44,342
I didn't animate those things, even though they were animated, and I didn't hire an animator.

1099
00:49:44,822 --> 00:49:48,783
I just had things spin around in place, or I had things that were like bone rotations to aim,

1100
00:49:48,923 --> 00:49:52,624
or I did the animations in the vertex shader, causing things to like shake like they were an engine.

1101
00:49:52,664 --> 00:49:56,704
I mean, I cheated the animation, and I let that limit define the game.

1102
00:49:57,205 --> 00:50:01,165
And I feel like, as an indie, you can get away with that a little bit better than you could as a AAA.

1103
00:50:01,485 --> 00:50:03,686
I mean, I don't know, it's a hard, it's a hard road.

1104
00:50:06,606 --> 00:50:10,010
Yes, so when you were talking about being in the spiral, Joe,

1105
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:13,935
you mentioned that it was a hard thing to talk about while it

1106
00:50:13,975 --> 00:50:14,475
was happening.

1107
00:50:14,596 --> 00:50:16,378
But in retrospect, you feel confident

1108
00:50:16,398 --> 00:50:17,239
that you can talk about it.

1109
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,724
My question is kind of based around the assumption

1110
00:50:21,744 --> 00:50:23,026
that it's most useful to actually

1111
00:50:23,046 --> 00:50:24,167
be able to talk about these things

1112
00:50:24,227 --> 00:50:25,188
while they're happening, right?

1113
00:50:26,363 --> 00:50:28,185
what did you say to people who are asking, oh, hey,

1114
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:28,725
how's it going?

1115
00:50:28,765 --> 00:50:30,347
Because that's a thing that happens a lot when

1116
00:50:30,367 --> 00:50:31,327
you release a game, right?

1117
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:33,969
Delta developers will be walking up to you and saying,

1118
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:34,790
how's it going?

1119
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:35,551
You know, what are you doing?

1120
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:36,371
What's happening?

1121
00:50:36,511 --> 00:50:38,213
And then what did you actually say to them,

1122
00:50:38,233 --> 00:50:39,254
and how did you actually feel?

1123
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:42,456
It's like that Facebook meme that went around.

1124
00:50:42,516 --> 00:50:44,558
It's like that kid was like, oh, it's the first day of school.

1125
00:50:44,598 --> 00:50:45,158
How's it going?

1126
00:50:45,178 --> 00:50:46,059
I was like, great.

1127
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:46,599
Really?

1128
00:50:49,642 --> 00:50:50,783
Hey, you're working on a game, right?

1129
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:51,083
Yeah.

1130
00:50:51,123 --> 00:50:51,623
How's it going?

1131
00:50:51,703 --> 00:50:51,984
Great.

1132
00:50:52,144 --> 00:50:52,404
Really?

1133
00:50:56,404 --> 00:51:00,067
I mean, for me, I would say that I was still prototyping.

1134
00:51:00,087 --> 00:51:01,948
I would also say I was still supporting tower guns,

1135
00:51:01,968 --> 00:51:03,190
which was true, because I was doing both.

1136
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,812
I was juggling the post-release support of that

1137
00:51:05,892 --> 00:51:07,233
with new prototypes.

1138
00:51:07,353 --> 00:51:11,056
But the further and further along I got,

1139
00:51:11,076 --> 00:51:13,498
because you're talking about a 13-month span here for me,

1140
00:51:14,379 --> 00:51:16,801
the more that didn't fly.

1141
00:51:17,422 --> 00:51:18,763
People were like, they wanted to see something.

1142
00:51:19,533 --> 00:51:20,714
If nothing else, my friends and family

1143
00:51:20,734 --> 00:51:23,976
wanted to see something, let alone the internet at large.

1144
00:51:24,136 --> 00:51:26,999
So it just became harder and harder and harder.

1145
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:30,341
And that was when I began to realize that this tailspin was

1146
00:51:30,381 --> 00:51:30,861
going along.

1147
00:51:30,942 --> 00:51:33,664
And when I was in the middle of this, I knew it was going on.

1148
00:51:33,884 --> 00:51:36,866
And I can't say that I was in denial

1149
00:51:36,886 --> 00:51:37,707
because I knew it was there.

1150
00:51:37,767 --> 00:51:38,787
I just couldn't avoid it.

1151
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:41,990
It's like once you start getting into that habit of not showing

1152
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:46,353
something, that is a self-feeding cycle.

1153
00:51:47,174 --> 00:51:48,695
I don't know if you guys wanted to add in all that.

1154
00:51:50,145 --> 00:52:01,132
I want to say something about that in the last question, which is I think the story you tell yourself is really important, and it becomes hard to answer that question about who you are and what you're doing when people ask you when things aren't going well.

1155
00:52:02,849 --> 00:52:05,270
And then the question about how do you,

1156
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,850
when you have wasted a lot of time, what do you do with that?

1157
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:09,230
I think the answer is to lie to yourself

1158
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:11,371
and just basically retroactively tell yourself

1159
00:52:11,411 --> 00:52:13,091
a really good story about how things are going.

1160
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:14,591
Like, oh yeah, look at that mushroom cloud.

1161
00:52:14,611 --> 00:52:15,332
It's really beautiful.

1162
00:52:15,352 --> 00:52:16,132
Let's check that out.

1163
00:52:16,572 --> 00:52:18,332
You know, like maybe I'm gonna get a cool mutation.

1164
00:52:18,352 --> 00:52:22,393
And I think that, I'm being silly, but I think it's true.

1165
00:52:22,413 --> 00:52:25,193
Like I think that that's how you sort of have to ramp up

1166
00:52:25,233 --> 00:52:27,754
into the future is to keep a positive outlook.

1167
00:52:29,155 --> 00:52:32,679
And so like now the story I tell is yeah, I screwed around for a while. I made Earth Primer

1168
00:52:32,799 --> 00:52:34,721
Let's not talk about everything that happened there

1169
00:52:34,741 --> 00:52:38,485
I learned a bunch of stuff, but like whatever like the story is now this you know

1170
00:52:38,545 --> 00:52:40,427
But this workshop is about telling a different story

1171
00:52:40,705 --> 00:52:46,346
Yeah, this workshop is sort of meant to be a dredge for all that really good work that you did,

1172
00:52:46,366 --> 00:52:51,127
that you hate yourself because of it, to remind you that it was good work at the time,

1173
00:52:51,227 --> 00:52:56,368
and it was valuable work, and it's not just pouring down a hole of infinite blackness, right?

1174
00:52:56,648 --> 00:53:01,549
It's valuable. Bring it to the workshop. Share it with people. Share it with your friends.

1175
00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:04,430
Just share it, you know, if you don't want to get up on stage and talk about it,

1176
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:07,150
share it with the developer next door that you know, that you're friends with.

1177
00:53:07,928 --> 00:53:10,150
And the other thing is, it's a lot easier to talk about it

1178
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,011
and learn from it if you can keep going.

1179
00:53:12,131 --> 00:53:14,854
Or if you've set up your studio or your own situation

1180
00:53:14,914 --> 00:53:17,936
so that a failure of one project doesn't mean that you go

1181
00:53:17,976 --> 00:53:19,297
bankrupt and you have to leave the industry.

1182
00:53:19,337 --> 00:53:22,300
If you actually have some safety margin,

1183
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,701
then it's a lot easier to say to people, hey,

1184
00:53:23,721 --> 00:53:25,462
it's not going great, rather than, hey,

1185
00:53:25,522 --> 00:53:27,504
everything is now in a pit of disaster.

1186
00:53:29,586 --> 00:53:31,527
This is in reference to Tower of Guns.

1187
00:53:33,429 --> 00:53:35,751
I kind of want to know the rest of the story.

1188
00:53:35,771 --> 00:53:40,734
You got to the point, you did a great job of explaining about your family and about

1189
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:45,277
going through all the prototyping and being afraid to show things and all.

1190
00:53:45,297 --> 00:53:48,780
And then you mentioned that now you're working with someone else.

1191
00:53:50,361 --> 00:53:52,262
Was there, what caused that?

1192
00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:55,885
I mean, what, what, what was it that you realized?

1193
00:53:55,985 --> 00:53:58,226
Well, maybe I just can't do this alone.

1194
00:53:58,286 --> 00:53:59,427
I need someone else.

1195
00:53:59,447 --> 00:54:01,008
Or was it something else completely?

1196
00:54:01,388 --> 00:54:03,374
Well, OK, I have to be a little bit vague here

1197
00:54:03,414 --> 00:54:06,121
because of contracts and legal reasons.

1198
00:54:08,212 --> 00:54:13,596
I had had, let's say, an opportunity that was like a year out while I was working on these prototypes,

1199
00:54:13,616 --> 00:54:17,058
and I kind of knew it was there in the background, so it was almost like a safety net, this next project.

1200
00:54:17,138 --> 00:54:19,740
And I kind of kept on working on my prototypes, being like,

1201
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,963
well, maybe I still want to do my own thing, but this other opportunity was always there.

1202
00:54:24,224 --> 00:54:27,906
And it was kind of a fellow dev reaching out and being like,

1203
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:29,928
we liked working with you, let's keep working together.

1204
00:54:32,857 --> 00:54:35,158
That kind of situation, I was a little wary of

1205
00:54:35,218 --> 00:54:36,939
because I had come, the studio I was working at

1206
00:54:36,959 --> 00:54:38,579
before I went indie was 38 Studios,

1207
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:42,081
which had a very catastrophic bankruptcy.

1208
00:54:42,101 --> 00:54:42,902
It was in the press.

1209
00:54:42,942 --> 00:54:44,302
It still is in the press in New England.

1210
00:54:44,342 --> 00:54:46,523
If you're from New England, then you see it show up

1211
00:54:46,543 --> 00:54:47,324
in the news every so often,

1212
00:54:47,344 --> 00:54:49,345
because there was FBI investigations and stuff,

1213
00:54:49,385 --> 00:54:51,866
and a $70 million loan from Rhode Island.

1214
00:54:51,886 --> 00:54:52,646
It was really crazy.

1215
00:54:53,147 --> 00:54:54,447
I was just an artist on that team.

1216
00:54:54,487 --> 00:54:55,588
I had nothing to do with any of that.

1217
00:54:57,605 --> 00:55:01,706
I was just like, whoa, why are there 30 news crews at the

1218
00:55:01,746 --> 00:55:06,547
office today? It was pretty amazing. But it was also, I was

1219
00:55:06,587 --> 00:55:09,428
like, kind of wary of being like, okay, let's go back and

1220
00:55:09,448 --> 00:55:12,169
work with a large team again. I kind of was enjoying the idea of

1221
00:55:12,669 --> 00:55:16,030
working in my pajamas from home, seeing my wife a lot more than I

1222
00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:19,211
would when I was crunching at a game dev, at a AAA game dev.

1223
00:55:20,724 --> 00:55:23,987
And I was kind of worried about the idea of taking on teammates

1224
00:55:24,027 --> 00:55:28,371
because in my mind, you couldn't do something that was crazy.

1225
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:30,793
I wanted to do something really batshit crazy.

1226
00:55:31,914 --> 00:55:35,198
And I didn't feel like there would be.

1227
00:55:35,558 --> 00:55:38,160
I felt like, in my mind, the more teammates you acquired,

1228
00:55:38,661 --> 00:55:40,423
the more you had responsibility to them

1229
00:55:40,563 --> 00:55:41,744
to make sure they could feed their family.

1230
00:55:43,156 --> 00:55:46,919
I didn't realize that there could be other developers who were totally on board with making something crazy.

1231
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:52,282
And so the partners that I'm working with now, I've worked with before and I know I work with them well

1232
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:56,305
and we're building something that's crazy. So, yeah.

1233
00:55:59,250 --> 00:55:59,410
Cool.

1234
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:03,071
Hey, so one of the things that I do is I work with,

1235
00:56:03,292 --> 00:56:05,712
I'm a program assistant at a two-year program that's

1236
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:09,033
really project-based and quick-paced for our students.

1237
00:56:09,373 --> 00:56:11,214
And there's really no safer place

1238
00:56:11,254 --> 00:56:13,875
to fail than in your educational institution.

1239
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:16,315
But I talk to so many students who

1240
00:56:16,375 --> 00:56:18,276
are scared to share their ideas or scared

1241
00:56:18,316 --> 00:56:20,537
to dive into their dream project because they're

1242
00:56:20,557 --> 00:56:21,417
scared they're going to fail.

1243
00:56:21,877 --> 00:56:24,738
Do you have any tips for students or any of us

1244
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,419
who are hesitant to jump into a project because

1245
00:56:27,459 --> 00:56:28,459
of the fear of failure?

1246
00:56:29,474 --> 00:56:31,594
It's endemic to our society.

1247
00:56:31,734 --> 00:56:34,695
We systematically educate people out of creativity

1248
00:56:34,755 --> 00:56:37,435
by saying that the worst possible thing you can be

1249
00:56:37,515 --> 00:56:37,895
is wrong.

1250
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:41,456
So that may be too large for the scope of a question

1251
00:56:41,476 --> 00:56:42,196
and answer session.

1252
00:56:42,256 --> 00:56:43,556
But I don't know.

1253
00:56:43,576 --> 00:56:46,577
I think you kind of have to actively fight

1254
00:56:46,617 --> 00:56:50,938
against this instinct to be afraid of the failure.

1255
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:53,158
It's the blank page, right?

1256
00:56:53,198 --> 00:56:53,439
Yeah.

1257
00:56:53,859 --> 00:56:56,019
Well, I feel like I'm hogging the mic.

1258
00:56:57,141 --> 00:57:03,305
So, the best thing that has come out of game culture in the last 10 years has been game jams.

1259
00:57:03,705 --> 00:57:08,168
Game jams, there's no obligation to make something good. Nobody's expecting anything good.

1260
00:57:08,588 --> 00:57:11,290
The deadline for them comes and goes within days or hours.

1261
00:57:12,838 --> 00:57:15,380
I feel like if you're in an educational environment,

1262
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,582
and if you're in an educational environment,

1263
00:57:17,022 --> 00:57:18,323
you should really be pushing your students

1264
00:57:18,363 --> 00:57:19,925
to enter every game jam there is out there

1265
00:57:19,965 --> 00:57:21,807
because that's how you fail quickly.

1266
00:57:22,227 --> 00:57:24,970
And you can put stuff behind you as fast as possible.

1267
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:28,774
And I feel like that, the game jam culture is amazing.

1268
00:57:28,894 --> 00:57:31,016
And it's making some really, really strong designers

1269
00:57:31,416 --> 00:57:33,178
just because they're getting through that pile of paper

1270
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:34,680
of bad designs really quick.

1271
00:57:36,488 --> 00:57:40,572
I think also for us, there's a group of game developers

1272
00:57:40,592 --> 00:57:42,734
around where we're based, and we talk a lot.

1273
00:57:42,814 --> 00:57:44,115
I'm sure a lot of people here have that.

1274
00:57:44,495 --> 00:57:46,477
So I guess with students, one of the things that

1275
00:57:46,517 --> 00:57:48,439
could happen is to create that environment where.

1276
00:57:48,758 --> 00:57:51,101
They're happy to share with each other everything

1277
00:57:51,121 --> 00:57:51,682
that they're doing.

1278
00:57:51,822 --> 00:57:54,384
And then if you see someone else who's not having a good time,

1279
00:57:54,404 --> 00:57:56,046
you don't feel so bad yourself.

1280
00:57:56,166 --> 00:58:00,611
I think trying to get that idea into students early on,

1281
00:58:00,891 --> 00:58:02,973
that it's about that community where

1282
00:58:03,013 --> 00:58:06,457
it is acceptable to talk through some of the ideas that

1283
00:58:06,497 --> 00:58:08,399
aren't working, it is really good,

1284
00:58:08,439 --> 00:58:10,181
because that's something that professionally absolutely

1285
00:58:10,221 --> 00:58:10,961
everyone needs that.

1286
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:20,936
So one of the things I did when I stopped working on the Pocket Kingdom project was I went back to school and started doing a PhD.

1287
00:58:21,516 --> 00:58:27,959
And I taught an undergraduate studio class. One of the things I did in that class was every week the students had to do a whole new prototype.

1288
00:58:28,419 --> 00:58:31,861
And every week they also had to do a whole one-page design document.

1289
00:58:32,381 --> 00:58:36,544
as well, and it was all about just make a bunch of stuff,

1290
00:58:36,784 --> 00:58:38,485
and it's okay if it's not good.

1291
00:58:39,026 --> 00:58:41,827
And part of the point of doing it on a one-week cycle

1292
00:58:42,348 --> 00:58:43,969
is that you just, it's like you're filling up

1293
00:58:44,009 --> 00:58:45,610
that stack of paper, you know?

1294
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:47,191
And you're learning, you're calibrating

1295
00:58:47,211 --> 00:58:49,392
your own sense of scope and focus.

1296
00:58:50,373 --> 00:58:53,354
But it was still a tension because students still want to get good grades in classes.

1297
00:58:53,454 --> 00:58:56,636
You know, like, if you tell them it's okay to, like, I want you to take a risk, I would

1298
00:58:56,656 --> 00:59:00,837
encourage them to take a risk, but they still are worried about, there's still that structure

1299
00:59:00,877 --> 00:59:03,999
of the class that, I mean, I didn't, it's still like, there's still that paradox there,

1300
00:59:04,019 --> 00:59:06,940
but I think you can push in that direction.

1301
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,541
I think also improv has a bunch of good...

1302
00:59:09,252 --> 00:59:10,633
If you look there, you'll find good stuff.

1303
00:59:10,934 --> 00:59:14,256
There's a lot of like, you fail an improv and you take a bow.

1304
00:59:15,237 --> 00:59:16,878
It's all about you celebrate your failures.

1305
00:59:17,499 --> 00:59:19,620
And it's a lot about just cultivating

1306
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:22,302
a sense of acceptance so that just all kinds of crazy stuff

1307
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:24,404
has a place to kind of come up and be there.

1308
00:59:24,484 --> 00:59:26,045
And then you can move on and do another scene.

1309
00:59:27,025 --> 00:59:33,027
However you feel about Jim Carrey, there's a great story about him as he was trying to learn how to do stand-up before he became famous at all.

1310
00:59:33,067 --> 00:59:39,209
And just some nights he'd be bombing so hard, and on those nights what he would do is just lie on the ground, roll off the stage,

1311
00:59:39,249 --> 00:59:42,651
and then just pretend to be a cockroach and try and wedge himself as far as possible onto the stage.

1312
00:59:42,671 --> 00:59:44,291
And he would do that for like three minutes.

1313
00:59:45,772 --> 00:59:49,153
And he'd do it until he got a laugh, and then he would stop.

1314
00:59:49,473 --> 00:59:50,254
Even like a pity laugh.

1315
00:59:51,434 --> 00:59:55,379
cool. Yeah. Excellent. I think that's going to wrap it up for the failure workshop unless

1316
00:59:55,399 --> 00:59:59,904
anybody had any like really burning closing comments. Yeah, I'm sorry. We have to wrap

1317
00:59:59,964 --> 01:00:01,446
up because we're at time now. So.

1318
01:00:01,486 --> 01:00:02,167
There's the wrap up room too.

1319
01:00:02,187 --> 01:00:04,329
Yes, there is. Yeah. Yeah. Huge round of applause for these guys. Thank you gentlemen for having

1320
01:00:04,349 --> 01:00:05,771
the courage to share your failures with everybody.

1321
01:00:05,791 --> 01:00:05,991
Thank you.

1322
01:00:06,011 --> 01:00:06,211
Thank you.

1323
01:00:06,231 --> 01:00:06,672
Thank you.

1324
01:00:06,692 --> 01:00:06,892
Thank you.

1325
01:00:06,912 --> 01:00:07,092
Thank you.

1326
01:00:07,112 --> 01:00:07,313
Thank you.

1327
01:00:07,333 --> 01:00:07,573
Thank you.

1328
01:00:07,593 --> 01:00:07,793
Thank you.

1329
01:00:07,813 --> 01:00:08,033
Thank you.

1330
01:00:08,053 --> 01:00:08,294
Thank you.

1331
01:00:08,314 --> 01:00:08,494
Thank you.

1332
01:00:08,514 --> 01:00:08,694
Thank you.

1333
01:00:08,714 --> 01:00:08,934
Thank you.

1334
01:00:08,955 --> 01:00:09,195
Thank you.

1335
01:00:09,215 --> 01:00:09,435
Thank you.

1336
01:00:09,455 --> 01:00:09,635
Thank you.
