00:00:06,611 --> 00:00:08,012
Hi, welcome to GDC.

2
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:10,793
This is my talk, 30-minute Steam page makeovers,

3
00:00:11,293 --> 00:00:12,354
how to make a page that wows.

4
00:00:12,634 --> 00:00:13,534
I'm Chris Zukoski.

5
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:14,435
Thanks for being here.

6
00:00:14,775 --> 00:00:17,596
One of my favorite things are these home makeover shows,

7
00:00:17,616 --> 00:00:18,857
you know, where they start with an ugly house

8
00:00:18,897 --> 00:00:20,257
and then they make it look good.

9
00:00:20,817 --> 00:00:23,619
And I just always was so inspired by them.

10
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:25,840
And I wanted to try something similar to that today.

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,101
For some reason, they always have to be leaning

12
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:30,202
on something, some sort of ladder or something.

13
00:00:30,342 --> 00:00:32,623
You gotta lean a lot if you're in construction, I guess.

14
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:33,163
I don't know.

15
00:00:33,523 --> 00:00:35,744
But my favorite part is when they do the before and after.

16
00:00:35,784 --> 00:00:37,544
They have like this really bad looking picture

17
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:39,405
and then they make it look pretty at the end of the show.

18
00:00:39,425 --> 00:00:41,166
I wanna do that.

19
00:00:41,266 --> 00:00:44,407
I'm basically the Bob Vila of Steam Pages.

20
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:49,168
I'm a consultant and I help developers and indies

21
00:00:49,228 --> 00:00:52,049
and studios, big companies, small companies, publishers,

22
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,610
make their Steam Pages work for them.

23
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,051
I make pages that, wow.

24
00:00:57,411 --> 00:00:57,531
So,

25
00:00:58,432 --> 00:01:01,113
What I want to talk to you about this is everything that I've learned.

26
00:01:01,273 --> 00:01:05,095
So I write a weekly blog at howtomarketagame.com, that's where I live,

27
00:01:05,736 --> 00:01:11,599
and I kind of learn the ins and outs of Steam pages and kind of publish my results on this

28
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:15,501
other class that's totally free called howtomakeasteampage.com.

29
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:19,483
So between those two, I've kind of learned a lot about Steam.

30
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:20,323
So

31
00:01:21,587 --> 00:01:25,531
What I wanted to do was take everything that I learned from the last GDC talk that I gave.

32
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:29,134
My last one last year was called Empathizing with Steam, how buyers see your game.

33
00:01:29,474 --> 00:01:34,378
I gave a lot of information, but it's not as many like how-to facts for how to make your page better.

34
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:37,501
This year, it's all going to be about how to make your page better.

35
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:40,844
So let's dive in. Now, this is going to apply to first-time devs.

36
00:01:41,104 --> 00:01:41,344
If you've...

37
00:01:41,905 --> 00:01:43,946
still haven't made your page, maybe your page is super early.

38
00:01:43,966 --> 00:01:47,849
Also, it's going to apply to devs who have been around.

39
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:49,069
They've created multiple games.

40
00:01:49,129 --> 00:01:52,291
Maybe you've got a new one in the works, so you can learn something from this.

41
00:01:52,732 --> 00:01:56,134
And it's also going to apply if maybe you released a game several years ago

42
00:01:56,174 --> 00:01:59,436
and just haven't updated in a while and you kind of moved on with your life.

43
00:02:00,276 --> 00:02:01,917
But that Steam page still exists.

44
00:02:02,178 --> 00:02:04,179
Steam's actually pretty good at promoting old games.

45
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,302
So this might help kind of sweep away the cobwebs and update your old game.

46
00:02:09,642 --> 00:02:10,243
I'm going to show you how.

47
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,872
So, these are going to be real-world examples.

48
00:02:14,452 --> 00:02:17,294
I've gotten permission from the devs that I'm going to show.

49
00:02:17,735 --> 00:02:19,136
Some of these are my actual clients.

50
00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:21,929
Some of these are folks who've just shared their numbers with me.

51
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:24,231
They said, Oh, I took a class and I learned something here.

52
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:24,652
Look at this.

53
00:02:25,052 --> 00:02:27,954
So I'm going to tell you when that happens, but there are going to be times

54
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:31,998
when I show the before and after, and I just want to be clear that I'm, you

55
00:02:32,038 --> 00:02:36,561
know, these pages are a work in progress always, so it's not that they were bad

56
00:02:36,602 --> 00:02:40,565
or lazy devs or anything, if the page didn't look great at the beginning, it's

57
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:42,446
really that pages should be.

58
00:02:42,727 --> 00:02:44,368
posted live as soon as you're ready.

59
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:46,069
Don't wait too long.

60
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:50,471
Don't pine and work so hard to make it absolutely perfect.

61
00:02:50,912 --> 00:02:53,113
I commend the devs who just put their page up,

62
00:02:53,593 --> 00:02:55,574
get started, make their page live.

63
00:02:55,835 --> 00:02:57,195
That's the way you should be doing it.

64
00:02:57,736 --> 00:03:00,637
So don't feel bad if your page doesn't meet up

65
00:03:00,678 --> 00:03:01,738
to the standards that I have.

66
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:04,040
This is all we're all in this to learn together.

67
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,180
And I'm going to show you how to make it good.

68
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,102
It's good to be fast and upload what you got now,

69
00:03:08,882 --> 00:03:10,243
waiting for it to be perfect.

70
00:03:10,303 --> 00:03:11,884
Because the longer you wait.

71
00:03:12,605 --> 00:03:14,186
the fewer wish lists you're going to get.

72
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:15,026
Okay?

73
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:19,089
So the most common problems of Steam pages

74
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:21,331
that I see that come across my desk are these.

75
00:03:21,631 --> 00:03:23,312
I've got, this whole talk's going to be broken down

76
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:24,733
in these four main problems.

77
00:03:25,113 --> 00:03:27,135
The first one is your page just doesn't stand out.

78
00:03:27,755 --> 00:03:29,977
It's unclear what genre you have.

79
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,939
Number three is not working within the Steam algorithm

80
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:33,959
to support your game.

81
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,841
And then finally, your game looks dead

82
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:39,843
or it looks like the Steam page is no longer being updated.

83
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:41,844
the dreaded dead game.

84
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:44,565
So I'm going to show you how to fix all four of these problems

85
00:03:44,585 --> 00:03:45,765
with real-world examples.

86
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:47,166
So let's get started here.

87
00:03:47,786 --> 00:03:49,127
So let's tackle the first problem,

88
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:51,788
which is your page just doesn't stand out.

89
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:56,169
The thing is, Steam, there's a lot of games on there.

90
00:03:56,449 --> 00:03:59,450
And a lot of them are what we call shovelware or asset flips.

91
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:02,471
They're people who maybe are just doing this for a hobby,

92
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:03,632
or this is their first game,

93
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,873
or maybe they're just quickly trying to flip a game

94
00:04:05,893 --> 00:04:07,973
that they downloaded off the Unity Asset Store.

95
00:04:08,494 --> 00:04:11,435
Now, Steam shoppers are used to these games.

96
00:04:11,895 --> 00:04:16,678
They've got a highly tuned sense of what looks like shovelware and what is a flip game.

97
00:04:17,138 --> 00:04:21,801
You want to make sure that you prove to these Steam shoppers that that is not your game.

98
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:22,761
You rise above.

99
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:24,102
You are not just an asset flip.

100
00:04:24,422 --> 00:04:29,045
So I'm going to show you how to rise above and make sure that your page signals that

101
00:04:29,065 --> 00:04:31,006
it's a high quality, well-produced game.

102
00:04:32,174 --> 00:04:34,376
So here's an example of a before picture.

103
00:04:34,636 --> 00:04:37,699
This is this game, Jupiter Moons Mecca, great developer,

104
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:39,660
but this is one of their first versions

105
00:04:39,741 --> 00:04:40,801
right out of the gate of the page.

106
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:43,124
Again, there's some problems here, but it's okay.

107
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:44,845
All developers start out somewhere.

108
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,847
So one of the first things I noticed

109
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:47,968
when I first see this page

110
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:51,571
is a lot of the screenshots are very similar.

111
00:04:51,872 --> 00:04:55,095
You'll notice, see how they're green backdrops, same city.

112
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,217
Two of the screenshots have the same mech

113
00:04:57,377 --> 00:04:58,117
that they're battling.

114
00:04:58,738 --> 00:05:00,200
on right against it.

115
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:03,405
So these kind of lack of asset difference

116
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:05,327
between your screenshots are all very similar,

117
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,330
similar color, similar orientation,

118
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:11,296
starts to clue people in, maybe this is an asset flip.

119
00:05:11,796 --> 00:05:13,118
And the reason that is, is because

120
00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:16,240
Usually on the Unity Asset Store, you get one asset.

121
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,161
This is, I just pulled this random one off the Asset Store,

122
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:19,881
Hot Lava.

123
00:05:20,342 --> 00:05:23,783
So a lot of first-time devs will use their one asset

124
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:25,023
in several screenshots.

125
00:05:25,804 --> 00:05:28,405
And sometimes the whole game is just this one asset

126
00:05:28,445 --> 00:05:29,005
that they got.

127
00:05:29,545 --> 00:05:31,166
So if you have several screenshots

128
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,726
that are all of this Lava asset,

129
00:05:33,187 --> 00:05:35,227
that signals to Steam shoppers,

130
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:36,748
oh, this is probably just an asset flip.

131
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:38,669
They bought that one Hot Lava asset

132
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:40,309
and the whole game is set in this one world.

133
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,871
You don't want to do that. Steam players like deep gameplay.

134
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,392
So to fix this problem, there's three things.

135
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,193
You got to show unique screenshots,

136
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,274
you have to have a really good capsule,

137
00:05:50,675 --> 00:05:53,436
and your game assets should be throughout your page.

138
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:55,977
So it looks like it's high-res art.

139
00:05:56,377 --> 00:05:59,059
Okay? Now, unique screenshots.

140
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:00,339
Here's how we do it.

141
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,200
We're going to show a variety of environments,

142
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,001
a variety of visual effects,

143
00:06:04,261 --> 00:06:05,842
and we're going to show in-game menus.

144
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:06,963
Yes, we're going to show UI.

145
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:10,934
Now, it's better to have fewer screenshots that are unique

146
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:13,896
than I have a whole bunch that are very similar.

147
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:16,379
So this is the after effect,

148
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:18,561
after we've kind of updated the screenshots

149
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:20,102
with these unique artwork.

150
00:06:20,522 --> 00:06:23,305
So before, you can see that they were similar,

151
00:06:23,405 --> 00:06:25,827
three green backdrops, same background,

152
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:28,229
two of the images had the same opponent on there.

153
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,951
Afterwards, the dev did a great job.

154
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,140
switching up the variety.

155
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,021
You'll notice each backdrop is different.

156
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,882
Different mechs in each one.

157
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,384
And the third screenshot is actually UI.

158
00:06:40,004 --> 00:06:42,025
Now I'm going to show you when I look in on this UI.

159
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:43,706
Let's take a look here.

160
00:06:43,726 --> 00:06:44,927
I love including UI.

161
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:46,288
I know it sounds boring.

162
00:06:46,348 --> 00:06:47,148
It's not exciting.

163
00:06:47,188 --> 00:06:48,849
It's not like got that wow effect.

164
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:52,131
But it signals to Steam shoppers

165
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,391
that your game has depth.

166
00:06:53,772 --> 00:06:57,175
And that's the thing that asset flips lack is that gameplay depth.

167
00:06:57,615 --> 00:07:00,578
When I look at this complex inventory screenshot,

168
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:03,981
I don't quite know what's going on, but I can tell that there's something here.

169
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,845
I see a bunch of hit points, lots of stats, lots of elements

170
00:07:08,085 --> 00:07:09,967
all over the place, grids everywhere.

171
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,851
This screenshot tells shoppers this is a deep game.

172
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:15,372
You can sink your teeth into this.

173
00:07:16,614 --> 00:07:20,739
Okay, the next way to kind of fix this low-res game,

174
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:22,861
kind of like asset flip game, how to rise above,

175
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:24,362
is better capsules.

176
00:07:25,283 --> 00:07:28,127
A capsule is Steam's language for this little image

177
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:29,989
in the top right box of every game.

178
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:32,191
Here it is, Half-Life Alyx.

179
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:32,952
Put a little arrow.

180
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:35,314
That's a capsule, that image of Half-Life Alyx.

181
00:07:36,035 --> 00:07:39,077
Now, I'm going to show you before, this is a game called Dwarven Valley.

182
00:07:39,437 --> 00:07:40,638
This is their first capsule.

183
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:42,500
It's a screenshot of the game.

184
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,383
Now, Dwarven Castle, or Dwarven Valley, is a building game.

185
00:07:47,443 --> 00:07:50,966
You kind of craft items for the villagers, and you build your workshop out.

186
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:53,768
This capsule includes a screenshot of the game.

187
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:56,430
So it's a very beautiful game. I think this is a beautiful game.

188
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,394
But, just using the screenshot in the capsule is problematic,

189
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,495
and I'm going to show you why.

190
00:08:03,665 --> 00:08:08,689
Now, when you just use a screenshot, that signals to Steam you don't have an ARC budget.

191
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,991
Even if your game is totally beautiful.

192
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:14,314
So I recommend you hire a professional illustrator.

193
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:19,419
Because no asset flipper is ever going to hire a professional illustrator for their game.

194
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:20,960
They're just going to grab a screenshot.

195
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,021
It's cheap. It's easy.

196
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,984
You've got to rise above and show that you've got some complexity here,

197
00:08:25,244 --> 00:08:26,985
and that you can afford this sort of thing.

198
00:08:27,486 --> 00:08:29,187
So don't use screenshots for your capsule.

199
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:32,291
And also, if you have a pixel art game,

200
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:35,917
I'm going to recommend against using pixel art in your capsule.

201
00:08:35,977 --> 00:08:36,838
And I'll show you why.

202
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:39,462
Basically, your goal here is to signal,

203
00:08:40,063 --> 00:08:41,525
I am investing money in this game.

204
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:44,108
I have spent and hired people that can help me.

205
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:46,953
I'm not just using this as a quick asset flip.

206
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,394
Now, Pixel Art games. I love Pixel Art. I've made Pixel Art games.

207
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:56,600
However, in the Steam community, they have a bad reputation of being cheap games.

208
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,264
I don't think all Pixel Art games are cheap. I just know that in the past...

209
00:09:01,236 --> 00:09:05,199
Pixel art games have been cheap and that's left a bad taste in a lot of

210
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:06,239
Steam shoppers minds.

211
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:12,964
So what, um, to stand above a lot of these top tier pixel art games use an

212
00:09:13,044 --> 00:09:17,067
illustrated capsule. Look at this Celeste, neon abyss, even Baba is you.

213
00:09:17,127 --> 00:09:21,010
It's a very simple drawn capsule, but you'll notice it's actually illustrated.

214
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,292
It's not pixel art. So to rise above, if you have a pixel art game,

215
00:09:25,873 --> 00:09:29,315
you really should invest in a fully illustrated cover.

216
00:09:30,392 --> 00:09:33,333
Now, here we've got our capsules after.

217
00:09:33,413 --> 00:09:38,936
So the developer went back and went and had a great, well-illustrated capsule.

218
00:09:39,436 --> 00:09:40,877
Now you'll notice it's got this dwarf.

219
00:09:41,217 --> 00:09:42,818
He actually renamed the game to Kingdom Workshop.

220
00:09:42,878 --> 00:09:44,198
I swear this is the same game.

221
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,920
And what he did when he changed it out is this character is fully illustrated.

222
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,301
It's not a model from the game.

223
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:54,783
And he actually added some great new title art to it, Kingdom Workshop.

224
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:59,194
And after implementing this capsule, you'll see this increase.

225
00:09:59,274 --> 00:10:02,715
Look at that new capsule, a huge spike right after that capsule.

226
00:10:03,215 --> 00:10:06,575
Immediately, he could see the results of implementing this new capsule.

227
00:10:07,076 --> 00:10:07,836
And it's great.

228
00:10:09,076 --> 00:10:11,597
Using a capsule that's professionally illustrated

229
00:10:11,697 --> 00:10:12,457
is worth the money.

230
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:15,538
I find that a capsule will typically cost you about $500 to $1,000 USD.

231
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:22,100
And that's expensive. I know it is. That's a lot of money.

232
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,522
But it is worth it. It signals that you are investing in your game.

233
00:10:27,243 --> 00:10:30,664
If this is a business for you, you should invest in this. It's some of the best

234
00:10:30,784 --> 00:10:35,407
money spent. So run bake sales, mow lawns, if you have

235
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:38,848
trouble affording this, whatever you can do, try and

236
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:42,690
figure out how to get a well illustrated professional artist to do

237
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,211
your capsule. It's worth the money.

238
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:47,536
The interesting thing is you'll note that even the capsule for Kingdom Workshop

239
00:10:47,917 --> 00:10:51,843
isn't a screenshot from the game. It tells you actually less than the screenshot,

240
00:10:52,324 --> 00:10:57,272
but just by including that illustrated capsule, it just elevates the game to a new level.

241
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:01,330
Finally, to make your game look expensive, as I say,

242
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:05,073
you should have game assets throughout your page.

243
00:11:05,394 --> 00:11:06,275
Let me show you what I mean.

244
00:11:07,456 --> 00:11:08,557
Show, don't tell.

245
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:10,399
Don't have a lot of text to explain your game.

246
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,761
You want to prove that you have the artist's chops

247
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:16,205
to really decorate your Steam page in a nice, engaging way.

248
00:11:16,745 --> 00:11:17,606
Let me show you what I mean.

249
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:21,590
This is a game that I consulted for called Whisker Squadron.

250
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,499
And you'll notice there's a section at the bottom called About This Game.

251
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,522
Now, in the past, old Steam, people used to just fill this with text.

252
00:11:29,603 --> 00:11:30,563
It's totally logical.

253
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:32,205
That's kind of what Steam hints that you should do.

254
00:11:32,945 --> 00:11:35,187
But it's kind of too much text.

255
00:11:35,267 --> 00:11:37,209
Most Steam shoppers don't don't read that much.

256
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:42,313
So what the developer did was went back, pulled gifs of their game.

257
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:45,535
Now, this game is a very beautiful game.

258
00:11:45,795 --> 00:11:47,757
Well animated, sharp art.

259
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:50,219
It's like a spiritual successor to Star Fox.

260
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,505
And you can just see it just by looking at these animated GIFs that are just rotating.

261
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:58,711
You say, ah, that looks just like Star Fox. It's so great. It's a spiritual successor.

262
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:02,176
This is so much more impactful than just text describing it.

263
00:12:02,496 --> 00:12:07,023
And so you need to show how vibrant your game is by doing these animated GIFs.

264
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:11,292
Another great page is this Return to Nangrim.

265
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:13,254
This page is beautiful.

266
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:17,700
You'll notice that the whole game, the capsule, the screenshots, the announcements, even these

267
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,483
little embellishments all over, have the same color palette.

268
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:23,307
It shows how well art directed this game is.

269
00:12:23,427 --> 00:12:25,510
It just subtly feels like an expensive game.

270
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:27,111
It almost feels not like Steam.

271
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:33,578
Some of the touches that they've added are these little filibri, this little tiny linework that

272
00:12:33,598 --> 00:12:38,022
just looks so cool. It looks like the game is emerging into Steam. These sort of like

273
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:44,508
just enhancements that must have cost an artist hundreds of hours to create this stuff. It just

274
00:12:44,528 --> 00:12:49,092
looks so good, like you've invested in your game. Again, you're making yourself look impressive.

275
00:12:49,813 --> 00:12:55,017
So to make your game and your Steam page look expensive, like you've invested in this game,

276
00:12:55,418 --> 00:12:59,141
you need to show a variety of screenshots, you got to show some illustrated capsules,

277
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:04,705
and you got to pack your Steam page with graphical assets that just show that you've got great art.

278
00:13:05,966 --> 00:13:10,971
Okay, let's move on to the next problem I see with a lot of Steam pages, an unclear genre.

279
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:13,398
What do you do in this game?

280
00:13:13,438 --> 00:13:15,840
That's a common problem that shoppers have

281
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,640
when they come to your page,

282
00:13:17,121 --> 00:13:19,503
and a lot of first-time devs just have a problem

283
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:20,624
getting this into their Steam page.

284
00:13:20,844 --> 00:13:21,925
So I'm gonna show you how to do this.

285
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:26,120
Okay, Steam audience knows their genres.

286
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,182
I know we're developers and we're omnivorous,

287
00:13:28,222 --> 00:13:29,724
we're excited to try any game,

288
00:13:30,024 --> 00:13:32,867
but most typical gamers are very specific

289
00:13:32,907 --> 00:13:34,388
in the games they like and they don't like.

290
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:35,710
When I was doing my study,

291
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,611
I got a lot of quotes from people saying,

292
00:13:38,052 --> 00:13:39,373
oh, this looks like Mario Party.

293
00:13:39,513 --> 00:13:40,314
No, thank you.

294
00:13:40,394 --> 00:13:41,235
Like immediately,

295
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:42,576
they didn't even have to consider the game.

296
00:13:42,837 --> 00:13:44,859
They knew that this game was like a party game

297
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:47,021
and they didn't like party games, so they moved on.

298
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:49,825
These type of quotes are common among steam.

299
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:53,630
Shoppers know their genre and most will move on if it's not your genre.

300
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,776
Which sounds bad, but they're excited when it actually is the genre they like.

301
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:01,741
So you need to be very clear with your genre.

302
00:14:01,761 --> 00:14:02,282
Let me show you.

303
00:14:03,636 --> 00:14:07,719
This is a description, this is the short description, which is the text right under the capsule.

304
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,621
This is for a game, I hid the name because I don't like to speak bad about a game,

305
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:16,504
but I think that this description could be improved. So let me show you what I mean.

306
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:22,067
The year is 1983. The world teeters on the verge of destruction as the cold water tightens its icy

307
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:26,330
grip. East or west, trust no one, question everything. The fate of humanity rests in

308
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,511
your hands as you pit spy versus spy.

309
00:14:29,092 --> 00:14:32,933
Now, this description is very evocative, but I don't know the genre.

310
00:14:33,093 --> 00:14:33,833
Do you know the genre?

311
00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:38,135
I didn't include pictures because I didn't want to hint at what it was, but if you think

312
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:42,876
about it, this could be an FPS, it could be a visual novel, it could be an RPG, it could

313
00:14:42,896 --> 00:14:47,598
be a tactical strategy game, a real-time strategy game, any of those genres.

314
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:48,878
This could be anywhere.

315
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:53,100
They're basically describing the surface coat and not the actual gameplay.

316
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,041
This is a problem because it's hard to determine what the genre of this game is.

317
00:14:58,311 --> 00:14:59,672
So here's how we're going to fix this.

318
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:01,815
We're going to write better short descriptions.

319
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:04,637
We'll also fix this by showing better screenshots that

320
00:15:04,758 --> 00:15:05,819
hint towards the genre.

321
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:09,583
And we're going to be very trope conscious in our capsules

322
00:15:09,603 --> 00:15:12,325
because the capsules will hint as to what type of game this is.

323
00:15:12,986 --> 00:15:13,807
So let's take a look here.

324
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:19,908
A lot of short descriptions describe the feeling, the emotions, what the graphics look like.

325
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:24,454
Which is kind of a mistake because right to the side of the short descriptions are pictures.

326
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:28,359
This is from a great looking game called Blair Witch Project.

327
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,100
And you'll notice

328
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:31,702
They don't have to write that this is a spooky game.

329
00:15:31,823 --> 00:15:32,763
You just look at the screenshots.

330
00:15:32,783 --> 00:15:34,185
You're like, this is a spooky game.

331
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,107
This is a horror-based in the woods game.

332
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:39,089
So they can eliminate all those words from their description.

333
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,511
They can focus on gameplay.

334
00:15:40,931 --> 00:15:43,534
So let your screenshots and your trailer

335
00:15:44,074 --> 00:15:48,298
use to describe the mood and kind of the feeling of the game.

336
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:50,280
Don't waste words describing feeling.

337
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,541
Screenshots will do that.

338
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:56,639
Instead, I like to make my short descriptions verb-focused.

339
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,381
Write down what you literally do in the game.

340
00:15:59,441 --> 00:16:00,602
What verbs do you use?

341
00:16:00,942 --> 00:16:03,725
Some helpful hints for writing your short description.

342
00:16:04,045 --> 00:16:06,347
These are kind of thought experiments I like to do.

343
00:16:06,827 --> 00:16:08,789
Say, write down all the verbs that happen

344
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,170
when you push each of the face buttons

345
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,831
if you were using a controller on this game.

346
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:12,772
What are those verbs?

347
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:15,033
Those verbs should appear in your short description.

348
00:16:15,654 --> 00:16:17,155
What happens if you die in the game?

349
00:16:17,596 --> 00:16:17,896
Do you...

350
00:16:19,837 --> 00:16:22,359
Do you die forever? Does the world reset?

351
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,860
What happens when you die?

352
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,901
That can really hint at the genre.

353
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:27,803
Is it a roguelike where the world resets?

354
00:16:28,343 --> 00:16:29,944
Maybe. That really hints to it.

355
00:16:30,424 --> 00:16:31,865
Also describe how time works.

356
00:16:32,185 --> 00:16:33,967
Is it real time? Is it turn-based?

357
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:35,388
Is there a real world clock?

358
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,029
What is it? Is it like Animal Crossing where

359
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,091
whatever day it is today is the time in Animal Crossing?

360
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:42,953
All those things help hint to your genre.

361
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:45,034
So describe these things in your short description.

362
00:16:46,086 --> 00:16:49,307
Here are some good examples. These are short descriptions that I really like.

363
00:16:49,887 --> 00:16:51,547
Dead Cells is a roguelike action...

364
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,548
roguelike metroidvania inspired action platformer. Right there.

365
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:58,769
Genre straight away. I love this short description.

366
00:16:59,349 --> 00:17:03,910
Fall Guys. Fall Guys is a massively multiplayer party game, up to 60 players online,

367
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:06,891
in a free-for-all struggle through round and round of escalating chaos,

368
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:11,092
until one victor remains. Perfect. That's a perfect encapsulation of the genre.

369
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:15,413
It shows verbs, it shows a genre, it shows that it's multiplayer. Perfect.

370
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:19,071
Most important thing is you should be clear.

371
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,493
Short descriptions work in conjunction

372
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:22,914
with all your other assets.

373
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:25,557
So if it feels like you missed out the fact

374
00:17:25,597 --> 00:17:27,438
that it's a spooky game in your short description,

375
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,521
that's okay because the heavy lifting of your theming

376
00:17:30,781 --> 00:17:32,943
is gonna be covered by those screenshots off to the side.

377
00:17:33,264 --> 00:17:34,805
So don't feel like your short description

378
00:17:34,865 --> 00:17:38,088
has to carry everything and have to enrapture

379
00:17:38,408 --> 00:17:39,369
all of it as your game.

380
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,831
Your whole Steam page works around

381
00:17:41,891 --> 00:17:43,213
with the rest of your short description.

382
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:48,633
So, let's talk about being crystal clear with your genre by getting better screenshots.

383
00:17:49,434 --> 00:17:53,559
So, these are screenshots for the new Resident Evil Village game.

384
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,025
Great game, it's got great marketing, but their screenshots don't really tell you what kind of

385
00:17:58,085 --> 00:18:01,929
genre it is. It's just a man screaming, a big sweaty man screaming, a zombie man.

386
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:03,872
I don't know. Like, why?

387
00:18:04,372 --> 00:18:09,135
Like, what genre is that? Am I controlling that guy? Am I shooting that guy? Is this a real-time

388
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:15,740
strategy where he's in my army that I'm going towards somebody? It's unclear what is happening

389
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,363
in the screenshot. It's evocative, but it doesn't tell you how to play the game. I know that you

390
00:18:21,423 --> 00:18:26,126
know because it's Resident Evil several sequels. What is it? Seven or eight? I can't remember. But

391
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:29,449
You don't have that luxury. This is probably your first game in the series.

392
00:18:29,749 --> 00:18:32,551
So you don't have that luxury of knowing what the past genre was.

393
00:18:32,991 --> 00:18:35,793
You need to be specific in your screenshots. So let's fix it.

394
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:38,375
I just went to a YouTube video of somebody playing the game.

395
00:18:38,615 --> 00:18:41,557
This is a much better screenshot telling more about this game.

396
00:18:41,937 --> 00:18:43,638
Look, you know it's a first person shooter now.

397
00:18:44,078 --> 00:18:47,080
There's a gun in the front, like, just like all first person shooters.

398
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,262
I know that there's 10 bullets, so that means that I'm going to be limited on my resources.

399
00:18:51,522 --> 00:18:53,323
There's an inventory on the left that tells me,

400
00:18:53,343 --> 00:18:56,005
oh, I've got limited weapons, I've got to figure out which weapon.

401
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:58,586
There's a knife, so it's going to be some close hand-to-hand combat.

402
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:01,628
There's only one guy, so it's going to be like tougher enemies.

403
00:19:02,288 --> 00:19:04,950
If you get the right screenshots, you can tell more about your game

404
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,391
rather than just some screaming, sweaty zombie man.

405
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:10,093
So, really, look at your screenshots

406
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:11,513
and really pick ones that...

407
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:12,874
Emphasize your genre.

408
00:19:13,914 --> 00:19:15,674
Let's talk about trope-conscious capsules.

409
00:19:16,174 --> 00:19:20,615
So, I don't know if you realize, but your capsules really evoke the genre.

410
00:19:21,075 --> 00:19:24,376
If you're doing a crafting game, a builder, you've got to include a hammer.

411
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,236
Look at all these building games. Include that hammer.

412
00:19:26,576 --> 00:19:29,957
Part of the reason I think that that kingdom workshop changed, that capsule changed,

413
00:19:30,217 --> 00:19:33,117
was it evoked the genre. It was a crafting building game.

414
00:19:33,377 --> 00:19:36,858
And look, what's that little troll have? It's got a hammer.

415
00:19:37,078 --> 00:19:38,498
Got to include the hammer if you've got a crafting game.

416
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,699
Simulator games. You got to put the vehicle that you're simulating and then you got to write the

417
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:49,301
name of the simulator in italicized, full-bodied, impact, sans-serif font, and then outline it with

418
00:19:49,341 --> 00:19:54,643
black text. Black outline. I don't know why, that's just the genre trope. All these simulator

419
00:19:54,683 --> 00:20:00,624
games look this similar way. If you're doing a space game, you got to have a pinkish-purply

420
00:20:00,924 --> 00:20:05,326
capsule. You got to have some planet sections. You got to have a spaceship where you have the

421
00:20:05,426 --> 00:20:08,226
trails coming behind it, and then you got to write your title in white text.

422
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:12,369
I didn't make these rules, somehow they just kind of evolve naturally.

423
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:15,691
Your genre is very dependent on the art style.

424
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:21,334
So study the other capsules and games in your genre, look at recent capsules because these

425
00:20:21,374 --> 00:20:24,736
trends change, you know, if you're watching this video in two or three years from now,

426
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:29,637
It could be a different trend, but just be aware of the current context of your genre.

427
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:32,158
And then when people see those, subconsciously like,

428
00:20:32,178 --> 00:20:33,358
I bet that's a space game.

429
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,519
It kind of, there's like a purple space, you know,

430
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:39,580
planet that I'm flying over in this screenshot or in this capsule.

431
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,600
Must be a space game.

432
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:42,201
That's the feeling you want to evoke.

433
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:46,162
So you want your capsule to mirror the other genres you're in.

434
00:20:47,924 --> 00:20:48,724
So let's do a recap.

435
00:20:49,045 --> 00:20:51,145
Here's how to tell genre to your shoppers

436
00:20:51,165 --> 00:20:52,506
and be crystal clear on your Steam page.

437
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:55,167
Have a short description that describes gameplay

438
00:20:55,227 --> 00:20:56,128
and genre tropes.

439
00:20:56,708 --> 00:20:58,869
Use screenshots that actually show UI

440
00:20:59,129 --> 00:21:00,789
and are indicative of your genre.

441
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,571
And then finally have capsules that are in line

442
00:21:03,811 --> 00:21:05,431
with other games in your genre.

443
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:08,293
You can innovate, but you should also keep some elements

444
00:21:08,353 --> 00:21:10,614
that have those hints towards the other genres.

445
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:14,515
Maybe a hammer here or there, or trails on the spaceship.

446
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:21,658
Here's a bonus genre FAQ that somebody always asks me whenever I talk about genres and making sure that they're similar.

447
00:21:21,878 --> 00:21:24,140
What if I have two genres? My game's a mix.

448
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,541
Okay, be honest with yourself.

449
00:21:26,802 --> 00:21:31,325
Usually these mix genres, usually there's one trunk genre that's the main part of the game,

450
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:33,727
and then a second genre is kind of stapled on the side.

451
00:21:34,147 --> 00:21:34,988
In a nice way, stapled.

452
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,290
If that's the case, focus.

453
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:40,992
Your genre that you should follow is still the main genre.

454
00:21:41,012 --> 00:21:44,475
Whatever your trunk genre is that's like 75% of your game is this genre.

455
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:47,070
But if you're honest and you're saying,

456
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,651
no, no, really, it's 50-50,

457
00:21:49,011 --> 00:21:50,192
half this genre, half this genre.

458
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:51,453
If that's the case,

459
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:53,915
you can actually change your Steam page all the time.

460
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,076
Your Steam page is not set in stone.

461
00:21:56,437 --> 00:21:58,498
So maybe one month you switch it to one genre

462
00:21:58,938 --> 00:22:01,080
and you swipe it to a different genre on the next month

463
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,081
and you keep swapping back, back and forth

464
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:05,002
and then kind of monitor.

465
00:22:05,443 --> 00:22:07,184
Does one genre that you focus on

466
00:22:07,684 --> 00:22:09,085
perform better than the other genre?

467
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:11,907
Maybe, so try it out, just test.

468
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,569
Sometimes fans of one genre don't like the other genre.

469
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:19,345
Okay, third problem, not working with the Steam algorithm.

470
00:22:19,845 --> 00:22:23,527
This one is really indicative of having to understand Steam.

471
00:22:23,988 --> 00:22:29,871
The way Steam makes their money is they know, down to the minute, how much people play each game.

472
00:22:29,992 --> 00:22:33,434
Each player has a record of which games they like the best according to Steam.

473
00:22:34,034 --> 00:22:37,975
And all the Steam algorithm does is it looks at which games the player plays the most of

474
00:22:38,235 --> 00:22:40,496
and then shows them more games in the same genre.

475
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,457
Look at all these widgets all over Steam. I just grabbed screenshots.

476
00:22:43,717 --> 00:22:45,617
It says, Recommended because you played these games.

477
00:22:46,058 --> 00:22:47,538
Because you like this game, you like this.

478
00:22:47,778 --> 00:22:50,719
You've played hours of this game. Here's why we're recommending this game.

479
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:55,080
So, you need to program the algorithm

480
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,021
so that these widgets will show your game to fans of your genre.

481
00:22:59,542 --> 00:23:01,523
And the way you do that is with tags.

482
00:23:02,024 --> 00:23:04,666
So this is a game, the before screenshot of a game,

483
00:23:05,547 --> 00:23:08,229
they took my class called Just Read the Instructions.

484
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,750
Great game on Steam.

485
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,132
It's a first-person shooter.

486
00:23:12,012 --> 00:23:13,974
But if you look at their tags, which is very small,

487
00:23:13,994 --> 00:23:15,295
let me show you a zoomed in.

488
00:23:16,316 --> 00:23:17,837
When you look at the tags,

489
00:23:18,238 --> 00:23:19,599
they weren't quite there yet.

490
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,000
So I'm going to show you how to do this.

491
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,022
Now, tags control everything for the Steam algorithm.

492
00:23:25,462 --> 00:23:29,383
Steam can't use some machine learning algorithm to figure out what kind of genre you have.

493
00:23:29,624 --> 00:23:30,584
It's all based on tags.

494
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:32,605
So you must tag correctly.

495
00:23:33,065 --> 00:23:38,087
Here are three games that are, if you're making a roguelike, key games.

496
00:23:39,087 --> 00:23:41,168
To do the tagging, I just have this spreadsheet.

497
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,541
And what I do is I find three games that are the top of the ranks.

498
00:23:44,921 --> 00:23:47,202
Everybody plays these games in the genre.

499
00:23:47,422 --> 00:23:50,244
And then I just list out the tags that are associated with each one of these

500
00:23:50,284 --> 00:23:50,824
from Steam.

501
00:23:51,424 --> 00:23:53,905
And then I go across all three columns and I figure out

502
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:56,206
all the ones that appear in all three of these games.

503
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,407
Those are your tags, as long as they do apply to your game.

504
00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:03,430
So the Just Read The Instructions developers

505
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:06,511
read what I kind of recommended for them.

506
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,932
And then afterwards, they improved their tags

507
00:24:08,972 --> 00:24:09,413
on their game.

508
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:11,213
So here's the before and after.

509
00:24:12,294 --> 00:24:15,335
Notice before they had shooter, action, puzzle, PVE,

510
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:16,475
but they didn't have FPS.

511
00:24:16,895 --> 00:24:19,496
They added the FPS tag because all the games they studied

512
00:24:19,576 --> 00:24:19,977
had that.

513
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:23,298
They also did online co-op because that one was in both.

514
00:24:23,498 --> 00:24:24,318
They took out action.

515
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:27,401
Again, I can't tell you, it's dependent on each game.

516
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:28,522
You've got to do your own research.

517
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:30,864
But for these guys, this new combination

518
00:24:31,245 --> 00:24:32,706
is what they picked based on their research.

519
00:24:33,026 --> 00:24:35,409
They also added more Steam features

520
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:37,210
and they added animated GIFs

521
00:24:37,631 --> 00:24:38,952
because their About This Game section

522
00:24:38,972 --> 00:24:40,273
didn't have any animated GIFs.

523
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:41,534
Guess what happened?

524
00:24:41,995 --> 00:24:46,797
immediate spike. You can see right where they made that tagging change. Isn't that amazing?

525
00:24:46,857 --> 00:24:51,498
Look at that. And their Steam wishlist went right up along with that increased traffic.

526
00:24:51,998 --> 00:24:56,800
What's going on here is Steam saw the tag change and it said, whoa, this looks like an FPS now.

527
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,381
They've got very clear FPS tags. I'm going to show them to fans of FPSs.

528
00:25:01,062 --> 00:25:04,025
And then all the fans from Steam were like, yes, this is an FPS game.

529
00:25:04,425 --> 00:25:07,208
They looked right at those gifts, everything, and they started

530
00:25:07,268 --> 00:25:10,631
wishlisting that game because Steam showed it to them because Steam was very

531
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,573
had a better understanding of what their game was.

532
00:25:13,274 --> 00:25:14,655
OK, here's the fourth problem.

533
00:25:14,715 --> 00:25:16,517
Fourth and final, you got a dead game.

534
00:25:16,898 --> 00:25:19,860
I hate this term, but Steam fans use it all the time.

535
00:25:21,202 --> 00:25:24,105
Typically applies to early access games or games that have been out for a while

536
00:25:24,125 --> 00:25:24,986
that haven't been updated.

537
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:27,756
Here's how to fix the dead game problem.

538
00:25:28,256 --> 00:25:31,180
Do Steam update events, post in your Steam forums

539
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:33,642
and add text to your capsules, okay?

540
00:25:34,183 --> 00:25:36,385
So this is, I pulled this from r slash Steam.

541
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:37,747
I love r slash Steam

542
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:39,609
because you see what the real fans say.

543
00:25:41,011 --> 00:25:42,712
They were commenting that it's mysterious

544
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:46,216
when games are updated, but nobody updates their patch notes.

545
00:25:46,617 --> 00:25:48,338
They say, I look for events and there's none.

546
00:25:48,698 --> 00:25:52,140
They want us to put events every time you update your game.

547
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:53,401
So you got to write those.

548
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:54,462
Let me show you an example.

549
00:25:54,862 --> 00:25:57,344
Here's a game called Chicken Police, really good game.

550
00:25:57,724 --> 00:26:00,326
Their events are like a textbook case of what you should do.

551
00:26:00,426 --> 00:26:01,687
So check out Chicken Police,

552
00:26:01,947 --> 00:26:02,727
look at their events.

553
00:26:03,488 --> 00:26:04,649
That's the section down here.

554
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:06,029
They do a dev blog.

555
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:09,452
Their dev blogs are like a mix of the game and

556
00:26:09,472 --> 00:26:12,274
the person's lifestyle, the developer's lives.

557
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:14,235
It's great. Just look at their events.

558
00:26:15,055 --> 00:26:17,717
Perfect case. This shows that your game is alive when you post these.

559
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:24,700
Another game, Quest of Dungeons, in their, this was a great idea they had, is in their forums,

560
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,703
they actually have a pinned message that just has a version number and a bullet point list of

561
00:26:29,823 --> 00:26:33,665
everything that changed. Do this. This just, then people can see how many updates you've done,

562
00:26:33,685 --> 00:26:35,806
that you're an active dev. This is good stuff.

563
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,684
Okay, also post in your Steam forums.

564
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,585
I know the forums are kind of cruddy sometimes,

565
00:26:41,906 --> 00:26:45,568
but at the bare minimum, pin an FAQ that says,

566
00:26:46,028 --> 00:26:47,649
common questions, like when it's coming to Switch.

567
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:49,510
They always ask when it's coming to Switch,

568
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,651
just have an answer here.

569
00:26:50,951 --> 00:26:53,692
Also, whether you support ultra widescreen 60 FPS,

570
00:26:53,872 --> 00:26:55,654
they're gonna ask you that too, have a comment,

571
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:58,095
I have a reason for that, whether you are or you're not.

572
00:26:58,655 --> 00:27:00,716
But pin that FAQ in your forum.

573
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:03,739
Also, pin a discussion thing of where to find you.

574
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,522
List your Twitter, your Discord, all that stuff.

575
00:27:06,922 --> 00:27:09,085
And if you're not going to be on the forums, tell them there.

576
00:27:09,145 --> 00:27:11,127
Say, hey, I'm just not checking the forums.

577
00:27:11,427 --> 00:27:12,248
I just don't have time.

578
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:13,989
You can check in their Discord.

579
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:14,750
Here's a link to it.

580
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:15,611
I'm always there.

581
00:27:15,911 --> 00:27:18,654
That kind of stuff just shows that you're communicating with your audience

582
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:20,576
and that you just haven't abandoned your game.

583
00:27:20,656 --> 00:27:21,097
It's not dead.

584
00:27:21,957 --> 00:27:25,521
Finally, add text to your capsules when you update it or you have a sale.

585
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:29,464
This is cool. I pull these. I always grab a screenshot any time I see somebody who

586
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:34,509
puts text in their capsule. I think it's great. They just give little descriptions of what's new.

587
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:42,356
Neon Abyss had an event called Titan's Advent. Elite Dangerous has new content available.

588
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:46,080
Season 2 of Fall Guys is live. There's a new demo for Potion Craft.

589
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,361
At a glance, you can see what's new in the game.

590
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:49,502
This thing really helps.

591
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:53,446
Do this for any big sale, especially at the seasonal sales, like winter sale,

592
00:27:53,486 --> 00:27:54,066
that kind of stuff.

593
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:57,429
Anytime you do an update, add a little description of what it is.

594
00:27:58,069 --> 00:28:02,073
So to fix the not dead game problem, add Steam event updates.

595
00:28:02,353 --> 00:28:03,434
Fans are looking for them.

596
00:28:03,454 --> 00:28:04,355
They really do read them.

597
00:28:04,755 --> 00:28:08,258
Post in your forums, add text to your capsules, all that stuff.

598
00:28:08,638 --> 00:28:10,780
But most importantly, you do have to update your game.

599
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,741
Keep it active.

600
00:28:11,781 --> 00:28:13,042
That's how you not have a dead game.

601
00:28:13,642 --> 00:28:18,325
Okay, how to implement this. Your mileage may vary. There's a lot of things I just described.

602
00:28:18,805 --> 00:28:22,187
Some games need one of these things that I talked about. Some games need other things.

603
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:27,450
You just got to try all of them. Just kind of experiment. Here's the thing. Some games that

604
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:31,352
have really high quality art already, the changes aren't as good. You know,

605
00:28:31,412 --> 00:28:33,713
they won't have as big an impact like on Dwarven Valley.

606
00:28:34,514 --> 00:28:38,078
swapping out from a low quality capsule to a very high quality one.

607
00:28:38,158 --> 00:28:39,600
That was a big jump in quality.

608
00:28:39,981 --> 00:28:42,925
If you've already got a high quality game, you might not see those impacts.

609
00:28:44,186 --> 00:28:47,170
And if your game is not good and the art's not good, I'm sorry.

610
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,672
These changes might not help.

611
00:28:48,892 --> 00:28:50,955
Steam audience is very savvy. They can't be fooled.

612
00:28:51,035 --> 00:28:52,337
So you got to make a good game.

613
00:28:53,266 --> 00:28:57,028
have a scientific mindset, be open to changes,

614
00:28:57,508 --> 00:28:58,769
see if they work, if they don't work,

615
00:28:58,829 --> 00:29:00,389
try a different change, don't give up,

616
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,770
don't say this is hopeless and nothing's changing,

617
00:29:03,331 --> 00:29:05,832
and test what I say, don't just believe everything I say,

618
00:29:06,352 --> 00:29:08,273
test it yourself, try it out, see what works.

619
00:29:09,053 --> 00:29:10,254
And then monitoring success,

620
00:29:10,774 --> 00:29:12,955
I don't like to look at the impression

621
00:29:12,995 --> 00:29:14,316
versus conversion rate click-through.

622
00:29:14,356 --> 00:29:15,696
That's kind of a murky number.

623
00:29:15,996 --> 00:29:16,857
Steam's very noisy.

624
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:19,898
I like to look at the number of wishlists.

625
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,238
That's the core number.

626
00:29:21,638 --> 00:29:22,619
Look at the number of wishlists,

627
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,600
track it weekly, track it daily.

628
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,660
If you improve your tags,

629
00:29:26,921 --> 00:29:28,521
you're gonna see a spike on discovery queue.

630
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:30,662
That's the only time I like the visibility,

631
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:31,642
marketing and visibility.

632
00:29:31,702 --> 00:29:33,923
So go to this page to see whether your tag changes

633
00:29:34,484 --> 00:29:35,124
have an impact.

634
00:29:35,344 --> 00:29:36,845
You'll see a spike in discovery queue.

635
00:29:36,885 --> 00:29:38,265
That indicates you've got good tags.

636
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:42,494
Okay, keep a diary. Every time you make a change, every day, track this data.

637
00:29:42,834 --> 00:29:45,896
If you want to get this chart, there's a template, howtomakeasteampage.com.

638
00:29:46,116 --> 00:29:50,200
I give you information on how to track this. Let's make a better Steam page.

639
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:55,964
There's my Twitter account, my email. If you need help with anything, email me.

640
00:29:56,044 --> 00:30:00,588
Howtomarketagame.com, that's my weekly blog. How to make a Steam page, that's my free class.

641
00:30:01,248 --> 00:30:04,771
Good luck, everybody. Have that scientific mindset. You're going to do great. I love you. Bye.
