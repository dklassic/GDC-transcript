00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:16,155
Welcome to my talk, creating narrative context for store cosmetics.

2
00:00:16,676 --> 00:00:21,959
Today we'll be discussing how your narrative teams can help you create highly valued cosmetics for your game store.

3
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,140
But first...

4
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:29,654
Hi, my name is Dori Schaffer, and I'm a Senior Narrative Designer for the Studio Proletariat.

5
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:34,323
I'm currently working on the game Spellbreak, a multiplayer action spellcasting game.

6
00:00:35,249 --> 00:00:40,131
My work on Spellbreak varies a lot, including creating quest content, writing dialogue,

7
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:44,933
and a lot more. But today I'll be talking about my work with the cosmetics team.

8
00:00:45,573 --> 00:00:51,916
I help the cosmetics team create titles and descriptions, but more than that, I help them

9
00:00:51,956 --> 00:00:58,579
develop narrative for cosmetics. But what exactly does that mean? And why is my studio paying me to

10
00:00:58,639 --> 00:00:58,940
do so?

11
00:01:00,444 --> 00:01:04,608
Today I'll discuss with you, why do cosmetics need narrative context?

12
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:07,270
How do we give cosmetics narrative context?

13
00:01:07,811 --> 00:01:10,453
And do cosmetics with narrative context perform better?

14
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:17,039
Given that GDC agreed to let me do this talk, the answers may not surprise you, but let's

15
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,820
go through them anyway.

16
00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:21,995
Why do cosmetics need narrative context?

17
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:24,757
Spellbreak has found that a lack of narrative context

18
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:27,698
for cosmetics will tend to lead to poor sales.

19
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:30,320
It also leads to a lack of artistic direction,

20
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,281
especially when outsourcing cosmetics.

21
00:01:32,861 --> 00:01:34,822
A lack of narrative context also makes it hard

22
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:38,164
to analyze store sales, such as what themes sell well,

23
00:01:38,584 --> 00:01:40,525
what should we do more of or less of?

24
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:42,686
Having a strong narrative direction

25
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:44,147
can help us answer these questions

26
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:45,448
and plan better for the future.

27
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:48,229
Boink.

28
00:01:48,669 --> 00:01:49,010
Giving.

29
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:53,535
Narrow direction to a cosmetics, the most important aspect is the theme.

30
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:57,898
This can be anything from cutesy witch or evil zombie.

31
00:01:58,398 --> 00:02:00,779
Here I split our cosmetics into four categories.

32
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,502
We first have strong theme, strong sales, represented by our outfit

33
00:02:05,902 --> 00:02:07,723
star weaver in the upper left corner.

34
00:02:08,704 --> 00:02:13,707
Next is weak theme, strong sales, represented by our outfit brooding corvid in the upper right.

35
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:18,630
Then weak sale, strong theme, represented by our outfit troubadour enchanter.

36
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,321
on the bottom left.

37
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,121
And finally, weak sails, weak theme,

38
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:26,302
represented by our outfit Valiant Falter on the lower right.

39
00:02:27,442 --> 00:02:29,263
I'll be breaking down each of these categories

40
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:30,783
and how these outfits represent them

41
00:02:30,923 --> 00:02:31,843
throughout the presentation.

42
00:02:33,324 --> 00:02:34,704
Starting with Valiant Falter,

43
00:02:35,264 --> 00:02:38,125
who represents both weak theme and weak sails.

44
00:02:39,965 --> 00:02:42,686
Valiant Falter was designed based on our game Springstep Rune,

45
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:43,846
an in-game ability.

46
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:46,407
This ability allows players to spring forward,

47
00:02:46,887 --> 00:02:48,708
a quick action that allows them to maneuver.

48
00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:55,125
This theme isn't particularly strong, but it is shown within the costumes use of literal springs.

49
00:02:55,826 --> 00:02:57,126
The question does come to mind though.

50
00:02:58,066 --> 00:02:59,406
What's the player fantasy here?

51
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:01,427
What narrative are we building?

52
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:07,968
When a player wears a skin, we want to give them a narrative experience of role-playing as this character as they play through the game.

53
00:03:08,648 --> 00:03:11,629
Unfortunately, there's just not much you can role-play as this character.

54
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:16,870
We identify the lack of a strong theme to be a direct result of this outfit's poor sales.

55
00:03:23,648 --> 00:03:27,791
But what about an outfit that has a strong theme, but poor sales?

56
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:28,892
Does that happen?

57
00:03:30,072 --> 00:03:33,514
Unfortunately, our game's troubadour enchanter is an example of this.

58
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:35,075
His theme is very evident.

59
00:03:35,555 --> 00:03:36,136
He's a bard.

60
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:37,797
He's handsome and dashing.

61
00:03:38,357 --> 00:03:42,980
He's paired with a lyre to strengthen this theme, which the player can purchase alongside him.

62
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,321
This is a strong player fantasy.

63
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,763
Bard is a very common fantasy trope.

64
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:53,269
However, we found that this theme did not resonate with our players, leading to poorer sales than expected.

65
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:59,452
We'll discuss later how power is a strong theme that resonates with our players,

66
00:04:00,013 --> 00:04:06,056
and upon reflection, we found that the Bard trope may not feel powerful to players, thus leading to its poor sales.

67
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,322
So what did we learn through these failures?

68
00:04:10,802 --> 00:04:14,346
First, as my talk would indicate, weak themes lead to weak sales.

69
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:19,892
As shown in the selection here, even outfits with solid designs and aesthetic choices can sell poorly.

70
00:04:20,472 --> 00:04:25,097
If an outfit isn't portraying a strong player fantasy, it's less appealing to purchase.

71
00:04:25,838 --> 00:04:30,159
On the flip side, the outfits theme could be strong but not resonate with players.

72
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:35,761
However, strong themes allow us to analyze player purchases. We can evaluate those themes,

73
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:40,682
discover which ones are the most popular, and create new cosmetics based on those themes.

74
00:04:42,563 --> 00:04:45,483
Thus, our team on Spellbreak came to the conclusion

75
00:04:46,504 --> 00:04:51,945
that cosmetics need narrative context. Surprise, surprise for all of you attending this talk.

76
00:04:52,873 --> 00:04:59,002
Now, as a narrative designer, I wouldn't have much to do with cosmetics generally, right?

77
00:04:59,242 --> 00:05:03,167
I mean, I come up with the names and descriptions, since I'm also the team's writer,

78
00:05:03,828 --> 00:05:06,232
but usually that comes after visuals are complete.

79
00:05:07,338 --> 00:05:11,403
Narrative design tends to be related to NPCs that feature in the game's story.

80
00:05:11,923 --> 00:05:16,989
For example, I may request a spunky character have short hair to show that she is spunky.

81
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,796
But for cosmetics, the characters don't have dialogue or story significance.

82
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:26,921
Does that mean they shouldn't have personalities, stories, themes?

83
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:32,644
Well, I'm here to argue that giving cosmetics narrative context leads to compelling character

84
00:05:32,684 --> 00:05:39,126
visuals. In turn, that leads to stronger overall player engagement and sales. Which begs the

85
00:05:39,146 --> 00:05:46,810
question, how do we give cosmetics narrative context? With Spellbreak, we start with narrative

86
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,671
prompts first and foremost, which are created by me.

87
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:55,031
I come up with these themes through team suggestions, research, and requests from store product

88
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:55,371
owners.

89
00:05:55,852 --> 00:05:59,615
Here I show an example of some narrative themes I came up with for Halloween content.

90
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:03,559
I like to have at least a placeholder name to help solidify discussion.

91
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,303
Maybe that placeholder name tends to be the final name.

92
00:06:07,823 --> 00:06:08,324
Maybe not.

93
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:11,767
But, you know, just so that we're referring to that.

94
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:20,893
Cosmetic by name during discussion and then later on when the visuals have been finalized and the theme has been finalized, finalizing that name and description as well.

95
00:06:21,807 --> 00:06:24,049
The narrative direction is short and to the point.

96
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:27,471
You're even linked to simple visuals to emphasize my point,

97
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:30,133
as you can see in the blue text within the Excel sheet.

98
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:34,336
While I may suggest visual directions

99
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:37,638
to help with the theme, I try not to be too specific.

100
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:40,440
Ultimately, this is just a starting point for discussion.

101
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,141
It is in no way final.

102
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:44,342
I create many, many themes,

103
00:06:44,402 --> 00:06:46,083
which are then selected by product owners

104
00:06:46,123 --> 00:06:46,984
to move forward with.

105
00:06:47,664 --> 00:06:49,165
Some may be rejected completely,

106
00:06:49,185 --> 00:06:50,586
and that's just the way it goes.

107
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:57,230
As for all of these prompts, all five were approved and moved forward with for our Halloween

108
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,695
holiday cosmetics outfits.

109
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:02,861
But today we're going to focus on a different skin.

110
00:07:05,297 --> 00:07:09,278
Our outfit Star Weaver is a great example of how we create cosmetics.

111
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,040
Here's how all of our beautiful, beautiful cosmetics start.

112
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,701
An Excel sheet. We start off with narrative themes I generate.

113
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:22,002
Here I created the narrative theme of a celestial theme with star motifs.

114
00:07:22,763 --> 00:07:25,523
I also like to have some short personality prompts.

115
00:07:25,704 --> 00:07:31,285
Here I selected daydreamer and elegant, which then leads us to our next step.

116
00:07:33,138 --> 00:07:35,319
Our visual brainstorming session.

117
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,741
This brainstorm includes the narrative team,

118
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:40,142
the character team, and other artists

119
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:42,904
who contribute to cosmetics, such as our VFX artists.

120
00:07:43,604 --> 00:07:45,165
Everyone collects visual reference

121
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:46,606
for the discussed cosmetics.

122
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:49,828
During this process, we decide what we would like to explore

123
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:51,630
and what we like to avoid in the visuals as well.

124
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,892
So there is a collection of visuals

125
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:57,313
as well as verbal discussion as well.

126
00:07:58,255 --> 00:08:07,723
From early on, the idea was pitched that the Star Weaver's outfit would have starry skin and cool emissives, as in exciting emissives, not just cool in color.

127
00:08:08,724 --> 00:08:13,248
We wanted space themes, but it figured to not look too science fiction.

128
00:08:13,448 --> 00:08:15,490
After all, our game is in the fantasy genre.

129
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:20,774
Our brainstorms will have dozens and dozens of references collected by the various team members.

130
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:25,158
But the character lead will then comb through the photos and choose a select few.

131
00:08:27,513 --> 00:08:35,217
From here, the artist will begin to draw concepts of the character based off of those visual prompts as well as the narrative prompt as well.

132
00:08:35,858 --> 00:08:41,421
Feedback is given primarily by the character lead, but at certain points the larger team will have a chance to give feedback as well.

133
00:08:42,341 --> 00:08:47,207
As a narrative designer, my feedback is focused on if the visuals match the decided theme.

134
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:52,234
I'm not here to talk about color theory. I'm not here to talk about specific visual

135
00:08:53,676 --> 00:08:58,782
anything, honestly. I'm not an artist that's not kind of... I'm not trying to give art direction.

136
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:04,102
I wanted Star Weaver to feel obviously celestial and elegant.

137
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:08,445
Of course, the theme may shift and change throughout the course of the concept phase.

138
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:13,488
Here you can see that the prompt, Daydreamer, isn't really present, which is fine.

139
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:18,652
Just as I may request visual changes to better suit the theme, I can also tweak the theme

140
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:22,154
to best represent visuals that the team is really excited about.

141
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:28,496
The effort is a collaboration between the two teams with the final goal of a strong theme and a strong visual.

142
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:30,937
We want to have both within this outfit.

143
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:35,999
And here's the complete product, our outfit Star Weaver.

144
00:09:36,739 --> 00:09:43,421
We also paired her with an artifact, Cloudburst, and Afterglow that players can purchase in a bundle.

145
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:47,562
So she has star-filled wings, celestial splendor, and a starry train.

146
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:52,783
This bundled cosmetics are all thematically and visually paired with the outfit.

147
00:09:53,203 --> 00:09:57,025
This helps both strengthen the outfit's theme and gives players a chance to easily match

148
00:09:57,165 --> 00:09:58,626
their various cosmetics.

149
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:02,767
So if you really like Star Weaver and you want to have an artifact, cloudburst, and

150
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:06,909
afterglow that matches her, you can just purchase her bundle and they all kind of match.

151
00:10:08,263 --> 00:10:09,484
They're created to match her.

152
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:14,546
Also like, you know, having a celestial themed outfit that then shoots out stars

153
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:18,928
as she falls to the ground and then has stars like twinkling by her feet as she

154
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:23,890
jumps up and down, that just really lends to her whole theme of being celestial

155
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:28,152
and elegant and, you know, quite frankly, very awesome.

156
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,692
I absolutely adore the skin.

157
00:10:31,713 --> 00:10:34,854
Uh, so do these cosmetics perform better?

158
00:10:35,904 --> 00:10:41,748
Given that I'm giving a GDC talk on the subject, I think we all knew that the answer would be a very definitive yes.

159
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:47,472
Our team has found that outfits with strong narrative content lead directly to stronger sales.

160
00:10:47,992 --> 00:10:52,676
On average, our higher performing outfits sell four times better than our underperforming ones.

161
00:10:53,276 --> 00:10:56,559
Of course, even strongly themed outfits aren't always a success.

162
00:10:56,619 --> 00:11:00,964
We're constantly analyzing which outfits do well and which outfits do poorly,

163
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:04,427
but we do find consistency with themes that do well,

164
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:06,749
and we can build on this knowledge with similar themes.

165
00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:11,914
For example, I might create another celestial outfit based off of the success of Star Weaver

166
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:15,878
because we know that our players really dig the idea of a celestial theme.

167
00:11:18,404 --> 00:11:20,425
So let's head back to our girl, Star Weaver.

168
00:11:21,005 --> 00:11:25,228
She performed wonderfully in our store, and it's not hard to see why.

169
00:11:25,248 --> 00:11:28,811
She has a very strong theme that is clearly shown in her visuals.

170
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:32,533
Because of her theme, we gave her a unique shader and a mix of elements,

171
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:37,976
which led to not only strengthen her celestial theme, but to create interesting and creative visuals.

172
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:43,300
This all leads to a strong player fantasy of playing as a celestial, magical being.

173
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,463
And we saw this reflected not only in player engagement, but also in strong sales.

174
00:11:47,803 --> 00:11:49,444
You know, a lot of players purchased her,

175
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:52,707
and they also really talked about her on social media a lot

176
00:11:52,807 --> 00:11:55,289
and forums as well, about how much they dug her.

177
00:11:58,432 --> 00:11:58,652
Now,

178
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:04,397
breeding Corvid here is a bit of an outlier

179
00:12:04,617 --> 00:12:05,758
that should still be counted.

180
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:09,131
He was not created with a strong theme in mind.

181
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:12,613
In fact, he's a retexture of a base outfit

182
00:12:13,373 --> 00:12:14,934
that we had when we launched the game.

183
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:17,776
However, his aesthetics are very strong.

184
00:12:17,876 --> 00:12:20,557
He's dark, he's brooding, he's mysterious.

185
00:12:21,858 --> 00:12:23,219
By analyzing his visuals,

186
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,540
we were able to get very early data

187
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,621
on a type of aesthetic that players enjoy.

188
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,303
From there, we were able to create themes that make the best of these aesthetics,

189
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:37,708
such as assassin or demonic character or villain, etc.

190
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:42,672
These types of themes have gone over very well with our players, as Bruton Corvid predicted.

191
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:49,659
So we can, by analyzing both themes and also visuals, we can then create themes that

192
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,283
work off of that data and create things that we think will further excite players.

193
00:12:56,601 --> 00:13:02,507
So what did we learn? This pipeline works. Starting our cosmetics pipeline with the fleshed out

194
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:07,912
narratives helped create stronger cosmetics overall, which then in turn leads to stronger

195
00:13:07,932 --> 00:13:12,076
sales. We were also able to analyze which themes resonated with players strongest,

196
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,878
and then in turn created cosmetics with similar themes.

197
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:19,200
Overall, our cosmetics collection is much stronger because of this pipeline.

198
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:26,041
So we see here some popular themes are mysterious, powerful, magical.

199
00:13:26,822 --> 00:13:29,882
So Black Knight, she's very mysterious.

200
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,123
You know, she has this mask that's covering her face.

201
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:34,943
She's kind of got blues and blacks on her outfit.

202
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:38,284
Blademaster Sakura, she looks very powerful.

203
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:42,865
She has, you know, samurai armor and this big katana on her back.

204
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:47,687
And Wayward Sorcerer is definitely looking very magical.

205
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:52,669
He kind of looks like your typical mysterious warlock kind of guy.

206
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:57,651
And these all sold very well and are also themes that we definitely recognize

207
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:59,772
as being popular and that we want to do more of.

208
00:14:02,452 --> 00:14:17,728
So taking the idea of themes to the next level, the Spellbreak team decided to create bundles around outfits, and these include artifacts, objects that float behind your player, cloud bursts, the VFX that plays when you drop down on the map, and afterglows, the VFX that plays when you jump up in the game.

209
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:23,817
The bundling these four cosmetics together help create a stronger sense of theme. For example,

210
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:28,103
that Blade Master Sakura skin that I just showed having a katana on her back really

211
00:14:28,203 --> 00:14:32,610
emphasizes her samurai theme. For example, for this slide, we

212
00:14:33,391 --> 00:14:37,195
We gave our river dragon outfit a watery dragon head cloudburst.

213
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:42,440
This furthers his theme and allows players to create visually cohesive cosmetic loadouts.

214
00:14:42,901 --> 00:14:46,885
It also increases sales for our non-outfit cosmetics since players are more drawn to

215
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:49,808
cosmetics that match their chosen outfits.

216
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:52,310
Here we have Cerebral Conjurer with her awesome

217
00:14:52,771 --> 00:15:03,520
Staff behind her, River Dragon as I talked about, and Sensational Soothsayer with a witchy cauldron with some tarot cards to show that she is a Soothsayer, you know, being able to look into the future and all that.

218
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,063
Just creating things that then strengthen the theme overall.

219
00:15:07,463 --> 00:15:11,787
And making sure that everything is very cohesive and adding to that theme.

220
00:15:14,634 --> 00:15:18,616
Unsurprisingly, holiday skins are also exciting for players to purchase.

221
00:15:19,116 --> 00:15:24,438
These skins were all timed offers we sold during the specific holiday that they represent.

222
00:15:25,138 --> 00:15:28,920
But even within these holidays, we want to stick with themes that we know will excite our players

223
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:31,881
while still staying true to the holiday it's representing.

224
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:36,543
These four outfits were very successful while being sold during their respective holidays.

225
00:15:39,222 --> 00:15:45,631
I'll give you guys just one second to guess which holiday is represented by which skin.

226
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,376
With a little bit of a cheating that we have two skins for the same holiday here.

227
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:54,546
Go ahead and get your guesses in now because I'm about to go over them.

228
00:15:55,027 --> 00:15:57,369
So, uh, the first skin is Rose, uh, sorry.

229
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:02,072
The first outfit is Rose Bloom Darling, and she was Valentine's Day.

230
00:16:02,292 --> 00:16:03,754
Uh, you can see she's very pink.

231
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:04,714
She has roses.

232
00:16:04,774 --> 00:16:07,857
She's very much representative of romance and love.

233
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:08,958
Um, and we shared that her.

234
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:15,321
outfit really conveyed that. Next up is the Baron, who is a Halloween skin, if you can believe it.

235
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:25,126
Very spooky and mysterious, as well as Snow Wraith, who is based off the Yuki Onna legend.

236
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:34,091
She is also mysterious and powerful, a ghostly kind of figure. And then Prancing Lion, who is a

237
00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:36,312
Chinese New Year skin as well.

238
00:16:37,235 --> 00:16:38,596
So, well, Skin.

239
00:16:39,576 --> 00:16:46,077
He is based off of the dancing lions in the parades for Chinese New Year.

240
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:51,178
All skins that we were very excited about as they were being made and they sold very

241
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,559
well and players seemed to really like them as well.

242
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:59,160
So just showing how we can tie holidays and themes together to create outfits that

243
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,560
players are really excited about.

244
00:17:03,286 --> 00:17:08,310
The Spellbird team also decided to create this concept of Ascending Cosmetics.

245
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:14,415
So these outfits upgrade as the players complete quest content specific to that outfit.

246
00:17:14,895 --> 00:17:21,140
So for example, you can deal damage with ice in our game, and that helps you upgrade the Ascending Valkyrie outfit.

247
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,222
This setup marries player action with player visuals.

248
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:29,907
The stronger, more experienced you become in game, the stronger, more experienced your outfit looks.

249
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:33,992
It also plays on the theme of power, which our players really resonate with.

250
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:39,739
These characters become more powerful looking as they are upgraded, which players really enjoyed.

251
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,524
So Valkyrie, and we also paired them with specific elements in the game.

252
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,767
In Spellbreak you can fight with ice.

253
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:58,475
lightning, air, toxic, fire, and wind. I believe I said those six correctly. So, Ascending Valkyrie

254
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:05,979
was our ice-themed skin. Our Corsair Ascending outfit is pyromancer-themed, so fire-themed.

255
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:08,840
And then our Ascending Titan skin was stone.

256
00:18:09,885 --> 00:18:11,486
Did I say stone in my listing?

257
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:14,326
I'm, this is off the top of my head.

258
00:18:14,406 --> 00:18:15,847
So he was representative stone.

259
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:21,168
So if you really like playing as a Frostborn ice mage player, you would

260
00:18:21,228 --> 00:18:26,470
definitely be drawn to Ascending Valkyrie as you also have to play as that class

261
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:29,110
to upgrade her and make her more powerful.

262
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:33,475
And we found that players really liked this idea and really dug it.

263
00:18:33,716 --> 00:18:35,998
And, you know, obviously very happy about that as well.

264
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:42,306
Put a lot of time and effort into creating exciting themes for these outfits since they are more labor intensive.

265
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:44,269
And also making sure that, um...

266
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,172
You know, they have something that players will definitely resonate with.

267
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:52,236
So this is just accumulation of all of our research of what themes do well

268
00:18:52,356 --> 00:18:56,119
and how can we create visuals to tie together with those themes and things like that.

269
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,801
Very exciting stuff, I suppose.

270
00:18:59,362 --> 00:19:03,405
I also did help implement the quest for these outfits as well.

271
00:19:06,909 --> 00:19:14,882
Which is funny that my other job of doing quest stuff then ties into my cosmetics gig of helping with themes and things like that.

272
00:19:17,316 --> 00:19:21,437
So, to reiterate the point of this talk, the thesis, the main point,

273
00:19:22,197 --> 00:19:24,978
I believe that cosmetics should have narrative context.

274
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:31,039
Whether this is decided by a member of your narrative design team, your writing team, or your art team,

275
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:37,281
starting the process of creating cosmetic by first creating narrative context is a good thing.

276
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:41,462
It can help you create cosmetics with stronger visuals that resonate with your players,

277
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:46,463
ultimately resulting in more sales, more player engagement, and a happier game community.

278
00:19:47,023 --> 00:19:52,205
I hope you can take this talk and you can kind of, you know, if you desire to do so,

279
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:57,268
implement it within your own cosmetics pipeline and try it out, or just, you know, see how we

280
00:19:57,308 --> 00:20:02,090
do things and what works for us, which I think is always exciting to see at a good old GDC.

281
00:20:04,362 --> 00:20:08,303
And that's it. That's my talk. Thank you so much for attending.

282
00:20:09,163 --> 00:20:13,344
If you have any questions or wish to contact me, here is my website, my Twitter.

283
00:20:13,364 --> 00:20:19,106
I'm also posting up my email. Feel free to shoot me any questions.

284
00:20:19,606 --> 00:20:24,847
I think at this time I'm also within the audience answering questions, hopefully as well.

285
00:20:25,907 --> 00:20:28,968
So you can always message me through the GDC app as well.

286
00:20:29,935 --> 00:20:31,858
And I hope you all have a great GDC.

287
00:20:31,878 --> 00:20:35,241
And once again, thank you for attending my talk.
