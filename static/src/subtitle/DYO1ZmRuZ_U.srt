1
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:05,839
Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,801
My name is Brandon Sheffield.

3
00:00:08,081 --> 00:00:12,043
I kind of helped coordinate this panel and bring it here.

4
00:00:12,063 --> 00:00:16,146
So I'm glad you're all here to see this super rare opportunity

5
00:00:16,546 --> 00:00:19,208
because these guys aren't usually

6
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:21,649
the ones talking about Sonic.

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:26,012
And it's really great to hear their perspective

8
00:00:26,712 --> 00:00:30,655
on the beginnings of this series that has sold millions

9
00:00:30,735 --> 00:00:33,236
and is one of the biggest franchises in the world.

10
00:00:33,777 --> 00:00:39,699
and how this started from nothing to become the giant monolith that it is today.

11
00:00:39,819 --> 00:00:44,820
So they're going to do their own intros, but we have Yasuhara-san,

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,061
who did all the maps and game design,

13
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:55,323
and we have Oshima-san, who did all of the visual designs and other things.

14
00:00:55,863 --> 00:01:00,204
So after this, after they go through their sessions,

15
00:01:00,244 --> 00:01:01,184
I'll ask them a couple of...

16
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:07,933
questions and we'll have a little fun treat at the end of it and then we'll open up the floor a little bit.

17
00:01:08,613 --> 00:01:12,914
And I know that a lot of people are probably going to want to get signatures and things like that.

18
00:01:12,954 --> 00:01:16,395
We're probably going to have to take that outside to the wrap-up room.

19
00:01:16,715 --> 00:01:18,775
I'm just going to let you know that in advance.

20
00:01:19,355 --> 00:01:23,036
And so let's just go ahead and get started Yasuhara-san.

21
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:24,216
Oh, okay.

22
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,841
Wow, thank you for coming.

23
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:33,182
So I'm really glad to have such kind of the very rare

24
00:01:33,282 --> 00:01:38,263
opportunity to share our experiences to make

25
00:01:38,803 --> 00:01:40,964
the characters, the game characters.

26
00:01:41,224 --> 00:01:42,544
So thank you for coming.

27
00:01:42,564 --> 00:01:43,404
So I appreciate it.

28
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:49,145
And first of all, so this one.

29
00:01:49,665 --> 00:01:50,486
OK.

30
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:54,487
So my name is Hirokazu Yasuhara.

31
00:01:55,621 --> 00:02:01,364
I've worked on the game industry more than 30 years.

32
00:02:02,224 --> 00:02:03,145
Oh, I'm speaking English.

33
00:02:03,185 --> 00:02:05,206
I should speak Japanese.

34
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:05,346
Sorry.

35
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:07,387
I'll speak Japanese.

36
00:02:07,447 --> 00:02:08,387
It doesn't matter.

37
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:10,808
OK, next.

38
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:12,269
Mr. Oshima.

39
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:15,390
I'm Oshima.

40
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:18,752
Hi, everyone. I'm Oshima.

41
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:21,913
Thank you so much.

42
00:02:31,179 --> 00:02:34,023
Thank you.

43
00:02:34,744 --> 00:02:41,673
So today's session, we're going to have to sort of stick to these three big topics, but I promise there's a lot to cover.

44
00:02:42,582 --> 00:02:48,044
So, the beginnings and the origins of Sonic, anecdotes about the game, and of course, the result, what happened once we created Sonic.

45
00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:48,624
Okay, let's start.

46
00:02:48,664 --> 00:02:49,424
So, the beginnings.

47
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:50,624
Well, in the early 1990s,

48
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:51,205
Sega was, well,

49
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:26,463
So as you can see here, in 1990, Sega wanted a next generation character that could stand

50
00:03:26,543 --> 00:03:28,905
up to the NES and Mario.

51
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:35,909
We were not able to compete in the 8-bit console consumer market with it, so we had to come

52
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:36,550
up with something.

53
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:42,040
YUKKE HIRAHARA But I think it's fair to say that Sega did

54
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,683
not value characters and their worth very highly in terms of how marketable they could

55
00:03:48,703 --> 00:03:48,763
be.

56
00:04:03,365 --> 00:04:09,429
Instead, they kind of treated characters as something that was created, used, and then disposed.

57
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,412
So the thinking was sort of shifting a little bit.

58
00:04:13,432 --> 00:04:17,615
The company was wanting something that could be representative of the company.

59
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:34,066
Let it be iconic and have a longer sort of lifespan.

60
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:38,929
And so then the question is, why a hedgehog then?

61
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:41,010
So a character that can deal damage by curling up like a ball.

62
00:04:58,175 --> 00:05:00,475
roll around at a very fast pace.

63
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:09,537
Yeah, as you can see at the very bottom,

64
00:05:09,657 --> 00:05:13,258
old guy with a mustache, the one that became the Eggman, that was even one of

65
00:05:13,278 --> 00:05:14,238
the ideas as well.

66
00:05:14,258 --> 00:05:16,339
So people from the company

67
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:18,759
made a guy who had a mustache,

68
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:34,896
and hedgehogs, and also a character with a dog.

69
00:05:34,916 --> 00:05:37,717
I was going to New York to play,

70
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:41,039
and I took a poll at Central Park with a placard.

71
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:44,360
And the hedgehog was the most popular.

72
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:47,742
And the second place was the bearded old man.

73
00:05:55,527 --> 00:06:02,031
So, I thought, this is just a joke.

74
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:11,717
I think the fact that they chose Sonic, regardless of race, was a big factor.

75
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:19,222
So there's actually a really, I don't know, a nostalgic story or episode here.

76
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:24,905
I planned a trip to New York while this discussion was going on internally.

77
00:06:25,526 --> 00:06:29,847
And so the company and we were talking and they said,

78
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:33,168
you know what, we definitely want to see something

79
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:37,429
like an old guy with a mustache as an idea.

80
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:41,330
We also want to see something that's sort of spiky,

81
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,511
a hedgehog or even a porcupine.

82
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:47,072
And then we also want to see a dog-like or dog character.

83
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:50,292
And so I drew these on a board

84
00:06:50,312 --> 00:06:53,213
and I am in the middle of Central Park.

85
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:54,433
This is a true story.

86
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,224
And I'm showing people these three boards randomly,

87
00:07:01,085 --> 00:07:02,046
taking a survey.

88
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:07,370
And the result was is that the hedgehog

89
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,831
was the most popular,

90
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:10,733
people really pointed at it and liked it.

91
00:07:11,914 --> 00:07:13,935
Second was actually Eggman.

92
00:07:15,797 --> 00:07:17,859
And then third was the dog.

93
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,580
And so I was like, wow, this is a...

94
00:07:20,411 --> 00:07:23,912
you know, kind of surprising or a pleasant surprise.

95
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,754
And so I was asking myself, I wonder why it is?

96
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:35,036
And the conclusion to me, without, you know, having nailed like one single

97
00:07:35,136 --> 00:07:40,578
answer, to me what was more convincing was that by a lot of people

98
00:07:40,638 --> 00:07:45,760
choosing the hedgehog, that meant that it will transcend race and just different

99
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,140
types of

100
00:07:46,564 --> 00:07:54,589
people, gender, everything. And so I brought back that result with me and reported it back to the company.

101
00:07:54,609 --> 00:07:58,972
Yes, that's right.

102
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:00,353
So, speaking of character design,

103
00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:06,617
I've always thought that good characters are made with simple lines.

104
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:19,905
So as you can see here, character composed of lines so simple you could draw it as part of a sing-along song, like when we had the song playing.

105
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:29,149
You know, we feel like a great character can be easily sort of sketched or drawn with just a simple sort of few lines here and there.

106
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:33,250
For example, if a child were to...

107
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,990
Is this my place?

108
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,631
Yes, go ahead.

109
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:36,911
Ok.

110
00:08:37,272 --> 00:08:39,592
So, anyway, it goes like this.

111
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:50,442
So I think that was my part, so I'm going to take over from here.

112
00:08:50,522 --> 00:08:54,924
But Yasuhara-san is always sort of like bugging me from the side like this,

113
00:08:55,044 --> 00:08:59,346
and wanting to talk about these things, but let me talk a little bit about the process here.

114
00:08:59,366 --> 00:09:06,150
I didn't want Sonic to be a character with a lot of individuality.

115
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:13,132
I was aiming for a character that was easy to relate to.

116
00:09:13,232 --> 00:09:19,474
I just wanted to have a character that was easy to relate to,

117
00:09:19,554 --> 00:09:23,455
and that had the blue hedgehog as its characteristic.

118
00:09:23,535 --> 00:09:28,696
I didn't want to make a character that was easy to relate to,

119
00:09:29,016 --> 00:09:32,737
and that was just like, wow, that's amazing.

120
00:09:32,757 --> 00:09:36,798
I was really looking for a character that was easy to relate to.

121
00:09:39,562 --> 00:09:44,465
So, as you can see here, we said we wanted a character kids could draw, just simple.

122
00:10:05,632 --> 00:10:11,800
But first and foremost, in creating this character, we didn't want it to be so foreign and like

123
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,666
almost too pronounced where it was not familiar.

124
00:10:16,846 --> 00:10:22,714
We wanted that level of familiarity and even a level of kind of comfort.

125
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:28,675
that you would be able to kind of have, you know, a quick sort of relationship,

126
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:34,699
like build a relationship, be an affectionate character for you. So the point was to make it

127
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:41,883
into a character that feels familiar. You've maybe seen a figure or a silhouette or someone

128
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:48,407
or a character or an animal that looks like what became Sonic. But there are points that

129
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:51,849
we wanted to focus on and those are the connected eyes.

130
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:00,241
and him being blue. And then obviously we thought okay we haven't seen anything like this.

131
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:07,262
And then we added the pupils and then balanced it in a way that felt right so that there was at

132
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:14,344
least some level of kind of uniqueness and individuality. So all throughout this process

133
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:19,665
Yasara-san is like no but it needs to be simple enough so that anyone can draw it. I want like

134
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:22,945
little kids to be able to mimic and draw our character.

135
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:28,746
So, because I was thinking that way, I was like, OK, I want it to be simple enough and

136
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:28,906
draw.

137
00:11:28,946 --> 00:11:33,107
So you see, obviously, the end result on the left-hand side, but the simple drawing that

138
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:33,787
I drew looked like that.

139
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:57,931
So that's the version that I used with any of the sketches, if I was sort of, you know,

140
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:03,954
doing some map design or anything, that's the version of Sonic that I consistently used.

141
00:12:04,895 --> 00:12:17,322
Watashi mo kono karakutā wo sugo kini tte, nihon no torisetsu ni kono karakutā o banban nosete imasu.

142
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:22,719
Yeah, it's cute, so I fell in love with it too.

143
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,181
And we didn't let it go to waste.

144
00:12:26,502 --> 00:12:30,965
We used it a lot in the owner's manual, the instruction manual

145
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:33,167
that came in the Japanese version of the games.

146
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:35,348
Yes.

147
00:12:35,368 --> 00:12:38,250
Next, let's talk about the characters.

148
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:41,132
To make it a SEGA character,

149
00:12:41,152 --> 00:12:45,235
you have to know that it's SEGA the moment you see it.

150
00:12:48,228 --> 00:12:53,812
So, although this statement here may sound very as a matter of fact,

151
00:12:54,593 --> 00:12:59,417
but the biggest challenge for us, because we didn't have those characters that had a long lifespan,

152
00:12:59,457 --> 00:13:03,901
the challenge was that we needed to overcome, you know,

153
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:10,406
what needs to be done to create a character that represents Sega, the company, the brand.

154
00:13:11,247 --> 00:13:13,769
We needed a character that could represent all of Sega.

155
00:13:15,485 --> 00:13:20,366
So this character really had to kind of carry the entire weight on its shoulder and say,

156
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:25,688
okay, yes, I am Sega, like I can define what Sega is by seeing this character.

157
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:31,229
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA What I mean by that is, for example, why is Sonic blue?

158
00:13:31,249 --> 00:13:34,490
For me, it's because the Sega logo is blue.

159
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,011
Again, as a matter of fact, but we didn't have to really...

160
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:48,468
take a look at any other colors. Why is Sonic blue? Because that was Sega's brand color.

161
00:13:48,488 --> 00:13:56,655
And then here we have listed some of the merits of having a fictional animal character.

162
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:14,606
as the character that represents the brand.

163
00:14:15,926 --> 00:14:18,807
There's always some, you know, there's not always

164
00:14:19,287 --> 00:14:23,528
pluses and sort of upsides, but we found a few that made sense for us here.

165
00:14:23,548 --> 00:14:26,869
The moment you see it, anyone can tell.

166
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:32,091
And to promote it, even if you don't know the company, you know the character.

167
00:14:39,642 --> 00:14:46,488
Yeah, and so we wanted, like I said earlier, there needs to be a little bit of that unique

168
00:14:46,588 --> 00:14:49,690
originality, but still be somewhat familiar.

169
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:55,696
I think the important thing for us was that it represented the company, and even if someone

170
00:14:55,836 --> 00:15:01,360
didn't remember the company name, that they would quickly associate the character with

171
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:02,461
that company.

172
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:10,390
And then another factor was that we can turn this character basically into a business of its own.

173
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,411
So for example, merchandise, etc.

174
00:15:12,451 --> 00:15:19,194
So there were three sort of pillars that we went by in coming up with

175
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:35,797
what is in line with Sega's, what we call, high concepts.

176
00:15:37,498 --> 00:15:47,262
So those three are here, that it's cool, that it has a kind of challenger spirit,

177
00:15:47,902 --> 00:15:50,803
and that there's history or background to the character.

178
00:15:50,823 --> 00:15:59,367
We created a mind map, and the image of Sega came up with a lot of keywords.

179
00:16:01,525 --> 00:16:05,326
And so as you can see here, we call it a mind map of Sega.

180
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:09,887
All these key words that sort of express or describe

181
00:16:09,987 --> 00:16:14,108
our brand values and philosophies.

182
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:20,010
And so obviously, we picked the right word that's in red,

183
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:20,870
cool.

184
00:16:30,306 --> 00:16:32,507
And based on that, we went to work.

185
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:45,213
And, you know, cool is a nice word, but how do you define cool?

186
00:16:45,493 --> 00:16:48,635
Like, everyone's definition of cool could be pretty different.

187
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:52,577
Cool is not about shape or appearance.

188
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:53,477
It's about attitude.

189
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:10,227
So cool can be something that is more on the surface, visual, visually sort of I guess

190
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:14,528
expressive or expressing or just cool character design.

191
00:17:14,688 --> 00:17:17,508
But that wasn't the cool that we were looking for.

192
00:17:18,008 --> 00:17:21,769
And so there were all these factors on the right hand side.

193
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:27,530
It was more about the attitude of coolness and bringing that somehow into the character

194
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:27,910
design.

195
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:34,895
So another thing that we, in addition to this, is that a substantive sort of coolness, it

196
00:17:34,915 --> 00:17:38,038
says here is that I wanted it to be

197
00:18:00,072 --> 00:18:07,114
what would you call it, that you wouldn't be, I guess, sort of afraid or sort of fearful,

198
00:18:07,414 --> 00:18:16,856
or it wouldn't kind of lose its coolness. And so when it's looking at you, or when the fans

199
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:23,938
or the users are looking at the facial expression of Sonic, that it would be kind of, you know,

200
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:26,058
have a stare or like a cool attitude.

201
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:34,823
That's a trademark. So that's something that I really wanted to show through its kind of stare, I guess.

202
00:18:35,343 --> 00:18:44,065
So I wanted the characteristic of Sonic to really come out or stand out from that sort of attitude that we were trying to create.

203
00:18:53,663 --> 00:18:55,964
The second one is that Sega is a challenger or has that challenger spirit.

204
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:57,165
At that time, when Q10 was first announced,

205
00:18:57,545 --> 00:19:00,806
people started to say that eco-boom, ecology and the environment are important.

206
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:30,016
So there's, I guess, some elements and atmosphere, as it says here, that was kind of happening in the early 90s.

207
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:37,060
And, yeah, not just restricted to our industry or tech or software, but even in the worlds of fashion and kind of like eco-friendly,

208
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:55,274
and eco-friendly, environmentally sort of like, I guess, conscious sort of fields of businesses,

209
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:57,435
there was all this movement going on.

210
00:19:57,455 --> 00:20:04,000
So how that's, I guess, tied back into what we were doing as game companies and game creators,

211
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,240
it was.

212
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:22,616
I can say that it was kind of an era where we began to think about our environment a little bit more.

213
00:20:22,636 --> 00:20:26,397
And that sort of idea, as a result, was kind of rooted into this slide you see here.

214
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:28,778
So in our game world, we use the idea of nature versus environmental development.

215
00:20:53,683 --> 00:21:00,005
And the third element is that we talked about we wanted to have the character to have its

216
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:01,306
own history or background.

217
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:07,648
For us, this kind of history is not in the original character, so we had to do something.

218
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:27,185
So if you look at these other, I guess, series or very well-known character sets or families,

219
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:31,628
you know, these characters have their own world, they have their own story, they have

220
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:32,629
their own background.

221
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:37,553
In the meantime, we don't have anything, we're just trying to come up with a character here.

222
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:42,117
So we thought about having or giving the character its own history.

223
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:47,179
On the other hand, as a company, there was history.

224
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:51,423
Sega was a company that imported American jukeboxes and pinball machines.

225
00:22:12,482 --> 00:22:16,184
And while it may not be a direct connection from what I just said, there is an element

226
00:22:16,464 --> 00:22:23,109
of American culture and importing parts of these businesses, and so that led to Oshima-san's

227
00:22:23,189 --> 00:22:24,469
interest that he had.

228
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:48,581
at that time, airplane nose art, emblems and leather jackets.

229
00:22:56,925 --> 00:23:03,908
So then we used that as a base for coming up with this story and trying to develop a

230
00:23:04,629 --> 00:23:10,792
convincing enough or a colorful enough kind of story as to how we can land this character to

231
00:23:10,852 --> 00:23:11,772
have this story.

232
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,561
that's connected to something that Oshima-san is really into.

233
00:23:21,324 --> 00:23:24,446
And then that's when I came in and actually wrote the story for him.

234
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:25,986
At first, it was me.

235
00:23:26,006 --> 00:23:26,527
No, no, no.

236
00:23:26,627 --> 00:23:27,867
I didn't write it by myself.

237
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:28,908
Of course not.

238
00:23:28,928 --> 00:23:32,670
So what I wrote is something like this.

239
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:50,336
There was a pilot named Harinezumi, and he was riding a nose art with a picture of a hedgehog.

240
00:23:50,376 --> 00:23:54,038
His wife drew a picture of a hedgehog.

241
00:23:54,258 --> 00:24:00,903
He was wearing a jacket with a hedgehog character embroidered on it.

242
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:14,365
So I don't think I need to translate it, but this is basically the gist of the story that

243
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:20,630
I came up with, and the slide earlier was really like put into an actual like scenario

244
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,954
form to make it legit before presenting it to the company.

245
00:24:26,414 --> 00:24:26,734
Here it is.

246
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:48,842
So yeah, Sonic, for one, the story in there is that it's connected to this background story

247
00:24:50,703 --> 00:25:00,468
of the author. The premise is that she actually wrote the story that you see in Sonic 1.

248
00:25:00,689 --> 00:25:03,510
So it's all kind of connected.

249
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:10,736
So this, yeah, this was drawn by Oshima-san.

250
00:25:10,817 --> 00:25:13,658
It brings back a lot of memories for us.

251
00:25:13,798 --> 00:25:19,261
And that's why, I think now that you know a little bit about the story that we wrote,

252
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:42,982
for coming up with Sonic, the emblem on this leather jacket or the flight jacket,

253
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:49,346
it really goes well with the story that we developed and I think you can, you know,

254
00:25:49,426 --> 00:25:52,428
instantly sort of recognize that feel as well.

255
00:25:52,448 --> 00:25:56,971
This is exactly the art or the illustration that I drew at that time.

256
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:05,896
as is.

257
00:26:06,116 --> 00:26:11,099
So, yeah, we're going to talk a little bit about the game now.

258
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:16,762
Yeah, with the new technology, obviously we were moving on to 16-bit games.

259
00:26:16,782 --> 00:26:16,902
Yeah.

260
00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:43,277
And what that allowed us to do, not just us, but the generation at that time, it pushed

261
00:26:43,297 --> 00:26:45,639
us into so many different directions.

262
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:02,249
as you see here, the smoother geography,

263
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,951
tricks to convey the feeling of speed,

264
00:27:06,131 --> 00:27:08,473
much faster sensation of speed,

265
00:27:09,054 --> 00:27:12,236
and then lots of larger objects and moving objects.

266
00:27:13,517 --> 00:27:18,020
This is not something that anyone can do,

267
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,363
but a genius programmer called Yuji Naka

268
00:27:21,423 --> 00:27:25,306
is doing it by creating a way to really hit the back of the hardware.

269
00:27:29,235 --> 00:27:34,918
So we can now say looking back that that was the technology that became available, but it wasn't that

270
00:27:35,698 --> 00:27:42,001
everyone, all the game developers at that time was able to really take full advantage of what was

271
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:50,085
about to become available. We truly think that Naka-san was front and center in trying to figure

272
00:27:50,245 --> 00:27:57,168
out how can we best utilize the technology that we have now and try to get all this, try to extract.

273
00:27:57,903 --> 00:28:01,325
the end result from the hardware that we have sitting right in front of us.

274
00:28:01,405 --> 00:28:06,808
So I think it was a very special moment for us to see that really come to life.

275
00:28:14,612 --> 00:28:18,954
So based on that, these are just some examples that we came up with.

276
00:28:19,054 --> 00:28:24,017
It's like, now we can do this. Let's see what it looks like, how it feels like.

277
00:28:24,117 --> 00:28:26,558
So these are just some examples that we brought.

278
00:28:27,871 --> 00:28:28,652
from those days.

279
00:28:33,035 --> 00:28:34,116
So we tried these out.

280
00:28:34,416 --> 00:28:37,418
It was an iterative process, obviously,

281
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:40,080
but we wanted to see how far we can take it.

282
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:47,946
At the time, Mario was a game that you could practice and get better at.

283
00:28:47,966 --> 00:28:51,829
Sonic was more like a Sega's experience game.

284
00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:54,350
We wanted to make an amusement theme park.

285
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:08,926
The biggest difference that I can say, differentiating I guess factor between Mario and how you played

286
00:29:09,646 --> 00:29:16,351
games based on Mario as a character versus Sonic, is that Mario had, or games that they

287
00:29:16,371 --> 00:29:17,412
made were more of...

288
00:29:20,067 --> 00:29:26,730
you play and play repeatedly and you get better. It was skill based but also exploring the world

289
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:34,533
world in that manner. Whereas with us it was almost like Sonic was taking you but also you

290
00:29:34,553 --> 00:29:39,996
were in throwing an environment where it felt more of like an amusement park scenario. So you're

291
00:29:40,096 --> 00:29:47,779
enjoying what is around you in the environment and Sonic is helping you sort of experience that.

292
00:29:50,273 --> 00:29:55,074
So again, these are some design notes from back in the days.

293
00:29:55,174 --> 00:29:58,495
It was a very simple kind of flow.

294
00:29:58,515 --> 00:30:03,596
So first what I would do is I would have these rough quick sketches about level design.

295
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,672
and then I would share it with our programmer and our artist.

296
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:26,595
We would then discuss, you know, going back and forth, how we can do this, how we can

297
00:30:27,376 --> 00:30:33,300
prioritize some of these ideas and concepts and make it work.

298
00:30:34,141 --> 00:30:39,244
So I actually didn't really have like proper game design documents.

299
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,782
So the one with X's, just to prove that not every idea works or can be worked on right away,

300
00:30:58,203 --> 00:31:05,705
the one with the X's on the right hand side, we wanted to, but we knew we just either couldn't

301
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:11,887
or it just wasn't possible at that time, so we were going to deprioritize them for a much later time.

302
00:31:11,907 --> 00:31:15,388
Well, in the end, everything fit in and they had us use it.

303
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:21,702
But in the end, we were actually able to bring them back onto the table and make it work.

304
00:31:22,583 --> 00:31:28,825
So here's another example, an actual sort of level map and how we drew them and assembled them.

305
00:31:28,985 --> 00:31:32,326
So due to obviously the memory restrictions.

306
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:51,966
of the hardware, I can only use sets of 64 parts or panels for each of the zones,

307
00:31:52,566 --> 00:31:57,227
and then I would build three unique levels with those parts.

308
00:31:58,188 --> 00:32:02,589
But as you can see, you know, the blue frame part that says background,

309
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:15,924
I wouldn't be able to use all of it because of the part on top that you see there.

310
00:32:15,944 --> 00:32:28,231
There you go, yeah, now highlighting the top level, the tunnel.

311
00:32:29,832 --> 00:32:32,134
And then I would end up using two more for the tunnel.

312
00:32:33,094 --> 00:32:36,356
And the enemy is the same.

313
00:32:44,553 --> 00:32:54,478
Same with the enemy designs, they seem like just rough ideas, sketched, but it was a very similar process.

314
00:32:54,899 --> 00:33:01,262
I would just make rough quick notes, and then draw these sketches, how they looked, how they act,

315
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:04,884
what kind of enemies, and then just have a discussion with the team.

316
00:33:09,217 --> 00:33:10,718
He drew it for me.

317
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:10,939
Yes.

318
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:12,340
Yes.

319
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:14,301
Yes.

320
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:20,745
I will talk about the animation of the player.

321
00:33:20,825 --> 00:33:23,507
I will draw with dots.

322
00:33:23,788 --> 00:33:28,191
Before that, I will draw a lot of pictures like this on the sketchbook.

323
00:33:28,311 --> 00:33:33,975
I have to make the movement in a small pattern.

324
00:33:34,075 --> 00:33:35,796
I will draw it on the sketchbook.

325
00:33:39,152 --> 00:33:42,052
So I'm going to talk just a little bit about the animations for the player character.

326
00:33:42,132 --> 00:33:45,353
Pretty simple, but before reproducing my ideas using pixels, what I would do is,

327
00:33:45,413 --> 00:33:47,454
in my sketchbook, I would draw these that you see here.

328
00:33:47,474 --> 00:33:47,554
But...

329
00:34:07,362 --> 00:34:12,506
knowing that the animations needed to work in a pretty sort of small volume,

330
00:34:12,986 --> 00:34:21,312
I would just iterate and draw a lot up front before reproducing them in pixels.

331
00:34:23,213 --> 00:34:26,195
I'm Eggman, but I'm not an animator.

332
00:34:34,692 --> 00:34:41,218
So with Eggman or any of the really other non-player characters, it was the same situation or the same flow

333
00:35:02,335 --> 00:35:06,598
I did not have any experience as an animator,

334
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:10,220
nor did I do any studies in animation.

335
00:35:10,361 --> 00:35:15,044
So really I had to spend a lot of time watching anime

336
00:35:15,104 --> 00:35:18,726
or watching film and kind of scrubbing back and forth

337
00:35:18,806 --> 00:35:20,087
and seeing how it's done.

338
00:35:20,607 --> 00:35:22,309
And so all of that learning,

339
00:35:22,529 --> 00:35:25,210
I wanted to first lay it out in sketch form

340
00:35:25,711 --> 00:35:29,553
before producing them and moving forward in pixels.

341
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:33,496
So these are some of the actual examples that I drew at that time.

342
00:36:05,714 --> 00:36:16,017
So, this is the dancing, or dance animation, that I was really kind of committed and strongly

343
00:36:16,117 --> 00:36:17,337
wanting to put in the game.

344
00:36:17,357 --> 00:36:25,380
I thought it was a nailed thing, and sadly though, it didn't make it into the game.

345
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,060
It just didn't fit.

346
00:36:27,577 --> 00:36:36,220
you know, capacity-wise into the game. So, unfortunately, we never got to see the dance animation.

347
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:43,162
The fabled dance animation that no one ever got to see in the game.

348
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,770
Sonic was made for the winter of 1991.

349
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:00,271
The reason for this is that SNES, Super Famicom,

350
00:37:00,311 --> 00:37:02,991
was going to be released, so we decided to hit that.

351
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:04,871
Super NES was $199 with Mario,

352
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:05,912
and Genesis was $149 with Sonic.

353
00:37:27,897 --> 00:37:34,422
So here we have really a high-level summary of some of the marketing efforts and campaigns

354
00:37:34,522 --> 00:37:37,164
that were happening at that time.

355
00:37:37,184 --> 00:37:41,228
I don't know if any of you in the audience remember 1991 in this manner.

356
00:37:43,696 --> 00:37:51,520
Oh, you do? Oh, good. Small amount though, I think. But basically, yeah, the Super NES

357
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:58,603
was going for $199 with Super Mario World bundled in it, and then for Sega, it was bundled

358
00:37:58,663 --> 00:38:06,067
with the Genesis and Sonic 1 was bundled at a $50 sort of lower price point. And so we

359
00:38:06,127 --> 00:38:09,228
considered that was kind of like the holiday sales war of 1991.

360
00:38:12,341 --> 00:38:14,223
So the result is... ... ... ... ... ...

361
00:38:18,747 --> 00:38:30,177
... ... ... ... ... So all of our...this to us means that all of our...

362
00:38:37,407 --> 00:38:44,551
blood, sweat, and tears, and everything that we put into building Sonic as a character, but really

363
00:38:46,012 --> 00:38:52,196
putting Sega out there, having that brand recognition, and being able to beat

364
00:38:53,817 --> 00:39:01,542
Nintendo, Super NES, and the Mario bundle meant a whole lot. It was something that we had hoped

365
00:39:01,602 --> 00:39:05,004
and wished for and worked hard towards, and it actually happened.

366
00:39:08,564 --> 00:39:12,646
Japanese interpretation So, here's a summary of our experience and

367
00:39:12,866 --> 00:39:15,547
learnings, but I think they can be applied to a lot of different things.

368
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:16,767
The first thing is...

369
00:39:35,126 --> 00:39:40,950
there's always going to be ways to compete with what you think are unbeatable opponents.

370
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:43,612
And the second one is making technology your ally.

371
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:46,974
I think new technology will be a very useful weapon for us to fight against the old generation.

372
00:40:02,757 --> 00:40:08,462
And what I mean by that is, you know, anyone can go out and try to make use of new technology,

373
00:40:08,582 --> 00:40:16,889
but more than that, I think it's a tool that can be used to sort of beat out an opponent

374
00:40:17,129 --> 00:40:20,832
that had always had the number one position up until that point.

375
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:28,298
It's more difficult for companies or people in that position to make that change happen.

376
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:35,382
new technology kind of becomes a weapon or a tool for those who want to go up for that challenge.

377
00:40:36,442 --> 00:40:39,964
And the third one is gathering allies, like getting a band together.

378
00:40:39,984 --> 00:40:41,904
We created this game by talking to each other about a lot of things.

379
00:40:56,487 --> 00:41:06,334
So, us, you know, we were a team, but individually we were very, I guess, opinionated and spoke our minds,

380
00:41:06,874 --> 00:41:14,740
and those moments, you know, you're speaking about what your ideas are, but we came together as a band.

381
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,723
It was like a band, someone would play a phrase, and someone would add something to it,

382
00:41:19,783 --> 00:41:22,405
and then we would work on it one after another.

383
00:41:30,552 --> 00:41:35,713
So in a way we were individually having these solo performances or solo acts,

384
00:41:36,253 --> 00:41:42,654
but once I projected my solo part, then someone else reacted to that, and then another person reacted to that.

385
00:41:43,194 --> 00:41:46,935
And there's infinite sort of possibilities if you look at it that way.

386
00:41:47,035 --> 00:41:54,457
Something that you can't imagine just by yourself will happen if you have other people come together.

387
00:41:55,524 --> 00:41:59,007
that are kind of having similar tastes and ideas and minds.

388
00:42:00,308 --> 00:42:05,131
So yeah, not just in games, but whatever you are pursuing or working on,

389
00:42:15,412 --> 00:42:19,754
I would strongly encourage that you guys come together as a band,

390
00:42:19,814 --> 00:42:24,976
start singing one phrase and then another person may step into it and add to that.

391
00:42:25,937 --> 00:42:33,000
It'll be something that will result in an unimaginable sort of ideas and results.

392
00:42:42,677 --> 00:42:46,238
Of course, Naka-san, but also the staff and the business,

393
00:42:46,338 --> 00:42:49,779
I think Sonic was born thanks to the power of the staff.

394
00:42:49,879 --> 00:42:53,600
I feel that it is important to bring together good friends

395
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,921
because the power of everyone is so great.

396
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:25,608
To add and maybe reiterate, you know, it's just us two speaking today, but obviously with Naka-san being a part of the team, it was, and not just Naka-san, other staff who made things happen, not just on the development side, also on the business and sort of sales side.

397
00:43:26,008 --> 00:43:32,493
Because we all got together as one big team, one big band, I think the energy was exponentially sort of...

398
00:43:33,704 --> 00:43:39,206
larger than what one person could have done or even a small amount of people could have done at that time.

399
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:46,949
So that energy and power that we had at that time was so strong and stronger than ever that we had

400
00:43:47,009 --> 00:43:53,131
experienced before and I think that really helped to attain and actually achieve our goals.

401
00:43:55,892 --> 00:43:56,472
That's it. Thank you.

402
00:44:11,293 --> 00:44:15,315
That was great. You should follow them both on Twitter if you don't already.

403
00:44:17,375 --> 00:44:22,337
They post a lot of good Sonic stuff. I'm gonna quickly get into some questions.

404
00:44:22,397 --> 00:44:31,460
It was really hard not to jump in in the middle. So first, was there any sense that you were working in a dream team at the time?

405
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,600
We think of it now, but...

406
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:40,239
The Hime no Kyogen.

407
00:44:40,419 --> 00:44:42,640
Yes, but,

408
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:45,621
Mr. Naka was the best,

409
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:46,141
the most,

410
00:44:46,461 --> 00:44:50,702
the number one programmer in the department.

411
00:44:50,762 --> 00:44:52,682
A genius programmer.

412
00:44:52,722 --> 00:44:53,983
He was a genius programmer,

413
00:44:54,003 --> 00:44:56,063
so my goal was to work with him.

414
00:44:56,103 --> 00:44:56,963
So, in that sense,

415
00:44:57,003 --> 00:44:59,144
when I teamed up with Mr. Naka,

416
00:45:12,746 --> 00:45:17,649
So, I don't know if Dream Team is the label or name that I was even thinking of.

417
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:24,954
Rather than that way of thinking, you know, Naka-san at that time was already a genius

418
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:25,615
programmer.

419
00:45:25,655 --> 00:45:29,878
He was basically our number one guy, an important figure at the company.

420
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:37,539
all this time my goal was to somehow figure out a way to work with him and to team up and if that

421
00:45:37,659 --> 00:45:43,202
happens then I know that something really good will come out of it. So that's really the only

422
00:45:43,322 --> 00:45:46,024
kind of thought and goal I had in mind at that time.

423
00:45:46,044 --> 00:45:51,807
If you team up with Mr. Naka, you can gain strength within the club.

424
00:46:03,863 --> 00:46:11,245
And not only do I get to work with Naka-san, but what comes with that structure is that

425
00:46:11,365 --> 00:46:16,627
you have other talented people who will end up contributing or are already contributing

426
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:21,789
with what's going on in conjunction with what Naka-san is working on.

427
00:46:22,089 --> 00:46:23,769
And that's where Yas Hara-san...

428
00:46:25,212 --> 00:46:32,695
comes into kind of the picture for me because from a design point of view he was already doing

429
00:46:32,755 --> 00:46:38,657
great work so it was a win-win for me I get to work with someone that I wanted to work with

430
00:46:38,777 --> 00:46:43,898
all this time and then comes all these other talented people on the team.

431
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:47,500
At that time I was working with Mark Cerny.

432
00:46:52,071 --> 00:46:57,693
He's a genius programmer, so I was totally satisfied.

433
00:46:59,453 --> 00:47:01,594
You can't look down on him.

434
00:47:01,734 --> 00:47:08,416
But I thought it was interesting and I wanted to make a character game.

435
00:47:08,436 --> 00:47:16,099
So, hearing that is nice, but I was also working with someone who I considered another genius, which was Mark Cerny.

436
00:47:16,539 --> 00:47:18,780
He popped in earlier a little bit.

437
00:47:19,901 --> 00:47:22,422
He's on a whole different level, a whole other level.

438
00:47:22,562 --> 00:47:27,245
So I thought I was already surrounded by all these geniuses.

439
00:47:27,365 --> 00:47:33,029
And then I hear about Oshima-san being able to work with Naka-san.

440
00:47:33,069 --> 00:47:40,173
So I actually wanted to kind of work more a little bit on the character design side of things.

441
00:47:41,194 --> 00:47:45,416
So I guess the end result is that it was a really good team that came together at that time.

442
00:47:46,195 --> 00:47:54,359
And how much did Yuji Naka's practice of getting the most out of the Mega Drive influence the game design and the game's creation?

443
00:47:55,399 --> 00:47:57,580
He made everything for us.

444
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:01,502
He made everything, so he made anything we wanted.

445
00:48:01,602 --> 00:48:03,783
It was like a dream.

446
00:48:03,983 --> 00:48:06,824
We were able to work with a programmer like that.

447
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:15,028
So the truth is, is that he rarely said like he would take on any kind of ideas and wishes.

448
00:48:15,697 --> 00:48:18,239
he'll be like, okay, I'll make that happen.

449
00:48:18,939 --> 00:48:21,881
And that in itself was like a super ideal,

450
00:48:21,962 --> 00:48:24,223
almost dreamlike scenario because he's like,

451
00:48:24,363 --> 00:48:27,125
okay, I'll see what I can do and I'll make it happen.

452
00:48:27,225 --> 00:48:29,507
So that was the environment that we were in at that time.

453
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:31,868
Little follow up to Oshima-san.

454
00:48:32,969 --> 00:48:38,073
You once told me that when making Sega,

455
00:48:38,273 --> 00:48:41,535
when making Sonic CD, during the time transitions,

456
00:48:42,856 --> 00:48:44,497
they had to put in a loading screen.

457
00:48:45,437 --> 00:48:50,760
but you wanted it originally to be continuous and you told me Naka-san could have done it.

458
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,341
I just want to...

459
00:48:53,361 --> 00:48:58,623
I wanted to do it in a seamless way, but Naka-san definitely did it.

460
00:48:58,783 --> 00:48:59,504
Right?

461
00:49:00,644 --> 00:49:03,725
I can't say.

462
00:49:03,805 --> 00:49:05,586
I can't say.

463
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:08,427
I'd rather not comment.

464
00:49:08,568 --> 00:49:09,648
Okay.

465
00:49:09,748 --> 00:49:11,889
I'd rather not comment.

466
00:49:11,969 --> 00:49:14,110
If you read Gama Sutra, you will see that he did that.

467
00:49:16,423 --> 00:49:18,564
Can you talk about the creation of the music for a bit?

468
00:49:19,464 --> 00:49:22,066
I want to know how you got involved with discussions with

469
00:49:22,766 --> 00:49:25,767
Masato Nakamura, who was from Dreams Come True,

470
00:49:25,787 --> 00:49:31,290
a famous Japanese pop band. So I heard that he was just given static screenshots

471
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:31,830
of the game

472
00:49:32,311 --> 00:49:35,852
and then he composed his music on keyboards and sent it in on a demo tape.

473
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:44,080
I've only met her once.

474
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:48,963
But just by looking at her, I feel that she's a child.

475
00:49:48,983 --> 00:49:50,985
That's what I think, especially as a Japanese person.

476
00:49:51,005 --> 00:49:53,427
But she's also very popular with women,

477
00:49:53,547 --> 00:49:56,709
and I thought, she's definitely not a child.

478
00:49:56,729 --> 00:49:59,211
I tried my best to explain that to her.

479
00:50:10,248 --> 00:50:16,570
So the truth is, is that I only met Nakamura-san once this entire time, or as we were working

480
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:20,571
on this song and asking him to create the song.

481
00:50:40,781 --> 00:50:44,662
There are a few things that I guess we were very careful of.

482
00:50:44,842 --> 00:50:48,443
If we had just sent or shared an image of the character,

483
00:50:48,923 --> 00:50:51,863
we feared that he would take it as more of a,

484
00:50:53,404 --> 00:50:55,904
let's say like a child or a kid cartoon,

485
00:50:56,084 --> 00:51:01,325
you know, a younger age demographic targeted game or IP.

486
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:04,246
So we wanted to make sure that that was not

487
00:51:04,286 --> 00:51:06,747
the first impression that we gave or he took.

488
00:51:07,278 --> 00:51:12,699
and that we wanted this character to appeal to a wider range of audience, even including

489
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:21,202
females and you know a higher age range, adult females. So that's one thing that we did for sure

490
00:51:21,462 --> 00:51:28,384
and then also because he was part of Dreams Come True, which is a very popular Japanese band,

491
00:51:28,924 --> 00:51:33,525
we had this kind of exchange or promise that by him working on

492
00:51:34,306 --> 00:51:40,111
creating a song for Sonic that it wouldn't devalue the popularity of his band,

493
00:51:41,052 --> 00:51:46,056
just because, oh, he's now out making songs for game characters or games.

494
00:51:46,917 --> 00:51:48,898
So that was kind of the exchange that we had,

495
00:51:49,479 --> 00:51:55,864
and that's kind of as far as my relationship or communication goes

496
00:51:55,964 --> 00:51:58,146
in trying to convince him to work on a song.

497
00:52:04,962 --> 00:52:13,507
Yes, he did compose it on a keyboard away from Sega and send it in on a cassette tape.

498
00:52:13,607 --> 00:52:18,311
And then they interpreted it there into the FM synthesis.

499
00:52:19,451 --> 00:52:23,834
And what was the process of creating the dot art in the game?

500
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:26,035
You had some specific programs and hardware?

501
00:52:26,456 --> 00:52:27,156
Yes, the dot art.

502
00:52:30,918 --> 00:52:33,160
The digitizer was in a wooden box about this size.

503
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,663
I would click it with a light pen.

504
00:52:37,683 --> 00:52:40,486
And then I would zoom in and out using this monitor.

505
00:52:58,721 --> 00:53:00,841
I think the action speaks louder than words.

506
00:53:01,442 --> 00:53:04,042
But it was a touch screen, right?

507
00:53:04,122 --> 00:53:10,284
Yeah, they called it a digitizer and it was like this pretty giant kind of box.

508
00:53:10,804 --> 00:53:14,545
And so I would be basically clicking, touching here.

509
00:53:15,055 --> 00:53:20,659
and then there was a monitor on the side, so I would have to kind of test check what is going on here,

510
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:25,322
looking at it, and then just one by one, it was a very tedious sort of process.

511
00:53:27,684 --> 00:53:33,028
So here's a fun thing that we came up with for you.

512
00:53:33,988 --> 00:53:37,251
The both of them are going to draw their...

513
00:53:42,117 --> 00:53:47,579
They're going to draw their individual interpretations of Sonic right now.

514
00:53:55,741 --> 00:53:59,663
Yeah.

515
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:04,804
I don't know if we can get a, I don't know, hands, but where do you think I start with?

516
00:54:05,084 --> 00:54:07,765
Yeah, what part of the character do you think I start with?

517
00:54:08,105 --> 00:54:10,426
I'll ask, do you think he starts with the head?

518
00:54:14,179 --> 00:54:15,580
Or the shoes?

519
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,561
The body?

520
00:54:18,702 --> 00:54:20,322
Or the eyes?

521
00:54:20,362 --> 00:54:22,003
Well, eyes is right.

522
00:54:22,223 --> 00:54:25,045
While he draws, I will ask Yasuhara-san,

523
00:54:26,045 --> 00:54:31,428
can you quickly describe your...

524
00:54:40,575 --> 00:54:48,321
the main points of your game design philosophy, because it has become so solid in recent years.

525
00:55:10,504 --> 00:55:16,587
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA So maybe I guess on a pretty high level,

526
00:55:16,607 --> 00:55:22,151
but my game design philosophies, one of them is I'm constantly looking at things or I guess

527
00:55:39,714 --> 00:55:46,779
triggered by things, what attracts our human maybe eyes or just humans in general. So,

528
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:51,262
you know, whether it's in just an everyday environment or moving objects, it's like,

529
00:55:51,362 --> 00:55:56,525
what are we attracted to? What is appealing to us? That's what I'm always thinking of.

530
00:55:57,486 --> 00:56:06,092
Yeah, he has a talk that you can see from Digital Dragons in Poland, where he really outlines...

531
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:12,834
Ah!

532
00:56:18,238 --> 00:56:19,239
We should save this.

533
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:20,240
Yeah.

534
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:23,402
Save this, then you know.

535
00:56:23,522 --> 00:56:24,343
Yeah, save that.

536
00:56:24,983 --> 00:56:32,789
But you can watch his talk, and it goes through each step of his philosophy for game design

537
00:56:32,949 --> 00:56:36,391
through a Unity tutorial that he made.

538
00:56:36,807 --> 00:56:38,928
And it just starts from like, here's a bouncing thing.

539
00:56:39,268 --> 00:56:39,968
Now make it red.

540
00:56:40,368 --> 00:56:41,168
Now make it move.

541
00:56:41,589 --> 00:56:42,469
Now change the physics.

542
00:56:42,489 --> 00:56:43,590
So there are three bouncing things,

543
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:44,730
and they're doing something weird.

544
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:46,351
And if you drop something into the situation,

545
00:56:46,391 --> 00:56:46,971
everything changes.

546
00:56:47,091 --> 00:56:48,372
It's really like, it's great.

547
00:56:48,412 --> 00:56:50,232
This pen is a little weird.

548
00:56:50,352 --> 00:56:52,853
So now it's Yasuhara's turn to do it.

549
00:56:53,674 --> 00:56:54,214
Let's see.

550
00:56:54,574 --> 00:56:56,855
So in the meantime, I will ask Oshima-san.

551
00:56:57,075 --> 00:56:57,435
Oshima-san?

552
00:56:57,515 --> 00:56:57,636
Huh?

553
00:56:57,696 --> 00:56:57,836
Huh?

554
00:56:57,856 --> 00:56:58,176
Huh?

555
00:56:58,296 --> 00:56:58,436
Huh?

556
00:56:58,476 --> 00:56:58,596
Huh?

557
00:56:58,656 --> 00:56:58,836
Huh?

558
00:56:58,876 --> 00:56:59,036
Huh?

559
00:56:59,296 --> 00:57:00,757
I don't have much time.

560
00:57:01,097 --> 00:57:03,038
I've got to be quick.

561
00:57:03,078 --> 00:57:03,198
Yay!

562
00:57:03,218 --> 00:57:03,638
Yeah.

563
00:57:03,678 --> 00:57:03,818
Yay!

564
00:57:03,898 --> 00:57:04,018
Yay!

565
00:57:04,118 --> 00:57:04,218
Yay!

566
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:04,458
Yay!

567
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:05,339
Yay!

568
00:57:06,219 --> 00:57:14,604
Oshima-san, which anime or animation were most influential on your animation creation?

569
00:57:15,345 --> 00:57:16,326
It looks very Disney.

570
00:57:16,426 --> 00:57:17,607
It's the one that influenced me the most.

571
00:57:17,647 --> 00:57:18,967
Yeah, it's very Disney.

572
00:57:19,308 --> 00:57:19,948
It's Disney, right?

573
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:25,252
Yasuhara-san, what is that?

574
00:57:25,272 --> 00:57:25,592
What is it?

575
00:57:25,632 --> 00:57:27,053
It's Lupin the Third.

576
00:57:27,093 --> 00:57:29,715
Oh, Lupin the Third.

577
00:57:29,975 --> 00:57:30,836
Oh, Lupin the Third.

578
00:57:30,876 --> 00:57:31,256
Yeah.

579
00:57:32,137 --> 00:57:32,917
Lupin the Third.

580
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:33,758
That makes sense.

581
00:57:39,014 --> 00:57:39,374
Yeah.

582
00:57:41,155 --> 00:57:41,675
Good buddies.

583
00:57:47,898 --> 00:57:56,863
Okay, we have time for like two questions maybe, so if you line up to those mics, we

584
00:57:56,883 --> 00:57:57,503
can take them.

585
00:57:57,583 --> 00:57:58,183
All right, you're first.

586
00:57:58,223 --> 00:57:58,763
You stood right up.

587
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:01,131
Great panel, thank you very much for your time.

588
00:58:01,271 --> 00:58:03,813
Real quick, what lessons did you take

589
00:58:03,913 --> 00:58:06,294
from the mascot kind of characters

590
00:58:06,334 --> 00:58:09,217
that came specifically from Sega, Alex Kidd and the like?

591
00:58:09,257 --> 00:58:11,218
I can't imagine you're working in a vacuum

592
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:12,399
before coming forward and saying,

593
00:58:12,459 --> 00:58:14,460
all right, we're trying essentially again.

594
00:58:14,561 --> 00:58:15,882
And that might not have been your attitude

595
00:58:15,902 --> 00:58:16,682
from where you're coming from,

596
00:58:16,742 --> 00:58:19,664
but just curious about that part of the generation process.

597
00:58:19,764 --> 00:58:20,005
Thank you.

598
00:58:20,385 --> 00:58:21,005
I like Alex Kidd.

599
00:58:21,366 --> 00:58:25,329
I was like a little, it was hard to hear.

600
00:58:25,749 --> 00:58:28,351
So the question was, what influence did you take from

601
00:58:29,368 --> 00:58:33,851
existing SEGA IP characters like Alex Kidd, if anything.

602
00:58:56,180 --> 00:59:00,288
Yeah, the Flickies.

603
00:59:00,368 --> 00:59:02,592
The Flickies are in Sonic, and they took some influence from that.

604
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:04,937
Yeah, they took some influence from that, but...

605
00:59:05,962 --> 00:59:11,465
They're like, really, nothing in particular from the previous characters that Sega had at that time.

606
00:59:11,505 --> 00:59:14,087
This was like really from scratch.

607
00:59:14,127 --> 00:59:17,429
It was like a white, you know, board ready for us.

608
00:59:17,629 --> 00:59:20,511
So far as I know, it was like, let's redefine Sega.

609
00:59:20,571 --> 00:59:20,831
Right.

610
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:22,833
Okay, we'll go to this side.

611
00:59:22,953 --> 00:59:23,333
Yeah.

612
00:59:23,413 --> 00:59:24,694
Hello, I'll ask for the panel.

613
00:59:25,134 --> 00:59:34,661
Just really quickly, how do you feel that while Sonic was popular worldwide, it completely exploded in America?

614
00:59:34,681 --> 00:59:34,741
And

615
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:41,727
in Japan was popular but not as much. Do you feel that you may need it to, or looking back,

616
00:59:41,767 --> 00:59:45,972
do you feel that you could change something or maybe you did something different?

617
00:59:53,385 --> 00:59:56,929
I don't know. Basically, I made them for the United States.

618
00:59:56,949 --> 00:59:59,631
I tried to make the taste similar to the American taste.

619
00:59:59,651 --> 01:00:00,252
I watched cartoons.

620
01:00:00,272 --> 01:00:02,874
To be honest, it was different from the Japanese taste.

621
01:00:14,462 --> 01:00:19,344
So our target from the beginning was to actually create this character that would appeal to the

622
01:00:19,404 --> 01:00:24,667
North American audience. So that was already part of the process. We weren't looking at

623
01:00:25,847 --> 01:00:31,950
trying to appeal to the entire world. On top of that, I had mentioned in our presentation that

624
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:38,093
Oshima-san was very into like the airplane nose art, something that had a lot to do with

625
01:00:38,373 --> 01:00:43,275
U.S.-based, American-based kind of culture at that time, or of that era.

626
01:00:44,866 --> 01:00:50,889
I think it was natural for us to have come up with something that would appeal to the North American audience rather than the Japanese audience.

627
01:00:51,489 --> 01:00:51,809
Thank you.

628
01:00:53,090 --> 01:01:03,275
I cannot leave this room today without mentioning that I think the biggest, I guess, factor is that Sega of America,

629
01:01:03,295 --> 01:01:05,436
I think the biggest factor is that Sega of America,

630
01:01:15,863 --> 01:01:20,146
We're so confident in what we're about to do and what we're about to embark on.

631
01:01:20,346 --> 01:01:26,430
And so the fact that they were they were they trusted us and believed in us and our work,

632
01:01:27,331 --> 01:01:32,075
I think was something that kind of validated was validation for us.

633
01:01:32,175 --> 01:01:36,698
But then they took that and really worked it, you know, into their strategy.

634
01:01:36,778 --> 01:01:42,122
So that probably had a lot to do with how popular Sonic became out here.

635
01:01:42,142 --> 01:01:43,123
Thank you.

636
01:01:43,918 --> 01:01:47,402
Okay, so it's 4.30, we gotta wrap this up,

637
01:01:47,602 --> 01:01:49,525
but thank you all so much for coming,

638
01:01:49,805 --> 01:01:54,190
and we'll try to go to the wrap-up room.
