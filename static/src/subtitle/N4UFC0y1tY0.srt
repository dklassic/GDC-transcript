1
00:00:25,556 --> 00:00:26,137
You're

2
00:01:06,262 --> 00:01:09,543
All those company logo bumpers are pulled from this year's

3
00:01:09,583 --> 00:01:10,683
crop of IGF games.

4
00:01:14,705 --> 00:01:15,425
I'm Ben Affati.

5
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:16,486
I'm Zach Gage.

6
00:01:17,106 --> 00:01:20,347
And if you're not familiar with our work, you're about to be.

7
00:01:20,387 --> 00:01:21,908
This is a really personal talk.

8
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:26,810
In preparing this talk, I went through and looked

9
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,931
at the 500 or so IGF trailers that are on YouTube

10
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:31,051
for this year's IGF.

11
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,860
I wanted to see how hard it would

12
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,341
be to figure out who the developers were on each game.

13
00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:38,803
So I looked to see if their names were in the trailer,

14
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:41,465
the metadata under the trailer, or if they

15
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:43,266
had a link to the website, I clicked through

16
00:01:43,346 --> 00:01:45,767
and went to see if their names were there as well.

17
00:01:45,787 --> 00:01:47,968
And these are the numbers for 100 or so

18
00:01:48,249 --> 00:01:50,130
of this year's IGF games.

19
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,272
Less than a quarter of them have the developer names

20
00:01:53,592 --> 00:01:55,953
anywhere near the trailer, and less than half

21
00:01:56,394 --> 00:01:57,975
have the names on the game website.

22
00:02:01,065 --> 00:02:02,686
The numbers are significantly lower

23
00:02:02,726 --> 00:02:05,989
if you limit it to games that are on sale for money,

24
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:07,490
or that have a Steam wish list page,

25
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,771
or some other kind of thing that's

26
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:10,312
indicating it's going to be on sale for money.

27
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:16,316
So my takeaway from that is that indie game developers don't

28
00:02:16,356 --> 00:02:18,517
like their names to be too visible on their game,

29
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,399
especially if they're planning to sell it for money.

30
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,022
They do like putting company branding very, very visibly

31
00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:26,503
on their game.

32
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,784
That's a pretty high horse, Bennett.

33
00:02:28,884 --> 00:02:30,708
Aren't you kind of guilty of this as well?

34
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,114
Yeah, that's fair, that's fair.

35
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:34,955
I've been part of that culture.

36
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,278
This is a game I worked on called Sports Friends.

37
00:02:39,298 --> 00:02:41,299
This is what you see when you load up Sports Friends.

38
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,600
There's a logo, yeah, a company logo.

39
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:48,763
And then there's five more logos, six logos all up.

40
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:50,985
One of them is for a person's name.

41
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:53,046
The others are company logos.

42
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:55,807
In fact, that co-op logo isn't even a company logo

43
00:02:55,847 --> 00:02:56,928
because I don't have a company.

44
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,812
It's just me pretending I have a company and a company logo

45
00:03:00,912 --> 00:03:02,633
and putting that at the start of the game.

46
00:03:02,653 --> 00:03:05,436
And I can't even tell you why I did that,

47
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:06,757
rather than putting my name there.

48
00:03:06,817 --> 00:03:09,319
It just seemed like it was the thing to do.

49
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,520
But hold on a second, Zach.

50
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,902
What about your games prior to this year?

51
00:03:15,023 --> 00:03:15,403
You got me.

52
00:03:16,204 --> 00:03:16,584
That's true.

53
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:19,667
I did basically hide behind this totally impenetrable logo

54
00:03:19,747 --> 00:03:20,807
for a very long time.

55
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,210
But since last year, all my games look like this.

56
00:03:26,352 --> 00:03:28,894
All right, so some of you are probably starting to think,

57
00:03:28,954 --> 00:03:31,937
well, I have a really good reason for using a company

58
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:33,219
logo instead of my own name.

59
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,984
So all right, let's talk about some of those reasons

60
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:40,046
why you might want to do that.

61
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:42,068
Some of these reasons are really good reasons.

62
00:03:42,749 --> 00:03:43,550
First of all, the big one.

63
00:03:44,511 --> 00:03:45,792
Maybe you just hate your name.

64
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:47,213
I like your name, Bennett.

65
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:48,114
Exactly.

66
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,053
Maybe your given name sounds ridiculous or fake.

67
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,715
Maybe you've spent your whole life feeling embarrassed

68
00:03:54,815 --> 00:03:56,317
when you introduce yourself.

69
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:59,160
You know, it's possible to imagine that happening,

70
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,301
hypothetically.

71
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:03,604
But above feeling embarrassed,

72
00:04:03,624 --> 00:04:04,985
there could be a good practical reason

73
00:04:05,045 --> 00:04:06,026
why you don't want to use your name.

74
00:04:06,587 --> 00:04:08,088
Charlotte Bronte, like many others,

75
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:10,411
had to deal with a widespread prejudice

76
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:11,872
against female authors,

77
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:13,794
and she did that by using a male pen name.

78
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:20,070
And there's a really long history in the arts of people choosing a different name to represent their work,

79
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:23,912
including pen names, stage names, and other names of choice,

80
00:04:23,952 --> 00:04:27,474
like preferred names or romanizations of non-English names.

81
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:32,018
Lewis Carroll, Slash, Helen Mirren, Cactus

82
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,581
are all names that were chosen by the artist,

83
00:04:35,382 --> 00:04:36,483
and they always use those names

84
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:38,144
in connection with their creative work.

85
00:04:38,665 --> 00:04:40,166
Helen Mirren's birth name's a little harder

86
00:04:40,186 --> 00:04:41,047
to pronounce in English.

87
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:44,991
Lewis Carroll had a academic writing career as well

88
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:46,553
and wanted to differentiate his creative work.

89
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:49,861
Slash was just given this really cool name by a friend.

90
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:52,565
And I think there's just like a million good reasons

91
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:54,748
to use the name of your own choosing rather than your given name.

92
00:04:55,049 --> 00:04:58,573
So as long as the name that you're using identifies a person

93
00:04:59,034 --> 00:04:59,875
rather than a company,

94
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,918
we are 100% on board with that.

95
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:03,460
We're behind you.

96
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:07,146
And it's also really important to acknowledge at this point,

97
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:10,607
not everybody is going to feel safe being identified at all

98
00:05:11,188 --> 00:05:13,549
in their creative work, regardless of whether it's

99
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,509
through a company name or through an individual name.

100
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:18,410
So if you need your work to be totally anonymous,

101
00:05:19,131 --> 00:05:21,692
that's a great reason not to put your name or your company

102
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:22,252
logo on it.

103
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:23,572
And we're not questioning that at all, just

104
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:24,513
to be totally clear.

105
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:32,602
If you're working as part of a team, probably the biggest issue with putting names on your

106
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:34,443
game is having to think about who gets credit.

107
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:37,765
And this is an extremely understandable concern.

108
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:41,767
Working with other people is hard enough without having to bring credit into the mix.

109
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:47,170
But that said, if your game is successful at all, this is an issue that probably will

110
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:47,851
come up anyway.

111
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:51,113
So it's worth at least looking down that road in advance.

112
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:57,035
Something I've learned about credit over the past couple of years is that it really exists in two pieces.

113
00:05:58,176 --> 00:06:04,519
One of the pieces is how your team chooses to credit itself, and then the second piece is how the world chooses to credit you.

114
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:11,021
And the first one of those you have absolute control over, but the second one you can only really hope to influence it.

115
00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:14,359
And this can make giving credit particularly complicated,

116
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,821
especially in situations where members of the team

117
00:06:16,861 --> 00:06:18,763
have different levels of public exposure.

118
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:21,004
There's no real simple solution to this.

119
00:06:21,364 --> 00:06:23,586
It's just good to go into this process being aware of it.

120
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:26,148
For example, this is the opening screen

121
00:06:26,528 --> 00:06:30,011
of Ridiculous Fishing, a game that Greg Woland and I worked

122
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:32,833
on that very few people know that we worked on.

123
00:06:33,653 --> 00:06:36,375
Maybe people in this room, but out of this room,

124
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:37,076
very few people.

125
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:42,181
And that's despite putting this title screen up first,

126
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:44,243
despite Rami and JW working really hard

127
00:06:44,283 --> 00:06:46,466
to make sure that we were credited in press pieces.

128
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:49,209
We did what we could to make it clear who was involved,

129
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:50,730
but there was only so much we could do,

130
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,272
and that is totally fine with us.

131
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:54,514
We knew that that was going to be an issue going in.

132
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,011
One time I was at a festival exhibiting Multi Bowl,

133
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:02,852
a game I made with the amazing, talented designer AP Thompson.

134
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:05,073
And right next door, the game next door

135
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:08,253
was stuffed by Jenny Jiao Xia, who

136
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:12,134
was showing The Glitch, a game that she made that was also

137
00:07:12,274 --> 00:07:13,935
designed and coded by AP Thompson.

138
00:07:14,555 --> 00:07:17,116
And somehow his name had been left off the printed signs

139
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:18,356
for both games.

140
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,316
We were horrified.

141
00:07:19,336 --> 00:07:22,077
And Jenny and I wound up finding Sharpies

142
00:07:22,157 --> 00:07:25,218
and modifying the signs by hand at the last second.

143
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:29,535
You can see Jenny did a much better job than me.

144
00:07:31,277 --> 00:07:32,918
But in fact, that had become a pattern

145
00:07:33,258 --> 00:07:35,199
for both of those games, even though AP

146
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:36,900
was clearly credited in both.

147
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:40,843
So to be clear, nobody in this example or in Zach's example

148
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:41,884
was acting in bad faith.

149
00:07:42,404 --> 00:07:44,745
Not the developers, not the festival organizers,

150
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:45,466
not the press.

151
00:07:46,627 --> 00:07:47,747
Everyone was trying to get it right,

152
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:50,429
and yet it still doesn't always turn out how you want.

153
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:52,370
So yeah, we've both had experiences

154
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:53,891
where this was really hard to get right.

155
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:57,235
But it's not impossible to get it right.

156
00:07:57,635 --> 00:08:00,339
This year, I worked on a game called Ape Out

157
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,922
as part of a three-person team.

158
00:08:02,563 --> 00:08:04,065
And we approached the problem this way,

159
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:06,689
both in the trailer and in the beginning of the game.

160
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:26,780
So obviously, the first person in a list like that

161
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,280
is going to get more visibility, which

162
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,160
happens to be what we wanted in this case.

163
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:32,781
But we've actually found that all three of us

164
00:08:33,101 --> 00:08:35,902
are mentioned in the majority of press articles and tweets

165
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:36,382
and so on.

166
00:08:36,962 --> 00:08:38,422
And maybe that's just good luck.

167
00:08:38,462 --> 00:08:39,263
Maybe that's a bit of good luck.

168
00:08:39,363 --> 00:08:42,283
But it's not always easy to control

169
00:08:43,364 --> 00:08:44,844
who gets credit for a game.

170
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:46,585
But one thing is totally for sure.

171
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:50,105
If you don't put any names on your game,

172
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:51,846
then nobody gets any credit.

173
00:08:52,525 --> 00:08:55,027
Which is fairer, sure, that is totally fair.

174
00:08:55,087 --> 00:08:57,809
But it's fair in the way that it's totally fair if nobody

175
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:58,789
in the world gets any food.

176
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,891
And I think it's definitely possible to do

177
00:09:01,931 --> 00:09:02,651
a little better than that.

178
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:06,354
OK, next reason people give.

179
00:09:06,774 --> 00:09:08,635
I know a lot of indie developers have this idea

180
00:09:08,655 --> 00:09:10,536
that they're going to use this company logo and this company

181
00:09:10,576 --> 00:09:13,678
name from their trailer for a bunch of different games.

182
00:09:13,718 --> 00:09:15,139
And eventually growing their business

183
00:09:15,619 --> 00:09:18,561
into a giant brand with a large number of employees.

184
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:21,183
Like, dress for the job you want, not the job you have.

185
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,221
And you might think, you know, Activision started as an indie

186
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:27,642
game developer in 1979, four people.

187
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,123
And you might think something like this.

188
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:33,824
Well, if they had to call their first game David Crane's

189
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:37,165
Fishing Derby instead of Activision Fishing Derby, it

190
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:38,866
would've been much harder for his co-founders

191
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:39,666
to grow the company.

192
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:41,887
After all, Crane didn't work on every game.

193
00:09:42,507 --> 00:09:45,468
And he departed seven years later and took any artistic

194
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:47,268
cachet that his name might have had with him.

195
00:09:48,317 --> 00:09:49,898
while Activision continues to grow

196
00:09:49,938 --> 00:09:52,399
into this huge corporate brand.

197
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,681
So maybe your company, Awesomeware Games,

198
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:57,142
is going to be like Activision.

199
00:09:57,162 --> 00:09:58,483
And you don't want to hitch your fortune

200
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,424
to any single person's name.

201
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:04,206
And what I want to say about that is that's totally valid.

202
00:10:04,806 --> 00:10:07,708
But I want to caution you that it is numerically very

203
00:10:07,748 --> 00:10:08,248
unlikely.

204
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:11,170
If you take all the game companies on MobiGames, which

205
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,691
is thousands of companies over four or five decades,

206
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:17,913
the median number of games that each company worked on is one.

207
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,325
I did the analysis.

208
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:24,046
MobiGames is missing as well.

209
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:26,827
A lot of the indie companies in this room

210
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:28,108
and that have come before.

211
00:10:28,448 --> 00:10:30,569
But I'm willing to bet that if we took all the indie games

212
00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:32,989
that are missing from MobiGames and rolled them into this data,

213
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:35,250
the median would be even more one.

214
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:35,330
Wow.

215
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:35,410
Wow.

216
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,510
Wow.

217
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:38,031
Wow.

218
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:40,892
That means your company is more likely to work on one game

219
00:10:41,012 --> 00:10:42,172
than any other number of games.

220
00:10:42,212 --> 00:10:44,913
And in fact, more than half of all companies

221
00:10:45,053 --> 00:10:46,714
have shipped only one game.

222
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:49,584
If you form a company and you release a great game

223
00:10:49,604 --> 00:10:51,886
and you attach all the visibility and all of the respect,

224
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:54,909
all the kudos, all the press to the company

225
00:10:55,249 --> 00:10:56,590
instead of to the person who made it

226
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,832
or the people who made it, and then you fold the company,

227
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:01,095
all that work building the brand just vanishes.

228
00:11:01,615 --> 00:11:03,837
Meanwhile, you as a person will most likely to go on

229
00:11:04,137 --> 00:11:06,580
and work on many more than one game in your career.

230
00:11:08,477 --> 00:11:10,578
So you might be thinking, well, of course,

231
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:13,639
there are strong, identifiable company brands in indie games.

232
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:16,000
Zach already mentioned Blambia, who

233
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,202
have been releasing about a game a year for about 10 years.

234
00:11:20,302 --> 00:11:23,064
Sockpop have released 32 games as a collective

235
00:11:23,164 --> 00:11:24,224
in the past three years.

236
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,725
And their body of work has this really, really clear

237
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:27,806
artistic identity.

238
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:30,407
So yeah, if you buck the trend and you release more than one

239
00:11:30,447 --> 00:11:33,169
game, you can get some value out of the company name,

240
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:35,390
both artistically and in terms of branding.

241
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,515
But the odds are you're going to fold the company

242
00:11:38,535 --> 00:11:41,216
after you launch one game.

243
00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:43,957
So you might want to think about at least sharing

244
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:46,777
credit between your name and the company brand.

245
00:11:49,198 --> 00:11:51,018
If you're a modest person, you might

246
00:11:51,098 --> 00:11:53,019
feel like signing your games is just gross.

247
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:54,799
I can relate to this.

248
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,220
So true story.

249
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,121
Before I released Getting Over It,

250
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:03,022
I was trying to convince Zach that Sage Solitaire should

251
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:05,122
be called Gage Solitaire.

252
00:12:06,706 --> 00:12:08,167
Sage Solitaire doesn't mean anything.

253
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:09,507
It's meaningless.

254
00:12:10,568 --> 00:12:13,149
But he said no on the grounds that it seemed too egotistical.

255
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:14,270
And it did.

256
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:15,790
It still seems gross to me.

257
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:17,911
But I think that's kind of the point, right?

258
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:23,514
For some reason, naming my game Gage Solitaire is gross.

259
00:12:24,855 --> 00:12:27,776
But saying Sage Solitaire, a game by Zach Gage,

260
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:28,877
feels totally fine to me.

261
00:12:29,257 --> 00:12:30,197
I don't know why.

262
00:12:30,898 --> 00:12:32,338
And I think, hold on.

263
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:37,191
I think that's kind of the nuance that we're asking from you here, right?

264
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:40,992
We're not standing up here saying that you need to do something that makes you feel bad.

265
00:12:41,872 --> 00:12:45,714
We're inviting you to engage with something that you might have not engaged with because

266
00:12:45,774 --> 00:12:46,914
it made you uncomfortable.

267
00:12:47,194 --> 00:12:51,416
We're saying, let's greet this discomfort head on and try to find something meaningful

268
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:54,277
and personal, something that feels good, something that works for you.

269
00:12:55,217 --> 00:12:57,718
Otherwise, you're just settling for the default.

270
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:00,239
And whenever you settle for the default,

271
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:02,940
it's worth thinking about where that default came from

272
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:03,901
and what it means.

273
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:09,823
All right, so let's take a few minutes to talk about that.

274
00:13:09,843 --> 00:13:13,025
It's easy to lose sight of where our traditions come from.

275
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:14,225
And sometimes when you really look

276
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:15,866
at the history of a tradition, you

277
00:13:15,906 --> 00:13:20,448
might wonder why we're continuing it year over year.

278
00:13:22,357 --> 00:13:26,138
In the 1970s, as Atari moved from arcade manufacturing

279
00:13:26,178 --> 00:13:28,458
into console manufacturing, it quite famously

280
00:13:28,538 --> 00:13:31,639
began to eliminate the designers' names from their games

281
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:32,560
and from the packaging.

282
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,861
The Atari logo would be listed prominently on the packaging,

283
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:38,461
but none of the developers' names were ever mentioned.

284
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:41,542
And that very quickly became the industry standard here

285
00:13:41,562 --> 00:13:42,122
in the USA.

286
00:13:43,883 --> 00:13:45,964
Warren Robinette, the designer of Adventure,

287
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:48,124
invented the idea of the Easter egg

288
00:13:48,304 --> 00:13:51,085
as a kind of low-key rebellion against that policy.

289
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,152
In that game, if you find an invisible single pixel object

290
00:13:55,212 --> 00:13:57,913
and you take it and three other objects to a particular room

291
00:13:57,953 --> 00:14:00,495
and pass through the wall, you get to this secret room.

292
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,476
And he hid his name.

293
00:14:02,596 --> 00:14:04,817
Like, the reward is you get to see the developer's name.

294
00:14:05,697 --> 00:14:09,520
And Warren Robinette knew that Atari wouldn't see that.

295
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,301
They wouldn't find it until all of the cartridges

296
00:14:11,341 --> 00:14:12,861
had been printed and sold.

297
00:14:13,662 --> 00:14:14,662
And he quit his job.

298
00:14:16,143 --> 00:14:17,224
So he couldn't get in trouble.

299
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:20,490
That's also been the norm in Japan.

300
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:24,393
Over in Japan, Yuji Naka staged a very similar rebellion

301
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:24,853
at Sega.

302
00:14:24,873 --> 00:14:27,415
So it was also policy at Sega that developers

303
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:29,217
couldn't use their real names.

304
00:14:29,857 --> 00:14:31,418
And on the loading screen for Sonic 1,

305
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,020
the developer names are actually there,

306
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,961
but they're in black text on a black background.

307
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:36,663
But if you put in a secret button code,

308
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:37,763
the names show up.

309
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:43,948
If the designers of the games seem

310
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:45,750
so desperate to put their names on them,

311
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,511
well, why weren't they allowed to?

312
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:53,006
I think this video, which is from 1982, it's like an ABC News segment, helps to shed a

313
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:53,546
little bit of light.

314
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:13,148
Taito let us videotape in a room called Deep Engineering.

315
00:15:13,528 --> 00:15:17,551
Without being overdramatic about the whole thing, this is the most secure room in the plant.

316
00:15:18,031 --> 00:15:21,594
This is where the game gets its life and personality from computer programmers.

317
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:25,416
Because of the fierce competition among video game companies,

318
00:15:25,817 --> 00:15:28,098
Taito requested we do not use last names.

319
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:33,041
But Rex is working with Mark on a new game called Toasters and Chainsaws.

320
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:36,030
Mark is computing what will appear on the screen.

321
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,971
Rex is using a computer to synthesize the sound you will

322
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:40,632
hear when the game hits the arcades.

323
00:15:41,953 --> 00:15:42,133
Right.

324
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:45,775
Because of the fierce competition between companies.

325
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:49,097
What that means is the company is worried that if the

326
00:15:49,117 --> 00:15:52,518
designer's names were known, then Rex or Mark might have

327
00:15:52,558 --> 00:15:54,179
gotten a better offer at another company.

328
00:15:54,239 --> 00:15:57,101
They might have broken out of deep engineering and been able

329
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:59,002
to get a different job.

330
00:15:59,242 --> 00:15:59,862
So weird.

331
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:00,743
It is weird.

332
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,925
Some designers have even staged more organized, effective

333
00:16:06,225 --> 00:16:07,306
rebellions against this.

334
00:16:07,406 --> 00:16:09,247
So it happened a while ago in board games.

335
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:14,311
In 1988 at the Nuremberg Toy Fair, a number of well-known

336
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:18,694
board game designers, they signed this beer coaster

337
00:16:18,734 --> 00:16:22,897
declaration by Reinhold Wittig, pledging that they

338
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:25,459
would never allow a publisher to print their game designs if

339
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:27,000
their names were not written on the box.

340
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,922
And that did become the norm in board games

341
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:30,402
starting in the 1990s.

342
00:16:34,147 --> 00:16:38,249
One of the best-known recent rebellions against the lack of credit was the case of Metal Gear Solid 5,

343
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:42,211
where Konami removed Kojima's name from the box art really late in the process.

344
00:16:43,531 --> 00:16:49,774
And Kojima responded dramatically by inserting prominent, detailed credits into every single mission of the game.

345
00:16:51,674 --> 00:16:58,460
So, all of this is just to say, although AAA games and tabletop games have this long history as well of downplaying the developer names,

346
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,703
that's not something the developers have wanted or accepted.

347
00:17:02,323 --> 00:17:06,487
They know credit is important and they've fought for it and they've kind of rebelled against those policies,

348
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:12,512
but they have commercial forces pushing them to remove their names and associate the games with the companies instead.

349
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:17,143
As indie developers, we don't have that kind of force

350
00:17:17,323 --> 00:17:17,904
pushing on us.

351
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:19,727
If we're erasing our names from the games,

352
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:21,510
we're doing that voluntarily.

353
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:23,653
We're doing something voluntarily

354
00:17:23,673 --> 00:17:25,976
that developers in other areas are actively trying

355
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:27,178
to resist and rebel against.

356
00:17:29,106 --> 00:17:31,207
In some industries, these rebellions have led to

357
00:17:31,247 --> 00:17:34,329
different defaults than we have in indie games, even in

358
00:17:34,409 --> 00:17:36,871
industries with comparable team sizes and

359
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:37,912
structures to our own.

360
00:17:38,032 --> 00:17:40,033
So this is how indie films handle credit.

361
00:17:41,074 --> 00:17:42,835
We can look at, oops, whoa.

362
00:17:43,535 --> 00:17:43,976
There we go.

363
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,943
So this is how The Terminator, an extremely famous indie

364
00:17:54,983 --> 00:17:55,763
movie, handles it.

365
00:17:56,464 --> 00:17:57,004
There's a name.

366
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:01,013
Another name.

367
00:18:03,495 --> 00:18:04,516
There are a lot of names here.

368
00:18:06,357 --> 00:18:08,259
Actually, indie films might be doing it too well

369
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:10,161
because it would take us like five minutes

370
00:18:10,201 --> 00:18:11,402
to get through this opening sequence,

371
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:12,402
and it's only names.

372
00:18:14,184 --> 00:18:17,867
So, maybe there's somewhere less far from us,

373
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:19,989
less far than indie films that we could look at

374
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:21,310
for better crediting practices.

375
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:23,532
And it actually turns out we can just look

376
00:18:23,552 --> 00:18:25,974
at the non-professional side of indie games.

377
00:18:26,254 --> 00:18:28,116
In community mods, names are everywhere,

378
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:28,576
which...

379
00:18:29,117 --> 00:18:30,137
It's kind of weird, right?

380
00:18:30,197 --> 00:18:34,618
Because you'd think that in a world where loads of people,

381
00:18:34,698 --> 00:18:36,699
entire communities, are working on things,

382
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,699
that names would be the least important aspect.

383
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,420
There's so many people contributing to these projects.

384
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,160
But it actually doesn't work that way.

385
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,122
And I wonder if it's because map creators have always

386
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:48,642
typically been credited.

387
00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:49,362
I don't know why.

388
00:18:49,382 --> 00:18:50,843
It just is how it worked, actually.

389
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:56,224
The earliest name that I ever remember seeing in a video game is Cliff Bleszinski's name

390
00:18:56,804 --> 00:19:01,086
in Unreal Tournament, way back as the person who was making some of the maps.

391
00:19:01,526 --> 00:19:05,427
And it's a charming, easy-to-remember name, so it's stuck in my mind.

392
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:11,329
And as mods have turned into full games, this trend has really continued.

393
00:19:11,469 --> 00:19:15,550
When Valve decided to make Dota 2, they bragged to the news about hiring IceFrog.

394
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:17,771
They didn't call it IceFrog's Dota.

395
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:19,920
But that's changing.

396
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,925
So clearly, some developers, even developers at big

397
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:26,349
companies, are starting to put their names on their games.

398
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,893
And that doesn't still mean that it would be easy for us

399
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:32,237
to change in our little corner of indie games where the

400
00:19:32,277 --> 00:19:33,819
default is still to be a company.

401
00:19:34,627 --> 00:19:36,809
because breaking from norms is uncomfortable.

402
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,893
And to do that, especially with such personal work,

403
00:19:40,373 --> 00:19:41,534
it requires a lot of effort.

404
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,157
So Ben and I wanted to share with you guys why we did it,

405
00:19:44,478 --> 00:19:47,201
the thought that we put into it, and hopefully give you

406
00:19:47,261 --> 00:19:49,904
a fuller picture of it, even if ultimately you decide,

407
00:19:50,264 --> 00:19:51,646
I don't want to put my name on this thing.

408
00:19:52,527 --> 00:19:54,970
So why do I put my name on my games?

409
00:19:56,108 --> 00:19:58,030
I think there are really two questions here.

410
00:19:58,831 --> 00:19:59,811
Why did I do it?

411
00:20:00,212 --> 00:20:01,553
And why do I do it now?

412
00:20:01,813 --> 00:20:03,474
And I'll just start with the easy one.

413
00:20:03,874 --> 00:20:05,596
Why did I put my name on my games?

414
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:08,338
Initially, I just did it because I came from the arts.

415
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,759
And in the arts, you sign your work.

416
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:11,440
I am not a good painter.

417
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,061
This is the best painting I've ever made.

418
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:13,902
Warning.

419
00:20:15,163 --> 00:20:16,104
It's not a good painting.

420
00:20:16,524 --> 00:20:16,724
But.

421
00:20:17,505 --> 00:20:18,925
There it is in the lower right hand corner.

422
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:19,466
I signed it.

423
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:21,647
I was proud of it at the time in college.

424
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:23,468
And so there you go.

425
00:20:23,868 --> 00:20:26,029
That's me signing my work.

426
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,891
Also, when you sign up for the App Store,

427
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:32,152
if you don't have a company, you just use your name.

428
00:20:32,593 --> 00:20:35,554
So I kind of benefited from this sort of double default

429
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:37,615
coming into making indie games.

430
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:39,476
And it turned out that in the game space,

431
00:20:39,856 --> 00:20:41,998
this default decision was actually

432
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:44,539
an accidentally radical business decision.

433
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:49,529
And I didn't really care for business decisions at the time that I made it.

434
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,592
I was the opinion that art and great games stand for themselves,

435
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:56,674
and promoting them is gross, and I wouldn't be a part of it,

436
00:20:56,994 --> 00:21:00,777
and that I wasn't going to be that asshole walking around talking about how good my stuff was.

437
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:03,779
So this one accidental business decision,

438
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:07,522
it ended up being my only business decision for a number of years,

439
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,384
and that gave it this weird sort of power.

440
00:21:11,365 --> 00:21:15,061
And it slowly, quietly became the entire core

441
00:21:15,081 --> 00:21:16,225
of my business philosophy.

442
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:19,097
Putting my name on my work forced me out

443
00:21:19,157 --> 00:21:21,598
into the public realm in a way that I didn't understand

444
00:21:21,658 --> 00:21:23,278
at the time that I made that decision,

445
00:21:23,478 --> 00:21:25,019
or didn't make that decision, I guess.

446
00:21:26,259 --> 00:21:27,440
But as I released more games,

447
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,061
my name started to come up in press pieces,

448
00:21:30,281 --> 00:21:32,682
and in comments, and in forums,

449
00:21:32,822 --> 00:21:35,143
and the press started to want to talk to me on podcasts

450
00:21:35,223 --> 00:21:36,684
and interview me in their articles.

451
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:38,524
Interviewers started to ask me

452
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:39,905
deeper questions about my work.

453
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,046
They started to find lines of continuity between my works,

454
00:21:43,146 --> 00:21:45,627
and the conversations started to become really fun for me.

455
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:50,529
I ended up learning a lot about myself and about my practice through these interviews

456
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:51,449
and these podcasts.

457
00:21:51,709 --> 00:21:56,271
And I started becoming comfortable sharing the things that were exciting to me.

458
00:21:56,831 --> 00:21:58,692
Why I liked making what I was making.

459
00:21:58,732 --> 00:22:00,112
What was exciting about it.

460
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:05,654
And it made me realize that promotion didn't have to be soulless or hype-centric.

461
00:22:06,335 --> 00:22:08,318
it could just be about transparency and honesty,

462
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,663
about opening up to the world and sharing

463
00:22:11,683 --> 00:22:14,007
why I was doing the things that I was doing,

464
00:22:14,468 --> 00:22:15,309
what mattered to me.

465
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:16,972
It was really just a different way

466
00:22:17,092 --> 00:22:18,494
of telling the kinds of stories

467
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:20,598
that I was already trying to tell through my games.

468
00:22:21,797 --> 00:22:23,899
This decision to put my names on my games

469
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:27,122
locked me into a certain level of thought and consideration

470
00:22:27,962 --> 00:22:29,804
about every single choice that I was making.

471
00:22:29,924 --> 00:22:31,806
And it meant that any time I did something

472
00:22:31,826 --> 00:22:33,648
that was challenging to common perceptions,

473
00:22:33,988 --> 00:22:35,850
I had to think about why I was doing that,

474
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,133
what was important about it, and how I was excited about it.

475
00:22:39,814 --> 00:22:41,836
And this process of doing those things

476
00:22:41,936 --> 00:22:44,298
really ended up being a major driver in most

477
00:22:44,338 --> 00:22:45,399
of my most successful work.

478
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,621
A few years ago, I made a game called Really Bad Chess.

479
00:22:48,821 --> 00:22:51,483
It's a chess game where you get random starting pieces,

480
00:22:51,923 --> 00:22:53,784
and everything is a mess, but it turns out

481
00:22:53,864 --> 00:22:54,925
that it's kind of fun.

482
00:22:55,685 --> 00:22:58,066
But it's not about a mess turning out to be fun.

483
00:22:58,446 --> 00:23:01,328
It's about my feelings that fairness is overrated,

484
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:03,169
that people think they like fairness,

485
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:05,450
but really, actually, we love unfairness.

486
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:08,452
Chess is a boring game to me because it's

487
00:23:08,572 --> 00:23:11,874
so ridiculous and grossly obsessed with being fair,

488
00:23:12,094 --> 00:23:15,216
and I wanted to turn that on its head and see what that did.

489
00:23:16,176 --> 00:23:19,118
And this idea that the press for Really Bad Chess

490
00:23:19,158 --> 00:23:20,579
wasn't going to be about the game itself,

491
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,502
but about my connection to the game, why I made it,

492
00:23:23,522 --> 00:23:25,743
the meaningfulness of my relationship

493
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:28,205
to fairness and the world, that came out

494
00:23:28,245 --> 00:23:29,787
of the line of thinking that started

495
00:23:29,827 --> 00:23:32,409
with putting my name on my work, standing behind it.

496
00:23:33,109 --> 00:23:34,991
It forced me to come to terms with the idea

497
00:23:35,031 --> 00:23:36,492
that the public reception of my work

498
00:23:36,812 --> 00:23:38,793
was actually stronger if I was in it,

499
00:23:39,114 --> 00:23:41,636
if the work was about my connection to the world,

500
00:23:41,696 --> 00:23:44,378
the birth of the idea, and not just the contents of the game

501
00:23:44,438 --> 00:23:44,698
itself.

502
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,761
And this has been really successful for me.

503
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,843
Really bad chess got covered in loads of places,

504
00:23:49,903 --> 00:23:50,985
including Slate.

505
00:23:51,405 --> 00:23:54,088
And that Slate piece ended up getting me an interview on NPR,

506
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:56,851
which is really kind of a ridiculous thing

507
00:23:56,911 --> 00:23:59,193
to happen for a very small mobile phone game.

508
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:02,601
So now I put my name in front of all my games,

509
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:04,963
because I want to lean into this humanity,

510
00:24:05,623 --> 00:24:06,905
to my connection to these games.

511
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:09,387
And I use this idea as a guide for all

512
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:10,808
of my other business decisions.

513
00:24:11,468 --> 00:24:13,510
So as I said, I'm coming to this as an artist.

514
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:14,791
I'm not a business person.

515
00:24:15,272 --> 00:24:17,294
So having a moral and ethical framework

516
00:24:17,354 --> 00:24:19,656
to use on the business side is something

517
00:24:19,696 --> 00:24:21,197
that has really helped me out in terms

518
00:24:21,237 --> 00:24:23,199
of making me feel comfortable putting

519
00:24:23,239 --> 00:24:26,742
the effort and the work into the things that aren't the games.

520
00:24:27,282 --> 00:24:28,122
the stuff around them.

521
00:24:28,242 --> 00:24:29,223
So here's an example.

522
00:24:29,263 --> 00:24:31,543
A few years ago, two things started

523
00:24:31,563 --> 00:24:34,544
to come up every single time I talked to strangers

524
00:24:34,624 --> 00:24:35,805
and they asked me what I did.

525
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,586
The first one was when I encountered people

526
00:24:39,986 --> 00:24:42,787
who had played my games, many of them

527
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:44,507
could identify one game I'd made,

528
00:24:44,827 --> 00:24:47,928
but they didn't know about others that I'd made,

529
00:24:48,048 --> 00:24:49,368
even if they'd played them and liked them.

530
00:24:49,528 --> 00:24:51,969
So many times people would come up to me and be like, oh my god,

531
00:24:51,989 --> 00:24:53,230
you also made whatever.

532
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:57,017
The other thing that happened is when I encountered people

533
00:24:57,157 --> 00:24:59,918
who didn't know about my work or who didn't play video games,

534
00:25:00,238 --> 00:25:03,359
the conversation often become kind of excruciating

535
00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:04,700
as I tried to explain what I did.

536
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,981
Video games are stuck with this very low culture label,

537
00:25:08,341 --> 00:25:09,542
which sucks, right?

538
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,322
I don't feel that way about video games.

539
00:25:11,342 --> 00:25:12,783
You probably don't feel that way about them.

540
00:25:13,483 --> 00:25:15,564
And I started to become convinced that this problem

541
00:25:15,704 --> 00:25:19,506
is because most people out there see games as disposable toys,

542
00:25:19,806 --> 00:25:20,966
not as artistic works.

543
00:25:21,507 --> 00:25:24,571
And I think that happens because we hide the people who make them.

544
00:25:24,812 --> 00:25:28,837
This is something that Bennett is going to actually get more into pretty heavily in a moment,

545
00:25:28,878 --> 00:25:30,420
so I don't want to go too much into it.

546
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:35,627
But I did just want to say that I think it really changes the way that people understand

547
00:25:35,687 --> 00:25:37,851
and relate to art when they can see the people in it.

548
00:25:38,734 --> 00:25:41,276
Anyway, I realized actually both of these problems

549
00:25:41,436 --> 00:25:42,837
are essentially outreach problems.

550
00:25:43,357 --> 00:25:47,000
So I had this little widget built for my games,

551
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,222
initially by John Brodsky and then later rebuilt

552
00:25:49,242 --> 00:25:50,162
by Denver Colson.

553
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:52,944
And the idea with this widget is that it sits

554
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:54,746
on the main screen of my games and it serves

555
00:25:54,806 --> 00:25:56,047
a bunch of different purposes.

556
00:25:56,107 --> 00:25:57,648
This is what it looks like.

557
00:25:59,749 --> 00:26:00,410
Cool.

558
00:26:01,831 --> 00:26:02,211
Games.

559
00:26:04,975 --> 00:26:07,835
So on the business end, it cross-promotes my other games.

560
00:26:08,455 --> 00:26:10,396
It allows me to send messages to everybody

561
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:12,416
who's playing my games when I release something new

562
00:26:12,476 --> 00:26:13,316
that they might care about.

563
00:26:14,617 --> 00:26:16,737
And it allows people to sign up for my mailing list.

564
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:19,858
And it makes it clear to everybody what I've worked on.

565
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:21,358
Nobody's telling me, oh my god, I

566
00:26:21,378 --> 00:26:22,458
can't believe you worked on that, too.

567
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:24,579
Nothing particularly groundbreaking, though,

568
00:26:24,939 --> 00:26:27,839
although still not something a lot of indies are doing,

569
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:28,980
but nothing amazing.

570
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:33,743
But on the values end, it shows who I am, a real human being,

571
00:26:33,783 --> 00:26:37,244
right at the top, a big, embarrassing, dumb photo of me.

572
00:26:37,264 --> 00:26:38,064
Hi.

573
00:26:38,084 --> 00:26:38,785
I hate that.

574
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:40,665
It was really hard to pick that photo out.

575
00:26:40,845 --> 00:26:42,606
But it really matters that it's there.

576
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:45,887
It also lets me tell you what my games are

577
00:26:45,927 --> 00:26:48,969
about in my own words, not in the words of journalists

578
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:50,089
or app stores.

579
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:53,010
And it also lets me send you messages

580
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,731
about things that I think matter beyond the scope of games,

581
00:26:56,092 --> 00:26:57,432
like when there's an election.

582
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:00,949
I would never have been comfortable spending time

583
00:27:01,029 --> 00:27:03,470
on something so businessy if I couldn't have married it

584
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,670
with the values that I have.

585
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,591
And the truth is, I think this is what people actually want.

586
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:09,451
I think they want the values.

587
00:27:09,491 --> 00:27:12,212
That's why they come to artistic mediums in the first place.

588
00:27:12,532 --> 00:27:15,293
And the business that I built is just this mechanism

589
00:27:15,393 --> 00:27:17,133
that I can use to share these values.

590
00:27:18,593 --> 00:27:21,054
But if you don't care about values, here are some numbers.

591
00:27:22,404 --> 00:27:24,706
After I put this in my games, I had an additional 8,000

592
00:27:25,287 --> 00:27:26,369
downloads in four days.

593
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:30,233
And 65% of those people bought the games, which is absolutely

594
00:27:30,293 --> 00:27:32,516
stupid, because my games are free to play, and you don't

595
00:27:32,556 --> 00:27:33,097
have to buy them.

596
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:37,142
I also tripled the size of my mailing list, which is

597
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:38,404
completely ridiculous.

598
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:48,005
But most important to me, these numbers are not just business success numbers, they represent

599
00:27:48,045 --> 00:27:52,390
people that I've connected to, who my work is connected to, people who are learning and

600
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,994
exploring and enjoying the space of games and the humanity within that space.

601
00:27:56,395 --> 00:27:58,237
I don't often know how people come to my games.

602
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:01,300
I don't do analytics and not a lot of,

603
00:28:02,221 --> 00:28:03,783
even if I did, there's not too much

604
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:04,624
that I could really learn.

605
00:28:04,924 --> 00:28:07,447
But in the case of these 8,000 people,

606
00:28:07,908 --> 00:28:09,029
I know that they went through the door

607
00:28:09,069 --> 00:28:10,671
that I set up with my values

608
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:12,092
and the story that I think matters.

609
00:28:12,313 --> 00:28:14,375
And as an artist, that's the thing that I really care about.

610
00:28:14,495 --> 00:28:15,917
And it totally trips me out

611
00:28:15,977 --> 00:28:18,560
that this can basically be accomplished with cross-promotion.

612
00:28:21,147 --> 00:28:24,589
All right, as you saw in the What's Friends loading screen,

613
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,231
I didn't start out with this point of view.

614
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,653
I had the default point of view everybody else has.

615
00:28:29,673 --> 00:28:32,636
So this is something that I've arrived at relatively recently.

616
00:28:32,876 --> 00:28:34,717
And I wanted to take a few minutes just

617
00:28:34,737 --> 00:28:37,239
to tell you about how I wound up there

618
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,021
and how I think about it now.

619
00:28:40,846 --> 00:28:44,672
Back in 2013, I made a real-time chess game for 16 people,

620
00:28:45,072 --> 00:28:47,496
and I called it Bennett Foddy's Speed Chess.

621
00:28:47,896 --> 00:28:50,140
And at the time, to be honest, that

622
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,683
was just a flippant joke about Sid Meier.

623
00:28:53,344 --> 00:28:54,826
I really hadn't thought about it at all.

624
00:28:54,846 --> 00:28:55,507
It was just a joke.

625
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,142
But the idea started to nag at me.

626
00:28:59,182 --> 00:29:01,463
It seemed a little bit more interesting.

627
00:29:02,123 --> 00:29:03,704
And if I think back, actually there

628
00:29:03,724 --> 00:29:07,725
was a long string of games that I played growing up that

629
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:10,346
experimented with prominent author placement.

630
00:29:10,626 --> 00:29:13,547
And it always seemed exciting and radical to me

631
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:14,468
when I would encounter them.

632
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,191
Richard Garriott's nom de plume, Lord British,

633
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:21,932
appears both as the author and as the authority character,

634
00:29:21,972 --> 00:29:23,673
the king, in the Ultima series of games,

635
00:29:23,693 --> 00:29:25,293
starting in Ultima 1 and Ultima 2.

636
00:29:25,593 --> 00:29:26,773
I love that series of games.

637
00:29:27,374 --> 00:29:30,875
And in 1999, I was finally able to download,

638
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:32,835
after years of waiting, I was able to download

639
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:34,836
the demo of this game.

640
00:29:34,876 --> 00:29:36,696
I was so hyped for Ultima 9.

641
00:29:37,737 --> 00:29:41,398
And not many people have seen this, I guess, in this room,

642
00:29:41,438 --> 00:29:43,478
but when you boot up that demo for the game,

643
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:45,219
Richard Garriott appears.

644
00:29:46,037 --> 00:29:49,720
sort of half in character as Lord British and half as Richard Garriott.

645
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,122
I'm going to just show you the beginning of that.

646
00:29:53,163 --> 00:29:56,486
Greetings. I am Richard Garriott, known to some of you as Lord British.

647
00:29:57,047 --> 00:29:59,909
And today I've brought you deep into the dungeons below Britannia Manor

648
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:04,193
to introduce to you at long last the demo to Ultima 9 Ascension.

649
00:30:05,977 --> 00:30:08,838
He goes on in that video to explain their creative goals

650
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:11,500
in making the game, what they're hoping for your experience.

651
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,421
And the video and the situation is kind of awkward

652
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:18,703
through 2019 eyes, but it was so unexpected,

653
00:30:18,723 --> 00:30:21,304
it sort of stuck in my mind for 20 years

654
00:30:21,364 --> 00:30:22,604
as a memorable experience.

655
00:30:23,485 --> 00:30:27,366
And around 1999, go a couple years forward into the future,

656
00:30:27,386 --> 00:30:30,228
it was about that time that art games started to emerge.

657
00:30:31,166 --> 00:30:33,189
And just like today, the people who make art games

658
00:30:33,689 --> 00:30:36,172
feature themselves and their names more prominently in their games.

659
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:37,814
Presumably because that's just normal.

660
00:30:37,854 --> 00:30:40,798
If you think about yourself as making art rather than games.

661
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:45,904
In 2001, Tale of Tales put 3D scans of their own naked bodies

662
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:50,189
into a virtual Garden of Eden in this Quake 3 mod, Eden.garden.

663
00:30:52,355 --> 00:30:54,557
And a couple years after that, Mary Flanagan's Unreal

664
00:30:54,658 --> 00:30:59,143
Tournament Mod, Domestic, 2003, I

665
00:30:59,183 --> 00:31:00,985
think is one of the first games that's

666
00:31:01,205 --> 00:31:03,768
overtly about the designer's autobiographical experience.

667
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,271
And it features her name prominently as well.

668
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:08,814
I think that's the first autobiographical game

669
00:31:08,854 --> 00:31:09,595
from some point of view.

670
00:31:11,992 --> 00:31:14,054
When you get to the end of Sexy Hiking, which was first

671
00:31:14,094 --> 00:31:16,176
released around the same time, 2002,

672
00:31:16,816 --> 00:31:18,237
the reward for beating the game is

673
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:20,899
you get to virtually meet the designer, Jasuo.

674
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,542
He wrote a thank you poem to himself,

675
00:31:24,723 --> 00:31:26,044
comparing himself to Jesus.

676
00:31:26,944 --> 00:31:29,366
And there's a song, and it features his smiling face.

677
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:35,291
So fast forward a decade to 2015.

678
00:31:35,391 --> 00:31:37,813
Two games came out that year that had a huge impact on me.

679
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:43,735
In Nina Freeman Sybil, you're literally asked to play as Nina.

680
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:45,035
Want to do a run together?

681
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:47,697
Taking her perspective in a way that I had never really

682
00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:49,637
been asked to do by a game before.

683
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:51,598
Huge impact on me.

684
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:56,220
And in the Beginner's Guide, Davey Reardon

685
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,621
is in your ear the whole time while you're playing speaking.

686
00:31:59,221 --> 00:32:00,502
And the trailer for that game is actually

687
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:02,663
super helpful for understanding what I'm talking about here.

688
00:32:02,703 --> 00:32:04,023
So I'm just going to play the first part of it.

689
00:32:07,872 --> 00:32:12,016
Let's say you sit down at a stranger's computer. You start opening up files and

690
00:32:12,036 --> 00:32:12,817
looking through stuff,

691
00:32:13,317 --> 00:32:16,480
and eventually you come to a folder that just says, My Work.

692
00:32:17,021 --> 00:32:20,464
So you open it, and you click on a random file, and it's a video game

693
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:24,489
that looks like this. If you had to guess,

694
00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:27,812
what would you say you know about this person right now? Like,

695
00:32:28,032 --> 00:32:29,113
maybe they're kinda goofy.

696
00:32:33,207 --> 00:32:35,989
All those games were really meaningful to me as a player.

697
00:32:36,109 --> 00:32:38,210
I think much more meaningful for the fact

698
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,012
that I understood the games to be

699
00:32:40,032 --> 00:32:41,973
the work of actual human beings.

700
00:32:42,773 --> 00:32:44,054
It felt like when I was playing the games,

701
00:32:44,074 --> 00:32:46,135
I was somehow in dialogue with the designers,

702
00:32:46,235 --> 00:32:49,057
responding to ideas or arguments that they were putting forward

703
00:32:49,077 --> 00:32:49,778
in their designs.

704
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:54,461
And when I appreciate artwork in any other medium,

705
00:32:55,001 --> 00:32:57,783
including games actually, whether it's music, film,

706
00:32:57,983 --> 00:33:00,484
fine arts, literature, I feel like one of the deepest.

707
00:33:01,243 --> 00:33:02,984
most important and beautiful parts of it

708
00:33:03,084 --> 00:33:04,724
is the sense that I'm getting an understanding

709
00:33:04,864 --> 00:33:07,325
of the person or the people behind those things

710
00:33:07,406 --> 00:33:09,186
and seeing their perspectives.

711
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:12,588
If you look at Frida Kahlo's self-portraits,

712
00:33:12,608 --> 00:33:15,849
it's impossible not to connect to the sense of defiance

713
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:19,591
against social norms, social roles and artistic norms.

714
00:33:20,571 --> 00:33:23,012
Or if you play one of Jeff Minter's games, right,

715
00:33:23,132 --> 00:33:25,193
it's so clear how they connect to his childhood

716
00:33:25,213 --> 00:33:26,734
playing Golden Age arcade games

717
00:33:27,234 --> 00:33:28,555
and his interest in psychedelics.

718
00:33:29,952 --> 00:33:33,415
Those connections help me to understand each piece of work

719
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:35,937
and how it relates to the artist's other work.

720
00:33:36,738 --> 00:33:39,541
For me, that's the good stuff in indie games.

721
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:40,762
That's what I'm here for.

722
00:33:40,802 --> 00:33:41,803
That's why I play them.

723
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:48,028
One of the reasons it seems so radical

724
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:50,090
to put a personal side in the game, I think,

725
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:52,853
is that this idea of games being

726
00:33:53,923 --> 00:33:58,485
the products of human beings, they're made by human beings,

727
00:33:58,845 --> 00:34:01,505
that idea runs contrary to the overwhelming trend

728
00:34:01,545 --> 00:34:02,125
in the culture.

729
00:34:02,586 --> 00:34:04,386
So I feel like there's this ongoing crisis

730
00:34:05,006 --> 00:34:07,007
of depersonalization in games, where

731
00:34:07,027 --> 00:34:09,907
the people who play our games are disconnected from the idea

732
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:10,868
that we are human beings.

733
00:34:11,268 --> 00:34:13,188
Though on the extreme end, there's

734
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:16,609
review bombings, and these kind of pro-consumerist campaigns.

735
00:34:17,671 --> 00:34:20,995
But even just the tone of regular, everyday technical

736
00:34:21,015 --> 00:34:24,559
support can reveal a human disconnect between the people

737
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,141
who make games and the people who play them.

738
00:34:26,722 --> 00:34:29,105
And I feel, honestly, like I shouldn't have to work hard to

739
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:29,786
convince you of this.

740
00:34:30,086 --> 00:34:32,689
Probably everybody in this room has had some kind of

741
00:34:32,769 --> 00:34:35,613
exchange with a player where they were treated like a giant

742
00:34:35,653 --> 00:34:37,154
corporation rather than as a person.

743
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,280
Conversely, I've noticed that when

744
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,941
we put a human face on our games,

745
00:34:43,362 --> 00:34:45,984
sometimes that adversarial relationship just kind of melts

746
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:48,025
away, because most people are basically

747
00:34:48,125 --> 00:34:49,806
decent and empathetic when they realize

748
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:52,028
that they're talking to a person instead of a corporation.

749
00:34:52,988 --> 00:34:56,831
In this exchange, a person goes from being aggressive out

750
00:34:56,871 --> 00:34:59,273
of nowhere to sweet, just with one personal note

751
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:00,033
from the designer.

752
00:35:00,053 --> 00:35:03,095
And it's Chris Hecker, so sweet guy.

753
00:35:06,136 --> 00:35:08,217
But if it was just a question of avoiding getting yelled at

754
00:35:08,437 --> 00:35:10,377
in your Steam forums, that would be fine.

755
00:35:10,397 --> 00:35:12,638
That would be easy, because you could just respond personally

756
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:14,678
to every person who was mad at you,

757
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,019
and you could get them to simmer down.

758
00:35:16,539 --> 00:35:18,999
But to me, these exchanges are a sign

759
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,420
that something that should be happening

760
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,721
when people play our games is sort of failing to happen.

761
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:28,862
I want to be treated by my audience as a human being.

762
00:35:29,702 --> 00:35:30,843
That's something I want for me.

763
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:35,945
But I also want for them to be able to see me as a human being.

764
00:35:35,985 --> 00:35:40,327
Because if they aren't doing that, they're missing out on half of what makes my games beautiful,

765
00:35:41,107 --> 00:35:42,108
what makes them enjoyable.

766
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:48,330
So it was with all of that in mind that I started to push the game that I was working on at the time,

767
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:52,191
getting over it, in the direction of overt self-humanization.

768
00:35:53,248 --> 00:35:54,729
I put my name on the title again,

769
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,192
this time with much more intent behind it,

770
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,574
trying to frame the game as a thing made by me,

771
00:35:59,594 --> 00:36:01,556
a particular person, for the player,

772
00:36:01,636 --> 00:36:03,017
who is also a particular person.

773
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,102
And I'm gonna play some clips from the game,

774
00:36:08,162 --> 00:36:10,505
it's got my voice in it, it's very embarrassing for me,

775
00:36:10,545 --> 00:36:13,768
I really like, I hope you feel a little sorry for me,

776
00:36:13,788 --> 00:36:14,709
this is gonna be torture.

777
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,812
So I had the idea, I was really inspired by Davey's game,

778
00:36:20,473 --> 00:36:22,114
that I could help the player to understand

779
00:36:22,154 --> 00:36:24,336
where I was coming from if I just straight up

780
00:36:24,376 --> 00:36:26,217
explained where I was coming from while they

781
00:36:26,257 --> 00:36:26,818
were playing the game.

782
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:30,581
A funny thing happened to me as I was building this game.

783
00:36:31,521 --> 00:36:33,163
I'd have an idea for a new obstacle,

784
00:36:33,383 --> 00:36:36,145
and I'd build it, test it, and it would usually

785
00:36:36,185 --> 00:36:37,746
turn out to be unreasonably hard.

786
00:36:39,148 --> 00:36:40,868
but I couldn't bring myself to make it easier.

787
00:36:40,888 --> 00:36:42,929
It already felt like my inability

788
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:45,289
to get past the new obstacle was my fault,

789
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:47,450
as a player rather than as a builder.

790
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,091
Imaginary mountains build themselves

791
00:36:50,131 --> 00:36:51,491
from our efforts to climb,

792
00:36:51,951 --> 00:36:54,112
and it's our repeated attempts to reach the summit

793
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,252
that turns those mountains into something real.

794
00:36:58,993 --> 00:37:00,373
As you go further along in that game,

795
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:05,336
I stop explaining my ideas and I start trying to reflect the fact that the player has been

796
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:10,160
sitting and listening to me yammer on and playing my game for several hours, drawing

797
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,844
attention to the fact that we must at least have certain tastes in common if they've played

798
00:37:14,864 --> 00:37:15,665
that far in the game.

799
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:23,311
It feels like we're closer now, composer and climber, designer and user.

800
00:37:24,172 --> 00:37:25,613
You could have refused, but you didn't.

801
00:37:26,254 --> 00:37:29,356
There was something in you that was hidden, that chose to continue.

802
00:37:33,036 --> 00:37:35,358
Finally, by the very end of the game,

803
00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm sincerely thanking the player for putting in the effort.

804
00:37:42,863 --> 00:37:44,904
Now, you've conquered the ice cliff,

805
00:37:45,445 --> 00:37:48,187
the platforms, the church, and the rectory,

806
00:37:48,907 --> 00:37:50,608
the living room and the factory,

807
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:53,210
the playground, the construction site,

808
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,592
the granite rocks, and the lakeside.

809
00:37:57,173 --> 00:37:57,973
You've learned to hike.

810
00:37:59,496 --> 00:38:02,377
There's no way left to go but up, and in a moment I'll shut up.

811
00:38:03,077 --> 00:38:05,558
But let me say, I'm glad you came.

812
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,360
When I... Thanks.

813
00:38:16,903 --> 00:38:18,544
When I was writing and recording those lines,

814
00:38:18,684 --> 00:38:21,945
I actually found that the way I was thinking about my players was changing too.

815
00:38:22,975 --> 00:38:26,137
If I'm honest, I came into the process of making this game

816
00:38:26,657 --> 00:38:29,839
harboring certain resentments about the players who

817
00:38:29,859 --> 00:38:34,461
tweet my games as like disposable fun machines or rage engines

818
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:36,422
or who just watch them being played on YouTube

819
00:38:36,442 --> 00:38:37,382
and then kind of click away.

820
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:39,263
I was kind of resentful of those people.

821
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:42,039
But in the process of recording those lines,

822
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:43,639
I started to feel closer to them.

823
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,880
And I started to feel more appreciative

824
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,101
of the contribution that they would make to the game

825
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:50,701
by playing it, partly because I was having to play it myself.

826
00:38:50,721 --> 00:38:51,882
It's a pretty annoying game.

827
00:38:52,322 --> 00:38:55,503
But I was feeling closer to the players.

828
00:38:57,163 --> 00:38:59,164
Inspired by Jazua's game, I wanted

829
00:38:59,184 --> 00:39:01,725
to go further and put a reward at the end of the game

830
00:39:02,745 --> 00:39:03,485
for people who finished it.

831
00:39:04,589 --> 00:39:05,949
But I wanted to make it a real way

832
00:39:05,989 --> 00:39:07,590
to connect with the real individuals who

833
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,270
finished the game.

834
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:11,011
I figured it would be a special moment

835
00:39:11,111 --> 00:39:12,631
for a small handful of people.

836
00:39:13,211 --> 00:39:14,612
And I kept it secret for a while,

837
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:16,572
but I'm going to spoil it for you now if you haven't seen it.

838
00:39:16,592 --> 00:39:18,313
So plug your ears if you haven't played it yet.

839
00:39:19,573 --> 00:39:21,194
The first thing that happened is a friend suggested

840
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:26,115
I could show a live feed of my computer's webcam to my desk.

841
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,575
And I could wave at players who finished the game

842
00:39:28,595 --> 00:39:31,316
and be like, hello, like Richard Garriott in the Ultimate demo.

843
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,091
but is a little too invasive,

844
00:39:35,511 --> 00:39:37,152
partly because I work on a laptop.

845
00:39:38,172 --> 00:39:39,633
So I had this idea instead that

846
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:42,174
what if when you finish the game

847
00:39:42,194 --> 00:39:43,515
you get to visit a chat room?

848
00:39:44,936 --> 00:39:46,216
And maybe I'll be there.

849
00:39:47,097 --> 00:39:48,758
And so I built one and I set it up

850
00:39:48,798 --> 00:39:50,659
so my phone would get a notification

851
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:52,079
if somebody finished the game

852
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:53,760
and I could run over to my computer

853
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,761
and jump into the chat room

854
00:39:54,781 --> 00:39:56,562
and talk to them right as they finished the game.

855
00:39:56,702 --> 00:39:58,202
I want to share some of that with you.

856
00:40:00,764 --> 00:40:02,485
This was one of the first people to finish the game.

857
00:40:03,595 --> 00:40:06,097
And the first thing he does is he connects his experience

858
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,199
of playing it to earlier games of mine.

859
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:10,661
He says, I've been playing all your games since I was a kid.

860
00:40:11,121 --> 00:40:12,403
Connecting it to my other work.

861
00:40:13,323 --> 00:40:14,244
It was huge for me.

862
00:40:18,448 --> 00:40:20,109
Some of my QWOP antics got me into trouble

863
00:40:20,149 --> 00:40:22,251
in computer science, I hear about that a lot.

864
00:40:25,054 --> 00:40:26,655
A lot of people who reached the end of the game

865
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:28,537
just couldn't believe that they were talking to me.

866
00:40:28,557 --> 00:40:30,038
This was really common.

867
00:40:35,134 --> 00:40:37,696
They're here, I share a yee with Zoe.

868
00:40:37,776 --> 00:40:39,718
You really can't believe I'm there.

869
00:40:39,858 --> 00:40:41,139
Some people just refuse to believe,

870
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:42,259
and like logged out, it's like,

871
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,881
not talking to a robot.

872
00:40:47,103 --> 00:40:49,665
Some people just wanted to say thanks for the game.

873
00:40:50,346 --> 00:40:52,567
And I wanted to take time to thank them

874
00:40:52,948 --> 00:40:53,888
for playing through it as well.

875
00:40:53,908 --> 00:40:54,849
It's usually what I said,

876
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,710
congratulations and thanks for playing.

877
00:40:57,391 --> 00:40:58,512
And they would say thank you for the game.

878
00:41:00,173 --> 00:41:01,414
I really love these moments.

879
00:41:01,434 --> 00:41:02,815
This was really meaningful to me, but.

880
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,860
The best ones, the ones that meant most to me,

881
00:41:07,321 --> 00:41:10,461
were these cases where I could share a feeling with the player.

882
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:13,122
A feeling that I had felt myself playing my own game,

883
00:41:13,142 --> 00:41:15,102
but I wanted them to feel when they were playing it.

884
00:41:15,943 --> 00:41:17,703
So in this case, this player says

885
00:41:18,723 --> 00:41:21,604
he started to feel like he felt more relief from falling back

886
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:23,825
down in the game than he did from making progress, which

887
00:41:23,845 --> 00:41:26,465
was exactly how I wanted him to feel.

888
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:28,786
And this player, by the way,

889
00:41:30,251 --> 00:41:31,972
was among the first to finish getting over it,

890
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:34,713
but still hangs out in a fan discord for the game

891
00:41:34,813 --> 00:41:35,453
every single day.

892
00:41:38,294 --> 00:41:39,694
On the mobile version, there's no chat room,

893
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:40,975
because it's not guaranteed online,

894
00:41:41,395 --> 00:41:44,756
but there's an invitation to send me an email.

895
00:41:53,063 --> 00:41:55,044
So that's similar to what Davey has, something similar

896
00:41:55,064 --> 00:41:55,684
in the beginner's guide.

897
00:41:56,005 --> 00:41:57,766
I really want to emphasize the humanity that

898
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:58,866
comes out in this exchange.

899
00:41:59,066 --> 00:42:01,148
This person, these are two emails

900
00:42:01,168 --> 00:42:03,049
from the same account that came within like five

901
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:03,889
minutes of each other.

902
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:08,532
The game is really intentionally frustrating and anger inducing.

903
00:42:08,552 --> 00:42:10,113
And the fact that this person understood

904
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,434
that I was a human being, even when they're just

905
00:42:12,554 --> 00:42:14,395
sending angry emails and getting no response,

906
00:42:14,756 --> 00:42:16,076
that was extremely satisfying.

907
00:42:19,493 --> 00:42:21,094
I feel like we've gotten a little off topic, Bennett.

908
00:42:21,114 --> 00:42:22,815
What does this have to do with putting your name on the game?

909
00:42:23,175 --> 00:42:23,816
Fair, all right.

910
00:42:23,856 --> 00:42:24,656
It's a fair question.

911
00:42:26,717 --> 00:42:30,679
For me, putting my name on my game sent me down a road of

912
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,001
thinking about how indie games are mostly depersonalized and

913
00:42:35,041 --> 00:42:37,283
reflecting on what I could do to change that in my own work,

914
00:42:37,383 --> 00:42:39,804
how I could signal to the player that I was a human being.

915
00:42:40,982 --> 00:42:42,983
And in the end, it changed the way

916
00:42:43,003 --> 00:42:45,566
that I was able to relate to the fans of Getting Over It,

917
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,988
and I hope, to the way that they were able to relate

918
00:42:49,008 --> 00:42:50,530
to me and to my work.

919
00:42:52,912 --> 00:42:54,313
And for me, it set me on the road

920
00:42:54,393 --> 00:42:57,015
to finding a way to relate to running my business

921
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:57,636
as an artist.

922
00:42:57,956 --> 00:42:59,377
It helped me not feel like an asshole

923
00:42:59,437 --> 00:43:00,999
when it came time to promote my games.

924
00:43:03,841 --> 00:43:05,803
Ultimately, putting your name in the title of the game

925
00:43:05,843 --> 00:43:06,343
doesn't matter.

926
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:08,605
That's just a symbol of something that's more important.

927
00:43:09,517 --> 00:43:11,580
Whether you're making a live chat server

928
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,543
or building a cross-promotional widget,

929
00:43:14,064 --> 00:43:16,748
writing cinema-style credits, or just having your name show up

930
00:43:16,788 --> 00:43:18,650
at the start of the game or at the start of the trailer,

931
00:43:19,512 --> 00:43:21,074
all those choices have the same effect,

932
00:43:21,454 --> 00:43:23,237
which is to draw you closer to your audience

933
00:43:23,698 --> 00:43:25,420
and to draw your audience closer to you.

934
00:43:27,144 --> 00:43:29,065
And if we push in this direction as a group,

935
00:43:29,705 --> 00:43:31,846
we have the potential of moving the whole industry

936
00:43:31,886 --> 00:43:35,487
towards a more culturally important and powerful place,

937
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:38,728
a place in the arts, alongside film and television

938
00:43:38,848 --> 00:43:39,928
and sculpture and music,

939
00:43:40,428 --> 00:43:43,889
a place where video games are not even video games.

940
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:45,630
They're just video games.

941
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:49,871
All right, this has been a talk by us.

942
00:43:52,512 --> 00:43:54,593
Bennett Foddy and Zach Gage.

943
00:44:10,507 --> 00:44:12,449
Okay, I guess we've got some time for questions.

944
00:44:22,057 --> 00:44:23,438
Kevin Harper, As to New York.

945
00:44:26,301 --> 00:44:29,183
I guess where I'm struggling a little bit

946
00:44:29,283 --> 00:44:32,046
on my indie side is there are times where I need to.

947
00:44:34,221 --> 00:44:40,745
sell out, so to speak, and I'm not necessarily proud of what I put out at times.

948
00:44:41,566 --> 00:44:45,328
How do you feel about putting your name on something that you're not all so happy about?

949
00:44:46,408 --> 00:44:47,309
It's such a good question.

950
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:53,893
I mean, yeah, I think we should be clear, we're not trying to say that everybody should do this in every case.

951
00:44:54,313 --> 00:44:56,875
There's going to be good reasons in many cases.

952
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:58,531
to not do it.

953
00:44:58,731 --> 00:45:00,052
And one reason might be that you're not

954
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,834
ready to stand behind it as part of the other parts

955
00:45:03,854 --> 00:45:04,855
of your artistic practice.

956
00:45:05,475 --> 00:45:09,838
Yeah, I think a bigger thing than just putting your name

957
00:45:09,898 --> 00:45:12,260
on the thing that you built is kind of like a step

958
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:14,862
to say that you're standing behind a thing

959
00:45:14,922 --> 00:45:18,524
and to get all of the privileges and gloriousness that

960
00:45:18,564 --> 00:45:20,005
comes with standing behind something

961
00:45:20,045 --> 00:45:22,547
and relating to people and having it be a human thing.

962
00:45:23,247 --> 00:45:25,830
And so if you're doing work that you're not super proud of

963
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:27,891
and you can't find a way to be super proud of it,

964
00:45:27,931 --> 00:45:28,772
that's OK, right?

965
00:45:29,113 --> 00:45:32,516
We all got to figure out how to survive and make a living

966
00:45:32,536 --> 00:45:34,898
and be alive and be able to do the work that we're doing.

967
00:45:35,959 --> 00:45:38,521
But when you do something that you are proud of,

968
00:45:38,561 --> 00:45:39,862
that you do want to stand behind,

969
00:45:40,002 --> 00:45:42,645
that's when we think it's really important that you feel

970
00:45:42,685 --> 00:45:43,926
comfortable putting your name on it

971
00:45:43,986 --> 00:45:46,868
and start to think about what that means and how to do that.

972
00:45:47,085 --> 00:45:52,927
I would just add, I have a game called Evacuation I made very early on in my game design career

973
00:45:53,547 --> 00:45:57,228
that I'm not super proud of, that I still put my name on anyway.

974
00:45:58,108 --> 00:46:02,749
And although I see problems in that game and I don't really feel like it sort of represents

975
00:46:02,809 --> 00:46:07,070
well my abilities as a designer, every time it goes down because there's something wrong

976
00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:08,770
with my server, somebody will send me an email.

977
00:46:09,791 --> 00:46:11,811
They'll be like, oh, I need that game to be there.

978
00:46:11,831 --> 00:46:12,311
I need it.

979
00:46:12,431 --> 00:46:13,391
It's so important to me.

980
00:46:13,411 --> 00:46:14,732
And I'm like, all right.

981
00:46:15,532 --> 00:46:15,692
So.

982
00:46:16,883 --> 00:46:20,344
Part of it is, it's not always for me to tell people

983
00:46:20,484 --> 00:46:22,225
which of my pieces of work are important

984
00:46:22,245 --> 00:46:23,985
or which connect as an artist.

985
00:46:24,025 --> 00:46:26,846
So I tilt the balance in favor of signing it.

986
00:46:26,866 --> 00:46:29,506
I would also, Jesus Christ, now I'm just ping-ponging.

987
00:46:29,546 --> 00:46:32,107
This is the danger of having two people on the stage.

988
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,968
I would also say that I have, on my website,

989
00:46:35,748 --> 00:46:37,568
I have everything I've ever put out

990
00:46:37,648 --> 00:46:39,329
since before I was in college, which

991
00:46:39,409 --> 00:46:40,869
is deeply embarrassing.

992
00:46:40,909 --> 00:46:43,350
Some of that stuff is just horrible photography.

993
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:45,130
But the reason that it's up there

994
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:46,510
is because I think that.

995
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:50,272
on the extremely rare chance that someone is gonna come

996
00:46:50,292 --> 00:46:52,313
to my website and be like, oh, I like this person,

997
00:46:52,353 --> 00:46:54,154
how did they get to where they are?

998
00:46:54,254 --> 00:46:55,215
What was their path?

999
00:46:55,295 --> 00:46:57,316
Like, I think it's important that they see all the stuff

1000
00:46:57,516 --> 00:47:00,177
that I thought was cool once upon a time

1001
00:47:00,237 --> 00:47:03,519
and now I'm embarrassed about because that was my path here

1002
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:05,200
and I wanna share that.

1003
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,261
That's the kind of relationship I wanna have

1004
00:47:07,301 --> 00:47:08,621
with the people who like my work.

1005
00:47:08,921 --> 00:47:09,181
It's real.

1006
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,492
Yeah, hey, thanks for the talk.

1007
00:47:12,852 --> 00:47:16,316
My name's Yon, and I'm wondering what to do if you

1008
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:19,019
dislike your own name or if it is hard to pronounce or

1009
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,819
remember for people.

1010
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,661
So I adopted the pseudonym Yon.

1011
00:47:21,681 --> 00:47:24,645
My name's Yonatan or Jonathan, because I always thought it

1012
00:47:24,665 --> 00:47:26,587
was too long and didn't mean anything.

1013
00:47:26,627 --> 00:47:28,709
And then I found out after going by Yon for a couple

1014
00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:30,671
years, it's the most common name in Korea.

1015
00:47:30,731 --> 00:47:32,012
So it's pretty much un-Google-able.

1016
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:36,676
And also, like, it doesn't, I don't, like, my last name

1017
00:47:37,037 --> 00:47:38,718
combined with a pseudonym doesn't make any sense.

1018
00:47:38,758 --> 00:47:40,639
I have this, like, weird, like, every other pseudonym

1019
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,342
I ever worked under, I get tired of after about a year.

1020
00:47:43,362 --> 00:47:44,583
Do you have any thoughts on that?

1021
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:47,605
Yeah, so my name is stupid, but easy to pronounce.

1022
00:47:47,925 --> 00:47:50,788
But it doesn't save me from that kind of problem.

1023
00:47:50,808 --> 00:47:52,669
You know, foddy is actually a very rude word

1024
00:47:52,709 --> 00:47:54,070
in Brazilian Portuguese, so...

1025
00:47:57,712 --> 00:47:58,492
Yeah, I don't know.

1026
00:47:58,512 --> 00:47:59,632
I mean, I think in that situation,

1027
00:47:59,652 --> 00:48:01,833
if I was feeling that way, I would just pick a pseudonym

1028
00:48:01,873 --> 00:48:03,634
and I would just stick to it for my whole career.

1029
00:48:03,654 --> 00:48:07,595
What we're talking about is connecting the game

1030
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:08,595
to an individual person.

1031
00:48:08,815 --> 00:48:10,436
Doesn't matter what kind of name it is.

1032
00:48:10,716 --> 00:48:12,216
Really, I really don't think it does matter.

1033
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,557
And Yeon is definitely easier to pronounce.

1034
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:17,838
Also, you're the only Yeon that I know, so that's cool.

1035
00:48:17,858 --> 00:48:18,719
I know a bunch of Yeon.

1036
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:19,879
Should hang out with some more Koreans.

1037
00:48:23,632 --> 00:48:25,074
Hi, my name's Duncan. I'm a journalist.

1038
00:48:26,895 --> 00:48:27,556
Question for Bennett.

1039
00:48:27,856 --> 00:48:28,777
Have you played Celeste?

1040
00:48:29,437 --> 00:48:29,597
Yep.

1041
00:48:30,698 --> 00:48:33,100
Okay, cool. First of all, what do you think of it?

1042
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,302
And second, how do you think you

1043
00:48:35,442 --> 00:48:37,383
and Matt Makes Games differ or are

1044
00:48:37,403 --> 00:48:38,744
similar in your creative styles?

1045
00:48:38,784 --> 00:48:41,347
Because getting over it is kind of similar.

1046
00:48:41,367 --> 00:48:43,568
Yeah, I'm a huge fan of Matt's

1047
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:44,849
work, especially level design.

1048
00:48:46,831 --> 00:48:47,551
I'm not actually

1049
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,573
good at video games, so I didn't get very far

1050
00:48:49,613 --> 00:48:50,134
in Celeste.

1051
00:48:50,942 --> 00:48:54,585
But I think that there is like some kind of similar ambition in that game.

1052
00:48:55,245 --> 00:48:59,369
It's a game by a group of people, but it is about humanization in some kind of way.

1053
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:00,770
So I do see a strong connection there.

1054
00:49:01,410 --> 00:49:05,054
I haven't played enough of it to give a really kind of deep view.

1055
00:49:06,074 --> 00:49:06,955
That's fine. Thank you.

1056
00:49:07,676 --> 00:49:07,856
Teddy.

1057
00:49:08,847 --> 00:49:10,087
Hi, I'm Teddy.

1058
00:49:11,088 --> 00:49:14,169
I swear to God this is a real question, but feel free to

1059
00:49:14,209 --> 00:49:16,450
disregard it and me.

1060
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,691
I'm using the mobile app for GDC, which I'm enjoying.

1061
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:23,712
And in the schedule it says, put your name on your game, a

1062
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,253
talk by Bennett, ellipses.

1063
00:49:29,518 --> 00:49:32,581
I'm wondering, process-wise, in the preparation of this talk,

1064
00:49:32,701 --> 00:49:33,982
if you discussed whose name was going

1065
00:49:34,002 --> 00:49:36,084
to appear first in the description or on this slide.

1066
00:49:36,104 --> 00:49:37,926
I don't know if you caught the slide about how

1067
00:49:37,946 --> 00:49:40,468
you don't have control over how other people will credit you.

1068
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:43,051
There you go.

1069
00:49:43,131 --> 00:49:46,914
Thank you.

1070
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,819
Hi, my question is about building a brand around

1071
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:50,220
yourself.

1072
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,682
And you talk about indie game devs as artists.

1073
00:49:53,923 --> 00:49:56,226
I know YouTubers and stuff, they always really build it

1074
00:49:56,246 --> 00:49:58,408
around their personality a lot of the times.

1075
00:49:59,929 --> 00:50:02,311
What is the process like doing that as a game dev?

1076
00:50:02,892 --> 00:50:06,876
And how is it different for you if there's thousands of

1077
00:50:06,936 --> 00:50:08,397
copies of your work out there?

1078
00:50:09,191 --> 00:50:10,091
Is it more personal?

1079
00:50:10,191 --> 00:50:14,572
I mean, we're not songwriters with big, giant cult

1080
00:50:14,612 --> 00:50:15,972
of the performer type things.

1081
00:50:16,693 --> 00:50:17,633
Have you ever seen that?

1082
00:50:17,653 --> 00:50:18,273
I don't know.

1083
00:50:20,473 --> 00:50:25,374
I think, I don't know the best way to answer this.

1084
00:50:25,434 --> 00:50:29,135
I guess for me, it was just a very natural process.

1085
00:50:29,175 --> 00:50:32,196
I think the reason I make things is

1086
00:50:32,236 --> 00:50:34,436
because I want to share stuff with the world.

1087
00:50:35,981 --> 00:50:39,626
I'm pretty shy, and I like putting out work

1088
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:42,669
so that when I talk to people, we can talk about it,

1089
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,291
when we can talk about what they put out,

1090
00:50:44,331 --> 00:50:47,235
and we've already shared this human level of connection

1091
00:50:47,295 --> 00:50:48,557
through the things that we made,

1092
00:50:48,617 --> 00:50:50,219
and then it's much easier

1093
00:50:50,259 --> 00:50:51,700
to have a conversation with somebody.

1094
00:50:53,362 --> 00:50:57,207
And so when I started to notice people on the internet

1095
00:50:57,267 --> 00:50:59,269
starting to try to have a conversation with me

1096
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:01,952
about my work, which happened just totally

1097
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:06,156
because my name was there, it was very easy to engage with,

1098
00:51:06,217 --> 00:51:08,179
and it was something that I was quite excited about,

1099
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:09,520
because that's why I'm making it.

1100
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,922
I want to have those conversations.

1101
00:51:11,262 --> 00:51:12,143
I want to get it out there.

1102
00:51:12,183 --> 00:51:12,543
And I think.

1103
00:51:14,265 --> 00:51:17,387
When I started, I mean, I don't know how eloquent I am now,

1104
00:51:17,447 --> 00:51:19,689
but I was definitely not very eloquent when I started

1105
00:51:19,769 --> 00:51:21,890
because like, why would I be?

1106
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:24,132
Like, who has the practice of figuring out

1107
00:51:24,172 --> 00:51:26,274
how to get their message out to a lot of strangers?

1108
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:28,255
But that's part of the process

1109
00:51:28,275 --> 00:51:29,516
of having these conversations,

1110
00:51:29,616 --> 00:51:31,357
is like, you start to hone in on like,

1111
00:51:31,457 --> 00:51:32,338
oh, what are the things?

1112
00:51:32,918 --> 00:51:36,462
that what are people seeing when they look at my work that gets them excited?

1113
00:51:36,822 --> 00:51:40,425
How can I start to be clearer about what I want them to see?

1114
00:51:40,485 --> 00:51:43,448
And how can I start to relate to the things that they're seeing?

1115
00:51:43,608 --> 00:51:45,210
I think in a lot of...

1116
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:49,013
Probably the biggest lesson I've learned in all of my time in game development

1117
00:51:49,113 --> 00:51:52,817
is a broader appreciation for the kinds of things that I personally don't like

1118
00:51:52,857 --> 00:51:53,818
that other people like.

1119
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:54,478
And a lot of my...

1120
00:51:55,399 --> 00:51:59,182
Best games probably have come out of genres that I didn't

1121
00:51:59,302 --> 00:52:01,983
like or didn't respect and had never spent time with and then

1122
00:52:02,023 --> 00:52:02,604
made something.

1123
00:52:02,624 --> 00:52:03,845
And then people sort of liked it.

1124
00:52:03,885 --> 00:52:06,666
And then I was like, oh, why do they like that?

1125
00:52:06,766 --> 00:52:08,107
How can I relate to this person?

1126
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,609
They're coming at it from such a totally different angle.

1127
00:52:11,249 --> 00:52:12,610
And I want to be there with them.

1128
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:14,932
I want to figure out how to rotate my view to see what

1129
00:52:14,952 --> 00:52:15,492
they're seeing.

1130
00:52:15,512 --> 00:52:18,214
Yeah, this is a thing that people will do to your work.

1131
00:52:19,575 --> 00:52:27,883
The experience that I had is the first games interview that I gave was for Wired magazine.

1132
00:52:28,283 --> 00:52:31,186
Fred Benenson wanted to interview me for Wired.

1133
00:52:31,206 --> 00:52:34,129
He had like a part-time gig writing for them.

1134
00:52:34,710 --> 00:52:38,413
And so he wanted to write about QWOP in Wired.

1135
00:52:38,453 --> 00:52:41,236
And I'd never given an interview about it before.

1136
00:52:41,316 --> 00:52:42,837
I was working as a philosopher at the time.

1137
00:52:43,398 --> 00:52:46,741
And Fred came in with these questions where he'd looked at all my work

1138
00:52:47,022 --> 00:52:49,464
and thought about how it connected to my work in philosophy

1139
00:52:49,484 --> 00:52:51,266
and it made all these connections between the different games

1140
00:52:51,286 --> 00:52:53,188
and he asked really smart questions and I was like,

1141
00:52:54,109 --> 00:52:58,473
oh my god, there's so much more going on in my work than I realized.

1142
00:52:58,734 --> 00:52:58,894
Yeah.

1143
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:03,297
It really changed how I think about the work

1144
00:53:03,317 --> 00:53:04,517
that I had done previously and how

1145
00:53:04,577 --> 00:53:06,559
I thought about work going forward from that point.

1146
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:08,480
So this is something that can only

1147
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,462
happen if there's some kind of individual contact.

1148
00:53:11,662 --> 00:53:13,363
And I think that's one of the best gifts

1149
00:53:13,443 --> 00:53:14,644
that you can get from this.

1150
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:17,765
It really changed my perception of what press could be.

1151
00:53:17,805 --> 00:53:20,087
Because interrogating your own work as an artist

1152
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:21,368
is impossible.

1153
00:53:21,508 --> 00:53:22,448
It's so hard.

1154
00:53:22,788 --> 00:53:25,690
And then it turns out people are going to do that for you

1155
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:26,471
and tell you about it.

1156
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,551
That's amazing.

1157
00:53:29,933 --> 00:53:33,834
Hi, I'm Mathilde Pignon, and I just released the game.

1158
00:53:34,814 --> 00:53:38,695
It's an online multiplayer game, and I was actually

1159
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:44,417
advised to take my name off of it because in that genre,

1160
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:49,559
other developers have gotten death threats from players

1161
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:52,660
they have banned for cheating or bad behavior in the game.

1162
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:56,181
I'm just curious if you've experienced any kind of

1163
00:53:56,381 --> 00:53:59,082
harassment and how you might have dealt with that.

1164
00:54:01,908 --> 00:54:02,528
Yeah, a little bit.

1165
00:54:02,729 --> 00:54:04,409
I think in the genres that I work in,

1166
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:05,909
it's not as much of a problem.

1167
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:08,310
I think that was probably good advice

1168
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:10,631
that the person gave you in that context.

1169
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:12,772
And I think what Zach and I were trying to get across here

1170
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,872
is there are going to be situations where there's

1171
00:54:14,912 --> 00:54:17,173
some other considerations that should just overwhelm

1172
00:54:17,193 --> 00:54:17,853
all of these things.

1173
00:54:18,313 --> 00:54:23,395
Like if you're really worried about the particular base

1174
00:54:23,435 --> 00:54:23,875
of players.

1175
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:29,272
then that absolutely, absolutely, safety should come first, I think.

1176
00:54:29,492 --> 00:54:31,714
Yeah, I've never had harassment on one of my games,

1177
00:54:31,754 --> 00:54:35,135
but I did write a Polygon article a while ago that I got a lot of shit for.

1178
00:54:35,376 --> 00:54:36,076
Yeah.

1179
00:54:36,216 --> 00:54:38,177
And it was really scary and horrible.

1180
00:54:38,197 --> 00:54:39,878
It is horrible. That's like very real.

1181
00:54:39,898 --> 00:54:42,720
And I got just the tiniest amount of it.

1182
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,702
So, I mean, I think, as with everything,

1183
00:54:47,022 --> 00:54:50,564
being safe and comfortable and happy and having a good life

1184
00:54:50,644 --> 00:54:53,085
is kind of the most important thing that you can have.

1185
00:54:53,305 --> 00:54:53,465
But...

1186
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,407
I guess part of this talk is that when we were coming up with it,

1187
00:54:58,427 --> 00:55:01,568
we were starting to realize that, like, maybe there are things that we can do

1188
00:55:01,628 --> 00:55:05,589
that can sort of push the industry in a place where that isn't something

1189
00:55:05,689 --> 00:55:07,229
that we have to worry about quite as much.

1190
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:10,610
That, like, if we can engage with this uncomfortable thing

1191
00:55:11,070 --> 00:55:11,891
in a way that's safe,

1192
00:55:12,531 --> 00:55:14,652
then, like, maybe things will get a little bit better.

1193
00:55:18,344 --> 00:55:23,271
I have a hypothetical situation where you create a business with your own brand.

1194
00:55:24,213 --> 00:55:28,399
You still happen to have a business to accept money from Steam and iOS and stuff, but now

1195
00:55:28,419 --> 00:55:31,002
all of a sudden you're in legal trouble and now you need to fold the business that has

1196
00:55:31,022 --> 00:55:31,523
your name on it.

1197
00:55:31,723 --> 00:55:32,004
Oh yeah.

1198
00:55:32,244 --> 00:55:32,404
Yeah.

1199
00:55:32,765 --> 00:55:34,225
Oh, yeah, I would love to have a business.

1200
00:55:35,145 --> 00:55:35,786
I would love to.

1201
00:55:36,426 --> 00:55:38,867
But I can't, because I'm on a non-immigrant visa

1202
00:55:38,927 --> 00:55:39,667
in the United States.

1203
00:55:40,347 --> 00:55:43,048
You can also set up a sole proprietorship LLC.

1204
00:55:43,148 --> 00:55:44,608
My business does not have my name on it.

1205
00:55:44,788 --> 00:55:46,129
It's STFJ LLC.

1206
00:55:46,349 --> 00:55:48,270
But I do business under my own name.

1207
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:51,430
Right, and you've basically removed STFJ branding

1208
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:52,271
from your games as well.

1209
00:55:52,511 --> 00:55:55,272
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that that's not the legal entity.

1210
00:55:58,143 --> 00:56:01,208
Heather, Liam, I messed up my own name, sorry.

1211
00:56:01,589 --> 00:56:02,710
Liam Sobey, thanks for the talk.

1212
00:56:04,814 --> 00:56:07,799
So if there's one takeaway from the talk,

1213
00:56:07,859 --> 00:56:09,702
it's creating a human connection

1214
00:56:10,183 --> 00:56:11,344
from the game to the developer.

1215
00:56:12,373 --> 00:56:21,803
During the talk you expressed your displeasure, dissatisfaction with the streaming culture

1216
00:56:23,705 --> 00:56:24,866
surrounding games.

1217
00:56:26,587 --> 00:56:27,168
And being that...

1218
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:31,792
and getting over it is really all about the human connection of the game.

1219
00:56:32,192 --> 00:56:37,316
I was wondering why there was a strong choice in your marketing for the game,

1220
00:56:37,356 --> 00:56:40,778
particularly the trailer, where it was almost entirely focused on the streamers,

1221
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:42,960
on the people that weren't playing the game.

1222
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,641
Oh, that's not the main trailer.

1223
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,804
I made a streaming trailer after it had already blown up with streamers.

1224
00:56:47,924 --> 00:56:49,165
Oh, OK.

1225
00:56:49,225 --> 00:56:51,967
The main trailer I used to actually have in the talk.

1226
00:56:51,987 --> 00:56:53,188
I don't have it handy right now, but...

1227
00:56:54,295 --> 00:56:56,437
It starts out, this is just me, it's just playing the game.

1228
00:56:56,457 --> 00:56:59,180
And I say, why did I make this?

1229
00:57:00,901 --> 00:57:03,924
And then I suggest in that trailer

1230
00:57:03,964 --> 00:57:05,545
that there might be some people who

1231
00:57:05,605 --> 00:57:07,006
like this kind of horrible thing.

1232
00:57:07,707 --> 00:57:09,548
So in that trailer, what I'm actually doing

1233
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:11,931
is I'm saying, well, I'm a particular person.

1234
00:57:12,171 --> 00:57:13,031
I did a weird thing.

1235
00:57:13,051 --> 00:57:14,413
I made this strange game.

1236
00:57:15,113 --> 00:57:16,915
But I had in mind somebody who would like it,

1237
00:57:16,935 --> 00:57:17,876
a particular person.

1238
00:57:18,778 --> 00:57:20,618
And so I actually was framing it in that way

1239
00:57:20,818 --> 00:57:21,858
from the absolute beginning.

1240
00:57:22,419 --> 00:57:26,059
But I will say, as I said, I came in with some resentments

1241
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:27,660
about streaming culture.

1242
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,740
It felt like it was kind of feeding this disconnect.

1243
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,861
But I think I was just wrong.

1244
00:57:32,061 --> 00:57:35,461
One of the things that I came to grips with through the process

1245
00:57:35,541 --> 00:57:38,342
was just to have more respect for that

1246
00:57:39,342 --> 00:57:42,103
and to understand the human dimension of people watching

1247
00:57:42,123 --> 00:57:43,203
games being streamed as well.

1248
00:57:44,603 --> 00:57:45,143
Wonderful, thank you.

1249
00:57:46,711 --> 00:57:47,512
Hi.

1250
00:57:47,692 --> 00:57:49,154
So first off, thanks.

1251
00:57:49,234 --> 00:57:52,857
Secondly, so you talked a little bit about, Zach, you

1252
00:57:52,877 --> 00:57:55,860
talked about being kind of thrown into the public scene

1253
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,184
and maybe not necessarily anticipating the degree of

1254
00:58:00,244 --> 00:58:01,886
attention or the amount of attention you'd get.

1255
00:58:02,186 --> 00:58:05,609
Bennett, you talked about essentially being messaged

1256
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:07,111
every time someone finished your game.

1257
00:58:07,211 --> 00:58:08,793
And both of those sound kind of.

1258
00:58:09,173 --> 00:58:12,796
invasive in terms of personal life, so I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about

1259
00:58:12,816 --> 00:58:18,661
the balance between kind of personal and professional, where that fell apart, and how you survived

1260
00:58:18,721 --> 00:58:19,662
just as a human.

1261
00:58:19,682 --> 00:58:23,184
Do you want to start this?

1262
00:58:23,244 --> 00:58:24,285
Yeah, this is a hard question.

1263
00:58:24,305 --> 00:58:28,329
Yeah, I don't know.

1264
00:58:28,349 --> 00:58:38,197
I mean, my game is, even in the chat room, is not as unguarded as one of Nina Freeman's

1265
00:58:38,237 --> 00:58:38,497
games.

1266
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:40,790
it's at a certain remove.

1267
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:42,351
It's a professional remove.

1268
00:58:42,631 --> 00:58:44,592
I'm the game developer, you're the player.

1269
00:58:45,473 --> 00:58:48,854
And I'm giving away some of my thoughts about the game

1270
00:58:48,894 --> 00:58:51,015
and about playing games and about what it means

1271
00:58:51,055 --> 00:58:52,816
to confront challenge in that.

1272
00:58:52,836 --> 00:58:54,157
And that's personal, it's like real.

1273
00:58:54,717 --> 00:58:55,718
Those are my real feelings.

1274
00:58:55,798 --> 00:58:58,859
But I'm not telling them about my life

1275
00:58:58,959 --> 00:59:02,301
or giving them my home address or anything like that.

1276
00:59:02,841 --> 00:59:06,123
And that was how I felt I had to

1277
00:59:07,902 --> 00:59:11,867
protect myself and kind of maintain those boundaries.

1278
00:59:12,267 --> 00:59:13,849
And I don't think it's easy.

1279
00:59:13,869 --> 00:59:16,092
I think you have to kind of strike the right level.

1280
00:59:16,132 --> 00:59:17,594
It's going to be different for every game as well.

1281
00:59:17,614 --> 00:59:20,878
And some games are about somebody's personal experience.

1282
00:59:21,238 --> 00:59:22,860
I could never do what Tale of Tales

1283
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,403
did with the naked body scans.

1284
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,663
that just for me would be impossible.

1285
00:59:28,903 --> 00:59:32,007
But it's just gonna be different in every case.

1286
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:35,811
Yeah, I think, I guess I probably have two processes.

1287
00:59:35,851 --> 00:59:38,835
So one is if I'm thinking about doing a work,

1288
00:59:39,684 --> 00:59:41,606
and something is uncomfortable, I

1289
00:59:41,646 --> 00:59:44,089
think it's important to engage with that discomfort

1290
00:59:44,149 --> 00:59:44,889
and to think about it.

1291
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:48,253
A lot of this stuff, this has been such a weird talk for me

1292
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:50,995
because I don't care about any of this business stuff.

1293
00:59:51,035 --> 00:59:53,017
And it's weird for me to put up a slide that

1294
00:59:53,037 --> 00:59:56,981
has all the clippings that would be on my mom's fridge

1295
00:59:57,001 --> 00:59:57,362
or whatever.

1296
00:59:57,442 --> 00:59:57,782
Like that's.

1297
00:59:58,543 --> 01:00:05,832
fucking weird. But I felt like there was like a value in engaging with that discomfort because

1298
01:00:05,872 --> 01:00:11,178
I'm trying to convince you of something that I think is really important. And on that level,

1299
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:16,124
dealing with discomfort, it's like worth it to engage it because I'm doing it on my terms.

1300
01:00:16,785 --> 01:00:20,367
In terms of after a game is out, how people are reacting to it,

1301
01:00:20,987 --> 01:00:22,288
if something makes me uncomfortable,

1302
01:00:22,448 --> 01:00:25,070
I just leave it alone, or I don't read the reviews

1303
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:27,271
for a week, or I block a key.

1304
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:30,373
At that point, once you're not creating something,

1305
01:00:30,473 --> 01:00:33,155
then you should just be focusing on how can I

1306
01:00:33,635 --> 01:00:34,696
lead a happy, healthy life?

1307
01:00:37,577 --> 01:00:39,438
continue to create work and feel comfortable,

1308
01:00:39,498 --> 01:00:40,618
like then it's okay to,

1309
01:00:40,658 --> 01:00:42,818
because it's not on your terms anymore.

1310
01:00:42,878 --> 01:00:44,219
Now it's like shared with people

1311
01:00:44,279 --> 01:00:46,059
and it's gonna be the same kind of interaction

1312
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:46,979
that you would have anywhere.

1313
01:00:47,419 --> 01:00:49,900
If someone started talking to you at a party

1314
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:51,560
and it was uncomfortable, you'd walk away.

1315
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,181
And that's fine, you don't have to,

1316
01:00:53,421 --> 01:00:55,881
that there's no additional value to engaging with.

1317
01:00:56,081 --> 01:00:56,861
Awesome, thank you.

1318
01:00:58,222 --> 01:00:58,522
Time?

1319
01:00:58,602 --> 01:00:58,802
Cool.

1320
01:00:58,822 --> 01:00:59,882
All right, thanks very much everybody.

1321
01:00:59,902 --> 01:01:00,482
Thank you.
