1
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:23,721
this. So cameras. Whoa, that's loud. Historically cameras in games have sort of been an

2
00:00:23,821 --> 00:00:27,945
afterthought for a lot of game teams. Game plays and cinematic.

3
00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:34,691
Usually it's sort of a last minute thing to assign it to somebody, give somebody ownership over the cameras.

4
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:39,578
And oftentimes that person doesn't have a lot of real world camera experience.

5
00:00:41,992 --> 00:00:46,677
it's getting better but we still have a ways to go to catch up to film and television. So what

6
00:00:46,697 --> 00:00:52,182
I'm hoping to do in this pretty brief talk is give a basic understanding of how cameras work

7
00:00:52,242 --> 00:00:59,048
and function. Move on to how that applies to composition and then wrap that up with how that

8
00:00:59,088 --> 00:01:01,190
ties into games. Excuse me.

9
00:01:04,878 --> 00:01:11,303
First a little bit of info about me. I've been animating for games for just about 14 years now.

10
00:01:12,384 --> 00:01:19,810
These are some of the games I've worked on. Many of which you can find in the... Oh, people are

11
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:27,776
supposed to move in towards the center if you can. It's getting crowded. Thank you. Yeah, so

12
00:01:27,816 --> 00:01:31,759
these are the games I've worked on. A lot of them you can find in Jay's bargain bin that he

13
00:01:31,779 --> 00:01:32,260
talked about.

14
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:41,409
14 years, I spent about 9 years at EA, a lot of sports games. I then moved to Square Enix, was

15
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:47,351
animation director on Hitman. And I am now in LA at a company called Robotokey where we're

16
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:54,494
working on Human Element right now. It's a first person survival game. Much of my career has

17
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:59,396
been spent in cinematics, focused on a lot of story telling through characters, through

18
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:04,098
cameras and a lot of those fun things. So let's jump right into it.

19
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:09,647
As animators, when we begin animating a character, we're looking at a lot of reference. We

20
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:14,290
gather a lot of our photos and videos and stuff like that. Thumbnailing. Even running around

21
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:24,738
the studio doing our own moves, acting like goofs. Thanks, Zach, for the video. But how often do we

22
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:28,601
do this when we're about to animate a camera? Is it still going? Let's watch the whole thing.

23
00:02:33,591 --> 00:02:36,212
how cameras work and how they function,

24
00:02:36,693 --> 00:02:37,953
the language of cinematography,

25
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:40,935
it's remained largely unchanged for decades.

26
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,316
And we've grown up seeing our stories told

27
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:45,257
through the eyes of these physical cameras.

28
00:02:45,717 --> 00:02:46,398
So because of this,

29
00:02:47,138 --> 00:02:50,100
CG camera can often fall victim to the same thing

30
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,401
that characters can, and that's the uncanny valley.

31
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,701
You can see this a lot in films like the bullet time sequences

32
00:02:58,781 --> 00:03:00,842
in the Matrix films.

33
00:03:01,363 --> 00:03:02,983
Sometimes it's maybe a little more subtle,

34
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:04,224
like a Michael Bay film.

35
00:03:08,486 --> 00:03:12,828
But I think if we can understand the basic physiology of how

36
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:14,589
cameras do function and work, then we

37
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:17,490
can apply that to our CG, which will help us create

38
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,511
some more believable movements, some more believable

39
00:03:20,031 --> 00:03:20,651
compositions.

40
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:27,771
At first cameras can seem really daunting. There's a lot of moving parts, a lot of controls,

41
00:03:28,231 --> 00:03:33,314
even CG cameras have tons of things to key frame. But really when you break it down into its

42
00:03:33,334 --> 00:03:37,356
simplest parts you only have a few things to control. You have the lens, the aperture, the

43
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:45,280
shutter speed and where you position it and how you move these cameras. So for lenses, it

44
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:49,087
it doesn't, sorry, move this.

45
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:51,868
When it comes to lenses, choosing a longer

46
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:53,928
or shorter focal length isn't just about

47
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:56,449
how far the camera happens to be from the subject.

48
00:03:57,269 --> 00:03:59,650
Every lens distorts the image in a slightly different way.

49
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,610
Shorter focal lengths give you a wider field of view,

50
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,991
but also creates greater depth and separation

51
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:07,971
between your focal points.

52
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:13,533
A longer focal length gives a much narrower field of view,

53
00:04:13,573 --> 00:04:16,313
but it also flattens the image, as you can see here.

54
00:04:18,112 --> 00:04:22,754
Um, this is something to keep in mind, especially when you're shooting characters. Uh, as

55
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:26,495
your lens can distort the, the facial features and sometimes take the character off model

56
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:30,917
before you've even animated it. Uh, this is the difference between a 300 mil and a 25 mil

57
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:36,339
lens. Uh, and you can see how you can easily break your character without, uh, being careful

58
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:40,860
about how you choose your lenses. Uh, when it comes to aperture...

59
00:04:41,993 --> 00:04:47,154
It refers to the little diaphragm that controls how much light enters the camera. What it also

60
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:53,696
does is it changes the depth of field. The area considered in focus is called the circle of

61
00:04:53,756 --> 00:04:57,017
confusion. That's that little place between the two brackets there, the focal point in the

62
00:04:57,057 --> 00:05:06,139
middle. If you change the amount of light coming in, you adjust the circle of confusion there.

63
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,060
And you can see how

64
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:15,643
letting in more light, moving the focal point closer

65
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:19,206
or further away from the camera can also affect this.

66
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,671
Unfortunately, in a lot of games,

67
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:29,375
this is what our depth of field ends up looking like.

68
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,717
We've got a very distinct range that's

69
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:34,145
perfectly in focus, then a sharp drop off,

70
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:36,987
and then a place that's evenly out of focus.

71
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:40,749
You see this used a lot in games,

72
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:42,690
especially as a tool to highlight something

73
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,091
or separate it from its background.

74
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:50,219
If our goal is immersion in the universe, anything that sort of reminds us that we're looking

75
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:54,062
through the eyes of a CG or simulated environment kind of breaks that immersion.

76
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,265
Another unfortunate side effect is this miniaturizes your characters

77
00:05:58,326 --> 00:05:59,406
or your environment a little bit.

78
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:02,068
They look like little toy figures instead of something

79
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:04,570
that was shot through a physical camera.

80
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:07,573
Sorry if anybody here is from Rise.

81
00:06:07,713 --> 00:06:08,693
I just called you guys up.

82
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:15,143
Instead of relying solely on depth of field to focus the

83
00:06:15,163 --> 00:06:17,223
viewer's attention, we could be using a lot of the other tools

84
00:06:17,263 --> 00:06:21,244
we have on hand. We've got lighting, use of negative space,

85
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:24,845
leading lines, contrast of tone and value. Limbo here, for

86
00:06:24,905 --> 00:06:29,186
example, was a great use of negative space and contrast of

87
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:29,526
tone.

88
00:06:31,437 --> 00:06:34,979
This next one from Rise is actually a really great shot.

89
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,660
They framed the character in the doorway,

90
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:40,322
used sort of a contrast of detail,

91
00:06:40,342 --> 00:06:42,444
the character in the foreground's highly detailed

92
00:06:42,464 --> 00:06:44,865
where the background is starting to use more abstract shapes

93
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:48,788
and leading lines and contrast of tone

94
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:50,669
sort of draws you to the character.

95
00:06:51,823 --> 00:06:57,229
This last one's another really great example, but on the opposite side of the scale. It's quite evenly detailed. There's a

96
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,792
saturation of detail across it, but what they've done is

97
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:03,595
they've used a lot of tonal contrast and leading lines.

98
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:08,120
You can see the branches leading in. The brightest point in this image is

99
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,705
where they want you to look. Even the characters driving in towards us, those two guys on the upper right.

100
00:07:14,865 --> 00:07:18,688
another really cool thing, how they've used contrastive tone

101
00:07:18,868 --> 00:07:21,550
is if you look down sort of the center bottom, there's a guy

102
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,352
there who's also an enemy wearing red in a green forest.

103
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:27,753
So he stands out clearly, doesn't belong there, he's not

104
00:07:27,793 --> 00:07:37,480
part of that. Something to pay attention to. Sorry. So

105
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:41,360
The third thing we have control over is shutter speed.

106
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,641
So typically in games, this isn't something

107
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:46,363
that's as illustrated as often as it could be.

108
00:07:46,403 --> 00:07:48,204
We're starting to get there now with our newer engines.

109
00:07:49,304 --> 00:07:50,685
This can be represented a number of ways.

110
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:53,367
Exposure, motion blur, even frame rate.

111
00:07:55,728 --> 00:07:57,490
As I said, we're not using them so much now,

112
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,571
but modern engines are starting to take motion blur

113
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:02,272
into account, and it is helping.

114
00:08:03,657 --> 00:08:08,439
smooth movement out and again create a more believable experience.

115
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,643
The last main area we have control over this is where we position the camera and how we

116
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:20,985
move it. As I mentioned before, cinematography and camera work hasn't really changed much.

117
00:08:21,045 --> 00:08:25,307
That language we're very used to seeing and we're very used to getting our stories through

118
00:08:25,347 --> 00:08:31,029
this. When something breaks really sharply from this, we can run into that issue of the

119
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:31,950
uncanny valley again.

120
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:39,108
never more evident than at the start of the CGI craze. Flying cameras and crazy slow-mo

121
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:45,770
sequences. I'm not really selling their creative use short, but just because we can do

122
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:53,452
something in CG doesn't mean we should. Always. So the tools that we use for film are fairly

123
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:58,513
basic. There's jib crane, tripod, steady cam, dolly. There's a lot of other stuff that

124
00:08:59,245 --> 00:09:01,445
these are constraints we're accustomed to viewing these

125
00:09:01,485 --> 00:09:05,487
through, but how often do we rig them like this? We do this with

126
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:08,128
our characters, we study their physiology, where all the bones

127
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:12,789
are in a lion, a giraffe or anything, but we don't typically

128
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:19,932
do this with cameras. I wanted to show this short clip from an

129
00:09:19,972 --> 00:09:23,373
Assassin's Creed trailer. If you could pay really close

130
00:09:23,393 --> 00:09:23,953
attention, they've...

131
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:29,474
They've really added a lot of subtle organic dirt, basically,

132
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:30,274
onto the camera.

133
00:09:30,294 --> 00:09:33,136
And it feels like there's a physical cameraman

134
00:09:33,236 --> 00:09:35,177
in the scene filming this.

135
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,900
Adding just a little bit of that goes a long, long way

136
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,182
to creating a believable experience.

137
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:47,145
Just let this play out.

138
00:09:57,508 --> 00:10:01,809
but it's really nice, the subtle movements, the little imperfections, because at the end of the

139
00:10:01,849 --> 00:10:06,910
day, when we watch these, regardless of how smooth they try to move the jib crane, how smooth

140
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,591
the dolly tracks are, there's still a human operating that camera and there's still little

141
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:18,492
imperfections that go into that movement. So taking these basic mechanics, how a camera

142
00:10:18,512 --> 00:10:21,973
functions, let's just move on to composition.

143
00:10:24,815 --> 00:10:27,897
By now, most everybody's heard of thirds, the rule of thirds.

144
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:30,680
It's a pretty safe bet that just placing your focal point,

145
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,942
your character's eyes, or something

146
00:10:33,002 --> 00:10:35,123
along any of those intersection points

147
00:10:35,244 --> 00:10:37,666
is going to create a sort of a pleasing composition.

148
00:10:37,706 --> 00:10:41,028
But I want us to start thinking about why we're choosing

149
00:10:41,068 --> 00:10:42,129
to put that character there.

150
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:43,591
What is the purpose of that?

151
00:10:45,032 --> 00:10:46,313
I've got a couple more to show for this.

152
00:10:46,673 --> 00:10:49,035
But what are you trying to elicit from the audience?

153
00:10:49,135 --> 00:10:51,337
What are you trying to communicate?

154
00:10:54,906 --> 00:10:56,228
So example for this shot.

155
00:10:58,412 --> 00:10:59,815
Feels a lot different than this one.

156
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:05,886
I've used the same shot, same expression, same rule,

157
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:07,829
same rule of thirds, but in the first one.

158
00:11:09,287 --> 00:11:12,587
I'm up against the edge of the frame and there's not a lot of

159
00:11:12,627 --> 00:11:16,549
movement, nowhere to go. It actually has a sense of wonder,

160
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:19,989
there's something fantastic in front of me. Whereas this one

161
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,070
there's sort of a sense of impending danger, there's

162
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,731
something about to crush me. Really it's just using the same

163
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:27,692
thing but just choosing to use different scale and different

164
00:11:27,732 --> 00:11:34,113
position on the frame. I love this shot. This sequence if you

165
00:11:34,133 --> 00:11:35,774
haven't seen it, everybody's seen Forrest Gump, right?

166
00:11:38,005 --> 00:11:39,847
It's a very, very deliberate use of thirds.

167
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:42,109
Forrest has been running, he's been running for over a year,

168
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:43,310
I can't remember exactly how long,

169
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,893
and he gets to the end of his run,

170
00:11:46,353 --> 00:11:47,495
and he's run out of frame,

171
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:49,737
metaphorically, visually, everything.

172
00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:51,859
His return home is behind him,

173
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,682
and it's a great representation

174
00:11:54,722 --> 00:11:57,024
of how he's just hit the end of his willpower,

175
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:58,806
his whatever journey he was on.

176
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:05,467
What also sort of emphasizes this in the movie is that almost the entire movie,

177
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:06,849
and I encourage you to go back and watch it,

178
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:11,496
Forrest is framed dead center in the frame for most of the film.

179
00:12:12,277 --> 00:12:13,239
Anytime there's a big.

180
00:12:13,752 --> 00:12:17,954
sort of changing moment for him and his character arc or anything like that, then he starts to be

181
00:12:18,014 --> 00:12:22,516
put on a third or so. There's movement in the frame, but for the rest of it, he's a very neutral

182
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:28,658
character in his universe. It's the external characters that are the sort of extremes in his

183
00:12:28,718 --> 00:12:32,640
life that come in and out. And this is such a great sort of illustration of that being very

184
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:39,002
deliberate with how you choose the thirds. One of my favorite characters, directors who most

185
00:12:39,162 --> 00:12:39,963
notably uses.

186
00:12:40,898 --> 00:12:43,661
composition in a very deliberate manner as Wes Anderson.

187
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:49,766
Any of his films are absolutely just a course on how to use

188
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:52,389
composition to tell a story.

189
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:31,117
So one common issue that we do run into is the unintentional use of tangents. Tangent, the

190
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:36,220
dictionary definition of a tangent is a straight line or plane that touches a curved or curved

191
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,062
surface. But sort of for our purposes it's more of a general.

192
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:46,717
thing that any time two lines touch but don't cross over. You can see this a lot in film and

193
00:13:46,737 --> 00:13:50,580
TV and when used deliberately it's great because it draws your eyes exactly to where you want to

194
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:55,023
but a lot of times this is done unintentionally and it can take the viewer's eyes away from what

195
00:13:55,063 --> 00:14:01,648
you wanted to them. Some common sort of uses, you can see this like heads touching the top

196
00:14:01,668 --> 00:14:04,890
of the frame. This is a very, very common one. You can either

197
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:11,155
crop in or pull back to get rid of this, but your eyes are sort of drawn to these intersections.

198
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:15,677
A couple more shots of heads touching the top.

199
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:22,239
How much control converging lines have over the viewer's attention is something that's

200
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:25,561
actually been measured. There are several companies that test all sorts of things

201
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:32,623
with eye tracking software and they can see what visual stimuli draw people's attention.

202
00:14:33,434 --> 00:14:34,975
and they've created heat maps to show this.

203
00:14:35,015 --> 00:14:38,457
And you can see on here, there's a vanishing point at the end of the tracks.

204
00:14:39,017 --> 00:14:41,619
They were drawn to that immediately, but now there's a point of contrast

205
00:14:41,659 --> 00:14:44,680
where there's movement and a darker object in the scene, and they're drawn to that.

206
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,942
And you can see, as this camera pans through this shot,

207
00:14:48,963 --> 00:14:52,084
when there's ambiguous space and there's not a lot of focal points,

208
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:54,065
you see them darting all over, darting all over.

209
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,787
The size of these is relative to how long they stayed on that area.

210
00:14:56,807 --> 00:14:59,648
But you can see they're searching, searching, searching.

211
00:14:59,668 --> 00:15:01,830
They're finding contrast points, finding contrast points.

212
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,270
Then there's movement, and they're on it.

213
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:09,069
and it's really telling how people sort of see your stories

214
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,710
and to be very deliberate about what choices you're giving them

215
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:17,533
to focus on is super, super important. I'll let this finish

216
00:15:17,613 --> 00:15:20,294
out. But you can see as it goes behind the building now they're

217
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:21,975
looking around, looking around.

218
00:15:30,478 --> 00:15:35,659
A while back, Chris Roman storyboard notes from The Simpsons was circulated a lot, and

219
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,701
this became sort of, I think, a little bit taken too literally. A lot of their notes

220
00:15:40,781 --> 00:15:46,622
were that to always switch from a two-plane focus to more of a three-plane, always show

221
00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:49,083
three planes to create a more dynamic angle.

222
00:15:51,677 --> 00:15:58,139
Using this you can usually get pleasing shots, but you're ignoring the use of a lot of other uses of

223
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:05,702
space. So you've got limited, flat, deep or even ambiguous space. Flat space in its most basic

224
00:16:05,742 --> 00:16:12,945
definition is a two dimensional thing. There's not a lot of perspective or vanishing points. The

225
00:16:12,985 --> 00:16:14,485
opposite side of that is deep space.

226
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:19,526
one or more vanishing points, spacing and scale of objects

227
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:21,547
or focal points, creating the feeling of depth.

228
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:26,371
Limited space is sort of a combination of the two.

229
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:28,833
You can kind of think of it as a diorama.

230
00:16:28,853 --> 00:16:32,556
You've got multiple planes of two-dimensional space

231
00:16:32,656 --> 00:16:35,819
playing on different layers from the camera.

232
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,782
Wes Anderson, again, uses this quite a bit.

233
00:16:40,383 --> 00:16:41,964
Hitchcock did a lot as well.

234
00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:50,094
The last one is ambiguous space. This removes any cues of depth and places the viewer in a much

235
00:16:50,214 --> 00:16:55,697
more uncertain state about where they are. And this can be a very, very useful tool for

236
00:16:56,478 --> 00:17:01,881
creating unease in your viewer. A lot of these can be used to sort of elicit specific

237
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:06,524
reactions, like I said. Using too much of any in a sequence can do the opposite. You can

238
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:09,485
start to devalue what you're trying to accomplish.

239
00:17:11,016 --> 00:17:12,637
but juxtaposing them next to each other,

240
00:17:12,677 --> 00:17:15,438
creating strong contrast, then you can maintain that.

241
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:17,900
You could use this in a game.

242
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,321
Say you were making a game where half of it

243
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:22,702
was spent inside a mech or inside of a base,

244
00:17:22,762 --> 00:17:24,983
but the other half was spent in a large open world.

245
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:28,105
Contrasting that with sort of a limited or flat space.

246
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,186
But then when you're out in the world,

247
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:31,747
it's much stronger if there's dynamic angles, wide angle

248
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:33,868
lenses, and things like that, instead of always shooting

249
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,130
like Michael Bay and everything's a beer commercial.

250
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:46,328
So, flat space, deep space are often used to, plus story

251
00:17:46,368 --> 00:17:49,051
moments, flat space is also used in a lot of comedy, you'll

252
00:17:49,091 --> 00:17:54,277
notice, to punctuate the comedic moments. Deep space is very

253
00:17:54,317 --> 00:17:57,061
dramatic, very emotional.

254
00:18:00,139 --> 00:18:06,483
Other tools you can use, negative space and contrast of tone or value. Negative space is a

255
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:13,807
low detail, sort of blank space next to a high detail or strong silhouette. Another tool,

256
00:18:13,867 --> 00:18:20,790
contrast of tone or value, using light and dark, contrasting colors, draw the viewer's eye to

257
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,932
where you want them to look. Another example.

258
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:32,156
This also employs vanishing points and leading lines to just suck you right into where he wanted you to look.

259
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:36,699
The opposite, this is a good example of ambiguous space.

260
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:40,520
Sometimes you don't want to create a sharp, sharp thing.

261
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,382
You want more of an ambiguity in your shot.

262
00:18:43,842 --> 00:18:45,883
You want to show that your character is in a safe place.

263
00:18:46,003 --> 00:18:49,965
If there's continuity of tone and pattern like you can see here.

264
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:51,786
This is a great shot.

265
00:18:53,676 --> 00:18:56,217
Zach Braff's character is in sort of a very ambiguous place

266
00:18:56,257 --> 00:19:00,719
in this point in the story. He's returned home for a funeral. It

267
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:03,760
really conveys perfectly the feeling that he wanted to give

268
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,681
the viewer at this point. Even the choice to place him sort of

269
00:19:06,801 --> 00:19:11,083
dead center in the frame was very deliberate and effective. At

270
00:19:11,123 --> 00:19:15,445
this point he's sort of juxtaposed with his expression.

271
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:18,726
It's perfect. Such an awkward shot. And it's really, really

272
00:19:18,786 --> 00:19:21,347
memorable. Alternatively, if you reverse this.

273
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,040
you can make the character feel a bit more tense.

274
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,861
And this is such a great shot that sort of echoes

275
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,542
who these characters are and what split sides

276
00:19:32,562 --> 00:19:33,202
of his personality.

277
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:34,663
You see Edward Norton framed.

278
00:19:34,703 --> 00:19:35,603
It's all grays.

279
00:19:35,683 --> 00:19:36,703
It's very linear.

280
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:37,744
Everything's perpendicular.

281
00:19:37,764 --> 00:19:40,064
You see Brad Pitt's silhouette.

282
00:19:40,104 --> 00:19:40,864
Everything's jaggy.

283
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:42,105
It's bright, saturated colors.

284
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:43,225
Even got the brown doorway.

285
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:44,886
He's not quite framed properly.

286
00:19:44,926 --> 00:19:48,546
So you can see it's a visual representation

287
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:50,047
of who these guys are as characters.

288
00:19:52,327 --> 00:19:55,489
So moving the camera during the shot should also be a very

289
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,811
deliberate choice. If done without consideration, maybe

290
00:19:58,851 --> 00:20:02,834
too frequently, you could again, you'd be diluting the value and

291
00:20:02,854 --> 00:20:06,036
the effectiveness of the tool that you have. For example,

292
00:20:06,076 --> 00:20:09,117
it's become really, really popular to do first person

293
00:20:09,658 --> 00:20:14,561
cameras. This sort of POV style movement says to the viewer that

294
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:17,002
they're looking through the eyes of somebody that's in the scene.

295
00:20:17,142 --> 00:20:21,605
And if this is not what you're trying to convey, then you're

296
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:21,825
sort of...

297
00:20:22,943 --> 00:20:29,945
you're diluting your currency. Battlestar Galactica was I think a big reason why we've got a

298
00:20:29,986 --> 00:20:36,728
lot of these crazy rack focuses and stuff like that these days. Again, if you use this too

299
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:46,732
much, Michael Bay, you're just, it's confusing, it's tiring to watch and you're sort of, what

300
00:20:46,772 --> 00:20:49,793
did I do? Michael Bay, right?

301
00:20:53,732 --> 00:21:00,899
All right. So all this is fine for cinematics but what about gameplay? First person game

302
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:05,904
with a camera is the character. The limits on what we can get away with are quite limiting.

303
00:21:06,084 --> 00:21:11,449
FOV and depth of field. Any time you take controller away from the user, you run the risk of

304
00:21:11,489 --> 00:21:19,476
breaking immersion. Any changes you make need to be done subtly in a very natural way.

305
00:21:20,536 --> 00:21:24,277
it's very easy to pull the character out. Small changes,

306
00:21:24,698 --> 00:21:28,139
going from stationary to faster movement to illustrate speed.

307
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,561
Going from indoors to outdoors, because sometimes it actually

308
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:36,462
serves gameplay as well to have a greater field of view. And

309
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:39,263
sometimes you can get away with a little bit of control, taking

310
00:21:39,303 --> 00:21:42,725
control away from the user to interact with objects in the

311
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:44,745
scene, but it does need to be done in a very subtle way. I

312
00:21:46,746 --> 00:21:47,847
think this is just about done.

313
00:22:04,684 --> 00:22:04,985
One more.

314
00:22:06,006 --> 00:22:10,073
As you can see here during the roll, or during, yeah,

315
00:22:10,113 --> 00:22:12,316
interacting with this electrical box,

316
00:22:12,356 --> 00:22:15,521
you can see it took control, but it was a very fluid control.

317
00:22:17,925 --> 00:22:18,646
And third person.

318
00:22:20,195 --> 00:22:22,616
have a little more control over the camera and where you place

319
00:22:22,656 --> 00:22:26,598
it. You can see some differences here when entering and exiting

320
00:22:26,698 --> 00:22:30,240
cover situations or actually there's a good spot here where

321
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:33,641
as he goes indoors in this watchdog clip. You can see we

322
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:37,623
push in a little bit more. Creating more of a confined

323
00:22:37,683 --> 00:22:42,026
feeling. It's a very deliberate choice. You can also, to

324
00:22:43,786 --> 00:22:45,967
communicate objectives or things like that, you can take some

325
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:48,629
slight control away from the user.

326
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,763
they do this in combat sequences

327
00:22:53,783 --> 00:22:53,843
uh...

328
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:08,198
So regarding field of view, it's a common misconception that FOV size is directly related to

329
00:23:08,258 --> 00:23:13,319
motion sickness. Like this. This is basically I just took a camera and I constrained it

330
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:18,100
directly to the head of a character running. Wider FOV sort of reduces this, but it's just

331
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:23,681
movement relative to what's in frame. We were looking into this a little bit at Robotoki and

332
00:23:23,742 --> 00:23:27,002
one of the teammates sort of realized that if you stabilize the horizon,

333
00:23:27,462 --> 00:23:31,224
you don't need to eliminate the movement, but it actually does reduce, well he was getting

334
00:23:31,324 --> 00:23:35,367
violently sick one day because somebody changed the value in a camera during our play test and

335
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:41,870
he couldn't play it for more than two minutes. This is the exact same thing, just with the

336
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,552
horizon stable. There's no difference in the camera movement at all, but it's a much more

337
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:50,455
stable experience. All I did was stabilize the rotation relative to the horizon.

338
00:23:51,553 --> 00:24:02,498
Why this is, I think, is because as humans we've evolved a number of stabilizing mechanisms to maintain sort of visual stability on objects, whether it's a predator or prey or anything like that.

339
00:24:03,498 --> 00:24:15,023
There's some really complex things that do this. We've got the vestibular ocular, vestibular colic, and vestibular spinal, and that all works sort of in tandem to maintain still head movement, still eyes.

340
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,682
And if anything breaks that, we start jittering around and rotating the camera wildly.

341
00:24:20,702 --> 00:24:21,562
It's counter to that.

342
00:24:21,822 --> 00:24:27,284
And it feels unnatural, we feel queasy, and you've, again, you're watching a Michael Bay movie.

343
00:24:28,184 --> 00:24:38,127
Um, it's, it's, again, it's an evolutionary thing and, uh, it's hard to run away from a bear if you can't see straight, so.

344
00:24:38,968 --> 00:24:39,028
Um.

345
00:24:40,236 --> 00:24:43,962
I think that is just about it. I'm going to leave you guys with some reading material.

346
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:49,230
This was very light coverage. This is something that could take forever to cover all the little

347
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:49,430
bits.

348
00:24:50,275 --> 00:24:53,796
I cannot recommend these two books enough. Bare bones camera

349
00:24:53,816 --> 00:24:57,877
course by Tim Schroepel which was one of the first books ever

350
00:24:57,917 --> 00:25:01,738
given to me when I started animating. It literally is a bare

351
00:25:01,778 --> 00:25:04,299
bones book. There's stick figures to illustrate how to

352
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:07,799
frame things. It's a great short read. The next one which is a

353
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,100
bit more advanced is a visual story from Bruce Block. I had

354
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,581
the chance to see him speak at a SIG graph once and completely

355
00:25:14,621 --> 00:25:17,462
changed how I look at composing shots. I definitely

356
00:25:18,187 --> 00:25:27,496
suggest reading that. As far as websites, check out the seven golden camels. Mark Kennedy who

357
00:25:27,656 --> 00:25:35,604
writes this is a story artist at Disney and he was the lead story artist for Tangled and it's

358
00:25:35,664 --> 00:25:41,490
just so full of amazing information. Definitely go check that out.

359
00:25:43,061 --> 00:25:48,266
And that is about it. I think I have about five minutes for questions. And as always...

360
00:25:48,906 --> 00:25:54,932
Is that not showing up? There it is. Yeah, you can... I love talking about this stuff, so feel

361
00:25:54,972 --> 00:26:00,737
free to contact me or come grab me afterwards. And yeah, maybe four minutes for questions.

362
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:13,113
No questions.

363
00:26:13,233 --> 00:26:13,574
All right.

364
00:26:13,594 --> 00:26:15,039
That was perfectly clear.

365
00:26:16,524 --> 00:26:16,825
Thanks.
