1
00:00:05,502 --> 00:00:10,744
Alright, good morning everybody. Thanks Joel for the introduction. This is a little design in a day and

2
00:00:11,764 --> 00:00:34,511
this is a talk, a topic that's near and dear to my heart, solving puzzle design. A bit of a background on me, I began my career at Telltale Games as a cinematic artist and a designer and now I'm a level designer at Ubisoft Studio SF just around the corner on the new South Park RPG, The Fractured But Whole. Think about it.

3
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:38,596
So why puzzles?

4
00:00:39,616 --> 00:00:41,957
I love puzzles because designing a good puzzle

5
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:45,838
means you're combining tons of different concepts

6
00:00:45,918 --> 00:00:48,518
in game design all together to make a really cool

7
00:00:49,098 --> 00:00:51,439
unit of game, a good game nugget.

8
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,940
So you have your mechanics, your level design,

9
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,081
your narrative, balancing your difficulty, progression.

10
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,281
These are all things that go into puzzles

11
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:02,382
that make a puzzle a great experience for a player.

12
00:01:04,037 --> 00:01:07,260
So in this talk, I'm just going to start with exactly what a puzzle is,

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,161
defining that in the context of level design,

14
00:01:10,022 --> 00:01:11,403
talk about what makes a puzzle good,

15
00:01:12,344 --> 00:01:14,326
and then we're going to go into the elements of a puzzle,

16
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:16,487
rational puzzle design,

17
00:01:17,128 --> 00:01:17,969
how to build a puzzle,

18
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:21,612
and then some tips for troubleshooting puzzles when they just don't make sense.

19
00:01:23,313 --> 00:01:24,954
So let's start off with what is a puzzle.

20
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:34,077
So puzzles are kind of hard to define. Again, we have the level design domain to kind of work within.

21
00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:42,884
But in general, one of my favorite definitions for puzzles is it's a game with a dominant strategy,

22
00:01:43,064 --> 00:01:49,530
which is when you have choices that are offered to a player, but one of them is clearly better than the rest.

23
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:53,097
Now this usually is not a good thing in game design.

24
00:01:53,117 --> 00:01:56,023
You want a player to be able to choose what they want to do.

25
00:01:56,464 --> 00:01:59,269
You want them to have decisions they can make.

26
00:02:00,657 --> 00:02:02,379
But you can still have that with a dominant strategy.

27
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,142
And that's because puzzles are games with one solution.

28
00:02:07,182 --> 00:02:08,604
That's what they are inherently.

29
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,866
And that's because while games are played to win,

30
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:13,948
puzzles are played to find a solution.

31
00:02:13,988 --> 00:02:17,070
At their very heart, they are about finding that strategy.

32
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,112
So your gameplay finds in the challenge

33
00:02:19,312 --> 00:02:21,874
of getting that dominant strategy nailed down.

34
00:02:25,097 --> 00:02:27,979
So a puzzle is a challenge.

35
00:02:29,334 --> 00:02:36,239
But it's not a competitive challenge, it's the player stopping and thinking about a challenge that you as the designer have given them.

36
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,522
You know, adventure games are a great example of this, this is Grim Fandango.

37
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:49,949
You're gonna, you know, you're playing a detective, so it's all about finding clues, figuring out who you need to talk to next, learning about the world and applying that.

38
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:52,771
You're always stopping and thinking the way a detective would.

39
00:02:54,373 --> 00:02:58,315
I also have up here Angry Birds. Now Angry Birds is also a puzzle game because if you think about it,

40
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:03,497
there is a ideal way to destroy all the pigs in their home.

41
00:03:04,177 --> 00:03:07,058
That's a message with like the kind of the star system. There is a dominant,

42
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:11,180
an ideal way, a most efficient way, using the birds you have

43
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,722
to solve the puzzle of breaking a bunch of pigs' homes.

44
00:03:18,623 --> 00:03:19,823
So what makes a puzzle good?

45
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:22,204
Does anyone know?

46
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:28,411
So fun is important to a puzzle being good.

47
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:33,158
But that fun should come from the challenge.

48
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:41,165
And that challenge happens when the player feels a sense of trust and respect from the designer.

49
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:43,507
Now, how do you get that trust and respect?

50
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:49,412
You invite the player to find a solution. You don't hand them one. You let them try to find it themselves.

51
00:03:50,253 --> 00:03:52,335
But you also make sure that solution is attainable.

52
00:03:52,455 --> 00:03:57,079
You don't challenge, you don't, you know, be the awful GM who just kills all your players.

53
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:00,742
You're always letting them at least get out of the situation by their own merit.

54
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:07,759
And so, if you do achieve that, the player has a sense of accomplishment of getting through something themselves.

55
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,602
So, thinking about it that way, it's players learning how to get out of a situation.

56
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,224
Learning is fun.

57
00:04:19,045 --> 00:04:22,206
And learning is fun because knowledge is power.

58
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:27,369
You know, games are all about feeling powerful in your surroundings or well equipped to handle

59
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:28,110
a situation.

60
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,232
And so, providing knowledge, that provides power.

61
00:04:32,632 --> 00:04:36,334
And you know, when you're in a situation where you're stopping to think about a puzzle, feeling

62
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:38,235
powerful means knowing how to solve it.

63
00:04:40,402 --> 00:04:43,604
So this is a talk that was at GDC last year.

64
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:45,066
It's called Precision of Emotion,

65
00:04:45,226 --> 00:04:46,206
a New Kind of Fun Approach.

66
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:49,809
And this was given by a woman named Erin Hoffman.

67
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:54,592
And her theory on fun is that the search for knowledge

68
00:04:54,612 --> 00:04:57,054
that a player undergoes is this emotional journey

69
00:04:57,634 --> 00:05:00,636
by which they achieve mastery, mastery of a situation,

70
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:02,438
of a concept, of a puzzle.

71
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:08,182
And so she called this emotion of finding mastery Sophia.

72
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,324
So an emotion of mastery.

73
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:14,067
And a lot of it's actually built on Jean Puget's

74
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:17,891
cognitive development studies from the mid 20th century.

75
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,274
So it's all about how humans find knowledge

76
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,316
and how they're engaged in finding knowledge.

77
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:29,082
So this is a chart kind of, I keep going off the mic,

78
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:30,903
this is a chart illustrating kind of

79
00:05:31,304 --> 00:05:32,784
what Hoffman calls the Sophia Loop,

80
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,406
which is this emotional journey one goes through,

81
00:05:35,446 --> 00:05:37,167
a player goes through when they're solving a puzzle,

82
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:38,407
going through a game.

83
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:40,028
So at first.

84
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:45,991
The player is confronted by fear. They have an absence of skill. They don't know what to do. They're afraid.

85
00:05:46,711 --> 00:05:50,453
And then they go through this kind of cycle of emotions.

86
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:53,854
They all fall under the general idea of surprise or being surprised.

87
00:05:55,055 --> 00:06:00,057
But you know, all things that go into speculating, being curious, discovering something, finding insight.

88
00:06:00,937 --> 00:06:05,379
And then when that all comes together and they do find that solution, they experience happiness.

89
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,960
They have a happiness of a mastery.

90
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,560
The Sophia feeling.

91
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,941
And in puzzles specifically, I like to call mastery insight,

92
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:14,282
because that's really what you're finding,

93
00:06:14,322 --> 00:06:15,924
is you're finding insight into a solution,

94
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:18,466
into how to do something.

95
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:22,682
So this loop, if you guys have played The Witness,

96
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:26,063
I think we all feel this a lot when we play The Witness.

97
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:29,025
You know, you see this like Lisa Frank nightmare,

98
00:06:29,205 --> 00:06:32,126
and you're like, what do I do about this puzzle?

99
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:33,747
I have no idea how to solve this.

100
00:06:35,147 --> 00:06:37,628
But then you think back to the puzzles that you learn,

101
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,009
and you're like, okay, well I know I need to go

102
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:41,950
from A to B, I know how to solve this puzzle.

103
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:45,552
So you go through this kind of cycle of surprise,

104
00:06:45,592 --> 00:06:48,133
of discovery, and then come out victorious.

105
00:06:50,337 --> 00:06:56,158
Another example I'll walk through because I don't want to spoil the witness is this is the flinging puzzle from Portal 1.

106
00:06:57,438 --> 00:07:02,199
So this puzzle comes in about midway through Act 1 of Portal, about like level 10.

107
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:09,481
And throughout the beginning of Portal, you've been crossing gaps kind of simply just by putting a portal next to you and hopping through it.

108
00:07:09,701 --> 00:07:13,022
And you have an easy time getting across that gap that you couldn't before.

109
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:19,763
But then you come to this place and what happens is you look around and you see your gap.

110
00:07:20,724 --> 00:07:25,567
But then you don't have anywhere to put your portals around. You can't cross that gap the way you've been crossing gaps

111
00:07:26,348 --> 00:07:31,812
for the first 10 levels of this game. So you feel fear. How do I get across here? A gun doesn't work.

112
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:35,075
But you have the knowledge of the game, so

113
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,317
you can kind of say, okay, well, I know

114
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:44,222
orange portals are usually by the goal, so this orange puzzle might be near the goal.

115
00:07:45,182 --> 00:07:47,263
And then you look below you in the pit,

116
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:48,763
in the pit you're trying to cross,

117
00:07:48,963 --> 00:07:51,183
and you're like, well, I can put a portal on that.

118
00:07:51,523 --> 00:07:51,963
That's cool.

119
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:55,364
And then you realize, oh, the exit's there.

120
00:07:55,644 --> 00:07:56,544
That's how I get across.

121
00:07:57,024 --> 00:07:59,525
And so you have this moment of surprise,

122
00:07:59,565 --> 00:08:01,425
and then this kind of happiness that you discovered,

123
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:03,505
oh, I know exactly how to cross this gap.

124
00:08:04,165 --> 00:08:05,906
I know why that portal was where it is.

125
00:08:06,346 --> 00:08:07,026
I know what to do.

126
00:08:07,046 --> 00:08:11,447
So now let's start digging into puzzles

127
00:08:11,487 --> 00:08:12,647
and talking about what they're made of.

128
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:13,847
So the elements of a puzzle.

129
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:22,563
So at the core of puzzles, you're always basically finding a key that goes into a lock.

130
00:08:23,343 --> 00:08:27,246
And sometimes the puzzle is finding the key, sometimes it's finding the lock, sometimes

131
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:28,066
a combination of both.

132
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,465
Like any game, puzzles are this creative combination of mechanics and theme.

133
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:44,694
In puzzles, I like to break mechanics out into verbs, so specifically mechanics that the player can use, things that the player can do in their level.

134
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:52,186
So, on the theme side, we have narrative and presentation, which kind of go hand in hand.

135
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:57,229
But they both contribute to giving the player a context for the world and a context for

136
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:59,191
your puzzles and what they can do in it.

137
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:04,134
A strong narrative in a puzzle gives a player a scaffold into which they can kind of find

138
00:09:04,174 --> 00:09:08,056
relationships between different things, different information that they've learned, things in

139
00:09:08,076 --> 00:09:08,837
the world that they see.

140
00:09:09,437 --> 00:09:10,738
And it disguises the design.

141
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:12,519
You're not throwing a Rubik's Cube in their face

142
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:13,760
and saying, solve it.

143
00:09:14,201 --> 00:09:15,542
You're disguising it in some way.

144
00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:19,224
It turns pressing some buttons, Simon Says style,

145
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:21,586
into a thing I did in the game,

146
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:24,388
a story I can tell about what I achieved while I was playing.

147
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,922
So I want to focus on verbs.

148
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:31,785
I thought long and hard, because in level design,

149
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:34,868
you kind of have these two camps of types of player verbs.

150
00:09:34,888 --> 00:09:37,131
So I wanted to find those and talk about how they differ.

151
00:09:38,432 --> 00:09:41,375
So I have two games up here, Legend of Zelda Wind Waker

152
00:09:41,795 --> 00:09:44,418
and Sam and Max Hit the Road, which

153
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:45,499
are two very different games.

154
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,864
I had a hard time defining these verbs, but I kind of landed on homogeneous verbs, systems-based

155
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:57,248
verbs, and then heterogeneous verbs, context-based verbs.

156
00:09:59,292 --> 00:10:06,158
So you have homogenous verbs with this grounding and systemic actions that the player does just while playing the game.

157
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,365
When you're using a homogenous game verb, the action has a very specific outcome that the player can anticipate will happen.

158
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:18,870
The meat of that puzzle is figuring out how to apply the verb's specific problems, either alone or in combination.

159
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,652
So here we have the grappling hook from Wind Waker.

160
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:25,315
You can always target a horizontal pole, like the one up there.

161
00:10:26,136 --> 00:10:32,564
and it will have link shoot a grappling hook and create a rope bridge or a rope swing rather

162
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:33,866
to swing across gaps.

163
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:37,867
And then that gets expanded upon.

164
00:10:39,447 --> 00:10:43,569
You later see additional horizontal pulls.

165
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,611
And while they still, you can still count on them

166
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:49,452
to create rope swings, they also might do things

167
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:50,433
like pull switches.

168
00:10:51,093 --> 00:10:53,534
The rope swings might be in large,

169
00:10:53,614 --> 00:10:54,915
they might create larger gaps.

170
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:57,696
There might be more challenging things around them.

171
00:10:57,716 --> 00:10:59,077
But the player can always count on,

172
00:10:59,477 --> 00:10:59,978
if I target.

173
00:11:00,558 --> 00:11:05,320
a horizontal pole with my grappling hook, I'm probably going to create a rope and I'm

174
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,841
probably going to be able to swing across some kind of gap in some way.

175
00:11:10,142 --> 00:11:16,165
And then with heterogeneous verbs, this mostly applies to your classic adventure game. The

176
00:11:16,205 --> 00:11:22,047
player's verbs are usually examine, get more information on a thing, or use a thing on

177
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:28,170
another thing. So in this example we have Sam and Max and

178
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,311
Max is the rabbit, if anyone doesn't know that.

179
00:11:32,472 --> 00:11:34,172
So the player plays as Sam.

180
00:11:35,093 --> 00:11:39,154
And in Sam and Max, in general, Max likes violence.

181
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:41,155
Max likes to do bad things.

182
00:11:41,195 --> 00:11:42,415
He likes to do violent things.

183
00:11:43,616 --> 00:11:46,577
So if the player needs to do something violent, they know

184
00:11:46,617 --> 00:11:48,257
they can use Max on that thing.

185
00:11:48,437 --> 00:11:52,619
So in our top puzzle, there's a cat here who has a piece of

186
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:53,299
paper you need.

187
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:56,600
And you use Max on the cat to pull the

188
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,521
paper out of his stomach.

189
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:03,482
And then on this bottom puzzle, there's this tunnel of love that you're trying to stop

190
00:12:04,162 --> 00:12:06,163
so that you can get out and kind of go in the secret door.

191
00:12:07,423 --> 00:12:13,285
So once you find the fuse box with the flashlight, you can take Max and use him on the fuse box.

192
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:17,046
And Sam actually dunks him in the water and uses him to short out the fuse box.

193
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:23,574
So those are two really different things. Using max isn't really predictable. You have a theme.

194
00:12:23,674 --> 00:12:30,278
Your theme is telling you, oh, thematically I use max. He's going to do something violent. But it's

195
00:12:30,338 --> 00:12:34,060
not something systemic that I can count on. It's always very special case, very

196
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:37,424
per situation and that gives it a lot of flexibility.

197
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:40,228
Sam and Max is based on this comic book,

198
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:41,930
so when you play the Sam and Max games,

199
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,732
you feel like you're just playing the comic book.

200
00:12:44,073 --> 00:12:46,275
Dunking Max in the water and shorting out a circuit

201
00:12:46,556 --> 00:12:49,519
is a story beat, you know, it's something they can do.

202
00:12:51,982 --> 00:12:54,724
But yeah, the importance, you know, not either verb you have,

203
00:12:54,804 --> 00:12:57,467
whatever type of verb you have, it's that consistency that's

204
00:12:57,507 --> 00:12:58,007
important.

205
00:12:59,008 --> 00:13:00,290
But whether it comes from systems

206
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,391
or whether it comes from narrative,

207
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:06,976
just keeping a consistent world for your player,

208
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:08,698
something that they can hook onto so

209
00:13:08,718 --> 00:13:11,861
they understand how your world works is what's important.

210
00:13:13,823 --> 00:13:16,805
Now I want to dive into difficulty.

211
00:13:17,705 --> 00:13:22,068
So difficulty is kind of the secret element of puzzles.

212
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:25,751
And it's kind of that special sauce that really gets us that

213
00:13:25,831 --> 00:13:29,434
feeling of the player feeling trusted by the designer, but

214
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:31,255
then also being challenged by the designer.

215
00:13:33,196 --> 00:13:35,058
So to get to the appropriate challenge you want to give the

216
00:13:35,118 --> 00:13:37,900
player, we should understand the elements of your puzzle

217
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,262
that can be manipulated to make the puzzle's difficulty

218
00:13:41,302 --> 00:13:42,263
level appropriate to them.

219
00:13:44,144 --> 00:13:46,106
It's the absolute hardest thing to get right in puzzles.

220
00:13:47,207 --> 00:13:47,787
Hands down.

221
00:13:48,108 --> 00:13:50,850
Getting that balance is always difficult.

222
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,234
And we'll go into that a little bit later in the talk when we start more about building

223
00:13:55,254 --> 00:13:56,254
and troubleshooting puzzles.

224
00:13:57,956 --> 00:13:58,536
And one more thing.

225
00:13:58,556 --> 00:14:00,078
I'm going to illustrate.

226
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:01,999
I have three steps for difficulty I want to talk about.

227
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:04,802
They're witness spoilers.

228
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:07,564
So if you haven't played the witness or don't want to be spoiled, turn around.

229
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:15,720
So, the first aspect of a puzzle that you can tweak to make a puzzle easier or harder

230
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,842
is how many steps it takes to solve the puzzle.

231
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:24,169
Or in games where the puzzle's state of being solved isn't super explicit, it's the amount

232
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:29,294
of steps and amount of time that passes before the player receives feedback, either positive

233
00:14:29,334 --> 00:14:31,176
or negative, about how they've interacted with the puzzle.

234
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:37,991
So the tutorial pains in the witness are a great example of this. They feel they feel much easier because

235
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,713
You're being guided through each step of a puzzle

236
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:48,597
You're getting feedback every time you learn even a nuanced new concept of the puzzle that you're trying to solve and they get progressively

237
00:14:48,657 --> 00:14:50,758
harder because they add complications

238
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:55,321
But they aren't overwhelming because you've been led into them very gradually

239
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:57,302
in succession

240
00:14:58,242 --> 00:15:00,764
And then you have something else this puzzle on the top

241
00:15:01,686 --> 00:15:05,589
you know, it's kind of a clue, but you have no immediate application to it.

242
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:09,372
You don't really, you can't look around and understand what this clue means.

243
00:15:09,752 --> 00:15:12,535
So inherently that puzzle is going to be a little harder for the player,

244
00:15:12,635 --> 00:15:15,517
because, you know, even though the solution is very explicit,

245
00:15:15,777 --> 00:15:17,659
you know, it's very obviously a puzzle that you're solving,

246
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,661
the player still has to kind of keep that in their mind,

247
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:22,523
they have to travel to that destination,

248
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:25,365
they have to find where it's applied to,

249
00:15:25,665 --> 00:15:27,727
and then know that the solution they have is in their brain

250
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:28,808
and they can apply it to that.

251
00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:34,071
that gap of time, those different steps really add to the difficulty of a puzzle.

252
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:40,616
So the next kind of dial you have for puzzle difficulty is revealing new mechanics or

253
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:46,559
revealing new information. So the first panel here on the left, that's the first puzzle,

254
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,443
The Witness. All it's teaching you is you can draw something from the start

255
00:15:52,023 --> 00:15:53,784
and to the end, and that's all it's teaching you.

256
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:56,905
And the middle puzzle complicates it a little bit.

257
00:15:56,925 --> 00:15:59,386
It says, hey, you can make wrong turns sometimes.

258
00:15:59,706 --> 00:16:01,966
If you go to a dead end, you haven't completed the puzzle.

259
00:16:02,646 --> 00:16:05,687
It also teaches you things like you can't loop around.

260
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:07,947
The path cannot touch itself.

261
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:11,288
And then the last puzzle takes all of that

262
00:16:12,628 --> 00:16:14,388
and applies it to another mechanic.

263
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:17,089
It adds a new mechanic of these colored dots.

264
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:18,969
And the player has to discover how

265
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:21,590
to deal with those different dots and learn what they mean.

266
00:16:24,263 --> 00:16:25,804
And then our third dial is kind of related.

267
00:16:26,464 --> 00:16:29,566
It's new applications of those mechanics or information.

268
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:33,889
So same mechanics, same info, but you're kind of applying it

269
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,550
in a different way or finding it in a different way

270
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,251
than you're used to.

271
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:38,032
So in this example.

272
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:44,504
Up till now, most of the puzzles that you've been solving have been, the solutions have been on the panels themselves.

273
00:16:45,105 --> 00:16:49,509
But in this example, the solution to the panel is not on the panel, it's above you.

274
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:52,792
So you have to kind of, the player has to make a mental leap to go,

275
00:16:53,132 --> 00:16:57,516
oh I need to find information outside of this panel and look at this tree,

276
00:16:57,536 --> 00:17:00,138
and make that connection and understand,

277
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:04,282
okay, I can now get information about panels from outside.

278
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:10,145
So we have, oh, so witness spoilers are done if anyone was hiding.

279
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:16,950
So our difficulty dials, steps to solve, new mechanics information, new applications of

280
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,872
mechanics, that's half of the puzzle.

281
00:17:20,852 --> 00:17:22,654
Well, the puzzle, no pun intended.

282
00:17:24,895 --> 00:17:28,878
So you're not going to find the appropriate level of difficulty just using these.

283
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:31,520
You can't do that in a vacuum.

284
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,422
You have two forces acting on your designs that are going to influence the difficulty

285
00:17:35,482 --> 00:17:35,823
as well.

286
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:38,658
difficulty considerations.

287
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,640
So you have your intended audience who's playing your game and

288
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,441
where your puzzle is in your game, in your level, in your game.

289
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:50,943
You need to consider where the puzzle is going to be experienced and how.

290
00:17:53,277 --> 00:17:56,218
When it comes to your audience, you're always really asking yourself,

291
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,760
why am I making this game and why are there puzzles in this game?

292
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,040
You might be making a more narrative-focused game,

293
00:18:02,961 --> 00:18:06,182
and you don't want the puzzles to be too hard, you don't want the player stuck,

294
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:10,504
you don't want... and you want many players to be able to play this game and be very...

295
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:12,784
you want the game to be very accessible to them.

296
00:18:13,045 --> 00:18:15,505
So you might have a difficulty that's a little lower

297
00:18:15,986 --> 00:18:17,886
than you might want, or think that you would.

298
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,408
And then, but if then your game is more challenge focused, if your game, if the point of your

299
00:18:22,428 --> 00:18:27,170
game is to challenge, if it is to do gameplay, if it's for an audience that you know wants

300
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,752
that challenge, wants to solve puzzles, then yeah, your difficulty is going to go a little

301
00:18:30,772 --> 00:18:31,152
bit higher.

302
00:18:31,172 --> 00:18:37,395
And then for progression, we're going to break out into rational puzzle design.

303
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:45,467
And what rational puzzle design, or well, rational design in general, is introducing

304
00:18:45,527 --> 00:18:49,953
concepts in an orderly fashion and preserving your macro flow.

305
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:51,575
What does that mean?

306
00:18:52,076 --> 00:18:54,358
Macro flow sounds like a rap name.

307
00:18:56,289 --> 00:19:00,352
And what that means really is just looking at your game from top to bottom.

308
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:04,034
It means understanding everything that you're making for your game.

309
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:05,535
Where does it go in your game?

310
00:19:05,596 --> 00:19:07,777
And when does the player experience it?

311
00:19:07,837 --> 00:19:09,238
Or when can they experience it?

312
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:11,020
So it's really taking your game.

313
00:19:12,989 --> 00:19:16,534
breaking it out into a piece of your game, finding the level it's in,

314
00:19:16,894 --> 00:19:21,020
then finding your puzzle. This is our portal puzzle. We know it's in

315
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:24,345
the game of Portal, it's in Act 1, it's midway through Act 1,

316
00:19:25,026 --> 00:19:28,451
it's midway through the level, and here's the steps to do the puzzle.

317
00:19:30,457 --> 00:19:33,178
So I'm going to do a pretty deep dive onto,

318
00:19:34,379 --> 00:19:36,540
with using the portal puzzle as a case study,

319
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,841
just kind of go into a deep dive of how

320
00:19:39,841 --> 00:19:42,662
you can kind of break a puzzle, or find a puzzle,

321
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:44,343
where a puzzle lives in your rational level design

322
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,564
and apply difficulty to that.

323
00:19:46,804 --> 00:19:48,025
This can be applied to any game.

324
00:19:48,845 --> 00:19:50,166
Starting from your story,

325
00:19:50,226 --> 00:19:52,767
starting from your big picture view of your game

326
00:19:52,927 --> 00:19:55,388
is usually the best way to make puzzles

327
00:19:55,448 --> 00:19:57,289
or find how to build your puzzle.

328
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:03,473
and it always gives you a roadmap. You'll always be able to go back to this flow and remember

329
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:07,316
why is this puzzle here again? What is it achieving? What is it teaching?

330
00:20:07,797 --> 00:20:12,100
So this this roadmap is a really great thing to think about. So start with your story.

331
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:16,483
I know these are narrative beats. They're not gameplay beats. These are narrative beats. It's

332
00:20:17,444 --> 00:20:18,645
Chell performing tests.

333
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:22,749
Chell escaping the facility, Chell fighting GLaDOS.

334
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,313
And we've applied it to kind of our Freytag pyramid,

335
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,836
which isn't the perfect narrative structure,

336
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:32,021
but it works to show kind of that increase in action

337
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:33,523
and that increase in tension.

338
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:38,570
So we can kind of turn that into acts.

339
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,214
We have our three acts of what our game, our gameplay kind of falls onto.

340
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,676
And we can map difficulty on that.

341
00:20:44,696 --> 00:20:48,480
You know, you expect when you're exposing things, when you're starting the game off,

342
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,885
it's going to be easier, a little bit medium difficulty, and difficulty goes up from there.

343
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,701
and then we have our levels. Now, of course, Portal knows how

344
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:01,802
many levels it has because it's a game that came out. But as you

345
00:21:01,822 --> 00:21:03,862
develop a game, you're going to be able to kind of figure out

346
00:21:04,522 --> 00:21:07,663
how much you need, how many levels you need or how many

347
00:21:07,723 --> 00:21:11,424
pieces you need to get the player up to speed with where

348
00:21:11,444 --> 00:21:14,005
they have to be. Like, obviously at the end of Act 1, the player

349
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,945
is pretty competent at using the Portal gun. They know how to do

350
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:22,086
it. They can think with portals. So it takes 20 test chambers to

351
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:25,027
do that in this game. You know, your game might be different.

352
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,545
But it's good to kind of map, like, OK, how long am I taking

353
00:21:29,605 --> 00:21:29,806
on that?

354
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:38,196
So now we can kind of see, this is a breakout of all those levels I just showed, but this

355
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:41,217
is them on a graph organized by steps to complete.

356
00:21:41,297 --> 00:21:44,739
And remember, steps to complete is one of our difficulty dials.

357
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,262
So although there's a ton of levels in Act 1, note how small they are.

358
00:21:50,282 --> 00:21:51,883
Note how few steps they take.

359
00:21:52,263 --> 00:21:56,506
And that's because they're just kind of trying to get them out and teach concepts quickly

360
00:21:56,586 --> 00:21:57,126
and cleanly.

361
00:21:58,367 --> 00:22:01,447
They're not difficult puzzles. They're really there to help teach the player,

362
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:04,588
this is how you shoot a gun. This is how you walk through a portal.

363
00:22:04,868 --> 00:22:07,309
This is where a portal goes when you shoot a gun.

364
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,691
And if you see, it kind of has the same shape as our Free Talk Pyramid.

365
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:17,972
It kind of has that gradual rise, a slight decline.

366
00:22:20,197 --> 00:22:23,739
And on a more detailed level, you see this pattern repeated.

367
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:26,760
You see a lot of crests that suddenly drop,

368
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,642
and then gradual crests that suddenly drop

369
00:22:29,802 --> 00:22:30,502
over and over again.

370
00:22:30,522 --> 00:22:35,005
And this is kind of, these dips are usually employed

371
00:22:35,365 --> 00:22:38,467
after a long or a particularly difficult puzzle.

372
00:22:39,247 --> 00:22:42,349
And again, this is only steps, so there are levels in here.

373
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:44,450
There were a lot of new concepts are being taught as well,

374
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,230
adding difficulty.

375
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:45,290
So.

376
00:22:47,452 --> 00:22:54,039
these, what I like to call breather puzzles, these kind of dips, are there more to kind of bolster the

377
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,826
player's confidence, really show them like, hey, you solved that thing, you did it, you found

378
00:22:59,926 --> 00:23:03,771
insight you need to beat a thing, and then really just like reinforcing that. Usually it's a

379
00:23:03,831 --> 00:23:08,296
repetition of beats or just a simpler version of something they've done already.

380
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:13,720
So back to our story progression graph.

381
00:23:15,281 --> 00:23:19,124
Let's dig into those new mechanics and new application dials just for a second.

382
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:25,309
So again at the end of Act 1 you have a pretty comprehensive understanding of how to use

383
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:25,649
portals.

384
00:23:28,372 --> 00:23:33,015
And we can see that, you know, flinging is a pretty advanced technique.

385
00:23:33,035 --> 00:23:37,038
I think that's the first time in portal a lot of people go, whoa, now I'm thinking with

386
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:37,459
portals.

387
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:39,681
So there's...

388
00:23:41,325 --> 00:23:42,865
A lot of concepts that have to go into that.

389
00:23:45,186 --> 00:23:50,648
Specifically, firing a blue portal and understanding that you can't fire portals into walls.

390
00:23:50,688 --> 00:23:53,729
Remember, those are both elements of that puzzle that we explored.

391
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:59,331
So those concepts are taught much earlier than Chamber 10.

392
00:24:00,112 --> 00:24:02,913
Chamber 2 and 7 respectively teach those mechanics.

393
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:07,454
And they don't just teach them like right before our puzzle,

394
00:24:07,494 --> 00:24:09,755
our really complicated, we're going to teach you how to use

395
00:24:09,795 --> 00:24:12,275
momentum puzzle, they teach them very early and they let the

396
00:24:12,315 --> 00:24:14,376
player get really used to them. So they almost take them for

397
00:24:14,416 --> 00:24:17,897
granted by the time that they get to this new challenge of

398
00:24:18,277 --> 00:24:25,119
fleeing themselves across a gap. So the flinging puzzle from the

399
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:27,520
beginning of the talk is actually the second of three. It

400
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,941
kind of sits, it's nestled in the middle of chamber 10.

401
00:24:33,727 --> 00:24:38,271
So the first puzzle that's in that chamber is actually a simple puzzle.

402
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,854
You can't get to the door because the floor is too high.

403
00:24:42,395 --> 00:24:45,157
So you solve it like you've been solving every other puzzle

404
00:24:45,297 --> 00:24:48,400
in the earlier part of Portal, which is firing a blue portal

405
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,761
and going through it.

406
00:24:50,301 --> 00:24:50,521
Easy.

407
00:24:51,835 --> 00:24:54,198
And then of course you do our flinging puzzle where you learn how to fling.

408
00:24:54,918 --> 00:24:56,319
And then you get this third puzzle,

409
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,244
which is much harder, or it appears much harder. You see the gap, the gap is

410
00:25:01,304 --> 00:25:01,785
larger.

411
00:25:02,185 --> 00:25:03,846
You still can't put any portals anywhere.

412
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:10,003
And this time, your orange portal is on the floor.

413
00:25:11,004 --> 00:25:12,425
So you're actually challenged, based

414
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:15,267
on what you learned from where the portal was

415
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:17,189
placed in the previous level, you're

416
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:19,831
learning where to put your blue portal to get the same effect.

417
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:23,494
So the game gave you an example of how to do something,

418
00:25:24,214 --> 00:25:27,897
and now they're having you apply that to the level itself.

419
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:30,920
And you can get to the exit.

420
00:25:32,881 --> 00:25:33,382
So here's.

421
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,121
Here's what the puzzles look like in the context of their level with their steps.

422
00:25:39,261 --> 00:25:42,922
And again on top we have kind of where this lives in our game.

423
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:44,522
So we know exactly where this lives in our game.

424
00:25:44,602 --> 00:25:49,363
So as someone who's analyzing this puzzle, they have a really good idea of how difficult it needs to be

425
00:25:49,803 --> 00:25:50,783
and what needs to be taught there.

426
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:55,224
So here we have, you know, obviously the steps of the puzzle.

427
00:25:56,124 --> 00:26:01,585
The blue, or sorry, the purple, the purple boxes designate a step that's

428
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:06,811
new to the player. So having to find a wall

429
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:09,996
is an escalation from puzzle one.

430
00:26:10,537 --> 00:26:13,642
Placing the portal on the top rather than on the floor

431
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:16,206
is a new concept the player is learning.

432
00:26:17,547 --> 00:26:23,693
So we can see, like, even through our level, there's been these steps added, there's been

433
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:27,557
new applications of mechanics added to challenge the player more as they go through the level.

434
00:26:28,778 --> 00:26:33,043
And what's interesting about level three also is that if you notice the first three steps

435
00:26:33,103 --> 00:26:36,326
and the last three steps in puzzle three are the same, they're actually the same.

436
00:26:37,007 --> 00:26:40,568
steps. It's fall through a hole, shoot a thing on the portal, fall through a hole, shoot a thing on

437
00:26:40,588 --> 00:26:46,309
the portal. And it's not because it's boring. It's because they're teaching the player how to do what

438
00:26:46,329 --> 00:26:50,530
they did again. They're giving them confidence. It's those breather puzzles I talked about earlier.

439
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:55,532
That subsection of puzzle three is really just, hey, you figured it out. You figured out how to

440
00:26:55,572 --> 00:27:01,273
put a portal here and you got here. Now do it again. You got it. It's just bolstering confidence.

441
00:27:03,092 --> 00:27:06,515
So mapping this stuff on Portal is really easy to understand

442
00:27:06,535 --> 00:27:07,896
because Portal is very linear.

443
00:27:09,257 --> 00:27:11,659
You can kind of plan for what the player is going to do.

444
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:15,162
All players are going to have kind of the same experience

445
00:27:15,402 --> 00:27:15,963
through your game.

446
00:27:17,138 --> 00:27:20,800
But it's important to understand you can also apply this to nonlinear games like Braid.

447
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,102
And what's great about how Braid does this and The Witness does it too,

448
00:27:25,302 --> 00:27:29,124
is that the only thing that's gaining the player is their own understanding

449
00:27:29,344 --> 00:27:32,845
of a gameplay mechanic or technique, and not the game.

450
00:27:32,865 --> 00:27:35,046
The game's never telling them they can't try something.

451
00:27:35,266 --> 00:27:38,468
It's always telling them, please try this, please explore this,

452
00:27:38,928 --> 00:27:40,188
and find the solution yourself.

453
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:45,471
And they do this really well in World 2 of The Hunt.

454
00:27:46,478 --> 00:27:49,159
you kind of just jump on, you jump on enemies to kill them and

455
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:52,381
it opens the door and it's just basic platforming skills. But

456
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:57,324
then in world four, it's the same exact set up, but you have

457
00:27:57,364 --> 00:28:00,826
an added mechanic. And if you haven't quite figured out how to

458
00:28:00,906 --> 00:28:03,808
kill enemies with this mechanic added, there's like a

459
00:28:04,348 --> 00:28:07,450
and like rewinds time and brings them back if you jump on them wrong.

460
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:11,692
So if you haven't mastered that, the game says, okay, continue on.

461
00:28:11,712 --> 00:28:12,793
You can still complete the game.

462
00:28:12,813 --> 00:28:15,254
You just can't have a like full completion of the game,

463
00:28:15,274 --> 00:28:17,876
but you can still move on and continue other puzzles.

464
00:28:17,956 --> 00:28:19,456
It never says, you're stuck here.

465
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:22,978
Finish this puzzle the way your mom says to finish your broccoli.

466
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:30,069
But linear or not, it's critical to have a firm grasp on when

467
00:28:30,089 --> 00:28:34,071
that player, on what the puzzle that your player is going

468
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:36,752
to experience, finding when it's going to be encountered

469
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:39,194
or when it might be encountered, just so you can

470
00:28:39,214 --> 00:28:40,634
ensure that that challenge is correct.

471
00:28:41,835 --> 00:28:46,277
Because again, you want that thing that's challenging, but

472
00:28:46,317 --> 00:28:47,058
still solvable.

473
00:28:47,498 --> 00:28:49,319
You need arithmetic before you teach algebra.

474
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,940
You need to have a progression in what you're

475
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,740
teaching your players.

476
00:28:55,489 --> 00:28:58,770
So now we're going to go into kind of a step-by-step of building a puzzle.

477
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:04,072
So now we have our elements and we're going to apply them to building a puzzle.

478
00:29:05,873 --> 00:29:09,294
So the most important thing is knowing the player's goal, because

479
00:29:09,935 --> 00:29:12,736
if you don't know the player's goal, then they won't.

480
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:19,078
I can guarantee you. So remember that, you know, it's always about at the heart of a

481
00:29:19,118 --> 00:29:21,659
puzzle, it's getting a key into a lock. It's finding that.

482
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,464
message that. Make sure you're messaging what is your key,

483
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:30,707
what is your lock and message the steps to whatever that goal

484
00:29:30,847 --> 00:29:37,033
is. So a lot of homogenous groups that we talked about

485
00:29:37,173 --> 00:29:40,816
earlier, they'll use specific props and messages in their

486
00:29:40,836 --> 00:29:44,759
levels. They'll repeat props. You know, Zelda has the very

487
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,782
classic like broken rock that says, hey, this can be, a bomb

488
00:29:48,822 --> 00:29:50,844
can go on this. There's a lot of cracks in this rock. Blow it

489
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:50,964
up.

490
00:29:52,642 --> 00:29:54,704
So it's easy to kind of just place it on your level.

491
00:29:55,886 --> 00:29:59,049
Of course, it's important to understand what a prop does and where it goes.

492
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:05,116
There's a lot of, you know, it's easy to find a broken rock in a Zelda environment because

493
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,238
it's a fantasy environment.

494
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:07,279
You're in a lot of nature.

495
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,861
It fits really well.

496
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:09,441
So...

497
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:17,084
You'll see them get a little more creative with things that don't quite fit in nature, like the horizontal poles from the grappling hook example.

498
00:30:17,104 --> 00:30:22,486
They'll often modify that horizontal pole to look different depending on the temple you're in.

499
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:28,308
They'll consistently keep this kind of shape on there. It's like the yellow shape on the pole.

500
00:30:29,368 --> 00:30:32,792
but they'll use ways to modify that to make it fit better in the environment.

501
00:30:33,012 --> 00:30:37,917
So it's this kind of struggle to make a prop that is very clear to the player,

502
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:42,042
you understand exactly what you do when you interact with this prop,

503
00:30:42,543 --> 00:30:45,406
and also make it fit in your world because you don't want it just sticking out like a sore thumb.

504
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:51,663
And in adventure games, this is even more critical because often you are trying to build

505
00:30:51,723 --> 00:30:55,785
a world, you're trying to tell the story, and you don't want a bunch of repeated props.

506
00:30:56,105 --> 00:31:01,267
You want a bunch of repeated broken rocks just scattered around your game telling you

507
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:02,027
to solve a puzzle.

508
00:31:02,107 --> 00:31:06,669
You want a very cohesive world that looks like the world you're trying to build.

509
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:09,150
So in our Sam and Max examples.

510
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:13,693
all the things that you interact with in Sam Max are very obviously interactable.

511
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:19,678
Especially your fuse box. It has these lightning bolts coming out of it. It's bright. It just

512
00:31:19,758 --> 00:31:27,464
begs to be looked at. You also do this in cameras. And so, you can

513
00:31:28,785 --> 00:31:35,810
In Walking Dead, again, we wanted to keep the world consistent. We didn't want to just kind of have big arrows pointing at stuff to use it.

514
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:40,593
We wanted to make sure that the player was just kind of very subtly guided to things.

515
00:31:40,953 --> 00:31:45,476
So, these are a few screenshots from a puzzle in Walking Dead Episode 3.

516
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:52,681
And the story we wanted to tell was that someone is stealing drugs from your survival group.

517
00:31:53,001 --> 00:31:54,502
They've left this broken flashlight.

518
00:31:55,323 --> 00:31:56,725
please figure out how they're doing this.

519
00:31:57,085 --> 00:32:00,409
And so the narrative was, you find these broken shards,

520
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:04,133
and then around the corner, you see this X on the wall.

521
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,898
It's this signal that whoever this perpetrator is

522
00:32:07,938 --> 00:32:10,661
has been messaging to somebody that they're

523
00:32:10,701 --> 00:32:12,363
taking the things from your survival camp

524
00:32:12,583 --> 00:32:13,244
and giving them away.

525
00:32:14,865 --> 00:32:18,807
But we wanted to make sure that you saw them in that order because if you just kind of

526
00:32:18,847 --> 00:32:23,949
found the pink X without any information or context, you're probably just going to look

527
00:32:23,989 --> 00:32:30,091
at it and go, okay, well, that's weird. Neat. Okay. So we wanted to make sure it was tied

528
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:34,973
to our broken flashlight, tied to our perpetrator. So ‑‑

529
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:40,995
We made sure that you have to look at the broken glass first

530
00:32:41,055 --> 00:32:44,496
before you even see the broken X, or the chalk X rather.

531
00:32:45,116 --> 00:32:47,977
So the bottom screenshots here, they're actually the

532
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:49,597
navigation cameras we had in the level.

533
00:32:50,257 --> 00:32:53,098
And the X is on this wall, the wall that's

534
00:32:53,118 --> 00:32:54,319
the facing screen left.

535
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:57,179
So you can actually see the X. We actually hide it from the

536
00:32:57,199 --> 00:32:59,480
player completely with our cameras to make sure that

537
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,721
they're more enticed, more willing to click

538
00:33:01,801 --> 00:33:02,481
on the broken glass.

539
00:33:05,101 --> 00:33:11,685
So when they do, we actually played a cinematic and that revealed the X.

540
00:33:11,805 --> 00:33:16,747
It actually showed Lee, the main character, himself, like making a mental connection between,

541
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:21,470
okay, I just found the pieces of this flashlight, and now I'm finding this really suspicious

542
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:21,930
mark.

543
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:26,733
So it kind of preps the player with the narrative to say, hey, you should be thinking about

544
00:33:26,873 --> 00:33:28,074
these two objects together.

545
00:33:28,114 --> 00:33:30,995
These two objects you just found have a relationship.

546
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:33,997
And we build that kind of with this narrative.

547
00:33:35,892 --> 00:33:36,972
We also build up the cameras.

548
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:40,493
Every camera in that scene is moving up and to the left.

549
00:33:40,713 --> 00:33:41,414
Every single one.

550
00:33:42,194 --> 00:33:45,815
And that's because we know when you go back to navigation camera on the bottom left here,

551
00:33:47,476 --> 00:33:49,196
we want you to go there.

552
00:33:49,216 --> 00:33:53,458
Like now go into that corner, go look at that wall, and continue to move that way.

553
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:57,359
And so we're always pushing the player, hey, make a connection between these two things

554
00:33:57,399 --> 00:33:59,880
because there's a narrative there and it's part of the puzzle.

555
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:08,307
If you don't highlight what you want your player to click on,

556
00:34:08,888 --> 00:34:13,673
you get something like this, which is a very classic adventure game pitfall

557
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:15,114
called pixel hunting.

558
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:19,219
This is a puzzle in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade

559
00:34:19,319 --> 00:34:21,641
where you have to find a book on a shelf.

560
00:34:22,502 --> 00:34:26,484
and you have no clues of what that book looks like, you literally have to just click on

561
00:34:26,544 --> 00:34:29,386
the books or hover your cursor over the books until something happens.

562
00:34:30,086 --> 00:34:33,688
And at best, this is very frustrating.

563
00:34:35,509 --> 00:34:37,409
Your player is just brute force clicking around.

564
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:40,851
They're not thinking about the connections between the objects that they're looking at.

565
00:34:40,891 --> 00:34:42,872
They're just kind of clicking mindlessly.

566
00:34:44,033 --> 00:34:47,554
At worst, your player doesn't see that this is a puzzle at all and skips it.

567
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:51,317
So it's only important to message your clues, but also

568
00:34:51,377 --> 00:34:52,858
message your puzzle in general.

569
00:34:56,381 --> 00:34:58,442
So props aren't the only way, of course, to

570
00:34:59,243 --> 00:35:00,043
message your puzzles.

571
00:35:00,564 --> 00:35:03,706
And I'm going to go back to braid, because braid also uses

572
00:35:03,766 --> 00:35:04,567
patterns a lot.

573
00:35:05,588 --> 00:35:07,369
There was a pattern in the hunt example that we had

574
00:35:07,449 --> 00:35:08,670
earlier that you understand.

575
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,591
OK, I know how to solve this.

576
00:35:10,892 --> 00:35:14,614
I have a new mechanic in play now, but I still know what the

577
00:35:14,894 --> 00:35:15,815
ultimate solution is.

578
00:35:17,557 --> 00:35:18,738
to this section.

579
00:35:18,758 --> 00:35:20,920
And this is another example on braid

580
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,082
where there's two platforms kind of moving

581
00:35:23,562 --> 00:35:25,704
and there's this one piece of geometry

582
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:26,625
that's moving vertically

583
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,788
and it's stopping the horizontal platform,

584
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:31,970
but the horizontal platform's needed to get across

585
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,172
a bunch of horrible, fiery spikes.

586
00:35:35,112 --> 00:35:38,274
So in the first level, it's really just about letting that happen.

587
00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:43,598
It's about letting that platform move over that danger and using it to get across the

588
00:35:43,638 --> 00:35:43,898
gap.

589
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:52,144
But then in world, this is four or five, the ring level, suddenly the vertical platform

590
00:35:52,164 --> 00:35:53,384
is moving a lot faster.

591
00:35:53,525 --> 00:35:58,348
And so you're like, okay, I've seen this before, I understand that there's this platform has

592
00:35:58,388 --> 00:36:00,429
to go above this vertical platform.

593
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:05,219
do I do that? This one is moving much faster. Luckily you have a mechanic that slows things

594
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:10,725
down when it's near it. So the player is kind of building this relationship. They're very

595
00:36:10,765 --> 00:36:13,168
gradually building a relationship of these things together.

596
00:36:17,315 --> 00:36:24,458
I also want to talk really briefly about chunking, which is a psychological process of taking

597
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:27,860
information, chunking it, and putting it into larger units.

598
00:36:29,141 --> 00:36:33,503
Something that was a big touchstone at Telltale was we never put more than around five things

599
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,684
that were part of a puzzle on screen ever.

600
00:36:36,705 --> 00:36:39,747
And it's because humans can only hold so much information.

601
00:36:40,488 --> 00:36:43,210
We really want them to make those relationships

602
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,391
between the clues they're finding.

603
00:36:44,451 --> 00:36:46,973
So we don't want to just dump a bunch of things on them

604
00:36:47,173 --> 00:36:48,073
and have them find them.

605
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:50,475
Because that's just as bad as clicking

606
00:36:50,495 --> 00:36:51,476
a bunch of random books.

607
00:36:51,896 --> 00:36:53,518
Clicking a bunch of stuff just to click on it

608
00:36:53,598 --> 00:36:54,939
is just as mindless of a task.

609
00:36:54,999 --> 00:36:57,220
So we want players to be very thoughtful

610
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,962
and think about what is next to each other

611
00:37:00,022 --> 00:37:01,584
and what they're seeing in a sequence.

612
00:37:01,964 --> 00:37:02,945
What's grouped together.

613
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:05,186
So it's important.

614
00:37:07,963 --> 00:37:09,984
So our next big bullet point for when you build a puzzle,

615
00:37:11,304 --> 00:37:12,865
you have your goal, you've messaged your goal,

616
00:37:12,945 --> 00:37:14,225
you've created your challenge.

617
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:17,106
The next important thing is giving the player feedback.

618
00:37:18,226 --> 00:37:21,248
You need to let the player know how they're doing

619
00:37:21,328 --> 00:37:22,128
as they play your puzzle.

620
00:37:23,828 --> 00:37:26,509
And you can do that by rewarding and encouraging your player

621
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:27,550
when they're on the right track.

622
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,831
And you can also do that by communicating to the player

623
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:31,911
when they've hit a dead end.

624
00:37:32,772 --> 00:37:34,052
These are both very important things.

625
00:37:35,779 --> 00:37:43,647
So it can be really difficult for a player to know when or when not is a valid option to interact with something.

626
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:47,830
Especially in adventure games, you'll often get the, I can't use these things together.

627
00:37:48,431 --> 00:37:53,576
And it's not great. It means, okay, we didn't have the scope to give you an interaction with this.

628
00:37:53,696 --> 00:37:55,678
But it's still feedback. It's still telling you.

629
00:37:56,479 --> 00:38:00,783
hey, you're on the wrong track. You know, this is like a dart

630
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:03,586
board full of axes and knives and you're like, oh, obviously

631
00:38:03,646 --> 00:38:06,229
Max should do something with that. He's super violent. But

632
00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:11,054
it's not. So the name just says like, hey, no, sorry. But it's

633
00:38:11,074 --> 00:38:12,716
important. Otherwise the player might just kind of go down a

634
00:38:12,756 --> 00:38:15,178
rabbit hole. No pun intended.

635
00:38:18,886 --> 00:38:21,690
And then in Walking Dead, we actually solve this by kind of

636
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:24,253
actually restricting the amount of verbs a player could even

637
00:38:24,393 --> 00:38:28,719
use. You know, Lee has a whole inventory. He has, you know,

638
00:38:28,759 --> 00:38:31,062
there's two items in his inventory right now. He

639
00:38:31,102 --> 00:38:34,747
normally can look at stuff. But when he's using a zombie, he

640
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:35,508
only can shoot it.

641
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:40,769
and that makes sense because if you saw a zombie and you had a gun, that's probably what you're going to do.

642
00:38:41,909 --> 00:38:46,810
You know, it's a lot of content and a lot of time and a lot of steps that a player has to go through

643
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:51,911
to kind of look at a full verb option wheel and go, what if I look at the zombie?

644
00:38:52,771 --> 00:38:55,472
What if I use my clipboard on the zombie?

645
00:38:55,492 --> 00:39:00,033
You know, it's a lot faster and it's a lot more meaningful in the moment to just say,

646
00:39:00,553 --> 00:39:03,773
you probably want to shoot the zombie. Lee's pretty afraid right now of the zombie.

647
00:39:05,353 --> 00:39:08,776
Then when you find out the zombie is dead, we give you back your verbs like examine,

648
00:39:08,976 --> 00:39:11,178
look at, because they're relevant again.

649
00:39:11,418 --> 00:39:17,143
I've gone from action mode from I'm scared of something to okay, now it's time to figure

650
00:39:17,203 --> 00:39:17,803
out what's happening.

651
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:21,726
It's time for me to sit and think and look at the scene and understand what's happening

652
00:39:21,766 --> 00:39:21,887
here.

653
00:39:21,907 --> 00:39:29,093
Another important thing to remember when building a puzzle is to be kind.

654
00:39:29,513 --> 00:39:30,754
Just be kind to your player.

655
00:39:32,846 --> 00:39:36,332
It's a contract of challenging them, but then not making things impossible.

656
00:39:38,435 --> 00:39:39,517
Repetition isn't fun.

657
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:43,543
Making a player replay something over and over again because they failed isn't fun.

658
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:51,156
and checking your skill checks. And what I mean by that is, you know, if you have a verb-based,

659
00:39:51,196 --> 00:39:54,739
a more systemic verb-based game, you have a lot of physics in your game, the players

660
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:00,005
challenged to move through it, that's good, but make sure that those skill checks are informed.

661
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:04,309
Make sure they're not making the player repeat a lot of things. I was just talking to a friend of

662
00:40:04,349 --> 00:40:07,553
mine. There's this Forsaken Fortress in Wind Waker.

663
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:13,118
And I hated it. I stopped playing Wind Waker. I didn't play Wind Waker for a long time

664
00:40:13,658 --> 00:40:19,203
because I played this level and it has a ton of skill checks where you can fall. And when you

665
00:40:19,343 --> 00:40:25,468
fall, you have to repeat the entire level over again. And to be clear, I love Wind Waker. Zelda's

666
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:31,834
great. Thumbs up. But man, that killed it. Like, and think of how good Wind Waker is, but just

667
00:40:31,874 --> 00:40:33,775
having to repeat those puzzles over and over again.

668
00:40:34,456 --> 00:40:36,977
They're puzzles, so you have a dominant solution, you found a

669
00:40:36,997 --> 00:40:41,239
dominant strategy, you know what you're doing. If you know what

670
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:43,220
you're doing but you can't execute it, it's extremely

671
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:48,302
frustrating. And to go back to Portal again, they do a great

672
00:40:48,342 --> 00:40:52,904
job with this because whenever you fail in Portal, they either

673
00:40:53,445 --> 00:40:55,886
put you back very close to where you failed, so you're kind of

674
00:40:55,926 --> 00:40:59,727
learning, okay, this is the last place I was before I screwed

675
00:40:59,747 --> 00:41:01,648
everything up. I can now think about that.

676
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:05,612
So the deaths in Portal or the failures in Portal are also teaching the player,

677
00:41:06,073 --> 00:41:07,754
hey, you were right up to this point.

678
00:41:08,975 --> 00:41:09,996
So try again.

679
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:13,720
What you did was wrong, and now try a different solution.

680
00:41:18,385 --> 00:41:22,968
The last thing when building a puzzle is integrate your story into your puzzle.

681
00:41:22,988 --> 00:41:27,411
And that's why it's so important to have that macro chart, that progression flow of your

682
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:31,814
game, because when you have your story mapped out and you'll understand where your story

683
00:41:31,874 --> 00:41:36,257
is in your puzzle, where it is in your game, you can always go there for inspiration.

684
00:41:38,218 --> 00:41:43,359
The picture on the left here is from a game called Quadrilateral Cowboy where you're actually hacking.

685
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:48,720
And when you're hacking in Quadrilateral Cowboy, you're moving through a level.

686
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:52,501
You're actually getting like take your laptop out and hack and like open a door.

687
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:56,022
And it's very integrated in the game. It's a part of the story.

688
00:41:56,102 --> 00:41:59,263
You feel like you're this secret agent hacker who's opening things.

689
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:01,964
Whereas in Bioshock, you're just playing Pipe Dream.

690
00:42:03,624 --> 00:42:05,904
If you played Bioshock, it's not about playing Pipe Dream.

691
00:42:07,105 --> 00:42:12,247
So the hacking puzzles in that game are a lot weaker because they're not integrated in the story.

692
00:42:12,267 --> 00:42:15,148
There's kind of this weird mini-game that happens.

693
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:18,169
So always look at your story.

694
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:20,670
And then remember the golden rule.

695
00:42:21,971 --> 00:42:23,071
Always be kind to your players.

696
00:42:24,391 --> 00:42:30,954
Let them, give them a challenge, but give them the materials they need to complete that challenge.

697
00:42:32,114 --> 00:42:34,515
If you ever watch Sherlock Holmes, it always cracks me up when people...

698
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:39,259
say, oh, you can follow along Sherlock Holmes and solve the

699
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,963
crimes with him, because you can't. He has a ton of information that you don't have.

700
00:42:44,083 --> 00:42:48,206
He's just saying, well, didn't you notice that his hand has four calces on it?

701
00:42:48,226 --> 00:42:51,829
He's a tennis player and the specific shoe print we found is a

702
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,433
Nike tennis boot. This is information you didn't have.

703
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:59,356
And so, you know, when you make your players feel like Watson, just kind of

704
00:42:59,396 --> 00:43:01,057
staring at Sherlock, it doesn't feel good.

705
00:43:03,438 --> 00:43:06,760
So remember, puzzles are fun for the player, not the designer.

706
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,881
Don't get super excited about feeling clever.

707
00:43:08,901 --> 00:43:11,842
Just make a good experience.

708
00:43:14,683 --> 00:43:18,424
So lastly, I want to talk about troubleshooting, because as I said, you know, difficulty among

709
00:43:18,464 --> 00:43:21,405
other things, it's really difficult to get right.

710
00:43:22,706 --> 00:43:26,367
You know, even with all these tips, it's going to take a lot of iteration, a lot of considerations

711
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:29,508
to get your puzzle to feel good and do exactly what you want it to do.

712
00:43:30,952 --> 00:43:32,072
And you do that with user testing.

713
00:43:33,373 --> 00:43:34,553
And you do that as much as you can.

714
00:43:35,934 --> 00:43:38,295
Seriously, you do it as much as you can.

715
00:43:39,455 --> 00:43:41,816
There's no excuse for not getting user testing.

716
00:43:42,577 --> 00:43:44,737
It's so important to capture as much of your tester's

717
00:43:44,757 --> 00:43:47,439
thinking process as possible, because that's going to really

718
00:43:47,479 --> 00:43:50,440
tell you if your difficulty levels are appropriate or not.

719
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,104
There was a great postmortem for Myst in GDC 2013 that I definitely recommend checking

720
00:43:56,204 --> 00:44:01,808
out because Robin Miller was talking about how even before Myst was a game, even before

721
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:06,151
they were able to throw it on a hyper card stack and make it a thing, they were doing

722
00:44:06,191 --> 00:44:07,112
it D&D style.

723
00:44:07,152 --> 00:44:09,814
They would actually describe to the player, this is what you see.

724
00:44:10,975 --> 00:44:14,100
can you solve this? And as you know, Myst is very open and it

725
00:44:15,562 --> 00:44:18,947
is allowed to be that way because they did so much testing

726
00:44:18,987 --> 00:44:22,052
with here is literally as open we can get. Here is a D&D role

727
00:44:22,072 --> 00:44:23,875
playing game. Can you solve this puzzle?

728
00:44:24,965 --> 00:44:29,027
And then later in their testing process when they did have something implemented, they

729
00:44:29,467 --> 00:44:31,668
actually would always test with two people.

730
00:44:32,088 --> 00:44:33,148
They'd usually test with couples.

731
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:36,390
And that was because they liked to talk to each other.

732
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:39,631
So, you know, obviously puzzle games are very heady.

733
00:44:39,671 --> 00:44:41,411
We get in our own heads when we're solving them.

734
00:44:41,431 --> 00:44:44,793
But when we're solving with another person, we're talking a lot more about what we're

735
00:44:44,833 --> 00:44:46,413
thinking and about our thought processes.

736
00:44:47,114 --> 00:44:49,735
And it's a really great way to see what a player is thinking

737
00:44:49,795 --> 00:44:53,258
and having them argue for a solution is going to give you a

738
00:44:53,298 --> 00:44:55,479
lot more information than them just kind of staring at the

739
00:44:55,499 --> 00:44:56,380
screen and blinking a lot.

740
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:00,923
Oh, I missed that.

741
00:45:02,001 --> 00:45:04,203
Oh, but yeah, so always know where your players get stuck.

742
00:45:05,044 --> 00:45:06,126
And then, yeah, look at this.

743
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:08,629
Next is coming a self-check to examine

744
00:45:08,669 --> 00:45:09,450
why they're getting stuck.

745
00:45:10,371 --> 00:45:14,316
So if your player says, that was too easy, which is very

746
00:45:14,376 --> 00:45:15,317
rare, but you'll get it.

747
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,601
did you give them a chance to solve it themselves? Did you

748
00:45:19,641 --> 00:45:22,162
just feed them the answer? And if they think it's too easy,

749
00:45:22,562 --> 00:45:24,563
maybe you already taught that concept before. Maybe that

750
00:45:24,603 --> 00:45:27,084
mechanic was already really effectively tutorialized and

751
00:45:27,104 --> 00:45:29,805
you're kind of getting repetitious. So look back at

752
00:45:29,845 --> 00:45:31,666
your chart and say, okay, maybe I don't need as much

753
00:45:31,706 --> 00:45:33,067
tutorialization as I thought.

754
00:45:35,303 --> 00:45:37,245
They may also mean that it was just lock and key.

755
00:45:37,285 --> 00:45:38,246
It was very obvious.

756
00:45:38,306 --> 00:45:41,869
There weren't enough steps between your lock and your key

757
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:42,809
to find those things.

758
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:45,932
There weren't enough variations in your verbs and applications.

759
00:45:46,833 --> 00:45:49,435
If you guys ever played Pokemon, they have the cut mechanic.

760
00:45:50,155 --> 00:45:53,098
And at first, you're like, oh, I can't break these bushes.

761
00:45:53,138 --> 00:45:54,158
I have to cut down these bushes.

762
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:54,839
How do I do that?

763
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:57,261
You learn cut, and you can cut down bushes.

764
00:45:57,281 --> 00:45:58,722
That's all you can ever do.

765
00:45:59,142 --> 00:46:00,183
It never escalates to that.

766
00:46:00,223 --> 00:46:01,885
It's always just, there's no thinking anymore.

767
00:46:01,905 --> 00:46:02,305
It's just like, OK.

768
00:46:03,686 --> 00:46:08,148
taking my rat-a-tat and like another bush down okay it's not thinking it's just

769
00:46:08,248 --> 00:46:13,351
lock and key it never evolves past that door so too hard which is a lot more

770
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:18,914
common you'll get a lot more too hards and just ask yourself like was it did I

771
00:46:18,974 --> 00:46:22,636
give information to solve this puzzle how long ago did I give that information

772
00:46:22,676 --> 00:46:25,517
ago because it might just be not relevant to the player anymore and can

773
00:46:25,557 --> 00:46:28,599
they get back to it like is it lost forever can they reference that

774
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,279
information again

775
00:46:30,586 --> 00:46:32,407
And then of course, is the goal clear to the player?

776
00:46:32,427 --> 00:46:35,930
And this is looking at your level layout, looking at your visuals, making sure your

777
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:41,194
path is clear, all the stuff that a level designer does when just making things obvious

778
00:46:41,254 --> 00:46:41,555
goals.

779
00:46:43,498 --> 00:46:44,339
And then check your dials.

780
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:46,880
Are there too many steps in your puzzle?

781
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,600
This is very, very common.

782
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,681
I see this all the time.

783
00:46:49,701 --> 00:46:53,943
People just put too many steps in their puzzles because, again, it feels clever, or they've

784
00:46:54,483 --> 00:46:57,324
been playing their own game like a thousand times, and they're like, well, obviously,

785
00:46:57,344 --> 00:47:02,566
you know, these hundred steps, this horrible Rube Goldberg machine equates to this puzzle

786
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:03,186
being solved.

787
00:47:03,246 --> 00:47:05,968
But on first blush, a lot of players aren't going to get that.

788
00:47:06,868 --> 00:47:09,091
And again, check your mechanics, are you teaching them well?

789
00:47:10,572 --> 00:47:12,334
Are you changing the context of a mechanic?

790
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:14,176
And this is what I was talking about with consistency.

791
00:47:14,757 --> 00:47:16,840
It's great to make new applications of mechanics,

792
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,801
it's great to change them.

793
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:20,704
But if that new way is unintuitive

794
00:47:20,724 --> 00:47:22,166
or hasn't been tutorialized, the player's

795
00:47:22,186 --> 00:47:23,087
going to have a hard time with it.

796
00:47:24,668 --> 00:47:26,651
So your golden rules.

797
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:29,847
take a picture of this when it's done. It's going to come in as

798
00:47:29,887 --> 00:47:34,773
bullets. A good puzzle challenges the player without

799
00:47:34,813 --> 00:47:39,077
hand holding or being unfair. Fun for the player, not the

800
00:47:39,097 --> 00:47:40,759
designer. Don't be Sherlock Holmes.

801
00:47:42,758 --> 00:47:47,680
Puzzles combine a game's theme and mechanics and rely on the consistency of each to make sense.

802
00:47:48,181 --> 00:47:51,142
You know, consistency is your friend in puzzles.

803
00:47:52,863 --> 00:47:56,164
And look at your puzzle in the context of the game as a whole to judge its difficulty.

804
00:47:56,724 --> 00:47:58,605
It's the best way to figure out if your puzzle is doing what it needs.

805
00:47:58,645 --> 00:47:59,105
Oh, there's one more!

806
00:48:02,108 --> 00:48:05,129
Watch others play your puzzle and check for assumptions you may have made.

807
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:08,931
You know, we're all different human beings, we're all different people, we're from different cultures.

808
00:48:09,351 --> 00:48:14,113
We all think differently and that's the fun of puzzle design is you really get to watch people think

809
00:48:14,633 --> 00:48:18,275
and watch people work through problems and learn new things.

810
00:48:19,936 --> 00:48:20,976
And that's my talk.

811
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:30,942
This talk was really two hours long, so I encourage you guys to also take a picture of this slide and just check out some of these really great articles.

812
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:39,785
You know, lots of rational level design stuff, some great GDC talks from past years, all good stuff.

813
00:48:40,686 --> 00:48:43,807
And then, I think, how much time we got? We're in five?

814
00:48:45,387 --> 00:48:47,228
Yeah, I'll take like a couple questions.

815
00:48:47,728 --> 00:48:51,349
Yeah, if anyone has questions, feel free to come up to the mics over there.

816
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:55,550
And thank you, everybody.

817
00:49:06,821 --> 00:49:12,804
I'd like to hear thoughts on dynamic difficulty from the point of view of, I'm sure everybody

818
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:17,646
in this room has hit a puzzle and literally walked away from the games, and I mean I've

819
00:49:17,686 --> 00:49:21,047
done this many times, but there's kind of like two ways.

820
00:49:21,087 --> 00:49:25,950
Some games do kind of like, you know, the voice comes on and gives you a hint, but some

821
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:26,670
games do it too early.

822
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:29,111
There's ones where you're walking through and you're thinking, okay, I'm just going

823
00:49:29,131 --> 00:49:33,573
to, and they'll go, oh, look at this, and it's a bit too much of a giveaway, but I mean

824
00:49:33,593 --> 00:49:34,393
from the point of view of.

825
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:41,416
Are we able yet really to have a puzzle and you try something and it doesn't work?

826
00:49:41,797 --> 00:49:46,882
And you try something else it doesn't work and not just to give away a hint or there's the key but to

827
00:49:47,522 --> 00:49:53,809
dynamically change the puzzle because it's like you've detected that the person's tried five things and it hasn't worked and

828
00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:56,131
We we don't want them to give up. We want them to keep playing

829
00:49:56,785 --> 00:50:02,790
Yeah, so a lot of games have tried this. You know, to hint systems, I think some hint systems are

830
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:08,194
garbage. Some hint systems are just really bad because they do just tell you go, there's the

831
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:12,958
key, go do it, what are you doing, you idiot. And yeah, that's always bad because it's still that

832
00:50:13,038 --> 00:50:17,321
same problem of I'm still not letting the player solve it themselves. It's the designer kind of

833
00:50:17,361 --> 00:50:21,985
giving up on you. It's your teacher just saying just copy my answers, just go. It's that same

834
00:50:22,065 --> 00:50:22,625
feeling. So.

835
00:50:23,306 --> 00:50:25,668
I think there are good hint systems up there. Actually,

836
00:50:26,368 --> 00:50:31,011
mist had a really good hint system. Not mist, mist uru, the

837
00:50:31,031 --> 00:50:34,934
third one. It was really because they wrote them well. They were

838
00:50:34,974 --> 00:50:37,315
very careful in their language. They were careful in how they

839
00:50:37,455 --> 00:50:40,818
gave them. Eventually they got pretty on the nose. But there

840
00:50:40,858 --> 00:50:43,760
were a lot of them. Granted, that's a lot of content. But

841
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,782
there was a lot to give them. I've also seen diamond. So

842
00:50:48,783 --> 00:50:55,667
What you're describing I think of a dynamic puzzle changing. I've also seen that in Silent Hill, I think had that.

843
00:50:56,548 --> 00:51:03,512
And the problem I see with that is that you're suddenly, what Silent Hill did was they had easy, medium, hard.

844
00:51:03,552 --> 00:51:07,414
And when you played that game on those different difficulties, the puzzles actually changed.

845
00:51:07,995 --> 00:51:10,916
And they used the dials we talked about, like often the hard puzzles.

846
00:51:11,477 --> 00:51:14,160
had more steps or more connections you had to make.

847
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:16,664
But it's a lot of content because they literally

848
00:51:16,684 --> 00:51:18,486
made three puzzles for every one puzzle.

849
00:51:18,947 --> 00:51:20,949
So I think that's a big barrier,

850
00:51:20,989 --> 00:51:22,712
is just that amount of content you have to make,

851
00:51:22,732 --> 00:51:23,994
you're suddenly tripling your scope.

852
00:51:25,845 --> 00:51:35,313
Because there is, you know, puzzles are so tightly interwoven, it's tough to kind of get, it's tough to just kind of take away or put in steps to add difficulty.

853
00:51:36,814 --> 00:51:37,054
So...

854
00:51:37,374 --> 00:51:42,198
So you think it's too much of a design, it would just be too much of a challenge for the creation of the game?

855
00:51:42,398 --> 00:51:45,801
I think it's a great challenge to try. I think it's a good design challenge.

856
00:51:45,881 --> 00:51:50,345
I think the scope is where you're going to run into trouble. But, maybe I've got a ton of money.

857
00:51:50,365 --> 00:51:52,086
Thank you.

858
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,083
We have one more I think we have two minutes left in this session unless we want to break out to a panel

859
00:52:01,905 --> 00:52:05,008
Hi, I'd like to hear your thoughts on like

860
00:52:06,765 --> 00:52:12,950
How it can be hard to teach somebody something during an intense moment like how it's probably easier when they're things are very calm

861
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,812
and you have your own, but if you're like

862
00:52:15,692 --> 00:52:16,953
doing an FPS or

863
00:52:17,714 --> 00:52:20,236
More action a game like how to teach the player

864
00:52:20,917 --> 00:52:26,041
Even though he's in an intense or she is in an intense moment like if there's an action a lot of action going on

865
00:52:26,381 --> 00:52:30,984
Any advice on how to teach players to things if it's supposed to be high intensity game

866
00:52:31,084 --> 00:52:33,526
How do you teach players or have puzzles in there?

867
00:52:33,922 --> 00:52:38,684
Well, I think even in a high intensity game, you are going to have points of low intensity.

868
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:43,487
Like if your game is only high tension, it's just going to feel like you're getting hit

869
00:52:43,747 --> 00:52:45,488
all the time and you're just going to become numb.

870
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:52,393
So there is definitely finding those points of low intensity and using those just to like

871
00:52:52,413 --> 00:52:54,654
kind of bolster the player to teach them those basics.

872
00:52:55,134 --> 00:52:57,356
It's great when you can say, hey, you learned some basics.

873
00:52:58,196 --> 00:53:05,008
Now you're in a more tense moment. You're you know difficulties added through a time a timing element or something like that

874
00:53:06,551 --> 00:53:06,751
but

875
00:53:07,762 --> 00:53:11,725
Yeah, I think it's more just like making sure the player again has that tool set they need.

876
00:53:11,925 --> 00:53:13,186
They have that knowledge in there.

877
00:53:13,686 --> 00:53:16,829
And then when they're confronted with this stressful situation,

878
00:53:16,849 --> 00:53:18,570
you can ask them to do something like that.

879
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:21,992
You can ask them to test what they know or challenge themselves in some way.

880
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:25,735
But I think it's really just, that's how much more work you're going to have to do

881
00:53:25,755 --> 00:53:28,917
to really scaffold their knowledge and their skills.

882
00:53:30,558 --> 00:53:31,319
Does that answer your question?

883
00:53:31,797 --> 00:53:35,419
So you generally just try to avoid teaching players too much

884
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:37,199
new stuff during the tough moments,

885
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:38,680
and then just have them apply that knowledge

886
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,540
in a different way, rather.

887
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:40,420
Yeah, I think so.

888
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:43,722
Because your action, that's a new setting.

889
00:53:43,742 --> 00:53:45,622
I suddenly have a lot more things to think about.

890
00:53:46,023 --> 00:53:48,263
So that's all new information, new stuff

891
00:53:48,804 --> 00:53:49,924
that's adding to the difficulty.

892
00:53:49,984 --> 00:53:51,865
So there's not really much more you need to do from there.

893
00:53:51,965 --> 00:53:53,365
You're already giving them something

894
00:53:53,385 --> 00:53:54,266
stressful to deal with.

895
00:53:54,286 --> 00:53:56,246
OK, thanks.
