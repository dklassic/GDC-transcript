1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,021
Hi, I'm Lisa Brunette and I'm the owner of Brunette Games.

2
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:11,522
This is Anthony and Dexter.

3
00:00:11,602 --> 00:00:13,743
They also work for Brunette Games.

4
00:00:14,544 --> 00:00:17,705
Originally, this was supposed to be a preview of my talk

5
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:21,907
for the Game Developers Conference in a couple of weeks.

6
00:00:21,967 --> 00:00:23,828
You may know that it was canceled

7
00:00:24,168 --> 00:00:25,429
because of the coronavirus.

8
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:27,069
It's in San Francisco every year.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:32,432
So it's no longer a preview for me to deliver a talk.

10
00:00:32,572 --> 00:00:33,072
And since...

11
00:00:33,747 --> 00:00:38,768
I've been working, especially over the last year, to develop this team of great, awesome people.

12
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:43,929
In that spirit, I invited them to come in and join the talk with me,

13
00:00:44,349 --> 00:00:48,851
especially since the games that we are going to showcase tonight,

14
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:52,552
they're the ones who know more about them than I do at this point,

15
00:00:53,092 --> 00:00:57,033
which is the very definition of growing your team, right?

16
00:00:57,653 --> 00:00:59,173
So I'm really excited to have them.

17
00:01:01,342 --> 00:01:03,263
We're gonna talk about three things

18
00:01:03,383 --> 00:01:07,405
that we discuss with our clients absolutely every day.

19
00:01:07,945 --> 00:01:09,486
Conflict, mystery, and connection.

20
00:01:09,966 --> 00:01:12,728
We work mainly on casual three-play puzzle games,

21
00:01:12,808 --> 00:01:14,308
although that's starting to change

22
00:01:14,348 --> 00:01:15,989
as we branch out to other areas.

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,491
So a little bit about us.

24
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:21,852
We're a storytelling-focused studio.

25
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:23,173
So we're primarily writers.

26
00:01:23,513 --> 00:01:25,194
We do something called narrative design,

27
00:01:25,214 --> 00:01:28,476
which is the design of story in games.

28
00:01:28,949 --> 00:01:31,470
which gets to be a fairly technical skill

29
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,610
because you have the gameplay and the story

30
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,791
that need to be integrated and working together.

31
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:39,832
So that's a focus, and yes, we do have shirts,

32
00:01:40,172 --> 00:01:41,013
matching shirts.

33
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:44,314
We didn't wear them because they're in their short sleeve,

34
00:01:44,914 --> 00:01:45,994
they're in the summer box.

35
00:01:46,794 --> 00:01:49,415
But this is the group that needs to dress alike.

36
00:01:49,975 --> 00:01:51,096
And we have that group.

37
00:01:52,256 --> 00:01:54,256
So these are our services.

38
00:01:54,337 --> 00:01:56,037
Narrative design and story concepts.

39
00:01:56,637 --> 00:01:58,538
Dialogue scripts and in-game text.

40
00:01:59,705 --> 00:02:02,566
storyboard cut scenes and voiceover recordings,

41
00:02:04,706 --> 00:02:07,487
task and quest flows, branching dialogue

42
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:08,728
and choice stats as well.

43
00:02:09,208 --> 00:02:13,409
So even though Anthony has a fantastic voice,

44
00:02:13,529 --> 00:02:16,430
we are actually not the voice over actors.

45
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:19,091
In addition to this crew full-time,

46
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:21,932
we have four other people, two part-time writers

47
00:02:21,972 --> 00:02:24,533
we just hired from St. Louis University here locally

48
00:02:24,553 --> 00:02:26,934
in the English department, yay, where I graduated.

49
00:02:27,908 --> 00:02:33,452
and two voiceover actors who work out of their home studios on the east and west coast for us.

50
00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:40,378
One of whom is someone who was born and raised in St. Louis and just went out to LA and is becoming a famous actress.

51
00:02:41,018 --> 00:02:42,119
Pretty neat story, I think.

52
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,041
The first thing we're going to talk about is conflict.

53
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:47,963
How many of you think conflict, bad word?

54
00:02:49,384 --> 00:02:50,886
Good! You've been trained well.

55
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:56,950
You're ahead of our developers who shy away from this constantly.

56
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,962
Just today, in fact, we were working with an IP

57
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:04,925
that will not be mentioned, but is very well known.

58
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:08,788
And we had to kind of school them on this idea of,

59
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:12,191
you know, if you want story, that thing should happen.

60
00:03:13,912 --> 00:03:17,615
This is Matchington Mansion, which is kind of our free bird.

61
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:21,598
It's what everyone wants when they come to us for services.

62
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,240
It made $11 million in revenue in January alone.

63
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:32,841
In the very beginning of this game, you have your bestie, Tiffany, who comes up and she's

64
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:35,702
encouraging you because all this door needs is a little bit of paint.

65
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:39,924
So this is a restoration game where you're going to fix up a mansion.

66
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:44,846
The first thing that happens is that door falls down.

67
00:03:45,346 --> 00:03:47,607
So that's your little first bit of conflict.

68
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:50,549
It's not heavy conflict, but it's enough.

69
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:55,831
It makes it exciting for you, actually, because you were drawn to this game to fix up that

70
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:56,151
mansion.

71
00:03:57,577 --> 00:04:00,137
You know, we're gamers, we like problems.

72
00:04:00,237 --> 00:04:02,658
This is the developer presenting this,

73
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:07,440
look, here's a problem, it's a gift to you, now solve it.

74
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,141
The next thing we do is have a bad guy show up.

75
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:13,582
I know this seems like storytelling 101,

76
00:04:13,702 --> 00:04:16,223
but a lot of developers don't have any bad guys

77
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:17,483
in their character set.

78
00:04:21,425 --> 00:04:25,346
So when Tiffany fights back, conflict,

79
00:04:29,165 --> 00:04:30,645
and his name is Rex Houston, of course.

80
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:34,547
And the fact that he has a claim on the mansion

81
00:04:34,587 --> 00:04:36,968
because he was related to the person who gave it to you

82
00:04:37,468 --> 00:04:40,210
threatens the very reason you were brought to this game,

83
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,291
right, to fix up that mansion.

84
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:45,192
So it's a little more than making the place pretty.

85
00:04:46,172 --> 00:04:48,814
You are there to keep it from Rex

86
00:04:49,594 --> 00:04:51,635
and keep it from being turned into a casino.

87
00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:54,036
So it just gives you a little more motivation.

88
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:57,878
These are the hooks that draw the player into the game.

89
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:05,764
It also provides us a way to give a seamless name integration, which can be a little bit awkward in these mobile games.

90
00:05:06,644 --> 00:05:14,869
So we've got this, and I usually use Dinglebutt, but I thought for this talk I would do something safer.

91
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:22,673
Now you don't always have to have, and we'll admit, this guy, mustache twitching villain, right?

92
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:27,776
A little obvious, but sometimes those obvious tropes, especially when you're doing something new, this game came out

93
00:05:28,368 --> 00:05:32,790
three and a half years ago and in its genre it had no one had done it.

94
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:37,453
So we needed something a little obvious to kind of school those players into

95
00:05:37,993 --> 00:05:43,135
you have a match theory game but you also have a story. Here's a villain. You know how this works.

96
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:50,018
And I'll admit that I'm influenced with boss horror.

97
00:05:50,098 --> 00:05:54,660
So you don't have to have that though. Sometimes the bad guy isn't all bad.

98
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:57,581
And so we went a little further with the game Lily's Garden.

99
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,541
which in terms of revenue is just under matching to matching.

100
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:03,702
It came out in the spring of 2019

101
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:08,764
and it is making about $8 million in revenue.

102
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:11,625
And all of this is on the Censor Tower

103
00:06:11,665 --> 00:06:14,226
so it's not like secret information.

104
00:06:14,486 --> 00:06:17,388
This guy, Philip Jones, is not the most,

105
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:19,789
he actually has a mustache but he's not twitching it.

106
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:23,410
He's not so much of a, he is here to explain

107
00:06:23,871 --> 00:06:24,631
that there's a little.

108
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:36,834
a special condition.

109
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:43,438
So you have to restore the entire garden to its former glory in 30 days.

110
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:51,784
And this is the way that a character who never appears on screen, she's a great aunt, reaches

111
00:06:52,305 --> 00:06:53,105
from the grave.

112
00:06:57,322 --> 00:06:58,562
you have to do the impossible.

113
00:06:58,642 --> 00:07:00,323
So when this pans back and you see

114
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:02,304
the whole disheveled garden area,

115
00:07:02,324 --> 00:07:03,944
you see that's a pretty tall order.

116
00:07:04,845 --> 00:07:06,365
And of course there are other obstacles

117
00:07:06,445 --> 00:07:09,446
that come across too.

118
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:12,107
So this guy is an interesting character

119
00:07:12,207 --> 00:07:15,669
in that he's not gonna sabotage you or anything like that.

120
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:17,910
He isn't really on your side though.

121
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,330
He means business.

122
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:29,733
Another way that we deal with villains, I'm going to have Anthony talk about, is we started working on a game called Wild Things.

123
00:07:30,734 --> 00:07:31,514
That was tons of fun.

124
00:07:31,774 --> 00:07:35,676
And Wild Things, I can't give you numbers on it because it's only in soft launch.

125
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:47,342
But in this case, you can have an antagonist or a villain that is an elemental force, not an actual character that appears in the game.

126
00:07:47,942 --> 00:07:48,583
In this case, a...

127
00:07:49,455 --> 00:07:59,276
a storm arises and destroys the land, and that storm is part of that antagonist.

128
00:07:59,296 --> 00:08:05,217
And you're attempting to stop the damage or repair the damage that's been done by this

129
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:07,678
storm that came out of nowhere.

130
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:14,699
And then, and so your role is as kind of this guardian angel kind of figure.

131
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,600
There are these spirit animals, and there are the right and there are the left.

132
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:31,424
And they choose you as a representative of the gods, so to speak, to go down into the wild lands and attempt to thwart the evil designs that are happening there.

133
00:08:34,464 --> 00:08:41,866
And this is essentially your guide character, Mother Bear, who tells you what your task is.

134
00:08:42,266 --> 00:08:47,867
You have to go down to the wild lands, you have to heal the land, and you have to heal the relationships between the parents.

135
00:08:54,955 --> 00:08:59,720
Yes, so this is a new release game developed by Graphite Lab right here in St. Louis.

136
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,405
It's Roller Coaster Tycoon Story, the latest installment of a Roller Coaster Tycoon game.

137
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:09,289
As the name indicates, it's also their first title to have a moving out story.

138
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:16,175
What Graphite Lab did is when they came to us to write the story, they had a set of predetermined main characters.

139
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:18,637
But the one thing they were missing was the billing.

140
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,051
villain character that would be a central source of conflict with the park.

141
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:29,954
And that character up there is Sam, he's your guide character, much like Tiffany, Matthews,

142
00:09:30,014 --> 00:09:33,415
and Manchin. He's speaking about a character named Lan Follari.

143
00:09:33,795 --> 00:09:37,797
And this is a park that's been around the island for years, and Lan Follari has come in

144
00:09:37,917 --> 00:09:41,339
and he is just wrecked it, he dumps his trash there, because he owns it, he owns it.

145
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:45,741
He doesn't care. And the big thing about Lan Follari

146
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:49,723
is that a lot of times in these games, you kind of start out the game with your guide character coming

147
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:50,783
across and meeting this

148
00:09:51,213 --> 00:09:52,814
big antagonistic character.

149
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,576
But in this game, Sam has already known Lank O'Leary,

150
00:09:55,616 --> 00:09:57,817
they've already been kind of duking it out for years.

151
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:00,239
And what really makes Lank O'Leary different

152
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,380
is that by the time the player starts the game,

153
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,961
the player has already beaten him.

154
00:10:04,622 --> 00:10:07,023
Lank O'Leary's big thing is that he wants this park

155
00:10:07,063 --> 00:10:09,364
for himself because he wants to turn it into a landfill.

156
00:10:09,785 --> 00:10:11,466
But simply just by starting the game,

157
00:10:11,506 --> 00:10:13,247
the player has already bought that park.

158
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:14,788
They've already beaten Lank O'Leary

159
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,389
by taking the park away from him,

160
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,290
making him at his most desperate

161
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,071
simply because he just started the game.

162
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,891
Anyway, Blair, he's this kind of central character, too,

163
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:28,211
where he's not immediately in the game at the start.

164
00:10:28,251 --> 00:10:30,112
He's there, he's kind of pink jagged,

165
00:10:30,152 --> 00:10:31,452
he sees piles of garbage.

166
00:10:31,872 --> 00:10:34,252
So when he does show up, it's a pretty big impact.

167
00:10:36,293 --> 00:10:39,353
That takes us to the next element of storytelling,

168
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:41,074
and that is mystery.

169
00:10:43,474 --> 00:10:45,675
Continuing on with Rollercoaster Tycoon,

170
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:48,455
that was absolutely key to building that story,

171
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:49,875
which that's just a really common theme.

172
00:10:51,056 --> 00:10:52,536
Yeah, so the other thing about...

173
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:54,953
these patterns that they blend a lot.

174
00:10:55,013 --> 00:10:58,374
So not only does Rollercoaster Tycoon have its antagonists

175
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:00,334
and essential sorts of conflicts,

176
00:11:00,354 --> 00:11:02,755
but those antagonists can overlap with the mystery,

177
00:11:03,115 --> 00:11:04,976
which we see with another character I introduced

178
00:11:05,036 --> 00:11:05,896
called the Phantom.

179
00:11:06,296 --> 00:11:09,357
And the Phantom was my own personal Scooby-Doo-like villain,

180
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:11,878
some masked kind of Austrian character

181
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:13,798
that goes around sabotaging the park.

182
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:17,099
And he brings this source of mystery

183
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,080
because it's stretched out for so long.

184
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,531
little whispers, little people like, oh, do you see the phantom running around?

185
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:33,253
And sorry, the big thing though with the phantom is that you have this mascot character. We have

186
00:11:33,273 --> 00:11:38,534
little Tyler right there. He's the big bumbling panda bear on the icon of the game. He's there

187
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:40,795
where you see the source of all fun and

188
00:11:41,498 --> 00:11:45,660
love and inspiration of the park and by the end of the game you find out that Lil' Tyler

189
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,520
is the Phantom.

190
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,062
And you just go along with this big mystery, not only that he's the Phantom, but why?

191
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:53,663
And that's something that we discovered through playing the game itself.

192
00:11:56,044 --> 00:12:01,326
So in Wildlands, the mystery of course is, you know,

193
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:06,096
wild lands, and why would it come from a positive.

194
00:12:06,196 --> 00:12:12,218
In addition, right from the very beginning, Liam hints that he feels some sort of guilt

195
00:12:12,238 --> 00:12:12,578
about it.

196
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:20,321
That he has some sort of, feels that he must have had some sort of role in the events.

197
00:12:20,481 --> 00:12:24,522
And you don't know what that is, and that's one of the mysteries you're trying to resolve.

198
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:29,663
And you show up, and you are the keeper, which is the key.

199
00:12:35,745 --> 00:12:41,350
disheveled and all dirty from the storm, and you introduce yourself to him, and that's

200
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:42,851
how you enter into that world.

201
00:12:44,092 --> 00:12:45,614
Here we use the Sioux letter for the name.

202
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:53,581
So, better than the single letter.

203
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:58,205
So, when you're doing this, you're giving, you've got a whole layer of mysteries and

204
00:12:58,225 --> 00:12:59,566
a lot of things, right?

205
00:13:05,776 --> 00:13:08,337
Then after that, it's the question of Leansville.

206
00:13:08,957 --> 00:13:11,298
What was Leansville in its events?

207
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:14,100
And what did he do, or what does he feel guilty about?

208
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,221
What went wrong in general?

209
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:18,822
Why did this come about?

210
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:20,502
Was there some force behind it?

211
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:21,863
Was there something that was done?

212
00:13:22,143 --> 00:13:24,884
Was there some act on the part of the inhabitants?

213
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:29,746
And then what can you do as that role of keeper?

214
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:34,828
What can you do to repair the wildlands and relationship with the animals, with each other?

215
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:43,970
And finally, because very early on, Liam shows some fear from all over when he encounters

216
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:47,932
these spirits, as you begin to question, can these spirits really be trusted?

217
00:13:47,972 --> 00:13:49,652
Do they have an alternate agenda?

218
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:51,253
Are there some good ones and some new ones?

219
00:13:51,953 --> 00:13:53,233
What's that spirit realm like?

220
00:13:56,174 --> 00:13:58,655
And finally, what is this world all about?

221
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:00,275
What is the central theme of this world?

222
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:01,236
What's going on?

223
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:05,857
So then there's the...

224
00:14:07,696 --> 00:14:14,283
One interesting aspect of Wild Things that's a little bit different, and that is it produces

225
00:14:14,343 --> 00:14:17,606
a hero that doesn't want you to solve the mystery, doesn't want the mystery to be solved.

226
00:14:18,347 --> 00:14:26,656
So Liam, our hero, our main character, has his best, bestest buddy, Emma the elephant.

227
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:28,598
And Emma...

228
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:31,020
has no guilt whatsoever.

229
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,542
All she knows is something terrible happened to the world she lives in.

230
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:39,187
She wants to know who caused it, why did it happen, and how do we keep it from ever happening again?

231
00:14:39,207 --> 00:14:43,751
So she comes to one of the encounters where people come across these turtles,

232
00:14:43,771 --> 00:14:49,956
and they have a whole bunch of books from a library.

233
00:14:50,976 --> 00:14:52,958
And she's like, hey, let's look through these books.

234
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:55,140
We can figure out what went on. We'll do some research.

235
00:14:57,168 --> 00:15:02,329
But Liam doesn't really want anyone to figure out what happened, and so he deflects it.

236
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:06,150
He tells her, you know, that's really important, but our main goal here is to help out the

237
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,890
other creatures in the wild now, so we need to focus on that.

238
00:15:10,171 --> 00:15:15,552
And these are our turtle characters, they are very slow, so because they're so slow

239
00:15:15,592 --> 00:15:22,933
they usually only speak in one word, sentences, so these very long, evocative words, and that's

240
00:15:23,593 --> 00:15:24,493
all you get from them.

241
00:15:24,513 --> 00:15:26,353
But somehow they still manage to communicate.

242
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:35,044
You know, Liam says we should help the turtles, and the turtles are very sad because their

243
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:37,366
areas have been devastated, and Emma advises.

244
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:39,548
She's like, you're right, you're right.

245
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:42,271
Let's not do the research, let's help these turtles.

246
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,718
So then comes the role of another game I've worked on called Sweet Escapes.

247
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,682
And as the name suggests, this game is all about sweets, and making sweets, and eating

248
00:15:54,742 --> 00:15:55,023
sweets.

249
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:02,502
And it follows a group of adorable talking animals as they go around going from sweet shop to sweet shop trying to fix things up.

250
00:16:03,203 --> 00:16:10,145
But one of the differences in Sweetscapes is that it has this originally initially prominent like antagonistic character named Buzz.

251
00:16:10,745 --> 00:16:16,787
And Buzz is the inspector. You know, he will not allow them to open the shop until he's approved it.

252
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:22,028
Which means case testing about everything they make and eating everything before they even have the chance.

253
00:16:22,994 --> 00:16:27,895
And so the big difference about Buzz though is that he has a role of mystery because he has a

254
00:16:28,575 --> 00:16:31,876
He's entirely own secret role. He's not just the inspector

255
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:37,457
He's something else and that's something that players eventually start to learn and find out by the end of the first season

256
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,058
Which flips Buzz back around to the other good guy side

257
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:46,019
Lastly we have connection

258
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,301
Which may not sound on the surface as something related to story, but just hang on there

259
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:58,087
First thing we notice is that characters connecting with each other is something that players value.

260
00:16:58,628 --> 00:17:05,049
So in this instance, you'd be surprised how many players, even though they're drawn to this as a renovation game,

261
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:09,010
always choose meet the neighbors over laying more floor.

262
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,550
Part of that is because we're drawn to faces.

263
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:18,451
We gravitate toward photos of people rather than in animalogics and other things.

264
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,032
But it's also because this is a game.

265
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:28,053
that there are going to be other characters, that the world that we're playing in is people.

266
00:17:29,374 --> 00:17:35,636
In this case, we've got Edna, who shows us a valuable lesson that connection can sometimes

267
00:17:35,696 --> 00:17:36,337
be difficult.

268
00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:41,819
She's not necessarily the friendliest neighbor on the block.

269
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:53,773
What this is doing is also introducing a feature into the game.

270
00:17:54,153 --> 00:18:00,418
So remember at the beginning of the talk I talked about how the goal and the story or the gameplay and the story have to be

271
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:07,122
integrated together. So this is a really really good example in a top-tier game where that's happening to good effect.

272
00:18:07,683 --> 00:18:14,808
So Edna comes in and it's an interesting quirky moment where you're getting to learn that this place is people with some

273
00:18:15,348 --> 00:18:17,230
interesting characters you may be challenging.

274
00:18:17,717 --> 00:18:19,698
But it's also introducing the feature

275
00:18:19,738 --> 00:18:21,920
of visiting another person's mansion.

276
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,142
So here you have a random person that you can go visit.

277
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:28,764
And the story continues, though.

278
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:33,268
We have Edna and Tiffany getting to know each other.

279
00:18:33,288 --> 00:18:36,370
We don't abandon this as writers

280
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,293
and have tutorial speak come in in this kind of dry way,

281
00:18:40,313 --> 00:18:42,374
which is like, oh, here's what you're gonna do now.

282
00:18:42,814 --> 00:18:44,696
We keep it related to the story.

283
00:18:52,272 --> 00:18:55,133
Another way that characters can connect with each other is romance.

284
00:18:55,613 --> 00:19:03,575
And this is something that can be a bit brave for a developer to try if you've never tried to do anything related to rom-com.

285
00:19:04,035 --> 00:19:13,117
But it's something that resonates with players, especially when you've got a couple of quirky characters in which those difficulties become quickly apparent.

286
00:19:13,837 --> 00:19:15,698
So in the case of Tiffany and Jack,

287
00:19:17,638 --> 00:19:19,478
we start to see that Jack...

288
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,881
is much more enamored with his work than the mansion itself.

289
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:25,842
So there may not be a wrong answer.

290
00:19:26,763 --> 00:19:31,224
But the idea that Tiffany or Jack could overcome this obstacle

291
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:35,446
of Jack's obsession with the mansion over Tiffany

292
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:39,148
is something that kind of fuels the play for quite a while in that game.

293
00:19:41,008 --> 00:19:43,409
And now we'll talk about another kind of interaction

294
00:19:43,429 --> 00:19:46,490
where the player actually gets to connect with the characters.

295
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:52,913
When we were first brought on Wild Things, this is one of the things that really, really

296
00:19:53,553 --> 00:19:59,579
excited us about this project, is that generally speaking, when you're interacting with the

297
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:05,544
characters, you're building something for them, or maybe you're providing them direction

298
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:06,265
in some manner.

299
00:20:06,325 --> 00:20:09,768
But in this case, in Wild Things, you need to actually directly interact with the characters.

300
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:13,331
So the very, very first thing that happens is you land in the Wild Things, and there's

301
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:13,831
fantastic...

302
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,802
angelic keeper being and there's poor Liam, he's been knocked unconscious from the storm,

303
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:26,285
he's totally dirty and shabby and the prompt is tap on Liam to revive him.

304
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:31,727
You have the little hand and you tap on him and he starts to shake and he coughs and sputters

305
00:20:31,807 --> 00:20:38,689
and he wakes up. And that kind of interaction happens throughout the entire game, not with Liam,

306
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:42,631
not just with Liam, but all the other various animal characters that you get introduced to.

307
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:47,860
So after you've had your first interaction with Liam and you've done your first few builds,

308
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,261
then all of a sudden Liam says, wow, I'm really disheveled and dirty.

309
00:20:52,321 --> 00:20:56,442
And you take Liam and you have, once again, you control this little scrub brush,

310
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,303
and you scrub him and lather him all up and he gets all foamy.

311
00:20:59,663 --> 00:21:03,404
And then you rinse him off and he's all happy and shiny and he dances around

312
00:21:03,424 --> 00:21:05,184
because he's very excited that you've gotten all clean.

313
00:21:05,704 --> 00:21:09,965
And it's really great. It's amazing how you feel like you've really done something.

314
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:16,177
that you just like if you have a pet and you brush your pet and they're all happy, you

315
00:21:16,197 --> 00:21:18,559
feel like you've actually interacted with this character.

316
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:23,922
And then, as I said, it's not just Liam.

317
00:21:24,623 --> 00:21:28,285
There's a scene where Emma is really tired and she feels like she needs a break.

318
00:21:28,725 --> 00:21:32,568
So you get a rubber ball and you get to throw the ball and it bounces around and she chases

319
00:21:32,648 --> 00:21:33,048
it.

320
00:21:33,528 --> 00:21:35,129
It's very, very cute and adorable.

321
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:39,372
And there's a scene with Emma on the skateboard and Liam does the break dancing.

322
00:21:40,017 --> 00:21:46,602
We're always coming up with new things to add in. Oh, can we have the animals do this? Can we have the animals do that? Can we dress them up?

323
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:54,028
Whatever. So these interactions occur every single time you run through a chapter. You're going to get at least one of these, sometimes two.

324
00:21:57,891 --> 00:22:02,895
So another way you can build a connection with these types of games is through humor.

325
00:22:02,915 --> 00:22:06,078
The most humorous character in Sweet Escape is a penguin.

326
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:13,001
He eats sweets all the time.

327
00:22:13,842 --> 00:22:19,203
And he has become such a popular character with the players of Swedish Games that he's started his own fanfiction.

328
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,744
Just for his weird comedic random helpers.

329
00:22:21,764 --> 00:22:26,005
You know, like in this scene where he tried to vote himself mayor.

330
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:30,266
Scoops is a character that people laugh at just because he's so lovable.

331
00:22:30,326 --> 00:22:31,666
He's such a goofball.

332
00:22:32,006 --> 00:22:34,687
That by the time everyone was asking, like, hey, where's Scoops?

333
00:22:34,847 --> 00:22:36,947
Or, hey, you know, I noticed he wasn't in the last contest.

334
00:22:36,967 --> 00:22:38,308
It's like, why the heck wasn't he in the last contest?

335
00:22:39,457 --> 00:22:44,618
He's just a source of humor and you really can't support it.

336
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:50,840
Sometimes though, a way to really, really make that connection, bring it home, is that

337
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,461
the success in connection is the actual win in the game.

338
00:22:54,981 --> 00:22:59,523
So in this case, especially in Wild Things, one of the primary objectives is to bring

339
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:01,103
these animals back together.

340
00:23:01,383 --> 00:23:02,964
You're encountering these various animals.

341
00:23:16,785 --> 00:23:19,627
In this case, you've got a little family of meerkats.

342
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:24,250
This is Mimi and Melvin.

343
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,092
Mimi and Melvin are meerkats and they're six kids.

344
00:23:28,853 --> 00:23:29,093
And...

345
00:23:29,113 --> 00:23:30,914
Minky, Minky and Monkey.

346
00:23:30,934 --> 00:23:31,695
Minky, Minky and Monkey.

347
00:23:31,715 --> 00:23:33,296
I think that's what it is.

348
00:23:33,436 --> 00:23:35,857
Monkey is a little monkey.

349
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:42,602
So, you've got the meerkat kids and the meerkats and they run this...

350
00:23:42,642 --> 00:23:44,163
It's a mine but it's also a shop.

351
00:23:47,848 --> 00:23:52,532
integrated, you do all these things to bring them back together, and it all culminates

352
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,973
in a big family dinner.

353
00:23:54,153 --> 00:23:57,896
Because what could be more, we're a family again, than having a big family dinner.

354
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:03,801
You're actually invited to be with them and sit with them, oh man, that's a lovely family

355
00:24:03,821 --> 00:24:03,981
dinner.

356
00:24:04,481 --> 00:24:10,165
And so you've won that, you've completed the object of this arc, you've succeeded, you've

357
00:24:10,205 --> 00:24:12,547
brought the family back together again, you're rewarded for that.

358
00:24:15,469 --> 00:24:17,231
That's so long, I'm just going to talk to her, okay?

359
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:17,651
Thank you.

360
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:21,429
Another way we love to do that is through megajokes.

361
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:23,530
And especially me, I love my megajokes.

362
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:28,351
This is kind of one of those moments where we call out the main player as someone who isn't allowed to speak.

363
00:24:28,811 --> 00:24:34,532
So the way a lot of the screen mechanics is pointing out that, yeah, you are the player, you are financially supporting all these characters,

364
00:24:34,572 --> 00:24:39,734
you are the one fixing everything, but highlights the plot that you can't actually say anything to these characters.

365
00:24:39,874 --> 00:24:41,774
At least not in this generation of film games.

366
00:24:45,922 --> 00:24:52,707
So, last thing I want to point out, one of the things that we have the greatest impact on in

367
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:59,173
the title, Lily's Garden, was creating a sense of a character that never appears on screen.

368
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:05,618
So, your great aunt, who is the one who bequeathed you this garden that you have to restore,

369
00:25:06,219 --> 00:25:11,243
never appears, but her story gets told through the things that you discover throughout the game.

370
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,472
And here's a photo, she's a very quirky person,

371
00:25:15,532 --> 00:25:17,453
and so this idea of stinging to the bees,

372
00:25:17,493 --> 00:25:19,414
which becomes actually one of the tasks

373
00:25:19,474 --> 00:25:21,636
and the interactions and part of the restoration,

374
00:25:22,296 --> 00:25:24,378
is absolutely embedded in her character.

375
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,283
So to sum up, we talked about three things,

376
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:33,464
and we actually used an acronym, CMC.

377
00:25:33,524 --> 00:25:36,386
So just think Renegade and CMC.

378
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:38,107
Conflict, Mystery, and Connection,

379
00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:40,129
these are the elements that we're always talking

380
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:41,150
to our developers about.

381
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:47,331
Conflict really does mean bad things happen, and that's okay.

382
00:25:47,391 --> 00:25:49,231
You don't have to see people suffer.

383
00:25:49,271 --> 00:25:51,312
I have a teacher who used to say,

384
00:25:51,352 --> 00:25:53,093
torture your characters.

385
00:25:53,493 --> 00:25:54,734
If nothing's happening,

386
00:25:54,774 --> 00:25:57,915
Heaven is a place where nothing ever happens,

387
00:25:57,935 --> 00:25:58,775
that's boring.

388
00:25:58,815 --> 00:26:01,096
You want to give some kind of confluence,

389
00:26:01,116 --> 00:26:03,497
you have to feel the lows in order to appreciate the highs.

390
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:06,718
You might meet a bad guy,

391
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,079
but the villain doesn't always have to be a bad guy.

392
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,621
The villain can be an antagonizing force.

393
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,883
Like that storm that Anthony was talking about, or this guy that killed in a panda suit that Dexter was talking about.

394
00:26:38,315 --> 00:26:42,096
Sometimes the quest to solve a mystery can be thwarted by your own hero.

395
00:26:42,716 --> 00:26:47,838
Sometimes the hero doesn't want to mystery you, and that's okay, and it could be an interesting

396
00:26:47,878 --> 00:26:48,639
level of complexity.

397
00:26:53,721 --> 00:27:00,103
Enhancing is a key opportunity for acquisition and intentioning amongst the player base.

398
00:27:03,084 --> 00:27:04,925
Players should connect with the characters.

399
00:27:08,037 --> 00:27:13,379
And sometimes that means romance, and sometimes it means absolutely nothing, but the opposite

400
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:13,959
of romance.

401
00:27:15,479 --> 00:27:17,340
And the connection is ultimately the win.

402
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,421
It's the victory and success that are important in the game.

403
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:22,661
All right.

404
00:27:23,661 --> 00:27:24,762
That concludes our talk.

405
00:27:24,782 --> 00:27:26,482
Here's our website if you want to know more.

406
00:27:27,282 --> 00:27:31,883
We're happy to stick around for questions, and I just want to thank...

407
00:27:32,727 --> 00:27:36,930
Anthony and Dexter who literally practiced this this evening at 6 o'clock

408
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:42,434
as their only prep for this besides the fact that they worked on the games and just had that knowledge in them.

409
00:27:42,475 --> 00:27:53,463
So I hope they did a good job.

410
00:27:53,483 --> 00:27:54,264
Thank you so much.

411
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:54,844
Applause

412
00:27:54,864 --> 00:27:55,365
Applause

413
00:27:55,385 --> 00:27:55,625
Applause

414
00:27:55,645 --> 00:27:55,785
Great.

415
00:27:55,825 --> 00:27:56,306
Thank you.

416
00:27:56,866 --> 00:27:57,547
Questions?

417
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:04,816
So, what do you guys use?

418
00:28:05,496 --> 00:28:09,760
What's your process for writing the stories and creating the characters?

419
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:13,124
What is that? Do you do storyboards?

420
00:28:13,424 --> 00:28:17,008
What does that process look like to come up with your ideas?

421
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:19,630
Yeah, it really depends on the client.

422
00:28:20,294 --> 00:28:26,559
So sometimes a client comes to us with a game that they've tested and they're not having the results.

423
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:33,384
So in that case we have some semblance of story and characters that we need to then fix.

424
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:38,988
In other cases they come to us and they want to partner and collaborate and so

425
00:28:39,488 --> 00:28:45,092
the roller coaster tycoon story, they had some idea already because obviously they'd have to

426
00:28:45,132 --> 00:28:47,474
pitch and work with Atari to get the thing approved.

427
00:28:48,464 --> 00:28:54,408
But Dexter and I sat down with the Graphite Lab team here in St. Louis and we talked about

428
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:57,270
the characters and then created the story arc.

429
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:03,774
So we helped them develop the characters and then we created the arc with them in collaboration,

430
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:05,375
which was a neat process.

431
00:29:06,075 --> 00:29:10,938
We actually, this is outside these games, but we have worked on interactive novels as

432
00:29:10,998 --> 00:29:11,199
well.

433
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:13,820
I've done four of them and Dexter's done one.

434
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:18,733
And with those, you know, it's really more like a novel.

435
00:29:18,793 --> 00:29:20,214
So the writer comes up with it.

436
00:29:20,234 --> 00:29:23,735
I mean, you still pitch and get approved,

437
00:29:23,815 --> 00:29:26,496
and then you tweet based on feedback and stuff like that.

438
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,257
So you're still working with the developer,

439
00:29:28,737 --> 00:29:33,239
especially on the gameplay integration with it.

440
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,641
Here's some ideas on how you might integrate that.

441
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:00,922
And then sometimes they'll just say,

442
00:30:01,102 --> 00:30:02,883
thank you, that's all, here's a check,

443
00:30:02,923 --> 00:30:06,465
and we'll have our own writer's board on that.

444
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:08,026
I know for a game like Swayze Gates,

445
00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:10,127
some things we do, I sometimes have these documents

446
00:30:10,207 --> 00:30:12,869
called H-O-V-E, high-level design documents.

447
00:30:13,329 --> 00:30:16,071
So for Swayze Gates, I will plot out the story arcs

448
00:30:16,131 --> 00:30:17,872
of each chapter, and I'll kind of make you

449
00:30:17,932 --> 00:30:19,312
like 10 chapters in advance.

450
00:30:19,712 --> 00:30:21,493
And then we share that document with the team,

451
00:30:21,513 --> 00:30:23,074
and they'll go like, yeah, maybe like that,

452
00:30:23,094 --> 00:30:24,775
and stuff, and flush it out from there first.

453
00:30:26,772 --> 00:30:32,335
And then it's working on a project that has an approval from a very large, powerful company.

454
00:30:32,935 --> 00:30:34,256
And then there's a whole other load in there.

455
00:30:34,556 --> 00:30:35,697
Yeah, that IP.

456
00:30:36,097 --> 00:30:39,298
So that means the client looks at it and gives us feedback.

457
00:30:39,358 --> 00:30:43,981
And then the IP stakeholders, which could have a whole bureaucracy of their own,

458
00:30:44,401 --> 00:30:45,681
have to also weigh in.

459
00:30:45,841 --> 00:30:48,383
So that becomes a very large process.

460
00:30:48,963 --> 00:30:50,284
So we've done the whole gamut.

461
00:30:50,324 --> 00:30:55,126
We have, right now, we have literally one guy and a team in Ukraine.

462
00:30:56,112 --> 00:30:59,253
of like writers, or artists, and programmers,

463
00:30:59,353 --> 00:31:00,754
and it's a very small team,

464
00:31:00,814 --> 00:31:03,275
like almost people working out of their garages,

465
00:31:03,976 --> 00:31:07,458
all the way up to a very recognizable IP

466
00:31:07,918 --> 00:31:11,660
with like Hollywood connections and serious bureaucracy.

467
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,261
So it's a, you never know.

468
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,463
Good question.

469
00:31:17,983 --> 00:31:18,243
Yeah.

470
00:31:18,964 --> 00:31:20,805
So if a client

471
00:31:21,384 --> 00:31:26,970
If Client absolutely insisted that just based on the entire world of the gamer, it cannot be conflict, like,

472
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:28,211
uh, there's...

473
00:31:29,393 --> 00:31:30,914
for whatever scenario that would be,

474
00:31:31,495 --> 00:31:35,058
is it possible that if you just focused on connection history instead,

475
00:31:35,078 --> 00:31:39,583
that could the weight of those two make up for the lack of conflict within the community?

476
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:57,613
is the classic mystery. We do have the client I've referred to. We're in a, right now we're

477
00:31:57,653 --> 00:32:02,275
in a conversation in which we may fall on the side of, you know, we don't really want you

478
00:32:03,075 --> 00:32:11,799
to add conflict, drama, real storytelling arcs. Instead what you get is like character vignettes,

479
00:32:12,999 --> 00:32:18,341
which you can do. I play a lot of Farmville 1 and 2.

480
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:24,901
And if you have two, you'll know there's not a story in Fondle, but there's characters

481
00:32:24,981 --> 00:32:27,864
and they have little backstory kind of things.

482
00:32:27,944 --> 00:32:29,025
So those are vignettes.

483
00:32:29,045 --> 00:32:30,346
I mean, nothing's happening.

484
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:33,109
It's not like, ooh, there was a conflict.

485
00:32:33,169 --> 00:32:35,712
I had a fight with that person and now I got to do this.

486
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:39,495
None of that, but it's a vignette and maybe that's enough.

487
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:49,155
that book shows what keeps you until 3 a.m.

488
00:32:49,215 --> 00:32:51,057
and suddenly you've watched seven episodes

489
00:32:51,077 --> 00:32:53,218
and you don't know why, you get up and go to work.

490
00:32:53,258 --> 00:32:56,561
You know, it's because of that book.

491
00:32:56,581 --> 00:33:00,684
I worked in a previous life for Wizards of the Coast

492
00:33:01,144 --> 00:33:06,248
and we had as a licensor a very, very large company

493
00:33:06,408 --> 00:33:11,432
that was headed by a very powerful personality.

494
00:33:11,933 --> 00:33:14,174
And they made it very, very clear that why

495
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,141
currently can you issue?

496
00:33:54,181 --> 00:33:56,201
It depends on how many students at SLU.

497
00:33:56,221 --> 00:33:57,682
We can broker students.

498
00:33:57,862 --> 00:34:02,843
What are we working on right now?

499
00:34:02,883 --> 00:34:04,743
So we have three for one client.

500
00:34:04,903 --> 00:34:05,503
And then...

501
00:34:07,664 --> 00:34:10,784
It really varies because of the scope.

502
00:34:11,305 --> 00:34:14,505
So, like one client of ours currently we've been

503
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,826
working with for three years. So I started out

504
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,106
freelancing for them.

505
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:26,673
as a solo and then they kept adding games and then I was getting other games and so I built the team out and we're still working with them

506
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:33,195
and they have us on two regular ones right now. So anywhere from probably 5 to 20.

507
00:34:34,336 --> 00:34:44,399
Yeah, one of the things that really varies wildly is that you can have a game that can easily take up 20 or 30 hours of a person's time a week.

508
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:47,900
And then you might have another one that's like, okay, here's five hours of work.

509
00:34:48,907 --> 00:34:51,109
And then the next week it's five hours of work.

510
00:34:51,209 --> 00:34:52,831
And the next week, and the next week, and the next week.

511
00:34:52,931 --> 00:34:54,813
Or the short-term ones where they're like,

512
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:57,076
look, we know you guys are the experts

513
00:34:57,156 --> 00:34:58,217
and we just want you to weigh in

514
00:34:58,257 --> 00:35:00,580
on why this isn't performing in dark tasks.

515
00:35:01,281 --> 00:35:04,324
So give us 40 hours to do an analysis.

516
00:35:04,384 --> 00:35:05,486
In two weeks, right?

517
00:35:05,766 --> 00:35:06,887
Do an analysis in two weeks.

518
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:08,429
And then they'll take.

519
00:35:26,497 --> 00:35:37,383
So I'm a thousand levels into Matchington Mansion, and I'm still wondering, will Jack and Tiffany ever get together?

520
00:35:38,984 --> 00:35:42,006
The moment they do, the game's over.

521
00:35:42,506 --> 00:35:48,970
Yeah, I mean, think about like X-Files or Friends, you know?

522
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:49,771
Or Cheers.

523
00:35:50,111 --> 00:35:50,891
Cheers, yeah.

524
00:35:52,495 --> 00:35:54,595
getting together and break them up and get them together.

525
00:35:54,615 --> 00:35:57,196
We have another one we're working on right now where it's like

526
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:01,316
there's two couples and they have parallel relationships

527
00:36:01,336 --> 00:36:03,277
and sometimes crossing over and

528
00:36:03,977 --> 00:36:05,557
yeah, it gets complicated.

529
00:36:05,777 --> 00:36:08,098
Like I know, I think it's re-escaped so I'm happy about it.

530
00:36:08,118 --> 00:36:10,818
You know that thousand level markers finally allowed them to be together

531
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:14,899
through the main characters but like the condition could be that they're not like official.

532
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:18,660
They have to be like, are there or are they not like the other thousand levels.

533
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,100
Yeah.

534
00:36:28,197 --> 00:36:29,438
romance event.

535
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:33,702
That's right. It's been a number of levels.

536
00:36:33,842 --> 00:36:36,204
We'll never get to that.

537
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,664
Yeah.

538
00:36:37,065 --> 00:36:37,325
Cool.

539
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:38,686
Last question.

540
00:36:39,146 --> 00:36:42,429
Thank you all.

541
00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:43,951
Do you guys have certain

542
00:36:43,971 --> 00:36:45,572
strategies for tying narrative

543
00:36:45,692 --> 00:36:47,574
into different types of games, like say

544
00:36:47,654 --> 00:36:49,896
a puzzle game versus like

545
00:36:49,956 --> 00:36:51,297
you were saying, like the visual novel

546
00:36:51,317 --> 00:36:53,659
sort of stuff. Do you guys have different strategies depending on

547
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,341
what genre of game and how you tie that into

548
00:36:56,403 --> 00:37:04,486
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, not to be crass, but you know, if the games don't make money, we all go home and we don't have jobs.

549
00:37:05,087 --> 00:37:10,969
So it has to do with monetization and in mobile games, especially free to play, the game is free.

550
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:18,812
So then you have to create all these different ways to have the game make money so that we can keep making the game, right?

551
00:37:18,832 --> 00:37:19,992
It's like a chicken and egg thing.

552
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:25,474
So are these hybrid narrative builder games with a match three or a collapse mechanic?

553
00:37:27,557 --> 00:37:32,679
You've got the monetization around the puzzle, and then how the tasks integrate with that,

554
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:34,560
and what cliffhangers you might set up.

555
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,201
That's definitely part of it.

556
00:37:37,481 --> 00:37:43,504
In the interactive novels, it's ironic because even though those are so story-driven and

557
00:37:43,544 --> 00:37:48,927
the content is so heavily story, if you play choices, you have to play choices.

558
00:37:49,347 --> 00:37:55,670
So I wrote one of those, one called Failed Secrets, and what I learned from that is

559
00:37:59,495 --> 00:38:07,421
too on another project where you're using story content to monetize and it

560
00:38:07,621 --> 00:38:14,467
becomes very sticky, right? You don't want players to feel like they're

561
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:18,150
being niggled and dined or anything like that to get the story so there's a real

562
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:24,175
craft to creating a story and then building on extra experiences that

563
00:38:24,255 --> 00:38:28,979
warrant the extra pay, right? The extra currency value.

564
00:38:33,023 --> 00:38:38,126
So, this hasn't been released yet, this game, but it has been announced, so I think we can

565
00:38:38,146 --> 00:38:48,591
just, in broad strokes, talk about it, which is marrying that narrative storyline with

566
00:38:50,552 --> 00:38:53,813
a game mechanic so that you get two of those...

567
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:55,174
Choices with a matchstripe.

568
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:56,034
Choices with a matchstripe.

569
00:38:56,054 --> 00:38:57,035
You can imagine that, right?

570
00:38:57,055 --> 00:39:01,617
So that, the advantage of this is that you still might have premium choices.

571
00:39:16,439 --> 00:39:21,882
course somewhere along the line you're just like, oh man I can get five more stars out of this game.

572
00:39:22,002 --> 00:39:28,386
Just add a little more, just a dollar ninety-nine, you know, whatever. And in those sorts of games

573
00:39:28,426 --> 00:39:32,988
there's an old saying that seems to be pretty true, it's the 80-20 rule. When I was teaching

574
00:39:33,028 --> 00:39:39,292
at Webster I used to teach this, which is that in games like that, 80% of the people who play

575
00:39:39,352 --> 00:39:44,735
your free game are not going to give you a dime, they're just going to grind it. But 20% will give

576
00:39:44,775 --> 00:39:45,716
you some money.

577
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:48,946
Now of that 20%, it also breaks down 80-20.

578
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,467
80% of the people who give you money

579
00:39:51,607 --> 00:39:53,968
will give you just enough to break even,

580
00:39:54,508 --> 00:39:56,049
and all your profit is in that 20%, 20%.

581
00:39:56,149 --> 00:39:59,210
Those are what they call the whales.

582
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,910
And those are the people who will spend

583
00:40:01,591 --> 00:40:03,851
a very large amount of money on a regular basis.

584
00:40:06,552 --> 00:40:08,993
And then there's the 80% who only spend a little bit,

585
00:40:09,013 --> 00:40:09,613
but they add up.

586
00:40:09,733 --> 00:40:11,714
But they add up too, yeah, that's what you break even.

587
00:40:14,272 --> 00:40:17,434
I love it too, just depends on what type of genre audience you're going for.

588
00:40:17,454 --> 00:40:22,056
Obviously when we get a game like Space Cage, it's going to be a lighthearted game with a lighthearted story,

589
00:40:22,136 --> 00:40:28,419
and funny humor, whereas we get in a novel, it's like a fantasy, more graphic, more violent.
