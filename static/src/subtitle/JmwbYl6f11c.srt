1
00:00:10,697 --> 00:00:12,698
Thanks Matthew, hopefully this thing's working.

2
00:00:12,818 --> 00:00:13,318
Okay, good.

3
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:18,281
So, you're not special, nor is your game,

4
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:19,942
and you'll never ship a hit.

5
00:00:20,802 --> 00:00:20,882
Woo!

6
00:00:20,902 --> 00:00:20,962
Woo!

7
00:00:20,982 --> 00:00:21,062
Woo!

8
00:00:21,162 --> 00:00:21,243
Woo!

9
00:00:21,263 --> 00:00:21,423
Woo!

10
00:00:21,523 --> 00:00:22,763
Woo!

11
00:00:25,105 --> 00:00:27,866
That's the uncomfortable reality for most of us.

12
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:30,328
And the sooner you can come to terms with that,

13
00:00:30,408 --> 00:00:32,609
the sooner you can start figuring out

14
00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:34,430
just how to survive as an indie.

15
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,631
And of course, the longer you survive, the greater the chance

16
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:42,553
that one day your game will be special and you will ship a hit.

17
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:47,936
So I'm Jake Burkett, and I love making games.

18
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,336
I love designing games.

19
00:00:49,396 --> 00:00:50,117
I love coding.

20
00:00:50,737 --> 00:00:52,518
And I love shipping games as well.

21
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,840
So I went indie in 2005, and I've made a whole bunch of

22
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,761
commercial games.

23
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:00,422
Most recently, Regency Solitaire.

24
00:01:01,398 --> 00:01:04,939
I also love doing game jams and one game a month, and I made a

25
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,401
bunch of sort of free mini games. And I also cofounded

26
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:13,282
FullIndie in Vancouver, which has got over 3,000 members. It's

27
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:16,823
a pretty awesome meetup group. And I run the UK version, so if

28
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,063
you're in the UK, look up fullindie.co.uk.

29
00:01:21,558 --> 00:01:22,859
So I'm a no-hit wonder.

30
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,382
Plenty of talks are out there about hits,

31
00:01:27,862 --> 00:01:29,123
or maybe abject failures,

32
00:01:29,183 --> 00:01:30,984
and you know, there's the failure workshop down there.

33
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:34,246
But there aren't many stories about people

34
00:01:34,286 --> 00:01:35,607
who survive for a long time,

35
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:38,028
and I've survived for over a decade now.

36
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:40,150
And that's what I'm gonna talk about today.

37
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:45,474
I've shipped over 10 games, all of them have sort of made some kind of profit, ranging

38
00:01:45,514 --> 00:01:47,576
from very poor to okay.

39
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:52,760
And I've meticulously collected a lot of data, which I'm going to share with you today.

40
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:57,710
I'm a firm believer that you should focus on your own games

41
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,912
instead of working for other people, and I'm going to explain

42
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:05,916
in detail why. I also think that having a long tail is extremely

43
00:02:05,956 --> 00:02:09,138
important, is vital to your success, and having a back

44
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:13,681
catalog is a really powerful effect. Also, you need to be

45
00:02:13,781 --> 00:02:16,242
adaptable and determined. These are traits that you need to

46
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:17,223
develop over time.

47
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,769
I want to change your mindset from

48
00:02:19,789 --> 00:02:21,552
I've made a hit game,

49
00:02:21,573 --> 00:02:23,276
sorry, I want to make a hit game,

50
00:02:23,696 --> 00:02:26,241
to I want to build a sustainable business.

51
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:28,305
Now that's not as glamorous sounding,

52
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:30,569
but I do believe it's more realistic.

53
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:35,972
So the legendary Jeff Vogel, he said nobody knows anything.

54
00:02:36,552 --> 00:02:40,914
And there basically aren't any magic bullets.

55
00:02:40,934 --> 00:02:43,355
You hear about big hits and so on.

56
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:46,277
But we've got this problem where if you only hear about

57
00:02:46,297 --> 00:02:49,938
the successful games, you're sort of ignoring all of the

58
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:52,219
failures, and I don't think it's painting

59
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,340
a realistic picture.

60
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:58,506
One example is Indie Game the Movie. I like that movie a lot.

61
00:02:59,227 --> 00:03:05,134
But it sort of could lead you to believe that if you wreck yourself physically and emotionally for several years,

62
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:10,822
and then you ship on Xbox, everything will magically be okay.

63
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:17,791
which obviously I don't agree with that. So for years I've been searching for the magic

64
00:03:17,851 --> 00:03:22,192
formula for game dev success and I've asked people why they think their games are a hit.

65
00:03:22,632 --> 00:03:27,273
Some are honest and they say, I got lucky, I don't really know why I was successful.

66
00:03:27,973 --> 00:03:33,834
And good for them. Others think it was PR and marketing that got them successful and

67
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:40,876
going to shows. Others say it was YouTubers and Twitchers who made them famous. But there

68
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:42,736
isn't really any clear cut answer.

69
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:46,337
and you know you might wish to be like John Blow maybe

70
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:52,120
but the thing is you weren't him from birth you didn't grow up in the same

71
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,340
place you didn't learn the same things as him

72
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:57,002
you didn't ship the same game at the same time as him

73
00:03:57,922 --> 00:04:03,304
so in order to be authentic in the games that you create you need to

74
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,785
connect to something in yourself and let that come out through your work

75
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:08,466
and you can't do that if you're trying to be someone else

76
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:11,688
so how do you define success well

77
00:04:12,717 --> 00:04:15,339
I asked this question to the dev community on Twitter

78
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,261
and got lots of answers.

79
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:22,485
Some people define success as shipping any game at all.

80
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:24,888
And yeah, that's a really good starter.

81
00:04:25,328 --> 00:04:28,611
Others thought it was if players enjoyed their game

82
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:30,773
or if they innovated and made something new.

83
00:04:31,353 --> 00:04:33,455
Some people have got loftier ambitions

84
00:04:33,515 --> 00:04:36,178
and want to retire comfortably or own a Tesla.

85
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:39,155
that's not happened to me yet

86
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:43,258
and others, you know, most people really said

87
00:04:43,278 --> 00:04:46,660
to be successful is to be able to continue making games

88
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,762
for a long time and that's what this talk is about

89
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:56,754
So we all know what this sort of indie dream is but the reality is quite different.

90
00:04:56,934 --> 00:04:58,195
It is very hard work.

91
00:04:58,636 --> 00:05:05,322
Have you ever watched your basement dwelling, noodle eating, single indie friends get rich

92
00:05:05,842 --> 00:05:08,625
while you struggle to feed your family and pay the mortgage?

93
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:09,766
I have.

94
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:16,532
maintaining motivation in those sort of times is quite tricky.

95
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:21,578
You know, there are far easier things we could be doing as indies,

96
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:25,362
but why do we do it? We do it because we love it, because we want to make games.

97
00:05:26,022 --> 00:05:28,825
So how can we keep making games for a long time

98
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:32,229
in the face of things like the indie apocalypse?

99
00:05:32,789 --> 00:05:38,770
Is there such a thing? Probably. I think this sort of thing has happened many times before in different platforms

100
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:46,972
and it will happen again. But if you're fast, the market is fast moving, and if you adapt and you plan for sustainability

101
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:48,713
then hopefully you'll be more resilient.

102
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:55,474
So we're going back through the mists of time to 1984. That was my first computer.

103
00:05:56,294 --> 00:06:00,955
And it came with a manual that taught me how to program BASIC and I started making games.

104
00:06:01,892 --> 00:06:07,875
And then I got a Commodore 64 and an Amiga, and they were some of the most fun computing times I've ever had.

105
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:10,636
And I've played a lot of games over the years.

106
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:14,058
You might remember when games came in massive boxes like this.

107
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,620
I'm glad you can download them now.

108
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,942
So for some reason I ended up in my 20s making business software.

109
00:06:22,783 --> 00:06:26,625
And we made stock control and accounting systems, which sounds kind of boring,

110
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:28,946
but I learned a lot from that process.

111
00:06:29,944 --> 00:06:36,571
And in my spare time I was working on a kung fu platform game called Iron Fist that I was very passionate about.

112
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:41,376
And I was staying up every evening until 4am and all weekend programming this thing.

113
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,879
And I soon realized that I couldn't go on like this because I felt like a zombie.

114
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,065
And I had a sort of early midlife crisis and decided to quit my job and go full time.

115
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:56,548
Now at the time, I had no savings. We just moved to a bigger house.

116
00:06:56,988 --> 00:07:00,430
We'd had a second child and my wife was a full-time mother.

117
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,731
And I said to her, oh I want to make games for a living.

118
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:12,375
And she, thank goodness for her, she said, well she trusted me and had faith in me to do that because I believed in it.

119
00:07:12,816 --> 00:07:19,719
So that was great, although I just wondered if she was sleep deprived and she'd have agreed to me being a professional juggler or something.

120
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:32,271
So I worked on Iron Fist full time for quite a while and was enjoying it, but I soon realized that the scope was just too big and it was going to take forever to finish.

121
00:07:33,032 --> 00:07:38,358
And also at the time there was no market for it. There was no Steam, there was no Xbox Live Arcade.

122
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,121
and all sort of games were sold via download.com or the casual portals

123
00:07:44,522 --> 00:07:47,763
and I just didn't think that I could make a go of this type of game

124
00:07:48,063 --> 00:07:52,405
I probably could now but not then so I decided to abandon the game

125
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:59,828
and start on a smaller project so the point is I wanted to ship a game

126
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:02,409
and get experience in shipping a game and see what that whole

127
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:07,031
whole thing was like and then improve upon that and around that time I saw

128
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:08,711
this is the the first one

129
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:12,128
and I liked it a lot and I thought, hey, I could make a game like that

130
00:08:12,548 --> 00:08:13,549
with a different theme

131
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:17,412
and some levels and kind of new mechanics.

132
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:20,655
Now I know to most of you making a match 3 probably sounds horrific

133
00:08:20,955 --> 00:08:21,595
but I actually

134
00:08:22,276 --> 00:08:26,239
like that genre and had fun making games in that genre.

135
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,941
So I made a Christmas themed match 3 game

136
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,064
and to save money I used stock art,

137
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:33,745
stock photos,

138
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:37,668
stock music and I even used the Comic Sans font.

139
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:40,591
There we go.

140
00:08:41,993 --> 00:08:45,039
So this game, it actually played pretty well, I still believe,

141
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,542
but it looked like ass.

142
00:08:46,883 --> 00:08:47,684
And as a result...

143
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,062
it sold uh... eighteen hundred dollars worth, that's net not gross that's what

144
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:53,742
I've received

145
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:58,645
uh... and that is over a hundred and twenty months okay so ten years

146
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:04,269
what's interesting though is over on the right you can see it's still selling a

147
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:07,591
few units even now even today and we'll come back to that

148
00:09:08,111 --> 00:09:08,491
later

149
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:15,538
So, I know kind of how long it took to make, and worked out that it was, it earned me about

150
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,102
$6.50 an hour, so I would definitely call that a fail.

151
00:09:20,183 --> 00:09:25,088
However, the fact it sold even a single copy made me think, okay, well let's try this again.

152
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:30,310
and I thought I know what to do, I will reuse the engine and make an Easter themed match 3 game

153
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,352
and instead of using stock art, I'll pay a friend of mine to make some pixel art

154
00:09:35,632 --> 00:09:39,053
because I'm sure that's what casual gamers will love, pixel art right?

155
00:09:40,294 --> 00:09:43,235
obviously looking back I realized what an idiot I was

156
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:46,356
because the game didn't do very well either

157
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:49,397
this has made nearly $3,000 over 10 years

158
00:09:50,097 --> 00:09:51,937
so that's not done very well

159
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:53,938
another fail

160
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:59,281
So around this time, and in fact for the next two games, I didn't make any money at all.

161
00:09:59,561 --> 00:10:02,502
For 18 months, we just didn't make any money from games.

162
00:10:03,322 --> 00:10:09,585
And I had to do IT consultancy to make ends meet, so I had to sort of set up networks and get rid of viruses.

163
00:10:09,945 --> 00:10:17,889
And my wife, she did science writing and got a part-time job at the university to make ends meet.

164
00:10:18,229 --> 00:10:22,371
We also got out loans. We told them it was for home improvements, but it wasn't.

165
00:10:22,851 --> 00:10:23,732
And we...

166
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:32,539
We shuffled money around on credit cards using 0% deals, so I'd buy all my food on credit cards and shuffle the money around.

167
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,184
We also got low income tax credits from the government and we used that to pay childminders so we could keep working.

168
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:43,108
So we lived very frugally, we didn't do anything fun and it was kind of not a great time.

169
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:46,171
Of course I'm not advising this, I'm just saying this is what I did.

170
00:10:48,712 --> 00:10:53,876
And it's very much possible to survive, you know, if you want to find a way and I sort of did.

171
00:10:55,357 --> 00:10:59,181
Yeah, if you're starting out, clearly you need some kind of runway. Don't do what I did.

172
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:02,684
Even if you're making your tenth game, you still need some kind of runway.

173
00:11:02,964 --> 00:11:07,228
You've got to make sure you can reach the end of it without, you know, selling your soul.

174
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:11,192
So, the only thing is, a lot of people procrastinate.

175
00:11:11,272 --> 00:11:16,777
So maybe sometimes there is something to be said for just getting started and figuring out things as you go along.

176
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:21,301
Once you start something, and it's difficult to go back...

177
00:11:21,862 --> 00:11:25,367
your brain starts working on solutions as to how to sort of move forward

178
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:28,571
and that's something I found anyway. So after

179
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:32,136
Easter bonus and it's sort of flop I got contacted by

180
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:39,406
a guy, an American at the time, who I've still never met to this day, who said that the Wizard

181
00:11:39,447 --> 00:11:44,671
of Oz book IP was going to expire in a hundred years, and it would become public domain.

182
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:50,335
And we could use the book IP and make a match three game. And he said he would pay for the

183
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:55,719
art and a musician, and I just had to code it for free, and we would share the revenue

184
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:59,462
at the end. Again, that's not something I'd advise, but he seemed to know what he was

185
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:00,143
talking about.

186
00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:04,545
and he had some good contacts and I thought okay let's give it a go

187
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:07,066
and the game actually did turn out very well

188
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:13,969
and I also had to switch to a new technology and make a new engine which I sold on the

189
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:17,870
BlitzMaxx forums and I sold two hundred copies of this engine for fifty dollars each

190
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:22,592
and those people paid me for the privilege to fix my engine and tell me

191
00:12:22,652 --> 00:12:25,053
how to improve it so that was pretty neat

192
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:32,749
One of the things this opened my eyes to was the fact that it's definitely worth spending money on art and audio.

193
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,412
I do really believe that if you make your game look good, it will sell better.

194
00:12:39,532 --> 00:12:46,094
That's not always the case, but it really is kind of obvious and I see a lot of games come out and I'm like, that just won't sell.

195
00:12:46,234 --> 00:12:49,135
People won't equate it with value because it doesn't look good.

196
00:12:50,196 --> 00:12:54,839
So how did the Wizard of Oz do? Well, you may not see this sort of low level stuff, but

197
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,143
seven years after it sold I did a mobile deal with a publisher and got a big sort of advance

198
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:06,027
on sales. So anything can happen in the lifetime of a game. That's seven years later. We can

199
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:11,190
look at that in aggregate and you can see that the last five years had a whole new boost

200
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,432
of revenue, and I'll talk about how I did that in a moment.

201
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:19,110
So it's made about $90,000 net, about $250,000 gross.

202
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:23,654
It didn't cost me anything to make because somebody else paid for the art and so on.

203
00:13:24,015 --> 00:13:25,916
And it's made me about $100 an hour.

204
00:13:26,657 --> 00:13:30,301
But it's taken nine years to get that much money, right?

205
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:35,966
At the time, in the first year, it only made $20,000, and we thought it was a flop.

206
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:38,969
So it's a success now, but it was a very long success.

207
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:43,991
I also thought, okay, well I can improve upon this and make another Christmas-based match

208
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:48,693
three, but this time with better graphics. So I paid, well actually I had to persuade

209
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:54,796
my wife to let me spend $2,000 on art. The 3D shapes are actually made by the guy who

210
00:13:55,176 --> 00:14:00,058
made the robots in Rise of the Robots, if any of you remember that game, and 3D rendered

211
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:00,658
backgrounds.

212
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:05,520
I had to make it very quickly because Christmas was looming

213
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,503
and the thing with seasonal deadlines is you can't move them

214
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,665
you can't phone up the Pope and say, hey man, can you move Christmas to February

215
00:14:14,685 --> 00:14:16,206
because my milestone is delayed

216
00:14:16,746 --> 00:14:20,248
it's not going to happen. But that game

217
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:24,090
overall has done pretty well. Each of those spikes is Christmas

218
00:14:24,911 --> 00:14:25,091
and

219
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:30,113
every year

220
00:14:31,807 --> 00:14:38,211
And if we look at it in aggregate, we can see that the most recent five years, again, have done better than the first five years.

221
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:46,838
And that's because, well, the re-promotion each year was I went back to the casual portals and said, just emailed them and said, will you re-promote my game? And they did.

222
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:49,580
If you don't ask, you won't get promotions. You've got to try.

223
00:14:50,581 --> 00:14:57,086
And some portals that wouldn't take the game early on changed their standards. They probably dropped them and then took my game.

224
00:14:58,487 --> 00:14:59,107
So that was good.

225
00:15:00,152 --> 00:15:04,557
And I also got the game localized, which gave it new opportunities.

226
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:09,521
And I also doubled the amount of levels in the game and slapped a gold label on the game,

227
00:15:10,482 --> 00:15:12,184
because everybody loves gold stuff.

228
00:15:13,065 --> 00:15:15,687
And that did very well and gave the game a new lease of life.

229
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,210
So keep your game alive.

230
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,773
There are many different ways you can keep your game alive way after you've shipped it.

231
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:24,656
And obviously, only do that as long as it makes sense to.

232
00:15:25,637 --> 00:15:29,319
there may be a time when you just need to let it die and move on to something else.

233
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,061
So it's made nearly $100,000.

234
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:37,005
It really didn't take me long to make, and it's made about $200 an hour now,

235
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:41,128
which was pretty good, I think, but it took a long time to get there.

236
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,822
So in the first year, it only sold a thousand units. So just

237
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:50,123
let that sink in. Only 6% of the total revenue in the first year.

238
00:15:50,844 --> 00:15:55,425
So that's why it is essential that you think long tail about

239
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:59,067
your games. And hopefully that will give you an idea that you

240
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:01,628
shouldn't really be heavily discounting your game or

241
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:05,149
bundling it in the first year or maybe ever. Okay?

242
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:10,095
So around this time, as I said I was totally desperate for cash

243
00:16:10,815 --> 00:16:12,336
because these games hadn't made any money

244
00:16:13,136 --> 00:16:17,878
and Big Fish Games, they contacted me and said would I do some contract work for them

245
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:24,321
and I signed a deal and they gave me some money and I paid off my debts

246
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:29,883
and it was like how in a first-person shooter game, when you get all shot up to shit

247
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,984
and you have to go and hide behind a wall and heal

248
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:34,005
that's what this was like for me.

249
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:44,494
So I worked on that game for nearly a year and I worked with a great designer at Big Fish called John Cutter

250
00:16:45,134 --> 00:16:49,417
and it turned out to be a casual game hit and it's been cloned many times

251
00:16:50,157 --> 00:16:53,579
and is a very popular game that people still play today.

252
00:16:56,174 --> 00:16:59,956
but I can't share the sales figures, sorry, because that's owned by Big Fish and they'd probably

253
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:06,741
stick a lawyer on my ass or something. Then after that game, they asked me to make

254
00:17:08,082 --> 00:17:10,903
another couple of games and I agreed. I made this game, Unwell Mel,

255
00:17:11,504 --> 00:17:15,907
about a dude who's got all kinds of food and bugs in his gut and you have to go in and explode them.

256
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:20,656
The theme wasn't really everyone's cup of tea

257
00:17:21,057 --> 00:17:24,123
and really any game you make the theme's not going to appeal to everyone

258
00:17:24,284 --> 00:17:25,647
unless it's about candy so...

259
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:34,825
So because these games went well, they said to me, hey, why don't you move to Vancouver

260
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:40,348
and join the studio that we're just starting up, and you can work there. So I talked to

261
00:17:40,388 --> 00:17:45,971
my wife about this, and we thought it would be a great opportunity for us and our kids,

262
00:17:46,571 --> 00:17:54,575
and so we moved over there. The overall experience was good, for sure, in Vancouver. So, oh,

263
00:17:54,835 --> 00:17:56,556
I'm on the wrong slide. Sorry, guys.

264
00:17:58,102 --> 00:18:02,624
that was the thing about contract work. Obviously I chose good contract work there and I've had lots

265
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:07,247
of offers of terrible contract work over the years and you really got to know which ones are right

266
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:14,950
for you and within your skill set. But I moved to Vancouver and one thing that I made sure happened

267
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,813
was I was allowed to keep my company so I made sure the contract said I could keep Grayling Games

268
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:25,415
whilst I worked for them because I didn't see it as like a long-term thing that I would do forever.

269
00:18:26,957 --> 00:18:29,601
So I learned to say yes to opportunities.

270
00:18:29,861 --> 00:18:32,645
Early on I became manager of the business software company.

271
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:34,989
I also ended up running an aikido club

272
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,813
and I moved to Vancouver to work for this studio.

273
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:40,297
All of these things have been growth experiences

274
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:41,659
and I'm glad I said yes to them.

275
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:52,311
that's my dad he's the guy who bought me the spectrum in 1984 and sadly he passed

276
00:18:52,371 --> 00:18:58,393
away when i was working at big fish games and it was a big big shock for me um and i like to think

277
00:18:58,954 --> 00:19:04,576
he you know can see what i've uh the successes i've had up to now and that he would be proud

278
00:19:04,616 --> 00:19:08,918
of me but unfortunately i'm an atheist so i don't think that's happening

279
00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:20,217
that day

280
00:19:20,877 --> 00:19:26,603
is passing was that uh... i re-evaluated what was important to me in life

281
00:19:27,243 --> 00:19:31,267
that was things like my family uh... you know how i spend my spare time and what

282
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:33,409
i'm working on and what the long-term goals were

283
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,801
So that is when I really began to learn to say no to things.

284
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:40,361
Okay, so, you know, if you ship on mobile,

285
00:19:40,381 --> 00:19:42,022
you get all these ridiculous emails through

286
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:44,282
about ad monetization platforms.

287
00:19:44,603 --> 00:19:46,603
If you ship on Steam, you get all these emails

288
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,084
through about key giveaways.

289
00:19:49,284 --> 00:19:50,624
This is a great opportunity for you

290
00:19:50,684 --> 00:19:52,785
to give away 10,000 copies of your game.

291
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:54,485
No, no it's not.

292
00:19:57,664 --> 00:20:03,706
But you also get some deals that maybe do sound quite juicy and you think, oh, maybe I'll do that, you know, this crappy bundle or that crappy bundle.

293
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:12,428
But you have to evaluate them all in terms of, will they help me grow and will they meet my business's long-term goals?

294
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:17,069
And if they don't, you know, and they're just some kind of fun distraction, you have to ditch them and...

295
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:25,254
move on. So whilst I was in Vancouver, I co-founded a group called Full Indie with Alex Vostrov.

296
00:20:26,216 --> 00:20:27,779
Any Full Indie members in the house?

297
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:35,843
But this happened because in 2007, I went to an indie meetup in Birmingham in the UK.

298
00:20:36,463 --> 00:20:43,309
And we met in Cliff Harris' hotel lobby and got very, very drunk until about 4 a.m. in the morning.

299
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:48,654
But it was actually a revolutionary thing for me because I got to meet other developers.

300
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:53,215
and find out what they're up to. But it was just the fact that

301
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:56,417
somebody understood what I was doing, sorry, and the problems

302
00:20:56,437 --> 00:20:59,178
that I was going through. And that for me was revolutionary,

303
00:20:59,198 --> 00:21:03,259
and that's why I wanted to set up Full Indy in Vancouver. Full

304
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:07,341
Indy now has monthly meetups with over 3,000 members it's

305
00:21:07,381 --> 00:21:08,921
got. They don't all turn up at once, so it would be a

306
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:12,722
nightmare. They also have game jams and an annual conference.

307
00:21:12,742 --> 00:21:16,064
They've done three conferences, so there will hopefully be one

308
00:21:16,104 --> 00:21:18,765
next year. Go to Vancouver. It should be awesome.

309
00:21:19,956 --> 00:21:27,899
Now, most people tell you to do networking, but for me, networking is really about making friends.

310
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:40,243
I don't have any co-workers or no HR department to support me, so being part of a like-minded group is very powerful and really important to me.

311
00:21:40,663 --> 00:21:46,125
So I've been to game jams, shows, meetups, and I spend far too much time on social media.

312
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,676
But one of the things I've learned is it's really

313
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,398
important to help people out, to share information.

314
00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:56,321
And when you start sharing information and tips and so

315
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:57,641
on, it comes back to you.

316
00:21:58,062 --> 00:22:01,424
And over the years, I've got consultancy gigs and found

317
00:22:01,464 --> 00:22:05,647
investors, and just got loads of really useful tips to help

318
00:22:05,687 --> 00:22:06,667
me sort of move forward.

319
00:22:08,949 --> 00:22:11,410
In fact, the main reason I would say I've survived, as

320
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:13,832
in India, is because other successful developers have

321
00:22:13,872 --> 00:22:14,332
helped me out.

322
00:22:15,455 --> 00:22:20,879
Unlike business software where you have to basically keep everything secret from your competitors and they do the same with you

323
00:22:21,479 --> 00:22:23,120
Indies aren't competitive

324
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,682
We're collaborative and yet long may that continue

325
00:22:28,674 --> 00:22:35,499
So, after a while at Big Fish Games, I decided that corporate life wasn't for me, and I quit.

326
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:45,067
And I quit with some experience. I also had a Big Fish Games pension, which I immediately cashed in to make a runway for my next game.

327
00:22:46,086 --> 00:22:47,726
So I made a game called Spring Bonus.

328
00:22:48,306 --> 00:22:49,827
I'm a bit soppy about the spring.

329
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:53,147
I like the flowers and so on, and I like the fact

330
00:22:53,187 --> 00:22:54,108
the sun is coming back.

331
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:58,248
So I enjoyed making this game, and I used social media

332
00:22:58,288 --> 00:22:59,829
to recruit artists.

333
00:22:59,889 --> 00:23:02,389
And I made a big list of them and tested them

334
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:04,009
and went through and picked the ones I needed.

335
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,390
And I crowdsourced localization.

336
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,771
That would probably make localization experts cringe,

337
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:11,011
but it totally worked for me.

338
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:16,674
and I learned about using metrics and doing extensive testing at Big Fish Games

339
00:23:17,094 --> 00:23:19,375
so I was able to push the game out to a load of people

340
00:23:19,955 --> 00:23:20,456
get their

341
00:23:21,656 --> 00:23:24,238
stats back and then balance the game accordingly

342
00:23:25,158 --> 00:23:25,998
the best thing was

343
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:30,381
I actually shipped the game seven minutes after my non-compete with

344
00:23:30,421 --> 00:23:31,641
Big Fish Games expired

345
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:39,309
So this is what the graph of someone panicking looks like.

346
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:46,773
I logged the amount of hours I work on every game and I was cruising through January, February,

347
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:50,415
you can see it there, and then in March I was like, oh my God, Easter is a month away,

348
00:23:50,435 --> 00:23:53,396
I need to actually finish this game and get it out the door.

349
00:23:54,637 --> 00:24:00,160
Now that highest peak of 84 hours or something, on the day I was supposed to ship the game,

350
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,443
the night before I'd stayed up all night long and I tested all the levels, had one hour

351
00:24:05,463 --> 00:24:05,783
of sleep.

352
00:24:06,732 --> 00:24:08,293
and was making the final build.

353
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:12,275
My wife came into the office and said she didn't feel very well

354
00:24:12,916 --> 00:24:14,317
and I had to take her to hospital.

355
00:24:14,877 --> 00:24:16,178
And when she was in hospital,

356
00:24:17,138 --> 00:24:19,340
they said she had a rare form of cancer

357
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,200
and

358
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:23,543
luckily it was a treatable form.

359
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:25,724
And because we lived in Canada,

360
00:24:26,284 --> 00:24:27,525
who has a health care system,

361
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:34,500
wish you any US guys who've got a sort out as I can't believe it anyway she got

362
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,301
the treatment she needed and I'm very pleased to say that she has the all

363
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:45,802
clear now but that was an extremely tense launch game launch and since then

364
00:24:45,842 --> 00:24:50,003
it was very harrowing for her but it was tough for me and the kids as well and I

365
00:24:50,043 --> 00:24:53,744
had a whole summer just very listless didn't really feel like doing anything

366
00:24:53,804 --> 00:24:55,365
considered quitting making games

367
00:24:56,225 --> 00:25:01,128
I actually sort of took some medication and sort of managed to come out of that time period

368
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:07,673
eventually, but it was very tough and it reminded me that unhealthy deadlines are just not good and

369
00:25:07,693 --> 00:25:12,616
to try to avoid those. I'm not, I still haven't perfected that but this is something we need to

370
00:25:12,656 --> 00:25:17,800
treat ourselves with respect because you don't know when the proverbial will hit the fan,

371
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,183
you know, when some kind of family thing will crop up and cause a problem.

372
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,381
Anyway, how did Spring Bonus do after all the agony?

373
00:25:26,662 --> 00:25:27,822
That's five years of sales.

374
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:29,843
There were small bumps for Spring.

375
00:25:30,324 --> 00:25:34,025
And it's made pretty good money, $18,000 net revenue.

376
00:25:35,086 --> 00:25:37,947
It didn't cost me much to make because I paid the artist

377
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:40,728
an upfront to sort of say, I'm serious about this.

378
00:25:40,788 --> 00:25:41,709
Let's get started.

379
00:25:41,949 --> 00:25:44,130
And I gave them revenue on the back end.

380
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,650
And that's worked very nicely for me.

381
00:25:46,531 --> 00:25:47,991
And I recommend that approach.

382
00:25:48,092 --> 00:25:50,633
It's obviously easier if you've shipped games before

383
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:52,093
and they trust you.

384
00:25:54,511 --> 00:26:00,693
One of the things is it's made about $130 an hour total, but it could have made way more if I

385
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:10,416
hadn't wasted hours and hours on stupid mobile ports, because mobile is not very good. I've

386
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:15,538
tried mobile games for three of my games. Developers actually came to me and said, hey,

387
00:26:15,578 --> 00:26:18,399
would you let me port your game to mobile?

388
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:24,279
and we do a revenue split. And I've tried that and the thing is it's really boring and

389
00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:27,901
soulless. They send you these builds and then they don't work very well and you have to

390
00:26:27,941 --> 00:26:32,082
send them back feedback and keep testing them. And then you have to do all the iOS provisioning

391
00:26:32,162 --> 00:26:37,965
profile crap, which is just horrible. And at the end of the day, they don't make that

392
00:26:38,005 --> 00:26:41,606
much money. That's what I found. Obviously people have had different success with them.

393
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:46,711
And so for spring bonus, the green bit is what it made from mobile.

394
00:26:47,031 --> 00:26:50,174
It made $12,000 from mobile, which I split with the dev,

395
00:26:50,795 --> 00:26:52,437
and, OK, that's more than zero,

396
00:26:52,817 --> 00:26:55,260
but it meant that I wasn't focusing on something else,

397
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,803
which is desktop games, which is where my skill set lies.

398
00:27:00,477 --> 00:27:06,102
So after Spring Bonus, I worked with Clay Entertainment for a bit on Eats Munchies in various roles.

399
00:27:06,603 --> 00:27:14,490
And Jamie Cheng is the CEO there, and he helped us out at a time when we really appreciated his help, financially and so on.

400
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:20,696
And so I learned a lot from him. He's an expert at business. If you can ever accost him and get some tips, do so.

401
00:27:20,716 --> 00:27:23,539
He'd probably hate me for saying that because he's a busy guy.

402
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:32,264
And I also did a lot of consultancy work around the time because I built up a reputation as knowing what to do in casual games.

403
00:27:33,005 --> 00:27:41,269
And now it's time to talk about this graph, which is the dollars per hour of all of the projects I've worked on.

404
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:45,311
The green one in the middle is when I was an employee at Big Fish Games.

405
00:27:45,752 --> 00:27:47,733
Now that obviously had benefits like...

406
00:27:49,944 --> 00:27:54,708
medical and sick pay and holiday pay and a pension, but ultimately it's one of the

407
00:27:54,748 --> 00:28:00,013
lowest earning things I've done per hour even though it was a good job. And the

408
00:28:00,073 --> 00:28:05,318
blue bars apart from the first two failures which you saw are my own titles

409
00:28:05,478 --> 00:28:10,102
and they've all made more money than being an employee and being a contractor.

410
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:14,827
So early on I said there is a problem with contract work.

411
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:17,750
And the problem is that it's got a fixed ceiling.

412
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,652
Whereas if you make your own games and play the long game,

413
00:28:21,593 --> 00:28:23,575
you should hopefully come out all right in the end.

414
00:28:24,456 --> 00:28:26,217
Also, if you track your business like I've done, you

415
00:28:26,237 --> 00:28:29,279
can find out which of those projects you're working on you

416
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:29,860
should do again.

417
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,202
If I didn't track things, I might think contract work was

418
00:28:32,242 --> 00:28:33,203
great and keep doing it.

419
00:28:33,543 --> 00:28:36,065
I mean, I know there's a time and a place for it, and maybe

420
00:28:36,365 --> 00:28:37,986
a lot of us need to do it at different times.

421
00:28:38,066 --> 00:28:41,049
But just think very carefully about should you be doing that

422
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:41,970
or your own games?

423
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:49,595
So this is a breakdown of the revenue I've earned from games

424
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:51,037
over 10 odd years.

425
00:28:51,077 --> 00:28:53,179
And you can see it's come from many sources.

426
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,283
But in 2011, I decided to switch focus

427
00:28:57,323 --> 00:29:00,226
from working for other people to working on my own games.

428
00:29:00,466 --> 00:29:02,007
And that's the blue part of the graph.

429
00:29:02,168 --> 00:29:03,669
So that's going up, hopefully.

430
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:09,645
And I'm not even earning more money than I was eight years ago, but it's a hell of a lot more satisfying

431
00:29:10,466 --> 00:29:16,769
and my quality of life is a lot better. I've also got my eggs in many baskets, so I earn

432
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:23,533
income from multiple different revenue streams. That's one month in June last year. The black is

433
00:29:24,373 --> 00:29:28,015
that's a payment from the FBI for adding a backdoor into my games.

434
00:29:35,113 --> 00:29:39,721
Also on the right you can see all the different platforms I've used over the years and some

435
00:29:39,741 --> 00:29:43,447
of them have died, some of them have been bought out and there will be new ones in the

436
00:29:43,507 --> 00:29:43,928
future.

437
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:48,275
It's an ever-changing space and that's why you need to keep looking for these opportunities.

438
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:57,529
So in 2012 I decided to move back to England for many reasons. I missed a lot of my friends

439
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:01,652
from Vancouver, but I learned a lot of stuff there. I learned how to be a better designer

440
00:30:01,692 --> 00:30:07,055
and producer. I learned how to direct artists. I think there's one in the audience who probably

441
00:30:07,095 --> 00:30:12,599
disagree with me. I think you can only really herd artists, you know, in the direction you

442
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:13,139
want them to go.

443
00:30:15,118 --> 00:30:17,460
I also learned the importance of metrics and testing.

444
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:20,363
We actually worked on a free-to-play game at Big Fish Games,

445
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:22,205
but that was sort of enough to put me off forever.

446
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:25,228
And I learned about networking,

447
00:30:25,328 --> 00:30:27,550
and I joined Toastmasters, which is a really good group

448
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:29,773
if you want to improve your speaking skills.

449
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:33,256
And also, in Canada, everyone is obsessed by hockey.

450
00:30:33,376 --> 00:30:35,518
They just talk about it all the frickin' time.

451
00:30:38,485 --> 00:30:41,385
So when I got back to the UK, it cost a lot of money to move

452
00:30:41,445 --> 00:30:42,306
continents, right?

453
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:44,546
And I had to equip our house with all the sort of

454
00:30:44,606 --> 00:30:46,707
appliances and buy a car and everything else.

455
00:30:46,987 --> 00:30:50,627
And some of that debt is still on 0% credit cards today.

456
00:30:51,127 --> 00:30:55,288
And at the time, a friend of mine, Cass Prince from Puppet

457
00:30:55,308 --> 00:30:59,729
Games, he said, will you port Titan Attacks, my PC game, to

458
00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:00,290
mobile?

459
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:01,790
And I was desperate.

460
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,230
And I said, OK, yeah, let's do that.

461
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:08,294
and I like the game a lot but it turned out to be a lot more challenging to do the port

462
00:31:08,755 --> 00:31:11,477
a lot more complex than I had originally thought

463
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:16,101
so I had to sort of put it to one side and turn it into a side project while I did other things

464
00:31:16,862 --> 00:31:21,947
eventually it shipped in a humble bundle and made some money but it's one of the worst

465
00:31:21,987 --> 00:31:27,912
performing projects I've ever worked on so do not make decisions out of desperation

466
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:34,781
It's really important to remember that every game project will take longer than you think it will take.

467
00:31:35,122 --> 00:31:36,543
A game project is never quick.

468
00:31:37,444 --> 00:31:43,431
And you really need to explore your options very carefully before you decide what project to work on.

469
00:31:44,372 --> 00:31:47,015
I know that's kind of obvious, but just remember it.

470
00:31:47,555 --> 00:31:49,297
So, whilst...

471
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:54,543
I should have been working on Titan Attacks. I ran out of money, so I needed to make another

472
00:31:54,563 --> 00:32:00,368
game and I made this game Spooky Bonus. A lot of people thought Spring Bonus was for

473
00:32:00,448 --> 00:32:05,333
kids because of the Easter theme, so I thought, well, okay, let's make a darker game. And

474
00:32:05,393 --> 00:32:09,156
after living in Vancouver, I realized that North Americans are obsessed by Halloween.

475
00:32:09,437 --> 00:32:13,681
We're nowhere near as obsessed by this in the UK. And so I thought, let's do a Halloween-themed

476
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:13,901
game.

477
00:32:14,742 --> 00:32:19,465
I spent some money on art and music and so on. I had to get a loan to spend that money.

478
00:32:20,225 --> 00:32:26,330
And it's actually done very well indeed. It was a casual game hit and it's made, it's

479
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:30,773
actually our best selling game to date. The only problem with casual game hit is the portals

480
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:36,497
take most of the money, like 70% of it. You get 30. It's the opposite of Steam. So even

481
00:32:36,517 --> 00:32:41,400
though it made them a lot of money, it did me okay, but it wasn't my golden ticket.

482
00:32:42,255 --> 00:32:46,919
So why did it work out well? Well, it was a very small scope. It took me three months to make.

483
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:52,904
It definitely resonated with the audience. I spent money on art, made it look good.

484
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:57,968
I didn't do a mobile version. I focused just on making the PC one as good as possible.

485
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:02,832
It was localized at the beginning, and it was my seventh Match 3 game.

486
00:33:03,593 --> 00:33:06,015
I don't know if I should be ashamed of that or proud of that.

487
00:33:06,897 --> 00:33:09,799
But by that point, I knew what I was doing

488
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:10,959
and it turned out well.

489
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,621
We launched at a good time in the casual market,

490
00:33:13,661 --> 00:33:14,721
which is sort of dying now,

491
00:33:15,522 --> 00:33:17,022
and I launched on all the right portals,

492
00:33:17,323 --> 00:33:19,664
and I even got an advance from one of them

493
00:33:19,684 --> 00:33:22,185
to give them an exclusive deal,

494
00:33:22,205 --> 00:33:23,506
which really helped with cash flow.

495
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:26,529
The most important thing I learned was

496
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,072
everyone loves exploding pumpkins

497
00:33:29,853 --> 00:33:32,476
so if you can fit one of those into your game somewhere

498
00:33:32,497 --> 00:33:34,359
uh... maybe make

499
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:35,721
Shara in the

500
00:33:36,642 --> 00:33:39,666
Shara shower with a pumpkin simulator or something like that

501
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,047
I think you'll be okay

502
00:33:42,257 --> 00:33:49,520
So while we were making Spooky Bonus, my wife suggested we make a Regency-themed Jane Austen

503
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:54,463
romantic card game. And I said, actually, that sounds like a really good idea. No one's

504
00:33:54,503 --> 00:33:59,465
done it before. And so I asked her to work with me as researcher, designer, and designer.

505
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:06,328
tester and so on. And she agreed and we made the game. But at the beginning we heard about a

506
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:12,196
grant for the southwest of England, which is a sort of tech wasteland that I live in. I think

507
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:17,724
we've only had computers for a few years. Mostly it's just tractors and stuff.

508
00:34:19,672 --> 00:34:24,116
And we heard about this grant, we pitched for the grant, and we got it.

509
00:34:24,576 --> 00:34:28,059
And I did all these things which you should do to get a grant,

510
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:31,282
but basically they're the foundation of a good business plan,

511
00:34:31,422 --> 00:34:32,763
and you should do it for all of your games.

512
00:34:33,384 --> 00:34:35,926
I think one of the things that helped is I had a track record,

513
00:34:36,086 --> 00:34:36,807
and I said to them...

514
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:40,031
I said to them, hey, at the end of this funding,

515
00:34:40,271 --> 00:34:41,693
you want to tick a box which says,

516
00:34:42,173 --> 00:34:45,297
you backed some projects which actually made some money

517
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:46,338
and were successful.

518
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,761
And if you want to tick that box, back me.

519
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:49,402
And they did.

520
00:34:49,802 --> 00:34:51,204
So that worked out pretty well.

521
00:34:53,118 --> 00:34:58,202
Nevertheless, the game took longer than planned, and I had to find other funding sources.

522
00:34:58,222 --> 00:35:00,284
This is a recurring theme, you may notice.

523
00:35:01,105 --> 00:35:03,647
So I tried to get a bank loan, but that was just no good.

524
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:08,190
They're not interested in indies because you don't have anything they can come and send

525
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:12,954
around guys with baseball bats to collect if you don't pay the money back.

526
00:35:14,055 --> 00:35:18,039
I actually ended up getting a loan from another indie business, which took like 30 minutes

527
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:21,622
to set up, and that came about through making friends.

528
00:35:22,545 --> 00:35:24,805
I also put my own personal savings into the game

529
00:35:25,526 --> 00:35:30,227
and we managed to get tax credits for the game in the UK. You may have some

530
00:35:30,267 --> 00:35:31,347
similar thing in your area.

531
00:35:32,427 --> 00:35:34,028
Our tax credits were tied into

532
00:35:34,648 --> 00:35:38,409
making a culturally British game, which ours was, and we actually were able to

533
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:43,190
claim back 25% of our salaries, which was pretty cool. I got that in a

534
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,671
lump sum at the beginning of this year.

535
00:35:45,886 --> 00:35:51,550
I didn't do crowdfunding. I'd rather convince one investor that the milestone is delayed

536
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:58,214
than 10,000 braying Kickstarter users. Your mileage may vary, but that's just my particular

537
00:35:58,694 --> 00:35:59,235
paranoia.

538
00:36:00,845 --> 00:36:05,106
So there's apparently a Jason Della Rocca, he's a very clever guy, he's doing a whole talk

539
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:10,347
about funding, so if you've got a full pass, you might want to go and check that one out. So how

540
00:36:10,387 --> 00:36:17,549
did Regency Solitaire do? Well, it turned out to do very well on the casual portals, and it

541
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:22,590
got, people love it, they gave it great reviews, it won a few awardy type things. The only

542
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:30,632
thing it didn't get is an IGF nomination, and I'm not bitter or sour about that at all. I

543
00:36:36,356 --> 00:36:40,279
One thing to note is that it made 14% of its revenue on Steam.

544
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,641
So most of its revenue was off of Steam.

545
00:36:43,142 --> 00:36:46,605
However, it only got press once it came out on Steam.

546
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,786
And it's kind of a bit of a sad fact

547
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:52,289
that games aren't really viewed as validated as games

548
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,891
until they've come out on Steam.

549
00:36:54,131 --> 00:36:55,652
I don't really like that, really,

550
00:36:55,692 --> 00:36:57,754
but that seems to be the way things are.

551
00:36:59,323 --> 00:37:03,287
So as I mentioned, I worked with my wife on Regency Solitaire.

552
00:37:03,507 --> 00:37:04,948
We did the whole thing like this.

553
00:37:07,386 --> 00:37:13,027
for a year. Normally I'd advise against hiring employees because they're a sort of can of worms

554
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:19,749
in terms of finances and legal stuff, but we'd been together for 15 years at that point and we

555
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:23,349
sort of knew what we were getting into, even though Helen's friends said, you know, it would

556
00:37:23,389 --> 00:37:28,810
drive me insane working with my husband. But we managed that by having different office spaces,

557
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:33,732
we come together for meetings and then we can go back and be introverts in our own spaces again.

558
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:37,684
But we discussed the design together, the visual design,

559
00:37:37,704 --> 00:37:39,765
the story, all kind of aspects of the game.

560
00:37:39,785 --> 00:37:43,346
And we also shared PR and marketing duties,

561
00:37:43,846 --> 00:37:46,427
which was great because that sort of thing

562
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:47,367
can be a bit of a drag.

563
00:37:48,888 --> 00:37:51,909
And we also indulged our passion in British history

564
00:37:51,949 --> 00:37:55,490
and went to various locations for research, which was nice.

565
00:37:57,367 --> 00:37:58,548
But it was a learning curve.

566
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:01,450
Helen expected certain amounts of mentorship,

567
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,692
and I had to balance that with the reality of shipping

568
00:38:03,732 --> 00:38:04,312
an indie game.

569
00:38:05,433 --> 00:38:07,295
She had to get used to using Photoshop

570
00:38:07,355 --> 00:38:10,017
to do all of the sort of art direction and so on.

571
00:38:11,418 --> 00:38:14,621
And we did do a lot of design by committee.

572
00:38:14,921 --> 00:38:17,563
And as I'd done a lot of design over the previous 10 years,

573
00:38:17,924 --> 00:38:20,105
there were some arguments about that sort of thing.

574
00:38:22,452 --> 00:38:24,893
Also, Helen had to make the story fit the game.

575
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:27,113
So she was used to sort of writing,

576
00:38:27,153 --> 00:38:30,134
but we had to change the story many times

577
00:38:30,194 --> 00:38:31,194
to make it fit the game.

578
00:38:31,254 --> 00:38:33,595
So that's something that was a learning curve for us.

579
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:35,435
And I had to be a project manager

580
00:38:35,495 --> 00:38:37,276
for not only the artists and the musicians,

581
00:38:37,636 --> 00:38:38,496
but for my wife.

582
00:38:39,056 --> 00:38:41,537
Can you imagine being a project manager for your partner

583
00:38:41,597 --> 00:38:43,737
and telling them what they should work on and why?

584
00:38:44,377 --> 00:38:46,178
I also had to give her timely feedback

585
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:49,638
when all I really wanted to do was hide in my room and code.

586
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:54,587
And we had different daily routines. She's a morning person and I'm an evening person.

587
00:38:54,807 --> 00:38:57,288
So we had to find one sort of part of the day that worked.

588
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:58,468
But ultimately,

589
00:38:59,168 --> 00:39:02,689
two heads were better than one. It was really good to have an invested team

590
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:05,150
member, and this is one of the best decisions I've made

591
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,431
in the ten years, is to have someone else to bounce ideas off of

592
00:39:08,931 --> 00:39:09,851
to improve the game.

593
00:39:10,572 --> 00:39:11,992
And it's like having a jogging partner.

594
00:39:13,432 --> 00:39:16,393
They turn up to work, you turn up to work, and you get stuff done together.

595
00:39:17,603 --> 00:39:20,446
However, a friend of mine is sitting over there actually.

596
00:39:20,767 --> 00:39:23,730
He once described my life as Indie Hard Mode.

597
00:39:24,351 --> 00:39:26,493
Because when you've got kids, the thing is,

598
00:39:26,553 --> 00:39:28,135
your productivity will suffer.

599
00:39:29,156 --> 00:39:31,779
But paradoxically, you have to earn more money to survive.

600
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,282
So it's very tough.

601
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:37,165
So my advice is try to work hard and get rich

602
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:38,086
before you have kids.

603
00:39:43,952 --> 00:39:49,502
So after Regency Solitaire, I pitched an idea to Cliff Harris of Positech.

604
00:39:49,622 --> 00:39:51,285
He sort of publishes indie games.

605
00:39:51,606 --> 00:39:55,513
He actually rejected my first idea, and I went back with another one.

606
00:39:56,334 --> 00:40:02,196
which was Shadowhand, which he accepted. So he's helping fund this game, which is a sort of big

607
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:06,257
relief off my mind because I've spent most of the last ten years trying to scrabble around for

608
00:40:06,297 --> 00:40:14,240
money. And this game is a RPG card game which involves a sort of solitaire-style mechanic that

609
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:23,023
drives these battles. It's set in 1717. You're a highway woman who is an aristocrat by day and a

610
00:40:23,063 --> 00:40:24,083
highway woman by night.

611
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:30,545
and we've got a full sort of inventory system. You can even wear a beard if you want.

612
00:40:32,666 --> 00:40:35,187
There's a black one as well if you're you know into that sort of thing.

613
00:40:36,867 --> 00:40:41,729
And we've got a full sort of visual novel aspect to it like we did with Regency Solitaire.

614
00:40:42,229 --> 00:40:47,231
So that it should come out this summer hopefully and if there are any press here who want to talk

615
00:40:47,271 --> 00:40:51,672
about it I'm here for the week and we're showing off at Rezd in London in April.

616
00:40:52,805 --> 00:41:00,188
So a little while ago I asked on Gama Sutra Indies, I asked them to give me their sustainability

617
00:41:00,228 --> 00:41:07,170
tips. Don't worry if you can't read that. It's on Gama Sutra Indies sustainability top tips. You

618
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:14,432
can look it up. I got loads of them. And they contradicted each other as well. So most people

619
00:41:14,452 --> 00:41:19,094
were sort of saying stuff like spend as little as money as possible. Some of them said don't go to

620
00:41:19,154 --> 00:41:22,115
conferences. So I guess they're not here now.

621
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:29,681
and others said do spend money on art and tech and go big.

622
00:41:30,361 --> 00:41:35,464
I think the reason for the discrepancy is people are at different stages in their indie

623
00:41:35,504 --> 00:41:40,226
adventure and I do believe it is sensible early on to control your costs, figure out

624
00:41:40,266 --> 00:41:47,649
what you're doing, learn from your mistakes and then start to spend money on the right

625
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:51,611
project, whether it's your money or you've got investments or grants even better, spend

626
00:41:51,671 --> 00:41:54,752
right money on the right project later on.

627
00:41:56,252 --> 00:41:59,314
So one key thing is to be able to weather flops.

628
00:41:59,874 --> 00:42:02,515
So over the years, I've had a couple of really bad flops

629
00:42:02,555 --> 00:42:03,095
at the beginning.

630
00:42:03,455 --> 00:42:06,316
I've had games that have only made money

631
00:42:06,437 --> 00:42:07,957
after like five or 10 years.

632
00:42:08,457 --> 00:42:10,898
And I've had some hit games, but somebody else

633
00:42:10,918 --> 00:42:11,599
took all the money.

634
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:15,761
And I've had a few, you know, Spooky Bonus was pretty good.

635
00:42:15,781 --> 00:42:17,681
So I've had a few successes that have kept me going.

636
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:20,765
And Dan Cook, he's a very clever man,

637
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:22,508
and he's written a blog post called

638
00:42:22,548 --> 00:42:24,791
Minimum Sustainable Success, which

639
00:42:24,851 --> 00:42:27,095
talks about making many, many games

640
00:42:27,555 --> 00:42:30,700
and hopefully surviving by making sure

641
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,924
that you can survive not just one flop,

642
00:42:32,944 --> 00:42:34,245
but multiple flops in a row.

643
00:42:35,605 --> 00:42:39,668
My biggest and perhaps most important tip is to get a cat.

644
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:42,411
This is my cat, Suki.

645
00:42:42,891 --> 00:42:45,774
She is very fluffy and stroking her

646
00:42:45,874 --> 00:42:49,697
is just the best possible thing you can do for stress

647
00:42:50,098 --> 00:42:51,919
and I must have come up with so many ideas

648
00:42:51,979 --> 00:42:53,921
sitting in that chair in the garden.

649
00:42:55,976 --> 00:42:59,898
Another thing I need to give a nod out to, some old people will know this reference.

650
00:43:01,138 --> 00:43:07,241
In 2004 I read Cultivate Burning Desire by Steve Pavlina and it set me on a path of,

651
00:43:07,841 --> 00:43:10,082
well that's what made me go indie when I read that article.

652
00:43:10,443 --> 00:43:11,723
It made me quit my job and everything.

653
00:43:11,963 --> 00:43:13,584
I'm not sure if I should thank him or not.

654
00:43:15,473 --> 00:43:17,813
But I did follow a path of personal development

655
00:43:18,074 --> 00:43:21,094
and looking at what motivates me and how I can be more efficient

656
00:43:21,134 --> 00:43:21,514
and so on.

657
00:43:21,675 --> 00:43:23,875
It's a whole separate topic, but it really

658
00:43:23,955 --> 00:43:27,296
did help me get where I am today.

659
00:43:27,616 --> 00:43:28,856
And there's a lot more work to do.

660
00:43:29,777 --> 00:43:34,058
So this is the graph of someone who didn't give in.

661
00:43:34,098 --> 00:43:38,559
This is my revenue from my own games over the last 10,

662
00:43:39,239 --> 00:43:39,599
11 years.

663
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,640
It's going pretty well now.

664
00:43:44,145 --> 00:43:46,146
but it's taken a long time to get here.

665
00:43:47,086 --> 00:43:48,407
And there's no guarantee that

666
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:51,007
the future will be bright either.

667
00:43:51,468 --> 00:43:53,928
But one thing is that I'm kind of certain of

668
00:43:54,068 --> 00:43:55,929
is that I will find a way somehow.

669
00:43:56,249 --> 00:43:58,490
I always sort of find a way to keep going.

670
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,510
And there's a lot of advice out there

671
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:03,191
for how you can succeed.

672
00:44:04,151 --> 00:44:06,832
And hopefully you've got some ideas from my story.

673
00:44:07,975 --> 00:44:10,396
But what ultimately makes the biggest difference is you,

674
00:44:11,176 --> 00:44:11,956
and what's in you,

675
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,037
and whether you've got the will to survive.

676
00:44:15,157 --> 00:44:18,078
On the flight over here, I watched the latest Rocky movie.

677
00:44:18,178 --> 00:44:20,578
Okay, it's pretty good, it's like Rocky 7 or something.

678
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,379
And in it, he says something like,

679
00:44:24,659 --> 00:44:27,920
one step at a time, one punch at a time,

680
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,260
one game at a time.

681
00:44:30,961 --> 00:44:33,061
And that, my friends, is how you do it.

682
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:34,581
Thank you.

683
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:52,921
So yeah, if you have any questions, please find a mic.

684
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:55,042
Great, thanks for the talk.

685
00:44:55,162 --> 00:44:56,182
My name is Mark Mikulek.

686
00:44:56,382 --> 00:44:58,002
I am also an indie game developer.

687
00:44:58,182 --> 00:44:58,602
Hi, Mark.

688
00:44:58,823 --> 00:45:00,723
And I have three small questions

689
00:45:00,843 --> 00:45:02,223
that may have large answers.

690
00:45:03,384 --> 00:45:06,465
So the first one is Spring Bonus, you said, right?

691
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:06,845
Yeah.

692
00:45:06,885 --> 00:45:09,025
Was that a premium game or a free-to-play game?

693
00:45:09,345 --> 00:45:10,346
Oh, on mobile, you mean?

694
00:45:10,906 --> 00:45:11,126
Okay.

695
00:45:11,146 --> 00:45:12,326
Or just in general, like you said,

696
00:45:12,366 --> 00:45:13,706
it's a casual game, right?

697
00:45:13,786 --> 00:45:14,087
Oh, okay.

698
00:45:14,247 --> 00:45:17,589
Well, all of my casual download games on PC were premium.

699
00:45:17,769 --> 00:45:22,972
So people paid $9.99 or $6.99 if they're a member of a club.

700
00:45:23,493 --> 00:45:25,234
Some of the sites have a system where

701
00:45:25,894 --> 00:45:28,336
you can join up and play as many games as you want,

702
00:45:28,376 --> 00:45:29,656
like Netflix or something.

703
00:45:29,817 --> 00:45:32,318
And then I get paid per minute of play.

704
00:45:32,598 --> 00:45:35,380
One of my games, Spooky Bonus, had 5 million minutes

705
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,341
of play in the first month, which

706
00:45:37,461 --> 00:45:40,343
I think has wasted a huge amount of human time.

707
00:45:42,325 --> 00:45:49,269
But we did launch Spring Bonus on mobile and it was a demo, like a seven level demo and then at

708
00:45:49,309 --> 00:45:53,432
the end it said pay whatever to get all of the rest of the levels, which some

709
00:45:53,452 --> 00:45:57,294
people just didn't understand. They just didn't seem to get this idea. So it

710
00:45:57,314 --> 00:46:01,797
wasn't technically free-to-play, it was like gated content or something I guess.

711
00:46:02,038 --> 00:46:07,021
Demo, full version. Second question, you inferred that you do not like

712
00:46:07,101 --> 00:46:08,902
free-to-play. Why do you not like free-to-play?

713
00:46:09,322 --> 00:46:14,604
versus premium. So why don't I like free to play? Okay, so when I worked at big fish games, I read

714
00:46:14,745 --> 00:46:19,847
and studied a lot of stuff about human psychology and all the tricks and tactics you can use to

715
00:46:19,907 --> 00:46:24,088
make people spend money and about whales and all of this sort of stuff. And after doing all of

716
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:30,291
that, I just felt dirty and I decided that I didn't really want to employ those techniques

717
00:46:30,691 --> 00:46:36,714
ever again on human beings. So that's why. Great. And final question.

718
00:46:37,912 --> 00:46:40,312
You said that you've made seven match three games.

719
00:46:40,552 --> 00:46:40,713
Yeah.

720
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:44,454
Why have you, like, how different were the match three?

721
00:46:44,514 --> 00:46:47,315
Were they still, like, is it just like a reskin?

722
00:46:47,335 --> 00:46:49,235
Or were the mechanics different?

723
00:46:49,275 --> 00:46:52,196
Like, why did you sort of stick in that sort of niche?

724
00:46:52,516 --> 00:46:54,457
So why did I make seven match threes,

725
00:46:54,477 --> 00:46:55,377
and were they different?

726
00:46:56,738 --> 00:47:01,242
Okay, well basically whenever you ship a game, you never put in all the stuff you wanted to put in

727
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:03,825
and you have a big list of features you didn't complete.

728
00:47:04,345 --> 00:47:08,769
So for every game, one of those games that I made, I changed the theme up

729
00:47:09,810 --> 00:47:11,892
and I added in some more features from before.

730
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,814
that I didn't have time to do before.

731
00:47:14,054 --> 00:47:16,396
Plus the theme always kind of changes

732
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:18,358
what kind of power-ups you can put in

733
00:47:18,398 --> 00:47:20,720
and what kind of objects you can use.

734
00:47:21,721 --> 00:47:23,462
So every game improved.

735
00:47:23,502 --> 00:47:26,625
And the last game, Spooky Bonus, had quite a large meta game

736
00:47:26,705 --> 00:47:30,688
about decorating your house with very spooky objects.

737
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:34,091
And I used that same meta game in Regency Solitaire.

738
00:47:34,572 --> 00:47:37,213
So there was always an improvement for me for each one.

739
00:47:37,674 --> 00:47:39,815
Even re-skinning a game, people talk about re-skinning.

740
00:47:40,195 --> 00:47:43,258
Re-skinning a game properly still can take a couple

741
00:47:43,298 --> 00:47:46,220
hundred hours, let alone making all the new levels

742
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:47,180
and all the new features.

743
00:47:47,961 --> 00:47:48,241
Perfect.

744
00:47:48,261 --> 00:47:48,701
Thank you so much.

745
00:47:48,721 --> 00:47:49,121
Thank you.

746
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,002
Hi. Can you talk a little bit more about how you trapped your hours and if you used special software for that?

747
00:47:57,022 --> 00:48:07,386
Oh, okay, yeah. No, I'm pretty old school. I just used Excel and I just basically typed in start and end times on particular tasks and then summarized it all.

748
00:48:07,646 --> 00:48:18,570
One thing I did was, and I still do, is I categorized tasks so they might be coding, they might be testing, they might be dealing with contractors, so I'm able to look within a certain project.

749
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:22,671
on the breakdown of tasks. What I actually find is that making a game,

750
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:26,432
the coding portion might only be a quarter of the entire time.

751
00:48:26,792 --> 00:48:30,513
There's a lot of time just dealing with assets and plugging those in and doing

752
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:31,113
design and

753
00:48:31,553 --> 00:48:32,854
doing marketing and PR.

754
00:48:33,814 --> 00:48:36,134
Yeah, so that's how I do it. Just old school, but it works.

755
00:48:36,494 --> 00:48:39,715
Did you do it on a daily basis as a routine or like a weekly basis?

756
00:48:40,175 --> 00:48:41,496
Yeah, no, a daily basis.

757
00:48:41,536 --> 00:48:44,478
Every time I open up the compiler or do any work,

758
00:48:44,538 --> 00:48:45,719
I just make a log entry.

759
00:48:46,479 --> 00:48:48,921
I'm a bit sort of, yeah, what they call anally retentive,

760
00:48:49,141 --> 00:48:49,821
I think is the word.

761
00:48:50,401 --> 00:48:51,062
Looks very useful.

762
00:48:51,822 --> 00:48:52,082
Thank you.

763
00:48:52,383 --> 00:48:52,623
OK.

764
00:48:54,884 --> 00:48:55,304
Hello there.

765
00:48:55,845 --> 00:48:57,406
I was curious if you had any tips

766
00:48:57,846 --> 00:49:01,288
on how to sustain motivation through the failures.

767
00:49:01,568 --> 00:49:03,229
So there's the financials, but there's also

768
00:49:03,289 --> 00:49:04,690
the sort of emotional side of that.

769
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:08,732
So how did I sustain motivation through the failures?

770
00:49:10,776 --> 00:49:12,525
it just because well a couple of things

771
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:20,175
I sometimes think having a family is both a blessing and a curse in the sense that I've had to provide for them.

772
00:49:21,156 --> 00:49:26,641
And when you have to provide for your family, you know that you can't sort of fail.

773
00:49:26,841 --> 00:49:29,543
You've got to kind of find a way and keep going.

774
00:49:29,963 --> 00:49:33,406
And so I've always had to keep finding a way and keep going.

775
00:49:33,426 --> 00:49:35,388
So that's one sort of form of motivation.

776
00:49:36,009 --> 00:49:40,492
I also stayed motivated by doing stuff like, one time I had some money in my company.

777
00:49:41,013 --> 00:49:44,155
and I took it out and paid a small chunk off the mortgage

778
00:49:44,475 --> 00:49:47,677
and I did that because I knew that when I got hungry

779
00:49:47,697 --> 00:49:51,219
I would start to be motivated and make the next game

780
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:54,000
that's not healthy, it's not a healthy motivation

781
00:49:54,961 --> 00:49:58,343
but I knew that it sort of worked for me. Luckily I'm sort of beyond that now and

782
00:49:58,383 --> 00:50:00,924
I feel that I've made good games and I want to keep making.

783
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:06,748
good games and improve that sort of skill. So I think my motivation has changed over the years.

784
00:50:07,848 --> 00:50:11,951
But I don't know, it's such a wide topic. There's a lot of stuff about figuring out what time of

785
00:50:12,151 --> 00:50:18,234
day you work best, about having to-do lists where the easy tasks you can do here, everything's

786
00:50:18,274 --> 00:50:24,598
broken down. The whole one step at a time thing is big for me. But also at the same time visualizing

787
00:50:24,618 --> 00:50:27,460
the end goal, which is a successful game that you've launched.

788
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:32,323
I just love launching and shipping games and seeing how well they do and wanting to improve

789
00:50:32,603 --> 00:50:38,766
from one to the other. So it's a culmination of things, I guess. Thanks.

790
00:50:41,628 --> 00:50:45,030
All right, I think we are done unless anyone's got any more. Oh, one at the front.

791
00:50:47,632 --> 00:50:49,253
Maybe you better use the mic. Sorry, yeah.

792
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:07,266
Now that you kind of have all these games that have a long tail, do you find that you spend much time maintaining games that you've already released from a long time ago?

793
00:51:07,506 --> 00:51:11,268
Or has that maintaining work not stacked up against you?

794
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:15,854
Right, so do I spend time maintaining games I released a long time ago?

795
00:51:15,874 --> 00:51:18,536
I did up until recently.

796
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,979
That's how come I got this whole new lease of life from

797
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:23,340
these old games.

798
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,101
I would keep sort of maintaining them.

799
00:51:25,742 --> 00:51:27,023
It's more, to be honest, about

800
00:51:28,244 --> 00:51:30,926
maintaining a relationship with the distributors and getting them to

801
00:51:30,986 --> 00:51:31,787
re-promote the game.

802
00:51:32,627 --> 00:51:34,008
But I was maintaining them.

803
00:51:34,348 --> 00:51:36,169
But recently, I've decided to sort of let

804
00:51:36,209 --> 00:51:39,231
these 10-year-old games go to the side now

805
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:41,713
and just 100% focus on my new games.

806
00:51:41,733 --> 00:51:43,954
Because I want every hour, every thought I've got

807
00:51:44,274 --> 00:51:47,116
to be for the new games and not to be distracted.

808
00:51:47,476 --> 00:51:49,417
It'd be great if I had someone else in the team,

809
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:52,059
maybe, who did deal with all that stuff, a biz dev

810
00:51:52,139 --> 00:51:53,400
person or something.

811
00:51:54,501 --> 00:51:57,042
But it's not something I'm doing anymore.

812
00:51:59,604 --> 00:52:00,764
OK, I think we are done.

813
00:52:01,365 --> 00:52:02,025
So thank you very much.
