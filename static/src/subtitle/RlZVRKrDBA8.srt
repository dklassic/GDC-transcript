00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,820
Hello everyone. Good evening. I am psyched to be here for you all. My name is Rob Kovacs.

2
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,760
That's my real name. And I'll be performing under my video game artist name, which is

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:31,680
88bit. And I'll be playing a bunch of video game music for you on piano. Mostly NES era

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:39,320
video game music. And I'm going to start right away. But this is live. This is pre-recorded.

5
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:46,420
So I do have the chat open a little bit too. Can't really read it at the moment. But typing

6
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:52,440
the chat looks great. It makes it feel like I'm not just practicing in my room, in my

7
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,880
house here. But thank you for being here. I hope you enjoy the concert. I'm going to

8
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:52,280
play it. There we go. Short and sweet. Thank you. So that was composed by Kenichi Matsubara.

9
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:59,000
And I'm going to jump right into one of my favorite games as a kid. RC Pro-Am, composed

10
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,600
by David Wise. One of the more unique soundtracks for the NES because it uses right off the

11
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,960
bat block triads. And you don't hear a lot of triads in NES because of the limitations

12
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:19,160
of only three voices. But here we go. This is the complete soundtrack for RC Pro-Am.

13
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:55,800
another NES game. This is a game called Star Tropics. So I also like to do lesser known

14
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,920
video games from this era because there's over 680 some NES games and they all have

15
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,000
music and some really great stuff. And I really like to shed some light on some of the lesser

16
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,600
known soundtracks like this one, Star Tropics. So this is a game that was only released in

17
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:21,040
North America. And the protagonist's name is Mike Jones. It's about as generic American

18
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:26,400
name as you can get. Trying to appeal to American kids. Mike Jones liked to play baseball and

19
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:33,480
his main weapon of choice is a yo-yo. So here's the first chapter of Star Tropics composed

20
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,640
by Yoshio Harai.

21
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:25,920
There we go. The first chapter of Star Tropics. Can you guess which one was the boss theme?

22
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:34,720
Probably. Lots of whole tone. Thank you. Are you guys saying anything important in the chat?

23
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,280
Is anyone else nervous? It's just me. Right beforehand I was like, oh my gosh, I'm like

24
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,760
tired. So I'm over in Cleveland, Ohio. So Eastern time. My body's like, all right,

25
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:51,240
why don't you go to sleep and then start playing and then the heart doesn't know what to do. Now

26
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,560
it's all jumping around. So anyway, thank you for being here with me. I hope you enjoy this.

27
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,280
I am very much as well. So I'm going to change it up a little bit. I'm going to break out of the

28
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:09,280
8-bit era and do something a little more modern. So earlier this year, I got asked to make an

29
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:16,960
arrangement, a medley for the Gang Awards. They asked me to make a piano medley of the six nominees

30
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:23,760
for music of the year. So that was a lot of fun. That was a big challenge to try to mix six

31
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:31,640
completely different soundtracks together. But that was recorded and debuted for the Gang Awards,

32
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:38,160
which was thrilling to be a part of. And I'm going to play that next. So that's going to be,

33
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:47,280
I'll tell you the games real quick. It's Fantastic Creatures, REND, Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order. That

34
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:55,240
one, by the way. Spoiler alert. Undersea, Borderlands 3 and Erika.

35
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:23,280
It's Fantastic Creatures, REND, Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order.

36
00:16:47,280 --> 00:17:04,280
So that was the 2020 Gang Awards medley.

37
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:11,360
All right, I'm gonna go back to some 8-bit music here, some Nintendo music.

38
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,600
So this one is a sort of a hybrid soundtrack.

39
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,040
It was originally an arcade game and then ported over to the NES.

40
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,800
So the arcade game was Marble Madness.

41
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
That's when I played Marble Madness.

42
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,400
It was composed by Brad Fuller and Hal Cannon.

43
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,200
And Brad Fuller's unfortunately no longer with us.

44
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,080
I certainly wish I had a chance to meet him and play this for him before he passed.

45
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,640
And Hal Cannon, I know nothing about.

46
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,840
I know nothing about Hal Cannon.

47
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,680
I've searched the interwebs forever.

48
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,680
And I say this every concert.

49
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,760
If anybody knows anything about Hal Cannon, I would love to reach out to him and interview

50
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,640
him about the music for this game.

51
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,160
So I absolutely love it.

52
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,360
It's originally for an arcade game using a Yamaha, one of the first games to use a Yamaha

53
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,200
DX7 chip.

54
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,160
And so it's very unique soundtrack.

55
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,160
I'm gonna do a version that's mostly based off the NES port of it.

56
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,080
And that port was done by David Wise, who changed it up.

57
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,320
Basically he had to change it up for the limitations of the Nintendo, reducing everything

58
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,520
down to just three voices.

59
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,720
But he also changed it musically.

60
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,640
He changed melodic notes and he made it darker.

61
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,480
He made it kind of more sinister sounding.

62
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,160
So that's what I grew up on.

63
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,160
That's what I like.

64
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,040
So most of this version is gonna be on the NES.

65
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,920
Most of my arrangement is based on the NES.

66
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,720
But except for level five.

67
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:37,000
Level five is gonna be more on the arcade, more from the arcade arrangement.

68
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,320
And if you've never heard the arcade arrangement, I highly recommend checking out.

69
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,440
You can find it on YouTube.

70
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
It's just wild.

71
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
It's wild sounding.

72
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,480
So here's the whole soundtrack to Marble Madness.

73
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,160
I very much hope you enjoy it.

74
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,320
Oh man.

75
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,320
That is a fun one.

76
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:54,080
I always joke, like, that game is so hard and that sixth level music is so cool but

77
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,080
no one ever heard it.

78
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:00,360
Because nobody could ever get past the second level.

79
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,040
But that's the whole soundtrack.

80
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,840
And it's one of my favorites.

81
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,680
So I hope you enjoy that.

82
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,760
Thank you for the comments in the chat.

83
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
I see them.

84
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,760
I see them.

85
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,760
My glasses are somewhere else.

86
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,760
I can't really read them.

87
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
Okay, what do we have next here?

88
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,760
I think I'm gonna slow it down a little bit.

89
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,760
I am.

90
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,120
I'm gonna do something more modern.

91
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,120
Super modern.

92
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,280
It was written this year.

93
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,280
And this is a piece of my own.

94
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:32,200
So I'm currently composing a soundtrack for a VR game called Straylight.

95
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,440
And I'm on the development team.

96
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,360
And we have been working for almost two years on this game.

97
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,560
And it is a lot of fun.

98
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,440
It's currently in early access.

99
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,760
And I'm very proud to be part of it.

100
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,720
It is a kind of game where you're in this cosmic world.

101
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
You're in space.

102
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,080
We have a gun called a Straylight gun that connects to different floating objects.

103
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,960
And you get to fling yourself and float through space and try to basically get through this

104
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,120
obstacle course.

105
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,600
And all the worlds are visually very kind of weird and different.

106
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,640
And I've gotten to compose the music.

107
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,680
And it's basically my synth prog rock odyssey is what I'm doing for the music.

108
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,120
So it's very fun.

109
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,440
And I'm very proud of the game.

110
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,280
So if you have VR, go check it out.

111
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,440
It's called Straylight.

112
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
And I know one of my...

113
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,640
I think one of my team members is in the chat.

114
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,040
Shoutout to Dan if you're in the chat.

115
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,160
I don't think you've ever heard me play this, Dan.

116
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,200
But I'm gonna do...

117
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,240
This is currently the second level from Straylight.

118
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:44,040
So that's it.

119
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,040
That's the sound...

120
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,240
One of the songs from the game, Straylight.

121
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,880
It's personally much cooler with all the synth sounds.

122
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,880
But it does work on the piano.

123
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Back to...

124
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,520
I think we're gonna go back to some 8-bit stuff.

125
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Yes.

126
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,520
So I got to play...

127
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,520
How am I doing on time?

128
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,520
I've got plenty of time.

129
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,520
All right.

130
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Short little story.

131
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,280
I got to play MAGFest 2019.

132
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,280
First MAGFest I ever went to.

133
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,280
Blew my mind.

134
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,280
It was amazing.

135
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,920
I kind of just started the 8-bit project.

136
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:22,080
And started playing and performing and making videos of NES soundtracks.

137
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,040
And I was working on some Mega Man 2 music.

138
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,960
I knew the composer, Takashi Tateishi, was gonna be there.

139
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,440
And I was like, oh, man.

140
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,400
What if he gets to hear my music?

141
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,400
My concert?

142
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,440
That would be so cool.

143
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,440
So I reached out to him, just to at least let him know that, hey, I'm gonna play some

144
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,160
of your music at MAGFest.

145
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,560
This is like Facebook Messenger.

146
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,840
So who knows if he even would get it.

147
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,480
But the whole event was awesome.

148
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,040
Earlier in the day, too, I saw his panel.

149
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:56,520
And you talked about his career and how he wrote that music.

150
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,040
And somebody asked him, what's your favorite piece?

151
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,960
What piece are you most proud of?

152
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,120
And he said, the ending theme from Mega Man 2.

153
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,200
Which is a really unique video game music piece, especially in that era.

154
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,800
It's very slow.

155
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:16,040
It's like a slow ballad, kind of somber song at the end of Mega Man 2.

156
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
It's very emotional.

157
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,920
And it's kind of rare for NES games.

158
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,440
He said that was his favorite one.

159
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:26,120
So anyway, I saw my concert.

160
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:32,120
I don't see him in the audience or anything, so I played through the Mega Man 2 music.

161
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,080
And I get to the ending theme, and I remember thinking, man, I really hope someday that

162
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,680
he could hear my arrangement of it.

163
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,760
I think he would really appreciate it if he moved.

164
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,120
After I played, it was a big open atrium.

165
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:51,240
So I said, thank you, Takashi Tateishi, if you're out there anywhere.

166
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,360
Thank you for such wonderful music.

167
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,840
And then the audience was like, he's right here, he's right here.

168
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,240
And he was in the audience the whole time, filming, taking pictures, taking pictures

169
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,240
with the audience.

170
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
He came up and gave me a big hug.

171
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,360
It was just such a surreal moment.

172
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,480
And I love telling that story.

173
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:13,280
To think that I can meet the composer from this video game that I used to play as a kid,

174
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,520
and I didn't even understand that a person made that music.

175
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,040
It was super cool.

176
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,520
So now I'm going to share with you some of the highlights from the soundtrack for Mega

177
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,520
Man 2.

178
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,720
We have the opening, the ending, and then the three boss themes.

179
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:35,520
We got Metal Man, Heat Man, and Air Man.

180
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,480

181
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,520

Alright, that was a little Mega Man 2.

271
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:23,560
Hope you enjoyed that.

272
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:28,560
This is just a personal note here.

273
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,560
This is going to be my last performance and my last day with this piano.

274
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:38,560
I recently bought a brand new Boston, Steinway made Boston piano.

275
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:43,560
Grand to replace this bald one here, which is a nice, fine instrument,

276
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:48,560
but it has its limitations. And just right now, the notes are starting to stick.

277
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,560
So, come on back up there, bud. So, with the humidity change that happens.

278
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:58,560
But I'm very excited. This has served me very well for a long time.

279
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,560
Very excited to get this new piano and to, yeah,

280
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:08,560
bring out all the detail that I'm trying to play.

281
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,560
I've got two more here, so not ending quite yet.

282
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,560
Just a fun little game too. Since I don't have any cool visuals,

283
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,560
I threw in a couple Nintendo paraphernalia in the background. Maybe you've noticed already.

284
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:28,560
But there are four.

285
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:33,560
If you haven't found them yet,

286
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:38,560
you have about 15 minutes to find them.

287
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,560
This is one of my favorite mugs.

288
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:48,560
This Neon Cat mug here, which is a little hint on what I'm going to play next.

289
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,560
So, this isn't quite video game music. This is video game music adjacent. You can think of it that way.

290
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:58,560
I'm going to do the Neon Cat theme.

291
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:03,560
Originally written by Dannywell P.

292
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:08,560
And then made famous through the YouTube video Neon Cat.

293
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,560
I just love the song, and it's fun, and I'm going to play it for you all tonight.
