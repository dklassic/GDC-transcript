1
00:00:03,983 --> 00:00:04,884
So I think I'm going to start.

2
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:12,670
So just before I start, I'm just going to focus.

3
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:15,773
This talk is not going to focus on any technical aspects

4
00:00:15,873 --> 00:00:17,194
of making the art of The Witness.

5
00:00:18,034 --> 00:00:19,656
I'm going to try to show you the journey that we

6
00:00:19,696 --> 00:00:21,677
went through to figure out the art style

7
00:00:22,017 --> 00:00:23,959
and why we ended up doing certain decisions.

8
00:00:30,444 --> 00:00:31,465
So a bit about myself.

9
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,274
My name is Luis Antonio. I was born in Lisbon, Portugal,

10
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:38,677
and I've been working in the industry for over nine years as a 3D artist.

11
00:00:39,797 --> 00:00:43,279
I studied at Rockstar Games in London as an environment and character artist.

12
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,563
I worked on games like Manhunt 2, Midnight Club LA, on Max Payne, before I left.

13
00:00:50,123 --> 00:00:55,767
And then I moved to Quebec City, and I joined Ubisoft as a lead artist and eventually art director.

14
00:00:57,268 --> 00:01:01,250
I worked on games like Dance on Broadway, Power Up Heroes, I'm sure you've never heard about them.

15
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:05,064
and other titles that are not really worth mentioning.

16
00:01:06,324 --> 00:01:09,166
Tired of these creative constraints of commercial titles,

17
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:10,827
I tried to turn to video development.

18
00:01:11,087 --> 00:01:12,948
Thanks to Chris Hecker, I ended up in contact

19
00:01:12,968 --> 00:01:14,689
with Jonathan Blow, and I joined his team

20
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:16,510
here in San Francisco to work on The Witness.

21
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:21,953
We're a small independent studio called TechLink,

22
00:01:22,113 --> 00:01:23,154
led by Jonathan Blow.

23
00:01:24,054 --> 00:01:26,035
He's the driving force behind all projects

24
00:01:26,195 --> 00:01:27,796
and can be seen as the creative director,

25
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:28,857
producer, or designer.

26
00:01:29,697 --> 00:01:31,438
He designs the game and implements it.

27
00:01:32,533 --> 00:01:40,297
Currently the studio is composed of three programmers, four artists, and other collaborators that come in and out as we need.

28
00:01:41,158 --> 00:01:45,980
There are no titles or leads. Everyone is responsible for their own work and their own schedule.

29
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:50,643
It's a very organic and empowering environment which helps to develop great artwork.

30
00:01:53,184 --> 00:01:58,047
Also for this project we collaborated with architects and landscape architect studios.

31
00:01:58,607 --> 00:02:00,348
This will make sense later in the presentation.

32
00:02:01,217 --> 00:02:03,941
And I want to say thank you to the team that helped me prepare this talk.

33
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:05,442
I hope you guys enjoyed.

34
00:02:05,462 --> 00:02:12,110
So this is the trailer that we made for the PlayStation for announcement of the game,

35
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:13,973
for those who don't know about it.

36
00:02:14,653 --> 00:02:16,556
There's some audio. I hope it's on.

37
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:34,776
This video is a derivative work of the Touhou Project.

38
00:02:34,796 --> 00:02:38,182
Any resemblance to a person, living or dead, is coincidental.

39
00:02:38,222 --> 00:02:38,783
I'm not a human.

40
00:02:38,803 --> 00:02:39,324
I'm a ghost.

41
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:39,624
I'm a ghost.

42
00:02:39,644 --> 00:02:40,466
I'm a ghost.

43
00:02:40,486 --> 00:02:40,827
I'm a ghost.

44
00:02:40,907 --> 00:02:41,227
I'm a ghost.

45
00:02:41,247 --> 00:02:41,568
I'm a ghost.

46
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:41,909
I'm a ghost.

47
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:42,289
I'm a ghost.

48
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:42,610
I'm a ghost.

49
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,211
I'm a ghost.

50
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:43,471
I'm a ghost.

51
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:51,283
Though it's always much faster

52
00:02:51,323 --> 00:02:53,464
than a signal.

53
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:12,448
Do you think this is a game?

54
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:13,249
Yes, it is.

55
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:16,234
It's a game.

56
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:17,556
It's a game.

57
00:03:18,597 --> 00:03:19,439
It's a game.

58
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:19,819
It's a game.

59
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:20,340
It's a game.

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,582
It's a game.

61
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:11,207
So, what is The Witness?

62
00:04:11,287 --> 00:04:15,470
It's a first-person puzzle adventure game in an uninhabited island.

63
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:20,717
The island is divided into areas and each one has its own theme, kind of like Disneyland.

64
00:04:22,498 --> 00:04:23,018
In a good way.

65
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:27,539
Each area has a set of puzzles that unlocks a laser that allows you to access the final

66
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,760
area and complete the game.

67
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,061
The player is free to explore any part of the island at any time.

68
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:37,863
And apart from audio recordings that are scattered throughout the island, nothing is explained

69
00:04:37,883 --> 00:04:38,403
to the player.

70
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:42,884
So it's up to the player to find meaning through exploration and experimentation.

71
00:04:43,465 --> 00:04:45,625
There is no soundtrack, only environmental audio.

72
00:04:49,718 --> 00:04:53,641
So Jonathan had clear goals for what the art style should be,

73
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,382
and I'm going to try to cover them here.

74
00:04:56,403 --> 00:04:59,785
So what he wanted was to minimize the amount of noise we put into the player's mind.

75
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:05,209
Since the visuals are the primary channel of how information gets into your mind from the game,

76
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:08,251
we have to be very careful that the things that grab your attention

77
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,712
are the things that are most meaningful.

78
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:11,753
Otherwise, it will be very mentally noisy.

79
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:16,096
The art has to support and extend the gameplay principles.

80
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:20,151
So we need to use the art to guide the player and teach him the rules of the world.

81
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:23,174
Like, can I walk here? Is this object relevant to gameplay?

82
00:05:23,194 --> 00:05:27,337
It has to be easy for the player to navigate and orient himself all the time.

83
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:31,200
And finally, the island has to be based in the real world.

84
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:35,424
It has to be grounded in real world rules for gameplay purposes.

85
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:39,087
It has to have realistic lighting, shadows, audio, and physics.

86
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:43,390
And it has to be a logical reasoning for how and why the island is laid out.

87
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:46,153
Like, why is this building here? What was its function?

88
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:49,854
So this was the state of the game

89
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:52,435
before we started to focus on the art style.

90
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:56,057
Similar to Braid, the art team was brought in

91
00:05:56,117 --> 00:05:57,618
when the core of the game was complete,

92
00:05:58,198 --> 00:06:00,179
and about 90% of the puzzles were done.

93
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,841
You could sit down and play the game

94
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:04,182
from start to a rough ending.

95
00:06:05,382 --> 00:06:06,823
There was a rough layout of the island,

96
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:09,024
and the themes of each area were clearly defined.

97
00:06:09,905 --> 00:06:11,766
You could experience what the game was about,

98
00:06:11,866 --> 00:06:14,047
and understand the concepts and ideas behind it.

99
00:06:18,513 --> 00:06:20,855
So looking at the island with this level of completion

100
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:22,756
allowed us to understand what to look for

101
00:06:22,896 --> 00:06:24,657
and start the process of finding the art style.

102
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:27,679
We broke this down in a couple of steps.

103
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:30,061
So the first one was research and inspirations.

104
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:34,083
How did other art forms approach this attempt at simplifying reality?

105
00:06:34,183 --> 00:06:36,925
Movies, paintings, photography, commercials, video games?

106
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:38,866
And how did they solve these challenges?

107
00:06:40,227 --> 00:06:41,288
The other one is inspiration.

108
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:42,808
What did we like in our research?

109
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,349
What do we feel that it worked?

110
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,671
And what connects with the art team and inspires?

111
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,094
Then we'll define our art guidelines and key challenges.

112
00:06:52,734 --> 00:06:54,235
What did we learn from the research?

113
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:58,436
And how can we use these principles on The Witness?

114
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:01,338
And then we implement and iterate.

115
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:03,058
We apply the principles to the island.

116
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:05,239
We iterate until we're satisfied with the results.

117
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,240
We try not to think about technical constraints.

118
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:10,721
And we try not to forget the original goal,

119
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:14,223
since things will get diluted through iteration.

120
00:07:16,204 --> 00:07:17,064
So for our research.

121
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,343
We decided to learn how other artists managed to simplify reality and ask ourselves some questions.

122
00:07:23,404 --> 00:07:25,725
Like, how much texture do you need to define a material?

123
00:07:26,986 --> 00:07:30,888
You can define a shape using only the outlines. In this example, the rooftop, the chimney,

124
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:35,531
the windows, and it's enough to convey the idea of a house. Do you need any other detail?

125
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:43,256
And how much information can you get with shapes? Can we get rid of texture completely?

126
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:48,675
And what about using the noise to create contrast between different elements?

127
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:51,076
In this example, organic versus man-made.

128
00:07:53,898 --> 00:07:56,839
We also look at other mediums and how they approach this simplification

129
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:58,500
and the ones that were successful,

130
00:07:59,321 --> 00:08:00,261
which raised the question,

131
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:02,482
are we going for something realistic or stylized?

132
00:08:02,522 --> 00:08:03,383
And what does that mean?

133
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:06,425
So a game like Mirror's Edge, in this example,

134
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:07,845
stays on the realistic side.

135
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,207
The amount of detail on objects, as well as the texture noise,

136
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:12,108
matches reality.

137
00:08:12,815 --> 00:08:15,337
But the use of color and saturation is exaggerated

138
00:08:15,517 --> 00:08:17,739
and used very well to convey key gameplay elements.

139
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,841
There is also a cleanliness of the environments.

140
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:22,242
There's no dirt or grime,

141
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:25,424
and it creates a very appealing, attractive final result.

142
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:28,026
In a way, they successfully simplified

143
00:08:28,066 --> 00:08:30,247
and distorted reality for the gameplay purposes.

144
00:08:32,749 --> 00:08:34,690
Other games, like Journey or Team Fortress,

145
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:36,872
allowed us to see how simple you can go

146
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,373
with very little texture and geometry.

147
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:42,017
Since the geometry and texture are so simplified,

148
00:08:42,257 --> 00:08:45,659
there is a bigger responsibility in how you use them to convey information.

149
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,862
Color becomes more relevant in showing the importance between different elements,

150
00:08:50,482 --> 00:08:52,383
and there is a stronger element of stylization.

151
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:57,846
So this is an example of a TV commercial,

152
00:08:57,986 --> 00:08:59,927
and you can see they stylized the environment a lot

153
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:02,268
in order to make it more captivating and dynamic,

154
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:03,429
and this is something we liked.

155
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,880
But it made us wonder, is this something we should do,

156
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,140
and why should we do it?

157
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,761
Does the gameplay benefit from this stylization?

158
00:09:12,321 --> 00:09:14,362
So we know that the player knowledge of the real world,

159
00:09:14,502 --> 00:09:16,442
how light and shadow works, is very important.

160
00:09:17,482 --> 00:09:19,883
So this means if we're going to distort reality,

161
00:09:19,943 --> 00:09:21,703
we need to have a good reason to do so.

162
00:09:25,184 --> 00:09:26,564
And raises the question, how can we

163
00:09:26,604 --> 00:09:28,984
be expressive if we're simplifying reality,

164
00:09:29,024 --> 00:09:30,445
but we don't want to stylize it?

165
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:35,141
So by looking at landscape painters, we realize they're doing this all the time.

166
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:39,303
In plein air painting, artists are always looking for ways to cheat

167
00:09:39,764 --> 00:09:42,405
in the way they represent reality while keeping it realistic.

168
00:09:43,726 --> 00:09:47,528
They won't paint every single leaf in a tree, but when you look at it, the idea is there.

169
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:51,631
They're also extremely good at understanding what to simplify,

170
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:54,573
and I feel that is one of the things that took us longer to understand.

171
00:09:58,493 --> 00:10:03,754
So this made us realize that we can be expressive and stylized reality if we use it to emphasize

172
00:10:03,794 --> 00:10:05,615
the properties of what we're representing.

173
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:11,117
We don't need to show every single branch on a tree, but if we convey the proportions

174
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:14,237
and thickness of the trunk and its shape, you will understand what it is.

175
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:17,498
We don't need to model every single leaf, but to show its properties.

176
00:10:17,638 --> 00:10:18,859
Are they fluffy, thin?

177
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:21,179
Is it a young tree or an old one?

178
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,102
And this leads to another area, the collaboration with the landscape and architect studios.

179
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:32,747
So when I joined, I found this pretty weird, like,

180
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:34,488
why don't we get concept artists?

181
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:36,729
How much can these guys bring to the project?

182
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:38,991
And they don't have any video game development background.

183
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:40,912
Well, I couldn't be more wrong.

184
00:10:43,013 --> 00:10:46,395
So this is how the island looked when they joined.

185
00:10:46,795 --> 00:10:49,157
There were basic ideas for a mountain, a desert,

186
00:10:49,397 --> 00:10:51,298
there's a castle, a windmill on the background.

187
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,760
Apart from that, everything was open to change.

188
00:10:55,641 --> 00:10:57,281
And this is where their knowledge made a difference.

189
00:10:58,054 --> 00:11:01,316
Architects and landscape architects, they deal with the real world.

190
00:11:02,436 --> 00:11:05,378
They're limited by the physicality of the place they have to work on,

191
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,959
budget constraints, client's objectives, and the purpose of the structure.

192
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,422
We didn't have any of these limitations, so they had to create them.

193
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:19,444
They tried to understand, if this island was to exist in the real world,

194
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:20,825
how would it come to be?

195
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:24,987
Would the mountain probably originate from a volcano?

196
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:27,342
What is the wet and the dry side?

197
00:11:27,602 --> 00:11:28,783
What are the different biomes?

198
00:11:28,883 --> 00:11:30,564
And what is the relationship between them?

199
00:11:34,086 --> 00:11:36,208
Throughout this process, they also define the narrative

200
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:38,409
for the civilizations that occupy the island.

201
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:40,771
What were their philosophies and religions?

202
00:11:41,331 --> 00:11:43,532
And how do those affect their building methodologies?

203
00:11:46,054 --> 00:11:47,095
And how do these people adapt

204
00:11:47,115 --> 00:11:48,135
to the environment they live in?

205
00:11:48,987 --> 00:11:52,109
They created a rich relationship between nature and architecture.

206
00:11:52,349 --> 00:11:55,952
They were able to design time through the island, providing a conceptual history for

207
00:11:55,992 --> 00:11:56,712
the whole project.

208
00:11:57,993 --> 00:12:02,196
So this is a localized example, where you can see the relationship between the environment

209
00:12:02,236 --> 00:12:04,617
and the architecture, and how they influence each other.

210
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:10,021
On the Civilization 1 image, you can see early civilization quarry mining, and there was

211
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:11,221
just manual stone cutting.

212
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:14,623
Then on Civilization 2, they used more adventure manual tools.

213
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:18,326
They used stone to build churches, temples, and other structures.

214
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:22,256
And on the final image, it's an industrial-scale production.

215
00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:23,977
They use stones to create concrete,

216
00:12:24,638 --> 00:12:26,300
and they use that concrete to create factories,

217
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,122
like the one on the image, and other more modern structures.

218
00:12:29,943 --> 00:12:31,465
And this is how it looks in the game.

219
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,532
So this is a tower in the game and how it looked at the start.

220
00:12:40,513 --> 00:12:42,315
With this rich narrative, it allowed us

221
00:12:42,335 --> 00:12:43,776
to find answers to our questions.

222
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:46,328
What are the materials to build the structure?

223
00:12:46,388 --> 00:12:47,108
Where do we get them?

224
00:12:47,228 --> 00:12:48,448
How do we carry these materials?

225
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:49,888
And what is the function of the building?

226
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:53,429
The architects now had the answers to these questions.

227
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:58,750
And using them along time, Jonathan's gameplay limitations, the relationship of the buildings

228
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:02,931
with the landscape, and the availability of the island raw materials, they could figure

229
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,011
out how the buildings would look.

230
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:09,993
Also this grounding and logic.

231
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,790
Finally allowed us to define the art style.

232
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,851
Now we knew what features we wanted to keep,

233
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:16,371
what we wanted to simplify,

234
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:18,912
and if we're stylizing, why we should do so.

235
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,273
So these are the guidelines that we came up with.

236
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:24,934
The first one was it would be a simplified reality.

237
00:13:25,595 --> 00:13:26,875
It's not a cartoon style,

238
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:29,236
but a simplified representation of reality.

239
00:13:30,036 --> 00:13:31,957
We convey only the core characteristics

240
00:13:32,057 --> 00:13:33,137
of what is being displayed,

241
00:13:33,637 --> 00:13:35,858
and we remove everything else that is not relevant.

242
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:39,400
It has to be pleasant and harmonious.

243
00:13:40,848 --> 00:13:44,051
So there has to be a constant and clear navigation, orientation, and landmarks,

244
00:13:44,932 --> 00:13:49,355
distinct areas and color fields, and a clear relationship between elements and the hierarchy,

245
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:52,457
like the paths, the panels, and the environment background.

246
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,802
And the art has to be an extension of the gameplay and the core game design.

247
00:13:59,343 --> 00:14:02,125
The art cannot contradict what the gameplay is trying to achieve.

248
00:14:02,645 --> 00:14:04,987
The heart has to support and extend the gameplay.

249
00:14:05,407 --> 00:14:07,529
And ideally, the art will be part of the gameplay.

250
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:14,188
So with these guidelines in mind, we started to apply them to the most important elements

251
00:14:14,248 --> 00:14:14,768
on the island.

252
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:17,831
The man-made structures, rock formations, and the vegetation.

253
00:14:20,274 --> 00:14:26,881
So starting with buildings, we tried to look at how could we reduce reality.

254
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:32,086
So we picked up a photo of an old castle and we tried to see what we accentuate and what

255
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:32,987
are we going to reduce.

256
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:38,773
So the tower from before, this is the first implementation

257
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,254
after we got the design from the architects.

258
00:14:42,335 --> 00:14:44,656
So we took a screenshot and we tried to analyze the results.

259
00:14:45,396 --> 00:14:47,517
The sky felt too noisy and distracted

260
00:14:47,557 --> 00:14:48,418
for the building shape.

261
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:51,759
There was unnecessary brick noise and grime.

262
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,500
It didn't bring any extra information.

263
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,721
The geometry is not working with the texture detail.

264
00:14:56,841 --> 00:14:58,962
You can see on that broken corner on the side there.

265
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:02,924
And the light is accentuating how flat the geometry is.

266
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:05,545
You can see that the tower edge is extremely sharp.

267
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,868
So we took the same screenshot, we painted the texture map,

268
00:15:11,108 --> 00:15:13,569
we tried to get, we tried to think like,

269
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:15,270
how can we convey a brick wall?

270
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,030
So we minimized the amount of colors

271
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,191
to show that it's a brick wall

272
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,292
by just showing the rectangles that form the bricks.

273
00:15:21,812 --> 00:15:23,872
We took out the clouds to let the silhouette read,

274
00:15:24,433 --> 00:15:26,293
and we tried to add details where it matters

275
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,814
to convey the properties of stone,

276
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,034
in the corners, in the broken wall,

277
00:15:30,615 --> 00:15:32,755
and the brick highlights on the silhouette.

278
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:38,029
We took a similar approach for the rock formations.

279
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:40,710
We looked at reality and we tried to understand,

280
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:43,252
what are the key elements that define these shapes?

281
00:15:44,973 --> 00:15:46,254
We started with a photo reference,

282
00:15:46,334 --> 00:15:48,075
and we used some filters to remove noise.

283
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:50,296
And we started to understand these elements.

284
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:52,657
Then we tried to apply them to a sculpture

285
00:15:52,878 --> 00:15:53,818
and see how that would read.

286
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,100
So we were happy with the results.

287
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,422
So we built a test scene with these rocks

288
00:15:59,522 --> 00:16:01,463
and see how it feels to walk in this environment.

289
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:04,305
Seeing things in context makes a big difference

290
00:16:04,325 --> 00:16:05,465
rather than isolated tests.

291
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:07,728
We were happy with the results.

292
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:11,991
There was still enough detail to understand the material, and it was simplified enough

293
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:13,071
not to be distracting.

294
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:16,334
Here are some more examples.

295
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:17,394
There are some basalt rocks.

296
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:20,997
This is a rocky desert cliffside.

297
00:16:22,918 --> 00:16:24,699
And this is the quarry that I showed previously.

298
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:29,542
So the final element was vegetation.

299
00:16:29,702 --> 00:16:30,783
This was a different challenge.

300
00:16:31,423 --> 00:16:35,486
Unlike the buildings, reducing the noise of foliage was not that straightforward.

301
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:39,466
The landscape artists gave us plenty of reference,

302
00:16:39,606 --> 00:16:41,747
but our initial attempts never felt right.

303
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:46,129
Everything would come out too noisy or too realistic.

304
00:16:46,449 --> 00:16:48,290
The vegetation would feel fat and boring.

305
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,191
And any time we mixed different types of foliage,

306
00:16:51,371 --> 00:16:54,052
it would come out a mess, like you can see on the bottom left example.

307
00:16:55,092 --> 00:16:56,373
Very noisy and boring.

308
00:16:58,414 --> 00:17:01,675
So we took a step back and we tried to understand the nature of vegetation.

309
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:05,116
We looked back at our references and tried to see what we liked.

310
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,216
These are some classical anime backgrounds,

311
00:17:09,156 --> 00:17:11,918
and they all have a realism and simplicity at the same time.

312
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:14,660
The foreground vegetation is very detailed,

313
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,502
but the background blends really nicely.

314
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:19,764
It has a volume and shape without getting lost in detail.

315
00:17:21,265 --> 00:17:23,287
So this made us wonder, what if we

316
00:17:23,347 --> 00:17:25,949
try to represent a type or a certain feeling

317
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,131
rather than a specific kind of bush or tree?

318
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:30,773
And what if we apply these principles

319
00:17:30,993 --> 00:17:32,934
of the painted backdrops to our art style?

320
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:35,756
So.

321
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:39,462
Awesome work from the programmers, some technical tweaks on the art side,

322
00:17:39,943 --> 00:17:41,445
and we achieved what we were looking for.

323
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:45,609
We simplified the trunks and silhouettes to get the core properties of the tree,

324
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,213
and we created the impression of leaves without drawing them individually.

325
00:17:50,574 --> 00:17:52,656
Also, we didn't just find these results.

326
00:17:53,297 --> 00:17:57,401
We had tons of failed attempts, but each one got us closer to our ideal final result.

327
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:03,339
And I think having a clear goal in mind, rather than accepting the results that we got from our technical knowledge,

328
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:06,660
allowed us to achieve a look that hopefully will make this game feel unique.

329
00:18:08,981 --> 00:18:10,781
Here's another area, how it looked before and after.

330
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:20,964
So, as we apply destillization, the importance of landscape reference becomes really big.

331
00:18:22,695 --> 00:18:25,797
This is an image of a natural layering on a tropical rainforest.

332
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:29,959
Since we're only representing the essential detail, it means that if you make the wrong

333
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:33,201
choices, things will very quickly look plastic and artificial.

334
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:37,324
And landscape gave us valuable understanding of the relationship between the different

335
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:40,346
elements and made sure we understood the references we were using.

336
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,828
And this is an example that I would like to show.

337
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:49,172
So on this, the palm trees on this image, in our first version, we didn't have any dry

338
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:49,852
hanging leaves.

339
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:53,383
Because we didn't know, you know, in the wild there is no one to cut them.

340
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,325
And we forgot about that.

341
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:56,706
And it adds a lot to it.

342
00:18:59,468 --> 00:19:02,370
So, with all these elements, we could now apply them to the game design.

343
00:19:03,671 --> 00:19:07,434
This is an area very early in the game when the player has freedom of movement for the first time.

344
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:10,917
So our goal here was to guide the player as much as possible.

345
00:19:12,178 --> 00:19:17,162
So we made the path brighter in order to make it clear where to go without getting lost,

346
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:18,883
even though you can leave it at any time.

347
00:19:20,073 --> 00:19:21,935
We got the bushes to fade into the background,

348
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,478
and if you look closely, you can see a red bush further ahead

349
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:28,380
that unconsciously will drive the player towards that location.

350
00:19:30,843 --> 00:19:32,644
Another important thing were the landmarks.

351
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:35,947
This is a view from the highest point on the mountain.

352
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:39,270
In the original version, besides being lower,

353
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,852
the landmarks were not that distinct.

354
00:19:41,332 --> 00:19:43,994
The building shapes would help, but the landscape was very bland.

355
00:19:45,736 --> 00:19:46,917
So using our art guidelines...

356
00:19:48,047 --> 00:19:51,350
We made sure that each area has its own distinct vibe and color palette,

357
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,412
and we used stronger shapes to help create memorable landmarks.

358
00:19:57,454 --> 00:20:04,479
Finally, another part of our iteration process would be to revisit areas that we considered very close to finish after some time had passed.

359
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:08,702
We could look at it with fresh eyes and understand what needed to be improved.

360
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:13,615
So this is an example where the most important thing is the gate and the panel.

361
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:15,997
They have to stand out since they're the most important elements.

362
00:20:16,378 --> 00:20:20,040
But the trees on the back and the vegetation are calling attention to themselves.

363
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,904
So with a quick paint-over, we were able to test some of the ideas

364
00:20:25,205 --> 00:20:26,546
and see how we could improve the results.

365
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:28,607
We changed the brightness of the different elements

366
00:20:29,148 --> 00:20:31,069
so the important structures pop out more.

367
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,452
We also changed the panel color so it stands out more to the player.

368
00:20:36,613 --> 00:20:38,115
This is another more subtle example.

369
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:40,451
So here are the walls and the pillars.

370
00:20:40,511 --> 00:20:41,952
We already went through our art style.

371
00:20:42,812 --> 00:20:43,992
And even though they're simplified,

372
00:20:44,012 --> 00:20:44,993
they felt very noisy.

373
00:20:45,153 --> 00:20:47,013
That white box is like temporary art.

374
00:20:47,153 --> 00:20:48,213
Don't pay attention to it.

375
00:20:49,454 --> 00:20:51,174
So we realized, I'm going to show you,

376
00:20:51,214 --> 00:20:54,395
we could remove all the noise from the pillars flat surface

377
00:20:54,495 --> 00:20:57,076
and use only the silhouette to represent the stone properties.

378
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,676
I'm going to show you the old image.

379
00:21:00,277 --> 00:21:03,298
The room still read the same, but with a much cleaner result.

380
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:08,379
So these are the conclusions we arrived at.

381
00:21:09,506 --> 00:21:11,247
Don't think about technical limitations.

382
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:13,930
Always think about what you want to achieve,

383
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,611
then find out how to achieve it.

384
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:18,493
You might end up having to cut down on your vision,

385
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:20,395
but you do it as late as possible

386
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:22,236
so it stays as good as it possibly can.

387
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:25,859
Always be aware of the big picture.

388
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,821
So several times we got lost in our goals.

389
00:21:29,061 --> 00:21:31,083
Something would look amazing, and we wanted to keep it

390
00:21:31,263 --> 00:21:33,144
even if it didn't bring anything to the table.

391
00:21:33,945 --> 00:21:36,087
Or we would just get lost in very small details.

392
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:38,909
Having someone that carries a strong vision...

393
00:21:39,582 --> 00:21:40,522
Makes all the difference.

394
00:21:42,863 --> 00:21:46,164
And finally, have a reason for everything you do, or most of it.

395
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:51,006
So artists often don't think about what they're doing, or they don't ask why they're doing it.

396
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:56,068
They decide on a certain direction, and they make decisions without looking back to see if they're justified.

397
00:21:57,389 --> 00:22:00,290
So just like in a painting where every single brush stroke counts,

398
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:04,712
every single rock, plant, or polygon that we place needs to have a reason to exist.

399
00:22:07,053 --> 00:22:07,593
And that's it.

400
00:22:09,613 --> 00:22:11,912
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
