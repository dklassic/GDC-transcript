00:00:06,068 --> 00:00:12,293
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:12,853 --> 00:00:14,314
Thanks everyone for attending.

3
00:00:14,934 --> 00:00:21,819
My name is Piers Harding-Rolls and I work as a games industry analyst at Ampere Analysis.

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,485
So the topic for today's talk is the games content subscription market, and I'll be examining

5
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,046
the market opportunity.

6
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:37,727
competitive catalog landscape and delving into some of the characteristics of the subscription

7
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:38,188
gamer.

8
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,234
So I think first off I think it's worthwhile just setting the scene of where I think we

9
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:53,858
are as a kind of industry in terms of its development and the kind of disruptive wave

10
00:00:53,878 --> 00:01:00,623
that we're going through at the moment. It's a kind of long development cycle I would say.

11
00:01:01,752 --> 00:01:09,335
We started off with various stages through which have been developed through the connectivity of

12
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:17,519
different device categories and they've allowed different business models to emerge. And we're

13
00:01:17,559 --> 00:01:24,302
now in this I think final stage, the sort of culmination of all this development heading

14
00:01:24,342 --> 00:01:28,003
towards what I would describe as a kind of on-demand consumption model.

15
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:33,907
And I guess the definition of that is giving players access

16
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:37,390
to content across all device categories

17
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,851
when and where they want it.

18
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:43,875
And the idea is to deliver content or games

19
00:01:43,935 --> 00:01:47,037
to the broadest audience in the most efficient way.

20
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:52,262
And if we think about that kind of consumption,

21
00:01:52,302 --> 00:01:54,804
we're thinking about a form of consumption

22
00:01:54,844 --> 00:01:58,046
which fits well within the subscription monetization

23
00:01:58,086 --> 00:01:58,286
model.

24
00:02:01,983 --> 00:02:07,227
And I think that's driven the idea, this sort of catchphrase of the Netflix of games.

25
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:10,450
So it's been bandied around for quite a few years now.

26
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:16,635
And I think when people use it, it sort of immediately conjures up comparisons

27
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:19,297
with other entertainment sectors.

28
00:02:20,138 --> 00:02:25,382
At its most basic, it suggests access to a catalogue of content, of course.

29
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:28,925
And that's, you know, fairly straightforward in the context of some of the games

30
00:02:28,945 --> 00:02:29,845
description services.

31
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:32,586
obviously Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation Now.

32
00:02:34,307 --> 00:02:39,188
But it also indicates the kind of shift

33
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:43,328
that we've seen in other entertainment sectors.

34
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:45,369
So the way we've seen the video and the music sectors

35
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:49,149
develop a much more significant shift towards subscription

36
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:52,550
as the main monetization model for the industry.

37
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,231
And I think that, in turn, stokes a bit of fear

38
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:59,651
in the games studios and the developers

39
00:02:59,751 --> 00:02:59,971
that.

40
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:03,280
you know, potentially under that sort of model,

41
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,201
they will be progressively more squeezed,

42
00:03:05,962 --> 00:03:10,006
and the rules of monetization and engagement

43
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:13,168
start to shift from what we are used to now.

44
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:19,654
But actually, I think it's a pretty misleading analogy.

45
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:24,672
There are some similarities between the games sector

46
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:26,172
and these other entertainment sectors,

47
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,933
but the games sector is fundamentally different

48
00:03:30,013 --> 00:03:30,833
in many ways.

49
00:03:31,873 --> 00:03:36,514
As many of you sure know, most of the spending on games

50
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:38,775
is on in-game monetization,

51
00:03:39,715 --> 00:03:42,055
primarily in free-to-play titles.

52
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:46,136
So 79% of the total market opportunity in 2021

53
00:03:46,216 --> 00:03:47,697
in terms of consumer spending

54
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:49,937
was based on in-game monetization.

55
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:56,472
That means I think it's very unlikely that we're going to see a wholesale shift to subscription

56
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:57,332
monetization.

57
00:03:59,154 --> 00:04:04,979
Also in the context of subscription services, there is this ability to have hybrid monetization,

58
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:11,904
so in-game monetization combined with subscriptions, which means that the commercial framework

59
00:04:11,924 --> 00:04:18,310
for these services is very different from the framework for other entertainment subscription

60
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:18,810
services.

61
00:04:20,035 --> 00:04:26,999
And it's not just a case of replacing, say, the premium sales with subscription sales.

62
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,883
You know, you have this ability to monetize those subscription users in other ways as well.

63
00:04:33,763 --> 00:04:40,788
And that means a potentially higher ARPU in terms of, you know, higher ARPU ceiling in

64
00:04:40,828 --> 00:04:44,870
terms of the overall opportunity potentially compared to these other sectors.

65
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:49,210
The other difference is that there's not much exclusive content

66
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,632
which is available just for subscription services.

67
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:53,974
I mean, there's a few examples, I think, in Apple Arcade,

68
00:04:54,074 --> 00:04:58,418
but generally you can't, if you want to get access to a game

69
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,840
that was in a subscription service,

70
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,502
you can do that through other forms of monetization.

71
00:05:04,023 --> 00:05:05,704
So all the games in Game Pass, for example,

72
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:08,867
you can buy premium games outside of that.

73
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:13,171
And that means the commercial framework is different

74
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:20,048
game subscription services also means that drivers for content inclusion within the services

75
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:26,350
vary within the game space compared to the entertainment sector. And I think that is

76
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:31,012
reflected in the sort of deals that can be done. So the actual acquisition of content

77
00:05:31,072 --> 00:05:37,334
into those services from both the service provider side and from the devs, there is

78
00:05:37,694 --> 00:05:42,336
a good deal of flexibility in the types of deals that can be done, I think.

79
00:05:48,003 --> 00:05:53,226
So if we look at the key drivers for adding games

80
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:54,867
to subscription services,

81
00:05:54,947 --> 00:05:56,568
obviously we have the direct revenue.

82
00:05:58,369 --> 00:06:00,310
And I think there's, you know,

83
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,271
a lot could be said about the different deals

84
00:06:02,311 --> 00:06:05,533
that can be done with different platforms and services.

85
00:06:05,553 --> 00:06:07,334
There's a lot of variation there.

86
00:06:07,354 --> 00:06:08,995
It depends on, you know,

87
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:10,876
what the service provider is trying to get out of it.

88
00:06:11,984 --> 00:06:20,846
and the extent of the willingness to provide exclusivity from the content owner, for example,

89
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:28,148
and other factors such as, you know, whether it's a new launch or a new release. Obviously those,

90
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:36,971
I guess, more comprehensive deals offer a bigger revenue opportunity.

91
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:41,453
But for many game devs, I think that's a really tough decision to make.

92
00:06:41,553 --> 00:06:45,717
So, you know, the decision of putting your game, day and date,

93
00:06:45,877 --> 00:06:50,641
into a subscription service for an exclusive period of time,

94
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:53,544
it's tough to make a decision around that.

95
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:59,389
Is that a good commercially, for me, at this point in time?

96
00:07:00,408 --> 00:07:03,389
And I think as a result, many of the deals that are done

97
00:07:03,409 --> 00:07:05,750
are really for older titles, catalog titles.

98
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,651
They tend to be the deals that have been done.

99
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:13,953
The other drivers for adding content

100
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:15,554
to these subscription services include,

101
00:07:15,754 --> 00:07:17,614
you know, reestablishing a franchise.

102
00:07:17,934 --> 00:07:20,375
If you're bringing a new game in a particular franchise out.

103
00:07:21,934 --> 00:07:26,078
and putting an older title into a subscription service to raise the profile.

104
00:07:26,858 --> 00:07:30,942
There's the ability to reach a wider, a broader audience

105
00:07:32,523 --> 00:07:36,827
and potentially getting exposure to highly engaged gamers.

106
00:07:36,927 --> 00:07:42,231
So some of the stats that Microsoft has come out again with today,

107
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:43,813
you know, talking about.

108
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:48,318
gamers, subscription gamers, Xbox game pass gamers

109
00:07:48,358 --> 00:07:51,160
who are much more willing to spend on content, et cetera.

110
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:56,824
There's also this ability to boost visibility

111
00:07:57,464 --> 00:08:01,867
and do co-marketing with the service providers, essentially.

112
00:08:01,887 --> 00:08:05,509
And there's also a network effect to consider.

113
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:11,143
If you bring in a significant amount of users,

114
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:14,385
the network effects potentially on other platforms

115
00:08:14,565 --> 00:08:15,906
where your content is available

116
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:19,568
and the opportunity in terms of additional premium sales

117
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,349
might be boosted because of that.

118
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:30,608
So I talked a little bit about why you would put your content

119
00:08:30,668 --> 00:08:33,610
into these services and how games is different

120
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,731
from other entertainment subscription services.

121
00:08:37,411 --> 00:08:40,092
I also think it's worth just looking at the opportunities.

122
00:08:40,132 --> 00:08:44,134
So we've got it in perspective to understand, you know,

123
00:08:44,254 --> 00:08:47,536
how impactful it could be on the market.

124
00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:50,377
So this is the North America and European.

125
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:54,994
gains market total with the chunk that is relevant

126
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:57,176
to games content subscription services.

127
00:08:57,557 --> 00:09:00,259
It's only 4% of the market currently.

128
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,001
So I don't think we should, I guess,

129
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:06,124
overblow the idea of the Netflix of games

130
00:09:06,164 --> 00:09:10,148
in the context of the entire game sector.

131
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,291
And if we look at the forecast.

132
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:19,622
It's growing and it's going to continue to expand.

133
00:09:20,803 --> 00:09:22,403
But I also don't see that there's going

134
00:09:22,423 --> 00:09:24,444
to be this very dramatic shift

135
00:09:24,904 --> 00:09:27,025
across to subscription monetization.

136
00:09:27,605 --> 00:09:30,425
Because of those points I made earlier talking about the,

137
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:34,727
you know, the strength of in-game monetization,

138
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:38,328
for example, which takes a massive majority of the share

139
00:09:38,388 --> 00:09:40,368
of spending across the sector.

140
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:45,150
So this is.

141
00:09:46,155 --> 00:09:49,276
our estimates for market share for the leading services.

142
00:09:50,076 --> 00:09:52,737
Again, this is across Western spend,

143
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:58,918
across games content subscription services for Q4 2021.

144
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:02,779
And it's clear that Xbox Game Pass is in a dominant position.

145
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,460
And Microsoft has, you know,

146
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,881
been very active in terms of its acquisitions, and that is driving a kind of

147
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:19,375
concerned that its pipeline will be substantially boosted,

148
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:21,416
its first party pipeline, and what

149
00:10:21,436 --> 00:10:24,718
are the implications for third party companies

150
00:10:24,738 --> 00:10:27,900
that are putting their content into that particular service?

151
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,961
And this kind of dominant position

152
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:32,262
obviously exacerbates that situation.

153
00:10:33,963 --> 00:10:36,504
I think there will be some implications, potentially.

154
00:10:36,604 --> 00:10:40,366
So the more first party content, the bigger.

155
00:10:41,816 --> 00:10:47,720
franchises that it brings into the service, obviously I think squeezes those smaller titles

156
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:55,545
potentially, and if there's this significant shift towards games as a service titles, then again

157
00:10:55,565 --> 00:11:03,830
I think there's a potential for it to undermine the engagement available for smaller titles in

158
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:09,413
those services. I think we have to take it into context though, this is

159
00:11:11,482 --> 00:11:18,529
an impact which could be contained around the console opportunity, so the Xbox console

160
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:23,874
opportunity, and potentially have a knock-on impact on PlayStation to some degree.

161
00:11:25,695 --> 00:11:30,319
At the moment, I think it's less relevant to the PC space and obviously the mobile space.

162
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,346
In terms of the wider opportunity, I don't think this is a significant amount of concern.

163
00:11:42,395 --> 00:11:48,184
So the success of Xbox Game Pass has been driven primarily

164
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:52,471
by the inclusion of newer releases compared

165
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:53,192
to other services.

166
00:11:53,252 --> 00:11:56,898
Obviously, the sort of watershed moment was the introduction

167
00:11:57,018 --> 00:11:57,920
of their own.

168
00:11:58,822 --> 00:12:03,425
first party releases directly into the service, but there is a very strong correlation between

169
00:12:03,445 --> 00:12:08,688
the performance of Xbox Game Pass in terms of the number of subscribers it's picked up

170
00:12:09,288 --> 00:12:14,431
in the second half of last year and the number of day one titles that have come into that

171
00:12:15,512 --> 00:12:21,095
service, a sort of mixture of, so in blue here that's third party titles and orange

172
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:23,056
is first party titles.

173
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:29,028
And it's very hard to see other services competing

174
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:34,232
on this level of willingness to financially back the service

175
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:37,214
to bring in certainly first party titles.

176
00:12:37,234 --> 00:12:41,277
So Sony's upcoming kind of reformat

177
00:12:41,317 --> 00:12:42,798
of its subscription services,

178
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:45,940
I don't see them changing their policy

179
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,982
for first party content,

180
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:51,885
but potentially they may start to boost it

181
00:12:52,365 --> 00:12:54,366
in the context of third party new releases.

182
00:12:55,522 --> 00:13:01,245
But this is why Xbox Game Pass has been particularly successful.

183
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:10,971
So this is just to reinforce that idea.

184
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:13,832
This is PlayStation Now Age of Catalog

185
00:13:13,992 --> 00:13:17,314
and Xbox Game Pass Age of Catalog compared.

186
00:13:18,435 --> 00:13:22,077
And you can see that Xbox Game Pass is...

187
00:13:22,937 --> 00:13:27,599
much younger in terms of its catalog, it's got a lot more fresher content and newer content

188
00:13:27,739 --> 00:13:33,222
compared to PlayStation Now. Obviously the positioning is vastly different. The success

189
00:13:33,282 --> 00:13:39,006
of both of those platforms I think reflects the quality and the age of content that's in those

190
00:13:39,846 --> 00:13:40,786
different services.

191
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:49,908
And if we're thinking about how the Game Pass catalog is going to evolve,

192
00:13:50,228 --> 00:13:52,270
I've talked about that kind of watershed moment

193
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:57,134
where first party games were placed into that service.

194
00:13:57,714 --> 00:14:01,177
And then progressively we've seen third party content,

195
00:14:01,217 --> 00:14:05,040
which is high profile, basically catalog content,

196
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,323
which older titles, but high profile titles.

197
00:14:09,044 --> 00:14:10,425
And we're in this stage now where.

198
00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:18,100
third party games, day one release, are going into the service and the next stage is seeing

199
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,341
bigger franchises of those new releases going directly into the service. So that should

200
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:29,343
be, you know, we've already seen some interesting additions this year. I think it's just inevitable

201
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:31,563
that we will see some big franchises going in.

202
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:37,222
And I think the end game is this idea of cloud native games,

203
00:14:37,262 --> 00:14:39,924
and that's when we get some sort of exclusivity, I think,

204
00:14:40,024 --> 00:14:43,967
for the Game Pass proposition, obviously distributed

205
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:46,589
through xCloud within Game Pass Ultimate.

206
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,533
And I think that's the end game.

207
00:14:51,413 --> 00:14:53,575
It might not come this year, might not come next year,

208
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:55,056
but it's certainly something that's

209
00:14:56,197 --> 00:14:57,819
with the announcements today, for example,

210
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,361
with the idea of Azure and other factors.

211
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,640
This is definitely the kind of roadmap

212
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,100
which they're developing towards.

213
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:13,062
So we talked about the sort of main players in the market

214
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:17,063
and the usual suspects, but are there opportunities

215
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:19,844
for content owners outside of those?

216
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:23,245
So at the moment, there's a lot of activity

217
00:15:23,925 --> 00:15:27,366
of cloud gaming service providers in the telco space.

218
00:15:28,055 --> 00:15:32,238
who are served by white label aggregators and cloud gaming

219
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:35,240
technology companies.

220
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,002
And there's an opportunity there, I think,

221
00:15:39,062 --> 00:15:41,163
to license content into those services.

222
00:15:41,343 --> 00:15:43,445
Although it's not going to be a huge opportunity.

223
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:44,966
It's a sort of incremental opportunity.

224
00:15:46,006 --> 00:15:48,588
And I think there's a window of opportunity

225
00:15:48,688 --> 00:15:52,870
to do these kind of deals now, because the interest is really

226
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:53,311
high.

227
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:55,172
There's a lot of services that come to market.

228
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:56,893
There's a lot of competition between services.

229
00:15:57,464 --> 00:16:01,305
and they are wanting content, they're competing for content.

230
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:09,308
So there is an opportunity there. And then obviously we have other new entrants coming

231
00:16:09,348 --> 00:16:17,731
into the market. Netflix is the obvious big name which has announced its move into the market.

232
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:24,384
it's now securing content. I think it wants to secure, you know, a good batch of third-party

233
00:16:24,424 --> 00:16:28,847
content so it can build up the portfolio. Whether it can do that under the current terms that it's

234
00:16:28,907 --> 00:16:34,892
offering I think is perhaps questionable. I think it may need to revisit those terms to become more

235
00:16:34,932 --> 00:16:40,976
competitive with the existing players. So it's something to consider for them. But this, you

236
00:16:40,996 --> 00:16:45,800
know, Netflix's move might prompt other SVOD players to move into the market as well.

237
00:16:50,057 --> 00:16:52,299
So there are opportunities to pursue,

238
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:55,202
but I think it's also worth looking at how competitive

239
00:16:55,262 --> 00:16:57,124
the kind of catalog situation is

240
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:59,306
across the subscription services.

241
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:02,869
First up, you know, this is just a basic number.

242
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:05,752
This is the amount of distinct titles,

243
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:07,754
I think from December 2021,

244
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:12,478
number of distinct titles across all the services that we track.

245
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,501
And actually, it's not most services are.

246
00:17:16,177 --> 00:17:19,137
Pretty small, you know, there's less than 300 titles,

247
00:17:19,677 --> 00:17:21,018
many are less than 200 titles.

248
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:25,218
PlayStation now has a lot of legacy classic games in there

249
00:17:25,258 --> 00:17:28,899
that bulks out the catalog, but they are a kind of exception

250
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,360
at 900 titles.

251
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,701
And Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is around 500.

252
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,001
Xbox Game Pass PC is less.

253
00:17:38,821 --> 00:17:42,042
Xbox Game Pass console is, again, less.

254
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:45,063
But I think...

255
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,455
you have to sort of realize that actually there's not that much

256
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:53,941
uh... content in these services at the moment there's not a huge amount

257
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,203
and

258
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,631
I think you know competition to get your games into those services depending on

259
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:01,172
what they

260
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,536
the service providers want in terms of the level of,

261
00:18:05,097 --> 00:18:07,597
you know, maximum catalog that they hope to have.

262
00:18:08,238 --> 00:18:11,959
I think that's something that, you know,

263
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:14,600
obviously impacts the ability for you

264
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,481
to get your content into those services.

265
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,962
And if we think about, you know,

266
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:21,463
if they are expanding that much,

267
00:18:21,503 --> 00:18:24,484
this is the Xbox Game Pass ultimate volume

268
00:18:24,544 --> 00:18:27,225
of distinct titles, if we sort of define it,

269
00:18:28,005 --> 00:18:28,805
across the whole year.

270
00:18:28,825 --> 00:18:28,885
And.

271
00:18:31,057 --> 00:18:36,822
Aside from the sort of uplift from EA Play PC being bundled into the service, it's not

272
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:43,008
actually that much different from March's 500 titles, December 2021 is 515, a very small

273
00:18:43,028 --> 00:18:46,191
percentage, you know, a few percent increase in total volume.

274
00:18:46,871 --> 00:18:51,595
Possibly because they're thinking, well, do we, can we actually, is it commercially viable

275
00:18:51,635 --> 00:18:52,276
to have more?

276
00:18:53,317 --> 00:18:54,858
Is it going to become a discovery issue?

277
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:57,280
All these kind of factors that come into that decision making.

278
00:18:58,217 --> 00:19:00,979
There is some rotation in and out of those services, obviously.

279
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,163
So overall, there were 686 distinct titles in Game Pass in 2021.

280
00:19:07,443 --> 00:19:08,905
But still not a massive number.

281
00:19:09,385 --> 00:19:13,488
And a lot of those are kind of, you know, legacy titles

282
00:19:13,548 --> 00:19:15,830
or titles that won't come out of the service.

283
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:18,131
There's, you know, the slots are taken, in effect.

284
00:19:21,975 --> 00:19:24,496
If we look at the activity of publishers,

285
00:19:24,536 --> 00:19:27,756
this is another way we slice the catalogue data,

286
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:29,937
is to look at the company activity.

287
00:19:30,977 --> 00:19:34,038
You can see that there is around 700 companies

288
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:36,578
across these services active.

289
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:40,139
Many of them with one or two titles,

290
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:44,500
but there are a few which have built a more progressive amount of titles

291
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,700
that are going into the services.

292
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,320
And...

293
00:19:48,548 --> 00:19:51,470
It does suggest that there's already a certain level

294
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:56,094
of quite significant competition to get access to those catalogs

295
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:58,596
in terms of the activity of different companies.

296
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:02,639
But also, you know, it shows that there's a willingness

297
00:20:02,719 --> 00:20:07,243
to experiment and, you know, identify if there's a,

298
00:20:07,263 --> 00:20:09,785
you know, opportunity there, a worthwhile,

299
00:20:09,865 --> 00:20:11,506
incremental opportunity that's worthwhile.

300
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:17,330
This is a slide which looks at the Xbox Game Pass.

301
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:21,918
distinct games by actual publisher from December 2021.

302
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:25,001
You can see the Microsoft and EA titles,

303
00:20:25,061 --> 00:20:27,423
obviously, take the most volume,

304
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:29,685
big chunk of the share of those titles.

305
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:32,988
But there is a, you know,

306
00:20:33,008 --> 00:20:35,530
a wide range of different publishers that are active

307
00:20:35,571 --> 00:20:39,294
and some, in effect, direct publishers,

308
00:20:40,415 --> 00:20:42,917
you know, devs that are directly publishing into...

309
00:20:44,664 --> 00:20:47,966
this particular service, and I've highlighted the ones

310
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:50,767
which I think are relevant to the kind of indie space.

311
00:20:51,407 --> 00:20:54,228
And it shows that there is a kind of small

312
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:59,351
but relatively important role for the indie titles

313
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:01,872
across those different indie publishers.

314
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:06,274
This is obviously not all the publishers

315
00:21:06,294 --> 00:21:08,455
that are active in that particular service,

316
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:11,816
but they are the biggest, you know, in terms of ones

317
00:21:11,836 --> 00:21:13,957
that have got multiple titles in that service.

318
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:21,392
You know, the thing we have to consider is if Microsoft does

319
00:21:21,452 --> 00:21:24,155
add a lot of first party content, which it inevitably will

320
00:21:24,195 --> 00:21:28,559
do with the acquisitions that it's done, and it's looking

321
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:33,223
to acquire more higher profile sort of franchises

322
00:21:33,263 --> 00:21:35,585
from third parties that go into these services,

323
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:38,948
whether those smaller titles, less distinct titles

324
00:21:38,968 --> 00:21:42,492
or less well-known titles are increasingly squeezed in terms

325
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,433
of the kind of discovery loop.

326
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,773
And this slide just takes a little look at the,

327
00:21:53,575 --> 00:21:56,857
you know, one of the strategies in terms of publishing

328
00:21:57,598 --> 00:22:00,881
for Devolver Digital, looking at which services

329
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:02,042
they're putting their games into.

330
00:22:02,062 --> 00:22:05,425
I think what this shows is there's been a kind of

331
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:08,487
diversification of its strategy in the context of,

332
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:12,571
it's taken some of its products out of Xbox Game Pass

333
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:14,873
or it doesn't, it's reduced its exposure

334
00:22:14,913 --> 00:22:16,714
to Xbox Game Pass and its willingness to...

335
00:22:17,882 --> 00:22:20,803
diversify across other subscription services.

336
00:22:20,843 --> 00:22:23,704
So it's showing a fair amount of sophistication, I would say,

337
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:27,526
and that's what we're observing in terms of the strategies

338
00:22:27,586 --> 00:22:28,886
of different companies in this space

339
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:30,167
that they are slowly growing,

340
00:22:30,407 --> 00:22:32,147
kind of more sophisticated strategies.

341
00:22:36,849 --> 00:22:40,970
Another thing that's worth looking at is the kind

342
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,271
of complexity of the market environment.

343
00:22:43,291 --> 00:22:45,952
So of the services that we track...

344
00:22:46,836 --> 00:22:50,758
Some of those are what we describe as local telco-based services,

345
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:52,979
but they all have catalogues which are relevant

346
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,622
and can be tracked in the context of seeing

347
00:22:57,222 --> 00:23:00,844
if they are overlaps with, say, the international players.

348
00:23:01,725 --> 00:23:06,868
This visualisation is a tree map from our data tool,

349
00:23:06,908 --> 00:23:10,551
which looks at the different catalogues of services within Italy.

350
00:23:13,747 --> 00:23:17,510
So it's looking at some of the local services versus the global services and looking at

351
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,612
the overlaps between different services.

352
00:23:21,172 --> 00:23:26,756
And it shows already a good deal of complexity, sort of understanding where your, if you're

353
00:23:26,776 --> 00:23:34,481
a service company, you know, where your exclusives lie and how much content is really unique

354
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:35,582
in terms of your service.

355
00:23:36,975 --> 00:23:39,956
Also, this kind of information I think gives content owners

356
00:23:40,396 --> 00:23:44,197
the ability to negotiate better deals to kind of take advantage

357
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:47,558
of that complexity to understand the landscape

358
00:23:47,618 --> 00:23:50,579
and see where the gaps exist within particular portfolios

359
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,819
and where you can have the maximum impact

360
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:54,680
in terms of your particular products

361
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,461
if you're looking to put those into subscription services.

362
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:03,482
So, I'm going to finish up. We talked a bit there about catalog.

363
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:06,183
I'm going to finish up with some slides.

364
00:24:07,062 --> 00:24:14,004
around consumer research basically that we do to look at some of the characteristics of subscription

365
00:24:14,024 --> 00:24:21,146
gamers. And generally you know they are much more active than your average gamer so

366
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:26,688
here it shows they spend 23 percent more time on a weekly basis playing games.

367
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:29,006
substantially more engaged.

368
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:32,447
If we look at the average number of subscriptions per gamer,

369
00:24:33,028 --> 00:24:35,749
I think it's interesting, obviously US is the heaviest

370
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,131
there, the other markets that we do our survey work in,

371
00:24:39,171 --> 00:24:41,092
you can see that there's a kind of downward trend.

372
00:24:43,313 --> 00:24:46,115
I guess there's some thinking there in terms of your,

373
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:51,238
if you're thinking of your content strategy, will, you know,

374
00:24:51,538 --> 00:24:53,819
if you're looking to engage an audience

375
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:55,660
in specific territories, then.

376
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,433
You know, whether you're putting your gains into subscription services or not,

377
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:03,193
you know, there's a decision to make there if you feel that it's under sort

378
00:25:03,213 --> 00:25:05,754
of represented in certain markets, for example.

379
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:11,996
It also illustrates that there is significant growth potential, I think,

380
00:25:12,016 --> 00:25:18,998
for subscription services in these other markets where in the US it's, I wouldn't say it's mature,

381
00:25:19,058 --> 00:25:22,459
but it's obviously more advanced, but it gives you an idea of the kind of ceiling

382
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,760
that could be achieved in some other Western territories, for example.

383
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,322
We also ask consumers how they discover games.

384
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,343
And there's some significant differences

385
00:25:34,403 --> 00:25:43,665
between what game content subscribers do

386
00:25:43,745 --> 00:25:47,386
to find their games versus your average gamer.

387
00:25:48,386 --> 00:25:53,187
So subscribers look to social media, online video sites,

388
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:54,268
and games.

389
00:25:55,086 --> 00:26:02,413
Platform online stores as their kind of sources for discovering content. It's quite interesting that games platform online stores

390
00:26:02,453 --> 00:26:04,334
So high for a subscription service

391
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:11,301
It kind of reiterates the idea that actually they're much more engaged and they're willing to spend across all kind of different content areas

392
00:26:14,383 --> 00:26:17,506
For the average game a word-of-mouth is actually much is at the top

393
00:26:17,766 --> 00:26:22,090
So there's a significant difference in the way they discover that you know might be very

394
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:25,923
interesting to you in terms of reaching different audiences

395
00:26:26,063 --> 00:26:29,206
and that would be relevant across those kind

396
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:31,327
of discovery channels, I guess.

397
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,792
This is looking at Game Pass subscribers, and it's looking

398
00:26:37,812 --> 00:26:40,113
at just some of the basic demographics.

399
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:44,016
So this is the age range, and you can see

400
00:26:44,116 --> 00:26:45,977
that the age of Game Pass.

401
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,559
So this is a comparison of Game Pass.

402
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:53,533
Xbox players with Game Pass subscribers versus Xbox console gamers with no Game Pass.

403
00:26:53,973 --> 00:27:01,238
And you can see that it skews a bit older in terms of the subscribers.

404
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:06,962
And I think that's because, and also they have, you know, more likely to be living with children

405
00:27:06,982 --> 00:27:11,625
at home. It's more sort of family oriented. In terms of the...

406
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:20,141
Devices that they play on vary devices, so multiple devices and quite high penetration

407
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:24,205
of obviously console as you'd expect but also smartphone for example, which

408
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:31,251
goes with the idea that Game Pass is progressively multi-screen in terms of its strategy. You can

409
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:37,877
see how that fits into the types of consumer that are using Game Pass.

410
00:27:39,998 --> 00:27:43,320
And this looks at the spend across different categories

411
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:49,303
of, again, Game Pass subscribers versus Xbox console gamers

412
00:27:49,644 --> 00:27:50,604
without Game Pass.

413
00:27:50,644 --> 00:27:52,605
And you can see that across all categories,

414
00:27:53,446 --> 00:27:55,127
they tend to spend more.

415
00:27:56,488 --> 00:28:00,290
This is not as, I guess, dramatic spend uptick

416
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:03,812
as some of the data that Microsoft has released itself.

417
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:06,234
It released some more data today, actually,

418
00:28:06,274 --> 00:28:07,034
looking at the spend.

419
00:28:07,785 --> 00:28:11,006
But it does kind of correlate and I guess,

420
00:28:11,746 --> 00:28:13,107
you know, from an independent source,

421
00:28:13,127 --> 00:28:15,948
this reiterates the idea that they are willing to be,

422
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,128
they are more engaged and they're also spending

423
00:28:18,168 --> 00:28:22,430
more content, more on content across different forms

424
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,890
of monetization.

425
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,831
So getting access to that audience

426
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:29,693
is actually quite beneficial in that context.

427
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:34,934
And this slide looks at the genre taste

428
00:28:34,994 --> 00:28:36,915
of the game genre taste of Game Pass.

429
00:28:37,646 --> 00:28:41,289
subscribers versus a game, Xbox console gamers without Game Pass.

430
00:28:41,949 --> 00:28:46,673
And I guess some of the key differences is that there seems to be a willingness

431
00:28:46,853 --> 00:28:58,661
to have a more sort of varied genre taste versus, you know, the average Xbox console user who is

432
00:28:58,761 --> 00:29:02,724
looking at, you know, is heavily into shooters, etc. There's less...

433
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:09,039
interest in that. There's more interest in more casual games and a sort of broader

434
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,225
appeal I think of different games. And I think that reflects the family type experience,

435
00:29:16,706 --> 00:29:21,010
the family environment that Game Pass subscribers are playing games in.

436
00:29:23,413 --> 00:29:24,754
So just to wrap up.

437
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,411
This is a few sort of takeaways of the session.

438
00:29:31,092 --> 00:29:37,655
I don't believe that subscriptions will become the dominant monetization model for the game sector,

439
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,117
as it has done progressively within the video and music sectors.

440
00:29:43,439 --> 00:29:48,982
The fact that in-game monetization is worth such a significant chunk of overall spending

441
00:29:49,042 --> 00:29:51,523
means I think it's very unlikely that that's going to shift,

442
00:29:51,704 --> 00:29:54,345
it's going to be so significant for that to happen.

443
00:29:57,182 --> 00:30:00,563
There are multiple reasons to add games to subscription services.

444
00:30:00,603 --> 00:30:02,704
We touched on quite a few of them.

445
00:30:03,364 --> 00:30:04,865
It's not just about direct revenue,

446
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:09,486
but there's opportunities for marketing your product into services,

447
00:30:09,626 --> 00:30:12,667
using it as a marketing platform, engaging a broader audience,

448
00:30:13,347 --> 00:30:15,828
a more varied audience, an engaged audience

449
00:30:15,888 --> 00:30:22,410
that might be interested in a broader collection of content.

450
00:30:26,852 --> 00:30:30,034
The Game Pass domination of the market at the moment,

451
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:33,235
I think it does potentially have some implications,

452
00:30:33,295 --> 00:30:37,577
but we've got to think about where those implications are

453
00:30:37,597 --> 00:30:38,217
going to play out.

454
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:40,718
And I think that, you know, if we're

455
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:43,259
thinking of the broader market, if you're just

456
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,201
focused on Xbox as a platform, for example, console-based,

457
00:30:47,881 --> 00:30:52,523
then I think you would think about it more seriously.

458
00:30:52,563 --> 00:30:54,344
But the implications are more focused

459
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:56,185
where Game Pass is dominant.

460
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,742
There are additional sales opportunities to take advantage of,

461
00:31:00,782 --> 00:31:05,525
which I think there's a window of opportunity to take advantage

462
00:31:05,665 --> 00:31:09,108
of those sales or those commercial deals that are taking place

463
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:12,830
within the gaming space with telcos and local providers.

464
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:13,851
But that is.

465
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:18,383
window of opportunity, I'm not sure how long it's going to be open for.

466
00:31:18,403 --> 00:31:23,447
There's a lot of interest at the moment because of the rollout of 5G and full fiber solutions.

467
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:28,050
So it's something to consider, I think, short term.

468
00:31:30,231 --> 00:31:35,655
We investigated the idea of indie content and the role it plays within the different services

469
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:37,717
and the importance of it.

470
00:31:39,118 --> 00:31:44,241
The question is whether in certain services, as they become more high profile,

471
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:51,645
the scale of those services grows, and we get to a point where, you know, bigger franchises

472
00:31:51,685 --> 00:31:56,026
are considering going into those services and there's first party content, whether,

473
00:31:56,886 --> 00:32:02,907
you know, those smaller games get increasingly squeezed and the terms of acquiring those

474
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:07,428
or putting those games into those services starts to deteriorate in some way.

475
00:32:08,749 --> 00:32:10,429
And we investigate the subscribers.

476
00:32:11,331 --> 00:32:13,533
to these content subscription services

477
00:32:13,593 --> 00:32:16,056
and how they are different to the average gamer.

478
00:32:16,576 --> 00:32:18,398
In fact, they're more engaged, they play more,

479
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:22,142
they spend more, and they have more varied gaming tastes

480
00:32:22,322 --> 00:32:26,807
means they are an interesting and certainly worthwhile

481
00:32:26,927 --> 00:32:29,950
group of consumers to get access to.

482
00:32:32,052 --> 00:32:32,753
Thank you very much.

483
00:32:41,531 --> 00:32:43,877
So I'm happy to answer a couple of questions if anyone's got.

484
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:51,231
Hello Simon.

485
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:52,571
Hello.

486
00:32:53,252 --> 00:32:57,733
Yeah, I had a question about the, say, the indie publishers, and I know that Devolver

487
00:32:57,773 --> 00:33:01,974
put in some of its risks when it went public on AIM, that they were concerned that the

488
00:33:02,054 --> 00:33:07,616
upside from, you know, single player indie games that don't have IAP might be diminished

489
00:33:07,776 --> 00:33:09,576
over time with Game Pass.

490
00:33:09,656 --> 00:33:12,197
Can you talk to whether you think that will be an issue?

491
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:16,438
I think that's one of the, you know, one of the question marks.

492
00:33:16,458 --> 00:33:20,080
I don't think anyone really knows, but I think...

493
00:33:21,058 --> 00:33:31,081
that it's more less about probably kind of service-based games and more about the kind

494
00:33:31,102 --> 00:33:36,483
of franchise-based, you know, higher profile titles and that's taking a lot of the, you know,

495
00:33:36,523 --> 00:33:42,345
engagement and eyeballs. The first party releases thing, I think that's one of the more pressing

496
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:47,526
immediate impacts that could be felt. And whether that's...

497
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:55,589
you know, it has an impact because of the awareness of certain titles and their coming

498
00:33:55,609 --> 00:34:01,251
into the service, then that takes a lot of engagement. I think if you combine that with

499
00:34:01,751 --> 00:34:05,612
service-based games, then you're getting a bit of a sort of perfect storm in terms of

500
00:34:05,672 --> 00:34:12,714
taking a lot of the engagement away. So I think there is some concern over that, but

501
00:34:12,734 --> 00:34:13,694
then we've got to think, well...

502
00:34:14,785 --> 00:34:16,286
Now, where is this taking place?

503
00:34:16,647 --> 00:34:18,488
In the broader market, there's a much bigger,

504
00:34:18,528 --> 00:34:21,831
broader market out there, but this is relatively contained

505
00:34:21,931 --> 00:34:24,052
to this particular area of the market

506
00:34:24,112 --> 00:34:27,655
within progressively the Xbox platform.

507
00:34:27,675 --> 00:34:31,018
But, you know, in terms of it could impact, you know,

508
00:34:31,038 --> 00:34:34,380
the thinking around Sony's upcoming changes

509
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,762
to its subscription services and things.

510
00:34:36,802 --> 00:34:38,023
So it could kind of bleed over

511
00:34:38,063 --> 00:34:40,165
into other competitive console platforms.

512
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:46,867
I don't think it's going to have such an impact in the PC space, although Microsoft is committed

513
00:34:46,987 --> 00:34:51,609
to doing more PC games for Game Pass.

514
00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:59,353
So it's a little bit of an unknown, but I would say that there is some concern, but

515
00:34:59,373 --> 00:35:03,155
we have to put it into perspective in the context of the market.

516
00:35:05,413 --> 00:35:05,774
Hey there.

517
00:35:06,694 --> 00:35:06,894
Hello.

518
00:35:07,335 --> 00:35:13,218
To what extent have you seen that the subscription service is actually driving the behavior of

519
00:35:13,258 --> 00:35:17,881
being more engaged and spending more versus the people who are more likely to spend and

520
00:35:17,921 --> 00:35:21,303
be engaged are also those who would sign up for a subscription service?

521
00:35:21,464 --> 00:35:24,205
It's a bit of a chicken and egg question, isn't it?

522
00:35:25,909 --> 00:35:28,270
I think there is probably a bit of both.

523
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,431
So the most engaged people are happy to try out,

524
00:35:31,471 --> 00:35:33,091
be the first early adopters or whatever.

525
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,992
But we're now at a phase, if you're looking at Game Pass,

526
00:35:36,032 --> 00:35:37,532
they've got 25 million subscriptions.

527
00:35:40,213 --> 00:35:42,133
There's no doubt that those people that

528
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:45,554
may have signed up to that, even in a family setting,

529
00:35:45,594 --> 00:35:47,355
they're willing to try more content

530
00:35:47,435 --> 00:35:49,976
and try varied content and try games that they

531
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:51,476
wouldn't have tried before.

532
00:35:51,496 --> 00:35:51,536
So.

533
00:35:54,874 --> 00:36:01,504
It's probably a little bit of a mixture of both, but I would say that it's legitimate on both of those kind of characteristics.

534
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:04,789
Got you. Thank you.

535
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:05,710
No problem.

536
00:36:08,887 --> 00:36:11,068
As a game developer, what's the right way

537
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:13,009
to weigh the financial opportunity

538
00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:15,491
of doing an exclusive with a game subscription service

539
00:36:15,571 --> 00:36:17,252
as opposed to traditional publishing?

540
00:36:17,772 --> 00:36:18,293
That's a good question.

541
00:36:18,313 --> 00:36:20,494
I think that's a very hard decision to make

542
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:23,636
because obviously it depends on what you feel

543
00:36:23,776 --> 00:36:26,498
you can do as a company for your particular product

544
00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:28,699
and the terms that you're being offered.

545
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,902
And I think the terms are, realistically,

546
00:36:31,922 --> 00:36:33,823
they're probably gonna become for,

547
00:36:34,363 --> 00:36:35,564
well, certainly smaller developers,

548
00:36:35,584 --> 00:36:36,905
they're gonna come under pressure.

549
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:38,466
I mean, there's.

550
00:36:40,522 --> 00:36:43,724
within specific services, I think.

551
00:36:44,465 --> 00:36:46,306
And it's down to what the service provider's

552
00:36:46,326 --> 00:36:47,747
trying to achieve as well.

553
00:36:48,267 --> 00:36:51,190
My assumption is that the financial incentives will

554
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,571
be less, but the exposure greater.

555
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:54,032
Is that the right way to view it?

556
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:55,052
Sorry, can you repeat that?

557
00:36:55,373 --> 00:36:56,834
That the exposure is going to be wider,

558
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,535
but the financial return is probably

559
00:36:58,555 --> 00:36:59,936
going to be lower for that specific game?

560
00:37:00,776 --> 00:37:01,617
Well, I think if you take.

561
00:37:02,324 --> 00:37:07,088
You know, Xbox Game Pass, an example, they have their own, you know, their own content,

562
00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:09,771
a significantly expanding pipeline.

563
00:37:10,572 --> 00:37:16,197
I think that strategy is to rely less on paying huge sums to get third-party content into there.

564
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,701
So I think it's inevitable that there will not be as...

565
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:23,285
the terms won't be as good and the deals will be...

566
00:37:24,852 --> 00:37:31,576
you know, will probably reduce to an extent, but maybe not in the sort of near to, maybe

567
00:37:31,616 --> 00:37:35,598
not over the next 12, 24 months, because they're still relying on that third party content.

568
00:37:35,998 --> 00:37:40,661
And also there's this push, you know, I think Microsoft's doing a push into the PC space.

569
00:37:41,682 --> 00:37:47,045
So it depends on what they're trying to achieve and what platforms they're trying to achieve

570
00:37:47,085 --> 00:37:47,365
it on.

571
00:37:49,667 --> 00:37:52,568
And so there's lots of variables, I would say, in it.

572
00:37:52,608 --> 00:37:53,569
The thing is, it's not.

573
00:37:54,585 --> 00:38:00,072
The risk is it's not standardized, I would say.

574
00:38:00,433 --> 00:38:02,395
It's not standardized across different services.

575
00:38:02,936 --> 00:38:05,038
It can change over time.

576
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:10,065
So that's where one of the significant risks is.

577
00:38:10,085 --> 00:38:12,027
And if you're developing a thing with the idea, OK.

578
00:38:14,194 --> 00:38:19,077
I'm going to push it into the one of these service that's the terms that you negotiate,

579
00:38:20,057 --> 00:38:25,620
you know, they may be different in sort of 12, 18 months time from when you thought,

580
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,201
you know, you heard what the terms were previously, you know.

581
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:30,362
So I think there's some risk involved there.

582
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:37,266
Any other queries?

583
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:47,925
Just one quick question. I'm curious your thoughts about how the emergence of game streaming is going to impact the growth of subscriptions over the next several years.

584
00:38:52,162 --> 00:38:58,306
Game streaming is a kind of incremental distribution opportunity I would say.

585
00:38:58,326 --> 00:39:01,789
It depends a lot on...

586
00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:09,894
So the biggest services are those services which use both download and streaming to an extent.

587
00:39:10,835 --> 00:39:15,038
So those services are majority download at the moment.

588
00:39:17,676 --> 00:39:24,882
Obviously the expansion strategy is to use streaming to reach audiences they haven't reached before.

589
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:32,088
But that depends on the type of product offering they put together and the sort of price points and stuff.

590
00:39:32,268 --> 00:39:40,835
And certainly in mobile first markets, for example, and interesting opportunities, say, for example, in India, I don't know.

591
00:39:43,776 --> 00:39:48,317
Latin America or other Asian, Southeast Asia, you know, where there's a kind of mobile first

592
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:58,099
opportunity, you have to think about whether there's going to be a sort of commercially viable

593
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:02,620
strategy for packaging together something at a lower price point that's only specifically

594
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:09,462
for mobile platforms, for example, for Game Pass. Great, thanks. No problem.

595
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:13,805
I think we're sort of running out of time, anyway, I think that was possibly the last

596
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:18,226
question, but I'm happy to chat with anyone who wants to chat, and thank you very much

597
00:40:18,266 --> 00:40:18,906
indeed for coming.
