1
00:00:05,536 --> 00:00:08,100
to the state and future of board game design,

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,703
where I have with me, when you're ready.

3
00:00:13,628 --> 00:00:14,288
Welcome, thank you.

4
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:15,050
My name's Paul Dean.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,912
I'm one of the founders of Shut Up and Sit Down.

6
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:19,276
We have a huge games area.

7
00:00:20,683 --> 00:00:25,407
Thank you. On the third floor in the corner of this hall, so if you'd like to come and play

8
00:00:25,447 --> 00:00:30,471
games or look at games or watch other people playing games or just sit at a table and eat a

9
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:33,974
sandwich, which a lot of people are doing at the moment, please come by because we're there

10
00:00:34,014 --> 00:00:37,376
like all week and it's quite a lot of fun and there's a lot of different interesting people. I

11
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:42,180
have very limited games design experience. I have been one of the team who helped create the

12
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,744
latest version of the Paranoia RPG, which is coming out soon I think, I hope, because we

13
00:00:46,784 --> 00:00:47,204
finished it.

14
00:00:47,764 --> 00:00:51,387
With me are people who are going to be better at introducing themselves than I will.

15
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:54,450
So I'm going to start on my left side with this fellow.

16
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,231
Who are you, sir, and what have you recently done?

17
00:00:56,271 --> 00:01:00,175
Let's see if this microphone... Oh, microphone is on.

18
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:08,001
Hi, I'm Jeff Engelstein, and I guess my most recent games that came out were

19
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:11,344
the Dragon and Flagon board game and the Fog of War.

20
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:15,567
I've got two new games that are going to be coming out in the spring.

21
00:01:17,342 --> 00:01:20,744
Pit Crew and The Expanse, based on the sci-fi show.

22
00:01:21,004 --> 00:01:23,225
I'm also on the, thank you.

23
00:01:24,905 --> 00:01:26,926
I'm also on the Dice Tower podcast,

24
00:01:27,386 --> 00:01:28,607
do the game tech segment there,

25
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:31,208
as well as the Ludology podcast,

26
00:01:31,248 --> 00:01:34,949
which is a hour-long podcast about game design

27
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,310
and various game-related topics.

28
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:39,971
Oh, yeah.

29
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:40,551
Good, okay.

30
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:42,792
Succinct, I heard succinct was the keyword.

31
00:01:43,934 --> 00:01:46,577
I've been told to try and keep these people succinct, we'll see how that goes.

32
00:01:46,738 --> 00:01:50,082
On my right, immediately next to me, I have a Canadian.

33
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:52,064
Would you introduce yourself, sir?

34
00:01:52,084 --> 00:01:54,087
Hi, I'm a Canadian, and I'm sorry.

35
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:04,940
My name is Eric Lang. I'm a board game designer, a tabletop designer. I've been doing this for a

36
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:13,485
long time. I've been done, I've designed a lot of board games for Fantasy Flight, Cool Mini or Not, some work for Wizards of the Coast.

37
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:15,766
I've done some digital work on

38
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:20,069
Duelists, the online trading card game, which we're doing a talk for on Friday.

39
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:27,013
I've never been on Jeff Engelstein's Ludology podcast, so that clearly I'm the lesser of the guests.

40
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:27,874
It's a definite snub.

41
00:02:31,114 --> 00:02:36,567
And a bunch of other games that I'm forgetting here in this moment.

42
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:37,509
You did Blood Rage.

43
00:02:38,051 --> 00:02:39,073
I did Blood Rage, there we go.

44
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:47,737
And furthest on my right I have the foremost expert on Eric's portfolio, as Eric isn't.

45
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:48,958
You are, sir?

46
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:55,946
My name is Rob Davio, I've been doing professional board game design since 1998, 18 years, 14

47
00:02:56,406 --> 00:03:00,150
of which was at Hasbro, so I've worked on a lot of classic games, Clues and Monopolies

48
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:00,570
and Risks.

49
00:03:01,484 --> 00:03:10,069
I've been doing about four years on my own, where you probably, if you know me, know me from asking to rip up cards with legacy games.

50
00:03:10,089 --> 00:03:13,751
So, Seafall, Pandemic Legacy, Risk Legacy.

51
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:20,835
I also am part of a new company called Restoration Games, where we take old games that are out of print and restore them.

52
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,818
and bring them back and I get the cool title

53
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:24,120
of Chief Restoration Officer.

54
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:27,926
So I spend a lot of time actually also thinking

55
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:29,829
about the business end of things like graphics

56
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:31,532
and pallets and shipping and warehousing.

57
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:33,835
And you also design Blood Rage.

58
00:03:34,376 --> 00:03:35,318
And I also design Blood Rage.

59
00:03:39,226 --> 00:03:41,729
You will notice on each side of you there are microphones.

60
00:03:41,809 --> 00:03:43,431
If you would like to queue up and ask questions,

61
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:45,194
we will be taking questions from the audience.

62
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:45,834
Do not be scared.

63
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:49,379
This is probably the nicest panel that we have at GDC

64
00:03:49,499 --> 00:03:50,921
and the most approachable people.

65
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:53,604
So if you want to begin queuing up at any time.

66
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:59,069
feel free. Until then, I want to open... I mean, I assume that we all know that board

67
00:03:59,089 --> 00:04:02,510
games have really taken off. I assume that we all know it's become recently in North

68
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,272
America like a billion dollar industry. So it's a thing now, otherwise none of you would

69
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:09,833
be here and interested in this. So I'm going to assume that you know that a lot of the

70
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:15,536
design practices are similar, a lot of the foundations are similar. Why, Jeff, is it

71
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:21,178
a particularly good or interesting time to be a games designer right now? For board games.

72
00:04:22,365 --> 00:04:26,876
Well, I think that there's a lot of really interesting things going on.

73
00:04:27,117 --> 00:04:30,204
One is just based on the expansion of the market itself.

74
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,400
probably about 10, 15, 20% year-over-year growth

75
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,501
in the number of games coming out.

76
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,881
I think last year there were over 3,000 new board games

77
00:04:40,982 --> 00:04:42,742
added to the Board Game Geek database,

78
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:45,683
which is a lot of games.

79
00:04:46,063 --> 00:04:49,063
It seems like the audience is growing, at least for now,

80
00:04:49,483 --> 00:04:51,044
and so we're getting a lot of,

81
00:04:51,664 --> 00:04:52,924
you can do a lot of interesting things

82
00:04:52,984 --> 00:04:54,185
and you'll still be able to find

83
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:55,505
some type of audience for your game.

84
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:58,426
I've also been really excited about a lot of the new

85
00:05:00,396 --> 00:05:06,479
techniques that are perhaps taken from video games or certainly from movies and stories are bringing more narrative into games and

86
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:11,101
you know with games like pandemic legacy that Rob did and and others that

87
00:05:12,202 --> 00:05:13,122
There's a lot more

88
00:05:14,383 --> 00:05:22,026
Very interesting type of work being done that we haven't seen before whether it's episodic games like time stories or the legacy games

89
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:22,226
where

90
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:27,591
things are going in different directions and there's just a lot of creativity.

91
00:05:27,651 --> 00:05:32,335
So I've been very gratified to see that and that it's gotten some consumer acceptance.

92
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,998
It's not just little art projects, but it's things that you can put out there and will actually sell.

93
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,542
Jens, is that true? By the way, because you're on different sides, you're now opponents.

94
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:44,666
Yes. So I will disagree with the Honorable Representative from New Jersey.

95
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,582
Yes, the pie is growing, but I feel like the number of games and the number of publishers,

96
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,763
the number of designers are growing faster.

97
00:05:54,343 --> 00:05:58,484
And we are at a point where it's getting hard to get attention.

98
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:02,146
Right? It used to be if you had a name as a designer, that might be enough.

99
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:03,666
Or if you had a brand, that was enough.

100
00:06:03,726 --> 00:06:09,148
Or if you had great art, like, now it feels like you need to have all of those three and get lucky.

101
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,120
And get the good reviews.

102
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,361
And if those all come together, you'll get three to five months in the sun

103
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:15,501
to try to make some money on it.

104
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:17,661
And then the next big shiny thing comes around.

105
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,402
And if you don't get all of those, you might get three to five weeks

106
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:22,562
before the next shiny thing comes around.

107
00:06:22,602 --> 00:06:24,043
So it's good right now.

108
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,463
I can make a living.

109
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:28,204
I made a living off it last year and I'll make it this year.

110
00:06:28,384 --> 00:06:32,705
But two years from now, you know, I don't know how long it will necessarily last.

111
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:37,894
Wow. But you were looking at me like I was...

112
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:43,039
No, that was, uh, coming from a chap who's established and has quite a cool portfolio...

113
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:46,101
Eric, do you agree? I mean, you've made a lot of different games...

114
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:46,982
You told me to oppose him!

115
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:47,582
This is the...

116
00:06:47,882 --> 00:06:52,206
Oh, you can agree or... Well, I mean, surely you are constantly getting work.

117
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:54,968
You seem to be releasing games all the time. Are you not okay?

118
00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:00,352
I, comma, Professor Gloom, I guess somewhat agree with Professor Doom...

119
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:07,972
But to a degree, I mean, it has never been a better time to be a, academically speaking,

120
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,533
it's never been a better time to be a game designer.

121
00:07:09,553 --> 00:07:16,238
I mean, the foundation of the craft of game design is at a level that it's never been

122
00:07:16,278 --> 00:07:16,759
at before.

123
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:17,960
I would say the average.

124
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:28,850
The average middle-enfranchised game player now understands game design probably to a level that top-level game designers in the 70s and 80s didn't understand at all.

125
00:07:29,972 --> 00:07:38,680
There's a wealth of great material online from established game companies, Wizards of the Coast, even Fantasy Flight.

126
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,989
increasing our body of knowledge to a greater degree.

127
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:47,030
Because of that, of course, it is also increasing competition.

128
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,051
Because within every gamer, there is a budding game designer.

129
00:07:51,131 --> 00:07:53,591
We're all creative people, we all like to express ourselves.

130
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:58,313
And like writing, game design appears to be very easy on the surface.

131
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:03,774
So there are many, many more people who want to become game designers

132
00:08:03,794 --> 00:08:08,275
than there are slots for professional game designers to earn a living.

133
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:08,935
But.

134
00:08:10,743 --> 00:08:13,344
I embrace that, I think it's, to me, it keeps me on my toes.

135
00:08:13,404 --> 00:08:15,785
Rob and I actually discussed that a couple weeks ago, right?

136
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:20,607
We don't really feel like we're at the head of a curve,

137
00:08:20,647 --> 00:08:22,387
we actually feel like we're at the top of a cliff,

138
00:08:22,687 --> 00:08:25,589
waiting to be, like, at any time,

139
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:28,870
waiting to be pushed off by the smarter guys

140
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,031
that we're gonna come, or smarter guys, or girls,

141
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:34,212
that are gonna come in here and just kick our asses.

142
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:35,955
Wow.

143
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:38,016
You told us to oppose him.

144
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:41,659
But isn't this not sort of partly how it should work?

145
00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:44,001
Like the best people should be noticed?

146
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:45,582
That's energizing, yeah.

147
00:08:45,622 --> 00:08:47,063
If the barriers to entry particularly,

148
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:49,084
like you can paper prototype a board game

149
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:51,846
in your house with paperclips and cardboard

150
00:08:51,886 --> 00:08:53,708
and things like that and you don't need to learn Unity,

151
00:08:53,768 --> 00:08:54,929
you don't need to learn GameMaker.

152
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:57,010
Surely having the barrier of entry low

153
00:08:57,651 --> 00:08:59,332
is a positive thing and it gets,

154
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,754
it fills the world with juicy ideas.

155
00:09:02,494 --> 00:09:03,835
No, yes, absolutely.

156
00:09:03,855 --> 00:09:06,657
But I think that, yeah, it's certainly,

157
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:08,599
if you look at the industry as a whole,

158
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:11,201
I think it's very healthy and exciting,

159
00:09:11,261 --> 00:09:12,802
and you look at the, it's a great time

160
00:09:12,842 --> 00:09:13,923
to be a board game player.

161
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:14,724
Yeah.

162
00:09:14,984 --> 00:09:17,246
But yeah, I mean, in terms of a designer,

163
00:09:17,326 --> 00:09:20,268
there's, yeah, it's very, very difficult to get noticed,

164
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:22,890
and I will certainly agree with that.

165
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,113
And that's why I'm, one of the things I've seen

166
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:28,875
is it seems like licensed games

167
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,725
tend to get pushed to the front of the line.

168
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:33,047
There's so many games that are coming out

169
00:09:33,087 --> 00:09:35,469
that it almost seems like a lot of these licenses

170
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:36,690
are the bigger names.

171
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:39,673
So you'll see like, just to take a random example,

172
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:42,856
you'll see like Pandemic has 87 different variations

173
00:09:42,936 --> 00:09:44,417
because it's got that brand name,

174
00:09:44,477 --> 00:09:45,438
it's got that recognition.

175
00:09:45,498 --> 00:09:47,120
So you see what you're seeing in the movies

176
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,882
where it's just another X-Men movie

177
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,183
or another Avengers movie or whatever,

178
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,844
you're kind of seeing that in the game world

179
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:55,208
as well as a way to get attention and to get noticed.

180
00:09:55,897 --> 00:10:00,339
Is that a way to get good regular work or a way to more reliably make money?

181
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,142
Is it even a good idea to perhaps create a game that you can sort of paste a theme onto later?

182
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:09,303
Well as a designer, if you have another pandemic...

183
00:10:10,124 --> 00:10:12,325
So... I'm not the pandemic, he's not there.

184
00:10:14,426 --> 00:10:16,606
Yeah, no, I think it's actually... This is a business.

185
00:10:16,646 --> 00:10:18,467
We're talking about the business of making games.

186
00:10:18,847 --> 00:10:21,489
It's different than the passion for making games.

187
00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:25,030
Like when you said that inside every gamer is a game designer, something I talk about is...

188
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:30,650
A lot of people can make games and have a game and play with their friends and that might be enough

189
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:35,692
Or they might want to get one game published but never leave their day job and that's enough

190
00:10:35,732 --> 00:10:41,274
what we're talking about if we're talking about the business of games and Eric and I do it full-time and Jeff does it part-time is

191
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,036
What do you need to do to make a living at it?

192
00:10:45,096 --> 00:10:47,357
And then you start putting all these business parameters around,

193
00:10:47,377 --> 00:10:51,580
like what's the brand recognition and what's the art and what's the release date

194
00:10:51,721 --> 00:10:54,503
and do I make it language independent and what's the audience

195
00:10:54,543 --> 00:10:58,806
and all these sort of unsexy things when you talk about game design

196
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:01,468
because it's about game publishing then and the business of it

197
00:11:01,508 --> 00:11:04,049
rather than the joy of just making a game.

198
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:10,275
I heard right yeah, there's a thing called Kickstarter, and if I put my game on it. Yeah, I

199
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:12,316
People would just see that my name is really good

200
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:13,798
And they'll pledge a lot of money

201
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:18,842
And I won't even need a publisher and then some people somewhere will print it and send it out

202
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:21,864
And I'll make a lot of money because I've seen people make

203
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:31,252
Insert adjective here sums of money on there is that a solution is that a symptom of the situation that we're in

204
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,162
I am fascinated by this, I'd like to know more about it.

205
00:11:34,182 --> 00:11:34,622
Tell me more.

206
00:11:34,642 --> 00:11:36,263
No, um...

207
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:37,163
Because if...

208
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:41,966
Maybe this is my interpretation, it feels to me like Kickstarter is filling a hole,

209
00:11:42,226 --> 00:11:44,648
or sort of like it's a panacea to some degree.

210
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:47,009
I don't know if it's filling a hole,

211
00:11:47,469 --> 00:11:51,332
so it's filling a hole on the supply side of the market for sure, right?

212
00:11:51,372 --> 00:11:53,553
Because it does bypass the...

213
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:57,055
It bypasses the critical processes of publishers, right?

214
00:11:57,535 --> 00:11:58,896
So, there is...

215
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:06,135
The bar of entry for producing a board game is of course much lower than a digital game,

216
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:09,359
especially on first blush.

217
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:15,305
But it has increased the number of games that are coming out of course,

218
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:19,870
so the supply side is much, much higher than the demand side at this particular point.

219
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:26,954
It is creating a lot of, I guess we call it painful successes, right?

220
00:12:26,994 --> 00:12:32,619
Where people who succeed, especially modestly on Kickstarter,

221
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:36,923
then suddenly have to become a publisher, de facto publisher,

222
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:41,306
and it turns them into a full-time fulfillment house,

223
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,949
which is an extremely difficult logistics.

224
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:48,353
logistical business and most people don't want to do that.

225
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:50,936
None, I think all of us included.

226
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:52,537
I've done it, I don't want to do it.

227
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:54,399
No, I do it for two years.

228
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,783
Yeah, no, the act of making, designing a game

229
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:00,005
is like hard work but fun, like writing a book

230
00:13:00,085 --> 00:13:01,407
or making a song or any creative endeavor.

231
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:04,370
And then the act of turning that into production files

232
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,051
is like a different sort of fun project.

233
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:10,253
And I think most people or many people who use Kickstarters,

234
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:12,175
and I think a lot of people don't feel this way anymore,

235
00:13:12,215 --> 00:13:15,337
and there's ways to, like third parties that can help you,

236
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:19,300
the act of moving pallets of cardboard on boats,

237
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,183
the fun tends to drop off for most people at that point,

238
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:25,545
and it becomes incredibly medieval.

239
00:13:26,217 --> 00:13:33,219
Like where you're talking about like dock workers and cargo and lading and getting it onto trains and trucks and breaking things down.

240
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,620
And it is not exceedingly difficult.

241
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:40,102
It is very, very easy to do if you are willing to lose money doing it.

242
00:13:40,883 --> 00:13:41,223
Wow.

243
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:44,184
Like because every step of the way, you're like, oh, we kind of, we should have done that.

244
00:13:44,284 --> 00:13:46,025
Oh, this should have cost less.

245
00:13:46,085 --> 00:13:47,645
Oh, this should have been in a smaller box.

246
00:13:47,845 --> 00:13:53,908
Oh, we didn't take into account this customs fee or we put the wrong age grade on the box and now we can't sell it here.

247
00:13:54,308 --> 00:13:54,968
And so like there's these.

248
00:13:55,887 --> 00:13:58,289
We did meet minimum standards in Brazil, whoops.

249
00:13:58,349 --> 00:13:58,529
Yeah.

250
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,471
So there's dozens of little mistakes

251
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:04,554
you can make as a publisher that will either prevent your game

252
00:14:04,574 --> 00:14:06,716
from being sold, or you'll spend too much time,

253
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:08,577
or you'll lose money, or not make the profits you

254
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,379
had projected because it kept taking pennies and pennies out

255
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:11,900
of your game.

256
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,983
So that's the hazard to Kickstarter is.

257
00:14:17,101 --> 00:14:20,662
Not everyone looks at what happens when you get the money.

258
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:23,322
And again, a lot of these stories were from three, four,

259
00:14:23,382 --> 00:14:25,643
five years ago when it was a little more Wild West.

260
00:14:25,703 --> 00:14:28,843
I think there are many people who know that now

261
00:14:28,903 --> 00:14:29,624
and do their homework.

262
00:14:29,804 --> 00:14:31,664
Surely now we have hundreds of kickstarted people

263
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,084
who all talk to each other and say,

264
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:34,765
do it this way and I did this and it went wrong

265
00:14:34,945 --> 00:14:36,385
and all the problems are solved.

266
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:37,925
I wish.

267
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:40,206
But I mean, I think it's instructive also that's.

268
00:14:41,836 --> 00:14:46,439
I'm probably not super qualified to talk on this because I've been predicting the demise of Kickstarter publicly for like

269
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,962
Six or seven years now or it probably since it first started so I don't have a great track record

270
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:56,166
But I mean you do see you know you still have your big mega successes like kingdom death

271
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:59,288
Which was what 12 million dollars or something insane like that?

272
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:02,049
and and scythe and things but

273
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,091
The bigger guys that used to be doing it,

274
00:15:05,211 --> 00:15:07,893
like Cool Mini has publicly said

275
00:15:07,933 --> 00:15:09,694
that they're gonna start backing away

276
00:15:10,094 --> 00:15:11,975
from the Kickstarter model

277
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:14,116
and go with a more traditional publisher route.

278
00:15:14,216 --> 00:15:15,437
Queen was doing more Kickstarters

279
00:15:15,477 --> 00:15:16,297
and they're backing away.

280
00:15:16,317 --> 00:15:17,898
You know, Stronghold tried it

281
00:15:17,938 --> 00:15:19,339
and they're not planning on doing another one.

282
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:20,859
So I think even,

283
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:24,968
Stone, Stonemire Games, I believe, is also,

284
00:15:25,128 --> 00:15:26,889
they've said that they're not going to be doing as much

285
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:28,369
on Kickstarter who did Scythe.

286
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:31,410
So I think that you're starting to see people

287
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,111
go back to a more traditional publishing model

288
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:36,252
except for, you know, the very small guys

289
00:15:36,272 --> 00:15:38,773
or the new people that are trying to break into the market.

290
00:15:40,954 --> 00:15:42,594
I do want to ask you guys sort of a couple,

291
00:15:42,694 --> 00:15:44,335
we're talking about the state and future of design,

292
00:15:44,355 --> 00:15:45,655
design-related questions as well,

293
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,256
otherwise I think we'll fall down a business hole,

294
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:48,856
but we have a gent who has a question.

295
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:50,157
Yeah, so I,

296
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:56,342
Automobile and appliance manufacturers learned last century

297
00:15:56,362 --> 00:15:57,923
that making something that you're going to own

298
00:15:57,943 --> 00:16:00,085
for the rest of your life is not a good business model,

299
00:16:00,145 --> 00:16:02,466
and we need you to buy a new one every five years or so.

300
00:16:03,187 --> 00:16:05,429
And I feel like the legacy style games

301
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:08,271
are these consumable board games where you play through it,

302
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:10,772
and I don't have my shelf of games

303
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:12,774
that I've had for 20 years that I play through it.

304
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:15,374
you know, 12 times and I'm done.

305
00:16:15,395 --> 00:16:19,259
I'm wondering is that a space do you think

306
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,141
the whole industry is gonna move towards

307
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,946
to keep people desiring and purchasing new content?

308
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:27,348
Oh yeah, I can start there.

309
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:29,451
I'll finish it.

310
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:42,998
Yeah, I think the industry... I think game players right now are already way too eager to play everything that comes out or turn through their pile or play something won and be done.

311
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:49,904
And then the cult of the new exists when you got three thousand things to choose from it's easy just to be like, oh, maybe this is better, right?

312
00:16:49,944 --> 00:16:51,725
Chasing the high of like the perfect game.

313
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:58,425
I'm giving a whole talk tomorrow morning at 9.30 about Legacy games, so I'm not going to derail this to do that, but

314
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:03,409
um, one thing that Legacy tried to do, which is often seen as doing the opposite, where you talk about like a

315
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:08,372
consumable or a disposable game, is I wanted to give you a reason to play it 15 times.

316
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:14,396
I didn't want to restrict you to play it 15 times, I wanted you to be like, that was fun, and if I play it a second time it'll be different,

317
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:20,600
and the third time it'll be different, and so that was actually a way to try to get you to go back to a game

318
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,942
rather than play it once and put it on the shelf and do the next one.

319
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,241
So I don't think anyone's trying to do anything consciously,

320
00:17:27,781 --> 00:17:28,602
well, I don't want to say that,

321
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:31,404
Time Stories is sort of disposable.

322
00:17:31,464 --> 00:17:32,505
Not disposable, usable.

323
00:17:32,745 --> 00:17:34,466
It's like a coloring book, you know?

324
00:17:34,806 --> 00:17:35,367
It sort of is.

325
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,427
Just before you answer, Jeff,

326
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:37,948
I want a quick sort of poll of the room.

327
00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:41,291
How many people here have, in terms of like buying games

328
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:42,692
that you might not get around to playing,

329
00:17:42,752 --> 00:17:44,433
who has a game that they bought that they haven't yet

330
00:17:44,473 --> 00:17:45,294
played there in their house?

331
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:46,614
Oh my God!

332
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:49,356
What a surprise, Jeff.

333
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,286
Um, yeah, I, I, I think that there's definitely a trend towards that.

334
00:17:57,426 --> 00:18:01,150
And as, as I, as I said in my little opening statement, I think that one of

335
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,333
the really interesting things you can do with kind of a limited play game

336
00:18:04,413 --> 00:18:06,035
is explore narrative and story.

337
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:10,337
You can build narrative arcs into games,

338
00:18:10,677 --> 00:18:12,198
and a lot of games have that,

339
00:18:12,238 --> 00:18:14,199
and successful games do that very well,

340
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,460
but it's hard to build a real true story

341
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,861
with turning points and stuff like that

342
00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:20,182
in a generative, procedural way,

343
00:18:20,262 --> 00:18:21,702
where it just kind of arises naturally

344
00:18:21,762 --> 00:18:22,483
out of what's going on.

345
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:27,826
by having games like Time Stories or things like that,

346
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:30,888
it gives the designer space to go into that.

347
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:35,671
And I'm curious to see how it plays out,

348
00:18:35,751 --> 00:18:41,195
because it's easy to plug in modular content

349
00:18:41,235 --> 00:18:42,216
if you're a digital platform.

350
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,677
Once somebody buys it, the distribution is a lot cheaper.

351
00:18:44,717 --> 00:18:46,679
With a board game, you're invested in something.

352
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,205
I think that maybe with marrying apps with board games

353
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:55,606
to push through different types of content.

354
00:18:56,187 --> 00:18:57,608
I've always wanted to do a game like

355
00:18:58,228 --> 00:18:59,069
Tales of the Arabian Nights,

356
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:01,210
which comes with that giant thick book of adventures

357
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,711
and basically like a choose your own adventure

358
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:03,392
paragraph thing.

359
00:19:04,032 --> 00:19:05,893
I'd love to just see all that in an app

360
00:19:06,193 --> 00:19:08,435
and then I can just, as a publisher,

361
00:19:08,495 --> 00:19:10,576
I can just push new content out through the app

362
00:19:10,596 --> 00:19:12,097
to get people to pull it off the shelf again

363
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,559
and say, hey, there's all kinds of new adventures in there.

364
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:16,600
Go in and do it and you have the framework

365
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,121
and you can do it.

366
00:19:17,141 --> 00:19:18,341
I think that's very interesting.

367
00:19:19,502 --> 00:19:24,427
But I, and I know I'll leave this to Eric to rebut,

368
00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:26,769
which I know he will, since we were talking about it earlier,

369
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:30,792
but I kind of liken this with games to movies,

370
00:19:31,073 --> 00:19:32,714
and there were some movies, I really,

371
00:19:36,077 --> 00:19:38,178
thought Schindler's List was extremely well done,

372
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:39,798
but I'm not gonna go see it,

373
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:43,020
like Airplane, which I watched 75 times,

374
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,181
I'm not going back to see Schindler's List.

375
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:45,501
So I think there's different experiences

376
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:48,443
where you can have something that's kind of one and done,

377
00:19:48,463 --> 00:19:50,124
and then there's other things that you will keep

378
00:19:50,164 --> 00:19:52,445
going back to and experience in a different way.

379
00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:54,426
Go on, shoot him down.

380
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,727
Well, so, we'll shoot you down afterward.

381
00:19:59,947 --> 00:20:02,911
But as a direct answer to Aaron's question,

382
00:20:02,991 --> 00:20:07,617
that I do believe that we are going to head

383
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:10,661
into a slightly more, I guess, disposable,

384
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:12,263
we'll call it, experience.

385
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:18,047
for board games and I think it's going to happen more organically than by design and that's mostly because of the state of the market.

386
00:20:18,988 --> 00:20:24,211
What we're talking about before the market is the supply is over is overstepping the

387
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:30,535
is outpacing the demand by a huge amount. We're coming out with more board games, arithmetically more board games every year.

388
00:20:31,115 --> 00:20:35,857
than the year before, and the growth is like 15 to 20 percent per year, which is a great

389
00:20:36,537 --> 00:20:42,358
growth curve by the way, but it's supplies outstripping that. So, we talk a lot among

390
00:20:42,378 --> 00:20:47,720
game designers, we talk about the experience curve of the game, what it is, the lifespan of a game

391
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,881
in everybody's collection from the time they buy it to the time they stop playing it.

392
00:20:52,461 --> 00:21:02,526
And for most people, the fun to work ratio is at its highest in the favor of fun during the early discovery curve of the game.

393
00:21:02,566 --> 00:21:09,669
So, the first two or three games that you play when you're just discovering what the different strategies are, regardless of whether it's a legacy game or a regular game.

394
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:14,813
We're discovering the new strategies, the cause and effect of all the cool mechanics in the game.

395
00:21:15,053 --> 00:21:21,737
Those are by far the highest, where you increase in skill and you increase in understanding the most between sessions.

396
00:21:22,238 --> 00:21:26,661
And that curve almost always flattens, especially with more modern, slightly more procedural games,

397
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:28,802
that flattens very, very quickly.

398
00:21:28,962 --> 00:21:34,386
Four or five games in, you kind of get it, and then you become incrementally better and better over time.

399
00:21:34,746 --> 00:21:38,309
That's much less sexy than moving on to the next game and getting that high of the really...

400
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:44,696
awesome part of the discovery curve. Legacy games are great at that because they're all discovery all the time and

401
00:21:45,077 --> 00:21:46,599
even in we're noticing

402
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:53,086
by trying to even some other games that aren't fully legacy games like mechs versus minions game like the Harry Potter deck building game

403
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,428
freedom of the priest is

404
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,291
FF game, I don't know what they build fruit. They build fruit. Thank you

405
00:21:59,091 --> 00:22:04,636
Where they build discovery elements into the game, even though it looks like by artifice, but it's in there

406
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,277
It's a they're just deck building games that you

407
00:22:07,778 --> 00:22:12,681
Discover new part you unwrap new parts of the content later on you don't change anything. You just unwrap it

408
00:22:13,662 --> 00:22:15,083
because that's a lot more fun.

409
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:17,604
And it also eases the learning curve.

410
00:22:17,944 --> 00:22:20,305
So I believe that we are headed in that direction.

411
00:22:20,745 --> 00:22:23,286
The more successful games will have a slightly more,

412
00:22:24,147 --> 00:22:27,548
will be focused more on first play experience,

413
00:22:27,588 --> 00:22:29,209
first play, second play, third play.

414
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,830
Which disposable games can do much better

415
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:35,412
than other games which have to sandpaper

416
00:22:35,892 --> 00:22:40,034
off a lot of the edge and a lot of the discovery

417
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:41,695
in favor of replayability.

418
00:22:42,383 --> 00:22:46,665
So yeah, I do think so. I think maybe by this time in five years, I would predict that maybe

419
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:50,367
close to 75% of the market will be discoverable games.

420
00:22:50,607 --> 00:22:54,048
Wow, we've got a question patiently waiting on the side for a while now.

421
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:58,713
Yeah, so as I was waiting I came up with other stuff to say.

422
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:04,896
So I wanted to go back to the discussion about Kickstarter versus publishers.

423
00:23:05,116 --> 00:23:10,158
So I've got a background in digital games, I've been currently working on some edible games,

424
00:23:10,198 --> 00:23:14,340
which are tabletop games where you actually eat the game, so it's very much consumable.

425
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:15,201
You're awesome.

426
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:21,865
But so I'm looking for like the next step I'm planning to make a cookbook and like you're

427
00:23:21,885 --> 00:23:26,067
talking about like I don't necessarily have that many people who know me in the board

428
00:23:26,087 --> 00:23:26,848
game world, right?

429
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:32,231
So do I try to approach a publisher or do I go to Kickstarter?

430
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:37,314
Like how, like if somebody who doesn't necessarily have a big name behind them, where do you

431
00:23:37,414 --> 00:23:39,275
recommend people start?

432
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:44,540
I can talk to that at least to start out, which is to me,

433
00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:46,741
the question you should ask

434
00:23:46,781 --> 00:23:48,282
is not about necessarily the name,

435
00:23:48,842 --> 00:23:50,343
but how much work you want to do

436
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:51,723
once you're done with the creation

437
00:23:51,743 --> 00:23:52,764
of this cookbook and the game.

438
00:23:52,804 --> 00:23:55,705
If you want that to be the first 10% of your experience

439
00:23:55,746 --> 00:23:58,687
and then you're doing marketing and PR and booths

440
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:01,969
and logistics and sales tax,

441
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,951
And you really like that, like you like owning a small business.

442
00:24:05,472 --> 00:24:07,494
It's not as exciting to me, but there are people like,

443
00:24:08,054 --> 00:24:12,218
really enjoy the logistics of it, then that's the first question you should ask.

444
00:24:12,258 --> 00:24:15,221
And if you say yes, then you can ask, well, can I succeed at a Kickstarter?

445
00:24:15,582 --> 00:24:19,446
I think too many people are interested in knowing whether they would succeed or not,

446
00:24:19,486 --> 00:24:22,469
or whether it's fun or not, without thinking of how much work they want to do.

447
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:25,271
If you want to write the cookbook and come up with edible games...

448
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:28,913
and then be done and move to the next creative endeavor,

449
00:24:29,013 --> 00:24:30,316
then you want to find a publisher.

450
00:24:30,336 --> 00:24:31,398
And that's the big decision,

451
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:33,181
is how much do you want to do after creation

452
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,504
versus the creation itself?

453
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:39,111
And I'd actually like to add, as a...

454
00:24:40,031 --> 00:24:42,412
You also probably want to ask yourself if you want to be...

455
00:24:44,152 --> 00:24:46,013
What is your victory condition?

456
00:24:46,053 --> 00:24:48,473
Is your victory condition that you get this cool cookbook into the world?

457
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:51,294
Or is your victory condition that you become a game designer?

458
00:24:51,314 --> 00:24:54,214
That you have many more ideas that you want to publish

459
00:24:54,234 --> 00:24:56,155
that you think are viable to publish.

460
00:24:56,595 --> 00:24:58,815
They're two different tracks. They're two very different tracks.

461
00:24:59,876 --> 00:25:02,296
One of which, if you want to do this for a living,

462
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:04,837
if you want to make more games than this,

463
00:25:05,097 --> 00:25:05,217
then...

464
00:25:06,877 --> 00:25:09,038
especially nowadays in an age where there are so many

465
00:25:09,158 --> 00:25:11,179
designers out there that are looking to make a name

466
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:13,980
for themselves, you actually will probably have to focus

467
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:18,582
a little bit more on some of the externalities, right?

468
00:25:18,722 --> 00:25:20,483
Jamie Stegmaier is actually a great example of this.

469
00:25:20,523 --> 00:25:21,383
I don't know, is he here?

470
00:25:21,403 --> 00:25:22,204
I don't think so.

471
00:25:22,664 --> 00:25:23,584
He could run this panel.

472
00:25:23,844 --> 00:25:25,565
Yeah.

473
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:27,506
You're doing a great job, Paul.

474
00:25:27,886 --> 00:25:28,967
Paul.

475
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:29,507
Paul.

476
00:25:29,587 --> 00:25:29,687
Paul.

477
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:36,299
I can mute this microphone and say things

478
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,361
that people won't know, only you'll hear.

479
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:42,382
So build your, part of that, it all boils down

480
00:25:42,402 --> 00:25:43,802
to building yourself into a brand.

481
00:25:43,902 --> 00:25:48,944
Be awesome and be awesome in public.

482
00:25:49,004 --> 00:25:51,525
I mean, that's a career in one sentence.

483
00:25:53,926 --> 00:25:57,347
Start a blog, share your thoughts on game design,

484
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,829
both in the public sphere and in the industry sphere.

485
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:04,770
and build yourself up as a name and a brand

486
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,570
and make sure that every...

487
00:26:06,971 --> 00:26:08,911
focus everything you have on your reputation.

488
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:12,152
Every game you put out, there is an extension of your reputation

489
00:26:12,192 --> 00:26:14,053
and always make sure you're putting out the best game

490
00:26:15,333 --> 00:26:16,253
at any given time.

491
00:26:16,673 --> 00:26:17,393
Which means, of course,

492
00:26:18,774 --> 00:26:21,175
we'll talk about later, throwing out 90% of your stuff.

493
00:26:22,215 --> 00:26:24,115
I want to briefly ask Jeff then,

494
00:26:24,155 --> 00:26:25,616
is this why you don't do this full-time?

495
00:26:25,676 --> 00:26:26,856
Because there would be too much?

496
00:26:26,976 --> 00:26:28,056
Yeah, you know, I...

497
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:33,232
My real business that I actually make money on,

498
00:26:33,272 --> 00:26:35,553
which we can talk about the monetary aspects of it too,

499
00:26:35,613 --> 00:26:38,874
but I have a company that does product manufacturing

500
00:26:39,395 --> 00:26:42,816
and importing and distribution and stuff like that.

501
00:26:42,856 --> 00:26:44,957
That's what I do, so I do that all the time.

502
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:46,297
So for me, when I designed a game,

503
00:26:46,317 --> 00:26:48,058
it would have been very easy to roll that into that

504
00:26:48,118 --> 00:26:50,339
and just find the right factories to do it

505
00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:52,020
and I could handle all the importing and stuff like that.

506
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,460
But I knew I did not.

507
00:26:54,021 --> 00:26:54,501
want to do that.

508
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:57,563
The fun part for me personally was the designing part

509
00:26:58,143 --> 00:27:01,005
and that creative aspect of the engineering of the game

510
00:27:01,045 --> 00:27:03,466
and I didn't want to get involved in all that backend stuff

511
00:27:03,907 --> 00:27:04,587
that Rob was talking about

512
00:27:04,607 --> 00:27:05,848
because I know what's involved in that.

513
00:27:05,888 --> 00:27:08,669
I didn't want to have to go to all the conventions

514
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,891
and be the guy sitting behind the table in the booth

515
00:27:11,151 --> 00:27:12,692
and pushing their product.

516
00:27:12,712 --> 00:27:13,572
And some people are great at that.

517
00:27:13,913 --> 00:27:17,815
Colby Dowch started really small with Summoner Wars.

518
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:20,957
Just I remember him sitting at a little two by six table.

519
00:27:21,477 --> 00:27:24,660
and just pitching it and turned it into a tremendous company,

520
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,761
but I knew that that's not what I wanted,

521
00:27:26,781 --> 00:27:28,582
so you gotta decide what you wanna do.

522
00:27:28,923 --> 00:27:30,284
I will say I like the eating game.

523
00:27:30,744 --> 00:27:32,765
Eating idea is fantastic.

524
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:36,728
There's a game called Attack Vector Tactical,

525
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:38,429
which is insanely complicated,

526
00:27:38,469 --> 00:27:41,371
but the tutorial for it is you put M&Ms all over the board

527
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:42,592
and you fly your spaceship around

528
00:27:42,612 --> 00:27:44,634
and you have to try to shoot the M&Ms

529
00:27:44,694 --> 00:27:46,295
and you get to eat them as the reward.

530
00:27:46,595 --> 00:27:48,316
And that always goes over really, really well

531
00:27:48,336 --> 00:27:49,157
when I'm teaching that game.

532
00:27:49,197 --> 00:27:50,578
That gets people right through the tutorial.

533
00:27:52,168 --> 00:27:53,008
Another question, sir.

534
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,730
You three are exceedingly good at your jobs,

535
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:59,872
and not just once, but over and over and over again.

536
00:27:59,892 --> 00:28:03,274
And I would love to try to figure out why that is.

537
00:28:03,694 --> 00:28:05,395
And my way into that, perhaps, is

538
00:28:05,616 --> 00:28:10,538
I'd love to know, when you go to work as game designer,

539
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:11,879
what is your day?

540
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:12,960
What do you do?

541
00:28:15,221 --> 00:28:16,142
Succinctly.

542
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:18,083
So boring.

543
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:23,810
I'm always at work when people say,

544
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,971
do you get to work from home?

545
00:28:25,031 --> 00:28:27,412
And I say, I have to sleep at the office, right?

546
00:28:27,452 --> 00:28:28,873
So I will talk and I've always got something

547
00:28:28,893 --> 00:28:30,894
in the back of my head or like even walking around here,

548
00:28:30,934 --> 00:28:32,414
there's is constantly turning.

549
00:28:32,514 --> 00:28:35,056
A lot of my day is getting to the end of it

550
00:28:35,196 --> 00:28:37,537
and not getting done 90% of what I thought

551
00:28:37,577 --> 00:28:39,878
I was gonna get done because it's hard to be like perfectly

552
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,019
in the creative zone and not get distracted

553
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:44,000
and not be like, well, I'm gonna start this.

554
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,121
Oh, I got stuck.

555
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:46,241
Well, I'm gonna start something else.

556
00:28:46,281 --> 00:28:48,863
And I got stuck and just keep going around like in a circle.

557
00:28:48,903 --> 00:28:50,984
But mostly it's just.

558
00:28:52,518 --> 00:28:55,360
making something bad and then having the level of comfort

559
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,821
that it's going to get better.

560
00:28:57,461 --> 00:29:01,243
And I think that it really comes down

561
00:29:01,263 --> 00:29:02,604
to stubbornness on my part.

562
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,786
The stubbornness like, no, not good enough,

563
00:29:04,866 --> 00:29:06,246
not good enough, I'll take the time,

564
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,807
I'll stay up late, I'll drive an hour

565
00:29:07,827 --> 00:29:09,168
and playtest it one more time.

566
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,550
Because fear of not paying your bills

567
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,231
is a very strong motivating factor.

568
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:19,913
But I mean, it's spreadsheets, it's graphics,

569
00:29:19,993 --> 00:29:21,815
it's cutting cards, it's play testing,

570
00:29:22,115 --> 00:29:23,937
it's Skype calls with another designer.

571
00:29:24,618 --> 00:29:27,241
When you get to the business aspect of it,

572
00:29:27,381 --> 00:29:29,584
then it's contracts, then it's talking to publishers,

573
00:29:29,624 --> 00:29:32,548
then it's running to the bank and doing things like that.

574
00:29:32,568 --> 00:29:34,069
But if we're talking just pure design,

575
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,132
for me it's sketching.

576
00:29:37,633 --> 00:29:40,755
but I can't sketch, so it's typing and spreadsheets

577
00:29:40,795 --> 00:29:42,996
and moving to the right problem to try to,

578
00:29:43,236 --> 00:29:45,537
the right software to solve the problem you have

579
00:29:45,557 --> 00:29:45,937
at the time.

580
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,678
Like when you, numbers aren't very creative,

581
00:29:48,738 --> 00:29:50,959
but they help in one way, and then you can draw pictures

582
00:29:51,439 --> 00:29:52,960
or get into Illustrator and just make something

583
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,721
look pretty when the numbers don't work.

584
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:57,242
That's just me, and I'm trying to keep it succinct.

585
00:29:58,222 --> 00:30:00,423
I'm sorry, I was not trying to be too snarky.

586
00:30:00,523 --> 00:30:01,143
No, it's fine.

587
00:30:01,703 --> 00:30:03,544
But a day is a long time.

588
00:30:03,564 --> 00:30:04,445
Okay.

589
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:05,945
Or is it a part-time day for you, Jeff?

590
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:08,590
Can you compartmentalize it?

591
00:30:08,871 --> 00:30:12,473
Yeah, I can, although I do a shocking amount of game design during meetings

592
00:30:12,793 --> 00:30:14,114
during the day at my real job.

593
00:30:14,414 --> 00:30:15,295
Wow.

594
00:30:15,595 --> 00:30:18,197
I mean, for me though, the key is that I've got to have

595
00:30:18,957 --> 00:30:23,020
at least like three, four or five different game design projects going on at the same time

596
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,561
because I always run into roadblocks

597
00:30:25,861 --> 00:30:28,683
and the way my brain works is I need to be able to take one thing

598
00:30:28,723 --> 00:30:30,565
and just set it aside and let it lie fallow.

599
00:30:31,085 --> 00:30:34,886
for a day or two or three and have something else to pick up and work on.

600
00:30:35,266 --> 00:30:38,947
And then by the time I run into a Roto-Black on that, something in the back of my brain has said,

601
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:44,368
oh, do this and do that. So that's, if I was just focusing on one game the whole time,

602
00:30:44,388 --> 00:30:47,249
I think it would be very challenging for me. I need that downtime.

603
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,810
Oh, I mean, Rob and Jeff got the procedural parts down very well.

604
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,531
So I guess the only thing I can add is that...

605
00:30:55,127 --> 00:31:00,213
To do this for a living, I've come to the realization a couple of years ago

606
00:31:00,914 --> 00:31:05,879
that game design, at least for me, is of course it's a career, of course it's a job, it's a vocation,

607
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,422
but it's a discipline and it's a point of view.

608
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:11,545
So the discipline is about...

609
00:31:13,047 --> 00:31:16,228
structuring the way you think and the way that you act,

610
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:18,550
view everything through the lens of play.

611
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,332
And there's always, that's that running monologue

612
00:31:22,352 --> 00:31:24,693
at the back of your head in every activity that you do.

613
00:31:24,793 --> 00:31:27,215
So everything, I don't really play games

614
00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:29,116
specifically for inspiration to play other games.

615
00:31:29,136 --> 00:31:31,357
I play them for fun, to make games, I play them for fun.

616
00:31:32,217 --> 00:31:34,519
I go on a walk to get inspired for games.

617
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:37,020
I go travel and talk to smart people like Paul

618
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,041
for it to get inspired for games.

619
00:31:39,502 --> 00:31:40,542
See, I can compliment you too.

620
00:31:42,332 --> 00:31:45,414
But the, and the discipline about it is that

621
00:31:46,815 --> 00:31:50,297
that I have a, I maintain a critical faculty

622
00:31:50,457 --> 00:31:53,459
for every creative endeavor that I both take part in

623
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:56,641
as a consumer and as a creator.

624
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:00,203
And it's just, I spend a lot of time researching.

625
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:01,284
I do panels like this.

626
00:32:01,304 --> 00:32:02,624
I just got a cool idea for a game

627
00:32:02,664 --> 00:32:04,185
talking to Rob a little bit earlier.

628
00:32:05,206 --> 00:32:06,787
You're not getting co-credit for it.

629
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,588
I am, I kept that to yourself.

630
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:16,154
But everything that they told you is true, but you have to you have to filter everything that you

631
00:32:17,155 --> 00:32:20,178
you have everything you think about and basically it has to use up the

632
00:32:20,498 --> 00:32:24,021
Almost the totality of your bandwidth if you want to be doing this full-time

633
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:27,744
You can't really be thinking about anything else and you can't compartmentalize it

634
00:32:29,486 --> 00:32:31,387
As a part of what you who you are

635
00:32:32,348 --> 00:32:32,428
so

636
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:37,522
One thing, you don't have to stand in wait, you can,

637
00:32:38,343 --> 00:32:39,963
is if you're thinking of making games

638
00:32:40,003 --> 00:32:41,083
or doing any creative endeavor,

639
00:32:41,544 --> 00:32:42,904
everyone, there's no right way to do it,

640
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:45,345
but everyone has your, you have your own unique way

641
00:32:45,365 --> 00:32:47,025
that you can probably get unstuck,

642
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:49,326
and when you figure out what that is, go do it.

643
00:32:49,366 --> 00:32:51,527
Like, some people draw and some people write.

644
00:32:51,947 --> 00:32:53,027
I have discovered two things.

645
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:54,668
If I need to solve a deeper problem,

646
00:32:55,228 --> 00:32:59,472
I need to drive where I can't check my phone or do anything and I need to have classical music on

647
00:32:59,492 --> 00:33:03,776
because I'll sing along with regular music and silence is deafening, but classical music fills

648
00:33:03,836 --> 00:33:07,960
it. So driving on the highway for like an hour is a great way to solve like a deeper problem.

649
00:33:09,033 --> 00:33:11,653
When I've got a more like top-level problem that I want to solve,

650
00:33:11,753 --> 00:33:15,554
the best way for me to do it is to try to explain my problem to someone else,

651
00:33:15,614 --> 00:33:17,875
because in the act of explaining it, I don't want to look dumb,

652
00:33:17,935 --> 00:33:20,295
and my brain just fills in some placeholder answer to make...

653
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,816
It's like when you're trying to explain a dream,

654
00:33:22,356 --> 00:33:25,937
and in order to make sense, you sort of change the details to make it into a real story.

655
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,097
I do that when I pitch a game, and I'm like,

656
00:33:28,217 --> 00:33:31,298
no, never mind, I don't need any feedback, my brain just works.

657
00:33:31,318 --> 00:33:33,638
But I can't do that, I almost got a dog, just so I could...

658
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,820
do that, but that seemed like a strange reason to get a pet.

659
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,282
You know what though, that works for me.

660
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:43,425
I do find talking through problems, verbalizing them, somehow does something in your brain.

661
00:33:43,445 --> 00:33:45,046
It finds a different part of your brain.

662
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:49,370
Just talking, sorry, just real quick, just talking about being a full-time game designer or whatever,

663
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:52,872
I mean just in terms of the economics of it, just so you guys know, you know, you...

664
00:33:54,207 --> 00:33:57,809
If a game sells for 50 bucks, the publisher, assuming you're not a publisher yourself,

665
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:01,150
but if the game sells for 50 bucks at retail, the publisher's selling it for $20.

666
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:05,772
You usually get like 5%, 6%. Okay? So you get a buck a game.

667
00:34:06,312 --> 00:34:09,254
Most hobby game print runs are like 5,000 to 10,000 copies.

668
00:34:09,994 --> 00:34:11,655
So you're making $5,000 to $10,000 for the game.

669
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,175
So if you spend a solid year designing a game...

670
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:18,279
you can do the math.

671
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:19,660
That's not necessarily viable.

672
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,021
So you've got to be working on multiple projects and over

673
00:34:22,081 --> 00:34:24,542
time building things up and have a back catalog and things

674
00:34:24,582 --> 00:34:27,003
that will start to give you royalties accruing.

675
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:29,644
Hi.

676
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:35,707
I wanted to ask about the thought process, both from a

677
00:34:35,747 --> 00:34:38,608
business and from a design point of view, when it comes

678
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:43,450
to iterating and expanding on a game that has already

679
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:44,151
released.

680
00:34:46,578 --> 00:34:50,343
The decisions that go into the original design,

681
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:52,085
do you have an idea that you think,

682
00:34:52,386 --> 00:34:54,048
oh, OK, maybe that would be really good

683
00:34:54,088 --> 00:34:57,873
and we put that to the side as a potential expansion

684
00:34:58,234 --> 00:34:58,754
down the road?

685
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:04,282
or make sure that the original game has some good hooks that that'll plug into?

686
00:35:05,382 --> 00:35:07,464
Does it have to do more along the lines of like,

687
00:35:07,624 --> 00:35:09,745
oh, we sold more than we thought we would,

688
00:35:10,105 --> 00:35:15,689
maybe now's a really good time to sit down and think about a way to make it

689
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:17,750
so more players can play it at the same time,

690
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,453
or talk to some people about...

691
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,574
maybe re-theming it or something along the lines.

692
00:35:25,054 --> 00:35:28,715
When do you feel it's worked best for you

693
00:35:29,655 --> 00:35:32,516
to consider adding more components

694
00:35:32,836 --> 00:35:37,958
or keep pushing a project that has succeeded?

695
00:35:37,978 --> 00:35:38,038
Yes.

696
00:35:40,498 --> 00:35:40,818
Yes.

697
00:35:41,419 --> 00:35:41,499
Yes.

698
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:41,579
Yes.

699
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:41,699
Yes.

700
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:41,839
Yes.

701
00:35:41,919 --> 00:35:42,019
Yes.

702
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:42,199
Yes.

703
00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:42,359
Yes.

704
00:35:42,379 --> 00:35:42,439
Yes.

705
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:42,519
Yes.

706
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:42,619
Yes.

707
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:42,699
Yes.

708
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:48,558
So if I can reframe your question, you're asking about the

709
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,480
How do we decide whether a game is expand whether it is expandable?

710
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,761
Do we think about it at the beginning or is that something that generally comes?

711
00:35:57,801 --> 00:36:00,162
later on in the product I

712
00:36:00,242 --> 00:36:01,962
Think I think of all three of us. It's

713
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:11,433
It is really both. Of course everybody wants to design internally, we all want to design the next great lifestyle game,

714
00:36:11,453 --> 00:36:16,174
we want to design the next ticket to ride, the next monopoly, something that can be expanded infinitely,

715
00:36:16,614 --> 00:36:19,375
in infinite ways and make infinite monies.

716
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:29,058
But some games just naturally lend themselves toward a more closed, complete format.

717
00:36:30,618 --> 00:36:38,343
If you're, in my opinion, the more honest you are with the design, the more you just leave it out there with your playtesters.

718
00:36:38,503 --> 00:36:38,703
It will...

719
00:36:41,844 --> 00:36:50,110
organically leads itself to one or the other. You can engineer a closed game to become an expandable game by putting more hooks in, by putting a little bit more complexity in.

720
00:36:51,051 --> 00:36:56,134
Or you can decide, or the publisher can decide for you, we are designing a lifestyle game.

721
00:36:56,855 --> 00:36:59,997
My background is in trading card games and living card games.

722
00:37:00,758 --> 00:37:05,782
So I naturally think in terms of expandability, and most of the games I work on are...

723
00:37:06,622 --> 00:37:11,203
designed to be theoretically infinitely expandable.

724
00:37:12,203 --> 00:37:14,804
So I design usually, the way I do it is design a hook,

725
00:37:16,124 --> 00:37:17,805
a good core game with a really, really,

726
00:37:17,845 --> 00:37:21,566
really solid foundation and theoretically,

727
00:37:22,466 --> 00:37:26,427
theoretically infinite expandable hooks

728
00:37:26,447 --> 00:37:28,447
that I can't necessarily as one designer

729
00:37:28,487 --> 00:37:30,348
that I can't possibly see all ends for.

730
00:37:31,348 --> 00:37:33,688
So that it is not necessarily solvable

731
00:37:35,145 --> 00:37:36,766
If it's not solved by me and my design team,

732
00:37:36,826 --> 00:37:40,048
then it will be not solved in five minutes

733
00:37:40,108 --> 00:37:42,189
by the rest of the internet and the real world.

734
00:37:45,991 --> 00:37:48,132
I think about it, I don't design quite the same way

735
00:37:48,412 --> 00:37:49,753
Eric does, even though he just said it.

736
00:37:50,073 --> 00:37:50,493
No, you don't.

737
00:37:53,155 --> 00:37:54,976
I feel like if you're spending a lot of time

738
00:37:55,016 --> 00:37:56,597
trying to design hooks for expansions

739
00:37:56,657 --> 00:37:58,137
or building your expansions and rolling out

740
00:37:58,157 --> 00:38:00,619
the first six SKUs for this product line,

741
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:03,400
you're gonna be very disappointed when 99% of the time

742
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,541
that it doesn't come to pass.

743
00:38:05,689 --> 00:38:10,171
I feel like when you design a game, most designers put too much in and have to take it out.

744
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:15,153
So you probably have a pile of ideas that are already the start of an expansion.

745
00:38:15,673 --> 00:38:19,775
And if not, if it sort of takes off and suddenly the publisher says,

746
00:38:19,815 --> 00:38:22,997
I think we got a hit, we're going back for our third printing and maybe we should do an expansion,

747
00:38:23,337 --> 00:38:26,398
you probably can find some way to get to it pretty quickly.

748
00:38:27,398 --> 00:38:31,120
Some games won't, and some games I've seen that really strained to do it,

749
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,541
where they've had a success and then they expand, and you're like, you didn't need that.

750
00:38:35,267 --> 00:38:37,709
But if there's a faction, there can be more factions.

751
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:39,410
If there's not a two-player game,

752
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,631
there can be a two-player game.

753
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:42,653
So it's there.

754
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:45,055
I don't spend a lot of time planning for them

755
00:38:45,095 --> 00:38:47,898
because you just don't know what's gonna succeed.

756
00:38:47,918 --> 00:38:49,079
I say that and there's season one

757
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,240
on the front of a game that I did.

758
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,021
But.

759
00:38:52,202 --> 00:38:55,545
So Jeff, I mean, you have done the Space Cadets games.

760
00:38:55,885 --> 00:38:57,286
Yes.

761
00:38:57,847 --> 00:38:58,948
Is that what happened?

762
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:00,549
That you had certain ideas that didn't quite fit

763
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:02,611
in one of the games so they ended up in another?

764
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:09,979
Um, no, actually, um, for when we decided to do the expansions for both Space Cadets and Dice Duel,

765
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:11,780
we really started from scratch.

766
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:12,441
Okay.

767
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:15,902
The stuff that wasn't good enough to make the cut the first time just wasn't.

768
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:17,109
good enough.

769
00:39:17,609 --> 00:39:19,970
We didn't want to try to rehabilitate it and bring it back.

770
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,432
So, yeah, we started from scratch

771
00:39:22,632 --> 00:39:24,413
and designed some new systems and things like that.

772
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:27,295
The only thing we did say was the name for the expansion

773
00:39:27,355 --> 00:39:28,976
for Space Cadets Dice Duel,

774
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:31,157
the alternative name was Diefighter.

775
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:34,279
And I love that name so much,

776
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:35,479
but the publishers didn't have to do it.

777
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:36,460
So when we did an expansion,

778
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,161
I said we have to call it Diefighter.

779
00:39:41,323 --> 00:39:42,443
Please don't clap for puns.

780
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,711
A question.

781
00:39:46,912 --> 00:39:47,132
Yes.

782
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:51,555
Earlier, Aaron Forsythe was asking about the future of potentially disposable games.

783
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:55,278
You also mentioned Kingdom Death, which is a successful but niche game.

784
00:39:55,799 --> 00:40:00,382
And I'm wondering if you could comment on the potential future of niche games themselves

785
00:40:00,502 --> 00:40:03,245
as an alternative to disposable games.

786
00:40:03,825 --> 00:40:08,289
Games that have very small but rabid audiences, or games that are perhaps so expensive that

787
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:11,931
people are sort of coerced into playing them, otherwise they didn't justify the purchase.

788
00:40:15,004 --> 00:40:18,245
I like this question because I've never been asked it and don't have an immediate answer

789
00:40:18,425 --> 00:40:22,487
I mean if you talk about niche meaning a very small audience the question I go back to is say like

790
00:40:23,227 --> 00:40:27,729
Well, why did the publisher make it because if the answer is they just wanted it out there and they didn't care about money

791
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:33,591
Then they're just gonna make the game that they want to play and hopefully there'll be a few hundred people who find it

792
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:38,776
I used to make a joke about the markability and viability of games and say,

793
00:40:38,796 --> 00:40:42,482
like, don't design a game that takes all day and 17 people to play because it'll never catch on.

794
00:40:42,502 --> 00:40:45,286
And then MegaSiv came out and I was like, oh, or it will.

795
00:40:48,264 --> 00:40:50,464
I don't know, with the growth that we're talking about

796
00:40:50,484 --> 00:40:52,125
and the supply growth and the double digit

797
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:53,766
year over year growth, there's going to be games

798
00:40:53,806 --> 00:40:55,846
for everyone coming out and it really comes down

799
00:40:55,886 --> 00:40:57,467
to why the publisher wants to do it.

800
00:40:57,507 --> 00:40:59,408
Is it just, is it to get a wide audience?

801
00:40:59,448 --> 00:41:00,788
Is it to get a specific audience?

802
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:02,609
Is it to take a game that they've played at home

803
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:04,069
for five years and they really love it

804
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:05,450
and they just want a few people to play it

805
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:08,291
so they can sort of pay the bills to go to conventions?

806
00:41:09,791 --> 00:41:11,892
I don't have a clear answer because I think

807
00:41:11,912 --> 00:41:13,753
that there's just so many different reasons

808
00:41:13,773 --> 00:41:16,334
that you would do it, but maybe one of these two people

809
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:17,594
or three people will have a better one.

810
00:41:18,513 --> 00:41:21,694
Well I mean, I think that, of course there will always be niche games, right?

811
00:41:21,714 --> 00:41:28,556
But it's, as Rob said, whether it's intended to be a niche game is a factor.

812
00:41:29,136 --> 00:41:35,498
And, I mean, board games are physical games, so they're always going to be subject to, in economics, the tyranny of objects.

813
00:41:35,598 --> 00:41:36,318
They're always going to be...

814
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:42,091
there are going to be hard manufacturing costs and economy of scale,

815
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:47,273
which you lose once you are printing for a small audience.

816
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:52,094
The manufacturing is getting cheaper, it's getting more automated,

817
00:41:52,174 --> 00:41:57,495
but the marketplace is also becoming a little bit more and more dominated

818
00:41:57,595 --> 00:42:02,856
by big publishers or conglomerated publishers with more economies of scale.

819
00:42:03,316 --> 00:42:06,517
So as long as there is room in the market for...

820
00:42:07,938 --> 00:42:09,679
less career-oriented or less...

821
00:42:11,401 --> 00:42:11,982
It's starting.

822
00:42:13,443 --> 00:42:13,823
Wow.

823
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:16,947
I've been doing that in this room all day. I get used to it.

824
00:42:18,508 --> 00:42:19,809
Or publishers that are a little bit less...

825
00:42:21,531 --> 00:42:22,352
profit-motive...

826
00:42:25,735 --> 00:42:27,056
That's really distracting.

827
00:42:27,076 --> 00:42:31,721
It will happen, but...

828
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:36,652
Again, it depends on... There are a lot of externalities that matter here, right?

829
00:42:36,672 --> 00:42:41,734
A lot of our industry is driven by network externalities.

830
00:42:41,774 --> 00:42:47,516
So gamers meet in game conventions and they meet at game stores, game cafes.

831
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:54,739
The more they remain viable, the more localized small cottage industries will be able to continue making small games.

832
00:42:55,319 --> 00:42:58,500
But they're going to be subjected to those local economies.

833
00:43:00,019 --> 00:43:01,063
Jeff what do you think? Do you agree?

834
00:43:01,645 --> 00:43:03,050
Yeah, well when I was talking about

835
00:43:04,317 --> 00:43:06,098
where the game industry was at a year ago,

836
00:43:06,158 --> 00:43:07,098
or a year and a half ago,

837
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:10,279
I said very strongly that it's definitely a push

838
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,779
towards faster, shorter, simpler games.

839
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,020
Love Letter had just come out and was super popular,

840
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:17,060
and it just seemed like nobody,

841
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,361
before it was like, you know,

842
00:43:18,741 --> 00:43:19,961
when I was growing up, people used to play

843
00:43:20,001 --> 00:43:20,961
three, four hour games,

844
00:43:21,461 --> 00:43:23,202
and then it was like two hour games was normal,

845
00:43:23,482 --> 00:43:25,262
90 minutes, and now it's like if it's over 60 minutes,

846
00:43:25,882 --> 00:43:26,863
nobody wants to look at it.

847
00:43:26,903 --> 00:43:28,543
But at the same time, like you said,

848
00:43:28,563 --> 00:43:29,363
you've got those,

849
00:43:29,383 --> 00:43:31,204
it seems like there's a little pushback now,

850
00:43:31,244 --> 00:43:32,564
and you've got these big,

851
00:43:33,204 --> 00:43:37,507
heavy games that are coming out that are finding a market and are in there.

852
00:43:37,607 --> 00:43:43,930
So I'm interested to see kind of if it's just, you know, going to be pulling on both ends or where that's going to end up.

853
00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:48,433
But I would love to see, I mean, I think in some sense that

854
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:52,775
because of the physicality of board games that there's opportunities that are missed.

855
00:43:52,916 --> 00:43:58,599
I, you know, I would love to be able to do a series of really quick one-off type designs to explore

856
00:43:59,379 --> 00:44:00,481
different issues and things like that,

857
00:44:00,501 --> 00:44:03,084
which I think the video game world does fantastically

858
00:44:04,085 --> 00:44:07,930
to have more like art projects in a way than games.

859
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,312
I'd love to be able to do a quick game about

860
00:44:10,933 --> 00:44:13,676
being a refugee and experiencing life as a refugee

861
00:44:13,716 --> 00:44:15,418
and the choices that you make and things like that.

862
00:44:15,759 --> 00:44:17,621
That's not necessarily gonna be commercially viable.

863
00:44:18,162 --> 00:44:19,263
So you either have to...

864
00:44:19,944 --> 00:44:21,887
make it where it's print and play

865
00:44:21,967 --> 00:44:23,869
or somebody can just blow it out themselves

866
00:44:23,969 --> 00:44:27,675
and just do it, or charge $100 and have it be

867
00:44:27,815 --> 00:44:29,217
like an art project kind of a thing

868
00:44:29,257 --> 00:44:31,400
where it's just a very limited audience.

869
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:34,204
There used to be, with James Earnest,

870
00:44:34,264 --> 00:44:36,086
had his company CheapAssGames.

871
00:44:37,611 --> 00:44:40,133
I don't know if that model could have... I guess there are some people like Button Shy

872
00:44:40,153 --> 00:44:43,375
that are trying to do these things, but they had a subscription service. I used to send

873
00:44:43,395 --> 00:44:47,958
them a check for $50 and then every three or four or five weeks a game would show up

874
00:44:47,998 --> 00:44:51,441
in my mailbox in an envelope and you had to sply your own pawns and money and whatever

875
00:44:51,461 --> 00:44:54,963
and cut the cards out. But there were some fantastic ideas that went through there and

876
00:44:55,483 --> 00:44:58,946
I'd love to see that kind of a model come through as well to allow some of this more

877
00:44:58,986 --> 00:45:00,427
niche stuff to find a home.

878
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,211
So like a lot of people in this room, I'm guessing,

879
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:12,872
I had a job that I hated and I was in a lot of meetings

880
00:45:13,032 --> 00:45:15,573
that went very long and I had paper in front of me

881
00:45:15,773 --> 00:45:18,414
and I decided to try to design a simple game.

882
00:45:18,434 --> 00:45:20,875
And I sort of got to a point where I was obsessed with it,

883
00:45:21,015 --> 00:45:22,316
probably to an unhealthy degree,

884
00:45:22,616 --> 00:45:24,197
and I was forcing my friends to play test it

885
00:45:24,217 --> 00:45:26,357
and it was like actually straining a lot of my friendships.

886
00:45:26,918 --> 00:45:29,339
And so it was really strange.

887
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:31,840
And then, so I kind of like let it drop.

888
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:34,281
due to social pressure mostly, and I was like kind of,

889
00:45:34,581 --> 00:45:37,123
I kind of hit a roadblock like you were describing.

890
00:45:37,483 --> 00:45:39,825
And then now, like a couple weeks ago,

891
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,266
I noticed that there was like a game

892
00:45:41,326 --> 00:45:43,007
that's coming out soon that has a lot of,

893
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,469
it's not the same, but it has a lot of similar ideas

894
00:45:45,529 --> 00:45:48,951
than the game that I was sort of working on half-heartedly.

895
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:51,473
And so I guess I have two questions, which is,

896
00:45:52,093 --> 00:45:53,954
one, how do you deal with like,

897
00:45:54,715 --> 00:46:00,717
people telling you that you probably shouldn't spend so much time on this crazy dream project and

898
00:46:00,937 --> 00:46:05,039
Also the social pressure of like the only people that I have to play with the only people I know who play board games

899
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:11,981
Are also like the friends who I play video games with and they're sick of playtesting this crappy game and to how do you feel?

900
00:46:12,222 --> 00:46:15,143
How do you deal with like I mean you guys probably you know you guys

901
00:46:15,743 --> 00:46:18,284
live and breathe board games, so you have ideas all the time.

902
00:46:18,604 --> 00:46:20,525
So what's it like to have that one idea

903
00:46:20,585 --> 00:46:21,626
tinkling in the back of your head,

904
00:46:21,926 --> 00:46:23,827
you focus on something else, and then six months later,

905
00:46:24,187 --> 00:46:25,528
something very similar comes out, and you go,

906
00:46:25,688 --> 00:46:27,649
oh, I almost had it, you know what I mean?

907
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:31,111
Particularly that latter one, is that a thing

908
00:46:31,351 --> 00:46:33,252
any or all of you have had, I want to ask?

909
00:46:33,672 --> 00:46:35,293
Absolutely. Well, I mean, to speak to number one,

910
00:46:36,273 --> 00:46:37,934
fuck them. Follow your passion.

911
00:46:38,034 --> 00:46:38,194
Wow.

912
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:52,048
Number two, yeah, number two, we've talked about this a lot, actually.

913
00:46:53,509 --> 00:46:55,650
Do you want to tell my insane story?

914
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:01,512
You have so many, I actually don't know which one you mean.

915
00:47:01,632 --> 00:47:03,593
The throwing away of every...

916
00:47:04,413 --> 00:47:06,194
Oh, yeah, you did do that, didn't you?

917
00:47:08,277 --> 00:47:13,846
Eric like last year was putting up on Twitter that he had thrown away all of his prototypes like physically digitally gone

918
00:47:14,306 --> 00:47:18,352
Not set him aside, and I was like he must be speaking metaphorically

919
00:47:18,493 --> 00:47:24,261
And then we were working on a project and we took a Christmas break and we came back and we had spent

920
00:47:25,197 --> 00:47:29,300
Eight months on it, and hours and hours of meetings, and I had flown to Toronto, we had played it,

921
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,701
and I was like, I'm not feeling it.

922
00:47:32,202 --> 00:47:36,164
He's like, me neither, and he was just done, and we threw it away,

923
00:47:37,005 --> 00:47:40,367
and started on something new, and it was actually one of the best decisions we ever made,

924
00:47:40,427 --> 00:47:43,710
because we would have labored and labored to have a game that was like a B-minus,

925
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:48,733
and we just both could see it. I'm not sure that I would have had the bravery to like...

926
00:47:49,816 --> 00:47:53,097
throw it away quite like that, or literally throw things away like you do.

927
00:47:54,417 --> 00:47:55,958
Sometimes it's good to put games on a shelf

928
00:47:56,278 --> 00:48:00,139
and come back to them because you have fresh perspective. Sometimes it's

929
00:48:00,879 --> 00:48:03,820
good to realize that this was a good idea but it's not

930
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:07,841
a good game, at least not now, maybe not ever. And the hard part as a game designer

931
00:48:07,881 --> 00:48:08,521
is figuring out

932
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:09,701
when you're stuck.

933
00:48:10,422 --> 00:48:12,222
versus when it's a bad idea.

934
00:48:12,602 --> 00:48:14,082
Because you're gonna get to that point where

935
00:48:14,362 --> 00:48:15,143
you're stuck and you're like,

936
00:48:15,303 --> 00:48:16,263
I'll just start the next thing

937
00:48:16,283 --> 00:48:17,383
because it's shiny and it's easy

938
00:48:17,403 --> 00:48:18,623
and it doesn't have any problems yet.

939
00:48:18,983 --> 00:48:21,044
And you can keep doing that and you will learn things,

940
00:48:21,084 --> 00:48:22,964
but you'll never learn to get past that first

941
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:24,585
obstacle that you reach.

942
00:48:25,705 --> 00:48:26,645
I've had games I've designed,

943
00:48:26,665 --> 00:48:28,105
I've played games that I get mad

944
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:28,946
because I didn't design them

945
00:48:28,966 --> 00:48:30,446
because it was so obvious in retrospect

946
00:48:30,486 --> 00:48:32,686
and you don't see all the work that went into it.

947
00:48:33,628 --> 00:48:36,970
I've seen games where I had like half an idea and then two years later someone came and

948
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:40,332
was like, yeah that was my idea but they did the work, they did the sweat to do it and

949
00:48:40,372 --> 00:48:41,192
they had it come out.

950
00:48:41,212 --> 00:48:46,696
There are a lot of games that are like a lot of other games and you know, you can still

951
00:48:46,716 --> 00:48:48,577
keep working on a game if it's similar to another game.

952
00:48:48,597 --> 00:48:49,357
Just make it your own.

953
00:48:50,038 --> 00:48:50,518
It'll be different.

954
00:48:51,775 --> 00:48:52,035
Agreed.

955
00:48:52,395 --> 00:48:53,876
Yeah, I wouldn't worry about that.

956
00:48:54,056 --> 00:49:00,541
It's, um, there are, the reality is there's so many games, there's very, very, very few

957
00:49:01,301 --> 00:49:01,822
new ideas.

958
00:49:02,382 --> 00:49:08,566
The chances are almost, you know, it's almost a certainty that the game that you've come

959
00:49:08,626 --> 00:49:12,128
out with that somebody has done something similar at some point, or you're in, you know,

960
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:14,690
you're combining and mixing and matching ideas from other places.

961
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:18,593
So, um, you know, I would just proceed with it.

962
00:49:18,653 --> 00:49:20,954
And, you know, like, like Rob said, if there's...

963
00:49:22,455 --> 00:49:26,476
You know, just if you can put your own twist on it, come out with it, and it still will be fine.

964
00:49:26,916 --> 00:49:28,816
In terms of playtesting, I feel your pain on that.

965
00:49:28,997 --> 00:49:33,398
That's always an issue with a game group of, you know, you have your friends over.

966
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,178
I know Eric has a dedicated playtest game group.

967
00:49:36,218 --> 00:49:40,960
In my situation, I played kind of the long game, and I just had kids.

968
00:49:41,948 --> 00:49:44,050
which ultimately worked out really well.

969
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:45,711
But now they're out of the house.

970
00:49:45,751 --> 00:49:48,553
So that had a narrow window when it worked.

971
00:49:49,214 --> 00:49:50,675
Well, I was gonna say, Jeff,

972
00:49:50,695 --> 00:49:52,616
you said you often have three or four different things

973
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:53,998
going around in your head at the moment.

974
00:49:54,118 --> 00:49:55,499
How long do they sort of live for

975
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:58,401
before they get thrown away metaphorically or literally?

976
00:50:00,787 --> 00:50:05,931
It's variable. I mean, some I'll work on, you know, some I'll work on for a couple months and it'll be obvious that it goes nowhere.

977
00:50:06,432 --> 00:50:15,700
The Fog of War, the first concepts of it were literally 12 years before publication, 14 years before publication I worked on it, before it was finally ready to go.

978
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,320
Wow.

979
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:25,148
And that one, that was a really new idea. I mean, that was something that I was trying to do that had never been done, that had never seen any games that had been done, so it just took a lot of time to wrap my head around it.

980
00:50:27,402 --> 00:50:30,985
Hi, I know a big part of the game design process is like

981
00:50:31,045 --> 00:50:32,506
iterative design and play testing.

982
00:50:32,867 --> 00:50:35,228
So I was just wondering as more play testing tools come

983
00:50:35,268 --> 00:50:40,392
out like on Steam or through other sources, how has play

984
00:50:40,432 --> 00:50:42,354
testing evolved and where do you see that going?

985
00:50:44,089 --> 00:50:48,972
I'm super excited to try like Tabletopia and some of these other tools for playtesting,

986
00:50:49,052 --> 00:50:54,457
especially later round play, later stage playtesting, where you want outside groups to do it,

987
00:50:54,477 --> 00:50:58,760
because that's always a challenge to actually print up sets and get them to testers.

988
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:03,264
And actually, hardest of all is when you send stuff out is to get them to actually get back to you.

989
00:51:03,364 --> 00:51:06,126
You'll go on Twitter and say like, hey, I've got this game to test, can you guys look at it?

990
00:51:06,186 --> 00:51:10,849
And you get a thousand responses and you send them out and maybe two people get back to you.

991
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:16,776
So yeah, I think it's going to be great to be able to actually get groups in there and watch them play

992
00:51:16,816 --> 00:51:19,039
and to be able to interact with people while they're playing the prototype.

993
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:24,646
Surely, were we just saying you had sort of the same playtest groups that you tend to play with?

994
00:51:26,094 --> 00:51:30,739
Yeah, I was just sort of lost in thought a little bit while Jeff was talking in the good way,

995
00:51:30,759 --> 00:51:36,204
because I struck the idea that there probably could be a whole panel about the different stages of playtesting groups and playtest needs.

996
00:51:36,785 --> 00:51:41,109
But the real short version is that it starts out usually I'm playing the game against myself,

997
00:51:41,629 --> 00:51:46,034
and then every step I'm weaning it away, both from me as a player to me being there at all,

998
00:51:46,094 --> 00:51:47,835
to like eventually strangers at the end.

999
00:51:47,875 --> 00:51:49,937
So getting a core playtest group at the beginning.

1000
00:51:50,538 --> 00:51:53,220
who knows game design and is fine playing something broken

1001
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,521
and you changing it in the middle

1002
00:51:54,601 --> 00:51:57,204
and playing the same thing five weeks in a row

1003
00:51:57,244 --> 00:51:59,405
with slight changes is kind of vital.

1004
00:51:59,425 --> 00:52:00,847
You don't want to do that digitally

1005
00:52:00,887 --> 00:52:01,907
or send it out at that point.

1006
00:52:01,988 --> 00:52:03,088
But to Jeff's point at the end,

1007
00:52:03,149 --> 00:52:05,430
you want to just have a group play it

1008
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:06,371
that you don't know at all.

1009
00:52:06,972 --> 00:52:08,033
And you're not there and you can't,

1010
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:09,234
even with your body language be like,

1011
00:52:09,994 --> 00:52:12,516
you, where they know they did something wrong

1012
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:13,837
and then see how that is.

1013
00:52:13,878 --> 00:52:14,378
So there's like.

1014
00:52:15,244 --> 00:52:19,546
probably three or four different playtesting stages that I'm just

1015
00:52:20,167 --> 00:52:22,708
thinking about now, but it's kind of interesting to get back to.

1016
00:52:22,728 --> 00:52:23,928
Oh yeah, it totally could be its own panel.

1017
00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:26,850
I mean, to answer your question, like, where do we see playtesting going?

1018
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:29,831
So one of the big advantages that digital...

1019
00:52:30,792 --> 00:52:38,016
the digital medium has over the over tabletop of course right is real-time analytics and and perfect analytics and

1020
00:52:38,236 --> 00:52:42,758
It's I mean working on dualist for is a joy right because we can

1021
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:49,242
we can spread our testing over thousands and thousands of players and analyze the data in seconds in real time and

1022
00:52:49,502 --> 00:52:55,245
Synthesize that like so quickly. That's it's hard to do in play testing. I actually do I've spent

1023
00:52:56,306 --> 00:53:03,373
A lot of time in many years cultivating a group of about like 100-150 playtesters that we have locally and my wife runs that full-time

1024
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:07,217
So we do cycle through playtesters a lot. That's a it's a big

1025
00:53:07,797 --> 00:53:12,042
I would say it's about a quarter of our day. That's our job, but

1026
00:53:13,543 --> 00:53:20,308
One of the things like Tabletopia and hopefully maybe a little bit more advancement in VR and stuff like that

1027
00:53:20,328 --> 00:53:26,272
is we actually might be able to get as close as we can to transforming blind testing,

1028
00:53:26,312 --> 00:53:31,216
what we used to do with sending games out to groups to play blind,

1029
00:53:31,536 --> 00:53:33,438
but not being able to observe their body language.

1030
00:53:33,458 --> 00:53:36,840
And so we might be able to capture that a little bit better in real time

1031
00:53:37,341 --> 00:53:41,103
and start to be able to run full analytics on that for tabletop games.

1032
00:53:42,067 --> 00:53:44,409
I see that being a reality in like three to four years.

1033
00:53:44,749 --> 00:53:47,110
And I think that'll be, that'll change so much

1034
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:50,852
about the way, in my opinion, that games are designed

1035
00:53:50,892 --> 00:53:55,315
that you'll, I think you'll, right now the minimum bar

1036
00:53:55,455 --> 00:54:00,638
for a tabletop game is that it's not broken, right?

1037
00:54:00,778 --> 00:54:04,200
Which I think that very soon the minimum,

1038
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,401
that won't be a thought anymore.

1039
00:54:06,441 --> 00:54:08,042
The minimum bar for a game is that it's,

1040
00:54:09,558 --> 00:54:16,641
It's it plays. Well. It's fun. It matches its playtime exactly it is fun for all play counts it has multiple

1041
00:54:17,402 --> 00:54:18,222
roads to victory

1042
00:54:19,142 --> 00:54:22,684
That'll be the same minimum bar as not broken is today because of that

1043
00:54:24,925 --> 00:54:27,066
The question here we've got about five or six minutes left

1044
00:54:27,086 --> 00:54:31,668
We can run over a little bit because I think we're the last session after this question

1045
00:54:31,688 --> 00:54:35,850
I'm gonna just jump in and possibly with one of my own as well that I really want to get out

1046
00:54:36,822 --> 00:54:43,484
Thank you. Can you speak about the future of CCG and TCGs, not magic?

1047
00:54:43,504 --> 00:54:44,804
Oh boy.

1048
00:54:44,984 --> 00:54:50,665
And also maybe some of the economy, but not just the economy of it, but the future of it.

1049
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:54,146
I hear you talking about board games, but CCGs?

1050
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:57,766
That's a valid question. I mean, surely they are perennially popular in one form or another.

1051
00:54:59,187 --> 00:55:03,588
Sure. So, I mean, CCGs are...

1052
00:55:05,933 --> 00:55:10,498
I mean, there's still so not I mean you can't talk about CCGs without talking about magic

1053
00:55:10,538 --> 00:55:16,845
Unfortunately, I'll keep it relatively short by magic is it was the first it is still considered by many to be the best they've

1054
00:55:18,698 --> 00:55:22,300
And I'm not just sucking up to the Wizards guys in here, but they do a phenomenal job on it

1055
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,822
and they continually set the bar for design development, but

1056
00:55:26,942 --> 00:55:30,604
there has been a huge renaissance in the development of CCGs with

1057
00:55:31,225 --> 00:55:35,407
notably Hearthstone and many games that followed since I work on a game in that space.

1058
00:55:37,248 --> 00:55:48,518
There is always, they fill a clearly defined and demonstrable need for a perpetually discoverable game that you don't have to throw away pack after pack.

1059
00:55:49,059 --> 00:55:53,903
That has this really cool institutional memory, which is in everybody's collection.

1060
00:55:55,570 --> 00:56:07,300
I don't think that's fundamentally going to change, but they're also the single type of game that is the most subject to this buzzword called network externality,

1061
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:10,582
where the value of the game is equal to the number of players playing it.

1062
00:56:10,643 --> 00:56:16,127
So, sadly speaking, it's not a wide open market.

1063
00:56:16,908 --> 00:56:20,270
It's not something where a whole bunch of indie games can survive.

1064
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:26,373
In any medium where every advance that is made, there is going to be one winner,

1065
00:56:26,393 --> 00:56:28,975
a very, very clear winner that takes a lion's share of the market,

1066
00:56:29,715 --> 00:56:33,738
which will be magic in the real world, in the tabletop world,

1067
00:56:33,778 --> 00:56:38,942
Hearthstone in the digital space, and whatever the new innovation is,

1068
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:40,483
the new medium is in the next space.

1069
00:56:42,564 --> 00:56:44,966
Star Wars Destiny just came out from Fantasy Flight.

1070
00:56:45,006 --> 00:56:46,407
I'm sure a lot of you guys have played it.

1071
00:56:46,747 --> 00:56:47,688
It's cards and dice.

1072
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:59,815
like Dice Masters, but any other game that follows them is going to fall subject to the same thing.

1073
00:57:00,516 --> 00:57:02,077
So I think there will always be...

1074
00:57:03,066 --> 00:57:08,628
something in that space that will always be cheaper and cheaper to obtain for the player,

1075
00:57:08,728 --> 00:57:15,230
because especially as we expand into the parts of the world with a shrinking middle class

1076
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:18,791
or just a burgeoning middle class.

1077
00:57:19,831 --> 00:57:23,753
So I think fundamentally the games won't change,

1078
00:57:23,933 --> 00:57:26,613
but maybe the packaging and business model will a little bit.

1079
00:57:27,387 --> 00:57:29,188
What do you think makes a good CCG?

1080
00:57:29,608 --> 00:57:29,908
I'm sorry?

1081
00:57:30,229 --> 00:57:32,530
What do you think makes a good CCG or what is the...

1082
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,170
That's a good one.

1083
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:35,331
What makes a good...

1084
00:57:35,451 --> 00:57:36,572
What makes a good CCG?

1085
00:57:37,072 --> 00:57:37,932
Richard Garfield.

1086
00:57:38,212 --> 00:57:39,553
Yeah.

1087
00:57:44,275 --> 00:57:44,955
I think we'll...

1088
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:45,636
Sorry, guys.

1089
00:57:45,656 --> 00:57:46,476
Sorry, I...

1090
00:57:46,516 --> 00:57:47,377
It's a long question.

1091
00:57:47,417 --> 00:57:48,217
It's a long answer.

1092
00:57:48,237 --> 00:57:48,937
It's a whole panel of itself.

1093
00:57:48,957 --> 00:57:51,298
It could be a whole panel and I'd love to talk to you about it afterward.

1094
00:57:52,536 --> 00:57:55,038
I think we'll have time to get to the rest of you folks who've come up.

1095
00:57:55,078 --> 00:57:56,819
Thank you all for coming up and asking questions.

1096
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:02,564
I want to throw something at all of you because I am worried that if I don't ask it, nobody else will.

1097
00:58:03,684 --> 00:58:06,887
So we're saying that it's relatively easy to paper a prototype at home.

1098
00:58:06,927 --> 00:58:10,670
It's relatively easy for maybe all of us here to try and make a board game and design a board game

1099
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:15,633
and be a one-time board game designer or occasionally a board game designer

1100
00:58:15,653 --> 00:58:20,777
or a successful board game designer if our work is good enough, if our ideas are smart enough.

1101
00:58:21,617 --> 00:58:29,639
So why are we just four guys stood up here, and why am I only meeting guy game designers pretty much all the time wherever I go?

1102
00:58:29,659 --> 00:58:33,000
I don't know.

1103
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:40,342
You know, I think it's a problem. I think that it's something that hopefully will, you know, I think part of it was just that...

1104
00:58:41,381 --> 00:58:45,765
I think that the current group of game designers kind of came out of, you know, game design

1105
00:58:45,805 --> 00:58:50,109
in the 80s and the 90s when it was more, you know, D&D and cosmic encounter and stuff like

1106
00:58:50,149 --> 00:58:53,252
that that didn't attract women as much at that time.

1107
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:58,036
So I think there's just sort of that class that kind of grew up.

1108
00:58:58,783 --> 00:59:01,124
I'm hoping that it changes.

1109
00:59:02,025 --> 00:59:05,587
My daughter, Sydney, co-designed a bunch of games with me

1110
00:59:05,687 --> 00:59:10,410
and it was, I think that I was very proud of that

1111
00:59:10,470 --> 00:59:12,231
and she's done a great job with that

1112
00:59:12,271 --> 00:59:13,512
and brought a whole different perspective

1113
00:59:13,552 --> 00:59:14,132
on a lot of stuff.

1114
00:59:14,172 --> 00:59:17,274
So I'm hoping that it's gonna just be something

1115
00:59:17,414 --> 00:59:18,275
that will take.

1116
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:23,115
time to do it. I don't feel like there's necessarily a bias against

1117
00:59:23,996 --> 00:59:27,357
women coming and pitching a game that would be turned away versus other ones.

1118
00:59:27,377 --> 00:59:32,720
I'm just hoping that it's just because of the nature of the early 70s and 80s gaming

1119
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,042
and that culture that it's kind of a hangover in essence from that.

1120
00:59:37,183 --> 00:59:37,623
Do we agree?

1121
00:59:40,017 --> 00:59:41,519
I guess this is the part where I get in trouble.

1122
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:47,744
I mean, I do believe we are absolutely institutionally biased and sexist.

1123
00:59:48,305 --> 00:59:49,546
It's not purposeful, but it...

1124
00:59:52,667 --> 00:59:57,888
something that we need to get better at, and a lot of us speak pretty loudly about it.

1125
00:59:58,529 --> 01:00:03,510
We're not particularly welcoming to women and minorities in gaming,

1126
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:08,591
because it's just not something that comes up in conversation often enough.

1127
01:00:10,691 --> 01:00:12,312
I screw up still, all the time.

1128
01:00:14,032 --> 01:00:22,174
We make games where we still casually put one-sided cheesecake into a game art,

1129
01:00:23,514 --> 01:00:28,396
We're still a little bit too objectifying toward women as we are toward men.

1130
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:33,038
Part of this, in my opinion, we don't have enough women in game design.

1131
01:00:34,878 --> 01:00:41,100
It can't possibly be because women aren't interested in game design.

1132
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:45,722
If you look at the marketing data for mobile games, over half of it is women.

1133
01:00:47,632 --> 01:00:53,037
We're all creative people. Almost like we said before, in every gamer is a game designer.

1134
01:00:53,097 --> 01:00:59,742
So the same number of women must be creative and want to get into the game design business.

1135
01:01:00,203 --> 01:01:06,028
It is mostly up to us to be more inviting for women to become game designers.

1136
01:01:06,368 --> 01:01:07,989
In my opinion, we have to do it from the top down.

1137
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:12,031
It's not like we should say, more women should come up and design games.

1138
01:01:12,271 --> 01:01:13,572
No, we have to be more welcoming.

1139
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,872
It's a long and ongoing conversation,

1140
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:19,054
but it is the burden of that falls on us,

1141
01:01:19,774 --> 01:01:21,034
rather than on women.

1142
01:01:21,554 --> 01:01:22,055
If that makes sense.

1143
01:01:24,195 --> 01:01:27,437
I agree with some combination of what they've said,

1144
01:01:27,457 --> 01:01:30,838
and in order to keep things short, I'll just add a couple new points,

1145
01:01:30,878 --> 01:01:33,979
which is I've taught game design at two different colleges

1146
01:01:34,819 --> 01:01:36,860
over the past couple years, and I've been encouraged to see

1147
01:01:38,234 --> 01:01:40,817
almost half of my students have been women,

1148
01:01:40,837 --> 01:01:41,878
where I think that, you know, so like,

1149
01:01:41,918 --> 01:01:44,220
it looks like this next generation is seeking it out

1150
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,622
and getting the opportunities.

1151
01:01:46,382 --> 01:01:48,425
And so I think hopefully there's some sort of

1152
01:01:49,065 --> 01:01:51,267
change happening at the bottom as well as happening top,

1153
01:01:51,308 --> 01:01:52,489
and they get the opportunities.

1154
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:55,112
you know, when they're looking for jobs.

1155
01:01:55,172 --> 01:01:56,914
But I mean, it's still there as an underlying thing.

1156
01:01:57,115 --> 01:01:58,396
I work full time with my wife.

1157
01:01:58,436 --> 01:01:59,998
She's an art director, graphic designer,

1158
01:02:00,018 --> 01:02:00,859
and a hardcore gamer.

1159
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,002
And it still cracks me up when we will sit down

1160
01:02:03,042 --> 01:02:04,464
and someone will teach a game to the two of us

1161
01:02:04,524 --> 01:02:06,186
and assume that I'm going to crush them.

1162
01:02:06,707 --> 01:02:08,229
And she always wins.

1163
01:02:09,524 --> 01:02:12,206
and I never win, and they just don't see it coming.

1164
01:02:12,626 --> 01:02:15,429
You can tell they're always kind of like a little bit like,

1165
01:02:15,489 --> 01:02:16,430
a girl just beat me.

1166
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:19,112
Like it's this weird thing that's just ingrained

1167
01:02:19,172 --> 01:02:21,254
at a level that is not out yet,

1168
01:02:21,274 --> 01:02:23,356
but I'm hoping every incident and every change

1169
01:02:23,396 --> 01:02:26,299
and every student, every person starts adding up

1170
01:02:26,339 --> 01:02:27,800
to a larger change.

1171
01:02:28,701 --> 01:02:30,521
How do we help get that out? How do we help change it?

1172
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:33,383
Because we're the people on the stage here right now talking about this

1173
01:02:33,903 --> 01:02:35,904
and who are going to be on film and watched later.

1174
01:02:36,184 --> 01:02:38,105
So we're pretty much at the top of that, right?

1175
01:02:38,345 --> 01:02:42,708
Well, step one, any women in the audience interested in being game designers for a living?

1176
01:02:44,076 --> 01:02:45,357
Come talk to me in five minutes.

1177
01:02:45,597 --> 01:02:45,898
Come talk.

1178
01:02:46,919 --> 01:02:49,081
Yeah, I mean, there's things, I'm part of Restoration Games,

1179
01:02:49,101 --> 01:02:50,322
and we're doing a game which is, you know,

1180
01:02:50,342 --> 01:02:51,943
I know there's a cutting edge theme,

1181
01:02:51,963 --> 01:02:54,165
but we talked about, we put it in the Italian Renaissance.

1182
01:02:55,326 --> 01:02:56,207
It just works there.

1183
01:02:56,868 --> 01:02:58,670
But, you know, so it should be like the Medici's,

1184
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:02,493
and they should be all just white guys on the card art.

1185
01:03:02,673 --> 01:03:04,135
And we just decided, we put in the book like.

1186
01:03:04,715 --> 01:03:05,776
This is not a history book.

1187
01:03:05,836 --> 01:03:09,079
So there's Asian people and people of color

1188
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:11,100
and women and older people and younger people

1189
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:11,941
and all body types.

1190
01:03:11,981 --> 01:03:13,902
And so like the company that I have an active say,

1191
01:03:13,922 --> 01:03:15,603
I'm just like, no, we're kind of showing

1192
01:03:15,643 --> 01:03:16,744
a cross section of the world,

1193
01:03:17,144 --> 01:03:18,746
even if it's not historically accurate.

1194
01:03:19,246 --> 01:03:21,548
Which I think no one would have thought of 20 years ago

1195
01:03:21,988 --> 01:03:23,409
and may have thought of 10 years ago and said,

1196
01:03:23,429 --> 01:03:25,531
yeah, but we can't do that because it's not right.

1197
01:03:25,571 --> 01:03:29,053
So I'm trying to do it where I can

1198
01:03:29,093 --> 01:03:30,654
in terms of least portrayal and things.

1199
01:03:30,694 --> 01:03:33,696
But yeah, like Eric said, if, you know, see me, see us.

1200
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:38,603
try to help. A question. Yes.

1201
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:42,807
I have a question about accessibility in board games.

1202
01:03:43,207 --> 01:03:47,030
I play with a colour blind board gamer and why am I still

1203
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:49,092
sticking dots on the red cubes?

1204
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:55,110
What a good question. Some of my favorite video game designers are actually colorblind, and some of them have started...

1205
01:03:56,131 --> 01:04:00,574
You know, it's very easy to modify video games to do this. It doesn't seem to be a thing in board games.

1206
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:04,977
It does, we just suck at it right now. We're getting better. We really are.

1207
01:04:05,037 --> 01:04:06,118
Like, it is a...

1208
01:04:07,979 --> 01:04:10,301
Especially among some of the bigger publishers, a lot of us...

1209
01:04:11,622 --> 01:04:15,965
We have a pretty good checklist of development before we put a game out.

1210
01:04:17,277 --> 01:04:17,757
out the door.

1211
01:04:18,257 --> 01:04:20,497
And this checklist is expanding

1212
01:04:20,777 --> 01:04:23,718
and in good ways, in positive ways in my opinion,

1213
01:04:23,758 --> 01:04:26,038
but generally it takes a mistake

1214
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:28,699
to add something to that checklist.

1215
01:04:28,819 --> 01:04:31,939
And colorblind accessibility,

1216
01:04:33,019 --> 01:04:35,140
haptic accessibility for blind players,

1217
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:37,700
those are both items that are on the checklist

1218
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:38,840
for more and more games,

1219
01:04:39,561 --> 01:04:40,861
if we can possibly help it.

1220
01:04:41,621 --> 01:04:43,401
We recently, with Blood Rage,

1221
01:04:43,441 --> 01:04:44,361
we totally screwed up.

1222
01:04:45,786 --> 01:04:47,467
like publicly admitted no problem.

1223
01:04:47,487 --> 01:04:50,049
Like we put, we had a really bad color scheme

1224
01:04:50,069 --> 01:04:53,451
and it was pointed out to us by players with,

1225
01:04:53,911 --> 01:04:55,713
none of our play testers played with final components

1226
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:57,914
and was pointed out to us.

1227
01:04:57,974 --> 01:05:00,596
And now it is on the checklist for every single,

1228
01:05:01,116 --> 01:05:03,538
for every single game that we do on the Pantone scale

1229
01:05:03,578 --> 01:05:05,079
to make sure that it does not trigger

1230
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:08,001
the most common types of color blindness.

1231
01:05:08,341 --> 01:05:09,102
We'll never be perfect,

1232
01:05:09,142 --> 01:05:11,083
but we're getting there, hopefully.

1233
01:05:11,103 --> 01:05:13,565
It's a.

1234
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:17,191
I had a question about gameplay versus theme.

1235
01:05:17,231 --> 01:05:19,152
When you guys are developing a new game, do you guys

1236
01:05:19,612 --> 01:05:22,314
typically think about new gameplay mechanisms, or game

1237
01:05:22,354 --> 01:05:24,775
mechanics, or how to merge existing mechanics?

1238
01:05:24,855 --> 01:05:28,357
Or do you come up with a theme and then try to match

1239
01:05:28,417 --> 01:05:30,479
mechanics to it, and then kind of a follow up?

1240
01:05:31,339 --> 01:05:33,060
Have we reached peak Cthulhu yet?

1241
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:35,241
Because it seems like everything wrong.

1242
01:05:35,281 --> 01:05:36,722
No, no, there's no peak Cthulhu.

1243
01:05:36,802 --> 01:05:38,343
It's Cthulhu all the way down.

1244
01:05:38,423 --> 01:05:39,464
Always room for Cthulhu.

1245
01:05:39,804 --> 01:05:41,485
Cthulhu is the ice cream of gaming.

1246
01:05:44,238 --> 01:05:46,139
I will tell you, it's always a little bit different.

1247
01:05:46,759 --> 01:05:47,940
Every designer's gonna tell you different.

1248
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,300
Every time I work on a project's different.

1249
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:52,082
I tend to do mechanics or mechanisms later,

1250
01:05:52,142 --> 01:05:52,882
but not always.

1251
01:05:53,842 --> 01:05:55,203
Sometimes it's theme or story.

1252
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:57,424
Sometimes it's an emotional experience that I wanna get.

1253
01:05:57,484 --> 01:05:59,345
Sometimes I'm inspired by something way out.

1254
01:05:59,385 --> 01:06:01,086
I tend to be inspired outside of gaming

1255
01:06:01,106 --> 01:06:03,427
and then use gaming tools to make it a game.

1256
01:06:05,008 --> 01:06:07,230
So I might be inspired by television or,

1257
01:06:07,890 --> 01:06:09,151
like my daughter goes off to college,

1258
01:06:09,191 --> 01:06:10,352
my first child this fall, and so like,

1259
01:06:10,432 --> 01:06:11,793
what's that feel like?

1260
01:06:11,973 --> 01:06:13,334
And is there a game in that feeling?

1261
01:06:13,354 --> 01:06:14,295
The answer is probably no.

1262
01:06:15,716 --> 01:06:17,157
But like, that's like an interesting,

1263
01:06:17,177 --> 01:06:18,899
like how do I get people to an emotional space

1264
01:06:18,979 --> 01:06:19,899
or something like that?

1265
01:06:19,919 --> 01:06:22,161
So the inspiration comes from all different places,

1266
01:06:22,241 --> 01:06:25,424
but Susan McKinley Ross, I don't know if she's here,

1267
01:06:25,464 --> 01:06:26,765
but she did Quirkle and she talks about

1268
01:06:26,825 --> 01:06:28,486
how she does mechanics.

1269
01:06:29,429 --> 01:06:30,790
And most of our games are abstract.

1270
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:32,831
And if I do an abstract game,

1271
01:06:33,571 --> 01:06:35,072
as soon as I hit my first sticking point,

1272
01:06:35,272 --> 01:06:36,433
I need to put a theme on it to figure out

1273
01:06:36,453 --> 01:06:37,153
how to get unstuck.

1274
01:06:37,173 --> 01:06:38,514
So it differs from people.

1275
01:06:39,274 --> 01:06:39,834
Jeff, you gonna?

1276
01:06:39,854 --> 01:06:40,695
I have a few.

1277
01:06:40,975 --> 01:06:43,396
Very much, I teach this to my class.

1278
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:45,237
This is the very first class that we do

1279
01:06:45,457 --> 01:06:46,718
is experience first.

1280
01:06:46,778 --> 01:06:48,859
It's not mechanics, it's not theme, it's experience.

1281
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:50,139
You know, it's real easy to say

1282
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:51,320
I'm gonna do a zombie game,

1283
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:53,521
which is the Cthulhu of two years ago, I guess.

1284
01:06:54,562 --> 01:06:57,124
But, you know, are you going to be an entire nation fighting off zombies?

1285
01:06:57,144 --> 01:06:59,005
Are you just going to be trapped in a mall?

1286
01:06:59,185 --> 01:07:03,709
You know, you've got to get to that experience, what I call the experience or the emotional core.

1287
01:07:04,089 --> 01:07:08,613
And I think that's what really carries you through, even if you end up totally changing the theme later,

1288
01:07:09,093 --> 01:07:11,976
if you've got that experience, or another way to look at it,

1289
01:07:12,056 --> 01:07:14,998
is the story that you want the players to tell when they're done.

1290
01:07:17,439 --> 01:07:21,911
Interesting. Player perspective, the end goal maybe rather than the start goal.

1291
01:07:22,412 --> 01:07:23,134
Thinking backwards.

1292
01:07:23,555 --> 01:07:23,716
Right.

1293
01:07:27,187 --> 01:07:28,048
Hi, thanks for the talk.

1294
01:07:28,068 --> 01:07:29,748
Thanks for sticking around to answer the last question.

1295
01:07:29,789 --> 01:07:31,589
So I was kind of inspired.

1296
01:07:31,629 --> 01:07:33,050
My question changed as I stood in line

1297
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,370
by the question about diversity.

1298
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:37,192
I was curious to learn a little bit more

1299
01:07:37,272 --> 01:07:40,013
about the development team behind a board game.

1300
01:07:40,033 --> 01:07:42,714
Because often you see like the designer's name on the box.

1301
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:44,855
I assume that's like the main guy

1302
01:07:44,875 --> 01:07:45,915
and that's all of you guys, right?

1303
01:07:45,935 --> 01:07:47,256
It's only the designer, that's it.

1304
01:07:47,882 --> 01:07:50,103
All right, well I'm wondering, you know,

1305
01:07:50,303 --> 01:07:52,524
my wife was not a gamer, she didn't grow up a gamer,

1306
01:07:52,584 --> 01:07:54,585
she's recently started playing board games with me,

1307
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:56,405
but there aren't a lot of themes that appeal to her,

1308
01:07:56,485 --> 01:07:57,946
you know, in the same way that they appeal to me.

1309
01:07:58,506 --> 01:08:02,047
I'm wondering if that's because teams are not as diverse,

1310
01:08:02,067 --> 01:08:04,688
like video games require these huge collaborative efforts,

1311
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:07,349
whereas board games can be kind of one guy's idea

1312
01:08:07,629 --> 01:08:08,230
all the way through.

1313
01:08:08,550 --> 01:08:10,070
And is there more that we could maybe be doing

1314
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:13,692
to diversify the development teams behind board games

1315
01:08:13,752 --> 01:08:15,092
to get those new perspectives in?

1316
01:08:16,733 --> 01:08:16,873
Yep.

1317
01:08:18,052 --> 01:08:18,533
Oh, okay, cool.

1318
01:08:18,633 --> 01:08:23,296
Yeah, but it's always going to be, they're going to, I mean, board game design, I think

1319
01:08:23,316 --> 01:08:27,239
just by its nature, both the economics of it and the way that it's done is always going

1320
01:08:27,259 --> 01:08:28,139
to be smaller teams.

1321
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:31,182
So it's, you'd have to really make sure that you had it built in.

1322
01:08:31,202 --> 01:08:34,564
I, you know, I cracked up during the early, the Mechs and Minions.

1323
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:38,231
presentation was given and his last slide was like,

1324
01:08:38,611 --> 01:08:40,972
you know, we had such a small team working on this game

1325
01:08:41,012 --> 01:08:42,812
and they show a picture of like 15 people

1326
01:08:43,533 --> 01:08:45,774
that all contributed and I'm like, you know,

1327
01:08:45,934 --> 01:08:48,074
I've never been involved with more than three people

1328
01:08:48,154 --> 01:08:49,835
developing a game, so this would be like

1329
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:52,136
a huge, massive project, even like Fantasy Flight

1330
01:08:52,156 --> 01:08:53,757
and stuff like that, you know, they have maybe,

1331
01:08:54,217 --> 01:08:55,817
you know, five, six, seven, eight people,

1332
01:08:55,938 --> 01:08:58,459
so it's not done on the same kind of scale,

1333
01:08:58,519 --> 01:09:00,139
but yeah, I mean, if you bring in other voices

1334
01:09:00,199 --> 01:09:02,800
and other people, that's gonna help diversify it.

1335
01:09:03,792 --> 01:09:08,696
Well, as board games become bigger budget, and this is happening actually at Fantasy Flight, this is happening too,

1336
01:09:09,136 --> 01:09:10,457
there is a little bit of a cultural shift.

1337
01:09:10,877 --> 01:09:13,939
So, I mean, of course, the designer is the person that gets their name on the box,

1338
01:09:14,019 --> 01:09:18,162
because we're fragile creatures with egos that need constant attention.

1339
01:09:19,383 --> 01:09:24,808
I mean, of course, there's behind every board game. There's a development team, an art director, artists, a producer

1340
01:09:25,649 --> 01:09:31,874
and on the flip side, there's a sales team, marketing team, etc, etc, but

1341
01:09:32,795 --> 01:09:37,720
I was actually inspired about 15 years ago or so and I teach this to every single team that I work with on the board

1342
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:41,303
game side. I was inspired by the way that Wizards of the Coast defines

1343
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:46,607
design and development, which could be a panel in and of itself.

1344
01:09:47,188 --> 01:09:49,710
And I'm slightly redefining it, so I apologize if I was revert.

1345
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:55,735
But design and development, we're essentially beginning and end, for all intents and purposes.

1346
01:09:55,835 --> 01:09:59,518
It's a Venn diagram of skill sets that is very, very...

1347
01:10:00,539 --> 01:10:02,039
That's a high degree of overlap.

1348
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,700
But the development team is,

1349
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:07,321
the development team is, sorry,

1350
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:09,181
designer is essentially responsible

1351
01:10:09,201 --> 01:10:10,061
for the vision of the game.

1352
01:10:10,101 --> 01:10:13,642
They're the ones with whom the idea is born,

1353
01:10:14,082 --> 01:10:16,083
and they have to, it's their responsibility

1354
01:10:16,103 --> 01:10:18,183
to execute on the idea and make a game

1355
01:10:18,243 --> 01:10:19,624
and be responsible for the vision.

1356
01:10:19,964 --> 01:10:22,984
Development team being responsible for carrying the vision,

1357
01:10:23,044 --> 01:10:24,945
taking another set of eyes to that viewpoint

1358
01:10:25,005 --> 01:10:27,185
and matching the actual experience

1359
01:10:27,225 --> 01:10:29,106
in a multitude of different.

1360
01:10:30,487 --> 01:10:32,109
environments to match that vision.

1361
01:10:33,530 --> 01:10:35,172
The board game teams are becoming bigger.

1362
01:10:35,973 --> 01:10:37,655
They are, like even Fantasy Flight now,

1363
01:10:37,695 --> 01:10:40,898
they generally have agile teams, about two or three people,

1364
01:10:41,959 --> 01:10:43,521
that work on every different game.

1365
01:10:43,541 --> 01:10:45,883
So there's usually a lead person, which is the designer,

1366
01:10:46,204 --> 01:10:48,346
but there's a back-end development team where somebody,

1367
01:10:49,047 --> 01:10:51,409
besides the designer, has final call on certain things.

1368
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,921
The answer to your question, how we diversify that,

1369
01:10:54,961 --> 01:10:56,221
the same way we diversify everything else.

1370
01:10:56,301 --> 01:10:59,643
Just bring more people into the industry,

1371
01:10:59,683 --> 01:11:00,863
make the industry more appealing

1372
01:11:00,903 --> 01:11:03,304
for more different people with different perspectives,

1373
01:11:03,764 --> 01:11:05,785
and let them fall where their talents lay

1374
01:11:05,865 --> 01:11:08,346
rather than where we want to engineer to put them.

1375
01:11:08,626 --> 01:11:12,348
Right, and I guess that's kind of the quick follow-up, right, is if the reason there aren't

1376
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:15,670
that many women in is because you have this generation of men who played D&D growing up

1377
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:18,771
and becoming designers, do you then now have the same problem where you have the generation

1378
01:11:18,791 --> 01:11:22,453
of men playing the games made by the men who played D&D and you don't ever get that new

1379
01:11:22,514 --> 01:11:22,974
sort of inroad?

1380
01:11:22,994 --> 01:11:24,214
At some point you have to break the cycle.

1381
01:11:24,395 --> 01:11:24,595
Yeah.

1382
01:11:24,755 --> 01:11:25,915
But I've been super gratified.

1383
01:11:25,935 --> 01:11:29,017
I mean, I went to Origins 3 in 1978, right, and it was like 100%.

1384
01:11:31,899 --> 01:11:36,244
guys and even you know in the 80s and 90s and now if I go to Gen Con or I go

1385
01:11:36,284 --> 01:11:40,369
to our local game conventions it's usually you know pretty close to 50-50

1386
01:11:40,409 --> 01:11:43,793
women men and I know that there's issues and there's you know behaviors which

1387
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:47,297
are not acceptable things like that but in general it's so much different now

1388
01:11:47,317 --> 01:11:49,861
the culture of board gaming than it was back in the 80s.

1389
01:11:51,064 --> 01:11:54,850
I think we will have to take the rest of the questions outside if you folks don't mind

1390
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:58,055
doing that because I'm sure the panel are nice enough that they would do that.

1391
01:11:58,376 --> 01:12:01,581
Thank you everyone for coming and for your questions.
