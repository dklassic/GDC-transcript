1
00:00:07,211 --> 00:00:09,153
I'm hoping I'm on. It sounds like I'm on.

2
00:00:10,794 --> 00:00:14,297
Lovely to see you all. Thank you very, very much for making

3
00:00:15,117 --> 00:00:19,521
the inexplicable and possibly ill-advised choice of

4
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:23,144
starting your GDC with the talk about death.

5
00:00:25,606 --> 00:00:28,368
I appreciate it more than I can say, so thank you very much.

6
00:00:30,622 --> 00:00:33,062
because that is what I'm here to talk about.

7
00:00:33,162 --> 00:00:35,803
So I call this the gamification of death,

8
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:38,044
partly because I'm a little bit of a troll,

9
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,725
and partly because I couldn't think of anything better.

10
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:42,725
But I should probably say up front,

11
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:46,286
I'm talking here about gamification, not

12
00:00:46,606 --> 00:00:48,067
air quotes gamification.

13
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:52,028
And I don't really want to get bogged down into that debate.

14
00:00:52,088 --> 00:00:53,869
I think it's already unfolded quite interestingly

15
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:56,089
at various of the summits earlier this week.

16
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:01,279
But I think it is worth just making that distinction

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,142
between a process of trying to make something

18
00:01:05,262 --> 00:01:07,484
into a meaningful game, into something that operates

19
00:01:07,504 --> 00:01:09,645
in the way that we understand games work,

20
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:11,486
with risk and rewards and objects and constraints

21
00:01:11,526 --> 00:01:13,808
and whatever particular definition you best like

22
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:17,090
as your definition of a game, and the other equally

23
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,671
interesting but different process

24
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:20,413
of using some of the language of games,

25
00:01:20,433 --> 00:01:21,854
some of the furniture and paraphernalia

26
00:01:21,894 --> 00:01:23,475
in terms of point structures and badges

27
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:26,096
to apply to other circumstances.

28
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:32,304
And both are interesting, but what I want to talk about today is the first one, is about

29
00:01:32,324 --> 00:01:35,626
this process of trying to make something real into a real game.

30
00:01:35,886 --> 00:01:38,928
So I'm going on the no air quotes front.

31
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:41,150
And the thing I was trying to make into a game was death.

32
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:48,155
And I and my team at Hide and Seek have spent on and off quite a lot of the last 18 months

33
00:01:48,195 --> 00:01:51,417
working on a project about death.

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,162
uh, from which we learned a lot, uh, and I wanted to come and,

35
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:59,843
uh, share that with you guys here. And this being GDC, I

36
00:01:59,883 --> 00:02:02,484
thought I should do that in the format of takeaways, because we

37
00:02:02,524 --> 00:02:05,605
all love a takeaway. That means something quite different in the

38
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:08,386
UK, you know, it really skews our perspective of this whole

39
00:02:08,426 --> 00:02:12,307
event. Um, but yeah, I wanted to share my takeaways from that

40
00:02:12,427 --> 00:02:16,289
year and a half of working on, uh, A Game About Death. And so

41
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:20,750
these were my kind of top three takeaways. Uh,

42
00:02:22,187 --> 00:02:23,189
was pretty much it.

43
00:02:24,892 --> 00:02:26,335
It was a hard year and a half.

44
00:02:29,196 --> 00:02:32,957
And I did tell you you were coming to a thing about death,

45
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:35,277
and I'm sorry that this is how your day starts.

46
00:02:35,717 --> 00:02:38,818
And it may sound like a major overstatement, right?

47
00:02:39,558 --> 00:02:41,859
Games about death, not that hard.

48
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,799
Games have a lot of death in them.

49
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,920
We've all seen and played, and some of us

50
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,541
have made probably really interesting projects, game

51
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:51,161
projects, proper game projects about death,

52
00:02:51,201 --> 00:02:54,802
whether some of Eric Zimmerman's early game design challenge

53
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,302
sessions, or playing Passage, or The Path,

54
00:02:57,322 --> 00:02:58,383
or whatever it is that you.

55
00:02:59,383 --> 00:03:01,344
go to in your head when somebody says games about death.

56
00:03:01,404 --> 00:03:05,925
So why did this drive me to the brink of my takeaway slide

57
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:07,246
when it seems quite straightforward?

58
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,427
So it's worth saying that this isn't really

59
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:11,968
a project about death.

60
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,009
It's a project about a death.

61
00:03:14,289 --> 00:03:17,130
And that turns out to be a much harder thing.

62
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:22,532
So this was a project that was based around this film,

63
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:23,913
a film called Dreams of a Life.

64
00:03:24,393 --> 00:03:25,893
And this film.

65
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:32,271
tells a story that I still struggle to tell,

66
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:40,476
about the discovery of the body of a woman named Joyce Vincent,

67
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:45,679
dead in her North London flat in 2005.

68
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,121
She was found by the bailiffs, who

69
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:53,004
had broken in because of a buildup of unpaid electricity

70
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:53,324
bills.

71
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:57,506
And they found not her, but her skeleton.

72
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:03,463
she'd been lying there for nearly three years. Despite the unpaid bills, the electricity

73
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:09,926
had remained on, so for that entire period, her television had been on. Um, broadcasting

74
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:16,689
BBC One for all of that time. Um, her neighbours didn't know her, no one had ever reported

75
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:21,891
her missing. Um, in the end, she was only identified, or formally identified,

76
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:28,374
by comparing her teeth against holiday photos that they found

77
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:31,356
in the flat in which she was smiling enough that they could

78
00:04:32,517 --> 00:04:34,278
make that secure identification.

79
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,920
When she died, she was 37 years old.

80
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:44,965
And it's a story that I think everybody, or everybody I've

81
00:04:45,005 --> 00:04:47,067
ever told it to, responds to very strongly.

82
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:52,044
it's unthinkable and horrible that somebody could fall through the cracks to that extent

83
00:04:52,244 --> 00:04:56,147
and this was somebody who had friends, who had a successful career, who had family still

84
00:04:56,187 --> 00:05:00,610
living, who had a father still alive at the time of her death and sisters.

85
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:08,737
It was briefly reported in the UK press, but the story sort of went nowhere because nobody

86
00:05:08,777 --> 00:05:10,058
could find out anything about her.

87
00:05:10,118 --> 00:05:14,481
She dropped so far from kind of...

88
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,233
the way that we normally keep people in our social lives that nobody had any stories to tell.

89
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:28,098
So Carol Morley, an acclaimed documentary filmmaker from the UK, just couldn't let the story go.

90
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:35,682
And so she spent the next five years trying to dig through what she could to try and find out.

91
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:41,357
both more about how Joyce had come to die but also how she lived and who she was and what we'd lost in

92
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:49,421
losing this woman that none of us knew or none of us knew had died. The film was primarily funded

93
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:53,803
by Film4 in the UK who you may know from Slumdog Millionaire and a bunch of other things that you

94
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:59,486
might like and they were really keen early on to make this a

95
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:01,147
uh

96
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,121
a commission that went beyond film.

97
00:06:03,242 --> 00:06:06,984
They knew that there is not necessarily an infinite market

98
00:06:07,004 --> 00:06:08,565
for people who go and see your house documentary,

99
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:09,546
particularly at the cinema.

100
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:12,048
There's often not opportunities for people to see that work

101
00:06:12,068 --> 00:06:14,569
depending on where they live and where the film is screened.

102
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,232
So they wanted to commission something to sit beside it

103
00:06:19,473 --> 00:06:21,454
that would be more accessible to a wider audience

104
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,636
and that would provide an opportunity

105
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:25,817
for people to explore their own reactions to the film.

106
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:31,240
and to Joyce's story. So they knew they wanted it to be digital and interactive,

107
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:37,243
which meant they basically knew they wanted it to be a game. So they came to us and said,

108
00:06:38,043 --> 00:06:42,585
might you be the guys to do this? Now, if you, you may or may not know Hide and Seek,

109
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:46,927
if you do know Hide and Seek, that may seem like a weird thing, because quite a lot of what we do

110
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:48,928
is silly.

111
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:56,051
Quite a lot of what we do has comedy swans in it and involves people running around in streets and reinventing

112
00:06:58,012 --> 00:07:02,354
clues so that it's got zombies in it and Monopoly so that it's about divorce

113
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:06,055
and doing film work but often film work for big entertainment

114
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:12,838
projects like Sherlock Holmes or Green Lantern as I'm sure you have clocked already. But another

115
00:07:12,878 --> 00:07:16,619
half of our work that's maybe not so well known is with more serious and kind of

116
00:07:17,788 --> 00:07:24,592
art house project. So Hinterland was a playable poem that we ran on the streets of Edinburgh

117
00:07:25,032 --> 00:07:31,275
last year. We've made games with Tate Modern, integrating with all of the artwork in their

118
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:35,678
permanent collection, which in Tate Modern is a pretty eclectic and challenging bunch of stuff.

119
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:40,660
And we've done theatre projects and art projects with various kind of national theatres.

120
00:07:41,081 --> 00:07:41,241
So...

121
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,661
Film 4 thought it would be a really great idea to involve us.

122
00:07:45,781 --> 00:07:47,561
We thought it would be a really great idea to involve us,

123
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,001
because this is the kind of stuff we like doing.

124
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:51,842
And I thought it would be an especially good idea,

125
00:07:52,302 --> 00:07:55,122
because I spent a lot of the last 10 years,

126
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,963
some of you have been on the receiving end of it,

127
00:07:57,363 --> 00:07:59,163
talking about the potential of games,

128
00:07:59,203 --> 00:08:02,784
talking about their ability to tackle any subject,

129
00:08:02,924 --> 00:08:04,544
to stand shoulder to shoulder with any other art

130
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:05,684
and entertainment form,

131
00:08:05,924 --> 00:08:08,905
and make things of worth and of weight.

132
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:11,785
So I thought this was a brilliant idea.

133
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,310
It really wasn't.

134
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:18,731
And it really wasn't because the minute

135
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:21,632
you start poking at this proposition,

136
00:08:21,732 --> 00:08:24,714
you start to find all kinds of really difficult constraints

137
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,815
and challenges that affect how you approach the design.

138
00:08:27,835 --> 00:08:29,576
So in kind of no particular order,

139
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:31,357
I thought I'd take you through a few of those

140
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,397
just so you could kind of see how the thing stuck together

141
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:33,738
in our head.

142
00:08:34,218 --> 00:08:36,179
So aesthetics is a place to start.

143
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:41,801
This is a project that has to sit next to a film,

144
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:42,321
a feature film.

145
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:45,415
and not just any feature film, but a documentary.

146
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:48,596
And so very early on, we're asking

147
00:08:48,636 --> 00:08:52,217
those sort of big principle questions of,

148
00:08:52,457 --> 00:08:53,838
what do we think this looks like?

149
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:56,679
Is it going to feel right if it looks like a video game?

150
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:58,439
Is that going to sit well next to the film?

151
00:08:59,119 --> 00:09:02,720
Is it going to feel right if it is illustrated?

152
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:07,522
Because while you have some fantastic animated

153
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:08,262
documentaries,

154
00:09:09,477 --> 00:09:13,280
we had some questions about what happens when you put an animated game against a film documentary

155
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:17,442
and whether or not you kind of trigger any interesting questions about kind of hierarchy

156
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:24,126
of reality and truth in kind of those two things. And so we immediately found that we were kind of

157
00:09:24,206 --> 00:09:27,749
being led in interesting directions about what our aesthetic approach to this thing might be.

158
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:33,130
And part of the reason that's so hard is, as any of you who've ever worked on a film

159
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,851
project know, is that timing is incredibly tricky.

160
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:38,731
That you're probably trying to make a thing that needs to be ready for when the film comes

161
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:42,212
out, that means you've got to start work before the film is finished.

162
00:09:44,273 --> 00:09:51,434
And that's hard enough on a kind of blockbuster film where you can make a bunch of assumptions

163
00:09:51,474 --> 00:09:52,854
about how the thing will come out.

164
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:57,587
you know, you've got hundreds of versions of the script,

165
00:09:57,627 --> 00:09:58,728
assuming you can get hold of them,

166
00:09:58,788 --> 00:10:00,388
to kind of see what's going to happen.

167
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:02,829
And you can maybe even get on set for some of the shoot,

168
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:04,730
or see some of the production design stuff coming through.

169
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,150
And those are experiences we've had before.

170
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:09,071
With Carol's film, this is a documentary

171
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:10,631
based almost entirely on interviews

172
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:13,252
with people from her life,

173
00:10:13,672 --> 00:10:15,593
which meant that right up until the last minute,

174
00:10:15,853 --> 00:10:17,833
new information was kind of emerging

175
00:10:17,873 --> 00:10:18,634
and thinking about,

176
00:10:20,676 --> 00:10:24,398
how the finished version might look. So when we started conversations with her, she had

177
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:28,721
not made any firm decisions about how the film would appear. We knew there would be some moments

178
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:33,303
of recreation of Joyce's life in it, but we didn't know at all what format they would take.

179
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:39,927
And so both you have no access to that information and you also probably have no access really to

180
00:10:39,947 --> 00:10:45,871
the creative team working on the film. This is a low budget passion project for a documentary

181
00:10:45,891 --> 00:10:46,831
maker. They are working.

182
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:52,900
18 hours a day in Dublin on this stuff, and don't necessarily have a whole lot of time

183
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,782
to work with you on the questions you have about how you want your game to look.

184
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:06,425
And that relationship with the film also gave us another interesting problem, which is

185
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:14,048
the incredibly arresting thing about this project is the story of Joyce and all of the

186
00:11:14,568 --> 00:11:16,609
questions that her life and her death trigger.

187
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:20,917
And that's where you want to start.

188
00:11:21,237 --> 00:11:24,540
But that's what the film is doing.

189
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,141
That's what Carol is doing.

190
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:28,423
She's the documentarian.

191
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:32,806
She's the person who spent five years immersing herself in

192
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:34,968
every detail that she can find and building relationships

193
00:11:34,988 --> 00:11:38,331
with all of the people who did No Joyce who were willing to

194
00:11:38,371 --> 00:11:38,831
contribute.

195
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,293
And for us to

196
00:11:42,682 --> 00:11:48,006
present our own version of that story for us to make our own efforts to recreate Joyce's world

197
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:54,951
it seemed both like unnecessary duplication and also really a pretty substantial impertinence

198
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:59,214
right this isn't i make video games i'm not a documentarian i have no business rocking up to

199
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:05,499
this and three weeks later going hey we made a explorable replica of Joyce's flat that we invented

200
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,883
you know from not very much so although

201
00:12:13,403 --> 00:12:17,505
you want to start there because that's clearly the kind of the center of gravity of this whole thing,

202
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:22,407
it becomes a very difficult place to be. And it becomes literally a very difficult place to be.

203
00:12:22,427 --> 00:12:27,470
I mean, I think Film 4 had initially considered some approaches that included things like

204
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:34,593
recreating Joyce's flat as an apartment, as an explorable environment.

205
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,661
instantly

206
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,707
apparent that that's kind of a

207
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,873
macabre and inappropriate thing to do because because Joyce

208
00:12:49,675 --> 00:12:53,119
was there, Joyce's body was there and either you have to include that

209
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,262
in that replica of what you do which is

210
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,553
macabre and difficult, you have to exclude it, which is sort of even worse.

211
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:03,979
And finding a way to put you there that didn't feel intrusive and inappropriate

212
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,785
was something that, you know, I think we very, very early on decided that we

213
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:09,606
didn't want to do. So,

214
00:13:10,387 --> 00:13:12,490
although Joyce was this huge starting point,

215
00:13:15,565 --> 00:13:17,226
we realized quite soon that she actually

216
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:18,786
wasn't going to feature very largely in the work

217
00:13:18,826 --> 00:13:22,127
that we did at all, which leaves you in an interesting place.

218
00:13:22,507 --> 00:13:26,067
All of this, it's worth saying, is happening against what

219
00:13:26,107 --> 00:13:31,929
I think, to be fair, is probably the best-funded art house

220
00:13:31,969 --> 00:13:35,849
transmedia digital game project ever, which is to say,

221
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,610
you know, this is not a AAA title, all right?

222
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,931
You're trying to do this within a very particular set

223
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:43,431
of constraints.

224
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:51,973
But do work that's going to stand up credibly next to something designed to be seen on the big screen.

225
00:13:53,093 --> 00:14:00,756
But also because of the nature of that funding, you have a bunch of other really interesting questions and problems.

226
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:03,897
Joyce's story...

227
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:12,955
touches on some very difficult issues, touches on issues of suicide, touches on issues of

228
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:19,338
domestic violence. At the time when we started working on this, it wasn't clear whether or

229
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:25,140
not we were going to be dealing with issues of drug use. And obviously touches on this

230
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:29,102
central issue of people who go missing, of what that process is.

231
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:34,843
what it can mean about the people who do go missing and what it means for the people who are left behind.

232
00:14:35,663 --> 00:14:40,385
And Film4 is pretty fearless about tackling all of that stuff.

233
00:14:40,405 --> 00:14:44,046
They weren't looking to mark off any particular taboos for us.

234
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,968
But they have a very well-established set of compliance guidelines

235
00:14:49,028 --> 00:14:53,350
and some very well-versed lawyers who have good guidelines and opinions

236
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,651
about how you might tackle these things,

237
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:57,172
about how you make sure that you don't include...

238
00:14:59,219 --> 00:15:07,926
you know, trigger points for self-harm or where you have to think about putting in safety

239
00:15:07,966 --> 00:15:11,169
nets and contact points for people who might be having suicidal thoughts.

240
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:16,533
And you very, I mean, these are very sobering conversations, very, very fast that you don't

241
00:15:16,573 --> 00:15:17,133
necessarily have.

242
00:15:17,514 --> 00:15:23,118
There's also a whole bunch of legal issues here about questions of...

243
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:36,323
libel I guess in terms of suggesting if there was kind of a any direct negligence that led up to

244
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:41,568
Joyce's death and the failure to discover her body. You know because these are all this only

245
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,811
happened a few years ago all the people involved in the story are still alive we're going to play

246
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:45,272
this thing.

247
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:53,374
And so you're very quickly aware that you're navigating in this kind of very complicated space.

248
00:15:53,394 --> 00:15:54,995
And we got a lot of help from Film 4 in doing that.

249
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:58,438
We spent a lot of time talking to people like Missing People,

250
00:15:58,498 --> 00:16:04,023
which is the big missing persons charity in the UK, to try and kind of get our heads around all of these issues.

251
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:12,551
Because the problem with a project like this is it's not just about keeping the lawyers happy.

252
00:16:14,035 --> 00:16:16,397
It's really a lot about not being an asshole.

253
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,140
Because you hear the story, and everybody has their own

254
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,021
immediate reaction to it.

255
00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:22,902
And I think quite a lot of people had a reaction.

256
00:16:23,002 --> 00:16:26,305
I certainly had a reaction, where you go, oh, god, I

257
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:27,025
should ring my brother.

258
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:29,527
I've not spoken to my brother in like three months.

259
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:30,708
That's inexcusable.

260
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:31,369
I should fix that.

261
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:31,849
I should do that.

262
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:32,629
I should call my granny.

263
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,290
I should do this thing.

264
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,952
I should bang on my neighbor's door and introduce myself,

265
00:16:35,972 --> 00:16:37,013
because I still don't know their names,

266
00:16:37,053 --> 00:16:37,613
or whatever it is.

267
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,873
you very quickly start having ideas about how you might

268
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:45,855
structure a game experience that revolves around doing those

269
00:16:45,915 --> 00:16:46,376
kind of things.

270
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:51,059
And possibly, revolves around doing those kind of things in

271
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:51,980
machine-readable ways.

272
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,042
So you start to have over-excited ideas about

273
00:16:54,642 --> 00:16:57,665
scraping people's Facebook accounts for a whole bunch of

274
00:16:57,705 --> 00:17:01,208
information about the size and richness of

275
00:17:01,248 --> 00:17:02,068
their friendship group.

276
00:17:03,249 --> 00:17:05,229
and looking at how often they contact people

277
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,250
and prompting them to get in touch with people

278
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,790
that they haven't contacted for a while

279
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,530
and all this kind of thing.

280
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,431
And then you realize that you have no business doing that.

281
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:16,112
You have no idea who these people are.

282
00:17:16,652 --> 00:17:18,712
The machine-readable portions of their social lives

283
00:17:18,752 --> 00:17:20,053
are only ever portions.

284
00:17:21,133 --> 00:17:24,714
None of you have lives that are fully and wholly represented

285
00:17:25,154 --> 00:17:26,634
in Facebook or on Twitter or whatever it is

286
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:28,414
that you tend to be.

287
00:17:28,975 --> 00:17:29,895
There's people who are there,

288
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:30,755
there's people who are not there,

289
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:31,995
there's maybe people who.

290
00:17:33,836 --> 00:17:37,559
are there who it looks like you never interact with but that's because you see them every day

291
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,681
or you IM them every day or you know whatever else is going on and trying to reconstruct.

292
00:17:43,627 --> 00:17:46,870
a true reflection of somebody's degree of connectedness

293
00:17:47,651 --> 00:17:49,834
from digitally scrapable sources.

294
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:53,718
Again, the minute you poke at it for more than two seconds

295
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:55,180
is clearly not a good idea.

296
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:57,903
Even if you remove the machine readable portion

297
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:01,948
and just say, how long is it since you called your mother?

298
00:18:02,868 --> 00:18:05,589
you may have a really good reason for not having called your mother.

299
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:09,410
I have no business, my game has no business telling you that you ought to do that.

300
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,691
And what you find is you, you...

301
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:15,012
So you step away from that specificity,

302
00:18:16,492 --> 00:18:19,693
and you try and find something that is gentler and more open to interpretation,

303
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:22,373
and then you end up with something that is so wishy-washy and so vague

304
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,134
that nobody cares.

305
00:18:24,154 --> 00:18:29,455
It's like, hey, maybe you should think about a thing that you don't think about if you'd like.

306
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:33,096
It's not like, you know, that's not hooky.

307
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,605
That's not kind of what you want.

308
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:35,806
So that.

309
00:18:37,838 --> 00:18:42,759
you know, that became really important to us. I think particularly when we talk to people like the Missing People charity,

310
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,901
you start to realize lots of things that I hadn't perhaps thought about before as much as I should, that, you know,

311
00:18:48,921 --> 00:18:53,323
sometimes people go missing because they want to go missing. Sometimes people are isolated because they enjoy solitude.

312
00:18:53,343 --> 00:19:00,705
They're happy working that way. Sometimes people like mediating nearly all of their friendships and social life digitally.

313
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:05,367
And that doesn't mean there's anything deficient in that. It doesn't mean there's anything deficient if you don't want to do anything.

314
00:19:05,507 --> 00:19:09,871
digitally and you want to do everything down the pub in real life. It was very difficult

315
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:15,256
to find any firm ground of a thing that we felt we could say that didn't involve being

316
00:19:15,276 --> 00:19:24,965
an asshole. And that led into another realization that really affected the development direction

317
00:19:25,005 --> 00:19:26,366
of the project.

318
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,421
One of the saddest things at the heart of Joyce's story is she was found by accident.

319
00:19:35,601 --> 00:19:36,622
No one knew she was there.

320
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:37,582
No one was looking.

321
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:44,024
Her neighbor had become a bit frustrated the previous year at the noise from the television

322
00:19:44,124 --> 00:19:47,085
and had banged on the wall a bit, but when it hadn't worked, he'd given up.

323
00:19:49,926 --> 00:19:54,727
And that felt incredibly important to me, that this reality, that...

324
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:59,358
this terrible thing had happened and we just didn't know and nobody did anything and nobody

325
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:03,000
was looking and there was no sense of quest, there was no sense of mission, it was a really

326
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,441
interesting thing to take into a game design context because so often that's our structure.

327
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,703
I mean arguably it's always our structure, but there's a thing you're trying to do, there's

328
00:20:10,723 --> 00:20:14,805
a point you're trying to get to, there's a, you know, there's some kind of mission statement

329
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:16,145
or a goal objective.

330
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:19,266
And you know.

331
00:20:21,507 --> 00:20:23,609
Obviously we didn't want to do crass ways to do that.

332
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:26,891
We would, I don't think we would have felt at all comfortable kind of making a game where

333
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:33,014
your job was to save Joyce or, you know, find her earlier or, you know, whatever that could

334
00:20:33,034 --> 00:20:33,354
have been.

335
00:20:33,715 --> 00:20:37,557
But even if you make it oblique, it just started to feel, um...

336
00:20:39,827 --> 00:20:43,270
totally and thematically wrong. Putting you in a structure that was about going,

337
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:47,012
hey, you know, your job is to do this stuff and that will work,

338
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:51,215
just felt to be a structure that was everything that the film and Joyce's

339
00:20:51,235 --> 00:20:55,558
story wasn't about. And it was probably about this point

340
00:20:55,578 --> 00:20:59,601
that we started to get quite scared, because it's like, okay, so now

341
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:01,963
we can't even kind of have that structure.

342
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:06,546
So we're not going to use Joyce's narrative, we're not going to use...

343
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:10,770
that kind of conventional game mission structure.

344
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,572
And then the difficulty is, even when

345
00:21:14,612 --> 00:21:17,754
you start looking on a systemic level, it's really difficult.

346
00:21:17,974 --> 00:21:22,277
So a lot of, and certainly a lot of the work

347
00:21:22,317 --> 00:21:25,839
we've done in gamifying with no air quotes things,

348
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,541
and a lot of what the other people have done,

349
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:31,143
is looking for those essential systems,

350
00:21:31,203 --> 00:21:34,525
is looking at how you boil something down to something

351
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,982
revelatory and interesting about the kind of interplay of key elements within that system.

352
00:21:41,962 --> 00:21:45,703
That's great because games thrive on those structures.

353
00:21:47,384 --> 00:21:54,786
But I think this is interesting because we've talked here often enough about whether or not

354
00:21:54,846 --> 00:22:00,268
it's a realistic goal that we'll ever be able to model the muddier elements of the human

355
00:22:00,288 --> 00:22:02,728
condition in that kind of a way. And

356
00:22:04,892 --> 00:22:10,298
Joyce's story just seemed like, you know, this incredible object lesson in how functionally impossible that is.

357
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:16,926
The systems, there are systems that sit under Joyce's story.

358
00:22:18,047 --> 00:22:20,690
All kinds of systems. There's administrative and institutional systems.

359
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,311
It was clear that...

360
00:22:22,122 --> 00:22:28,088
it became clear from Carol's research that there was some history of domestic violence

361
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:33,232
there and that had put her into a system which had provided her with safe housing but had

362
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:36,895
probably broken her connections with the places that she'd been living prior to that happening.

363
00:22:39,218 --> 00:22:44,062
There is terrible administrative details that come to light.

364
00:22:44,102 --> 00:22:49,166
She had gone into hospital a few months before she died

365
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:53,750
and had listed on her hospital admission sheet as her next of kin, her bank manager,

366
00:22:55,132 --> 00:22:58,434
which is still one of those things that kind of wakes me up at night occasionally.

367
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,522
you know, and then there's all kinds of social and friends relationship, again, it's clear.

368
00:23:04,562 --> 00:23:10,125
I do, if you, if you have a UK iTunes account, you can download Carol's film, it's not released

369
00:23:10,225 --> 00:23:16,408
in the US yet, and it's, it's great, and it is also not as doleful as it sounds, it's

370
00:23:16,448 --> 00:23:17,569
surprisingly life-affirming.

371
00:23:18,249 --> 00:23:22,291
Um, but you, you can definitely map a bunch of, you know, friends there of a, you know,

372
00:23:22,331 --> 00:23:26,113
this friend who was jealous, and this friend who had a secret crush, and this friend who

373
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:26,754
rejected her.

374
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:33,535
There's a whole bunch of professional stuff about where her career took her and financial concerns.

375
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:43,302
There's some kind of systems that underpin her upbringing and the questions of the history of race and racial prejudice in London.

376
00:23:44,543 --> 00:23:45,924
And all of these things are so...

377
00:23:48,683 --> 00:23:55,645
knottedly interconnected and produced these imperceptible, unpredictable, longitudinal,

378
00:23:55,745 --> 00:23:59,986
contradictory changes and effects on each other that even if we could make any kind

379
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:04,127
of statement on how that had played out in Joyce's life, which we obviously can't, the

380
00:24:04,147 --> 00:24:05,147
thing is just a mess.

381
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:08,708
The thing is not navigable as a system and you're left with this choice of...

382
00:24:09,998 --> 00:24:12,600
of you can boil it down, but then you boil it down

383
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,901
to something that's reductive and misleading,

384
00:24:13,961 --> 00:24:14,962
or you can leave it confusing.

385
00:24:14,982 --> 00:24:16,383
And then it's just terrible game design,

386
00:24:16,423 --> 00:24:18,985
because you have no idea why anything is happening,

387
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:21,607
or what's affecting what, or what kind of meaningful choices

388
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,609
you're making, or all the rest of it.

389
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:29,193
And reminder, this whole massive thing

390
00:24:29,873 --> 00:24:32,756
is to be delivered as a super accessible film 4 project that's

391
00:24:32,776 --> 00:24:35,178
going to attract a new audience to this thing.

392
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:38,500
So our goal was to make sure that people

393
00:24:39,992 --> 00:24:44,756
who maybe even hadn't kind of converted to Facebook gaming yet would find something here

394
00:24:44,796 --> 00:24:47,918
that they were comfortable dealing with audiences who weren't necessarily already gamers.

395
00:24:48,898 --> 00:24:53,001
So while I started saying we were trying to make a game about death, we were really trying

396
00:24:53,021 --> 00:24:54,062
to make this game.

397
00:24:59,606 --> 00:24:59,846
Yes.

398
00:25:02,908 --> 00:25:04,509
And we took a swing at that, right?

399
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:06,310
Because we'll give it a go.

400
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,392
That seemed like a thing that we might try to do.

401
00:25:08,512 --> 00:25:08,812
So we...

402
00:25:09,952 --> 00:25:11,373
We turned quite early to text.

403
00:25:11,653 --> 00:25:16,298
Text seemed like a really interesting starting point

404
00:25:16,338 --> 00:25:18,340
for a thing to solve some of those aesthetic problems,

405
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,601
to solve some of the budget problems,

406
00:25:20,802 --> 00:25:22,524
to solve some of the tonal problems.

407
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:29,351
And we thought we could do something interesting

408
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:32,794
and hopefully.

409
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:36,950
meaningful for people by drawing on a bunch of interactive

410
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:42,191
fiction, traditions, looking a bit at text adventure design

411
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:46,433
and graphical text adventure design, and thinking about, oh,

412
00:25:46,453 --> 00:25:47,913
we were so pleased when we came up with this,

413
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:51,754
thinking about if we could create this environment that

414
00:25:51,774 --> 00:25:53,435
may or may not be graphically represented,

415
00:25:53,495 --> 00:25:55,355
that you navigate it in the way that you navigate a text

416
00:25:55,395 --> 00:25:56,356
adventure, broadly speaking.

417
00:25:56,376 --> 00:25:58,776
So you're moving through a sequence of rooms or spaces.

418
00:26:01,277 --> 00:26:02,657
And that would present you with.

419
00:26:05,895 --> 00:26:10,279
Versions of the kinds of puzzles and challenges that you're maybe familiar with from text

420
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,862
adventures. So there are locked doors, there are characters perhaps you won't let you pass,

421
00:26:14,882 --> 00:26:21,988
there are things to navigate. But rather than giving you the kind of tools that often those

422
00:26:22,028 --> 00:26:26,731
games give you of, you know, candles and bits of rope and keys and all the rest of it, we

423
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,292
would ask you to draw those from your own life.

424
00:26:28,953 --> 00:26:35,800
So there would be a room where to move on from that room you would need to leave something behind that was, you know, an object that was precious to you.

425
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:49,014
Or a door, probably wouldn't be a door that would only open if you would tell it the name of someone you never told you loved and you wished you had, or whatever it was, maybe a bit less terribly mawkish than that.

426
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:59,157
And then the process of puzzle solving would be the process of reuniting and restructuring those things and hopefully finding some interesting perspectives on, you know, on how those things work together.

427
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:09,240
So you would move through this space and, you know, in the end, make progress not by unlocking the blue key with the blue door, but in the end, by, you know, giving your.

428
00:27:10,622 --> 00:27:14,863
grandmother's engagement ring to your high school crush or whatever unresolved thing

429
00:27:15,003 --> 00:27:17,464
we had uncovered in the course of doing that.

430
00:27:18,044 --> 00:27:21,966
And we thought that this whole thing might play out, the big reveal at the end would

431
00:27:22,006 --> 00:27:27,728
be that in the choices that you'd made in navigating this space, you were actually navigating

432
00:27:27,788 --> 00:27:32,730
on this map that told you something about yourself in terms of where you situated yourself

433
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,891
on that grid in terms of whether you were somebody who...

434
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:43,477
gravitated to crowds or liked to solitude or was somebody who was kind of more digitally or

435
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:48,903
physically native and then that might be a thing that we could kind of map and take out to the

436
00:27:49,243 --> 00:27:51,786
world as a whole as kind of something that had arisen from this game.

437
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,922
There's a lot about that idea not to like.

438
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:58,504
You're probably sitting there cataloging a lot of those

439
00:27:58,544 --> 00:27:59,085
things right now.

440
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:00,646
I mean, certainly, I don't think there's any kind of

441
00:28:00,706 --> 00:28:02,668
great discovery at the end of that to find out whether you

442
00:28:02,728 --> 00:28:04,929
like being alone or not, or whether or not you're on the

443
00:28:04,969 --> 00:28:05,770
internet often.

444
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:08,412
I suspect you can probably self-diagnose on those counts

445
00:28:08,912 --> 00:28:09,373
quite well.

446
00:28:11,754 --> 00:28:16,598
And also, we started realizing that there were a bunch of

447
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:18,600
problems in

448
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:24,947
uh, giving you that kind of progression structure. That, um,

449
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:31,930
even within, uh, a game that has no overt winning, that has no

450
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,692
kind of great statement of purpose or sense of potential

451
00:28:35,772 --> 00:28:39,334
failure, the minute you sense that your progress is being

452
00:28:39,354 --> 00:28:41,615
gated or that one thing or another thing is going to happen

453
00:28:41,655 --> 00:28:42,535
depending on what you do,

454
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:53,736
When we started paper prototyping this, we found that it totally colored people's responses to questions that we hoped they would feel able to respond to truthfully, honestly.

455
00:28:54,537 --> 00:29:04,403
The thing that I really liked about this structure was there's this kind of confessional space that you form between the player and the game, and the game is an anonymous...

456
00:29:05,984 --> 00:29:09,665
repository of these kind of confessions and information.

457
00:29:10,105 --> 00:29:13,406
But the minute you know there's kind of two ways forward and you're being asked something,

458
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:14,467
you're second guessing the game.

459
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:17,287
You're wondering what you should say, what's going to happen to this, you become incredibly

460
00:29:17,327 --> 00:29:17,868
self-conscious.

461
00:29:18,728 --> 00:29:21,489
And we really struggled to kind of find a way beyond that.

462
00:29:22,349 --> 00:29:24,089
Which took us to Sharj.

463
00:29:25,225 --> 00:29:29,528
Um, this is the, the labyrinth in Chartres Cathedral in France.

464
00:29:30,308 --> 00:29:31,369
We didn't actually get to go there.

465
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:33,590
There's a floor cloth replica in North London.

466
00:29:33,811 --> 00:29:34,331
It's pretty good.

467
00:29:35,171 --> 00:29:37,133
Um, it costs a fiver to get in.

468
00:29:37,353 --> 00:29:38,273
That's the weird thing.

469
00:29:38,714 --> 00:29:40,015
It's like going on a fairground ride.

470
00:29:40,035 --> 00:29:42,276
You have to queue up and give a, give a lady your money at the front.

471
00:29:43,097 --> 00:29:44,638
Um, so you guys will all know this.

472
00:29:44,698 --> 00:29:46,159
I didn't know this because I hadn't been paying attention.

473
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,340
Labyrinths, mazes, very different things.

474
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,501
Mazes are puzzles.

475
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:50,221
They have choices.

476
00:29:50,241 --> 00:29:50,902
You can get lost.

477
00:29:51,382 --> 00:29:54,004
Labyrinths are only ever one continuous line.

478
00:29:54,924 --> 00:29:58,548
There is no choice, there is no possibility to get lost, you just walk along and wiggle.

479
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,673
And that seems like a kind of interesting thing that you have a kind of more traditional

480
00:30:04,713 --> 00:30:09,558
game experience, something with an implicit challenge and a possibility of failure and

481
00:30:09,598 --> 00:30:12,181
a series of choices and you have something that's a classical linear structure.

482
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:18,688
should be boring, therefore, right? We're, we're GDC.

483
00:30:18,728 --> 00:30:20,669
We're a bit snooty about linear. We like interactive.

484
00:30:20,689 --> 00:30:23,870
We like choice. We like challenge. Walking one of

485
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,031
these things blew my mind. I don't know, has

486
00:30:26,071 --> 00:30:27,592
anyone ever done it? Has anyone ever walked Labyrinth?

487
00:30:28,132 --> 00:30:30,594
You guys are great. So I, maybe I just,

488
00:30:30,634 --> 00:30:30,754
like,

489
00:30:32,295 --> 00:30:33,656
I was having a bit of a day.

490
00:30:33,836 --> 00:30:35,618
But this whole weird thing happens,

491
00:30:35,638 --> 00:30:37,379
that all you do is you go in one end

492
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,180
and you walk to the middle.

493
00:30:38,661 --> 00:30:40,462
And the middle is like five yards away.

494
00:30:40,682 --> 00:30:43,525
And you know how far away five yards away is,

495
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:44,165
it's just over there.

496
00:30:44,206 --> 00:30:45,807
You know how long it's gonna take you to walk there,

497
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:47,088
it's gonna take you five seconds.

498
00:30:47,448 --> 00:30:48,890
You know the direction that you're gonna walk to get there

499
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,411
because it's just over there.

500
00:30:50,992 --> 00:30:52,012
Except now suddenly you don't.

501
00:30:52,193 --> 00:30:54,114
Now you have no idea how long it's gonna take you

502
00:30:54,154 --> 00:30:54,855
to walk five yards.

503
00:30:55,815 --> 00:30:58,118
You're walking along this path, you don't know where you are.

504
00:30:58,138 --> 00:31:02,123
Your sense of space and time have effectively dissolved.

505
00:31:02,143 --> 00:31:07,150
You meet somebody coming the other way, but you don't know if they're coming the other

506
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,310
way.

507
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:11,075
They might be going on the same journey as you, but they're just at a different point

508
00:31:11,095 --> 00:31:11,195
today.

509
00:31:11,215 --> 00:31:13,498
And if they're at a different point today, you don't know whether they're ahead of you

510
00:31:13,578 --> 00:31:14,239
or behind you.

511
00:31:15,745 --> 00:31:17,325
And so suddenly that made me feel,

512
00:31:17,465 --> 00:31:18,326
and that's kind of before you get

513
00:31:18,346 --> 00:31:19,926
to all of the kind of experiential choices

514
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:21,907
of just how you act within that space

515
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,488
and what you do with yourself.

516
00:31:23,528 --> 00:31:25,629
So we got kind of excited about linear stuff

517
00:31:25,689 --> 00:31:26,829
and thinking about whether we could use that

518
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:31,771
as a way to diffuse some of these questions

519
00:31:31,871 --> 00:31:33,092
about how to get more...

520
00:31:36,585 --> 00:31:40,926
pure responses from people in terms of the questions that we, the issues that we wanted

521
00:31:40,946 --> 00:31:43,467
to think, them to think about and the questions we wanted to put to them.

522
00:31:44,587 --> 00:31:49,328
But we did just keep hitting up against this problem, that the minute there was any sense

523
00:31:49,568 --> 00:31:56,170
of completion or goal, we felt like we were losing people's ability to be honest.

524
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:00,551
So we played around with that for a bit, we played around a bit with the notion of...

525
00:32:02,124 --> 00:32:05,727
not setting a win condition, but setting a big number of win conditions.

526
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:07,930
So kind of approaching this in a more simmy way.

527
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:13,035
So rather than saying, hey, there's this puzzle or structure or space that you have to get

528
00:32:13,055 --> 00:32:13,536
to the end of.

529
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:17,873
see if you can get that right, go, OK, you can adopt a bunch

530
00:32:17,913 --> 00:32:19,514
of different personas and move through this space

531
00:32:19,534 --> 00:32:20,074
in different ways.

532
00:32:20,094 --> 00:32:22,295
So try and make the right set of decisions

533
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,215
for somebody who's a loner.

534
00:32:23,355 --> 00:32:25,176
It also gets us out of the being an asshole problem

535
00:32:25,196 --> 00:32:27,117
where we're not telling people there's a right way to do it.

536
00:32:27,857 --> 00:32:30,539
So successfully navigate this space as a loner.

537
00:32:30,579 --> 00:32:35,281
Successfully do it as a parent.

538
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:37,082
Successfully do it as whatever those kind of personas

539
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,422
would end up have being.

540
00:32:39,854 --> 00:32:43,457
That kind of worked a bit as a bit of game design, but it made us really sad because

541
00:32:43,497 --> 00:32:45,799
it loses the player being the player.

542
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,801
What I really liked about the intensity of that relationship between the player and the

543
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,342
game was you were you.

544
00:32:50,442 --> 00:32:51,843
I like making games where you are you.

545
00:32:53,745 --> 00:32:58,449
And that seemed to kind of dilute that to a point where it wasn't interesting anymore.

546
00:32:59,449 --> 00:33:03,172
Another option you have is make it so that the player defines the win conditions.

547
00:33:03,212 --> 00:33:04,373
Go, hey, we're not going to be judgmental.

548
00:33:04,393 --> 00:33:06,755
We're not going to tell you how to live your life.

549
00:33:07,393 --> 00:33:11,014
we're gonna let you say what it is that you care about or you're aiming for.

550
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:16,937
Again, the problem is the minute you, um, overtly ask somebody that question,

551
00:33:17,517 --> 00:33:19,758
even if it's in an automatic way,

552
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:24,580
they don't tell you what they think, they tell you what they think they're supposed to think,

553
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:30,102
and it's incredibly difficult to find a structure that lets people actually answer honestly in those circumstances.

554
00:33:30,663 --> 00:33:33,124
And then we thought that maybe reflecting the, the...

555
00:33:34,568 --> 00:33:37,810
insights that we've had about a kind of mission and quest structure

556
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:41,974
being inappropriate for Joyce's story, we would secretly not have a winning

557
00:33:41,994 --> 00:33:44,335
condition. So we would set you up in a structure

558
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:48,939
where you thought you knew what you were doing,

559
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:51,521
you had a bunch of stuff to keep you busy that you were kind of chewing

560
00:33:51,561 --> 00:33:54,783
through, and at the end of it we would go, oh no, but look while you were busy

561
00:33:55,344 --> 00:33:58,606
doing all of that stuff, you really lost because there was this other thing going

562
00:33:58,726 --> 00:34:00,407
on that we didn't tell you about, that you

563
00:34:00,427 --> 00:34:02,289
didn't know about, that is sad.

564
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:07,503
And then I'm an asshole again, right?

565
00:34:07,603 --> 00:34:09,185
That's terrible game design.

566
00:34:10,706 --> 00:34:12,828
So there was this kind of,

567
00:34:12,848 --> 00:34:16,131
I don't have sound for this,

568
00:34:16,151 --> 00:34:19,374
but there should be like the sound of massive stone slabs

569
00:34:19,394 --> 00:34:22,437
dropping onto bleak, rocky ground.

570
00:34:22,457 --> 00:34:25,220
I'm just thinking, you know.

571
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:30,632
we really tried, but we couldn't find a game that, that, that fit within those things that we talked about.

572
00:34:30,732 --> 00:34:36,294
And, and that really kind of shook me, because I've had long campaigned on the principle that

573
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:39,315
games, you know, really can do anything.

574
00:34:40,836 --> 00:34:43,597
So, we did something clever.

575
00:34:44,778 --> 00:34:45,978
We made a thing that wasn't a game.

576
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:51,493
And that thing is dreamsofyourlife.com if you want to go and have a look at it after

577
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:51,693
this.

578
00:34:52,253 --> 00:34:52,674
And it worked!

579
00:34:52,714 --> 00:34:53,274
Hooray!

580
00:34:53,555 --> 00:34:54,035
Great news.

581
00:34:54,275 --> 00:34:54,636
Everything.

582
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:56,558
Okay, we made a pretty good thing that isn't a game.

583
00:34:56,658 --> 00:34:59,781
So we worked with an amazing novelist called A.L.

584
00:34:59,801 --> 00:35:05,808
Kennedy, who if you don't know, you should check out, who turned out to be a secret expert

585
00:35:05,908 --> 00:35:06,669
on all kinds of...

586
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:13,535
really interesting sort of Stanley Milgram experiments and Barnum statements and psychic

587
00:35:13,595 --> 00:35:17,658
codes and stuff that turned out to be an incredibly useful way to try and structure the text of

588
00:35:17,678 --> 00:35:18,078
what we wanted.

589
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:23,903
We worked with this amazing photographer, Lottie Davis, whose work you are seeing, who

590
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:29,687
helped us think about how we might find a way to photographically represent some of

591
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,188
the issues that we wanted to...

592
00:35:32,855 --> 00:35:39,797
tackle. And we made something that's been pretty well received, that we're super proud of, and that

593
00:35:40,057 --> 00:35:48,679
we think stands effectively next to the film. So I should be thrilled, right? I should be, this

594
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:53,040
session should have a different title. But I'm not, because it wasn't a game, and I really wanted

595
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:59,341
to make a game because I like making games, and I wanted to find a resolution to that.

596
00:36:00,481 --> 00:36:00,941
And the thing is...

597
00:36:02,238 --> 00:36:05,819
It's possible that all that happened was just those constraints that I took you through

598
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:06,760
were just too crazy.

599
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,501
They were just too nested, too many of them.

600
00:36:09,141 --> 00:36:10,802
We just boxed ourselves into a corner.

601
00:36:11,542 --> 00:36:14,043
The fact that we couldn't find a solution to it doesn't say anything about games.

602
00:36:14,103 --> 00:36:18,605
It just says that we overcooked our design process.

603
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:21,806
But the thing that makes me less sure about that is...

604
00:36:22,934 --> 00:36:24,396
This isn't the first time this has happened.

605
00:36:26,077 --> 00:36:29,040
This is a process that is now becoming fairly familiar to me.

606
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,464
So we did an awesome, genuinely secret laboratory project

607
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:35,687
that I can't tell you about because I'm still NDA'd last

608
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:40,792
year that was working with a scientific institution that

609
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:45,456
was looking to improve its energy usage.

610
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:47,700
and go greener.

611
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,062
And one of the things that was preventing it from doing that

612
00:36:50,122 --> 00:36:54,305
is they have these huge block of climate control rooms

613
00:36:54,366 --> 00:36:55,627
in which they run experiments.

614
00:36:56,287 --> 00:36:58,349
And they felt that they were probably using that really

615
00:36:58,369 --> 00:36:58,929
inefficiently.

616
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:00,090
And was there a game that we could

617
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:03,093
make that would motivate and reward scientists

618
00:37:03,113 --> 00:37:07,456
for doing a better job of combining experiments

619
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,138
and finding ways that they could share those rooms

620
00:37:09,178 --> 00:37:09,718
and use them better?

621
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,320
We couldn't find one.

622
00:37:13,781 --> 00:37:14,742
Because the minute you.

623
00:37:16,049 --> 00:37:22,955
set a bunch of game objectives and game rewards on top of that system, you distract them or

624
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:27,499
divert them from the already completely important set of goals and constraints that they have

625
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:28,219
in the work that they do.

626
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:34,104
Can we make a really awesome tool that makes planning this stuff more fun, that is really

627
00:37:34,144 --> 00:37:37,547
impactful in terms of improving their energy use, that draws on a whole bunch of stuff

628
00:37:37,607 --> 00:37:38,608
I've learned as a game designer?

629
00:37:39,108 --> 00:37:39,669
Absolutely.

630
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:40,890
But it wasn't a game.

631
00:37:42,283 --> 00:37:46,205
look, it says so on everything. Science, okay, what about, if

632
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:48,466
it's not secret laboratories, what about, what about this? So

633
00:37:48,486 --> 00:37:51,208
this is a thing we did last year as part of the Green Lantern,

634
00:37:51,628 --> 00:37:56,370
um, campaign. Uh, which I really like, it was a nice thing. Um,

635
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,752
Green Lantern, you know, all about his green ring, space

636
00:37:59,792 --> 00:38:06,815
battles, bad acting. Um, and we wanted to do something maybe a

637
00:38:06,855 --> 00:38:09,636
bit more interesting with it than, than just do a bad org,

638
00:38:09,976 --> 00:38:10,236
although.

639
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:15,038
we did a little cute org as well. Uh, so we hooked up with

640
00:38:15,058 --> 00:38:16,739
these guys, this is the Milky Way Projector, you may know,

641
00:38:16,779 --> 00:38:20,822
they're scientists who operate out of Oxford. They get real

642
00:38:20,862 --> 00:38:26,787
people to look at, mm, uh, these are pictures from the NASA

643
00:38:27,387 --> 00:38:30,390
Spitzer Space Telescope that haven't yet been classified.

644
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:33,172
Because there's billions of them and there's not enough grad

645
00:38:33,212 --> 00:38:36,354
students. Um, and just get real people to look through them and

646
00:38:36,374 --> 00:38:36,995
see what they can see.

647
00:38:38,465 --> 00:38:45,512
And what we're looking at, at the moment, in the bit that we hooked up with, is the

648
00:38:45,552 --> 00:38:46,533
birth of stars.

649
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:48,074
When stars are born, they explode.

650
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:55,942
There's a pressure wave that sends out a globe of gas and debris around the exploding star.

651
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,011
You take a photograph of that, you see it from the side.

652
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,211
What you see is a ring.

653
00:39:00,851 --> 00:39:03,232
And in the photos, they colored them in green.

654
00:39:03,852 --> 00:39:06,013
So suddenly, I have all of these photos of green rings

655
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:09,234
in space that NASA need people to look at just before the

656
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:10,514
Green Lantern really launches.

657
00:39:10,574 --> 00:39:12,015
So I think that would be a nice thing to do.

658
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:14,175
So we hooked that into the stuff that we were doing.

659
00:39:14,235 --> 00:39:15,996
But those guys who are really smart.

660
00:39:16,776 --> 00:39:21,158
already know you can't put game objectives on top of this observation process, that the

661
00:39:21,198 --> 00:39:25,059
minute you set people goals, the minute you say how many, how fast can you classify ten

662
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,361
things, how many green rings can you find, any of the kind of obvious structures that

663
00:39:28,401 --> 00:39:33,523
you might go to to make a game of it, corrupts the results, changes the, loses the veracity

664
00:39:33,543 --> 00:39:34,943
of what people do.

665
00:39:35,243 --> 00:39:37,884
So they have a lovely slick system, there's a nice...

666
00:39:38,963 --> 00:39:43,124
air quotes gamification process going on here in terms of giving you level rewards and giving

667
00:39:43,144 --> 00:39:47,085
you a sense of progression, a sense of your place in the community, but it's absolutely

668
00:39:47,145 --> 00:39:47,585
not a game.

669
00:39:49,646 --> 00:39:52,646
And then the same thing happened with another secret music project I can't tell you about,

670
00:39:52,726 --> 00:39:56,367
which was about looking at what we could do with gaming around listening habits.

671
00:39:56,507 --> 00:40:01,128
And you, I mean it's interesting, this hits the same thing but at another element of the

672
00:40:01,168 --> 00:40:02,108
same thing, which is...

673
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:09,992
There are games you make where the game places a value on the music that you listen to.

674
00:40:10,152 --> 00:40:13,596
So either we do something that judges the music that you listen to and says,

675
00:40:13,636 --> 00:40:16,919
well, this band is worth more than that band because they have a higher chart position,

676
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:19,142
or they've sold more records, or they have more likes on Facebook,

677
00:40:19,242 --> 00:40:22,526
or however, or because we think they're better, or however we draw that data from.

678
00:40:23,747 --> 00:40:26,008
Or we can do a thing that says the more you listen to this,

679
00:40:26,228 --> 00:40:27,049
you know, so I don't know if any of you

680
00:40:27,069 --> 00:40:30,772
played Song Summoner on your iPod back in 2007,

681
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:35,155
which is a lovely little Scroenix RPG where

682
00:40:35,195 --> 00:40:38,317
your characters are built from songs on your iPod.

683
00:40:38,337 --> 00:40:39,618
And the more you listen to that song,

684
00:40:39,658 --> 00:40:41,519
the more kind of that character levels up.

685
00:40:41,559 --> 00:40:42,760
That's a simplification.

686
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,281
But the key point is the more you

687
00:40:44,301 --> 00:40:46,643
listen to that piece of music, the more powerful

688
00:40:46,663 --> 00:40:47,223
you are in the game.

689
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:51,523
Music is this incredibly important thing in people's life.

690
00:40:51,563 --> 00:40:55,604
The game doesn't know if you just got dumped or you just got a new job or you're going

691
00:40:55,644 --> 00:40:56,224
on holiday.

692
00:40:56,244 --> 00:41:01,245
I mean, I found playing those games where my listening habits are impactful in the game

693
00:41:01,265 --> 00:41:03,085
that I'm playing just makes me hate music.

694
00:41:03,506 --> 00:41:06,726
You just get up in the morning and go, oh, God, I've got to put that thing on repeat

695
00:41:06,786 --> 00:41:11,207
for 10 listens, otherwise I won't get my, you know, spangle when I log in.

696
00:41:11,987 --> 00:41:14,788
And I don't ‑‑ I think there are things you could do.

697
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:18,469
I don't really want to do them because I think I'm ruining people's relationship with music

698
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:18,689
and ‑‑

699
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:21,632
That's not a nice way to spend your life.

700
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:25,015
So what does this prove?

701
00:41:25,996 --> 00:41:26,937
It might prove this.

702
00:41:27,898 --> 00:41:31,561
And I'm aware that I've kind of taken a risk of standing up in a room full of game designers

703
00:41:31,961 --> 00:41:35,745
and going, this is an impossible game design challenge, nobody can solve this.

704
00:41:35,885 --> 00:41:39,909
And you guys already probably have notebooks full of ways to solve it.

705
00:41:40,349 --> 00:41:41,731
So I might just be rubbish at it.

706
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:46,195
you know, I'll take that. If anybody has better ideas for what we could have done, I would love to

707
00:41:46,235 --> 00:41:50,238
hear them, you know, I, I would love to see this problem solved, so, you know, by all means,

708
00:41:50,478 --> 00:41:56,182
pepper me with those. Um, you know, but it is worth saying that I, I worked with a bunch of

709
00:41:56,202 --> 00:41:59,865
smart people on this and we tried really hard and we, we came up blank and, and maybe that

710
00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:05,530
tells us something important, which is, maybe this is just really hard. Um, maybe, you know,

711
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,251
it's okay that we, that, that...

712
00:42:08,557 --> 00:42:13,040
in the time that we've been spent trying to bolt games into the real world in interesting

713
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,521
and important ways that we haven't completely cracked it yet.

714
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:20,463
But there's this other thing which is the scary thing which is maybe this just doesn't

715
00:42:20,523 --> 00:42:20,864
work.

716
00:42:21,744 --> 00:42:26,266
You know, the reason I love making games is I see them transform people in this incredible

717
00:42:26,286 --> 00:42:26,486
way.

718
00:42:26,747 --> 00:42:31,069
The great delight for me moving from working on digital games to also working on games

719
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:35,431
in the real world is you see face to face people do things they never would have thought

720
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:37,132
they could do.

721
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:44,543
you know, become kind of characters that you wouldn't otherwise have thought they were.

722
00:42:46,004 --> 00:42:53,190
But it feels so much to me that the reason games manage to accomplish that has an awful

723
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,853
lot to do with the fact that the constraints that games set up are temporary and arbitrary.

724
00:42:57,494 --> 00:42:58,835
That's what makes them so powerful.

725
00:42:59,475 --> 00:43:05,000
And the minute you bolt those structures onto something that is real and enduring and ongoing,

726
00:43:06,029 --> 00:43:18,692
there just is a tension. It is hard to do the things I can do in games that don't have to sustain that structure that moves against it.

727
00:43:18,752 --> 00:43:26,153
So this is kind of where I hit that we may have a problem here.

728
00:43:28,473 --> 00:43:30,754
Or certainly a problem that I didn't immediately know how to solve.

729
00:43:33,617 --> 00:43:37,420
low point. I refer you back to my takeaway slides of going,

730
00:43:39,381 --> 00:43:43,784
bollocks, what do I do now? And I have, um, I couldn't fit all

731
00:43:43,804 --> 00:43:47,567
of this into an hour, so I have some terribly highfalutin kind

732
00:43:47,607 --> 00:43:52,410
of, um, attempts at structures that I don't think do work that

733
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:56,273
anyone has ever done before, but may be useful in terms of when

734
00:43:56,293 --> 00:43:58,074
you're approaching one of these projects, figuring out what it

735
00:43:58,154 --> 00:43:59,275
is that you, um,

736
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:03,901
what kind of structures you might want to use.

737
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:07,803
But in the end, it isn't actually what I wanted to talk about today.

738
00:44:07,823 --> 00:44:09,964
I don't think that's what's interesting about today.

739
00:44:09,984 --> 00:44:14,106
What I wanted to do was come and be honest about a real project

740
00:44:15,147 --> 00:44:17,148
that presented these kind of real challenges.

741
00:44:17,228 --> 00:44:22,631
Because in the end, I don't feel nearly as bad about this as I expected to.

742
00:44:23,692 --> 00:44:24,272
It is all okay.

743
00:44:24,312 --> 00:44:28,875
I think mostly I've realized what's happened is that...

744
00:44:30,392 --> 00:44:31,993
And this maybe says more about me than anything else.

745
00:44:32,434 --> 00:44:34,716
I guess this was kind of previously my conception of games.

746
00:44:35,197 --> 00:44:37,920
Games could go anywhere, games could do anything, games are unstoppable.

747
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:40,402
And that was what excited me about them.

748
00:44:40,623 --> 00:44:44,066
I felt like there was this huge new potential that we were only just beginning to explore.

749
00:44:44,647 --> 00:44:46,949
Now, I think games are more like that.

750
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:51,574
I don't know how many of you played Shadow of the Colossus, but aggros.

751
00:44:52,883 --> 00:44:57,725
a much subtler and more sensitive creature than the horses in Skyrim.

752
00:44:57,965 --> 00:44:58,946
He can't go everywhere.

753
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:00,647
He has his own idiosyncrasies.

754
00:45:01,107 --> 00:45:01,927
He's wonderful.

755
00:45:02,928 --> 00:45:06,849
I care far more about him in the end than I do about any of the Skyrim horses that I

756
00:45:06,889 --> 00:45:07,510
rode over cliffs.

757
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:08,930
Sorry, Skyrim horses.

758
00:45:11,364 --> 00:45:13,986
And I think that's great.

759
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:16,728
I think if we start to butt up against hard edges of things

760
00:45:16,768 --> 00:45:18,509
that games can't do, that shouldn't

761
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:19,550
depress us about games.

762
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:23,933
That shouldn't make us feel that games have failed to make

763
00:45:23,973 --> 00:45:25,894
a case for why they ought to be allowed to stand shoulder to

764
00:45:25,914 --> 00:45:27,655
shoulder with anything and everything else.

765
00:45:27,735 --> 00:45:30,557
But they should delight us that we're starting to get a

766
00:45:30,577 --> 00:45:33,259
sense of what it is that makes them special, that we're

767
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,780
zeroing in on what it is that.

768
00:45:36,983 --> 00:45:38,304
games can do that other things can't do.

769
00:45:38,864 --> 00:45:39,845
And then you take another swing.

770
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:41,506
So this is, we're taking another swing.

771
00:45:41,546 --> 00:45:42,766
This is South by Southwest.

772
00:45:43,066 --> 00:45:46,468
This is the live game version of our game about the lady

773
00:45:46,488 --> 00:45:49,309
who died in a flat, which we think might work,

774
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,290
which is another different approach.

775
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:52,051
Again, probably not a game, but I've

776
00:45:52,331 --> 00:45:53,992
loved having a chance to take another swing at it,

777
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:55,292
to take what I learned from the last one

778
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:57,633
and come back and do this.

779
00:45:57,794 --> 00:45:59,915
And you know what?

780
00:46:00,275 --> 00:46:03,196
Um, also this.

781
00:46:05,297 --> 00:46:32,984
here we are at GDC again and I think a lot of us have this experience that you slog away for a year at this project that whatever it is probably has you close to tears at times and you forget there's all these awesome people who can help and who are already doing this and who already know this stuff and I think it's been really nice being here having written this talk in the dark days of the end of last year to come here now and see everyone and start having conversations and start hearing about the other projects that we heard about

782
00:46:34,966 --> 00:46:36,687
at the summits yesterday and that we'll hear about

783
00:46:36,707 --> 00:46:38,869
in the rest of the week, that start to find

784
00:46:38,909 --> 00:46:40,851
other solutions to these problems and start to show

785
00:46:41,572 --> 00:46:44,814
ways in which we can refine our understanding of the theory

786
00:46:45,054 --> 00:46:47,476
and prove out those assumptions in practice

787
00:46:48,617 --> 00:46:50,719
in a way that kind of resolve all of that.

788
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,901
So, ha, got ya.

789
00:46:53,401 --> 00:46:55,063
Not the bleakest session ever, I hope.

790
00:46:56,464 --> 00:46:58,285
I wanted to leave, we've kind of got 10 minutes

791
00:46:58,305 --> 00:46:59,567
for questions, because I kind of thought people

792
00:46:59,587 --> 00:47:01,268
would want to shout at me and tell me that we'd missed

793
00:47:01,308 --> 00:47:03,450
a really obvious thing we could have done that was great.

794
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:06,652
So we've kind of got 10 minutes.

795
00:47:06,812 --> 00:47:09,733
I can talk more about anything you would like me to

796
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:13,615
or kind of more about structures that we use in this work.

797
00:47:13,655 --> 00:47:14,856
So far away if you've got anything.

798
00:47:14,876 --> 00:47:15,056
Thank you.

799
00:47:15,076 --> 00:47:25,521
Thank you.

800
00:47:25,681 --> 00:47:25,982
Thank you.

801
00:47:26,002 --> 00:47:26,202
Thank you.

802
00:47:26,222 --> 00:47:26,422
Thank you.

803
00:47:26,442 --> 00:47:26,702
Thank you.

804
00:47:26,722 --> 00:47:26,922
Thank you.

805
00:47:26,962 --> 00:47:27,382
Thank you.

806
00:47:27,422 --> 00:47:27,602
Thank you.

807
00:47:27,622 --> 00:47:27,823
Thank you.

808
00:47:27,843 --> 00:47:28,023
Thank you.

809
00:47:28,043 --> 00:47:28,243
Thank you.

810
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:31,337
Hi, thank you for a great talk.

811
00:47:32,618 --> 00:47:38,123
I, last fall, made a game that was kind of a documentary game

812
00:47:38,183 --> 00:47:41,126
about some soldiers accused of war crimes.

813
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:43,087
And I faced a lot of sort of similar challenges

814
00:47:43,107 --> 00:47:43,528
to what you faced.

815
00:47:43,548 --> 00:47:43,728
I'm sure.

816
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,050
And ended up with something that I sort of didn't

817
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,291
feel comfortable calling a game.

818
00:47:50,502 --> 00:47:53,964
Something that I'm sure also you faced that was a big

819
00:47:53,984 --> 00:47:56,346
challenge was even convincing someone to try a thing like

820
00:47:56,386 --> 00:47:59,088
that because when I would say that sentence a lot of people

821
00:47:59,108 --> 00:48:02,111
would just immediately sort of like eyes glaze over back up

822
00:48:02,151 --> 00:48:03,712
no that doesn't sound like something I want to do.

823
00:48:04,953 --> 00:48:15,022
whether it's a game or not, when you have that sort of interactive thing exploring this like very serious issue that sounds like it's going to be a huge downer, what do you think are ways to get people to like take a chance on playing something like that?

824
00:48:15,122 --> 00:48:23,590
So I'm honor bound to repeat the question so that it goes on the tape. The question of how you get people to approach games that are about this kind of super serious subject that aren't necessarily very appealing.

825
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:31,016
We tried to work in two things on that front for this. So the actual front door to this project is a Facebook quiz.

826
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:34,792
which is funny and social and lightweight,

827
00:48:35,453 --> 00:48:38,236
but just starts to dig into kind of some of those

828
00:48:38,636 --> 00:48:39,917
slightly darker questions.

829
00:48:39,977 --> 00:48:41,959
Again, I can link anybody out to that who wants it.

830
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:45,663
And that has a little kind of link through at the end

831
00:48:45,683 --> 00:48:47,765
that goes, oh, okay, so you seem really interesting.

832
00:48:47,785 --> 00:48:50,007
You should come and have this conversation over here.

833
00:48:52,048 --> 00:48:57,935
And I think the people who played that had a pretty positive experience with it, but

834
00:48:57,955 --> 00:49:00,978
you just hit the problem then of how you market that thing and how you get that notice from

835
00:49:00,998 --> 00:49:01,298
Facebook.

836
00:49:01,879 --> 00:49:05,823
And the other thing is these photos that you've seen and that you'll see if you play the experience,

837
00:49:07,085 --> 00:49:11,109
there's a time-lapse animation that spits out every day from the game.

838
00:49:12,687 --> 00:49:13,768
I've given up not calling it a game.

839
00:49:13,788 --> 00:49:15,649
What am I going to do?

840
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:19,892
So everybody who plays, everything they do every day,

841
00:49:20,113 --> 00:49:22,554
the choices that they make and the routes that they take

842
00:49:22,574 --> 00:49:29,859
through this thing are logged and then are used to recreate

843
00:49:29,879 --> 00:49:32,421
a kind of unique edit of that thing.

844
00:49:32,481 --> 00:49:34,463
It doesn't show anything personal that they said or

845
00:49:34,503 --> 00:49:35,443
anything individual about them.

846
00:49:35,744 --> 00:49:38,746
But we hoped would become a little kind of shareable thing

847
00:49:38,766 --> 00:49:40,287
because it takes a minute and it's pretty to watch.

848
00:49:41,364 --> 00:49:44,787
Again, that probably didn't have quite the impact that we were hoping to do, but I think

849
00:49:44,807 --> 00:49:45,287
you're exactly right.

850
00:49:45,307 --> 00:49:49,490
You've got to think about how you bring people to this kind of work, whether or not it ends

851
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:50,011
up being a game.

852
00:49:51,912 --> 00:49:57,437
Before you'd resigned yourself to this not being a game at all, were there any other

853
00:49:57,477 --> 00:50:01,680
games that you looked at for inspiration or that you thought had sort of blazed that trail

854
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,361
before?

855
00:50:02,781 --> 00:50:04,502
And if so, what were they?

856
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:07,745
I mean, I think we were looking at all kinds of stuff.

857
00:50:07,765 --> 00:50:09,666
I mean, we've ended up doing quite a lot of...

858
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:12,682
projects about death over the last year and a half.

859
00:50:13,003 --> 00:50:15,004
So we contributed to the...

860
00:50:15,024 --> 00:50:17,205
There's a big art center in London

861
00:50:17,225 --> 00:50:18,645
that ran a festival of death this year,

862
00:50:18,705 --> 00:50:21,467
and we did talks there on death in games.

863
00:50:23,828 --> 00:50:25,529
And there's, I mean, pages,

864
00:50:25,629 --> 00:50:27,710
pages and pages and pages of stuff.

865
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:30,391
And then also a whole range of things

866
00:50:30,431 --> 00:50:32,692
that aren't necessarily about death,

867
00:50:32,712 --> 00:50:36,034
but are about subtleties in this stuff.

868
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:40,882
So I don't think we're at all trailblazing.

869
00:50:40,922 --> 00:50:46,188
I don't want to come off as thinking

870
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:48,130
that we're the first people who ever faced this stuff.

871
00:50:50,273 --> 00:50:57,302
But I think often the projects that I knew and that I looked

872
00:50:57,422 --> 00:50:58,002
at weren't.

873
00:50:59,363 --> 00:51:01,784
if they were about death tended not to be, they're often very

874
00:51:01,844 --> 00:51:04,965
personal but they weren't documentary and so that, that

875
00:51:05,766 --> 00:51:07,987
kind of limited their usefulness because they often got to do

876
00:51:08,007 --> 00:51:10,447
things that we couldn't get to do and I now can't give you a

877
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:13,689
really good list but um I can afterwards if you ask me, sorry.

878
00:51:14,549 --> 00:51:16,189
Oh and I forgot to repeat the question which is did we look at

879
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:17,950
any other games, that was probably obvious from my answer.

880
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:22,512
We'll do left and then right. Uh yeah so I hesitate to use the

881
00:51:22,652 --> 00:51:24,913
word appeal but it seems like a part of the appeal of this

882
00:51:24,973 --> 00:51:28,574
project is that this was a real person and so you've, you've

883
00:51:28,594 --> 00:51:28,794
kind of

884
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:33,950
morbid almost kind of fascination with it. Do you think you would have taken a different kind of

885
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:39,433
creative direction or found game mechanics that would have made more made it more gamey had it

886
00:51:39,473 --> 00:51:44,156
been a fictional person that you created? Would you maybe not been so I guess reverent about it

887
00:51:44,216 --> 00:51:49,520
and do you think it would have affected you know the outcome for better or worse? So question here

888
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:54,003
would it would it have been an easier project if the person had been fictional? Oh my word yes.

889
00:51:55,099 --> 00:52:00,064
You know, I think, I mean, I think reverence is a fair word there.

890
00:52:00,144 --> 00:52:07,011
I think there is maybe a fair comment that we were overly sensitive about these issues.

891
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:12,596
You know, this is the first project and unlike this, I think one of the things that you face as a documentarian is...

892
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:20,790
developing your own practice about how reverent you're going to be about how much you wear

893
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:24,812
kid gloves when you handle this stuff and we may be over worried about that. I think

894
00:52:25,112 --> 00:52:28,474
because we also had this nested thing which it wasn't just what could we do with Joyce's

895
00:52:28,494 --> 00:52:31,816
story but it was we also had to be respectful of what Carol was doing with her film and

896
00:52:31,836 --> 00:52:34,137
we ended up at kind of two removes from that content.

897
00:52:35,077 --> 00:52:38,740
Had it been our own fictional person, we would have had a lot more freedom, but we also would

898
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:42,862
have had a lot less impact, right? The thing that gets you in the gut about Joyce is it's true,

899
00:52:42,882 --> 00:52:49,326
it happened. You can't walk past that block of flats in North London now without knowing

900
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:55,570
that unfolded there. So, easier, but maybe less powerful. Thank you.

901
00:52:56,905 --> 00:53:03,448
So first of all, thank you for an amazing talk and for your capacity to sort of reveal the creative process

902
00:53:03,528 --> 00:53:10,712
It's very informative. So awesome. Thank you in listening to what you were talking about. I am unclear where

903
00:53:11,372 --> 00:53:14,694
Exactly you guys hit the wall. Can you talk about?

904
00:53:15,475 --> 00:53:18,076
your expectations around agency and

905
00:53:18,476 --> 00:53:23,679
or appeal because it felt to me as you were discussing that that maybe where you hit was having a

906
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:28,423
a particular expectation around that that may have conflicted with, like we were talking

907
00:53:28,463 --> 00:53:29,465
about, the need for reverence.

908
00:53:33,449 --> 00:53:35,991
where did we hit the wall and was it around the question of agency?

909
00:53:36,011 --> 00:53:37,191
It's a fair proceed.

910
00:53:37,651 --> 00:53:41,173
I mean yes, a lot. I think oddly, probably one of the things that hurt us on this project

911
00:53:41,274 --> 00:53:42,654
was our background in designing

912
00:53:43,155 --> 00:53:44,255
real world games.

913
00:53:44,936 --> 00:53:48,377
That I've seen those be so transformative and I've absolutely seen those

914
00:53:48,918 --> 00:53:52,980
be, I've experienced those being revelatory, where you find yourself

915
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,622
doing something or say something that you never would have thought you would

916
00:53:55,662 --> 00:53:56,902
but is actually a truer

917
00:53:57,262 --> 00:53:59,003
expression of who you are than if you'd had...

918
00:53:59,664 --> 00:54:03,625
time the way you normally do in life to compose your reply and present the front

919
00:54:03,645 --> 00:54:07,466
that you want to present and I was definitely chasing that I was really

920
00:54:07,606 --> 00:54:11,947
hoping that I could do that but I couldn't find the bait-and-switch that

921
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,368
you need to do though which is I need to get you thinking that you're doing

922
00:54:14,408 --> 00:54:19,529
something else and focus your agency and focus maybe the constraints or the time

923
00:54:19,549 --> 00:54:21,490
pressure or the competition or whatever it is that's gonna

924
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:30,235
force you to reveal those things within this context and truthful structure.

925
00:54:30,815 --> 00:54:32,996
And God, I wish we could have, because I think that could have been incredible.

926
00:54:33,196 --> 00:54:42,801
But I think what we have accomplishes the emotional goal that I set for the project,

927
00:54:43,242 --> 00:54:46,423
but through different means, through non-game means, and I would love to have got there through games.

928
00:54:49,972 --> 00:54:53,314
I want to start by saying I think you might be selling yourself short a little bit.

929
00:54:54,234 --> 00:54:55,535
It sounds like a really hard problem.

930
00:54:58,476 --> 00:55:00,697
Thank you.

931
00:55:01,238 --> 00:55:08,261
I wanted to ask, you mentioned a couple of times with the astronomy and with the music game.

932
00:55:09,388 --> 00:55:12,031
that sort of adding a game mechanic

933
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:15,114
kind of screws up the experience.

934
00:55:16,196 --> 00:55:18,719
And I wonder if that might be because

935
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,642
there's already a game mechanic there

936
00:55:22,123 --> 00:55:25,527
and that game mechanic is sort of a part of life

937
00:55:26,087 --> 00:55:27,809
and we just, we don't know what that is.

938
00:55:28,722 --> 00:55:34,486
So the question is, is it hard to do these projects because there's already mechanics in place that then conflict with the game mechanics?

939
00:55:35,026 --> 00:55:39,009
Yeah! I mean, I don't think they're necessarily game mechanics, they're just mechanics.

940
00:55:39,029 --> 00:55:42,871
There are a whole bunch of systems that drive the choices that you make in relation to these things.

941
00:55:42,991 --> 00:55:50,336
And I think I have like hand signals now for how I try and think about these things that, you know,

942
00:55:50,756 --> 00:55:57,020
we're always chasing the game of, like, make this thing, make this thing into a game.

943
00:55:58,197 --> 00:56:02,619
and that that transformative approach is not necessarily right and that sometimes

944
00:56:05,821 --> 00:56:13,025
there's it's interesting looking at at kind of two feet this is oversimplified but kind of two

945
00:56:13,045 --> 00:56:18,207
fields you've kind of got the um the subject to the narrative of the and the context of the thing

946
00:56:18,247 --> 00:56:20,148
that you're working with and then you've kind of got it's

947
00:56:20,987 --> 00:56:22,489
rules and objectives and interactions.

948
00:56:23,269 --> 00:56:26,952
And often where these projects don't work well is when you try and stack everything

949
00:56:26,992 --> 00:56:27,413
on top of those.

950
00:56:27,433 --> 00:56:31,456
You're going to go and stay in that context and we'll work with those interactions and

951
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:36,100
objectives, and we'll try and put a game on top of that, and we'll just, and it doesn't

952
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:36,680
work very well.

953
00:56:37,101 --> 00:56:38,422
And there are often much more.

954
00:56:39,715 --> 00:56:44,100
successful approaches where you turn one of those through 90 degrees. You go, okay, so

955
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,284
we'll look at those objectives and actions and mechanics, but we'll actually just change

956
00:56:47,304 --> 00:56:50,627
the context. We'll, you know, this is maybe a game about saving energy, but we'll tell

957
00:56:50,647 --> 00:56:55,793
you that it's about parrots, or we'll tell you that it's about space aliens, or whatever.

958
00:56:56,759 --> 00:56:59,401
And that's something you see quite often, and there's kind of a good reason for that.

959
00:56:59,722 --> 00:57:01,483
That helps release that tension.

960
00:57:01,884 --> 00:57:03,025
Or you do it the other way and go,

961
00:57:03,085 --> 00:57:06,407
yeah, we will keep you in the context and the narrative of this topic,

962
00:57:06,487 --> 00:57:08,609
but we'll change the things that you're worrying about.

963
00:57:08,629 --> 00:57:10,351
We'll maybe invent completely new fictional ones

964
00:57:10,391 --> 00:57:13,493
that aren't actually about any kind of real-world behavior change.

965
00:57:14,094 --> 00:57:15,715
Or you kind of separate both.

966
00:57:16,056 --> 00:57:19,178
And, I mean, this is a thing, you know, where I ended up with is,

967
00:57:20,359 --> 00:57:23,102
with games, I can make a game that uses your listening habits

968
00:57:23,122 --> 00:57:24,223
that I have a bunch of problems with.

969
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:29,243
or I can make a game that really uses your listening habits as window dressing,

970
00:57:30,344 --> 00:57:35,105
you know, where they color what's going on, but they're not meaningful game tokens,

971
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:36,425
they're not really changing the system.

972
00:57:37,045 --> 00:57:40,426
And that's not making a game of your music taste,

973
00:57:40,446 --> 00:57:42,607
but it maybe is making a game with your music taste.

974
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,627
With is a word I've come to use a lot.

975
00:57:44,948 --> 00:57:45,528
And that kind of...

976
00:57:47,067 --> 00:57:53,172
side-by-side, looser relationship often feels like a way of dealing with that, that very real tension,

977
00:57:53,192 --> 00:57:57,576
which is obvious the minute you say it, and again, there are so many people in here who do this

978
00:57:57,656 --> 00:58:00,438
awesomely for a living, and I'm super aware that they know this stuff inside out, but

979
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:05,142
you know, I thought it might be interesting to kind of work through a specific example and see.

980
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:07,945
Thank you. Thank you for

981
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:10,071
Thank you for a beautiful talk.

982
00:58:10,771 --> 00:58:13,552
It sounds like along the way, emotions arose,

983
00:58:14,692 --> 00:58:16,132
as we would expect.

984
00:58:16,492 --> 00:58:20,413
And I'm wondering to what degree at each stage along the way

985
00:58:20,593 --> 00:58:23,394
you thought about what emotions you wanted to convey

986
00:58:23,554 --> 00:58:26,535
and what techniques or devices you thought about using

987
00:58:26,695 --> 00:58:27,955
to convey those emotions.

988
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:35,013
So the question of what emotions were we trying to instill in our players, I mean, again,

989
00:58:35,073 --> 00:58:37,394
you worry about being a jerk and telling you what to feel.

990
00:58:37,974 --> 00:58:41,596
But then you also hit this thing that, again, often in the game projects that I make, you

991
00:58:41,636 --> 00:58:45,078
don't hit of kind of having to have an artist statement, kind of having to go, what am I

992
00:58:45,118 --> 00:58:45,938
trying to do with this?

993
00:58:45,978 --> 00:58:47,619
And I found that scary.

994
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,340
And I don't know how well I did.

995
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:55,063
But in the end, what it boiled down to for me was, and I think this project is a quite

996
00:58:55,083 --> 00:58:56,944
nice expression for this, is that the thing that I felt...

997
00:58:57,797 --> 00:59:01,239
I could truthfully say to everyone about Joyce's story is,

998
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,581
time passes faster than you realize

999
00:59:03,621 --> 00:59:05,242
and things happen when you're not looking.

1000
00:59:05,682 --> 00:59:06,823
Which doesn't sound like much,

1001
00:59:06,983 --> 00:59:09,524
but it felt like an important and universal thing.

1002
00:59:09,864 --> 00:59:12,386
And so this whole project is about those two things.

1003
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:13,867
It's about time passing faster than you realize

1004
00:59:13,907 --> 00:59:15,027
and things changing when you don't look.

1005
00:59:15,848 --> 00:59:19,790
and then I leave it up to you to decide how to feel about those phenomenons.

1006
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:24,633
But without that, one of the reasons we, even once we decided not to make a game,

1007
00:59:25,054 --> 00:59:28,155
we were still lost in the weeds for a while until we doubled down on that,

1008
00:59:28,556 --> 00:59:32,698
on it needed a core, it needed something that we were willing to make an absolute statement about,

1009
00:59:32,758 --> 00:59:35,640
otherwise it was just airy-fairy float.

1010
00:59:36,861 --> 00:59:40,743
I felt like this photograph conveyed a lot of emotion that was suitable to the project,

1011
00:59:40,763 --> 00:59:41,243
for instance.

1012
00:59:41,888 --> 00:59:44,429
I mean, the work that went into this, I cannot begin to tell.

1013
00:59:44,629 --> 00:59:50,190
This was a three-day shoot that did a two-year time lapse.

1014
00:59:50,591 --> 00:59:53,151
So we had 11 stunt daffodils.

1015
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:56,212
We poisoned and then baked those flowers

1016
00:59:56,272 --> 00:59:57,312
to make it look like they were dying.

1017
00:59:57,712 --> 00:59:59,473
That tree behind you is a tree that we

1018
01:00:01,213 --> 01:00:02,553
bust up from 200 miles away.

1019
01:00:02,593 --> 01:00:03,934
All of those leaves are hand-wired

1020
01:00:03,954 --> 01:00:06,134
because we shot this in February when there was nothing there.

1021
01:00:06,774 --> 01:00:09,115
We scouted, I think, 25 locations

1022
01:00:09,155 --> 01:00:10,475
to find a window that was kind of.

1023
01:00:12,219 --> 01:00:18,686
anonymous but believable and not too sad but could kind of decay and I hope you know I

1024
01:00:18,806 --> 01:00:21,488
mean that was just wonderful to hear that because I know a huge amount of that came

1025
01:00:21,508 --> 01:00:25,092
from Lottie and Allison and the team on that to try and convey that.

1026
01:00:25,673 --> 01:00:25,973
Thank you.

1027
01:00:28,736 --> 01:00:32,980
Okay so bear with me because my original question was technically asked so I had to modify it

1028
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:33,380
in line.

1029
01:00:33,641 --> 01:00:33,941
For sure.

1030
01:00:34,441 --> 01:00:35,082
Okay so.

1031
01:00:36,337 --> 01:00:40,660
Drawing from the experience that you guys had with trying to work with Dream of a Life,

1032
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:45,864
say you were to take from that experience and go towards a fictitious route, where you

1033
01:00:45,884 --> 01:00:51,829
did say it was easier to consider that, how would you exactly convey the impact of death?

1034
01:00:51,889 --> 01:00:56,673
I mean, the impact of death is kind of centered around what was done in life and what wasn't

1035
01:00:56,713 --> 01:01:01,737
done in life and what you were able to experience being taken away from you and never coming

1036
01:01:01,797 --> 01:01:02,017
back.

1037
01:01:02,752 --> 01:01:06,294
Or would you guys kind of go through the carnal instinct of survival?

1038
01:01:06,534 --> 01:01:09,936
Just death-sucking in general, like nobody wants to die.

1039
01:01:09,956 --> 01:01:10,877
I mean, I think...

1040
01:01:11,797 --> 01:01:16,280
So, how would we approach the project if we didn't have the documentary core to it?

1041
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,301
I mean, we've been playing around with that a bit.

1042
01:01:21,255 --> 01:01:24,939
It's really interesting trying to push it out into the lives of the players as much as possible.

1043
01:01:24,959 --> 01:01:30,064
I'm not really interested in writing a big complex narrative about fictional characters, fictional death.

1044
01:01:30,184 --> 01:01:34,568
I'm interested in poking everybody out there and seeing what happens.

1045
01:01:34,969 --> 01:01:37,832
And I think, you know, we, for the Festival of Death, we were looking at kind of...

1046
01:01:40,569 --> 01:01:45,790
live action Conway game of life variations where your behavior

1047
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:48,371
in that simulation was dependent on choices that you made that

1048
01:01:48,391 --> 01:01:49,851
were maybe reflective of your own life.

1049
01:01:51,931 --> 01:01:55,652
And I think we looked now, I'm remembering the answer to the

1050
01:01:55,692 --> 01:01:57,232
previous gentleman's question, you know, we were looking, I

1051
01:01:57,252 --> 01:01:59,513
just spent a whole year playing games about death, kind of, but

1052
01:01:59,533 --> 01:02:02,893
particularly kind of perma or relatively perma death games.

1053
01:02:02,953 --> 01:02:06,094
So kind of road like things where death is a really big

1054
01:02:06,134 --> 01:02:08,595
loss and something to fear and not just an instant respawn.

1055
01:02:10,288 --> 01:02:14,300
And I think there are all kinds of structures there, but I think...

1056
01:02:17,091 --> 01:02:19,773
I mean the other kind of really depressing note I could have ended on is that maybe games

1057
01:02:19,813 --> 01:02:22,195
are the worst place to try and tackle the question of death.

1058
01:02:22,956 --> 01:02:29,542
Because we have this weird relationship with death not ever being a real thing in games.

1059
01:02:29,642 --> 01:02:32,424
There's an indie game, I don't know if you've heard of it, I can't remember the name of

1060
01:02:32,484 --> 01:02:34,866
it for the life of me so anybody here totally help me out.

1061
01:02:34,986 --> 01:02:35,567
Someone will know.

1062
01:02:36,748 --> 01:02:41,452
It's an indie game where you download it to your PC and literally you just have one chance

1063
01:02:41,552 --> 01:02:41,732
at it.

1064
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:43,474
One life to live, thank you.

1065
01:02:44,691 --> 01:02:45,711
Yeah, no, I mean, amazing.

1066
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:48,252
I mean, yeah, if I could have come up with that,

1067
01:02:48,272 --> 01:02:49,173
then I wouldn't have been standing up here

1068
01:02:49,193 --> 01:02:50,413
looking like an idiot for the last hour.

1069
01:02:50,453 --> 01:02:52,414
So, I mean, I think that's fantastic work.

1070
01:02:52,734 --> 01:02:57,796
But I think it's interesting how abstracted that is.

1071
01:02:57,816 --> 01:02:59,556
I mean, it's what gives it its power,

1072
01:03:01,017 --> 01:03:02,037
but also how unplayable.

1073
01:03:02,097 --> 01:03:03,658
I mean, it's interesting.

1074
01:03:03,818 --> 01:03:04,758
I've never been brave enough.

1075
01:03:04,778 --> 01:03:05,459
Have you been brave enough?

1076
01:03:05,539 --> 01:03:09,420
I've never actually let it taken that risk.

1077
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,972
I mean, so this is it.

1078
01:03:10,992 --> 01:03:11,853
So this is kind of where I am.

1079
01:03:11,893 --> 01:03:14,558
I think there's a ton of interesting stuff to do here and I think everybody here is in

1080
01:03:14,578 --> 01:03:15,199
the middle of doing it.

1081
01:03:15,219 --> 01:03:18,245
And I just like giving kind of progress updates.

1082
01:03:19,347 --> 01:03:19,567
Thank you.

1083
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:20,228
Thank you for the amazing talk.

1084
01:03:20,248 --> 01:03:22,372
And we're out of time, so I have to stop, but grab me if you have anything more.

1085
01:03:22,392 --> 01:03:23,334
And thank you very much for coming.
