1
00:00:05,837 --> 00:00:07,997
Thank you all very much for coming to my talk on,

2
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:09,898
as you can see, environment design

3
00:00:09,958 --> 00:00:11,298
as spatial cinematography.

4
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:14,579
I have been asked to ask you to turn your cell phones off

5
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:16,159
and to fill in the forms at the end.

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:17,659
And yeah.

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,000
So before I begin the talk properly,

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,481
some quick introductions.

9
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:25,241
So my name is Miriam Ballard.

10
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:27,302
I am the art director for visual development

11
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:28,362
at Rockstar North.

12
00:00:29,437 --> 00:00:32,118
I have a background in architecture and film

13
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:33,458
as well as video games.

14
00:00:34,158 --> 00:00:35,758
So my architecture background,

15
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:38,459
I hold a first class honors degree in architecture

16
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:40,299
from Auckland University in New Zealand.

17
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:43,040
So I'm a Kiwi, if you can't tell by my accent.

18
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,521
With film, the highlight of my film career

19
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:48,721
would have been as a set designer on King Kong.

20
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:51,522
So that was a Peter Jackson film filmed in New Zealand.

21
00:00:52,382 --> 00:00:55,202
And with video games, the highlight of my video game career

22
00:00:55,302 --> 00:00:57,443
is most definitely my current job at Rockstar.

23
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:02,425
However, I haven't just worked on big budget and AAA.

24
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:05,168
When I started in the film industry,

25
00:01:05,268 --> 00:01:07,350
that was on low-budget things,

26
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,093
so short films, music videos, low-budget TV,

27
00:01:11,294 --> 00:01:13,115
and low-budget features.

28
00:01:13,936 --> 00:01:17,059
With video games, I also started out at an indie studio,

29
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:18,360
and I returned to indie work

30
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,782
in the middle of my career as well.

31
00:01:20,723 --> 00:01:24,930
So this talk is not just aimed at the big budget in AAA.

32
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,357
It should be useful to anybody who's using 3D environments

33
00:01:29,838 --> 00:01:32,803
for their video games, no matter what your budget level.

34
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:38,236
So my team, so I lead a team of visual development artists.

35
00:01:38,737 --> 00:01:40,498
They come from a similar background,

36
00:01:40,598 --> 00:01:43,640
so I have on my team architects, interior designers,

37
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,061
people from film as well,

38
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:48,123
and also people from the 3D environment art.

39
00:01:48,783 --> 00:01:50,704
And the kind of work that we do on my team

40
00:01:50,904 --> 00:01:52,966
is this kind of stuff that you see here.

41
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:57,829
So we do a mixture of these 3D models that you see,

42
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,171
which internally we call previs models.

43
00:02:00,652 --> 00:02:03,434
So they're sketch models that are, I suppose,

44
00:02:03,474 --> 00:02:05,775
the first exploration of an environment.

45
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:09,999
We also do reference boards, color palette passes,

46
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,980
and some 2D artwork as well.

47
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:15,863
We don't tend to work much in 2D plans.

48
00:02:15,923 --> 00:02:17,985
We might do an initial schematic of a space,

49
00:02:18,385 --> 00:02:20,066
but generally most stuff is worked out in 3D.

50
00:02:21,963 --> 00:02:24,664
So I think it will help for this talk

51
00:02:24,704 --> 00:02:26,925
if I also explain a little bit about how things are

52
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:30,346
structured at Rockstar in terms of environment design.

53
00:02:30,747 --> 00:02:32,667
Because obviously, it's different at every studio.

54
00:02:33,448 --> 00:02:37,069
So for us, the responsibility of the first pass

55
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:41,091
of an environment layout is actually the art department,

56
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:42,331
not game design.

57
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:45,693
So we do it like that just because that's what suits us,

58
00:02:45,753 --> 00:02:47,874
and that's what suits our games.

59
00:02:49,575 --> 00:02:50,815
Everybody has different needs.

60
00:02:51,655 --> 00:02:53,717
how my own team fits into that.

61
00:02:54,377 --> 00:02:58,120
So anything that is particularly difficult or problematic

62
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,841
goes to the visual development artists.

63
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:04,504
So on exteriors, that means things

64
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:08,566
like there are specific issues, which are a bit more tricky,

65
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:10,908
and maybe specific areas as well.

66
00:03:11,308 --> 00:03:13,089
Those will go to the visual development artists

67
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:14,030
on exteriors.

68
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,112
For interiors, every single interior

69
00:03:17,152 --> 00:03:18,613
gets a visual development pass.

70
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:21,892
So, introductions over.

71
00:03:23,313 --> 00:03:23,953
The main talk,

72
00:03:24,414 --> 00:03:26,855
Environment Design as Spatial Cinematography.

73
00:03:27,396 --> 00:03:28,236
What do I mean by this?

74
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:33,870
So, in most video games, the player is controlling the camera, not the developer.

75
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:40,452
However, we can still make cinematic experiences. We just need to do this through controlling the

76
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:45,193
environment rather than trying to control the camera. So, to repeat that, because that's the

77
00:03:45,213 --> 00:03:50,535
main point of this talk, even though the player is controlling the camera, we can still create

78
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:55,717
cinematic experiences. We just need to make those experiences by controlling the environment.

79
00:03:57,668 --> 00:04:00,931
That is quite a big question, how do we do this?

80
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:02,653
And like any big question,

81
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:04,695
it's best broken into smaller questions.

82
00:04:05,396 --> 00:04:07,658
So how do we control the 2D screen?

83
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,099
How do we control movement?

84
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:10,700
And how do we control time?

85
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:14,144
Now, in film, this would obviously be done

86
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:16,666
either with camera or with editing, all of these things.

87
00:04:17,026 --> 00:04:18,207
But again, we need to figure out

88
00:04:18,247 --> 00:04:19,649
how to do it with the environment.

89
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,631
So starting with the 2D screen.

90
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:27,983
So we need to compose the 3D for how it's going to look in 2D.

91
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:30,684
This is the one thing that differentiates us

92
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,145
from other media.

93
00:04:32,425 --> 00:04:35,566
So for painting, they're obviously painting directly

94
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:36,947
on the final 2D product.

95
00:04:37,507 --> 00:04:39,868
For film and for cinematography,

96
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:42,449
I'm sorry, for photography and cinematography,

97
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:44,410
they are obviously using the camera

98
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,670
to control what's on screen.

99
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:48,291
For us, we are composing the 3D

100
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:49,572
for how it's going to look in 2D.

101
00:04:51,115 --> 00:04:52,556
This is one of the things that we use

102
00:04:52,637 --> 00:04:53,718
our previs models for.

103
00:04:54,118 --> 00:04:55,500
So I'm not sure if I mentioned before

104
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,783
the sketch models that we use

105
00:04:57,903 --> 00:04:59,204
as part of our initial pass.

106
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:01,387
Internally, we call them previs models.

107
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:03,449
I haven't heard anyone else use that term,

108
00:05:03,489 --> 00:05:05,772
but if I say previs, that's what I'm talking about.

109
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:11,362
So we use our previous models to work out

110
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:13,403
what we're getting on screen.

111
00:05:13,663 --> 00:05:17,406
We also use them to solve lots of other problems as well.

112
00:05:17,847 --> 00:05:21,189
I forgot to mention before that one of the goals

113
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:23,491
of my department of the visual development artists

114
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,612
is to make sure things work for everybody.

115
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:29,655
So we are not just solving aesthetic only problems.

116
00:05:29,956 --> 00:05:32,938
We are making sure that our designs are going to work

117
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,521
for game design, for environment art.

118
00:05:37,381 --> 00:05:39,744
for the art direction, for narration, for everybody.

119
00:05:40,204 --> 00:05:42,806
This is not aesthetics over functionality.

120
00:05:42,866 --> 00:05:45,028
This is aesthetics and functionality.

121
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:48,552
So as I was saying, one of the things

122
00:05:48,592 --> 00:05:49,893
that we use the Previz for,

123
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:53,576
alongside, you know, having given game design

124
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:54,637
something to test with,

125
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:57,080
and environment artists something to feedback on,

126
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,822
we also use it to compose what's on screen.

127
00:06:00,763 --> 00:06:07,565
So this here is the previz that we did for the lab area

128
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:09,126
and the Doomsday Heist DLC.

129
00:06:09,546 --> 00:06:11,487
So everything I'm going to be showing you in this talk

130
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:14,628
is all from GTA V Online DLC, just so you know.

131
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:18,309
So that view was tweaked for the player,

132
00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:19,910
it was designed around the player view.

133
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,571
That, by the way, is from this angle here.

134
00:06:23,891 --> 00:06:26,372
So we are designing around choke points and through routes

135
00:06:26,732 --> 00:06:28,513
because we know where the player is going to be

136
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:29,593
in those situations.

137
00:06:30,578 --> 00:06:30,723
now.

138
00:06:31,612 --> 00:06:34,492
We, like, this does mean that we can't get

139
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:37,353
every single angle absolutely perfect,

140
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:39,533
but this isn't that different to film either.

141
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:41,973
In film, you might start a shot

142
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,694
with something that's beautifully composed.

143
00:06:43,994 --> 00:06:45,274
You might end a shot with something

144
00:06:45,294 --> 00:06:46,514
that's beautifully composed,

145
00:06:46,814 --> 00:06:50,255
but not every single frame in between that

146
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:51,855
is going to be a perfect composition.

147
00:06:52,335 --> 00:06:53,215
It's the same for us.

148
00:06:53,615 --> 00:06:55,816
We know where the player is going to be at certain moments

149
00:06:55,876 --> 00:06:57,796
and where they're going to be looking at certain moments.

150
00:06:58,276 --> 00:07:00,717
It doesn't matter, or it can't be helped.

151
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:02,937
if some angles aren't perfect.

152
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:05,199
And that again was that view there.

153
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:08,400
This, by the way, is how the Previs

154
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,941
relates to the final product.

155
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:14,603
So as you can see, when the lighting team came in,

156
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:18,205
the final composition isn't exactly the same

157
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:19,625
as it started in the Previs,

158
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:24,127
but they have had a good structure to work with.

159
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:26,849
They're not trying to fix something that's not working.

160
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:29,510
They've got something that they can enhance and add to.

161
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:36,153
All of the screenshots I'm going to show you, by the way, and player videos are all of just

162
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:42,915
real players playing the game. They're not set up by marketing or as a developer run-through.

163
00:07:42,935 --> 00:07:48,698
It's just normal players playing normally. Okay, and this is the same environment,

164
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:50,538
but just from a different angle.

165
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,353
So this is one of the things that we're doing

166
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:59,458
with our previz, so I'll explain those third markers later.

167
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,384
But what we are doing is we are tweaking the 3D

168
00:08:04,424 --> 00:08:07,087
for how it looks in 2D, so we are moving around the space

169
00:08:07,147 --> 00:08:08,068
and we are designing

170
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:15,192
by moving through it. So we'll start in Max, which is the modeling program we use, and we'll tweak so

171
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:20,194
that we have good compositions on screen in Max. We'll also take it into the test bed, which is

172
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:26,977
what you're seeing here. So you'll notice how a lot of the lines of the building are all lining

173
00:08:27,037 --> 00:08:31,499
up with those third markers. And again, not every composition is perfect, like this angle isn't

174
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:37,802
quite as good as the other ones, but again, when we swing around, it's nice again. Yeah.

175
00:08:38,757 --> 00:08:41,480
And again, you'll notice that the proportions of the building,

176
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:45,544
even the heights between the distance from floor to ceiling,

177
00:08:45,965 --> 00:08:48,427
are all in proportion to those third markers.

178
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:54,346
So this is how it came out in the final product.

179
00:08:55,207 --> 00:08:57,068
So the composition has actually been

180
00:08:57,108 --> 00:09:00,090
enhanced by the extra planters we added for game design.

181
00:09:01,131 --> 00:09:04,333
And as you can see, the composition from the previs

182
00:09:04,373 --> 00:09:05,434
has basically stood up.

183
00:09:05,934 --> 00:09:08,196
The one bit that doesn't work is where we're going right now.

184
00:09:08,436 --> 00:09:10,857
And that was a little bit of an oversight on my part.

185
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:11,318
I didn't.

186
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:17,502
yeah, realize how much they were going to use these stairs. So these stairs aren't composed nicely for

187
00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:22,065
for the 2D, but you can see that it gets nice again when we get up to the top.

188
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:28,191
Okay, so that bit there was the only bit

189
00:09:28,431 --> 00:09:32,494
that makes us different to other media in this respect,

190
00:09:32,654 --> 00:09:35,516
that we are composing the 3D for how it looks in 2D.

191
00:09:36,017 --> 00:09:38,939
Beyond that, when it comes to controlling the 2D screen,

192
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:42,281
it is the same advice that you get for any other media.

193
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:46,036
So it's the kind of advice that you would get for painting,

194
00:09:46,096 --> 00:09:48,280
for photography, cinematography, and so on.

195
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:52,287
So one of that, so one piece of advice you get

196
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:55,372
in those other media is to have nice 2D compositions.

197
00:09:56,598 --> 00:10:00,920
So one aspect of that is these third markers

198
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,060
that were on the videos.

199
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:06,141
So what that is, is there's a rule of thumb,

200
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:08,542
and it is definitely a rule of thumb, not an absolute rule.

201
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:11,223
There is a rule of thumb about dividing your screen

202
00:10:11,263 --> 00:10:13,764
up into thirds and having the main compositional weight

203
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:16,725
of the image sitting on those third markers.

204
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:20,163
So you'll notice how in the first image

205
00:10:20,603 --> 00:10:22,384
that the weight of the composition

206
00:10:22,544 --> 00:10:25,945
is right at the edge of the screen and not in the center.

207
00:10:26,806 --> 00:10:28,307
However, in the final image,

208
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:31,828
I've pulled the walls in closer and the desk in closer

209
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:34,149
and the weight of the architecture,

210
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:36,190
the composition of the 2D image

211
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,931
is sitting closer to the CERT markers

212
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:39,832
and it's a much nicer composition,

213
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:43,354
but not that much was actually changed in the model.

214
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:47,017
So this is something that we're doing again as we're moving through the space.

215
00:10:47,097 --> 00:10:49,639
We are tweaking to get nice on-screen compositions.

216
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,564
And again, we're not only concerned with the on-screen compositions,

217
00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:57,267
we're also adjusting the space for other needs as well.

218
00:10:57,287 --> 00:10:59,629
It's just this is the topic of this talk.

219
00:11:01,671 --> 00:11:05,074
So that again was the view as you enter the space.

220
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:08,517
So again, we're concerning ourselves with choke points and through routes.

221
00:11:10,465 --> 00:11:13,167
So another useful compositional technique

222
00:11:13,387 --> 00:11:17,831
is a concept of tangents, specifically avoiding tangents.

223
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:20,654
So you will notice in the first image

224
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,256
that the line of the desk is lining up

225
00:11:23,296 --> 00:11:24,417
with the wall behind it.

226
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:29,802
So it's doing it in 2D from this very specific angle.

227
00:11:30,663 --> 00:11:35,425
This makes the space incredibly hard to read. It is very hard to tell in that first image

228
00:11:36,186 --> 00:11:42,028
how the desk relates to the wall behind it spatially. However, in the second image I've

229
00:11:42,048 --> 00:11:46,551
just tweaked the desk a little bit shorter and suddenly we can read the space much better.

230
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:49,152
We can see that the desk is sitting in front of the wall.

231
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:53,336
So, this is what is called tangents.

232
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:54,737
So, that tangents are when

233
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:57,580
unrelated objects are lining up on a 2D image.

234
00:11:58,121 --> 00:11:59,483
Again, this is something that needs to be

235
00:11:59,543 --> 00:12:02,165
avoided because it's hard to read the 3D space.

236
00:12:02,686 --> 00:12:04,007
They are very easy to fix.

237
00:12:04,728 --> 00:12:05,929
The tricky thing with them is

238
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,711
actually finding them in the first place.

239
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:15,130
Another thing we want to consider is the angle of the cameras that are going to be used in this space.

240
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:19,751
So this here is the same space but in different setups.

241
00:12:20,311 --> 00:12:26,092
So the first setup the player is just exploring the space and the second setup they are in combat mode.

242
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:30,013
As you can see the camera is very different in the two scenarios.

243
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:37,195
So what we want to do as much as possible is to compose the environment so that it looks good

244
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:39,915
in any camera setup that's going to be used in the space.

245
00:12:40,916 --> 00:12:45,618
Now, it's not always possible to do this for every camera setup, obviously, but again,

246
00:12:45,658 --> 00:12:47,278
this is an ideal to aim for.

247
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:54,101
So if you want to know more about compositions on 2D screen, this here is a particularly

248
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:54,642
good book.

249
00:12:55,202 --> 00:12:59,104
I will also, by the way, be showing a list of all the books I reference right at the

250
00:12:59,224 --> 00:13:02,365
end, so don't feel like you need to write them down as I go.

251
00:13:03,703 --> 00:13:05,504
Also, if you don't want to buy books,

252
00:13:05,645 --> 00:13:08,547
there's actually a lot of advice on compositions online,

253
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,069
so you don't need to get it, it's just a good one.

254
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,873
One thing that book doesn't mention, however, is tangents.

255
00:13:16,593 --> 00:13:19,315
But if you search online for avoiding tangents in art,

256
00:13:19,395 --> 00:13:20,997
you'll find a lot of advice on it.

257
00:13:21,937 --> 00:13:25,100
And for anyone who wants to delve into the science

258
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,862
of why tangents are a problem,

259
00:13:28,482 --> 00:13:31,185
there's a lot of good information in that book there.

260
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:38,778
So as well as creating good compositions on screen, we also want to create depth on screen.

261
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:43,301
So a screen by its nature is 2D, it's flat,

262
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:48,064
which means that we need to use tips and tricks to trick the eye into seeing depth.

263
00:13:49,343 --> 00:13:52,184
One of the easiest techniques for doing this

264
00:13:52,384 --> 00:13:53,945
is creating layers.

265
00:13:54,505 --> 00:13:56,847
So by layers, I mean having foreground,

266
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:58,427
mid-ground, and background elements.

267
00:13:59,408 --> 00:14:02,109
And what happens in the scene is what you see here.

268
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:04,690
The foreground elements move at a different speed

269
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:07,172
across the screen to the mid-ground and background

270
00:14:07,272 --> 00:14:07,692
elements.

271
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:10,335
So this creates parallax animation,

272
00:14:10,455 --> 00:14:13,498
which is obviously what old school Disney animation uses.

273
00:14:14,179 --> 00:14:16,141
It's also an incredibly good way to make

274
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:19,806
for very good bang for buck dynamic environments.

275
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,393
So another way to create good depth on screen

276
00:14:31,314 --> 00:14:32,716
is with repeating elements.

277
00:14:33,196 --> 00:14:35,780
So if you have identical elements throughout the scene

278
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,962
that are different depths in the scene,

279
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:42,248
the player can use the relative sizes of those elements

280
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:44,230
to judge the depth of the space.

281
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,942
Another good way of creating depth is the use of atmospherics.

282
00:14:52,662 --> 00:14:56,365
So this is not part of our Pre-Vis and Pre-Production pass,

283
00:14:56,945 --> 00:15:00,507
but because it has such a big effect, it felt remiss not to mention it.

284
00:15:01,348 --> 00:15:04,289
So for anyone who doesn't know what atmospherics are, they are when

285
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:08,652
particles in the atmosphere scatter the light and they make distant objects

286
00:15:08,932 --> 00:15:12,214
less distinct, and you get the kind of effect

287
00:15:12,254 --> 00:15:13,015
that you're seeing here.

288
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:16,577
So for more on depth on screen,

289
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:18,579
this here is a particularly good book.

290
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,944
So as well as creating good compositions

291
00:15:23,024 --> 00:15:24,446
and creating depth on screen,

292
00:15:24,807 --> 00:15:27,710
we also want to control the shapes that we get on screen.

293
00:15:29,071 --> 00:15:29,512
So in,

294
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:35,603
We can use the shapes on screen to create an emotional experience for the player.

295
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:41,950
So in terms of evolution, different shapes have different emotional effects on us.

296
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:48,677
So our ancestors who liked certain shapes that in nature were associated with safe things,

297
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:52,261
those ancestors were more likely to survive and have us.

298
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:58,424
Our ancestors who disliked shapes in nature that were associated with dangerous things,

299
00:15:58,864 --> 00:16:02,185
those ancestors were more likely to survive and have us.

300
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:08,508
So we have inherited the likes and dislikes of our ancestors that helped them to survive.

301
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:15,371
Now we can use those shapes and the emotional effect of those shapes to create an emotional

302
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:16,491
experience for the player.

303
00:16:18,014 --> 00:16:23,179
So circular shapes in nature are associated with things which are safe and friendly.

304
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:26,483
So think rolling hills, bushes, trees, that kind of thing.

305
00:16:27,724 --> 00:16:32,489
So they were used here in this particular one because this was something that the

306
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:37,294
player was going to own and so we wanted a nice welcoming experience for the player.

307
00:16:38,015 --> 00:16:43,478
So you can see that the shapes are started in the previz,

308
00:16:43,938 --> 00:16:47,480
but they have been very much enhanced by the environment.

309
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:52,803
Sorry, they've been, whoops, have some water.

310
00:16:56,945 --> 00:16:58,706
So the shapes have been very much enhanced

311
00:16:58,746 --> 00:17:00,747
by the interior artists who worked on it

312
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:02,308
and the lighting artists as well.

313
00:17:04,303 --> 00:17:08,024
So jagged shapes in nature, these are dangerous things.

314
00:17:08,264 --> 00:17:11,986
So think broken rocks, broken sticks, broken bones,

315
00:17:13,506 --> 00:17:15,827
your teeth, claws, that kind of thing.

316
00:17:16,647 --> 00:17:19,689
So we can use those shapes to create unsettling experiences

317
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:20,389
for the player.

318
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:22,890
So it was very appropriate for a combat space

319
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:25,211
where we wanted to create a tense situation.

320
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:28,112
It is exacerbated in this situation

321
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:30,873
by the top heavy nature of the architecture as well.

322
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:41,269
So horizontal and vertical shapes are about power and control and stability. So a horizontal line,

323
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:47,197
that's the horizon, so that's stable and unchanging. Vertical shapes think trees and

324
00:17:47,257 --> 00:17:52,043
cliffs, so they are powerful things but not necessarily as unchanging.

325
00:17:52,703 --> 00:17:55,744
So those shapes very much suited the storytelling

326
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,285
of the situation where the player was playing

327
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:02,586
as an office executive, and the idea was to give them

328
00:18:02,626 --> 00:18:04,606
a storytelling around power and control.

329
00:18:06,827 --> 00:18:09,768
So the shapes that end up on screen normally come

330
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:11,368
from the previz, but not always.

331
00:18:11,828 --> 00:18:15,509
As you can see here, the curving lines on the floor

332
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:17,730
are very much overriding the previz

333
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:19,610
in terms of the final shapes on screen.

334
00:18:20,895 --> 00:18:24,778
You can also override the previz with things like,

335
00:18:24,918 --> 00:18:27,460
well, textures, patterns, and the lighting as well.

336
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,581
So the shadows that you're getting from the lighting

337
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:31,922
can make incredibly strong shapes on screen.

338
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:37,406
Another thing to notice in this particular set of slides

339
00:18:38,046 --> 00:18:40,468
is that even though the architecture is very square

340
00:18:40,548 --> 00:18:43,870
in the previz, the shapes that we're getting on screen

341
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,531
are actually very soft diagonals.

342
00:18:46,412 --> 00:18:48,453
The reason for this is obviously the angle

343
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:49,994
that we're looking at the space from.

344
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:54,324
Now, when I talked before about designing around choke points

345
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:57,506
and through routes, one other thing to consider

346
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,287
is that we actually decide where those choke points

347
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,608
and through routes are going to be.

348
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:05,590
So if we'd wanted to come into the space

349
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:08,431
and make the first impression of it about power and control

350
00:19:08,472 --> 00:19:12,774
and stability, we would have come in front on to create

351
00:19:12,854 --> 00:19:14,134
square shapes on screen.

352
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:18,997
If, however, we wanted a more informal introduction

353
00:19:19,077 --> 00:19:19,697
to the space.

354
00:19:20,979 --> 00:19:22,481
and something a little bit more dynamic,

355
00:19:22,802 --> 00:19:25,306
we can come in at a slight angle like you're seeing here.

356
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:29,433
So, if you want to know more about shapes on screen,

357
00:19:29,613 --> 00:19:32,138
this here is a particularly lovely book on the topic.

358
00:19:33,897 --> 00:19:37,118
So to recap the controlling the 2D screen,

359
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:42,120
so we want to compose the 3D for how it's going to look in 2D,

360
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,541
and that is the one bit that differentiates us

361
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:45,441
from other media.

362
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:47,622
Everything else is just the advice

363
00:19:47,682 --> 00:19:49,583
that you're seeing for painting, photography,

364
00:19:49,603 --> 00:19:50,583
and cinematography.

365
00:19:50,943 --> 00:19:53,525
So that's things like creating good compositions,

366
00:19:54,225 --> 00:19:56,886
creating depth, and creating nice shapes on screen.

367
00:19:58,554 --> 00:20:00,755
So, movement. How do we control movement?

368
00:20:01,996 --> 00:20:04,797
Unfortunately, this section is going to be quite difficult,

369
00:20:04,857 --> 00:20:06,418
but if you'll just bear with me for it,

370
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,159
the last section gets easy again.

371
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,721
The reason for this is that controlling movement,

372
00:20:12,381 --> 00:20:14,322
well, the camera's attached to the player,

373
00:20:14,362 --> 00:20:17,023
so if we want to control where the camera looks and goes,

374
00:20:17,504 --> 00:20:19,885
we need to control, or at least try influence,

375
00:20:20,265 --> 00:20:21,586
where the player looks and goes.

376
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,683
So, saliency is going to control where the player looks and therefore where the camera looks.

377
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:33,086
Affordances will control where the player goes and therefore where the camera goes.

378
00:20:33,747 --> 00:20:38,970
Before I get into explaining what those terms actually mean, some quick myth busting first.

379
00:20:40,897 --> 00:20:45,599
So there is a concept in aesthetics that's been around for hundreds of years

380
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:51,323
that a strong compositional line in a painting will lead the eye through the painting. So these

381
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:57,326
are called leading lines. Now modern science has shown that this is not actually what's happening.

382
00:20:57,706 --> 00:21:01,429
What is happening is that our eyes are flicking past the compositional line

383
00:21:01,689 --> 00:21:04,951
and they're getting caught in it like a fish in a net. We're not.

384
00:21:05,491 --> 00:21:07,573
There is no directional element to it.

385
00:21:08,193 --> 00:21:10,856
Now, if our eyes are not following those composition lines,

386
00:21:11,256 --> 00:21:14,819
then we are not obviously physically following them either.

387
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:16,741
There's no directional aspect to this.

388
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,637
These lines are still incredibly good for capturing the player's attention.

389
00:21:22,138 --> 00:21:25,421
I also don't think we should throw out the concept of leading lines,

390
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:30,725
because it is very useful in terms of understanding the structure of a 2D image.

391
00:21:31,326 --> 00:21:36,230
However, it is an abstraction, sorry, it is a spatialization of an abstract concept.

392
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:39,934
So as humans, we quite often do this.

393
00:21:39,994 --> 00:21:42,496
We make spatializations of abstract concepts.

394
00:21:42,857 --> 00:21:45,419
So for example, I might refer to somebody

395
00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:47,461
as being in front of me or above me.

396
00:21:48,622 --> 00:21:51,445
That again, those are ways of spatializing

397
00:21:51,505 --> 00:21:52,485
something abstract.

398
00:21:53,006 --> 00:21:54,688
That is all that's happening here.

399
00:21:55,068 --> 00:21:56,629
By talking about leading lines,

400
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,751
we are spatializing something abstract.

401
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:02,354
It is still helpful to use, but we just

402
00:22:02,394 --> 00:22:04,035
need to remember that it's not literal,

403
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:05,756
that the player is not lit.

404
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:08,878
Their player's eyes are not literally traveling in a line.

405
00:22:09,298 --> 00:22:11,240
And therefore, we can't lead the player

406
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,921
with a strong compositional line.

407
00:22:14,922 --> 00:22:16,363
Another thing that doesn't directly

408
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:20,425
lead the player in terms of direct one-to-one,

409
00:22:20,526 --> 00:22:22,647
although it has an influence, is lighting.

410
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:26,609
So what you're looking at here is an academic study

411
00:22:26,749 --> 00:22:28,671
on visual attention in 3D games.

412
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:31,649
Now, at this moment in the study,

413
00:22:31,709 --> 00:22:33,791
the players were asked to exit the space.

414
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,915
The correct exit was behind the lit bit of wall

415
00:22:37,955 --> 00:22:38,816
that you see there.

416
00:22:39,296 --> 00:22:42,079
The players had a lot of trouble finding that exit.

417
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:44,741
They tried things like doors and fireplaces

418
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:47,984
in spite of the fact that they were in darkness.

419
00:22:49,407 --> 00:22:53,328
Now this is because we don't automatically walk

420
00:22:53,488 --> 00:22:54,268
towards the light.

421
00:22:54,468 --> 00:22:56,869
If you think again about our evolutionary heritage,

422
00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:00,430
most of our evolving happened with sunlight.

423
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,051
If you had a break in the clouds and a bit of light

424
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,951
spilling through the clouds onto the ground,

425
00:23:05,211 --> 00:23:07,452
there's absolutely no reason that our ancestors

426
00:23:07,492 --> 00:23:09,452
should be walking towards that bit of ground.

427
00:23:09,912 --> 00:23:11,813
So we have not evolved to work in that way.

428
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,588
What light can do, however, is it can help us see things that we might not otherwise see,

429
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:20,713
and it can give spatial information that we might not otherwise have.

430
00:23:21,134 --> 00:23:25,562
So it is still very useful in leading the player, but it's just not a direct one-to-one.

431
00:23:28,496 --> 00:23:30,697
So something else, and this here is,

432
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,198
I just want to give a bit of nuance on this one.

433
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:35,860
So there is a concept called weenies,

434
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,881
which a lot of you will be familiar with.

435
00:23:38,401 --> 00:23:40,622
And because every time I've given a test to this talk,

436
00:23:40,662 --> 00:23:42,023
people have asked me to spell it out.

437
00:23:42,303 --> 00:23:44,224
That's W-E-E-N-I-E-S.

438
00:23:45,025 --> 00:23:46,505
It is the German word for sausage.

439
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:50,508
The term was coined by Walt Disney,

440
00:23:50,948 --> 00:23:53,369
and the idea is that a weenie leads the guest

441
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:55,470
in the same way that a sausage leads a dog.

442
00:23:56,722 --> 00:23:58,062
Weenies absolutely work.

443
00:23:58,282 --> 00:23:59,503
Like, there's no doubt about it.

444
00:23:59,923 --> 00:24:02,924
But the reason they work is because of the mystery element.

445
00:24:03,505 --> 00:24:05,626
So weenies have two aspects to them.

446
00:24:05,706 --> 00:24:07,626
They are a landmark, and they have mystery.

447
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:10,748
A landmark by itself is incredibly useful

448
00:24:10,808 --> 00:24:13,529
and incredibly important in terms of the way

449
00:24:13,589 --> 00:24:14,610
finding for the player.

450
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,611
But if you want to actually lead the player to the landmark,

451
00:24:17,891 --> 00:24:18,952
you need to add mystery.

452
00:24:20,212 --> 00:24:21,753
I'm going to be talking about mystery later,

453
00:24:21,773 --> 00:24:23,213
so we will come back to this one.

454
00:24:24,774 --> 00:24:29,035
So myth busting over, how do we lead the player

455
00:24:29,095 --> 00:24:30,315
and therefore lead the camera?

456
00:24:31,056 --> 00:24:34,516
So saliency will control where the player looks

457
00:24:34,596 --> 00:24:35,957
and therefore where the camera looks.

458
00:24:36,397 --> 00:24:38,737
Affordances will control where the player goes

459
00:24:38,857 --> 00:24:40,258
and therefore where the camera goes.

460
00:24:41,378 --> 00:24:43,198
So let's starting with saliency.

461
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:46,519
So saliency is a scientific term which means attention.

462
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,600
So something that is highly salient

463
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,460
is something that is attention grabbing.

464
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,912
There are two types of saliency.

465
00:24:53,052 --> 00:24:54,693
We have bottom-up and top-down.

466
00:24:55,234 --> 00:24:58,776
So bottom-up saliency is all about contrast.

467
00:24:59,157 --> 00:25:02,259
So it's contrast of color, it's contrast of size,

468
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,123
contrast of shape, contrast of orientation,

469
00:25:06,683 --> 00:25:09,886
contrast of texture, and that's the bottom left-hand corner,

470
00:25:09,906 --> 00:25:13,589
that one's a bit more subtle, and contrast of movement.

471
00:25:16,341 --> 00:25:18,363
Top-down saliency, on the other hand,

472
00:25:18,423 --> 00:25:19,905
is about things which are meaningful.

473
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:23,168
So human faces are always highly salient to us

474
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:24,490
because they are meaningful to us.

475
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,013
Humans in general are always highly salient

476
00:25:27,033 --> 00:25:28,194
because, again, they are meaningful.

477
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:31,898
Things which are associated with a current task or goal,

478
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:33,460
so if I am playing a ball game,

479
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,283
then a ball shape is going to be very salient to me.

480
00:25:37,444 --> 00:25:40,268
If I'm getting ready for work, then shoe shapes will be salient.

481
00:25:40,729 --> 00:25:44,294
If I'm thirsty, then shapes associated with drinks will be salient.

482
00:25:44,755 --> 00:25:49,441
And of course, there are some things which are always salient to us because they affect things like safety.

483
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:54,138
So the final saliency, so where our attention is going,

484
00:25:54,218 --> 00:25:56,641
is a mix of both bottom-up and top-down.

485
00:25:57,663 --> 00:25:59,205
How much comes from bottom-up

486
00:25:59,285 --> 00:26:00,746
and how much comes from top-down

487
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:02,849
depends on what mode that we're in.

488
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,613
So the more we are in a task-orientated

489
00:26:05,713 --> 00:26:07,055
or goal-orientated mode,

490
00:26:07,455 --> 00:26:09,918
the more top-down saliency is dominating.

491
00:26:11,272 --> 00:26:13,093
Now, this is quite important for video games

492
00:26:13,193 --> 00:26:15,813
because obviously our players are usually

493
00:26:15,893 --> 00:26:18,754
in a very task-orientated or goal-orientated mode.

494
00:26:19,394 --> 00:26:21,834
This means that compared to other media,

495
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:24,415
the top-down saliency is going to be much stronger.

496
00:26:24,975 --> 00:26:27,035
So in film, where people are just sitting there

497
00:26:27,055 --> 00:26:29,616
and watching a film, the bottom-up saliency

498
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:33,096
will be stronger because people are just in a relaxed mode.

499
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:36,697
For our games, the top-down saliency will be stronger.

500
00:26:38,424 --> 00:26:40,225
So what you're looking at right here,

501
00:26:40,825 --> 00:26:42,506
this is an eye-tracking heat map

502
00:26:43,207 --> 00:26:46,328
that was done for an architectural study.

503
00:26:46,628 --> 00:26:48,950
So they were comparing two Photoshopped versions

504
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,870
of the same image.

505
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,272
Now, an eye-tracking heat map, for our intents and purposes,

506
00:26:53,392 --> 00:26:55,853
is identical to a saliency map.

507
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:58,775
Where people are looking is where their attention is.

508
00:26:59,235 --> 00:27:01,436
Now, this is not where they are consciously looking.

509
00:27:01,696 --> 00:27:04,157
This is where their eyes are subconsciously flicking to.

510
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:11,003
Now, what is interesting here is that the people looking at these images would not have

511
00:27:11,023 --> 00:27:14,086
been in very task-orientated or goal-orientated modes.

512
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:15,687
They were just asked to look at a picture.

513
00:27:16,248 --> 00:27:19,050
However, the top-down saliency is incredibly strong.

514
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:22,613
If you look at the image at the eaves on the top of the image...

515
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:28,758
try get that one as well, and see where they're contrasted against the sky in the background,

516
00:27:29,118 --> 00:27:34,342
that is the strongest bit of contrast in the image. So if this was about bottom-up saliency,

517
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:38,445
everybody should be looking at the eaves of the building, but nobody's looking at the eaves of

518
00:27:38,465 --> 00:27:43,589
the building. They're looking at windows and doors and the signs above the door.

519
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,531
That is because these things are meaningful.

520
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:49,118
So with a window we can see through it,

521
00:27:49,138 --> 00:27:50,762
it's also associated with people,

522
00:27:51,384 --> 00:27:54,331
the same and doors as well are associated with people

523
00:27:54,431 --> 00:27:55,774
and the sign with information.

524
00:27:58,824 --> 00:28:02,525
Okay, so if you want to know more about saliency

525
00:28:02,665 --> 00:28:05,986
and attention, unfortunately I don't have any easy reference

526
00:28:06,046 --> 00:28:06,687
with this one.

527
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:11,548
So this here is a lecture which I'm pretty sure

528
00:28:11,568 --> 00:28:13,849
was aimed at first year neuroscience students.

529
00:28:14,889 --> 00:28:15,949
So if you're anything like me,

530
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:18,370
you will not recognize a lot of the terms in the video,

531
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:21,891
but a few listen-throughs, you do start to pick things up.

532
00:28:23,192 --> 00:28:25,233
And this is a similar one as well.

533
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:27,295
Again, I'm pretty sure it's a first year lecture

534
00:28:27,335 --> 00:28:28,676
aimed at neuroscience students.

535
00:28:29,756 --> 00:28:31,838
And this was the academic study I mentioned

536
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,799
on visual attention and video games.

537
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,861
I've not seen very much on this topic.

538
00:28:35,901 --> 00:28:37,582
I mean, it might be out there, I might have just missed it,

539
00:28:37,962 --> 00:28:39,663
but this is all I've personally found.

540
00:28:41,384 --> 00:28:44,186
So, if saliency or attention is controlling

541
00:28:44,206 --> 00:28:46,128
where the player and therefore the camera looks,

542
00:28:46,628 --> 00:28:48,509
affordances are controlling where the player

543
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:49,690
and therefore the camera goes.

544
00:28:50,784 --> 00:28:54,329
So for anybody who doesn't know what affordances are,

545
00:28:54,349 --> 00:28:55,310
a quick recap.

546
00:28:55,671 --> 00:28:58,875
So affordances are the action that an object allows.

547
00:28:59,356 --> 00:29:02,099
So a chair affords sitting, a car affords driving,

548
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,763
a door affords opening, floor affords walking,

549
00:29:04,863 --> 00:29:06,265
window affords looking through.

550
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:07,266
You get the idea.

551
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:10,568
Now there is such a thing as misperceived affordances.

552
00:29:10,969 --> 00:29:13,110
This is when something looks like it does something,

553
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,090
but it actually doesn't.

554
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,171
So you might have a chair in your video game

555
00:29:16,211 --> 00:29:17,552
that looks like it affords sitting,

556
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:18,792
but you can't sit in it.

557
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:22,494
And so obviously in video games, this happens quite a lot

558
00:29:22,974 --> 00:29:24,875
because we pull shapes from the real world,

559
00:29:24,955 --> 00:29:27,616
but we don't copy all the affordances of the real world.

560
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:33,371
So one solution to this is what are called signifiers.

561
00:29:33,971 --> 00:29:36,072
So signifiers are arbitrary signals

562
00:29:36,112 --> 00:29:39,593
that the player needs to learn that communicate affordances.

563
00:29:40,353 --> 00:29:42,534
So a traffic light in the real world

564
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,815
affords the fact that you can go.

565
00:29:44,835 --> 00:29:49,157
In video games, we often use yellow lines and things

566
00:29:49,217 --> 00:29:50,998
like, and strong colors to highlight

567
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:52,318
things which are interactable.

568
00:29:52,718 --> 00:29:55,859
And signs and symbols are, of course, signifiers as well.

569
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:01,985
Now one thing to be aware of with signifiers is that they do to a certain extent break the fourth

570
00:30:02,025 --> 00:30:08,150
wall because it means we are talking directly to the player. Now this suits some games and

571
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:12,774
not others, this is entirely context dependent but it is something to be aware of.

572
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:17,876
And there is quite a bit online about video games

573
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:21,460
and affordances, so these are good places to start.

574
00:30:22,201 --> 00:30:24,964
And that there was the original book on the topic.

575
00:30:25,104 --> 00:30:27,066
This was for product design, not games,

576
00:30:27,186 --> 00:30:28,728
but the same principles apply.

577
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:33,654
So, recap over, how do affordances lead the player?

578
00:30:34,562 --> 00:30:38,306
So we're going to start with the simplest type of affordances,

579
00:30:38,326 --> 00:30:40,309
because there are many types.

580
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:44,153
You will see that the player is walking straight to the vending machine.

581
00:30:44,273 --> 00:30:46,696
It's pretty simple. So this is object affordances,

582
00:30:47,176 --> 00:30:50,520
and the player will simply move towards an object to use it.

583
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,202
It really is that simple.

584
00:30:53,243 --> 00:30:59,005
Now, it doesn't just have to be something that's a very real world affordance like this.

585
00:30:59,165 --> 00:31:05,247
It can also be affordances like a plank affords walking, a rope affords climbing, a window

586
00:31:05,287 --> 00:31:07,648
affords climbing through, a fence affords breaking.

587
00:31:08,469 --> 00:31:10,669
These are things which the player will move towards.

588
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:17,757
If it is the only affordance in the scene as well, then the player is definitely very likely to use it, to go there.

589
00:31:18,498 --> 00:31:22,002
But of course we need to make sure that we communicate that affordance to the player

590
00:31:22,283 --> 00:31:24,485
and that the player can see it and understand it.

591
00:31:26,126 --> 00:31:28,928
So, as well as simple object affordances,

592
00:31:28,968 --> 00:31:31,190
we also have surface affordances.

593
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:33,252
So when I mentioned to you before

594
00:31:33,332 --> 00:31:34,813
that a floor affords walking,

595
00:31:35,134 --> 00:31:36,555
this is a surface affordance.

596
00:31:36,955 --> 00:31:39,618
This is also something that people will walk towards,

597
00:31:39,758 --> 00:31:40,698
just like the object.

598
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:44,981
So what you're looking at here, this is two different academic studies.

599
00:31:45,762 --> 00:31:53,886
The one on your right, the white one, that was a real-world study of the Tate Gallery

600
00:31:54,386 --> 00:31:57,448
where they were tracking human movement through the Tate Gallery.

601
00:31:58,109 --> 00:32:04,152
The study on your left, on the black image, that was a digital recreation of that study.

602
00:32:05,603 --> 00:32:07,907
So what the people were trying to do

603
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:10,110
in the digital recreation,

604
00:32:10,271 --> 00:32:12,354
is they were trying to prove this idea

605
00:32:12,855 --> 00:32:15,639
that surface affordances attract people,

606
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,284
that we walk towards a walkable surface.

607
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:24,035
So what they did is they set up some very simple rules for the bots in the study.

608
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:28,779
Those bots were told that every so often they would stop and change direction.

609
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,063
The direction they were most likely to walk towards was the longest sightline.

610
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:38,288
Now in the context of this study and the Tait Gallery, a long sightline correlates with

611
00:32:38,848 --> 00:32:43,773
a larger walkable surface area, or the greater affordance of a walkable surface area.

612
00:32:44,594 --> 00:32:53,618
So, as you can, if you look closely at the white, at the bits where they're walking in the center,

613
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:59,141
so you'll notice that the shapes made by the real humans and the shapes made by the bots are very

614
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:04,424
similar. Then neither of them are walking right at the edge of the space and we're also not getting

615
00:33:04,464 --> 00:33:06,305
a very narrow channel down the center.

616
00:33:07,566 --> 00:33:09,789
we're getting very similar shape of movement.

617
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:14,615
This shows that we as humans do walk towards

618
00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:18,119
a walkable surface area that the bots did,

619
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,302
that the rules the bots had did correlate

620
00:33:21,382 --> 00:33:22,243
with human movement.

621
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:28,859
So, it is worth remembering that in the context of this Tate Gallery study, that there was

622
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:31,343
not much else going on in terms of affordances.

623
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:39,194
Obviously, most real environments have more types of affordances, which would complicate

624
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:39,374
this.

625
00:33:41,818 --> 00:33:45,741
So, as well as object affordances and surface affordances,

626
00:33:45,801 --> 00:33:47,682
we also have complex affordances.

627
00:33:48,223 --> 00:33:49,944
And again, these are attracting the player,

628
00:33:50,044 --> 00:33:52,846
we're concerned with these attracting the player

629
00:33:52,886 --> 00:33:54,687
because the camera is attached to the player.

630
00:33:55,308 --> 00:33:56,549
Yeah, so, as I was saying,

631
00:33:56,569 --> 00:33:58,330
so we have complex affordances here.

632
00:33:59,189 --> 00:34:02,832
So I sent out a tweet with this particular view,

633
00:34:03,673 --> 00:34:06,336
asking people, if this was a video game, where would you go?

634
00:34:06,356 --> 00:34:09,339
I had just been reading the Tate Gallery study at the time.

635
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:12,122
So in my head, everyone was going off to the right

636
00:34:12,562 --> 00:34:14,844
towards the greatest walkable surface affordance.

637
00:34:15,865 --> 00:34:18,808
The responses I got are, I'm sure what every single one of you

638
00:34:18,828 --> 00:34:19,669
are thinking right now.

639
00:34:20,089 --> 00:34:22,292
If this is a video game, I'm going up the alleyway

640
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:22,932
to the side.

641
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:31,057
Yes, so after a bit of rethinking and recalibrating on that one, what I eventually figured out

642
00:34:31,117 --> 00:34:36,180
was what is going on here is that we have created a complex affordance that we have

643
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:36,981
taught the player.

644
00:34:37,421 --> 00:34:42,824
The signifier of this is a small alleyway or a side path, and the affordance is some

645
00:34:42,864 --> 00:34:44,145
kind of gameplay reward.

646
00:34:44,525 --> 00:34:49,548
So that might be a treasure chest, or it might be a way to flank enemies, or some new areas

647
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:50,149
to discover.

648
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,703
So yes, in a video game, the greatest affordance with this

649
00:34:54,903 --> 00:34:56,705
is the small alleyway or side path,

650
00:34:56,985 --> 00:34:58,506
so people are going in that direction.

651
00:34:59,127 --> 00:35:02,270
In real life, it is still the road to the right,

652
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,672
because we don't have treasure chests in real life.

653
00:35:05,933 --> 00:35:07,114
So, it's a shame.

654
00:35:08,996 --> 00:35:14,879
So, as well as object affordances, surface affordances, and complex affordances, we also

655
00:35:14,939 --> 00:35:16,380
have spatial affordances.

656
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,662
So there is a concept in architecture called prospect and refuge.

657
00:35:21,122 --> 00:35:23,623
Prospect is a view and refuge is safety.

658
00:35:24,103 --> 00:35:28,605
So this particular image, I would describe it as being very strong prospect, but maybe

659
00:35:28,685 --> 00:35:29,766
medium refuge.

660
00:35:30,999 --> 00:35:34,481
So this here, this is also prospector refuge.

661
00:35:34,921 --> 00:35:37,083
The prospect isn't quite as strong.

662
00:35:37,163 --> 00:35:40,004
There is a view, but it's not as epic as the previous one.

663
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:42,206
But the refuge is much stronger.

664
00:35:42,366 --> 00:35:45,428
This space feels much safer and much more protected.

665
00:35:46,873 --> 00:35:52,275
This is also both prospect and refuge, but from where we are further back a bit,

666
00:35:52,835 --> 00:35:57,977
the prospect is quite low, there's not that much we can see, but the refuge is incredibly strong.

667
00:35:58,897 --> 00:36:05,040
Obviously for the soldier who is right in the window, they have both very strong prospect and very strong refuge.

668
00:36:13,242 --> 00:36:17,864
Okay, so there are two types of prospect and refuge

669
00:36:17,904 --> 00:36:19,164
in the architectural literature.

670
00:36:19,605 --> 00:36:21,646
There is primary prospect and refuge

671
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:23,286
and secondary prospect and refuge.

672
00:36:23,727 --> 00:36:26,068
So this here is secondary prospect and refuge.

673
00:36:26,088 --> 00:36:27,989
I'm just gonna jump back some slides

674
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:29,810
because I shouldn't have moved quite yet.

675
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,451
These here are all primary prospect and refuge.

676
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:38,134
So primary prospect and refuge is when we have a view

677
00:36:38,214 --> 00:36:39,254
where we are right now

678
00:36:39,374 --> 00:36:41,275
and we have safety where we are right now.

679
00:36:42,436 --> 00:36:44,697
So these are all primary prospect and refuge.

680
00:36:45,217 --> 00:36:48,079
Secondary prospect and refuge is when we can see a spot

681
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:53,242
in front of us that would afford prospect or afford refuge,

682
00:36:53,762 --> 00:36:54,863
but we don't have it right now.

683
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:57,484
So we know that if we went up to that castle,

684
00:36:57,864 --> 00:36:59,505
we would have a view from that castle

685
00:36:59,565 --> 00:37:01,286
and we would have safety in that castle.

686
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:03,387
That is secondary prospect and refuge.

687
00:37:04,008 --> 00:37:06,049
As humans, we like prospect and refuge,

688
00:37:06,129 --> 00:37:08,270
and so this is something that we will walk towards.

689
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:12,578
Now this, by the way, is again about our evolutionary heritage.

690
00:37:12,938 --> 00:37:14,820
The reason we like prospect and refuge

691
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,982
is because this kept our ancestors safe.

692
00:37:17,423 --> 00:37:20,726
The ancestors who liked prospect spaces and refuge spaces

693
00:37:21,087 --> 00:37:23,870
were the ancestors who were more likely to survive and have us.

694
00:37:25,471 --> 00:37:27,273
So this has a very interesting effect

695
00:37:27,393 --> 00:37:28,675
on the movement in a space.

696
00:37:29,752 --> 00:37:32,714
So you can see this particular interior here.

697
00:37:33,395 --> 00:37:39,400
There is very weak, or there's no primary prospector refuge,

698
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,203
but there is a lot of very small implied

699
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:44,824
secondary prospector refuge.

700
00:37:45,244 --> 00:37:47,066
The player is constantly being promised

701
00:37:47,086 --> 00:37:48,567
there might be a view around the corner.

702
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:51,790
Maybe the next pillar's going to offer safety.

703
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,692
What this does is make the player move.

704
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,894
So again, we're concerned with the player moving

705
00:37:56,914 --> 00:37:58,335
because the camera's attached to our player.

706
00:37:58,675 --> 00:38:01,856
So you will get a lot of very fast fluid movement

707
00:38:01,876 --> 00:38:02,596
through the space.

708
00:38:04,037 --> 00:38:07,337
This is in contrast to very strong

709
00:38:07,557 --> 00:38:09,098
primary prospector refuge.

710
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:14,419
So here we have a very strong view and a very strong safety.

711
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:16,099
And please ignore that plant, by the way.

712
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:18,040
This was the best example I could find.

713
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,520
I just wish I didn't have the plant.

714
00:38:20,561 --> 00:38:22,581
But yeah, you can see that they're not moving.

715
00:38:23,102 --> 00:38:25,583
They have very strong primary prospect and refuge.

716
00:38:25,963 --> 00:38:29,865
There is no promise of secondary prospect or refuge anywhere.

717
00:38:30,465 --> 00:38:32,786
There's nowhere that it looks like you would have

718
00:38:32,826 --> 00:38:34,227
a better view if you moved there,

719
00:38:34,547 --> 00:38:36,108
and nowhere that it looks like you would have

720
00:38:36,148 --> 00:38:37,568
better safety if you moved there.

721
00:38:38,009 --> 00:38:39,389
So the player is just not moving.

722
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,631
And when they do eventually move like they have now,

723
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:43,752
they're moving slower.

724
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:46,314
Now, this is neither good nor bad.

725
00:38:46,414 --> 00:38:49,516
This is simply about controlling the type of player movement

726
00:38:49,556 --> 00:38:51,498
and therefore camera movement that you're after.

727
00:38:52,807 --> 00:38:54,848
Another thing to be aware of between the two

728
00:38:55,108 --> 00:38:57,910
is actually the amount of walkable surface area in view.

729
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,611
In this one here, where we have the much faster,

730
00:39:00,651 --> 00:39:03,373
more fluid camera movement,

731
00:39:03,513 --> 00:39:07,755
we have a lot more walkable surface area in view,

732
00:39:08,836 --> 00:39:10,917
as compared to this one here,

733
00:39:11,237 --> 00:39:14,058
where there is very little walkable surface area in view.

734
00:39:14,299 --> 00:39:16,880
So the difference between the movement in these two spaces

735
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,781
is both the prospect and refuge,

736
00:39:20,222 --> 00:39:22,223
as well as the walkable surface area.

737
00:39:23,888 --> 00:39:26,991
So, if you want to know more about Prospector Refuge,

738
00:39:27,071 --> 00:39:28,372
this here is the book to go to.

739
00:39:28,832 --> 00:39:30,114
This is an architecture book.

740
00:39:30,874 --> 00:39:32,396
So, and as I said before,

741
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,277
this is about our evolutionary heritage.

742
00:39:34,578 --> 00:39:37,000
So, this is not just tactics for shooter games.

743
00:39:37,661 --> 00:39:39,782
This is how we have evolved.

744
00:39:40,763 --> 00:39:44,006
So, these principles can be used in nonviolent games,

745
00:39:44,327 --> 00:39:45,468
and they can also be used

746
00:39:45,548 --> 00:39:48,110
in nonviolent moments of action games.

747
00:39:49,895 --> 00:39:51,856
So as we talked about before,

748
00:39:52,096 --> 00:39:54,056
mystery also attracts the player.

749
00:39:54,696 --> 00:39:57,017
How this is working in terms of affordances

750
00:39:57,557 --> 00:40:01,638
is that the affordance is that there is information

751
00:40:01,678 --> 00:40:02,558
for us to learn.

752
00:40:03,078 --> 00:40:06,019
As humans, we very much like learning information.

753
00:40:06,799 --> 00:40:11,280
So what is going on here is that the castle in this case

754
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,820
is promising us that if we move closer,

755
00:40:14,381 --> 00:40:15,681
there will be more for us to learn.

756
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:22,126
Now how it is doing it in this particular situation is with the very interesting profile and with the

757
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:28,011
extra detail on the architecture that tells us that there is stuff to discover if we get closer.

758
00:40:28,611 --> 00:40:33,215
The secondary prospect that I was talking about before, that is also about mystery.

759
00:40:33,535 --> 00:40:38,619
If we move closer to that spot we will get a view and of course a view is information.

760
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:44,682
So as well as simple object affordances,

761
00:40:45,062 --> 00:40:47,244
surface affordances, complex affordances,

762
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:51,707
and spatial affordances, we also have wayfinding elements.

763
00:40:52,288 --> 00:40:55,871
So a quick recap here for anyone who doesn't know.

764
00:40:56,551 --> 00:40:58,533
So there are five types of wayfinding elements.

765
00:40:59,033 --> 00:41:00,374
We have landmarks.

766
00:41:00,614 --> 00:41:02,856
These are individual objects which stand out.

767
00:41:03,236 --> 00:41:06,038
So think a church spire or a mountain.

768
00:41:06,999 --> 00:41:07,980
We have districts.

769
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,203
Districts are areas with their own flavour.

770
00:41:11,403 --> 00:41:15,126
So think Chinatown, the Wharf, Central Business District,

771
00:41:15,226 --> 00:41:15,927
that kind of thing.

772
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:20,311
Linear elements are, or paths, sorry,

773
00:41:20,651 --> 00:41:22,773
are linear elements which afford movement.

774
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:25,716
So think a path, obviously, but also a road.

775
00:41:26,096 --> 00:41:28,898
If you're in a boat, then a river would be a path.

776
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,000
If you're in a car, then a motorway.

777
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:36,081
So edges are linear elements which prevent movement.

778
00:41:36,341 --> 00:41:37,742
So think of a wharf.

779
00:41:38,442 --> 00:41:39,683
Also think again of the river,

780
00:41:39,743 --> 00:41:42,725
but this time if you're traveling in a car.

781
00:41:43,526 --> 00:41:44,866
And think again of a motorway,

782
00:41:44,906 --> 00:41:46,868
but this time if you're traveling on foot.

783
00:41:47,468 --> 00:41:49,489
So these are very context dependent

784
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:50,750
in terms of how you're traveling.

785
00:41:52,064 --> 00:41:53,185
And then we have nodes.

786
00:41:53,766 --> 00:41:56,209
Nodes are moments of decision or choice.

787
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:00,114
So think of an intersection, a town square,

788
00:42:00,594 --> 00:42:03,718
but also think of things like a airport or a train station.

789
00:42:04,919 --> 00:42:06,541
So this

790
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:11,450
As I mentioned before, wayfinding elements

791
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,570
don't directly lead the player,

792
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:17,231
but they do affect the mental map the players have,

793
00:42:17,311 --> 00:42:19,872
and that mental map affects where the players will go.

794
00:42:20,612 --> 00:42:22,372
So to give you an example,

795
00:42:22,913 --> 00:42:24,873
if you were to give someone direction

796
00:42:24,933 --> 00:42:26,673
somewhere pre-Google map days,

797
00:42:27,334 --> 00:42:28,654
you might say something like this.

798
00:42:29,274 --> 00:42:31,175
Follow this road till you get to the tree.

799
00:42:31,635 --> 00:42:32,815
At the tree, turn left.

800
00:42:32,995 --> 00:42:35,296
Once you cross the river, it's the red door on your right.

801
00:42:36,376 --> 00:42:38,496
There, I just used wayfinding elements.

802
00:42:39,117 --> 00:42:41,398
So the road that we were on was a path,

803
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:43,100
the tree was a landmark,

804
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,421
the river that we crossed was an edge,

805
00:42:45,882 --> 00:42:48,664
and the red door was another landmark at a different scale.

806
00:42:49,384 --> 00:42:51,246
So what we're doing is we are structuring

807
00:42:51,286 --> 00:42:52,627
our understanding of a space

808
00:42:52,787 --> 00:42:54,088
around these different elements.

809
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,010
And it is our understanding of a space

810
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,912
that will affect how we move through a space.

811
00:42:59,573 --> 00:43:02,755
Now this is absolutely something that could easily

812
00:43:02,816 --> 00:43:04,277
be a whole talk in its own right,

813
00:43:04,297 --> 00:43:05,438
so I'm going to leave it there.

814
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:09,061
But if you want to know more about wayfinding elements,

815
00:43:09,682 --> 00:43:12,144
this here is the book that those originally come from.

816
00:43:12,804 --> 00:43:16,628
And there's quite a lot of interesting modern science

817
00:43:17,488 --> 00:43:20,071
on how we do spatial mapping.

818
00:43:20,451 --> 00:43:22,633
So that there is a particularly good article.

819
00:43:23,154 --> 00:43:24,455
There was also a talk on Monday,

820
00:43:24,515 --> 00:43:26,857
which unfortunately you've missed if you didn't go to it,

821
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:28,559
but I'm sure it'll be on the vault.

822
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,263
But yeah, that was also a good talk on spatial mapping.

823
00:43:34,147 --> 00:43:36,129
So to recap the movement section,

824
00:43:36,729 --> 00:43:40,752
so saliency or attention will control

825
00:43:40,772 --> 00:43:43,314
where the player looks and therefore where the camera looks.

826
00:43:43,534 --> 00:43:45,135
We had two types of saliency.

827
00:43:45,175 --> 00:43:47,077
We had bottom-up and we had top-down.

828
00:43:47,977 --> 00:43:50,379
And again, the top-down saliency is stronger

829
00:43:50,859 --> 00:43:55,903
when people are in a task-orientated or goal-orientated mode.

830
00:43:56,684 --> 00:44:01,267
Affordances are controlling where the player goes and therefore where the camera goes.

831
00:44:01,887 --> 00:44:08,172
So we had simple object affordances, surface affordances, complex affordances,

832
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:10,573
spatial affordances and wayfinding elements.

833
00:44:12,262 --> 00:44:15,144
So, moving on to the final section, now time.

834
00:44:15,604 --> 00:44:18,986
So, time in film would normally be controlled

835
00:44:19,046 --> 00:44:20,568
with the camera or with editing.

836
00:44:21,108 --> 00:44:23,930
For us, we obviously aren't directly controlling

837
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,851
the camera apart from what control we,

838
00:44:26,632 --> 00:44:28,073
what guidance we can give the player,

839
00:44:28,953 --> 00:44:31,035
and we don't have editing outside of cut scenes.

840
00:44:32,516 --> 00:44:34,978
Luckily for us, space is experienced over time.

841
00:44:34,998 --> 00:44:35,038
So,

842
00:44:37,189 --> 00:44:39,811
When I take in this room, I don't take it all in

843
00:44:39,951 --> 00:44:41,592
in one instant, in one moment.

844
00:44:41,712 --> 00:44:44,014
I take it in because my eye is traveling over it

845
00:44:44,134 --> 00:44:45,735
or I'm physically walking through it,

846
00:44:46,095 --> 00:44:48,477
or in a video game, my avatar might be walking through it.

847
00:44:49,017 --> 00:44:51,719
This means that what is laid out over space

848
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,681
is actually experienced over time.

849
00:44:54,081 --> 00:44:56,082
So we can set things up in space

850
00:44:56,163 --> 00:44:58,184
that we want to be experienced over time.

851
00:45:00,246 --> 00:45:03,328
One major element of this is repetition and rhythm.

852
00:45:03,908 --> 00:45:06,270
So in film, they would often do editing

853
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:09,191
to get different types of rhythm.

854
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,432
So you might have much faster editing

855
00:45:11,813 --> 00:45:13,994
to create an intense moment in the film.

856
00:45:15,275 --> 00:45:21,079
So we can set up rhythm with architectural repetition.

857
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,242
So repeating elements architecturally

858
00:45:24,502 --> 00:45:26,824
will be experienced as a rhythm over time.

859
00:45:27,505 --> 00:45:29,726
So if you look at these columns here,

860
00:45:29,906 --> 00:45:32,368
you don't again take them in all in one instant

861
00:45:32,408 --> 00:45:33,049
in one moment.

862
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:36,072
You take them in over time as your eye travels over them.

863
00:45:36,593 --> 00:45:41,237
We can change the layout of that rhythm,

864
00:45:41,658 --> 00:45:46,203
of the architecture, to change the type of rhythm

865
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:46,763
we're getting.

866
00:45:46,964 --> 00:45:49,246
Now that is easiest explained on a little mock-up.

867
00:45:49,927 --> 00:45:53,729
So you can see that the columns on the left

868
00:45:54,730 --> 00:45:56,991
are much closer together than the columns on the right

869
00:45:57,051 --> 00:46:00,514
and create a much more intense rhythm than the columns

870
00:46:00,554 --> 00:46:01,034
on the right.

871
00:46:01,394 --> 00:46:04,676
So we can change the density over space

872
00:46:05,237 --> 00:46:07,818
to affect the intensity over time.

873
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,201
So for more on the architectural side of this,

874
00:46:12,341 --> 00:46:14,183
this here is a particularly good book.

875
00:46:15,621 --> 00:46:18,265
Now, as with anything that involves intensity,

876
00:46:18,325 --> 00:46:20,689
this is something that we want to change over time.

877
00:46:21,955 --> 00:46:24,497
So to be constantly at high intensity

878
00:46:24,537 --> 00:46:26,498
can get a little bit overwhelming for the player,

879
00:46:27,218 --> 00:46:29,039
and they can also become numb to it.

880
00:46:29,939 --> 00:46:32,981
And to be at a low intensity constantly

881
00:46:33,381 --> 00:46:34,501
can become a bit boring.

882
00:46:34,742 --> 00:46:36,242
So we want to change things up.

883
00:46:36,743 --> 00:46:39,604
And again, changing things up in terms of intensity

884
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:41,485
over time means changing things up

885
00:46:41,605 --> 00:46:43,566
in terms of density over space.

886
00:46:44,006 --> 00:46:47,508
So we don't want to have the same kind of layouts

887
00:46:47,608 --> 00:46:50,309
and patterns throughout our spaces.

888
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,250
We want to vary them.

889
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:54,731
So as well as rhythm and repetition,

890
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:56,532
we also want to think about transitions.

891
00:46:57,172 --> 00:46:59,473
So in film, this would be how you go

892
00:46:59,513 --> 00:47:00,734
from one shot to the next.

893
00:47:01,194 --> 00:47:03,535
So that might be a cut or it might be a dissolve,

894
00:47:04,635 --> 00:47:07,436
or a few other things as well, but those are the main ones.

895
00:47:07,876 --> 00:47:11,898
So again, for us, what is happening over space

896
00:47:11,958 --> 00:47:13,279
is experienced over time.

897
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:16,680
So we can do this through our spatial layouts.

898
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,744
So the classic example here would be Disneyland.

899
00:47:21,325 --> 00:47:24,208
So what they do when you go between spaces in Disneyland

900
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,731
is they create stylistic transitions.

901
00:47:27,472 --> 00:47:28,473
So what you're looking at,

902
00:47:28,733 --> 00:47:31,176
the red arrows are elements of one style.

903
00:47:31,196 --> 00:47:33,418
It is a little bit hard to see, I'm afraid,

904
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:35,280
but you can always go to Disneyland.

905
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:35,901
See?

906
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,482
Yeah.

907
00:47:38,162 --> 00:47:41,203
So the red elements are, the red arrows

908
00:47:41,243 --> 00:47:42,904
are pointing to elements of one style,

909
00:47:43,044 --> 00:47:44,825
the yellow to elements of the other style.

910
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,526
So they're things like lamp posts and handrails

911
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,486
and stuff like that that it's pointing to.

912
00:47:49,586 --> 00:47:51,667
And the orange one doesn't fit either.

913
00:47:52,628 --> 00:47:55,290
As you can see, there isn't an abrupt transition.

914
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:00,033
They slowly stop one and introduce another.

915
00:48:00,193 --> 00:48:02,315
So there are moments right in the middle there

916
00:48:02,695 --> 00:48:05,237
where you actually get lampposts of one style

917
00:48:05,617 --> 00:48:08,219
that are sitting over the top of handrails of another style.

918
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:12,643
So they are creating stylistic dissolves between area.

919
00:48:12,763 --> 00:48:15,665
And again, they're laying them out over space,

920
00:48:16,105 --> 00:48:17,646
but they are experienced over time.

921
00:48:19,332 --> 00:48:21,594
So we can do this architecturally as well.

922
00:48:22,355 --> 00:48:24,358
So what you're looking at here,

923
00:48:24,418 --> 00:48:27,822
so this was done for the After Hours DLC.

924
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:32,167
So these two very different architectural styles

925
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:33,769
that you're looking at, pardon me.

926
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:38,103
They were supposed to belong to the same space.

927
00:48:38,823 --> 00:48:41,846
So the first one, the reason we used

928
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:44,228
the post and beam industrial style architecture

929
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,349
was because this was supposed to be a club

930
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,631
and this was the kind of spaces

931
00:48:49,532 --> 00:48:51,814
that you saw in those types of clubs.

932
00:48:52,835 --> 00:48:56,418
However, the final one with the curving architectural style,

933
00:48:56,618 --> 00:48:57,559
sorry, I need some water here.

934
00:49:01,384 --> 00:49:01,544
Yeah.

935
00:49:02,365 --> 00:49:05,248
So the final one, so this curving architectural style,

936
00:49:05,288 --> 00:49:09,031
the reason for that was that it was a storage space

937
00:49:09,432 --> 00:49:11,634
and it would just be incredibly boring

938
00:49:11,674 --> 00:49:13,676
to have a post and beam architectural style

939
00:49:13,716 --> 00:49:15,217
for a storage space.

940
00:49:15,738 --> 00:49:17,740
And we try very much not to do boring.

941
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:22,863
So what the architect who worked on this, what she did,

942
00:49:23,364 --> 00:49:27,766
was she created a transitional area between the two.

943
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:32,729
So the office area, which sat between these two spaces,

944
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:36,431
we had, well, she had created,

945
00:49:37,872 --> 00:49:40,634
she had both elements from both styles.

946
00:49:40,694 --> 00:49:41,634
So there were the curves

947
00:49:41,774 --> 00:49:43,415
and there were the post and beam elements.

948
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:45,777
And now suddenly the spaces actually feel

949
00:49:45,797 --> 00:49:46,797
like they belong together.

950
00:49:48,432 --> 00:49:52,095
So for more on different types of ways

951
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:53,876
you can transition architecturally,

952
00:49:54,737 --> 00:49:56,278
this here is the book to go to.

953
00:49:56,739 --> 00:49:58,400
This is definitely a book to dip into

954
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,282
rather than to try read cover to cover.

955
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,864
Luckily for us with architecture,

956
00:50:02,904 --> 00:50:05,526
we actually have a lot more options here compared to film.

957
00:50:07,548 --> 00:50:08,909
To give you another example,

958
00:50:09,029 --> 00:50:11,011
if you were to say walk into a building

959
00:50:11,051 --> 00:50:12,072
straight off the street,

960
00:50:12,212 --> 00:50:15,034
so there's just a door directly on the street,

961
00:50:15,094 --> 00:50:16,475
that would be the equivalent of a cut.

962
00:50:17,256 --> 00:50:21,800
If you added some elements like a veranda or similar between the door and the street,

963
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:25,983
you would create more of a dissolve. There are a lot, and I do mean a lot,

964
00:50:26,103 --> 00:50:31,248
of different ways we can move between spaces architecturally. And yes, that's the book to go to.

965
00:50:32,248 --> 00:50:34,010
So, to recap the whole talk now.

966
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:39,714
So we were looking at the fact that even though we can't control the camera,

967
00:50:40,014 --> 00:50:42,757
we can control the environment that the player moves through.

968
00:50:43,137 --> 00:50:48,322
This means that we can create cinematic experiences by controlling the environment.

969
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:53,904
So with the 2D screen, we are composing the 3D

970
00:50:54,004 --> 00:50:55,605
for how it looks in 2D.

971
00:50:55,745 --> 00:50:57,847
That was the main thing that was, oh, thank you.

972
00:50:58,768 --> 00:51:00,829
That was the main thing that was differentiating us

973
00:51:00,869 --> 00:51:03,211
from other media, and beyond that,

974
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:06,193
everything else was just the normal advice

975
00:51:06,213 --> 00:51:07,434
that you get in other media.

976
00:51:07,855 --> 00:51:09,616
So it was creating good compositions,

977
00:51:09,676 --> 00:51:10,737
it was creating depth,

978
00:51:10,797 --> 00:51:12,638
and it was creating nice shapes on screen.

979
00:51:14,584 --> 00:51:16,666
With the movement section,

980
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:19,048
that was about saliency and affordances.

981
00:51:19,628 --> 00:51:21,970
So saliency is controlling where the player is

982
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:23,912
looking and therefore where the camera is looking.

983
00:51:24,352 --> 00:51:26,854
We had bottom-up saliency and top-down saliency.

984
00:51:27,314 --> 00:51:30,237
Affordances are controlling where the player is going,

985
00:51:30,317 --> 00:51:31,858
and therefore where the camera is going.

986
00:51:32,158 --> 00:51:34,480
For that, we had object affordances,

987
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,262
surface affordances, spatial affordances,

988
00:51:37,883 --> 00:51:39,224
and wayfinding elements.

989
00:51:39,644 --> 00:51:42,225
With time, space is experienced over time,

990
00:51:42,626 --> 00:51:44,947
so we can set up spatially what we want

991
00:51:44,987 --> 00:51:46,467
to be experienced over time.

992
00:51:47,148 --> 00:51:49,629
So this was rhythm and repetition

993
00:51:49,649 --> 00:51:50,750
was one of the main elements,

994
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:53,111
but also controlling our transitions.

995
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:56,873
Yeah, so this is the end of the talk,

996
00:51:57,093 --> 00:52:00,154
and that's the promised list of references.

997
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:01,095
Oh.

998
00:52:11,662 --> 00:52:12,943
And we've got about eight minutes.

999
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:16,346
Questions?

1000
00:52:25,473 --> 00:52:26,914
Thank you, thank you, excellent talk.

1001
00:52:27,374 --> 00:52:31,217
I have a question, like, if you apply the same principles

1002
00:52:31,277 --> 00:52:32,458
to something like VR.

1003
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,000
To what, sorry?

1004
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,561
Like a virtual reality, you know,

1005
00:52:36,661 --> 00:52:39,383
so would you just throw away the 2D screen?

1006
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,761
Yeah, I think everything else would work,

1007
00:52:41,861 --> 00:52:43,582
but definitely the stuff on the 2D screen

1008
00:52:43,622 --> 00:52:44,723
wouldn't be as relevant.

1009
00:52:45,524 --> 00:52:45,884
Oh, sorry.

1010
00:52:46,244 --> 00:52:50,247
So would this apply to virtual reality as well?

1011
00:52:50,347 --> 00:52:54,150
So most of it would apply, just not the 2D screen section.

1012
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:55,911
Yeah.

1013
00:52:55,971 --> 00:52:56,872
Any other questions?

1014
00:52:59,894 --> 00:53:00,074
Nope.

1015
00:53:01,075 --> 00:53:01,375
Sorry.

1016
00:53:01,735 --> 00:53:02,916
OK.

1017
00:53:03,256 --> 00:53:04,557
Just tripping over everything.

1018
00:53:06,176 --> 00:53:07,557
Yes, wonderful talk.

1019
00:53:07,577 --> 00:53:11,219
I was just curious about choke points as we were beginning,

1020
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:13,140
and I was trying to think of other examples

1021
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,901
aside from tight hallways.

1022
00:53:15,281 --> 00:53:19,184
Then I saw that last slide of yours about transitions,

1023
00:53:19,244 --> 00:53:22,366
and I was curious, is it possible to have a overlap in that?

1024
00:53:22,426 --> 00:53:26,428
Can contrast between rooms and transitions between those rooms,

1025
00:53:26,488 --> 00:53:28,770
could that also be considered a choke point?

1026
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:30,971
Absolutely. A choke point, sorry,

1027
00:53:32,852 --> 00:53:33,973
How do I describe that question?

1028
00:53:34,053 --> 00:53:36,594
So is there an overlap between the transitions

1029
00:53:36,634 --> 00:53:38,294
between spaces and choke points?

1030
00:53:38,434 --> 00:53:38,734
Ah, yeah.

1031
00:53:38,834 --> 00:53:40,955
Yeah, so absolutely.

1032
00:53:41,095 --> 00:53:44,416
So a choke point is simply a spot

1033
00:53:44,476 --> 00:53:46,077
where you know the player is going to be,

1034
00:53:46,237 --> 00:53:48,418
and so transitions can help you know

1035
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:49,498
where that spot will be.

1036
00:53:50,419 --> 00:53:53,540
You can also do it with props and stuff as well.

1037
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,240
It doesn't just need to be architecture.

1038
00:53:56,081 --> 00:53:57,101
Did that answer the question?

1039
00:53:57,121 --> 00:53:58,181
Yes, very well, thank you.

1040
00:53:58,241 --> 00:53:58,582
Thank you.

1041
00:54:01,423 --> 00:54:01,543
Hi.

1042
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,001
First, great talk.

1043
00:54:04,761 --> 00:54:08,282
So my question is, the footage you showed,

1044
00:54:08,402 --> 00:54:11,844
are those are gathered from artistic meetings

1045
00:54:12,084 --> 00:54:14,324
or carried out by QA teams?

1046
00:54:15,765 --> 00:54:18,146
That was just the, so the question was,

1047
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:20,407
the footage I showed, where is it from?

1048
00:54:20,727 --> 00:54:22,607
And that's just normal players playing the game.

1049
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:25,508
So it's not QA, it's, yeah.

1050
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:28,069
And how are those used for evaluation

1051
00:54:28,209 --> 00:54:32,471
and how do you evaluate whether it's effective or not?

1052
00:54:33,345 --> 00:54:34,126
Sorry, can you repeat?

1053
00:54:34,766 --> 00:54:38,751
How do you evaluate the effectiveness of the conversation

1054
00:54:38,931 --> 00:54:40,313
based on the footage you gathered?

1055
00:54:43,816 --> 00:54:45,578
So how do we evaluate the footage?

1056
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,742
Is that the basic question?

1057
00:54:48,802 --> 00:54:51,565
Yeah, my question is kind of how do you integrate this

1058
00:54:51,865 --> 00:54:55,249
into the pipeline and based on different iteration?

1059
00:54:56,142 --> 00:54:58,243
So how do we integrate this into the pipeline?

1060
00:54:58,283 --> 00:55:01,684
So this is often about analyzing what we've done

1061
00:55:01,804 --> 00:55:05,646
in the previous pack and trying to take lessons from it

1062
00:55:05,726 --> 00:55:07,727
and then incorporate that in the next design.

1063
00:55:07,867 --> 00:55:09,448
So it's very much a learning process.

1064
00:55:10,489 --> 00:55:13,370
Sometimes if there's stuff that we're seeing,

1065
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:16,852
say in the playtest footage from the game design

1066
00:55:16,932 --> 00:55:18,152
that we notice something off,

1067
00:55:19,033 --> 00:55:21,214
we might be able to change it in the current pack,

1068
00:55:21,394 --> 00:55:23,795
but normally it's about learning from past experience

1069
00:55:23,835 --> 00:55:24,896
and applying it next time.

1070
00:55:25,476 --> 00:55:25,816
Is that it?

1071
00:55:25,896 --> 00:55:26,797
Okay, thank you.

1072
00:55:27,677 --> 00:55:30,118
Oh, anything else or are we done?

1073
00:55:31,479 --> 00:55:32,179
Oh, thank you very much.

1074
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:32,339
Oh, okay.

1075
00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:33,560
How do you deal with the designer side of it?

1076
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:33,660
Okay.

1077
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,322
There's tables and everything.

1078
00:55:39,563 --> 00:55:42,364
Yeah, so the question was how do we deal with the designer?

1079
00:55:42,664 --> 00:55:44,365
How do we deal with the designer side of it?

1080
00:55:44,765 --> 00:55:47,086
Yeah.

1081
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,087
So.

1082
00:55:49,728 --> 00:55:50,649
We talk to them a lot.

1083
00:55:51,069 --> 00:55:53,631
So yeah, it's as simple as that.

1084
00:55:53,771 --> 00:55:57,873
So the briefs that we'll get can be anything from something

1085
00:55:57,933 --> 00:56:01,616
as simple as this needs to be a place where the player defends

1086
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:04,597
to a very detailed list of everything they want.

1087
00:56:05,158 --> 00:56:07,279
So we will, when it's a brief brief,

1088
00:56:07,319 --> 00:56:09,400
we might flesh it out and take it back to them.

1089
00:56:10,021 --> 00:56:12,422
And so when we feel like we've got a brief we can work off,

1090
00:56:12,862 --> 00:56:14,243
and we'll communicate that brief to them.

1091
00:56:14,803 --> 00:56:16,484
And we'll normally communicate as well,

1092
00:56:16,524 --> 00:56:18,885
like initial design ideas, like I'll show them reference,

1093
00:56:19,025 --> 00:56:20,905
this is the kind of space that I think you're doing,

1094
00:56:21,305 --> 00:56:22,165
will that work for you?

1095
00:56:22,405 --> 00:56:23,346
And they'll say yes or no.

1096
00:56:24,166 --> 00:56:26,066
And then, yeah, we show them as we work.

1097
00:56:26,567 --> 00:56:28,647
Like we show them more when it's something difficult

1098
00:56:28,707 --> 00:56:30,027
or complicated, if it's straightforward,

1099
00:56:30,067 --> 00:56:30,768
we might just do it.

1100
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:32,828
But yeah, and then when they get it,

1101
00:56:32,868 --> 00:56:34,509
they're play testing it and they're asking

1102
00:56:34,529 --> 00:56:35,689
for any changes they need.

1103
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:38,290
So that's, yeah, it works.

1104
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:40,050
Yeah.

1105
00:56:42,235 --> 00:56:48,643
Thank you for the talk. Would you have some advice for a more open world?

1106
00:56:49,224 --> 00:56:59,518
I'm thinking about, for example, Red Dead Redemption, where at choke points sometimes when the player has a lot of opportunity to wander around in the wilderness and to come up.

1107
00:57:00,339 --> 00:57:08,386
in the location from any direction? Do you have some advice or a way to read the environment or

1108
00:57:08,446 --> 00:57:11,349
to analyze it in a way that we can apply this?

1109
00:57:12,578 --> 00:57:15,461
Yeah, so the question was, if we have any advice

1110
00:57:15,501 --> 00:57:17,643
for open world games where the player might

1111
00:57:17,663 --> 00:57:20,465
be moving in any direction and coming from any direction.

1112
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:25,469
So what I was talking before about the wayfinding elements.

1113
00:57:25,749 --> 00:57:27,451
So if there is a path in the scene,

1114
00:57:27,471 --> 00:57:29,653
the player is more likely to be following that path,

1115
00:57:29,793 --> 00:57:33,276
even if it's not, even if it just is, say,

1116
00:57:33,296 --> 00:57:35,617
the vegetation being less distinct

1117
00:57:35,678 --> 00:57:36,538
in that particular area.

1118
00:57:36,558 --> 00:57:37,839
It might be an animal path.

1119
00:57:37,919 --> 00:57:40,341
So we're more likely to walk in those kind of routes.

1120
00:57:40,782 --> 00:57:42,943
So you can just walk around the space and see it.

1121
00:57:43,003 --> 00:57:45,804
And you can also, again, see play tests

1122
00:57:45,844 --> 00:57:47,525
to see where people are actually moving.

1123
00:57:48,385 --> 00:57:51,606
But yeah, it really is just about experimenting,

1124
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:52,967
taking stuff into the test bed.

1125
00:57:52,987 --> 00:57:54,427
Where does it feel natural to move?

1126
00:57:54,487 --> 00:57:56,028
How do things look when you move that way?

1127
00:57:56,268 --> 00:57:57,409
Did that answer your question?

1128
00:57:58,049 --> 00:57:58,389
Yes.

1129
00:57:58,609 --> 00:57:58,889
Thank you.

1130
00:57:58,909 --> 00:57:59,210
Thank you.

1131
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:00,110
Okay.

1132
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:02,871
Any more or are we done?

1133
00:58:03,811 --> 00:58:05,352
Well, I'll thank you all very much for coming.
