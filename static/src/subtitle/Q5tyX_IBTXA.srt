1
00:00:03,987 --> 00:00:04,967
All right, let's get started.

2
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:07,870
Hello, my name is Michael or Mikey,

3
00:00:08,511 --> 00:00:09,912
either one if you'd like.

4
00:00:10,753 --> 00:00:12,754
This is my presentation titled

5
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:15,056
Marketing Fundamentals for New Developers.

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,762
I am a marketing director for Crows Crows Crows.

7
00:00:21,842 --> 00:00:23,404
It's a new studio by William Pugh.

8
00:00:23,744 --> 00:00:26,006
You might know him from games like Stanley Parable.

9
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:30,816
We just put out our recent game called Dr. Langiskov,

10
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:32,737
the tiger in the terribly cursed emerald,

11
00:00:32,757 --> 00:00:33,858
a world with a heist.

12
00:00:35,758 --> 00:00:37,960
Before doing that, I did a whole bunch of Kickstarters.

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,761
I was doing about 10 a year.

14
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:42,742
I've been getting out of the game though,

15
00:00:42,762 --> 00:00:44,483
I'm trying to kind of distance myself

16
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:45,763
from that Kickstarter life.

17
00:00:46,484 --> 00:00:48,144
But before doing that even,

18
00:00:48,445 --> 00:00:50,886
I released Catacomb Kids on Steam.

19
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:55,242
So I've been doing the marketing director thing

20
00:00:55,282 --> 00:00:56,362
for about three or four years.

21
00:00:57,442 --> 00:00:58,743
I don't have mastery yet.

22
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:00,904
That would take a ton of years,

23
00:01:00,964 --> 00:01:02,904
probably like 10, probably a few decades,

24
00:01:03,324 --> 00:01:05,345
because just like programming art and music,

25
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:10,807
marketing is insanely complex if you look further into it.

26
00:01:14,844 --> 00:01:16,844
What I do have instead, instead of mastery,

27
00:01:16,884 --> 00:01:18,305
what I do have are fundamentals.

28
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:21,627
And that has been good enough for me to get through,

29
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:23,928
to talk on stage, to get through

30
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:25,728
everything I've been through so far.

31
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:31,459
The reason why that's possible is because the industry as a

32
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:34,620
whole for indies is a little bit farther behind than the other

33
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,941
industries. Because people have a different kind of

34
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:42,163
understanding of what marketing is, what does it do and kind of

35
00:01:42,183 --> 00:01:44,464
how it functions with their games and where does it kind of

36
00:01:44,484 --> 00:01:46,905
fit into the funding aspect of everything.

37
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:50,908
So a few questions I hear all the time from people are things

38
00:01:50,928 --> 00:01:51,949
like, I don't need marketing.

39
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:53,371
A great game will sell itself.

40
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:58,117
This is a great one because it kind of implies that there's

41
00:01:58,157 --> 00:02:01,482
this invisible line in the sand that will tell you if the

42
00:02:01,502 --> 00:02:02,343
thing will work or not.

43
00:02:02,884 --> 00:02:04,466
But that's not quite how marketing works.

44
00:02:04,706 --> 00:02:06,328
Marketing is actually a multiplier.

45
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:09,011
It doesn't work as a thing that just passes or fails.

46
00:02:09,752 --> 00:02:11,774
It kind of determines whether or not your thing

47
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:15,999
gets really big or barely makes its goal.

48
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,861
But it's kind of hard to tell without looking

49
00:02:17,962 --> 00:02:19,503
really far into the data.

50
00:02:21,565 --> 00:02:24,388
The next part about that is that that game was going to sell,

51
00:02:24,868 --> 00:02:26,990
or going to make its goal anyways.

52
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,791
How do you know it was actually marketing?

53
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:31,394
This is another thing that shows that,

54
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,515
kind of any developers have this problem

55
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:36,298
where they are assuming that the game

56
00:02:36,338 --> 00:02:37,519
is going to make its goal anyways,

57
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:40,341
and they don't know how marketing affects things.

58
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:42,283
And this is something I hear hundreds of times,

59
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:43,464
actually, every year.

60
00:02:43,484 --> 00:02:44,865
And this is a really good one.

61
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:47,567
Luck is a major factor in game sales.

62
00:02:48,408 --> 00:02:51,451
Again, kind of implying a lack of understanding about value.

63
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:54,234
And then, this is actually the best one.

64
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:55,596
I did everything right.

65
00:02:55,656 --> 00:02:56,657
I had a great game.

66
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,419
I had good reviews, good press,

67
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,861
and I went to all of the events.

68
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:05,413
If I failed it had to have been the macroeconomic state of the

69
00:03:05,513 --> 00:03:09,994
indie game industry. For sure not me. This is something that

70
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:12,415
I get all the time basically on Twitter. You probably heard

71
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:17,116
about it, the indiepocalypse you might have heard. It's kind of

72
00:03:17,156 --> 00:03:20,257
an odd thing to hear from people because it shows that they don't

73
00:03:20,297 --> 00:03:23,438
have an experience about where funding is coming from. We have

74
00:03:23,478 --> 00:03:26,999
a good gauge for when games do well because we have reviews.

75
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:31,441
we say okay this person who's an expert and a whole bunch of experts all kind of came

76
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:36,003
together and agreed that this game was very well made. But we don't really have that for

77
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:41,165
marketing. We don't really have a way to track whether or not things are working or if things

78
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:45,047
are not working. And if you don't know if things are working or not then you tend to make

79
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:48,888
mistakes all over the place, spend money incorrectly and eventually fail.

80
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:53,950
So what can we learn from getting this fundamental

81
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:59,193
understanding about the system of marketing? And you can learn

82
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:01,414
all kinds of things, actually like an insane amount of things

83
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:05,275
like should I get a booth? Will my kick start succeed? When

84
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:08,797
should I launch my game? These crazy systems you think that

85
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:12,358
wouldn't be related but actually are like tied close knit.

86
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,581
That brings me to what is called a conversion system. A

87
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:22,445
conversion system is just kind of a mindset that you have to be

88
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:25,587
in to understand how everything fits together. And if you think

89
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:29,449
along what a conversion system is, then you'll be able to kind

90
00:04:29,489 --> 00:04:32,291
of map out if what you're doing is going to be successful or

91
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:35,513
not. If your tinder profile is doing better than you thought it

92
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:39,376
was, whatever you want to do, it will pretty much kind of solve

93
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,777
it if you can actually get the metrics to be correct.

94
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:44,780
So the first part of it is cost.

95
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,821
Cost, it could be anything.

96
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:48,623
It could be labor, it could be time, it could be money,

97
00:04:48,963 --> 00:04:51,465
it could be your community, or it could even be your morale.

98
00:04:52,206 --> 00:04:53,387
A lot of people get burnt out

99
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:54,988
if they do too much of something.

100
00:04:55,869 --> 00:04:58,571
So a lot of time I'll see indies go from booth to booth

101
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:00,812
to booth to booth to booth all across the world,

102
00:05:00,853 --> 00:05:04,856
going across to Australia and to the Netherlands,

103
00:05:04,876 --> 00:05:06,897
to everywhere, and they get burned out.

104
00:05:06,977 --> 00:05:09,760
And eventually you figure out that the morality

105
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,380
that they had

106
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:15,644
morale that they had has expired and they will not be effective

107
00:05:15,664 --> 00:05:19,926
workers later. The next part is views. Views can come in all

108
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:23,028
different kinds of forms. The most common ones are curated

109
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:25,930
views. Those are things you know of like press. Then there's

110
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,733
other things like adverts which is views that you pay for. And

111
00:05:29,753 --> 00:05:32,634
then there's finally community. Community is caused by your

112
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:35,316
community while talking about your game or sharing it with

113
00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:38,218
other people. This is actually the hardest one to get and it's

114
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:39,459
also the most expensive one.

115
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,961
and it's actually the hardest one to control as well.

116
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:45,702
So if you have too much of a focus towards community,

117
00:05:45,842 --> 00:05:47,723
it tends to be a very bad idea,

118
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:50,004
unless you have some very good metrics

119
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:50,905
telling you that you should.

120
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:56,868
The next part is called engagement rate. This is just simply the number of people who have viewed the game

121
00:05:57,368 --> 00:05:59,689
that care about it in some way to get more information.

122
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,312
No matter what, a percentage of your views are always going to turn into an engagement rate.

123
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:08,294
It's kind of just the way of life is. If you give enough views to something,

124
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:12,136
there will always be some person who just loves it for some reason, even if your game is garbage.

125
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:15,694
The next part is called conversion rate, which is the

126
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:19,655
percent of the percent of engagement rate that turn into

127
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:22,656
some kind of value in the future. This value could be all

128
00:06:22,736 --> 00:06:26,557
kinds of things. It can be things like sales, it can be

129
00:06:26,617 --> 00:06:28,478
money, it can be someone buying your t-shirt, it can be someone

130
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:31,539
going to your community or going to Twitter and tweeting you,

131
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,240
retweeting your stuff all the time, sending you a little box

132
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,281
of cookies. It doesn't really matter. But some way to measure

133
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:42,043
it is really required. But this only counts if it's captured.

134
00:06:42,883 --> 00:06:46,006
So that means that if you do not do anything with it,

135
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:48,649
if you get a news article, if you get a giant press release,

136
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,012
if you don't do anything with it

137
00:06:51,032 --> 00:06:52,253
and you don't put it somewhere

138
00:06:52,353 --> 00:06:54,055
in a way that keeps people together,

139
00:06:54,536 --> 00:06:57,279
well, it's going to decay until it dies very quickly.

140
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,933
So what we're going to do is we're going to focus on mailing

141
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:04,077
lists. Mailing lists is like the best way of capturing things

142
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:07,902
because it doesn't require much at all to put it together. And

143
00:07:07,942 --> 00:07:10,205
it doesn't require you to have a product made. It doesn't require

144
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:12,828
you to know what you're doing necessarily right away.

145
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:16,225
You can even like kind of have a prototype-y,

146
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,627
not really for sure idea about the game

147
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,648
and still start one of these.

148
00:07:20,489 --> 00:07:21,970
It doesn't take much to maintain it.

149
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:25,333
You don't need to manage it with,

150
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:27,055
you don't need to manage physical production,

151
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:29,077
which would be things like creating figurines

152
00:07:29,277 --> 00:07:32,680
or shirts or little bobble heads, whatever.

153
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:36,344
And it universally provides value when you cash out on it.

154
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:38,383
So mailing lists I love.

155
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,704
I use them for pretty much everything that I ever do

156
00:07:41,104 --> 00:07:43,005
because it allows me to gauge value right away

157
00:07:43,065 --> 00:07:44,166
even when we're not selling a game.

158
00:07:44,686 --> 00:07:46,107
And that allows me to kind of map out

159
00:07:46,147 --> 00:07:47,627
if what we're doing is correct or not.

160
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,968
So this is how you kind of get started.

161
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:52,069
And this is gonna be a lot of tools that I talk about,

162
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:53,850
but these are all kind of mandatory.

163
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,491
So go ahead and take your phones out if you need to

164
00:07:56,551 --> 00:07:58,272
to take a picture of them on each slide.

165
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:00,573
But I will have the slides up later on.

166
00:08:01,633 --> 00:08:03,954
I'll go slowly so people can get that creeped out.

167
00:08:05,275 --> 00:08:07,537
The first one is how do you record cost?

168
00:08:07,577 --> 00:08:08,397
This one's going to be easy.

169
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:09,358
Get a notebook.

170
00:08:09,738 --> 00:08:14,361
Go ahead and write down what you're actually spending and try to keep track of where you're

171
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,682
putting your money and who you're putting your money with.

172
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:19,184
You can do things like have a checkbook.

173
00:08:19,664 --> 00:08:21,345
You can do other things like kind of manage

174
00:08:21,365 --> 00:08:22,345
where your time is going.

175
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:25,246
But yeah, the general idea is that you should probably

176
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:26,787
know your costs when you're very small.

177
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:28,908
Later on it gets more and more complex

178
00:08:28,948 --> 00:08:31,389
when you need to learn about where your employees are

179
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:33,110
and how the work is coming through and all that.

180
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:35,791
But for the meantime, if you're just a few employees

181
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:37,431
or a few people just trying to make a game,

182
00:08:38,212 --> 00:08:38,952
just get a notebook.

183
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:43,297
The next part is views. You're going to need twitter, facebook, youtube, analytics.

184
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,742
These ones are pretty easy. They're pretty standard. I'm sure a lot of people have

185
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:49,445
twitter analytics already enabled, I assume, right?

186
00:08:50,318 --> 00:08:53,662
Yeah? A little hands? Good we have a few. That's wonderful.

187
00:08:53,762 --> 00:08:57,025
Okay. So Twitter analytics is just a simple thing. You just

188
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:59,628
Google Twitter analytics. You just Google Facebook analytics,

189
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:02,371
YouTube analytics and it will pop up automatically. You just

190
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:04,854
sign in and then it just permanently has a little tiny

191
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:07,156
three bars next to all your tweets that tell you how many

192
00:09:07,196 --> 00:09:09,639
people touched it, how many people viewed it, how many

193
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,921
people clicked on it, all these kinds of things.

194
00:09:12,502 --> 00:09:13,623
and you kind of get obsessed with it

195
00:09:13,643 --> 00:09:15,664
and it's a little path into darkness and all that,

196
00:09:15,704 --> 00:09:16,444
but don't worry about it.

197
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:18,806
The next part is a little bit more complex.

198
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:21,268
This is called SEM Rush in Alexia.

199
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:24,309
You probably might not know these things.

200
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,731
These are just kind of metrics that gauge

201
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:29,173
how much activity is going to a website.

202
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:31,934
This comes in really handy when you're trying to figure out

203
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:33,656
whether or not that press release that you put together

204
00:09:33,696 --> 00:09:35,076
or that exclusive energy view

205
00:09:35,397 --> 00:09:36,658
was actually going to be something

206
00:09:36,678 --> 00:09:37,818
that pays off in the future.

207
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,220
because if you don't know how many views you're getting

208
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,801
from a big media place, well, you know,

209
00:09:43,281 --> 00:09:44,842
you don't really know what you got out of it.

210
00:09:44,902 --> 00:09:47,544
And this system's all about determining if what you put in

211
00:09:47,984 --> 00:09:50,366
is worth more or less than what you get out.

212
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:52,567
The next is engagement range.

213
00:09:52,587 --> 00:09:54,028
You'll just need Google Analytics,

214
00:09:54,548 --> 00:09:56,269
Google Webmaster Tools, they're different things,

215
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,490
and Clicky, I really like Clicky.

216
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,031
It's actually just a free little program.

217
00:10:00,431 --> 00:10:02,633
And I'll list all the free programs I actually use.

218
00:10:02,673 --> 00:10:05,214
I'm not gonna rope you into some kind of thing

219
00:10:05,254 --> 00:10:06,775
that's really expensive or anything like that.

220
00:10:07,575 --> 00:10:10,256
But I think clicky is a good extension to Google analytics.

221
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:12,017
And if you want to transition over,

222
00:10:12,077 --> 00:10:13,617
it's kind of a, it helps you out there.

223
00:10:14,838 --> 00:10:15,918
This is going to help you measure

224
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,319
when people land on your webpage,

225
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:20,420
which will tell you how many people who viewed the thing

226
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,380
actually went over and saw your stuff.

227
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,961
And that's really important.

228
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:26,101
And clicky is going to help you also get a little further

229
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:28,482
analytics about where those people are directly coming from,

230
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,963
whether it's through advertisement or it's Twitter

231
00:10:31,123 --> 00:10:33,084
or whatever, it gets convoluted when you start getting like

232
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:35,265
good at stuff and you bring a lot of people in.

233
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:37,725
The next part is called conversion rate.

234
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:40,506
This is going to be where we're bringing people.

235
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:44,067
This is going to be to the website and then to the mailing list.

236
00:10:44,507 --> 00:10:45,787
So how do we set up a mailing list?

237
00:10:45,807 --> 00:10:47,367
Well we have four programs here.

238
00:10:48,228 --> 00:10:52,749
We have Sandy, we have MailChimp, Aweber, and Infusionsoft.

239
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:55,629
Infusionsoft is like the ultra darkness of marketing.

240
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:59,570
It's like hundreds of dollars every month, but it provides fantastic analytics.

241
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,371
Don't worry about it that much.

242
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:05,291
Just list it so you know a path into the void, I guess.

243
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:09,234
So Sunday is probably the best for new developers because it

244
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:14,297
is very, very cheap. MailChimp is a close second. It's kind of

245
00:11:14,317 --> 00:11:17,879
in the same ballpark but a little more expensive. And then

246
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:21,501
Aweber is in the same thing as MailChimp. But just select any

247
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:25,083
one of those and get started right away and set up a web

248
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:28,025
page that just has a way to sign up to your mailing list.

249
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:30,554
And finally, the value return.

250
00:11:30,754 --> 00:11:33,878
So value return is such a tricky thing to measure

251
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:35,400
when you're looking at a mailing list,

252
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,502
because how do you know that the person that's signing up

253
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:40,246
is going to actually be someone that ends up caring

254
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,288
about what you're doing, and ends up seven months

255
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:44,331
down the line buying what you want them to,

256
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,253
or retweeting your stuff, or...

257
00:11:47,634 --> 00:11:51,295
article that you just got and leaving a comment and showing

258
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,415
support for the things that you're getting. So how do you

259
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:57,577
measure people? Right? Well, let's talk about how humans

260
00:11:57,637 --> 00:12:00,537
love each other, I guess. So there's a thing called cohort

261
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:04,179
analysis, which is a little, it sounds a little technical, but

262
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:06,539
it's really not that big of a deal. It's kind of just the

263
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,760
idea that people in big groups can be separated into smaller

264
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,582
groups. That's all it is. So if you see at the top, you'll see

265
00:12:14,622 --> 00:12:16,362
that there's a big, big, big peak.

266
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:19,704
up there to the right, left, I don't know, over there.

267
00:12:20,565 --> 00:12:23,066
And it'll be dropping down rapidly right now.

268
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:26,208
That's because that's just normal, it's very normal

269
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:27,489
that people sign up to your mail list,

270
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:29,010
they don't even care about your first email.

271
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,252
They never do, they just do it for some reason.

272
00:12:31,712 --> 00:12:32,132
I'm not sure.

273
00:12:32,492 --> 00:12:33,973
But yeah, they sign up and they just leave.

274
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:35,915
So that's what happens at the very beginning.

275
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,396
Then what will happen is that further on,

276
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,118
there'll be a progression of people

277
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:43,500
who continue to open your mails over and over again

278
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,281
until you hit this kind of weird, straight line.

279
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:49,985
That's not quite zero, but not quite a lot either.

280
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:52,187
That is your core group of people.

281
00:12:52,307 --> 00:12:55,290
These are the people who will always be with you forever.

282
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,772
They're permanently latched to you.

283
00:12:57,272 --> 00:12:59,755
And the way that we know this is back to how humans

284
00:12:59,815 --> 00:13:01,316
interact with value with each other.

285
00:13:01,756 --> 00:13:04,519
Well, if you go through a lot of hoops with somebody,

286
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:06,361
if you pass a lot of barriers,

287
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:08,383
if you're willing to go very far for something,

288
00:13:08,743 --> 00:13:11,186
then it tends to be that you value them very much.

289
00:13:12,942 --> 00:13:15,845
So you're gonna see the people at the very bottom,

290
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:18,167
if they're curving off straight.

291
00:13:18,728 --> 00:13:21,170
Now if you see that when you have people signing up,

292
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,551
it just dives into the ground,

293
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:24,773
that means everything that you've been working towards

294
00:13:24,873 --> 00:13:27,275
is kind of a failure, which is great, I guess,

295
00:13:27,315 --> 00:13:28,497
because it's a learning experience,

296
00:13:28,637 --> 00:13:31,179
but not so great for money.

297
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,262
But yeah, so if you see it diving off into a cliff,

298
00:13:34,282 --> 00:13:35,923
then you know fundamentally that you're either

299
00:13:36,244 --> 00:13:37,765
producing content that they don't care about,

300
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:41,878
or that you were given a chance and you failed them.

301
00:13:42,798 --> 00:13:43,698
I guess that's terrible.

302
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,520
But yeah, so going on to the next thing.

303
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,841
So this little area here is the people who care zone.

304
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,923
You can measure out how many people that care

305
00:13:52,943 --> 00:13:56,064
out of the thousands that are signing up.

306
00:13:56,564 --> 00:13:58,246
So this is another ratio for you.

307
00:13:58,646 --> 00:14:00,608
So you have a ratio of how many people engage

308
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:03,310
with the view count, or the thing that you're putting out.

309
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,232
Then you have a percentage of people

310
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:07,354
who convert from the engagement,

311
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:09,816
and you have a percentage of people from the conversion

312
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:11,778
who turn into people who actually care about you.

313
00:14:12,638 --> 00:14:15,701
For me myself, the people who care about me have represented

314
00:14:15,781 --> 00:14:19,323
about, they tend to convert at a rate of 40 to 70%.

315
00:14:19,724 --> 00:14:21,805
So basically that means that anyone in this range

316
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:24,788
is almost a guarantee that they're going to purchase

317
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:25,648
in the future for me.

318
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:27,530
That could be different for everyone.

319
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,172
It's probably based on things like how you engage

320
00:14:30,192 --> 00:14:33,054
with people and experience in managing a community.

321
00:14:33,514 --> 00:14:36,016
But if you see a lot of people being built up here,

322
00:14:36,357 --> 00:14:38,278
it's probably a good sign that you're doing something right.

323
00:14:39,722 --> 00:14:44,004
So this is the full conversion system. It is a cost, it is the

324
00:14:44,044 --> 00:14:46,724
views, it is the engagements, it is the conversions, and then

325
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:49,585
finally what is the output that you're receiving. And through

326
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:52,346
cohort analysis you'll be able to find out how many people

327
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:56,667
actually cared and what kind of an iffy percentage what they're

328
00:14:56,687 --> 00:15:01,748
going to do. You can call this dollar sign, vec dollar sign for

329
00:15:01,848 --> 00:15:05,650
short, if you'd like, I guess. There you go. Should you get a

330
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,010
booth?

331
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,873
So we can turn that information into actual questions that

332
00:15:10,734 --> 00:15:11,835
provide really good answers.

333
00:15:12,555 --> 00:15:14,778
So how much is this gonna cost, a booth?

334
00:15:14,858 --> 00:15:17,340
We're gonna fly out to some foreign country somewhere

335
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,701
and buy a booth, a hotel room,

336
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,783
send another developer out so he mans the booth,

337
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:22,645
and we have to get the space

338
00:15:22,765 --> 00:15:24,226
and a few electronic stuff set up,

339
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:24,967
so it's gonna cost us $10,000.

340
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:28,491
This is terrible for indies by the way.

341
00:15:29,672 --> 00:15:32,296
So how do we know how many views there's going to be

342
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:32,956
at the event?

343
00:15:33,337 --> 00:15:34,679
We kind of don't, do we?

344
00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:39,365
So what we do instead is we try to figure out

345
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:41,708
a prediction of how many views we could get.

346
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:44,611
And the way we do that is...

347
00:15:46,253 --> 00:15:49,274
The way we do that is we run a press release prior to the

348
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:52,134
event. You should pretty much never go to an event unless

349
00:15:52,154 --> 00:15:55,255
you've already put out something somewhere. Don't let your

350
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:58,296
website kill you because, hey, you got all the press to write

351
00:15:58,336 --> 00:16:00,536
about you and they went to your website and it crashed. It

352
00:16:00,616 --> 00:16:03,577
sucked. Or they viewed your video and it had some really

353
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:07,438
nasty things that you forgot to take down. So, yeah, go ahead

354
00:16:07,498 --> 00:16:10,459
and check if everything is clear, run a press release, and

355
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:12,219
that's going to give you something interesting.

356
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,421
that's going to tell you your conversion rate and that's going

357
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,943
to tell you your engagement rate and that's going to tell you

358
00:16:18,263 --> 00:16:21,686
how many people of the people who converted actually care. So

359
00:16:21,706 --> 00:16:26,289
you input in the engagement rate, the conversion rate and

360
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:30,972
how many people care at that same rate and then you try to

361
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:34,014
take the value and you do a little algebra to figure out how

362
00:16:34,074 --> 00:16:36,956
many people, how many views would you have to get in order

363
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:40,259
to make it valuable enough for you to go to the event. You

364
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:41,059
just solve for V.

365
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,393
So how many press writers would you need is a good question to

366
00:16:46,413 --> 00:16:49,613
start asking yourself to make this system complete. And how

367
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:53,094
can you be certain that those people will actually write? And

368
00:16:53,134 --> 00:16:58,355
this kind of leads me to kind of the magical thing about the

369
00:16:58,415 --> 00:17:01,815
conversion system is that it's teaching you things that you

370
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,456
wouldn't normally think about. So how could you possibly figure

371
00:17:05,476 --> 00:17:08,597
out a way to make sure that the press are going to write about

372
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:11,277
you before you even go? Well, I just talk to them.

373
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:16,962
That was my secret I guess. I just go ahead and I email hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people.

374
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:22,286
I guess. Before the event I look at who's going to attend. I message them personally.

375
00:17:22,406 --> 00:17:24,608
And a month in advance I try to sell them on the game.

376
00:17:25,188 --> 00:17:27,530
And then before the event comes I schedule an interview.

377
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:31,614
If the interviews don't combine together to equal a reasonable amount of views,

378
00:17:31,794 --> 00:17:33,615
I don't go to the event and I just cancel.

379
00:17:36,945 --> 00:17:41,050
So when should you launch your game or kick starter or any of

380
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,235
those. This is the secret of my kick starter success. I said I

381
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:49,840
did about ten a year back in the day when I was younger I guess.

382
00:17:52,386 --> 00:17:56,487
how did I end up making them all work? And that's the secret. I

383
00:17:56,907 --> 00:18:01,749
just ran a conversion system until the range outputted that I

384
00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:05,130
was going to succeed exactly on day one. So I just didn't launch

385
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:12,092
until it said to. That was the secret the whole time. And

386
00:18:12,112 --> 00:18:15,513
that's kind of it. It doesn't seem like it would be something

387
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:19,454
that would be all encompassing, but it kind of is. And that's

388
00:18:19,514 --> 00:18:20,294
kind of the problem.

389
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:24,431
is that this seems a little bit back of the napkin

390
00:18:24,531 --> 00:18:26,453
kind of mathy, right?

391
00:18:26,953 --> 00:18:29,575
That how can a conversion system tell everything

392
00:18:29,595 --> 00:18:31,937
about what is going to happen in the future?

393
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:33,418
And the answer is that it can't.

394
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:37,150
We're playing a game with imperfect information.

395
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:38,752
But that's okay.

396
00:18:38,832 --> 00:18:40,613
It's okay to not have perfect information.

397
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,915
We're gonna have views that we don't understand.

398
00:18:43,276 --> 00:18:45,658
And we're gonna have views that could be broken down

399
00:18:45,678 --> 00:18:47,399
into a thousand different categories.

400
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,602
Whether it be, oh, this person makes $30,000 a year

401
00:18:50,642 --> 00:18:52,784
and it's a Friday and he got paid on Friday.

402
00:18:52,804 --> 00:18:55,667
That's its own conversion system on a separate note.

403
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:57,669
It can be infinitely complex.

404
00:18:58,209 --> 00:19:00,531
We can figure out all the people who like basket weaving.

405
00:19:01,413 --> 00:19:06,254
Web comics and your kind of rogue like weird platform a video game with pixel art

406
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,401
And then we can put them all together

407
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:11,982
and then figure out what that more accurate look

408
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:13,883
into what the actual output would be.

409
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:16,424
But that takes a lot of time,

410
00:19:16,664 --> 00:19:18,825
and that takes a lot of energy to actually understand.

411
00:19:19,405 --> 00:19:22,786
You wouldn't really know by doing it just your first time

412
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:24,847
or listening to a few devlogs

413
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:27,848
about whether or not what you're doing is actually correct

414
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:29,869
or whether or not the system that you're doing

415
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:32,470
is actually providing a false positive

416
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,811
or is it actually giving you the results that you need.

417
00:19:35,351 --> 00:19:36,752
You're not going to figure that out right away.

418
00:19:37,112 --> 00:19:39,853
But what it does provide, even if from the day one,

419
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:43,415
is a mental map that can help lead you to solve problems,

420
00:19:43,835 --> 00:19:46,216
or at least leads you in the right mindset to solve problems

421
00:19:46,536 --> 00:19:47,516
that you wouldn't otherwise.

422
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,398
Kind of like saying how we know that for a fact,

423
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:53,699
if we don't get a bunch of writers to write about us

424
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:56,200
before we even go to sign up with the interviews,

425
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,221
it's probably not worth the risk.

426
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:00,062
And we can tell that even if the data

427
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,283
that we're putting into the system is inaccurate.

428
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,387
that if we don't have a way to solve this system,

429
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:08,010
or we don't have a way to have the system be reasonable,

430
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,473
then we know, at least through our experience

431
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:13,717
or what we perceive as reasonable, that it's wrong,

432
00:20:13,857 --> 00:20:15,780
and we have to steer away from that.

433
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,182
So, when your experiences are combined with larger

434
00:20:19,222 --> 00:20:22,143
view sample sizes and more accurate polling methods,

435
00:20:22,524 --> 00:20:24,705
the conversion system isn't the problem.

436
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:28,147
The problem is that you're not having the right experience

437
00:20:28,187 --> 00:20:30,468
and you're not having the right data to go into it.

438
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:32,510
Of course, it's a bottomless black hole,

439
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,332
but that's all right, we don't necessarily need that.

440
00:20:36,412 --> 00:20:37,833
The closer we can get to a range

441
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:38,873
that's reasonable, the better.

442
00:20:39,414 --> 00:20:42,295
So this is kind of probably an odd talk I guess.

443
00:20:42,355 --> 00:20:44,336
It's because I'm not really talking about

444
00:20:44,396 --> 00:20:46,878
how to do very basic marketing stuff.

445
00:20:46,978 --> 00:20:49,759
But at its core, every decision that I've ever made

446
00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:52,301
up to this point, and all the way through my journey

447
00:20:52,321 --> 00:20:53,662
of becoming a marketing director,

448
00:20:54,062 --> 00:20:55,303
and working with all these people,

449
00:20:55,663 --> 00:20:58,504
and raising millions of dollars on Kickstarter,

450
00:20:58,784 --> 00:21:00,706
is all at its core based on this system.

451
00:21:01,306 --> 00:21:04,248
And so it's imperfect and it's messy,

452
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:06,309
but I've only had three to four years.

453
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:07,669
And that's all right.

454
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:11,978
So congratulations, you learned how to become me, I guess.

455
00:21:12,398 --> 00:21:14,500
And here's my Twitter, and you can add me on Skype

456
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,222
if you would like to ever tell me about your data

457
00:21:17,302 --> 00:21:18,342
or have me look at anything.

458
00:21:18,883 --> 00:21:20,724
I will go ahead and chat with you about whatever.

459
00:21:20,744 --> 00:21:21,284
Don't share that though.

460
00:21:21,304 --> 00:21:21,485
Thank you.

461
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:22,125
Thank you.

462
00:21:22,145 --> 00:21:22,345
Thank you.

463
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:22,545
Thank you.

464
00:21:22,565 --> 00:21:22,805
Thank you.

465
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:23,366
Thank you.

466
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:23,686
Thank you.

467
00:21:23,706 --> 00:21:24,226
Thank you.

468
00:21:24,266 --> 00:21:31,011
Thank you.

469
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:31,211
Thank you.

470
00:21:31,231 --> 00:21:31,411
Thank you.

471
00:21:31,431 --> 00:21:31,611
Thank you.

472
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:31,931
Thank you.

473
00:21:31,951 --> 00:21:32,132
Thank you.

474
00:21:32,152 --> 00:21:32,332
Thank you.

475
00:21:32,352 --> 00:21:32,532
Thank you.

476
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:32,772
Thank you.

477
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:33,032
Thank you.

478
00:21:34,311 --> 00:21:37,514
When do you plan to release the slides?

479
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:41,518
When do I plan to release the slides? As soon as possible actually.

480
00:21:42,158 --> 00:21:43,219
Whenever they will allow me.

481
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:44,360
Yes?

482
00:21:45,121 --> 00:21:48,464
So you mentioned that using mailing list is one of the tools.

483
00:21:48,624 --> 00:21:48,784
Yes.

484
00:21:48,884 --> 00:21:54,590
Do you have any suggestions or tips on how to get people to sign on to the mailing list?

485
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,151
How to sign on to the mailing list?

486
00:21:56,952 --> 00:21:57,893
There's a few different things.

487
00:21:59,474 --> 00:22:00,855
So it depends on what you're going for.

488
00:22:01,295 --> 00:22:03,996
So for the game that we put out, Dr. Langiskov,

489
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,498
we actually kind of obfuscated the whole email list

490
00:22:07,518 --> 00:22:09,439
signing up thing because our goal was to make it

491
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:11,560
as tough as possible for people that weren't

492
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,680
that interested to sign on.

493
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,761
So the only way you would know about the mailing list

494
00:22:14,841 --> 00:22:16,782
is actually if you downloaded the game already

495
00:22:16,862 --> 00:22:18,083
and beat it all the way through.

496
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:19,803
And at the very end it would output,

497
00:22:19,843 --> 00:22:21,004
hey, this is our mailing list.

498
00:22:21,484 --> 00:22:25,186
So we were trying to put as many filters in place as possible

499
00:22:25,226 --> 00:22:27,087
to try to get the most optimal people.

500
00:22:27,367 --> 00:22:29,808
So if you're looking for quantity, just to sign up,

501
00:22:30,168 --> 00:22:31,568
I don't think you should go after it.

502
00:22:31,989 --> 00:22:34,410
Because the cohort analysis will show that when you go

503
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,751
for a mass market, it won't actually output something

504
00:22:36,771 --> 00:22:37,271
that you want.

505
00:22:37,831 --> 00:22:40,032
But in terms of just naturally growing your views,

506
00:22:40,172 --> 00:22:42,093
I suggest putting together things like press releases

507
00:22:42,473 --> 00:22:44,594
or trailers to try to get the word out about your game.

508
00:22:45,755 --> 00:22:46,015
Thank you.

509
00:22:47,352 --> 00:22:50,513
Do you have any general tips for building a good press release

510
00:22:50,853 --> 00:22:54,135
and for building that list, do you just try to troll for and

511
00:22:54,195 --> 00:22:59,017
collect as many different direct e-mails to press writers and all

512
00:22:59,057 --> 00:23:01,999
that as you can and just e-mail them directly? Yeah, I e-mail

513
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:04,740
everyone directly. I actually just say, like, hi, I'm Mikey. I

514
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,542
don't really do a huge release thing. I just say hello and I

515
00:23:07,562 --> 00:23:10,483
tend to DM them on Twitter. I know that sounds really kind of

516
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:13,965
hacky and weird, but people tend to like personal things. So

517
00:23:13,985 --> 00:23:16,306
what do you use in the content of the actual press release

518
00:23:16,366 --> 00:23:16,726
itself?

519
00:23:17,784 --> 00:23:20,426
I tend to just tell them like, hey, here's this gif thing, do

520
00:23:20,446 --> 00:23:22,327
you think you're interested? Or I'll just say, hey, this is the

521
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:25,568
concept of the game. And over time I form actual personal

522
00:23:25,608 --> 00:23:27,970
relationships with people. I tend to message them way before

523
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,151
I even have stuff to show them. So I'll be talking to someone

524
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:34,153
and I'll research every single writer on every single website

525
00:23:34,193 --> 00:23:35,854
that's in the top 100 or 200 of all sites.

526
00:23:37,535 --> 00:23:39,617
and then I'll message each one of them personally

527
00:23:39,857 --> 00:23:41,438
and then try to form a personal relationship with them

528
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,200
so I understand what games they want specifically.

529
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,361
And then if I find out,

530
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:46,262
hey, this person likes roguelikes and we're making one,

531
00:23:46,582 --> 00:23:48,424
I send them a GIF, I tell them the pitch.

532
00:23:49,065 --> 00:23:52,568
So it's like a much larger kind of convoluted system

533
00:23:52,608 --> 00:23:54,649
than just like, hey, we have the game, here you go.

534
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:55,170
Gotcha.

535
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:02,012
Hi. Thank you for the talk. That was very informative. So when

536
00:24:02,032 --> 00:24:04,733
you were talking about the cohort analysis, you had this

537
00:24:04,813 --> 00:24:11,556
graph showing a decline of supporting users, I guess. I was

538
00:24:11,596 --> 00:24:16,137
wondering what kind of tools you used to collect this data.

539
00:24:16,518 --> 00:24:17,938
Oh, to collect information like this?

540
00:24:18,078 --> 00:24:21,580
Yeah. Because in the previous two slides you showed some tools

541
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,101
about collecting the engagement and the what?

542
00:24:27,311 --> 00:24:32,918
it's not. I was hitting the button. So yeah, on the mailing

543
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:35,961
site conversion ones, they're going to show you all that data

544
00:24:36,182 --> 00:24:39,346
and graph it out for you a lot of the time. So like sendy and

545
00:24:39,626 --> 00:24:41,889
they're going to output all the data for you.

546
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:47,755
because on the graph it shows how many users open the email?

547
00:24:47,795 --> 00:24:48,835
They can actually detect that?

548
00:24:48,996 --> 00:24:51,918
Yes they can. Oh wow, they can detect so much more.

549
00:24:52,118 --> 00:24:52,318
Okay.

550
00:24:52,338 --> 00:24:55,040
So this is, I didn't want to put this on the slide because it's kind of weird,

551
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,641
but there's a thing called mouse flow.

552
00:24:57,101 --> 00:24:57,421
Okay.

553
00:24:57,722 --> 00:25:01,805
And that will even let you see everything that they click on and move and input on the email.

554
00:25:02,225 --> 00:25:03,366
It's called mouse flow.

555
00:25:03,646 --> 00:25:05,068
Yeah, mouse flow.

556
00:25:05,208 --> 00:25:10,793
So basically if you want to go crazy and find out everything people are clicking on or everything people are moving around on,

557
00:25:11,113 --> 00:25:12,535
there's programs for even that.

558
00:25:12,635 --> 00:25:16,718
So yes, we can figure out who opened the email, we can figure out how long it took them to click the links,

559
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:21,363
how much of the email they read, everything, pretty much, from these systems.

560
00:25:21,743 --> 00:25:24,506
And Fusionsoft is going to be like the most crazy, like...

561
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:28,048
you didn't even know existed kind of thing. And sendy is

562
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,570
going to be providing similar details. So you can do all this

563
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,233
with sendy. I do it with sendy with a lot of people who don't

564
00:25:34,253 --> 00:25:36,534
have very large budgets. Yes. Thank you.

565
00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:42,571
could you go over the timing of when to release your kick start

566
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:48,175
again. That was a little bit of part of it. The way the kick

567
00:25:48,195 --> 00:25:51,157
starter would work is it's the exact same system. You put in

568
00:25:51,197 --> 00:25:54,259
how much money you would have at the start and figure out how

569
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:57,181
many views you would have to accomplish. Kind of like you

570
00:25:57,221 --> 00:25:58,722
were planning to go to GDC or whatever.

571
00:26:00,483 --> 00:26:02,844
you try to figure out how much views you would have to acquire

572
00:26:02,884 --> 00:26:06,825
before you launch. You can also figure out how many users you

573
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,486
can acquire through the mailing list. Those count as like those

574
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,687
converted at a rate that's very high. So you add those to the

575
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:14,968
amount that you need from the press. And you can find out how

576
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:17,669
many people are reading each press thing at what time based

577
00:26:17,729 --> 00:26:20,610
on things like Alexia and all the other things. So you can

578
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,791
say, oh, Kotaku, they're great at 2 p.m. And then you try to

579
00:26:23,811 --> 00:26:26,052
get an article at that time. And if you do, then you subtract

580
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:27,733
that amount and you kind of wing it-ish.

581
00:26:28,493 --> 00:26:30,813
but the point is that when I do Kickstarter,

582
00:26:31,054 --> 00:26:32,554
I'm coming out kind of swinging.

583
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:35,555
On day one, I'm getting 30K, 50K,

584
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,775
and people say, oh, it's Hyper Life Drifter 2,

585
00:26:38,095 --> 00:26:39,496
and it's like, nah, it's not.

586
00:26:39,916 --> 00:26:42,296
But what I do from there is,

587
00:26:42,516 --> 00:26:44,677
I'm going to actually just go through

588
00:26:44,697 --> 00:26:46,437
the whole thing a little bit, if you don't mind.

589
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:48,758
I'll actually kind of explain it for you, yeah,

590
00:26:49,378 --> 00:26:51,779
is that I give those views, I get the views,

591
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:52,639
I get everyone signed up,

592
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,339
and even if it doesn't hit the mark right away,

593
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:55,159
I still have 29 days now.

594
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:00,304
I then plan for other major press releases with things like trailers.

595
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:05,350
And anyone who supported me that actually I enjoy a lot, who provide a lot of views,

596
00:27:05,831 --> 00:27:07,773
I go ahead and I bomb them with a mailing list.

597
00:27:07,813 --> 00:27:09,935
I take the whole entire mailing list and I send them over.

598
00:27:10,356 --> 00:27:11,177
I say, hey, this is...

599
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:15,579
we'll do an exclusive interview with pc gamer and I'll say to

600
00:27:15,639 --> 00:27:18,320
all the fans on the mailing list that we've all signed up already

601
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,042
I'll say hey we're doing a pc gamer interview you should check

602
00:27:21,082 --> 00:27:24,703
it out. And then all these users come over to pc gamer they

603
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:27,044
really like that there's like a thousand comments two thousand

604
00:27:27,084 --> 00:27:29,285
comments they love that there's a lot of engagement people are

605
00:27:29,305 --> 00:27:32,367
sharing it and they go yeah we'll do the next trailer too.

606
00:27:33,007 --> 00:27:36,008
And then that kind of like snowballs things for us. Yeah.

607
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:38,469
Wonderful. Thank you so much.

608
00:27:41,463 --> 00:27:45,347
really great talk by the way. So I was wondering when you're

609
00:27:45,387 --> 00:27:47,709
first starting out with your mailing list like you have zero

610
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:51,553
users, where do you go first? Do you start sending stuff first to

611
00:27:51,613 --> 00:27:54,476
press or are you trying to go for more like social media in

612
00:27:54,516 --> 00:27:57,259
terms of like Reddit or Facebook or Twitter, trying to get those

613
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:57,579
kind of...

614
00:27:58,681 --> 00:28:03,746
marketing type of deal. So reddit and twitter and facebook

615
00:28:03,826 --> 00:28:06,909
they tend to be very bad for engagement because you are

616
00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:10,092
talking within a circle and the tweets expire very quickly so it

617
00:28:10,132 --> 00:28:13,256
takes a huge amount of output in order to get a good input back.

618
00:28:14,216 --> 00:28:16,518
basically twitter and Facebook and all those tend not to work

619
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:19,980
very well until you already have a part of a following. So I

620
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:23,863
would suggest that you can do twitter if you want to do it for

621
00:28:23,943 --> 00:28:26,944
fun a little bit here and there. But don't take it like so

622
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:30,086
seriously that you're devoting hours to it. That's one. And I

623
00:28:30,107 --> 00:28:33,168
would also focus on things like mailing. If you know how to do

624
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:35,950
adverts which are kind of like a little bit sketchy for a lot of

625
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,652
people I suggest nobody does adverts right away until they

626
00:28:38,672 --> 00:28:39,693
like get this stuff down.

627
00:28:40,433 --> 00:28:45,615
But adverts would be the next solution up and then the one of course the best one is just get press interested

628
00:28:45,995 --> 00:28:47,456
Which is foreign personal relationships?

629
00:28:47,496 --> 00:28:52,238
I'm sure you'll find one of the 2,000 websites some are in Spanish some are in French

630
00:28:52,638 --> 00:28:55,920
You're gonna have to talk to all of them and all the writers individually and figure out how they are

631
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,441
But that's kind of what you have to do. This is like a huge part of it. I think

632
00:29:01,122 --> 00:29:08,324
The reason why it's under like understated so much is because there is this thing where people are not funding it as much like they'll

633
00:29:08,364 --> 00:29:14,526
Devote maybe two or three percent to the marketing budget as a thing and the rest will just go on to production like art music

634
00:29:14,566 --> 00:29:18,107
Whatever, but in reality all the other places that are doing indie stuff

635
00:29:18,127 --> 00:29:23,769
They tend to value like 50% 80% of the total budget, which is massively higher, right?

636
00:29:24,489 --> 00:29:27,910
So in these have this weird thing where they're not really like devoting enough resources to it

637
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,691
Whether that be their time to talk to all the press

638
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:33,813
things like that but it's not avoidable. It's literally a

639
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:38,555
straight multiplier. Do you want your multiplier to be zero or

640
00:29:38,856 --> 00:29:43,858
20? And 5 times 5 is 25 and 5 times 1 is 5. So it's always

641
00:29:43,898 --> 00:29:47,040
better to devote at least a reasonable amount to doing stuff

642
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:53,443
like that. Thank you. Any other questions? Wonderful. Thank you

643
00:29:53,483 --> 00:29:55,525
all for visiting. I hope you had a good time.
