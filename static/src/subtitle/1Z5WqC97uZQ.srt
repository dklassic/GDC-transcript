1
00:00:03,592 --> 00:00:06,314
Thank you, thank you, thank you all.

2
00:00:06,694 --> 00:00:13,339
So, hi, my name is Jonas Turner and I am a sound designer and voice actor.

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:22,086
Today I'm going to be telling you my personal insights on how to make a game feel better with sounds,

4
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,407
or how you can enhance a game feel with sounds.

5
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:31,828
This is like a 20-hour massive talk compressed into 20 minutes.

6
00:00:32,068 --> 00:00:33,429
So let's do this.

7
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,211
So my name's Janus Turner.

8
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:36,793
I work at E-Studio.

9
00:00:37,474 --> 00:00:40,416
That's a sound studio back in Helsinki, Finland.

10
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:44,961
E-Studio has its roots in music production.

11
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,584
That is recording, mixing.

12
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,885
mastering, producing music and so on and so on.

13
00:00:52,606 --> 00:00:57,669
And I was hired over there a few years back in 2012 to bring my video game sound design

14
00:00:57,689 --> 00:00:58,270
stuff over there.

15
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,110
So woohoo!

16
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:00,291
I have my own room.

17
00:01:01,132 --> 00:01:03,073
It's just like home with parents, I have my own room.

18
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:08,237
So here are some of the games I worked on.

19
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:11,860
I did sound design and voice acting for Nuclear Throne.

20
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:14,682
I did sound design for Badland.

21
00:01:14,702 --> 00:01:17,304
I did mainly voice acting for Broforce.

22
00:01:19,448 --> 00:01:22,752
I did some sound content too, like alien sound effects and stuff.

23
00:01:23,372 --> 00:01:27,876
We had a small team in Environmental Station Alpha, and I was the lead sound designer on that.

24
00:01:28,497 --> 00:01:33,061
We had a slightly bigger team on Angry Birds Transformers, I did the lead sound design on that too.

25
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:38,446
Sound design on Downwell, some additional sound content for TurboDisk Mount, and...

26
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:41,890
...reverb programming, and...

27
00:01:43,026 --> 00:01:49,628
final mixed stage stuff for the swapper and the list goes on and on and on. If you want to know more, get me a beer and we'll talk.

28
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:54,209
Wow, we are recording this. So, you can still get me a beer though.

29
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,351
And I design games as a hobby, I've been doing that for quite some while.

30
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:02,432
Cool, enough about me, let's go on into the subject.

31
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:07,894
So, first off, things to think at the design phase.

32
00:02:10,208 --> 00:02:12,671
First off, what's the game like? That's a basic question.

33
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:14,853
And what's the main focus of the player?

34
00:02:15,353 --> 00:02:18,616
So, be sure to choose the focus.

35
00:02:18,796 --> 00:02:22,779
So let's say if it's like a shooting game, you have to...

36
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:27,483
like battling, shooting, dodging, ducking for cover and stuff.

37
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:32,288
Keep that in mind and try to make the best out of it.

38
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:34,930
You can think about ambiences and stuff, but...

39
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:39,875
Put your main focus on what's the player doing, what's the core thing of the game.

40
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:42,897
Think about that. If it's like a football game, kicking the ball.

41
00:02:43,798 --> 00:02:48,681
Start to think of things how to make that feel nice and like, just juice that.

42
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:55,486
Or car game, you're driving and steering the car or whatever, tired of screeching.

43
00:02:55,586 --> 00:02:57,327
Put your thought into stuff like that.

44
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:02,838
Take a piece of paper, put like, okay, this is a card game.

45
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:04,821
Shuffling cards must feel good.

46
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:07,083
Stuff like that. Just basic. Start with that.

47
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:08,845
When you have that in your mindset,

48
00:03:09,205 --> 00:03:10,867
you will already be like, hmm.

49
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,110
So, to make the game feel better,

50
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,471
I need to juice this stuff.

51
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:17,234
And it's in your subconscious already.

52
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:18,696
So when you start creating sounds, you're like,

53
00:03:18,756 --> 00:03:19,777
is this good enough? Hmm.

54
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,541
So keep that in mind.

55
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:25,363
Think about cues to make people listen to the game,

56
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:28,625
or listen to the UI, and not to look at UI.

57
00:03:28,665 --> 00:03:29,786
Like an action game.

58
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:31,527
Sorry, UI artists, by the way.

59
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:34,349
But think about an action game.

60
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:35,369
There's shooting happening.

61
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,170
Monsters coming from there.

62
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,052
Alien, oh no, underground worm attacking you.

63
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:42,854
You don't want the player to be looking at UI.

64
00:03:42,894 --> 00:03:45,615
You're like, no, no, I have to be in the middle of the battle.

65
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:49,438
Then you're like, how many bullets have I got?

66
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:53,263
You don't want to do that in an action game, you don't want to give players like...

67
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:57,366
You want to give the players like action, not reading a book.

68
00:03:57,526 --> 00:04:01,328
So think of like audio cues to make that happen.

69
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:03,249
Like let's say you're shooting, you're out of bullets,

70
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:04,410
you could have the player shout like,

71
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,574
oh, I'm out of bullets, or make like clang of metal like,

72
00:04:09,634 --> 00:04:12,636
and you know, okay, I'm out of ammo, or about to be out of ammo.

73
00:04:13,016 --> 00:04:14,517
So keep that in mind instead of like...

74
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:19,666
Come on, that's not action.

75
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:20,987
So think of stuff like that.

76
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:25,830
When people base actions on sounds, you know that's a good thing.

77
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:29,052
Think about music.

78
00:04:29,112 --> 00:04:31,474
Sound effects and voiceovers blending together,

79
00:04:31,774 --> 00:04:33,375
like potential frequency clashes.

80
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:37,337
If you have music going, boom, boom, crazy bass, horns,

81
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:40,559
like all the time, the sound effects are like, boom, boom,

82
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,841
and then the voiceover is like a mutant going, blah, blah, blah.

83
00:04:43,173 --> 00:04:49,242
Like, all that together will make the game feel muddy, you're going to have crazy busyness happening on,

84
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:55,150
loss of focus, sometimes that's a desired effect, but throughout the game that's probably not what you want.

85
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:56,632
So, think about like...

86
00:04:58,095 --> 00:04:59,116
Think about like, um...

87
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:03,115
Bringing the designer and composer together to work on the project.

88
00:05:03,155 --> 00:05:04,936
Like, okay, composer, what do you want to do?

89
00:05:05,216 --> 00:05:07,157
Oh, you want to do that? I want to do this.

90
00:05:07,317 --> 00:05:08,958
How do we make these two work together?

91
00:05:09,378 --> 00:05:13,560
So get your composer and sound designer together in the same room or Skype or something.

92
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,581
That's already going to make it way better.

93
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:20,763
You could have dynamic systems. I'm going to talk about those later.

94
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:23,064
Just make sure the feel of the game is number one.

95
00:05:23,164 --> 00:05:28,146
And for you musicians, if you want to, like, release an official soundtrack

96
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:29,807
this is the best sounding thing I've ever done.

97
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:32,789
It doesn't need to be that in the game.

98
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:36,592
A soundtrack itself can be a separate entity for what's in the game.

99
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:39,635
Just make sure what's in the game complements everything.

100
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:43,439
And create something unique.

101
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:49,124
What I mean by this is make something that people think this game is unique.

102
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,045
that game. For instance, a language, creating a language for a game might be a good way

103
00:05:55,065 --> 00:06:01,690
to do this. As an example, for Nuclear Throne, I wrote this language, created this language

104
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:07,794
called Trastalk that the mutants talk, and the enemies have a different dialect of that.

105
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,115
So that already gives like

106
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:13,953
world building. It already makes the world feel like a living world in a sense.

107
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:17,874
And what I have in the game is when the players enter a world it's like

108
00:06:19,535 --> 00:06:25,336
stuff like that. So I have that happening. So that already feels I know I'm going to a new level,

109
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:30,918
new world, like when the monster shouts that. And the cool thing is sometimes you see players,

110
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:35,419
like I've seen players play another game and they go to a new level and they're like

111
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:36,640
flash and I'm like

112
00:06:37,809 --> 00:06:40,810
that already gave them a nice memo of the game.

113
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,411
You could do success sounds like, doo-doo-doo-doo, you made it, like doo-doo-doo-doo, hey.

114
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:47,291
Stuff like that.

115
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:50,852
Just something that makes the game feel like the game it is.

116
00:06:51,272 --> 00:06:52,672
Make the game feel unique.

117
00:06:54,412 --> 00:07:00,333
One thing I would say try to avoid is you have this game doing the inception thing,

118
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,454
that game doing the inception thing, that too.

119
00:07:02,874 --> 00:07:04,774
Wow, you all made the inception.

120
00:07:04,814 --> 00:07:05,194
Good job.

121
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:06,855
So try to be...

122
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:08,363
a bit original.

123
00:07:08,383 --> 00:07:11,406
That will already make the game feel like your game.

124
00:07:13,327 --> 00:07:15,609
I have to go really fast through all this.

125
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,231
So let's jump into creation.

126
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:21,433
Plan on gear slash chain.

127
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:28,559
What I mean by this is, usually when I start a project, I decide what microphone and what

128
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:29,119
preamp.

129
00:07:30,087 --> 00:07:32,367
I will use for all the action sounds.

130
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:35,349
So like jumping, opening doors, explosions, stuff like that.

131
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:41,551
I would always use the same pair, like same mic and same preamp for all of these sounds.

132
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,232
Like I would be really strict about it.

133
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:48,413
And let's say for voiceovers, I would use that microphone and that preamp.

134
00:07:48,673 --> 00:07:51,655
And for the enemy voiceovers, I would use that microphone and that preamp.

135
00:07:52,095 --> 00:07:52,655
Stuff like that.

136
00:07:53,615 --> 00:07:55,016
And what this does is...

137
00:07:56,105 --> 00:08:00,088
It kind of makes these sounds be in the same sonic space.

138
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,830
Like, they are already, like, all the action sounds will feel the same

139
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,311
because they are recorded with the same stuff.

140
00:08:05,272 --> 00:08:07,754
All the voiceovers will feel the same because they are, you know, you know.

141
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:12,218
And that just makes the world feel more believable.

142
00:08:12,298 --> 00:08:15,000
It's the same ears listening.

143
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,481
Like, it makes sense, right?

144
00:08:17,482 --> 00:08:21,946
And what I mean with chain is, you know you have, like, Pro Tools,

145
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:24,047
Nuendo, Cubase, Ableton, like, whatever.

146
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:25,428
You have a software.

147
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:26,846
You have all the layers here.

148
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:30,370
OK, I have that for clothes, that for metal, clanking, whatever.

149
00:08:30,731 --> 00:08:32,493
And all these make one sound.

150
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,115
And they go through the master chain.

151
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:37,519
So what I would do if this master chain is,

152
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,803
I would always have the same dynamics processing,

153
00:08:40,843 --> 00:08:41,684
like same limiter.

154
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,288
a saturator, if I want to use that in the game, like give some distortion feel to the game,

155
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:50,712
I would always have the exact same effects processing in the master chain

156
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:53,654
for every sound I make for the game.

157
00:08:53,674 --> 00:08:59,079
Because that makes everything, like these have their own, like, the action vocals and stuff,

158
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:02,802
they have their own, like, sonic spaces here, like they have different gear,

159
00:09:02,862 --> 00:09:04,463
they are already different from each other.

160
00:09:05,404 --> 00:09:08,246
Then I have the master chain that ties all these.

161
00:09:10,152 --> 00:09:15,617
They feel different, but they still feel the same because they all go through the same filter, so to say.

162
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,861
And it just ties them together, it glues them together.

163
00:09:20,982 --> 00:09:21,943
Just keep that in mind.

164
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:24,125
Oh, whoa, I jumped a point.

165
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:27,648
So one point about using the same mic and preamplifier stuff is,

166
00:09:28,209 --> 00:09:31,952
for actions and vocals and stuff, it will make them pop out from the mix

167
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:33,774
without doing crazy tricks.

168
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,615
So I would have like...

169
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:42,665
battlefield scene happening and then the voiceovers are done with another setup.

170
00:09:43,326 --> 00:09:46,568
That will make already the vocals pop out a bit more.

171
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,309
And enemies have a different setup.

172
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,671
You make them pop out from the player setup.

173
00:09:51,272 --> 00:09:54,154
Just think of how the pairs stuff sonically.

174
00:09:54,834 --> 00:09:56,455
And I don't mean the Sega game.

175
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:58,397
And that also makes a good drinking game.

176
00:09:58,437 --> 00:10:00,619
Like, every time I say Sonic, I have a drink.

177
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:01,980
I know, I will.

178
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,201
So, so, so.

179
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:13,922
Now let's do some tips. Make your sounds shorter. So, with this I mean, well I actually play

180
00:10:13,962 --> 00:10:22,930
a jump sound that I made. So you can hear that's a jump sound. And it takes that long

181
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:28,114
to complete. So the thing is, you have like long sounds like that, it will, it will make

182
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,933
In time, it will become repetitive.

183
00:10:32,053 --> 00:10:36,156
It will give you gradual fatigue of always pressing a button and waiting for it to end.

184
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,560
It will become really annoying at some point.

185
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,600
You don't want to jump anymore.

186
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,722
You're like, it's taking so long, I don't want to do that.

187
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:47,663
Think about opening doors.

188
00:10:51,043 --> 00:10:53,004
After the third door you're going to say, fuck doors,

189
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:54,325
I'm going to blast my way through.

190
00:10:54,805 --> 00:10:56,026
So, oh, sorry.

191
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:57,747
I said the nice word.

192
00:10:59,628 --> 00:11:03,370
So make some shorter to resist that.

193
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,872
Like, normal jump, shorter jump.

194
00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:13,835
It already feels more like, I could listen to this way more

195
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:15,256
than to that, like in a game.

196
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:19,279
It just makes the sound feel more...

197
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:21,040
What would be the right word?

198
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,240
Like, I mean, no...

199
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,181
It just makes the sound feel nicer.

200
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,621
The game feel nicer.

201
00:11:25,641 --> 00:11:27,782
Then, um...

202
00:11:29,082 --> 00:11:31,563
Make the beginnings shorter of your sounds.

203
00:11:32,103 --> 00:11:33,784
Think about the player pushing a button.

204
00:11:33,804 --> 00:11:35,184
What I mean by this is...

205
00:11:36,185 --> 00:11:36,605
When you...

206
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:38,105
Like this sound.

207
00:11:39,246 --> 00:11:41,186
There's a small gradual build to it.

208
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:42,707
You jump.

209
00:11:43,187 --> 00:11:43,807
If it's shorter...

210
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:49,751
It's instantaneous for the button press.

211
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:52,553
And why this is important is

212
00:11:54,103 --> 00:11:58,366
You want the player to press the button, I mean usually you want the player to press a button

213
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:03,809
and be like, hey, I did that. I pressed the button, I jumped in the game. Instead of I pressed the

214
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:09,172
button and that creature jumped in the game or like whatever it is. Like you want it to be me,

215
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:16,996
extension of player, not like not you controlling another character. So like now I press jump,

216
00:12:17,076 --> 00:12:20,558
it's you jumping. Now it's me jumping.

217
00:12:22,397 --> 00:12:27,261
I don't know if you can hear it from this, but that will make the player feel like I

218
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:27,601
did it.

219
00:12:28,101 --> 00:12:30,183
It will give them a feel of satisfaction.

220
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,985
It's instant response to their action.

221
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,527
And that's always a good thing.

222
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:39,311
But then again, having a delay might make things feel sluggish.

223
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:45,736
A good example of this is the Dark Souls games, for instance.

224
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:47,257
Woohoo, shout out for them.

225
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:53,491
like if you're over encumbered, you're equipping a goddamn house on you.

226
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:54,452
I'm so heavy.

227
00:12:55,012 --> 00:12:56,854
And then you try to jump.

228
00:12:56,894 --> 00:13:00,676
It's like, that already feels like, oh, it's so,

229
00:13:02,097 --> 00:13:03,518
it's the most heaviest thing ever.

230
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,483
Instead of being, like, that doesn't feel heavy.

231
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,965
That just feels like you have crazy diarrhea or something.

232
00:13:12,445 --> 00:13:12,965
So having like.

233
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:15,945
It's like, oh, that's heavy.

234
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:19,006
You're wearing a house with horns or something.

235
00:13:19,406 --> 00:13:20,627
So think about that.

236
00:13:22,248 --> 00:13:23,308
Ooh, checking my notes.

237
00:13:23,848 --> 00:13:24,869
Cool.

238
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:26,529
OK, so going on.

239
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:30,571
My favorite bit, impact, or impacting with impact.

240
00:13:31,091 --> 00:13:35,573
The thing with impact, what I do a lot in games

241
00:13:35,653 --> 00:13:37,814
is I decide on a small audio file.

242
00:13:37,834 --> 00:13:42,236
It would be like, I don't know, 5 to 20 milliseconds long

243
00:13:42,296 --> 00:13:42,877
or something.

244
00:13:43,237 --> 00:13:44,137
My professor's degree.

245
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:49,662
So you have this small, really really like p-p-p-p-p kind of sound,

246
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:52,324
and I would choose that, like a different sound per game,

247
00:13:52,764 --> 00:13:55,146
just like, either like p-p-p-p or like k-k-k or something like that.

248
00:13:55,486 --> 00:14:00,509
I would take a small sound like that and insert that to every sound asset I do to the game.

249
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:04,372
I don't necessarily like looping sounds, but like every single shot sound.

250
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:09,995
Because having that in front, like here's the whole file, I would have it like right at the beginning.

251
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:11,616
What I can do with this is.

252
00:14:13,174 --> 00:14:15,295
I can adjust punch of the sound.

253
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:21,440
If I raise the volume of this sound, it will make the sound like instead of being like

254
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:26,144
you can like adjust the punch of the sound.

255
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:28,686
If you want it to be less punchier, put it quieter.

256
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:31,368
If you want it to be really punchy, put it really high.

257
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:34,991
And with this you can also...

258
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:39,956
like, emphasize bass, make bass feel more like, it sounds more bassier.

259
00:14:40,437 --> 00:14:43,258
So instead of like having a shotgun sound,

260
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:47,421
I would just have, like, shotgun sound being like just boost the bass of that and it's like

261
00:14:47,441 --> 00:14:48,482
bllbbbllbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb

262
00:14:48,502 --> 00:14:51,504
I would have that small pppp sound have like tons of bass.

263
00:14:52,044 --> 00:14:57,567
So that what that does is kind of fools us in a sense, and fools our speakers like subwoofers and stuff.

264
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:03,251
That the small thing only has like a pppp, pppp, really like pppp, pppp, a heavy bass, and then the rest can be normal.

265
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:04,051
Like this...

266
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:12,008
You can just leave the shotgun sound as normal and have a nice punchy tight bass.

267
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:16,113
And if you have like 20 shotguns shooting, the game doesn't go like...

268
00:15:17,655 --> 00:15:18,456
Now the game would be like...

269
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:23,742
So, think about that. That was probably pretty weird.

270
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:27,531
You can emphasize the button press here.

271
00:15:28,351 --> 00:15:32,092
Having that in every sound will make the button press feel like,

272
00:15:32,152 --> 00:15:33,453
hey, I'm pressing buttons.

273
00:15:33,753 --> 00:15:35,933
Especially if every action has that sound.

274
00:15:36,873 --> 00:15:40,554
It just makes it feel like this is what I'm doing, and so on,

275
00:15:40,594 --> 00:15:40,874
and so on.

276
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:42,915
You could have a different sound for maybe the enemies

277
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:43,315
or something.

278
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:43,655
I don't know.

279
00:15:43,715 --> 00:15:44,835
You can experiment with that.

280
00:15:45,755 --> 00:15:48,156
And a good example of having a button press

281
00:15:48,176 --> 00:15:49,956
with that small impact is, let's say

282
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:50,816
you are pulling a lever.

283
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:54,030
Castle Bridge comes down.

284
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,431
If you don't have anything, it's like I press a button.

285
00:15:59,074 --> 00:16:03,017
If you have a small punch sound, but even if it's like bare,

286
00:16:03,057 --> 00:16:04,598
you can't even hear it proper.

287
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:07,580
It's just a feeling like a small bass over there.

288
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,242
It's just like, something like that.

289
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:10,663
And you have that in front.

290
00:16:11,163 --> 00:16:12,364
It's like I press a button.

291
00:16:15,627 --> 00:16:18,569
That small thing makes it feel like I did something.

292
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:19,450
I pressed a button.

293
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:21,709
So on and so on.

294
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:24,489
This makes it feel like I did something instead of me, again,

295
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:26,150
pressing button and that doing it.

296
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,290
So think about that.

297
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,671
Distortion ETC artifacts.

298
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:32,411
Let's move on.

299
00:16:32,671 --> 00:16:35,451
With this, I mean, and now I'm going

300
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:38,272
to easily piss off some people, but you know.

301
00:16:39,352 --> 00:16:40,232
Distortion ETC artifacts.

302
00:16:40,252 --> 00:16:44,813
What I mean with this is kind of like technical flaws

303
00:16:44,853 --> 00:16:45,273
in the game.

304
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:48,354
You can sometimes use these flaws to enhance it.

305
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:49,154
So let's say.

306
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:53,880
You have 20 knights with crazy halibers attacking you.

307
00:16:55,601 --> 00:16:58,002
And the game master, the master channel of the game,

308
00:16:58,062 --> 00:16:59,662
like the in-game audio engine, is like,

309
00:16:59,682 --> 00:17:00,903
pffft, pffft, pffft, pffft, pffft.

310
00:17:00,923 --> 00:17:01,883
There's millions of knights.

311
00:17:01,943 --> 00:17:03,244
It's like, ah, my ears hurt.

312
00:17:03,704 --> 00:17:05,824
Ah, ah, it feels so tense.

313
00:17:05,884 --> 00:17:08,165
And then you slay them, and it's quiet.

314
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:09,866
And you're like, ah, my ears can breathe again.

315
00:17:10,326 --> 00:17:13,387
That might be technically considered as, wow, wow, wow,

316
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,087
you were clipping.

317
00:17:14,147 --> 00:17:15,368
It was not good, not good.

318
00:17:15,808 --> 00:17:17,108
But if it felt good?

319
00:17:19,042 --> 00:17:21,585
Why not? If it's not hurting anyone, it's not breaking anything,

320
00:17:23,147 --> 00:17:24,669
fucking go for it.

321
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:30,055
Another thing, like if you have like master limiter going crazy,

322
00:17:30,095 --> 00:17:33,719
like you're in underground level, all these sound files are base,

323
00:17:34,139 --> 00:17:35,821
and it's like everything feels like,

324
00:17:37,263 --> 00:17:39,886
so what's happening? Out of order, ah.

325
00:17:41,087 --> 00:17:44,770
People would be like, hmm, that's a technical flaw, you're a master limiter and this so and so...

326
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:49,554
Fuck, um, that, no, like, if it felt good, go with it.

327
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:50,655
Ah, jeez.

328
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,497
So, let's move on, I still have a few minutes.

329
00:17:54,218 --> 00:17:55,059
Sound systems.

330
00:17:55,499 --> 00:17:55,959
Ducking.

331
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,602
I don't mean like, quack quack duck, no, it's a shitty joke.

332
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,044
So, um, ducking.

333
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:05,908
With this, you know, you have music playing on the radio, someone talks, the music goes down,

334
00:18:05,948 --> 00:18:07,429
they stop talking, the music comes back up.

335
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:09,411
We use that in video games a lot for...

336
00:18:10,497 --> 00:18:13,558
Like a character talking and the background dims down, right?

337
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:20,560
What if you would use that for actions, for UI,

338
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,900
and stuff like that?

339
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,200
I've been using that for some time

340
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,541
now in games to enhance something.

341
00:18:26,961 --> 00:18:28,161
I'll just give you a quick example.

342
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:30,442
Here's a sound clip with no ducking.

343
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:36,323
It's just someone shooting this background.

344
00:18:36,363 --> 00:18:39,644
What if I put ducking on the weapons?

345
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,441
Let's compare again.

346
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:45,721
No.

347
00:18:49,786 --> 00:18:50,126
Ducking.

348
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:56,955
I don't know if you can hear it through here, but what happens here is.

349
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,300
The shooting became more prominent.

350
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,320
It was more clear.

351
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,621
There was more power.

352
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,682
It was like, hey, I'm doing something that affects the world.

353
00:19:06,122 --> 00:19:08,462
It gives that feeling of power to the player.

354
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:09,442
It's really cool.

355
00:19:10,183 --> 00:19:13,623
And what if you'd apply filtering to that as well?

356
00:19:13,923 --> 00:19:18,645
And by filters, I mean, you know, boom, bomb explodes.

357
00:19:20,774 --> 00:19:21,595
Stuff like that, right?

358
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,116
Maybe some ear ringing, whatever.

359
00:19:24,137 --> 00:19:26,678
What if you'd apply that to the actions as well?

360
00:19:26,838 --> 00:19:29,240
So let's do the clip with no ducking.

361
00:19:33,303 --> 00:19:33,823
With ducking.

362
00:19:36,745 --> 00:19:37,386
With filtering.

363
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:43,991
Or it feels like, like, grr.

364
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:47,127
Of course I'm like over-accenting right now.

365
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:48,908
Now it's like overly accented.

366
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:52,790
But if you do that slightly, it will bring so much power

367
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,092
and feeling for the actions.

368
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:59,755
And you could apply that to anything, like UI, or jumping,

369
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:00,275
or whatever.

370
00:20:00,555 --> 00:20:05,238
It's just even having a slight amount makes it feel better.

371
00:20:05,258 --> 00:20:06,659
It feels like I'm doing something.

372
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,001
Or if there's a powerful enemy, and it's like,

373
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:13,183
it's like, oh, this is the most powerful thing ever.

374
00:20:13,763 --> 00:20:13,883
And.

375
00:20:15,554 --> 00:20:18,095
And you could have like different stages of this.

376
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:19,796
You could have like loose weapons like...

377
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:21,757
You could have like a shotgun...

378
00:20:22,337 --> 00:20:24,218
Or you could have like rocket launchers...

379
00:20:24,758 --> 00:20:29,600
You could like bring feel before even affecting like mixed balances.

380
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,261
You would just like do ducking balances.

381
00:20:32,462 --> 00:20:34,963
And that already does a cool thing.

382
00:20:35,823 --> 00:20:35,943
So...

383
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:40,717
But with sound systems, give priority to what is important.

384
00:20:41,237 --> 00:20:44,198
Like, don't just create a lot of sound systems and like,

385
00:20:44,278 --> 00:20:46,079
everything's ducking, everything's doing that,

386
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,220
I have this cool reverb thing, occlusion, whatever.

387
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:54,261
So, you have all this cool stuff, but if it starts to make the game feel like

388
00:20:54,382 --> 00:20:57,783
more like a technical demo than a game or something, like, if it doesn't...

389
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:03,708
feel good anymore, introduces like input lag or whatever, just take it out.

390
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:08,592
You don't need to join the fashion club of technical people, just do something that feels good.

391
00:21:09,053 --> 00:21:15,739
Because nothing is as irritating as loosening the feel or breaking the illusion of the game that,

392
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:16,680
hey, I'm doing this.

393
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:24,557
Keep focus of the game always number one thing, and if you do that, the game will feel much better.

394
00:21:24,998 --> 00:21:26,279
And thank you!

395
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,904
Follow me on Twitter if you want to talk to me about stuff related to this.

396
00:21:30,964 --> 00:21:33,126
I'm here today, tomorrow maybe.

397
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:35,668
If I find accommodation, I might be here longer.

398
00:21:35,949 --> 00:21:37,410
So, cool.

399
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:40,153
We have like three minutes for Q&A.

400
00:21:40,893 --> 00:21:41,394
Any questions?

401
00:21:47,952 --> 00:21:49,433
I told you it's really compressed.

402
00:21:50,674 --> 00:21:51,514
Are you ready for questions?

403
00:21:54,717 --> 00:21:57,078
I'm going to go straight into a slightly technical question.

404
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:01,382
You mentioned setting up your master chain in your DAW.

405
00:22:02,562 --> 00:22:05,665
In Logic, when you want to export all the tracks as separate sounds,

406
00:22:05,885 --> 00:22:07,926
and you hit that export all sounds as tracks,

407
00:22:08,387 --> 00:22:10,688
it doesn't put them through the master chain.

408
00:22:10,748 --> 00:22:13,050
It puts them all through their own insert thing.

409
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,671
So you end up doing loads of inserts, I think.

410
00:22:15,452 --> 00:22:17,413
Or have you found that you can do that in Logic?

411
00:22:18,124 --> 00:22:21,565
But you can do a workaround with this, that you create a track,

412
00:22:22,085 --> 00:22:24,586
and you record all those layers in that track.

413
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:26,706
Done.

414
00:22:27,866 --> 00:22:28,966
You put all... oh, you...

415
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:31,727
You route them to a track, and you record to that track,

416
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:33,547
and then you have, like, that sound file there.

417
00:22:33,587 --> 00:22:36,848
Like, you would make a master aux, like auxiliary,

418
00:22:37,268 --> 00:22:39,209
and you would route that, like, everything through that,

419
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:40,669
into an audio track.

420
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:42,009
Empty audio track.

421
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:43,430
And then you record that audio track.

422
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:46,788
But that will then put them all together on that audio track.

423
00:22:47,088 --> 00:22:49,750
But when you're wanting to get all your sounds out of separate files...

424
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,131
Like, as in for a...

425
00:22:52,851 --> 00:22:54,612
Let's say like Ys or Fm or something.

426
00:22:54,632 --> 00:22:55,892
Yeah.

427
00:22:55,952 --> 00:22:56,913
Do a master chain on that.

428
00:22:58,316 --> 00:22:59,657
In FMOD.

429
00:22:59,697 --> 00:23:04,100
Yeah, I know we're putting the sounds straight into Unity, so then you don't have the master chain.

430
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,242
So there isn't a way to put your master chain onto all the individual...

431
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,784
Oh, do it, all the individual ones as well.

432
00:23:10,164 --> 00:23:13,266
Just put the same fucking chain at the end.

433
00:23:13,286 --> 00:23:15,528
So you copy the chain onto every track?

434
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:16,509
Yeah, that's what I would do.

435
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,970
Oh, okay. Yeah, that's what I've been doing. Thanks.

436
00:23:19,311 --> 00:23:19,451
Yes!

437
00:23:23,762 --> 00:23:26,624
Do you have some example of that impact you've mentioned earlier?

438
00:23:27,124 --> 00:23:28,605
Oh, didn't I play it? Okay.

439
00:23:30,646 --> 00:23:31,347
Jump shorter.

440
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,869
Now we play small impact sound to emphasize button press.

441
00:23:39,052 --> 00:23:41,394
I don't know, can you really hear it right now?

442
00:23:41,514 --> 00:23:45,337
But if you have that same impact for, let's say, dodging as well, stuff like that,

443
00:23:45,937 --> 00:23:48,759
it will make the dodging and jumping kind of feel...

444
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:50,661
like, make the button press feel similar.

445
00:23:51,676 --> 00:23:53,958
I can give you more examples later on if you want.

446
00:23:54,738 --> 00:23:54,898
Yeah.

447
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:56,119
I don't know who did that.

448
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:00,122
Hi.

449
00:24:00,702 --> 00:24:02,984
Are there any virtual instruments that you

450
00:24:03,104 --> 00:24:04,645
use that you can advertise?

451
00:24:05,665 --> 00:24:06,226
Advertise?

452
00:24:06,246 --> 00:24:09,328
I mean, that are good.

453
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:11,509
We are not supposed to advertise in GDC.

454
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,111
No one's paying me, so I'm not advertising anything.

455
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:15,092
Oh, no.

456
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:15,512
Ha, ha.

457
00:24:15,812 --> 00:24:17,093
Ha, ha.

458
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:20,475
VSTs that I use, like instruments.

459
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:21,196
Yeah.

460
00:24:23,025 --> 00:24:24,786
I use Pro Tools' own instruments.

461
00:24:24,806 --> 00:24:27,728
They're pretty lame, but they work, so why not?

462
00:24:28,889 --> 00:24:33,112
I don't really... I record most stuff myself, so I would use, like, real instruments.

463
00:24:33,692 --> 00:24:37,394
Unless it's like an orchestra, I would use, I don't know, EastWest or something.

464
00:24:38,195 --> 00:24:39,175
I don't know. I don't...

465
00:24:41,056 --> 00:24:43,778
Maybe later, if you get me a drink, we can talk about this.

466
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,841
We do have time for one more.

467
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:50,422
One more. That guy's been holding his hand for a long time.

468
00:24:57,607 --> 00:24:57,867
Thanks.

469
00:24:58,428 --> 00:24:59,189
Um, alright.

470
00:24:59,469 --> 00:25:04,235
You said that you want to make sounds shorter, right?

471
00:25:04,255 --> 00:25:05,397
Uh, excuse me?

472
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:10,884
You said that you want to make sounds shorter.

473
00:25:11,484 --> 00:25:11,625
Yeah.

474
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:21,850
Right. So I was wondering if repetitive, long sounds don't become earworms.

475
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:27,474
Like if you ever played Zelda, the Link's going like,

476
00:25:27,614 --> 00:25:29,515
well, I can't do sounds.

477
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:30,015
Yeah.

478
00:25:30,355 --> 00:25:31,016
You know what I mean.

479
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:31,616
Yeah.

480
00:25:32,777 --> 00:25:36,839
Doesn't that help to make game feel better or something?

481
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:40,041
Yeah. Of course, when I say make sounds shorter,

482
00:25:41,153 --> 00:25:46,815
It doesn't necessarily apply to everything, but like that link thing, that's the feel thing.

483
00:25:46,835 --> 00:25:52,157
They're like, okay, having like a long attack, they're like, that feels good.

484
00:25:52,377 --> 00:25:54,078
They were like, fuck it, it feels good, let's do it.

485
00:25:55,318 --> 00:25:55,878
Swearing again.

486
00:25:56,298 --> 00:25:58,339
So they're like, yeah, it feels good, like let's do it.

487
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:02,580
So if it feels good, like ignore, if anything feels better than this,

488
00:26:02,981 --> 00:26:05,621
my own personal rule set, go for it.

489
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:06,802
If it feels good, it feels good.

490
00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:07,942
So like.

491
00:26:08,464 --> 00:26:11,165
What I do is I usually start by making sounds shorter,

492
00:26:11,286 --> 00:26:13,167
unless a longer version feels better.

493
00:26:13,187 --> 00:26:17,110
And it's like totally up to the occasion.

494
00:26:20,252 --> 00:26:20,612
Yeah.

495
00:26:21,273 --> 00:26:21,793
All right.

496
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:22,153
Thank you.

497
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:24,975
One more round of applause for Jonas Stirner.
