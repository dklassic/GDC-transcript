1
00:00:03,767 --> 00:00:05,430
Okay, hi.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:09,656
First, please turn the silent mode on,

3
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:11,018
on your phones, please, okay?

4
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:14,463
And after the talk, please fill the feedback forms wherever.

5
00:00:14,483 --> 00:00:16,025
I hope it's gonna get positive.

6
00:00:17,707 --> 00:00:17,928
Okay.

7
00:00:19,055 --> 00:00:19,435
Hi.

8
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:21,597
I'm super happy for being here.

9
00:00:22,057 --> 00:00:24,059
I'm even more happy seeing someone here,

10
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:27,721
and even extremely happy to see so much talent here.

11
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,404
Thank you for doing that, because this is my first time

12
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:34,446
GDC ever, and of course, first time doing speech here.

13
00:00:34,907 --> 00:00:38,830
So the stress level is high, but excitement, I think,

14
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,590
is even higher.

15
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:41,672
So thank you so much for doing this,

16
00:00:42,152 --> 00:00:43,613
and thank you for being here with me.

17
00:00:44,374 --> 00:00:47,156
My name is Kasper, and I do environment art

18
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:48,657
at CD Projekt RED.

19
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,716
And probably some of you are thinking right now,

20
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,418
that dude just misspelt his studio name right there.

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:54,979
But I did not.

22
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:55,820
Oh, sorry.

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:56,740
I did not.

24
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,262
That's how it's pronounced and spelled.

25
00:00:59,603 --> 00:01:01,104
Project means project in Polish.

26
00:01:01,624 --> 00:01:02,745
And I'm just saying that because we

27
00:01:02,765 --> 00:01:04,446
have tons and tons of questions about that.

28
00:01:04,746 --> 00:01:06,528
That's not an issue.

29
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:08,229
It's like, it's a Polish company name.

30
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:10,090
So that's why it's CD Projekt Red.

31
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,392
Of course, you can call it CD Projekt Red also.

32
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:14,734
But it's GDC, right?

33
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:16,575
So we are here to share knowledge.

34
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:18,877
So right now, I'm just learning how to speak Polish.

35
00:01:19,337 --> 00:01:20,218
Right?

36
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:21,719
One of the hardest languages in the world.

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,741
But the ultimate test for you guys

38
00:01:24,321 --> 00:01:27,624
is if someone's going to pronounce my last name correctly,

39
00:01:28,024 --> 00:01:28,804
I will buy you a beer.

40
00:01:29,985 --> 00:01:30,386
Seriously.

41
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:33,028
Keep that in mind.

42
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:33,328
OK?

43
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,029
OK.

44
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:36,890
So without further ado, we're going

45
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,632
to talk about how we managed to build Boclaire.

46
00:01:40,413 --> 00:01:43,936
But before I'm going to start, I will ask you a few questions.

47
00:01:44,296 --> 00:01:46,638
First of all, who played The Witcher Wild Hunt?

48
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:49,359
OK, nice.

49
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:50,900
Thank you, guys.

50
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,520
Who played Hearts of Stone?

51
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:54,801
OK.

52
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:55,982
I'm Blown Wine?

53
00:01:57,602 --> 00:02:00,203
OK, that's actually good that not every single one

54
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:01,044
played the game.

55
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:04,705
So to give you kind of the background about the things

56
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,826
we're going to talk today, I would just

57
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,047
play the teaser for you guys.

58
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:13,209
Good.

59
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:13,489
Thank you.

60
00:02:20,887 --> 00:02:23,469
To Sam, the land of love and wine.

61
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,611
Exactly how I remembered it.

62
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:47,951
So whoever played the game, just do it.

63
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:53,105
The game itself for us was a huge challenge.

64
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:55,046
The things I'm going to talk today about

65
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:57,287
was a teamwork effort.

66
00:02:57,727 --> 00:02:59,248
So I'm just going to say that I'm

67
00:02:59,268 --> 00:03:01,649
super proud of being part of the best team in the world,

68
00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:03,230
both in Krakow and Warsaw.

69
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,531
I love you guys and hope to see you soon.

70
00:03:05,911 --> 00:03:08,292
But clap your hands for those really cool guys

71
00:03:09,152 --> 00:03:10,013
back in our office.

72
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:10,713
Thank you so much.

73
00:03:13,414 --> 00:03:13,675
Thank you.

74
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:18,264
OK, so it was a huge challenge for us, because as you know,

75
00:03:18,284 --> 00:03:20,505
Blood and Wine is an expansion pack.

76
00:03:21,245 --> 00:03:23,226
But content-wise, it's a triple A game.

77
00:03:23,866 --> 00:03:26,327
So we had a very short time for doing this,

78
00:03:26,587 --> 00:03:29,288
but lots and lots of things to do content-wise.

79
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:33,270
Also, it has a new setting.

80
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:36,752
So for those of you who haven't played the game,

81
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:38,733
the basic game, Wild Hunt.

82
00:03:40,105 --> 00:03:44,887
Wild Hunt is kind of a game that is not the place you would like to go for a vacation.

83
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:45,867
I can guarantee you that.

84
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:49,309
Even I was afraid of doing that sometimes.

85
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,511
So it was kind of dark, dreamish, dangerous, gory.

86
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:59,773
And art had to support this feeling of kind of dangerous, right?

87
00:04:00,672 --> 00:04:02,674
But on the other hand, as you saw on the teaser,

88
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:05,836
Toussaint is very vibrant, very colorful.

89
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,717
We used very saturated colors

90
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:11,019
just to give the feel of happiness

91
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,541
because it's actually a land of happiness.

92
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:14,822
People are drunk there all the time,

93
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:16,263
drinking wine, that's why they're happy.

94
00:04:18,004 --> 00:04:18,525
I would go there.

95
00:04:18,865 --> 00:04:20,887
So this is the place for you guys to go to visit

96
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:21,727
for vacation.

97
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:24,869
It was inspired, of course we got the basic idea

98
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,892
from the books, but we got inspired by France and Italy.

99
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:30,714
You know, like lots of wineries there,

100
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:32,775
super sunny days, it's awesome.

101
00:04:33,276 --> 00:04:35,257
But on the other hand, it is the Witcher game,

102
00:04:35,457 --> 00:04:38,780
so we had to create this second bottom,

103
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,542
this kind of darkish bottom, because again,

104
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:44,103
Witcher Geralt is monster slayer,

105
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,865
so he has to do somewhere there, right?

106
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:48,347
So it was a challenge for us.

107
00:04:49,468 --> 00:04:52,631
Also, we had to create another city, which

108
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:55,613
was different than Novigrad from the base game.

109
00:04:56,174 --> 00:04:58,736
And we had some kind of art goals for us.

110
00:04:59,677 --> 00:05:01,258
And those art goals, for instance, were.

111
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:05,614
We have to go with different things that we did in Novigrad.

112
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:08,196
Different architecture, different color,

113
00:05:08,456 --> 00:05:10,156
different overall feel.

114
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,898
And also, we're trying to make some improvements,

115
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:17,840
like put more content there, put more crowds in the streets,

116
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,221
and make the city feel even more alive

117
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:22,222
that it was done in Novigrad.

118
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:26,123
But content, more content, packed content.

119
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:27,629
We're doing games, right?

120
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,752
And we got our tech goals also, unfortunately.

121
00:05:31,273 --> 00:05:33,795
So we have to figure out how we can,

122
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:36,718
those two goals, the tech goals on one side

123
00:05:36,758 --> 00:05:38,740
and the art goals on the other side,

124
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,560
how we can...

125
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:44,413
find like a balance between those and figure out what we can do because those

126
00:05:44,453 --> 00:05:44,753
goals

127
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:48,534
they kinda didn't like each other. They were going each separate way

128
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:53,356
and didn't want to cross somewhere. So this talk basically is how we managed to

129
00:05:54,096 --> 00:05:57,917
marry our art goals with tech goals

130
00:05:58,297 --> 00:05:59,917
having around 700 megabytes

131
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:01,358
for usage.

132
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:05,979
So I will cover

133
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:10,594
how we design the city, what was our artistic vision for it,

134
00:06:11,034 --> 00:06:13,296
what kind of challenges we had and how we solved those,

135
00:06:14,377 --> 00:06:16,419
what kind of performance goals we had

136
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,261
because we were trying to put the game

137
00:06:18,341 --> 00:06:19,842
on every available hardware at that time,

138
00:06:20,643 --> 00:06:23,285
and we also did a few improvements to our pipeline.

139
00:06:23,545 --> 00:06:24,746
At the end, I hope, I'm pretty sure

140
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:26,928
you're gonna have some time to answer your questions.

141
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:28,990
But we got a lot of things to cover,

142
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,572
so without further ado, guys, let's go.

143
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,801
As probably you know, because you should know,

144
00:06:37,262 --> 00:06:39,002
that every single project should start

145
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:41,184
with pre-production and planning.

146
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:43,085
It's safer like that, basically.

147
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:47,287
So our city, because I will talk monotonously

148
00:06:47,347 --> 00:06:49,668
all about the city itself, the basic idea

149
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,769
was taken from the books.

150
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:54,150
Having the experience from Wild Hunt,

151
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,591
we knew how extremely important it

152
00:06:56,611 --> 00:07:00,153
is to create a very friendly for the player navigation

153
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,454
within the urban environments.

154
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:02,754
Because.

155
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:09,336
he has to have fun there, not be frustrated because he doesn't know where he's at. So we knew

156
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:14,718
that this is something we need to figure and this is our key goal at this point. So we started

157
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:20,280
with things that are in the books. And in the books we have of course the city itself, which

158
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:28,842
also worked as the navigation point for the city itself from different districts. We took

159
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:34,966
the Gorgon Mountain, which is the biggest mountain in Toussaint.

160
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:39,969
It serves the purpose of a landmark for the whole world,

161
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:42,630
but also for the city itself, because it's very, very tall.

162
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,993
So a player can navigate seeing the Gorgon Mountain.

163
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:53,226
And Palace, which is kind of above the city, which helps us

164
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,387
also to create this another navigation point for the player

165
00:07:56,447 --> 00:08:00,529
to keep an eye on going to this kind of north part of the town.

166
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,152
So having those three pillars, we start

167
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:06,953
building the first layout.

168
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:09,894
We also knew that the town is on a slope.

169
00:08:10,034 --> 00:08:13,416
So we figured out how we're going to have it set up

170
00:08:13,596 --> 00:08:14,276
at the first draft.

171
00:08:19,251 --> 00:08:21,613
This is our first draft for the layout.

172
00:08:22,574 --> 00:08:24,215
We divided it into four districts.

173
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:26,917
The reason for that was to make the structure

174
00:08:26,997 --> 00:08:31,020
more logically and easy to kind of support.

175
00:08:31,441 --> 00:08:35,064
And also, it was easier for us to delegate the work

176
00:08:35,104 --> 00:08:37,485
for different artists throughout the different districts.

177
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:41,248
And here you got the same layout with those things

178
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:44,051
that were, for us at that point, very important.

179
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:46,873
We had those green parts are the

180
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:52,436
Locations that the story team and quest team provide us,

181
00:08:52,996 --> 00:08:55,256
like number one, it's market square.

182
00:08:55,276 --> 00:08:57,117
Number two, a cemetery temple.

183
00:08:58,017 --> 00:08:59,937
Number four, those are stables.

184
00:09:00,137 --> 00:09:03,078
And number three and five, those are some kind of parks

185
00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:04,178
at that point in the town.

186
00:09:04,218 --> 00:09:06,838
And number six is by the lake, a really cool place

187
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:09,219
you can hang out with your wine in Buclaire.

188
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:12,339
We also have the streets or the paths

189
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:13,720
the player could take at that point.

190
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,540
And those yellow dots, those were the gates.

191
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:23,556
So we started to test the layout, the block out, and this

192
00:09:23,676 --> 00:09:26,799
is how it looked at that point. We of course used gray meshes.

193
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:29,782
We also had some kind of more high quality meshes at that

194
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:32,505
point because some artists were doing that. But we did

195
00:09:32,545 --> 00:09:36,769
everything we could to support that landmark navigation part.

196
00:09:36,889 --> 00:09:39,532
In here you can see the mountain in the back.

197
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:49,620
Here, we're by the lake, and we still can see the Gorgon Mountain, but also you can see the palace over there.

198
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:56,249
So going there, you know you're going to the north part of the town, or to the palace, one of the most important locations in our game.

199
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:06,120
different location, different spot in the town, still palace is super easy spot for the player.

200
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:13,704
So he's got this different signs basically where you want to go and which way he should go.

201
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:21,627
The other thing that helped us a lot was the thing that the town itself was on a slope.

202
00:10:22,027 --> 00:10:26,730
So basically the player could learn very easily and very fast that the higher he goes,

203
00:10:27,531 --> 00:10:30,033
the more rich part of the town he's going to explore.

204
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:37,238
And in our case, the Elven Palace has a different architecture type because it's Elven Palace, right?

205
00:10:37,578 --> 00:10:42,902
So the higher the player goes, the different districts he will explore.

206
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,183
And the Elven Palace on the top...

207
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:47,665
kind of lower, we got the rich part of the town,

208
00:10:47,985 --> 00:10:50,006
even lower, we got the poor part of the town,

209
00:10:50,366 --> 00:10:52,708
and on the bottom of the slope, we got the harbor.

210
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,509
And also, those different districts

211
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:56,470
had different architecture types,

212
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,592
so also, it supported the different feel

213
00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:01,433
and uniqueness to every district.

214
00:11:02,754 --> 00:11:05,456
So we had it done, basically, we're happy about that,

215
00:11:05,496 --> 00:11:07,837
we have it, probably thinking about, okay, it's done.

216
00:11:08,277 --> 00:11:08,718
But was it?

217
00:11:09,318 --> 00:11:09,698
How do you think?

218
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:11,511
Not really.

219
00:11:11,992 --> 00:11:15,154
We had some spots very hard for the player

220
00:11:15,194 --> 00:11:17,815
to figure out where he's at, because it was hard for him

221
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:20,057
to see the landmarks.

222
00:11:21,017 --> 00:11:22,538
Also, at that point, we were trying

223
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:25,941
to figure out how we can create very long distances

224
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:27,962
for very long views, basically.

225
00:11:28,602 --> 00:11:30,724
We were kind of thinking about that that might be kind

226
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:34,546
of expensive, but still we were figuring, OK, let's do it.

227
00:11:34,586 --> 00:11:34,886
Why not?

228
00:11:36,017 --> 00:11:41,542
And here is the example of that you don't see Gorgon Mountain.

229
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,224
The small mountain over there is not Gorgon.

230
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:45,006
And you don't see the palace.

231
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,330
So just a tree is kind of not enough for the player

232
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,771
to figure out where he's at.

233
00:11:51,893 --> 00:11:53,415
So we have spots like that.

234
00:11:54,316 --> 00:11:57,459
And also like here, very long street.

235
00:11:58,238 --> 00:12:00,898
which I can imagine that it would look awesome in a game,

236
00:12:01,018 --> 00:12:03,219
but still it might get expensive.

237
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:04,979
And if you're gonna see on the left,

238
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:07,480
we're gonna have the parts of market square there,

239
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,740
which also we knew at that point

240
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,380
that gonna get very dense with crowds

241
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,861
and different decorations.

242
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:16,762
So we found those spots and we figured,

243
00:12:16,842 --> 00:12:18,662
okay, that might be actually too risky

244
00:12:18,982 --> 00:12:20,662
to leave it like that, we need to do something with it.

245
00:12:21,342 --> 00:12:23,763
So we grabbed our shovels and start to play

246
00:12:23,803 --> 00:12:26,143
with the lockout again, with gray box in bed.

247
00:12:26,969 --> 00:12:30,591
But also what we did, we introduced in-city landmarks

248
00:12:30,691 --> 00:12:31,071
itself.

249
00:12:31,732 --> 00:12:35,414
We used the palace again, but still we used it even more.

250
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:39,677
We wanted the player to be actually kind of seeing

251
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,598
the palace all the time.

252
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:44,701
Also, we went with City Hall.

253
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,002
At the beginning, we knew we were

254
00:12:46,022 --> 00:12:47,203
going to have City Hall in our town,

255
00:12:47,263 --> 00:12:49,884
but still we made it kind of bigger, taller,

256
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:51,806
so it's actually going to serve as a landmark.

257
00:12:52,818 --> 00:12:57,021
And we got Temple in the south part of the town,

258
00:12:57,281 --> 00:12:59,963
which also serves the purpose of getting the player

259
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:03,285
to the different cemetery part of the Bucclere.

260
00:13:04,966 --> 00:13:06,808
This is the concept art, by the way,

261
00:13:07,508 --> 00:13:09,550
we have, again, great cooperation

262
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,931
of concept artists in our company.

263
00:13:12,051 --> 00:13:14,873
So this, on the left, is like the first iteration

264
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:16,394
of this Temple, the one on the right

265
00:13:16,474 --> 00:13:18,156
is the more in-game finished model.

266
00:13:18,676 --> 00:13:20,297
But then again, it really worked.

267
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:25,369
I know it looks like a rocket right now, but still it worked.

268
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:27,430
We knew that even from the distance,

269
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:31,013
the player can see something that will grab him and tell him

270
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:33,335
go there if you want to go to the south part or the cemetery

271
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:33,635
part.

272
00:13:34,796 --> 00:13:36,677
And this is the same location as we saw before,

273
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,519
but with the temple in the back.

274
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:42,382
You can see the rocket top tip of it in the back.

275
00:13:48,946 --> 00:13:49,727
Again, next lake.

276
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,852
palace, Gorgon Mountain, and the temple.

277
00:13:54,112 --> 00:13:56,113
So here is like a junction.

278
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:57,194
You know when you want to go

279
00:13:57,214 --> 00:13:58,775
because you see all those landmarks.

280
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,738
So the palace, again, at the beginning,

281
00:14:06,758 --> 00:14:07,618
we used it as a landmark.

282
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:11,699
But here, we kind of even more use it

283
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:13,539
for the purpose of doing that.

284
00:14:13,779 --> 00:14:15,659
We bent even the streets in the town

285
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:18,740
just to make it push the player towards the palace,

286
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,441
because it was super important for us to be

287
00:14:21,481 --> 00:14:22,581
able to go there very easily.

288
00:14:28,722 --> 00:14:30,502
Next was the city hall, which was

289
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:32,823
in the center of Buccleuch, here.

290
00:14:33,766 --> 00:14:37,448
And that landmark, grab the player and tell him how to get

291
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:40,130
to the center of the boucle or to the main square.

292
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,491
And here you can see going from the main gate,

293
00:14:44,412 --> 00:14:46,193
you are going straight to the market square

294
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:49,415
through the town hall, city hall, town hall.

295
00:14:52,837 --> 00:14:55,118
Different location, different spot in the town.

296
00:14:55,358 --> 00:14:57,479
Still, we can see the tip of the building there

297
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,541
that can guide you to the market square.

298
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:14,473
So we had again another passive iteration, things to cover, to fix basically, but then we got

299
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:22,842
information about how things are going to get restricted by technical goals. And yes, we

300
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:29,646
actually got accepted that long views within the city might get too expensive so we need to

301
00:15:29,966 --> 00:15:35,749
figure something out with those really long views and long streets. So again, we grabbed our

302
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:41,511
shovels and went back to look at the things. And here is our famous long street.

303
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:46,038
But at the end, you can see we put some arches there

304
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:48,339
to create this visual blocker for the player

305
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:50,680
to break down the long line of sight.

306
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:53,122
And on the left, we also use this kind

307
00:15:53,142 --> 00:15:54,442
of eye-catching distractions.

308
00:15:55,243 --> 00:15:57,424
So the player probably going to miss some things that will

309
00:15:57,444 --> 00:15:59,665
stream or pop or the load's going to switch.

310
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:01,266
So basically, we just wanted to figure out

311
00:16:01,406 --> 00:16:07,070
how we can make cool things with shorter line of sights.

312
00:16:09,588 --> 00:16:10,229
and we did that a lot.

313
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:12,611
Like even here, it's not like 100% blocker,

314
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:15,074
but enough for you to catch your distraction,

315
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,537
distract your eye to figure out what's in front of you,

316
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:19,699
not trying to pay attention to what's behind you.

317
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,262
And the reason for that was that we just went

318
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:25,926
and tried to hide the poppings, swappings, meshes,

319
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,548
and streaming meshes into the memory.

320
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:28,669
That was the whole thing.

321
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,645
And a really cool example here was the main square.

322
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:40,270
And the main square was actually the most demanding location

323
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,351
throughout the whole game.

324
00:16:42,152 --> 00:16:42,812
And why?

325
00:16:43,513 --> 00:16:45,275
This is the top down view of the main square.

326
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:48,538
And right now the main square is in a state

327
00:16:48,578 --> 00:16:51,340
with wine festival going on within the story of the game.

328
00:16:52,584 --> 00:16:56,146
And the wine festival itself, it's packed with decoration,

329
00:16:56,506 --> 00:16:59,328
location, we've got tents there filled with tables with food.

330
00:16:59,648 --> 00:17:02,329
You've got many NPCs there, two stages,

331
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:04,030
people are having fun, it's really cool,

332
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,712
nice place to go there basically to have some fun.

333
00:17:07,092 --> 00:17:12,675
But we also had one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

334
00:17:13,696 --> 00:17:15,597
We had this and seven houses.

335
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:18,419
And those houses were with interiors.

336
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:20,520
Later on, I will explain to you why

337
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,461
that is crucial information for us at this point,

338
00:17:22,481 --> 00:17:24,923
but still, we got seven houses with interiors,

339
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:26,584
full decoration interiors.

340
00:17:27,184 --> 00:17:31,367
And the green spot, basically, it's city hall.

341
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:34,289
I'm sorry, club hall.

342
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,471
This is actually the solution we used

343
00:17:38,231 --> 00:17:40,512
for this yellow area here,

344
00:17:40,573 --> 00:17:41,873
which was super, super demanding.

345
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:49,248
And Glovehole is this visual blocker that we create to cut off the main square from the other

346
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:54,713
parts of the town just to make it possible for the engine to stream all those different things

347
00:17:54,773 --> 00:18:01,639
into the memory because it's a lot of things. And it actually worked because we figured, we ended

348
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:09,446
up with really cool location, really cool place, but still you cannot see anything one before going

349
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:10,306
to the main square.

350
00:18:11,212 --> 00:18:13,834
So the engine can get the time to stream all those things

351
00:18:13,915 --> 00:18:14,555
into the memory.

352
00:18:15,035 --> 00:18:17,317
And once you're going to go around the small wall,

353
00:18:17,718 --> 00:18:19,779
you're in the market square, which is ready to go,

354
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:20,360
ready to play.

355
00:18:24,944 --> 00:18:26,145
And we did this a lot.

356
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:28,907
This is, again, our famous street, long one.

357
00:18:30,628 --> 00:18:32,510
As you can see, we kind of pushed a little bit further

358
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,992
that kind of visual blocker, the visual wall.

359
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:37,834
But still we have those distractions on the left.

360
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:41,976
So it's hard to figure out if the things are changing

361
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:43,017
and popping in front of you.

362
00:18:43,637 --> 00:18:45,379
Of course, we had to put a restaurant there, because why

363
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:45,839
not?

364
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,943
And behind the restaurant, we got the actual wall,

365
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:54,888
just to cut off the lake park with the center part.

366
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:59,392
And of course, we ended up with really cool structures

367
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:01,034
for the player to explore.

368
00:19:03,825 --> 00:19:06,787
Also, Bucclear is very different in verticality,

369
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:08,208
so that helps us a lot also.

370
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:10,989
So here, it's hard for you to see what's above you.

371
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:12,550
But once you're going to get there,

372
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,611
you're going to see everything is in the memory streamed in.

373
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:17,653
So like here, you've got the splats by the bank.

374
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:21,054
But you're going to see it around the front.

375
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:22,715
You're going to get there, basically.

376
00:19:25,237 --> 00:19:27,238
Similar situation here, but the other way around.

377
00:19:27,518 --> 00:19:29,599
It's hard for you to see what's beneath you

378
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,420
until you're going to get, basically, to this part.

379
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:37,704
by the barrier. So those things beneath you, you cannot see right now,

380
00:19:37,764 --> 00:19:42,706
they're probably going to be streamed in the memory and all is working good.

381
00:19:47,768 --> 00:19:52,430
We also, the things you saw before, we kind of mixed it up, the visual kind of

382
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:59,333
distraction plus this different height variation. So also, you probably don't want

383
00:19:59,354 --> 00:20:00,494
to see things that are going to be.

384
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:04,244
popping there because of that structure.

385
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:10,708
And the last thing we did, all the time,

386
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:12,769
we did bend the streets.

387
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:14,650
First of all, it looked very natural,

388
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,752
and second of all, it actually breaks the line of sight

389
00:20:18,912 --> 00:20:20,513
pretty well and looks really nice.

390
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:22,954
So it's not like a straight line,

391
00:20:22,974 --> 00:20:25,016
you need to take at least two turns

392
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:26,556
to see the end of the streets.

393
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:40,770
So in that show, for this part, we knew how we need to control our line of sight, our visibility.

394
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:48,096
On the blockout itself, we had tons of different teams working, like story team, quest team, audio team,

395
00:20:48,577 --> 00:20:54,061
different mission designers team, and they provide us with tons and tons of feedback.

396
00:20:54,462 --> 00:21:00,227
And that feedback for us was like a gold, because we're always trying to figure out how we can improve the things we are doing here.

397
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,808
And we were trying to get the results,

398
00:21:02,949 --> 00:21:05,670
which was the high quality block out at that stage, right?

399
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:08,232
So I have really cool examples for the feedback.

400
00:21:08,452 --> 00:21:11,154
Like here, we are going from point B to A,

401
00:21:11,554 --> 00:21:13,235
and we just move those houses away

402
00:21:13,275 --> 00:21:14,636
to create this small path here,

403
00:21:14,956 --> 00:21:17,478
which is kind of basic idea, right?

404
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,019
But we didn't see that before.

405
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:23,081
We were going all around from point A to B

406
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:24,923
with those red lines.

407
00:21:25,603 --> 00:21:26,704
And those guys tell us.

408
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,186
It's going to get boring, it's going to get frustrating.

409
00:21:29,306 --> 00:21:29,966
Do something with that.

410
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:30,587
We did.

411
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:33,289
Super easy spot, super easy fix, but it worked.

412
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:37,332
Similar here, from A to B, it's super short right now.

413
00:21:37,852 --> 00:21:39,774
But think about going from B to A,

414
00:21:40,254 --> 00:21:42,356
all around those different streets.

415
00:21:43,096 --> 00:21:46,379
It might be a cool one, two or three times, but 20, 15 times,

416
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,040
probably not that much.

417
00:21:48,805 --> 00:21:51,709
So we're trying to figure out how we can give the player more

418
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:56,194
options, and more choices, and more exploration

419
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:57,957
within our booklet town.

420
00:21:59,158 --> 00:22:00,940
And the last one is kind of more hardcore,

421
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,562
because it was done.

422
00:22:03,661 --> 00:22:04,881
just before the launch of the game,

423
00:22:05,162 --> 00:22:06,682
we're going from A to C right now.

424
00:22:06,942 --> 00:22:09,103
So basically, we're going from the top part of the city

425
00:22:09,323 --> 00:22:10,183
to the harbor part.

426
00:22:10,844 --> 00:22:14,605
And before, you had to go all around with the red line.

427
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:16,646
But right now, you've got a really cool view,

428
00:22:16,746 --> 00:22:18,526
and you've got a highway to harbor.

429
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:24,228
And it was a risky decision, because it kind of cost us

430
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:25,869
some time to do that.

431
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:27,830
But still, it was totally worth it.

432
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,870
Because right now, it's much easier

433
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:32,611
to get to the different parts of town and faster.

434
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:39,747
So all those things we did led us for this layout, basically.

435
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:42,729
This is the final layout in the game you're going to see,

436
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:43,429
you're going to play.

437
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,011
So the old one versus the new one.

438
00:22:47,312 --> 00:22:49,073
On your left, you're going to see the old one, which

439
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:53,475
was very simple, probably not that exciting.

440
00:22:54,496 --> 00:22:55,476
But the one on the right.

441
00:22:57,048 --> 00:22:58,889
Probably going to get some much, much more fun there,

442
00:22:59,309 --> 00:22:59,949
more options.

443
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,410
But still, if you're going to figure out the number one

444
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,731
and two, so cemetery and main square,

445
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,812
the locations are in the same spot that was before.

446
00:23:08,232 --> 00:23:11,573
The same goes with number five, number six, and number three.

447
00:23:12,614 --> 00:23:13,834
Those are the same locations, but still,

448
00:23:14,094 --> 00:23:17,175
we figured out how we can make the player have more fun,

449
00:23:17,315 --> 00:23:20,356
more choices, more, you know, optional ways to go there.

450
00:23:21,197 --> 00:23:26,838
So that's why we led us to this kind of more open structure.

451
00:23:30,423 --> 00:23:35,670
So we knew, again, how important for us was the navigation

452
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,373
and that that is the key for us.

453
00:23:37,413 --> 00:23:40,317
Because, OK, we can do very nice, pretty things,

454
00:23:40,357 --> 00:23:41,478
but still we're doing games.

455
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,180
And the games need to be fun.

456
00:23:43,641 --> 00:23:44,562
So we had to create the fun.

457
00:23:44,602 --> 00:23:46,125
And navigation is part of the fun.

458
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:51,847
Also, for the tech part, we knew how controlling visibility for us is important,

459
00:23:52,127 --> 00:23:58,050
so we did a lot of things to be sure that it's going to get optimized well.

460
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:04,732
We never ever drop the feedback down, we always try to incorporate as much things from the feedback as we can

461
00:24:04,872 --> 00:24:07,813
and try to improve the things we're working on right now.

462
00:24:08,394 --> 00:24:13,355
And we were trying to find as much problems and solutions for the problems as early as possible,

463
00:24:13,836 --> 00:24:16,077
even on a blockout stage, on prototyping stage.

464
00:24:17,335 --> 00:24:19,496
So that led us to the final block out.

465
00:24:19,536 --> 00:24:20,556
We're happy about that.

466
00:24:20,616 --> 00:24:23,517
We were thinking, OK, let's do next steps.

467
00:24:24,057 --> 00:24:26,178
And the next step was to actually build the city,

468
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:29,058
actually populate the city with cool, cool art.

469
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:35,980
First step was for us to divide the whole city

470
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,640
into four districts again.

471
00:24:38,321 --> 00:24:40,541
The yellow one, the yellow part, it's Elven Palace.

472
00:24:40,681 --> 00:24:41,882
The red, it's Upper City.

473
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,362
The purple, it's Poor Town, basically.

474
00:24:45,502 --> 00:24:46,803
And Harbor is the green one.

475
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:55,177
The reason for that was that those different districts had different assets,

476
00:24:55,638 --> 00:24:58,040
different characteristics and different uniqueness to it.

477
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:03,665
So it was easier for us to pack the different assets into one group

478
00:25:04,005 --> 00:25:06,167
and separate those on different districts.

479
00:25:06,568 --> 00:25:11,793
And also it was easier for us to separate the work for different artists on different districts.

480
00:25:17,441 --> 00:25:21,344
budgets. Everyone loves budgets, especially us, artists.

481
00:25:22,024 --> 00:25:25,927
So we had the basic numbers from our great team at TechArt.

482
00:25:27,849 --> 00:25:31,812
Those were the numbers we were working with because this presentation, of course,

483
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:36,135
is from an environment artist perspective. So we had 200 megabytes for meshes.

484
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:40,499
Altogether we had 500 megabytes for textures from which...

485
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,821
200 megabytes was it called Resident Textures,

486
00:25:45,122 --> 00:25:46,622
which for instance were proxies.

487
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,464
Because we're doing open world games,

488
00:25:48,744 --> 00:25:52,726
so we have a lot of content like Fireway Village

489
00:25:52,786 --> 00:25:55,728
or Fireway Architecture or all those different woods,

490
00:25:55,828 --> 00:25:58,750
forests, terrain, all those things have to be visible

491
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,831
for the player all the time.

492
00:26:00,331 --> 00:26:02,232
So that cost us a lot also.

493
00:26:02,753 --> 00:26:04,674
And you had the 300 megabytes for the things

494
00:26:04,774 --> 00:26:05,674
we were actually creating.

495
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:07,615
for the content for the CD.

496
00:26:08,196 --> 00:26:12,098
Chunks itself, those are material instances we used,

497
00:26:12,298 --> 00:26:14,539
and we had half a million triangle budget

498
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:16,720
for only environment art.

499
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,521
Those numbers right now are the things

500
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:21,582
that were kind of, for us, like environment artists.

501
00:26:21,982 --> 00:26:24,263
I'm pretty sure TechArt did a tremendous job

502
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:26,665
kind of doing whatever they had to do with those numbers,

503
00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:28,625
but those were the things, those limits,

504
00:26:28,725 --> 00:26:30,206
we were kind of keeping our eye on.

505
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:36,583
So the next question was how we can actually navigate how far

506
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:39,665
we went or how far we can go or where we're at this point

507
00:26:39,705 --> 00:26:41,706
with textures, with memory, with meshes.

508
00:26:42,546 --> 00:26:46,008
And we figured that we're going to find some locations that

509
00:26:46,368 --> 00:26:48,309
are very demanding.

510
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,971
And if those locations are going to get under the limits,

511
00:26:51,671 --> 00:26:53,452
we were thinking, OK, so probably

512
00:26:53,632 --> 00:26:55,053
all those different parts of the game

513
00:26:55,353 --> 00:26:56,834
also going to get optimized enough.

514
00:26:58,055 --> 00:27:00,236
So we picked six.

515
00:27:01,374 --> 00:27:02,555
The fourth one was harbor.

516
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:05,876
It's demanding because we got market square there.

517
00:27:06,196 --> 00:27:08,277
We have all those different decorations there.

518
00:27:08,657 --> 00:27:12,299
And it was packed with content, with NPCs and content.

519
00:27:12,379 --> 00:27:14,579
The same here, lower city, different assets,

520
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:17,681
different interiors, many NPCs, very dense content

521
00:27:17,741 --> 00:27:18,241
on the streets.

522
00:27:19,241 --> 00:27:21,702
Upper city the same, but different architecture

523
00:27:21,722 --> 00:27:22,703
right now, different assets.

524
00:27:24,563 --> 00:27:27,545
Main square, as I said before, very demanding location.

525
00:27:28,645 --> 00:27:29,005
Temple.

526
00:27:29,713 --> 00:27:35,415
Because on the top we've got cemetery, on the bottom we have catacombs, it's all surrounded with houses, with interiors.

527
00:27:36,496 --> 00:27:38,236
Stuff is really dense over there.

528
00:27:39,097 --> 00:27:49,080
And the last one was Mandragora, which was this kind of rich people party place, with view to open to the whole Tucson.

529
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:54,058
So we had this kind of plan how we can see how far we went

530
00:27:54,178 --> 00:27:58,682
or how far we can go, but still we had to be very careful

531
00:27:58,702 --> 00:27:59,703
with how we can manage that.

532
00:28:00,103 --> 00:28:02,064
We still wanted to have sharp textures,

533
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:04,846
we wanted to create things very efficiently,

534
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,508
and we still wanted to create a lot and lots

535
00:28:07,588 --> 00:28:10,410
of visual variety and customization and uniqueness.

536
00:28:12,352 --> 00:28:14,193
So we get reports like that every week,

537
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:17,316
sometimes even twice a week from our art QA guys.

538
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:18,926
And it looked like that.

539
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:21,767
This is one of the reports from the early process

540
00:28:21,807 --> 00:28:23,948
of populating our game.

541
00:28:24,348 --> 00:28:28,010
So we had like this, and that, and that was over limits.

542
00:28:28,731 --> 00:28:30,011
So right now, we know why we call it red,

543
00:28:30,912 --> 00:28:33,813
because everything is red in our limits.

544
00:28:35,294 --> 00:28:37,415
I will give an example why it was so,

545
00:28:37,656 --> 00:28:39,817
because this is just one house we used

546
00:28:39,897 --> 00:28:41,578
in the upper town of Buclear.

547
00:28:42,118 --> 00:28:44,439
Of course, unless you see the concept art in the middle,

548
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:45,820
it's a simple mesh in Maya.

549
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,801
And on the right, you can see the house in the game.

550
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:52,989
And that house looked like that, just the exterior part.

551
00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:55,251
It covers over 12,000 triangles.

552
00:28:56,232 --> 00:28:57,553
It had 51 shanks.

553
00:28:58,293 --> 00:29:00,415
Mesh covered over three megabytes,

554
00:29:00,595 --> 00:29:02,357
and texture was over 14 megabytes.

555
00:29:04,178 --> 00:29:07,661
That house had interior, two floors, bedroom and living

556
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:08,021
room.

557
00:29:08,642 --> 00:29:11,584
And only decoration, I mean only the beds, only the chairs,

558
00:29:11,705 --> 00:29:14,827
only the furniture, only those carpets, all those things,

559
00:29:15,027 --> 00:29:17,049
only cost us only 155,000 triangles.

560
00:29:19,627 --> 00:29:24,109
Over 45 almost megabytes of texture memory,

561
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:29,251
almost 27 megabytes of mesh data and chunks,

562
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:30,131
it was 157.

563
00:29:30,592 --> 00:29:33,653
But on that, we also had walls,

564
00:29:34,433 --> 00:29:35,694
because we had to have walls, right?

565
00:29:36,434 --> 00:29:39,235
Don't need the walls, those cool walls, wooden walls,

566
00:29:39,455 --> 00:29:41,496
cost us over 41,000 triangles,

567
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:43,777
texture data was almost 14 megabytes,

568
00:29:44,118 --> 00:29:47,199
and over 12 megabytes for mesh data.

569
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,829
So just to put the perspective for you guys,

570
00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:54,250
just one house with two floors for the interior

571
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:55,671
looks like that.

572
00:29:58,992 --> 00:30:01,333
I figured it's gonna get hard to create

573
00:30:01,373 --> 00:30:03,254
Booklearn with just only two and a half houses.

574
00:30:05,935 --> 00:30:06,396
Why not?

575
00:30:06,516 --> 00:30:07,196
Let's do it, right?

576
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:11,998
So as you can see, I think that it doesn't

577
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:12,858
need an explanation more.

578
00:30:13,944 --> 00:30:16,545
So what to do? This was the question, what to do right now?

579
00:30:17,305 --> 00:30:20,666
But we were, again, we were very super short with the time,

580
00:30:20,726 --> 00:30:22,667
so it was hard for us to reinvent the wheel.

581
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:24,327
We just tried to make the perfect wheel.

582
00:30:24,808 --> 00:30:27,148
So we used the techniques we used from the Witcher

583
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:29,749
and kind of tweaked it to make it, for us at that point,

584
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:31,490
better and more perfect.

585
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,150
And the solutions for that was basic stuff.

586
00:30:34,531 --> 00:30:37,291
It was streaming, it was lots, and a few technical.

587
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:39,262
Now let's go to the tricks.

588
00:30:40,782 --> 00:30:43,402
The basic setup we did for the meshes in the town

589
00:30:43,663 --> 00:30:47,743
was that when you're over 50 meters away from the house,

590
00:30:48,403 --> 00:30:50,524
we're going to only use the proxy in the memory.

591
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:54,184
When you're between 50 and 20 meters,

592
00:30:55,065 --> 00:30:58,705
you're going to have in our memory the proxy and the LOD1.

593
00:30:59,265 --> 00:31:00,766
But when you're closer than 20 meters,

594
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,646
you're going to have the base mesh, so the most demanding

595
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:05,047
mesh, plus the interiors.

596
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:07,510
This is the basic set up.

597
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,071
We, of course, customized the set up

598
00:31:09,311 --> 00:31:11,312
because the streets were shorter and longer.

599
00:31:11,372 --> 00:31:12,213
So we tweaked that.

600
00:31:12,573 --> 00:31:14,394
But this is more or less the basic one.

601
00:31:16,115 --> 00:31:17,636
Same house, just different paint job.

602
00:31:18,096 --> 00:31:20,978
But you can see how costly was those house.

603
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:24,600
I love these zeros, so this most detailed one.

604
00:31:25,295 --> 00:31:27,657
was almost 30,000 triangles.

605
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,079
LOD was kind of half,

606
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,702
and the proxy itself was kind of less than 5,000 triangles.

607
00:31:34,723 --> 00:31:35,884
I will cover texture later on,

608
00:31:35,904 --> 00:31:38,527
but just to keep in mind that the proxy itself

609
00:31:39,247 --> 00:31:42,230
has the baked custom texture only for the proxy,

610
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,772
and it costs half megabytes.

611
00:31:46,052 --> 00:31:47,413
For the interior, we had two lots.

612
00:31:48,013 --> 00:31:50,874
So the one that's detailed, the detailed wall,

613
00:31:51,254 --> 00:31:55,075
and the other one, the loaded one, was just plain walls.

614
00:31:55,295 --> 00:31:57,576
Because if you could go away from the house,

615
00:31:57,996 --> 00:31:59,176
and some NPC is gonna figure,

616
00:31:59,236 --> 00:32:00,257
okay, I wanna go into that house,

617
00:32:00,857 --> 00:32:04,438
we just didn't want you to see pure space, emptiness.

618
00:32:04,578 --> 00:32:05,998
So the wall discovered that.

619
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,426
And the crash itself was also getting streamed out very, very fast.

620
00:32:12,827 --> 00:32:18,313
So to not to show those different things popping and switching into interiors,

621
00:32:18,573 --> 00:32:21,376
we had to create some kind of, you know,

622
00:32:21,456 --> 00:32:23,839
illusion that the interiors are still there, but it's not.

623
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:27,302
And we used this parallax shader.

624
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:30,583
So this is a simple plan, there's nothing inside

625
00:32:30,603 --> 00:32:32,864
the house right now, but it gives you the illusion

626
00:32:32,904 --> 00:32:34,925
that the interior is there, so you think that,

627
00:32:35,006 --> 00:32:37,167
okay, there's a room there, I probably might go inside.

628
00:32:37,587 --> 00:32:39,509
And you might, but right now it's nothing there.

629
00:32:43,331 --> 00:32:43,671
Bless you.

630
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:48,555
So we had those tricks, we had those solutions,

631
00:32:48,575 --> 00:32:51,517
we had those tools, so are we clear of risks?

632
00:32:51,617 --> 00:32:53,458
Are we just going for vacations right now?

633
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:54,699
Not really.

634
00:32:56,255 --> 00:33:00,119
We also need to hit smooth frame rate for all the hardware.

635
00:33:00,459 --> 00:33:01,400
You're putting the game out.

636
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,423
We still have, we still had and still have,

637
00:33:04,743 --> 00:33:07,085
big long views all around the Tucson,

638
00:33:07,465 --> 00:33:08,246
packed with meshes.

639
00:33:09,127 --> 00:33:10,548
And the scenes were seriously heavy.

640
00:33:11,308 --> 00:33:13,811
Like this one here, you can see we got the town,

641
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:17,274
we got all the different districts below us,

642
00:33:17,694 --> 00:33:19,355
we got the different locations in the back,

643
00:33:19,696 --> 00:33:22,238
on the terrain, on the foliage, on the water.

644
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:23,299
It's heavy.

645
00:33:24,805 --> 00:33:27,206
But we used the same technique we used in the Witcher.

646
00:33:27,446 --> 00:33:29,367
And that was the support from Umbra.

647
00:33:29,647 --> 00:33:30,107
We used it.

648
00:33:30,587 --> 00:33:34,288
And it helps us a lot to get this rendering time lower.

649
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:38,630
And from our point of view, how we prepared the meshes

650
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,551
from Umbra was that if you're going

651
00:33:40,571 --> 00:33:43,752
to go and see the house like that, our famous blue house,

652
00:33:44,453 --> 00:33:46,333
let's just say you're going to see only the top part

653
00:33:46,373 --> 00:33:46,813
of the house.

654
00:33:47,474 --> 00:33:49,334
So the Umbra will see only two meshes right now.

655
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:52,896
And the Umbra will render almost 3,500 triangles.

656
00:33:55,312 --> 00:33:57,613
But if you're going to see the middle level and the top level,

657
00:33:57,633 --> 00:33:59,674
we're going to get more meshes to render,

658
00:34:00,035 --> 00:34:02,236
and the overall triangle count, we're

659
00:34:02,256 --> 00:34:03,917
going to get close to 10,000 right now.

660
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:08,100
And of course, you're going to see the whole mesh is going

661
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,100
to get over 13,000 triangles all together.

662
00:34:12,271 --> 00:34:13,152
But still, it helped us a lot.

663
00:34:13,532 --> 00:34:16,754
And the other cool thing here is that we ended up

664
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:20,216
with cool Lego blocks, different pieces for the house,

665
00:34:20,717 --> 00:34:22,678
that we could build different variations

666
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:27,401
from the same spots, the same blocks, parts, puzzles.

667
00:34:28,242 --> 00:34:31,884
And that gave us the tools to create much more variety

668
00:34:32,124 --> 00:34:34,146
for our houses, having the same meshes.

669
00:34:34,886 --> 00:34:36,047
Was a win-win situation right now.

670
00:34:38,616 --> 00:34:46,481
So we had that feeling that knowing our limits gave us enough feedback to figure out how we can approach

671
00:34:46,561 --> 00:34:50,123
and what kind of things we can do to fit into the limits.

672
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:57,648
We again used the techniques we used before with kind of a twist to fit our needs at this point even more.

673
00:34:59,446 --> 00:35:01,230
Tremendous support from our tech team.

674
00:35:01,812 --> 00:35:03,616
We used Umbra to improve the rendering time.

675
00:35:04,017 --> 00:35:08,347
And with that, we got even more customizable assets for us.

676
00:35:09,781 --> 00:35:10,842
So we had the meshes done, right?

677
00:35:10,982 --> 00:35:12,262
But right now we need to figure out

678
00:35:12,282 --> 00:35:13,923
how we're gonna paint all those meshes

679
00:35:14,043 --> 00:35:15,664
and those big, flat surfaces.

680
00:35:16,344 --> 00:35:19,386
We still wanted to go with twice as dense texel

681
00:35:19,646 --> 00:35:20,606
as it was in the Witcher.

682
00:35:21,167 --> 00:35:24,308
We still wanted to have very unique look

683
00:35:24,348 --> 00:35:25,249
to every single house.

684
00:35:26,049 --> 00:35:30,051
And we had lots and lots of big surfaces to cover.

685
00:35:30,992 --> 00:35:33,093
Just to put it in perspective, this is the same house,

686
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:37,294
just back of it, one wall, all those different floors.

687
00:35:38,015 --> 00:35:40,636
In our engine, 1K texture covers,

688
00:35:40,816 --> 00:35:43,177
texture, not material, texture covers 0.6 megabytes.

689
00:35:44,357 --> 00:35:46,218
And we wanted to go with 1K texture

690
00:35:46,558 --> 00:35:48,099
on every four square meters.

691
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:51,600
So if I would like to create one custom texture

692
00:35:51,661 --> 00:35:54,622
for the wall, I should go with five or six K texture

693
00:35:54,662 --> 00:35:55,482
just for one wall.

694
00:35:55,882 --> 00:35:57,203
So four sides of the same house

695
00:35:57,243 --> 00:35:58,724
would cost me around 72 megabytes of D.

696
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,390
texture memory.

697
00:36:02,231 --> 00:36:04,252
So then again, it's kind of like that.

698
00:36:06,893 --> 00:36:09,635
It's impossible for us to get four houses

699
00:36:10,055 --> 00:36:12,537
and build the whole town with four houses.

700
00:36:13,177 --> 00:36:14,558
So we figured that's impossible for us.

701
00:36:14,598 --> 00:36:15,759
We cannot go with custom textures

702
00:36:15,819 --> 00:36:18,380
and to figure out a way of doing those differently.

703
00:36:20,181 --> 00:36:21,962
And again, we just couldn't afford that,

704
00:36:22,163 --> 00:36:25,244
but still we will not sacrifice our art vision

705
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:28,606
and uniqueness and customize look to every single asset.

706
00:36:29,805 --> 00:36:31,867
So again, we drove to our friends at TechArt,

707
00:36:32,868 --> 00:36:34,889
and we were talking about our needs

708
00:36:34,969 --> 00:36:37,131
and our things, what we want to do.

709
00:36:37,812 --> 00:36:39,993
And we came up, basically they came up

710
00:36:40,013 --> 00:36:41,094
with a really cool solution.

711
00:36:42,435 --> 00:36:43,816
We called this BlanchTrader.

712
00:36:44,257 --> 00:36:45,357
It's of course a vertex trader.

713
00:36:45,998 --> 00:36:50,381
This is a setup for this upper rich town houses.

714
00:36:50,882 --> 00:36:53,744
It's going through the clean plaster,

715
00:36:53,864 --> 00:36:56,406
throughout the bricks to the kind of...

716
00:36:57,064 --> 00:36:59,604
clean plaster bricks, whatever, but it worked perfectly.

717
00:36:59,624 --> 00:37:02,565
Those textures were mixed in between

718
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:03,906
with those black and white masks.

719
00:37:04,686 --> 00:37:08,827
On top of that, we could put the tint over on any color.

720
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:11,048
That's why those textures are so monochromatic

721
00:37:11,088 --> 00:37:14,189
because it was easier for us to put the color over it.

722
00:37:14,629 --> 00:37:17,931
And on top of that, we could put, we call this pattern.

723
00:37:17,971 --> 00:37:20,972
It was kind of a decal of having this final touch

724
00:37:21,032 --> 00:37:22,712
of uniqueness to every single surface.

725
00:37:24,106 --> 00:37:25,286
And it worked, it was really nice.

726
00:37:25,546 --> 00:37:27,727
It worked over the bigger assets and small assets,

727
00:37:28,047 --> 00:37:29,988
of course with different set of textures.

728
00:37:31,088 --> 00:37:33,029
So the first step was, of course, in Max,

729
00:37:33,569 --> 00:37:36,750
we had to paint the mesh as we wanted to,

730
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,691
to make it look cool, unique, and just to be happy with it.

731
00:37:40,212 --> 00:37:42,732
So it's, the things probably know how it works,

732
00:37:42,792 --> 00:37:44,553
but it's enough for the first step.

733
00:37:46,334 --> 00:37:48,414
And after the paint job was done in Max,

734
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,083
we had to grab it into the engine.

735
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:52,444
This is the example I'm gonna use

736
00:37:52,484 --> 00:37:53,865
because this house is super cool.

737
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:55,887
It used all the layers for the material,

738
00:37:56,067 --> 00:37:56,868
all the different tricks.

739
00:37:57,328 --> 00:37:59,670
It's looking cool, kind of damaged, weathered,

740
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,812
but it looks very characteristic,

741
00:38:01,832 --> 00:38:03,233
very unique to the other houses.

742
00:38:06,396 --> 00:38:07,897
And again here.

743
00:38:08,894 --> 00:38:15,760
After the basic painting is done in Max, we had to jump into the engine.

744
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,904
So here we could overlay any surface with any color.

745
00:38:21,024 --> 00:38:24,146
You could go 100% color without textures and it would work.

746
00:38:24,527 --> 00:38:26,668
Of course it wouldn't look good, but still it was possible.

747
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:31,270
And here it's very cool to give it like a very subtle tint

748
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,012
to overall color just to give a base for further tweaking.

749
00:38:35,352 --> 00:38:38,173
Here we got this kind of yellowish weathered color

750
00:38:38,833 --> 00:38:39,633
for the whole house.

751
00:38:41,174 --> 00:38:44,915
And then, okay, and then we can go over the overlay

752
00:38:44,935 --> 00:38:45,436
with dirt.

753
00:38:45,896 --> 00:38:48,557
We could overlay the dirt on every single different layer

754
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,217
of the texture.

755
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,278
So, and of course we could kind of change the UV for it.

756
00:38:54,070 --> 00:39:01,077
So you could make it unique and custom to every single surface with overlay this dirt.

757
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,822
It has to be subtle of course, it's not like this.

758
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:12,087
So I'm going to go probably with 0.2, it gives that very cool unique look to it.

759
00:39:13,248 --> 00:39:16,431
And then we could go and give a tint, color tint.

760
00:39:19,801 --> 00:39:23,023
color tint to the different layers of the materials.

761
00:39:23,264 --> 00:39:25,545
So for instance, like here, we just wanna go with

762
00:39:26,386 --> 00:39:29,628
this yellowish color only on the plaster, not the bricks.

763
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:34,612
So we can figure out which layers are the plaster layer

764
00:39:34,992 --> 00:39:37,795
and don't give a tint to those things beneath it,

765
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,936
those bricks, basically.

766
00:39:40,357 --> 00:39:42,158
And of course, you could go with whatever color you want

767
00:39:42,178 --> 00:39:46,481
to go, so it was actually really fun to paint that.

768
00:39:47,446 --> 00:39:49,909
the model itself in Max and then in our engine.

769
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,151
It was super cool fun to make it look very unique.

770
00:39:52,551 --> 00:39:57,135
So here we're gonna tweak and just paint the plaster

771
00:39:57,536 --> 00:39:59,638
and don't paint the bricks like this.

772
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:03,942
And then also we could play around with contrast

773
00:40:03,982 --> 00:40:06,024
of the mask so that blending between materials

774
00:40:06,044 --> 00:40:07,786
is gonna be more or less seamless

775
00:40:08,486 --> 00:40:12,290
or give it more natural action, you know, scratchy feel.

776
00:40:13,692 --> 00:40:22,158
And the last thing we could do from this basic set up was that we could give it, hold on,

777
00:40:23,499 --> 00:40:31,405
yes, we could give it an AO overlay. It was kind of faking it but it gave us this kind of

778
00:40:31,585 --> 00:40:37,309
extra depth to any object we worked on. So it was really nice to give it some subtle AO for

779
00:40:37,329 --> 00:40:38,870
those things that were standing out.

780
00:40:41,361 --> 00:40:45,482
So this was this very basic setup from the max part

781
00:40:45,562 --> 00:40:48,183
to the in-engine meshes.

782
00:40:48,723 --> 00:40:50,504
And as you can see, those houses here,

783
00:40:50,984 --> 00:40:54,765
they share the same materials, but they look very differently.

784
00:40:55,145 --> 00:40:57,906
They got different decals, different patterns,

785
00:40:58,086 --> 00:41:00,867
different colors, but that is all in the shader.

786
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:02,588
Those decals are put on top of it,

787
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:05,769
but still we could get different variations,

788
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:07,850
different unique look and custom look

789
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,270
using the seven textures.

790
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:14,135
For us it was the time saver and basically product saver.

791
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:19,223
So again, knowing our limits gave us the tools

792
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,104
and things that we need to figure out

793
00:41:21,225 --> 00:41:23,907
how we want to do things from the artistic point of view

794
00:41:24,267 --> 00:41:25,748
and being between the limits.

795
00:41:26,849 --> 00:41:28,990
And the solution was this blend shader

796
00:41:29,631 --> 00:41:30,531
we got from TechArt.

797
00:41:30,832 --> 00:41:32,953
We did it not and didn't want to

798
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:34,855
sacrifice the art vision we had.

799
00:41:35,395 --> 00:41:38,257
And also we have even more customized look

800
00:41:38,277 --> 00:41:41,359
for the assets within this pipeline of ours.

801
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,022
So we had the meshes done, we had the layout done,

802
00:41:44,062 --> 00:41:45,304
we had the texture work done,

803
00:41:45,784 --> 00:41:47,887
and now we had to figure out how we can do,

804
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:52,733
in a very fast time, the open world part of our game.

805
00:41:53,894 --> 00:41:57,359
And this time, not the tech was our enemy, but the time.

806
00:41:59,188 --> 00:42:03,792
In our studio, we are 100% handmade feel ready.

807
00:42:03,832 --> 00:42:05,793
We're doing everything to make it feel unique,

808
00:42:05,874 --> 00:42:07,435
custom, and handmade.

809
00:42:08,336 --> 00:42:09,657
And we did that with The Witcher.

810
00:42:10,257 --> 00:42:11,699
And we didn't want to sacrifice that.

811
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:13,680
But still, we knew how hard it is

812
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,363
and how time-consuming it is to do everything by hand

813
00:42:16,563 --> 00:42:17,644
and everything unique.

814
00:42:18,404 --> 00:42:22,928
So we wanted to have this golden pipeline

815
00:42:23,389 --> 00:42:24,910
very fast and handmade.

816
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:27,918
And we need to figure out how we can speed up our plan

817
00:42:27,938 --> 00:42:28,879
play we had with the Witcher.

818
00:42:29,939 --> 00:42:33,782
And the basic solution was the entity system

819
00:42:33,822 --> 00:42:35,003
we had in our engine.

820
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:41,729
So the entities are like a set of groups of different assets

821
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:43,470
that some artist is doing.

822
00:42:44,491 --> 00:42:47,774
And that is very easy to customize, change, swap,

823
00:42:47,914 --> 00:42:49,275
and do whatever you want to do with it.

824
00:42:49,815 --> 00:42:52,377
For instance, here, I hope you're going to see something.

825
00:42:52,397 --> 00:42:52,878
It's very dark.

826
00:42:54,764 --> 00:43:00,528
those green tinted things are the parts of the decoration for this house. Here you're going to

827
00:43:00,568 --> 00:43:08,434
see it even better. So some artists spent probably some time, probably a few days doing that but the

828
00:43:08,514 --> 00:43:15,500
deco team, we call it the deco team, they did a tremendous job with it. Very cool job. So they

829
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,881
decorate this house, they make an entity.

830
00:43:18,642 --> 00:43:22,684
So it was easy to make this, grab this, and change it.

831
00:43:22,744 --> 00:43:25,546
Like here, for instance, we have this table with food.

832
00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:28,248
So if someone's going to want to have different variation

833
00:43:28,288 --> 00:43:30,669
of the table with food, you don't need to grab the same,

834
00:43:30,689 --> 00:43:32,590
you don't need to grab it from scratch.

835
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,612
You can take it, copy it, and just make some tweaks,

836
00:43:35,812 --> 00:43:37,853
change it to make it look unique and different,

837
00:43:38,374 --> 00:43:39,794
but in a much, much faster time.

838
00:43:40,635 --> 00:43:41,676
Like for instance, here again,

839
00:43:41,696 --> 00:43:44,837
we get the merchant stands for harbor part.

840
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:49,650
I hope you can see how dense it is and with detail,

841
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:50,510
how detailed it is.

842
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:53,851
Someone actually spends a lot of time doing that.

843
00:43:54,691 --> 00:43:57,633
But like me, someone who needs to actually later on

844
00:43:57,673 --> 00:43:58,973
decorate the whole environment

845
00:43:59,013 --> 00:44:00,654
with different decoration things,

846
00:44:01,314 --> 00:44:04,395
it would take me like probably months doing a market query

847
00:44:04,755 --> 00:44:06,116
and putting all the different fishes,

848
00:44:06,136 --> 00:44:08,997
you know, rolls on vegetables in the basket.

849
00:44:09,577 --> 00:44:11,478
So that gave us the opportunity.

850
00:44:12,118 --> 00:44:15,021
different team, deco team, that did a great job with it,

851
00:44:15,541 --> 00:44:16,962
provide us with those deco sets,

852
00:44:17,563 --> 00:44:20,025
and I could just drop and drop those onto the level

853
00:44:20,185 --> 00:44:22,467
and just figure out how I can create the environment,

854
00:44:22,507 --> 00:44:25,089
the layout, and things that the player's gonna explore.

855
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:29,033
I didn't need to spend days, weeks,

856
00:44:29,813 --> 00:44:32,135
on putting the fishes on the table,

857
00:44:32,916 --> 00:44:34,918
which is a cool job, but I didn't have time for that.

858
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:40,764
So that gave us this kind of upper hand for the creation

859
00:44:41,184 --> 00:44:42,965
of the whole environment here.

860
00:44:43,426 --> 00:44:46,388
I actually spent like three minutes doing the market square

861
00:44:46,448 --> 00:44:48,250
here, so it looked like that.

862
00:44:51,973 --> 00:44:54,515
So for the player, you can see it's very dense in content,

863
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:58,158
very dense in detail, and really looking cool handmade quality.

864
00:44:58,478 --> 00:45:00,520
But for me, it was actually three minutes to finish this

865
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:00,820
out.

866
00:45:03,262 --> 00:45:05,184
I don't know how long it would take me to, you know.

867
00:45:05,687 --> 00:45:07,276
play with those different small details.

868
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:15,411
So yes, we did it.

869
00:45:16,011 --> 00:45:18,453
We made it faster.

870
00:45:18,473 --> 00:45:21,255
It was a very smart decision because we made it faster,

871
00:45:21,295 --> 00:45:24,377
but we still kept this handmade quality to it.

872
00:45:25,078 --> 00:45:27,559
And it was kind of this automatic solution,

873
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,182
but still we didn't want to sacrifice the uniqueness to it.

874
00:45:31,742 --> 00:45:34,264
And it actually helped us to decorate the locations

875
00:45:34,584 --> 00:45:37,126
much, much faster than it would to create

876
00:45:37,206 --> 00:45:39,468
every single spot by hand from the scratch.

877
00:45:41,779 --> 00:45:45,302
So just to sum this up, we started with pre-production,

878
00:45:45,683 --> 00:45:48,726
and that gave us the importance of navigation.

879
00:45:48,766 --> 00:45:52,689
We knew how important it is to get the layout done properly

880
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:54,891
to support the navigation for the player,

881
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:57,394
just to give them fun rather than frustration.

882
00:45:57,974 --> 00:46:00,296
And we did blockouts, and we tweaked the blockout

883
00:46:00,436 --> 00:46:02,458
as long as we figured that the blockout was

884
00:46:02,478 --> 00:46:03,599
going to work pretty nicely.

885
00:46:04,981 --> 00:46:12,588
At the beginning, we were able to identify and solve technical problems even on the prototyping stage.

886
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:20,355
And we were iterating as long as we figured that the things we did right now are good enough.

887
00:46:22,357 --> 00:46:26,561
Thanks to knowing our limits, we knew that we need to figure out a way to do...

888
00:46:28,087 --> 00:46:29,868
art as we wanted to do.

889
00:46:30,028 --> 00:46:31,868
So we didn't want to sacrifice the art vision,

890
00:46:31,908 --> 00:46:34,729
but still we had to maintain within the limits

891
00:46:34,749 --> 00:46:35,769
we were having.

892
00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:37,330
We used those things that we knew,

893
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:40,750
like streaming, like LODs, like the tool Umbra,

894
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,951
and upon that we improved those things

895
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:45,452
to fit our needs even more.

896
00:46:46,312 --> 00:46:47,432
And we had our blend shader,

897
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:50,073
which was the direct solution to the texture needs.

898
00:46:50,896 --> 00:46:56,323
for Buclair and we also were able to very easily

899
00:46:57,184 --> 00:46:58,586
improve our decoration pipeline

900
00:46:58,606 --> 00:46:59,928
with the entities and deco sets.

901
00:47:01,217 --> 00:47:03,758
We achieved actually still long vistas over Tucson.

902
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,439
Even though we closed the streets in town,

903
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,561
still we have a lot, a lot of open spaces

904
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:12,902
and lots of views throughout the whole Tucson.

905
00:47:13,783 --> 00:47:15,703
We have the unique character of assets,

906
00:47:15,803 --> 00:47:17,184
every district look different,

907
00:47:17,724 --> 00:47:21,666
and yet it was optimized enough to hit the limits we had.

908
00:47:22,446 --> 00:47:22,606
So.

909
00:47:23,768 --> 00:47:25,589
Also, we improved the textual density.

910
00:47:25,889 --> 00:47:29,530
It's actually twice as dense as it was in The Witcher 3.

911
00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:34,011
We actually have much more dense crowd system in our game

912
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,191
than there was in Novigrad.

913
00:47:36,732 --> 00:47:41,273
And there is tons and tons of content throughout the streets.

914
00:47:42,053 --> 00:47:45,374
And also, we were able to make it the fast education

915
00:47:45,414 --> 00:47:46,854
pipeline throughout the whole world.

916
00:47:48,288 --> 00:47:50,970
So the takeaways from you guys from this talk, I would say,

917
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:53,671
I hope that some of those techniques or the things

918
00:47:53,691 --> 00:47:57,414
I talked about will also improve your pipelines

919
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:59,335
or your techniques or things that you're gonna do.

920
00:47:59,915 --> 00:48:03,077
But my personal takeaway would be that

921
00:48:03,778 --> 00:48:05,179
don't be afraid of iterating.

922
00:48:05,379 --> 00:48:07,920
I know how much it sometimes gets frustrating

923
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,362
to be doing the same, those things the same,

924
00:48:10,382 --> 00:48:11,283
the same all over again.

925
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:14,004
But in our case, every iteration pass,

926
00:48:15,062 --> 00:48:18,386
took us further to the better quality we did actually.

927
00:48:19,267 --> 00:48:25,393
We never think that the first kind of trial error

928
00:48:25,654 --> 00:48:27,596
is going to be the best one, so don't be afraid of that.

929
00:48:27,896 --> 00:48:29,958
And also, to put out the game so fast,

930
00:48:30,539 --> 00:48:32,781
we had to have really good communication

931
00:48:32,802 --> 00:48:36,666
between the teams, and I cannot stress enough how.

932
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,761
team work and communication between teams is important

933
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:45,782
to get things done efficiently and fast.

934
00:48:47,683 --> 00:48:49,723
So, if there are some questions, this is the time right now.

935
00:48:49,743 --> 00:48:52,324
Thank you.

936
00:48:52,364 --> 00:48:52,624
Thank you.

937
00:48:52,644 --> 00:48:59,185
Thank you.

938
00:48:59,225 --> 00:48:59,445
Thank you.

939
00:48:59,465 --> 00:48:59,665
Thank you.

940
00:48:59,685 --> 00:49:03,806
Thank you.

941
00:49:03,826 --> 00:49:04,266
Thank you.

942
00:49:04,286 --> 00:49:04,666
Thank you.

943
00:49:04,686 --> 00:49:05,067
Thank you so much.

944
00:49:05,087 --> 00:49:05,287
Thank you.

945
00:49:05,626 --> 00:49:09,248
more details on your LOD creation pipeline?

946
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:12,871
Okay, so the question was,

947
00:49:13,391 --> 00:49:15,712
what was our LOD creation pipeline, right?

948
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:20,035
Okay, so it was mixed.

949
00:49:20,636 --> 00:49:22,877
There are situations where we had to go

950
00:49:22,917 --> 00:49:24,818
with doing the LODs by hand

951
00:49:24,898 --> 00:49:26,419
because it has to look really cool,

952
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:27,860
but we also use Simplygon.

953
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:32,081
and simplygon helped us to also make the LODs faster,

954
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:36,144
but there were cases where we had to go with handmade work

955
00:49:36,204 --> 00:49:38,865
with the LODs just to make it really look nice.

956
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:40,766
Is it okay for the answer?

957
00:49:41,507 --> 00:49:43,748
Thank you.

958
00:49:44,288 --> 00:49:44,488
Hi.

959
00:49:44,508 --> 00:49:44,548
Hi.

960
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:48,011
I'm new to environment modeling,

961
00:49:48,271 --> 00:49:51,533
and earlier you had mentioned you were from Poland?

962
00:49:51,853 --> 00:49:52,353
Yes, I am.

963
00:49:52,953 --> 00:49:54,915
With a Polish last name?

964
00:49:55,355 --> 00:49:55,535
Yes.

965
00:49:57,362 --> 00:49:59,944
Okay, okay, yeah, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

966
00:50:00,985 --> 00:50:03,107
Kaspar Nipokoltsiki.

967
00:50:03,547 --> 00:50:05,609
It's close enough, but not there yet.

968
00:50:07,551 --> 00:50:08,452
But thank you for trying.

969
00:50:08,472 --> 00:50:09,533
Okay.

970
00:50:09,773 --> 00:50:10,113
Thank you.

971
00:50:14,698 --> 00:50:15,278
Hi, so.

972
00:50:15,298 --> 00:50:16,139
Hi.

973
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,641
Obviously, while working through this,

974
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:20,223
you found a lot of different workarounds

975
00:50:20,403 --> 00:50:22,004
for the problems you guys encountered,

976
00:50:22,044 --> 00:50:22,565
but I'm sure.

977
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:27,008
No vision is always 100% complete at the end,

978
00:50:27,148 --> 00:50:30,631
and especially with the time crunch at the end,

979
00:50:30,691 --> 00:50:32,993
I imagine there were still plenty of sacrifices

980
00:50:33,053 --> 00:50:35,175
that you made, so I was curious,

981
00:50:35,695 --> 00:50:39,638
what are the big tips you have on dealing with that

982
00:50:39,698 --> 00:50:42,040
as a team and keeping morale high

983
00:50:42,601 --> 00:50:44,902
when clearly everyone's doing the best that they can,

984
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:47,304
both with the technology and the art vision,

985
00:50:48,065 --> 00:50:49,526
and there's some things that,

986
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:51,428
no matter how much you would like to hold onto.

987
00:50:52,088 --> 00:50:53,388
you can never quite get across?

988
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:57,329
Well, first of all, I think that as in every artist,

989
00:50:57,509 --> 00:50:59,890
there is always not enough time to do the things

990
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:02,090
you want to do, as long as I want to just make it better

991
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:02,790
and better and better.

992
00:51:04,031 --> 00:51:06,511
The first reason is to, the first kind of thing

993
00:51:06,611 --> 00:51:08,472
is to say stop, it's good enough.

994
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:11,492
I know it's super hard, but it has to be done like that.

995
00:51:11,932 --> 00:51:14,533
It's never going to be for you good enough.

996
00:51:15,013 --> 00:51:17,634
As far as it goes, as you asked about the morals

997
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:18,894
in our team, you know,

998
00:51:20,901 --> 00:51:23,783
We got the hype high after the Witcher 3 was released.

999
00:51:23,843 --> 00:51:26,685
We knew how the game is good and how you guys love it.

1000
00:51:26,705 --> 00:51:27,546
Thank you so much for that.

1001
00:51:28,106 --> 00:51:31,589
So we knew that it has to be the quality game.

1002
00:51:31,629 --> 00:51:33,970
So I think that most of us had it in the head

1003
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:35,351
that we have to deliver.

1004
00:51:35,912 --> 00:51:38,373
So I think that we're trying to keep each other

1005
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:42,036
in a friendly hug with not getting down.

1006
00:51:42,076 --> 00:51:44,598
But still, it was hard work, but we knew that.

1007
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:46,671
it's going to pay off basically.

1008
00:51:47,232 --> 00:51:50,615
So I don't know if that answers the question actually,

1009
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,356
but it does?

1010
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:53,737
OK, thank you so much.

1011
00:51:53,997 --> 00:51:54,478
Thank you.

1012
00:51:54,798 --> 00:51:55,158
Thank you.

1013
00:52:00,489 --> 00:52:04,430
Hi, I'm a huge fan, so I thought I would say that.

1014
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:08,772
I'm a huge fan of your very first one, so I thought I would say that.

1015
00:52:09,332 --> 00:52:12,473
Also, I work at Eidos and I'm a level designer, and I was wondering

1016
00:52:13,053 --> 00:52:17,934
during the blockout phase, is it the artist driven only or do you work with level designers?

1017
00:52:19,675 --> 00:52:20,435
That's my first question.

1018
00:52:22,884 --> 00:52:26,007
How do you keep level designers from busting the budget as well by adding their stuff?

1019
00:52:26,387 --> 00:52:28,329
Do you have any process for that? Because I know I did.

1020
00:52:28,889 --> 00:52:33,774
Okay, so the first question was, did the level design was done by artists or designers, right?

1021
00:52:34,254 --> 00:52:41,040
Or is it a collaboration or does the level designer have a big impact on the layout and the landmarks and basically the look of the city?

1022
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,802
Or is it artist driven mostly or a collaboration?

1023
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:49,183
During this project, level design team was part of,

1024
00:52:49,203 --> 00:52:52,467
we call this localization team, so, location team, sorry.

1025
00:52:52,507 --> 00:52:55,711
So it was like artists and designers sitting in one room

1026
00:52:55,751 --> 00:52:56,632
doing the environment.

1027
00:52:57,033 --> 00:52:59,395
So some of the work was done by artists

1028
00:52:59,856 --> 00:53:02,539
and kind of guided by level designers.

1029
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:09,902
So it looked like that, but we all understood how important it is to get the layout done and the navigation to work.

1030
00:53:10,182 --> 00:53:19,066
So it was kind of cooperation between the teams of designers and level designers and basically also environment artists.

1031
00:53:20,658 --> 00:53:23,480
And the tips on how to not break things down.

1032
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:24,320
I don't know.

1033
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:29,664
I think it's just common sense or just the experience

1034
00:53:29,744 --> 00:53:30,445
of the things you do.

1035
00:53:30,545 --> 00:53:33,727
I know we had tons of situations that something was broken down

1036
00:53:33,747 --> 00:53:34,948
because someone did something.

1037
00:53:35,308 --> 00:53:35,788
It's normal.

1038
00:53:36,109 --> 00:53:37,630
But still, we're trying to figure out

1039
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:40,111
how not to do it even more or not

1040
00:53:40,131 --> 00:53:41,232
to repeat the situation like that.

1041
00:53:41,612 --> 00:53:43,954
But I don't have a golden rule for doing that.

1042
00:53:44,975 --> 00:53:50,439
I know that sometimes in my studio they wanted to prevent level designers from adding hard stuff,

1043
00:53:50,479 --> 00:53:52,360
but it was never done because it's too hard.

1044
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,521
We add NPCs to NPCs that can be...

1045
00:53:54,581 --> 00:53:55,262
Yes, yes.

1046
00:53:55,862 --> 00:54:01,026
Also I have a couple of Polish friends at my studio, so maybe I can pronounce your name right?

1047
00:54:01,246 --> 00:54:01,426
Sure.

1048
00:54:01,666 --> 00:54:01,987
Not sure.

1049
00:54:02,747 --> 00:54:04,949
I have a Casper at my studio actually, but this is easy.

1050
00:54:04,969 --> 00:54:07,370
Oh, this is hard.

1051
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:09,372
Niepokorczykowski?

1052
00:54:10,112 --> 00:54:11,453
Close. Close.

1053
00:54:12,295 --> 00:54:13,496
But thank you, thank you for trying.

1054
00:54:13,576 --> 00:54:14,097
Thank you so much.

1055
00:54:14,177 --> 00:54:14,938
Thank you for talking to us.

1056
00:54:14,998 --> 00:54:15,298
Thank you.

1057
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:15,358
Hi.

1058
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:17,680
Hi.

1059
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,121
I actually didn't have a question,

1060
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:20,582
just wanted to say the game came out amazing.

1061
00:54:20,602 --> 00:54:21,363
So, thank you.

1062
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,584
Oh, thank you so much.

1063
00:54:22,604 --> 00:54:22,884
Thank you.

1064
00:54:22,924 --> 00:54:23,144
Thank you.

1065
00:54:23,164 --> 00:54:23,384
Thank you.

1066
00:54:23,404 --> 00:54:23,745
Thank you.

1067
00:54:23,765 --> 00:54:30,690
Thank you.

1068
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:30,970
Thank you.

1069
00:54:30,991 --> 00:54:31,191
Thank you.

1070
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:31,551
Thank you.

1071
00:54:31,571 --> 00:54:31,751
Thank you.

1072
00:54:31,771 --> 00:54:33,112
Again guys, thank you so much for having my first

1073
00:54:33,132 --> 00:54:35,494
DDC this much fun and I hope you enjoyed the talk.

1074
00:54:35,514 --> 00:54:36,015
Thank you so much.
