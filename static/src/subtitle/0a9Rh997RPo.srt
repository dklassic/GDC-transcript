1
00:00:03,672 --> 00:00:05,454
All right, so good morning everybody,

2
00:00:05,494 --> 00:00:06,955
and thank you very much for joining me

3
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:09,236
on the talk about Hitman Go.

4
00:00:10,017 --> 00:00:11,278
At this point I would like to remind you

5
00:00:11,338 --> 00:00:13,559
to turn your cell phones on silent mode,

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,641
and also please don't forget to fill out

7
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:17,402
the speaker evaluation at the end

8
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:21,545
to tell GDC how awesome or how bad this talk was, I guess.

9
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,768
So this talk is gonna be a postmortem

10
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:26,789
on the game Hitman Go, but at the same time

11
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:29,331
I'm gonna try and document the creative process

12
00:00:29,371 --> 00:00:31,893
a little bit that went into the making of this game.

13
00:00:33,856 --> 00:00:35,737
A little bit of an introduction about myself.

14
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:38,678
I'm Daniel, I'm a game director with Square Enix Montreal.

15
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,419
Before that I used to work as a designer

16
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,779
for both Square and EA.

17
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:46,280
And at the same time I'm kind of an independent developer

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,701
on the side in my spare time.

19
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:51,562
I ship these three games by myself.

20
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:53,502
They're iOS games if you want to check them out.

21
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:56,103
And so to tell the story about Hitman Go,

22
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:57,544
I think we have to look at three things.

23
00:00:57,704 --> 00:00:59,404
We have to look at the circumstances

24
00:00:59,945 --> 00:01:01,605
that allowed this project to happen.

25
00:01:02,793 --> 00:01:05,895
We have to look at the idea that initially started off

26
00:01:05,915 --> 00:01:08,798
the project, and we have to look at a process that refined

27
00:01:08,838 --> 00:01:10,840
this idea into the game that is now

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,261
downloadable on the App Store.

29
00:01:14,022 --> 00:01:15,884
And to be honest with you, the circumstances,

30
00:01:15,924 --> 00:01:18,086
this is not really the story that I can tell.

31
00:01:18,106 --> 00:01:20,648
This is the story of management, I guess,

32
00:01:20,668 --> 00:01:23,090
of studio management that allowed this project to happen.

33
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,771
And I was not part of that at that point.

34
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:27,954
But I still want to give you a little bit of an introduction,

35
00:01:27,974 --> 00:01:30,076
a little bit of an overview to give you

36
00:01:30,196 --> 00:01:31,457
the necessary information.

37
00:01:32,182 --> 00:01:34,063
And so the story starts here with Square Enix.

38
00:01:34,743 --> 00:01:37,404
In 2012, the summer, the winter of 2011, 2012,

39
00:01:37,845 --> 00:01:42,727
Square Enix decided to start a new studio in Montreal,

40
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:45,009
and someone had this brilliant idea to turn up,

41
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:47,950
side down, the E from the Square Enix logo,

42
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,071
and make an M out of it.

43
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:51,152
I always thought that was pretty brilliant.

44
00:01:52,074 --> 00:01:53,135
And so it was the winter of 2011, 2012,

45
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:58,260
and there was a new studio to be started.

46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,903
And for that, three people from IO Interactive,

47
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:05,127
Mez, Karsten, and Rasmus, who used to work on Hitman games

48
00:02:05,287 --> 00:02:07,108
and who had also worked on Kane and Lynch.

49
00:02:07,949 --> 00:02:11,091
They relocated to Montreal to start this new studio

50
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:13,113
and hire people.

51
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,974
And I was lucky enough to be one of the first hires

52
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:18,436
and within a year or so, I guess,

53
00:02:18,476 --> 00:02:19,957
we had grown to around 40 people.

54
00:02:20,798 --> 00:02:22,779
Yeah, you can see this is cold Montreal in the winter,

55
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:23,539
that's what it looks like.

56
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,022
And so our mandate was to make a AAA Hitman game

57
00:02:27,082 --> 00:02:28,643
for consoles, this was in 2012,

58
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:32,445
so this was still when current generation consoles

59
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:34,947
weren't announced, so this was a very exciting moment.

60
00:02:35,227 --> 00:02:36,668
I was working on this as a designer.

61
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,472
But as you know, plans, they don't always turn out

62
00:02:40,692 --> 00:02:41,693
as you expect them to.

63
00:02:42,174 --> 00:02:44,897
And so after about a year of development of this game,

64
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:46,258
our project was canceled.

65
00:02:47,259 --> 00:02:50,743
And furthermore, Square Enix decided to turn our studio

66
00:02:51,163 --> 00:02:52,464
from a AAA development studio

67
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,086
into a mobile game development studio.

68
00:02:55,084 --> 00:02:57,666
And as you might expect, this is quite a drastic change

69
00:02:57,726 --> 00:02:59,747
and this kind of shakes up things quite a bit.

70
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:02,329
But I'm pretty happy to say that management

71
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:04,290
did a very good job at kind of transitioning

72
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,471
from AAA into the mobile space.

73
00:03:08,112 --> 00:03:09,834
There was a lot of changes, as you might expect.

74
00:03:10,254 --> 00:03:11,375
Some people lost their jobs.

75
00:03:12,195 --> 00:03:13,496
A lot of them actually just left

76
00:03:14,056 --> 00:03:15,517
because they didn't want to make mobile games.

77
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:17,999
But at the same time, again, I think this transition

78
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:19,820
was as smooth as you can possibly make it

79
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,941
with these circumstances.

80
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:23,843
At the same time, I think this was a pretty exciting moment

81
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,905
for everybody because getting to start working

82
00:03:25,965 --> 00:03:27,986
on something new is always exciting

83
00:03:28,046 --> 00:03:30,328
and management realized that and they started

84
00:03:30,368 --> 00:03:32,310
what they called an incubation moment.

85
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,432
So they allowed everybody in the team,

86
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:36,693
everybody in the studio to come up with ideas

87
00:03:36,814 --> 00:03:39,856
for mobile games within the Square Enix brands.

88
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:41,898
And we started off with Hitman.

89
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:43,679
And they called this the incubation

90
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,501
and basically everybody could participate

91
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:46,241
and make their own games.

92
00:03:48,964 --> 00:03:52,025
And so the mandate was to come up with an idea

93
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:53,085
for a mobile Hitman game.

94
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,326
Really, this was the top level kind of idea.

95
00:03:55,346 --> 00:03:57,767
And there was not many constraints around it, right?

96
00:03:57,787 --> 00:04:00,388
So we were almost giving carte blanche on this one.

97
00:04:00,428 --> 00:04:02,228
We could come up with our own ideas to whatever

98
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:07,070
we thought was good to make this game.

99
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,071
As I said before, not many constraints

100
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:12,011
other than it has to be mobile

101
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,192
and it has to be a Hitman game.

102
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:16,193
And as you might expect in these kind of situations,

103
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:18,758
we're always kind of inclined to think outside the box

104
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,300
and come up with crazy things

105
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,985
and be really creative.

106
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:29,065
But at the same time, I have to say that I think there was a sense of false optimism amongst us in that studio,

107
00:04:29,105 --> 00:04:33,469
even though we were very excited about making and tackling this new platform,

108
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:38,153
we believed that we were the pros, right? There were around 40 people of AAA developers.

109
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:44,038
We thought we knew it all, and that mobile was some sort of thumbed-down version of what we were doing,

110
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:46,880
and this could not be very hard.

111
00:04:47,261 --> 00:04:51,204
And so we thought we're going to be shipping a game within six months of the initial pitch.

112
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:53,886
And so incubation began.

113
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:58,008
And I guess my experience as an independent developer

114
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,249
also brought me to this point.

115
00:05:00,589 --> 00:05:03,771
I really like to work with strong constraints on projects.

116
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,232
I find it very hard to start off

117
00:05:05,252 --> 00:05:06,632
with a blank piece of paper.

118
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:08,173
And so I was looking for constraints.

119
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:11,775
And again, I think independent game suit us very well.

120
00:05:11,795 --> 00:05:12,796
They're very aware of.

121
00:05:13,616 --> 00:05:15,277
the kind of limitations that they have,

122
00:05:16,078 --> 00:05:18,960
be it resources or creative constraints.

123
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:21,162
And I think one great example for that

124
00:05:21,582 --> 00:05:24,845
is the game jams, where a lot of games

125
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:27,086
are actually created out of one single theme

126
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:28,387
or constraint by themselves.

127
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:31,008
But these constraints can be very arbitrary, right?

128
00:05:31,048 --> 00:05:35,370
We would not want to make a Hitman game based on the color blue, for example, right?

129
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,131
This could be a game jam thing, but for Hitman it wouldn't make that much sense.

130
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:43,353
And so, I guess I was looking for more meaningful constraints and constraints that were related to the mandate.

131
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,062
And so in research for this talk and kind of trying to see

132
00:05:47,122 --> 00:05:48,843
if this is something that's also applied outside

133
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:51,465
of video games, I came across a very interesting quote

134
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:55,687
by Charles Eames, who was, as most of you know,

135
00:05:56,408 --> 00:05:59,310
one of the very most important industrial designers

136
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,270
of the 20th century.

137
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,613
Together with his wife, Ray, they were probably best known

138
00:06:04,793 --> 00:06:08,235
for a series of furniture that has become truly iconic today.

139
00:06:08,816 --> 00:06:09,676
And so Charles Eames.

140
00:06:10,577 --> 00:06:14,138
In 1972, when asked about, I think it was a Q&A or an interview,

141
00:06:14,558 --> 00:06:18,619
when asked about if there's constraints to the design process, he says,

142
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:21,300
design depends largely on constraints.

143
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,220
And so this was in 1972.

144
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,522
Please note how I skillfully constrained Mr. Eames' right eye in the letter P there.

145
00:06:30,102 --> 00:06:31,063
That's pretty meta.

146
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:33,244
So he says, design depends largely on constraints.

147
00:06:33,304 --> 00:06:35,985
And furthermore, here's one of the few effective keys

148
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:38,286
to the design problem, the ability of the designer

149
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:40,487
to recognize as many of the constraints as possible,

150
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:42,488
his willingness and enthusiasm for working

151
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:45,110
with these constraints, the constraints of price,

152
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,072
of size, of strength, balance, of surface, of time, et cetera.

153
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:52,233
And then he says, each problem has its own peculiar list.

154
00:06:53,135 --> 00:06:54,077
And I thought that was pretty great,

155
00:06:54,117 --> 00:06:56,341
because even though I didn't know about this at the time,

156
00:06:56,401 --> 00:06:59,046
us working on the Hitman mobile games,

157
00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:01,350
I thought this was pretty close to the actual mindset

158
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:02,672
that we were in at the time.

159
00:07:03,452 --> 00:07:06,074
And so again, he talks about price, size, strength,

160
00:07:06,154 --> 00:07:07,935
surface, balance, time, et cetera.

161
00:07:07,955 --> 00:07:11,218
And we can imagine him talking about furniture

162
00:07:11,238 --> 00:07:15,021
or industrial design, and maybe even about this chair here,

163
00:07:15,742 --> 00:07:19,085
dining chair that's beautiful, beautiful furniture.

164
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:22,327
But the question is, is this really that far away?

165
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:24,549
Is this really that different, making a chair,

166
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:27,432
considering all these constraints from making a game,

167
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:31,475
or in our case, making a Hitman game on mobile platforms?

168
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:35,080
And obviously, as indicated by Charles Eames,

169
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,503
a lot of these constraints depend really on the product that you make.

170
00:07:37,543 --> 00:07:41,028
And I think, in this case, size, strength, balance and surface,

171
00:07:41,048 --> 00:07:43,311
all these kind of material properties that don't really make sense

172
00:07:43,351 --> 00:07:44,293
when we're talking about games.

173
00:07:45,417 --> 00:07:47,938
we can substitute them, we can come up with other things.

174
00:07:47,978 --> 00:07:50,480
And I think price and time, I think we can keep them.

175
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,441
Maybe like consumer facing things,

176
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:54,202
such as how much is the game going to cost?

177
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,543
How long is the game going to be playable?

178
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:57,784
Like what's the playtime of the game?

179
00:07:58,284 --> 00:08:00,746
But then more importantly, we can, using this model,

180
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:02,067
we can add different constraints.

181
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:02,627
We can add.

182
00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:05,752
probably the most important constraint is the brand, right?

183
00:08:05,812 --> 00:08:08,094
We're working with a brand that is very established,

184
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:10,097
that has gone through many iterations

185
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,000
that have come out in different platforms before,

186
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:15,423
and a genre that comes attached to it.

187
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:19,141
A very important constraint, obviously, the platform

188
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:21,343
that we're gonna make a mobile game after all.

189
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:24,326
An audience that has expectations

190
00:08:24,406 --> 00:08:25,347
towards what we're building.

191
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:28,129
And production constraints, very important.

192
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:30,331
We were a studio of AAA developers

193
00:08:30,772 --> 00:08:32,353
ready to ship the game within six months.

194
00:08:33,474 --> 00:08:35,396
And obviously other things such as business models.

195
00:08:35,436 --> 00:08:37,758
So I guess this list can really go on and on,

196
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:39,139
but this is kind of just laying out

197
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:41,802
the key important things that you wanna consider.

198
00:08:42,707 --> 00:08:45,109
And so I guess to illustrate this idea a little bit better,

199
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,791
we can take this chair and instead of having

200
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:50,213
this beautiful DCW chair here,

201
00:08:50,254 --> 00:08:52,135
we can come up and think about different chairs

202
00:08:52,155 --> 00:08:53,496
that don't really do that this well.

203
00:08:53,536 --> 00:08:54,877
And so we can think about a chair

204
00:08:55,358 --> 00:08:57,279
that doesn't have a surface to sit on, for example,

205
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,262
which seems silly, but it might be

206
00:09:00,302 --> 00:09:01,803
very pleasing to look at, right?

207
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:03,945
If it's well done, it might be very beautiful.

208
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:11,001
Another good thing about this would be that it would probably be cheaper than building a regular chair

209
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:15,104
because we would need less material but at the same time it would have very low usability, right?

210
00:09:15,124 --> 00:09:16,085
We could not sit on it.

211
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:18,526
Maybe as a product of art this might be interesting.

212
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:20,247
If I was an artist I could build this chair.

213
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:25,331
But as a designer I don't think this would fit any of the needs that this product would have.

214
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,892
And so the same thing going back to Hitman.

215
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:29,994
We can come up with some very quick ideas.

216
00:09:30,034 --> 00:09:32,355
For example, we could make a Hitman endless runner.

217
00:09:34,027 --> 00:09:35,888
would probably work pretty well on the platform,

218
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:38,810
on mobile platforms, but it would greatly conflict

219
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,032
with brand identity, and to be honest,

220
00:09:42,092 --> 00:09:44,173
it would also be kind of aiming for the wrong audience.

221
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:46,915
And maybe another example could be

222
00:09:46,955 --> 00:09:48,476
if we made a port kind of thing

223
00:09:48,516 --> 00:09:49,776
where we used like a third person.

224
00:09:50,377 --> 00:09:53,380
point of view with virtual joysticks on mobile.

225
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:55,763
This would probably come pretty close

226
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,325
to the original experience that people know from Hitman.

227
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,528
It would have very low usability

228
00:10:00,588 --> 00:10:02,650
and I guess also would be kind of the wrong platform

229
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,272
because people that want to play these games,

230
00:10:04,832 --> 00:10:06,714
I guess they play them on consoles.

231
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:09,878
And so kind of just laying out these constraints here,

232
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,701
you note that I put four of them in black.

233
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:16,528
I think depending on how you work or what you focus on,

234
00:10:16,548 --> 00:10:18,028
you can really empathize certain things

235
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:19,669
and also depending on the product that you're building.

236
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:22,491
But for us, I think the main important constraints

237
00:10:22,531 --> 00:10:24,992
really were platform, brand, audience, and production.

238
00:10:25,432 --> 00:10:27,053
I didn't put business model in black there

239
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:28,414
because right from the beginning,

240
00:10:28,454 --> 00:10:31,776
it was clear that we're gonna make a premium product.

241
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:33,757
And so we didn't have to really work with that

242
00:10:34,617 --> 00:10:35,397
during the development.

243
00:10:36,258 --> 00:10:41,161
And so the question here is how can we use these constraints to come up with a great idea and a great product?

244
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:47,325
And unfortunately I don't think we can, because what we're looking at is a pure top-down model.

245
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:51,488
This is a pure analytic and strategic and also very rational model.

246
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:57,512
I think this is pretty interesting to look at it that way, but this really doesn't lead to any ideas,

247
00:10:57,572 --> 00:11:00,153
at least in my case I don't think that led to any ideas.

248
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:04,027
And what we're looking at is more like a set of tools

249
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:07,348
that allow us to evaluate the creative developments.

250
00:11:07,508 --> 00:11:10,830
And as you probably expect, the very contrary approach

251
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,190
to this would be a bottom-up approach,

252
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,892
where we're looking at a more experimental and random,

253
00:11:15,352 --> 00:11:16,853
and also maybe personal and intuitive

254
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:17,993
kind of way of building things.

255
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:21,836
that has kind of the idea to become the raw material

256
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:22,656
of what we're working with.

257
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:25,158
And so you've probably heard this before

258
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,959
and you've probably seen GDC talks about,

259
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,001
or any other talks about this kind of top-down

260
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:31,302
and bottom-up approach, which is very popular

261
00:11:31,342 --> 00:11:33,544
in many different fields, not just game design.

262
00:11:33,564 --> 00:11:36,486
And it's really this idea of top-down evaluation

263
00:11:36,506 --> 00:11:37,447
and bottom-up creation.

264
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:39,548
And there's many different ways of putting it,

265
00:11:39,748 --> 00:11:41,330
top-down, converging thinking,

266
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:44,672
versus bottom-up diverging and making.

267
00:11:45,252 --> 00:11:48,275
But the way I like to call it is being smart and being stupid.

268
00:11:49,824 --> 00:11:52,667
And so this doesn't mean smart and stupid in a sense

269
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:55,490
that you have to be dumb and smart,

270
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:57,613
but more smart and stupid in a sense

271
00:11:57,653 --> 00:11:59,255
that you have to have this high-level approach

272
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:01,197
where you have to consider as many things as possible

273
00:12:01,737 --> 00:12:04,360
and being stupid and kind of reckless sometimes

274
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,443
to come up with ideas that seem impossible

275
00:12:06,603 --> 00:12:08,745
or seem out of the beaten path.

276
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:13,374
And I think Diesel did a very cool campaign at some point.

277
00:12:13,555 --> 00:12:16,079
They had this kind of photographs

278
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:17,100
of people doing weird things.

279
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,223
And they always had these taglines kind of building

280
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:21,327
on that saying, smart critiques, stupid creates.

281
00:12:22,128 --> 00:12:24,491
Or this one, stupid might fail, smart doesn't even try.

282
00:12:25,697 --> 00:12:29,240
And so, kind of building on that, we needed an idea for a game.

283
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:32,804
And for that, I decided to be completely stupid and bought him up.

284
00:12:33,565 --> 00:12:38,450
And at the time, I was talking to my friend and colleague, Antoine,

285
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,652
who became the technical director of the game.

286
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:43,415
I told him, listen, I got this all figured out.

287
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:44,836
I know how mobile games are made.

288
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:47,859
There's only two types of mobile games that need to be made.

289
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,820
Only two types.

290
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,261
Very simple.

291
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,892
There's games that have a very short individual session,

292
00:12:55,012 --> 00:12:58,493
so games like Temple Run that are in real time,

293
00:12:58,553 --> 00:13:00,333
but failing at Temple Run doesn't really matter

294
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:01,514
because you can just replay.

295
00:13:02,194 --> 00:13:04,134
And it's really this overall, this big level goal

296
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:06,915
of grinding coins, of the meta game that makes it important.

297
00:13:06,935 --> 00:13:09,136
So you can play this in between two bus stops,

298
00:13:09,176 --> 00:13:10,276
and even if you get interrupted,

299
00:13:10,316 --> 00:13:11,376
it doesn't really matter so much

300
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:13,097
because every session is kind of replaceable

301
00:13:13,117 --> 00:13:13,677
with another one.

302
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:16,138
And on the other hand, there's turn-based games

303
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:16,818
like Triple Town.

304
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:22,643
turn-based games that obviously wait for the user to interact with it and so we

305
00:13:22,663 --> 00:13:25,666
can put them down, pick them back up easily and we don't get interrupted for

306
00:13:25,726 --> 00:13:30,310
anything. And since I didn't feel like making a kind of fast-paced game and I

307
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,874
think Hitman is more like a strategic and smart game in a sense, I think

308
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:37,638
turn-based was a great inspiration and so I said let's make a turn-based Hitman

309
00:13:37,678 --> 00:13:37,838
game.

310
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:43,964
And this is probably looking pretty stupid, there's no kind of rational thought behind this.

311
00:13:45,065 --> 00:13:50,069
And also looking at it today, believing that there's only two types of mobile games is a pretty silly idea,

312
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:54,053
but I think at the point, at the time we were building this, this was enough of an inspiration,

313
00:13:54,073 --> 00:13:56,235
kind of initial spark to get started on something.

314
00:13:57,016 --> 00:13:59,358
So we said turn-based simplified Hitman.

315
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:01,460
That was going to look like The Sims.

316
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:07,245
Top-down, 3D, lots of characters, lots of details, fully animated.

317
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:08,389
Because why not?

318
00:14:09,787 --> 00:14:10,848
And so we had to be smart.

319
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:13,531
We were, as I said, we were working

320
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:14,732
in this incubation moment.

321
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:16,073
We had to convince our colleagues,

322
00:14:16,474 --> 00:14:18,156
and then later down the line, the GL board,

323
00:14:19,277 --> 00:14:20,178
about making this game.

324
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,321
And so we came up with this strategy of saying

325
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:25,243
we want to make a game, a Hitman game,

326
00:14:25,283 --> 00:14:26,745
that's basically based on three things.

327
00:14:27,305 --> 00:14:30,288
We want to base it off making a highly accessible game,

328
00:14:30,348 --> 00:14:31,690
so a game that you can pick up and play

329
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,831
without knowing anything about the game.

330
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:35,622
the previous experiences, the previous Hitman games,

331
00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:38,184
but at the same time, you want to make a deep game,

332
00:14:38,204 --> 00:14:40,587
a game that has the full Hitman experience,

333
00:14:40,627 --> 00:14:41,808
that really starts off simple,

334
00:14:41,828 --> 00:14:44,431
but gets more complicated and more interesting as you go,

335
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:47,554
and a game that has very high production value,

336
00:14:47,574 --> 00:14:49,236
because we are Square Enix,

337
00:14:49,276 --> 00:14:51,618
and people have expectations towards what we build.

338
00:14:52,445 --> 00:14:53,725
And that worked pretty well.

339
00:14:53,785 --> 00:14:55,606
People really liked the idea at the studio,

340
00:14:55,706 --> 00:14:58,007
and then later we were allowed to go to Greenlight with it,

341
00:14:58,227 --> 00:14:59,767
and within a short amount of time,

342
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:03,029
actually, we managed to go into development of the game.

343
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:05,209
And so we entered this kind of process,

344
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:07,170
and I guess even before that,

345
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,391
we did this kind of round of prototypes,

346
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:10,251
so there was four people.

347
00:15:11,252 --> 00:15:12,992
And during two weeks, we built this prototype,

348
00:15:13,032 --> 00:15:14,053
actually iterating a lot,

349
00:15:14,073 --> 00:15:15,313
building a lot of different prototypes,

350
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,154
but it's this one prototype that really led everything.

351
00:15:18,274 --> 00:15:20,595
And for that, again, taking a very bottom-up

352
00:15:20,635 --> 00:15:22,775
and stupid approach, coming up with game mechanics,

353
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:24,116
was what we tried to do.

354
00:15:24,236 --> 00:15:27,217
And so, having worked about a year, I guess,

355
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:30,138
on big AAA Hitman game,

356
00:15:31,538 --> 00:15:34,319
we identified these five things that were essential

357
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:37,260
to the Hitman gameplay experience.

358
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,581
And you might say this is pretty dumbed down and stupid again,

359
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:42,742
but again, I think this is just to prove the point that

360
00:15:42,782 --> 00:15:45,743
something seemingly silly can spark an idea and interest

361
00:15:45,803 --> 00:15:47,444
into something that you then later can refine.

362
00:15:47,504 --> 00:15:50,925
So what we kind of dissected, what we distilled

363
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:53,126
from the Hitman experience was that there's five things.

364
00:15:53,466 --> 00:15:56,687
There's Agent 47, there's a target I have to assassinate,

365
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,048
there's enemies that can try and stop me

366
00:16:00,128 --> 00:16:01,108
from getting to my target.

367
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:05,254
There's an environment that I can be in, or that my enemies can be in,

368
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:07,295
and there's tools that I can use.

369
00:16:07,356 --> 00:16:12,298
So this could be weapons, this could be simple things like patrol paths, and so forth.

370
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:18,281
And because we had this kind of box full of these kind of board game pieces around at the office,

371
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:22,083
we thought it would be a great idea to kind of use that and to rapidly prototype ideas

372
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:24,084
before we even went into coding anything.

373
00:16:25,115 --> 00:16:29,259
And so, inspired by The Sims, we printed out these kind of architectural visualizations

374
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:33,542
of apartments, these renderings, and I remember drawing like little dots with lines on top

375
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:38,727
of it, and then starting to move around these kind of wooden pieces around, and hoping that

376
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:42,010
we would come up or stumble upon a great idea for a game design.

377
00:16:42,831 --> 00:16:43,411
And it didn't work.

378
00:16:44,826 --> 00:16:48,250
And I think, looking back, I think that was mainly because of one reason, and it was,

379
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,994
the reason for it was this very piece.

380
00:16:52,835 --> 00:16:56,519
And if you look at it, it might not be obvious, but when you think about stealth games, one

381
00:16:56,539 --> 00:16:59,362
very important thing about stealth games is the notion of being seen.

382
00:17:00,063 --> 00:17:04,784
or being hidden. So in this case Hitman is hiding behind the corner there and two

383
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:09,725
characters can't see him but if you look at our board game piece this guy has no

384
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:13,266
direction so what we realized after a while is that we had to give these

385
00:17:13,306 --> 00:17:17,668
pieces a facing direction basically. We didn't add googly eyes like I did on

386
00:17:17,688 --> 00:17:22,209
this one but I remember putting some some paper pieces on top of it to kind

387
00:17:22,229 --> 00:17:24,970
of start playing with that notion of direction.

388
00:17:25,852 --> 00:17:27,176
And that was a pretty simple learning,

389
00:17:27,216 --> 00:17:28,400
but I think it greatly helped us

390
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,924
to come up with a game design.

391
00:17:30,858 --> 00:17:34,760
Because this kind of standard stealth game material,

392
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,262
we started off with using vision cones, right?

393
00:17:38,162 --> 00:17:41,084
I remember Dishonored came out around about the time

394
00:17:41,104 --> 00:17:42,845
when we shipped, when we started working on this game,

395
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:46,827
and they had this really cool 3D visualization of view cones.

396
00:17:46,888 --> 00:17:49,029
And so obviously, I guess this and many other games

397
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,911
influenced us into starting to work with these things.

398
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,612
And we thought that was pretty great,

399
00:17:53,652 --> 00:17:55,513
and that we had found a pretty good game design

400
00:17:55,553 --> 00:17:58,495
for our project, but obviously it wasn't the case.

401
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:06,360
Especially in a scenario like this, if we expect the blue character to turn to the right,

402
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:13,124
it becomes very hard for the player to know which one of these kind of spots is going to be hidden

403
00:18:13,164 --> 00:18:14,645
and which one of these is going to be detected.

404
00:18:14,705 --> 00:18:20,189
So unless we get measuring tape out or we start to do some crazy calculations, we can't really know.

405
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:22,390
And this is something we really didn't want.

406
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,332
We really wanted to not have in our game.

407
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:27,974
We wanted it to be deterministic for people to really understand what's going on

408
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:28,875
and to really learn from.

409
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:35,025
the mechanics and I guess in this case A would not be seen and B would be kind of

410
00:18:35,085 --> 00:18:39,332
in between so again would be too complicated and so we simplified it and

411
00:18:39,372 --> 00:18:42,217
we came to this conclusion that just aligning the pawns on the grid

412
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,031
So basically on the nodes and the lines that go outside of it

413
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:46,252
would be a great idea.

414
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:47,312
And we were pretty happy with it.

415
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:49,673
And we thought we had found a great design for our game.

416
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:51,734
But obviously, this is not the end of the story.

417
00:18:51,774 --> 00:18:54,094
Because as soon as we started playing around

418
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,255
with more complicated and more interesting AI,

419
00:18:56,775 --> 00:18:59,676
like this guy here that actually ended up being in the game.

420
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:04,439
as we shift, the guy that walks back and forth in a straight line

421
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,682
seems fairly straightforward, especially in this case.

422
00:19:08,742 --> 00:19:11,724
I guess we can imagine the blue guy going up and down on this axis there.

423
00:19:12,304 --> 00:19:14,686
But what if there's a more complicated case like this one?

424
00:19:15,767 --> 00:19:18,248
Do we expect the blue guy, after moving forward,

425
00:19:18,268 --> 00:19:21,130
to be expecting to move left and right, left or right?

426
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,491
or maybe you can go back.

427
00:19:23,672 --> 00:19:25,273
And I think even though we could have come up

428
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:27,274
with some sort of rule and programmed that rule

429
00:19:27,314 --> 00:19:29,475
and mechanic, kind of a hidden logic,

430
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,756
we wanted to be visible for the user, right?

431
00:19:31,776 --> 00:19:33,577
We could have said, like, if there's a certain angle

432
00:19:33,618 --> 00:19:35,859
that has to be satisfied, or if there has to be

433
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:37,700
some sort of a flow, right?

434
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,281
We could always say, character turns right

435
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:41,122
if he can't go forward, but we didn't want to do this.

436
00:19:41,142 --> 00:19:43,683
We wanted to be as simple and straightforward as possible

437
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:43,984
because...

438
00:19:44,864 --> 00:19:48,285
Again, looking at it from a top-down view,

439
00:19:48,685 --> 00:19:50,006
considering platform and audience,

440
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:51,166
we're looking at small screens,

441
00:19:51,246 --> 00:19:53,847
and we're looking at people who have possibly

442
00:19:53,907 --> 00:19:55,608
never played complicated games before.

443
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:58,448
We went with this more simplified approach

444
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,349
and said, just straighten it out.

445
00:20:00,469 --> 00:20:01,769
And then, I guess, at the end,

446
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,291
coming up with this very simple and distilled way

447
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:09,092
of creating the mechanics for the game.

448
00:20:09,112 --> 00:20:10,092
And we thought that was pretty great.

449
00:20:10,772 --> 00:20:12,653
And spoiler alert, I guess if you've played the game,

450
00:20:12,693 --> 00:20:16,195
this is pretty close to what the game design ended up being.

451
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,276
And even though you might say that this is very simple

452
00:20:19,316 --> 00:20:22,278
and almost a bit bland, I think working on this

453
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:25,539
so intensely and actually simplifying it

454
00:20:25,579 --> 00:20:28,721
and building it down so much helped us building this core

455
00:20:29,421 --> 00:20:32,283
that actually held up up until,

456
00:20:32,783 --> 00:20:34,444
actually throughout the whole production of the game.

457
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:37,485
And so this was really the most basic building block

458
00:20:37,525 --> 00:20:38,466
that we used to build it.

459
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:42,529
And from there we could extrapolate and we could come up with all these cool mechanics

460
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:47,734
that existed in stealth games and in hitman games and we could then fuel them back into

461
00:20:47,795 --> 00:20:48,435
our experience.

462
00:20:48,475 --> 00:20:55,722
And so we added distractions, we added civilians, social stealth like hiding in a crowd, trespassing,

463
00:20:55,762 --> 00:21:00,447
disguises, multiple player pawns, weapons, hacking and so on.

464
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:02,549
But obviously a lot of these didn't work out.

465
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,951
throughout the iteration, trial and error, I guess,

466
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:08,613
prototyping many things, we found out that a lot of these

467
00:21:08,653 --> 00:21:11,654
things actually didn't work from a brand perspective,

468
00:21:11,955 --> 00:21:14,116
or were too complicated, or just not feasible,

469
00:21:14,536 --> 00:21:16,377
or just out of scope for the project that we had.

470
00:21:16,477 --> 00:21:18,839
But we added new ones, and we did cycle kind of

471
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:21,220
a couple of times, and I guess this is how

472
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,861
the set of mechanics that you played today

473
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:24,622
in Hitman Go came to happen.

474
00:21:25,514 --> 00:21:27,818
And so again, four guys working two weeks,

475
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:29,942
I guess this core was really built within two weeks

476
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:33,127
on one prototype, and then later we extrapolated from that.

477
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:36,445
There's only one elephant in the room, which was The Sims.

478
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:39,688
We had promised to make a game that was beautifully animated

479
00:21:39,728 --> 00:21:42,451
and fully 3D and everything, but we came to realize

480
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:45,875
that we had to be smarter about it in terms of production.

481
00:21:46,115 --> 00:21:47,977
If we had six months to build this game

482
00:21:48,017 --> 00:21:49,899
and we had already kind of a cool design,

483
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,843
we would never be able to make and ship this game

484
00:21:53,223 --> 00:21:55,245
within the time constraints that were established.

485
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,072
And so looking at the material that we were playing with

486
00:21:59,132 --> 00:22:01,094
to kind of prototype and come up with the idea,

487
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:02,955
we thought that this would be a great idea

488
00:22:02,975 --> 00:22:06,818
to kind of simplify also in terms of scope.

489
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:10,661
And we used this board game aesthetic

490
00:22:12,102 --> 00:22:15,445
to kind of come up with a better scope for the game.

491
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:18,006
And this was great because we didn't need animations,

492
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:20,188
we could work with static environments,

493
00:22:21,129 --> 00:22:22,710
and there was no SFX needed.

494
00:22:23,971 --> 00:22:25,212
And at the same time, this kind of...

495
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:29,175
just opened up a lot of new ideas, again, very bottom up.

496
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:33,099
We came up with this diorama and scale model vision

497
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,302
that just was very related to the board games.

498
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:38,483
And so we went into kind of figuring out

499
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,624
what our direction could be.

500
00:22:41,286 --> 00:22:44,028
Again, pretending to be very stupid and very bottom up,

501
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:47,071
looking at these scale models, and I think

502
00:22:48,852 --> 00:22:50,133
Yeah, I think when looking at these,

503
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:52,615
it is very tempting to just go crazy and say,

504
00:22:52,635 --> 00:22:54,977
we want to build these beautifully modeled

505
00:22:55,017 --> 00:22:56,798
and beautifully lush environments

506
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:58,439
with a lot of characters.

507
00:22:58,519 --> 00:22:59,980
And obviously the first thing you see

508
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,842
if you Google these kind of images

509
00:23:02,082 --> 00:23:04,364
is a lot of these kind of train sets

510
00:23:05,184 --> 00:23:07,426
that I guess grown men build in their apartments

511
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,848
and then forbid their kids to touch them.

512
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:12,370
And I think that was cool, right?

513
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:14,172
It was a great inspiration, but at the same time,

514
00:23:14,192 --> 00:23:16,495
again, being smart, looking at it from a brand perspective,

515
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,998
it didn't exactly work.

516
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:20,700
Even though there was some potential in it,

517
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:23,224
I think it still felt a little bit too nerdy

518
00:23:23,264 --> 00:23:25,246
and a bit too obscure for what we're trying to build.

519
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:30,088
And so, working with Rasmus, who was the old art director

520
00:23:30,128 --> 00:23:32,989
on the AAA game, who had experience working at IO,

521
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:35,850
and then also with the people still at IO,

522
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,391
I think we managed to kind of get to know the brand

523
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:40,751
much better, and really distill down the essence

524
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:43,232
of what Hitman means and what Hitman is.

525
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:46,104
And there's a couple of things that really struck with us.

526
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:48,004
So there's this kind of notion of globe trotting,

527
00:23:48,384 --> 00:23:49,825
hitman traveling around the world

528
00:23:50,445 --> 00:23:53,126
to these kind of exotic locations and luxurious mansions

529
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:56,286
that he has to go and take out this evil people

530
00:23:56,326 --> 00:23:57,587
that he has to assassinate.

531
00:23:58,987 --> 00:24:01,327
And then there's things like sterile environments,

532
00:24:01,347 --> 00:24:04,128
like even though these people have these huge mansions,

533
00:24:04,228 --> 00:24:06,349
some of them are pretty empty and it's kind of boring,

534
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:09,089
as you expect from rich people's places.

535
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:12,230
And there's this very interesting notion of voyeurism

536
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,770
in stealth games in general.

537
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:13,950
So.

538
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:17,833
if you're navigating an environment and you're not seen,

539
00:24:17,853 --> 00:24:20,535
that allows you to overhear and eavesdrop on conversations

540
00:24:20,615 --> 00:24:23,496
of people and NPCs that don't expect you to do so.

541
00:24:23,657 --> 00:24:26,378
And I think if you've played stealth games before,

542
00:24:26,418 --> 00:24:28,260
again, this is a very big thing.

543
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,061
I think especially in Hitman, they used this to.

544
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:34,203
Tell these kind of weird and funny stories every once in a while you overhear something

545
00:24:35,003 --> 00:24:36,604
So there's the story in absolution

546
00:24:36,624 --> 00:24:42,107
There's this moment where you hear a guy on a phone talking about his doctor and getting a note that he is not

547
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:43,768
Ill or he's not sick

548
00:24:44,689 --> 00:24:47,430
And the minute later you throw him out of the window. So there's this kind of weird

549
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:54,261
funny notation of voyeurism and also this kind of rational cold kind of

550
00:24:54,341 --> 00:24:58,848
atmosphere to to assassinating people I guess in general and on top of that this

551
00:24:58,908 --> 00:25:02,694
really understated and slick feel that Hitman games have.

552
00:25:03,495 --> 00:25:05,898
And we really thought that we need to capture this better

553
00:25:05,918 --> 00:25:07,499
instead of just building a train set,

554
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,081
or train model environment,

555
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:10,623
and really get to know what HIPMAM was.

556
00:25:11,123 --> 00:25:13,306
And here's, I guess, the four inspirations

557
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:17,450
that we then used to really come closer

558
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,491
to this brand identity.

559
00:25:18,531 --> 00:25:21,274
And the first one was architectural models.

560
00:25:22,195 --> 00:25:24,657
And so, instead of just looking at scale models

561
00:25:24,717 --> 00:25:26,078
and these kind of little figurines,

562
00:25:26,738 --> 00:25:28,960
we really like the aesthetic of architectural models

563
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,482
because it's more about a global

564
00:25:31,642 --> 00:25:34,223
and a more approximate kind of way of building something.

565
00:25:34,263 --> 00:25:37,566
It's more about materials, it's more about shapes,

566
00:25:38,346 --> 00:25:40,628
much more than just details and little things.

567
00:25:40,668 --> 00:25:42,129
And if you see an architectural model,

568
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:44,230
maybe once in a while there's a little detail,

569
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,671
there's a figurine, but it's mostly there

570
00:25:45,691 --> 00:25:47,953
just to indicate scale and it's not there to tell a story.

571
00:25:49,873 --> 00:25:53,014
And then there's the voyeuristic nature of these kind of

572
00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:55,655
stealth games that I thought still could be portrayed

573
00:25:55,715 --> 00:25:57,476
pretty well with the scale models.

574
00:25:57,536 --> 00:25:59,076
If you look at these kind of dioramas,

575
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:00,717
you always see these freeze frames,

576
00:26:01,157 --> 00:26:03,718
freeze frame scenarios of people talking,

577
00:26:03,758 --> 00:26:05,878
of people arguing, or people just enjoying themselves.

578
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:08,619
And so you could almost like see how you could

579
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:10,059
interpret that as.

580
00:26:11,022 --> 00:26:13,644
watching people doing things and kind of watching on them.

581
00:26:14,604 --> 00:26:17,205
And then obviously the rational, cold thing

582
00:26:17,245 --> 00:26:20,627
that we kind of learned from chess and board games

583
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:24,749
in general, very calculated, just moving pawns

584
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:27,010
on the check board like you would in Hitman.

585
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,832
It's basically playing puppeteering and engineering,

586
00:26:30,012 --> 00:26:31,473
I guess, situations around.

587
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:34,394
And then last but not least, the luxurious and sterile

588
00:26:35,395 --> 00:26:38,096
that we borrowed from the blog Rich Kids of Instagram.

589
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:42,048
I don't know if you're familiar with that, but it's a pretty great Tumblr.

590
00:26:42,088 --> 00:26:44,149
It's basically a curating site.

591
00:26:44,189 --> 00:26:49,550
My friend Eric, who was a narrative designer in the old AAA days, had got me onto this

592
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,571
and it's truly brilliant.

593
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:52,411
You should check it out.

594
00:26:52,431 --> 00:26:57,132
It's basically kids from very rich backgrounds taking pictures and this website curates them

595
00:26:57,572 --> 00:26:58,733
and shows their daily lives.

596
00:26:59,293 --> 00:27:06,195
It's pretty impressive because even though it's a very luxurious lifestyle and it's everything

597
00:27:06,215 --> 00:27:08,015
you can possibly imagine, but at the same time...

598
00:27:08,495 --> 00:27:10,777
there's this kind of bland and sterile look to it

599
00:27:11,477 --> 00:27:12,798
because these places are huge,

600
00:27:12,858 --> 00:27:13,918
they show they're huge houses,

601
00:27:13,978 --> 00:27:15,119
but they're always kind of empty,

602
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:17,020
it's always the same kind of goods,

603
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,081
it's always the same cars,

604
00:27:18,121 --> 00:27:19,882
it's always the same purses and so forth,

605
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:21,443
so it's really worth checking out.

606
00:27:22,448 --> 00:27:25,109
And so having that, we really felt like we had

607
00:27:25,149 --> 00:27:27,550
a really solid base, but again, making that happen

608
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,051
was not just a matter of art direction,

609
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:32,253
but it was actually a matter of producing levels

610
00:27:32,293 --> 00:27:33,233
and producing level art.

611
00:27:34,294 --> 00:27:37,635
And so, again, just to emphasize this kind of

612
00:27:37,695 --> 00:27:39,596
two-tiered approach of being bottom-up

613
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,017
and being top-down at the same time,

614
00:27:42,438 --> 00:27:45,419
we were greatly inspired by these two main references,

615
00:27:45,459 --> 00:27:47,000
which were architectural models and

616
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,102
scale models, dioramas, and we kind of identified

617
00:27:52,142 --> 00:27:55,123
a couple of cool things, the physicality of things, right?

618
00:27:55,163 --> 00:27:56,383
How are things built?

619
00:27:56,443 --> 00:27:57,404
Is it made out of wood?

620
00:27:57,724 --> 00:27:58,824
Is it made out of cardboard?

621
00:27:58,864 --> 00:28:01,005
And how could we portray these material properties

622
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:02,446
in the game?

623
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:05,347
Then there's this idea of variety,

624
00:28:05,407 --> 00:28:06,628
because everything is handmade,

625
00:28:06,648 --> 00:28:09,149
we expect things to not be entirely perfect, right?

626
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:12,430
Especially if you look at scale models,

627
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,011
there's a lot of this variety going on,

628
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:16,992
because everything is basically put on by a person.

629
00:28:18,033 --> 00:28:19,773
And there's this kind of imperfection,

630
00:28:19,873 --> 00:28:21,494
something really interesting, artifacts.

631
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:25,154
If you think about dioramas, especially like things

632
00:28:25,194 --> 00:28:27,775
like paint being scratched off a little bit

633
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:30,476
through the production of the diorama itself,

634
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:32,736
or maybe a little bit of glue that sticks out

635
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:35,097
underneath a grass surface and so forth.

636
00:28:36,157 --> 00:28:37,957
And in general, just adding a lot of detail,

637
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:39,398
we thought that would be the right way to go

638
00:28:39,478 --> 00:28:42,258
to really portray this view and this vision

639
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:44,639
of this kind of physical environment.

640
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:48,001
But again, looking at it from a high level perspective

641
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:48,981
and considering production,

642
00:28:49,001 --> 00:28:50,963
this was still very much out of scope.

643
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:53,805
And so, we proposed a very different system.

644
00:28:54,845 --> 00:28:57,307
And I guess this was one of the early sketches I did,

645
00:28:57,367 --> 00:28:59,088
just modeled this quickly for a prototype,

646
00:28:59,128 --> 00:29:00,869
but the idea was to build the entire game

647
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:03,591
out of these four by four meter cubes,

648
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:05,793
or blocks, I guess, with different heights.

649
00:29:06,253 --> 00:29:08,955
And as you can see, there's different pieces for pool,

650
00:29:08,995 --> 00:29:11,736
there's pieces for roads, for house,

651
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:14,018
for grass, and so forth.

652
00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:16,841
And this seemed pretty wacky at the beginning,

653
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:20,184
but it actually ended up being the exact pipeline

654
00:29:20,204 --> 00:29:21,065
that we did for the game.

655
00:29:21,966 --> 00:29:23,107
And so if you've played the game,

656
00:29:23,147 --> 00:29:24,708
you might recognize some of these places.

657
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:28,432
So we built entire sets for tennis courts, the greenhouse,

658
00:29:29,153 --> 00:29:31,335
the pool, the mansion, and so forth.

659
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,581
And also, if you've played the game,

660
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:37,423
you'll notice that we had these different locations.

661
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:39,364
So we had different boxes of environments.

662
00:29:39,424 --> 00:29:42,707
And for every of these boxes, we build actually a set of pieces.

663
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:44,988
So it's pretty much like LEGO bricks, actually.

664
00:29:45,008 --> 00:29:47,190
You could just snap them together and play around

665
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:47,590
with them.

666
00:29:48,471 --> 00:29:51,213
Then on top of that, we had little pieces,

667
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:52,874
little detail pieces that we could then

668
00:29:53,054 --> 00:29:54,915
add to kind of break up the rhythm

669
00:29:54,955 --> 00:29:57,697
and break up this kind of pattern-like behavior

670
00:29:57,737 --> 00:29:58,358
of the modules.

671
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,319
And I thought that was pretty great

672
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,184
because we could run level art and design in parallel,

673
00:30:04,224 --> 00:30:05,545
right, we were really fast with this

674
00:30:05,585 --> 00:30:08,209
because as I was building the levels in Unity

675
00:30:08,369 --> 00:30:09,530
with this editor that we had,

676
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:12,514
the level artist could basically model the blocks

677
00:30:12,554 --> 00:30:13,575
and then I could play around

678
00:30:13,635 --> 00:30:15,758
without having too much dependency on each other.

679
00:30:16,662 --> 00:30:19,746
And it also greatly helped us creating this unified look

680
00:30:21,228 --> 00:30:23,731
that I think is always very hard to achieve in games

681
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:26,395
in general, making something that looks like it's only made

682
00:30:26,415 --> 00:30:30,680
by one person or by one general idea that brings everything

683
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,060
together.

684
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,343
And obeying this very strict system

685
00:30:33,383 --> 00:30:34,625
helped us greatly to achieve that.

686
00:30:35,506 --> 00:30:37,387
And even though it is kind of hard to work with,

687
00:30:37,427 --> 00:30:40,288
I think also again, constraint on a very low level,

688
00:30:40,308 --> 00:30:42,810
it applied these very interesting constraints

689
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:44,791
that I guess were very inspiring also for us

690
00:30:45,131 --> 00:30:46,572
to come up with different locations,

691
00:30:46,652 --> 00:30:48,733
different sets, different environments and so forth.

692
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:52,415
And so this is I guess a couple of screenshots to show you.

693
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,900
how this actually worked in an applied sense.

694
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,983
So this is the screenshot from the editor, Barebones.

695
00:31:00,043 --> 00:31:01,464
I guess we had this really cool tool

696
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,385
that the programmers built,

697
00:31:02,425 --> 00:31:04,588
where we could just place out these little circles

698
00:31:04,708 --> 00:31:05,829
and connect them with lines.

699
00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:08,632
And then on top of that, we replaced the pawns,

700
00:31:08,712 --> 00:31:10,153
I guess the spawners for the pawns

701
00:31:10,213 --> 00:31:11,735
and the spawners for the tools,

702
00:31:11,755 --> 00:31:12,956
like the distraction you see here.

703
00:31:13,717 --> 00:31:15,259
And then obviously the extraction point

704
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:16,260
where Hitman has to go to.

705
00:31:17,902 --> 00:31:20,063
And then the next step would be take all of these pieces

706
00:31:20,143 --> 00:31:22,244
and kind of play with it and arrange them a little bit

707
00:31:22,644 --> 00:31:24,285
and start coming up with a cool environment.

708
00:31:24,345 --> 00:31:26,026
Obviously doing a lot of iterations to this,

709
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,627
considering the different environments that were before

710
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:29,828
and the levels before and after,

711
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:31,769
but really starting to play Lego with this.

712
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:34,390
And once we were happy with a certain design,

713
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:36,711
we kind of put that closer together,

714
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:39,613
added a little bit more detail,

715
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:42,834
like this wooden frame that became pretty iconic

716
00:31:42,874 --> 00:31:45,876
to the game, and maybe a bit more detail,

717
00:31:45,896 --> 00:31:47,017
like the grass hedges there.

718
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:52,343
And then later on we would add more small detail like the trees

719
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:57,608
The little figurines that would tell kind of the story going on and so forth

720
00:31:57,648 --> 00:32:01,151
And then the last step would be to just light the levels with lightmap

721
00:32:02,032 --> 00:32:03,433
classic lightmaps, I guess

722
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,602
And so really this kind of initial model

723
00:32:06,722 --> 00:32:10,505
of focusing on physicality, focusing on high variety

724
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:12,868
and then artifacts and a lot of detail everywhere,

725
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:16,331
kind of was refined into a model

726
00:32:16,371 --> 00:32:18,032
that was more focusing on composition,

727
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:19,994
especially because of the modules,

728
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:23,237
the modular system you had the chance to be very iterative

729
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:26,600
and to do a lot of different, just trial and error,

730
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,241
a lot of different variations on these levels.

731
00:32:28,281 --> 00:32:29,963
And so we really got to work with this.

732
00:32:31,184 --> 00:32:33,504
and at the same time capturing that idea

733
00:32:33,524 --> 00:32:36,425
from the freeze frame life from scale models

734
00:32:36,465 --> 00:32:37,686
and really putting in these characters,

735
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,026
trying to tell a little bit of a story,

736
00:32:39,046 --> 00:32:40,107
a little bit of an environment.

737
00:32:41,467 --> 00:32:43,388
Working with cross sections, like you can see there,

738
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,709
the pool being cut in half, I think is a very strong

739
00:32:46,749 --> 00:32:49,610
kind of image and makes people really think about this

740
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:52,551
as a manufactured object or something that you would have

741
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,693
on your coffee table or maybe in a showcase and so forth.

742
00:32:57,933 --> 00:32:59,915
And instead of having detail all over the place,

743
00:32:59,955 --> 00:33:02,257
we actually decided to be way more selective about it.

744
00:33:02,998 --> 00:33:05,921
And so even though, one thing that's quite interesting,

745
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:07,963
even though a lot of people consider Hitman Go

746
00:33:08,023 --> 00:33:09,884
to be a very naturalistic-looking game,

747
00:33:10,325 --> 00:33:12,587
there's actually only one texture, as far as I remember,

748
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:15,950
that is truly naturalistic, which is this wood piece.

749
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,813
Everything else is either untextured or has textures

750
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:20,935
that have nothing to do with the original material

751
00:33:20,975 --> 00:33:22,396
that we're trying to emulate, for example.

752
00:33:24,017 --> 00:33:25,698
the grass, I think it's a sort of a carpet

753
00:33:25,718 --> 00:33:28,278
that just looked really good on the screen

754
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:30,099
and on what we're trying to do with it.

755
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,521
And this helped us greatly with readability, right?

756
00:33:34,561 --> 00:33:35,941
Again, looking at it from the constraints

757
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:37,442
about the platform, we wanted this game

758
00:33:37,462 --> 00:33:39,482
to be able to be played on small screens

759
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:42,483
and on tablets, and so having high readability

760
00:33:42,523 --> 00:33:44,504
was really important for us, and I guess

761
00:33:44,544 --> 00:33:47,005
focusing on these things helped us manage

762
00:33:47,045 --> 00:33:49,486
to create a game that was very readable.

763
00:33:50,623 --> 00:33:52,284
And so there's one last anecdote, I guess,

764
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:54,805
before I want to wrap things up.

765
00:33:55,525 --> 00:33:58,045
And so, a very important thing, I guess,

766
00:33:58,065 --> 00:34:00,666
to making AAA games transition into mobile games,

767
00:34:00,686 --> 00:34:01,786
which is the story aspect.

768
00:34:01,826 --> 00:34:03,187
And this is a pretty tough one,

769
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:04,647
because as you might expect,

770
00:34:04,707 --> 00:34:06,688
AAA games focus a lot on story,

771
00:34:07,148 --> 00:34:09,068
and mobile games don't do so as much.

772
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:14,109
And so again, being very bottom-up in this field,

773
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,710
whoops, sorry, we looked at our inspiration again.

774
00:34:18,271 --> 00:34:19,472
And again, as I mentioned it before,

775
00:34:19,492 --> 00:34:21,475
these kind of little figurines, these stories,

776
00:34:21,875 --> 00:34:23,697
like this car that broke down

777
00:34:23,737 --> 00:34:25,699
and the guy's trying to explain to a police officer

778
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,101
and the boy's doing something in the background.

779
00:34:27,121 --> 00:34:28,943
This is just a moment of life

780
00:34:29,003 --> 00:34:30,765
and we can totally come up with a story in our head

781
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:31,906
after we watch these.

782
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:34,349
And we were greatly inspired again by this.

783
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:37,726
And at the same time, I mentioned that we had

784
00:34:37,766 --> 00:34:41,589
these modular systems that were developing pretty quickly

785
00:34:42,349 --> 00:34:44,611
and we were really inspired to just play around,

786
00:34:44,731 --> 00:34:47,033
bottom up, be very stupid as I would call it,

787
00:34:47,493 --> 00:34:48,534
and come up with cool ideas.

788
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:53,357
And so we created this set of pieces of blocks

789
00:34:53,397 --> 00:34:55,719
that were based around roads and networks.

790
00:34:56,843 --> 00:35:05,631
And so you can see here, this is like a suburban kind of environment with a lot of roads, street signs, and these trees growing in between the lanes and so forth.

791
00:35:06,111 --> 00:35:09,774
And we thought that would be a really cool testbed for our ideas with stories.

792
00:35:09,814 --> 00:35:15,800
So the initial idea was to have these kind of developing stories from multiple levels.

793
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:20,824
And so on this one we did a test where we wanted to have like a car accident,

794
00:35:20,944 --> 00:35:23,987
like this guy is trying to get away and you're following him on a...

795
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:28,593
highway and then he crashes and he tries to run away and at some point in some

796
00:35:28,613 --> 00:35:31,917
level you would actually then get to kill him. And there's something that was

797
00:35:31,957 --> 00:35:35,642
really interesting is that no one really understood that we did a test with this

798
00:35:35,762 --> 00:35:38,606
and no one really got the coherence between different levels right no one

799
00:35:38,646 --> 00:35:41,509
understood there was like a continuous story going on in between levels

800
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,893
I think it's hard to say why that's the case,

801
00:35:45,634 --> 00:35:48,176
but I think it's also just because people are very focused

802
00:35:48,196 --> 00:35:49,598
on solving the puzzles much more

803
00:35:49,658 --> 00:35:51,059
than just observing the environment

804
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,723
and also kind of breaking these kind of abstract pieces

805
00:35:54,743 --> 00:35:56,125
apart from each other

806
00:35:56,165 --> 00:35:57,706
and not having one continuous experience

807
00:35:57,746 --> 00:35:58,727
because you go through loading

808
00:35:58,767 --> 00:35:59,848
and level selection every time.

809
00:35:59,888 --> 00:36:02,912
It just didn't allow people to understand these stories.

810
00:36:03,709 --> 00:36:08,291
And I guess one great example for this is something that we only refer to as the

811
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:12,053
gas station at Square Enix Montreal, which is kind of this weird thing that

812
00:36:12,093 --> 00:36:17,435
everybody fears. And so this was I guess our idea to make an entire mission, this

813
00:36:17,455 --> 00:36:20,797
was supposed to become the first mission of the game, an entire mission about a hit

814
00:36:20,857 --> 00:36:24,618
and assassination that you would have to do around the gas station. And you can

815
00:36:24,658 --> 00:36:28,320
see this was not just environment art, we also did game design on it, we had these

816
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:28,900
kind of notes.

817
00:36:29,494 --> 00:36:32,299
And you can even see like, yeah,

818
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:33,581
obviously it looks a bit different now,

819
00:36:33,621 --> 00:36:36,305
but it's pretty close already to the experience we have.

820
00:36:36,325 --> 00:36:39,670
And so the idea here was that Hitman had to infiltrate

821
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,993
this kind of gas station environment

822
00:36:42,013 --> 00:36:43,736
where it was this guy that you had to go and kill.

823
00:36:44,977 --> 00:36:50,860
And there's two things, like for one, Hitman was able to go through the sewers, as you can see there.

824
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,940
That was pretty weird, I don't know why we came up with this.

825
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,842
And then the other thing was, in the top right corner you see this kind of soda machine.

826
00:36:57,862 --> 00:37:03,184
We thought that maybe coming up with a story where you would have to follow a guy who would really like soda,

827
00:37:03,224 --> 00:37:05,905
and he would drink these cans of soda, and would leave a trail behind him

828
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:09,966
to kind of explain people why you would follow a person's kind of like breadcrumbs.

829
00:37:10,807 --> 00:37:12,828
Yeah, I don't know why, but this is what we tried to do.

830
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:15,610
And so we had to ask ourselves, is this really Hitman?

831
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:19,072
And especially, I guess, looking at the AAA counterparts,

832
00:37:19,132 --> 00:37:23,595
this was not Hitman as in infiltrating these luxurious

833
00:37:23,636 --> 00:37:26,598
and exotic places, trying to kill the top evil people

834
00:37:26,618 --> 00:37:28,959
in the world, but not doing that.

835
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,481
It was, in our case, it was Hitman on the beach.

836
00:37:33,242 --> 00:37:35,124
trying to bypass a guy in blue there,

837
00:37:35,605 --> 00:37:37,867
but can't do that because there's traffic cones on the road.

838
00:37:38,868 --> 00:37:40,910
Yeah, this was actually a level that we built.

839
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,931
And so again, I think looking at it

840
00:37:42,972 --> 00:37:44,012
from a high-level perspective,

841
00:37:44,093 --> 00:37:46,154
even though I think that there's a lot of great development

842
00:37:46,194 --> 00:37:48,377
and a very creative kind of atmosphere around this,

843
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:50,018
but looking at it from a high-level perspective,

844
00:37:50,498 --> 00:37:51,620
it just didn't fit with the brand.

845
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,962
And so Rasmus, again the art director in the AAA days,

846
00:37:56,002 --> 00:37:58,263
he made the sketch for us that I think was very important

847
00:37:58,703 --> 00:38:00,304
at this point during the development.

848
00:38:00,384 --> 00:38:03,586
And he kind of took this idea of these little pieces

849
00:38:03,626 --> 00:38:05,107
of levels that we had already built

850
00:38:05,167 --> 00:38:07,248
and he designed a kind of a sketch.

851
00:38:08,628 --> 00:38:11,570
around what he thought a mission or a hit should look like.

852
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,571
And so he did these kind of key moments

853
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:16,352
in this kind of infiltrating and exfiltrating,

854
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,994
going through a hit, going through an assassination.

855
00:38:19,034 --> 00:38:21,435
So it's this kind of hitman arriving at a gate,

856
00:38:21,855 --> 00:38:23,856
and there's probably security there

857
00:38:23,876 --> 00:38:24,677
that he has to take out,

858
00:38:24,757 --> 00:38:26,277
and going through some sort of a courtyard,

859
00:38:26,377 --> 00:38:28,258
entering a house, there's a watchdog,

860
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:29,819
and then getting to an office,

861
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,141
taking out the bad guy, and then leaving again.

862
00:38:34,191 --> 00:38:37,172
And this was really, I guess, a cornerstone for us in the development.

863
00:38:37,252 --> 00:38:42,635
And also looking at the game today, I think it's cool to see how we actually used this

864
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,795
and built the levels around it.

865
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:48,057
So this is the first chapter of the game, a couple of the levels, and then so in the

866
00:38:48,097 --> 00:38:53,279
first one you can see Hitman arriving to this kind of place, to this mansion, and then going

867
00:38:53,319 --> 00:38:55,080
through some sort of a gate.

868
00:38:57,104 --> 00:39:01,566
bypassing this pool area that we've seen in many screenshots now and then, just

869
00:39:01,786 --> 00:39:04,788
all these kind of classic locations that you've probably seen also in other Hitman

870
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:09,210
games. The tennis court, a little bit of a pool house there on the left, going

871
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:12,031
through a greenhouse with a lot of guards and then entering a mansion where

872
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:16,373
finally we get to assassinate our target. So really building up this kind of story

873
00:39:16,493 --> 00:39:20,555
and this approach of Hitman that we also know from existing AAA Hitman games.

874
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,745
And so, I guess, these are kind of four anecdotes to explain a little bit this approach,

875
00:39:27,785 --> 00:39:32,009
this creative strategy of not being afraid of doing seemingly stupid things,

876
00:39:32,089 --> 00:39:37,734
but then again, also not back off from looking at it from a very rational and kind of high-level angle.

877
00:39:38,534 --> 00:39:40,995
And so the game mechanics, the art direction, the story,

878
00:39:41,035 --> 00:39:43,477
and the level art, I think they're all great examples

879
00:39:43,517 --> 00:39:45,878
of how we use this approach to make Hitman go.

880
00:39:46,758 --> 00:39:48,980
And really, as I said in the beginning,

881
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,741
don't be afraid of being smart

882
00:39:51,941 --> 00:39:54,142
and forcing yourself to be stupid every once in a while,

883
00:39:54,182 --> 00:39:57,124
to just kind of not be afraid of coming up with things

884
00:39:57,164 --> 00:40:00,145
that don't seem to be lodging.

885
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:02,306
And so on a day-to-day basis,

886
00:40:02,346 --> 00:40:03,727
I think this could be really described

887
00:40:03,787 --> 00:40:05,768
as keeping a balance between the two modes, right?

888
00:40:06,929 --> 00:40:10,991
I think Hitmango was recognized as a game that did something that was pretty unorthodox.

889
00:40:11,511 --> 00:40:15,152
A lot of people that saw the game initially, they did not really get what we're trying

890
00:40:15,192 --> 00:40:15,653
to do with it.

891
00:40:17,253 --> 00:40:22,236
But at the same time, I think really keeping this idea of the impulsive and almost intuitive

892
00:40:22,296 --> 00:40:26,377
kind of way of making games, but looking at it and evaluating it from a top-level view,

893
00:40:26,798 --> 00:40:30,179
making sure that these ideas are not just crazy for their own sake, but they actually

894
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:32,700
make sense within the big picture of the brand, the franchise.

895
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,241
the platform and so forth.

896
00:40:34,801 --> 00:40:36,401
And I guess another example that,

897
00:40:36,421 --> 00:40:37,401
if you're developing games,

898
00:40:37,441 --> 00:40:38,802
you're probably very familiar with is

899
00:40:40,102 --> 00:40:41,922
switching the team to two modes,

900
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:42,983
bottom-up and top-down.

901
00:40:44,783 --> 00:40:47,104
It's very easy to kind of fall into one of these extremes

902
00:40:47,164 --> 00:40:48,404
and just to kind of stay there.

903
00:40:49,164 --> 00:40:50,924
So if we're top-down too much,

904
00:40:50,964 --> 00:40:53,165
I guess it becomes very easy to just shoot down ideas

905
00:40:53,205 --> 00:40:56,626
because they seem too weird or stupid from the get-go.

906
00:40:56,946 --> 00:40:58,906
And if we're purely bottom-up,

907
00:40:58,946 --> 00:41:00,587
I think it becomes very easy to get lost

908
00:41:00,827 --> 00:41:02,227
and not see the big picture anymore.

909
00:41:03,487 --> 00:41:06,248
And so I guess to wrap up and to kind of come back

910
00:41:06,288 --> 00:41:07,728
where I started with this presentation,

911
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:09,769
I think now would be the time to see if I actually,

912
00:41:10,629 --> 00:41:11,910
if this actually makes any sense.

913
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,670
So going back to this idea of this comparison

914
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,391
between the chair and the game that we've been building,

915
00:41:19,231 --> 00:41:21,652
looking at Hitman Go on mobile phones

916
00:41:21,752 --> 00:41:24,813
and looking at I guess our four core constraints

917
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:26,093
that we've established in the beginning.

918
00:41:26,954 --> 00:41:28,234
And so looking at production.

919
00:41:30,794 --> 00:41:33,775
We didn't manage to ship before Christmas 2013 within six months.

920
00:41:33,835 --> 00:41:37,676
I think that was just a little bit too ambitious for everybody involved.

921
00:41:39,116 --> 00:41:40,016
But we were pretty close.

922
00:41:40,496 --> 00:41:44,957
We actually managed to finish the initial release in February 2014, and I think still

923
00:41:45,578 --> 00:41:49,978
today that this, given the fact that we're a AAA development studio and we had very little

924
00:41:50,018 --> 00:41:52,559
experience making mobile games, this was a great achievement.

925
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,932
We managed to stay a small team between four and twelve people throughout the course of

926
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:57,532
the development.

927
00:41:57,572 --> 00:42:03,194
I think also forcing this kind of dual kind of mode of being top down and bottom up is

928
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:06,636
something that really works with small teams that I've experienced and I think we really

929
00:42:06,676 --> 00:42:07,576
capitalized on that.

930
00:42:08,456 --> 00:42:12,298
And as I said before, I was actually the only person who had made mobile games before so

931
00:42:12,378 --> 00:42:16,019
I think it was a great achievement for everybody to do this transition to make a successful

932
00:42:16,059 --> 00:42:16,660
game afterwards.

933
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:22,275
And if we look at the brand, many people actually recognized Hitman Go as a true Hitman game,

934
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:26,499
even though it seemed so weird at the first time, at the first time we showed it, and people looked at it.

935
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:30,863
And I think we can also say that it managed to open up, maybe because of that,

936
00:42:31,684 --> 00:42:35,728
managed to open up the franchise to new audiences and bring people that maybe knew about Hitman,

937
00:42:35,748 --> 00:42:37,509
but had never played a Hitman game, and so on.

938
00:42:39,031 --> 00:42:40,352
As far as the platform is concerned...

939
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:43,989
We managed to ship on phone and tablets at the same time,

940
00:42:44,329 --> 00:42:45,710
even though in the beginning we were actually

941
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:48,332
just aiming for tablets, this was the mandate,

942
00:42:48,352 --> 00:42:50,013
and then we kind of shifted during production.

943
00:42:51,094 --> 00:42:52,735
And we were extremely lucky to get,

944
00:42:52,815 --> 00:42:55,317
and very happy also to get, Editor's Choice from Apple,

945
00:42:55,357 --> 00:42:57,558
and being very much featured by Apple and Google.

946
00:42:58,139 --> 00:42:59,660
So there was a great recognition for us

947
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,701
doing something specific for the platform

948
00:43:01,741 --> 00:43:02,602
and really working on that.

949
00:43:03,722 --> 00:43:10,024
And last but not least, the audience. As far as the audience is concerned, you might expect AAA fans being a very tough crowd,

950
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:13,665
especially if you announce that the next installment of your franchise is going to be on mobile games.

951
00:43:13,685 --> 00:43:15,346
And I guess we can look at it this way.

952
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:22,788
When we announced Hitman Go on February 13th in 2014, we just showed a screenshot and a little bit of text.

953
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:25,289
This is what NeoGAF looks like on that day.

954
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:27,609
So a guy saying, what the fuck is this?

955
00:43:29,136 --> 00:43:32,038
term-based strategy hitman just kill me now.

956
00:43:32,378 --> 00:43:34,960
Is this a little too early for April Fools?

957
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:36,582
Is this a fucking joke?

958
00:43:37,022 --> 00:43:38,223
47 deserves better than this.

959
00:43:38,323 --> 00:43:39,404
I guess this is a classic.

960
00:43:39,844 --> 00:43:41,866
But then, about a month, no sorry,

961
00:43:41,906 --> 00:43:43,467
two months later when we actually shipped the game

962
00:43:43,507 --> 00:43:44,768
and people got their hands on the game

963
00:43:44,808 --> 00:43:46,729
and even very like vocal people.

964
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:51,653
Same forum, different thread, but after the release,

965
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:53,314
it looked completely different.

966
00:43:53,414 --> 00:43:56,176
And I think it's kind of a very nice thing

967
00:43:56,196 --> 00:43:58,297
to look at today and to see how people actually

968
00:43:58,697 --> 00:44:00,278
got time to spend with the game

969
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,599
and actually changed their opinion on it.

970
00:44:01,659 --> 00:44:04,101
So we can say, going back to the slide,

971
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:08,684
very positive direction, reception by a very broad audience.

972
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:14,829
And we got great reviews and a lot of coverage from press and so forth.

973
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:16,651
And that's pretty much it.

974
00:44:17,451 --> 00:44:18,032
Thank you very much.

975
00:44:18,052 --> 00:44:26,879
Thanks.

976
00:44:26,899 --> 00:44:27,540
Sorry about that.

977
00:44:28,361 --> 00:44:28,961
So I guess there's a...

978
00:44:30,031 --> 00:44:31,973
A little bit of time, sorry that's very unprofessional.

979
00:44:31,993 --> 00:44:34,816
A little bit of time left for, actually 15 minutes left

980
00:44:34,876 --> 00:44:35,857
if there's any questions.

981
00:44:35,877 --> 00:44:38,159
There's microphones if you have questions

982
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,282
about the development or maybe the idea

983
00:44:40,322 --> 00:44:42,044
of the creative strategy that we applied to it.

984
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:47,009
Hey.

985
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:49,071
Hey, first of all, good job on that game.

986
00:44:49,131 --> 00:44:49,732
I really loved it.

987
00:44:51,368 --> 00:44:54,910
Were there any, did you set any constraints on the size of the grid that you were using?

988
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,893
And determine how much people were willing to scroll as far as, you know, looking at the level?

989
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,243
Yeah, actually this was a big part in developing the levels and the design in general.

990
00:45:05,263 --> 00:45:09,566
And I think it's two things, it's basically the size of the level but also the camera

991
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:10,166
as you mentioned.

992
00:45:10,927 --> 00:45:14,329
And we did a lot of iteration on the camera, actually we started off with a very free form,

993
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:18,272
like you could pan around, you could rotate and even zoom in and do a lot of controls.

994
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:24,056
But we felt that it was kind of like not slick enough and it wasn't intuitive enough for

995
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,158
people that maybe weren't experienced gamers.

996
00:45:26,898 --> 00:45:29,258
And so also in the beginning we had a lot bigger levels,

997
00:45:29,298 --> 00:45:31,359
right, we wanted to tell more of an environment,

998
00:45:31,379 --> 00:45:33,719
more of a story, but I guess in kind of a compromise

999
00:45:33,779 --> 00:45:36,460
between the platform, again the constraints of the platform,

1000
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,300
looking at that we decided to make these kind of

1001
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,020
bite-sized and more smaller levels.

1002
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:44,261
And I think even though you might find a couple of odd ones,

1003
00:45:44,321 --> 00:45:46,121
like there's probably levels still there

1004
00:45:46,161 --> 00:45:47,742
that are bigger than the average,

1005
00:45:48,522 --> 00:45:51,002
I think in general we ended up making these kind of

1006
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:53,143
like four by five kind of, that's probably

1007
00:45:53,163 --> 00:45:54,263
the average level that we built.

1008
00:45:58,611 --> 00:46:01,692
Hi, can you talk a little bit about the design,

1009
00:46:01,812 --> 00:46:03,853
how you designed the puzzles, like the actual

1010
00:46:03,893 --> 00:46:06,534
just making them hard logical puzzles to solve?

1011
00:46:07,134 --> 00:46:07,334
Sure.

1012
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:11,956
So we had this editor, I think the process

1013
00:46:11,996 --> 00:46:14,197
was very important because we didn't really

1014
00:46:14,237 --> 00:46:15,677
know much about this, there was not a game

1015
00:46:15,717 --> 00:46:17,118
that we could base ourselves off,

1016
00:46:17,158 --> 00:46:18,338
there was not a design that we knew

1017
00:46:18,399 --> 00:46:20,159
that we could just use and kind of reproduce.

1018
00:46:20,919 --> 00:46:23,600
And so I guess in the beginning with these

1019
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,281
kind of board game figurines, I think that was

1020
00:46:25,321 --> 00:46:26,562
kind of the first moment where we saw

1021
00:46:26,582 --> 00:46:27,802
that there was something cool there.

1022
00:46:28,362 --> 00:46:37,450
But then I think really the usability of the editors and the tools that we had helped us greatly in kind of just iterating and making a lot of these puzzles.

1023
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:45,616
And I mean it's safe to say we produced a lot of puzzles that were never used in the game and we tested also with playtests.

1024
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,960
And so I'm not sure if there's a strict logic

1025
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:51,061
to making these puzzles.

1026
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:52,182
There was a lot of trial and error,

1027
00:46:52,243 --> 00:46:54,385
and evaluating, especially in the beginning, right?

1028
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:56,467
But as development goes on,

1029
00:46:56,527 --> 00:46:58,589
I think you start to identify these kind of patterns.

1030
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:00,511
So there's, if you play the game,

1031
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:03,214
there's these kind of recurring patterns of puzzles.

1032
00:47:03,274 --> 00:47:04,175
Like there's this kind of.

1033
00:47:05,736 --> 00:47:09,660
idea of synchronizing characters.

1034
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,001
And so this is one thing that we started,

1035
00:47:11,041 --> 00:47:13,223
that we kind of realized and we started using

1036
00:47:13,243 --> 00:47:14,924
on levels going forward.

1037
00:47:14,944 --> 00:47:16,745
And there's kind of a couple of other different patterns

1038
00:47:16,766 --> 00:47:18,687
that we kind of emerged from the development

1039
00:47:18,707 --> 00:47:21,349
that we then used, but there's no like a black magic

1040
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:23,691
or a secret sauce to this, unfortunately.

1041
00:47:23,711 --> 00:47:27,554
I don't know who was next.

1042
00:47:27,775 --> 00:47:30,377
I'm curious if there were any discussions about

1043
00:47:31,621 --> 00:47:33,223
the business model and

1044
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:40,089
which fitted best with the project or if it just came as a design constraint from the very beginning or

1045
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:41,891
you had any discussions? Sure.

1046
00:47:42,491 --> 00:47:48,597
Obviously there were a lot of discussions about this. I think 2013, the summer when we started,

1047
00:47:49,297 --> 00:47:51,720
described us the summer of Candy Crush.

1048
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,002
Everybody was talking about premium at that point.

1049
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:56,963
and so were we, right? I think that's safe to say.

1050
00:47:56,983 --> 00:48:01,806
I think there was a couple of things that really got into the, that made this

1051
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:04,787
decision at the end. There was first of all, there was kind of the brand value,

1052
00:48:04,867 --> 00:48:06,648
right? We knew that people playing Hitman games...

1053
00:48:07,085 --> 00:48:08,467
they expect like a triple A product,

1054
00:48:08,487 --> 00:48:09,868
they pick Spock something that they pay for

1055
00:48:09,888 --> 00:48:11,910
and thought that might be a better transition

1056
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:13,611
to start off with a premium product.

1057
00:48:14,151 --> 00:48:15,653
But also I think the design that kind of

1058
00:48:16,433 --> 00:48:18,555
was built for the game, it really didn't lend itself

1059
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:19,696
for a free to play game, right?

1060
00:48:20,036 --> 00:48:21,918
And when you look at free to play kind of puzzle games,

1061
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:23,680
there's this compulsive nature to it,

1062
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,841
to many of them and our game was purely.

1063
00:48:26,322 --> 00:48:27,523
deterministic so to speak.

1064
00:48:27,563 --> 00:48:29,445
So our game was purely reproducible.

1065
00:48:29,825 --> 00:48:31,067
Every level, if you played it once,

1066
00:48:31,107 --> 00:48:32,288
you can replay it over and over again.

1067
00:48:32,308 --> 00:48:33,389
It's always the same solution.

1068
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:35,431
And so there's just this missing component

1069
00:48:35,471 --> 00:48:38,033
of randomness and luck that makes a lot

1070
00:48:38,053 --> 00:48:39,795
of these free-to-play puzzle games work.

1071
00:48:41,437 --> 00:48:43,639
And so at the end, it was really this kind of evaluation

1072
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:45,981
between different business models that made us stick

1073
00:48:46,081 --> 00:48:48,804
with, I guess, the original plan of making a premium game.

1074
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:55,222
Thanks Daniel, I loved the end-to-end journey you took us on there, thank you.

1075
00:48:55,362 --> 00:48:55,763
Thank you.

1076
00:48:56,745 --> 00:49:00,331
You made it sound effortless and I was just wondering if you could share any of those

1077
00:49:00,391 --> 00:49:03,557
moments where you were really banging your head against the table and you just thought

1078
00:49:03,597 --> 00:49:04,519
this isn't going to work.

1079
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,021
No, there was none of that.

1080
00:49:08,941 --> 00:49:11,542
No, obviously, I think looking at some of these scenarios,

1081
00:49:11,602 --> 00:49:14,322
especially the early days, I think

1082
00:49:14,342 --> 00:49:16,243
the story might be the biggest point.

1083
00:49:16,463 --> 00:49:18,563
We had very high expectations towards that,

1084
00:49:18,643 --> 00:49:22,224
and especially having a full studio of AAA developers.

1085
00:49:22,244 --> 00:49:24,825
A lot of them were actually into this whole storytelling

1086
00:49:24,885 --> 00:49:26,945
and making that really visible in a game.

1087
00:49:28,025 --> 00:49:30,066
And so we had probably too high expectations for that.

1088
00:49:30,106 --> 00:49:32,807
And I remember being very frustrated about realizing

1089
00:49:32,827 --> 00:49:35,027
that a lot of people didn't really get this kind of

1090
00:49:35,127 --> 00:49:37,388
continuity between levels and the story that we're trying

1091
00:49:37,428 --> 00:49:39,948
to tell with these little figurines going from one point

1092
00:49:40,008 --> 00:49:40,408
to another.

1093
00:49:41,388 --> 00:49:43,709
And I think it was hard for us to kind of accept that.

1094
00:49:44,209 --> 00:49:47,870
But I think at the end of the day, this is what helped us

1095
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:50,570
to really ship the game and also make the experience that

1096
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:51,251
it became today.

1097
00:49:57,173 --> 00:49:59,753
Hey, so, right here.

1098
00:49:59,933 --> 00:50:01,614
Sorry.

1099
00:50:01,754 --> 00:50:08,175
So you brought me into the Hitman universe, and because of that I'm not really familiar

1100
00:50:08,215 --> 00:50:10,535
with the previous Hitman game's sound design.

1101
00:50:12,555 --> 00:50:16,876
So I wanted to know what were some of the decisions behind the sound design.

1102
00:50:16,936 --> 00:50:18,216
I know it's kind of minimalistic.

1103
00:50:18,556 --> 00:50:22,877
There's I think one theme that you hear, like the Ave Maria theme.

1104
00:50:23,097 --> 00:50:23,717
Yes.

1105
00:50:23,737 --> 00:50:25,318
When you're about to assassinate your target.

1106
00:50:27,005 --> 00:50:31,091
I wanted to know why you guys didn't have other themes throughout other levels.

1107
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:32,433
What was the decision behind that?

1108
00:50:33,014 --> 00:50:37,440
So you're, I guess you're talking specifically about music, not just the, okay.

1109
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,662
And the sound effects as well.

1110
00:50:39,623 --> 00:50:41,065
Well I guess to talk about music.

1111
00:50:43,227 --> 00:50:45,989
we tried different things and I think it became very clear in the beginning that

1112
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:50,472
this is a very calculated and a very kind of brainy type of game and when you

1113
00:50:50,492 --> 00:50:53,474
look at these kind of experience you don't want to have music that just

1114
00:50:53,514 --> 00:50:58,237
distracts you too much and everything and so we were really sparse with it

1115
00:50:58,277 --> 00:50:58,837
from the get-go.

1116
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:07,165
While we had commissioned music, actually there's this kind of soundtrack that plays in the menus and that we also use throughout the levels as a build-up.

1117
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:14,413
And that worked pretty well. And then at some point we were really looking at different ways of bringing more of that Hitman identity into our game.

1118
00:51:14,793 --> 00:51:18,237
And then having this kind of composition actually always works like this.

1119
00:51:19,899 --> 00:51:22,982
In a set of levels there's always two guys you have to assassinate.

1120
00:51:24,123 --> 00:51:29,326
two levels before that, there's a little bit of a change in music pace, and then the one before that, it really picks up.

1121
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:36,311
And then the last one, where you actually get to assassinate, there's this theme, Ave Maria, right, that was used by Schubert, that was used by

1122
00:51:37,092 --> 00:51:42,155
the IO Interactive when they worked on other hit mangas before. So it really was, for us, was a way to connect with the audience

1123
00:51:42,195 --> 00:51:44,636
again, and I think a lot of people recognized and really appreciated that.

1124
00:51:45,317 --> 00:51:50,782
And maybe about sound design, I think there was this discussion really early on how literal

1125
00:51:50,822 --> 00:51:51,703
we wanted to be.

1126
00:51:51,763 --> 00:51:56,447
We had this kind of board game idea, aesthetics and everything, so it was very obvious, it

1127
00:51:56,487 --> 00:52:00,550
could have been very obvious to say, oh, let's make these sliding pieces moving back and

1128
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:00,871
forth.

1129
00:52:01,671 --> 00:52:05,635
But I think James, our sound designer, had kind of great ideas about how to maybe break

1130
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:06,195
that a little bit.

1131
00:52:06,555 --> 00:52:08,816
And so I think it became this very interesting blend

1132
00:52:08,896 --> 00:52:11,818
between putting sounds on something that you expect,

1133
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,458
but also I think there's sounds in there

1134
00:52:13,478 --> 00:52:17,180
that don't make any sense, quote unquote.

1135
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,781
For example, like when you throw a distraction,

1136
00:52:19,801 --> 00:52:22,282
you actually hear a guy being, making a sound like this.

1137
00:52:22,322 --> 00:52:23,963
So I think it is this kind of charming mix

1138
00:52:24,843 --> 00:52:26,844
of different effects that we ended up

1139
00:52:26,884 --> 00:52:27,724
being really happy with.

1140
00:52:28,585 --> 00:52:28,825
Thank you.

1141
00:52:30,786 --> 00:52:31,406
Thanks for your talk.

1142
00:52:31,726 --> 00:52:33,147
One of the really interesting.

1143
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:39,132
player constraints in Hitman Go is the fact that you need to make a physical move each turn.

1144
00:52:39,532 --> 00:52:43,655
You need to move to another spot. I was wondering if that's something that you locked in on really early,

1145
00:52:44,315 --> 00:52:48,237
or if you did experiments with a weight or something or anything like that.

1146
00:52:48,477 --> 00:52:52,442
This is a good question because this came up during development all over and over again.

1147
00:52:53,262 --> 00:52:56,246
And so there was almost like these kind of two camps in our team.

1148
00:52:56,266 --> 00:53:01,551
So people that believed that there had to be this kind of, I guess inspired by classic Hitman games,

1149
00:53:02,472 --> 00:53:07,037
a feature where you had to wait, where you had to be able to wait and kind of just have the situation go on.

1150
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:15,012
And on the other hand, we have the learning that if you make puzzles, you have to make them really tight.

1151
00:53:16,233 --> 00:53:20,294
Antoine, actually, I'm a technical director, had this really good analogy.

1152
00:53:20,334 --> 00:53:25,195
It's like building a set of IKEA furniture and then at the end having a screw that's left over.

1153
00:53:25,255 --> 00:53:27,156
It's a very unsatisfying process, right?

1154
00:53:27,196 --> 00:53:29,816
And I think making these puzzles very tight so that you...

1155
00:53:31,657 --> 00:53:34,419
feel constrained again, I guess, in that sense,

1156
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:37,261
and don't have the option to kind of just make everything

1157
00:53:37,281 --> 00:53:39,662
go back and forth was kind of the obvious choice.

1158
00:53:39,682 --> 00:53:41,924
And I guess, especially with the game design,

1159
00:53:41,984 --> 00:53:43,044
if you've played the game, there's this,

1160
00:53:43,485 --> 00:53:45,646
as I said before, this is kind of synchronous patterns,

1161
00:53:45,706 --> 00:53:48,708
right, so if I'm on an odd node,

1162
00:53:48,748 --> 00:53:50,429
then all the enemies that are on even nodes,

1163
00:53:50,489 --> 00:53:53,031
I can take them out and so forth, and vice versa.

1164
00:53:53,171 --> 00:53:56,253
And this was pretty much the foundation of the game design,

1165
00:53:56,273 --> 00:53:56,773
and by having

1166
00:53:57,494 --> 00:54:04,055
By allowing people to wait on a spot, we basically just would have thrown out this design as a whole, and so we decided to stick with it.

1167
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:05,636
Absolutely. Thank you.

1168
00:54:07,356 --> 00:54:18,939
Hi, I was just curious about the, if you have a comparison, profit-wise, for a mobile game, which you're charging $5 for, versus making console games, where you're charging $50.

1169
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:21,971
Sorry, I'm not sure I understood the question.

1170
00:54:22,191 --> 00:54:23,533
Sorry, the mic sounds a little weird.

1171
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,095
I'm trying, I'm curious.

1172
00:54:26,356 --> 00:54:27,036
Give me my phone.

1173
00:54:29,439 --> 00:54:31,241
I'm just curious about the profitability

1174
00:54:31,641 --> 00:54:34,584
of when you're a mobile game versus a console game,

1175
00:54:34,885 --> 00:54:38,829
where you're charging $5 for a mobile game versus how much

1176
00:54:38,849 --> 00:54:39,369
you would charge $50 for a.

1177
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:52,827
Okay, I'm not sure I can, I'm really the person to talk about that to be honest, and also I think this being a project of like a publicly traded company, I'm not sure I can really disclose any information.

1178
00:54:53,767 --> 00:55:03,230
Again, I worked on this AAA product before, but I wasn't really involved in any of the kind of financial background in it, so I guess you would have to ask the people being involved.

1179
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:05,322
I guess in charge of that too.

1180
00:55:05,462 --> 00:55:08,483
Would you say the production's a lot simpler for a mobile game?

1181
00:55:09,544 --> 00:55:13,705
I think simple is maybe a way you can put it, I think maybe thinking back about the

1182
00:55:13,745 --> 00:55:17,127
slide I had in the beginning where we said that mobile games are easy to make because

1183
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,328
they're kind of like a dumbed down version of triple A games.

1184
00:55:21,264 --> 00:55:33,447
I don't think it is that way, but when you look at, I guess, production constraints and when you look at scope projects on mobile, you can get away, quote-unquote, much easier with smaller scope games, right?

1185
00:55:33,487 --> 00:55:38,268
Because that's what people kind of want, also in many cases, bite-sized experiences.

1186
00:55:38,328 --> 00:55:43,129
And so, yeah, I guess you can make cheaper mobile games in general than console games.

1187
00:55:43,529 --> 00:55:44,170
Okay, thank you.

1188
00:55:46,651 --> 00:55:46,871
Hi.

1189
00:55:47,131 --> 00:55:50,094
We are running out of time here, so here's the last question.

1190
00:55:50,954 --> 00:55:53,076
During the presentation, you talked about,

1191
00:55:53,716 --> 00:55:56,178
you come up with a conclusion that for mobile,

1192
00:55:56,198 --> 00:55:58,560
there are only two kinds of games that are worth making.

1193
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,542
One is fast-paced, short-section kind of game,

1194
00:56:01,622 --> 00:56:03,203
and one is turn-based.

1195
00:56:03,684 --> 00:56:05,605
And I'm curious, how did you guys come up

1196
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:06,506
with that conclusion?

1197
00:56:08,494 --> 00:56:12,698
I don't know, honestly, that was just a random thought that I had, and I think this is really

1198
00:56:12,738 --> 00:56:17,983
the idea of this underlying concept of being a bit stupid every once in a while and not

1199
00:56:18,003 --> 00:56:19,004
being afraid of doing so.

1200
00:56:20,325 --> 00:56:24,209
I was pretty sure this was an amazing idea and I was pretty sure this was the way you

1201
00:56:24,229 --> 00:56:26,291
make mobile games, you make successful mobile games.

1202
00:56:26,731 --> 00:56:31,236
Obviously today we know there's a lot of other mobile games that are not falling into either

1203
00:56:31,276 --> 00:56:31,976
of that category.

1204
00:56:32,417 --> 00:56:35,219
but I think again at that point all we needed

1205
00:56:35,279 --> 00:56:37,660
was an initial spark, something to actually start working

1206
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:40,222
and I can't tell you where it came from originally,

1207
00:56:40,262 --> 00:56:41,883
maybe some sort of an article that I read

1208
00:56:41,943 --> 00:56:43,164
or just a random thought I had,

1209
00:56:43,224 --> 00:56:44,906
but I guess that's how it started.

1210
00:56:46,447 --> 00:56:47,027
Thank you very much.
