1
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:18,364
I would like to thank you to come here to my little talk about how not to create textures

2
00:00:18,464 --> 00:00:19,165
for VFX.

3
00:00:20,777 --> 00:00:22,118
I'm Simon Trumpler, he, him.

4
00:00:22,578 --> 00:00:24,199
And up there, you can see some games

5
00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:25,820
I had the privilege working on.

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,521
And here is one of my very first effects

7
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:31,583
I made for a game at some point, long time ago.

8
00:00:32,063 --> 00:00:34,104
And here are some effects I did recently.

9
00:00:34,124 --> 00:00:38,086
Yeah, and now I would like to invite you

10
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:39,607
to a little vacation on an island,

11
00:00:39,667 --> 00:00:43,568
which I designed like the VFX paradise, okay?

12
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:47,330
So this is how I imagined the paradise for VFX artists.

13
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:51,667
Explosions all the time, splashes all the time, that's what we like.

14
00:00:52,328 --> 00:01:01,210
And I created this project just for this GDC to have a base for a talk, to talk about some textures.

15
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:06,711
And textures which I think are the most commonly types you will find in VFX.

16
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:12,273
Like some splashes, some explosions, some water, some foam, and so on and so on.

17
00:01:13,093 --> 00:01:13,353
But...

18
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:18,373
Before we come to that, I would like to give some expectation management.

19
00:01:19,354 --> 00:01:23,576
When you search for resources how to create textures for effects,

20
00:01:24,016 --> 00:01:25,617
then you will find not much.

21
00:01:26,077 --> 00:01:29,139
But if you find something, it will be stylized.

22
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:32,740
And this is why I will not focus so much on this today.

23
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:35,402
Because you can see there are some names there.

24
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:37,603
If you Google them, you will find amazing resources.

25
00:01:38,383 --> 00:01:42,285
And I will focus a little more on semi-realistic effects.

26
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:43,526
And...

27
00:01:44,845 --> 00:01:46,766
Yeah, that's what I will do.

28
00:01:47,547 --> 00:01:50,348
And I will also not focus on version zero.

29
00:01:50,388 --> 00:01:52,649
Version zero is usually a version

30
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:55,691
where you maybe not even use the text at all,

31
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:58,132
you just communicate gameplay usually.

32
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,782
This is what I will not focus on today.

33
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:04,664
I will also not focus on the final polished version

34
00:02:04,684 --> 00:02:07,967
where you had a lot of time to spend into your textures.

35
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:10,830
I will focus on a version which I call GE,

36
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,931
stands for good enough.

37
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:15,374
And the idea is that you get to this version

38
00:02:15,454 --> 00:02:17,856
as fast as possible, but it should look nice.

39
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:20,098
Not amazing, but nice.

40
00:02:20,578 --> 00:02:24,121
So that you, for example, also see the scale of the explosion

41
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:27,264
because it has some detail or the effect in general.

42
00:02:28,122 --> 00:02:30,363
And it should be a base for the discussion

43
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,763
with, for example, art direction,

44
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:34,965
that you can say, hey, shall we iterate more

45
00:02:35,145 --> 00:02:36,506
about the style of the effect,

46
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:38,666
or can we go into the polishing phase?

47
00:02:38,706 --> 00:02:41,548
So this is what I would like to focus on today.

48
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:45,209
And as far to my knowledge,

49
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:47,590
this is maybe the first or one of the first talks

50
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,672
focusing very specific on how to create textures for VFX.

51
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:54,233
Let's start at the basics, okay?

52
00:02:54,886 --> 00:02:59,087
So the most common texture types for VFX artists are sprites.

53
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,109
And this is just a texture on a little particle.

54
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:04,169
So nothing special here.

55
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:06,410
But we have also sprite sheets, which

56
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,051
is just a collection of sprites on one texture.

57
00:03:09,091 --> 00:03:11,632
And the particle system will choose one randomly just

58
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:12,472
for some variation.

59
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:19,124
And then we have flipbooks, which is basically just a little movie running on a particle.

60
00:03:19,865 --> 00:03:25,210
And then we have volumetric textures, which is basically slices of simulations or objects.

61
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:28,756
stored into a volumetric texture, and then you can do some magic with that.

62
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:34,199
But to be honest, I never used one. So I will not focus more on this topic,

63
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:41,183
but I wanted to have the list complete. And the most common use cases for textures are,

64
00:03:41,343 --> 00:03:44,765
OK, color. Surprise, we have a color texture and put it on our particle.

65
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:50,889
We also have masks, and these masks come usually, at least one mask as an alpha in your color

66
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:52,349
texture to mask out these shapes.

67
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:58,819
But a mask can also be a grayscale image just separately stored

68
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,589
and you can use a shader to, I don't know, mask out your other textures if you want to.

69
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:08,014
And another grayscale mask we have.

70
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,252
is or can be used for erosion.

71
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:14,133
And you can see that my little particles fade out

72
00:04:14,193 --> 00:04:15,634
in a bit more interesting way

73
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:19,256
than just opacity low and down, right?

74
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:23,058
And then we have lookup textures,

75
00:04:23,158 --> 00:04:26,579
which are basically just little color gradients,

76
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,121
and they are used to colorize a grayscale map.

77
00:04:30,316 --> 00:04:36,558
And here you see how I colorized my little erosion map from before with different colors, and it's just a very nice way of,

78
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:42,640
with not many resources, colorize something very nicely.

79
00:04:44,521 --> 00:04:52,444
And of course vector maps, which are usually used to distort your UVs, so you get a little bit of extra motion into your particle.

80
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:58,091
So, and now let's go about how to create these textures,

81
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,352
because this is what we are talking about today.

82
00:05:01,852 --> 00:05:04,973
There are four ways of creating textures for VFX,

83
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:06,253
at least to my knowledge.

84
00:05:06,914 --> 00:05:08,054
The first one is handmade.

85
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,674
You can paint it, you can use photos.

86
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,916
You can use procedural tools like Substance

87
00:05:14,996 --> 00:05:16,916
or simple tools which are specifically made

88
00:05:16,956 --> 00:05:18,357
to create warm type of texture.

89
00:05:19,717 --> 00:05:20,897
Or you can simulate something.

90
00:05:21,392 --> 00:05:24,195
like an explosion for example, and then bake this into a texture.

91
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:27,859
Usually done with Houdini or Blender, and nowadays

92
00:05:28,179 --> 00:05:32,163
Ambergen, which is a software which can almost simulate in real time.

93
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:36,913
And now on the next slide, I will have colorized these words

94
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:39,155
depending on how quick it is to do.

95
00:05:39,955 --> 00:05:41,956
So here you see, and I also have little emojis.

96
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:44,838
So as you can see, photo bashing and simple tools

97
00:05:44,898 --> 00:05:45,759
are the fastest way.

98
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:48,340
Then we have something in the middle ground

99
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,941
with painting and substance designer,

100
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,023
depending of course, what you want.

101
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:55,124
If you just use substance to store out some noises,

102
00:05:55,545 --> 00:05:57,766
that's a bit quicker than doing a realistic fire

103
00:05:57,826 --> 00:05:58,326
from scratch.

104
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:02,609
And learning simulation.

105
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:09,307
takes forever. I took weeks to follow this one course for learning how to do pyro.

106
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:14,149
Doing the simulation itself also takes forever because it's so complicated and then the rendering

107
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:19,711
also takes forever. So this will be not any more part of this talk because it just takes

108
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:22,551
long and we want to achieve a good enough version quick.

109
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:28,261
Um, but Embergen sneaks a little bit in between because it's real time

110
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:32,544
simulation and I did not use Embergen before, but for this talk, I did a little

111
00:06:32,624 --> 00:06:32,924
test.

112
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:38,728
I downloaded it and then I saw what I could get out of it as quick as possible.

113
00:06:39,008 --> 00:06:39,909
And here are the results.

114
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:45,332
So after 50 minutes of Embergen, I, uh, rendered out these little flip books.

115
00:06:45,532 --> 00:06:47,814
And that's not because I'm a genius.

116
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,817
It's because Embergen comes with presets and I think it's.

117
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:57,637
60 or 70 or something like that and you can just load them in and render them out and it's very nice

118
00:06:57,697 --> 00:06:59,578
And I think when you take a day of work

119
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:02,280
You can get a very nice base

120
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,542
For your VFX texture library out of that

121
00:07:06,102 --> 00:07:10,265
But it's important to mention you are not allowed to do that when you only have the demo version

122
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,166
You should buy a license then it's okay

123
00:07:13,707 --> 00:07:16,770
But there's one way which is even faster than all of them

124
00:07:17,843 --> 00:07:20,384
And this is, by the way, also one of the reasons

125
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:22,604
why my talk is how to not create textures,

126
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:24,965
because you use existing textures.

127
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,566
So, of course, it's very fast if you use something existing,

128
00:07:29,326 --> 00:07:30,587
like texture packs or brushes,

129
00:07:31,747 --> 00:07:34,028
than when you do everything by yourself.

130
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:39,490
All of these things, like these different texture types,

131
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,570
these use cases, and also these different ways

132
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,392
of creating things can sometimes be a bit overwhelming.

133
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:47,292
And it was important for me to share.

134
00:07:48,113 --> 00:07:51,994
that I feel and felt like that often.

135
00:07:52,795 --> 00:07:54,335
And in preparation of this talk,

136
00:07:54,535 --> 00:07:56,155
I spoke with many other professionals

137
00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:57,556
and they told me all the same.

138
00:07:57,896 --> 00:07:59,656
Nobody was like, oh yeah, it's super easy for me.

139
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:01,637
They all were like, oh yeah, sometimes I feel like,

140
00:08:01,657 --> 00:08:04,117
whew, especially when there is no texture at all

141
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:05,798
already in the project.

142
00:08:05,938 --> 00:08:07,178
So I wanted to share this.

143
00:08:07,358 --> 00:08:07,658
If you...

144
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:11,827
feel sometimes like that, it's okay, and you are not alone.

145
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:14,171
And I hope with this talk,

146
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:15,754
maybe I can give you some inspirations

147
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:16,916
to overcome this hurdle

148
00:08:17,056 --> 00:08:20,181
or give you some creative ways of creating textures.

149
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:26,808
Again, normally we would be very happy to see them now,

150
00:08:26,828 --> 00:08:28,810
but unfortunately I need to be in this

151
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,633
a little bit more melancholic mood for this slide

152
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:34,915
because I would like to speak about,

153
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:37,077
and this is the second reason why this talk is called

154
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:38,818
how not to create textures for Vuex,

155
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,260
because they have some things in my mind

156
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:44,443
blocking me from creating good textures.

157
00:08:45,463 --> 00:08:49,246
And maybe if you want, you can give me a quick hand sign if.

158
00:08:49,805 --> 00:08:51,606
This was happens there on the screen,

159
00:08:51,646 --> 00:08:53,227
there will be a quote or a sentence.

160
00:08:54,287 --> 00:08:56,368
If you had this thought in your past,

161
00:08:56,428 --> 00:08:58,309
or maybe you even think nowadays like that.

162
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,490
Using photos is cheating.

163
00:09:01,071 --> 00:09:03,952
So I raise my hand because I thought like that.

164
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,713
And okay, nobody here, okay, I want to...

165
00:09:07,934 --> 00:09:10,075
Okay, maybe 50% or maybe 40.

166
00:09:10,255 --> 00:09:12,216
Okay, that's good to hear that I'm not alone.

167
00:09:12,576 --> 00:09:12,836
Because...

168
00:09:14,668 --> 00:09:18,511
I don't know where this was coming from, but for some reason I had this thought in my head.

169
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:24,936
And I also know that in concept art areas, you can hear that often that people, especially,

170
00:09:24,956 --> 00:09:28,979
I don't know, maybe beginners or maybe people who don't do concept art so long, they are like,

171
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,901
oh man, you don't paint every pixel by yourself. That's cheating.

172
00:09:32,582 --> 00:09:35,384
And here is my little journey of not using textures.

173
00:09:37,354 --> 00:09:43,356
Two textures of my one of my earliest textures I did for VFX for a game at some point. It's a long time ago

174
00:09:43,456 --> 00:09:44,636
I didn't know what I was doing

175
00:09:45,596 --> 00:09:48,377
And of course I didn't use textures, but later for a project

176
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:55,099
I continued doing textures and you could maybe say okay. These are maybe nice for a

177
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:56,679
stylized game

178
00:09:57,539 --> 00:09:59,800
Unfortunately, this was a semi realistic game

179
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,542
But I was under this impression. Oh, no, I can't use textures and I have to paint everything by myself

180
00:10:06,182 --> 00:10:08,803
And then finally later, at some point at the project,

181
00:10:08,883 --> 00:10:11,165
I finally started using some photos.

182
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:14,547
And I hope we can agree that these textures on the right

183
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:16,509
look a little bit better, a little bit more detailed,

184
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,830
just a little bit more realistic.

185
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:21,712
And it took me a long time to overcome this hurdle.

186
00:10:22,613 --> 00:10:25,655
But important, do not just use any texture

187
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:26,236
from the internet.

188
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:28,597
Don't go to Google and take everything.

189
00:10:28,957 --> 00:10:31,259
You need to check out the FAQ or the license.

190
00:10:31,676 --> 00:10:34,540
And just as an example, textjust.com, very good.

191
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:37,646
Yes, you can use it for commercial projects

192
00:10:38,006 --> 00:10:39,148
and most important at the bottom.

193
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:41,421
You do not need to mention our website.

194
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:45,182
This is important because you find many free resources

195
00:10:45,282 --> 00:10:48,502
in the internet, but most of them will require you

196
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:51,323
to attribute to author, which is totally fine, of course,

197
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:53,823
especially when you have maybe a little indie game

198
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:56,224
or something, but it is unpractical.

199
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:58,824
If you go to your producer at the end of Call of Duty

200
00:10:59,264 --> 00:11:01,225
and say, hey, I have this list of 50 people.

201
00:11:01,305 --> 00:11:02,725
Could you please add them to the credits

202
00:11:02,805 --> 00:11:04,745
because I used some brushes and textures for them.

203
00:11:05,245 --> 00:11:09,306
This is, they will not be delighted about it.

204
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:11,851
At the producer, I mean. I mean the people would.

205
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:15,995
And here's an example for being careful.

206
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:21,760
The ArtStation standard license allows only one commercial project and up to 2,000 sales,

207
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,364
which is not that much if we think about the scale of a call of duty or something.

208
00:11:25,964 --> 00:11:30,549
So usually on ArtStation you have to buy the extended license,

209
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:34,072
but sometimes this is not offered by the creator.

210
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:35,253
So be careful about this.

211
00:11:37,783 --> 00:11:40,965
And there's another reason I got blocked by.

212
00:11:40,985 --> 00:11:44,447
I had in my mind another weird thing,

213
00:11:44,827 --> 00:11:48,650
using third party assets is cheating, okay?

214
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,012
What I had in my head, sorry,

215
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:56,195
is that an artist, a real artist,

216
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:57,696
creates everything from scratch.

217
00:11:59,117 --> 00:12:01,458
And using, I don't know, texture packs

218
00:12:01,478 --> 00:12:02,659
from someone else is cheating.

219
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:06,641
And maybe this is something artists have in general,

220
00:12:06,721 --> 00:12:07,062
I don't know.

221
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,833
But I think it's important to mention that we are not artists

222
00:12:11,453 --> 00:12:12,834
which need a kiss from the muse,

223
00:12:12,935 --> 00:12:14,636
and then we start creating something.

224
00:12:15,196 --> 00:12:18,159
We are production artists, so we should use every tool

225
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:20,541
we can get to make things as fast as possible.

226
00:12:21,662 --> 00:12:26,205
And yeah, as mentioned, sometimes I have this now today,

227
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:28,547
even so this is not something from the past.

228
00:12:28,728 --> 00:12:32,090
And if you also struggle with that,

229
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,192
if you also have this artist brain sometimes saying,

230
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:35,873
no, no, no, I want to create everything from scratch,

231
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:39,434
Here come my top six solutions to calm your artist brain down.

232
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:41,995
So first, it is fast.

233
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:45,176
It is very fast to use textures from someone else,

234
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:46,016
if you are allowed to.

235
00:12:46,336 --> 00:12:49,477
But don't worry, there's enough work to be done.

236
00:12:49,857 --> 00:12:52,498
Here, for example, is a free flipbook from Unity,

237
00:12:52,578 --> 00:12:53,978
which you can use for your project.

238
00:12:54,318 --> 00:12:57,719
But we see, I mean, it looks nice, but it's a bit stuttery.

239
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:01,640
And here is what I made out of it for this project

240
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,781
I showed you before.

241
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:07,853
To improve it a little bit, I had to adjust the color curve, the size curve,

242
00:13:08,214 --> 00:13:12,196
enable frame blending in the particle system so that it's not as stuttery as before.

243
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,801
And most important, I animate the frame rate of the flipbook

244
00:13:16,821 --> 00:13:19,582
so that it moves fast at the beginning and slow at the end.

245
00:13:19,762 --> 00:13:22,463
Like when the smoke calms down because of air friction,

246
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:24,304
this is what I'm achieving with that.

247
00:13:24,724 --> 00:13:25,865
And this is just one particle.

248
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:27,986
You have now to set up the whole explosion

249
00:13:28,006 --> 00:13:29,986
with many particles and then add other elements

250
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:34,208
like sprites, sparkles and debris and stuff like that.

251
00:13:34,408 --> 00:13:37,529
So there's enough work for you to do.

252
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:40,550
Don't worry, just using third-party assets

253
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,971
does not make you without work.

254
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,901
Sometimes I had this in my mind,

255
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:46,582
oh yeah, I would like to use this flipbook,

256
00:13:46,602 --> 00:13:47,663
but there is some data missing.

257
00:13:47,944 --> 00:13:50,626
For example, this flipbook is just lit from one side,

258
00:13:50,686 --> 00:13:53,208
but I want to have a dynamic lighting.

259
00:13:53,608 --> 00:13:55,810
But here I need to calm myself down and say,

260
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,492
hey, we want to have a good enough version.

261
00:13:58,072 --> 00:13:59,233
Must not be super polished.

262
00:13:59,253 --> 00:14:01,075
So it's okay to have just static lighting.

263
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:04,137
Or something, maybe you have no,

264
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:06,860
you have this flipbook which stutters a little bit,

265
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,902
and you would like to have these perfect motion vectors

266
00:14:09,942 --> 00:14:11,123
to blend perfectly.

267
00:14:11,902 --> 00:14:13,423
between the frames but you don't have them

268
00:14:13,443 --> 00:14:14,704
and you don't know about slate

269
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:16,805
and it can create them for you pretty easily,

270
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:19,767
then maybe it is enough to just enable frame blending

271
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:20,828
in the particle system.

272
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:23,490
It's not perfect, but it's good enough.

273
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:31,930
And maybe some people are like, yeah, I could imagine using third-party libraries,

274
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,391
but I'm working in stylized effects and these are all realistic.

275
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,592
But here's a small example of what you can do.

276
00:14:38,852 --> 00:14:41,572
I mean, it's not perfect. It was just quickly drawn by me,

277
00:14:41,592 --> 00:14:45,273
but I used a realistic or semi-realistic reference

278
00:14:46,393 --> 00:14:48,594
and draw on top to make something stylized.

279
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,094
So this is also maybe a little inspiration for you.

280
00:14:53,094 --> 00:14:53,955
And also in...

281
00:14:54,552 --> 00:14:56,353
important when you go into a company,

282
00:14:56,473 --> 00:14:58,534
usually you have a team with other fellow artists

283
00:14:58,594 --> 00:15:01,655
and they may be created already to some textures before you.

284
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:04,216
And of course you will reuse them if possible.

285
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:06,617
Why should you do a 20th explosion

286
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:09,498
if there are 19 perfectly usable in the project?

287
00:15:09,538 --> 00:15:13,040
So you will use third party assets anyway,

288
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,861
and nothing speaks against taking some out of the internet

289
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:17,082
if you are allowed to, of course.

290
00:15:19,343 --> 00:15:22,764
And then it really helps to find your art direction.

291
00:15:23,353 --> 00:15:25,734
On the left, you see my little explosion, which I used.

292
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:27,015
This is the Unity flipbook.

293
00:15:27,215 --> 00:15:29,075
And on the right, I just used a different flipbook

294
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:29,816
from the same pack.

295
00:15:29,876 --> 00:15:32,076
And I like the left one more because you

296
00:15:32,116 --> 00:15:33,677
have a nicer silhouette, right?

297
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:35,077
The right one is a bit rounder.

298
00:15:35,798 --> 00:15:38,739
And now that I know this, if I should go and do

299
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:41,019
my own explosion now or simulation,

300
00:15:41,359 --> 00:15:42,180
I know what to look for.

301
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,660
And this is very valuable.

302
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,581
Finding out what you want and what you like

303
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:47,421
takes usually a lot of amount of time.

304
00:15:47,461 --> 00:15:51,043
And these assets can help you to find out what you like quicker.

305
00:15:52,043 --> 00:15:54,744
And I already spoiled it a little bit, this is the most important thing.

306
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:58,787
If your artist brain is like, oh no, I don't want to use assets from someone else,

307
00:15:58,807 --> 00:16:02,609
then you can tell it, hey, we just use it now and maybe if there's time,

308
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:07,292
we can make our own simulation or effect or explosion later.

309
00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:12,294
And now finally, let's talk about practical stuff, okay?

310
00:16:12,535 --> 00:16:13,415
All this theory.

311
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:18,818
So here's this project again, you can see some effects going on there.

312
00:16:20,032 --> 00:16:23,993
And these are the most important textures I created for this project.

313
00:16:24,033 --> 00:16:28,935
And I will go with you on a little journey and explain how those are created.

314
00:16:30,695 --> 00:16:32,616
First, a little general guide.

315
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:37,217
If you are unsure what would be a good way to create a texture,

316
00:16:37,257 --> 00:16:38,958
first ask yourself, do you need a texture?

317
00:16:39,758 --> 00:16:41,139
If no, then enjoy life.

318
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,980
And if yes, then ask yourself, is there a third-party asset you can use?

319
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,300
And if so, use it.

320
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,181
In my case, the explosion.

321
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:53,920
If there's no third party asset, then you can ask yourself,

322
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,921
hey, is there a simple tool

323
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:56,483
which generates this texture for me?

324
00:16:57,445 --> 00:16:58,306
And if so, use it.

325
00:16:58,386 --> 00:17:00,209
In my case, this will be the little cloud

326
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:02,131
which ran top of my island.

327
00:17:04,313 --> 00:17:07,217
And if no, then ask yourself if it's tileable.

328
00:17:07,277 --> 00:17:08,639
Is it a tileable texture?

329
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,761
And if so, you can use Substance Designer.

330
00:17:10,841 --> 00:17:12,343
Of course, you can also use Photoshop,

331
00:17:12,383 --> 00:17:15,427
but in Substance it's just a little bit faster, more convenient.

332
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:20,913
And if the texture is more unique, then I usually prefer Photoshop or Krita.

333
00:17:21,054 --> 00:17:23,697
And that's my little guide here.

334
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:26,845
And now let's talk about the explosion.

335
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,268
Um, yeah, uh, spoiler.

336
00:17:29,308 --> 00:17:36,795
I just used explosion from unity flip books, but I want to mention that, um, yeah, these are CC zero, so you can use them for whatever you want.

337
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,038
And they offer way more than just some explosion.

338
00:17:39,078 --> 00:17:40,960
They also have some nice flames and some smoke.

339
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:46,405
Uh, and you find whenever I mentioned something here, by the way, you will find a source down there in the.

340
00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:55,847
corner. Embergen also offers some free VDBs and also keep in mind that Unity and Unreal offer both

341
00:17:56,488 --> 00:18:01,031
usually big asset packs which you can use if you use the respective engine and just the Paragon

342
00:18:01,091 --> 00:18:07,695
assets alone contain a huge load of amazing VFX assets or assets in general.

343
00:18:09,147 --> 00:18:10,928
Okay, that's already for the explosion.

344
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:15,089
Now I would like to talk about this background thing,

345
00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:17,049
which is not necessarily a VFX texture,

346
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:18,890
but I want to cover some basics in there,

347
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:21,250
so I included it here in this talk.

348
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,111
First, we look at a reference, of course.

349
00:18:23,451 --> 00:18:27,792
I noticed that these galaxies

350
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:30,553
are basically very soft gradients,

351
00:18:30,853 --> 00:18:32,933
and then a lot of high-frequency noise on top.

352
00:18:35,172 --> 00:18:39,737
And then, and this is important, I wish someone would have told this to me like, I don't know, 10 years ago.

353
00:18:40,438 --> 00:18:44,463
Create your source files always in a big format, meaning, big format.

354
00:18:44,984 --> 00:18:50,010
And then set it in your engine to the size you actually need.

355
00:18:52,554 --> 00:18:53,435
This is future proof.

356
00:18:53,828 --> 00:18:55,128
if production comes and says,

357
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,609
hey, we make a high-res version of our game,

358
00:18:57,689 --> 00:18:59,909
or we make a 4K version or a 4K patch,

359
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:01,510
then the only thing you have to do

360
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:03,030
is increase these numbers and you are done.

361
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,671
You do not want to repaint all your textures

362
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:08,091
because you created them into small source files,

363
00:19:08,492 --> 00:19:10,792
like I did a while ago.

364
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:15,193
And this does not mean that I ask you

365
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:16,714
to paint all these little details,

366
00:19:16,754 --> 00:19:18,594
which at the end nobody will see, okay?

367
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:23,375
But if you, oh no, no, what did I do?

368
00:19:25,172 --> 00:19:25,933
My laptop is...

369
00:19:27,214 --> 00:19:28,955
Something happened? I am not sure what happened.

370
00:19:30,556 --> 00:19:31,437
Did I press something?

371
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:32,898
Now it's good?

372
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:33,599
It's good, okay.

373
00:19:33,959 --> 00:19:37,922
So this does not mean that you paint all these details,

374
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:39,363
but the workflow and the time,

375
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:42,045
the time investment is the same

376
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,686
if you use a big brush, for example,

377
00:19:43,726 --> 00:19:45,648
or photos on a big canvas,

378
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:47,369
or if you use a smaller version

379
00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:48,850
of the same brush on a small canvas.

380
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,372
So it's exactly the same work for you as an artist,

381
00:19:51,412 --> 00:19:53,674
but the one version on the left is future-proof

382
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,134
and the other...

383
00:19:54,716 --> 00:20:00,718
is not. And I have a very nice example for that. In Baldur's Gate 3, there are these ash particles

384
00:20:00,858 --> 00:20:04,980
flying in the air and it can come really close to the camera, which I really like. And I tell you,

385
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:10,422
if I would have painted this a while ago, because of in my head an ash particle is something very

386
00:20:10,482 --> 00:20:17,124
small. So I would have created a 32 by 32 texture and call it a day. But this would then be just a

387
00:20:17,164 --> 00:20:20,386
blurry blob in front of the camera. Okay, so yeah.

388
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,913
This is something I learned pretty late in my career actually.

389
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:29,337
Brushes. Okay, it's no surprise to use brushes.

390
00:20:29,577 --> 00:20:31,879
That's, wow, Simon, that's crazy.

391
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:37,344
But actually I found it really hard to find good brushes for VFX which you are allowed to use.

392
00:20:37,624 --> 00:20:40,667
There are some websites out there with a lot of brush packs,

393
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:46,252
but mostly they are with attribution and as I explained before this is a little bit of a practical issue.

394
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:55,231
This is not free, but Adobe bought the brushes from Kyle T. Webster some time ago and offers them for free if you have a subscription

395
00:20:56,512 --> 00:21:01,974
to Photoshop and I guess most of us have so I wanted to include it here that I like this better brush

396
00:21:02,935 --> 00:21:08,557
pack a lot which you also see in the background with some nice clouds and sparkle shapes and

397
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:11,779
Yeah, this is what I like and also important

398
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:17,041
I always store everything like the photos the brush specs everything into my cloud VFX library

399
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,121
With that, I have it on access on all the PCs,

400
00:21:20,161 --> 00:21:23,422
and even if my PC crashes at some point, I still have it,

401
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:25,983
and my workflow is not disturbed by losing these assets.

402
00:21:26,003 --> 00:21:28,464
So this was very important to me.

403
00:21:30,565 --> 00:21:32,745
Saving. We save our textures, don't we?

404
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:35,466
Saving is something very dear to my heart

405
00:21:35,506 --> 00:21:36,967
because I like to have it efficient,

406
00:21:37,187 --> 00:21:41,108
and this is the workflow in Photoshop,

407
00:21:41,148 --> 00:21:42,309
and this is not very efficient.

408
00:21:43,055 --> 00:21:46,377
press file and save and then select the type every time.

409
00:21:46,397 --> 00:21:48,698
And if you save as TGA, there is this little dialogue

410
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:51,780
coming up, oh, do you want to save in 24 but on 32?

411
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,181
And this is so annoying.

412
00:21:53,241 --> 00:21:55,562
And it can't be annoying because we want to

413
00:21:55,602 --> 00:21:56,903
iterate often and fast.

414
00:21:57,183 --> 00:22:00,885
And I'm getting angry looking at this GIF, and this is

415
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:01,885
already twice the speed.

416
00:22:03,086 --> 00:22:05,848
So here are my suggestions for making it better.

417
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,565
If you use Krita, there is a batch exporter coming with Krita.

418
00:22:09,785 --> 00:22:12,166
One click, you export your textures to a desired location.

419
00:22:12,526 --> 00:22:14,386
In Photoshop, there's the good old Qsave.

420
00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:16,447
Very nice script. I used it a long time,

421
00:22:16,687 --> 00:22:21,148
but nowadays I prefer the Espresso plugin from Francesco,

422
00:22:21,688 --> 00:22:27,890
which is even capable of saving some layer folders

423
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:31,091
into the different color channels of texture,

424
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:35,672
but I use it mainly for saving, and it's so good.

425
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:42,292
Okay, and the rest of this texture is actually not super exciting, but you see, I iterate quickly.

426
00:22:42,372 --> 00:22:47,574
I paint some soft brushes, then I use this plugin, which I just mentioned, to save it,

427
00:22:47,814 --> 00:22:52,717
and then switch to Unreal, look at it, and then I use this better brush pack to finish off the

428
00:22:52,757 --> 00:23:00,840
texture by just adding some nice clouds, shapes, and so on. And yeah, this is for this texture,

429
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,601
but I want to mention something.

430
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:08,498
Maybe you're thinking now, oh, Simon, you are saying that we all need big brush packs and big brush libraries.

431
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:14,523
I mean, you can, but I don't underestimate the power of the standard brushes.

432
00:23:14,623 --> 00:23:20,167
And before this talk, I talked with a lot of professionals and many of them said, oh, I just use the standard brushes most of the time.

433
00:23:20,407 --> 00:23:27,273
So I want to give out some little techniques which make you get a lot out of simple brushes.

434
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:34,915
First, if you have a boring stroke, you can make it more interesting by erasing some negative shapes with the eraser or lasso tool, for example.

435
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:37,037
So this is a very common technique.

436
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:43,882
Also, smudge is of course your friend. Simple stroke, smudge it around, another simple stroke, smudge it around.

437
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,284
And you get some nice wispy shapes out of that.

438
00:23:49,026 --> 00:23:54,110
And I want to mention down there you see tiled painting happening.

439
00:23:54,474 --> 00:24:06,384
Which means when your brush is on the one side of your canvas, it wraps around the other side of the canvas, basically, so that you can paint perfectly tiled textures there.

440
00:24:07,165 --> 00:24:11,388
And maybe you will now say, well, Krita had this forever, but what you see there is Photoshop.

441
00:24:12,676 --> 00:24:17,401
And this was just added in 2021.

442
00:24:17,801 --> 00:24:20,684
And I wanted to send it out here because I didn't know that.

443
00:24:20,764 --> 00:24:22,526
I stumbled across it on Twitter by random.

444
00:24:22,847 --> 00:24:25,409
And I just want to make sure everyone knows,

445
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:26,931
view pattern preview.

446
00:24:26,971 --> 00:24:28,272
This is Tilt Painting in Photoshop.

447
00:24:28,332 --> 00:24:29,153
It's amazing.

448
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:33,219
And Shannon has very nice tutorials

449
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:35,700
about how to use blur, motion blur,

450
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,960
to get a lot out of simple brushes.

451
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,941
And she also has very nice tutorials in general

452
00:24:42,961 --> 00:24:47,142
about standard brushes, so you can use these things.

453
00:24:47,822 --> 00:24:50,023
I will spoil it now, you don't need to take

454
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:52,403
textures of these slides, there will be something later,

455
00:24:52,543 --> 00:24:54,844
but I will talk about this later.

456
00:24:56,124 --> 00:24:58,684
But don't worry, you will not lose these resources.

457
00:25:01,396 --> 00:25:05,858
And this is the most mind-blowing to me, because I didn't use the minfilter so much.

458
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:07,539
I didn't even know that it existed.

459
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,081
And the idea of the minfilter is to increase shapes.

460
00:25:10,161 --> 00:25:13,783
As you can see, I increase the filter strength, and then the shapes get bigger and bigger.

461
00:25:14,403 --> 00:25:17,825
But I saw something very nice on the YouTube channel of C.G. Howe.

462
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:21,827
And he just painted different sizes of strokes on top of each other,

463
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,669
smudged them a little bit, a little softer brush on top.

464
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:28,891
So, pretty simple stuff, actually.

465
00:25:29,602 --> 00:25:31,542
when you use the min filter on that,

466
00:25:32,102 --> 00:25:33,822
it generates very nice shapes.

467
00:25:33,862 --> 00:25:34,442
Look at this.

468
00:25:34,703 --> 00:25:36,743
Doesn't, this is super cool.

469
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:39,543
I would, I don't know how long it would take me

470
00:25:39,603 --> 00:25:40,624
to paint this by hand.

471
00:25:41,184 --> 00:25:43,544
So this is a very cool technique to make something nice.

472
00:25:44,364 --> 00:25:45,865
And here another example from Ben,

473
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:49,025
who shows how to use the min filter with bigger values

474
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:51,246
and you get very nice, interesting stylized shapes

475
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:51,966
out of that, right?

476
00:25:51,986 --> 00:25:53,786
Just some squiggly lines

477
00:25:53,906 --> 00:25:55,787
and you get something very nice out of it.

478
00:25:57,438 --> 00:26:01,519
Okay, so that's about brushes and now let's talk about the lightweight texture.

479
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:06,660
These lightweights were generated in Photoshop and it all starts with this little shape there

480
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:12,602
and then you can apply the wave filter in Photoshop to distort it a little bit and then

481
00:26:12,622 --> 00:26:18,323
we use the good old radial blur with the zoom mode and you will see here every time you use it

482
00:26:18,403 --> 00:26:23,365
every time several times and every time I do this it gets better and better and look at these shapes

483
00:26:23,385 --> 00:26:25,325
how to develop doesn't this look awesome

484
00:26:25,706 --> 00:26:27,467
and it just takes two minutes to do it.

485
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:30,850
And just for a little comparison,

486
00:26:30,991 --> 00:26:34,134
here on the left is one of my very early textures

487
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:36,236
where I tried the same in Photoshop by hand

488
00:26:36,336 --> 00:26:37,817
and I can tell you it took me longer

489
00:26:37,837 --> 00:26:40,359
than these two minutes using the Photoshop filter.

490
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,602
And I guess we can agree that the right one

491
00:26:42,622 --> 00:26:43,923
looks a bit better.

492
00:26:46,706 --> 00:26:47,126
And we...

493
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:54,992
have a problem if you use Substance because Substance does not offer a Zoom Blur node.

494
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,419
So we as a VFX community lack this node, but...

495
00:26:59,308 --> 00:27:05,891
Unfortunately, fortunately we have Bruno in our community and he told me how to make this happen in Substance.

496
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:11,834
You can see it by using the polar to quotation note and then a directional blur and then quotation to polar again.

497
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:12,794
And this is how it looks.

498
00:27:12,954 --> 00:27:16,196
So this is our zoom blur in Substance just in case you want to have it.

499
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:22,979
And we also have fortunately Robin in our community and he used the slope blur for that.

500
00:27:23,439 --> 00:27:24,260
And it looks like this.

501
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,301
So very nice techniques in substance.

502
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:28,341
And this is my result.

503
00:27:28,702 --> 00:27:32,203
So I generated two more textures with these techniques.

504
00:27:33,664 --> 00:27:34,244
Lightning.

505
00:27:36,965 --> 00:27:39,306
If you look at the lightning, you will see this.

506
00:27:40,047 --> 00:27:42,488
What you will see when you look on different scales

507
00:27:42,548 --> 00:27:44,089
in the world on different things,

508
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:47,490
you will notice that the structures are often the same

509
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:49,211
or similar.

510
00:27:50,051 --> 00:27:51,552
You see that the river, the blood vessel,

511
00:27:51,592 --> 00:27:53,013
and this little root at the right.

512
00:27:53,518 --> 00:27:55,418
looks very similar to lightning.

513
00:27:55,478 --> 00:27:57,959
So maybe if you can't find a perfect resource

514
00:27:57,999 --> 00:27:58,979
or reference or texture,

515
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,280
maybe you can get a little bit creative with your footage.

516
00:28:02,921 --> 00:28:03,621
And so I did.

517
00:28:03,801 --> 00:28:05,541
So I used the river

518
00:28:06,482 --> 00:28:09,202
and I increased contrast and inverted it

519
00:28:09,402 --> 00:28:11,063
and then cut away everything

520
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:12,703
what did not look like a lightning.

521
00:28:13,964 --> 00:28:16,424
And then I also copied some parts

522
00:28:16,484 --> 00:28:17,625
from other parts of the river

523
00:28:17,705 --> 00:28:19,725
and rearranged them to look like my lightning.

524
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,826
And this is how I did my lightning.

525
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:28,468
But I wanted to have it fade out, no, fade in from top to bottom and fade out in a global

526
00:28:28,788 --> 00:28:35,430
erosion-y way, okay. But this was easy just in Photoshop. On top I made a little gradient. I

527
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:40,550
hope you can see there's a little gradient from top to bottom. And for the fade out mask, I just

528
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:45,611
used the Photoshop inner glow filter. And yeah, maybe it's not perfect, but it's good enough.

529
00:28:48,032 --> 00:28:52,773
And the water splash is maybe now that we saw how to use these photos, not super special.

530
00:28:53,272 --> 00:29:01,235
But I just take this photo, increase the contrast, and then I cut out all the pieces I like and assemble them to a nice little water splash.

531
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:10,178
And what I want to emphasize here is reusability of textures, of VFX textures,

532
00:29:10,238 --> 00:29:11,779
because you should, if possible,

533
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:17,176
Reuse them as much as you can and here's an example on my little explosion on the left

534
00:29:17,516 --> 00:29:23,179
You see these sandy spikes like the scent going off right and this is exactly the same texture like my water splash

535
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,543
So why should I create another water another scent splash texture if this is good enough, right?

536
00:29:30,144 --> 00:29:32,325
So lucky for me it saved some time

537
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:33,686
Yeah

538
00:29:34,745 --> 00:29:45,057
And also the moon in the background uses the blue channel of one of the textures from Lewis texture pack as a base for my little LUT so that I could colorize it again.

539
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:49,361
So I just reused whatever I could get in my hands.

540
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:51,203
And the water.

541
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:53,727
is something I saw on a YouTube video.

542
00:29:53,767 --> 00:29:55,887
This is why, oh, on the next slide,

543
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,228
it will say source unknown,

544
00:29:57,308 --> 00:29:58,928
because I saw it in a very nice video,

545
00:29:58,948 --> 00:30:01,149
but I forgot what the video was.

546
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:02,769
So if you see this talk,

547
00:30:02,829 --> 00:30:05,209
please people tell me that it was you

548
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:07,370
and I will add you as a source.

549
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,730
I generated these difference clouds in Substance,

550
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,431
but you can also do it in Photoshop

551
00:30:11,451 --> 00:30:15,912
by applying the difference clouds filter twice

552
00:30:16,112 --> 00:30:16,752
on your canvas.

553
00:30:17,392 --> 00:30:20,073
And then I use Substance to generate the normal map.

554
00:30:20,113 --> 00:30:20,233
So.

555
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:26,998
not too special, but what I like about Substance is the preview, because it's very nice to emphasize

556
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:32,543
how roughly it will look in your game, right? And I would also like to underline that these

557
00:30:32,623 --> 00:30:39,429
shapes on the left there, they look awfully a lot like lightning. And it is actually a technique to

558
00:30:39,529 --> 00:30:44,714
generate these clouds, increase the contrast, and then use these shapes for your lightning textures.

559
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:48,537
But I did not, because I wanted to show you the creative approach using photos.

560
00:30:50,877 --> 00:30:52,599
And the sources are unknown, like I said.

561
00:30:54,281 --> 00:30:56,102
And now let's talk about the waterfall.

562
00:30:56,282 --> 00:30:58,565
So the waterfall starts, of course, with a reference.

563
00:30:58,585 --> 00:30:59,766
I really liked.

564
00:31:00,506 --> 00:31:05,011
And there's something, we will use substance for that.

565
00:31:05,471 --> 00:31:07,533
And when I think about substance,

566
00:31:07,593 --> 00:31:10,576
I always think about making things from scratch.

567
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:15,874
I guess it comes from the fact that the substance tutorials out there for stone and sand and all these cool things

568
00:31:16,154 --> 00:31:20,897
always start from scratch and they generate photo-realistic results and this is just amazing.

569
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:28,875
But I tried and to be honest, I think this explosion texture, which I tried doing from scratch, could be improved a little bit.

570
00:31:28,915 --> 00:31:35,262
And also this fire is not without potential to get better.

571
00:31:35,802 --> 00:31:39,466
But at some point I realized, why should I do everything from scratch?

572
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:44,031
Why not take a flame from a photo like here, use a tile sampler node?

573
00:31:45,347 --> 00:31:48,668
and just splattered on the canvas and substance

574
00:31:48,728 --> 00:31:52,430
and then get a perfectly nice, fiery, tileable texture

575
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,231
out of this within some minutes.

576
00:31:55,772 --> 00:31:57,753
And this is what I did for the waterfall.

577
00:31:57,793 --> 00:31:59,414
So I took this amazing texture from...

578
00:32:01,057 --> 00:32:03,618
from textures.com and

579
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:09,901
Made the border a little bit softer and then used this tile sampler node to just splatter the world and this is the result

580
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,702
you can see here is get it up and down to see how

581
00:32:13,543 --> 00:32:17,225
where the actual textures are and I think it blends very very well and

582
00:32:17,325 --> 00:32:23,028
Then I put it on my waterfall on the edge and now I'm contradicting myself a little bit

583
00:32:23,428 --> 00:32:28,030
I said we are talking about good enough, but I was not super satisfied even though it should be good enough, right?

584
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:28,670
but

585
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,444
I wanted to try something else because I found it did not resemble too much the structures

586
00:32:34,544 --> 00:32:36,486
in my reference folder, right?

587
00:32:37,327 --> 00:32:38,708
Folder, texture, picture.

588
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,292
So then I did something crazy.

589
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,795
I used the reference picture as texture.

590
00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:50,099
So I got into Substance with the SVG node,

591
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,180
which lets you paint

592
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:55,423
vertex, no, vertex, vector shapes, yeah.

593
00:32:55,883 --> 00:32:57,024
So I painted some vector shapes,

594
00:32:57,124 --> 00:32:58,084
I blurred them a little bit,

595
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:00,726
and with that I cut away all these pieces

596
00:33:00,766 --> 00:33:01,746
which I did not need.

597
00:33:02,807 --> 00:33:04,848
And then I did the same like before.

598
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:06,990
I just spread it around a lot

599
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,012
and have now a texture which looks like this,

600
00:33:10,432 --> 00:33:12,873
which resembles more the structure I was looking for.

601
00:33:13,762 --> 00:33:15,604
But then while looking at all these photos,

602
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:19,607
I saw this and I really liked these layer structure

603
00:33:19,627 --> 00:33:20,747
in this waterfall, right?

604
00:33:21,088 --> 00:33:25,331
But I couldn't find a nice texture to resemble it.

605
00:33:26,051 --> 00:33:28,293
But what I found was when you look at the forest

606
00:33:29,294 --> 00:33:30,455
and you flip the forest

607
00:33:30,995 --> 00:33:33,197
and you increase the contrast a little bit,

608
00:33:33,497 --> 00:33:37,020
it looks kind of like these layer structures, right?

609
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,362
So I just took this in my substance

610
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:44,561
and overlaid this layer with the other layer I created before.

611
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:48,043
And now I got here where I have some nice structures,

612
00:33:48,103 --> 00:33:52,906
but also sometimes you see these wavy layer things falling down, right?

613
00:33:53,746 --> 00:33:56,448
So, yeah, this is what I ended up with.

614
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,320
And here are some more creative ways.

615
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,643
This one is from Pete Clark, how to use interesting photo choices for your,

616
00:34:04,043 --> 00:34:04,703
for your textures.

617
00:34:04,723 --> 00:34:07,184
So he generates a mass of flesh out of a little rubber duck.

618
00:34:07,885 --> 00:34:13,928
And here is the good old chicken thingy, which gets converted into a texture.

619
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:14,468
Yeah.

620
00:34:15,188 --> 00:34:18,510
So unfortunately these are not for me, but they are still awesome.

621
00:34:20,664 --> 00:34:22,625
Okay, and now let's talk about this little cloud.

622
00:34:22,985 --> 00:34:26,408
For this little cloud, I used a tool,

623
00:34:26,548 --> 00:34:28,709
which is just there for creating clouds.

624
00:34:28,729 --> 00:34:30,510
It's called KumoWorks, it's open source.

625
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,832
And you can paint a very simple shape

626
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:35,913
and it will create a very nice cloud.

627
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:37,194
There are a lot of sliders,

628
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,495
but you can use these templates

629
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:42,457
to get different cloud structures out of that,

630
00:34:42,517 --> 00:34:43,678
which is super, super nice.

631
00:34:44,202 --> 00:34:46,804
And also, you can change the light source direction,

632
00:34:46,844 --> 00:34:49,006
which means that if your shader can do it,

633
00:34:50,107 --> 00:34:52,289
you can generate different lightmaps from all direction

634
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:55,392
and then you have a six-sided lightmap shader in your game

635
00:34:55,532 --> 00:34:56,893
if you want to have this.

636
00:34:57,914 --> 00:35:00,276
And here is the texture I generated out of this.

637
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:03,178
And for this cloud, I generated three different masks,

638
00:35:03,298 --> 00:35:04,460
the diffuse mask, of course.

639
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,022
But then I wanted, when the lightning goes off,

640
00:35:07,422 --> 00:35:08,603
have a little mask from below

641
00:35:08,743 --> 00:35:11,606
that the little cloud is a little bit too lit.

642
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:15,942
And for that I just used the light source,

643
00:35:16,022 --> 00:35:17,143
comes from below now.

644
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,585
Just used another version of my little cloud

645
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:20,906
and increased the contrast.

646
00:35:21,346 --> 00:35:23,688
And then took my original texture, inverted it,

647
00:35:23,808 --> 00:35:26,130
and then increased the contrast a bit

648
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,391
and masked it a bit out.

649
00:35:28,471 --> 00:35:29,352
And combined both.

650
00:35:29,772 --> 00:35:32,755
And this is my little mask for the lighting.

651
00:35:33,695 --> 00:35:36,097
No, the lightning for the lighting cloud.

652
00:35:39,379 --> 00:35:41,900
Was this correct? I don't know. Okay, but you get what I'm saying.

653
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:47,744
And the last thing is I wanted to have this cloud appear, not just fade in and out.

654
00:35:48,084 --> 00:35:53,448
I wanted to appear at least at the beginning and that it grows, you know, that it erodes into the scene.

655
00:35:53,888 --> 00:35:58,811
And this is, I just painted with soft standard brushes on top of the alpha channel.

656
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:02,234
And that's basically just what I did there.

657
00:36:02,834 --> 00:36:07,737
And these three different masks I put now into one texture.

658
00:36:08,158 --> 00:36:09,239
into the RGB channels.

659
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:11,180
And this is something we know as gray packing

660
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,301
or channel packing.

661
00:36:12,361 --> 00:36:14,462
It's very common, known technique,

662
00:36:14,902 --> 00:36:16,803
but I wanted to add two things about that.

663
00:36:18,283 --> 00:36:24,187
First, I don't know if you know, but in Photoshop, in the layer style, in your layer folders or the layers themselves,

664
00:36:24,207 --> 00:36:30,612
you can enable these checkboxes to send this photo or layer directly to the color channel, which is amazing and super easy.

665
00:36:31,432 --> 00:36:36,956
So you can do that here in my GIF. You see how I just check these boxes and everything is set up.

666
00:36:37,477 --> 00:36:41,359
Or you just use the plugin by Francesco. It is also capable of doing that.

667
00:36:41,379 --> 00:36:44,702
But I wanted to share this knowledge here.

668
00:36:45,482 --> 00:36:46,163
And second.

669
00:36:47,282 --> 00:36:49,683
The big advantage of channel packing

670
00:36:50,303 --> 00:36:52,744
is that you have to sample your texture only once

671
00:36:53,105 --> 00:36:53,665
in the shader.

672
00:36:53,725 --> 00:36:55,246
Yeah, here I sample it only once,

673
00:36:55,786 --> 00:36:57,467
and then I can use these three masks

674
00:36:57,507 --> 00:37:00,529
which are put into the RGB channels for whatever I want.

675
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:07,852
But often my shaders sample each layer separately anyway

676
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,274
because, for example, I want to move them in different ways

677
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:12,935
or maybe I want to sample them in different resolutions

678
00:37:13,015 --> 00:37:14,776
or something with different UV tilings.

679
00:37:15,677 --> 00:37:16,717
And so for my...

680
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:23,480
workflow 90% of the time I noticed that this channel packing I love this technique, but I

681
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,322
prefer to store these masks as grayscale images just as separate ones and then I can reuse them

682
00:37:29,462 --> 00:37:36,084
very easily in other shaders which also read in these masks. But it is a very cool technique for

683
00:37:36,104 --> 00:37:41,726
these special cases like my little cloud and there is actually a talk from Nikola about spell bounds

684
00:37:41,806 --> 00:37:43,987
which I heavily recommend. It's super cool. They use

685
00:37:44,669 --> 00:37:47,411
this technique for almost all the VFX textures,

686
00:37:47,711 --> 00:37:49,812
and they have one master shader reading in everything,

687
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:50,952
and it's super interesting.

688
00:37:50,972 --> 00:37:53,694
So if you like the technique, then, yeah,

689
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:55,695
you can have a look on this talk.

690
00:37:57,936 --> 00:37:58,496
Shader magic.

691
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,617
It doesn't fit in here so well

692
00:38:00,637 --> 00:38:02,838
because I would like to talk about textures, right?

693
00:38:03,318 --> 00:38:05,900
But I think there are three simple techniques

694
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,381
which can boost your textures a lot.

695
00:38:08,461 --> 00:38:10,002
And it was important to me to share them

696
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:11,783
because even if you are a bit hesitant

697
00:38:11,803 --> 00:38:14,384
with going into material or shader creation.

698
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,492
I think these can help you a lot.

699
00:38:17,112 --> 00:38:19,052
And so I wanted to share this.

700
00:38:19,813 --> 00:38:23,034
UV distortion, lookup textures, and erosion

701
00:38:23,254 --> 00:38:25,755
are three techniques which are simple but cool.

702
00:38:27,295 --> 00:38:29,836
And UV distortion, we saw that at the beginning already,

703
00:38:29,956 --> 00:38:32,437
it adds some motion, like my little cloud starts bubbling

704
00:38:32,757 --> 00:38:35,178
if you generate it with this example here.

705
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:37,759
And here is the cloud again.

706
00:38:37,879 --> 00:38:40,180
You see that, yeah, my static texture,

707
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,100
not super exciting, but up there

708
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,561
with this simple shader trick.

709
00:38:43,998 --> 00:38:46,239
a lot of motion suddenly, which I really like.

710
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,601
And lookup textures are like we spoken before,

711
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:54,522
just there to colorize your grayscale image or mask

712
00:38:54,562 --> 00:38:56,923
with a little lookup gradient.

713
00:38:57,803 --> 00:38:59,344
Very resourceful technique.

714
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:03,065
And it also changes how you create your textures.

715
00:39:03,705 --> 00:39:05,026
Because instead, if you have,

716
00:39:05,546 --> 00:39:10,848
or if you want to have different versions for your flipbook,

717
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:16,133
you do not need to store them separately into different color versions.

718
00:39:16,493 --> 00:39:22,078
You can now use a grayscale flipbook and colorize it with these little lookup gradients, which is

719
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:27,763
better for performance and memory and also gives you as a VFX artist more flexibility.

720
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:32,779
It is also used, and this is for the stylized people,

721
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:34,960
you can use it for stylization as well.

722
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,101
So on the left is the explosion like seen before,

723
00:39:38,121 --> 00:39:40,861
and on the right, I used the little lookup texture

724
00:39:40,901 --> 00:39:42,922
which only has some colors,

725
00:39:43,102 --> 00:39:45,863
and you can see that it looks very more comic-y,

726
00:39:46,163 --> 00:39:46,543
I would say.

727
00:39:48,023 --> 00:39:50,924
So it's a very useful tool to have into your belt.

728
00:39:53,025 --> 00:39:55,205
And erosion is like bespoken before.

729
00:39:55,705 --> 00:39:57,846
They are for making the fade out a bit more interesting.

730
00:39:58,878 --> 00:40:01,599
And here you can see another little shared example.

731
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:05,001
I just put them in for someone who wants to implement it later.

732
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:09,423
And it basically fakes complexity

733
00:40:09,903 --> 00:40:11,524
so that here you see on the left side,

734
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:14,246
there's the little texture, and you see these shapes falling down.

735
00:40:14,306 --> 00:40:16,347
And while they're falling down, they dissolve, right?

736
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,848
And on the right, you see how it would look like

737
00:40:18,988 --> 00:40:21,429
if you would just use soft alpha, and it's not just exciting.

738
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:23,730
And...

739
00:40:24,415 --> 00:40:35,084
Here the same example on the left we see these water splashes and while they are falling down they erode away so it looks way more exciting I think than on the right side where nothing happens basically.

740
00:40:36,405 --> 00:40:38,626
Yeah.

741
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:41,168
Yeah, and here's the Alpha Rosin, the soft Alpha.

742
00:40:41,877 --> 00:40:44,818
And this is also a technique which can be used for stylization.

743
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:49,882
Again, left side is the explosion, this time with the stylized look up texture assigned.

744
00:40:50,262 --> 00:40:53,644
And on the right side, you see how the alpha erodes away.

745
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:57,266
And I think it looks way more like a stylized, I don't know, manga animation

746
00:40:58,307 --> 00:41:00,868
or explosion than the left side, right?

747
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:08,893
So, there are not too many resources to

748
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,922
about this topic about the texture generation itself, but there are

749
00:41:14,922 --> 00:41:19,285
quite some tools out there like for example, the cloud tool I just showed and

750
00:41:20,065 --> 00:41:21,606
did you know for example that

751
00:41:22,327 --> 00:41:26,789
Krita has a particle brush engine which allows you to paint very nice wispy smoke

752
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:33,653
or that Photoshop has a flame filter which generates very nice flamey shapes for you and

753
00:41:33,853 --> 00:41:35,294
we did not even talk about

754
00:41:36,497 --> 00:41:43,062
The effect texture maker, which is a tool running in your browser and it can generate many kinds of different textures for you

755
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:48,706
And save it into a flipbook super practical

756
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:52,669
And then there is a flame painter is a very commonly known tool

757
00:41:53,049 --> 00:41:58,373
But it is I I didn't know that there is an online version, which you can also use for creating very interesting

758
00:41:59,234 --> 00:42:01,395
Things and you can see the links down there, of course

759
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:10,975
And I think it would be nice if we could collect all this knowledge at some point, maybe a decentralized.

760
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:19,037
website or something so that everyone can access that because it's really, it took a lot of research for me to find all these things.

761
00:42:19,798 --> 00:42:24,881
And I think it would be nice if this person can then maybe would prepare a talk about this and while

762
00:42:25,281 --> 00:42:27,382
talking then mentioned that he actually did.

763
00:42:27,982 --> 00:42:32,945
So I created this resource database for my preparation where I collected all these things

764
00:42:33,525 --> 00:42:37,828
and I separated in eight different categories.

765
00:42:37,868 --> 00:42:39,809
The first four are like to find.

766
00:42:40,327 --> 00:42:43,468
textures and texture patches and packs and brushes,

767
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:46,250
and also some photo and video footage,

768
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,331
which you can use as a base for your textures.

769
00:42:50,792 --> 00:42:53,073
And the other four are focused on tutorials.

770
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:55,755
So I collected any tutorial I could find.

771
00:42:55,775 --> 00:42:56,855
I mean, there are not too many,

772
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:59,837
but what I could find I put in there

773
00:43:00,417 --> 00:43:02,818
for the different methods of generating the textures.

774
00:43:03,759 --> 00:43:06,360
And if you feel fancy, you're of course free

775
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,822
to search the database directly by yourself with keywords.

776
00:43:10,759 --> 00:43:14,880
by authors or maybe some like fire or lightning or something like that.

777
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:19,182
I need to mention I will extend the keywords further in the future.

778
00:43:20,402 --> 00:43:22,303
So if there's maybe something in there

779
00:43:23,523 --> 00:43:26,284
which you can't find yet, hopefully in the future it will be better.

780
00:43:26,344 --> 00:43:31,185
I didn't have too much time to perfectionize all the tagging yet,

781
00:43:31,285 --> 00:43:32,326
but I will do in the future.

782
00:43:34,586 --> 00:43:39,128
And now you may ask, yeah, that's great, but how do I access that?

783
00:43:40,221 --> 00:43:44,862
And to that I would answer, you can use this QR code,

784
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:49,824
or this URL, or this very small URL down there,

785
00:43:49,844 --> 00:43:52,385
if you like it a little bit shorter.

786
00:43:53,405 --> 00:43:55,386
And this will lead you to a website,

787
00:43:56,306 --> 00:43:58,847
just some notes on the website, just some links.

788
00:43:59,447 --> 00:44:01,568
And it will not only contain the link

789
00:44:01,648 --> 00:44:02,888
to the resource database,

790
00:44:03,669 --> 00:44:07,030
it also contains links to these slides.

791
00:44:07,759 --> 00:44:10,521
So if you want to revisit something or you saw a source,

792
00:44:10,561 --> 00:44:13,544
that's why I mentioned before you don't need to take photos

793
00:44:13,564 --> 00:44:15,265
because you have it already right now.

794
00:44:15,685 --> 00:44:18,468
It is online right now and you can just look at the slides.

795
00:44:18,508 --> 00:44:22,391
And I also added what I basically saying right now

796
00:44:22,551 --> 00:44:24,192
should be readable in these slides

797
00:44:24,673 --> 00:44:26,374
as a little speaker's commentary.

798
00:44:26,394 --> 00:44:28,395
So I hope this helps people

799
00:44:28,436 --> 00:44:30,577
who maybe didn't visit the talk yet.

800
00:44:31,658 --> 00:44:36,399
And it will also contain the Unreal project files and the substance files.

801
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:41,040
And later, if this talk goes online, the video recording.

802
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:47,041
And there is some stuff which did not make it into this talk because of time purposes.

803
00:44:47,361 --> 00:44:51,922
So when you scroll down, there's a little secret section called Content++.

804
00:44:52,262 --> 00:44:55,343
And you can look at these slides for even more little tricks.

805
00:44:55,743 --> 00:45:00,884
And I added a commentary in the speaker's notes just for these reasons.

806
00:45:03,872 --> 00:45:07,553
And you can help to make this whole situation better if you want,

807
00:45:07,993 --> 00:45:11,595
because I think there are, like I said, not too many resources. Right.

808
00:45:12,055 --> 00:45:15,157
So if you because.

809
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:20,099
In my perfect dream world, this talk is just the beginning.

810
00:45:21,299 --> 00:45:24,041
Of this whole discussion, and maybe it can inspire other people

811
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:28,343
to generate some more resources now specifically for this topic, I would.

812
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:34,953
Very much like it to feel less overwhelmed in the future and if you do you can use this hashtag because it was only used

813
00:45:35,093 --> 00:45:37,013
once on twitter by cghow actually

814
00:45:37,914 --> 00:45:40,395
And I think we can just take it and share our

815
00:45:41,235 --> 00:45:41,895
knowledge there

816
00:45:43,216 --> 00:45:49,278
If you have more resources which are not already in the database then feel free to tell me and I can add the resource

817
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:50,699
um

818
00:45:51,279 --> 00:45:55,220
And if you share something already, like maybe you're sharing a texture pack or something

819
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:59,453
then please share it as CC0 so that anyone can use it

820
00:45:59,493 --> 00:46:01,674
without attribution or charge money.

821
00:46:02,914 --> 00:46:03,615
This is totally fine.

822
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:05,575
I'm happy to pay for good content,

823
00:46:05,915 --> 00:46:09,397
but it would be nice to avoid attribution issue.

824
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:14,098
And if you can paint, maybe you consider

825
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:16,079
making a little tutorial about this,

826
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:18,840
because sometimes I see concept artists, amazing pieces.

827
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:24,484
Like I don't know a castle or dragon or something and then they paint over some effects

828
00:46:24,584 --> 00:46:28,368
And I'm like oh, I would like to know how you did paint these effects, right?

829
00:46:29,549 --> 00:46:35,034
So there's a little example Kiernan had usually he paints figures and stuff like that

830
00:46:35,094 --> 00:46:40,799
But he has one video about video game particles, and I really enjoyed that much. It was a really cool little

831
00:46:41,399 --> 00:46:45,103
Lecture and yeah, maybe other people fancy that too

832
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:53,265
And if you are a VFX artist, maybe you consider to not only share your VFX in your ArtStation profile,

833
00:46:54,406 --> 00:46:58,049
but maybe also the textures, because even though you don't see the process,

834
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:02,634
it's still a very good learning opportunity to see what an effect was made of.

835
00:47:05,616 --> 00:47:09,700
And if you want, maybe you want to even show your process, maybe even this bead painting.

836
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,603
A very nice example is Sarah Kamadi.

837
00:47:13,022 --> 00:47:17,509
and she shares a lot of processes. This is just simple GIFs. She also has speed paintings on her

838
00:47:17,569 --> 00:47:23,679
ArtStation page and it's not necessarily a VFX texture now, but I think it's still a good example

839
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:27,665
how much you can take out of even this simple GIF. It's so cool to see, right?

840
00:47:28,872 --> 00:47:32,974
Yeah, so these are the things you can do if you want to improve the whole situation.

841
00:47:33,734 --> 00:47:38,536
And my chief studio, this is the company I'm working at, is also hiring.

842
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:43,018
So if you feel like you would like to work in the South of France in a very nice team

843
00:47:43,058 --> 00:47:50,141
and like you can see a very nice little office, then feel free to check out this little URL.

844
00:47:51,261 --> 00:47:56,143
And I would also like to take the time to thank some people because Celine.

845
00:47:56,725 --> 00:47:58,126
is our CEO at YG.

846
00:47:58,386 --> 00:48:02,248
And without her, it wouldn't have been possible for me to fly here and to stay here.

847
00:48:02,888 --> 00:48:04,349
So thank you so much for that.

848
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:08,471
And Lea organized the whole trip and she took away a lot of stress for me,

849
00:48:08,551 --> 00:48:09,231
I can tell you.

850
00:48:09,711 --> 00:48:13,633
And of course, Lea was also my contact person to GDC

851
00:48:13,653 --> 00:48:17,635
and without him, I wouldn't even have dared to apply for this.

852
00:48:18,723 --> 00:48:20,785
for this talk here, so thank you so much.

853
00:48:20,825 --> 00:48:23,547
And the other people there, I highly recommend

854
00:48:23,668 --> 00:48:26,470
checking their profiles out, they are all great artists

855
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,633
and these are the people who gave me so much feedback

856
00:48:29,793 --> 00:48:31,875
for this talk and shaped it together with me.

857
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:35,518
So if you liked it, feel free to visit their profiles

858
00:48:35,578 --> 00:48:36,439
and give them some love.

859
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,142
If you did not like it, then that's on me.

860
00:48:40,783 --> 00:48:42,785
And if there are more questions,

861
00:48:43,526 --> 00:48:44,527
then of course you can...

862
00:48:45,258 --> 00:48:46,558
send me a Twitter or an email.

863
00:48:46,998 --> 00:48:48,539
Of course, we can also talk after this

864
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:51,700
because I love to speak to fellow VFX guys.

865
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:55,681
And so that's this for that.

866
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,702
Yeah, I didn't forget anything.

867
00:48:58,102 --> 00:48:59,022
Yeah, and this is the end.

868
00:48:59,242 --> 00:49:02,723
So my name is Simon and please don't forget

869
00:49:03,703 --> 00:49:05,224
using photos is not cheating.

870
00:49:05,604 --> 00:49:05,884
Thank you.

871
00:49:16,305 --> 00:49:18,685
And please fill out the vote forms, I shall say.

872
00:49:18,725 --> 00:49:21,966
These little things to, you know, you know it, right?

873
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:23,826
The vote, the feedback forms, okay?

874
00:49:24,506 --> 00:49:24,726
Great.

875
00:49:26,346 --> 00:49:26,867
So that's for me.

876
00:49:27,027 --> 00:49:31,107
Yeah, we have 10 minutes left, which is very pleasant.

877
00:49:32,327 --> 00:49:34,528
In my tests, sometimes I run a bit over the time,

878
00:49:34,568 --> 00:49:37,668
but I guess I was a bit nervous and spoke faster.

879
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:42,249
So if you want, you can ask something.

880
00:49:42,329 --> 00:49:44,450
But like I said, we can also talk afterwards,

881
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:45,210
if you want.

882
00:49:48,587 --> 00:49:49,147
Oh, a question.

883
00:49:49,807 --> 00:49:50,567
Oh no, two questions.

884
00:49:52,348 --> 00:49:53,728
Oh, that's great.

885
00:49:54,129 --> 00:49:57,590
You have a fantastic hierarchy for organizing

886
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:58,830
which route you take.

887
00:49:59,571 --> 00:50:02,932
Have you ever had to sell that workflow to a company

888
00:50:02,972 --> 00:50:07,393
that had more set in stone pipelines of their own?

889
00:50:09,615 --> 00:50:21,074
No, good question. Like this pipeline, if it would be implemented in a company and you mean that maybe I hit against the wall maybe by implementing it?

890
00:50:21,414 --> 00:50:22,957
Against what they were used to.

891
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:28,772
Yeah, my problem is that I was always the only sole VFX artist in this company.

892
00:50:28,953 --> 00:50:31,314
So and I never worked in a huge company.

893
00:50:32,014 --> 00:50:33,976
So positively formulated.

894
00:50:33,996 --> 00:50:34,936
I never hit the wall.

895
00:50:35,136 --> 00:50:35,997
So that's good.

896
00:50:37,478 --> 00:50:42,081
But it also means that I never have a real fixed guideline to follow.

897
00:50:42,241 --> 00:50:47,164
I just was doing it on the go and hoped it will result in something positive.

898
00:50:48,585 --> 00:50:49,245
Thank you so much.

899
00:50:50,526 --> 00:50:50,646
Hey.

900
00:50:52,824 --> 00:50:55,348
Before the question, by the way, if everyone doesn't know,

901
00:50:55,368 --> 00:50:58,232
there's a VFX meetup at the St. Regis Lobby Bar

902
00:50:58,292 --> 00:50:59,494
Thursday night at 630.

903
00:50:59,615 --> 00:51:00,917
So come hang out.

904
00:51:00,937 --> 00:51:00,977
OK.

905
00:51:03,751 --> 00:51:08,574
Optical flow, motion vectors and slate, I've done a lot of that, it's an awesome tool,

906
00:51:08,954 --> 00:51:13,276
but the numbers never seem to translate into Unreal correctly, I don't know the motion

907
00:51:13,316 --> 00:51:17,079
vector intensity number that it gives you seems to be just completely wrong.

908
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:22,602
And I usually just half and I just kind of eyeball it, have you found a better way than

909
00:51:22,642 --> 00:51:23,122
that to...

910
00:51:24,909 --> 00:51:26,369
to take that and get it looking correct.

911
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:29,011
This is a question coming from one who knows the pain.

912
00:51:31,472 --> 00:51:33,393
I did actually two tutorials about this

913
00:51:33,533 --> 00:51:35,233
and I basically eyeball it as well

914
00:51:35,493 --> 00:51:36,894
because they give you some numbers

915
00:51:37,054 --> 00:51:38,655
which are supposed to be correct,

916
00:51:39,435 --> 00:51:41,236
but they are not really, right?

917
00:51:41,836 --> 00:51:43,597
And I have this YouTube channel,

918
00:51:43,617 --> 00:51:44,657
it's called Unreal Simon,

919
00:51:44,938 --> 00:51:46,818
and there I made two videos just about Slate

920
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:48,239
and how to get these things out of that.

921
00:51:50,215 --> 00:51:54,619
There are some other numbers which supposedly have nothing to do with that, but for me they worked.

922
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:56,140
So I just took them.

923
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:02,124
And then of course, if I was not satisfied, I also eyeballed it.

924
00:52:02,184 --> 00:52:07,888
But the usability could be improved a little bit in that regard.

925
00:52:08,929 --> 00:52:11,831
And that's not the motion of extra intensity, that's some other numbers that are...

926
00:52:11,931 --> 00:52:15,754
Is that in the tutorial that you mentioned? Where to find those numbers?

927
00:52:17,476 --> 00:52:20,957
Yeah, I think the numbers change.

928
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,559
The numbers change depending on what you,

929
00:52:24,659 --> 00:52:25,860
how your simulation looks like.

930
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:26,720
I think it is like that.

931
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:30,602
And I mean, is the YouTube here?

932
00:52:30,622 --> 00:52:32,443
Maybe can you look at this together?

933
00:52:32,463 --> 00:52:34,644
YouTube, let me see.

934
00:52:34,824 --> 00:52:37,766
YouTube, Unreal, Simon.

935
00:52:43,487 --> 00:52:45,648
Problem is there's also a Simon Unreal Hotel.

936
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:46,949
Oh no, this was with Houdini.

937
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:49,792
Why do I don't find my video?

938
00:52:50,152 --> 00:52:51,874
Because then we can have a look at it together.

939
00:52:51,914 --> 00:52:53,835
But in general, it's a tutorial in general

940
00:52:53,935 --> 00:52:58,419
about the whole Slate workflow,

941
00:52:58,439 --> 00:53:01,462
but it covers the, sorry, I can't find it right now.

942
00:53:01,502 --> 00:53:06,065
I don't know why the Google search doesn't show it to me.

943
00:53:06,406 --> 00:53:09,108
But this part is a small part of it.

944
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:11,870
So I think you will hopefully be happy when you see it.

945
00:53:12,191 --> 00:53:12,491
Thank you.

946
00:53:13,389 --> 00:53:14,250
Thank you so much.

947
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:18,954
Okay, if there is no more questions,

948
00:53:18,974 --> 00:53:23,217
then I can just show you just for a short moment

949
00:53:23,278 --> 00:53:25,760
the content++ section, which looks like this,

950
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:29,082
content++, and then here there's some more things.

951
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:31,124
For example, a summary of all the knowledge nuggets

952
00:53:31,164 --> 00:53:33,666
I wanted to drop on you, just a little summary,

953
00:53:33,706 --> 00:53:37,550
and then there are some more little examples down there,

954
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,151
and like you see, there's comments down there.

955
00:53:39,191 --> 00:53:41,013
So this hopefully makes you happy.

956
00:53:42,764 --> 00:53:45,686
And by the way, just because I forgot to talk,

957
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:49,950
this texture is so wide because it was put

958
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:52,572
on this long rim of water.

959
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,914
So I wanted to avoid tiling issues.

960
00:53:55,074 --> 00:53:59,318
You know, if I would have used a square texture,

961
00:54:00,298 --> 00:54:01,720
you would have seen the tiling too much.

962
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,182
That's why it was so wide.

963
00:54:04,202 --> 00:54:08,545
Okay, so yeah, if there's no more questions,

964
00:54:08,585 --> 00:54:09,006
then we can...

965
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:12,043
I don't know I have water now.

966
00:54:13,425 --> 00:54:14,847
So thank you for being here.

967
00:54:15,327 --> 00:54:16,809
It was really nice to,

968
00:54:17,891 --> 00:54:19,353
gift me your time and listen to me.

969
00:54:19,573 --> 00:54:20,134
Thank you so much.
