1
00:00:03,618 --> 00:00:13,482
Welcome, welcome. I'm Aaron Thibault. If you're in the right place, I want to make sure. I'm VP of product development and an executive producer at Gearbox Software.

2
00:00:13,482 --> 00:00:22,985
I oversee the Borderlands franchise. I also oversee all development. Essentially GM of the studio, everyone that's making games reports up to me.

3
00:00:22,985 --> 00:00:28,287
My boss is Randy Pitchford, CEO of the studio and founder.

4
00:00:28,287 --> 00:00:32,608
My second boss is Stephen Ball, CFO, another founder.

5
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:38,599
the two owners of the studio who are still in and making games

6
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:42,847
at Gearbox. And my third boss is the studio.

7
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:48,833
I make sure that I fulfill whatever they need first and foremost.

8
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:55,498
I also teach, I'm a professor at Baylor University, where I teach capstone and engineering.

9
00:00:55,498 --> 00:00:59,401
I like working with, kind of, in that context, really small teams of students.

10
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:05,846
I have seven this semester, which is different from the close to 300 I have internally at Gearbox,

11
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:07,267
plus, you know, all the external.

12
00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:11,469
people that we have close relationships with at Gearbox.

13
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:13,910
So it's kind of refreshing to do that.

14
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,951
And today I'm doing a little bit different format

15
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:20,852
from what I've done in past years, if you've ever heard me talk before.

16
00:01:20,852 --> 00:01:23,993
Usually I rely heavily on memes and pictures

17
00:01:23,993 --> 00:01:25,654
and go more for entertainment value

18
00:01:25,654 --> 00:01:27,734
and giving you food you didn't ask for.

19
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:32,236
This year what I want to do more is actually cut through the bullshit a bit

20
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:35,697
and get more into what...

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,264
we're looking for anyway and what people I talk to you in

22
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:43,166
production around the industry are looking for in their

23
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,287
producers.

24
00:01:44,287 --> 00:01:48,850
And how to move crawl, walk, run style from getting your

25
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,754
foot in, which many of you probably already have.

26
00:01:52,754 --> 00:01:56,437
Quick survey, who in here already is a producer in some

27
00:01:56,437 --> 00:01:58,718
kind of production capacity of Studio?

28
00:01:58,718 --> 00:01:59,519
Awesome.

29
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,802
And who here is looking to go that route or making a lateral

30
00:02:03,802 --> 00:02:05,524
move or something like that?

31
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:05,624
Cool.

32
00:02:06,604 --> 00:02:08,885
Students? Students? A few? Wow.

33
00:02:08,885 --> 00:02:11,908
I'm, I'm, first of all, I'm flattered that so many of you

34
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:14,650
who are already producers in the industry

35
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,213
decided to come to this talk when there are so many

36
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:20,075
other cool sounding talks out there.

37
00:02:20,075 --> 00:02:22,897
And congrats to those of you who are,

38
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:24,639
students who are looking to get into the industry,

39
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,802
seeking out, you know, opportunities like this

40
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:30,464
to, to hear a little bit from people

41
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:31,365
who have been doing it a while.

42
00:02:32,315 --> 00:02:35,716
I've been in games now going on 20 years.

43
00:02:35,716 --> 00:02:37,457
I was in music before that.

44
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,398
I was in rap promotions and production.

45
00:02:39,398 --> 00:02:42,999
I may give a couple stories there.

46
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:47,341
And I started at Origin Systems when we were coming out

47
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:50,122
of the beta on Ultima Online.

48
00:02:50,122 --> 00:02:53,804
97, when I started day one out of music, was as an audio

49
00:02:53,804 --> 00:02:54,164
intern.

50
00:02:54,923 --> 00:03:00,308
And about three weeks later, I started helping direct cinematics.

51
00:03:00,308 --> 00:03:01,930
Was there a question? Was there a...

52
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,673
I heard something in the corner of my eye or corner of my ear.

53
00:03:05,673 --> 00:03:10,498
And we moved from there into doing some help third-party style

54
00:03:10,498 --> 00:03:13,260
with other studios around the EA system.

55
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,242
Got to do things like go up to Dallas

56
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:18,365
and work with the American McGee's Alice team.

57
00:03:19,304 --> 00:03:21,745
and work with James Combat Simulations

58
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:24,806
where Andy Hollis had his group at Origin.

59
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:29,428
We've got actually a couple of other old school Origin people

60
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:31,509
in the audience right now that I can see.

61
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:32,529
So thanks for being here.

62
00:03:35,737 --> 00:03:39,820
So really for me what it boils down to is, as a producer,

63
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,743
what I'm trying to do all the time is to imagine the very,

64
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:47,685
very best possible outcome that I can and do everything

65
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,607
in my power to go after it.

66
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:52,689
And it doesn't matter where you are in the organization.

67
00:03:52,689 --> 00:03:55,130
If you are just getting your foot in the door,

68
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,112
if you're the EP on a project, if you're a dev director.

69
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:01,434
It really doesn't matter.

70
00:04:01,434 --> 00:04:03,334
I hope is your goal all the time.

71
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:05,375
You want to help your team achieve the

72
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,396
best possible success.

73
00:04:07,396 --> 00:04:09,917
You're not just trying to kind of cover your ass or do the

74
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:13,338
one thing that you got hired to do or make sure that your

75
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:16,039
next performance review, whatever your KPIs or metrics

76
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:18,920
are for the thing that you're going to be evaluated on, that

77
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,221
you're just focused on that.

78
00:04:20,221 --> 00:04:22,421
Really, the bigger goal is entertaining our customers.

79
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:26,248
and finding ways to manifest the best possible things.

80
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:31,352
That's what makes this really not just a tolerable thing

81
00:04:31,352 --> 00:04:33,974
to do for me, but something that I'm passionate about.

82
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:35,715
And I know that there are many others who

83
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:37,937
are passionate about production as well.

84
00:04:37,937 --> 00:04:39,959
However, we don't really have this kind

85
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:41,380
of discipline of production.

86
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,224
There aren't that many schools outside of management

87
00:04:46,224 --> 00:04:49,846
that really discuss what you do as a producer or a dev director.

88
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:55,511
It's something that most of us have just gained experience from being on the ground doing it.

89
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:58,593
And many of us came from other disciplines as well.

90
00:04:58,593 --> 00:04:59,454
So these are just my opinions, right?

91
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:06,479
These are just things that I've seen in my experience

92
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,642
and anecdotes from friends of mine who are in the industry.

93
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,438
But what I want is to give you work to do.

94
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:20,221
So hopefully you brought pen and paper, or we'll get access

95
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:21,282
to this later.

96
00:05:21,282 --> 00:05:25,945
Because actually what I want is for all of you to, as we're

97
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:28,968
going through this presentation, think of what

98
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:32,617
examples you would use to describe the things that we're

99
00:05:32,617 --> 00:05:36,420
going to talk about, what pictures that you would use to

100
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,521
quickly send a message about those things, and how you

101
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:42,223
would do this presentation yourself.

102
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:45,765
I'd love all of you, when you get home, to create this

103
00:05:45,765 --> 00:05:47,786
presentation for yourselves and do it.

104
00:05:47,786 --> 00:05:48,827
So steal it and do something cool with it.

105
00:05:57,252 --> 00:06:01,636
We're going to start out, before we get into how do you

106
00:06:01,636 --> 00:06:06,361
do the best possible, most awesome job as a producer, EP

107
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:08,183
in the industry.

108
00:06:08,183 --> 00:06:09,604
And really, we're going to stop a little

109
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:10,785
short of the EP side.

110
00:06:10,785 --> 00:06:12,387
We're not going to go deep into business.

111
00:06:12,387 --> 00:06:14,008
I know some of that was already talked about this

112
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:15,550
morning, about the economics of the industry.

113
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:23,621
I think in an hour we don't really have time to go fully into the executive producer side of things,

114
00:06:23,621 --> 00:06:29,285
but I'll give probably a few examples and if you have any questions when we have time, please ask them.

115
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:32,623
So coaching, opportunities for improvement.

116
00:06:32,623 --> 00:06:35,927
What I've done is I've pulled some actual coaching

117
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:37,789
statements from performance reviews

118
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:42,294
that I've given over the last eight, nine years at Gearbox,

119
00:06:42,294 --> 00:06:45,517
and thinking about some of the coaching moments

120
00:06:45,517 --> 00:06:49,261
that I've had before Gearbox, to start with some mistakes

121
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:51,184
that we see with junior producers,

122
00:06:51,184 --> 00:06:52,225
and with all producers.

123
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:56,587
So the first one is, and I drive this one home all the time,

124
00:06:56,587 --> 00:06:59,228
please don't be afraid to say that you don't know something.

125
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:03,630
Because it's the, when you never say you don't know,

126
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,410
if you are working with a team,

127
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,471
and you find yourself constantly feeling the need

128
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:11,212
to answer questions as though you really know the answer,

129
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:14,553
and you don't, you erode trust with the team.

130
00:07:14,553 --> 00:07:16,614
And when what you should be doing

131
00:07:16,614 --> 00:07:18,414
is everything you can to build trust,

132
00:07:18,414 --> 00:07:19,955
because you need to use that credibility,

133
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:21,395
you might have to cash it in later.

134
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:25,692
And so the economics of credibility and trust

135
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:29,853
are way more important than being the person who always has the answer.

136
00:07:29,853 --> 00:07:32,714
It's cool if you have the answer,

137
00:07:32,714 --> 00:07:35,454
but it's better if you, like everyone else,

138
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:38,935
are showing that you're just a human in the team.

139
00:07:38,935 --> 00:07:42,036
Some mistakes junior producers make have to do with opinions.

140
00:07:42,036 --> 00:07:47,197
The first one is, which may be a surprise to some of you,

141
00:07:47,197 --> 00:07:48,237
I feel a lot of...

142
00:07:49,523 --> 00:07:55,226
A lot of people in production roles in the industry feel they shouldn't give their opinion,

143
00:07:55,226 --> 00:08:00,408
even if they feel they have a valid backing, basis for their opinion.

144
00:08:00,408 --> 00:08:03,029
They don't speak up about it.

145
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:08,079
I think this stems from, and from those I've talked to when I've coached them,

146
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,560
it stems from feeling not empowered.

147
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,282
So if you are in a role where you don't feel empowered to speak up about things

148
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:15,984
that maybe you don't think are just in your purview,

149
00:08:15,984 --> 00:08:18,906
I think that you should address that with your lead

150
00:08:18,906 --> 00:08:21,447
or maybe just by revisiting who you are

151
00:08:21,447 --> 00:08:25,990
and what you're doing in your role in the industry.

152
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:28,812
I remember a time, actually when I was at Origin,

153
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:31,153
and we were working on Ultima Online 2.

154
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:36,316
And I felt like messaging, there wasn't enough information

155
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,556
going around the studio about what was

156
00:08:37,556 --> 00:08:38,377
happening with the title.

157
00:08:38,377 --> 00:08:42,279
And I felt like there wasn't enough leadership on that

158
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,560
project amongst all the leads.

159
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,942
There's some people who are awesome, especially the vision

160
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:50,082
of what the project was going to be.

161
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,691
But when the rubber really hit the road, from my

162
00:08:52,691 --> 00:08:55,192
perspective anyway, I wasn't getting enough information.

163
00:08:55,192 --> 00:08:58,113
And I wished, in retrospect, after that project was shut

164
00:08:58,113 --> 00:09:02,654
down, that I had gone to that senior producer and had a talk

165
00:09:02,654 --> 00:09:03,095
with him.

166
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:07,096
He quickly left to go run another studio.

167
00:09:07,096 --> 00:09:11,497
But I realized later why my boss, who was the head of the

168
00:09:11,497 --> 00:09:14,558
we were in this team called the Rave Group, stood for

169
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:15,959
radical audiovisual experience.

170
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:18,400
We were responsible for cinematics and storytelling

171
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,100
and did technical animation and art.

172
00:09:20,592 --> 00:09:22,093
and all the audio for our games.

173
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:26,276
Why he stuck a potato in that person's monitor

174
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:28,518
and left it there for four months,

175
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:31,160
not realizing that guy was on the way out the door.

176
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,522
It was kind of his passive aggressive stance

177
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:35,444
to speaking up when he didn't feel empowered.

178
00:09:35,444 --> 00:09:37,625
I understood what that was later.

179
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:40,708
It was funny at the time that there was a potato

180
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,389
in the guy's monitor, though.

181
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:45,071
So don't be the person who puts a potato in a monitor,

182
00:09:45,071 --> 00:09:45,592
is my point.

183
00:09:47,107 --> 00:09:50,729
This one is the more common one that you hear.

184
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:53,512
Offering an opinion when unqualified.

185
00:09:53,512 --> 00:09:54,873
Look, here's the thing.

186
00:09:54,873 --> 00:09:57,995
If you're in a team, if you're in a bigger team especially,

187
00:09:57,995 --> 00:10:01,318
and that team has hired designers

188
00:10:01,318 --> 00:10:04,681
to come into design roles on your team,

189
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:08,704
please don't usurp the authority and responsibility

190
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:10,465
of those designers on your teams

191
00:10:10,465 --> 00:10:12,367
by constantly offering design opinions.

192
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:14,048
I love that you have design opinions,

193
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:15,369
if you have them and you're offering them.

194
00:10:15,938 --> 00:10:21,443
just make sure that you're helping the team use their time most wisely

195
00:10:21,443 --> 00:10:24,286
and boosting the cred of the people around you

196
00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:32,352
by giving them the responsibility of having and pushing forward those opinions.

197
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:35,715
I actually, every year, I have at least one moment

198
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:38,718
where I have to coach a new producer on this one.

199
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:45,537
and then not asking other so this is goes hand in hand obviously with not

200
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:49,262
you know kind of not speaking up or not feeling empowered but not not asking

201
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:52,565
others for their opinion not asking enough questions not being curious

202
00:10:52,565 --> 00:10:54,768
enough what I'm looking for.

203
00:10:55,385 --> 00:10:58,767
really, especially with newer producers or people who are really curious.

204
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:06,053
It becomes very helpful when you are uncovering the unknowns in your designs

205
00:11:06,053 --> 00:11:10,016
to have curious people around you, especially producers who are responsible

206
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:14,039
for understanding the scope of work that is being proposed.

207
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,901
And so when you don't ask a lot of questions,

208
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:19,623
and people for their opinions about the validity of things,

209
00:11:19,623 --> 00:11:22,485
the goodness of things, how deep problems are

210
00:11:22,485 --> 00:11:25,687
going to be in things, then you're not helping your team

211
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:26,788
as much as you could.

212
00:11:26,788 --> 00:11:27,128
Self-control.

213
00:11:27,128 --> 00:11:36,875
Once in a while, and this goes for all team members,

214
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:41,038
but it really hurts me when I see it

215
00:11:41,038 --> 00:11:42,659
from someone who's in production.

216
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,824
your team's looking to you to be a leader,

217
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:53,312
to be someone who sets the tone for adult behavior

218
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,875
and professionalism in the team, usually.

219
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:59,180
We want that of all members of our teams.

220
00:12:00,757 --> 00:12:03,119
you know, my discipline now is in production,

221
00:12:03,119 --> 00:12:05,060
so I can't control, per se,

222
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,162
or give that same message to all other disciplines.

223
00:12:07,162 --> 00:12:09,024
I'll say, if you're in production,

224
00:12:09,024 --> 00:12:12,687
I'm hoping that you are consciously

225
00:12:12,687 --> 00:12:14,589
practicing self-control.

226
00:12:14,589 --> 00:12:15,750
There's a lot of ways to do that.

227
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,972
We're not going to go into kind of all methods

228
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:20,034
for all things here.

229
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:21,655
I will ask you that you practice this.

230
00:12:23,783 --> 00:12:29,407
is an obvious one. However, a lot of times we see information being disseminated through

231
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:34,109
electronic means that needs to be given face to face. Any time you coach somebody, I hope

232
00:12:34,109 --> 00:12:38,052
that is face to face. Never coach anybody over email or on a phone call.

233
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:43,919
It can wait, unless it's disastrous, it can wait until you're face-to-face.

234
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:47,283
Also, great news is best delivered face-to-face.

235
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:52,871
It's way more impactful and you can also use it as a moment to coach in a positive direction,

236
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:54,373
not just away from a negative direction.

237
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:02,024
There's kind of damned if you do, damned if you don't things.

238
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:05,586
There are a lot of these gotchas.

239
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:08,247
So rather than say it's a failure

240
00:13:08,247 --> 00:13:11,768
to make a decision before you have all the information.

241
00:13:11,768 --> 00:13:13,209
I could have said that.

242
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,370
But instead what I'll say is that the failure is not

243
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,611
recognizing what the best alternative is.

244
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:21,192
You have to make decisions within complete information.

245
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:21,833
It's part of your job.

246
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:24,754
You're going to try to uncover all the information you can.

247
00:13:25,115 --> 00:13:28,202
But really, you're going to have to make a lot of decisions

248
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:29,425
with incomplete information.

249
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:31,911
So you might favor making a decision

250
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:34,357
towards something that you can easily recover from.

251
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:38,548
That's always a good direction to go if you have the time to recover.

252
00:13:38,548 --> 00:13:44,211
Taking too long to make a decision, well, there are some that can stand to wait.

253
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:49,054
There are some things that are painful to make bad decisions with, whether it's hiring

254
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:54,617
the wrong person or making some feature decision to do a back-of-the-box check.

255
00:13:55,117 --> 00:13:59,843
on, you know, for your product as opposed to ensuring that your team can really deliver

256
00:13:59,843 --> 00:14:04,409
on that thing that you're discussing. So make sure that you're weighing the pros

257
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:08,634
and cons across, across competitive decisions. So along the same lines of, you know, the

258
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:17,933
professionalism that we were talking about before.

259
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:22,236
The baseline that you set is really important, and you have

260
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,557
to be intentional about it.

261
00:14:23,557 --> 00:14:26,419
You can't just be, hey, it's just me, and I'm on the team,

262
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:28,701
and people have to accept me for who I am.

263
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,862
Fuck that as a producer.

264
00:14:29,862 --> 00:14:32,624
I want you to be who you are, and I want you to be

265
00:14:32,624 --> 00:14:34,125
comfortable in your own skin.

266
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,847
But you are establishing a baseline.

267
00:14:35,847 --> 00:14:38,088
And everything that you do that deviates away from that

268
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:40,810
baseline is going to be hugely impactful, especially as your

269
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,411
teams grow.

270
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:45,869
So you have to be intentional about what that baseline is.

271
00:14:45,869 --> 00:14:49,172
If you come in and you kind of have this schizo behavior

272
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:52,235
because you're passionate about a lot of things

273
00:14:52,235 --> 00:14:53,136
and you're all over the map.

274
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:57,309
OK, you might be passionate and you'll be around as, say,

275
00:14:57,309 --> 00:14:59,329
assistant or associate producer for a while,

276
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:02,371
but you're not going to be in a leadership capacity

277
00:15:02,371 --> 00:15:03,591
with that sort of behavior.

278
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:06,553
And I don't see anybody in here who strikes me that way.

279
00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:08,493
But I've seen it and had to coach people out

280
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:11,275
of companies I've been at as a result of it.

281
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:13,556
Where they're baseline in is really important,

282
00:15:13,556 --> 00:15:15,657
and you have to be reliable in that way.

283
00:15:15,657 --> 00:15:17,297
Now here's the thing, though.

284
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:21,139
Because you've established this baseline,

285
00:15:21,139 --> 00:15:24,060
then you can be intentional about when you use emotion.

286
00:15:24,995 --> 00:15:29,956
There are times when I want to see you use maybe a lot of emotion

287
00:15:29,956 --> 00:15:33,837
in order to be super impactful on the things that really matter for your teams.

288
00:15:33,837 --> 00:15:39,658
You guys know about Maslow's hierarchy of needs?

289
00:15:39,658 --> 00:15:42,039
Yeah, you've heard about this a lot of times.

290
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:44,779
You've probably heard other talks about it, studied it in school, whatever.

291
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:49,320
It's funny how often this really, truly comes up in a studio environment.

292
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,321
Whether it's something as simple as food, or the AC isn't working.

293
00:15:54,062 --> 00:15:59,584
the heater's not working, whatever it is, you have to decide how you're going to escalate

294
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:05,167
your response to things that actually directly impact that foundation of what people need.

295
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:09,989
Once you've established a calm baseline, when you see things that might impact your team

296
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:15,391
physiologically, psychologically, things that impact their safety, if you hear about, hey,

297
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,593
cars are getting broken into in the parking lot, and

298
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,813
You know, you're in an environment where

299
00:16:22,813 --> 00:16:26,056
you might have street lamps that are going out, whatever.

300
00:16:26,056 --> 00:16:29,979
You have to be the one to care about the team enough

301
00:16:29,979 --> 00:16:34,483
to escalate in a way that others understand

302
00:16:34,483 --> 00:16:36,285
how much of a problem those things are.

303
00:16:36,285 --> 00:16:38,567
And as a producer, this is really squarely in line

304
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,008
with the things you have to care about.

305
00:16:40,008 --> 00:16:40,048
So...

306
00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:49,500
Professionalism, you know, we're in games.

307
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,123
I understand we're not in a corporate environment.

308
00:16:52,123 --> 00:16:58,088
It's cool, but I'll say, I'll give another origin example.

309
00:16:58,088 --> 00:17:03,113
We had this stupid, terrible thing we used to do, which was

310
00:17:03,113 --> 00:17:04,915
a mandatory happy hour.

311
00:17:04,915 --> 00:17:10,820
And it started when the company was small, and it

312
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,002
continued when the company got big.

313
00:17:14,152 --> 00:17:17,715
And I saw two different marriages get wrecked over the

314
00:17:17,715 --> 00:17:21,538
fact that we had this forced socialized thing happening.

315
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:27,283
You have to be really, really mindful of how long do you

316
00:17:27,283 --> 00:17:29,445
want to be in the industry and what kind of reputation do you

317
00:17:29,445 --> 00:17:30,806
want to have and leave behind.

318
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:33,929
So things like dating co-workers, again, whatever.

319
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:36,211
Whatever your company policy is.

320
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:36,691
It's cool.

321
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:42,859
Keep in mind though once you start having those relationships grow in the

322
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:46,322
office environment through the stress that you're probably going to experience

323
00:17:46,322 --> 00:17:49,804
on the kind of projects that we see all across the industry these days,

324
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:52,046
you know, that can really impact

325
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:56,910
things in the game and in your life and I don't want you to go through the kind

326
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,891
of things that I saw in those

327
00:17:57,891 --> 00:18:00,753
days that we had 20 years ago.

328
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:05,016
It's not okay to say offensive things.

329
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:12,816
Like, it's not OK to, like, I don't want us to have to be too PC in the industry.

330
00:18:12,816 --> 00:18:13,477
I curse a lot.

331
00:18:13,477 --> 00:18:18,460
I use a lot of references that people would, you know, that I wouldn't use maybe at home

332
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:23,984
with my mom or, you know, or with my family at home.

333
00:18:23,984 --> 00:18:29,448
At the same time, though, you have to be really aware of who your coworkers are, and you want

334
00:18:29,448 --> 00:18:31,609
to boost them up and make them feel great.

335
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:41,684
Likewise, I also want you to keep in mind,

336
00:18:41,684 --> 00:18:44,330
and I'll only stay on this one for a second,

337
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:44,410
that

338
00:18:45,807 --> 00:18:48,088
When you're, this is especially for junior,

339
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:51,590
really new producers, because you'll wash yourself of this

340
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,171
if you're gonna stay in the industry at all,

341
00:18:53,171 --> 00:18:54,991
is that, and anything that you bring

342
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:57,432
into the office environment, first of all,

343
00:18:57,432 --> 00:19:00,374
you wanna keep any stress and negativity you're having

344
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:01,915
from things happening in your personal life,

345
00:19:01,915 --> 00:19:03,755
leave that outside the doors before you get

346
00:19:03,755 --> 00:19:05,676
into your studio or with your team.

347
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:09,478
Beyond that, most of the people on your team

348
00:19:09,478 --> 00:19:11,559
don't really wanna hear about whatever's going on

349
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:13,760
in your personal life, whatever your drama is.

350
00:19:15,607 --> 00:19:20,070
But you should use whatever strength you can draw from your personal life, whatever experiences

351
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:20,591
you've had there.

352
00:19:20,591 --> 00:19:21,391
Talk about those.

353
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:25,374
Talk about the positive things that might be good examples for the team to know why

354
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:28,856
they should believe in you and why you have strength and what you bring to them.

355
00:19:31,673 --> 00:19:36,056
This is one that I, ah man, probably two or three times a year I have to coach somebody

356
00:19:36,056 --> 00:19:37,457
in this one.

357
00:19:37,457 --> 00:19:43,460
Too much importance put on titles, on using somebody's new title or role or promotion

358
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,442
as a way to get what they want or enforce something or feel like now they have, they're

359
00:19:47,442 --> 00:19:52,045
supposed to enforce more of what they want onto the team.

360
00:19:52,865 --> 00:19:58,527
Maybe you move into a role like a producer at EA.

361
00:19:58,527 --> 00:20:01,427
Some of you might be here in that particular role

362
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:03,428
where you do have some design

363
00:20:03,428 --> 00:20:05,468
or quality responsibility for the title,

364
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:06,889
and so cool, that's your job.

365
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:10,609
But I see whether it's at Gearbox

366
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:13,030
or with teams that we're working with in other studios,

367
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:13,850
this happened a lot.

368
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,211
So we try to have a more flat meritocracy-style culture

369
00:20:18,211 --> 00:20:21,452
in our studio where titles don't mean as much.

370
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:22,012
And...

371
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:27,795
I have one guy who decided that he wanted his title to be a minister of art.

372
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:29,836
I said, what the fuck is a minister of art?

373
00:20:29,836 --> 00:20:33,917
He said, all I really want to do is help us hire the best people,

374
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:37,339
and I think that having that title makes me feel good about doing it.

375
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:38,760
All right, cool.

376
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,041
I'm going to call you an HR advisor,

377
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,562
and you can tell other people you are whatever you want.

378
00:20:46,473 --> 00:20:51,016
But this can get in the way of good feelings between team

379
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,937
members when titles start to matter too much.

380
00:20:53,937 --> 00:20:54,297
You guys know that.

381
00:20:54,297 --> 00:20:59,320
Something that I mentioned earlier is this sort of

382
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,262
currency in economics of credibility.

383
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:03,303
Once you start spending your credibility.

384
00:21:04,357 --> 00:21:08,238
You have to build it up again before you can start spending it again.

385
00:21:08,238 --> 00:21:14,220
And these tend to be on decisions where there's no clear answer, but you have an agenda behind

386
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,981
the thing that you want, and so you're willing to spend that credibility that you have.

387
00:21:17,981 --> 00:21:21,462
And you have to be very careful about how and when you spend it, especially if it's

388
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:26,404
something where others are pulling you to spend it on their behalf.

389
00:21:26,404 --> 00:21:29,785
You can get yourself in a situation very quickly where you've spent it all.

390
00:21:29,785 --> 00:21:32,146
It's like, you know, like you're spending it on a credit card.

391
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:39,467
So, the way to combat that is make sure that your decisions are yours.

392
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:44,728
That you really, really truly believe in the things that you want and that you're willing

393
00:21:44,728 --> 00:21:45,168
to go to bat for.

394
00:21:45,168 --> 00:21:53,130
This is really common, and this is something that as you grow as leaders, I want you to

395
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:54,310
think about a lot.

396
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,431
You have to see yourself as a leader.

397
00:21:56,431 --> 00:22:00,231
It can be very difficult for us to see ourselves in that way.

398
00:22:00,912 --> 00:22:04,213
a lot of us in the industry stay in the industry

399
00:22:04,213 --> 00:22:06,774
or got into it because we didn't want to be

400
00:22:06,774 --> 00:22:08,455
an executive manager at a company

401
00:22:08,455 --> 00:22:11,997
or go down some other path that felt maybe more corporate

402
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,817
or whatever to us, right?

403
00:22:13,817 --> 00:22:16,599
So I want you to see yourself as a leader.

404
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:18,960
That is part of your discipline in production

405
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,780
and then practice things towards that.

406
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,641
We'll get to that in a second.

407
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:24,605
I'll only be on this one for a second.

408
00:22:24,605 --> 00:22:27,788
About two months ago, I had, this is actually,

409
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:31,191
trying to be too cool was a line in somebody's review.

410
00:22:31,191 --> 00:22:33,173
It wasn't a review that I gave,

411
00:22:33,173 --> 00:22:35,015
it was a review somebody else gave.

412
00:22:35,015 --> 00:22:38,398
I won't tell you which of these three things was the issue,

413
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:42,301
but it was a new person who just really wanted to fit in,

414
00:22:42,301 --> 00:22:45,164
and I hope you don't find yourself

415
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,265
in any of these situations.

416
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:49,007
Don't be that person, though.

417
00:22:49,007 --> 00:22:49,628
You won't last long.

418
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,944
So this is a big problem that I'm frustrated that I have

419
00:22:56,944 --> 00:23:01,067
coached someone for a couple years now who, in every other

420
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:03,809
aspect of what they do, is great.

421
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:07,892
But this is one that keeps coming up time and again,

422
00:23:07,892 --> 00:23:14,458
which is you might be someone who's terrific at

423
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:16,242
getting along with the team,

424
00:23:16,242 --> 00:23:18,005
you know, working through tasks in JIRA,

425
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:20,930
whatever task management system you use.

426
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:23,895
Like, you're really competent and capable

427
00:23:23,895 --> 00:23:24,816
in a lot of areas,

428
00:23:24,816 --> 00:23:27,621
but the little things keep falling through the cracks.

429
00:23:28,726 --> 00:23:32,229
And this is the one that will absolutely prevent you, well at least if you're working with

430
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:36,552
me, but this is one that will absolutely prevent you from being promoted.

431
00:23:36,552 --> 00:23:41,395
You can go from foot in the door, assistant, associate producer.

432
00:23:41,395 --> 00:23:46,699
But to move from associate producer to a full project producer, this won't fly.

433
00:23:46,699 --> 00:23:51,863
And once you've shown that you have a penchance for letting things fall through the cracks,

434
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:55,245
it's going to take a couple of shipping cycles.

435
00:23:55,926 --> 00:23:57,346
or if you're in a live environment,

436
00:23:57,346 --> 00:23:59,027
whatever your live cycles are,

437
00:23:59,027 --> 00:24:01,249
it's going to take a few of those

438
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:06,171
to gain back the credibility that you need

439
00:24:06,171 --> 00:24:08,373
to be able to get yourself in a position

440
00:24:08,373 --> 00:24:10,234
to have that promotion again,

441
00:24:10,234 --> 00:24:11,855
or for others to see you as someone

442
00:24:11,855 --> 00:24:17,238
who can be in that kind of role of responsibility.

443
00:24:17,917 --> 00:24:26,781
make sure, especially if you're told at some point that something got by you, that you

444
00:24:26,781 --> 00:24:32,024
don't let any of those details get by. All of these are very important kinds of things

445
00:24:32,024 --> 00:24:36,206
that have actually happened recently with me.

446
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:43,150
How many of us get frustrated about being in meetings where people just always seem

447
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:47,052
to take notes and nothing happens with those notes? Am I the only one?

448
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,084
Yeah.

449
00:24:52,084 --> 00:24:55,328
So to move this from a negative thought

450
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:58,292
into more positive thoughts, I hope

451
00:24:58,292 --> 00:25:00,855
everybody is turning everything that's happening in meetings

452
00:25:00,855 --> 00:25:02,577
into actionable items.

453
00:25:02,577 --> 00:25:05,200
You have to measure those, because people only

454
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,502
do the things that they're measured in.

455
00:25:07,718 --> 00:25:10,801
Over time, if we feel like the thing we're doing is of no use,

456
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:14,104
because it's not being measured, nobody remembers that I actually

457
00:25:14,104 --> 00:25:17,126
turned that stuff in that meeting into action items,

458
00:25:17,126 --> 00:25:20,289
then I can easily fall back into the trap of just sitting there

459
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:22,872
scrawling crap on a piece of paper.

460
00:25:22,872 --> 00:25:26,155
So if you have people working for you who are note-takers

461
00:25:26,155 --> 00:25:28,136
in meetings, or if you're the note-taker, designated

462
00:25:28,136 --> 00:25:30,799
note-taker, whatever, make sure that others know you're

463
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:31,780
constantly following up.

464
00:25:34,722 --> 00:25:35,863
This one kills me.

465
00:25:35,863 --> 00:25:38,604
Meetings with topics but no agendas.

466
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:41,286
It goes hand in hand with not having action items and

467
00:25:41,286 --> 00:25:41,726
follow-up.

468
00:25:41,726 --> 00:25:42,866
Just fix your meetings.

469
00:25:42,866 --> 00:25:45,648
There's a lot of thinking out there about how meetings

470
00:25:45,648 --> 00:25:46,968
should be held.

471
00:25:46,968 --> 00:25:48,849
But just fix your meetings if you're having

472
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:49,810
these kind of issues.

473
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,270
Dear God, please.

474
00:25:52,643 --> 00:25:55,846
And in fact, I'll give a quick note about that last one.

475
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:58,188
I wanted to train my production staff at the studio.

476
00:25:58,188 --> 00:26:04,373
I now have, I probably have 25 or so producers at my round

477
00:26:04,373 --> 00:26:04,893
table, maybe 30.

478
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:10,078
I wanted to train them that my expectation of producers at

479
00:26:10,078 --> 00:26:13,601
Gearbox is for them to be responsible as a peer group to

480
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:16,183
solve their problems before they ever get to me or anybody

481
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:20,106
else who is going to have to then sort out

482
00:26:20,106 --> 00:26:21,167
noise from the signal.

483
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:21,767
And.

484
00:26:22,528 --> 00:26:31,552
To train them in that, when I began assembling this new group of producers, I told them first,

485
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:36,173
because I like to use dramatic language to convey simple points, I hate meetings.

486
00:26:36,173 --> 00:26:43,116
So never call me to a meeting unless there's a great expected value to come out of it,

487
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:49,519
and only if it's almost a last resort because something couldn't get worked out between yourselves first.

488
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:54,645
And the outcome of that approach, of course,

489
00:26:54,645 --> 00:26:58,610
I also gave examples of how I wanted these meetings

490
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,134
to be conducted to get those results,

491
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:03,977
was the most junior producer, one of,

492
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:07,162
one of the more junior producers in our studio,

493
00:27:08,604 --> 00:27:11,487
now runs these producer roundtable meetings

494
00:27:11,487 --> 00:27:14,270
where all the important stuff that has to get sorted out

495
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:18,034
between producers happens at these roundtables.

496
00:27:18,034 --> 00:27:21,398
No executive managers, no executive producers

497
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:23,581
go to these meetings, that's by design.

498
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,824
And I've had requests from other executives, hey, can I go to these meetings, hear more

499
00:27:28,824 --> 00:27:29,645
about what's happening?

500
00:27:29,645 --> 00:27:33,929
Well, no, because if you do that, they're not going to have the discussion they need

501
00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:34,389
between them.

502
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:40,955
So what I want is I want that healthy peer community to be established in a studio, especially

503
00:27:40,955 --> 00:27:42,196
at our size and bigger.

504
00:27:42,196 --> 00:27:46,800
I mean, we're small compared to maybe what if any of you are from, say, Ubisoft Montreal

505
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,642
or any of the larger studios.

506
00:27:48,642 --> 00:27:49,122
But even so.

507
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:53,826
there has to be a healthy community of practice amongst producers.

508
00:27:53,826 --> 00:27:56,068
You can't do that when everybody's just working in their silo.

509
00:27:56,068 --> 00:28:06,337
On Borderlands 2, Sean Reardon, who's the senior producer on the project and I sat down

510
00:28:06,337 --> 00:28:12,302
and we were trying to figure out, because there were some things happening around the schedule,

511
00:28:12,302 --> 00:28:13,843
as always happens on any project.

512
00:28:14,264 --> 00:28:15,925
What's the formula?

513
00:28:15,925 --> 00:28:19,487
Actually, we started this discussion way back early in Borderlands 1 even.

514
00:28:19,487 --> 00:28:21,869
What's the formula for quality?

515
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:27,392
What we care about is quality, and we're a meritocracy, and we need to create a compelling

516
00:28:27,392 --> 00:28:30,494
argument about why we need to get more time for something.

517
00:28:30,494 --> 00:28:31,515
How do we do that?

518
00:28:31,515 --> 00:28:36,558
Well, quality results from focus and time.

519
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:40,501
We need to use these words and then turn them into something actionable as a studio for

520
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:41,661
how we organize ourselves.

521
00:28:44,245 --> 00:28:47,708
Quick thing I'll say there is anything that distracts from

522
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:49,669
focus is negative.

523
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:52,932
So if you have people who are spending a lot of time

524
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:56,174
streaming, if you're doing that, if taking a lot of smoke

525
00:28:56,174 --> 00:28:59,657
breaks, whatever, while that might not feel like a big deal

526
00:28:59,657 --> 00:29:03,399
on a day-to-day basis, you're creating a lot of debt over

527
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:05,321
time that has to be paid.

528
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:08,003
And that's something that you have to reinforce with a

529
00:29:08,003 --> 00:29:09,864
message with your team all the time.

530
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:12,586
You can only do that, first of all, if you are setting a good

531
00:29:12,586 --> 00:29:12,907
example.

532
00:29:17,276 --> 00:29:20,840
Giving a heads up, so the military has this term Werno,

533
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,022
a warning order.

534
00:29:22,022 --> 00:29:24,024
It's, hey, I'm about to tell you something's going to

535
00:29:24,024 --> 00:29:25,906
happen, here's the thing I'm going to tell you, and then

536
00:29:25,906 --> 00:29:27,168
the actual order comes later.

537
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,991
And you have to remind people all the time that.

538
00:29:30,863 --> 00:29:33,444
there was a discussion about something that might require

539
00:29:33,444 --> 00:29:36,725
them to do work, they have to be prepared to do that work.

540
00:29:36,725 --> 00:29:39,585
Because if you don't do that, you have situations where,

541
00:29:39,585 --> 00:29:42,326
especially with leads who are really busy, they, I don't

542
00:29:42,326 --> 00:29:44,446
remember that ever being discussed, or I don't remember

543
00:29:44,446 --> 00:29:46,506
that being a thing I had to prepare work for, and I didn't

544
00:29:46,506 --> 00:29:49,767
create that job posting, and I didn't do the spec for that

545
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:51,147
thing that had to happen.

546
00:29:51,147 --> 00:29:55,488
So you have to keep this cadence of information so that

547
00:29:55,488 --> 00:29:57,048
people remember there's a thing that they're

548
00:29:57,048 --> 00:29:58,028
going to have to do.

549
00:29:58,208 --> 00:29:59,509
By the way, I want to remind you,

550
00:29:59,509 --> 00:30:01,591
I want you to give this talk, or a version of it,

551
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,132
for yourselves when you get home.

552
00:30:04,132 --> 00:30:11,537
And so think about what examples you can use for these.

553
00:30:11,537 --> 00:30:15,059
It's strange, but I think this happens

554
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:15,819
in a culture where.

555
00:30:16,676 --> 00:30:20,217
performance reviews don't happen regularly,

556
00:30:20,217 --> 00:30:22,317
that we forget part of our job is

557
00:30:22,317 --> 00:30:24,657
to supervise what's happening.

558
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:26,778
We're not just information handlers.

559
00:30:26,778 --> 00:30:29,278
We actually are responsible for the quality and result

560
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:31,119
of the product that we're working on.

561
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:34,719
And so supervision for a junior, and this

562
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:37,320
is more geared towards junior producers,

563
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:41,020
while I don't want you to act like you're the boss,

564
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,401
I do want you to remember that you have a responsibility here.

565
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:43,461
So.

566
00:30:45,374 --> 00:30:47,275
It's an easy one, just don't be negligent.

567
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:51,097
Well, what happens next when we start to abdicate our

568
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:55,899
authority in the role that we do have is we might do things

569
00:30:55,899 --> 00:30:58,020
like a very bad job at expectation management.

570
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,722
Now, this ranges across all kinds of things.

571
00:31:00,722 --> 00:31:03,803
And unfortunately, it can become part of our culture if

572
00:31:03,803 --> 00:31:06,645
we're not careful, just the topic of poor expectation

573
00:31:06,645 --> 00:31:07,465
management.

574
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:10,487
We see it in things like press tours, where we might say

575
00:31:10,487 --> 00:31:11,968
things about products that.

576
00:31:12,548 --> 00:31:15,629
We're correct at one time and then later didn't, we're not so correct.

577
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:20,251
Or it might become something about what a role is, what we expect of people in their

578
00:31:20,251 --> 00:31:21,872
roles.

579
00:31:21,872 --> 00:31:26,434
It can be something about what the focus of our project is at the time, whether it's time

580
00:31:26,434 --> 00:31:26,834
or quality.

581
00:31:26,834 --> 00:31:29,015
You have to manage your triangle, right?

582
00:31:29,015 --> 00:31:33,476
And the triangle of time, quality.

583
00:31:34,695 --> 00:31:39,377
and money as something that you're responsible for managing,

584
00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:41,478
you have to know which of those is,

585
00:31:41,478 --> 00:31:44,440
there's always something that's a priority, okay?

586
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,561
You can't have everything be the highest priority.

587
00:31:46,561 --> 00:31:50,022
And expectation management is knowing what the priorities are

588
00:31:50,022 --> 00:31:51,323
and clearly communicating those.

589
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:52,823
And that can be caused,

590
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:55,404
one of the things is having unchecked assumptions.

591
00:31:55,404 --> 00:32:00,747
And I had to counsel somebody about six months ago,

592
00:32:00,747 --> 00:32:02,988
kind of hand in hand with things getting through the cracks.

593
00:32:03,926 --> 00:32:08,127
not doing a very good job of actually checking information.

594
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:11,668
So we know that in a communication model,

595
00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:14,429
there's the signal that's transmitted.

596
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:17,169
Well, if you want to know if communications really happen,

597
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:19,930
I did a talk on this last year, so let me touch on it here.

598
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,810
You want to make sure that communication was actually

599
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,551
received in the way that you intended it.

600
00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:25,851
And that is your responsibility.

601
00:32:25,851 --> 00:32:27,252
And it's funny to me how often.

602
00:32:29,053 --> 00:32:32,715
where it's easy for us to transmit communication.

603
00:32:32,715 --> 00:32:35,657
We're so willing to transmit communication,

604
00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:37,538
but we do a terrible job at making sure

605
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,160
that that communication actually happened

606
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,041
and that the signal went through

607
00:32:42,041 --> 00:32:44,762
and that the message was heard and is being acted on

608
00:32:44,762 --> 00:32:45,383
in the way that we intended.

609
00:32:45,383 --> 00:32:46,463
So I'm saying it's hard, it's not easy.

610
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,861
Don't distribute your attention too much.

611
00:32:55,861 --> 00:32:59,042
It's easy for us to make too many commitments once.

612
00:32:59,042 --> 00:33:00,243
You can go too far, right?

613
00:33:00,243 --> 00:33:02,404
You can say, I'm going to enable the team to do everything.

614
00:33:02,404 --> 00:33:05,045
And then it's very, very quickly, easily,

615
00:33:05,045 --> 00:33:06,426
something we can fall into as a trap.

616
00:33:09,284 --> 00:33:12,706
We're getting close to wrapping up the failure part of this.

617
00:33:12,706 --> 00:33:16,249
So failure to deal with the producer's dilemma.

618
00:33:16,249 --> 00:33:18,350
This happens all the time.

619
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,793
When you have somebody in a seat and you think, man, if I

620
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:24,594
coach that person, I only have that one person who can do

621
00:33:24,594 --> 00:33:26,556
that thing, whatever it is.

622
00:33:26,556 --> 00:33:28,997
This might be my cert or platform specialist.

623
00:33:28,997 --> 00:33:32,220
Or hell, it could be the lead designer of the project.

624
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,040
Could be anybody.

625
00:33:34,201 --> 00:33:41,863
When we fall into the trap of having to keep that one person, it could be that one bad seed that spoils the water, that poisons it for everybody.

626
00:33:41,863 --> 00:33:47,405
Poisoning the well, I see less of it these days in the industry, but it sure as hell still happens.

627
00:33:47,405 --> 00:33:54,047
I see a lot more qualified people, and we have grown a lot, which is good, but we still fall into this dilemma.

628
00:33:54,047 --> 00:33:58,168
And as a producer, you have to be kind of at the front lines of dealing with it.

629
00:34:04,154 --> 00:34:10,279
Candor and conflict in the industry, you're not everybody's buddy, right?

630
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:12,180
You're not here to make friends with everyone.

631
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:15,603
And your team needs to know that you're going to be straightforward with them.

632
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:21,027
Because the second that they start feeling that you're full of shit, you've lost your

633
00:34:21,027 --> 00:34:22,368
credibility and your trust.

634
00:34:22,368 --> 00:34:26,271
And they know you're no longer able to be candid with them.

635
00:34:26,271 --> 00:34:28,933
They'll feel that you're trying to politic with them.

636
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:33,657
When you move from candor to politics, you've lost the team.

637
00:34:34,582 --> 00:34:39,405
And you need to know when that might happen and avoid that danger.

638
00:34:39,405 --> 00:34:46,609
I've worked in environments where there's a lot of politics happening, especially when

639
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:46,849
I was.

640
00:34:47,408 --> 00:34:50,712
working with the military or back when I was working in music,

641
00:34:50,712 --> 00:34:53,034
there's a lot of politics happening all the time

642
00:34:53,034 --> 00:34:59,982
because there are scarcity in jobs or scarcity in attention.

643
00:34:59,982 --> 00:35:03,947
And once you get yourself into a role

644
00:35:03,947 --> 00:35:07,651
where you can make sure there's a lot of attention you can give to members of your team,

645
00:35:08,071 --> 00:35:10,273
or a lot of jobs that you can provide,

646
00:35:10,273 --> 00:35:12,955
or coaching moments that you can have with them,

647
00:35:12,955 --> 00:35:15,657
you know, you can do away with some of the politics.

648
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:17,599
But you have to be direct with people,

649
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,460
or else they'll feel that you're full of shit,

650
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,441
and they can't trust you.

651
00:35:20,441 --> 00:35:22,162
And then it's much harder for you to do your job,

652
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,583
and you probably won't be in your job very long.

653
00:35:23,583 --> 00:35:24,604
So this is kind of the complement to that.

654
00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:36,019
That will happen, it can happen if you're not comfortable with being direct with people.

655
00:35:36,019 --> 00:35:40,283
If you have fear, it's okay to be afraid, but you have to practice being candid.

656
00:35:40,283 --> 00:35:43,065
A lot of people have to practice that.

657
00:35:43,065 --> 00:35:45,867
It's not something that's natural to everyone.

658
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:49,511
So hopefully you're in an environment where you can practice that, but you have to find

659
00:35:49,511 --> 00:35:50,531
opportunities to practice.

660
00:35:50,531 --> 00:35:50,792
Don't ever lie.

661
00:35:55,144 --> 00:35:58,746
So moving from there, that's sort of a crawl walk phase.

662
00:35:58,746 --> 00:36:03,968
I'm going to talk about the things that I think make for

663
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,808
super producers.

664
00:36:04,808 --> 00:36:07,129
Again, not quite at the business EP level.

665
00:36:07,129 --> 00:36:08,450
There's a little bit of that.

666
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:14,232
But between myself and the senior producers I work with

667
00:36:14,232 --> 00:36:16,393
at Gearbox, and some at the publishers we work with,

668
00:36:16,393 --> 00:36:21,035
here's a few qualities that I'd like to see you all

669
00:36:21,035 --> 00:36:23,156
practice and think about intentionally.

670
00:36:23,956 --> 00:36:27,938
So here's the first one.

671
00:36:27,938 --> 00:36:29,779
You have to be the person now.

672
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:33,721
Say you're moving from junior producer or mid-level producer

673
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:34,442
into senior producer.

674
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,543
You're the person responsible for the project for the team,

675
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:41,786
or you're enabled by your lead to be one of those people.

676
00:36:41,786 --> 00:36:43,227
Bad things have to stop.

677
00:36:44,095 --> 00:36:46,016
And you have to go through a practice.

678
00:36:46,016 --> 00:36:48,858
You should go through a process on a milestone basis,

679
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:51,399
some regular basis, where you are evaluating.

680
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:54,141
You might do this as a mid-mortem, a post-mortem,

681
00:36:54,141 --> 00:36:56,942
simply something that you do as an activity with your team

682
00:36:56,942 --> 00:36:58,403
members, your leads.

683
00:36:58,403 --> 00:37:01,284
You have to be constantly identifying things.

684
00:37:01,865 --> 00:37:05,025
Those that need to continue, those that need to stop,

685
00:37:05,025 --> 00:37:06,946
new things that you should start doing,

686
00:37:06,946 --> 00:37:08,366
things that need to be discussed.

687
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:11,387
Okay, you are gonna come across things that have to stop.

688
00:37:11,387 --> 00:37:16,108
And the only way to break a cycle in a bad culture

689
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:19,448
or to avoid some pitfall for quality of project,

690
00:37:19,448 --> 00:37:22,309
things that make studios go out of business,

691
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:25,510
is to make bad stuff stop as quickly as possible.

692
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:27,870
And it is your responsibility to do that.

693
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:33,738
The best producers walk around.

694
00:37:33,738 --> 00:37:35,939
I talked about not sending all your messages

695
00:37:35,939 --> 00:37:37,539
through electronic means.

696
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:40,500
If you have a team, if it's not just a fully distributed team,

697
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,081
I'm saying in the realm of the feasible,

698
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:44,121
you should be walking around.

699
00:37:44,121 --> 00:37:45,982
Your face should be everywhere.

700
00:37:45,982 --> 00:37:47,502
People should know who you are.

701
00:37:47,502 --> 00:37:49,123
You should know who your dev team members are.

702
00:37:49,123 --> 00:37:51,904
You should know as much as you possibly can about them.

703
00:37:51,904 --> 00:37:55,585
And there are some really tangible reasons for that

704
00:37:55,585 --> 00:37:59,427
and some popular thinking about the walking manager.

705
00:38:01,218 --> 00:38:07,240
One of those is the ability to send that message and rally people around your causes.

706
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:14,361
You have to be able to use words and convey your words in a way about what your goals are

707
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:20,543
that gets your team members excited and impelled to do what's needed for your project.

708
00:38:20,543 --> 00:38:25,164
So you have to be the person. You might think it's corny or you didn't come from a background

709
00:38:25,164 --> 00:38:26,745
where this is a thing that you did or you're...

710
00:38:27,245 --> 00:38:30,606
introverted or whatever, you have to practice helping rally people.

711
00:38:30,606 --> 00:38:35,808
Maybe you're not the right one to actually be the rally point and do the hoo-ah moment.

712
00:38:35,808 --> 00:38:37,068
That's fine.

713
00:38:37,068 --> 00:38:37,848
That's fine.

714
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:45,431
But you need to be part of the solution to get people excited and using their passions.

715
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:51,253
The best producers show and practice.

716
00:38:51,847 --> 00:38:56,471
The things they want in the macro, they do it in the micro

717
00:38:56,471 --> 00:39:01,215
all the time, every day, in the smallest ways, because it

718
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:04,778
sends a vibe across your entire team and your studio

719
00:39:04,778 --> 00:39:09,022
about what your expectations are from the smallest to the

720
00:39:09,022 --> 00:39:11,865
largest, it's common themes.

721
00:39:11,865 --> 00:39:16,489
So here are some in that, basically according to that

722
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:16,869
triangle.

723
00:39:17,868 --> 00:39:20,210
The team's food, again, details.

724
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:25,036
Clearly communicating every time you branch or have a build.

725
00:39:25,036 --> 00:39:27,439
Don't let those get by you.

726
00:39:27,439 --> 00:39:30,582
People need to be aware of the state of the product.

727
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:35,653
that loop from intent to QA, depending on how you manage

728
00:39:35,653 --> 00:39:39,717
QA and quality in your studio, this could be a huge thing.

729
00:39:39,717 --> 00:39:42,920
Not just because you want to reduce bugs and defects, but

730
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:48,165
because your QA team typically is your front line of getting

731
00:39:48,165 --> 00:39:52,950
a broad view of the quality of the state of the next piece of

732
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,852
software that you're releasing.

733
00:39:57,385 --> 00:39:59,526
So this cadence of useful communication, the best

734
00:39:59,526 --> 00:40:01,807
producers maintain that cadence and are

735
00:40:01,807 --> 00:40:02,907
intentional about it.

736
00:40:02,907 --> 00:40:05,588
You don't just, when you have information, send it.

737
00:40:05,588 --> 00:40:09,630
You think about regularly what is the kind of digest?

738
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:13,072
What are the kinds of information that you can

739
00:40:13,072 --> 00:40:16,553
provide on a regular basis so that you set an expectation

740
00:40:16,553 --> 00:40:18,494
with your team that you are going to

741
00:40:18,494 --> 00:40:19,555
provide them information?

742
00:40:20,075 --> 00:40:22,196
Even if you don't have a lot to say,

743
00:40:22,196 --> 00:40:24,137
provide a little bit on a regular basis

744
00:40:24,137 --> 00:40:25,958
so they know that information's happening

745
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:26,879
and they'll feel a lot more secure

746
00:40:26,879 --> 00:40:27,939
about decisions being made

747
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:28,559
that they're not aware of.

748
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,501
The best producers have a strong moral compass.

749
00:40:30,501 --> 00:40:31,781
I don't think I need to say a lot about that.

750
00:40:43,116 --> 00:40:47,138
But maybe it's not obvious to people coming in the industry.

751
00:40:47,138 --> 00:40:48,978
It was interesting to me, this came up a lot

752
00:40:48,978 --> 00:40:51,659
when I was talking with my production friends

753
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:53,680
about what makes for great producers,

754
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,821
is that your team can rely on you

755
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:58,662
to make decisions for the right reasons.

756
00:40:58,662 --> 00:41:02,864
And that your team can recover even

757
00:41:02,864 --> 00:41:06,805
if consequences of decisions are negative.

758
00:41:06,805 --> 00:41:10,567
You have to practice what you want.

759
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:15,192
You have to have a shipping mentality all the time.

760
00:41:15,192 --> 00:41:18,014
And now, again, the industry is really big now.

761
00:41:18,014 --> 00:41:22,617
So we have people in many areas of development where maybe you

762
00:41:22,617 --> 00:41:24,839
don't ship things in the same way that I do,

763
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:25,819
cross-platform and PC.

764
00:41:25,819 --> 00:41:28,921
Maybe you're, hell, maybe you're shipping every day if

765
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:30,443
you're in mobile.

766
00:41:30,943 --> 00:41:33,224
So there you definitely have to keep that shipping mentality.

767
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:34,765
But you also might be doing things

768
00:41:34,765 --> 00:41:39,047
where efficacy is much higher than,

769
00:41:39,047 --> 00:41:41,308
or you might think efficacy for, say,

770
00:41:41,308 --> 00:41:43,509
if you're doing an educational game or something,

771
00:41:43,509 --> 00:41:45,350
is higher than pure entertainment value.

772
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:48,111
And so your mentality is more around efficacy.

773
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:50,292
That's fine, but we're making games still.

774
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:51,333
So we want to make fun things that

775
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:52,353
are going to get out there.

776
00:41:52,353 --> 00:41:53,494
When you don't include the team.

777
00:41:58,561 --> 00:42:00,243
in decisions about the thing they're making,

778
00:42:00,243 --> 00:42:04,047
then they're not bought in, and then they're out.

779
00:42:04,047 --> 00:42:06,850
A lot of people see it as binary.

780
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:08,832
A lot of developers, they're passionate,

781
00:42:08,832 --> 00:42:10,674
and they're going to see it as a binary decision.

782
00:42:10,674 --> 00:42:12,255
They're either in or they're out.

783
00:42:12,255 --> 00:42:13,016
You've got to keep them in.

784
00:42:13,016 --> 00:42:15,018
And the way you keep them in is by keeping them engaged.

785
00:42:17,508 --> 00:42:19,209
Best producers are playing games.

786
00:42:19,209 --> 00:42:21,050
Hopefully you're playing games with your teams.

787
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,311
It's a great team building exercise if you're playing

788
00:42:24,311 --> 00:42:25,651
cooperative games.

789
00:42:25,651 --> 00:42:28,112
Competitive's cool too, but if you're playing co-op games

790
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:31,393
with hard missions, then those are great team building

791
00:42:31,393 --> 00:42:33,414
moments, also shows you're a gamer, you're buying those

792
00:42:33,414 --> 00:42:34,194
cred points.

793
00:42:34,194 --> 00:42:36,495
So producer, a lot of people who are not in production.

794
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:46,793
A lot of us who are in production think of the producer as a scheduler.

795
00:42:46,793 --> 00:42:48,494
I think of the scheduler as the project manager.

796
00:42:48,494 --> 00:42:52,736
I think of project management as part of what producers do.

797
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:57,039
We've created titles for people who spend more time in scheduling than in other areas

798
00:42:57,039 --> 00:42:58,040
of production.

799
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:03,723
But if you want to be a great producer, you better be awesome at scheduling.

800
00:43:03,723 --> 00:43:09,327
You can go other directions in production that aren't as scheduling focused.

801
00:43:11,013 --> 00:43:14,376
When somebody in finance, say, asks you,

802
00:43:14,376 --> 00:43:16,358
are you going to hit this milestone?

803
00:43:16,358 --> 00:43:21,542
And you, I wouldn't say lie, but you make a reach statement

804
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:23,244
and say yes without actually knowing

805
00:43:23,244 --> 00:43:25,926
what the state of the project as compared to your schedule is,

806
00:43:25,926 --> 00:43:29,550
then you're putting yourself in a dangerous situation.

807
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:37,072
What I prefer is people to come from a background of having to work with creative departments

808
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:43,553
and building lists, going very deep into those lists, maintaining data to do trend analysis

809
00:43:43,553 --> 00:43:49,435
with what the outcome of the work from those lists was over time, so that you really quickly

810
00:43:49,435 --> 00:43:57,116
build your – well, quickly – so that you build your bullshit filter and have the encompassing

811
00:43:58,693 --> 00:44:01,676
how quickly people can get things done on your team,

812
00:44:01,676 --> 00:44:06,039
what the kinds of appropriate work is for your team to commit to, etc.

813
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:09,542
The hard thing there, I think,

814
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:11,984
because I still don't see it often enough

815
00:44:11,984 --> 00:44:16,608
with even just people who are only focused on scheduling and project management,

816
00:44:16,608 --> 00:44:17,549
is in bracketing.

817
00:44:17,549 --> 00:44:24,015
If you have any responsibility for scheduling at all,

818
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,928
And even if you don't, and you just

819
00:44:27,928 --> 00:44:30,035
want to make sure you know what the hell's going on

820
00:44:30,035 --> 00:44:30,677
in your project.

821
00:44:31,945 --> 00:44:38,289
I hope that you can regularly have conversations about and build your own backwards plans and

822
00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:39,450
forwards plans.

823
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:45,394
Compare the two and then bracket the window of when you think things are going to land.

824
00:44:45,394 --> 00:44:50,537
Use that as part of doing your backlog building if you're doing Agile.

825
00:44:50,537 --> 00:44:56,401
Use it as part of your milestone commitments or even your initial full project schedules.

826
00:44:57,318 --> 00:45:02,463
The more you do that over the time, the better you're actually going to get at knowing how

827
00:45:02,463 --> 00:45:06,267
much scope you should be committing to with the kinds of people you have, as opposed to

828
00:45:06,267 --> 00:45:09,870
guessing or just guessing.

829
00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:11,572
And ask a lot of questions for those things.

830
00:45:18,223 --> 00:45:21,304
Going back to, say, music, that's definitely talent

831
00:45:21,304 --> 00:45:25,366
management, A&R, artisan repertoire, kind of like

832
00:45:25,366 --> 00:45:29,068
building bands or groups or working with them to make sure

833
00:45:29,068 --> 00:45:30,768
that they're being promoted or doing the best

834
00:45:30,768 --> 00:45:31,629
kind of work they can.

835
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:33,450
It's the same thing in games.

836
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:38,071
It is a talent management business, and hopefully you know that.

837
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:43,853
It's not just getting random people in and building a schedule around them, but rather

838
00:45:43,853 --> 00:45:49,815
over time, especially in a studio environment, really crafting what the team is like and

839
00:45:49,815 --> 00:45:53,316
who's responsible for what things, so your composition is good.

840
00:45:53,316 --> 00:45:58,438
Senior people tend to want to mentor others, or at least rely on the experience they have

841
00:45:58,438 --> 00:45:59,958
and know that it's being listened to.

842
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:02,339
So you want to have the right mix of senior and junior people.

843
00:46:05,455 --> 00:46:09,638
You only go to war with the army that you have, right?

844
00:46:09,638 --> 00:46:11,099
So make sure on behalf of your team

845
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:12,960
that you're committing to the things that they can do.

846
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,503
You need to know what their growth plans are also,

847
00:46:16,503 --> 00:46:18,024
so you know what kinds of challenges

848
00:46:18,024 --> 00:46:18,904
they want to accomplish next.

849
00:46:18,904 --> 00:46:22,647
You have to constantly be talking

850
00:46:22,647 --> 00:46:27,110
about what the goals were and whether or not

851
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:29,912
you hit them and celebrating those successes when

852
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,334
they happen, but always providing, kind of bread

853
00:46:32,334 --> 00:46:33,875
crumbing the goals for your teams.

854
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:38,131
If you don't know what the growth plans are for your team

855
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:40,633
members, please go find out or build them

856
00:46:40,633 --> 00:46:42,454
if you haven't already.

857
00:46:42,454 --> 00:46:45,956
You have to get inside the heads of your team members

858
00:46:45,956 --> 00:46:47,857
so that you know what's possible,

859
00:46:47,857 --> 00:46:49,798
not just what you've already committed to,

860
00:46:49,798 --> 00:46:52,240
but what's possible with the team that you have

861
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,081
and where your gaps might be for what's next.

862
00:46:55,081 --> 00:46:56,222
So I think all of us are only going

863
00:46:56,222 --> 00:47:00,265
to stay in this industry if we're able to innovate,

864
00:47:00,265 --> 00:47:01,665
if we're able to

865
00:47:02,787 --> 00:47:06,776
capitalize on the teams that we've built or are going to build in the future.

866
00:47:06,776 --> 00:47:09,964
We can't do that if we don't go deeper into knowing the motivations of our people.

867
00:47:15,001 --> 00:47:16,942
Your decision-making framework's really important.

868
00:47:16,942 --> 00:47:19,442
It's also very important that you be able to communicate it.

869
00:47:19,442 --> 00:47:22,884
And that's really hard for many producers

870
00:47:22,884 --> 00:47:25,284
to communicate that they even have a decision-making

871
00:47:25,284 --> 00:47:25,584
framework.

872
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:28,706
It's easy to say you're making decisions based on common sense.

873
00:47:28,706 --> 00:47:31,506
It's really hard to say you're making decisions

874
00:47:31,506 --> 00:47:34,107
based on any particular framework or approach.

875
00:47:34,107 --> 00:47:37,568
I mention a few things here, and I'm

876
00:47:37,568 --> 00:47:39,509
going to ask if you're not familiar with these,

877
00:47:39,509 --> 00:47:44,891
that you follow up and discover more about them.

878
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:48,834
One I didn't write in here, which has to do with P&L impact,

879
00:47:48,834 --> 00:47:53,940
is the idea of earned value management.

880
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,442
In earned value management, you're

881
00:47:55,442 --> 00:47:56,763
comparing the product that you built

882
00:47:56,763 --> 00:47:57,845
to the money that you spent.

883
00:47:59,062 --> 00:48:02,684
And to people in finance, the ones who tend to control this,

884
00:48:02,684 --> 00:48:04,966
you're just completely self-financed, in which case

885
00:48:04,966 --> 00:48:06,367
congratulations to you.

886
00:48:06,367 --> 00:48:10,149
But for those of us who are still working with other

887
00:48:10,149 --> 00:48:12,651
people's money, the more clearly that you can

888
00:48:12,651 --> 00:48:15,073
communicate the value of the thing that was built to the

889
00:48:15,073 --> 00:48:18,815
money that was spent, the less other questions you're going

890
00:48:18,815 --> 00:48:23,619
to need to answer, and the more leverage you'll have to

891
00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:25,500
get new things that you need for your team.

892
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,682
Kinevan framework.

893
00:48:29,225 --> 00:48:32,527
This relates directly to Agile, and this

894
00:48:32,527 --> 00:48:35,610
is around understanding the situation that you're in.

895
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:38,613
Situational awareness, and then having a measured response

896
00:48:38,613 --> 00:48:40,514
to the situation that you're in.

897
00:48:40,514 --> 00:48:43,557
To go from being a good producer to a great producer,

898
00:48:43,557 --> 00:48:45,598
this is something that you have to master,

899
00:48:45,598 --> 00:48:48,281
is modifying your approach to the situation

900
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:50,042
that you're in with your project and your team.

901
00:48:52,705 --> 00:48:55,928
And hand in hand with that practiced agility.

902
00:48:55,928 --> 00:49:00,453
So, you know, how many of you now are kind of in full

903
00:49:00,453 --> 00:49:03,516
or very heavily adopted agile production frameworks

904
00:49:03,516 --> 00:49:03,797
in your studio?

905
00:49:03,797 --> 00:49:07,441
Okay, not everyone, but many, most of you I'd say.

906
00:49:08,624 --> 00:49:15,011
I found, and you probably know, I haven't found a common implementation of Agile or

907
00:49:15,011 --> 00:49:19,596
Scrum or Kanban in any set of studio environments.

908
00:49:19,596 --> 00:49:23,841
Everybody's doing something a little different, which I think is cool and good because it

909
00:49:23,841 --> 00:49:25,743
should be something that matches with your culture.

910
00:49:27,084 --> 00:49:34,548
But because it's different in many different studio environments, we need to practice before

911
00:49:34,548 --> 00:49:40,172
we implement full scale, and practicing can be very hard because you have to find the

912
00:49:40,172 --> 00:49:41,552
right situations to do it in.

913
00:49:41,552 --> 00:49:46,996
And sometimes things don't work and we have to break them and do something different,

914
00:49:46,996 --> 00:49:49,117
and that can be hard when you've fully committed to some...

915
00:49:49,917 --> 00:49:55,420
production methodology and you may not feel empowered now or it might feel like momentum

916
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,941
is working against you to change what you've done.

917
00:49:57,941 --> 00:50:03,143
So one of the ways to do that is to have some kind of incubation little project where you

918
00:50:03,143 --> 00:50:07,204
can practice something different and use that as a comparison point.

919
00:50:07,204 --> 00:50:09,345
We actually do that fairly often at Gearbox.

920
00:50:10,808 --> 00:50:13,911
SWOT analysis, you probably know what SWOT analysis is,

921
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:16,473
but being able to identify your strengths, weaknesses,

922
00:50:16,473 --> 00:50:17,914
opportunities, and threats.

923
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:21,297
But being able to then use that as a way to explain

924
00:50:21,297 --> 00:50:23,439
to other, say, executive stakeholders,

925
00:50:23,439 --> 00:50:26,181
or even people on the team, what kinds of things

926
00:50:26,181 --> 00:50:27,703
you should pursue in your projects,

927
00:50:27,703 --> 00:50:30,045
or people you should hire, especially if you're doing

928
00:50:30,045 --> 00:50:32,387
gap analysis for your teams, to be able to use that

929
00:50:32,387 --> 00:50:34,709
as a way to describe how you came to those answers

930
00:50:34,709 --> 00:50:35,390
can be very helpful.

931
00:50:40,241 --> 00:50:46,304
So innovation, I'm going to talk a little bit again about as a senior producer, or to

932
00:50:46,304 --> 00:50:53,808
be a super producer in the industry, you need to be able to lead people into innovation.

933
00:50:53,808 --> 00:50:59,591
You can't just be standing behind waiting for others as they're making decisions to

934
00:50:59,591 --> 00:51:03,854
try to pick up the pieces from them to see how you can support the efforts that they

935
00:51:03,854 --> 00:51:04,254
want.

936
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:11,174
Whether that's in some new network infrastructure that the team wants to build, going more data-driven

937
00:51:11,174 --> 00:51:17,879
in your design, whatever it is, you need to be at this point, to be at this level of production,

938
00:51:17,879 --> 00:51:24,263
part of that decision-making process, and funneling it, funneling the decision by asking

939
00:51:24,263 --> 00:51:27,226
questions about feasibility and being part of that process.

940
00:51:27,226 --> 00:51:31,729
That's how you move from chaos to structure.

941
00:51:32,858 --> 00:51:34,942
This is what that framework, by the way, high level looks like.

942
00:51:34,942 --> 00:51:37,447
Go out and read more about it.

943
00:51:37,447 --> 00:51:39,290
And when you give your presentation,

944
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:40,432
you'll know plenty there.

945
00:51:41,814 --> 00:51:50,659
I like to, on occasion when I'm talking about production philosophy, explain that a lot

946
00:51:50,659 --> 00:51:57,062
of the decisions I make come from things that I've studied in the past having to do with

947
00:51:57,062 --> 00:51:59,144
strategy and battle strategy.

948
00:51:59,144 --> 00:52:02,545
And this is one of my favorites, Miyamoto Musashi.

949
00:52:02,545 --> 00:52:04,707
Do any of you know who Miyamoto Musashi was?

950
00:52:04,707 --> 00:52:06,387
Quite a few of you.

951
00:52:06,387 --> 00:52:06,668
Cool.

952
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:08,569
He's the author of the Book of Five Rings.

953
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:16,264
This first point here from the quote, anyway, from the Earth

954
00:52:16,264 --> 00:52:17,585
book, don't engage in useless activity.

955
00:52:17,585 --> 00:52:19,766
So it's basically don't do anything that's of no use.

956
00:52:19,766 --> 00:52:22,868
And when your team sees that you're not engaging in

957
00:52:22,868 --> 00:52:26,090
useless activities, and when you're focusing your effort

958
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:28,491
only in those things that are always pushing your team

959
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:32,373
forward, and while in pulling your team forward.

960
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:36,920
Again, you're gaining a lot of credibility points, but also you're being efficient and

961
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:44,043
saving money and helping to create a culture of self-reliance amongst your team members.

962
00:52:44,043 --> 00:52:46,765
I recommend that you read the book.

963
00:52:50,324 --> 00:52:55,708
As a leader, as a super producer in the industry,

964
00:52:55,708 --> 00:52:59,251
you have to quickly be able to explain to others

965
00:52:59,251 --> 00:53:01,432
what your definition of leadership is.

966
00:53:01,432 --> 00:53:03,594
This is something that a colleague of mine,

967
00:53:03,594 --> 00:53:07,377
John Antal, the colonel, at our studio,

968
00:53:07,377 --> 00:53:12,521
he's a great leader and he's a great teacher of leadership.

969
00:53:12,521 --> 00:53:15,743
And he makes sure that people always can define

970
00:53:15,743 --> 00:53:18,085
what leadership means to them quickly.

971
00:53:18,085 --> 00:53:20,087
You have to have kind of your elevator pitch of it.

972
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:24,332
And if you want to be great, you have to know what it is for you.

973
00:53:24,332 --> 00:53:29,294
Not just that there's some notion of leadership out there, but what it really means.

974
00:53:29,294 --> 00:53:36,556
For me, it really just comes down to the ability to impel versus compel, and how that translates

975
00:53:36,556 --> 00:53:38,877
into what I do with my teams.

976
00:53:38,877 --> 00:53:48,981
So first, for leadership mastery, you have to be a great representative of your team

977
00:53:48,981 --> 00:53:49,741
and your organization.

978
00:53:51,656 --> 00:54:00,961
To be a truly excellent producer, everyone you work with has to know that when you are

979
00:54:00,961 --> 00:54:06,725
talking with them, that you are really truly representing that organization, what it means

980
00:54:06,725 --> 00:54:08,286
well.

981
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:12,188
And that you are a key person in that organization.

982
00:54:12,188 --> 00:54:14,990
So don't do the things that would hurt that.

983
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:18,933
And better yet, do the things that others would kind of seek to be.

984
00:54:18,933 --> 00:54:20,353
You do that yourself.

985
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:27,203
Second, you can't lead from the back.

986
00:54:27,203 --> 00:54:29,705
I mean, there are theories of management,

987
00:54:29,705 --> 00:54:31,607
some of which I think are basically

988
00:54:31,607 --> 00:54:36,632
just passive aggressive theories around covering your ass,

989
00:54:36,632 --> 00:54:39,695
which would be leading from the back.

990
00:54:39,695 --> 00:54:41,757
But if you really want to be a great producer

991
00:54:41,757 --> 00:54:43,799
and be able to build awesome,

992
00:54:44,689 --> 00:54:48,895
teams that do amazing things, you have to be with them there at the front.

993
00:54:48,895 --> 00:54:53,681
You have to be identified as somebody who's leading from the front with those teams.

994
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:55,023
You have to be a driver with them.

995
00:54:55,023 --> 00:54:57,246
Succession planning.

996
00:54:57,246 --> 00:54:58,708
You know, this is a really hard one.

997
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,720
for companies, not just as a producer and a team.

998
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,501
This is a really hard one for companies to think about.

999
00:55:06,501 --> 00:55:08,141
You know, a lot of studios have been built

1000
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:09,522
as lifestyle businesses, right?

1001
00:55:09,522 --> 00:55:13,263
They haven't been built as some other kind of company

1002
00:55:13,263 --> 00:55:14,803
that's going to scale and grow

1003
00:55:14,803 --> 00:55:16,263
and transform into other things.

1004
00:55:16,263 --> 00:55:18,364
We have a lot of studios that have people

1005
00:55:18,364 --> 00:55:20,304
who are making games because they wanted to make games

1006
00:55:20,304 --> 00:55:20,985
and they're in that.

1007
00:55:21,605 --> 00:55:25,766
company to make games and they're not going to do something else.

1008
00:55:25,766 --> 00:55:31,867
So that studio, and is represented now in the team that you work with,

1009
00:55:31,867 --> 00:55:34,608
are there just to be there to make games. And that's awesome.

1010
00:55:34,608 --> 00:55:38,429
I want to make great games. I hope you all want to make great games.

1011
00:55:38,429 --> 00:55:40,970
But people are not going to just be in one role forever.

1012
00:55:42,112 --> 00:55:46,934
And even if you can't get buy-in from the people you work for,

1013
00:55:46,934 --> 00:55:50,455
you yourself, to be great, need to be actively engaged

1014
00:55:50,455 --> 00:55:52,156
in succession planning all the time.

1015
00:55:52,156 --> 00:55:56,978
You need to imagine, what if you're hit by the bus?

1016
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:59,279
What if your team members are hit by the bus?

1017
00:55:59,279 --> 00:56:04,361
What if you need to move people into new roles of leadership?

1018
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,302
What do you do with the vacuum behind them?

1019
00:56:06,302 --> 00:56:08,743
How do you get them to do that as well?

1020
00:56:12,807 --> 00:56:16,289
You want to be awesome, you better be able to speak truth to power.

1021
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:20,352
And that can be very scary. If you're afraid for your job,

1022
00:56:20,352 --> 00:56:24,815
you may not be able to do this. Maybe you'll be brave enough to do it, maybe you won't.

1023
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:29,258
I hope you will be. I personally am not interested

1024
00:56:29,258 --> 00:56:34,661
in having producers who work at Gearbox under me,

1025
00:56:34,661 --> 00:56:39,244
who I'm not interested in having them be there if they are afraid to speak their mind to me.

1026
00:56:39,244 --> 00:56:40,825
So I try to create.

1027
00:56:41,646 --> 00:56:47,610
I believe I create safe environments for anyone to voice any concern that they have, and I

1028
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:53,615
hope that you are doing that also and not penalizing people for having opinions.

1029
00:56:53,615 --> 00:56:57,657
Remember you have to have that baseline of being calm, and once you've done that, then

1030
00:56:57,657 --> 00:56:59,399
you have the credibility to coach them in some direction.

1031
00:56:59,399 --> 00:57:00,419
Remember I want you all to go home and teach.

1032
00:57:07,068 --> 00:57:10,651
what we're talking about here today, but do it in your own words, with your own examples,

1033
00:57:10,651 --> 00:57:13,114
in your own pictures, in whatever you want to use.

1034
00:57:13,114 --> 00:57:19,120
But if you want to become great and you want to be seen as someone who has a credibility

1035
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:25,105
to be overseeing a lot of projects and people, you also have to see yourself as a teacher,

1036
00:57:25,105 --> 00:57:31,952
not just somebody who's a satellite pulling and conveying information.

1037
00:57:37,216 --> 00:57:45,064
These last couple are where I think you really transform.

1038
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,669
Once you've done all those other things,

1039
00:57:47,669 --> 00:57:50,050
once you've stopped doing the bad things

1040
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:53,251
and you've turned those into ways to be very positive

1041
00:57:53,251 --> 00:57:57,292
and to do great things, the way that you conduct yourself

1042
00:57:57,292 --> 00:57:59,132
and the way that you work with your teams,

1043
00:57:59,132 --> 00:58:03,473
when you think about the sphere of influence that you have

1044
00:58:03,473 --> 00:58:06,954
and how you can expand that for the benefit of your team

1045
00:58:06,954 --> 00:58:09,274
and the quality of the projects that you work on,

1046
00:58:09,274 --> 00:58:13,635
that gets you to start thinking about things

1047
00:58:13,635 --> 00:58:14,696
on kind of a new plane.

1048
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:20,143
because right now maybe you're just focused,

1049
00:58:20,143 --> 00:58:21,924
and when I say just, I really don't mean

1050
00:58:21,924 --> 00:58:23,606
this disparagingly, okay?

1051
00:58:23,606 --> 00:58:26,128
You might be focused on the project that you're working on

1052
00:58:26,128 --> 00:58:27,989
and the team members that you have

1053
00:58:27,989 --> 00:58:30,031
and just how to do the best you can,

1054
00:58:30,031 --> 00:58:31,952
you know, going to war with the army you have, right?

1055
00:58:31,952 --> 00:58:33,834
How to do the best you can in that scenario.

1056
00:58:33,834 --> 00:58:39,278
But when you can expand your reach and your influence

1057
00:58:39,278 --> 00:58:41,620
way beyond the boundaries of that team

1058
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,221
and the company and the project that you're in,

1059
00:58:43,842 --> 00:58:49,766
you're going to find all kinds of new opportunities for whatever, recruiting, for where your project

1060
00:58:49,766 --> 00:58:58,852
can go from there, new opportunities for building that in the IP with, you know, ancillary opportunities,

1061
00:58:58,852 --> 00:59:04,556
licensing opportunities, meeting people, you know, the effective networking and how that

1062
00:59:04,556 --> 00:59:06,177
can benefit you and your team.

1063
00:59:07,197 --> 00:59:11,739
So, when you think about the sphere of influence you have

1064
00:59:11,739 --> 00:59:14,840
and what it would mean to grow that in a way that benefits the team,

1065
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,961
not just you, yourself, you're going to move into

1066
00:59:17,961 --> 00:59:20,642
this whole other level of super producer.

1067
00:59:20,642 --> 00:59:27,445
And then, to go even a step beyond that,

1068
00:59:27,445 --> 00:59:30,226
to me this is kind of the ultimate.

1069
00:59:30,226 --> 00:59:32,307
When you can get to that point

1070
00:59:32,307 --> 00:59:35,148
and then be able to expand your teammates

1071
00:59:35,789 --> 00:59:42,073
spheres of influence. Now you're scaling your organization and your entire organization's

1072
00:59:42,073 --> 00:59:48,897
capability and being the connector for your teammates to others out there in the world

1073
00:59:48,897 --> 00:59:57,402
to be on technical steering committees or to give talks at, you know, GDC here or at

1074
00:59:57,402 --> 01:00:00,624
the other regional GDCs or DICE.

1075
01:00:02,205 --> 01:00:05,547
To be able to expand your reach out and to learn new things,

1076
01:00:05,547 --> 01:00:07,468
people will come to you at that point

1077
01:00:07,468 --> 01:00:11,951
or through your team members who you are asking

1078
01:00:11,951 --> 01:00:14,232
to expand their own spheres of influence.

1079
01:00:14,232 --> 01:00:17,354
You're going to learn a lot about what's happening

1080
01:00:17,354 --> 01:00:19,616
in the world for your organization.

1081
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,876
So in kind of the corporate world, right,

1082
01:00:20,876 --> 01:00:24,219
there's this idea of business intelligence

1083
01:00:24,219 --> 01:00:27,180
and competitive intelligence and analysis.

1084
01:00:29,222 --> 01:00:32,384
Really, I think for us in the games industry,

1085
01:00:32,384 --> 01:00:34,786
as we do need to keep innovating and learning

1086
01:00:34,786 --> 01:00:37,568
about what all the opportunities are for us to innovate

1087
01:00:37,568 --> 01:00:39,850
and where we can make money now and in the future,

1088
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:45,454
one of the best things that you can leverage to accomplish that,

1089
01:00:45,454 --> 01:00:47,816
to have that learning to be able to actually execute on it,

1090
01:00:47,816 --> 01:00:49,977
is to work through your team members to do it.

1091
01:00:52,831 --> 01:00:55,835
At origin, back in those days, EA didn't really

1092
01:00:55,835 --> 01:00:57,238
want people to come to GDC.

1093
01:00:57,238 --> 01:00:59,040
Now, I don't know if that's still true.

1094
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,522
I think EA is a very different company now,

1095
01:01:00,522 --> 01:01:01,604
and I think they're great and whatever.

1096
01:01:03,094 --> 01:01:05,155
But it's a different world now.

1097
01:01:05,155 --> 01:01:09,797
And I hope that attitude isn't prevalent anymore.

1098
01:01:09,797 --> 01:01:13,358
I hope there is no fear of our team members coming to

1099
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:18,860
something like a GDC, or a Dice, or any other conference

1100
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:21,601
where they can have great takeaways and bring them back

1101
01:01:21,601 --> 01:01:22,101
to the team.

1102
01:01:22,101 --> 01:01:24,242
Because it's the only way that I think we're going to stay

1103
01:01:24,242 --> 01:01:26,803
competitive, all of us, with what we're doing.

1104
01:01:28,356 --> 01:01:31,357
And this is kind of the key, I think,

1105
01:01:31,357 --> 01:01:35,119
to being able to keep making games.

1106
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,041
So that's it.
