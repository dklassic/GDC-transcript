1
00:00:03,143 --> 00:00:03,405
You

2
00:00:11,165 --> 00:00:13,127
All right, my name's Mike Bridgman.

3
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:17,050
I'm here to talk about how not to build a VR arcade game.

4
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,474
And the title of my talk is partly inspired

5
00:00:20,534 --> 00:00:23,737
by Thomas Edison famously saying he invented 99 ways

6
00:00:24,277 --> 00:00:26,840
how not to make a light bulb before he invented

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,101
the best way to make a light bulb.

8
00:00:28,802 --> 00:00:31,284
So I'm gonna talk today a lot about the lessons we learned

9
00:00:31,684 --> 00:00:32,805
through a lot of trial and error.

10
00:00:34,527 --> 00:00:35,148
So let's get started.

11
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:37,564
Who is MajorMega?

12
00:00:37,924 --> 00:00:42,727
That is a company I co-founded in 2013 with Sean Hennessey.

13
00:00:43,568 --> 00:00:45,869
This is our first official company photo.

14
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:51,974
My mother questioned my professionalism when she saw this,

15
00:00:52,154 --> 00:00:55,496
but I had to explain that if somebody doesn't wanna work

16
00:00:55,516 --> 00:00:56,657
with us after seeing this photo,

17
00:00:56,677 --> 00:00:58,218
well then I sure as hell don't wanna work with them.

18
00:00:58,398 --> 00:01:01,000
So, it's kind of a qualifier.

19
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:01,961
It works really well.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,781
Our current mission is to create the arcade machines of the future.

21
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:12,905
And so the arcade machine of the future has a tall task because with Oculus Quest and

22
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:16,147
Home there are some incredibly immersive experiences you can have at home.

23
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:22,251
So you've got to do something much more grand than you could ever experience at home along

24
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:23,011
with other people.

25
00:01:24,053 --> 00:01:25,835
So the HyperDeck is our flagship product.

26
00:01:26,615 --> 00:01:30,699
It's got a full motion floor, very intense wind, heat,

27
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,183
turret controllers, and then our current offering,

28
00:01:35,383 --> 00:01:38,126
or our latest offering, is the SpongeBob SquarePants

29
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:40,067
VR dynamic duo game.

30
00:01:41,108 --> 00:01:43,791
So, let's go back in time.

31
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,371
I think this was around 2016 or 2017

32
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:50,754
on a project with Nat Geo about landing on Mars.

33
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:54,016
And from this era, we're gonna learn

34
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:56,558
that G-forces can be simulated,

35
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:59,900
motion can be amplified,

36
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,842
and fast iteration is key.

37
00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:05,263
I don't think I have a slide for this,

38
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:06,544
so I'm just gonna say right now,

39
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:08,985
as much as I'd like to pretend I could tell you

40
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:10,806
all the steps to eliminate motion sickness

41
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:12,087
and make the perfect experience.

42
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,153
it really just comes down to trying something,

43
00:02:15,793 --> 00:02:17,714
tweaking, trying it again, tweaking.

44
00:02:18,475 --> 00:02:19,755
It's a lot of just trial and error.

45
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:22,417
We're working on some tools that help with that,

46
00:02:22,497 --> 00:02:24,278
but I'll talk about that next year maybe.

47
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,580
So this project was a six degrees of freedom cable coaster.

48
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:31,101
And by six degrees of freedom,

49
00:02:31,121 --> 00:02:33,863
that basically means it can move in all directions.

50
00:02:33,943 --> 00:02:35,584
So those cables lift you off the ground,

51
00:02:35,604 --> 00:02:37,745
they can go up, down, left, right, forward, back,

52
00:02:37,785 --> 00:02:38,706
toss you all around.

53
00:02:40,427 --> 00:02:42,388
And this was set up for a week in Manhattan.

54
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:47,539
And it was a really fun experience because we really put a lot of our heart and soul

55
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:50,140
into it and then we got to spend a week just watching people enjoy it.

56
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:58,604
I don't have really great video of the more intense parts, but you can see here these

57
00:02:58,644 --> 00:03:02,686
guys are entering the atmosphere, they're just kind of getting jostled around.

58
00:03:04,026 --> 00:03:07,808
Then there's some more intense parts that get good reactions.

59
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:18,508
So, let's talk about this G-Force simulation.

60
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:24,270
During this project, if you put somebody in VR

61
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:27,011
on this thing and just let it be a one-to-one experience,

62
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:30,073
meaning the person is just letting the HMD do the work

63
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:31,713
and getting tossed around with the ride,

64
00:03:32,454 --> 00:03:34,094
a lot of people are getting motion sickness.

65
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,516
And what we discovered is it's because

66
00:03:37,536 --> 00:03:39,216
they weren't feeling the proper G-Forces

67
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:40,657
for what they were seeing visually.

68
00:03:41,775 --> 00:03:43,837
So like if you're sitting in one of these chairs

69
00:03:43,897 --> 00:03:45,118
in a virtual roller coaster,

70
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:47,300
chances are you'll get sick because your inner ear

71
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,121
is not getting the signals it thinks it needs

72
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:51,623
to feel like you're actually on that roller coaster.

73
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:54,346
So if you have two riders here,

74
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:57,248
just sitting there with a one-to-one VR experience,

75
00:03:57,308 --> 00:03:59,150
gravity's pulling straight down.

76
00:04:01,011 --> 00:04:02,172
But if we tilt you back,

77
00:04:03,093 --> 00:04:05,455
suddenly you're sliding back in your seat, right?

78
00:04:05,475 --> 00:04:07,016
You're getting pushed against the back of your seat.

79
00:04:08,766 --> 00:04:12,587
But if we take the VR image and we rotate your camera

80
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,588
in the game engine to counteract that rotation,

81
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:19,629
suddenly you have this middle ground

82
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:22,130
where the person in VR is not getting

83
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,151
the visual stimulus of being rotated,

84
00:04:24,691 --> 00:04:27,271
but they're actually feeling gravity pull

85
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,972
from a different direction than straight above.

86
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:32,493
While this is not a perfect g-force effect,

87
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,934
it is something like a real g-force effect

88
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:35,994
and it works really well.

89
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:39,130
It works well enough to prevent people from throwing up,

90
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,251
which is the most important thing

91
00:04:40,712 --> 00:04:42,614
in the out-of-home entertainment experience.

92
00:04:44,553 --> 00:04:46,534
So then the inverse of that is true, right?

93
00:04:46,594 --> 00:04:47,994
So you can amplify motion.

94
00:04:48,575 --> 00:04:51,355
So if we tilt you back, and then virtually,

95
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:53,276
we tilt your camera even more,

96
00:04:54,176 --> 00:04:56,237
we can create a sensation of you moving

97
00:04:56,717 --> 00:04:57,877
even more than you actually are.

98
00:04:58,117 --> 00:05:00,538
So the real benefit to this is that

99
00:05:01,358 --> 00:05:03,919
we can keep you in a safe motion profile,

100
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:06,219
but you actually think you're experiencing

101
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:07,440
something much more dangerous.

102
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:13,175
Oh, and I should say, a rough number we use is 400%

103
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:16,097
or four times the amount the person's actually moving.

104
00:05:16,938 --> 00:05:18,179
Again, it's just trial and error,

105
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:20,180
but I just think that number's important

106
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,983
because it's really amazing what the brain makes up

107
00:05:25,204 --> 00:05:26,425
when they see something visually

108
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:28,447
and feel enough of it to go the extra mile

109
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:30,028
and be like, nope, this is really happening to me.

110
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,812
So this was a huge multi-million dollar project.

111
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:37,754
It was never something that could be put in an arcade,

112
00:05:37,974 --> 00:05:38,435
obviously.

113
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:41,012
And this is kind of what sparked our journey

114
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:42,433
to create the Arcade of the Future.

115
00:05:43,154 --> 00:05:46,416
So we wanted to step back and start from scratch

116
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,839
and figure out what is the simplest thing we can do

117
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,862
to create motion in VR without people getting sick.

118
00:05:53,862 --> 00:05:56,004
So we started out by doing motion

119
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:58,306
without motion in real life.

120
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:01,869
So the lessons learned from this era are that

121
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,371
if you're not gonna move the person in real life,

122
00:06:04,671 --> 00:06:07,473
well virtually, you can't accelerate or turn.

123
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,081
The more wind, the better.

124
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:14,281
And you can do vertical motion, but it requires vibration.

125
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:19,143
And true randomness really, really enhances

126
00:06:19,183 --> 00:06:20,983
the level of immersion, and I'll get to more of that

127
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:21,403
in a bit.

128
00:06:23,163 --> 00:06:25,744
So we built this thing that we called the HyperRoom,

129
00:06:26,664 --> 00:06:29,625
and it's a Home Depot-inspired prototype.

130
00:06:29,645 --> 00:06:34,006
You can see the steel bars there and some box fans.

131
00:06:35,226 --> 00:06:37,347
I'm gonna show you a quick clip of this experience.

132
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:45,295
So you can see the person's rising up out of the truck.

133
00:06:46,035 --> 00:06:49,678
Wind kicks in when they clear up to open air.

134
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,742
And then we just had a really simple mechanic

135
00:06:55,062 --> 00:06:56,943
of basically using a gravity gun

136
00:06:58,404 --> 00:07:01,086
to grab car parts and shoot them back at the cars.

137
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:18,134
So, because this person is never accelerating or decelerating, he came up out of the truck,

138
00:07:18,174 --> 00:07:23,657
was already going 55, it was a great experience and nobody really got sick.

139
00:07:25,338 --> 00:07:32,221
And so, for that vertical vibration, I'm assuming a lot of you are working in 5.1 or 7.1 surround

140
00:07:32,261 --> 00:07:38,145
sound in your games, and a really, really easy way to add accurate and realistic vibration

141
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,146
is through a low frequency transducer.

142
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:43,578
And the Kleenex brand name of that is the Butt Kicker.

143
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,639
Maybe you've heard of it.

144
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,120
They're popular in home theaters.

145
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,181
They shake your sofa.

146
00:07:48,142 --> 00:07:50,083
But basically a low frequency transducer

147
00:07:50,924 --> 00:07:52,646
is a speaker without a speaker cone.

148
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:56,669
So all you have to do, and in my company

149
00:07:56,689 --> 00:07:58,211
that all you have to do phrase is a trigger.

150
00:07:58,231 --> 00:08:00,012
That means it's not actually as simple as you're saying.

151
00:08:00,753 --> 00:08:04,096
But all you have to do is hook the subchannel

152
00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:05,557
up to this transducer.

153
00:08:06,145 --> 00:08:10,867
And then when you send an explosion or gunfire or an elevator sound or whatever you're doing,

154
00:08:11,847 --> 00:08:14,548
your floor will vibrate exactly how it sounds.

155
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:17,449
So it's a really easy way to recycle the assets you're already using.

156
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,630
And then I want to talk about random.

157
00:08:23,484 --> 00:08:26,506
You know, when we first did this experience,

158
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:27,687
we wanted to add road bumps.

159
00:08:27,827 --> 00:08:29,468
So you start out with just a very basic

160
00:08:29,528 --> 00:08:31,529
bum bum, bum bum, bum bum,

161
00:08:31,549 --> 00:08:32,730
just like you're driving down the highway.

162
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,451
But when the pattern is perfect,

163
00:08:36,412 --> 00:08:38,893
your brain kind of starts ignoring it, right?

164
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:41,395
It gets used to it, and you don't even realize it's there.

165
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:45,363
So then we started making, just using basically math.random,

166
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:47,664
the simplest way we could do it, and mixing it up a little.

167
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:49,826
But it still didn't feel very organic.

168
00:08:49,906 --> 00:08:52,808
And we found that using a Perlin noise function,

169
00:08:52,988 --> 00:08:54,068
maybe some of you have used it,

170
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:57,170
it's a 2D visualization on the right here.

171
00:08:58,151 --> 00:09:01,333
It's a really great way to get organic noise.

172
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:03,955
It's very popular in terrain generation

173
00:09:03,995 --> 00:09:04,795
and things like that.

174
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,617
So we found that using Perlin noise

175
00:09:07,757 --> 00:09:10,599
for environmental effects and haptic feelings,

176
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,847
It's a really great way to add that next level of immersion.

177
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,252
So, let's take it a step further

178
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:22,375
and add motion in real life with motion in VR.

179
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,237
So lessons learned from here are

180
00:09:25,738 --> 00:09:28,180
wind direction is not always important,

181
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,361
mostly it's not important.

182
00:09:32,623 --> 00:09:35,146
Motion and heat do require visual indicators

183
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:36,146
to be truly effective.

184
00:09:38,469 --> 00:09:40,089
And the fishbowl effect is real.

185
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,451
Players are self-conscious when you essentially

186
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,792
blindfold them in public with a VR headset.

187
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:49,976
And haptics require a 240 frames a second

188
00:09:49,996 --> 00:09:51,556
or greater resolution to be effective.

189
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:58,039
So, for our platform, we went with three degrees of freedom,

190
00:09:58,239 --> 00:10:00,200
which basically means you can roll left and right,

191
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,520
you can pitch forward and back,

192
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,880
and you can heave straight up and down.

193
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,661
And we tried all kinds of stuff with airbags and springs

194
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:07,761
and some other weird stuff,

195
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:10,962
but electric linear actuators are the sweet spot

196
00:10:11,262 --> 00:10:16,723
of price, low maintenance, they're very affordable,

197
00:10:17,443 --> 00:10:21,324
and you can see here, they're a pretty compact package.

198
00:10:23,147 --> 00:10:26,811
So then we built a safety deck around the motion platform,

199
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:30,775
and we ended up creating what I call the VR Speakeasy.

200
00:10:31,836 --> 00:10:35,840
This was set up in the storage closet of a sandwich shop.

201
00:10:36,621 --> 00:10:38,623
I swear to God, you had to suck in your chest

202
00:10:38,663 --> 00:10:40,845
to get past the garbage bins to get into the door.

203
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:45,009
And every Friday night, we would invite people out.

204
00:10:46,027 --> 00:10:49,908
bring a bunch of beer and just put people through this VR experience. They had no idea what to

205
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:57,012
expect and uh we just studied whenever they felt sick or didn't want to play and we just kept

206
00:10:57,092 --> 00:11:05,236
iterating, iterating, iterating until nobody got motion sick whatsoever. Um so you can see

207
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:12,779
here we we we took this thing to an open source conference um and this is before we had fully

208
00:11:12,819 --> 00:11:15,000
realized it but you can see that um this is um this is something from December 2016 on

209
00:11:15,882 --> 00:11:17,582
the wind is placed directly above him.

210
00:11:19,283 --> 00:11:21,745
But what we came to realize is that

211
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:24,786
if you're blasting someone with a lot of air

212
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:31,210
and then you turn that air off and then you put a helicopter above them...

213
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,265
you can put that air back on.

214
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:35,326
It really doesn't matter what direction it's coming from.

215
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:37,686
They are convinced that that helicopter

216
00:11:37,766 --> 00:11:38,907
is what's generating that air

217
00:11:38,987 --> 00:11:40,307
and it's coming down on top of them.

218
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:44,128
So we actually removed ceiling fans from all our designs

219
00:11:44,228 --> 00:11:46,409
because for our application where the player

220
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:47,729
is standing in the same spot,

221
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:51,330
it was almost 100% reliant on the visual indicators

222
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,050
of where that source of air was coming from.

223
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:58,226
We use infrared heaters for instant effect.

224
00:11:58,366 --> 00:12:00,707
Infrared is really neat because it heats the water

225
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,428
in your skin with microwaves,

226
00:12:02,908 --> 00:12:04,649
which sounds really scary, but it's not.

227
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:08,810
And so that's really nice for interactive applications

228
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,811
where you're passing by lava

229
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:12,492
or you have an explosion next to you,

230
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:14,593
you can really feel that heat instantaneously.

231
00:12:17,314 --> 00:12:20,375
This is a screenshot from one of our first titles called Hair.

232
00:12:22,247 --> 00:12:30,475
There's two things going on here. The villain is shooting lasers at your vessel and at first we

233
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:36,400
didn't have any kind of ambient light but we turned on the heat to represent those lasers cooking

234
00:12:37,702 --> 00:12:38,062
above you.

235
00:12:39,713 --> 00:12:40,694
And people thought it was cool,

236
00:12:40,734 --> 00:12:42,075
some people didn't even notice the heat.

237
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:45,378
But as soon as we put ambient red light

238
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:48,701
glowing all around you, it was just crazy.

239
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:50,342
Heat became the star of the show.

240
00:12:50,742 --> 00:12:52,644
And it was always the first thing people said

241
00:12:52,764 --> 00:12:54,085
when they got off the ride, they said,

242
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:56,227
and that heat was just insane.

243
00:12:56,267 --> 00:12:59,129
And it was just, all we changed was a visual indicator

244
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:00,310
that they should be feeling hot.

245
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:03,512
And then the other thing to notice here is that

246
00:13:04,113 --> 00:13:07,416
you'll see these spring coils on all four sides.

247
00:13:08,612 --> 00:13:12,736
And we found that there's a lot of subtle movement happening.

248
00:13:13,076 --> 00:13:15,238
And when you don't have a frame of reference,

249
00:13:15,258 --> 00:13:17,601
like a building going by you, or trees,

250
00:13:17,641 --> 00:13:20,583
or anything within proximity to really highlight the fact

251
00:13:20,623 --> 00:13:24,948
that you're moving, those springs give peripheral vision,

252
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:28,131
give indicators that the floor is actually

253
00:13:28,171 --> 00:13:29,913
moving and doing stuff, and really

254
00:13:29,953 --> 00:13:32,015
helps highlight the fact that you are moving.

255
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:38,861
You have to promise my wife I didn't use this photo.

256
00:13:40,382 --> 00:13:43,985
I told her I wouldn't, but I had my fingers crossed behind my back.

257
00:13:46,347 --> 00:13:51,611
This is just a great example of the fact that she would never ever play this VR game when

258
00:13:51,652 --> 00:13:52,372
people were around.

259
00:13:53,288 --> 00:13:55,109
But as soon as people left the room,

260
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,989
she would strike a pose, she played the game,

261
00:13:58,009 --> 00:13:58,709
and she loved it.

262
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,850
But it was only when it was just her and I.

263
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,050
So this is a really tough nut to crack

264
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,611
because at an arcade, you're just surrounded

265
00:14:07,651 --> 00:14:10,111
by random people, it's very hard to escape that.

266
00:14:10,571 --> 00:14:13,892
So our solution was to basically enclose the player

267
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:16,912
in a somewhat private space,

268
00:14:16,952 --> 00:14:19,413
so you're kind of going into the experience

269
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:21,093
and closed off from the outside world.

270
00:14:21,113 --> 00:14:22,653
And this ended up being very effective.

271
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:30,785
And then the last thing is this is a video of our motion test.

272
00:14:30,805 --> 00:14:35,569
We've got 800 pounds of sandbags testing our motion floor.

273
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,171
And the really interesting thing here

274
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:41,794
is that we started by just updating

275
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:44,696
the position of the actuators in our game update loop, which

276
00:14:45,632 --> 00:14:47,412
For like a console, 60 frames a second.

277
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:49,553
For VR, it's hopefully 90 frames a second.

278
00:14:50,413 --> 00:14:52,973
But I could feel the motor stepping, right?

279
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:55,234
I could feel the resolution of that motion.

280
00:14:56,034 --> 00:14:58,395
And so we started increasing it and increasing it

281
00:14:58,415 --> 00:14:58,855
and increasing it.

282
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,336
It wasn't until around 240 frames a second

283
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:03,576
that it did feel buttery smooth,

284
00:15:04,076 --> 00:15:06,217
where I could not feel the motion stepping.

285
00:15:06,237 --> 00:15:09,498
And what's really interesting about this notion is that

286
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:17,054
I was researching online how to manage threads in Unity that are updating a lot faster than

287
00:15:17,094 --> 00:15:18,154
the main core loop.

288
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:20,756
And I came across a guy who had solved it.

289
00:15:21,497 --> 00:15:27,200
I looked up his username and I dug deeper and here he was making a VR controller with

290
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,223
haptics built into it so you could feel like when you had a sword battle it would feel

291
00:15:31,243 --> 00:15:35,205
like the controller was bending or you toss a whip you could feel like it was recoiling.

292
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:37,589
and he came to the same exact conclusion

293
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:39,690
that you needed a little over 200 frames a second

294
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,831
for that to feel smooth.

295
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:47,594
So, all of our experiences so far have been on rails.

296
00:15:48,794 --> 00:15:51,595
And it's really easy to not get players motion sickness

297
00:15:51,635 --> 00:15:52,916
when they're not controlling the motion.

298
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:55,917
But when you give them control,

299
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:57,758
it becomes a lot more difficult

300
00:15:57,798 --> 00:15:59,279
to ensure they're not doing anything

301
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:01,080
that's gonna cause either the rider

302
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,380
or the passenger to get sick.

303
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:05,121
So, the lessons learned here.

304
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:07,949
are that you need to get out of the building,

305
00:16:08,229 --> 00:16:09,229
which I'll explain in a minute.

306
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,011
The safest path to no motion sickness is no yaw,

307
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:15,071
and that just basically means

308
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:16,752
you can't twist on your y-axis.

309
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:20,893
If you do want yaw, you're gonna need guardrails,

310
00:16:20,993 --> 00:16:23,054
assuming it's not an open-world exploration game.

311
00:16:23,494 --> 00:16:24,895
You're gonna need some kind of guardrails

312
00:16:24,915 --> 00:16:25,835
to keep them on the path.

313
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:31,016
And finally, do not rely on real physics.

314
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:37,137
So, we had this prototype product called the Hyperdrive,

315
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,080
and the front player there would lean left and right

316
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,023
to steer the vehicle, we just measured your head,

317
00:16:44,323 --> 00:16:46,064
or your HMDs offset from center

318
00:16:46,385 --> 00:16:47,726
to lean it like a motorcycle,

319
00:16:47,886 --> 00:16:49,647
and then the back player had a turret gun

320
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:52,630
much like the Hyperdeck.

321
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,692
And the get out of the building lesson

322
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:59,235
is something I learned early on in software development

323
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:00,837
that I did not listen to here, but...

324
00:17:01,883 --> 00:17:03,865
When you're behind a computer all day working away,

325
00:17:03,885 --> 00:17:05,967
you're feeling productive, you're making a lot of choices

326
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:07,208
and making a lot of assumptions

327
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,630
that you know what your users want

328
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,712
and you're building the perfect solution for them.

329
00:17:11,432 --> 00:17:12,533
And so get out of the building means

330
00:17:12,553 --> 00:17:14,055
you need to get off your computer,

331
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,558
you need to get out and talk to your customers, right?

332
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,020
You've got to interface with them and get their feedback.

333
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,843
And so with this product...

334
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:27,042
We spent a lot of time talking about where we're going to put

335
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:27,622
the TV.

336
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:31,606
And the TV serves as a way for the spectators to see what's

337
00:17:31,646 --> 00:17:34,048
happening with the players in VR.

338
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:38,372
And so we thought we had this genius idea that it would be

339
00:17:38,452 --> 00:17:39,292
on the front here.

340
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:43,356
And there's transparent sides on each side of the TV.

341
00:17:43,376 --> 00:17:45,518
So you could kind of see through the players playing,

342
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:48,080
but then kind of have a portal right into

343
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,221
what they're playing.

344
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:51,043
So we took it to the trade show.

345
00:17:52,765 --> 00:17:56,926
I kid you not, every single freaking person came up and said,

346
00:17:56,946 --> 00:17:59,027
hey, why'd you put the TV on the back?

347
00:18:01,908 --> 00:18:03,128
And we were like, what are you talking about?

348
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:03,688
That's the front.

349
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,549
And they're like, oh no, no,

350
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:06,009
I'm pushing that up against the wall.

351
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,270
And so we didn't realize,

352
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,091
we didn't show our design to an operator and said,

353
00:18:11,111 --> 00:18:13,012
you know, how would you prefer to configure this

354
00:18:13,252 --> 00:18:13,932
in your space?

355
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,713
And so that was a really, really hard lesson learned.

356
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:20,074
Then COVID happened.

357
00:18:20,174 --> 00:18:21,334
We won't talk about any of that,

358
00:18:21,554 --> 00:18:21,715
but...

359
00:18:23,582 --> 00:18:25,103
So, know y'all.

360
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,844
An easy way to think about this is like Spy Hunter, right?

361
00:18:27,884 --> 00:18:30,726
It's a straight road, and you're letting the person turn,

362
00:18:31,126 --> 00:18:33,127
but they're just basically sliding left and right

363
00:18:33,167 --> 00:18:33,928
to change lanes.

364
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,889
It's gonna be a really fun game concept or game mechanic,

365
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,031
but it's also pretty limiting.

366
00:18:39,891 --> 00:18:43,253
If you wanna add y'all, you've gotta create guardrails

367
00:18:43,293 --> 00:18:44,454
that keep them on the course,

368
00:18:44,574 --> 00:18:47,476
because not everybody has their driver's license yet

369
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:48,416
that's gonna play your game.

370
00:18:49,474 --> 00:18:53,457
So as you'll see here, this is before we had implemented some safety measures, and this

371
00:18:53,517 --> 00:19:03,744
is what happens when a bad driver can slam, slam, slam, slam.

372
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:08,928
And I think you can imagine that the rear player especially is probably ready to barf.

373
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:15,290
So this is just a great example of an early test

374
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,770
and us getting out of the building

375
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,951
or bringing people to our building

376
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,292
to test out these mechanics.

377
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:22,493
I don't have a diagram for this,

378
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:24,254
but the easiest way to explain the solution

379
00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:26,115
that we arrived at for this is that

380
00:19:26,995 --> 00:19:29,697
if you hit the guardrail at a very soft impact

381
00:19:29,977 --> 00:19:32,938
or a small vector, we'll just bounce you back off, right?

382
00:19:33,158 --> 00:19:34,539
It's a pretty low impact.

383
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:37,100
But if you come in at a really hard angle,

384
00:19:38,247 --> 00:19:41,569
we will let you go through the guardrail, fade to black,

385
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:43,890
and then reset you to the middle of the track.

386
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,031
This way there's no harsh impact,

387
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:49,152
you're penalized for doing it, and nobody gets sick.

388
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:52,694
But the angle of that vector and the speed of that vector

389
00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:54,555
is up to you to iterate on

390
00:19:54,615 --> 00:19:56,376
and see what works best for your application.

391
00:19:59,057 --> 00:20:02,939
And then finally, don't rely on real physics.

392
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,840
So you can see here,

393
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,081
this guy's about to take a series of jumps.

394
00:20:09,887 --> 00:20:12,869
And on the last jump, he corrects himself.

395
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:17,172
I realize it's pretty small.

396
00:20:19,394 --> 00:20:20,495
But he's veering off the road

397
00:20:20,575 --> 00:20:22,216
and he slams back on just in time.

398
00:20:23,017 --> 00:20:27,280
And a fun way to look at that is going back to Super Mario,

399
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,421
the original Mario Brothers game.

400
00:20:29,922 --> 00:20:32,904
Mario jumps really fast and he falls really slow.

401
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:34,566
But while he's falling,

402
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:36,827
you can actually move him left and right.

403
00:20:37,827 --> 00:20:40,430
and that's obviously not realistic at all,

404
00:20:40,971 --> 00:20:45,696
but it's important to give players that level of control

405
00:20:45,736 --> 00:20:46,857
so they can self-correct.

406
00:20:47,358 --> 00:20:50,261
So originally with this game, once you ramped,

407
00:20:50,401 --> 00:20:51,582
we were just relying on physics

408
00:20:51,602 --> 00:20:53,224
to let you fly through the air,

409
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:56,247
and people were ultimately getting very sick

410
00:20:56,327 --> 00:20:58,289
because you can't project where you're gonna go

411
00:20:58,409 --> 00:20:59,090
once you hit a ramp.

412
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:03,375
And so all these things came together.

413
00:21:03,435 --> 00:21:05,897
We launched SpongeBob SquarePants Dynamic Duo

414
00:21:06,657 --> 00:21:09,539
last fall in Orlando at the IAAPA Expo.

415
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:11,080
And this is just a fun series of events.

416
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,300
Oh, yeah!

417
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:11,360
Oh!

418
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:11,460
Oh!

419
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:11,540
Oh!

420
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:11,660
Oh!

421
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:11,740
Oh!

422
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:11,800
Oh!

423
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:11,860
Oh!

424
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:11,960
Oh!

425
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,020
Oh!

426
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,080
Oh!

427
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,140
Oh!

428
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,260
Oh!

429
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:12,380
Oh!

430
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:12,480
Oh!

431
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:12,600
Oh!

432
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,141
Oh!

433
00:21:15,342 --> 00:21:15,482
Oh!

434
00:21:15,502 --> 00:21:15,542
Oh!

435
00:21:15,602 --> 00:21:15,802
Oh!

436
00:21:17,463 --> 00:21:17,563
Oh!

437
00:21:17,683 --> 00:21:17,803
Oh!

438
00:21:17,863 --> 00:21:21,125
Oh my god!

439
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:26,008
Oh my god!

440
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:26,088
Oh!

441
00:21:26,108 --> 00:21:26,208
Oh!

442
00:21:26,228 --> 00:21:26,288
Oh!

443
00:21:26,308 --> 00:21:26,368
Oh!

444
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:26,528
Oh!

445
00:21:26,548 --> 00:21:26,588
Oh!

446
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:26,668
Oh!

447
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:26,829
Oh!

448
00:21:26,889 --> 00:21:26,929
Oh!

449
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:27,069
Oh!

450
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:27,289
Oh!

451
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:27,389
Oh!

452
00:21:51,805 --> 00:21:55,707
So it wasn't obvious in that video, but the player in the back is actually delivering

453
00:21:55,987 --> 00:21:56,728
Krabby Patties.

454
00:21:57,308 --> 00:21:59,969
It's inspired by the Paperboy game.

455
00:22:00,608 --> 00:22:02,449
where you're shooting at windows, other cars,

456
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:04,009
launching them into driveways.

457
00:22:07,531 --> 00:22:08,891
I'm a little early, of course.

458
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:10,692
The dry runs were a lot longer,

459
00:22:10,852 --> 00:22:13,733
but I hope you learned something today.

460
00:22:13,753 --> 00:22:15,974
I guess I can open it up to some questions

461
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:16,835
if anybody has them.

462
00:22:22,656 --> 00:22:24,678
First off, this is a really fantastic talk.

463
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,019
I feel like I learned so much.

464
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,861
Really specific, good.

465
00:22:29,002 --> 00:22:31,424
So who was doing most of the motion sickness testing?

466
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:34,127
Well, I'm a great litmus test

467
00:22:34,167 --> 00:22:36,289
because I get sick super easy.

468
00:22:37,711 --> 00:22:39,292
But really, it was always internal

469
00:22:39,813 --> 00:22:42,215
and then we just invited beta testers out.

470
00:22:42,756 --> 00:22:42,996
Awesome.

471
00:22:45,988 --> 00:22:48,870
Hi, great talk, thank you for taking the time and energy

472
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,691
to tell us about this and put this together.

473
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:53,654
So I'm curious from an accessibility standpoint,

474
00:22:53,694 --> 00:22:57,296
I've worked in museum places and things like ADA guidelines

475
00:22:57,356 --> 00:23:00,099
and things like those are usually pretty concrete and set,

476
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:01,980
so I'm curious about how you approach this

477
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,761
from an accessibility perspective

478
00:23:03,981 --> 00:23:06,303
and what those play tests might have looked like.

479
00:23:06,683 --> 00:23:07,644
That's a great question.

480
00:23:08,425 --> 00:23:11,867
So the HyperDeck was built with accessibility in mind

481
00:23:12,068 --> 00:23:15,170
in that the HyperDeck comes with a portable ramp

482
00:23:16,012 --> 00:23:17,752
that you can bring out and lay down.

483
00:23:18,613 --> 00:23:21,554
And there's enough room to put a wheelchair on.

484
00:23:21,714 --> 00:23:23,655
And if you lock the wheels, it is playable.

485
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:27,697
The SpongeBob game is not as accessible.

486
00:23:28,377 --> 00:23:32,519
But in our industry, ultimately, a lot of the accessibility

487
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:33,599
falls on the operator.

488
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,501
So we will do our best to create a ride that's

489
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:37,361
accessible to all.

490
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:39,842
But the nature of motion especially,

491
00:23:40,863 --> 00:23:41,923
sometimes it's impossible.

492
00:23:42,932 --> 00:23:43,752
Great question, thank you.

493
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:44,452
Yeah, thanks.

494
00:23:44,692 --> 00:23:48,114
Yeah, I work in VR, so that's an important topic,

495
00:23:48,154 --> 00:23:49,174
but something that shouldn't be,

496
00:23:50,475 --> 00:23:51,495
you know, you shouldn't be afraid of it,

497
00:23:51,655 --> 00:23:52,215
asking this question.

498
00:23:52,235 --> 00:23:54,636
So I appreciate you taking the time to even dive into it.

499
00:23:54,876 --> 00:23:56,597
I'm sure you thought about it, but that's all.

500
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:59,258
Well, I'll say this, something I didn't talk about,

501
00:23:59,498 --> 00:24:01,899
but when we first launched the HyperDeck,

502
00:24:02,619 --> 00:24:04,860
I thought for sure everybody's first question

503
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,001
was gonna be, how much does this thing cost?

504
00:24:07,561 --> 00:24:07,781
Yeah.

505
00:24:07,901 --> 00:24:08,441
But it wasn't.

506
00:24:09,022 --> 00:24:10,382
The first question everybody asked was,

507
00:24:10,422 --> 00:24:11,483
is how big is this thing?

508
00:24:12,331 --> 00:24:13,792
because they don't care how much it costs

509
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,473
if it doesn't fit into their facility.

510
00:24:15,713 --> 00:24:17,574
And the HyperDeck is a really big product.

511
00:24:18,694 --> 00:24:21,595
And so wheelchair ramps take up a lot of space.

512
00:24:22,156 --> 00:24:25,077
So ultimately that flexibility is left to the operator

513
00:24:25,137 --> 00:24:27,378
to figure out how it best works in their facility.

514
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:31,440
So we've actually had some places build a permanent ramp

515
00:24:31,961 --> 00:24:33,741
that goes out and then twists around

516
00:24:33,781 --> 00:24:34,902
the side of the HyperDeck.

517
00:24:36,103 --> 00:24:37,503
Because that's just the way it needed

518
00:24:37,523 --> 00:24:38,844
to work for their facility.

519
00:24:39,064 --> 00:24:39,524
That's awesome.

520
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:39,984
Thank you.

521
00:24:43,002 --> 00:24:43,484
Anything else?

522
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,331
All right.

523
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:47,253
Well, thank you very much.

524
00:24:47,373 --> 00:24:47,875
We got one.

525
00:24:48,135 --> 00:24:48,596
We got one.

526
00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:55,006
You mentioned 240 frames a second for the haptic feedback.

527
00:24:55,827 --> 00:25:02,972
Was that just the feedback, was that the rate for ramping values, or is that sort of the speed of the phrases?

528
00:25:03,412 --> 00:25:09,676
You know, so you were talking about a tick, so you have to have something that's continuous at 240 FPS,

529
00:25:09,696 --> 00:25:13,459
but what was the fastest speed that you rendered sort of haptic phrases at?

530
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:22,142
I'm not sure I totally understand the question, but I can say that with our actuators, we're sending absolute positions

531
00:25:22,742 --> 00:25:28,504
So much like an mp3 file compresses a perfect sine wave into stair steps. Yeah, that's what we have to do

532
00:25:28,764 --> 00:25:33,726
Okay, so you're sending smaller and smaller stair steps the faster our iteration is

533
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,871
And in terms of hitting new targets,

534
00:25:38,592 --> 00:25:40,592
what sort of speeds were you hitting?

535
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:43,813
In our industry, you don't want to go over 1G force.

536
00:25:44,413 --> 00:25:45,774
So the speed that you do,

537
00:25:45,974 --> 00:25:47,854
and there's tools you can use to measure the G force,

538
00:25:48,294 --> 00:25:52,996
if you go over 1G, F24, get guidelines by ASTM,

539
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:54,836
require a restraint.

540
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:57,597
So that's kind of our limit is 1G.

541
00:25:57,617 --> 00:25:58,918
Cool, thank you.

542
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:00,098
I hope that answers your question.

543
00:26:00,118 --> 00:26:03,079
Thanks.

544
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:03,799
Hey, thanks for the talk.

545
00:26:04,427 --> 00:26:10,332
I'm wondering when you're designing games for arcades, obviously you're going to be encountering a lot of first-time VR players

546
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:14,695
So how do you strike the right balance between fun gameplay and easy to pick up?

547
00:26:15,516 --> 00:26:18,579
Yeah, easy to learn hard to master right? It's our ultimate mantra

548
00:26:20,483 --> 00:26:27,185
It's tough. Something like the Spongebob game is great because um it's really intuitive to just

549
00:26:27,245 --> 00:26:33,047
lean like you're on a motorcycle. And we have a very very brief tutorial uh in the beginning

550
00:26:33,067 --> 00:26:38,389
that just shows up on screen. There's no way to skip it but we do try our best to make it at

551
00:26:38,469 --> 00:26:45,252
minimal. Um and in cases like hair, that game I showed you earlier, we actually have a

552
00:26:45,292 --> 00:26:49,593
tutorial that only pops up if you fail to start playing it the way we anticipate.

553
00:26:50,313 --> 00:26:53,234
So people that repeat the game never actually see

554
00:26:53,755 --> 00:26:56,475
any GUI overlays, but the people that just sit there

555
00:26:56,495 --> 00:26:58,276
and don't pull the triggers to fire their weapon,

556
00:26:58,636 --> 00:27:01,237
they'll have indicators coming out of what you should do.

557
00:27:01,937 --> 00:27:04,138
So that's just kind of a way we try to eliminate it

558
00:27:04,158 --> 00:27:05,558
for those that have come back to play again.

559
00:27:05,578 --> 00:27:06,799
Cool, thanks.

560
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:07,219
Yep.

561
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,461
You're moving floor, is that moving in response

562
00:27:13,481 --> 00:27:15,802
to the user's input or is it all scripted on Rails?

563
00:27:16,126 --> 00:27:20,829
So the hyperdeck is on rails, meaning we create the script

564
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:21,549
that moves it.

565
00:27:21,589 --> 00:27:22,649
It's the same every time.

566
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:26,912
Now that said, when the players fire their weapons,

567
00:27:26,952 --> 00:27:29,233
there is haptic feedback in the floor that responds to

568
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,514
that, but it's not a lot.

569
00:27:30,534 --> 00:27:31,874
It's just enough to feel like a gunshot.

570
00:27:32,675 --> 00:27:35,736
With the SpongeBob game, it's the driver in the front

571
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:38,638
leaning left and right that ultimately dictates the motion.

572
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:41,720
I have often wondered how you'd be able to simulate that.

573
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,741
Have you ever experimented with something like a vehicle

574
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:44,221
where you want to?

575
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:48,744
the player accelerates and then you can actually do the tilting and making them feel.

576
00:27:49,024 --> 00:27:53,750
So one thing we do that I would say is different than our competition is that we use 6 inch

577
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,433
stroke meaning actuators can move 6 inches.

578
00:27:56,914 --> 00:27:58,656
Most people use inch and a half or 3 inches.

579
00:27:59,438 --> 00:28:02,240
But the interesting thing about the GeForce simulation

580
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,701
that I talked about is that if somebody's rolled

581
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:06,382
to the right as far as they can go,

582
00:28:07,022 --> 00:28:08,623
well then there's really no resolution left

583
00:28:08,643 --> 00:28:10,044
because the actuators are maxed out.

584
00:28:10,284 --> 00:28:11,645
So with our six inch actuators,

585
00:28:12,045 --> 00:28:14,007
we actually only dedicate three or four inches

586
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:15,267
to the player motion.

587
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:18,289
That still leaves a buffer for us to add effects

588
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:20,110
and do those GeForce kind of tricks

589
00:28:20,771 --> 00:28:23,252
and not max out the actuators, if that makes sense.

590
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:23,552
Yeah.

591
00:28:24,153 --> 00:28:25,113
Yeah, thank you.

592
00:28:28,513 --> 00:28:31,634
I'm curious, is there a target duration that you go for?

593
00:28:31,874 --> 00:28:34,535
At what point does the experience become too much?

594
00:28:35,355 --> 00:28:37,236
That's a really, really great question,

595
00:28:37,376 --> 00:28:40,156
and one that has changed a lot over time.

596
00:28:40,676 --> 00:28:42,177
Has anybody ever heard of zero latency?

597
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:46,178
It's like a free room warehouse scale experience.

598
00:28:47,918 --> 00:28:49,478
You know, they were pretty early to the scene,

599
00:28:49,538 --> 00:28:50,779
and somebody we looked up to,

600
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:52,639
and they were doing zombie games.

601
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:54,320
It took like 45 frickin' minutes.

602
00:28:55,511 --> 00:29:00,995
And people, uh, VR gurus out there were saying, the longer you're immersed, the better, the

603
00:29:01,035 --> 00:29:06,379
more money they'll pay. And uh, so early on with the HyperDeck, we were targeting 15 minute

604
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,183
games. And as soon as we started putting it out there, people didn't like that at all

605
00:29:11,223 --> 00:29:15,286
because there's a lot of standing around waiting. Uh, they felt like they weren't making as

606
00:29:15,326 --> 00:29:20,169
much money with a faster throughput. So we ultimately lowered the HyperDeck games to 8

607
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:20,530
minutes.

608
00:29:22,003 --> 00:29:23,744
and even that is a struggle,

609
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:25,766
and we're releasing a new title soon

610
00:29:25,786 --> 00:29:27,947
that's gonna have a short five minute option.

611
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:31,710
The SpongeBob is actually adaptable

612
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,830
from three to six minutes,

613
00:29:33,551 --> 00:29:35,733
and I would say most operators prefer around five minutes.

614
00:29:36,993 --> 00:29:38,094
So it really just depends,

615
00:29:38,555 --> 00:29:40,176
your throughput, what you can charge,

616
00:29:40,596 --> 00:29:41,617
you know, the cost per minute,

617
00:29:42,497 --> 00:29:44,158
but giving your operators flexibility

618
00:29:44,198 --> 00:29:45,619
is really the ultimate way to do it.

619
00:29:49,102 --> 00:29:50,343
All right, well thank you so much.

620
00:29:50,363 --> 00:29:51,223
Appreciate it.
