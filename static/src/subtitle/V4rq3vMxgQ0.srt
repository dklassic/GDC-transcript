1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,661
My name is Nicolas Doucet.

2
00:00:06,842 --> 00:00:09,443
I'm the creative director and producer of the game

3
00:00:09,504 --> 00:00:12,686
over at SIE Worldwide Studio, Japan Studio.

4
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:16,268
And first things first, on behalf of the Asobi team,

5
00:00:16,408 --> 00:00:17,409
the other people behind the game,

6
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:19,911
I want to say a big thank you for coming today.

7
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:22,253
So we're going to be together for about one hour.

8
00:00:22,353 --> 00:00:24,154
And I hope it will be both informative

9
00:00:24,194 --> 00:00:25,555
and that we can have fun together as well.

10
00:00:26,636 --> 00:00:30,639
OK, so if you are new to Astro Bot Rescue Mission,

11
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:31,259
here's a quick video.

12
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:12,554
All right.

13
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:14,199
So if you like the music of the game,

14
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:15,182
the composer is in the room.

15
00:01:15,222 --> 00:01:17,809
You can approach him to work on your game.

16
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:20,176
All right.

17
00:01:24,987 --> 00:01:27,409
Okay, so Astro Bot Rescue Mission, it's a VR platformer.

18
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,452
It was released last October for PSVR,

19
00:01:29,512 --> 00:01:31,974
and it was Asobi Team's first commercial title.

20
00:01:32,835 --> 00:01:33,616
So if you'll allow me today,

21
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:34,998
we're gonna, I'd like to take you on a journey

22
00:01:35,698 --> 00:01:37,480
and show you how we got around to making this game.

23
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,662
There's quite a lot of content,

24
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,123
so I'm going to be going quite fast.

25
00:01:40,724 --> 00:01:41,765
If I end up speaking too fast

26
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:42,886
and you can't understand what I'm saying,

27
00:01:42,906 --> 00:01:45,329
just, you know, wave and we'll get there.

28
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,993
So a little bit, before we go on that journey, I just want to rewind a tiny bit and introduce a little bit about myself.

29
00:01:51,074 --> 00:01:58,119
So I grew up in the south of France in the 80s, and my youth was pretty much made up of nature, organic things,

30
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:05,064
and a lot of Japanese anime, and of course a lot of video games, like you guys I'm sure, you know, from both America, but with a strong influence from Japan.

31
00:02:06,637 --> 00:02:12,240
At 18 I moved to UK, I began a career in games, I worked as a QA, a tester, for companies

32
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,502
like Eidos, EA, and eventually I entered LEGO.

33
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:19,704
I was exposed to the family game market for the first time, and it was a really wonderful

34
00:02:19,744 --> 00:02:22,246
time, really on board a really, really wonderful family.

35
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:26,262
And five years later, I entered London studio,

36
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:28,923
still at Sony Computer Entertainment.

37
00:02:29,243 --> 00:02:31,084
And I was expecting to find a really kind of

38
00:02:31,144 --> 00:02:32,285
cold, hard tech company.

39
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:33,505
Of course, it was PlayStation,

40
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:35,766
but I expected to find a lot of kind of techie guys.

41
00:02:35,826 --> 00:02:38,007
But in the end, I was surprised to find a studio

42
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:39,128
focused on the family market,

43
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:40,608
with games like Sync Star, Eye Toy.

44
00:02:41,129 --> 00:02:43,190
And so I joined the studio as a producer

45
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,110
on the Eye Toy franchise.

46
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,571
And during the PS3 era,

47
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:48,052
I worked on an augmented reality game.

48
00:02:48,412 --> 00:02:50,313
And that was my first time as a creative director.

49
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:51,913
And then I made a big move.

50
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:56,968
In 2011, I said goodbye to fish and chips and hello to sushi,

51
00:02:57,249 --> 00:02:58,310
and I moved to Japan Studio.

52
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,093
It was like a kid's dream, really, for somebody like me

53
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:05,096
who grew up playing video games from Japan.

54
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,580
In 2012, Asobi Team was formed.

55
00:03:08,781 --> 00:03:13,282
So the team mission was to research gameplay

56
00:03:13,302 --> 00:03:14,583
using the new PlayStation hardware.

57
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:18,164
And by the way, the name Asobi in Japan means to play.

58
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:22,526
And we picked it because it should be a reminder that we

59
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:23,967
should all be about play.

60
00:03:24,007 --> 00:03:25,868
And it's something I borrowed from LEGO, actually, which is

61
00:03:25,928 --> 00:03:30,610
also part of how the name LEGO came to be.

62
00:03:31,772 --> 00:03:36,257
And this is a world exclusive, it's a sneak peak, well it's not a sneak peak, an old peak

63
00:03:36,437 --> 00:03:39,882
at some of the iteration of the DualShock 4 controllers that we got to work with.

64
00:03:40,983 --> 00:03:44,667
And using these controllers we will try to come up with gameplay prototypes that could

65
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:47,451
showcase the new features and also share them with other developers.

66
00:03:49,788 --> 00:03:52,691
The way we work is that we organize our thinking around four creative pillars.

67
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:55,093
They're magical, innovative, playful, and inclusive.

68
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:58,416
And these pillars really define the DNA of the team.

69
00:03:58,496 --> 00:04:01,640
And even Astro Boat was created with these four key pillars in mind.

70
00:04:03,642 --> 00:04:06,846
Then we spend quite a bit of time brainstorming with the team

71
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:08,849
how to use these new technologies.

72
00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:12,593
It's a relaxing time where everybody gets to get all their ideas out.

73
00:04:13,334 --> 00:04:15,857
And of course, we have game designers, but we like to think that actually

74
00:04:15,937 --> 00:04:18,461
there is a game designer in every one of the team members,

75
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:21,324
whether they're programmers, artists, or audio producers.

76
00:04:23,086 --> 00:04:27,649
And then our ideas kind of all go on Post-it. It all begins on a Post-it to be honest.

77
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,951
And these are all of our walls in the office.

78
00:04:30,832 --> 00:04:34,795
And the concept of Astrobot along with all the game mechanics started on Post-its like this.

79
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,861
So once we select an idea, we turn it

80
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:40,722
into a very, very basic design document.

81
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:42,683
We don't do big design docs.

82
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:45,344
And these are mostly visual with minimal text.

83
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:46,965
And the reason for that is because we

84
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:48,706
want to visualize the experience really quickly,

85
00:04:48,846 --> 00:04:50,787
but also because writing and reading in Japanese

86
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:52,968
and in English for us is actually quite a big hurdle.

87
00:04:54,049 --> 00:04:56,710
So we prefer simple sketches and talking face to face.

88
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,651
It's quite a fairly old school way of working.

89
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:00,652
It's very much like an indie team.

90
00:05:00,772 --> 00:05:02,433
But we find that it works really well for us.

91
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:06,540
So once we've decided on a prototype,

92
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,961
to create a prototype would generally take two weeks

93
00:05:09,302 --> 00:05:10,102
for a core mechanics.

94
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:12,143
So for example, a boss battle in Astro Bot

95
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:14,185
would have been two weeks of this programmer.

96
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:16,646
And so that makes the gameplay programmers

97
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:19,428
really central pieces to our development

98
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:21,409
because they are the beginning of everything, really.

99
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:24,191
It is them who are going to give the gameplay

100
00:05:24,231 --> 00:05:25,732
that initial kind of burst.

101
00:05:26,813 --> 00:05:30,135
And so later I will show you lots of prototypes,

102
00:05:30,175 --> 00:05:31,296
of course, for this presentation.

103
00:05:32,701 --> 00:05:34,402
So going back to all the days as a team,

104
00:05:34,683 --> 00:05:38,186
after creating lots of tech demos, we kind of polished them.

105
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:40,628
And the best ones were eventually

106
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:42,949
put together inside the PS4, known as the Playroom.

107
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,471
So perhaps you've known the Playroom.

108
00:05:45,852 --> 00:05:48,514
And it contributed to giving PS4 a warm, inclusive image

109
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:48,894
at launch.

110
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:50,616
But you needed a camera to play this game.

111
00:05:51,877 --> 00:05:53,418
It was a great training ground for the team as well,

112
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:55,740
because many of the members actually never

113
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,661
worked on a game before.

114
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:57,702
It was their first time ever.

115
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,460
In 2013, the VR headset project Morpheus came along,

116
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,041
and so we jumped on the opportunity

117
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:08,044
to reiterate with this kind of gameplay research.

118
00:06:08,784 --> 00:06:12,026
And we started researching new opportunities to play in VR.

119
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:16,669
So once again, we created many demos, particularly

120
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:17,770
around multiplayer.

121
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,332
So we had this concept of being able to play in VR and on a TV.

122
00:06:23,561 --> 00:06:26,322
And I did a talk in GDC in 2015, I think, about this.

123
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:28,083
So if you want to know more about these prototypes,

124
00:06:28,103 --> 00:06:29,263
you can look at that.

125
00:06:29,543 --> 00:06:31,744
And during that phase of trials,

126
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:34,325
we also tried third-person platforming.

127
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:36,305
And that was strange because it felt really like,

128
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:38,426
it wasn't very much like a VR.

129
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:40,847
VR should be a first-person, virtual hands.

130
00:06:41,347 --> 00:06:43,128
But we kind of wanted to try it, and we did.

131
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:46,149
And we found it actually was pretty cool.

132
00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:48,650
And this is what it looked like.

133
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,730
It's our first VR platformer prototype.

134
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,801
So as you can see, some of Astro Bot's trademark,

135
00:06:56,262 --> 00:06:58,122
like jumping around, jumping from the controller,

136
00:06:58,323 --> 00:06:59,623
were already in there from the beginning.

137
00:07:00,383 --> 00:07:01,664
And the controls were very simple.

138
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:02,865
You can move around and jump.

139
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:04,685
There was no punching or enemies at the time.

140
00:07:07,447 --> 00:07:11,148
And then we included moving into Z, you know,

141
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:12,749
so navigation.

142
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,510
And finally, the character looking back at you,

143
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,231
that was something that we did a quick test for

144
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,892
and we thought that it gives a lot of charm

145
00:07:19,992 --> 00:07:21,093
to the experience.

146
00:07:22,743 --> 00:07:24,785
And then eventually it became Robot Rescue.

147
00:07:25,185 --> 00:07:29,970
And Robot Rescue was included as part of the Playroom VR.

148
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,131
And it was a single stage.

149
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:33,713
It figured a character.

150
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:35,374
At the time, there was no Astro Bot.

151
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,376
But the core mechanics were there.

152
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,497
You could rescue little robots.

153
00:07:38,537 --> 00:07:40,759
There was one gadget, which was the hook shot.

154
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,722
Some verticality, some vertical gameplay.

155
00:07:45,518 --> 00:07:46,959
And the whole game lasted about 15 minutes,

156
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:49,600
and it was created by half a dozen people

157
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:50,701
in three to four months.

158
00:07:50,881 --> 00:07:52,642
It was part of a bigger game collection.

159
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:55,464
And the bigger collection, it was called the Playroom VR,

160
00:07:55,504 --> 00:07:57,566
and it was mostly a big party game.

161
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:02,474
And as a result, Robot Rescue was kind of the old one out,

162
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:02,695
really.

163
00:08:02,955 --> 00:08:04,256
But we put it in because we really,

164
00:08:04,636 --> 00:08:06,498
if we didn't put it in at that time,

165
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:07,479
it would have just gone to waste.

166
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:08,800
It would have gone lost.

167
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:12,564
So we wanted to make sure that we would still use it.

168
00:08:12,844 --> 00:08:14,185
And so it was the old one out.

169
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:16,667
And it was put into the Playroom VR.

170
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:19,470
And that was the end.

171
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:20,451
And that's it.

172
00:08:20,571 --> 00:08:21,892
And I remember that was like Christmas 2016.

173
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,522
and around that time, the holiday time, and I was in bed and I was thinking,

174
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:32,505
right, next year we're going to have to start a new project and, you know, the team should be busy

175
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:35,446
from the beginning. What are we going to do? You know, are we going to do like a bigger party game?

176
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:40,009
And really inside of myself and I think the team as well, we really wanted to make a big platformer,

177
00:08:40,069 --> 00:08:45,452
but it really felt like it's not a true VR game. And there's a bit of a trauma there, I think,

178
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:48,734
because, you know, we've heard so many times that it should be first person and virtual hands that,

179
00:08:48,754 --> 00:08:49,515
you know, it felt like a...

180
00:08:51,294 --> 00:08:53,236
And we kind of, you know, I slept on it.

181
00:08:53,757 --> 00:08:56,139
And eventually the answer actually came from the community.

182
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,616
So looking back on the net for reviews of Playroom VR,

183
00:09:00,656 --> 00:09:03,077
we came across a lot of requests, actually, from gamers.

184
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:06,859
Playroom VR kind of worked with dad and the kids

185
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,819
and playing as a family.

186
00:09:07,859 --> 00:09:10,360
But the gamers, actually, they really

187
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,062
resonated with Robo Rescue.

188
00:09:14,102 --> 00:09:15,162
And they wanted a bigger game.

189
00:09:15,743 --> 00:09:16,903
So that was the last push we needed.

190
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:17,963
And then came New Year.

191
00:09:18,364 --> 00:09:22,325
We began working on the cleverly named Super Robo Rescue.

192
00:09:23,927 --> 00:09:26,352
So that was an internal name to just make it clear to everyone.

193
00:09:26,372 --> 00:09:28,937
Yeah, we're making the big version, right?

194
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:32,204
But actually, that name stayed on for very, very, very long.

195
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:33,767
Scarily long, in fact.

196
00:09:35,296 --> 00:09:37,037
So, Robo Rescue was really cool and fun,

197
00:09:37,238 --> 00:09:38,759
but we needed a bigger game,

198
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,440
and we couldn't afford to just copy and paste

199
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,241
those 15 minutes and stretch them.

200
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:45,684
So we needed variety and lots of it.

201
00:09:45,764 --> 00:09:48,206
So we're finally hitting the meat of today's talk, really.

202
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,728
So today I'm gonna take you through 10 topics

203
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:52,870
that we focused on to make Astro Bot what it is.

204
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,071
And of course, that's not everything.

205
00:09:56,352 --> 00:09:58,214
But I think it encompasses some of the most

206
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:00,976
important elements of the game design.

207
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:02,637
All right, so let's go.

208
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:06,995
So I'm a kind of retro game fan, and if you know games

209
00:10:07,015 --> 00:10:09,236
like Castlevania or Grues and Ghosts, you know the map,

210
00:10:09,336 --> 00:10:09,936
you know the quest.

211
00:10:10,717 --> 00:10:13,217
So only we're not saving a princess, we're making a game.

212
00:10:13,257 --> 00:10:15,358
So it starts with VRness.

213
00:10:16,638 --> 00:10:24,140
So VRness, OK, it's probably the number one feature of the

214
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,881
game design, in fact, that differentiate this game from

215
00:10:27,982 --> 00:10:29,522
traditional TV games.

216
00:10:30,767 --> 00:10:33,572
So early on, we established that to realize the full potential

217
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:37,258
of VR, you have to become the only way to operate

218
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:37,919
the camera in a game.

219
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:41,525
And so we decided to continue not using the right stick

220
00:10:42,947 --> 00:10:45,711
and instead look for fun ways for you to use your body.

221
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:50,123
And that became the VRness.

222
00:10:50,143 --> 00:10:51,803
So behind that barbaric use of English,

223
00:10:51,863 --> 00:10:53,944
it's an ensemble of gameplay mechanics

224
00:10:53,964 --> 00:10:54,904
that take advantage of VR.

225
00:10:54,924 --> 00:10:57,865
So for example, perspective play that lets you see

226
00:10:57,885 --> 00:10:58,545
behind an object.

227
00:10:59,345 --> 00:11:03,647
Vertical play with big drops and gameplay

228
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:06,568
that kind of forces you to look up and down in a way.

229
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,008
360 play all around you.

230
00:11:09,048 --> 00:11:10,209
And then near and far play, which

231
00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:11,929
is playing with distances between you

232
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:12,669
and your main character.

233
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,190
So we're going to go through each one of those in detail now.

234
00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:18,210
So perspective play, so this is about leaning with your body

235
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,010
to see behind a wall, for example,

236
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,092
and that complements platforming really, really well.

237
00:11:22,252 --> 00:11:24,733
It works really well as a set with jumping around.

238
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:27,554
And so we've been using this at every opportunity

239
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,095
in every level.

240
00:11:31,136 --> 00:11:32,277
So here you can see you're leaning,

241
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:34,098
you see some coins, that's a guide.

242
00:11:34,618 --> 00:11:35,659
And then you can use it as a way

243
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,799
to surprise the user as well.

244
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:38,260
So we thought like here, you're leaning,

245
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,281
you're not seeing anything, and then the moment you lean,

246
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:42,342
you can see two enemies and you have to take them out.

247
00:11:43,334 --> 00:11:47,279
And these enemies actually, they come up from behind the wall, and that's a really useful way to create a hint.

248
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,563
Because once these enemies come from behind the wall, the next thing you want to do is like,

249
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:52,245
oh, what was behind that wall? And then you lean.

250
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,927
So you don't have to give people too much of a hint.

251
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:58,332
It's good to build it as part of the game world, really.

252
00:11:59,354 --> 00:12:00,294
Next is vertical play.

253
00:12:00,314 --> 00:12:02,496
So we made really heavy use of verticality for the levels.

254
00:12:02,576 --> 00:12:03,977
You often drop down really, really far,

255
00:12:04,237 --> 00:12:05,798
with large play areas down below.

256
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:08,960
Really far away.

257
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,182
And then the change of height is really powerful.

258
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:12,963
Using bumpers is an effective way

259
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,684
to quickly switch from the bottom to the top.

260
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:17,086
And then you can see gameplay from underneath.

261
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:19,747
This is another type of gameplay from underneath.

262
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:21,669
It's really dramatic to be able to control your character

263
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:22,770
from this angle.

264
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,591
And then, um.

265
00:12:25,852 --> 00:12:28,755
You can see here, parts of Astro are sticking out, and that's really important.

266
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:29,776
I'll touch on that later on.

267
00:12:30,156 --> 00:12:32,619
For bosses as well, you punch a boss and the boss falls down,

268
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:34,040
and that's again to create verticality.

269
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:37,924
And that's another boss attacking you from behind and then creating gameplay at the top.

270
00:12:37,984 --> 00:12:43,050
So at every opportunity, we've been thinking about ways to always verticalize the experience.

271
00:12:45,403 --> 00:12:46,624
So as you saw in the video, sometimes you

272
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:48,765
can get your view obstructed easily,

273
00:12:48,925 --> 00:12:50,726
especially when you're seeing Astro from underneath.

274
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,667
So what we've done is that we've developed platforms

275
00:12:53,727 --> 00:12:54,947
that you can see Astro through.

276
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:59,809
For example, leaves let you see the shadow or glass material.

277
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:00,689
It was really, really useful.

278
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:04,431
But also being able to have parts of Astro

279
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,151
that are sticking out.

280
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:07,952
So where the location of those platforms

281
00:13:08,532 --> 00:13:10,053
would be placed so that according

282
00:13:10,073 --> 00:13:11,874
to your physical position, you can always

283
00:13:12,034 --> 00:13:14,235
catch a glimpse of your character.

284
00:13:16,514 --> 00:13:18,575
Also, a couple more vertical uses.

285
00:13:19,116 --> 00:13:20,717
We make enemies fly up when you punch them,

286
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:21,918
and that's not by accident.

287
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,220
It's because we want the player to experience

288
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:29,344
this kind of firework moment, which is both satisfying

289
00:13:29,384 --> 00:13:30,505
but also kind of unique to VR.

290
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:31,926
And equally, some enemies sometimes

291
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:34,829
get stacked up to create that verticality.

292
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:36,971
OK, near play.

293
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,941
So in VR, getting close to your character

294
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,222
and seeing all the details is really, really powerful stuff.

295
00:13:42,262 --> 00:13:45,625
So we took every chance to create moments where Astro ends

296
00:13:45,665 --> 00:13:46,966
up nose to nose with you.

297
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:50,548
For example, like ledges that stick out very, very

298
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:51,189
close to your face.

299
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:52,130
They're really, really useful.

300
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,691
This rope was put there to create that moment.

301
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,414
This ledge here was put there so that after rescuing

302
00:13:58,454 --> 00:14:00,836
the little guy, Astro is right next to your face.

303
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,093
And underwater is really, really useful too,

304
00:14:04,113 --> 00:14:05,073
because you get 3D control.

305
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:07,614
So you can get really, really close to your character.

306
00:14:07,674 --> 00:14:09,135
Or your character can get close to you,

307
00:14:09,175 --> 00:14:10,635
and he gets stuck to your face as well.

308
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:16,096
So these nose-to-nose moments, or eye-to-eye moments,

309
00:14:16,236 --> 00:14:17,157
are really, really important.

310
00:14:17,197 --> 00:14:20,918
And so once again, we dotted them at every chance we had.

311
00:14:23,098 --> 00:14:24,699
And then the opposite is also true.

312
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,019
So sometimes we do far play.

313
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:30,950
With FarPlay, we take Astro away from the player.

314
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:33,812
And surprisingly, compared to a normal TV game,

315
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:35,813
it is totally possible to keep playing

316
00:14:35,873 --> 00:14:38,795
because of the depth perception that you get from the VR headset.

317
00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:41,576
And this section very much feels like a 2D platformer.

318
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,341
And sometimes, we just do special moments like that,

319
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,422
where we send the player really far away,

320
00:14:47,622 --> 00:14:49,803
just to have a little adventure, just to have a moment.

321
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:51,844
And there's no particular gameplay there.

322
00:14:51,864 --> 00:14:53,284
You just go to the island, and then, you know,

323
00:14:53,305 --> 00:14:55,045
with a bumper, quickly come back.

324
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,866
But once again, this is something that you couldn't do

325
00:14:56,886 --> 00:14:58,066
in a normal game, or you could do it,

326
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:59,047
but it would just be different.

327
00:14:59,587 --> 00:15:01,528
So with VR here, we're kind of separating the player,

328
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:03,328
and then bring them together again.

329
00:15:04,747 --> 00:15:07,909
So with Far Play, platforming can become a little bit difficult

330
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:10,150
because sometimes you may kind of drop down

331
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,052
without realizing at the back of the level.

332
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:17,295
So we kind of reduced the gameplay to 2D play momentarily

333
00:15:18,596 --> 00:15:21,038
and with a 2D constraint, so you could put an invisible wall

334
00:15:21,098 --> 00:15:22,979
or just like, you know, have a 2D spline.

335
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,441
And that worked.

336
00:15:26,081 --> 00:15:28,023
And you really don't notice the difference, you know,

337
00:15:28,063 --> 00:15:30,464
when you go from full 3D to kind of 2D gameplay.

338
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:32,926
And then mixing near play and far play

339
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,267
can be used as an emotional lever,

340
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:39,510
where you have the player and Astro together.

341
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:42,131
Then you separate them, and then you bring them back together.

342
00:15:42,151 --> 00:15:43,812
And then people told us that they really

343
00:15:43,832 --> 00:15:47,715
felt worried when Astro was getting away from them,

344
00:15:47,895 --> 00:15:48,775
because there was a moment, there

345
00:15:48,795 --> 00:15:50,797
was a feeling that they were kind of powerless to help him.

346
00:15:52,177 --> 00:15:54,699
So we can use that as an emotional trigger as well.

347
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,020
And finally, the 360 gameplay.

348
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,502
So these moments are the ones we prototyped a lot of them.

349
00:15:59,522 --> 00:16:00,923
But in the end, there's only one left in the game.

350
00:16:02,915 --> 00:16:07,098
They do take advantage of VR fully, but they're physically quite demanding.

351
00:16:07,138 --> 00:16:10,080
So here you can see you've gone all the way to one side, you have to turn around,

352
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,744
and then you have to finish your movement.

353
00:16:16,904 --> 00:16:17,945
You can see it from the outside.

354
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:19,566
So the guy in the middle, that's the VR player.

355
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,368
And these kind of things, they're really good.

356
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:27,573
But it largely depends on how flexible the player's body is,

357
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:29,817
and it can become quite a tiresome experience.

358
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:33,184
So we only kept one in the game, and that's the one moment

359
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:33,925
where you really get a 360.

360
00:16:35,143 --> 00:16:37,083
So that was VRness, and these were,

361
00:16:38,084 --> 00:16:39,924
we made sure that every level had at least one

362
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:43,485
of those memorable views of VRness from each category.

363
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:45,465
And it essentially means that you're making

364
00:16:45,485 --> 00:16:47,266
a physical experience out of the game.

365
00:16:47,846 --> 00:16:49,666
So a good way to know if the game has enough VRness

366
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:50,766
is simply watch people's neck.

367
00:16:51,687 --> 00:16:53,727
And if they're not moving quite enough,

368
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,968
then perhaps it means that we need to adjust the level

369
00:16:56,008 --> 00:16:58,408
to stretch the play field and create more of these moments.

370
00:16:58,428 --> 00:16:59,348
So that was the case for us.

371
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:01,389
We would watch people, and sometimes we feel like,

372
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:02,269
well, there's not enough movement.

373
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,433
Okay, so next on our quest is Astro and you

374
00:17:10,574 --> 00:17:15,859
So I could have called this physical play part two to be honest because it is an extension of the honest in many ways

375
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:18,962
But it focuses on you as a physical player in the game

376
00:17:20,183 --> 00:17:23,265
So you exist in the world you a giant robot following Astro

377
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:26,383
And seeing your body is something we really

378
00:17:26,423 --> 00:17:27,764
wanted to incorporate where possible.

379
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:31,148
So you can see your own shadow, and people really love that.

380
00:17:31,328 --> 00:17:33,251
We also look for opportunities to place TV screens

381
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:34,892
where you can see yourself and move around.

382
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:37,275
And we made a VR player body that is very stretchy,

383
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:38,837
so that moving in front of a mirror

384
00:17:39,698 --> 00:17:41,239
is a fun moment of self-performance.

385
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:47,002
And it's also an opportunity to create some kind of goofy moments where you come out of the water here,

386
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:49,765
you have a snorkel, and you have this kind of seaweed attached to your face.

387
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:52,828
So these moments are the kind of things that people remember.

388
00:17:53,629 --> 00:17:56,992
So we made sure that we put one of them every three to four levels.

389
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,895
So that is just enough to make people feel, oh yeah.

390
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:06,280
Okay, the eye contact, so that one is huge and it's a little bit linked to the previous one, the near play.

391
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:12,145
Astro looking back at you in VR, that was incredibly powerful, especially when, you know, it's a small character, quite cute.

392
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:17,169
And Astro does that a lot, like, so Astro bends in all directions to look at you at every opportunity.

393
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:18,490
He waves at you, a lot.

394
00:18:19,551 --> 00:18:20,051
Really a lot.

395
00:18:20,772 --> 00:18:26,016
And it's kind of layered on top of all the action animations, so that your control never changes.

396
00:18:26,456 --> 00:18:28,218
But even as he's jumping around, he's always looking at you.

397
00:18:31,391 --> 00:18:33,693
You'd think he's got a problem, he's just waving all the time.

398
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:38,137
But it's not just Astro, some of the NPCs as well.

399
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:41,640
So they all have big eyes, and the reason for that is because we want the world to be looking at you.

400
00:18:42,901 --> 00:18:45,344
So this big flower here mimics the movement of your body.

401
00:18:45,664 --> 00:18:48,206
When you get near, it gets near.

402
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:54,772
And so, the kind of goal is that we wanted you to be the star of that game.

403
00:18:55,412 --> 00:18:59,416
And so having all these characters turning and looking at you was really, really powerful.

404
00:19:02,104 --> 00:19:05,905
So the eye contact with Astro is really special, but particularly I think the game would never

405
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:06,625
be the same without it.

406
00:19:07,065 --> 00:19:09,126
It really validates your existence in that world as well.

407
00:19:09,746 --> 00:19:14,667
As a parental figure, so Astro is kind of small, cute, with weaknesses, and you are

408
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:15,227
the protector.

409
00:19:15,807 --> 00:19:17,728
So that makes a huge difference for normal games.

410
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:21,009
And as an anecdote, if you're playing a classic game, like say you're playing God of War,

411
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:25,310
and then you die, or creators die, you're going to be saying, hey, I'm going to die.

412
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,810
That's what you're going to be saying.

413
00:19:27,351 --> 00:19:29,672
But in AstroBot, what we realized,

414
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:31,352
people apologize to Astro.

415
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:33,053
They go, oh, little guy, I'm sorry.

416
00:19:33,713 --> 00:19:34,634
I wasn't there to help you.

417
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:36,935
Which is very strange, because it is the same relationship.

418
00:19:36,955 --> 00:19:38,336
They are controlling the guy, and they are dying.

419
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:42,017
But that's proof that they see Astro as an entity of its own,

420
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:43,578
and have a real empathy.

421
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:45,599
And that's the really powerful stuff.

422
00:19:45,639 --> 00:19:49,721
And I think it's largely carried by this look at

423
00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:52,642
and the waving, the constant waving from Astro.

424
00:19:54,622 --> 00:19:55,943
So with Playroom VR, the previous game,

425
00:19:55,983 --> 00:19:57,504
we also understood the head-butting was great.

426
00:19:57,784 --> 00:19:58,744
Really satisfying mechanic.

427
00:19:59,205 --> 00:20:02,686
So we used that to make you participate in the game.

428
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:08,329
To knock down walls, push beams, or you can push a beam

429
00:20:08,369 --> 00:20:09,890
and then that creates a path for Astro.

430
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:16,091
And headbutting is one of those mechanics that is really like small input but big output.

431
00:20:16,171 --> 00:20:17,012
So it's very satisfying.

432
00:20:17,192 --> 00:20:19,314
Here you have an entire section of a level coming up.

433
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:21,676
And you can also take it further.

434
00:20:21,716 --> 00:20:23,518
So we kind of turned that into a mini game.

435
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:26,380
There are some kind of VR soccer games like that.

436
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,463
So that was interesting to put that inside some of the levels.

437
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,810
And equally, dodging, that's something we've reused from Playroom VR.

438
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,272
I mean, you know, of course in VR we all know like, you know, that's kind of Zed.

439
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:40,172
Kind of dodging stuff feels really good.

440
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:44,494
Um, we use that in the bosses, we use that for traps.

441
00:20:44,554 --> 00:20:49,396
So here the boss is kind of sending some, you know, like feathers and stuff like that.

442
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:49,536
Um...

443
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,350
So dodging became a key mechanic as well that we used in many situations.

444
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,311
And then we started combining it with the headbutting.

445
00:20:56,331 --> 00:20:58,891
So here you're dodging, you're dodging, and then at the end you're headbutting.

446
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,532
And you can have this kind of moment.

447
00:21:02,092 --> 00:21:03,912
That's another enemy in the game, it's a wasp enemy.

448
00:21:03,992 --> 00:21:07,373
You're kind of dodging, and then that exposes a weak point, and then you can headbutt.

449
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:12,494
And as for penalty, so if you miss your dodge,

450
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:15,415
we used to have actually health in the game.

451
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:19,957
And you could actually game over based on your physical damage.

452
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:21,119
But then it was too complicated.

453
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:24,302
You had Astro's health, your health.

454
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:27,466
So in the end, we just went for visibility penalty.

455
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:31,210
So your vision gets impaired, and then that

456
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,071
puts Astro at risk.

457
00:21:33,051 --> 00:21:36,333
We also used the PSVR microphone to create a few blowing mechanics.

458
00:21:36,593 --> 00:21:39,475
So we found it difficult to create really rich gameplay because it can be triggered,

459
00:21:39,855 --> 00:21:41,836
it can be actually turned off by the user as well.

460
00:21:42,817 --> 00:21:45,159
But we used in light, small magical touches.

461
00:21:45,699 --> 00:21:47,820
And there's no real way to fail these ones.

462
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:50,842
And people, you know, some people who noticed it,

463
00:21:50,862 --> 00:21:52,463
they were really, really blown away by that.

464
00:21:53,243 --> 00:21:54,984
And so, for example, underwater you have some bubbles,

465
00:21:55,284 --> 00:21:58,066
and that was a funny, so I had a personal anecdote.

466
00:21:58,106 --> 00:22:00,587
My brother calls me and he tells me he's playing Astro Bot

467
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:01,207
and he was really cool.

468
00:22:01,287 --> 00:22:03,769
I had a cold, and every time I was underwater,

469
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,549
I was coughing, I could see bubbles coming out.

470
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,051
And it's kind of nice because a lot of people

471
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:11,713
actually don't know there's a microphone in a headset.

472
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:13,714
So when you use it, it's always a little bit magical,

473
00:22:13,734 --> 00:22:16,555
you know, it's like, it's a good one to use, I think.

474
00:22:17,911 --> 00:22:19,052
And then, of course, 3D audio.

475
00:22:19,092 --> 00:22:22,035
So it's hard to tell from this video,

476
00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:24,678
but basically we use 3D audio as a way

477
00:22:24,698 --> 00:22:26,100
to locate these missing robots.

478
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,282
So right now, there's one at the very top left,

479
00:22:28,382 --> 00:22:32,747
and you can hear it through the 3D audio.

480
00:22:32,947 --> 00:22:35,730
And in the end, it works well, but it

481
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,151
requires a lot of balancing between.

482
00:22:38,452 --> 00:22:41,434
uh... the environment, the music, and

483
00:22:42,114 --> 00:22:45,836
sometimes, you know, a character that is really far away cannot be heard because of the

484
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:49,777
distance, so we had to kind of cheat and increase the volume and vice versa. When he's too close to you,

485
00:22:49,797 --> 00:22:51,998
we've had to reduce the volume. So it's a case-by-case basis.

486
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:56,600
And there are 220 of them in the game to rescue, so he was actually a very

487
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,841
important core mechanic of the game.

488
00:23:01,022 --> 00:23:02,322
We're making good progress there.

489
00:23:02,482 --> 00:23:02,983
Controller use.

490
00:23:04,685 --> 00:23:06,346
So we used the DualShock 4 for this game,

491
00:23:06,406 --> 00:23:09,507
and we stuck with DualShock 4 because it is perfect for us.

492
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:12,248
It's trackable, but also it has an analog stick.

493
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:14,509
And the button alignment was perfect for jumping

494
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:16,169
and punching for these kind of platform games.

495
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:18,610
And the controls are super simple on purpose.

496
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:23,691
We thought that the VR would be what would add richness.

497
00:23:24,332 --> 00:23:26,032
So the control scheme could be very, very simple.

498
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:29,033
The richness of the game should come from everything

499
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:29,413
to do with VR.

500
00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:34,401
We also inflated the size at 1.1, sorry, 1.2.1.

501
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:36,862
The size was really, it was correct, but it felt small.

502
00:23:37,522 --> 00:23:39,323
So of course it's a matter of IPD as well,

503
00:23:39,363 --> 00:23:41,204
but not just that, it's also a matter of perception.

504
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:43,365
So we inflated the controller to 1.3.

505
00:23:43,665 --> 00:23:46,347
It felt nice and chunky in your hands,

506
00:23:46,427 --> 00:23:47,667
and that's what we did.

507
00:23:49,508 --> 00:23:52,270
Also, the guns are, the gadgets are effectively guns.

508
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,371
So there's a bunch of gadgets coming out of the controller.

509
00:23:56,072 --> 00:23:58,895
We imagine that people are sitting on the sofa in a very relaxed way,

510
00:23:58,935 --> 00:24:02,319
and we don't want them to have this kind of very physical, hard physical effort.

511
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:04,981
So we made all the gadgets, effectively,

512
00:24:05,762 --> 00:24:10,267
guns that you can shoot from your default kind of position.

513
00:24:11,963 --> 00:24:15,805
and even the rope which is a physical object stretches so basically everything is kind of stretchy

514
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:19,086
and the targeting is very very loose, very generous

515
00:24:19,106 --> 00:24:22,708
you can see that's the big circle there, that's the actually hookshot attach

516
00:24:24,769 --> 00:24:26,210
kind of detection zone

517
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:27,770
and the same thing for the shuriken

518
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,831
so the shuriken here, there's a little marker

519
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:31,492
the user doesn't see that, that's for debug

520
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:34,474
but basically we make a very very generous auto aiming

521
00:24:34,694 --> 00:24:39,816
so that, you know, it's much more satisfying to play that way

522
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,701
Also, all the gadgets work as a complement to platforming.

523
00:24:45,741 --> 00:24:47,742
So that sounds obvious, it's a platform game,

524
00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:49,903
but actually we had to remind ourselves that

525
00:24:50,043 --> 00:24:51,304
the gadget should be there to support

526
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:53,824
the core of the gameplay, which is jumping around.

527
00:24:53,905 --> 00:24:57,626
So here you can see how the shurikens are used

528
00:24:58,326 --> 00:24:59,407
as a way to make a platform.

529
00:25:00,907 --> 00:25:02,488
And here is the water gadget,

530
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:09,090
also used as a way to make platforms for Astro.

531
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,451
So always as a complement to platforming.

532
00:25:13,015 --> 00:25:15,976
And that's really interesting because it creates a kind of turn-based approach

533
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:18,697
whereby you have this kind of first-person interaction with the controllers

534
00:25:19,197 --> 00:25:21,137
and then you have some jumping, jumping, jumping around.

535
00:25:21,217 --> 00:25:22,758
First-person interaction, jumping, jumping.

536
00:25:22,818 --> 00:25:25,639
And this kind of tempo, this choreography between your...

537
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:28,319
you know, the first person and third person actually

538
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:31,220
ended up being a very important point of the way we were judging

539
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:32,580
the tempo of the level.

540
00:25:35,204 --> 00:25:36,705
And so those gadgets, to qualify it,

541
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,708
how do we actually go about them, we brainstormed.

542
00:25:40,008 --> 00:25:42,050
And then to qualify, the gadget needs

543
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:43,031
to have several use cases.

544
00:25:43,091 --> 00:25:45,193
So we wanted a kind of multi-layered gameplay.

545
00:25:45,593 --> 00:25:47,135
For example, the water gadget had something

546
00:25:47,155 --> 00:25:49,717
like 10 use cases, ranging from making platforms,

547
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:51,899
defeating enemies, but also having this kind

548
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,660
of toy-like usages as well.

549
00:25:55,423 --> 00:25:58,346
So the gadget section, they're generally scripted inside the level.

550
00:25:58,386 --> 00:25:59,506
It's quite a specific location.

551
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:01,788
However, within those predefined sections,

552
00:26:01,848 --> 00:26:03,149
there is room for self-expression.

553
00:26:03,189 --> 00:26:05,110
So example here, the player is playing it safe.

554
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:08,092
You can pull all the platforms one by one.

555
00:26:08,973 --> 00:26:10,434
But we made sure there was also some ways

556
00:26:10,474 --> 00:26:12,696
to kind of use the gadget in a skillful way.

557
00:26:12,716 --> 00:26:15,458
So here you can tug on a rope to send asteroid.

558
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:20,481
And equally, this is a shuriken, so you can play really safe.

559
00:26:20,501 --> 00:26:24,323
You can make like a very, very, you know, safe path with small germs.

560
00:26:25,644 --> 00:26:27,765
Or you can go for a kind of more risky approach.

561
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:32,868
So, we also made sure that the gadgets kind of have this kind of dual, dual, you know,

562
00:26:32,948 --> 00:26:36,070
couple levels of, of, of skill, really.

563
00:26:38,475 --> 00:26:42,516
Right, earlier I mentioned the gadgets were all like, you know, remote guns but I've allied

564
00:26:42,596 --> 00:26:46,877
because one of them is actually based on 3D position and that's the way where you plug

565
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:51,898
the controller inside this door to activate, you know, like for example a door or a chest.

566
00:26:52,518 --> 00:26:56,299
That's how you get a gadget, you plug the controller inside the chest, the chest opens

567
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,619
and then you get the gadget.

568
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:00,720
But even for that, in order to help the comfort...

569
00:27:03,078 --> 00:27:07,260
we actually created, we made the chest a floating object

570
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,762
so that the chest is always at arm's length from you,

571
00:27:11,762 --> 00:27:17,225
which is 18 inches away from you and 10 inches up.

572
00:27:18,145 --> 00:27:20,846
Yeah, 47 centimeters, 26 centimeters.

573
00:27:20,886 --> 00:27:23,907
So when you move back, the chest moves towards you.

574
00:27:23,947 --> 00:27:25,548
When you move forward, the chest moves away from you

575
00:27:25,588 --> 00:27:26,989
so that whether you're an adult or kids,

576
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:29,130
you can easily click your controller inside.

577
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:41,678
One-to-one, so this is something we did in terms of just having the controller reacting to one-to-one with the inputs, so you can see like the stick or the buttons.

578
00:27:42,478 --> 00:27:43,379
And that feels really, really good.

579
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,482
So we can spend a little bit of time on that.

580
00:27:47,822 --> 00:27:51,185
On the touchpad, when you're using the Shuriken, here I'm sliding the Shuriken really slowly.

581
00:27:52,906 --> 00:27:56,088
And that feels really good as well, to have this kind of one-to-one feedback.

582
00:27:57,339 --> 00:27:58,720
It's a small thing, but I think it matters.

583
00:27:59,821 --> 00:28:00,342
Buttons guide.

584
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:03,004
We change the layout of the controller

585
00:28:03,044 --> 00:28:03,945
depending on the situation.

586
00:28:04,005 --> 00:28:07,228
For example, we show only circle and cross in the menu,

587
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:09,090
because they're the two buttons that you use to navigate.

588
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:11,372
Once you enter the game, the buttons actually shut down,

589
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:13,093
and the new button, active buttons, come up.

590
00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:16,114
so that in the game you're using square and cross,

591
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:19,115
which are your punch and jump buttons.

592
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:20,555
And that's really nice actually,

593
00:28:20,595 --> 00:28:22,375
because it means that you can actually make do with,

594
00:28:22,475 --> 00:28:24,336
you know, you can get rid of tutorials in a way,

595
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:26,056
because you don't have to remind the player

596
00:28:26,076 --> 00:28:27,096
which buttons to use,

597
00:28:27,396 --> 00:28:29,497
they're just the ones that he can see on the controller.

598
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:34,178
All right, so that was controller.

599
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:36,938
And next are the wah moments.

600
00:28:38,318 --> 00:28:38,498
Okay.

601
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:42,952
So one level, one adventure, that

602
00:28:42,992 --> 00:28:44,972
was a kind of idea for this.

603
00:28:45,152 --> 00:28:47,973
And we ensured that every level introduced a unique theme

604
00:28:48,013 --> 00:28:48,834
to be remembered by.

605
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:52,015
So the beach, giant in the sky, high rise, ninja castle,

606
00:28:52,615 --> 00:28:53,135
graveyard.

607
00:28:53,575 --> 00:28:55,436
And these were often inspired by pop culture.

608
00:28:56,436 --> 00:28:58,357
For example, there is a level inside a whale,

609
00:28:58,397 --> 00:28:59,177
and that's Pinocchio.

610
00:28:59,397 --> 00:29:01,297
There's a level inside a cave with traps,

611
00:29:01,337 --> 00:29:02,098
that's Indiana Jones.

612
00:29:02,978 --> 00:29:05,899
So of course, we did reuse elements from level to level.

613
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:08,540
But we changed the colors, the lighting, the vegetation,

614
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,220
so it never felt like the same location twice.

615
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,632
And well, there is an expense to that, of course,

616
00:29:13,932 --> 00:29:15,133
making everything a little bit unique.

617
00:29:15,793 --> 00:29:17,674
But in the end, we thought it was better

618
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,254
to have eight hours of fresh gameplay

619
00:29:20,274 --> 00:29:23,135
rather than 15 hours of recycling.

620
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:26,456
So each level has one big warm moment in the middle.

621
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:29,117
So it could be as simple as a big jumbo jet

622
00:29:29,157 --> 00:29:29,738
flying above you.

623
00:29:29,838 --> 00:29:30,998
Usually it's something big, right?

624
00:29:31,078 --> 00:29:33,459
So a boss, for example, would come as a preview

625
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:35,980
because we have those models, so we might as well use them.

626
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,901
A big NPC would come and help you.

627
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:45,166
you know, make your... to travel through the level.

628
00:29:45,726 --> 00:29:49,190
Here we have a vertical moment where, you know, you kind of fall down with Astro

629
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,873
to the cave and continue. Here we have a vertical moment where you

630
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:56,337
use your gadget to create the rest of the level

631
00:29:56,517 --> 00:29:58,519
and then at some point you get eaten by a whale.

632
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,403
And then you're inside the whale, you know, playing on his waves.

633
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:08,613
with these kind of big waves becoming part of the terrain.

634
00:30:09,194 --> 00:30:11,276
And then there's the jumbo jet recycled inside the storm,

635
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:13,679
so you're kind of stuck inside the storm, like Twister style.

636
00:30:13,699 --> 00:30:16,302
So every level had this kind of big, big wow moment.

637
00:30:16,902 --> 00:30:18,384
But also every level finished on a high.

638
00:30:19,602 --> 00:30:22,023
With something with surprise and humor,

639
00:30:22,624 --> 00:30:24,245
that kind of links back to the playfulness

640
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:27,086
that we always want to inject.

641
00:30:27,847 --> 00:30:30,869
So the idea was to make it so that the goals

642
00:30:30,909 --> 00:30:32,029
would never be too predictable.

643
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,931
So when the goals appear, you know, it's always.

644
00:30:35,212 --> 00:30:37,213
And here you have, that's the whale level, for example.

645
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:38,153
At the end, you find the goal,

646
00:30:38,193 --> 00:30:40,395
but at the end you get ejected by the whale.

647
00:30:41,335 --> 00:30:42,816
And you have that vertical moment as well.

648
00:30:42,856 --> 00:30:44,838
So it's a way to really combine lots of things together.

649
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,890
Yeah, and then you have the end of the level.

650
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,051
OK, and then, of course, the bosses.

651
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:53,351
So the bosses, these are the big moments of the game.

652
00:30:53,391 --> 00:30:55,412
And we wanted the bosses to be really huge.

653
00:30:55,552 --> 00:30:57,232
There was no bosses in Robot Rescues.

654
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,773
That was the first time we could get it.

655
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:02,253
And so often, the designers would do a test,

656
00:31:02,313 --> 00:31:03,874
and we would go, no, bigger.

657
00:31:04,814 --> 00:31:06,054
So the size was really important.

658
00:31:06,294 --> 00:31:07,014
That's not Astro.

659
00:31:07,034 --> 00:31:08,515
And that's you, the VR player.

660
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,855
Astro is that little guy on the floor that you often don't see.

661
00:31:12,016 --> 00:31:13,836
Yeah, that's Shark Boss, and then that's the final boss.

662
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:19,150
So talking about scale, so how big is it for a boss?

663
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,671
Well, if the VR player is at scale 1,

664
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:25,812
Astro is at scale 0.2, and the bosses are 20.

665
00:31:27,032 --> 00:31:32,413
So 100 times the size of Astro, and more or less 20 times

666
00:31:33,114 --> 00:31:35,734
the size of the VR player.

667
00:31:37,475 --> 00:31:38,835
So that was for the kind of wow moments

668
00:31:38,935 --> 00:31:39,855
that we wanted to have in.

669
00:31:39,915 --> 00:31:41,275
And then something that is linked to that

670
00:31:41,315 --> 00:31:42,016
is the dual scale.

671
00:31:44,162 --> 00:31:45,063
Let me explain that one.

672
00:31:45,163 --> 00:31:48,226
So since both you and Astro share the same space,

673
00:31:48,346 --> 00:31:51,308
it is necessary to create levels that work on both scales.

674
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:54,311
Because Astro is miniature, but you are human size.

675
00:31:55,052 --> 00:31:56,193
So when you look down, you can see

676
00:31:56,213 --> 00:31:57,634
a level that feels like a miniature level

677
00:31:57,694 --> 00:32:00,997
with distances and spacing that is built for platforming.

678
00:32:01,757 --> 00:32:04,680
But when you look up, you see a giant world

679
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:07,442
that has been designed to be a VR ride for you, the VR player.

680
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:10,205
And this two-scale approach was adopted for all stages,

681
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:12,166
and it kind of informed the themes we'd pick.

682
00:32:12,707 --> 00:32:14,248
Some themes would really lend themselves to that.

683
00:32:14,288 --> 00:32:16,510
Some themes would only work for one or two scales,

684
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:18,512
so we would kind of not do it.

685
00:32:18,532 --> 00:32:22,376
Then there's also the enemy scales.

686
00:32:22,396 --> 00:32:23,617
So they come in two sizes.

687
00:32:24,397 --> 00:32:25,839
There's the small enemies that are designed

688
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:26,559
for astral scales.

689
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:28,161
They are defeated by punching or jumping.

690
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:31,591
And there's a whole roster of kind of

691
00:32:31,971 --> 00:32:38,236
Giant enemies that are there to attack you the VR player and these are normally defeated with physical actions like head-butting or using the

692
00:32:39,037 --> 00:32:41,099
gadgets for first first-person gameplay

693
00:32:43,521 --> 00:32:48,925
But also the bosses had that dual scale design and you know for the wild purpose we we made some massive bosses

694
00:32:48,985 --> 00:32:53,089
But then the problem we have is that we have to create gameplay with them and the gameplay mostly come from astral

695
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:54,170
you know punching around so

696
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,531
We had to create some small parts,

697
00:32:56,872 --> 00:32:58,153
or we had to think about the small parts

698
00:32:58,173 --> 00:32:59,294
that would work on Astro's level.

699
00:32:59,314 --> 00:32:59,995
So here's the tooth.

700
00:33:01,456 --> 00:33:03,578
And so the tooth is, roughly speaking,

701
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:05,199
the size of Astro, so it's perfect.

702
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,142
And then you take over and have the kind of

703
00:33:08,482 --> 00:33:09,603
big scale kind of gameplay.

704
00:33:12,245 --> 00:33:13,166
Same thing with the final boss,

705
00:33:13,326 --> 00:33:15,749
the hand and the fingers felt like a good thing

706
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:16,930
for Astro to punch.

707
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:21,565
And then, you know, you take over and you have this kind of, you know, large scale.

708
00:33:23,165 --> 00:33:27,086
And when we didn't have this luxury of...

709
00:33:27,447 --> 00:33:30,427
we used small enemies that are kind of baby versions of the bosses.

710
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:32,008
So they're kind of an extension of the boss.

711
00:33:33,268 --> 00:33:34,709
So here you have, like, the S&M spider

712
00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:36,529
and she's got these kind of little babies and stuff.

713
00:33:36,569 --> 00:33:37,069
Anyway.

714
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:41,250
We're going to come back to that lady later on, actually.

715
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:41,490
Right.

716
00:33:42,371 --> 00:33:43,471
So then, fun VR world.

717
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,199
Just taking the time, I think we're good.

718
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,041
So as a VR player, you are inside a cartoon.

719
00:33:51,521 --> 00:33:54,823
And so we wanted people to feel, regardless of the gameplay,

720
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:57,904
this is all about you being in the VR magical world.

721
00:33:58,524 --> 00:34:00,265
So we filled it with stories that

722
00:34:00,285 --> 00:34:02,706
are happening all around you to immerse and amaze you.

723
00:34:03,707 --> 00:34:07,050
And as much as possible, we also made them kind of lighthearted and, you know, funny.

724
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:11,314
For example, here, there's like a vulture sticking, you know, stealing a cow and you kind of...

725
00:34:12,055 --> 00:34:14,297
And these little guys that you rescued, these 220 guys,

726
00:34:14,317 --> 00:34:16,859
they proved to be a great way to make funny dioramas.

727
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,802
So as well as the pleasure of finding a character to save,

728
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:23,045
you know, you get a satisfaction of a fun little story.

729
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:24,567
Yeah.

730
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:28,871
And for example, that dude, yeah, he didn't make it.

731
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:31,190
Yeah, so these are kind of little things we doted around,

732
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,190
you know, to, to, to, it should be just fun

733
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,310
to just walk through these levels.

734
00:34:35,831 --> 00:34:37,491
But also, we wanted a living world.

735
00:34:37,511 --> 00:34:39,451
So this is something that exists in every game

736
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:40,592
or should exist in every game,

737
00:34:40,772 --> 00:34:42,772
but I think in VR, it's that much more important,

738
00:34:43,432 --> 00:34:46,113
and that's having a world that is completely, like, reactive.

739
00:34:46,233 --> 00:34:49,254
So everything reacts to you and Astro's presence.

740
00:34:50,074 --> 00:34:53,195
So every object in the game, we added some dynamic properties

741
00:34:53,255 --> 00:34:56,195
so that you could punch them, and they would react.

742
00:34:56,235 --> 00:34:58,156
Even platforms would kind of, you know, bob slightly

743
00:34:58,216 --> 00:34:58,856
when you jump on them.

744
00:34:59,878 --> 00:35:04,387
And sometimes we link that to a more kind of like full screen or kind of large scale effect.

745
00:35:04,407 --> 00:35:06,110
So Astro here is triggering some fireflies.

746
00:35:06,531 --> 00:35:08,175
And that's for your benefit as a VR player.

747
00:35:08,235 --> 00:35:10,680
It's all around you and you get that kind of, you know, moment.

748
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:14,028
This is for you, my friends.

749
00:35:14,348 --> 00:35:15,869
A little heart.

750
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,570
Right.

751
00:35:17,911 --> 00:35:18,791
The same thing with the gadgets.

752
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:21,794
So we have the same philosophy, where the gadgets should be toys.

753
00:35:22,634 --> 00:35:24,696
So beside their functional use,

754
00:35:25,616 --> 00:35:27,418
for example, like you shoot enemies, they react.

755
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,699
If you shoot an electric enemy, you electrify yourself.

756
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,742
Even the guys you rescue, you can be mean to them.

757
00:35:33,342 --> 00:35:35,684
And even Astro. Here, you're on an elevator going to the boss,

758
00:35:35,724 --> 00:35:38,126
and you can just, you know, be mean to Astro.

759
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:45,558
You can also beam into yourself, you can splash yourself in the face, and you can even shuriken your own face.

760
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,940
Yeah, and you break the headset.

761
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,900
So it's kind of funny.

762
00:35:51,621 --> 00:35:53,341
Yeah, this is stuff we did at the end of a project.

763
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:55,142
We really reserved some time to really do

764
00:35:55,262 --> 00:35:56,142
all of these little things,

765
00:35:56,202 --> 00:35:58,382
because they're the ones that come out in the review,

766
00:35:58,482 --> 00:35:59,283
actually, in the reviews.

767
00:35:59,363 --> 00:36:00,983
People go, oh, I tried that, and I tried that,

768
00:36:01,483 --> 00:36:02,804
and it did this and that, so yeah.

769
00:36:03,904 --> 00:36:06,605
Equally, the bosses have like a fun finished treatment,

770
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:09,065
and it's usually tied to gadgets and VRness.

771
00:36:09,165 --> 00:36:10,446
So for example, here you have the octopus.

772
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:12,066
You fill up the octopus with water.

773
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:13,987
He gets really, really big,

774
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:15,547
and at the end you get a verticality moment.

775
00:36:16,287 --> 00:36:18,410
Yeah, yeah.

776
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,253
That's the spider, so you finish off the spider,

777
00:36:20,293 --> 00:36:23,517
and then you have to use the gadget to crack a corset open.

778
00:36:26,261 --> 00:36:26,421
Yeah.

779
00:36:28,624 --> 00:36:30,387
And if you look away as you're doing it,

780
00:36:30,447 --> 00:36:31,929
you get a trophy for being a gentleman.

781
00:36:36,413 --> 00:36:39,035
Right, so that's the kind of playfulness and humor side.

782
00:36:39,555 --> 00:36:41,756
Next, this is about platforming fundamentals.

783
00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:43,978
So we are making a VR game with lots of VRness

784
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:45,659
and lots of VR tricks, but really,

785
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:49,561
like every good platformer, we need some really solid controls.

786
00:36:50,281 --> 00:36:52,363
And that's an area that we worked on from Robo Rescue,

787
00:36:52,383 --> 00:36:54,804
and we kept refining it throughout Astro Bot.

788
00:36:54,844 --> 00:36:57,026
So the character weight, inertia, acceleration,

789
00:36:58,046 --> 00:36:59,727
the way every action can be chained together,

790
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:02,089
the way the animations and the inputs

791
00:37:02,129 --> 00:37:03,590
are kind of like, you know, so blending.

792
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,993
All of these states work together in harmony, and that was really important

793
00:37:10,774 --> 00:37:14,196
to create a smooth game. So even if you were to play it on the TV, you should feel the same way.

794
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:19,083
But we've had to adapt the controls a little bit.

795
00:37:19,424 --> 00:37:20,905
We've had to refine them.

796
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:22,226
So for example, here, if you look,

797
00:37:22,246 --> 00:37:25,728
I'm pushing up on the left stick continuously.

798
00:37:25,908 --> 00:37:27,789
But I'm looking left and right as I'm running along.

799
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:30,211
And so Astro is adjusting his course, actually,

800
00:37:31,412 --> 00:37:32,292
according to where I'm looking.

801
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,914
So of course, a lot of games do that also with the right stick.

802
00:37:34,974 --> 00:37:39,537
But here, we're talking about really very, very

803
00:37:39,597 --> 00:37:40,578
brutal camera movement.

804
00:37:40,598 --> 00:37:42,760
For example, here in this section, I'm going to go down.

805
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:46,811
So all the controls are now mapped to be, you know, from that point of view.

806
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:50,695
Then I go up and then the controls are kind of remapped in real time.

807
00:37:50,715 --> 00:37:53,278
So it's like we've had to spend quite a lot of time actually.

808
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:59,477
getting rid of all the cases where you felt like you're trying to go in a straight line

809
00:37:59,517 --> 00:38:06,959
and basically you'd go in a zig-zag, because your angle of view would be a little bit strange.

810
00:38:07,399 --> 00:38:10,220
And so in the end, you're able to control Astro even looking away.

811
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:14,781
So that took quite some time to implement.

812
00:38:16,322 --> 00:38:20,925
But a big one, actually, is about being able to judge your 3D position.

813
00:38:22,006 --> 00:38:27,850
And so we use these lasers under Astro's boots to actually give you an extra hint of where

814
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,131
you are in relation to the ground.

815
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:34,375
And this is, this became really, really, really useful, especially in low visibility.

816
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:38,237
So for example, here you're playing from underneath, and all you have is a shadow, but having the

817
00:38:38,257 --> 00:38:41,120
lasers to really judge where you're going to land on each platform.

818
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,983
Plus the fact it's hovering, so you have an extra time actually during those sections.

819
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:46,564
That's really, really useful.

820
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:53,070
Another thing we did, something that many traditional games do, but it was the first

821
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,752
for us, it was about the teetering.

822
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,234
So when a location is safe to drop from.

823
00:38:58,471 --> 00:38:59,272
you can just drop down.

824
00:38:59,432 --> 00:39:01,013
But when a location is unsafe

825
00:39:01,434 --> 00:39:03,255
or is going to have a big-time penalty,

826
00:39:03,616 --> 00:39:04,597
we've added a teetering,

827
00:39:05,257 --> 00:39:06,358
and this is something the game designers

828
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:08,580
can just add to a ledge.

829
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:10,742
And you can override the teetering by jumping.

830
00:39:12,043 --> 00:39:14,245
Without it, the game is really frustrating to play.

831
00:39:14,666 --> 00:39:15,407
You fall down a lot.

832
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:17,368
So depending on the situation,

833
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,610
we added this teetering.

834
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:21,152
And of course, everything else

835
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:22,613
that has to go in the real game,

836
00:39:22,793 --> 00:39:23,734
I really hate that term,

837
00:39:23,774 --> 00:39:24,775
but it's like, you know, that...

838
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:27,998
he felt working on a VR game, you know, let's be a real game.

839
00:39:28,518 --> 00:39:33,782
So enemies, pickups, collectibles, a progression system based on collectibles,

840
00:39:34,763 --> 00:39:38,105
challenge so that, you know, the very, very skillful players have something like to get

841
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,628
their teeth into, a collection room, and of course, soundtrack, you know,

842
00:39:41,648 --> 00:39:42,689
that goes with a good action game.

843
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,741
That's from Kenny Young, who is not here anymore.

844
00:39:47,841 --> 00:39:48,521
But, yeah.

845
00:39:49,122 --> 00:39:49,262
Um...

846
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:51,183
No, he's still alive.

847
00:39:51,243 --> 00:39:52,063
He's just left the room.

848
00:39:52,243 --> 00:39:53,224
He was there at the beginning.

849
00:39:53,244 --> 00:39:53,444
He's...

850
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:54,364
So...

851
00:39:56,366 --> 00:39:56,546
Yes.

852
00:39:57,866 --> 00:39:58,006
Um...

853
00:39:58,607 --> 00:39:58,947
Comfort.

854
00:39:59,087 --> 00:40:01,228
So that's really important for VR games.

855
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:04,830
Actually, in Astro Bot, the levels are perfectly straight.

856
00:40:05,391 --> 00:40:08,612
So the start point and the end point are perfectly aligned.

857
00:40:08,752 --> 00:40:09,573
You go in a straight line.

858
00:40:10,093 --> 00:40:10,173
Choo!

859
00:40:11,034 --> 00:40:13,516
But it's actually astral that goes left, right, up, and down.

860
00:40:13,736 --> 00:40:16,158
So the levels are built to be twisting around you.

861
00:40:16,378 --> 00:40:18,200
And at the end of the level, if you ask somebody,

862
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,202
how did you feel that you went, they

863
00:40:20,222 --> 00:40:22,284
will tell you I've gone up and down and left and right.

864
00:40:22,324 --> 00:40:24,826
But in fact, your body has gone in a straight line.

865
00:40:26,247 --> 00:40:28,048
Apart from vertical level, but even vertical level

866
00:40:28,068 --> 00:40:29,570
go in a straight line, but just upwards.

867
00:40:30,691 --> 00:40:34,154
And so that was really important to agree on this

868
00:40:34,394 --> 00:40:35,535
and to stick to it.

869
00:40:37,196 --> 00:40:38,377
Also, there is an invisible leash.

870
00:40:40,213 --> 00:40:42,254
This is how we kind of go around doing traversal.

871
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:43,955
That was back in Robot Rescue as well.

872
00:40:43,975 --> 00:40:46,416
So there is an invisible line, if you like,

873
00:40:46,456 --> 00:40:47,637
and it's slightly curved outwards.

874
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:50,498
And if Astro crosses that line, you move with him.

875
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,360
It feels strange at first, because you

876
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,800
have no reference point.

877
00:40:56,341 --> 00:40:57,901
But over time, in your brain, you

878
00:40:57,921 --> 00:41:00,783
get this print of exactly where that invisible line is.

879
00:41:01,363 --> 00:41:03,024
And when you start moving, you know that you're moving.

880
00:41:03,084 --> 00:41:05,525
And so therefore, you become in control of the movement.

881
00:41:05,565 --> 00:41:07,606
And therefore, the sickness really kind of seems to go away.

882
00:41:08,326 --> 00:41:13,908
Now the important part is to really be consistent, and so that distance and that speed were never changed.

883
00:41:14,448 --> 00:41:15,648
We were not allowed to change the speed.

884
00:41:15,688 --> 00:41:20,950
So, it's 1.1 meters away from you in terms of distance, and 1 meter per second in terms of speed.

885
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:24,071
And the 1 meter per second, so I've been talking to the gameplay programmer,

886
00:41:24,571 --> 00:41:28,632
it's not a random thing that he just decided like that, actually, we went back and forth quite a lot.

887
00:41:28,772 --> 00:41:31,633
And in the end it ended up being 1 meter per second, so it's easy to remember.

888
00:41:33,014 --> 00:41:33,614
But, yeah.

889
00:41:34,474 --> 00:41:37,755
And that distance, because it's always the same, you know when you're going to be moving.

890
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:42,591
There is one time where we break that rule,

891
00:41:43,051 --> 00:41:44,792
and we have something called a stopper.

892
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:47,413
So sometimes we don't want to follow Astro,

893
00:41:47,513 --> 00:41:51,274
we want to have some gap between Astro and the player,

894
00:41:51,734 --> 00:41:54,255
so that you have a big space to play inside of.

895
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:57,716
So we've developed a system which is called a stopper.

896
00:41:57,856 --> 00:41:58,516
It's very simple.

897
00:41:58,676 --> 00:41:59,937
You enter a zone which is a stop,

898
00:41:59,997 --> 00:42:01,737
and there is a zone which is a kind of unlock.

899
00:42:02,078 --> 00:42:02,858
This goes on.

900
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:05,819
So for as long as you're inside that zone,

901
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:06,599
you're not moving forward.

902
00:42:08,973 --> 00:42:12,100
And as soon as Astro passes that trigger point.

903
00:42:13,535 --> 00:42:14,476
then you move together again.

904
00:42:15,697 --> 00:42:17,198
Now the trick is to put that trigger point

905
00:42:17,678 --> 00:42:19,780
within the 1.1 meter that we talked about earlier,

906
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,361
so that when you move together again,

907
00:42:21,401 --> 00:42:23,662
there isn't a need for catching up quickly

908
00:42:23,702 --> 00:42:24,983
and making you feel sick.

909
00:42:26,584 --> 00:42:27,885
It's a simple thing, but actually it means

910
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:30,026
that you can create a big space,

911
00:42:30,086 --> 00:42:31,307
and especially when you have gadget play

912
00:42:31,347 --> 00:42:34,469
and you want a lot of space for shooting, for example,

913
00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:37,251
you have a stopper, Astro is far away from you,

914
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:38,152
you're kind of shooting around,

915
00:42:38,232 --> 00:42:39,653
and then you make Astro come back close to you

916
00:42:39,713 --> 00:42:40,513
and you move together again.

917
00:42:44,794 --> 00:42:46,035
Next is the no going back.

918
00:42:46,075 --> 00:42:47,615
So this is something we had in Robo Rescue

919
00:42:47,655 --> 00:42:48,776
and we removed from AstroBot.

920
00:42:48,896 --> 00:42:50,817
We found that people were feeling sick

921
00:42:51,037 --> 00:42:51,957
when going backwards.

922
00:42:53,137 --> 00:42:54,578
And so we made it impossible to go backwards.

923
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:56,939
Astro can go backwards, obviously.

924
00:42:58,392 --> 00:43:01,934
And so Astro is able to go back all the way to the beginning of the level and he gets really, really, really tiny.

925
00:43:02,574 --> 00:43:03,134
But you don't move.

926
00:43:04,195 --> 00:43:08,196
And in the end, it's really not the best solution, but what we thought is that

927
00:43:09,137 --> 00:43:12,218
we just created levels that minimized the motivation for going backwards.

928
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,879
So as much as possible, we make it so that, you know,

929
00:43:15,299 --> 00:43:18,100
we could have made the level destroyed behind you, but that would have been a little bit sad.

930
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,661
You know, every time you look around, it's just like, nothing.

931
00:43:21,262 --> 00:43:23,263
So in the end, we just went for this.

932
00:43:24,963 --> 00:43:26,984
And yeah, it's not perfect, but it works.

933
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:31,130
Okay, so the controller often gets in the way,

934
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:33,771
and that's something that happens in games

935
00:43:34,512 --> 00:43:35,312
with camera and walls,

936
00:43:35,732 --> 00:43:37,333
but basically we used a lot of transparency

937
00:43:37,613 --> 00:43:39,073
whenever Astro was behind the controller

938
00:43:39,313 --> 00:43:40,214
or under your body.

939
00:43:42,194 --> 00:43:44,055
And that was really useful for vertical gameplay

940
00:43:44,075 --> 00:43:45,595
because sometimes you need to see,

941
00:43:46,196 --> 00:43:47,816
yeah, Astro just under you.

942
00:43:49,197 --> 00:43:50,557
And so during those times, yeah.

943
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,119
That was really useful to have that transparency.

944
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:55,599
It's a classic thing in games,

945
00:43:55,659 --> 00:43:58,900
but it was a first for us as well.

946
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,541
The respawn, to deal with death and respawn transition,

947
00:44:03,881 --> 00:44:05,722
we went with very simple, quick fade to black.

948
00:44:05,782 --> 00:44:07,423
So you will see here, oops.

949
00:44:08,424 --> 00:44:13,046
Okay, I've got, sorry, I should have told you,

950
00:44:13,106 --> 00:44:19,069
but once per presentation, I crash, so there you go.

951
00:44:19,129 --> 00:44:19,450
Once again.

952
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,521
So this is the respawn fade.

953
00:44:23,581 --> 00:44:26,463
So you're gonna see here, gonna die, okay.

954
00:44:26,803 --> 00:44:27,904
And this is a quick black screen.

955
00:44:28,725 --> 00:44:31,166
So we tried lots of kind of really intricate effects

956
00:44:31,206 --> 00:44:32,387
with the screen shattering

957
00:44:32,427 --> 00:44:34,348
and then some kind of respawning in first person,

958
00:44:34,368 --> 00:44:36,009
but especially when you have something like that,

959
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:37,830
like the Minecraft level where you're going at high speed.

960
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:39,531
The last thing you want to do at that point

961
00:44:39,591 --> 00:44:41,712
is to bring lots of effects and things like that.

962
00:44:41,733 --> 00:44:45,335
So we did that and it didn't do anything good really.

963
00:44:45,395 --> 00:44:46,816
It just made people more uncomfortable.

964
00:44:46,916 --> 00:44:48,457
So we just went for fade to black.

965
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:52,816
Okay, two more sections.

966
00:44:53,076 --> 00:44:54,137
First one is level building.

967
00:44:57,158 --> 00:45:00,900
So this is about how we got around to editing our levels.

968
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,261
So this is our level editor.

969
00:45:02,281 --> 00:45:04,142
It's in Maya, and it's hooked up to the game in real time.

970
00:45:04,562 --> 00:45:07,203
And alone, it still means that you have to put the headset on regularly,

971
00:45:07,243 --> 00:45:09,024
but the great thing about it is that it's real time.

972
00:45:10,757 --> 00:45:11,937
So when you make a change in Maya,

973
00:45:12,237 --> 00:45:15,639
it's reflected in the game within a fraction of a second.

974
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:17,600
And it's really good for working as a pair.

975
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,541
So one person is controlling Maya,

976
00:45:19,621 --> 00:45:22,802
one person is in VR just giving feedback and orders.

977
00:45:23,483 --> 00:45:25,583
And then, yeah, you can build a level together

978
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:26,284
like that with a friend.

979
00:45:29,625 --> 00:45:30,906
We didn't always do that, of course,

980
00:45:30,946 --> 00:45:33,207
because it means having two people working together.

981
00:45:34,748 --> 00:45:37,189
But here, for example, stretching up, that's done.

982
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:38,730
Yay.

983
00:45:41,263 --> 00:45:42,564
They say hello to all of you, by the way.

984
00:45:43,905 --> 00:45:46,127
OK, also we made the levels from building blocks.

985
00:45:46,207 --> 00:45:48,969
So these are really basic shapes that the designers can use.

986
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,952
And they can change the scales to some extent,

987
00:45:51,992 --> 00:45:53,593
but they can't really mess around with them too much,

988
00:45:53,873 --> 00:45:56,335
because the idea is to keep the base proportions.

989
00:45:57,594 --> 00:46:00,316
So the artist then come in and replace those blocks

990
00:46:00,857 --> 00:46:04,080
with art versions and then add topicals and things like that.

991
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,641
And of course, there are special pieces,

992
00:46:05,781 --> 00:46:07,422
which are special props, and these ones

993
00:46:07,502 --> 00:46:08,883
are kind of custom made.

994
00:46:09,944 --> 00:46:12,026
But in general, for the large majority

995
00:46:12,066 --> 00:46:14,468
of the base of the level, we're using this system.

996
00:46:14,548 --> 00:46:16,810
And we only did the principle,

997
00:46:17,931 --> 00:46:19,312
we only really used that properly

998
00:46:19,372 --> 00:46:20,253
near the end of a project.

999
00:46:20,313 --> 00:46:21,794
It took us some time to really kind of

1000
00:46:22,415 --> 00:46:25,017
break some old habits, but now we're kind of

1001
00:46:25,097 --> 00:46:26,858
in a mindset of working with building blocks.

1002
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:30,392
And also it means that sections of levels can be repurposed.

1003
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,993
So for example, here we had a canyon level,

1004
00:46:32,013 --> 00:46:34,695
but it was too long, just too long.

1005
00:46:34,775 --> 00:46:38,677
So we chopped up the last part, and we brought it

1006
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,578
to the fire stage.

1007
00:46:40,979 --> 00:46:42,440
And we kind of repurposed the assets,

1008
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:44,861
or kind of changed the textures, et cetera.

1009
00:46:45,562 --> 00:46:47,543
And that was the first section of another level.

1010
00:46:47,563 --> 00:46:50,385
So it was a really efficient way of working and kind

1011
00:46:50,425 --> 00:46:51,345
of shifting stuff around.

1012
00:46:51,385 --> 00:46:52,886
And near the end of the project, we

1013
00:46:52,906 --> 00:46:55,368
were really still shifting big parts of level.

1014
00:46:56,289 --> 00:46:58,229
Now, to achieve variety, we had a checklist

1015
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:00,331
of how the levels were distributed.

1016
00:47:00,371 --> 00:47:02,071
And also, we updated that checklist

1017
00:47:02,492 --> 00:47:04,593
with all of the sections I've been talking about today,

1018
00:47:04,653 --> 00:47:07,454
VRness, physical play, gadgets, stuff like that.

1019
00:47:07,514 --> 00:47:09,095
And then we just populated.

1020
00:47:11,156 --> 00:47:14,397
And the idea wasn't to just fill the entire table,

1021
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:16,338
because that would have been overstimulating for the player.

1022
00:47:16,478 --> 00:47:19,100
But the idea is to just get a good idea of whether we kind

1023
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,181
of balanced as an experience.

1024
00:47:23,573 --> 00:47:24,735
And then the last thing is gameplay first.

1025
00:47:24,755 --> 00:47:26,616
So going back to the beginning of the presentation,

1026
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,098
you know, we prototype a lot,

1027
00:47:28,298 --> 00:47:30,800
and that means actually every single piece of gameplay,

1028
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,122
we always do it first with a gameplay programmer on his own,

1029
00:47:33,763 --> 00:47:34,764
and then we bring the artist.

1030
00:47:34,824 --> 00:47:36,425
And we never break that rule,

1031
00:47:36,465 --> 00:47:38,767
and when we break that rule, it's always a mess.

1032
00:47:38,987 --> 00:47:41,970
We end up with just like, you know, in difficult situations.

1033
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:43,511
So here's the Dandelion.

1034
00:47:43,531 --> 00:47:44,993
That's the programmer's version, art version,

1035
00:47:45,033 --> 00:47:46,414
programmer version, art version.

1036
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:55,411
So that's the water gadget first prototype.

1037
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:02,000
And that's also true of transitions,

1038
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,061
like this is a game designer's whale,

1039
00:48:04,561 --> 00:48:05,501
and then the big whale.

1040
00:48:06,081 --> 00:48:09,122
That's the boss from the Gorilla Boss.

1041
00:48:09,142 --> 00:48:10,323
He used to be a dragon.

1042
00:48:10,803 --> 00:48:13,544
But see, the gameplay is actually identical.

1043
00:48:13,744 --> 00:48:15,184
And then there being the Gorilla Boss.

1044
00:48:16,224 --> 00:48:17,325
This one is even more striking.

1045
00:48:17,405 --> 00:48:18,705
It's really, really respected.

1046
00:48:19,725 --> 00:48:21,946
So the timings, the size, the gameplay,

1047
00:48:22,026 --> 00:48:23,766
everything is really common.

1048
00:48:25,518 --> 00:48:27,238
checked first and

1049
00:48:27,399 --> 00:48:32,600
What's nice about this is that it means that you really kind of creating gameplay with a really small set of people as well

1050
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:37,542
So that you know in terms of reviewing it tweaking and making sure that we are okay gameplay wise

1051
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:40,403
It's done between you know like half, you know half a dozen people

1052
00:48:40,443 --> 00:48:44,844
That's it and then after that meanwhile the artists are busy researching how to make things

1053
00:48:45,224 --> 00:48:49,066
But they don't work on the game on those prototypes directly once it's proven

1054
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:53,167
Then we open the doors and then you know, it becomes a more classic on a production relationship

1055
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,348
And then finally, visuals.

1056
00:48:55,368 --> 00:48:59,994
So to be honest, it could have been a talk, an entire talk.

1057
00:49:00,374 --> 00:49:02,016
I'm just going to touch on three topics that seem

1058
00:49:02,036 --> 00:49:02,998
important to me as visuals.

1059
00:49:04,259 --> 00:49:07,543
We created, you know, we have a lot of organic levels,

1060
00:49:07,603 --> 00:49:11,448
but we wanted to retain the sci-fi DNA of the playroom

1061
00:49:11,468 --> 00:49:12,008
and those robots.

1062
00:49:12,048 --> 00:49:14,611
So we put a lot of printed circuit boards on organic stuff.

1063
00:49:15,582 --> 00:49:17,484
Also, the levels, we didn't want to have to worry

1064
00:49:17,524 --> 00:49:18,785
about making so much art,

1065
00:49:18,805 --> 00:49:20,968
because when you look down a level,

1066
00:49:21,008 --> 00:49:22,549
you can see to infinity in VR,

1067
00:49:22,569 --> 00:49:24,571
so we didn't want to have to worry about that.

1068
00:49:24,611 --> 00:49:25,672
So we made Floating Island.

1069
00:49:25,692 --> 00:49:27,194
We did study that at the beginning of the project,

1070
00:49:27,774 --> 00:49:29,556
and then we created a nice cloud shader.

1071
00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:31,297
So the cloud shader is animated.

1072
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:33,379
We put quite a bit of effort into it,

1073
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,423
but it could save 20 levels or something like that.

1074
00:49:38,024 --> 00:49:40,046
So that was a good investment for the return that we got.

1075
00:49:41,488 --> 00:49:46,410
The characters, so the way we go about it is that they're kind of cute mechanical designs

1076
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:49,811
and you know you can get really close to them in VR and it's really important to have that

1077
00:49:49,831 --> 00:49:55,292
kind of endearing feeling but also we pay attention to the details so that you know

1078
00:49:55,312 --> 00:49:58,193
you can see all the cogs and all the parts and if we wanted to make toys out of them

1079
00:49:58,233 --> 00:49:59,073
we could easily do it.

1080
00:50:00,353 --> 00:50:01,934
That's why they have this kind of tangible feeling.

1081
00:50:03,115 --> 00:50:07,299
And the same thing goes for the gadgets.

1082
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,581
They have the same kind of degree of fantasy about them,

1083
00:50:09,621 --> 00:50:11,623
but they're all inspired from real-life tools as well.

1084
00:50:12,124 --> 00:50:14,726
So like water guns, shurikens, slingshots, machine guns,

1085
00:50:15,006 --> 00:50:16,828
lights, they're all kind of real objects.

1086
00:50:16,868 --> 00:50:18,910
And so we're able to kind of really ground them.

1087
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:23,135
And the parts are designed as if they were real products,

1088
00:50:23,575 --> 00:50:25,177
so that you can look at them closely in VR

1089
00:50:25,237 --> 00:50:26,438
and you can see all the little parts.

1090
00:50:29,674 --> 00:50:31,595
Okay, so that was visual and that's it for us.

1091
00:50:31,715 --> 00:50:34,617
But no, because we have a special section.

1092
00:50:35,057 --> 00:50:35,958
I think that's gonna be the one

1093
00:50:35,998 --> 00:50:38,179
that you guys have most fun about, right?

1094
00:50:38,219 --> 00:50:39,480
This is all the fails on the project.

1095
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:43,102
So the game was multiplayer to begin with, actually.

1096
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,643
So it started as multiplayer,

1097
00:50:45,163 --> 00:50:47,844
and it was one VR player and three players on the TV.

1098
00:50:47,884 --> 00:50:50,006
So that was a continuation of what we did on Playroom VR.

1099
00:50:50,846 --> 00:50:51,566
And it was really fun.

1100
00:50:51,586 --> 00:50:53,207
It was so much fun, you know, playing four players.

1101
00:50:55,148 --> 00:50:55,329
But.

1102
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:58,424
The TV camera's range being limited,

1103
00:50:58,705 --> 00:51:01,432
the level designer could not exploit the VR properly.

1104
00:51:02,655 --> 00:51:04,620
So what you had was a lot of stuff like that, corridors.

1105
00:51:06,971 --> 00:51:08,831
And when he was in corridors, he was a little bit more open,

1106
00:51:08,851 --> 00:51:09,812
but it was still a corridor.

1107
00:51:11,352 --> 00:51:13,632
And so many levels felt like that.

1108
00:51:13,853 --> 00:51:15,233
Bosses, however, they worked really well,

1109
00:51:15,293 --> 00:51:16,293
because they were single screen.

1110
00:51:17,153 --> 00:51:19,654
So you can do that on the TV, and you can do that in VR.

1111
00:51:20,014 --> 00:51:21,894
As long as your camera angle on the TV

1112
00:51:21,914 --> 00:51:23,375
can show that big boss, then you're good.

1113
00:51:24,375 --> 00:51:26,175
So that was a four-player version of the bosses.

1114
00:51:26,715 --> 00:51:30,536
And so in the end, we also tried to do some mini-games separated

1115
00:51:30,576 --> 00:51:32,797
from the main game, because we didn't

1116
00:51:32,817 --> 00:51:33,997
want to have to throw all that stuff away.

1117
00:51:34,037 --> 00:51:36,498
It's really good to have people having a laugh.

1118
00:51:37,499 --> 00:51:41,163
And really, every morning we were having a blast playing the game together and it was so fun, right?

1119
00:51:42,185 --> 00:51:47,151
But then clearly we were making the wrong game because we were focusing on multiplayer at the expense of VR.

1120
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:51,156
So all the stuff I talked about today, the VRness, the verticality, all of that, we couldn't do it

1121
00:51:51,216 --> 00:51:54,580
because the camera on the TV wouldn't allow us to follow the action.

1122
00:51:55,814 --> 00:51:59,856
So we decided to separate both of them to rebalance the game.

1123
00:51:59,936 --> 00:52:02,858
And in fact, it was effectively a cancellation of multiplayer.

1124
00:52:02,918 --> 00:52:05,220
It happened halfway through the game, so nine months

1125
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,001
into the 18 months.

1126
00:52:07,301 --> 00:52:10,404
And that meant that, to be honest,

1127
00:52:10,604 --> 00:52:12,425
the levels we had after nine months were not that good.

1128
00:52:13,145 --> 00:52:15,487
So from that nine months onwards,

1129
00:52:15,587 --> 00:52:17,869
then the designers were able to focus on VR properly.

1130
00:52:18,349 --> 00:52:20,791
And then we started seeing some real good VR levels

1131
00:52:20,831 --> 00:52:21,271
coming through.

1132
00:52:21,831 --> 00:52:23,653
And after that, the level design really took off.

1133
00:52:25,776 --> 00:52:27,757
Um, yeah, and then other kind of, uh,

1134
00:52:27,977 --> 00:52:30,099
quick selection of components that we prototyped and cut.

1135
00:52:30,299 --> 00:52:31,780
And then often because they were not fun,

1136
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,041
really hard to fit in the game,

1137
00:52:33,141 --> 00:52:34,942
or they were, like, not in line with the IP.

1138
00:52:35,082 --> 00:52:36,863
I don't know. Maybe you can guess which one that was.

1139
00:52:38,344 --> 00:52:40,925
Um, but, uh, yeah, gadgets and stuff like that.

1140
00:52:40,945 --> 00:52:43,687
So, you know, we cut quite a bit of content as well.

1141
00:52:45,076 --> 00:52:47,139
And also we did an art direction reboot.

1142
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,605
That happened about the same time as the multiplayer.

1143
00:52:51,266 --> 00:52:54,131
The style was too kiddy, too, you know, it was colorful,

1144
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,494
but it was the kind of wrong kind of colorful.

1145
00:52:57,852 --> 00:53:00,715
And so at that time, we had the same kind of review,

1146
00:53:00,775 --> 00:53:02,816
and we thought, OK, let's take it down a route of,

1147
00:53:02,836 --> 00:53:04,537
you know, it's playful, but it should remain

1148
00:53:04,578 --> 00:53:06,079
kind of sophisticated, cool.

1149
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,841
You know, PSVR owners are gamers,

1150
00:53:09,141 --> 00:53:11,183
and their reference points are very high.

1151
00:53:11,263 --> 00:53:16,006
So yeah, we went down for a more mature look,

1152
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:17,568
but we kept all the playfulness still.

1153
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:20,290
OK, that's it.

1154
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,472
So there's a few final thoughts for me, and I think for time.

1155
00:53:24,921 --> 00:53:25,761
Yeah, we're good.

1156
00:53:25,841 --> 00:53:32,123
So first of all, so the game became quite popular.

1157
00:53:32,163 --> 00:53:33,443
We had some really nice reviews.

1158
00:53:34,543 --> 00:53:38,384
And part of me is thinking that perhaps it

1159
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:42,205
is because it's a nice mix of nostalgia and high technology.

1160
00:53:42,585 --> 00:53:47,866
It is a game that, and I'm not going to make any lies about it,

1161
00:53:47,986 --> 00:53:51,047
it's taking into 30 years of platform game history.

1162
00:53:51,107 --> 00:53:51,887
It is pop culture.

1163
00:53:51,907 --> 00:53:53,108
We all grew up with those games, 2D, 3D.

1164
00:53:54,708 --> 00:54:01,774
And so I think the fact that it's tapping into this nostalgia plus the addition of the coolness of VR,

1165
00:54:01,814 --> 00:54:07,219
I think it is perhaps what made it stand out as a kid's dream.

1166
00:54:07,299 --> 00:54:11,382
Perhaps it is the kind of game that we used to visualize in our kids' heads when playing 2D 8-bit games.

1167
00:54:14,807 --> 00:54:18,269
The other thing, and that's probably the biggest revelation, that's more of a personal thing, but

1168
00:54:19,911 --> 00:54:21,892
you know, we started the project and I was telling you that

1169
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:26,636
it was all about, I remember being at GDC in fact, you know

1170
00:54:27,396 --> 00:54:30,439
being talked to by VR purists, experts, saying that

1171
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,681
it had to be first person and virtual hands, or it wasn't VR.

1172
00:54:34,622 --> 00:54:42,170
But if you look at last year, you know, we had Moss, we had Tetris Effect, you had Astro Bot, before that it was Rez.

1173
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:46,735
I think these are really, really great examples of classic games that have been reinvented for VR.

1174
00:54:47,636 --> 00:54:52,901
And so the point is to not copy and paste. It's not about taking those games and slapping them into VR.

1175
00:54:52,921 --> 00:54:56,305
I think we need to be able to deconstruct what was fun about these games in the 80s, 90s, 2000s.

1176
00:54:58,046 --> 00:55:02,591
And then reconstruct using our own words and our own technology.

1177
00:55:02,611 --> 00:55:04,653
And that's this very important point.

1178
00:55:04,673 --> 00:55:05,914
We often talk about that with the team.

1179
00:55:06,475 --> 00:55:09,538
It's not a copy and paste. It's an analysis and a reconstruction.

1180
00:55:11,928 --> 00:55:13,630
a non-VR version, so a lot of people come to us and say,

1181
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:15,150
hey, why don't you just make a non-VR version?

1182
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:16,851
Well, I think for the reasons I mentioned today,

1183
00:55:16,891 --> 00:55:18,312
it's like actually it was built for VR,

1184
00:55:18,372 --> 00:55:20,634
and so, you know, even if you played the game,

1185
00:55:20,694 --> 00:55:22,175
actually, on a flat screen,

1186
00:55:22,195 --> 00:55:24,336
you'd probably fail at a lot of the gems

1187
00:55:24,436 --> 00:55:26,978
because it was built for that 3Dness,

1188
00:55:27,018 --> 00:55:27,838
it was built for VR.

1189
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,520
So if it was a non-VR game, it'd be a different game.

1190
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,562
And that's it. So I just want to take a chance also to celebrate the team.

1191
00:55:37,063 --> 00:55:40,125
Astrobot was put together in 18 months with almost no other time, which is

1192
00:55:41,386 --> 00:55:42,407
very, very rare in Japan.

1193
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:46,731
And in a fun mood, and I think we could get a good platformer out against the odds.

1194
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:48,731
And it gives me a lot of hope for VR,

1195
00:55:48,771 --> 00:55:52,993
because many classic genres can be reinvented.

1196
00:55:53,253 --> 00:55:54,613
Adventure, racing, fighting.

1197
00:55:55,313 --> 00:55:59,194
If we apply the same approach, I think it's totally doable.

1198
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:01,535
So if you're thinking about it, really go for it.

1199
00:56:02,075 --> 00:56:03,176
Just ask yourself the right questions.

1200
00:56:03,216 --> 00:56:05,516
And I think, I want to see an adventure game.

1201
00:56:05,556 --> 00:56:08,777
I want to see a Metrovania kind of game in VR.

1202
00:56:08,797 --> 00:56:09,477
That would be really cool.

1203
00:56:09,497 --> 00:56:13,118
All right, so that was all from me.

1204
00:56:13,598 --> 00:56:14,399
Thank you for listening today.

1205
00:56:14,419 --> 00:56:15,359
Have a great time at GDC.

1206
00:56:15,379 --> 00:56:15,559
Thank you.
