1
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:07,520
You just say two words.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,421
I'm going to do the exact same thing,

3
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:10,342
and then I'm literally going to hand it off.

4
00:00:10,562 --> 00:00:13,504
So Adrian, all right.

5
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,546
Adrian Crook, I've known for many years.

6
00:00:16,927 --> 00:00:18,508
He runs a successful consulting company

7
00:00:18,648 --> 00:00:20,209
that consults on mobile free-to-play games,

8
00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:21,770
and unlike most consulting companies,

9
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,932
actually know what they're doing and give really good advice.

10
00:00:24,773 --> 00:00:26,054
And so Adrian.

11
00:00:26,154 --> 00:00:26,774
All right, all right.

12
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:28,255
I was going to stand.

13
00:00:28,275 --> 00:00:29,356
I'm going to probably take it from here,

14
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,177
though this seems like we can see each other, which

15
00:00:31,217 --> 00:00:31,778
was my worry.

16
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:36,163
Just to introduce the panel, of course, you know who I am,

17
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,066
you know who Dave is.

18
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:42,212
We have Punny beside me here, COO of Kongregate,

19
00:00:42,832 --> 00:00:45,276
and we have Mario, Managing Director of PikPok

20
00:00:45,356 --> 00:00:46,898
down beside Dave.

21
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:53,191
So, we only have half an hour, so I really want to get started before we waste too much time.

22
00:00:54,431 --> 00:01:01,113
I think a good place to start for the panel would just be fairly broadly around the idea of evergreen content,

23
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:08,895
and if it's possible, and how you strategize for it and design around it in order to hopefully lower your development costs.

24
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,431
Thoughts on evergreen content in general?

25
00:01:12,611 --> 00:01:13,391
Yeah, in general.

26
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:17,132
I mean, I know it's like a holy grail kind of thing,

27
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:18,672
like the idea that you build once

28
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,153
and it just serves your players forever.

29
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:21,953
But is it possible?

30
00:01:21,973 --> 00:01:23,194
And what have you seen work and not work?

31
00:01:23,474 --> 00:01:26,455
So this was, like one of our founding philosophies

32
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:28,375
since RIFOX was this idea that we were gonna make

33
00:01:28,695 --> 00:01:31,256
evergreen games that people could play over and over again

34
00:01:31,276 --> 00:01:33,096
and we were not gonna be a content-driven company.

35
00:01:33,456 --> 00:01:34,957
And that was gonna be how we managed to

36
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:36,757
not only control our costs,

37
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:38,718
but be more innovative than other companies.

38
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:40,979
And that's like, you can see that in something like

39
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,180
Triple Town and Alphabear, right?

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,562
Both of those games are heavily, heavily, heavily

41
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:45,983
driven by an evergreen core mechanic

42
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:47,024
that you can play over and over again.

43
00:01:47,064 --> 00:01:48,665
And there's still to this day, you know,

44
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:50,227
I don't know how many hundreds of thousands

45
00:01:50,247 --> 00:01:52,188
of millions of people who play Triple Town

46
00:01:52,248 --> 00:01:53,989
even though we haven't updated it in forever.

47
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,413
It's a, you know, but what we've learned unfortunately

48
00:01:58,473 --> 00:02:00,134
is that as the free-to-play market has matured,

49
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:02,596
it's getting harder and harder to make money

50
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:03,857
if you simply are like,

51
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,298
I have a great evergreen core mechanic

52
00:02:05,338 --> 00:02:06,739
and here's a couple things that plug into it.

53
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:07,560
Like that.

54
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,661
you can have good retention that way,

55
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:11,401
potentially, if you're lucky,

56
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:13,942
but you almost certainly won't have good revenue.

57
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:16,062
And so what we've started doing is

58
00:02:16,282 --> 00:02:18,223
we still want the evergreen core mechanic

59
00:02:18,303 --> 00:02:20,563
because we still think that gives tremendous value,

60
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:23,224
but we're starting to try to be a little bit smarter

61
00:02:23,284 --> 00:02:25,004
about what we plug in around that.

62
00:02:25,284 --> 00:02:26,124
So in AlphaBear 2,

63
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:27,845
which is hopefully coming out later this year,

64
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:31,006
still evergreen core mechanic, just like we had before,

65
00:02:31,346 --> 00:02:34,066
but now we have like a narrative that goes along with it,

66
00:02:34,106 --> 00:02:36,207
which is sort of this like pseudo back to the future-esque,

67
00:02:36,227 --> 00:02:37,787
you broke time and you have to fix it thing.

68
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:42,751
Um, and, uh, there's a whole campaign, which we had in Alphabear 1, but it didn't really

69
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:45,774
feel like much of a campaign, and now you're actually, you have like Mario World style

70
00:02:45,814 --> 00:02:49,537
maps that you're navigating through, and, um, and there's a bunch of extra modes that

71
00:02:49,557 --> 00:02:53,260
plug in that all reuse the same core mechanic, but they have different flavors and different

72
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,184
things, and so, like, there is a lot more content in our games.

73
00:02:58,064 --> 00:02:59,886
to sort of support a richer modernization.

74
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:03,029
But that said, there's still that core

75
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:04,871
that means that we don't have to be constantly,

76
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:06,432
like I don't have to pay a level designer.

77
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,674
We actually do have different, quote unquote,

78
00:03:08,694 --> 00:03:10,876
levels in Alphabear, but they're very, very easy to make

79
00:03:11,076 --> 00:03:12,578
because they're based, again, on this evergreen core.

80
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,921
And that's the idea, is like, you know, we can't get away from making content,

81
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:20,023
but we want to make it so that level design and playtesting of the levels

82
00:03:20,103 --> 00:03:23,886
costs as little as it conceivably can, and that art budget is really, really low,

83
00:03:23,946 --> 00:03:26,588
and on and on and on. And that, I think, we've been able to be successful about,

84
00:03:26,628 --> 00:03:30,390
and I think you can still do that as long as you have the proper trappings around it.

85
00:03:32,427 --> 00:03:38,950
I remember years ago seeing actually a slide from Congregate that linked app updates basically

86
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,711
with retention.

87
00:03:40,111 --> 00:03:44,734
So if you're not making frequent app updates, is that something you think hurts retention

88
00:03:44,774 --> 00:03:46,655
or how do you still sort of ping people to?

89
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:47,675
There's no getting away from that.

90
00:03:47,715 --> 00:03:48,896
You have to do frequent app updates.

91
00:03:49,177 --> 00:03:51,738
And again, the question is, can you make it so that the

92
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,380
update doesn't cost you a ton to do?

93
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,723
So you have a new event that people can get excited about,

94
00:03:57,983 --> 00:04:01,646
but that event is mostly just a tiny bit of new art.

95
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:04,608
Some level designer spent an hour designing a new level for

96
00:04:04,648 --> 00:04:05,009
it, or whatever.

97
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:08,892
As opposed to, I had to spend a month of engineering time

98
00:04:08,952 --> 00:04:10,113
just preparing this one thing.

99
00:04:10,413 --> 00:04:12,294
And if you look at most of the successful free-to-play games

100
00:04:12,354 --> 00:04:14,476
out there, a lot of them are like this, where you look at

101
00:04:14,536 --> 00:04:15,397
they do an update.

102
00:04:16,277 --> 00:04:17,278
tons of new content.

103
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,619
It's not really tons of new content, right?

104
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:19,960
Like it didn't actually take that long

105
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,040
for them to make the content,

106
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,822
but it feels meaningful because of the way it plugs

107
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:26,243
into this evergreen core that they've built, so.

108
00:04:26,623 --> 00:04:31,064
I guess related to that is making sure you get the most out of the content that you build

109
00:04:31,124 --> 00:04:31,484
as well.

110
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:37,846
So if you do stuff for a Christmas update or a Halloween update, one of the things we

111
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:43,387
try to do is making sure that that content automatically resurfaces the next year.

112
00:04:44,147 --> 00:04:46,848
And that way, not only do you have to...

113
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:54,655
not do an update, necessarily a binary update for your players to get access to that content.

114
00:04:55,936 --> 00:05:00,141
But you don't have to get into the coding of it again and if you don't have a live team

115
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:03,103
on it, you know, you're not having to relearn all the code.

116
00:05:03,164 --> 00:05:08,309
So it's been important for us to do a little bit more work up front when we do some of

117
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:10,591
those kind of seasonal updates or events.

118
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:15,888
to make sure that that content automatically comes back around the next time

119
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,570
and you get that repeated value over the life of the product.

120
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:23,415
But you're essentially doing new Christmas, let's say, content every year anyways.

121
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:28,259
You're just saying it adds to the library of Christmas content, let's say, that you have in the product?

122
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,502
It depends and sometimes plans change.

123
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:35,586
You know, we had one game this last Christmas that we were planning to do something

124
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:37,108
and we just ran out of bandwidth.

125
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:43,313
So we ran with last year's event content, Christmas event content, and actually the

126
00:05:43,353 --> 00:05:47,595
player base loved that because they got access to the characters and stuff that they may

127
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:49,696
have missed out on last time that they knew existed.

128
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:58,681
So yes, we're trying to stack up updates and make seasonal stuff more and more, but very

129
00:05:58,741 --> 00:06:00,982
important if you're going to do the work to have...

130
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:08,444
a Christmas themed thing get that value every single Christmas, every single time.

131
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:18,367
Apple, you know, likes to see the icon update and see something actually physically change.

132
00:06:18,807 --> 00:06:22,188
So we have done some instances where we've done a binary update,

133
00:06:22,568 --> 00:06:25,248
but literally the only thing we've changed is the icon.

134
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:30,070
Because all the underlying stuff is already there anyway and automatically switches on.

135
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:35,066
Yeah, the depressing thing about free-to-play games is,

136
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:39,309
even a good game is only going to have maybe 1 or 2% D90 retention.

137
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:42,511
So, in a way, if you're not reusing the content,

138
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:46,253
like, you're giving up on something fresh for the 99% of people

139
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,394
who are seeing it for the first time.

140
00:06:47,534 --> 00:06:49,395
So, you can be smart, right?

141
00:06:49,495 --> 00:06:51,276
Reuse the stuff each year and do something new.

142
00:06:51,296 --> 00:06:54,318
You shouldn't just put out the same thing again and be like,

143
00:06:54,438 --> 00:06:55,698
hey, hope you don't notice.

144
00:06:55,798 --> 00:06:57,219
Like, you should add something to it,

145
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,120
add a new character, add a new...

146
00:07:00,077 --> 00:07:05,222
Boss battle added a little bit of a new like hook to the fiction or whatever the case may be but

147
00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:08,865
If you're smart about it, you should not be doing that new each year, right?

148
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:12,168
You should be able to build on top of what you built last year add some new

149
00:07:12,928 --> 00:07:16,391
competitive elements about it or some new reward system, but

150
00:07:17,352 --> 00:07:19,514
You know like a again a year later

151
00:07:20,595 --> 00:07:25,759
270 days later chances are ninety nine point eight percent of those users are seeing it. It's new to them

152
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,121
So be smart about reusing the content

153
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:33,920
Yeah, that's something that some of our designers were a bit worried about when for games that

154
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,502
have regular events and they want to do something new every time.

155
00:07:38,062 --> 00:07:44,106
And we do want to keep bringing new content for those regularly engaged players, those

156
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,387
long-term engaged players.

157
00:07:45,907 --> 00:07:47,628
But like you say, if we repeat

158
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:52,992
an event which has great content every three months.

159
00:07:53,352 --> 00:07:55,174
97% of the players experiencing that content

160
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:56,074
haven't seen it before.

161
00:07:56,675 --> 00:08:01,298
So we've had to make sure that we're not

162
00:08:02,018 --> 00:08:04,560
putting our whole content pipeline to work for the 3%

163
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,222
that are in there long term.

164
00:08:07,703 --> 00:08:08,863
But just to contradict myself.

165
00:08:09,841 --> 00:08:12,964
the 1% to 2% that is there a year later are literally your

166
00:08:12,984 --> 00:08:13,805
most valuable players.

167
00:08:13,945 --> 00:08:17,548
So they're going to remember last year that it was the

168
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:21,692
Valentine's event with that particular character that was

169
00:08:22,732 --> 00:08:23,613
the boss or whatever.

170
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:26,656
And so a year later, you should not reuse.

171
00:08:26,876 --> 00:08:28,538
You should actually look at what you did before, look

172
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:29,118
what's working.

173
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:30,719
Hopefully you've got analytics in place so you can

174
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:32,521
understand where the engagement was.

175
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:34,403
Stop doing the stuff people don't like to do.

176
00:08:34,483 --> 00:08:36,505
But if you're building a new event, each

177
00:08:38,545 --> 00:08:43,624
each holiday season or Halloween or whatever, you're basically not getting the full...

178
00:08:44,353 --> 00:08:48,374
value of the investment that you're making in providing that content to that audience.

179
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:52,375
I've also been very impressed, like I agree 100% with what you just said, Penny, but I

180
00:08:53,155 --> 00:08:58,316
will say this, that I've been playing Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes a lot recently and been

181
00:08:58,336 --> 00:09:00,596
pretty impressed by their metagame design.

182
00:09:01,237 --> 00:09:04,597
And one of the things that I've noted that's interesting about that is they'll launch this

183
00:09:04,637 --> 00:09:07,598
event and they'll make a really big deal of it and everyone treats it like a big deal

184
00:09:07,618 --> 00:09:10,818
even though if you really analyze how much work went into making that event it doesn't

185
00:09:10,838 --> 00:09:11,478
seem like that much work.

186
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,180
And then what they'll do is that that event will be a rare event and they'll have you,

187
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,661
I don't know how it will show up, whether it shows up once every month or once every

188
00:09:18,701 --> 00:09:20,522
six months, I don't know, it depends, they have different frequencies.

189
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:23,203
But what's interesting is that they'll make it so that the thing, the award that that

190
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:26,504
event gives, you don't get enough of it the first time you play that event.

191
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,684
You have to play it like five times.

192
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,006
And if it's only coming up once every three months, it's like, oh.

193
00:09:31,907 --> 00:09:35,830
I'm going to have to play for quite a while before I actually get the final big reward

194
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,353
of this event, which is almost always a character that you really want, one of the Star Wars

195
00:09:39,373 --> 00:09:39,673
characters.

196
00:09:40,113 --> 00:09:44,196
And the fact that I'm playing the same event five times over is not a problem for me.

197
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,818
I'm not like, oh, it sucks that it's the same event.

198
00:09:46,838 --> 00:09:49,681
It's actually a good thing that it's the same event, because that way I don't have to relearn

199
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:51,762
it and waste a lot of time trying to get the character that I want.

200
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:54,143
So that's an actually, as far as I'm concerned,

201
00:09:54,163 --> 00:09:58,565
an excellent example of how they're controlling their cost.

202
00:09:58,585 --> 00:10:00,806
They build this thing once, they have you play it five times

203
00:10:00,826 --> 00:10:03,527
over the course of a year, and you're perfectly okay

204
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:05,628
with the fact that it's not changing during that time.

205
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,330
I'm gonna change the speed a little bit.

206
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,132
In the early going, when you're in development,

207
00:10:14,152 --> 00:10:16,513
you haven't launched yet, is there a particular

208
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:22,507
KPI that you're using to sort of design features, like you have KPI, let's say you have in mind

209
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:27,430
when you're designing features, knowing that you can't, potentially you can't satisfy all

210
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,012
KPIs. And I'll just sort of get to the point here. One of the games we've been consulting

211
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:36,694
on now for about three years is a game called Hempire. It's like a weed growing game. It's

212
00:10:36,714 --> 00:10:40,956
done pretty well and we're involved with it today, even in a live ops perspective.

213
00:10:41,716 --> 00:10:44,338
But one of the things we didn't do was a good solid meta game

214
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:45,078
right from the start.

215
00:10:45,118 --> 00:10:46,299
We just we had to allocate.

216
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:47,119
We didn't have much money.

217
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:51,161
This is two guys in the suburbs of BC that came to us.

218
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:52,742
One was a real estate developer.

219
00:10:52,762 --> 00:10:54,543
And they have no game experience.

220
00:10:54,563 --> 00:10:56,204
So we essentially had to use their money very.

221
00:10:57,005 --> 00:11:03,248
carefully and so you know very compelling early game a very strong community because the weed community is super strong that we hope would

222
00:11:03,268 --> 00:11:04,269
stand in for like the

223
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:10,973
Long-term metagame and it did but now we're working on the metagame. You know when the product launched almost a year ago now, so

224
00:11:11,773 --> 00:11:14,114
Have you had to make similar trade-offs like that where?

225
00:11:15,235 --> 00:11:18,036
You know maybe can't touch on you know day one

226
00:11:18,897 --> 00:11:24,780
Day seven day thirty and beyond with that initial feature set, but you you know what were those trade-offs, and you know

227
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,342
what feature or KPI did you prioritize?

228
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:33,425
I think it's hard when you start thinking about,

229
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:34,706
okay, we're going to launch this,

230
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:37,328
and then two weeks later or a month later

231
00:11:37,408 --> 00:11:40,129
we'll drop these features and this content,

232
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,071
and then a month later we'll drop this,

233
00:11:42,711 --> 00:11:44,492
because it never works out like that.

234
00:11:46,294 --> 00:11:53,221
For one, users always get through your content faster than what your team thinks they will.

235
00:11:54,482 --> 00:11:58,747
And on top of that, there's all the stuff that comes up, issues and opportunities when

236
00:11:58,767 --> 00:11:59,588
you launch something.

237
00:12:00,028 --> 00:12:05,914
So it's really difficult now, we've found, when our teams are saying, oh, well, we've

238
00:12:06,857 --> 00:12:09,899
trying to make compromises here, we want to push this back,

239
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,601
because we'll just do that in the first update.

240
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:16,704
And the reality is it's probably update three by the

241
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:17,604
time that comes in.

242
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:22,167
So you have to be really careful about what you push

243
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:25,289
back to make sure you don't undermine yourself at launch.

244
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:31,573
I think for us, the two key metrics that we look at to try

245
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:33,794
and make sure we have to a good place before we launch

246
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:34,215
are.

247
00:12:35,093 --> 00:12:37,654
day one retention and opt-out.

248
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:42,136
And for us, retention buys you time.

249
00:12:42,817 --> 00:12:44,878
If you have good retention from the outset,

250
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:46,438
even if your other metrics aren't quite

251
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:50,320
where they need to be, you can keep that launch audience

252
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,742
around hopefully long enough to get those updates out

253
00:12:53,782 --> 00:12:55,223
and get those other KPIs up.

254
00:12:56,551 --> 00:13:02,833
And as long as your updow is high enough, you can at least monetize those users that are sticking around

255
00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:11,416
Well enough, hopefully that you can fund that ongoing development. So updow and and day one retention are pretty big for us

256
00:13:12,596 --> 00:13:13,236
so

257
00:13:14,557 --> 00:13:16,838
This isn't necessarily shared by everyone at congregate

258
00:13:16,898 --> 00:13:20,879
But in my opinion the only thing that matters is the shape of your retention curve

259
00:13:22,077 --> 00:13:26,679
Because the difference between a good game and a great game happens in that first week.

260
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:33,042
And pretty much any game, even a terrible one, if it knows what it's doing, can manipulate

261
00:13:33,342 --> 00:13:35,763
a player into getting a good D1 retention.

262
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,165
They've just seen terrible games with good D1 retention.

263
00:13:40,146 --> 00:13:42,528
But the users are very smart.

264
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:46,091
And a week in, no one's sticking around in a bad game.

265
00:13:46,552 --> 00:13:50,035
And a game that is rich, that has a lot of interesting

266
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:54,639
systems, or maybe a multiplayer component that is

267
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:58,082
compelling, or it has a strong aspiration, it's going to have

268
00:13:58,122 --> 00:13:59,764
a great week one curve.

269
00:14:00,484 --> 00:14:00,624
And

270
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:06,310
A game that is all bells and whistles and doesn't deliver on the promise, it just is

271
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:13,435
a hook, won't survive more than a day or two before retention just takes a nosedive.

272
00:14:13,595 --> 00:14:18,098
Monetization is important, super important, but if you've got someone who will stick around,

273
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:19,840
then you can monetize them.

274
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:24,387
Usually, if you've got a great game,

275
00:14:24,427 --> 00:14:27,809
it's also very easy to monetize, because whatever is compelling

276
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:30,530
is usually also something that you can also monetize

277
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,571
in one direction or another.

278
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:35,853
And so for me, it's about, do you have a great game?

279
00:14:35,873 --> 00:14:37,113
Does it have depth?

280
00:14:37,453 --> 00:14:39,494
Does a player experience it in a way

281
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:41,495
where they can see their own journey through the game?

282
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,356
And that draws them through the experience.

283
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:47,538
And that if you just optimize against D1, or looking at a CPI,

284
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:49,118
or looking at ARPDAU or something,

285
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,399
you're not looking at the full picture.

286
00:14:51,038 --> 00:14:56,401
But if you're going to pick one thing, for me it's that the curve of the retention is the most important thing.

287
00:14:56,641 --> 00:15:00,123
Because even if you start low, if it's flat, you're good to go.

288
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,561
Regrettably, we're not as sophisticated as the other

289
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:07,122
companies here.

290
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:09,582
We're small, and we have limited resources.

291
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:11,843
And so there are certain things that, while we think

292
00:15:11,863 --> 00:15:14,744
would be very important to understand, monetization is

293
00:15:14,784 --> 00:15:16,544
actually a pretty critical example.

294
00:15:16,884 --> 00:15:19,325
We literally are not in a position to understand them.

295
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:21,085
And those of you who are small but have been doing free to

296
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,246
play for a while will probably sympathize with this.

297
00:15:23,286 --> 00:15:26,587
It's like, if only 2% of your users are spending money, then

298
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:29,648
you need to have statistically significant data on your

299
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:30,328
monetization.

300
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,990
at least on the spend component, the dollar spend, IP component of your monetization,

301
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:42,433
you need so many thousands of people to download the game. And to get those has historically

302
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:46,495
required spend that, you know, in soft launch that we're not capable of making. Like I can't

303
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:52,138
afford to spend $50,000 acquiring test users for my game. You know, I mean, in theory we

304
00:15:52,178 --> 00:15:53,659
could, but we choose not to.

305
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:57,502
because we're scared and we'd rather spend that money somewhere else.

306
00:15:58,783 --> 00:16:01,425
So that has meant that even though we think monetization is fairly important,

307
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,587
we tend to ignore that and say, like, well, if the retention is good enough,

308
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:09,011
particularly the long-term retention, that will at least give us time to fix the monetization later,

309
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:13,174
assuming, and this is the big if, this is the only thing that I think I'm really adding to this conversation,

310
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,595
assuming that you have the hooks for it.

311
00:16:14,795 --> 00:16:17,857
One of the critical mistakes we've made in the past is that we made a game that was...

312
00:16:18,558 --> 00:16:22,180
delightfully fun, but there was no good way to monetize it.

313
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,381
It didn't have the proper structure, the proper bones.

314
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:26,522
Triple Town is a great example of this.

315
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:28,983
Triple Town did not have the bones to become a game

316
00:16:29,003 --> 00:16:30,244
that could be successfully monetized.

317
00:16:31,245 --> 00:16:33,126
The core was too satisfying in and of itself,

318
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:34,566
and nobody cared about anything

319
00:16:34,606 --> 00:16:35,427
that was outside of the core.

320
00:16:36,447 --> 00:16:37,868
So we were never, despite the fact

321
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:41,450
that it had amazing retention and tons of downloads,

322
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,051
we never actually got that game to the point

323
00:16:43,071 --> 00:16:44,431
where it made a lot of money per user.

324
00:16:44,672 --> 00:16:45,632
Did you try loot boxes?

325
00:16:46,404 --> 00:16:47,867
And that's just a joke. That's just a joke.

326
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:50,674
Guys, sorry. Sorry. Wow.

327
00:16:50,814 --> 00:16:52,057
The second day you were like, argh!

328
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:55,212
So, we tried a lot of things.

329
00:16:56,334 --> 00:16:57,895
But anyway, so the...

330
00:16:58,956 --> 00:17:00,498
We didn't necessarily try everything that we should have.

331
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:02,780
But anyway, the bottom line is that that was our major screw-up.

332
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,142
So now when we're launching a game, we're like...

333
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:06,324
We try to make sure that it'll have good long-term retention

334
00:17:06,364 --> 00:17:08,046
to the greatest extent possible in soft launch.

335
00:17:08,306 --> 00:17:11,249
And we also make damn sure throughout the design process

336
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:12,691
and especially in the beginning that we're building something

337
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:14,233
that we think has the bones for like...

338
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,814
If we screwed up the monetization...

339
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:18,195
if we find out after worldwide launch

340
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:19,236
that we screwed up the monetization,

341
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:21,136
that the bones are there, that it's like,

342
00:17:21,196 --> 00:17:22,417
okay, well, they're not buying this thing,

343
00:17:22,457 --> 00:17:23,857
but we can add this thing, and they might buy that.

344
00:17:23,897 --> 00:17:25,098
We could add this thing, they might buy that.

345
00:17:25,398 --> 00:17:28,339
And we also take ads way more seriously than we used to,

346
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:29,619
because that's something that you don't need

347
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:31,640
nearly as many users.

348
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,321
Like, it's not just, if you've done your job correctly,

349
00:17:34,381 --> 00:17:36,401
not just 2% of your users watch ads, right?

350
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:38,542
So you can get statistically significant data

351
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:41,463
on ad watching way earlier in the process.

352
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:44,044
And so we take getting people to watch ads

353
00:17:44,224 --> 00:17:45,965
way more seriously than we used to.

354
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:48,685
And anyway, so that's our solution

355
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:50,486
as a small, less sophisticated company.

356
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:54,727
But I think data, or relying on data is maybe,

357
00:17:56,588 --> 00:17:58,248
it's dangerous, and again,

358
00:17:58,408 --> 00:18:00,109
Congregate's usually known for its data,

359
00:18:00,149 --> 00:18:01,369
but for me it's more about,

360
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,391
you don't need statistical significance, I think,

361
00:18:06,471 --> 00:18:08,771
to build a strategy around monetization.

362
00:18:09,992 --> 00:18:12,192
It's more important that you really empathize

363
00:18:12,232 --> 00:18:13,953
and understand the motivations of your player.

364
00:18:16,143 --> 00:18:17,643
I actually don't remember where I saw this,

365
00:18:17,683 --> 00:18:20,304
but there's this idea of the scent of blood,

366
00:18:20,805 --> 00:18:22,725
just an awful visual,

367
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:24,666
but bloodhounds catch the scent of blood

368
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:27,027
and they will dive into holes and dig

369
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,789
to find their quarry.

370
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:33,089
And so if you really understand the gold

371
00:18:33,129 --> 00:18:34,110
at the end of the rainbow,

372
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,111
you can take the player through that journey

373
00:18:36,191 --> 00:18:38,311
and provide many opportunities to monetize

374
00:18:38,472 --> 00:18:40,652
if you understand the gold that they're searching for

375
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:41,973
in a holistic way.

376
00:18:42,033 --> 00:18:43,574
It's not just a, here's a paywall.

377
00:18:45,394 --> 00:18:47,456
whether it's a game where there's friction around

378
00:18:47,516 --> 00:18:50,359
progressing very quickly, and so timers obviously

379
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,081
make a lot more sense in that scenario.

380
00:18:52,121 --> 00:18:54,383
If it's a power game, being able to have a number

381
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:57,346
that goes up more rapidly than your competition,

382
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:59,287
and then deconstructing all the ways

383
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:01,089
you can create systems around that

384
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,052
doesn't require statistical significance,

385
00:19:04,112 --> 00:19:05,613
but if you wanna validate that you've made

386
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:08,256
the right decisions, then obviously that's important.

387
00:19:08,276 --> 00:19:09,036
But you can't...

388
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,564
You have to take responsibility for the actual design of the modernization.

389
00:19:15,724 --> 00:19:20,669
That's a difficult thing to do, but that's not something that you should be saying,

390
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:21,791
okay, well, we'll just guess.

391
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:25,094
You should actually be doing the hard work to understand the player, their motivations,

392
00:19:25,154 --> 00:19:29,479
and build systems that are going to allow you to create interesting systems and features

393
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:30,040
and content.

394
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,861
I couldn't agree more.

395
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:32,743
That's basically what I meant by building the right bones.

396
00:19:32,763 --> 00:19:32,983
Absolutely.

397
00:19:33,003 --> 00:19:33,083
Okay.

398
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:33,243
Yeah.

399
00:19:33,263 --> 00:19:33,343
Yeah.

400
00:19:33,384 --> 00:19:33,464
Yeah.

401
00:19:33,484 --> 00:19:33,564
Yeah.

402
00:19:33,584 --> 00:19:33,664
Yeah.

403
00:19:33,684 --> 00:19:33,784
Yeah.

404
00:19:33,804 --> 00:19:33,884
Yeah.

405
00:19:34,443 --> 00:19:39,766
So I'm sure a lot of people are sitting here wondering how you can build a game, yes, cheaply

406
00:19:39,786 --> 00:19:44,409
from a development perspective, but how do you not spend, you know, six, seven figures

407
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:45,009
on UA?

408
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:50,532
Like, that, I think, is something we'd all love to know, is, you know, have you had success

409
00:19:50,572 --> 00:19:54,315
building a game that you haven't needed to blow your brains out on UA over?

410
00:19:54,335 --> 00:20:01,299
So, it's a discussion that comes up a lot at Kongregate, because...

411
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:07,803
In theory, if you want to control the destiny of your business, you want your strategy to

412
00:20:07,863 --> 00:20:11,787
involve user acquisition, if you have access to capital to drive user acquisition.

413
00:20:11,847 --> 00:20:15,411
So if you have access to capital, it's an asset you require in order to be able to access

414
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:16,171
user acquisition.

415
00:20:16,652 --> 00:20:19,655
That informs the whole framework around how to think about designing your game in order

416
00:20:19,675 --> 00:20:21,616
to tap into that opportunity.

417
00:20:21,657 --> 00:20:23,759
And what it does is it reduces the risk, right?

418
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:27,762
Because now you can control whether or not, like if you just happen to launch the site.

419
00:20:28,423 --> 00:20:31,245
the next Supercell game and you just get slammed in featuring,

420
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:32,686
there's still a path to success.

421
00:20:32,746 --> 00:20:33,967
Maybe it takes a little bit longer.

422
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,629
But if that's not your situation,

423
00:20:37,089 --> 00:20:38,831
then you optimize around featuring.

424
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:40,112
And then there's a whole strategy

425
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:41,753
around understanding what Apple's looking for,

426
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,814
Google's looking for, what are following platforms that

427
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:45,776
can allow you to capture some of that investment back.

428
00:20:46,723 --> 00:20:48,323
But that's like a two-hour discussion.

429
00:20:49,543 --> 00:20:51,864
Yeah, and I know on Hempire we were lucky because we had

430
00:20:51,904 --> 00:20:55,065
about a half a million dollars for that initial UA period.

431
00:20:55,745 --> 00:20:57,425
Right, so then you can get something off the ground,

432
00:20:57,445 --> 00:20:58,626
and then month to month after that,

433
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:02,546
it's all just reinvested profits.

434
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:06,167
For Pickpuck, we only started doing paid UA last year.

435
00:21:06,727 --> 00:21:10,228
So we built our whole portfolio,

436
00:21:10,428 --> 00:21:12,609
and the success that we've had

437
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:15,589
has been driven completely by organic downloads.

438
00:21:15,689 --> 00:21:16,450
And I guess for us.

439
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:26,665
We try to build games that we think people will be looking for and will appeal to broad

440
00:21:26,725 --> 00:21:27,765
audiences generally.

441
00:21:27,885 --> 00:21:33,048
So we have a lot of sports games in our portfolio because we know that there are basketball

442
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:39,231
fans or football fans or soccer fans or whoever and we know that those leagues are turning

443
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:44,113
over and people are watching those games and people are searching for games on that kind

444
00:21:44,153 --> 00:21:44,533
of niche.

445
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:47,168
or that kind of interest on the store.

446
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:52,592
So we played into that as we've built out our portfolio

447
00:21:53,572 --> 00:21:58,656
and tried to make games that are inherently appealing

448
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,657
and not necessarily being just another,

449
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,340
here's another obscure RPG with a weird name

450
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,801
that nobody's searching for.

451
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:10,223
You know, we're making things that people can get

452
00:22:10,403 --> 00:22:12,344
and wrap their head around and they really

453
00:22:12,384 --> 00:22:13,225
have an appetite for.

454
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:16,086
So that's worked out really well for us.

455
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:24,649
Now we're finding paid UA is a great addition to that and that's helping supercharge the

456
00:22:24,689 --> 00:22:25,030
business.

457
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:34,314
But you can totally make games that don't require user acquisition as long as you can

458
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:39,736
build something that is going to be appealing to a large audience and it helps if you can

459
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:42,377
position it in such a way that Apple and Google feature it as well.

460
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,862
which is a whole nother discussion.

461
00:22:46,062 --> 00:22:46,804
It's a whole nother panel.

462
00:22:46,844 --> 00:22:47,785
Yeah, that really is, I mean,

463
00:22:48,687 --> 00:22:49,648
you can't really understate that.

464
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,911
I mean, like, we've never done paid QA in large part

465
00:22:51,931 --> 00:22:53,434
because we haven't been able to afford it historically.

466
00:22:53,814 --> 00:22:55,878
And we, a huge chunk.

467
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,462
of our launch strategy for any game is make sure

468
00:23:00,482 --> 00:23:01,662
that Apple and Google wanna feature it.

469
00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:03,503
Which is obviously a huge risk,

470
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:05,384
because if that's a big chunk of your strategy,

471
00:23:05,424 --> 00:23:07,385
and these are big companies whose priorities change,

472
00:23:07,425 --> 00:23:08,726
and whose employees change and stuff,

473
00:23:08,746 --> 00:23:10,006
and you could be screwing yourself, right?

474
00:23:10,026 --> 00:23:11,267
There's no guarantee you're gonna get featured.

475
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:13,208
But there's certainly things you can do

476
00:23:13,688 --> 00:23:16,789
to increase the probability, and we absolutely do them.

477
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:21,051
We maintain as close a relationship as we conceivably can

478
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,052
with Apple and Google.

479
00:23:22,172 --> 00:23:24,413
Like, that is, I will drop any meeting

480
00:23:24,573 --> 00:23:25,213
for a meeting with them.

481
00:23:25,694 --> 00:23:28,775
and everyone who I would drop that meeting with would totally understand why I was doing it.

482
00:23:30,536 --> 00:23:35,558
If Apple has a new thing that they're pushing really hard, it really honestly doesn't matter

483
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:39,459
whether it's a natural fit for my game. If I can find a natural use case for it, I will.

484
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,241
Because that increases the odds that they'll want to feature the game.

485
00:23:44,902 --> 00:23:48,523
And on and on. There's a bunch of subtleties too. Apple obviously cares quite a lot about

486
00:23:49,364 --> 00:23:52,926
visuals and usability and all that thing. And it's not to say that they would never feature.

487
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:56,408
Clearly, obviously, they would occasionally feature a game with terrible UI, but if your game does

488
00:23:56,428 --> 00:23:59,450
have terrible UI, you're way less likely to get featured by them, right? This is something that

489
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:04,253
they care about as a core thing. So, you know, fortunately, we also believe that having a good

490
00:24:04,313 --> 00:24:07,115
UI is a really good thing for the game in general. So this is not like a conflict of interest or

491
00:24:07,135 --> 00:24:11,318
anything, but we make a point of emph- like, we always put a little bit extra in making sure the

492
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:13,059
game feels like something they would be delighted by.

493
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:15,060
And on and on and on and on.

494
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,981
So that's a big part of our strategy,

495
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:18,821
and I don't think you can be a successful indie

496
00:24:18,841 --> 00:24:20,182
if that isn't a big part of your strategy.

497
00:24:20,242 --> 00:24:23,063
But additionally, the other thing that we've become,

498
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,684
I would hope, a little bit more sophisticated about.

499
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:28,485
When we started off, we were like almost every other indie.

500
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:30,186
Oh, we'll make a great game and that'll be enough.

501
00:24:31,335 --> 00:24:32,136
Obviously, that's not enough.

502
00:24:33,896 --> 00:24:36,738
And so now we've started to ask questions exactly like you

503
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:38,438
were saying, like, OK, well, why?

504
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:39,679
Why would someone want to play this?

505
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:41,660
How will it stand out in a crowded market?

506
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,501
But also we'll say things like, well, what is the unique

507
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,081
thing that will make people want to talk about this game

508
00:24:45,101 --> 00:24:47,462
with their friends, which is something that is obviously

509
00:24:47,482 --> 00:24:47,982
very hard.

510
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,143
If that was an easy question to answer, then everyone would

511
00:24:50,183 --> 00:24:52,685
do it, and everything would be viral.

512
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:53,785
But that's obviously not the case.

513
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,566
But nevertheless, it's still worth asking.

514
00:24:55,606 --> 00:24:57,507
A lot of people just assume that precisely because it's a

515
00:24:57,547 --> 00:24:59,147
hard question, what's the point in even trying?

516
00:24:59,728 --> 00:24:59,828
And

517
00:25:00,588 --> 00:25:01,849
No, you should always try.

518
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:05,652
And AlphaBear, arguably, would not have been a tenth of the

519
00:25:05,692 --> 00:25:08,935
success it was if it wasn't for the bear speech sharing

520
00:25:08,995 --> 00:25:11,196
thing that happens in that game, which took over Twitter

521
00:25:11,216 --> 00:25:12,277
for like a week at launch.

522
00:25:13,898 --> 00:25:15,179
And we do that for every single game.

523
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,901
We're working on an MMO now called Steambirds.

524
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:18,542
And in Steambirds, it's the same idea.

525
00:25:20,462 --> 00:25:21,302
This is a hardcore game.

526
00:25:21,322 --> 00:25:22,583
There's a lot of hardcore games out there.

527
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:23,644
Like, why will people play this one?

528
00:25:23,684 --> 00:25:25,065
And it's not enough to say, well, it's different.

529
00:25:25,905 --> 00:25:26,746
There has to be more.

530
00:25:26,766 --> 00:25:28,507
So we're like, OK, well, how do we get streamers to be

531
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,007
interested in it?

532
00:25:29,047 --> 00:25:31,369
What do we put in the game that will make this interesting

533
00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:32,770
to stream in a way that no other game is

534
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:33,510
interesting to stream?

535
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:38,374
What do we put in here that makes users so proud of, or so

536
00:25:38,414 --> 00:25:41,216
annoyed, or so amused by something that just happened

537
00:25:41,236 --> 00:25:43,197
that they're willing to share an animated GIF of it, and on

538
00:25:43,217 --> 00:25:43,397
and on.

539
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,438
And we have these conversations.

540
00:25:44,478 --> 00:25:46,619
And these conversations are not a small part of the design

541
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:47,600
discussion for the game.

542
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,501
They're a very significant part of the design discussion

543
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:49,881
for the game.

544
00:25:50,242 --> 00:25:55,123
And that sort of thing is something that, even though we all recognize you should probably do it,

545
00:25:55,163 --> 00:25:58,783
is something that I've noticed that for whatever the reason it tends to like fall to the wayside.

546
00:25:58,803 --> 00:26:02,844
Because there's just so many other things that you absolutely have to do that that stuff ends up being like,

547
00:26:02,884 --> 00:26:04,825
well, okay, we'll get to that.

548
00:26:05,405 --> 00:26:06,845
You can't. I would argue you just can't.

549
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:08,946
You can't have that attitude that I'll get to that eventually.

550
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:11,306
That has to be a core part of your thinking about the game from the beginning.

551
00:26:11,386 --> 00:26:15,987
Unless you're in a position to do tons of paid UA, in which case good for you, but we're not.

552
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,561
I will say that when we started Hempire, there was no chance Apple would feature us.

553
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,642
I mean, they still will not.

554
00:26:24,002 --> 00:26:25,682
But that was also part of the strength.

555
00:26:25,722 --> 00:26:27,143
There was a lot of white space in the store.

556
00:26:27,163 --> 00:26:31,945
And I remember looking at a sensor tower, kind of competitive competition index for

557
00:26:31,985 --> 00:26:35,547
certain keywords, App Store keywords, and you could tell there was a lot of white space,

558
00:26:35,567 --> 00:26:39,408
like a high search volume, low competition for those particular keywords around weed

559
00:26:39,468 --> 00:26:42,550
just because EA or Zynga is not going to make a weed game anytime soon.

560
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,592
And so that was one of the ways that we knew we had an audience we could serve relatively

561
00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:47,132
cheaply.

562
00:26:47,192 --> 00:26:47,472
So there's...

563
00:26:47,952 --> 00:26:49,773
it's sort of a trade-off, we're never gonna get featured,

564
00:26:49,793 --> 00:26:51,873
but we also have a way of potentially tapping

565
00:26:51,913 --> 00:26:53,934
into an audience that's being underserved right now.

566
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:56,995
I would kill to figure out what that next thing beyond weed

567
00:26:57,435 --> 00:26:58,895
that's similarly underserved is,

568
00:26:58,915 --> 00:27:00,716
but even when we started,

569
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:03,076
we weren't sure we'd be able to be on the App Store,

570
00:27:03,116 --> 00:27:04,957
so there's a bit of risk associated with that too.

571
00:27:04,977 --> 00:27:05,957
Right.

572
00:27:08,222 --> 00:27:10,764
We're sort of almost out of time. We had a couple minutes

573
00:27:10,784 --> 00:27:13,006
Let's see

574
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:16,529
So many questions here at originally we thought this was going to be an hour long

575
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:17,870
So I've got way too many questions

576
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:23,214
As far as third-party tools go is there is if I assume it's better to you know

577
00:27:23,294 --> 00:27:27,958
Buy than build are you building a lot of your own third party or sorry internal tools. Are you?

578
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:29,759
Are you buying them?

579
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:35,697
So we've had a long history of going back and forth between third party engines and

580
00:27:35,717 --> 00:27:43,562
building our own stuff and I guess for us, shifting all of our development a few years

581
00:27:43,602 --> 00:27:46,824
back to Unity has been the best thing that we've ever done.

582
00:27:46,844 --> 00:27:52,727
It just makes, it has its limitations, it has its quirks, but it's getting better and

583
00:27:52,747 --> 00:27:58,611
better and for us the speed at which we can develop and the opportunities it lets us respond

584
00:27:58,671 --> 00:27:58,791
to.

585
00:28:00,238 --> 00:28:03,459
That has been huge for our business.

586
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:08,681
And actually, one of the successes of our Into the Dead game

587
00:28:08,901 --> 00:28:13,643
was the fact that it wasn't built on our own engine.

588
00:28:14,143 --> 00:28:16,384
It was one of the first games that we built on Unity

589
00:28:16,584 --> 00:28:20,525
and it was only built on Unity because we prototyped that game with artists.

590
00:28:20,785 --> 00:28:22,326
So we couldn't give them any programmers.

591
00:28:23,954 --> 00:28:28,878
Being on Unity allowed us to be much more flexible

592
00:28:28,918 --> 00:28:31,801
with the resources that we applied to that game

593
00:28:31,921 --> 00:28:33,522
and take it to many more platforms.

594
00:28:34,683 --> 00:28:38,166
So if there's an opportunity, whether it be engines,

595
00:28:38,247 --> 00:28:41,089
whether it be sound assets or art assets,

596
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,892
as long as you can put your own spin on it

597
00:28:45,012 --> 00:28:47,415
and you can bring your creative potential to it,

598
00:28:48,713 --> 00:28:49,853
Don't reinvent the wheel.

599
00:28:50,873 --> 00:28:52,574
Get the off-the-shelf solution.

600
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:56,355
And your life will be way easier.

601
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:56,895
What he said.

602
00:28:56,915 --> 00:28:57,775
That's perfect.

603
00:28:58,656 --> 00:29:01,536
And so does that apply to outsourcing as well?

604
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:04,537
And I know a lot of your company is distributed, like

605
00:29:04,597 --> 00:29:04,917
remote.

606
00:29:05,197 --> 00:29:08,158
How do you think that plays into cost savings versus

607
00:29:08,298 --> 00:29:10,139
potentially giving up that creative

608
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:11,159
control and collaboration?

609
00:29:11,505 --> 00:29:13,869
We've, man, I'm not gonna have time to answer this properly.

610
00:29:14,531 --> 00:29:16,775
So to be clear, our company is remote,

611
00:29:16,995 --> 00:29:18,318
but we don't consider them outsourced.

612
00:29:18,358 --> 00:29:20,041
Everyone, regardless of where they work in the world,

613
00:29:20,162 --> 00:29:23,528
they're like almost two of a man or a woman, full-time.

614
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:27,403
working on our stuff and we treat them like a member of the family and so they're not

615
00:29:27,563 --> 00:29:30,364
really outsourcing. When we have tried outsourcing, which we have actually tried, where

616
00:29:30,384 --> 00:29:34,086
there's like, like we need you to port a version of AlphaBear or we need you to do this or

617
00:29:34,127 --> 00:29:38,409
that, like this separate entity of, you know, whether it's one, two, three, four people,

618
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:42,651
um, that's been very hit or miss for us. Sometimes it's worked out well, often times it's

619
00:29:42,671 --> 00:29:48,675
worked out very poorly, um, we have a unique culture, I think, um, and, and, uh, and the fact

620
00:29:48,695 --> 00:29:51,516
that we're distributed makes things more complicated and...

621
00:29:52,197 --> 00:29:53,857
getting someone to plug into our culture,

622
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:56,198
who know, you know, even if they've been following us

623
00:29:56,218 --> 00:29:57,398
for a while and knows a lot about us,

624
00:29:57,579 --> 00:29:58,419
can be very difficult.

625
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:01,620
And we have high standards, I'd like to think,

626
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,780
high standards for our games,

627
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,021
and that can also be very difficult

628
00:30:04,241 --> 00:30:05,401
with an outsourcing situation.

629
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:08,963
And so we've done it, but we tend to avoid it

630
00:30:09,123 --> 00:30:10,463
because, for those reasons.

631
00:30:11,123 --> 00:30:12,864
Yeah, the quick answer for us is

632
00:30:12,924 --> 00:30:15,765
we don't really outsource very much.

633
00:30:17,006 --> 00:30:19,867
And certainly when we have, it hasn't been cheaper.

634
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:23,019
to get the same quality as doing it internally.

635
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,163
What it does do is it allows you to respond to opportunities that you don't have the bandwidth

636
00:30:28,203 --> 00:30:28,383
for.

637
00:30:28,883 --> 00:30:34,366
So it's certainly something we are leveraging more and more and working with more and more

638
00:30:34,487 --> 00:30:40,170
external teams because we can't do everything internally, but there are flexible business

639
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:46,054
deals we can do to work with teams that don't do it cheaper, but at least let us do things

640
00:30:46,134 --> 00:30:47,775
that we otherwise don't have the bandwidth to do.

641
00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:55,192
Our entire company is built around working with outside developers, so I think for us

642
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,493
we don't even think about it as outsourced or not.

643
00:30:57,553 --> 00:31:04,336
It's all just about relationships and nurturing productive outcomes where if you find the

644
00:31:04,376 --> 00:31:08,338
right alignment in terms of the business structure, it's very easy to get everyone doing their

645
00:31:08,358 --> 00:31:08,738
best work.

646
00:31:09,078 --> 00:31:12,700
So we have not had a problem with it, and we don't really think about it as something

647
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,320
that is like...

648
00:31:14,731 --> 00:31:19,016
weird and they're like outside and it's like we literally work together on this project

649
00:31:19,136 --> 00:31:21,198
and it's worked just fine for us.

650
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:23,320
I think that's the critical distinction though.

651
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:29,246
You are literally built in an entity whose purpose is to partner with other developers

652
00:31:29,367 --> 00:31:30,748
and it's no surprise that you do it well.

653
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:32,130
We had to do it well in order to survive.

654
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:32,290
Exactly.

655
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:32,390
Yeah.

656
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:32,490
Yeah.

657
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:32,610
Yeah.

658
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:32,710
Yeah.

659
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:32,850
Yeah.

660
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:32,950
Yeah.

661
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:33,051
Yeah.

662
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:33,151
Yeah.

663
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:33,251
Yeah.

664
00:31:33,271 --> 00:31:33,351
Yeah.

665
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:33,451
Yeah.

666
00:31:33,631 --> 00:31:35,232
And, you know, I'll just finish up.

667
00:31:35,652 --> 00:31:37,393
We work on lots of different projects,

668
00:31:37,413 --> 00:31:38,813
but I'll just keep referencing Hempire,

669
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:40,114
because we've been most involved in that.

670
00:31:40,534 --> 00:31:42,055
We started with a group in South America

671
00:31:42,075 --> 00:31:44,796
that offered sort of cost savings,

672
00:31:44,876 --> 00:31:47,037
and they produced some excellent work for us,

673
00:31:47,077 --> 00:31:48,758
and then we transitioned the team internal

674
00:31:48,858 --> 00:31:50,839
once it became like a sustainable thing.

675
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:53,560
So that did, you know, work to sort of thread that needle

676
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,081
of like keeping costs down initially,

677
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,322
but then now we have more expensive resources,

678
00:31:57,362 --> 00:31:59,183
but they can do more, and they're more flexible

679
00:31:59,203 --> 00:31:59,943
because they're under one roof.

680
00:32:00,804 --> 00:32:02,225
We have hit 330.

681
00:32:03,706 --> 00:32:09,071
So if you want to ask these guys a question, we'll be out there probably on the other side of that wall.

682
00:32:09,652 --> 00:32:10,433
But thank you for coming out.
