1
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:09,960
Okay, hello everyone.

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,460
Wow, that's just amazing.

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,901
So many people here, it's incredible.

4
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:15,281
I'm super excited to be here.

5
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:17,082
My name is Joanna Piecka, I'm a computer scientist

6
00:00:17,082 --> 00:00:18,362
and game developer from Austria.

7
00:00:18,362 --> 00:00:20,463
That's because of my strong accent, you might know.

8
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:23,864
And I've heard, I was very nervous about this talk,

9
00:00:23,864 --> 00:00:26,704
but someone told me, I just need to inspire people

10
00:00:26,704 --> 00:00:31,106
with my talk in a soapbox and do a lot of frantic,

11
00:00:31,106 --> 00:00:32,646
and then I'm gonna be fine.

12
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:33,766
So I tried to do both.

13
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:37,971
And I would like to start with my backstory.

14
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:43,678
So I think everyone of us noticed a moment when you're, I don't know, you're out of motivation,

15
00:00:43,678 --> 00:00:45,521
you're not inspired anymore.

16
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:50,487
And I had this phase also a couple of years ago and I was stuck.

17
00:00:50,487 --> 00:00:51,388
I was stuck.

18
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:59,274
And I didn't have any inspiration and I was stuck not only in developing games, but also in playing games.

19
00:00:59,274 --> 00:01:04,939
So I played games all the time from the same genre, from the same developer.

20
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,361
I played those games from the same platform.

21
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:11,684
And I thought, okay, I'm stuck also in playing games, how can I develop any new games?

22
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:15,676
And I really tried to find new game mechanics,

23
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:17,237
but playing always the same games

24
00:01:17,237 --> 00:01:18,457
doesn't make any sense for that.

25
00:01:18,457 --> 00:01:21,718
So I thought I should try out something totally new,

26
00:01:21,718 --> 00:01:23,178
get out of my comfort zone,

27
00:01:23,178 --> 00:01:27,979
try games which I would never play in other circumstances.

28
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:30,100
And I thought getting out of this comfort zone

29
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,960
would eventually help me learning

30
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,161
and getting my inspiration back again.

31
00:01:35,201 --> 00:01:39,644
And so I wanted to combine it with something which I really like, and I love to travel.

32
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:45,989
I'm one of those crazy backpacking persons, trying to see all the countries,

33
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:47,530
and I would always buy a travel guide.

34
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:53,315
And if you look at a travel guide, you would get a list of things you should do in this country,

35
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:59,039
monuments you should visit, food you should try, movies you should watch,

36
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,201
everything to get the whole experience for this country.

37
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:04,603
But you never get an experience for games you should play.

38
00:02:05,514 --> 00:02:08,637
But I believe that our games are cultural goods as well.

39
00:02:08,637 --> 00:02:12,440
And people should think of this and should add those

40
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,242
to the travel guides.

41
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:16,364
I believe our games are fantastic for that.

42
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:17,825
They should be relevant.

43
00:02:17,825 --> 00:02:21,128
And that's why I tried to start a project, which I call

44
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:22,950
A Year of Playing the World.

45
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,272
And I tried to find and play games

46
00:02:25,272 --> 00:02:27,974
from all the different countries of the world, which

47
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:29,195
are roughly 200.

48
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,001
So I try to find and approach developers

49
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:35,764
and community people from the countries

50
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:37,446
and would ask them always the same question.

51
00:02:37,446 --> 00:02:40,390
If there is one game I should play

52
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,393
developed in your country, which one should it be?

53
00:02:43,393 --> 00:02:46,296
Ask yourself as well, it's quite an interesting question.

54
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:46,997
Pretty challenging.

55
00:02:48,005 --> 00:02:52,370
And I got a list full of inspirational games.

56
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:56,274
And I was inspired by environments, by strong characters,

57
00:02:56,274 --> 00:02:59,658
by really cool stories, and by fancy mechanics.

58
00:02:59,658 --> 00:03:03,102
But most interesting, it wasn't the games

59
00:03:03,102 --> 00:03:05,745
with the fancy mechanics which inspired me most.

60
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,592
It was games which were relevant to the culture or to the countries or to the regions.

61
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:18,034
And I want to give you some ideas for inspirations how to also create really interesting games that way.

62
00:03:18,034 --> 00:03:26,998
So maybe create a game with cultural relevance like they did in the game A Year Walk, a Swedish game,

63
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:31,820
where they use Swedish traditions which they taught through this game.

64
00:03:33,301 --> 00:03:41,147
Or tell personal stories relevant to your region, like Abdullah did in the game Pathout.

65
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:47,251
He actually tells the story how he escaped the Syrian war in 2014.

66
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:54,096
And he makes it even more personal, it's a very dramatic story, by adding YouTube-style comments to that.

67
00:03:55,748 --> 00:04:00,870
or something more fun, find and spread local fun stories,

68
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,471
local gems, local stories which are only known in this region.

69
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:07,772
So for example, this guy, the game

70
00:04:07,772 --> 00:04:12,254
is called KnÃ¶delkrieg in German, Dumpling War in English.

71
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:14,755
And there was a Bavarian man who was really

72
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,716
upset about the noise the aircrafts were making

73
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,896
very close to his house.

74
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:20,577
This was 1967.

75
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:25,178
And he decided to fight back by throwing dumplings at them.

76
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:34,411
But looking at those games, I also found a lot of issues and problems.

77
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:39,775
And one really big issue, I think we are developing games in a wrong way.

78
00:04:39,775 --> 00:04:43,658
Because we are not treating our games in a cultural good way.

79
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:48,682
We don't think of them as something which should be also preserved in 10 years or 100

80
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:49,402
years.

81
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:53,505
Some of the games I was trying to play were not even playable after one year anymore.

82
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:55,767
And now think of all the controllers

83
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:58,089
we're having right now, the engines we are using.

84
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,892
What will the controllers of the future look like?

85
00:05:01,892 --> 00:05:04,274
Can we play our games in 10 years still?

86
00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:07,017
And if it's cultural good, we need

87
00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:09,479
to think of ways of to solve this problem.

88
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,462
So develop your games with more care for the future.

89
00:05:13,462 --> 00:05:16,645
And please find inspiration by my list

90
00:05:16,645 --> 00:05:19,688
of the games from different countries on my website.

91
00:05:19,688 --> 00:05:20,728
Thank you.

92
00:05:31,214 --> 00:05:33,876
Thank you, Joanna.

93
00:05:33,876 --> 00:05:35,158
Hang on one sec.

94
00:05:35,158 --> 00:05:41,403
You're just too fast, Davey.

95
00:05:41,403 --> 00:05:42,464
That's what...

96
00:05:42,464 --> 00:05:44,586
Don't do it.

97
00:05:44,586 --> 00:05:45,767
Hi, I'm on video camera.

98
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:49,630
All right, please welcome Davey.

99
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,770
There it is.

100
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,692
Hi there, my name is Davey Readon.

101
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,674
I was the creator of The Stanley Parable,

102
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:02,896
The Beginner's Guide, and absolutely,

103
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,318
A True Crime Story featuring Keanu Reeves.

104
00:06:05,318 --> 00:06:07,219
Today, I wanna talk just a little bit

105
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:08,661
about some of the game design questions

106
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,102
that have been on my mind lately

107
00:06:10,102 --> 00:06:12,104
and some of the goals that I'm shooting for.

108
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:18,230
One of the ways that I really like to work is by setting myself these very impossible-sounding goals

109
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,114
and then figuring out how I can actually pull it off.

110
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:24,758
So I don't necessarily have answers to these questions just yet,

111
00:06:24,758 --> 00:06:27,040
but I thought I'd put them to you and see what you think.

112
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:33,187
So, I've been thinking a lot about why people continue playing a game after they've started.

113
00:06:33,187 --> 00:06:37,531
This is if we are assuming that the game is at least somewhat fun or interesting on a

114
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:43,037
core mechanical level, and if so, why does a person want to put in hour after hour on

115
00:06:43,037 --> 00:06:47,601
this one game as opposed to playing a different game or doing something else with their life

116
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:48,062
entirely?

117
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:51,105
Basically, what creates their engagement?

118
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:56,351
And for the purpose of this talk, I'm really only talking about single player games, socializing

119
00:06:56,351 --> 00:07:02,518
and competition in multiplayer games are sort of like their whole own separate motivators.

120
00:07:02,518 --> 00:07:08,304
So after a lot of thought, here's my personal interpretation, just mine, of why people continue

121
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:12,288
playing a game distilled into three extremely broad categories.

122
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,051
One is to become better or to optimize.

123
00:07:16,051 --> 00:07:21,195
It's the enjoyable feeling that you are better now at the game than you were when you started playing.

124
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:28,021
Number two is to make progress, watching your number go up or gaining more items or more stuff.

125
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:35,827
And number three is to see more content, because we like the story, we like the characters, we like the world, and we want to continue to see more of it.

126
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:43,852
So to me, these three things sum up what like 99.9% of games out there today are doing to

127
00:07:43,852 --> 00:07:46,075
create engagement with their players.

128
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:49,860
And this is really cool and we know that this is effective on some level and it can be a

129
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,742
lot of fun and we all like games like this.

130
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:55,223
So the question that I've been grappling with a lot lately is,

131
00:07:55,223 --> 00:07:58,764
how could you make a game that is engaging and compelling

132
00:07:58,764 --> 00:08:02,246
and that does not, at its core, rely on any of these three

133
00:08:02,246 --> 00:08:06,047
things to make you interested?

134
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:08,928
And by the way, I'm not saying none of them,

135
00:08:08,928 --> 00:08:12,489
but what could you do to not have them be the core

136
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:15,370
and then bring in other things and then bring these things in

137
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,651
later on once there is another core?

138
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:23,415
I think one of the things with these three things is, with these three points, is that

139
00:08:23,415 --> 00:08:27,519
they all rely on something outside the act of play itself to be interesting.

140
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:33,043
With the first, you're imagining a better, a future version of yourself who is better

141
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:33,584
at the game.

142
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:37,587
With the second, you're imagining a future where your number is bigger.

143
00:08:37,587 --> 00:08:41,611
With the third, you're imagining how cool it'll be to see the rest of the story.

144
00:08:41,611 --> 00:08:43,853
So in a way, they're all future motivated.

145
00:08:43,973 --> 00:08:49,095
and I would love to explore play that is engaging and compelling in this very moment

146
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:52,856
without that reliance on the future in order to provide the value.

147
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:58,498
I think that if I say this, right off the bat, a lot of people would say,

148
00:08:58,498 --> 00:09:00,279
that sounds like a toy.

149
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,580
And yes, this is typically how we think of toys,

150
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,481
is as a device that has no function except the intrinsic act of play.

151
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:12,003
But usually we draw a kind of ideological line between a toy and a video game.

152
00:09:12,724 --> 00:09:16,085
And we think of a game as having a point or a context

153
00:09:16,085 --> 00:09:19,766
that elevates it above the act of just play itself.

154
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:22,367
So the weird goal that I'm setting for myself

155
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:26,309
is to create a game that is intrinsically fun to play

156
00:09:26,309 --> 00:09:28,970
and that has the kind of context that would make us say,

157
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,351
this is a video game, but that does not at its core

158
00:09:32,351 --> 00:09:35,412
rely on any of these three things to be compelling.

159
00:09:35,412 --> 00:09:37,793
And like I said, I think that they can still be there,

160
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:40,414
but could they be something other than the soul

161
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:41,015
and direct?

162
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:43,537
reason why you would want to continue playing at all.

163
00:09:43,537 --> 00:09:48,841
So for example, what would a game be like that offered you interesting choices, but

164
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:54,345
you can't actually get better at making those choices, or you can't make more optimized

165
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:55,226
choices?

166
00:09:55,226 --> 00:09:59,329
What about a game where you're growing or making progress in an interesting way, but

167
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:03,892
where the future outcomes are obscured enough that as a player you can't ever concretely

168
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:06,654
see what specifically this progress will lead to?

169
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:13,621
What about a game that has a story, but you don't need to see every piece of content to get the story?

170
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:17,663
Say there are 10 hours of story content, but if you only play one hour,

171
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:20,764
you've gotten just as valid of an experience as someone who plays the full 10.

172
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:25,447
All of these sound a little bit counterintuitive in the modern design culture,

173
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:27,007
but that's why I'm really excited.

174
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:30,469
The bizarre and impossible-sounding goal that I've set for myself

175
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:33,750
is to try to create a game that does all of these things.

176
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:38,012
I don't have a good answer yet as to how exactly to do that, but here are a few games that

177
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,033
I look to as inspiration.

178
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:44,875
Desert Golfing is fun to play, you can get better, there's a score, there's new content,

179
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,136
but the game never explicitly rewards you for any of it.

180
00:10:47,136 --> 00:10:51,498
The score doesn't mean anything, many people never see the new content, and if you play

181
00:10:51,498 --> 00:10:55,119
it for hours, it's because you're genuinely enjoying being in this world and whacking

182
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:55,879
a golf ball around.

183
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,603
Everything is a vast simulation that has an actual point of view about the world and lots

184
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:06,105
of content to explore, but you can stop playing at pretty much any time and you've had just

185
00:11:06,105 --> 00:11:10,367
as valid of an experience as someone who's seen every piece of content in the game.

186
00:11:10,367 --> 00:11:11,968
Neko Atsume is sort of like this.

187
00:11:11,968 --> 00:11:15,150
If you haven't seen this, it's the mobile game where you leave out treats for cats

188
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,191
and at random times cats will show up.

189
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:23,696
It's fun to see new cats, but there is kind of an incentive to make more money and like collect the cats

190
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,178
So it's not a perfect example

191
00:11:25,178 --> 00:11:30,322
But this is really a descendant of Tamagotchi which had no particular win state

192
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:36,767
Except to feel connected with a tiny thing in your pocket and to treat it, you know with however you're feeling at the time

193
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:42,712
It's engaging. It's compelling and it doesn't rely on future outcomes to be fun. All right, that's all I got. Thanks everyone

194
00:11:51,205 --> 00:11:54,127
Thank you, Davey.

195
00:11:54,127 --> 00:11:57,328
All right, next slide.

196
00:11:57,328 --> 00:12:01,670
Please welcome Clarice.

197
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:09,514
Hello, everyone.

198
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:11,815
I'm Clarice Siron, co-founder and creative director

199
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:13,356
at Silverstring Media.

200
00:12:13,356 --> 00:12:17,017
And I want devs to see their games

201
00:12:17,017 --> 00:12:20,899
as spaces for change, healing, and contemplation.

202
00:12:22,087 --> 00:12:23,848
To that end, I would like to discuss with you today

203
00:12:23,848 --> 00:12:25,809
an underutilized but extremely on-trend narrative approach.

204
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:27,150
And that is to embrace the occult,

205
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,651
to open yourselves and your game to the dangerous, irrational

206
00:12:28,651 --> 00:12:29,511
world of magical thinking.

207
00:12:29,511 --> 00:12:29,811
Just a little bit.

208
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:49,862
Specifically though, I'm talking about divination.

209
00:12:49,862 --> 00:12:52,343
Divination is an ancient and widely diverse form of magic

210
00:12:52,343 --> 00:12:55,505
involving the use of an object or objects

211
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:57,826
to gain answers to questions,

212
00:12:57,826 --> 00:12:59,947
often for the purpose of preparing for the future.

213
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,648
Now, if that sounds to you

214
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:04,289
just a little bit like a simulation or a game,

215
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,870
you're already getting the idea.

216
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:06,030
Now,

217
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:11,508
Let's take a step back for a second,

218
00:13:11,508 --> 00:13:14,149
because I think one of the reasons why more and more

219
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:17,551
people are flocking to magic as an aesthetic, as an identity,

220
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:19,593
and as a sincere part of their lives

221
00:13:19,593 --> 00:13:24,216
is that magic is a customizable but ultimately shared

222
00:13:24,216 --> 00:13:26,997
cultural metaphor that focuses on the experiential aspects

223
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:28,778
of a situation rather than the technicalities.

224
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:30,099
So let's talk about tarot for a second

225
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:30,699
as an example of divination.

226
00:13:39,046 --> 00:13:41,008
Now, depending on your perspective,

227
00:13:41,008 --> 00:13:43,150
tarot might seem like a mystical tool

228
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,092
or a bunch of delusional nonsense,

229
00:13:45,092 --> 00:13:49,616
but I think of tarot as a game, one whose purpose has shifted

230
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:51,658
over time from gambling and entertainment

231
00:13:51,658 --> 00:13:54,080
towards contemplation and transformation.

232
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,744
Now, video games have been exploring divinatory cards

233
00:13:58,744 --> 00:13:59,325
since the 80s.

234
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,701
And some games have just copied it straight up.

235
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:06,143
Others have used it as a theme or a narrative framework.

236
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:08,684
Shout out to a game that I had the privilege of working on

237
00:14:08,684 --> 00:14:13,587
called Where the Water Tastes Like Wine.

238
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,928
But how do you design for divination?

239
00:14:15,928 --> 00:14:17,889
First, you have to understand that we're designing for

240
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:21,330
distinct, separate moments, separate from the mundane

241
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,872
world, but also from the regular flow of your game.

242
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:27,514
So guidelines one and two here help create that sense of

243
00:14:27,514 --> 00:14:28,174
separation.

244
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:35,657
Your divinatory tool or focus object should be special and stand out from the rest of the interactable things in your game.

245
00:14:35,657 --> 00:14:42,980
As far as creating a special space, I have some good news. You've already got this somewhat covered.

246
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:50,242
You want to invite and invoke a state of playfulness, creativity, and receptiveness, and games are already excellent at this.

247
00:14:51,295 --> 00:14:53,996
Number three, you want to put complex and interlocking

248
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:57,397
systems and ordering structures clearly on display.

249
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,097
But here's the kicker.

250
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:01,158
These systems don't actually need to work or have

251
00:15:01,158 --> 00:15:01,959
any meaning.

252
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,860
The mere suggestion of deep underlying logic

253
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,980
is often enough to send our brains

254
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,661
into an interpretive, pattern-recognizing overdrive.

255
00:15:09,661 --> 00:15:13,202
Number four and five are fairly self-explanatory.

256
00:15:13,202 --> 00:15:16,243
You're trying to create visual hooks for a player

257
00:15:16,243 --> 00:15:18,624
to find inspiration and hang their own personal narrative

258
00:15:18,624 --> 00:15:18,884
upon.

259
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,481
Number six, introduce randomness,

260
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:25,003
because this takes advantage of apophenia,

261
00:15:25,003 --> 00:15:27,586
which is the human tendency to seek out and find

262
00:15:27,586 --> 00:15:31,630
patterns and significance in random information.

263
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,773
Number seven, ask open-ended questions.

264
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:37,877
Stick to broad, common subjects, at least at the start.

265
00:15:37,877 --> 00:15:39,278
That'll help your players warm up.

266
00:15:41,034 --> 00:15:45,316
You can also make it clear to your players that there's no wrong answer and that it's

267
00:15:45,316 --> 00:15:47,978
up to them to decide how they perceive the moment.

268
00:15:47,978 --> 00:15:53,461
If you're curious about how to deal with an obstinate or nihilistic player, maybe check

269
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:57,144
out a game I worked on called Glitch Hikers and see how it responds to you being a stick

270
00:15:57,144 --> 00:15:58,624
in the mud.

271
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:03,147
You might also want to detach your divinatory moment from your game's other mechanics.

272
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:08,671
I'm a min-maxer, personally, so I have trouble getting into a free association mindset if

273
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:10,111
I'm worried about messing up my stats.

274
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:15,424
And the final two, mix and match any of these rules.

275
00:16:15,424 --> 00:16:16,464
Experiment.

276
00:16:16,464 --> 00:16:18,545
Borrow others or distill your own.

277
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:21,506
Generally, the more you use, the more hooks you have, and

278
00:16:21,506 --> 00:16:24,367
the wider success rate you'll have amongst your audience.

279
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:26,848
But use what works for you.

280
00:16:26,848 --> 00:16:32,790
So what are some benefits to bringing a divinatory moment

281
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:34,051
or two into your game?

282
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:35,672
Well, for starters, it's affirming.

283
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,403
A game, its creators and its players are not adversaries,

284
00:16:39,403 --> 00:16:41,824
though it sometimes can feel that way.

285
00:16:41,824 --> 00:16:43,746
Divinatory moments underscore the trust

286
00:16:43,746 --> 00:16:45,167
you're putting in your player.

287
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:47,129
It acknowledges that we are all co-creators

288
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:49,030
in the final experience.

289
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,692
That trust is empowering,

290
00:16:51,692 --> 00:16:53,233
and it's potentially quite transformative.

291
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:57,689
I would wager that we've all had deeply meaningful experiences

292
00:16:57,689 --> 00:16:59,091
with a video game before.

293
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:02,273
It's probably why most of us are here right now.

294
00:17:02,273 --> 00:17:07,437
And I found that by opening a game up to,

295
00:17:07,437 --> 00:17:10,120
or rather, offering your player an opportunity

296
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,081
to make a game be about what they need it

297
00:17:12,081 --> 00:17:14,783
to be about in that moment is a great way

298
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,526
to increase the chance of your game

299
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:20,348
having that meaningful transformative effect

300
00:17:20,348 --> 00:17:22,930
on others, which feels sweet when it happens.

301
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,041
Best of all, this is pretty scope efficient,

302
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,322
because any meanings or player interpretations

303
00:17:29,322 --> 00:17:33,563
can be mediated by abstract symbols.

304
00:17:33,563 --> 00:17:36,884
You and your game don't have to anticipate fully or understand

305
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:40,825
that a player is dealing with the loss of their great uncle

306
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:46,247
Billy, for example, in order to build upon it or acknowledge

307
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:46,367
it.

308
00:17:48,698 --> 00:17:52,841
Now, I didn't mean to stumble into magic and the occult when I joined games.

309
00:17:52,841 --> 00:17:54,382
I definitely didn't.

310
00:17:54,382 --> 00:18:01,227
But over the years I've had a great deal of fun and success experimenting with these techniques.

311
00:18:01,227 --> 00:18:05,531
And I hope you will use these arcane secrets wisely.

312
00:18:05,531 --> 00:18:07,152
Thank you.

313
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:18,977
Thank you, Claris.

314
00:18:18,977 --> 00:18:19,938
All right.

315
00:18:19,938 --> 00:18:21,938
Next up, please welcome Danny.

316
00:18:21,938 --> 00:18:21,978
Hi.

317
00:18:21,978 --> 00:18:22,178
Hello.

318
00:18:22,178 --> 00:18:22,238
Hi.

319
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:22,659
There you are.

320
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:22,719
Hi.

321
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:22,759
Hi.

322
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:22,879
Hello.

323
00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:23,079
Hello.

324
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:23,439
Yeah, Danny.

325
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:23,479
Hi.

326
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:24,239
How you doing, everybody?

327
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:24,880
Oh, you've got a big table.

328
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,060
Yeah.

329
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:25,860
Oh, that's all right.

330
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,620
All right.

331
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:26,660
Hi.

332
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:26,880
Hello.

333
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,661
So thanks for coming.

334
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:28,401
I just want to say hello to all of my friends

335
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:36,965
and to all of you watching firsthand.

336
00:18:39,513 --> 00:18:45,358
Hi, I'm Danny Baranowski. I'm a composer and game designer. I wrote the music for My Name

337
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:49,761
Isaac, Super Meat Boy, Cannibal, Crypt of the Necrodancer. Now I'm doing music and game

338
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:54,485
design with Brace Yourself Games. I was going to give an adorable talk about how game design

339
00:18:54,485 --> 00:18:59,709
is like the Britney Spears song Toxic, but it's going to have to wait because I had an

340
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:03,693
experience recently that hit me pretty hard. Cellulitis.

341
00:19:04,963 --> 00:19:07,404
Few weeks ago I was hospitalized for nine days with severe

342
00:19:07,404 --> 00:19:10,806
cellulitis. You don't need to know the detail. It was the

343
00:19:10,806 --> 00:19:14,887
most painful week of my whole life. I felt pain sharper than

344
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,508
what I've ever known possible. It wasn't great. But the

345
00:19:17,508 --> 00:19:19,249
experience gave me some clarity on something that I felt

346
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:22,430
compelled to talk about instead of Britney Spears. Maybe

347
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,411
someday I'll give that talk, though. It was going to be

348
00:19:24,411 --> 00:19:26,732
awesome. Lip syncing, dance moves, a little boom mic.

349
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:30,514
Anyway. Let me back up a little bit, though. Last seven or

350
00:19:30,514 --> 00:19:32,754
eight years I've suffered from chronic pain.

351
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:39,761
A few years back I was diagnosed with lupus. It's an immune system disease. Recently I was

352
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:45,926
undiagnosed lupus and diagnosed connective tissue disorder. If you ever dealt with immune

353
00:19:45,926 --> 00:19:51,251
disease you know these things are very hard to nail down. I definitely have fibromyalgia which

354
00:19:51,251 --> 00:19:56,816
essentially means my body is super good at feeling pain. Long story short I'm in some kind of pain

355
00:19:56,816 --> 00:20:00,939
every day all day. Here's some fun facts about debilitating pain.

356
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:05,992
Maybe that's a little melodramatic,

357
00:20:05,992 --> 00:20:08,374
but I totally feel what this guy's saying.

358
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,096
And based on NIH statistics, I'm not alone.

359
00:20:11,096 --> 00:20:12,957
Pain affects more Americans than diabetes,

360
00:20:12,957 --> 00:20:14,698
heart disease, and cancer combined.

361
00:20:14,698 --> 00:20:18,161
One in four Americans have chronic pain.

362
00:20:18,161 --> 00:20:20,883
This is the Wong-Baker pain scale.

363
00:20:20,883 --> 00:20:22,704
It's a way to communicate and track pain.

364
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:24,485
On the left is someone with no pain at all.

365
00:20:24,485 --> 00:20:27,067
On the right is the worst pain you've ever felt.

366
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:28,828
Honestly, none of these people look like

367
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,950
they're any kind of mood I would ever wanna be in.

368
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,070
Oh.

369
00:20:33,685 --> 00:20:35,126
Who wants to be in number zero?

370
00:20:35,126 --> 00:20:42,293
But you might not be familiar with this because 75% of you have probably never experienced

371
00:20:42,293 --> 00:20:44,235
chronic pain.

372
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:45,216
That blows my mind.

373
00:20:45,216 --> 00:20:49,460
I can't speak for others, but the best day I can hope for is about a two, which isn't

374
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,203
a lot better than it used to be, but it's still there.

375
00:20:52,203 --> 00:20:54,965
Pain is constantly vying for my attention.

376
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:56,367
It's constantly barking at me.

377
00:20:57,027 --> 00:21:01,637
Sometimes you can tune it out, sometimes it's just piling on other stresses you got going on.

378
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:06,667
It's like, a lot like when you get a skill in a game that reserves a portion of your mana bar.

379
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,010
Yeah, we play games, I know.

380
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:12,750
You have a lower reserve of energy to just spend on tasks.

381
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:16,971
There's another permutation of this you may have heard of called Spoon Theory.

382
00:21:16,971 --> 00:21:20,592
You can Google that to get more information.

383
00:21:20,592 --> 00:21:25,533
Essentially, it's a way to impart to otherwise healthy people what daily life is like for

384
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,354
people with diseases that don't go away.

385
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:30,915
So what does this have to do with video games?

386
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,196
Trying to play video games in the hospital.

387
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:36,811
made very clear, some UI and gameplay concepts

388
00:21:36,811 --> 00:21:37,852
very clearly stand out,

389
00:21:37,852 --> 00:21:40,174
is being bad for people with pain problems.

390
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,716
It also struck me that some design decisions

391
00:21:42,716 --> 00:21:44,778
that are good for people with pain problems

392
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:48,522
kinda correspond with just good game feel, good UI design.

393
00:21:48,522 --> 00:21:52,426
So here's some thoughts on making it more accessible.

394
00:21:52,426 --> 00:21:56,710
Hard to close windows, tiny ad windows on iOS are the worst.

395
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:13,501
didn't think that was going to be a applause line. But when

396
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:16,724
everything hurts, uh, fine motor control is more difficult. Uh,

397
00:22:16,724 --> 00:22:19,906
this isn't to say you should remove or smooth over anything

398
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:22,648
that needs fine motor control, but you can certainly limit tiny

399
00:22:22,648 --> 00:22:25,591
Xs on mobile touchy screens and stuff. If you think about it

400
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:28,854
though, you kind of already know about painful UI design. These

401
00:22:28,854 --> 00:22:32,056
video ads are designed to be painful because it makes them

402
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:35,559
harder to ignore. There's a good reason the X is as far away from

403
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,821
your thumb as possible. Um, so just.

404
00:22:38,141 --> 00:22:43,565
Think about that power you have to cause people pain, even if it's just a little bit.

405
00:22:43,565 --> 00:22:47,788
Slow opening menus, unskippable cutscenes, dialogue.

406
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:50,170
When a chunk of your attention bar is depleted already,

407
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,452
you have a smaller reserve of attention to work with.

408
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:55,574
That spinny, crazy animation on the menu looks so cool,

409
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:59,297
but trust me when I say that long menu animations and unskippable cutscenes...

410
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:04,480
go from annoying to deal-breaking. When I'm flaring up, my skin is red, all my joints are hot and achy.

411
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,482
I'm just trying to escape from my body for a minute, man. Don't make me watch these intros

412
00:23:08,482 --> 00:23:13,885
and cutscenes and menu animations over and over again. I have limited time until my body gives

413
00:23:13,885 --> 00:23:24,311
out, and I want to play your game. I accidentally closed the app one second. Usability problem.

414
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:27,492
Requiring buttons to be held down to do things.

415
00:23:27,492 --> 00:23:29,353
I don't mean to bash on Destiny specifically,

416
00:23:29,353 --> 00:23:32,354
but it's the most prominent example I could think of.

417
00:23:32,354 --> 00:23:34,235
I understand many game mechanics require you

418
00:23:34,235 --> 00:23:35,215
to hold a button down.

419
00:23:35,215 --> 00:23:36,415
I'm willing to play through that

420
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,436
when it's required by gameplay.

421
00:23:38,436 --> 00:23:39,536
But whenever you enter your skin hurts

422
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:40,957
and your finger joints are cranking,

423
00:23:40,957 --> 00:23:42,797
it's just another UI hurdle that reminds me

424
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:43,898
of my body don't work so good.

425
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:46,220
Inconsistent escape toggle buttons.

426
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,522
When you have to press I to get to the inventory.

427
00:23:49,522 --> 00:23:51,684
Escape to get out, but escape doesn't always get you out.

428
00:23:51,684 --> 00:23:53,325
When the key presses are all over the place

429
00:23:53,325 --> 00:23:55,266
and not consistent, these repetitive motions

430
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:58,508
get gnarly real quick.

431
00:23:58,508 --> 00:24:00,209
I would like to conclude by telling you a little bit

432
00:24:00,209 --> 00:24:01,770
about my grandma Darlene.

433
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:06,113
This was last year at my wedding, we put her into VR.

434
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:09,415
Bottom of the ocean in space.

435
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:10,976
Took her to her hometown in Illinois,

436
00:24:10,976 --> 00:24:12,998
she hadn't seen in 60 years in Google Earth VR.

437
00:24:13,975 --> 00:24:16,317
It was quite a challenge to help her interact with things.

438
00:24:16,317 --> 00:24:17,717
It would have been much easier for us

439
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:19,298
if there were external controls I could help with,

440
00:24:19,298 --> 00:24:20,559
one-handed operation modes.

441
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,440
Grandma, she passed away last month

442
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,582
and she had even expressed interest in playing Stardew Valley

443
00:24:26,582 --> 00:24:28,203
if she wasn't in so much pain.

444
00:24:28,203 --> 00:24:29,784
And I tried to think about how easy

445
00:24:29,784 --> 00:24:31,205
that would have been for her

446
00:24:31,205 --> 00:24:33,686
with her painful hands and controller interactions.

447
00:24:33,686 --> 00:24:35,807
What could have been done to give her a chance to play?

448
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,628
I think there's so many people out there

449
00:24:37,628 --> 00:24:40,189
who want to play our games, but they can't

450
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:42,511
because of UI quirk or hasty UI decision.

451
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:47,030
we just try and be cognizant of that when we design maybe it

452
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:50,313
might open our game up to a wider audience and make it

453
00:24:50,313 --> 00:24:52,935
easier for our existing audience to enjoy them. Thank you.

454
00:24:52,935 --> 00:25:08,607
>>[Applause and cheers from the audience.]

455
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,348
Thank you, Danny. All right.

456
00:25:16,126 --> 00:25:28,218
Please welcome, Adrielle.

457
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,612
I'm Yadriel Wallach, I'm an independent game developer.

458
00:25:32,612 --> 00:25:38,056
I'm most well known for having once made one new game every week for an entire year, as

459
00:25:38,056 --> 00:25:41,958
well as being the creator and organizer of Train Jam, an annual game jam that is on a

460
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:42,258
train.

461
00:25:42,258 --> 00:25:45,140
It goes from Chicago to San Francisco every year.

462
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:53,126
I oftentimes describe my life as a series of tweets that I took too seriously, which

463
00:25:53,126 --> 00:25:56,388
sounds silly and overly simplistic, but it has this weird little element of truth to

464
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,429
it.

465
00:25:57,429 --> 00:25:59,850
To explain what I mean, I'm going to show my two favorite examples.

466
00:26:00,702 --> 00:26:03,063
This is a tweet I made in 2015.

467
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:04,163
I was watching Games Done Quick,

468
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:06,084
which is a super great charity stream.

469
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:08,065
It's a week-long thing where a bunch of speed runners

470
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:10,845
get together and they speed run games, they raise money.

471
00:26:10,845 --> 00:26:11,646
It's super amazing.

472
00:26:11,646 --> 00:26:14,066
If you've never watched it, I would highly recommend it.

473
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:15,847
I was watching it, it was great, and I was like,

474
00:26:15,847 --> 00:26:18,368
man, I really want to do this, but slow.

475
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,708
That'd be super fun.

476
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,949
It was just a totally flippant tweet.

477
00:26:21,949 --> 00:26:26,070
Then my good friend, Teddy Deif, took me slightly seriously,

478
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,671
and then we picked a weekend.

479
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:30,812
And long story short, we made a website and a Twitch channel,

480
00:26:30,812 --> 00:26:32,373
and now we've raised over $43,000 for charity

481
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:32,993
over three years.

482
00:26:32,993 --> 00:26:33,093
Yay.

483
00:26:33,093 --> 00:26:34,073
It's called Square Bowl.

484
00:26:34,073 --> 00:26:41,616
It happens over Super Bowl weekend every year.

485
00:26:41,616 --> 00:26:42,797
That's that.

486
00:26:42,797 --> 00:26:45,958
And then this one is my personal favorite.

487
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:48,959
So I took a train ride once from Boston to Chicago, Chicago

488
00:26:48,959 --> 00:26:50,900
to Seattle, and then Seattle to Vancouver.

489
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:52,294
It was a really long train ride.

490
00:26:52,294 --> 00:26:53,075
It was really fun.

491
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:55,057
And about halfway through the first day,

492
00:26:55,057 --> 00:26:58,721
I tweeted with a lot of typos, 12 hours in

493
00:26:58,721 --> 00:27:00,222
and being on a train is awesome.

494
00:27:00,222 --> 00:27:03,065
Thinking of organizing an indie train next year.

495
00:27:03,065 --> 00:27:04,867
Just keep picking up indies across the US.

496
00:27:05,806 --> 00:27:10,671
Two months later, don't get derailed, go to GC, all aboard the train jam and that was

497
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:11,371
the first train jam.

498
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:14,574
Which then four months later was this.

499
00:27:14,574 --> 00:27:16,256
It was 60 people I had crammed on a train.

500
00:27:16,256 --> 00:27:17,878
We made some games.

501
00:27:17,878 --> 00:27:21,161
The next year was 120 people I had put on a train.

502
00:27:22,222 --> 00:27:26,025
The next year, it was raining, so we had to take this photo inside, but this is 200 people

503
00:27:26,025 --> 00:27:27,305
who went on a train.

504
00:27:27,305 --> 00:27:30,848
This was the first year that we needed to have a drone to take the group photo.

505
00:27:30,848 --> 00:27:32,989
This is 300 people.

506
00:27:32,989 --> 00:27:35,491
It's also the first year I'd rented out an entire train.

507
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:41,916
And then most recently, this was this year, 340 people, which now brings our grand total

508
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:46,319
of participants to over 1,000 people and over 12,000 miles, or 19,000 kilometers traveled

509
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,840
across those five years.

510
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,361
And that's something that I've learned to embrace over the years, you know, follow these

511
00:27:56,361 --> 00:27:58,622
random things that just sort of spark my interest.

512
00:27:58,622 --> 00:28:03,784
Because as you can tell, I've never really known what I wanted to do with my life.

513
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:05,965
I once knew somebody who knew what they wanted to do with their life.

514
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:09,786
He had this plan and, you know, he picked a job career when he was like six years old.

515
00:28:09,786 --> 00:28:13,508
Every decision he made in his life was towards that life goal.

516
00:28:13,508 --> 00:28:17,229
And, you know, what is it, 26 years later, he's now doing that thing he wanted to be

517
00:28:17,229 --> 00:28:18,790
when he was six.

518
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,991
And what I wanted to be when I was six was a mailbox.

519
00:28:22,725 --> 00:28:25,011
Like, not a mail carrier, not a post office worker.

520
00:28:25,011 --> 00:28:26,173
Like, I wanted it to be a mailbox.

521
00:28:26,173 --> 00:28:27,296
I was a nosy child.

522
00:28:27,296 --> 00:28:28,939
I wanted to read letters.

523
00:28:28,939 --> 00:28:30,162
I figured that would be legal.

524
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:35,491
So yeah, I've spent a lot of time making plans and breaking them.

525
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:38,915
If you'd asked me five years ago what I'd be doing right now, I'd probably say something like,

526
00:28:38,915 --> 00:28:45,021
living in a suburb with a kid or something and maybe a small business on the side. I don't know.

527
00:28:45,021 --> 00:28:49,226
I definitely probably wouldn't have said on stage at GDC giving a talk

528
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:53,430
after I've just ridden across the country on a train that I rented for the first time.

529
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,874
For the fifth year in a row, bringing hundreds of people together on a train, making a game

530
00:28:57,874 --> 00:28:58,434
to GDC.

531
00:28:58,434 --> 00:29:03,879
Oh, also in those five years, I got married and moved to another country, and I run a

532
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:09,945
charity stream, and I've been invited to speak at places, and I know the people that I've

533
00:29:09,945 --> 00:29:11,326
looked up to for years in my industry.

534
00:29:11,326 --> 00:29:12,807
That's not a big old brag.

535
00:29:12,807 --> 00:29:17,712
All these things, pretty much 80% of them probably weren't even on my realm of...

536
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:22,335
things that I thought I could even possibly be achieving.

537
00:29:22,335 --> 00:29:25,457
You know, because there was this long period of my life where, you know, this was my life

538
00:29:25,457 --> 00:29:25,637
plan.

539
00:29:25,637 --> 00:29:28,038
You know, I had a goal and I'd go towards that goal and, you know, whatever.

540
00:29:28,038 --> 00:29:29,399
You know, I didn't really think about it.

541
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:31,481
I was just like, this is what I have to do.

542
00:29:31,481 --> 00:29:34,923
This is what a normal human does, so I'm going to do that normal human thing.

543
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:37,825
And I knew deep down that I wasn't really happy and I was super unsatisfied, but I figured

544
00:29:37,825 --> 00:29:39,846
that's just how being an adult was going to work for me.

545
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:40,506
You know, whatever.

546
00:29:40,506 --> 00:29:41,007
I just...

547
00:29:41,307 --> 00:29:42,767
I'll just be unhappy forever, that's fine.

548
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:45,548
There's other people out there who are happy

549
00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:47,748
with what they do, so I should just figure out

550
00:29:47,748 --> 00:29:48,789
how to deal with it.

551
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:50,969
And it wasn't really until I started exposing myself

552
00:29:50,969 --> 00:29:53,230
to other people and experiences and places

553
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,030
and conferences and cultures and everything

554
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,891
that I started sort of examining my life plan

555
00:29:56,891 --> 00:29:59,152
and being like, oh, I discovered which parts

556
00:29:59,152 --> 00:30:01,452
of my life I could throw away, which parts I liked,

557
00:30:01,452 --> 00:30:03,073
which parts I wanted to keep, which parts

558
00:30:03,073 --> 00:30:04,273
weren't working and everything.

559
00:30:04,273 --> 00:30:06,714
And I started viewing all of my plans more fluid

560
00:30:06,714 --> 00:30:09,054
and sort of allowing myself to get swept away

561
00:30:09,054 --> 00:30:10,095
by the things that I wanted to do.

562
00:30:10,855 --> 00:30:13,957
but weren't part of the plan and all that kind of good stuff.

563
00:30:13,957 --> 00:30:16,679
And that's when I finally started feeling happy

564
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:19,221
and I was excited with the people I was associating with

565
00:30:19,221 --> 00:30:22,023
and the stuff that I was doing and the way my life was moving

566
00:30:22,023 --> 00:30:23,303
and that's not times to say,

567
00:30:23,303 --> 00:30:25,945
it's not like I'm not ever unsatisfied,

568
00:30:25,945 --> 00:30:27,766
but that's a normal human kind of unsatisfied

569
00:30:27,766 --> 00:30:28,447
that we all sort of feel

570
00:30:28,447 --> 00:30:29,708
because we're all weird and complicated.

571
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,043
But the point I want to make is that it wasn't me throwing my life plans out the window and

572
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:38,165
turning into a person that's all like fluid and undefined.

573
00:30:38,165 --> 00:30:39,606
That's not the part that made me happy.

574
00:30:39,606 --> 00:30:42,708
The part that made me happy was the fact that I learned to examine the trajectory of my

575
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:46,411
life and adjust to new interests and experiences that made me happier.

576
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:49,573
You know, if you have a plan, you end up exactly where you're going, cool.

577
00:30:49,573 --> 00:30:50,894
That's great.

578
00:30:50,894 --> 00:30:54,417
If you have a plan and you discard it and you make a new plan and then you sort of like

579
00:30:54,417 --> 00:30:56,178
turn that around and do all sorts of other things.

580
00:30:56,838 --> 00:30:57,819
That's also great too.

581
00:30:57,819 --> 00:31:00,502
The point is to check in with yourself

582
00:31:00,502 --> 00:31:02,343
and take life in small chunks of time

583
00:31:02,343 --> 00:31:03,784
and try your hardest to see that you're still

584
00:31:03,784 --> 00:31:05,846
heading towards the direction that you wanna be heading

585
00:31:05,846 --> 00:31:07,327
and make adjustments if you can and you want to.

586
00:31:07,327 --> 00:31:08,668
That's sort of all I really wanted to say.

587
00:31:08,668 --> 00:31:09,069
Thank you.

588
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:10,030
Thank you.

589
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,310
Thank you.

590
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,610
Thank you.

591
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:10,910
Thank you.

592
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,190
Thank you.

593
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,511
Thank you.

594
00:31:11,511 --> 00:31:11,771
Thank you.

595
00:31:11,771 --> 00:31:11,951
Thank you.

596
00:31:11,951 --> 00:31:12,131
Thank you.

597
00:31:12,131 --> 00:31:22,060
Thank you.

598
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,260
Thank you.

599
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,481
Awesome, thank you, Adriel.

600
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:23,581
Okay.

601
00:31:29,502 --> 00:31:36,825
Please welcome Justin.

602
00:31:36,825 --> 00:31:38,546
So hi, my name is Justin Ma.

603
00:31:38,546 --> 00:31:40,327
I'm co-founder of Subset Games.

604
00:31:40,327 --> 00:31:42,808
This is Final Fantasy Tactics.

605
00:31:42,808 --> 00:31:45,169
It is one of my all-time favorite games.

606
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:49,410
In it, your units can learn a ton of abilities from a variety of classes and eventually make

607
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,631
your ideal fighting squad.

608
00:31:51,466 --> 00:31:53,086
Here is one type of skill within the game,

609
00:31:53,086 --> 00:31:54,367
the support abilities.

610
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:58,248
However, when I play the game, this is all that I see.

611
00:31:58,248 --> 00:32:01,069
Today I'm gonna be talking about a mental flaw that I have,

612
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:02,930
which I will be calling min-maxing.

613
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,730
So this skill is called JP Boost.

614
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:08,511
It increases the class experience points gained by 50%.

615
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:11,032
Whenever I play, I feel I have no choice

616
00:32:11,032 --> 00:32:13,733
but to use this skill on every single character,

617
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:16,894
no matter how useful the other skills are,

618
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:19,095
how much I don't want to use this skill.

619
00:32:19,495 --> 00:32:23,118
I'm helpless against my need to reduce grinding and optimize my time.

620
00:32:23,118 --> 00:32:28,421
For me, the inclusion of this skill removed potential interesting play styles, made me

621
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:32,804
feel guilty when I wanted to experiment, and in a general sense, slightly decreased my

622
00:32:32,804 --> 00:32:33,784
enjoyment of the game.

623
00:32:33,784 --> 00:32:38,647
What I'm calling min-maxing is pretty similar to other gaming neuroses.

624
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:39,348
For example...

625
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:42,014
needing to search every single hallway of a JRPG

626
00:32:42,014 --> 00:32:44,795
despite having a thousand elixirs,

627
00:32:44,795 --> 00:32:46,516
feeling compelled to collect everything

628
00:32:46,516 --> 00:32:50,398
even if it means hours of not having fun,

629
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:51,958
and of course, speed running.

630
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:53,659
It's just, just kidding.

631
00:32:53,659 --> 00:32:57,701
Um, moving on, I believe that the term min-maxing

632
00:32:57,701 --> 00:33:00,502
originally came from D&D and RPGs

633
00:33:00,502 --> 00:33:03,063
when you would use math to perfectly optimize a character

634
00:33:03,063 --> 00:33:04,864
for a very specific purpose.

635
00:33:04,864 --> 00:33:06,625
However, I'm using the term to describe

636
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:07,685
something slightly different.

637
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:11,155
In short, the compulsion to do the most optimal play,

638
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,335
even to the detriment of my own enjoyment of the game.

639
00:33:13,335 --> 00:33:17,316
The feeling that forces me to Google best leveling priest

640
00:33:17,316 --> 00:33:20,557
build in Ragnarok Online, the feeling that I simply

641
00:33:20,557 --> 00:33:22,477
have to grind each unit to level 20

642
00:33:22,477 --> 00:33:25,158
before I advance classes in Fire Emblem,

643
00:33:25,158 --> 00:33:28,879
needing to get plus fives in every single level in Oblivion.

644
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:31,039
My problem isn't that you can game the system

645
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,960
by being as efficient as possible.

646
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,160
My problem is when it's specifically not fun to do so.

647
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,821
That being said, this compulsion is not always problematic.

648
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:42,581
In MMOs, it's critical to optimize

649
00:33:42,581 --> 00:33:44,862
your combat efficiency for raids.

650
00:33:44,862 --> 00:33:48,883
Some games' primary fun is finding OP combos of skills.

651
00:33:48,883 --> 00:33:50,564
And of course, the severity of this feeling

652
00:33:50,564 --> 00:33:52,264
varies greatly between people.

653
00:33:52,264 --> 00:33:54,065
Some people can ignore JP boost.

654
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:56,085
I wouldn't grind crew levels in FTL,

655
00:33:56,085 --> 00:33:58,526
though some people feel the need to do so

656
00:33:58,526 --> 00:34:00,427
if they have the opportunity.

657
00:34:00,427 --> 00:34:02,327
So when does min-maxing become a problem?

658
00:34:02,985 --> 00:34:04,626
First, when the interesting mechanics

659
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,387
are much less time efficient.

660
00:34:06,387 --> 00:34:08,808
As I get older and have less time to devote to games,

661
00:34:08,808 --> 00:34:09,928
if I'm forced to make a choice

662
00:34:09,928 --> 00:34:11,649
between an interesting mechanic

663
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:13,910
and something that lets me achieve my goals quicker,

664
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,151
I almost always will take the quicker one

665
00:34:16,151 --> 00:34:16,811
out of pure practicality.

666
00:34:16,811 --> 00:34:18,912
In reality, the amount of time saved

667
00:34:18,912 --> 00:34:20,252
could be pretty minimal,

668
00:34:20,252 --> 00:34:23,534
but this psychological burden is very hard for me to ignore.

669
00:34:23,534 --> 00:34:25,595
My next problem is when single-player games

670
00:34:25,595 --> 00:34:28,796
have a very strong positive feedback loop.

671
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,948
The obvious example is an option to increase experience

672
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:35,553
or resources gained by investing in this early

673
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:37,537
and leveling in an optimal way.

674
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:41,636
You can sort of outpace the difficulty scaling in the game.

675
00:34:41,636 --> 00:34:44,577
Besides feeling like I'm forced to pick these options,

676
00:34:44,577 --> 00:34:46,658
they often end up decreasing the difficulty

677
00:34:46,658 --> 00:34:48,278
in the later stages of the game.

678
00:34:48,278 --> 00:34:50,379
The period when you already understand the mechanics

679
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,580
and would benefit from greater challenge

680
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,821
often ends up being the easiest part.

681
00:34:54,821 --> 00:34:57,141
Solving the game can feel fun, but in practice,

682
00:34:57,141 --> 00:34:59,522
it often means that I lose interest during the climax.

683
00:34:59,522 --> 00:35:01,723
No, it can still be fun.

684
00:35:01,723 --> 00:35:06,345
I enjoy Plants vs. Zombies, but literally every single level,

685
00:35:06,345 --> 00:35:07,525
I will do the same strategy.

686
00:35:08,302 --> 00:35:11,103
Speaking of which, the third problem I've found

687
00:35:11,103 --> 00:35:13,525
is having an optimal strategy.

688
00:35:13,525 --> 00:35:16,486
In advanced wars, I could come up with a brilliant tactic

689
00:35:16,486 --> 00:35:18,767
to counter the enemy's composition,

690
00:35:18,767 --> 00:35:20,207
or I could just build mech infantry

691
00:35:20,207 --> 00:35:22,969
and gradually take over the whole map.

692
00:35:22,969 --> 00:35:25,650
When a single strategy seems effective in every situation

693
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,731
and there's a heavy penalty for failure,

694
00:35:27,731 --> 00:35:29,852
such as losing an hour's progress,

695
00:35:29,852 --> 00:35:32,513
I feel like I'm disincentivized from trying anything new.

696
00:35:34,348 --> 00:35:36,969
To summarize, for people like me,

697
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:39,149
finding a way to optimize the game

698
00:35:39,149 --> 00:35:40,310
can be an enjoyable challenge,

699
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,170
but it can also feel like a curse

700
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,571
that results in me having less choice as a player,

701
00:35:44,571 --> 00:35:48,212
taking fewer risks, and theoretically having less fun.

702
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,773
It's not critical to avoid these min-maxing traps

703
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:54,294
in all games, but if you wanna help protect me from myself,

704
00:35:54,294 --> 00:35:56,255
here are a few things to stay away from.

705
00:35:56,255 --> 00:36:00,296
Try to avoid increases resources gained mechanics

706
00:36:00,296 --> 00:36:01,917
unless they're completely necessary.

707
00:36:02,684 --> 00:36:05,065
Try to prevent there being an optimal play style.

708
00:36:05,065 --> 00:36:06,545
If a single strategy works every time,

709
00:36:06,545 --> 00:36:08,986
there's no incentive for growth.

710
00:36:08,986 --> 00:36:10,326
Don't force the player to choose

711
00:36:10,326 --> 00:36:12,407
between fun and time efficiency.

712
00:36:12,407 --> 00:36:14,027
It's just not even a choice for me.

713
00:36:14,027 --> 00:36:17,388
Our games are certainly not perfect in this regard,

714
00:36:17,388 --> 00:36:19,309
but I've found that this lens of,

715
00:36:19,309 --> 00:36:21,610
will the player feel like they have no choice

716
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,550
but to do this, is a helpful tool

717
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,391
when trying to find the fun gameplay loops in our games.

718
00:36:26,391 --> 00:36:28,012
Thank you very much.

719
00:36:37,606 --> 00:36:43,396
Thank you, Justin.

720
00:36:43,396 --> 00:36:47,984
Please welcome Dee.

721
00:36:54,403 --> 00:36:58,886
Hi! A few things off the top. I'm going to make this talk as optimistic as possible.

722
00:36:58,886 --> 00:37:04,690
I've tried to include as many existing and recent examples from the indie game scene as possible

723
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,772
to show what it looks like when things are working, in my opinion, but at times it dips

724
00:37:07,772 --> 00:37:14,517
into industry examples. Okay. This talk is going to be about me! Ha! So it's important for me to

725
00:37:14,517 --> 00:37:19,700
start with who I am, especially for those of you in the back, this is my face.

726
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:24,828
I'm Dee. I'm a femme person. My pronouns are they, them, she, her. I grew up in Chicago,

727
00:37:24,828 --> 00:37:28,050
Illinois, in the States. I now live in Seattle, Washington.

728
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:35,676
Rock on. I used to be a fedora kid. My senior quote in the yearbook in high school was a quote

729
00:37:35,676 --> 00:37:41,220
from a goofy robot anime. I really like the color purple in mustaches, and I've been working in

730
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:47,864
video game communities for the past few years. I got kind of a goofy smile in this one.

731
00:37:47,864 --> 00:37:49,686
Okay, cool. You all know me and who I am.

732
00:37:50,586 --> 00:37:54,629
So this is me, and this is what I want you to think of me.

733
00:37:54,629 --> 00:37:56,490
Target me.

734
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,611
Make me your target audience.

735
00:37:57,611 --> 00:38:03,876
If you are a creator of games, systems, design, communities,

736
00:38:03,876 --> 00:38:06,498
writing, journalism, as an indie who is not beholden

737
00:38:06,498 --> 00:38:07,359
to stakeholders, target me.

738
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,161
Hire a diversity consultant and make me your target audience.

739
00:38:11,161 --> 00:38:12,402
This is a cool.

740
00:38:12,402 --> 00:38:12,703
Oh, oops.

741
00:38:12,703 --> 00:38:13,043
OK, there we go.

742
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:13,423
Cool.

743
00:38:20,603 --> 00:38:26,465
I have dark skin and character generators make my brown skin the normalized choice.

744
00:38:26,465 --> 00:38:31,827
When I open your character generator, make brown skin one of the first things I see.

745
00:38:31,827 --> 00:38:34,668
I don't want to scroll through to find brown skin.

746
00:38:34,668 --> 00:38:35,628
Target me.

747
00:38:35,628 --> 00:38:37,249
I'm a second generation immigrant.

748
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:38,169
I'm Filipino-American.

749
00:38:38,169 --> 00:38:42,731
I will never be accepted as Filipino or as American fully.

750
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:44,411
I'm third culture.

751
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:45,011
Target me.

752
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:51,143
I grew up in a so-called system of meritocracy and have dealt with a lack of self-worth and

753
00:38:51,143 --> 00:38:54,824
unhealthy relationship with my value as a person my entire life.

754
00:38:54,824 --> 00:38:57,266
If you make digital interactives, target me.

755
00:38:57,266 --> 00:39:02,889
I have a non-traditional relationship with my body, especially with regards to my appearance

756
00:39:02,889 --> 00:39:04,369
and presentation.

757
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:06,170
Target me.

758
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:11,313
If I want to enforce the pronouns they-them, I want a game and system that does so respectfully.

759
00:39:11,313 --> 00:39:12,273
Target me.

760
00:39:13,574 --> 00:39:18,937
I live in a political context that makes my lived experience much more arduous than is

761
00:39:18,937 --> 00:39:21,959
validated by the larger communities that surround and encompass me.

762
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:26,021
Yet, I choose to be optimistic and hopeful as hell.

763
00:39:26,021 --> 00:39:27,782
Target me.

764
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:31,003
Target me in such a way that my existence is not a punchline.

765
00:39:31,003 --> 00:39:34,505
It's great when the jokes I make are a punchline.

766
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:40,068
I'm sometimes funny, but don't make my existence or attributes a punchline.

767
00:39:41,637 --> 00:39:44,199
Yes, I acknowledge the possibilities.

768
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:45,940
When I use the phrase, target me,

769
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,441
make me the target audience of your creation,

770
00:39:48,441 --> 00:39:51,163
an individual can take this and ask,

771
00:39:51,163 --> 00:39:52,824
can I make money off of me?

772
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:54,505
Can I make money off of you?

773
00:39:54,505 --> 00:39:58,648
Can you use me as a mental or creative exercise

774
00:39:58,648 --> 00:39:59,108
for a few games?

775
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:03,011
And that's a little weird if I think about it too hard,

776
00:40:03,011 --> 00:40:05,432
but yes, I acknowledge those possibilities.

777
00:40:06,522 --> 00:40:10,403
But my favorite possibility that you can take away from this talk is,

778
00:40:10,403 --> 00:40:13,485
can you make me excited with your next creation?

779
00:40:13,485 --> 00:40:17,367
Can you make me feel excited, like as excited as I was the first time

780
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:20,828
I felt like I belonged when I moderated MMORPG forums?

781
00:40:20,828 --> 00:40:25,130
For this possibility, I invite you to target me.

782
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:28,152
Lastly, target my students.

783
00:40:28,863 --> 00:40:31,804
I teach programming to folks in the gender diverse population

784
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:36,686
who are career changers as adults into the tech industry.

785
00:40:36,686 --> 00:40:39,807
For the interested students, I teach them about game making.

786
00:40:39,807 --> 00:40:42,868
Every day that I teach them, I am

787
00:40:42,868 --> 00:40:45,909
reminded of how they were prevented or invalidated

788
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:48,890
from going into tech or games programming growing up

789
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,271
and that they are hungry for it now.

790
00:40:51,271 --> 00:40:52,592
I'm reminded of all the folks who

791
00:40:52,592 --> 00:40:54,592
want to play games that target them

792
00:40:54,592 --> 00:40:55,873
and haven't found those games.

793
00:40:57,274 --> 00:41:00,997
So yes, make games for yourself, make games for your friends,

794
00:41:00,997 --> 00:41:03,418
make games for your needs.

795
00:41:03,418 --> 00:41:07,441
But when you can, consider hiring a diversity consultant

796
00:41:07,441 --> 00:41:09,002
and making a game that targets me.

797
00:41:09,002 --> 00:41:11,904
Thank you to all the games that have

798
00:41:11,904 --> 00:41:13,265
and continue to target me.

799
00:41:13,265 --> 00:41:16,087
Final notes before my time is up.

800
00:41:16,087 --> 00:41:18,549
Use them in your reading and speaking.

801
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:20,030
Elevate your moderators.

802
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:21,271
Don't exploit people's traumas.

803
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:22,872
Hire diversity consultants.

804
00:41:22,872 --> 00:41:24,413
Personal health comes first.

805
00:41:24,413 --> 00:41:25,754
You deserve a good quality of life.

806
00:41:25,754 --> 00:41:26,595
Thank you, good night.

807
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:40,729
Thank you, D, that was great.

808
00:41:40,729 --> 00:41:43,370
All right, moving along.

809
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,811
We're on number eight here.

810
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:46,792
Please welcome Frank.

811
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:47,012
All right.

812
00:41:47,012 --> 00:41:47,272
Thank you.

813
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:48,073
Thank you.

814
00:41:48,073 --> 00:41:48,353
Thank you.

815
00:41:48,353 --> 00:41:48,573
Thank you.

816
00:41:48,573 --> 00:41:48,873
Thank you.

817
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:55,377
Thank you.

818
00:41:55,377 --> 00:41:56,637
Hello.

819
00:41:56,637 --> 00:42:01,380
So, yes, in the game that I released last year,

820
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,722
I had a project called the Toth Sausage Conjecture.

821
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:08,604
And about a month later, I received this email.

822
00:42:09,764 --> 00:42:11,726
from Toth's grandson.

823
00:42:11,726 --> 00:42:14,068
He said, how did you know about my grandfather's work?

824
00:42:14,068 --> 00:42:14,828
This is amazing.

825
00:42:14,828 --> 00:42:17,050
How did you know about the sausage conjecture?

826
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:18,051
Are you a mathematician?

827
00:42:18,051 --> 00:42:20,033
Did you find out about it from another colleague at NYU

828
00:42:20,033 --> 00:42:22,234
who had worked with my grandfather?

829
00:42:22,234 --> 00:42:26,298
And I'm definitely not a mathematician,

830
00:42:26,298 --> 00:42:30,461
but I had a nice conversation with Laszlo Toth's grandson,

831
00:42:30,461 --> 00:42:31,862
and he was very excited and happy.

832
00:42:32,363 --> 00:42:34,265
And that made me happy.

833
00:42:34,265 --> 00:42:38,870
And so I thought I would spend my five minutes on the soapbox

834
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:43,395
celebrating the work of this man, Laszlo Fehej-Toth,

835
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:48,441
and maybe giving just a brief explanation of the Toth-Sausage conjecture.

836
00:42:49,681 --> 00:42:53,183
First of all, there are a couple other famous Laszlo Toths.

837
00:42:53,183 --> 00:43:00,507
One of them was a Hungarian geologist who thought that he was Jesus Christ and vandalized

838
00:43:00,507 --> 00:43:00,867
the Pieta.

839
00:43:00,867 --> 00:43:07,210
The other one was a fictional character created by the comedian Don Novello, who wrote funny

840
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,231
letters to celebrities and politicians.

841
00:43:10,072 --> 00:43:13,653
But this is the Laszlo Toth that we are here to talk about.

842
00:43:13,653 --> 00:43:21,476
Laszlo Fehez Toth, a Hungarian mathematician who was someone who worked in the sort of

843
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:23,176
higher order geometry.

844
00:43:23,176 --> 00:43:30,058
He wrote books like Regular Figures, which were full of beautiful images of patterns

845
00:43:30,058 --> 00:43:32,919
and shapes and tiling systems.

846
00:43:32,919 --> 00:43:36,961
And the sausage conjecture is a problem.

847
00:43:37,501 --> 00:43:43,044
in the domain of, sort of in the domain of the sphere packing problems.

848
00:43:43,044 --> 00:43:46,587
And sphere packing problems are problems in geometry

849
00:43:46,587 --> 00:43:53,130
that look at how you can efficiently pack lots of spheres together into a volume.

850
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,192
So it sort of goes back to the 16th century

851
00:43:56,192 --> 00:43:58,634
when people would look at stacks of cannonballs

852
00:43:58,634 --> 00:44:01,876
and wonder is that the most efficient way to arrange cannonballs.

853
00:44:03,097 --> 00:44:10,385
In the case of the sausage conjecture, Toth was looking at ways of wrapping spheres,

854
00:44:10,385 --> 00:44:15,631
and the most efficient way to wrap spheres using the least amount of material.

855
00:44:15,631 --> 00:44:20,497
So in this case, we have a bunch of 2D spheres, which are also called circles.

856
00:44:21,518 --> 00:44:23,359
And so you would look at these and say,

857
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:26,380
what's the most efficient way to wrap these?

858
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,200
So if I'm using string, let's say,

859
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,281
what's the way to arrange these spheres

860
00:44:31,281 --> 00:44:34,283
so that I have to use the least amount of string

861
00:44:34,283 --> 00:44:35,443
in order to wrap them up?

862
00:44:35,443 --> 00:44:37,304
And it turns out that the right way to do it

863
00:44:37,304 --> 00:44:40,225
is to just line them up like this.

864
00:44:40,612 --> 00:44:45,714
right, like a sausage, one after the next in a straight line.

865
00:44:45,714 --> 00:44:47,815
And that's the most efficient way to wrap them

866
00:44:47,815 --> 00:44:48,995
until you get to seven.

867
00:44:48,995 --> 00:44:50,456
Then once you hit seven,

868
00:44:50,456 --> 00:44:52,737
this is actually a slightly more efficient way

869
00:44:52,737 --> 00:44:54,957
to arrange the circles.

870
00:44:54,957 --> 00:44:57,278
So what about spheres?

871
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:59,139
Well, in the case of spheres,

872
00:44:59,139 --> 00:45:00,540
the same thing holds true, right?

873
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:03,141
You'd line them up just like a sausage, end to end.

874
00:45:03,141 --> 00:45:06,422
There you go, all the way up until you hit 56.

875
00:45:06,682 --> 00:45:13,563
And then at 56, all of a sudden, this becomes the most efficient way to arrange them, right?

876
00:45:13,563 --> 00:45:17,244
And you might ask yourself, what about a 3-sphere, right?

877
00:45:17,244 --> 00:45:19,724
What about a hypersphere in 4 dimensions?

878
00:45:19,724 --> 00:45:28,546
And it turns out that, yes, just as you might expect, somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000,

879
00:45:28,546 --> 00:45:35,687
we're not sure where, but there's a spot where it becomes more efficient.

880
00:45:36,147 --> 00:45:37,067
to not arrange them.

881
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:40,228
But up through the first 50,000 for sure, you should just line them up.

882
00:45:40,228 --> 00:45:46,009
I don't know how to gesture in 4D space, but you line them up like this.

883
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:51,371
But then at some point, there's some other arrangement that is more efficient.

884
00:45:51,371 --> 00:45:56,132
And so you might think now this is going to continue, right?

885
00:45:56,132 --> 00:45:59,353
And in the higher dimensions, in five dimensions, in six dimensions, in seven dimensions, you're

886
00:45:59,353 --> 00:46:03,413
always going to see something like this where first you want to line them all up like this

887
00:46:03,413 --> 00:46:05,874
and then at a certain point, there becomes a more efficient arrangement.

888
00:46:06,755 --> 00:46:09,097
But Toth disagreed.

889
00:46:09,097 --> 00:46:18,084
So Toth's theory was that starting at five dimensions, it's always most efficient to

890
00:46:18,084 --> 00:46:21,387
line them up in a sausage, and it never changes.

891
00:46:21,387 --> 00:46:23,849
So that is the sausage conjecture.

892
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:29,173
For dimensions five and above, the sausage arrangement is always optimal, no matter how

893
00:46:29,173 --> 00:46:31,055
many spheres that you are wrapping.

894
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:38,961
So, as it turns out, we know for a fact that this is true for dimensions of 42 and above.

895
00:46:38,961 --> 00:46:41,663
That has been proven.

896
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:46,427
Everything between 4 and 42, we don't know, but we think he's probably right.

897
00:46:46,427 --> 00:46:47,448
That's what a conjecture is, right?

898
00:46:48,669 --> 00:46:56,055
And so that is the the toss sausage conjecture and just as as an example of of what is kind of interesting about this

899
00:46:56,055 --> 00:47:02,640
It's relevant to cryptography and code. So if you're for example, if you're designing a language

900
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:08,625
Sphere packing problems are actually really relevant to that because you want to pack as many words as you can

901
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:13,489
Into your language space, but you also want them to be as far apart as they can be

902
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:20,916
So that if you're sending a message over a noisy channel, the receiver has the best chance of interpreting each symbol correctly.

903
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:25,399
And so that is the TOTH sausage conjecture. Thank you.

904
00:47:25,399 --> 00:47:41,653
I bet you didn't think you were going to learn about multi-dimensional sausages today.

905
00:47:43,533 --> 00:47:44,454
Thank you, Frank.

906
00:47:44,454 --> 00:47:57,423
Please welcome our next speaker, Rosa.

907
00:47:57,423 --> 00:47:58,564
Hello, everyone.

908
00:47:58,564 --> 00:47:59,304
I'm Rosa.

909
00:47:59,304 --> 00:48:02,046
I'm a member of the cooperative Digital Liberties

910
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,048
and co-founder of the project Games for the Many.

911
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:06,770
I'm also that speaker that starts

912
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:10,332
making everyone feel a little bit uncomfortable

913
00:48:10,332 --> 00:48:12,934
by bringing politics to a games event.

914
00:48:14,127 --> 00:48:19,769
So, as a Spanish games developer working and living in the United Kingdom, I'm going to

915
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:24,290
start by mentioning a political event that over there was massive.

916
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:25,270
You might have heard about it.

917
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:30,672
The UK decided to leave the European Union in 2016.

918
00:48:30,672 --> 00:48:37,574
The general population voted to leave by about 52% in favor, but 80% of the games industry

919
00:48:37,574 --> 00:48:38,414
didn't want this.

920
00:48:39,224 --> 00:48:43,927
On the day of the result, a bunch of us went to the pub and we'd order drinks and we moped.

921
00:48:43,927 --> 00:48:49,211
And we said, how did we contribute to this debate when all we make is games?

922
00:48:49,211 --> 00:48:55,615
Then last year, a sudden general election was called and the British Labour Party came

923
00:48:55,615 --> 00:48:56,876
knocking to our door.

924
00:48:56,876 --> 00:49:03,000
They wanted us to make a game that would teach people about their campaign pledges in a way

925
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,441
that anyone could understand and engage with.

926
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:10,904
So we kind of took this as an opportunity to stop moping and try to contribute in the

927
00:49:10,904 --> 00:49:12,445
only way we knew how, by making games.

928
00:49:12,445 --> 00:49:17,028
That's how Corbin Run was made.

929
00:49:17,028 --> 00:49:21,371
It's a short arcadey game about what Labour stood for during the election.

930
00:49:21,371 --> 00:49:26,495
You play Jeremy Corbin, who is the leader of the Labour Party, and you chase down tax

931
00:49:26,495 --> 00:49:30,517
dodgers, taking the money they stole and using it to fund campaign pledges.

932
00:49:31,458 --> 00:49:34,320
As you go, people join you until you build up a mass movement.

933
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,341
And together, you overcome the opposing party,

934
00:49:36,341 --> 00:49:37,321
the conservatives.

935
00:49:37,321 --> 00:49:39,182
It's really short.

936
00:49:39,182 --> 00:49:41,584
It's funny, we hope.

937
00:49:41,584 --> 00:49:43,585
We weren't trying to paint a picture of suffering

938
00:49:43,585 --> 00:49:46,466
or make Europa universalis, but rather unpick

939
00:49:46,466 --> 00:49:49,247
the complex web of politics and present it in a way

940
00:49:49,247 --> 00:49:50,468
that anyone could understand.

941
00:49:50,468 --> 00:49:50,828
It went viral.

942
00:49:50,828 --> 00:49:54,550
It was downloaded 150,000 times in one week

943
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:59,252
and was covered across all major media in the UK

944
00:49:59,252 --> 00:50:01,013
and some in Germany and Japan.

945
00:50:01,936 --> 00:50:04,238
we started calling games like ours campaign games,

946
00:50:04,238 --> 00:50:07,300
a child of news games but tied to particular social

947
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,601
or political campaigns.

948
00:50:08,601 --> 00:50:10,863
So this is what we learned.

949
00:50:10,863 --> 00:50:15,207
Firstly, simulation games have a high barrier to engagement.

950
00:50:15,207 --> 00:50:17,849
So much discussion of serious games

951
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:19,290
is centered around what games can do

952
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:21,492
by way of simulating real world systems.

953
00:50:22,063 --> 00:50:23,825
And this can be a valuable approach,

954
00:50:23,825 --> 00:50:26,426
but the key to getting a wide audience to share a game

955
00:50:26,426 --> 00:50:29,168
and making it go viral is that players can understand

956
00:50:29,168 --> 00:50:32,330
and get involved with the game as quickly as possible.

957
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,291
And simulation can be a bit too complicated

958
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:35,732
to allow for this sort of engagement.

959
00:50:35,732 --> 00:50:37,313
So instead.

960
00:50:38,024 --> 00:50:41,208
Pick mechanics which tell the political narrative

961
00:50:41,208 --> 00:50:42,710
you want to communicate.

962
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:45,374
So by combining simple, expressive mechanics

963
00:50:45,374 --> 00:50:46,976
inspired by existing games, we could

964
00:50:46,976 --> 00:50:48,858
create an easily legible, engaging way

965
00:50:48,858 --> 00:50:50,760
to say what we wanted to say.

966
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,884
We got across a rhetorical point that was more abstract,

967
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,046
but also easier to grasp.

968
00:50:56,783 --> 00:50:59,325
Thirdly is that humor helps disarm people who might not

969
00:50:59,325 --> 00:51:00,806
otherwise agree with your point.

970
00:51:00,806 --> 00:51:04,008
And it allows a broader audience to enjoy your game.

971
00:51:04,008 --> 00:51:07,330
We use memes, humor, and caricature to draw people in.

972
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:10,532
And it was this witty tone that why Corbyn Run broke

973
00:51:10,532 --> 00:51:13,054
through filter bubbles and had media pick it up

974
00:51:13,054 --> 00:51:15,736
and even allowed conservatives to play and enjoy it, we hope.

975
00:51:15,736 --> 00:51:19,979
So art has historically been used

976
00:51:19,979 --> 00:51:23,221
as a platform for engaging in political conversation,

977
00:51:23,221 --> 00:51:25,923
from Moralismo Mexicano, The Futurist.

978
00:51:26,446 --> 00:51:28,147
Dada, the situationists.

979
00:51:28,147 --> 00:51:30,588
And while games are not the answer to everything,

980
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:33,049
and neither should they be, I'm not saying that,

981
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:35,791
I think games can and should form a rich new mode

982
00:51:35,791 --> 00:51:39,253
of discourse that allows us to comment on and question

983
00:51:39,253 --> 00:51:42,074
our political landscape in illuminating new ways.

984
00:51:42,074 --> 00:51:45,156
So we're at the beginning of a burgeoning movement

985
00:51:45,156 --> 00:51:46,357
of campaign games.

986
00:51:46,357 --> 00:51:49,538
We have fiscal combat in France, to run Taipei,

987
00:51:49,538 --> 00:51:51,519
and campaign games are on the threshold

988
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:54,381
of having a major impact on political campaigns worldwide.

989
00:51:55,588 --> 00:51:59,591
So we feel proud that Corbyn Run had a real-world impact on British politics,

990
00:51:59,591 --> 00:52:03,173
and we think what we managed to do shows a path forward for developers all over the world

991
00:52:03,173 --> 00:52:07,076
to use games, to participate in political movements.

992
00:52:07,076 --> 00:52:10,698
We believe that by making an impact on the political landscape across the world,

993
00:52:10,698 --> 00:52:15,662
proving that games can be influential as more than just mass popcorn entertainment,

994
00:52:15,662 --> 00:52:18,944
we can earn games a place on the wider cultural table

995
00:52:18,944 --> 00:52:21,345
and chart a richer, more secure future for our medium.

996
00:52:21,345 --> 00:52:21,906
Thank you.

997
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,500
Thank you, Rosa.

998
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,621
Was that Margaret Thatcher's ghost in the game?

999
00:52:35,621 --> 00:52:37,722
Recognize the ghost anywhere.

1000
00:52:37,722 --> 00:52:45,125
All right, please welcome our final speaker, Ethan.

1001
00:52:52,831 --> 00:52:55,495
So I'm here to talk to you today about the brightest future, right?

1002
00:52:55,495 --> 00:53:02,306
It's what I call the moral imperative for trying hard, doing difficult things, and for

1003
00:53:02,306 --> 00:53:05,310
coolness basically, in both aesthetic and modality.

1004
00:53:05,785 --> 00:53:07,186
But before I get too deep into it,

1005
00:53:07,186 --> 00:53:09,387
I just wanna slap a big ol' IMO on this whole thing.

1006
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:11,048
They asked me to give a rant, which was a mistake.

1007
00:53:11,048 --> 00:53:12,910
I intend to give one.

1008
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:15,451
There will be some strong opinions

1009
00:53:15,451 --> 00:53:19,334
and some unsubstantiated claims, so don't at me.

1010
00:53:19,334 --> 00:53:19,994
So yeah, who am I?

1011
00:53:19,994 --> 00:53:21,255
I'm Ethan Redd.

1012
00:53:21,255 --> 00:53:25,258
I'm founder and creative lead of Virtuoso Neo Media.

1013
00:53:25,258 --> 00:53:29,561
We are a new production house focusing on bringing color

1014
00:53:29,561 --> 00:53:33,063
and fun and life-affirming charm to what we create.

1015
00:53:33,484 --> 00:53:37,066
Our current project is Blazing Legion Ignition,

1016
00:53:37,066 --> 00:53:40,228
a first-person shmup drama

1017
00:53:40,228 --> 00:53:43,550
about a four-story tall mecha and consequences.

1018
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:45,411
And just here's some other stuff I've made

1019
00:53:45,411 --> 00:53:47,612
to get a flavor of me.

1020
00:53:47,612 --> 00:53:48,493
But enough about me.

1021
00:53:48,493 --> 00:53:49,974
I'm here to talk to you today

1022
00:53:49,974 --> 00:53:51,175
about like nothing really technical

1023
00:53:51,175 --> 00:53:53,556
or even immediately applicable,

1024
00:53:53,556 --> 00:53:55,037
but I'm here to talk to you about attitude

1025
00:53:55,037 --> 00:53:57,238
and specifically one that I've noticed

1026
00:53:57,238 --> 00:53:59,480
this last maybe two years or so

1027
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,121
that I've playfully dubbed weak wave.

1028
00:54:02,641 --> 00:54:07,644
where it's like this weird demon baby of post-modernism

1029
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:08,625
and can't-doism.

1030
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:11,266
There's so much defeatism.

1031
00:54:11,266 --> 00:54:13,748
We have almost this fetish-type relationship

1032
00:54:13,748 --> 00:54:17,450
with failure, excessive self-deprecation, cynicism,

1033
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,331
and irony for their own sake.

1034
00:54:19,331 --> 00:54:23,274
There's nothing wrong with these traits by themselves.

1035
00:54:23,274 --> 00:54:26,556
But taken together, and as a matter of course, I hate this.

1036
00:54:26,556 --> 00:54:28,397
And it is antithetical to what I think

1037
00:54:28,397 --> 00:54:30,418
art is supposed to do to me.

1038
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,182
And don't get me wrong, it is very difficult to be an optimist in the year of our Lord 2018, right?

1039
00:54:35,182 --> 00:54:41,505
Um, around the world, we are facing so many rich and complicated issues.

1040
00:54:41,505 --> 00:54:45,467
And just look at this country. We have a flaming hot Cheeto for our president.

1041
00:54:45,467 --> 00:54:47,669
We have, we've seen the rise of nationalism.

1042
00:54:47,669 --> 00:54:51,370
Uh, we have almost weekly mass shootings and police brutality.

1043
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:54,572
Uh, we have people drinking lead water, for God's sake, right?

1044
00:54:54,572 --> 00:54:58,194
Um, like, we're facing some really hard stuff.

1045
00:54:58,194 --> 00:55:00,475
It is a very scary time to be alive.

1046
00:55:00,855 --> 00:55:05,417
But that is not why we should crawl into our own shells.

1047
00:55:05,417 --> 00:55:07,518
That is why we should be bold,

1048
00:55:07,518 --> 00:55:10,419
because we are the artists, the thinkers,

1049
00:55:10,419 --> 00:55:12,320
the dreamers of dreams, right?

1050
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:16,421
We paint the cultural landscape that everyone else lives in.

1051
00:55:16,421 --> 00:55:19,322
And the world right now needs inspiration.

1052
00:55:19,322 --> 00:55:20,443
They need to see champions.

1053
00:55:20,443 --> 00:55:21,203
They need heroes.

1054
00:55:21,203 --> 00:55:22,183
They need hope.

1055
00:55:22,735 --> 00:55:27,418
And I think we have a lot to contribute, as artists,

1056
00:55:27,418 --> 00:55:28,158
game makers, whatever.

1057
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:32,621
We need to redefine what we consider possible,

1058
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:34,362
both in our craft and in our own lives,

1059
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:35,603
because people are watching.

1060
00:55:35,603 --> 00:55:38,985
I like the example of Tony Hawk landing the first 900 in 1999.

1061
00:55:38,985 --> 00:55:41,326
It was an impossible trick at the time,

1062
00:55:41,326 --> 00:55:45,269
but has since become standard in vert skating at this level,

1063
00:55:45,269 --> 00:55:47,790
because kids grew up watching him

1064
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:50,172
doing more than what they thought was possible

1065
00:55:50,172 --> 00:55:51,212
and aspired to that level.

1066
00:55:52,033 --> 00:55:59,035
We need to do amazing things because they are difficult and because those kids and our peers are watching.

1067
00:55:59,035 --> 00:56:08,118
We need to bring our best to inspire that in others, like a heroin-addicted kung fu master still looking and seeing potential

1068
00:56:08,118 --> 00:56:13,860
in a young street urchin who would go on to be one of the greatest action filmmakers of his time

1069
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:18,041
and inspire one of the greatest action filmmakers of all time, in my humble opinion.

1070
00:56:21,343 --> 00:56:26,206
We need to aim higher in our own work and in our fictions that we create.

1071
00:56:26,206 --> 00:56:31,189
We all love to rag on Star Trek for how campy, colorful, and weird it was back in the 60s,

1072
00:56:31,189 --> 00:56:31,689
right?

1073
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:34,451
But it dared to ask the question, what if things were better?

1074
00:56:34,451 --> 00:56:35,892
What if we could get along?

1075
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:40,474
What if we could invent solutions to our problems instead of just complaining about them?

1076
00:56:40,474 --> 00:56:44,897
And it inspired civil rights activists like Martin Luther King to technologists like the

1077
00:56:44,897 --> 00:56:47,539
creators of the first cell phones.

1078
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:52,403
home computers that we all use these days, inspired real-world change.

1079
00:56:52,403 --> 00:56:58,789
We have more to contribute to this world than depression memes, samey games,

1080
00:56:58,789 --> 00:57:02,993
and just, like, being sad about stuff.

1081
00:57:02,993 --> 00:57:06,136
Like, it's hard right now, but we can improve things.

1082
00:57:06,136 --> 00:57:10,180
We can inspire people who can make a tangible impact on this world,

1083
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,541
even though our work maybe doesn't.

1084
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,562
We are tomorrow, and I refuse to live in a world

1085
00:57:16,562 --> 00:57:18,663
where that is a step backwards from today.

1086
00:57:18,663 --> 00:57:21,645
I refuse, Virtuoso refuses, and I invite you to as well

1087
00:57:21,645 --> 00:57:23,646
because the future is as bright as we make it.

1088
00:57:23,646 --> 00:57:24,526
Thank you, Forward Forever.

1089
00:57:40,717 --> 00:57:42,738
Wow, thank you Ethan, you crushed it.

1090
00:57:42,738 --> 00:57:45,840
That wraps it up for the Soapbox and the Independent Game Summit.

1091
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:49,302
Please be sure to fill out your feedback forms to let us know how we did,

1092
00:57:49,302 --> 00:57:50,543
and we hope to see you again next year.

1093
00:57:50,543 --> 00:57:53,865
But before we go, let's have one final round of applause for all of our amazing speakers.

1094
00:57:53,865 --> 00:57:54,066
Thank you.
