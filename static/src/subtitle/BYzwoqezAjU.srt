1
00:00:02,754 --> 00:00:06,716
Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:06,716 --> 00:00:07,217
Right.

3
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:09,218
Let's get this started.

4
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:10,719
Hi.

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,982
Welcome to my session for the UX Summit.

6
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:20,566
As you can see on the title slide, it's called Dark Patterns.

7
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:22,507
How good UX can be bad UX.

8
00:00:22,507 --> 00:00:23,367
Yay.

9
00:00:26,127 --> 00:00:32,570
I'm actually really nervous because this is my first time speaking to such a large audience.

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,151
So please bear with me.

11
00:00:34,151 --> 00:00:34,731
Right.

12
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:35,352
So let's start.

13
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:35,492
Hello.

14
00:00:35,492 --> 00:00:35,652
Right.

15
00:00:35,652 --> 00:00:36,172
Hello.

16
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:38,473
Right.

17
00:00:47,274 --> 00:00:52,118
So my name is Anisa Sanusi and I'm actually from Malaysia

18
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:55,241
and I came to the UK eight years ago to study.

19
00:00:55,241 --> 00:01:02,547
And six years ago, I started my career as a 2D animator

20
00:01:02,547 --> 00:01:06,130
in a local animation studio.

21
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:11,034
So we did children's shows, explainer videos

22
00:01:11,034 --> 00:01:12,235
and things like that.

23
00:01:12,235 --> 00:01:14,377
And I studied animation by the way.

24
00:01:14,377 --> 00:01:14,437
So.

25
00:01:15,247 --> 00:01:18,928
I wanted to do animation, but I needed a visa

26
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:20,088
to stay in the UK.

27
00:01:20,088 --> 00:01:22,809
So the only other company hiring

28
00:01:22,809 --> 00:01:25,109
was actually a video games company,

29
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:27,790
and they needed a 2D artist.

30
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,991
So just like that, I changed into a 2D artist.

31
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:36,893
It was funny because they had a art test

32
00:01:36,893 --> 00:01:41,134
that I had to learn a completely new program in one night.

33
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:44,118
and managed to do it.

34
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:47,701
And the lady who hired me thought I was lying

35
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:49,522
when I told her I learned everything in one night.

36
00:01:49,522 --> 00:01:52,384
So the moral of that story is fake it till you make it.

37
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,085
That's how I got here.

38
00:01:53,085 --> 00:01:53,565
So anyway.

39
00:01:58,032 --> 00:02:05,735
That was great and it was in that video games company that I learned what the world of UI is.

40
00:02:05,735 --> 00:02:14,138
I didn't even know that it existed. In uni all I knew was there was 3D artists, there was animators, there was producers, things like that.

41
00:02:14,138 --> 00:02:18,019
But UI was completely new and unknown to me.

42
00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:22,755
So I kind of had to learn from scratch what it was.

43
00:02:22,755 --> 00:02:26,701
Besides, nobody really pays attention to menu screens.

44
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:28,964
I mean, it's a good sign that it's a good menu screen

45
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:30,527
because you didn't notice it, but you know.

46
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:34,713
Right, so for the last...

47
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,062
six years, four years, yeah, four years in the games industry.

48
00:02:39,062 --> 00:02:43,385
I have been lucky enough to be able to work on

49
00:02:43,385 --> 00:02:47,287
a huge amount of different platforms. When I say huge, I mean four.

50
00:02:47,287 --> 00:02:52,589
So there's, I did work on PC, consoles, handheld and mobile.

51
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,351
I was very lucky that the company that I worked for

52
00:02:56,351 --> 00:03:01,474
was very ambitious and adventurous in the platforms that we went for.

53
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:06,014
So I got kind of, I got a finger in different pies

54
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:08,235
all the time, so it was fun.

55
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:13,577
And slowly from there I learned what UX is.

56
00:03:13,577 --> 00:03:16,877
And from then on, my life changed, woo.

57
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:20,258
Suddenly you learned like, it's not just boxes,

58
00:03:20,258 --> 00:03:25,080
it's not just menus, it's actually an experience, woo.

59
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,000
That's what they said, but.

60
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:29,322
So that's a little bit about me,

61
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:30,283
just in case you're wondering

62
00:03:30,283 --> 00:03:34,126
why am I talking about dark patterns.

63
00:03:34,126 --> 00:03:39,290
Before I start talking about dark patterns though,

64
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:44,635
the topic will be calling out certain techniques

65
00:03:44,635 --> 00:03:49,018
or practices that's not really the best thing for you to do.

66
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:51,620
And I really do not want to name names.

67
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,761
So things like,

68
00:03:53,802 --> 00:03:59,647
game titles or company names I'll try my best not to mention anything or anyone

69
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:03,871
because in the spirit of good sportsmanship we're supposed to lift

70
00:04:03,871 --> 00:04:08,195
each other up and support each other so calling out another company or anything

71
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:14,821
like that is a big no-no for me so because of that anything I show will not

72
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:19,685
be shown. Does that make sense? Anyway so all right let's get started.

73
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:23,837
What is a dark pattern?

74
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:25,399
Da da da da da da.

75
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,182
And I don't have music, so I have to make my own music.

76
00:04:27,182 --> 00:04:27,703
So luckily,

77
00:04:34,103 --> 00:04:41,485
In 2013, a bunch of very smart academics looked into dark patterns in the design of games

78
00:04:41,485 --> 00:04:49,147
and they finally came to a conclusion or rather a definition of what dark patterns is.

79
00:04:49,147 --> 00:04:55,569
So a dark pattern is a pattern used intentionally by a game creator to cause negative experiences

80
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:59,430
for players which are against their best interest and likely to happen without their consent.

81
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,171
That's a really long thing.

82
00:05:05,108 --> 00:05:06,649
When I found out about Dark Patterns,

83
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:08,210
it was not too long ago,

84
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,553
and it was in a website called darkpatterns.org,

85
00:05:12,553 --> 00:05:16,836
and it was conceived by this dude called Harry Bricknell.

86
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:19,577
He's a London designer,

87
00:05:19,577 --> 00:05:23,980
and he noticed a few things that is a little bit iffy,

88
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,142
especially with websites and forms

89
00:05:27,142 --> 00:05:31,145
and where you buy things, commercial websites mostly.

90
00:05:31,992 --> 00:05:35,757
So these are things like when you check out something

91
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:39,483
and then they automatically add an extra item to your bag

92
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:41,425
and you don't know that you're buying something

93
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:44,429
until the very last moment you're about to pay.

94
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:46,092
So that's a little bit.

95
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:48,770
That's not great, is it?

96
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,731
You feel a bit duped.

97
00:05:49,731 --> 00:05:56,214
Other things are like, this one that annoyed me was,

98
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:58,295
if you're on a mailing list, and by law,

99
00:05:58,295 --> 00:06:03,458
you do have an unsubscribe button link right at the bottom,

100
00:06:03,458 --> 00:06:06,439
and some companies will have the link provided,

101
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:09,381
but then they'll make the font the same,

102
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:10,922
sorry, not font, the color.

103
00:06:11,714 --> 00:06:16,757
the same as the background, so you can't see it unless you actually highlight the sentence.

104
00:06:16,757 --> 00:06:22,181
So it's things like that that is really skeezy and not really nice to be honest.

105
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:29,265
So those things are dark patterns and what I want to talk about is dark patterns in video games

106
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:35,770
specifically. So these academics when they talked about dark patterns it's mostly about game design

107
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,653
and obviously we're in the UX summit so we're going to talk about the UX of dark patterns.

108
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:45,444
Right, so with dark patterns,

109
00:06:45,444 --> 00:06:46,404
I need to go into what you call good UX.

110
00:06:46,404 --> 00:06:46,464
So,

111
00:06:46,464 --> 00:06:47,565
good UX.

112
00:06:47,565 --> 00:06:48,746
What is good UX?

113
00:06:48,746 --> 00:06:52,088
And it's a very vague term.

114
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:52,168
So,

115
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,432
I guess from a technique point of view,

116
00:07:08,432 --> 00:07:11,095
good UX could mean, oh, the technique is perfect.

117
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:13,297
You've got your psychological principles

118
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:15,859
and your behavioral techniques that you apply

119
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:20,824
to your interface to get, to reach your goals.

120
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:27,708
So let's say our intended goal is monetization and user retention, and this is actually pretty much what all games try to get.

121
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:39,553
And it's been proven recently, the global game software market revenue in December 2016 increased by 10% to a record 7.6 billion.

122
00:07:39,553 --> 00:07:44,896
That's billion with a B, so that's loads of money.

123
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:49,558
So clearly, good UX is a huge contributor

124
00:07:49,558 --> 00:07:52,500
to people spending money and staying,

125
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,380
playing the games on and on and on.

126
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,802
But I wouldn't say this is good UX.

127
00:07:56,802 --> 00:08:00,043
I would actually say it's effective UX

128
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:02,784
because good could mean ethically good.

129
00:08:02,784 --> 00:08:04,945
And sometimes some of these things

130
00:08:04,945 --> 00:08:08,407
aren't actually ethically good, but they are effective.

131
00:08:11,161 --> 00:08:13,083
So what about bad UX?

132
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:14,926
So what would you call bad UX?

133
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:15,948
I would say.

134
00:08:17,874 --> 00:08:23,577
A user experience should cover all aspects of the person's experience with the system,

135
00:08:23,577 --> 00:08:29,321
including design, graphics, interface, physical interaction, tutorials, and all that.

136
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:34,325
So if you're going through a game and it pisses you off,

137
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:36,086
that's pretty much bad UX to me.

138
00:08:36,086 --> 00:08:42,550
So if a player feels cheated or dissatisfied from an experience with a game,

139
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:49,272
that's considered bad UX and usually that results in a negative perception of the game,

140
00:08:49,272 --> 00:08:58,095
a negative perception of the developers, and from that a negative perception of the industry as a whole.

141
00:08:58,095 --> 00:09:04,217
This is actually quite prominent recently with the rise of free-to-play games, especially in the App Store and such.

142
00:09:04,217 --> 00:09:09,019
People do get pissed off and they think everyone's just a mani-grab when clearly that's not true.

143
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:25,383
In 2014, there was a study that mentioned out of 10 million players, 19% of those only played a game once, or opened a game once,

144
00:09:25,383 --> 00:09:34,711
and two-thirds stopped playing after the first 24 hours, and about half of spending happened in the first seven days.

145
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:36,673
So, I'm not saying that...

146
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:51,976
This is the entire reason, but a bad UX is a contributing reason to a retention drop.

147
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:53,856
And I think a bad UX is a result of exploitative UX.

148
00:09:53,856 --> 00:10:00,538
But the thing is, I know you're thinking, it makes money.

149
00:10:00,538 --> 00:10:00,658
So...

150
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,720
Why not?

151
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,181
Because I guess as developers,

152
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:06,222
that's what we're trying to do, right?

153
00:10:06,222 --> 00:10:10,183
We're just gonna take money.

154
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:13,125
Well, actually, it's about ethics.

155
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:17,367
I'm really glad some of you laughed

156
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,028
because that was a very inside joke.

157
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:22,509
The internet's gonna get me later.

158
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:23,009
So anyway.

159
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:31,801
Right, so the goal of UX design is, according to Oxford,

160
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:34,843
is to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty

161
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:37,585
through the utility, ease of use, and pleasure

162
00:10:37,585 --> 00:10:40,947
provided in the interaction with a product.

163
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:43,849
I do believe as a UX practitioner,

164
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:47,231
though, we do have an ethical obligation.

165
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:54,042
Doc patterns are ultimately a cynical yet working method

166
00:10:54,042 --> 00:10:56,723
for developers to make quick cash.

167
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:59,905
It's a short-term solution to a financial problem

168
00:10:59,905 --> 00:11:03,847
that yields little to no trust from your player base.

169
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:07,569
If developers wish to cultivate a loyal, long-term,

170
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:10,590
and meaningful relationship with their customers,

171
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,712
then it has to consider good and open practices.

172
00:11:13,712 --> 00:11:17,774
The user experience is front and center to that idea.

173
00:11:19,273 --> 00:11:26,238
It is my belief that through design we can demonstrate to our audience how we feel about them.

174
00:11:26,238 --> 00:11:31,202
Use of dark patterns is a monument to our lack of respect for that audience,

175
00:11:31,202 --> 00:11:36,626
and only through thoughtful design and sensible choices can we win it back.

176
00:11:36,626 --> 00:11:36,886
So, really...

177
00:11:40,642 --> 00:11:48,270
We do hold quite a lot of power in how we persuade users to use our games and how they act with our product.

178
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,355
So with that we do have a moral responsibility.

179
00:11:54,303 --> 00:12:00,604
We really should not treat players as a source of revenue.

180
00:12:00,604 --> 00:12:02,785
A person has the right to be treated

181
00:12:02,785 --> 00:12:05,085
as having intrinsic worth.

182
00:12:05,085 --> 00:12:08,346
Players aren't there for us to use as source of revenue.

183
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:10,327
They're not tools to create money.

184
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:13,007
They are individuals with their own objectives

185
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:17,548
of buying your product, like escapism or having fun.

186
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:18,088
We can pursue our own goals,

187
00:12:18,088 --> 00:12:21,849
but still respect players' desires.

188
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:30,332
And of course it takes everyone to uphold such ethics

189
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,814
because if we let others slide then it becomes normal

190
00:12:33,814 --> 00:12:34,735
and I don't think I want to be in a place

191
00:12:34,735 --> 00:12:37,216
where scheming people off of their money is a normal thing.

192
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:38,877
So enough of that.

193
00:12:38,877 --> 00:12:41,639
Should we look at actually a few dark pattern examples?

194
00:12:55,619 --> 00:12:58,741
As I mentioned before, I can't really show actual screen caps.

195
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:01,422
So these are very simplified recreation,

196
00:13:01,422 --> 00:13:03,543
as you can, I guess you can call them that.

197
00:13:03,543 --> 00:13:04,663
I made it in PowerPoint.

198
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:07,424
So please brace yourself for amazing squares.

199
00:13:07,424 --> 00:13:07,504
Ta-da.

200
00:13:07,504 --> 00:13:07,544
OK.

201
00:13:07,544 --> 00:13:10,506
So this one's called the Payton switch.

202
00:13:10,506 --> 00:13:14,187
So the Payton switch is basically

203
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:26,682
For example, there's a video ad playing automatically,

204
00:13:26,682 --> 00:13:28,362
of course, because they're annoying,

205
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:29,682
and you just want to close them.

206
00:13:29,682 --> 00:13:31,503
So you wait for the little X button to appear,

207
00:13:31,503 --> 00:13:32,903
and then you see it, and then you press it,

208
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:35,584
and then instead of the video ad closing,

209
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:38,405
it goes straight to the purchasing screen,

210
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:39,745
and you're like, are you serious?

211
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:40,605
Really, really?

212
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:41,285
I just want to, yeah.

213
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:42,946
And then this happened to me,

214
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:45,447
and I wanted to throw my phone out the window.

215
00:13:45,447 --> 00:13:47,087
I was like, why would you do this?

216
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:48,987
So that just basically made me want

217
00:13:48,987 --> 00:13:50,988
to delete the app instantly.

218
00:13:53,468 --> 00:13:56,451
I have no idea why the developers decided to do this.

219
00:13:56,451 --> 00:13:59,254
Is it because they think accidentally clicking

220
00:13:59,254 --> 00:14:04,319
onto the shop page would make me buy it or something?

221
00:14:04,319 --> 00:14:07,121
If anything, it's just annoying.

222
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:10,945
So delete the apps and don't do that, is what I say.

223
00:14:10,945 --> 00:14:15,350
Next one is a misuse of graphic design.

224
00:14:16,786 --> 00:14:19,347
This one's pretty obvious because you see this literally everywhere.

225
00:14:19,347 --> 00:14:23,809
If you go to a webpage where you're trying to download something, you find like 50 download

226
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:28,630
buttons and a teeny tiny link of the actual download link.

227
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,491
Same with apps.

228
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:30,891
Why?

229
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:31,732
Just why?

230
00:14:31,732 --> 00:14:33,152
Can you even see the cancel button?

231
00:14:33,152 --> 00:14:33,912
See why I did that?

232
00:14:33,912 --> 00:14:35,693
I made it really subtle.

233
00:14:35,693 --> 00:14:36,513
And it shouldn't be subtle.

234
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:40,960
So sometimes people rapid fire clicking through things

235
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,020
like next, next, next, next, and then the next thing you know

236
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,281
you're clicking buy and you're like, what did I do?

237
00:14:46,281 --> 00:14:48,182
So it's things like that where you're taking control

238
00:14:48,182 --> 00:14:52,583
away from the users that is considered bad practice.

239
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:55,284
Because you're basically checking them into buying

240
00:14:55,284 --> 00:14:56,505
your things rather than just letting them

241
00:14:56,505 --> 00:14:57,545
want to buy your things.

242
00:14:57,545 --> 00:14:58,385
This one's my favorite.

243
00:14:58,385 --> 00:14:59,306
Demoralizing terminology.

244
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:12,690
Yeah, as UX or UI designers, we kind of,

245
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,632
we think about the words that we use really carefully

246
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:18,833
to make sure that the players understand what trying to say.

247
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,935
But then some people just decide to get really funny

248
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:24,636
about things and they just, you know,

249
00:15:24,636 --> 00:15:26,437
okay, this one I made it up, give up loser.

250
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:29,558
But I'm pretty sure there's other games who,

251
00:15:29,558 --> 00:15:32,340
that kind of demoralizes the player, kind of.

252
00:15:33,027 --> 00:15:38,390
belittles them for whatever reason and you're playing a game and the game's being snarky at you

253
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:43,192
while the UI is being snarky at you, not even the game, that's even worse.

254
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:47,214
You're being, yeah, some kind of, some menu is pissing you off.

255
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:55,698
So these kind of things contribute to an overall bad experience, so therefore, ooh, bad UX.

256
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:02,064
Next one is called daily quote unquote rewards.

257
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:05,946
So this is where just as you're about to leave an app,

258
00:16:05,946 --> 00:16:07,386
they will say, oh, you should log in tomorrow.

259
00:16:07,386 --> 00:16:11,148
And you might get this thing.

260
00:16:11,148 --> 00:16:13,909
It's like a 0.000003% chance of getting it.

261
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:14,670
So you should totally try.

262
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,011
And then you log in every day hoping

263
00:16:17,011 --> 00:16:18,451
to get that one amazing item.

264
00:16:18,451 --> 00:16:19,252
And you just don't.

265
00:16:19,252 --> 00:16:23,634
That's basically dangling a carrot in front of your players

266
00:16:23,634 --> 00:16:25,394
and making them come back for more.

267
00:16:26,335 --> 00:16:28,676
the chances are really low.

268
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:32,639
I mean, daily login bonuses is not a bad thing,

269
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,980
but when you promise something

270
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,601
with such a low chance of reward,

271
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:40,044
it's almost like you're giving them false hope.

272
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:40,865
I sound like a scorned lover, I'm sorry.

273
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:41,185
Right, next one.

274
00:16:41,185 --> 00:16:43,486
Oof, guilt-tripping notifications.

275
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:43,867
This one.

276
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,244
I really, really hate these.

277
00:16:55,244 --> 00:16:58,886
This is why every time I download a new app or a new game,

278
00:16:58,886 --> 00:17:02,147
I instantly deny any notifications

279
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:05,628
because you get stuff like this where like,

280
00:17:05,628 --> 00:17:08,009
oh, you know, that's the voice I'm imagining

281
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:09,350
the notification to sound like,

282
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,731
you're dying, when can you come back?

283
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,452
I was like, oh my God, shut up.

284
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:16,293
Yeah, I'm literally saying shut up to my own notifications.

285
00:17:17,628 --> 00:17:21,529
I know that they're supposed to remind you that the game is still going on and they're

286
00:17:21,529 --> 00:17:26,270
supposed to entice you to come back, but if they're being whiny and they're basically

287
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:33,492
making you feel bad for leaving them, that's almost as bad as those, again, email subscriptions

288
00:17:33,492 --> 00:17:37,333
that you unsubscribe from and then you go to the website and then there's like a sad

289
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,574
little owl that's like, oh, I'm going to die now because you unsubscribed.

290
00:17:40,574 --> 00:17:41,454
It's like, really?

291
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,842
Yeah, so it's things like that.

292
00:17:46,842 --> 00:17:48,984
Like, it's completely unnecessary to add grievances.

293
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:54,287
So next one is social validation and compliance.

294
00:17:54,287 --> 00:17:56,309
This one is basically using your own friends

295
00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:02,993
to peer pressure you into playing your game.

296
00:18:02,993 --> 00:18:09,077
So the element of having friends playing the same games

297
00:18:09,077 --> 00:18:10,037
does actually,

298
00:18:11,797 --> 00:18:13,698
make you come back to a game more often.

299
00:18:13,698 --> 00:18:14,458
There's a study for this,

300
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,699
I can't really cite it right now because I forgot.

301
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:19,400
But the one thing that shouldn't happen

302
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,822
is when you're pushing it so much

303
00:18:22,822 --> 00:18:27,465
when that person, your friend, probably doesn't even care.

304
00:18:27,465 --> 00:18:29,686
Like, they're kind of using,

305
00:18:29,686 --> 00:18:33,608
they're using people you know to coax you

306
00:18:33,608 --> 00:18:38,570
into getting, into going back into the game.

307
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,992
And I think I just personally don't really like that.

308
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:45,490
Right.

309
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,232
So there are some ways of doing things.

310
00:18:48,232 --> 00:18:52,956
Like monetization isn't evil.

311
00:18:52,956 --> 00:18:56,098
In-app purchases is not evil, obviously,

312
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:59,040
but there are ways to do it better

313
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,743
and not so annoying, I guess.

314
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:07,521
So this one's a good one, which is called clear trade-offs.

315
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,983
So these are two different examples.

316
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,766
But basically, you are giving choice to the player.

317
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:17,448
They know exactly what's happening, and they have a choice,

318
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:21,631
and you are giving them control over what they want to do.

319
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:24,573
Do you want them, if your game is good enough,

320
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:27,335
and they're enjoying it, they probably wouldn't mind

321
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:31,258
watching that 30-second ad without you pushing it to them.

322
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:32,899
I mean, I'm pretty sure, I've done it myself.

323
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:35,609
I know a lot of other people have.

324
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:37,570
And the fact that they've actually let me say,

325
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:41,173
nope, I really don't want to watch this right now.

326
00:19:41,173 --> 00:19:42,694
I just want to continue playing something else.

327
00:19:42,694 --> 00:19:48,879
The same with a paywall where you buy once and that's it.

328
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:50,100
No more ads forever.

329
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,842
So that's also one of my favorites because you know what?

330
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:54,983
If your game is so good, I don't want ads,

331
00:19:54,983 --> 00:19:56,304
I will give you the money.

332
00:19:56,304 --> 00:19:57,685
Just don't bombard me with things.

333
00:19:57,685 --> 00:20:01,148
Again, this is about giving the player control.

334
00:20:03,793 --> 00:20:06,216
Next one is balance UI design.

335
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:10,241
So, as you know, most in-app purchases menus

336
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:12,264
do have multiple choices,

337
00:20:12,264 --> 00:20:14,667
where from the lowest to the highest.

338
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:17,771
What gets me, what really ruffles my

339
00:20:18,497 --> 00:20:23,898
feathers is when they automatically highlight the most expensive choice and make them animate or

340
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:31,220
something and it's like $99 or something insane like that and children have been known to buy

341
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:39,882
these things because they have zero concept of in-app gem real world values. I'm not using the

342
00:20:39,882 --> 00:20:44,943
right terms but I think you know what I'm saying. The good thing about that is that that phenomenon

343
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,503
has been curbed with actual laws like you know what

344
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:51,605
Amazon or Apple, those platforms have been sued

345
00:20:51,605 --> 00:20:54,205
because they made it too easy for children

346
00:20:54,205 --> 00:20:58,926
to buy these things without any parental supervision.

347
00:20:58,926 --> 00:20:59,466
So, from a UX perspective,

348
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:03,227
we could have curbed that a little bit.

349
00:21:03,227 --> 00:21:08,769
I mean, just to make sure everything's balanced

350
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:13,910
and to not prey on accidental purchases, basically.

351
00:21:16,227 --> 00:21:19,351
And the next one is definitive and clear language.

352
00:21:19,351 --> 00:21:19,411
So.

353
00:21:22,544 --> 00:21:26,567
Again, this one, players tend to have a mental model

354
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:32,231
of what they expect the UI to say or what the game does.

355
00:21:32,231 --> 00:21:36,274
And if your game or menu basically is very clear

356
00:21:36,274 --> 00:21:39,636
and very distinct about what's happening,

357
00:21:39,636 --> 00:21:41,097
they are less likely to be confused,

358
00:21:41,097 --> 00:21:42,999
they are less likely to be frustrated,

359
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:46,721
and therefore they are less likely to have a bad experience.

360
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:48,843
So as long as everything's clear,

361
00:21:48,843 --> 00:21:51,805
because I'm pretty sure there has been games

362
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:57,886
they muddle up words, they use words that might sound like yes, might sound like no,

363
00:21:57,886 --> 00:22:02,047
but not quite, and just like, why is that? And you don't understand, and you kind of just click

364
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:06,188
it anyway, and you end up somewhere you don't want to be. So therefore you get frustrated.

365
00:22:06,188 --> 00:22:12,569
So things like that is easily rectified with just clear language.

366
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:13,589
This one is rewarding loyalty.

367
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:28,170
I play a certain free-to-play game that goes up to the thousands of levels and I think I'm one of

368
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:34,435
those losers that continue. I've played this game for four years straight basically and at one point

369
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:41,740
I was so addicted to this game that I installed the game to my sister's phone or my brother's

370
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:47,224
iPad you know so I have like three devices on the go. What I did notice was that on my account

371
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:49,186
because I've gone up to like level a thousand.

372
00:22:50,546 --> 00:22:53,868
I barely saw any ads or any intrusive anything.

373
00:22:53,868 --> 00:22:57,131
It was really easy to play and I was just continuously playing it.

374
00:22:57,131 --> 00:23:00,853
But when I played on my sister's phone or something,

375
00:23:00,853 --> 00:23:03,375
there would be ads popping up a bit more, you know.

376
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:08,559
And to be honest, these kind of ads are a bit of a necessary evil,

377
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,220
I guess, with free-to-play games.

378
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:13,182
But the fact that they never show up on my account

379
00:23:13,182 --> 00:23:16,265
because I'm level 1000-something is kind of nice.

380
00:23:16,265 --> 00:23:18,586
They're kind of rewarding me for being a loyal customer.

381
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:24,508
and I've had such a good time with them that I have spent money and I don't feel at all bad.

382
00:23:24,508 --> 00:23:28,231
I wish I could name this game because it actually has good UX.

383
00:23:28,231 --> 00:23:31,033
It's one of the few free-to-play games that does it well.

384
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:32,014
Right, so what does this mean for us?

385
00:23:32,014 --> 00:23:32,634
So if you're a UI or UX designer,

386
00:23:42,226 --> 00:23:47,707
you should discuss the matter of ethics,

387
00:23:47,707 --> 00:23:49,668
or rather the lack of a code of ethics,

388
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:53,009
because the lack of code of ethics

389
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:54,989
is kind of the reason why people get away

390
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:56,269
with all these things.

391
00:23:56,269 --> 00:24:01,371
A lot of the reason why these practices are so common

392
00:24:01,371 --> 00:24:02,451
is because the company,

393
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:03,491
they set their values more on

394
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,852
getting monetization or getting,

395
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:19,337
squeezing out the final penny from quote-unquote whale users.

396
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:22,000
I really don't like that term, but it's true.

397
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,605
And sometimes you kind of have to stand your ground.

398
00:24:26,605 --> 00:24:27,806
I know it's difficult.

399
00:24:27,806 --> 00:24:29,889
Like I think I've been there where I feel like

400
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:31,170
I don't really want to do this,

401
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,491
but you kind of have to follow orders.

402
00:24:32,491 --> 00:24:33,713
But sometimes if you...

403
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:42,054
if you stay in your case strong enough and kind of stand together, maybe I'm being a bit romantic

404
00:24:42,054 --> 00:24:49,943
about this, I don't know, the power of friendship, yay! Hopefully it will become less commonplace.

405
00:24:51,628 --> 00:25:02,371
So you have to ask yourself as a UX designer though, what you design, does it manipulate players or does it aid them and let them feel secure about their knowledge and decisions?

406
00:25:02,371 --> 00:25:14,393
People don't like feeling out of control and as UX designers we do persuade players to do certain things, but persuading shouldn't be manipulating.

407
00:25:16,071 --> 00:25:23,179
And of course there's always ways to design for the mutual benefit of players and the game.

408
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:29,687
Video games is still a business, but that doesn't mean you should

409
00:25:29,687 --> 00:25:35,013
exploit people for the sake of monetary gain.

410
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:44,394
And if you're a company, it would be great if you could ensure the UX conveys company values.

411
00:25:44,394 --> 00:25:50,856
If you remember what I said earlier, you have a bad experience, you think badly of the game,

412
00:25:50,856 --> 00:25:56,039
and you start thinking badly of that company, and soon people are just like,

413
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:59,280
God, video games, all they do is waste your money and waste your time.

414
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,782
When in fact that's not true. I'm pretty sure everybody in this room knows that's not true.

415
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:08,967
So, it'd be great if companies could facilitate

416
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,810
an environment that allows for the refusal

417
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,072
of unethical requests.

418
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,153
Sometimes things happen, and sometimes people are like,

419
00:26:16,153 --> 00:26:18,315
wait, this gets money, because that's metrics.

420
00:26:18,315 --> 00:26:20,918
You know, metrics shows that it works.

421
00:26:20,918 --> 00:26:24,541
Sure, it does work, but at what cost?

422
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:27,464
It feels a little bit like selling your soul to the devil.

423
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:31,384
different companies have different priorities,

424
00:26:31,384 --> 00:26:34,389
and there has been people who has left certain companies

425
00:26:34,389 --> 00:26:36,752
because they don't agree with their company policies.

426
00:26:36,752 --> 00:26:38,375
I'm not saying you should quit your jobs or anything,

427
00:26:38,375 --> 00:26:40,959
but you are who you work with.

428
00:26:42,586 --> 00:26:46,348
And finally, use metrics to increase player enjoyment

429
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:49,150
and not as a tool of manipulation.

430
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,510
I'm pretty sure you can see by now

431
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:53,912
that I use the word manipulation quite a lot in this.

432
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,674
It's a really fine line between aiding a player

433
00:26:56,674 --> 00:26:58,715
to do what you want or persuading them

434
00:26:58,715 --> 00:27:03,938
or just guiding them and literally manipulating them

435
00:27:03,938 --> 00:27:06,860
to do things that they don't want to do.

436
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,061
So as UX designers, we do have quite a lot of power

437
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:10,542
and with that much power,

438
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:12,203
we have quite a bit of responsibility.

439
00:27:14,314 --> 00:27:15,955
So finally, I just want to end my talk with a quote that,

440
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:16,776
can you guys guess who this is from?

441
00:27:16,776 --> 00:27:17,176
Anybody?

442
00:27:17,176 --> 00:27:17,777
Go on.

443
00:27:17,777 --> 00:27:19,358
Satoru Iwata.

444
00:27:19,358 --> 00:27:20,279
Yeah, Satoru Iwata.

445
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:21,520
Business card, I'm a corporate president.

446
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,921
In my mind, I am a game developer,

447
00:27:22,921 --> 00:27:23,722
but in my heart, I am a gamer.

448
00:27:37,393 --> 00:27:39,334
That rings true for most of us, I think.

449
00:27:39,334 --> 00:27:41,555
No matter what we are on our business cards,

450
00:27:41,555 --> 00:27:44,357
we are still gamers, so therefore we know what it's like

451
00:27:44,357 --> 00:27:45,658
to be on the other side.

452
00:27:45,658 --> 00:27:50,061
Why would we want to manipulate them when we are them?

453
00:27:50,061 --> 00:27:51,222
And this one is, can anybody guess this one?

454
00:27:51,222 --> 00:27:54,624
It's actually me, I wanna do this first.

455
00:27:54,624 --> 00:27:54,824
Yay!

456
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:08,030
Probably you guys too, I mean that's my point. We're all gamers at heart and we're all game developers

457
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,731
We do this because we love it

458
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:14,073
And I'm pretty sure all of you remember your first games and you grew up thinking oh man

459
00:28:14,073 --> 00:28:19,034
I want to make that I want to make games that people enjoy and could remember by and

460
00:28:21,495 --> 00:28:24,335
I just want you to remember that when you go to work,

461
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:25,416
when you make games,

462
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:29,737
remember why you got into the industry in the first place.

463
00:28:29,737 --> 00:28:32,137
It's not to manipulate people, it's not to get,

464
00:28:32,137 --> 00:28:34,257
it's not a cash grab, it's literally an art.

465
00:28:34,257 --> 00:28:37,998
And you have to remember why he got there in the first place.

466
00:28:37,998 --> 00:28:39,519
So thank you very much, and I hope you UX responsibly.
