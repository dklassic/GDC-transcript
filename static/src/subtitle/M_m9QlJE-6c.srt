1
00:00:05,223 --> 00:00:05,803
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06,684 --> 00:00:07,025
Allow me.

3
00:00:07,746 --> 00:00:07,786
Hi.

4
00:00:08,907 --> 00:00:08,947
Hi.

5
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:10,849
This is where you can tell I'm a teacher.

6
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:14,554
I keep expecting sort of callback response.

7
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:18,859
So I've been in the ed tech industry for over 10 years

8
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:21,902
and I got into ed tech because of game development

9
00:00:22,162 --> 00:00:24,225
and because of working in 3D animation.

10
00:00:24,245 --> 00:00:25,947
So this is really exciting for me.

11
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:30,127
So throughout the years, I've been responsible for bringing

12
00:00:30,147 --> 00:00:32,690
a variety of different game engines to the classroom.

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,412
I'm usually the girl you call when there's no documentation.

14
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:38,594
So I don't get to do fun things like Unreal or Unity.

15
00:00:38,614 --> 00:00:41,377
I like going where no one really has gone before.

16
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:44,419
And in those 10 years that I've been in ed tech,

17
00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:48,122
I've also had the great pleasure of leading education teams

18
00:00:48,162 --> 00:00:50,384
that are responsible for subject matters.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,243
like cryptography, machine vision, everything down to scratch,

20
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:58,467
and practically every single programming language under the sun.

21
00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:00,809
I've probably had to produce a course on it.

22
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,934
But I'm here today as part of Roblox Education.

23
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:12,499
Over this past year, I've had the great pleasure of getting to officially launch Roblox Education.

24
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,421
We have a website now. You should check it out.

25
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:19,869
Today's talk is on the Roblox Creator Challenge.

26
00:01:20,529 --> 00:01:25,092
So the Roblox Creator Challenge is a self-paced tutorial

27
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:28,593
that's designed to attract new people to game development

28
00:01:28,613 --> 00:01:32,075
and coding, assuming they've had absolutely no experience with it

29
00:01:32,115 --> 00:01:32,595
before.

30
00:01:35,417 --> 00:01:38,578
So the topics I'm going to go over today, first of all,

31
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,219
what is the Creator Challenge?

32
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:42,120
So you have some idea of what I'm talking about.

33
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,821
Why do we do this?

34
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:46,341
Why is this important to us?

35
00:01:46,782 --> 00:01:48,242
Why is this important to our industry?

36
00:01:50,523 --> 00:01:52,524
What are some of the challenges and strategies

37
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:56,246
for working with a group that is new to these subjects?

38
00:01:58,127 --> 00:01:59,727
And then finally, what did we learn

39
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:01,648
from our first Roblox Creator Challenge,

40
00:02:02,068 --> 00:02:04,069
and how are we using that as we move forward

41
00:02:04,169 --> 00:02:05,330
in our newer iterations?

42
00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:12,053
Okay, so the Roblox Creator Challenge, as I mentioned,

43
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:17,031
is a self-paced template-based tutorial designed specifically

44
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:20,052
for people with no experience of game designer coding.

45
00:02:21,652 --> 00:02:23,512
Each creator challenge has three parts.

46
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:27,053
We have a template that has some pre-built assets to it.

47
00:02:27,253 --> 00:02:29,154
This works within Roblox Studio, which

48
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:31,214
is the development tool that's used to create

49
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:32,555
all of Roblox's games.

50
00:02:34,915 --> 00:02:37,216
We have the step-by-step tutorial section,

51
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:39,517
so you can actually figure out how to do the things.

52
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,411
And then finally, we have a quiz game.

53
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:45,556
This is our checks for understanding.

54
00:02:45,576 --> 00:02:48,883
It's also how we deliver prizes such as badges

55
00:02:49,023 --> 00:02:50,306
and free avatar items.

56
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:57,714
Our first creator challenge was in partnership with Jurassic World.

57
00:02:57,834 --> 00:02:59,656
It attracted over 6 million people.

58
00:02:59,676 --> 00:03:03,859
And in three months, we had over 270,000 games published.

59
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,921
So I'm going to show you a video.

60
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:07,622
It was made actually during last summer.

61
00:03:07,642 --> 00:03:09,624
So some of the numbers on it are older.

62
00:03:10,084 --> 00:03:12,126
But you get to see the template that we use.

63
00:03:12,206 --> 00:03:14,808
And you also get to see a lot of the student embellishments to it.

64
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:18,695
So in addition to dinosaurs and falling rocks,

65
00:03:18,736 --> 00:03:20,960
you're probably going to see maybe some falling eyeballs

66
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,264
if you're paying close attention, beach balls,

67
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:25,689
some really colorful climbing walls.

68
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:27,853
So you can tell there's some student work in here.

69
00:04:28,428 --> 00:04:30,330
So that's the Roblox Creator Challenge.

70
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:32,572
I'm very proud of it.

71
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:34,713
Roblox it.

72
00:04:35,514 --> 00:04:35,634
Yay.

73
00:04:35,654 --> 00:04:35,954
Thank you.

74
00:04:35,974 --> 00:04:36,735
I appreciate that.

75
00:04:38,316 --> 00:04:40,678
So that's what the Creator Challenge is.

76
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:42,439
So now, why do we do this?

77
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,821
Roblox isn't an education company.

78
00:04:44,941 --> 00:04:46,182
We do all of this for free.

79
00:04:46,722 --> 00:04:49,744
So particularly, teachers like to ask me what's in it for us.

80
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:53,067
And why we do it is really born of the question,

81
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:54,508
how can I do it?

82
00:04:54,954 --> 00:04:58,296
UGC platform actively drive diversity in our player base?

83
00:04:59,197 --> 00:05:01,379
To me, I think the answer is fairly obvious

84
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:04,581
by driving a more diverse developer community.

85
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,802
And that's how Roblox felt.

86
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:07,243
So that's why they hired me.

87
00:05:07,743 --> 00:05:10,486
We started creating content, giving it away to teachers.

88
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:13,248
So we released lesson plans, tutorials.

89
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:15,690
We worked with some really fantastic

90
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,451
education leaders in the industry.

91
00:05:18,572 --> 00:05:19,873
But it wasn't quite enough.

92
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:23,175
We were finding that these programs

93
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:24,036
that we were working with.

94
00:05:24,561 --> 00:05:26,562
It was more affluent students who were attending.

95
00:05:26,582 --> 00:05:29,023
And it also was people who already knew

96
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:31,023
they wanted to make video games, which is great.

97
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,604
We want them to make video games.

98
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:37,246
But we also want the people who it hadn't ever occurred

99
00:05:37,266 --> 00:05:39,466
to them to make a video game to come and try to make games.

100
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:41,487
We also want perhaps the people

101
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:43,128
who didn't have the opportunity,

102
00:05:43,168 --> 00:05:44,468
who couldn't afford to go to these

103
00:05:45,069 --> 00:05:47,209
like really awesome tech camps in the summer.

104
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,251
So we decided we were gonna make our own tutorial

105
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:52,911
and release it completely free.

106
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,922
All right, so how many educators do I have in the room?

107
00:05:59,763 --> 00:06:00,263
Okay, a few.

108
00:06:00,283 --> 00:06:02,044
How many of you guys are game developers?

109
00:06:03,365 --> 00:06:05,727
Awesome, wow, thank you very much for coming.

110
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,829
So of you guys who are educators, let's see,

111
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:11,290
any of you guys teach college level?

112
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:13,531
No, middle school?

113
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:15,893
All right, high school?

114
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:17,854
Okay.

115
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:20,295
Anyone teaching like elementary school?

116
00:06:21,697 --> 00:06:22,337
Elementary school?

117
00:06:22,878 --> 00:06:25,720
Okay, so a lot of the things I'm talking today

118
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:29,442
aren't really age-specific strategies.

119
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,064
There are a lot of challenges

120
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:32,545
with working with certain age groups,

121
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:34,827
but the subjects I'm going over today

122
00:06:34,907 --> 00:06:36,848
are much more about how do you attract people

123
00:06:36,888 --> 00:06:38,750
to come and be game developers in the first place?

124
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,811
Assuming that they've got no experience,

125
00:06:40,871 --> 00:06:41,632
how do you keep them?

126
00:06:44,474 --> 00:06:47,136
All right, so that's what I would say.

127
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:53,327
So the first challenge you have is getting them to try out your content in the first place

128
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:56,468
and getting them to not leave is the next challenge.

129
00:06:57,568 --> 00:07:02,569
A good place to getting them to come in and try it is by leveraging their interests

130
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,430
and of course giving them rewards.

131
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,311
In our case, we're leveraging the fact that we have a really popular platform.

132
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:13,153
If you work with a younger age group or if you know any kids that are 10 and up,

133
00:07:13,894 --> 00:07:14,634
They tend to love us.

134
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:16,755
The other thing that we have in our favor

135
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:20,556
is we're working with the Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom.

136
00:07:21,096 --> 00:07:24,297
It's really hard to go wrong with dinosaurs

137
00:07:24,397 --> 00:07:25,578
and lava and volcanoes.

138
00:07:26,618 --> 00:07:29,399
However, if you're not working with those sets of IPs,

139
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:30,959
there are options.

140
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,620
If you're working with younger students,

141
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,921
you can bring in evergreen themes,

142
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:38,742
anything like narwhals, cats, dogs, ninjas,

143
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:40,843
stuff that isn't necessarily IP related

144
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:43,323
will make your content instantly more relatable.

145
00:07:44,994 --> 00:07:46,895
And if you're working with older students,

146
00:07:47,016 --> 00:07:49,178
you can still look at what they're interested in.

147
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:51,760
They have hobbies, they love pop culture.

148
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,142
You can show how you can connect game development

149
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,824
to any subject matter they love.

150
00:07:55,964 --> 00:07:57,145
It doesn't matter if it's sports.

151
00:07:57,726 --> 00:08:00,408
And you can also show them how game development

152
00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:02,991
can be a vehicle for taking the social issues

153
00:08:03,011 --> 00:08:03,872
that are important to them

154
00:08:03,892 --> 00:08:05,853
and creating a narrative around it.

155
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:14,997
And speaking of narrative, when you're working with these themes, you don't just want to

156
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:19,119
throw those interests into images and to reward items.

157
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,480
You also want to make sure that you're creating a narrative around them in your content.

158
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:29,771
One of my favorite books ever is Made to Stick by Chip and Dan Heath.

159
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:34,832
It talks about how as human beings we really just crave stories.

160
00:08:35,593 --> 00:08:40,675
So in our tutorial we relied heavily on the narrative of having to get blue.

161
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,377
the velociraptor off of the island before the volcano erupted.

162
00:08:45,118 --> 00:08:48,760
And this is particularly important because I'm working with a game engine.

163
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:53,624
This isn't a pre-built game where I can put them on rails and I can keep them

164
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:56,406
from doing things. This is a template where they can go and

165
00:08:56,426 --> 00:09:00,289
do anything they want. If a student wants to, they could just

166
00:09:00,349 --> 00:09:01,950
create a block at the top of the volcano,

167
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,392
make it go all the way down past the lava, and then race to the finish.

168
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:09,194
But we found as soon as we put in blue the velociraptor

169
00:09:09,214 --> 00:09:11,855
and we created the story that you had to get to her

170
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,456
and then you had to build bridges

171
00:09:13,996 --> 00:09:16,317
and then you had to code the next item to get her across,

172
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:19,598
we found that our testers, including our adult testers,

173
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:22,119
they stopped cheating their way down nearly so often.

174
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:25,400
And they really, really became willing

175
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,821
to place themselves in that narrative and follow along.

176
00:09:31,803 --> 00:09:31,943
So.

177
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:37,994
A nice byproduct of having blue as a part of our narrative

178
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:42,480
was that we got to use her as a really student-friendly surrogate

179
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:43,482
for the end user.

180
00:09:44,534 --> 00:09:47,875
We wanted students to not only think about making games,

181
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,836
but to think about the person on the other side of the games.

182
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:53,337
Because I believe that's probably

183
00:09:53,497 --> 00:09:56,038
one of the most important skills anybody can have.

184
00:09:56,558 --> 00:09:58,379
It doesn't even matter if you're going into game development,

185
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,800
if you're going to be in film, if you're

186
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,720
going to be an engineer, trying to think

187
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,081
about how somebody else is going to experience your product,

188
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:05,942
that's something that's going to serve you well

189
00:10:05,982 --> 00:10:07,082
no matter what career you choose.

190
00:10:08,223 --> 00:10:11,644
But trying to actually think of this imaginary user

191
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:13,985
and what they want to do, adults struggle with that.

192
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,600
So by putting in blue, we could say like,

193
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,681
hey, not only do you have to be able to play your game,

194
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:22,883
but blue has to actually get off the island with you.

195
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:25,504
So that's what they had to do

196
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:26,744
whenever they played the HIST of the game,

197
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:28,525
and it worked really, really well.

198
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:32,566
If you don't have something like blue,

199
00:10:32,626 --> 00:10:34,927
usually what I suggest is that you just have them

200
00:10:34,987 --> 00:10:36,208
do play tests with each other.

201
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:38,028
So you have to be like, all right,

202
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:40,629
two other people have to be able to beat your level,

203
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:41,550
that sort of thing.

204
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:47,842
Another problem you have a lot of times

205
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:49,103
when you're working with content,

206
00:10:49,143 --> 00:10:52,084
particularly game engines and coding,

207
00:10:52,224 --> 00:10:54,504
is they tend to be extremely technical.

208
00:10:55,005 --> 00:10:57,525
Meaning, the more leeway you put in

209
00:10:57,585 --> 00:10:59,026
for them to express themselves,

210
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:01,107
a lot of times also the more opportunity

211
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:03,107
for troubleshooting you're putting in as well.

212
00:11:03,868 --> 00:11:05,868
But if you don't allow them to explore,

213
00:11:05,888 --> 00:11:08,589
they're not really gonna understand the concepts

214
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:09,450
you're trying to give them.

215
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,550
And they're not really gonna feel a lot of agency over it.

216
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,891
And that's actually one thing you have to be aware of

217
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:16,091
if you're working with a template.

218
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:18,732
The pro is that you're gonna have something

219
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:19,652
that looks beautiful,

220
00:11:19,672 --> 00:11:21,732
it's gonna look a little less like student art,

221
00:11:22,292 --> 00:11:23,592
but the con is they're not gonna feel

222
00:11:23,613 --> 00:11:24,673
as much ownership of it.

223
00:11:25,513 --> 00:11:28,633
So wherever you can, try to give them that ownership.

224
00:11:28,793 --> 00:11:30,294
If there's a color that doesn't matter,

225
00:11:30,754 --> 00:11:31,894
let them pick that color.

226
00:11:32,414 --> 00:11:34,095
Let them choose the names of their variables,

227
00:11:34,815 --> 00:11:37,015
and if you've got fireballs raining from the sky,

228
00:11:37,555 --> 00:11:38,995
show them how to use other objects

229
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,036
to rain from the sky instead of your fireball.

230
00:11:41,676 --> 00:11:44,877
And that resulted in beach balls and eyeballs and flower pots

231
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,278
falling out of the sky, which honestly doesn't

232
00:11:47,518 --> 00:11:50,539
fit our theme of dinosaurs and volcanoes and lava.

233
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:53,720
But students, when they get to do that kind of thing,

234
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,621
they have a much better understanding

235
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:58,162
of what tables and arrays actually do

236
00:11:58,862 --> 00:12:01,083
and how you can actually put other objects inside of them.

237
00:12:01,103 --> 00:12:03,804
And they're also just much more proud of something

238
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,564
that feels like it's their own.

239
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:09,686
All right.

240
00:12:11,353 --> 00:12:13,013
So you've got them in your content.

241
00:12:13,653 --> 00:12:14,694
So far they're enjoying it.

242
00:12:15,214 --> 00:12:16,774
They're expressing themselves a little bit.

243
00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:21,055
So how do you manage burnout versus boredom?

244
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:24,836
It's really, really similar to the same things

245
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:26,597
you have to worry about in video game design

246
00:12:26,797 --> 00:12:27,497
and even in film.

247
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:31,618
So if things are too easy, they get bored.

248
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:33,218
If nothing's happening, people get bored.

249
00:12:33,238 --> 00:12:34,558
If there's no challenge, people get bored.

250
00:12:36,018 --> 00:12:37,739
If you keep ramping up the difficulty

251
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:39,080
and you just constantly have them

252
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,562
learning mechanic after mechanic after mechanic

253
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:43,503
or concept after concept after concept,

254
00:12:44,184 --> 00:12:44,985
they're gonna burn out.

255
00:12:45,205 --> 00:12:47,527
Our brains don't like working at top speed,

256
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:50,289
at top capacity for very, very long.

257
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,412
So ideally, you have a nice progression curve.

258
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,734
And my background being a hybrid

259
00:12:57,774 --> 00:12:59,295
between game development and education,

260
00:12:59,716 --> 00:13:02,218
the fact that I see this curve show up in both places

261
00:13:02,838 --> 00:13:04,379
I think is one of the most fascinating things

262
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:05,660
about living between both worlds.

263
00:13:06,794 --> 00:13:10,637
So how I take advantage of creating a decent progression

264
00:13:10,677 --> 00:13:13,419
curve is I think about the topics that I have,

265
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,583
sort of place them like what's more pleasing, what tends to be easier,

266
00:13:17,603 --> 00:13:19,004
and I intersperse them.

267
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:22,246
When you're working with game engines, a lot of game engines

268
00:13:22,266 --> 00:13:24,929
will have built-in tiles or built-in terrain.

269
00:13:25,903 --> 00:13:28,204
Honestly, that tends to be more intuitive in most engines.

270
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,405
People tend to like it, feel pretty good about it.

271
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:33,525
So rather than putting that just at the beginning,

272
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:35,286
I usually will put it somewhere in the middle

273
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:37,306
since it's really satisfying, and use it

274
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:40,107
as one of the dips in between the coding sections.

275
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:43,528
So I kind of went coding, building, coding, building,

276
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:44,168
coding, building.

277
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:46,449
Or the other way around, building, coding,

278
00:13:46,469 --> 00:13:46,989
building, coding.

279
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:49,670
That way, they had some lulls in between.

280
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,450
Their brains got to take a break.

281
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:56,411
And they got to sit in the topics a little bit longer.

282
00:13:56,431 --> 00:14:01,453
All right.

283
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:03,353
So now I have them.

284
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:06,774
And I want them to go try my more advanced content.

285
00:14:07,374 --> 00:14:11,155
So as I was saying earlier, these creator challenges,

286
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:12,616
they're designed for people who are new.

287
00:14:12,676 --> 00:14:14,756
They're kind of like, I don't know, maybe I'd like coding.

288
00:14:14,796 --> 00:14:16,117
Maybe I'd like game development.

289
00:14:17,463 --> 00:14:19,644
But we hopefully are thinking that maybe they'll

290
00:14:19,664 --> 00:14:22,665
go take a class or they'll go and take a look

291
00:14:22,705 --> 00:14:24,126
at our more in-depth content.

292
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,247
So the Creator Challenge is like a taster

293
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,528
and then we have curriculum that will actually

294
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:30,469
take you all the way from Hello World

295
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:33,030
to this is how you do everything step by step by step.

296
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:36,312
So how do I live in wanting more?

297
00:14:36,472 --> 00:14:38,553
And that's where, for me, that's where I think

298
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:40,354
about using peak end theory.

299
00:14:40,374 --> 00:14:42,455
Does anyone know what peak end theory is?

300
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,796
I have a bad prize for you if you do.

301
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,001
Or take a guess?

302
00:14:49,582 --> 00:14:49,962
All right.

303
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:51,623
Peak-end theory.

304
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:55,266
So peak-end theory is not really a concept that

305
00:14:55,506 --> 00:14:56,867
shows up in education a lot.

306
00:14:57,527 --> 00:15:00,169
And what it comes down to is leave them wanting more

307
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:01,210
and end up a bang.

308
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:05,761
So Stanford a long time ago, and I think some other institutes,

309
00:15:06,301 --> 00:15:08,302
they did these experiments that showed

310
00:15:08,823 --> 00:15:12,025
that how you evaluate an experience, if someone says,

311
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:12,825
was that movie good?

312
00:15:13,286 --> 00:15:15,187
Was that doctor experience good or bad?

313
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,188
You don't just average it out.

314
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:19,350
You don't weigh it all out.

315
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,751
What you do is you remember the extreme.

316
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:24,640
whether you loved it or hated it the most,

317
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:27,322
and then you remember how you felt at the end,

318
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:29,583
and you average out that extreme

319
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,183
with how you felt at the end.

320
00:15:31,544 --> 00:15:32,644
That's peak end theory.

321
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:36,886
So you can use that to your advantage

322
00:15:36,946 --> 00:15:38,627
if you know that's how human brains work,

323
00:15:39,227 --> 00:15:40,908
particularly if you're working with something shorter,

324
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:43,229
or if you want people to just have good memories

325
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:44,930
of your film or game or whatever it is.

326
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:49,653
In my case, I'm pretty much,

327
00:15:50,568 --> 00:15:52,049
Any game engine I've ever worked with,

328
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:53,229
not just with Roblox,

329
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:55,229
once again, terrain's always a big hit.

330
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,750
Making things explode is a big hit.

331
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,670
If you're working with Minecraft,

332
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,291
you put in all the dynamite.

333
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:04,331
If you have something that's just satisfying and blows up,

334
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,872
that works for every age range.

335
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,972
I'm talking everyone down from my six-year-olds

336
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:11,232
up to the advanced academies.

337
00:16:13,093 --> 00:16:15,533
So, I put in

338
00:16:16,817 --> 00:16:19,678
The terrain section more in the middle has a reward.

339
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:22,059
After I did some coding, so they got to sort of

340
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,661
take a step back, and at the end,

341
00:16:24,701 --> 00:16:27,042
that's when I really let them rain fireballs from the sky,

342
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:28,523
and it was really satisfying to watch.

343
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,364
So when they play the game and they see all these things

344
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:33,526
and objects that they chose falling out of the sky

345
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:35,126
and blowing things up and hurting people,

346
00:16:35,767 --> 00:16:36,987
or causing damage, I should say,

347
00:16:37,007 --> 00:16:39,809
that went really, really well.

348
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:43,211
Okay.

349
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:51,186
So Jurassic World Creator Challenge was our first creator challenge and of course anytime you do

350
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:56,428
something there's something you could have done better and we knew we wanted this to be an ongoing

351
00:16:56,488 --> 00:17:02,629
series. So at the end of the summer we had to post-mortem to figure out where we needed to

352
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:06,270
iterate and how we would do that in our second creator challenge.

353
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:10,769
So we went through the different components

354
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:13,010
that we talked about earlier, the template, the tutorial,

355
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:17,852
as well as how was our actual in-house pipeline.

356
00:17:19,532 --> 00:17:21,093
And right away, when we're taking a look,

357
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,474
we start seeing these themes that come up.

358
00:17:23,954 --> 00:17:25,675
So in terms of the tutorial content,

359
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,176
this is the most important theme.

360
00:17:28,236 --> 00:17:30,517
There's just too much content.

361
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:34,699
So our first time, we created over 79 Google Doc pages

362
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:35,579
worth of content.

363
00:17:36,261 --> 00:17:37,922
That was a little gung-ho on our part

364
00:17:38,002 --> 00:17:39,803
for people who are new to development.

365
00:17:39,883 --> 00:17:41,924
Remember, these are people who just wanted to try it out.

366
00:17:42,304 --> 00:17:44,145
They weren't necessarily sold on it yet.

367
00:17:46,306 --> 00:17:48,848
Which leads me, this is probably my biggest takeaway

368
00:17:48,888 --> 00:17:50,989
from that, when you're creating content,

369
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:52,950
ask who you're writing for,

370
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:56,152
what your desired goal for is for the learner,

371
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,994
and then how long do you actually want them to take on it?

372
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:02,001
So for our first creator challenge,

373
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:06,063
we were crystal clear about who our intended audience was

374
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:07,283
and what our goal was.

375
00:18:07,943 --> 00:18:09,924
We wanted to attract people who had never tried game

376
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:10,664
development before.

377
00:18:10,684 --> 00:18:14,285
We wanted them to try it out and hopefully become game developers

378
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:14,646
someday.

379
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:16,566
But we hadn't thought about how long

380
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:17,467
did we want to spend on it.

381
00:18:17,547 --> 00:18:18,167
And people would ask.

382
00:18:18,207 --> 00:18:19,587
We're like, I don't know, a whole weekend.

383
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:21,608
It'd be great, as long as they want.

384
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:24,669
But we were delivering a full course meal

385
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:26,529
when what we should have been doing

386
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,390
was handing out a Costco sampler.

387
00:18:29,812 --> 00:18:31,554
And then you know how you ever try a Costco sampler

388
00:18:31,574 --> 00:18:33,315
and you're like, sure, whatever, vegan lasagna,

389
00:18:33,355 --> 00:18:35,337
and you're not vegan, but then suddenly you're going home

390
00:18:35,357 --> 00:18:36,658
with a vegetarian lasagna?

391
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:39,020
That's kind of what we were hoping would happen,

392
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,921
but we were just like being like, lasagna, go!

393
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:41,722
And they're like, ah.

394
00:18:44,565 --> 00:18:45,766
Thanks for laughing, I appreciate it.

395
00:18:48,968 --> 00:18:50,830
So for our second creator challenge,

396
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,371
our story game creator challenge,

397
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:55,434
we were much more clear about what our goal was.

398
00:18:58,564 --> 00:19:00,685
Once again, our audience was ages 10 and up,

399
00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:02,466
people who were new to game development.

400
00:19:03,106 --> 00:19:04,686
We want them to consider it as a career

401
00:19:04,706 --> 00:19:05,707
and get excited about it.

402
00:19:06,507 --> 00:19:09,208
And this time, we chose a specific time range

403
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,889
that we want them to be able to learn all the concepts in.

404
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,711
We chose 40 minutes, and the reason for that

405
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:17,432
is because a standard classroom is 50 minutes,

406
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:20,893
and there's also hour of code that happens every year.

407
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,854
So we wanted to create an activity

408
00:19:22,874 --> 00:19:24,054
that if a teacher wanted to,

409
00:19:24,515 --> 00:19:25,915
they could adapt into a classroom.

410
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:30,998
And within 50 minutes, the students first write a story

411
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:34,381
by hand, so they're getting a little pre-production there,

412
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:37,083
and then they use code for the very first time,

413
00:19:37,123 --> 00:19:39,846
they type it out in Lua, to ask players questions

414
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:41,487
and get their input and store it in variables.

415
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,969
They then take the player's input

416
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,651
and they put gaps into their story

417
00:19:47,072 --> 00:19:48,213
and they concatenate together.

418
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:49,734
Does this sound familiar to anybody?

419
00:19:52,356 --> 00:19:52,697
What is it?

420
00:19:56,432 --> 00:19:57,433
It's extremely popular.

421
00:19:57,453 --> 00:20:01,797
So we created this lost word style game

422
00:20:01,837 --> 00:20:04,039
that has a more well-known title.

423
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,982
And it went over pretty well with both our younger testers

424
00:20:08,002 --> 00:20:08,903
and our older testers.

425
00:20:09,463 --> 00:20:12,205
And it was great because a teacher could control

426
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:13,607
how much time a student went through it,

427
00:20:13,747 --> 00:20:17,270
but at the end, anyone who wanted to keep writing more,

428
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,411
they could just keep going with the concept

429
00:20:19,431 --> 00:20:20,953
they knew already to internalize it.

430
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:26,104
And the great thing about focusing on the content

431
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:29,626
that we were creating was that our completion rates

432
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:30,687
went way up.

433
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:33,688
So on our first much longer creator challenge,

434
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:37,250
we had really strong portions, but no matter what we did,

435
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,991
if it's gonna be that long,

436
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:41,132
you're gonna get a really drastic fall off.

437
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:43,793
But when we made it shorter.

438
00:20:45,092 --> 00:20:47,253
basically all of our content was being used more.

439
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:48,914
And what was more interesting,

440
00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:50,835
even for the equivalent amount of content,

441
00:20:51,455 --> 00:20:53,296
we're actually still getting better completion rates

442
00:20:53,956 --> 00:20:56,998
because they felt like it wasn't just going on forever,

443
00:20:57,078 --> 00:20:58,798
they could see where things ended a little bit better.

444
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,960
So it was just much more manageable for people.

445
00:21:05,442 --> 00:21:09,663
All right, so the second area of our content.

446
00:21:10,118 --> 00:21:11,778
we found out we were having issues.

447
00:21:11,818 --> 00:21:13,479
It wasn't so much like our steps,

448
00:21:13,719 --> 00:21:15,580
people weren't reporting a lot of issues there.

449
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,701
But because it was so long,

450
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:21,062
and because this is self-paced,

451
00:21:22,262 --> 00:21:24,823
what we were realizing was we didn't really allow

452
00:21:24,903 --> 00:21:26,223
for stopping and starting,

453
00:21:27,264 --> 00:21:28,444
or for starting over.

454
00:21:28,464 --> 00:21:31,805
So, one of my recommendations is

455
00:21:31,925 --> 00:21:33,506
if you happen to be doing online content,

456
00:21:34,175 --> 00:21:37,038
I'm actually not a big fan of locking things sequentially,

457
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:40,062
but also make sure you're allowing people

458
00:21:40,162 --> 00:21:44,326
to know what comes next and get back to it later.

459
00:21:44,747 --> 00:21:47,630
So all we did was we added in a TOC.

460
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,412
We added it in after we launched.

461
00:21:50,012 --> 00:21:51,254
And as soon as we did that,

462
00:21:51,274 --> 00:21:53,756
one of the benefits was if someone took a break,

463
00:21:54,177 --> 00:21:55,538
they can get back to where they left off.

464
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,731
They also had a clue as to how much was left in the lesson.

465
00:22:00,391 --> 00:22:02,432
Because if you don't know how much longer you're

466
00:22:02,452 --> 00:22:04,513
doing anything, you feel really lost.

467
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:06,373
If you ever get in a car and someone's just like,

468
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:07,753
turn left, turn right, turn left,

469
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:09,674
but they don't tell you you go into the grocery store,

470
00:22:10,334 --> 00:22:11,174
you don't like that.

471
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,975
So you want to have an idea of how long you're

472
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:15,696
going to be spending on content and how much you have left.

473
00:22:15,916 --> 00:22:16,816
You get a sense of progression.

474
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:25,158
So the next area we took a look at was the template itself.

475
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:29,855
So the template was huge.

476
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:34,079
So we actually spent a lot of time on wayfinding,

477
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:35,720
and we kept having to create these maps

478
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,321
to show you where to put different sections.

479
00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:40,484
If you see way on the left side or your right side,

480
00:22:40,604 --> 00:22:42,665
that's where you start it, up at the top of volcano.

481
00:22:42,685 --> 00:22:43,926
Then you had to get blue,

482
00:22:44,267 --> 00:22:45,648
then you had to get through the volcano,

483
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:48,050
then you had to get across these rocks.

484
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,852
And at the same time, you're placing objects,

485
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:52,433
you're coding, you're doing all these things.

486
00:22:53,734 --> 00:22:54,755
It just was too much.

487
00:22:56,393 --> 00:22:57,715
And that's what we just kept hearing.

488
00:22:57,755 --> 00:22:59,616
It was too much, it took too much time

489
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:02,759
to actually navigate in 3D space.

490
00:23:03,239 --> 00:23:04,780
If you're new to 3D game design,

491
00:23:05,401 --> 00:23:07,202
it's not as intuitive as if, you know,

492
00:23:07,362 --> 00:23:09,244
most of us have been doing it for years.

493
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:11,866
So physically just having to zoom around

494
00:23:12,467 --> 00:23:14,769
was distracting to the lessons we were trying to teach.

495
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:20,233
As well as, we kept having to put in more wayfinding

496
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:23,356
into the template itself, because people were getting lost,

497
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,496
didn't know where to complete

498
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:25,978
which sections of the tutorials.

499
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:31,230
So for our second Creator Challenge,

500
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,792
I gave a directive that I wanted to be able to cross

501
00:23:34,893 --> 00:23:37,034
the entire tutorial within five seconds.

502
00:23:37,775 --> 00:23:38,976
So on the left side,

503
00:23:38,996 --> 00:23:42,138
I have the Jurassic World Creator Challenge template,

504
00:23:42,498 --> 00:23:43,919
which is huge and I couldn't even get

505
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:45,921
into a single screenshot, it still cut off a little bit.

506
00:23:46,501 --> 00:23:49,523
And on the right side, that is the entirety of the template.

507
00:23:50,104 --> 00:23:52,165
So you drop into this library

508
00:23:52,185 --> 00:23:55,328
and I hope you know where you're supposed to be going.

509
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,988
This great big crystal clear, here's the lighting,

510
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,049
X marks the spot.

511
00:24:03,451 --> 00:24:04,912
So you go there, you click on the book,

512
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:08,034
and a GUI element pops up,

513
00:24:08,294 --> 00:24:10,636
and this is where you actually place your word game story.

514
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,441
So, and the result of having a much tighter environment

515
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:19,802
like that was, one, we got to spend a lot more time

516
00:24:19,862 --> 00:24:21,444
on the individual elements crafting it,

517
00:24:21,784 --> 00:24:23,965
but two, it was just a lot less distracting

518
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,486
from the concepts we were trying to teach.

519
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,149
So in the post-mortem, like I said,

520
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,330
we also talked a lot about the pipeline process.

521
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:36,072
So a few things that I have that we went through.

522
00:24:36,232 --> 00:24:38,213
It's hard to get meaningful tracking metrics.

523
00:24:38,313 --> 00:24:39,654
This is one thing that we struggle with.

524
00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:40,754
What is success?

525
00:24:41,435 --> 00:24:42,835
So if you do something like this,

526
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,196
if you want to create a tutorial,

527
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,477
try to think about is success

528
00:24:46,517 --> 00:24:48,478
if they get through the entirety of the content?

529
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:49,999
If you've got a lot of content,

530
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:52,360
is success if they make it through the first lesson?

531
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,241
Is it if they publish the game?

532
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:58,805
Because one thing we found, as we kind of changed the metrics of what we thought success was,

533
00:24:58,825 --> 00:25:03,410
at one point we're like, oh my gosh, published games. That means we have done it. New games

534
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:07,674
published based off the template. But with the second creator challenge, even though we had

535
00:25:08,615 --> 00:25:12,338
exponentially higher completion rates and people seemed to like it much better,

536
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:14,060
we had much lower publishing rates.

537
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:18,278
And our theory for that is for the first Creator Challenge,

538
00:25:18,318 --> 00:25:20,700
Jurassic World, it got to the end and it was like, you win.

539
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:23,163
So they were like, okay, we're done, we publish now.

540
00:25:23,803 --> 00:25:25,124
For our second Creator Challenge,

541
00:25:25,385 --> 00:25:27,627
we intentionally built it so they could learn concepts

542
00:25:27,647 --> 00:25:28,628
within a short amount of time,

543
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:31,271
but then they're going to have to expand upon it

544
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:33,553
and they weren't publishing it

545
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,654
because they just had to keep working.

546
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,861
There's also things within it,

547
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:39,262
like if you're working with an IP partner,

548
00:25:39,362 --> 00:25:40,803
make sure you're building in time

549
00:25:41,184 --> 00:25:42,425
to work with that IP partner,

550
00:25:42,745 --> 00:25:45,107
like sending approvals back and forth takes time,

551
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,350
as well as we got requests for localized content.

552
00:25:49,311 --> 00:25:51,092
One more thing, we got a lot of feedback

553
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,593
that we just couldn't do anything about.

554
00:25:53,314 --> 00:25:54,395
One thing that was really interesting

555
00:25:54,415 --> 00:25:55,316
is we kept getting complaints

556
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:56,897
that six-year-olds couldn't reach all the keys,

557
00:25:57,437 --> 00:25:58,398
which I thought was super cute.

558
00:25:58,418 --> 00:26:01,161
It was like, your six-year-olds are coding in Lua?

559
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:01,681
What?

560
00:26:04,987 --> 00:26:06,448
There's nothing we can do to fix that.

561
00:26:06,528 --> 00:26:08,569
Six-year-olds were not our intended audience,

562
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:10,770
but I think it was really awesome that they were trying.

563
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,071
I did feel really bad when their parents were like,

564
00:26:13,211 --> 00:26:14,631
what can you do, what can we do?

565
00:26:14,651 --> 00:26:16,372
It's like, wait a couple years.

566
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:20,293
We do actually have some great partners though

567
00:26:20,313 --> 00:26:21,474
that do some visual scripting.

568
00:26:23,354 --> 00:26:25,475
So if you've got four takeaways from this.

569
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:28,929
Like, please remember, more content is not always better.

570
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,171
Really think about who your audience is,

571
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:32,892
what they're gonna get out of it,

572
00:26:33,612 --> 00:26:35,453
and how long do you want them to spend on it.

573
00:26:36,974 --> 00:26:38,595
Motivate your learners with theming

574
00:26:38,855 --> 00:26:39,836
and narrative and rewards,

575
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:42,677
but don't just throw that at images.

576
00:26:42,757 --> 00:26:44,218
Actually work that narrative and theming

577
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:45,779
into the project as much as possible.

578
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,461
Allow for self-expression

579
00:26:49,061 --> 00:26:51,062
so that they can actually internalize the concepts

580
00:26:51,102 --> 00:26:52,443
and get some agency over it.

581
00:26:52,463 --> 00:26:54,664
It'll be much more satisfying to them if they do.

582
00:26:55,575 --> 00:26:57,457
And don't just keep ramping up the difficulty.

583
00:26:57,577 --> 00:26:59,759
Really think about how you're placing those concepts,

584
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:03,762
both for the terms of difficulty and for actual enjoyment level.

585
00:27:06,685 --> 00:27:08,727
So that's my talk.

586
00:27:08,767 --> 00:27:11,589
I think we have three minutes left, something like that.

587
00:27:11,689 --> 00:27:13,251
So if anyone has any questions, I

588
00:27:13,271 --> 00:27:14,832
can take maybe one or two questions.

589
00:27:20,076 --> 00:27:20,357
OK.

590
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,358
Does anyone have a question?

591
00:27:25,151 --> 00:27:25,911
Hey, look up back there.

592
00:27:31,715 --> 00:27:33,997
When you mentioned publishing the game,

593
00:27:34,157 --> 00:27:36,919
is that something they can share with friends

594
00:27:36,939 --> 00:27:38,039
like in the actual Roblox game?

595
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,380
Yeah, yeah.

596
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,722
So when we say publishing, you could publish privately

597
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:44,544
or you can publish publicly to the entirety world

598
00:27:44,624 --> 00:27:51,388
and to Xbox, all of it, PS Max, PC Max, and all that.

599
00:27:51,728 --> 00:27:51,788
OK.

600
00:27:55,868 --> 00:28:02,893
So on the topic of self-expression, so I work with 8 to 12 year olds, I teach game design through Roblox

601
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:06,956
and something that they love playing around with is the toolbox

602
00:28:07,376 --> 00:28:12,060
but the problem is that it does so much and it's so easy to just drag and drop in that

603
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,822
like when I'm trying to teach them to build something, they just end up getting distracted

604
00:28:15,922 --> 00:28:18,684
and start throwing Lamborghinis into their world

605
00:28:18,984 --> 00:28:24,708
So what are your thoughts on that? Should we like maybe only allow toolbox at the end or like, yeah

606
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:26,731
So there's a few things you can do.

607
00:28:26,912 --> 00:28:30,921
You can X the toolbox out if you have an image that you're

608
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:33,506
using, or before they start, make them exit out of it.

609
00:28:33,807 --> 00:28:34,989
They are going to find it, however.

610
00:28:35,762 --> 00:28:39,005
So depending on your classroom, you could just say that we're not using it,

611
00:28:39,025 --> 00:28:42,468
we're going to be using it later, or you have to complete X amount of stuff,

612
00:28:42,508 --> 00:28:43,710
and then you can add in what you'd like.

613
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:48,634
I also found having how to use the toolbox safely and wisely,

614
00:28:48,674 --> 00:28:49,915
like turning it into a lesson.

615
00:28:49,975 --> 00:28:52,618
Like, OK, don't just throw in helicopters for the fun of it

616
00:28:52,718 --> 00:28:54,299
if you've got like a magical fairy land.

617
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,624
So teaching them how to effectively use the toolbox can help channel that.

618
00:29:00,685 --> 00:29:00,925
Awesome.

619
00:29:01,753 --> 00:29:03,415
And I have a second question if you don't mind.

620
00:29:04,396 --> 00:29:07,059
So some of the things in Roblox, like for example,

621
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,382
being a checkpoint is not entirely intuitive

622
00:29:09,442 --> 00:29:11,145
with the teams and the colors and whatnot.

623
00:29:11,505 --> 00:29:14,629
So have you found any good ways of reinforcing concepts?

624
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:17,052
So like they do the tutorial, they see it was,

625
00:29:17,412 --> 00:29:19,054
but like kids, they forget quickly, so.

626
00:29:19,395 --> 00:29:22,376
You have to just let them do it again and again.

627
00:29:22,716 --> 00:29:25,698
So both kids and adults, we don't remember things

628
00:29:25,738 --> 00:29:26,638
the first time we do it.

629
00:29:26,718 --> 00:29:28,139
And that's part of why you have to think

630
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,139
of those progression curves.

631
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,080
Think about how can I do an object,

632
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,461
or do something and then do it again and do it again.

633
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:37,543
Or maybe honestly, creating checkpoints

634
00:29:37,703 --> 00:29:40,525
isn't so much important as whatever

635
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,625
the mechanic is behind it.

636
00:29:42,065 --> 00:29:43,886
So you just have to decide, is that something

637
00:29:43,906 --> 00:29:45,387
like you want them to actually internalize it,

638
00:29:45,447 --> 00:29:46,888
or is it fine that they just did it and forgot?

639
00:29:53,857 --> 00:29:54,318
Anyone else?

640
00:29:56,626 --> 00:29:56,867
OK.

641
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:59,094
So thank you guys very, very much.

642
00:29:59,114 --> 00:30:00,840
I appreciate it.
