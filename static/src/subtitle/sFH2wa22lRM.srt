1
00:00:06,205 --> 00:00:07,787
Hello, good afternoon and welcome.

2
00:00:08,268 --> 00:00:09,269
Thank you for coming.

3
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:11,673
I'm pleased to see a crowd this big,

4
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:12,835
considering that we're opposite

5
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,417
the experimental gameplay workshop.

6
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:17,942
You're probably all people who couldn't get in, right?

7
00:00:17,962 --> 00:00:20,025
I was just gonna make that joke.

8
00:00:20,065 --> 00:00:20,626
That's not funny.

9
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,042
My name is Ernest Adams.

10
00:00:25,102 --> 00:00:26,483
I'm going to be the moderator today.

11
00:00:27,264 --> 00:00:29,726
And I've been instructed to give you the same instructions

12
00:00:29,766 --> 00:00:32,008
that you've been hearing all week long, namely,

13
00:00:32,688 --> 00:00:35,791
please turn off cell phones and other noise-making devices.

14
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:38,493
Apparently, this has proven to be a problem in the past

15
00:00:38,553 --> 00:00:40,095
because game developers don't listen

16
00:00:40,135 --> 00:00:41,256
and don't obey instructions.

17
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:50,160
And also, please be sure to check your email for the feedback form so that you can fill

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,422
out your feedback about our panel after it's over.

19
00:00:55,943 --> 00:01:00,244
I think, oh yes, and there's something about please no unauthorized filming.

20
00:01:01,065 --> 00:01:04,746
You can film the slides if you want, but there's only one slide and you're looking at it.

21
00:01:05,487 --> 00:01:05,667
So.

22
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:06,727
We're very prepared.

23
00:01:06,747 --> 00:01:06,807
Yes.

24
00:01:06,927 --> 00:01:07,248
Thank you.

25
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:14,533
Right, so before I introduce our panelists, I'm going to start with an anecdote.

26
00:01:15,094 --> 00:01:21,618
I used to work at Electronic Arts for EA Sports, and about 1995, I went to one of the big shot

27
00:01:21,658 --> 00:01:24,600
executive producers at EA Sports, and I said, I've got a brilliant idea.

28
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:28,622
I said, let's make a game about horses.

29
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:30,863
There are a lot of horse sports.

30
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:34,524
There's rodeo, and dressage, and show jumping,

31
00:01:34,564 --> 00:01:36,544
and cross country, and flat racing,

32
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:38,425
and all kinds of other stuff like that.

33
00:01:38,785 --> 00:01:42,686
And if we do that, we will own every little girl

34
00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:46,487
between the age of 9 and 12 in the world.

35
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:52,249
And he, of course, the executive producer, was a he, said, no,

36
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:52,669
no, no.

37
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:53,889
Girls don't play video games.

38
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,393
And I said, well, they might play video games

39
00:01:57,473 --> 00:01:59,455
if there were some games they wanted to play.

40
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:01,757
And he said, no, no, no.

41
00:02:01,837 --> 00:02:02,678
We don't like girls.

42
00:02:02,738 --> 00:02:03,759
We don't know about girls.

43
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:04,760
We don't care about girls.

44
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,881
We're not interested in girls.

45
00:02:06,222 --> 00:02:06,602
Go away.

46
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:06,922
Shut up.

47
00:02:06,962 --> 00:02:07,483
Do your job.

48
00:02:08,724 --> 00:02:09,745
And so that was the end of that.

49
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:14,810
That Christmas, what happens? Out comes Barbie Horse Riding Adventure.

50
00:02:16,311 --> 00:02:17,713
It is colossal.

51
00:02:18,754 --> 00:02:22,197
And one week it was the biggest selling PC game on the charts.

52
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:25,700
You know, outstripping all the shoot-em-ups and everything else.

53
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:28,102
And, you know, we could have had that money.

54
00:02:28,363 --> 00:02:30,445
Now admittedly, we didn't have the Barbie name.

55
00:02:31,506 --> 00:02:34,270
which was kind of, I think, partly key to its success.

56
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:37,876
But that, you know, gives you an idea of the attitude that was floating around at the time

57
00:02:37,996 --> 00:02:40,520
among the conventional big publishers.

58
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,744
It's just, you know, games are a boy thing.

59
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:44,366
We're not interested.

60
00:02:47,314 --> 00:02:50,896
But, obviously, as you know, there were a number of girl games that were made in the

61
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:53,699
90s, and many of them were made by these people.

62
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,180
So let me introduce our panelists.

63
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,563
You have the privilege of being with some of the heaviest hitters in game design.

64
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:05,688
We will start with the far end, Sherry Grainer Ray, who is currently a senior designer at

65
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:09,371
Electronic Arts, formerly director of product development at Her Interactive.

66
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:21,784
Next is Jessica Durchin-Schnipp, who is currently director of girls' creative content at Mattel,

67
00:03:22,304 --> 00:03:26,266
and the person who was behind some of the early Barbie games, and she gave an absolutely

68
00:03:26,387 --> 00:03:32,330
fabulous lecture at the Game Developers Conference about 20 years ago.

69
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,955
The content of which I scribbled down as fast as I could and ripped off for my book on game

70
00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:43,076
design.

71
00:03:43,736 --> 00:03:44,897
And then, yes.

72
00:03:50,308 --> 00:03:53,330
Brenda Laurel, who should need no introduction at all,

73
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:57,433
currently owner of Neogayan Design Strategy Consultancy

74
00:03:57,914 --> 00:03:59,355
and a founder of Purple Moon,

75
00:03:59,715 --> 00:04:01,156
one of the most highly publicized

76
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:03,138
of the 90s games for girls publishers.

77
00:04:09,843 --> 00:04:11,083
And finally, Laura Gruppy,

78
00:04:11,644 --> 00:04:13,685
former president of Girl Games Incorporated

79
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:16,808
and now president of Girls Intelligence Agency

80
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:19,110
providing marketing and PR information.

81
00:04:25,147 --> 00:04:30,829
So I'm going to do as little talking as possible so that they can deliver you as much wisdom

82
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:31,969
as they have.

83
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:40,252
But I do want you to expand on your introductions just a little bit by saying briefly what you

84
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:45,014
were actually building, the names of the titles and things that the people would remember

85
00:04:45,114 --> 00:04:46,934
here from that era.

86
00:04:47,994 --> 00:04:51,075
So start it with Cherry.

87
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:54,196
Okay, I was head of product development for Her Interactive.

88
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:54,577
We did.

89
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:57,494
McKinsey and Company was our first title.

90
00:04:57,674 --> 00:05:00,036
It was, we built it as a social adventure,

91
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:02,537
which sounded really weird to people back then,

92
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:04,779
but today would be considered a normal title.

93
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:08,121
We also did a Vampire Diaries title based on the license,

94
00:05:08,161 --> 00:05:10,002
and then we moved over into doing Nancy Drew.

95
00:05:10,023 --> 00:05:12,744
I did wanna say we did ask Megan Geiser

96
00:05:12,764 --> 00:05:14,366
to join us at this panel,

97
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:16,127
but she was unable to attend the conference this year,

98
00:05:16,147 --> 00:05:17,788
so we're going, we miss having Megan here.

99
00:05:18,268 --> 00:05:19,449
So anyway, that's what I did.

100
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:23,325
Let's see, so I started in 1995 at Mattel,

101
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:25,826
and my first project was Barbie Fashion Designer.

102
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:29,567
And then consequently, I did almost every Barbie game.

103
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:32,047
I'm not horseback riding or magic hair styler.

104
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:33,508
There were some other producers I worked with,

105
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:35,748
but towards the end in 2000, I left,

106
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:39,189
and I had been the executive producer of Girl Games.

107
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:41,909
But I went on to found a company

108
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:43,990
that was dedicated to social gaming for girls

109
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,990
called Digital Play Space,

110
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,051
and maybe you guys played Digital Dollhouse

111
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:47,991
at one time or another.

112
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:48,971
And that was my game too.

113
00:05:51,447 --> 00:06:02,154
I got hired by Interval Research in 1992 and my job was to do research on girls in technology.

114
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:06,917
We discovered obviously that girls weren't getting their share of technology education

115
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:13,181
for various reasons and we did a huge research project for four years on girls and play.

116
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:21,359
And during the course of that decided that, gosh, we could do some computer games that might get girls' hands on this tech.

117
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,445
So we founded Purple Moon. The first products were Rockets New School and Secret Paths in the Forest.

118
00:06:29,106 --> 00:06:38,594
We went on to do ten titles, more titles in the Rocket series, more titles in the Secret Paths series, and our last title was Starfire Soccer Challenge.

119
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:44,702
So they're all so much older.

120
00:06:44,802 --> 00:06:45,463
I just started.

121
00:06:45,743 --> 00:06:48,587
This is great.

122
00:06:48,887 --> 00:06:52,972
I started Girl Games with a grant from the National Science

123
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:55,354
Foundation in partnership with Rice University

124
00:06:55,835 --> 00:06:59,519
to investigate how to pull girls into technology.

125
00:07:00,215 --> 00:07:02,537
and that founded Girl Games.

126
00:07:03,397 --> 00:07:09,722
And we were very evidence-based in trying to come up

127
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:11,023
with ideas for content.

128
00:07:11,604 --> 00:07:14,546
And we were based in Austin and worked for Jessica.

129
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,511
on many occasions.

130
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:24,314
Our methodology was doing slumber parties around the country, because that was a way

131
00:07:24,354 --> 00:07:26,775
that we felt like girls were already gathering together.

132
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:33,298
And that informed a lot of our ideas for content development.

133
00:07:33,398 --> 00:07:36,499
And then we worked with Mattel.

134
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,983
Sony and Activision and did original titles as well as licensed titles.

135
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:50,406
And so, and then that morphed into doing more and more research, which is what I have now.

136
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:52,487
GIA, Girls Intelligence Agency.

137
00:07:54,488 --> 00:07:55,209
Okay, thank you.

138
00:07:59,431 --> 00:08:00,071
We're so glad.

139
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,252
Forgive me for popping up and down like a jack-in-a-box.

140
00:08:04,632 --> 00:08:07,055
Um, my back is not what it used to be.

141
00:08:08,256 --> 00:08:09,737
You can ignore me, pay attention to them.

142
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:12,620
You mentioned that your work was evidence-based,

143
00:08:13,181 --> 00:08:15,863
and, you know, that's a really weird concept to the game industry,

144
00:08:16,344 --> 00:08:18,706
where most of us think, you know,

145
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,768
oh, we're artistes and, you know,

146
00:08:21,489 --> 00:08:23,070
we create from our heart and so on,

147
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,052
but both you and Purple Moon.

148
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:29,034
were very much into evidence-based design.

149
00:08:29,554 --> 00:08:32,415
And I wanted to ask Brenda, or start by asking Brenda,

150
00:08:32,435 --> 00:08:36,457
and move on to any others who have something to say about it.

151
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,818
What was your goal with the research that led to Purple Moon,

152
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:42,979
and how did that change over time?

153
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:44,640
Oh, good question.

154
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:48,641
So our goal was to understand...

155
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:52,945
what was going on with girls and boys and play.

156
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:57,306
There was this, at the time, $6 billion business with an

157
00:08:57,346 --> 00:09:01,107
empty lot next door where girls might be playing things.

158
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,527
So we felt that it was important to meet girls where

159
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:04,067
they were.

160
00:09:04,607 --> 00:09:09,408
So originally, the research was aimed at understanding how

161
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:10,328
girls play.

162
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:13,589
Because if you'd ask the question, why don't girls play

163
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:15,569
computer games, you would not get a useful answer.

164
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:17,810
But if you ask the question.

165
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,115
how do girls play? You might get a useful answer.

166
00:09:21,596 --> 00:09:25,725
So that's what we ended up looking at. Our original goal was about computer

167
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:26,246
literacy.

168
00:09:26,897 --> 00:09:30,678
It was about giving girls their fair share of hands-on with technology.

169
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:37,122
But as an inveterate feminist, as time moved on, and I started hearing the stories of these

170
00:09:37,182 --> 00:09:40,183
kids, it became really important to me.

171
00:09:40,263 --> 00:09:46,366
I got a heart engagement, I guess, with what we were learning, that it's such a tough time

172
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:48,547
of life for girls, being a tween.

173
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:51,268
They suffer from a lot of...

174
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:56,177
difficulties, one of the patterns we saw over and over was kind of a sense of

175
00:09:56,297 --> 00:10:01,906
social inevitability about what happened to them, that you have to work to get

176
00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:04,110
over as a young girl. We learned a lot of things about

177
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:06,812
social status and play patterns and things.

178
00:10:07,393 --> 00:10:12,876
And it then became more my mission to understand how we

179
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:16,998
might create emotional rehearsal space for a lot of

180
00:10:17,038 --> 00:10:20,900
different kinds of girls to get over that hump of between

181
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,081
being a kid and being a teenager.

182
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:27,324
And we were really interested in recognizing and representing

183
00:10:27,364 --> 00:10:29,965
the diversity of the girls that we interviewed.

184
00:10:35,273 --> 00:10:37,694
Sorry, please, jump in.

185
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:41,736
And we took that learning and turned it into money.

186
00:10:41,836 --> 00:10:46,958
So it was funny starting in Barbie because I actually got the job because my resume was

187
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:50,360
stuck to another person's resume and put through the fax machine.

188
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,041
Fax machine for all of you who don't know what faxes are.

189
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:54,241
It's a machine and it would take, you know.

190
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:59,184
And I remember Nancy Martin, who was the executive producer at the time, who also should be up

191
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:00,464
here and I haven't heard from her in a while.

192
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:04,809
She was like, I think your name is spelled so weird.

193
00:11:04,849 --> 00:11:08,133
And her name's N-A-N-C-I-E, and I am J-E-S-Y-C-A.

194
00:11:08,574 --> 00:11:10,957
And that was reason enough for me to get the job at Mattel.

195
00:11:11,477 --> 00:11:13,921
So if you think that it has to be about your resume things,

196
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:14,421
you're like, eh.

197
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:19,674
But we were taking that knowledge and saying, okay, we know that this is happening.

198
00:11:19,854 --> 00:11:20,754
I'm an anomaly.

199
00:11:20,874 --> 00:11:22,095
I had a computer in 1978.

200
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,836
And if anybody wants to buy it, it's in our garage.

201
00:11:26,796 --> 00:11:28,817
And it was like, it's like this big.

202
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:34,439
But I was one of the first kids to ever play Zelda because it was just a text-based game.

203
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:39,281
And so my whole life I was like, okay, girls play with games because I played with games.

204
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:41,982
And then we started talking about this research.

205
00:11:42,222 --> 00:11:44,564
And I was just happy to be at Mattel because I'm a Barbie

206
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,185
freak, and so I had to dress up all my dolls for each

207
00:11:47,245 --> 00:11:48,806
meeting, and it was great.

208
00:11:49,266 --> 00:11:50,987
And they were like, no, we really think that there is a

209
00:11:51,088 --> 00:11:52,508
reason, there's a purpose for this.

210
00:11:53,109 --> 00:11:55,510
And not everybody knows this, but Fashion Designer was not

211
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,891
created internally.

212
00:11:57,111 --> 00:12:01,093
It was actually created by a seven-year-old, EJ, EJ

213
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:04,235
Rifkin, who was the daughter of my boss, who was kind of

214
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:04,435
our boss.

215
00:12:05,463 --> 00:12:06,684
our genius in house.

216
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:10,145
And his whole point, which I think goes off of what Brenda

217
00:12:10,165 --> 00:12:12,506
is saying, was not to create a game for girls.

218
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,247
Have no difference between you're playing with your Barbie

219
00:12:16,267 --> 00:12:19,108
on your kitchen floor and a computer, that it should be a

220
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,269
seamless interaction.

221
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:23,770
Because girls were sensitive to barriers, and you just

222
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,451
wanted to be fun and sort of that simple transfer.

223
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:30,012
So it's not like, oh my god, I'm putting in a CD-ROM.

224
00:12:30,092 --> 00:12:30,712
What is this?

225
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,653
It's just the extension of play.

226
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,733
So that was really Mattel's philosophy.

227
00:12:35,147 --> 00:12:35,788
in those first years.

228
00:12:44,121 --> 00:12:50,264
Patricia Flanagan, and she had kind of a combined family with, I think it was eight or nine

229
00:12:50,324 --> 00:12:55,907
kids, and she recognized that her daughters were not playing the games that American Laser

230
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:59,129
Games, the parent company, was not playing the games that American Laser Games were making.

231
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:03,751
And she was like, this is a huge marketing opportunity, this is a huge market that needs

232
00:13:03,811 --> 00:13:05,732
to be just waiting.

233
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:11,875
And so she set out to try to fill that gap or build the building on the empty lot.

234
00:13:12,732 --> 00:13:16,855
and found me at a GDC, where I was working as a CA, by the way,

235
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:21,199
and interviewed me and brought me in to head up and help her

236
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:22,019
get this game out.

237
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,382
We worked with the Albuquerque Independent School District.

238
00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:27,223
We had 3,000 girls that we worked with.

239
00:13:27,603 --> 00:13:30,005
And we brought in what we called our design team.

240
00:13:30,065 --> 00:13:34,649
And we had them pick out their leaders.

241
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:35,469
And we brought them in.

242
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:39,592
And they absolutely directed the design on the McKinsey and

243
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:40,353
Company title.

244
00:13:41,246 --> 00:13:44,487
And we got a lot of kickback from it about, this is just stereotypes,

245
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:46,667
you're just doing fashion, what's wrong with you, you people,

246
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:47,827
you're doing terrible things.

247
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:50,648
And we kept saying, but this is what the girls asked for.

248
00:13:50,728 --> 00:13:53,189
We're doing what they wanted us to do in their game.

249
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:58,650
And we got boxes and boxes of letters thanking us for doing a game for them.

250
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,610
And so that made it all worthwhile.

251
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:10,883
Yeah, I think it's not uncommon for in a more typical general

252
00:14:10,923 --> 00:14:17,428
fashion that we find ourselves having to defend our position

253
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:22,191
and needing to go out and collect the data to prove that

254
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:24,593
this is a demographic worth selling to.

255
00:14:25,153 --> 00:14:28,856
And then ultimately large commercial successes occurred so

256
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:31,638
that that just kind of kept building on itself.

257
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:32,158
And.

258
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:39,208
And arguably, today, look at this audience.

259
00:14:39,248 --> 00:14:40,530
This didn't exist before.

260
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:44,754
And so the population, we've done a tremendous job,

261
00:14:44,975 --> 00:14:45,815
from what I can tell.

262
00:14:45,835 --> 00:14:50,501
Albeit, what I'm seeing is it's leading this conversation

263
00:14:50,521 --> 00:14:50,921
towards.

264
00:14:55,826 --> 00:14:59,069
this inclusion and diversification of gameplay.

265
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:03,372
And I think that's important for an industry that is this large

266
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:06,114
that has been able to make so much money off

267
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:10,718
of a fairly narrow gameplay design scope.

268
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,060
And so I feel like way, way back in the 90s

269
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:17,323
and probably the gamers before us are saying the same thing,

270
00:15:17,363 --> 00:15:21,346
like the iterations that you're seeing in the creative,

271
00:15:23,388 --> 00:15:28,211
diversity that you're seeing is a part of the evolution of the industry and our voice

272
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:33,074
is a particular voice and we needed to find out, you know, what does this consumer want

273
00:15:33,114 --> 00:15:37,517
so that we could start to feed that consumer, to make the money, to prove to the publishers

274
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:42,861
that this is worth investing in. And so I think that groundwork has definitely been

275
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:43,221
laid.

276
00:15:44,462 --> 00:15:47,604
I felt, I should say something more in response.

277
00:15:50,474 --> 00:15:53,936
from my perspective as a second-generation feminist,

278
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:57,279
I felt then, and I kind of do now, apologies,

279
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,962
that there is something about, not just Barbie,

280
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:04,084
but the pink aisle in general,

281
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:08,427
that is a hegemonic representation

282
00:16:08,507 --> 00:16:10,268
of what women are supposed to be.

283
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:16,023
that it enforces the traditional stereotypes

284
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:18,744
in a pretty damaging way.

285
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,647
And so as time went by for me, you know,

286
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:24,828
I was the ugly smart kid with glasses.

287
00:16:24,868 --> 00:16:25,708
I knew all about this.

288
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:28,150
If you played the games, I was Mavis.

289
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:34,474
There needed to be a way for girls

290
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:37,595
to feel positive about themselves that

291
00:16:37,736 --> 00:16:39,196
wasn't part of that.

292
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:43,792
hegemonic understanding of what the feminine should be.

293
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:46,954
I felt it keenly as a kid growing up.

294
00:16:48,914 --> 00:16:52,116
And I saw it in the feelings of the girls I interviewed.

295
00:16:52,176 --> 00:16:57,238
So part of it, I think, for me was to present a balance,

296
00:16:58,299 --> 00:16:59,859
if you will, to the Pink Isle games

297
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,541
so that we had more of a range in the offering,

298
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:06,402
not as an instead of, but as an also.

299
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:09,403
And it's the also that's the important thing,

300
00:17:09,423 --> 00:17:10,704
because that was what was so weird.

301
00:17:11,326 --> 00:17:18,353
is that it's not, it's, it's, we didn't build the pink aisle.

302
00:17:18,373 --> 00:17:19,854
That's not us.

303
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:20,475
That's not us.

304
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:21,095
We didn't do that.

305
00:17:21,115 --> 00:17:22,236
Well, no, but, but no.

306
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:22,556
Maybe.

307
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:24,078
You built your product line.

308
00:17:24,238 --> 00:17:24,899
Which was pink.

309
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:26,720
But then they built everything else.

310
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,801
Yeah, but everything was pink.

311
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:29,263
And defined it.

312
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:29,463
Right.

313
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:31,184
It came, it came to define the market.

314
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,808
Rather, because, I mean, when fashion design came out.

315
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,153
We were all excited.

316
00:17:36,193 --> 00:17:38,854
This broke the door open for us because we've been fighting,

317
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,014
girls don't play games.

318
00:17:40,274 --> 00:17:42,595
And all of a sudden, the industry went, wow,

319
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:43,575
girls do play games.

320
00:17:43,615 --> 00:17:45,656
And then they said, get me some of that.

321
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:48,517
And we'd be like, OK, here's a horse game.

322
00:17:48,577 --> 00:17:50,358
Here's a detective game.

323
00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:51,618
And they went, no, no, no.

324
00:17:51,898 --> 00:17:53,679
We want Barbie.

325
00:17:53,719 --> 00:17:55,759
And we'd be going, only Barbie can be Barbie.

326
00:17:56,299 --> 00:17:58,500
Anything else we give you is not going to be Barbie.

327
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,421
And girls should have everything including.

328
00:18:03,202 --> 00:18:04,822
One of the things to break down in just that is.

329
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,637
The thing that they should have been saying is,

330
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:07,917
give us TV support.

331
00:18:08,137 --> 00:18:10,678
So Barbie Fashion Designer isn't about it just being

332
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:13,419
groundbreaking game and all kinds of things.

333
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:17,060
It was one of the first CD-ROMs to be

334
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,400
television advertised.

335
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,001
And people don't know, when it first came out, the first week

336
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,481
of sales, I remember being so nervous.

337
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:24,502
Like, how much did we do?

338
00:18:24,822 --> 00:18:25,602
We sold 11 copies.

339
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,480
Four of which my mother bought.

340
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,041
Even though she couldn't have played it, she was like,

341
00:18:31,062 --> 00:18:32,242
oh, I'll just take all of these.

342
00:18:32,683 --> 00:18:35,004
And she said, I felt bad, all the other games were like

343
00:18:35,084 --> 00:18:36,545
emptier than yours were just there.

344
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:38,827
And we went to our CEO,

345
00:18:39,447 --> 00:18:40,568
who was Jill Barard at the time,

346
00:18:40,908 --> 00:18:42,770
and I said, we gave a speech and said

347
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,712
what really needs to happen is we need TV advertising.

348
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:47,053
And she said, I'll never forget, she was like,

349
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,535
you know, I believe in this, and I have a personal fund.

350
00:18:50,086 --> 00:18:53,227
that I think we can do some experiments with TV advertising.

351
00:18:53,647 --> 00:18:55,327
And me being really young and naive,

352
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:56,868
I thought she was paying it out of her own pocket.

353
00:18:58,528 --> 00:18:59,388
You were fine with that.

354
00:18:59,428 --> 00:19:00,728
And I was like, wow.

355
00:19:00,969 --> 00:19:02,289
You didn't know Jill.

356
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:06,130
I was like, wow, she's really generous.

357
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,931
There's so much to unpack.

358
00:19:09,971 --> 00:19:11,891
You know, it's like you can talk about Barbie,

359
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:13,812
and we talk about having balance.

360
00:19:14,372 --> 00:19:16,252
To me, it was also always.

361
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:21,671
the balance between games that were all about death and destruction and games that are about

362
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,471
creativity.

363
00:19:23,152 --> 00:19:29,993
So for me, plus huge Barbie fan, played with Barbie until I was 16, really understood her

364
00:19:30,073 --> 00:19:37,154
as a brand and as sort of a dynamic expression as opposed to kind of putting her into a box

365
00:19:37,214 --> 00:19:39,195
and say this is her representation for most people.

366
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:43,536
I really felt like what we were doing was saying, okay, there's another option.

367
00:19:45,739 --> 00:19:48,342
was hard and a lot of times, still to this day,

368
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:49,905
you get people who are like,

369
00:19:50,145 --> 00:19:51,868
oh, it's Barbie and so it's these things.

370
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:53,616
And it wasn't.

371
00:19:53,756 --> 00:19:57,157
It was a lot of different people and different, an

372
00:19:57,217 --> 00:19:57,897
opportunity.

373
00:19:58,498 --> 00:20:01,239
It may just have been the one-time deal.

374
00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:03,860
We did television advertising too, and that might have been

375
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,201
the most fun part, which is representing what the games

376
00:20:07,281 --> 00:20:08,502
were in TV ads.

377
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,443
And I'm still very proud of those ads.

378
00:20:10,563 --> 00:20:12,023
And boy, you could tell the difference.

379
00:20:12,063 --> 00:20:15,245
We ended up in the top 100 with both of our launched

380
00:20:15,325 --> 00:20:17,165
games because of the television advertising.

381
00:20:17,185 --> 00:20:18,386
But no one ever talks about that.

382
00:20:19,086 --> 00:20:22,727
Nobody ever talks about the machine that is Mattel Marketing,

383
00:20:22,747 --> 00:20:24,007
that was Mattel Marketing.

384
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:26,487
My Mattel Marketing counterpart is sitting out there, she's like,

385
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:27,568
okay, yes.

386
00:20:29,688 --> 00:20:31,588
But it was, it was both at the same time,

387
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:33,889
and I think that what's true of a lot of games now

388
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:37,029
is that you can't get past all this noise.

389
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:38,450
There is no way.

390
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,470
There's a game for every niche group,

391
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,630
every type of play pattern,

392
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,111
but how do you actually get seen,

393
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:45,271
and then how does that become a...

394
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:48,911
of movement, it's different.

395
00:20:49,411 --> 00:20:50,932
We didn't have any TV advertising.

396
00:20:52,353 --> 00:20:55,856
There's also, it seems to me that there's such a paucity of

397
00:20:57,777 --> 00:21:02,341
diversity in play patterns in shooters and war games and...

398
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,021
You know, it's like, don't you guys get bored with that shit?

399
00:21:07,101 --> 00:21:09,101
I mean, you're doing the same thing over and over.

400
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:14,162
So having play patterns that are about creating stuff

401
00:21:14,242 --> 00:21:19,063
that a doll can wear or managing your social status

402
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:20,943
in a group of kids, I mean, these

403
00:21:21,004 --> 00:21:23,224
are play patterns that nobody had looked at.

404
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:26,885
And I still don't see enough of that kind of experimentation

405
00:21:27,045 --> 00:21:27,645
across the hall.

406
00:21:27,665 --> 00:21:30,646
And by the way, we're the experimental game designers.

407
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,186
Absolutely.

408
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:38,649
We're also some of the first indies.

409
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,811
Yeah, first indies, that's true.

410
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:42,031
We had to publish ourselves.

411
00:21:43,332 --> 00:21:44,093
Even you were.

412
00:21:44,113 --> 00:21:48,715
Mattel Media, because Mattel was so worried about this, they were like, don't tell us.

413
00:21:50,753 --> 00:21:53,275
They created a small company, like a startup,

414
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:54,776
within this big company of Mattel.

415
00:21:54,796 --> 00:21:56,237
We were in a different building.

416
00:21:56,297 --> 00:21:57,878
Yeah, you guys were down the street.

417
00:21:57,918 --> 00:21:58,618
We were down the street.

418
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:01,100
We were like, so you're making TV commercials?

419
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,541
I'm like, no.

420
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:03,882
You're making games, like board games?

421
00:22:04,522 --> 00:22:04,723
No.

422
00:22:05,883 --> 00:22:07,725
And yet I couldn't explain it to them,

423
00:22:07,845 --> 00:22:10,707
and then Fashion Designer came out in the 96 Toy Fair.

424
00:22:10,907 --> 00:22:12,268
And they wouldn't have guessed either.

425
00:22:12,408 --> 00:22:13,849
They wouldn't, they had no idea.

426
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:16,551
And to this day, they probably still don't have any idea.

427
00:22:18,397 --> 00:22:20,078
But the weird thing was, so it's 95 and 2000,

428
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:23,140
and we were all so deep into it.

429
00:22:23,581 --> 00:22:24,581
And then I started looking back,

430
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:26,743
and I started doing the Barbie movies.

431
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:28,524
I became an independent producer,

432
00:22:29,045 --> 00:22:30,145
and then was working on the movies,

433
00:22:30,205 --> 00:22:31,907
and then I went and looked again at the games group,

434
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:33,868
and I don't know what happened to all the girls.

435
00:22:34,809 --> 00:22:36,590
It was like, we did this, and I thought,

436
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,892
oh, from now on, there's gonna be tons of games for girls.

437
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:40,753
It was gone by 2006.

438
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:46,543
There were no, I had went into THQ and pitched All Star

439
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:47,163
Cheer Squad.

440
00:22:47,723 --> 00:22:51,085
So my thing was also about the we and how I was

441
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:51,826
seeing girls on it.

442
00:22:51,866 --> 00:22:53,067
I'm like, time to do it again.

443
00:22:53,087 --> 00:22:54,207
Let's just do it again.

444
00:22:54,227 --> 00:22:57,889
And then we did it and then the financial crisis happened.

445
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,330
And again I was like, but that doesn't matter.

446
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,211
There'll still be girls.

447
00:23:01,051 --> 00:23:03,353
There's still not girls.

448
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:12,596
Well, I think though the boom occurred to your point where the existing system in place

449
00:23:12,716 --> 00:23:14,157
required TV advertising.

450
00:23:14,537 --> 00:23:21,019
The other piece was the boom in the toy industry for the female consumer, that in and of itself.

451
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:28,903
And the third piece was the platform, so that the CD-ROM was sort of this window where girls

452
00:23:28,983 --> 00:23:30,163
were already using this.

453
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:37,767
device and so now there was content for them on that device, whereas that platform isn't

454
00:23:38,007 --> 00:23:44,150
so much there and arguably I think our research would show that it's all mobile and that this

455
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:52,714
is a new huge opportunity for this consumer that I think we benchmarked.

456
00:23:53,054 --> 00:23:59,676
and now that can be built on from this new generation of gamers is it's all mobile.

457
00:23:59,696 --> 00:24:06,578
I'm going to be up here and say that Instagram is the entertainment space for this demographic,

458
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:11,780
and it plays out in all the play patterns that we identified very early on.

459
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:16,021
When you watch these girls on these different platforms now,

460
00:24:16,161 --> 00:24:17,862
that's what's happening for them.

461
00:24:18,462 --> 00:24:19,482
The opportunity, I think,

462
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:21,863
creatively is there to figure out.

463
00:24:22,323 --> 00:24:23,823
how can we leverage that?

464
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:25,684
Because I think that's a tremendous opportunity

465
00:24:25,704 --> 00:24:29,265
that this era of the 90s of gaming really identified.

466
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:33,406
And now mobile is there, and the audience penetration is there.

467
00:24:33,546 --> 00:24:36,807
And so now there is this new opportunity.

468
00:24:37,867 --> 00:24:41,348
We discovered in our research, historically speaking,

469
00:24:41,388 --> 00:24:46,429
that the console was a big problem in working with girls

470
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:50,330
as an audience, that probably 90% of the girls

471
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,810
that we interviewed and surveyed

472
00:24:52,712 --> 00:24:57,875
said that game consoles were for boys and personal computers were for anybody.

473
00:24:58,495 --> 00:25:05,059
So the CD-ROM was a way to unlock an un-gendered platform.

474
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:07,961
And that was a real opportunity for all of us, I think.

475
00:25:07,981 --> 00:25:08,421
That's true.

476
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:09,081
That was big.

477
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:11,803
But then Mattel decided we were going to be on a game console.

478
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:12,804
And it worked.

479
00:25:14,052 --> 00:25:14,653
It sort of worked.

480
00:25:15,414 --> 00:25:15,694
It did.

481
00:25:17,096 --> 00:25:19,079
One of the things I was asked to do in 97, 98

482
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,283
was to actually speak at Sony and to talk

483
00:25:22,303 --> 00:25:24,906
about the PlayStation and talk about doing some girls'

484
00:25:24,966 --> 00:25:25,447
projects.

485
00:25:25,487 --> 00:25:28,030
And I gave a speech about hair play and makeup play.

486
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,373
You can imagine how well that went over.

487
00:25:30,393 --> 00:25:33,417
And I was literally told, never come back here again.

488
00:25:35,002 --> 00:25:38,705
Never ever come back here again. We don't want to hear about hair play.

489
00:25:38,725 --> 00:25:40,826
And I'm like, it's going to look so awesome on this engine.

490
00:25:40,846 --> 00:25:44,148
And they're like, we don't need any of that. Please leave.

491
00:25:44,308 --> 00:25:51,713
Oh my God, Jessica. I consulted for Sony on girls the same year you did.

492
00:25:51,793 --> 00:25:52,253
So funny.

493
00:25:52,393 --> 00:25:57,096
And they were just like, you know, dicking around.

494
00:25:57,136 --> 00:25:59,297
And then we went to England. So we went the next day.

495
00:25:59,317 --> 00:26:00,738
It was like, well, where were we going to do it?

496
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:03,159
My general manager was like, I don't know, what do we do now?

497
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:04,460
I'm like, let's go to Europe.

498
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,761
Let's find somebody within this whole Sony thing that's

499
00:26:07,781 --> 00:26:08,621
going to understand.

500
00:26:08,681 --> 00:26:12,342
And so Sony Europe put out Barbie, is it Barbie Detective?

501
00:26:12,762 --> 00:26:13,382
Barbie Detective?

502
00:26:13,523 --> 00:26:15,623
The first, oh, Barbie Riding Club on the console.

503
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:16,303
Thank God you're here.

504
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,321
And it was a hit.

505
00:26:19,482 --> 00:26:21,844
I mean, and it was right for the time

506
00:26:21,884 --> 00:26:22,985
and right for the platform,

507
00:26:23,345 --> 00:26:25,267
because so many of the consoles

508
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:26,749
were also going through this change

509
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:28,710
where they were getting better and better upgrades.

510
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:30,032
And so those were starting to slide down

511
00:26:30,072 --> 00:26:31,253
to the girls in the family.

512
00:26:32,454 --> 00:26:33,495
We pitched to Sony.

513
00:26:34,556 --> 00:26:35,137
Everybody.

514
00:26:35,157 --> 00:26:36,778
We all get kicked out.

515
00:26:36,818 --> 00:26:37,279
That's awesome.

516
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:39,541
I sat across the table from them.

517
00:26:40,727 --> 00:26:43,689
He was on the phone closing a multi-million dollar licensing

518
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:45,350
deal with us sitting there in the office.

519
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:48,192
And then he put the phone down and he looked at me and he said,

520
00:26:48,652 --> 00:26:49,653
games for girls, huh?

521
00:26:49,993 --> 00:26:51,534
And I said, yes, sir, that's what we're doing.

522
00:26:51,574 --> 00:26:53,015
We started into the pitch.

523
00:26:53,035 --> 00:26:54,296
He says, what can you give me for $150,000?

524
00:26:54,376 --> 00:26:55,396
And I was like, not much.

525
00:26:55,436 --> 00:26:57,097
Punch in the nose, right? $150,000.

526
00:26:57,477 --> 00:26:59,779
Well, after funding four years of research to the tune

527
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:01,060
of about $8 million.

528
00:27:09,974 --> 00:27:14,778
Paul Allen of Interval Research came to see our first web demo.

529
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:18,340
And he sat there and he said, oh, that's cool.

530
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,542
Can you do that for boys?

531
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:25,085
And I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

532
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:31,450
Have you paid no attention at all?

533
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:32,951
It was very special.

534
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,049
There were a lot of those meetings.

535
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:42,273
And it's interesting, because now you would say, so I was at

536
00:27:42,313 --> 00:27:42,953
Disney in 2000.

537
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:46,756
When did Disney buy Lucas? 13, 14?

538
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:48,438
Anyway, I was there.

539
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:50,079
And I also worked as an imagineer.

540
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:53,642
Because there was a feeling at imagineering at Disney was

541
00:27:53,662 --> 00:27:55,403
that, well, girls don't like those type of rides.

542
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:56,524
And I'd sit in meetings.

543
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,985
I'm like, how can you say this?

544
00:27:58,025 --> 00:28:00,247
But my favorite meeting was Star Wars.

545
00:28:00,267 --> 00:28:01,228
They just bought Star Wars.

546
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:02,429
And they had all these people in the room.

547
00:28:02,449 --> 00:28:03,850
And they were talking about interactive

548
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,631
and talking about toys.

549
00:28:05,091 --> 00:28:06,692
And they said, well, you know, there can't be any girls

550
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:09,213
in any of the commercials or any of the planning.

551
00:28:09,693 --> 00:28:11,534
And my boss had brought me in and he's like,

552
00:28:11,574 --> 00:28:12,254
I could see him in the segment.

553
00:28:13,014 --> 00:28:13,214
Yeah.

554
00:28:14,035 --> 00:28:16,415
And I'm like, I'm getting madder and madder and madder.

555
00:28:16,856 --> 00:28:17,956
And finally the guy looks, he's like,

556
00:28:18,036 --> 00:28:19,197
I can tell you have something to say.

557
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:20,597
I'm like, what are you thinking?

558
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,618
What are you thinking?

559
00:28:22,678 --> 00:28:23,878
I would have had an aneurysm.

560
00:28:23,898 --> 00:28:25,939
But I was like, if you were sitting in here

561
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:28,160
and you told me that you couldn't make Star Wars

562
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,621
for black people, we would have this entire conversation

563
00:28:31,661 --> 00:28:33,162
and I'd be like on the phone with my lawyer.

564
00:28:33,822 --> 00:28:38,867
And, you know, you can say that and look at me in the face and think it's not a big deal.

565
00:28:38,907 --> 00:28:42,890
I mean, in some ways what we're talking about was a specific time, but anybody who tells

566
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:46,874
you now that this is only for girls or only for boys, it's bullshit.

567
00:28:47,554 --> 00:28:48,115
It just is.

568
00:28:48,475 --> 00:28:51,177
We can use all our curse words and they can't put it anywhere.

569
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:51,618
They'd bleep us out.

570
00:28:51,658 --> 00:28:52,138
It's just bullshit.

571
00:28:52,158 --> 00:28:52,839
Yeah, well, they're not.

572
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:54,500
I don't think they're even taping, so.

573
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,561
It's all good.

574
00:28:55,681 --> 00:28:56,682
It's a camera back there.

575
00:28:57,423 --> 00:28:58,023
I don't know about that.

576
00:28:58,043 --> 00:28:58,884
We're still under the radar.

577
00:28:58,904 --> 00:28:59,464
There's a camera right there.

578
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:00,105
There's a camera right there.

579
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:00,685
There's a camera right there.

580
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:01,306
There's a camera right there.

581
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:03,035
Fuck, there's a camera!

582
00:29:03,115 --> 00:29:05,656
Laughter

583
00:29:05,836 --> 00:29:07,237
Applause

584
00:29:07,257 --> 00:29:09,359
Brenda, you're awesome.

585
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,240
I'm so sorry.

586
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:17,104
It's still happening. Ray was not one of the dolls in the first set of action figures.

587
00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:19,466
Yes, but they weren't going to have...

588
00:29:19,546 --> 00:29:23,268
And the other thing was, because I'm a mom of a 12-year-old boy, and they said...

589
00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:24,389
Serves you right.

590
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:26,351
We don't want to have any moms involved either.

591
00:29:31,724 --> 00:29:32,425
Wait, what is that?

592
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:33,906
But that's also part of this.

593
00:29:34,046 --> 00:29:36,007
So this isn't just about gender-based.

594
00:29:36,027 --> 00:29:38,249
This is about understanding what girls want at different ages.

595
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:42,692
This is understanding about how girls create community, have created community, and are

596
00:29:42,732 --> 00:29:43,933
creating every single day.

597
00:29:44,473 --> 00:29:47,175
So now it's just such a different time period.

598
00:29:47,275 --> 00:29:50,498
But then there were all kinds of other things going on too.

599
00:29:50,518 --> 00:29:52,459
Well, I think there's still going on.

600
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:58,143
I mean, are there any women devs in the audience who haven't experienced a bunch of crap at

601
00:29:58,183 --> 00:29:58,323
work?

602
00:29:59,895 --> 00:30:00,897
Oh, good.

603
00:30:01,118 --> 00:30:02,681
Do you work in all-woman companies?

604
00:30:05,988 --> 00:30:07,932
And I would go into our developers and say, how many

605
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:08,874
women do you have working here?

606
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,512
And they would inevitably, they would say,

607
00:30:11,532 --> 00:30:12,873
our receptionist is a woman.

608
00:30:13,053 --> 00:30:14,994
Yeah, there's two over in marketing.

609
00:30:15,054 --> 00:30:16,515
Our marketing person.

610
00:30:16,696 --> 00:30:17,937
Our security guard.

611
00:30:17,957 --> 00:30:19,077
And I would say, your marketing person,

612
00:30:19,098 --> 00:30:20,979
I'm like, is your marketing CMO like the top?

613
00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:23,301
Oh no, that's our junior marketing person.

614
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:26,083
She's really cute.

615
00:30:26,503 --> 00:30:29,285
Well I'll tell you, our company was 80% female

616
00:30:29,326 --> 00:30:32,248
and if I could have bottled and sold all the drama

617
00:30:32,268 --> 00:30:35,190
that went on in that company between women,

618
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,391
I'd be rich now.

619
00:30:37,763 --> 00:30:38,725
That's actually a show.

620
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:39,886
Pitch at HBO.

621
00:30:39,986 --> 00:30:41,187
I could, yeah.

622
00:30:41,227 --> 00:30:41,848
That's actually...

623
00:30:41,928 --> 00:30:43,550
Silicon Valley X.

624
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:43,750
X.

625
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:44,611
Yeah.

626
00:30:46,834 --> 00:30:47,395
Well, um...

627
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:52,360
Ernest is like, oh my God.

628
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:52,661
You know.

629
00:30:53,121 --> 00:30:54,643
He knew what he was getting into.

630
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:02,023
Well, first I did want to mention, because Jessica's told me about it, that after she

631
00:31:02,043 --> 00:31:09,408
gave her talk here at GDC those years ago, she got a great deal of hate from, in fact,

632
00:31:09,529 --> 00:31:11,110
the vigorously feminist community.

633
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,612
She got a great deal of hate from all the men who said you shouldn't be making video

634
00:31:13,632 --> 00:31:14,212
games at all.

635
00:31:14,913 --> 00:31:16,053
She also got a great deal of hate.

636
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:20,957
Then you knew you were on the right track.

637
00:31:21,197 --> 00:31:22,678
Yeah, right.

638
00:31:22,698 --> 00:31:25,540
I'm sorry that happened to you.

639
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,460
It was really wild.

640
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,561
It's never happened to me.

641
00:31:27,581 --> 00:31:27,781
Or me.

642
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,225
But I wanted to look a little bit to the future,

643
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,707
because as we say, things have changed.

644
00:31:38,087 --> 00:31:42,730
That kind of 90s boom was temporary.

645
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,891
Boom in, shall we say, industry interest was temporary.

646
00:31:46,492 --> 00:31:49,573
But now, 48% of all gamers are female.

647
00:31:50,094 --> 00:31:52,155
And in fact, in the United Kingdom, it's over 50%.

648
00:31:53,535 --> 00:31:55,616
You know, which is pretty astonishing to those of us

649
00:31:55,656 --> 00:31:57,677
who grew up in an era when the stereotype was they

650
00:31:57,697 --> 00:31:58,778
were all 13-year-old boys.

651
00:31:59,298 --> 00:32:04,720
So and of course, much of this, as Laura has pointed out,

652
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,621
is driven by mobile.

653
00:32:05,921 --> 00:32:09,022
The question is now, is there still room for creating content

654
00:32:09,162 --> 00:32:10,143
just for girls?

655
00:32:10,623 --> 00:32:13,744
I mean, is there still a demand for girl games,

656
00:32:14,305 --> 00:32:16,806
even if it's necessarily on mobile or something like that?

657
00:32:16,866 --> 00:32:19,167
Or do we think that's kind of done,

658
00:32:19,227 --> 00:32:21,388
and it's all just going to be sort of gender neutral?

659
00:32:23,427 --> 00:32:24,528
You feeling neutral, baby?

660
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:25,189
No.

661
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:25,589
No.

662
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,871
Yeah.

663
00:32:27,151 --> 00:32:29,073
I also wanted to ask everybody out here, how many people,

664
00:32:29,153 --> 00:32:32,016
how many of you are in a company that 48% of the people

665
00:32:32,056 --> 00:32:33,097
you work with are women?

666
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:35,299
Excellent.

667
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:36,280
Oh, the same people.

668
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,341
That's excellent.

669
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:38,402
That's so good.

670
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:38,903
That's exciting.

671
00:32:39,143 --> 00:32:40,645
That means we keep doing our job.

672
00:32:40,685 --> 00:32:41,666
We keep doing our job.

673
00:32:41,706 --> 00:32:42,126
You what?

674
00:32:44,168 --> 00:32:44,749
You make what?

675
00:32:45,868 --> 00:32:46,648
Oh, Covet Fashion.

676
00:32:46,688 --> 00:32:47,668
Oh, yeah, that game.

677
00:32:47,788 --> 00:32:48,108
That's cool.

678
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:50,229
So I think that what we should be doing

679
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:53,670
is making games that women enjoy and that everyone can enjoy.

680
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,491
And finding those type of play patterns.

681
00:32:56,571 --> 00:32:58,251
Are there things specifically for girls?

682
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:01,552
I think there are play patterns that are definitely

683
00:33:01,932 --> 00:33:04,253
more for girls, but you find them on your mobile games.

684
00:33:04,453 --> 00:33:06,754
You find dressupgames.com.

685
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:08,194
Do you guys know that site?

686
00:33:08,894 --> 00:33:11,975
So when I did Digital Dollhouse.

687
00:33:12,495 --> 00:33:17,401
It was an online game and you could decorate a dollhouse in 3D, sort of 2.5D online.

688
00:33:18,001 --> 00:33:20,063
And we could not get traction.

689
00:33:20,464 --> 00:33:22,846
And every VC person we went to, they were like, crickets.

690
00:33:23,007 --> 00:33:24,328
Like, what? They want to do what?

691
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:27,331
And then we hooked up with dress-up games.

692
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:30,134
And they broke our server within 10 hours.

693
00:33:30,915 --> 00:33:34,699
It was just girls from all over the globe pouring in and wanting to do...

694
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:39,802
more of what they were getting little bites from in a dressupgames.com environment.

695
00:33:40,163 --> 00:33:43,145
And I think that we have a lot of that opportunity today, where you say,

696
00:33:43,185 --> 00:33:47,128
okay, this is a hit. It's also figuring out what makes a hit anymore.

697
00:33:47,148 --> 00:33:50,091
Because you used to have to sell a certain amount to make, you know, to say,

698
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:54,434
okay, this is worth it. And now you have a lot more smaller audiences who would pay.

699
00:33:54,935 --> 00:33:57,617
So there's, it's about economy as opposed to about gender.

700
00:33:58,298 --> 00:34:02,941
I would, I guess I would disagree in that I think there is space for

701
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:08,161
games that are aimed at a female identified audience.

702
00:34:09,843 --> 00:34:14,606
If you look at, you know, overlapping Gaussian distributions, right, we're talking curves

703
00:34:14,646 --> 00:34:21,472
here, we're not talking stereotypes, but there are differences in cognitive and social abilities

704
00:34:22,252 --> 00:34:28,738
that events, either because of genetics or culture or both, that predispose certain individuals

705
00:34:29,138 --> 00:34:32,881
to like certain kinds of play patterns better than others.

706
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:40,043
And we ought to be looking at, to me, the open opportunity space for people who are

707
00:34:40,123 --> 00:34:45,507
interested in serving girls, is to look at that sector.

708
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:52,873
those questions about social intelligence, about spatial navigation, about the things

709
00:34:52,913 --> 00:34:58,756
that might interest us in science or help us express ourselves in art, that there are

710
00:34:58,956 --> 00:35:03,698
different ways of understanding and being that are incredibly loaded with cultural stuff

711
00:35:04,198 --> 00:35:10,321
and that may also be, to a large extent, predetermined genetically if you look at what goes on with

712
00:35:10,381 --> 00:35:11,622
our friends the pygmy chimps.

713
00:35:12,182 --> 00:35:16,164
I advise you to review your primatology and you will see some differences.

714
00:35:17,344 --> 00:35:19,265
So it's not just us humans who have them.

715
00:35:19,925 --> 00:35:23,146
That's not to say that all females do this and all males do that,

716
00:35:23,447 --> 00:35:29,029
but there are opportunity spaces in developing abilities and confidence

717
00:35:29,569 --> 00:35:35,091
in females and female-identified people that are distinctive and deserve

718
00:35:35,131 --> 00:35:39,772
to be served and not watered down into some kind of neutral kumbaya crap.

719
00:35:40,173 --> 00:35:40,493
Thank you.

720
00:35:45,627 --> 00:35:50,251
Yeah, I mean, I appreciate the challenge of that question.

721
00:35:50,951 --> 00:35:59,799
Because I think what I do see is otherwise, porn and sports

722
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,621
hijack the whole market.

723
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:03,402
That's true.

724
00:36:03,442 --> 00:36:05,464
Because that drives the technology.

725
00:36:05,724 --> 00:36:06,585
And that's fine.

726
00:36:06,645 --> 00:36:07,425
I'll give them that.

727
00:36:07,746 --> 00:36:08,907
And then what?

728
00:36:09,207 --> 00:36:11,769
So I think the creative challenge comes.

729
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:16,831
Roblox, they just announced their numbers this past week.

730
00:36:16,911 --> 00:36:23,672
I mean, that is tremendously successful, huge female population, and I think what's compelling

731
00:36:23,732 --> 00:36:30,774
about that is within that environment, the user-generated entertainment.

732
00:36:30,954 --> 00:36:37,676
And so will we see girls developing within Roblox some environments that are

733
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:41,117
that are navigating in a different way.

734
00:36:41,877 --> 00:36:44,858
Just like with Minecraft, huge female consumer space.

735
00:36:45,278 --> 00:36:47,098
They play it way differently.

736
00:36:47,478 --> 00:36:49,939
So when you're in a girl's environment in Minecraft,

737
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,339
it's just a different experience.

738
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,080
And so, I don't know, maybe we'll see more

739
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,400
of that kind of a thing.

740
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:56,721
And again, Instagram.

741
00:36:57,221 --> 00:37:01,124
primarily female users and what can we do with that?

742
00:37:01,324 --> 00:37:03,486
And I do think that that is,

743
00:37:03,506 --> 00:37:04,907
I never thought about it that way,

744
00:37:04,947 --> 00:37:07,148
but I do think it's going to end up being

745
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,270
where there is a lot of places where

746
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:12,913
a boy's not gonna feel comfortable in a lot of those spaces

747
00:37:13,093 --> 00:37:14,834
and that's cool too.

748
00:37:15,074 --> 00:37:16,495
I mean, I think there's space for that.

749
00:37:17,056 --> 00:37:19,618
We've worked really hard to give Purple Moon cooties.

750
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:22,248
We would, if we were being honest.

751
00:37:22,328 --> 00:37:24,009
And now with AR, you can do that.

752
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:25,650
Yeah.

753
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,332
The idea was to make this obvious that, boys, this

754
00:37:29,392 --> 00:37:29,992
is not for you.

755
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:33,374
Because we knew that if a boy played a game

756
00:37:33,734 --> 00:37:36,436
and pronounced it lame, his little sister

757
00:37:36,476 --> 00:37:37,316
would never touch it.

758
00:37:38,196 --> 00:37:41,158
So we didn't want his hands on it to start with.

759
00:37:41,478 --> 00:37:43,419
And I think it was a pretty good strategy.

760
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:44,760
But I'm hearing what you're saying.

761
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,242
I think that's a wonderful opportunity to study, too,

762
00:37:48,282 --> 00:37:49,082
these worlds that.

763
00:37:49,587 --> 00:37:54,271
that differently gendered people make and to learn from that.

764
00:37:54,351 --> 00:37:56,052
Yeah, where will that gameplay go?

765
00:37:56,292 --> 00:37:57,914
I really like the concept that you're saying,

766
00:37:57,954 --> 00:38:00,976
talking about it is, this is gonna sound weird,

767
00:38:00,996 --> 00:38:02,477
but I almost wanna remove the gender label

768
00:38:02,517 --> 00:38:04,519
from it completely and just talk about play patterns.

769
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,162
We would never say, should we make a game

770
00:38:09,182 --> 00:38:10,583
for people who like golf or not?

771
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:12,174
That's a silly thing.

772
00:38:12,194 --> 00:38:14,599
We would talk about the play pattern.

773
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:19,067
Should we make games for people who like this particular type of play pattern?

774
00:38:20,169 --> 00:38:23,295
And the fact that we have some for ages, we've kind of.

775
00:38:24,733 --> 00:38:29,915
demonized and trivialized particular play patterns is silly to me. I mean, and that's

776
00:38:30,115 --> 00:38:33,275
part of why I started doing this all that time ago is, you know, we work in an incredibly

777
00:38:33,356 --> 00:38:37,476
smart industry and I thought this was a really stupid mistake they were making. There's a

778
00:38:37,657 --> 00:38:42,258
lot of money out there. And so I like the idea of backing us up and thinking about play

779
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:48,659
patterns and what play patterns are out there that we can use and explore and provide entertainment

780
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:50,380
to and find markets that like them.

781
00:38:51,312 --> 00:38:56,870
Remove the gender label from it completely and whoever likes that type of play pattern. There's something there for them

782
00:39:03,516 --> 00:39:08,580
It also requires us though to be open to finding out new things. So it's it's a

783
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,464
it's a dual kind of idea that you can learn about. You can come into it and say

784
00:39:13,764 --> 00:39:17,467
this is what we know girls like and then be completely closed off to new ideas.

785
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:21,010
When we were doing All-Star Cheer Squad I originally had pitched it and said

786
00:39:21,271 --> 00:39:24,153
it's cheerleading, there's social components, there's gonna be drama,

787
00:39:24,173 --> 00:39:29,598
there's gonna be clothes changes, cheerleading. And then I discovered, I know, and then I

788
00:39:29,638 --> 00:39:30,218
discovered...

789
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:32,556
that cheerleading is a sport.

790
00:39:33,036 --> 00:39:37,058
I didn't realize what a hardcore sport until I met,

791
00:39:37,298 --> 00:39:38,539
because it was all motion capture,

792
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:40,339
and so I met real cheerleaders.

793
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:41,560
And then they explained to me

794
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,000
what these championships look like,

795
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:45,422
and I saw Bring It On, and we had the same choreographer,

796
00:39:45,822 --> 00:39:47,062
and these people get hurt.

797
00:39:47,422 --> 00:39:49,263
They were like, we do this, and I said,

798
00:39:49,283 --> 00:39:50,664
we're animating it, you do not need

799
00:39:50,684 --> 00:39:51,844
to throw that person up in the air.

800
00:39:51,884 --> 00:39:53,565
We'll pull it apart, it'll look fine.

801
00:39:53,945 --> 00:39:55,286
They're like, no, no, that's not cheerleading.

802
00:39:55,686 --> 00:39:56,646
Cheerleading, you do those things.

803
00:39:56,666 --> 00:39:57,006
So I think,

804
00:39:57,476 --> 00:40:00,681
It's yes, we can make stuff that will appeal to girls, but

805
00:40:00,781 --> 00:40:02,764
everybody on both sides, girls in the audience have to be

806
00:40:02,804 --> 00:40:04,968
willing to find something new, and people who are creating

807
00:40:04,988 --> 00:40:07,171
the games need to be open to those ideas too.

808
00:40:07,371 --> 00:40:08,553
Yeah, that's right.

809
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,879
And San Francisco, great example that it is of

810
00:40:11,979 --> 00:40:12,299
everything.

811
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:17,906
The whole notion of binary gender is kind of an outworn idea.

812
00:40:18,226 --> 00:40:21,891
I mean, if you were going to try to express the 37 genders you see in this city,

813
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:26,316
you'd have a lot of tiny little games with tiny little audiences.

814
00:40:26,636 --> 00:40:28,999
There's a way in which it's kind of an outworn notion.

815
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:45,710
Some of you will probably remember that at the time I wrote a harshly critical article in Kamasutra

816
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:52,152
because in the 90s I felt like a number of the games for girls were being made as

817
00:40:52,772 --> 00:40:58,354
jump on the bandwagon, quick, cheap, you know, not knockoffs exactly, but quick, cheap titles

818
00:40:58,774 --> 00:41:04,116
that were, you know, offered like four or five hours of gameplay, but they still cost 40 or 50 bucks.

819
00:41:05,857 --> 00:41:13,928
And I felt like an awful lot of this was simply a quick marketing phenomenon rather than something real.

820
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:15,831
I'm not accusing anyone here.

821
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:17,513
You better not be.

822
00:41:17,633 --> 00:41:17,813
Yeah.

823
00:41:19,114 --> 00:41:21,735
Well, I knew about your $8 million worth of research.

824
00:41:22,156 --> 00:41:23,176
So yes, yes.

825
00:41:24,097 --> 00:41:27,479
But when Sherry asked me to moderate this panel,

826
00:41:27,499 --> 00:41:29,660
I wasn't entirely sure of the welcome I was going to get.

827
00:41:31,081 --> 00:41:35,024
But that does sort of lead to an interesting question.

828
00:41:35,564 --> 00:41:37,085
A certain amount of it, you must admit,

829
00:41:37,265 --> 00:41:39,607
was just marketing fluff and people

830
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:41,188
grabbing for some pink dollars.

831
00:41:42,329 --> 00:41:44,770
So what do you think was actually

832
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:48,053
kind of accomplished at the time in real terms?

833
00:41:49,195 --> 00:41:52,259
I mean, what did you do that really broke open the doors?

834
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:55,363
So all the girls here who have played any of our games, would you raise your hands?

835
00:41:56,624 --> 00:41:57,365
That's what we did.

836
00:42:04,842 --> 00:42:10,805
I tell you, at least once a week, if not more often, I get email or a letter from somebody

837
00:42:10,825 --> 00:42:15,627
who played Purple Moon Games, who says to me, you changed my life, I can't thank you

838
00:42:15,687 --> 00:42:15,927
enough.

839
00:42:16,588 --> 00:42:20,690
I'm studying design now, or whatever, I just had a wonderful meeting with a young woman

840
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:26,633
who's going to become a terrific game dev as a result of, I think, of having had that

841
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:27,913
space and that example.

842
00:42:27,973 --> 00:42:29,334
So for me, that's...

843
00:42:29,854 --> 00:42:30,854
That's what happened.

844
00:42:31,455 --> 00:42:32,175
That's what happened.

845
00:42:32,435 --> 00:42:35,317
And when I get those letters from girls now in their 20s or

846
00:42:35,898 --> 00:42:38,820
whatever, I send them a copy of Utopian Entrepreneur, which

847
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,383
really explains how the sausage was made, so that they can

848
00:42:42,423 --> 00:42:44,764
understand what it actually meant to be

849
00:42:44,844 --> 00:42:46,265
doing what we all did.

850
00:42:46,285 --> 00:42:49,107
That's what happened.

851
00:42:49,528 --> 00:42:51,569
I think there was a lot of empowerment that

852
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,251
persists to this day.

853
00:42:53,291 --> 00:42:56,153
There's a Facebook group called I Miss Purple Moon.

854
00:42:57,717 --> 00:43:02,641
We mattered to people, and you mattered to people, and we all did.

855
00:43:03,362 --> 00:43:09,887
And we changed some lives, and some of those lives that got changed are moving forward in culture-making today.

856
00:43:09,907 --> 00:43:13,690
And I think that's really important. That's the thing I'm proudest of.

857
00:43:14,744 --> 00:43:18,386
to the pink game idea. I remember being really excited when there were other knockoffs and

858
00:43:18,406 --> 00:43:20,988
things. It didn't bother me because we had Barbie.

859
00:43:22,128 --> 00:43:22,809
Right.

860
00:43:23,189 --> 00:43:27,351
So there was not going to be a competition that way. But I remember a dad sent me a picture

861
00:43:27,431 --> 00:43:32,774
when I was at Mattel Media of his daughter and both of his daughters. One was like maybe

862
00:43:32,894 --> 00:43:34,575
four and the other one was seven.

863
00:43:35,095 --> 00:43:37,857
And he had carved them a chair to sit in front of the computer

864
00:43:37,937 --> 00:43:42,620
because he said that they kept bringing their chairs closer together to play at the same time.

865
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,782
And at the time I was having this whole conversation about social connection

866
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:49,323
and how multiplayer, how that was making sense,

867
00:43:49,383 --> 00:43:52,865
and I was pushing to get more and more budget so we could at least experiment.

868
00:43:53,485 --> 00:43:57,307
And they were saying, I don't know, are girls going to play with other girls?

869
00:43:57,587 --> 00:44:01,528
I was like, really? Really? Really?

870
00:44:02,048 --> 00:44:05,210
And I said, look at how people play with the dolls.

871
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:07,410
Again, no difference. Seamless.

872
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,171
So I was excited that these girls were playing together

873
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:12,252
and that they had other things to choose from.

874
00:44:12,332 --> 00:44:14,433
It felt like, they can't play Barbie fashion designer.

875
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:15,253
All the time.

876
00:44:15,433 --> 00:44:18,075
Well, and people, I was telling you guys this earlier,

877
00:44:18,096 --> 00:44:21,098
the reporters, when the four of us were kind of all there

878
00:44:21,378 --> 00:44:22,919
up at the forefront, I mean, reporters,

879
00:44:22,979 --> 00:44:24,180
where they were just all over this,

880
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:26,642
they would come to me and they would ask me questions,

881
00:44:26,682 --> 00:44:28,424
and what they really wanted me to do

882
00:44:28,484 --> 00:44:30,285
was dig dirt on the other developers.

883
00:44:30,325 --> 00:44:31,786
And I was like, are you crazy?

884
00:44:32,207 --> 00:44:34,028
We have to succeed, all of us.

885
00:44:34,929 --> 00:44:37,671
We must all succeed because we owe it to our girls

886
00:44:37,691 --> 00:44:38,872
and we owe it to our audiences.

887
00:44:38,952 --> 00:44:39,973
We must be there.

888
00:44:40,634 --> 00:44:45,979
We must have, and if any of us fail, my heart will be broken because we must all succeed.

889
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:47,961
And they'd always not print that.

890
00:44:47,981 --> 00:44:49,082
Thank you.

891
00:44:49,122 --> 00:44:49,562
Thank you.

892
00:44:50,964 --> 00:44:51,664
Thank you.

893
00:44:51,905 --> 00:44:54,507
Very beautiful.

894
00:44:58,471 --> 00:44:59,632
Ernest Udnati Mann.

895
00:45:02,690 --> 00:45:08,535
Yeah, I've been nervous about meeting you again because we haven't spoken for like the last 18 years

896
00:45:09,096 --> 00:45:12,159
Ernest and I were both in the founding group of this conference

897
00:45:21,202 --> 00:45:24,245
Well, since it was a big topic last year,

898
00:45:24,466 --> 00:45:27,829
and it is still somewhat of a big topic,

899
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:33,755
there's still an aspect of it here this year, VR and AR.

900
00:45:35,978 --> 00:45:37,780
This is not particularly gendered,

901
00:45:38,281 --> 00:45:40,183
but it's potentially interesting.

902
00:45:41,404 --> 00:45:43,626
Are girls going to accept it?

903
00:45:44,387 --> 00:45:45,748
Or is this a guy thing?

904
00:45:45,768 --> 00:45:48,231
How does it make people feel?

905
00:45:48,251 --> 00:45:51,914
Does anybody want to comment on VR and AR in the,

906
00:45:53,716 --> 00:45:55,658
that collection of play patterns which

907
00:45:55,718 --> 00:45:58,481
has been traditionally associated with X chromosomes?

908
00:46:00,005 --> 00:46:04,906
Well, I do see a whole lot of female VR XR devs out there,

909
00:46:04,946 --> 00:46:06,226
and I think that's terrific.

910
00:46:07,887 --> 00:46:10,847
Many more XR devs than game devs, as far as I can tell,

911
00:46:10,907 --> 00:46:11,307
are women.

912
00:46:11,487 --> 00:46:12,448
I don't know if that's true.

913
00:46:12,488 --> 00:46:14,268
That's a cursory look.

914
00:46:15,388 --> 00:46:17,689
I'm on the board of the Virtual World Society,

915
00:46:17,889 --> 00:46:22,089
and both the gender balance on the board

916
00:46:22,149 --> 00:46:25,250
and the gender balance among the devs is pretty even-steven.

917
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:29,591
There's tremendous opportunity, but it's not.

918
00:46:30,734 --> 00:46:33,995
If you're really doing VR, if you're really doing VR,

919
00:46:34,596 --> 00:46:37,457
you're not looking at play patterns so much as you are

920
00:46:37,518 --> 00:46:42,080
looking at environments that are productive of play, which

921
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,482
is different in a subtle way.

922
00:46:45,182 --> 00:46:47,884
So I think we're all trying to find our way around that.

923
00:46:47,904 --> 00:46:50,885
And I think female devs maybe have an advantage,

924
00:46:50,945 --> 00:46:54,808
because our play has always, traditionally,

925
00:46:55,008 --> 00:46:55,908
overlapping Gaussian.

926
00:46:56,623 --> 00:47:01,027
Narrative play is the constructive play of females.

927
00:47:01,727 --> 00:47:05,490
So creating narrative out of environments and situations is

928
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:06,611
something that we do well.

929
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,414
And creating the environments and situations out of which

930
00:47:09,694 --> 00:47:11,615
play can be made is something that we do well.

931
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:14,017
So I feel there's great potential both from the

932
00:47:14,057 --> 00:47:18,301
development side and the customer side for these two

933
00:47:18,341 --> 00:47:19,302
technologies.

934
00:47:19,522 --> 00:47:20,543
Yeah, I 100% agree.

935
00:47:20,743 --> 00:47:22,244
I think it's a great opportunity.

936
00:47:24,326 --> 00:47:25,647
I don't think there's going to be money in the air.

937
00:47:26,739 --> 00:47:27,420
I don't care.

938
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,704
It's fine.

939
00:47:29,724 --> 00:47:31,407
That's fine.

940
00:47:31,668 --> 00:47:33,772
And I say that both to be provocative,

941
00:47:33,832 --> 00:47:36,557
but also VR is a very old technology.

942
00:47:36,978 --> 00:47:38,020
We've been doing it for a long time.

943
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:42,485
And I think that there are new markets and new ways

944
00:47:42,545 --> 00:47:43,325
to be paying for it.

945
00:47:43,365 --> 00:47:45,867
I tend to be, I'm Capricorn, I'm very money oriented.

946
00:47:46,287 --> 00:47:46,867
It's terrible.

947
00:47:47,007 --> 00:47:49,048
But it's something that when people are thinking about

948
00:47:49,068 --> 00:47:51,470
starting their own companies and what kinds of things they

949
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,331
want to be doing, I think it's really important to

950
00:47:53,391 --> 00:47:55,472
understand how are you going to monetize?

951
00:47:56,052 --> 00:47:58,273
And so I think VR has opportunities.

952
00:47:58,494 --> 00:48:00,575
I personally am much more excited about augmented

953
00:48:00,615 --> 00:48:04,737
reality, because I think contextually the idea of

954
00:48:04,777 --> 00:48:06,078
making productive environments.

955
00:48:06,598 --> 00:48:09,499
and finding play, but I always kind of break it down.

956
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,040
How curious is the child?

957
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:13,862
How curious is the person working on the experience?

958
00:48:13,882 --> 00:48:15,222
Before gender, before anything,

959
00:48:16,063 --> 00:48:17,263
what are they going to try to do?

960
00:48:17,784 --> 00:48:19,224
And I do think that there are different steps

961
00:48:19,244 --> 00:48:21,406
that men and women take, but that's it.

962
00:48:21,486 --> 00:48:23,326
I don't have to give any other part of it

963
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:24,447
that's being gender-based.

964
00:48:24,947 --> 00:48:26,788
I think one of the reasons why we've been starting

965
00:48:26,808 --> 00:48:29,290
to refer to this whole field as XR is because

966
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:36,855
We see AR and VR are not that different.

967
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:42,859
All you have to do is like opaque the screen for VR and translucent it for, you know, it's not a huge deal.

968
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:48,103
And there are a bunch of things in between like modeling and simulation that can be blended together

969
00:48:48,623 --> 00:48:56,329
into augmented experiences of the natural world, of the social world, of the microscopic world, you know.

970
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,894
opportunities abound but putting ourselves in any of these little boxes

971
00:49:00,974 --> 00:49:02,156
is going to be premature

972
00:49:02,496 --> 00:49:06,302
because I think the medium will turn into something that we used to mean when

973
00:49:06,322 --> 00:49:07,844
we said mixed reality

974
00:49:08,344 --> 00:49:13,191
and XR is a way to say it's not mixed, it's a different fabric and it has all

975
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:13,331
these

976
00:49:13,771 --> 00:49:17,554
capacities, you know, like electronics and textiles, right?

977
00:49:17,574 --> 00:49:22,878
Well, but bluntly, it's going to be a moot point completely if we don't get the publishing

978
00:49:22,998 --> 00:49:24,659
developers to fund the women developers.

979
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:25,200
That's true.

980
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:30,964
Because we're still something like one woman for every seven men that are funded, and so

981
00:49:30,984 --> 00:49:34,387
the women that are out there, there are a lot of women out there doing the XR work and

982
00:49:34,407 --> 00:49:35,568
they're not getting funding.

983
00:49:36,268 --> 00:49:36,849
That is very true.

984
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:37,069
True.

985
00:49:37,689 --> 00:49:38,610
Especially if they're over 26.

986
00:49:41,235 --> 00:49:42,056
It's a whole different panel.

987
00:49:43,497 --> 00:49:43,878
I'm 27, so.

988
00:49:44,058 --> 00:49:46,720
Me too.

989
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,844
Is that hex or dog ears?

990
00:49:50,884 --> 00:49:57,310
What do you think about augmented reality?

991
00:49:57,791 --> 00:49:59,052
Laura's like, yeah.

992
00:49:59,132 --> 00:50:01,534
No, I thought, I mean, I just referred to it as an umbrella.

993
00:50:01,554 --> 00:50:01,634
Look.

994
00:50:02,576 --> 00:50:06,379
How many technologies have we all lived through where, I mean, they are in the garage?

995
00:50:06,439 --> 00:50:10,322
So this is all just, I agree, at some point money can't matter.

996
00:50:10,342 --> 00:50:15,346
And it's so devalued now because what is BlackRock has I don't know how many trillion under management.

997
00:50:15,406 --> 00:50:18,809
So I mean it's there, but you got to try and go get it.

998
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:22,652
But there's a lot of money out there and it needs to be dedicated to figuring this out.

999
00:50:22,692 --> 00:50:26,996
I mean you're going to keep going to these events where it doesn't work when it's supposed

1000
00:50:27,056 --> 00:50:28,237
to and you're standing and.

1001
00:50:28,717 --> 00:50:31,799
And then they'd sit on and we're like, what the hell am I doing with this?

1002
00:50:31,819 --> 00:50:33,020
There's no interactive play.

1003
00:50:33,461 --> 00:50:38,124
But you've got to get, you know, these are baby steps until you can get to where you're

1004
00:50:38,144 --> 00:50:39,084
going to hit the mother load.

1005
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:44,228
And there do have to be women in that environment and in that creative brainstorming session

1006
00:50:44,348 --> 00:50:45,749
to see where that unfolds.

1007
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,471
And there's such terrific research opportunities.

1008
00:50:49,551 --> 00:50:53,914
I mean, there's a vector for research funding in the XR world.

1009
00:50:53,994 --> 00:50:57,176
Just how do you make a smooth transition from AR to VR?

1010
00:50:58,524 --> 00:50:59,725
you should be able to do that.

1011
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:02,146
What does that look like?

1012
00:51:02,427 --> 00:51:04,408
That's a really damn good research question.

1013
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:05,909
I bet DARPA would pay for it.

1014
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:10,752
So there are other avenues for funding work

1015
00:51:10,932 --> 00:51:12,934
if there's honest to God research in it

1016
00:51:12,994 --> 00:51:15,875
that we might all be doing a better job of grabbing.

1017
00:51:16,016 --> 00:51:19,658
Well, having done, I don't know, 17 different varieties

1018
00:51:19,718 --> 00:51:22,580
of fashion closets with various technologies,

1019
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,602
I guarantee the fashion closet will be one of the home runs.

1020
00:51:26,442 --> 00:51:30,164
in some form of reality beyond what we are living in right now.

1021
00:51:30,584 --> 00:51:34,166
Whatever that technology is, it will be driven by fashion.

1022
00:51:35,106 --> 00:51:35,766
I would buy it.

1023
00:51:36,547 --> 00:51:37,227
Exactly.

1024
00:51:37,247 --> 00:51:39,948
I think I'd dress. Absolutely.

1025
00:51:40,468 --> 00:51:41,929
We're getting a vibe.

1026
00:51:42,009 --> 00:51:44,410
My son got it for his birthday and putting it up in the room.

1027
00:51:44,430 --> 00:51:47,231
The only thing I want to play is Tilt Brush because I want to stand in the middle and dress.

1028
00:51:47,671 --> 00:51:49,972
I create the princess dress and my son's looking at me like...

1029
00:51:50,332 --> 00:51:51,835
You would have won.

1030
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,057
Honey, this is your mom's thing.

1031
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:54,900
Oh, you're playing with it?

1032
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:55,521
Like, yeah.

1033
00:51:55,721 --> 00:51:56,182
What do you think?

1034
00:51:56,763 --> 00:51:59,067
But it is, it's going to be great.

1035
00:52:00,229 --> 00:52:01,711
It already is in a lot of ways.

1036
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,073
Very exciting.

1037
00:52:04,848 --> 00:52:10,589
I consulted briefly for an AR company based in Australia.

1038
00:52:10,909 --> 00:52:14,270
And they had a device with goggles and everything, and

1039
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:16,530
they put the computer in the backpack.

1040
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:19,070
And you were supposed to run around in a park playing this

1041
00:52:19,131 --> 00:52:21,131
game, and aliens would attack you and so forth.

1042
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,851
But it was AR.

1043
00:52:23,871 --> 00:52:27,172
And of course, part of the screen was obscured by things

1044
00:52:27,192 --> 00:52:27,912
that were going on.

1045
00:52:28,492 --> 00:52:30,633
And I said, have you considered the liability

1046
00:52:30,673 --> 00:52:30,853
issue?

1047
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:35,302
Are you aware that if you're hiding that, then what happens if a person steps into a

1048
00:52:35,342 --> 00:52:39,906
manhole or stomps a little kid that they can't see because it's covered by an alien?

1049
00:52:40,727 --> 00:52:44,350
And oh no, they'd never consider that because they're Australians and they don't live in

1050
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:45,491
a litigious society.

1051
00:52:46,032 --> 00:52:48,914
So I never heard from them again.

1052
00:52:48,934 --> 00:52:50,636
Should we do Q&A?

1053
00:52:51,537 --> 00:52:52,578
Yes, yes.

1054
00:52:52,678 --> 00:52:53,679
I think it's time.

1055
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:54,039
Yes.

1056
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:58,523
So yes, well, thank you all very much for those insights and histories.

1057
00:53:06,397 --> 00:53:08,279
And by all means, let's take questions.

1058
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:09,440
We'll start over here.

1059
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:10,742
Hello.

1060
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:13,164
Thank you all for being here so much.

1061
00:53:13,204 --> 00:53:15,686
It's incredible to hear you talk about your experiences.

1062
00:53:17,188 --> 00:53:19,930
So I and maybe a couple other people here

1063
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:22,833
grew up in the 90s inspired by the stuff that you all made.

1064
00:53:22,853 --> 00:53:24,855
And I was just wondering, when you were growing up,

1065
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,116
what inspired you?

1066
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:27,792
Barbie.

1067
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:29,653
Oh, how nice.

1068
00:53:29,693 --> 00:53:30,053
Barbie.

1069
00:53:30,193 --> 00:53:31,394
I would say Barbie.

1070
00:53:32,434 --> 00:53:36,216
People don't understand necessarily that Barbie, especially when I was growing up, is sort

1071
00:53:36,236 --> 00:53:36,796
of a boat.

1072
00:53:36,836 --> 00:53:39,818
Like you could put the aspirations that I had this dream.

1073
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:41,538
I grew up in a small town in Oregon.

1074
00:53:42,259 --> 00:53:47,240
and going to New York and fashion and all these different things and she was my avatar.

1075
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,681
She got dressed up and she went and every couple of seconds she was doing something else and I was

1076
00:53:51,701 --> 00:53:57,202
like that's what I want. So she was that part was very inspiring for me. I was inspired by Girl Scouts.

1077
00:53:58,582 --> 00:54:03,523
I really was. And I still have trouble resisting a woman in a uniform.

1078
00:54:03,543 --> 00:54:03,943
So do I.

1079
00:54:12,182 --> 00:54:14,885
I was inspired by my dad.

1080
00:54:16,005 --> 00:54:19,508
I was told that we were the first generation that could grow up and be our dads.

1081
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:27,635
And so I just, you know, that was what is building a business and defining and sort

1082
00:54:27,675 --> 00:54:28,976
of obliterating the boundary.

1083
00:54:30,657 --> 00:54:31,458
Dungeons and Dragons.

1084
00:54:31,938 --> 00:54:32,279
Yeah.

1085
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:32,659
I agree.

1086
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:32,919
I agree.

1087
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:33,360
I agree.

1088
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:33,800
I agree.

1089
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:34,020
I agree.

1090
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:34,220
I agree.

1091
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:34,540
I agree.

1092
00:54:34,701 --> 00:54:35,101
I agree.

1093
00:54:35,121 --> 00:54:35,801
I agree.

1094
00:54:36,477 --> 00:54:45,788
I got lost in fantasy worlds and Dungeons and Dragons and I could not understand why more girls weren't doing this because it was the most wonderful escape storytelling I'd ever been involved in.

1095
00:54:45,928 --> 00:54:46,649
Nice.

1096
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:47,770
Thank you.

1097
00:54:48,897 --> 00:54:50,298
Okay, let's go over to the other side.

1098
00:54:50,558 --> 00:54:52,079
I think everyone's going to thank you for the panel.

1099
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:52,860
This was awesome.

1100
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:57,703
I just want to go back, I guess piggybacking off of all of your answers there, about the

1101
00:54:57,743 --> 00:55:02,026
kind of mechanics, you know, the act of play that went into these games.

1102
00:55:02,406 --> 00:55:05,668
How much of that would you say was borrowed from things you'd seen before?

1103
00:55:05,728 --> 00:55:07,249
How much were you inventing outright?

1104
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:12,553
And just that sort of sense of building these worlds of games at that time, like that just

1105
00:55:12,613 --> 00:55:14,454
historical question is really fascinating to me.

1106
00:55:14,474 --> 00:55:14,915
Thank you so much.

1107
00:55:15,331 --> 00:55:16,372
I have a quick answer.

1108
00:55:17,193 --> 00:55:20,577
The Secret Paths games were about the inner lives of girls.

1109
00:55:21,298 --> 00:55:24,362
And if I had built, if I had designed those games

1110
00:55:24,502 --> 00:55:26,244
on the basis of what I thought I knew

1111
00:55:26,264 --> 00:55:29,467
about the inner secret lives of girls,

1112
00:55:29,888 --> 00:55:31,550
I would have done, you know, Secret Garden.

1113
00:55:32,151 --> 00:55:33,933
But when we went out and interviewed girls.

1114
00:55:34,993 --> 00:55:37,615
They didn't want to take care of no stinking animals.

1115
00:55:38,055 --> 00:55:40,316
They wanted the animals to take care of them.

1116
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:42,377
And they wanted magic stories.

1117
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:44,799
And it was, you know, I would have been so wrong

1118
00:55:45,379 --> 00:55:47,640
if I hadn't listened, you know,

1119
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,861
if I had based everything on my own childhood.

1120
00:55:50,261 --> 00:55:51,742
So, just a tidbit.

1121
00:55:52,462 --> 00:55:54,063
I had to play out everything with a doll.

1122
00:55:54,223 --> 00:55:59,724
I would actually take all the Barbie dolls and I'd sit under my desk, and then I would

1123
00:55:59,764 --> 00:56:03,725
doinky doink play it out and think, okay, again, I'm playing Barbie until I was 16.

1124
00:56:04,085 --> 00:56:05,866
And I was like, now, what would I do next?

1125
00:56:06,006 --> 00:56:08,187
Oh, this, and then that would be the next level of the game.

1126
00:56:08,527 --> 00:56:09,607
And this is what we would do.

1127
00:56:09,667 --> 00:56:13,668
And, you know, Barbie fashion designer, we had fabric that printed through the printer

1128
00:56:13,688 --> 00:56:14,368
and you cut it out.

1129
00:56:14,768 --> 00:56:18,769
We actually went through and made sure that the designs were right for girls and that

1130
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:21,630
it really was about the play pattern and not just what I wanted.

1131
00:56:22,651 --> 00:56:23,191
That was the key.

1132
00:56:23,211 --> 00:56:23,471
Go ahead.

1133
00:56:23,491 --> 00:56:27,653
I was going to say, we worked, like I said, we worked with 3,000 high school, junior high

1134
00:56:27,693 --> 00:56:32,355
school, and high school age girls to develop it, and we just kind of followed what they

1135
00:56:32,495 --> 00:56:34,236
asked for and what they wanted to do.

1136
00:56:35,116 --> 00:56:35,996
Was there anything out there?

1137
00:56:36,277 --> 00:56:41,139
I would say maybe kind of like choose your own adventure, text adventure, story building

1138
00:56:41,219 --> 00:56:46,201
stuff would kind of be where we were thinking, but we just did what the girls asked us for.

1139
00:56:46,381 --> 00:56:47,101
It's also really important.

1140
00:56:47,121 --> 00:56:48,662
Mattel is a huge research facility.

1141
00:56:48,682 --> 00:56:50,703
I mean, they do tons and tons of testing.

1142
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:53,985
So a lot of that also came from an enormous amount of

1143
00:56:54,165 --> 00:56:55,626
information that was coming really fast.

1144
00:56:56,806 --> 00:56:59,388
But I think that's actually an incredibly insightful

1145
00:56:59,428 --> 00:57:05,171
question, because we didn't grow up knowing certain

1146
00:57:05,311 --> 00:57:10,093
engines and informing, oh, well, if I'm a Doom player,

1147
00:57:10,534 --> 00:57:14,416
and then that'll inform how I'm going to develop a game.

1148
00:57:14,496 --> 00:57:14,796
And so

1149
00:57:15,296 --> 00:57:17,177
I found it to be very difficult.

1150
00:57:17,457 --> 00:57:21,959
I chose Austin because I'm from Texas and that's where all the gamers were, but I had

1151
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:27,161
no idea how to explain to my programmers what I wanted them to do because they were coming

1152
00:57:27,241 --> 00:57:32,183
from a lot of gameplay and I was coming from, like, can you make it do this?

1153
00:57:32,543 --> 00:57:36,804
And I needed to, and they, you know, so that took a lot in that development process to

1154
00:57:36,864 --> 00:57:40,386
get them to understand and for me to understand what the capacity was.

1155
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:44,910
Over here.

1156
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:45,291
OK.

1157
00:57:45,351 --> 00:57:46,191
Thank you for the panel.

1158
00:57:48,292 --> 00:57:50,874
I'm not an expert in this, so you can correct me

1159
00:57:50,894 --> 00:57:51,774
if I get something wrong.

1160
00:57:51,874 --> 00:57:59,378
But lately, I've seen this kind of slightly new market

1161
00:57:59,418 --> 00:58:02,640
for games that seem to be directed at moms rather than

1162
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:03,020
girls.

1163
00:58:04,461 --> 00:58:08,804
I've seen games that are solitaire games set around

1164
00:58:08,904 --> 00:58:12,466
a romance story in Regency, England, which is an excellent

1165
00:58:12,486 --> 00:58:12,966
game, by the way.

1166
00:58:13,378 --> 00:58:17,221
and other stories which are about sexy vampires solving jigsaw puzzles.

1167
00:58:19,463 --> 00:58:27,349
I'm curious, how much do you think these games came out of the work you and others did in

1168
00:58:27,389 --> 00:58:34,094
the 90s and what do you think of them as kind of representing at least part of the future

1169
00:58:34,314 --> 00:58:36,536
from what you've worked on prior?

1170
00:58:36,836 --> 00:58:37,056
Thank you.

1171
00:58:39,822 --> 00:58:45,465
I'm amazed it took so long for the romance genre to be realized and interactive, because

1172
00:58:45,525 --> 00:58:49,507
it is such a huge category in books.

1173
00:58:50,087 --> 00:58:54,850
I don't think they took much from us, I think maybe just the idea that there's a vacant

1174
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:55,870
lot here.

1175
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:59,992
Why don't we go see if this works, because there are obviously customers for this type

1176
00:59:00,032 --> 00:59:00,592
of narrative.

1177
00:59:01,133 --> 00:59:04,094
I'm pleased to see we're seeing them, and we're seeing to be, there seems to be.

1178
00:59:04,898 --> 00:59:07,541
this increase in them and I'm pleased to see it.

1179
00:59:07,581 --> 00:59:09,843
Again, it's a new play pattern, different play pattern.

1180
00:59:10,704 --> 00:59:11,404
I like seeing it.

1181
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,707
I think it's also about how much time you have.

1182
00:59:15,047 --> 00:59:16,829
So a mom wants to get in and have a game

1183
00:59:17,129 --> 00:59:19,211
and her game will be five minutes, 10 minutes,

1184
00:59:19,251 --> 00:59:22,374
snackable, small, while the daughter might be on a mobile

1185
00:59:22,754 --> 00:59:26,558
for hours in kind of getting all of her world

1186
00:59:26,618 --> 00:59:27,338
into one place.

1187
00:59:27,739 --> 00:59:29,220
So I think that that's about appealing

1188
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:30,241
to just different age groups.

1189
00:59:31,365 --> 00:59:34,789
And boomer women are really into puzzle games, as you know.

1190
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:38,833
Yeah, Monument Valley is number one in women over 50.

1191
00:59:38,953 --> 00:59:39,754
Yeah.

1192
00:59:39,814 --> 00:59:46,261
So, it's number one with a lot of groups, but, you know, it's incredibly popular.

1193
00:59:46,301 --> 00:59:49,805
And then the older you get with women, the more they like the ones that are based on

1194
00:59:49,865 --> 00:59:51,767
board games that they knew when they were kids.

1195
00:59:52,107 --> 00:59:56,329
Maybe I would hope that the people making them played our games

1196
00:59:57,270 --> 01:00:00,911
and started there with the idea that now we can do games that are games we like.

1197
01:00:03,512 --> 01:00:06,694
I would like to know if you can all be available for the wrap-up room.

1198
01:00:07,014 --> 01:00:07,854
Sure.

1199
01:00:07,934 --> 01:00:09,295
I don't know where it is from here.

1200
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:11,316
Let's do it outside.

1201
01:00:11,336 --> 01:00:14,317
They're usually down at the end.

1202
01:00:14,517 --> 01:00:15,438
Well, we're at the end, right?

1203
01:00:15,458 --> 01:00:17,919
They're usually down at the end here or I think they're around...

1204
01:00:19,202 --> 01:00:20,063
the other hallway.

1205
01:00:20,223 --> 01:00:21,103
Well, follow the hat.

1206
01:00:21,864 --> 01:00:22,904
They're around the other hallway.

1207
01:00:23,044 --> 01:00:24,545
And they will ask us not to speak.

1208
01:00:24,585 --> 01:00:28,187
Yeah, I'm very sorry for those of you who've been waiting to ask a question, but we have

1209
01:00:28,227 --> 01:00:29,308
in fact run out of time.

1210
01:00:29,688 --> 01:00:31,489
So I want to thank you all very much for coming.

1211
01:00:31,509 --> 01:00:31,689
Thank you.

1212
01:00:31,709 --> 01:00:32,029
Thank you.

1213
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:33,390
And I want to give a huge round of applause.
