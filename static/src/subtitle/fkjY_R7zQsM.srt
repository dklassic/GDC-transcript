1
00:00:04,527 --> 00:00:05,207
My name is Jonas.

2
00:00:05,507 --> 00:00:09,150
Before I start, I have a QR code on the slides.

3
00:00:09,971 --> 00:00:12,853
That is the link to the slides, so you can find them online.

4
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:14,434
I will show the QR code at the end.

5
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:16,996
You don't have to take photos or anything.

6
00:00:18,397 --> 00:00:18,557
Right.

7
00:00:19,538 --> 00:00:21,879
So welcome to my talk about Subnautica

8
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:25,142
and what that all meant to us and how we did it.

9
00:00:26,483 --> 00:00:28,824
Before I start, let me give a brief introduction

10
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:32,567
to the game itself, if my slides are working.

11
00:00:33,368 --> 00:00:33,688
They are not.

12
00:00:35,017 --> 00:00:35,697
That's a good start.

13
00:00:36,657 --> 00:00:37,698
OK, here we go.

14
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:38,458
Here we go.

15
00:00:38,698 --> 00:00:40,959
OK, so what is Subnautica, right?

16
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,181
Subnautica is a first-person, single-player, underwater

17
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:45,761
adventure.

18
00:00:47,182 --> 00:00:49,343
It's not an adventure game, but it's an adventure.

19
00:00:50,423 --> 00:00:55,125
So you crash land on an alien planet, and you dive in, and

20
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:56,386
you scavenge resources.

21
00:00:57,447 --> 00:01:00,049
and you craft and build to survive.

22
00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:03,852
You build some tools and some vehicles,

23
00:01:04,853 --> 00:01:07,455
and of course you drive those vehicles around.

24
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:11,799
And later in the game, you build some really cool habitats,

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,944
and you can customize them to your liking.

26
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:21,087
And you can bring your vehicles into the habitats,

27
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:23,269
and that's really cool, and you can upgrade them.

28
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,512
And you explore this big open world

29
00:01:28,212 --> 00:01:34,576
full of diverse biomes and caves and threats

30
00:01:34,977 --> 00:01:36,918
and even bigger threats.

31
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,841
And there's a lot of mystery somewhere in the world.

32
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:48,025
There's even more mystery and spectacle, of course.

33
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:51,267
We put a lot of spectacle into the game.

34
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:57,720
And so you unravel the story by going down all the way

35
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,004
to the core of the planet to discover the secret.

36
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:06,168
And when you've done all that, you build a rocket

37
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:08,471
and you blast off home, and the end.

38
00:02:10,113 --> 00:02:11,834
Sorry for spoiling, if anyone has a plan.

39
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:19,463
So, like I said, Subnautica is a first-person, single-player underwater adventure,

40
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:26,030
but it's also an open-world exploration, sandbox survival game with a story.

41
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:27,251
It's a lot of things.

42
00:02:29,198 --> 00:02:33,061
Let's just for a second to give you a frame of reference here.

43
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:34,903
Let's talk about Spinnautica as a product.

44
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:38,286
So it was released on PC and Mac last year

45
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:43,090
at a price point of $25 on Steam.

46
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,693
And we were in early access for three years.

47
00:02:45,913 --> 00:02:48,575
And during that time, we sold 2 million copies.

48
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,938
I think we sold another two last year.

49
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:59,168
We had 50K concurrent players on launch and about a 93%

50
00:02:59,548 --> 00:03:01,069
positive user review rating.

51
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,630
Last year we were at 60K.

52
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,811
I'm not sure what the number is now.

53
00:03:05,691 --> 00:03:05,951
87% Metacritic.

54
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,651
And we're also on lots of other consoles now.

55
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:13,892
Xbox, PlayStation came out in December.

56
00:03:14,572 --> 00:03:16,933
We're on lots of other platforms and stores,

57
00:03:16,974 --> 00:03:18,714
like Discord and Epic and all that.

58
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:22,756
And suffice to say that Subnautica

59
00:03:22,796 --> 00:03:24,797
was commercially successful.

60
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:26,117
You do the numbers.

61
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:30,759
But how did we make it, right?

62
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:31,540
How did we build it?

63
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,160
Let me take you behind the scenes here.

64
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,121
That's why you're here.

65
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:37,200
So we started with a plan.

66
00:03:37,581 --> 00:03:40,064
We made Natural Selection 2 before,

67
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:41,226
and that took a long time,

68
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:43,009
so we wanted to make something small.

69
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:48,076
And maybe in Unity, because we did our own engine before,

70
00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:49,979
and that was a lot of work.

71
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,320
And maybe something casual, maybe with a small team,

72
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,342
you know, four people, six months, really easy, right?

73
00:03:58,362 --> 00:04:00,783
And then reality kicked in,

74
00:04:00,984 --> 00:04:03,425
and we ended up with this big project.

75
00:04:03,965 --> 00:04:05,125
We're still using Unity,

76
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:10,128
but we're targeting PC and console powerful hardware now,

77
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:15,850
with a team of 25 over the course of five long years.

78
00:04:16,731 --> 00:04:19,772
And that, of course, costs 10 million US dollars to make.

79
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:22,108
That was not the plan.

80
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,533
So how did that happen?

81
00:04:27,314 --> 00:04:28,816
And where did all the money come from?

82
00:04:29,717 --> 00:04:30,958
That's what I'm going to talk about.

83
00:04:33,618 --> 00:04:35,499
When we started, we started with an idea.

84
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,660
We, Underworld Entertainment, is a small indie company.

85
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,541
We have an office here in San Francisco.

86
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:46,181
And we're just a few people.

87
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:48,102
We cannot compete with AAA.

88
00:04:48,942 --> 00:04:52,863
So instead of trying to compete, we just make original games,

89
00:04:52,963 --> 00:04:53,883
original IP.

90
00:04:54,783 --> 00:04:56,544
And there's kind of a book on that.

91
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:58,324
It's called Blue Ocean Strategy, which

92
00:04:58,384 --> 00:05:01,385
is about finding uncontested market space.

93
00:05:01,705 --> 00:05:03,445
Maybe we took it a little bit too literal here.

94
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,523
So in our case, the year is 2013.

95
00:05:09,583 --> 00:05:11,784
I'm not sure if you remember, but Minecraft

96
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:13,506
was hugely successful.

97
00:05:13,626 --> 00:05:15,928
And Don't Starve just came out and created

98
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:18,150
the entire genre of survival games.

99
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,673
And we were like, what if we made a game like Minecraft

100
00:05:22,693 --> 00:05:23,394
but underwater?

101
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:29,821
like a survival sandbox game with diving and no guns.

102
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:32,343
That was important to us because there was Sandy Hook

103
00:05:32,383 --> 00:05:34,144
just before and we felt like, okay,

104
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:37,067
maybe we shouldn't add more guns to the world.

105
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:43,291
And as you all know, like there are thousands

106
00:05:43,311 --> 00:05:44,352
of indie games out there.

107
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:47,274
There's this sea of games and we want to be that

108
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:50,496
spiky bubble and not a generic bubble.

109
00:05:51,766 --> 00:05:57,470
You might have seen this before because we stole this from Jamie Chang of Klee Entertainment, right?

110
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,213
This is his GDC talk. It was 2016, I think.

111
00:06:02,373 --> 00:06:05,035
Very good talk. Absolutely go watch it.

112
00:06:07,077 --> 00:06:09,298
The point of that talk is be something, right?

113
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:15,462
The spikes will alienate some players, but other players will love it even more.

114
00:06:15,602 --> 00:06:16,743
And that's a good thing.

115
00:06:17,604 --> 00:06:20,385
If you try to please everyone, you will just end up pleasing no one.

116
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:25,683
So we sat down and we figured out what are our spikes?

117
00:06:25,783 --> 00:06:28,485
What should our game be like?

118
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:30,126
What should it be about?

119
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:33,308
So we came up with this.

120
00:06:33,408 --> 00:06:39,772
We want this underwater sci-fi theme,

121
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:42,753
because we just like sci-fi.

122
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:45,035
And underwater was kind of unexplored, right?

123
00:06:46,315 --> 00:06:48,757
Where you design and build custom submarines,

124
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:50,878
and you.

125
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:56,790
You explore a procedural world and all that without guns.

126
00:06:57,931 --> 00:06:59,653
That was our initial pitch.

127
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:03,198
And so we built some prototypes

128
00:07:03,678 --> 00:07:05,781
just to see if we can make that work.

129
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:07,704
This is the first prototype.

130
00:07:08,184 --> 00:07:08,685
It looks ugly.

131
00:07:12,343 --> 00:07:16,105
So we had this modular vessel building in there,

132
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:20,067
where you were building your submarine out of little rooms.

133
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:23,828
And then you had this modular control scheme

134
00:07:23,868 --> 00:07:26,069
where you were kind of like multiplayer co-oping

135
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:28,270
to pilot the submarine.

136
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:30,751
And that was not fun.

137
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,992
That was super tedious.

138
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:32,652
That was terrible.

139
00:07:34,106 --> 00:07:37,450
So we ditched all that, we ditched the modular controls,

140
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,953
we switched to something that looks more

141
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,014
like a proper submarine.

142
00:07:42,036 --> 00:07:43,698
And that was actually pretty good,

143
00:07:43,818 --> 00:07:46,661
but it was also pretty boring.

144
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:51,428
So we came up with this.

145
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:54,150
We made it so that when you drive into things

146
00:07:54,191 --> 00:07:57,133
or when you dive too deep, your submarine floods.

147
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:02,417
And it makes sounds and stuff, and you have to repair it.

148
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,759
And that already is really exciting

149
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,701
and provides a lot of tension in the game

150
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:09,382
without any violence.

151
00:08:11,397 --> 00:08:12,138
So that was good.

152
00:08:12,398 --> 00:08:16,383
And then our core came together, where you dive, right?

153
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:18,786
And then you gather some loot, and then you craft something.

154
00:08:18,826 --> 00:08:21,289
And then it allows you to dive some more.

155
00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:24,653
And eventually, you build your submarine.

156
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:26,816
Because we realized it's

157
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:30,987
For this kind of game, it's good if you start with nothing

158
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:32,268
and you work your way up.

159
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:36,430
So eventually, we replaced the starting submarine

160
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:40,513
with just a static room, which had a little construction

161
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,234
station in there.

162
00:08:41,374 --> 00:08:43,956
And then you had a recipe for the submarine.

163
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:46,177
And we didn't even have to tell you what to do.

164
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:48,238
You knew you wanted a submarine.

165
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,220
So.

166
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:59,331
So in summary, what was good about the prototypes was the underwater open world theme worked

167
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:04,839
really nicely and running out of oxygen and flooding, that was scary, so that was good

168
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,280
tension.

169
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:11,563
And there was a good initial tech progression through the craft tree and the recipes there.

170
00:09:12,264 --> 00:09:17,765
But what I'm really trying to say here is that the right emotions were there.

171
00:09:18,566 --> 00:09:23,587
These things are good because there's emotion attached to them.

172
00:09:23,907 --> 00:09:28,729
The emotion of the feelings of wonder and fear and the joy of discovery,

173
00:09:28,869 --> 00:09:32,850
tension and intrinsic rewards, all those are feelings.

174
00:09:33,804 --> 00:09:37,845
And that's also why these modular submarines

175
00:09:37,865 --> 00:09:41,006
with the modular controls weren't working,

176
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:45,308
because we failed to make them emotionally impactful.

177
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:50,329
And that's actually a core principle at UWE.

178
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:55,351
We try to see, we try to design for emotions, first

179
00:09:55,391 --> 00:09:56,052
and foremost.

180
00:09:57,841 --> 00:09:59,162
And it's done really well for us.

181
00:10:00,663 --> 00:10:03,304
So if you want to hear more about that, a deep dive

182
00:10:03,344 --> 00:10:05,485
into that very topic, tomorrow we

183
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,046
have another talk about Subnautica,

184
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:11,369
the design of Subnautica, by my boss, Charlie, tomorrow

185
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:12,209
9 AM.

186
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:19,553
And it's all about the designing stuff and the reframing.

187
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:22,455
And Charlie's a brilliant guy.

188
00:10:22,475 --> 00:10:22,535
And.

189
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:27,827
Like, just listening to him will blow your mind.

190
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:30,669
I have to say that because he's my boss, right?

191
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,132
But I also really mean it.

192
00:10:34,273 --> 00:10:36,935
Like, I wouldn't work for this company if it wasn't for him.

193
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:40,958
So I do recommend that if you're interested in design.

194
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,042
Anyway, while we were busy prototyping,

195
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:49,026
our art director has been really busy.

196
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:51,933
making art, concept art, right?

197
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:55,476
So he was drawing these coral reefs

198
00:10:55,837 --> 00:11:00,341
and filled with wonder and peril

199
00:11:00,561 --> 00:11:02,563
and there was a lot going on.

200
00:11:02,723 --> 00:11:06,747
And our only problem was that our prototypes

201
00:11:06,787 --> 00:11:08,809
did not look like that, like at all.

202
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:15,178
Is it even possible to get this visual fidelity?

203
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:20,343
So we tried to come up with another goal for ourselves.

204
00:11:20,403 --> 00:11:23,526
We wanted to build a new prototype

205
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:24,947
to match the concept art.

206
00:11:24,987 --> 00:11:28,931
Like no big gameplay, just match the concept art, right?

207
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:30,032
Just free form diving.

208
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:33,596
This is the concept and this is in game.

209
00:11:34,296 --> 00:11:35,137
That was good enough.

210
00:11:37,883 --> 00:11:41,065
And we showed that to the public at PAX 2014.

211
00:11:41,665 --> 00:11:46,827
And like I said, there was no game loop in there.

212
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:48,407
There was no crafting or anything.

213
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:51,988
But the feedback we got was good anyway,

214
00:11:52,749 --> 00:11:55,090
because the right feelings were there.

215
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:00,051
People were really feeling awe and wonder and fear.

216
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:03,413
And they just hate the ocean.

217
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:10,309
And that's a good thing that translates directly

218
00:12:10,349 --> 00:12:11,170
into the game world.

219
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,091
If you have something like that, that's pure gold.

220
00:12:15,271 --> 00:12:17,832
So OK, let's update our spikes here for a second,

221
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:21,034
because it's not what we initially envisioned.

222
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:26,356
The modular submarines, that did not work out, so screw that.

223
00:12:27,257 --> 00:12:31,039
And for the demo, we made a handmade world.

224
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:32,860
Everything was hand placed.

225
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,041
Everything was hand shaped.

226
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:38,063
And that was so much better than anything we procedurally

227
00:12:38,143 --> 00:12:39,103
generated before.

228
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:42,025
So forget about procedural world.

229
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:45,006
We're going to just hand build the entire thing.

230
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:52,621
But we realize, okay, people really fear the ocean,

231
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:56,265
so let's exploit the hell out of that.

232
00:12:56,365 --> 00:12:57,646
That's gonna be a good product.

233
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,268
All right.

234
00:13:00,554 --> 00:13:04,677
We are confident enough in the potential of our games

235
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:08,740
to move forward, so we build a minimum viable product.

236
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:12,303
And that's when you have to get your priorities straight.

237
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:16,005
So in our case, we saw that it's really difficult

238
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,027
to make this run even just on PC

239
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:19,968
without terrible frame rate and hitching.

240
00:13:20,048 --> 00:13:23,171
So no more iPhone, no more tablets, whatever,

241
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:25,512
just focus on really powerful, beefy hardware.

242
00:13:27,314 --> 00:13:29,395
Keep the good look, bring back the crafting.

243
00:13:30,848 --> 00:13:33,528
make it single player first, that's difficult enough,

244
00:13:33,848 --> 00:13:36,449
and then hand build the entire world

245
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:39,229
because procedural just didn't work for us.

246
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:44,390
And as you might realize, that requires art

247
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,091
and level design and voxel editing tools,

248
00:13:47,211 --> 00:13:49,931
and we had to bring more and more people on the team,

249
00:13:49,991 --> 00:13:53,632
and we went quickly from four to more like 20.

250
00:13:56,392 --> 00:13:59,553
And half a year later, we kind of had the combination

251
00:13:59,613 --> 00:14:00,033
between.

252
00:14:00,902 --> 00:14:04,584
the gameplay prototypes and the visual demo

253
00:14:04,604 --> 00:14:05,804
that I just showed you.

254
00:14:06,605 --> 00:14:10,587
And we felt, OK, we need to get some real feedback on this now.

255
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:14,008
We have to open our doors and see what

256
00:14:14,048 --> 00:14:15,149
people are actually thinking.

257
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:19,411
So we started selling the game earliest access

258
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:21,172
on our own website.

259
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:29,271
And because it's an open world game, it's kind of like difficult to understand are people

260
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:30,954
even enjoying it or what are they doing.

261
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:36,322
So we added telemetry and feedback systems to the game.

262
00:14:36,982 --> 00:14:37,642
Let me show you that.

263
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:39,903
So here we go.

264
00:14:41,543 --> 00:14:45,444
At any point in the game, if you press Escape or you press

265
00:14:45,464 --> 00:14:49,565
F8, you can give feedback.

266
00:14:50,545 --> 00:14:52,886
And it opens up a little form where you

267
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,106
can send us a message.

268
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,411
directly to us.

269
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:58,953
You report any issues, send us screenshots,

270
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,094
tell us whether you're angry or happy

271
00:15:01,254 --> 00:15:04,816
or when you found a bug, right there in the game.

272
00:15:06,357 --> 00:15:09,259
And that feedback then goes to our back end server

273
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,261
where we aggregate it and analyze it.

274
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:15,943
And if you want to have a look, that's

275
00:15:15,963 --> 00:15:17,664
the link to our feedback server.

276
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:21,286
You can absolutely have a look at all the feedback tickets

277
00:15:21,327 --> 00:15:22,607
because they are all public.

278
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,023
And I should mention, there's absolutely no personally

279
00:15:30,203 --> 00:15:33,065
identifiable information or anything in there.

280
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:35,647
We're not interested in selling anyone ads or

281
00:15:35,707 --> 00:15:39,230
something, we're interested in global trends and in making

282
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:39,870
the game better.

283
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:45,034
So this is all fine and not covered by GDPR or something.

284
00:15:46,715 --> 00:15:47,916
Here's an example of a global trend.

285
00:15:50,438 --> 00:15:54,429
We shipped an update and our happy tickets went up,

286
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:55,392
went way up.

287
00:15:56,214 --> 00:15:57,136
Updates are a good thing.

288
00:15:57,698 --> 00:15:58,239
You can see that.

289
00:16:00,646 --> 00:16:04,907
And we also send the player's position together

290
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:05,607
with the feedback.

291
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:10,549
So here you see all the happy dots, the positions

292
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:12,489
where people are happy about our game.

293
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,531
So as you can see in the middle, there's a lot of dots,

294
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:18,471
because that's where the game starts naturally.

295
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,952
But then you can see some clusters and some patterns

296
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:23,453
emerging out of those.

297
00:16:24,813 --> 00:16:30,657
And it turns out those were the areas where people thought our world looks really beautiful.

298
00:16:30,998 --> 00:16:33,760
And they wanted to tell us that it's really nice.

299
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,362
So we knew what to do more of and we could go from there.

300
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:44,113
And so in addition to the feedback system,

301
00:16:44,173 --> 00:16:46,836
the manual system where you can send us something,

302
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:51,321
we also put in telemetry, or analytics,

303
00:16:51,461 --> 00:16:52,502
or whatever you call that.

304
00:16:53,103 --> 00:16:55,165
So for example, every now and then we

305
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:56,827
send the player's position, which

306
00:16:56,947 --> 00:16:58,188
allows us to build heat maps.

307
00:16:59,124 --> 00:17:03,426
And again, the game is centered around the life pod in

308
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:04,646
the middle of the map.

309
00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:07,927
So naturally, you get a lot of heat right there.

310
00:17:08,888 --> 00:17:15,130
But you can totally see that, for example, here, there are a

311
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,491
lot of green dots over there.

312
00:17:16,571 --> 00:17:18,091
And what that means is that

313
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:22,074
Now, players always wanted to swim there.

314
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:25,036
And what is there?

315
00:17:25,116 --> 00:17:26,117
Well, it's that.

316
00:17:26,477 --> 00:17:29,540
It's the big crash ship that we put on the horizon

317
00:17:31,561 --> 00:17:32,362
as a landmark.

318
00:17:32,742 --> 00:17:35,184
But the problem is that it's just a billboard.

319
00:17:36,104 --> 00:17:39,167
That's basically, we thought of it as Skybox, right?

320
00:17:39,187 --> 00:17:40,468
The game is underwater.

321
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:42,870
But when the player, the player doesn't know that.

322
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,771
And then they start the game, and they see that.

323
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:47,093
And then they are like, oh, the game must be over there.

324
00:17:47,753 --> 00:17:48,514
So they go there.

325
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:50,881
And that's not good.

326
00:17:50,941 --> 00:17:51,942
That's not what we want.

327
00:17:52,963 --> 00:17:54,864
But we wanted to keep the landmarks.

328
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:59,488
So we came up with this idea, OK, we put radiation in the

329
00:17:59,508 --> 00:18:02,971
game, and so this is a crashed ship, and it leaks radiation

330
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:03,892
into the ocean.

331
00:18:04,492 --> 00:18:08,195
And so as you get closer, your Geiger counter goes up, and

332
00:18:08,556 --> 00:18:10,578
you realize, OK, maybe I shouldn't go there.

333
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:12,379
And that helped.

334
00:18:15,782 --> 00:18:18,284
Two months later, we ran out of money.

335
00:18:19,802 --> 00:18:23,645
So we wanted to get more money in,

336
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:26,688
we put the game on Steam Early Access.

337
00:18:27,308 --> 00:18:28,169
And that was December 2014.

338
00:18:31,912 --> 00:18:37,173
The game was in a relatively similar state to what you've seen before, but we moved all

339
00:18:37,213 --> 00:18:43,014
the good loot to where the sharks were, and that created a lot of excitement.

340
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:45,895
We saw that in the feedback tickets.

341
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:47,336
That was cool.

342
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:53,497
And we also added these super big whale-like creatures called the Reefbacks.

343
00:18:54,642 --> 00:18:55,863
They are absolutely harmless.

344
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:56,743
They don't do anything.

345
00:18:56,763 --> 00:18:58,723
They just float around and moan.

346
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:02,784
And people freak out when they see them.

347
00:19:04,585 --> 00:19:07,585
And they talk about Cthulhu and stuff.

348
00:19:09,126 --> 00:19:12,047
And again, we know that people freak out because we're

349
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,287
getting the feedback tickets.

350
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:17,108
So we see there's a huge reaction to these creatures,

351
00:19:17,268 --> 00:19:19,989
even though there's no gameplay to them.

352
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:22,229
Let's do more of that, for sure.

353
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,070
That's a good idea.

354
00:19:25,553 --> 00:19:25,833
All right.

355
00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:31,458
And also people were telling us that we were making a horror

356
00:19:31,478 --> 00:19:34,280
game here, which was never our intent.

357
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:40,485
But maybe if it goes that way, maybe it's

358
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:41,366
meant to be like that.

359
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:46,710
But our sales numbers were still not good, not enough for

360
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,412
us to keep going, not enough for us to survive.

361
00:19:50,053 --> 00:19:53,156
So we needed something to move the needle.

362
00:19:53,556 --> 00:19:54,557
And we needed it fast.

363
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:58,991
And we so we had to decide what to what are priorities.

364
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,414
And I'm sure many of you are familiar with this kind of

365
00:20:02,474 --> 00:20:07,980
situation where you are like in dire needs and what what are

366
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,021
you supposed to do now.

367
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,483
So our suggestion would be this.

368
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:17,540
Look at your spikes and focus what makes your game stand out

369
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:19,122
and do more of that.

370
00:20:19,582 --> 00:20:20,983
Forget anything else.

371
00:20:21,264 --> 00:20:25,547
So in our case, underwater accidental horror and theme,

372
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:27,089
that works really well.

373
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:29,911
So we want to do features that are

374
00:20:29,931 --> 00:20:33,034
concrete and emotional and straightforward to implement.

375
00:20:33,694 --> 00:20:37,558
And everything else, cut it or at least defer it.

376
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:43,520
And we kept our heads up, and we shipped monthly updates.

377
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,823
And we added more world and more stuff and all that, of course.

378
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:52,886
But most importantly, each of these updates

379
00:20:52,946 --> 00:20:56,328
had a headliner feature, a big thing to call out.

380
00:20:56,448 --> 00:20:59,230
So for example, one of them was the Cyclops submarine.

381
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:02,112
And another update was the Reaper Leviathan.

382
00:21:03,153 --> 00:21:08,637
That one actually does eat you and is responsible for probably

383
00:21:08,677 --> 00:21:09,077
50% of our sales.

384
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,012
And the Cyclops submarine was also really well received

385
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,333
because that's a little bit unsurprising

386
00:21:19,373 --> 00:21:22,375
because it's an underwater exploration game, right?

387
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:27,477
But anyway, so definitely tie that in more with the gameplay.

388
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:28,738
That was the lesson here.

389
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,780
And like I said, we put out these updates

390
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,061
and of course when you do that,

391
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:36,642
you also have to talk about them, right?

392
00:21:36,682 --> 00:21:40,204
So we did a lot of blogging and tweeting

393
00:21:40,464 --> 00:21:42,945
and newsletters to our mailing list.

394
00:21:43,715 --> 00:21:46,836
And for each update, we made a little website

395
00:21:46,956 --> 00:21:50,597
with a little video, which is a neat trick

396
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:51,658
we learned from Valve.

397
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,459
They did that for Team Fortress 2.

398
00:21:54,499 --> 00:21:59,280
There's the QR code to their talk, really good talk.

399
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:06,803
Not just on games as a service, like the title says,

400
00:22:06,863 --> 00:22:09,604
but on communication in general.

401
00:22:10,304 --> 00:22:11,285
Really, really recommend it.

402
00:22:14,077 --> 00:22:18,040
So that's all good, but probably the best thing we did

403
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:22,524
was to open up our Trello board, our task tracking board,

404
00:22:23,484 --> 00:22:26,687
to the public, and you can just see everything.

405
00:22:27,487 --> 00:22:30,290
Our day-to-day tasks, it's all public

406
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:34,313
with all the details, all the little bits, everything.

407
00:22:35,473 --> 00:22:39,396
And because we are all remote, our team is completely remote

408
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,258
around the country, around the.

409
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:45,776
around the globe, in fact, our Trello board actually

410
00:22:45,836 --> 00:22:48,779
contains all our tasks and everything is on there

411
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:50,700
because we don't have a whiteboard or something

412
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:52,942
in the office where you can hide something.

413
00:22:53,183 --> 00:22:54,604
So that's the real deal.

414
00:22:56,105 --> 00:23:00,029
And in addition to that, we also made our commit messages

415
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:02,131
to our version control system public.

416
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:04,092
They go live to our Twitter.

417
00:23:04,773 --> 00:23:07,395
So people can see live what we are working on.

418
00:23:08,803 --> 00:23:12,744
In fact, people can play live what we are working on,

419
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:16,265
because we are uploading daily builds to Steam,

420
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:20,367
where they are available on the experimental branch.

421
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:21,967
And we tell people about it.

422
00:23:22,007 --> 00:23:23,908
There's no password or anything for that branch.

423
00:23:23,948 --> 00:23:26,169
You just have to go to that branch.

424
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:28,270
And it's a broken mess.

425
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,110
I mean, of course it's a broken mess,

426
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:33,351
but 20% of our players love it.

427
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:38,300
Every day, there's new features or horrible bugs to discover.

428
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:38,840
Who knows?

429
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:41,781
Like, it's exciting.

430
00:23:43,002 --> 00:23:45,182
And they are right on the bleeding edge, right?

431
00:23:45,402 --> 00:23:46,303
It's bleeding for sure.

432
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:51,064
But for us, it's free playtesting.

433
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:54,785
There are thousands of people out there

434
00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:56,746
who scrutinize our every check-in.

435
00:23:57,166 --> 00:24:00,287
You should see how fast a programmer fixes that damn bug

436
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:02,208
if 3,000 people are complaining.

437
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:08,799
That really stabilizes the product really fast.

438
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:12,902
I recommend that, just for that, just for that alone.

439
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:19,488
And in terms of sales, we were starting to gain traction.

440
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:22,591
More and more people were coming in and buying our game.

441
00:24:24,052 --> 00:24:24,272
Why?

442
00:24:25,593 --> 00:24:26,254
Just one word.

443
00:24:27,295 --> 00:24:27,755
Streamers.

444
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:32,319
Streamers are your sales people.

445
00:24:33,655 --> 00:24:35,677
in this brand new world we're living in.

446
00:24:35,697 --> 00:24:39,460
The first ones to discover our game

447
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,341
were small and medium-sized streamers,

448
00:24:42,362 --> 00:24:43,963
and then came bigger and bigger ones.

449
00:24:44,624 --> 00:24:47,826
And by April 2015, so half a year

450
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,090
after we released our game on earliest access,

451
00:24:53,671 --> 00:24:56,833
we hit Jacksepticeye with like 4 million subscribers

452
00:24:56,893 --> 00:24:57,434
at that time.

453
00:24:59,556 --> 00:25:02,297
And he made a video about Svobodka every single week

454
00:25:03,098 --> 00:25:04,418
for 20 weeks.

455
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:06,819
And then another 20.

456
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,060
And then another 20.

457
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:16,203
That's 250 million views just from one YouTuber.

458
00:25:17,443 --> 00:25:20,164
And those viewers, I mean, a fraction of those viewers

459
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:21,685
turned into buyers, right?

460
00:25:22,912 --> 00:25:27,137
And even if they don't turn into buyers, they are still spreading the word.

461
00:25:27,377 --> 00:25:29,920
They are still telling their friends about it.

462
00:25:30,361 --> 00:25:33,644
They still belong to our community.

463
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,649
They're kind of like our free-to-play players, if you want.

464
00:25:40,513 --> 00:25:42,095
And two notes about this here.

465
00:25:43,465 --> 00:25:46,226
First, when you design for emotions,

466
00:25:46,807 --> 00:25:48,867
you get a lot of excitement on the streams.

467
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,469
And that's exactly what streamers are looking for,

468
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:54,309
because it entertains their audience.

469
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:55,470
And that is good.

470
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:59,751
I think that's one of the major reasons why a lot of streamers

471
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:00,992
really like Subnautica.

472
00:26:01,052 --> 00:26:02,992
It's not because of great game or anything.

473
00:26:03,052 --> 00:26:07,774
No, it's because they can make good entertainment out of it.

474
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,335
So keep that in mind when you design.

475
00:26:12,665 --> 00:26:19,249
a game. And the second thing, which was like really valuable to us, is streamers are essentially

476
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:26,912
playtesters. You can watch their stream and you can watch their face and you can see what

477
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:35,436
they understood, what worked and what didn't. Whether it worked out the way you wanted it

478
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:36,037
to work out.

479
00:26:36,942 --> 00:26:43,189
Our game is completely non-linear, so that's super, super important to us to see if people get it, right?

480
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:52,078
And so this was invaluable for us to straighten out the onboarding experience in like the early, like, 30 minutes of the game.

481
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:53,980
So invaluable.

482
00:26:55,922 --> 00:26:58,445
Anyway, so we basically...

483
00:27:01,064 --> 00:27:04,606
We basically went from near bankruptcy

484
00:27:04,627 --> 00:27:07,969
to virtually infinite runway overnight.

485
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,571
More and more money was coming in

486
00:27:10,911 --> 00:27:13,192
than we were paying the bills, right?

487
00:27:13,873 --> 00:27:17,175
So we could have developed this game forever,

488
00:27:18,156 --> 00:27:20,237
which sounds like a pleasant thing,

489
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:22,158
but when you really think about it, it's not.

490
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,090
So where do you go from there, right?

491
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,731
And how do you keep up the pace?

492
00:27:28,952 --> 00:27:30,813
And how do you keep your focus?

493
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:36,536
So how do you deliver a great update every single month

494
00:27:36,676 --> 00:27:38,878
to keep this machine going?

495
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,539
We made a roadmap.

496
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:49,196
Our goal was to leverage existing systems and build,

497
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:53,639
add stuff that gels with what we already have, right?

498
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,883
So one classic example would be base building,

499
00:27:58,484 --> 00:27:59,945
or also known as shelter,

500
00:28:00,626 --> 00:28:04,489
which comes with building outposts,

501
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:06,551
so you can venture out further and further,

502
00:28:06,971 --> 00:28:08,893
which is great for exploration.

503
00:28:09,794 --> 00:28:14,356
And it comes with farming, so that helps with survival gameplay, right?

504
00:28:15,317 --> 00:28:19,839
And then there's the moon pool, where you can, like, dock your vehicle and upgrade it.

505
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:21,600
So that's tech progression.

506
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,102
And then there's the map room, which helps you to scan...

507
00:28:27,783 --> 00:28:28,864
scan for resources.

508
00:28:30,457 --> 00:28:32,038
which then helps you progress further.

509
00:28:32,138 --> 00:28:35,179
So that all gels with existing systems.

510
00:28:35,939 --> 00:28:38,140
And, but what I'm really trying to say again

511
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,381
is that these are things that the player already cares about.

512
00:28:42,441 --> 00:28:45,642
These are things that the player's already emotionally

513
00:28:45,722 --> 00:28:50,784
attached to and intrinsically wants them,

514
00:28:50,884 --> 00:28:52,644
intrinsically understands the value.

515
00:28:53,084 --> 00:28:54,665
That's the main thing here.

516
00:28:58,986 --> 00:29:04,785
And we also finally caved and replaced the Aurora billboard.

517
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,633
with the proper 3D model on the horizon

518
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:10,516
and made it explorable inside.

519
00:29:10,596 --> 00:29:13,839
So we explode the entire thing and then you can go inside

520
00:29:13,899 --> 00:29:17,401
because despite the radiation that we added around it,

521
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:21,365
we saw that people still wanted to go there.

522
00:29:21,445 --> 00:29:24,067
And then they were like, oh no, the ecosystem,

523
00:29:24,147 --> 00:29:25,828
I want to fix the radiation, right?

524
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:27,530
I'm destroying the planet.

525
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:27,890
So.

526
00:29:29,156 --> 00:29:30,878
We saw that by watching the streamers play.

527
00:29:31,018 --> 00:29:33,361
And if you know what your audience wants,

528
00:29:34,142 --> 00:29:35,584
and if it fits your game,

529
00:29:36,044 --> 00:29:37,686
might as well give them what they want.

530
00:29:38,447 --> 00:29:39,168
Was great.

531
00:29:39,328 --> 00:29:41,451
Everyone understood that this was like a mission

532
00:29:41,491 --> 00:29:42,232
or something to do.

533
00:29:42,653 --> 00:29:43,714
We didn't have to tell them.

534
00:29:45,527 --> 00:29:48,669
And remember when I told you about telemetry,

535
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:50,710
about the telemetry system we put in the game?

536
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:56,214
Well, so we track every single item the players craft,

537
00:29:56,415 --> 00:29:58,156
every single base piece they build,

538
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:01,498
every single submarine they build, everything.

539
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:07,713
That allows us to understand what people are doing

540
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:10,796
and in which order, which is super important

541
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:12,217
in an open world game where you want

542
00:30:12,237 --> 00:30:14,979
to have any sense of pacing or progression.

543
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:21,004
So we were able to get the data, evaluate the pacing,

544
00:30:21,365 --> 00:30:23,586
look at it if it's like the way we want it to be.

545
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:28,929
and then tune our loot placement and our tech progression

546
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,351
and our level design based on actual data.

547
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:36,053
And that's really much better than sitting in meetings

548
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:38,814
and trying to figure it out on a piece of paper.

549
00:30:40,816 --> 00:30:44,938
And if you want to do something similar like that, well,

550
00:30:45,699 --> 00:30:48,620
so we started with Unity Analytics.

551
00:30:49,101 --> 00:30:51,422
And it comes with a bunch of things built in.

552
00:30:51,522 --> 00:30:53,903
But then we really had to download the raw data.

553
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:58,304
and write our own data processing tools

554
00:30:58,364 --> 00:31:00,927
because the things that we are interested in

555
00:31:01,188 --> 00:31:02,369
don't really fall out of it.

556
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,973
But that's no longer an option

557
00:31:06,034 --> 00:31:09,037
because Unity Analytics violates GDPR,

558
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,120
so that's out.

559
00:31:12,602 --> 00:31:14,643
Chances are if you want to do telemetry,

560
00:31:14,683 --> 00:31:16,424
you will have to roll your own solution.

561
00:31:16,544 --> 00:31:21,847
And you can try to use something for web analytics.

562
00:31:22,067 --> 00:31:24,889
And if you basically treat events in the game

563
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:26,550
like, OK, a player crafted an item,

564
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,612
it's like a player visited this website,

565
00:31:30,812 --> 00:31:32,173
you're basically 80% there.

566
00:31:32,614 --> 00:31:34,595
It's similar-ish.

567
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:37,576
And then the rest you have to just manually do it.

568
00:31:37,757 --> 00:31:38,077
It's sad.

569
00:31:40,201 --> 00:31:41,283
That's where we stand right now.

570
00:31:41,664 --> 00:31:45,334
So that's it for quantitative feedback, right, for numbers.

571
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,780
And for qualitative feedback...

572
00:31:49,215 --> 00:31:51,377
what just listen to what people are saying

573
00:31:51,437 --> 00:31:52,878
about your game on the internet.

574
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:57,681
And, and, and if you, if you listen to it

575
00:31:57,781 --> 00:32:00,203
and if you fix something that they complain about,

576
00:32:00,743 --> 00:32:03,885
or if you took a good suggestion from, from someone,

577
00:32:04,386 --> 00:32:06,887
call that out, call that out in your patch notes.

578
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:09,569
Like these are the patch note for dead cells

579
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:12,251
and they were in early access for a year.

580
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:17,535
They did super well, and they did even better than us

581
00:32:17,595 --> 00:32:18,636
with their patch notes.

582
00:32:18,716 --> 00:32:20,077
And they have talks here at GDC.

583
00:32:20,097 --> 00:32:20,517
Go to them.

584
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:22,939
I've heard them already.

585
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,261
They are really good talks.

586
00:32:25,922 --> 00:32:28,243
Make sure that the reason why you

587
00:32:28,303 --> 00:32:31,946
want to call that out when you take a suggestion

588
00:32:32,006 --> 00:32:34,188
is to make sure that people understand

589
00:32:34,228 --> 00:32:37,290
that they are in the loop, that they actually have power

590
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:39,412
over the creation of the game.

591
00:32:41,315 --> 00:32:45,862
that will grow a community and they will become your super fans

592
00:32:46,523 --> 00:32:47,946
and they will spread the word for you.

593
00:32:49,215 --> 00:32:51,536
So listening really is crucially important

594
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:53,617
to the entire process of early access.

595
00:32:54,117 --> 00:32:56,098
But don't take it from me,

596
00:32:56,158 --> 00:32:58,378
take it from the man himself, Chris Hecker.

597
00:32:58,618 --> 00:33:02,280
Like he has been out there with Spy Party

598
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:06,161
for years and years and it totally worked for him, right?

599
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:11,103
He was listening to his game and listening to his players

600
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:14,444
and he says that his game now is better

601
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:15,604
than he could have made it.

602
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,973
because of that.

603
00:33:18,493 --> 00:33:22,075
And that same thing is true for us.

604
00:33:22,195 --> 00:33:25,958
Like Subnautica ended up being way better

605
00:33:26,598 --> 00:33:29,900
than we could have made it behind closed doors.

606
00:33:32,182 --> 00:33:35,464
So what I'm saying here is that iteration is important,

607
00:33:35,504 --> 00:33:37,285
but the right kind of iteration.

608
00:33:37,706 --> 00:33:40,107
Iteration based on customer's feedback,

609
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:44,230
not your manager's opinion or your boss or your director.

610
00:33:45,431 --> 00:33:47,936
measure what actually works in the game

611
00:33:48,797 --> 00:33:51,702
instead of speculating about it in never-ending meetings.

612
00:33:52,223 --> 00:33:54,166
Like, get some data.

613
00:33:58,052 --> 00:34:00,674
And all that is good, and we were in early access

614
00:34:00,714 --> 00:34:02,556
for a really long time, and we were making

615
00:34:02,696 --> 00:34:05,918
this survival sandbox game where you start at the top,

616
00:34:05,958 --> 00:34:08,080
and then you explore further and further

617
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:08,941
and deeper and deeper.

618
00:34:08,961 --> 00:34:12,044
And we had this great little underwater adventure.

619
00:34:12,964 --> 00:34:15,126
And at some point, people are like,

620
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,949
okay, so what's the point?

621
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:19,070
Why explore?

622
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:20,551
Why survive?

623
00:34:21,132 --> 00:34:22,373
Is there even a point?

624
00:34:23,373 --> 00:34:24,034
Or is this like?

625
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:28,468
I mean, Minecraft was pointless for a long time, right?

626
00:34:30,177 --> 00:34:33,840
So we discussed many, many different solutions,

627
00:34:35,101 --> 00:34:37,443
but one stuck out for us.

628
00:34:38,264 --> 00:34:40,785
In the very, very early prototyping days,

629
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:43,928
one of our guys, our technical artist,

630
00:34:44,628 --> 00:34:46,570
had doodled something on a piece of paper.

631
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:51,674
And it was this epic chart of exploring the ocean,

632
00:34:51,754 --> 00:34:54,256
going deeper and deeper, building bigger

633
00:34:54,276 --> 00:34:57,358
and bigger submarines, and then going into caves.

634
00:34:57,438 --> 00:34:58,919
And eventually there are.

635
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,301
Aliens.

636
00:35:03,263 --> 00:35:03,864
And we liked that.

637
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:07,868
So we realized we need like a core narrative.

638
00:35:08,709 --> 00:35:12,512
Something to pull everything together to a final point.

639
00:35:14,975 --> 00:35:16,116
What we needed is a story.

640
00:35:16,897 --> 00:35:17,818
So we hired a writer,

641
00:35:18,859 --> 00:35:21,581
and he came up with a bunch of mysteries, including aliens.

642
00:35:23,029 --> 00:35:26,972
And so the story is eventually you build the rocket

643
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:29,515
and you escape the planet, right?

644
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:34,599
But that main story is implicit and it's all in your head.

645
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:39,864
What we tell instead is half a dozen minor storylines.

646
00:35:40,445 --> 00:35:41,586
Those are explicit.

647
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,267
And we tell them concurrently

648
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,129
and they have overlapping parts.

649
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,011
And they are all linear.

650
00:35:48,003 --> 00:35:55,645
But because you progress through them by player actions,

651
00:35:56,166 --> 00:35:57,886
it feels really non-linear.

652
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:02,208
We do that by monitoring the progress of the players.

653
00:36:02,288 --> 00:36:06,049
We monitor, I told you before, we monitor what you crafted.

654
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:07,390
We know if you have a knife.

655
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:10,971
We know if you have a sea glide or a submarine, a sea moth.

656
00:36:12,151 --> 00:36:15,173
We know which areas in the world you have discovered.

657
00:36:15,553 --> 00:36:19,835
And based on that, we can judge how far into the game are you.

658
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:22,696
And based on that, we can give you little story bits.

659
00:36:24,637 --> 00:36:27,698
And different stories are being advanced

660
00:36:27,798 --> 00:36:29,199
by different kind of things.

661
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:32,260
So depending on what you focus on,

662
00:36:33,081 --> 00:36:35,882
your story will play out totally different than someone else's

663
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:36,202
story.

664
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:48,082
And so one really simple example of that is by measuring what kind of oxygen tanks and

665
00:36:48,102 --> 00:36:51,348
vehicles you have, we can judge how deep you can dive.

666
00:36:52,729 --> 00:37:01,633
We know about how deep you can go before you die because your submarine implodes or you run out of oxygen.

667
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:05,435
And therefore we know which parts of the map you can actually reach.

668
00:37:06,135 --> 00:37:11,757
And therefore we know which loot you can potentially get because the loot is different in each biome.

669
00:37:13,078 --> 00:37:21,722
And so that's a relatively simple measure to understand how much progress you have made in the game,

670
00:37:22,463 --> 00:37:26,225
regardless of the hours you spend playing the game.

671
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,626
It could be 60, it could be 6, we don't know.

672
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:31,588
What is important is how far you are in terms of progress.

673
00:37:32,268 --> 00:37:35,189
And so we used that to advance one of the storylines,

674
00:37:35,249 --> 00:37:36,469
which is the infection.

675
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:37,989
Like there's this whole backstory

676
00:37:38,029 --> 00:37:39,410
where you are infected with bitcure.

677
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,030
And basically, the deeper you go,

678
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:44,091
the worse the infection gets, right?

679
00:37:44,291 --> 00:37:45,351
Super simple example.

680
00:37:45,691 --> 00:37:47,111
The other storylines are a little bit more

681
00:37:48,312 --> 00:37:49,172
complicated than that.

682
00:37:50,732 --> 00:37:55,613
Anyway, story was our last missing piece here.

683
00:37:56,314 --> 00:37:58,394
Story gave everything a purpose.

684
00:37:59,394 --> 00:38:00,735
And it really worked out well for us.

685
00:38:02,512 --> 00:38:05,994
And for sure, with three long years of early access

686
00:38:06,054 --> 00:38:08,736
and a big team, you can do a lot of things.

687
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:11,238
But don't let that fool you.

688
00:38:11,278 --> 00:38:13,299
We still cut a ton of feature.

689
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,783
But they were not really core, or we never

690
00:38:19,823 --> 00:38:21,824
managed to make them emotionally impactful.

691
00:38:21,864 --> 00:38:22,945
So that's fine.

692
00:38:22,965 --> 00:38:23,825
It's OK.

693
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:27,267
And I fully realize the irony here, right?

694
00:38:35,824 --> 00:38:40,167
standing here in front of you in a suit, telling you how easy and dandy that was.

695
00:38:40,388 --> 00:38:46,933
And my colleagues know me as this mad guy in the middle there, because...

696
00:38:51,282 --> 00:38:57,625
Because don't underestimate how hard it actually is to ship an update every single month, a

697
00:38:57,725 --> 00:39:04,848
valuable update, how hard it is to keep a product evolving over 3-4 years and to keep

698
00:39:04,888 --> 00:39:06,269
it playable at all times.

699
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:10,411
I was a programmer on the project, so ask me about it.

700
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:13,052
I mean, just try it, just try it.

701
00:39:16,413 --> 00:39:17,754
Anyway, I digress.

702
00:39:19,261 --> 00:39:23,924
Long story short, the results of three long years worth of

703
00:39:24,004 --> 00:39:26,966
monthly updates was growth and growth.

704
00:39:27,626 --> 00:39:31,869
And I cannot show you the sales graphs, but I can show

705
00:39:31,929 --> 00:39:33,290
you our concurrent players graphs.

706
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:35,771
And I can tell you that it correlates

707
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:36,732
with the sales graphs.

708
00:39:37,692 --> 00:39:42,734
And you can see those typical spikes around releases, updates,

709
00:39:43,395 --> 00:39:45,536
or when a streamer comes in and makes a video,

710
00:39:45,976 --> 00:39:47,797
or when it has a sales event, right?

711
00:39:47,837 --> 00:39:49,297
And then the long tail starts.

712
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:49,998
We all know that.

713
00:39:50,438 --> 00:39:54,379
But the point here is, before the long tail really goes down,

714
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,800
another spike comes in.

715
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,981
And it just keeps going and going.

716
00:39:58,201 --> 00:39:59,282
And that's the magic here.

717
00:40:00,302 --> 00:40:01,863
And I'm going to make a claim.

718
00:40:02,886 --> 00:40:07,870
that open development was the silver bullet that enabled this kind of growth.

719
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:16,698
I'm going to make the claim that open development fosters this kind of growth because you build

720
00:40:16,758 --> 00:40:21,762
something and you release it and you put it in front of players and streamers and cover

721
00:40:21,822 --> 00:40:27,648
it and then you get feedback from that. You watch the streams and then you iterate

722
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:30,010
over and over again.

723
00:40:31,435 --> 00:40:34,738
And at the same time, the new features that you build

724
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:37,060
give the streamers something to talk about,

725
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,883
which means new episodes, which means more views, which

726
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:45,767
means more buyers, which means more budget, which

727
00:40:45,827 --> 00:40:46,707
means more features.

728
00:40:47,448 --> 00:40:50,510
And this loop probably looks familiar to you,

729
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:54,413
because it's essentially the business model of games

730
00:40:54,473 --> 00:40:56,875
as a service, or life services, or free-to-play,

731
00:40:56,935 --> 00:40:57,876
freemium subscription.

732
00:40:58,136 --> 00:41:00,958
Whatever you call it, it's essentially the same.

733
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:06,181
But we're not a game as a service.

734
00:41:06,441 --> 00:41:08,222
Subnautica is a premium game.

735
00:41:08,282 --> 00:41:10,985
Single player, pay once, upfront, we

736
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:11,845
already got your money.

737
00:41:12,966 --> 00:41:15,168
What I'm saying is that with open development, you can

738
00:41:15,308 --> 00:41:17,250
basically get the same kind of loop.

739
00:41:18,051 --> 00:41:20,573
And therefore, I'm going to call it game development as a

740
00:41:20,633 --> 00:41:21,013
service.

741
00:41:22,394 --> 00:41:28,480
And it works because early access is a show.

742
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:31,437
Gamers want entertainment.

743
00:41:31,497 --> 00:41:33,499
They don't necessarily want to play games.

744
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:36,781
Games are entertainment, but they want entertainment.

745
00:41:36,901 --> 00:41:40,284
And watching and influencing a game getting made,

746
00:41:40,725 --> 00:41:42,766
that is also entertainment.

747
00:41:43,407 --> 00:41:45,168
And we are in the entertainment business here,

748
00:41:45,608 --> 00:41:46,589
or at least most of us.

749
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,672
So with open development, you kind of

750
00:41:49,692 --> 00:41:51,093
get like double the entertainment.

751
00:41:51,113 --> 00:41:53,154
You get the entertainment of making the game,

752
00:41:53,174 --> 00:41:54,896
and then you get the entertainment which is

753
00:41:54,956 --> 00:41:56,177
the game, the final product.

754
00:41:57,595 --> 00:42:00,976
And that should come to no surprise that that's a thing.

755
00:42:01,016 --> 00:42:04,018
Like other industries have discovered this long time ago.

756
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:09,200
Like take open kitchens where you can see the chef working

757
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,461
on your food while you're waiting.

758
00:42:12,182 --> 00:42:13,122
That's entertainment.

759
00:42:13,803 --> 00:42:16,844
It makes the time feel shorter.

760
00:42:17,224 --> 00:42:18,745
But it also builds trust.

761
00:42:19,785 --> 00:42:21,666
He cannot mess up with you seeing it.

762
00:42:22,787 --> 00:42:25,028
And that's crucially important on early access.

763
00:42:25,088 --> 00:42:25,948
You want trust.

764
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,721
Because you want money, right?

765
00:42:29,761 --> 00:42:30,462
You want buy-in.

766
00:42:30,742 --> 00:42:35,368
So if you do that, if you do open development, you don't

767
00:42:35,468 --> 00:42:37,351
even need to do marketing anymore.

768
00:42:40,114 --> 00:42:42,397
These days, your most powerful tools are

769
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:44,360
streamers and influencers.

770
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:47,063
And then maybe the Steam front page.

771
00:42:48,287 --> 00:42:52,973
and then social media and eventually there's still press.

772
00:42:53,593 --> 00:42:56,857
But probably word of mouth really,

773
00:42:57,318 --> 00:43:01,182
because what really happens here is that on an India scale

774
00:43:01,222 --> 00:43:03,004
there is an infinite market for sure.

775
00:43:05,307 --> 00:43:08,010
But that market is highly fragmented.

776
00:43:08,841 --> 00:43:16,203
into clusters and you can absolutely, you can easily exhaust a cluster, even at an indie scale.

777
00:43:16,723 --> 00:43:21,825
Like we probably sold to every single person who ever watched Jacksepticeye because he just

778
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:26,826
made so many videos about it, right? So that cluster is exhausted, but we still can get

779
00:43:26,886 --> 00:43:31,028
millions and millions of other people who never, who don't even know who Jacksepticeye is.

780
00:43:31,994 --> 00:43:38,669
So what you want to do is to get into as many clusters as possible and then let the cluster

781
00:43:38,709 --> 00:43:39,310
do its thing.

782
00:43:39,731 --> 00:43:42,658
And that's probably word of mouth and that takes a long time.

783
00:43:44,863 --> 00:43:46,324
Okay, summary, let's wrap it up.

784
00:43:47,664 --> 00:43:50,986
Our three things that we think are important

785
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:54,088
and that really we learned during the development

786
00:43:54,128 --> 00:43:56,149
of Subnautica was, okay, first of all,

787
00:43:57,209 --> 00:43:58,710
we designed for emotions, right?

788
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:02,572
And because we believe that that is the core thing

789
00:44:02,592 --> 00:44:03,813
that engages your players.

790
00:44:04,853 --> 00:44:05,093
And then,

791
00:44:06,653 --> 00:44:08,635
Second, streamers are your salespeople.

792
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:13,041
So you want to make games that are not only nice to play, but

793
00:44:13,081 --> 00:44:13,982
also nice to watch.

794
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,124
And you want to treat streamers well.

795
00:44:17,566 --> 00:44:22,672
And thirdly, early access is a show, and open development is

796
00:44:22,773 --> 00:44:23,894
what produces the show.

797
00:44:26,324 --> 00:44:29,405
And when you want to build great original games,

798
00:44:29,705 --> 00:44:33,326
we recommend the way we do it is build prototypes.

799
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,647
You define your spikes.

800
00:44:36,887 --> 00:44:39,508
Make sure you know what this game is about, what stands out.

801
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:41,829
Build your minimum viable product.

802
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:47,011
And then you get real user feedback as early and as often

803
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:47,631
as possible.

804
00:44:48,632 --> 00:44:49,432
You iterate on that.

805
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:54,283
And it's still true that execution really matters.

806
00:44:54,423 --> 00:44:55,524
Ideas, not so much.

807
00:44:55,724 --> 00:44:57,185
Execution is what it comes down to,

808
00:44:57,245 --> 00:44:58,806
which is why iteration is so important.

809
00:45:01,348 --> 00:45:04,630
So what we would recommend is to design for emotions first,

810
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:06,591
and then listen to your game.

811
00:45:06,931 --> 00:45:09,793
Listen what it wants to tell you, adapt to that.

812
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:12,115
It's probably not what you had planned.

813
00:45:13,095 --> 00:45:15,117
It's better than what you had planned,

814
00:45:15,177 --> 00:45:19,620
and you have to let go and allow for it to happen.

815
00:45:20,914 --> 00:45:23,415
and listen to your players and deliver what they want.

816
00:45:24,175 --> 00:45:27,677
Unless, of course, people are always asking us,

817
00:45:28,557 --> 00:45:31,078
I want a harpoon, I want guns, I want to fight back.

818
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:34,340
That fundamentally clashes with our vision of the game

819
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,321
and would probably ruin the horror aspect of the game.

820
00:45:38,381 --> 00:45:40,182
So if it clashes with your vision,

821
00:45:40,222 --> 00:45:41,843
then of course listen to your instincts.

822
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:48,533
And like I said before, Subnautica had a really, really rough start.

823
00:45:48,553 --> 00:45:50,935
We always went out of business there.

824
00:45:51,435 --> 00:45:53,997
It becomes successful over a long, long period of time.

825
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:59,442
And they say that it takes 20 years to become an overnight success.

826
00:46:00,062 --> 00:46:01,663
That was certainly true for us.

827
00:46:02,204 --> 00:46:05,566
And the corollary of that is if you put all your eggs in one basket

828
00:46:05,607 --> 00:46:08,229
and you try to hit that launch date and you make a big splash

829
00:46:08,289 --> 00:46:10,991
and you have all the press covering it and stuff like that,

830
00:46:12,492 --> 00:46:13,173
that might not work.

831
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:19,895
People might be busy that very day and you don't you don't allow for word of mouth to spread

832
00:46:20,855 --> 00:46:23,277
Hey, we believe in being open

833
00:46:24,558 --> 00:46:29,341
As open as possible and building communities around the games we are building and the company

834
00:46:31,801 --> 00:46:34,824
I'm very, very certain that early access is a show.

835
00:46:35,765 --> 00:46:38,427
And of course, there's always a lot of negativity

836
00:46:38,567 --> 00:46:41,429
and backlash and people writing really bad things about you.

837
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:43,230
You cannot do anything about that

838
00:46:43,271 --> 00:46:44,952
and you cannot defend yourself

839
00:46:45,072 --> 00:46:46,353
because that just looks ugly.

840
00:46:46,453 --> 00:46:49,395
So you will need a community to support you

841
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:55,680
and defend you for you, basically.

842
00:46:57,163 --> 00:47:01,251
And most important perhaps, just ship, ship, ship, ship.

843
00:47:02,413 --> 00:47:03,034
Read his stuff.

844
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,378
That's my talk, thank you very much.

845
00:47:18,942 --> 00:47:19,202
Thank you.

846
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:21,464
So this is the link to the slides again.

847
00:47:21,484 --> 00:47:24,546
You should be able to point your camera at it, or you just

848
00:47:24,846 --> 00:47:25,787
go to my Twitter.

849
00:47:26,347 --> 00:47:28,309
It's pinned there if you want to have the slides.

850
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:33,933
My boss asked me to say that we are hiring, so now you know.

851
00:47:35,995 --> 00:47:38,917
And I believe that we have time for a Q&A.

852
00:47:40,777 --> 00:47:45,364
I shall remind you that there's also the feedback form that I

853
00:47:45,405 --> 00:47:47,548
would like you to fill out, because I want to hear what

854
00:47:47,568 --> 00:47:49,311
you are thinking about my talk.

855
00:47:49,391 --> 00:47:50,673
I want to get real user feedback.

856
00:47:53,045 --> 00:47:58,147
And if you would like to have me go deeper into any of these topics, please come to the

857
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,788
microphones, I'm happy to do so.

858
00:48:01,488 --> 00:48:06,450
If we run out of time with the Q&A, I will go to the wrap-up area, which is like just

859
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,112
around there near the windows, and we'll follow up there.

860
00:48:10,492 --> 00:48:11,252
Okay.

861
00:48:11,272 --> 00:48:12,413
So let's start with Q&A.

862
00:48:13,793 --> 00:48:14,633
Yeah, hi.

863
00:48:15,154 --> 00:48:15,694
Great talk.

864
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,122
We made We Happy Few, we also did open development,

865
00:48:21,162 --> 00:48:23,324
we discovered many of the same things you did,

866
00:48:23,384 --> 00:48:25,946
which we started doing a small roguelike game

867
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,928
and we ended up doing a big adventure game,

868
00:48:28,589 --> 00:48:30,951
and permadeath went out the window,

869
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:32,332
and a whole bunch of different things changed.

870
00:48:32,352 --> 00:48:33,513
So that was excellent.

871
00:48:34,234 --> 00:48:36,296
But one of the things that we did discover is

872
00:48:37,357 --> 00:48:40,060
there was a tendency to build towards the next build,

873
00:48:40,801 --> 00:48:42,102
and not all features...

874
00:48:43,412 --> 00:48:44,734
can be done in a month.

875
00:48:45,434 --> 00:48:52,662
So after a while we were beginning to feel that all of the developers were so focused

876
00:48:52,902 --> 00:48:56,005
on the next build that they weren't doing the long-term things.

877
00:48:56,065 --> 00:48:58,188
Did you have that same experience and what did you do about it?

878
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:03,433
So the question was, if you release monthly updates, how

879
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:06,595
do you do long-term stuff that takes more than a month?

880
00:49:07,916 --> 00:49:08,897
Yes, absolutely.

881
00:49:08,957 --> 00:49:10,918
We had that very, very much.

882
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:16,242
And we kind of handled that by splitting

883
00:49:16,282 --> 00:49:17,182
the team a little bit.

884
00:49:17,623 --> 00:49:21,045
Some things, if they just take longer, they have to be

885
00:49:21,085 --> 00:49:22,006
developed on a branch.

886
00:49:24,422 --> 00:49:27,103
So our big one was the H2O update,

887
00:49:27,143 --> 00:49:28,923
which where we were like rewriting

888
00:49:29,784 --> 00:49:31,824
the entire shading for the water.

889
00:49:32,645 --> 00:49:35,346
And that was a big one and took like four or five months

890
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:35,886
or something.

891
00:49:35,946 --> 00:49:38,107
So that was all kind of like in peril

892
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:39,607
and that was a huge pain.

893
00:49:43,716 --> 00:49:47,637
And I absolutely agree that it's hard to both ship

894
00:49:47,657 --> 00:49:50,978
great updates short-term and do the right thing long-term.

895
00:49:51,678 --> 00:49:54,099
But at the same time, I kind of want

896
00:49:54,139 --> 00:49:57,959
to say that you might actually run out of business

897
00:49:58,019 --> 00:49:59,580
if you don't do the short-term things.

898
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:03,881
So if it keeps you going, and if it

899
00:50:03,921 --> 00:50:08,882
keeps getting the money in, then maybe that's

900
00:50:08,962 --> 00:50:11,443
already good enough or something.

901
00:50:13,164 --> 00:50:14,585
I don't have a good solution for that.

902
00:50:14,965 --> 00:50:17,046
I only know that if you don't ship an update,

903
00:50:18,567 --> 00:50:20,288
the long tail goes way down.

904
00:50:20,688 --> 00:50:25,251
And people start screaming, they abandoned the product.

905
00:50:26,011 --> 00:50:26,612
We had that, too.

906
00:50:26,812 --> 00:50:27,052
Yeah.

907
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:29,714
So at least ship something.

908
00:50:29,834 --> 00:50:30,934
It doesn't have to be like.

909
00:50:32,204 --> 00:50:36,048
the magnum opus, but definitely keep shipping and try to keep

910
00:50:36,088 --> 00:50:38,930
that long-term thing still on the back burner.

911
00:50:39,391 --> 00:50:41,452
And eventually, when it's ready, then you come out and

912
00:50:41,532 --> 00:50:43,054
you're like, yeah, here, look at this.

913
00:50:44,635 --> 00:50:46,557
You don't tell anyone that it took longer than a month.

914
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:48,479
Thank you.

915
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:49,079
Great question.

916
00:50:50,352 --> 00:50:54,297
So I first came across Subnautica when my son was in the hospital.

917
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:59,203
You made the game available for free to children's hospitals.

918
00:50:59,944 --> 00:51:03,488
They have steam machines and the kids can play them.

919
00:51:03,629 --> 00:51:04,950
So first of all, thank you.

920
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:07,834
That helped us get through a very painful period.

921
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:12,101
We ended up buying, we had never heard of it before.

922
00:51:12,201 --> 00:51:16,186
We ended up buying two and then my son's friends

923
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:17,467
bought like five or six.

924
00:51:17,628 --> 00:51:21,392
Is there a way you can track those analytics?

925
00:51:21,492 --> 00:51:24,536
I assume the hospital doesn't let you do it.

926
00:51:24,556 --> 00:51:27,960
Do you figure that out in your strategy or what?

927
00:51:28,405 --> 00:51:33,249
Right, OK, so the question, I guess, is what do we see in our

928
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:34,830
analytics and what do we not see?

929
00:51:37,212 --> 00:51:40,334
The short answer to that is we have no idea who's

930
00:51:40,354 --> 00:51:41,055
playing our game.

931
00:51:41,415 --> 00:51:42,696
We don't know how old they are.

932
00:51:43,096 --> 00:51:46,859
We don't know where they, well, OK, we do know the

933
00:51:46,899 --> 00:51:50,181
country, but we don't even care.

934
00:51:53,457 --> 00:51:57,081
there's no, we don't optimize for a certain target audience or something.

935
00:51:57,121 --> 00:52:00,746
We optimize for the, the, uh,

936
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:04,690
the global trends of feedback tickets that we see and the complaints that we

937
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:07,974
get. And, and they are pretty much the same all across age groups.

938
00:52:08,254 --> 00:52:09,396
What we did do though,

939
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:14,221
is try to make this game as inclusive as possible and to be, uh,

940
00:52:15,474 --> 00:52:16,354
uh... reaching

941
00:52:17,575 --> 00:52:20,318
to not put stuff in there that would give us a

942
00:52:21,118 --> 00:52:24,401
uh... okay you can only play this game when you're sixteen or older rating right

943
00:52:24,481 --> 00:52:24,761
so we

944
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:28,124
we did try to make it as kid friendly as possible because

945
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:32,088
we just thought that that's a good thing

946
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:38,013
uh... and i didn't even know that hospitals get it for free so thank you for

947
00:52:38,053 --> 00:52:38,653
bringing that up

948
00:52:38,673 --> 00:52:39,874
it was interesting

949
00:52:42,982 --> 00:52:48,547
You said that you got a lot of benefit out of telemetry and out of listening to your community.

950
00:52:49,528 --> 00:52:50,909
You had a team of 25 you said.

951
00:52:52,030 --> 00:53:01,939
How many people were dedicated to analyzing heat maps coming processing all those spreadsheets and also with community outreach like what was the the cost of that.

952
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,481
Yeah that was me.

953
00:53:10,368 --> 00:53:11,029
It was tough.

954
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:14,609
I mean, I had to wear many hats, and one of them was that.

955
00:53:14,689 --> 00:53:18,030
We could absolutely have had more people just

956
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:20,030
on the analytics side of things.

957
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:24,031
But at least what we got out of it

958
00:53:24,091 --> 00:53:28,492
was we were able to cut short a bunch of really long meetings

959
00:53:28,552 --> 00:53:31,352
that just went in circles where we were speculating

960
00:53:31,412 --> 00:53:32,092
about stuff, right?

961
00:53:32,472 --> 00:53:35,353
We were like, hey, do people build a CMOS first,

962
00:53:35,473 --> 00:53:36,893
or do they build a base first?

963
00:53:36,993 --> 00:53:38,713
And then what does that mean, right?

964
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:39,253
And I could just.

965
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:45,806
pull up the data and run a query and say, hey, OK, yeah,

966
00:53:45,886 --> 00:53:47,267
they actually built this email first.

967
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,708
This is what happens in the game, right?

968
00:53:49,188 --> 00:53:54,812
And so that helped just cutting down our meeting times.

969
00:53:54,872 --> 00:53:55,573
We didn't like pru.

970
00:53:57,135 --> 00:54:00,957
We used it as an encyclopedia more than like a proactive,

971
00:54:01,017 --> 00:54:03,718
like data-driven development or something.

972
00:54:04,198 --> 00:54:05,078
We didn't do that, yeah.

973
00:54:05,619 --> 00:54:08,300
But we used it to balance the game

974
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:09,680
whenever we had a question.

975
00:54:10,621 --> 00:54:11,501
It was in the data.

976
00:54:12,302 --> 00:54:14,383
That's what we got out of it.

977
00:54:14,743 --> 00:54:16,884
Is that for community as well as telemetry,

978
00:54:17,064 --> 00:54:19,105
or did you also have someone dedicated to community?

979
00:54:20,853 --> 00:54:23,375
The feedback tickets that we get from the game?

980
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:25,155
Oh, OK.

981
00:54:25,196 --> 00:54:28,717
So the feedback tickets, we process them automatically.

982
00:54:28,757 --> 00:54:31,579
You should go to the website.

983
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,260
It's text, right?

984
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:38,543
So we have text analyzers that look at word frequencies and

985
00:54:38,623 --> 00:54:42,865
bigrams, and they try to figure out by

986
00:54:43,885 --> 00:54:47,706
By looking at these words, we can figure out, OK, there are

987
00:54:47,766 --> 00:54:49,126
certain trends that are appearing.

988
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:52,407
For example, the word stuck is coming up a lot recently.

989
00:54:52,507 --> 00:54:55,528
So we look at the tickets, and we're like, oh, look at that.

990
00:54:55,568 --> 00:54:56,528
There's a correlation.

991
00:54:56,548 --> 00:54:57,808
They're all stuck in this area.

992
00:54:58,068 --> 00:54:59,249
And so we can fix that.

993
00:54:59,549 --> 00:55:00,589
That's kind of how it works.

994
00:55:01,049 --> 00:55:05,450
We get a lot of feedback ticket per minute.

995
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:07,770
So there's no way you can just read them.

996
00:55:08,751 --> 00:55:13,372
We analyze them with an algorithm.

997
00:55:14,332 --> 00:55:14,653
Thank you.

998
00:55:15,214 --> 00:55:15,614
You're welcome.

999
00:55:17,097 --> 00:55:19,801
At what point was your game when you launched it Early

1000
00:55:19,861 --> 00:55:20,983
Access on your website?

1001
00:55:21,184 --> 00:55:24,128
And then what point when you went into Steam Early Access?

1002
00:55:24,168 --> 00:55:24,669
And did you see?

1003
00:55:26,326 --> 00:55:28,828
like how finished it was, did that,

1004
00:55:30,129 --> 00:55:31,450
like your graph kept going up and up,

1005
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:33,452
do you think that was just word of mouth,

1006
00:55:33,612 --> 00:55:36,495
or was that your game getting better as well, I guess?

1007
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:40,538
Um, so the question was what state was the game in

1008
00:55:41,259 --> 00:55:43,421
in earliest access, and then later,

1009
00:55:43,581 --> 00:55:46,503
what was it in when we were in early access?

1010
00:55:47,384 --> 00:55:50,427
So, we only had two months between those two.

1011
00:55:51,425 --> 00:55:54,628
Because we thought we'd put it out on early access,

1012
00:55:54,648 --> 00:55:56,550
and we'd get a huge amount of money.

1013
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:57,130
And we didn't.

1014
00:55:57,751 --> 00:56:01,674
So we really had to put it on early access and be out there.

1015
00:56:02,054 --> 00:56:04,156
And then we thought, hey, we will get a huge amount of money,

1016
00:56:04,216 --> 00:56:06,378
and we didn't.

1017
00:56:06,998 --> 00:56:10,141
So the game was still in a relatively similar state.

1018
00:56:10,161 --> 00:56:14,404
I think it was a combination of things, really.

1019
00:56:14,965 --> 00:56:17,727
There was a core there that was already interesting.

1020
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:22,591
But as soon as people realized that we are one of those games

1021
00:56:22,651 --> 00:56:24,973
that actually do care about early access,

1022
00:56:25,033 --> 00:56:27,856
and actually do ship updates, and actually do

1023
00:56:27,956 --> 00:56:30,298
listen to the community, that's when things really

1024
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:31,259
started to snowball.

1025
00:56:31,339 --> 00:56:36,543
So I would say that it takes about six months from going out

1026
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:39,146
there to being recognized as a good player

1027
00:56:39,686 --> 00:56:41,287
in the field of early access.

1028
00:56:41,888 --> 00:56:44,190
And once people realize that, then it's all good,

1029
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:44,890
and it snowballs.

1030
00:56:45,211 --> 00:56:45,331
Yes?

1031
00:56:46,261 --> 00:56:48,042
Thank you for a brilliant talk, first of all.

1032
00:56:48,062 --> 00:56:51,085
It was very insightful, inspiring, and funny too.

1033
00:56:52,346 --> 00:56:54,968
You said you originally set out to build a game in six months.

1034
00:56:56,209 --> 00:56:58,010
When did you discover that you needed longer than that?

1035
00:56:58,171 --> 00:57:00,192
And did you have any trouble motivating the team?

1036
00:57:00,252 --> 00:57:01,193
Because you're all remote.

1037
00:57:02,214 --> 00:57:04,296
Oh, motivation I don't think was a problem.

1038
00:57:05,577 --> 00:57:06,698
Scope was a problem, right?

1039
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,463
I think that's, when did we realize that?

1040
00:57:13,976 --> 00:57:14,777
I have no idea.

1041
00:57:14,857 --> 00:57:18,580
We are really bad at realizing how far we are behind schedule.

1042
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,141
Because we don't have a producer.

1043
00:57:20,601 --> 00:57:21,942
We don't have a product manager.

1044
00:57:22,543 --> 00:57:24,624
We just do our thing.

1045
00:57:24,925 --> 00:57:28,547
So we have a gut feeling, and we're always wrong.

1046
00:57:30,449 --> 00:57:34,332
So I think that was just us being really naive

1047
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:35,573
or something in a way.

1048
00:57:38,015 --> 00:57:39,636
Like looking back at that, I don't even

1049
00:57:39,676 --> 00:57:41,337
know what we can do in half a year.

1050
00:57:42,498 --> 00:57:45,342
for the way our company works would be very, very little.

1051
00:57:46,103 --> 00:57:48,307
So yeah, it's just not the way we work.

1052
00:57:48,407 --> 00:57:51,071
Maybe it's the remoteness of our team or something.

1053
00:57:51,111 --> 00:57:51,452
I don't know.

1054
00:57:52,433 --> 00:57:53,034
Yeah.

1055
00:57:53,455 --> 00:57:54,777
Time is not our friend.

1056
00:57:54,797 --> 00:57:56,239
Thank you.

1057
00:57:57,401 --> 00:57:57,441
Hi.

1058
00:57:58,305 --> 00:58:01,225
It was very encouraging to hear your experience with early access

1059
00:58:02,405 --> 00:58:04,006
what I hear from

1060
00:58:05,186 --> 00:58:10,787
People who have like negative experiences with early access they talk about like the source of controversies being

1061
00:58:11,407 --> 00:58:18,748
Devs like taking something away that wasn't working out or like adding a new feature that really changes the game and you know

1062
00:58:19,108 --> 00:58:26,130
Kills it to quote the forums. Did you have any experiences with this with so long and early access with like fan backlash or

1063
00:58:27,308 --> 00:58:30,069
Did you keep things in the beta branch until you were sure they were ready to go in?

1064
00:58:30,529 --> 00:58:36,132
Right. So the question was about backlash or things that went wrong during early access.

1065
00:58:37,072 --> 00:58:38,793
Yes, we had all these things, right?

1066
00:58:38,913 --> 00:58:44,596
Like when we first came out, we were not sure whether that would be multiplayer or not.

1067
00:58:45,279 --> 00:58:48,600
And I'm sure that there were a lot of people who bought it

1068
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,961
under the assumption that there would eventually be multiplayer.

1069
00:58:53,681 --> 00:58:56,242
And so eventually we realized, OK, there's

1070
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,462
not going to be multiplayer.

1071
00:58:57,502 --> 00:59:01,483
We had to be super upfront about that and say, look guys,

1072
00:59:02,824 --> 00:59:03,724
it's not going to happen.

1073
00:59:05,724 --> 00:59:06,564
And yes, people got.

1074
00:59:07,972 --> 00:59:15,875
angry with that, for sure. And there were also things where we changed the game significantly.

1075
00:59:15,895 --> 00:59:23,159
I'm not sure if we had a lot of feedback on that, but the Cyclops used to be so that it

1076
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:28,101
would flood, and then eventually that broke and we never fixed it. We put something else

1077
00:59:28,161 --> 00:59:32,263
in there instead. The point is that...

1078
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:37,553
You want to keep your creative freedom and you want to do what is best for the game.

1079
00:59:37,593 --> 00:59:41,795
And I think if you communicate that correctly, people will understand.

1080
00:59:41,855 --> 00:59:45,237
But like, good community management is so difficult.

1081
00:59:45,277 --> 00:59:48,579
You really need to have a dedicated person and that person has to be a wizard.

1082
00:59:48,959 --> 00:59:51,241
And we just happen to have that kind of person.

1083
00:59:52,511 --> 00:59:56,735
And that's the other 50% of our success, I would claim.

1084
00:59:58,037 --> 01:00:00,179
Because you always need to have the community to defend

1085
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:03,042
yourself against any kind of nonsense backlash that is

1086
01:00:03,082 --> 01:00:04,063
coming up all the time.

1087
01:00:04,504 --> 01:00:04,964
Good question.

1088
01:00:05,304 --> 01:00:05,585
Thank you.

1089
01:00:06,005 --> 01:00:07,887
I think we have one more minute, maybe.

1090
01:00:08,962 --> 01:00:19,010
Hi. Do you think using early access as your primary model would be effective for all types of genres,

1091
01:00:19,091 --> 01:00:25,376
or do you think it's limited to only certain types of game experiences like Subnautica?

1092
01:00:25,576 --> 01:00:30,780
Right. Great question. So the question is, is early access applicable to all kinds of games, all kinds of genres?

1093
01:00:31,577 --> 01:00:36,962
And I whenever I give this talk people tell me oh, we're building a story based game

1094
01:00:37,002 --> 01:00:41,846
And like and if I put that on early access then the story is spoiled right and then then the game is ruined

1095
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:45,849
And I kind of agree but

1096
01:00:47,207 --> 01:00:51,610
Let's just say we're building a follow-up game, and it's a story-based game.

1097
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:54,692
It's below zero, and we are putting it on early access.

1098
01:00:54,852 --> 01:00:55,632
We're doing it again.

1099
01:00:55,852 --> 01:00:59,715
So I think there are ways around that.

1100
01:01:00,535 --> 01:01:01,196
And for sure...

1101
01:01:02,085 --> 01:01:03,986
We were really lucky with Subnautica,

1102
01:01:04,006 --> 01:01:05,867
because it's like open world sandbox, right?

1103
01:01:05,907 --> 01:01:09,050
Which is like the perfect thing for early access.

1104
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:11,591
Couldn't be any better.

1105
01:01:11,812 --> 01:01:17,015
But I truly believe that if you want to,

1106
01:01:17,255 --> 01:01:19,997
and if you structure your game making process around it,

1107
01:01:20,478 --> 01:01:23,920
you can absolutely do it for any kind of genre.

1108
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,922
And you will end up with a game that is better than you.

1109
01:01:27,463 --> 01:01:28,864
could make behind closed doors.

1110
01:01:29,004 --> 01:01:31,628
That's my claim, and I'm very happy,

1111
01:01:31,828 --> 01:01:35,132
very welcome to have a discussion about that

1112
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:37,855
if anyone wants to fight with me a little bit.

1113
01:01:39,317 --> 01:01:39,617
Thank you.

1114
01:01:40,078 --> 01:01:40,378
Thank you.

1115
01:01:40,618 --> 01:01:41,560
Okay, I think that's it.

1116
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:42,561
Thank you so much.
