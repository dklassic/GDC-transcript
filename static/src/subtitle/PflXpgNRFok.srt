00:00:05,999 --> 00:00:08,260
Hello folks, welcome to GDC 2021.

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,621
This is a live fireside chat,

3
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:12,242
Gina Davis and Mithu Khandaker

4
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:15,344
on masculinity and video games in the gaming community.

5
00:00:15,344 --> 00:00:18,265
I'm Joel Couture, editor-in-chief of Indie Games Plus.

6
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:19,166
My pronouns are he, him,

7
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:22,187
and I'll be the moderator for this session.

8
00:00:22,187 --> 00:00:23,868
Now I'd like to pass things over to Gina

9
00:00:23,868 --> 00:00:25,108
so she can introduce herself,

10
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,990
in case you somehow need an introduction for her

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,011
and her tremendous amount of work

12
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:32,712
in all kinds of media industries.

13
00:00:32,712 --> 00:00:33,993
So Gina, please take it away.

14
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,411
Oh, thank you so much.

15
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,513
Thanks for that.

16
00:00:38,513 --> 00:00:41,415
And thanks for everybody for being here.

17
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:47,200
I'm very excited to be a part of this today and very

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,042
excited to get going and talk about this, this topic

19
00:00:50,042 --> 00:00:53,525
that we've done a very extensive

20
00:00:53,525 --> 00:00:54,826
study about.

21
00:00:54,826 --> 00:00:58,029
And so, yeah, looking forward to all of this.

22
00:01:00,488 --> 00:01:01,969
All right, and next we have Mitu.

23
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:03,309
Could you say a few words

24
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:05,250
about your own impressive body of work?

25
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,291
Because you're pretty impressive as well.

26
00:01:08,291 --> 00:01:09,912
Thanks, Joel.

27
00:01:09,912 --> 00:01:11,752
Yeah, just really honored to be here.

28
00:01:11,752 --> 00:01:14,053
So hi, I'm Dr. Mitu Kandeka.

29
00:01:14,053 --> 00:01:16,334
I'm a game designer and engineer.

30
00:01:16,334 --> 00:01:18,415
So I'm a professor at NYU Game Center,

31
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:21,736
and I'm also CEO at Glow Up Games,

32
00:01:21,736 --> 00:01:24,937
which is a diverse mobile game studio.

33
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:30,922
And I've been in the games industry for around 14 years now, so I've been coming to GDC for about

34
00:01:30,922 --> 00:01:37,428
that long as well, so really thrilled to be here to welcome Gina to her first GDC. So I've been

35
00:01:37,428 --> 00:01:44,054
lucky as well to be on the advisory committee for GDC for the last six years or so on the advocacy

36
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:47,497
side, so I'm here to represent the game developers' perspective.

37
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:54,468
Well, it's great to have you both here. I'm just going to jump right in with some questions. So

38
00:01:54,468 --> 00:01:58,495
let's talk about this study. Can you tell us a bit about the study and how everything worked, Gina?

39
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,481
Yes, absolutely.

40
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:08,063
We we looked at both the games themselves and also

41
00:02:08,063 --> 00:02:12,985
the the players that that people watch play

42
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:16,106
and took a survey also to find out people's

43
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:19,308
impressions and and ideas about it.

44
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:23,469
So this is a very, very extensive study, and we believe more extensive

45
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:28,491
than any that's been done previously on on gaming and what messages it sends.

46
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:35,259
Okay, what sort of specifics were you looking for in the study?

47
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:40,570
Like what did you were you hoping to find from watching what people watch play?

48
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:45,907
Well, we wanted to find out we wanted to find out what,

49
00:02:45,907 --> 00:02:49,770
like I said, what message the the games are sending and

50
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,254
and found particularly strong results

51
00:02:54,254 --> 00:02:58,317
in what the male characters represent

52
00:02:58,317 --> 00:03:03,962
and the the the impact of violence

53
00:03:03,962 --> 00:03:07,245
and hyper masculinity in

54
00:03:07,245 --> 00:03:10,588
in these in these games that are that are being played.

55
00:03:10,948 --> 00:03:16,092
and trying to see what kind of impact that has and how it can maybe be improved moving forward.

56
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:23,677
The study indicates that many elements of the gaming ecosystem reinforce something called

57
00:03:23,677 --> 00:03:29,661
the man box. Can you tell us a little bit about what this man box entails? Because that was a

58
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:33,564
learning experience for me because I'd never heard this subject before.

59
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:34,703
about. Right.

60
00:03:34,703 --> 00:03:36,523
Tell us how video games connect to it

61
00:03:36,523 --> 00:03:37,504
on many different levels.

62
00:03:37,504 --> 00:03:39,925
And how is this building a very specific vision

63
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:41,845
of the world and what is acceptable behavior

64
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:44,867
through interacting with the medium of games?

65
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:46,087
So that was a mouthful.

66
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:46,907
Right, right.

67
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:50,929
So the MANBOX is the seven pillars of the MANBOX

68
00:03:50,929 --> 00:03:55,131
is a concept that was developed by our partners at Promundo.

69
00:03:55,131 --> 00:03:58,052
And it refers to a set of beliefs that are communicated

70
00:03:58,052 --> 00:04:00,833
by parents and family and the media and peers.

71
00:04:01,293 --> 00:04:05,016
and other members of society that place pressures

72
00:04:05,016 --> 00:04:07,518
on men and boys to be a certain way.

73
00:04:07,518 --> 00:04:10,181
And these pressures include telling men

74
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:12,663
to be self-sufficient, to act tough,

75
00:04:12,663 --> 00:04:14,564
to be physically attractive,

76
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:17,187
to stick to very rigid gender roles,

77
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:21,210
to be heterosexual, to have sexual prowess,

78
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:25,273
and to use aggression to resolve conflicts.

79
00:04:25,273 --> 00:04:27,215
And we found in our study that

80
00:04:27,695 --> 00:04:33,401
masculine norms are very strongly upheld with four and five male characters displaying at least

81
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:40,508
one of these pillars of masculinity. For example, seven to ten male characters are shown engaging

82
00:04:40,508 --> 00:04:43,911
in stereotypically masculine activities like

83
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:46,633
taking risks, engaging in violence, getting angry.

84
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:51,334
Nearly one in four male characters actually express anger.

85
00:04:51,334 --> 00:04:55,116
And violence is also a major component of this man box.

86
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:58,897
Sixty three percent of male characters

87
00:04:58,897 --> 00:05:01,658
enact violence in the in the in the games.

88
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:05,660
And 84 percent of that time, the violence is directed against other people.

89
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,982
And the leading motive for violence from male characters is personal gain compared to the small

90
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:17,924
proportion of characters who are perpetrating violence for a more noble motivation, protecting

91
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:26,346
a stranger or protecting society. It kind of alters like your players, the game players'

92
00:05:26,346 --> 00:05:31,148
visions on kind of what reality is or what is acceptable behavior through their kind of

93
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:32,508
interactions with these games.

94
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:39,197
Right, yes, hyper exposure to to these kinds of tropes is is

95
00:05:39,197 --> 00:05:43,180
very impactful and will definitely you know what we what

96
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,064
we're exposed to over and over becomes a sort of reality for us

97
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:48,264
and

98
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:56,953
media and games and the things that we see in our popular culture have a tremendous impact on

99
00:05:56,953 --> 00:06:02,735
shaping who we are. So as you can imagine, watching, playing these games over and over

100
00:06:02,735 --> 00:06:07,916
or watching people play these games can have a significant impact about what you think is

101
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:14,359
is the actual way that men should be or what masculinity should look like.

102
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:17,820
Yeah, exactly. Seeing these kind of reinforce

103
00:06:18,163 --> 00:06:21,445
from like hearing what the boys hangouts

104
00:06:21,445 --> 00:06:23,145
or seeing the reinforce in the games they're playing

105
00:06:23,145 --> 00:06:26,446
can kind of feed into, this is right, this is real.

106
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:28,647
This is how people talk and act to each other.

107
00:06:28,647 --> 00:06:29,327
Right, right.

108
00:06:29,327 --> 00:06:29,767
That's your point.

109
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:31,568
Mitsu, I'm gonna bug you.

110
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:34,829
Can you suggest some ways, no matter how small,

111
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:37,910
to kind of break away from these man box elements

112
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,310
in game development,

113
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,271
or how developers can kind of steer away from that?

114
00:06:41,774 --> 00:06:45,617
Yeah, I mean, I think firstly to speak to that, like this was the first time I was lucky enough

115
00:06:45,617 --> 00:06:51,741
to sort of get a peek at the study ahead of time. And I think firstly to speak to the man box,

116
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:57,866
like I think the thing I love about that definition is the way that it talks about how

117
00:06:57,866 --> 00:07:04,371
it is limiting, right, for both cis men and folks of all genders, right? So,

118
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:07,493
like the ways in which these representations kind of box people in.

119
00:07:08,514 --> 00:07:10,317
in certain ways.

120
00:07:10,317 --> 00:07:11,859
And I think the other thing as well,

121
00:07:11,859 --> 00:07:13,522
before I sort of get to your question directly,

122
00:07:13,522 --> 00:07:16,246
is that I love about the study,

123
00:07:16,246 --> 00:07:17,768
is that it is very intersectional

124
00:07:17,768 --> 00:07:19,330
and that's something I care a lot about.

125
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,677
So there's a lot of, in addition to sort of looking at...

126
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,098
gender representation.

127
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:29,440
It's also sort of, you know, there's some groundbreaking

128
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,981
sort of new findings through the content analysis

129
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:36,743
to do with race representation, to do with queer representation

130
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:39,704
and like looking across all of these different intersecting axes,

131
00:07:39,704 --> 00:07:43,046
which is a really important perspective to take.

132
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,467
And so and those are sort of all things

133
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:48,708
that we should be thinking of kind of together as game developers like.

134
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:52,773
you know, taking this very intersectional approach.

135
00:07:52,773 --> 00:07:55,737
I think, you know, to speak to sort of ways

136
00:07:55,737 --> 00:08:00,644
that we can intervene in these kinds of representations,

137
00:08:00,644 --> 00:08:02,266
I think it's like several fold, right?

138
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:03,648
As these things often are,

139
00:08:03,648 --> 00:08:04,950
because you look at this sort of,

140
00:08:06,072 --> 00:08:09,474
I think I have like, you know, three distinct sort of ways that I think about this.

141
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:12,116
Because firstly, there's the business perspective, right?

142
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,618
And if we're looking at...

143
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:17,921
Because I know the study looked at sort of the top five streamers

144
00:08:17,921 --> 00:08:20,063
and what games they're playing.

145
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:22,565
And so the reasons for...

146
00:08:22,565 --> 00:08:25,047
And often those are sort of AAA games, etc.

147
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:28,369
And the reasons why those games are often sort of perpetrating

148
00:08:28,369 --> 00:08:30,251
these types of, you know, these types of tropes, etc., is because

149
00:08:35,275 --> 00:08:41,537
you know, the games industry, as we know, we sort of, it's very like, most designs are very sort of

150
00:08:41,537 --> 00:08:47,018
iterative, right? Like, we take sort of what's worked before and innovate on it slightly,

151
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:51,539
because, you know, games are kind of, making games is inherently risky in a lot of ways.

152
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:56,301
It's financially risky. It's also really, really hard, right? Like, as we know, as game developers.

153
00:08:57,761 --> 00:09:00,402
Games can run into all kinds of...

154
00:09:00,402 --> 00:09:04,604
It's just an inherently tricky sort of technical and design

155
00:09:04,604 --> 00:09:06,745
sort of undertaking anytime you're making a game.

156
00:09:06,745 --> 00:09:09,766
And so often the things that...

157
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:16,528
So innovation can often be difficult in that context, especially...

158
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:18,889
So I think the thing I'm getting to is that...

159
00:09:19,762 --> 00:09:26,989
It really takes studios to hold values around wanting to break free of these tropes, right?

160
00:09:26,989 --> 00:09:34,858
It really does need to come from the business perspective, studio leadership, wanting to really take a stance and

161
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:41,719
and innovate on these types of representations. And part of that as well is, you know, something

162
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:50,067
I'll get to again more, is like who is in positions of decision making around what goes into a game,

163
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:55,432
right? Like who is being represented? Because as we know, often it is, you know,

164
00:09:55,432 --> 00:09:58,234
the games industry is overwhelmingly represented in leadership positions by

165
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:01,737
cis white men and cis white straight men.

166
00:10:01,737 --> 00:10:03,758
So we need to disrupt that.

167
00:10:03,758 --> 00:10:05,099
And the last thing I'll say,

168
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:07,780
I think from a design perspective,

169
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,043
you know, it's not that we don't have ways

170
00:10:12,043 --> 00:10:14,745
to think about better representation

171
00:10:14,745 --> 00:10:16,246
because there are plenty of developers out there

172
00:10:16,246 --> 00:10:16,886
who are doing that work.

173
00:10:16,886 --> 00:10:18,547
And often those are folks

174
00:10:18,547 --> 00:10:20,348
from marginalized backgrounds themselves

175
00:10:20,348 --> 00:10:22,029
who have perhaps, you know, smaller studios

176
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:22,350
or they're...

177
00:10:27,733 --> 00:10:32,516
doing work by themselves or in like tiny teams, but they need the opportunity to sort of have funding

178
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:37,700
to really have their ideas pushed forward. So we need to sort of, you know, this is a

179
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,582
wide-ranging problem and it's a structural problem that we need to disrupt.

180
00:10:40,582 --> 00:10:47,186
I definitely agree that this goes all the way through every level of like game development,

181
00:10:47,186 --> 00:10:50,769
like requires management to take a lead on this, requires like...

182
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:56,587
people in like your position in like leadership positions to take care of things,

183
00:10:56,587 --> 00:11:01,128
handle things much better than they've been handled before. And it tells different stories,

184
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:05,550
and it shows different types of like gameplay elements and risks. And yeah, it's risky,

185
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:11,251
but like it also will broaden what this industry can do and say, reaching out to folks who are

186
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:12,212
normally represented here.

187
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:16,342
Gina, I want to bug you about some more stuff.

188
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,807
What trends are you seeing in kind of the characters

189
00:11:18,807 --> 00:11:19,989
represented in video games?

190
00:11:19,989 --> 00:11:21,271
You touched on it a little bit,

191
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:23,295
but sort of in who gets represented

192
00:11:23,295 --> 00:11:24,578
and how they're being represented.

193
00:11:25,072 --> 00:11:29,594
Right, right. So male characters outnumbered female characters four to one,

194
00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:34,237
and white characters outnumbered characters of color three to one.

195
00:11:34,237 --> 00:11:38,719
Unfortunately, LGBTQ disabled and large body type characters are nearly

196
00:11:38,719 --> 00:11:43,661
non-existent. White male characters are twice as likely to carry a weapon

197
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:47,943
as male characters of color and are much more likely to be violent.

198
00:11:48,704 --> 00:11:51,328
particularly carrying a gun.

199
00:11:51,328 --> 00:11:54,632
And then when we look at the top 20 streamers,

200
00:11:54,632 --> 00:11:57,876
they are all men, only one is a man of color

201
00:11:57,876 --> 00:12:00,419
and only one identifies as LGBTQ.

202
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:05,626
And there's often a 10% of,

203
00:12:06,547 --> 00:12:14,530
streamers use homophobic or transphobic language, or that language appears in about 10% of segments,

204
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:22,533
no disabled characters, and then streamers often use ableist language in nearly half of the gameplay

205
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:28,936
segments, like some kind of variation of the ableist language, crazy in one in five game

206
00:12:28,936 --> 00:12:35,118
segments. So there's just a lot of that sort of...

207
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:44,088
negative stereotyping and violence and hyper masculinity going on in the characters that are

208
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:50,975
being played. You've also touched on what's the study revealed about the sexualization

209
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:54,038
of women as well because that was another thing that comes up quite frequently.

210
00:12:54,685 --> 00:12:58,808
Oh, yes. Well, yes, there's definitely a few female characters.

211
00:12:58,808 --> 00:13:02,791
There are they are they are tremendously

212
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,012
sexualized, hyper sexualized.

213
00:13:04,012 --> 00:13:10,437
And, you know, this also has a tremendous impact on

214
00:13:10,437 --> 00:13:14,040
both the concept of women feeling comfortable to join in

215
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,263
and play these same games and and how.

216
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:29,368
Women are viewed from a sort of hypermasculine lens that sees them more as sex objects rather than equal partners.

217
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:37,055
Female characters are 10 times more likely to be shown in revealing clothing than male characters.

218
00:13:37,055 --> 00:13:38,676
Definitely a large problem.

219
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,493
Um, what effect are we feeling this is having on the audience receiving the game?

220
00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:46,655
I imagine it's similar to what violence that effect has on like the males

221
00:13:46,655 --> 00:13:47,956
who are receiving these games.

222
00:13:47,956 --> 00:13:50,438
That's hoping to kind of open up both of you.

223
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:53,522
I mean, I can field that one.

224
00:13:53,522 --> 00:13:57,765
You know, in terms of, you know, just the experience,

225
00:13:57,765 --> 00:13:59,386
we know across like all kinds of media,

226
00:13:59,386 --> 00:14:00,647
and this is obviously, you know,

227
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:02,207
this is why it's so exciting to have Gina here

228
00:14:02,207 --> 00:14:02,968
to like talk about this,

229
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:07,010
because obviously the work that you've done across like

230
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,072
other sort of types of media representation

231
00:14:09,072 --> 00:14:11,113
also shows this, like representation matters.

232
00:14:11,113 --> 00:14:12,634
We know that.

233
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:14,195
I've felt that in my own life.

234
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:17,355
you know, being a little brown girl growing up,

235
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:19,216
playing video games from as long as I can remember,

236
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:23,637
you know, you sort of learn, and especially, you know,

237
00:14:23,637 --> 00:14:26,257
and this is why I was, as I was saying,

238
00:14:26,257 --> 00:14:27,778
like intersectionality is important.

239
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:29,738
We need to look at gender representation

240
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:31,318
together with race representation,

241
00:14:31,318 --> 00:14:34,299
because often, you know, for someone in my position,

242
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:35,999
like for instance, taking, I don't know,

243
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,100
like Street Fighter as an example,

244
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,760
just because I remember playing it when I was young,

245
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,121
and, you know, seeing that classic dilemma

246
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:43,121
that I think a lot of us faced of like.

247
00:14:44,061 --> 00:14:47,524
oh, are we the female character, are we Chun-Li?

248
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:51,327
Or in my case, am I Dal Sim, the one,

249
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:52,968
like, you know, the Indian character,

250
00:14:52,968 --> 00:14:55,710
which is not great representation, right?

251
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:00,054
And so it's like, oh, who is close enough

252
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:01,795
to how I feel like I'm represented?

253
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:05,959
And I think the thing that I often say about this

254
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:08,941
is I actually, even though I was making those decisions,

255
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:11,483
it didn't actually hit me for the longest time.

256
00:15:12,864 --> 00:15:17,386
that that was a decision I was making. Like I didn't, when I was like young and even in my

257
00:15:17,386 --> 00:15:22,009
teens often, like playing video games, I wasn't like, oh, you know, if only I could see myself,

258
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:27,632
because that wasn't even represented as, I wasn't even presented to me as an option, right? And so

259
00:15:27,632 --> 00:15:32,175
when you're sort of taught over and over that you're not going to be represented,

260
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:33,455
you sort of internalize like, oh,

261
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:36,977
maybe I'm not, maybe I don't deserve to be represented.

262
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:41,199
And that is sort of this really, you know,

263
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,419
it's something that a lot of us carry.

264
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:45,801
And it's in the work that I'm now doing

265
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:47,581
through my company, Glow Up,

266
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:50,783
where we're explicitly setting out to rectify that,

267
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,803
you know, like myself and my co-founder,

268
00:15:52,803 --> 00:15:57,585
Latoya Peterson, you know, as women and women of color,

269
00:15:57,585 --> 00:15:59,326
we, you know, we think about this a lot,

270
00:15:59,326 --> 00:16:00,747
like we've had these experiences.

271
00:16:00,747 --> 00:16:02,647
And so that's why we want to, you know,

272
00:16:02,647 --> 00:16:03,348
we want to do better.

273
00:16:04,556 --> 00:16:08,758
Yeah, I think it's important to be able to kind of see yourselves in these play experiences.

274
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:13,099
And it's important for the cis males to also see other people out in the world.

275
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:20,102
Like it gives you this closed world view to see no one but the same white males doing the same

276
00:16:20,102 --> 00:16:25,944
white male fantasy power fantasies all the time. So they're limited in kind of what they even

277
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:28,985
accept of the world or see of the world. They don't see that these people even exist out there.

278
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:33,102
So I kind of want to ask from the development side,

279
00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:36,204
Mitu, how does this affect developers

280
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:40,107
who are creating these kind of sexualized versions of women

281
00:16:40,107 --> 00:16:42,569
or these nasty stereotypes and things like that?

282
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,611
Because I feel that must have an effect

283
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:49,255
on a development team that spends months and years

284
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:51,977
crafting something, frankly, gross.

285
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:58,136
Well, I mean, I think the one thing I want to speak to is the experience of

286
00:16:58,136 --> 00:17:00,558
marginalized folks at these companies, right?

287
00:17:00,558 --> 00:17:06,384
So whether you're women or, you know, non-binary or, you know, from any other

288
00:17:06,384 --> 00:17:12,230
marginalized access, underrepresented access within games, often, you know, folks.

289
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,394
do want to be, especially if you're a big team

290
00:17:15,394 --> 00:17:18,579
where you don't have that decision-making power.

291
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,503
Like, you know, this is, none of this is stuff

292
00:17:21,503 --> 00:17:24,026
that developers don't already know, right?

293
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:27,992
But what will often happen is folks in leadership positions.

294
00:17:28,692 --> 00:17:34,634
will just cut certain, even if you,

295
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:38,395
I've got just countless stories of friends, et cetera,

296
00:17:38,395 --> 00:17:43,757
who've worked on games where you start including

297
00:17:43,757 --> 00:17:47,118
more diverse representation, but then as soon as,

298
00:17:47,118 --> 00:17:49,178
as games often do, as I said, making games is hard.

299
00:17:49,178 --> 00:17:52,179
So they come into, you run up against time and budget

300
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:53,279
and all these things.

301
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:55,160
And often because of the values of folks

302
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:55,980
in leadership positions,

303
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,942
the first thing to get cut is those diverse representations. And I think that is the thing

304
00:18:01,942 --> 00:18:08,584
that has the effect on folks, because they're being told like, oh, your experiences don't matter.

305
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:14,085
We can also take that further, right? Like today is, as we were talking about a little

306
00:18:14,085 --> 00:18:16,746
bit before this Joel, like today is a really interesting day to be.

307
00:18:17,386 --> 00:18:25,072
having this discussion, because, you know, as Bloomberg reported, the lawsuit by the

308
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:31,056
state of California against Activision Blizzard for the sort of alleged, you know, as they

309
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:37,541
call it, the frat boy culture within that space, like, the experience of being a marginalized

310
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,262
person within games is often a traumatic one.

311
00:18:39,262 --> 00:18:41,563
And that's something that we also need to rectify.

312
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:50,658
And if you're thinking of reading this in the audience,

313
00:18:50,658 --> 00:18:52,821
like looking at the articles in the lawsuit,

314
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:54,523
please, please take care of yourself.

315
00:18:54,523 --> 00:18:57,127
It is probably one of the most awful ones I've read

316
00:18:57,127 --> 00:18:59,530
in a good long time in this industry.

317
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,633
So please take care before you read it.

318
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,553
All right, uh, we'll just shift over a little bit.

319
00:19:05,553 --> 00:19:09,856
The findings in the study indicated popular stream games often promote

320
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:13,099
hypermasculinity through violence or personal gain and aggression like you

321
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:15,661
said earlier. Do we have any suggestions for

322
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:18,864
developers on how to better frame their game experiences to move away from this,

323
00:19:18,864 --> 00:19:22,167
better shape their characters to move away from this behavior even if

324
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:24,048
violence is kind of the focus of the game?

325
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:31,330
Right, well, it would be important, I think, for developers to consider examining,

326
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:34,352
do the male characters have to be aggressive all the time

327
00:19:34,352 --> 00:19:39,374
and repress their emotions and to fight anytime they feel threatened,

328
00:19:39,374 --> 00:19:42,095
which then results in more violence and more risky behavior.

329
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:50,723
you know, perhaps they can think about what are ways that the characters can face these challenges

330
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:57,088
in the game more creatively? What other more creative and mentally challenging ways can

331
00:19:57,088 --> 00:20:01,952
they address these problems or more clever things that the characters can do rather than just

332
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,534
shooting guns?

333
00:20:04,632 --> 00:20:12,945
and therefore, you know, acknowledge that they have a role to play in reinforcing positive

334
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:17,753
ideas of manhood, and I think that's very important.

335
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:26,728
To jump in on that as well, yeah, I think, sorry, I guess that's what you're going to ask.

336
00:20:26,728 --> 00:20:34,578
I think that, I think that, you know, there is such a rich landscape of types of

337
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:37,240
of types of game design that have yet to be explored and to be funded as well,

338
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,421
because these are types of things that lots of designers I know have sort of experimented with,

339
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:43,163
etc. Looking at ideas of vulnerability among male characters, like looking at...

340
00:20:43,163 --> 00:20:46,724
There was a wonderful talk by the developer Brie Code a couple of years ago at GDC

341
00:20:46,724 --> 00:20:48,886
about sort of tend and befriend mechanics in games.

342
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:05,915
So that's an area where there are folks doing work, but we need those ideas to be given

343
00:21:05,915 --> 00:21:08,838
the platform and those ideas to be pushed further.

344
00:21:08,838 --> 00:21:12,761
So I think that, yeah, and to speak to what Gina was saying about what other actions can

345
00:21:12,761 --> 00:21:12,921
there be.

346
00:21:19,726 --> 00:21:22,149
as a game design teacher, so when I teach game design at NYU, you know, one of the lenses we

347
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:25,632
have for thinking about game design is thinking about verbs that characters have, right, like,

348
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,394
or that you can do as a player. So what are the verbs that

349
00:21:35,803 --> 00:21:40,667
you know, like actions, like doing words that characters or the player is able to enact

350
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,969
within a game that aren't necessarily just, you know, combat related.

351
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,591
So there's, you know, there's, yeah, there's all kinds of things that we can be sort of

352
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:47,352
exploring further through games for sure.

353
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:02,344
you know, the idea of like friendship mechanics, the idea of the, you know, just exploring more

354
00:22:02,344 --> 00:22:09,669
vulnerability. And I think, you know, part of that is also thinking about like pro-social design,

355
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:13,772
right? So a lot of game design is often competitive or a lot of games, you know, in terms of the sort

356
00:22:13,772 --> 00:22:17,714
of subset of games we're talking about, there's, you know, like competitive gameplay versus

357
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:30,501
like thinking about like, oh, how do you design for sort of more pro-social interactions between

358
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:35,263
players? Like how does the game design actually help bring that about and reward those kinds of

359
00:22:35,263 --> 00:22:39,145
behaviors? So I think that's kind of what I found really interesting about the study is that it

360
00:22:39,145 --> 00:22:40,646
points to the sort of necessity of creating these spaces.

361
00:22:43,607 --> 00:22:50,892
for players of all genders really, but especially for those who are sort of affected by this,

362
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:56,496
like, or limited by this man box idea. Yeah, there's definitely some proof out there that

363
00:22:56,496 --> 00:23:02,740
shows like different experiences in games, like not the hardcore pure violent shooter is like.

364
00:23:03,045 --> 00:23:06,547
they're not the most popular things. They're still immensely popular, don't get me wrong,

365
00:23:06,547 --> 00:23:12,190
but these other experiences that push us to be more social or that can bring a little bit of fun

366
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:17,713
together or less focus on like harming other human beings and like more different styles of stories

367
00:23:17,713 --> 00:23:23,176
are starting to gain a lot of like power or power may not be the best word but they're getting their

368
00:23:23,176 --> 00:23:26,558
audience, they're getting their audience, people are seeing them and they're starting to be made

369
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:29,199
like there is some different stuff finally coming out there.

370
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,790
Yeah, there was some wonderful stuff.

371
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,552
We were talking a little bit earlier, Joel,

372
00:23:33,552 --> 00:23:35,274
about the IGF Awards last night, right?

373
00:23:35,274 --> 00:23:37,997
So we can see within that space,

374
00:23:37,997 --> 00:23:40,419
the sort of plethora of interesting,

375
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,843
like new types of games that are popular

376
00:23:43,843 --> 00:23:46,386
and that are being made, of course.

377
00:23:48,089 --> 00:23:53,591
Yeah, and that talk about community kind of like brings me to my next question for you, gang.

378
00:23:53,591 --> 00:23:57,332
Research has indicated that many males find game to be a connection with peers and community,

379
00:23:57,332 --> 00:24:01,774
like so even we're seeing it there, like they're finding there's a connection with those Twitch streamers

380
00:24:01,774 --> 00:24:06,235
or with their friends. So, and they're also saying according to your study, Gina, that it's a place

381
00:24:06,235 --> 00:24:11,097
that can be their true selves. Gaming also seems to connect these players with too many damaging

382
00:24:11,097 --> 00:24:12,838
stereotypes and visions of masculinity. So

383
00:24:13,658 --> 00:24:19,105
What sort of work do we feel game developers can do in trying to use this feeling of connection and community to build something more positive?

384
00:24:19,105 --> 00:24:25,272
Will we build on that natural, like, that desire to be together, but like, if this, like, and to build a better true self?

385
00:24:26,273 --> 00:24:33,297
Right, right. Well, we found a tremendous evidence for how important the connection with

386
00:24:33,297 --> 00:24:41,282
with peers and friends and community is to people who game. Our survey showed that

387
00:24:41,282 --> 00:24:47,946
in the gaming culture, 91 percent of boys and 86 percent of men say that playing video games

388
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:54,049
is an important way for them to connect with their male friends. But unfortunately, young gamers

389
00:24:56,152 --> 00:25:00,993
experienced a tremendous amount of bullying and harassment in online gaming.

390
00:25:00,993 --> 00:25:05,094
And older respondents said they routinely witness homophobia

391
00:25:05,094 --> 00:25:07,194
and racism and online gaming.

392
00:25:07,194 --> 00:25:12,315
So the the culture is providing valuable human connection

393
00:25:12,315 --> 00:25:14,916
and certainly a space to do that.

394
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:20,557
But the ongoing concern is that the culture often normalizes violence and hate.

395
00:25:20,557 --> 00:25:24,578
And so the thing to think about is, since there's such a positive aspect

396
00:25:24,578 --> 00:25:25,518
that you can gain.

397
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,699
from developing community and sharing time,

398
00:25:28,699 --> 00:25:32,561
special time with your friends through gaming,

399
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:35,382
how can we make it a more positive experience

400
00:25:35,382 --> 00:25:41,585
and subject you to less bullying, harassment, and violence?

401
00:25:43,733 --> 00:25:45,935
There has to be positive things that

402
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:50,959
ways to make the experience more positive and creative.

403
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:56,063
And, you know, we know that what happens in the fictional world

404
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:59,085
does have a real life impact and.

405
00:26:00,486 --> 00:26:05,147
the online gaming provides incredibly important opportunities

406
00:26:05,147 --> 00:26:08,208
for boys and young men to connect,

407
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:11,389
but we need to make it so, as you said,

408
00:26:11,389 --> 00:26:15,210
they can feel like they're being their true selves online

409
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,491
and not having to reinforce toxic prejudices

410
00:26:18,491 --> 00:26:19,372
and toxic masculinity.

411
00:26:19,372 --> 00:26:20,152
Yeah, your study brought up,

412
00:26:20,152 --> 00:26:24,573
they mentioned true self came up a lot.

413
00:26:24,573 --> 00:26:26,614
I wonder how much true self is,

414
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:33,935
um I I this is me without rules not this is is this who I really am or is this who I am when

415
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:41,377
the boys all want to be bad and I want to be bad together like does it just feed that kind of nature

416
00:26:41,377 --> 00:26:46,899
and do the males just kind of assume that's their true self because this is what I am without rules

417
00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:48,420
and when it thinks of me like I hope

418
00:26:49,538 --> 00:26:51,660
I know you're saying this is just me.

419
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,981
This is just me speculating.

420
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:57,825
But but but you do have to wonder, can they be their true selves

421
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:02,668
when there's so much emphasis on being hypermasculine and

422
00:27:02,668 --> 00:27:06,611
and embracing violence?

423
00:27:06,611 --> 00:27:09,754
You know, is is some of it posturing, especially with young boys?

424
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:12,316
You know, are they really feeling that?

425
00:27:12,316 --> 00:27:16,078
Or is that or do they have to emphasize hypermasculinity

426
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:17,600
in order to feel like they belong?

427
00:27:19,154 --> 00:27:21,296
Yeah, it's definitely a problem.

428
00:27:21,296 --> 00:27:23,497
And I mean, like you said, with the bullying being an issue

429
00:27:23,497 --> 00:27:26,360
and all the homophobia slurs getting thrown around,

430
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,401
like, are you being your true self

431
00:27:28,401 --> 00:27:30,763
or have you been kind of cowed into this position?

432
00:27:30,763 --> 00:27:34,265
So it's feeding a lot of like negative stereotypes

433
00:27:34,265 --> 00:27:34,866
to your point.

434
00:27:36,983 --> 00:27:42,169
So I think just to jump in on that as well, it seems like, you know, one of the things

435
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:49,717
that the study, you know, seems to point to is like, yeah, just these spaces being opportunities

436
00:27:49,717 --> 00:27:55,924
for male identifying folks and cis men, especially like being able to connect, right?

437
00:27:57,614 --> 00:28:01,498
you know, and I want, and to some extent it's because like the parameters that the rest of

438
00:28:01,498 --> 00:28:07,163
society is set is like, oh, these are the ways in which you like, number one, can connect,

439
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:12,328
you know, in this, in this like very limited kind of, in this very limited kind of way.

440
00:28:12,328 --> 00:28:16,952
So that's kind of one part of it, like, oh, if there's sort of, if there are sort of other types

441
00:28:16,952 --> 00:28:17,033
of, um,

442
00:28:19,735 --> 00:28:23,296
sort of like more pro-social environments, which, you know,

443
00:28:23,296 --> 00:28:25,837
which, and this is like, this is beyond a games problem,

444
00:28:25,837 --> 00:28:28,478
right, because this is again, like, this is what the,

445
00:28:28,478 --> 00:28:30,859
this is like a societal problem writ large, as we know,

446
00:28:30,859 --> 00:28:32,900
as many things are.

447
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,681
So I think that's, that's sort of one part of it.

448
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:37,642
The, the other thing that I thought was really interesting

449
00:28:37,642 --> 00:28:41,904
about like the study to speak to that kind of power fantasy

450
00:28:41,904 --> 00:28:43,544
element of games is,

451
00:28:43,544 --> 00:28:46,345
and I think you touched on this earlier, Gina,

452
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:46,946
when you said,

453
00:28:47,906 --> 00:28:51,089
that in terms of sort of representations of like aggression, etc.

454
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:58,175
It's white male protagonists who are enacting those without

455
00:28:58,175 --> 00:29:00,478
without sort of like other reasons.

456
00:29:00,478 --> 00:29:02,680
And I think one of the things that I found interesting about the study

457
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,802
is looking at like, oh, when there are characters of color

458
00:29:05,802 --> 00:29:06,383
who are also being.

459
00:29:08,225 --> 00:29:11,769
being violent in some way or being aggressive in some way,

460
00:29:11,769 --> 00:29:13,330
often it's for this larger social good,

461
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:17,615
which is sort of like a trope in itself, right?

462
00:29:17,615 --> 00:29:18,857
But it's just interesting.

463
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:22,401
Like, I just thought that was an interesting finding

464
00:29:22,401 --> 00:29:24,663
from the study.

465
00:29:24,663 --> 00:29:25,985
Definitely a little piece that came out of it.

466
00:29:25,985 --> 00:29:27,046
Sorry, I was talking to you.

467
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:32,732
No, I was just going to say, I did find it very interesting that that

468
00:29:32,732 --> 00:29:37,414
white characters were so much more violent than than characters of color.

469
00:29:37,414 --> 00:29:39,995
It's not like we say, hey, let's make it equal.

470
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:43,716
Let's get the characters of color more violent.

471
00:29:43,716 --> 00:29:46,457
It's let's get the white characters less violent.

472
00:29:46,457 --> 00:29:46,717
All right.

473
00:29:50,296 --> 00:29:55,579
So I know we're kind of we're heading towards the talk about management, but I wanted to ask,

474
00:29:55,579 --> 00:30:00,561
and maybe this is unfair to ask me too, but what do you feel that individuals working at

475
00:30:00,561 --> 00:30:05,824
game development companies like all the way down the ladder can push and do to help like work for

476
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:11,607
better representation and deter toxicity sexism and those things? And I mean we've seen again

477
00:30:11,607 --> 00:30:16,449
those gross allegations go all the way up the ladder. We've talked about how it's that change

478
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:18,930
really needs to come from up top. But I mean what can...

479
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:23,364
your white guy in the office do, like, what do we need to do?

480
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:26,767
Yeah, I mean, yes, oof, again, what a day to be.

481
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:30,050
Yeah, I think this is, I think we need to talk about it today.

482
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:33,562
Absolutely. And, you know, and I think that, firstly, you know, just

483
00:30:33,562 --> 00:30:37,145
reiterating that ultimately, these problems go up to leadership, right?

484
00:30:37,145 --> 00:30:41,368
Like that is ultimately like, it's these things start from the top.

485
00:30:41,368 --> 00:30:46,672
So companies and leaders need to have values where they care about these issues.

486
00:30:46,672 --> 00:30:51,496
And often, you know, and the way that I look at it, and often, yeah, it's

487
00:30:51,496 --> 00:30:54,518
it can be complex as well, because it's not to say that.

488
00:30:55,199 --> 00:30:58,861
Folks from marginalized backgrounds can't also, you know, if they've bought into these

489
00:30:58,861 --> 00:31:01,483
hegemonic ideas, they can't also perpetrate this.

490
00:31:01,483 --> 00:31:06,626
But I think, you know, it really does come from a question of values from the top, because

491
00:31:06,626 --> 00:31:09,888
that's also like, who gets you listened to at the company?

492
00:31:09,888 --> 00:31:11,289
Who gets supported at the company?

493
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:12,390
What is the overall culture at the company?

494
00:31:16,232 --> 00:31:17,492
So that's definitely one part of it.

495
00:31:17,492 --> 00:31:20,193
In terms of sort of every, like, you know,

496
00:31:20,193 --> 00:31:24,395
just folks who are not in leadership positions necessarily.

497
00:31:24,395 --> 00:31:26,616
I mean, firstly, you know, we as an industry

498
00:31:26,616 --> 00:31:28,196
need to support marginalized folks

499
00:31:28,196 --> 00:31:30,157
being able to get to leadership positions because.

500
00:31:31,218 --> 00:31:32,740
It's not just a pipeline problem.

501
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,400
This is what I say.

502
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,244
And you know, I'm lucky enough to be like a,

503
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:40,068
if then STEM ambassador, like I do all kinds of work

504
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:42,871
to sort of help get more folks into the industry.

505
00:31:42,871 --> 00:31:45,614
But the biggest problem is that once they're there,

506
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:48,277
they're not being supported and able to stay.

507
00:31:48,277 --> 00:31:49,118
And that's because they're not.

508
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:54,140
you know, it's at the least worst end of the spectrum, it's because they're not being listened

509
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:58,601
to. And as we've seen in the worst end of the spectrum, it's, you know, stuff like what's

510
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:04,623
coming out in the allegations, which is like, just sort of the tip of the iceberg in a lot of ways

511
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:09,325
in terms of like the what really is going on. So one of the last thing I'll say about that is that

512
00:32:09,325 --> 00:32:11,626
it is incumbent upon allies, often like cis white men, allies to

513
00:32:17,027 --> 00:32:23,814
step up and intervene when they see these things happen. There's all kinds of things that can be

514
00:32:23,814 --> 00:32:31,642
said about that, but the burden shouldn't be on marginalized folks to drive the change,

515
00:32:31,642 --> 00:32:38,028
and often it is us who is doing it. So that's another thing where, again, who gets listened to?

516
00:32:38,028 --> 00:32:41,631
Where is the locus of power in the industry? So that's something we need to disrupt.

517
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:48,364
There's definitely a lot of marginalized folks literally just thrown into the wolves for

518
00:32:48,364 --> 00:32:52,647
a claim of diversity when nothing is actually changing in management.

519
00:32:52,647 --> 00:32:58,532
Maybe I'm just speculating on this point, but perhaps some of that community feeling

520
00:32:58,532 --> 00:32:59,693
could be of value.

521
00:32:59,693 --> 00:33:03,676
Because like, Gina, to your point, like the males feel there's a sense of community and

522
00:33:03,676 --> 00:33:04,217
working with that.

523
00:33:04,217 --> 00:33:04,617
But there's...

524
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:09,086
The people in power who cause these errors feel they're all right in it.

525
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:10,287
I mean, this is perfect.

526
00:33:10,287 --> 00:33:11,749
This is, again, this is just my speculation.

527
00:33:11,749 --> 00:33:17,593
So meeting those walls of like their peers saying, hey, no, this is not right what you're

528
00:33:17,593 --> 00:33:24,538
doing uses that sense of community and games to show them, no, this behavior is not acceptable

529
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:28,361
because when we're silent, I think everything's fine.

530
00:33:30,361 --> 00:33:34,746
All right, so let me tell you, you smashed through my next question.

531
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:35,467
Oh, sorry.

532
00:33:35,467 --> 00:33:41,815
No, it was perfect. It's like, shoot, you're doubling up on my questions. All right.

533
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:44,133
I got another one on, let's say,

534
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:48,055
like the platform holders for like Twitch and that,

535
00:33:48,055 --> 00:33:49,876
not just, Twitch just came for a moment,

536
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:51,077
it's not the one I'm specifically calling out,

537
00:33:51,077 --> 00:33:53,237
but like streaming platform holders.

538
00:33:53,237 --> 00:33:55,999
Do we feel they have some responsibility

539
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:58,040
and who kind of, who gets pushed to the front

540
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,080
as their popular streamers

541
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,001
and you know, what we can kind of work with there?

542
00:34:01,001 --> 00:34:07,244
Gina, do you have any thoughts on that?

543
00:34:07,244 --> 00:34:08,444
So, so say it again.

544
00:34:08,444 --> 00:34:11,646
Sorry, I phrased that really funny.

545
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,121
Do we wonder if streamers, like stream platform holders,

546
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:19,583
like where you're getting your footage for your study,

547
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:22,184
if they have some responsibility they could possibly work

548
00:34:22,184 --> 00:34:24,005
or tools they could possibly work with

549
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:31,908
to kind of promote more positive representation?

550
00:34:31,908 --> 00:34:34,770
Well, right.

551
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:39,892
They would have to be creative about it.

552
00:34:39,892 --> 00:34:41,713
In other words, they would have to sort of...

553
00:34:43,504 --> 00:34:46,225
maybe talk about the limitations they feel the game has,

554
00:34:46,225 --> 00:34:50,045
or maybe, you know, it'd be helpful if they talked about

555
00:34:50,045 --> 00:34:53,426
ways that they could creatively think of changing,

556
00:34:53,426 --> 00:34:55,226
getting away from as much violence

557
00:34:55,226 --> 00:35:00,027
and getting more creativity and cooperation in the games

558
00:35:00,027 --> 00:35:04,268
and less stereotyping and hyper-masculinity.

559
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,628
I mean, they're certainly incredible influencers,

560
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:09,989
so it seems like they should be part of the conversation

561
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:12,930
if they would like to help impact the industry.

562
00:35:15,305 --> 00:35:20,749
And yeah, so jumping on that as well.

563
00:35:20,749 --> 00:35:23,011
Yeah, I think if your question is like,

564
00:35:23,011 --> 00:35:28,635
do platform holders have responsibility to shift the picture of representation in the industry?

565
00:35:28,635 --> 00:35:30,136
My answer is absolutely yes.

566
00:35:31,176 --> 00:35:38,401
doing more and some platforms are starting to do this and certainly the conversations around

567
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:42,644
race that started last summer definitely pushed more of these platform holders to

568
00:35:42,644 --> 00:35:51,009
have those conversations and push marginalized folks in terms of who gets featured, etc.

569
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,794
you know, we exist. Like, there's, you know, there's, there's plenty of streamers out there

570
00:35:57,794 --> 00:36:03,198
from, from, you know, from diverse backgrounds. And I want to shout out to communities like

571
00:36:03,198 --> 00:36:10,123
Black Girl Gamers, Brown Girl Game Code, you know, the Noir Network, like there are just,

572
00:36:10,123 --> 00:36:15,908
you know, there are communities where, you know, you can find all kinds of, you know,

573
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:20,051
all kinds of other voices to profile and to sort of give a platform to.

574
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:25,536
So if we want wider systemic change, that is a really key part of it.

575
00:36:25,536 --> 00:36:28,719
It's vital for those platform holders to take a hand in it.

576
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:38,208
Gina, do you feel there's any aspect of the study I haven't touched on that you kind of wanted to push forward or talk about?

577
00:36:38,208 --> 00:36:42,071
No, you've covered a lot of it.

578
00:36:42,071 --> 00:36:46,435
You've done an excellent job so far.

579
00:36:48,176 --> 00:36:51,598
I can't think of. I'm sure I hadn't missed any important kind of elements of it.

580
00:36:51,598 --> 00:36:53,760
Right. Right. So

581
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,864
is the study going to become available publicly anytime soon?

582
00:36:59,864 --> 00:37:04,627
Yes, it is. It's it's available on our website, which is CJane.org

583
00:37:04,627 --> 00:37:05,808
S E E J A N E.org.

584
00:37:05,808 --> 00:37:10,911
Yes. It just got released today, right?

585
00:37:10,911 --> 00:37:12,032
Yes. Yes.

586
00:37:12,537 --> 00:37:14,298
which is exciting.

587
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:17,579
So, like I said, I got to have a sneak peek at it.

588
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:19,939
So yeah, excited for other folks to see it as well.

589
00:37:19,939 --> 00:37:22,520
Yeah, it's very exciting, very interesting.

590
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,461
Yeah, has anyone been requesting the study

591
00:37:26,461 --> 00:37:31,622
or like, I guess, what's your next step from here?

592
00:37:31,622 --> 00:37:34,523
Well, do events like this promoted

593
00:37:34,523 --> 00:37:37,424
and bring it to attention,

594
00:37:37,424 --> 00:37:39,864
hopefully be in some articles about it.

595
00:37:39,864 --> 00:37:40,204
And...

596
00:37:41,585 --> 00:37:46,790
you know, move forward, you know, we really value our relationship, our partnership with Promundo,

597
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:54,236
so we can intend to keep working with them on this type of thing and see if we can make some progress.

598
00:37:54,236 --> 00:38:03,843
Sounds great. So, we're really looking at kind of management as being a central issue here.

599
00:38:03,843 --> 00:38:10,949
So, and we're pushing, we would like to see more marginalized people in positions of management.

600
00:38:11,427 --> 00:38:17,154
This is a difficult question to ask, but how do we think that can happen?

601
00:38:17,154 --> 00:38:22,440
Is there ways we can see the industry, like the bigger giants in the industry,

602
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,503
like help make that change?

603
00:38:26,496 --> 00:38:33,558
So I think from my perspective, it's, you know, it's, it's, there's multiple facets to it, right?

604
00:38:33,558 --> 00:38:39,020
As I was saying before, it's creating environments where marginalized folks are not leaking out of

605
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:45,023
the industry, right? Like there is a huge leaky bucket problem, as we call it. There's the old

606
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:47,503
adage that within games, if you've...

607
00:38:47,824 --> 00:38:54,794
If you've had a career longer than five years, you're deemed a veteran because the dropout rate from the industry is so high.

608
00:38:54,794 --> 00:39:02,424
It's high for anybody because there's such a burnout culture in many ways, but then that's especially true.

609
00:39:03,665 --> 00:39:04,866
you know, for marginalized folks.

610
00:39:04,866 --> 00:39:07,087
So that aspect, absolutely,

611
00:39:07,087 --> 00:39:10,009
like allowing folks to survive in the industry

612
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:11,670
long enough and thrive, you know,

613
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,410
let's just not survive.

614
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:15,492
Let's like, let's create conditions for people

615
00:39:15,492 --> 00:39:18,593
from marginalized backgrounds to thrive in the industry

616
00:39:18,593 --> 00:39:21,835
such that they can reach these positions

617
00:39:21,835 --> 00:39:23,216
of leadership and management.

618
00:39:23,216 --> 00:39:24,316
So that's definitely one of them.

619
00:39:24,657 --> 00:39:30,120
And I think secondly, in terms of, because, you know, one of the things that I'm lucky enough to see

620
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:35,663
through the work I do as an educator and just, you know, just being able to

621
00:39:35,663 --> 00:39:39,865
say shout out to organizations like Game Devs of Color,

622
00:39:39,865 --> 00:39:44,027
where, you know, there are lots of sort of up and coming marginalized devs

623
00:39:44,027 --> 00:39:47,389
who like have like amazing games and amazing ideas, etc.

624
00:39:47,389 --> 00:39:47,849
But they need.

625
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,291
access to resources and funding.

626
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:53,392
And that is something that needs to also come from the top

627
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:56,294
because one of the things that we see

628
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:59,256
in terms of like indie studios that get formed,

629
00:39:59,256 --> 00:40:00,356
often the ones that get funded

630
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:03,638
are the ones who've come out of the big Activision blizzards

631
00:40:03,638 --> 00:40:05,940
and the riots and like all of these other places.

632
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:10,202
So allowing access to funds for folks

633
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:11,283
from more kinds of backgrounds

634
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,103
is gonna be super important.

635
00:40:12,103 --> 00:40:14,024
Are there any good sources of funding that exist now?

636
00:40:19,414 --> 00:40:20,016
that you're aware of?

637
00:40:20,016 --> 00:40:22,523
Sources of funding.

638
00:40:24,147 --> 00:40:26,088
Yeah, of course.

639
00:40:26,088 --> 00:40:30,451
So, well, it's, you know, this is something I could definitely speak to,

640
00:40:30,451 --> 00:40:34,975
but, you know, there's, I do want to shout out to things like WINGS Fund,

641
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:39,298
which is something that I'm, you know, on the advisory board for as well,

642
00:40:39,298 --> 00:40:43,822
which is a fund specifically funding folks from marginalized backgrounds

643
00:40:43,822 --> 00:40:45,023
and marginalized genders.

644
00:40:45,023 --> 00:40:52,829
There's also, shout out to Galaxy Fund, which is run by some of the folks who started Glitch.

645
00:40:53,449 --> 00:40:57,612
which is another sort of newer sort of source of funding

646
00:40:57,612 --> 00:40:59,473
who are very interested in sort of pushing forward

647
00:40:59,473 --> 00:41:03,195
the landscape for underrepresented developers as well.

648
00:41:03,195 --> 00:41:05,756
So yeah, I mean, you know, there's just not enough.

649
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:08,137
And that's the thing, and we need to, you know,

650
00:41:08,137 --> 00:41:12,200
disrupt like who, from more traditional sources of funding,

651
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,880
because like, again, those organizations

652
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,981
that I shouted out to,

653
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:16,742
it's marginalized folks setting those up often, right?

654
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:18,403
So, you know, but we need people who are in,

655
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:28,272
existing sort of seats of power within the industry to also make those changes and hold

656
00:41:28,272 --> 00:41:36,560
those values. Yeah, like we keep saying it comes from up top. Not that, oh, I'm barely hearing

657
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,705
things. All right.

658
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:49,773
You two are too quick. You literally burned through three prepared questions.

659
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:51,574
So we are in uncharted territory here.

660
00:41:51,574 --> 00:41:59,439
Gina, I noticed in your study that there has been a little bit of growth over the years.

661
00:41:59,439 --> 00:42:01,801
You notice between your study and I think there was another one done.

662
00:42:01,801 --> 00:42:04,743
What was it, 10 years ago? Or it was quite a bit older.

663
00:42:05,092 --> 00:42:06,913
Oh, that we did or?

664
00:42:06,913 --> 00:42:11,097
Yeah, or at least some of the numbers have gone up very slightly,

665
00:42:11,097 --> 00:42:11,738
but they have gone.

666
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:16,383
There has been some positive change.

667
00:42:16,383 --> 00:42:18,505
There's some positive change.

668
00:42:18,505 --> 00:42:18,825
OK, sure. Yeah.

669
00:42:18,825 --> 00:42:23,530
I don't have I don't have the old numbers in front of me, but

670
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:24,450
but yeah, you know.

671
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:31,356
The change is too glacial, you know, obviously at this point.

672
00:42:31,356 --> 00:42:35,579
This has been, I mean, we could have said all this about games

673
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:39,422
10 and 20 years ago, the same problems showing themselves.

674
00:42:39,422 --> 00:42:41,804
So it just it needs.

675
00:42:42,965 --> 00:42:47,749
I guess it just needs some enthusiasm to rethink this and see how

676
00:42:47,749 --> 00:42:50,631
how can we really make it

677
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:56,316
a more positive influence on society, you know, and

678
00:42:56,316 --> 00:43:00,879
and make it even more fun and more interesting and challenging and

679
00:43:00,879 --> 00:43:05,063
and a place to feel

680
00:43:05,063 --> 00:43:10,427
not only welcome, but more supported and safe and inclusive.

681
00:43:10,427 --> 00:43:10,527
Yeah.

682
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:19,262
So we're seeing any sort of like little, like to Jean's point, glacial changes in positivity,

683
00:43:19,262 --> 00:43:23,266
treatments of like marginalized folks and.

684
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:25,789
Well, there's yeah, I mean.

685
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:29,729
Yes, things are definitely moving forward.

686
00:43:29,729 --> 00:43:34,615
You know, there are more, again, you know, there's more marginalized

687
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:37,318
folks coming into the industry than ever before.

688
00:43:37,318 --> 00:43:40,642
But again, reiterating we need to create the systems of support

689
00:43:40,642 --> 00:43:41,443
to be able to keep them there.

690
00:43:41,443 --> 00:43:45,868
There's the work that we're obviously doing at Glow Up Games.

691
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:51,573
which is, you know, just a, we're a, we're proud to be like a really diverse studio ourselves,

692
00:43:51,573 --> 00:43:58,780
like I said. So, and you know, we've, we fought hard to get there as well. We're, I think the

693
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:04,505
first, the first studio of our kind, like the first all women of color founded mobile game studio to

694
00:44:04,505 --> 00:44:09,770
have raised over a million dollars in seed funding. So, you know, there's, there's, there's

695
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,312
change is, is happening slowly. Just, we've got to,

696
00:44:12,812 --> 00:44:16,873
there's a lot of fighting to do to get there and that's something that you know so many of us are

697
00:44:16,873 --> 00:44:21,054
working to change. Yeah I didn't want to imply that there was a we're good now because things

698
00:44:21,054 --> 00:44:28,216
are doing great now we're getting slightly better but no like it's to Gina's point again

699
00:44:28,216 --> 00:44:32,917
change is glacial that we're seeing and as we're seeing in places like the

700
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:39,859
allegations that Activision Blizzard it's not actually happening probably at all so there's a

701
00:44:39,859 --> 00:44:40,039
lot of

702
00:44:40,501 --> 00:44:43,582
That's stuff that kind of needs to get dealt with at the moment.

703
00:44:43,582 --> 00:44:45,282
Yeah. Well, I have. Oh, sorry.

704
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:49,844
Go ahead. I was going to say that I would also encourage

705
00:44:49,844 --> 00:44:52,505
people in the industry and create us to to use our research.

706
00:44:52,505 --> 00:44:56,446
You know, it's available to everyone and has some valuable insights

707
00:44:56,446 --> 00:44:57,406
in there for everybody.

708
00:44:57,406 --> 00:45:01,808
So I think it'd be important for for the community to look at that.

709
00:45:03,427 --> 00:45:06,328
I have a question for Gina, actually, if I may.

710
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:10,150
So I'm curious, because you do so much great work

711
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,951
in sort of other types of media and film and TV

712
00:45:12,951 --> 00:45:14,972
around representation,

713
00:45:14,972 --> 00:45:17,213
what are the sort of similarities you're seeing

714
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:19,414
and what are the sort of differences you're seeing

715
00:45:19,414 --> 00:45:21,655
between those spaces and, you know,

716
00:45:21,655 --> 00:45:24,456
as you've sort of set your foot in looking at this

717
00:45:24,456 --> 00:45:25,616
in the games industry as well?

718
00:45:26,238 --> 00:45:29,680
Right. Well, yeah, our first

719
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:36,924
the reason I started the Institute and the and the original

720
00:45:36,924 --> 00:45:41,486
object was to impact on screen character representation

721
00:45:41,486 --> 00:45:45,468
and what kids see, because I felt that there were some

722
00:45:47,129 --> 00:45:53,012
negative messages coming through, especially about females and a profound lack of female characters

723
00:45:53,012 --> 00:45:59,016
in what was made for little kids and why are we teaching children to have unconscious bias from

724
00:45:59,016 --> 00:46:06,921
the beginning. And we've had some really very good success in making a difference in the 15 years

725
00:46:06,921 --> 00:46:07,901
that we've been doing it.

726
00:46:09,590 --> 00:46:14,033
And it's really been through the research.

727
00:46:14,033 --> 00:46:16,654
The research has had the most impact for us

728
00:46:16,654 --> 00:46:20,777
in that a lot of times people aren't aware fully

729
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:21,457
of what they're making.

730
00:46:21,457 --> 00:46:26,760
They see it one way, but when the research shows

731
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,582
that it's actually another way.

732
00:46:29,582 --> 00:46:31,543
So just learning about what they're actually showing.

733
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,782
helps them realize they need to make a change.

734
00:46:34,782 --> 00:46:39,645
And so we can hope that the research will inspire change

735
00:46:39,645 --> 00:46:43,148
in the same way, sorry, in the gaming industry,

736
00:46:43,148 --> 00:46:47,091
where they say, wow, we didn't realize that that was the case

737
00:46:47,091 --> 00:46:51,094
and how poor our representation is of people of color

738
00:46:51,094 --> 00:46:54,836
and with disabilities and LGBTQIA+.

739
00:46:54,836 --> 00:46:57,999
So let's try making some changes.

740
00:46:57,999 --> 00:47:00,681
So, I mean, that is a hopeful outcome for this.

741
00:47:02,521 --> 00:47:05,203
Yeah, there's some difficulties coming up for,

742
00:47:05,203 --> 00:47:07,724
well, I imagine there are,

743
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:09,385
with showing people data and having them face

744
00:47:09,385 --> 00:47:12,887
what these unconscious biases.

745
00:47:12,887 --> 00:47:13,988
Right, right.

746
00:47:13,988 --> 00:47:18,470
It's an incredible, you know, powerful,

747
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:21,732
incredibly powerful unconscious biases

748
00:47:21,732 --> 00:47:26,835
where you literally can't see what it is you're making.

749
00:47:26,835 --> 00:47:30,197
And it was,

750
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:36,423
It was so eye opening to people when we had I mean, I suspected that

751
00:47:36,423 --> 00:47:37,943
that people weren't adding female characters

752
00:47:37,943 --> 00:47:41,624
because they didn't realize that they weren't including enough female characters.

753
00:47:41,624 --> 00:47:46,445
They thought they were doing right by girls and

754
00:47:46,445 --> 00:47:50,025
but pointing it out to them and helping them see what they're actually making

755
00:47:50,025 --> 00:47:51,045
made all the difference.

756
00:47:51,045 --> 00:47:55,506
And we've actually now the most exciting goal that we've achieved

757
00:47:55,506 --> 00:47:59,687
is that lead characters

758
00:47:59,687 --> 00:48:00,127
being

759
00:48:01,667 --> 00:48:06,369
for lead characters in both children's television and movies made for children,

760
00:48:06,369 --> 00:48:10,671
we've now achieved parity between the male and female lead characters.

761
00:48:10,671 --> 00:48:12,052
So this is monumental.

762
00:48:12,052 --> 00:48:13,972
It's never happened before.

763
00:48:13,972 --> 00:48:17,834
And it's a huge change since we started 15 years ago.

764
00:48:17,834 --> 00:48:21,875
So so dramatic progress can be made.

765
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:24,457
People just have to be aware that it needs to be made.

766
00:48:25,893 --> 00:48:33,076
Yeah, I love that because, you know, to speak to one of the reasons why I started

767
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:39,959
Blow Up Games, my company, is, you know, feeling simultaneously inspired by but then frustrated by

768
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:45,921
the positive state changes that we were seeing in like film and TV, with creators of colour

769
00:48:45,921 --> 00:48:48,362
taking the helm more and more, and more creators of colour.

770
00:48:48,722 --> 00:48:52,845
starting their own production companies and being able to get like have those opportunities,

771
00:48:52,845 --> 00:48:59,049
but then realizing like, oh, like that same change just isn't happening in the games industry. And so

772
00:48:59,049 --> 00:49:05,333
wanting to really sort of step up and, and, you know, try and bring that change into effect. So,

773
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:09,976
yeah, you know, for, for example, you know, creators like Issa Rae, who, you know,

774
00:49:09,976 --> 00:49:11,977
and we're at Glow Up, full disclosure, we're,

775
00:49:12,457 --> 00:49:14,918
we're working on a tie-in game for her hit TV show, Insecure.

776
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:18,578
So, you know, just, but that to us, like, speaks to that difference, right?

777
00:49:18,578 --> 00:49:23,259
Between, like, the changes, as you're saying, Gina, that have happened in, you know,

778
00:49:23,259 --> 00:49:23,779
in film, in TV, et cetera.

779
00:49:23,779 --> 00:49:27,360
But, you know, the games industry basically just has a long way to go.

780
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:31,521
Gina, we really appreciate the work you've put into giving us some hard data

781
00:49:31,521 --> 00:49:32,161
to show the developers.

782
00:49:32,161 --> 00:49:32,501
Like, that...

783
00:49:41,652 --> 00:49:43,954
this needs to move, this needs to change.

784
00:49:43,954 --> 00:49:46,537
These are the, this is the ugly truth on paper.

785
00:49:46,537 --> 00:49:48,618
Like these are the actual numbers and percentages.

786
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:49,459
It's undeniable.

787
00:49:49,459 --> 00:49:52,922
So thank you so much for putting in that work.

788
00:49:52,922 --> 00:49:56,225
Well, yeah, and that's our goal is to take our study

789
00:49:56,225 --> 00:50:00,970
to all the leading game developers and companies

790
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:03,352
to share it with them privately

791
00:50:03,352 --> 00:50:06,615
and see what we can encourage to happen.

792
00:50:09,333 --> 00:50:10,975
I want to thank you both for coming out.

793
00:50:10,975 --> 00:50:13,156
And this was a fantastic talk

794
00:50:13,156 --> 00:50:14,558
and I think an important time for it.

795
00:50:14,558 --> 00:50:16,019
Gina, thank you very much.

796
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:17,440
My pleasure, thank you.

797
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,742
Thank you so much as well for coming out.

798
00:50:19,742 --> 00:50:22,364
If you have anything in closing to say to the audience,

799
00:50:22,364 --> 00:50:25,226
I mean, feel free.

800
00:50:25,226 --> 00:50:26,587
No, just that I love gaming.

801
00:50:26,587 --> 00:50:31,311
Every day, every day I play games far too long.

802
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:33,492
People say, oh, you're so busy.

803
00:50:33,492 --> 00:50:35,074
I'm like, really, is that why I have...

804
00:50:36,205 --> 00:50:38,746
such a high score on Candy Crush.

805
00:50:38,746 --> 00:50:43,588
So it's a it's definitely probably a mind beat.

806
00:50:43,588 --> 00:50:49,091
I yeah, I love I love playing games and it's important to me.

807
00:50:49,091 --> 00:50:53,954
And so so this is all really fun and and important to me.

808
00:50:53,954 --> 00:50:56,315
And I have two boys, teenage boys.

809
00:50:56,315 --> 00:50:58,536
So, yeah, it's all very important to me.

810
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:05,804
Yeah, I think that's the vital thing. We all love games and we want them to be better.

811
00:51:05,804 --> 00:51:08,545
That's really what we're asking for at the end of the day.

812
00:51:08,545 --> 00:51:13,627
What folks, Matu and Gina, you're trying to do here. I think that's fantastic.

813
00:51:13,627 --> 00:51:13,907
Yeah, thank you.

814
00:51:13,907 --> 00:51:20,009
So again, thank you so much for coming out today to have this talk.

815
00:51:20,009 --> 00:51:25,952
Thank you to the GDC audience for watching us. And please enjoy the rest of your show.

816
00:51:27,752 --> 00:51:29,155
Thank you. Thanks, everybody.

817
00:51:29,155 --> 00:51:31,279
Thank you. And thank you, Gina.

818
00:51:31,279 --> 00:51:33,363
Great to have you at your first GDC.

819
00:51:33,363 --> 00:51:34,365
Thank you. Thank you.

820
00:51:34,365 --> 00:51:35,428
All right. Take care.
