00:00:11,472 --> 00:00:17,116
Hi, everyone. We're really nice and on the sides here. Thanks for joining me this morning.

2
00:00:18,758 --> 00:00:24,382
And super, super excited to be at GDC. So this talk is lessons from D'Alingo from startup

3
00:00:24,422 --> 00:00:25,102
to IPO.

4
00:00:26,284 --> 00:00:28,305
And there's actually a lot to get through today.

5
00:00:28,385 --> 00:00:29,825
So let me first tell you about what Duolingo is,

6
00:00:29,845 --> 00:00:31,826
and then I'll tell you why I'm here to talk with you about it.

7
00:00:33,387 --> 00:00:36,108
So Duolingo, if you're here, hopefully you know what it is.

8
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:38,088
It's the most downloaded education app

9
00:00:38,108 --> 00:00:40,969
with over 42 million monthly active learners.

10
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:45,051
And it was designed to make language learning feel like a game.

11
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:47,952
We got inspiration from games, from game creators like you,

12
00:00:48,412 --> 00:00:50,853
on how to make learning as fun as possible.

13
00:00:51,673 --> 00:00:55,215
We launched in June of 2012, almost a decade ago,

14
00:00:55,936 --> 00:00:58,017
and we IPO-ed last summer,

15
00:00:58,457 --> 00:01:00,879
which is a really, really exciting experience.

16
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,301
So who am I? Why am I here talking with you about this?

17
00:01:04,642 --> 00:01:05,402
My name is Karen.

18
00:01:06,143 --> 00:01:09,285
I have a background in computer science and neuroscience,

19
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:11,946
and I had the pleasure of being with Duolingo

20
00:01:11,986 --> 00:01:14,668
since three months after its launch in June of 2012.

21
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:20,154
So I started as a brand new, bright-eyed, bushy-tailed software engineer,

22
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:22,898
now a senior director of engineering.

23
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:26,923
And I love coming to GDC because, one, I love games.

24
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,966
Duolingo has been inspired through games throughout time,

25
00:01:29,326 --> 00:01:33,351
but I think game-adjacent industries have a lot to also sort of offer and learn and share

26
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:34,513
with the game industry.

27
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:39,747
So I've been to GDC before twice.

28
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:42,169
In 2019, we gave a talk on how to make learning hard things

29
00:01:42,309 --> 00:01:44,831
easy using data from Duolingo.

30
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,634
In summer of 2020, we talked about sort of

31
00:01:47,694 --> 00:01:49,996
our A-B testing framework and how to turn good intentions

32
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:50,657
into good numbers.

33
00:01:51,357 --> 00:01:54,580
Was really sad to miss 2021 due to COVID and such,

34
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,642
but so thrilled to be back here in person with you all.

35
00:01:57,349 --> 00:01:57,830
in 2022.

36
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:02,193
And what I like to share every time I come to GDC

37
00:02:02,313 --> 00:02:03,795
is my current obsession with games.

38
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,656
It is currently Final Fantasy XIV.

39
00:02:06,337 --> 00:02:08,919
So if you play this game or want to talk about it for hours,

40
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,400
please talk to me after.

41
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:13,943
OK, so for today's talk, really wanted

42
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:17,025
to reflect on what I thought were important decisions I've

43
00:02:17,066 --> 00:02:18,907
observed through witnessing Duolingo's journey

44
00:02:19,187 --> 00:02:21,970
from tiny, tiny startup of about 15 people 10 years ago

45
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,952
to now a sustainable company of over 500 employees.

46
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:26,453
So that's 10 years of.

47
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:30,616
worth of learning to try to cram into less than an hour's worth of time.

48
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:34,398
We have a smaller group here, so I definitely want to leave time for discussion afterwards.

49
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:36,379
So we're going to go pretty fast.

50
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,360
I like to slow down during presentations, but today we're just going to go.

51
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,022
Lots of bullets, lots of topics.

52
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:45,344
We're going to talk about people and hiring and early hiring decisions,

53
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:49,506
business strategy early on, prioritization, organizational structure

54
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,287
and some key processes that helped us.

55
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:53,708
And finally, some anticipated growing pains.

56
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,284
Honestly, I ended up hiding like 10 slides this morning

57
00:02:58,304 --> 00:02:59,445
because I was like, this is way too much.

58
00:02:59,566 --> 00:03:02,310
But if you're interested in sort of more processes we have as well,

59
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,893
the slides will be available after this talk.

60
00:03:06,055 --> 00:03:08,519
So don't stress too much about writing everything down or taking notes.

61
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:09,901
I'm happy to share the slides with you.

62
00:03:11,172 --> 00:03:19,397
All right, first, some disclaimers that hopefully should be fairly obvious is there is absolutely no playbook for how to be a successful startup.

63
00:03:19,477 --> 00:03:21,939
If there was one, it would be a much easier journey.

64
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,123
We came in at Dolingo with a lot of advantages and had a ton of luck along the way.

65
00:03:28,143 --> 00:03:33,127
For example, our CEO already had a good track record, so funding was probably a little easier for us.

66
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:36,729
We managed to hire and retain really excellent people.

67
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:39,711
And the market is very different today than it was 10 years ago.

68
00:03:40,632 --> 00:03:41,932
And some really lucky things happened.

69
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:45,053
So our owl mascot became an internet meme sensation.

70
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:47,634
Usage soared throughout COVID as people looked

71
00:03:47,654 --> 00:03:49,175
for productive things to do with their time.

72
00:03:50,275 --> 00:03:52,256
So we got really lucky in many ways.

73
00:03:53,136 --> 00:03:55,397
So all this to say the goal of today's talk

74
00:03:55,617 --> 00:03:58,158
is to describe what happened along the way

75
00:03:58,298 --> 00:03:59,978
of a single company's journey.

76
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:02,559
And it's not meant to be prescriptive

77
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,580
because different things will work for different companies,

78
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,601
but it will aim to be generalizable.

79
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:12,605
So the main takeaway I want you all to take from this talk today is not necessarily what to do or

80
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:17,409
what to copy in terms of what we ended up doing, but more what were the problems that we encountered

81
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:22,434
along the way and how might you be able to proactively address them within your own environments.

82
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:25,739
All right, we're gonna jump right into people.

83
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,340
So when you start at a company,

84
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,441
and I guess maybe just for my own reference

85
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:31,823
and show of hands, who here is in leadership

86
00:04:31,863 --> 00:04:33,664
or management at their companies?

87
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:35,045
Perfect, perfect.

88
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,126
How many of you are in companies

89
00:04:36,146 --> 00:04:37,787
that are 50 people or less?

90
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:40,508
Okay, cool, cool, awesome.

91
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:42,970
And how many of you are here

92
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,331
just because you're either a Duolingo fan

93
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:46,392
or you feared our all mascot would come after you

94
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,673
if you didn't come to this talk?

95
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:48,894
Okay, just me, cool.

96
00:04:50,200 --> 00:05:10,537
Great. So people when you start a company and many of you are at small companies, you have very, very limited resources, as you know, and even as you grow, like even with us at 500 people now, there will never be enough employees to cover everything that you want to do. So we focused really heavily early on on growing our talent pool very carefully and honestly quite slowly and making sure we were making the most

97
00:05:11,044 --> 00:05:14,788
of the people we had and putting them in places where they can have the highest impact and

98
00:05:14,828 --> 00:05:15,349
succeed.

99
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,674
So, early hiring, just have a few bullet points of things we sort of observed and learned

100
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:21,175
over time.

101
00:05:22,232 --> 00:05:25,173
For early employees, we found that generalists

102
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:26,713
are super, super important.

103
00:05:27,113 --> 00:05:29,294
In the beginning, people need to wear so many hats.

104
00:05:30,174 --> 00:05:32,595
Product, QA, engineering, even design.

105
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:36,095
And also to have a high level of independence

106
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:38,136
because you just aren't going to have a ton of senior leaders

107
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:39,536
to go around managing people.

108
00:05:40,036 --> 00:05:41,917
So we only really started specializing more

109
00:05:41,997 --> 00:05:44,657
and hiring more specialized talent much, much later.

110
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:45,778
And later in this presentation,

111
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:47,578
I'll sort of show a timeline of when we hired

112
00:05:48,058 --> 00:05:49,478
certain key roles to give you a sense of

113
00:05:49,498 --> 00:05:51,679
how scrappy we were able to be at the beginning.

114
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,004
Relatedly, it's really hard to find perfect hires at the start.

115
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:59,990
You need to find people who are passionate about what you do and willing to take the

116
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,113
risk to go along for the ride with you.

117
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:05,597
So you have to get really good at identifying potential.

118
00:06:06,438 --> 00:06:09,262
You know, it will be really hard to find a resume of this person has taken a startup

119
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:09,442
from.

120
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:12,184
zero to 100 and you can hire this person.

121
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:15,366
But the thing is, if you find someone

122
00:06:15,786 --> 00:06:17,547
who has an incredible growth trajectory,

123
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:20,289
invest in them a ton, I mean a ton.

124
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:22,450
Give them opportunities because they will grow

125
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,131
into someone you probably could not have hired.

126
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,893
And I think if you are someone

127
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:29,594
who maybe is not a leadership manager,

128
00:06:29,794 --> 00:06:32,275
be this person, really try to be this person.

129
00:06:32,856 --> 00:06:34,436
It will pay dividends for sure.

130
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:42,375
The other thing I want to highlight here is that early diversity makes it so much easier to maintain diversity and grow it.

131
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:49,977
We found that having a diverse team early on made it so much easier to continue hiring diverse talent and being appealing to diverse candidates.

132
00:06:50,317 --> 00:06:53,958
And injecting diversity after the fact is always going to be so much harder.

133
00:06:54,058 --> 00:07:00,840
So keeping this in mind when building your team is what do you want your team to look like and how do you want it to represent your user base going forward as well.

134
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,943
And finally, this is potentially a controversial point,

135
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,245
but this is something that we did early on

136
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:09,607
that I actually think was somewhat of a mistake for us

137
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:10,848
that we got better at.

138
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:12,950
Is we basically, we are a tech company,

139
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,731
we should have internships.

140
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:15,452
Great, internships are fun,

141
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:17,353
but we originally looked at it as like a,

142
00:07:17,474 --> 00:07:19,455
hey, maybe, and we did paid internships, of course,

143
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:20,336
but we thought, you know,

144
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,697
maybe we could just get some extra resources

145
00:07:21,737 --> 00:07:22,878
for a summer, et cetera.

146
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:23,318
Great.

147
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:26,621
We found as we, it turned out to be a little better

148
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:28,582
for us to prioritize internships as a hiring funnel.

149
00:07:29,723 --> 00:07:32,205
and really invest in full-time hires of our interns,

150
00:07:32,265 --> 00:07:35,087
at least early on until you produce the sort of slack

151
00:07:35,127 --> 00:07:38,310
to be able to not have to ruthlessly prioritize as much.

152
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,072
So originally, right, we made internship programs

153
00:07:41,092 --> 00:07:43,134
because we wanted to offer the opportunity, et cetera,

154
00:07:43,174 --> 00:07:45,255
but then we had to really prioritize

155
00:07:45,816 --> 00:07:49,358
our senior engineers' time in mentoring and training interns

156
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:53,381
and interns were fantastic if you invest in them

157
00:07:53,441 --> 00:07:54,983
for converting to full-time hires.

158
00:07:55,303 --> 00:07:56,444
So that's what we had focused on.

159
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:06,262
Similarly to I think there is a fantastic place for contractors freelancers. They are wonderful. But we also early on really

160
00:08:06,342 --> 00:08:12,387
focused on trying to hire full time as much as possible so that we could invest very heavily in our early employees.

161
00:08:13,788 --> 00:08:19,133
Contractors are fantastic for well scoped isolated straightforward projects that have easy handoff but very early in a

162
00:08:19,193 --> 00:08:21,415
company we found there were a ton of projects like that.

163
00:08:22,563 --> 00:08:27,217
And we needed someone who could sort of own knowledge and become knowledge experts over

164
00:08:27,278 --> 00:08:28,882
time for years to come.

165
00:08:30,503 --> 00:08:32,745
Similarly, when it comes to shaping your team,

166
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:34,727
there are a few things we encountered along the way,

167
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,488
you might already be experiencing it,

168
00:08:36,628 --> 00:08:39,371
is the hiring bar needs to remain super high

169
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:42,753
and there will absolutely always be pressure to move it down.

170
00:08:44,074 --> 00:08:45,456
So make sure you have bar setters

171
00:08:45,696 --> 00:08:47,637
and reward them for being bar setters.

172
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:50,259
Making sure that you're not compromising

173
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:53,382
because it is so, so costly to have hired the wrong person,

174
00:08:53,942 --> 00:08:54,743
super, super important.

175
00:08:55,544 --> 00:08:58,485
And similarly, if it'll take six months to hire for a role,

176
00:08:58,525 --> 00:09:00,387
make sure you look around and see if you can grow someone

177
00:09:00,427 --> 00:09:01,667
into it within six months.

178
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,829
Seems obvious in retrospect, but you know,

179
00:09:04,849 --> 00:09:06,891
looking around you and having someone grow into that role

180
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:09,412
is oftentimes one of your best bets.

181
00:09:09,952 --> 00:09:11,333
We did this very frequently.

182
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:12,694
We had people even swap roles.

183
00:09:12,734 --> 00:09:14,675
Like I think we had someone convert to a PM

184
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:16,636
who was originally a marketing intern

185
00:09:17,237 --> 00:09:18,117
because he was fantastic.

186
00:09:18,337 --> 00:09:20,399
And these things worked out super well for us.

187
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:24,387
Other thing to sort of suggest is,

188
00:09:24,807 --> 00:09:27,668
I think we tend to focus a lot on sort of the hiring funnel.

189
00:09:27,688 --> 00:09:29,409
How can we get as many applications as possible?

190
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:31,569
How can we be appealing to new hires?

191
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,471
One thing to note is just a good employee retained

192
00:09:34,971 --> 00:09:36,932
can be a lot better than actually being able

193
00:09:36,972 --> 00:09:37,792
to hire someone.

194
00:09:37,832 --> 00:09:40,113
So a lot of companies focus on competing for talent,

195
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:43,314
but they sort of neglect addressing turnover

196
00:09:43,354 --> 00:09:44,394
or reducing turnover.

197
00:09:44,915 --> 00:09:46,435
But if you don't lose someone,

198
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:48,096
that means you don't have to hire someone else.

199
00:09:48,196 --> 00:09:51,317
So in some ways, it's a very, very high ROI investment.

200
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,741
And also long term employees, like I said, have deep institutional knowledge and help persist culture.

201
00:09:56,941 --> 00:10:00,845
So invest in both internally and externally when it comes to building your teams.

202
00:10:02,426 --> 00:10:19,640
At the same time, this is something that I think Duolingo has gotten better at, but was really hard is if you do manage to hire really amazing industry hires, giving them space to sort of innovate and to challenge the status quo and be accepting of change, I think is super, super important when it came to building our team early on.

203
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:23,567
And then finally, incentives should align

204
00:10:23,607 --> 00:10:24,827
with what you want people to do.

205
00:10:25,607 --> 00:10:28,028
Again, these things said out loud, I think seem obvious,

206
00:10:28,068 --> 00:10:30,608
but one of the things we realized is career growth,

207
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,509
compensation, recognition, et cetera,

208
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:34,009
really needs to align well

209
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:37,410
with what you actually want people to prioritize doing.

210
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,891
And that includes hiring and interviewing

211
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,671
and building teams and persisting culture.

212
00:10:42,731 --> 00:10:45,032
So make sure that the sort of invisible work

213
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:46,372
that is important to your company

214
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,013
becomes visible over time.

215
00:10:49,908 --> 00:10:55,851
Great. And so this is my favorite quote when it comes to people from our awesome CEO Louis Fanon.

216
00:10:56,872 --> 00:11:00,794
This is a principle we abided by for a very long time and still abide by at Dolingo.

217
00:11:01,094 --> 00:11:04,316
It is better to have a hole than an a-hole is what Louis said.

218
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:12,240
We at times waited on key hires until we found the right person even if we suffered in the absence of that role.

219
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:15,522
And at times we waited over a year to hire those key hires.

220
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,663
But we have never ever regretted waiting.

221
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:21,538
So this is simply advice to have at the beginning is it's going to be very

222
00:11:21,638 --> 00:11:24,400
tempting to say, well, this person's probably good enough or this person kind

223
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,862
of doesn't fit with the vibe or the culture we want, but they're really

224
00:11:27,902 --> 00:11:31,885
accomplished. We've been able to resist that and we've never regretted it.

225
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:33,906
So keep this quote in mind.

226
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:46,795
Great. All right. So let's talk a business of strategy and this will be like the meatier part of this talk is the sort of way that we approached strategy going forward with with limited resources.

227
00:11:48,436 --> 00:12:03,122
Early key decisions is and this is hopefully familiar with this audience is we bet on making a mobile app about 10 years ago and rode that wave with the rise of mobile apps and this is very sort of analogous with the rise of free to play over boxed products.

228
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:04,703
over time in the games.

229
00:12:05,464 --> 00:12:07,285
At the time, language learning was very much

230
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:11,548
a sort of you attend classes, or you learn it on a CD, et cetera.

231
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:13,850
And we kind of had to make the risky bet of saying,

232
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,792
what if we made an app?

233
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:17,853
People were saying at the time, you cannot learn

234
00:12:17,913 --> 00:12:18,634
through technology.

235
00:12:18,794 --> 00:12:20,715
But that's what we wanted to do.

236
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:23,758
So at the start and rise of mobile apps,

237
00:12:24,258 --> 00:12:25,839
we decided we're going to invest in iOS,

238
00:12:25,859 --> 00:12:26,760
we're going to invest in Android,

239
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,961
and we're going to have it so that you can learn

240
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:28,822
a language on your phone.

241
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:39,525
And so the thing to sort of always ask yourself because I think this was actually the most critical part to our success is what will that next wave look like and will you catch it or be left behind.

242
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:44,429
I've attended a lot of NFT talks here so we will see if that is the next wave.

243
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,613
So the other thing that we decided to do really early on is to not try to do everything at once.

244
00:12:51,653 --> 00:12:54,154
And this is very, very hard to do because you're going to have naysayers.

245
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,035
You're going to have people who are pushing you to work on everything.

246
00:12:57,055 --> 00:13:01,077
And we very intentionally decided to focus first on user growth.

247
00:13:01,617 --> 00:13:03,258
And then we added monetization.

248
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,920
And then we decided to invest in longer term bets like our learning efficacy over time.

249
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,461
And then philanthropy in that order.

250
00:13:11,421 --> 00:13:14,022
And we're going to focus a little bit more on these first two, user growth and monetization,

251
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:16,303
because I think they'll be most relevant for this group here.

252
00:13:17,683 --> 00:13:20,945
The other thing that we did very early on is we invested in data a lot.

253
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:25,186
A-B testing drove all of our decision making and allowed us to move very quickly.

254
00:13:25,206 --> 00:13:29,668
Adil and I will talk a little bit more about experimentation going forward as well.

255
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,551
So let's talk about growth stage first.

256
00:13:32,631 --> 00:13:35,674
So we decided that we wanted to focus on building the most

257
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:39,297
engaging learning product we could and ramp up our user base

258
00:13:39,838 --> 00:13:40,698
as soon as possible.

259
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,522
And I will say we did this at the cost of not monetizing

260
00:13:44,622 --> 00:13:44,862
early.

261
00:13:45,262 --> 00:13:48,745
and also honestly not focusing on learning efficacy very early.

262
00:13:48,945 --> 00:13:50,466
And there was a lot of criticism about this.

263
00:13:51,087 --> 00:13:53,989
But here is our logic is the more users we had,

264
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:57,632
the faster our sort of experiments can resolve

265
00:13:57,692 --> 00:13:59,813
in terms of statistical significance and the data we get

266
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:01,635
from what makes an engaging product,

267
00:14:02,115 --> 00:14:04,757
the faster we can iterate, the better product we can build,

268
00:14:05,257 --> 00:14:06,338
and then the more users would come

269
00:14:06,518 --> 00:14:07,619
because we had a great product.

270
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:19,083
I think this flywheel was by far the most powerful thing that drove Duolingo to its success in the early days is we simply had more people than anyone else did and we could learn so quickly and iterate so quickly on our product.

271
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:27,965
We could provide our services for free attract a large audience and then we could bet that before we run out of runway we could monetize quickly enough.

272
00:14:29,705 --> 00:14:36,827
So the question is to sort of ask to is our moat was the number of learners we had and as well as a very sophisticated A.B. testing framework.

273
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:39,091
And the question to ask is then,

274
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,936
what are the moats that you want to invest in?

275
00:14:40,976 --> 00:14:42,761
Like what gives you that competitive edge

276
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,749
in the market at your stage of startup as well?

277
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:50,014
The other thing that we wanted to make sure of

278
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:52,456
is to stay ahead of the curve when it came to product.

279
00:14:52,576 --> 00:14:54,757
We decided that we were going to be our own competitors

280
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:56,859
and try to innovate in this space.

281
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:00,121
So for example, over time we've done several redesigns

282
00:15:00,181 --> 00:15:03,104
of Duolingo and sometimes had to pause our feature freeze

283
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:06,226
to say we're doing all hands on deck to update our product,

284
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:09,288
update all of our assets so the app never felt too old.

285
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:12,411
And this was a perfect time also to clean up technical debt,

286
00:15:12,451 --> 00:15:15,333
to clean up product debt, to clean up product complexity.

287
00:15:16,054 --> 00:15:19,002
and was something that we definitely invested in a lot over time.

288
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:23,912
So I wasn't kidding when we said we do a lot of experiments.

289
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:26,094
This is the number of experiments

290
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,555
we create a month at Duolingo.

291
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:30,757
You can see it's hovering around or near 300 experiments a month.

292
00:15:30,777 --> 00:15:32,658
That's like 10 a day that we run.

293
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:34,899
And when I say experiment, it's things like as simple

294
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:36,701
as let me change the copy on this button

295
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:38,722
and see what results in my click-through rate,

296
00:15:39,342 --> 00:15:41,163
all the way to this is a whole new feature

297
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:43,145
that we're going to A, B test and slowly roll out.

298
00:15:44,425 --> 00:15:47,928
And we are able to do this because our user growth,

299
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:50,009
this is our monthly active users over time.

300
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,050
You can see we get spikes on New Year's because of New Year's resolutions.

301
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,911
These two graphs are very similar, right?

302
00:15:55,151 --> 00:15:58,592
We can run a lot more experiments with more learners that we have.

303
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:02,854
And also, running more experiments allowed us to make a better product that retained

304
00:16:02,894 --> 00:16:04,775
and attracted learners over time.

305
00:16:05,455 --> 00:16:07,316
So this is the sort of power of our flywheel.

306
00:16:07,436 --> 00:16:11,157
And after we accomplished a massive number of learners, we paused and said, OK, well,

307
00:16:11,677 --> 00:16:14,519
how do we survive as a company now in terms of monetization?

308
00:16:16,415 --> 00:16:18,196
So stage two, monetization.

309
00:16:18,256 --> 00:16:19,636
Now that we had a ton of users, we

310
00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:22,337
could have the privilege of turning a switch,

311
00:16:22,757 --> 00:16:24,718
kind of to start monetizing and extend our runway.

312
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:26,739
So the way that we approached this

313
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,160
is it was honestly really hard.

314
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,560
We started with ads.

315
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,521
Honestly, we didn't like ads.

316
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:33,922
We really liked having a very clean product.

317
00:16:33,982 --> 00:16:36,343
But we started with ads because we decided, hey,

318
00:16:36,884 --> 00:16:38,884
this will buy us runway to figure out a longer term bet.

319
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:42,086
And that longer term bet was a subscription model.

320
00:16:42,146 --> 00:16:44,427
So Duolingo monetizes through a subscription

321
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:45,247
that gives you some perks.

322
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:53,589
And ever since our subscription model, we started also explaining the potential of in-game currencies and in-app purchases also inspired by games.

323
00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:59,077
So the other thing that we also added in was starting to bet on new verticals.

324
00:16:59,117 --> 00:17:01,518
So this is the order we did things as we did ads, we did subscriptions,

325
00:17:01,738 --> 00:17:03,478
we're investing in in-game economies now,

326
00:17:03,838 --> 00:17:06,979
and we also are investing in new verticals to monetize at Dolingo as well.

327
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:10,800
So this is the breakdown right now, as of I think a few months ago,

328
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,040
in terms of where our revenue comes from.

329
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,401
You can see it's dominated by subscriptions.

330
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:19,722
But the other sort of assets you see ads started out being everything

331
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:22,642
and then just shrunk to 15 percent, which we're quite happy about.

332
00:17:24,984 --> 00:17:27,247
So a few things learned along the way from monetization.

333
00:17:28,568 --> 00:17:31,031
Because we were such a driven mission driven company at first

334
00:17:31,071 --> 00:17:33,674
and people who joined Duolingo early on really just believed

335
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:35,676
in that mission of free education.

336
00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:39,561
We had to do a lot of work to align our business objectives

337
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:40,302
with that mission.

338
00:17:40,742 --> 00:17:43,845
Without that alignment, there was no passion for the product.

339
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:48,128
And one of the hardest things we had to do was honestly convince ourselves making money wasn't evil.

340
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:50,570
And I'm not kidding when this took several months.

341
00:17:51,651 --> 00:17:54,033
There was a lot of people who thought we would simply dilute our mission

342
00:17:54,153 --> 00:17:57,416
or stop caring about our product once we started monetizing.

343
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:09,872
And I think the only way we were able to really combat that both externally and internally is to really, really stay true to being an authentic and mission driven brand and saying, we're going to need money if we want to win in this space.

344
00:18:09,892 --> 00:18:11,755
And if we win in this space, it's going to be good for the world.

345
00:18:13,357 --> 00:18:15,298
So we had to convince our employees.

346
00:18:15,318 --> 00:18:18,440
We had a lot of like sort of open discussions and forums about it.

347
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,721
We listened to concerns.

348
00:18:20,241 --> 00:18:22,323
I was I was still suffering during your time.

349
00:18:22,363 --> 00:18:23,743
I wasn't even leadership and management.

350
00:18:23,763 --> 00:18:25,504
So I still remember this kind of from both sides.

351
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:27,646
And we did it.

352
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:31,028
And I think one of the things we also did was we wrote down our monetization

353
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:34,470
principles to sort of say everyone should always be able to learn for free

354
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,290
on Duolingo.

355
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,891
We're never going to get anyone with money.

356
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:40,533
And I think that guiding principle is still about one that we hold today.

357
00:18:42,523 --> 00:18:44,987
Our user base loyalty was very high at the time.

358
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:48,753
I think it's important to sort of demonstrate your mission and not just say it.

359
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:53,701
And it played a really critical role in how accepting people were when we started monetizing.

360
00:18:54,514 --> 00:19:03,020
And I think one of the affirmations for that is once we released our subscription, you know, it came with perks like you can download your lessons offline, you get, I don't know, some cute like skins for the duo, etc.

361
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,983
The number one reason people subscribe was to support the mission of free education.

362
00:19:07,003 --> 00:19:12,647
And I think that was saying a lot in how we branded our monetization and how our intentions were made clear to our learners.

363
00:19:14,478 --> 00:19:20,541
All right. So then we monetized. We decided we were going to keep living as a startup. And this stage I won't spend too

364
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:25,964
much time on learning efficacy is maybe not that applicable to games. But the reason I'm bringing it up here is this was

365
00:19:26,004 --> 00:19:31,386
the stage after monetization that we decided to to really invest in longer term bets.

366
00:19:32,467 --> 00:19:35,631
And we decided to start investing heavily in measuring learning,

367
00:19:35,691 --> 00:19:38,074
measuring efficacy, doing curriculum overhauls,

368
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:44,021
because we needed to fulfill the promise of actually teaching

369
00:19:44,061 --> 00:19:44,962
you a language, right?

370
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:46,003
We didn't want to be a scam.

371
00:19:46,023 --> 00:19:48,286
We didn't want to be a place where people only

372
00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:49,888
went to casually learn a language

373
00:19:49,928 --> 00:19:50,769
and then stop forever.

374
00:19:52,390 --> 00:20:07,276
What this taught us was actually that some things are not measurable and this was something that was hard for us to learn is as such a data driven 300 experiment per month company we had to learn that there was a huge important aspect of D'Alingo that we would just never be able to really A.V. test well.

375
00:20:07,496 --> 00:20:11,578
So we had this conversion in this sort of renaissance within the company that we.

376
00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:17,463
needed to stop saying every experiment needed to win and increase metrics and instead started shifting to

377
00:20:17,964 --> 00:20:22,809
let us increase pedagogical value based on the experts who know how to teach a language

378
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:28,074
and let us simply try not to hurt our gargoyle metrics. We went from neutral experiments are good

379
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,778
if we are increasing the efficacy of our product.

380
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:43,781
So the reason we invested in all of this was and the take I want you to take from the section is we knew that learning based initiatives would increase the cap of where we could be three years from now.

381
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:51,486
You know we would hit a hard wall on growth or a hard wall on monetization if we were never able to extend how far we can get you in learning a language.

382
00:20:52,246 --> 00:20:56,190
So the question to ask yourself is what will you be limited by three years from now.

383
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,454
What do you think the cap will be in terms of potential of your product and what can you work on today to uncap.

384
00:21:01,835 --> 00:21:07,159
And we decided after we had enough learners after we decided we could be sustainable as a company.

385
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,601
This was our cap was learning efficacy.

386
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:14,371
And then finally, fourth stage that we're still expanding on

387
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:15,672
is innovation and philanthropy.

388
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,554
Not saying innovation can't be there at the beginning,

389
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:20,536
but sort of risky boulder bets in innovation,

390
00:21:20,576 --> 00:21:22,438
I think you get more slack to do

391
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:24,960
once you're sort of out of the, in the clear.

392
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,202
So we started investing in in-house technologies

393
00:21:27,242 --> 00:21:28,263
and tools at this stage.

394
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:31,165
And note that we didn't do it earlier than this stage.

395
00:21:31,205 --> 00:21:33,126
So we have our in-house analytics framework,

396
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:34,848
internal tools for curriculum creation,

397
00:21:34,888 --> 00:21:35,909
custom speech recognition.

398
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:42,754
etc. But the main advice here is to not reinvent the wheel too early. So use existing stuff if

399
00:21:42,814 --> 00:21:47,979
it's available because the time of your team is the most valuable thing you have right now.

400
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:51,582
And build internally only when it breaks or if you've outgrown it.

401
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:54,123
Also new verticals, bold bets.

402
00:21:54,464 --> 00:21:55,725
We had several new verticals.

403
00:21:55,945 --> 00:21:56,985
We failed at most of them.

404
00:21:57,105 --> 00:21:58,446
We succeeded in a few of them.

405
00:21:59,567 --> 00:22:01,208
So we did language certification, literacy,

406
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:02,569
kids, math, flashcards.

407
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:04,350
Some of these succeeded, some of these did not.

408
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:07,332
And I guess one slight point of guidance,

409
00:22:07,372 --> 00:22:08,733
and this might be different for your companies,

410
00:22:08,813 --> 00:22:12,096
is we decided to invest about 70% in optimization

411
00:22:12,116 --> 00:22:13,857
and the things that we know would get us gains

412
00:22:14,397 --> 00:22:16,178
in building the machine, in running the machine,

413
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,400
and about 30% in R&D and innovation and exploration,

414
00:22:19,441 --> 00:22:21,842
and we try to design our teams such that that is true.

415
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:24,802
So a few learnings.

416
00:22:25,322 --> 00:22:27,764
It's really, really easy to go overboard and say,

417
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,566
it's really, really hard to say no to philanthropic things.

418
00:22:30,606 --> 00:22:32,568
When someone says like, hey, we should do this,

419
00:22:33,028 --> 00:22:35,010
you don't want to say no if it's a good thing to do,

420
00:22:35,971 --> 00:22:37,572
especially with a very passionate employee base.

421
00:22:38,032 --> 00:22:40,254
But the advice I'd give, especially when you're small,

422
00:22:40,294 --> 00:22:43,036
is to focus on the impact you're best at making.

423
00:22:43,316 --> 00:22:46,579
So for Duolingo, it was that we were uniquely positioned

424
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,261
to do things like support the addition of underrepresented

425
00:22:49,281 --> 00:22:50,902
or endangered languages on our platform.

426
00:22:51,924 --> 00:22:54,165
But one of my favorite quotes from our CFO is like,

427
00:22:54,465 --> 00:22:57,085
we like the whales, but we shouldn't focus on saving the whales.

428
00:22:57,285 --> 00:23:01,706
And I think that is a sign of Duolingo is not in a position to really go and

429
00:23:01,727 --> 00:23:03,407
try to save the whales or

430
00:23:03,447 --> 00:23:07,268
do a lot of other things that weren't directly related to our company.

431
00:23:07,288 --> 00:23:10,749
So really focusing on the things that you can have unique leverage on will help you

432
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:11,269
kind of scope.

433
00:23:14,217 --> 00:23:14,897
Relatedly, right?

434
00:23:15,117 --> 00:23:15,898
Prioritization.

435
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:18,379
So making the most of the resources

436
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:20,800
you have at this early stage, which many of you are at,

437
00:23:22,021 --> 00:23:23,522
is probably one of the most important things you could do.

438
00:23:23,922 --> 00:23:25,603
Though the strategy I just described

439
00:23:25,963 --> 00:23:27,504
already defines what you prioritize,

440
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,606
there are a few other things we learned along the way.

441
00:23:30,987 --> 00:23:35,971
So early on the best advice that I got from Luis was to realize the value of my time,

442
00:23:36,091 --> 00:23:37,913
even as a very, very junior engineer.

443
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:40,435
And I remember this story from when I started at Duolingo,

444
00:23:40,475 --> 00:23:43,418
as I was, I think I was just like mad at someone on the internet or something,

445
00:23:43,678 --> 00:23:44,880
saying something wrong about Duolingo.

446
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,403
And he said, you know, if every employee had a share,

447
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:52,146
every employee has a share of like 100,000 users to take care of,

448
00:23:52,527 --> 00:23:55,770
whatever you decide to work on every minute of your day, think about.

449
00:23:56,745 --> 00:23:58,866
those 100,000 users that are in your care.

450
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:01,868
And that helped me really understand

451
00:24:01,888 --> 00:24:04,549
the opportunity costs that comes from going down rabbit holes

452
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,371
and what I'd be sacrificing to go down those holes.

453
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:12,854
So training this mindset in all of the early employee base,

454
00:24:12,894 --> 00:24:15,356
I think, was super, super useful for helping to protect us

455
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:19,418
from ourselves and investing in lower ROI work

456
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:22,300
so that we can maximize our impact as a very small team.

457
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,602
this sort of philosophy will just make a lean work first go a really long way for you and stay focused.

458
00:24:29,423 --> 00:24:45,071
The other thing, and this is like a quote you don't have to read fully, but the TLDR is, you know, one thing that we learned also is as a small t is very easy to sort of like go down the Reddit rabbit hole or read an article about your product or get really angry at people who are wrong on the Internet.

459
00:24:46,332 --> 00:24:50,514
But one thing that we found is we were listening to channels that

460
00:24:50,554 --> 00:24:53,455
represented just a very, very small portion of our user base.

461
00:24:53,856 --> 00:24:55,757
And that's not to say you shouldn't listen to your users.

462
00:24:55,797 --> 00:24:57,938
I think this quote is a bit strong.

463
00:24:58,518 --> 00:25:01,640
But one thing to recognize is making sure you're actually listening to your users

464
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,401
and not just listening to a few of your users.

465
00:25:05,842 --> 00:25:08,644
So we had to really, really take user feedback with a grain of salt.

466
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:13,470
And what we decided to do is we tried to listen to our users through data and

467
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:16,614
their usage instead of directly through qualitative comments.

468
00:25:17,655 --> 00:25:21,260
A few caveats here is I 100% believe in user experience research.

469
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,504
I think UXR is fantastic and it is absolutely necessary.

470
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,386
Qualitative feedback is really important.

471
00:25:26,827 --> 00:25:30,631
But the type of sort of feedback that we didn't find as useful early on was was

472
00:25:31,011 --> 00:25:33,093
things that are not conducted by professionals, right?

473
00:25:33,113 --> 00:25:36,617
Like an engineer, me reading on Reddit that someone is mad at the product

474
00:25:38,058 --> 00:25:42,102
that tended to just really be red herrings to the actual underlying problems.

475
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:43,844
So thick skin helps.

476
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:48,148
You know, remember, it's the most upset people that tend to be the most vocal.

477
00:25:48,208 --> 00:25:48,589
And I think.

478
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:52,251
Looking at our data and saying, actually the vast majority of our learners really

479
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:56,835
love the redesign we just did versus reading the really long thread about how

480
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:59,156
many people hated our redesign was affirming.

481
00:25:59,216 --> 00:26:04,140
So try to use data to really get a clear sense of what the average user

482
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,821
on your product is feeling.

483
00:26:07,636 --> 00:26:13,180
Another learning about prioritization is it is so, so, so tempting to sort of greed and

484
00:26:13,601 --> 00:26:17,344
try to scale a product or feature out before you're confident there's product market fit.

485
00:26:17,384 --> 00:26:19,606
So how this looks at Duolingo is we'll come up with a feature.

486
00:26:19,947 --> 00:26:20,387
We love it.

487
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:21,228
It's great.

488
00:26:21,728 --> 00:26:23,249
We'll launch it on iOS first.

489
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:23,770
We'll test it.

490
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,350
It looks great.

491
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:29,095
And then we'll immediately want to say, let's get more learners using this feature by having

492
00:26:29,135 --> 00:26:30,656
it on like web and Android immediately.

493
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:37,660
And one of the things that does is it's the case that it really actually slows down iteration on that.

494
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,063
So one of the things we've learned to do is try to be really patient with product market fit because

495
00:26:42,323 --> 00:26:45,485
you know the moment you want to make a change to that feature you now need to change it on

496
00:26:45,526 --> 00:26:48,427
three different platforms instead of being able to scrappily prototype it on one.

497
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:53,692
So it took a lot of discipline to do this and when you don't have a lot of resources to,

498
00:26:53,973 --> 00:26:57,816
you know, that investment and having to port something three times is a lot.

499
00:26:59,098 --> 00:27:03,642
So just keep in mind, iteration is also a resource and the ability to iterate quickly

500
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,785
is also a resource you need to account for when it comes to decisions like this.

501
00:27:08,562 --> 00:27:12,326
And then the main thing here is not yet is a super,

502
00:27:12,426 --> 00:27:16,729
super strong response to both yes and no questions.

503
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,654
So we had to get so much better at saying not yet instead of no,

504
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:26,258
because honestly ideas can become viable over time.

505
00:27:26,638 --> 00:27:30,181
So the answer should never be no to an idea, but it can absolutely be not yet.

506
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:34,902
And then honestly, when it came to things like, let's do this new crazy feature,

507
00:27:34,922 --> 00:27:38,987
etc., also saying not yet instead of yes was also very powerful for us.

508
00:27:39,047 --> 00:27:44,333
So I highly encourage you to make use of the not yet, to put it in a backlog,

509
00:27:44,353 --> 00:27:48,158
to think critically about it, but to feel free to say not yet, to both yes and

510
00:27:48,178 --> 00:27:48,738
no questions.

511
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:53,250
All right, so we're going to run through organizational structure real quick.

512
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:57,892
This is kind of the evolution of how our org evolved over time.

513
00:27:59,213 --> 00:28:03,555
Early days, so we started with one huge flat team with individuals in charge of

514
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:04,515
certain metrics or projects.

515
00:28:04,535 --> 00:28:06,996
So my first day at Duolingo, I think I was employed like 15 or so.

516
00:28:08,317 --> 00:28:10,338
Luce came to my desk and said, hey, try to grow user retention.

517
00:28:10,378 --> 00:28:11,739
Like literally, I was just like a brand new engineer.

518
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:14,120
I sat at my desk, he was like, grow user retention, and he just left.

519
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,300
And then I, that was it.

520
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:20,883
So we got more sophisticated over time with our onboarding, but you know in the

521
00:28:20,903 --> 00:28:25,007
beginning we basically had projects and metrics that we were all in charge of.

522
00:28:25,688 --> 00:28:29,252
Everyone reported directly to the CEO in the early days and we had really

523
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,496
excellent people so we didn't worry too much about titles, hiring very senior

524
00:28:32,536 --> 00:28:36,240
leadership, etc. That landscape might have changed. Like I said, this is just the

525
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,381
story of how we started.

526
00:28:38,582 --> 00:28:39,823
It's not meant to be prescriptive.

527
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:42,725
But what this did allow us to do is actually set

528
00:28:42,745 --> 00:28:44,827
a very non-political foundation early on.

529
00:28:44,847 --> 00:28:47,309
People were preoccupied with their work

530
00:28:47,889 --> 00:28:49,851
and not too preoccupied with their status.

531
00:28:50,431 --> 00:28:51,712
And I think that really helped us.

532
00:28:52,753 --> 00:28:53,854
We hired our first manager,

533
00:28:53,874 --> 00:28:56,636
who's now our SVP of engineering, Natalie, my manager,

534
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:57,617
in early 2015.

535
00:28:57,757 --> 00:28:59,518
Now, if you remember, we launched in 2012.

536
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,842
Which means we had about two and a half years without managers.

537
00:29:04,362 --> 00:29:06,943
I mean, technically, I guess Luis was everyone's manager.

538
00:29:06,983 --> 00:29:10,225
But I thought, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this,

539
00:29:10,265 --> 00:29:11,245
but this is just what happened.

540
00:29:12,106 --> 00:29:13,746
And we continued to stay as flat as possible.

541
00:29:13,947 --> 00:29:16,148
So I can say this right as an engineering director,

542
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:18,609
that we really tried to not have more management

543
00:29:18,629 --> 00:29:20,029
than we needed at any given time.

544
00:29:21,012 --> 00:29:22,493
But everyone's use case is different.

545
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,536
So what I thought might be fun to share is a timeline

546
00:29:25,556 --> 00:29:26,437
of functions.

547
00:29:26,757 --> 00:29:28,319
This was fun to look up for myself

548
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:29,860
because I didn't realize this was the case.

549
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:33,063
So at the beginning, we only had design and engineering.

550
00:29:33,744 --> 00:29:36,086
I think we had one person managing our finances, things

551
00:29:36,106 --> 00:29:36,446
like that.

552
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:39,530
And then we hire a marketing person in early 2013.

553
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,171
I'll be transparent and say like,

554
00:29:41,492 --> 00:29:42,332
marketing person was great,

555
00:29:42,373 --> 00:29:44,335
but like we actually decided we didn't want to invest

556
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,236
in marketing at the time,

557
00:29:45,276 --> 00:29:47,318
so we kind of like didn't hire any more marketing people

558
00:29:47,358 --> 00:29:50,161
for a while until probably like 2017 or so.

559
00:29:50,601 --> 00:29:51,722
Hired her first PM in 2014.

560
00:29:53,384 --> 00:29:56,765
Our first manager in 2015, it was an engineering manager.

561
00:29:57,385 --> 00:29:59,926
Learning scientist, that was like the phase of learning and

562
00:30:00,106 --> 00:30:02,166
long term bet investment in 2015.

563
00:30:02,627 --> 00:30:03,907
Then there was talent acquisition HR.

564
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,648
Notice there are four years there where it was like engineers were just hiring

565
00:30:06,668 --> 00:30:08,328
engineers and designers were hiring design and

566
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,449
we didn't have people for explicit talent acquisition at the time.

567
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,973
We hired data scientists, even though we were AB test obsessed, in 2017.

568
00:30:17,053 --> 00:30:19,935
So that was five years until we hired our first data scientists.

569
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:23,638
And now we have excellent roles like program manager, technical program managers

570
00:30:23,678 --> 00:30:26,741
that we've hired in the past two to three years or so as well that really,

571
00:30:26,781 --> 00:30:28,082
really help us grease the wheels.

572
00:30:29,543 --> 00:30:32,845
So I thought this was interesting because in some ways, I think early on a company,

573
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:36,508
you feel like you really need someone, an expert in everything.

574
00:30:36,788 --> 00:30:40,091
And certainly I can assure you that getting excellent people in these roles

575
00:30:40,431 --> 00:30:41,052
is fantastic.

576
00:30:41,852 --> 00:30:43,514
But you kind of also make do with what you had.

577
00:30:43,554 --> 00:30:45,655
I mean, one of the first times I met our CEO,

578
00:30:45,696 --> 00:30:48,278
he was carrying a box of t-shirts to a tech recruiting

579
00:30:48,698 --> 00:30:49,178
conference.

580
00:30:49,218 --> 00:30:50,660
I was like, OK, this is a down-to-earth guy.

581
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,721
But we all had to basically do whatever

582
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:54,283
it took to get things done.

583
00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:57,105
And we, in some ways, hired these roles very late,

584
00:30:57,525 --> 00:30:59,267
also because we wanted to wait for the right person

585
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:01,309
to establish what that role and function should be.

586
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:03,290
And sometimes that took a long time.

587
00:31:05,006 --> 00:31:07,307
All right, so let me talk a little bit about the evolution

588
00:31:07,347 --> 00:31:08,468
of our organizational structure.

589
00:31:08,608 --> 00:31:10,589
After we just had this very flat structure for a long time,

590
00:31:10,629 --> 00:31:12,610
we introduced teams because we decided it'd be a good idea

591
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:16,532
for more than one person to work on retention or whatnot.

592
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:18,833
So we based teams around metrics, features,

593
00:31:18,873 --> 00:31:20,334
or problem spaces, and we wanted teams

594
00:31:20,354 --> 00:31:22,395
to be able to accomplish their goals pretty autonomously.

595
00:31:22,895 --> 00:31:24,556
So there are several ways to do this.

596
00:31:25,097 --> 00:31:27,178
Some people have all the iOS engineers here,

597
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,598
all the Android engineers here, et cetera.

598
00:31:28,618 --> 00:31:29,959
There's a design team, et cetera.

599
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,359
We decided to do them vertically

600
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,321
so that there were little pods of engineers and designers

601
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:36,782
and program managers and learning scientists together.

602
00:31:38,403 --> 00:31:39,803
Controversial, but we actually did this

603
00:31:39,843 --> 00:31:41,964
so we would minimize cross-team collaboration.

604
00:31:42,004 --> 00:31:42,484
I know that's like...

605
00:31:43,472 --> 00:31:47,217
Not a great thing to say, but it's because we didn't want teams to always feel blocked

606
00:31:47,497 --> 00:31:50,801
on other teams and their priorities. We wanted teams to feel like they had a sense of control

607
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:54,665
over their own destiny and success. So we decided to build teams vertically with all

608
00:31:54,685 --> 00:31:57,388
of the components they would need to be successful at accomplishing their goals.

609
00:31:58,844 --> 00:32:02,505
So our first teams were actually like learning, growth, and monetization, which if you remember

610
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:05,306
may be the sort of phases of prioritization we went through.

611
00:32:05,746 --> 00:32:09,348
And we also at this point created the role of team lead, someone who led the team and

612
00:32:09,368 --> 00:32:10,428
managed everyone on it.

613
00:32:10,748 --> 00:32:15,330
This will be relevant in a bit because learnings were eventually your teams are going to grow

614
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,031
way too big and you need to fragment them and narrow their scope.

615
00:32:19,132 --> 00:32:23,997
So, for example, our growth team fragmented into teams like social, gamification, and retention

616
00:32:24,197 --> 00:32:29,342
as all elements of growth that had narrower scope. But honestly, our limiting factor when it came to

617
00:32:29,362 --> 00:32:33,907
making more teams was ready leadership when it came to making new teams. And this is why I

618
00:32:33,947 --> 00:32:35,388
introduced the team lead concept earlier.

619
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:40,130
I think one of our biggest learnings was we tended to sit at a very high bar for

620
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:40,991
what it meant to be a leader.

621
00:32:41,011 --> 00:32:44,732
And generally, we'd rather have a more senior person double up and

622
00:32:44,752 --> 00:32:48,033
kind of be stretched than in lead two teams than have someone more junior as

623
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:48,673
a team lead.

624
00:32:49,274 --> 00:32:51,134
Not saying this is necessarily right, but this is what we did.

625
00:32:51,254 --> 00:32:52,014
And here are the reasons.

626
00:32:52,715 --> 00:32:55,617
One of them is you really risk stunting technical growth.

627
00:32:55,657 --> 00:32:57,638
And when I say technical, it doesn't have to be engineering.

628
00:32:57,778 --> 00:33:00,980
It's sort of like all the things you learn from building something,

629
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:05,143
from doing your day to day job, you stunt early if you put someone

630
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:07,625
in a leadership position that occupies all of their time.

631
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:11,207
So being really sensitive to what growth are you potentially stunting

632
00:33:11,247 --> 00:33:14,109
when it comes to putting someone in that position early is really important.

633
00:33:14,849 --> 00:33:19,953
And it's also really hard to unmake someone, a manager or a team lead.

634
00:33:20,034 --> 00:33:22,395
Once someone is in that position, it feels like demotion, even though it's really

635
00:33:22,436 --> 00:33:25,118
not, to put them back on the individual contributor track.

636
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:27,440
So be very careful about this as well.

637
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:33,731
Okay, after we had 33 teams, I'm saying like we kind of do things as late as possible.

638
00:33:33,751 --> 00:33:36,352
We had 33 teams on like this really flat structure.

639
00:33:36,412 --> 00:33:38,533
We decided we probably need some other layer.

640
00:33:38,793 --> 00:33:41,495
So now we have areas composed of several teams.

641
00:33:42,015 --> 00:33:45,617
We now have area leads and this structure was really useful for sparse resources.

642
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:48,758
So for example, we're very low on designers at Duolingo and

643
00:33:48,878 --> 00:33:51,820
we had a situation where a designer was embedded on like four different teams and

644
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,740
just like stressed.

645
00:33:53,581 --> 00:33:54,601
So what ARIA has allowed us to do

646
00:33:54,621 --> 00:33:56,883
were to group teams under this umbrella called ARIA,

647
00:33:56,983 --> 00:33:58,884
have ARIA level design, and be able to take

648
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:00,665
care of the designers in terms of their priorities

649
00:34:00,725 --> 00:34:03,427
and just saying you're in charge of ARIA, not these four teams.

650
00:34:04,988 --> 00:34:07,169
And ARIA leadership was responsible for status,

651
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:08,990
for summarization, goal setting, et cetera.

652
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,971
Here are the areas that we have today.

653
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:13,012
And we also had something called business units,

654
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:15,414
which were new verticals or little mini-companies

655
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:16,635
within the company.

656
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:18,856
So it's possible to have little mini-companies in your company

657
00:34:18,876 --> 00:34:21,598
that are working on independent verticals as well.

658
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:25,811
And then finally, not all teams are in areas at Dolingo.

659
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:28,254
So anything that is a little more functional, marketing people, finance,

660
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:31,898
strategy business, or function-based teams that support the rest of the company,

661
00:34:32,158 --> 00:34:32,819
just remain teams.

662
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,181
And that's totally okay, not everything needs to fit in this structure.

663
00:34:36,637 --> 00:34:40,358
Okay, so a few lessons learned is just like in coding,

664
00:34:40,658 --> 00:34:43,139
naming is strangely extremely important

665
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:43,939
when it comes to teams.

666
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:44,760
Like this is one of the things

667
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,200
that you would not think is important at all,

668
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,021
but somehow was really important for us.

669
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,362
Naming a team defines the assumptions

670
00:34:52,422 --> 00:34:55,183
about what area of ownership that team has,

671
00:34:55,703 --> 00:34:57,644
and people will therefore reach out to teams

672
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,784
that they feel like are closest

673
00:34:58,824 --> 00:35:00,205
to the information they need.

674
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,965
And if that is very obfuscated,

675
00:35:02,046 --> 00:35:04,626
people will not know who to go to for things.

676
00:35:05,547 --> 00:35:12,210
It's also the case that employees will tend to remember team names but not mission statements or the goals of each team if you have a lot of teams.

677
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:18,412
So all they have to go off of for knowing what the company finds important is the teams that the company has.

678
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:21,774
So if you have a team called retention, it means the company cares about retention.

679
00:35:21,794 --> 00:35:22,614
So...

680
00:35:25,836 --> 00:35:28,037
All this to say somehow naming has become very important.

681
00:35:28,057 --> 00:35:31,859
And we've run into problems in the past where we name something poorly and

682
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:33,760
it just confuses everyone in the company.

683
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:35,622
So naming is important.

684
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:41,125
The other thing we realized is sometimes we would do organizational reorgs or

685
00:35:41,165 --> 00:35:44,507
have brilliant plans for how to have a very perfect organizational structure.

686
00:35:45,027 --> 00:35:46,688
And then always, always at the end,

687
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:50,110
we'll pare it down to the most minimum viable plan that changes the fewest

688
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,711
number of things.

689
00:35:51,131 --> 00:35:55,692
Mainly because manager team changes, team restaffings are often very disruptive.

690
00:35:56,613 --> 00:36:00,234
So we tend to do smaller organizational changes, little tweaks like one person moving, etc.

691
00:36:00,294 --> 00:36:01,194
every one to two quarters.

692
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:07,336
We do large reorgs about once a year and we add a layer every three years or so.

693
00:36:08,816 --> 00:36:11,497
So this is sort of like the cadence of how we move things.

694
00:36:13,275 --> 00:36:14,596
All this to say, be very practical.

695
00:36:14,996 --> 00:36:17,798
So we will never, ever have a perfect organizational structure.

696
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:20,420
This is literally what I personally work on almost all the time.

697
00:36:21,061 --> 00:36:24,903
But strive for slowly improving your organizational structure over time to

698
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:28,626
keep the minimum acceptable level of chaos, I think is what I'd like to say here.

699
00:36:29,526 --> 00:36:32,789
There will always be overlap, gray areas, things will fall through the cracks,

700
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:34,050
you won't be able to staff something.

701
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,531
Or there won't be quite the right leadership in time, and

702
00:36:36,551 --> 00:36:40,034
that is totally normal and expected.

703
00:36:41,454 --> 00:36:42,414
So there's no right answer.

704
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:44,555
There are kind of two paths you can take and you can decide for

705
00:36:44,575 --> 00:36:47,016
a company where on the spectrum you want them to lie.

706
00:36:47,396 --> 00:36:51,937
You can either have a really stable, rigid teams that is great for

707
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:56,478
building team expertise, loyalty, stability, a sense of ownership, etc.

708
00:36:57,378 --> 00:36:59,799
Having sort of the same people on the same team for a long period of time.

709
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,661
You can also have really scrappy, flexible,

710
00:37:02,801 --> 00:37:04,743
you're expected to change teams all the time.

711
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:06,845
Highly agile teams, that's great for

712
00:37:06,945 --> 00:37:09,588
innovation and always working on high ROI things.

713
00:37:09,628 --> 00:37:11,569
If you want to always put your superstars on

714
00:37:11,589 --> 00:37:13,852
the most important thing, this structure is great too.

715
00:37:14,652 --> 00:37:15,753
There are pros and cons of each of these,

716
00:37:15,914 --> 00:37:17,995
and maybe you actually have a few people

717
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:19,437
on each of these spectrum as well.

718
00:37:20,258 --> 00:37:22,380
There's no right answer, but here are the options available.

719
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:27,748
All right, and then finally, yeah, different things work for different companies.

720
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:28,969
Finally, processes.

721
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:32,413
So originally there were like eight processes here and I'm only going to share two with

722
00:37:32,653 --> 00:37:35,636
you today because one, there's not enough time to it's probably really boring to most

723
00:37:35,656 --> 00:37:36,016
people here.

724
00:37:37,097 --> 00:37:40,060
But one process that really drives Duolingo is OKRs.

725
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,783
No one really likes hearing about OKRs, but here's why I'm talking about them.

726
00:37:43,603 --> 00:37:46,526
It's really good for setting goals and alignment.

727
00:37:48,048 --> 00:37:51,109
If you don't know what OKRs are, they're a set of objectives and

728
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:55,891
the key results you want to accomplish towards that rejective.

729
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:58,072
Ideally, they are measurable and

730
00:37:58,092 --> 00:38:00,112
you will receive a grade at the end of the quarter.

731
00:38:01,273 --> 00:38:04,974
The key thing here that we really had to untrain our perfectionists on is the goal

732
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:08,615
is to get a weighted score, and when I say weighted, it's weighted based on priority,

733
00:38:09,355 --> 00:38:11,096
of 0.7 at the end of the quarter.

734
00:38:11,196 --> 00:38:13,057
If you get higher than a 0.7, it's actually not great.

735
00:38:13,077 --> 00:38:14,557
It means you weren't ambitious enough with your goals.

736
00:38:16,198 --> 00:38:18,319
So it's, and the other thing I just really want to emphasize,

737
00:38:18,359 --> 00:38:22,322
especially to leaders here, is this measure in this grade is a measure of how well

738
00:38:22,382 --> 00:38:25,504
you planned, not a measure of how good a team is.

739
00:38:26,905 --> 00:38:29,987
If you find that a team gets a 0.3 at the end of the quarter,

740
00:38:30,027 --> 00:38:33,309
the correct discussion to have after that is,

741
00:38:33,429 --> 00:38:35,410
how did we fail this team in terms of planning?

742
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,472
What were the unanticipated things that happened?

743
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:39,633
Why were our estimations off?

744
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:41,955
It is not about the performance of the team.

745
00:38:42,175 --> 00:38:44,856
It's about how we can plan and scope things better to prevent crunch.

746
00:38:46,218 --> 00:38:48,338
So problems addressed here, align on goals,

747
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:52,259
communicate priorities, have accountability on these teams,

748
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,620
and practice much better planning and prediction

749
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,660
when it comes to the goals

750
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,841
and how realistic they are setting for your teams.

751
00:38:59,961 --> 00:39:02,082
So here's a concrete example from,

752
00:39:02,142 --> 00:39:03,722
I just pulled this from like retention,

753
00:39:04,002 --> 00:39:05,042
obfuscated some numbers.

754
00:39:05,382 --> 00:39:06,603
You don't have to understand what this is,

755
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:07,963
but this is kind of what an example

756
00:39:07,983 --> 00:39:09,263
of an OKR looks like here, right?

757
00:39:09,383 --> 00:39:12,164
Is the objective is just to improve the retention

758
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:14,445
of one of our features from X to Y.

759
00:39:15,425 --> 00:39:18,307
And then here are the P0s, the two most important things we want to do for that.

760
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:20,187
Here's the P1, here are two P2s.

761
00:39:21,288 --> 00:39:23,989
And one thing I just want to highlight here is note that these all kind of start

762
00:39:24,009 --> 00:39:27,031
with verbs and have things like reduce latency, run experiment,

763
00:39:27,351 --> 00:39:30,313
port to improvements, launch experiment, run experiment.

764
00:39:31,572 --> 00:39:36,639
And what I want to say here is one of the biggest tips I have is, again, naming and

765
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:39,803
consistent terminology is actually super, super important.

766
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:44,970
So we have these terms at Duolingo, especially around our A-B testing framework of

767
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:48,155
launch, run, roll out, port, prototype, get stakeholder approval.

768
00:39:48,855 --> 00:39:52,977
And the reason precise terminology is important is it helps control scope.

769
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:56,799
As a leader, you want to protect your team from scope creep.

770
00:39:57,139 --> 00:40:00,380
And that means not promising, let's just launch all these experiments,

771
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,921
but really diving into what are the right milestones I can deliver.

772
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,482
for these very arbitrary quarter boundaries, right?

773
00:40:07,803 --> 00:40:11,283
It's not always going to be the case that features should fit nicely within quarter boundaries.

774
00:40:11,303 --> 00:40:15,625
So how can you break that up so that the right milestones are expected out of your team?

775
00:40:15,645 --> 00:40:18,465
Whether it's just let's just get stakeholder approval and get on the same page about the

776
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:23,067
product we're building versus let's just implement the thing but we're not going to be able to roll

777
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:27,188
it out to learners yet. It won't be ready or QA'd by time. If you have precise terminology,

778
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:30,189
you prevent that scope creep and you protect your team from crunch.

779
00:40:32,258 --> 00:40:34,199
Other thing we've learned is collaborative KRs

780
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:36,540
across two teams that have their own separate OKRs

781
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,780
should be verbatim.

782
00:40:38,681 --> 00:40:40,782
On both teams, OKRs with the same priority

783
00:40:40,862 --> 00:40:44,043
because it's really bad if this is the most important thing

784
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:45,644
for this team to collaborate on

785
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,525
and the least important thing for this other team

786
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,006
to collaborate on and have different priorities

787
00:40:49,026 --> 00:40:51,087
because one of them is going to do it, the other is not.

788
00:40:51,507 --> 00:40:52,507
And then you screw over the team

789
00:40:52,547 --> 00:40:53,628
for which it's really important.

790
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:56,729
So OKRs are a way to sink on these things very explicitly

791
00:40:56,769 --> 00:40:59,411
that we agree this is a priority for both of our teams.

792
00:41:00,935 --> 00:41:05,438
And the sort of last point here, I think, is OKRs are very strong incentives for teams.

793
00:41:05,998 --> 00:41:10,801
So capture work you want to make sure gets done, especially traditionally thankless work.

794
00:41:10,861 --> 00:41:12,102
I am a huge proponent of this.

795
00:41:12,522 --> 00:41:18,206
Documentation, fixing bugs, stability, cleaning up technical debt all really need to be represented

796
00:41:18,386 --> 00:41:21,748
and celebrated and given credit for when it comes to planning.

797
00:41:21,768 --> 00:41:24,470
They can't all just be top line business metrics.

798
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:28,192
Because if you want these things to happen, it's very important for these things to happen,

799
00:41:28,312 --> 00:41:29,693
you need to reward and recognize that.

800
00:41:31,637 --> 00:41:34,258
OK, something a little more fun outside of the manager world

801
00:41:34,518 --> 00:41:36,258
is one of the things that we have learned

802
00:41:36,418 --> 00:41:38,639
is to really, really invest in greasing

803
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:40,439
the wheels of the things that your company spends

804
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:41,359
a lot of time doing.

805
00:41:41,879 --> 00:41:44,180
And since we run 300 experiments a month,

806
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,360
we wanted to invest in what we call automated experiment

807
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:47,760
reports.

808
00:41:48,281 --> 00:41:51,281
So every single test we run has a report automatically

809
00:41:51,321 --> 00:41:54,242
generated nightly, including all the KPIs across the company

810
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:56,382
that people have submitted their own teams care about.

811
00:41:57,442 --> 00:42:00,183
and whether that experiment had a significant impact on any of them.

812
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,564
So here's a sort of example experiment report.

813
00:42:02,624 --> 00:42:03,524
I'm not sure if you can read it.

814
00:42:04,084 --> 00:42:06,025
You know, here I can look at my experiment,

815
00:42:06,325 --> 00:42:08,166
learning multiplier and decay web, whatnot,

816
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,526
and see like, ah, it seems statistically significant

817
00:42:10,566 --> 00:42:13,647
for increasing active users over time.

818
00:42:14,027 --> 00:42:14,307
Great.

819
00:42:14,748 --> 00:42:15,788
And if I scroll down this,

820
00:42:15,828 --> 00:42:17,969
they would be revenue metrics, retention metrics,

821
00:42:18,009 --> 00:42:20,149
and every metric every team in the company cares about

822
00:42:20,169 --> 00:42:23,190
to make sure I'm not screwing up someone else's metric over time.

823
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:27,092
And this being automated meant it was super transparent

824
00:42:27,372 --> 00:42:30,593
and prevented me from sort of messing with another team's

825
00:42:30,633 --> 00:42:31,053
metrics.

826
00:42:32,374 --> 00:42:34,555
So the problems we addressed here, very, very fast feedback.

827
00:42:34,575 --> 00:42:36,176
These reports were generated nightly,

828
00:42:37,396 --> 00:42:39,157
included all the guardrail metrics so that you didn't

829
00:42:39,177 --> 00:42:40,778
have to memorize them or know who to go to

830
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:42,659
or know what to look at to do it.

831
00:42:43,779 --> 00:42:45,620
It makes experiment analysis super accessible,

832
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,900
especially to non-technical people

833
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,281
or non-statisticians like me.

834
00:42:49,161 --> 00:42:51,743
And it vastly, vastly accelerated decision making

835
00:42:51,923 --> 00:42:53,643
on whether or not to launch or shut down experiments.

836
00:42:54,974 --> 00:42:55,174
Great.

837
00:42:56,195 --> 00:42:57,715
Last section, we're almost through, I told you.

838
00:42:57,815 --> 00:42:58,416
This will be rapid.

839
00:42:58,436 --> 00:42:59,456
So relatable growing pains

840
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,117
that you will probably inevitably encounter.

841
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,498
First, we're gonna start with engineering pains.

842
00:43:04,038 --> 00:43:07,439
Ownership voids and untenable backlogs, hopefully relatable.

843
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,121
The way that we are trying to address this now

844
00:43:10,181 --> 00:43:12,101
is to form centralized bug triage groups

845
00:43:12,562 --> 00:43:14,482
with very senior leaders so that we could communicate

846
00:43:14,522 --> 00:43:16,503
this is actually important and worthwhile time.

847
00:43:16,923 --> 00:43:19,224
We're also now forming decentralized groups per area.

848
00:43:20,485 --> 00:43:23,488
And also adding a ton of automation for duplicate reports.

849
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:25,729
So one of the things that we started drowning in

850
00:43:25,789 --> 00:43:28,031
is people reporting the same problems over and over again

851
00:43:28,051 --> 00:43:30,793
and it literally took all of our time to even dedupe those

852
00:43:30,854 --> 00:43:32,175
than to even start addressing them.

853
00:43:32,575 --> 00:43:34,857
So invest in technology that helps you be able

854
00:43:34,897 --> 00:43:37,359
to do these sort of lower ROI tasks.

855
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,741
And also, as I mentioned, OKRs,

856
00:43:39,821 --> 00:43:42,363
including bug squishing and triage in those OKRs

857
00:43:42,423 --> 00:43:44,144
means people will get protected time to do them

858
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:45,585
and you account for them in your planning.

859
00:43:46,366 --> 00:43:47,026
We're still bad at this.

860
00:43:48,177 --> 00:43:50,522
Other thing, legacy code and technical debt.

861
00:43:51,384 --> 00:43:55,534
Occasionally we will actually just stop and do all hands on deck projects to clean up

862
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:57,137
code base rewrites or redesigns.

863
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,431
Hopefully you don't get to that point,

864
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:00,892
you will probably get to that point,

865
00:44:00,952 --> 00:44:02,433
and it's important to kind of put the foot down

866
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:03,734
and say we just really need to do this

867
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:06,216
to accelerate how quickly we can code in the future.

868
00:44:07,457 --> 00:44:09,239
And some quarters we actually ask all teams

869
00:44:09,299 --> 00:44:11,881
to include a care dedicated to reducing technical debt.

870
00:44:12,902 --> 00:44:14,182
Technical debt will always be one of those

871
00:44:14,243 --> 00:44:15,884
high importance, low urgency things.

872
00:44:16,444 --> 00:44:18,286
So I think that the key thing to learn here

873
00:44:18,546 --> 00:44:20,127
is to really invest in those things.

874
00:44:20,147 --> 00:44:21,748
We also have an annual company grease week

875
00:44:22,149 --> 00:44:23,870
where everyone in the company takes a week

876
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:25,331
to just clean up shop.

877
00:44:26,152 --> 00:44:29,897
do those refactors you've always wanted to do, write that documentation you've always wanted to have,

878
00:44:30,378 --> 00:44:34,704
etc. No one's going to bother you that week. You won't have any meetings that week. And it's

879
00:44:34,764 --> 00:44:38,250
really important that everyone does this at the exact same time, because if it's only a few people,

880
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:41,134
you're just going to get drowned in the work that other teams are asking of you anyway.

881
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:43,384
communication pains.

882
00:44:44,244 --> 00:44:46,346
So a lot of stakeholder, this is like the one emoji

883
00:44:46,366 --> 00:44:49,069
I managed to like insert in this presentation

884
00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:50,170
and I decided on this one.

885
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:52,012
I'm that stakeholder, I'm that problem,

886
00:44:52,112 --> 00:44:53,053
so I can talk about it.

887
00:44:53,553 --> 00:44:54,674
So one of the things we did was,

888
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,996
you know, it was the case that teams really needed

889
00:44:57,016 --> 00:44:58,318
to know what other teams were doing,

890
00:44:58,378 --> 00:45:00,460
if they affected their metric or their feature.

891
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,001
So we have this template now.

892
00:45:02,622 --> 00:45:05,103
where there's just a list of all required collaborators

893
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:07,264
or people you need to contact in order

894
00:45:07,364 --> 00:45:09,945
to get your feature approved if it touches

895
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,245
any one of these domains.

896
00:45:11,285 --> 00:45:12,506
And that's been really, really helpful.

897
00:45:13,286 --> 00:45:16,007
And we're also just investigating different stages

898
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:16,768
of feature development.

899
00:45:16,788 --> 00:45:17,948
When something's just an ideation,

900
00:45:17,988 --> 00:45:19,329
you don't want to put red tape on it.

901
00:45:19,689 --> 00:45:21,610
So we're sort of trying to set expectations now

902
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:23,030
for how far along a project you need

903
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,331
to be in order to start pulling in stakeholders

904
00:45:25,371 --> 00:45:27,032
to really minimize stakeholder management

905
00:45:27,052 --> 00:45:29,513
at the beginning of projects and only introducing stakeholders

906
00:45:29,753 --> 00:45:30,433
actually needed.

907
00:45:31,876 --> 00:45:34,999
Other communication pain is onboarding and documentation.

908
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:37,721
We have an internal content management system now,

909
00:45:38,281 --> 00:45:39,602
was highly worth investing in,

910
00:45:39,662 --> 00:45:41,583
where we just do automated training

911
00:45:42,204 --> 00:45:43,765
for all of our new employees.

912
00:45:44,886 --> 00:45:47,368
And we have a group that audits the quality regularly

913
00:45:47,488 --> 00:45:49,910
of this, very, very worthwhile investment for us.

914
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:53,092
We standardize our career ladders to share a common core

915
00:45:53,132 --> 00:45:56,154
so that all of our levels would be fairly consistent.

916
00:45:56,174 --> 00:45:58,556
And then we also hire people to lead this initiative,

917
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:00,017
starting with the leadership training.

918
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:02,950
And then the final pain I'm trying to talk about

919
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,610
are emotional pains, which are usually

920
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:05,431
the hardest to deal with.

921
00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:08,211
Handling low performers and exits

922
00:46:08,271 --> 00:46:10,212
was honestly very, very hard for us and still is.

923
00:46:11,232 --> 00:46:12,892
Dolingo needed to get a lot better at acting

924
00:46:13,032 --> 00:46:13,773
on low performance.

925
00:46:13,793 --> 00:46:14,793
We were often too kind.

926
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,313
So we created a playbook for managers

927
00:46:17,393 --> 00:46:19,274
on identifying and handling low performance.

928
00:46:19,334 --> 00:46:21,154
And we found that often managers actually just

929
00:46:21,354 --> 00:46:23,735
lacked the confidence to even note or judge someone

930
00:46:23,775 --> 00:46:24,555
as a low performer.

931
00:46:25,295 --> 00:46:27,296
So we gave much more objective guidelines for that

932
00:46:27,336 --> 00:46:29,476
so also everyone could understand what it means

933
00:46:29,696 --> 00:46:30,857
to not be doing well.

934
00:46:32,177 --> 00:46:34,679
And the other emotional pain was really pivots and sunsetting projects,

935
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:36,801
which I think a lot of people encounter early on.

936
00:46:37,601 --> 00:46:41,184
What we found is early communication, transparency around the reasoning behind

937
00:46:41,224 --> 00:46:44,186
it is like if you believe in that reason, you shouldn't be ashamed to share it.

938
00:46:45,047 --> 00:46:49,611
And oftentimes we actually found that it was the team building the feature

939
00:46:49,751 --> 00:46:51,852
that ultimately decided it should be sunsetted and

940
00:46:51,872 --> 00:46:53,854
that is such a healthier way to go about it as well.

941
00:46:54,434 --> 00:46:57,996
So retrospectives are great and healthy and we really need to encourage

942
00:46:58,056 --> 00:47:03,259
blamelessness in those. And I think the most important thing is to reward

943
00:47:03,299 --> 00:47:06,781
innovation even if it results in failure. If you want an innovative company, if you

944
00:47:06,801 --> 00:47:10,103
want your best people working on innovation, they need to not have the

945
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:12,944
fear that their careers would be ruined if it doesn't work out, right? That's not

946
00:47:12,984 --> 00:47:13,965
how innovation works.

947
00:47:14,405 --> 00:47:18,249
So we need to figure out ways to celebrate our, not even failures, but

948
00:47:18,289 --> 00:47:21,312
to celebrate projects that didn't pan out and the things that we learned from it.

949
00:47:21,873 --> 00:47:26,117
And so many of our failures at Duolingo ended up turning into foundations for

950
00:47:26,157 --> 00:47:27,078
future successes.

951
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,924
Great, so most people need to know, yeah, right.

952
00:47:33,064 --> 00:47:36,127
Most people need to know that having a project not succeed or

953
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:37,869
having a project sunset won't set back their career.

954
00:47:38,947 --> 00:47:40,647
All right, we are towards the end of this,

955
00:47:40,687 --> 00:47:42,828
so I'm just going to rapid fire through the recap

956
00:47:42,948 --> 00:47:45,209
and takeaways here because we talked through a lot of things.

957
00:47:45,249 --> 00:47:46,550
So first, we started with people.

958
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,690
Hiring the right people, single most important thing.

959
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:49,611
You could do it early on.

960
00:47:50,611 --> 00:47:52,472
Generalists, highly recommend.

961
00:47:52,512 --> 00:47:55,753
You want people who are willing to wear many hats as well.

962
00:47:56,833 --> 00:47:57,774
Keep that bar high.

963
00:47:58,514 --> 00:47:59,475
And retain good talent.

964
00:48:00,396 --> 00:48:02,699
Retaining good talent, just as good, if not better,

965
00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:04,020
than being able to hire new talent.

966
00:48:05,201 --> 00:48:06,843
And ensure that employees understand

967
00:48:06,863 --> 00:48:09,165
the value of their time and prioritize that time

968
00:48:09,326 --> 00:48:10,827
accordingly as well.

969
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:14,351
One thing that we know is your leadership layer will likely

970
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,292
be your limiting factor.

971
00:48:15,312 --> 00:48:16,874
So invest in growing good leaders

972
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,395
and identifying potential there.

973
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:25,050
And also relatedly, resist the temptation to force someone to be a leader before they are ready.

974
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:26,110
You will stunt their growth.

975
00:48:26,691 --> 00:48:29,511
And then finally, it is better to have a hole than an a-hole.

976
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:33,353
Like I said, I will send out these slides afterwards.

977
00:48:33,633 --> 00:48:36,354
Great. In terms of strategy, be aware of the trends.

978
00:48:36,454 --> 00:48:39,655
You know, we rode that mobile wave and it was excellent for us.

979
00:48:40,935 --> 00:48:42,556
Identify and preserve your moats.

980
00:48:42,616 --> 00:48:45,777
What are the competitive advantages that you uniquely want to invest in?

981
00:48:45,957 --> 00:48:48,238
Ours was a huge user base in A-B testing.

982
00:48:48,818 --> 00:48:49,758
It could be very different for you.

983
00:48:50,964 --> 00:48:55,508
Align, as much as possible, your business objectives, your mission, and

984
00:48:55,528 --> 00:48:56,188
your incentives.

985
00:48:56,248 --> 00:48:58,130
If they are aligned, you will have smooth sailing.

986
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,572
If they are misaligned, there will be a lot of unhappiness.

987
00:49:01,052 --> 00:49:02,413
So do your best to align these things.

988
00:49:03,994 --> 00:49:05,675
And try to have a rational and

989
00:49:05,695 --> 00:49:09,738
emotionally detached lens when reading user feedback as well.

990
00:49:10,059 --> 00:49:12,360
Try to listen to the data, listen to all of your users,

991
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,641
not just the most vocal ones.

992
00:49:14,762 --> 00:49:18,265
And make room for innovation and failure, especially.

993
00:49:19,764 --> 00:49:20,545
Prioritization here.

994
00:49:21,365 --> 00:49:24,567
Focus, don't try to do everything at once or be good at everything at once.

995
00:49:24,707 --> 00:49:27,529
And really, really focus on things that are most important to you at the time.

996
00:49:27,569 --> 00:49:30,090
You will not have the resources to do everything at once.

997
00:49:31,191 --> 00:49:32,832
Get really good at saying not yet.

998
00:49:34,893 --> 00:49:38,155
Optimize for fast, well-informed decision making.

999
00:49:39,075 --> 00:49:41,977
Decision making tends to be the thing that drags things on, so

1000
00:49:42,417 --> 00:49:44,658
invest in making it speedy and objective.

1001
00:49:46,814 --> 00:49:51,298
Use third party tools when they are available, do not invest in in-house things until you

1002
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,780
outgrow them and truly outgrow them.

1003
00:49:53,681 --> 00:49:57,685
And then finally here on the prioritization front, as a reminder from our CEO, you can

1004
00:49:57,765 --> 00:49:59,827
like the whales without committing to saving the whales.

1005
00:49:59,927 --> 00:50:04,771
So when it comes to wanting to do good, wanting to do philanthropic efforts, really focus

1006
00:50:04,792 --> 00:50:09,516
on the things you're uniquely positioned to benefit and that will give you the highest

1007
00:50:09,536 --> 00:50:10,337
leverage and impact.

1008
00:50:11,348 --> 00:50:13,048
Organizational structure, be patient.

1009
00:50:13,228 --> 00:50:14,669
Don't jump the gun on these things.

1010
00:50:15,089 --> 00:50:17,630
Inserting organizational layers, scaling out a feature

1011
00:50:17,690 --> 00:50:19,530
before you find product market fit for it,

1012
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,611
putting someone in a leadership position

1013
00:50:21,631 --> 00:50:24,231
they aren't ready for, hiring functions or positions

1014
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:25,011
before you need them.

1015
00:50:25,232 --> 00:50:27,212
As we demonstrated, we actually waited a really long time

1016
00:50:27,252 --> 00:50:28,372
to hire certain functions.

1017
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:31,053
And also name teams well.

1018
00:50:31,973 --> 00:50:33,394
Try to optimize enabling the team

1019
00:50:33,414 --> 00:50:36,214
to get things done autonomously and to feel

1020
00:50:36,254 --> 00:50:39,155
a sense of control over what their success can be.

1021
00:50:41,071 --> 00:50:44,694
Find the right balance between flexible, agile, scrappy,

1022
00:50:44,734 --> 00:50:47,596
versus stability and building knowledge leaders and ownership.

1023
00:50:49,198 --> 00:50:53,141
And finally, recognize that organizational structure is always going to be a work in progress.

1024
00:50:53,381 --> 00:50:56,684
And you might get grumpy about the cracks and holes, but it's okay.

1025
00:50:56,944 --> 00:50:57,765
They will always be there.

1026
00:50:58,265 --> 00:51:02,168
And building up a sort of tolerance for vagueness, I think, is one of the best things you could do.

1027
00:51:03,365 --> 00:51:05,085
And finally, I used to have a lot of bullets here,

1028
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:07,426
but the only thing I have to say about process as a takeaway

1029
00:51:07,506 --> 00:51:09,586
is only implement and create them when you need it

1030
00:51:09,706 --> 00:51:10,347
and not earlier.

1031
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:13,428
And if you want to actually look into the processes

1032
00:51:13,468 --> 00:51:15,288
that I described today and all the hidden slides,

1033
00:51:15,768 --> 00:51:17,569
I'm more than happy to share that after this talk.

1034
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:19,549
All right, we did it.

1035
00:51:19,569 --> 00:51:23,330
I think we have seven minutes for Q&A.

1036
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,611
Thank you for riding along with me.

1037
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:31,512
Thank you.

1038
00:51:31,532 --> 00:51:32,533
Seven minutes for questions.

1039
00:51:37,055 --> 00:51:39,116
I have a tooth in my hair.

1040
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:39,497
Hi.

1041
00:51:39,757 --> 00:51:41,438
The talk is amazing, absolutely amazing.

1042
00:51:42,019 --> 00:51:44,020
Can you shed some light on the A-B testing

1043
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,521
on unmeasurable things?

1044
00:51:45,941 --> 00:51:49,644
I mean, yeah, because neutral results is not enough, right?

1045
00:51:49,904 --> 00:51:51,406
We will know it's A or B.

1046
00:51:51,426 --> 00:51:53,387
Sorry, can you repeat the last question?

1047
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:57,751
I just want to know more about A-B testing and measurable things.

1048
00:51:57,931 --> 00:51:59,052
Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1049
00:51:59,572 --> 00:52:04,113
So there's a, I'm happy to share my 2020 talk that actually dives into this.

1050
00:52:04,153 --> 00:52:05,214
It has a whole section on this.

1051
00:52:05,894 --> 00:52:10,696
The main thing is, so the main thing we couldn't measure well was how well our learners were

1052
00:52:10,716 --> 00:52:13,176
actually learning a language because learning takes a very long time.

1053
00:52:13,657 --> 00:52:17,038
In most A-B tests we run, we want to run within two weeks, but two weeks is not enough time

1054
00:52:17,078 --> 00:52:18,138
to learn something, right?

1055
00:52:19,399 --> 00:52:24,524
So we spent a lot of time actually trying to invest in how can we quickly measure learning.

1056
00:52:24,604 --> 00:52:27,147
And we honestly I think wasted like a year trying to do this.

1057
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:31,652
And instead we flipped the approach to saying, okay, we have all of these what we call guardrail metrics.

1058
00:52:31,672 --> 00:52:33,554
So things like retention that we never want to hurt.

1059
00:52:33,574 --> 00:52:35,456
There are things like revenue we don't want to hurt.

1060
00:52:36,036 --> 00:52:45,779
And so long as we don't hurt metrics, let us implement changes that are described by a pedagogical expert and our learning scientists as good changes for learning.

1061
00:52:45,859 --> 00:52:51,801
And let's call it a win even if all the if all the metrics are neutral, but an expert says this is better for learning.

1062
00:52:52,121 --> 00:52:57,022
That is going to be our new win. It's not going to be an increase in user active. It's not going to be an increase in retention.

1063
00:52:57,402 --> 00:53:03,124
It's going to be we removed more translation from our app and are doing more monolingual exercises or we were able to.

1064
00:53:03,624 --> 00:53:06,306
serve learners harder content without them getting frustrated.

1065
00:53:06,706 --> 00:53:08,868
Those were the things that we celebrated as wins,

1066
00:53:08,948 --> 00:53:10,349
even if they didn't move our numbers,

1067
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,550
because we just knew it was better pedagogically

1068
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:13,711
from the experts that told us.

1069
00:53:13,751 --> 00:53:14,952
So, does that make sense?

1070
00:53:15,432 --> 00:53:16,073
Yeah, thanks.

1071
00:53:16,213 --> 00:53:16,893
That helps a lot.

1072
00:53:16,933 --> 00:53:17,073
Yeah.

1073
00:53:18,835 --> 00:53:19,075
Hi.

1074
00:53:19,495 --> 00:53:19,635
Hi.

1075
00:53:20,939 --> 00:53:24,602
I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit more about how you guys think about monetization,

1076
00:53:25,262 --> 00:53:29,145
because, I mean, clearly you guys have to invest a lot in marketing and that's very expensive,

1077
00:53:29,346 --> 00:53:34,850
and you know, you guys have certain runways, but at the same time you do want to move on to

1078
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:40,515
efficacy, right? So at what point do you say, okay, we're making, quote-unquote, enough money to

1079
00:53:40,955 --> 00:53:46,380
maybe make that our secondary focus, right, and start working on other things versus, you know what,

1080
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:49,901
don't worry about anything else, focus on monetization.

1081
00:53:50,422 --> 00:53:51,962
How do you find the right balance there?

1082
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,463
Yeah, that's a great question.

1083
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:55,604
Honestly, one, I'm not an expert in at all,

1084
00:53:55,624 --> 00:53:57,465
so I can only kind of give my personal take on it.

1085
00:53:59,606 --> 00:54:02,767
I think it really is about what is the most important thing to your company,

1086
00:54:02,827 --> 00:54:07,129
and it is absolutely not a bad thing at all for companies who want to make money, right?

1087
00:54:07,649 --> 00:54:12,751
For us, it really was that based on the people we've acquired over time

1088
00:54:12,771 --> 00:54:13,872
and how mission-centric they were,

1089
00:54:14,532 --> 00:54:19,557
our priority was being the best and biggest language learning company in the world.

1090
00:54:19,937 --> 00:54:24,101
And we knew we needed a ton of money to do it. So everything, when I talk about aligning sort

1091
00:54:24,121 --> 00:54:28,545
of your mission, your business objectives and your incentives, the sort of I'm talking about is we

1092
00:54:28,585 --> 00:54:33,109
wanted to make money and decided to continue prioritizing making money because we knew this

1093
00:54:33,149 --> 00:54:37,793
was the amount of money we would need to be able to penetrate like the English learning markets and

1094
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,795
to be able to provide education to the world, etc.

1095
00:54:40,335 --> 00:54:41,857
This is how much money we would need to do this.

1096
00:54:41,898 --> 00:54:44,601
So we decided to invest in learning as well,

1097
00:54:44,641 --> 00:54:47,886
because we said, one, we actually

1098
00:54:47,906 --> 00:54:49,608
want to teach languages to our learners.

1099
00:54:49,648 --> 00:54:50,569
That's why we all work here.

1100
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:53,453
But two, we would actually hit a market cap

1101
00:54:53,674 --> 00:54:55,937
when it came to monetization and growth.

1102
00:54:56,477 --> 00:55:00,379
if we only ever serve beginner courses or this number of courses.

1103
00:55:00,459 --> 00:55:03,300
Right. We wanted to teach advanced English so people could get jobs

1104
00:55:04,421 --> 00:55:07,942
in knowledge jobs in English, even if it weren't their first language.

1105
00:55:08,402 --> 00:55:10,663
So in some ways, everything kind of worked together

1106
00:55:10,723 --> 00:55:12,264
and that we decided to invest in learning.

1107
00:55:12,584 --> 00:55:15,785
Once you realize when it would uncap growth and monetization.

1108
00:55:16,345 --> 00:55:18,686
In some ways, it was it was related to monetization.

1109
00:55:18,726 --> 00:55:20,387
It wasn't really an if or or

1110
00:55:21,848 --> 00:55:24,829
it was more everything needs to work simultaneously towards our one goal.

1111
00:55:25,249 --> 00:55:27,292
And monetization and learning were both a part of that.

1112
00:55:27,652 --> 00:55:29,435
So when it comes to making enough money,

1113
00:55:29,495 --> 00:55:31,197
I think the question asked is, how much do you

1114
00:55:31,257 --> 00:55:32,659
need to accomplish your goals?

1115
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,063
And then also, is there anything that you actually

1116
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:36,444
need to prioritize a little bit more

1117
00:55:36,524 --> 00:55:39,368
to uncap your market potential in the future as well?

1118
00:55:40,209 --> 00:55:40,470
Thank you.

1119
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:40,991
Yeah.

1120
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:42,513
I don't know who was first.

1121
00:55:44,594 --> 00:55:45,134
Okay, go for it.

1122
00:55:45,614 --> 00:55:48,095
So I was wondering, you know, back in 2012

1123
00:55:48,935 --> 00:55:51,776
when you started, what was the ways that you guys

1124
00:55:51,816 --> 00:55:53,236
went about acquiring new users,

1125
00:55:54,316 --> 00:55:56,277
you know, aside from just building a nice app?

1126
00:55:56,777 --> 00:56:00,038
Yeah, sorry, what was the, what before new users?

1127
00:56:01,138 --> 00:56:01,458
Back in 2012.

1128
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:04,879
Yeah, sorry, I think I missed, like, the verb.

1129
00:56:05,527 --> 00:56:07,868
Oh, what was your mechanisms for acquiring new users?

1130
00:56:07,888 --> 00:56:09,209
Oh, the mechanisms, yes, yes.

1131
00:56:10,029 --> 00:56:12,370
So one really, this is another thing we got lucky on,

1132
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:14,752
is our CEO, Luis, gave a TED talk

1133
00:56:15,652 --> 00:56:18,554
about this idea of free education

1134
00:56:18,614 --> 00:56:20,755
that I think attracted a lot of people to our beta.

1135
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:27,699
So one of the I think that was one of the biggest drivers of people who signed up for the beta version of Duolingo was this TED Talk.

1136
00:56:27,739 --> 00:56:34,263
And I think there was a lot of evangelism in the more like Duolingo actually was born out of Carnegie Mellon University.

1137
00:56:34,323 --> 00:56:38,265
So I also think like we evangelized on campus and things like that too.

1138
00:56:38,885 --> 00:56:39,626
But truthfully.

1139
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:48,251
We didn't do that much and I think that's why we were lucky is we actually there was a lot of word of mouth that actually did it for us.

1140
00:56:48,711 --> 00:56:58,554
And that is not something we ever want to take for granted. But somehow when people tried the product it was new at the time. They were basically like oh my gosh I can actually learn a language like from my house for free.

1141
00:56:59,554 --> 00:57:05,296
And word of mouth was by far the highest driving factor even since recently of our growth.

1142
00:57:05,556 --> 00:57:07,256
at Dolingo, we actually didn't invest in marketing

1143
00:57:07,276 --> 00:57:10,457
for a very, very long time because of word of mouth.

1144
00:57:10,717 --> 00:57:12,178
And I think in terms of organic growth,

1145
00:57:12,818 --> 00:57:14,418
word of mouth only really comes when you are

1146
00:57:14,438 --> 00:57:17,419
a very, very solid brand, an authentic brand, right?

1147
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:19,400
So we actually almost intentionally didn't do

1148
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,180
too much like marketing or commercials

1149
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,361
because we wanted that organic word of mouth

1150
00:57:23,381 --> 00:57:25,001
to not become distilled.

1151
00:57:25,861 --> 00:57:27,702
So I would also say engaging with the community

1152
00:57:29,002 --> 00:57:31,423
and that Ted Talk, I think were our main drivers.

1153
00:57:32,423 --> 00:57:32,743
Thank you.

1154
00:57:33,343 --> 00:57:33,543
Thanks.

1155
00:57:34,283 --> 00:57:34,423
Brad?

1156
00:57:35,116 --> 00:57:36,357
I think we only have a minute left,

1157
00:57:36,397 --> 00:57:38,298
but I'm happy to go out to the wrap-up room

1158
00:57:38,378 --> 00:57:40,699
also for questions, but go ahead.

1159
00:57:40,759 --> 00:57:42,500
So here's a project management question.

1160
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,641
I liked your concept of the grease week,

1161
00:57:44,681 --> 00:57:46,682
and that's something that we've been experimenting with.

1162
00:57:46,702 --> 00:57:49,243
We have no meetings and focus on those things.

1163
00:57:50,544 --> 00:57:54,085
And with you having hundreds of new tests a week

1164
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:56,506
and talking about, or a month,

1165
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:59,108
talking about needing key stakeholders involved,

1166
00:57:59,708 --> 00:58:02,289
and with work from home, and we've experienced

1167
00:58:02,349 --> 00:58:04,430
an increase in meetings and fatigue with that.

1168
00:58:05,323 --> 00:58:10,810
Are there any key takeaways you guys have found with reducing meetings or having some

1169
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:14,575
sort of structure around that during work from home?

1170
00:58:14,615 --> 00:58:15,276
Yeah, 100%.

1171
00:58:15,416 --> 00:58:20,443
So as someone who literally's whole job is to have meetings, I feel the meeting fatigue

1172
00:58:20,483 --> 00:58:22,065
even though I'm hardened to it.

1173
00:58:22,926 --> 00:58:25,549
I think one of the main things is, I think for me at least,

1174
00:58:25,609 --> 00:58:27,130
there are meetings that drain energy

1175
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,492
and there are meetings that give energy.

1176
00:58:28,512 --> 00:58:31,815
And I think really thinking hard about inventorying,

1177
00:58:32,415 --> 00:58:34,938
what are the meetings that are draining energy from everyone?

1178
00:58:34,958 --> 00:58:37,040
They're probably not very useful meetings.

1179
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,002
And who are the meetings useful for?

1180
00:58:39,342 --> 00:58:43,386
as well? And is there a different means other than a meeting for those people to get that

1181
00:58:43,426 --> 00:58:49,052
benefit out? So we reduced the number of meetings we had and honestly, in some places, increased

1182
00:58:49,112 --> 00:58:53,136
the number of meetings we had based on this. Could this have just been a Slack message?

1183
00:58:53,436 --> 00:58:58,902
Could this have been some other process? Can there be fewer people in this meeting? I think

1184
00:58:59,042 --> 00:59:02,125
was really important for us, especially during COVID when there was so much meeting fatigue.

1185
00:59:02,946 --> 00:59:04,748
The other thing to do is things like grease weeks.

1186
00:59:04,808 --> 00:59:07,251
And also I think we give our managers a break at some point.

1187
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:09,033
I think when it comes to performance review season,

1188
00:59:09,393 --> 00:59:12,076
we say no meetings this week for managers.

1189
00:59:12,136 --> 00:59:14,659
I think literally having just one no meeting week

1190
00:59:14,919 --> 00:59:18,002
every now and then really, really helps people to reset.

1191
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:19,543
back to baseline.

1192
00:59:19,864 --> 00:59:24,086
But I would say the key culprit in this

1193
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:25,447
really is just useless meetings

1194
00:59:25,507 --> 00:59:26,667
or meetings that are way too long.

1195
00:59:26,747 --> 00:59:28,528
I have found, this might be controversial,

1196
00:59:28,548 --> 00:59:30,790
but 20-minute meetings are a really good length for me.

1197
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:32,591
I have found that the difference between

1198
00:59:32,891 --> 00:59:34,872
what you get done in a 20 versus 30-minute meeting

1199
00:59:35,292 --> 00:59:37,653
is the same, but you give people a 10-minute break

1200
00:59:37,673 --> 00:59:39,414
from meetings by having a 20-minute meeting.

1201
00:59:40,435 --> 00:59:41,896
So I think just really optimizing

1202
00:59:41,936 --> 00:59:44,557
for making the most of every minute of meeting time,

1203
00:59:44,617 --> 00:59:45,958
such as worthwhile for everyone,

1204
00:59:46,358 --> 00:59:47,779
was something we had to look at a lot.

1205
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:49,098
Thank you.

1206
00:59:49,939 --> 00:59:50,439
All right. Thanks.

1207
00:59:50,499 --> 00:59:52,820
I will, I think give the room back

1208
00:59:53,021 --> 00:59:54,922
to our lovely tech folks to get set up,

1209
00:59:54,942 --> 00:59:57,704
but I am happy to stand aside and answer any other questions

1210
00:59:57,764 --> 00:59:59,285
thanks so much for joining again today.

1211
00:59:59,305 --> 01:00:00,665
Thank you.

1212
01:00:00,685 --> 01:00:01,006
Thank you.
