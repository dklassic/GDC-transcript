00:00:03,942 --> 00:00:09,606
Welcome to the audio bootcamp. I'm really excited to be here talking today about signal processing for sound design.

2
00:00:11,287 --> 00:00:15,750
My name is Peter Zenda. I'm a supervising sound designer at Formosa Interactive.

3
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,092
I've been working in audio for about 20 years.

4
00:00:19,832 --> 00:00:27,577
I divide my time between games and movies, although in the last five or so years I've really been concentrating on games.

5
00:00:28,438 --> 00:00:30,719
You can see some of the projects I've worked on recently.

6
00:00:33,125 --> 00:00:40,089
Even though the title of today's talk sounds very technical, what we have today is a creative focus.

7
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:45,152
I really want to talk about how to use technology to achieve your creative goals.

8
00:00:45,752 --> 00:00:51,035
When you're working on sound design, it is not a technical discipline, it's a creative discipline.

9
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:52,896
Our jobs as sound designers...

10
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:57,800
are to support a scene, they are to tell a story,

11
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,823
they're to build a world, make an item like a weapon

12
00:01:01,903 --> 00:01:03,645
feel real and visceral.

13
00:01:04,626 --> 00:01:07,769
We are creating performances, if we're working on a creature

14
00:01:07,809 --> 00:01:08,649
or something like that.

15
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:13,734
And so we use technology to do our work,

16
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,357
but the work itself is actually creative.

17
00:01:17,677 --> 00:01:20,180
So we don't want to get too mired down in that.

18
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,261
Right now is an incredible time to be a sound designer.

19
00:01:25,582 --> 00:01:28,804
There are more tools out than we've ever had before.

20
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:31,486
Our computers are more powerful than they've ever been.

21
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:34,367
We're able to process more at one time.

22
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,788
We're able to do it more quickly.

23
00:01:36,749 --> 00:01:41,652
There are many tools out there that are very low cost and sound great.

24
00:01:42,553 --> 00:01:48,417
And so it's really like I'm excited to be a sound designer right now at this time in history.

25
00:01:48,457 --> 00:01:49,057
It's a lot of fun.

26
00:01:53,238 --> 00:02:00,241
One of the great things about using plugins and signal processing is it has a transformative power.

27
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:07,044
We're no longer shackled to what's in our library, what we recorded, what we might happen to have around.

28
00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:18,069
We're able to use that material as raw source and process it and turn it into something that is perfect for that specific project that we're working on.

29
00:02:21,012 --> 00:02:29,742
It's a lot of fun to be able to take something and use your own creativity through these tools and turn it into what you intend it to be.

30
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:36,009
Why do we use signal processing?

31
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:45,752
One great use for it is to respond to the team or the client's needs, depending on if you are an in-house person or a vendor like I am.

32
00:02:46,773 --> 00:03:03,528
Sound design and game design is an iterative process. You're going to be making things, putting it into the game, seeing how it all works together, discussing it, getting feedback, and having a command of digital signal processing can allow you to respond to those needs.

33
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:10,813
You might get a comment to make something brighter or crunchier or deeper or bigger.

34
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:13,074
There's a lot of adjectives that are going to get thrown at you.

35
00:03:13,535 --> 00:03:19,459
And if you can take those adjectives and translate them into something you can do with EQ, dynamics,

36
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,562
things like that, you don't have to start over from scratch and make a whole new sound.

37
00:03:26,436 --> 00:03:31,160
You can also use signal processing to rescue sounds that are contaminated with noise.

38
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:37,566
I do a lot of recording and I encourage all of you to get out and record as much as possible.

39
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:41,309
I don't always do it in a perfect environment.

40
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:48,195
Not everything I record is suitable to go out and be on a library or a CD library, anything like that.

41
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:53,195
It might be contaminated with traffic or machinery.

42
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:56,696
There's all kinds of sounds that are out there in the world

43
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,596
and they're interesting,

44
00:03:57,656 --> 00:03:59,856
but they're not in that perfect, perfect place.

45
00:04:00,777 --> 00:04:05,158
And if you use something like noise reduction plugins

46
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:07,919
or a multiband expansion,

47
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,779
you can actually kind of rescue those sounds

48
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,280
and use them in your design.

49
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:17,904
You can also take sounds that might be the right thing, but it's kind of an old recording,

50
00:04:18,604 --> 00:04:22,926
and you can shine them up again and use those sounds in your sound design.

51
00:04:25,288 --> 00:04:28,309
You can also use signal processing to simulate distance.

52
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:36,874
I would caution you that that a lot of times is best used, saved for later in your process.

53
00:04:37,914 --> 00:04:39,975
If you're making game assets for a game.

54
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:45,178
that could be used in a variety of different environments, right?

55
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:50,904
Like your gunshot or impact could be in a giant hall, or it could be in a tight hallway.

56
00:04:51,965 --> 00:04:54,267
So the game engine is going to do a lot of that for you.

57
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:56,589
However, you might be working on a cinematic,

58
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,134
and you need to create a train crash that's happening in the distance.

59
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:06,350
you can use reverb and EQ and delay to achieve that effect.

60
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,773
Or you might be making a game asset that's supposed to be off in the distance.

61
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:14,277
Using the right combinations of things can make that feel real and

62
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:17,460
keep your player immersed in the game world.

63
00:05:19,582 --> 00:05:22,605
Another great use of signal processing is to adjust

64
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:25,287
how the various elements play against each other.

65
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,342
The sounds you make are going to have a lot of competition out there in your sonic landscape.

66
00:05:31,682 --> 00:05:38,705
There's going to be music, combat maybe, machine guns, explosions, screaming, and there might

67
00:05:38,725 --> 00:05:42,567
be an event that's happening at this level of the game that is really important to get

68
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:43,487
across to the player.

69
00:05:45,943 --> 00:05:51,885
one of the ways that you can make sure that event pops out and gets their attention is look for

70
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:59,227
where in your frequency range you've got a little hole, some room to work in and boost that frequency.

71
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:05,168
There's a lot of other ways to achieve that also through ducking and mixing things like that.

72
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:10,110
And then kind of the holy grail or one of the most exciting things about it is

73
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:12,335
creating unique sounds

74
00:06:13,115 --> 00:06:15,456
signature sounds that nobody's ever heard before

75
00:06:15,757 --> 00:06:18,158
that they are only going to associate with your game

76
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,881
I know if I really like a sound or like a game I could hear that audio

77
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:25,442
ten years later

78
00:06:25,942 --> 00:06:29,504
totally out of context and I could be like oh yeah I remember that, I remember

79
00:06:29,544 --> 00:06:30,004
that level

80
00:06:30,745 --> 00:06:31,905
and uh... that's one of the

81
00:06:32,345 --> 00:06:33,566
most fun things we can do

82
00:06:33,586 --> 00:06:35,527
uh... being sound designers is really

83
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,868
create a memorable experience for people

84
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:44,708
So you can see the building blocks for sound design.

85
00:06:45,028 --> 00:06:47,849
We have a number of different types of processors,

86
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,751
and these are the fundamentals.

87
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:51,332
These are your building blocks.

88
00:06:52,672 --> 00:06:53,593
You can use EQ,

89
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:56,295
adjusting the frequency content of your sound,

90
00:06:56,955 --> 00:07:01,538
dynamics, adjusting the amplitude and how wide that range is.

91
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:07,257
Pitch and time shifting become very important for creating a performance.

92
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:11,379
If you're making a creature sound, the right pitch bend may make it really feel like that

93
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,381
creature is dying and whether you're happy that creature died or not.

94
00:07:16,961 --> 00:07:18,762
We can use reverb and delay.

95
00:07:18,782 --> 00:07:23,024
Again, a lot of that is best saved for later in the process, but you never know.

96
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:30,785
And then there's been a real renaissance of saturation plugins that have come out recently in the past few years

97
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:37,306
That affect both the frequency content and the dynamics of your sound

98
00:07:37,486 --> 00:07:38,287
the interesting

99
00:07:39,107 --> 00:07:40,727
thing about these is

100
00:07:41,187 --> 00:07:46,689
You know you it used to be you had to use tape or you had to have a tube processor to get that sound

101
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:49,230
And there's some pretty convincing ways to do that now

102
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:55,158
And in a way, I don't really care if they're necessarily faithful to the original.

103
00:07:55,618 --> 00:07:57,119
I just want to know if they're useful for me.

104
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,000
So that can be very useful for making things sound bigger or for taking the edges off things.

105
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,281
The interesting thing about tape compression was that it didn't affect all the frequencies

106
00:08:08,481 --> 00:08:08,841
equally.

107
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:14,582
So if you have something like Foley that has two sharper transients, running it through

108
00:08:14,622 --> 00:08:16,443
a tape simulator can be very useful.

109
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:19,745
We also have noise reduction.

110
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:23,226
I can't stress enough how amazing the tools are

111
00:08:23,266 --> 00:08:25,367
that are available to us now to clean things up

112
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:28,667
using software like iZotope RX

113
00:08:29,308 --> 00:08:31,848
or even multi-band expansion as a noise reduction.

114
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:35,909
We can use modulation plugins,

115
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:39,850
which are getting things moving and changing over time.

116
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,651
I think that's a great way to keep people's interest.

117
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:46,212
You know, anytime something is developing over time,

118
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:47,752
it's a lot more interesting to listen to.

119
00:08:49,648 --> 00:08:54,192
And then we have a broad category of manglers,

120
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,934
what I'll call manglers, or things that are more extreme,

121
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,416
like morphing and granular synthesis,

122
00:08:59,436 --> 00:09:00,897
and we'll talk about some of those today.

123
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,303
And then you can put these together into plug-in chains,

124
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:10,845
which are using more than one plug-in

125
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,747
to create a cohesive effect.

126
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:22,560
This is where you're going to use all those fundamentals, all the other pieces and elements to create something new.

127
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:31,325
And I'm going to go over some examples of plug-in chains as a way to do sound design in these next examples.

128
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:40,315
So I'm going to call this example metal magic.

129
00:09:41,236 --> 00:09:45,699
This first sound is dry ice on metal, which a lot of you being sound people probably know

130
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:50,542
about but for anyone who doesn't, if you apply dry ice to metal it will shriek and scream.

131
00:09:50,562 --> 00:09:55,825
And I find the best kind of metal props to use for this are something that's thin enough

132
00:09:55,865 --> 00:09:56,406
to resonate.

133
00:10:07,417 --> 00:10:13,168
So a lot of times if we're working on magic, having a tonal element to that can be very useful.

134
00:10:15,953 --> 00:10:17,356
That's going to be our raw material.

135
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:24,975
I'm going to start this chain with a plugin from Tom Irby of Soundhack fame called Spiral Stretch.

136
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:29,256
This is a time expansion plugin.

137
00:10:30,377 --> 00:10:35,079
What's interesting about it is it allows you to have multiple voices of that sound going

138
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:35,679
at one time.

139
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:38,320
There's a certain amount of randomization to it.

140
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,244
and what can happen with these tonal sounds that are changing over time and then you have multiple

141
00:10:45,284 --> 00:10:51,748
voices of those happening, you can get them kind of harmonizing with each other in a musical way.

142
00:11:07,836 --> 00:11:11,243
So the initial sample was pretty recognizable as metal.

143
00:11:11,864 --> 00:11:15,552
Now we're getting it out of the realm of our everyday world,

144
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:18,639
something that sounds like we haven't heard it before.

145
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:26,374
Now, some of you may have used Absynth as a synthesizer.

146
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:30,736
It's also worth noting that you can process sounds through it.

147
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:38,720
This is going to be using the Cloud Filter in there, which is a combination of granular

148
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,462
synthesis, pitch shifting, and filtering.

149
00:11:58,313 --> 00:12:00,994
So now we've taken that sound and really kind of made it sing.

150
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,675
It's got more tonality to it, more harmonics.

151
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:08,397
And it's getting outside of the realm of something we've heard before,

152
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,038
which we can associate more closely with magic.

153
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:17,270
And as the final step, I'm going to give it a little extra shimmer with the crystallizer.

154
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:24,958
You can see this is a very dry setting, not much of this new signal there, but I'm adding

155
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:31,265
pitching delays that are going upwards in pitch with a fair amount of feedback.

156
00:12:47,341 --> 00:12:52,283
And you could take that sound and use it as a power-up for a spell that's going to be cast.

157
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:55,824
You can doppler it and use it as an attack spell.

158
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:59,505
You could attach it to some kind of mythical creature.

159
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:04,426
And so the more you can make these kind of magical sounds

160
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:08,988
and rely on signal processing, you'll kind of expand your palette there.

161
00:13:09,008 --> 00:13:16,110
Another sound you're going to have to do a lot of in game design is weapons.

162
00:13:17,112 --> 00:13:22,034
My feeling about weapons is that microphones capture the sound, but they may not capture

163
00:13:22,054 --> 00:13:22,935
the experience.

164
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:28,898
For example, if you go to a shooting range and you fire a 9mm, you're looking at about

165
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,059
a 160dB SPL peak.

166
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,962
You're going to be wearing hearing protection, hopefully, and I'll tell you, nobody wants

167
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:40,303
to wear hearing protection while they play your game.

168
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:49,353
If you see a movie and you played that perfect recording back at the maximum volume, you'd be looking at about 105 dB.

169
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:54,936
That's about the loudest sound you can play back in a properly calibrated theater.

170
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:57,216
Louder if you're close to the screen, of course.

171
00:13:58,497 --> 00:14:03,079
In the living room, you're looking at about 70 to 100 dB, depending.

172
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:08,741
People tend not to play your game at a level where their windows are rattling.

173
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:17,215
The other thing is, you know, our sounds are not just conveying the sense of sound.

174
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:21,317
If you fire a gun, it's going to kick against your hand or it's going to kick against your

175
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:27,321
shoulder. It's a very visceral experience and that's what people remember. That's what the

176
00:14:27,861 --> 00:14:31,723
game designer on your team is going to remember. That's what the players are going to remember.

177
00:14:32,283 --> 00:14:37,426
So we need to use sound also to convey that feeling of touch.

178
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:45,013
DSP can help you capture that 160 dB experience at a lower level.

179
00:14:49,294 --> 00:14:52,555
So we're going to start with a recording of a machine gun.

180
00:14:53,195 --> 00:14:58,837
And I know we need to be considerate of our neighbors, so this is maybe not going to be

181
00:14:58,897 --> 00:14:59,677
as loud as we would like.

182
00:15:04,997 --> 00:15:07,798
So that's a very nice, realistic recording.

183
00:15:07,978 --> 00:15:08,818
Sounds pretty good.

184
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,059
But even if we put music against this,

185
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,900
a lot of that detail is going to get lost.

186
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:20,601
So the next step in the chain is going

187
00:15:20,621 --> 00:15:22,162
to be some tape saturation.

188
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:29,714
A lot of the gunshots you're used to hearing in movies, certainly going back a few years,

189
00:15:30,394 --> 00:15:35,678
were recorded on Nagras because they had that awesome tape compression characteristic.

190
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:42,204
They had those incredible Nagra mic pre's and they just gave it something special. This is

191
00:15:42,224 --> 00:15:46,587
going to compress the high end a little bit more and it's going to let you push the mids and the lows.

192
00:15:48,849 --> 00:15:50,670
I hope this is going to come across here.

193
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:59,715
Again, this is a little subtle, but that effect is going to be magnified further down our chain.

194
00:15:59,835 --> 00:16:02,596
You'll find that you can make subtle changes at the beginning

195
00:16:03,016 --> 00:16:05,776
that are then going to get magnified by things that are later.

196
00:16:09,477 --> 00:16:10,998
Next, I'm going to do some limiting on it.

197
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:15,739
I'm using both the Waves Ultra Maximizer and the Multi Maximizer.

198
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:20,890
I like the Ultra Maximizer because it lets you choose from a number of different profiles.

199
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:25,773
This one I'm using the Extreme Analog and you can tell the threshold is only at minus

200
00:16:26,394 --> 00:16:28,755
2, so I'm not really boosting that sound a whole lot.

201
00:16:30,056 --> 00:16:36,581
And the Multi Maximizer will maximize it across all the frequencies, so you get something

202
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:41,124
that's more full range overall and louder in all the frequencies.

203
00:16:41,784 --> 00:16:44,966
Again, this is not too extreme, you don't want to hurt yourself with these.

204
00:16:51,653 --> 00:16:53,355
Next, I'm going to apply some EQ.

205
00:16:54,777 --> 00:16:58,523
Why do we as sound designers have so many EQs?

206
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:01,707
They all do the same thing, right?

207
00:17:02,048 --> 00:17:03,370
But not exactly.

208
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,974
Like, people are always looking for that holy grail EQ.

209
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:09,598
People love the Pultec EQ, and you'll

210
00:17:09,638 --> 00:17:13,322
see a lot of both hardware and software emulations

211
00:17:13,422 --> 00:17:14,564
of that classic EQ.

212
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:16,026
You'll see it on Foley stages.

213
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:18,108
You'll see it in music recording studios.

214
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,231
This is my current favorite.

215
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:21,472
It's made by Nomad Factory.

216
00:17:21,513 --> 00:17:22,894
They call it the PulseTec EQ.

217
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,122
I basically use this if I want one of two things.

218
00:17:27,703 --> 00:17:33,450
If I want more sizzle or less sizzle on something, the high-end shelving EQ is great.

219
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:36,013
Or if I want to add more beef to something.

220
00:17:37,135 --> 00:17:39,258
It's not a clinical EQ at all.

221
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:49,905
Now, after we're done kind of boosting all this stuff up, one of the things about designing

222
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:56,493
weapons for games is a lot of times a gunshot will have a tail on it, reflections off of

223
00:17:56,773 --> 00:18:03,401
all the surfaces it was recorded around, but we want to have that gunshot.

224
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:08,589
and get out of the way. After we're done firing the gun, that gun isn't really relevant anymore.

225
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:13,912
What's more relevant is the shots that are coming in toward us, people screaming, explosions,

226
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:20,655
maybe us reloading the gun. So we can use a transient control plug-in

227
00:18:21,176 --> 00:18:25,238
to dial down the tail on that and let our beefier gunshots come out.

228
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,555
You can see the tail on that is,

229
00:18:30,495 --> 00:18:32,557
certainly in this environment, almost entirely gone.

230
00:18:33,457 --> 00:18:35,038
The Native Instruments Transient Master

231
00:18:35,138 --> 00:18:38,801
is an incredibly powerful tool with three knobs,

232
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:40,382
one of them being gain.

233
00:18:41,402 --> 00:18:43,784
I'd encourage all of you to experiment with that.

234
00:18:43,804 --> 00:18:49,007
And then if we keep this chain exactly the same

235
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:52,950
and pitch this, we can come out with a totally different gun.

236
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,631
Sounds like a completely different caliber.

237
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:05,104
The same kind of processing will work for impacts also.

238
00:19:05,565 --> 00:19:08,911
Here is a realistic stab recorded on the Foley stage.

239
00:19:13,482 --> 00:19:19,165
Pretty cool, has a lot of nice detail to it, a lot of nice gush, some blade in there, but

240
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:25,127
again if you are playing a game where there's a lot of foley and running around and explosions

241
00:19:25,187 --> 00:19:31,750
and gunshots and music going on, you may only hear the top couple of dB of that sound, everything

242
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,790
else may be lost.

243
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:37,412
So you'll want to bring out that detail with those same kind of plugins.

244
00:19:40,923 --> 00:19:43,765
Now it's almost like, you know, we can hear the cartilage ripping in there.

245
00:19:45,947 --> 00:19:48,609
So this is the violent section of today's talk.

246
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:59,418
So next I want to talk about how to take a very mundane sound that we're all so used

247
00:19:59,438 --> 00:20:03,382
to hearing that we don't even hear it anymore and turn it into something totally different.

248
00:20:05,724 --> 00:20:09,066
We're going to take a refrigerator and turn it into a force field.

249
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,401
This is like the nastiest picture of a refrigerator I could find.

250
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,741
Looks like, you know, I'm afraid to open it.

251
00:20:16,781 --> 00:20:18,061
I don't know what I'm going to find in there.

252
00:20:19,142 --> 00:20:20,682
So here's the original sound.

253
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:30,204
You can hear it has like a little bit of a low end throb to it.

254
00:20:30,504 --> 00:20:32,265
Some interesting frequencies.

255
00:20:34,185 --> 00:20:39,187
Next I'm going to use another of Tom Irby's plug-ins called Pitch Sift.

256
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:42,027
And I'm not even going to be pitch shifting with it.

257
00:20:42,147 --> 00:20:45,290
It has a partial gate control on it that's pretty interesting.

258
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,354
It allows you to let the more dominant frequencies come through

259
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:53,357
and it's going to filter out any of the low level detail.

260
00:20:53,938 --> 00:20:57,701
Some of that low level detail is what makes it sound real to us.

261
00:20:57,781 --> 00:21:00,643
It's like what our ears are used to hearing and if you take that away

262
00:21:01,184 --> 00:21:04,086
already it's going to sound like something we haven't heard before.

263
00:21:13,602 --> 00:21:19,323
If you listen, this sound has a very strong whine or fundamental frequency to it.

264
00:21:28,364 --> 00:21:30,365
You can see what that partial gate is doing here.

265
00:21:30,565 --> 00:21:34,445
On the left is the original sound and on the right is the processed sound.

266
00:21:36,386 --> 00:21:41,787
Now I'm going to take that fundamental frequency, that whine, and I'm going to use...

267
00:21:44,175 --> 00:21:49,338
filter freak to notch that out. I'm going to put a band reject filter right at that frequency,

268
00:21:49,998 --> 00:21:55,201
but I don't just want to get rid of it. I'm going to actually use that low-end throb that's making

269
00:21:55,241 --> 00:22:00,524
the volume go up and down, and I'm going to put an envelope follower on the frequency and modulate

270
00:22:00,564 --> 00:22:05,347
that, so that part of the time the band reject filter is going to be getting rid of it, part of

271
00:22:05,387 --> 00:22:10,850
the time it's going to let it go through. We do a lot of additive EQ, but you can do some really

272
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,551
cool stuff subtractively as well.

273
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:26,509
Next I'm going to apply a pretty simple delay effect.

274
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:30,722
These are very short delays which can give you a robotic sound.

275
00:22:42,964 --> 00:22:44,905
Now let's take it another step further.

276
00:22:44,925 --> 00:22:47,827
We're kind of getting more into the sci-fi realm now.

277
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,048
It's starting to feel pretty good.

278
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,570
We're going to use a little bit more absinthe on it.

279
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,873
This is running through their Super Comb processor.

280
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:12,752
You can hear as the comb filter is filtering out various frequencies and that's kind of modulating around

281
00:23:13,153 --> 00:23:17,015
that you're getting some singing frequencies, some frequencies that were fighting with each other

282
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,996
aren't anymore and they're allowing a little more low-end to come through.

283
00:23:22,437 --> 00:23:27,299
And that might be a really great effect for a level where we are exploring, where we're

284
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:32,682
not in combat, where we can have some suspense and have a quiet moment.

285
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,682
But maybe it's not that kind of a scene.

286
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:38,223
Maybe we need to have something with a little more edge

287
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:41,485
and be able to compete with a few more sounds

288
00:23:41,525 --> 00:23:42,586
going on at the same time.

289
00:23:42,606 --> 00:23:46,368
I'm going to start with the FabFilter Saturn.

290
00:23:46,828 --> 00:23:48,549
It's a pretty useful plug-in that

291
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:51,471
allows you to do saturation and distortion

292
00:23:52,112 --> 00:23:53,592
in a multiband kind of way.

293
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,815
What I also really like about it is you can have modulators.

294
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:07,166
And what we're going to do here is modulate the crossover frequencies of the band that I'm putting the saturation and distortion on.

295
00:24:08,187 --> 00:24:13,510
That's going to allow that band of distortion to sort of move around based on the LFO.

296
00:24:15,392 --> 00:24:19,495
And after that I'm going to run it through the BlueCat MB7, which I'll show you after this.

297
00:24:37,954 --> 00:24:42,381
Already that saturation and distortion is giving it a more aggressive or edgier sound.

298
00:24:45,004 --> 00:24:51,605
What I like about the MB7 is it allows you to use VST plugins in a multiband way.

299
00:24:51,685 --> 00:24:57,206
So it splits the sound into four frequencies and allows you to put two VST plugins on each frequency.

300
00:24:57,486 --> 00:25:03,587
And the other cool thing is I'm a Pro Tools user, it allows me to use VST plugins inside of Pro Tools.

301
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:09,828
What I'm doing here is applying some compression on the very low frequency.

302
00:25:10,028 --> 00:25:13,289
I'm keeping that low-end rumble from eating up my headroom.

303
00:25:14,206 --> 00:25:18,109
and I'm doing a little bit of chorus on the low mids and leaving everything else alone.

304
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,671
So just to play that example again.

305
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:40,765
You can hear the chorus thing going on there in the low mids.

306
00:25:43,907 --> 00:25:47,109
Next I want to talk about focused low-end enhancement.

307
00:25:47,969 --> 00:25:52,432
It's awesome to have these big hits or stingers in your sounds that have a ton of low-end,

308
00:25:52,492 --> 00:25:53,832
really give you a lot of impact.

309
00:25:56,281 --> 00:26:02,526
We don't want that impact to rumble out and potentially interfere with something that's going to be happening after it.

310
00:26:02,566 --> 00:26:04,468
We want it to stay very punchy.

311
00:26:05,028 --> 00:26:09,672
So I had an opportunity a few years back to do some train coupling recordings.

312
00:26:10,293 --> 00:26:14,537
Worked with an awesome guy who was with the railroad and was able to do it in a very safe way.

313
00:26:14,557 --> 00:26:18,120
Here's that raw recording.

314
00:26:24,488 --> 00:26:31,972
Now, I know I'm going to be enhancing the low end in this, so I'm actually going to filter out the low end after that impact.

315
00:26:31,992 --> 00:26:36,134
I'm going to use a multiband expander. I really like Ozone 5.

316
00:26:37,074 --> 00:26:39,595
And I'm going to let the low end go through on the impact,

317
00:26:39,935 --> 00:26:44,317
and then I'm going to let it die out over that interesting metal detail.

318
00:26:48,879 --> 00:26:52,241
So you can hear, I hope, how clean the end of that is.

319
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:00,061
Next I'm going to add some beef. I'm going to run it through the Waves Multi-Maximizer

320
00:27:00,341 --> 00:27:03,423
and I'm going to use one of those saturation plugins I talked about.

321
00:27:03,964 --> 00:27:08,366
This is the Voxengo Vari-Saturator. It's a dual-band saturator.

322
00:27:08,446 --> 00:27:10,888
Can really be great for adding beef to your sounds.

323
00:27:19,874 --> 00:27:22,856
And I think we're getting some rumble from the next stage over, so

324
00:27:23,396 --> 00:27:24,937
that's an interesting timing for that.

325
00:27:25,717 --> 00:27:30,128
I think that means we get to play our songs louder, right?

326
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,135
Yeah.

327
00:27:33,683 --> 00:27:36,304
There are two low-end enhancement plugins I like from Waves.

328
00:27:36,424 --> 00:27:38,805
There's Renaissance Bass and Low Air.

329
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:41,806
Renaissance Bass actually adds higher harmonics to things

330
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:44,827
that give you more of a sense of low-end

331
00:27:44,847 --> 00:27:45,848
through smaller speakers.

332
00:27:46,568 --> 00:27:49,029
And Low Air adds a lot of those really, really low

333
00:27:49,189 --> 00:27:50,309
subsonic frequencies.

334
00:27:50,949 --> 00:27:53,190
I find it's really useful to use them in series,

335
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:55,731
to actually run through Renaissance Bass first

336
00:27:55,811 --> 00:27:56,951
and then into Low Air.

337
00:27:57,532 --> 00:27:58,892
And you get these.

338
00:27:59,683 --> 00:28:05,585
you know, harmonizing low-end tones that are pretty cool and they're great for this.

339
00:28:05,605 --> 00:28:07,686
They're also really awesome on creature vocals.

340
00:28:15,548 --> 00:28:24,570
I'm just going to play that one more time since the rumbling stopped.

341
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:28,211
So you can see there is actually a lot of rumble all the way through to the end of this one.

342
00:28:29,449 --> 00:28:35,994
And I'm going to do that same process again. I'm going to use multiband expansion to let it hit and then get out of the way

343
00:28:41,337 --> 00:28:44,280
We work on a lot of things that are very fast paced

344
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:49,283
We need to like hit and then maybe a few frames or you know seconds later

345
00:28:49,303 --> 00:28:50,845
We're going to have another hit right after that

346
00:28:50,945 --> 00:28:55,708
So this can be a useful way to make sure that you're not kind of falling all over yourself with

347
00:28:56,449 --> 00:28:57,810
impacts running into each other

348
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:03,840
Next, I'm going to talk about granular synthesis.

349
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,402
It's somewhat esoteric, but none of us here should be intimidated to play around with it.

350
00:29:10,002 --> 00:29:14,544
What granular synthesis does, it divides your sound up into grains.

351
00:29:14,824 --> 00:29:19,626
Those grains can be a second of your sound, it can be just a few samples of your sound.

352
00:29:21,147 --> 00:29:22,067
There's a lot of granular...

353
00:29:23,005 --> 00:29:27,510
plugins out there. They allow you to control how big those grains are, where

354
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:31,995
the start and end points are, how much pitch variation there is, if you want

355
00:29:32,055 --> 00:29:37,741
pitch randomization, how many of these grains are playing at one time, how much

356
00:29:37,801 --> 00:29:40,864
feedback there is in that, like if you're pitching downward is it going to keep

357
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,286
pitching downward more and more.

358
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:48,287
and also some of them will allow you to quantize those pitches.

359
00:29:48,588 --> 00:29:51,950
So granular synthesis can get really atonal really quickly

360
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,632
and the quantizing granular synth can let our

361
00:29:56,152 --> 00:30:00,055
western ears attune to something that's more on a musical scale.

362
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:04,637
It can be really useful for creating steady sounds,

363
00:30:05,478 --> 00:30:07,139
backgrounds, or anything that needs to loop.

364
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,040
I think we're out of the era.

365
00:30:09,561 --> 00:30:11,922
One of the first games I worked on,

366
00:30:11,942 --> 00:30:13,443
we had to create background loops

367
00:30:14,003 --> 00:30:16,985
that were one second long and did not sound repetitive.

368
00:30:18,946 --> 00:30:22,247
So granular synthesis would have been a great thing

369
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:23,768
to have at that time.

370
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:27,850
It's also great for engines, for turbines, machines.

371
00:30:29,511 --> 00:30:30,752
We'll see some other examples.

372
00:30:31,512 --> 00:30:35,234
And obviously you can create really bizarre sounds

373
00:30:35,515 --> 00:30:36,615
using granular synthesis.

374
00:30:39,217 --> 00:30:43,120
So here's an example where I'm going to take a sound that you could not pull a loop out of

375
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:48,424
to save your life and I'm going to make loops out of it. I worked with Scott Gershon and his

376
00:30:48,484 --> 00:30:53,448
neighbor is a pilot and invited us to come over and record the jet that he pilots. So we went

377
00:30:53,488 --> 00:30:57,551
over to that hangar and we recorded some sounds that were something like this.

378
00:31:15,424 --> 00:31:16,945
So that pitch is changing all the time.

379
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:20,168
There's really, there's no way traditionally to loop that.

380
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:23,991
I'm gonna use a plugin from GRM Tools called their Freeze.

381
00:31:26,044 --> 00:31:29,686
And what that allows us to do is load a certain amount of that sound into RAM

382
00:31:30,226 --> 00:31:32,768
and then choose how much of that we're going to play back.

383
00:31:32,828 --> 00:31:36,791
We can be very tight with it so it's just a few samples.

384
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:41,874
This is set up to have 16 loops of that grain playing back at one time

385
00:31:42,515 --> 00:31:44,796
and there's a certain amount of randomization between them

386
00:31:45,377 --> 00:31:48,959
so by kind of piling those layers up together we can create something that

387
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,281
doesn't sound like it's repeating.

388
00:31:52,365 --> 00:31:56,469
and I was able to pull out a number of loops at different RPMs.

389
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:01,974
It's awesome if we're creating something and we get to go out and do custom recordings

390
00:32:02,014 --> 00:32:08,239
for the game and we're going to get steady RPMs at various intervals, but you don't always

391
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:09,120
have that to work with.

392
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,863
And here's a way you can sort of pull out those kind of assets.

393
00:32:30,504 --> 00:32:32,665
So again, that doesn't work perfectly for everything.

394
00:32:32,745 --> 00:32:33,985
Might not be great for a car,

395
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:35,746
but for something like a jet turbine,

396
00:32:35,806 --> 00:32:40,088
it actually works quite well.

397
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:41,829
Now we're gonna kill two birds with one stone

398
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:44,350
and talk about whooshes and granular synthesis

399
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:45,310
at the same time.

400
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:47,951
You know, you're gonna be called on

401
00:32:47,971 --> 00:32:49,952
to create a lot of whooshes in your career,

402
00:32:49,972 --> 00:32:52,233
a lot of things moving through the screen

403
00:32:52,473 --> 00:32:54,634
or attacks that are gonna move out or away.

404
00:32:56,455 --> 00:32:56,815
And you'll.

405
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:01,673
You know, it's been happening for years, people use animal growls as a source for that.

406
00:33:03,634 --> 00:33:06,315
You're probably not going to play this in a way where you can actually hear it, it's

407
00:33:06,335 --> 00:33:09,477
just going to support another more organic sound.

408
00:33:10,537 --> 00:33:12,038
So we're going to start with a tiger growl.

409
00:33:19,442 --> 00:33:24,545
And by using the freeze plugin, I'm actually going to kind of perform with it.

410
00:33:24,852 --> 00:33:30,073
I'm going to move the grains around and I can create a whole bunch of steady source

411
00:33:30,493 --> 00:33:32,734
that I'm then going to be able to run through a Doppler.

412
00:33:45,796 --> 00:33:51,237
So, this still has the characteristic of the growl, it has some of that vocal quality,

413
00:33:51,317 --> 00:33:54,177
but it's steady enough that we're going to be able to make whooshes with it.

414
00:33:57,255 --> 00:33:58,576
So here's my Doppler chain.

415
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:00,736
You're going to see a lot of different plugins there.

416
00:34:02,517 --> 00:34:05,498
The linchpin, of course, is the GRM Tools Doppler.

417
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:09,459
The salty grain is giving me a little bit more variation.

418
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:12,099
You can see in the lower right, I'm

419
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,760
using a plugin called DMG Pitch Funk that just

420
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,261
has a long, slow LFO moving the pitch up and down.

421
00:34:19,573 --> 00:34:26,078
I'm doing dynamics processing to sort of bring it out after it goes through the Doppler plug-in because it can be very peaky

422
00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:30,441
I'm doing some saturation with the FAD filter Saturn

423
00:34:31,462 --> 00:34:36,025
I'm using some the plug-in mix octaplexer. It can be really useful to have

424
00:34:36,966 --> 00:34:42,510
Something that's an octave down. So it's harmonically related to your material but supports it with more low-end

425
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:48,897
If I'm doing Dopplers, I really like to have an envelope following filter after them

426
00:34:50,738 --> 00:34:53,659
Some of that is built into the Doppler plug-in itself

427
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:57,981
But I actually find it's useful to have another one that I have control over

428
00:34:59,342 --> 00:35:03,783
It's nice that it makes it feel like it's further away when it's on the further away part of the Doppler

429
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:08,545
But also that filter opening and closing can have a vocal quality

430
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:11,947
That can just make your material that much more expressive

431
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:15,172
I am using some chorus on this.

432
00:35:16,193 --> 00:35:22,803
Again, not appropriate for every project, but for something that allows you to be a little bit sci-fi that can give it more motion.

433
00:35:23,965 --> 00:35:26,188
Doing a couple different kinds of low-end enhancements.

434
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:36,418
And the other nice thing is if you're using Nomad's Magma plugin, it has an entire modulation page in it.

435
00:35:36,959 --> 00:35:44,587
So I have eight different LFOs assigned to different parameters, such as how fast the Doppler is moving,

436
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:50,293
how much the pitch is changing, I'm varying how much low-end boosting I'm doing.

437
00:35:51,194 --> 00:35:53,736
and anything you can do to get it moving,

438
00:35:53,857 --> 00:35:55,818
like just get things changing over time,

439
00:35:56,419 --> 00:35:58,821
you can run that for five minutes

440
00:35:59,002 --> 00:36:02,625
and come up with a whole variety of material very quickly.

441
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:06,429
So here's what that material sounds like

442
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:07,430
going through the chain.

443
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:08,911
Here's a few different examples

444
00:36:08,931 --> 00:36:10,293
of the whooshes you could get from that.

445
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:47,687
So those would be great on a spaceship or maybe things flying past the screen if you're going through a wormhole through space and time.

446
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:53,869
That kind of stuff, granular synthesis and Doppler can create a whole range of interesting things for you.

447
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:02,372
Another plugin you can use to create some interesting new raw material to work with is Morphing.

448
00:37:03,573 --> 00:37:08,534
This is where you're going to combine frequency and amplitude information between two sounds.

449
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:15,989
Just as a tip, I find it's really useful to have independent pitch control over those two sources.

450
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:22,211
Wherever you have common frequency content, that's what's going to go through the morph.

451
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:27,332
If you don't have much in common between those two sources, not that much is going to come out.

452
00:37:28,392 --> 00:37:34,714
So being able to either have those on a sampler or have a pitch shifter, I'm using loopers for this,

453
00:37:35,174 --> 00:37:39,255
and I'm able to control the pitch of each of those independently.

454
00:37:40,766 --> 00:37:48,249
And what I like about that is it lets me record for a minute and pull out all these little gems that are going to pop out of there.

455
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:51,951
So this is using my voice morphed against itself.

456
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:55,913
I'm not going to play the original source because that would just be embarrassing.

457
00:37:56,933 --> 00:38:03,337
But so you know this is just two human voices at different pitches interacting with each other.

458
00:38:11,448 --> 00:38:11,510
you

459
00:38:31,899 --> 00:38:34,360
So, you know, you can create a whole range of things.

460
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,461
You can use two voices against each other,

461
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,422
animals and human voice,

462
00:38:38,722 --> 00:38:40,643
animals and other kinds of animals.

463
00:38:41,184 --> 00:38:42,885
You can combine it with metal sounds,

464
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:46,146
things that are tonal tend to sound pretty good

465
00:38:46,206 --> 00:38:48,287
when you're using the morphing plugin.

466
00:38:49,228 --> 00:38:51,609
Here's another example where we can take an evil laugh

467
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:54,150
and morph it against some more metal.

468
00:38:55,571 --> 00:38:58,412
Hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee hee!

469
00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:02,991
And this is just a metal rock recorded at the Foley stage.

470
00:39:11,861 --> 00:39:12,762
Through the Morph plug-in.

471
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,072
A lot of times we're going to be asked to work on an object that needs to function like

472
00:39:23,112 --> 00:39:28,534
a character, whether it's a ship that's going to creak as it's sinking, or a door that's

473
00:39:28,554 --> 00:39:30,595
going to open, or a robot.

474
00:39:31,715 --> 00:39:36,437
Being able to take something that has a human element and apply it to those more organic

475
00:39:36,477 --> 00:39:39,118
sounds can give you a very expressive result.

476
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:45,683
As I said, it's important to get things moving adding modulation to your chain can really

477
00:39:46,404 --> 00:39:54,031
Catch people's ears anytime you can have change over time. That's very useful. It's great for creating power up and power down sounds

478
00:39:55,011 --> 00:40:01,157
the other thing you'll find that I do and a lot of sound designers do is load up whether it's synths or

479
00:40:01,477 --> 00:40:08,023
Sound elements going through a whole bunch of different chains that you're just improvising and playing around with different parameters and sounds

480
00:40:08,543 --> 00:40:13,025
You might record five minutes of stuff, and 98% of it is totally unusable.

481
00:40:13,505 --> 00:40:16,566
But maybe 2%, maybe you're finding a sweetener for

482
00:40:16,626 --> 00:40:19,147
something that's a second long or three seconds long.

483
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:23,109
Don't be afraid to do processing that's really extreme and

484
00:40:23,149 --> 00:40:25,190
then pull out little gems from that.

485
00:40:27,729 --> 00:40:33,231
You can add modulation in your DAW. I find it's really helpful to have a control surface to do that

486
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:37,813
you can also modulate parameters in a host such as Nomad Magma or

487
00:40:38,613 --> 00:40:43,616
Vigil from plug. I've been using that a lot lately. It's pretty interesting. I'll show you a screenshot of that later

488
00:40:44,336 --> 00:40:48,178
Also, there are plugins that are just made to modulate like the Doppler plugin

489
00:40:50,575 --> 00:40:53,776
So we can use modulation to create comedy.

490
00:40:53,836 --> 00:40:55,757
Not everything you're going to work on is going to be

491
00:40:55,777 --> 00:41:01,819
a super aggressive, dark world.

492
00:41:02,759 --> 00:41:04,700
Sometimes you might be working on a kid's game or something

493
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,180
that just needs to have some comedy to it.

494
00:41:07,281 --> 00:41:09,682
These are some pretty flat-sounding raw metal hits.

495
00:41:16,044 --> 00:41:17,565
Again, recorded on the Foley stage.

496
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:20,282
We're going to add some pitch modulation.

497
00:41:20,302 --> 00:41:23,404
I actually have two LFOs going here at different speeds.

498
00:41:23,464 --> 00:41:24,865
That's going to give it more warble.

499
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:29,928
And you don't have to just grab from those old, overused comedy

500
00:41:30,108 --> 00:41:31,128
cartoon libraries.

501
00:41:31,268 --> 00:41:33,510
You can create your own stuff pretty quickly and easily.

502
00:41:39,633 --> 00:41:42,435
So that could be a character bouncing around on screen

503
00:41:42,475 --> 00:41:43,936
or one of a number of things.

504
00:41:45,364 --> 00:41:50,527
Technically, part of what made that funny was the sustain part of it pitching up and

505
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:54,950
down so I've used some tape compression and transient modulation to bring out the sustain

506
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:55,070
there.

507
00:41:57,497 --> 00:42:00,239
A quick note, always save a rendered copy for later.

508
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:02,740
That plugin you're using now might not work

509
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,540
five years later when you're doing the sequel.

510
00:42:05,261 --> 00:42:09,983
And also, it's always good to save an unprocessed copy

511
00:42:10,023 --> 00:42:10,723
of what you're doing.

512
00:42:11,243 --> 00:42:13,885
I'll put a muted region nearby in my session

513
00:42:13,925 --> 00:42:15,685
in case you need to unwind that.

514
00:42:15,725 --> 00:42:17,626
Always leave yourself a trail of breadcrumbs.

515
00:42:19,067 --> 00:42:21,348
You can save your chains in a number of different ways.

516
00:42:21,888 --> 00:42:24,389
Pro Tools will actually let you save track presets.

517
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,170
That's an undocumented feature.

518
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,030
You can Google it.

519
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:31,379
but it allows you to save folders of track presets.

520
00:42:31,499 --> 00:42:34,881
This is, you know, I have a bunch of different reverb boxes.

521
00:42:35,561 --> 00:42:37,882
This will call up the 480 and Altiverb.

522
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:41,864
You can save chains in something like Nomad Magma.

523
00:42:41,884 --> 00:42:43,645
This actually allows you to load up a bunch

524
00:42:43,685 --> 00:42:47,146
of different plugins into it, both VST plugins and its own.

525
00:42:47,906 --> 00:42:49,547
And you can save that as a preset.

526
00:42:50,795 --> 00:42:53,418
You can use a program like PlugVigil

527
00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:56,722
that lets you have all these plugins as building blocks

528
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,504
and draw signal chains between them.

529
00:42:58,524 --> 00:43:03,770
And you can also use the VST rack in SoundMiner

530
00:43:04,891 --> 00:43:05,952
as a way to save things.

531
00:43:08,054 --> 00:43:09,055
And that's what that may look like.

532
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:14,954
I would be irresponsible not to tell you in this talk, don't over process.

533
00:43:15,114 --> 00:43:17,136
If you have the right sound, use it.

534
00:43:18,537 --> 00:43:23,101
The correct organic element, if it works, just doesn't need to be messed with.

535
00:43:23,621 --> 00:43:28,145
Some of the best things you're going to find are coming from the natural world.

536
00:43:29,422 --> 00:43:32,526
And then what you really need to do is automatize, right?

537
00:43:32,566 --> 00:43:33,867
This is your learning process.

538
00:43:34,228 --> 00:43:35,950
You need to master the fundamentals

539
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,612
until they become automatic.

540
00:43:37,672 --> 00:43:39,534
You don't want to break your creative flow

541
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,097
thinking about how am I going to achieve this?

542
00:43:42,177 --> 00:43:44,700
They just become automatic parts of your workflow.

543
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,343
You reach for that right EQ or the right plugin.

544
00:43:48,052 --> 00:43:50,854
Your goal is not to be thinking about technology,

545
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:54,677
it's to be thinking about the scene, the level, the weapon,

546
00:43:54,837 --> 00:43:56,599
the character, all that kind of stuff.

547
00:43:56,999 --> 00:43:58,420
You want to get the sound in your head,

548
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,481
or the director's head, or the game designer's head

549
00:44:01,022 --> 00:44:01,983
coming out of the speakers.

550
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:04,965
Whenever you have downtime,

551
00:44:04,985 --> 00:44:06,846
that's your time for experimentation.

552
00:44:07,106 --> 00:44:09,048
You're going to find things that surprise you.

553
00:44:09,288 --> 00:44:12,150
Get outside your comfort zone, download demos,

554
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:13,731
combine things together.

555
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:16,393
You're going to find all these happy accidents

556
00:44:16,934 --> 00:44:17,374
that you're.

557
00:44:18,002 --> 00:44:19,663
you know, when you're not on a deadline.

558
00:44:20,844 --> 00:44:23,646
And then the key there is to turn your experiments

559
00:44:23,767 --> 00:44:26,268
into something you can use intentionally.

560
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,311
That's where the art of it comes in.

561
00:44:30,692 --> 00:44:33,394
Finding the happy accidents, filing it away for later,

562
00:44:33,514 --> 00:44:36,176
saving that preset, so when you're in a situation

563
00:44:36,216 --> 00:44:38,457
where that is the perfect thing for your scene,

564
00:44:39,558 --> 00:44:40,819
you can call it up and use it.

565
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:43,061
That's where your art comes from as a sound designer.

566
00:44:44,445 --> 00:44:45,726
So that's the end of my talk today,

567
00:44:45,746 --> 00:44:48,567
and I'll open it up for any questions.

568
00:44:56,589 --> 00:44:58,710
Oh sure, come up to the mic if you have a question

569
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,810
so we can have it on the tape, the recording.

570
00:45:06,372 --> 00:45:10,133
Do you have any examples of how the,

571
00:45:11,401 --> 00:45:15,922
how your signal flow can change based upon where you put the plug-ins in the supply chain?

572
00:45:16,322 --> 00:45:19,263
Oh yeah, that can actually have a huge influence.

573
00:45:19,763 --> 00:45:23,885
Like I was saying with that tape saturation plug-in, you know, putting it at the beginning

574
00:45:24,045 --> 00:45:27,105
is going to keep us from having a lot of high end later on down the line.

575
00:45:29,246 --> 00:45:31,627
The nice thing about Pro Tools or some of the other

576
00:45:31,727 --> 00:45:34,308
hosts you might use is you can actually reorder those.

577
00:45:36,948 --> 00:45:38,969
And it can have a huge effect.

578
00:45:40,295 --> 00:45:43,317
Another thing is you can, for example if you're morphing,

579
00:45:43,697 --> 00:45:46,579
put multiband limiters on both of your sources

580
00:45:46,659 --> 00:45:48,921
so you're boosting up all the frequencies

581
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:50,602
and you have more things that are gonna

582
00:45:51,463 --> 00:45:53,204
interact with each other, more frequencies,

583
00:45:53,244 --> 00:45:54,965
and you'll actually get more out of that plugin

584
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:57,387
than if you just let them go through

585
00:45:57,447 --> 00:45:59,288
and then did that after the fact.

586
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,891
Maybe you already said this and I missed it,

587
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:05,673
but do you have any recommendations for morphing plugins?

588
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:11,521
The examples you heard here, we're using the ProSonicMorph, that's audio units only.

589
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:19,463
I also really like the Native Instruments Vocator, that is not supported anymore, sadly,

590
00:46:19,503 --> 00:46:20,483
it's a really great plugin.

591
00:46:21,504 --> 00:46:29,286
There's a lot of vocoders out there, Trax also makes one, SoundHack is like the mother

592
00:46:29,326 --> 00:46:31,307
of all morphing and mutating programs.

593
00:46:35,365 --> 00:46:42,006
Hey, so like in that talk you had so many examples of plug-ins and I guess like one of my

594
00:46:42,066 --> 00:46:47,268
issues when I'm sort of approaching getting acquainted with new tech and stuff like that is

595
00:46:47,328 --> 00:46:53,949
that it's like when I'm overwhelmed with like 30 things and then trying to like go in there and

596
00:46:54,009 --> 00:46:59,451
figure out like, okay, what are the parameters that like really make this thing work or like

597
00:47:01,227 --> 00:47:03,653
I guess how do you get to a point, are there any resources

598
00:47:03,693 --> 00:47:07,823
available for just like okay if you have tons and tons and tons

599
00:47:07,863 --> 00:47:09,006
of things that you want to research.

600
00:47:10,296 --> 00:47:16,758
How do you get to the point where you kind of like know what the sort of specialties of each thing are?

601
00:47:16,778 --> 00:47:22,960
I think part of that is, you know, as you buy things or demo things, you're going to find what you like about them.

602
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:28,582
A lot of plugins I use, like maybe there's like three things that I just go to all the time.

603
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:32,844
Like my Eventide DSP-4000, I use that for chorusing reverbs.

604
00:47:33,004 --> 00:47:36,005
Like it's just really good at that, and I tend to go to other things.

605
00:47:36,746 --> 00:47:40,340
for other stuff, like experimenting and playing and finding what works

606
00:47:41,003 --> 00:47:42,870
is the best way, just putting the time in.

607
00:47:43,165 --> 00:47:48,307
Do you get a lot of recommendations from other people or just tricks of the trade?

608
00:47:48,927 --> 00:47:55,990
I'm very lucky that I work with a whole company of other sound designers, so we're talking to each other all the time.

609
00:47:56,210 --> 00:48:01,732
You hear something coming from somebody's door, like, hey, what are you doing? How did you do that?

610
00:48:02,272 --> 00:48:06,413
The goal, even today, isn't to take notes on these chains or these plugins.

611
00:48:07,053 --> 00:48:11,595
It's to take that information and inspire yourself to do your own thing.

612
00:48:12,595 --> 00:48:12,995
Cool, thanks.

613
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:21,045
What kind of recommendations would you have for portable audio recorders and or microphones for when you're doing

614
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:24,250
what you call field recordings and things like that?

615
00:48:25,191 --> 00:48:29,497
I have a sound device in 744, which I really like. We have about one minute left.

616
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:33,662
I really love my Sennheiser 416.

617
00:48:34,122 --> 00:48:35,543
If you were buying a first microphone,

618
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,804
that would be one that I would pick

619
00:48:37,924 --> 00:48:40,446
as a great foley and voice recording mic.

620
00:48:41,487 --> 00:48:43,388
It's awesome on things like big cats

621
00:48:43,488 --> 00:48:45,409
or other animals you might go out and record.

622
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:49,452
There's a lot of handheld stuff out there.

623
00:48:50,872 --> 00:48:54,615
If you go to Gear Sluts or a lot of the forums,

624
00:48:54,655 --> 00:48:56,276
you'll find a ton of information there.

625
00:48:56,536 --> 00:48:57,417
Cool, thank you. Sure.

626
00:49:00,392 --> 00:49:05,659
Hi. You mentioned in the beginning boosting up holes in the frequencies.

627
00:49:05,959 --> 00:49:11,046
Do you have any tips relating to working with voiceover artists?

628
00:49:12,508 --> 00:49:12,708
Yeah.

629
00:49:12,728 --> 00:49:15,268
To do kind of the opposite, to leave a hole in there

630
00:49:15,768 --> 00:49:16,589
for the voiceover?

631
00:49:17,229 --> 00:49:17,529
Yes.

632
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:20,369
You know, a lot of times if you're doing that,

633
00:49:20,509 --> 00:49:23,390
it's going to be in a mid-range frequency.

634
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:24,850
That's where most of the human voice is.

635
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:28,751
A great plug-in for that is if you have the ability

636
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:32,431
to do it like a multiband compressor with a side chain

637
00:49:32,531 --> 00:49:36,512
capability that will actually duck the frequencies that

638
00:49:36,732 --> 00:49:39,213
are coming into the side chain, like the dialogue.

639
00:49:40,453 --> 00:49:44,535
That can be good in mixing, although it's harder to do in real time in a game engine.

640
00:49:45,636 --> 00:49:49,838
And I would say probably EQs that have a broader sweep to it.

641
00:49:50,759 --> 00:49:51,299
Alright, thanks.

642
00:49:51,319 --> 00:49:51,779
Sure.

643
00:49:54,421 --> 00:49:55,361
How hard is it to...

644
00:49:55,441 --> 00:49:57,322
I think the cane is coming for me.

645
00:50:00,106 --> 00:50:01,447
So I'll take one more question.

646
00:50:01,507 --> 00:50:02,328
OK.

647
00:50:02,368 --> 00:50:05,933
How hard is it to know the sweet spot for processing,

648
00:50:05,973 --> 00:50:06,954
when you don't need any more?

649
00:50:06,994 --> 00:50:09,096
Because when you were doing the refrigerator demonstration,

650
00:50:09,116 --> 00:50:10,218
there were a couple of times where I was like,

651
00:50:10,478 --> 00:50:11,419
that sounds really good.

652
00:50:11,459 --> 00:50:12,280
And then you did something else.

653
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,182
I'm like, oh, it still sounds really good.

654
00:50:14,202 --> 00:50:16,045
So how do you know when to stop?

655
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:18,725
You know, it all just becomes raw source

656
00:50:18,805 --> 00:50:21,566
that is kind of putty in your hands as you're processing it.

657
00:50:22,526 --> 00:50:25,066
That's part of, I would say, developing

658
00:50:25,126 --> 00:50:28,307
your own personal taste level is going

659
00:50:28,327 --> 00:50:31,908
to be what makes a supervisor or an audio director

660
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:35,348
want to work with you, is just listening to what works.

661
00:50:35,728 --> 00:50:38,209
And listen to movies and games for what's already in them.

662
00:50:38,249 --> 00:50:41,449
You'll find that simple sounds are what ends up in a mix.

663
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:42,370
Thank you.

664
00:50:44,905 --> 00:50:50,548
We need to take a break. Now, lunchtime surgery, Peter is going to be in the room,

665
00:50:50,649 --> 00:50:54,871
so if anyone has any more questions for Peter, then you will get an opportunity.
