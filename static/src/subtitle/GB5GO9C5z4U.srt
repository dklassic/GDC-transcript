1
00:00:05,442 --> 00:00:06,623
Okay, hi.

2
00:00:06,623 --> 00:00:07,943
All right.

3
00:00:07,943 --> 00:00:10,184
So before we start, just a friendly plug

4
00:00:10,184 --> 00:00:13,726
to please fill out the GD survey after this talk.

5
00:00:13,726 --> 00:00:14,826
We really want your feedback.

6
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:17,087
I wanna hear the good, I wanna hear the bad.

7
00:00:17,087 --> 00:00:20,009
Please give it all to us.

8
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:20,949
And also, please, please, please,

9
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:21,930
turn off your cell phones, please.

10
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,171
Okay, so let's start.

11
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:26,812
Hello, my name is Laura DeYoung,

12
00:00:26,812 --> 00:00:30,093
and I'm the Art Director of League of Legends at Riot Games.

13
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:31,834
I'm a visual designer by trade,

14
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:34,835
and I've been working in interactive media for 18 years.

15
00:00:35,492 --> 00:00:38,594
And 12 of those years, I have been lucky enough

16
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:41,075
to work in my dream industry, which is the games industry.

17
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:43,056
I am still so happy to be here.

18
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:44,837
Can't even put words on it, but.

19
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,079
Okay, before Riot, I worked at EA,

20
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,439
and I worked at Ubisoft,

21
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,781
helping to direct the visual direction and UI

22
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:53,302
for games like Far Cry 3, Assassin's Creed 2,

23
00:00:53,302 --> 00:00:54,423
and NBA Street.

24
00:00:54,423 --> 00:00:56,564
And I've been at Riot for four and a half years.

25
00:00:56,564 --> 00:01:00,526
And when I started, I was the visual design director

26
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:03,308
for League of Legends, and kind of for Riot as well.

27
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:09,731
And now as art director, my focus has shifted to managing artists

28
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:11,773
and serving more as a creative stakeholder on League.

29
00:01:11,773 --> 00:01:16,917
And today, I want to talk about a project we've been working on for four years,

30
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:20,419
and that's building the new client for League of Legends.

31
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:23,442
And, okay, we just launched our open beta last November,

32
00:01:23,442 --> 00:01:25,783
and we will be launching the client soon to players.

33
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:27,084
I'm sorry, I still have to say soon.

34
00:01:27,084 --> 00:01:29,727
I imagined I was going to be able to give you a date, but it's soon.

35
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:32,666
And the project lessons are still very fresh.

36
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:34,547
And when I say fresh, I mean we've been updating

37
00:01:34,547 --> 00:01:37,229
this PowerPoint right at the end,

38
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,109
based on developments that are happening

39
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:40,450
back at the studio right now.

40
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,431
So the information we're gonna share is really fresh,

41
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:44,372
and I hope there's gonna be some lessons for you,

42
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:47,833
because we're learning some lessons every day.

43
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:51,235
So the majority of the talk will focus on design decisions,

44
00:01:51,235 --> 00:01:53,456
but I also wanted to share some of the organizational

45
00:01:53,456 --> 00:01:54,677
lessons we learned along the way,

46
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:55,757
so we'll do a little bit of both.

47
00:01:55,757 --> 00:01:55,857
Okay.

48
00:01:57,775 --> 00:01:59,815
So today I'm going to focus on three things.

49
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:03,116
So first is just a brief history of the client.

50
00:02:03,116 --> 00:02:05,676
You kind of need that to understand all the work that

51
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:07,137
went into this.

52
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:09,697
And then the 11 lessons that we learned.

53
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:11,617
We learned way more than 11, but I'm

54
00:02:11,617 --> 00:02:14,838
going to just share 11 with you today for the sake of time.

55
00:02:14,838 --> 00:02:17,659
And then the status of the client today,

56
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:20,419
which by the way is a lesson in and of itself.

57
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:20,699
All right.

58
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:26,480
So before we dive into lessons, let's go back.

59
00:02:26,864 --> 00:02:33,647
to 2006, when two entrepreneurial gamers gathered a small group of developers to pour their

60
00:02:33,647 --> 00:02:35,788
hearts and souls into League of Legends.

61
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:42,032
And it would have been easy to slap a free-to-play game on a web browser, but the team wanted

62
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:46,994
a dedicated client so players would have a stable, competitive gaming experience, and

63
00:02:46,994 --> 00:02:51,916
the development team could add features and build content continuously without disrupting

64
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:52,937
player experience.

65
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:53,097
Right?

66
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:54,878
So a nice contained experience.

67
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:58,132
and they launched the game using Adobe Air.

68
00:02:58,132 --> 00:02:59,273
And I've unearthed some old forgotten images

69
00:02:59,273 --> 00:03:01,693
of the first client, and I know some writers,

70
00:03:01,693 --> 00:03:05,875
they're out there and they're kind of cringing

71
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:08,996
because we've come a long way artistically

72
00:03:08,996 --> 00:03:10,676
since these samples, but I think it's still fun

73
00:03:10,676 --> 00:03:13,277
to look back, and by the way, the next series of images

74
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,218
are a bit of a mix from the very first release

75
00:03:15,218 --> 00:03:17,838
and some different versions that we did over the years.

76
00:03:17,838 --> 00:03:20,779
We couldn't find everything from the very first release.

77
00:03:20,779 --> 00:03:23,520
So from a designer's perspective, this is not really pretty.

78
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:26,212
But it definitely served its purpose.

79
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:30,973
Players could see which of their friends were online,

80
00:03:30,973 --> 00:03:33,854
they could chat, and they could invite them to a game.

81
00:03:33,854 --> 00:03:37,055
They could check out their champion roster

82
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:41,036
and their abilities, augment their character's stats

83
00:03:41,036 --> 00:03:45,337
with our runes and mastery system,

84
00:03:45,337 --> 00:03:48,077
and purchase champions and skins in the online shop.

85
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:51,758
And most importantly, they could launch a game to the client.

86
00:03:51,758 --> 00:03:52,958
They could play.

87
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:56,924
But we had designed ourselves into a corner,

88
00:03:56,924 --> 00:04:00,327
and it was becoming incredibly difficult for the client

89
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:01,608
to do anything else.

90
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:04,851
Immediately after launch, the player base

91
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:07,653
expanded far faster than anyone had expected.

92
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:10,736
And the growth of the game made it very challenging

93
00:04:10,736 --> 00:04:13,478
to step back and dedicate attention to the client.

94
00:04:15,198 --> 00:04:16,539
And teams wanted to add content, right?

95
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:18,700
Everyone's excited, like, let's add stuff, the game's great.

96
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,380
So they want to add new game modes,

97
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,921
and they want to add champion bios,

98
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:24,822
and they want to add patch notes, and community videos,

99
00:04:24,822 --> 00:04:27,303
and e-sports announcements, and everything

100
00:04:27,303 --> 00:04:29,243
that you could possibly imagine.

101
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:32,264
And the team, the dev team, responded to these demands

102
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:34,785
by slapping on tech, art, and audio

103
00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:37,466
without any clear vision for the UX or the visual design.

104
00:04:37,466 --> 00:04:41,227
And this went on for years.

105
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:42,808
And we continued to build on the client

106
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:44,548
because League was always in catch-up mode.

107
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:46,438
When I got here four and a half years ago,

108
00:04:46,438 --> 00:04:48,260
we were actually still in catch-up mode,

109
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,062
so it was really crazy.

110
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:51,743
And in 2013, that Band-Aid approach

111
00:04:51,743 --> 00:04:53,885
was really not working anymore.

112
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:56,508
The League Air client was inconsistent

113
00:04:56,508 --> 00:04:58,890
both visually and functionally.

114
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,472
We lacked a strong visual brand

115
00:05:00,472 --> 00:05:02,234
to tie our different UIs together

116
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:04,256
and set us apart from other games.

117
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:08,060
And we didn't have a set of visual style guides

118
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,361
or tools for our developers.

119
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:13,062
And what that meant was that instead of hyper-focusing

120
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,625
on making really cool shit for our players,

121
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,346
they would spend time reinventing the wheel

122
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:19,848
for each feature.

123
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:22,470
So each new piece of content, like new game modes,

124
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,372
or this was the Rune Combiner,

125
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:26,093
I don't know if anybody remembers this thing,

126
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:27,695
but I know maybe you wanna forget it,

127
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,616
but it wound up with teams customizing

128
00:05:29,616 --> 00:05:30,957
their visual design work.

129
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:32,179
So they were like, hey, I got a new feature

130
00:05:32,179 --> 00:05:34,340
and there's no rules, so woo, I'm just gonna do this

131
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,562
the way that I think I should do it.

132
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:40,607
And the back end was not functional for developers.

133
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:42,748
It was risky to add or subtract content

134
00:05:42,748 --> 00:05:43,888
because there was a high chance

135
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:45,508
that any change would break the client.

136
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:48,229
And this picture I put in this Jenga tower

137
00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:51,590
because I heard engineers refer to the tech

138
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,071
as a Jenga tower.

139
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:54,691
And you would go and talk to them and say,

140
00:05:54,691 --> 00:05:57,492
hey, can I just swap out this graphic for this graphic?

141
00:05:57,492 --> 00:05:59,473
And you'd get this like, no, no,

142
00:05:59,473 --> 00:06:01,334
you can't swap those graphics

143
00:06:01,334 --> 00:06:03,094
because players might not be able to play the game

144
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:04,134
if we swap those graphics.

145
00:06:04,134 --> 00:06:05,235
So it really was the Jenga tower.

146
00:06:05,235 --> 00:06:05,695
Not anymore.

147
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:08,800
But at that time it was.

148
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,701
And the players felt the pain.

149
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:12,663
And by the way, we shared their pain.

150
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,324
And these quotes that I'm sharing,

151
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:16,526
this is the G-rated stuff from our forums.

152
00:06:16,526 --> 00:06:18,428
And I'm gonna read it out loud.

153
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:22,351
At Riot, your client sucks.

154
00:06:22,351 --> 00:06:25,253
GG Riot with your terrible, God-awful client.

155
00:06:25,253 --> 00:06:27,455
And my personal favorite,

156
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:29,777
I do not know what I did in a past life

157
00:06:29,777 --> 00:06:31,638
to deserve this shitty client.

158
00:06:33,398 --> 00:06:37,340
whoever you are out there, we really want to fix this client for you, I feel you.

159
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,943
So when a project has gone this far, sometimes the only solution is to nuke it from orbit.

160
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,965
Really, that's where we were at. We're like, there's nothing, we cannot polish this turret,

161
00:06:46,965 --> 00:06:51,728
there's nothing left that we can do with this. So we hit the reset button with a dedicated team.

162
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:56,570
So this is introducing the art team, that we're hungry to make the client a great experience

163
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,213
for players. The LCU team is quite large, it's bigger than this, but this talk is mostly about

164
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:02,633
the artist, that's who's represented up here.

165
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:06,499
And we collected 11 lessons from our experience

166
00:07:06,499 --> 00:07:07,800
rebooting the client.

167
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,422
And I hope they will help you examine your projects

168
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:12,704
from a different perspective, and maybe even

169
00:07:12,704 --> 00:07:16,147
inform your design philosophy and your processes.

170
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:18,388
And I tried to keep this presentation focused

171
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:19,929
to around 40 minutes.

172
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:21,390
So I've packed our years of development

173
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,212
into these really quick lessons.

174
00:07:23,212 --> 00:07:26,074
But before I dive in, an important caveat,

175
00:07:26,074 --> 00:07:29,637
the development process was not smooth, and it was not perfect.

176
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:32,460
Game development is iterative, and I think a lot of you

177
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,721
know that it's often pretty messy.

178
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:37,686
So getting to this point has involved a few false starts,

179
00:07:37,686 --> 00:07:41,049
pivots, expected and unexpected challenges, all of which

180
00:07:41,049 --> 00:07:44,032
have led to some pretty hard learnings to us.

181
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:46,875
OK, so let's go.

182
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:50,159
No matter how big a team is, I believe the first step

183
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,381
is to identify clear goals.

184
00:07:53,193 --> 00:07:58,015
So having a shared understanding of what you want to accomplish allows artists to explore

185
00:07:58,015 --> 00:08:01,417
different directions while still trying to achieve the same goals, right?

186
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:05,139
We're all like going towards the same goalpost, we're running in the same direction.

187
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:11,223
So the goals we established, they weren't groundbreaking, but it gave us a shared understanding

188
00:08:11,223 --> 00:08:15,725
and we wanted the client's visual identity to achieve three things.

189
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:20,688
First, provide a flexible design for developer efficiency.

190
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:23,872
represent League's unique and eclectic fantasy world,

191
00:08:23,872 --> 00:08:27,233
and most importantly, resonant with players.

192
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:30,053
Okay, for flexible, let me explain to you

193
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:31,033
what I mean by that.

194
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:34,614
We needed the artistic style to be something

195
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,314
we could dial up or dial down and change

196
00:08:37,314 --> 00:08:39,395
depending on the needs of the product.

197
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:42,555
So League, it's ever-evolving, it's changing all the time,

198
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:45,176
and the client's artistic choices needed to be flexible

199
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:47,116
and provide a sandbox for developers

200
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:49,417
to continuously add content, okay?

201
00:08:50,315 --> 00:08:53,255
And at Riot, we do aim to craft every piece of art

202
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:55,676
and make it feel super special to players.

203
00:08:55,676 --> 00:08:57,356
But with the client, we need to balance that

204
00:08:57,356 --> 00:08:59,617
with scalability and systems thinking.

205
00:08:59,617 --> 00:09:02,097
There's not many opportunities to have a one-off

206
00:09:02,097 --> 00:09:02,517
in a design system.

207
00:09:02,517 --> 00:09:03,837
Okay, so represent League's unique

208
00:09:03,837 --> 00:09:04,638
and eclectic fantasy world.

209
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:06,838
What do we mean by that?

210
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:10,439
So we wanted the client to not only represent League's IP,

211
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:13,999
but to actually deepen the fantasy.

212
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:16,040
So there is so much IP going on,

213
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,500
and we wanted to connect that to players.

214
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,806
and have the new client be a sort of extension of that fantasy.

215
00:09:22,806 --> 00:09:25,888
And then finally, resonate with players.

216
00:09:25,888 --> 00:09:30,111
Our most important stakeholder, players.

217
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,914
In the end, it doesn't matter how nice the art is or how nice the design is,

218
00:09:34,914 --> 00:09:40,357
if it doesn't resonate with our players, we have absolutely failed.

219
00:09:40,357 --> 00:09:41,478
Okay.

220
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:43,419
So before we dove into design mode,

221
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:47,121
we had to understand and appreciate the diverse, complex...

222
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:52,289
and sometimes ambiguous regions and characters in our universe.

223
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:58,755
So we have 12 regions in League, including a region like Demacia,

224
00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:03,339
which is a lawful, militaristic society of fiercely proud people

225
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:05,701
who value honor and justice.

226
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:09,024
And you can contrast that with a region like Zon,

227
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:12,667
which is a polluted industrial undercity whose wealth stems

228
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,528
from black market traders.

229
00:10:14,777 --> 00:10:18,338
and unrestricted and sometimes really unscrupulous inventors.

230
00:10:18,338 --> 00:10:22,420
If anybody saw the Warwick update that we did recently,

231
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,161
you know these people do some pretty unscrupulous things.

232
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:28,542
So within these 12 regions, we have a range

233
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:30,203
of champions and fantasies.

234
00:10:30,203 --> 00:10:33,364
So Garen, a brave warrior loyal to his land

235
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:35,725
who fights for justice no matter the cost.

236
00:10:35,725 --> 00:10:37,805
I think Garen's kind of boring.

237
00:10:37,805 --> 00:10:39,646
And then my favorite, Orianna.

238
00:10:39,992 --> 00:10:42,993
who's an intricate kind of creepy clockwork girl

239
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:46,114
and has celebrated feats of superior Piltover ingenuity.

240
00:10:46,114 --> 00:10:47,975
I love Oriana.

241
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:53,397
And at the same time, we have this absurdly cute Teemo,

242
00:10:53,397 --> 00:10:55,858
who's like a mushroom-tossing yordle

243
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:59,339
who appears to really enjoy being the ultimate troll

244
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:00,619
of Summoner's Rift.

245
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:01,580
And yes, he is the devil.

246
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,121
If you play our game, you know it's true.

247
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:08,082
Okay, so we have a diverse universe with tons of regions,

248
00:11:08,082 --> 00:11:09,403
a broad range of champions,

249
00:11:09,642 --> 00:11:10,642
and a mix of fantasies.

250
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:14,483
So how do we achieve our design goal?

251
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:17,804
Represent League's unique and eclectic fantasy world.

252
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:19,344
It's gonna be pretty tough.

253
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:22,405
Okay, so we tried the obvious design choice

254
00:11:22,405 --> 00:11:23,985
in the beginning, super obvious.

255
00:11:23,985 --> 00:11:26,746
Let's represent every region and every fantasy.

256
00:11:26,746 --> 00:11:31,187
Let's try to blend them all together and see what we get.

257
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:32,247
Of course, that's gonna be great.

258
00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:34,947
But when you try to communicate everything through a design,

259
00:11:34,947 --> 00:11:36,708
you end up communicating absolutely nothing.

260
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:41,710
So here the team was working with a concept we called

261
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,151
modern fantasy.

262
00:11:43,151 --> 00:11:46,314
So think modern materials mixed with a fantasy shape

263
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:46,694
language.

264
00:11:46,694 --> 00:11:49,676
And this look was intended to bridge the gap

265
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:52,518
between high fantasy champs like Ryse

266
00:11:52,518 --> 00:11:55,280
and sci-fi feeling champs like Lucian.

267
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,903
And this concept sort of meets our goals

268
00:11:59,903 --> 00:12:02,164
by trying to represent all of League's unique

269
00:12:02,164 --> 00:12:05,327
and eclectic fantasy world, but that's really all it does.

270
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,627
because by trying to be everything,

271
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:10,409
it lacked a distinct visual flavor.

272
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:13,551
And again, we really saw the client as our opportunity

273
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:14,872
to not just represent League,

274
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:17,814
but deepen players' engagement with our IP

275
00:12:17,814 --> 00:12:18,995
through visual storytelling,

276
00:12:18,995 --> 00:12:21,617
and this design just wasn't quite doing it.

277
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:22,378
So, we began to narrow our focus

278
00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:24,960
and identify common themes.

279
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,122
And we started to ask, hey, okay,

280
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:32,505
so what are the common themes and experiences

281
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:34,127
for every League of Legends player?

282
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:35,648
What do they see in every single game?

283
00:12:37,027 --> 00:12:38,828
And that brought us to the Nexus.

284
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:41,771
So the goal of every League match

285
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:44,553
is to destroy the opposing teams in Nexus,

286
00:12:44,553 --> 00:12:46,654
which is an edifice of crystallized magic.

287
00:12:46,654 --> 00:12:48,215
And here's an exploration of the concept of the Nexus.

288
00:12:48,215 --> 00:12:48,976
And it's a nice looking design,

289
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,918
but the design did not uniquely represent

290
00:12:51,918 --> 00:12:57,021
League's eclectic fantasy world.

291
00:12:57,021 --> 00:13:01,845
We kind of felt like the crystals could be any game.

292
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:03,966
And there isn't much of a story to be told about the Nexus,

293
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:04,727
if I'm honest with you.

294
00:13:04,727 --> 00:13:05,928
It's just kind of like you blow it up.

295
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,870
You hit it and you blow it up.

296
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,471
So we didn't feel like there was much there.

297
00:13:10,471 --> 00:13:12,551
But we did think that narrowing the focus

298
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:17,032
and finding common themes were the right approaches

299
00:13:17,032 --> 00:13:18,472
to this design challenge.

300
00:13:18,472 --> 00:13:21,773
But we realized, hey, we actually need a narrative.

301
00:13:21,773 --> 00:13:27,555
So digging into the cultural artifacts of specific regions

302
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:30,695
that brought us to the region of Piltover.

303
00:13:30,695 --> 00:13:34,336
So Piltover is a thriving progressive city

304
00:13:34,336 --> 00:13:35,996
and the cultural center of our universe.

305
00:13:36,653 --> 00:13:40,476
where art, craftsmanship, and trade walk hand in hand.

306
00:13:40,476 --> 00:13:43,478
So Piltover's power comes not from their military,

307
00:13:43,478 --> 00:13:47,602
but the engines of invention, commerce, and forward thinking.

308
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:50,905
So they're kind of like the innovators of our universe.

309
00:13:50,905 --> 00:13:51,985
We love them.

310
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:56,349
And our team immediately latched onto this specific Piltover

311
00:13:56,349 --> 00:13:57,850
artifact called Hextech.

312
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,174
And in our universe, Hextech is a superior technology

313
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,735
that harnesses the power of magic

314
00:14:03,735 --> 00:14:06,337
through a mastercrafted mechanical object.

315
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,822
So champions who can't typically control magic or channel magic,

316
00:14:10,822 --> 00:14:12,642
they can do so now with a Hextech device.

317
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:13,743
That's very convenient.

318
00:14:13,743 --> 00:14:16,324
If you've ever laned against Caitlyn, she has that rifle,

319
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:17,524
and she has a crazy range.

320
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,265
You can thank the inventors of Hextech

321
00:14:19,265 --> 00:14:22,046
for getting beat up in bottom lane.

322
00:14:22,046 --> 00:14:26,327
OK, so here are Hextech device concepts created

323
00:14:26,327 --> 00:14:27,848
by our world-building team.

324
00:14:27,848 --> 00:14:29,828
And in each iteration of this bow,

325
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,429
the artist attempted to communicate

326
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:33,770
that a Hextech device is expertly handcrafted.

327
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,434
The blue is a reminder that the source of power

328
00:14:36,434 --> 00:14:39,897
is magic, which courses through the entire Hextech device.

329
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:41,618
And then this glove, I'm not sure if the bow went,

330
00:14:41,618 --> 00:14:42,639
but anyway, you can see the glove.

331
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,721
The glove followed the same principles,

332
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:47,283
uniquely handcrafted and visible magic

333
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:48,584
coursing through the device.

334
00:14:48,584 --> 00:14:51,126
So the team gravitated to this device.

335
00:14:51,126 --> 00:14:54,448
It kind of became our muse, particularly the glove.

336
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:58,211
And armed with this Hextech theme,

337
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:01,054
the team started to form a shared narrative.

338
00:15:01,054 --> 00:15:01,554
There it goes, yeah.

339
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:06,329
Hextech gives a champion the power to control and channel magic.

340
00:15:06,329 --> 00:15:12,313
And we explored the idea of the client being a physical representation of a Hextech device.

341
00:15:12,313 --> 00:15:17,076
So the client could serve as a magical, intelligent partner that navigates players through the

342
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:17,836
experience.

343
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:18,136
So it works, right?

344
00:15:18,136 --> 00:15:18,917
It seemed like it worked.

345
00:15:18,917 --> 00:15:21,278
So now we had a narrative that inspired us, which is great.

346
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:28,443
And it was time to roll up our sleeves and explore this concept as a design.

347
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:31,266
And at this moment, the client's UX was not nailed down.

348
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:33,487
We didn't know what the menus were going to be.

349
00:15:33,487 --> 00:15:36,068
We didn't know what all the buttons were going to be

350
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,488
and all the interactions.

351
00:15:37,488 --> 00:15:39,049
And that's absolutely fine.

352
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:41,190
We really didn't care about that.

353
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:45,571
We just wanted to get a feeling for how Hextech would work

354
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:47,992
if it was translated to an interface.

355
00:15:47,992 --> 00:15:49,652
So we keep those explorations super, super loose,

356
00:15:49,652 --> 00:15:51,433
but we always recall our design goals.

357
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,554
And after many iterations,

358
00:15:53,554 --> 00:15:56,715
we wound up with a few options that we kind of liked,

359
00:15:56,715 --> 00:15:58,215
but they didn't quite meet our goals.

360
00:15:59,055 --> 00:16:02,996
And again, provide a flexible design for developer efficiency,

361
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,657
represent League's unique and eclectic fantasy world,

362
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:06,517
and resonate with players.

363
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:07,538
Those were our goals.

364
00:16:07,538 --> 00:16:09,959
OK, so on one side of the spectrum,

365
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,679
we had designs that looked like this.

366
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,681
Super lightweight, easy to develop,

367
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:18,182
easy to develop take on Hex Tech.

368
00:16:18,182 --> 00:16:21,383
So it meets our flexible design goal.

369
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:23,303
And if you take a look, like those little sort

370
00:16:23,303 --> 00:16:24,784
of white icons in the middle, that

371
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,825
was our one big hint that this was a machine.

372
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:28,605
So you can see this is about as light as you can go.

373
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:32,833
And again, this meets our goal of being flexible.

374
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,913
There are no heavy, intricate machine parts

375
00:16:34,913 --> 00:16:36,594
that would be difficult or time-consuming

376
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:38,815
to design and animate.

377
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:41,616
And while it's flexible, it did not provide insight

378
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:44,176
into League's unique and eclectic fantasy world.

379
00:16:44,176 --> 00:16:45,577
And I'll add that I really don't think

380
00:16:45,577 --> 00:16:47,157
this would resonate with players either.

381
00:16:47,157 --> 00:16:48,438
So we have this on one side,

382
00:16:48,438 --> 00:16:52,299
and then on the other side of the spectrum,

383
00:16:52,299 --> 00:16:56,100
we have these runes page prototype that was rich in theme.

384
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,721
It totally embraced the theme of Hextech craftsmanship

385
00:16:58,721 --> 00:16:59,642
and the machine.

386
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,096
And during the review, I just want to say,

387
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:03,677
we were reviewing this and the team was liking it.

388
00:17:03,677 --> 00:17:06,078
We're all like, oh, this is feeling really good.

389
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:08,620
And team was on board, kind of like,

390
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,960
yeah, we can keep building on this.

391
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,641
And people were brainstorming different ways

392
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:13,242
that we could expand this.

393
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:17,885
And then someone asked, hey, what if we decided

394
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:21,867
to add another room type to this screen?

395
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:25,829
So it was like, a lot of quiet, crickets chirping,

396
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,450
and people looking at the floor because, me too.

397
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:31,280
Because we'd gotten really caught up in this,

398
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,101
the cool factor had distracted us,

399
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:34,401
and we had lost sight of our goal.

400
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:38,243
Because the design did a great job of translating Hextech,

401
00:17:38,243 --> 00:17:39,964
but it lacked flexibility.

402
00:17:39,964 --> 00:17:42,806
It's a super, super compact design

403
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:44,126
with interlocking elements,

404
00:17:44,126 --> 00:17:46,768
which require each element to be rendered

405
00:17:46,768 --> 00:17:48,709
to look like integrated machine parts.

406
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:49,990
It had to make sense.

407
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,251
And we wouldn't easily be able to add or subtract

408
00:17:52,251 --> 00:17:53,632
from a design like this.

409
00:17:53,632 --> 00:17:53,692
But.

410
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,911
We did see something promising in this design,

411
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,313
even if it was missing on the goal of flexibility.

412
00:18:00,313 --> 00:18:04,054
So we decided to explore each element in this design

413
00:18:04,054 --> 00:18:07,176
and deconstruct them into a visual system

414
00:18:07,176 --> 00:18:08,557
that would meet all of our goals.

415
00:18:08,557 --> 00:18:10,618
So we wanted to kind of take this with us to the next step.

416
00:18:10,618 --> 00:18:12,819
And this is one of my favorite moments of development.

417
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:13,519
I love this time.

418
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:17,612
which is deconstructing a visually interesting thing,

419
00:18:17,612 --> 00:18:20,435
concept, whatever, into systems and rules

420
00:18:20,435 --> 00:18:22,376
that will define a design language.

421
00:18:22,376 --> 00:18:23,877
I absolutely love doing this.

422
00:18:23,877 --> 00:18:27,921
So as a visual designer, having a defined design language

423
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:29,942
helps you make deliberate design choices

424
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,783
throughout production.

425
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,826
It keeps the work consistent and will help you

426
00:18:33,826 --> 00:18:35,547
and your team to understand and communicate

427
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,809
why a design is or is not working.

428
00:18:37,809 --> 00:18:39,530
You will now have a shared language

429
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,431
to communicate with each other.

430
00:18:40,431 --> 00:18:42,433
So it's not just like, hey, I feel like it's this.

431
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:43,033
It really helps.

432
00:18:43,902 --> 00:18:49,647
So in a perfect world, also, each iteration evolves the design rules and pushes the product

433
00:18:49,647 --> 00:18:53,570
closer to the design goals. So by the way, I do think it's great to have those rules

434
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,753
up front and early, but be ready to dial them in as you make new discoveries during development.

435
00:18:57,753 --> 00:19:02,737
So let's break down together in this room what was and what wasn't working on the room page,

436
00:19:02,737 --> 00:19:08,001
because I really want you to understand all of it. So what worked? We like the sharp-edged

437
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:08,822
directional magic.

438
00:19:09,394 --> 00:19:11,094
It didn't read like random smoke.

439
00:19:11,094 --> 00:19:12,295
It looked like it had purpose,

440
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:15,475
and we felt it could be used to reinforce functionality.

441
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:17,176
We liked some of the shape language

442
00:19:17,176 --> 00:19:18,216
you're beginning to see here.

443
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:21,677
The design didn't feel like ribbons and scrolls

444
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:23,637
and familiar fantasy elements.

445
00:19:23,637 --> 00:19:26,418
It felt more like a sharp, well-crafted technology,

446
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:29,759
and we liked how responsive it felt.

447
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:30,939
Players are getting feedback

448
00:19:30,939 --> 00:19:32,779
that helps them understand their interactions,

449
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:35,940
and it was kind of fun, too, so we liked this.

450
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,780
And what did not work?

451
00:19:37,727 --> 00:19:40,490
So the machine metaphor was way too dominant.

452
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:43,733
If we took all this heavy rendered material and metal

453
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:45,334
and put it next to a leak illustration,

454
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:46,295
it would really compete with it.

455
00:19:46,295 --> 00:19:47,756
If you know our splash illustration,

456
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:48,837
you saw it in the beginning there,

457
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:51,119
there would be a competition.

458
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:53,281
And the compact design with interlocking parts

459
00:19:53,281 --> 00:19:54,682
was inflexible.

460
00:19:54,682 --> 00:19:57,765
If we started to change buttons and where things were placed,

461
00:19:57,765 --> 00:20:00,367
we would need to redesign and repaint the whole background

462
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:03,410
to keep all the elements feeling integrated like a machine.

463
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,071
It was almost like too real.

464
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:09,701
And also, we need to have a very specific type of artist

465
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:11,922
around to pull this off consistently.

466
00:20:11,922 --> 00:20:14,264
It's really not scalable, and it doesn't allow us

467
00:20:14,264 --> 00:20:16,066
to leverage all the talent in the team.

468
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:18,628
Just so you guys understand, League is a really big team.

469
00:20:18,628 --> 00:20:20,189
There's a lot of people on the team,

470
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:22,511
but the team is all made up of tiny little feature teams,

471
00:20:22,511 --> 00:20:24,012
so there's not a central UI team.

472
00:20:24,012 --> 00:20:26,254
It's not like everything's gonna go through a central group.

473
00:20:26,254 --> 00:20:27,095
It just doesn't work that way.

474
00:20:27,095 --> 00:20:29,517
So that's why we really had to think about scalability.

475
00:20:29,517 --> 00:20:33,660
So from this exercise, we now have a shared understanding

476
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,161
of what's working and what's not working.

477
00:20:35,562 --> 00:20:37,103
which informed our next step,

478
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:39,525
which is establishing a design language.

479
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:39,766
All right.

480
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:43,589
So to create a design language,

481
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:47,592
we first focused on Hex Tech's two primary elements,

482
00:20:47,592 --> 00:20:49,574
magic and metal.

483
00:20:49,574 --> 00:20:51,715
And as you design, it is so tempting,

484
00:20:51,715 --> 00:20:54,097
it is so tempting to focus on execution,

485
00:20:54,097 --> 00:20:56,640
but before you dive in, I think it's really important

486
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,503
to define the purpose of your primary elements.

487
00:21:00,503 --> 00:21:02,745
Ask when, where, and why you should use

488
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:03,605
your primary elements.

489
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:11,027
don't decorate. So our magic needed to be deliberate. We didn't want it to be simply

490
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:15,650
window dressing, like just smoke, just hanging out, not doing anything. And magic, by the way,

491
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:19,973
is such a fun concept to play with, and I feel like there's plenty of room to explore and re-imagine

492
00:21:19,973 --> 00:21:25,036
magic for our game. You know, for example, you have bright, elegant magic like Gandalf,

493
00:21:25,036 --> 00:21:29,959
the white that communicates comfort and hope. Thank you, Gandalf. And you can contrast that

494
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:34,402
to Lord Voldemort with the sharp, erratic lightning spells. You know, it feels really violent.

495
00:21:36,322 --> 00:21:39,563
And then there's room for whimsical, silly interpretations

496
00:21:39,563 --> 00:21:42,325
of magic like an hocus pocus.

497
00:21:42,325 --> 00:21:44,446
We wanted Hextech Magic to feel like a magical,

498
00:21:44,446 --> 00:21:46,507
intelligent partner that guides players through the client.

499
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:48,488
We want it to be beautiful still,

500
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:50,249
but we want it to feel like it's guiding you.

501
00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:53,050
So we formed three core tenets for our application

502
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,051
of Hextech Magic in the client.

503
00:21:55,051 --> 00:21:56,212
So first, it's viscous.

504
00:21:56,212 --> 00:21:59,233
Hextech Magic tends to stick around

505
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,674
and has some weight to it,

506
00:22:00,674 --> 00:22:03,255
falling somewhere between water and smoke.

507
00:22:03,862 --> 00:22:08,324
It lingers so players don't miss an important communication.

508
00:22:08,324 --> 00:22:11,485
It's also directional.

509
00:22:11,485 --> 00:22:14,266
So it's always moving towards an intentional path.

510
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,668
So as you see in this example, it's not a poof of smoke.

511
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:20,969
Magic has an edge that, along with motion,

512
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:22,330
guides the player's attention.

513
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,050
And this is a really early sample.

514
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,491
If you saw it outside of a container,

515
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:27,972
you'd also see there's a very clear edge on our magic.

516
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,433
Then also it's focused.

517
00:22:30,035 --> 00:22:32,416
So the highest value or the brightest brights

518
00:22:32,416 --> 00:22:34,316
feel like a gathering of concentrated magic,

519
00:22:34,316 --> 00:22:36,937
and a white hot light is used to attract

520
00:22:36,937 --> 00:22:39,698
the player's attention toward pivotal moments.

521
00:22:39,698 --> 00:22:42,959
And here's the magic incorporated

522
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:45,360
into one experience in the client.

523
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,482
Okay, so let's imagine that a player cues up for a game.

524
00:22:49,482 --> 00:22:51,562
They wait a moment, and then the client finds

525
00:22:51,562 --> 00:22:53,763
a match for the player, and this prompt

526
00:22:53,763 --> 00:22:54,963
requires the player to accept.

527
00:22:55,422 --> 00:22:58,263
And around the perimeter, we've used an interpretation of magic

528
00:22:58,263 --> 00:23:01,324
to indicate the duration the player has to accept the match.

529
00:23:01,324 --> 00:23:02,924
It starts from one side of the accept button,

530
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,505
ends on the other side of the accept button,

531
00:23:04,505 --> 00:23:05,105
so it kind of frames it.

532
00:23:05,105 --> 00:23:08,326
And also, I want to add that we define magic

533
00:23:08,326 --> 00:23:11,026
as being limited to primary buttons and important gameplay

534
00:23:11,026 --> 00:23:11,707
UI.

535
00:23:11,707 --> 00:23:14,287
So magic serves to draw the player's attention

536
00:23:14,287 --> 00:23:18,108
to key interactions, just like that timer and the button.

537
00:23:18,108 --> 00:23:21,369
So now that we define magic, let's

538
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:24,670
take a look at the other HexTech elements.

539
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:24,950
Metal.

540
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:30,692
So like magic, metal had to serve a meaningful purpose.

541
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:34,515
And for this design challenge, we

542
00:23:34,515 --> 00:23:35,916
followed the simple rule, which is simple beats complex.

543
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:39,299
And we studied the hextech concept art.

544
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:41,181
And these intricate hextech artifacts

545
00:23:41,181 --> 00:23:43,723
were complex and elaborate designs.

546
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:44,743
They're really beautiful.

547
00:23:44,743 --> 00:23:47,125
And there's so much attention to detail

548
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,066
in every inch of the design.

549
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:49,880
And we love the shape language that

550
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,641
was happening in these examples.

551
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:54,323
And we believed we could extract the shapes,

552
00:23:54,323 --> 00:23:56,844
and they would work really well in a UI.

553
00:23:56,844 --> 00:23:58,665
But first, we had to simplify this.

554
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:04,529
And as visual designers, our job is to simplify the world.

555
00:24:04,529 --> 00:24:06,190
And as game developers, I believe

556
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,311
we should make visual design choices that

557
00:24:08,311 --> 00:24:11,293
provide clarity so players can focus on playing the game

558
00:24:11,293 --> 00:24:12,414
and not fighting the UI.

559
00:24:12,414 --> 00:24:17,597
So we reduced the shape language down to three core shapes.

560
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:20,980
square, circle, and diamond.

561
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,021
And okay, I know this doesn't look groundbreaking,

562
00:24:23,021 --> 00:24:23,822
doesn't look groundbreaking,

563
00:24:23,822 --> 00:24:25,583
but when you see them presented like this.

564
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:28,585
But these were the primary shapes we stripped

565
00:24:28,585 --> 00:24:31,487
out of the Hex Tech door concept that you saw earlier

566
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:33,108
and started layering and combining

567
00:24:33,108 --> 00:24:34,369
to create our shape language.

568
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:36,331
And here's an example of how we combine these shapes

569
00:24:36,331 --> 00:24:39,753
to create simple Hex Tech elements.

570
00:24:39,753 --> 00:24:42,855
And I'll add that we also made some early decisions

571
00:24:42,855 --> 00:24:46,258
about what these shapes would indicate,

572
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:47,418
like they do have purpose.

573
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:53,354
So for example, diamonds are normally used to point players

574
00:24:53,354 --> 00:24:55,616
to a specific piece of important information or an interaction.

575
00:24:55,616 --> 00:24:59,999
So now we wanted to simplify the rendering of the metal

576
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:03,762
so that it wouldn't compete with our content like the splash art.

577
00:25:03,762 --> 00:25:07,625
So through color, shape, language, and motion,

578
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:11,367
we felt like we could communicate the metal and mechanical nature of HexDeck.

579
00:25:11,367 --> 00:25:12,168
So how did we do that?

580
00:25:12,168 --> 00:25:13,929
So the way we did that was first,

581
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:17,400
We chose gold, a color that people associate with quality metals.

582
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,141
It seemed like an easy choice.

583
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:22,302
We added a soft gradient, so there's a nod to specular lighting.

584
00:25:22,302 --> 00:25:26,043
So it kind of hints at being metal without us rendering out all the metal.

585
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:30,045
And then a sharp edge shape language that gives the impression

586
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:31,225
of something mechanical.

587
00:25:31,225 --> 00:25:34,747
So by the way, we're getting into impressions now,

588
00:25:34,747 --> 00:25:37,167
rather than literal interpretations of a machine.

589
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:40,349
It's becoming more metaphorical, which, by the way,

590
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:41,449
will be more forgiving.

591
00:25:41,742 --> 00:25:47,206
when you're designing screens, because remember form follows function, right?

592
00:25:47,206 --> 00:25:47,766
It does.

593
00:25:47,766 --> 00:25:51,429
And when you have things a bit more abstract, it can be more forgiving, and you're going

594
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:54,190
to be able to deliver on that.

595
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:54,491
Okay.

596
00:25:54,491 --> 00:25:55,671
So also, yeah, there it goes.

597
00:25:55,671 --> 00:26:00,474
We saw a big opportunity for motion to support the idea that this slim, elegant line work

598
00:26:00,474 --> 00:26:01,075
was a machine.

599
00:26:01,075 --> 00:26:06,258
And when you think of a mechanical movement, you think of industrial machinery with weight

600
00:26:06,258 --> 00:26:09,260
and inertia that creates a sense of physical tangibility.

601
00:26:09,754 --> 00:26:14,517
So we decided to apply that physical tangibility to our metaphorical

602
00:26:14,517 --> 00:26:18,820
hextech machine-like line work to communicate that it was a machine without rendering the metals.

603
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,404
This is a very early test. We just had this very simple line work and we worked with one of our

604
00:26:23,404 --> 00:26:26,646
motion artists who just said, hey, let me just take a crack at this. He did this in about two days.

605
00:26:26,646 --> 00:26:30,449
And it gave us a lot of confidence that we would be able to make this feel machine-like.

606
00:26:30,449 --> 00:26:31,530
And here's how it all comes together.

607
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:45,650
This is the champion select screen where you can see how we're combining all the elements and balancing them with crazy colorful detailed splash art.

608
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:59,884
So we have at the center a gold metal hex tech ring, which feels like a mechanical lens focusing the champion combined with a magic animation that directs the player's eyes the next interaction, which is the next player picking a champion.

609
00:27:06,123 --> 00:27:08,204
And as we were defining our design language,

610
00:27:08,204 --> 00:27:11,686
engineering and UX were deep in exploration too.

611
00:27:11,686 --> 00:27:13,046
We were all working together.

612
00:27:13,046 --> 00:27:15,367
And by this time, we really felt like

613
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,068
we had to bring everything to the table

614
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,288
and kind of make something together

615
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:20,769
because we don't want to work in a silo.

616
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:24,391
So strong artistic, technical, and UX solutions

617
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:28,473
were being proposed, but we needed to test these assumptions

618
00:27:28,473 --> 00:27:30,574
because we could talk all day,

619
00:27:30,574 --> 00:27:32,234
but we needed something to point to.

620
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:33,555
The team needed a target.

621
00:27:33,555 --> 00:27:34,695
We needed a North Star.

622
00:27:35,202 --> 00:27:37,444
Like, what are we making together?

623
00:27:37,444 --> 00:27:39,626
Like, we need to see this thing.

624
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:42,548
So we challenged ourselves to create a sample video

625
00:27:42,548 --> 00:27:46,952
to solidify the vision for ourselves

626
00:27:46,952 --> 00:27:47,933
and also to share it with the studio.

627
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:52,376
So for this challenge, we created a series of interactions

628
00:27:52,376 --> 00:27:54,118
that the player would experience

629
00:27:54,118 --> 00:27:55,399
getting into and out of a game.

630
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:58,361
So you're gonna see right now, it's kind of a play game flow

631
00:27:58,361 --> 00:28:00,203
and there should be a game in there, but there won't be.

632
00:28:00,203 --> 00:28:01,724
You'll just kind of see a victory or defeat screen

633
00:28:01,724 --> 00:28:02,325
and then you'll see.

634
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:09,209
us transition out. So I'm going to play that right now.

635
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:12,553
We premiered this video at a company wide event and the

636
00:28:12,553 --> 00:28:14,235
entire client team was watching and anticipating.

637
00:28:32,348 --> 00:28:52,653
The heart is the strongest muscle.

638
00:29:19,368 --> 00:29:21,008
Okay.

639
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:24,389
So company erupted in a standing ovation.

640
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:28,810
It's actually, I think, one of our best moments as a team at the studio.

641
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:29,911
There was laughter.

642
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:30,891
There was legitimate tears.

643
00:29:30,891 --> 00:29:32,231
People were so happy.

644
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:33,992
I can't tell you how happy everybody was.

645
00:29:33,992 --> 00:29:36,953
It was an emotional moment for the team because we worked really hard on this.

646
00:29:36,953 --> 00:29:38,033
And we were energized.

647
00:29:38,033 --> 00:29:40,934
And we came back and went full steam ahead.

648
00:29:40,934 --> 00:29:43,535
Art, audio, engineering, and UX had this.

649
00:29:43,965 --> 00:29:45,506
shared North Star, right?

650
00:29:45,506 --> 00:29:47,467
We knew exactly what we were making together

651
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:49,889
and that feels so good, it feels great.

652
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:53,411
And it often translates to like,

653
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:55,032
crazy production velocity, right?

654
00:29:55,032 --> 00:29:58,315
Like, we're all on the same page.

655
00:29:58,315 --> 00:29:59,515
And they went back to work,

656
00:29:59,515 --> 00:30:01,176
solving their respective challenges back at the studio.

657
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:03,298
And that brings me to my last lesson,

658
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:06,880
which is constantly come back to the table.

659
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,221
So for many, many months,

660
00:30:08,221 --> 00:30:10,423
the visual designers and the UX designers

661
00:30:10,793 --> 00:30:14,314
crafted beautiful designs and beautiful art assets,

662
00:30:14,314 --> 00:30:16,494
but there was one major issue.

663
00:30:16,494 --> 00:30:19,215
Engineering had a Herculean task

664
00:30:19,215 --> 00:30:20,695
of rebuilding the client from scratch,

665
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:23,096
and they had to launch a product

666
00:30:23,096 --> 00:30:25,456
that would not disrupt players.

667
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,597
And as always with development,

668
00:30:27,597 --> 00:30:30,377
they unearthed technical obstacles,

669
00:30:30,377 --> 00:30:33,938
and their production velocity was inevitably impacted,

670
00:30:33,938 --> 00:30:35,618
but art and design's velocity was not.

671
00:30:36,618 --> 00:30:41,261
So if you can imagine what kind of happened was we all started working together and when

672
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:44,763
I say the engineers slowed down, I mean we were going forward and they had to go all

673
00:30:44,763 --> 00:30:48,165
the way back and redo a whole bunch of things.

674
00:30:48,165 --> 00:30:55,029
And after several months of work and kind of reworking the tech, the engineers dug deep

675
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:59,231
into the tech and they compared it to what we were trying to do creatively and they discovered

676
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:01,973
that for the lowest spec computer, which we call the toasters.

677
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:04,905
performance was going to be a pretty big issue,

678
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,625
specifically for our motion targets.

679
00:31:06,625 --> 00:31:09,025
And this is really where we made our mistake,

680
00:31:09,025 --> 00:31:12,246
and if there's something you guys take away from this,

681
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:13,486
I hope you take this away.

682
00:31:13,486 --> 00:31:15,787
And that was in allowing the different disciplines

683
00:31:15,787 --> 00:31:18,387
on our team to fall out of step with each other for too long.

684
00:31:18,387 --> 00:31:20,768
This is something we don't try to do at Riot,

685
00:31:20,768 --> 00:31:22,128
like we actively try not to do that,

686
00:31:22,128 --> 00:31:24,248
but we had a lot of rationalization

687
00:31:24,248 --> 00:31:25,929
about why that was happening,

688
00:31:25,929 --> 00:31:27,169
because the engineers,

689
00:31:27,169 --> 00:31:29,710
they really had to fix some crazy shit, right?

690
00:31:30,544 --> 00:31:32,565
And art and design, they didn't want to just sit around.

691
00:31:32,565 --> 00:31:33,805
They wanted to keep making things.

692
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:35,106
So our disciplines fell out of step,

693
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:38,407
and they fell out of step longer than we expected.

694
00:31:38,407 --> 00:31:41,448
We should have constantly performed reality checks

695
00:31:41,448 --> 00:31:43,709
and closely collaborated with engineering,

696
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:46,210
testing the tech, critiquing the work and the build,

697
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:49,511
and trying different methods to achieve similar results.

698
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:52,592
So it's not enough to just bring everyone to the table.

699
00:31:52,592 --> 00:31:54,233
You have to keep talking, sharing,

700
00:31:54,233 --> 00:31:55,653
and testing each other's work.

701
00:31:55,653 --> 00:31:57,114
Like even if you fall out of step with each other,

702
00:31:57,114 --> 00:31:58,675
you need to find time to come back together again.

703
00:31:59,438 --> 00:32:03,840
whenever you can, as much as you can to talk and make sure everything is still in sync.

704
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,821
So, the client is still in beta, and we're analyzing player feedback and pain now. So

705
00:32:09,821 --> 00:32:16,303
let's revisit our design goals and take a hard look at the project. First, provide a flexible

706
00:32:16,303 --> 00:32:22,164
design for developer efficiency. Represent League's unique and eclectic fantasy world,

707
00:32:22,164 --> 00:32:24,145
and resonant with players.

708
00:32:27,663 --> 00:32:29,985
Provide a flexible design for developer efficiency.

709
00:32:29,985 --> 00:32:33,767
Okay, holistically, we believe we delivered on this goal.

710
00:32:33,767 --> 00:32:36,549
This lighter weight Hextech design system

711
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:38,531
provides a sandbox for developers

712
00:32:38,531 --> 00:32:40,032
to create and launch new content.

713
00:32:40,032 --> 00:32:42,254
And they can do so while maintaining

714
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:43,375
a consistent look and feel.

715
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,256
So we feel really good about this.

716
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:48,178
The designers crafted style guides and toolkits,

717
00:32:48,178 --> 00:32:49,579
and by the way, some of them are here today,

718
00:32:49,579 --> 00:32:51,461
so they're gonna be able to share them with you,

719
00:32:51,461 --> 00:32:52,842
to provide guidance to the teams.

720
00:32:53,225 --> 00:32:55,867
And we've shared these style guides on behalf,

721
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:57,528
so you can check them out there.

722
00:32:57,528 --> 00:32:59,250
Those are the really edited ones.

723
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,210
We have some pretty detailed stuff.

724
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:03,452
And however, there are some limitations

725
00:33:03,452 --> 00:33:04,313
to our current iteration.

726
00:33:04,313 --> 00:33:05,774
I want to share that too.

727
00:33:05,774 --> 00:33:08,436
We currently, for example, have a super tight color palette,

728
00:33:08,436 --> 00:33:11,238
which is blue and gold, which limits our ability

729
00:33:11,238 --> 00:33:13,900
to communicate different types of design elements

730
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,241
and their purpose.

731
00:33:15,241 --> 00:33:17,642
For example, in the client, we originally

732
00:33:17,642 --> 00:33:20,444
planned to have gold be only used for containers,

733
00:33:20,444 --> 00:33:21,745
like important information.

734
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:26,121
But sometimes now, it's also used to indicate an interactive element.

735
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:28,622
And this can be confusing for players,

736
00:33:28,622 --> 00:33:31,523
and it's a direct result of us not having enough colors and elements

737
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:34,044
even to play with. So that's something we want to revisit.

738
00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:35,404
Represent League's unique and eclectic fantasy world.

739
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:40,666
We've received positive feedback from players

740
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:44,207
and the design community on the Hextech theme,

741
00:33:44,207 --> 00:33:47,548
so we feel good about it. We're proud of the design.

742
00:33:47,548 --> 00:33:52,030
But we could have pushed the design further to maximize immersion.

743
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:56,246
And for example, we're using web tech to build our client,

744
00:33:56,246 --> 00:33:58,388
but we don't want it to feel like a website, right?

745
00:33:58,388 --> 00:34:00,350
We want it to feel like a game.

746
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,793
And we didn't go far enough to update traditional

747
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:05,855
web design patterns like drop-down menus.

748
00:34:05,855 --> 00:34:07,336
I mean, drop-downs, they suck,

749
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,838
and they don't feel fun or interactive,

750
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:11,720
and we do have some drop-downs in there.

751
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,803
And then the most important goal,

752
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:18,085
deliver a client that resonates with players.

753
00:34:18,085 --> 00:34:19,927
The players have spoken.

754
00:34:20,311 --> 00:34:23,112
We have not delivered on this just yet.

755
00:34:23,112 --> 00:34:26,273
And while the theme has hit the quality bar,

756
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:28,634
players are focused on the most important part

757
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:30,675
of the client, which is performance, right?

758
00:34:30,675 --> 00:34:33,597
And we've all heard the mantra, gameplay is king.

759
00:34:33,597 --> 00:34:35,657
For our client, performance is definitely king.

760
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:38,038
And right now, we're making all the art

761
00:34:38,038 --> 00:34:41,380
and technical decisions to maximize performance

762
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,581
for our players, so that's a big focus

763
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,542
that everybody's back at home working on right now.

764
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:46,982
Here we go.

765
00:34:46,982 --> 00:34:49,903
So this video that's playing right now is our new target.

766
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,970
And this is the target for our first full launch

767
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:53,711
of the client.

768
00:34:53,711 --> 00:34:54,771
I'm sorry there's no audio here,

769
00:34:54,771 --> 00:34:56,472
because I know the audio really pumps things up.

770
00:34:56,472 --> 00:34:59,333
But this, if you can imagine the last video I was showing,

771
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:01,955
you can kind of compare and see where we've had

772
00:35:01,955 --> 00:35:03,215
to pull back some of our work.

773
00:35:03,215 --> 00:35:08,077
And after we optimize performance, by the way,

774
00:35:08,077 --> 00:35:10,318
we'll be back to listening to player feedback

775
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:11,539
to inform future changes,

776
00:35:11,539 --> 00:35:14,120
and also back to improving the client

777
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:17,142
and adding things back in.

778
00:35:17,142 --> 00:35:18,402
So on League, I'll tell you.

779
00:35:19,012 --> 00:35:22,173
No feature is ever complete, it really is never complete.

780
00:35:22,173 --> 00:35:24,935
We're always looking for opportunities

781
00:35:24,935 --> 00:35:27,576
to improve the experience for players.

782
00:35:27,576 --> 00:35:29,877
So, it's gonna be ongoing.

783
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,578
And there is no secret sauce in understanding

784
00:35:32,578 --> 00:35:35,240
how to improve player experience.

785
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,941
As game developers, we just have to ask.

786
00:35:37,941 --> 00:35:40,142
The world of game development has really changed

787
00:35:40,142 --> 00:35:42,223
and we can get instant feedback from our players now

788
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,384
and I advise you to do that.

789
00:35:44,384 --> 00:35:45,705
So for the new client,

790
00:35:45,705 --> 00:35:47,846
we bake player feedback into production.

791
00:35:48,259 --> 00:35:52,142
So last March, we launched Alpha to get early player feedback.

792
00:35:52,142 --> 00:35:55,425
And then last November, we launched Beta

793
00:35:55,425 --> 00:35:56,966
for another round of feedback.

794
00:35:56,966 --> 00:35:58,887
And that's actually where we got a lot of the feedback

795
00:35:58,887 --> 00:35:59,908
about performance.

796
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,670
And for any League players out there in the audience,

797
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,912
I just want to say thank you so much for testing the client.

798
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:07,054
Thank you for your feedback.

799
00:36:07,054 --> 00:36:08,235
And we really, really hope,

800
00:36:08,235 --> 00:36:10,036
and we're working really hard to deliver something

801
00:36:10,036 --> 00:36:11,517
that's really worthy of your passion.

802
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:15,320
So thank you, and please keep giving us feedback, by the way.

803
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,021
And finally,

804
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:21,065
I just wanted to add this here, that we're taking our design system of Hextech

805
00:36:21,065 --> 00:36:24,305
and we're involving the theme outside of the game.

806
00:36:24,305 --> 00:36:26,866
So other teams have taken our Hextech interpretation

807
00:36:26,866 --> 00:36:29,647
and they've applied it to their products.

808
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:33,067
So Merch has used it for packaging.

809
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:36,688
This is a package that we created in collaboration with BunkoPop,

810
00:36:36,688 --> 00:36:40,109
where the team reinterpreted Hextech in print form.

811
00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:43,250
And last year, the team used the Hextech metal language.

812
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,890
and for the Art of League of Legends website,

813
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:46,451
and for the book.

814
00:36:46,451 --> 00:36:48,333
So you can kind of see it all through that.

815
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,895
So for us, the real test of this design

816
00:36:50,895 --> 00:36:53,618
is in its application, and also in its reinterpretation.

817
00:36:53,618 --> 00:36:56,581
And we're very excited to see how Hextech

818
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,202
will be applied to other experiences

819
00:36:58,202 --> 00:36:58,863
for players in the future.

820
00:36:58,863 --> 00:37:01,786
And that's my talk.

821
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:02,186
Thank you.

822
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:02,546
Thank you.

823
00:37:02,546 --> 00:37:02,707
Thank you.

824
00:37:02,707 --> 00:37:03,047
Thank you.

825
00:37:03,047 --> 00:37:03,427
Thank you.

826
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:19,361
Okay, so I have a bunch of time.

827
00:37:19,361 --> 00:37:21,782
I have about 25 minutes left.

828
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:22,882
I probably talked too fast.

829
00:37:22,882 --> 00:37:23,222
Sorry.

830
00:37:23,222 --> 00:37:25,003
I'm supposed to be 40.

831
00:37:25,003 --> 00:37:26,123
I knew I didn't talk too fast.

832
00:37:26,123 --> 00:37:31,065
But anyway, I have about 25 minutes left and we have two mics, so happy to answer any questions.

833
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:35,106
There are two visual designers here with me in the audience from this team named Kevin

834
00:37:35,106 --> 00:37:35,386
and Ted.

835
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:36,867
They're right down here.

836
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:40,368
And they have some of our toolkits and our style guides and things like that if anybody

837
00:37:40,368 --> 00:37:42,028
wants to talk to them too and check them out.

838
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:44,476
So are there any questions?

839
00:37:44,476 --> 00:37:44,676
Hi.

840
00:37:44,676 --> 00:37:44,776
Hi.

841
00:37:44,776 --> 00:37:49,758
I was wondering if you could speak a little bit

842
00:37:49,758 --> 00:37:54,180
about your choice in typography and stuff like that.

843
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,280
Was that something that happened

844
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,782
after you had settled on your basic shape language

845
00:37:59,782 --> 00:38:02,603
in terms of that stuff and how much iteration you did?

846
00:38:02,603 --> 00:38:04,564
On the typography?

847
00:38:04,564 --> 00:38:05,464
Yeah.

848
00:38:05,464 --> 00:38:06,724
Yeah, absolutely.

849
00:38:06,724 --> 00:38:06,884
So,

850
00:38:08,986 --> 00:38:13,148
When we actually started on typography, even before we worked on the designs, this came

851
00:38:13,148 --> 00:38:18,071
in really early because we knew we were going to have to craft our own font or kind of do

852
00:38:18,071 --> 00:38:22,353
an interpretation of a font because we have so many languages that we have to support.

853
00:38:22,353 --> 00:38:27,236
So for the main font that's even in this presentation, which is Beaufort Pro, we were looking at

854
00:38:27,236 --> 00:38:31,418
the League of Legends logo, which, yeah.

855
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,461
which is very busy, but it's a Serif font.

856
00:38:34,461 --> 00:38:36,041
So that's really what happened.

857
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:37,462
We were looking at the League of Legends logo

858
00:38:37,462 --> 00:38:38,923
and we were looking for fonts

859
00:38:38,923 --> 00:38:40,743
that would be complementary to that.

860
00:38:40,743 --> 00:38:41,964
So we picked a Serif font

861
00:38:41,964 --> 00:38:44,225
that is reminiscent of League of Legends

862
00:38:44,225 --> 00:38:46,766
and then a Sans Serif font for all of the body copy

863
00:38:46,766 --> 00:38:48,847
because that needs to be very, very legible.

864
00:38:48,847 --> 00:38:50,127
So something with a bit of character

865
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,548
that has that Fantasy League feeling

866
00:38:51,548 --> 00:38:53,508
and then something really simple

867
00:38:53,508 --> 00:38:54,649
that's for all of the body copy

868
00:38:54,649 --> 00:38:56,710
and explanatory text and bios and things like that.

869
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:56,970
Okay, thanks.

870
00:39:00,436 --> 00:39:08,343
Hi. Hi. Can you talk through the creative process for prototyping and

871
00:39:08,343 --> 00:39:13,208
creating wireframes before visual design is actually applied to the user

872
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:17,071
experience because I assume you don't just jump right into you know super

873
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:19,954
complex illustrations and how those interactions are actually created.

874
00:39:19,954 --> 00:39:25,619
So the teams like our disciplines are all working at the same time.

875
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:30,481
And we definitely have UX designers that are embedded with the team working with the visual designers,

876
00:39:30,481 --> 00:39:34,803
but I will say that there were some times where the visual designers were helping out with the UX as well.

877
00:39:34,803 --> 00:39:39,644
So when I say that the process was very organic,

878
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:44,846
the UX designers don't hand off finished wireframes to the artists.

879
00:39:44,846 --> 00:39:47,267
That's kind of what we describe as waterfall.

880
00:39:47,267 --> 00:39:49,948
It's not usually how we work, especially not in the beginning.

881
00:39:49,948 --> 00:39:53,029
So when we got to a place where we knew what kind of features we'd have to have on a screen,

882
00:39:53,362 --> 00:39:55,163
they would start putting together some wires

883
00:39:55,163 --> 00:39:56,604
and they would sit with the visual designers,

884
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:57,444
they'd kind of do it together,

885
00:39:57,444 --> 00:39:59,105
and then the visual designers would start

886
00:39:59,105 --> 00:39:59,705
doing some designs.

887
00:39:59,705 --> 00:40:01,786
And we've had many designers even say to us,

888
00:40:01,786 --> 00:40:03,887
it's not always easy to do a wireframe

889
00:40:03,887 --> 00:40:06,369
if you don't have some idea what the design is.

890
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:09,570
So I would say it was really iterative,

891
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:14,153
and over time the wireframes became

892
00:40:14,153 --> 00:40:16,974
more and more like the designs, right?

893
00:40:16,974 --> 00:40:19,375
As the designs tighten up, the wireframe tighten up,

894
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,436
so it's kind of happening at the same time like this.

895
00:40:21,436 --> 00:40:23,117
So that was really what the process was.

896
00:40:23,889 --> 00:40:24,430
Thank you.

897
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,271
You're welcome.

898
00:40:26,271 --> 00:40:26,711
Hi.

899
00:40:26,711 --> 00:40:26,751
Hi.

900
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:30,794
Yeah, I just had a question about making

901
00:40:30,794 --> 00:40:34,097
really large, impactful visual changes to games.

902
00:40:34,097 --> 00:40:36,859
I mean, personally, I work somewhere

903
00:40:36,859 --> 00:40:40,802
where if we have a game that's generating so much money,

904
00:40:40,802 --> 00:40:42,323
we're afraid to change anything because we have all

905
00:40:42,323 --> 00:40:44,125
these customers paying so much.

906
00:40:44,125 --> 00:40:46,106
So I was wondering about a strategy about,

907
00:40:46,106 --> 00:40:49,509
because there's no doubt that the game looks beautiful

908
00:40:49,509 --> 00:40:50,570
and it continues to.

909
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:58,007
to do that but it changes so much and I wonder if there's any thought or weighing the risks of

910
00:40:58,007 --> 00:41:01,570
you know making the game that looks even though it's more beautiful looks so different that

911
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:06,433
players almost don't even relate to it. I was wondering if you could. Yeah that's one of the

912
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:11,036
reasons why we start releasing things early to players to try to feel it out for them.

913
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:16,881
You know we start showing them some designs even before the beta saying hey this is kind of the

914
00:41:16,881 --> 00:41:19,783
direction that we're going so we can start getting feedback and also.

915
00:41:20,801 --> 00:41:22,301
giving them a moment to warm up to it,

916
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:23,922
because change is hard, right?

917
00:41:23,922 --> 00:41:25,202
Change is tough.

918
00:41:25,202 --> 00:41:26,403
Like even if you're changing for something

919
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:27,283
you don't really like,

920
00:41:27,283 --> 00:41:28,563
and I think a lot of us can relate,

921
00:41:28,563 --> 00:41:30,984
you get used to like a broken tool or whatever.

922
00:41:30,984 --> 00:41:32,344
You're like, don't change it, I'm fine.

923
00:41:32,344 --> 00:41:36,146
And we know this, and we're really empathetic to it.

924
00:41:36,146 --> 00:41:38,806
By the way, we experience it ourselves

925
00:41:38,806 --> 00:41:40,107
when maybe a new splash comes out,

926
00:41:40,107 --> 00:41:41,027
it's our favorite champion.

927
00:41:41,027 --> 00:41:42,267
We're like, wait, what just happened?

928
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:43,488
And you run over to the artist's desk.

929
00:41:43,488 --> 00:41:45,148
So we are really empathetic,

930
00:41:45,148 --> 00:41:46,389
but what we try to do is just get things

931
00:41:46,389 --> 00:41:48,029
in front of people as early as we can.

932
00:41:48,697 --> 00:41:51,860
That's our main strategy, get things in front of people as early as we can.

933
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,002
And we talk a lot to each other on the floor.

934
00:41:54,002 --> 00:41:55,003
We play the game a lot.

935
00:41:55,003 --> 00:41:57,906
We're very invested in the game.

936
00:41:57,906 --> 00:42:00,608
And we're expected to have our finger on the pulse of what's

937
00:42:00,608 --> 00:42:02,210
going on with our community.

938
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,072
So we read their feedback.

939
00:42:04,072 --> 00:42:05,013
We really do, by the way.

940
00:42:05,013 --> 00:42:08,276
If you guys wonder if we read the forums, we read them.

941
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,298
And the comments get sent around.

942
00:42:10,298 --> 00:42:11,599
When it's like, hey, I think we should fix this.

943
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:13,381
There's a lot of really unhappy people on the forum.

944
00:42:14,279 --> 00:42:28,246
That's the best thing I can tell you is we just communicate with our community as much as we can and we try to get things in front of them just so they can get used to it and get a feel for how they're going to react to it.

945
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:30,207
Thank you. You're welcome.

946
00:42:30,207 --> 00:42:30,367
Hi.

947
00:42:30,367 --> 00:42:34,409
Hi. Great talk, by the way. Thank you so much. Awesome information for us.

948
00:42:34,409 --> 00:42:38,611
He kind of asked a similar question I was going to ask, but I had kind of two questions.

949
00:42:39,364 --> 00:42:45,269
how do you filter the amount of player feedback, community feedback, because I know that's

950
00:42:45,269 --> 00:42:52,195
that's probably a lot to deal with. And then leading up into my next, which was how much did

951
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:57,300
you guys work with other departments on your team, like art departments, whether it was

952
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:02,184
the effects department and design? Okay, I can answer both. For feedback,

953
00:43:03,192 --> 00:43:07,715
It really depends how it comes in, how hot it comes in,

954
00:43:07,715 --> 00:43:11,036
or how, I would even say how sensitive we are to it.

955
00:43:11,036 --> 00:43:12,797
Maybe we were uncertain about something

956
00:43:12,797 --> 00:43:14,538
and suddenly a bunch of people are talking about it

957
00:43:14,538 --> 00:43:15,439
on Reddit, we're like, oh no, it's true.

958
00:43:15,439 --> 00:43:18,641
And we'll all start talking about it on the floor,

959
00:43:18,641 --> 00:43:21,642
but I wouldn't say we necessarily filter it.

960
00:43:21,642 --> 00:43:24,644
What we try to do is read it and mine for nuggets.

961
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:26,505
So if somebody's saying, oh my God, I can't

962
00:43:26,505 --> 00:43:27,766
like fucking believe you did this,

963
00:43:27,766 --> 00:43:30,627
like we go through all the cursing and get to the,

964
00:43:31,128 --> 00:43:34,490
A, they're really unhappy with how we changed the summoner icons.

965
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,831
It's not clear, Flash is not clear to them anymore

966
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,852
because we made it too orange.

967
00:43:37,852 --> 00:43:39,353
They're just used to, out of the corner of their eye,

968
00:43:39,353 --> 00:43:41,214
it being bright yellow, and they're unhappy about that.

969
00:43:41,214 --> 00:43:43,695
And then we'll look around for other comments like that,

970
00:43:43,695 --> 00:43:45,637
and we kind of mine for that data.

971
00:43:45,637 --> 00:43:47,758
And then really we just talk to each other like,

972
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,559
yeah, that probably wasn't a great decision.

973
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:53,141
It looks pretty, but maybe we took it too far as far as gameplay.

974
00:43:53,141 --> 00:43:55,202
So I don't know if that really answers your question.

975
00:43:55,202 --> 00:43:57,764
I don't think we have a set way of going through our feedback.

976
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:03,842
And for your second question about working with other teams, we did.

977
00:44:03,842 --> 00:44:06,684
So all of those HexTech concepts that you saw,

978
00:44:06,684 --> 00:44:09,185
we work very closely with the Foundations team.

979
00:44:09,185 --> 00:44:11,727
So our Foundations team is like an IP development team,

980
00:44:11,727 --> 00:44:13,128
and they're absolutely awesome.

981
00:44:13,128 --> 00:44:16,810
So they had really kind of rough concepts for HexTech,

982
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:19,671
and they gave them to us,

983
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:22,493
and then we started developing the idea of HexTech more,

984
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,854
and then we kind of handed it back to them,

985
00:44:23,854 --> 00:44:25,555
and it went back and forth a few times.

986
00:44:25,555 --> 00:44:27,056
And we loved this collaboration.

987
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,021
It was really fun to have the visual designers and the motion artists working with the concept

988
00:44:31,021 --> 00:44:33,241
artists and developing a theme like this.

989
00:44:33,241 --> 00:44:40,363
So yes, we definitely collaborate whenever we can, and it's really awesome.

990
00:44:40,363 --> 00:44:42,104
We learn a lot when we do it.

991
00:44:42,104 --> 00:44:43,344
It was very beautiful.

992
00:44:43,344 --> 00:44:43,964
Thank you.

993
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:45,085
Thank you so much.

994
00:44:45,085 --> 00:44:45,605
Hi.

995
00:44:45,605 --> 00:44:46,665
Hi, thanks for the talk.

996
00:44:46,665 --> 00:44:52,667
I have a question about as you're developing the new UI, do you have a separate client

997
00:44:52,667 --> 00:44:53,047
that...

998
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:58,161
you run the new UI on against the back-end server,

999
00:44:58,161 --> 00:45:01,061
obviously just being able to play the game?

1000
00:45:01,061 --> 00:45:03,402
Or do you have a UI mode that you switch between

1001
00:45:03,402 --> 00:45:05,043
Hex Tech and the old client?

1002
00:45:05,043 --> 00:45:08,724
Like, how do you get that A-B testing, like,

1003
00:45:08,724 --> 00:45:10,905
actually done during development?

1004
00:45:10,905 --> 00:45:12,205
I don't know if I can answer that question.

1005
00:45:12,205 --> 00:45:14,686
Can either one of you guys answer that question?

1006
00:45:14,686 --> 00:45:15,026
They're two.

1007
00:45:15,026 --> 00:45:16,947
Yeah, so we have a separate build.

1008
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,147
Okay.

1009
00:45:18,147 --> 00:45:18,547
Separate build.

1010
00:45:18,547 --> 00:45:20,268
It's like entirely separate from the original thing.

1011
00:45:20,268 --> 00:45:22,528
I'll just repeat it what he says.

1012
00:45:26,087 --> 00:45:27,187
Yeah.

1013
00:45:27,187 --> 00:45:27,307
Okay.

1014
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:30,148
Are you testing the client with actual players or is it all internal?

1015
00:45:30,148 --> 00:45:33,609
So yeah, we're doing currently like right now you can run either version of it.

1016
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:33,869
Yes.

1017
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:35,809
And then we did internal beta testing.

1018
00:45:35,809 --> 00:45:35,949
Yeah.

1019
00:45:35,949 --> 00:45:38,270
We buy beta and speed warp out.

1020
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:42,331
Yeah, you could play both versions.

1021
00:45:42,331 --> 00:45:45,572
You could switch back and forth from one client to another.

1022
00:45:45,572 --> 00:45:50,194
Because we didn't want to just flip the switch and suddenly have people go into that because

1023
00:45:50,194 --> 00:45:52,154
we knew like this is a lot of players.

1024
00:45:52,154 --> 00:45:52,254
Yeah.

1025
00:45:52,254 --> 00:45:53,955
And there are a lot of regions.

1026
00:45:54,311 --> 00:45:57,512
And so it's very hard to predict that.

1027
00:45:57,512 --> 00:46:01,614
And even when we roll out, it's gonna be region by region.

1028
00:46:01,614 --> 00:46:02,715
Like we do things very slowly,

1029
00:46:02,715 --> 00:46:06,436
because what we don't wanna do is we don't wanna interrupt,

1030
00:46:06,436 --> 00:46:08,937
we don't wanna interrupt anybody's ability

1031
00:46:08,937 --> 00:46:10,618
to actually play the game.

1032
00:46:10,618 --> 00:46:10,838
Sure.

1033
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:11,538
Thank you very much.

1034
00:46:11,538 --> 00:46:13,339
Okay, you're welcome.

1035
00:46:13,339 --> 00:46:13,539
Okay, hi.

1036
00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:15,100
I got two little questions.

1037
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:15,700
And before I want to say,

1038
00:46:17,245 --> 00:46:18,626
The new client's awesome.

1039
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:19,227
Thank you.

1040
00:46:19,227 --> 00:46:20,888
I've been really enjoying it recently.

1041
00:46:20,888 --> 00:46:22,529
It looks really great and everything.

1042
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,670
Thank you so much.

1043
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:30,035
I wanted to know, for example, compared to the old client where you had the little watch

1044
00:46:30,035 --> 00:46:34,739
window where you could be able to spectate high level players' games and, for example,

1045
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:38,722
the chat that you could collapse and everything, when you were making the updated version of

1046
00:46:38,722 --> 00:46:43,706
the client, what decisions were made in order to, you know, what remained in the client

1047
00:46:43,706 --> 00:46:44,126
itself?

1048
00:46:44,126 --> 00:46:45,587
For example, a lot of people complain.

1049
00:46:45,999 --> 00:46:52,341
We're talking about like you can't minimize the little with the players or friends tab so it's kind of weird for them

1050
00:46:52,341 --> 00:46:57,562
But at the same time I'm guessing that was kind of intentional when you guys mentioned that you want to be relatively minimalistic to it

1051
00:46:57,562 --> 00:46:58,382
But how do you exactly?

1052
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:04,784
Decide what staying and what's not the friends tab was intentional that one that decision

1053
00:47:04,784 --> 00:47:08,565
We made a long time ago, and that's a real commitment because you can look at the design

1054
00:47:09,267 --> 00:47:11,729
it's balanced with that piece in mind.

1055
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:15,631
And it's really because what we know about League

1056
00:47:15,631 --> 00:47:17,111
is that it's a better experience to play the game

1057
00:47:17,111 --> 00:47:19,593
when you play with your friends, no matter what.

1058
00:47:19,593 --> 00:47:20,773
And I think anybody who plays the game,

1059
00:47:20,773 --> 00:47:22,314
you know, me, everybody, it's like,

1060
00:47:22,314 --> 00:47:23,134
I don't wanna play Pugs,

1061
00:47:23,134 --> 00:47:24,735
I really like playing with my friends.

1062
00:47:24,735 --> 00:47:27,036
So that was why that decision was made.

1063
00:47:27,036 --> 00:47:29,218
But as far as features,

1064
00:47:29,218 --> 00:47:31,919
what we're shooting for is feature parity,

1065
00:47:31,919 --> 00:47:34,260
and then we're gonna start adding new features.

1066
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,802
So once we ship the client, it's really not done.

1067
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,731
If you remember how I described League of Legends,

1068
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:41,172
like a really big team made up of a lot of little teams.

1069
00:47:41,172 --> 00:47:43,213
Right now, LCU owns the entire client.

1070
00:47:43,213 --> 00:47:44,053
That's what we call a team,

1071
00:47:44,053 --> 00:47:45,153
it's the League Client Update team.

1072
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,134
They own it.

1073
00:47:46,134 --> 00:47:48,574
But what's gonna happen once we release the game

1074
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,075
to release the client to everybody,

1075
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,036
is that it's gonna break up into small teams

1076
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:54,457
and they're gonna go back to working on new features.

1077
00:47:54,457 --> 00:47:57,478
So you're gonna see things popping into the client

1078
00:47:57,478 --> 00:47:59,478
over the next few years.

1079
00:47:59,478 --> 00:48:01,839
But for now, the most important thing is feature parity.

1080
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:02,159
Right.

1081
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:07,751
And for the second question, now that you guys have gone into this entire thing of developing

1082
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:13,412
the looks of Hextech and everything, how do you think there's an effort going on eventually

1083
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:16,093
to update Piltover Champions?

1084
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:21,114
For example, right now Caitlyn, she's from Piltover, but the guns and how it looks and

1085
00:48:21,114 --> 00:48:26,155
the VFX and everything doesn't really feel like the Hextech presented in the cloud itself

1086
00:48:26,155 --> 00:48:26,975
mostly.

1087
00:48:26,975 --> 00:48:31,436
I think Heimerdinger does kind of fit that because of the bluish things and the desserts

1088
00:48:31,436 --> 00:48:32,037
and everything.

1089
00:48:32,718 --> 00:48:35,038
And for example, Galio right now has a Hextech skin

1090
00:48:35,038 --> 00:48:38,639
that looks nothing like the current precision Hextech.

1091
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:41,020
Are you talking about the old Galio?

1092
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,020
I know they're working on a rework.

1093
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,721
As a player, I don't know anything about it, but yeah.

1094
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:46,661
Wait till the rework.

1095
00:48:46,661 --> 00:48:49,682
But no, I think that the answer is yes.

1096
00:48:49,682 --> 00:48:51,282
And as a matter of fact, Hextech's been bobbing

1097
00:48:51,282 --> 00:48:52,603
around the game for a while.

1098
00:48:52,603 --> 00:48:54,323
There's been the idea of Hextech.

1099
00:48:54,323 --> 00:48:57,364
And it's been slowly evolving into what it is now.

1100
00:48:57,364 --> 00:49:01,525
I would say a lot of this IP work was really only completed.

1101
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:07,075
pretty recently. The work that we were doing, the foundations team was still working on what

1102
00:49:07,075 --> 00:49:12,181
Hextech is. So yes, I think we look for opportunities now whenever we're doing a Champion update.

1103
00:49:12,887 --> 00:49:14,827
we look for opportunities to link them back

1104
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:16,067
to all the faction work we're doing.

1105
00:49:16,067 --> 00:49:16,688
And I couldn't show you,

1106
00:49:16,688 --> 00:49:18,608
we have a lot of faction work that's done,

1107
00:49:18,608 --> 00:49:20,629
shape language and color and culture

1108
00:49:20,629 --> 00:49:22,269
and everything about the place.

1109
00:49:22,269 --> 00:49:24,029
So when you see a new splash come in

1110
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:27,450
and if a champion's from Ionia or from Freljord,

1111
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,071
you'll see that there might be some motifs

1112
00:49:29,071 --> 00:49:30,251
in the background and some changes

1113
00:49:30,251 --> 00:49:31,251
that we're making to the champion

1114
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:33,692
so that they land very solidly

1115
00:49:33,692 --> 00:49:37,013
in what we consider now to be the definite look

1116
00:49:37,013 --> 00:49:39,513
and feel of that region, that realm.

1117
00:49:40,126 --> 00:49:44,949
But it's going to be a slow process because we can't really just update everything at once, right?

1118
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:50,271
Because we're more focused on really gameplay changes that are going to be super important to the players.

1119
00:49:50,271 --> 00:49:56,375
So we focus there first and then we just find our opportunities to keep making the art more consistent across the board.

1120
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,460
All right, thank you.

1121
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,320
And one last thing.

1122
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,321
I don't know if anybody in the room here

1123
00:50:00,321 --> 00:50:03,262
that was in the late client update has to do with this,

1124
00:50:03,262 --> 00:50:05,162
but my dual partner says thank you very much

1125
00:50:05,162 --> 00:50:06,342
for adding the potato mode.

1126
00:50:06,342 --> 00:50:09,063
It was horrible, it was just killing his PC

1127
00:50:09,063 --> 00:50:10,003
every time we played.

1128
00:50:10,003 --> 00:50:12,804
Yeah, we're gonna, and that is exactly what we're working on.

1129
00:50:12,804 --> 00:50:13,785
So that's great feedback.

1130
00:50:13,785 --> 00:50:15,465
That's like the big thing that we're working on right now

1131
00:50:15,465 --> 00:50:16,665
is like how to get that all,

1132
00:50:16,665 --> 00:50:20,326
how to get that all performing well

1133
00:50:20,326 --> 00:50:22,567
for the potato, the toasters, for all of those.

1134
00:50:22,567 --> 00:50:24,648
So yes, and the two artists are right down here

1135
00:50:24,648 --> 00:50:25,268
if you wanna talk to them.

1136
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,331
Thank you very much.

1137
00:50:27,331 --> 00:50:28,532
You're welcome.

1138
00:50:28,532 --> 00:50:28,572
Hi.

1139
00:50:28,572 --> 00:50:31,093
Hi, thank you for your talk.

1140
00:50:31,093 --> 00:50:33,915
I'm curious to hear about how the new client

1141
00:50:33,915 --> 00:50:38,058
has impacted user player engagement with VIP

1142
00:50:38,058 --> 00:50:43,361
for specifically them accessing the news on the client,

1143
00:50:43,361 --> 00:50:46,623
the store, or the creative content

1144
00:50:46,623 --> 00:50:48,725
that's published on the client.

1145
00:50:48,725 --> 00:50:50,686
And is there any room for improvement?

1146
00:50:51,878 --> 00:50:53,959
Oh yeah, there's going to be room for improvement.

1147
00:50:53,959 --> 00:50:57,780
I think we're still figuring out, I don't know if you've seen our universe website,

1148
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:02,481
but we put up the universe website now that explains all of the regions and there's stories

1149
00:51:02,481 --> 00:51:08,982
about our champions and everything's there so we can start getting the story of RRP out

1150
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,222
there.

1151
00:51:10,222 --> 00:51:14,103
And, you know, we do surveys as well, like asking players how excited are you about the

1152
00:51:14,103 --> 00:51:16,863
lore and how much more lore do you want to see.

1153
00:51:17,814 --> 00:51:21,415
We get mixed feedback, but a lot of players do want to understand more about the world,

1154
00:51:21,415 --> 00:51:23,536
and that's one of the reasons why we do this.

1155
00:51:23,536 --> 00:51:26,116
But as far as relating it straight back to engagement,

1156
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:31,218
it's hard for me to do that right now with the client not particularly being finished or out there.

1157
00:51:31,218 --> 00:51:37,039
I think it was for us, it's more about, of course, we want engagement, but it's about immersion.

1158
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:40,560
Because before we had so many different styles and so many things going on.

1159
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,141
We didn't have factions. You didn't know where these champions were from.

1160
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:44,702
It's hard to be immersed in that.

1161
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:47,860
It's like a kind of a scattering of really cool creative stuff.

1162
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:50,422
So what we're looking for in the game

1163
00:51:50,422 --> 00:51:52,143
is having that sense of immersion,

1164
00:51:52,143 --> 00:51:55,305
having it feel like everything was thought through

1165
00:51:55,305 --> 00:51:56,606
and all the pieces fit together.

1166
00:51:56,606 --> 00:51:57,387
Got it.

1167
00:51:57,387 --> 00:51:57,787
Thank you.

1168
00:51:57,787 --> 00:51:58,227
You're welcome.

1169
00:51:58,227 --> 00:51:58,267
Hi.

1170
00:51:58,267 --> 00:51:58,307
Hi.

1171
00:52:01,276 --> 00:52:04,417
That was really amazing. I got goosebumps looking at everything.

1172
00:52:04,417 --> 00:52:05,497
So congratulations.

1173
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,558
Thank you so much.

1174
00:52:06,558 --> 00:52:07,158
Thank you.

1175
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:12,540
I was just wondering how does your team work, your UI, UX team?

1176
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:15,381
Is everyone hyper specialized in their little field?

1177
00:52:15,381 --> 00:52:20,183
Or is everyone a bit of a Swiss army knife where they can do everything

1178
00:52:20,183 --> 00:52:25,325
and do your artists do implementations or they just leave it to the engineers?

1179
00:52:25,325 --> 00:52:27,666
How does that work in a big team?

1180
00:52:27,666 --> 00:52:30,447
That's a really good question.

1181
00:52:31,122 --> 00:52:33,945
So first, on the type of people on the team, we have both.

1182
00:52:33,945 --> 00:52:35,226
We have people who are specialists,

1183
00:52:35,226 --> 00:52:37,848
and we have people that are more like a Swiss Army knife.

1184
00:52:37,848 --> 00:52:40,570
And like one of our motion artists, Andrew,

1185
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:43,072
he is like everything.

1186
00:52:43,072 --> 00:52:44,033
Like he can do everything.

1187
00:52:44,033 --> 00:52:45,494
He can do this beautiful motion work.

1188
00:52:45,494 --> 00:52:46,755
He can think of tools.

1189
00:52:46,755 --> 00:52:47,856
He's very technical.

1190
00:52:47,856 --> 00:52:50,938
He's kind of a savant, brilliant guy.

1191
00:52:50,938 --> 00:52:52,660
So he is a Swiss Army knife.

1192
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:56,583
And some of us are, we're way more on the art side, right?

1193
00:52:56,583 --> 00:52:58,584
Like myself, like way more into graphic design

1194
00:52:58,584 --> 00:53:00,246
and art and thinking about design.

1195
00:53:00,827 --> 00:53:04,068
So our team is, I think, a healthy mix.

1196
00:53:04,068 --> 00:53:06,649
We also have an artist that's really into UX, right?

1197
00:53:06,649 --> 00:53:10,230
Who loves, happily bang together his own wireframes

1198
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:12,111
and share them with the UX designers.

1199
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:13,311
So I'd say we have a mix on our team.

1200
00:53:13,311 --> 00:53:14,451
We have specialists and we have people

1201
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:15,612
that are more Swiss Army Knives.

1202
00:53:15,612 --> 00:53:18,613
And then as far as how we work together,

1203
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:20,794
is that what the other part of the question was?

1204
00:53:20,794 --> 00:53:21,774
Like, um...

1205
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:27,660
Do they specifically do UX only or do they dabble a bit in visual?

1206
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,881
No, yeah, I would say that there are some people who don't, but like I said,

1207
00:53:30,881 --> 00:53:34,041
there are some people who definitely do. So it's just kind of like, it totally depends.

1208
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:38,042
Like Jessica, one of our artists, she's an amazing illustrator, like insane.

1209
00:53:38,042 --> 00:53:41,143
Like she does splash illustration as well. She's also a visual designer.

1210
00:53:41,143 --> 00:53:45,444
So in the beginning, when you saw that really rendered take of Hextech we did

1211
00:53:45,444 --> 00:53:48,004
that looked like a machine, a lot of that was Jessica's rendering.

1212
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,082
and she can render way further than that.

1213
00:53:50,082 --> 00:53:51,563
That was actually pretty rough

1214
00:53:51,563 --> 00:53:53,484
compared to how far she can go.

1215
00:53:53,484 --> 00:53:54,685
So that's it, yeah.

1216
00:53:54,685 --> 00:53:55,826
I think we just have a mix of people.

1217
00:53:55,826 --> 00:53:57,847
We have probably like three or four people

1218
00:53:57,847 --> 00:53:58,948
that are more Swiss Army knife,

1219
00:53:58,948 --> 00:54:00,489
and then we probably have three or four people

1220
00:54:00,489 --> 00:54:02,030
that are more specialists.

1221
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,272
So in terms of if you want to expand your team,

1222
00:54:05,272 --> 00:54:08,654
what do you look for in applicants or people?

1223
00:54:08,654 --> 00:54:12,837
Do you mean for a specific discipline?

1224
00:54:12,837 --> 00:54:14,558
Because you have to think that like the LCU team

1225
00:54:14,558 --> 00:54:16,139
is kind of a cross-discipline art team.

1226
00:54:17,207 --> 00:54:22,070
So do you mean specifically for like a team like LCU or do you mean for a discipline like

1227
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:25,012
motion graphics versus visual design?

1228
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:33,056
Well I guess if say you have a UI artist who is very interested in UX and they feel like

1229
00:54:33,056 --> 00:54:38,819
should I show more visual stuff to you or should I show more design stuff or would they

1230
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:41,521
be worried that they can't code any actual UI?

1231
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:44,222
We wouldn't be worried about that.

1232
00:54:44,997 --> 00:54:46,358
whether or not you could code,

1233
00:54:46,358 --> 00:54:47,958
that would be seen as a plus.

1234
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:49,979
But I think what we usually ask applicants to do

1235
00:54:49,979 --> 00:54:52,120
is kind of pick, we talk a lot about being T-shaped

1236
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,881
at the studio, so you're deep in one thing,

1237
00:54:53,881 --> 00:54:55,501
and then you have interests,

1238
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:56,982
and you have a T-shaped mindset, right?

1239
00:54:56,982 --> 00:55:00,663
You understand multiple types of development,

1240
00:55:00,663 --> 00:55:02,944
and you have different skills.

1241
00:55:02,944 --> 00:55:06,426
So normally when somebody applies to Riot,

1242
00:55:06,426 --> 00:55:08,646
we wanna know what their deep T is,

1243
00:55:08,646 --> 00:55:11,307
and then everything else, it's, by the way, we love it.

1244
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:13,688
The more T-shaped people are, it's really fantastic,

1245
00:55:13,688 --> 00:55:13,988
because.

1246
00:55:14,315 --> 00:55:16,258
then they're gonna be able to fill in the gaps in the team.

1247
00:55:16,258 --> 00:55:18,580
Like sometimes when the UX designers were too busy,

1248
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,382
visual designer could jump in

1249
00:55:20,382 --> 00:55:21,784
and help out with the wireframes.

1250
00:55:21,784 --> 00:55:25,208
That's very useful because it unsticks the team.

1251
00:55:25,208 --> 00:55:26,009
So that's kind of how we do it.

1252
00:55:26,009 --> 00:55:27,550
I think that's.

1253
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:28,712
Yeah, that's all.

1254
00:55:28,712 --> 00:55:29,432
Thank you so much.

1255
00:55:29,432 --> 00:55:30,113
Thank you.

1256
00:55:30,113 --> 00:55:30,834
Thanks everybody.
