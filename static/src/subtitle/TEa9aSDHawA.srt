1
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:10,273
Hey guys, thanks for coming.

2
00:00:10,273 --> 00:00:13,095
My past life was as a conference organizer like Tom,

3
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:15,978
so these organized presentations are a little new to me.

4
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:17,519
Ah, but thanks so much for coming to my talk

5
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,360
on All Choice, No Consequence,

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,223
How to Efficiently Branch Your Game's Narrative.

7
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:23,704
You are probably sitting in the audience

8
00:00:23,704 --> 00:00:26,006
because you have realized, like so much of us,

9
00:00:26,006 --> 00:00:28,387
that interactive narrative is super in right now.

10
00:00:28,948 --> 00:00:31,610
We are seeing it on the top grossing charts of the iOS

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,832
store in a lot of interactive story games,

12
00:00:33,832 --> 00:00:35,894
like the game I work for, Episode Interactive,

13
00:00:35,894 --> 00:00:38,456
as well as some of Telltale's hit titles, Inkle,

14
00:00:38,456 --> 00:00:42,239
and that new, what is that little space traveler one?

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,000
I didn't put it on my slide.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,302
We're also seeing it in adventure games.

17
00:00:45,302 --> 00:00:47,324
Adventure games used to be very linear,

18
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:49,286
but we're starting to see dialogue branches happening

19
00:00:49,286 --> 00:00:51,487
where you can start to own the character a little bit more

20
00:00:51,487 --> 00:00:53,449
and customize how they respond to prompts.

21
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:55,511
Things like Broken Age and Kentucky Route Zero

22
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:56,872
are some example of those.

23
00:00:57,531 --> 00:00:59,535
And you're even seeing it in AAA titles.

24
00:00:59,535 --> 00:01:02,059
Fallout 4, Mass Effect, and Shadow of Mordor

25
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:04,163
got a lot of buzz for how much agency

26
00:01:04,163 --> 00:01:06,647
they gave their players and how much they allowed them

27
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:08,110
to customize their narratives.

28
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:11,775
But there's a giant question of, is it worth it?

29
00:01:11,775 --> 00:01:13,816
Liam is giving a talk tomorrow, I've learned.

30
00:01:13,816 --> 00:01:14,477
You should check it out.

31
00:01:14,477 --> 00:01:15,337
It's on branching narrative.

32
00:01:15,337 --> 00:01:17,258
He'll have a lot of data to back up what I'm about to say,

33
00:01:17,258 --> 00:01:18,119
so you should go see it.

34
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,220
But in general, when you think about it,

35
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,401
you're trying to write hundreds of different storylines

36
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:26,044
with thousands of different character interactions,

37
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,305
millions of different lines of dialogue,

38
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:29,726
and if you're trying to do it that way.

39
00:01:30,488 --> 00:01:31,309
you're actually wrong.

40
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:34,531
That is the wrong approach to writing interactive fiction.

41
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:36,312
It'll get you really lost in your script,

42
00:01:36,312 --> 00:01:37,734
it'll get you really muddied,

43
00:01:37,734 --> 00:01:39,735
and it'll probably get you to miss all of your budgets

44
00:01:39,735 --> 00:01:41,336
and all of your deadlines.

45
00:01:41,336 --> 00:01:44,139
So my hope is to teach you how to design your choices smartly.

46
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:47,612
So we do know, and I agree, and the data shows,

47
00:01:47,612 --> 00:01:50,213
that having choice matters in your game.

48
00:01:50,213 --> 00:01:52,673
It improves your retention, it makes your game more fun,

49
00:01:52,673 --> 00:01:54,714
and it makes your players happier.

50
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,094
Those choices, most importantly,

51
00:01:56,094 --> 00:01:58,735
have to feel impactful to the players.

52
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:00,736
They have to feel like they make a difference.

53
00:02:00,736 --> 00:02:03,036
The data shows that having choices

54
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:06,417
that are actually impactful to your storyline,

55
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,378
not really a big deal, and tends to be a waste

56
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,658
of really valuable time and money

57
00:02:09,658 --> 00:02:11,059
when your game is being developed.

58
00:02:11,059 --> 00:02:12,319
So I'm hoping to help you design

59
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,660
your choices a little more smartly.

60
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:16,056
So why am I standing here?

61
00:02:16,056 --> 00:02:16,556
Who am I?

62
00:02:16,556 --> 00:02:19,458
Why does GDC want me giving this talk?

63
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,539
So I'm Cass Phillips.

64
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:23,061
I'm a creative manager at Episode Interactive.

65
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:26,925
That is a platform for mobile interactive animated stories.

66
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:29,967
We empower our players to create these stories.

67
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:32,389
So we have over 13,000 stories live on our app.

68
00:02:32,389 --> 00:02:35,192
We have over 3 and 1 half million weekly active users.

69
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:37,654
Over 1.5 billion episodes have been played.

70
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:40,056
And we are regularly a top grossing iOS app.

71
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:43,298
Mostly what this means is that we have a lot of data

72
00:02:43,298 --> 00:02:45,860
on what branching is, on what choices work,

73
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,241
on what choices don't, on how to do that retention.

74
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:50,082
And we've made a lot of stories internally,

75
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:51,223
so I'm gonna hope to share with you guys

76
00:02:51,223 --> 00:02:53,545
some tips and tricks we've learned along the way.

77
00:02:54,643 --> 00:02:57,104
For example, here is a choice example.

78
00:02:57,104 --> 00:02:59,765
I have a really long narrative, it won't change that much,

79
00:02:59,765 --> 00:03:01,025
but I have set some information in it

80
00:03:01,025 --> 00:03:02,966
that you may or may not be interested in.

81
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:04,126
So I'm presenting with you a choice

82
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:05,487
on how you'd like to see the information

83
00:03:05,487 --> 00:03:07,307
and what is most important to you.

84
00:03:07,307 --> 00:03:08,588
It won't drastically change your story,

85
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:11,248
but it'll change how the presentation flows a little bit.

86
00:03:11,248 --> 00:03:12,209
So a quick show of hands,

87
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,269
you can learn more about episode in our data,

88
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:17,010
you can learn more about how I execute branches,

89
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,651
or you can have me avoid engaging with you.

90
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:19,231
Show of hands,

91
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:21,171
who is most interested in episode in our data?

92
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:24,208
Just a few, great.

93
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,491
Who is most interested in how to execute on these branches?

94
00:03:26,491 --> 00:03:27,512
I've done more, I guess.

95
00:03:27,512 --> 00:03:29,374
Good, I didn't like the data anyway.

96
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:30,796
Who wants me to stop asking you questions?

97
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:32,018
Great, I'm gonna keep asking questions.

98
00:03:32,018 --> 00:03:34,841
But I don't have that many, don't worry.

99
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,603
So I'm gonna skip these slides.

100
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:40,416
Okay, we'll come back to them if there's time.

101
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,276
You can ask questions.

102
00:03:41,276 --> 00:03:47,301
So I break branching our stories into four very distinct parts that barely ever cross.

103
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:52,966
There are the choices, there is the dialogue, there is the story, and there are the branches.

104
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:56,529
I do separate branches and branches from just choices.

105
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,950
Quick show of hands, another classic choice example.

106
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,271
I'm the NPC, I'm asking you, the player character,

107
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:03,071
your opinion.

108
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:04,891
It's not going to change how I respond,

109
00:04:04,891 --> 00:04:07,232
but it allows you to be friends or enemies with me.

110
00:04:07,232 --> 00:04:11,513
One for choices, two for dialogue, three for story,

111
00:04:11,513 --> 00:04:12,353
four for branches.

112
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,193
What is most important to the success

113
00:04:14,193 --> 00:04:15,934
of your interactive fiction game?

114
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:16,594
Show of hands.

115
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:19,554
One for choice, two for dialogue, three for a story,

116
00:04:19,554 --> 00:04:20,675
four for branches.

117
00:04:21,976 --> 00:04:25,338
There's a pretty good mix, so I'm actually kind of surprised

118
00:04:25,338 --> 00:04:26,379
there's a pretty good mix,

119
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:27,920
because I think there's a right answer,

120
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,240
and I think the right answer is story.

121
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,861
So any of you who said three,

122
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:32,102
that's what I think the right answer is.

123
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:35,244
That's what our data suggests, yes, that I'll show later.

124
00:04:35,244 --> 00:04:37,766
So always start with your story.

125
00:04:37,766 --> 00:04:39,627
That is the first step to creating

126
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:42,449
the narrative of your game.

127
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,469
It is the most important part.

128
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:45,631
It will define how players are reacting.

129
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:48,933
This is not a story talk, so I have one quick slide on it.

130
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:50,934
Go to some great story talks given by somebody else.

131
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:57,991
Most importantly, your story needs to be impactful, it needs to be meaningful, it needs to have a great theme.

132
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:01,972
This is not a time to be distracting yourself with branches and choices.

133
00:05:01,972 --> 00:05:04,193
They will just muddy your process.

134
00:05:04,193 --> 00:05:09,514
Every time that we start discussing branches in our outline phase or our story room, we get lost,

135
00:05:09,514 --> 00:05:13,316
we lose where our act breaks are, and our beats start to get really, really muddied.

136
00:05:13,816 --> 00:05:17,419
This is a phase to just create a really great outline.

137
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:19,441
An outline should be read by strangers

138
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:21,603
and they feel engaged, they feel interested,

139
00:05:21,603 --> 00:05:24,545
they can follow it, but they may still have a few questions,

140
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:26,787
which is a great place for your outline to be in

141
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:28,989
when you move to branches,

142
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:30,110
which are definitely the most fun.

143
00:05:31,148 --> 00:05:33,369
So something to keep in mind with branches,

144
00:05:33,369 --> 00:05:36,251
a lot of data, Liam will show you some of this tomorrow,

145
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:38,552
shows that your players are not replaying your game

146
00:05:38,552 --> 00:05:39,252
that often.

147
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:41,453
You should not design for replays.

148
00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:44,734
You should design for their very first experience to be fun.

149
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:47,976
We've also noticed in our data on that episode

150
00:05:47,976 --> 00:05:51,837
that branching doesn't actually affect replayability

151
00:05:51,837 --> 00:05:52,458
all that much.

152
00:05:53,258 --> 00:05:55,460
I don't have specific numbers, but here's a nice little graph.

153
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,243
If we take the pink one, that's a story called The Ember Effect,

154
00:05:58,243 --> 00:06:00,626
that is about our average replayability.

155
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,229
The Ember Effect has no branches at all.

156
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:05,611
Has some little tiny choices.

157
00:06:05,611 --> 00:06:07,013
We compare it to Finding Mr. Right.

158
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:10,076
Finding Mr. Right is a story we produced that is 15 episodes long.

159
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:12,439
It's about 150 minutes of gameplay.

160
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,500
Very easy to replay.

161
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,281
It has four major storylines running through it

162
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:18,701
that you can interact with.

163
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:19,921
It has 12 different endings.

164
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,582
It has hundreds, if not thousands of choices in it.

165
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,282
We advertise all of this up front,

166
00:06:24,282 --> 00:06:27,123
and it is replayed slightly above average.

167
00:06:27,123 --> 00:06:29,403
Take a great story.

168
00:06:29,403 --> 00:06:31,023
Super Secret Cedar Hill is an example of that.

169
00:06:31,023 --> 00:06:33,084
A lot of our recent originals are examples

170
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:34,424
where we brought it into a story room,

171
00:06:34,424 --> 00:06:36,544
we really workshopped the story.

172
00:06:36,544 --> 00:06:38,165
It has no branching whatsoever,

173
00:06:38,165 --> 00:06:40,645
and it's getting a little above massive branching.

174
00:06:41,245 --> 00:06:44,068
If you look at Tangled Love, that is our most replayed story,

175
00:06:44,068 --> 00:06:47,111
it also has no branching until the very end,

176
00:06:47,111 --> 00:06:50,113
where a single choice gives you four different endings.

177
00:06:50,113 --> 00:06:52,435
What it does do really well is a number of small choices

178
00:06:52,435 --> 00:06:54,357
that are all about relationship building

179
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:56,179
and just about feeling like I am responding

180
00:06:56,179 --> 00:06:56,979
to the characters around me,

181
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:59,682
and they are reacting in very small ways to me.

182
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:00,823
And we think that that is leading

183
00:07:00,823 --> 00:07:02,084
to a lot of its replayability.

184
00:07:03,654 --> 00:07:06,437
So on that note, branches, still really fun, still really cool.

185
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:08,098
We do put them in our game.

186
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:10,541
First of all, what is a major branch,

187
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,863
just so we know the difference between a good branch

188
00:07:12,863 --> 00:07:14,164
and a bad branch?

189
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:15,986
So a major branch is something that's probably

190
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:18,548
a change in many scenes or characters

191
00:07:18,548 --> 00:07:20,110
due to the choice that those players made.

192
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,353
Usually it's going to be a unique way to reach the same goal.

193
00:07:23,353 --> 00:07:25,535
Again, you have those goals on your outline, those beats through it.

194
00:07:25,535 --> 00:07:28,517
It's going to be different ways that you get to them.

195
00:07:28,517 --> 00:07:32,401
It's probably strong enough that it is memorable and you can reference it periodically to the story

196
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:34,403
and the player is not left scratching their head like,

197
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:35,964
when did I make that choice? What is that about?

198
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:39,068
And as a reminder, it is not a completely disconnected storyline.

199
00:07:39,068 --> 00:07:42,211
You always want to bring these back to your major story.

200
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,834
Some examples out in the industry so you can stay aware of it,

201
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:48,939
in Demi Lovato, which was the game I worked on and that I creatively led,

202
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:50,400
who you date is a pre-major branch.

203
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,923
It will show you different scenes, your dates will be different,

204
00:07:52,923 --> 00:07:54,685
how that character reacts to you will change,

205
00:07:54,685 --> 00:07:56,447
but the main story is going to be the same.

206
00:07:57,168 --> 00:07:59,449
Who you save in episode two of The Walking Dead

207
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:01,429
is a great example of this.

208
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:03,610
It'll change all of your character interactions

209
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,191
with that character in the next scenes,

210
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:07,432
but in the end, doesn't change the story.

211
00:08:07,432 --> 00:08:09,032
And then in Ingalls Sorcery, for example,

212
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:10,333
where you actually go on the map

213
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,274
will change the scenes that you see,

214
00:08:13,274 --> 00:08:15,234
but the basic goals will stay the same.

215
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:16,655
So how do you find branches?

216
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:17,975
That's obviously what you're here for.

217
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:19,416
How can you find them really, really quickly?

218
00:08:22,657 --> 00:08:24,997
One of the major ones that we look at is our story room disagreements.

219
00:08:24,997 --> 00:08:28,198
If you guys don't have story rooms, I suggest you get them,

220
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:30,219
but if you still aren't going to have story rooms,

221
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:33,360
it's when you're ever discussing the outline with someone

222
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,861
and there's a pretty big disagreement about how something goes.

223
00:08:35,861 --> 00:08:39,542
What happens with us is the story leader, the writer, takes point,

224
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:41,283
they make a decision and they move on,

225
00:08:41,283 --> 00:08:42,663
because now is not the time for branches,

226
00:08:42,663 --> 00:08:45,725
but they put a little note in the margin, add a branch here.

227
00:08:46,477 --> 00:08:50,119
An example of this is when we were writing our Mean Girls story with Paramount, the love

228
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:50,859
interest Micah.

229
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:53,280
We had a disagreement in the story room whether you should kiss him or not.

230
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,682
If you kiss him too early, it felt like the chase went away, I already won the dating

231
00:08:57,682 --> 00:08:59,363
game, I don't need to pursue.

232
00:08:59,363 --> 00:09:03,345
But also if I kiss him, it ups the stakes of the relationship, it makes it more serious.

233
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:07,207
We moved forward with not kissing him, but we went back later, added a kiss, changed

234
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:10,909
a number of scenes after that, but like any rom-com, you end up having some big fight

235
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:12,730
over some big disagreement and a kiss is irrelevant.

236
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:16,220
So look for story room disagreements.

237
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,863
Two, again, that outline has key beats on it.

238
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:21,625
They're probably each giving you a piece of information,

239
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,768
and they're progressing the story in an interesting way, I hope.

240
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:25,989
See if you can reorder those.

241
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:29,352
There was a great example of this in Telltale's The Wolf Among Us,

242
00:09:29,352 --> 00:09:32,635
where you could choose to go to Prince Charming's house first,

243
00:09:32,635 --> 00:09:34,136
or Mr. Toad's house first.

244
00:09:34,136 --> 00:09:36,719
They set up very clear consequences right up front,

245
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,280
which is an important thing I'll touch on later.

246
00:09:39,381 --> 00:09:41,304
to say that if you went to one of these places first,

247
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:43,867
you would miss out on something happening at the other one.

248
00:09:43,867 --> 00:09:44,948
But in the end, you'll go to both,

249
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:47,772
you'll get the same key story informations,

250
00:09:47,772 --> 00:09:49,053
but you'll feel like you've changed

251
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:51,416
one of those characters' lives just a little bit.

252
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,258
So your art line is maintained,

253
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:54,260
but you have a nice little branch

254
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,821
where the players felt like they could customize it.

255
00:09:57,258 --> 00:10:08,343
And finally, looking at that outline, look at each major goal that you've set up in the outline and figure out how to answer the how question that is between goal A and goal B, or conflict A and conflict B.

256
00:10:08,343 --> 00:10:17,448
That's why you keep that outline a little bit loose. An example of this in one of our stories on episode My Brother's Best Friend, you must have a fight with your parents, it is part of the story.

257
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:21,370
It also must be about your eating disorder, which it is a story about an eating disorder.

258
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,651
how you have that fight and what triggers it

259
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:26,892
is up to the players and the choices that they make.

260
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:28,552
So we've seeded it with a couple of choices.

261
00:10:28,552 --> 00:10:30,193
We have a few big branches on exactly

262
00:10:30,193 --> 00:10:31,493
what triggers this fight,

263
00:10:31,493 --> 00:10:33,014
but the fight happens no matter what.

264
00:10:33,014 --> 00:10:36,075
So this is a great moment where we could just kind of

265
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:38,435
adjust the how to create more player agency.

266
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,972
We have found that generally getting one branch in

267
00:10:42,972 --> 00:10:45,074
as soon as possible is important.

268
00:10:45,074 --> 00:10:47,897
We have one within 12 lines of dialogue in Demi Lovato

269
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,399
because this shows your players that their choices

270
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,001
are going to matter with everything they do.

271
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:54,904
It's going to drastically change the story

272
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,005
even if it doesn't.

273
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:57,406
But it plants that seed in their head.

274
00:10:58,187 --> 00:10:59,748
We then put a major branch in,

275
00:10:59,748 --> 00:11:01,849
roughly every 20 to 30 minutes of gameplay.

276
00:11:01,849 --> 00:11:04,450
That seems to be about industry norm

277
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,970
when I look at Mass Effect and Telltale Games.

278
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,351
I don't have great data to tell you that that's right,

279
00:11:09,351 --> 00:11:10,232
but it kind of feels good.

280
00:11:10,232 --> 00:11:12,633
For us, that's about every two to three episodes,

281
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:14,953
and in the Telltale Games, if you play it,

282
00:11:14,953 --> 00:11:16,694
you'll notice there's one to two per episode.

283
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:20,848
As a reminder, this is the branch stage.

284
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,990
It is not the choice stage, which, in my mind,

285
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,992
are very distinct things.

286
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:28,295
Branches are the things that you must outline before you write them.

287
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:30,478
Do not get bogged down in your choices at this moment.

288
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:33,341
It's, again, just going to get you lost in the weeds.

289
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:34,822
You don't even have your dialogue yet.

290
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:37,184
You're not positive how a scene is going to flow.

291
00:11:37,184 --> 00:11:38,266
Don't worry about choices right now.

292
00:11:38,266 --> 00:11:41,469
You've just got an outline, and you've got some great branches.

293
00:11:42,072 --> 00:11:44,178
So you outline those branches, you make sure they work,

294
00:11:44,178 --> 00:11:45,201
they stick to your core story,

295
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:46,284
you get your writer back on it,

296
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:48,130
and you write a great script,

297
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,955
because now you're ready for some scripts.

298
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:53,125
Again, it's not a story talk, it's a branching talk,

299
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:53,965
so just one slide.

300
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:56,466
Some things to keep in mind when you're doing dialogue

301
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,786
in games, make sure you have very unique character voices.

302
00:11:58,786 --> 00:12:01,127
I should be able to read a line of dialogue

303
00:12:01,127 --> 00:12:02,568
and know exactly who said it.

304
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:05,088
Make sure each line of dialogue has a very succinct

305
00:12:05,088 --> 00:12:07,769
and clear reason to be there, especially on mobile,

306
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,790
attention spans are very short.

307
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,690
Make sure you have set up very clear consequences

308
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,251
and goals with each line of dialogue.

309
00:12:13,251 --> 00:12:14,751
I've noticed in gaming that sometimes we need

310
00:12:14,751 --> 00:12:16,192
to be a little bit more on the nose

311
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:18,112
when we're trying to get our players to read.

312
00:12:18,632 --> 00:12:20,356
And make sure you're obviously discussing regularly

313
00:12:20,356 --> 00:12:21,578
with your design team.

314
00:12:21,578 --> 00:12:24,122
How you write a script for a AAA first-person shooter

315
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:25,745
is gonna be very different than how you write a script

316
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,346
for an adventure game.

317
00:12:27,735 --> 00:12:29,597
So finally the fun part, choices.

318
00:12:29,597 --> 00:12:31,599
It's my favorite.

319
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:32,720
A quick bit of data here.

320
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,881
This is one of our stories that was fine,

321
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:36,503
so we were willing to kind of rip it apart

322
00:12:36,503 --> 00:12:38,184
and play with it.

323
00:12:38,184 --> 00:12:40,606
We tested a version for very first time players

324
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:42,828
that had no choices in it whatsoever.

325
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:44,409
Big surprise, retention was down.

326
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:47,092
This is a retention chart for the story.

327
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:48,132
So no choices, bad.

328
00:12:49,036 --> 00:12:51,760
The other two lines, however, are us putting in 10 choices

329
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,083
that we worked kind of hard on and 20 choices

330
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,505
that we did in the same amount of time.

331
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:57,808
So just kind of guiding choices wherever we could see them

332
00:12:57,808 --> 00:12:58,970
and make them fit.

333
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,892
You'll notice immediately the retention

334
00:13:00,892 --> 00:13:02,134
doesn't really change.

335
00:13:02,134 --> 00:13:03,316
I don't have a sweet spot for you

336
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,519
for exactly how many choices you need.

337
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,504
We found that about a choice per page of dialogue,

338
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:11,406
or about a choice per minute to minute and a half

339
00:13:11,406 --> 00:13:15,451
of interactivity seems to feel fun in play tests.

340
00:13:15,451 --> 00:13:18,935
But the main takeaway here is to make a few great choices,

341
00:13:18,935 --> 00:13:20,297
not a hundred mediocre ones.

342
00:13:22,087 --> 00:13:24,608
So where can you find those choices really, really quickly

343
00:13:24,608 --> 00:13:26,109
so you get that game out the door?

344
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:28,530
Number one for me, a really huge cheat.

345
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:30,332
I do a Control F through my entire script

346
00:13:30,332 --> 00:13:31,232
for the question mark.

347
00:13:31,232 --> 00:13:33,273
Every question mark in your script

348
00:13:33,273 --> 00:13:34,594
is probably an NPC character

349
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:36,535
asking your character a question.

350
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:37,456
That is a choice.

351
00:13:37,456 --> 00:13:40,798
I then look at the line of dialogue I've given that

352
00:13:40,798 --> 00:13:42,699
and I think of two to three other great lines of dialogue

353
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:43,680
that could be there instead.

354
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,280
Two really easy ones.

355
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,321
Any place that you can change artwork,

356
00:13:48,321 --> 00:13:50,061
allow your players to design that artwork.

357
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:52,342
We have them design outfits in our game.

358
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:53,943
We have them design avatar creators.

359
00:13:53,943 --> 00:13:56,924
We even have them design boyfriends, girlfriends,

360
00:13:56,924 --> 00:13:58,044
best friends.

361
00:13:58,044 --> 00:13:59,384
We're having them start designing cars

362
00:13:59,384 --> 00:14:00,945
they want to be driving in the background.

363
00:14:00,945 --> 00:14:03,106
Anything that just allows them to change art,

364
00:14:03,106 --> 00:14:04,126
but not affect your story.

365
00:14:05,793 --> 00:14:08,315
And three, a little not predictably,

366
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:09,876
unavoidable consequences.

367
00:14:09,876 --> 00:14:12,698
Unavoidable consequences tend to not be fun.

368
00:14:12,698 --> 00:14:14,900
It's where the game seems to be punishing you

369
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,402
for maybe not being in control of a situation,

370
00:14:17,402 --> 00:14:20,104
but you have a story, so negative things have to happen.

371
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:21,745
We found that burying this in choices

372
00:14:21,745 --> 00:14:23,346
is a great kind of response to it.

373
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:28,938
For example, in the Demi game there's a moment where your sister has to get angry at you on television.

374
00:14:28,938 --> 00:14:34,282
The point of the game is to balance fame and family and love and health.

375
00:14:34,282 --> 00:14:38,205
So you were so focused on fame for so long that your family fell to the wayside.

376
00:14:38,205 --> 00:14:41,528
Obviously players were upset when they got to this because they're like,

377
00:14:41,528 --> 00:14:43,530
yo, I never had a chance to actually interact with my sister,

378
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,732
so it's not really fair that she got mad at me. You guys didn't make that an option.

379
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,814
So we went through and we seeded a bunch of scenes that already existed

380
00:14:50,814 --> 00:14:54,855
with small questions and choices that allowed you to choose your family over that moment

381
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:58,176
and then wrote a couple very small interactions that were pretty minimal

382
00:14:58,176 --> 00:15:00,217
just to give you those choices.

383
00:15:00,217 --> 00:15:01,937
If you ever didn't choose family in that moment,

384
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:04,958
your sister could now reference it when she was on the television show.

385
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,099
And if you always chose family, now your friends around you could back you up

386
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:09,779
and we had some interesting character conflict.

387
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:13,220
Suddenly the player distaste of the scene pretty much went away.

388
00:15:14,828 --> 00:15:18,671
But on that note, it isn't important that any choice you add feels like it matters.

389
00:15:18,671 --> 00:15:21,974
So here's some really quick ways to test and make sure your choice feels meaningful.

390
00:15:21,974 --> 00:15:24,776
First of all, make sure you're keeping track of character scores.

391
00:15:24,776 --> 00:15:26,757
Always add a positive any time you have a negative.

392
00:15:26,757 --> 00:15:30,360
And then if you're going to reference that score later, which I suggest you do,

393
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,221
just change a single line of dialogue.

394
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:34,523
So usually, I think Ingle's actually really great with this,

395
00:15:34,523 --> 00:15:37,045
you'll notice that when they start a new conversation with a character,

396
00:15:37,045 --> 00:15:39,206
or if it's been a while since you interacted with them,

397
00:15:39,206 --> 00:15:40,947
you'll notice that they'll have a line of dialogue like...

398
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:45,780
He turns to you with a grimace and sneers as he says.

399
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,980
And then they'll have a separate one that's like,

400
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,881
he looks at you grinning and replies.

401
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:53,162
And all the rest of it is gonna be identical,

402
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:55,023
but you're now gonna read a new tone into it

403
00:15:55,023 --> 00:15:56,543
and it's gonna feel like he's responding

404
00:15:56,543 --> 00:15:57,443
to the choices you've made.

405
00:15:57,443 --> 00:16:00,344
Always react immediately.

406
00:16:00,344 --> 00:16:03,665
I apparently didn't turn my calendar notifications off.

407
00:16:04,904 --> 00:16:08,186
that's super professional. Always react to it immediately. So

408
00:16:08,186 --> 00:16:11,829
essentially, telltale does the so and so will remember this. I

409
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:14,291
like to be a little more direct, have a player, another NPC

410
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,133
immediately react to the choice with something very unique to

411
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:20,115
the choice, and then move on. Seriously, like one to three

412
00:16:20,115 --> 00:16:21,216
lines, totally fine.

413
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:25,064
Make sure again you set up those consequences up front.

414
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:27,267
A choice is much more interesting if when I'm looking at it,

415
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:29,510
I feel like both of those things are different

416
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,332
and both of those things I will gain something

417
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:32,093
and lose something.

418
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:34,576
Examples of this are if you can create any moment

419
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,218
where someone has split allegiances,

420
00:16:36,218 --> 00:16:38,701
if there are multiple events that you could be attending,

421
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:40,683
or if you have conflicting goals at that moment.

422
00:16:41,988 --> 00:16:44,890
And finally, make sure all of your options have very equal weight.

423
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,412
One is not more or less interesting than another.

424
00:16:47,412 --> 00:16:49,994
Examples, do not use yes, no, and maybe.

425
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:53,918
If your choice says yes, no, and maybe, it's a terrible choice.

426
00:16:53,918 --> 00:16:55,499
It usually should have three options.

427
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:59,062
If you only have two, it probably means you had a great line of dialogue there,

428
00:16:59,062 --> 00:17:01,524
you thought of a kind of half-assed one, and then you moved on.

429
00:17:01,524 --> 00:17:03,726
Force yourself to think of a couple of options,

430
00:17:03,726 --> 00:17:05,707
and if you can't, it's probably not a good choice.

431
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:08,589
I also personally like to avoid right and wrong.

432
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,411
Our players, at least on episode,

433
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:12,052
don't seem to enjoy when they are wrong.

434
00:17:12,052 --> 00:17:14,493
They feel like the game made them wrong.

435
00:17:14,493 --> 00:17:15,234
That's up to you.

436
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,174
Feel out your players.

437
00:17:16,174 --> 00:17:18,156
But I like to just try to make them all fun.

438
00:17:18,156 --> 00:17:21,418
So here's a really common choice we see in our game.

439
00:17:21,418 --> 00:17:24,040
Your crush is talking with your revengeful ex-boyfriend.

440
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,140
Do you want to eavesdrop?

441
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,281
Show of hands, who wants to eavesdrop?

442
00:17:26,281 --> 00:17:27,222
Who does not want to eavesdrop?

443
00:17:31,752 --> 00:17:33,773
It's roughly our breakdown, about 85% of people pick yes.

444
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:37,955
We think it's because eavesdropping feels like it could be bad,

445
00:17:37,955 --> 00:17:39,696
that's why people think it's a good choice,

446
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:41,176
but really you just want information

447
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:43,177
and you want to move the game forward.

448
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:44,878
So we've changed it up here,

449
00:17:44,878 --> 00:17:46,799
we've given the options equal weight.

450
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,660
You could text your ex asking for details,

451
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,961
butt into the conversation or cause a scene down the hall.

452
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:54,302
Quick show of hands, who texts their ex?

453
00:17:54,302 --> 00:17:57,623
And if they miss any, this isn't a great choice.

454
00:17:57,623 --> 00:17:59,804
Who butts into the conversation

455
00:17:59,804 --> 00:18:01,245
and who causes a scene down the hall?

456
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:03,542
Okay, it's a little better though.

457
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:05,323
I won't make you pick on this one.

458
00:18:05,323 --> 00:18:07,445
You can also establish clear consequences up front.

459
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:08,786
This is a little on the nose,

460
00:18:08,786 --> 00:18:11,287
but your crush is talking to your revengeful ex-boyfriend,

461
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:12,728
but your class is about to start.

462
00:18:12,728 --> 00:18:15,150
If you relate to English once more, she'll flunk you.

463
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:15,770
What do you do?

464
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,412
Example that I've set up clear consequences.

465
00:18:18,412 --> 00:18:19,753
These choices each have a problem.

466
00:18:20,554 --> 00:18:21,574
Oh my gosh, I'm gonna run out of time.

467
00:18:21,574 --> 00:18:25,416
Three quick bad choices that you want to avoid.

468
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,336
False choices.

469
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:28,877
These are choices where I make a choice

470
00:18:28,877 --> 00:18:30,538
and my character immediately negates it.

471
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:31,899
The world can negate it.

472
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:33,360
It can put consequences on you

473
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,821
that make your choice unable to be executed on.

474
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:38,582
But if I say, I want to keep the journal,

475
00:18:38,582 --> 00:18:40,523
or I want to return the journal to someone,

476
00:18:40,523 --> 00:18:42,684
and then my character starts reading it

477
00:18:42,684 --> 00:18:45,205
and is like, ooh, this is really juicy, I'm gonna keep it.

478
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:47,926
Obviously a bad choice.

479
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:49,287
Character must reflect player.

480
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:51,642
Misleading choices.

481
00:18:51,642 --> 00:18:53,503
I have a really bad habit of these.

482
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:56,404
In that Demi moment when your sister called,

483
00:18:56,404 --> 00:18:58,104
one of our options to respond to her with was,

484
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:58,925
I deserve this.

485
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:00,785
Our players thought it meant,

486
00:19:00,785 --> 00:19:02,746
I deserve you getting angry at me and I'm sorry.

487
00:19:02,746 --> 00:19:04,847
But when they selected it, the character said,

488
00:19:04,847 --> 00:19:08,268
I deserve my fame and you need to get out of my face.

489
00:19:08,268 --> 00:19:11,069
Obviously that led to some player discomfort

490
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:12,430
and unhappiness and we had to go in

491
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,351
and make that choice a little more clear.

492
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:16,331
So just have outside people reading your choices

493
00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:18,132
and make sure they're very understandable.

494
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:20,246
And finally, vague choices.

495
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:21,627
I haven't gotten too far in Fallout 4,

496
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:22,867
but I've heard that every now and then

497
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:23,948
they have a problem with this.

498
00:19:23,948 --> 00:19:25,388
These are choices where you're actually

499
00:19:25,388 --> 00:19:26,369
not sure what it means.

500
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:29,490
You read it and it says something like disagree.

501
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,651
And you're like, disagree with the person,

502
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:33,872
the idea, be angry, be not angry.

503
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:35,773
I'm not sure what is gonna happen if I tap this,

504
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:36,454
so I'm not gonna tap it.

505
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:38,474
So again, make sure you're kinda on the nose

506
00:19:38,474 --> 00:19:40,635
with your options, make it very clear to your players

507
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:41,516
what they're getting into.

508
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,120
So, my key takeaways.

509
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,561
30 minutes to talk,

510
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:47,821
who knows what you actually took from it.

511
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:48,801
If you take nothing else,

512
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:50,561
here are the five things I hope you keep in mind.

513
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:52,582
Do not add branches to your story

514
00:19:52,582 --> 00:19:54,282
until it is a great story.

515
00:19:54,282 --> 00:19:57,523
Do not add choices until you have a great script.

516
00:19:57,523 --> 00:20:00,323
Every choice should have a very clear meaning,

517
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:02,984
very clear goals, and very clear consequences.

518
00:20:02,984 --> 00:20:04,864
Make sure you've written immediate reactions

519
00:20:04,864 --> 00:20:07,425
and never negate a player's agency.

520
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,963
I don't really have time for questions, but if people line up or show me if they want

521
00:20:11,963 --> 00:20:14,845
questions I can always go to that writer follow-up reader room thing that's down the hall.

522
00:20:14,845 --> 00:20:18,027
We are hiring for people that love interactive fiction, so there's our hire link if you want.

523
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:18,848
You can also email me.

524
00:20:18,848 --> 00:20:20,049
There's my email address.

525
00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:22,370
Thank you for listening to me talk for 30 minutes.

526
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,071
I have more minutes.

527
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:24,171
Oh, I have more minutes.

528
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:24,672
I didn't know.

529
00:20:24,672 --> 00:20:25,092
I thought it was a...

530
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:25,432
I thought it was a...

531
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,293
I thought it was a...

532
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:26,693
I thought it was a...

533
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:28,554
I thought it was a...

534
00:20:28,554 --> 00:20:29,395
I thought it was a...

535
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:29,935
I thought it was a...

536
00:20:29,935 --> 00:20:30,376
I thought it was a...

537
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:30,696
I thought it was a...

538
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:33,072
Oh, that's great.

539
00:20:33,072 --> 00:20:34,573
My thing told me it took 30 minutes.

540
00:20:34,573 --> 00:20:35,673
It must have been running.

541
00:20:35,673 --> 00:20:37,393
Well, I kind of race through stuff.

542
00:20:37,393 --> 00:20:39,454
So if anyone has questions, I can talk.

543
00:20:39,454 --> 00:20:41,735
You can get those mics here and there.

544
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:44,776
As a quick reminder, please fill out the little survey

545
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,216
they send you.

546
00:20:46,216 --> 00:20:47,897
I really want to know how I do.

547
00:20:47,897 --> 00:20:48,617
Two mics.

548
00:20:49,105 --> 00:20:51,886
grab a mic, I can talk about our process, I can dive deeper on

549
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:54,026
questions. Hey, how's it going? You skipped over a bunch of data

550
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:56,467
slides? I did skip over a bunch of data slides. Oh no, I

551
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:59,728
actually ended up working them in. Okay. Uh, so you saw them.

552
00:20:59,728 --> 00:21:03,849
Essentially we see that, uh, no choice is bad, tons of choice is

553
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:08,670
good, tons of choice is not also good, uh, there's a sweet step

554
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,210
in there. And that people tend to not replay your game, Liam

555
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,171
will have more data on that, but what actually makes them replay

556
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:15,772
the most is a great story. Thank you.

557
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:17,910
Hi.

558
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,310
Yeah.

559
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:23,636
So you suggest that you should make a great story first,

560
00:21:23,636 --> 00:21:25,638
then find branches for it.

561
00:21:25,638 --> 00:21:28,121
Does this risk having some scenario where the player

562
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,762
thinks, oh, there's one correct story,

563
00:21:29,762 --> 00:21:32,926
and then a bunch of branches that lead to wrong endings,

564
00:21:32,926 --> 00:21:35,768
and they're somehow less valid than the one true story?

565
00:21:35,768 --> 00:21:37,470
And how would you get around that?

566
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,793
Sure, we actually had a problem with that in one of our stories,

567
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:42,616
specifically when we added premium choices,

568
00:21:42,616 --> 00:21:45,660
choices where players could pay to get kind of a cool side story.

569
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,823
It made them feel like that was the right story.

570
00:21:48,823 --> 00:21:50,826
Generally, how we've worked around it is

571
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:54,890
we actually make sure we do follow that kind of diamond structure,

572
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,273
so that if they go online and they look things up,

573
00:21:57,273 --> 00:21:58,615
it feels like it's...

574
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:00,856
they're all seeing roughly the same experience.

575
00:22:00,856 --> 00:22:02,497
We also do a lot of play testing in-house,

576
00:22:02,497 --> 00:22:03,958
and we actually will ask our players

577
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,578
to pick different choices at times,

578
00:22:05,578 --> 00:22:06,879
so especially internally, we'll be like,

579
00:22:06,879 --> 00:22:10,181
hey, you go play choosing A, B, A, A, B,

580
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:13,783
and then tell us how you feel about the story.

581
00:22:13,783 --> 00:22:14,923
It is a lot of gut checks.

582
00:22:15,324 --> 00:22:18,125
We generally haven't though, aside from when we make paid options,

583
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:20,327
we haven't generally encountered that issue.

584
00:22:20,327 --> 00:22:23,169
I think it's because we do it before we move into scripting,

585
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:26,651
so it's still a little flexible enough that if we like a branch more,

586
00:22:26,651 --> 00:22:29,073
we're still mushy enough with our story to be like,

587
00:22:29,073 --> 00:22:33,696
well that one's so good, how do we make that one better?

588
00:22:33,696 --> 00:22:36,257
So we do it a little early enough that we can still futz with it.

589
00:22:36,257 --> 00:22:37,998
That kind of helps.

590
00:22:37,998 --> 00:22:40,120
Any other questions?

591
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,221
You had a hand up, you should have.

592
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,244
I totally can. That's a totally valid question.

593
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:49,765
Question.

594
00:22:49,765 --> 00:22:54,991
Hello. What's the best way to prevent FOMO?

595
00:23:02,254 --> 00:23:03,295
for your players?

596
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:05,578
Man, that's a good question.

597
00:23:05,578 --> 00:23:07,840
We have a lot of community engagement.

598
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,543
I found that Instagram has been a really great tool for us

599
00:23:10,543 --> 00:23:13,346
to help our players prevent FOMO.

600
00:23:13,346 --> 00:23:14,768
We'll also, in our account, we'll

601
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,229
like put up little secret endings

602
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,111
and be like, did you know how to get to this?

603
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:19,873
Then if they didn't get to it, they want to,

604
00:23:19,873 --> 00:23:21,134
but also they get to see it.

605
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,551
I haven't noticed it being a, we do make replaying an option,

606
00:23:26,551 --> 00:23:28,871
so we do, with some of our especially branchy stories,

607
00:23:28,871 --> 00:23:30,972
like Demi gets a lot of replays,

608
00:23:30,972 --> 00:23:34,392
I think also because she has a lot of fans.

609
00:23:34,392 --> 00:23:36,193
Yeah, that's kind of, I think really

610
00:23:36,193 --> 00:23:38,053
your social media community is one of your best options

611
00:23:38,053 --> 00:23:39,213
to prevent a little bit of FOMO.

612
00:23:39,213 --> 00:23:41,454
But I also don't mind if there's a little bit of FOMO

613
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:43,114
because I mean, you did your job well,

614
00:23:43,114 --> 00:23:44,835
because they want to read a good story.

615
00:23:44,835 --> 00:23:44,975
Yes.

616
00:23:44,975 --> 00:23:49,035
Do you have any data regarding how arbitrary

617
00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:51,576
morality systems affect interactive narratives?

618
00:23:52,434 --> 00:23:53,855
Not great data.

619
00:23:53,855 --> 00:23:55,856
We haven't done a lot with morality systems.

620
00:23:55,856 --> 00:23:58,258
In the Demi game, we did points.

621
00:23:58,258 --> 00:24:00,839
So that was where we balanced your fame, your,

622
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,140
what was it?

623
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,523
It was fame, love, and happiness?

624
00:24:06,523 --> 00:24:07,604
Friendship, something like that.

625
00:24:07,604 --> 00:24:09,105
It's not quite morality, it's a little similar.

626
00:24:09,105 --> 00:24:12,046
We found that, at least for our stories,

627
00:24:12,046 --> 00:24:13,727
they don't actually improve anything at all,

628
00:24:13,727 --> 00:24:15,028
any of our retention, any of our data.

629
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:17,190
They don't hurt it either.

630
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:21,113
So our current data has been that we don't use them

631
00:24:21,113 --> 00:24:22,574
unless it really helps the story.

632
00:24:22,574 --> 00:24:25,237
And if it helps the story, it doesn't hurt to put it in.

633
00:24:25,237 --> 00:24:27,839
But we haven't seen it drastically improve anything either.

634
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:28,099
Question.

635
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:28,199
Hello.

636
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:29,780
Do you feel that part of the problem with replay value

637
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,803
is that there's sites like YouTube

638
00:24:32,803 --> 00:24:38,327
where people can play through it once

639
00:24:38,327 --> 00:24:39,408
and then they'll go,

640
00:24:39,408 --> 00:24:41,030
okay, there's like 11 other endings,

641
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,431
but I'm just gonna go look up the endings

642
00:24:42,431 --> 00:24:43,332
and not play through it?

643
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:48,690
I don't know. I actually feel like YouTube is a response to the problem, but now I'm not talking with that. I'm just talking personally.

644
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:54,477
I think it's that I don't want to go invest—usually a replay I already know isn't going to be so different

645
00:24:54,477 --> 00:24:58,402
that it was worth the 20 or 40 or 60 hours of my time,

646
00:24:58,402 --> 00:25:01,866
just because I haven't seen any games that promote being that different.

647
00:25:02,446 --> 00:25:06,367
So, I don't want to go replay a bunch of stuff I've already seen to see five things I didn't see.

648
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:07,847
I'd rather go to YouTube and be like,

649
00:25:07,847 --> 00:25:11,088
yo, what happens if I go to Prince Charming's house instead?

650
00:25:11,088 --> 00:25:12,269
And then just watch that scene.

651
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:14,969
So, my hunch is it's the investment it takes.

652
00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:16,830
I'm actually going to go, I'm totally promoting another speaker,

653
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:18,630
I'm going to try and go to the Life is Strange talk

654
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:20,391
because I think it was a really interesting mechanic they used

655
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:22,591
where you could just rewind in the moment

656
00:25:22,591 --> 00:25:25,332
and then watch what would have taken, happened on your other branch.

657
00:25:25,332 --> 00:25:26,512
And I'm hoping they talk about that

658
00:25:26,512 --> 00:25:28,733
and I'm curious to see how that affected their story.

659
00:25:29,204 --> 00:25:29,504
Thank you.

660
00:25:29,504 --> 00:25:29,684
Yeah.

661
00:25:29,684 --> 00:25:31,305
I have a question there.

662
00:25:31,305 --> 00:25:33,006
So what is your target audience?

663
00:25:33,006 --> 00:25:37,348
It seems like you might have a strict scope there.

664
00:25:37,348 --> 00:25:41,610
So do you have adults or other kids?

665
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:42,711
Can you say the question again?

666
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:45,752
So your target audience, who are actually

667
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,154
reading your stories or playing the game?

668
00:25:48,154 --> 00:25:49,394
Who's our target audience?

669
00:25:49,394 --> 00:25:53,236
Right now, we're predominantly women ages 13 to 25.

670
00:25:53,236 --> 00:25:55,097
And we're just kind of slowly expanding that vertical

671
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:56,098
as we look at other stories.

672
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:59,564
Yes, do you want to hop up to a mic?

673
00:25:59,564 --> 00:26:02,325
Or can I, I'll repeat your question, it's okay.

674
00:26:02,325 --> 00:26:03,225
It's all good.

675
00:26:03,225 --> 00:26:05,245
And then I'll hop over here.

676
00:26:05,245 --> 00:26:08,306
I feel like there's a real lack of data in the industry

677
00:26:08,306 --> 00:26:10,186
about how players interact with story,

678
00:26:10,186 --> 00:26:12,607
and I think that your data is incredibly valuable,

679
00:26:12,607 --> 00:26:14,567
and that's why people are interested in it.

680
00:26:14,567 --> 00:26:16,048
So is there, do you have any more data

681
00:26:16,048 --> 00:26:17,628
outside the context of this talk

682
00:26:17,628 --> 00:26:18,828
that is publicly available?

683
00:26:19,357 --> 00:26:21,238
That is a great question, and when I get back,

684
00:26:21,238 --> 00:26:23,179
I will see if I can make some publicly available.

685
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:26,701
Because we have a ton of data that we look at what influences

686
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:27,601
the choices people make.

687
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:29,903
Again, like seeing that yes, no, and maybe actually does

688
00:26:29,903 --> 00:26:32,944
generate bad response rates.

689
00:26:32,944 --> 00:26:37,127
So I will aim to make more available, for sure.

690
00:26:37,127 --> 00:26:39,488
If you can't make the data itself available,

691
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,889
I would love to have more information

692
00:26:40,889 --> 00:26:41,849
on how you collect it as well.

693
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:42,129
Sure.

694
00:26:42,129 --> 00:26:43,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

695
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,911
Do you want to hop up to a mic?

696
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:45,631
OK, great.

697
00:26:45,631 --> 00:26:45,791
Yes.

698
00:26:48,728 --> 00:26:53,151
Hi, I was sort of curious about the replayability as well.

699
00:26:53,151 --> 00:26:54,612
Personally, for me, there's a lot of games

700
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,073
I don't ever want to replay.

701
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:58,715
But I love talking with other people

702
00:26:58,715 --> 00:27:02,538
about different things that happen because we

703
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,379
made different choices.

704
00:27:04,379 --> 00:27:07,401
Me and my boyfriend will play games explicitly setting out

705
00:27:07,401 --> 00:27:09,922
to make different choices, and then

706
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:12,264
either watch each other play or just talk

707
00:27:12,264 --> 00:27:15,106
about completely wildly different scenarios.

708
00:27:16,447 --> 00:27:19,889
Do you see that in your data? Like watching forums or something?

709
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:23,272
We do, yeah, so asking like do people share their information from their replay.

710
00:27:23,272 --> 00:27:25,894
That's, or from their replay from their experiences, that sort of stuff.

711
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:26,855
Playing with each other.

712
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:29,597
Um, that's actually a big, I'm glad you're asking something I didn't really talk about.

713
00:27:29,597 --> 00:27:34,181
It's a big reason why even though we don't see branching really affecting replayability for us,

714
00:27:34,181 --> 00:27:37,284
we still think branching feels right and it feels like a good thing to do.

715
00:27:37,284 --> 00:27:41,287
Because what we see is our players, I'm mostly looking at our Instagrams and our forum,

716
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:43,088
which is where most of our players hang out.

717
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:47,571
They are so excited to share when they've experienced a different scene.

718
00:27:47,571 --> 00:27:51,334
In the Demi story, we let you pick the gender of who you date,

719
00:27:51,334 --> 00:27:53,455
how you want to identify, who you want them to be,

720
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:56,257
and they have a huge time talking about,

721
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:59,620
oh, well, but if this character is a woman, do they act different?

722
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,561
How does your scene go?

723
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:03,542
So that's shown us that having at least some branching

724
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:06,344
and some feeling that I have customized my story,

725
00:28:06,344 --> 00:28:08,226
that people seem to enjoy that,

726
00:28:08,226 --> 00:28:10,707
and we definitely see that our stories with more branching

727
00:28:10,707 --> 00:28:12,208
get more online engagement.

728
00:28:12,629 --> 00:28:14,292
So that for sure is true.

729
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:18,459
Our single narrative stories get almost no online engagement whatsoever.

730
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:37,224
Thank you. So basically, during your speech, you mentioned that having choices allows the player to personalize their experience, but they have to feel, you know, impactful instead of being instead of being impactful for fear of, you know, not like just, you know, potentially wrecking the story.

731
00:28:37,224 --> 00:28:41,766
Then you also mentioned how a story can serve as a great like.

732
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:48,849
a great base for you know a malleable base for you know uh putting choices as well as you know

733
00:28:48,849 --> 00:28:56,033
branching paths and so on so i would like to know how do you like maintain a balance between choices

734
00:28:56,033 --> 00:29:02,596
and a concrete story because you know obviously you want to make sure that the choices like

735
00:29:02,596 --> 00:29:06,538
are like it's quality over quantity so i'm just curious

736
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:13,006
Yeah, so I think that it's a great question. So talking about how we balance the story with the choices and the branches,

737
00:29:13,006 --> 00:29:16,750
the biggest thing we do is we always have that outline that we did at the very start open.

738
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,775
And if we feel like what we're writing is about to make us go back to an outline phase,

739
00:29:20,775 --> 00:29:24,119
if it is that big a change that we have to go reassess the outline,

740
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:26,582
we'll actually as a whole team say like, pause for a second.

741
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:31,185
is this choice worth it? Is this branch worth it? Do we love this choice enough

742
00:29:31,185 --> 00:29:34,248
that we are willing to go backwards in that little step of

743
00:29:34,248 --> 00:29:37,030
story, then branches, then script, then choice?

744
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:40,972
And sometimes the answer is yes. Sometimes like with the Demi example I

745
00:29:40,972 --> 00:29:43,814
showed with your sister, we did go back and re-outline some stuff because we

746
00:29:43,814 --> 00:29:46,637
felt it was important. But generally we always say if it's

747
00:29:46,637 --> 00:29:50,659
going to force us to go back a step, we won't do it. We'll move, we'll find a

748
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:53,381
different choice. All right, thank you. Yeah, of course.

749
00:29:54,622 --> 00:29:55,824
Okay, that's my last one.

750
00:29:55,824 --> 00:29:59,671
Okay, I'm going to go into the wrap-up room.

751
00:29:59,671 --> 00:29:59,751
It's 3-0-2-2.

752
00:29:59,751 --> 00:30:02,435
It's just around the corner, apparently.

753
00:30:02,435 --> 00:30:04,539
So, I'll talk to you guys there. Thanks so much.
