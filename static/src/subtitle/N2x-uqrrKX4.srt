1
00:00:06,038 --> 00:00:10,259
Welcome to the Narrative Summit 2019.

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,280
Who's here for the first time?

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,820
A bunch of you.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,840
Okay, welcome.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,281
For those of you who are veterans,

6
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:23,461
Tom is not around today,

7
00:00:24,242 --> 00:00:27,082
so we're all going to introduce ourselves very well.

8
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,123
I'm Clara Fernanda-Tvara.

9
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:30,403
I'm Matthew Weiss.

10
00:00:31,811 --> 00:00:36,013
And we are going to introduce you to the narrative innovation showcase.

11
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:38,074
This is a fourth year running that we're doing it.

12
00:00:39,455 --> 00:00:43,537
As you come in, please come to the front, make friends,

13
00:00:43,557 --> 00:00:46,159
you know, come to the middle, defrag the room a bit

14
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,800
so that you can facilitate people coming in a bit later

15
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,941
because we might be full.

16
00:00:51,962 --> 00:00:57,545
So, this year we're going to show you all a bunch of new games

17
00:00:57,605 --> 00:00:58,986
that we wanted to share with you.

18
00:01:00,847 --> 00:01:00,987
And...

19
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:02,951
We have a welcome slide.

20
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:06,453
Is there something wrong with the slides?

21
00:01:08,814 --> 00:01:09,254
There you go.

22
00:01:09,614 --> 00:01:10,594
Yeah, it works.

23
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:10,975
Okay.

24
00:01:11,935 --> 00:01:12,915
We already did our introduction.

25
00:01:13,195 --> 00:01:13,375
Yes.

26
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:13,896
So here we go.

27
00:01:13,936 --> 00:01:14,536
We know who we are.

28
00:01:15,496 --> 00:01:15,656
Okay.

29
00:01:16,097 --> 00:01:20,578
So please remember that you'll receive some evaluations on your email.

30
00:01:20,638 --> 00:01:24,080
Please fill them out so that we know how to do...

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,742
We'll do well today, I hope, but we'll do even better every year.

32
00:01:31,182 --> 00:01:34,523
So the goal of this showcase, for those of you who have not seen it before,

33
00:01:34,543 --> 00:01:37,985
is to highlight the cutting edge of the practice of narrative design.

34
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:41,045
Okay, so this year we have a particularly striking collection of games

35
00:01:42,086 --> 00:01:45,647
that are very different from each other, including dungeon crawlers, platformers, and even card games.

36
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:53,069
And first up, we have Lost Words by Mark Backler.

37
00:02:00,452 --> 00:02:00,952
Thanks very much.

38
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:01,793
Hi, everyone.

39
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:05,376
I'm Mark Backler, and I'm the founder of Sketchbook Games.

40
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:10,079
And I'm here to talk to you about using words as game

41
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,560
mechanics.

42
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,383
And this is in terms of our project Lost Words Beyond the

43
00:02:14,403 --> 00:02:20,688
Page, which is a atmospheric puzzler game half set inside

44
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,709
the pages of a diary.

45
00:02:22,293 --> 00:02:25,575
and half set in a fantasy world called Astoria.

46
00:02:26,136 --> 00:02:28,257
It's about this young girl called Izzy

47
00:02:28,337 --> 00:02:29,918
who's aspiring to be a writer

48
00:02:30,338 --> 00:02:32,700
and her gran is helping to mentor her.

49
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,802
But when her gran gets ill and has a stroke,

50
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:40,105
Izzy starts to use the fantasy world of Astoria

51
00:02:40,145 --> 00:02:42,947
that she's writing about as a means of coping

52
00:02:43,007 --> 00:02:44,688
with what's going on in the real world.

53
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:48,031
So let's take a quick look at the trailer

54
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:49,431
so you can see what the game's all about.

55
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:57,999
So as you can see here, we're running along the words and using them as platforms, but you can also

56
00:02:58,899 --> 00:03:02,982
drag them around the screen and use them to solve different puzzles.

57
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:13,050
Also at some points to make choices that affect the fantasy world, which we then transition into here.

58
00:03:15,102 --> 00:03:18,664
So in the historian section, you're not walking on the words,

59
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:22,625
but you are using them to interact with the world in different ways.

60
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:35,431
We've also got this word book with you at the top left of the screen there,

61
00:03:35,871 --> 00:03:38,532
and that allows you to carry some of the words with you,

62
00:03:38,592 --> 00:03:41,593
so you can use them at different points throughout the level.

63
00:03:47,823 --> 00:03:53,204
So the challenge that we've been looking to overcome

64
00:03:53,364 --> 00:03:56,265
has been how to use words as game mechanics

65
00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:58,846
to help tell an emotionally moving story,

66
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:03,107
but while also remaining localizable for other languages.

67
00:04:05,308 --> 00:04:07,108
There has been other games that have done

68
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:10,049
interesting things with text, including Typo Man,

69
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:14,350
Epistory, Today I Die, Typewriter, and also Letters,

70
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,331
which is a game that's currently in development.

71
00:04:17,698 --> 00:04:20,500
on show at GDC here if you get a chance to check that out.

72
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:25,964
We've tried to tackle the problem in three different ways.

73
00:04:26,524 --> 00:04:29,906
Firstly, by ensuring that the gameplay and story help

74
00:04:29,946 --> 00:04:30,607
serve each other.

75
00:04:33,429 --> 00:04:36,711
Then by trying to use metaphors to make the gameplay more

76
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:37,792
powerful and moving.

77
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:43,556
And also by using localization to try and allow

78
00:04:43,576 --> 00:04:45,577
as many people as possible to experience

79
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:46,898
the game in their own language.

80
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:53,147
So for us, we've tried to give the gameplay and story

81
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:55,768
equal importance, which sometimes has meant

82
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:59,130
leaving a particular narrative beat on the shelf

83
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:01,332
if we couldn't find the gameplay to fit with it,

84
00:05:01,452 --> 00:05:04,154
or sometimes icing a really cool mechanic

85
00:05:04,534 --> 00:05:06,895
because it didn't work with the narrative.

86
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:11,038
And while it was a shame to lose those individual parts,

87
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:13,600
it makes the experience stronger

88
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,141
and more cohesive as a whole.

89
00:05:18,425 --> 00:05:21,127
So here's the most exciting thing that we realized

90
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,208
when making the game.

91
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,511
Anything that we ask the player to do

92
00:05:26,692 --> 00:05:28,254
is something that they will feel.

93
00:05:28,894 --> 00:05:31,276
And so therefore, it carries meaning.

94
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,300
So let's take a look at an example of this.

95
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:38,903
On this level, in one sense, you solve the simple puzzle

96
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,885
to turn the words into platforms to get

97
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:44,008
to the tear on the side of the screen there to progress.

98
00:05:46,495 --> 00:05:48,036
but there's a real meaning that we're driving at

99
00:05:48,196 --> 00:05:50,137
by organizing the level this way.

100
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:53,859
Izzy has aspirations, she's trying to order the future,

101
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,520
so players putting the words in place and leading upwards

102
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,342
is a way of emphasizing that narrative expression.

103
00:06:03,463 --> 00:06:06,945
Here's another example where we see and experience

104
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:09,666
how Izzy is overwriting her memories of the past

105
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:11,847
and we're making the player responsible for that.

106
00:06:13,684 --> 00:06:16,126
They must overwrite these memories by moving across them

107
00:06:16,226 --> 00:06:17,127
in order to progress.

108
00:06:18,187 --> 00:06:21,190
We're trying to put the player in the same emotional space

109
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,630
as Izzy.

110
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,992
So here she's worried about her memories of her gran,

111
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:28,555
and we're seeing them replaced with images of her gran

112
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,836
sick in her hospital bed.

113
00:06:32,297 --> 00:06:35,540
This level actually came about as a bit of an accident of,

114
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,422
I was playing around in Unity with kinematic physics,

115
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:41,064
and then when I jumped on the sentences,

116
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:42,846
they all fell away from underneath me,

117
00:06:43,747 --> 00:06:45,708
which really surprised me.

118
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:49,071
And so then when we had the narrative beat

119
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,433
of Izzy's Gran having her stroke,

120
00:06:51,473 --> 00:06:53,535
which is an unexpected moment in the story,

121
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:56,357
we felt that that would actually be a really good fit

122
00:06:56,697 --> 00:07:00,961
of this point of the story with that particular mechanic.

123
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:05,413
This narrative beat is about inversion of Izzy's world

124
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:08,394
and the profound confusion that her grand stroke causes.

125
00:07:08,935 --> 00:07:10,715
And the delivery of this beat through gameplay,

126
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,656
through the letters falling away,

127
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:15,317
is an eloquent expression of that meaning.

128
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:18,899
Izzy's world is dramatically disrupted.

129
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,405
So finally, with our localization system,

130
00:07:28,206 --> 00:07:30,128
as you can see here, even a single word

131
00:07:30,168 --> 00:07:32,471
can be quite a different length in different languages,

132
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:34,934
which poses quite a problem for us in a game

133
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:37,937
when even changing a word by a couple of letters

134
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:39,379
can break a level.

135
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:45,057
So when one of our original programmers started with us, Audrey Prophet,

136
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:50,979
one of her first tasks was to come up with a scaling collision box

137
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:53,460
that adjusts automatically based on the length of the text,

138
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,322
because we were finding we were spending hours tuning things,

139
00:07:57,342 --> 00:07:58,943
and then we would change a couple of words,

140
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:00,183
and you'd have to go back and redo it.

141
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:02,284
So this saved us a lot of time.

142
00:08:03,739 --> 00:08:06,840
Another one of the programmers on the team,

143
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,902
Khan Bianco, is the one who wrote the smart localization

144
00:08:10,963 --> 00:08:11,323
system.

145
00:08:12,403 --> 00:08:15,545
So this allows us to make changes

146
00:08:15,765 --> 00:08:17,246
on a per-language basis.

147
00:08:17,886 --> 00:08:21,708
So we can see here that we can switch between the languages

148
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:22,269
on the fly.

149
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:25,811
And you can see some of the different problems we've got.

150
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:29,713
Sometimes, like here in Spanish, some of the draggable words

151
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:32,655
are appearing over the text on the page.

152
00:08:33,986 --> 00:08:36,527
And then in other languages like German,

153
00:08:36,968 --> 00:08:39,689
the three draggable words aren't appearing on a single line

154
00:08:39,749 --> 00:08:41,810
like they should be, but the system allows us

155
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,432
to move all those around and change it per language

156
00:08:44,632 --> 00:08:45,913
and then save that out.

157
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:51,030
This is our localization spreadsheet here.

158
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,852
So you can see the different languages down the bottom.

159
00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:56,453
And if we zoom in, you can see that we

160
00:08:56,653 --> 00:09:00,435
use different parentheses to denote

161
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:02,016
different types of words.

162
00:09:02,436 --> 00:09:04,858
So the localizers can just move these around,

163
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,759
and then the game will automatically pick it up.

164
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,922
And so if we needed more or less interactive words

165
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:14,423
in a different language, or they needed

166
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:16,304
to be at a different place in the sentence,

167
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:17,384
they can easily do that.

168
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,948
So here we've got the square brackets denoting a draggable word

169
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:25,771
and curly brackets denoting a blue word

170
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:29,874
that's one of our trigger words that causes something to happen when you stand on it.

171
00:09:30,955 --> 00:09:34,298
So we can see this system in action here

172
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:38,802
by dragging one of our smart sentence prefabs into the scene

173
00:09:39,102 --> 00:09:43,025
and then you literally just paste the text tag in and it auto-populates it

174
00:09:43,045 --> 00:09:45,768
with all the different types of words.

175
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:49,867
And so that saves us a lot of time,

176
00:09:50,127 --> 00:09:53,190
and it makes it a lot more doable

177
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:58,055
for translating the game to lots of different languages.

178
00:09:58,135 --> 00:10:00,558
Because with it being a word-based game,

179
00:10:00,838 --> 00:10:03,481
it makes a big impact for people if they can play it

180
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:04,722
in their own language.

181
00:10:08,938 --> 00:10:11,300
To summarize, we've used text in unusual ways

182
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,902
to form word-based gameplay through metaphors

183
00:10:14,002 --> 00:10:15,724
and careful planning, but with puzzles

184
00:10:15,764 --> 00:10:17,905
that can still be translated to different languages.

185
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:22,028
But ours isn't the first or only way of doing this.

186
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:26,812
This slide always takes a little while to load.

187
00:10:26,832 --> 00:10:27,592
I think that's going to cut you.

188
00:10:27,612 --> 00:10:27,973
There we go.

189
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:32,176
So perhaps you might like to try using gameplay or metaphors

190
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:35,238
or using text to provide an unusual mechanic

191
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:36,559
for your next project.

192
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:42,624
And Lost Words is gonna be out later this year.

193
00:10:43,364 --> 00:10:43,864
Thanks very much.

194
00:10:43,884 --> 00:10:43,904
-. . . . .

195
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,832
. . . Next, yes, it's Tiny X Short talking about

196
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:56,732
Boyfriend Dungeon.

197
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:06,151
So you might know me as the captain of Kid Fox Games.

198
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:08,914
We recently announced we're also publishing Dwarf Fortress,

199
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:10,816
which is its own narrative innovation

200
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:11,877
I'm not talking about today.

201
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,421
But yeah, today I'm gonna be talking about Boyfriend Engine.

202
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:17,102
Who here knows about Boyfriend Engine?

203
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,104
Most of you, but not everybody, so I'm just going to give a very quick overview.

204
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,166
It is a dungeon crawler.

205
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:27,991
It's an action RPG where you beat up monsters and take their loot as you do, trying to get

206
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:31,474
deeper in the dungeon, but then when you find weapons, they turn into beautiful people,

207
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:35,598
and you date them to level them up and make them more powerful.

208
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:36,820
It's great.

209
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:38,822
But the problem...

210
00:11:41,216 --> 00:11:44,261
is how do you actually tell this story?

211
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:48,066
How do you tell a story between two genres

212
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:51,871
with very different narratives embedded in their mechanics?

213
00:11:52,452 --> 00:11:55,196
Dungeons are about violence, they're about conflict,

214
00:11:55,557 --> 00:11:56,338
they're about power.

215
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:01,040
Dating is about intimacy and trust.

216
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:02,981
We honestly weren't sure,

217
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:06,202
other than putting in some cute people at first,

218
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:08,523
how to make these things work together.

219
00:12:08,643 --> 00:12:10,204
There have been many games in the past

220
00:12:10,244 --> 00:12:12,064
that have tried a few different things,

221
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:15,645
but we really wanted to have the most aligned story

222
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:17,326
with the underlying mechanics, right?

223
00:12:17,366 --> 00:12:19,647
Like that's the dream of a narrative designer.

224
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:24,250
So first, we tried to do the best practices.

225
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,451
We were like, okay, what are our design pillars?

226
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:29,414
So we were like, okay, romance, yes.

227
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:31,215
Fantasy, yes.

228
00:12:31,555 --> 00:12:34,337
And we thought maybe playful would help bring them together

229
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:36,239
from a philosophical perspective.

230
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,601
If it's consensual and safe to experiment

231
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:40,782
and it's quick and surprising,

232
00:12:40,822 --> 00:12:43,905
like all of that can kind of blend together romance

233
00:12:44,065 --> 00:12:46,006
and the fantasy of becoming more powerful

234
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:46,887
while also becoming...

235
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,269
more attractive and more confident.

236
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:55,215
And we did feel like we were getting somewhere when we realized that almost every romance

237
00:12:55,295 --> 00:12:58,779
novel has the explicit theme of being stronger together.

238
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,083
That sounds both like a dungeon kind of theme and a dating kind of theme, right?

239
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,524
That's great.

240
00:13:03,924 --> 00:13:05,506
But what do you actually do with that?

241
00:13:06,707 --> 00:13:08,048
You have these design pillars, and that's cool.

242
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:10,490
I can review all my scenes, and I can review all my dialogue,

243
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,131
and make sure that my characters are all

244
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:13,192
emphasizing all this theme.

245
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:15,654
But what are the actual mechanics behind this?

246
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,376
And so as a game designer, my first instinct

247
00:13:18,637 --> 00:13:22,260
was to take the stuff from one half that you get.

248
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,881
Obviously, you build power in the dungeon,

249
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,282
and you build love in the dates.

250
00:13:25,662 --> 00:13:26,063
And that's great.

251
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,164
And you take them into each other.

252
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:30,106
It didn't actually work that way, and I'm going to explain why.

253
00:13:31,651 --> 00:13:36,316
So, the first thing we did was we were looking at how to get money from the dungeons and

254
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:37,437
then spend them on dates.

255
00:13:38,118 --> 00:13:39,359
That makes logical sense.

256
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,603
Unfortunately, when you try to shoehorn in weird...

257
00:13:46,546 --> 00:13:47,887
Escalating prices.

258
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:50,289
I mean, it's not always this bad.

259
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:51,990
Like sometimes it makes a little more sense.

260
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:54,532
But honestly, the idea that when you start dating,

261
00:13:54,572 --> 00:13:56,474
it's like, here's $5 and then, okay,

262
00:13:56,514 --> 00:13:58,255
I'm not going on date six without $300.

263
00:13:59,596 --> 00:14:00,577
It does end up a bit strange.

264
00:14:00,597 --> 00:14:02,218
Like it doesn't really fit emotionally.

265
00:14:02,859 --> 00:14:04,260
So that was a no-go.

266
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:05,982
But then we were thinking,

267
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:08,283
okay, maybe we can take dates into the dungeons.

268
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:12,147
Maybe we can somehow just push them together.

269
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,088
And that worked a little bit better.

270
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:17,210
We did end up having little hangouts you can see in our teasers,

271
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,931
where if you're running around the dungeon, you'll come across these special points

272
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:23,412
where you can learn a little bit more about the weapon you're wielding.

273
00:14:23,432 --> 00:14:25,673
They'll transform and be like, hey, what's up?

274
00:14:27,294 --> 00:14:31,055
The problem is that this doesn't really support full-on dates,

275
00:14:31,215 --> 00:14:33,936
because when you're in dungeon mode emotionally,

276
00:14:34,136 --> 00:14:35,497
you're at an adrenaline high.

277
00:14:36,717 --> 00:14:39,979
We spent a lot of time working on the pacing of the dungeons

278
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:40,779
to support this.

279
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:42,880
You're just mentally not in the brain space

280
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,741
to sit and read a long amount of text.

281
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:49,002
So having little hangouts, as we call them, were great.

282
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,564
It reminded you that your weapon was a person

283
00:14:52,744 --> 00:14:53,464
and they were dating you.

284
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:55,905
But also for the longer dates,

285
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:56,826
that just wasn't going to work.

286
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,907
So we still have the main plot dates outside the dungeon

287
00:15:00,947 --> 00:15:03,348
when you're in calm reading mode.

288
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:08,856
So then we're thinking, well, maybe somehow we should figure out a way for your weapons

289
00:15:08,976 --> 00:15:11,498
to express themselves even during combat.

290
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:16,202
Thankfully, other games have paved the way for this, so it was kind of easy when looking

291
00:15:16,242 --> 00:15:19,625
around to see, okay, like, yeah, your weapon can comment on the different things that you

292
00:15:19,665 --> 00:15:25,510
see, whether it's picking up loot or attacking monsters or getting attacked or dying or whatever.

293
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:27,192
Your weapon can be there.

294
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:29,293
and having the different weapons respond

295
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,213
in different ways to that.

296
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,413
Like some of the weapons are a little more nurturing,

297
00:15:32,834 --> 00:15:34,554
some of them are a little more edgy.

298
00:15:36,414 --> 00:15:36,734
Sorry.

299
00:15:37,695 --> 00:15:38,455
It's hard to resist.

300
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:40,735
So yeah, that was great.

301
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:42,096
We called them dungeon comments.

302
00:15:43,156 --> 00:15:45,337
And they're pretty high bang for buck there.

303
00:15:45,357 --> 00:15:47,157
And then we started thinking,

304
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,017
how do we do it the other way?

305
00:15:48,057 --> 00:15:50,238
How do we shove the dungeons into the dating?

306
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:52,640
well, maybe you find new characters in the dungeon.

307
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,781
Yep, you find weapons, they turn into people.

308
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:55,542
That works great.

309
00:15:55,702 --> 00:15:57,143
Okay, cool, that's great.

310
00:15:57,283 --> 00:16:02,087
But what if dialogue choices gave you combat stats?

311
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:04,528
That would make sense, right?

312
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,650
Maybe when someone flirts with you,

313
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,792
it's like if you aggressively flirt back,

314
00:16:08,832 --> 00:16:09,812
you get attack points.

315
00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:13,335
And if you are a little bit shy, you get defense points.

316
00:16:13,495 --> 00:16:15,096
And if you're funny, you get luck points.

317
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:17,058
All of that is very on theme.

318
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:19,099
You're getting stronger together, it's great.

319
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:24,556
The problem is that whether or not you show,

320
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,117
so we started out by showing the stats,

321
00:16:26,497 --> 00:16:28,218
that you would definitely get an attack by doing this,

322
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,900
you'd definitely get a defense by doing this.

323
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,943
And the problem is that at best, people felt conflicted.

324
00:16:33,963 --> 00:16:37,886
They'd think, well, what I really want to do is flirt back,

325
00:16:38,006 --> 00:16:39,527
but I really need some more defense.

326
00:16:41,088 --> 00:16:43,150
You know, you would think that would be an interesting decision.

327
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,152
It's actually just a difficult decision.

328
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:50,456
And there is a difference, because not all difficult decisions are interesting.

329
00:16:51,397 --> 00:16:56,261
So for example, to make this a less explicit conflict, we tried hiding the stats.

330
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:01,926
Our consultant Christine Love predicted this would result in actually more frustration.

331
00:17:02,807 --> 00:17:04,630
because what would happen is people would play through,

332
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,473
find out what stat they got and be like,

333
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:08,596
screw you guys, I'm doing that again

334
00:17:08,676 --> 00:17:10,740
because I need a defense point, thank you very much.

335
00:17:11,681 --> 00:17:13,664
And they'd in fact be compelled to replay it.

336
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:17,190
And I doubted her very briefly and did one play test.

337
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:18,831
Never again.

338
00:17:20,352 --> 00:17:21,813
So we removed all the combat stats.

339
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:25,094
And essentially the problem was that

340
00:17:25,614 --> 00:17:28,175
by providing an extrinsic arbitrary reward,

341
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,076
we were absolutely undermining the value

342
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:31,236
of the intrinsic reward.

343
00:17:31,437 --> 00:17:32,637
When you want to flirt with someone,

344
00:17:32,697 --> 00:17:34,278
you don't want the game telling you

345
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:35,798
to think about something else.

346
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:38,800
The intrinsic pleasure of flirting with a cute dagger

347
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,661
is untouchable, you know?

348
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:43,061
Like you shouldn't be messing with that

349
00:17:43,101 --> 00:17:44,862
with your plus one attack and your plus one defense.

350
00:17:45,623 --> 00:17:47,483
That is only as valuable as the game says it is.

351
00:17:48,124 --> 00:17:49,625
and you feel a little bit helpless

352
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:52,107
when the extrinsic rewards are in your face.

353
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:53,828
So we took that out.

354
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:56,771
You do actually still get some points.

355
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:57,951
Like if you're dating the dagger,

356
00:17:58,052 --> 00:17:59,573
generally you'll get one kind of point.

357
00:17:59,613 --> 00:18:00,934
If you're dating this other weapon,

358
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,235
you'll generally get a different kind of point.

359
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:06,959
But by divorcing it from the individual dialogue choices,

360
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:08,460
it feels a lot more meaningful.

361
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,361
That you are getting stronger together,

362
00:18:10,802 --> 00:18:12,463
but not because you're saying one thing

363
00:18:12,523 --> 00:18:13,464
or saying a different thing.

364
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:14,705
It's because you're spending time.

365
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:19,858
And then maybe the easiest one of all was trying to think of,

366
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,519
well, how do you improve combat through intimacy?

367
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:29,044
And that is every plot point with a different weapon.

368
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:32,446
You get to love rank up, and you choose your skill tree.

369
00:18:32,526 --> 00:18:32,947
And that's great.

370
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:34,488
You definitely get stronger together that way.

371
00:18:34,908 --> 00:18:35,388
So that was great.

372
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:37,651
And what we learned through all of these patterns

373
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:40,334
was rather than taking the power from dungeons

374
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:41,234
and using them in dating,

375
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:42,696
and using love from dating in dungeons,

376
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:43,837
it's actually the opposite.

377
00:18:44,258 --> 00:18:45,859
The power comes from dating,

378
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,321
and the love comes from dungeons.

379
00:18:47,521 --> 00:18:48,722
So what ends up happening is that

380
00:18:48,762 --> 00:18:51,185
while you're playing one half of the game,

381
00:18:51,285 --> 00:18:52,146
one genre of the game,

382
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:54,849
you are always thinking about the other half,

383
00:18:54,989 --> 00:18:57,311
and it unites them mentally and emotionally.

384
00:18:58,507 --> 00:18:59,687
It was infinitely more satisfying.

385
00:19:00,227 --> 00:19:02,289
So then we had a final problem to solve,

386
00:19:02,749 --> 00:19:05,490
which is the marketing evil side

387
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,051
of what if we make this game and nobody wants it?

388
00:19:09,112 --> 00:19:10,593
Originally, Boyfriend Dungeon was actually

389
00:19:10,713 --> 00:19:11,853
about astrological signs.

390
00:19:14,215 --> 00:19:16,396
We designed characters that would be paired,

391
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:21,018
and our audience on Steam who liked dungeon crawlers

392
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:22,719
and dating sims seemed to want something else.

393
00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:28,439
This was March 2017, and they all seem to have something in common.

394
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,081
It's worth noting mobile games are much healthier in this respect, but we fundamentally had

395
00:19:34,101 --> 00:19:40,302
a crisis of how do we make random Steam gamer number five less alienated by him?

396
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:45,163
They're not actively sexualized all the time, but they're still pretty sexy.

397
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:50,764
And we have some lovely women, but pure diversity was not going to solve the problem because

398
00:19:50,864 --> 00:19:53,205
at the end of the day, they are not this, right?

399
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,190
But we did turn up a few exceptions.

400
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,372
There were a few oddball dating sims

401
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:01,593
that were selling equally well, if not better.

402
00:20:01,613 --> 00:20:04,015
And at the end of the day, we found

403
00:20:04,055 --> 00:20:07,437
that people were just less ready to be alienated

404
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:08,437
if they were laughing.

405
00:20:08,978 --> 00:20:12,300
And in fact, they didn't even see this as a deceptive trick.

406
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:16,843
They're willing to engage in something as a joke,

407
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:18,604
and if it's sufficiently entertaining,

408
00:20:19,044 --> 00:20:21,186
they'll actually stay a little bit more open-minded.

409
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:24,433
So what we do is we take the discomfort

410
00:20:26,154 --> 00:20:28,156
and you add in a little bit of absurdity.

411
00:20:28,617 --> 00:20:30,598
And it's a little bit of a judo throw of somebody

412
00:20:30,638 --> 00:20:31,619
who's on the defensive.

413
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,983
So we intentionally made the premise more absurd.

414
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:39,466
We were like, astrological signs, not silly enough.

415
00:20:40,227 --> 00:20:42,549
And so when the idea of weapons turning into people was there,

416
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,411
yes, that is the way.

417
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,513
Because when they're laughing, then we have them.

418
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,062
So that's our main strategy and how to make our hybrid work

419
00:20:50,162 --> 00:20:52,764
even on a sometimes contentious platform like Steam.

420
00:20:53,405 --> 00:20:53,945
Wish us luck.

421
00:20:54,206 --> 00:20:54,646
Thank you.

422
00:21:02,074 --> 00:21:08,140
Okay, next up is Alan Turner talking about when rivers were trails.

423
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:20,818
Thank you.

424
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:39,295
introduce myself and Lakota to you all and address any of my relatives who are out there

425
00:21:39,335 --> 00:21:44,257
to say thank you for being here and thank you for this opportunity to speak. I'm here by request

426
00:21:44,577 --> 00:21:48,278
of my relative Elizabeth Lapensay to talk about a game that she designed and directed,

427
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,080
funded by the Indian Land Tenure Foundation with the assistance of myself as a game designer

428
00:21:53,741 --> 00:22:00,604
and writer and with the assistance of a multitude of Native writers and voices. The game is an

429
00:22:00,644 --> 00:22:04,085
ecology of narratives about a fictional character surviving a real world event.

430
00:22:05,553 --> 00:22:08,414
Its form takes inspiration from the Oregon Trail.

431
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,035
How many of you are familiar with the Oregon Trail?

432
00:22:10,715 --> 00:22:11,035
Yay!

433
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:11,635
Okay.

434
00:22:13,596 --> 00:22:16,537
And where the water tastes like wine.

435
00:22:16,777 --> 00:22:17,617
Anybody familiar with this?

436
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:22,199
So our result is a game called Wind Rivers Were Trails.

437
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:30,382
And we had a big challenge ahead of us because this is a game about native experience, right?

438
00:22:30,502 --> 00:22:31,322
It's a game about...

439
00:22:32,062 --> 00:22:33,843
Is anyone here familiar with the Allotment Act?

440
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:34,889
No?

441
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:37,230
OK, so the Allotment Act was a thing

442
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:42,153
that happened in 1887, also called the Dawes Act.

443
00:22:42,573 --> 00:22:45,194
And what it basically did was it took a bunch of reservation

444
00:22:45,234 --> 00:22:49,136
lands and reallotted that land, saying some of this

445
00:22:49,156 --> 00:22:51,257
we're giving back to native peoples and other parts of it.

446
00:22:51,277 --> 00:22:52,838
We're going to open up to settlers to come in

447
00:22:52,878 --> 00:22:55,979
and reclaim this thing and do all this agricultural stuff.

448
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,240
We're going to let the natives be agricultural.

449
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,161
Everyone's going to be happy.

450
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:00,282
It didn't work out that way, which

451
00:23:00,302 --> 00:23:04,163
what we wound up having was a bunch of, oh, we moved.

452
00:23:05,658 --> 00:23:10,701
a bunch of settlers who were coming into Native territories

453
00:23:11,342 --> 00:23:13,803
and they were basically chasing Natives off,

454
00:23:13,823 --> 00:23:15,564
killing the Natives off, taking that land.

455
00:23:15,865 --> 00:23:19,087
There are processes by which if a Native person died in certain ways,

456
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:21,788
then that land can be moved over to a non-Native person.

457
00:23:22,128 --> 00:23:23,629
So he wanted to share that experience,

458
00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:25,070
because it's something you don't hear about in history books,

459
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:27,212
but it's something that was a very real experience

460
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:29,713
for Anishinaabe people in the area.

461
00:23:30,874 --> 00:23:31,955
So this is the game.

462
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:45,973
And so you can see the obvious relationship with where the water tastes like wine.

463
00:23:47,013 --> 00:23:48,994
And then we have lots of these little mini-games.

464
00:23:49,154 --> 00:23:52,936
And these are survival mini-games, or hunting mini-games, or fishing mini-games, or travel

465
00:23:52,956 --> 00:23:53,476
mini-games.

466
00:23:54,176 --> 00:23:56,237
But they're all being seen from the point of view of the...

467
00:23:57,305 --> 00:23:58,325
of the character playing.

468
00:23:58,726 --> 00:24:00,367
So for instance, with fishing and hunting,

469
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:03,529
you can't fish and hunt all day long, right?

470
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,370
You have a limited amount of resources,

471
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,831
but you actually aren't there to kind of fill your gullet

472
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:08,932
with as much stuff as you can.

473
00:24:09,272 --> 00:24:10,853
You're there to kind of work towards

474
00:24:11,053 --> 00:24:12,494
what's necessary for your own survival.

475
00:24:15,556 --> 00:24:20,039
This is also a free game that's available on itch.io

476
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,660
that anyone can download

477
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,261
and is oriented towards an educational market.

478
00:24:28,062 --> 00:24:30,962
So our big challenge with Wind, Rivers, or Trails

479
00:24:31,562 --> 00:24:33,323
was how can a game with indigenous themes

480
00:24:33,523 --> 00:24:35,643
incite, incite, I'm sorry,

481
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:37,184
how can a game with indigenous themes

482
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:39,344
include culturally informed narrative game design?

483
00:24:39,884 --> 00:24:42,745
That is, how do we make a game about natives,

484
00:24:43,165 --> 00:24:45,506
for natives, that helps you feel

485
00:24:45,546 --> 00:24:47,366
like you're experiencing things through a native lens?

486
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,227
As opposed to what normally happens,

487
00:24:51,587 --> 00:24:54,868
this challenge, there's a representational issue, right?

488
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:58,431
Typically, what you get when you get natives in games,

489
00:24:58,451 --> 00:24:59,772
when you get a game about native peoples,

490
00:24:59,992 --> 00:25:01,012
is you get something like this.

491
00:25:02,493 --> 00:25:02,653
Right?

492
00:25:03,354 --> 00:25:06,136
We get characters like Nightwolf, Tala, Turok,

493
00:25:06,616 --> 00:25:07,757
all of which are someone saying,

494
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,138
hey, we included a native person,

495
00:25:09,158 --> 00:25:11,139
there's a native character in this game,

496
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:12,420
it's awesome, look how cool they are,

497
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,801
look how hot she is, look how hot he is,

498
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:18,063
they're all, everyone's hyper-masculine, hyper-sexualized.

499
00:25:20,162 --> 00:25:23,563
But they have this problem that they fulfill

500
00:25:23,744 --> 00:25:25,984
colonizer stereotypes and colonizer fantasies

501
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,765
about what native peoples are as opposed to

502
00:25:28,225 --> 00:25:30,206
speaking at all towards the native experience.

503
00:25:31,686 --> 00:25:33,547
So what we wanted to have is a game where

504
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:34,668
when you engage with a native person,

505
00:25:34,688 --> 00:25:36,708
you're actually engaging with a native person, right?

506
00:25:36,728 --> 00:25:40,150
So this has to be a meaningful interaction

507
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:42,030
with the character where you're learning something

508
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,991
about them as people, not only in terms of like

509
00:25:46,303 --> 00:25:49,945
what their tribe is, but how they exist in the world, how they exist in relation to the

510
00:25:49,985 --> 00:25:50,765
other people around them.

511
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:55,468
So there's this process that we built up, which is all about listening, gifting, and

512
00:25:55,508 --> 00:25:55,808
helping.

513
00:25:55,928 --> 00:26:00,870
That is, you meet someone, and culturally, the inclination is somehow or another to share

514
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,291
and be thankful for that interaction.

515
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:08,057
So these are some screens that show this in process.

516
00:26:08,077 --> 00:26:10,017
So one of the first things you'll notice in these

517
00:26:10,918 --> 00:26:13,298
is that we're using language in everything that we do.

518
00:26:13,898 --> 00:26:15,759
So when you meet a character, that character

519
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,519
is speaking to you in Anishinaabe.

520
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:20,400
And there are some places where you meet people who are Lakota,

521
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,821
some Cree, and a few other different tribal groups.

522
00:26:24,281 --> 00:26:24,841
And you're greeted.

523
00:26:25,842 --> 00:26:29,944
by them in their language and they talk to you on and off in their language and in English.

524
00:26:30,664 --> 00:26:36,047
And sometimes we translate it and sometimes we don't, just to get people in the habit

525
00:26:36,087 --> 00:26:39,369
of actually trying to verbalize and internalize some of that language experience.

526
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:49,094
So there's also this process where the choices you are engaging are relevant to the community.

527
00:26:50,947 --> 00:26:55,269
So that it's not just you walking up with a big inventory of stuff, right?

528
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:56,309
Your inventory doesn't matter.

529
00:26:56,329 --> 00:26:59,251
What it's about is that you're managing abundance.

530
00:26:59,511 --> 00:27:02,612
You come into a space and there are people you're engaging with.

531
00:27:02,712 --> 00:27:03,512
They lack abundance.

532
00:27:03,532 --> 00:27:05,553
You have abundance and you give some of your abundance to them.

533
00:27:06,074 --> 00:27:07,634
And it's not about the particulars of it, right?

534
00:27:07,674 --> 00:27:11,056
It's not about I have, you know, X number of these things

535
00:27:11,116 --> 00:27:12,536
and I'm going to give you X number of these things.

536
00:27:13,077 --> 00:27:16,778
And so, and then once you have done whatever gifting to them,

537
00:27:17,058 --> 00:27:18,099
there's typically a gifting back.

538
00:27:19,183 --> 00:27:24,305
One of the things we want to include is this idea that we want to recognize a person's story as part of their abundance.

539
00:27:24,665 --> 00:27:28,166
So sometimes it's not just giving them food or giving them medicine,

540
00:27:28,226 --> 00:27:34,768
it's also giving them information about where you've been, who you are, what your family is, who you're related to,

541
00:27:34,808 --> 00:27:40,449
because sometimes the information is entertaining, sometimes the information is educational,

542
00:27:40,649 --> 00:27:43,590
letting them know what's coming, letting them know if there's Indian agents in the area,

543
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:45,090
letting them know what animals you've come across.

544
00:27:46,691 --> 00:27:47,531
So speaking of animals...

545
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:59,285
We have a secondary challenge here in that this is a game of, like I said, narrative ecologies, but natural ecologies matter in this.

546
00:27:59,665 --> 00:28:05,909
You are, as a person, someone whose life has been disrupted by an invasive species, right?

547
00:28:05,949 --> 00:28:09,851
There's another group that's come in, and it's just completely terrorizing how your world works, and you're moving out,

548
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:13,133
and you're engaging with other species, and you're causing disruption yourself.

549
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:17,988
So we wanted to include indigenous science in this process.

550
00:28:18,008 --> 00:28:20,350
So it's not just talking to people, it's also engaging nature.

551
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:25,713
But there's a second, just like the issue of representation I talked about before, there's

552
00:28:25,773 --> 00:28:30,916
a second issue of when people think of indigenous peoples and they think of nature, this thing

553
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:36,339
happens where folks start to anthropomorphize the characters and it becomes all about these

554
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:37,279
spirit relationships.

555
00:28:37,379 --> 00:28:40,021
And I've had people come to me and say stuff like, you know, I...

556
00:28:40,621 --> 00:28:44,124
I was going down the road and a crow came and landed on the road in front of me.

557
00:28:44,164 --> 00:28:45,505
What does that mean, Alan? You're Native.

558
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:48,647
I'm like, that means that you're walking down the road

559
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:56,292
and a crow was going somewhere and it stopped and it could care less about you.

560
00:28:58,614 --> 00:29:02,957
So, to kind of break this idea of like we're all kind of hanging out, you know,

561
00:29:02,997 --> 00:29:05,699
in the forest, hugging raccoons, singing songs, everything's happy.

562
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:11,495
We wanted to create an educational experience that kind of didn't allow for that.

563
00:29:12,075 --> 00:29:17,839
So what we wound up with was this space where animals are being communicated with and honored.

564
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:22,062
In the same way that we dealt with humans, we're dealing with animals that way.

565
00:29:24,884 --> 00:29:29,667
Everything is situational, and there wasn't ever really a right way to engage with things.

566
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:35,300
But what we did not want was for animals to be talking heads.

567
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,681
We didn't want them to be stereotyped.

568
00:29:36,701 --> 00:29:38,042
So we didn't want to go back in the old tropes.

569
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:41,025
So the kind of interactions we created

570
00:29:41,545 --> 00:29:43,647
allowed for this interesting range.

571
00:29:44,387 --> 00:29:46,349
One thing that we're doing is making sure

572
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:47,489
you're having encounters with animals

573
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:48,430
that aren't around anymore.

574
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,612
So these are some bighorn sheep.

575
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:54,515
The old bighorn sheep, which were hunted and roamed

576
00:29:54,655 --> 00:29:55,135
in the area.

577
00:29:55,775 --> 00:29:57,937
were wiped out towards the end of the 1800s

578
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:01,800
and replaced by other bighorn sheep that were brought in from Europe.

579
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,383
So what we have now aren't the same animals that were there.

580
00:30:07,866 --> 00:30:10,508
Also, there's this idea that sometimes you would observe and listen,

581
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:13,250
sometimes you would help the animals, sometimes you would hinder,

582
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:16,173
and it wasn't obvious what the right choice was in that situation.

583
00:30:17,543 --> 00:30:20,304
Your engagement with nature fed back into a resource called well-being,

584
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:23,365
which is about your relationship with your ecology

585
00:30:23,425 --> 00:30:26,206
in much the same way that honor with humans

586
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:28,687
is about your relationship with that social ecology.

587
00:30:30,688 --> 00:30:32,729
Sometimes the things you came across were funny,

588
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:34,770
funny moments that were there,

589
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,110
they're kind of an emotional salve

590
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:38,211
for all the terrible stuff that's happening along the way.

591
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:42,272
And sometimes they were just somber and distressing moments

592
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:45,134
that showed you how so many things are being displaced

593
00:30:45,174 --> 00:30:46,274
and how unforgiving nature is.

594
00:30:48,205 --> 00:30:52,651
So the biggest solution that we came across in trying to solve all of these problems was

595
00:30:52,711 --> 00:30:54,113
to engage indigenous voices.

596
00:30:54,714 --> 00:30:55,015
So the

597
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,564
Indian Land Tenure Foundation, which is an amalgamation of tribal groups on the West

598
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:03,885
Coast, funded this.

599
00:31:03,985 --> 00:31:07,847
But what we did was we reached out to indigenous peoples and got them to participate in the

600
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,349
storytelling that populated the work.

601
00:31:09,749 --> 00:31:14,452
We sought writers who were from the affected areas and tribes, explained the narrative

602
00:31:14,472 --> 00:31:17,755
boundaries and invited them to write from experience of self, family, and tribe.

603
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:21,978
More importantly, this collaboration was to result in something meant to give back and

604
00:31:22,018 --> 00:31:23,919
better the overall experience of Native kids in school.

605
00:31:24,894 --> 00:31:28,336
We weren't mining the communities for something we could make a profit on.

606
00:31:29,437 --> 00:31:32,298
We were collaborating with something that would help us share our knowings

607
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:34,820
and help us to be more seen in the world around us.

608
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:35,901
So thank you.

609
00:31:35,921 --> 00:31:45,447
Applause

610
00:31:45,467 --> 00:31:51,330
Next we have Strix Beltran who is going to talk about Bluebeard's Bride.

611
00:31:59,442 --> 00:32:00,603
Just make an adjustment here.

612
00:32:00,623 --> 00:32:02,485
I have many more notes than is usual.

613
00:32:04,387 --> 00:32:05,609
I want them bigger, like that.

614
00:32:05,889 --> 00:32:06,150
Okay.

615
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,892
Hello, good morning everyone,

616
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:10,295
and thanks for joining us for the first talk of the day.

617
00:32:10,735 --> 00:32:13,398
This is my first Narrative Summit talk ever,

618
00:32:13,518 --> 00:32:15,941
so I'm very excited to share this with you, yeah.

619
00:32:19,768 --> 00:32:20,929
So just a quick content warning.

620
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:24,813
This talk includes discussion of violence to women, so you are aware.

621
00:32:25,714 --> 00:32:26,514
So good morning, folks.

622
00:32:26,554 --> 00:32:27,495
My name is Strix.

623
00:32:27,976 --> 00:32:31,559
I'm an award-winning narrative designer for both analog and video games.

624
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,544
And I'm currently a project narrative director at Hidden Path Entertainment in Seattle.

625
00:32:37,424 --> 00:32:42,026
I'm a trained mythologist and the focus of my master's degree was on the intersection

626
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:44,886
between mythology, psychology, and play.

627
00:32:44,906 --> 00:32:46,347
It's fascinating stuff.

628
00:32:47,187 --> 00:32:52,048
So today I'm going to be talking to you about Bluebeard's Bride and harnessing the power

629
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:56,770
of Jungian depth psychology to make really awesome games.

630
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,851
Just curious, does anyone here know about Bluebeard's Bride?

631
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:01,071
Okay, there's some people.

632
00:33:01,571 --> 00:33:01,871
Awesome.

633
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:03,352
You play D&D too, I know it.

634
00:33:06,313 --> 00:33:07,614
Okay, so what is Bluebeard's Bride?

635
00:33:08,434 --> 00:33:10,235
Bluebeard's Bride is a game that I co-designed

636
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:12,796
with two other women, Sarah Richardson and Marissa Kelly.

637
00:33:13,277 --> 00:33:15,038
We developed it over the course of two years

638
00:33:15,598 --> 00:33:18,119
and took it to Kickstarter with a $5,000 funding goal.

639
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,701
The Kickstarter raised $130,000.

640
00:33:22,782 --> 00:33:25,103
The game went on to be nominated for a handful of awards

641
00:33:25,724 --> 00:33:28,405
and came away with IndieCade's Grand Jury Prize in 2018,

642
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:31,287
as well as winning the IGDN's Best Art Category

643
00:33:31,427 --> 00:33:33,268
and Game of the Year, so we're very proud.

644
00:33:34,649 --> 00:33:40,530
So Bluebird's Bride is a feminine horror tabletop role-playing game based off of the original

645
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:44,632
fairy tale of a young woman who marries a mysterious man with a string of missing wives

646
00:33:45,172 --> 00:33:46,332
who came before her.

647
00:33:46,912 --> 00:33:51,774
It's a game for five players and a facilitator and it takes about four to six hours to play.

648
00:33:53,034 --> 00:33:57,256
It's a one-shot, meaning that the game ends in a single session and you can replay it

649
00:33:57,276 --> 00:34:01,577
again for a very different feel and outcomes by choosing different characters and moves.

650
00:34:02,837 --> 00:34:03,477
Here is the catch.

651
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:07,099
The players all play the same person, the bride.

652
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:11,380
If you are familiar with the tale of Bluebeard, you know that the marriage is doomed.

653
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,861
Bluebeard sets up a psychological trap for his new wife by saying she can go into any

654
00:34:16,902 --> 00:34:22,823
room in the castle that she wants, save one, and when she does, he murders her and sticks

655
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:23,363
her in a closet.

656
00:34:23,584 --> 00:34:23,684
So.

657
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:32,184
Each of these players play a character that is an aspect of the bride's psyche.

658
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:37,487
We call them sisters, but if you are familiar with Indian depth psychology, you'll recognize

659
00:34:37,527 --> 00:34:40,108
them as complexes, and we'll talk about those in a minute.

660
00:34:40,928 --> 00:34:45,390
So together they explore Bluebeard's castle, trying to decide if he's a good guy or if

661
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,851
the bride should try to get out of there.

662
00:34:47,311 --> 00:34:52,333
And at the end, they're invariably drawn to a confrontation where the final room, and

663
00:34:52,353 --> 00:34:53,974
spoilers, nothing good happens.

664
00:34:56,574 --> 00:34:57,496
So the challenge.

665
00:34:58,497 --> 00:34:59,739
In a game of feminine horror,

666
00:34:59,779 --> 00:35:02,543
where all the players inhabit the same body,

667
00:35:03,004 --> 00:35:04,987
how do we empower them to embrace each other

668
00:35:05,127 --> 00:35:06,329
and what scares them most?

669
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,753
The challenge is actually a really big one

670
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:11,597
because this is not a game about defeating the horror.

671
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:13,780
there is no defeating the horror.

672
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,342
This is a game about leaning into being scared,

673
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:18,644
being vulnerable, and trying to survive

674
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:19,885
when you have no power.

675
00:35:20,746 --> 00:35:23,168
So how do we accomplish this with the people

676
00:35:23,429 --> 00:35:25,250
of various genders sitting around the table,

677
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:27,933
some of whom are going to take to this like fish to water,

678
00:35:28,033 --> 00:35:30,896
and others who maybe have no lived experiences to access?

679
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,438
And most importantly, how do we make this fun?

680
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:37,722
So archetypes.

681
00:35:38,418 --> 00:35:40,499
And more importantly, complexes.

682
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,140
Because of my training, we were able to apply

683
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,901
a deep mastery of archetypes and Jungian psychology

684
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:49,763
to narrative design to get us to a place that works.

685
00:35:51,103 --> 00:35:52,644
Hopefully most of you are familiar with archetypes,

686
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:53,924
but I'll give you the rundown anyway.

687
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:56,605
Archetypes are personality patterns

688
00:35:56,825 --> 00:35:59,146
that our minds recognize almost universally.

689
00:35:59,847 --> 00:36:04,509
They're the composites, the pathways to understanding, loaded with an entire culture's

690
00:36:04,569 --> 00:36:07,371
interpretation and knowledge of a certain way of being.

691
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:11,153
Archetypes are recognizable roles in our social world.

692
00:36:11,593 --> 00:36:14,114
The mother, the sage, the lover, and so on.

693
00:36:15,035 --> 00:36:19,497
You should think of archetypes like a zip file your brain can read unconsciously.

694
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:25,193
Even if you specifically don't know what it means to be a mother, engaging with a mother

695
00:36:25,253 --> 00:36:29,556
archetype unfolds an understanding for you that is also relatable to everyone around

696
00:36:29,596 --> 00:36:29,776
you.

697
00:36:30,377 --> 00:36:36,241
In games, archetypes are a means of transferring vast quantities of information to players

698
00:36:36,722 --> 00:36:38,003
without overburdening them.

699
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,163
For Bluebeard's Bride, we used our expertise

700
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,005
to burrow down a layer deeper than simple archetypes.

701
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:51,468
Archetypes can also represent pieces of a single person.

702
00:36:52,229 --> 00:36:54,070
Within us all is an array of archetypes

703
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:56,292
of varying strengths and qualities.

704
00:36:57,893 --> 00:37:01,496
The archetypes themselves remain pure in root,

705
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:04,439
but there's layers of lived experiences

706
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:08,122
that kind of stick to them, kind of like gum on a shoe.

707
00:37:08,822 --> 00:37:10,764
And that's what a complex is.

708
00:37:11,724 --> 00:37:13,726
So on top of the mother archetype,

709
00:37:13,866 --> 00:37:15,527
you've got maybe the mother martyr,

710
00:37:16,488 --> 00:37:17,909
who is the mother who's like,

711
00:37:18,129 --> 00:37:19,810
I do everything for you, why don't you love me?

712
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,131
Some of you have experienced that.

713
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:24,315
Right?

714
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:30,497
And these complexes are kind of with you throughout your life for better or worse.

715
00:37:31,377 --> 00:37:33,618
They are inherently imperfect.

716
00:37:34,198 --> 00:37:38,619
If you've ever had an argument with yourself in your own head, think of it as your complexes

717
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:40,100
having a go at each other.

718
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:44,471
For Bluebeard's Bride, we picked some of the archetypes

719
00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:47,134
and attached complexes most relevant to women

720
00:37:47,654 --> 00:37:49,356
as the basis for each of our characters,

721
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:51,579
the mother, the virgin, the witch,

722
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,601
the femme fatale, and the animus.

723
00:37:56,523 --> 00:37:58,645
So let's take a brief look at Jung's structure of self,

724
00:37:58,665 --> 00:37:59,746
I know it looks really scary,

725
00:38:00,506 --> 00:38:02,568
as a helpful starting place for archetypal work.

726
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:05,630
This diagram is Jung's map of the psyche.

727
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:07,772
At the top is the outer world,

728
00:38:08,032 --> 00:38:10,454
our persona and ego are closest to the surface.

729
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,117
Then we move down and you see the shadow

730
00:38:13,197 --> 00:38:14,037
and the inner world.

731
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:15,899
Those are the unconscious

732
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:17,901
or only semi-conscious parts of ourselves.

733
00:38:18,441 --> 00:38:19,982
You'll notice that the self contains

734
00:38:20,183 --> 00:38:21,424
the whole of all of these things.

735
00:38:22,604 --> 00:38:23,885
In Bluebeard's Bride, the sisters

736
00:38:23,925 --> 00:38:26,646
have to fluidly navigate both the inner world of the bride's

737
00:38:26,686 --> 00:38:29,047
mind and the outer world of the castle.

738
00:38:29,687 --> 00:38:32,709
We specifically built mechanics into the game

739
00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:33,589
to accomplish this.

740
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:36,571
You can throw in as many paragraphs of exposition

741
00:38:36,631 --> 00:38:38,111
or dialogue as you want at a player,

742
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:40,453
but it won't stick unless a player has a way

743
00:38:40,513 --> 00:38:42,333
to engage or embody it directly.

744
00:38:44,262 --> 00:38:48,044
We built specific mechanics around bringing a sister to the forefront, the persona.

745
00:38:49,164 --> 00:38:52,746
This is the role that operates with and around the outer world.

746
00:38:53,326 --> 00:38:57,668
A sister gets to occupy the bride's persona and use an extra set of moves oriented towards

747
00:38:57,688 --> 00:38:58,268
the outer world.

748
00:38:58,928 --> 00:39:02,509
If she possesses a wedding ring that passes around the table,

749
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:05,110
only one sister can have the ring at a time.

750
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:08,671
So as an example, the virgin currently possesses the ring.

751
00:39:09,171 --> 00:39:11,632
So she's able to call on a castle servant for help.

752
00:39:12,212 --> 00:39:13,673
The interaction goes badly, though,

753
00:39:13,793 --> 00:39:15,833
as the servant tries to seduce the virgin.

754
00:39:16,373 --> 00:39:19,334
Overwhelmed, the virgin gives up the ring to the femme fatale,

755
00:39:19,934 --> 00:39:21,835
and she takes over while the virgin withdraws

756
00:39:21,895 --> 00:39:23,675
from the sticky mess that she got the bride into.

757
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:29,708
Likewise, there are mechanics built around sublimating a sister into the shadow, a place

758
00:39:29,728 --> 00:39:31,270
of exile deep within the psyche.

759
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:34,573
If a sister becomes too wounded, she shatters.

760
00:39:36,154 --> 00:39:41,740
In becoming a terrible, disoriented version of herself, she is no longer to make any of

761
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,881
the moves she could before.

762
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:47,025
She can only help the facilitator antagonize the other sisters until the end of the game.

763
00:39:47,045 --> 00:39:48,446
Which, by the way, is really fun.

764
00:39:52,281 --> 00:39:57,085
Again, giving players access to archetypes and complexes through our mechanics was key

765
00:39:57,105 --> 00:39:58,065
to making our game work.

766
00:39:58,966 --> 00:40:03,089
To get players to engage at the deep level of complexes, right, not just archetypes,

767
00:40:03,629 --> 00:40:06,632
we gave each sister three faces to choose from.

768
00:40:06,652 --> 00:40:12,276
So if we're thinking about it structurally, a sister is an archetype and the face is a

769
00:40:12,316 --> 00:40:12,716
complex.

770
00:40:13,774 --> 00:40:17,539
At the start of the game, each player chooses which sister to play, and then one face on

771
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:18,640
the sister's character sheet.

772
00:40:19,241 --> 00:40:22,966
The face is an extra move that they can use throughout the game to reinforce the theme

773
00:40:23,066 --> 00:40:23,727
of their complex.

774
00:40:24,843 --> 00:40:27,644
In the example we're looking at here, the mother has three faces.

775
00:40:28,105 --> 00:40:29,845
The bear, the kingmaker, and the martyr.

776
00:40:30,685 --> 00:40:34,947
Each has a specific flavor of the mother archetype, and each with its own hang-ups.

777
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,208
The bear protects one sister at the cost of injuring another.

778
00:40:38,628 --> 00:40:41,469
The kingmaker heals herself by giving her power over to men.

779
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,651
The martyr hurts herself double in return for healing another sister.

780
00:40:46,631 --> 00:40:51,535
So an example of this in play would be, a player has chosen the mother and decides to go with the martyr face.

781
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:56,598
During play, a horror sets itself upon the witch, about to enter her grievously.

782
00:40:57,279 --> 00:41:03,403
The mother steps in and uses the martyr move to protect the witch, but gets twice as hurt in return and shatters.

783
00:41:05,543 --> 00:41:07,483
Like a mother, she wanted to protect her own,

784
00:41:07,864 --> 00:41:09,984
but caustically and in an unsustainable way

785
00:41:10,024 --> 00:41:11,065
that wasn't even asked for.

786
00:41:11,825 --> 00:41:12,725
Now she's shattered.

787
00:41:13,105 --> 00:41:14,986
She's a pale, lost image of herself,

788
00:41:15,166 --> 00:41:16,847
forever wailing at the witch and the others

789
00:41:16,887 --> 00:41:18,407
that she was such a good mother.

790
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:20,168
She'd do anything for her babies.

791
00:41:20,248 --> 00:41:21,468
Why don't they appreciate her?

792
00:41:21,488 --> 00:41:23,909
We took pains to ensure that each face

793
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:26,230
was a recognizable extension of the archetype.

794
00:41:28,451 --> 00:41:28,971
To wrap up,

795
00:41:30,055 --> 00:41:33,036
We deployed archetypes and their accompanying complexes

796
00:41:33,496 --> 00:41:35,817
as character structures and play mechanics

797
00:41:36,238 --> 00:41:39,039
to evoke a specific experience, feminine horror.

798
00:41:39,779 --> 00:41:41,900
We used archetypes as shorthand to convey

799
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,861
to players complex character information

800
00:41:44,261 --> 00:41:45,562
and build pathways for players

801
00:41:45,622 --> 00:41:48,383
to more authentically occupy certain modes of being.

802
00:41:49,023 --> 00:41:51,584
This leads to a deep shared emotional experience

803
00:41:51,624 --> 00:41:53,945
for players that keeps them coming back for more.

804
00:41:54,986 --> 00:41:56,947
There are many ways you can adapt this approach

805
00:41:57,027 --> 00:41:57,707
to your own work.

806
00:41:58,939 --> 00:42:01,261
You can treat your ensemble cast

807
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:02,982
like an extension of your main character.

808
00:42:03,603 --> 00:42:06,305
Think of them as complexes turned outward.

809
00:42:06,746 --> 00:42:09,468
So again, going beyond the original archetype

810
00:42:09,669 --> 00:42:10,569
into a complex.

811
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,591
This will create a cohesive cast

812
00:42:12,611 --> 00:42:13,752
that balances out each other,

813
00:42:14,113 --> 00:42:15,174
spurs organic action,

814
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,216
and naturally draws out character growth

815
00:42:17,556 --> 00:42:18,437
over the course of the game.

816
00:42:19,678 --> 00:42:21,119
Bring an archetype or complex to life

817
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:23,021
by making it into an actual mechanic.

818
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:25,723
And build awareness for your main character

819
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:29,046
and how they're moving between their inner and outer worlds.

820
00:42:29,706 --> 00:42:30,707
How will that change gameplay?

821
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:33,489
And finally, explore what archetypes

822
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:36,972
and groupings of archetypes feel novel, new, and fresh.

823
00:42:37,532 --> 00:42:39,213
There's no reason to tread the same ground.

824
00:42:39,654 --> 00:42:41,395
You can make an innovative, cutting-edge game

825
00:42:41,435 --> 00:42:43,497
by exploring archetypes that have not historically

826
00:42:43,557 --> 00:42:45,498
been engaged with in games.

827
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:48,750

00:43:23,064 --> 00:43:23,385
Where...

853
00:43:23,706 --> 00:43:24,167
How do I do this?

854
00:43:24,448 --> 00:43:24,669
Here we go.

855
00:43:25,409 --> 00:43:27,350
Okay, so hello, my name is Dave Gilbert.

856
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,392
I am the founder, creative director at WowJedi Games.

857
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,052
We've been around since 2006

858
00:43:34,053 --> 00:43:38,635
and specialize in narrative-heavy adventure-type games.

859
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:41,416
We're known for Shiva, the Blackwell series,

860
00:43:41,456 --> 00:43:43,717
Gemini Ru, Primordia, Technobabylon, Shardlight,

861
00:43:44,177 --> 00:43:46,278
and others that I'm sure I'm forgetting offhand.

862
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:49,699
But today, I'm here to talk about Unavowed,

863
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:51,700
and for those of you who have not played it,

864
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,721
here is a quick trailer which isn't coming up.

865
00:43:55,162 --> 00:43:55,622
Just click it?

866
00:43:56,743 --> 00:43:57,103
There we go.

867
00:43:57,663 --> 00:43:59,164
These are dangerous times.

868
00:43:59,744 --> 00:44:01,065
Dark forces are coming.

869
00:44:02,266 --> 00:44:05,148
We are not dealing with a mindless spirit, bent on

870
00:44:05,248 --> 00:44:07,269
chaos and destruction.

871
00:44:07,309 --> 00:44:09,090
Time is closing in around us.

872
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:11,231
I can only hope we are not too late.

873
00:44:16,275 --> 00:44:19,937
We stand against chaos, sworn to protect the innocent from

874
00:44:19,997 --> 00:44:21,358
those who would do them harm.

875
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,642
We're a team. The wall against the darkness.

876
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:28,103
The protectors of the mundane world.

877
00:44:30,505 --> 00:44:34,527
Supernatural threats have risen, and for the first time in decades,

878
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,428
we need to fill our ranks to fight.

879
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:43,332
Use the skills of your chosen team members to help you defeat those who work in the shadows.

880
00:44:44,753 --> 00:44:48,115
I think your definition of impossible is about to change.

881
00:44:48,856 --> 00:44:50,837
Welcome to the Unavowed.

882
00:44:56,141 --> 00:44:56,702
Oh, thank you.

883
00:44:56,723 --> 00:44:57,344
Ha ha.

884
00:44:58,166 --> 00:44:58,407
Ah, no.

885
00:44:58,467 --> 00:44:58,968
Ah, no.

886
00:44:59,008 --> 00:44:59,369
Ah, no.

887
00:44:59,389 --> 00:44:59,510
Ah, no.

888
00:45:01,912 --> 00:45:07,054
So, the quick elevator pitch is that it's an urban fantasy adventure game with the narrative

889
00:45:07,094 --> 00:45:13,957
structure of a party-based RPG, which is a boring and unsexy way of saying that I'm basically

890
00:45:14,057 --> 00:45:18,079
cribbing the old Bioware style from the mid-2000s.

891
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:25,303
It's basically the old-style Bioware RPG narrative structure, but without the combat.

892
00:45:25,703 --> 00:45:28,344
You progress through the game via a series of missions.

893
00:45:28,958 --> 00:45:31,663
And for each mission, you have a pool of characters

894
00:45:32,064 --> 00:45:34,749
that can join you on your adventure.

895
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:37,294
And you can choose two of them at any time

896
00:45:37,374 --> 00:45:38,556
out of a pool of these four.

897
00:45:40,497 --> 00:45:42,918
So this gameplay mechanic will be familiar, obviously,

898
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:45,320
to anyone who played Nice to the Old Republic or Dragon Age

899
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:45,920
or Mass Effect.

900
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:49,922
But instead of changing your tactics in combat situations,

901
00:45:50,342 --> 00:45:52,083
they change how you solve puzzles

902
00:45:52,303 --> 00:45:55,224
and get through obstacles and problems in the game world.

903
00:45:55,884 --> 00:45:58,185
So the challenge here in creating this game

904
00:45:58,366 --> 00:45:59,146
was to keep.

905
00:45:59,326 --> 00:46:01,407
the focus entirely on these four characters.

906
00:46:01,827 --> 00:46:04,507
They were the draw, we needed to keep the focus on them.

907
00:46:05,308 --> 00:46:12,009
Every part of every mission needed to reinforce the relationship between you and them and

908
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:13,010
with each other.

909
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:19,832
And in order to do this, I really needed to have a very concrete understanding of who

910
00:46:19,852 --> 00:46:24,073
these characters were, and not just in terms of their backstory and things like that.

911
00:46:24,473 --> 00:46:29,334
but I needed to approach it from what I call a high and low level perspective.

912
00:46:30,494 --> 00:46:35,616
And by high level, I mean the overall feel, the feeling I want you to get from these characters,

913
00:46:35,976 --> 00:46:40,897
their personalities, their backstories, the filter that they see the world through.

914
00:46:42,238 --> 00:46:42,838
Why won't you go?

915
00:46:42,858 --> 00:46:44,878
Oh, I can use the arrow keys, awesome.

916
00:46:45,821 --> 00:46:47,142
This is Mondana, for example.

917
00:46:47,422 --> 00:46:50,244
She is a djinn swordswoman who is several centuries old.

918
00:46:50,784 --> 00:46:54,707
She sees the world through a filter of what used to be there.

919
00:46:55,507 --> 00:46:58,129
She will look at a street corner, this game takes place in New York,

920
00:46:58,589 --> 00:47:01,631
she'll look at a street corner and remember a tree she used to climb

921
00:47:01,711 --> 00:47:02,992
that was there 200 years ago,

922
00:47:03,412 --> 00:47:06,454
or what supernatural creatures existed that do not anymore.

923
00:47:07,315 --> 00:47:08,535
This guy, his name is Eli.

924
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:12,078
He is a mage who came into his power very late in life.

925
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,819
He had to leave his family and career behind.

926
00:47:14,939 --> 00:47:19,422
So he tends to look at the world through what he's lost and what he used to be.

927
00:47:20,863 --> 00:47:23,845
Logan is a spirit medium who can talk to ghosts.

928
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,066
He is a recovering addict.

929
00:47:26,686 --> 00:47:30,369
So he tends to look at the world through, he tends to look at everything in relation

930
00:47:30,429 --> 00:47:33,070
to how it can either help or hurt his recovery.

931
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:39,170
This is Vicky, she's a disgraced police officer from a large cop family, and she typically

932
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:42,131
divides the world into law abiders and criminals, very black and white.

933
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:48,172
So I'm obviously paraphrasing, there's more to these characters than that, but these are

934
00:47:48,192 --> 00:47:53,554
the broad experiences and points of views that each character brings to the various

935
00:47:53,634 --> 00:47:57,695
conversations and interactions that they have with you, various NPCs, and each other.

936
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:05,101
I wanted to make you feel like you were hanging out with friends and getting to know them.

937
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:08,324
And that's all well and good, but that's just a story.

938
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:12,449
So I needed to also approach it from a low-level perspective.

939
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,512
And by that, I mean the nitty-gritty details.

940
00:48:15,712 --> 00:48:19,897
What do these characters actually do from a gameplay perspective?

941
00:48:20,237 --> 00:48:24,421
How do they help you solve problems and help you progress through the game?

942
00:48:24,922 --> 00:48:29,846
I knew that every mission would play out slightly differently, depending on who you brought

943
00:48:29,886 --> 00:48:33,590
with you, and every character needed to bring something different to the table.

944
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:37,013
I really wanted each combination to be unique and interesting.

945
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:41,442
So Mandana here is the agile and athletic one

946
00:48:41,802 --> 00:48:44,645
who can climb to places that none of the other characters

947
00:48:44,705 --> 00:48:46,086
can, like this ledge.

948
00:48:46,586 --> 00:48:50,429
Eli can set stuff on fire and has the power

949
00:48:50,489 --> 00:48:53,751
to read or look at anything that was consumed by a flame.

950
00:48:54,692 --> 00:48:56,813
Vicky is a former cop, knows every police

951
00:48:56,873 --> 00:48:58,855
officer in the city, can get information

952
00:48:58,895 --> 00:49:00,776
she wouldn't get otherwise, or that you

953
00:49:00,816 --> 00:49:01,617
wouldn't get otherwise.

954
00:49:02,478 --> 00:49:05,422
And Logan, being a spirit medium, can talk to ghosts.

955
00:49:06,003 --> 00:49:07,705
So if you see a ghost in any scene,

956
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:09,308
he can talk to that ghost,

957
00:49:09,408 --> 00:49:11,330
and you can get more information that way.

958
00:49:11,891 --> 00:49:12,632
If you don't have Logan,

959
00:49:12,853 --> 00:49:14,174
the ghost just kind of wails at you.

960
00:49:16,021 --> 00:49:20,863
So my intent here was for these two tiers, the high and low

961
00:49:20,983 --> 00:49:22,703
level, to kind of work together in tandem

962
00:49:23,243 --> 00:49:26,624
to make every character combination unique and fun

963
00:49:26,644 --> 00:49:27,705
and interesting experience.

964
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:30,546
But at the same time, I wanted you

965
00:49:30,586 --> 00:49:33,507
to see the potential alternate paths

966
00:49:33,907 --> 00:49:34,947
that you could have taken.

967
00:49:36,327 --> 00:49:40,030
And if you didn't bring Vicky and you see a police officer, you might think, oh, you

968
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:43,774
know, if I brought Vicky, I could talk to that cop and things would play out a little

969
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:44,214
differently.

970
00:49:45,035 --> 00:49:47,317
And overall, I think I did a good job with this.

971
00:49:47,858 --> 00:49:53,003
Not every player loved every character, but there were no characters that were universally

972
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,625
loved by everyone or hated by everyone.

973
00:49:56,326 --> 00:50:00,470
And the game was very specifically designed so you can pick and choose your favorites.

974
00:50:02,323 --> 00:50:07,591
For example, if you see a high ledge and Mandana's not there, you might wonder if she could have gotten up there.

975
00:50:09,073 --> 00:50:14,381
The hope being that you'd want to replay the game and see what would happen if you took another character combination.

976
00:50:16,344 --> 00:50:16,905
Theoretically.

977
00:50:18,392 --> 00:50:23,594
What I did not expect was that the players, when the players saw a ghost and they did

978
00:50:23,614 --> 00:50:26,956
not have Logan, they got very frustrated and very annoyed.

979
00:50:27,756 --> 00:50:31,737
If they saw this ledge and didn't have Mondana, they didn't care so much.

980
00:50:31,897 --> 00:50:35,599
They knew that there were other paths, but they really wanted to talk to that ghost.

981
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:42,281
And so what ended up happening was they inevitably brought Logan with them on every mission thereafter.

982
00:50:43,241 --> 00:50:46,443
So he was the probably most chosen character of them all.

983
00:50:46,523 --> 00:50:46,663
So...

984
00:50:47,143 --> 00:50:48,084
You know, you're welcome, Logan.

985
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:51,766
So the main lesson that I learned from all this

986
00:50:52,407 --> 00:50:55,810
is that it's very important to have a high-level design goal.

987
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:59,612
Mine was that I wanted you to like these characters.

988
00:51:00,193 --> 00:51:03,896
So every low-level design decision I made

989
00:51:04,076 --> 00:51:06,638
was in support of that high-level goal.

990
00:51:07,418 --> 00:51:09,780
And without that, I would have been lost in the weeds.

991
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,882
This gave me the direction and focus

992
00:51:12,382 --> 00:51:15,425
that I really needed to get through this project

993
00:51:15,505 --> 00:51:16,085
and get it done.

994
00:51:16,766 --> 00:51:21,670
Otherwise I would have gotten very overwhelmed with all the alternate paths and everything.

995
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:26,013
So this really helped keep me focused, that high level goal of that, this is what I want

996
00:51:26,033 --> 00:51:29,156
the game to feel like and this is what I want people to get from it, so I'm going to focus

997
00:51:29,196 --> 00:51:29,616
on that.

998
00:51:30,017 --> 00:51:34,160
And whenever I was lost, I would just have to remember that and that would kind of steer

999
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,281
me back to where I needed to be.

1000
00:51:36,282 --> 00:51:38,002
Anyway, I'm going to close with a bit of a plug.

1001
00:51:38,022 --> 00:51:46,384
Unavowed has been nominated for an IGF award this year in the category of Excellence in

1002
00:51:46,424 --> 00:51:51,125
Narrative, so if you're interested in seeing more or playing a bit of the game, you can

1003
00:51:51,165 --> 00:51:54,186
check it out on the show floor later in the week.

1004
00:51:55,006 --> 00:51:55,687
Thank you very much.

1005
00:52:03,786 --> 00:52:07,268
All right, so we had quite a big variety of games.

1006
00:52:07,688 --> 00:52:10,790
I think that this might be the one session where you could hear about,

1007
00:52:12,050 --> 00:52:15,952
you know, Pocahontas and Jung, and you can see a Unity

1008
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:22,076
editor screen too. So now we're going to give you a few takeaways, you know, what

1009
00:52:22,096 --> 00:52:23,696
are the kinds of things that we've learned from

1010
00:52:23,937 --> 00:52:27,258
all these very, very varied games that we saw today?

1011
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:32,112
So the first one has to do with role-playing games,

1012
00:52:32,212 --> 00:52:34,474
kind of piggybacking on what Dave was just talking about.

1013
00:52:35,175 --> 00:52:38,597
Can we have role-playing game elements without combat?

1014
00:52:38,917 --> 00:52:41,359
Well, yeah, of course.

1015
00:52:43,501 --> 00:52:46,202
RPGs have many mechanics beyond fighting.

1016
00:52:46,323 --> 00:52:48,744
We can create and maintain relationships.

1017
00:52:49,225 --> 00:52:50,826
We can have morality systems.

1018
00:52:50,986 --> 00:52:52,527
We have resource management.

1019
00:52:52,867 --> 00:52:55,389
We have character growth, just to name a few.

1020
00:52:56,830 --> 00:52:59,492
Stats can also be used in expressive ways

1021
00:53:00,332 --> 00:53:02,853
beyond how strong or dexterous your character is.

1022
00:53:03,674 --> 00:53:06,796
We can also use stats to keep track of how the player

1023
00:53:06,836 --> 00:53:09,277
relates with other characters in the world of our game.

1024
00:53:10,998 --> 00:53:13,360
There's a great wealth of human, dramatic,

1025
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,221
and emotional mechanics players are already familiar with

1026
00:53:16,341 --> 00:53:17,702
through RPGs.

1027
00:53:18,523 --> 00:53:20,604
There are many different ways in which to interact

1028
00:53:20,624 --> 00:53:23,045
with the world beyond attacking it, destroying it,

1029
00:53:23,085 --> 00:53:24,026
and trying to prevail.

1030
00:53:26,351 --> 00:53:29,634
And it's important to remember that even the smallest things are storytelling.

1031
00:53:29,694 --> 00:53:34,498
So the simplest classic mechanics can be leveraged for any kind of story you want to tell.

1032
00:53:34,638 --> 00:53:38,062
Re-contextualizing everyday mechanics can be incredibly meaningful.

1033
00:53:38,542 --> 00:53:43,146
So the simple act of moving a character up and down in a platformer can be a rich metaphor

1034
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:44,747
that dramatizes emotional experience.

1035
00:53:45,308 --> 00:53:49,091
An action as simple as lying to someone can have staggering impact, casual conversations

1036
00:53:49,111 --> 00:53:49,852
between NPCs.

1037
00:53:50,252 --> 00:53:51,493
can help you get to know them better

1038
00:53:51,893 --> 00:53:53,913
and know how they'll behave in certain situations.

1039
00:53:54,614 --> 00:53:56,034
If you use your tools cleverly,

1040
00:53:56,054 --> 00:54:01,336
it can have the same epic consequence of a boss fight,

1041
00:54:02,076 --> 00:54:03,556
but for a cheaper dev cost.

1042
00:54:07,137 --> 00:54:08,618
Also, do your homework.

1043
00:54:09,738 --> 00:54:11,079
Just because we are familiar

1044
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,959
with basic strategies of storytelling

1045
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,740
doesn't make us into experts

1046
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,240
on every single topic out there.

1047
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:24,381
And just going to the Wikipedia article is not research, just you know, the world is big on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is pretty cool,

1048
00:54:24,461 --> 00:54:30,063
but that's only the starting point. So, you know, do things like going to a library. They exist.

1049
00:54:30,423 --> 00:54:35,464
They're there in the world. If you're writing about a place and you can afford it, try to visit it.

1050
00:54:35,684 --> 00:54:36,985
You know, meet the people there.

1051
00:54:38,225 --> 00:54:43,367
If you are writing about a culture, talk to people belonging to that culture directly.

1052
00:54:44,207 --> 00:54:45,267
That's good to ask.

1053
00:54:45,507 --> 00:54:49,649
Or hire them as consultants if you can afford it, or even writers, please.

1054
00:54:50,249 --> 00:54:52,069
That's how we bring diversity into games.

1055
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:59,472
Carelessly applied story elements, especially those that are drawn from deep cultural traditions,

1056
00:55:00,052 --> 00:55:05,914
can make your game boring and derivative at best, and toxic and stereotypical at worst.

1057
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:10,893
And of course, embrace being a smuggler.

1058
00:55:11,453 --> 00:55:15,314
So audiences will be open to new things if you're willing to meet them halfway, but that

1059
00:55:15,434 --> 00:55:18,735
doesn't mean you have to compromise your values.

1060
00:55:19,155 --> 00:55:23,537
So using humor to disarm people and endear them can strengthen, not undercut the subject

1061
00:55:23,557 --> 00:55:28,659
matter of your story, because in addition to sort of getting people on board, it also

1062
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:30,960
makes characters feel more human and real.

1063
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:36,484
And resorting to the conventions of genres like urban fantasy or platformers can help us connect with audiences

1064
00:55:36,804 --> 00:55:40,888
but also give them tough decisions to make and intimate stories that touch them.

1065
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:47,954
And that's all on our part. Thank you very much for coming. We're not going to have Q&A,

1066
00:55:47,994 --> 00:55:49,115
we don't have enough time,

1067
00:55:49,195 --> 00:55:53,219
but we'll all meet you at the rapid room down the hall if you have any questions

1068
00:55:53,279 --> 00:55:56,922
and you want to follow up with any of the speakers or ourselves. Thanks again!
