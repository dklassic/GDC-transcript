1
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:06,774
All right.

2
00:00:07,554 --> 00:00:08,755
Welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:11,737
I hope you had a good show so far.

4
00:00:13,338 --> 00:00:14,919
Just a couple of standard reminders.

5
00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:17,481
Remember to fill out the evaluation that

6
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:19,102
gets sent to you after this, because I'm

7
00:00:19,142 --> 00:00:20,142
going for that high score.

8
00:00:21,223 --> 00:00:23,284
And also turn down the volume on your phones.

9
00:00:25,085 --> 00:00:27,907
But I am Sveit Kervall.

10
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,169
You can pronounce that any way you want.

11
00:00:31,049 --> 00:00:33,211
I come from Reykjavik, Iceland, born and raised.

12
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:34,492
And I've.

13
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:37,611
Been working for CCP, an independent gaming publisher,

14
00:00:38,111 --> 00:00:39,312
for the last 13 years.

15
00:00:39,352 --> 00:00:41,573
Started in customer support, and now I'm

16
00:00:41,693 --> 00:00:43,254
a lead community developer.

17
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:49,298
So the community business has been around for almost as long

18
00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:50,198
as gaming, not quite.

19
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:52,640
It, of course, came along with the internet,

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,342
and it's changed a lot in the last few years

21
00:00:56,402 --> 00:01:00,364
or so with the advent of powerful community content

22
00:01:00,384 --> 00:01:02,846
creators in the community, and social media, obviously.

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,641
Community people used to often be back in the days like volunteers, used to work from home.

24
00:01:09,162 --> 00:01:13,963
Then they got on boarded but were often stored behind those boxes of last year's t-shirts

25
00:01:14,063 --> 00:01:15,764
and weren't given much thought to.

26
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:22,286
But the job has grown and there's still, I believe, in the business a lot of possibilities for community people to grow professionally.

27
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:26,557
So community teams have become a bigger asset and it's very important.

28
00:01:26,857 --> 00:01:33,424
We at CCP believe that it's important to allow community people to grow and take on bigger challenges.

29
00:01:33,444 --> 00:01:36,847
And to do that you sometimes have to prioritize and look at how you do things.

30
00:01:38,568 --> 00:01:43,413
Rowing is fun and it builds a strong back, but it's hard and sails just get you further.

31
00:01:43,513 --> 00:01:47,176
Plus you can do other things along the way like that gentleman with the book.

32
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:54,460
So a bit of background just so you understand some of the things that I'm talking about

33
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,540
and why they have worked for us.

34
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,842
I come from another world, a world of 7,500 unique solar systems that you can explore

35
00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:10,223
and conquer, a world of boundless freedom, self-reliance, cooperation, commerce, conflict.

36
00:02:11,204 --> 00:02:15,865
It's a very interesting world and it's inhabited by hundreds of thousands of space experts.

37
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:18,985
This is a world where only the strong survive.

38
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:26,164
I am, of course, talking about EVE Online, the infamous space sci-fi MMO that's been

39
00:02:26,205 --> 00:02:29,492
around for 13 years and it's been in constant development.

40
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:34,468
And just to sum up the three things that I think make EVE unique,

41
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:38,713
it's that it has this single shard design, or there's no shards,

42
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:42,317
it's just a single universe where no matter where you are in the world,

43
00:02:42,357 --> 00:02:43,518
you enter one world.

44
00:02:43,918 --> 00:02:47,903
And it has time zones and all kinds of nationalities and cultures and stuff like that.

45
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:49,585
So it's very interesting like that.

46
00:02:50,831 --> 00:02:56,194
It has player-controlled manufacturing and industry, which means that almost everything in the game that you need, whether it's weapons,

47
00:02:56,854 --> 00:02:58,936
modules, or ships, or ammo,

48
00:02:59,316 --> 00:03:03,678
it's all made by players from raw materials harvested by yourself or other players.

49
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:08,941
And then all these things are moved around and traded on a very robust market that follows the laws of supply and demand.

50
00:03:08,961 --> 00:03:10,422
So there's a lot of

51
00:03:11,222 --> 00:03:11,962
cool things you can do.

52
00:03:13,262 --> 00:03:18,187
And of course, speaking of cool things you can do, there is very much freedom in the game.

53
00:03:18,207 --> 00:03:22,331
There's few rules, no hand-holding, and you are thrown into this merciless universe

54
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:26,696
where you have to band up with other people to survive and do big things.

55
00:03:29,115 --> 00:03:33,838
EVE is not an easy game. It's a game where something like this happens and where people

56
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:38,101
actually can look at this picture and tell you what's happening in much detail. I'm not

57
00:03:38,161 --> 00:03:42,364
one of those people, but I can tell you some broad context stuff. This is from the biggest

58
00:03:42,444 --> 00:03:48,349
battle we've ever had on the server. It was fought by over 8,000 people over the course

59
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:50,831
of 21 hours, destroying something like $300,000 in assets.

60
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,932
It was long enough so people could go to sleep and go to work and then come back and it was still going.

61
00:04:00,392 --> 00:04:03,654
Pretty cool stuff. And there's people that organize the armies that go into these battles.

62
00:04:03,714 --> 00:04:09,636
They set up the fleets with the right weapons and right compositions, organize logistics, reinforcements.

63
00:04:09,936 --> 00:04:13,657
Then you have the generals that plan longer term campaigns, politicians, diplomats,

64
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:17,299
who are planning conquests and wars and making peace with these guys and these guys

65
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,720
so you can make war on the other guys. It's very, very, very interesting.

66
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,606
We have some fairly smart and dedicated people in the community as a result of all this freedom of enterprise.

67
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:32,650
So the EVE Online community, it is a relatively mature community.

68
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,112
It has a wide age span.

69
00:04:35,132 --> 00:04:43,579
We have like young teenagers up to very old pensioners, but the average age is around 31, which is higher than many games.

70
00:04:46,194 --> 00:04:49,215
Around 40% have some sort of an IT background.

71
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:50,596
It's a fairly educated community,

72
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:54,678
and a lot of technological backgrounds in the community,

73
00:04:54,718 --> 00:04:55,779
according to surveys we've run.

74
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,040
So we have a lot of people that like to solve

75
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,981
complicated problems and are very good at it.

76
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:03,363
So, odds are that the person fixing your computer at work

77
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:04,323
is an Eve player.

78
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:05,844
So, be nice to them.

79
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:12,171
We have players from all nations almost colluding or colliding.

80
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:19,516
It's a very interesting environment because, like I said, with the time zones, you have to have friends in every time zone to cover your assets,

81
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:22,118
and you have to attack your enemies strategically.

82
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:27,022
You get some nationalities, like they play together because they speak a common language.

83
00:05:27,282 --> 00:05:34,488
There's all sorts of dynamics that are very interesting when you don't shard up your community and divide them by what they have in common.

84
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:42,493
But community teams are, you know, we know the story.

85
00:05:42,613 --> 00:05:43,974
Being on a community team is really hard.

86
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:44,794
There's so much to do.

87
00:05:44,814 --> 00:05:46,795
You have to keep track of so many things.

88
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:50,017
It's like you have the world's weight on your shoulder.

89
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,219
I was like 6' 5' before I started this job.

90
00:05:55,827 --> 00:05:58,628
But, I mean, there's a wide focus to take care of.

91
00:05:58,648 --> 00:06:00,429
You have to know what everyone in the community is doing,

92
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:02,129
you have to know what everybody in the company is doing,

93
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:05,050
and you have to make sure that the communication is flawless

94
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:09,271
and effortless and productive between those groups.

95
00:06:09,311 --> 00:06:11,492
And, I mean, we can call ourselves, like, bouncers,

96
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:14,853
gardeners, herders of cats, reporters, shrinks, whatever.

97
00:06:14,953 --> 00:06:19,114
But the thing is that we have only a limited time.

98
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:22,211
And we have to take care of how we use it.

99
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:27,315
And I believe in sharing the load of doing all the things

100
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:29,596
that need to be done with the community

101
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:31,438
and with the rest of the company as possible.

102
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,019
Kind of harnessing the wind, if you will.

103
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:38,223
So if we take a look at the EVE Online community team,

104
00:06:38,623 --> 00:06:40,744
we have an in-house team of seven people

105
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:41,905
that take care of EVE Online.

106
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:44,807
The broad scope is communication, localization,

107
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:45,708
community support.

108
00:06:45,748 --> 00:06:48,530
That involves all project events and all kinds of things

109
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,991
that go on.

110
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:49,211
So.

111
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:54,756
We call ourselves community developers, and we come from all over the place.

112
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,187
And I want to start by introducing you to Thomas Meissen.

113
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:04,575
As you can tell, he takes care of the German community

114
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:05,876
and moved from Germany to work with us.

115
00:07:05,896 --> 00:07:08,158
And as you can tell from his stern gaze,

116
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:12,121
he is called the Eisenfaust, which

117
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,202
means the iron fist in German.

118
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:18,986
And that's because he takes care of our army of volunteers.

119
00:07:19,026 --> 00:07:22,549
So he has a multiplier on himself, essentially.

120
00:07:24,045 --> 00:07:25,926
We have volunteers that do a lot of cool things for us.

121
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,408
They call themselves the Interstellar Service Department

122
00:07:29,488 --> 00:07:30,949
and it's a team of around 100 people.

123
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:34,091
And I'm going to talk a little bit about the three top teams.

124
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:40,075
Star is a team that helps people in-game, runs in-game channels,

125
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:43,958
they moderate, they make sure everybody's behaving, and they help people.

126
00:07:44,518 --> 00:07:46,499
One thing they do that's really cool is meet and greets.

127
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,762
We give them actual sheets with the names of players that have joined in the last...

128
00:07:51,402 --> 00:07:53,223
A few weeks, last couple of weeks.

129
00:07:53,663 --> 00:07:58,005
And they go talk to them and we see that the retention rate for people that are contacted

130
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:03,708
and given resources and help and someone to go to if they need help is much higher.

131
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:07,029
It's like dozens of percent on average.

132
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:12,091
It's a huge increase in retention because EVE is a complicated game and people need some help and guidance.

133
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:16,173
Then we have the Bug Hunter team which is loved by our QA people because they

134
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:19,400
Help filter out early bug reports, do a lot of testing.

135
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:26,662
They are trusted with some limited dev roles and have access to closed test servers so they can do testing and early filtering.

136
00:08:26,702 --> 00:08:31,023
And they do a lot of good work for us and many of them have been around for a long time and are very smart people.

137
00:08:32,564 --> 00:08:37,125
And we have the forum moderator crew, which is my favorite because I don't like moderating forums.

138
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:40,126
I'd like to be away from that if I can.

139
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:49,102
They have some limited roles, they can't ban people, but they can do all other moderation and they can escalate difficult issues to us.

140
00:08:49,723 --> 00:08:54,047
And we back them up as we can. But this relieves us of a lot of work.

141
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:01,255
And the way this is set up, because we have only one person managing all these people internally.

142
00:09:02,215 --> 00:09:05,978
Although they do talk to other developers and stuff, it's like one person is responsible for the whole thing.

143
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,239
So we need some structure.

144
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,542
The Space Army has a ranking system.

145
00:09:10,562 --> 00:09:14,145
You enter as an Ensign, you become a Lieutenant, and you can work your way up the ranks

146
00:09:14,225 --> 00:09:19,890
and get increasing responsibility and access to all sorts of training and cool stuff.

147
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:25,649
We aim to make this team as self-reliant as possible, but no more than that.

148
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:27,310
There has to be access to developers.

149
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,932
We deal primarily with the top people in the organization,

150
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:33,893
and they then filter down knowledge and instructions to the rest of them.

151
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:39,115
Each brand is led by a vice-admiral, which is typically someone who's been with us for many years

152
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:41,656
and is very trusted and very smart.

153
00:09:43,173 --> 00:09:52,242
The point of the system, I mean, it has to be self-reliant if it's supposed to work as a team that takes the burden off us, so we don't have to mind it continuously.

154
00:09:54,184 --> 00:10:02,412
The code of conduct that they abide by is a modified version of the one that CCP staff have, so they're held to a fairly high standard and they live up to it amazingly.

155
00:10:04,802 --> 00:10:13,145
They do a lot of stuff for us, and we in turn, you know, we give them opportunities and an outlet for doing cool things that they like to do.

156
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:20,027
Just to give you an idea of how much work they do for us, it's 1,200 hours volunteered per month.

157
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:23,488
This is like a rough number from last year's averages.

158
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:32,671
200 hours of forum moderation alone, so you can imagine how much time that just relieves from like a team of seven that's in-house that can then focus on different things.

159
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,632
And it relieves itself like 90% of the daily moderation,

160
00:10:37,072 --> 00:10:38,113
which is very good.

161
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:41,115
So we have more time for that professional growth I talked

162
00:10:41,155 --> 00:10:44,277
about, more impactful projects that have to be done in-house.

163
00:10:44,837 --> 00:10:46,118
All of this is important, but it doesn't

164
00:10:46,238 --> 00:10:47,079
have to be done in-house.

165
00:10:49,937 --> 00:10:51,377
So there's a lot of benefits of this.

166
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:52,698
I mean, obviously, it is time saved.

167
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:55,418
But also, the fact, what I believe,

168
00:10:55,498 --> 00:10:57,179
is that your in-house team that has

169
00:10:57,219 --> 00:11:00,159
to work with the community on a lot of positive things,

170
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:05,740
building things, has to spend less time in an environment

171
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,181
where they focus a lot of time on the negative 2%

172
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:10,901
to try to create problems on the forum, bend the rules.

173
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:15,602
Editing bad words on a forum is not the most entertaining thing

174
00:11:15,622 --> 00:11:15,982
you can do.

175
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:17,822
So it puts us in a more positive.

176
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:26,405
And then you've got to think, like, why do people want to volunteer for EVE Online?

177
00:11:26,445 --> 00:11:29,686
I mean, why do they take time out of their day to do this?

178
00:11:31,307 --> 00:11:34,508
These are people that are above average interested in EVE Online.

179
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:38,670
They're absolutely enthusiastic about it and love it, and they are very good at it,

180
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,090
and they like to help other people.

181
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,606
The program attracts people that just selflessly help people in real life.

182
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:48,569
I mean, these are people that would help an old lady across the street,

183
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:54,657
or upload one of those mysteriously appearing torrents that none of us have ever downloaded, all that stuff.

184
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,523
People that just do things because they can and they want to do something for other people.

185
00:12:00,624 --> 00:12:05,106
And of course it's fun to be close to the company that's making the thing that you love.

186
00:12:05,146 --> 00:12:10,289
If you've been involved with EVE Online for a long time, it's fun to be close and see what's happening.

187
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:14,631
They sign an NDA, they sometimes get advanced information and stuff like that.

188
00:12:14,671 --> 00:12:15,391
So it's good.

189
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:21,195
And we do actually hire quite a lot of people from the pool of ISD because we get to know them and see what they can do.

190
00:12:21,295 --> 00:12:23,336
And they become trusted persons.

191
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:29,369
And we don't want people to join because of that, because we don't want them to focus on the job at hand,

192
00:12:29,469 --> 00:12:36,215
but it happens quite a lot. And actually four people on the community team now are former ISD, which is amazing.

193
00:12:38,012 --> 00:12:39,712
There's perks and prestige, of course.

194
00:12:40,453 --> 00:12:42,193
There's free accounts, they play for free, obviously.

195
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:43,854
They get tickets to official events.

196
00:12:44,994 --> 00:12:48,375
Store credit for every hour put in, so their hours are tracked,

197
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,857
so they earn store credit and then they can redeem that for merchandise from the EVE store.

198
00:12:52,477 --> 00:12:55,378
Or, if they just hang on to it long enough and put in enough hours,

199
00:12:55,718 --> 00:13:01,500
will actually just redeem their credits for a flight to Iceland for FanFest

200
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,281
and a stay in a hotel and everything.

201
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:05,221
So they can have a free trip to Iceland if they...

202
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:07,884
Hang on to the credits for long enough.

203
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:12,428
And then of course the color text and banners and identification, which is cool.

204
00:13:14,631 --> 00:13:18,334
It's not hard to find these people. These are people that keep track of what we say.

205
00:13:19,356 --> 00:13:20,617
You know, social media, all that stuff.

206
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:22,439
So we just put the word out that we need people.

207
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:27,925
And it's actually very, very easy for us to find people, which is a great luxury problem to have.

208
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:37,328
There's screening that they have to pass both by CCP staff and ISD captains and vice-admirals.

209
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:41,271
They must be in good standing, of course, not to have broken the rules too much.

210
00:13:42,773 --> 00:13:47,376
And they must know a lot about the game and they must have the right attitude, which is incredibly important.

211
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:53,821
The ISD are especially good themselves when they do their screening of filtering out people that have, you know,

212
00:13:53,881 --> 00:13:57,724
maybe they hunker too much for the power of moderation and all that stuff.

213
00:13:58,773 --> 00:13:59,353
That's important.

214
00:14:00,694 --> 00:14:02,634
And some of the current ones have been volunteers

215
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:05,855
for over 10 years and we see them at FanFest every year

216
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:07,876
and they're absolutely great people.

217
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:08,516
We love them a lot.

218
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:12,198
So here's just an example of how 2015 went.

219
00:14:13,158 --> 00:14:16,159
We let in about 10% of the people that applied.

220
00:14:16,539 --> 00:14:18,820
So it's a very hard system to get into.

221
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,781
And fewer people resigned than were accepted.

222
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:24,462
So we're dealing with low churn and a big pool

223
00:14:24,482 --> 00:14:26,143
of very, very competent applicants

224
00:14:26,183 --> 00:14:28,303
that we're very happy to have.

225
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:33,902
So what are the pitfalls of allowing players to do something like this for you?

226
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:38,607
I mean, obviously things can go wrong, and we've had our problems in the past.

227
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:44,092
We had, for example, we had a forum moderation team set up back in the day.

228
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:45,954
It wasn't terrible, it was great, they did a lot of good stuff.

229
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:49,317
From the early days of EVE Online, and it was discontinued in 2008.

230
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:53,367
But back then, we didn't have the same amount of experience

231
00:14:53,407 --> 00:14:55,047
in dealing with this.

232
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:56,547
We didn't have the proper structures.

233
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:57,908
We gave them too much power.

234
00:14:57,928 --> 00:15:00,068
We allowed them to ban people in forums, et cetera.

235
00:15:00,428 --> 00:15:01,949
That showed a lot of mistrust.

236
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:05,610
And there was drama around it, and more perceived problems

237
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,350
than actual problems.

238
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:08,370
But it ended up that we discontinued it,

239
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,550
moved moderation in-house.

240
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,471
And then the new system was taken up in 2011.

241
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:16,032
And it's gone since then.

242
00:15:16,052 --> 00:15:19,073
So since the olden days, it's been a learning experience.

243
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:26,134
And I mean, if it didn't have these volunteers, we'd either just need to add a bunch of staff to do all these things,

244
00:15:26,474 --> 00:15:30,455
or we'd probably just do fewer cool projects than we are currently doing,

245
00:15:30,976 --> 00:15:34,477
and we'd be focused more on like all kinds of menial tasks and management of them.

246
00:15:35,597 --> 00:15:41,840
So the bottom line is that they make us better, but we in turn, I mean, we give them opportunities to do something that they love

247
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,301
and get more engaged with a game that they love to play.

248
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:48,783
Then I want to...

249
00:15:50,088 --> 00:15:54,791
I want to tell you about Ben Gruber, who moved to Iceland from Australia to work with us.

250
00:15:55,552 --> 00:15:57,633
He manages the fansites program.

251
00:15:58,174 --> 00:16:05,379
Lots of companies have a fansite program of some sort, or at least list fansites on their page.

252
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,242
But for us, they're incredibly important.

253
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:12,524
We have all kinds of fansites that we try to divvy up,

254
00:16:13,245 --> 00:16:17,728
tools that players absolutely need, all kinds of guides and things that people couldn't be without.

255
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:19,329
Because...

256
00:16:21,267 --> 00:16:30,110
For EVE, they are just unusually important because the scope of the EVE universe, the depth, the complexity is such that we can never tend to everybody's needs.

257
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:36,893
It's just impossible. We don't have the resources or even the imagination to fill all these gaps that players just find for themselves.

258
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:42,475
So there's a lot of players doing absolutely essential things for us and for the community.

259
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:46,384
And so we try to divide them into these categories.

260
00:16:46,764 --> 00:16:49,766
And there's certain standards set for each category.

261
00:16:49,806 --> 00:16:51,727
I mean, blocks have to be updated regularly.

262
00:16:51,767 --> 00:16:53,488
Tools have to be functional and up to date.

263
00:16:53,908 --> 00:16:56,790
Guides have to be taking game changes into account

264
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,350
and all that stuff.

265
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:59,191
Then we do a biannual audit.

266
00:16:59,411 --> 00:17:03,593
And if you don't get in, or if your membership gets discontinued,

267
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:06,375
we contact them and tell them why and how they can get in again.

268
00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:10,016
Try to keep an active encouragement going there.

269
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:14,329
So finding these fansites is fairly easy.

270
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,430
Again, these are people that keep tabs on what we say,

271
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,550
so social media, all that stuff.

272
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,130
Then the benefit is that once we've

273
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,031
collected them into a pool of fansites,

274
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:24,952
we can send the fansite blasts with information

275
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:27,492
to these people that are experts at getting to our players.

276
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,693
But to find them, we maintain a formal application process.

277
00:17:32,113 --> 00:17:33,373
There's a form that people fill out.

278
00:17:34,174 --> 00:17:36,454
And of course, we just look for cool sites

279
00:17:36,494 --> 00:17:38,135
and we wave that form in their face

280
00:17:38,175 --> 00:17:39,415
if we think they should join the program.

281
00:17:41,924 --> 00:17:46,646
But what are the added benefits for someone who just likes to make websites to be in a program like this?

282
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:53,976
I mean there's perks, there's similar perks to what the ISD get, there's free tickets to official events, free accounts, etc.

283
00:17:54,396 --> 00:18:00,261
They don't get store credit for hours put in like the ISD because that's a lot harder to measure,

284
00:18:00,281 --> 00:18:06,846
but in turn we're pretty liberal with allowing fan sites to monetize with all kinds of ad programs, monetization programs,

285
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:12,150
so we encourage that and we want people to make a little extra on it if they can.

286
00:18:14,315 --> 00:18:16,395
Of course there's easier access to devs.

287
00:18:16,455 --> 00:18:23,397
I mean, some of our web developers in the community have sat down with our own web experts

288
00:18:23,457 --> 00:18:25,458
and gotten some help on some projects.

289
00:18:25,518 --> 00:18:29,539
We do roundtables and they can come to us and work with us on all kinds of projects.

290
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:31,399
So street cred matters.

291
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,400
And for access to the community, if they're a trusted fan site,

292
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,761
we know they're good for it and we'll help them more than someone else maybe who has an idea.

293
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:42,162
So it's good. Good to be close.

294
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,223
I mean, this is... most of the time people don't do it for any of this.

295
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:49,806
They do it because they have a great idea and they're good at something

296
00:18:49,826 --> 00:18:51,507
and they want to do something for the community

297
00:18:51,527 --> 00:18:54,270
and they want to, you know, get the status that comes with it and all that stuff.

298
00:18:55,211 --> 00:18:57,413
But the recognition from us is a nice bonus

299
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:59,875
and I think it's very important to do it even though people don't.

300
00:19:01,244 --> 00:19:08,750
Come just for that. This, of course, strengthens our relationship with these best developers,

301
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:15,096
these third-party developers in the community. We know who they are, we get attuned to what

302
00:19:15,116 --> 00:19:18,259
they can do, and we build this relationship that has a lot of benefits.

303
00:19:20,023 --> 00:19:26,734
And then of course, having an official list like this that's audited regularly and officially approved with clear guidelines,

304
00:19:27,455 --> 00:19:34,966
it gives helpful players, IST, ourselves, something to point to that's safe and quick and helps players along.

305
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:40,536
And very important again, this whole program with all its

306
00:19:40,576 --> 00:19:42,839
benefits is just part-time work for one man.

307
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:44,220
I mean, it's not even a majority thing.

308
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,783
It's just like a few hours a week to run it, basically, at

309
00:19:46,823 --> 00:19:48,104
this point.

310
00:19:48,224 --> 00:19:50,166
It takes a lot of work to set up, but it's not

311
00:19:50,807 --> 00:19:51,788
energy-intense to run.

312
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,033
So I want to give you an example.

313
00:19:58,033 --> 00:19:59,454
of one of my favorite websites.

314
00:19:59,794 --> 00:20:02,116
And this is like a good example of how EVE, the universe,

315
00:20:02,296 --> 00:20:04,798
and EVE, the software, don't always see eye to eye.

316
00:20:05,178 --> 00:20:08,300
See, we created a map so people could see the universe

317
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,162
and get some details, but it just didn't really fulfill

318
00:20:12,202 --> 00:20:14,764
the needs that players figured out for themselves.

319
00:20:14,824 --> 00:20:17,065
They needed certain things to plan very granularly,

320
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,626
all kinds of complex operations,

321
00:20:19,007 --> 00:20:20,688
explorations, wars, fleet movements.

322
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:26,665
Along came a German web developer, a player who calls himself Volari in-game,

323
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:31,107
and he made Dotland Maps, which is a web-based service that is absolutely fantastic.

324
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:37,170
And I want to play a little bit of where one of our better video makers called Johnny Pugh

325
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:40,852
tells us what the difference between our map and Dotland Maps.

326
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:43,874
This looks confusing to me. This is chaos.

327
00:20:44,574 --> 00:20:47,635
But if you want to make yourself an easier time of...

328
00:20:48,885 --> 00:20:54,909
Navigating through a particular region in EVE Online, do not use this EVE map tool.

329
00:20:55,849 --> 00:20:59,632
Now, I do understand if you just want to use the EVE client, but you don't have to do that.

330
00:20:59,672 --> 00:21:01,733
You can use the in-game EVE browser.

331
00:21:02,665 --> 00:21:02,745
I

332
00:21:02,786 --> 00:21:08,090
would never have been able to cover as a single pilot scouting around in a single ship.

333
00:21:26,422 --> 00:21:27,543
So it's not all flattering.

334
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:30,204
You know, he said some things about our map,

335
00:21:30,264 --> 00:21:30,964
but I forgive him.

336
00:21:31,084 --> 00:21:32,304
He's done so many good things.

337
00:21:32,645 --> 00:21:34,945
But this is a really cool butterfly effect story here,

338
00:21:35,005 --> 00:21:37,526
because we offer API support so players

339
00:21:37,566 --> 00:21:41,008
can build these tools from using data from our database.

340
00:21:41,688 --> 00:21:44,149
And a player comes along and makes something

341
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,390
in a game that's all built around traveling around space,

342
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,971
and he builds a tool that absolutely everyone uses

343
00:21:50,031 --> 00:21:50,831
at some point or another.

344
00:21:51,712 --> 00:22:00,038
It becomes very valuable. In turn, he obviously has a lot of server costs, so we help him advertise when he's collecting money from the community for his server costs.

345
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:07,204
And that's always gone really well, and we point people in his direction all the time, so he builds a bigger fan base and has many benefactors in the community.

346
00:22:07,224 --> 00:22:09,345
Then someone, a video maker like Johnny Pugh comes along.

347
00:22:10,222 --> 00:22:12,625
Starts exploring the universe, making regular video about it,

348
00:22:13,886 --> 00:22:15,868
educating people on his YouTube channel,

349
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:19,251
and entertains and educates thousands of people every week.

350
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:23,536
So that's, to me, an example of raising the sale pretty firmly

351
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:24,697
with assistance from the community.

352
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:29,702
And without all these fan sites, all these tools I've talked

353
00:22:29,722 --> 00:22:33,145
about, we just have fewer useful tools, way less content.

354
00:22:33,834 --> 00:22:36,937
Or we just have to hire a bunch of people to make things.

355
00:22:36,997 --> 00:22:40,561
But realistically, we'd probably just be a little bit crippled in some areas,

356
00:22:40,862 --> 00:22:42,664
because it's very hard to fill all those gaps.

357
00:22:45,485 --> 00:22:50,009
So recognizing people, even when they come not for that,

358
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:53,392
is very important because the person that doesn't come

359
00:22:53,412 --> 00:22:55,633
for the recognition may still leave for the lack of it

360
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,995
after a certain amount of time.

361
00:22:57,035 --> 00:22:59,517
People get tired, they burn out,

362
00:22:59,597 --> 00:23:01,519
and if they feel they're not being listened to

363
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:02,119
or appreciated.

364
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,323
So we have to contribute and do what we can for them.

365
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,702
Then not everything fits into a mold or an application form,

366
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:17,566
and we work with community organizers on a lot of asymmetrical, one-time projects.

367
00:23:18,967 --> 00:23:22,209
So they come to us with a lot of ideas, and we maintain an open-door policy,

368
00:23:22,249 --> 00:23:25,411
so anyone in the community can approach us with an idea, and we just...

369
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:29,234
you know, we figure out time to talk about it over Skype or through emails or whatever,

370
00:23:29,254 --> 00:23:32,236
and we just look at their idea, give them feedback on it, and help out.

371
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:37,385
Sometimes it's about a real-life player gathering, there's a lot of those.

372
00:23:37,845 --> 00:23:41,928
Sometimes it's a new website, it can be even a short film or documentary.

373
00:23:41,968 --> 00:23:44,750
We've had people doing things like that in the past and they need access to assets

374
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,211
or our internal tech people for some advice or something.

375
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:52,795
It can be an in-game charity event. We have a lot of charity events in EVE.

376
00:23:52,915 --> 00:23:57,218
Even though it has its cutthroat reputation, people set up large battles, give out free ships,

377
00:23:57,258 --> 00:23:58,779
and they collect donations for charity.

378
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,421
And we help them by advertising and making sure that everybody makes their way to them.

379
00:24:04,488 --> 00:24:11,592
And my approach with this is thinking about it so that you can always do something to help everyone.

380
00:24:12,212 --> 00:24:16,675
Even if it's just some advice or feedback, then take the time to look over it, give some feedback.

381
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:22,818
Some ideas are too big for now, and they need to be either scoped down a little bit,

382
00:24:23,078 --> 00:24:28,061
or people just need a reality check on what they can actually do with the resources they have.

383
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:30,422
And we can help because we've built experience with that.

384
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:37,225
But sometimes it's also about, you know, you just look at an idea and someone is struggling with something,

385
00:24:37,245 --> 00:24:40,808
needs something done, and we can connect them to someone else in the community, maybe,

386
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:42,990
because we have a lot of connections, so we do that a lot.

387
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:46,073
We help people connect to each other so they can work together.

388
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:55,481
And we manage a lot of relationships with these high-level community organizers that do bigger things for the community.

389
00:24:55,801 --> 00:24:59,163
So we work as sort of like account managers for those people.

390
00:25:00,423 --> 00:25:08,446
And the picture on the left there, it's from Evesterdam, which is an event that's held in Amsterdam by a player every year.

391
00:25:08,846 --> 00:25:14,128
And he runs a crew of volunteers that helps him run like a 300-strong convention. So 300 people come to this.

392
00:25:14,668 --> 00:25:17,349
Buy tickets, it's all planned very much in advance.

393
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:22,371
They have player presentations about D.Va Online and all kinds of things that players do in a game that's interesting.

394
00:25:22,751 --> 00:25:27,193
We also send developers over to give developer presentations, tell them about new things in the game.

395
00:25:27,513 --> 00:25:31,855
We send demos of our latest games like some VR games, Valkyrie and Gun Jack and that.

396
00:25:32,215 --> 00:25:34,336
So we can give them a glimpse into the future.

397
00:25:34,356 --> 00:25:36,897
So we kind of help them boost the attendance with stuff like that.

398
00:25:37,177 --> 00:25:44,020
And also we just hang out in the bars of Amsterdam into the night talking about D.Va Online and giving people access to our time.

399
00:25:45,537 --> 00:25:51,183
The one on the right is an event in Australia, which is called EVE Down Under, and that takes place every year as well.

400
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:55,107
I mean, another high-level convention that's organized only by players.

401
00:25:56,028 --> 00:26:03,896
And there, we only sent one person, because it's very far away, and then we Skyped in to do a Q&A, three of us.

402
00:26:04,835 --> 00:26:10,637
And that's another very cheap and non-committal way

403
00:26:10,697 --> 00:26:12,857
to do something for a player gathering, which is really

404
00:26:12,897 --> 00:26:14,938
awesome, because all you need to do is the Skype account,

405
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:17,038
and then you call in and let them ask some questions.

406
00:26:17,078 --> 00:26:18,358
And it just takes a bit of time.

407
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:20,199
I mean, this was at some weird hour,

408
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:21,159
because it's in Australia.

409
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,680
It was like 10 PM or something on a Saturday night.

410
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,920
So one of us was calling in from home.

411
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,121
So we had two webcams going.

412
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:31,101
And we conspired to turn both the webcams upside down,

413
00:26:31,742 --> 00:26:34,582
which is a joke that no Australian gets tired of.

414
00:26:38,602 --> 00:26:45,325
Then there's tournaments and esports. Esports in EVE are notoriously difficult.

415
00:26:45,365 --> 00:26:49,546
I would almost say impossible to run because you need our assistance to do it.

416
00:26:49,586 --> 00:26:53,208
You need, because in EVE Online you can't really just set up an arena and go fight.

417
00:26:53,808 --> 00:26:57,969
Anyone could come and blow you up, so there's no way to host like a safe tournament.

418
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:02,291
So we need to move people to like secluded systems that are cut off from everything.

419
00:27:02,351 --> 00:27:05,012
And we need to, you know, use some dev tools and stuff like that.

420
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,621
But we've had people run tournaments like that before, and we have someone just on there helping.

421
00:27:10,481 --> 00:27:16,723
One of them is Eve Antiqualites, which is run by a player called Nash Cadaver, who comes out of Nottingham.

422
00:27:16,763 --> 00:27:19,604
He's also running amazing events over there, like real-life events.

423
00:27:20,684 --> 00:27:23,645
And he ran a whole winter of tournaments.

424
00:27:24,485 --> 00:27:29,987
Really good stuff, but he wanted to grow it, and he wanted the top teams in EVE Online to join for his second season.

425
00:27:30,007 --> 00:27:32,448
So he came to us with a really well-written proposal.

426
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:40,074
and wanted us to make him unique shapeskins to give to every participant in the tournament.

427
00:27:40,695 --> 00:27:48,584
And it was a bit of a wild idea for us because we'd never created an asset for a player-created event uniquely.

428
00:27:48,644 --> 00:27:51,828
So we took a look at it and...

429
00:27:53,457 --> 00:27:57,159
I managed to convince a couple of producers that it wasn't a bad idea and we went ahead

430
00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:58,840
with it and it's gotten some good results.

431
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,123
He got all the teams he wanted, the top teams from our yearly official alliance tournament

432
00:28:03,944 --> 00:28:09,467
and he has seen a bump in viewership and a lot of interest and he's gotten sponsors,

433
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:13,250
I mean he gets like sponsors like Racer and Plantronics and stuff and it's really, really

434
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,131
cool stuff so we're trying to push the envelope on that.

435
00:28:16,158 --> 00:28:20,807
So I think it's a good example of an event that needed something from us to grow,

436
00:28:20,887 --> 00:28:22,690
but all the work is done by players.

437
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:24,534
He manages a team of 12 people that run this.

438
00:28:25,115 --> 00:28:26,337
We just help out a little bit.

439
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,042
And in return, we get so much content.

440
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:34,531
One of my favorite examples that I've been involved in is EveMeet.

441
00:28:34,571 --> 00:28:38,012
And this is a website that is designed to do primarily three things.

442
00:28:38,452 --> 00:28:41,694
It shows you upcoming real-life gatherings around the world.

443
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:45,395
It notifies you, if you sign up for it, of events happening near you.

444
00:28:45,855 --> 00:28:49,396
And you can create your own events that other people can sign up for.

445
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:53,298
We've been rolling the idea of a site like this around for a while.

446
00:28:53,338 --> 00:28:55,139
And it was like a web request internally

447
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,400
that suffered at the hands of prioritization for a while.

448
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,760
We all know that old monster.

449
00:29:01,893 --> 00:29:06,296
And then I was talking to the guys that organized the event in Australia that I was talking about.

450
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:10,878
And we were doing a Skype call about that event and we'd finished all the logistical planning and all that stuff.

451
00:29:10,898 --> 00:29:14,961
And then we just started talking and I was telling them about this idea that I wanted to create and la la la.

452
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:18,443
And they were just like, huh, it's a cool idea. And I explained it to them in detail.

453
00:29:18,503 --> 00:29:22,285
And then, like a couple of months later, they told me they were almost finished making it.

454
00:29:23,164 --> 00:29:26,447
So they went ahead and made the site. We didn't have to do anything.

455
00:29:27,188 --> 00:29:32,312
Then we've been just relentless in pushing it to everyone and letting people know about it.

456
00:29:32,392 --> 00:29:34,214
And on our live streams, on social media.

457
00:29:34,614 --> 00:29:41,880
And we've seen, since this site came up, it's become the primary hub for players to find real-life gatherings for e-players.

458
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:46,144
We've seen a marked increase in the number of player gatherings, the attendance,

459
00:29:46,224 --> 00:29:50,748
and they've been popping up in cities all over the world that have never had gatherings before.

460
00:29:51,876 --> 00:29:52,816
So that's awesome.

461
00:29:55,657 --> 00:29:57,778
And I mean, player gatherings, they're very important to us.

462
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:02,319
But like, why? Why do we want to push people so hard towards player gatherings?

463
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,542
I think they are very cool for any gamers, but I think they're particularly important for us.

464
00:30:10,262 --> 00:30:15,784
Because, like I said, EVE is a very, you know, it's an intense hobby to people,

465
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:18,025
and people get dug pretty deep into it.

466
00:30:19,128 --> 00:30:22,709
Meeting people that love the same thing as you that much is fun.

467
00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:26,490
It's just, I mean, our brains, they haven't changed since forever,

468
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,231
even though, like, technology is always updating.

469
00:30:28,731 --> 00:30:31,232
And our brains are just wired for face-to-face communications.

470
00:30:31,292 --> 00:30:31,792
We like that.

471
00:30:32,692 --> 00:30:33,933
And player gatherings do that.

472
00:30:35,065 --> 00:30:36,427
We've been pushing player gatherings.

473
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,190
There's like hundreds of them around the world.

474
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,493
Most of them run exclusively by players.

475
00:30:40,854 --> 00:30:43,377
We support them by advertising them so people come to them.

476
00:30:43,457 --> 00:30:45,300
We send them care packages with swag.

477
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:49,025
We Skype in sometimes, and sometimes we even send people.

478
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:55,121
I mean, we've been stubbornly pushing it since forever.

479
00:30:55,161 --> 00:30:59,163
We just continuously push the idea of specific meats

480
00:30:59,283 --> 00:31:01,524
and just tell people about it.

481
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:03,745
Encouraging people that have never taken the leap

482
00:31:03,765 --> 00:31:06,746
to go and see people in real life just to try it out.

483
00:31:06,846 --> 00:31:10,908
And we find that the effects are very good, very good.

484
00:31:11,926 --> 00:31:14,088
We've been going to them. This costs money, of course.

485
00:31:14,128 --> 00:31:16,290
We send developers to these gatherings,

486
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,813
but we believe that it has great returns

487
00:31:20,113 --> 00:31:23,897
and has benefits for both the developers and the players

488
00:31:23,937 --> 00:31:25,958
that get to meet the developers and interact with them.

489
00:31:26,735 --> 00:31:28,476
It creates a relationship, so to speak.

490
00:31:29,477 --> 00:31:31,379
And then we host our own events,

491
00:31:31,499 --> 00:31:34,342
and like the official FanFest in Iceland every year,

492
00:31:34,522 --> 00:31:38,126
and Eve Vegas, which takes place in Las Vegas, of course,

493
00:31:38,226 --> 00:31:40,628
every year, which is becoming almost as big

494
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,390
as FanFest, and it's a crazy, crazy party.

495
00:31:44,591 --> 00:31:50,358
It's a very important thing and I think what we have felt when we come back from FanFest for example,

496
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:54,302
where we are kind of like bathed in the passion of EVE players for a week,

497
00:31:54,803 --> 00:31:58,287
is that we just come out with energy. We just come out with more energy.

498
00:31:58,327 --> 00:31:59,869
We're really tired of course, but it's just like...

499
00:32:00,689 --> 00:32:04,132
We want to do that thing that we didn't have time for, that we thought about a long time ago,

500
00:32:04,152 --> 00:32:05,973
and it's like we push harder and do more.

501
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:10,997
It increases your engagement to feel other people's passion like that,

502
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:16,181
and we believe it has exactly the same effect on players, and we know actually,

503
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:19,844
and that when they come back, if they've never met people before, that also plays.

504
00:32:20,124 --> 00:32:23,367
You know, they go and have fun, drink some beers and talk, and then, you know,

505
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:26,289
when you get back to the game, you just kind of see everything a little differently,

506
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:27,390
and it feels more fun.

507
00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:36,130
The pitfalls of backing player projects are, you know, there's just a few that you really have to take care of.

508
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:42,312
I mean, if you back a project super hard and it fails super hard, you'll probably take the hit too.

509
00:32:42,372 --> 00:32:49,334
I mean, I've kind of run into this once or twice where you're super enthusiastic about something and don't background check it completely

510
00:32:49,374 --> 00:32:53,875
and then it turns out to be a bit of a disaster and you have to do some cleanup and apologizing or something.

511
00:32:55,803 --> 00:33:03,111
It's best to just be brutally honest up front, you know, friendly but honest, and just give people that feedback early on.

512
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:07,956
Do the background checks, be critical of the plans, get the plans laid out in enough detail, etc.

513
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,762
It's important to be fair when you're deciding which thing to back and which thing not to back,

514
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:19,543
because you may be deciding to back this project and not a similar one.

515
00:33:20,764 --> 00:33:24,345
But the way I look at it, this is something that's happening outside the game.

516
00:33:24,365 --> 00:33:25,585
This is essentially business.

517
00:33:25,665 --> 00:33:29,166
It doesn't have to be 100% fair.

518
00:33:29,186 --> 00:33:30,827
So don't let fairness cripple you.

519
00:33:31,527 --> 00:33:32,307
The world isn't fair.

520
00:33:32,367 --> 00:33:34,208
Just do what you think is right.

521
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:37,649
Spend your limited resources in the way that you think will have the best impact.

522
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:44,514
Then, with CSB, this is something we sort of fell into as a startup company,

523
00:33:44,534 --> 00:33:47,595
and we've kind of grown up with it, and it works well for us.

524
00:33:47,655 --> 00:33:51,676
It's having direct, free-flowing communication between developers and players.

525
00:33:52,016 --> 00:33:56,998
We even made a song about this, almost, which is our in-house band called The Permaband.

526
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:59,919
It's called Killing is Just a Means of Communication,

527
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:03,079
because at the end of the day, even if we're shooting each other in the face,

528
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:06,060
it's all about communication, and communication is the heart of everything we do.

529
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:10,603
So we'd rather have too much of it than too little of it.

530
00:34:13,065 --> 00:34:22,010
The benefits of allowing developers the freedom to speak to players in an ungated fashion, there's many.

531
00:34:22,111 --> 00:34:25,533
I mean, people get good at it over time.

532
00:34:25,953 --> 00:34:32,878
They feel more like a sense of personal pride and ambition representing their own work than if someone is always doing it for them.

533
00:34:34,485 --> 00:34:38,426
And they also just get to know the players and what they like about the product better.

534
00:34:39,386 --> 00:34:43,267
So we encourage developers to communicate with players about work,

535
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:45,368
but also just about whatever they want to talk about.

536
00:34:45,428 --> 00:34:50,589
If you're on Reddit or Twitter or the forums and people are talking about something that's out of game and fun,

537
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:54,131
you can talk about what you're interested in.

538
00:34:54,711 --> 00:34:55,771
Relationship building is cool.

539
00:35:02,092 --> 00:35:05,896
Official communication goes through the same pathways and processes as in any other company, of course.

540
00:35:06,497 --> 00:35:09,660
We just have this extra flow of freestyle communication.

541
00:35:11,502 --> 00:35:18,209
The problems with freestyle communication, I mean, the biggest thing I would tell you to avoid is not having guidelines.

542
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:23,114
It's good to have guidelines, just the spirit of what you want to achieve and what you don't want to do.

543
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,493
If you have bad guidelines, that's bad, obviously.

544
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:37,861
Bad guidelines to me are super-ruly, really like documents with a lot of nitpicking and detail.

545
00:35:37,881 --> 00:35:42,685
It doesn't have to be like that. It just gets micro-lawyered and it's not fun. It scares people away.

546
00:35:44,426 --> 00:35:48,850
Then, not saying something if someone is not handling it well.

547
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:52,893
If someone is not handling communication, you have to talk to them.

548
00:35:54,709 --> 00:36:01,936
Help them out, be there for people if something isn't working out, and clean up if things have to be cleaned up, and stuff like that.

549
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:10,304
But not all communication is informal and casual.

550
00:36:11,185 --> 00:36:20,333
We have something we call the Council of Stellar Management, which is a democratically elected council of e-players, elected by other players in an election every year.

551
00:36:21,382 --> 00:36:26,151
They're flown to Iceland for four days of summits with the

552
00:36:26,211 --> 00:36:27,934
people who make it online.

553
00:36:28,884 --> 00:36:32,145
And we have a lot of online meetings with them, like every week.

554
00:36:32,246 --> 00:36:34,887
And there's a lot of crazy politics that goes into it.

555
00:36:34,947 --> 00:36:37,609
I mean, players are intensely interested in who gets onto this.

556
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:40,070
Some of them are representing power blocks,

557
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:42,832
and are just voted in in an organized fashion by power blocks.

558
00:36:42,852 --> 00:36:46,074
Some are voted in because they represent a certain play style,

559
00:36:46,174 --> 00:36:47,695
or some special interest group.

560
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:51,177
And then some people are just voted in on integrity alone,

561
00:36:51,217 --> 00:36:53,518
like they're great people and people believe they'll do good.

562
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:54,419
And then they come to us.

563
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,780
And they acted like an early...

564
00:36:56,823 --> 00:36:58,664
They're like the canary in the coal mine for us.

565
00:36:58,724 --> 00:37:01,706
The early warning sign if we're going the wrong route.

566
00:37:01,726 --> 00:37:09,110
Like I said, sometimes eBay is complicated and it's easy to steer features in a direction that seems great,

567
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,491
but there's some things we hadn't thought about.

568
00:37:10,511 --> 00:37:12,732
So having an early soundboard is really good.

569
00:37:12,793 --> 00:37:15,854
And these people sign an NDA and they're privy to early information.

570
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:23,354
I may be forcing the wind analogy a little hard, but it's true.

571
00:37:23,835 --> 00:37:27,878
We're forcing a lot of feedback from a lot of people through a very narrow tunnel

572
00:37:27,898 --> 00:37:29,599
so we can signal out a lot of noise.

573
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:32,782
These people are very well connected.

574
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:36,605
These are expert players who have a lot of connections to the community.

575
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:40,308
They have above average social skills and talent.

576
00:37:40,348 --> 00:37:44,612
They bring us the feedback of the people that aren't necessarily vocal on forums and everywhere else.

577
00:37:44,772 --> 00:37:46,173
They bring us structured feedback.

578
00:37:47,935 --> 00:37:54,982
And then the picture is from the election of the 10th CSM from last year.

579
00:37:55,262 --> 00:37:58,985
We now have another election, so there's a lot of campaigning going on and we'll have

580
00:37:59,005 --> 00:38:01,508
a new CSM in just over a month.

581
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:06,840
But this is a good example, I think.

582
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,621
This project is a good example of two things.

583
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:13,863
It's giving your players some agency in your development process

584
00:38:13,883 --> 00:38:17,645
so they feel like they're part of it and also can give you great feedback.

585
00:38:18,145 --> 00:38:21,646
And for us, career-wise, I think it's a very interesting project

586
00:38:22,226 --> 00:38:25,308
that allows us to do quite high-level stuff.

587
00:38:25,348 --> 00:38:28,149
I mean, we have to plan summits, fly people in internationally,

588
00:38:28,189 --> 00:38:29,169
deal with visa issues.

589
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:33,069
We need to book meetings every week with designers, producers,

590
00:38:34,169 --> 00:38:34,949
executives even.

591
00:38:35,149 --> 00:38:37,190
And we have to do a lot of expectation management

592
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:41,011
and use all our diplomacy skills to avert drama all the time.

593
00:38:41,051 --> 00:38:44,732
So it's a really fun project to be involved in.

594
00:38:45,572 --> 00:38:47,092
And I mean, the ancient Greeks, they

595
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,113
had this sort of figured out before us.

596
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:50,273
We didn't invent it.

597
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,854
We're just making it a little better every day.

598
00:38:55,084 --> 00:39:01,330
And then sometimes it's time to get your hands dirty and grab the oars and do something, create some content of your own.

599
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:07,217
And one example of that is a show that I produce and host with some of my wonderful colleagues.

600
00:39:07,897 --> 00:39:10,440
It's called O7, the EVE Online Show.

601
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,706
O7 is like a salute that players do in game. It's an O and a 7, so it's a sign to the respect.

602
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,951
that EVE players have for each other.

603
00:39:20,212 --> 00:39:23,895
And this is a show that makes sense for us to do in-house.

604
00:39:23,935 --> 00:39:25,977
I mean, there's a lot of good media in the EVE community.

605
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:30,101
Podcasts, streams, even, you know, like tape shows,

606
00:39:30,181 --> 00:39:34,004
but we have access to funds, obviously, that players don't have,

607
00:39:34,024 --> 00:39:36,086
so we can do things on a higher production level.

608
00:39:37,187 --> 00:39:42,051
And we have access to all that in-house development information

609
00:39:42,071 --> 00:39:43,412
that nobody else has, so we...

610
00:39:44,229 --> 00:39:49,533
We can use that to leverage views, and we get many times the views that any player stream can get for that reason.

611
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:55,699
But then again, even if it's our show about our stuff, it's also mostly about the players.

612
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:03,466
And we talk to players about things they do, we highlight cool projects and events that are happening, and direct people in those directions.

613
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:09,411
So we put a big spotlight on what the players are doing, but we also commission work directly from content creators.

614
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:10,132
So for example...

615
00:40:11,067 --> 00:40:15,331
There's an EVE player called Hendrik Tellerdaar that makes us an 07 report every month,

616
00:40:15,711 --> 00:40:20,556
where he does a dive into the politics and wars of EVE Online and tells us what's going on there.

617
00:40:20,976 --> 00:40:22,718
He obviously knows a lot more about it than we do.

618
00:40:23,607 --> 00:40:25,108
And it's much better at telling that story.

619
00:40:25,448 --> 00:40:27,088
So it's better for our players.

620
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:28,189
I mean, it saves us time.

621
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,590
It gives him a bigger platform for the material

622
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:32,350
that he's making.

623
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,811
Anyway, so it's a win-win situation.

624
00:40:37,291 --> 00:40:38,972
One other example, something we've

625
00:40:38,992 --> 00:40:43,353
been just commissioned recently is Prosper Market Analysis

626
00:40:43,373 --> 00:40:44,393
by a player called Lockfox.

627
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:46,074
And he's an economist by trade, I believe.

628
00:40:46,494 --> 00:40:48,634
And he does a really technical deep dive

629
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:49,035
into the

630
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:55,336
complicated market systems of EVE Online to help people better speculate and leverage their money in the game.

631
00:40:55,636 --> 00:40:56,757
It's very, very interesting stuff.

632
00:40:57,737 --> 00:41:01,338
Again, something that would be very time consuming and difficult for us to do properly.

633
00:41:02,758 --> 00:41:05,219
And then we also have a little bit of fun once in a while.

634
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:11,540
Last April Fools, we had a show hit on that day, so we called up The Mountain from Game of Thrones.

635
00:41:12,241 --> 00:41:15,821
He lives in Reykjavik too, so it's not far away, and he fits into our building and everything.

636
00:41:17,105 --> 00:41:21,088
We got him to fill my spot for the introduction of the show

637
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:24,150
to see if people would notice the difference, which they did.

638
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,852
I even put him in the same shirt, but EVE players are smart.

639
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:32,955
So if we just round this up,

640
00:41:35,816 --> 00:41:37,978
we talked about boosting and supporting player projects.

641
00:41:38,018 --> 00:41:40,179
This is something that I think is very important.

642
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:42,660
For a community team to be able to spend time on this,

643
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,082
they need to have some free time, and we have that.

644
00:41:46,529 --> 00:41:53,494
Devote time to looking at what players are doing, reading up on that, and talking to them, having this open-door policy, booking meetings with them, talking about stuff.

645
00:41:53,854 --> 00:41:59,058
And I think it brings a lot of benefits, and it often has benefits that you don't spot in advance.

646
00:41:59,978 --> 00:42:06,363
They come to you with an idea that you wouldn't have thought of, and they come to you because they've talked to you before, and they kind of, you know, we have this thing going on.

647
00:42:06,403 --> 00:42:07,284
So that's good.

648
00:42:08,624 --> 00:42:10,606
I think companies should be doing this.

649
00:42:12,202 --> 00:42:12,802
Any chance they get.

650
00:42:13,663 --> 00:42:15,504
Volunteer programs are amazing.

651
00:42:15,604 --> 00:42:16,344
They're just great.

652
00:42:16,764 --> 00:42:18,925
There's a lot of things, there's a lot of tasks

653
00:42:19,405 --> 00:42:20,085
that you have to do,

654
00:42:21,286 --> 00:42:24,787
but aren't necessarily vital in-house functions,

655
00:42:24,847 --> 00:42:25,368
like I've said.

656
00:42:25,428 --> 00:42:27,909
So, I mean, we've proven that there is a positive,

657
00:42:27,929 --> 00:42:30,149
you can set up a system that is self-reliant

658
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:33,111
and efficient to do things that, you know,

659
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:34,871
most companies have to do to some capacity.

660
00:42:34,891 --> 00:42:38,033
So I would definitely recommend looking into that.

661
00:42:38,093 --> 00:42:40,194
Plus you find some great people in the process

662
00:42:40,234 --> 00:42:41,294
and get to know some amazing people.

663
00:42:43,127 --> 00:42:46,008
Encouraging face-to-face meetups is a no-brainer to me.

664
00:42:46,148 --> 00:42:49,529
It's something that I enjoy being a part of immensely,

665
00:42:49,729 --> 00:42:51,970
and I know our developers benefit greatly from it.

666
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:56,831
One thing you can do that is very cheap and quick and easy

667
00:42:57,412 --> 00:43:01,013
is to organize a meetup around an event like this,

668
00:43:01,073 --> 00:43:02,633
like a GDC, PAX, something like that,

669
00:43:02,673 --> 00:43:04,194
where you have a lot of people out there anyway.

670
00:43:04,954 --> 00:43:05,534
So why not?

671
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:11,104
Book something in a bar, buy a few kegs of beer, just, you know, advertise on your social media,

672
00:43:11,124 --> 00:43:13,246
go talk to people, see where you stand, see if you like it.

673
00:43:13,266 --> 00:43:15,849
I'm sure your developers, you guys will like it.

674
00:43:15,929 --> 00:43:17,971
It's... everybody will love it.

675
00:43:18,071 --> 00:43:22,615
And for, if there's any managers here, it's also a great way to make your people work nights.

676
00:43:24,037 --> 00:43:25,959
But, yeah, I definitely do that.

677
00:43:27,064 --> 00:43:32,370
Then, you know, giving your players some agency, some stake in the development of the game is great.

678
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:34,812
A lot of people are running focus groups.

679
00:43:34,852 --> 00:43:36,714
We have a democratically elected focus group.

680
00:43:36,734 --> 00:43:39,017
That doesn't maybe, you know, maybe that doesn't work for everybody.

681
00:43:40,029 --> 00:43:43,171
Maybe we'll have the People's Council of Krust can't be one day.

682
00:43:43,812 --> 00:43:48,495
Or if people just want to do more casual focus groups that they handpick,

683
00:43:48,715 --> 00:43:54,679
there's still things you can probably do like allowing players to vote on certain priorities

684
00:43:54,779 --> 00:44:00,102
or final outcomes or stuff like that on certain things in whatever limited capacity you're comfortable with.

685
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:02,163
But it's fun to give your players a say.

686
00:44:04,332 --> 00:44:08,856
And then maintaining direct, ungated communication is something that I recommend.

687
00:44:09,216 --> 00:44:13,020
It's not for everyone, I know that, and there's a lot of companies that are very big,

688
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,463
where things have to be more formal and I completely understand that.

689
00:44:17,178 --> 00:44:20,140
But I would definitely recommend checking it out.

690
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,022
One good thing about it is that we see who's good at communicating

691
00:44:24,342 --> 00:44:28,163
and then we can, for example, decide to send those people to those player gatherings I talked about.

692
00:44:28,183 --> 00:44:32,845
So by spending some extra time on engaging with the community and building a relationship there,

693
00:44:32,885 --> 00:44:35,247
you might end up in Australia one day talking about EVE.

694
00:44:36,389 --> 00:44:41,712
And like I said, if you have a chance to go the formal route or the more playful, ungated route of communication,

695
00:44:41,752 --> 00:44:48,216
I'd recommend the more playful one, because we are in the entertainment business and we sometimes forget that.

696
00:44:49,876 --> 00:44:54,780
But I want to end this with a video that is very dear to me.

697
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,342
It completely wasn't made for this presentation or anything.

698
00:44:57,382 --> 00:44:59,364
A player made this for me by chance.

699
00:44:59,724 --> 00:45:01,646
It's a player called Chimera.

700
00:45:01,966 --> 00:45:03,568
He also plays a game called ArcheAge.

701
00:45:03,928 --> 00:45:06,410
And he made this video for me in ArcheAge.

702
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,131
And it brings tears to my eye every time.

703
00:45:08,171 --> 00:45:08,652
It's beautiful.

704
00:45:09,152 --> 00:45:09,753
Very inspiring.

705
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:32,267
I just had to squeeze that in there.

706
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,187
It's like so fitting.

707
00:45:34,247 --> 00:45:34,527
Thank you.

708
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:35,788
That's it for me.

709
00:45:35,868 --> 00:45:37,128
If you have any questions, fire away.

710
00:45:42,641 --> 00:45:49,927
Hi, that was a great talk, thank you. I'm an Eve player and I've been a big fan of your volunteer groups.

711
00:45:51,008 --> 00:45:55,773
One of my questions though is, have you ever had any problems with the...

712
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:05,340
a legal gray area of having volunteers who are doing things that are almost like work that you would normally pay them for,

713
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:11,925
and you're paying them non-monetarily. Does that cause problems for you, and does that change your approach with them?

714
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:19,391
Are you unable to give them direction in what they're doing, or do they have to just come up with whatever they want to do themselves?

715
00:46:20,091 --> 00:46:25,596
I know there was a lot of discussion about this like a few years ago, but one of the things we do,

716
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:28,439
we don't mandate like any number of hours from people.

717
00:46:28,459 --> 00:46:33,324
We just want people to be active over time, but we don't mandate, for example,

718
00:46:33,364 --> 00:46:38,268
you have to do this much necessarily to be allowed to be in the program.

719
00:46:38,288 --> 00:46:42,152
We just, you know, you put in the time you can and just stay active and you're all good.

720
00:46:42,212 --> 00:46:43,433
And that's one of the things we do.

721
00:46:44,214 --> 00:46:45,115
Obviously, we just like...

722
00:46:45,935 --> 00:46:47,595
We can't give every task to players.

723
00:46:47,615 --> 00:46:49,095
I mean, there has to be some limit to that.

724
00:46:50,376 --> 00:46:51,676
And people get into it.

725
00:46:51,716 --> 00:46:52,296
They're adults.

726
00:46:52,336 --> 00:46:53,016
They know what they're doing.

727
00:46:53,556 --> 00:46:57,357
There's a very clear line of what this is and what everybody taking part in it.

728
00:46:57,597 --> 00:46:58,517
We've been good with that.

729
00:47:01,278 --> 00:47:06,238
Can you describe any positive or negative experiences with user-created content?

730
00:47:07,459 --> 00:47:11,919
Positive and negative experiences with user-created content.

731
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,640
Well, there's...

732
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,301
I mean, obviously, there's always a lot of drama around some things.

733
00:47:19,361 --> 00:47:22,823
Some people make content to cause drama.

734
00:47:23,303 --> 00:47:25,144
We generally just stay out of that.

735
00:47:25,464 --> 00:47:31,126
We don't get involved, and we try not to touch things that are likely to cause drama in any official way.

736
00:47:31,166 --> 00:47:35,348
So if, for example, someone is a bit of a troll and is making content,

737
00:47:35,368 --> 00:47:37,789
we probably wouldn't commission them for doing work for us.

738
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:39,369
We deal with people who...

739
00:47:40,137 --> 00:47:43,880
who we trust to understand the bigger picture and do the right thing.

740
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,602
So, yeah, there have been some things, but nothing too terrible.

741
00:47:47,963 --> 00:47:50,344
And we just take care not to, you know, when we're linking to stuff,

742
00:47:50,424 --> 00:47:52,366
to make sure it's OK, it's not something horrible.

743
00:47:54,687 --> 00:47:54,847
Hey.

744
00:47:55,528 --> 00:47:58,530
Hey. So, I'm an absolute disaster when talking to the community.

745
00:47:59,511 --> 00:48:01,412
And I guess with having so many of you developers

746
00:48:02,192 --> 00:48:03,894
directly interfacing with the community,

747
00:48:03,954 --> 00:48:05,415
which is something that they don't do primarily,

748
00:48:05,975 --> 00:48:06,916
is there a...

749
00:48:08,205 --> 00:48:15,708
A single piece of advice or training materials, or how do you prepare those developers to talk and interact with the community?

750
00:48:33,673 --> 00:48:40,847
But one of the things we have in our guidelines, for example, is that we train people not to talk too much about other people's work.

751
00:48:41,208 --> 00:48:44,194
I mean, we as communication professionals, we talk about other people's works.

752
00:48:44,836 --> 00:48:52,918
But someone who's maybe a programmer, he's not talking about something that an artist is doing and vice versa in any detail or promising anything that they can't deliver on.

753
00:48:52,938 --> 00:48:57,338
So we want people to focus on their specialty and rather summon someone else if they need to.

754
00:48:57,378 --> 00:49:00,759
And then we have some guidelines on just being very professional and friendly and all that.

755
00:49:00,819 --> 00:49:05,080
And even if you're doing this, like if you're just chatting to people about your favorite football team or whatever,

756
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:09,341
just always remember you are an employee first and foremost anytime you're talking to a player.

757
00:49:09,381 --> 00:49:12,722
It's just something that's a common sense thing that people need to...

758
00:49:13,122 --> 00:49:15,824
It needs some training sometimes, but most people can handle it pretty well.

759
00:49:15,844 --> 00:49:17,726
And I think if you allow people to do it, they get better at it.

760
00:49:19,787 --> 00:49:22,029
Hello. Thank you for the talk. Great talk.

761
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:27,233
I've got two questions, and maybe the answer is worth a separate presentation.

762
00:49:27,914 --> 00:49:28,735
Yeah.

763
00:49:28,855 --> 00:49:35,300
But first of all, we all know that when we're talking about games that have been around for quite a while,

764
00:49:36,681 --> 00:49:41,326
Players there, the players know the game much better than developers.

765
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:42,167
Yeah.

766
00:49:42,627 --> 00:49:47,752
And how do you approach features that community proposes?

767
00:49:48,353 --> 00:49:49,594
That's the question number one.

768
00:49:49,634 --> 00:49:54,619
Do you have any kind of guidelines to how you like pass stuff to developers or something like that?

769
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:56,201
And the second one...

770
00:49:57,462 --> 00:50:01,487
Even if you think that the feature the player proposes is good enough,

771
00:50:02,128 --> 00:50:06,493
but there are definitely way more stuff the community brings to you than you can develop.

772
00:50:07,034 --> 00:50:12,560
And even if you agree that this is good, how do you deal with that, like, whining and stuff that,

773
00:50:12,741 --> 00:50:16,005
hey, you're not doing this, I told you to do this, like, years ago?

774
00:50:16,897 --> 00:50:25,207
So community proposing features and how we deal with the, I guess, expectation management of what these features we don't decide to develop.

775
00:50:26,268 --> 00:50:32,696
Well, one thing, for example, that the Council of Stellar Management can do is that they can provide features officially with access to our internal site.

776
00:50:32,716 --> 00:50:33,857
So they make like a feature cart.

777
00:50:34,618 --> 00:50:37,722
for a feature proposal and they propose like roadmap changes and stuff like that.

778
00:50:37,742 --> 00:50:38,743
So that's one formal way.

779
00:50:39,123 --> 00:50:42,146
Then we have, you know, the regular like forums where people propose ideas and

780
00:50:42,587 --> 00:50:45,129
and this active conversation that we have with players

781
00:50:45,930 --> 00:50:48,373
so that like developers that are specialists in an area,

782
00:50:48,393 --> 00:50:51,076
they often have like a group of people that are very good in that area

783
00:50:51,096 --> 00:50:52,257
and they talk to them regularly.

784
00:50:52,297 --> 00:50:54,299
It's like sort of like an unofficially also.

785
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:56,541
So they get feedback and bounce ideas off people.

786
00:50:57,905 --> 00:51:00,065
So we validate ideas like that.

787
00:51:00,365 --> 00:51:02,926
And then when it comes to deciding what not to do,

788
00:51:02,966 --> 00:51:05,807
I mean, that's classic expectation management.

789
00:51:05,827 --> 00:51:07,907
We have to, you know, there's sometimes

790
00:51:07,947 --> 00:51:09,347
like a lot of noise about something

791
00:51:09,387 --> 00:51:11,648
that we can't realistically get into right now,

792
00:51:11,788 --> 00:51:13,548
or it's just maybe not a great idea.

793
00:51:13,588 --> 00:51:15,989
And then we have to discuss it, spend some time discussing it.

794
00:51:16,409 --> 00:51:19,530
Or, you know, at least if it's a good idea that we have to do,

795
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:21,510
but we can't do it now, we have to tell them to.

796
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:24,891
You know, we have to like lay down some information on when

797
00:51:24,911 --> 00:51:25,931
we can do it or something like that.

798
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:27,052
Thank you.

799
00:51:29,665 --> 00:51:33,187
Right, well, thanks for the good last talk of GDC, for me at least.

800
00:51:35,169 --> 00:51:41,433
I was wondering, when you essentially endorse certain player-made material, websites, streams,

801
00:51:41,513 --> 00:51:46,276
whatever, how do you deal with potential friction that arises?

802
00:51:46,336 --> 00:51:49,539
Because let's say you endorse something that's made by a Goon Swarm player,

803
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,321
certain other factions in the game might find that highly unfair and favoritist,

804
00:51:53,822 --> 00:51:57,024
and we know EVE players aren't the most forgiving in that sense.

805
00:51:57,084 --> 00:51:57,945
So how do you deal with that?

806
00:51:59,422 --> 00:52:05,966
Thing is, dealing with material made by players that are connected to factions and stuff like that,

807
00:52:07,547 --> 00:52:10,389
we don't have to deal with a lot of follow-up from it.

808
00:52:10,449 --> 00:52:12,211
I hope it's because we pick them well.

809
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:17,334
And like I said, I'm aware that I'm, for example,

810
00:52:17,374 --> 00:52:20,536
I'm commissioning a video from a guy who's in Pandemic Legion,

811
00:52:20,576 --> 00:52:24,279
who's one of the constantly warring factions of EVE Online,

812
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:33,085
I mean, I'm aware that their enemies might not like it, but we tend to pick people who have a reputation of already doing good things.

813
00:52:33,786 --> 00:52:37,669
They make material that appeals to a wide group of people.

814
00:52:38,049 --> 00:52:43,974
We don't allow for any direct propaganda for anyone, so we want people to keep that separate.

815
00:52:45,464 --> 00:52:48,790
So we don't host propaganda, unless we advertise for

816
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:49,571
material like that.

817
00:52:49,611 --> 00:52:51,835
And maybe we ask everyone to send in their propaganda, and

818
00:52:51,875 --> 00:52:52,516
we air all of it.

819
00:52:52,957 --> 00:52:53,778
We could do that.

820
00:52:54,579 --> 00:52:56,302
But yeah, we haven't had a lot of follow up.

821
00:52:56,322 --> 00:52:59,608
But we'll have to see if that comes up.

822
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:05,258
So with your user testing and your user research,

823
00:53:05,298 --> 00:53:07,059
have you completely done away with some sort

824
00:53:07,079 --> 00:53:08,259
of formal system for that?

825
00:53:08,299 --> 00:53:10,921
Or do you use your community for that, your little subgroups

826
00:53:10,961 --> 00:53:11,601
and things like that?

827
00:53:11,641 --> 00:53:13,422
Do you release special builds to some

828
00:53:13,442 --> 00:53:16,003
of these groups for preview of features and things like that?

829
00:53:16,043 --> 00:53:17,784
Or do you still do it in a formal capacity as well?

830
00:53:18,198 --> 00:53:19,199
Well, there's a lot of formal stuff.

831
00:53:19,219 --> 00:53:22,062
Like, I'm not an expert in all of that, but the user testing

832
00:53:22,082 --> 00:53:22,622
and all that stuff.

833
00:53:22,662 --> 00:53:24,384
But we do AP tests.

834
00:53:24,584 --> 00:53:25,965
We've been doing AP tests for a while.

835
00:53:27,166 --> 00:53:30,308
And we do research also formally.

836
00:53:30,388 --> 00:53:33,831
So it's not all just like informally chatting with the

837
00:53:33,851 --> 00:53:34,372
players and all that.

838
00:53:34,412 --> 00:53:36,674
This is kind of like a bonus on top of everything else.

839
00:53:36,734 --> 00:53:38,015
But yeah.

840
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:40,497
One more.

841
00:53:41,077 --> 00:53:41,918
Yes.

842
00:53:42,518 --> 00:53:45,821
That players console group that you talked about, are

843
00:53:45,841 --> 00:53:47,022
they aware of your roadmap?

844
00:53:48,053 --> 00:53:49,974
The player advocacy groups?

845
00:53:50,154 --> 00:53:51,975
No, the council of Stellar Madison.

846
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:52,655
The council.

847
00:53:53,176 --> 00:53:54,056
Yes.

848
00:53:54,116 --> 00:53:56,257
Like the best guys.

849
00:53:58,678 --> 00:54:00,539
We're talking about the ISD or the CSI?

850
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,300
No, those that you fly here to the studio.

851
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:02,860
Ok.

852
00:54:06,124 --> 00:54:11,246
Interstellar Service Department, the volunteers, they're not aware of the roadmap much except

853
00:54:11,566 --> 00:54:13,827
maybe some select countries that they need to know some things.

854
00:54:15,167 --> 00:54:21,330
But the democratically elected council, they are aware of the roadmap and they get most

855
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:22,450
information very early.

856
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:26,431
They get the most information out of anyone who doesn't work for CCP.

857
00:54:27,452 --> 00:54:28,212
So they're very trusted.

858
00:54:30,224 --> 00:54:30,744
How you doing man?

859
00:54:30,845 --> 00:54:32,246
Talk was awesome.

860
00:54:32,386 --> 00:54:33,306
So thanks for that.

861
00:54:33,326 --> 00:54:37,389
That was awesome information that I'm going to try to implement, but I'm on a very small

862
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:42,233
team, like a team of four, so we don't really have a dedicated community team to kind of

863
00:54:42,293 --> 00:54:44,875
manage these kinds of I guess initiative projects.

864
00:54:44,955 --> 00:54:48,177
So I'm curious, what would your advice be for somebody who's trying to get some of these

865
00:54:48,217 --> 00:54:51,399
off the ground or like places to start or route I should take?

866
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,360
I'm just kind of curious.

867
00:54:52,972 --> 00:55:04,957
Yeah, it's interesting. For a small team, what you should start with, I would look at doing some volunteer stuff, like get some volunteers on board to help with some things that work for you.

868
00:55:05,817 --> 00:55:14,721
I mean, all the more if you have a small team, then you need the help. We have one guy managing these teams as a part-time job, and they do a lot of good stuff for us.

869
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:19,435
When you get players involved, like we were talking about, they're the experts.

870
00:55:19,455 --> 00:55:21,616
They often do things better than we do, you know, some of the things.

871
00:55:22,137 --> 00:55:30,563
So I would do that, and I would start hunting around for these, like, what do you want to call them?

872
00:55:30,583 --> 00:55:35,727
Like super users, content creators, people who want to do some extra stuff, make tools, all that stuff.

873
00:55:35,747 --> 00:55:38,069
Like find those guys and do something for them.

874
00:55:38,689 --> 00:55:40,290
Even if it's formal or informal, just...

875
00:55:41,631 --> 00:55:41,751
Yeah.

876
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:42,852
Cool. Thanks so much.

877
00:55:43,433 --> 00:55:43,733
You're welcome.

878
00:55:46,631 --> 00:55:47,012
We're good.

879
00:55:47,032 --> 00:55:48,598
All right, cool.

880
00:55:50,685 --> 00:55:52,170
I'll be around if you want to talk.
