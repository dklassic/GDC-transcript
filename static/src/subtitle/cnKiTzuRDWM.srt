1
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:11,599
What was that?

2
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:12,520
My apologies.

3
00:00:19,643 --> 00:00:23,885
Many people think the character design is a job limited to character artists or senior

4
00:00:23,905 --> 00:00:24,305
writers.

5
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:30,147
But this is not true anymore in the next generation open world RPG where players spend more than

6
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:33,509
99% of their time with a character inside a real-time gameplay.

7
00:00:34,589 --> 00:00:37,550
Cinematics are just one way among many of character storytelling.

8
00:00:40,923 --> 00:00:43,604
Final Fantasy XV is one of the good examples of this.

9
00:00:44,104 --> 00:00:46,426
Rather than limit ourselves to character design,

10
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:50,007
we focused on the character experience design.

11
00:00:50,027 --> 00:00:53,629
For this project, we chose to have CS, the character experience,

12
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:55,310
expressed by an AI.

13
00:00:57,011 --> 00:00:58,152
Man, it's hot.

14
00:00:58,672 --> 00:00:59,652
Then lose the jacket.

15
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:03,254
My name is Sun, the lead game designer of Final Fantasy XV,

16
00:01:03,394 --> 00:01:05,555
in charge of bodies and photos in the AI system.

17
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:13,013
In this session, we will cover how we designed our main characters, CX,

18
00:01:13,693 --> 00:01:25,397
and how we used animations, voices, and game design to achieve AIs that make you feel emotional.

19
00:01:25,577 --> 00:01:32,200
No formal knowledge in any field is required, yet I am sure both beginners and experts will find this session truly enjoyable.

20
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,201
Welcome to CU Geyser.

21
00:01:56,339 --> 00:01:59,306
Wow! This place is so romantic!

22
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:01,670
Then you get to enjoy it with us.

23
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:03,374
All three of us?

24
00:02:04,055 --> 00:02:05,598
You are a lucky man.
