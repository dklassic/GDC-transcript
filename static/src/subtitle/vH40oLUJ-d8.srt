00:00:06,902 --> 00:00:13,289
All right. Hi. Welcome to our talk, More Feelings, Fewer Features, Showcasing Your Indie Game Through

2
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:20,597
Messaging and Video. I'm Dana Trebella. I'm the founder of Spoken Wheels Strategy. I do marketing,

3
00:00:20,797 --> 00:00:22,900
PR, and strategy for games.

4
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:27,035
I founded Spoken Wheel about four and a half years ago,

5
00:00:27,175 --> 00:00:30,157
but I've been doing marketing and PR for games

6
00:00:30,277 --> 00:00:33,399
for the last seven-ish years.

7
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:35,421
I work on games of all different sizes

8
00:00:35,501 --> 00:00:36,902
across all different platforms,

9
00:00:37,022 --> 00:00:39,604
and these are just some of the games that I've worked with.

10
00:00:40,745 --> 00:00:42,426
All right, and my name is Derek Liu,

11
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,288
and I'm a game trailer editor.

12
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:46,129
I've been doing this for about five years now,

13
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,231
some in AAA games,

14
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:50,753
but now full-time doing trailers for indie games.

15
00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:54,714
Before then, I was an editor for about ten years, and these are some of the things that

16
00:00:54,734 --> 00:00:55,154
I've worked on.

17
00:00:56,935 --> 00:01:02,756
So we're going to talk first about what is messaging, why you need a good message, some

18
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:07,817
common mistakes that we see a lot, things you should do, some examples of good messaging,

19
00:01:08,517 --> 00:01:13,038
some exercises to help you find your message, and then finish up with some lessons and takeaways.

20
00:01:13,919 --> 00:01:20,200
So first, the reason we're doing this talk is we're often the first people to know that

21
00:01:21,645 --> 00:01:23,386
don't know how to talk about their games,

22
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:25,746
like especially late in the development cycle.

23
00:01:26,306 --> 00:01:29,467
And people frequently hire one of us, but not the other.

24
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:31,487
And we've also run into situations

25
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:33,447
where we were both hired for one project,

26
00:01:33,487 --> 00:01:35,668
but we didn't find out we were both on the project

27
00:01:35,768 --> 00:01:36,648
until it was over,

28
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,588
because we were never put in communication.

29
00:01:39,088 --> 00:01:40,429
Which we think is kind of weird,

30
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:42,609
because PR and marketing and trailers,

31
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:43,469
they're not separate.

32
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:46,450
You should think of them as this thing that go together,

33
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,810
because when they're really cohesive,

34
00:01:50,262 --> 00:01:51,583
just the message is much stronger.

35
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:54,285
And we solve a lot of the same problems,

36
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:55,646
but through different means.

37
00:01:56,727 --> 00:01:57,987
But first, let's talk a little bit

38
00:01:58,548 --> 00:02:00,649
about just what is messaging.

39
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,352
Messaging is just the hook, the secret sauce,

40
00:02:04,432 --> 00:02:06,953
the elevator pitch, the sort of one-line sentence

41
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:08,354
which describes your game.

42
00:02:08,955 --> 00:02:13,258
But more importantly, messaging is how you talk

43
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:14,839
to people about your game.

44
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:17,501
Like I said, I've had lots of clients

45
00:02:17,761 --> 00:02:19,762
who they come to me for a trailer.

46
00:02:20,188 --> 00:02:21,868
And I say, okay, what's special about your game?

47
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,629
And they're like, ugh.

48
00:02:26,269 --> 00:02:27,510
I'm like, you should work on that first.

49
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,830
But it's really important.

50
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,691
It really drives how you talk about your game

51
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:35,312
to friends or Twitter, press, streamers, publishers,

52
00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:38,293
and also how you talk to yourself about your game.

53
00:02:39,273 --> 00:02:41,193
And if the message is how you talk about your game,

54
00:02:41,874 --> 00:02:44,274
the trailer is how you show people your game.

55
00:02:44,814 --> 00:02:47,075
Because trailers communicate through visuals,

56
00:02:47,215 --> 00:02:48,095
sound, and music.

57
00:02:48,555 --> 00:02:52,577
It works together with the messaging to just form what people just know about your game

58
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:54,538
and also how to share it with other people.

59
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:58,421
And some key components of your message in your trailer include...

60
00:02:59,862 --> 00:03:01,843
Okay, so when you're thinking about your message,

61
00:03:02,063 --> 00:03:05,385
a core component of your message should really be the experience.

62
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:08,387
So yes, that's like what you do in the game,

63
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:11,849
but more importantly, that's what do people get from your game

64
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:14,471
that they literally can't get from anywhere else.

65
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:17,633
That's kind of why your game is special in the first place.

66
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:22,022
Similarly, we're going to talk about some feelings.

67
00:03:22,142 --> 00:03:22,842
I love feeling.

68
00:03:23,423 --> 00:03:26,605
So ultimately, people play games for the feelings

69
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:27,666
that they get from them.

70
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:30,708
And your game should make people feel something.

71
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,431
Feelings are also what stay with people the longest

72
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:36,132
after they've played.

73
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:40,175
So once you've got this great message that

74
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:42,077
communicates the experience and the feelings,

75
00:03:42,117 --> 00:03:44,198
you can also communicate it in your trailer.

76
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:47,992
So why do you need a good message?

77
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:50,433
So we're all hearing about how many games

78
00:03:50,513 --> 00:03:52,975
are launching regularly, and we all

79
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:55,797
know that it's really, really hard to distinguish yourself

80
00:03:56,097 --> 00:03:57,558
in the marketplace today.

81
00:03:58,558 --> 00:04:00,580
Without a good message, it's just really hard

82
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,121
for people to remember or find your game

83
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:04,442
or tell people about it.

84
00:04:05,923 --> 00:04:07,004
So why else?

85
00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:10,326
Your messaging also focuses your marketing.

86
00:04:11,448 --> 00:04:16,232
Yes, it can be kind of complicated to find a really good message, but once you find it,

87
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:21,437
I promise you it's going to make your life so much easier and simpler because it serves

88
00:04:21,597 --> 00:04:27,302
essentially as this central focus of everything that you put out into the world. So, like,

89
00:04:27,342 --> 00:04:31,465
if you're thinking about sending something out, you can ask yourself, does this align with my

90
00:04:31,525 --> 00:04:36,269
message that I want people to know? And that can just be an easy clue as to what you should

91
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:37,310
actually be putting out there.

92
00:04:38,722 --> 00:04:40,865
Your message is also your filter for marketing.

93
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:45,791
So just like in development, constraints are really great,

94
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:47,953
that also can be true for marketing too.

95
00:04:48,314 --> 00:04:50,416
So again, it kind of provides this lens

96
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:52,919
to decide what you're putting out into the world.

97
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,822
And all of your marketing materials

98
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:56,964
should really help to communicate this message.

99
00:04:58,452 --> 00:04:59,734
So we touched on this a little bit,

100
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:03,017
but your message helps people share and advocate

101
00:05:03,077 --> 00:05:03,598
for your game.

102
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:06,601
So players really love to share the games that they find,

103
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:07,602
that they're excited about.

104
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:10,385
They love to be the first to tell other people about a game.

105
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:14,730
But they really need a clear and concise and easy way to do it.

106
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,673
So if you give them that, that's super helpful.

107
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:21,056
And if there's no clear message, then sometimes,

108
00:05:21,598 --> 00:05:25,709
Either people will make something up, which may or may not be what you want them to say,

109
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:30,121
or if it feels really daunting and stressful, they just might not talk about your game at all.

110
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:34,185
So your message is super important.

111
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:35,545
It affects all of these things.

112
00:05:35,605 --> 00:05:37,765
And this is just kind of like a basic list.

113
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:43,207
But essentially, it should be cohesive and across all

114
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:44,407
of these different things.

115
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:47,948
So people are actually more likely to remember things

116
00:05:48,088 --> 00:05:49,948
if they see them over and over again.

117
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:53,569
And people are also more likely to like them

118
00:05:53,989 --> 00:05:55,830
if they see them over and over again too.

119
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,470
So it's super important to do that.

120
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:02,435
So Derek's going to talk a little bit about some marketing faux pas.

121
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:05,676
Okay. Yeah. So without a clear and unique message,

122
00:06:06,036 --> 00:06:09,177
your game kind of doesn't sound any different from everything else out there.

123
00:06:09,237 --> 00:06:12,658
For example, all of these games share these things in common.

124
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:17,240
And if they wanted to, they could have led with these five bullet points here.

125
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,841
But that wouldn't have really distinguished them in any way.

126
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:23,922
And, you know, maybe it could have worked in the trailers

127
00:06:24,482 --> 00:06:26,403
because their art style is very strong.

128
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:30,978
But what if we just took away all the art and just left these bullet points?

129
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:32,999
This is what it would kind of look like.

130
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:38,984
You know, like, if you look at these, would you think to yourself, oh, that game!

131
00:06:40,746 --> 00:06:42,207
I know exactly what game that is.

132
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,331
So it's really important, the words that you use.

133
00:06:47,011 --> 00:06:49,874
Now fortunately, that's not what they did.

134
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:55,478
For example, Rogue Legacy made a really big point of the descendants and they all have

135
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:58,986
kind of different attributes when you die.

136
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:01,467
And then dead cells went really big on like,

137
00:07:01,507 --> 00:07:03,188
this is hard, you will die,

138
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:06,028
and also just talking about how good it is to play.

139
00:07:06,048 --> 00:07:10,250
And then also enter the gungeon went just really big

140
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:13,511
on like guns and there's bullets and the bullets have guns

141
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:14,691
and they shoot you with bullets.

142
00:07:14,771 --> 00:07:18,272
And flint hook went and highlighted it's a grappling hook

143
00:07:18,332 --> 00:07:20,673
and the pirate part and looting.

144
00:07:21,653 --> 00:07:23,994
And then binding of Isaac.

145
00:07:24,492 --> 00:07:27,393
went really heavy on atmosphere and sense of dread.

146
00:07:27,753 --> 00:07:30,094
And a lot of its trailers didn't even have gameplay.

147
00:07:30,874 --> 00:07:33,636
And then just to, again, clarify the strength of good messaging,

148
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:36,697
just look at the same style of boring text,

149
00:07:37,297 --> 00:07:39,498
but with language for very specific games.

150
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,560
See, when you look at these now, these probably all

151
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,361
remind you of certain games, because it's very, very specific.

152
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:51,263
And these could only be used with a lot of these games

153
00:07:51,283 --> 00:07:52,003
that they're from.

154
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:56,114
And now let's get into some common mistakes.

155
00:07:57,235 --> 00:07:58,055
Okay, cool.

156
00:07:58,095 --> 00:07:59,796
So let's talk a little bit about the things

157
00:07:59,836 --> 00:08:01,617
that I see all the time.

158
00:08:02,677 --> 00:08:07,440
So the first is, don't describe your game using other games.

159
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,601
So the thing that I get most frequently

160
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:12,662
when I ask people to tell me about their game

161
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,064
is like, my game is if X and Y had a baby,

162
00:08:16,284 --> 00:08:17,825
or like the thing we have here is like,

163
00:08:18,105 --> 00:08:20,306
it's the Dark Souls of Animal Crossing.

164
00:08:20,722 --> 00:08:23,103
So here's why this is a bad idea.

165
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,905
First of all, it requires that your audience

166
00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:28,806
is familiar with those games.

167
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:32,088
If they're not, then you've probably already lost them.

168
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:35,830
Let's say that they are.

169
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:41,652
Well, then they probably have a preconceived notion associated

170
00:08:41,712 --> 00:08:42,093
with it.

171
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:44,994
And let's say they love those games, right?

172
00:08:45,014 --> 00:08:48,416
Then you're setting the bar pretty high for what

173
00:08:48,476 --> 00:08:49,976
your game needs to live up to.

174
00:08:51,526 --> 00:08:56,949
Also, if your game does elicit a comparison, then players really like to find that on their own,

175
00:08:57,469 --> 00:09:01,411
and you're often kind of like robbing them of that easter egg that they can get.

176
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:06,694
But most importantly, like, we're all really used to hearing this in a game's context,

177
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:11,176
but if you take it out of a game's context, then it kind of really doesn't make sense.

178
00:09:11,236 --> 00:09:14,738
So if someone said to you, like, tell me about yourself,

179
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,801
hopefully you wouldn't respond and be like, I'm my mom and my dad.

180
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:21,171
Right?

181
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:23,873
Like, I really hope you would give yourself

182
00:09:23,933 --> 00:09:27,434
a characteristic, so do that with games also.

183
00:09:29,796 --> 00:09:31,557
So we already hit on this a little bit,

184
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:33,498
but a features list is important,

185
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:34,678
but it's a features list.

186
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:35,999
It's not your message.

187
00:09:36,999 --> 00:09:39,861
People ultimately aren't playing games just

188
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:42,923
for this features list, and tons of games

189
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:44,343
have really similar features.

190
00:09:44,443 --> 00:09:47,925
So it's not really differentiated at all.

191
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:53,375
don't rely on just game lingo and genre.

192
00:09:53,435 --> 00:09:55,177
So a lot of times when I ask people,

193
00:09:55,277 --> 00:09:56,999
tell me about your game, I get something like,

194
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:01,923
it's an immersive first person shooter, which is like, okay.

195
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:04,926
And right, like there's a lot of those.

196
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:08,449
So yes, it can be part of your message,

197
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,511
but it really should not be the whole thing.

198
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,033
So with lingo in particular,

199
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:15,115
sometimes it can feel really inaccessible.

200
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,249
People don't necessarily know what those words mean.

201
00:10:18,609 --> 00:10:21,030
And it also can only kind of box you

202
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,591
in to reach a really specific audience that just may or may

203
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:25,491
not be your target.

204
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:27,792
With genre, I actually think this

205
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:30,593
is a bit more problematic, because people

206
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:32,953
have really, really preconceived notions of what

207
00:10:33,053 --> 00:10:34,034
each genre should be.

208
00:10:34,094 --> 00:10:36,994
Like, if you think about a roguelike or an RPG

209
00:10:37,014 --> 00:10:40,355
or any kind of genre, people have specific ideas

210
00:10:40,395 --> 00:10:41,176
of what that should be.

211
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:44,517
And if your game kind of veers outside of that at all.

212
00:10:44,984 --> 00:10:46,605
then that can make people unhappy,

213
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:49,448
and no one likes unhappy people on the internet.

214
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,872
It's also just, again, not differentiated.

215
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:56,695
Like, yes, some genres are more popular

216
00:10:56,815 --> 00:10:57,977
or have their day in the sun.

217
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:00,879
But there's lots of games in every genre,

218
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,841
so why should people play yours?

219
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:05,864
So let's talk about some do's.

220
00:11:07,289 --> 00:11:08,711
Work on your message early.

221
00:11:09,371 --> 00:11:11,113
As soon as you've got a viable idea

222
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:12,535
that you're super excited about,

223
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:14,336
start putting together a message

224
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:16,298
and a clear way to talk about your game.

225
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:18,981
It can be a really, really good tool

226
00:11:19,342 --> 00:11:21,724
to just see if people are getting your game

227
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:23,185
and if they're excited about it

228
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,707
and to kind of take the temperature

229
00:11:24,987 --> 00:11:26,569
on how the idea is resonating.

230
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:30,980
So this is one a lot of people I think don't think about,

231
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,021
but your message can actually help you guide the design.

232
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:38,902
So we've all seen a Steam trailer or something like that

233
00:11:38,962 --> 00:11:42,303
and then been like, wait, this doesn't feel like that game

234
00:11:42,343 --> 00:11:42,863
at all.

235
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:46,164
There's a big disparity in how the screenshots

236
00:11:46,244 --> 00:11:48,825
or the trailers are presenting versus what the game actually

237
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:49,085
is.

238
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:51,406
But if you think of your message early

239
00:11:51,506 --> 00:11:55,487
and you use that as a checkpoint while you're designing the game,

240
00:11:55,887 --> 00:11:58,288
then this disparity can be caught early.

241
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:05,587
And if you have a message that you want to share, then you can make sure that you're reflecting that in the design or

242
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:07,728
go back and kind of iterate on your message.

243
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:11,390
Which to the next point, iterate on your message.

244
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:17,796
So yes, you want a cohesive message that goes across all of those things that we showed earlier,

245
00:12:18,317 --> 00:12:23,801
but ultimately before you get there, you want to try some stuff and see what's resonating with people.

246
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:28,544
So at conventions, with your friends, on Twitter, nothing super formal,

247
00:12:28,644 --> 00:12:31,326
but just kind of test it out and see what people are digging.

248
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,090
describe the game's experience.

249
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,831
So think in terms of the color, the flavor, the tone,

250
00:12:38,871 --> 00:12:39,751
and the feelings.

251
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,112
Ultimately, the experience is really

252
00:12:42,612 --> 00:12:45,914
the subtext and the heartbeat of what a game is.

253
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,874
And again, most importantly, it's

254
00:12:47,914 --> 00:12:49,755
like, what are people getting from your game

255
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:52,736
that they just literally can't get anywhere else?

256
00:12:53,376 --> 00:12:55,237
So a lot of times when I ask this question,

257
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:57,718
I get the response like, it's a horror game,

258
00:12:58,098 --> 00:13:00,819
or something very shallow like that.

259
00:13:01,575 --> 00:13:06,937
Um, but what if you could answer something like, oh, it's the hellish nightmare of waking

260
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:11,399
up over and over to discover that it's finals day and you've missed the whole semester.

261
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:14,140
Um, or as an example, like

262
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:17,358
with Boyfriend Dungeon, they could have just called the game

263
00:13:17,638 --> 00:13:18,559
a dungeon crawler.

264
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,923
But instead, they say, romance your swords,

265
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:24,585
capture the hearts of cuties, and level them up

266
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:28,149
in this shack and slash dungeon crawling adventure, which

267
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:30,492
is so much more colorful because you

268
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:33,855
get an idea for the feel of the game, the overarching tone,

269
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:35,016
and the experience.

270
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:38,380
All right, and also.

271
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:40,509
when you're working on your game,

272
00:13:40,609 --> 00:13:43,330
you should show people video of your game being played.

273
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,131
And I'm not talking about play testing.

274
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:47,052
I'm talking about just taking video

275
00:13:47,152 --> 00:13:48,353
and showing it to someone.

276
00:13:48,473 --> 00:13:50,114
Their hands aren't on the controllers,

277
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:52,155
so they actually can't test things around

278
00:13:52,535 --> 00:13:53,456
to see what's going on.

279
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:56,858
And then this will really help you find out

280
00:13:57,158 --> 00:13:59,579
if your game's visual communication is really strong

281
00:13:59,659 --> 00:14:00,420
or if it's really weak.

282
00:14:02,701 --> 00:14:05,262
Because if people watch the video of your game,

283
00:14:05,282 --> 00:14:06,983
they're like, so what do you do?

284
00:14:07,143 --> 00:14:08,404
Then you know, oh crap.

285
00:14:09,272 --> 00:14:11,033
that is not coming across.

286
00:14:11,913 --> 00:14:14,154
And this is really important down the line

287
00:14:14,274 --> 00:14:17,795
for trailers and GIFs and YouTube and Twitch streaming

288
00:14:17,835 --> 00:14:20,176
because you're in a lot of trouble

289
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:22,277
if you're posting all these things on social media

290
00:14:22,497 --> 00:14:24,498
to hype things up and then no one knows

291
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:26,219
what's going on in any of the footage.

292
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:30,720
Another tip is just tell the player what they'll do,

293
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:30,840
which

294
00:14:32,296 --> 00:14:34,837
I'm thinking like bird's eye level of what you're doing in the game.

295
00:14:34,897 --> 00:14:36,757
Like what is the goal or the objective?

296
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:39,738
Not talking about like, oh, you double jump and you fireball things.

297
00:14:40,818 --> 00:14:45,220
It could be something like you're trying to survive in this water planet and build a rocket

298
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,180
to escape the planet.

299
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,381
Or you're trying to find out what happened to your family in your creepy Pacific Northwest

300
00:14:51,421 --> 00:14:52,422
house.

301
00:14:52,442 --> 00:14:54,482
Or you're a goose and you just want to be a jerk.

302
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:57,883
And your trailer will help you flesh this out.

303
00:14:59,004 --> 00:15:00,424
But having the basic premise...

304
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:05,072
established for people, just really helps prime them to know what they're going to expect

305
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,053
from the rest of your game.

306
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,475
The other tip is just keep your description short.

307
00:15:09,715 --> 00:15:13,458
One to four sentences, you know, brief and colorful is ideal.

308
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,759
Get to the point quickly.

309
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,523
Because if you just kind of drone on for a little bit too long, then it can kind of be

310
00:15:20,563 --> 00:15:24,645
like if someone's talking to you about their dream that they have and people will be like,

311
00:15:24,665 --> 00:15:26,126
okay, I don't really care anymore.

312
00:15:26,738 --> 00:15:29,619
And it just really has to get to the heart of what people care about,

313
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:31,420
which is what they do in the game and why.

314
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,982
And also, the message doesn't have to be everything about the game,

315
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:38,283
and it really, really should not be everything,

316
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:41,464
because you need to leave people wanting a little bit more.

317
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:43,865
Just imagine if you're at a convention,

318
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:46,186
and you tell them your spiel.

319
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:47,587
You want them to be like,

320
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:49,408
oh, cool, I'm going to wait in line and play the demo.

321
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,288
But if you tell them everything,

322
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:54,210
then it might be enough information for them to be like,

323
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:56,705
Huh, yeah, I think I know exactly what your game is.

324
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,066
No, that's not my thing.

325
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:00,087
But you kind of like leave it a little bit vague,

326
00:16:00,107 --> 00:16:02,048
and you're like, hmm, that sounds interesting.

327
00:16:02,248 --> 00:16:04,550
I will wait in line, or I'll go read some articles.

328
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:09,813
And also, these tips are good for your trailer.

329
00:16:10,313 --> 00:16:11,113
Basically the same thing.

330
00:16:11,574 --> 00:16:14,215
Make it short, get to the point, focus on the hook,

331
00:16:14,775 --> 00:16:16,276
and once you kind of get past the hook,

332
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:18,017
then you can focus on the other things,

333
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,878
maybe which kind of overlap other games.

334
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,360
And then, of course, you want to leave them wanting more,

335
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,480
so they'll actually buy the game.

336
00:16:24,406 --> 00:16:27,427
And as an example of how that can translate into a trailer,

337
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:28,887
this idea of just focusing on the hook,

338
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:31,088
is, so this is a game I worked on,

339
00:16:31,128 --> 00:16:32,148
Way of the Passive Fist,

340
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:35,149
which is a brawler all about parrying attacks,

341
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:37,509
and then you kind of nudge them over when they're tired.

342
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,550
But more than that, for this trailer,

343
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,950
I just wanted to convey the idea

344
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,611
that you're this sort of untouchable kung fu master

345
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:45,512
who just defends effortlessly,

346
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:48,072
and just completely dominates the enemies.

347
00:16:48,873 --> 00:16:49,813
And it's kind of like, if you...

348
00:16:50,614 --> 00:16:52,975
watch like the end of the Matrix or the tea house scene

349
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:54,155
in Crashing Tiger, Hidden Dragon,

350
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:56,395
where there's kind of fighting people off with one hand.

351
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:57,936
I just wanted to show this.

352
00:16:58,376 --> 00:16:59,896
And then for like the middle of the trailer,

353
00:16:59,956 --> 00:17:01,857
then I kind of expand on the gameplay ideas,

354
00:17:01,917 --> 00:17:05,078
show a little bit of variety and then show like the bosses.

355
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:08,358
And then by the end, I just kind of wanted to bring it

356
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:10,239
all the way back to the central idea

357
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,679
about being this untouchable Kung Fu master,

358
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,020
where we just have this kind of final pairing montage

359
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,781
just to show that you're this immovable object.

360
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:21,997
And then, so yeah, this is just one example

361
00:17:22,158 --> 00:17:24,020
of going in hard on one idea,

362
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:25,902
but next, Dana has some examples

363
00:17:26,203 --> 00:17:27,625
of some messaging that she's worked on.

364
00:17:29,687 --> 00:17:29,888
Okay.

365
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:34,047
Cool, so this is an example for the game Old Man's Journey.

366
00:17:35,527 --> 00:17:38,509
Usually, we would just lead with the first sentence,

367
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:41,470
which is, Old Man's Journey, a soul-searching puzzle

368
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,711
adventure, tells a story of life, loss, precious moments,

369
00:17:44,851 --> 00:17:46,712
and changed plans.

370
00:17:46,852 --> 00:17:48,833
I think that this one worked well for us,

371
00:17:48,933 --> 00:17:50,854
because just in this sentence, you

372
00:17:50,894 --> 00:17:53,435
get an idea of the color of the game.

373
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:54,295
You can tell that it's.

374
00:17:55,069 --> 00:17:58,492
probably narratively driven, that there's some emotions,

375
00:17:59,052 --> 00:18:00,654
and you get a little bit of an idea

376
00:18:00,694 --> 00:18:02,816
of kind of what you'll do.

377
00:18:02,836 --> 00:18:06,439
The next couple sentences we would use

378
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,880
either where appropriate

379
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,602
or when people wanted more information,

380
00:18:10,082 --> 00:18:11,723
which were shape the landscape

381
00:18:11,763 --> 00:18:13,745
to create the old man's path forward.

382
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:17,609
Experience heartache and hope

383
00:18:17,709 --> 00:18:19,370
as you embark on a heartfelt journey

384
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,012
through a sun-kissed world.

385
00:18:21,926 --> 00:18:28,748
So these lines essentially show you a little bit about the mechanics, which was really unique for this game.

386
00:18:28,788 --> 00:18:36,189
It also talks about the art using this word sun-kiss, which I think is really appropriate and kind of beautiful for the game.

387
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:43,651
And you learn a lot just about the experience and how you'll feel and the tone of the game just from really like a couple of sentences.

388
00:18:45,251 --> 00:18:48,852
So this one, hold down, a delightful ball bouncing spectacle.

389
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:50,452
So this is five words.

390
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:53,597
And it's simple, it's snappy, it's succinct.

391
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:57,298
And the game was pretty simple and catchy and snappy.

392
00:18:57,358 --> 00:19:00,759
So there's really no need to make it complicated

393
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:01,760
if it doesn't need to be.

394
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,900
But just in these words, I think you

395
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,441
get an idea for the feeling you should get while playing,

396
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:12,383
kind of what you do in the game, and the experience of it

397
00:19:12,523 --> 00:19:12,943
overall.

398
00:19:14,305 --> 00:19:17,267
Okay, and then I worked on the story trailer

399
00:19:17,307 --> 00:19:18,488
for this game Heaven's Vault,

400
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:20,730
which is a new game by Inkle, who made 80 Days.

401
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,572
And so they made the announced trailer by themselves,

402
00:19:24,712 --> 00:19:26,474
and then they brought me in for the story trailer.

403
00:19:27,094 --> 00:19:29,256
And I asked them, what should the new trailer show?

404
00:19:29,316 --> 00:19:30,317
And the things they mentioned

405
00:19:30,517 --> 00:19:31,838
were actually these three things,

406
00:19:32,078 --> 00:19:33,899
which were what the announced trailer focused on.

407
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,581
Open world adventure, every choice matters,

408
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:37,762
and decipher language.

409
00:19:38,963 --> 00:19:40,324
And I listened to that, and I thought,

410
00:19:40,404 --> 00:19:42,846
okay, one of those things sounds interesting to me.

411
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:44,671
which was the decipher language,

412
00:19:44,691 --> 00:19:46,471
because I've never done that in the game.

413
00:19:47,492 --> 00:19:51,212
So for the story trailer, we decided just focus only on that

414
00:19:51,412 --> 00:19:53,113
and we kind of expanded from there.

415
00:19:53,213 --> 00:19:54,793
So we have like history as a science,

416
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,233
you're an archeologist, decipher language,

417
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:58,474
and you put together history.

418
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:01,494
Whereas like open world adventure and every choice matters,

419
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03,014
it kind of describes the how

420
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:05,515
and it's like the very video gamey aspect.

421
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:08,375
And this trailer, we really wanted to focus on the what

422
00:20:08,695 --> 00:20:11,716
and the why, which is kind of like the higher level view.

423
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,791
And I don't know if I can take full credit,

424
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:17,431
but the trailer was well received,

425
00:20:17,772 --> 00:20:19,952
and a lot of the articles that came out afterwards

426
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:22,673
really talked a lot about being an archaeologist

427
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:23,654
and translating language.

428
00:20:24,494 --> 00:20:26,715
And next, we just want to share some games we thought

429
00:20:26,755 --> 00:20:27,955
that have very strong messages.

430
00:20:27,975 --> 00:20:32,417
All right, Sunless Skies,

431
00:20:32,577 --> 00:20:35,878
sail the stars, betray your queen, murder a son.

432
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:40,080
Superhot, the FPS where time moves only when you move.

433
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:43,687
Neocab, an emotional survival game.

434
00:20:44,988 --> 00:20:47,069
Firewatch, a mystery set in the Wyoming wilderness

435
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:49,031
where your only emotional lifeline is the person

436
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:50,832
on the other end of a handheld radio.

437
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:55,255
Minute, a peculiar little adventure played in 60 seconds.

438
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:59,098
And Papers, Please, a dystopian document thriller.

439
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,883
Okay, so we've now told you what to do, what not to do.

440
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:08,105
We've given you some examples and you're probably like,

441
00:21:08,714 --> 00:21:09,918
Cool, but how do I do this?

442
00:21:10,459 --> 00:21:12,606
So we're gonna walk through some exercises

443
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,832
which ultimately are just questions

444
00:21:14,912 --> 00:21:16,376
that I recommend starting with.

445
00:21:16,904 --> 00:21:19,606
and really thinking through to help you find your message.

446
00:21:20,347 --> 00:21:22,648
So the first one is, what are the emotions

447
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:24,150
that you want the player to feel?

448
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,332
So a lot of times when I ask this question,

449
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:28,574
I get the answers fun or nostalgic,

450
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:31,696
which are kind of like, again, really shallow words,

451
00:21:31,756 --> 00:21:34,098
not really saying much and sort of generic.

452
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:36,540
So think of like richer words here.

453
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,462
Some good examples would be words like,

454
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:43,726
infuriated, alive, uncertain of the future, skeptical of the people around you.

455
00:21:44,406 --> 00:21:47,749
You really want to go deep and be super specific to your game.

456
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:54,934
How would you describe the experience of playing the game? A lot of times for this one, I get fun

457
00:21:54,954 --> 00:21:58,697
and I get an escape, which, like, I know you're all going to be shocked,

458
00:21:58,757 --> 00:22:01,319
but that's a lot of the reason that people play games anyway.

459
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:05,421
So some good examples here would be things like,

460
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:07,163
the first feeling of being in love,

461
00:22:07,223 --> 00:22:08,965
the awkwardness of being a teenager,

462
00:22:10,086 --> 00:22:12,268
reminded of times in your life when you've had regrets,

463
00:22:12,368 --> 00:22:13,510
kind of things like that.

464
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,175
What makes this game different, really?

465
00:22:18,495 --> 00:22:20,057
And I add the really because again,

466
00:22:20,117 --> 00:22:22,379
I get a lot of like, uh, uh.

467
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:28,444
like struggles here, but if you can't answer this question, then it's a really good idea to like go

468
00:22:28,504 --> 00:22:33,889
back and potentially either iterate on your game idea or to actually spend some real time thinking

469
00:22:33,929 --> 00:22:38,593
about this. This is again, ultimately, why is your game different than everything else out there?

470
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:44,339
What did you create that's like totally uniquely yours? And how can you describe that in a way to

471
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:46,581
people that's understandable and accessible?

472
00:22:48,195 --> 00:22:51,478
So these next two are probably my favorite questions,

473
00:22:52,158 --> 00:22:54,320
which is, can you describe your game in three words?

474
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,881
So this sounds easy, but it's hard

475
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:59,863
because I'm going to challenge you to not use any words

476
00:22:59,923 --> 00:23:03,766
that you would like to, like 2D, 3D, satisfying, fun,

477
00:23:04,506 --> 00:23:09,570
adventure, roguelike, epic, unique, anything like that.

478
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,711
And then that will help you actually

479
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:14,513
kind of get to the heart of what your game really is.

480
00:23:17,251 --> 00:23:19,333
What are you most proud of about the game that you're making?

481
00:23:20,374 --> 00:23:23,137
I like this one a lot because it often really reveals

482
00:23:23,738 --> 00:23:26,801
where the soul is of the game and what you've really

483
00:23:26,841 --> 00:23:29,243
put a lot of care and attention into.

484
00:23:29,704 --> 00:23:34,529
So this can be the sound, the music, the art, the design,

485
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:36,571
anything involving the game.

486
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:39,414
And it can often be a really good jumping off point

487
00:23:39,434 --> 00:23:40,895
for what your message should focus on.

488
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,382
Why were you motivated to make this game in the first place?

489
00:23:45,442 --> 00:23:48,143
So there's so many ideas that you could have made,

490
00:23:48,223 --> 00:23:49,524
but you picked this one.

491
00:23:50,244 --> 00:23:52,746
So what told you that this was a game worth making

492
00:23:53,406 --> 00:23:55,407
and that you were so excited about it

493
00:23:55,447 --> 00:23:57,628
that you just had to see it come to fruition?

494
00:23:57,648 --> 00:24:01,731
All right, in this exercise, just keep asking why.

495
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:04,432
Basically just be your own inner five-year-old.

496
00:24:04,792 --> 00:24:07,074
We just won't stop asking you why.

497
00:24:07,094 --> 00:24:08,715
You know, why is this interesting?

498
00:24:09,142 --> 00:24:09,922
Well, because of this.

499
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,203
Why is that interesting?

500
00:24:11,343 --> 00:24:12,304
Well, because of this.

501
00:24:12,604 --> 00:24:13,305
Why is that interesting?

502
00:24:13,345 --> 00:24:14,426
Just keep on going.

503
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:17,608
Just see how deep you can go and what you come up with.

504
00:24:18,469 --> 00:24:19,910
And then Dana mentioned a lot of these,

505
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:22,552
but just a lot of these words, you should just avoid them

506
00:24:22,632 --> 00:24:25,074
because pretty much everyone uses them,

507
00:24:25,655 --> 00:24:27,716
which means everyone's saying the same thing,

508
00:24:28,197 --> 00:24:29,237
which if you don't use them,

509
00:24:29,317 --> 00:24:30,638
then you'll be different from everyone else.

510
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:33,661
So yeah, just take a picture of that.

511
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:34,962
But.

512
00:24:37,062 --> 00:24:38,203
So then when you have your message,

513
00:24:38,583 --> 00:24:40,364
you have to think about how to incorporate it

514
00:24:40,384 --> 00:24:42,806
into a trailer, which is a whole topic unto itself.

515
00:24:43,626 --> 00:24:46,088
But my main tip is just focus on the hook

516
00:24:46,428 --> 00:24:49,510
as much as possible and forget everything else

517
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,251
which makes your game similar to others.

518
00:24:51,632 --> 00:24:53,493
And if there's time, then you get to that.

519
00:24:55,234 --> 00:24:56,755
Because I think a lot of people are just afraid

520
00:24:57,015 --> 00:24:59,217
of putting the thing that is new first.

521
00:24:59,237 --> 00:24:59,817
And they're like, oh, you know,

522
00:24:59,857 --> 00:25:01,158
I'll put the things that they know about.

523
00:25:01,558 --> 00:25:03,799
But it makes it a lot less interesting to see in a trailer.

524
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:04,940
For example.

525
00:25:06,203 --> 00:25:09,985
And yet, also try to show the idea without spelling it out.

526
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:13,267
If you have to use text,

527
00:25:13,788 --> 00:25:16,670
like, it's probably not as good of an idea.

528
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,391
Just try to have your trailer have no text

529
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:20,512
as much as you can,

530
00:25:21,373 --> 00:25:23,334
and then people will just remember it much more

531
00:25:23,414 --> 00:25:26,796
than if they have to kind of read exactly what the game is.

532
00:25:27,116 --> 00:25:28,577
And the other thing is, like, in a trailer,

533
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:31,139
you have all these sorts of unique tools at your disposal.

534
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:32,940
You have game capture, you have editing,

535
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,461
you have music, all these ways.

536
00:25:34,954 --> 00:25:35,594
other than words.

537
00:25:35,654 --> 00:25:37,816
And if a picture is worth a thousand words,

538
00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:40,177
then just don't put so many in the trailer.

539
00:25:41,878 --> 00:25:44,539
Okay, let's go on to some lessons and takeaways.

540
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,461
Again, messaging, it's a key part of the process.

541
00:25:48,622 --> 00:25:50,463
Do it early, check it often.

542
00:25:50,823 --> 00:25:53,104
It should be one of the very first things that you do.

543
00:25:53,904 --> 00:25:55,785
And it's often the first experience

544
00:25:55,825 --> 00:25:57,887
that people have with your game, just hearing about it.

545
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:02,509
Messaging simplifies by providing constraints and focus.

546
00:26:02,609 --> 00:26:04,730
If you find that clear, concise message.

547
00:26:05,116 --> 00:26:07,837
It just makes the marketing process and design process,

548
00:26:07,897 --> 00:26:10,237
telling people about your game, a lot less daunting.

549
00:26:10,537 --> 00:26:14,779
So you won't be kind of caught with nothing to say

550
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:15,739
when people say, what's your game?

551
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:18,299
And you'll also feel more confident

552
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:19,300
about why your game is special,

553
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,420
which will get people excited.

554
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,221
And then always refer back to your message.

555
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:24,701
It's your guide, it's your roadmap

556
00:26:24,741 --> 00:26:26,702
for all your marketing, all these things.

557
00:26:27,022 --> 00:26:28,942
The more cohesive, the more likely folks

558
00:26:29,122 --> 00:26:31,003
are to remember it and repeat it.

559
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:33,870
Cool.

560
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,232
So workshop your message.

561
00:26:35,272 --> 00:26:39,396
You are at GDC, which is a great place to test and try out

562
00:26:39,436 --> 00:26:40,457
your message on people.

563
00:26:41,237 --> 00:26:43,780
But also, like other conventions, Twitter, forums,

564
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,842
all good places to gauge the temperature.

565
00:26:47,343 --> 00:26:49,245
Show people video of your game early.

566
00:26:49,345 --> 00:26:51,547
So yes, of course, be strategic with it.

567
00:26:51,627 --> 00:26:54,390
But again, an excellent gauge on if people

568
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:57,172
are understanding what the experience or flavor is

569
00:26:57,312 --> 00:26:59,014
of your game, and if it's resonating.

570
00:27:00,628 --> 00:27:03,830
And please, coordinate your messaging and your videos.

571
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,312
They're much more powerful and impactful

572
00:27:06,472 --> 00:27:08,753
if they go together and tell the same story.

573
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:11,514
Thanks.

574
00:27:12,795 --> 00:27:12,855
Woo!

575
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:12,935
Woo!

576
00:27:12,955 --> 00:27:13,035
Woo!

577
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:13,115
Woo!

578
00:27:13,135 --> 00:27:13,195
Woo!

579
00:27:13,215 --> 00:27:13,275
Woo!

580
00:27:13,295 --> 00:27:13,375
Woo!

581
00:27:20,379 --> 00:27:20,439
Woo!

582
00:27:20,459 --> 00:27:20,519
Woo!

583
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:21,680
Do we have time for questions?

584
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:23,021
Okay.

585
00:27:23,061 --> 00:27:23,241
Yeah.

586
00:27:23,701 --> 00:27:23,801
Oh.

587
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:25,062
A little time.

588
00:27:25,442 --> 00:27:26,743
Please line up at the microphones.

589
00:27:27,463 --> 00:27:28,484
Got like three minutes.

590
00:27:28,624 --> 00:27:29,084
Talk fast.

591
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:37,661
Hello. Something I found really interesting that you're talking about is shaping your message to as concisely a message that you can.

592
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:47,226
Do you have any recommendations for creating different versions of that message depending on who you're talking to or making it one sentence versus three sentences?

593
00:27:47,246 --> 00:27:49,087
Yeah.

594
00:27:51,596 --> 00:27:53,537
I think, I mean, that's a really good question.

595
00:27:53,597 --> 00:27:54,758
That's a good thing to do.

596
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,961
I mean, I would say generally with like social media,

597
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:00,842
you want to be super short and succinct.

598
00:28:01,022 --> 00:28:04,044
I would say similarly with like a website,

599
00:28:04,064 --> 00:28:05,365
you want to have a one-liner.

600
00:28:05,445 --> 00:28:08,006
Like, I think it's always a good idea to have just a one-liner

601
00:28:08,167 --> 00:28:09,667
that's easy, simple.

602
00:28:09,928 --> 00:28:12,089
You can always say it out of your mouth and then to have.

603
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:15,007
two to three more sentences, you can tack on.

604
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:19,272
And I also think that certain places, like a press kit,

605
00:28:19,372 --> 00:28:20,473
you can be more verbose.

606
00:28:20,693 --> 00:28:22,635
But anything that's a first line of defense,

607
00:28:22,715 --> 00:28:23,616
I'd make super short.

608
00:28:23,856 --> 00:28:24,857
OK, thank you.

609
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:29,602
No questions?

610
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:30,923
You're all total wizards.

611
00:28:33,466 --> 00:28:33,746
OK, cool.

612
00:28:34,427 --> 00:28:35,528
Thanks for coming.

613
00:28:35,568 --> 00:28:36,029
I guess that's it.

614
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:36,309
Thanks.
