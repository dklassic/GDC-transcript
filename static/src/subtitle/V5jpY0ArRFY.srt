00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:12,224
Hi there and welcome to the art to key art.

2
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:14,706
How great key art can lead to doubling marketing numbers.

3
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:18,850
I'm Alex Van Lep and I am here to guide you through this presentation.

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,923
I have been in the industry for over 10 years, and specifically for the last 8 years I've

5
00:00:24,923 --> 00:00:27,445
been involved with indie game marketing.

6
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:33,208
Currently I'm the marketing director at video game publisher Graffiti Games, and I'm also

7
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:35,929
a partner at marketing agency Vimglobal.

8
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:43,203
So this talk is going to share the effectiveness of good key art and why your studio should

9
00:00:43,203 --> 00:00:48,307
invest in money and resources to ensure that your banners are attracting and converting

10
00:00:48,307 --> 00:00:51,650
people into visits, wishlists, and ultimately sales.

11
00:00:52,405 --> 00:00:55,989
I'll share examples of key art that Graffiti Games produced

12
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,694
from the past year, what we did, the numbers and results

13
00:00:59,694 --> 00:01:04,159
that we got, and then also, particularly with Steam,

14
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,583
how to make sure you're doing what you can do

15
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:10,486
to have a banner that really converts people

16
00:01:10,486 --> 00:01:11,948
into wishlists and sales.

17
00:01:13,077 --> 00:01:18,448
Everything draws from my experience and then also from the data insights that I've found

18
00:01:18,448 --> 00:01:23,278
from the past couple years when I had an idea to start tracking cure effectiveness.

19
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:26,684
So what is KeyArt?

20
00:01:26,684 --> 00:01:29,385
I'm sure most of you already know what KeyArt is,

21
00:01:29,385 --> 00:01:30,766
but for those that don't,

22
00:01:30,766 --> 00:01:33,126
it's a virtual representation of your game.

23
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:36,988
Think of it as a billboard for your game.

24
00:01:36,988 --> 00:01:39,128
Often it is used for store pages,

25
00:01:39,128 --> 00:01:41,549
so your Steam capsule banners,

26
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,250
for your thumbnails for trailers.

27
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,851
for media in a press kit, for your social media channels.

28
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:51,831
It's used in many different ways.

29
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:54,432
But I think the most significant is for store pages

30
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,853
because that's oftentimes the first way someone

31
00:01:57,853 --> 00:01:59,373
sees your game.

32
00:01:59,373 --> 00:02:01,174
And I do feel that key art is probably

33
00:02:01,174 --> 00:02:03,934
the most significant marketing tool that you have

34
00:02:03,934 --> 00:02:07,195
because it's often the first line where

35
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:08,375
someone sees your game.

36
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:13,376
in order to get attention from consumers, media, streamers,

37
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,517
first parties, publishers, whoever

38
00:02:16,517 --> 00:02:19,677
you're trying to get your game out in front of.

39
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:22,298
Particularly with stores, there are tons of games

40
00:02:22,298 --> 00:02:25,658
launching every day, thousands every year.

41
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:27,919
You want to be able to stand out in the store

42
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,279
because maybe that's the only chance someone ever

43
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:34,220
sees your game is through the key art.

44
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,440
And if you're not standing out, you're

45
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,700
just going to get passed by.

46
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:43,651
Now I want to go over some key art basics and to start with a good piece of key art,

47
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:48,473
which is this Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion art. As you can tell, it's high quality.

48
00:02:48,473 --> 00:02:53,936
It's easy to read the logo. It explains the game some. It's not exactly, oh, this is him

49
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:59,298
committing tax evasion, but it's a little tongue in cheek. You'd see the different characters.

50
00:02:59,298 --> 00:03:04,940
You see Turnip Boy, the titular character in the middle there with money around him.

51
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,301
And I particularly like

52
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:10,863
that the focus of all the other characters and that your eye is drawn to the center

53
00:03:10,863 --> 00:03:16,287
where the character and the logo are. That way someone right away sees what the game is

54
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:24,611
instead of having to search for a piece of logo that they can know what the game is.

55
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:29,014
For this instance, the colors are really nice and bright too.

56
00:03:29,014 --> 00:03:32,176
It doesn't always have to be that way, but I do like it for here.

57
00:03:34,387 --> 00:03:38,149
Now, the main reason, as I've already kind of touched on,

58
00:03:38,149 --> 00:03:39,949
is to invest in your key art,

59
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:42,210
is just to stand out among the crowd.

60
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,352
The visibility in the store is huge.

61
00:03:45,352 --> 00:03:47,313
Because well-crafted key art

62
00:03:47,313 --> 00:03:50,694
will lead to a successful game launch.

63
00:03:50,694 --> 00:03:52,075
Since 2019, we've seen any time

64
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:55,016
that we invested in key art at Graffiti Games.

65
00:03:55,797 --> 00:03:59,279
that it resulted in doubling our marketing numbers.

66
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:00,920
And we didn't have an artist on staff,

67
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,382
so we always outsourced that.

68
00:04:02,382 --> 00:04:05,824
So it was really good to invest in that money

69
00:04:05,824 --> 00:04:10,627
and that time that it does take to create a key art.

70
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:13,749
Ultimately, you're gonna increase your store-ability

71
00:04:13,749 --> 00:04:17,552
by converting people who see it in the store into visitors.

72
00:04:17,552 --> 00:04:19,994
So for instance, in this image here,

73
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:22,055
I took this from a STEAM festival.

74
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:25,997
You can see the cure is what you see first in a store.

75
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:28,986
I like the robot in the middle.

76
00:04:28,986 --> 00:04:30,766
I like the colors.

77
00:04:30,766 --> 00:04:34,307
I like how clear it is and easy it is to read.

78
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:37,068
And the character is cute, so it makes

79
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,969
me want to know more about this game.

80
00:04:39,969 --> 00:04:44,090
And this ultimately will lead to me clicking on it.

81
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,751
When you're in a store and you see this,

82
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:48,931
people are just going off of what they see first.

83
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:51,032
And so you've got to be cognizant of that.

84
00:04:52,452 --> 00:04:57,175
This is important because in the back end with Steam, you'll have impression numbers,

85
00:04:57,175 --> 00:05:02,418
and that's anytime someone sees your key art. So whether it's in a festival like this,

86
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:08,562
or it's on a more like this in another game's page, whether someone's on your page,

87
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:15,125
or even in upcoming titles or searching there, that all counts as impressions, which is great,

88
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:18,827
but it doesn't lead to the ultimate goal of getting wishlists and sales.

89
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:27,574
So you really want to convert people and good key art will make people want to click and go to your page.

90
00:05:27,574 --> 00:05:33,838
And then ultimately, if they're invested in that and you have a great page, you can then convert people into wishlists and sales.

91
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:41,003
So key art serves as that catalyst to get people to your page and to convert them into wishlists and sales.

92
00:05:41,003 --> 00:05:44,486
And you're not just going to be using it in the store page, as I mentioned.

93
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:51,274
You'll use it as a trailer thumbnail on Twitter, other social media channels, Reddit, and so you

94
00:05:51,274 --> 00:05:55,959
want to have that great key art that then will push people to your page in other areas too.

95
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:03,666
And here it is in the wild. So in this blue fire example, top left, you see it as a trailer thumbnail.

96
00:06:04,425 --> 00:06:08,689
And that's even to get people to view your trailer, because oftentimes people just see

97
00:06:08,689 --> 00:06:14,414
that first thumbnail and that makes them decide whether or not they want to click on the game.

98
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:20,159
On the bottom left, you have Twitter background banner, again to create that community.

99
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:23,663
And on the right is a Steam small capsule.

100
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:29,624
which is really important and I'll touch base more on it later because with this small capsule

101
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:34,385
it's red at such a small size you really want to make sure your art is high quality legible

102
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:38,827
and clear and can present the game. It's a bit tougher because it's smaller to

103
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:45,868
to show a good representation but it's really really important that you work on it

104
00:06:45,868 --> 00:06:48,409
and you have a good piece of art and we'll touch on it more.

105
00:06:49,996 --> 00:06:54,781
And it isn't just launch where you need to work on your key art.

106
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:59,225
Uh, I recommend after launch, uh, updating it, uh, to let people know about

107
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:02,868
sales, promotions, DLC events.

108
00:07:02,868 --> 00:07:05,671
Let's say you're leaving early access.

109
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:09,935
You're at 1.0, you're going to, you know, 1.2 or whatever you want to call it.

110
00:07:09,935 --> 00:07:10,055
Uh,

111
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:14,258
it's really important to let people know that, hey, there's something different with the game.

112
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:19,941
In this blue fire example here on the right side, we were featured as a Steam Daily Deal.

113
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:24,503
And so we knew we were going to be on the front page and we wanted to convert our wish list,

114
00:07:24,503 --> 00:07:29,826
but also attract new customers. So what we did is we added a little banner at the bottom

115
00:07:29,826 --> 00:07:36,530
to call out the 35% off 48 hours in order to catch people's eyes. Did a different color,

116
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,131
same kind of font, but that different color pops up.

117
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:41,432
really, really nice against it.

118
00:07:41,432 --> 00:07:45,194
And in the Steam backend, it's great in the graphical assets section.

119
00:07:45,194 --> 00:07:49,756
You can actually do an asset override.

120
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:52,357
So instead of having to replace every piece of key art,

121
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:56,579
you do an override where you upload your new key art, you set the schedule.

122
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:59,600
For instance, this was 48 hours. We had it set for 48 hours.

123
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,301
And then once the sales over or whatever promotion is over,

124
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:08,742
then it automatically reverts back to the original key art.

125
00:08:08,742 --> 00:08:11,603
So it's no, not having to replace it

126
00:08:11,603 --> 00:08:12,643
and then replace it again.

127
00:08:12,643 --> 00:08:14,584
It just automatically does it.

128
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:17,364
And if you want to keep at it, you know,

129
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:20,465
you can do as many overrides as possible.

130
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:25,006
As far as I've seen, I have not done more than a handful,

131
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:27,607
but it is a really good tool that will help save you time.

132
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:38,197
Now I'm going to go into some do's and don'ts before we even go into our results because

133
00:08:38,197 --> 00:08:43,163
I think it's really important to understand what makes great key art, what doesn't make good key

134
00:08:43,163 --> 00:08:48,949
art and you know what you can do to make sure you're producing really high quality art.

135
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:56,899
So as I've been mentioning, you'll want to find a focal point, ideally around the center

136
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:00,101
with a logo, with the main character.

137
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:08,008
For instance, in this blue fire example, the logo and the character Umbra, they are together

138
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:12,452
and your eyes kind of drawn there through the action of the rest of the characters,

139
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:13,673
but also that he's front and center.

140
00:09:15,234 --> 00:09:22,059
I recommend investing in your key art, whether you're hiring an artist to produce it for you,

141
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:25,982
or you're just doing the research, you know, research other key art that you like,

142
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:31,006
other banners that you think are good. And that's going to help you form a direction you want to go.

143
00:09:31,006 --> 00:09:36,371
And it doesn't have to be from video games, either. You could take it from movies, you can

144
00:09:36,371 --> 00:09:40,634
take it from any artwork that you think is really cool and would fit within your game.

145
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:47,983
For Blue Fire, we actually were inspired by Star Wars posters as a way to create this poster,

146
00:09:47,983 --> 00:09:55,888
and ultimately we came upon this theme. And then that research will help you with an artist,

147
00:09:55,888 --> 00:10:01,812
too, because if you hire someone, it helps give them direction, it helps do mock-ups,

148
00:10:01,812 --> 00:10:05,314
and it'll make the process go a lot more smoother and a lot faster.

149
00:10:06,845 --> 00:10:12,446
I know people don't always have artists on staff and so they have to hire an artist such as us,

150
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:18,027
but it's really important that you do and that you don't skimp out because like I said,

151
00:10:18,027 --> 00:10:23,049
it's really important to have good key art that will attract people's attention and it

152
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:27,270
will pay you back like I said. With us, we saw our numbers double

153
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,470
time and time again whenever we invested in good key art.

154
00:10:30,977 --> 00:10:35,422
And as I showed you on the last slide, update your key art.

155
00:10:35,422 --> 00:10:39,265
In this instance, we started giving out a free soundtrack

156
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:40,527
to coincide with a sale.

157
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:42,389
And so we brought that into the banner.

158
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:46,793
It's just always good to keep the community knowing any time

159
00:10:46,793 --> 00:10:49,175
you have DLC or any other update.

160
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:51,217
And then lastly, think about banner sizes,

161
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:54,921
because you're going to have to create quite a bit.

162
00:10:54,961 --> 00:11:00,042
of them. And I'll touch on that in the next couple slides. And then for the small capsule,

163
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:06,203
I always recommend creating original art because it's not really good to take your main key art

164
00:11:06,203 --> 00:11:10,984
and scale it down. And again, I'm going to touch about on that a little bit more in the upcoming

165
00:11:10,984 --> 00:11:23,307
slides. So when you're looking to create a key art, think about the horizontal and vertical

166
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:24,067
dimensions.

167
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:30,023
When we were updating the key art for Graffiti's upcoming game, Nira,

168
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:33,506
we made this graph here to show, OK, this

169
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:35,928
is what would be in the vertical, and this

170
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:39,351
is what would be in the horizontal images.

171
00:11:39,351 --> 00:11:42,434
This gives you an idea because, OK, I

172
00:11:42,434 --> 00:11:44,015
know I can move elements around.

173
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:46,642
With the store pages, some of them

174
00:11:46,642 --> 00:11:48,683
might actually have you do both vertical

175
00:11:48,683 --> 00:11:50,203
and horizontal dimensions.

176
00:11:50,203 --> 00:11:53,524
So you want to be able to move elements easily.

177
00:11:53,524 --> 00:11:56,085
One, it helps save your time.

178
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:58,205
And two, then with your artist,

179
00:11:58,205 --> 00:12:00,306
it helps keep the theme overall.

180
00:12:00,306 --> 00:12:04,467
So here you can see we did a horizontal position

181
00:12:04,467 --> 00:12:08,848
and we have open space for the vertical position.

182
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:12,793
All we have to do is just move around some elements such as the llama on the right,

183
00:12:12,793 --> 00:12:14,355
the totem on the left,

184
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:18,360
and it can all fit in within that vertical because we kept that center the same.

185
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,621
And that's what you want to do.

186
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:23,746
You want to keep that center essentially the same and just be able to move around

187
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:26,810
items because again, not just with store pages.

188
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,912
your QR is going to live in other areas. For instance, on Twitch, it's always great to have

189
00:12:31,912 --> 00:12:36,174
an image there. That's a vertical image. So if you only create a horizontal image,

190
00:12:36,174 --> 00:12:43,598
it's not going to work. You're going to have to try to crop it and it may not work out very well.

191
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:47,440
Here's what it looked like, the image looked like in the actual Steam page.

192
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,121
So this is the horizontal image there. You know.

193
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:58,073
moved the totem a little bit there to work within the sizing on Steam, but overall really good.

194
00:12:58,073 --> 00:13:02,455
And then here's what it looked like with a small capsule, again another horizontal,

195
00:13:02,455 --> 00:13:08,278
but still had to move some elements around. And then for Twitch, it was a vertical position,

196
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:13,219
and you can see that the elements are basically the same, just some items moved. We even took

197
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:17,741
the llama out of the vertical just because it didn't fit within it, but it doesn't take away

198
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:18,302
from the game.

199
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,081
Now some don'ts.

200
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:26,765
So graffiti has not always been the best at creating key art.

201
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,446
Whenever someone's starting out, you're not

202
00:13:28,446 --> 00:13:29,627
going to be masters at it.

203
00:13:29,627 --> 00:13:30,628
And it takes time.

204
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:34,571
And especially, you've got to find the right artist

205
00:13:34,571 --> 00:13:37,253
to produce great key art.

206
00:13:37,253 --> 00:13:39,474
So big thing, don't have illegible text,

207
00:13:39,474 --> 00:13:42,016
and characters, and graphical elements.

208
00:13:42,016 --> 00:13:45,639
Too small, blurry, especially with the small capsule,

209
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,240
it's going to make your life.

210
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:52,306
horrible because people aren't gonna click on it or see it. You know, don't use low res,

211
00:13:52,306 --> 00:13:57,752
always make sure your art is high res, don't have too many visual elements, you know,

212
00:13:57,752 --> 00:14:01,316
it's just hard to decipher. I like to keep...

213
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:07,396
small capsule elements between two and three for that reason. And I like to be more on the minimal

214
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:12,741
side as long as it tells a story. When you start adding too many elements, people's eyes start to

215
00:14:12,741 --> 00:14:19,367
wonder. You never have a physical, you know, focal point that people will see.

216
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:22,209
And then don't limit your logo to one place.

217
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:24,551
That's a really, really big one

218
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:27,813
because when you're resizing for the different stores,

219
00:14:27,813 --> 00:14:30,315
as I mentioned, you're gonna have vertical,

220
00:14:30,315 --> 00:14:31,756
you're gonna have horizontal,

221
00:14:31,756 --> 00:14:33,197
it's gonna make your life a hell

222
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:37,019
because you are going to then have to move

223
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,661
every single graphical element

224
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:42,743
in order to make sure that the banners look well.

225
00:14:42,743 --> 00:14:44,204
And don't do that to yourself.

226
00:14:44,204 --> 00:14:44,845
Make it easy.

227
00:14:44,845 --> 00:14:46,286
You don't have time for it,

228
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,307
especially if you wanna update your...

229
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:56,804
key art for sales or promotions after launch. You just want to make your life easy.

230
00:14:56,804 --> 00:15:01,232
And like I said, it's just a mess. This example here by the bullet.

231
00:15:02,197 --> 00:15:07,680
This was one of our games and its piece of art was not good when we first created it.

232
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,804
One, the logo text is really difficult to read.

233
00:15:12,804 --> 00:15:14,605
I can't tell you how many times someone said,

234
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:19,669
I bite the bullet seeing this because they thought it was the game's name,

235
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,789
even though it's bite the bullet.

236
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:26,013
The logo is stuck in the one spot because you have so many graphical elements around it.

237
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:27,814
If you move it just a little bit up,

238
00:15:27,814 --> 00:15:29,815
a little bit left, a little bit down.

239
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:32,578
you're going to be blocking one of the characters.

240
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:35,401
And then there's just too many characters in it.

241
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:39,685
So your eye just kind of wanders all over.

242
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:41,006
It's not really good.

243
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:44,830
Luckily, we did create some new art for launch that helped out.

244
00:15:46,526 --> 00:15:51,028
Now I keep talking about small capsules and it's because it's something I think is really important

245
00:15:51,028 --> 00:15:57,451
and I feel that people often don't think about and graffiti didn't think about so much in the

246
00:15:57,451 --> 00:16:04,694
past either. These are four great examples of of QR that we've done and I'll dive a little bit more

247
00:16:04,694 --> 00:16:10,837
into why it's great to have good small capsule QR which of all your QR I think is the most

248
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:13,778
important because it's often what people will see in a store.

249
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:18,217
So I keep talking about creating original key art

250
00:16:18,217 --> 00:16:19,978
for the small capsule.

251
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:24,340
And that's because it's really hard to take a 16 by nine

252
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,882
key art and reduce it to a small capsule.

253
00:16:26,882 --> 00:16:29,443
A lot of times people do this, but it doesn't work out

254
00:16:29,443 --> 00:16:32,265
because that key art is meant to be seen at a larger size.

255
00:16:32,265 --> 00:16:35,527
When you shrink it, the text becomes illegible.

256
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,468
You can't really see the elements.

257
00:16:37,468 --> 00:16:40,850
And so people just kind of see colors

258
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,611
when they're going through.

259
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:48,274
Don't use only text for a small capsule because you're trying to give an impression of what your game is.

260
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:52,717
So when it's only text, no one has any idea what your game is.

261
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:59,101
Unless you're some huge title and you can just say your name and people know what you are.

262
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,461
But chances are that's not your game, that's not our games.

263
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:06,623
So you need to give a little bit of elements.

264
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:10,905
So again, clear and readable, legible.

265
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:13,486
That's what the main key are, small capsules too.

266
00:17:13,486 --> 00:17:15,387
And then, as I mentioned before,

267
00:17:15,387 --> 00:17:17,308
limit the graphical elements.

268
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:20,932
I like to keep it to around two or three with a logo.

269
00:17:20,932 --> 00:17:22,935
There's no real set rule.

270
00:17:22,935 --> 00:17:24,536
It's just my personal preference

271
00:17:24,536 --> 00:17:28,741
and what I think has worked out well for us.

272
00:17:28,741 --> 00:17:30,723
And I think it would work out well with you too.

273
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:35,629
And you can take elements from your main key art

274
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:37,751
in order to make a small capsule.

275
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:38,592
I'll show you how to do that.

276
00:17:40,058 --> 00:17:45,161
So here we took an existing turnip boy commits tax evasion vertical key art.

277
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:47,063
We actually made a vertical and horizontal.

278
00:17:47,063 --> 00:17:48,163
So we had two original ones.

279
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:51,333
Not everyone's going to have that luxury, but we did.

280
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,774
And I noticed that when looking at this,

281
00:17:53,774 --> 00:17:55,856
there was an empty space next to Turnip Boy

282
00:17:55,856 --> 00:17:59,297
because we were trying to come up with a new small capsule.

283
00:17:59,297 --> 00:18:02,439
So I thought, hey, if we take that, put the logo next to it

284
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:05,501
because Turnip Boy running with some money,

285
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,662
and you see the logo, nice and easy,

286
00:18:07,662 --> 00:18:10,324
him committing tax evasion, that tells you a story.

287
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:12,325
He's running away.

288
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:12,745
It's clear.

289
00:18:12,745 --> 00:18:13,565
It's readable.

290
00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:16,327
And then when we made this, we saw a really good

291
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:17,508
click-through increase.

292
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:24,654
So that's one way you can make a small capsule from your existing art.

293
00:18:24,654 --> 00:18:31,040
Another way is just to move around elements as needed in order to fit for a good small capsule.

294
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:34,786
And then here's kind of what our small capsule,

295
00:18:34,786 --> 00:18:36,388
the evolution of it was.

296
00:18:36,388 --> 00:18:38,750
So on the top left, you had our original one,

297
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,092
which had a great cast of characters there.

298
00:18:41,092 --> 00:18:44,835
But when you see it in a small version in the Steam page,

299
00:18:44,835 --> 00:18:46,897
it's really hard to read the logo

300
00:18:46,897 --> 00:18:50,940
and some of the characters you're not seeing as well.

301
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,863
So because of that, then on the upper right,

302
00:18:53,863 --> 00:18:56,545
we just did the logo with the character,

303
00:18:56,545 --> 00:18:58,026
but it doesn't really tell a story.

304
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:04,551
Sure, the name alone tells you a lot about what the game is, but you still need a little

305
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:05,572
bit more.

306
00:19:05,572 --> 00:19:09,395
And on the bottom, as I showed you, that's what we ultimately came up with.

307
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:10,576
And I really like it.

308
00:19:10,576 --> 00:19:12,177
I think it's a good representation.

309
00:19:12,177 --> 00:19:16,800
And as I said, it really did a great job of

310
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,022
increasing our click throughs on Steam.

311
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:24,627
And I really believe because the game performed really well at launch,

312
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:27,289
being a top 10 Steam game for about two and a half weeks.

313
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:31,552
Part of that is because people saw that small capsule on the Steam homepage

314
00:19:31,552 --> 00:19:35,796
in the new and trending section and just kept clicking on it

315
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:38,758
because they kept thinking, oh, this is I really like this art.

316
00:19:38,758 --> 00:19:41,720
This is cool. It's already a trending game.

317
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,501
And so it can help.

318
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:47,449
continue that momentum from launch and keep you going and going. We didn't anticipate to be in

319
00:19:47,449 --> 00:19:51,917
that section for two and a half weeks, but I do think the key art was a good source of that.

320
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:58,609
Now I know, as I said, not everyone's going to have an artist on staff.

321
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:03,371
And so when you are outsourcing your key art, here's some guidelines

322
00:20:03,371 --> 00:20:04,452
or some tips to help you.

323
00:20:04,452 --> 00:20:07,413
So first determine your budget.

324
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:08,493
Again, don't skimp.

325
00:20:08,493 --> 00:20:10,094
It's not going to do good.

326
00:20:10,094 --> 00:20:11,815
You're not going to get a good result.

327
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:16,737
You will want to invest your money into producing key art.

328
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:21,499
Uh, and so with that, once you know your budget, you know who you can afford.

329
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:23,851
And then who do you find?

330
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:25,012
Well, ask your network.

331
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,433
That's what we did.

332
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:27,874
When we found our artists,

333
00:20:27,874 --> 00:20:29,356
we just asked developers we knew,

334
00:20:29,356 --> 00:20:31,257
we asked other publishers,

335
00:20:31,257 --> 00:20:33,459
we asked friends, partners,

336
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:35,701
and they gave us options.

337
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,142
And then from there,

338
00:20:37,142 --> 00:20:39,384
we went with the people who we thought were really good

339
00:20:39,384 --> 00:20:41,245
and matched our aesthetic for our games.

340
00:20:41,245 --> 00:20:44,087
Obviously, you can find someone who's a great artist

341
00:20:44,087 --> 00:20:45,008
and they do great key art,

342
00:20:45,008 --> 00:20:47,811
but if it doesn't match what your game is and feel,

343
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:49,232
maybe it's not the best fit.

344
00:20:49,872 --> 00:20:52,134
You can also search sites such as ArtStation.

345
00:20:52,134 --> 00:20:56,719
That's where we browsed our artists' portfolios beforehand

346
00:20:56,719 --> 00:20:58,300
to see if it would be a good fit.

347
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,942
And then you can check social media.

348
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:01,063
There are people there, too.

349
00:21:01,063 --> 00:21:05,306
And as I mentioned, you want to start early because, one,

350
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,609
it takes a while to find an artist because you don't

351
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:10,211
know people's availability.

352
00:21:11,472 --> 00:21:14,675
they might have other jobs coming up.

353
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:15,996
So, you know, you might be able to start it

354
00:21:15,996 --> 00:21:19,599
and then have to pause and then start again.

355
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:20,780
And it just takes time.

356
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,463
With Blue Fire, I showed you,

357
00:21:23,463 --> 00:21:25,424
it took us two months to revise that key art

358
00:21:25,424 --> 00:21:28,887
because people's availabilities, feedback,

359
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:29,828
it just takes time to do it.

360
00:21:29,828 --> 00:21:31,410
And if you do it right,

361
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,653
you're gonna spend quite a bit of time.

362
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,232
And then have a direction and an idea.

363
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:40,833
I talked about that before,

364
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,513
but it'll help the artist then come up

365
00:21:42,513 --> 00:21:43,614
with a couple of mock-ups.

366
00:21:43,614 --> 00:21:46,556
And then from there, you can give them feedback

367
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:48,056
and start getting in the right direction

368
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,077
of what you want your key art to be.

369
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:51,018
But examples really help.

370
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,199
And then an idea of like,

371
00:21:53,199 --> 00:21:55,180
okay, what kind of story do I want to tell?

372
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,581
What do I want to convey when people see this?

373
00:21:57,581 --> 00:22:00,903
And then down the line, when you finalize your key art,

374
00:22:00,903 --> 00:22:04,105
make sure that you get the needed file sizes from them.

375
00:22:05,266 --> 00:22:09,131
You can't get every single one because it's difficult.

376
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:11,554
You never know what certain stores might want down the line

377
00:22:11,554 --> 00:22:13,757
but for Steam, you have those guidelines.

378
00:22:13,757 --> 00:22:15,339
You can see what you'll need.

379
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:18,103
But that's why you want to also obtain the source file

380
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:21,687
because by doing that, you can make any updates later on.

381
00:22:22,128 --> 00:22:25,389
alterations, resizing for different stores,

382
00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:26,469
editing for marketing purposes.

383
00:22:26,469 --> 00:22:29,030
You know, I told you about the post launch.

384
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,531
And also if you just wanna tinker around with it

385
00:22:31,531 --> 00:22:33,132
a little bit, you know, do trial and error

386
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:35,973
and see what works and what's getting people to click

387
00:22:35,973 --> 00:22:38,934
and go to your page, that source file is gonna be helpful

388
00:22:38,934 --> 00:22:42,695
because you don't know what someone's availability is

389
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,416
to do it again, work on it again later.

390
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:47,237
And it just saves you time and energy.

391
00:22:49,942 --> 00:22:52,424
So here I'm going to dive into our first case study, which

392
00:22:52,424 --> 00:22:54,025
is Blue Fire.

393
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:56,387
It launched this year in January.

394
00:22:56,387 --> 00:23:00,350
And it was a top 10 Steam and eShop game.

395
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:04,513
And I really feel that the key art played a big factor in this.

396
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:08,055
And it just is really awesome key art.

397
00:23:08,055 --> 00:23:10,477
And I think based off of the numbers,

398
00:23:10,477 --> 00:23:15,981
you'll see where it came from and what it ended up being.

399
00:23:15,981 --> 00:23:17,803
Really, the key art played a role.

400
00:23:24,156 --> 00:23:29,403
So just to give some background about the game, it initially was announced as a Nintendo Indie

401
00:23:29,403 --> 00:23:34,289
World title. It was actually the first game shown during the event in March of 2020. So we started

402
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:41,058
out with some great media and consumer buzz, but unfortunately, part of that event, we couldn't

403
00:23:41,058 --> 00:23:42,360
actually launch the Steam version.

404
00:23:42,993 --> 00:23:44,674
It was Nintendo only.

405
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:48,516
And so we had all this awesome coverage and consumer

406
00:23:48,516 --> 00:23:52,859
attention, but no real place to send people,

407
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:56,441
nowhere besides Discord and Twitter.

408
00:23:56,441 --> 00:23:58,483
And that only increased so much.

409
00:23:58,483 --> 00:24:01,424
Ultimately, a few months later, we

410
00:24:01,424 --> 00:24:04,026
were part of IGN Summer of Gaming event,

411
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,887
and that's where we launched the Steam page.

412
00:24:05,887 --> 00:24:09,830
And so we actually started off with a really good number

413
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,750
to start our campaign.

414
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:16,880
But ultimately, the numbers decreased, they slowed down, and went pretty stagnant.

415
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:20,023
And I think part of that was because of the key art.

416
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:23,245
When we were pushing organically on social media, on Reddit,

417
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:25,867
it just wasn't getting people there and people weren't clicking on it

418
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:27,268
in the store itself.

419
00:24:27,268 --> 00:24:33,492
And so because of this, I was like, we need to update our key art

420
00:24:33,492 --> 00:24:35,834
because a game with this much media and consumer attention

421
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:38,736
should not be having this much of an issue,

422
00:24:38,736 --> 00:24:42,799
getting people to wish lists and even just getting visitors to the page.

423
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:53,073
So with the art, on the top left, you can see what the old main key art used to be.

424
00:24:53,073 --> 00:25:00,139
And it's okay. It's not amazing. The problem is, is that it's just not very clear, readable.

425
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:05,623
It doesn't really present what the game is about. The characters seem blurry. Part of that is our

426
00:25:05,623 --> 00:25:12,209
problem because we want it to be mysterious. But by doing so, you don't actually know what's going

427
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:14,891
on. Everything's kind of in silhouette, and it just...

428
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,301
doesn't really tell you, hey, this is Blue Fire.

429
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:20,621
This is what the game is about.

430
00:25:20,621 --> 00:25:25,902
You're fighting these monsters, these characters.

431
00:25:25,902 --> 00:25:28,343
So ultimately, it needed changing.

432
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:31,424
And then the red for a game called Blue Fire,

433
00:25:31,424 --> 00:25:33,845
that kind of confused some people, too.

434
00:25:33,845 --> 00:25:36,005
And that's why on the bottom left,

435
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:38,126
we created this new key art, which is

436
00:25:38,126 --> 00:25:39,546
a great depiction of Blue Fire.

437
00:25:39,546 --> 00:25:42,307
You can see the main character there, Umbra.

438
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,408
He's got his swords out in an action pose.

439
00:25:44,408 --> 00:25:45,028
There's

440
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:52,464
Lots of action going on from the other enemies, from the characters, just even reading a book

441
00:25:52,464 --> 00:25:54,905
there he's in an action pose.

442
00:25:54,905 --> 00:25:59,648
Everything gets pushed to the center where Umbra is and the logo is so people know right

443
00:25:59,648 --> 00:26:00,849
away what the game is.

444
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:06,803
And we did keep one character in the middle top a bit blurry and mysterious,

445
00:26:06,803 --> 00:26:11,667
because that's the main boss. So we want to keep some sort of elements of mystery still in it,

446
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:16,271
and which you can do as long as you make everything else clear and easily defined.

447
00:26:16,271 --> 00:26:20,375
Once we did that, man, our numbers increased a ton.

448
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:23,357
And I'll go into those results in the next couple pages.

449
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:28,799
On the right side, you can see the before and after of the small capsule.

450
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,322
Now that first one on the top there, just the logo with a blurry background.

451
00:26:34,296 --> 00:26:37,458
That, as I said, text only does not work.

452
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:39,739
Personally, I wouldn't click on this

453
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:42,480
because it doesn't tell me anything about the game.

454
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,281
And it's just not clear either, even just with the logo.

455
00:26:45,281 --> 00:26:50,164
It's still kind of blurry and I would just skip over it.

456
00:26:50,164 --> 00:26:52,885
And so we came up with the one on the bottom right.

457
00:26:52,885 --> 00:26:54,866
As our small capsule, we took the Umbra pose,

458
00:26:54,866 --> 00:26:56,707
because you have that action.

459
00:26:56,707 --> 00:26:57,427
And then we...

460
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:04,583
made it more readable, more legible. We moved the logo a bit so we cut it into two instead of it

461
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:09,684
being just straight one. And that fits where you can then add a you know one graphical element with

462
00:27:09,684 --> 00:27:14,965
the umbra there and then have the Bluefire logo and then you can see there's a bit of a background

463
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:20,487
too. And all that really works well especially when you're seeing it at a smaller size because

464
00:27:20,487 --> 00:27:23,547
in a store page this would probably be

465
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:26,349
half this size, a third of this size.

466
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:31,472
So you really wanna make sure things are clear and legible.

467
00:27:31,472 --> 00:27:33,533
Now, I wanna go into some numbers.

468
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:36,614
And then this is comparing a random week

469
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:40,216
during before and after we did the KeyArt change.

470
00:27:40,216 --> 00:27:43,218
So the chart on the left, that's before the KeyArt change

471
00:27:43,218 --> 00:27:46,180
and the chart on the right is after the KeyArt change.

472
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:49,722
And I chose two weeks that didn't have any marketing beats,

473
00:27:49,722 --> 00:27:51,202
that didn't have anything else going on.

474
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:53,023
There were no other changes.

475
00:27:53,184 --> 00:27:59,168
because I wanted to compare when it's organic searches, so people what they see through Steam

476
00:27:59,168 --> 00:28:04,972
and social media, Reddit, those areas, and the numbers from it. So you can see on the left,

477
00:28:04,972 --> 00:28:10,376
we had a pretty good click-through rate from our impressions, but it wasn't really translating

478
00:28:10,376 --> 00:28:15,519
into Wispos per day, so we were getting nine per day, which for a game that had a lot of consumer

479
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:16,760
buzz and media attention,

480
00:28:17,937 --> 00:28:19,238
it didn't really make sense.

481
00:28:19,238 --> 00:28:21,980
And so I, again, I think people just weren't clicking on it.

482
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,822
Even if they were seeing it in the store,

483
00:28:23,822 --> 00:28:25,343
they weren't clicking on it,

484
00:28:25,343 --> 00:28:28,605
or they just were seeing the then main key art

485
00:28:28,605 --> 00:28:31,167
after clicking on a capsule key art,

486
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,369
and then just being like, yeah, this game is not for me.

487
00:28:34,268 --> 00:28:40,331
On the right, you can see the impressions are virtually the same, but our click-through rate doubles.

488
00:28:40,331 --> 00:28:47,194
And we had an awesome 60 percent. And our wishes per day increased to 25. So almost three times as

489
00:28:47,194 --> 00:28:54,317
many afterwards. Our visitors more than doubled too. And that's to me showing people were seeing

490
00:28:54,317 --> 00:29:00,180
this image, this key art, and they were clicking on it at a higher rate, especially in the store

491
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,801
to see what Blue Fire was like.

492
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:10,573
And then ultimately, they were converting into visitors and wishlists and at launch then into sales.

493
00:29:10,573 --> 00:29:18,278
So, you know, it's really important to have that good cure because, as you can see here, you're we're doubling our numbers.

494
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:19,238
And that's what you want.

495
00:29:19,238 --> 00:29:23,140
You want those numbers, especially your wishlist numbers, to increase.

496
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:31,147
And here's a chart that shows our visitors from when we launched the steam page until

497
00:29:31,147 --> 00:29:31,948
the end of November.

498
00:29:31,948 --> 00:29:36,293
As you can see in the very beginning, that's when we had the IGN event.

499
00:29:36,293 --> 00:29:43,140
And we started off pretty good, but then things stagnate for a bit, except for a couple little

500
00:29:44,026 --> 00:29:45,847
marketing beats here and there.

501
00:29:45,847 --> 00:29:49,389
But then we changed the art right around early October,

502
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:52,311
just prior to the Steam Autumn Festival

503
00:29:52,311 --> 00:29:54,252
and the Mixed October event.

504
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:57,554
And you can see our visitor numbers just increased a ton.

505
00:29:57,554 --> 00:30:01,757
And then also the fact that we had way more visits

506
00:30:01,757 --> 00:30:03,418
during those marketing beats and afterwards

507
00:30:03,418 --> 00:30:06,560
than we had previously had with any of our marketing beats.

508
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,721
Even our beat around November 11th,

509
00:30:08,721 --> 00:30:10,543
that had...

510
00:30:11,093 --> 00:30:16,978
basically the same amount of visitors as our IGN event and that was featured on IGN's homepage and

511
00:30:16,978 --> 00:30:24,104
other and their YouTube. Whereas this marketing beating around November 11th was a lot minor,

512
00:30:24,104 --> 00:30:28,848
but had much more impact because of our key art. And even our average days where we had nothing

513
00:30:28,848 --> 00:30:33,351
going on was still double and higher than the

514
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:40,714
regular days from before. So you can definitely see that that big boost and then these numbers

515
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:47,299
actually then going into launch increase immensely. But I just wanted to take that time frame from

516
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:54,163
when we had the original key art and then when we updated the key art. And again, I truly believe

517
00:30:54,163 --> 00:30:58,326
that the revising our key art played a big role in getting these numbers higher.

518
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:01,474
So here are some of our results.

519
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:05,938
Overall, we doubled our Steam marketing numbers,

520
00:31:05,938 --> 00:31:08,780
150% for our daily wishlist,

521
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:13,125
120% for our Steam click-through rate.

522
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:14,726
Visitors went up 145%.

523
00:31:14,726 --> 00:31:17,689
Not that much of a daily impression increase, only 11.6.

524
00:31:17,689 --> 00:31:21,773
But again, because all the other numbers are higher,

525
00:31:21,773 --> 00:31:22,714
it shows me that the...

526
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:29,183
KeyArt really did convert people into wanting to check out the game and going to the page

527
00:31:29,183 --> 00:31:35,346
because if the impressions are about the same but everything else is going,

528
00:31:35,346 --> 00:31:39,368
the only thing that's changed is the KeyArt. That's what it is.

529
00:31:41,594 --> 00:31:46,077
And it isn't just your store key art where we saw a difference.

530
00:31:46,077 --> 00:31:49,959
So here, we use the key art for the thumbnail

531
00:31:49,959 --> 00:31:51,300
on the left for a trailer.

532
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,982
And on the left, we use a generic thumbnail.

533
00:31:54,982 --> 00:31:57,304
At launch time, we were fortunate enough

534
00:31:57,304 --> 00:31:58,164
to have Nintendo.

535
00:31:58,865 --> 00:32:06,578
put up two trailers for the game on their YouTube channel and you can see here that the trailer on

536
00:32:06,578 --> 00:32:12,888
the right that uses our key art it had almost half a million views and it has

537
00:32:13,653 --> 00:32:20,258
three times as many views as a trailer with the generic thumbnail on the left, and it also has

538
00:32:20,258 --> 00:32:26,263
about three times as many likes. So you can really tell that it's not just in the store.

539
00:32:26,263 --> 00:32:31,767
When you're using it for your thumbnail or even social media, you can also increase your numbers

540
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:34,829
quite a bit. And that's the important thing is getting those marketing numbers.

541
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:38,790
up so you can then convert people into wishlists and sales.

542
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,330
Because ultimately, you know, you're not going to have 100% conversion.

543
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:48,772
Your conversion rates are going to be probably pretty low into actually getting into sales.

544
00:32:48,772 --> 00:32:54,013
But anything you can do to get those initial numbers up, then you have more people

545
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:54,873
to then convert into sales.

546
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:57,433
So here's another case study, and this time it's

547
00:32:57,433 --> 00:33:02,874
for Adventures of Chris. It's a game that we launched last year

548
00:33:02,874 --> 00:33:03,795
and...

549
00:33:04,797 --> 00:33:08,859
It really played a difference when we updated our key art here.

550
00:33:08,859 --> 00:33:11,080
I'm personally a big fan of it and I think

551
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:15,362
what the result is is night and day compared to the original key art.

552
00:33:15,362 --> 00:33:23,746
So here's the before and after.

553
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:28,867
On the top, you see top left is the original main key art.

554
00:33:28,867 --> 00:33:33,029
And then on top right is the original small capsule.

555
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:36,710
We'll start with the original key art on the left here.

556
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,791
So it had a kind of cartoonish 90s vibe.

557
00:33:39,791 --> 00:33:41,412
They didn't have an artist who could do something

558
00:33:41,412 --> 00:33:42,853
really high quality.

559
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:46,214
And so they went and fed into what the game's aesthetic was.

560
00:33:47,014 --> 00:33:49,234
But here it has a great, it has action.

561
00:33:49,234 --> 00:33:52,535
So you're seeing bit, you're seeing some characters,

562
00:33:52,535 --> 00:33:54,455
but your eye doesn't really have a focal point.

563
00:33:54,455 --> 00:33:56,396
So you see the logo on the left,

564
00:33:56,396 --> 00:33:58,296
kind of that's where my eye goes first.

565
00:33:58,296 --> 00:33:59,896
And I kind of miss everything else.

566
00:33:59,896 --> 00:34:02,437
The main character there in the middle,

567
00:34:02,437 --> 00:34:06,918
he's punching an enemy, but they kind of blend in together.

568
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:08,958
And actually the enemy is a bit bigger

569
00:34:08,958 --> 00:34:11,118
and that's not what you really want.

570
00:34:11,118 --> 00:34:15,379
It just needs to be more modernized.

571
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,822
and then with the small capsule on the right, again, it's just text on a map.

572
00:34:20,822 --> 00:34:25,685
Doesn't tell you anything about the game. At smaller size, it's pretty unreadable.

573
00:34:25,685 --> 00:34:31,308
And so when we went about modernizing it with the key art we produced down below,

574
00:34:31,308 --> 00:34:35,730
we really laid into the action elements of the game, bringing in different enemies.

575
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:40,653
So the left, you see there's, there are four enemies. You have some humor still in there

576
00:34:40,653 --> 00:34:45,116
with the balloons. You have some cookies there. And the middle focal point is.

577
00:34:46,045 --> 00:34:47,827
the main character and the logo.

578
00:34:47,827 --> 00:34:50,929
So you see that right away, especially the main character

579
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:51,509
is a focus here.

580
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:53,991
All the enemies are looking at him.

581
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:57,313
Everything feels with multiple dimensions.

582
00:34:57,313 --> 00:35:00,155
So you feel like the character on the bottom right,

583
00:35:00,155 --> 00:35:01,616
they're a bit forward.

584
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:03,778
Everyone else is different depths.

585
00:35:03,778 --> 00:35:05,339
And it plays really well.

586
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:08,421
And then we took that middle image of him

587
00:35:08,421 --> 00:35:13,505
and then put that with the logo to create the small capsule

588
00:35:13,505 --> 00:35:14,926
on the bottom right.

589
00:35:15,106 --> 00:35:19,168
at a small size, it's really legible and readable.

590
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:22,850
Again, a couple of graphical elements and a logo,

591
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:24,390
really clean, really nice.

592
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,771
And that's what I like about what we did here.

593
00:35:25,771 --> 00:35:28,873
So this time, instead of comparing the standard week,

594
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:31,834
I'm going to compare the three months prior to the change

595
00:35:31,834 --> 00:35:34,535
to the three months after the change.

596
00:35:34,535 --> 00:35:38,197
So here, you can see that our wish list per day

597
00:35:38,197 --> 00:35:40,998
on the chart on the left, this is prior to the current change.

598
00:35:42,776 --> 00:35:49,166
uh, was really low, two a day. That's not anything to, um, write about and, and say,

599
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:53,873
hey, look at this awesome work we're doing. Instead, um,

600
00:35:55,425 --> 00:35:59,567
Afterwards, you can see our numbers increased dramatically.

601
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:02,068
Now, our click-through rate was lower,

602
00:36:02,068 --> 00:36:05,810
but I think that's because we had way more impressions

603
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,452
because back here it was showing up in more areas.

604
00:36:08,452 --> 00:36:11,834
Thanks to its revision, people were seeing it a bit more.

605
00:36:11,834 --> 00:36:12,034
We

606
00:36:13,703 --> 00:36:20,207
maybe just in the upcoming title section and our visitor numbers doubled there you can see

607
00:36:20,207 --> 00:36:26,930
and then our wish list per day increased tenfold compared to before and ultimately you know that's

608
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:31,953
what you want you want those higher numbers and you want those visitor numbers to increase too

609
00:36:31,953 --> 00:36:38,036
you know here almost three times the visitor number a daily visitor number than before

610
00:36:38,036 --> 00:36:40,597
and i truly believe the cure played a big factor in that

611
00:36:42,378 --> 00:36:46,240
And then our results, so 900% increase in daily wishlists,

612
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,402
141% in daily visitors, and 220% increase in impressions.

613
00:36:49,402 --> 00:36:51,144
So our impressions increased a ton,

614
00:36:51,144 --> 00:36:55,086
even though, and so I think that's what kind of decreased

615
00:36:55,086 --> 00:36:56,147
our click-through rate.

616
00:36:56,147 --> 00:37:00,329
But not just that, we were also converting more people

617
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:04,592
going to the page through our trailers,

618
00:37:04,592 --> 00:37:08,254
our organic efforts on Reddit, on social media, Discord,

619
00:37:08,254 --> 00:37:10,236
because we had this better key art

620
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:11,617
that would attract people's eyes.

621
00:37:11,957 --> 00:37:15,278
Because before, people just were not interested in that 90s aesthetic.

622
00:37:15,278 --> 00:37:18,279
We did some market research and it just wasn't fitting.

623
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:21,740
So when we modernized it, we were getting more and more visitors to the page, which

624
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,000
was awesome.

625
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,201
And that's where I think we see those higher impression numbers.

626
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:31,983
And because when someone goes directly to your page from Twitter, it doesn't get counted

627
00:37:31,983 --> 00:37:33,263
as a click through.

628
00:37:33,263 --> 00:37:37,385
We were seeing way many impressions and I think that's why that's a little bit skewed.

629
00:37:40,052 --> 00:37:44,655
So I want to thank everyone for joining me during this talk today.

630
00:37:44,655 --> 00:37:50,999
I hope you learned a lot about great key art and I hope that seeing our numbers where we increased

631
00:37:50,999 --> 00:37:55,822
or doubled our numbers, tripled our numbers, even tenfold as with the last case study,

632
00:37:55,822 --> 00:38:00,285
that you got a lot out of this case. And if you want to reach out to me,

633
00:38:00,285 --> 00:38:02,686
you can hit me up at contact.graffitigames.com.

634
00:38:03,267 --> 00:38:08,169
I'm also going to be doing a live Q&A session after this, so feel free to join that and

635
00:38:08,169 --> 00:38:14,771
I can answer key art questions, try and help with finding an artist, anything, you know,

636
00:38:14,771 --> 00:38:18,033
talk about the numbers we saw, and just other tips and tricks that you can do.

637
00:38:18,033 --> 00:38:23,055
Again, thank you for joining me, and I hope you have a great rest of your GDC.
