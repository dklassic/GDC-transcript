Hello there, I'm Matt from Shut Up and Sit Down, coming to you from the DICE dimension where we reside eternally.

2
00:00:06,232 --> 00:00:08,633
We're going to be at GDC this year running things.

3
00:00:09,054 --> 00:00:13,556
Yeah, and by running things I mean sitting at wooden picnic tables and playing board games.

4
00:00:13,896 --> 00:00:19,660
Check out classics from 2016 like Captain Sonar, Innis, Junk Art, and more.

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,181
About seven more things. Exactly.

6
00:00:22,421 --> 00:00:27,984
This is our third year running the booth at GDC where you can come along, decompress, and look at some interesting designs.

7
00:00:28,465 --> 00:00:34,231
So when you're inevitably exhausted by people with weird headsets telling you that they are the future and you need to give them the money,

8
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,195
come and spend time with us, because it's better.

9
00:00:37,855 --> 00:00:38,236
Bye!
