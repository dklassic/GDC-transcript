1
00:00:05,489 --> 00:00:07,694
And also, I was reminded to remind everybody

2
00:00:07,734 --> 00:00:10,481
to please fill out the evaluation forms at the end,

3
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:12,546
because that's what makes these talks possible.

4
00:00:13,087 --> 00:00:14,029
So, thank you for that.

5
00:00:15,546 --> 00:00:15,867
All right.

6
00:00:16,287 --> 00:00:18,469
So we're going to get this started.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,134
Thank you for coming here on a 10 AM on Tuesday.

8
00:00:24,194 --> 00:00:29,058
We realize that getting game developers to do anything at

9
00:00:29,298 --> 00:00:31,320
10 AM is difficult, much less to come to a talk.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,481
So thank you for being here.

11
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:34,943
And we promise to make it worth your while.

12
00:00:37,305 --> 00:00:38,225
I'm Rob Zubek.

13
00:00:38,345 --> 00:00:39,166
This is Matt Vianey.

14
00:00:39,986 --> 00:00:42,907
We are the founders of Somasim, an indie

15
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:43,968
studio in Chicago.

16
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:47,570
And this is our talk about running a post-apocalyptic

17
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,411
games indie studio, or should I say, running a

18
00:00:50,631 --> 00:00:52,372
post-apocalyptic indie studio.

19
00:00:52,972 --> 00:00:56,674
So what this means, we're going to unpack in just a little bit.

20
00:00:57,434 --> 00:00:59,295
But generally speaking, this is going

21
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:00,856
to be a talk about the stuff we learned

22
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,918
in the process of developing our latest game called Project

23
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:05,398
Hanoveris.

24
00:01:05,558 --> 00:01:07,419
It's released in September 2016, so last fall.

25
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,722
But when we started working on it several years ago, the

26
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:13,983
market was very different.

27
00:01:14,263 --> 00:01:17,326
So we started with different assumptions, and we ended in a

28
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:18,887
market that was quite different.

29
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:22,570
And this is going to be a talk about the kind of stuff we've

30
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,753
learned in the process of doing this and the process of

31
00:01:25,873 --> 00:01:27,034
doing the business side of it.

32
00:01:27,474 --> 00:01:29,816
And it's going to be a talk about actually the business

33
00:01:30,036 --> 00:01:33,239
and running a studio kind of things, and not so much about

34
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:35,701
design or programming, although those will show up a

35
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:36,341
little bit in there.

36
00:01:37,102 --> 00:01:41,124
So what do I mean by the situation has changed?

37
00:01:42,905 --> 00:01:50,008
So what happened was, as we know with the market changing

38
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:53,470
and so on, we're going to illustrate with just a few

39
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,771
numbers pulled off from the PC market.

40
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,772
We're going to talk about the PC market, because that's

41
00:01:57,832 --> 00:02:00,614
traditionally been the most friendly one for indies such

42
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:01,114
as ourselves.

43
00:02:01,834 --> 00:02:05,516
And specifically, I'm going to use numbers from Steam and

44
00:02:05,556 --> 00:02:08,937
from Steam Spy because they are publicly available and

45
00:02:08,977 --> 00:02:10,458
they are very easy to get.

46
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:14,139
But the lessons are not going to be limited

47
00:02:14,339 --> 00:02:15,300
necessarily to Steam.

48
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,721
Similar things you can see in other storefronts and so on.

49
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,463
So without further ado, let's talk about how the situation

50
00:02:22,503 --> 00:02:25,424
has changed over the last few years before we get to the

51
00:02:25,464 --> 00:02:25,964
meat of the talk.

52
00:02:26,745 --> 00:02:29,886
The first thing I want to look at is the number of games being

53
00:02:29,926 --> 00:02:30,286
published.

54
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:33,467
And we've all seen the articles show up online about

55
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:38,730
how this year we've seen the number of games released this

56
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,451
year on Steam are the 30% of the total number of games and

57
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:42,291
so on.

58
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,032
But let's put it in perspective, right?

59
00:02:44,112 --> 00:02:46,413
As a timeline, what happened over the years?

60
00:02:47,153 --> 00:02:51,415
If we look back 2010, 11, and so on, very few games released

61
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:52,995
every year, maybe a few hundred.

62
00:02:55,197 --> 00:02:57,300
I apologize.

63
00:02:58,622 --> 00:02:59,863
And then 2013, something happens.

64
00:03:00,063 --> 00:03:01,245
There's an inflection point.

65
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:05,130
At around that time, Steam introduces Greenlight, and

66
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,471
things change a little bit.

67
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:09,736
Now we see thousands of games released every year.

68
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:12,339
This past year, the estimate is about 4,700.

69
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:16,290
which is not unreasonable.

70
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,890
If we look at the shape of the curve,

71
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,071
it increases linearly,

72
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:21,091
and I was sort of extending it further,

73
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:23,212
trying to estimate where things will be.

74
00:03:23,292 --> 00:03:24,853
If we keep the same velocity,

75
00:03:25,393 --> 00:03:28,454
then we're looking at 6,000 games a year this year,

76
00:03:28,954 --> 00:03:30,435
before end of this year.

77
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:32,055
So that's a lot of games, right?

78
00:03:32,895 --> 00:03:35,136
And when we talk about the changing situation,

79
00:03:35,396 --> 00:03:36,997
this is our competition, right?

80
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:39,658
These are the kinds of market situation

81
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:40,458
that we have to look at.

82
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:41,198
So.

83
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:44,495
Will this velocity keep increasing?

84
00:03:45,176 --> 00:03:45,576
Who knows.

85
00:03:46,197 --> 00:03:50,280
But what we've seen in other media, whether it's music or

86
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,424
e-books or whatever, is that once we have an electronic

87
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:59,088
distribution system that doesn't have limitations on

88
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:01,510
it, the amount of content increases.

89
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,592
The amount of music increases.

90
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:04,793
The amount of e-books increases.

91
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:07,515
There's no reason to think that we're going to see this

92
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:08,796
curve slow down.

93
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:12,277
So that's one kind of set of numbers.

94
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:14,858
I want to take a look at another set of numbers is what

95
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:17,539
happens with this once we start adding it over time,

96
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,460
which is the total number of games on Steam.

97
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,221
And the total number of games, since we have this nice linear

98
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:25,523
velocity, so adding it up, we get a nice

99
00:04:26,003 --> 00:04:26,923
quadratic kind of a thing.

100
00:04:27,203 --> 00:04:28,644
So it just keeps going up.

101
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:31,865
And again, there's no reason to think this will slow down.

102
00:04:33,226 --> 00:04:36,349
And the reason to think about the total number of games is

103
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:39,232
because that's a different kind of competition, too.

104
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:42,054
On the previous slide, we saw the number of games being

105
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:43,075
released concurrently.

106
00:04:43,596 --> 00:04:45,277
And that's important because we compete

107
00:04:45,297 --> 00:04:46,138
with them for attention.

108
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:49,981
But the back catalog is what we compete against for sales.

109
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:50,942
So for example.

110
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,804
We released Project Hyruza in September of 2016.

111
00:04:56,185 --> 00:04:59,106
When we released it, that week, I think there were 80

112
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:02,707
other games released just that week, plus DLCs and stuff.

113
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:05,488
So when we got onto the new releases list, we dropped off

114
00:05:05,528 --> 00:05:06,309
immediately, right?

115
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,990
We got no traffic from that.

116
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,112
But the second consideration is the back catalog.

117
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,821
If the player is going to log into Steam or GOG or whatever,

118
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:21,362
and they're going to see our game, are they going to buy it?

119
00:05:21,842 --> 00:05:23,863
Or are they going to look at their wish list and say, you

120
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:26,304
know what, that game is new, and it's out for $20.

121
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:30,646
But there's this game on my wish list that's 70% off that

122
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:33,928
I've been dying to buy it for two years now.

123
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,289
I'm going to buy that instead and wait for this one to go.

124
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:37,313
Right?

125
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:39,955
Who here hasn't done that?

126
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:42,576
This is a totally normal thing for players to do.

127
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:43,817
And I apologize.

128
00:05:44,198 --> 00:05:47,019
My lap seems to be going out a little bit.

129
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,881
I'm going to move it right here.

130
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:53,824
So we're looking at the back catalog as

131
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:54,745
competition for sales.

132
00:05:55,185 --> 00:05:59,788
And the one more thing that I want to look at is the demand

133
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:01,929
side, because we looked at the supply side, how many games

134
00:06:01,989 --> 00:06:02,590
are there out there.

135
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,872
The supply side, what does that look like?

136
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,693
And we don't have good numbers from Steam about the total

137
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:09,313
number of accounts.

138
00:06:09,614 --> 00:06:12,675
But what they do publish is the number of concurrent

139
00:06:12,695 --> 00:06:16,597
players, for example, every Christmas or every New Year's.

140
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:20,379
And the exact number doesn't matter so much as the shape of

141
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:21,179
the curve, right?

142
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,401
The total number of concurrent players every

143
00:06:23,441 --> 00:06:24,881
year grows linearly.

144
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:27,543
And if we use that as a standard for the total number

145
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,744
of players, then we can see that the

146
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:33,786
Demand side grows linearly, and then the supply side grows

147
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:38,088
like this, and this gap right there is the new situation

148
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:38,548
that we're in.

149
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:43,230
So given these kinds of numbers that we looked at,

150
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:45,631
what does that mean for us?

151
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:47,092
Well.

152
00:06:48,278 --> 00:06:52,560
There's been a lot of talk about is the apocalypse happening, is

153
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,362
it really a thing, it's not happening. It doesn't matter.

154
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:58,624
We're not going to necessarily talk about this kind of thing.

155
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:02,606
It doesn't matter. The situation has changed. Numbers speak for

156
00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:07,369
themselves. So today what we're going to talk about is given

157
00:07:07,409 --> 00:07:10,991
that the situation has changed, what can we do, sort of

158
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:15,553
ourselves, you guys, all of us together, to adjust, to adapt

159
00:07:15,973 --> 00:07:16,414
ourselves?

160
00:07:17,323 --> 00:07:24,048
to this new situation. So just a little bit of background about us before we get too much

161
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:31,853
further into it. So we are, as I mentioned, Somasim. We started our studio in 2013. We

162
00:07:31,913 --> 00:07:36,677
are based out of Chicago. And first of all, 2013 was a very good year for us. We started

163
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:42,910
Probably not the right time to start a studio, as you might

164
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:43,310
imagine.

165
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,152
We should have probably done this a few years earlier, but

166
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,394
hindsight is 20-20, as they say.

167
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:52,238
But nevertheless, we made our first game.

168
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:54,860
It was a small city builder called 1849.

169
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,822
We shipped that in one year, in 2014.

170
00:07:59,143 --> 00:08:01,666
We were also working on a second game, which we shipped

171
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:03,427
last year, called Project High-Rise.

172
00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:04,428
We released that.

173
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:10,851
And, you know, knocking on wood, this will allow us to make a third game and so on.

174
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:15,954
And the point of this thing is that the numbers are showing that the market is changing and

175
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:16,814
it's a tough market.

176
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:19,275
It's tough for different reasons than it used to be.

177
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:21,276
But we're still working on this.

178
00:08:21,316 --> 00:08:26,098
We're still trying to make this into a business and a business.

179
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:28,721
an opportunity for us to make games

180
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:30,704
and make a living off of it.

181
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:31,965
And so are you, right?

182
00:08:31,985 --> 00:08:34,748
I mean, we are all in this sort of together.

183
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,953
We all have the same goal of making this viable for us.

184
00:08:38,993 --> 00:08:41,716
So let's figure out how can we together

185
00:08:42,477 --> 00:08:43,618
deal with this situation.

186
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:44,279
So.

187
00:08:46,605 --> 00:08:49,006
The meat of the talk is going to be three sections.

188
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:52,928
I'm going to start by talking about discoverability, how

189
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:54,969
things have changed, and how we can adjust

190
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:55,669
ourselves to that.

191
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:58,850
Then I'm going to hand this clicker over to Matt, who's

192
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:01,811
going to talk about self-publishing and how that

193
00:09:01,871 --> 00:09:02,311
is changing.

194
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:05,913
And then he's going to talk about the effects on studio

195
00:09:05,993 --> 00:09:06,913
and team organization.

196
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:10,475
So without further ado, I'm going to jump right into it.

197
00:09:11,475 --> 00:09:11,555
So.

198
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,961
Discoverability is sort of a perennial problem for all of

199
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,882
us, and it has for a long time.

200
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:21,663
And when I talk about discoverability, it's the

201
00:09:21,703 --> 00:09:23,203
problem of getting eyeballs on the game.

202
00:09:23,624 --> 00:09:26,945
So how do we get players to find out about our game and to

203
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,626
know that this is actually something that exists that

204
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:30,746
they want to play?

205
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:34,067
Because we all know that we're making games for players.

206
00:09:34,147 --> 00:09:36,248
There are players out there who will want our games.

207
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:37,168
We just need to find them.

208
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,569
No matter how small a game, there are

209
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:40,449
people who will want it.

210
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,511
But how do they find out about it?

211
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:45,834
And that's been the standard problem all along.

212
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:47,816
And there are sort of two parts of it.

213
00:09:47,936 --> 00:09:51,160
One is discovering from the outside, bringing people into

214
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,303
your web page, storefront, whatever, and then

215
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,744
discoverability from the inside.

216
00:09:55,964 --> 00:09:59,608
Like once they're in a store, again, whether it's iTunes or

217
00:09:59,868 --> 00:10:03,552
Steam or Google Play or Gog or whatever, how do they find out

218
00:10:03,592 --> 00:10:05,033
about this game once they're there?

219
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:09,191
And discoverability is always hard for indies because all

220
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:13,558
media follow a very power law distribution where the big

221
00:10:13,618 --> 00:10:20,009
guys get all the attention and they get the players, they get

222
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:20,650
the money, and so on.

223
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:26,318
And the smaller studios or smaller teams end up in the

224
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:27,339
so-called long tail.

225
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,644
The idea of the long tail, as you know, is that given an

226
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:33,348
electronic distribution media where it's cheap to distribute

227
00:10:33,388 --> 00:10:37,093
things, hopefully the small players will be able to

228
00:10:38,434 --> 00:10:41,275
sell a smaller number of games to people who are interested.

229
00:10:41,695 --> 00:10:44,396
So for indies, if we're looking at this long table,

230
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:46,056
we're somewhere on the floor over there, right?

231
00:10:47,176 --> 00:10:51,037
And the challenge for us is to find those players who will

232
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:53,538
learn about us, because we don't have the marketing

233
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:57,039
budgets of the big guys.

234
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:59,680
So we're going to talk about pulling people from the outside

235
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,200
in a little bit.

236
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,001
Now, let's first talk about getting people to discover the

237
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:05,841
game once they're on the store page.

238
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:11,160
And traditionally, this means getting featured in some way,

239
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,081
whether it's getting featured through a featuring slot

240
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,682
that's hand-created, or maybe something like a top 10 list,

241
00:11:18,882 --> 00:11:20,723
or new releases list, and so on.

242
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:24,944
And if you go and log into Steam or another store, you

243
00:11:24,964 --> 00:11:27,945
will see this kind of a long list of different things that

244
00:11:27,965 --> 00:11:29,325
the store is telling you about.

245
00:11:30,466 --> 00:11:34,630
and a lot of the thinking is about how do we get ourselves featured on this?

246
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:40,335
And what I'm going to say is maybe that's not the focus anymore

247
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:47,382
because the amount of featuring that's actually likely to happen to us is relatively small.

248
00:11:47,863 --> 00:11:51,404
If we look at what happens when the player logs into Steam,

249
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,906
opens up their Steam client, and they're going to go play a

250
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:57,507
game, but before they do that, they want to look at their

251
00:11:57,547 --> 00:11:58,667
store and see what's there.

252
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,108
They're going to see the stuff above the fold first.

253
00:12:01,428 --> 00:12:03,289
And that's the sort of newspaper metaphor.

254
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:05,410
Like if you have a newspaper, you see it in a store.

255
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,751
The stuff above the fold is the stuff right below the

256
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,372
masthead, and then the other stuff you don't see

257
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:11,512
necessarily immediately.

258
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:15,577
So above the fold, we have some featuring slots, which

259
00:12:15,637 --> 00:12:16,178
is very good.

260
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:20,183
In fact, right now there are 12 of them in a carousel that

261
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:21,164
flips back and forth.

262
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:24,609
And that's the stuff that the player will see first.

263
00:12:25,049 --> 00:12:28,294
These are the featured and recommended games, or maybe

264
00:12:28,334 --> 00:12:29,715
manually curated and so on.

265
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:33,279
Then if the player scrolls further down, they're going to

266
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:35,160
see additional featuring slots.

267
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:37,743
So they might see a special offers section, for example.

268
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:39,144
And these things change, right?

269
00:12:39,244 --> 00:12:40,625
Some things go up, some things go down.

270
00:12:41,126 --> 00:12:43,448
And in a section like this, maybe there will be six games,

271
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:45,150
maybe there will be 12 games, and so on.

272
00:12:46,777 --> 00:12:50,841
then the question is if the player was to be scrolling

273
00:12:50,881 --> 00:12:53,023
further down and so on, they would probably see more

274
00:12:53,043 --> 00:12:54,205
featuring slots, right?

275
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:59,891
But what I would actually say is that they won't.

276
00:13:00,652 --> 00:13:04,376
Those other ones don't really matter so much because if a

277
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,479
player is going to the store page to play a game,

278
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,260
They're just gonna play a game.

279
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,561
They might see something above the fold,

280
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,022
but they're not gonna go exploring.

281
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,243
They will go exploring only if there's a sale

282
00:13:14,403 --> 00:13:15,404
or something special going on.

283
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,625
So what we're really talking about is

284
00:13:18,246 --> 00:13:20,367
the featuring slots that matter in any store

285
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,107
are the top ones.

286
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,149
And there's a limited number of them.

287
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:25,710
Very small, finite number of them.

288
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:30,111
So what this means is that for featuring, for bringing

289
00:13:30,171 --> 00:13:33,372
players in from inside the store into our page, we're

290
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,274
running into two sort of competing forces, or two

291
00:13:36,314 --> 00:13:38,315
forces that are both working against us.

292
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:42,236
One, the larger the stores grow, the more players they

293
00:13:42,276 --> 00:13:44,838
get, which means that each of those featuring slots becomes

294
00:13:44,978 --> 00:13:47,939
more valuable because there are more eyeballs looking at

295
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:51,301
it, therefore those featuring slots are going to go to the

296
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:53,181
best sellers, obviously because.

297
00:13:54,976 --> 00:13:56,717
That's how we make money, right?

298
00:13:57,438 --> 00:14:00,799
And then the second force is that the more games there are

299
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,482
on stores, the less likely, statistically, each game is to

300
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:06,682
get one of those featuring slots.

301
00:14:07,403 --> 00:14:10,725
So these are two kind of forces that work against small

302
00:14:10,745 --> 00:14:15,267
developers such as ourselves from getting visibility inside

303
00:14:15,307 --> 00:14:15,607
a store.

304
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:20,548
So what happens in a situation like this is storefronts

305
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,230
develop different strategies.

306
00:14:22,911 --> 00:14:26,195
And we've seen this with any other storefronts that have a

307
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:28,839
huge inventory of product, digital products such as

308
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,421
Amazon, Netflix, and so on.

309
00:14:30,982 --> 00:14:31,923
They all end up.

310
00:14:32,984 --> 00:14:34,746
going towards algorithmic recommendations.

311
00:14:34,866 --> 00:14:37,048
And indeed, Steam has been doing the same.

312
00:14:37,468 --> 00:14:40,531
So algorithmic recommendations do the sort of thing of

313
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:42,512
they look at what you've played before,

314
00:14:43,253 --> 00:14:46,295
and then they give you a recommendation based on that.

315
00:14:46,656 --> 00:14:50,139
And this is very good, as instead of human curation,

316
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:50,719
now we have

317
00:14:52,361 --> 00:14:55,845
system that tells you, hey, if you like this, you might like that. And here's an example.

318
00:14:55,945 --> 00:15:03,293
I was logging into my steam client the other day and it tells me right up front, hey, there's

319
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:08,138
this new game called stellar monarch. You play strategy games and simulation games and

320
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:10,681
forex games and indie games. Why don't you try this one?

321
00:15:11,422 --> 00:15:13,824
So I thought to myself, why don't I try this one?

322
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:14,705
It sounds good.

323
00:15:15,105 --> 00:15:18,047
So even without doing any research, just based on this,

324
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:19,929
I went and purchased it and loved it.

325
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:20,810
It was great.

326
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,553
I mean, and I was so happy that the automated system

327
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:27,375
gave me this recommendation right up top above the fold

328
00:15:27,435 --> 00:15:29,137
because otherwise I would never have discovered it.

329
00:15:30,973 --> 00:15:42,299
And it's an indie game. I think it's like a one or two person team. And what are the chances that they would have been selected by a human curation process?

330
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:49,102
Probably fairly low. But the automation system recommended it to me and I was very happy with the result.

331
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:50,863
And we see Steam sort of

332
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,166
going further with that, right?

333
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:56,008
They're sort of continuing with that,

334
00:15:56,228 --> 00:15:56,969
and in fact right now,

335
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:01,715
looking at the featuring slots above the fold,

336
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:05,480
about half of them right now are algorithmically selected.

337
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:07,542
So, what does this mean?

338
00:16:08,604 --> 00:16:11,105
This has an effect on us.

339
00:16:12,046 --> 00:16:15,227
As we make games, we have to think about, all right, if

340
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:18,790
we're going to be looking for discoverability within a

341
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:21,911
store, how do we make life easier for ourselves to be

342
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:25,013
discovered through these algorithms?

343
00:16:25,794 --> 00:16:27,795
How do we make ourselves algorithm friendly?

344
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,556
And here's the thing.

345
00:16:30,637 --> 00:16:32,598
Recommendation algorithms, whether they're

346
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:39,288
or Netflix or whatever, they based on some kind of similarity

347
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:43,529
metrics. There's always a tension inside them. So Amazon

348
00:16:43,549 --> 00:16:46,610
might work on purchase history, Netflix might work on stars,

349
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,410
Steam might work on tags and purchase history, et cetera. In

350
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:54,171
any case, there's always this tension between on one hand

351
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,972
looking at your history and giving you more of the same,

352
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,652
more of what you've already played, and also on the other

353
00:16:59,692 --> 00:16:59,852
hand,

354
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:02,555
doing exploration, right?

355
00:17:02,895 --> 00:17:03,756
Given what you've played,

356
00:17:04,017 --> 00:17:05,919
maybe you wanna try something very different

357
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,883
that you wouldn't think of trying out yourself.

358
00:17:09,464 --> 00:17:11,486
And this is a tension that historically

359
00:17:11,586 --> 00:17:14,290
tends to swing towards giving you more of the same.

360
00:17:15,731 --> 00:17:18,193
just because it's easier to know given your history,

361
00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:21,136
given my history of strategy simulation 4X Indy,

362
00:17:21,396 --> 00:17:22,717
that I'm gonna like these kinds of games.

363
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:24,999
And sure enough, I keep getting them over and over.

364
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,043
But who knows, maybe there's a racing, farming,

365
00:17:29,283 --> 00:17:32,686
Indy 2D game out there that I would really love.

366
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:33,827
And chances are I would, right?

367
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:36,350
Because I like my racing games every now and then.

368
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,471
I like my farming games every now and then.

369
00:17:38,572 --> 00:17:40,453
But it's hard for the algorithms to know

370
00:17:40,513 --> 00:17:41,614
that this is the combo for me.

371
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,576
So here's my postulate.

372
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:47,198
I think that what we're going to see with the

373
00:17:47,258 --> 00:17:50,279
recommendation systems is that it's going to be easier for

374
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:54,222
niche games and genre games to get recommended to players.

375
00:17:54,822 --> 00:17:58,904
And it's going to be harder for esoteric games or games

376
00:17:58,964 --> 00:18:03,587
that span multiple genres and multiple niches to get

377
00:18:03,627 --> 00:18:04,047
recommended.

378
00:18:05,514 --> 00:18:09,284
We'll see how this plays out for sure. But if this is the case,

379
00:18:09,905 --> 00:18:12,732
then niches are starting to become more powerful.

380
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:17,752
In fact, we have ourselves defined ourselves as a genre

381
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:21,095
studio not because of this back in 2013.

382
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:23,496
Our thinking was we like simulation games.

383
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:24,317
We like strategy games.

384
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:27,019
We're going to concentrate on those because we like them and

385
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:28,060
we think we're good at them.

386
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,982
And it's even in the name, SomaSim.

387
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:35,025
But it's been an interesting kind of experience to follow

388
00:18:35,065 --> 00:18:36,546
through with this and see how this grows.

389
00:18:37,147 --> 00:18:40,729
So if this is something that you are considering, a couple

390
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,391
words about targeting a niche.

391
00:18:44,032 --> 00:18:49,174
One, niches are sort of recapitulating the same difficulties of the larger market where

392
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:54,796
you're still competing against a number of games that are kind of similar to each other

393
00:18:54,816 --> 00:18:59,038
and you're still competing for eyeballs just on a smaller scale.

394
00:18:59,878 --> 00:19:02,059
And niches do get very faddish.

395
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:05,560
They get based on style.

396
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:10,081
If you're right now releasing a Proc Gen game, you're great.

397
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,982
But if you're just starting working on a Proc Gen open

398
00:19:14,002 --> 00:19:16,082
world sandbox or something like that, where will the

399
00:19:16,102 --> 00:19:17,482
market be when you finish this?

400
00:19:17,842 --> 00:19:20,903
So this is something that we've thought of through the

401
00:19:20,923 --> 00:19:22,503
process of development of our last game.

402
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:25,026
And it's something that stays on our mind.

403
00:19:25,406 --> 00:19:27,989
You always have to be several years ahead of the market.

404
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,493
And in niches specifically, how are the fads going to go?

405
00:19:33,521 --> 00:19:37,264
So always have to look at the future and also the other thing

406
00:19:37,284 --> 00:19:39,946
that was kind of surprising to us but in retrospect shouldn't

407
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:43,489
have been is that niches are communities. They have their own

408
00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:47,752
sets of expectations. They have their own ideas about anything

409
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:53,957
from UI conventions to mechanics to systems and so on. So you

410
00:19:53,977 --> 00:19:56,840
have to be aware of them because otherwise you're going to get

411
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,523
very vocal feedback about that. So it helps to be a player

412
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:01,383
inside that niche.

413
00:20:01,764 --> 00:20:04,666
All right, so we talked a lot about recommendation systems

414
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:09,049
and how to look at discoverability inside the

415
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:11,891
store, and I'm going to wrap up quickly looking at

416
00:20:11,951 --> 00:20:13,393
discoverability from the outside.

417
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:17,456
So the problem of bringing eyeballs from the sort of

418
00:20:17,556 --> 00:20:19,117
outside world looking at your game.

419
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,299
And that's a problem that never went away.

420
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,520
It's always been a problem.

421
00:20:24,561 --> 00:20:26,242
Word of mouth is obviously the best.

422
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:29,205
way to get recommendations.

423
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:32,709
The thing that we've seen becoming very, very, very

424
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:35,052
important has been YouTube and Twitch.

425
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:39,756
And specifically, things like, again, if we're looking at

426
00:20:39,816 --> 00:20:44,662
genres and specific kind of styles of games.

427
00:20:45,422 --> 00:20:48,544
look at communities that orient around them. For example,

428
00:20:49,065 --> 00:20:53,408
Project High Rise again, before we released the game we sent

429
00:20:53,468 --> 00:20:57,151
out keys to YouTubers, Twitch players and so on and we were

430
00:20:57,211 --> 00:21:00,193
very lucky to be picked up to catch the interest of a few

431
00:21:00,253 --> 00:21:03,755
players who specifically play simulation strategy games.

432
00:21:04,155 --> 00:21:06,377
and they had audiences who specifically

433
00:21:06,457 --> 00:21:07,977
looked for simulation strategy games.

434
00:21:08,438 --> 00:21:10,359
So that was sort of a match made in heaven.

435
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:12,300
We were lucky enough to attract their attention

436
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,722
and from that, players who look for these kinds of games

437
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:19,103
learned about them, learned about our game.

438
00:21:19,604 --> 00:21:23,386
So we got some number of hundreds of thousands of views

439
00:21:23,446 --> 00:21:24,906
on these videos that they made

440
00:21:25,487 --> 00:21:27,768
and that's a huge number, right?

441
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:34,491
One, just the number itself is big, and two, the audience is looking for these kinds of

442
00:21:34,531 --> 00:21:34,691
games.

443
00:21:34,712 --> 00:21:37,473
This is a different audience than a mass market audience.

444
00:21:37,673 --> 00:21:40,335
So this was very, very interesting and very valuable.

445
00:21:40,635 --> 00:21:46,878
So in summary of this section, when we look at discoverability and getting our game out

446
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:53,721
getting eyeballs on our game and so on. I think the traditional ways of things like

447
00:21:53,881 --> 00:22:00,563
getting selected by curators is going to be less likely. Things like new releases lists

448
00:22:00,883 --> 00:22:05,365
are going to be much less valuable just because of the velocity. We've seen the numbers, new

449
00:22:05,405 --> 00:22:08,746
releases lists, showing up on those is no longer useful.

450
00:22:09,906 --> 00:22:12,387
But what is going to be increasingly important, I

451
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:15,227
think, is one, becoming algorithm friendly.

452
00:22:15,487 --> 00:22:19,948
So keeping this in our mind from the very beginning of the

453
00:22:19,968 --> 00:22:22,508
design process, how do we make our game easier to be

454
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:23,809
discovered for people?

455
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:28,350
And two, bringing in outside traffic from genre-specific

456
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,470
audiences, such as YouTubers, let's players, and so on, who

457
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,671
specialize in these kinds of games.

458
00:22:34,071 --> 00:22:36,431
So that's that for my discoverability section.

459
00:22:36,611 --> 00:22:38,391
Now I'm going to hand this over to Matt, who's going to

460
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:38,791
talk about.

461
00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:40,544
Parts two and three.

462
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:41,244
Thank you.

463
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:48,330
Excellent.

464
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:49,671
Wasn't Rob great?

465
00:22:49,711 --> 00:22:50,171
Thanks, Rob.

466
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:55,495
So Rob started to touch on how do you get traffic from

467
00:22:55,995 --> 00:22:57,977
outside of the stores into your site?

468
00:22:58,697 --> 00:23:00,659
How do you start building up the number of eyeballs that

469
00:23:00,699 --> 00:23:01,499
you get on your game?

470
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:04,061
And that's where I'd like to move next in my next section

471
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:06,082
as we go the right way in the slide deck.

472
00:23:06,977 --> 00:23:11,100
So I want to talk about publishing, about how the numbers that we've seen, the 6,000

473
00:23:11,521 --> 00:23:15,944
games that are going to come out this year, added on to the 12,000 games that are already

474
00:23:16,044 --> 00:23:20,527
on Steam, how that impacts publishing and getting eyeballs on.

475
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:28,181
Before we look at 2017, I want to go back in time to the halcyon days of 2011, when

476
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,722
there were a few hundred games that came out every year on Steam.

477
00:23:31,382 --> 00:23:33,863
And back in those days, who needs publishers?

478
00:23:34,003 --> 00:23:34,704
We're indies.

479
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:39,345
We're just going to put our game out there and we'll put it up on Steam, on IndieDB,

480
00:23:39,445 --> 00:23:40,206
on Desura.

481
00:23:41,246 --> 00:23:44,507
Then we'll flog it to death on social media, we'll get a lot of traffic, people will buy

482
00:23:44,547 --> 00:23:47,448
our game, it'll be awesome, we'll make another one, it's Indie Paradise, yay!

483
00:23:48,615 --> 00:23:49,856
Except that's not really true anymore.

484
00:23:50,756 --> 00:23:52,337
And I also would argue that in 2011,

485
00:23:52,417 --> 00:23:55,258
that wasn't really true either.

486
00:23:55,838 --> 00:23:58,579
Platforms like Valve, like iTunes, like Google,

487
00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:01,460
were picking games that they liked as curators,

488
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,461
they were putting them on prominent featuring slots,

489
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:05,401
they were doing a lot of promotion,

490
00:24:05,441 --> 00:24:06,682
they were driving a lot of traffic there.

491
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:10,143
Sounds like a publisher to me, but that's just me.

492
00:24:10,543 --> 00:24:10,703
So.

493
00:24:12,024 --> 00:24:15,366
To come back to 2017, we've changed things a lot.

494
00:24:15,526 --> 00:24:17,507
Valve is now acting like an online store.

495
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:19,648
There's a loose selection process

496
00:24:19,688 --> 00:24:21,489
that's getting looser and looser all the time.

497
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,891
And it's up to us as the developers,

498
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:26,532
as the people who make the games,

499
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:29,093
to drive traffic, to get the eyeballs in the game,

500
00:24:29,153 --> 00:24:31,675
to do the work that they were sort of doing for us in 2011.

501
00:24:32,055 --> 00:24:35,637
And I'd like to take a break for a moment

502
00:24:35,677 --> 00:24:37,198
and talk about the future of Steam.

503
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:39,419
Because Steam for us, at least for us as PC,

504
00:24:41,153 --> 00:24:43,174
developers is an important platform.

505
00:24:43,575 --> 00:24:45,216
So let's look at where Steam thinks

506
00:24:45,316 --> 00:24:46,336
they wanna go in the future.

507
00:24:46,677 --> 00:24:49,819
Back in 2013, around the time we saw that inflection point

508
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:51,940
where things began to change,

509
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:54,142
Gabe Newell said the following thing,

510
00:24:54,262 --> 00:24:55,362
and I wanna read this one verbatim.

511
00:24:55,863 --> 00:24:57,704
If we're thinking about this correctly,

512
00:24:58,084 --> 00:25:00,586
anybody should be able to publish anything through Steam,

513
00:25:01,086 --> 00:25:02,427
where Steam is just a whole bunch

514
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:03,888
of servers and network bandwidth.

515
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,111
Sync in, sync in, sync in, okay.

516
00:25:08,911 --> 00:25:09,031
So.

517
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:12,793
Then this sort of came true last month,

518
00:25:14,034 --> 00:25:15,054
or I guess it's still this month,

519
00:25:16,175 --> 00:25:17,816
when Steam announced Steam Direct.

520
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:21,559
So, they're now getting rid of the greenlight process

521
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:23,880
that we saw in 2013 around that inflection point,

522
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:27,362
and now we see our goal is to provide developers

523
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:30,104
and publishers with a more direct publishing path

524
00:25:30,164 --> 00:25:33,586
and ultimately connect gamers with even more great content.

525
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:38,511
So basically, Steam's vision of where their platform

526
00:25:38,531 --> 00:25:41,472
should be in the future is the exact opposite

527
00:25:41,492 --> 00:25:42,133
of where it was in 2011.

528
00:25:42,193 --> 00:25:44,974
They don't want to do the curation.

529
00:25:45,454 --> 00:25:47,055
They don't want to do the selection.

530
00:25:47,135 --> 00:25:48,836
They want to let the market do that.

531
00:25:48,996 --> 00:25:50,657
The games that sell well will be the games

532
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:51,498
that get the featuring.

533
00:25:52,058 --> 00:25:53,879
So it's up to us to start to think about

534
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:55,940
how we're going to get those sales,

535
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,661
how are we gonna get those eyeballs onto our games?

536
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,202
And that becomes our job now.

537
00:26:00,082 --> 00:26:02,484
So, can you still do this kind of self-publishing

538
00:26:02,524 --> 00:26:03,264
that was being done in 2011?

539
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:09,034
You can put the game up on stores, but you've got to remember there are going to be 6,000

540
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,918
other people who are going to release new games next year, and that doesn't include

541
00:26:12,998 --> 00:26:17,983
things like DLCs and content packs and sprite packs and everything else that junks up the

542
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:20,686
front page and the release pattern thing on Steam.

543
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:21,807
So there's that.

544
00:26:23,168 --> 00:26:24,550
Can you flog it on social media?

545
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,593
Sure, but you've been on social media lately, right?

546
00:26:29,396 --> 00:26:32,139
It's kind of a dumpster fire, so good luck with that.

547
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:34,120
So what are we talking about?

548
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,502
What's the solution here?

549
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:38,865
We still need to do this real PR,

550
00:26:38,885 --> 00:26:40,346
this real marketing that has to be done.

551
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:43,049
And again, since Valve is no longer.

552
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:47,733
limiting the number of games and they want to broaden them, that becomes even more important.

553
00:26:48,294 --> 00:26:53,017
It requires a great deal of skill. It requires connections. You need to have that person

554
00:26:53,097 --> 00:26:57,621
at Valve, at Apple, at GOG that picks up your email, that replies to you in order to help

555
00:26:57,681 --> 00:27:02,385
get that featuring going. So what I'm saying is this becomes a full-time job. This is something

556
00:27:02,425 --> 00:27:06,968
that is really increasingly important. But what if you're terrible at it like us?

557
00:27:09,531 --> 00:27:12,192
It's dangerous out there, so you should take some help with you.

558
00:27:12,412 --> 00:27:14,353
So we think you should hire the right person for the job.

559
00:27:14,974 --> 00:27:19,676
When we made 1849 in 2013, our first game, we decided we need

560
00:27:19,696 --> 00:27:20,337
to do audio.

561
00:27:20,677 --> 00:27:21,637
Let's go ahead and do audio.

562
00:27:21,657 --> 00:27:22,438
We can do that ourselves.

563
00:27:24,199 --> 00:27:26,000
I had never done audio before, I have no idea how to do it.

564
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,162
Rob had never done audio before either,

565
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:30,924
he had no idea how to do it, but we didn't let that stop us.

566
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:32,325
And we did it anyway.

567
00:27:32,846 --> 00:27:34,427
And sure enough, when the game went out there,

568
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:37,690
we got a lot of replies in forum posts with things like,

569
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,591
those cows are terrible.

570
00:27:40,172 --> 00:27:41,252
Make the cows stop.

571
00:27:41,553 --> 00:27:42,634
Why is there so much mooing?

572
00:27:43,234 --> 00:27:44,255
Why is the mixing like that?

573
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:47,017
So when it came time for us to do Project High Rise,

574
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:49,359
I think the third thing we did was find somebody

575
00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:50,540
to do the audio for our game.

576
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,963
because we're not good at it. It's not a skill set that we have native to our team.

577
00:27:56,464 --> 00:28:00,127
And we think that you should hire the right person for the right job, if that's audio,

578
00:28:00,247 --> 00:28:04,410
if that's art, or if that's marketing. And so am I talking about the return of the publisher?

579
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,414
Because, you know, we're indies. Like, publishing and hiring a publisher sort of gives us all

580
00:28:09,494 --> 00:28:10,214
the creeps a little bit.

581
00:28:12,786 --> 00:28:17,129
Those numbers that Rob went over, those huge influx of games onto the market, they haven't

582
00:28:17,169 --> 00:28:22,994
just changed us as developers, they've changed publishers too. So publishers have also changed,

583
00:28:23,074 --> 00:28:27,857
they've evolved. Back in the battle days of 2006, we had old school publishers who did

584
00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:31,640
things like this, and most of those things are fine, but I'm an indie dev and I really

585
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,443
hate those last two. Take the majority of the revs and own the IP. I made the game,

586
00:28:35,483 --> 00:28:37,024
I want the revs, I made the game, I want the IP.

587
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:40,467
We've seen a new wave of publishers come on the scene

588
00:28:40,507 --> 00:28:42,389
that are willing to do help for marketing,

589
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:43,750
that are willing to do help for PR,

590
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,452
that have Twitch and YouTube connections,

591
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:49,275
that just take a cut of the revenues and don't own the IP.

592
00:28:50,376 --> 00:28:51,017
Which sounds great.

593
00:28:51,057 --> 00:28:52,478
And we've seen a lot of indies begin to work

594
00:28:52,518 --> 00:28:54,079
with these kind of new school publishers.

595
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,191
But how do we evaluate them?

596
00:28:57,231 --> 00:28:58,752
Like, I know how to evaluate an artist,

597
00:28:59,373 --> 00:29:00,594
a 3D artist, a 2D artist.

598
00:29:00,674 --> 00:29:02,135
I know how to evaluate a sound person,

599
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:04,217
how to evaluate somebody to work with us

600
00:29:04,237 --> 00:29:05,017
to help code the game.

601
00:29:05,478 --> 00:29:06,979
How do you evaluate a publishing partner?

602
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:08,820
Like, how do you know if they're right for your game?

603
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:10,902
So, some things to consider.

604
00:29:12,186 --> 00:29:13,827
Does their target audience match yours?

605
00:29:14,147 --> 00:29:17,808
Did they put out eight, 10 strategy simulation games

606
00:29:17,848 --> 00:29:18,749
in the past couple of years?

607
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:23,811
If so, they have eight or 10 games worth of players

608
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:26,232
that are right in your niche, right in your genre

609
00:29:26,672 --> 00:29:28,073
to sell your, to market your game to.

610
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:29,053
That's one thing.

611
00:29:29,734 --> 00:29:31,354
Do they have good distributor relationships?

612
00:29:31,554 --> 00:29:34,516
When you go on to Steam and there's like a,

613
00:29:35,136 --> 00:29:36,276
they do the publisher's weekends,

614
00:29:36,336 --> 00:29:37,777
do you see them show up as one of them?

615
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:39,838
Do you see the games be,

616
00:29:41,943 --> 00:29:45,926
featured in those, that means that they have an email, they have a contact at the publisher

617
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:47,927
that you can work and that is valuable for you.

618
00:29:49,849 --> 00:29:53,551
Do they have a good player reputation? When you go on to discussion boards, do you see

619
00:29:53,571 --> 00:29:58,435
the publishers interacting, in addition to the devs, with players? Do players respond

620
00:29:58,475 --> 00:30:04,619
positively to their games when they come out? What are the reviews? What's the situation

621
00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:05,820
for the other games that they've published?

622
00:30:08,113 --> 00:30:11,134
Do they have a good game reputation within our community as game devs?

623
00:30:11,774 --> 00:30:14,415
When you come to a conference like GDC and you say, hey, we're thinking about working

624
00:30:14,435 --> 00:30:18,337
with these guys, is the reaction, oh, yeah, they're great people, you should definitely

625
00:30:18,357 --> 00:30:21,458
work with them, or is it, you should talk to Rob?

626
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:24,419
That's not a good reaction that you get.

627
00:30:24,499 --> 00:30:27,340
So what's the reputation like within the game dev community?

628
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:30,541
And do they fund games?

629
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:31,722
Do you need the funding?

630
00:30:31,842 --> 00:30:33,863
If so, that's a very important consideration.

631
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:37,720
So there are also some parasites out there.

632
00:30:38,221 --> 00:30:43,623
So be careful and look out for these publishers who will take

633
00:30:43,663 --> 00:30:46,644
your game, tweet about it eight times on release day,

634
00:30:47,084 --> 00:30:49,746
send 20 keys to YouTubers and say, we published your game.

635
00:30:49,826 --> 00:30:51,026
That'll be 20%.

636
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:53,707
You can do that yourself and keep the 20%.

637
00:30:54,248 --> 00:30:57,549
So they also have a bad reputation among players.

638
00:30:57,609 --> 00:30:59,310
Players know who the shovelware publishers are.

639
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,731
So just avoid that, the nail on the head.

640
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:07,293
So just to summarize this section a little bit,

641
00:31:07,993 --> 00:31:11,235
self-publishing is not as easy as it used to be anymore.

642
00:31:11,895 --> 00:31:13,275
Standing out in this crowded market

643
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:16,016
where you have 6,000 games coming out next year

644
00:31:16,136 --> 00:31:18,337
is going to be even more difficult than it used to be.

645
00:31:18,998 --> 00:31:21,599
So if you're not good at it, outsource it.

646
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:23,499
It's what we would do for any other skill set

647
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:25,360
that we don't possess natively to our team.

648
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,341
And we need to start thinking about these things

649
00:31:27,381 --> 00:31:28,741
like PR, like marketing,

650
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:30,182
like how we're gonna get the eyeballs on the game

651
00:31:30,562 --> 00:31:32,503
as crucial parts of the game development process,

652
00:31:32,563 --> 00:31:34,243
not things that we'll do later once we're done.

653
00:31:36,245 --> 00:31:41,128
OK, so that said, I would like to talk about how we can work

654
00:31:41,188 --> 00:31:45,271
together better as developers, how we can change the way that

655
00:31:45,311 --> 00:31:48,713
we relate to one another within our teams, and how we can use

656
00:31:48,753 --> 00:31:52,095
that to help cut through this noise as well, and how we can

657
00:31:52,136 --> 00:31:53,436
use it to increase the number of eyeballs.

658
00:31:55,118 --> 00:31:58,740
When we're talking about getting people to pay

659
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,381
attention to us, to follow our games.

660
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,274
People follow other people.

661
00:32:02,494 --> 00:32:04,636
When I want to find a new piece of music or a new book

662
00:32:04,676 --> 00:32:07,037
or something like that, I don't follow a publisher

663
00:32:07,137 --> 00:32:08,638
or a platform or a studio.

664
00:32:09,098 --> 00:32:13,241
I follow a musician or an author or a group or a TV star.

665
00:32:13,361 --> 00:32:16,963
I follow the people who are behind making the product,

666
00:32:16,983 --> 00:32:18,424
who are behind the creative voice.

667
00:32:19,084 --> 00:32:22,386
So they stand out by emphasizing their own creative voice.

668
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,448
And we can stand out by emphasizing our creative voice.

669
00:32:26,249 --> 00:32:28,530
And as indie developers, we need to do a better job at this.

670
00:32:29,685 --> 00:32:31,627
What I'm saying is we need to find our inner Kubricks.

671
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:33,489
You can always tell a Kubrick movie,

672
00:32:33,609 --> 00:32:34,971
everybody knows that's The Shining.

673
00:32:35,611 --> 00:32:35,811
Yes?

674
00:32:36,692 --> 00:32:36,873
Hope?

675
00:32:37,393 --> 00:32:40,276
Okay, so this is sort of that iconic scene

676
00:32:40,296 --> 00:32:42,959
from The Shining where he's racing down the hallway

677
00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:44,861
on the big wheel and the camera's right behind him

678
00:32:44,941 --> 00:32:47,584
and it's sharp corners, the suspense builds

679
00:32:47,604 --> 00:32:48,926
until he runs into the creepy twins

680
00:32:48,946 --> 00:32:50,047
and they say, come play with us.

681
00:32:50,367 --> 00:32:51,749
The creepy scene, it's a very Kubrick.

682
00:32:52,765 --> 00:32:54,807
And if I tell you that a movie you haven't seen before

683
00:32:54,928 --> 00:32:57,250
is a Kubrick movie, you already know a lot about,

684
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,252
you know, Kubrick, you already know a lot about that movie

685
00:32:59,933 --> 00:33:02,775
before you even see the movie.

686
00:33:03,056 --> 00:33:04,357
We recognize Kubrick in the work.

687
00:33:04,397 --> 00:33:08,801
So how do players recognize you and me in our games?

688
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:13,228
So like if, when Cliff Harris puts out a new Puzzletech game,

689
00:33:13,648 --> 00:33:15,969
it comes out, just by knowing that it's a Cliff Harris

690
00:33:15,989 --> 00:33:18,031
Puzzletech game, I already know lots about it.

691
00:33:18,311 --> 00:33:20,393
In fact, when he put production line out for the alpha,

692
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:22,454
I bought it right away because I knew I would like it.

693
00:33:23,415 --> 00:33:24,796
When a new Zachtronics game comes out,

694
00:33:25,496 --> 00:33:27,197
know a lot about that already just because

695
00:33:28,078 --> 00:33:29,499
they've done a good job of establishing

696
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:31,400
that creative voice and that creative style.

697
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:36,889
And I'm talking about you and we as in the whole team of people, not just us as the main

698
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:40,632
developers but ourselves, the people who did our audio, the people who did our sound.

699
00:33:41,372 --> 00:33:46,116
They need credit, they need recognition because giving that to them increases everybody's

700
00:33:46,296 --> 00:33:49,518
bandwidth, increases the volume of our creative voice collectively.

701
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:54,139
And I want to take an example from a different area,

702
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:54,960
from restaurants.

703
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,420
We live in Chicago, and there are lots and lots and lots

704
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,961
and lots and lots of restaurants in Chicago,

705
00:33:59,981 --> 00:34:01,321
with new ones opening every week.

706
00:34:01,901 --> 00:34:03,102
It's a crowded volatile market

707
00:34:03,122 --> 00:34:04,642
that should sound familiar to us.

708
00:34:05,522 --> 00:34:07,343
And within Mexican restaurants,

709
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:09,083
it's an even deeper problem,

710
00:34:09,103 --> 00:34:10,283
because there are lots and lots and lots

711
00:34:10,323 --> 00:34:11,544
of Mexican restaurants in Chicago,

712
00:34:12,044 --> 00:34:12,884
so it's a crowded niche.

713
00:34:13,464 --> 00:34:14,444
And that's Chef Rick Bayless,

714
00:34:14,464 --> 00:34:15,685
who you may know from his PBS...

715
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:19,539
cooking show, and he does a really good job,

716
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,261
because he has a little empire of Mexican restaurants

717
00:34:21,461 --> 00:34:24,343
in Chicago, of cutting through the noise of restaurants.

718
00:34:25,584 --> 00:34:27,126
When he opened a new torta restaurant,

719
00:34:27,506 --> 00:34:28,927
we went there right away, not because it was

720
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:30,268
a new torta restaurant, but because it was

721
00:34:30,308 --> 00:34:31,209
Rick Bayless' restaurant.

722
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,292
And he also does a really good job of working with

723
00:34:34,972 --> 00:34:36,293
and encouraging people he works with.

724
00:34:36,454 --> 00:34:38,916
That's Anselmo Ramirez, who Rick Bayless calls

725
00:34:39,556 --> 00:34:40,297
the king of mole.

726
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:43,199
He makes the best Mexican sauces I've ever had in my life.

727
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:44,280
So.

728
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,718
and he talks about it on his cooking shows,

729
00:34:47,738 --> 00:34:49,459
in the media, whenever he's asked questions,

730
00:34:49,479 --> 00:34:51,040
like, who are you following, who are you working with?

731
00:34:51,761 --> 00:34:54,402
He encourages and promotes the people that he works with.

732
00:34:54,783 --> 00:34:56,864
So when Chef Ramirez opened a new restaurant,

733
00:34:57,024 --> 00:34:58,966
which is conveniently around the corner from my house,

734
00:35:00,507 --> 00:35:01,547
we couldn't get in for three months.

735
00:35:02,788 --> 00:35:05,910
So that kind of amplification of not just his own bandwidth,

736
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:09,713
but then helping his coworkers, his people who he works with,

737
00:35:10,553 --> 00:35:11,574
is sort of a way of you can,

738
00:35:11,774 --> 00:35:13,996
like, you know, the rising tide lifts all boats.

739
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:18,162
And that means that we need to think about

740
00:35:18,362 --> 00:35:20,503
providing an equal share in rewards as well,

741
00:35:20,663 --> 00:35:24,404
so that people who contribute to your game to its success,

742
00:35:25,404 --> 00:35:28,225
and everybody contributes to that voice,

743
00:35:28,265 --> 00:35:29,605
gets to enjoy the fruits of the labor.

744
00:35:29,725 --> 00:35:31,366
So if you're working on a contract,

745
00:35:31,426 --> 00:35:33,947
if you're working for a company,

746
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:34,807
you're getting a paycheck,

747
00:35:34,827 --> 00:35:35,927
but is it what you're passionate about?

748
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:37,939
Not necessarily.

749
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,841
How does that increase your creative voice?

750
00:35:40,062 --> 00:35:41,283
How does that get you going?

751
00:35:41,323 --> 00:35:42,384
How does that get you talking?

752
00:35:43,485 --> 00:35:45,747
And for us, that means everyone we work with,

753
00:35:45,787 --> 00:35:47,049
we work with on a rev share basis.

754
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:49,712
So that leads to a long tail of revenues

755
00:35:50,212 --> 00:35:51,914
that sort of lifts all of the boats

756
00:35:52,214 --> 00:35:54,176
and helps everyone become more independent

757
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:55,337
with each game that comes out.

758
00:35:56,158 --> 00:35:57,780
And that's abstract, so here's some specifics.

759
00:35:59,121 --> 00:35:59,782
This is the...

760
00:36:01,647 --> 00:36:02,948
sales chart for our first game, 1849.

761
00:36:02,988 --> 00:36:05,770
And we're gonna ignore that big bump at the beginning

762
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,052
and look how we have the months of sales

763
00:36:08,072 --> 00:36:08,712
that come after that.

764
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,772
That's the long tail that helped us as developers,

765
00:36:12,812 --> 00:36:14,573
but also our artists that we worked with

766
00:36:15,113 --> 00:36:17,054
make Project High Rise, which came out.

767
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:20,195
And we have, again, hopefully there's that big bump

768
00:36:20,215 --> 00:36:21,536
at the beginning, and then we're seeing the beginning

769
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:23,497
of a long tail show up.

770
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:25,738
That's going to let us, the people we worked with,

771
00:36:25,798 --> 00:36:28,159
our artists, become more independent

772
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:29,980
with each successive game that we release.

773
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,881
And more independence helps us develop our creative voice.

774
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:35,703
It helps us start to break through this noise

775
00:36:35,823 --> 00:36:36,703
together as a team.

776
00:36:37,692 --> 00:36:39,833
So these RevShare teams that we're talking about,

777
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:43,155
let's look into them a little bit more and how we do it.

778
00:36:43,395 --> 00:36:45,016
All contributors participate in the spoils.

779
00:36:45,176 --> 00:36:47,477
So we take the big chunk of money that comes in,

780
00:36:47,597 --> 00:36:48,578
hopefully it's a big chunk of money,

781
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:51,940
and it's per title, so per game that comes out,

782
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,601
and then it's done by proportional contribution.

783
00:36:54,641 --> 00:36:56,422
So my hour's worth the same as Rob's hour,

784
00:36:56,462 --> 00:36:57,783
it's worth the same as our artist's hour.

785
00:36:58,223 --> 00:37:00,044
We total the number of hours that were done,

786
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:01,225
and if I worked 35% of the hours,

787
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:01,885
I get 35% of the revenue.

788
00:37:05,445 --> 00:37:07,147
And that's worked for us for two games so far.

789
00:37:08,168 --> 00:37:10,790
And it was inspired by Randy Smith from Tiger Style,

790
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:12,532
and you can go see his talk from 2013,

791
00:37:13,973 --> 00:37:15,414
from which I stole most of the slide.

792
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:20,139
So, some challenges.

793
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:21,840
These things aren't really fish nor fowl.

794
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,902
It's not a traditional contracting relationship.

795
00:37:24,803 --> 00:37:27,445
It's not a salary, but it's somewhere in between.

796
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:29,747
So there's some challenges to this model.

797
00:37:30,088 --> 00:37:31,189
How do you find the right people?

798
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:34,500
How do you find the person who's willing to, you know,

799
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,881
work for two years and maybe get paid later?

800
00:37:37,801 --> 00:37:38,302
It's risky.

801
00:37:38,602 --> 00:37:41,603
Like, no one knows if the game's gonna succeed.

802
00:37:41,723 --> 00:37:43,764
Like one way you could do that to help mitigate things

803
00:37:43,824 --> 00:37:45,684
is to offer some sort of advance on royalties,

804
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:47,985
but then you need the money up front to do that.

805
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:49,186
And that's sometimes hard to find.

806
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:54,192
and they have to trust, you have to trust that they can deliver what they say without

807
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:59,278
the motivation, the carrot of a salary to help drive their work, and they have to trust

808
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:03,802
that you're going to deliver and that your game can make enough revenue to make it worth

809
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:08,447
their while and that you pay them and stuff. So we're really talking about a limited pool.

810
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:13,993
ex-colleagues, friends, people you know, people who you can talk into taking the Rope Share

811
00:38:14,013 --> 00:38:19,877
plunge with you. And that's kind of a problem, that local pool. We only find our collaborators

812
00:38:19,937 --> 00:38:24,901
locally. When I start working on my next game, I'll find my collaborators through people

813
00:38:24,941 --> 00:38:28,984
that I've worked with before at different jobs, different games, or through the network

814
00:38:29,004 --> 00:38:29,884
of indies in Chicago.

815
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,601
But how can we sort of shift that

816
00:38:33,621 --> 00:38:35,201
to be more global in collaboration?

817
00:38:35,322 --> 00:38:39,584
How can we find that guy who's waiting to do art

818
00:38:39,624 --> 00:38:41,405
for our game that would be perfect for it in Sweden

819
00:38:41,425 --> 00:38:42,325
that can do RevShare?

820
00:38:43,065 --> 00:38:44,706
Why do I need to know about that artist?

821
00:38:44,726 --> 00:38:45,587
They should know about me.

822
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,488
How do we shift these collaborations,

823
00:38:47,508 --> 00:38:49,629
these networks to be more global?

824
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:51,369
And unfortunately, there's not a slide

825
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:52,290
with an answer coming up.

826
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,991
That's sort of a problem that I want to put out there

827
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:56,312
for us as a community to think about.

828
00:38:56,732 --> 00:38:57,933
How can we start to shift?

829
00:38:59,095 --> 00:39:03,977
the way that we work from our local networks to more global networks. So that's something

830
00:39:03,997 --> 00:39:07,498
I want to leave you with today and hopefully start a conversation about that going forward.

831
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:14,940
So sort of to wrap up this section a little bit, our players want our game, hopefully,

832
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:18,341
not just any game. They want the game that we're putting out next that we've been talking

833
00:39:18,381 --> 00:39:24,402
about, that we've been encouraging our artists, our audio people, our whole team to talk about

834
00:39:24,722 --> 00:39:27,923
and get passionate about and to really develop our next game.

835
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,102
And independence is what lets us develop that creative voice.

836
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,224
Being Indies is our strength.

837
00:39:34,264 --> 00:39:36,005
It's what's going to help us get through the noise.

838
00:39:36,045 --> 00:39:37,586
It's not what's going to keep us from getting through it.

839
00:39:37,947 --> 00:39:40,168
By emphasizing and maintaining our independence,

840
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:42,230
that's what's going to help us get through the noise.

841
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:44,652
That's what's going to help us cut through this 6,000 games

842
00:39:44,672 --> 00:39:45,693
that are coming out next year.

843
00:39:46,313 --> 00:39:47,514
We need to maintain that.

844
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:48,355
We need to strengthen it.

845
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:49,316
We need to reinforce it.

846
00:39:51,017 --> 00:39:52,258
And again, that distinct voice

847
00:39:52,298 --> 00:39:53,659
is what's going to let us get through the noise.

848
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:57,823
So, we're gonna wrap up with whatever that is

849
00:39:59,025 --> 00:40:01,048
and look at a few conclusions

850
00:40:01,088 --> 00:40:02,230
before we jump to some questions

851
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,793
which we've hopefully left enough time for.

852
00:40:03,813 --> 00:40:06,237
I think you can summarize our...

853
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:13,589
talk by the theme of the following. Noise changes everything. The number of games that

854
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:17,671
have come out last year and in the past few years and that we're going to see coming,

855
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:21,853
we can't stop. They're going to add on to the games that are already out there. The

856
00:40:21,894 --> 00:40:26,696
noise level is going to increase dramatically in the coming years. How do we deal with that?

857
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:30,038
Hopefully we come up with some suggestions today that can help us deal with that.

858
00:40:31,044 --> 00:40:33,926
You need to develop a unique voice that players will seek out.

859
00:40:34,166 --> 00:40:37,969
Structure your team so that everybody that you work with becomes more independent.

860
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:43,113
Structure your team so that we're all becoming more independent as we go forward and all

861
00:40:43,133 --> 00:40:44,354
developing that creative voice.

862
00:40:46,096 --> 00:40:47,557
Find partners to amplify your voice.

863
00:40:48,257 --> 00:40:53,061
If you're bad at PR, if you're bad at marketing, if you're bad at those things like I am,

864
00:40:55,192 --> 00:40:56,933
Those skill sets aren't native to your team.

865
00:40:57,053 --> 00:40:58,193
Find people who can help you.

866
00:40:58,273 --> 00:40:59,513
Find people who can do that.

867
00:40:59,653 --> 00:41:02,674
It's an important core skill set in this new world.

868
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,476
And finally, we need to plan for how players

869
00:41:07,516 --> 00:41:08,656
are gonna find our games

870
00:41:08,896 --> 00:41:11,457
from the very first commit of code to our game.

871
00:41:11,897 --> 00:41:14,038
We need to know how they're going to get through the store,

872
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:15,298
how a player's gonna find them,

873
00:41:16,478 --> 00:41:18,499
how are we going to do that kind of discoverability,

874
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:21,620
not later on, but as we're developing the game

875
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,400
from those very early concept stages.

876
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:26,513
So hopefully we now know how we can survive

877
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:28,914
this post-apocalyptic world a little bit better,

878
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:30,754
and we'd welcome some questions,

879
00:41:31,174 --> 00:41:32,155
and you should all come see us in Chicago.

880
00:41:32,175 --> 00:41:33,635
Thank you.

881
00:41:33,675 --> 00:41:33,975
Thank you.

882
00:41:33,995 --> 00:41:34,695
Thank you.

883
00:41:34,715 --> 00:41:35,095
Thank you.

884
00:41:35,235 --> 00:41:35,756
Thank you.

885
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:36,236
Thank you.

886
00:41:36,276 --> 00:41:36,476
Thank you.

887
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:36,696
Thank you.

888
00:41:36,716 --> 00:41:36,996
Thank you.

889
00:41:37,016 --> 00:41:37,436
Thank you.

890
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:37,696
Thank you.

891
00:41:37,796 --> 00:41:38,196
Thank you.

892
00:41:38,376 --> 00:41:44,138
Thank you.

893
00:41:44,158 --> 00:41:45,218
So if anyone has any questions,

894
00:41:45,258 --> 00:41:46,798
please go to the mic in the center aisle.

895
00:41:58,159 --> 00:41:58,279
Hi.

896
00:41:58,699 --> 00:41:59,680
Hey.

897
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:05,644
So you mentioned following people as opposed to following brands, but then you also mentioned

898
00:42:06,205 --> 00:42:09,046
collective voice of a studio as opposed to an individual voice.

899
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,088
How do you put those two together?

900
00:42:11,108 --> 00:42:16,411
I mean, I think we're looking at it sort of from the indie perspective, like, you know,

901
00:42:16,571 --> 00:42:17,632
this is our studio.

902
00:42:18,373 --> 00:42:19,173
And I think...

903
00:42:20,633 --> 00:42:22,094
we have to look at it more like a band,

904
00:42:22,134 --> 00:42:23,735
like we're a band, you know,

905
00:42:23,855 --> 00:42:25,795
like we're people who've come together to make this album

906
00:42:26,416 --> 00:42:27,076
and that's our game.

907
00:42:27,916 --> 00:42:29,797
So I think, you know, we're not talking about

908
00:42:31,077 --> 00:42:33,898
like a big studio, like Blizzard or something like that.

909
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:36,779
Like, you know, think of yourselves more like a band

910
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:39,080
and, you know, everybody knows the guitarist,

911
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,020
the drummer and stuff like that.

912
00:42:40,401 --> 00:42:41,821
So I think we need to think more like that.

913
00:42:41,901 --> 00:42:43,822
Like there's the drummer, there's the guitarist,

914
00:42:43,842 --> 00:42:44,562
there's the lead singer.

915
00:42:44,882 --> 00:42:46,843
And we're all sort of coming together as a band

916
00:42:46,903 --> 00:42:48,083
to make an album, which is our game.

917
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:53,259
And actually, if I can follow up on that, I think it works in both ways.

918
00:42:53,459 --> 00:42:56,661
And there's a point about what to focus on.

919
00:42:57,362 --> 00:43:01,785
For some people, it might be a single person who's sort of fronting everything

920
00:43:01,825 --> 00:43:05,227
and they're developing their recognition.

921
00:43:06,087 --> 00:43:10,010
For teams, like for example, Zetronix came up before.

922
00:43:11,011 --> 00:43:15,815
And that's one person who works with collaborators, so it works behind a team name.

923
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,617
And I think these both work.

924
00:43:18,518 --> 00:43:21,481
The major distinction is that they have a recognizable voice.

925
00:43:22,342 --> 00:43:25,565
These are not teams that, for example, switch from genre to genre.

926
00:43:25,585 --> 00:43:26,946
They don't try a lot of...

927
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:32,071
they don't have an unrecognizable style.

928
00:43:32,091 --> 00:43:34,633
They have a style and the style hides, not hides,

929
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,635
but is represented either by a team name

930
00:43:36,735 --> 00:43:37,796
or by a person name.

931
00:43:37,836 --> 00:43:40,818
And that's the recognition of a style is the important part.

932
00:43:41,999 --> 00:43:42,279
Thank you.

933
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:48,905
Yeah.

934
00:43:48,925 --> 00:43:49,946
All right.

935
00:43:51,006 --> 00:43:53,308
So you talk about how new school publishers

936
00:43:53,428 --> 00:43:56,311
are not funding games in the same way

937
00:43:56,351 --> 00:43:57,532
that old school publishers were.

938
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,501
And you also talk about how there's, on Steam at least,

939
00:44:00,561 --> 00:44:03,022
a linear increase in consumers versus a quadratic increase

940
00:44:03,062 --> 00:44:05,202
in the supply of games.

941
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:09,464
This seems to imply that market forces

942
00:44:09,484 --> 00:44:11,505
are going to squeeze out a lot of people

943
00:44:11,525 --> 00:44:16,247
who have less money, and that, or it could happen.

944
00:44:18,368 --> 00:44:20,128
And that most of the games that are gonna be able

945
00:44:20,148 --> 00:44:21,929
to achieve success are games that are gonna be made

946
00:44:21,969 --> 00:44:23,830
by people who are basically richer.

947
00:44:27,553 --> 00:44:32,855
a lot of people cannot afford to work for two years on the promise of revenue.

948
00:44:34,455 --> 00:44:39,897
Some amount of capital is needed and if publishers are not providing it, where can that capital

949
00:44:39,957 --> 00:44:41,937
come from in this current world?

950
00:44:42,317 --> 00:44:47,999
There's been a lot of hand-wringing about the viability of crowdfunding and what not

951
00:44:48,379 --> 00:44:51,220
and in particular how it's not viable.

952
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,140
It's not something that you guys have really touched on at all.

953
00:44:53,881 --> 00:44:54,861
I'm wondering if you had any thoughts.

954
00:44:55,161 --> 00:45:00,168
Yeah, I mean, in a certain sense it's a very similar situation to how it's been all along, right?

955
00:45:00,228 --> 00:45:07,679
That for indies it's really hard to find funding, and people end up self-funding because they have to.

956
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,701
And sometimes when you have...

957
00:45:10,962 --> 00:45:13,743
Sometimes you might be able to get something like PR

958
00:45:13,763 --> 00:45:17,524
marketing help and so on on a ref share basis, for example.

959
00:45:17,644 --> 00:45:22,305
So you don't have to pay up front, but the PR person will

960
00:45:22,325 --> 00:45:23,385
take a cut of the cost.

961
00:45:23,786 --> 00:45:26,726
But the problem of getting funding for a game is always a

962
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:27,046
hard one.

963
00:45:27,406 --> 00:45:31,407
It used to be much easier to, if you made a game, to then

964
00:45:34,048 --> 00:45:39,150
release it without publishing and recoup the costs in an easier way, but now it's harder.

965
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:46,153
So I guess the answer to that is that like in any other small business,

966
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:50,514
you need to have some kind of seed capital to start with.

967
00:45:51,395 --> 00:45:53,797
And I mean, that ends up being somebody's savings, right?

968
00:45:54,178 --> 00:45:56,420
Whether it's savings being spent on a contractor,

969
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,982
whether it's savings being spent on rent

970
00:45:58,362 --> 00:46:00,345
while you work in your basement for two years, right?

971
00:46:01,226 --> 00:46:04,149
I don't think there's a good way to get around that,

972
00:46:04,209 --> 00:46:05,750
but also I don't think there's ever been a good way

973
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:07,212
to get around that, unfortunately.

974
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:08,393
Thank you.

975
00:46:12,287 --> 00:46:15,732
I've got a two-part question for Dr. Z.

976
00:46:16,633 --> 00:46:24,965
You had suggested that increasingly getting surface for algorithmic recommendations was

977
00:46:25,205 --> 00:46:27,489
an area of focus and it's going to be increasingly important on STEAM.

978
00:46:28,009 --> 00:46:29,271
How do you know that you're succeeding on that?

979
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:31,254
Do you get impression or funnel statistics

980
00:46:31,815 --> 00:46:32,976
from recommendation servicing?

981
00:46:33,477 --> 00:46:35,540
The second part is you had mentioned

982
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,942
that it favors niche games.

983
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,105
Seems like a lot of recent innovation has come

984
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:40,146
from like genre mashups.

985
00:46:40,287 --> 00:46:43,131
How do you succeed in getting a mashup recommended?

986
00:46:43,903 --> 00:46:49,165
Yeah, so to answer the first question, there are no numbers

987
00:46:49,205 --> 00:46:51,186
publicly available right now, unfortunately.

988
00:46:51,306 --> 00:46:52,507
So we can't do

989
00:46:52,527 --> 00:46:53,227
It's a guessing game.

990
00:46:53,967 --> 00:46:55,648
Yeah, we can't really do analytics on that.

991
00:46:56,068 --> 00:46:57,609
I would love it if there were numbers.

992
00:46:57,629 --> 00:46:58,849
I mean, that would be so amazing.

993
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:02,851
So I think one thing that's going to be useful going

994
00:47:02,872 --> 00:47:05,473
forward is using a service like Steam Swipe, for example.

995
00:47:05,873 --> 00:47:11,217
You can collect, for example, data on how many games are

996
00:47:11,317 --> 00:47:14,779
tagged with different tags and what their sales were like.

997
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,021
And you could potentially do your own manual matchup of

998
00:47:18,081 --> 00:47:21,904
like, hey, games that are strategy simulation have been

999
00:47:21,944 --> 00:47:24,906
growing, and games that are strategy farming 2D racing

1000
00:47:24,986 --> 00:47:25,726
have been declining.

1001
00:47:26,627 --> 00:47:30,050
But that's not gonna be possible at least for another year

1002
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:31,971
because Steam has only recently been

1003
00:47:34,974 --> 00:47:36,675
getting really, you know, doubling down

1004
00:47:36,695 --> 00:47:37,956
on this algorithmic recommendation.

1005
00:47:38,257 --> 00:47:39,698
And I apologize, I forgot the second one.

1006
00:47:40,678 --> 00:47:41,859
Sorry, second question is like,

1007
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:45,481
you had mentioned that recommendations

1008
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:47,621
favor niche-based games.

1009
00:47:48,882 --> 00:47:50,443
And it seems like that's counter to a lot

1010
00:47:50,483 --> 00:47:53,004
of recent innovation that's been really mashup-based.

1011
00:47:53,324 --> 00:47:54,985
Like, how do you build a mashup

1012
00:47:55,245 --> 00:47:56,485
that can also get recommended?

1013
00:47:56,705 --> 00:47:57,446
I guess is the question.

1014
00:47:57,466 --> 00:47:59,468
And maybe it's more rhetorical, like it's hard.

1015
00:48:00,029 --> 00:48:01,470
It's a finance error.

1016
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:05,455
I think you have to start in a niche that's already strong

1017
00:48:05,495 --> 00:48:07,517
and then hopefully that sort of broadens out.

1018
00:48:07,977 --> 00:48:09,899
Like I think you still have to try to target

1019
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,060
the niche to begin with.

1020
00:48:11,761 --> 00:48:13,722
And then hopefully that allows you to broaden out.

1021
00:48:13,762 --> 00:48:16,784
And as it gets more pick up and more word of mouth in

1022
00:48:16,824 --> 00:48:18,865
other communities, then hopefully you can leverage

1023
00:48:18,885 --> 00:48:19,386
other community.

1024
00:48:19,706 --> 00:48:21,987
I think you'd be strongest by trying to focus on your

1025
00:48:22,408 --> 00:48:25,529
coordination and then move to the neighboring one and start

1026
00:48:25,649 --> 00:48:27,391
to take over the neighbors.

1027
00:48:27,411 --> 00:48:30,192
And that looks to me like we're out of time.

1028
00:48:30,392 --> 00:48:31,813
Yeah, looks like that wraps it up.

1029
00:48:31,893 --> 00:48:34,175
