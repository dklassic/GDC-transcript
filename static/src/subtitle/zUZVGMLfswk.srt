1
00:00:04,628 --> 00:00:11,272
Hi everyone. Does it work? Alright, thank you guys so much for coming. I'm so glad to be here.

2
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:15,715
I'm Armin Ibrisagich. I work as a game designer and PR manager at Coffee Stain.

3
00:00:16,536 --> 00:00:19,377
I was supposed to tell you guys something before I started. It was...

4
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:25,021
Turn cellphones on silent.

5
00:00:28,944 --> 00:00:31,265
And there was one other thing, right? Did I forget something?

6
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:33,435
Evaluation, yeah.

7
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:34,295
What was that?

8
00:00:34,356 --> 00:00:36,116
Yeah, remember to give evaluations, right?

9
00:00:37,096 --> 00:00:39,897
And hopefully remember to give good evaluations.

10
00:00:42,298 --> 00:00:43,979
Anyway, I'm here to talk about Goat Simulator.

11
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:46,019
I'm here to talk about basically

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,080
the marketing lessons that I've learned.

13
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:50,661
It's been a hell of a ride,

14
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:53,382
and I'm happy to share them with you guys.

15
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:57,463
So actually, I started out as a level design intern,

16
00:00:57,963 --> 00:00:58,303
initially.

17
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:07,571
on Magica. Right after that I got a job at Coffee Scene Studios. I was doing level design,

18
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:12,754
game design, that kind of stuff, and when my contract was about to expire, they were

19
00:01:13,254 --> 00:01:21,619
looking for someone who could do PR, and I pretended that I knew how to do PR, so I got

20
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:24,320
the chance to do that, and so I basically learned what I was doing.

21
00:01:27,325 --> 00:01:33,451
That's my background. I don't have any actual PR education, but in some ways I think that's actually a good thing.

22
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:44,581
So CoffeeStain in 2013, we're in a really tricky situation. We had just finished Sanctum 2, which was like our biggest IP back then.

23
00:01:45,943 --> 00:01:50,006
We had been working on Sanctum for two years, I think, in total.

24
00:01:50,927 --> 00:01:52,988
and then Sanctum 2 for another two years.

25
00:01:53,048 --> 00:01:55,650
So we were pretty, we weren't sick of our game,

26
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,071
but we felt that we wanted to do something different.

27
00:01:59,112 --> 00:02:01,133
So we prepared to start a whole new IP

28
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,635
that was gonna be like our next big game

29
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:04,595
that we're gonna work on.

30
00:02:06,016 --> 00:02:07,217
Which wasn't Goat Simulator though.

31
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:08,858
It was something totally different.

32
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,160
This really big game that we were planning to make.

33
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,201
And basically we just had a one month game jam

34
00:02:16,362 --> 00:02:18,803
for people that weren't involved in pre-production.

35
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:21,824
So we could basically just play around, do whatever we wanted.

36
00:02:21,844 --> 00:02:25,426
I pitched Goat Simulator as an idea

37
00:02:25,586 --> 00:02:29,728
and luckily I got some people that started working on it with me.

38
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,831
And that's how the game started.

39
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:40,973
During the early days of Goat Simulator, we weren't really planning on making a big game.

40
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,935
We mostly focused on playing around, learning new tools.

41
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:50,417
We bought all the 3D assets from the internet, because it's not like we're going to release it anyway.

42
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:53,278
It's just a stupid goat game.

43
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:57,840
And the project was really relaxed, it wasn't that serious.

44
00:02:58,281 --> 00:03:03,643
You would basically just go to work, work on whatever you felt like doing, and put it in the game.

45
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:07,226
No one was keeping track of what was in the game.

46
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:08,607
You know how game gems are.

47
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,631
So it wasn't really super serious.

48
00:03:13,452 --> 00:03:14,212
This was our planning.

49
00:03:14,332 --> 00:03:17,796
I know this is in, I'm from Sweden, this is moose talk.

50
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:20,718
But I can translate it to you.

51
00:03:20,778 --> 00:03:23,981
Basically just says, first week a goat,

52
00:03:25,183 --> 00:03:26,464
other week a goat that moves.

53
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:30,708
Then I got the moves on a level, then I got that can do a trick and so on.

54
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:32,670
That was basically our planning.

55
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,975
So it wasn't really, there wasn't really anything that was solid or set in stone.

56
00:03:39,216 --> 00:03:44,201
And you knew basically what you should be working on, but it was still really free

57
00:03:44,221 --> 00:03:46,863
and you could do pretty much whatever you wanted.

58
00:03:48,738 --> 00:03:56,102
Then one day I put up a really short video of gameplay on YouTube and just over one night

59
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:57,782
it had like, it just exploded.

60
00:03:57,962 --> 00:04:01,104
I went to sleep and when I woke up it was like all over my Facebook feed.

61
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:06,266
We got, I think it has like 6 million views now or something, it was insane.

62
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:13,910
We were never used to having this much eyes on us and this much attention.

63
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:18,251
So our main thing was that we were, we just felt like,

64
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:19,932
how do we not mess this up?

65
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:22,192
Because obviously there's a lot of people looking at us,

66
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:24,273
we have a lot of cool things that we,

67
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:27,634
a lot of potential customers,

68
00:04:29,274 --> 00:04:32,115
and how do we do something, make something good out of this?

69
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:33,696
Because the game was still,

70
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:37,036
it was like three or four weeks into development.

71
00:04:38,417 --> 00:04:40,539
It was pretty scary.

72
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:45,583
But later on, we felt like, we basically took everyone from our other projects, we're 20

73
00:04:45,803 --> 00:04:51,728
employees at Coffee Stain, we took everyone, put them on Gold Simulator, we kept adding

74
00:04:51,768 --> 00:04:56,151
content into the game, but we still figured that we don't want to do any, we don't want

75
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,514
to transition into a serious game, we still wanted to keep the playful kind of style.

76
00:05:00,715 --> 00:05:02,036
I'm sure we could have, you know...

77
00:05:03,546 --> 00:05:05,347
we had a couple million views on our YouTube trailer.

78
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:07,148
We could have gone to a publisher and be like,

79
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:09,669
oh hey, give us this much money,

80
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,231
we'll make a triple A goat game for $60.

81
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:16,693
It'll be GTA with goats.

82
00:05:17,073 --> 00:05:18,694
But that wasn't really the spirit of the game,

83
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:20,094
because I think the game went viral

84
00:05:20,134 --> 00:05:23,276
because it was so small and so stupid and kind of buggy.

85
00:05:23,296 --> 00:05:29,819
So we just wanted to keep going in the same spirit

86
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,900
that the first trailer was.

87
00:05:34,462 --> 00:05:38,514
The giraffe thing. So I was doing an interview with a journalist.

88
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,489
And they always ask the same questions.

89
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:44,230
They ask me, why do you play a goat?

90
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,751
Why don't you play a giraffe or a bear or something?

91
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:49,032
And I was getting pretty tired of the questions.

92
00:05:49,152 --> 00:05:51,973
I was like, well, you know, giraffes are just basically

93
00:05:52,053 --> 00:05:55,014
really tall goats, and bears are just really fluffy goats.

94
00:05:56,115 --> 00:06:00,797
And as I was going back to my desk, I figured, you know,

95
00:06:00,817 --> 00:06:03,278
wait a second, maybe there's something here.

96
00:06:06,612 --> 00:06:09,317
So I went to our animator and I asked him,

97
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,522
if I would buy a giraffe off of the internet,

98
00:06:13,223 --> 00:06:14,365
would you have time to animate it?

99
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:16,488
And since we had no planning, he was like,

100
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:17,650
yeah, sure, I can do it tomorrow.

101
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:23,932
So we did. At the end of the week we had a playable giraffe, and as soon as you could

102
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:31,215
play the giraffe we were just like, yes, this is perfect, we gotta do this. And now unlockable

103
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:36,978
goats are like a huge part of the game. If you google tall goat, there's actually a picture

104
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:37,438
of a giraffe.

105
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,280
But we decided that there's no freaking out allowed.

106
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,361
We still got to do it in the same way as the game was from the start.

107
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:52,142
We knew that reviewers wouldn't like it.

108
00:06:52,482 --> 00:06:55,463
You know how they grade games?

109
00:06:55,523 --> 00:07:01,224
They're like, gameplay is 7 out of 10, graphics 6 out of 10, audio.

110
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:05,805
And if you play Goat Simulator like that, then you don't really get the game.

111
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:12,136
So we just didn't bother. We just didn't get in touch with reviewers.

112
00:07:12,236 --> 00:07:16,423
They would ask me for keys and I just wouldn't even answer them back.

113
00:07:17,299 --> 00:07:22,203
We actually tried to calm down the hype, which, you know, people are always like,

114
00:07:22,263 --> 00:07:26,146
oh, I know what you're doing, you're doing like reverse psychology.

115
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:26,627
Not at all.

116
00:07:27,367 --> 00:07:32,571
We just felt like there were people that we had comments on our YouTube video.

117
00:07:33,031 --> 00:07:35,393
And people were like, oh, I can't wait till this.

118
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:40,777
I can't wait till you guys add animal control in the game and like helicopters

119
00:07:40,797 --> 00:07:43,560
like in GTA. And we don't even have any A.I.

120
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,660
Like the reason that.

121
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:52,684
NPCs just run in a random direction in Goat Simulator and trip over buckets and everything on the floor

122
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:56,326
is because they have no pathfinding, they just run somewhere and then they trip over.

123
00:07:57,767 --> 00:08:01,669
So there's no chance that we're going to have time to put that in the game anyway.

124
00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:05,511
So we felt that we wanted to calm down people and be like,

125
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:11,093
okay, relax, this is going to be a game that you play for an hour and you have fun and that's it.

126
00:08:11,214 --> 00:08:11,914
It's not going to be the...

127
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:15,576
next GTA except with goats.

128
00:08:16,936 --> 00:08:18,417
And also the bottom line is,

129
00:08:20,558 --> 00:08:23,740
sometimes like people, when I'm at PAX and stuff like that,

130
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,261
people walk up to me and they're like,

131
00:08:27,522 --> 00:08:28,583
sell me on Goat Simulator.

132
00:08:28,983 --> 00:08:31,804
And I'm always like, there's no sunshine

133
00:08:31,884 --> 00:08:33,865
I can blow up your ass that will make you like the game.

134
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:36,967
If the name Goat Simulator doesn't excite you,

135
00:08:37,027 --> 00:08:38,428
then there's nothing I can do.

136
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:41,510
And you probably hate having fun.

137
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:47,657
But I feel like it was really, really important that people knew what they got and they knew

138
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:51,820
what they were buying and that they didn't, you know, jump into the game and be like,

139
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:56,523
oh this is just, you just play a goat and do stupid things, because that's the game.

140
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:05,169
Anyway, when we released the game, it sold great, it outsold all our other games in a

141
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:06,550
matter of days, I think.

142
00:09:07,751 --> 00:09:12,093
We noticed that we don't actually need journalists to like our game.

143
00:09:12,133 --> 00:09:14,934
We got terrible reviews. We got like one out of ten.

144
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:17,875
They told us that we were the worst game ever.

145
00:09:19,236 --> 00:09:21,177
But we still sold really well.

146
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:24,999
So we figured that we don't need journalists to like our game.

147
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:26,579
We just need them to talk about it.

148
00:09:26,739 --> 00:09:29,321
And then you can let players decide whether they like it or not.

149
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:37,546
The funny thing is that we would get reviews that were like one out of ten. This is terrible and

150
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:42,590
Then they'd notice I talked to journalists and then be like oh a goat simulator

151
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:48,095
Reviews even though they're terrible they get like three times as many hits as other

152
00:09:48,815 --> 00:09:55,040
Articles they get like so many more comments. I suppose because it's a very polarizing game either you hate it or you love it

153
00:09:56,341 --> 00:10:00,765
And so we would have journalists that would give us one out of ten and say this this sucks

154
00:10:00,825 --> 00:10:04,648
No one should play it and then they started putting up articles like you know

155
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:07,871
This is how you find all the goats in goat simulator

156
00:10:08,472 --> 00:10:12,415
Most fun places to go in goat simulator because they noticed that they were getting hits, right?

157
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:14,176
So that was funny

158
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:18,179
I would just send them this picture, I don't care.

159
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:24,684
When we released the game, I remember when I wrote the key features for Sanctum 2,

160
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:27,686
and I was so nervous, it was like the first time I was doing it,

161
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:33,971
and it took like weeks, I was writing it, I was correcting every single word,

162
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:37,513
nothing can be wrong, you know, exchange this word to this other word,

163
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:41,576
because this other word sounds more action-related.

164
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:46,340
But for Goat Simulator, I didn't have time for Goat Simulator, so I just wrote like, you know,

165
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:48,282
you can be a goat, you do stupid things.

166
00:10:49,323 --> 00:10:54,027
And I didn't actually, I was like, okay, this will work for now,

167
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,409
and then when the game releases, I'll maybe change it later.

168
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,974
And as soon as I updated it on Steam, it got up on the first page of Reddit.

169
00:11:03,514 --> 00:11:08,118
Because people thought that it was so funny that we were actually being honest with, you know, what our game is about.

170
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,920
and we weren't trying to sell people our game.

171
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,561
Because that's what I tried to do with Sanctum 2.

172
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:17,285
We were like, you know, we have 16 maps and eight weapons

173
00:11:17,405 --> 00:11:21,788
and this many enemies and a high-speed action game,

174
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,650
shoot things, but with Ghost Simulator,

175
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,952
we were just like, you know, it's a dumb game

176
00:11:27,192 --> 00:11:29,494
and if you like dumb stuff, you're gonna like it.

177
00:11:30,214 --> 00:11:32,836
If not, then no problem at all, save your money.

178
00:11:32,856 --> 00:11:34,497
It's probably better that you save your money anyway.

179
00:11:36,752 --> 00:11:42,534
So after this happened, I settled on a kind of a PR policy for the game.

180
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,336
I decided that we're going to focus on our community.

181
00:11:47,116 --> 00:11:49,337
We're not going to focus on scoring high reviews with the press,

182
00:11:49,397 --> 00:11:52,258
because they're not going to like it anyway, so, you know, why bother?

183
00:11:53,098 --> 00:11:56,299
We're not going to oversell, because it's just not consistent with the game.

184
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,539
It's not that type of game.

185
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,601
Controversial articles are better than good reviews,

186
00:12:01,861 --> 00:12:03,541
because controversial articles get...

187
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:11,964
If an article makes you angry, then you link it to your friends, or you link it in your Skype chat, or you talk about it with people on Reddit.

188
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:22,406
And if there's actual discussion to be made, then people can talk in the comments, and they engage much more with actual articles.

189
00:12:23,547 --> 00:12:30,369
And, again, when I wrote the press releases for Sanctum 2, I was trying to make it as

190
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:33,330
shiny and as blingy and cool as possible.

191
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:41,773
But in Goat Simulator, basically the only important thing was to make short quotes that

192
00:12:41,793 --> 00:12:47,175
describe the game, and short feature lists instead of trying to impress people.

193
00:12:49,924 --> 00:12:53,667
We did a, I don't know if you're aware, we did an MMO expansion.

194
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:57,230
There's some background info for that.

195
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,452
We got a lot of requests to add multiplayer to our game,

196
00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:04,555
which is impossible because you can't add multiplayer into Gold Simulator.

197
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:06,816
We would have to remake the game from scratch,

198
00:13:07,157 --> 00:13:08,037
would take us two years,

199
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:09,759
and when we would add it,

200
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,661
we would probably have to add it for free, right?

201
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:15,162
And when we would add it, people would just be like, oh, is...

202
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,224
Are people still playing this? Is this still relevant?

203
00:13:19,645 --> 00:13:23,527
So, you know, we could never do multiplayer, but we could do a fake MMO.

204
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:29,310
So we made a fake MMO with like scripted goats that ran around.

205
00:13:30,151 --> 00:13:36,814
We had a chat that me and another designer scripted where, you know, fake players would yell at each other.

206
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:38,315
You know, they would sell...

207
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:43,978
iron swords for 12 gold and they would call each other nerds and idiots and you

208
00:13:44,018 --> 00:13:50,602
know don't trust razor killer 33 he's a scammer he stole my gold all that kind

209
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,904
of stuff and we would actually have people who thought it was a real MMO so

210
00:13:54,244 --> 00:13:58,446
obviously it worked we would have to add it for free though because we were

211
00:13:58,466 --> 00:14:03,769
scared that we were gonna get sued and the feature list in the MMO was also

212
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:04,710
like really stupid

213
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:10,532
You can play a warrior, rouge, magician, hunter in a microwave.

214
00:14:12,372 --> 00:14:16,933
Level cap was... so we released this right when World of Warcraft released their...

215
00:14:17,934 --> 00:14:20,334
What was it? Warlords of Draenor?

216
00:14:22,635 --> 00:14:25,656
And they increased their level cap from 90 to 100.

217
00:14:26,456 --> 00:14:29,817
So we had to make it 101. We had 100 actually.

218
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:34,278
But then like, I think, two or three days before release, they announced their...

219
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,223
I saw their level cap two or three days before we released,

220
00:14:40,683 --> 00:14:41,944
and I went to a programmer and I was like,

221
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,685
can you change it to 101?

222
00:14:42,745 --> 00:14:44,807
He was like, yeah, no problem.

223
00:14:44,827 --> 00:14:46,548
It's like, you know, one minute of work.

224
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,150
So we put level cap 101.

225
00:14:51,972 --> 00:14:54,833
And that was actually a thing that was quoted a lot.

226
00:14:55,554 --> 00:14:57,855
We got featured on Engadget, which have like,

227
00:14:57,935 --> 00:15:01,156
they have like 1.5 million followers on Twitter

228
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:01,696
or something.

229
00:15:02,357 --> 00:15:07,039
And it came out, I think it came out like the same week

230
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,920
that World of Warcraft released their expansion.

231
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,201
And in the press release, I think we wrote something like,

232
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:20,206
We apologized to the employees at Blizzard if they see any decrease in sales

233
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:23,888
because we released our MMO expansion at the same time as them.

234
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:25,970
That was quoted a lot too.

235
00:15:28,376 --> 00:15:34,417
We made a zombie expansion later on, and by then I had learned this, you know, quotable thing.

236
00:15:35,377 --> 00:15:43,759
So the first thing that we have, like the main motto we had was that it was the only survival game on Steam that isn't in early access.

237
00:15:44,479 --> 00:15:50,500
And that probably isn't true, I'm sure there's tons of games that aren't in early access that are survival games.

238
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,481
But, you know, it's not important, that's not the point we're trying to make.

239
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,262
We're just trying to kind of make fun of people.

240
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:01,635
You can craft anything you want as long as it's one of the half dozen weapons in the game.

241
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:13,180
And that was also, when you have a short sentence that people can share, and that's interesting

242
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,362
in some way, it can be funny, but it doesn't have to be.

243
00:16:16,203 --> 00:16:21,788
I know that everyone doesn't make farm animal simulators, but you can, as long as it's something

244
00:16:21,808 --> 00:16:28,654
that's short and kind of shareable, then it goes out so much easier than when you try

245
00:16:28,694 --> 00:16:29,855
to do something like, you know.

246
00:16:31,036 --> 00:16:36,758
We have 44 maps. What's 44 maps? How large is a map? How long does it take to play a map?

247
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:42,121
Is it like a super meat boy map that takes 10 seconds or is it like you play for hours?

248
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:46,663
It doesn't tell you very much, but when you have a short message that people can relate to

249
00:16:46,743 --> 00:16:51,945
and that they can share with each other, then it's so much easier to reach out to people

250
00:16:51,985 --> 00:16:54,827
and it's so much easier to, you know, gather them at one place.

251
00:16:57,148 --> 00:16:59,910
And that was also really, that worked really well.

252
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,170
I'm going to talk more about Reddit later,

253
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,872
because it's been a really big help for us.

254
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:09,095
So basically, you know, the best press release

255
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:11,756
is as short as possible.

256
00:17:12,077 --> 00:17:15,158
One sentence about the game, feature list, press kit.

257
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,619
There's nothing else you need.

258
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,521
Maybe a quote from you that would make a good headline.

259
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:27,686
and I've learned that you shouldn't try too hard to make press excited about your game

260
00:17:28,106 --> 00:17:33,330
because I think the truth is that press is... I'm sure that press people are excited about games

261
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:37,553
but they see, you know, they get like a hundred press releases a day

262
00:17:38,313 --> 00:17:41,855
and it's... they can't be excited about every single game

263
00:17:42,156 --> 00:17:46,018
so it's better to just give them something that's easy that they can copy-paste

264
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:48,039
and just put it on their site

265
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,882
something that's fast rather than trying to sell them or win them over in some way.

266
00:17:57,703 --> 00:18:02,705
Say something about YouTubers. A lot of people ask me how do YouTubers fit into this.

267
00:18:03,505 --> 00:18:07,886
I think YouTubers aren't, isn't anything, isn't related to PR.

268
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:13,089
There's nothing you can say to a YouTuber that will make him want to play your game,

269
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,791
if he doesn't find it interesting, especially the big ones.

270
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:18,633
I mean, PewDiePie is like, you know, he doesn't care.

271
00:18:18,853 --> 00:18:20,554
He has 40 million subscribers, you know.

272
00:18:21,855 --> 00:18:26,377
You can't be like, oh, I'll give you a Steam code.

273
00:18:26,878 --> 00:18:28,679
He can buy all the games on Steam that he wants.

274
00:18:28,699 --> 00:18:32,081
I think if you want YouTubers to play your game...

275
00:18:32,942 --> 00:18:37,326
That's a game design question. It has nothing to do with marketing, it has nothing to do with PR.

276
00:18:37,726 --> 00:18:40,549
When people play your game on YouTube, it helps your marketing and PR.

277
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:47,576
But it's nothing that you can, as a PR manager, that can't be your responsibility.

278
00:18:47,616 --> 00:18:49,999
Because that should be the game designer's responsibility.

279
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:55,484
To not only make a game that's fun to play, but also make a game that's fun to watch when someone is playing it.

280
00:18:58,427 --> 00:19:01,791
So we noticed that most of our community seemed to gather on Facebook.

281
00:19:02,412 --> 00:19:05,916
We got like 80,000 likes the first couple of weeks.

282
00:19:07,298 --> 00:19:14,106
On Sanctum we had like 20,000 likes for years and we tried so hard to increase them.

283
00:19:15,026 --> 00:19:18,047
We'd go simulated, we just got like a ton of people in just a couple of days.

284
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:25,928
So it was obvious that we need to put more energy into Facebook and we need to make it

285
00:19:26,028 --> 00:19:32,410
– it became our main channel of communication because even journalists would follow us.

286
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,531
And sometimes if I write something on Facebook, it'll end up as an article anyway.

287
00:19:38,571 --> 00:19:42,492
So we realized early on that we need to focus on Facebook.

288
00:19:49,484 --> 00:19:54,247
Now how Facebook works, I'm sure like if you work in marketing and stuff like that

289
00:19:54,348 --> 00:19:59,271
you know how Facebook works but I'm gonna explain it fast anyway. Basically

290
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:03,174
updates are always tested on a small group. If you have a hundred thousand

291
00:20:03,274 --> 00:20:08,118
followers on Facebook and you write something that doesn't get pushed to a

292
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,762
hundred thousand people because you know we all like

293
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:16,123
150 different Facebook pages.

294
00:20:16,564 --> 00:20:17,944
If all of them would update every day,

295
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:21,145
we wouldn't be able to see anything else.

296
00:20:21,506 --> 00:20:22,706
Facebook would be full of ads.

297
00:20:23,146 --> 00:20:24,487
So basically what they wanna do,

298
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:26,488
what Facebook wants you to do,

299
00:20:26,948 --> 00:20:29,149
is to filter out all the bad updates

300
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:30,730
and push out all the good ones.

301
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,510
So what they do is they try,

302
00:20:33,211 --> 00:20:34,911
they test an update on a small group,

303
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:35,732
like 100 or 1,000 people.

304
00:20:37,573 --> 00:20:45,720
If the update has good engagement, like likes, shares, comments, then it's pushed out to a slightly larger group.

305
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,622
If it still works, then it's pushed out to a larger group again.

306
00:20:50,364 --> 00:20:53,726
So it's strictly controlled by Facebook, which is a good thing.

307
00:20:55,328 --> 00:21:02,074
Reddit is basically a really, really big Facebook page where everyone updates everything.

308
00:21:02,654 --> 00:21:05,316
And you can control what goes up there.

309
00:21:06,597 --> 00:21:10,821
but it still follows the same kind of idea,

310
00:21:11,421 --> 00:21:14,023
where you let the users and the interests

311
00:21:14,063 --> 00:21:16,045
that the users have in what you write,

312
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:22,049
you let that control how many more people see it.

313
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:23,811
Because on the front page of Reddit

314
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:28,474
are only the updates that have had the most upvotes,

315
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,576
most engagement, and stuff like that.

316
00:21:33,445 --> 00:21:41,090
So, that's how the system works, but usually marketing people stop there, they never look

317
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,271
at how people work.

318
00:21:43,311 --> 00:21:44,432
That's half the equation too.

319
00:21:45,293 --> 00:21:47,574
We like to share things on Facebook to impress our friends.

320
00:21:48,095 --> 00:21:54,559
We all want to be that funny person that has the best cat videos or the most interesting

321
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:56,280
articles about whatever it is.

322
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:07,283
And that's why cats are more viral than anything else, because you'd just rather share a cute picture of a cat than patch notes to a game.

323
00:22:09,564 --> 00:22:19,266
If you play Call of Duty, and Call of Duty releases a new gun, and you have 300 friends on Facebook, maybe two of them play Call of Duty.

324
00:22:19,486 --> 00:22:21,226
So that's only relevant to two of your friends.

325
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:24,167
And you're going to look like a nerd to the rest of them.

326
00:22:24,227 --> 00:22:25,328
And your grandma's going to be like,

327
00:22:25,368 --> 00:22:29,489
why is Armin sharing pictures of guns?

328
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:30,769
What's he going to do?

329
00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:36,931
So that's why things that everyone can appreciate

330
00:22:37,091 --> 00:22:39,891
are always much, much more viral than things

331
00:22:39,951 --> 00:22:42,692
that only a small amount of people can appreciate.

332
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:49,495
So if you're going to run a Facebook page, you can't just think of your fans, but you need to think of the friends of your fans,

333
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:54,617
you need to think, you know, are my fans going to look like idiots if they share this update?

334
00:22:55,277 --> 00:23:03,121
Especially when it comes to things like, here's a concept art for a game, can everyone like and share it please?

335
00:23:05,303 --> 00:23:09,767
That gives no incentive to people to actually like and share it.

336
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:17,374
And it just looks like you're trying too hard to make people market your game, and you're

337
00:23:17,534 --> 00:23:25,582
kind of trying to turn your followers into marketers, and people don't appreciate that.

338
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:37,403
So I've been doing our Facebook updates for two years now and I'm going to do some comparisons

339
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:44,026
in what were our best posts and what were our worst posts and what can we learn from

340
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:44,206
that.

341
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:50,489
We worked with a company that made shirts for us.

342
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,432
Because people were like, oh where can I buy a Goat Simulator shirt?

343
00:23:55,413 --> 00:24:02,300
So we had made some art, we made a couple of mugs and you know small stuff like that.

344
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:06,504
And we thought that it was going to be really big, like people are going to go crazy over

345
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:06,724
this.

346
00:24:07,705 --> 00:24:10,508
But when we updated, when we pushed it to our Facebook.

347
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:13,950
it got very very little people even saw it

348
00:24:14,531 --> 00:24:17,152
and very little people even thought that it was

349
00:24:17,593 --> 00:24:22,876
relevant to engage in. I think back then we had maybe a hundred thousand likes on

350
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:23,317
Facebook

351
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,838
and as you can see it only got out to 15,000 people.

352
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:34,110
I don't know why, I have some theories.

353
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:42,833
It could be because the game is $10, the merch is like $25 plus shipping, so that instantly

354
00:24:43,253 --> 00:24:46,494
removes like 90% of all our players anyway.

355
00:24:47,515 --> 00:24:50,856
It's nothing that you want to share on your Facebook.

356
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:56,358
It's like September 9th, maybe you just started high school, maybe you just started college.

357
00:24:57,859 --> 00:25:01,323
You know, all the cute people in your class are going to go to your Facebook page and

358
00:25:01,363 --> 00:25:03,425
they're going to see some shirt with a goat on it.

359
00:25:04,006 --> 00:25:04,627
It's kind of weird.

360
00:25:05,988 --> 00:25:10,514
So it's nothing, you know, we gain a lot if you share this, but you don't gain anything

361
00:25:10,554 --> 00:25:11,475
from sharing this yourself.

362
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:20,660
We ran a competition, we had a, we added a Steam Workshop to the game, because we wanted

363
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,083
people to make mods and make extra content and we wanted to have a community that was

364
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:25,744
kind of alive.

365
00:25:28,005 --> 00:25:32,969
So we did a competition where we would let players make maps and then we would judge

366
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:35,631
them and the best one would win something cool.

367
00:25:36,971 --> 00:25:43,334
And it was more successful than our shirt campaign, probably because it was free.

368
00:25:46,236 --> 00:25:54,039
But one thing that was, you know, to our detriment was probably that it's not something that everyone can do,

369
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,320
it's not something that everyone wants to do.

370
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,191
It's not something that everyone has time to do even.

371
00:26:00,051 --> 00:26:01,771
So it wasn't, we got like, I think,

372
00:26:02,731 --> 00:26:04,912
we got a dozen or so submissions,

373
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:07,732
but it still took us like,

374
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:11,233
took us some time to play through the maps.

375
00:26:11,873 --> 00:26:16,134
There was like this administration cost to it

376
00:26:16,634 --> 00:26:19,695
where we had to, still had to do some things

377
00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:20,935
for this to work.

378
00:26:22,676 --> 00:26:27,701
And in the end it was good, but we didn't get that much results that we hoped.

379
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:31,905
We had people who were like, oh, everyone's going to start making Goat Simulator Maxx now.

380
00:26:32,745 --> 00:26:34,567
But it wasn't really how it worked.

381
00:26:38,124 --> 00:26:41,085
this picture got 90,000 views and like 330 shares.

382
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:46,108
This was right when NVIDIA released their new graphics card

383
00:26:47,268 --> 00:26:49,509
and they're actually goat towers.

384
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:51,130
Like this is actually a thing.

385
00:26:52,051 --> 00:26:54,992
Sometime around like the 1700s, 1800s in Ireland,

386
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:57,574
they had a ton of goats apparently

387
00:26:58,694 --> 00:27:00,995
and I guess they thought that the goats,

388
00:27:01,696 --> 00:27:03,457
they wanted to do something that looked good.

389
00:27:03,757 --> 00:27:06,458
So they built towers and let goats climb up in them.

390
00:27:07,479 --> 00:27:11,203
as a decoration basically for rich people in the United Kingdom.

391
00:27:12,205 --> 00:27:14,467
So I found this picture, I think someone sent me this picture

392
00:27:15,709 --> 00:27:18,792
and I just put it up on our Facebook page and people thought it was really funny.

393
00:27:19,373 --> 00:27:22,296
We got like 6,000 likes compared to

394
00:27:22,857 --> 00:27:25,600
what was the other like couple hundred likes.

395
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:31,231
We got a ton of shares and you know if you click the share button you see what people wrote when they shared it

396
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,396
And everyone was like ha ha ha look at this

397
00:27:34,258 --> 00:27:37,024
You know they wanted to show this to their friends because it was pretty funny

398
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,056
This is our worst update ever.

399
00:27:41,857 --> 00:27:44,099
Patch notes for the mobile version of the game.

400
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,125
Terrible, probably because only a fraction of our users play mobile.

401
00:27:49,365 --> 00:27:55,191
We have the game on Steam, on Xbox, on Playstation.

402
00:27:55,652 --> 00:27:59,196
So it's only interesting for a small part of our players anyway.

403
00:28:00,437 --> 00:28:02,680
And there's nothing you can say.

404
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,222
You can be like, oh yay.

405
00:28:05,303 --> 00:28:08,688
Maybe you pull out your mobile and download it.

406
00:28:09,349 --> 00:28:10,310
But there's nothing really,

407
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,653
why would I want to share this on my Facebook page?

408
00:28:15,556 --> 00:28:16,117
This got like.

409
00:28:19,191 --> 00:28:19,812
145,000 people reached.

410
00:28:21,013 --> 00:28:24,095
It's two letters, two letter updates, one picture.

411
00:28:24,115 --> 00:28:26,357
I was playing as, there's a,

412
00:28:27,197 --> 00:28:29,419
I think this is called Giant Goat,

413
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,561
or like Fish Goat or something like that.

414
00:28:33,142 --> 00:28:33,822
It's a blue whale.

415
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:35,023
You can't even control it.

416
00:28:35,103 --> 00:28:36,424
You can just like roll around

417
00:28:36,444 --> 00:28:37,485
because you don't have any legs.

418
00:28:38,186 --> 00:28:43,191
And I got stuck like in a... I was gonna jump into the pool, but I got stuck right next to there

419
00:28:43,211 --> 00:28:46,836
And I thought it was a funny picture, so I took it. I put it up on our Facebook page

420
00:28:47,697 --> 00:28:52,182
And you know people thought it was really funny, and they shared it, and I think it got up on reddit as well

421
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,163
This is our most viral Facebook post ever that we've ever done.

422
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,325
There's not even any text. It's just a picture.

423
00:29:00,545 --> 00:29:03,207
I didn't even make this picture.

424
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:05,329
I found it on Google or something.

425
00:29:07,991 --> 00:29:08,612
9000 shares.

426
00:29:10,033 --> 00:29:13,756
If you're going to buy advertisements on Facebook on.

427
00:29:14,957 --> 00:29:20,841
pop-up ads, whatever you're going to do, half a million reach is pretty expensive, right?

428
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:24,324
It's like you end up paying like a couple of hundred or a couple of thousand dollars

429
00:29:24,364 --> 00:29:28,046
for it if you're going to do like a campaign to push your game to that many people.

430
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:30,328
This was like two minutes of work.

431
00:29:30,448 --> 00:29:35,472
This was like literally, haha, that's funny, drag and drop to desktop, drag and drop to

432
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:37,693
Facebook, update.

433
00:29:38,294 --> 00:29:40,455
And because it's a funny thing to share, right?

434
00:29:42,437 --> 00:29:44,238
So that was really successful for us.

435
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:57,132
So basically what I learned from Facebook is that, and this applies, like I told you, this applies to Reddit, this applies to really any social media out there, and social media is growing like crazy.

436
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,642
People don't share or comment on things that make them look stupid.

437
00:30:01,942 --> 00:30:07,684
There's no reason you want to share patch notes to a game about goats on your Facebook page.

438
00:30:08,124 --> 00:30:09,645
What do your friends have to gain from that?

439
00:30:11,046 --> 00:30:14,267
I think it's important as a marketing person to use your common sense,

440
00:30:14,327 --> 00:30:19,249
to not stare yourself blind on the numbers and try to impress your bosses too much.

441
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,751
People want to share funny things. People don't want to share commercials.

442
00:30:24,272 --> 00:30:27,674
Other updates that are really terrible are when our game is on a sale.

443
00:30:28,074 --> 00:30:30,856
Like, Go Team Leader is on a 75% off sale.

444
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:33,438
No one clicks on that.

445
00:30:35,539 --> 00:30:38,141
You might tab out and go on Steam and buy the game,

446
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:40,522
but you're never going to share that to your friends.

447
00:30:44,236 --> 00:30:46,958
People don't like being, you know, walking commercials.

448
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:51,981
So I think it's really important to entertain your people,

449
00:30:52,982 --> 00:30:54,242
you know, create an environment

450
00:30:54,262 --> 00:30:55,343
that people want to be part of.

451
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:59,326
You know how Apple has, what are they called, Apple bars?

452
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:06,552
You know the Apple things where you go with your computer and they're always like so nice.

453
00:31:06,612 --> 00:31:09,953
Their customer service is basically like a party, right?

454
00:31:10,093 --> 00:31:14,035
Like Apple stores are like a party and they make it a party that you want to go to.

455
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:19,036
And that's something that you should think about when you make social media as well.

456
00:31:19,416 --> 00:31:25,038
Make your website or Facebook page or whatever it is, make it a cool party that people want

457
00:31:25,058 --> 00:31:30,280
to visit instead of forcing people to share things for you.

458
00:31:32,966 --> 00:31:37,409
This is my saddest slide. How is media today? I think media today is really terrible

459
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:42,273
It hasn't really changed since mass marketing was invented a hundred years ago

460
00:31:43,293 --> 00:31:49,518
It's still built on obsolete technology. I don't know how often I get emails that are like, you know, do you want to buy?

461
00:31:49,538 --> 00:31:53,441
ad space on a building in a

462
00:31:53,921 --> 00:32:00,365
City somewhere in the US and we're you know, we're situated in Sweden anyway, or like do you want to buy ads on a train?

463
00:32:01,806 --> 00:32:04,408
and it's not really, you know, it's not really

464
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:07,330
something that our customers are going to see anyway.

465
00:32:08,191 --> 00:32:09,011
Basically, you know,

466
00:32:09,772 --> 00:32:11,733
a lot of people that are on trains are going to see it,

467
00:32:11,853 --> 00:32:12,954
but it's not something that

468
00:32:14,055 --> 00:32:15,296
is relevant for us at all.

469
00:32:16,696 --> 00:32:18,658
What developers do is that they use

470
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,460
pre-written responses everywhere.

471
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,361
You know, you write something to a Facebook page

472
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:24,602
and they're like...

473
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:28,265
Thank you for your feedback, Jack.

474
00:32:28,465 --> 00:32:30,149
We will take it into consideration.

475
00:32:30,489 --> 00:32:32,033
We're really glad that you like our game.

476
00:32:32,714 --> 00:32:34,298
And that's, you know, if you're gonna write that,

477
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:36,282
you might as well not answer at all.

478
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:45,797
And developers either put PR professionals between themselves and the players

479
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:49,680
That's usually what the large companies do, the companies that have the money

480
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:58,849
The companies that don't have the money, like indie developers, they just ignore their fans completely because they're so scared of, you know

481
00:32:59,249 --> 00:33:04,194
I'm gonna say something stupid, people are gonna hate me, or they just don't know what to answer at all

482
00:33:06,656 --> 00:33:12,619
I had, when we made the MMO expansion, we were looking for suggestions from our fans.

483
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,342
So I wrote this update, you know, what would you want to do, what would you want us to

484
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:18,803
update Goat Simulator with?

485
00:33:19,683 --> 00:33:21,785
And the responses that we got were terrible.

486
00:33:22,025 --> 00:33:23,285
It's like, you can't use them.

487
00:33:24,146 --> 00:33:25,827
Lasers, what am I going to do with lasers?

488
00:33:25,947 --> 00:33:27,888
Or like, squirrel diving suits?

489
00:33:28,128 --> 00:33:29,469
How can that be an expansion even?

490
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,933
So I just started making fun of the suggestions.

491
00:33:34,313 --> 00:33:38,157
It was a Monday, I was sitting down with my coffee,

492
00:33:38,637 --> 00:33:40,819
and I was like, holy shit, people are stupid.

493
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:44,002
Someone's gonna quote me on that.

494
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:44,783
Fuck.

495
00:33:45,864 --> 00:33:49,407
Anyway, I was just chatting with them,

496
00:33:49,848 --> 00:33:53,071
not making fun of them that much, a little bit,

497
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:55,953
but playing around, being playful.

498
00:33:57,835 --> 00:34:00,978
And I noticed that we got so many, so much more engagement.

499
00:34:01,418 --> 00:34:06,343
Like, you know, I would get more likes on my comments

500
00:34:06,403 --> 00:34:09,246
than on the actual, you know, thing that I updated.

501
00:34:09,987 --> 00:34:13,650
And people started like, you know, tagging their friends.

502
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,312
They're like, oh, look what they're doing.

503
00:34:15,352 --> 00:34:18,074
Like, you know, their Facebook page guy is drunk.

504
00:34:19,855 --> 00:34:23,976
And, you know, it kind of became a thing, which was really fun.

505
00:34:23,996 --> 00:34:26,237
This was like also one of our most viral posts.

506
00:34:27,437 --> 00:34:31,098
I don't know how much this is worth, how many hundreds of dollars in marketing this is worth,

507
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,479
but it was really, really successful for us.

508
00:34:35,279 --> 00:34:38,140
So when you do something that works, you want to keep doing it, right?

509
00:34:39,281 --> 00:34:39,441
So...

510
00:34:40,741 --> 00:34:45,663
I noticed, you know, casual interaction really increases engagement so much with people.

511
00:34:46,324 --> 00:34:50,285
They see you replying and they want to comment as well, of course.

512
00:34:51,366 --> 00:34:55,908
You know, someone writes something stupid, I reply with something stupid,

513
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:59,570
so people are like, oh, can I, I'm going to say something even more crazy.

514
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,132
And I think basically, you know, interacting with your community

515
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:07,913
is so much better than trying to manage them in some way.

516
00:35:09,771 --> 00:35:12,953
I think there's basically three types of comments.

517
00:35:13,773 --> 00:35:17,756
There are comments that aren't very useful, like the ones that you guys just saw.

518
00:35:18,856 --> 00:35:22,759
There are toxic comments, you know, people that want to kill you because you've made

519
00:35:22,799 --> 00:35:28,822
a freaking gay man, and actually useful suggestions, but those are really rare though.

520
00:35:29,903 --> 00:35:36,527
So during Sanctum 2, I did the thing that I just said that you shouldn't do, which is

521
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:37,127
ignore.

522
00:35:39,362 --> 00:35:41,223
every single comment that wasn't,

523
00:35:41,864 --> 00:35:43,265
I love Sanctum too, I can't wait.

524
00:35:43,385 --> 00:35:46,268
And then I just reply, thanks, or smiley, you know.

525
00:35:46,288 --> 00:35:48,890
I would play it really safe

526
00:35:48,951 --> 00:35:50,592
because I was really new at marketing

527
00:35:50,632 --> 00:35:53,615
and I was like, I don't wanna start a Twitter storm.

528
00:35:53,635 --> 00:35:56,477
I don't want people to, you know, get mad at me.

529
00:35:59,642 --> 00:36:04,826
But in gold simulator, I basically interact with them as I would in interact with them in real life

530
00:36:05,267 --> 00:36:09,450
So if you would walk up to me and you should you say that I should give away my work for free

531
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:12,373
This is exactly how I would reply to your comment

532
00:36:13,894 --> 00:36:15,095
and I really

533
00:36:15,755 --> 00:36:16,916
you know initially I was like

534
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:23,347
I replied and then I checked back in like two minutes and I'm like, you know, has something

535
00:36:23,387 --> 00:36:23,887
bad happened?

536
00:36:23,967 --> 00:36:25,068
Has it exploded?

537
00:36:25,428 --> 00:36:25,768
It didn't.

538
00:36:25,988 --> 00:36:29,530
And then, you know, we just end up getting more and more likes and people would just

539
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:29,830
laugh.

540
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:34,512
And, you know, even, of course I'm not, I mean, I'm writing in caps lock.

541
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:35,493
Of course I'm not angry.

542
00:36:35,733 --> 00:36:40,175
We were just playing around and, you know, people would find it funny and even the people

543
00:36:40,215 --> 00:36:44,717
that I would kind of make fun of would just, you know, be really in on it and they would

544
00:36:44,737 --> 00:36:45,338
think that it's funny.

545
00:36:47,979 --> 00:36:52,300
I decided that I'm going to reply to every single comment, even if it's totally pointless.

546
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,100
If you write something pointless, maybe you just want someone to answer.

547
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:59,361
Maybe you just want to be seen for a while, like David.

548
00:37:00,041 --> 00:37:06,223
He just needs a hug, you know, and a relaxing cup of hot chocolate.

549
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:12,644
So dealing with toxicity, that's the hardest part, of course.

550
00:37:12,684 --> 00:37:14,305
It's easy to make fun of people that are, you know...

551
00:37:17,566 --> 00:37:19,729
happy and making fun of themselves a little bit.

552
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,513
With Sanctum 2 we just ignored it.

553
00:37:23,194 --> 00:37:29,663
We had like, once one of our programmers was like, wrote something.

554
00:37:29,683 --> 00:37:30,804
It was like...

555
00:37:33,963 --> 00:37:36,925
I don't remember what it was, but he just wrote a comment and people were like,

556
00:37:38,546 --> 00:37:42,329
you know, if you reply to toxic comment, you just get like a hundred toxic comments

557
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:46,453
back, people just like there's no shortage of angry people on the Internet.

558
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:50,516
And as soon as you reply, you just attract them, you know, even more.

559
00:37:51,376 --> 00:37:53,598
So we would just like ignore every single toxic comment.

560
00:37:53,618 --> 00:37:55,820
But we would still be kind of afraid because we were like,

561
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,122
what if I delete this comment that tells me that I should go kill myself?

562
00:37:59,483 --> 00:38:01,084
Is that censorship?

563
00:38:01,764 --> 00:38:02,705
Are people going to get mad?

564
00:38:02,965 --> 00:38:07,928
Are we going to get raided by even more goons that come over here and harass us even more?

565
00:38:08,489 --> 00:38:11,991
So you were like, kind of, you know, you were really scared.

566
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:15,534
You weren't really, didn't really know how you were going to handle it.

567
00:38:16,314 --> 00:38:20,937
But Goat Simulator is, you can talk shit back as much as you want, as long as you're funny

568
00:38:20,977 --> 00:38:21,237
doing it.

569
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,659
Because I think there's a really big difference between a...

570
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:30,061
you know, when someone attacks you and you wrestle them down to the ground and roll around in the mud like an idiot,

571
00:38:31,182 --> 00:38:36,023
and when, you know, someone attacks you and you just deflect and make fun of them.

572
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:40,985
So, you know, the way you answer is really, really important.

573
00:38:41,765 --> 00:38:43,526
Especially, you know, as long as you're funny.

574
00:38:43,806 --> 00:38:50,108
And you don't even have to meet their criticism if their criticism is really angry and, you know, really toxic.

575
00:38:52,589 --> 00:38:58,051
Here's a bunch of toxic comments. Basically, you know, if you're going to come to my Facebook

576
00:38:58,071 --> 00:39:02,734
page and talk shit, then you, you know, if you deal it, you've got to be able to take

577
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:08,656
it yourself. You know, Jeffrey comes to my page, talks shit about my mom, I'm going to

578
00:39:08,676 --> 00:39:18,341
get him back. The Steven guy to the top right, this update that provoked Steven so much was

579
00:39:18,421 --> 00:39:19,762
that we had ported the game to Mac.

580
00:39:20,502 --> 00:39:23,124
and we were like, okay, Goat Simulator is on Mac now,

581
00:39:23,425 --> 00:39:25,186
you can play it on Mac, and Steven is like,

582
00:39:25,286 --> 00:39:27,868
oh my God, I'm so angry, how can you do this?

583
00:39:28,529 --> 00:39:29,550
They don't deserve this game.

584
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,492
And you're like, if you just burst their bubble,

585
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:34,814
then they realize that they're being idiots, right?

586
00:39:34,854 --> 00:39:37,937
Because some of them, we've all been 12, right?

587
00:39:38,317 --> 00:39:41,499
I remember when I played Warcraft III on a,

588
00:39:42,918 --> 00:39:49,524
my old computer and you beat someone you're like haha you suck and basically

589
00:39:49,584 --> 00:39:53,668
if you act like that you just need someone to you know sit you down and be

590
00:39:53,708 --> 00:39:58,192
like okay is this is this really worth getting angry over this really something

591
00:39:58,212 --> 00:40:00,274
you should be upset over you know

592
00:40:02,871 --> 00:40:04,451
And when I wrote this, it was...

593
00:40:05,592 --> 00:40:11,433
These were like some of our biggest updates as well.

594
00:40:11,753 --> 00:40:15,274
Like, if one person is toxic to you, and you make fun of them,

595
00:40:15,574 --> 00:40:17,454
you're gonna get like 10 people that agree with you,

596
00:40:17,774 --> 00:40:19,355
that are gonna start making fun of them too.

597
00:40:19,475 --> 00:40:23,236
Like, people would like write comments under it and be like,

598
00:40:23,356 --> 00:40:25,396
oh, you got burned, man, you know.

599
00:40:26,156 --> 00:40:29,417
So, you're allowed to talk shit as long as you're funny.

600
00:40:31,111 --> 00:40:39,719
There's, you know, this update was really unnecessary and I replied and, you know, someone

601
00:40:39,739 --> 00:40:44,884
put it up on Reddit and as you can see under there, 541,000 views.

602
00:40:45,405 --> 00:40:48,247
That's also hundreds or thousands of money in marketing.

603
00:40:48,748 --> 00:40:51,230
Just, you know, Ethan really helped us out, you know.

604
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:00,406
just by you know commenting back to people, replying when people thought

605
00:41:00,426 --> 00:41:03,949
there's no way he thought that we were going to reply to that and then we did

606
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:07,673
and people thought that was really funny and you know it saves you a lot of

607
00:41:07,713 --> 00:41:08,314
marketing costs

608
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:13,758
This is all the top posts about Goat Simulator.

609
00:41:13,898 --> 00:41:17,461
Usually it takes around, when we released Goat Simulator,

610
00:41:17,521 --> 00:41:20,283
it took around three to four thousand upvotes

611
00:41:20,343 --> 00:41:22,124
to get featured on the front page.

612
00:41:22,204 --> 00:41:24,326
Now it's more like five or six thousand

613
00:41:24,346 --> 00:41:25,727
because Reddit has really grown a lot.

614
00:41:26,687 --> 00:41:29,069
But this is totally free marketing.

615
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:32,792
I said that I was gonna talk more about Reddit.

616
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,135
I myself never update anything on Reddit.

617
00:41:40,127 --> 00:41:41,728
Because I think Reddit is kind of like a...

618
00:41:42,628 --> 00:41:43,728
It's its own community.

619
00:41:44,048 --> 00:41:47,529
They have, you know, their own type of talking.

620
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:49,009
They have their own memes and stuff like that.

621
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:50,690
It's kind of like going to a party

622
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:53,410
and selling steak knives, you know?

623
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,871
You know, those things.

624
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,551
And people are enjoying themselves

625
00:41:56,591 --> 00:41:58,371
and you're like, why don't you buy these things?

626
00:41:58,451 --> 00:42:00,172
Why don't you buy my things?

627
00:42:00,632 --> 00:42:03,133
And everyone's just gonna get angry at you.

628
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:05,393
And everyone's gonna know that you're that developer

629
00:42:05,713 --> 00:42:07,274
that keeps coming to Reddit Gaming

630
00:42:07,574 --> 00:42:09,154
and keeps pushing your stupid game on us.

631
00:42:09,914 --> 00:42:17,018
So I think this is also a thing where you should just try to make fun content, and if

632
00:42:17,058 --> 00:42:18,919
you do that, then people will find it.

633
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:21,620
Reddit, as you know, they have eyes everywhere.

634
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,022
If you do something funny, they're going to find it, they're going to put it up on Reddit,

635
00:42:25,482 --> 00:42:27,483
and if it's funny enough, it's going to get upvoted.

636
00:42:27,844 --> 00:42:34,447
There's no reason that you should, as a developer, try to do commercial for your company on Reddit.

637
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:42,795
Last notes and tips. We're going to do questions. I intentionally saved 15 minutes so that we can do,

638
00:42:44,276 --> 00:42:48,360
you guys can ask and we can discuss things. So I hope you thought about questions so far.

639
00:42:49,821 --> 00:42:55,286
But first I'm going to go through the last tips. If you're going to go away with something in this

640
00:42:55,366 --> 00:43:01,011
talk, then I would say that you should remember to, when you do marketing, produce content that

641
00:43:01,071 --> 00:43:04,334
people want to share. Don't just produce content that people

642
00:43:05,195 --> 00:43:10,347
that you earn something from. Make things that your fans earn something from sharing it as well.

643
00:43:11,693 --> 00:43:21,937
Create a cool party on the internet that people want to go to, instead of creating a huge billboard of, you know, marketing and screenshots of your game.

644
00:43:23,238 --> 00:43:27,920
And I think it's really important to stand out in every single way that you possibly can.

645
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:35,463
Now again, I know that everyone isn't making a game about goats, so it doesn't always have to be stand out in a funny way.

646
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:39,041
Although I think games could be way more funny than they are.

647
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:41,983
I think people are way too serious in the games industry.

648
00:43:42,864 --> 00:43:46,687
But basically doing something that people don't expect is always going to get you more

649
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,109
attention than doing what everyone else is doing.

650
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:53,212
Because if you have a crowd of people, like if you have a hundred marketing people, everyone's

651
00:43:53,253 --> 00:43:56,856
like banging cans and pots and yelling about their game.

652
00:43:57,336 --> 00:44:02,480
If you just, you know, wear a pink suit and stand there, then everyone's eyes are going

653
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,061
to get drawn to you.

654
00:44:05,197 --> 00:44:10,642
Yes, questions please. We have microphones over there, line up and let's do questions.

655
00:44:12,203 --> 00:44:17,108
Hi, I'm making a game about mice, so that's kind of similar. We have a

656
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:22,272
Facebook page that has 1.6 million likes. Holy, how did you get that much?

657
00:44:23,411 --> 00:44:24,332
The game is six years old.

658
00:44:24,352 --> 00:44:27,314
Did you buy them?

659
00:44:27,674 --> 00:44:27,754
No.

660
00:44:27,855 --> 00:44:30,457
But we have a problem with our Facebook page.

661
00:44:30,657 --> 00:44:34,160
It's that it's very scattered between many, many languages.

662
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:40,405
And I see all your updates are in English, but when we post something on Facebook, we

663
00:44:40,465 --> 00:44:46,650
have like 200 comments that are in 20 different languages, and it's really hard to reply to

664
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:48,011
them all in a witty way.

665
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:49,372
So how do you manage that?

666
00:44:50,283 --> 00:44:51,203
We just don't do that.

667
00:44:51,404 --> 00:44:52,444
Yeah.

668
00:44:52,644 --> 00:44:55,306
You don't have any comments in other languages than English?

669
00:44:56,246 --> 00:44:56,387
No.

670
00:44:56,767 --> 00:44:57,988
I've actually, it doesn't happen.

671
00:44:58,268 --> 00:45:01,530
I guess that Goat Simulator kind of became big with YouTubers.

672
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,732
And there's a lot of YouTube fans that come on our page.

673
00:45:06,773 --> 00:45:11,295
And I don't have a good response to that question.

674
00:45:11,335 --> 00:45:11,736
I'm sorry.

675
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:13,617
You could.

676
00:45:15,715 --> 00:45:18,576
you could do things that aren't text, maybe?

677
00:45:18,736 --> 00:45:21,957
Like do more screenshots instead of language updates?

678
00:45:22,237 --> 00:45:23,377
Yeah, that's exactly what we do.

679
00:45:23,397 --> 00:45:26,698
We always post an image with no text on it

680
00:45:26,738 --> 00:45:28,779
that just explains what we want to do.

681
00:45:29,279 --> 00:45:32,240
But Facebook recently released a feature

682
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:36,101
that lets you post one post in two different languages.

683
00:45:36,561 --> 00:45:39,902
And it's really recently, like two weeks ago.

684
00:45:40,262 --> 00:45:44,123
But we used to make one status for every language before.

685
00:45:44,584 --> 00:45:46,805
and that reached really poorly.

686
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:47,645
So much work, though.

687
00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:48,606
Yeah.

688
00:45:48,826 --> 00:45:49,666
It's so much work.

689
00:45:49,766 --> 00:45:51,847
And it scatters the comments a lot,

690
00:45:51,927 --> 00:45:54,709
so people don't see the post.

691
00:45:54,749 --> 00:45:57,710
It doesn't have many comments, so they don't engage with it.

692
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:00,652
So it's kind of hard.

693
00:46:01,332 --> 00:46:02,253
Try Google Translate.

694
00:46:02,633 --> 00:46:04,014
Even if it doesn't make any sense,

695
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:08,856
even if you sound like an idiot, it's not a big deal, I think.

696
00:46:10,177 --> 00:46:10,617
OK, thanks.

697
00:46:11,217 --> 00:46:11,638
Thank you.

698
00:46:11,858 --> 00:46:12,998
I'm sorry I couldn't answer it better.

699
00:46:16,444 --> 00:46:24,631
Oh, hi. Hello. Nice talk. You mentioned that Facebook was your main, like, venue to get

700
00:46:24,671 --> 00:46:30,856
to the fans. How do you feel about, like, the website? Do you have to have the website

701
00:46:30,896 --> 00:46:32,037
just the basic stuff?

702
00:46:32,878 --> 00:46:39,463
Because a lot of developers try to update the website, then update the Facebook post, then Twitter and stuff.

703
00:46:39,483 --> 00:46:45,708
It's just so much work. So how do you feel about the games website or just the studio website?

704
00:46:46,408 --> 00:46:51,589
I'll say I think our studio website is more for people that want to apply to work with us.

705
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:56,990
They want to know more about Coffee Stain as a studio.

706
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:02,371
I think it's so much easier for people to go on Facebook because everyone is on Facebook

707
00:47:02,451 --> 00:47:07,032
and it's just, you know, you always have a Facebook tab in your phone up.

708
00:47:07,052 --> 00:47:11,753
It's so much easier to subscribe to information on Facebook than be like, you know...

709
00:47:13,114 --> 00:47:19,019
Take out your calendar and write like every Saturday remember to check their website for new information

710
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,982
so I basically think you I think you just scatter your

711
00:47:23,723 --> 00:47:29,028
fans if you have them on two different places and you suggest to just put in like a link to your

712
00:47:29,648 --> 00:47:34,152
Facebook page on your website, and then just if you want to post or info just go to Facebook

713
00:47:34,444 --> 00:47:41,427
Yeah, and do one of those things where you get a small screenshot of the latest update

714
00:47:41,447 --> 00:47:46,529
that you had on Facebook on your website so that people can get an update without you

715
00:47:46,569 --> 00:47:50,210
having to update two things every time you do something.

716
00:47:54,090 --> 00:48:20,028
Thanks for the talk. It was really good. I really like the voice that you have, you know, when you're interacting with your fans on the Goat Simulator page, and I wonder if, you know, when you guys come out with your next game that's not, I mean, it fits really perfectly with the Goat Simulator brand, and if you come out with, like, Sanctum 3 or something that's, like, more serious, how would you adjust that voice on the Facebook page for Sanctum 3 as opposed, how would you apply these lessons to something that's more serious?

717
00:48:20,088 --> 00:48:24,709
That's a really good question. If you look at, I saw, you know, Civilization Beyond Earth,

718
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:31,651
and they have, it's a sci-fi game, and of course they have a ton of sci-fi fans on their page.

719
00:48:32,251 --> 00:48:36,713
So they update things like articles, like you know when they found like gravitational waves?

720
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:43,777
they put it up on Sid Meier's Civilization Beyond Earth and they got like so many shares from that

721
00:48:43,997 --> 00:48:48,480
because their fans are really interested in space stuff, right, because you play a space game.

722
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,842
So I think you can definitely, you know, it doesn't only have to be funny things,

723
00:48:54,603 --> 00:48:58,346
you can do like they're doing it. If you have a game that's about being an...

724
00:48:59,166 --> 00:49:03,754
Cowboy, write like a cowboy, you know, write like an astronaut or something like that.

725
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:10,266
You know, make it something different than just, you know, thanks for playing our game. Please, you know, tell all your friends.

726
00:49:10,286 --> 00:49:11,588
Thanks

727
00:49:14,567 --> 00:49:15,728
Hi, thank you very much for the talk.

728
00:49:15,748 --> 00:49:16,288
It was really good.

729
00:49:16,308 --> 00:49:18,789
I thought you did a great job branding GoatSim.

730
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:21,731
My question is, you talked a little bit about Reddit.

731
00:49:22,371 --> 00:49:25,652
And obviously, I think it's really good advice not to use

732
00:49:25,692 --> 00:49:26,673
it as a commercial tool.

733
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:29,854
But in terms of an engagement tool, how often do you

734
00:49:29,914 --> 00:49:31,875
interact with fans on Reddit?

735
00:49:32,656 --> 00:49:38,258
And one other thing you mentioned, something that I

736
00:49:38,298 --> 00:49:41,820
work on in my role, is getting devs to talk to players.

737
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,861
What have you done to kind of?

738
00:49:45,448 --> 00:49:49,029
have your devs out there a little bit more and did you have them go to Reddit or just

739
00:49:49,089 --> 00:49:50,910
Facebook or anywhere else?

740
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:57,052
I read all Reddit threads, but I don't reply ever.

741
00:49:57,132 --> 00:50:00,613
I think I did it like the first couple of times, but it's like as soon as you reply

742
00:50:00,633 --> 00:50:03,794
you get like a hundred people who are like, oh I have a suggestion, why don't you make

743
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:04,894
a bird simulator instead?

744
00:50:05,134 --> 00:50:09,776
Why don't you make, you know, my mom really likes dogs, can't you make a game that has

745
00:50:09,916 --> 00:50:11,456
like her dog that looks like her dog?

746
00:50:11,536 --> 00:50:12,337
She'll be really happy.

747
00:50:12,637 --> 00:50:17,840
You know, you get so much spam and you tell them, oh, you know, can't you guys go to our

748
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,702
Facebook and ask me those things there?

749
00:50:20,022 --> 00:50:22,904
And they're like, stop marketing your Facebook on our page.

750
00:50:23,945 --> 00:50:25,646
So I read all of them.

751
00:50:26,227 --> 00:50:32,111
There's an app that you can get that basically whenever someone writes Goat Simulator anywhere

752
00:50:32,171 --> 00:50:34,613
on the internet and, you know, on a Reddit or whatever.

753
00:50:35,593 --> 00:50:38,294
I get an email with a link to the site.

754
00:50:38,414 --> 00:50:41,155
So every time there's a Reddit thread about Goat Simulator,

755
00:50:41,415 --> 00:50:45,777
I see it, I read through it, but I don't comment on it.

756
00:50:45,957 --> 00:50:48,698
If they want to talk with me, go to our Facebook page.

757
00:50:51,693 --> 00:50:58,398
Thank you very much. This is a really good talk. We're localizing a game that's kind of like a very off-the-wall style.

758
00:50:58,518 --> 00:51:05,004
It's basically a rail shooter meets dating sim called Gal Gun that we're bringing over to the West.

759
00:51:05,164 --> 00:51:05,504
Thank you.

760
00:51:06,044 --> 00:51:09,507
It's got that kind of very ridiculous sort of marketing style to it as well.

761
00:51:10,948 --> 00:51:15,772
You guys have an amazing engagement on your Facebook page, but I'm wondering, do you guys use Twitter very much?

762
00:51:15,932 --> 00:51:17,694
And how do you utilize that avenue as well?

763
00:51:18,594 --> 00:51:25,659
Not that much. We use personal Twitters. So you follow us on Facebook if you want to know about the brand Goat Simulator.

764
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:32,825
But if you want to know more about our employees, then you follow us on our personal Twitter pages.

765
00:51:33,645 --> 00:51:40,250
And on Facebook I maybe update once every other day. On Twitter you can do whatever you want.

766
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:46,182
update every day, post pictures of your food or whatever.

767
00:51:46,202 --> 00:51:47,886
I think Twitter should more be used,

768
00:51:48,047 --> 00:51:49,871
people want to follow people on Twitter

769
00:51:50,252 --> 00:51:51,715
and brands on Facebook, I think.

770
00:51:52,573 --> 00:51:57,335
Okay, so you guys don't utilize Twitter really for goat simulator stuff like you do on Facebook, really?

771
00:51:57,735 --> 00:52:03,457
We have a coffee stain Twitter, where we write, you know, if we release something, we write on coffee stain Twitter.

772
00:52:03,898 --> 00:52:09,259
But I, you know, I update that maybe once or twice a month, when we have something to say, we update it on Twitter.

773
00:52:09,279 --> 00:52:13,661
Because otherwise, there's not much you can do, there's not much you can write on Twitter.

774
00:52:13,721 --> 00:52:19,763
And it's only 144 characters, and most people miss what you tweet anyway,

775
00:52:19,783 --> 00:52:22,124
because there's so much more noise on Twitter than on Facebook.

776
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:23,079
OK, great.

777
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:25,582
Thank you.

778
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:29,307
Do you have a rule of thumb for how often you need to post?

779
00:52:29,687 --> 00:52:31,550
And maybe you don't have this problem,

780
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:34,013
but if you don't have anything interesting to say,

781
00:52:34,113 --> 00:52:35,635
is it best not to say anything?

782
00:52:36,274 --> 00:52:36,994
That's so hard.

783
00:52:37,755 --> 00:52:42,196
It's basically when I have something fun in mind,

784
00:52:42,256 --> 00:52:42,797
I post it.

785
00:52:43,197 --> 00:52:46,138
I try to post every other, every third day.

786
00:52:46,878 --> 00:52:48,079
If we're releasing something new,

787
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:50,439
if we have a bunch of new screenshots

788
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,920
or gifs that we want to show off,

789
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,561
then I could post every day.

790
00:52:54,321 --> 00:52:57,202
But I think there's a risk in being,

791
00:52:57,222 --> 00:53:00,623
saying something just for the sake of saying it.

792
00:53:01,063 --> 00:53:02,904
And I think that kind of just makes you look

793
00:53:03,064 --> 00:53:04,405
a little bit lame and boring.

794
00:53:05,245 --> 00:53:10,610
So, you know, update as often as you can, as long as it's good things.

795
00:53:13,232 --> 00:53:16,995
So, we're making a game called Chicken, and it's not spelt right.

796
00:53:17,155 --> 00:53:22,820
It's kind of weird, and it's like you build creatures with blocks.

797
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:29,326
So, we got picked up with our tech demo by the YouTube community, and like PewDiePieJack played it.

798
00:53:29,826 --> 00:53:35,187
And it happened very organically, and since October we got like 20 million views on all of those Let's Play videos.

799
00:53:35,547 --> 00:53:41,649
But now we're about to release an Early Access, and we're getting, like, very rigid and thinking about this release.

800
00:53:42,149 --> 00:53:48,991
So, do you think we should let our YouTube community pick it up again organically by buying it or reach out to them?

801
00:53:49,011 --> 00:53:53,492
Because I know you said, don't give PewDiePie a key, like, if he could get it, he could get it himself.

802
00:53:53,972 --> 00:53:58,573
So, we're wondering if we should be, like, reaching out, like, nudging, or just let it go.

803
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:03,846
You can definitely, like, there's nothing, you don't lose anything in reaching out.

804
00:54:04,386 --> 00:54:06,547
I said that mostly because there's a lot of people that are like,

805
00:54:07,087 --> 00:54:10,448
oh, you know, I emailed PewDiePie my key but he hasn't replied, I don't know why,

806
00:54:10,548 --> 00:54:13,349
and you know, he gets a hundred people emailing him things every day.

807
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:16,750
And he probably doesn't read the emails himself,

808
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:19,490
it's probably like some agent of his or stuff like that.

809
00:54:19,791 --> 00:54:20,551
So I think, yeah.

810
00:54:21,431 --> 00:54:25,395
try to reach out, try to just let them know that you're still releasing the game.

811
00:54:26,016 --> 00:54:33,783
And the main tip, try to make them put up their video when you've already released your game.

812
00:54:34,123 --> 00:54:36,626
Or like when you're one day ahead of releasing your game.

813
00:54:36,646 --> 00:54:39,288
Because otherwise people are going to see it, but they're going to forget about it.

814
00:54:40,109 --> 00:54:41,450
That's what we had with Goat Simulator.

815
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:44,252
People started making clones on friggin' iOS.

816
00:54:44,372 --> 00:54:49,236
Before our PC version was out, there was like Goat 3D Simulator on iOS.

817
00:54:49,736 --> 00:54:53,859
And they would get so many downloads when PewDiePie made his video.

818
00:54:54,179 --> 00:55:00,784
Because they would look for Goat Simulator on the App Store, and that's what they would have found.

819
00:55:01,145 --> 00:55:04,867
So I think when a video goes out, you get a ton of people looking for your game.

820
00:55:05,228 --> 00:55:07,169
And it's really good if your game is available then.

821
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:11,402
So give them a key of the day, the week of launch, you're saying?

822
00:55:11,522 --> 00:55:12,363
Yeah, something like that.

823
00:55:12,523 --> 00:55:13,183
Cool, thanks a lot.

824
00:55:15,044 --> 00:55:19,047
Hi, just to follow on what they mentioned on Twitter and Facebook,

825
00:55:20,582 --> 00:55:25,885
Do you have like a... you have of course a web... a Facebook page for GoTimulator but

826
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:31,428
for your other games you use like a Facebook page for each of your games or

827
00:55:31,808 --> 00:55:35,410
would be better to just have one for like Coffee Stain and then have a

828
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:39,252
change when you know depending on the game you're launching at the time?

829
00:55:39,986 --> 00:55:47,668
When I started working at Coffee Stain we had a Facebook page for Sanctum, so it's just been natural for us to make a new Facebook page for our new games.

830
00:55:48,108 --> 00:55:57,210
I don't know if that's the right way to go, I hope so, but you know, you can try it and give me an email and tell me what you think is better.

831
00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:03,052
I don't know myself, but I think it's probably not a big deal in the end.

832
00:56:04,612 --> 00:56:09,333
The most important thing is just that you make good updates and then everything else will work out.

833
00:56:09,621 --> 00:56:11,943
Just focusing on the game at the moment, right?

834
00:56:12,283 --> 00:56:12,483
Yeah.

835
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:12,923
Thanks.

836
00:56:14,444 --> 00:56:14,704
Hi there.

837
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:19,268
So a few years ago, the game we're making right now

838
00:56:19,308 --> 00:56:21,529
just sort of went mildly viral.

839
00:56:21,709 --> 00:56:24,071
And originally, we got taken by surprise.

840
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:26,953
And we sort of, it's called Castle Story,

841
00:56:27,073 --> 00:56:28,674
is on early access right now.

842
00:56:28,734 --> 00:56:29,455
Cool, I bought that.

843
00:56:30,181 --> 00:56:32,362
Sweet, thank you.

844
00:56:32,443 --> 00:56:34,884
But we got taken by surprise and we sort of redirected

845
00:56:34,944 --> 00:56:38,266
everybody on our company's Facebook page.

846
00:56:38,507 --> 00:56:42,829
And we got something like 25,000 likes right now, I think.

847
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:47,633
But it just feels like it sort of has a limited scope,

848
00:56:47,733 --> 00:56:52,556
the possibility of growing because it's completely

849
00:56:52,636 --> 00:56:54,097
unrelated to the game itself.

850
00:56:54,837 --> 00:56:57,640
Do you think, like, how do you feel about that?

851
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,723
Like, the fact that, you know, basically,

852
00:57:02,084 --> 00:57:06,949
should we start from scratch and make it like a Castle Story Facebook page and, you know...

853
00:57:07,749 --> 00:57:08,810
How many followers do you have?

854
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:15,087
20,000 I think at the moment, but not on the company page.

855
00:57:15,107 --> 00:57:18,711
It's not on the, like we don't even update the game page.

856
00:57:19,472 --> 00:57:21,615
So, what are your thoughts on that?

857
00:57:23,016 --> 00:57:28,943
It's a hard question. I don't know. I think there's a point in having your...

858
00:57:29,764 --> 00:57:33,127
the name of your game always be showing, because that's what we had with

859
00:57:33,627 --> 00:57:37,270
you know, the share this goat for no reason

860
00:57:37,631 --> 00:57:40,493
and then it would just say goat simulator, share this goat for no reason

861
00:57:40,533 --> 00:57:43,916
and that's really good, that's like half a million people see your brand and that's good

862
00:57:45,557 --> 00:57:49,820
so that's the good thing about having a page just for your game

863
00:57:50,781 --> 00:57:54,925
but the bad thing is that later when you release a new game you split up your community again

864
00:57:56,725 --> 00:57:58,465
Kind of the same answer as the other guy.

865
00:57:58,526 --> 00:57:59,366
I don't know what's best.

866
00:58:00,166 --> 00:58:01,746
Maybe you can find out and then you can tell me.

867
00:58:01,766 --> 00:58:03,027
All right, sure.

868
00:58:03,067 --> 00:58:03,407
Will do.

869
00:58:03,867 --> 00:58:05,547
Thanks.

870
00:58:05,687 --> 00:58:06,808
I think last question,

871
00:58:06,828 --> 00:58:08,668
because otherwise they're gonna get angry at me.

872
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:09,328
I have a short one.

873
00:58:09,348 --> 00:58:11,069
I was just curious what app you use

874
00:58:11,149 --> 00:58:13,429
to find mentions of Goat Simulator?

875
00:58:13,549 --> 00:58:14,129
Promoter app.

876
00:58:14,549 --> 00:58:14,789
Okay.

877
00:58:14,809 --> 00:58:15,990
It's really good.

878
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:18,570
I think it's like $100 a year or something.

879
00:58:18,610 --> 00:58:19,611
It's really cheap, yeah.

880
00:58:21,171 --> 00:58:22,431
All right, thanks a lot for coming, guys.

881
00:58:22,631 --> 00:58:23,251
It's been a lot of fun.
