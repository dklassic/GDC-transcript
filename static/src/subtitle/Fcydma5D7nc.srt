1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,093
All right, everybody, we are going to pick things up again with the one and only Seth

2
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,619
Marinello, who's going to give a talk on Dead Space 3!

3
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:28,351
Hi everybody, so as Corey introduced me already, I'm Seth Marinello, I was a level designer

4
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:31,152
on Dead Space 2 and then most recently Dead Space 3.

5
00:00:32,013 --> 00:00:37,876
And rather than kind of do a full post-mortem on Dead Space 3, I decided to focus on one

6
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:42,358
specific element, which is the cooperative design that we added to this game, so that

7
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:46,921
we can kind of drill down and look at what building this sort of, you know, major new

8
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:52,363
feature meant as a level designer as we step through the different phases of development.

9
00:00:53,144 --> 00:00:58,188
And I've kind of broken this talk down into four distinct areas, and there was definitely

10
00:00:58,328 --> 00:01:02,972
overlap between these, but I've separated it out based on what's the predominant thing

11
00:01:03,032 --> 00:01:05,074
on the design team's mind at any one point.

12
00:01:05,654 --> 00:01:09,137
So at the very beginning, the main thing we were worried about was what's the concept?

13
00:01:09,177 --> 00:01:11,499
We're adding co-op to Dead Space.

14
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:14,822
What does that mean to the Dead Space franchise and the universe, and what do we want it to

15
00:01:15,102 --> 00:01:16,463
feel like as a design team?

16
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:18,845
And then there was this period where it's like,

17
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:21,066
all right, great, we've got an idea of what we want to do,

18
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,188
but there's all these technical problems

19
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:25,889
because we're going from a franchise

20
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:27,430
that was predominantly single player,

21
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,091
an engine that's predominantly single player,

22
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,332
how do we make that work in a multiplayer world?

23
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:34,374
And with those two players that we now have,

24
00:01:34,774 --> 00:01:37,356
how do we adapt our gameplay and make it work

25
00:01:37,476 --> 00:01:39,517
in a way that still feels balanced and tight,

26
00:01:40,077 --> 00:01:41,598
like the single player campaign does

27
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:43,399
when we drop another player in there?

28
00:01:44,447 --> 00:01:52,112
And also now that we have two screens, how do we take that and create something that expands the experience that's possible in the Dead Space universe?

29
00:01:52,252 --> 00:01:57,156
So that we're not just, you know, adding another feature of it's like, alright, yeah, great, your buddy can drop into the game now.

30
00:01:57,316 --> 00:02:03,901
But it's like, we're leveraging it in a way that makes something possible that we couldn't have done before without adding this.

31
00:02:05,224 --> 00:02:09,445
But before we get ahead of ourselves, we're going to kind of start off with phase one, which is the concept.

32
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:15,608
And when we announced that we were adding co-op to Dead Space 3, I think the first thing that popped in pretty much everyone's mind is,

33
00:02:16,148 --> 00:02:18,048
why the hell are you adding co-op, right?

34
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:21,830
But if you actually step through it, I think it makes a certain amount of sense.

35
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,871
In Dead Space 2, we had a multiplayer mode called Outbreak.

36
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:34,179
And it was a 4-on-4 competitive mode that, you know, was a lot of fun and coming out of a legacy of like making multiplayer maps for Quake and things like that.

37
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:37,382
It was fun to make these small maps that you didn't have to do any streaming on.

38
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:42,086
And it was also fun to have a part of the game that we could go and interact directly with the community.

39
00:02:42,586 --> 00:02:46,410
We did, you know, viral suits and we had some people that really got into it.

40
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,592
But ultimately, it didn't really set the world on fire.

41
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:52,002
And at the same time, we have, you know,

42
00:02:52,062 --> 00:02:53,442
all these videos going up on YouTube

43
00:02:53,462 --> 00:02:55,664
where large numbers of people are beating it

44
00:02:55,964 --> 00:02:58,225
on hardcore mode, which is where you only have three saves

45
00:02:58,685 --> 00:03:00,987
and unlocking special weapons and things like that.

46
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,808
And we have a lot of people that are playing the game

47
00:03:02,988 --> 00:03:04,649
over and over again on New Game Plus

48
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:07,190
to sort of explore the full breadth of our weaponry

49
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:09,231
and experiment with all the different things

50
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:10,692
that are possible within the levels.

51
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:12,173
So we're looking at it, it's like, well.

52
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:17,372
You know, the thing that everyone likes about Dead Space are these immersive narrative levels.

53
00:03:17,852 --> 00:03:19,773
And that's the thing that seems like it's the strength of our team.

54
00:03:19,813 --> 00:03:20,734
We're really good at the art.

55
00:03:20,794 --> 00:03:22,375
We're really good at creating atmosphere.

56
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:25,717
And people like playing this content over and over again.

57
00:03:26,217 --> 00:03:29,939
And we added a number of features that would leverage this, things like our weapon crafting

58
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:32,121
mode, which we have a talk about on Friday.

59
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,756
the co-op dungeons and the beta dungeons.

60
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:43,760
But specifically, co-op gave us a way to go through that campaign an additional time

61
00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:48,784
with sort of like a different perspective on everything and make it feel fresh in a different

62
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:54,107
way. So we decided to take the resources out of the competitive multiplayer mode and put those

63
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:57,629
into creating a co-op mode that played more to our core strengths as a team.

64
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,366
And once we decided that this is something

65
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:02,928
that was worthwhile and that we really wanted to pursue,

66
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:04,709
we had to lay out some high-level goals

67
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:06,850
that would dictate sort of all of our future decisions

68
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,590
as a design team.

69
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:12,376
And the first is, we're going to leave single player untouched as much as possible.

70
00:04:12,637 --> 00:04:15,339
And this doesn't mean that we're not going to change anything

71
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:17,420
going from Dead Space 2 to Dead Space 3,

72
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,023
but that there's this core loop and this core feeling that you get as a player,

73
00:04:21,383 --> 00:04:22,744
which as a team we're fans of,

74
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:25,947
and we know that the people that have played the previous two games are fans of,

75
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:27,788
and we want to preserve that as much as possible.

76
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,431
So single player has to be largely untouched.

77
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,261
But at the same time, we want the co-op mode

78
00:04:34,702 --> 00:04:37,163
to feel like it's an extension of the core experience.

79
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,284
It needs to be complete.

80
00:04:38,664 --> 00:04:40,145
If I beat the game in single player,

81
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:42,226
it needs to feel like I beat a complete game.

82
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:44,007
And if I complete the game in co-op,

83
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:45,648
it needs to feel like I've reached

84
00:04:45,688 --> 00:04:46,789
the end of a complete game.

85
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:47,729
There's a full journey.

86
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,511
So it shouldn't feel like this sort of disconnected, separate

87
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,272
bonus mode or something like that.

88
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,402
And once we had these, we went out and looked at,

89
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:57,864
you know, well, is there an existing pattern in the industry?

90
00:04:57,924 --> 00:04:59,685
Is there some other game that we can look to,

91
00:05:00,445 --> 00:05:01,967
to draw kind of directly from?

92
00:05:01,987 --> 00:05:04,448
And, you know, if you're familiar with the history

93
00:05:04,468 --> 00:05:05,609
of the Dead Space franchise, it's like,

94
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:08,191
well, RE4 was a huge influence on the original team,

95
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:10,653
so looking at RE5 is a natural touch point.

96
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:14,336
But they went down with the decision of having a follower,

97
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:16,297
or that would allow you to, you know,

98
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:18,839
script the same thing in single player or co-op.

99
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:20,160
You didn't have to change the story,

100
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,401
you didn't have to change the puzzles,

101
00:05:21,441 --> 00:05:22,301
you just had a follower.

102
00:05:23,054 --> 00:05:26,099
And in a lot of ways that would have been an easy path to go down,

103
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,224
but for us it just didn't seem like it was a fit for the Dead Space franchise,

104
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:33,190
and it would have changed too many things that we wanted to preserve.

105
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:36,635
The other sort of approach to this...

106
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:41,947
I think you can see in games like Halo where you have the ability to play campaign co-op,

107
00:05:42,067 --> 00:05:45,269
but every time you hit a major story moment, it's like, oh well it's actually just the

108
00:05:45,289 --> 00:05:46,129
story of Master Chief.

109
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:48,350
Like this other guy over here, he doesn't really exist.

110
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:53,292
And you know, they experimented in Reach with this a little bit, but ultimately the second

111
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,913
player is just another gun running around the world.

112
00:05:56,614 --> 00:05:59,716
And it's a lot of fun. It's actually my preferred way of going through Halo.

113
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:02,358
But when you're making a game where you need to be immersed in your character

114
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:04,820
and you have this third-person camera and you're looking at someone,

115
00:06:05,161 --> 00:06:07,282
that you're investing in your weapon upgrades and things like that.

116
00:06:07,362 --> 00:06:11,145
I think it's very important that whatever player, Isaac or Carver,

117
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,227
which is the name of our secondary character,

118
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:15,889
that you have some sort of investment and understanding of them

119
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,691
as, you know, an entity within the Dead Space universe.

120
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:27,199
So it was obvious that there wasn't an existing pattern that we could directly apply and meet all the needs that we had for Dead Space 3.

121
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:31,483
So we ended up coming up with these sort of two distinct universes.

122
00:06:32,043 --> 00:06:38,629
One is this the single-player universe where it's the story of Isaac struggling alone on Tau Volantis against Necromorphs,

123
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:41,652
and the NPC interactions are just like they were in Dead Space 2.

124
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:45,456
He's still talking to people on his rig system, getting audio logs and things like that.

125
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:48,326
And at the same time, we have this parallel universe.

126
00:06:49,046 --> 00:06:51,127
And in this one, it's got the same core story,

127
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:55,949
the same plot thread about the markers and this ice planet.

128
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:01,690
But the core character arc is about Isaac and Carver

129
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,191
working together and kind of overcoming their differences

130
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:06,332
to unite against this greater evil.

131
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:10,789
And this required us creating a sort of flexible narrative that could go one way or the other.

132
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:14,992
And this was basically in a lot of ways an impossible challenge, but I think that our

133
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:19,775
writing crew actually was able to come up with something that would allow it to, for the most

134
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:24,778
part, feel like Isaac could achieve all the goals that were put before him alone, but that when

135
00:07:24,838 --> 00:07:29,561
Carver was there, it felt like he was important and that, you know, him being there was an integral

136
00:07:29,581 --> 00:07:30,441
part of the narrative.

137
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:34,548
So by having this same core backbone story

138
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:37,131
throughout the whole game, we're allowed to have game progress

139
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:38,032
be shared between these.

140
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:40,834
Because since we want the single player in the co-op mode

141
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:44,658
to be sort of like peers on the same level of campaign-ness,

142
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:48,862
we want it to be that you can play up to chapter

143
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:49,622
five with your buddy.

144
00:07:50,423 --> 00:07:51,964
And then he can't play that day, and we

145
00:07:51,984 --> 00:07:52,825
don't want it to be, well, now you

146
00:07:52,845 --> 00:07:54,046
have to start the game over again.

147
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:58,864
So you can just continue at chapter 5 in the single player campaign and the game sort of

148
00:07:59,004 --> 00:08:02,690
automatically configures to what universe it is that you're currently decided to play in.

149
00:08:03,712 --> 00:08:06,735
And to encourage people to take advantage of this feature, which

150
00:08:07,095 --> 00:08:09,898
was obviously something that took a lot of work to implement,

151
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,980
we made it so you could freely move back and forth

152
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,620
between the modes.

153
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,042
So I can be single player and I can just invite someone in.

154
00:08:15,683 --> 00:08:18,085
And now, all of this sounds really great on paper,

155
00:08:18,465 --> 00:08:20,427
but then we take this to the engineers and they're like,

156
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:23,049
well, you had a level that we didn't

157
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:24,991
have doors in multiplayer in Dead Space 2.

158
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:25,632
Like, what?

159
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:29,255
So there's a lot of technological challenges

160
00:08:29,295 --> 00:08:30,596
that we had to deal with.

161
00:08:31,498 --> 00:08:35,741
in order to implement this. And actually during our design process we had to hang this sign in

162
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:40,125
our meeting room that says don't let science get in the way of awesome town. Because we kept having

163
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:44,808
this thing that's like oh I know we'll do this and then it's like uh no the engine doesn't do

164
00:08:44,848 --> 00:08:49,592
that and that will take you know two weeks to two months to implement. So we're like all right we're

165
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:54,076
just going to focus on the design for a little while. But eventually we have to start addressing

166
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:56,357
these technical issues and actually implement something right.

167
00:08:58,728 --> 00:09:01,872
This is just a very narrow view of the challenges we ran into.

168
00:09:01,952 --> 00:09:04,956
I'm looking at it mostly from the level designer perspective

169
00:09:05,076 --> 00:09:07,159
and things like scripting and level layout.

170
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,802
If you have larger questions of how did you

171
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:12,506
deal with low-level streaming issues or whatever,

172
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:14,569
just feel free to send me an email afterwards.

173
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,074
But as a level designer, one of the major things we're doing

174
00:09:18,134 --> 00:09:19,675
is setting up all of our scripting,

175
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:21,996
setting up all of our puzzles and combat

176
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:22,536
and things like that.

177
00:09:22,576 --> 00:09:24,457
So we had to figure out, how is it

178
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,438
that we're going to structure this?

179
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:27,979
And we went with the very industry standard way

180
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:29,960
of having all of the gameplay scripting

181
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,461
reside on the host machine.

182
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:33,882
And the client, for the most part,

183
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:35,523
is just sort of receiving information.

184
00:09:36,853 --> 00:09:39,135
But we immediately ran into an issue where it's like,

185
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:41,317
oh, well, I've got one player here and one player here.

186
00:09:41,677 --> 00:09:42,919
So they've got two different views.

187
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:46,142
So we had to make it so that the environment coloring

188
00:09:46,162 --> 00:09:48,704
or the visibility, the lighting, the VFX,

189
00:09:48,844 --> 00:09:50,346
things like that that are very positional

190
00:09:50,926 --> 00:09:52,988
are independent between host and client.

191
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,894
And one challenge that was a little unique to Dead Space is

192
00:09:57,194 --> 00:10:00,316
we have the ability to use the telekinesis ability, or TK,

193
00:10:00,617 --> 00:10:02,238
to pick up almost any object in the world.

194
00:10:02,258 --> 00:10:04,560
So I just, you know, like, I grab like a pickup,

195
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,021
and I'm moving it around in space.

196
00:10:06,582 --> 00:10:08,764
And initially, since those are gameplay relevant,

197
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:10,445
we had those be host controlled.

198
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:12,347
But as the client, it just felt terrible,

199
00:10:12,407 --> 00:10:14,008
because you're touching a thing,

200
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:15,649
and it has to go across the network and come back,

201
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:16,810
and it didn't feel responsive.

202
00:10:17,271 --> 00:10:19,252
So we ended up making it so that the authority

203
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:21,935
of any TK object is transferred to the client.

204
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:28,138
And that's really the one exception we had to make in terms of host controlling all the important stuff.

205
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,482
So once we kind of knew the high level layout of our level scripting,

206
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:38,244
how do we implement this whole multiverse, this two sort of universe thing?

207
00:10:38,765 --> 00:10:41,867
And one of the first things that we did was we had to come up with a way of setting,

208
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:45,449
all right, this is going to spawn in single player, this is going to spawn

209
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:49,371
in co-op, but only on the host, and this is going to spawn in

210
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:55,393
you know, on the client. And those are represented by these heads that you see in the upper right

211
00:10:55,433 --> 00:11:01,335
hand corner of these two entities from our editor. And why it's not just like an S, an H, and a C,

212
00:11:01,435 --> 00:11:07,277
you can ask our UI designer. But the good thing that came out of this is that when something

213
00:11:07,317 --> 00:11:10,738
wouldn't spawn on one thing or the other, we could refer to it as like, oh, well, your hats aren't

214
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:15,999
configured properly, or like, what's your current head situation? And

215
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:20,018
From there, you also see we have an example of the co-op gate,

216
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:22,381
which is the most dumb, simple thing ever.

217
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:25,023
But these are the kind of things that are awesome

218
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:26,324
when you're doing scripting, right?

219
00:11:26,664 --> 00:11:28,706
It just takes one input and then outputs

220
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:31,409
one message in single player and one message in multiplayer.

221
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:33,931
So if I want to have some sort of branching content,

222
00:11:33,971 --> 00:11:36,973
I want to have this cut scene happen in single player

223
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:38,455
and this cut scene happen in multiplayer,

224
00:11:38,755 --> 00:11:40,837
there's an easy way to do it as a level designer.

225
00:11:41,057 --> 00:11:42,638
You don't have to think about a lot of flags.

226
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:43,719
And the other thing is, is.

227
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,122
when we're going in and trying to final the game or trying to debug something,

228
00:11:47,142 --> 00:11:50,785
you know, me as one of the technical designers, I can go in and be like,

229
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:53,788
all right, show me all the co-op gates that are in this level,

230
00:11:54,308 --> 00:11:56,510
and I can get a good idea of how much branching we're doing,

231
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,093
and I can also make sure that our testing plan is covering all those different branches.

232
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:03,415
Because as soon as you start adding this in and you've got a 20-hour campaign,

233
00:12:03,996 --> 00:12:07,319
it's really hard to debug all that when you're trying to get the thing out the door.

234
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:10,721
So having something that's easily searchable is very important.

235
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:15,787
But we have to build content, right?

236
00:12:15,827 --> 00:12:17,808
We can't just put a bunch of scripting in a void.

237
00:12:18,228 --> 00:12:19,228
And we have to build levels.

238
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:21,989
And if you're dealing with data streaming, which

239
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:23,930
you're going to have to in any sort of a campaign game,

240
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,310
one of the big issues you're going to run into

241
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,631
is how do we gate these players?

242
00:12:26,991 --> 00:12:27,951
How do we keep them together?

243
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:30,252
Because all the scripting is executing on the host.

244
00:12:30,372 --> 00:12:31,832
So I can't have the client somewhere

245
00:12:31,872 --> 00:12:34,573
where a trigger is that isn't loaded yet on the host.

246
00:12:35,273 --> 00:12:37,254
And in Dead Space 1 and Dead Space 2,

247
00:12:38,514 --> 00:12:40,935
We had a kind of natural gating system.

248
00:12:41,235 --> 00:12:44,317
We just had these doors, and right here we have one hallway that's drawn,

249
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,478
and two closed doors.

250
00:12:46,878 --> 00:12:49,739
And if Isaac goes in forward, he just opens it up and it says,

251
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,740
all right, yeah, draw the next room, and if we need to stream it off the disk,

252
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,461
we have a natural gate for the player.

253
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:57,042
And this was something that we didn't really have to think about that much,

254
00:12:57,122 --> 00:12:59,343
because once we get to the next door, it's like,

255
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:00,524
oh, well, the door closed behind you.

256
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:03,865
So if we had guys in the first room, we can unspawn them and spawn guys

257
00:13:03,905 --> 00:13:05,846
in the next room, and everyone's happy.

258
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:08,147
In general, we draw two rooms at one time.

259
00:13:08,619 --> 00:13:15,169
and in general we have a way of air walking encounters. And then we get it running in co-op

260
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:17,813
and it's like, oh Carver, what are you doing? Right?

261
00:13:18,822 --> 00:13:24,566
Now we're drawing three rooms simultaneously, and I don't have a good way of air-walking these two combat encounters.

262
00:13:25,246 --> 00:13:29,249
So it's like, oh, what do we do? And we went down and did a lot of different sort of

263
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:33,792
investigations of like, well, maybe we should just get rid of this whole weird door system because it's kind of unique

264
00:13:34,252 --> 00:13:41,257
to the way games, you know, most games are built nowadays. But Dead Space is a lot of corridors, a lot of tight spaces.

265
00:13:42,107 --> 00:13:43,627
So we wanted to try to preserve that.

266
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,428
And we were lucky that we were able to come up

267
00:13:45,488 --> 00:13:48,488
with two relatively easy changes to our door code

268
00:13:48,508 --> 00:13:50,989
that allowed us to sort of enforce this behavior which

269
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:52,250
happened naturally before.

270
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,371
And that's only one door can be open at a time.

271
00:13:55,611 --> 00:13:57,831
When you open the door, all the other doors get disabled.

272
00:13:58,912 --> 00:14:01,152
And that door will remain open until both players

273
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:02,773
are on the same side of the door.

274
00:14:04,153 --> 00:14:06,314
And this solves issues where like, all right,

275
00:14:06,334 --> 00:14:07,755
they're separated, where's my buddy?

276
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:09,917
Or I just went off and triggered this door

277
00:14:10,477 --> 00:14:12,779
and screamed out the ground that my friend was standing on.

278
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,860
Or some other terrible thing.

279
00:14:15,141 --> 00:14:17,002
And these changes are relatively easy to implement

280
00:14:17,082 --> 00:14:19,744
and for the most part, preserved the player experience

281
00:14:20,164 --> 00:14:21,405
and the way that we built levels.

282
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,387
So we didn't have to re-architect the fundamental way

283
00:14:24,407 --> 00:14:25,908
that we connected our spaces.

284
00:14:27,012 --> 00:14:30,915
This is great, because now we've got a world where the door is open,

285
00:14:30,935 --> 00:14:32,276
but the next door is disabled.

286
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:35,459
We have to wait for both of them to be in that thing, and great.

287
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:37,040
We only draw two rooms at a time.

288
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:40,463
It's slightly less elegant than just moving through the space

289
00:14:40,703 --> 00:14:41,784
on your own in single player.

290
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:46,387
But in general, it works and allows us to build the game the way

291
00:14:46,428 --> 00:14:48,649
that we've built the game for two games already.

292
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,311
And once we have this pattern of.

293
00:14:52,354 --> 00:14:54,315
the way the doors behave in Dead Space 3,

294
00:14:54,355 --> 00:14:56,016
we can apply it to other things, right?

295
00:14:56,336 --> 00:14:58,056
So elevators, we just made sure that they

296
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,457
have a door on the outside.

297
00:14:59,977 --> 00:15:02,658
So all the other doors going into the room with the elevator

298
00:15:02,678 --> 00:15:04,079
have to be closed before it can open.

299
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,420
So the environment artists can go crazy

300
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,121
with the interiors of the elevators

301
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,921
or put whatever VFX they want in there.

302
00:15:10,622 --> 00:15:15,808
And the elevator can't leave until both players are inside on the same side of the door and

303
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:18,191
then the door can close and you can go to another floor.

304
00:15:18,812 --> 00:15:22,516
So it's the same pattern that we had before so we only have to sort of teach it once.

305
00:15:23,778 --> 00:15:27,582
But obviously if we made a game where you've got two players and they always have to be

306
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:29,624
you know within one or two rooms of each other...

307
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,398
it would be like, well, you're kind of undermining the point of adding in co-op.

308
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:36,981
So we kept the lifts, and we added in ladders

309
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:41,885
in a way that it didn't require the players to sort of work in tandem.

310
00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:43,847
One player could go to the top floor of a room,

311
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:45,128
and the other player could be on the bottom floor,

312
00:15:45,148 --> 00:15:46,890
and now we can have combat on two tiers.

313
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:50,033
Or we can allow players to take advantage of the weapons that they've crafted

314
00:15:50,393 --> 00:15:53,796
and sort of go to different layers of the space that they're fighting in.

315
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,422
And with that, we know this is how we're going to lay out our scripting.

316
00:15:59,703 --> 00:16:02,044
This is how we're going to implement these two universes.

317
00:16:02,404 --> 00:16:04,186
And we know that we can start building a space.

318
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:06,687
But there's this problem, right?

319
00:16:06,747 --> 00:16:09,770
Engineers had this whole path they had to go down

320
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,591
to figure out how do I spawn NPCs?

321
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:14,453
How do I get them to follow two different players simultaneously?

322
00:16:14,693 --> 00:16:16,554
But that wasn't so much of a design task.

323
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:21,418
What was a major level design challenge was, how do I balance this thing?

324
00:16:22,686 --> 00:16:24,867
Because we put in all this combat, place all their combat,

325
00:16:24,907 --> 00:16:25,768
and it's all for single player.

326
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:27,349
And it's like, oh, well, now we've got two guns.

327
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:28,950
This isn't challenging, right?

328
00:16:29,751 --> 00:16:31,532
And a Dead Space game with no challenge

329
00:16:31,712 --> 00:16:33,173
is not really a Dead Space game.

330
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:35,575
So we had to figure out a way of fixing this.

331
00:16:35,935 --> 00:16:37,916
And the first thing we tried was the really obvious thing

332
00:16:37,976 --> 00:16:40,698
of take that co-op gate and have it go to a single player

333
00:16:40,738 --> 00:16:42,379
encounter, and then make one that's harder

334
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,681
and have that one be the co-op encounter.

335
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:47,963
And we can do some of that by just putting in harder enemies,

336
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,825
tweaking their health values a little bit.

337
00:16:51,036 --> 00:16:54,717
But ultimately, our enemies in Dead Space are really expensive.

338
00:16:55,217 --> 00:16:57,017
They have all these different animation states.

339
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,038
They have all these ragdoll parts

340
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:00,898
that you can introduce by shooting off limbs.

341
00:17:01,598 --> 00:17:04,559
And we can only have about five or six of them at any one time.

342
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,260
And we're running up against that ceiling, even single player.

343
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,140
So this was a solution that worked about two to three times

344
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,501
per level, but wasn't something that we could just blanket

345
00:17:12,521 --> 00:17:13,321
through the whole game.

346
00:17:13,861 --> 00:17:16,622
And honestly, we didn't want to increase the number of enemies

347
00:17:16,962 --> 00:17:19,082
just everywhere when you were playing in co-op.

348
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:22,583
So we went to the engineers and were like, we need a fix for this.

349
00:17:23,123 --> 00:17:26,024
And they gave us these co-op damage multipliers that allow us to make

350
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:31,547
the enemies take a little less damage from you or deal a little more damage back to you in co-op.

351
00:17:31,987 --> 00:17:36,009
But obviously there's an upper limit on this because we have strategic dismemberment.

352
00:17:36,369 --> 00:17:40,631
So if I shoot a limb, you need to get feedback that you're receiving a damage multiplier by

353
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:44,333
shooting a limb and not the chest. So we can't start making bullet sponges

354
00:17:44,373 --> 00:17:46,114
or else you lose the feedback as a player.

355
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,835
And the other thing is, is we've got a hardcore mode,

356
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:50,616
where you have essentially permadeath.

357
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:53,378
And so we can't make it so as soon as you go into a hardcore

358
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:56,940
mode on, you know, Impossible, and you have a co-op buddy,

359
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,942
that one hit kills anyone, basically.

360
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:01,382
It would just, it wouldn't work.

361
00:18:02,238 --> 00:18:07,103
So we needed a third lever and that was aggression. So most of our enemies have a state where you

362
00:18:07,123 --> 00:18:11,108
shoot off enough limbs and they'll go berserk or they'll start swinging their arms at a higher

363
00:18:11,168 --> 00:18:16,734
rate and not taking breaks. And we just made it so that we could conditionally turn that on on

364
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:20,398
enemies. So if we wanted to have one guy that would help escalate the fight a little bit we

365
00:18:20,418 --> 00:18:22,600
could say all right in co-op you're just going to go wild.

366
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:25,522
And this actually encouraged the behavior that we wanted,

367
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:29,403
which is players covering each other and grappling

368
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:31,323
being a more common thing.

369
00:18:31,363 --> 00:18:33,844
So when our enemies grab you and you go into a button mash mode,

370
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:35,765
it gave the other player opportunities

371
00:18:35,785 --> 00:18:38,766
to have to shoot the enemies off the other player.

372
00:18:40,246 --> 00:18:42,987
There's another side to this point of combat,

373
00:18:43,307 --> 00:18:45,708
because killing all these enemies is draining your resources,

374
00:18:45,748 --> 00:18:46,588
your health, and your ammo.

375
00:18:47,028 --> 00:18:49,849
So we had to come up with a way of making the economy work

376
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:51,310
in co-op.

377
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,353
And initially, on our design land,

378
00:18:54,373 --> 00:18:57,195
we're having all these visions of players arguing over

379
00:18:57,255 --> 00:18:58,917
who gets to pick up on the ground,

380
00:18:58,997 --> 00:19:00,298
and all these kind of things.

381
00:19:00,358 --> 00:19:03,861
But ultimately, there was a lot of issues with this.

382
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:07,404
Because it basically meant that if we dropped one item out

383
00:19:07,424 --> 00:19:10,046
of every enemy still, that we had sort of half the items that

384
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,527
could go in any player's inventory.

385
00:19:13,007 --> 00:19:15,751
And we couldn't do the stuff that we do in Dead Space, which

386
00:19:15,832 --> 00:19:18,996
is look at how much health, how much ammo you have,

387
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:20,819
when the last time you got resources were,

388
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,102
and then tune the drops based on this information.

389
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,866
When you end up in a situation where one player has no ammo

390
00:19:25,906 --> 00:19:27,308
and the other one has no health, it's

391
00:19:27,328 --> 00:19:28,930
like, what do you put on the ground, right?

392
00:19:30,063 --> 00:19:32,185
And so we want to be able to take advantage of that.

393
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,946
And we ended up going down the path

394
00:19:33,966 --> 00:19:35,168
of having independent drops.

395
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:38,030
So you stomp a corpse, it drops one item on the host,

396
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,271
one item on the client.

397
00:19:39,872 --> 00:19:41,653
And this gets us around the issue of one player just

398
00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:42,875
gobbling up all of the items.

399
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:44,876
It allows us to use the balancing

400
00:19:44,936 --> 00:19:46,718
that we did in single player in co-op,

401
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:48,900
so we don't have to balance the game twice, which

402
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,362
is important, again, when you have a really long game

403
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:52,904
and a relatively small design team.

404
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:56,073
But we had quest items, right?

405
00:19:57,633 --> 00:20:00,233
You'd go through a dungeon and you'd get this magical item,

406
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:01,954
or some Tesla engine.

407
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:05,074
And it was a story moment when as soon as you picked it up.

408
00:20:05,334 --> 00:20:07,215
So we added this shared pickup flag

409
00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:09,875
that would make it so important story elements, things

410
00:20:09,895 --> 00:20:12,036
that were tied into the progression of the game,

411
00:20:12,216 --> 00:20:14,296
or things that we didn't want one player to miss

412
00:20:14,616 --> 00:20:15,696
at the bottom of a dungeon.

413
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:17,197
If you're getting a special log that

414
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:19,037
explains the whole reason why you did this for the last 20

415
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:21,077
minutes, we want both players to get it.

416
00:20:21,417 --> 00:20:23,058
So we turned those into shared pickups.

417
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:26,009
And that got around a lot of the limitations

418
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:30,038
that we had in doing this independent drop pattern.

419
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,263
But co-op isn't the only thing that we have in Dead Space.

420
00:20:35,764 --> 00:20:38,206
And also, combat isn't the only thing

421
00:20:38,226 --> 00:20:39,066
that we have in Dead Space.

422
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:40,547
There's activities and puzzles.

423
00:20:40,988 --> 00:20:43,410
And we have, historically, these large things

424
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,191
like the centrifuge puzzle in Dead Space 1.

425
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,733
We have the Gravitron puzzle in Dead Space 2.

426
00:20:48,554 --> 00:20:49,955
And we wanted to do even more of those

427
00:20:49,975 --> 00:20:51,616
to reinforce the idea that Isaac was an engineer.

428
00:20:52,156 --> 00:20:54,678
And so this was an important part of the single-player

429
00:20:54,698 --> 00:20:54,959
design.

430
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:57,160
And we wanted this to be reflected in co-op.

431
00:20:58,994 --> 00:21:01,475
And because we're building these large set piece environments

432
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:04,595
to support these puzzles, we wanted

433
00:21:04,655 --> 00:21:06,576
to make sure that they could be used in both,

434
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:09,877
because we couldn't just redesign the whole puzzle

435
00:21:09,897 --> 00:21:12,517
space if we were going to go into multiplayer.

436
00:21:13,057 --> 00:21:15,558
And at the same time, we wanted the second player

437
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:17,598
to feel like, oh, I'm actually helping solve this puzzle.

438
00:21:17,638 --> 00:21:19,819
It's not just like, I'm going to watch my buddy do it.

439
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,759
Because again, Carver needs to feel

440
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:23,320
like he's an important part of the narrative.

441
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:28,813
So to step through how sort of initially we struggled with this and then overcame it, I'm

442
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:32,136
going to go through one of the first major set piece puzzles that we have in the game. It's in

443
00:21:32,156 --> 00:21:37,500
the CMS Roanoke and you come into this big generator room and you need to restore the

444
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,082
power so you can get to your buddies that are up in this command saucer. And initially we

445
00:21:41,102 --> 00:21:45,566
had this gigantic circuit board with all these sliding breakers and you needed to align

446
00:21:45,586 --> 00:21:50,810
them with connectors in order to, you know, be able to start the generator up. It was kind

447
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,452
of interesting. It was a little abstract but I liked it a lot.

448
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,713
and in single player it worked but you had to move everything in sort of a particular order

449
00:21:59,853 --> 00:22:04,717
and when we got it up in co-op there was two major problems. One is that if there's any lag

450
00:22:04,737 --> 00:22:08,580
on the network you're kind of drawing two dynamic havoc objects into each other and they can get

451
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:15,284
stuck and just things go crazy really fast with dynamic constraints. And the other thing was

452
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:20,288
that solving this kind of felt like two people trying to solve a ruby cube at one time.

453
00:22:21,624 --> 00:22:24,166
It was like, you could be like, oh, this is what I'm doing.

454
00:22:24,206 --> 00:22:25,026
I'm going to move this here.

455
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:27,148
And you have a plan, right, that's multiple steps.

456
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:29,330
But then your other guy is doing something

457
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,071
that's counter to that.

458
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:32,513
And unless you're on a microphone coordinating in some way,

459
00:22:32,553 --> 00:22:33,634
it just didn't really work.

460
00:22:34,575 --> 00:22:36,036
So it was obvious that we needed to go back

461
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:37,017
to the drawing board on this.

462
00:22:37,777 --> 00:22:40,279
What we ended up doing was creating

463
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,742
three separate instances of one action

464
00:22:43,802 --> 00:22:44,983
that was relatively simple.

465
00:22:45,023 --> 00:22:45,944
It was one step.

466
00:22:46,605 --> 00:22:47,065
And it's these.

467
00:22:48,794 --> 00:22:52,738
We have this turning handle here that you can see sort of in the foreground and that rotates a coil

468
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,904
and on the outside you can see it kind of on the left there's a ring of magnets and so the overall

469
00:22:58,924 --> 00:23:04,029
goal here is you know TK the ring of magnets around the coil and then spin the coil in order

470
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:09,253
to generate some electricity and it's a relatively simple act in single player you just move the

471
00:23:09,274 --> 00:23:12,276
thing in place and spin it and it walks there and you're good.

472
00:23:13,403 --> 00:23:15,245
And we can do ramping external from that

473
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:17,486
by throwing in enemies, having environmental hazards.

474
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:19,087
And so we can have the difficulty ramp

475
00:23:19,227 --> 00:23:20,848
be external from the activity.

476
00:23:21,729 --> 00:23:23,810
And when we're in co-op, the important thing

477
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,731
is, once you get it one time, it's

478
00:23:25,831 --> 00:23:27,172
easy to communicate what you need

479
00:23:27,192 --> 00:23:30,314
to do in the subsequent phases of this activity.

480
00:23:30,835 --> 00:23:33,116
And the other thing is that the actions you need to perform

481
00:23:33,316 --> 00:23:34,937
are independent.

482
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:36,979
So one player's sliding it up and down,

483
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:40,461
and the other player is rotating the coil in the center.

484
00:23:42,157 --> 00:23:45,360
And you need to coordinate at one instant.

485
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,842
But it's not like you can be moving the thing up and down

486
00:23:47,902 --> 00:23:50,284
and stop the player from rotating it, right?

487
00:23:50,825 --> 00:23:53,767
So you don't feel like you're fighting each other.

488
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:54,868
You feel like you're coordinating.

489
00:23:54,968 --> 00:23:58,071
And this pattern of hold this in place while I do x

490
00:23:58,511 --> 00:24:00,393
was actually something that was super successful.

491
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:02,895
And we used throughout the game in sort of different guises.

492
00:24:03,215 --> 00:24:06,718
Because it was a relatively easy thing to teach to the player

493
00:24:07,099 --> 00:24:09,240
and to script one way or the other.

494
00:24:10,035 --> 00:24:14,017
Really, there's only one downside that we found to this pattern or this solution,

495
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:19,461
which is that you have to use two Xbox controllers or PS3 controllers, whatever platform you're on,

496
00:24:19,801 --> 00:24:23,464
in order to actually test your scripting, right? So you have, you're doing all these crazy sort

497
00:24:23,484 --> 00:24:26,846
of hand contortions of like, oh, I'm going to aim and hold that while I then do this on the

498
00:24:26,926 --> 00:24:30,929
other leg or whatever. So if you're going to be making a co-op game, I highly recommend,

499
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:37,053
like, getting some interns or something to just sit in your cube and, yeah, help you test your,

500
00:24:37,273 --> 00:24:39,415
test your co-op scripting because your neighbors will get tired of it.

501
00:24:40,684 --> 00:24:45,926
So one thing that this deals with is another side effect

502
00:24:46,226 --> 00:24:48,987
of having both players needing to be physically connected

503
00:24:49,047 --> 00:24:52,008
via a TK beam to this object is this problem

504
00:24:52,028 --> 00:24:54,188
of two cameras at once.

505
00:24:54,608 --> 00:24:55,929
This is something that's come up before when

506
00:24:55,949 --> 00:24:58,229
we were talking about performance scripting and doors

507
00:24:58,269 --> 00:24:58,910
and things like that.

508
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,770
But in puzzles, it's also really hard

509
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,231
because if you come into a room and you've

510
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:02,951
got a trigger that

511
00:25:03,411 --> 00:25:05,333
you know, makes the thing you need to shoot spark.

512
00:25:05,693 --> 00:25:07,214
But it only does that one time.

513
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:09,576
The other player, that's the guy that's gonna figure it out,

514
00:25:10,156 --> 00:25:11,637
is like looking somewhere else.

515
00:25:11,657 --> 00:25:13,398
He's down a ladder, he's in some other room,

516
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:14,840
who knows what, stomping a corpse.

517
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,581
and they miss this cue.

518
00:25:17,921 --> 00:25:19,581
So messaging becomes something that you really

519
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,442
have to think about when you're dealing with these two cameras.

520
00:25:22,962 --> 00:25:24,363
And so while it wasn't necessarily

521
00:25:24,403 --> 00:25:26,944
required in this particular generator puzzle example,

522
00:25:27,344 --> 00:25:30,805
we ended up testing out this idea of a centralized console.

523
00:25:30,885 --> 00:25:32,265
And we used this a number of times.

524
00:25:32,685 --> 00:25:35,066
So we've got a central console that you

525
00:25:35,106 --> 00:25:36,247
see when you first come in, and it

526
00:25:36,347 --> 00:25:38,687
has the information of the state of whatever activity

527
00:25:38,727 --> 00:25:39,488
you're currently doing.

528
00:25:39,908 --> 00:25:41,168
It gives you output, and it's got

529
00:25:41,188 --> 00:25:43,429
everything labeled that ties into the other generators

530
00:25:43,449 --> 00:25:43,929
that you'll see.

531
00:25:45,183 --> 00:25:48,686
It also functions as a logical place to send the players back

532
00:25:48,726 --> 00:25:50,647
to when you want to do sort of the final moment.

533
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,208
Because if we want to have a cut scene

534
00:25:52,228 --> 00:25:55,589
or we want to have a reveal of some sort of VFX show,

535
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:58,331
it gives us a way to pull the players back into that space

536
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:00,072
in a way that's player controlled.

537
00:26:00,112 --> 00:26:02,113
We don't have to do a camera cut.

538
00:26:02,393 --> 00:26:04,375
We can send the players there and we've got two switches

539
00:26:04,415 --> 00:26:05,995
that they have to press simultaneously.

540
00:26:06,015 --> 00:26:08,717
And this is a lot like a pressure pad.

541
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,178
It's very gamey in some ways.

542
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:15,581
By building a console that felt like you're arming a bomb and both people have to turn

543
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:21,103
the keys simultaneously to activate it, I think we were able to fictionalize this traditional

544
00:26:21,123 --> 00:26:24,485
game mechanic in a way that fit within the Dead Space universe, and that was a huge boon

545
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:28,847
in terms of us being able to do whatever we wanted as level designers, but then send them

546
00:26:28,887 --> 00:26:33,949
to the place that the animation team was demanding that we get the players to move forward in

547
00:26:33,989 --> 00:26:34,389
the story.

548
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:40,119
You know, we've got combat, and we've got activities, puzzles,

549
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:41,200
interactions with the world.

550
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,601
So sort of the core bare bones things

551
00:26:43,641 --> 00:26:46,022
that you need to make a Dead Space campaign are there.

552
00:26:46,762 --> 00:26:48,803
But at this point, we haven't really

553
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:51,064
done anything with the co-op mechanic

554
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:54,066
that is unique or expands the Dead Space experience

555
00:26:54,886 --> 00:26:56,547
in some sort of meaningful way.

556
00:26:56,707 --> 00:26:58,808
We've basically just found a way for two players

557
00:26:58,848 --> 00:27:01,809
to play Dead Space, which is great,

558
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:04,330
but it'd be optimal if we could find a way

559
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,431
to take that a little further.

560
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:09,894
So I kind of like this story because it comes out of a bug.

561
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:15,783
And we would script the game so that we have a prop,

562
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,606
something great, like the sun prop.

563
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:19,390
from Dead Space 2.

564
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,412
And it shows up great on the host.

565
00:27:22,472 --> 00:27:25,273
I'm playing as Isaac, and it's like, awesome, Sunprop.

566
00:27:25,714 --> 00:27:27,315
And then I connect in co-op, and it's

567
00:27:27,335 --> 00:27:30,357
like, there's a Sunprop-shaped void in my life.

568
00:27:30,997 --> 00:27:31,978
I'm not seeing it right now.

569
00:27:32,058 --> 00:27:33,779
And normally, this is a heads issue, right?

570
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,880
We're just not wearing the right hats,

571
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,722
and it's not spawning on the client.

572
00:27:38,642 --> 00:27:41,604
But it's easy to fix.

573
00:27:41,684 --> 00:27:43,465
But we started thinking, well, what

574
00:27:43,565 --> 00:27:46,387
if that was how it was supposed to be, right?

575
00:27:46,467 --> 00:27:47,568
What if we want to have?

576
00:27:48,512 --> 00:27:54,697
the sun be on one machine and then have something really terrifying on the client, like the

577
00:27:54,737 --> 00:28:03,665
alarm clock from Dead Space 2. And this might be really interesting. How do we leverage

578
00:28:03,705 --> 00:28:08,228
this? And we're actually really lucky that on one hand, pretty much every character in

579
00:28:08,248 --> 00:28:12,872
the Dead Space universe is either insane or on the road to insanity.

580
00:28:13,964 --> 00:28:18,946
And we also had this whole backstory for Carver that we created for the comic Dead Space Liberation

581
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:24,087
that we hadn't necessarily explored fully in the main campaign, right?

582
00:28:24,107 --> 00:28:27,588
Because it's mostly about Isaac and Carver's relationship when you're playing co-op.

583
00:28:27,648 --> 00:28:29,969
It's not necessarily about Carver's backstory.

584
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:32,329
We just built that to flesh him out within the universe.

585
00:28:33,174 --> 00:28:38,355
So we thought, well, what if we make some co-op only missions that are focused on Carver

586
00:28:38,395 --> 00:28:42,517
and we can take advantage of the fact that he hasn't sort of dealt with his inner demons

587
00:28:42,557 --> 00:28:46,838
in the way Isaac did in Dead Space 2, and start making, you know, toy soldiers appear

588
00:28:46,878 --> 00:28:52,719
all over the place for the client, but on Isaac's machine it's just seeing like a box

589
00:28:52,959 --> 00:28:55,980
or some artifact from the alien dig site or something like that.

590
00:28:57,164 --> 00:28:58,244
And so we start doing that.

591
00:28:58,545 --> 00:29:00,205
And then we start thinking, oh, well,

592
00:29:00,325 --> 00:29:02,846
what if we have a scurrying sound that only appears

593
00:29:02,906 --> 00:29:04,707
on one machine, and that's random?

594
00:29:05,147 --> 00:29:06,227
And then you're playing on the mic,

595
00:29:06,247 --> 00:29:07,928
and it's like, hey, did you hear that?

596
00:29:08,588 --> 00:29:10,369
Or then we put in an audio log where.

597
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,471
One player is just hearing something that's like,

598
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:14,233
oh, hey, you need to go do this and get this.

599
00:29:14,393 --> 00:29:15,394
And then the other player just starts

600
00:29:15,434 --> 00:29:18,096
hearing someone screaming the entire time.

601
00:29:18,196 --> 00:29:20,298
And so we just started having more and more fun

602
00:29:20,338 --> 00:29:22,700
with this idea of how could we create this divergence.

603
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,401
Because we've already got a single player

604
00:29:24,461 --> 00:29:25,742
and a multiplayer campaign.

605
00:29:25,783 --> 00:29:26,863
But then it's like, well, what if we

606
00:29:26,923 --> 00:29:29,025
fracture that multiplayer campaign into kind of?

607
00:29:29,326 --> 00:29:32,709
two more universes where we've got what one player experiences and the other

608
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,589
player experiences.

609
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,433
As we're trying to take this idea of two cameras that up until this point had

610
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:37,733
been

611
00:29:38,114 --> 00:29:41,517
kind of a burden, something that we kept being like, god damn it, we got these

612
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:45,580
two players in their two different positions. It's like, how do we leverage that, right?

613
00:29:46,381 --> 00:29:49,685
And so this all sort of culminated in us thinking back,

614
00:29:50,145 --> 00:29:52,468
well, you know, in Dead Space 2, we,

615
00:29:52,908 --> 00:29:54,310
you know, spoiler alert, I'm sorry,

616
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:57,293
Isaac kind of goes into his own mind

617
00:29:57,353 --> 00:29:58,675
and has to confront these issues

618
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:00,056
that he's had for two games

619
00:30:00,357 --> 00:30:01,998
into this place that we call Dementia Land.

620
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,301
And Carver hasn't gone through this same process.

621
00:30:05,922 --> 00:30:07,283
And also, if you play Dead Space 2,

622
00:30:07,483 --> 00:30:09,685
you know that if you die, we transfer back to the real world

623
00:30:09,745 --> 00:30:11,986
and have sort of established that this whole thing happens

624
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:15,208
in Isaac's mind, and he's just really standing in reality.

625
00:30:15,469 --> 00:30:16,509
So we're like, well, what if we could

626
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:18,511
have someone that's standing in reality

627
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:20,612
and another person that's going inside of his head?

628
00:30:21,073 --> 00:30:22,293
And so we created these sequences

629
00:30:22,334 --> 00:30:24,235
where we teleport Carver into his mind,

630
00:30:24,275 --> 00:30:26,877
and we have all these things that are being told,

631
00:30:26,937 --> 00:30:28,658
or he's seeing reenactments of.

632
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:31,821
you know, some of the terrible stuff that happened in his backstory,

633
00:30:32,201 --> 00:30:36,505
while Isaac is just seeing Carver kind of raving on the ground and has to cover him from being attacked.

634
00:30:37,246 --> 00:30:40,869
And now we're really taking advantage, I think, of the fact that we have

635
00:30:41,329 --> 00:30:44,952
two players that are in two different things, and we've reintroduced this kind of uncertainty

636
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:47,555
that you had when you were playing alone.

637
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:52,130
you know, in Dead Space 1 and Dead Space 2, and it's kind of, we found a way to reintroduce

638
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:56,552
some of that, the spirit of that, I think, in co-op. Because, you know, a lot of the,

639
00:30:56,672 --> 00:30:59,313
there's a lot of struggles when you're talking on a mic, you're just like, oh, I'm gonna go get

640
00:30:59,353 --> 00:31:02,955
dinner or whatever, right? And it's hard to be immersed in that way. But when you start playing

641
00:31:03,015 --> 00:31:06,896
with what's real between the two players, I think it does something really interesting.

642
00:31:08,131 --> 00:31:10,712
And this is something that we explored a lot in Dead Space

643
00:31:10,752 --> 00:31:11,172
Awakened.

644
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,693
Because one of the things that became obvious to us

645
00:31:13,793 --> 00:31:16,514
as we wrapped up Dead Space 3 was that this is something

646
00:31:16,534 --> 00:31:19,535
that we really wish we'd been able to build upon more,

647
00:31:19,555 --> 00:31:21,175
and we'd been able to do some more interesting things

648
00:31:21,235 --> 00:31:22,936
with the Isaac side of the equation.

649
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:25,757
So this is something we really played around there.

650
00:31:25,777 --> 00:31:28,018
And if there's one thing that I think in Dead Space 3

651
00:31:28,198 --> 00:31:30,058
I could expand upon the concept of,

652
00:31:30,499 --> 00:31:33,179
it would be this idea of a fractured world

653
00:31:33,219 --> 00:31:34,720
between single player and multiplayer.

654
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,321
And with that.

655
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:43,455
We've kind of gone through all of the major phases of development and we've come up with

656
00:31:43,496 --> 00:31:46,599
a concept where like this is what co-op means to Dead Space.

657
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:51,064
We dealt with kind of the level design technical challenges of alright this is how we're going

658
00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:51,624
to be able to do it.

659
00:31:52,965 --> 00:31:54,786
We figured out how to transfer the gameplay over

660
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:57,568
so that we can create mostly the same sort of balanced experience

661
00:31:57,588 --> 00:32:00,910
that you had in Dead Space 2 or Dead Space 3 single player

662
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,311
into this new co-op world.

663
00:32:02,891 --> 00:32:04,853
And we found a way, I think, through this sort

664
00:32:04,893 --> 00:32:08,855
of fractured environment to create something that feels

665
00:32:08,915 --> 00:32:10,416
very, very Dead Space, but it's something

666
00:32:10,436 --> 00:32:13,078
that didn't exist in the franchise previous to this game.

667
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:16,521
So in a lot of ways, we found a way to take this feature

668
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:18,342
and have it actually add to the franchise

669
00:32:18,362 --> 00:32:20,563
in a meaningful way, which is really important with something

670
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:21,944
like this core, right?

671
00:32:22,785 --> 00:32:26,009
And through all of these things, I think there's a number of lessons that you could take.

672
00:32:26,089 --> 00:32:30,934
And, you know, if you want to ask me questions later tonight, I could talk for hours about this.

673
00:32:31,275 --> 00:32:33,757
But I think the most important thing that's most applicable to, you know,

674
00:32:34,298 --> 00:32:37,782
whatever game you're going to make, because you're not going to go make a Dead Space co-op game.

675
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,284
is that you should create useful patterns.

676
00:32:40,744 --> 00:32:43,065
Because making games is really, really hard.

677
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:44,926
And if you're, as a level designer,

678
00:32:44,966 --> 00:32:46,307
continually having to be like, well,

679
00:32:46,347 --> 00:32:47,628
how do I keep the players together?

680
00:32:47,928 --> 00:32:49,709
How do I introduce enemies into the scene?

681
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,491
How do I line up this character to start this animation, right?

682
00:32:52,751 --> 00:32:54,091
You're spending all of your time worrying

683
00:32:54,132 --> 00:32:55,292
about these kind of problems when

684
00:32:55,312 --> 00:32:56,333
you're building a level layout.

685
00:32:56,373 --> 00:32:58,294
And you're not getting to the point where it's like, all

686
00:32:58,314 --> 00:33:00,735
right, well, how can I make interesting permutations?

687
00:33:01,436 --> 00:33:03,538
of these gameplay items that I already have,

688
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:06,101
or how can I take these existing patterns

689
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:08,923
and turn them into something interesting, right?

690
00:33:08,984 --> 00:33:10,605
It was only when we had the foundation

691
00:33:10,685 --> 00:33:12,807
laid down on the ground and we could stand back

692
00:33:12,848 --> 00:33:14,209
and look at what we'd built that we're like,

693
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:15,710
you know what, I think we could do something

694
00:33:15,751 --> 00:33:16,451
interesting with this.

695
00:33:17,112 --> 00:33:19,394
And so getting to that point as fast as possible is good.

696
00:33:19,835 --> 00:33:22,237
So solving a problem in a way that solves it one time.

697
00:33:22,958 --> 00:33:26,983
sure, but if you can find a way to solve that problem in a way that's repeatable and makes it so

698
00:33:27,283 --> 00:33:33,770
future instances of that same kind of class of issue can be overcome easier, then great, because

699
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:37,775
that's going to give you the time to add the stuff to your game that really matters. Because I think

700
00:33:37,795 --> 00:33:38,796
there's a combination of...

701
00:33:39,577 --> 00:33:42,558
you know, having unique ideas, good new ideas,

702
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:44,579
but then also having a strong foundation

703
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:46,080
that's executed really well,

704
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,242
combined with a story or a fiction

705
00:33:49,302 --> 00:33:52,143
or some sort of hook that really draws the player in,

706
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:53,944
that creates a really quality product

707
00:33:54,004 --> 00:33:55,085
that players are going to enjoy.

708
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:57,226
So, and I think this is something that can apply

709
00:33:57,266 --> 00:33:59,187
to really anything that you're building.

710
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:01,508
With that, I think we have a little bit of time

711
00:34:01,548 --> 00:34:04,809
for Q&A before we move on to the next talk.

712
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,310
So feel free to send me an email.

713
00:34:14,276 --> 00:34:15,777
All right, so we got 10 minutes.

714
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:18,518
Just step up to mics.

715
00:34:19,799 --> 00:34:22,080
OK, yeah, because we're going to have to do a machine switch,

716
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,501
we'll do two or three questions.

717
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:25,439
Yeah.

718
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:25,899
Hi.

719
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:27,480
That was a really good talk, by the way.

720
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:27,920
Thank you.

721
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,420
But so did you guys run into any problems?

722
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,861
And if you did, how would you solve with the scary sequences

723
00:34:34,901 --> 00:34:37,022
where you would maybe see something scary in co-op?

724
00:34:37,662 --> 00:34:40,663
Like, did you guys have any trouble with that?

725
00:34:40,683 --> 00:34:42,423
Because the players might be looking at different things.

726
00:34:42,523 --> 00:34:43,623
So would you have something that you

727
00:34:43,683 --> 00:34:46,904
wanted the players to look at to be scary at the moment,

728
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,845
and it wouldn't work out for both of them?

729
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:55,691
I think that, in general, our approach was, if one player is going to see it, that's fine.

730
00:34:56,771 --> 00:35:00,814
Right? So, we've got, like, in the Roanoke, one of the early things that we do,

731
00:35:01,294 --> 00:35:04,736
we have a door that opens and you immediately see, like, a Weeper crawling up

732
00:35:04,756 --> 00:35:06,437
and it'll cast a shadow into the other room.

733
00:35:07,337 --> 00:35:09,979
As far as I'm concerned, if the other player reacts to it,

734
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:12,180
and, you know, I'm the other guy on the other side of the room,

735
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,862
and I see him, like, running back or firing his gun at something,

736
00:35:15,262 --> 00:35:17,623
that works too, and it keeps you immersed in the space, right?

737
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:20,785
As much as I can, I don't want to take control away

738
00:35:20,805 --> 00:35:21,345
from the player.

739
00:35:21,425 --> 00:35:24,527
If you can find a way to set both things up simultaneously,

740
00:35:24,587 --> 00:35:25,007
that's good.

741
00:35:25,067 --> 00:35:26,788
But if it starts feeling too scripted,

742
00:35:27,189 --> 00:35:31,111
you take away the natural kind of immersion that happens.

743
00:35:31,511 --> 00:35:34,413
Audio also really helps because normally you're

744
00:35:34,453 --> 00:35:36,034
in the same audio space, even if you're not

745
00:35:36,054 --> 00:35:36,954
looking the same direction.

746
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:39,315
So it's always been an important part of Dead Space,

747
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:40,736
but it was kind of doubly so in Dead Space 3.

748
00:35:40,776 --> 00:35:42,617
Thank you.

749
00:35:44,018 --> 00:35:44,498
We'll do the middle.

750
00:35:45,458 --> 00:35:57,872
When it comes to doing airlocks in co-ops, specifically, if you had the second player just sitting outside somewhere, did you do anything about that specifically?

751
00:35:57,952 --> 00:36:02,437
Like, did you teleport them in, or did you give the host the option to kick them or something, or what?

752
00:36:03,078 --> 00:36:03,238
So...

753
00:36:04,445 --> 00:36:07,766
If at all possible, we tried to never teleport the player.

754
00:36:08,986 --> 00:36:10,667
In Dead Space 2, we actually tried

755
00:36:10,687 --> 00:36:13,147
to make sure that we never had a camera cut in the game.

756
00:36:13,187 --> 00:36:14,548
There's a few times that we do it.

757
00:36:15,208 --> 00:36:17,588
We had to break that rule on Dead Space 3

758
00:36:17,628 --> 00:36:19,989
a little bit more than we would have previously.

759
00:36:20,509 --> 00:36:23,730
But we actually created things called the Lazy Susans, which

760
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:27,451
are these self-contained heat airlocks that you get in,

761
00:36:27,491 --> 00:36:29,951
and it rotates, and then you pop out the other side

762
00:36:30,491 --> 00:36:31,792
for those kind of situations.

763
00:36:31,932 --> 00:36:34,072
Because we realized at a certain point, like.

764
00:36:34,553 --> 00:36:39,562
Oh crap. We've got like a tent and a gigantic outdoor canyon. How do we make this work?

765
00:36:40,043 --> 00:36:45,895
So we sort of fictionalized these heat exchange devices that we called Lazy Susans and that solved

766
00:36:45,915 --> 00:36:46,416
that problem.

767
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:51,900
So you guys have amazing environments in your game.

768
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,261
I'm curious, like we heard from the Skyrim guys,

769
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:55,801
like they have the kits and that's how they make

770
00:36:56,101 --> 00:36:57,222
massive amounts of content.

771
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,442
But your guys' levels are so, you know,

772
00:36:59,482 --> 00:37:01,483
like heavy on art, at least in the end product.

773
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:03,724
What do you, do you guys draw on graph paper?

774
00:37:03,784 --> 00:37:05,364
Like do you guys rough it out?

775
00:37:05,404 --> 00:37:06,405
How do you guys build levels?

776
00:37:07,085 --> 00:37:11,587
We white box in Maya to begin with and we also

777
00:37:12,788 --> 00:37:15,810
When when Joel sent out his talk earlier

778
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:20,833
This is what I sort of tweeted about like my mind was blown of like why didn't I get this a while ago?

779
00:37:21,253 --> 00:37:25,755
Because all of our side dungeons and stuff we realized we were building so much game in Dead Space 3

780
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,117
That we needed to start

781
00:37:28,817 --> 00:37:30,899
you know, actually using some sort of tile models.

782
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:33,541
And we actually did that in this game a little bit,

783
00:37:33,581 --> 00:37:35,583
just because the sheer scale of the game

784
00:37:35,623 --> 00:37:36,324
that we were building.

785
00:37:37,425 --> 00:37:39,727
But we do custom what we call phase C,

786
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,889
which is the last sort of pass of going in,

787
00:37:41,969 --> 00:37:43,810
putting our blood and our hand prints and everything.

788
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:45,692
That's unique per room.

789
00:37:46,292 --> 00:37:47,994
So that's sort of how we balance that out.

790
00:37:48,454 --> 00:37:49,976
Okay, so you'll block that in Maya,

791
00:37:50,016 --> 00:37:51,497
and then do you just put in like ground triggers

792
00:37:51,557 --> 00:37:52,858
and stuff like that to move around your...

793
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:58,919
We block the whole space out in Maya in very rough shapes,

794
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:01,861
and then work with the art team on a phase

795
00:38:01,881 --> 00:38:04,483
that we call art block, where they take the LD block

796
00:38:04,523 --> 00:38:06,944
and turn it into something that looks somewhat logical

797
00:38:07,124 --> 00:38:09,346
from sort of my deranged sketches.

798
00:38:09,986 --> 00:38:10,186
Right.

799
00:38:10,807 --> 00:38:11,687
Cool, thank you very much.

800
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:16,771
Yeah, all right.
