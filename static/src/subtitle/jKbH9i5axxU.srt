1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:13,734
Okay, good afternoon, everyone. Let's get started. But before we do, and wow, I see a mask over there, too, in the audience.

2
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:24,460
So a few things. Please turn off your phones. So we're not distracted or interrupted by anyone's phones ringing.

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,004
And then we kindly ask you that you fill out a survey that you will get via email

4
00:00:30,604 --> 00:00:32,566
under the email address that you, I think, registered.

5
00:00:33,326 --> 00:00:39,831
And we do kindly ask that you refrain from taking photos of Yoko-san on stage.

6
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:43,013
You're more than welcome to take photos of the slides today.

7
00:00:44,354 --> 00:00:48,838
And as you can see, we have two speakers and we're covering a lot.

8
00:00:49,018 --> 00:00:52,501
So, the QA session may or may not happen.

9
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:55,924
It will all depend on how much time we have left, OK?

10
00:00:56,584 --> 00:00:59,727
So, without further ado, I'm going to hand it over to the speakers.

11
00:00:59,747 --> 00:01:04,691
All right.

12
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:04,891
All right.

13
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:05,091
Thank you.

14
00:01:22,989 --> 00:01:33,736
Hello everyone, those sitting on the side, especially on this side, you might be able to see part of my face, but just pretend that you're not seeing it and that you can only see the mask.

15
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:39,000
We made a game called Nier Automata, and we'd like to talk about that game today.

16
00:01:43,059 --> 00:01:46,941
In the first half, we'll talk about action, and in the second half, we'll talk about freedom.

17
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:10,074
So, without further ado, I'm going to hand it over to Taura-san.

18
00:02:10,094 --> 00:02:10,314
Thank you.

19
00:02:10,354 --> 00:02:12,435
Nice to meet you. I'm Takashi Sato, a game designer for PlatinumGames.

20
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:34,129
Hello, everyone.

21
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,190
My name is Takahisa Taura.

22
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,972
I am a game designer from Platinum Games.

23
00:02:41,053 --> 00:02:44,875
We have been planning for the player character and enemies

24
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:46,836
with the titles that you can see on the screen.

25
00:02:46,856 --> 00:02:48,277
When we are making a game,

26
00:02:48,297 --> 00:02:50,078
we try to make it a game that you can enjoy

27
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:51,199
by just pressing a button.

28
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:53,200
I would like to talk about some of the reasons for this.

29
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,738
So my primary job and role, there are some titles on the slides here, but I'm primarily

30
00:03:05,798 --> 00:03:09,241
responsible for player character and enemy planning and design.

31
00:03:10,102 --> 00:03:14,987
On every game that we make, we strive to make sure that even the just act of pushing a button

32
00:03:15,207 --> 00:03:15,667
is fun.

33
00:03:15,808 --> 00:03:21,533
So I'm going to elaborate on that a little bit more using or talking about NieR Automata

34
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:22,594
as an example.

35
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:29,991
I have approached a number of things to make the action fun.

36
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:33,053
I will talk about three important things.

37
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:36,995
So we take a number of approaches to making the action fun

38
00:03:37,655 --> 00:03:39,657
from the moment you first touch the game.

39
00:03:39,917 --> 00:03:43,479
Today I'd like to talk about these three key topics in particular.

40
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:45,841
The first one, although it may seem pretty basic,

41
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:46,741
is to envision your ideal.

42
00:03:55,822 --> 00:03:57,623
What I mean by that ideal is...

43
00:04:03,727 --> 00:04:05,929
So from the get-go, from the very, very beginning,

44
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:11,053
you need to firmly decide for yourselves what you want and what you don't want.

45
00:04:11,073 --> 00:04:17,337
It's a given, but the feeling of the game changes depending on the player's preferences and the content of the game.

46
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:22,617
So maybe it goes without saying, but the impression of a game

47
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:27,420
varies depending on the player's taste

48
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,501
and on the type of game you're trying to make.

49
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:37,624
To give an example of what I mean by that is,

50
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:39,485
if you're making a game like Dark Souls,

51
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:42,406
then putting in something like Bayonetta-like action

52
00:04:42,546 --> 00:04:43,967
is definitely not going to work.

53
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:46,408
So what I'm about to talk about doesn't apply to all games.

54
00:04:48,981 --> 00:04:52,624
So with that in mind, what I'm about to talk to you about today

55
00:04:53,005 --> 00:04:54,686
doesn't apply to every single game.

56
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:57,169
And the second topic is,

57
00:04:57,289 --> 00:05:02,253
are you able to make specific, precise, and sort of accurate criticism

58
00:05:02,273 --> 00:05:03,074
on what needs to be changed?

59
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:34,250
When you imagine in your head what you want the ideal form to be, and then compare that to what you see on the screen in front of you, if you can't explain what's good and what's bad and point those things out, you're not going to be able to create that ideal.

60
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,091
There are many reasons why you feel good and bad.

61
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:41,413
And there are all sorts of factors that affect

62
00:05:41,493 --> 00:05:43,855
whether a game feels good or not.

63
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:48,919
For example, if you increase the quality of the animation itself,

64
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,141
the connection to the animation,

65
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:51,462
the good things about the input,

66
00:05:51,862 --> 00:05:53,844
and the effect SE, there are many possibilities,

67
00:05:53,864 --> 00:05:55,365
but in any case, everything that appears on the screen

68
00:05:55,445 --> 00:05:56,086
is the cause of it.

69
00:05:58,477 --> 00:06:02,860
The range is quite wide, from the quality of the animations themselves,

70
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,464
to whether they connect each other, and how smoothly they connect each other,

71
00:06:07,904 --> 00:06:12,368
to the responsiveness of the player input, to the visuals and the sound effects.

72
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:18,153
The list goes on, but every single thing that you see on the screen is a factor.

73
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:22,736
One of the things that we were particularly focused on in PlatinumGames' NieR Automata

74
00:06:22,776 --> 00:06:24,278
was improving the response to input.

75
00:06:28,476 --> 00:06:31,178
And amongst those, which is a very long list, like I said,

76
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:34,420
when it came to NieR Automata, we at Platinum Games

77
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,322
were especially concerned about making the response

78
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:40,384
to the player input feel really good.

79
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:42,385
And to elaborate a little bit,

80
00:06:42,405 --> 00:06:44,306
if pressing a button doesn't cause an immediate action,

81
00:06:57,053 --> 00:06:59,615
then the player will become frustrated while playing.

82
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:02,238
And if playing is frustrating,

83
00:07:02,278 --> 00:07:04,079
then it's not going to feel good.

84
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:05,100
It's pretty simple.

85
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:07,402
And if playing is frustrating,

86
00:07:07,582 --> 00:07:09,204
then it's not going to feel good.

87
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:10,665
It's pretty simple.

88
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,422
So if the button response is slow,

89
00:07:22,622 --> 00:07:25,805
it's unlikely that the action will meet our goal of fun

90
00:07:26,065 --> 00:07:27,567
from the moment you first touch it.

91
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:30,950
We kept that in mind as we created Near Automata.

92
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,233
What kind of approaches did we take to accomplish that?

93
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:50,313
We make it so that actions such as dodging and jumping, which feel good and are used very frequently during gameplay, can always be executed at any time, no matter what. You push the button and it delivers right away.

94
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,704
In games where dodging is important, like Bayonetta and NieR Automata,

95
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:14,287
we make sure that there's never a time when you can't dodge or you can't jump

96
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:17,990
from the very beginning of the work on the player character implementation side.

97
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:23,195
So in games where dodging is important, like Bayonetta and NieR Automata,

98
00:08:23,635 --> 00:08:27,719
we make sure that there's never a time when you can't dodge or you can't jump

99
00:08:33,622 --> 00:08:37,364
We actually brought a short clip here, so you can take a look at what I mean.

100
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:06,414
So as you can see here, whether you're standing still, jumping, attacking,

101
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:11,095
no matter what position you're in, if you press the dodge button, it will happen.

102
00:09:24,847 --> 00:09:28,211
However, in the final game, in the final product,

103
00:09:28,631 --> 00:09:32,395
there are certain situations in which you can't dodge,

104
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,877
such as when you're in the middle of taking a hit.

105
00:09:35,398 --> 00:09:37,279
So what we do is we set a flag

106
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:39,341
to prevent dodging in those cases

107
00:09:39,642 --> 00:09:41,924
so the dodge button won't respond at that time.

108
00:09:43,173 --> 00:09:51,556
While we were working on the game, we thought that it would be more enjoyable to play without the game balance.

109
00:09:51,696 --> 00:09:54,637
So we tried to make the game more enjoyable.

110
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:56,437
And there's a good reason for that.

111
00:09:56,517 --> 00:10:00,579
We concluded that from both a visual and game balance perspective,

112
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:05,920
not being able to dodge in these specific circumstances actually felt better.

113
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,703
And the responsiveness to player input isn't just about how quickly the game reacts to the button press,

114
00:10:12,723 --> 00:10:16,446
but we also placed importance on how quickly that action results in the desired effect.

115
00:10:34,828 --> 00:10:40,631
So if the time between when you press the button and that action, you see the result of the action, またプレイしながらイライラしてしまい、

116
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:46,914
and this too results in frustration if it takes too long, 気持ちよくないと感じてしまう要因になることが多いです。

117
00:10:46,954 --> 00:10:51,016
and it ends up being a frequent sort of factor in the action not feeling good. これに関してアプローチとして代表的なものが。

118
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:04,669
So, for a notable example of our approach to this topic, 基本的攻撃判定が出るまでの時間をできるだけ短くするというようなことをしています。

119
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,292
is that we make the time it takes for the basic attack to count as hitting the enemy as short as possible.

120
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,963
YOSHIMASA TANAKA, JAPANESE INTERPRETER

121
00:11:32,503 --> 00:11:37,107
We place importance on both the responsiveness

122
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:39,388
of the attack button, you press it

123
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:41,870
and the attack animation immediately starts,

124
00:11:42,531 --> 00:11:44,272
and on the result of the attack,

125
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:47,214
which happens right away, striking the enemy

126
00:11:47,354 --> 00:11:49,095
without making the player wait.

127
00:11:49,115 --> 00:11:52,658
In Nier Automata, when a player character, 2B,

128
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:54,799
presses the attack button while he's waiting,

129
00:11:56,773 --> 00:12:00,116
And so in NieR Automata, if you press the attack button

130
00:12:00,216 --> 00:12:03,979
while the player character 2B is not performing other actions,

131
00:12:05,481 --> 00:12:10,626
the attack animation comes out and it happens immediately,

132
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:16,551
and the hitbox becomes active.

133
00:12:17,472 --> 00:12:20,234
And the time it takes for this to happen

134
00:12:20,314 --> 00:12:21,736
that you see on screen is

135
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:25,189
In 60 frames, which is approximately 0.16 seconds after pressing the button,

136
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:25,570
the enemy is hit.

137
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,330
I think this is pretty fast.

138
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,391
It's 10 frames out of 60 frames in one second.

139
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:29,632
In numbers, that would be approximately 0.16 seconds after pressing the button.

140
00:12:29,712 --> 00:12:30,653
And I think that's pretty fast.

141
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,407
Of course, this doesn't apply to all attacks.

142
00:12:46,427 --> 00:12:48,328
It's only a matter of time before you get a result,

143
00:12:48,348 --> 00:12:49,810
such as a charge-required attack.

144
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,311
This will improve the balance of the game.

145
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:53,093
But I think it's important to feel good

146
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:54,714
when you touch a normal attack

147
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,255
and you get a result right away.

148
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:10,127
Now, of course, this is only an example,

149
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,691
so not all attacks in the game work this way.

150
00:13:14,112 --> 00:13:17,295
But combining this with attacks that require charging

151
00:13:17,816 --> 00:13:20,399
and those that take time to deliver the effect

152
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,962
or the result, the overall balance of the game

153
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:24,664
improves as it develops.

154
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:29,387
But with the aim of achieving a game that feels good the moment you first touch it,

155
00:13:29,747 --> 00:13:34,911
we feel it's important that the very first normal, the standard attack that you can unleash

156
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:40,235
and unleash to respond to will be delivered quickly.

157
00:13:40,255 --> 00:13:42,476
So to sum up the topic of responsiveness...

158
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:51,650
If you press the button and the action happens as quickly as possible,

159
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,333
you can feel the joy and happiness of the moment you touch it.

160
00:13:56,013 --> 00:13:58,675
So if the game reacts as soon as you press the button,

161
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:03,379
and the desired result of that action also occurs as quickly as possible,

162
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,302
that leads to the game feeling really fun,

163
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:09,304
feeling good from the moment you first touch it.

164
00:14:10,447 --> 00:14:18,909
And then, in other areas of the game design process as well, we refine our game's quality little by little through a repeated process of finding, calling out, pointing out, and then correcting parts that don't feel good.

165
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:47,772
And then the third important topic for creating action that's fun from the moment you first

166
00:14:47,872 --> 00:14:56,677
touch is, again, pretty basic, but iteration over and over.

167
00:14:56,777 --> 00:14:58,999
So fine tuning and adjusting.

168
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:06,594
And I have a few examples to show what I mean here.

169
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,557
First, there's flags.

170
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,379
Not only does the player characters and enemies have flags,

171
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:16,301
but every single individual animation in the game

172
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:17,902
has a set of flags associated with it.

173
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:36,896
KOSEI TOROIKAWA, JAPANESE INTERPRETER And the content of those flags are things

174
00:15:36,997 --> 00:15:42,642
like what you see listed here, but a total of 64 flags were used.

175
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:48,307
KOSEI TOROIKAWA, JAPANESE INTERPRETER So here's an example. This is the tool for

176
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:49,308
setting animation flags.

177
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,893
So you first select a character and can play back the selected animation.

178
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:09,957
And the timeline appears right above the arrow there.

179
00:16:09,977 --> 00:16:15,260
And you can set the flags from the flag list that you see in the black box onto the timeline.

180
00:16:25,143 --> 00:16:28,466
The flag list itself looks like this.

181
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:33,149
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA And I do apologize, we didn't have the resources

182
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:36,931
to bring an English translated version of this, but you're more than welcome to take

183
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:38,992
a picture and perhaps do your own translation for yourselves.

184
00:16:55,945 --> 00:16:57,205
今この瞬間だけ写真撮ってOKです。

185
00:16:58,026 --> 00:16:59,887
Yeah, even Yoko-san is saying,

186
00:16:59,927 --> 00:17:01,568
please go ahead and take pictures right now. ただ適当な名前が付けられたりするものもあるので、 今僕が改めて見てもこれなんだろうというような 裏曲があったりするので、 翻訳してもらってもあまり意味ないかもしれません。

187
00:17:13,594 --> 00:17:21,215
But surprisingly, even for me, it's like these names were kind of made up or labeled at that

188
00:17:21,295 --> 00:17:23,416
time what made sense to us.

189
00:17:23,496 --> 00:17:29,537
So now that I look back at all these labels, not every single one makes sense to me quite

190
00:17:30,837 --> 00:17:31,137
well.

191
00:17:31,277 --> 00:17:35,498
And so if you go ahead and translate, I might not even be able to say, you know, what that

192
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:36,358
meant at that time.

193
00:17:37,198 --> 00:17:38,379
So how do we set these flags on animation?

194
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:42,400
So for example, we're going to take one that says follow, or that you can follow.

195
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,001
And we'll click on the box there, and then set the time frame to which the flag's effect will apply.

196
00:18:04,132 --> 00:18:09,935
With this tool, we can set the flag to apply the animation starting from a certain frame and ending on a certain frame,

197
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:12,836
or to have it stay turned on permanently starting from a certain frame.

198
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:36,155
今設定方法でお伝えしたこの追尾可能というフラグも気持ちいいアクションを作る上で重要なものになるので少しだけ内容を説明させていただきます。 So there's a reason why I picked this flag because I want to use this as an example. It's an important one for making action that feels good and I want to talk a little bit about it. 追尾可能というフラグはその名の通りターゲットを追尾するかしないかを設定するフラグです。

199
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:54,971
So this one, I know exactly what it means,

200
00:18:55,272 --> 00:18:56,452
and I'm not confused here.

201
00:18:56,952 --> 00:19:00,514
Just like it sounds, it means that I can set the flag

202
00:19:00,554 --> 00:19:03,836
to follow an enemy or a target.

203
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,077
When the enemy is within a certain range,

204
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:07,237
if this flag is on,

205
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:10,599
the player character will always be facing the direction of the enemy.

206
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:17,214
So what it does is, if animation plays with this flag turned on,

207
00:19:17,634 --> 00:19:20,475
and an enemy is present within a certain range,

208
00:19:20,895 --> 00:19:24,356
the player character will turn their body to face the enemy.

209
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:28,838
And as for how the flag is used,

210
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:31,679
And as for how the flag is used,

211
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,340
the player character will turn their body to face the enemy.

212
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:44,119
So by turning it on for just a little bit at the very beginning

213
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:46,801
of an attack animation, the player character

214
00:19:46,841 --> 00:19:50,344
will always turn to face the enemy when attacking.

215
00:19:50,364 --> 00:19:52,646
In other words, even if you don't aim at the enemy accurately,

216
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,187
just by pressing a button appropriately,

217
00:19:54,247 --> 00:19:56,089
it will be easier to hit the enemy.

218
00:19:56,149 --> 00:19:58,230
This is a flag that improves the comfort of the play.

219
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:02,667
So in other words, even without perfectly aiming at the enemy,

220
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:06,449
you can still hit with your attack just by pressing the button.

221
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:09,510
The flag improves the feel of the gameplay,

222
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:14,152
and we find it important for achieving our goal of immediate fun.

223
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:18,213
This is also very important to make the player feel that it's fun to touch.

224
00:20:18,414 --> 00:20:20,654
Yes, very important to achieving that goal

225
00:20:20,815 --> 00:20:23,295
and to have that instant sort of gratification.

226
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:26,537
If the time the flag is on is too short, it's hard for the enemy to hit you.

227
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:33,987
And, oh, sorry, and then if, sorry about that,

228
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:37,051
if the flag on duration is too short,

229
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:38,913
it's hard to hit the enemy.

230
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:41,557
If the duration is too long,

231
00:20:41,577 --> 00:20:42,979
it's hard to hit the enemy,

232
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,621
and if the duration is too long,

233
00:20:44,681 --> 00:20:45,722
it's hard to hit the enemy,

234
00:20:45,782 --> 00:20:47,124
and if the duration is too long,

235
00:20:47,938 --> 00:20:50,239
But on the opposite, if it's too long,

236
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:52,600
while it does make it easier to hit the enemy,

237
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,201
no matter how they're moving,

238
00:20:54,741 --> 00:20:57,983
it makes your movement look unnatural, a little sluggish,

239
00:20:58,143 --> 00:20:59,904
losing that feel-good feel.

240
00:20:59,924 --> 00:21:03,606
In addition, each animation of the Baudai

241
00:21:03,626 --> 00:21:05,246
does not automatically set the flag

242
00:21:05,286 --> 00:21:07,307
so that the movement and the angle are different.

243
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:08,828
We find a way to set them up

244
00:21:08,848 --> 00:21:09,689
by hand and set them up.

245
00:21:12,342 --> 00:21:15,965
So this is not a small sort of chunk of work here.

246
00:21:15,985 --> 00:21:18,566
There's a massive volume of animation in the game.

247
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:22,989
And each individual one has its own movement and length.

248
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,972
So we were unable to automate this whole process

249
00:21:27,012 --> 00:21:28,052
of setting the flags.

250
00:21:28,713 --> 00:21:32,035
I did it all manually, experimenting

251
00:21:32,175 --> 00:21:35,137
to find what settings matched each of the animations.

252
00:21:35,157 --> 00:21:37,058
SPEAKER 1 IN JAPANESE

253
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:44,589
It does take a very, very long time,

254
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:48,691
and it depends heavily on the sense of the person performing that work.

255
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:51,553
In addition to the flags,

256
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:53,715
the game designer also fine-tunes the animation speed.

257
00:21:53,735 --> 00:21:54,916
Besides the flags and Nier Automata,

258
00:21:54,936 --> 00:21:56,517
the game designer also fine-tunes the animation speed.

259
00:22:04,843 --> 00:22:09,175
We are adjusting the animation by setting the number of frames and the ratio of speed.

260
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:15,289
So as with the flags, we use a tool function

261
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:17,811
to set frame count and playback speed

262
00:22:17,891 --> 00:22:19,532
to fine tune the animation.

263
00:22:19,552 --> 00:22:22,674
Even if the animation designer creates a cool animation,

264
00:22:22,714 --> 00:22:24,736
when we actually move it in the game,

265
00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:27,418
we often disagree with the game designer's wish

266
00:22:27,438 --> 00:22:31,421
to make it a little faster or a little slower,

267
00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:32,321
so we adjust it here

268
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:34,243
after confirming the finished animation.

269
00:22:38,543 --> 00:22:42,466
So no matter how awesome the motion of the animation

270
00:22:42,506 --> 00:22:46,049
designer has created for us, when we actually

271
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:48,891
see it in motion, we might find that it

272
00:22:48,931 --> 00:22:51,293
needs to be adjusted a little bit,

273
00:22:51,654 --> 00:22:54,116
or feel that the move is powerful,

274
00:22:54,236 --> 00:22:56,117
so it should take longer to come out.

275
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,760
There are all these little fine-tuning adjustments

276
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,642
that we feel is needed.

277
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:04,164
It's very common for the animation

278
00:23:04,204 --> 00:23:07,807
to not quite line up with my vision, the game designer's

279
00:23:07,867 --> 00:23:08,127
vision.

280
00:23:08,705 --> 00:23:14,809
So after an animation is created, we will go back in and check it and adjust it ourselves.

281
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:25,716
After we made the adjustments, the animation designer will make the adjustments to the animation.

282
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:29,238
And once we've made the adjustments on the designer side,

283
00:23:29,678 --> 00:23:35,502
the animation designer will make those, implement it, and to match the speed that we set.

284
00:23:36,002 --> 00:23:38,304
And that cycle just continues to repeat.

285
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:49,655
INTERPRETER 2 However, by making adjustments myself rather

286
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:56,478
than issuing or asking them to make these adjustments based on my verbal sort of requests,

287
00:23:56,858 --> 00:24:02,881
the time required for fine tuning is actually shortened and the process is reduced and it's

288
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:04,482
a lot more effective that way.

289
00:24:04,502 --> 00:24:07,163
So now I'd like to summarize my requests for adjustments.

290
00:24:07,852 --> 00:24:10,234
So to sum up the fine-tuning process,

291
00:24:11,335 --> 00:24:16,759
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA, SPEAKING JAPANESE

292
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:23,325
we use our internal software tool to apply flags and speed settings to the animation

293
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:25,287
to make it feel good to play.

294
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:29,911
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA, SPEAKING JAPANESE

295
00:24:30,191 --> 00:24:32,773
and immediately test that within the game itself.

296
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,641
This cycle repeats for eternity.

297
00:24:38,521 --> 00:24:44,844
And we repeat this cycle for what it seems like eternity, like it's not going to ever, ever end.

298
00:24:46,024 --> 00:24:49,506
Even if you set it up once, you may feel that it's not pleasant to touch it after a while.

299
00:24:49,526 --> 00:24:51,587
So we will continue to check it until it's completed.

300
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:59,488
And it's something that we thought we had gotten right,

301
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:02,873
may not feel good after some time has passed

302
00:25:02,953 --> 00:25:04,134
or some days have passed.

303
00:25:04,194 --> 00:25:08,420
So this process is truly a repeated cycle

304
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,163
of adjusting and testing nonstop

305
00:25:11,283 --> 00:25:13,586
until the game is really locked and complete.

306
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:15,145
Speaking Japanese

307
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:29,535
And as I said earlier, because none of this can be automated,

308
00:25:30,336 --> 00:25:34,599
it's a very tedious, challenging process.

309
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:37,981
But I share the opinion that whether or not

310
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:43,165
you can effectively perform this, so not so glamorous,

311
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:48,088
not so fun task, is what makes the difference on how

312
00:25:48,128 --> 00:25:52,191
you can make the game feel good, resulting in the action

313
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:53,732
that you want to see in the game.

314
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:58,558
So to sum up, these are the things we consider very important to achieve our goal of action

315
00:25:58,578 --> 00:26:00,598
that feels good from the moment you first touch it.

316
00:26:00,618 --> 00:26:03,339
With the limited time we have today, I can only go into a very sort of general, broad

317
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:04,599
overview, but to reiterate.

318
00:26:22,805 --> 00:26:24,306
Create a very clear plan for what feels good.

319
00:26:24,346 --> 00:26:27,747
And precisely identify the good and the bad and perform a very careful fine-tuning cycle.

320
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:50,808
But it's also important to remember that there's no absolute correct answer to be found in the process of making this game.

321
00:26:50,828 --> 00:26:54,291
And so that's exactly why it's important to have a very clear vision or plan from the very beginning.

322
00:27:12,739 --> 00:27:17,622
That's all I have for today. Thank you for listening.

323
00:27:18,143 --> 00:27:20,584
And that wraps it up for my section of the talk.

324
00:27:23,126 --> 00:27:24,547
I'm going to hand it over to Yoko.

325
00:27:25,508 --> 00:27:36,115
It's harder to talk than you think, so I'll have to sit down and talk.

326
00:27:42,868 --> 00:27:49,212
It's actually not that easy for me to talk in this position, so I'd rather sit down if

327
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:50,292
that's okay with you guys.

328
00:27:54,371 --> 00:27:55,192
I'll start.

329
00:27:55,252 --> 00:27:55,872
Ms. Squeeny is sitting there,

330
00:27:55,892 --> 00:27:57,573
and she's running out of time, so I'll speak really fast.

331
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,434
So I'm going to start my session now, or part of the session.

332
00:27:59,454 --> 00:28:01,416
The Square Enix staff who's sitting in the front row

333
00:28:01,436 --> 00:28:05,739
have told me that I need to talk at maybe 100 miles per hour to get through it, so here I go.

334
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:27,549
My name is Yoko Taro, or Taro Yoko, and here are some of the games I've worked on.

335
00:28:28,389 --> 00:28:30,769
And this is the theme for today.

336
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:32,230
So, what is freedom?

337
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:37,451
In more detail, I'd like to talk about what freedom is in games,

338
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:40,571
which I've been thinking about while making the latest NINJA AUTOMATIC.

339
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:45,887
OK, maybe that's not fair.

340
00:28:45,987 --> 00:28:48,609
So a little bit more about what I'm going to talk about today

341
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:51,811
is what is freedom as we thought of it

342
00:28:51,951 --> 00:28:55,614
within the context of creating our title, Near Automata?

343
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:57,455
I'm sorry if I didn't meet your expectations

344
00:28:57,475 --> 00:28:58,035
on how to create a scenario.

345
00:28:58,055 --> 00:28:59,416
But I think I've mentioned it somewhere in the past in GDC,

346
00:28:59,436 --> 00:29:00,797
so please do your best to search for it.

347
00:29:06,297 --> 00:29:08,037
He's talking really fast, as you can tell.

348
00:29:09,657 --> 00:29:12,178
There might be some people today in the audience who

349
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:15,439
came here expecting to hear about a scenario creation

350
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:16,319
sort of process.

351
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:19,340
I apologize that I may disappoint you today.

352
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,961
That said, I've done presentations here at GDC

353
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:24,521
in the past about that process.

354
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:27,222
So maybe you could search, look it up on YouTube,

355
00:29:27,482 --> 00:29:30,883
and listen to that subject or topic later.

356
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:32,803
SPEAKER 1 IN JAPANESE

357
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,302
So I'd like to bring it back to the topic of freedom.

358
00:29:37,764 --> 00:29:40,267
When you say freedom, you probably think of an open world game.

359
00:29:40,287 --> 00:29:41,488
You might call it sandbox or free roaming.

360
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:43,751
But roughly speaking, you can do a lot of things on a large map.

361
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:46,395
I'm sure you all know what I'm talking about, but I'll explain it.

362
00:29:52,659 --> 00:29:55,821
So when you think of games that offer a high degree of freedom,

363
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:57,523
the first thing that usually comes to mind

364
00:29:57,583 --> 00:29:58,664
are open world games.

365
00:29:59,024 --> 00:30:02,167
They can also be called sandbox games or free roaming games.

366
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,729
But to give a rough explanation of what that entails,

367
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:08,432
it means there's a large map and there's so much stuff to do.

368
00:30:08,813 --> 00:30:09,954
Something like that, probably.

369
00:30:10,274 --> 00:30:12,776
But regardless, I'm sure everyone listening to this

370
00:30:12,856 --> 00:30:13,657
knows that already.

371
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:15,398
English is much better.

372
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:16,699
Thank you.

373
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:22,164
So if we were to look at the structure of NieR and NieR Automata, two games that I worked on,

374
00:30:22,184 --> 00:30:25,086
it wouldn't be technically incorrect to refer to them as open world games.

375
00:30:35,185 --> 00:30:36,065
Speaking in Japanese

376
00:30:52,557 --> 00:30:54,538
So, well, I'm going to be honest here.

377
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:57,100
If we look at the structure for Nier's game map,

378
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,422
it's something that I basically stole from The Legend of Zelda,

379
00:31:00,582 --> 00:31:01,442
Ocarina of Time.

380
00:31:02,683 --> 00:31:03,403
I just said it.

381
00:31:03,884 --> 00:31:06,405
It's built in the exact same way, with planes in the center

382
00:31:06,545 --> 00:31:08,026
and distinct areas surrounding it.

383
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:09,567
Even if the size of the planes, it's

384
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,848
to the point where you might think I used a stopwatch

385
00:31:11,888 --> 00:31:14,970
to time it, how long it took to cross the planes in Ocarina

386
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,651
of Time, and copied it down to the second.

387
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,433
Well, I suppose it wouldn't be incorrect to call Ocarina of Time...

388
00:31:35,848 --> 00:31:41,509
an open world as well. But I think it's actually more of a perfectly straight sort of road and path

389
00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:47,751
that you can go back and forth as much as you want. In that sense, and since Nier copied that,

390
00:31:48,271 --> 00:31:54,172
it actually has extremely little freedom when compared to the kinds of open world games that we have now.

391
00:31:54,192 --> 00:31:58,353
Speaking of which, there was a word in Japan recently that was used,

392
00:31:58,433 --> 00:31:59,433
and that was the word, open world zukare.

393
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:02,014
I think that was a particularly prevalent trend in Western countries

394
00:32:02,034 --> 00:32:03,474
after the release of the first game, Open World.

395
00:32:05,178 --> 00:32:08,379
So a short while back, there was this term that people were discussing.

396
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:11,200
Even in Japan, it was open-world fatigue.

397
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,281
I think this phenomenon was especially prominent in the West,

398
00:32:14,341 --> 00:32:17,902
where there was a sustained string of major open-world game releases,

399
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:18,883
one after another.

400
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:23,884
As a feature of the open-world strategy developed by the pioneer

401
00:32:24,045 --> 00:32:25,645
of GTA, Skyrim, and Just Cause,

402
00:32:25,705 --> 00:32:28,286
as you can see, there are vast maps, a lot of items,

403
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:29,286
and a lot of quests.

404
00:32:29,306 --> 00:32:32,588
There are also a lot of other crafting and training elements.

405
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:36,531
There are a lot of games that don't have enough playtime even if you have 100 hours.

406
00:33:03,897 --> 00:33:06,419
So, this genre that was carved out by all these pioneers, it felt so fresh and so new at first,

407
00:33:06,579 --> 00:33:09,001
but as a result of putting out tons of these, one after another...

408
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:11,523
...those elements were said to be too much and too tiring.

409
00:33:35,085 --> 00:33:39,385
And now people are starting to say that not only are they tired of elements like these,

410
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:43,006
but there are entirely too many of these elements to begin with.

411
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:44,966
So then why did this happen?

412
00:33:45,046 --> 00:33:48,047
How do we end up in this very contradictory situation

413
00:33:48,107 --> 00:33:52,368
where people have started to complain about having a high level of freedom,

414
00:33:52,968 --> 00:33:56,708
even though a high level of freedom is supposed to be what they were expecting?

415
00:33:58,423 --> 00:34:03,707
It's because we took the vastness of the map, a lot of items, a lot of quests for granted,

416
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:04,988
and started to think of them as work.

417
00:34:05,508 --> 00:34:11,433
So I think our conclusion, at least in my opinion, is that because things like enormous maps and lots of items,

418
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:17,658
tons of things to do, once they became ordinary, people started to think of them as just simple chores.

419
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,541
Being free doesn't mean you feel free.

420
00:34:21,681 --> 00:34:23,802
This is a phenomenon unique to games.

421
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:29,945
And I think it's fair to say that a state of high level of freedom,

422
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:36,327
not being directly connected, or does not equate to the actual sensation of feeling free,

423
00:34:36,768 --> 00:34:38,868
and that is very unique to games.

424
00:34:40,189 --> 00:34:42,850
I think the creators really want players to play freely,

425
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,451
so they have prepared a lot of content,

426
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:45,731
but in the end, for the players,

427
00:34:45,852 --> 00:34:47,492
it feels like a duty to spend all the quests,

428
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:49,453
or else it will feel like a loss.

429
00:34:50,677 --> 00:34:56,859
So game creators like ourselves, we work and work and prepare an enormous amount,

430
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:02,281
a number of quests and content because we think that that's what players want to play and freely

431
00:35:02,421 --> 00:35:06,902
sort of play. But the end result of that is that the player feeling like they need to get through

432
00:35:07,082 --> 00:35:11,623
every single quest because they feel like they're going to be missing out on something,

433
00:35:12,764 --> 00:35:16,325
is transformed into kind of an obligation.

434
00:35:17,203 --> 00:35:19,685
So how do we go about fixing this problem that's happening?

435
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:20,705
I took some hints from other games.

436
00:35:28,644 --> 00:35:29,984
This is the Super Mario screen.

437
00:35:30,364 --> 00:35:34,766
When I was playing the game, I happened to move to the top of the score.

438
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,026
This is the picture on the left.

439
00:35:37,446 --> 00:35:40,067
So we're going to go way back in time here, as you can see.

440
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:43,448
So Super Mario Brothers is one example.

441
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:47,108
I was able to move my character all the way up to the top of the map

442
00:35:47,148 --> 00:35:50,289
where the score is positioned, and that's what we see on the left here.

443
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:53,330
You can move to a different area like the one on the right.

444
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:55,270
The top of the score is a hidden passage.

445
00:35:58,357 --> 00:36:01,680
And from there, I was able to warp to a different area,

446
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,183
as you see on the right screen.

447
00:36:04,323 --> 00:36:06,445
The very top, the place where the score was,

448
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:08,347
was actually a hidden passageway.

449
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:10,509
I was very surprised when I saw this.

450
00:36:10,529 --> 00:36:12,831
Because I learned that a vast world was embedded in this game

451
00:36:12,851 --> 00:36:14,713
by breaking the framework of the world I had been thinking about.

452
00:36:17,972 --> 00:36:21,252
I was absolutely shocked. I was like, what is going on here?

453
00:36:21,272 --> 00:36:26,634
I was seeing that smash the entire idea about how the world was framed

454
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:30,555
and made me feel as though this game contained an enormous world.

455
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:35,716
So here's another example, a screenshot from GTA 4.

456
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:38,897
So here's another example, a screenshot from GTA 4.

457
00:36:39,017 --> 00:36:41,977
I was surprised by one thing while playing this game.

458
00:36:42,017 --> 00:36:44,018
The people in the city couldn't talk to the NPCs.

459
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,365
In many Japanese RPGs, NPCs like this are usually able to have conversations,

460
00:36:50,386 --> 00:36:54,755
but I couldn't imagine that a game with a big budget like GTA would miss out on such implementation.

461
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:01,223
So here's one thing that surprised me when I was playing this game.

462
00:37:01,383 --> 00:37:04,344
You can't actually talk to the NPCs in the city.

463
00:37:04,364 --> 00:37:10,926
NPCs like having dialogue on their own as a matter of course in most JRPGs.

464
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:15,648
And I can't think that a game with an enormous budget like the GTA series

465
00:37:15,728 --> 00:37:18,108
would have shirked implementing something like that.

466
00:37:19,198 --> 00:37:19,298
But

467
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,141
I had an aha moment, and maybe you guys did too.

468
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:49,482
If you stop to think about it, it actually does make sense.

469
00:37:49,562 --> 00:37:52,464
Because in the real world, I don't know about you guys,

470
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:56,305
but I don't think we go around town just talking

471
00:37:56,325 --> 00:37:57,526
to strangers all the time.

472
00:37:57,606 --> 00:38:01,688
So in that sense, since GTA is imitating the real world,

473
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:04,309
not being able to talk to most NPCs

474
00:38:04,549 --> 00:38:06,670
actually creates that sense of realism.

475
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,672
In the game, even if you could freely soar through the skies,

476
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:11,292
run out.

477
00:38:13,653 --> 00:38:18,675
500, 600, 700 kilometers per hour, or pass through anything in the world at will,

478
00:38:18,735 --> 00:38:20,756
that's not going to make you feel free.

479
00:38:20,776 --> 00:38:24,177
What we know from Super Mario and Grand Theft Auto is that

480
00:38:24,197 --> 00:38:26,078
being free is the key to feeling free.

481
00:38:30,045 --> 00:38:34,587
So from just these two examples from Super Mario Brothers and GTA,

482
00:38:34,987 --> 00:38:38,328
in order to make someone feel a sense of freedom,

483
00:38:38,948 --> 00:38:41,769
we need a frame that inhibits freedom,

484
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:46,031
and that is key to making that world happen.

485
00:38:46,051 --> 00:38:49,452
So let's say this is our world,

486
00:38:49,492 --> 00:38:52,633
and you are free to go anywhere within this circle.

487
00:39:04,905 --> 00:39:14,729
So at this point, what's important is not the size of the circle here, but rather the circumference, the circle, the frame, the gray frame that you see around it.

488
00:39:14,749 --> 00:39:23,633
This frame is the limit of what the player thinks the world is. The moment you push the frame of your imagination, you feel free.

489
00:39:24,758 --> 00:39:29,540
So this frame is what the player believes to be what the limit is, or the scope of the world,

490
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:35,223
and it's this moment that we expand what this frame has been perceived

491
00:39:36,403 --> 00:39:40,085
to be that people feel a sense of freedom.

492
00:39:40,105 --> 00:39:44,567
To perceive what freedom is, it's important to have this moment

493
00:39:44,587 --> 00:39:45,827
when the frame of imagination expands.

494
00:39:47,725 --> 00:39:54,169
So in order to foster this idea of freedom, what's important is the moment when, as you see here,

495
00:39:54,610 --> 00:40:00,694
just two simple sort of circles, that your perceived framework of the world suddenly expands.

496
00:40:01,495 --> 00:40:04,717
When you get in a car that you didn't expect to be able to drive,

497
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:08,440
or when you get into an object that you didn't expect to be able to break,

498
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,682
you feel the freedom of the player in that moment,

499
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:13,323
and that part of not expecting it is very important.

500
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:18,233
So in a game, let's say a player rides a vehicle that they didn't think they could,

501
00:40:18,813 --> 00:40:22,596
or breaks an object that they think they didn't think they could break.

502
00:40:22,996 --> 00:40:24,417
They say, I didn't think I could do that.

503
00:40:24,677 --> 00:40:29,780
And that's what makes them feel the sense of freedom at that moment.

504
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:34,964
So the most important part here is, oh, I didn't think I could do that, but I could.

505
00:40:34,984 --> 00:40:37,646
So freedom.

506
00:40:43,765 --> 00:40:47,748
is in a future that you did not have in the past.

507
00:40:51,832 --> 00:40:59,137
The reason why it's in bold and it's in large font is because I think that sentence actually sounds really, really cool.

508
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:02,580
I'm not sure if you can hear me.

509
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,142
But if you read it carefully, it's a sentence with no meaning.

510
00:41:05,222 --> 00:41:10,225
What I want to say is that you can feel freedom when you broaden your awareness of what is free,

511
00:41:10,245 --> 00:41:11,887
not when you are in a materialistic state.

512
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:18,123
But the more you think about it, it's actually kind of a hard to understand sort of sentence.

513
00:41:18,263 --> 00:41:23,646
So what I'm trying to say here is to make people feel a sense of freedom,

514
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:31,852
what's important is not volume. Freedom is felt the moment that the perceptions held by the human mind are expanded.

515
00:41:31,872 --> 00:41:34,974
I'm running out of time, but I'll try to speak as fast as I can.

516
00:41:38,554 --> 00:41:42,777
Okay, so I'm going to go even faster because I need to cover a little bit more.

517
00:41:48,702 --> 00:41:53,325
So to speak more on the idea of expanding that perception held in our mind,

518
00:41:53,425 --> 00:41:55,047
I'd like to explain a case from Nier.

519
00:41:56,408 --> 00:41:59,310
As I mentioned earlier, there is a limit to what you can do in the world.

520
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,852
It is important to create the outside of that limit.

521
00:42:03,461 --> 00:42:07,744
So like I said before, the world has a framework that shows that indicates its limits.

522
00:42:07,824 --> 00:42:10,346
What's important is creating what's outside of this world.

523
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:15,570
But Nier is not a AAA class title, so we can't just cost it to expand the world.

524
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:18,312
So this is how we came up with the idea.

525
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:21,975
That said, Nier is not a AAA class project.

526
00:42:22,035 --> 00:42:25,758
We don't have that budget to go left and right and expand the world.

527
00:42:25,878 --> 00:42:27,699
So this is the approach we took.

528
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:31,268
Went smaller.

529
00:42:32,589 --> 00:42:40,152
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA I'm thinking.

530
00:42:40,172 --> 00:42:41,193
I went smaller.

531
00:42:41,593 --> 00:42:43,233
So I created an additional framework

532
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,854
inside the limits of the world.

533
00:42:44,954 --> 00:42:47,575
And by doing this, I wanted to have players experience

534
00:42:47,595 --> 00:42:49,756
the moment the world's framework expands.

535
00:42:50,557 --> 00:42:52,137
YUSUKE USTUNOMIYA And to make this happen,

536
00:42:52,157 --> 00:42:53,658
I did a planning that looks like this.

537
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:03,620
I emphasize the inner framework, not the outer, preventing them from recognizing

538
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,822
that the world that would appear later on. It's necessary to make the player incorrectly

539
00:43:06,842 --> 00:43:09,364
assume that this inner framework is where the edge of the world is.

540
00:43:28,737 --> 00:43:32,960
And I'll use a specific example from the game so that it makes more sense.

541
00:43:34,921 --> 00:43:41,644
So broadly speaking, the original Nier scenario is structured in this manner.

542
00:43:42,505 --> 00:43:45,927
The premise is that Nier is a structure that allows you to collect the same map three times.

543
00:43:45,947 --> 00:43:50,069
This is because we didn't have the budget to make a big map and had to use it three times.

544
00:43:51,315 --> 00:43:56,699
So for starters, Nier is structured such that players will go around the same map three times.

545
00:43:56,879 --> 00:44:00,541
The reason is simple. We did not have the budget to make a large map.

546
00:44:01,882 --> 00:44:05,704
In the scenario, we first show the youth on the same map.

547
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:07,965
Then we watch the ending A.

548
00:44:08,706 --> 00:44:12,768
So as far as the scenario is laid out, you first present the characters' life as a child,

549
00:44:12,868 --> 00:44:14,989
and then you present them as a youth on the same map.

550
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:16,951
And when that's done, you watch ending A.

551
00:44:18,267 --> 00:44:25,411
There may be some of you who know this, but the fact that you can play both the boy and the girl on the same map is a copy of the Legend of Zelda and the Ocarina of Time.

552
00:44:25,911 --> 00:44:29,914
And of course, that's also a copy of Ocarina of Time.

553
00:44:29,934 --> 00:44:34,996
After you see the end of the game, you can only play the boy's part again.

554
00:44:35,016 --> 00:44:37,337
But here, you can hear the enemy's voice, which is a new element.

555
00:44:37,357 --> 00:44:40,719
There's a reason why you can attack the enemy you thought was a bad guy.

556
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:45,697
This is a story that is like a back-end.

557
00:44:45,797 --> 00:44:49,701
If you clear the back-end, you can see the B-end, which is a different ending.

558
00:44:51,785 --> 00:44:58,169
So after watching ending A, it's then possible to replay just a section of the time when the character is older.

559
00:44:58,770 --> 00:45:03,313
But that's when a new element comes into play. Now you can hear the enemies' voices.

560
00:45:04,094 --> 00:45:10,058
There's a reason why you're being attacked by these enemies you had previously thought as very vicious.

561
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:14,061
It was as though we were telling a story with a flipside to it.

562
00:45:14,581 --> 00:45:19,725
So completing this flipside of the story would then let you see a different ending, which is ending B.

563
00:45:22,085 --> 00:45:24,329
In general, RPGs have one story, so the ending is one too.

564
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:26,713
In the previous game, Nier, by showing the A-end once,

565
00:45:26,733 --> 00:45:30,419
we made the game end there, as if it was the limit of the world,

566
00:45:30,499 --> 00:45:32,943
and then we showed the back route, so you could feel the world's expansion.

567
00:45:37,115 --> 00:45:41,157
So your typical RPG usually has one route through the entire story

568
00:45:41,237 --> 00:45:42,878
and then put broadly just one ending.

569
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:46,039
In Nier, by showing players ending A,

570
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,160
you give them a false impression that the game is over.

571
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:52,162
Or in other words, that they've seen the limits of what the world has to offer.

572
00:45:52,322 --> 00:45:55,483
But then, by presenting them with the flip side through the story,

573
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,885
I was hoping to have them feel as though the world has expanded.

574
00:45:59,625 --> 00:46:02,446
So then with that in mind, how should we go about structuring Nier Automata?

575
00:46:03,147 --> 00:46:06,808
So then with that in mind, how should we go about structuring Nier Automata?

576
00:46:07,305 --> 00:46:07,845
the sequel.

577
00:46:08,626 --> 00:46:10,127
In the development of Automata,

578
00:46:10,207 --> 00:46:13,410
Nier has been recognized as a game with a hidden story.

579
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:15,852
So, even if we do the same thing, we won't be surprised.

580
00:46:15,872 --> 00:46:18,955
That's why we took the following structure in Automata.

581
00:46:19,355 --> 00:46:21,477
So, by the time we were working on Automata,

582
00:46:21,537 --> 00:46:25,260
there was already, everyone knew that Nier is a game that has these flip sides.

583
00:46:25,901 --> 00:46:28,203
So, I decided to make Automata a game

584
00:46:28,643 --> 00:46:31,025
with a story structured in the following manner.

585
00:46:31,045 --> 00:46:34,888
First, it's the same as using the map three times.

586
00:46:35,745 --> 00:46:38,567
One thing remains unchanged, we're still reusing the map.

587
00:46:39,747 --> 00:46:40,368
Three times.

588
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:44,870
Unlike the previous game, we're showing the ending as soon as the girl's version is shown.

589
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:47,411
Next, we're playing the same route as the boy's version.

590
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:50,873
This is the same structure as the previous game's back route,

591
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,514
and has the ability to show the true form of the world.

592
00:46:55,362 --> 00:46:59,004
However, unlike the first Nier, we presented the arc of the game,

593
00:46:59,044 --> 00:47:03,207
where you play as a girl first and then show ending A right away.

594
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:05,368
Next, we go through the same route again,

595
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:07,270
but instead of having you play as a boy,

596
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:11,172
this serves as the same function as it did in the previous game,

597
00:47:11,252 --> 00:47:14,895
being a flip side that shows the world for what it truly is.

598
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,958
And then we show ending B at the time when the boy's story is over.

599
00:47:25,824 --> 00:47:29,225
And then after ending B, we then show an entirely new chapter that tells a story for leading up to ending C.

600
00:47:29,245 --> 00:47:30,045
And the reason why we did that is...

601
00:47:30,065 --> 00:47:32,166
At the end of B, the player gets the feeling that it's over.

602
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:58,081
To have, once players have reached ending B, we make them feel as though the game is over.

603
00:47:59,242 --> 00:48:02,744
For the fans of the previous game, there is a perception that there is a hidden route,

604
00:48:02,784 --> 00:48:05,725
so we play while imagining that the game will end on that hidden route.

605
00:48:05,745 --> 00:48:09,347
To break that imagination, by presenting the feeling that there is a further hidden route,

606
00:48:09,367 --> 00:48:11,388
we aim to make them feel the expansion of the new world.

607
00:48:14,748 --> 00:48:18,810
So fans of the Prius game, they know that there's another route to the game.

608
00:48:18,890 --> 00:48:22,611
So they will be playing the game with the assumption that it will end once they have

609
00:48:22,671 --> 00:48:24,012
finished this alternate route.

610
00:48:24,792 --> 00:48:29,995
We counter that assumption by presenting them with an experience where there is still more

611
00:48:30,075 --> 00:48:36,037
waiting for them at the end of the alternate route when that's over, giving them that experience

612
00:48:36,057 --> 00:48:37,438
of a new world opening up.

613
00:48:37,558 --> 00:48:38,338
That was our goal.

614
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:49,782
I was going to go into another example, but seeing that we're running out of time, I'm going to have to skip that now.

615
00:48:50,522 --> 00:49:00,646
One page, two pages, three pages, four pages.

616
00:49:01,766 --> 00:49:05,027
We don't need to talk, I guess. You guys understand the content of this speech.

617
00:49:06,188 --> 00:49:07,288
Let's move on to the last topic.

618
00:49:09,595 --> 00:49:13,617
Okay, so this is the last topic I definitely wanted to talk about today.

619
00:49:13,637 --> 00:49:16,880
This is the final part of the game.

620
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:21,182
We have a message of support from the world to players struggling in the final battle.

621
00:49:21,903 --> 00:49:25,205
As you all probably know, this is a screenshot from the game's final section.

622
00:49:25,305 --> 00:49:27,687
Messages of encouragement from across the world

623
00:49:28,687 --> 00:49:31,289
for players who are struggling with the game's final battle.

624
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:35,738
This message of support can be entered by clearing the last battle.

625
00:49:35,818 --> 00:49:39,680
In other words, it's a loop where the person who was supported

626
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,801
will support the next person.

627
00:49:41,181 --> 00:49:44,103
So, as you know, you can leave these messages of encouragement

628
00:49:44,243 --> 00:49:45,723
once you have finished the game yourself.

629
00:49:45,784 --> 00:49:49,806
This creates a really cool loop where people who were encouraged by others

630
00:49:50,286 --> 00:49:52,828
then go on to encourage others right back.

631
00:49:53,668 --> 00:49:54,929
I've talked about this for a long time,

632
00:49:54,969 --> 00:49:56,770
but I'd like to talk about what I want to tell you today.

633
00:49:58,553 --> 00:50:03,036
Finally, I'm at a point where I can talk about what I've been wanting to talk about all day today.

634
00:50:03,096 --> 00:50:04,117
I know it took a little while.

635
00:50:04,137 --> 00:50:07,299
The truth is, this genius idea is not mine. I stole this one, too.

636
00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:09,401
It's from a campaign called the Coca-Cola Small World Machines.

637
00:50:21,904 --> 00:50:26,486
I mentioned this in my previous GDC talk, but Coca-Cola is a social experiment project

638
00:50:26,506 --> 00:50:28,726
that was conducted in India and Pakistan.

639
00:50:29,467 --> 00:50:32,888
So I don't know if any of you were at my previous GDC session,

640
00:50:33,328 --> 00:50:39,750
but this is a campaign that Coca-Cola deployed between two countries that are on bad terms.

641
00:50:42,031 --> 00:50:46,913
The project is about encouraging people in the bad countries to understand each other.

642
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:50,294
It's hard to explain, so if you're interested, please look it up on YouTube.

643
00:50:50,855 --> 00:50:55,917
Right. It's a story between how can people still, human beings, still get along

644
00:50:56,317 --> 00:51:02,419
even though they may have disagreements on their situation, the country's situation, and society.

645
00:51:02,479 --> 00:51:06,140
But if I talk about it, it's a little too long, so please look it up on YouTube.

646
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:11,501
But because it is something that I was very deeply sort of inspired and influenced by.

647
00:51:12,205 --> 00:51:13,746
I was very impressed by the project.

648
00:51:13,766 --> 00:51:16,987
When I look at the real world, it is full of elephants.

649
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:18,587
People are able to hate each other.

650
00:51:18,768 --> 00:51:21,809
The Coca-Cola project was a very innovative attempt to solve that.

651
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:30,193
That project left an extremely strong impression on me.

652
00:51:30,233 --> 00:51:35,756
You don't have to look very hard in this today real world sort of society

653
00:51:35,817 --> 00:51:37,658
to see that it's overflowing with hatred.

654
00:51:37,758 --> 00:51:44,062
We are capable of just easily detesting people that we have never met or seen or heard of before.

655
00:51:44,243 --> 00:51:47,925
And so I was really impressed by this project and what it was trying to do.

656
00:51:47,945 --> 00:51:51,488
I saw it and the same way, in NINI and AUTOMATA, the last message,

657
00:51:51,508 --> 00:51:52,388
that is, on this screen,

658
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:55,652
I wanted to use this final message in Near Automata, the screen you see here,

659
00:51:55,672 --> 00:51:57,652
to communicate something. By having people share messages with people from other countries

660
00:51:57,672 --> 00:51:59,473
that they have not so great relationships with, I wanted them to realize that the person

661
00:51:59,493 --> 00:52:01,014
that they're directing hatred towards is also, just like themselves, a gamer.

662
00:52:01,694 --> 00:52:06,256
So just like what Coca-Cola did, I wanted to use this final message in Near Automata,

663
00:52:06,296 --> 00:52:11,178
the screen you see here, to communicate something. By having people share messages

664
00:52:11,198 --> 00:52:14,399
that they're directing hatred towards is also, just like themselves, a gamer.

665
00:52:26,053 --> 00:52:28,134
But I ended up giving up on that.

666
00:52:34,136 --> 00:52:42,620
And the reason for that is because I felt like if I did that, that would be me imposing my own principles onto others, yourselves.

667
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:47,402
So I chose a country and a person randomly and displayed the message of support on the screen.

668
00:52:47,482 --> 00:52:52,024
I think that video games should not be the creators' choice, but rather the players' choice.

669
00:52:54,761 --> 00:52:58,731
I honestly don't know what kind of behavior the players will choose.

670
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,297
That is the freedom I see in this video game.

671
00:53:02,841 --> 00:53:05,602
So what we did instead was make it

672
00:53:05,642 --> 00:53:07,463
so that the screen display messages,

673
00:53:07,843 --> 00:53:10,784
from words of encouragement, from people in countries

674
00:53:10,804 --> 00:53:11,825
selected at random.

675
00:53:12,365 --> 00:53:15,086
I believe video games should allow players the freedom

676
00:53:15,146 --> 00:53:17,187
to make their own decisions and not

677
00:53:17,247 --> 00:53:19,188
have the opinions of our creators,

678
00:53:19,328 --> 00:53:21,229
myself, forced upon them.

679
00:53:21,749 --> 00:53:25,310
I don't know what a player will think when they see this

680
00:53:25,531 --> 00:53:27,812
or what you guys all thought when you saw this.

681
00:53:28,332 --> 00:53:30,753
That's exactly the kind of video game freedom

682
00:53:31,093 --> 00:53:32,253
I wanted to make this time.

683
00:53:33,257 --> 00:53:36,040
But, well, if I can say something about my personal feelings,

684
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,842
I was impressed by the Coca-Cola vending machine.

685
00:53:38,862 --> 00:53:41,084
If even a small number of players

686
00:53:41,124 --> 00:53:42,946
could think of the people of a faraway country,

687
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:43,707
I would be very happy.

688
00:53:43,747 --> 00:53:45,188
I pray for that to happen.

689
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:53,323
Having said that, if I were to have a personal wish or thought of my own,

690
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:56,585
just like I was influenced by the Coca-Cola campaign,

691
00:53:57,105 --> 00:54:01,688
I hope that the people who played this game took the time to think about someone they don't know

692
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:05,131
in a faraway country, even if it's just for a little bit.

693
00:54:05,631 --> 00:54:10,434
That would make me extremely happy, and secretly, that's really what all I hope for.

694
00:54:10,454 --> 00:54:13,737
Thank you for listening, and thank you for coming today.

695
00:54:14,137 --> 00:54:14,537
Thank you.

696
00:54:17,932 --> 00:54:30,496
Thank you. ~~

697
00:54:30,556 --> 00:54:35,677
~~ Normally we would have all you guys come up to the mic and ask some questions. ~~

698
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:50,270
And we don't have any time, five minutes left.

699
00:54:51,953 --> 00:54:52,774
And there's a Q&A.

700
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:54,797
We're so selfish, we brought our own Q&A.

701
00:55:02,141 --> 00:55:06,044
So, Tauro-san, what is it like to develop games at Platinum?

702
00:55:06,585 --> 00:55:09,487
Okay, so yeah, now you can see I'm Yoko on the left,

703
00:55:09,868 --> 00:55:12,970
and Tauro-san on the right.

704
00:55:13,091 --> 00:55:15,172
Oh, sorry, yeah, we're standing opposite.

705
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:19,616
That's not... yeah, during rehearsals, we're standing on the right side.

706
00:55:20,137 --> 00:55:24,320
So, Tauro-san, what is it like to develop games at Platinum?

707
00:55:24,781 --> 00:55:29,004
So, Tauro-san, what is it like to develop games at Platinum?

708
00:55:30,468 --> 00:55:34,889
The goal of everyone at Platinum Games is to actually become a game creator.

709
00:55:34,929 --> 00:55:39,331
I'm sure there's all these different disciplines, art, programming, design and whatnot, and

710
00:55:39,351 --> 00:55:40,592
we have teams of 10, 20, 30 people.

711
00:55:59,399 --> 00:56:03,003
But it's very important to us that we foster an environment

712
00:56:03,043 --> 00:56:05,986
where people aren't required to just stick to what they know

713
00:56:06,486 --> 00:56:09,590
and that they can contribute their ideas and work together.

714
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:14,835
So, turning the question right back at you, Yoko-san.

715
00:56:15,136 --> 00:56:18,159
So, turning the question right back at you, Yoko-san.

716
00:56:20,177 --> 00:56:25,579
It's hard to see you, so a little more.

717
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:27,139
Platinum is very young and passionate.

718
00:56:27,159 --> 00:56:30,200
I thought it was amazing that young people are showing their creativity

719
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,021
when I thought that there was a Kamiya in Bayonetta.

720
00:56:32,041 --> 00:56:33,881
I think you're a rare development artist in Japan.

721
00:56:38,619 --> 00:56:43,081
I was appalled, you know, a very young and passionate group of people at Platinum Games.

722
00:56:43,141 --> 00:56:49,603
It's a place that, you guys know, Kamiya-san, Kamiya Hideki of Bayonetta series is there.

723
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:54,445
So I figured it would be kind of a situation where you have one director, one person leading the pack.

724
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:56,406
But it wasn't really all about that.

725
00:56:56,426 --> 00:57:03,169
There's a lot of young staffers doing a fine job of exhibiting their ideas and creativity, which I thought was amazing.

726
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:08,793
Not just probably in the West, but even more so in Japan.

727
00:57:08,853 --> 00:57:11,415
That's kind of a rare sort of environment that we see.

728
00:57:11,435 --> 00:57:15,298
So my next question to you, what were you particular about creating near Automata?

729
00:57:15,318 --> 00:57:18,020
I was particular about a lot of things, but I'm going to skip ahead because of time.

730
00:57:31,071 --> 00:57:37,256
Oh, okay. We are very particular about a lot of things, but we're running out of time, so I'm going to skip to the next question.

731
00:57:38,157 --> 00:57:40,800
And throwing the question right back at you, Yoko-san.

732
00:57:57,799 --> 00:58:07,044
So this is a near sequel, but I was really attentive to making sure that the people who were newcomers to the series could still ease in,

733
00:58:07,224 --> 00:58:10,226
and it wasn't intimidating for them to get into the series.

734
00:58:21,513 --> 00:58:24,916
When you talk about a long-standing IP or franchise,

735
00:58:24,956 --> 00:58:27,578
there are so many of those that you feel like you can't get

736
00:58:27,978 --> 00:58:31,121
the full enjoyment, the 100% satisfaction,

737
00:58:31,161 --> 00:58:32,843
if you don't know the previous story

738
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:35,245
or the previous iterations of the series.

739
00:58:35,325 --> 00:58:37,246
So I wanted to really avoid that,

740
00:58:37,346 --> 00:58:39,828
and instead doing whatever I could to make sure

741
00:58:39,869 --> 00:58:42,571
that you'd be able to enjoy the game equally,

742
00:58:42,931 --> 00:58:46,054
whether you had previous knowledge of the series or not.

743
00:58:50,948 --> 00:58:54,151
So, Tauro-san, what did you struggle with when creating this game?

744
00:58:54,171 --> 00:58:57,133
RPG was a genre I had no experience with as a Platinum Games.

745
00:58:57,153 --> 00:58:59,175
So, as Platinum Games, we have no experience in creating an RPG.

746
00:58:59,195 --> 00:59:01,838
So, I think that was the most challenging for all of us as a team.

747
00:59:02,698 --> 00:59:08,183
So, as Platinum Games, we have no experience in creating an RPG.

748
00:59:09,404 --> 00:59:12,267
So, I think that was the most challenging for all of us as a team.

749
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:13,520
And yourself?

750
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:15,321
So everyone on staff was incredibly talented.

751
00:59:15,341 --> 00:59:19,825
So as a director, I really didn't struggle at all.

752
00:59:40,956 --> 00:59:46,238
But on the flip side, because everyone was so on top of things and so talented,

753
00:59:46,258 --> 00:59:51,340
I was a little embarrassed that me delivering the scenario was delayed.

754
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:56,722
And, you know, it's a good thing to have talented people and staff around you,

755
00:59:56,802 --> 01:00:02,824
but it's also not the best thing because then my sort of delays and, I guess,

756
01:00:03,144 --> 01:00:05,205
challenges stand out a little bit more.

757
01:00:06,506 --> 01:00:08,387
We still have a lot of Q&A, but we're running out of time,

758
01:00:08,407 --> 01:00:09,628
so I'd like to answer each question one by one.

759
01:00:09,648 --> 01:00:11,310
Taura, please choose one question you'd like to answer.

760
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:11,530
Which one?

761
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:12,671
Why did you include auto mode?

762
01:00:35,568 --> 01:00:38,569
You can skip cutscenes, and we felt like, well, if you can skip cutscenes,

763
01:00:38,589 --> 01:00:40,289
then you should be able to skip parts of the game as well.

764
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:43,230
So, it was pretty simple, but it was also proposed from Yoko-san.

765
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:13,774
So you are totally welcome if you want to skip the cutscenes and skip the game parts and just go for the trophies.

766
01:01:14,335 --> 01:01:16,096
I'm all okay with that.

767
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:20,900
So I'm going to pick my last one.

768
01:01:22,561 --> 01:01:24,083
Okay, so I'm going to pick my last one.

769
01:01:26,365 --> 01:01:27,345
Yeah, that one? No?

770
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:41,342
Is alcohol necessary to write a scenario?

771
01:01:42,123 --> 01:01:46,526
Interestingly, or maybe not so interestingly enough, the stuff that I write while I'm a

772
01:01:46,546 --> 01:01:48,047
little tipsy and drunk is usually a lot more popular.

773
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:06,773
I think if you think too much and talk too much, it won't work, so I think it's better to drink and be a little stupid.

774
01:02:10,674 --> 01:02:15,419
You know, I've concluded that when I'm like super proper and serious and thinking about work,

775
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:18,902
it doesn't really come into shape the way that I want it.

776
01:02:19,002 --> 01:02:23,527
So it's alright to have a little bit of alcohol, get a little tipsy,

777
01:02:23,887 --> 01:02:29,293
have a little fun, and make it easier for me to come up with my own ideas and put it in writing.

778
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,615
But if I write while I'm drinking, I end up falling asleep in about an hour.

779
01:02:33,587 --> 01:02:35,908
The only drawback is that when I do that,

780
01:02:36,848 --> 01:02:39,589
the productivity level is really low.

781
01:02:40,229 --> 01:02:44,310
And so because I will pass out easily maybe in an hour.

782
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:49,812
So did you all have fun today?

783
01:02:50,112 --> 01:02:52,272
Well, I hope you guys enjoyed our talk today.

784
01:02:52,292 --> 01:02:54,513
Thank you.
