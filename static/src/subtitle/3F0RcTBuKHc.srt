1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,201
As those videos illustrated, your contributions to the industry have been phenomenal.

2
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:12,922
Every game that you've made is one of my personal favorites.

3
00:00:14,142 --> 00:00:16,883
I noticed in the retrospective video that you said you have a love of wine.

4
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:20,224
Have you had a chance to try our California wine?

5
00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:23,544
Yeah.

6
00:00:23,964 --> 00:00:28,345
So, he's been drinking since he got on the plane.

7
00:00:32,706 --> 00:00:33,747
My favorite.

8
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,227
California wine is great.

9
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:44,380
Okay, boy, let's get started.

10
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,762
RPGs have traditionally been much more fantastical in nature.

11
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:55,324
And when I first saw Shenmue, I noticed how real it was.

12
00:00:56,045 --> 00:00:58,526
Everything looked just so real.

13
00:01:00,807 --> 00:01:04,068
Some of the details that you've included in the game, I just couldn't believe it.

14
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,123
What do you think makes you so different from other game

15
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:08,643
developers?

16
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:12,087
And do you feel you represent a new kind of developer?

17
00:01:13,048 --> 00:01:16,212
He does not necessarily think of himself as a new type of

18
00:01:16,252 --> 00:01:17,533
game developer.

19
00:01:27,523 --> 00:01:29,263
I've talked to a lot of different creators,

20
00:01:29,283 --> 00:01:31,684
but no one has made games the same way I have.

21
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,464
The way they make games is different,

22
00:01:33,484 --> 00:01:34,945
so the final product is also different.

23
00:01:57,532 --> 00:02:02,353
And he thinks that watching movies or looking up at the sky or at the sunset, those kind

24
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,613
of stimulations are very important.

25
00:02:03,653 --> 00:02:05,034
And I would like to keep making games this way.

26
00:02:05,074 --> 00:02:06,334
Looking back at your older games,

27
00:02:24,703 --> 00:02:32,890
Technology has advanced so much, yet it always seems as you've been creating your games that you've been on the edge of technology.

28
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:35,552
You're a true visionary.

29
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:43,979
I would be interested to know, what was the development process like when you first started developing games, and how has it changed?

30
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:57,416
So he started making games back in 1983.

31
00:02:57,476 --> 00:02:59,417
Back then, he was a programmer.

32
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:00,998
So the team consisted of two programmers, one artist,

33
00:03:01,018 --> 00:03:01,838
and one sound staff.

34
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:29,096
So a little room was enough for the team to develop the games.

35
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:33,839
So with Shenmue, by the end, at the very last stage,

36
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:36,060
there were over 300 people on the project.

37
00:03:46,071 --> 00:03:51,635
I've put the video of the making of Shenmue together, so let's take a look at it.

38
00:04:18,348 --> 00:04:21,229
He was on a journey to seek a vision of a new world.

39
00:04:34,996 --> 00:04:39,218
In his mind, vaguely, an image of a new game was about to emerge.

40
00:04:45,557 --> 00:04:49,639
The vast land and the long history was appealing something to him.

41
00:05:39,843 --> 00:05:43,767
This is how the task of establishing the image of a new game began.

42
00:05:43,787 --> 00:05:56,838
As you may all know, game development is a group work done by a large number of staffs.

43
00:05:57,238 --> 00:06:00,561
In the very beginning, music was made.

44
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,403
And the purpose of this music was to have the staffs broaden their imagination freely,

45
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:13,045
and then to have them absorb all that inspires them.

46
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:20,871
No compositions, no pictures or photographs, only music to enhance their imagination.

47
00:06:24,193 --> 00:06:25,074
Then, films.

48
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:27,499
were made to expand the visual image.

49
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,342
Creation of the main characters, which are the most important subjects in the game, was

50
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:40,363
far more difficult than what was expected.

51
00:06:42,104 --> 00:06:47,446
Even with the ideal side views and the ideal front views, an ideal 3D model could not be

52
00:06:47,486 --> 00:06:47,786
made.

53
00:06:50,887 --> 00:06:54,008
Even after countless trials, a desirable image could not be achieved.

54
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:02,384
At the end, a real-sized sculpture was made to 3D scan, and an accurate ideal character

55
00:07:02,404 --> 00:07:03,025
was generated.

56
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:09,709
Also, enormous number of image boards were made to visualize the world which surround

57
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,389
the characters.

58
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:26,504
This is how the development of the project, codenamed Barkley, was commenced.

59
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:55,396
End this pursuit of high quality and the challenge to embody the images they have in their minds.

60
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:58,739
There is no tolerance for anything less.

61
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:37,226
Every motion had to be endorsed accurate by actual human motion.

62
00:08:55,867 --> 00:09:01,574
Based on the presumed emotion curves of the player, the story was enhanced with more depth.

63
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,805
Then, one question started to grow among the staffs.

64
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,647
Is this really a game?

65
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,200
Thank you.

66
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:24,742
That is so inspiring.

67
00:10:24,882 --> 00:10:29,867
One of the things I noticed was the animation.

68
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:32,270
And coming from a sports game background,

69
00:10:33,671 --> 00:10:37,275
we do so much in motion capturing with our animations.

70
00:10:37,996 --> 00:10:41,139
And I was surprised by the tremendous animation

71
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:42,700
in Chenmue.

72
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:45,063
How did you actually do all of your animations?

73
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,661
I use animation a lot when I play sports.

74
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,603
The animation in this game is amazing.

75
00:10:49,643 --> 00:10:51,204
How do you capture motion in Shenmue?

76
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:53,366
I'm sure you all know, but Greg,

77
00:10:53,406 --> 00:10:59,011
Greg Kallai's American football and basketball are also beautifully animated.

78
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:15,389
I think you all are aware of the games Greg made,

79
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,431
and Yusan sees the animations in those games.

80
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:20,272
It's spectacular.

81
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:21,833
Thank you so much.

82
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:30,659
We've been using motion capturing since back when we were creating Virtua Fighter.

83
00:11:39,827 --> 00:11:46,199
We are currently using various types of motion capture, such as magnetic and optical systems.

84
00:11:52,888 --> 00:11:56,190
We use motion capture for the body, hand, and facial movements.

85
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:57,770
We use motion capture in many ways.

86
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:02,212
Unlike Virtua Fighter, we use motion capture systems for Shenmue to make small movements.

87
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:32,772
So in Shenmue, we are using a motion capture system which could capture more detailed, more smaller motions, more precise motions, not big motions.

88
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:36,754
YOSHIMASA ENJI, SPEAKING JAPANESE, INTERPRETER 2

89
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:56,695
We had to instruct the motion actors how to move for certain special martial arts.

90
00:12:57,436 --> 00:13:00,158
And that's what we had to do before actually capturing motions.

91
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:05,942
And so we have a video which shows how motion was captured in Shenmue.

92
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:06,843
Let's take a look at it.

93
00:13:06,883 --> 00:13:08,444
Yu-san will appear in it also.

94
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:39,706
Currently, he's giving instructions on how the motion actor should act.

95
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:41,068
And the timing...

96
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:14,512
As you can see, you can see the action scene or the motion capturing scene and also the

97
00:14:14,532 --> 00:14:29,957
game scene. So you can see how the motions are applied in the actual game.

98
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:47,338
So there are currently in game development that there are so many works you have to do other than just programming.

99
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:06,282
So Yu-san, Shenmue is this huge success in Japan.

100
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:11,119
And I thank you very much for sending me a copy, by the way.

101
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,882
But I can't speak Japanese, and I don't understand exactly

102
00:15:15,902 --> 00:15:17,123
what's going on in the game.

103
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:19,105
I've tried for hours and hours.

104
00:15:21,226 --> 00:15:22,427
I really, really want to play it.

105
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:24,408
Will it be released in the US?

106
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:27,651
And could we maybe see a peek of it?

107
00:15:28,331 --> 00:15:30,352
SPEAKER 1 IN JAPANESE

108
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:39,816
We are currently working hard on the localization.

109
00:15:41,697 --> 00:15:43,238
The scenario is huge.

110
00:15:43,258 --> 00:15:46,700
And the translations of the scenario has just been completed recently.

111
00:16:03,991 --> 00:16:08,373
In Shenmue 1, there are 350 characters.

112
00:16:08,393 --> 00:16:10,953
And we have decided on 200 voice actors so far.

113
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:34,354
Too many.

114
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:38,237
Too expensive.

115
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:49,806
Okay, so we brought with us a video with some English narrations and some English voiceovers.

116
00:16:49,826 --> 00:16:50,586
So let's take a look.

117
00:17:11,562 --> 00:17:12,703
For more information, please contact...

118
00:17:12,723 --> 00:17:12,743
I...

119
00:17:12,763 --> 00:17:12,963
I... Francis.

120
00:17:13,043 --> 00:17:13,523
I... Francis. Who...

121
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:17,445
I... Francis. Who... dies...

122
00:17:19,466 --> 00:17:31,573
I... Francis. Who... dies... in my arms.

123
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:39,897
I... Francis. Who... dies... in my arms. I'm sorry.

124
00:17:44,352 --> 00:17:44,833
No way.

125
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:47,234
Nooooooo...

126
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,275
But in progress?

127
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:50,575
But okay!

128
00:17:50,795 --> 00:17:50,975
Uh...

129
00:17:51,296 --> 00:17:54,457
That way, right?

130
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:58,119
Constant improvements!

131
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,180
You know what...

132
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,623
I think you just need to retrace the flow of C.

133
00:18:06,643 --> 00:18:08,203
Tylenol and pad, and you got it.

134
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,771
Remember to vote in the third box or the link in the description

135
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:19,032
if you're thinking about getting a game by  users in the future.

136
00:18:19,152 --> 00:18:20,252
In the meantime, LETS...

137
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:20,552
SAVE

138
00:18:20,572 --> 00:18:20,932
STEAL

139
00:18:20,992 --> 00:18:21,292
NO, PLEASE!

140
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:21,673
DO NOT!

141
00:18:39,048 --> 00:18:42,411
The Game inside will not open right now

142
00:18:42,651 --> 00:18:43,932
I will be back later

143
00:18:44,053 --> 00:18:47,535
It's the game itself

144
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:49,317
Welcome to The Origin of Decadence

145
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,753
I'm sorry.

146
00:19:29,537 --> 00:19:35,161
I'm sorry.

147
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:35,921
I'm sorry.

148
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,622
Excuse me.

149
00:19:42,345 --> 00:19:44,906
Oh, sensei Asougi's boy.

150
00:19:47,408 --> 00:19:49,089
I'm going to use your instructions again.

151
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:58,424
Of course, provided it's something I am familiar with, this type of pressure stone is poorly found.

152
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:45,430
Well, all I can say is I, and I think everyone here,

153
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,471
is so happy to see that.

154
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:50,494
I think I'm going to have to try to convince you to get me

155
00:20:50,555 --> 00:20:51,335
a GD or something.

156
00:20:52,156 --> 00:20:57,280
Every time I see Shenmue, one of the things that just blows me

157
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,062
away is the direction.

158
00:21:00,262 --> 00:21:03,885
And it looks like a Hollywood heavyweight made it.

159
00:21:05,026 --> 00:21:07,668
And the story is just so amazing.

160
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:11,511
Can you tell us a bit about the storyline and your vision?

161
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:13,653
It's quite surprising.

162
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:16,337
It's like a masterpiece of Hollywood.

163
00:21:16,357 --> 00:21:19,302
You use a lot of film-like approaches in the design.

164
00:21:19,342 --> 00:21:21,826
Could you tell us about the story line and the vision of the game?

165
00:21:34,886 --> 00:21:37,708
A man from China comes to meet...

166
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:43,811
not meet, but comes in front of Ryo Hazuki, the main character, who's living in Japan.

167
00:21:49,535 --> 00:21:54,858
So one day, when Ryo comes home, he sees that man fighting with his father.

168
00:21:54,878 --> 00:21:56,679
He sees his father being killed.

169
00:21:58,531 --> 00:22:01,552
And right in front of Ryo's eyes, his father gets murdered.

170
00:22:02,552 --> 00:22:05,353
And so the whole story is Ryo pursuing to solve the mystery behind his father's death,

171
00:22:05,373 --> 00:22:06,773
which eventually goes over to China.

172
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:29,821
And so since it's a long story, in Shenmue 1,

173
00:22:30,781 --> 00:22:31,982
it'll only take place in Japan.

174
00:22:32,382 --> 00:22:36,125
And from Shenmue 2, the story will take over to China.

175
00:22:36,145 --> 00:22:43,869
So the vast story will begin in Shenmue 2.

176
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:55,737
But today, I brought some footage from Shenmue 2.

177
00:24:06,635 --> 00:24:19,743
Pull the encoder to unlock the laptop.

178
00:24:19,883 --> 00:24:34,052
Pull the encoder to unlock the laptop.

179
00:24:36,418 --> 00:24:38,400
You opened it?

180
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,901
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

181
00:24:41,361 --> 00:24:43,302
Go ahead, read it.

182
00:24:43,342 --> 00:24:44,523
Can you read it?

183
00:24:45,304 --> 00:24:50,026
Someone else read it, as well.

184
00:25:09,514 --> 00:25:10,515
I'm Max Stephanie, and thank you for listening.

185
00:26:04,795 --> 00:26:07,777
You know, the characters look so amazing, I can't believe it.

186
00:26:08,517 --> 00:26:11,018
And you say there are 350 of them.

187
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:12,419
I mean, that's so many.

188
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:13,740
Too many.

189
00:26:16,224 --> 00:26:18,725
How did you create them?

190
00:26:18,765 --> 00:26:22,126
How did you go about really making them so real?

191
00:26:23,307 --> 00:26:27,749
I'm surprised at how realistic and profound they are.

192
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:28,949
How were they achieved?

193
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:33,651
As I explained earlier,

194
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:37,272
we first made the main characters.

195
00:26:37,693 --> 00:26:40,434
As we mentioned before, the main characters,

196
00:26:41,714 --> 00:26:44,555
the sculptures were made of the main characters at the very beginning.

197
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:49,275
So this 3D scan, and then we 3D scan the sculptures.

198
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,536
But then that would end up having a 50,000 poly face.

199
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:53,357
And then we would need to reduce the polygons.

200
00:27:06,614 --> 00:27:08,595
We're not making games for PlayStation 2.

201
00:27:08,675 --> 00:27:17,378
And then we apply facial animation onto the models.

202
00:27:35,165 --> 00:27:42,591
In Shenmue, we have a new technology called a mouth clip, which is a technology where

203
00:27:42,651 --> 00:27:46,554
we can have the models automatically synchronize the voice.

204
00:27:46,574 --> 00:27:49,997
So we have a Dreamcast with us.

205
00:27:50,017 --> 00:27:51,318
We would like to do a demo.

206
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:54,000
So could we have Dreamcast 1 on the screen?

207
00:28:04,703 --> 00:28:07,644
Let's start with this beautiful lady.

208
00:28:07,664 --> 00:28:07,944
Please wait.

209
00:28:07,964 --> 00:28:08,665
No, no.

210
00:28:32,695 --> 00:28:33,596
This is real time.

211
00:28:33,616 --> 00:28:34,256
Let's try moving it.

212
00:28:34,276 --> 00:28:35,937
You can zoom in and zoom out.

213
00:28:35,957 --> 00:28:37,778
The reflection of the eyes is beautiful.

214
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:04,119
And the hair, the softness and how it moves naturally.

215
00:29:04,139 --> 00:29:08,083
So currently he's moving around the light, as you can see.

216
00:29:19,311 --> 00:29:23,074
It's as if he was born with those wings.

217
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:23,974
Wow, Greg likes ears.

218
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:25,515
It seems that Greg likes ears.

219
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,977
The fairy tale is one bright...

220
00:29:28,538 --> 00:29:29,298
I like details.

221
00:29:29,598 --> 00:29:32,560
The details here are amazing.

222
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,802
...beginning.

223
00:29:34,822 --> 00:29:36,623
Let's try a different character.

224
00:29:36,703 --> 00:29:37,804
Let's try a different character.

225
00:29:37,824 --> 00:29:40,226
I may have made a mistake in the order, but...

226
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:59,027
We have an English speaking character, so let's try him.

227
00:29:59,447 --> 00:30:00,827
His name is Mark Kimberly.

228
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:04,328
He's going to talk about the system of doing shopping in Chenmue.

229
00:30:04,408 --> 00:30:04,968
So he's going to talk.

230
00:30:17,134 --> 00:30:17,594
For you, son.

231
00:30:45,178 --> 00:30:48,100
Oh, convenience stores aren't the only place to shop.

232
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:50,843
Candy stores are also a great place.

233
00:30:51,704 --> 00:30:59,911
They have lots of stuff that will bring back childhood memories.

234
00:31:00,051 --> 00:31:01,972
It's really fun.

235
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:04,815
So, as you can see, the facial animations are...

236
00:31:05,335 --> 00:31:08,738
They're meant to move very much, very naturally.

237
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:11,060
I'll tell you about part-time jobs.

238
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,301
The mouth movements are recorded first, and then the computer automatically syncs them.

239
00:31:40,355 --> 00:31:42,136
The 4-player operator is definitely it.

240
00:31:42,356 --> 00:31:44,758
I'll teach you everything there is to know.

241
00:31:44,858 --> 00:31:45,599
That's great.

242
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:46,119
That's...

243
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:54,325
Wow.

244
00:31:54,365 --> 00:31:54,485
Wow.

245
00:31:54,505 --> 00:31:54,646
Wow.

246
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:54,726
Wow.

247
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:55,086
Wow.

248
00:31:55,106 --> 00:31:55,246
Wow.

249
00:31:55,266 --> 00:31:55,366
Wow.

250
00:31:55,386 --> 00:31:56,887
So, Yusan, Shenmue is such a huge game.

251
00:31:57,027 --> 00:31:57,248
Yes.

252
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:01,451
Since you're the creator of the game, would you...

253
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:04,813
Could you take us maybe through parts of the game?

254
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:08,256
Could you show us some of the actual gameplay?

255
00:32:09,484 --> 00:32:16,166
So last night he went through the trouble of setting the date of the Dreamcast to Christmas Eve.

256
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:18,186
So he would like to go in and make a demo.

257
00:32:18,206 --> 00:32:18,766
Can we have Dreamcast 2?

258
00:32:39,504 --> 00:32:40,664
This is Ryo's room.

259
00:32:41,245 --> 00:32:43,285
He's going to walk around.

260
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:53,988
If you press the A button, the door opens.

261
00:32:54,488 --> 00:33:00,530
So when you see an A icon of an A button, by pressing it, the door opens.

262
00:33:06,012 --> 00:33:09,896
And so since this house is so big, he's just going to take a look at some rooms.

263
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:11,837
And this is the kitchen.

264
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,222
And that lady there is the housekeeper.

265
00:33:33,723 --> 00:33:41,226
Now, he just obtained information from the housekeeper.

266
00:33:46,468 --> 00:33:49,529
So, when Ryo obtains some information,

267
00:33:50,189 --> 00:33:56,011
the signal shows that new information has been added into your memo book.

268
00:33:59,249 --> 00:34:05,491
All the important information is written in the memo.

269
00:34:05,531 --> 00:34:12,434
On the first page, you'll find her phone number.

270
00:34:12,454 --> 00:34:13,295
If you call her, she'll answer.

271
00:34:29,018 --> 00:34:34,720
And you can open drawers.

272
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:40,783
So since this is a kitchen, you see what you see in the kitchen.

273
00:34:44,504 --> 00:34:52,768
So this is the fridge.

274
00:34:53,408 --> 00:34:57,670
So you can actually buy stuff at the convenience store and store it in the fridge.

275
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:08,954
Let's take a look at a different room.

276
00:35:10,755 --> 00:35:12,977
That's a Japanese living room.

277
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:14,598
Very small.

278
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,081
And there's a TV in the back.

279
00:35:30,694 --> 00:35:32,895
So he's going to open the TV rack.

280
00:35:53,913 --> 00:35:56,614
I'm excited to see what happens when I buy this.

281
00:35:56,674 --> 00:36:00,794
Okay, so you gotta get Shimu to find out what you can do with this Saturn.

282
00:36:06,316 --> 00:36:07,096
That was his allowance.

283
00:36:07,136 --> 00:36:08,456
He got it from his father.

284
00:36:08,476 --> 00:36:09,997
What should I do?

285
00:36:10,057 --> 00:36:10,917
Let's go outside.

286
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:28,452
It's snowing.

287
00:36:28,512 --> 00:36:31,354
I went to Dobuita, but I made a mistake.

288
00:36:31,374 --> 00:36:33,655
In Shenmue, the weather changes constantly.

289
00:36:33,695 --> 00:36:34,636
I'll try running.

290
00:36:34,676 --> 00:36:40,760
He's gonna try running.

291
00:36:55,259 --> 00:37:12,631
Trying to catch up to the scooter.

292
00:37:13,952 --> 00:37:16,734
So at night you'll see many neon signs.

293
00:37:17,574 --> 00:37:18,895
There are many bars around here.

294
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:34,774
So as you can see, the sound of the footstep changes depending on the surface of the road.

295
00:37:34,854 --> 00:37:38,577
So when he's walking over snow, it sounds like he's walking over snow.

296
00:37:39,898 --> 00:37:40,638
This is a pretty big town.

297
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:43,721
So that's the convenience store.

298
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:15,231
The name of the convenience store is Tomato March.

299
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:17,932
You got Shenmue potato chips.

300
00:38:17,952 --> 00:38:26,096
So when you buy a Shenmue potato chips, it comes with a sort of like a raffle.

301
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:41,046
Welcome, Tazuki-kun.

302
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:41,226
This.

303
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:43,087
So, item get, right?

304
00:38:43,107 --> 00:38:46,890
Then, draw a lottery ticket.

305
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,370
You lost.

306
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:59,577
I'm sorry, you bought it for me.

307
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:07,591
I don't know how many items he has right now.

308
00:39:07,671 --> 00:39:15,314
He doesn't seem to have many right now.

309
00:39:15,334 --> 00:39:17,214
Let's go to a different store.

310
00:39:30,721 --> 00:39:32,802
There was someone blocking it from the door.

311
00:39:32,822 --> 00:39:36,723
So he's going to try going into the arcade.

312
00:40:17,504 --> 00:40:18,685
Game Center U.

313
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:20,745
It's called Game Center U.

314
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,886
There's a Hang On sign here.

315
00:40:23,026 --> 00:40:24,327
Okay, there's Hang On.

316
00:40:48,391 --> 00:40:49,832
And you have darts.

317
00:40:50,452 --> 00:40:53,593
And you have old games.

318
00:40:54,173 --> 00:40:54,573
Classics.

319
00:40:55,273 --> 00:40:55,974
Space Harrier.

320
00:40:57,114 --> 00:40:58,154
Oh, and there's Space Harrier.

321
00:40:59,115 --> 00:40:59,835
Space Harrier.

322
00:40:59,895 --> 00:41:00,815
Space Harrier.

323
00:41:01,656 --> 00:41:02,676
100 yen per play.

324
00:41:02,936 --> 00:41:07,538
That's like my all-time favorite.

325
00:41:07,618 --> 00:41:08,098
I'll try it.

326
00:41:08,158 --> 00:41:09,298
So he's gonna try playing it.

327
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:14,760
100 yen.

328
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:17,201
Back in him again.

329
00:41:18,165 --> 00:41:19,166
Let's play a bit.

330
00:41:20,366 --> 00:41:22,487
I'm getting serious.

331
00:41:53,862 --> 00:41:55,423
Get ready.

332
00:41:55,543 --> 00:41:56,943
One more time.

333
00:41:57,004 --> 00:41:59,565
We don't have much time, so we'll stop.

334
00:41:59,645 --> 00:42:04,186
Okay, so since we don't have that much time, we're going to stop here.

335
00:42:04,246 --> 00:42:04,346
Ah.

336
00:42:04,366 --> 00:42:04,587
That's it.

337
00:42:22,178 --> 00:42:26,880
I seriously think I financed one of your first Ferraris with the quarters I put into Harrier.

338
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,421
You obviously have a really strong fighting game background.

339
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:36,522
Being the creator of Virtua Fighter, the all-time greatest fight game.

340
00:42:37,603 --> 00:42:41,444
The sequences of fighting that I've seen in Shenmue are even more amazing.

341
00:42:42,804 --> 00:42:45,565
Can you show us the approach that you use to get these sequences?

342
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:46,961
I'm a fighting game expert.

343
00:42:47,001 --> 00:42:48,502
Could you tell us about the battle system?

344
00:42:48,542 --> 00:42:50,683
In Shenmue, we have three big battle systems.

345
00:42:50,703 --> 00:42:56,726
One is a battle system where you have to punch in the command, sort of like Virtua Fighter.

346
00:43:11,103 --> 00:43:16,908
The next one is called, it's a new system, it's called QTE Battle.

347
00:43:17,308 --> 00:43:19,830
It's a system where you can play by pressing only one button.

348
00:43:22,752 --> 00:43:29,858
And the last one is called Move Instructions, where you get instructed of martial arts moves.

349
00:43:35,433 --> 00:43:39,957
So in the game, you can meet people and have them instruct you of new moves.

350
00:43:41,017 --> 00:43:42,979
And for the moves which you mastered, you can use in the free battle.

351
00:43:42,999 --> 00:43:45,541
Okay, so we have a video showing the battle system, so let's take a look.

352
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:05,448
This is free battle.

353
00:44:05,688 --> 00:44:07,709
It's where you have to punch in the commands.

354
00:44:12,351 --> 00:44:15,432
So unlike Virtua Fighter, you can fight against multiple number of enemies.

355
00:44:18,153 --> 00:44:26,336
It's made to be very simple.

356
00:44:27,877 --> 00:44:29,177
This is called the QTE battle.

357
00:44:33,275 --> 00:44:39,320
The control is easy, but you can get cinematic, dynamic action.

358
00:44:47,765 --> 00:44:53,990
And this is the move instruction, and this old man here, he's going to instruct him, instruct Yoh a move.

359
00:44:55,010 --> 00:44:58,173
He's going to give him instructions such as move right or move left.

360
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:02,971
Stand lower.

361
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:06,897
And this here, he has mastered a move.

362
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:08,059
So these are the three battle systems.

363
00:45:22,964 --> 00:45:27,187
So I noticed in that prior demo that you said in Christmas

364
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:28,068
evening it was snowing.

365
00:45:28,568 --> 00:45:31,631
And I'd read about something called Magic Weather, but I

366
00:45:31,891 --> 00:45:32,452
haven't seen it.

367
00:45:33,352 --> 00:45:35,874
Can you kind of discuss what it is and maybe

368
00:45:35,914 --> 00:45:36,575
show us a bit of it?

369
00:45:37,115 --> 00:45:38,416
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JR.:

370
00:45:38,477 --> 00:45:39,277
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JR.:

371
00:45:39,297 --> 00:45:39,978
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JR.:

372
00:45:40,819 --> 00:45:41,959
YOSHIMASA ENJI, JR.:

373
00:45:41,979 --> 00:45:43,901
Shemu is a full 3D interactive game.

374
00:45:47,808 --> 00:45:51,470
But however, there are other such games, 3D real-time games, so we have added the element

375
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,010
of time into Shenmue.

376
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:05,692
As time changes, naturally the weather changes also.

377
00:46:05,712 --> 00:46:09,956
So by adding the element of time, we had no choice but to change the weather in the game.

378
00:46:27,085 --> 00:46:32,629
Okay, so we have a video with English narration on it of the Magic Weather and Time Control.

379
00:46:32,649 --> 00:46:42,937
Let's take a look.

380
00:46:43,517 --> 00:46:46,239
So this is spring, in spring you see cherry blossoms.

381
00:46:52,164 --> 00:46:52,965
This is Dreamcast.

382
00:46:54,992 --> 00:47:02,615
I will then be reviewing the transcript as it will be read aloud.

383
00:47:02,715 --> 00:47:07,277
I'm going to be reviewing the transcript as it is read aloud.

384
00:47:07,657 --> 00:47:11,138
It's a wonderful experience to be able to read.

385
00:47:11,218 --> 00:47:16,740
I'm going to be reviewing the transcript as it is read aloud.

386
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:23,443
I'm here to play a very famous game, the same event in the style of Gandori.

387
00:47:24,024 --> 00:47:27,205
In another way, it was amazing and astonishing.

388
00:47:27,225 --> 00:47:35,568
Players who don't know time in a question may learn at the next time a whole different planet.

389
00:47:41,565 --> 00:47:48,930
This new system, which may be the high level of freedom and reality, is a magical weapon.

390
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:57,195
The point of time, and the change in weather, the change room is the explosive, the war time.

391
00:47:58,035 --> 00:48:00,737
But certain cases may not always look the same.

392
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:29,591
So, at this time, first of all, I've been so lucky to be able to ask you questions.

393
00:48:29,811 --> 00:48:32,952
I wanted to make sure that any of the members of the audience who wanted to ask questions,

394
00:48:33,472 --> 00:48:38,454
if you would kind of pass your question cards to the side, someone can pick them up, I believe.

395
00:48:39,275 --> 00:48:40,615
Okay, let me ask a couple more.

396
00:48:42,796 --> 00:48:43,936
Let's talk more about the future.

397
00:48:44,917 --> 00:48:50,099
How do you see games evolving in the future, and how do you see the creative process changing?

398
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,981
Network will be more and more important.

399
00:49:11,577 --> 00:49:15,920
And also he sees that a new genre in games will be created.

400
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:20,563
I want to create a new market, a new genre.

401
00:49:20,643 --> 00:49:25,427
I want to create a genre where movies and games are the same.

402
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:31,301
I would like to create a new genre that combines the reality of games with the interactivity of games.

403
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,373
Shenmue 1 was the first challenge towards that.

404
00:50:19,439 --> 00:50:22,682
What challenges do you face when you're building the team?

405
00:50:23,322 --> 00:50:25,424
I know it's such a large team, but what challenges do you face?

406
00:50:43,882 --> 00:50:54,630
For the project team of Shenmue, only 30% were actual SEGA employees.

407
00:50:56,371 --> 00:51:01,494
And others were people from other industries, such as movie directors or cameramen,

408
00:51:02,095 --> 00:51:02,735
scenario writers,

409
00:51:02,755 --> 00:51:03,796
professional architects.

410
00:51:09,826 --> 00:51:13,329
And he had the chance to work with many people from other industries.

411
00:51:13,889 --> 00:51:18,353
And he was able to build a nice network with people from other industries, and that was very valuable.

412
00:51:18,433 --> 00:51:26,640
And he was able to build a nice network with people from other industries, and that was very valuable.

413
00:51:36,002 --> 00:51:40,285
And he learned that the difficulty of managing a team

414
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:41,986
is proportionate to the size.

415
00:51:49,892 --> 00:51:53,355
In thinking about future games, and of course that really

416
00:51:53,395 --> 00:51:58,419
excites me, are there things that you develop very

417
00:51:58,479 --> 00:52:00,480
differently, and the techniques that you've

418
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,522
pioneered in Shenmue?

419
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:05,933
are so different than what I'm used to.

420
00:52:07,494 --> 00:52:10,256
Could these techniques be applied to any other genre?

421
00:52:24,158 --> 00:52:33,382
He feels that the technology behind Shemoo, when used for like architecture or for presentation purposes, it'll be very effective.

422
00:52:34,202 --> 00:52:38,724
And he sees that this technology can also be applied to arcade games, which he has been making.

423
00:52:38,784 --> 00:52:40,845
He made the Ferrari game, which is the newest arcade game.

424
00:52:54,082 --> 00:52:59,667
For the arcade game, the very recent title he released was a Ferrari game, F355 Challenge.

425
00:53:00,647 --> 00:53:11,276
In the development of that game, at the very beginning stage, we actually made a concept movie which had a storyline.

426
00:53:21,876 --> 00:53:25,517
So as long as there's a story to it, the technology of Shenmue can be applied.

427
00:53:25,597 --> 00:53:28,038
And so we would like to take a look at the footage.

428
00:53:28,078 --> 00:53:30,078
And can we have the volume a little bit higher?

429
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:05,320
Mallory, you know that game so well.

430
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,060
Here, have a cookie.

431
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:06,261
Here.

432
00:54:06,301 --> 00:54:06,981
Thank you, Mallory!

433
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:08,082
I'm eating a cookie!

434
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:08,963
Enough, Mallory!

435
00:54:43,606 --> 00:54:44,426
Thank you for watching.

436
00:55:35,488 --> 00:55:42,871
The progress bar is at the top and you cannot clear it.

It does not belong to a game design company.

440
00:56:58,669 --> 00:57:02,852
This video is a fan worship.

441
00:57:03,273 --> 00:57:05,254
I can't believe I could believe this.

442
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:08,257
I truly have no idea what I'm doing.

443
00:57:37,365 --> 00:57:38,086
Wow.

444
00:57:38,126 --> 00:57:39,466
That is totally amazing.

445
00:57:39,646 --> 00:57:41,787
Okay, I've been told that we're out of time.

446
00:58:04,913 --> 00:58:06,174
Usain, I want to thank you so much.
