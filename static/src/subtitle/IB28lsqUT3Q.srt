1
00:00:06,082 --> 00:00:09,985
Sounds like we're about ready to get started. Good afternoon GDC Europe, how are you?

2
00:00:12,247 --> 00:00:13,268
Come on, how are you?

3
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:16,130
Having a great day today.

4
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:21,234
My name is Matthew and it's a pleasure to welcome you here to this exclusive

5
00:00:21,314 --> 00:00:24,036
GDC presentation of the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt.

6
00:00:25,097 --> 00:00:28,700
I just came in from Warsaw, Poland yesterday so I'm incredibly excited to

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,581
be here and so excited to share

8
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:32,703
what I have brought for you today.

9
00:00:39,357 --> 00:00:48,664
First, I'd like to welcome all of you, before we get started, back to the Witcher 3 Wild Hunt experience by showing you a brief trailer titled, Go Your Way.

10
00:01:55,531 --> 00:01:57,492
I'll take the long way round

11
00:01:57,632 --> 00:02:02,595
Oh, I'll find my own way down

12
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:09,339
Oh, as I should

13
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,924
And hold your gaze

14
00:02:16,964 --> 00:02:21,527
There's coke in the Midas touch

15
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:24,428
A joke in the way that we rust

16
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:30,334
And breathe again

17
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:33,156
And you'll find the lost

18
00:02:33,296 --> 00:02:38,078
And you'll fear what you've found

19
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:43,500
And the weather comes up

20
00:02:44,181 --> 00:02:46,242
Tearing down

21
00:02:46,302 --> 00:02:51,564
There'll be holes in the water

22
00:02:51,644 --> 00:02:54,586
There'll be birds on the ground

23
00:02:55,584 --> 00:02:58,889
There'll be things you never asked her

24
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:28,515
For those that are new to the story, The Witcher is based on a series of fantasy novels by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski.

25
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:34,978
Through this incredible story, players experience the life and the adventure of Geralt of Rivia.

26
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:42,262
Amongst the last of his kind, Geralt is a professional monster slayer with uncanny mutant abilities.

27
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:50,807
Known to the people simply as The Witcher, we join Geralt's story as he sets off across a long journey across the Northern Kingdoms.

28
00:04:52,873 --> 00:04:57,215
In addition to the mystery and the intrigue of this fantastic branching storyline,

29
00:04:57,895 --> 00:05:03,478
Witcher presents a role-playing game that enables the player to tell a story all their own.

30
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:06,479
And that's what I'd like to share with you today.

31
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,181
Starting with an overview of the Witcher's base game design,

32
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:15,943
we're going to dissect some of the fundamental systems that define the game's role-playing experience.

33
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:20,370
And as we do, we're going to consider some of the problems that we encountered,

34
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:23,953
why those problems appeared, and how they were approached.

35
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:29,656
Finally, we'll consider the state of the game at its release and the feedback that we received,

36
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,578
perhaps from some of the people sitting here in this room today,

37
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:36,121
the community online, and all the feedback that they gave.

38
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:40,513
and how the change has been integrated with the game because of it.

39
00:05:41,814 --> 00:05:49,202
Now, because investigating this set of core design mechanics will take us into a more deep appreciation of what's been learned,

40
00:05:49,742 --> 00:05:54,487
I hope you'll be able to take away some lessons that you'll be able to integrate with your own designs.

41
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:02,424
Now when you set out to develop an open world game, the most important experience to deliver

42
00:06:03,065 --> 00:06:06,889
is this design that encourages the player's freedom to explore.

43
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:11,254
And that's because open world games are all about exploration.

44
00:06:12,537 --> 00:06:22,241
They're about immersing the player within some massive world that provides an unprecedented feeling of open space and the freedom to explore it all.

45
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:32,185
Unfortunately, the truth is, roaming free across entire regions where the players explore without interruption is, well, it's boring.

46
00:06:32,205 --> 00:06:34,826
And nobody wants to play that game.

47
00:06:37,177 --> 00:06:41,162
In fact, one of the biggest complaints that most people have with the open world genre

48
00:06:41,222 --> 00:06:46,968
is that, at times, all this running around, just kind of going from point A to point B

49
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:51,092
in order to progress a quest can actually become quite tedious.

50
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:56,678
And I think that's why role-playing games blend in with this experience so perfectly.

51
00:06:57,593 --> 00:07:00,555
The player is given all this freedom with nothing to do until...

52
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:03,657
Hey look, all of a sudden there's a monster on the horizon.

53
00:07:04,638 --> 00:07:10,341
Or a chance to experience a merchant's small crafting collection,

54
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:14,844
or maybe a set of components that you hadn't experienced before.

55
00:07:14,864 --> 00:07:17,546
A rare sword with magical abilities,

56
00:07:17,606 --> 00:07:20,108
a new set of armor that could complete your collection.

57
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:24,351
These moments are what add the character and the depth to the world

58
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:26,933
that takes the player's immersion to the next level.

59
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:34,335
These game mechanics can provide skill-based interactions to what might otherwise be an

60
00:07:34,415 --> 00:07:39,277
uneventful experience, but I find it's the compelling nature of that role-playing that

61
00:07:39,317 --> 00:07:41,038
seems to keep players captivated.

62
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:47,382
Focusing on dynamics like risk and character progression, RPGs aren't about reaching a

63
00:07:47,422 --> 00:07:52,284
destination, it's really about the player's journey and what they experience along the

64
00:07:52,324 --> 00:07:52,444
way.

65
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:57,562
The key to that motivation is keeping the player rewarded for their actions,

66
00:07:58,382 --> 00:08:02,105
and a reward that matches the challenge that they've just overcome.

67
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:06,108
To do that, you must first understand each system.

68
00:08:06,968 --> 00:08:11,331
In the game, in order to eliminate exploits and establish a balanced experience,

69
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:16,975
that the player can understand that they can anticipate and eventually overcome.

70
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:21,940
By introducing an economy, we're actually providing a system

71
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,381
in which resources can be produced, consumed, and exchanged in quantifiable amounts.

72
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:29,982
However, in many games like The Witcher,

73
00:08:30,842 --> 00:08:35,464
intangible resources like health, experience, and skill are also a part of that experience.

74
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:42,906
And they can easily be considered a spendable resource, just like money, goods, and services.

75
00:08:43,867 --> 00:08:57,840
This creates a problem where as you try to identify each item and how they relate to each other, it makes a difficult choice, kind of a gut decision regarding whether this is more worthwhile than the other.

76
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:07,369
Now as we take a look at the Witcher economy, I'm going to share with you some of the ways that I use to approach these types of problems and some of the challenges that they present.

77
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:14,569
See, the game economy I tried to break down is fundamentally just two concepts.

78
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:17,130
You have resources and you have entities.

79
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:22,312
And in essence, all economies are going to revolve around resources.

80
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:24,053
That's the center of what they do.

81
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:25,814
They come and go.

82
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:27,034
They're bought and sold.

83
00:09:27,074 --> 00:09:28,355
They're created and destroyed.

84
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:30,276
It's always about resources.

85
00:09:30,976 --> 00:09:34,578
And by resources, I'm referring to anything that can be measured numerically.

86
00:09:35,258 --> 00:09:39,441
Which means basically, almost anything in your game could be known as a resource.

87
00:09:40,322 --> 00:09:44,104
Money, stamina, ability points, everything is an example of a resource,

88
00:09:44,525 --> 00:09:48,307
as are the items, upgrades, and even enemies that oppose the player.

89
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:52,530
And while not all of these resources are under the player's control,

90
00:09:53,171 --> 00:09:57,033
anything the player can produce, gather, collect, and again, destroy,

91
00:09:57,874 --> 00:09:59,415
is probably a type of resource.

92
00:10:01,388 --> 00:10:04,749
Additionally, resources are either tangible or intangible.

93
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,112
Tangible resources have physical properties in the game world.

94
00:10:09,152 --> 00:10:13,514
They exist at a particular location and often have to be moved somewhere else.

95
00:10:14,294 --> 00:10:18,136
Examples include items that Geralt carries around as inventory

96
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:21,658
or alchemical herbs in the world that can be harvested.

97
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:26,153
Intangible resources have no physical properties in the game whatsoever.

98
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:30,515
They do not occupy space, nor do they have a particular location in the world.

99
00:10:31,176 --> 00:10:35,558
For example, once a player defeats an enemy in battle, they are rewarded with experience,

100
00:10:35,978 --> 00:10:36,799
which is intangible.

101
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:40,421
Like crowns, experience is just a number.

102
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:42,850
It doesn't exist in the world.

103
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,394
For instance, the player doesn't need to physically manipulate experience

104
00:10:47,454 --> 00:10:48,715
in order to achieve a new level.

105
00:10:49,596 --> 00:10:52,179
Simply having the right amount of experience is enough.

106
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,344
Now the second concept of game economics is called an entity.

107
00:10:58,185 --> 00:11:01,508
And entities are used to store specific quantities of a resource.

108
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,812
For all the programmers and scripters in the house, you might just consider an entity a variable.

109
00:11:07,553 --> 00:11:08,993
Essentially that and nothing more.

110
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:23,320
An entity, named Level for example, explores the resource, level, or the current level of experience that the player has obtained.

111
00:11:24,873 --> 00:11:29,159
The player has an entity that stores Geralt's crowns resource.

112
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:32,304
As Geralt buys and sells gear, gains rewards and so on,

113
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:37,792
the amount of rewards, er, crowns in the entity, tend to reflect those changes.

114
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:44,560
Now that we have a solid understanding of both resources and entities,

115
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,645
we'll take a look at the four economic functions that I use to create the Witcher economy.

116
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:55,311
And as we do, I'll identify each resource and how it's affected by each function

117
00:11:55,912 --> 00:11:57,614
as they move around the economic system.

118
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,642
The first function is sources.

119
00:12:01,283 --> 00:12:05,826
And by sources, what we're talking about are mechanics that function just as their name implies.

120
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:11,791
They are a source of new materials, creating resources basically out of thin air.

121
00:12:12,592 --> 00:12:16,595
Their primary function, be it at a specific time or under certain circumstances,

122
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:20,319
is to generate new resource and store it in an entity.

123
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:26,848
Sources may be triggered by events in the game, switched on and off, or even be set to operate continuously,

124
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:31,153
producing these resources based on a specific production rate.

125
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:38,382
In The Witcher, for example, sources of these can be found as containers that the player can loot.

126
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:43,180
You can see at the top of the screen, Geralt doesn't recover from health naturally.

127
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,084
That means once damaged in combat, you'll need to drink a potion or eat some food to

128
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:49,245
regenerate over time.

129
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:53,549
That is also another resource for health.

130
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:06,118
At that point, you can also see sources in the form of flowers and plants, herbs that Geralt can harvest to collect

131
00:13:06,758 --> 00:13:13,626
alchemical ingredients that will be then used to make mutagens and some of the other potions and decoctions in his arsenal.

132
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,951
The second economic function is the trader.

133
00:13:18,997 --> 00:13:22,720
Traders are a mechanic that move resources from one entity to the other.

134
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:27,302
And, as that resource comes back in the opposite direction,

135
00:13:27,963 --> 00:13:31,105
it comes back according to some rules of an exchange.

136
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:35,087
The concept to remember here is that when dealing with a trader,

137
00:13:35,327 --> 00:13:37,029
nothing is really created or destroyed.

138
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:41,691
The process is simply exchanging resources between the entities.

139
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:49,889
In the Witcher, you can see this mechanic at play in the merchants Geralt visits to sell junk items or purchase new gear.

140
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:57,193
How does it work? Well, let's say during this interaction the player buys a sword from the blacksmith for 10 crowns.

141
00:13:58,033 --> 00:14:04,217
As that happens, the trader mechanic then transfers the crowns to the blacksmith from the crown's entity,

142
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:09,439
and then transfers that sword from the blacksmith's inventory directly to the player's inventory.

143
00:14:10,572 --> 00:14:12,673
One of the issues we had with this mechanic was that

144
00:14:13,034 --> 00:14:15,136
as players travel to different trader types

145
00:14:15,716 --> 00:14:18,038
a blacksmith, herbalist, book dealer, etc.

146
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,002
they may be able to sell all of their goods every time.

147
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:26,505
The problem with that was we were trying to create some level of believability in

148
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:27,266
this universe,

149
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:31,870
some realism, at which point it just didn't make sense for a poor herbalist

150
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,250
who had

151
00:14:32,631 --> 00:14:35,233
been living in a war-ravaged world of no man's land.

152
00:14:35,934 --> 00:14:39,115
to be interested in purchasing a rusty sword from Geralt.

153
00:14:40,175 --> 00:14:43,597
And as stated earlier, there needs to be some rules for this exchange.

154
00:14:44,097 --> 00:14:47,639
Rules that would provide some control over who and what could be traded.

155
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:52,441
Additionally, I needed rules to affect the price, because in short,

156
00:14:52,861 --> 00:14:57,343
sometimes an item's real value is quite different from what the item is worth.

157
00:15:00,652 --> 00:15:07,435
One side note regarding The Witcher is that everything to do with the economy and game balance came on incredibly late in the production.

158
00:15:08,415 --> 00:15:18,478
In fact, it was the last thing I worked on before shipping the game, considering there are hundreds of merchants already in place in the world, and crafters that needed balancing and adjustment.

159
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:24,200
It needed to make some big changes and something that would save a lot of time.

160
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,822
Something that would save me problems or not create bugs down the road.

161
00:15:29,642 --> 00:15:32,023
And I had to make some tough choices on how to proceed.

162
00:15:33,263 --> 00:15:38,425
So, because I had a lot of ideas, not only content side regarding how I wanted that system to work,

163
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:45,547
and that I'd probably be making some mistakes, changing my mind, and needing to manage these options going forward.

164
00:15:46,593 --> 00:15:53,377
I decided to create a tool called Reactor that could do this calculation of each price modifier at runtime.

165
00:15:54,897 --> 00:16:06,743
So, the power of Reactor isn't necessarily more than a simplified approach towards how the rules we're going to exchange were going to be determined.

166
00:16:08,804 --> 00:16:14,747
By comparing a matrix of data points regarding the item, its category, how rare it is, and where it came from,

167
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:21,391
I was able to put this against the type of merchant Geralt was trading with, where they

168
00:16:21,431 --> 00:16:25,573
were located and any discounts that might have already been gained by completing quests.

169
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:27,954
And the results were outstanding.

170
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:36,018
Very quickly, instead of presenting a single static value per item or per armor, the prices

171
00:16:36,058 --> 00:16:39,200
were calculated at runtime, making every trade unique.

172
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:43,722
What this did was it gave the feeling that the player was trading with a real merchant

173
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:45,103
in an active economy.

174
00:16:45,844 --> 00:16:48,265
where each item would present a different value

175
00:16:48,645 --> 00:16:51,387
based on the contextual state of the world around them.

176
00:16:52,307 --> 00:16:55,009
Additionally, it opened a new dimension to the experience

177
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:58,110
where more ambitious players could utilize this system

178
00:16:58,331 --> 00:17:02,153
to trade items across multiple regions at favorable rates.

179
00:17:03,133 --> 00:17:05,675
For instance, a blacksmith that gives preferred rates

180
00:17:05,755 --> 00:17:07,796
for rare weapons and magical upgrades

181
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:12,058
but is not interested in purchasing books or alchemical ingredients.

182
00:17:14,344 --> 00:17:18,667
As another example, in Skellige, a land where villages are hardy and well fed,

183
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:22,109
grain and meat can be purchased at reasonably low prices.

184
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:28,695
Players can bring these foods back to No Man's Land, a region ravaged by foreign war and famine,

185
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:33,058
and then trade those same goods for a very large turn of profit.

186
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:36,861
Creating this matrix of all possible values,

187
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:42,125
what I did was be able to store this data, in a sense, inside the code.

188
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:45,867
and then access that data very quickly using a hash map

189
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:49,948
that allowed me to return any value at near constant runtime.

190
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:56,271
Followed with a single pass in the editor to then mark up each merchant and item,

191
00:17:57,771 --> 00:18:01,193
these actors were given tags and a single callback

192
00:18:01,493 --> 00:18:06,395
to getPriceModifier. This returned how each actor should react

193
00:18:06,855 --> 00:18:09,656
based on the given series of weighted percentages or

194
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,877
the rules of the exchange.

195
00:18:14,935 --> 00:18:17,697
This brings us to our third economic function, which is drains.

196
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,499
And it's pretty easy to figure out here.

197
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:22,960
Drains are the opposite of sources, right?

198
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,982
So the sole responsibility is to take resources out of the game,

199
00:18:27,403 --> 00:18:30,164
reducing the amount stored in the resources entity

200
00:18:30,624 --> 00:18:32,045
and removing them permanently.

201
00:18:33,206 --> 00:18:34,347
Unlike the trade function,

202
00:18:35,027 --> 00:18:37,108
with drains, the resource is not saved.

203
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:40,250
It does not go anywhere or turn into anything else.

204
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,571
It simply disappears.

205
00:18:43,313 --> 00:18:46,075
In the Witcher, the crossbow bolt is an example of a drain.

206
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:50,519
This is not, you're not able to retrieve these resources.

207
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:53,482
Once you squeeze the trigger, the bolt flies and is gone.

208
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:57,485
Thus, you must go to a crafter and replace it,

209
00:18:57,806 --> 00:19:01,109
spending more money, thus draining you economically.

210
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:06,093
Additionally, the trader's function price modifier

211
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:08,515
we just discussed is a drain.

212
00:19:09,623 --> 00:19:12,204
Affecting costs involved with common interactions,

213
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,966
drains unfairly burden the player's budget

214
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:17,227
and work to reduce their purchasing power

215
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:18,588
over the course of the game.

216
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:21,310
Its only purpose is to prevent

217
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:24,271
the player from attaining infinite wealth.

218
00:19:25,692 --> 00:19:27,974
And drains have also been used to increase the cost

219
00:19:28,374 --> 00:19:30,095
that crafters charge for services.

220
00:19:30,975 --> 00:19:33,317
A dynamic drain that scales progressively

221
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,558
as the quality of the item increases.

222
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:38,500
While the players will never understand

223
00:19:39,485 --> 00:19:43,706
and secretly kinda hate you for taking all their money out of the game

224
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:48,848
it is one of the key resources and controller mechanisms that we as

225
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:49,868
designers can use

226
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:53,289
uh... to make sure that uh... we're

227
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:56,869
able to always buy for more and sell for less

228
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:01,271
so is kind of a rule of thumb anytime i'm thinking of a system whether it be

229
00:20:01,311 --> 00:20:04,211
an existing feature or something new that i want to make

230
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:08,192
the idea is to try and figure out a way to put in an economic drain

231
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:18,187
Finally, we'd like to discuss here this economic function of converters, where you're basically

232
00:20:18,227 --> 00:20:20,929
turning resources from one kind into another.

233
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:27,194
In the Witcher, this is the act of crafting, where the converter mechanic converts resources

234
00:20:27,234 --> 00:20:30,097
into swords and armor at a very specific rate.

235
00:20:31,037 --> 00:20:33,119
And for me, this is where the real fun begins.

236
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,924
Like traders, converters require values and rules that define the exchange.

237
00:20:39,892 --> 00:20:43,512
For the Witcher, these rules were defined by an item schematic.

238
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,602
The real problem here is that a large degree of interpretation with creating a schematic

239
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:56,144
starts to occur as the armor and swords become more complex.

240
00:20:56,865 --> 00:21:02,347
The number of ingredients mixed with the selecting type of a leather or an ore mixed with the

241
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:07,229
number of plates or chain mail or wire to hold it all together.

242
00:21:07,249 --> 00:21:10,370
It all becomes increasingly complex.

243
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,373
to craft even just a simple chess piece at times.

244
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:16,674
It's almost pure speculation.

245
00:21:17,715 --> 00:21:22,478
Then there's this additional concern where you're trying to take each item and balance it against each other.

246
00:21:23,469 --> 00:21:26,871
put a cost to it, make sure that everything is relative.

247
00:21:27,591 --> 00:21:31,353
This is all very, very difficult, and even for the best of designers,

248
00:21:32,154 --> 00:21:34,655
you don't want to be out there just making guesses.

249
00:21:35,115 --> 00:21:37,096
To reduce the complexity of these decisions,

250
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,518
and again, I was out of time, so I needed something fast.

251
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:43,740
What I did is I just redefined my entire approach,

252
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,302
and for this, I used a new system of game design that I call Witchcraft.

253
00:21:49,262 --> 00:21:50,623
And while it may sound like magic...

254
00:21:51,423 --> 00:21:57,125
Witchcraft is actually a system of tools, guidelines, and metrics that simplified my design process.

255
00:21:57,645 --> 00:22:04,267
It helped me eliminate exploits, and it helped automate content generation.

256
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:12,930
In short, it was my attempt to take a more scientific approach instead of basing all of my decisions on gut instinct alone.

257
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,190
Let's take a closer look here.

258
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:25,238
Using the structures we've just defined, it's not particularly difficult to identify what resources and entities comprise an economy.

259
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,543
But it can be difficult to get a good perspective on that system as a whole.

260
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:32,666
In effect, this is what witchcraft was all about.

261
00:22:34,648 --> 00:22:38,771
Again, the idea was to base my decisions on models of data instead of gut instinct.

262
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:44,076
And what I was trying to say is that in order to truly balance a numerically based system,

263
00:22:44,636 --> 00:22:49,941
I found it to best visualize the data trends rather than working on a per item basis.

264
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:55,966
For instance, if you were to plot points on graphs based on the amount of damage, assorted

265
00:22:56,006 --> 00:23:00,590
deals versus say the cost of that item, what shapes would those graphs reveal?

266
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:05,663
You can ask questions like, is the amount of given resources increasing over time?

267
00:23:06,564 --> 00:23:08,266
Are these increasing consistently?

268
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:13,151
Are resources distributed evenly or are there some progression stoppers where something

269
00:23:13,171 --> 00:23:15,033
has been more overused than another?

270
00:23:16,074 --> 00:23:20,738
Targeting concerns and visualizing the results is key to understanding the structure of your

271
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,402
economy and it's going to help lead you to the results.

272
00:23:26,603 --> 00:23:29,204
The answer, excuse me, this is all a bit generic.

273
00:23:29,244 --> 00:23:31,385
So what I did is kind of prepared a slide

274
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,447
from one of my actual data sets.

275
00:23:34,467 --> 00:23:36,688
And here, just like in the real world,

276
00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:40,931
I've represented this feature of the economy

277
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,432
with some charts and data points that I've plotted.

278
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:46,294
In this data set, you can see the rate

279
00:23:46,334 --> 00:23:47,774
of which spending was increasing

280
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:50,556
as the quality of each item approaches

281
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,177
that category and ceiling value.

282
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,583
Now at the small scale, individual points may appear to move chaotically, but from this

283
00:23:57,643 --> 00:24:02,567
greater perspective, I think we can all see this pattern that's emerging, right?

284
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:08,392
This process identified anomalies in item pricing, and the curve acted as a recommendation

285
00:24:08,972 --> 00:24:10,934
from which I could make additional adjustments.

286
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:16,373
And while it often required several iterations before I'd get the exact curve I was looking for,

287
00:24:16,874 --> 00:24:20,817
I found this experimentation led to results I hadn't considered before.

288
00:24:21,777 --> 00:24:26,341
For instance, you can see how the curve ramps up quickly and slows over time.

289
00:24:27,361 --> 00:24:31,484
Think about the impact, for a second, that this would make, say, on the early game experience.

290
00:24:32,565 --> 00:24:35,107
Something where even a small increase in quality

291
00:24:35,487 --> 00:24:38,169
could result in a very large increase in the player earning.

292
00:24:39,621 --> 00:24:45,844
What I feel is like this behavior I was looking to do, what I was asking is, is this the behavior I was looking to achieve?

293
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:52,547
Is this the type of progression? You know, I wanted a linear, do I want a quadratic, something exponential?

294
00:24:52,688 --> 00:24:54,909
What was I looking to achieve with this data?

295
00:24:55,749 --> 00:25:01,592
Again, we're not just manipulating numbers here, but we're actually trying to describe a world that tells a story.

296
00:25:02,807 --> 00:25:08,851
And because the witcher's fantasy is so grounded, all the armor is so real, the lethality of

297
00:25:08,891 --> 00:25:13,314
the damage, the monster design, everything is so based on things that we can appreciate.

298
00:25:13,374 --> 00:25:18,358
I kind of felt like this economy couldn't just show up with a $10,000 sword in a place

299
00:25:18,398 --> 00:25:19,739
where they can't afford to eat.

300
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,821
So that economy needed to feel poor as well.

301
00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:28,437
I also wanted items to increase in value so that by the end of the game you were kind

302
00:25:28,477 --> 00:25:30,200
of feeling pretty badass, right?

303
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:35,229
You were feeling tough because this thing really was expensive and you really had achieved

304
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:36,291
something to earn it.

305
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,773
With these goals in mind, I actually started to tune curves in a different way.

306
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:48,539
And I think it becomes apparently clear now how by reducing the rate of growth until the

307
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:53,685
end of the game, where relic items would continue to increase greatly in value, what I was doing

308
00:25:53,745 --> 00:25:55,527
is kind of stunting the player's growth.

309
00:25:56,428 --> 00:25:59,171
In a sense, eliminating the need for money altogether.

310
00:26:00,152 --> 00:26:05,015
They were finding things in containers and they would visit the stores and they could choose to buy that.

311
00:26:05,075 --> 00:26:09,498
But if they didn't really have a lot of money, this became this gray area of what do I do?

312
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:12,621
Do I disassemble something? Do I repair something?

313
00:26:13,081 --> 00:26:16,383
Do I buy something new? Do I hold out for the next level?

314
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:22,348
And for me, this is where I started to realize that I had not just solved some problems,

315
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:25,470
I had kind of created some emotion within the game.

316
00:26:26,254 --> 00:26:29,456
In a sense, the players were feeling a bit worried, a bit panicked,

317
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:32,297
that maybe they wouldn't be able to have enough,

318
00:26:33,037 --> 00:26:36,459
that maybe they'd have to grind, or maybe they'd have to complete some more quests.

319
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:40,901
And at that point, for me, that's what role-playing games are all about, right?

320
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:43,602
That's where you're not really just pushing buttons,

321
00:26:43,622 --> 00:26:46,663
that's where you're there inside the world, inside the character's mind,

322
00:26:46,703 --> 00:26:48,884
trying to figure out what is the next best thing.

323
00:26:50,005 --> 00:26:53,046
So, while visualizing the data was a large step forward

324
00:26:53,066 --> 00:26:54,947
in predicting how pricing was going to find...

325
00:26:55,454 --> 00:26:57,035
or affect the player's progression,

326
00:26:57,655 --> 00:26:59,496
in addition to all these other things I learned,

327
00:26:59,696 --> 00:27:01,817
I found the curve had other uses as well.

328
00:27:03,098 --> 00:27:06,019
For instance, by pre-calculating the coefficients

329
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,400
and storing these data in a table,

330
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:11,662
I was able to procedurally generate these curves at runtime.

331
00:27:12,602 --> 00:27:14,343
Now, instead of simply visualizing

332
00:27:14,403 --> 00:27:16,984
how a set of custom data points fit into my curve,

333
00:27:17,745 --> 00:27:20,146
this functionality actually allowed me to generate

334
00:27:20,486 --> 00:27:23,788
the infinite set of points that fit the curve exactly.

335
00:27:25,515 --> 00:27:31,899
Now only did this change simplify my design process, but by auto-generating content, I

336
00:27:31,939 --> 00:27:36,903
eliminated hundreds of existing bugs and prevented all new bugs from appearing.

337
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:42,812
I had been pouring over thousands of hardline coded values in XML, and now I was able to

338
00:27:42,872 --> 00:27:44,392
remove this data completely.

339
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:50,014
A process that reduced load times and decreased the footprint of every item in memory.

340
00:27:50,914 --> 00:27:58,336
An upgrade that saves me, personally, countless hours of overtime during crunch and a very

341
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:00,196
critical time during the project.

342
00:28:02,456 --> 00:28:05,257
Now, having won multiple awards for the game of the year.

343
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:11,884
The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is undoubtedly an example of creative expertise, but that's

344
00:28:11,944 --> 00:28:14,445
not to say that the game was shipped without problems.

345
00:28:15,206 --> 00:28:18,567
Let's face it, all games have bugs present in them.

346
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:20,187
It's just the nature of what we do.

347
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:25,969
But with open world design, there are a lot of systems, both large and small, that aren't

348
00:28:26,069 --> 00:28:27,710
present in the average game.

349
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:34,700
Many times these systems must perform across hundreds of hours with frequent interactions

350
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,281
between them.

351
00:28:35,942 --> 00:28:41,249
So if any parts are incorrectly placed or implemented, glitches will be prevalent in

352
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:41,550
the game.

353
00:28:43,313 --> 00:28:46,754
For instance, not long after The Witcher 3 was released,

354
00:28:47,274 --> 00:28:49,954
many of us on the team started scouring the internet

355
00:28:50,315 --> 00:28:53,035
and social media channels for issues and exploits

356
00:28:53,355 --> 00:28:54,456
that we might have missed.

357
00:28:55,336 --> 00:28:57,316
And it seemed like every single morning,

358
00:28:57,876 --> 00:28:59,897
I'd come in and there'd be another conversation

359
00:28:59,957 --> 00:29:02,818
at the water cooler about some hilarious video

360
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:04,378
or a hack that players found,

361
00:29:04,898 --> 00:29:07,699
where some additional conversation would go by

362
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:10,320
and we'd start talking about how to approach the fix.

363
00:29:11,598 --> 00:29:16,621
Unfortunately, a majority of the forums and videos were focused on a number of economic

364
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:21,703
exploits with my design that allowed players to quickly build up their bank accounts.

365
00:29:22,682 --> 00:29:26,966
Now the first method involved slaughtering cows in the starting area of White Orchard

366
00:29:27,006 --> 00:29:28,126
for their valuable hides.

367
00:29:29,127 --> 00:29:35,412
A source function, as we all understand now, the cows, were actually set to infinitely

368
00:29:35,472 --> 00:29:40,316
respawn to ensure that from a level design perspective, the player would always arrive

369
00:29:40,356 --> 00:29:43,978
into the village and see a very healthy community full of animals and people.

370
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:47,241
with no limitations placed on that situation.

371
00:29:47,801 --> 00:29:51,163
This actually just created a situation where it was only a matter of time

372
00:29:51,224 --> 00:29:53,945
before the players would collect and sell enough resources

373
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:57,588
to destabilize the economy in a very early stage of the game.

374
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:00,270
What I think The Witcher did right here

375
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,411
was not only to resolve the exploit,

376
00:30:03,232 --> 00:30:04,212
I think that's a given.

377
00:30:05,008 --> 00:30:07,489
what I feel was extraordinary is how it was done.

378
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:11,972
See, following the patch, if players are caught exploring

379
00:30:11,992 --> 00:30:13,393
this exploit,

380
00:30:13,953 --> 00:30:15,354
the cowhide problem that is,

381
00:30:15,374 --> 00:30:18,096
uh... well, let's just watch.

382
00:30:59,195 --> 00:31:04,737
I think that was actually a fairly common experience. In case you don't know, it has

383
00:31:04,777 --> 00:31:10,759
multiple names. This one was a Chort, and it actually had somewhat of a cow modeling

384
00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:15,420
on it, so what we were able to do is kind of reutilize an existing boss asset from later

385
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:15,880
in the game.

386
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,641
and bring it in to where players were generally quite feeble.

387
00:31:20,582 --> 00:31:24,763
So having something that might have been, you know, 7 or 10 levels higher than you,

388
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:28,384
all of a sudden became something where it was quite a penalty.

389
00:31:28,444 --> 00:31:31,825
In fact, it would just chase you down and kill you no matter where you went.

390
00:31:32,646 --> 00:31:38,091
And what I found was that this solution not only fixes the bug,

391
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:42,455
it penalizes the player in this way that is fun.

392
00:31:44,517 --> 00:31:46,399
In a way, it's almost like this bonus feature.

393
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:50,543
People who cheated get this unlock for this special content.

394
00:31:51,124 --> 00:31:53,626
And they probably just played last night,

395
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:56,689
hit the upgrade button, download the content patch.

396
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:03,312
all of a sudden came back for the regular payday and ended up losing very quickly.

397
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:07,714
I lovingly named the Bovine Defense Force Initiative.

398
00:32:08,315 --> 00:32:11,376
It was probably the most beloved bug I've ever fixed

399
00:32:12,336 --> 00:32:15,538
and resulted in a lot of appreciation from the community.

400
00:32:15,758 --> 00:32:16,578
So that was a lot of fun.

401
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,941
Similarly, in the first expansion, Hearts of Stone, any player who took part in the

402
00:32:23,001 --> 00:32:27,763
questionable money-making tactics might have been surprised to get a little visit from

403
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:30,345
a tax collector by the name Walthamore Middy.

404
00:32:31,865 --> 00:32:37,448
You see, Walthamore Middy knows about your undocumented income and quickly explains that

405
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:41,150
he's heard reports of Geralt quickly coming into large sums of wealth.

406
00:32:42,344 --> 00:32:45,185
to maintain the Witcher style players are familiar with,

407
00:32:45,845 --> 00:32:49,626
they're actually given a choice to make when these accusations are raised

408
00:32:49,786 --> 00:32:54,167
regarding their behavior. For example, you can tell the tax collector you know

409
00:32:54,267 --> 00:32:56,167
nothing about these accusations or

410
00:32:56,687 --> 00:32:59,808
you can admit to having participated. I don't wanna

411
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:03,649
give away anything for anybody hasn't played this content, so I'll just stop there.

412
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:08,030
Again, what I feel the Witcher did right here was not only

413
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,170
identify the bug, they listen to the community.

414
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:20,478
and watching what they'd done, they came on and solved that problem in a way that also enriches the player's story

415
00:33:20,939 --> 00:33:27,686
with a bit of humor, an engaging plot twist, and a simple decision, and some meaningful outcome,

416
00:33:28,167 --> 00:33:32,672
which I think are all basics and fundamentals to creating a great RPG.

417
00:33:34,852 --> 00:33:37,953
Along with this list of bug fixes and minor feature improvements,

418
00:33:38,773 --> 00:33:42,855
the Hearts of Stone expansion introduces a powerful new type of craftsman,

419
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:44,636
known as the Runewright.

420
00:33:46,837 --> 00:33:51,339
When we first met to discuss concepts regarding how to expand the base game,

421
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:56,481
we had been spending so much time fixing things, you know, it was a real chance to

422
00:33:56,521 --> 00:33:58,803
sit back and consider something fresh and new.

423
00:34:00,124 --> 00:34:05,169
We quickly arrived back to this original concept that we had, but just never had a chance to implement.

424
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,792
It was called the RuneWords.

425
00:34:08,793 --> 00:34:13,097
And the idea is that because you set all these runes into the blade,

426
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:21,266
instead of just some sockets that we have to use in the inventory to make it explainable and easy to handle,

427
00:34:21,746 --> 00:34:27,107
In the story, you know, we see this picture of Geralt as he is walking iconically out

428
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:32,509
and his witcher power is like surging through the blade and these runes are coming to life

429
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:34,409
with witcher sign magic, right?

430
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:39,811
It's a really, really cool concept that we just didn't have a chance to really realize

431
00:34:39,991 --> 00:34:41,071
as we had hoped.

432
00:34:42,191 --> 00:34:46,573
And with this feature, maybe this was our chance.

433
00:34:48,369 --> 00:34:56,834
In order to unlock powerful buffs and add to their combat abilities, it was clear that we were all excited to finally put this mechanic into the game.

434
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:06,800
And while working through several versions of the design, unfortunately, there's a bit of disagreement regarding how exactly we'd like to see the system play out.

435
00:35:08,369 --> 00:35:25,526
Also, while we were continuing to iterate on this design, I was receiving a lot of feedback from both QA and still the online community that more players were completing the game with an excess of something like 20 or 40,000 extra crowns, and they had no way of spending the money.

436
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:36,631
Too many. This sounded kind of like a bug or something that in some way was an indication that there was still an imbalance players were exploiting.

437
00:35:37,191 --> 00:35:42,193
But to be honest, I wasn't convinced. With that in mind, what's happening here?

438
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:52,596
See, one of the problems with balancing open world economies is that even if the system is statistically balanced, there's this additional layer of level design to consider.

439
00:35:53,696 --> 00:35:58,057
With that in mind, you've got multiple people working on the experience.

440
00:35:58,097 --> 00:36:00,657
You have multiple reasons that they're touching the content.

441
00:36:00,697 --> 00:36:03,078
Some people are placing it for gameplay perspective,

442
00:36:03,658 --> 00:36:06,058
making sure that the player has extra things to do,

443
00:36:06,518 --> 00:36:09,259
making sure the world feels alive and interactive.

444
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:12,899
Others, they go through from a purely aesthetic sense.

445
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:16,920
They're placing containers and unlockables and rare chests

446
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,941
because it looks right and it fits the environment and makes it feel real.

447
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:27,260
Other players, they're filling the world with quest content that's going to reward the player

448
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,822
from these challenges and from the time that they've spent.

449
00:36:30,743 --> 00:36:35,547
All of these things coming together ends up being very difficult to manage because everybody,

450
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:36,768
in a sense, is right.

451
00:36:37,649 --> 00:36:42,273
They all have this reason to be placing this content in the world.

452
00:36:43,274 --> 00:36:45,274
But also, that wasn't just the issue.

453
00:36:45,294 --> 00:36:54,418
The real issue here, I think, is that we, as designers, have no way of predicting what type of player that we're going to get.

454
00:36:54,658 --> 00:36:59,759
And by that I mean, like, how much of this content that we're creating are they going to pursue?

455
00:37:00,882 --> 00:37:05,464
Are they more of a casual player who's only focused on getting through the game, or more

456
00:37:05,504 --> 00:37:10,387
of a hardcore completionist who will seek out every last reward, place of power, and

457
00:37:10,447 --> 00:37:14,109
lootable container in the region before advancing on to the next quest?

458
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,130
The problem is, we don't know.

459
00:37:17,231 --> 00:37:19,492
The question then is, how do you deal with it?

460
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,994
Because we want everyone to have fun.

461
00:37:23,228 --> 00:37:31,856
That's clear, right? It's decided early on that whatever we do, the content kind of has to be based around places where the player is going to automatically be.

462
00:37:31,897 --> 00:37:43,667
We want casual players to enjoy the looting process and leveling up and finding upgrades and unlocking cool pieces of armor just as much as the hardcore players that are specifically there to find them.

463
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:53,536
So for those that put in the time, this resulted in a tendency to over-reward the player.

464
00:37:54,617 --> 00:37:58,881
That if they pick up even a portion of what we've placed along the quest locations,

465
00:37:59,422 --> 00:38:04,707
they'll actually have more money, gear, and upgrades than they would need to finish the game.

466
00:38:04,747 --> 00:38:07,990
In fact, they would have plenty to continue playing well beyond the end of the game.

467
00:38:09,012 --> 00:38:17,500
And with that in mind, we need an economic drain to start preparing the player for what

468
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,162
was going to come in Hearts of Stone.

469
00:38:19,222 --> 00:38:24,326
We needed to take away some of this advantage that they had, but also maybe provide a way

470
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:28,750
of augmenting their skills and abilities in a way that would compensate for the level

471
00:38:29,331 --> 00:38:30,832
32 content that we were going to drop on them.

472
00:38:32,328 --> 00:38:35,630
And that's when it was suggested that we would combine these two issues

473
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,971
into one big new feature called the Rune Rite.

474
00:38:40,132 --> 00:38:43,933
The Rune Rite is actually something that must be earned by completing a quest

475
00:38:44,674 --> 00:38:47,415
and can then be improved by investing in new equipment.

476
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:54,355
This will in turn unlock more powerful enchantments, but you need some serious cash to progress through the system.

477
00:38:54,936 --> 00:39:02,962
Because, I don't know, looking at it in a variety of different comments, that 20,000 to 40,000, we kind of put this limit at maybe about 30,000

478
00:39:04,063 --> 00:39:08,307
that most people would have, or maybe some slight grinding in order to attain.

479
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:13,952
So as an example, the level one, where you're just investing in this beggar in the street,

480
00:39:14,292 --> 00:39:19,036
you're giving him $5,000 and some quest pieces to open up a shop.

481
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:24,140
Now, if you want to engage the level two content, that will take a little bit more investment

482
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:24,661
through another $10,000.

483
00:39:26,014 --> 00:39:29,395
and finally you want that top tier level three enchantment

484
00:39:29,635 --> 00:39:33,076
it's gonna cost you another fifteen thousand for a total of thirty thousand

485
00:39:33,116 --> 00:39:33,496
dollars

486
00:39:34,516 --> 00:39:38,157
uh... surprisingly uh... most of the players that i've seen

487
00:39:39,258 --> 00:39:39,838
start to

488
00:39:39,858 --> 00:39:44,399
uh... say whether or not it was worth it and i think what's interesting is in a

489
00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:49,100
way we hit that mark very very closely most people had just enough money

490
00:39:49,401 --> 00:39:53,142
to immediately go through so that by the time the new DLC was released

491
00:39:53,502 --> 00:39:55,362
they were kind of starting where they should be

492
00:39:57,874 --> 00:40:01,596
One of the things I think the Witcher did right here was to make enchantments free.

493
00:40:02,456 --> 00:40:05,197
That, considering the initial investment was quite costly,

494
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:10,199
this is logical in the story as well as the gameplay.

495
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,501
The Runewight, in a sense, owes Geralt this debt of gratitude

496
00:40:14,561 --> 00:40:19,163
for putting him back in business and restoring his ability to craft all these enchantments.

497
00:40:19,743 --> 00:40:23,265
But more importantly, I find this encourages the player to experiment

498
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,926
with all of these new abilities that they've just acquired.

499
00:40:28,435 --> 00:40:31,917
Now, when we set out to design the Witcher 3 Blood and Wine expansion,

500
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:38,141
we wanted to take you on a fantastic journey that would go far beyond the war-ravaged villages of Gnomon's Land

501
00:40:38,481 --> 00:40:41,163
and the stormy beachfronts of the Skellige Islands.

502
00:40:42,644 --> 00:40:46,367
Taken directly from the pages of the Witcher dark fantasy novels,

503
00:40:46,427 --> 00:40:53,151
the final chapter of Geralt's saga welcomes you to the Nilfgaardian realm of Tassant,

504
00:40:53,772 --> 00:40:56,353
the enchanting and mysterious land of wine.

505
00:40:57,274 --> 00:41:01,518
Heavily inspired by the beauty and the pageantry of the French-Italian countryside,

506
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:07,443
Beauclair, the region's capital, blends rolling hills, winding roads, charming villas,

507
00:41:07,723 --> 00:41:11,326
and intriguing new characters to create a colorful and vibrant landscape

508
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:15,770
unlike anything that we've seen in Hearts of Stone or The Wild Hunt.

509
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:22,570
Now from an RPG perspective, this was a huge opportunity for us to add something unique as well.

510
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:28,752
Reports we had received from our internal QA department were identifying concerns with character progression,

511
00:41:28,792 --> 00:41:34,113
where players were unable to use the ability points and inventory items that they had acquired.

512
00:41:35,033 --> 00:41:40,554
Also, feedback collected from the Witcher Online community had resulted in a list of requests

513
00:41:41,034 --> 00:41:45,695
for improvements to the user interface and new gear that would augment character abilities.

514
00:41:46,657 --> 00:41:51,044
After almost a year of the game's initial release, we felt it was time to tackle some

515
00:41:51,084 --> 00:41:56,253
of these bigger issues and, as it was the final chapter in Geralt's story, maybe have

516
00:41:56,273 --> 00:41:57,294
a little fun along the way.

517
00:41:59,368 --> 00:42:03,070
And with that in mind, along with its new region and mysterious storyline,

518
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:07,992
we decided that Blood & Wine should introduce some all-new role-playing game mechanics as well.

519
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:13,315
Starting with the user interface, we saw a lot of improvements,

520
00:42:13,415 --> 00:42:17,197
both with manageability and improvements to the crafting system,

521
00:42:17,237 --> 00:42:24,321
where the player is able to add a variety of components without having to leave that interface.

522
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:35,895
We also added a new mutation system which, when used in conjunction with other ability buffs, adds an entirely new dimension to the way that you play.

523
00:42:38,165 --> 00:42:59,631
We also added a brand new design to the items where as we were placing things through the world it became clear again with quest designers needing support, with arts needing support, with gameplay needing support, we needed a chance and a rule set maybe to keep all this content placing consistently.

524
00:43:01,885 --> 00:43:07,253
Finally, we started looking at an all-new dye system where we were giving players the

525
00:43:07,313 --> 00:43:10,178
ability to customize the color of the Witcher's armor sets.

526
00:43:13,054 --> 00:43:17,196
Perhaps the biggest change of these was the mutation system.

527
00:43:18,317 --> 00:43:20,298
It introduces a new RPG design,

528
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:26,020
and while this mechanic was originally added to compensate for the expansion's high-level requirements,

529
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:30,482
we ultimately found that it was able to address a lot of other concerns as well.

530
00:43:31,723 --> 00:43:34,344
Primarily, the first is related to character progression.

531
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,773
See, as players run around the Witcher's vast open world,

532
00:43:39,174 --> 00:43:41,857
they encounter a variety of different monsters and enemies,

533
00:43:42,237 --> 00:43:44,059
some of which are extremely powerful

534
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:48,143
and require players to achieve a high level

535
00:43:48,243 --> 00:43:49,284
in order to defeat them.

536
00:43:50,145 --> 00:43:51,947
Encountering these types of situations

537
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,049
encourages the players to progress

538
00:43:54,409 --> 00:43:56,271
in order to overcome the challenges

539
00:43:56,691 --> 00:43:58,353
and acquire the rewards that await.

540
00:44:00,175 --> 00:44:04,799
This is one of the things that I feel sets the Witcher apart from some of the other RPGs on the market.

541
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,584
See, instead of increasing the strength of each monster and enemy,

542
00:44:10,285 --> 00:44:17,151
based on the level of the player, the difficulty is fixed and at times can overwhelm even the most talented Witcher.

543
00:44:18,252 --> 00:44:24,839
The key takeaway here is that to ensure the player actually feels like they're getting

544
00:44:24,919 --> 00:44:28,482
stronger there's some things that we want to be careful to deliver.

545
00:44:29,643 --> 00:44:35,609
The problem with continually scaling enemies is that by basing them on the player's level

546
00:44:35,649 --> 00:44:39,233
the player may never actually feel that they're progressing.

547
00:44:40,034 --> 00:44:45,986
that as that same challenge progresses, they're progressing and you get this kind of arms race

548
00:44:46,047 --> 00:44:51,198
where you end up with a very flat and normalized experience as the game runs through.

549
00:44:53,180 --> 00:45:05,111
In The Witcher, character progression is limited by a combination of experience and ability points that limit the games that they complete, story quests, side quests, and witcher contracts.

550
00:45:05,972 --> 00:45:15,360
In the beginning, this limitation forces the player to plan and carefully select its abilities in order to build strengths that focus on their particular playstyle.

551
00:45:16,595 --> 00:45:21,198
Unfortunately, based on the feedback that we had received, as players were increasing

552
00:45:21,238 --> 00:45:24,240
a level, this progression curve was actually peaking too early.

553
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:29,163
This was leading to a disappointment in the endgame, where players were feeling little

554
00:45:29,404 --> 00:45:30,845
to no progression at all.

555
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,661
The issue was actually a flaw in the way that the skill tree was designed.

556
00:45:37,302 --> 00:45:41,983
In this example, you can see here that once all the skill points have been allocated,

557
00:45:42,103 --> 00:45:47,125
once all the skill slots have been filled, and their abilities maxed out, the player

558
00:45:47,165 --> 00:45:49,685
has no motivation to continue leveling up.

559
00:45:50,786 --> 00:45:55,867
And this resulting effect is that as players progress, they will continue to accumulate

560
00:45:55,927 --> 00:45:59,428
ability points that cannot be allocated within the skill tree.

561
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:04,663
Also, if you look along both sides of the skill tree, you'll see that four monster mutagens

562
00:46:06,004 --> 00:46:07,925
all are suffering from the same problem.

563
00:46:09,026 --> 00:46:12,388
These slots have been filled and with no way to continue utilizing them.

564
00:46:13,008 --> 00:46:17,911
As Geralt continues to defeat boss-type monsters and collect these powerful items,

565
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:21,973
they will just simply continue to stack up inside the player's inventory.

566
00:46:23,074 --> 00:46:26,576
And to resolve these issues, we came up with the mutation system.

567
00:46:27,723 --> 00:46:33,767
See, mutations are powerful abilities that can be added to Geralt's skill set in addition

568
00:46:33,827 --> 00:46:35,408
to his regular character skills.

569
00:46:36,589 --> 00:46:43,053
With 12 mutations in total, and each one embodying a very specific skill type, whether it be

570
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:48,176
combat, alchemy, science, or a blend of these types, the players are able to choose how

571
00:46:48,216 --> 00:46:49,276
they progress once again.

572
00:46:51,055 --> 00:46:56,139
In order to activate a mutation, it actually has to be first researched, which also costs

573
00:46:56,179 --> 00:47:00,982
an increasing amount of both skill points and greater mutagens.

574
00:47:02,003 --> 00:47:06,906
Additionally, these mutations build on each other, which focuses players to unlock the

575
00:47:06,966 --> 00:47:11,770
lower mutations before advancing to the more advanced options that are made available.

576
00:47:12,625 --> 00:47:17,286
and although they are labeled as game-changing abilities with effects like free respawn on

577
00:47:17,346 --> 00:47:21,447
death several could be considered more of a game breaker.

578
00:47:22,427 --> 00:47:27,849
And in fact one of my personal favorites is a freezing effect that it adds to the art

579
00:47:27,889 --> 00:47:32,810
sign ability where either they're frozen or they completely explode and like frozen jibs

580
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:34,190
and fly all over the place.

581
00:47:34,490 --> 00:47:35,451
It's a real blast.

582
00:47:38,933 --> 00:47:44,499
Finally, when the mutation is equipped, the Strengthened Synapses ability also expands

583
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:51,485
Gero's skill tree with one additional ability slot for every two mutations that he researches.

584
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:57,480
Putting all of these things together, the mutation system turned into a massive step

585
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:03,025
forward in regards to resolving our issues with character progression, as well as fixing

586
00:48:03,325 --> 00:48:06,247
and making more fun inside the player's skill tree.

587
00:48:07,228 --> 00:48:12,633
We were able to eliminate concerns with unused inventory by providing the player new opportunities

588
00:48:12,793 --> 00:48:14,835
to spend the ability points they had collected.

589
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:20,652
And by focusing on monster mutagens, we were able to expand the need once again for the

590
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:26,016
alchemy system and further encourage the player to invest time in the monster hunt mechanic.

591
00:48:27,513 --> 00:48:31,758
In addition to resolving these issues, this decision provides the player with new motivation

592
00:48:32,298 --> 00:48:37,704
to continue leveling up, but also, importantly, it further immerses the player within the

593
00:48:37,824 --> 00:48:44,251
Witcher's Monster Slayer fantasy, making it a perfect addition to the existing roleplaying

594
00:48:44,311 --> 00:48:45,653
experience that we had created.

595
00:48:48,674 --> 00:48:53,419
Now considering this vast change in dynamics that Blood & Wine brings to The Witcher 3,

596
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:58,064
we felt it would be a lot of fun to bring some of that color into the crafting system.

597
00:48:59,165 --> 00:49:04,871
One of the last big features to ever be added to the game, this introduces an all new coloring

598
00:49:05,412 --> 00:49:09,696
mechanic that presents some surprises for multiple departments on the team.

599
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:16,578
See, one of the biggest requests we were getting from player community was for additional customization of Geralt.

600
00:49:17,379 --> 00:49:21,685
Considering many RPGs let you design the protagonist of the story from the outset,

601
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:26,351
a lot of players were feeling discouraged that they weren't given more options throughout the game.

602
00:49:28,225 --> 00:49:34,127
While everybody was on board with the idea, there was a technical issue involved with how player armors were designed.

603
00:49:35,187 --> 00:49:42,389
Instead of using two channels to separate the colors, the same process that we use to randomize NPC appearances,

604
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:52,212
character artists had made a very early decision to focus on delivering high quality assets that would only use a single channel process.

605
00:49:54,014 --> 00:49:58,657
This required me to modify several code paths that had not been touched in years,

606
00:49:58,817 --> 00:50:05,440
which presents a lot of concerns as we no longer had an in-house expert to consult if things go wrong.

607
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:11,543
Additionally, new textures and materials would have to be created, not only per armor,

608
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:15,986
but per armor piece before these new code changes could take effect.

609
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:24,199
But putting together a prototype, I was able to finally modify the Griffon armor and demonstrate

610
00:50:24,219 --> 00:50:29,063
the quality and number of new assets that we could generate from the game base mesh.

611
00:50:31,156 --> 00:50:36,819
The best part, I feel, is that once released, not only is this a huge step forward in providing

612
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:41,321
the player with a completely new level of customization that they had not yet known

613
00:50:41,361 --> 00:50:46,664
before, but playing with the different color sets, it seems clear that this is going to

614
00:50:46,704 --> 00:50:51,226
make the decision put in their hands.

615
00:50:51,266 --> 00:50:53,807
We're not just simply releasing these things.

616
00:50:54,608 --> 00:50:58,535
and allowing them to purchase one or to decide which one that they want.

617
00:50:58,876 --> 00:51:01,901
This is something where they're running out into the world deciding

618
00:51:02,382 --> 00:51:06,449
how do they want to expand even if they have one maybe they don't like

619
00:51:06,509 --> 00:51:07,311
mismatched armor.

620
00:51:07,795 --> 00:51:11,237
Maybe they want to get all of the dies in order to complete a full set.

621
00:51:11,257 --> 00:51:18,943
Then once they find them, it is possible to then go through along with some new technical improvements to the UI

622
00:51:18,963 --> 00:51:22,445
and actually apply these as they wish.

623
00:51:23,086 --> 00:51:30,851
We also include like a die remover, which if you did make a mistake or prefer to undie something or mix and match however you want,

624
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:34,374
that's also a mechanic that you can incorporate into your play.

625
00:51:35,455 --> 00:51:40,839
Also, this came with a new preview mode where you could present these colors on each mesh

626
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:44,082
individually before you actually apply them.

627
00:51:44,683 --> 00:51:49,847
And this was nice so that if you had the idea of mixing colors as I was just showing you,

628
00:51:50,007 --> 00:51:54,852
two or three different colors in a single armor set, this would allow you to see how

629
00:51:54,972 --> 00:51:57,514
each color plays out on each different piece of armor.

630
00:51:59,412 --> 00:52:05,057
You know, thinking back over all of these new features, for me, I'd say this one was my favorite.

631
00:52:06,118 --> 00:52:09,240
Unlike an ancestral sword that kind of deals more damage,

632
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:13,583
or a piece of relic armor that provides a greater resistance to injury,

633
00:52:14,184 --> 00:52:17,066
with no impact on player statistics whatsoever,

634
00:52:17,807 --> 00:52:20,149
this feature is all about experimentation.

635
00:52:20,829 --> 00:52:25,072
It's about having fun and realizing the player's story that they wish to tell.

636
00:52:26,176 --> 00:52:29,600
based on all of the community feedback we've received over the last year.

637
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:33,584
I think this game mechanic is one of the best decisions that we made.

638
00:52:34,204 --> 00:52:37,348
And a special thanks from all of us here at CD Projekt Red to you.

639
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,770
The best fans in the world. Thank you very much.

640
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:56,310
I think we have a few more minutes for any questions and answers that you guys would

641
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:56,791
like to do.

642
00:52:56,931 --> 00:52:59,072
Is everybody ready to get out of here?

643
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,421
We have a microphone going out.

644
00:53:22,087 --> 00:53:29,252
Hello, don't you think it's a problem if a player is so engaged and want to play all

645
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:35,275
additional content because it's so diverse and so well designed, he kind of gets punished

646
00:53:35,335 --> 00:53:39,878
by getting too much money, too much experience, making combat too easy?

647
00:53:43,413 --> 00:53:47,718
I do think that that's a problem. I think it's also kind of a reward.

648
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,724
In a sense the system's working exactly the way it's been designed, right?

649
00:53:52,964 --> 00:53:57,730
If you want to go out, you want to earn a lot of money, and you want to buy and craft a lot of equipment,

650
00:53:58,191 --> 00:53:59,772
this should give you an advantage.

651
00:54:00,433 --> 00:54:04,316
I do think that there's an option to place limits on the player,

652
00:54:05,397 --> 00:54:10,020
but a lot of people, you know, they've asked this question a lot actually.

653
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:16,024
A lot of them do want to simplify the system with maybe some systemic or procedural solution

654
00:54:16,084 --> 00:54:22,109
where perhaps, you know, if you're collecting equipment from a chest and you're too high level,

655
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:26,031
just like, you know, trying to collect experience on a lower level monster,

656
00:54:26,071 --> 00:54:27,172
you don't get anything.

657
00:54:27,252 --> 00:54:29,674
So maybe in this chest you don't get anything.

658
00:54:30,134 --> 00:54:37,137
And for me, I'm kind of this huge proponent of player agency where they should be allowed to do whatever they want

659
00:54:37,737 --> 00:54:42,299
and have that rewarded based on the level of challenge it took to acquire that.

660
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:46,942
And so if we were to start taking away that agency and saying they're just playing too good,

661
00:54:47,042 --> 00:54:52,664
or they're being penalized because they have enjoyed the game too much,

662
00:54:53,104 --> 00:54:56,766
I think that would actually complicate the situation even more.

663
00:54:57,658 --> 00:55:04,617
So a lot of different things to consider, a lot of moving parts, but I agree, yeah, some limitations could be placed there.

664
00:55:12,944 --> 00:55:16,386
Hello, my name is George and I just wanted to ask you because

665
00:55:16,406 --> 00:55:21,028
a lot of systems you just introduced, like the mutation system,

666
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,749
indeed helps in de-alizing unused points.

667
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:28,051
My question is why did you allow the player to have access to that system

668
00:55:28,652 --> 00:55:32,093
on a particular quest? Because at the beginning of Blood and Wine expansion

669
00:55:32,794 --> 00:55:35,975
I was feeling at the beginning that I keep my points for no reason and

670
00:55:36,275 --> 00:55:38,917
somewhere in the middle I just have to spend them somewhere because

671
00:55:38,937 --> 00:55:41,858
I just found that hidden alchemy that unlocks the system.

672
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:44,863
Why did you introduce it there and not in the beginning?

673
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:52,478
I think there was really no choice unless we forced it upon you.

674
00:55:53,652 --> 00:56:00,797
And while that's possible, I think this is a reward for players that are more interested

675
00:56:01,398 --> 00:56:05,581
if you remember that slide we talked about, like the casual versus the hardcore

676
00:56:06,021 --> 00:56:12,226
that I feel like instead of just supporting the hardcore, this is actually supporting maybe like to the mid-range

677
00:56:12,767 --> 00:56:17,250
where chances are the casual player won't be interested in this mechanic anyways.

678
00:56:18,171 --> 00:56:19,731
Even if you gave it to them, they'd say,

679
00:56:19,771 --> 00:56:21,032
okay, well, I've got skill points.

680
00:56:21,072 --> 00:56:22,652
I don't know if I have time.

681
00:56:22,692 --> 00:56:25,093
I just want to get back to this really great thing

682
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:26,694
where I'm having sex on a unicorn.

683
00:56:26,734 --> 00:56:27,494
This is awesome.

684
00:56:27,574 --> 00:56:32,576
And, you know, I don't know that that would have made such an impact.

685
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:40,060
And yet, for players perhaps like yourself, you did feel that moment where then all of

686
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:45,783
a sudden you had all these skill points and you felt that reward when you did unlock that

687
00:56:45,843 --> 00:56:46,183
quest.

688
00:56:46,223 --> 00:56:51,406
So whether it came too early or too late, the emotional payout was there.

689
00:56:51,966 --> 00:56:56,028
And I think that's something that you wouldn't want to jeopardize however you would go about

690
00:56:56,129 --> 00:56:56,589
fixing it.

691
00:57:08,292 --> 00:57:09,693
I have some questions in the back here.

692
00:57:17,317 --> 00:57:23,140
Hi. You talk about removing resources from your economy.

693
00:57:23,801 --> 00:57:26,262
How do you deal with the problem where potentially, say for example,

694
00:57:26,302 --> 00:57:29,544
someone buys lots of crossbow bolts and then wastes them on an enemy

695
00:57:29,584 --> 00:57:31,645
without getting a proper reward from that?

696
00:57:32,585 --> 00:57:34,406
How do you deal with that potential problem?

697
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:37,568
Yeah, we actually have basically two types of ammo.

698
00:57:38,598 --> 00:57:40,671
uh... where you have your standard bolt

699
00:57:41,764 --> 00:57:44,105
And you also have kind of an underwater harpoon.

700
00:57:45,286 --> 00:57:49,008
And both of these are not going to do as much damage.

701
00:57:49,668 --> 00:57:52,830
You can, in a sense, craft some legendary versions

702
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:57,032
of the exploding bolt, which is really, really cool looking.

703
00:57:57,072 --> 00:57:58,713
It does a massive amount of damage.

704
00:57:59,174 --> 00:58:00,655
It's a little expensive to make.

705
00:58:01,235 --> 00:58:05,037
And they have limited capacity, which

706
00:58:05,077 --> 00:58:07,839
I feel enhances the skill-based nature of the game.

707
00:58:08,599 --> 00:58:11,160
Now you do have to save them for the right moment.

708
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,442
You do have to pick the quality of exchange

709
00:58:14,502 --> 00:58:17,543
so that you're getting the most out of your investment.

710
00:58:17,683 --> 00:58:19,604
And of course, if you ever run out,

711
00:58:19,964 --> 00:58:21,865
you go back to the lower damage version

712
00:58:21,905 --> 00:58:23,366
of which you have an infinite supply.

713
00:58:28,608 --> 00:58:29,408
Any other questions?

714
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:32,190
No?

715
00:58:34,391 --> 00:58:34,731
Okay.

716
00:58:35,231 --> 00:58:36,311
Oh, wait, one more.

717
00:58:44,591 --> 00:58:51,981
Hello, my name is Marie. I wanted to ask about the trophies because I still have all these trophies in my storage

718
00:58:52,401 --> 00:58:54,003
Did you ever thought about system?

719
00:58:54,824 --> 00:58:55,885
Where player can put them?

720
00:58:58,877 --> 00:59:02,281
I, you know, I think that's only a matter of time issue.

721
00:59:03,243 --> 00:59:07,067
A lot of these things that you're talking about

722
00:59:07,087 --> 00:59:12,134
are things that weren't a part or a concern as we were just trying to finish the game.

723
00:59:13,235 --> 00:59:17,560
Along with the DLCs, we did expand these concepts and, in blood and wine,

724
00:59:18,401 --> 00:59:23,964
We have Cover Bianco, which is the new home that Geralt it kind of settles down in

725
00:59:25,004 --> 00:59:29,266
You know if I had a chance to go back in and revisit some more content

726
00:59:29,646 --> 00:59:32,588
That would be an opportunity to add more value

727
00:59:33,388 --> 00:59:37,870
So that as the players upgrading this, you know, and they're getting these ability bonuses

728
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:42,032
You know, there's just one more reason for it to be called home

729
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:49,051
Okay, anyone else?

730
00:59:51,875 --> 00:59:53,056
All right, well, thank you so much

731
00:59:53,096 --> 00:59:54,218
for your time today, everybody.

732
00:59:54,658 --> 00:59:55,379
Have a great GDC.
