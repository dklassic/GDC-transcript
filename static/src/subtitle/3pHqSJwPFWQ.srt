1
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:17,177
Hi, good morning, everyone. My name is Vanessa Nairko. My pronouns are she, her. Today I'm

2
00:00:17,197 --> 00:00:22,261
wearing a blue blazer, a black shirt with my studio's logo on it, black pants, and white

3
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:27,165
sneakers. I'm a senior story producer over at The Coalition, and I'm here today to talk

4
00:00:27,205 --> 00:00:31,288
to you about narrative moments on a budget and how you construct your storytelling dollars

5
00:00:31,408 --> 00:00:32,569
across the moments that matter.

6
00:00:34,997 --> 00:00:37,918
But first, a little bit about what I do and the studio that I'm from.

7
00:00:38,478 --> 00:00:41,519
So story is a big umbrella, and as a senior story producer,

8
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,781
I drive the elements and the teams that craft an immersive storytelling experiences.

9
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:49,402
So that's everything from the inception and ownership of casting and writing,

10
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:53,143
to the content teams that work together to develop the cohesive narrative

11
00:00:53,424 --> 00:00:56,405
between cinematics, narrative design, and in-game sequences.

12
00:00:57,065 --> 00:01:00,726
I also work with a phenomenal team of directors, leads, and content developers

13
00:01:01,046 --> 00:01:02,687
to bring great stories to life.

14
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,430
And I hail from the Coalition Studio that is based in Vancouver, Canada.

15
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,511
It's the home of the Gears of War franchise

16
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:12,551
and a flagship first-party studio for Xbox Game Studios.

17
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:15,872
So, now that I've told you a little story about myself,

18
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:17,932
I want to start by introducing you to another

19
00:01:18,352 --> 00:01:20,313
that ends with a tricky question.

20
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:25,574
But first, we begin where all great stories do, at the beginning.

21
00:01:26,474 --> 00:01:30,755
So, storytelling in game dev has an almost impossible puzzle to solve.

22
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:34,350
We need to build worlds and stories that are rich enough to draw players in,

23
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,397
get our own visions across, excite returning gamers, and retain new ones.

24
00:01:39,178 --> 00:01:42,684
All while delivering, hopefully, on time and on budget.

25
00:01:43,779 --> 00:01:48,220
And because creativity knows no bounds, it's sometimes very easy to stay in our blue sky

26
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,721
stage of thinking, especially when it comes to narrative.

27
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:54,582
Because not only do we want to tell great stories, we need to see them through to the

28
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:54,802
end.

29
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:56,643
They need to feel satisfying.

30
00:01:56,983 --> 00:02:00,984
Some of them may even have branching dialogue, with complex character arcs and multiple themes,

31
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:04,706
and to be honest, we feel incredibly attached to the stories that we make.

32
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:09,847
And as much as it's difficult to stop ourselves from listening to a great story, it's equally

33
00:02:09,887 --> 00:02:11,788
as hard to hold ourselves back from telling one.

34
00:02:13,043 --> 00:02:15,025
So it's true, storytelling in game dev

35
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:16,767
has a near impossible puzzle to solve.

36
00:02:17,507 --> 00:02:19,209
And I say near impossible because it's not

37
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:20,149
without a solution.

38
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,112
I'm sure all of us here are familiar with the old adage,

39
00:02:23,432 --> 00:02:24,733
games don't ship because they're done,

40
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:26,455
they ship because they have a deadline.

41
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:29,878
But the first part of the tricky question is this,

42
00:02:30,678 --> 00:02:32,119
what if we could change all that?

43
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,541
What if we could develop the stories we want

44
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:36,423
with a better control of what needs to stay in,

45
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:38,104
what needs to be whittled down,

46
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:40,687
and create great stories within the scope of our games

47
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:41,868
that we're immensely proud of?

48
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,283
Simply put, how do we tell great stories on a budget?

49
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:50,205
When everything is important, but time and budget is limited,

50
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:52,427
how can we empower developers with the support

51
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:55,088
they need to approach the complex decisions of how we

52
00:02:55,128 --> 00:02:56,809
choose to invest our narrative bandwidth?

53
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,111
In this talk, I hope to provide a foundational framework

54
00:03:00,392 --> 00:03:02,013
of how you can spend your narrative dollars

55
00:03:02,113 --> 00:03:03,354
across the stories you develop.

56
00:03:03,734 --> 00:03:05,955
Now, the simple act of making these methods

57
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:09,758
focuses decision-making in more productive and informed ways.

58
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:14,391
And this is going to be true for games of any scale and teams of any size,

59
00:03:14,932 --> 00:03:16,733
whether it's AAA or a new indie.

60
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:19,715
If your team is passionate about the stories that you want to tell,

61
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:23,457
you don't need millions of dollars or hundreds of devs to tell a great one.

62
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:27,380
It should be noted before I start this talk

63
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,781
that this is not a talk on how to write a great story.

64
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:33,023
This is a talk on how to prioritize your great stories

65
00:03:33,043 --> 00:03:35,005
so that it's told in the best way feasible.

66
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:37,891
And so why talk about this at all?

67
00:03:38,032 --> 00:03:38,792
Why is it important?

68
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,273
Because a great story, in its simplest form,

69
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:43,554
is one with a great beginning, middle, and end.

70
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:46,295
And since all games, regardless of the scale

71
00:03:46,315 --> 00:03:48,496
of your production, have budgets and deadlines,

72
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:51,377
when we fail to prioritize effectively delivering

73
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,658
the beginning, middle, and end of our story,

74
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,460
we fail to deliver a great story altogether,

75
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,121
regardless of how we try to make up for the lost time

76
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:01,702
or the lost effort later on in production.

77
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:06,024
So, that brings us back to our near impossible problem.

78
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:08,565
How do we tell great stories on a budget?

79
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:11,166
Well, first, we need to develop a framework.

80
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:14,288
We do this by identifying our core narrative beats,

81
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:16,490
clarifying our story-critical path,

82
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,372
and following what I like to call the 3-2-1 approach

83
00:04:19,472 --> 00:04:22,414
to empower decision makers and hold ourselves accountable.

84
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:25,416
This framework can be universal

85
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:27,237
and works to build a strong narrative budget

86
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:29,138
because all great stories start the same.

87
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:32,120
By first identifying our core narrative beats

88
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,341
and our story-critical path,

89
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:35,242
we're able to create the control center

90
00:04:35,282 --> 00:04:36,143
of our game's narrative.

91
00:04:36,974 --> 00:04:39,216
So let's dive into identifying these key terms

92
00:04:39,316 --> 00:04:40,937
as they'll set us up for creating our approach

93
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:42,278
for spreading our narrative dollars

94
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:44,080
across the moments that truly matter.

95
00:04:46,222 --> 00:04:47,543
First up, core narrative beats.

96
00:04:48,024 --> 00:04:49,485
So these are the foundational tenants

97
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:51,086
of the overall story through which

98
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,728
the story-critical path is weaved.

99
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:56,761
These are usually the most impactful story beats that are agreed upon at a high level,

100
00:04:57,081 --> 00:04:58,282
usually during pre-production.

101
00:04:58,822 --> 00:05:01,564
You can think of your core narrative beats sort of like your story pillars.

102
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:04,245
And while your story pillars can exist without cinematics

103
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:07,727
or whatever high-value narrative devices you're employing in your own game,

104
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:10,729
those high-value narrative devices should rarely exist

105
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:12,630
without the core narrative beats.

106
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:16,072
And this is usually because they're high-cost, meaning that they're high-investment,

107
00:05:16,352 --> 00:05:19,714
so you want to put them in the place that most players are likely to see them.

108
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:25,497
Next up is our story critical path, which are the moments of the game represented by

109
00:05:25,597 --> 00:05:30,040
missions or narrative devices that are pivotal to tying the main parts of your narrative

110
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,960
of the game together.

111
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:35,463
To put this another way, these are the elements of the story that if removed would either

112
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:40,286
make your overall narrative completely nonsensical or create a noticeable disconnect in your

113
00:05:40,326 --> 00:05:41,207
plot or gameplay.

114
00:05:41,847 --> 00:05:45,750
These are usually objectives along a chronological path that service the core narrative beats

115
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,171
and are sometimes referred to as the golden path.

116
00:05:50,675 --> 00:05:55,095
So I like visuals, so let's break this down to an example that I hope we all know and love, the Lion King.

117
00:05:55,736 --> 00:06:04,957
And if you have not seen the Lion King up until this point, I have to tell you that this is going to be a spoiler, and I am so sorry, but I hope you have seen the Lion King, or at least have read Hamlet.

118
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:08,158
So here... Oh, I'm so sorry.

119
00:06:09,058 --> 00:06:19,180
So here we see our core narrative beats that help guide the story, and then the story-critical path, which would include missions or gameplay, if the Lion King was a game, that are crucial to get from one narrative beat to the next.

120
00:06:20,282 --> 00:06:24,645
So for our core narrative beats, we have the iconic opening of the Circle of Life with

121
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:29,228
the giraffes and the antelopes, we have that classic image of Rafiki holding Simba up on

122
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:34,951
Pride Rock, we have the agonizing Mufasa falling into the stampede, all the way to us learning

123
00:06:34,971 --> 00:06:39,354
what it means to have no worries for the rest of our days, and of course, ending with Simba

124
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:41,315
becoming the titular Lion King.

125
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:45,836
But we also have the story critical path that ties it all together.

126
00:06:46,477 --> 00:06:50,260
For example, the movie needed to establish that Simba was next in line to be king.

127
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:51,822
He was a little bit naive.

128
00:06:52,262 --> 00:06:53,563
He didn't know that he needed to earn it.

129
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,025
He sort of just thought he deserved it.

130
00:06:55,405 --> 00:06:59,209
And we need to see why this happens because it propels Simba's overall fleet and then

131
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:01,791
subsequent Pride Rock plunging into chaos.

132
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:06,542
Similarly, Simba is need to be seen growing and learning, and us as the viewers need to

133
00:07:06,582 --> 00:07:08,343
see that there's some sort of passage of time.

134
00:07:09,084 --> 00:07:13,029
Lastly, we need to see that Simba has learned of Scar's tyrannous reign, which of course

135
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:18,374
propels the narrative to his penultimate return to Pride Rock, all for his confrontation with

136
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:19,315
Scar to make sense.

137
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:23,860
You remove these paths, and there's a noticeable disconnect in the story.

138
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:31,316
So with the core narrative beats and our story critical path in mind, let's talk about why

139
00:07:31,356 --> 00:07:33,517
this is important in establishing your narrative budget.

140
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,021
First, it generates a high level discussion.

141
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:42,904
If you're working on a game and you are super excited, you're eager, you've heard me say

142
00:07:42,944 --> 00:07:46,827
core narrative beats and story critical path at least a dozen times now, you rush to your

143
00:07:46,847 --> 00:07:49,629
stakeholders and they're just like, I do not agree.

144
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:52,191
These are not our core narrative beats or story critical path.

145
00:07:52,851 --> 00:07:55,513
That is probably one of the best things that could happen,

146
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:57,235
because now you know what it's not.

147
00:07:57,535 --> 00:08:00,138
You can now work on to the second step of aligning your teams

148
00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:01,299
on what's most important.

149
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:03,801
If they say, that's not what our core narrative beats are,

150
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:06,624
we can open a dialogue and discussion of, then what are they?

151
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:08,305
And then what are the most important links

152
00:08:08,345 --> 00:08:09,306
that hold it all together?

153
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:12,029
It's also going to keep us focused on what's important.

154
00:08:12,549 --> 00:08:16,253
As we go through the course of production, we're going to have many, many things get added,

155
00:08:16,754 --> 00:08:21,839
many, many, many, many things get added, with various scopes and various levels of importance.

156
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:24,662
This is going to keep us focused on what we prioritize.

157
00:08:25,162 --> 00:08:28,626
If something doesn't circle back to a core narrative beat or story-critical path,

158
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,670
we can now ask ourselves, how important is it really? How much should I invest?

159
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:36,168
And of course, it also holds us accountable to these decisions.

160
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:38,169
When we're adding an additional plot,

161
00:08:38,489 --> 00:08:41,050
or maybe we're trying to assess what needs to be cut,

162
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,111
we can again go back to what our story pullers are,

163
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:46,892
or our golden path, and say, hey, if we remove this,

164
00:08:47,372 --> 00:08:49,053
is this going to create a disconnect in our game?

165
00:08:49,073 --> 00:08:54,815
All right, so we've identified our core themes.

166
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:55,975
Where do we go from here?

167
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,656
Enter what I like to call the three, two, one approach.

168
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:05,304
This is ideally three tiers of investment, at least two methods of choosing what budget

169
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:10,930
or investment a mission or narrative device should be, and ideally one, only one, goal

170
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,935
or north star that keeps decisions in context when it's time to make tough calls.

171
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:18,785
So let's start off with our tiers of investment.

172
00:09:19,145 --> 00:09:21,807
These can be delineated in any clear category you want,

173
00:09:22,287 --> 00:09:23,528
either that's high, medium, or low,

174
00:09:23,588 --> 00:09:25,749
or my personal favorite, gold, silver, bronze.

175
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,530
It includes a level of investment

176
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,372
that can be expected within each tier,

177
00:09:29,972 --> 00:09:31,173
and of course, you guessed it,

178
00:09:31,193 --> 00:09:32,614
they're contextualized by how they fit

179
00:09:32,634 --> 00:09:35,275
into the story-critical path and our core narrative beats.

180
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,883
So let's start by defining each one, beginning with the gold tier.

181
00:09:40,903 --> 00:09:43,766
So now your gold is going to be the best of the best.

182
00:09:43,986 --> 00:09:45,848
It's where you want to spend the most time and effort,

183
00:09:46,068 --> 00:09:49,672
but it's also in places where players are most likely to encounter or experience it.

184
00:09:50,232 --> 00:09:52,915
It's high cost, sure, but it's also high value,

185
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:55,277
because not only is it on a story critical path,

186
00:09:55,577 --> 00:09:58,140
but it's also representing a core narrative beat for your game.

187
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:02,460
So a good smell test for evaluating whether a mission in your game should be considered

188
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,246
a part of the core narrative beats and the story critical path is by assessing its cut

189
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:06,667
impact.

190
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,893
If not having this mission in your game would remove a significant story pillar, then it's

191
00:10:10,954 --> 00:10:12,336
likely critical to the story.

192
00:10:14,501 --> 00:10:18,205
So for missions in your campaign, what qualifies as gold is simple, it's the intersection between

193
00:10:18,245 --> 00:10:19,166
our two main themes.

194
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:23,531
But for other narrative devices at your disposal, it's important for you to decide as a team

195
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:24,712
what gold looks like.

196
00:10:25,352 --> 00:10:29,677
So I've added some other examples of what a hypothetical gold tier could be for reference.

197
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:32,609
Gonna begin by saying high-end cinematics.

198
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:35,172
My personal philosophy is that high-end cinematics

199
00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:37,274
are always exclusively used for the gold tier

200
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:39,876
because typically, cinematics are the most expensive.

201
00:10:39,896 --> 00:10:41,818
They're gonna use your highest character quality,

202
00:10:41,938 --> 00:10:43,600
highest polish of animation,

203
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,082
highest fidelity props and textures,

204
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:48,085
and a lot of resources for multidisciplinary teams.

205
00:10:48,757 --> 00:10:52,721
But maybe you're not employing cinematics and you have some other high-end narrative devices.

206
00:10:53,141 --> 00:10:58,046
This could be some maybe highly polished authored and narrative sequences or animation sequences.

207
00:10:58,146 --> 00:10:59,487
Maybe it's a highly polished camera.

208
00:11:00,007 --> 00:11:02,189
Essentially, this is what's going to be the most expensive,

209
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:05,512
but it's also what's going to look the best and you as a team get to decide what that is.

210
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:09,536
As I said, I like visuals. So let's map this out.

211
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:13,584
So again, we have our story critical path here in pale blue,

212
00:11:13,684 --> 00:11:15,485
and we have our core narrative beats in purple,

213
00:11:15,886 --> 00:11:17,486
just as with our Lion King example.

214
00:11:18,147 --> 00:11:20,328
And so when we talk about what belongs in the gold tier,

215
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:22,249
what's high value, what's high visibility,

216
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:24,090
but what's also integral to our story,

217
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,171
and of course, that means it's going to receive

218
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:28,452
the highest priority, we're talking about a mission

219
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:30,914
or a narrative device within our story

220
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:32,234
that intersects both paths.

221
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:33,975
And that's gonna look something like this.

222
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,434
It's key to note here that the core narrative beats that are the most memorable also exist

223
00:11:40,494 --> 00:11:40,834
in the end.

224
00:11:41,115 --> 00:11:44,017
So when we're planning out how we're going to spend our narrative dollars, we also have

225
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:48,301
to plan for investing in those goal tier assets throughout the narrative of our story, and

226
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,183
not just in the beginning, and not just in the end.

227
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:54,707
This is so we can use them for all the moments that truly deserve them, no matter where it

228
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:55,948
is in our narrative.

229
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:00,111
So for mapping out the next tier, we're going to move on to silver.

230
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:05,862
So medium to high visibility experiences, our silver tier reflects assets that are polished

231
00:12:05,982 --> 00:12:08,544
but don't have the same level of cost as gold assets.

232
00:12:09,224 --> 00:12:10,605
So what's medium to high visibility?

233
00:12:11,266 --> 00:12:15,229
For missions, these would be things that are on the story critical path but are off our

234
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:16,050
core narrative beats.

235
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:21,457
Another way to determine if this fits into the silver tier is to assess its cut impact.

236
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:25,861
So if a mission or other narrative device in your story can be considered silver tier,

237
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:28,844
if removing it would not remove a story pillar from your game,

238
00:12:28,944 --> 00:12:33,748
but would tangibly lower the overall narrative experience, i.e. the story would still make sense,

239
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:36,871
but a player could tell that something is missing, or worse,

240
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:39,814
it looks like something was cut in post and that's not where you want to be.

241
00:12:42,782 --> 00:12:46,624
So other examples of the level of investment you can be assigning to devices that are considered

242
00:12:46,704 --> 00:12:50,526
silver tier are what I like to call reusing gold assets.

243
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:55,349
So if you have a gold asset that can be curated in some small way with minimal lift and minimal

244
00:12:55,369 --> 00:12:59,491
investment, that is a prime target for something that can be in the silver tier category.

245
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:00,031
Why?

246
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:03,573
Because you know it's already going to be polished and it's not going to take too much

247
00:13:03,653 --> 00:13:04,974
of your overall narrative dollars.

248
00:13:06,072 --> 00:13:08,393
Hopefully you already have some newer polished cameras

249
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,954
that are lower cost than some of your gold tier of devices

250
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:11,534
that you're using.

251
00:13:11,894 --> 00:13:13,915
And so if that's the case, you want to use them here as well.

252
00:13:14,655 --> 00:13:17,356
I would say in this tier that new cinematics are discouraged.

253
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,537
And that's because, yes, cinematics

254
00:13:19,697 --> 00:13:21,938
are typically super, super cost intensive.

255
00:13:22,298 --> 00:13:23,698
So if you're going to put them in the silver tier,

256
00:13:23,738 --> 00:13:24,439
they should be rare.

257
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:26,599
And if needed, they should be small in scope.

258
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,720
That means your tech, your character count,

259
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:32,282
and your complexity should be kept to a bare minimum.

260
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,236
Right, we're back to our visual example.

261
00:13:36,476 --> 00:13:37,877
Again, we have our story critical path

262
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:38,958
and our core narrative beats.

263
00:13:39,398 --> 00:13:41,680
The gold we know is reserved for those narrative devices

264
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,580
that intersect both,

265
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:44,702
because they're going to take a lot more time and effort,

266
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:46,603
and thus can't be everywhere in your game.

267
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:50,006
So if a narrative device or moment or mission

268
00:13:50,346 --> 00:13:51,827
is not defined as a core narrative beat,

269
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:53,208
but it's still integral to the story,

270
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:55,070
it belongs on your story critical path,

271
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,791
and that's where you want your silver,

272
00:13:56,811 --> 00:13:58,872
to your narrative devices to be.

273
00:13:59,753 --> 00:14:01,594
And of course, here we have in our example,

274
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:02,415
Simba just.

275
00:14:04,664 --> 00:14:11,102
but also we see that there's that passage of time that's integral to connect the two key moments of the end of the line king together.

276
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,310
And of course, that leaves us with our last tier.

277
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,711
The bronze tier is defined by low visibility missions or other narrative devices,

278
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,791
where reuse is the name of the game.

279
00:14:20,952 --> 00:14:24,512
It is highly encouraged, and ideally a lower investment is all that's required.

280
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:27,913
Something in the bronze tier is both off your core narrative beat

281
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:31,514
and off your story critical path, and that means it is lower visibility.

282
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:35,435
And of course, to think about it another way, we can calculate the cut impact.

283
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:39,559
So if cutting it would have minimal effects on your overall core narrative beats,

284
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,343
or it wouldn't remove a narrative link from the game,

285
00:14:42,903 --> 00:14:46,488
then it probably is either considered a bronze tier or a nice-to-have.

286
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:48,010
If you're thinking to yourself,

287
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,934
hey, if we removed this part of the game, if we removed this narrative moment,

288
00:14:51,214 --> 00:14:55,239
and players could not tell that we removed it, it's likely belonging in the bronze tier.

289
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,067
All right, bronze tier devices.

290
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:01,869
I'm just going to say it right up front, right again, no cinematics.

291
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:06,010
They're just too costly for something that players may or may not experience

292
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,071
throughout the course of your game.

293
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:09,552
Again, reuse is the name of the game here.

294
00:15:09,572 --> 00:15:12,673
So you want to be reusing already existing narrative systems or sequences.

295
00:15:12,974 --> 00:15:14,894
Or if you have a dynamic system or narrative system,

296
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:15,975
you want to be using it here too.

297
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:22,059
And then if you're going to be employing other narrative devices, maybe you have animation sequences or authored cameras,

298
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:28,584
minimally altered at best, because again, we want to be saving our narrative dollars for our silver or gold tier devices.

299
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:36,919
Alright, so you've heard me say cost and refer to cost a few times, but I want to get into an example of how I tangibly calculate it.

300
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:43,846
So in this Venn diagram, it helps to showcase how the cost of your mission or narrative device can determine the level of investment you can expect,

301
00:15:44,207 --> 00:15:48,011
and thus where you'll get the most value utilizing them over the narrative in your game.

302
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:54,297
We can consider the outer edges of each circle low cost and therefore require less of an investment.

303
00:15:56,543 --> 00:16:04,307
And so as we move further and start combining different attributes, for example, building an asset or a narrative device that takes more resources and more complexity,

304
00:16:04,648 --> 00:16:07,369
we start to increase our cost and thus our overall investment.

305
00:16:07,909 --> 00:16:14,913
And because we're increasing our overall investment, we want to be saving that high-cost device for where the players are most likely to experience it,

306
00:16:15,313 --> 00:16:20,256
which brings us back to the moments that intersect our core narrative beats and our golden path.

307
00:16:20,796 --> 00:16:25,558
And you can see in this example here, if something, say, is high complexity and high time, or

308
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:29,460
and costs high time, it's going to be mainly a silver tier asset.

309
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,162
If it costs all three, it's going to be considered gold.

310
00:16:32,622 --> 00:16:33,843
And what do we want to do with gold?

311
00:16:34,003 --> 00:16:37,805
We want to be reserving them for the moments that matter, the ones that intersect our core

312
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:39,766
narrative beads and our golden path.

313
00:16:42,008 --> 00:16:46,191
So this is what our investment would look like if we were to plot it out in a perfect world.

314
00:16:46,751 --> 00:16:49,974
But this is game development, and it's nothing short of what I like to call

315
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:54,197
very perfect surprises along the course of production.

316
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:59,660
And so these models aren't meant to show you what has to be true or what is truly black and white.

317
00:17:00,281 --> 00:17:02,803
In truth, your investment might not look like this.

318
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:07,686
Your investment might look a little bit something like this, which is absolutely okay.

319
00:17:08,687 --> 00:17:11,928
These visuals are meant as a guide in order to help your team's decision making.

320
00:17:12,229 --> 00:17:14,770
So that when you're adding a silver tier narrative device that's, say,

321
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,791
off the story critical path, but you're doing it with intention,

322
00:17:18,151 --> 00:17:21,632
it's okay because you have made that intentional choice and have had those conversations

323
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:24,733
of whether or not it deserves that level of investment.

324
00:17:27,534 --> 00:17:29,835
All right, so we got our three tiers. Now what?

325
00:17:31,376 --> 00:17:35,057
Now you want to develop at least two methods of choosing what level of investment a mission

326
00:17:35,157 --> 00:17:36,438
or narrative device should be.

327
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:42,897
This works because it's going to simplify decisions by bringing it back to your defined tiers.

328
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:45,218
This is why having three tiers is so important.

329
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:49,921
You want to be able to group things into either high, medium, or low, gold, silver, or bronze,

330
00:17:50,061 --> 00:17:52,083
and then assign a cost value to each.

331
00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:55,765
When you do this, it ensures consistency and accountability

332
00:17:56,105 --> 00:17:59,508
across a wide variety of narrative devices and missions on your project

333
00:17:59,548 --> 00:18:02,150
because you're always bringing it back to your core tier investments.

334
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,792
And of course, it empowers your devs to work together more autonomously

335
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:08,674
because you're providing a common reference for shared resources.

336
00:18:10,987 --> 00:18:14,629
So once you know the key narrative devices your game will employ,

337
00:18:14,709 --> 00:18:17,291
whether it's cinematics, whether it's another narrative device,

338
00:18:17,711 --> 00:18:19,613
you want to represent them on a hierarchy.

339
00:18:20,093 --> 00:18:23,315
So I'm going to show a sort of a quad table of what that looks like.

340
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:25,917
I'm going to go over each of the columns and rows

341
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:29,280
so we can get a better idea of what we saw in our visual example

342
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,663
represented in another way as a method of decision making for our devs.

343
00:18:36,684 --> 00:18:39,126
All right, so here we have one of our methods of decision-making.

344
00:18:39,446 --> 00:18:42,748
In our first column, you see that I've put on top cinematics,

345
00:18:43,408 --> 00:18:46,230
or whatever your high-cost narrative device is going to be.

346
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:48,212
This, you want it to be your highest.

347
00:18:49,052 --> 00:18:51,694
On the right, on the left edge, you see something that says

348
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:54,716
it is on the core narrative beats and the story-critical path.

349
00:18:55,376 --> 00:18:57,998
The middle row says that it is off a core narrative beat,

350
00:18:58,258 --> 00:18:59,899
but it is on a story-critical path.

351
00:19:00,379 --> 00:19:04,342
And the bottom row says it is off both the story-critical path

352
00:19:04,682 --> 00:19:05,563
and the core narrative beat.

353
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:09,951
And so we go down the line and say, all right, if we're choosing,

354
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:11,992
say we want to put a cinematic here.

355
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:15,295
We develop, we ask ourselves where it belongs in the story.

356
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:17,976
If it's both intersecting both our core narrative beats

357
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:19,737
and our story critical path, it's gold.

358
00:19:20,418 --> 00:19:23,540
If it only intersects the story critical path, it's silver.

359
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,002
Or it's a, hey, should I really be spending all my dollars

360
00:19:26,162 --> 00:19:29,424
on a experience that is not gold or not a story pillar?

361
00:19:29,884 --> 00:19:32,726
And if it is intersecting neither, then maybe we

362
00:19:32,746 --> 00:19:35,548
don't want to spend our highest value narrative device

363
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:36,568
in this particular.

364
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:41,890
And then moving along to the second column, we have the second narrative device you can employ.

365
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:46,631
So this needs to be, overall, typically, less costly than your first narrative device,

366
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:49,332
because that's going to be the highest. And then we move on to the next column,

367
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:52,353
that is going to be your least costly narrative device.

368
00:19:52,773 --> 00:19:57,314
And so we're giving our developers options. We're saying, hey, maybe we can't use a cinematic here,

369
00:19:57,354 --> 00:20:01,075
but what I can get you is a lower cost gold narrative 3 moment,

370
00:20:01,395 --> 00:20:03,076
depending on the cost that you're assigning to each.

371
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:07,017
Hopefully you're still with me.

372
00:20:07,477 --> 00:20:09,198
The same can be said for missions.

373
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,138
So this is another method for decision making

374
00:20:11,158 --> 00:20:12,159
that I've used in the past.

375
00:20:12,459 --> 00:20:14,019
This one focuses predominantly around

376
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,260
how much of a level of investment you should spend

377
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,981
based on where the missions appear within your game

378
00:20:19,161 --> 00:20:20,222
and the level of visibility.

379
00:20:20,782 --> 00:20:23,523
So from the top it says, what type of mission is this?

380
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,063
We're going to go all the way to the right.

381
00:20:25,323 --> 00:20:27,624
If it is a side mission, I'm going to implore you

382
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,085
to just go right down to bronze.

383
00:20:29,345 --> 00:20:31,106
Just save your storytelling dollars

384
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:32,166
for the moments that matter.

385
00:20:32,686 --> 00:20:34,387
But maybe it is a main mission,

386
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:35,547
or you simply don't know yet.

387
00:20:35,888 --> 00:20:37,928
That's okay, the decision matrix will help you find

388
00:20:38,108 --> 00:20:38,849
where you need to be.

389
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:41,030
So, is it integral to the story?

390
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:42,070
Is it a core narrative beat?

391
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,970
Yes, it is.

392
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,872
Do you know if it is part of the main storyline?

393
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,852
Is it a part of one true story pillar?

394
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,893
If it's not, maybe you should be using

395
00:20:49,953 --> 00:20:50,814
a silver tier device.

396
00:20:51,214 --> 00:20:51,554
If it is,

397
00:20:52,034 --> 00:20:54,055
Move forward and have faith in using your gold.

398
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,779
Alright, we have all that in place.

399
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:00,980
We talked about our themes.

400
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,881
We have our methods for decision making.

401
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:05,083
But what if there is still contention?

402
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:07,444
What if there is a more complex call to make

403
00:21:07,824 --> 00:21:09,886
and your stakeholders simply cannot agree?

404
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,370
Well, first, I'm hoping that you've come to my talk.

405
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,651
That's a shameless plug there.

406
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:17,371
But I'm also hoping that you've aligned with your teams

407
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:20,092
on the core narrative beats early on in pre-production.

408
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:22,393
But, withstanding all of that,

409
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,513
there's still one more tool in our tool belt

410
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:25,213
for our approach.

411
00:21:26,654 --> 00:21:28,114
That's going to be the one goal,

412
00:21:28,594 --> 00:21:29,895
aka the North Star.

413
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:34,400
It asks us what pillars are truly unshakable.

414
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:38,106
It asks what must be true if all else fails.

415
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:42,474
And three, and most importantly, what is your narrative's purpose?

416
00:21:44,807 --> 00:21:48,149
This could be a collection of the core narrative beats, but it works even better if we can

417
00:21:48,189 --> 00:21:52,112
pick just one, because this helps us focus our decision making and spend our narrative

418
00:21:52,132 --> 00:21:55,915
dollars in a way that services this one truth, the one North Star.

419
00:21:56,715 --> 00:22:00,438
And when all other decisions become more complex as we go throughout the course of production,

420
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:06,563
it reminds us of what is truly important to us, what, no matter of what else, needs to

421
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:06,903
be true.

422
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,344
That's where you want to spend the most, but that's also where we're likely to get the most bang for our buck.

423
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:17,207
And if everything else in our game can be near, adjacent to, or on the periphery of our one North Star,

424
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:18,968
then we know we've done something right.

425
00:22:20,168 --> 00:22:23,930
So let's go back to the beginning, where we have our core narrative beats for our Lion King example.

426
00:22:24,661 --> 00:22:28,286
It could be that your one north star is that the audience needed to see the change from

427
00:22:28,366 --> 00:22:33,534
utopia to dystopia to back again, or it could be that Scar must be defeated, it could be

428
00:22:33,594 --> 00:22:37,660
that Simba needed to meet others that helped him on his journey to adopt a new mindset,

429
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:40,965
or it could be that Simba must grow into king at the end.

430
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:47,915
I would argue, and let's say for our example, that our one North Star is that Simba must

431
00:22:47,995 --> 00:22:49,155
grow into king at the end.

432
00:22:49,816 --> 00:22:53,477
In the beginning, he was going to be king, but let's be honest, he was pretty naive about

433
00:22:53,517 --> 00:22:53,557
it.

434
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:54,877
Did he really deserve it?

435
00:22:55,158 --> 00:22:55,758
It's questionable.

436
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:57,358
I don't want to badmouth Simba.

437
00:22:57,598 --> 00:22:57,998
Great guy.

438
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:02,460
But as we go through the story, as we go through the movie, we see that he learns what it means

439
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,500
to truly be king.

440
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,681
He learns what it means to make the tough calls.

441
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:11,783
He learns what it means to understand and accept his past and reconfront his biggest

442
00:23:11,863 --> 00:23:12,023
fear.

443
00:23:13,035 --> 00:23:17,140
And now everything else in that film just needs to fall in around that one North Star.

444
00:23:19,682 --> 00:23:23,566
So when we go back to our first tricky question, how do we tell great stories on a budget?

445
00:23:24,026 --> 00:23:28,211
I hope I've given you some tools and frameworks to start developing that structure for your own projects,

446
00:23:28,691 --> 00:23:30,713
but I also hope that you've learned one more thing.

447
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,502
When everything feels important, but time is limited, we can ask ourselves,

448
00:23:36,063 --> 00:23:40,966
what is the one goal or North Star that must be true and that we can come back to when decisions get tough?

449
00:23:41,707 --> 00:23:45,930
What are at least two methods of choosing what investment, a mission, or narrative device should be?

450
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:51,674
And what are at least three tiers of investment that define the level of focus that should be devoted to the elements of our story,

451
00:23:52,074 --> 00:23:55,556
based on where they can be found within the story-critical paths and core narrative beats?

452
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:01,582
So, but the real question isn't how do we tell great stories on a budget, but how do

453
00:24:01,622 --> 00:24:06,384
we stay true to the purpose of our story and how can we invest to truly service it from

454
00:24:06,424 --> 00:24:07,705
beginning, middle to end?

455
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:12,348
And I hope I've given you some answers to help totally answer that tricky question here

456
00:24:12,388 --> 00:24:12,628
today.

457
00:24:13,708 --> 00:24:14,449
Thank you so much.

458
00:24:14,709 --> 00:24:15,669
My name is Blas Nairko.

459
00:24:15,689 --> 00:24:16,790
You can find me on email, LinkedIn, or Twitter.

460
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,791
Thank you for coming to my talk.

461
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:18,011
Thank you.

462
00:24:18,071 --> 00:24:18,251
Thank you.

463
00:24:18,451 --> 00:24:18,771
Thank you.

464
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:18,971
Thank you.

465
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:19,171
Thank you.

466
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:19,411
Thank you.

467
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:19,612
Thank you.

468
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:33,231
I believe we have some time for Q&A, questions and answers.

469
00:24:34,511 --> 00:24:40,994
This time I'm also going to do what it says on this card here and remind everyone to fill

470
00:24:41,014 --> 00:24:42,014
out their evaluations.

471
00:24:42,194 --> 00:24:46,456
Of course, filling out the evaluations for GDC and feedback is super important, not only

472
00:24:46,496 --> 00:24:52,378
because it tells us how we did, but it helps GDC promote new content that could be encouraged

473
00:24:52,418 --> 00:24:54,338
for next year and all talks to come.

474
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:59,620
So I greatly appreciate your feedback and also taking the time to sit with me here today.

475
00:25:07,028 --> 00:25:07,889
Yeah, absolutely.

476
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,731
So the question was if I could go back to the grid matrix.

477
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:14,372
I'm just going to flip through the slide here.

478
00:25:24,796 --> 00:25:30,139
It is a very quiet room and so I hope that means everybody has learned of core narrative

479
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:31,420
beats and the story critical path.

480
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:41,548
Hi, Vanessa. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what escalation paths at the coalition look like if you really are stuck on budget decisions.

481
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:46,429
Like, is it pretty much just, like, up through management levels or are there multiple departments that get involved?

482
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:52,011
I'm curious, because I deal with this a little bit at my company and it can get kind of messy, so I'm just kind of curious what it looks like for you.

483
00:25:53,061 --> 00:25:57,465
Yeah, so the question was about the escalation paths that exist when we're up against making

484
00:25:57,485 --> 00:25:59,146
those tough calls, if I understand that right.

485
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:02,730
Yeah, when we're up against making those tough calls, what does that escalation path look

486
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:02,930
like?

487
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:07,554
And so for me, it always starts with trusting my developers and the teams that I work with.

488
00:26:07,654 --> 00:26:10,476
I truly believe that our teams are our experts.

489
00:26:10,697 --> 00:26:14,860
And so for me, it starts firstly at somebody raising the flag that, hey, this is going

490
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,784
to take more time than I thought, or this is more complex than we are giving it, we're

491
00:26:18,804 --> 00:26:20,305
giving it the correct amount of thought to.

492
00:26:20,986 --> 00:26:24,928
Sometimes we get an overall direction and an overall vision that looks great on paper,

493
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:27,329
sometimes it looks a little bit too good on paper,

494
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:31,872
and then it's up to us and our teams to really dissect how much it's going to cost.

495
00:26:32,372 --> 00:26:34,753
And once we figure out whether or not maybe it just doesn't fit,

496
00:26:35,154 --> 00:26:37,375
what I usually do is work with my teams to understand,

497
00:26:37,635 --> 00:26:40,096
okay, what is our good, better, and best scenario?

498
00:26:40,497 --> 00:26:45,138
So the good scenario is that, hey, maybe we can do 70% of this or 50% of this.

499
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:46,258
What does that look like?

500
00:26:46,458 --> 00:26:47,838
Tangibly, what does it represent?

501
00:26:48,259 --> 00:26:52,039
And I always ask and implore others to not showcase what we want to be true,

502
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,540
but showcase how it is.

503
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,401
If the risk is a risk, the best thing we can do is float it up to the top.

504
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:59,181
And so what I would do is I'd speak with my leads,

505
00:26:59,481 --> 00:27:01,942
I'd speak with my directors, I'd speak with my production director,

506
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:04,943
and make sure everybody has a visibility on the risk

507
00:27:04,983 --> 00:27:06,343
and that we're over-communicating on it.

508
00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:09,764
I usually try to get the teams together within a breakout session to say,

509
00:27:10,304 --> 00:27:12,048
Hey, this is what we are up against.

510
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:14,533
These are the possible solutions our team has come up with.

511
00:27:14,894 --> 00:27:16,617
What do you think would be the best course of action?

512
00:27:16,978 --> 00:27:20,145
And we move forward when everybody's in agreement on what solution that should be.

513
00:27:23,093 --> 00:27:31,399
Hi. I was wondering, the tiers of investment of gold, silver, and bronze, that seems really

514
00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:36,984
helpful as breaking it down broadly, but I was wondering if in the projects you've worked

515
00:27:37,084 --> 00:27:44,870
on if any of the storytelling beats have demanded more granularity. Like, okay, between all

516
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:48,052
of our golden moments, this one is the most important.

517
00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:53,451
Does it help to categorize that into, say, a platinum tier?

518
00:27:53,471 --> 00:28:02,496
Or how do you pursue greater granularity when you're stuck in a room with two gold beats

519
00:28:02,676 --> 00:28:04,897
and one of them needs to be higher than the other?

520
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:13,195
Yeah, so the question was, how do we prioritize even within the gold tiers or even within the silver tier or bronze tiers?

521
00:28:14,055 --> 00:28:18,198
And you know, we're not wanting to strong arm anyone, but usually something that I like to employ is,

522
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:24,702
if we're deciding between two gold moments, I ask, if we had to lose one of these today, which one would it be?

523
00:28:25,562 --> 00:28:29,064
And if the answer is we can't lose either of them, we go into the whys.

524
00:28:29,305 --> 00:28:34,288
And I think it's always important to set aside, okay, what is the why for goal scenario A?

525
00:28:34,408 --> 00:28:36,029
What is the why for goal scenario B?

526
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:41,192
And usually when you ask people the why and like, okay, so that's important to our story, why is it important?

527
00:28:41,612 --> 00:28:44,714
As you go through the whys and you keep going to different levels of granularity,

528
00:28:45,114 --> 00:28:47,455
you can find out what is the most important moment.

529
00:28:47,816 --> 00:28:52,318
Sometimes they're saying, oh, well, I need it to be true because this has to happen within the game.

530
00:28:52,638 --> 00:28:55,821
But then we're actually opening a dialogue of whether or not it truly needs to happen

531
00:28:55,841 --> 00:28:56,382
within the game.

532
00:28:56,962 --> 00:29:00,565
And, of course, if you're bringing in the historical data of, you know, we simply don't

533
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:05,169
have time for both of them, or one of them is going to have to get less of a treatment,

534
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:09,312
then it comes to our decision makers on, okay, now that we've identified the why in our,

535
00:29:09,532 --> 00:29:09,712
you know,

536
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:12,875
Just a quick table of why this is important,

537
00:29:12,955 --> 00:29:13,756
why this is important.

538
00:29:14,076 --> 00:29:16,137
We get a sense of, based on how long the list is,

539
00:29:16,258 --> 00:29:17,659
what is truly the platinum moment.

540
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:19,620
I've also worked on projects where we have

541
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,062
what we call a wood, which is less than bronze.

542
00:29:22,723 --> 00:29:25,885
But usually I like to stay within the three tiers

543
00:29:25,925 --> 00:29:27,907
because I'm just like, you know, how granular can we get?

544
00:29:28,527 --> 00:29:31,829
I also want to say that it's worth noting as well is that within your narrative devices,

545
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:36,012
gold might look different for each one. So if you're working on a cinematic,

546
00:29:36,052 --> 00:29:40,154
you can say that a gold cinematic is maybe, you know, your very highly polished characters,

547
00:29:40,215 --> 00:29:44,057
but potentially if you're working on a mission giver system that happens within

548
00:29:44,597 --> 00:29:48,900
the actual inside of your world and inside of your gameplay, maybe gold for you makes it look like,

549
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:52,462
hey, we need to make sure we have a good vista shot. So within each narrative tier,

550
00:29:52,482 --> 00:29:54,263
you need to be defining what gold looks like.

551
00:29:54,623 --> 00:29:57,146
You can be using the same terminology between each,

552
00:29:57,186 --> 00:29:59,027
so you're aligning on your shared resources,

553
00:29:59,428 --> 00:30:01,409
but you should have that level of granularity that says,

554
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:04,132
okay, silver means this for this narrative device,

555
00:30:04,532 --> 00:30:06,213
and silver means something different

556
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:07,194
for that narrative device.

557
00:30:07,314 --> 00:30:09,256
But as long as it's in a place where everybody can access it

558
00:30:09,336 --> 00:30:10,597
and they understand the difference,

559
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:11,838
then I think you're in a good spot.

560
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:13,540
Awesome.

561
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:14,420
Hi.

562
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,341
Thank you, Vanessa.

563
00:30:15,461 --> 00:30:17,043
Really outstanding presentation.

564
00:30:17,103 --> 00:30:18,924
I appreciated how methodical

565
00:30:19,124 --> 00:30:20,766
and just well-thought-out your approach is.

566
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:21,527
It makes a lot of sense.

567
00:30:22,075 --> 00:30:25,418
My question relates to if you've experienced where someone's method of decision making

568
00:30:25,478 --> 00:30:30,403
was, I outrank you, or it's a business call, or I'm the senior developer, or even if your

569
00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:35,888
narrative team has consensus, someone else who's in a senior position can just say, well,

570
00:30:36,328 --> 00:30:37,269
what I say goes.

571
00:30:37,749 --> 00:30:42,634
So despite this really thoughtful work, when you have these other internal management factors,

572
00:30:43,034 --> 00:30:46,618
how have you navigated that in the past, or how would you recommend navigating those dynamics?

573
00:30:47,138 --> 00:31:08,612
Yeah, that's a really good question. So the question for anyone who may have missed it is, how do we navigate if someone would said, Hey, yeah, I'm glad you came up with all of these great methods, but we're just going to go one way, a way that doesn't represent what we've talked about here before. And for that, I just want to go back if I can go back a little bit. Keep going.

574
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:10,820
There we go.

575
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,922
So when I talk about generating a high level of discussion

576
00:31:14,242 --> 00:31:16,183
and holding us accountable on those decisions,

577
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:18,104
I personally have not experienced

578
00:31:18,204 --> 00:31:19,125
what we're talking about here,

579
00:31:19,305 --> 00:31:21,226
but what I like to do is when I talk about

580
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:23,467
holding people accountable, it's the stakeholders.

581
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:25,989
That's the first level of people that you wanna make sure

582
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:28,050
are in line with your core narrative beats

583
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:29,211
and your story critical path.

584
00:31:29,691 --> 00:31:31,892
And that's because if they are in line with it,

585
00:31:32,153 --> 00:31:33,253
we can hold them accountable.

586
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:37,935
My favorite thing to do that I, well, I love standing out notes, but I also love the fact

587
00:31:37,975 --> 00:31:39,915
that working from home allows us to record all meetings.

588
00:31:40,555 --> 00:31:44,617
So we can always remember what we said we were going to do and what we agreed upon.

589
00:31:45,117 --> 00:31:48,918
And so when we're, I also make sure that we're constantly refreshing them with this knowledge.

590
00:31:49,238 --> 00:31:53,599
It's like, hey, we're moving into mission A. Remember, we discussed that gold looks

591
00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:54,019
like this.

592
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:58,660
And because it's usually your stakeholders, maybe four or five, we locked eyes, we agreed

593
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,201
upon the fact that this is what we're doing.

594
00:32:00,721 --> 00:32:02,522
Or we disseminate that information to the team.

595
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:07,124
We agree upon it at a higher level so that when we're going through the different tiers,

596
00:32:07,504 --> 00:32:11,426
it's not something that's just production's decision, it's production and direction's decision.

597
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:14,267
It's production directions and the dev decisions. It's everyone's decision.

598
00:32:14,587 --> 00:32:17,829
So everyone needs to be bought in in order for these methodological processes to work.

599
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:19,110
Thank you.

600
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,090
Yeah, my pleasure.

601
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:25,813
All right, we are at the end of the talk.

602
00:32:26,193 --> 00:32:27,874
If you have other questions, I will be...

603
00:32:31,035 --> 00:32:31,996
Oh yeah, absolutely.

604
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,271
You know, I should have ended on that one.

605
00:32:34,311 --> 00:32:34,931
That's, yeah.

606
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:37,511
Oh, my pleasure.

607
00:32:39,072 --> 00:32:39,332
Okay.

608
00:32:39,452 --> 00:32:39,612
What?

609
00:32:39,672 --> 00:32:39,832
What?

610
00:32:40,852 --> 00:32:41,272
Ah, we did it.

611
00:32:41,613 --> 00:32:41,893
Okay.

612
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:44,113
That is the end of the talk.

613
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:45,274
Thank you again so much.

614
00:32:45,334 --> 00:32:48,654
If anyone wants to ask any questions, I believe it's, is it 204?

615
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:50,475
Yeah, 204.

616
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:52,235
I'll be in there to take any other questions.

617
00:32:52,576 --> 00:32:54,416
Again, I really appreciate your time this morning.

618
00:32:54,676 --> 00:32:55,816
Please enjoy the rest of your GDC.

619
00:32:55,836 --> 00:32:56,517
Also, please provide any feedback.

620
00:32:56,537 --> 00:32:57,837
It's really welcome and appreciated.

621
00:32:57,857 --> 00:32:58,317
Thanks again, everybody.

622
00:32:58,337 --> 00:32:58,737
Thank you.

623
00:32:58,757 --> 00:32:58,937
Thank you.

624
00:32:59,037 --> 00:32:59,257
Thank you.

625
00:32:59,277 --> 00:32:59,457
Thank you.

626
00:32:59,477 --> 00:32:59,677
Thank you.

627
00:32:59,697 --> 00:33:00,017
Thank you.

628
00:33:00,058 --> 00:33:00,298
Thank you.

629
00:33:00,318 --> 00:33:00,518
Thank you.

630
00:33:00,538 --> 00:33:00,778
Thank you.

631
00:33:00,818 --> 00:33:01,138
Thank you.
