1
00:00:07,064 --> 00:00:07,445
All right.

2
00:00:09,507 --> 00:00:09,948
Hey, everyone.

3
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:12,311
Glad you made it to my talk.

4
00:00:12,671 --> 00:00:13,372
My name is Mo.

5
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:15,435
I'm the lead designer at Mimimi.

6
00:00:16,176 --> 00:00:18,078
I'm not 12 years old, as you might think.

7
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:20,601
I'm 31, actually, to get that out of the way quickly.

8
00:00:22,924 --> 00:00:27,667
I hope there is going to be two key takeaways you have from this post-mortem for Shadow

9
00:00:27,687 --> 00:00:28,107
Tactics.

10
00:00:28,267 --> 00:00:32,090
It's a design-focused post-mortem, so maybe you learned something about game design or

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,111
our approach or what not to do.

12
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:39,095
And you will definitely learn that I'm a horrible artist because I drew through the whole thing

13
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:39,995
because I like doodles.

14
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:42,537
But you'll have to sit through that now, I guess.

15
00:00:44,718 --> 00:00:49,322
All right, so let's jump straight ahead to the release day of Shadow Tactics.

16
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:57,490
This was the team on our release day, which coincidentally was the same day that the German developer awards were held and we were nominated

17
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:02,513
for many of them and we won many of them and we got very drunk and

18
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:08,075
It was like going up the stage getting an award coming down checking the steam sales being like yes

19
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:13,798
And going up again and getting very very drunk and everybody was very happy and supposed to be very very happy

20
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:16,780
But there was a big dark cloud hanging above us

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,601
Because we knew that

22
00:01:19,576 --> 00:01:24,980
likely the studio would not exist anymore in one month of time and that was because

23
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:31,485
during the development as there were multiple reasons for this the the time of development

24
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:37,850
for shadow tactics was scheduled to be 18 months and we realized that we would need more time like

25
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:42,754
three more months was what we needed and so sometime during development that became clear and

26
00:01:44,348 --> 00:01:45,729
We had to put our own money into that.

27
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,530
And those were the savings we had to sort of survive

28
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,930
until the next project would roll in after Shadow Tactics.

29
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,591
And we had multiple projects lined up for that,

30
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:55,951
and they one by one kept breaking away,

31
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:57,792
as things can happen.

32
00:01:57,892 --> 00:01:59,652
And so we stood there and we made the decision

33
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:02,053
as the whole team, saying, okay,

34
00:02:02,073 --> 00:02:03,913
do we put those three months into the game

35
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:06,854
and go out with a very nice game, maybe?

36
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:09,215
Or do we not do that and feel bad about it

37
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:10,415
for the rest of our lives, maybe?

38
00:02:11,175 --> 00:02:11,335
So.

39
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:15,137
We made the hard decision to say, okay, this might be the last game we're making,

40
00:02:15,157 --> 00:02:16,617
but we're going to make it the best game we can,

41
00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:18,838
and put all our money into it.

42
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,901
And so most people on that picture were basically terminated at that time.

43
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:27,142
We knew that we would not be able to work together if things went wrong,

44
00:02:27,722 --> 00:02:30,123
except for everybody who was involved in the console ports.

45
00:02:31,256 --> 00:02:32,197
they would have to stay.

46
00:02:32,657 --> 00:02:35,418
And hopefully would have made a new project in that time,

47
00:02:35,438 --> 00:02:37,359
but it was a very bad feeling, of course.

48
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,881
Luckily, our CEO worked his ass off during that time,

49
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:43,703
and he came through and made a very good deal,

50
00:02:43,723 --> 00:02:45,424
a follow-up deal, and of course,

51
00:02:45,484 --> 00:02:46,924
publishers always wait a little bit.

52
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:49,745
And they had released a new game to see how it's doing,

53
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:51,946
and Shadow Tactics did well, so we managed to get a deal.

54
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:57,768
And on 23rd of December, he wrote us the email

55
00:02:57,788 --> 00:02:59,549
when everybody was at home with their families

56
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:00,669
that things are fine.

57
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,330
We're going to be alive.

58
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:06,772
And this was in January, where we met in the center of Munich.

59
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:09,453
We're from Munich, Germany, and burned all the paperwork

60
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:11,313
and, again, got very, very drunk.

61
00:03:12,979 --> 00:03:16,362
So this is all I'm going to say about the business, whatever side.

62
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,743
The rest is going to be design.

63
00:03:18,923 --> 00:03:20,424
I hope that you know shadow tactics.

64
00:03:20,544 --> 00:03:23,627
If you don't, this might be a very, see, I'm not a very good artist.

65
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:28,230
Um, if you do not know shadow tactics, I'm going to quickly explain it, but this

66
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,431
talk might be a little boring for you.

67
00:03:29,931 --> 00:03:30,331
Um, so.

68
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:36,486
In Shadow Tactics it's a stealth game from a top-down, isometric, whatever perspective.

69
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:39,009
And you're playing as a gang of five characters.

70
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,931
It's playing in Edo, Japan.

71
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:44,796
And basically there are huge maps filled with hundreds of enemies

72
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:48,320
and you have to combine the skills of your characters to sort of get through there

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,941
and take out all the enemies.

74
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:52,945
Or ghost your way through, which is a lot harder.

75
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:58,289
The main mechanic we use for that is sort of a view vision cone thing,

76
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:03,213
where you have a bright area and a dark area, and in the bright area you always get detected,

77
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:06,956
and in the dark area you can crouch through it and feel stealthy like a ninja.

78
00:04:07,837 --> 00:04:11,780
And this is familiar for anyone, this of course is all ripped from Commandos,

79
00:04:12,721 --> 00:04:16,184
which is our big inspiration, the Commandos series and the Desperados series.

80
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,599
This is a quick disclaimer now.

81
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,440
I love those games, and if I'm gonna say anything bad

82
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,260
about the old games, it's purely analytical.

83
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,621
I'm not trying to make them look bad, okay?

84
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:28,582
So, except for some of them.

85
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:29,782
They were not that good.

86
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,143
So, this is Commandos 1.

87
00:04:32,883 --> 00:04:34,864
It's the add-on for Commandos 1.

88
00:04:34,964 --> 00:04:36,785
It's our favorite game of the whole genre,

89
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:40,366
and the genre died about 10 or 15 years ago,

90
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:42,186
and we sort of had to find out why

91
00:04:42,226 --> 00:04:43,747
before we made another entry in the genre,

92
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,868
because maybe people just didn't wanna play this anymore,

93
00:04:45,928 --> 00:04:46,808
right, we had to find out.

94
00:04:47,408 --> 00:04:47,568
So.

95
00:04:48,525 --> 00:04:51,329
We played the games and we dug into feedback and all that,

96
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:55,994
and it pretty quickly became clear that the height of the genre basically was

97
00:04:56,314 --> 00:04:59,258
after Commandos 1 was released, there was Commandos 2 and Desperados 1,

98
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:03,683
which are very good games, and this was sort of the best moment for real-time tactics.

99
00:05:05,224 --> 00:05:06,946
And then everything started to go downhill.

100
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:10,126
For each of the series, it was something different.

101
00:05:10,146 --> 00:05:11,908
For the Commando series, it was that they wanted

102
00:05:11,948 --> 00:05:15,471
to go more cinematic, and they always had

103
00:05:15,511 --> 00:05:16,692
an affinity for movies.

104
00:05:16,852 --> 00:05:18,874
The Commando 2 is full of movie missions.

105
00:05:18,955 --> 00:05:20,316
They're sort of like movies.

106
00:05:20,356 --> 00:05:22,098
And in Commando 3, they pushed that quite a lot.

107
00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:27,731
things like parachute troops coming in and things surprising you and everything being cinematic and scripted.

108
00:05:28,051 --> 00:05:30,872
But that's not really what you want in a tactical game, right?

109
00:05:30,912 --> 00:05:35,713
You want to be able to not be surprised, to sort of deduct everything that's going on,

110
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,734
know what's going on, especially in a genre like this.

111
00:05:37,814 --> 00:05:40,295
And they sort of lost that by going very cinematic.

112
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:46,456
And the Desperados series went into some weird things where you could go into first person and start shooting people,

113
00:05:47,137 --> 00:05:48,957
and that just went very horribly.

114
00:05:50,078 --> 00:05:50,678
And for

115
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,390
The nail in the coffin basically then was Commando Strike Force,

116
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,510
which was a shooter game.

117
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:56,791
I never played it.

118
00:05:56,811 --> 00:05:58,132
I actually don't know if it's bad or good.

119
00:05:58,612 --> 00:06:01,113
But people were very angry about the game

120
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,994
because it wasn't what they wanted to have anymore.

121
00:06:03,454 --> 00:06:05,075
And so we realized the genre didn't

122
00:06:05,135 --> 00:06:06,956
die because people don't want to play it anymore.

123
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:08,937
It was because there was nothing for them to play.

124
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:11,938
And that's when our idea of shadow tactics

125
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:12,939
became a lot more real.

126
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:14,820
And we knew what we had to make.

127
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,421
And we also knew that we had to make the game like Commando's

128
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,122
one, two, and Desperados one, and not the other games.

129
00:06:21,385 --> 00:06:23,827
So, let's get into shadow tactics.

130
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,089
These are the characters we have in the game.

131
00:06:26,129 --> 00:06:27,730
I'm gonna give you a quick rundown of them.

132
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,950
On the left you have Mugen,

133
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,312
he's sort of the big, brutish samurai guy

134
00:06:31,352 --> 00:06:33,053
who can take out multiple enemies at once.

135
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:35,395
Next to him is Aiko, she's a kunoichi.

136
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:37,896
She's a female ninja, she can disguise

137
00:06:38,677 --> 00:06:40,238
and then walk freely amongst guards,

138
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:41,179
which is very powerful.

139
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:43,360
And Aiko and Mugen sort of have a thing going.

140
00:06:44,461 --> 00:06:45,822
Then in the center we have Hayato,

141
00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:46,622
he's the generic.

142
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:49,113
archetype ninja dude with a shuriken.

143
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:52,855
And he's very versatile and agile.

144
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,916
Next to him is the fan favorite, I guess.

145
00:06:55,036 --> 00:06:58,777
Her name is Yuki, and she lost her parents in the war

146
00:06:59,077 --> 00:07:01,698
and grew up on the streets, and she's a little bit crazy,

147
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:03,759
but in a funny way, so that's why people like her, I guess.

148
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,379
And then we have Takuma, who's sort of,

149
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,600
from a mechanical standpoint, the oddball.

150
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,881
I'm gonna talk about that in a little bit.

151
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:12,442
And on his head, it's Kuma.

152
00:07:12,582 --> 00:07:15,023
That's the pet tanuki he has, it's his distraction.

153
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:19,619
So I think that characters are the area where we most succeeded in the game.

154
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:22,242
They are the most important part of the game, and

155
00:07:22,582 --> 00:07:24,084
the decisions we made really worked out.

156
00:07:24,324 --> 00:07:26,166
And so I'm gonna talk about those a little bit.

157
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:27,848
When we looked at the old games,

158
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:31,251
we identified two problems they had with their character design.

159
00:07:31,412 --> 00:07:32,513
The first one is this guy.

160
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:34,978
This is the driver from Commandos 1.

161
00:07:35,118 --> 00:07:37,820
And anyone who played Commandos 1

162
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,881
might know what I'm getting at.

163
00:07:40,202 --> 00:07:42,524
The driver was used for one thing only,

164
00:07:42,564 --> 00:07:43,645
and that's driving vehicles.

165
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:46,667
So, and you don't drive many vehicles in Commandos.

166
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:49,169
So what would happen is you would take your cool characters

167
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:50,870
like the Green Beret, clear the whole map,

168
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,231
feel awesome with the Green Beret,

169
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:54,453
everybody's dead, and then there's a car,

170
00:07:54,553 --> 00:07:55,854
and then you're like, ah, the driver.

171
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:57,796
And you pull the driver, the whole map up,

172
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,577
and it just gets in the car and drives off.

173
00:08:00,017 --> 00:08:01,779
And so he's like a key, right?

174
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:02,259
He's not.

175
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:06,089
mechanically interesting character and not someone you use very much. He's just a key.

176
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:11,150
So this sort of became a design term for us, like characters shouldn't be drivery or the driver.

177
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,931
He's the epitome of failure for us in character design in these games.

178
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,452
And the next one I'm going to teach you a German word today, one that is very German.

179
00:08:20,672 --> 00:08:24,993
There you go. It's Eier legende Wollmilchsau. It's a typical German thing.

180
00:08:26,654 --> 00:08:31,195
I'm going to translate that literally for you. It means egg laying wool milk pig.

181
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:35,044
This is my interpretation of an egg-laying woolmilk pig.

182
00:08:36,004 --> 00:08:37,784
It's an animal that does it all, right?

183
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:40,425
And in the Commando series, there's usually one character

184
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:42,625
in every game that does it all, the Green Beret.

185
00:08:42,926 --> 00:08:45,866
He can carry bodies, he can use his knife to kill guards,

186
00:08:45,906 --> 00:08:46,906
he has a great distraction.

187
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:48,767
And we thought, that's pretty cool.

188
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:51,347
We want all our characters to be Eierlegende Wollmilchsäue.

189
00:08:51,987 --> 00:08:53,608
So that's what we did, basically.

190
00:08:54,048 --> 00:08:56,588
We developed a system where every character

191
00:08:56,628 --> 00:08:58,469
would have a certain type of skill,

192
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:00,209
and it was important that each of them had one.

193
00:09:01,685 --> 00:09:03,526
The main first thing of course is the melee kill.

194
00:09:04,066 --> 00:09:07,607
Each character has one and you can already see that Takuma sort of is the oddball because

195
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:13,188
he has a grenade, which is not very stealthy as a melee kill, but whatever.

196
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,769
I'm going to talk about that in a bit.

197
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:20,270
And they are all basically the same but we changed the balancing so that for example

198
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,530
Yuki who's not very...

199
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,059
good at this sort of thing, has a very messy kill animation, it takes a very long time,

200
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,562
so you have to use her differently.

201
00:09:27,762 --> 00:09:29,546
But it's important that they all can do it, right?

202
00:09:29,766 --> 00:09:32,973
Maybe someone is better in a certain situation, but they all can do the melee kill.

203
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:35,450
The next skill is very important.

204
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,971
It's the special, as we call it.

205
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,492
And this is sort of the skill that

206
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,593
describes what the character is.

207
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:43,475
And if you talk about the character

208
00:09:43,495 --> 00:09:44,996
when I described them to you previously,

209
00:09:45,056 --> 00:09:46,056
this is what you talk, right?

210
00:09:46,236 --> 00:09:48,078
If you tell a friend, this is the type of skill

211
00:09:48,098 --> 00:09:48,758
you're gonna talk about.

212
00:09:49,058 --> 00:09:50,219
For Hayato, it's the shuriken.

213
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,220
For Yuki, her trap that she can lure people in.

214
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,701
Mugen, the sword wind attack,

215
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:55,382
where he just obliterates everyone around him.

216
00:09:55,882 --> 00:09:59,944
It's not limited to three, what people think you can kill all the guards on the map with it.

217
00:10:01,145 --> 00:10:05,547
Then we have Aiko, she has a distraction as that skill which is rather special, it's the disguise ability,

218
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,348
and the snipe ability of Tsukuma.

219
00:10:09,488 --> 00:10:13,790
And while people might think that this is the most important skill for a character, it's actually not.

220
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,951
It's the most important one for the vision of a character.

221
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,633
But for gameplay the most important skill is the distraction, by far.

222
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:23,754
Because the distraction is the skill that you use to interact with the system of the game, right?

223
00:10:23,955 --> 00:10:25,595
The kill is just a kill, it's very binary.

224
00:10:26,097 --> 00:10:29,460
But with a distraction, you can sort of break up the enemy setups

225
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,541
and draw guards away and sort of...

226
00:10:33,763 --> 00:10:34,964
I had to say a bad word there, sorry.

227
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:38,266
..can mess with the setups that we build.

228
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:41,849
And it was very important that the distractions felt different

229
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:44,031
because they really define how you play a character.

230
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:46,032
This is the most important skill a character has.

231
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,474
Just to give you a simple example,

232
00:10:48,534 --> 00:10:50,836
if I use Yuki's whistle to whistle a character away,

233
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:52,817
it doesn't really matter if I kill him with a shuriken,

234
00:10:52,857 --> 00:10:54,638
if I stab him, if there's a trap, if there's...

235
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,113
Mugen doing his sword thing, it doesn't matter, right?

236
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:59,034
The important part was that I could draw him out

237
00:10:59,074 --> 00:10:59,974
with the whistle.

238
00:11:00,715 --> 00:11:03,176
So, they are actually the most important skill in the game.

239
00:11:04,357 --> 00:11:05,217
Each character has a gun.

240
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:08,079
And I'm gonna quickly talk about the role of guns

241
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:08,699
in the game.

242
00:11:11,821 --> 00:11:14,042
Many games, and also the old ones,

243
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:15,923
the Desperados and Commandos, did something

244
00:11:15,963 --> 00:11:17,484
where they had infinite ammo,

245
00:11:17,524 --> 00:11:19,425
and you could basically start shooting at any time,

246
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:21,606
and just draw all the guards on the map to your,

247
00:11:21,786 --> 00:11:22,087
and just...

248
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,764
kill them. And we didn't like that and we also realized that we would never be able

249
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:31,567
to create good gun gameplay mechanics and good stealth mechanics at the same time. So

250
00:11:31,647 --> 00:11:36,709
what we decided was that we will just not do shooting and shootouts in a big way so

251
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:42,212
our guns are more like stealth guns. They have a very small range of audio or noise

252
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,034
so people don't hear them as much but you have a very limited amount of ammunition.

253
00:11:46,434 --> 00:11:49,716
And the role is basically that if you're stuck in some sort of setup and you don't know what

254
00:11:49,756 --> 00:11:50,356
to do and you just

255
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:52,598
You can't figure it out, you just use your guns,

256
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:54,020
shoot everyone in that one setup,

257
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:54,921
and then you can move along.

258
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,543
So it's basically a joker or a small cheat that you have.

259
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:00,877
And they all have a health pack, but whatever.

260
00:12:01,237 --> 00:12:05,099
So the important part about this was that we made a system

261
00:12:05,119 --> 00:12:07,601
where every character has each type of skill.

262
00:12:08,341 --> 00:12:11,243
And the one that is most driver-like, I guess,

263
00:12:11,343 --> 00:12:13,444
would be Takuma because he can't carry bodies,

264
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:15,305
he cannot climb, he cannot kill anyone,

265
00:12:15,606 --> 00:12:17,627
but he's extremely powerful aside from that.

266
00:12:18,267 --> 00:12:19,708
All of his skills are very strong.

267
00:12:19,748 --> 00:12:21,689
The tanuki is the strongest distraction in the game.

268
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:24,271
The grenade, the normal one is not as good,

269
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:25,792
but you can switch it to a stun grenade,

270
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,032
which is completely overpowered.

271
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,534
Yeah, the snipe is just strong.

272
00:12:31,674 --> 00:12:32,974
Alright, so that's enough for characters.

273
00:12:33,174 --> 00:12:36,495
I'm going to do sort of a deep dive into one game design topic

274
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:38,176
between each of these broader topics.

275
00:12:38,476 --> 00:12:40,416
It's supposed to be a warp vortex,

276
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:41,577
but it looks more like a snake.

277
00:12:42,217 --> 00:12:43,257
A snail, I'm sorry.

278
00:12:44,057 --> 00:12:45,918
Alright, for this one I'm going to talk about shadow mode,

279
00:12:46,118 --> 00:12:47,618
which is a prominent feature in the game.

280
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:51,978
Something that's very important to us is that you're playing a team, right?

281
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:53,199
This was one of the pillars we had.

282
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:55,401
You shouldn't feel like there's individuals running around.

283
00:12:55,461 --> 00:12:57,643
It should be like a team that is working together,

284
00:12:57,703 --> 00:13:01,786
because this sort of is different from any stealth games where you're just by yourself usually.

285
00:13:02,227 --> 00:13:05,109
And so what we thought of in the beginning is that we make team actions,

286
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:09,052
which would be like two characters working together and creating this new skill.

287
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:10,894
And this would be true for every character.

288
00:13:10,974 --> 00:13:13,276
Every character combination would have their own team action.

289
00:13:14,123 --> 00:13:16,046
Desperados did that in one of their sequels.

290
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:18,531
It did not work out for them, and I know why now,

291
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:19,593
because we tried it as well.

292
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:25,344
The problem with this is that team actions.

293
00:13:26,737 --> 00:13:28,337
add a lot of complexity to the game.

294
00:13:29,097 --> 00:13:30,458
It's hard enough already, I mean,

295
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,618
every character has two skills you have to learn, right?

296
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:33,879
The distraction and the special.

297
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:35,659
And that is hard enough for people already.

298
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:38,320
It would take them a long time to really get the hang

299
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
of how to use a character.

300
00:13:39,641 --> 00:13:42,401
Now imagine if we add five to 10 skills on top of that

301
00:13:42,441 --> 00:13:43,842
that are just very situational,

302
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:45,142
you can't even use them all the time.

303
00:13:45,422 --> 00:13:48,344
and you have to try to learn those and really use them,

304
00:13:48,484 --> 00:13:49,725
that was not gonna work.

305
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,228
And the second one was that we had a couple of good examples

306
00:13:53,268 --> 00:13:53,949
for team action.

307
00:13:53,969 --> 00:13:57,172
For example, we had the idea that Aiko could use Mugen

308
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,053
sort of as act like he's her husband

309
00:13:59,093 --> 00:14:01,215
and sort of shuttle him through enemy vision

310
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:02,796
because they wouldn't think he's suspicious

311
00:14:03,237 --> 00:14:05,619
or Mugen could bunk up other characters

312
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:06,900
and help them climb like a ladder.

313
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:10,703
But it sort of stopped after that

314
00:14:10,923 --> 00:14:12,284
and we would have needed 10 or more.

315
00:14:12,465 --> 00:14:14,066
So yeah, we scrapped that.

316
00:14:14,924 --> 00:14:16,284
And we did the planning mode thing.

317
00:14:16,444 --> 00:14:17,885
That also existed in Desperados.

318
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:18,865
It was a little hard to use

319
00:14:19,065 --> 00:14:20,766
because the controls were not as tight,

320
00:14:21,886 --> 00:14:23,206
and they are for us as well.

321
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:25,467
But the idea behind the planning mode,

322
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:27,707
if you don't know it, is that you can plan one action

323
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:28,808
for each character you have,

324
00:14:29,608 --> 00:14:31,508
and then have them executed at a later time,

325
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,169
together or separate.

326
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:37,833
This is very important for gamepad controls.

327
00:14:38,113 --> 00:14:39,413
We knew from the beginning that we're gonna do

328
00:14:39,433 --> 00:14:41,514
a console version, so we worked on gamepad controls

329
00:14:41,654 --> 00:14:42,215
from the beginning.

330
00:14:43,095 --> 00:14:45,156
And it is very different because you control

331
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,997
the character directly, right?

332
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:48,738
It's very immersive in that case.

333
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:53,380
So on a computer you could simply just send

334
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,681
a character somewhere and do something else

335
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:58,182
with another character, but on a gamepad you can't

336
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,063
because you have to control the character yourself.

337
00:15:00,403 --> 00:15:01,904
So shadow mode becomes very important

338
00:15:02,064 --> 00:15:03,045
if you're playing with a gamepad.

339
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:04,345
And...

340
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:07,649
And what it turned out to be is sort of a do-it-yourself team action.

341
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:10,831
And it was brilliant because we didn't have to teach you any new skills.

342
00:15:10,871 --> 00:15:14,594
You could basically use the skills that you already knew, combine them, make the game

343
00:15:14,654 --> 00:15:18,217
feel like a team game, and voila, everything worked out well.

344
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:22,020
And I think this is also some of the most powerful moments in the game are when you

345
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,661
pull off a successful shadow mode.

346
00:15:23,701 --> 00:15:25,203
So that worked out well.

347
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:31,087
And something that often comes up is the question why we only have one action that you can save.

348
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:32,488
And why not infinite actions?

349
00:15:32,528 --> 00:15:33,489
It would be so much cooler.

350
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,541
We actually had that during development and it had a couple of problems.

351
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:41,423
It was pretty awesome, I have to admit it.

352
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:44,524
Like if you saw people just doing these insane things

353
00:15:44,584 --> 00:15:47,025
where they would make insane queues and chains of

354
00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:49,446
I throw a shuriken there, I walk over there, I use my stone,

355
00:15:49,466 --> 00:15:51,587
the shuriken, I pick it up again, the cooldown,

356
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:54,708
and they would do insane things and basically clear parts of the whole map

357
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:55,549
just in shadow mode.

358
00:15:56,369 --> 00:16:00,011
And that was fun, but that's not how we want you to play our game.

359
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:03,052
In our game a very important aspect is the real-time aspect.

360
00:16:03,347 --> 00:16:04,768
And it's the aspect of execution.

361
00:16:05,068 --> 00:16:07,148
You cannot just plan like in a turn-based game,

362
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:08,449
but you have to execute as well.

363
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:10,209
And if Shadow Mode is that powerful,

364
00:16:10,229 --> 00:16:11,530
you don't have to execute anymore.

365
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,411
You just plan it and you look and see what happens.

366
00:16:15,331 --> 00:16:17,292
And the other one was that the more complexity

367
00:16:17,332 --> 00:16:20,313
the feature had, the more tools players wanted

368
00:16:20,353 --> 00:16:20,933
to work with it.

369
00:16:20,993 --> 00:16:23,734
So they wanted timelines where they could rearrange

370
00:16:23,754 --> 00:16:25,014
the actions they had set,

371
00:16:25,094 --> 00:16:27,195
or they wanted a pause function where they say,

372
00:16:27,455 --> 00:16:29,436
you walk there and then you wait three seconds

373
00:16:29,476 --> 00:16:30,396
and then you do this action.

374
00:16:31,326 --> 00:16:34,150
And that would have been a nightmare from all sort of standpoints.

375
00:16:34,691 --> 00:16:35,933
So we didn't do it.

376
00:16:37,035 --> 00:16:39,378
And the lesson we learned is that less is more.

377
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:40,761
Wow, big lesson.

378
00:16:41,562 --> 00:16:42,884
I guess nobody heard that before.

379
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:43,705
But.

380
00:16:44,782 --> 00:16:46,904
The big part that was new for us was the fact

381
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,686
that what we actually had was fun, right?

382
00:16:48,726 --> 00:16:50,067
It was not something where you just have

383
00:16:50,407 --> 00:16:53,350
this huge pile of features, but a lot of stuff is added on

384
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,992
and somebody's coming, yeah, you should do less,

385
00:16:55,032 --> 00:16:55,673
that would be better.

386
00:16:56,013 --> 00:16:57,675
It was fun, it was a very good thing,

387
00:16:57,695 --> 00:16:59,957
and there's games who have this planning mode thing

388
00:16:59,997 --> 00:17:02,039
as their main mechanic, but it just wasn't our game,

389
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:04,642
so we had to cut it out, and the game's better for it.

390
00:17:06,603 --> 00:17:08,025
Let's talk about level design.

391
00:17:10,057 --> 00:17:11,098
I could talk a lot about that.

392
00:17:11,158 --> 00:17:12,620
It's going to be rather short, though,

393
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,623
because there's a lot going on in this talk.

394
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:18,126
This is the mission eight of the game.

395
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,428
And as you can see, the map is very big.

396
00:17:20,668 --> 00:17:21,469
You are this big.

397
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:23,832
If you can't see it, this is you.

398
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:29,910
So what is very important if you have a mission where people spend one to four hours on,

399
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,831
is that the mission is cool.

400
00:17:32,432 --> 00:17:35,474
As soon as the mission is bad or boring, they're probably going to stop playing your game

401
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,996
because they know they have to spend a couple of hours on that mission.

402
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,538
And they also have to be very unique.

403
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:43,199
And this is sort of the first big thing that we wanted to do.

404
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:45,881
And this is something that Commandos 2 does the best, I guess.

405
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:47,883
They have very unique settings and great maps.

406
00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:49,604
So we took that inspiration.

407
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:53,877
And the idea is basically that if you and a friend have played the game,

408
00:17:53,897 --> 00:17:56,558
this is sort of a test you can make to see if your maps are unique,

409
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:00,500
if you can describe to them a mission with one or two words

410
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,161
and they know which one you're talking about instantly,

411
00:18:03,521 --> 00:18:05,222
then it's probably unique enough.

412
00:18:06,343 --> 00:18:10,345
And the important thing about this is that we did also not want you to...

413
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:14,357
get into a new map and realized it's the same thing again.

414
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:17,059
And you know you have to play that for two hours now.

415
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:19,380
So that was very important that things look differently.

416
00:18:19,661 --> 00:18:21,202
I'm gonna talk about that a little bit more later

417
00:18:21,222 --> 00:18:22,142
when I talk about pacing.

418
00:18:24,464 --> 00:18:26,446
Another big thing was the emotional state

419
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:28,187
that you want you to be in if you play a mission.

420
00:18:28,427 --> 00:18:30,729
This is very high level, but it's important to know that

421
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:32,810
like if you wanna be consistent.

422
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:39,322
So if you open up the mission, you're very very happy. Everything is new. It's looking gorgeous. You're scrolling over the whole map

423
00:18:39,342 --> 00:18:42,664
You're like, oh wow, this is beautiful. Look at that landmark. Look at this nice building

424
00:18:43,004 --> 00:18:48,446
Look at this and then it sort of dawns to you that you have to actually play all of this and you see things

425
00:18:48,486 --> 00:18:53,589
Like oh my god, there's some Samurai over there. There's a huge patrol of guys. How am I ever going to?

426
00:18:54,557 --> 00:18:56,057
and you want to quit, but then you're like,

427
00:18:56,137 --> 00:18:57,077
okay, no, I can do this.

428
00:18:57,778 --> 00:19:00,358
I've had certain missions before, I can do this one as well,

429
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:02,839
and then you enter in the emotional core loop of our game,

430
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:05,820
which is basically utter despair into happiness,

431
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,461
into I can do this, and many quick saves,

432
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:10,321
and maybe rage quits in between.

433
00:19:11,462 --> 00:19:14,142
And in the end, you feel like a god.

434
00:19:14,502 --> 00:19:16,183
You're in a purple cloud of puffiness,

435
00:19:16,383 --> 00:19:18,924
and you're very happy, and the big thing is

436
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:20,564
that you can scroll over the whole map

437
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:21,885
that you have actually just completed,

438
00:19:21,945 --> 00:19:23,225
and see everything that you've done.

439
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,378
This is important, and this is very, very good.

440
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:27,900
And we want that.

441
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,282
We could have done more in that department, I think.

442
00:19:30,322 --> 00:19:32,003
We could have added to the stats screen

443
00:19:32,023 --> 00:19:33,185
some sort of replay function

444
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,926
where you can just see what actually happened,

445
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:36,388
and you did this there, and you did that.

446
00:19:36,448 --> 00:19:38,690
That's something we're probably gonna do for our next game.

447
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:42,673
Yeah, but this is very, very important,

448
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:45,957
and giving you that feeling of satisfaction in the end.

449
00:19:47,078 --> 00:19:48,619
So basically, every mission is the same

450
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:50,521
as doing a small setup, right?

451
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:53,656
And I want to talk about openness a little bit.

452
00:19:54,137 --> 00:19:55,577
One of our key pillars in the game,

453
00:19:55,597 --> 00:19:57,717
the level design, was that you should

454
00:19:58,018 --> 00:19:59,138
be able to play it your way.

455
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,719
Everybody should have the chance to play different

456
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:04,039
things, and every puzzle had to play different

457
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:05,640
approaches. And this doesn't only

458
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,860
apply to the small enemy setups, but also

459
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,061
to the whole map. This is Mission 5.

460
00:20:10,161 --> 00:20:11,401
It's the first mission that we built.

461
00:20:11,421 --> 00:20:12,921
It was sort of a vertical slice.

462
00:20:14,102 --> 00:20:15,602
And I think it's one of the best, which is

463
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:17,843
awkward, because we didn't learn much,

464
00:20:17,963 --> 00:20:18,223
I guess.

465
00:20:20,243 --> 00:20:20,383
But...

466
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:25,266
In the beginning it's very linear, you get up to this gate and then the mission basically opens up.

467
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:26,847
And you can go left or you can go right.

468
00:20:26,907 --> 00:20:29,270
And the briefing tells you this, right? It tells you there's two paths.

469
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,513
And something that's very important if you're designing for openness

470
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:34,555
is that you actually show players the paths.

471
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:38,719
If you have 20 paths but they're all obfuscated and you're like,

472
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:40,701
yeah, the player has to be clever and find them,

473
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,983
then they won't look and they won't find them

474
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:46,326
and they won't realize that this is an open game and they will think it's linear.

475
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:48,788
So what we always try to do is something like this T-shape,

476
00:20:48,808 --> 00:20:50,409
where we say, OK, you can go left, you can go right.

477
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,832
And also be aware of the fact that you are not

478
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:56,253
losing content if they are not playing the other part.

479
00:20:56,894 --> 00:20:59,135
The choice is only meaningful because they

480
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,516
don't get to play the part, right?

481
00:21:00,757 --> 00:21:02,578
If they would end up in the same thing anyway,

482
00:21:02,598 --> 00:21:03,779
there wouldn't be a choice, and the game

483
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:05,380
wouldn't feel open or good at all.

484
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,761
Plus, you can always have replayability.

485
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:09,703
If the player chooses to play this mission again,

486
00:21:09,723 --> 00:21:10,964
they will choose the other path and have

487
00:21:10,984 --> 00:21:12,184
a completely different experience.

488
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:15,345
And there also are obfuscated paths in this mission.

489
00:21:15,865 --> 00:21:18,227
You can just go straight ahead and climb up the building,

490
00:21:18,267 --> 00:21:19,728
but most people don't find that.

491
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:23,251
But it's cool, because if you replay it, you might find that.

492
00:21:23,271 --> 00:21:24,052
You might feel clever.

493
00:21:24,072 --> 00:21:25,633
We don't tell it to you in a briefing,

494
00:21:25,673 --> 00:21:27,735
and we do that sort of stuff a lot.

495
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,677
I want to talk about bottlenecks, because if everything was very open and you didn't

496
00:21:32,697 --> 00:21:36,320
have any bottlenecks, then the game would be very boring, especially ours, because people

497
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,102
could just sneak through everything and leave everything behind.

498
00:21:39,943 --> 00:21:44,467
So how do we do bottlenecks and how do we make them still fun and not feel frustrating?

499
00:21:44,987 --> 00:21:48,770
So the first thing that we do is basically bottlenecks always revolve around Takuma or

500
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:52,873
Mugen who cannot climb or swim, so you always have to drag them through, sort of.

501
00:21:54,752 --> 00:21:56,733
In this case, this is the bottleneck.

502
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,014
You have to get Takuma to this sniper tower on the left,

503
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:01,095
but he cannot swim, so he has to go over that thing.

504
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:04,856
And what's important here is that while it is a bottleneck

505
00:22:04,876 --> 00:22:07,617
to get Takuma there, you have infinite possibilities

506
00:22:07,657 --> 00:22:09,598
with your other characters on how to solve that thing.

507
00:22:09,618 --> 00:22:11,319
You can swim around the whole island,

508
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,879
you can get out anywhere you want to,

509
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,560
and approach the setup in a very, very open way,

510
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:16,961
and there are multiple solutions to it.

511
00:22:17,241 --> 00:22:19,362
So it doesn't really feel like a bad bottleneck

512
00:22:19,382 --> 00:22:20,762
where you're like, I have to do this now.

513
00:22:21,363 --> 00:22:23,083
It still feels open, and you can be creative.

514
00:22:24,183 --> 00:22:27,065
So, yeah, that's enough for level design.

515
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:29,887
Let's do another deep dive thingy.

516
00:22:30,588 --> 00:22:33,150
Something that we learned, which is also pretty obvious, I guess,

517
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,292
for many people, but it's about how people approach

518
00:22:36,392 --> 00:22:37,693
problem solving in your game.

519
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:41,436
So we have a player, and the player faces a problem.

520
00:22:41,556 --> 00:22:43,358
In our case, usually a setup of some guards.

521
00:22:44,482 --> 00:22:48,803
And there is this assumption players have on how they are approaching a problem in our game,

522
00:22:48,843 --> 00:22:51,423
because it's called Shadow Tactics, it's a tactical game, right?

523
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:55,664
You have strategy, you're in this view, in this RTS view where you can see everything.

524
00:22:55,704 --> 00:22:58,985
So people think that they're actually approaching problems very holistically,

525
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:02,626
and checking everything out, and then narrowing it down, and then starting to work,

526
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:03,966
but that is not what they're doing.

527
00:23:04,407 --> 00:23:09,268
In reality, they do this. They see a guard, and this is the circle, sort of the tactical horizon,

528
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,388
things they actually see.

529
00:23:12,068 --> 00:23:13,389
And they just go in and kill the guard,

530
00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:14,869
and then they get seen and they quick load.

531
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,710
And they see, okay, this guy is in there,

532
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,850
so they add that guy to their horizon, sort of.

533
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:21,571
And they keep doing that over and over

534
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:23,711
until they have actually understood how the setup works.

535
00:23:25,052 --> 00:23:26,652
And it is very important to understand that,

536
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:27,752
because they might tell you

537
00:23:27,812 --> 00:23:29,973
that they are playing very strategically,

538
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,093
but they are usually not.

539
00:23:31,173 --> 00:23:33,414
I'm sure that many people are, but many weren't.

540
00:23:34,474 --> 00:23:36,175
And what this meant for our level design was,

541
00:23:36,579 --> 00:23:39,080
that we had to make sure that things are not too far away

542
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,201
from the center of attention that you're actually playing in.

543
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:43,882
For example, we don't have large patrols

544
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,883
that are going like many minutes around the map

545
00:23:46,303 --> 00:23:47,844
because that would just be bad.

546
00:23:47,864 --> 00:23:49,805
You would play the game and then suddenly they would come in

547
00:23:49,865 --> 00:23:51,485
and screw everything up for you.

548
00:23:52,326 --> 00:23:54,867
And we try to have guards close to each other.

549
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:58,688
And this doesn't work all the time, but we tried doing that.

550
00:24:02,413 --> 00:24:06,815
Another thing we did here was that we cleared off the areas very clear.

551
00:24:06,975 --> 00:24:10,275
So you cannot see from one area into the other.

552
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:12,976
You can always rely on the fact that if you are in one area,

553
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:17,517
guards from another area will not disturb you, at least most of the time.

554
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:20,998
So the lesson we learned here is that what people tell you

555
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:23,378
about how they approach problems in the game is not really true.

556
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,699
And we thought about why this is the case in our game,

557
00:24:26,739 --> 00:24:28,980
and it's very clear we could have seen that from the beginning

558
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,940
because shadow tactics is very iterative, right?

559
00:24:31,964 --> 00:24:33,844
We teach you to quick save all the time,

560
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:35,985
so there's basically no punishment for failure.

561
00:24:36,045 --> 00:24:37,486
The game screams that at you.

562
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:38,706
It's like, just try things out.

563
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:41,067
The quick load time is very low, just keep going.

564
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:44,429
And of course they don't think holistically

565
00:24:44,489 --> 00:24:46,849
and watch everything because they don't have to, right?

566
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:47,930
And it's in our core mechanics,

567
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,090
and we could have seen that earlier.

568
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:51,591
Story.

569
00:24:51,611 --> 00:24:53,992
I'm gonna drink something real quick.

570
00:24:54,913 --> 00:24:56,533
So, the most important rule.

571
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,560
we had for our story was that the plot is not important,

572
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,901
but the characters are important.

573
00:25:04,001 --> 00:25:06,743
And the plot had to work with many, many restrictions

574
00:25:07,143 --> 00:25:08,984
from a game design and level design standpoint.

575
00:25:09,024 --> 00:25:10,305
I'm gonna talk about that in a bit.

576
00:25:10,645 --> 00:25:12,145
So it's structured very simple

577
00:25:12,366 --> 00:25:14,947
and it had to facilitate certain things.

578
00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:17,808
It's basically the Shogun is fighting Kagesama,

579
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:19,809
who's this ominous bad guy.

580
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:20,750
You don't know who he is.

581
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,491
And the important part here is that

582
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:28,964
The Shogun can send you anywhere because we have these missions where you're on a mountaintop,

583
00:25:29,004 --> 00:25:34,129
it's winter, oh, you're at a lake, it's summer, and it's impossible to tell a story that feels

584
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:36,952
like a journey very much if you have a structure like that.

585
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:40,016
That's what I talked about with the different settings before, that we want every map to

586
00:25:40,056 --> 00:25:40,877
feel fresh and new.

587
00:25:41,257 --> 00:25:42,899
This is a big hit for the story, right?

588
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:44,541
You cannot do certain things then.

589
00:25:45,401 --> 00:25:47,023
And that's why we...

590
00:25:48,117 --> 00:25:50,099
And also the characters that you have in a mission

591
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,440
are not defined by the story.

592
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,122
They are very much defined by the pacing,

593
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:55,144
so the writer can't just say,

594
00:25:55,184 --> 00:25:56,745
yeah, I want this character to be here

595
00:25:56,826 --> 00:25:58,127
because he will not be there.

596
00:25:59,668 --> 00:26:02,011
So we did this mostly in cut scenes, the plot thing.

597
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:05,034
Between the missions you get a cut scene and that's that.

598
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:09,378
But the more important part of storytelling that we had

599
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:11,781
is about our characters and how we talk about them.

600
00:26:12,433 --> 00:26:15,535
The first thing we do is we have something like we call context dialogues,

601
00:26:15,655 --> 00:26:19,317
sort of a dialogue that either triggers if you walk into a volume with the player character,

602
00:26:19,677 --> 00:26:23,340
or if you do an action, you kill a guard, whatever, then these banter things trigger.

603
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,142
And they are very weird because we're in Edo, Japan, this is very early,

604
00:26:28,342 --> 00:26:31,604
and they sort of have Skype, they can just talk to each other over the whole map.

605
00:26:32,304 --> 00:26:34,866
And some people are offended by that and they don't like it, but...

606
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,342
Realize that people want your characters to talk to each other,

607
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:40,884
so they will have a lot higher suspension of disbelief

608
00:26:41,124 --> 00:26:43,726
if something like this happens, if you do it right.

609
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:46,408
And we had certain things that we had to change

610
00:26:47,328 --> 00:26:51,632
and had to work into the game that would make this less awkward.

611
00:26:51,672 --> 00:26:54,033
For example, when a character walks into a trigger volume

612
00:26:54,094 --> 00:26:55,575
and one of these dialogues triggers,

613
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:58,883
it's always that correct character that starts talking.

614
00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:00,344
So every dialogue is written in a way

615
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:02,205
that there's a beginning line for each character

616
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:04,307
in the mission, and then the dialogue will go on.

617
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:05,948
And this way it feels less awkward

618
00:27:05,968 --> 00:27:08,009
because sort of you are initiating the dialogue

619
00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:10,391
and it's not someone screaming at you from 400 meters away.

620
00:27:11,892 --> 00:27:13,613
And this worked out really well, I think,

621
00:27:13,653 --> 00:27:15,715
and we got a lot of character things across

622
00:27:15,775 --> 00:27:18,136
with that and the personalities.

623
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:19,677
And the other one is...

624
00:27:21,837 --> 00:27:22,838
We call them player barks.

625
00:27:23,378 --> 00:27:25,299
Barks are many things, so you might not

626
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:26,459
call them that in your studio.

627
00:27:26,499 --> 00:27:29,200
But it's when you select the character, what they say

628
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,601
when you use a shuriken or whatever.

629
00:27:30,921 --> 00:27:34,022
This work, work, yes, my lord stuff from Warcraft 3

630
00:27:34,382 --> 00:27:35,463
would be an example of that.

631
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:38,404
And we try to use that for storytelling in something

632
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:40,625
I haven't seen as much, and I wonder why,

633
00:27:40,685 --> 00:27:42,706
because it's the best way to do it.

634
00:27:43,946 --> 00:27:46,287
Something very bad happens at some point in your story.

635
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,540
After that, for two missions, we sort of completely

636
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,541
swapped the dialogue lines your characters say

637
00:27:52,221 --> 00:27:54,822
if you use them and make them walk around or use skills,

638
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:56,382
because they are depressed.

639
00:27:56,662 --> 00:28:00,543
Because it would be very awkward if you have depressed dialogue

640
00:28:00,563 --> 00:28:02,144
where he's like, oh my god, I'm so sad.

641
00:28:02,524 --> 00:28:03,304
This is so bad.

642
00:28:03,324 --> 00:28:04,024
And then you select them.

643
00:28:04,044 --> 00:28:05,605
He's like, yes, sir, I'm going to do that.

644
00:28:06,305 --> 00:28:07,285
It doesn't feel right.

645
00:28:08,085 --> 00:28:10,486
And I think we could have done a lot more with that, used that.

646
00:28:11,527 --> 00:28:12,948
changing this stuff up a little more.

647
00:28:13,128 --> 00:28:14,248
Well, we did it a little bit with,

648
00:28:14,689 --> 00:28:16,810
there's a snow map, they might say things like,

649
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,512
there's snow in my armor, but I think

650
00:28:19,632 --> 00:28:22,353
from an emotional standpoint, this is a very underused tool

651
00:28:22,614 --> 00:28:25,395
in RTS-like games that you can do very much with.

652
00:28:28,437 --> 00:28:28,978
Pacing.

653
00:28:30,018 --> 00:28:31,579
I'm realizing I'm talking very fast,

654
00:28:31,699 --> 00:28:33,641
so I might slow down a bit.

655
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:36,703
I don't see much about pacing,

656
00:28:36,743 --> 00:28:38,464
so this might be very, very basic,

657
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:40,305
and you might get bored now, but,

658
00:28:41,713 --> 00:28:44,894
It's an important thing to me and also for our game,

659
00:28:44,914 --> 00:28:45,934
so I wanted to talk about it.

660
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,535
And if anybody of you is into that stuff,

661
00:28:48,575 --> 00:28:50,196
like pacing of the whole game, talk to me,

662
00:28:50,216 --> 00:28:51,916
I wanna learn, I want new things.

663
00:28:52,936 --> 00:28:55,417
So Shadow Tactics is about 25 hours long.

664
00:28:56,598 --> 00:28:59,659
And the biggest fear I had all the time

665
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:01,619
was that people would get bored halfway through,

666
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:03,920
because there is not very much in the game, actually.

667
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,881
We have three enemy types, right?

668
00:29:07,053 --> 00:29:09,457
They are basically all the same, they just react differently.

669
00:29:09,537 --> 00:29:12,823
But they don't have different weapons or huge different behaviors.

670
00:29:12,883 --> 00:29:15,608
In the beginning, we had concepts of guards like that would maybe.

671
00:29:16,219 --> 00:29:19,221
gun around with torches and sort of burn the bushes you're hiding in,

672
00:29:19,261 --> 00:29:22,383
and ninja characters that hide in bushes, and we cut all of that,

673
00:29:22,443 --> 00:29:23,663
nothing of that made it into the game.

674
00:29:23,984 --> 00:29:26,225
So it's very simple, and we only have three guard types,

675
00:29:26,325 --> 00:29:29,907
so it's not much variety coming from that, right?

676
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:33,489
Then we have five characters, but we introduced them in the first third of the game,

677
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:35,370
and they do not change at all.

678
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,371
There is no progression, there is no leveling up,

679
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:39,292
there is no skills that you can choose.

680
00:29:39,392 --> 00:29:41,253
It's just the same character from start to finish.

681
00:29:42,466 --> 00:29:46,615
So how are we going to keep the player interested for 25 hours or more?

682
00:29:47,797 --> 00:29:51,444
And the first big thing we did is that we invented sort of, well we didn't invent them,

683
00:29:51,465 --> 00:29:54,170
we stole them from Commandos and so on, but, and we had these

684
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:58,816
high impact features that completely change the gameplay,

685
00:29:58,836 --> 00:29:59,636
the core gameplay.

686
00:29:59,656 --> 00:30:00,897
And one of them is the night time,

687
00:30:01,017 --> 00:30:02,679
where the lights become very important,

688
00:30:02,699 --> 00:30:03,899
the shadows become important,

689
00:30:03,939 --> 00:30:06,361
which is something that is irrelevant on most maps,

690
00:30:07,262 --> 00:30:08,122
on day maps, I mean.

691
00:30:08,843 --> 00:30:10,364
And then you have the footprint mechanic,

692
00:30:10,384 --> 00:30:12,485
where snow is lying and guards can see your footprints

693
00:30:12,525 --> 00:30:13,286
and they will follow you up.

694
00:30:13,626 --> 00:30:16,048
And this really changes how you play a mission a lot.

695
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:17,869
And we had these two things.

696
00:30:18,189 --> 00:30:19,010
We thought about others,

697
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,191
like adding fog of war maybe to some missions,

698
00:30:21,332 --> 00:30:22,412
which sadly never made it.

699
00:30:22,432 --> 00:30:23,793
It's something I want to try, but.

700
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:26,066
There's technical limitations with that.

701
00:30:26,106 --> 00:30:29,269
And it's difficult with the fog of war and a view cone,

702
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:31,732
right, because the guard, you cannot see the guard,

703
00:30:31,752 --> 00:30:32,493
but he can see you.

704
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:33,954
So that would have been very bad.

705
00:30:35,716 --> 00:30:38,158
So we did this thing, and we paste these out very carefully.

706
00:30:38,178 --> 00:30:39,259
I'm going to show you that in a minute.

707
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,740
And we try to not overuse them.

708
00:30:42,362 --> 00:30:44,945
And then we have some sort of story high points in a mission.

709
00:30:45,005 --> 00:30:46,606
Usually, mechanically, the missions

710
00:30:46,646 --> 00:30:48,348
where we have these big assassinations,

711
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:48,848
like you kill.

712
00:30:49,676 --> 00:30:53,918
Koto, you kill Iyabu or Kagesama in the end.

713
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:56,580
There is not much going on from a mechanical standpoint.

714
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,181
We don't introduce new features there.

715
00:30:58,221 --> 00:30:59,741
We don't introduce new characters.

716
00:31:00,082 --> 00:31:02,923
They're just, like you learn stuff,

717
00:31:03,043 --> 00:31:04,424
now use it and kill this guy.

718
00:31:04,544 --> 00:31:06,105
But you have an emotional high point there

719
00:31:06,145 --> 00:31:08,206
because story-wise it's pretty cool.

720
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:09,827
So this is important for pacing as well.

721
00:31:10,627 --> 00:31:13,109
Especially balancing these two things against each other.

722
00:31:13,969 --> 00:31:14,970
We have these graphs that.

723
00:31:15,343 --> 00:31:20,526
I sadly didn't bring because I thought I would be a lot slower and didn't have time for it.

724
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:25,769
So basically the idea was that we have these high impact features like this or introducing

725
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:28,091
a character and we would assign a value to that, right?

726
00:31:28,531 --> 00:31:32,253
And then we would see in every mission how many high impact features are there, how many

727
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,714
medium impact features are there.

728
00:31:33,734 --> 00:31:34,235
For example.

729
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:37,016
puddles that you can go into that make a noise.

730
00:31:37,056 --> 00:31:38,537
They don't change the game completely,

731
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:39,598
but they change it up a bit.

732
00:31:40,018 --> 00:31:41,078
And so we get this value,

733
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:43,680
and then we can make a graph out of that

734
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,961
and see how much is going on from a mechanic standpoint

735
00:31:45,981 --> 00:31:46,542
in every mission.

736
00:31:46,902 --> 00:31:48,323
It's good for tutorial stuff,

737
00:31:48,503 --> 00:31:50,424
and also just to see how the pacing turns out.

738
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:53,086
And then you base that against how the excitement

739
00:31:53,126 --> 00:31:54,927
of the player is when he just opens the mission,

740
00:31:54,987 --> 00:31:56,828
or if the story does something crazy.

741
00:31:56,948 --> 00:31:58,709
So you balance these out with each other,

742
00:31:58,729 --> 00:31:59,810
and then you get a nice pacing.

743
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,787
So this is the Excel file we used.

744
00:32:02,828 --> 00:32:03,749
It's actually pretty simple.

745
00:32:04,411 --> 00:32:05,313
There's not much going on.

746
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,039
But I still wanna just go over it.

747
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,985
Probably you guys have much more complex stuff,

748
00:32:11,446 --> 00:32:11,987
but we'll see.

749
00:32:13,842 --> 00:32:15,723
This is the setting stuff I talked about earlier.

750
00:32:16,944 --> 00:32:18,464
As you can see, we tried to paste them out.

751
00:32:18,584 --> 00:32:21,245
There is a bunch of village settings in the middle,

752
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:22,946
but they are very, very different.

753
00:32:23,326 --> 00:32:25,407
One of them is very snowy, it's raining,

754
00:32:25,447 --> 00:32:26,327
it's a very bad mood.

755
00:32:26,387 --> 00:32:28,608
One of them is the fifth mission I showed you before.

756
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:31,590
And they are sort of, yeah, they're different,

757
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:32,790
so don't get fooled by that.

758
00:32:33,711 --> 00:32:35,231
You can see there's the moon down there,

759
00:32:35,491 --> 00:32:36,772
which I might show you at the end.

760
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,958
Yeah, we tried to be very careful with the settings

761
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,539
to paste them out in a way that it always felt fresh

762
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:46,420
and you didn't play in the same area

763
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,320
or the same visual style for too long

764
00:32:48,821 --> 00:32:50,641
and never one mission after the other.

765
00:32:52,162 --> 00:32:54,182
This is the night and the snow gameplay.

766
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:56,323
You can see we don't use it that often

767
00:32:56,543 --> 00:32:58,004
and we usually paste it at a point

768
00:32:58,064 --> 00:33:00,004
where you don't get a new character or anything else.

769
00:33:00,464 --> 00:33:01,605
If there's not much going on,

770
00:33:01,665 --> 00:33:03,545
then we introduce something like snow

771
00:33:03,745 --> 00:33:04,846
or we introduce something like...

772
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,578
the night gameplay in the Lake Village.

773
00:33:08,138 --> 00:33:10,941
And we do this once, twice, and then once and twice again,

774
00:33:11,021 --> 00:33:13,384
and then we have a mission with both, and that's it.

775
00:33:13,724 --> 00:33:15,706
We don't try to push it, we don't try to overuse it,

776
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:17,788
because then the feature would get old and boring.

777
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:20,811
And this is the most important thing we had for pacing.

778
00:33:20,971 --> 00:33:22,493
It's the characters that you have in a mission.

779
00:33:24,541 --> 00:33:27,703
People always want to choose their own characters for a mission.

780
00:33:27,743 --> 00:33:31,385
They want to be like, yeah, I want to, this will add so much depth, right?

781
00:33:31,445 --> 00:33:33,906
I could choose the game and play the game in very different ways.

782
00:33:34,006 --> 00:33:37,509
But what would actually happen is that normal players would just stick to what

783
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:37,889
they know.

784
00:33:38,069 --> 00:33:40,450
They would just choose the character they like the most and

785
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,211
then the game would get boring very quickly.

786
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:44,813
So it's very important that we have the power to sort of,

787
00:33:45,193 --> 00:33:48,075
we have higher to two missions and you get used to a skill set and boom,

788
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:50,116
we take them away and you have to sort of deal with that.

789
00:33:50,836 --> 00:33:53,238
And that is the most important tool of pacing we have.

790
00:33:54,174 --> 00:34:02,720
If you can find something like that in your game where you sort of can control how the game plays extremely well like this and then use that feature, it's the best thing you have.

791
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:08,044
And what you can see is that we have only two missions that actually have the same character setup.

792
00:34:08,264 --> 00:34:10,726
So, well, you can't really see it because it's very confusing.

793
00:34:11,187 --> 00:34:14,129
I had to count that like five times myself to not lie to you.

794
00:34:14,669 --> 00:34:15,870
But it's only these two missions.

795
00:34:18,271 --> 00:34:19,732
Next to that you can see the mission objectives,

796
00:34:19,752 --> 00:34:21,274
we tried to balance those out as well,

797
00:34:21,354 --> 00:34:23,375
that you don't have like three assassinations missions

798
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:26,438
in a row, and while they mostly are the same,

799
00:34:26,578 --> 00:34:28,760
that you always have to get to some point and do something,

800
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:32,023
it's still important that the vision and the feeling

801
00:34:32,043 --> 00:34:33,885
the player has is very different in each mission.

802
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:35,986
And on the right you can see some play time,

803
00:34:36,026 --> 00:34:38,308
we also put, like, the thing is a lot bigger,

804
00:34:38,428 --> 00:34:40,690
I just cut it down, and this is the first playthrough

805
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,912
and the second playthrough from the team,

806
00:34:42,212 --> 00:34:43,353
whatever, it's not really relevant.

807
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:52,032
So, the last deep dive I have right now, it's about one of the most important features in the game, which is the quicksave.

808
00:34:54,413 --> 00:35:04,159
We were very, very afraid regarding the quicksave, because we thought that it's a very old school type of thing, it's very retro, and we didn't know how, especially reviewers would react to it, right?

809
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:05,160
What they think it's a...

810
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,494
It's bad design that we didn't really do our job properly

811
00:35:08,534 --> 00:35:10,196
because you don't do that anymore, right?

812
00:35:10,497 --> 00:35:11,378
The safe scumming thing.

813
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,243
And we got afraid and we sort of thought about features

814
00:35:15,303 --> 00:35:16,966
that we could implement that would sort of.

815
00:35:18,394 --> 00:35:19,755
remove the quick save.

816
00:35:20,175 --> 00:35:21,817
We knew we would have it, but we tried

817
00:35:21,857 --> 00:35:24,919
to make it less important for a long time during development.

818
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,582
And an example for this is the biggest story

819
00:35:27,602 --> 00:35:29,063
of design failure we have in the game.

820
00:35:29,103 --> 00:35:30,124
It's called Freeze Mode.

821
00:35:30,544 --> 00:35:32,085
It never shipped, obviously.

822
00:35:32,886 --> 00:35:35,008
And we worked on that for about a year, I think.

823
00:35:35,148 --> 00:35:36,449
And we had so many iterations.

824
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,590
The basic idea was this.

825
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,253
Once you get seen, we don't want you to quick load.

826
00:35:40,293 --> 00:35:41,554
We want to give you a second chance.

827
00:35:42,855 --> 00:35:45,377
maybe just keep playing, we don't want the game to end,

828
00:35:45,437 --> 00:35:47,919
because especially Commandos 1 was very, very brutal

829
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:50,621
in that regard, and it's not that much fun for many players.

830
00:35:50,822 --> 00:35:52,783
There's some who like that, but they can play on hardcore.

831
00:35:53,564 --> 00:35:56,146
And the idea was that once you get seen,

832
00:35:56,346 --> 00:35:58,308
the game freezes, freeze mode,

833
00:35:58,868 --> 00:36:01,711
and you can choose that you can teleport somewhere.

834
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:03,412
The idea was sort of that the ninja

835
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:05,474
is using his smoke grenade and just disappears

836
00:36:05,534 --> 00:36:07,355
into thin air, which is a pretty cool move.

837
00:36:09,077 --> 00:36:10,078
It had multiple problems.

838
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,002
The first one is that if players get seen in our game,

839
00:36:14,082 --> 00:36:16,004
they usually get very excited and they start clicking

840
00:36:16,024 --> 00:36:17,765
really fast and try to get away or something.

841
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,287
And this is not when you want to freeze the game

842
00:36:20,327 --> 00:36:22,528
and force them to do a controlled input,

843
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:23,649
because they will not.

844
00:36:24,329 --> 00:36:26,231
They will just click through it and then they teleported

845
00:36:26,271 --> 00:36:27,532
somewhere and they don't know what happened

846
00:36:27,612 --> 00:36:28,772
and they were very frustrated.

847
00:36:29,693 --> 00:36:31,955
We could have fixed that, I guess, through input stuff,

848
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:35,437
but the basic principle of if someone is agitated,

849
00:36:35,457 --> 00:36:36,478
you force them to make a...

850
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:44,393
controlled input that just doesn't work. So we had that problem for all the iterations of the feature and

851
00:36:44,713 --> 00:36:46,033
the second big problem was

852
00:36:46,053 --> 00:36:48,494
I have to mention by the way that

853
00:36:49,315 --> 00:36:50,375
Many of you might think well

854
00:36:50,435 --> 00:36:54,217
Why didn't you just put a rewind time feature in the game that would solve all the problems?

855
00:36:54,657 --> 00:36:57,998
We talked about that and then we realized we cannot do that because it's very

856
00:36:58,547 --> 00:37:02,548
hardcore from a technical standpoint and would take a lot of our budget and also

857
00:37:03,128 --> 00:37:07,169
we didn't want a rewind time mechanic just to facilitate the quick save thing

858
00:37:07,209 --> 00:37:10,770
right would have needed a lot more mechanics to work into that and make it

859
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:16,571
a game about rewinding time like the games about rewinding time are yeah but

860
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:20,692
back to the problems with the freeze mode so the first problem was that as I

861
00:37:20,732 --> 00:37:22,173
said before people just click through it

862
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,911
And the second problem was that it added just a lot

863
00:37:24,931 --> 00:37:27,271
of complexity and possibilities to abuse,

864
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,172
because people would get seen in it,

865
00:37:29,352 --> 00:37:31,393
and then they would try to teleport somewhere

866
00:37:31,473 --> 00:37:32,534
advantageous for them.

867
00:37:32,634 --> 00:37:34,714
So they would sort of skip part of our gameplay

868
00:37:34,734 --> 00:37:36,075
and get seen on purpose,

869
00:37:36,155 --> 00:37:37,676
which is definitely not what you want.

870
00:37:39,236 --> 00:37:40,317
So we had to fix that in a way,

871
00:37:40,337 --> 00:37:41,797
and we made many iterations of that.

872
00:37:41,857 --> 00:37:44,078
At some point, you could only teleport back on a line

873
00:37:44,118 --> 00:37:45,479
where you would have been walking before,

874
00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:47,079
and just sort of go back.

875
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,000
But none of it worked,

876
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,361
and it always had the same problems.

877
00:37:50,641 --> 00:37:51,821
And so we ended up just,

878
00:37:52,462 --> 00:37:52,582
yeah.

879
00:37:52,902 --> 00:37:55,603
cutting the whole thing, well, we didn't cut the whole thing.

880
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:58,744
We were going down this rabbit hole of adding new stuff,

881
00:37:58,804 --> 00:37:59,425
changing stuff.

882
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:01,265
We didn't really see what was going on anymore.

883
00:38:01,305 --> 00:38:02,826
And at some point, our creative director came by

884
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:05,147
and he was like, guys, we should fix this.

885
00:38:05,447 --> 00:38:06,607
And so we sat down in a room.

886
00:38:07,307 --> 00:38:10,248
And we walked out of that room with a simple realization

887
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:11,949
that we had just put a slow motion there.

888
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,390
Because the slow motion does everything we want, right?

889
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:18,011
It gives the player time to think.

890
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:21,613
When they get seen, it doesn't really everything up.

891
00:38:22,543 --> 00:38:25,946
screw everything up completely so they can still think and react.

892
00:38:26,307 --> 00:38:31,251
But it also isn't making it so they feel like this was a sort of fail-safe,

893
00:38:31,432 --> 00:38:33,654
because there was a problem with the previous systems as well.

894
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:36,496
Players would, they were not bulletproof, right?

895
00:38:36,517 --> 00:38:38,178
There were situations where you would get seen and

896
00:38:38,198 --> 00:38:41,021
there was no space where you could teleport to safely.

897
00:38:41,301 --> 00:38:43,583
And if you put a system in your game that screams at the player,

898
00:38:43,623 --> 00:38:44,604
well, I'm going to save you.

899
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:48,227
but sometimes I don't, then that's not a good idea.

900
00:38:48,348 --> 00:38:49,629
And the slow motion doesn't do that.

901
00:38:49,649 --> 00:38:51,790
The slow motion just says, okay, you have some more time

902
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,632
before you get detected, so use that time.

903
00:38:54,573 --> 00:38:56,214
And it worked very well, I guess.

904
00:38:56,815 --> 00:38:58,176
So, back to the quick save.

905
00:38:59,354 --> 00:39:07,018
This was sort of the point where we realized that we should maybe embrace the idea that this is a game about quicksave and not try to obfuscate it.

906
00:39:07,098 --> 00:39:14,042
So we added things like the quicksave timer. This is a timer that pops up after one minute of gameplay and sort of screams at you and says like, one minute, right?

907
00:39:14,282 --> 00:39:21,266
We want you to save often. And screams at you and says, save the game! And after two minutes it gets orange and screams even louder and just gets...

908
00:39:21,387 --> 00:39:23,448
You can turn that off if stuff like that annoys you.

909
00:39:23,568 --> 00:39:26,489
But we could have done that a lot more...

910
00:39:27,496 --> 00:39:28,136
Hardcore, I think.

911
00:39:28,457 --> 00:39:29,898
Many people just don't see it anyway.

912
00:39:30,798 --> 00:39:32,500
But we did sort of stuff like this, right?

913
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,061
We went into that route of embracing the quicksave.

914
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,523
And if you play the tutorial of the game,

915
00:39:36,883 --> 00:39:39,605
you just walk around and there's some quicksave,

916
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:41,326
quicksave tutorials popping up all the way.

917
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:43,227
I think there are six in the first five minutes

918
00:39:43,267 --> 00:39:44,068
of the game or something.

919
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:45,549
Because we realized it's important.

920
00:39:46,029 --> 00:39:47,951
And the lesson that we learned from this was basically.

921
00:39:49,285 --> 00:39:52,025
If this is part of the core of your game, you just embrace it.

922
00:39:52,365 --> 00:39:55,566
Don't try to push it away, because this will always fail.

923
00:39:55,586 --> 00:39:57,766
You cannot remove it from the core of your game.

924
00:39:57,827 --> 00:39:58,587
It's the core.

925
00:39:59,047 --> 00:40:01,807
So embrace it, and then people will love it more,

926
00:40:01,887 --> 00:40:03,568
because you're being honest about what your game is.

927
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,468
And that quicksave reminder thing

928
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:08,949
got a lot of positive feedback from press and from players.

929
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:10,109
They were like, this is so cool.

930
00:40:10,169 --> 00:40:10,989
I've never seen this before.

931
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,270
And it's such a simple thing.

932
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,330
We only did it because we at some point

933
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,431
realized that this is our game, and we have to do that.

934
00:40:18,491 --> 00:40:18,611
So.

935
00:40:20,594 --> 00:40:25,816
I am going to, like, in the beginning I was thinking about showing you something or making

936
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:29,697
questions, but because I talked so fast, I can do both.

937
00:40:30,357 --> 00:40:31,618
So first, thank you.

938
00:40:40,661 --> 00:40:43,182
You can reach me through these channels to chat or whatever.

939
00:40:43,202 --> 00:40:47,883
I'm going to first show you something, and then if you have questions, we can do that.

940
00:40:48,645 --> 00:40:49,985
This is gonna take some loading time,

941
00:40:50,186 --> 00:40:51,546
but I hope it's worth it,

942
00:40:51,606 --> 00:40:55,348
because I brought the old prototypes of Shadow Tactics.

943
00:40:56,729 --> 00:40:58,290
So you're gonna see the moon.

944
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:04,173
No, no, no, this is gonna take a while,

945
00:41:04,213 --> 00:41:04,933
so I'm just gonna talk.

946
00:41:05,154 --> 00:41:07,735
So during development, we had three prototypes that,

947
00:41:08,876 --> 00:41:11,557
oh, that's wrong, three prototypes that we made

948
00:41:16,083 --> 00:41:18,125
that we sadly had to cut because, as I told you,

949
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,607
we couldn't barely finish the main game.

950
00:41:21,028 --> 00:41:22,729
Oh, by the way, the performance is gonna be horrible

951
00:41:22,769 --> 00:41:26,512
because my laptop isn't good, but it's not a problem.

952
00:41:26,572 --> 00:41:28,314
Yeah, we had to sadly cut those DLCs.

953
00:41:28,634 --> 00:41:31,416
This was the first idea that we had

954
00:41:31,476 --> 00:41:32,657
for how you should enter the game

955
00:41:32,697 --> 00:41:34,639
and everything would be on this map in a planning mode.

956
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,301
It's very ugly, of course, because this is alpha, right?

957
00:41:37,321 --> 00:41:38,602
This is our alpha milestone.

958
00:41:40,646 --> 00:41:44,671
Okay, let's see the moon. We had three DLCs, one of them was a ship DLC, whatever, then we had a

959
00:41:44,732 --> 00:41:49,097
story DLC which was pretty awesome. The idea was that the characters get together in a tavern

960
00:41:49,137 --> 00:41:53,643
and they drink and get drunk and they talk about stories of of missions they had and you sort of

961
00:41:53,684 --> 00:41:57,749
have it a little bit like Bastion where you get back in time and you play and they talk over it.

962
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:03,064
And the twist idea behind that was that Mugen is talking about the easiest mission he ever had.

963
00:42:03,905 --> 00:42:05,226
Where you play as Mugen all the time.

964
00:42:05,246 --> 00:42:06,788
Wow, beautiful UI, right?

965
00:42:07,448 --> 00:42:11,072
You play as Mugen all the time, but all the other characters sort of worked around him

966
00:42:11,512 --> 00:42:13,875
and cleared that up, and you get to play both of those.

967
00:42:14,916 --> 00:42:17,838
But this is the bigger DLC we had. It's the moon.

968
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:20,821
So the pitch behind the DLC was that...

969
00:42:20,841 --> 00:42:22,903
Let's see... Yeah, there we go.

970
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:28,558
that space shogun is trying to sort of carve his face into the moon so you can always see

971
00:42:28,598 --> 00:42:32,464
his face at night because he was very egocentric I guess.

972
00:42:33,325 --> 00:42:36,690
And our characters didn't like that so they decided to take a spaceship and kick his ass

973
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:37,130
basically.

974
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,254
The big, like, we wanted the DLC from a business standpoint

975
00:42:42,274 --> 00:42:44,436
to explain what the hell is going on here.

976
00:42:44,897 --> 00:42:46,619
And we wanted a DLC that could make press.

977
00:42:46,779 --> 00:42:48,321
Like, that was very crazy and where people were like,

978
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,964
oh, wow, like, if you release it a couple of months

979
00:42:51,044 --> 00:42:51,865
after the game, they were like,

980
00:42:51,946 --> 00:42:53,547
oh, I'm going to get back into Shadow Tactics.

981
00:42:53,588 --> 00:42:54,549
They have the moon, right?

982
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,811
That was sort of the idea behind it.

983
00:42:57,923 --> 00:43:00,305
And you can see it's very janky with the performance.

984
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:04,128
Then we had some ideas like what can you do in space?

985
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:07,411
We reversed gravity so you can only jump upwards

986
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,593
and have to take ladders to go down.

987
00:43:09,693 --> 00:43:10,634
This was very bad.

988
00:43:11,294 --> 00:43:14,177
We cut that from the, like we made two versions of this map

989
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:15,498
and we cut that in the second one

990
00:43:15,538 --> 00:43:16,779
because it just wasn't intuitive

991
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:18,020
and it felt completely stupid.

992
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,342
And then we have like drones flying around.

993
00:43:20,382 --> 00:43:21,963
You can see here making light.

994
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,224
So there was some cool stuff going on.

995
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:26,511
This is by the way, we had all the assets built for this,

996
00:43:26,611 --> 00:43:27,652
they just weren't textured.

997
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:30,315
There's a lot of game designer, level designer art in this.

998
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:33,859
So in the center we have this huge shield

999
00:43:33,899 --> 00:43:37,522
and there's this crane thing that they're using

1000
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:39,384
to sort of laser the face of the Shogun.

1001
00:43:39,945 --> 00:43:41,646
You're basically in one of his eyeballs.

1002
00:43:42,307 --> 00:43:43,768
This is the huge crater that you're in.

1003
00:43:46,055 --> 00:43:47,175
You could kill him in two ways.

1004
00:43:47,295 --> 00:43:49,216
Either you could kill him by sort of luring him

1005
00:43:49,496 --> 00:43:51,717
beneath this laser and killing him there,

1006
00:43:51,757 --> 00:43:54,378
or you could go over there and kill him using drop pods

1007
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:55,238
that you could call down,

1008
00:43:55,298 --> 00:43:57,599
and the alarm guards would come and drop pods.

1009
00:43:57,619 --> 00:43:59,080
There's a lot of cool stuff.

1010
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,181
You can see I'm a bit sad that we didn't get to do this.

1011
00:44:02,881 --> 00:44:05,162
Yeah, just wanted to show you that

1012
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:06,123
because I guess it's fun.

1013
00:44:07,203 --> 00:44:08,984
It never saw the day of light,

1014
00:44:09,044 --> 00:44:12,325
so maybe in the next game we'll do a moon DLC.

1015
00:44:13,497 --> 00:44:14,857
All right, thank you.

1016
00:44:14,877 --> 00:44:17,919
So if you have any questions, then you can ask me.

1017
00:44:25,203 --> 00:44:26,043
Hi, thanks.

1018
00:44:26,284 --> 00:44:26,804
Great talk.

1019
00:44:26,824 --> 00:44:27,604
I love the game.

1020
00:44:28,205 --> 00:44:30,486
So sort of a bonus question first.

1021
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,607
As a big fan of the genre, are we

1022
00:44:33,648 --> 00:44:36,209
going to see a sequel maybe in a different setting,

1023
00:44:36,249 --> 00:44:38,430
like World War something?

1024
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:49,913
But the main question is sadly about the business part a little bit, as a gamer who was waiting for the revival of the genre.

1025
00:44:50,653 --> 00:44:57,359
Because it seemed to me, I was aware of the game since its announcement, because I was hoping for it.

1026
00:44:58,139 --> 00:45:03,405
It seemed like initially the game got very little visibility, maybe from the publisher as well,

1027
00:45:03,845 --> 00:45:09,111
and sort of after a while became this cult hit that people knew was very good,

1028
00:45:09,131 --> 00:45:13,835
that it started selling, that's what at least the Steam Spy data seemed to suggest.

1029
00:45:14,096 --> 00:45:17,539
The community kind of exploded, people started talking about it,

1030
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,583
so if you can share anything about that part, that would be interesting.

1031
00:45:21,864 --> 00:45:26,868
Sure. So regarding the first part, we actually, it's a small anecdote but we have time,

1032
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:33,233
we went to Barcelona to visit Pyro, or at least Gonzo, who was sort of the director of the first

1033
00:45:33,253 --> 00:45:37,437
Commandos games, and he played Shadow Tactics and he loved it very much and that was very important

1034
00:45:37,457 --> 00:45:41,500
to us and we were very happy about it. But the Commandos IP is a very difficult IP to get,

1035
00:45:41,721 --> 00:45:48,426
so that is most likely not going to happen. And regarding the second question, so yeah,

1036
00:45:50,193 --> 00:45:51,996
We don't really, we're not good at marketing,

1037
00:45:52,036 --> 00:45:54,140
and marketing is hard, and you need a lot of money

1038
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,943
or clever ideas, I guess, to do that.

1039
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,886
And we knew that the game was very good,

1040
00:45:58,247 --> 00:46:01,212
and for some reason it didn't get traction very much.

1041
00:46:01,272 --> 00:46:03,316
We had a very early trailer, but it wasn't very good.

1042
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,231
So that didn't do much.

1043
00:46:05,271 --> 00:46:07,391
And I think the biggest marketing asset that we

1044
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,472
actually had was the demo.

1045
00:46:08,692 --> 00:46:10,292
Like we said, there's a free demo of the game.

1046
00:46:10,592 --> 00:46:12,553
And we released that one or two weeks before the game.

1047
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,573
And that's when it sort of started to kick in.

1048
00:46:14,633 --> 00:46:17,534
But then it's a game that takes a while to play, takes a

1049
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:18,234
while to get into.

1050
00:46:18,294 --> 00:46:20,815
So press would also, they didn't really release reviews

1051
00:46:20,915 --> 00:46:23,095
on the first day because we didn't send it to them early

1052
00:46:23,135 --> 00:46:23,656
enough, I guess.

1053
00:46:24,116 --> 00:46:26,536
Plus, there was things like The Last Guardian coming out

1054
00:46:26,596 --> 00:46:28,777
that some people might have been waiting for, or Final

1055
00:46:28,817 --> 00:46:29,577
Fantasy XV.

1056
00:46:30,617 --> 00:46:31,138
Small games.

1057
00:46:32,058 --> 00:46:32,298
They don't.

1058
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:34,706
directly fight with our game, but still.

1059
00:46:35,486 --> 00:46:37,667
And so I guess that word to mouth was basically

1060
00:46:37,707 --> 00:46:38,787
the main thing that helped us then.

1061
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:40,988
The game was good and then people talked about it.

1062
00:46:41,268 --> 00:46:42,549
You could always tell your friend that,

1063
00:46:42,589 --> 00:46:43,649
hey, there's a free demo, right?

1064
00:46:43,709 --> 00:46:45,690
You just, you don't have to buy it just because I tell you.

1065
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,451
You can always get the demo and you can start playing.

1066
00:46:47,991 --> 00:46:50,872
And I think this is the biggest, best thing we did

1067
00:46:50,912 --> 00:46:53,213
for marketing that probably helped elevate the game

1068
00:46:53,674 --> 00:46:54,974
in the second and in the long run,

1069
00:46:55,134 --> 00:46:56,775
because they could just play it and you can try it.

1070
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:59,236
One tip regarding demos.

1071
00:46:59,336 --> 00:47:00,376
If you're doing a demo for PS4,

1072
00:47:02,213 --> 00:47:04,094
be sure that it's a demo and not a trial.

1073
00:47:04,274 --> 00:47:06,434
They have this weird thing where if you make your game

1074
00:47:06,474 --> 00:47:08,775
and you can basically upgrade the game to the full version,

1075
00:47:08,835 --> 00:47:09,916
which we thought was pretty cool,

1076
00:47:09,936 --> 00:47:11,496
then you don't have to download it again or whatever.

1077
00:47:11,837 --> 00:47:15,058
It's a trial and it will not be visible in the demo section.

1078
00:47:15,398 --> 00:47:16,979
It will actually not be visible anywhere.

1079
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:19,279
So don't do that.

1080
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:23,221
Make it a demo, which might suck, but yeah.

1081
00:47:24,121 --> 00:47:24,281
Thanks.

1082
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:36,803
So I lived in Japan for over 15 years and because of that I tend to be a little bit allergic to things, media, that portrays Japan from in the West, right?

1083
00:47:37,984 --> 00:47:44,468
And I've been really impressed with the game including like the voiceovers and all that and so I'm wondering how is it you got it so right?

1084
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:48,010
I mean do you have somebody from Japan on the team or how did you do that?

1085
00:47:48,295 --> 00:47:49,916
Yeah, that was a big, big process.

1086
00:47:49,936 --> 00:47:51,756
We did not have anyone from Japan on the team,

1087
00:47:51,856 --> 00:47:54,717
but we had someone who studies Japanese culture from Munich.

1088
00:47:54,737 --> 00:47:56,418
We had him come over and check out the game

1089
00:47:56,958 --> 00:47:59,319
and give us mostly feedback on stuff

1090
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:04,220
like the way they talk to each other or visual stuff,

1091
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,561
like how much stone did they use

1092
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:06,501
when they built their houses.

1093
00:48:06,541 --> 00:48:07,821
And we did a lot of research into that.

1094
00:48:08,062 --> 00:48:10,682
And it's not that easy because like it's way back

1095
00:48:10,742 --> 00:48:11,743
and then it's also Japan.

1096
00:48:11,783 --> 00:48:13,003
So you don't find as much here,

1097
00:48:13,643 --> 00:48:15,044
but we try to do a lot there.

1098
00:48:15,304 --> 00:48:15,884
One of the biggest.

1099
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:20,641
topics of discussion we had for a long, long time was if wagons had two or four wheels

1100
00:48:20,962 --> 00:48:23,346
back then and how that was an ongoing thing.

1101
00:48:26,048 --> 00:48:28,490
Yeah, this is the level of detail you get down to at some point.

1102
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:33,494
Yeah, it was tough and I'm glad that you say that we did it well,

1103
00:48:33,534 --> 00:48:34,514
because you never really know.

1104
00:48:34,935 --> 00:48:38,818
Because if you ask a Japanese person, they will tell you yes, but maybe not.

1105
00:48:39,558 --> 00:48:40,479
Because they're very polite.

1106
00:48:40,899 --> 00:48:44,102
And we are actually releasing it in Japan as well now,

1107
00:48:44,122 --> 00:48:47,804
so we're hoping to get some more feedback there regarding that topic.

1108
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:57,746
So, great game, I think I'll finish it one day since it's pretty big, but hypothetically,

1109
00:48:57,926 --> 00:49:05,492
if you were to do a sequel, how would you handle the number of characters?

1110
00:49:05,592 --> 00:49:10,756
Because right now it seems that the number of characters is quite good for the challenges

1111
00:49:10,796 --> 00:49:16,221
that you have, and it seems that if you added new characters, you would have to add specific

1112
00:49:16,281 --> 00:49:19,563
challenges just for that new character to the formula.

1113
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:19,763
So...

1114
00:49:20,928 --> 00:49:24,271
In what way would you look into expanding the features of the game,

1115
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:28,334
like where it would be environment, enemy focused, or actually character focused?

1116
00:49:29,055 --> 00:49:32,178
So, we like the number of five characters,

1117
00:49:32,498 --> 00:49:35,380
so we will be sticking to five characters for our next game as well.

1118
00:49:36,781 --> 00:49:39,584
We are actually developing a game that is like Shadow Tactics right now,

1119
00:49:39,664 --> 00:49:44,948
so this is not a secret yet, but it's not Shadow Tactics 2 though.

1120
00:49:47,622 --> 00:49:52,464
It is a very difficult topic for us to see how we want to change the thing up and how we want to keep it that way

1121
00:49:52,524 --> 00:49:55,065
because we don't want to take away too much from what made the game great.

1122
00:49:55,445 --> 00:49:59,447
We also don't want it to feel like a simple copy-paste thing, and that is very hard to do.

1123
00:49:59,927 --> 00:50:05,870
So our current approach is that we have characters that are similar to the Shadow Tactics characters

1124
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:09,552
and we have characters that are completely new, but it's still five characters.

1125
00:50:09,592 --> 00:50:12,513
So we had to take some of the stuff out that we had in Shadow Tactics.

1126
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:17,176
We also try to do stuff with the environment, as you said.

1127
00:50:17,256 --> 00:50:19,758
This is, I can't really talk about the feature yet,

1128
00:50:19,778 --> 00:50:20,438
but it's pretty cool.

1129
00:50:20,939 --> 00:50:22,780
It's about how you navigate environment

1130
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:26,022
and make the maps feel more real, like real places.

1131
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:28,584
This was a big thing that we're trying to focus on

1132
00:50:28,804 --> 00:50:29,385
in the next one.

1133
00:50:30,786 --> 00:50:31,286
Hope it works.

1134
00:50:32,527 --> 00:50:32,747
Yeah.

1135
00:50:33,808 --> 00:50:34,208
Anyone else?

1136
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:36,670
Yes.

1137
00:50:40,893 --> 00:50:41,734
Awesome talk, thanks.

1138
00:50:42,074 --> 00:50:42,294
Thanks.

1139
00:50:42,554 --> 00:50:43,335
Oh, that sounded weird.

1140
00:50:44,797 --> 00:50:46,098
I have two questions if that's cool.

1141
00:50:47,318 --> 00:50:50,600
One, so swimming seems extremely powerful.

1142
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,280
Like, what are the sort of conversations

1143
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,861
that led to it being that way?

1144
00:50:54,681 --> 00:50:57,142
Well, we had in the beginning, we had systems

1145
00:50:57,182 --> 00:50:58,263
where you could hold your breath

1146
00:50:58,383 --> 00:50:59,663
only for a certain amount of time.

1147
00:51:00,003 --> 00:51:02,764
And then we realized that this was very complicated

1148
00:51:02,804 --> 00:51:04,905
and weird because we had to make behavior

1149
00:51:04,945 --> 00:51:06,426
for the guards shooting into the water

1150
00:51:06,546 --> 00:51:08,247
and what they would do if they see you in the water

1151
00:51:08,287 --> 00:51:09,727
because they can't really react to that.

1152
00:51:10,222 --> 00:51:12,683
And then we decided, well, we just use the small things,

1153
00:51:13,043 --> 00:51:17,225
the straw things to bamboo for the ninjas

1154
00:51:17,245 --> 00:51:17,945
to breathe underwater.

1155
00:51:17,965 --> 00:51:21,107
It's very ninja and very cool, and just have infinite thing.

1156
00:51:21,147 --> 00:51:23,448
And the water is powerful, but we

1157
00:51:23,548 --> 00:51:25,169
try to use it clever and level design.

1158
00:51:25,229 --> 00:51:27,510
So we know that you can always get away through the water,

1159
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:29,130
but it's balanced in a way that you will usually

1160
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,251
take one hit from a guard before you get into the water.

1161
00:51:31,591 --> 00:51:33,652
So this was sort of a way of balancing that.

1162
00:51:36,054 --> 00:51:37,714
And secondly, what were the triggers

1163
00:51:38,977 --> 00:51:40,237
determine when the music changes?

1164
00:51:43,118 --> 00:51:47,559
Well, it's just rather simple environment triggers that we place in the environment

1165
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:52,361
or level events when we say, okay, you have killed two of the four guards you have to

1166
00:51:52,381 --> 00:51:54,421
kill and we are adding new layers to the system.

1167
00:51:54,722 --> 00:51:57,342
We actually have some pretty cool audio stuff going on in the game.

1168
00:51:57,562 --> 00:52:01,524
For example, if you perform an action, like the tracks are very basic, but if you perform

1169
00:52:01,544 --> 00:52:04,665
an action with one of the characters, each of them has an instrument attached to them.

1170
00:52:05,076 --> 00:52:06,537
And if you sort of do something with Moogan,

1171
00:52:06,557 --> 00:52:09,038
you will have these Kodo drums playing something.

1172
00:52:09,779 --> 00:52:11,760
Whatever it is, if you do something with Hayato,

1173
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,760
I don't know what his instrument is.

1174
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,261
Yuki is a flute, obviously.

1175
00:52:14,361 --> 00:52:17,363
So you sort of, nobody realizes that it's in the game,

1176
00:52:17,403 --> 00:52:18,683
but you're sort of building the soundtrack

1177
00:52:18,703 --> 00:52:21,565
by playing the game through these stingers that we have.

1178
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:24,687
And yeah, the audio guy, Philippu,

1179
00:52:24,707 --> 00:52:26,128
he's, shout out to Philippu, he's great.

1180
00:52:26,328 --> 00:52:27,548
