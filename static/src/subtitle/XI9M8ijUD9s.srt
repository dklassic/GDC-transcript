1
00:00:06,544 --> 00:00:08,926
Thank you for coming to my talk.

2
00:00:10,188 --> 00:00:10,728
I appreciate it.

3
00:00:10,748 --> 00:00:14,092
It's a really nice day, and there's a happy hour going on the Expo, although I should

4
00:00:14,112 --> 00:00:15,314
probably not tell you that, I guess.

5
00:00:16,195 --> 00:00:16,976
But thanks for coming.

6
00:00:18,938 --> 00:00:23,083
So my name is Oliver Franzke, and I'm the lead programmer of Broken Age.

7
00:00:23,403 --> 00:00:25,986
And so today, this talk is a little bit...

8
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:28,687
of a weird talk for me personally,

9
00:00:29,408 --> 00:00:30,428
because as a programmer,

10
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:33,009
you know, I like to talk about technical things.

11
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:35,790
And in fact, the last couple of GDCs,

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,791
I talked about various issues

13
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,632
or challenges that we were facing when making Broken Age

14
00:00:41,372 --> 00:00:43,193
and how we approach those.

15
00:00:44,553 --> 00:01:05,189
But today I'm going to talk about something completely on technical but attack a topic that I think it's really important and that in many ways is you know underserved and it's a bit of a mystery around it, but it's such an important topic that can really you know make a break a game of any size and that is the topic of leadership.

16
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:12,254
And specifically I want to talk about kind of this point in your career.

17
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:16,456
when you're promoted into a role with leadership responsibilities or

18
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:20,458
in other ways, maybe in college or whatever, you get, you know, all of a sudden

19
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,580
have responsibility for a group of people, not just yourself anymore.

20
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:30,543
Because this is, you know, very different or like a very interesting time

21
00:01:30,603 --> 00:01:34,104
when a lot of things kind of change in your kind of day-to-day job,

22
00:01:34,544 --> 00:01:38,766
but that isn't talked about all that often, but it's, you know, such an important

23
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:39,967
topic that...

24
00:01:40,407 --> 00:01:42,528
I want to share a little bit of my experience

25
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,650
and what I've learned over the years.

26
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:48,352
And before I'm going to start talking

27
00:01:48,372 --> 00:01:50,413
about very specific things, I would

28
00:01:50,453 --> 00:01:51,534
like to get you guys' help.

29
00:01:51,934 --> 00:01:53,775
Just three really short questions.

30
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:55,776
After that, I promise you can sit back and relax.

31
00:01:55,796 --> 00:01:56,857
You don't need to do anything else.

32
00:01:57,838 --> 00:02:00,799
I realize this is the last session, so it's been a long

33
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:00,959
day.

34
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,904
First of all, I would be really curious who here in the audience had at any point in your

35
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:07,826
career any kind of like leadership experience.

36
00:02:08,606 --> 00:02:09,767
Please raise your hand if that's the case.

37
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:11,109
Wow, awesome.

38
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:13,431
Wow, that's a lot of people.

39
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:19,096
Now to narrow down this question a little bit more, I would be curious who is kind of

40
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:20,357
new to this role right now.

41
00:02:20,437 --> 00:02:23,019
So if you've been promoted in the last year perhaps, please raise your hand.

42
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:25,323
I am OK, awesome.

43
00:02:26,184 --> 00:02:30,427
And then the last question is so for all of you

44
00:02:30,768 --> 00:02:32,950
who just raised their hand in the first question.

45
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,792
So you have any kind of your experience in the past.

46
00:02:36,753 --> 00:02:39,376
I would be curious who received any kind of preparation

47
00:02:39,396 --> 00:02:39,876
for this role.

48
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,958
Did your company sent you to a course,

49
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:43,720
gave you some books, or like in any way

50
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,640
prepared you for this role.

51
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,082
So please raise your hand if that's the case.

52
00:02:47,163 --> 00:02:47,503
Oh, well.

53
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:48,524
OK.

54
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:48,584
OK.

55
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:53,772
That's actually good. That's more than what I've seen in the past.

56
00:02:53,972 --> 00:02:56,553
And so what I just saw is like, there were a lot of people,

57
00:02:56,973 --> 00:02:59,334
you know, maybe even like half or 60% of the room,

58
00:02:59,774 --> 00:03:04,275
you know, were responsible for other people at some point.

59
00:03:05,196 --> 00:03:07,016
But when it came to the question of like, you know,

60
00:03:07,056 --> 00:03:08,557
where you actually prepared for this role,

61
00:03:08,637 --> 00:03:09,897
not all that many hands.

62
00:03:11,038 --> 00:03:15,682
went up and that is in many ways off the talking to many leads that seems to be

63
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:19,685
pretty standard practice in the games industry and I find it really baffling

64
00:03:19,765 --> 00:03:24,069
because in a way as a lead to get kind of you know pushed into this role and

65
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:28,092
you kind of left you know to your own device to figure out how you supposed to

66
00:03:28,152 --> 00:03:32,416
now you know change the day-to-day job and kind of you know how you supposed to

67
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:36,499
deal with this and considering how important as well as I'm always kind of

68
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:37,180
baffled by that.

69
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,983
Now the first thing really to realize when it comes to leadership is that as a team lead,

70
00:03:45,283 --> 00:03:50,286
you know, leadership requires a whole different additional set of skills that you have to learn.

71
00:03:50,806 --> 00:03:56,548
And these are skills that, you know, you kind of add it to your list of skills that you had previously as an individual contributor.

72
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:57,189
So if you've been...

73
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:01,473
you know programmer and out as the design on you obviously you know have

74
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:06,139
been doing really good work at your at your company and you know somebody

75
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,305
in trust you now to bring that good work to and you know be responsible for

76
00:04:11,345 --> 00:04:15,691
entire group of people. But this additional set of skills and nobody ever

77
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:16,311
tells you about.

78
00:04:16,772 --> 00:04:19,354
That is really important and that's kind of what I want to talk about today.

79
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:24,459
And it might help you to know that most leads really struggle with this adjustment.

80
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,364
This is not an easy thing to do and it's not something that just kind of happens naturally.

81
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:34,449
And most people I talk to really said, you know, it took me a long time to kind of learn

82
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:37,752
this skill and that skill and to really kind of get used to.

83
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,396
get used to this, but I really thought for the longest time

84
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:46,479
myself that you really have to be born to be a good team lead,

85
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:48,101
like you know, you can't learn this,

86
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,222
but I don't think that's true.

87
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,684
I think this is just really a set of skills,

88
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:55,967
and you can learn this, and you can become an effective lead.

89
00:04:56,448 --> 00:04:57,989
And if you're in this position, you

90
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:00,791
should really consider spending some extra cycles

91
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:03,593
to learn about this.

92
00:05:04,314 --> 00:05:06,055
Now, before I'm going to start.

93
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:10,337
talking about a very specific things and responsibilities and techniques and so

94
00:05:10,437 --> 00:05:16,219
on. I want to very briefly sure share with you my own kind of leadership

95
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,681
story and the reason why I'm doing that is because in my mind leadership is a

96
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:25,862
very personal skill since it is a soft soft skill and everyone kind of

97
00:05:25,882 --> 00:05:29,624
approaches that in a different way and you know certainly for me every

98
00:05:29,644 --> 00:05:33,185
supervisor ever had was very different and you know approached this role in a

99
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:33,885
very unique way.

100
00:05:34,445 --> 00:05:36,607
So I want to give you a little bit of context for you know

101
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,828
what I'm going to talk about later on.

102
00:05:39,128 --> 00:05:42,250
So my personal leadership story in the games industry

103
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,533
began when just shortly after I joined Double Fine Productions

104
00:05:45,673 --> 00:05:46,693
here in San Francisco.

105
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:50,035
At the time, we were making a 360 connect game

106
00:05:50,456 --> 00:05:52,717
in collaboration with Sesame Street called Once Upon a

107
00:05:52,737 --> 00:05:53,137
Monster.

108
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,520
And the project lead for this project asked me, hey,

109
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,802
do you want to delete engine program on this game?

110
00:06:01,783 --> 00:06:02,663
And I was really excited.

111
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:05,264
You know, this was an awesome, an awesome moment

112
00:06:05,304 --> 00:06:06,084
for the longest time.

113
00:06:06,144 --> 00:06:07,784
And my kind of career objectives,

114
00:06:07,844 --> 00:06:09,465
I had the sentence like, hey, you know,

115
00:06:09,545 --> 00:06:11,385
I want to be a lead programmer.

116
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:12,845
Or like, you want to be responsible for a group

117
00:06:12,865 --> 00:06:13,445
of programmers.

118
00:06:14,226 --> 00:06:15,426
So I said, yes, awesome.

119
00:06:15,546 --> 00:06:16,646
I want to do this.

120
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:17,346
Fantastic.

121
00:06:18,327 --> 00:06:19,487
And I accepted the job.

122
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:21,227
You know, came to the office on Monday.

123
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:23,128
The following Monday, sat down in front of my computer.

124
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:27,789
And I didn't really know how my day-to-day job was

125
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:28,989
kind of supposed to change.

126
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:35,054
And in fact, while I was going through my old photos the other day, I found a picture of myself from just about that time.

127
00:06:38,588 --> 00:06:41,811
look at guys all excited. You know that now is

128
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:45,153
responsible people or dogs, I guess, but he has no

129
00:06:45,193 --> 00:06:47,254
clue and must be the old to because I

130
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:49,876
just now realize that this video cell phone in a

131
00:06:49,896 --> 00:06:51,677
picture, you know, it's a old school dog, I guess

132
00:06:52,718 --> 00:06:55,339
but joke aside, you know, I really I think I

133
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:57,661
feel he felt lost in the beginning and I think

134
00:06:57,721 --> 00:07:00,323
my reaction to this which you know I hope

135
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:02,764
this is normal human reaction is that in times of

136
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:06,106
uncertainty, you just kind of continue doing what you know

137
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:08,328
right, you just kind of continue doing that and.

138
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,213
So I kept my head down I did a lot of programming and I think

139
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:15,256
you know we shipped this game of you know, I'm pretty proud of

140
00:07:15,316 --> 00:07:15,396
it.

141
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:19,679
After the budget was over and I had some time to kind of think

142
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:23,823
about about my role as the lead on the specific project I

143
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:27,986
realized that I really didn't do anything in this regard in this

144
00:07:28,046 --> 00:07:30,868
kind of leadership aspect and if I ever want to accept the role

145
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,390
again and just forgot I really should spend some more time

146
00:07:33,671 --> 00:07:36,793
learning about learning about this and to be more effective.

147
00:07:37,886 --> 00:07:40,829
And the first thing I did after kind of coming to this conclusion

148
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:44,472
is to think about supervisors I had in the past.

149
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:48,436
And I noticed, you know, obviously there were some of my bosses I really liked,

150
00:07:48,817 --> 00:07:51,719
and I thought they were doing a fantastic job leading a group of programmers.

151
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,682
But then there also were a few people I didn't really like,

152
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:58,906
and I thought, you know, they really should not be in charge of a group of people.

153
00:07:59,763 --> 00:08:02,084
Now, I wanted to break this down a little bit more.

154
00:08:02,124 --> 00:08:04,345
And so I started to write down some of the similarities

155
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:05,966
in these groups.

156
00:08:06,646 --> 00:08:10,108
And what I noticed is that for the supervisor I really liked,

157
00:08:10,268 --> 00:08:12,469
generally, team morale was really high.

158
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:15,490
People were motivated to work on the tasks

159
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,751
that they were assigned to them.

160
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,825
Generally it the direction that he was going and the entire

161
00:08:23,846 --> 00:08:26,266
project was going was clear and even if there were changes.

162
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:30,147
They were communicated well ahead of time and in in in the

163
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:33,348
good way and for me personally and probably most importantly

164
00:08:33,528 --> 00:08:37,369
as an individual contributor I was felt that my work mattered

165
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:41,330
and that it was valued and important to my supervisor and

166
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:45,090
because of that you know it fell I felt motivated to give

167
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,111
this extra bit of like creativity and energy to make

168
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:49,931
this project awesome.

169
00:08:50,712 --> 00:08:55,114
Now, on the other hand, in times where I didn't really like my supervisor too much, I realized

170
00:08:55,154 --> 00:08:56,915
generally team morale was pretty low.

171
00:08:56,935 --> 00:09:02,498
There was a lot of complaining going on, gossiping, like company politics happening, direction

172
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:06,419
wasn't clear, and even if, you know, there was some kind of goal that would change frequently,

173
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:10,201
so you know, there was not a very predictable working environment.

174
00:09:11,222 --> 00:09:13,563
Maybe some of you kind of recognize some of these symptoms.

175
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:20,636
Most importantly for myself, though, I felt that my own work didn't really matter.

176
00:09:20,656 --> 00:09:26,778
I didn't really feel that my supervisor thought that what I was doing at the time was really important and mattered anyway.

177
00:09:26,838 --> 00:09:31,239
So, you know, why should I be excited about it and spend an extra amount of energy on it?

178
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:34,700
So usually I just wanted to get this project over with to move on to something else.

179
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:38,685
Now obviously, you know, we want to figure out how to be like this guy, right?

180
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:43,352
Like, how can you be this person who hopefully, you know, motivates the team and makes sure

181
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:45,655
that everybody, you know, feels empowered.

182
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:49,667
So this is what I want to talk about today.

183
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:52,448
So if you're new to this role of leadership,

184
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:55,289
hopefully I can give you a few things

185
00:09:55,349 --> 00:09:58,130
that will help yourself to,

186
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,010
because practically it's how to kind of get used to this role.

187
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:02,231
You know, if you've been,

188
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:05,252
if you're like a senior manager and you've been in charge,

189
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:07,813
or you are in charge of other people who are leading people.

190
00:10:08,553 --> 00:10:13,075
Maybe this will help you to re-familiarize yourself with the situation that, you know, this is not a natural thing to do.

191
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:20,377
This is not easy for most people and, you know, maybe there's something you can do to help other leads in your company.

192
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:26,755
But why is leadership kind of even important in the games industry?

193
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:28,357
And that's not a bad question.

194
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,619
It's actually a pretty good question, because

195
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,143
if you're working for a standard games company, chances are

196
00:10:33,703 --> 00:10:38,048
your hierarchy in terms of like organizational structure is not very deep.

197
00:10:38,128 --> 00:10:40,150
You probably have like a department lead,

198
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:43,955
and then chances are it's already like project leaders, like the CEO.

199
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:47,637
Now this combined with the fact that you're surrounded by people

200
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:49,498
who are probably a very similar interest in you,

201
00:10:49,878 --> 00:10:51,239
and in many ways are probably going

202
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,380
to have a similar age than you, leads

203
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,681
to this kind of environment where

204
00:10:56,141 --> 00:10:57,562
it feels like kind of like in college,

205
00:10:57,582 --> 00:10:59,883
you're just making a game with a bunch of buddies.

206
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:00,844
And this is great.

207
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:03,025
I don't want to put this in any kind of negative light

208
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:05,426
because this fun, creative environment is really

209
00:11:05,446 --> 00:11:08,487
why I personally stayed in the industry for such a long time.

210
00:11:09,488 --> 00:11:14,131
On the other hand, I think these days while projects are getting bigger and you know,

211
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:20,955
cost more money, it is important to realize that, you know, it is an industry and you

212
00:11:20,975 --> 00:11:23,977
know, now that we, you know, projects have become so big, there are different divisions

213
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:29,760
and different departments and then subgroups in there, it's become infeasible, became infeasible

214
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:35,243
for everyone in the company to know everyone else and to effectively communicate with everyone

215
00:11:35,304 --> 00:11:37,685
else to make this project a success.

216
00:11:38,784 --> 00:11:41,347
And this is why where your role as a lead

217
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:44,670
is just incredibly crucial because this kind

218
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,873
of interdisciplinary cooperation and coordination

219
00:11:48,393 --> 00:11:51,036
is what will make or break potentially the game.

220
00:11:51,516 --> 00:11:55,080
So I guess what I want to say is if your title, your job title

221
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,083
includes the word lead, I encourage you to just really

222
00:11:58,123 --> 00:12:00,545
take the serious because your contributions are really,

223
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:01,246
really important.

224
00:12:01,306 --> 00:12:02,907
And sometimes it can feel like.

225
00:12:03,408 --> 00:12:07,772
you know, only your kind of programming or art or design tasks really matter,

226
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:08,493
but that's not true.

227
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:11,736
The leadership aspect is really, really important.

228
00:12:12,436 --> 00:12:14,758
Now, what are some of these responsibilities

229
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:16,980
that I talked about earlier?

230
00:12:17,601 --> 00:12:20,364
Now, I think personally, first and foremost,

231
00:12:21,004 --> 00:12:22,666
as a lead, you should really work very hard

232
00:12:22,706 --> 00:12:24,367
on establishing an environment of trust.

233
00:12:25,422 --> 00:12:41,762
And this is important because now that you've been kind of you've been promoted into this role and you kind of left this group of peers, you actually have to work hard on to make sure that you know you can communicate professionally and that you're approachable and that you're trustworthy.

234
00:12:42,443 --> 00:12:46,724
Because you know people might come to you with sensitive information and in

235
00:12:46,804 --> 00:12:50,106
how can someone you know talk to you about something that's going wrong if

236
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:53,867
you're known as someone who gossips that's not a good environment to be in

237
00:12:54,047 --> 00:12:58,188
or you know if if someone on your team notices some kind of issue that will

238
00:12:58,228 --> 00:13:03,290
potentially put the next sprint at risk of you know have even further reaching

239
00:13:04,491 --> 00:13:08,252
implications if you known as someone who generally is not really approachable.

240
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:11,514
or generally doesn't take bad news well

241
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:13,455
chances are you're not going to hear about it

242
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:15,857
because the person is either going to step around you

243
00:13:15,897 --> 00:13:16,777
talk to somebody else

244
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:19,279
or maybe not even say anything at all

245
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:21,400
and then just wait for the train wreck to happen

246
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,742
that is not a good thing, you don't want to be there

247
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:28,365
but getting to this environment where

248
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:31,006
you can trust your team and the team can trust you

249
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:33,088
is not automatic, you need to work on this

250
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,569
and this is something that's important

251
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:37,030
and I'm going to talk more about it later on

252
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,151
how to get there

253
00:13:38,897 --> 00:13:43,920
Now, of course, also, now that you're responsible for an entire group of people and their work,

254
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:48,043
that means you're not just responsible for your own kind of tasks anymore.

255
00:13:49,344 --> 00:13:52,285
And that means you should also work on kind of setting a direction for your team.

256
00:13:52,505 --> 00:13:54,507
And ideally this should...

257
00:13:56,085 --> 00:14:00,291
end up in a kind of near term a long term kind of plan.

258
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:04,676
So near term maybe like you know months or 2 down the road. Long

259
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:07,700
term plan perhaps you know 6 months on the road or and of

260
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,200
the project.

261
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:10,203
And this should.

262
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:13,664
ideally end up in kind of a vacant size mission statement,

263
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:15,505
you know, let's assume for second year

264
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:18,726
responsible for a group of that tools for them is

265
00:14:19,346 --> 00:14:21,527
you could imagine you know a good business statement would be

266
00:14:21,547 --> 00:14:25,188
as a tool steam we want to make sure that every content update

267
00:14:25,228 --> 00:14:27,909
that gets made by a con equator is reflected in the game

268
00:14:27,969 --> 00:14:29,490
engine within 10 seconds.

269
00:14:30,633 --> 00:14:34,115
This is great. Everybody can understand this. It's very clear. It's short.

270
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,477
And it's challenging. It should be challenging.

271
00:14:39,137 --> 00:14:40,218
So this is great.

272
00:14:40,678 --> 00:14:42,759
Now, this is not just a thought experiment for yourself.

273
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,240
It's not just so you can write it down on a piece of paper.

274
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,883
You know ideally you know you make sure to communicate this to you to your team

275
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:54,166
as well because day-to-day decision-making process you can be

276
00:14:54,206 --> 00:14:58,429
influenced by where you want to be in in a year. You know as a programmer you may

277
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:02,311
notice if you start writing a very complicated system that will be in you

278
00:15:02,351 --> 00:15:02,892
know games

279
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:05,893
for the next 5, 10 years.

280
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:10,874
It will make a huge difference to your decision-making process

281
00:15:11,294 --> 00:15:13,435
if you know that some feature or some constraints

282
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:15,895
will be important later on.

283
00:15:17,356 --> 00:15:20,156
And then lastly, I think the most important responsibility

284
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:22,417
really is to support your team.

285
00:15:23,582 --> 00:15:26,123
And I think I got this totally wrong in the beginning

286
00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:27,823
because when I thought about like leadership,

287
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:30,424
I always thought about this kind of traditional image

288
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:32,845
like of a pyramid, you have to kind of delete on top

289
00:15:32,885 --> 00:15:34,686
and then kind of, you know, more and more people on the knees

290
00:15:34,746 --> 00:15:36,466
and work distribution kind of triples down

291
00:15:36,506 --> 00:15:37,306
and stuff gets done.

292
00:15:38,407 --> 00:15:40,588
And this works well if you're in an environment

293
00:15:40,628 --> 00:15:43,048
where you have, you know, where authoritative leadership style

294
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:44,169
is important like the army,

295
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,189
but I don't think this works very well

296
00:15:46,229 --> 00:15:48,210
in the games industry in this kind of creative environment.

297
00:15:49,111 --> 00:15:54,835
In a way, you're there to make sure that your team can be successful to achieve the goals that you set.

298
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:58,818
So it's almost like a flip pyramid, where you're there to kind of hold up your team to make sure

299
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:01,541
that they can get there, that they have everything they need.

300
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:05,524
And this can be as simple as making sure that they have software and hardware they need,

301
00:16:05,744 --> 00:16:11,669
or to talk with someone on your team about a certain task and how to approach it,

302
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:18,014
or if somebody struggles with work performance, that's also your responsibility to help this person.

303
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:22,629
Now, some of you may ask yourself this question now,

304
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,058
but what about my actual job?

305
00:16:26,644 --> 00:16:28,184
And this is the question I heard a lot

306
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:31,045
when I started to talk to other leads about this.

307
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:32,946
Like, after I realized I should learn about it

308
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:34,546
and I started to write down a little bit of some

309
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:37,547
of my experiences, I kind of talked to a lot of other people

310
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:38,747
to kind of get their view.

311
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,448
And what I heard very often was a story like,

312
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:42,928
you know, I really like being a lead.

313
00:16:42,948 --> 00:16:45,489
I like to be involved in some of the kind of more project-wide

314
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:46,509
decision-making process.

315
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:50,110
But with all of these meetings and talking to people

316
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,270
and all of that stuff, writing reviews,

317
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,671
I really don't know when I'm supposed to do my actual job.

318
00:16:56,503 --> 00:16:59,985
And this is, I think, probably the biggest misconception

319
00:17:00,025 --> 00:17:01,005
when it comes to leadership.

320
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:05,707
Because as a team lead, leadership is your actual job.

321
00:17:06,507 --> 00:17:07,888
Now, this is really important to me.

322
00:17:08,648 --> 00:17:10,529
So if there's only one thing you take away from this talk,

323
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,409
I really hope it's this.

324
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:14,131
As a team lead, leadership is your actual job.

325
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:17,252
All of these meetings, writing reviews, talking to people,

326
00:17:17,332 --> 00:17:19,673
helping people, supporting people, all of that stuff,

327
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:22,354
that is what you're supposed to do first and foremost.

328
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,723
Now, of course, this means that you will have less time

329
00:17:26,883 --> 00:17:30,746
to work on programming tasks, art tasks, or design tasks.

330
00:17:30,886 --> 00:17:33,929
So depending on the size of the company and your team,

331
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,233
you can expect to spend between 20% and maybe even up

332
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:40,615
to 50% of your time on kind of leadership and management

333
00:17:40,635 --> 00:17:40,895
tasks.

334
00:17:41,576 --> 00:17:44,119
So, you know, make sure to take this into account

335
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,001
and don't overcommit yourself.

336
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:48,464
Because if you take on too much work yourself,

337
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:49,946
chances are you're going to be working a lot,

338
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:50,928
you're going to do over hours,

339
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:52,770
and you might not be as approachable

340
00:17:53,331 --> 00:17:54,232
as you should be.

341
00:17:54,873 --> 00:17:56,755
And that's, again, not a good place to be.

342
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:01,139
But how can we, you know, what specific techniques can you do

343
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:02,460
and what kind of skills are important?

344
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,721
Well, just like with many things in life,

345
00:18:06,022 --> 00:18:08,644
unfortunately there's no real single secret

346
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:09,365
to good leadership.

347
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:12,106
And as I found out myself, if you go to Google

348
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:13,868
and type in like, oh, you know,

349
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:15,129
how can I learn about leadership?

350
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:16,790
You'll find a lot of things like,

351
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,232
10 minute videos that will promise that you know after you watch this you will be the

352
00:18:21,252 --> 00:18:27,495
perfectly or this 20 step program you can read on I don't know ww leadership dot com

353
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:33,318
this is part of it, but I can guarantee you that this will not be like the single thing

354
00:18:33,338 --> 00:18:34,019
you have to read.

355
00:18:34,999 --> 00:18:38,021
In fact, if there's only if there's a singular kind of formula that I.

356
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,063
Except in this regard, it's really this quote from Mike Acton.

357
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:42,883
I really like this.

358
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:46,245
If you absolutely must have a formula for your leadership work,

359
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:47,306
here's mine.

360
00:18:48,006 --> 00:18:50,288
Figure out what doesn't work and do less of that.

361
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:53,009
And figure out what works well and do more of that.

362
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,091
It's so simple, but yet it is important

363
00:18:56,431 --> 00:19:00,254
because it also shows that you're never really done becoming a lead.

364
00:19:00,294 --> 00:19:01,835
You know, just like as a programmer.

365
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:06,142
You're never really done acquiring a maximum kind of skill level in this regard.

366
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:09,548
So it's important to realize that every once in a while you have to take a step back and

367
00:19:09,588 --> 00:19:15,558
kind of think about what you're doing and adjust your strategies.

368
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,761
But what specific things can you do, now that you've been promoted?

369
00:19:21,141 --> 00:19:22,121
Let's get to the meat of things.

370
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:24,802
Personally, I think one of the most important things you can do,

371
00:19:24,862 --> 00:19:27,343
especially if you're just really, really new to this world,

372
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:28,263
is to find a mentor.

373
00:19:28,404 --> 00:19:32,405
And the mentor in this regard is someone that you personally really respect

374
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:35,366
for his or her leadership abilities.

375
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:38,308
Ideally, there would be someone in your own organization

376
00:19:38,389 --> 00:19:40,130
just to make communication much easier

377
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:43,974
and kind of have a faster turnaround time, so to speak,

378
00:19:44,034 --> 00:19:46,437
when talking about specific topics.

379
00:19:47,058 --> 00:19:49,520
It doesn't need to be your direct supervisor, though.

380
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,224
So if you're a programming lead, if you

381
00:19:53,264 --> 00:19:54,465
see someone in the art department

382
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:55,506
doing a fantastic job.

383
00:19:56,492 --> 00:19:59,933
you know, communicating and like leading this team and everybody's motivated and

384
00:19:59,973 --> 00:20:00,834
doing fantastic work.

385
00:20:01,594 --> 00:20:04,835
I encourage you to go to this person and ask, like, hey, is it okay to come by every

386
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,375
once in a while,

387
00:20:05,815 --> 00:20:09,776
you know, talk about some of the challenges I'm facing, adjusting to this role and

388
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:10,897
kind of the progress I'm making.

389
00:20:11,497 --> 00:20:14,598
Because this kind of practical advice that, you know, has been

390
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,719
gathered over years and years of working in this specific role is

391
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:19,560
really invaluable.

392
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,901
And it will allow you to, you know, talk about specific situations you ran into

393
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:25,621
and how you handled these and whether or not that was

394
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:26,842
a good thing to do.

395
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:31,485
But even if you feel like there's no one in your own organization that you can talk to

396
00:20:31,545 --> 00:20:33,426
directly for whatever reason they may be.

397
00:20:35,187 --> 00:20:38,989
I encourage you to reach out to somebody else in the games industry to ask questions if

398
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:39,489
you have them.

399
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:45,613
For example, the Australian artist Zach Duff did this when he was first promoted into an

400
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:46,413
art leadership role.

401
00:20:47,134 --> 00:20:51,076
When he wrote, you know, a mail to John Romero to ask questions about this topic.

402
00:20:51,576 --> 00:20:56,358
And as it seems, I have not seen his email, but as it seems, he felt that was pretty helpful.

403
00:20:57,139 --> 00:21:01,121
And this definitely also reflects my own experience, you know, after I kind of came to the conclusion

404
00:21:01,141 --> 00:21:03,282
that I should probably do a bit more in this regard.

405
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,703
I started writing emails to people I respect very much.

406
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:10,205
for the book in this field and I asked very specific questions

407
00:21:10,245 --> 00:21:12,966
and I found that people are pretty generous with their time

408
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:15,807
and really helpful and really want to help because, you know,

409
00:21:15,887 --> 00:21:19,009
these people have gone through this kind of struggle at some point,

410
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:22,230
so, you know, they're well aware of this problem set.

411
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:27,712
Now, it shouldn't come as a big surprise that communication

412
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:30,633
plays some role in all of this.

413
00:21:31,174 --> 00:21:34,095
In fact, you know, effective communication is probably the key skill

414
00:21:34,135 --> 00:21:35,435
that you will have to work on.

415
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,102
Now that now that you lead and if you can't communicate you

416
00:21:41,142 --> 00:21:43,163
can't really need just make sense.

417
00:21:43,744 --> 00:21:46,545
Now it's important to realize that this may take more time

418
00:21:46,785 --> 00:21:49,847
than you think and you know as a programmer I certainly

419
00:21:50,648 --> 00:21:52,609
went to this myself you know as a program I guess we're

420
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:55,490
a program so generally gets known that you know maybe

421
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:58,992
then all this understandable to the art department design

422
00:21:59,012 --> 00:22:01,773
department and I'm sure that's the you know certain truth

423
00:22:01,794 --> 00:22:04,395
that and for me I had to learn that it's really important

424
00:22:04,415 --> 00:22:05,996
to make sure that you know I change.

425
00:22:06,556 --> 00:22:32,122
The way a communicate depending on who I talk to if I want to talk about even the same system or tool or whatever is to someone on the art department. I have to use different vocabulary and talk of you know different. About different details than if I would talk to someone on the programming team. This is really important. So just you know make sure to to do this and one thing I want to mention at this point. As a newly it's I think.

426
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,287
important to realize that it's OK not to know everything.

427
00:22:35,347 --> 00:22:38,249
Sometimes I feel like there can be this pressure that you kind

428
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:39,669
of have to know everything and you

429
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:41,310
have to be able to do everything all of a sudden

430
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,231
because someone in your work kind of entrusted you

431
00:22:43,251 --> 00:22:43,952
with this position.

432
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:47,674
So I know this pressure, but it's OK not to know everything.

433
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:48,714
It's OK to say, you know what?

434
00:22:48,814 --> 00:22:51,336
I don't actually know this right now, but let me find out,

435
00:22:51,476 --> 00:22:54,077
and then I'm going to come back and talk to you later on.

436
00:22:55,927 --> 00:22:58,128
Now other things that are really important.

437
00:22:58,968 --> 00:23:01,909
But he's you know be proactive if you notice something that's

438
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:05,089
not going well don't wait for somebody else to to solve this

439
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:08,550
problem, you know you in a position where you know you

440
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,071
take on this extra responsibility to so make sure

441
00:23:11,511 --> 00:23:14,251
you know you actually fulfill this role so if you see someone

442
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:17,732
in your team being rude to somebody else don't wait for

443
00:23:17,752 --> 00:23:19,793
somebody to come to you like this is something that you know

444
00:23:19,813 --> 00:23:24,014
you should should deal with on your own terms or by

445
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:31,137
Now, also, especially when it comes to communicate, I think, to your supervisors, you know, do make sure to be transparent.

446
00:23:32,717 --> 00:23:38,960
As a new lead, I think it can be sometimes, for some new leads, it can be hard when things don't go well and, you know, maybe...

447
00:23:39,891 --> 00:23:45,537
There's a problem and maybe you feel like you know, maybe I shouldn't tell anyone I can probably fix this and nobody will ever know

448
00:23:46,117 --> 00:23:46,618
Don't do this

449
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:48,100
You know if something is going wrong

450
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,825
Go to the people that will be affected by that tell them about this and then you find a solution

451
00:23:52,925 --> 00:23:58,551
You know things will go wrong. This is the games industry and I think it's probably applies to all the other industries

452
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:01,054
It's just the way the way it goes

453
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:07,239
Also be clear and I kind of covered us a little bit already, you know, people can't read your mind.

454
00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:14,501
So make sure to break down whatever you want to say in as simply as you can or as clearly as you can rather.

455
00:24:15,101 --> 00:24:22,244
And you know, if you feel like maybe somebody is not quite on the same page, you know, ask probing question, you know, does this make sense?

456
00:24:23,164 --> 00:24:25,105
You know, is there any way I can break us down?

457
00:24:25,145 --> 00:24:26,225
Should I like draw a diagram?

458
00:24:26,245 --> 00:24:29,126
Whatever it may be, you know, be really work on this.

459
00:24:29,186 --> 00:24:30,967
And this is, you know, takes takes some time.

460
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:36,052
Now, one thing I think I completely underestimated

461
00:24:36,112 --> 00:24:40,114
before being in this role is I think

462
00:24:40,454 --> 00:24:41,535
it's the importance of listening.

463
00:24:42,196 --> 00:24:43,917
In my mind, when I thought about leadership,

464
00:24:43,957 --> 00:24:46,838
I always thought about someone standing on a podium

465
00:24:46,978 --> 00:24:49,160
giving an inspiring speech and everybody runs off

466
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,401
and does some amazing work.

467
00:24:51,921 --> 00:24:54,403
But that's in reality not how it works.

468
00:24:54,543 --> 00:24:56,584
And what's actually way more important is that

469
00:24:57,185 --> 00:25:01,269
for you to find out what's happening and gather information and to listen and to really kind

470
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:04,171
of understand who these people are and what their problems are.

471
00:25:04,191 --> 00:25:08,435
There's a saying as a human, you have two ears and one mouth, you should use them in

472
00:25:08,455 --> 00:25:09,016
that ratio.

473
00:25:09,436 --> 00:25:11,578
And I certainly think that this applies to leadership.

474
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:18,084
Now one thing you can do as a specific technique that could, would help you with improving

475
00:25:18,124 --> 00:25:20,527
your listening skills is to ask more open-ended questions.

476
00:25:21,402 --> 00:25:26,026
And open-ended questions are questions that can't be easily answered with yes or no.

477
00:25:26,587 --> 00:25:31,431
And in fact, these are kind of questions where you want to invite your communication partner

478
00:25:31,471 --> 00:25:36,656
to elaborate a little bit more about the topic, and so you can find out about the kind of

479
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:37,977
what and why.

480
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:41,920
And these things are really important to get this excellent information.

481
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:48,628
Now I was for a while thinking about whether I should make this an interactive part of this presentation, but I decided against it.

482
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:58,680
But as an example, let's assume for a second your project lead decides that, you know, all the vehicles in your game should be drivable by the player.

483
00:25:59,561 --> 00:26:03,124
Now, maybe you have to delegate this work.

484
00:26:03,545 --> 00:26:04,706
So you could bring this up to someone

485
00:26:04,766 --> 00:26:07,828
on your team asking an open-ended question,

486
00:26:07,888 --> 00:26:08,289
like this.

487
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:10,831
Hey, James, what do you think about this feature?

488
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:12,813
And how long do you think this will take to implement?

489
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:15,175
Now, compare this to the closed form

490
00:26:15,195 --> 00:26:16,336
where you would say something like this.

491
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:18,798
Hey, James, we decided to add this feature.

492
00:26:18,938 --> 00:26:19,939
Can you get it done this sprint?

493
00:26:21,462 --> 00:26:24,203
Now, this may seem kind of like a very similar question

494
00:26:24,263 --> 00:26:26,103
at first glance, but it's actually a huge difference.

495
00:26:26,143 --> 00:26:28,144
Because in the closed form, really what you're doing,

496
00:26:28,164 --> 00:26:30,025
you're dumping some work on someone else's plate.

497
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:31,965
You're not really interested about any kind

498
00:26:32,005 --> 00:26:33,386
of potential side effects or stuff

499
00:26:33,406 --> 00:26:35,187
that you may not be aware of.

500
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,248
And you're certainly not interested in this person's

501
00:26:38,308 --> 00:26:39,208
input on this feature.

502
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:44,530
And how is this person supposed to feel like this is something

503
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:45,791
to be excited about?

504
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:47,171
So you're not going to get much buy-in.

505
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:48,271
On the other hand.

506
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,724
you know asking this is an open question you what you really doing inviting you

507
00:26:53,764 --> 00:26:56,767
know writing a teammate to kind of work on this feature on this problem.

508
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:01,292
Together with you and because of that you know you're going to first of all

509
00:27:01,312 --> 00:27:05,577
find out about potential side effects problems that you may not be aware of or

510
00:27:06,038 --> 00:27:07,759
maybe it's not a good idea because of that or this.

511
00:27:08,781 --> 00:27:13,585
And generally it shows that you trust this person and that you value this person's input.

512
00:27:14,126 --> 00:27:17,049
And you know, that's going to lead to a very different place.

513
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:20,272
This person hopefully is going to have some buy-in in this feature by the end of it.

514
00:27:20,412 --> 00:27:23,375
And you know, it's just an important thing.

515
00:27:23,456 --> 00:27:27,620
And you know, it takes a little bit of time to get used to kind of restructuring the way you ask questions.

516
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,442
But it's really helpful.

517
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:31,023
So I can only...

518
00:27:32,004 --> 00:27:32,945
I suggest you do this.

519
00:27:33,126 --> 00:27:35,869
Now, another listening technique that's really helpful,

520
00:27:35,949 --> 00:27:38,792
especially when kind of dealing with kind

521
00:27:38,832 --> 00:27:39,893
of difficult conversations.

522
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:42,756
So, you know, something is not going well,

523
00:27:42,776 --> 00:27:44,638
there's a problem, maybe people blame each other

524
00:27:44,678 --> 00:27:47,161
for the problem, emotions are running high.

525
00:27:47,181 --> 00:27:49,583
This is an ideal situation to use a technique

526
00:27:49,603 --> 00:27:50,805
that's called active listening.

527
00:27:51,665 --> 00:27:54,587
An act of listening, the idea is to essentially minimize

528
00:27:54,747 --> 00:27:56,189
the chance of miscommunication.

529
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,792
And you do this by restating or paraphrasing

530
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,274
what your communication partner says back to him

531
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:03,315
using your own words.

532
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,957
Now obviously, you want to first think

533
00:28:05,997 --> 00:28:08,619
about what the person said and then paraphrase that.

534
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,201
So the idea here is that you essentially

535
00:28:11,621 --> 00:28:14,722
make sure that the other person can hear what you think he

536
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:17,903
or she said, so that if there is any miscommunication,

537
00:28:18,624 --> 00:28:19,964
that it can be resolved right away.

538
00:28:19,984 --> 00:28:23,706
I certainly had my fair share of conversations, both at work

539
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:26,787
and with my wife, where we're talking,

540
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:30,028
and I just feel like, why does this person not get it?

541
00:28:30,128 --> 00:28:30,909
It's so clear.

542
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:33,750
Only to find out eventually that actually we're

543
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:35,570
actually talking about different aspects, perhaps

544
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,331
of the same topic.

545
00:28:37,752 --> 00:28:38,694
This will help you with this.

546
00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:41,078
It's a very, very helpful technique.

547
00:28:41,098 --> 00:28:43,001
And it will also become very, very handy

548
00:28:43,101 --> 00:28:46,967
in one of the most important things you can do as a lead.

549
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:49,552
And this is one-on-one meetings.

550
00:28:50,387 --> 00:28:57,255
Now as the name suggests, the idea here is to meet with everyone on your team on a kind of regular basis to kind of a face to face conversation.

551
00:28:57,995 --> 00:29:08,528
And this is important because now that you're responsible for the workload of a group of people, you really have to know the people on your team because how else are you going to be able to lead these people, right?

552
00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:10,110
You have to know what...

553
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:13,991
what they're good at, what they're not good at, what they enjoy working on, what they don't enjoy working on.

554
00:29:15,191 --> 00:29:18,531
And the only way of finding out is by asking them about these kind of topics.

555
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:21,932
And this also will really help you to kind of establish,

556
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:25,073
well, hopefully, to establish this kind of environment of mutual trust.

557
00:29:26,213 --> 00:29:29,494
Hopefully you're going to get to a situation where your team will realize,

558
00:29:30,314 --> 00:29:34,355
yes, I can talk to my lead about these kind of topics and potentially

559
00:29:34,395 --> 00:29:37,156
also about something that's going wrong and nothing bad will happen.

560
00:29:39,076 --> 00:29:41,197
So this is a great thing to do.

561
00:29:42,438 --> 00:29:44,600
Now, one thing I kind of found out myself is,

562
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:47,361
you know, definitely made this mistake myself,

563
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:49,943
is ideally don't skip these meetings.

564
00:29:49,983 --> 00:29:51,144
You know, towards the end of a project,

565
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,164
things can get stressful.

566
00:29:53,866 --> 00:29:56,007
So it's easy to say, well, you know,

567
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:57,528
let's just not do it right now.

568
00:29:58,008 --> 00:29:59,569
It's OK, I think, to have a short meeting.

569
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,650
But ideally, you would keep this going.

570
00:30:01,711 --> 00:30:03,792
And this is something.

571
00:30:05,453 --> 00:30:06,454
yeah, that I learned myself.

572
00:30:07,415 --> 00:30:09,677
Also pick a location where you can potentially

573
00:30:09,997 --> 00:30:11,098
discuss sensitive topics.

574
00:30:11,158 --> 00:30:14,401
So a meeting room in your office is a great place, of course.

575
00:30:15,402 --> 00:30:17,504
You can also go to a nearby coffee shop if you want.

576
00:30:18,005 --> 00:30:20,287
As long as both of you can feel comfortable,

577
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:23,770
don't need to be worried about somebody else just dropping in

578
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:26,453
and potentially overhearing a part of the conversation

579
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:28,255
that they shouldn't hear.

580
00:30:29,676 --> 00:30:37,660
Now one thing that's kind of, I think, often misunderstood, I feel, is that what you should talk about in these meetings.

581
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,861
And it's important that this is not a status update.

582
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:47,965
So ideally, the core of this conversation should not be about what the task load is and we know when it will be done.

583
00:30:49,025 --> 00:30:50,586
This can be a starter, but you should...

584
00:30:51,046 --> 00:30:54,109
concentrate on trying to figure out you know career goals can a problem set

585
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:58,814
happening and other things so off try asking questions like you know to enjoy

586
00:30:58,854 --> 00:31:02,318
what you're working on is there something else you want to would prefer

587
00:31:02,358 --> 00:31:05,081
to work on is this something you want to learn where do you want to be in 5

588
00:31:05,121 --> 00:31:05,301
years.

589
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:10,005
you know, if there's something if there's one thing you could

590
00:31:10,025 --> 00:31:12,346
change on the project right now, what would that be.

591
00:31:13,527 --> 00:31:15,689
Now, of course, don't ask all of these questions

592
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:18,230
and the first meeting you meet with when

593
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,671
you meet with your teammate.

594
00:31:20,432 --> 00:31:21,813
All you're going to find out is how patient

595
00:31:21,853 --> 00:31:23,454
your teammate is at this point.

596
00:31:23,474 --> 00:31:24,134
So don't do that.

597
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:28,157
But it's just to give you some kind of idea of hopefully

598
00:31:28,197 --> 00:31:31,680
what you should talk about and try to find out.

599
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,502
And what's really important is to.

600
00:31:35,745 --> 00:31:39,366
make sure to really listen when you go to these meetings.

601
00:31:39,426 --> 00:31:40,887
Don't have these meetings in front of a computer

602
00:31:40,907 --> 00:31:43,007
where you can see email notifications popping up

603
00:31:43,808 --> 00:31:44,288
every minute.

604
00:31:44,388 --> 00:31:46,509
Or if you have to bring your mobile phone along,

605
00:31:46,749 --> 00:31:47,709
make sure to silence it.

606
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,490
Because the important part is to make sure

607
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,611
that you concentrate on this conversation

608
00:31:52,751 --> 00:31:55,992
and that your teammate can feel valued and important.

609
00:31:56,032 --> 00:31:58,133
And that's how it should be.

610
00:31:58,213 --> 00:31:59,593
Because nothing is worse than having

611
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:02,715
a half-assed conversation where you're just

612
00:32:02,735 --> 00:32:04,435
responding with, uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh, OK.

613
00:32:06,036 --> 00:32:09,398
That really shows disrespect, so don't do this.

614
00:32:09,498 --> 00:32:14,681
And lastly, if there's something like an actual actionable item that comes out of this, like...

615
00:32:15,817 --> 00:32:18,559
We should send you the course, or we should send you to GDC.

616
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,842
Make sure to write this down so you don't forget about it,

617
00:32:21,962 --> 00:32:23,904
and send it to the person you talk to,

618
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:27,908
so you both kind of have this as a baseline in written down

619
00:32:27,968 --> 00:32:28,228
form.

620
00:32:28,608 --> 00:32:30,971
And it will also help you to kind of later on look at,

621
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,612
OK, what did we talk about in the past?

622
00:32:32,672 --> 00:32:35,395
What kind of specific actionable things that should happen?

623
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:39,939
Now, one thing that's, I think, really hard,

624
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:41,820
especially if you're new to this role, is how to.

625
00:32:43,742 --> 00:32:46,184
how to deal with expectations and that it's important to set

626
00:32:46,905 --> 00:32:52,029
expectations because as a newly, you know it can be you can feel

627
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:55,573
like you know who are you or like you know who am I to to

628
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,875
to tell these people to do their job. Yeah, I'm not.

629
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:01,078
You know, I'm so new in this role, but this is not really

630
00:33:01,118 --> 00:33:03,380
what it's about it's not about telling people how to do their

631
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,161
job it's about.

632
00:33:06,074 --> 00:33:10,675
letting people know what is important to you and what would frustrate you if not done well.

633
00:33:12,116 --> 00:33:17,717
Because what is really bad would be a situation where you get back some kind of task from someone

634
00:33:17,737 --> 00:33:22,279
and you look at it and then you say like yeah, you know, this is good, but can you change it

635
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:27,300
according to these rules I never told you? That's very frustrating. So ideally don't do that.

636
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:32,284
And of course, you know, try not to go in and change things yourself.

637
00:33:33,005 --> 00:33:35,307
That will really make you appear like a micromanager

638
00:33:35,908 --> 00:33:40,012
and chances are people don't want to, you know, why should they invest their time

639
00:33:40,372 --> 00:33:42,014
if you're just going to go in and change it anyway.

640
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:46,718
So this is really important if you want to reduce your frustration.

641
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:48,760
So as a programmer, it's a specific example.

642
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,662
If coding standards are really important to you,

643
00:33:51,443 --> 00:33:53,685
you make sure to let your team know that this is the case.

644
00:33:54,725 --> 00:33:56,987
Because nothing is worse than having some kind of unspoken

645
00:33:57,027 --> 00:33:58,488
rules that nobody really knows about.

646
00:33:58,508 --> 00:34:03,372
OK, so one thing that's also, I think, really, really hard

647
00:34:03,512 --> 00:34:06,334
for a lot of new leads is how to delegate

648
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:09,336
and to kind of get used to this idea of delegation.

649
00:34:11,627 --> 00:34:13,788
And I personally found that one way of actually doing this,

650
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,329
getting used to this kind of in a good way,

651
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:19,490
is an easy way, is by having sprint planning meetings.

652
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,051
And the idea here is to get everyone

653
00:34:21,071 --> 00:34:22,952
in the team into a room.

654
00:34:22,972 --> 00:34:25,493
And you first talk about what you did in the previous sprint,

655
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:28,154
and kind of what got done, what didn't get done,

656
00:34:28,174 --> 00:34:29,254
why it didn't get done.

657
00:34:29,874 --> 00:34:32,296
And then you talk about what needs to get done for the next sprint.

658
00:34:32,536 --> 00:34:39,781
And at this point you can invite people on your team to just grab the tasks they would prefer to work on.

659
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:46,225
And hopefully this is going to lead to a situation where people on your team are actually pretty happy with the majority of their tasks.

660
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:49,187
Now, of course there will be stuff that nobody wants to do.

661
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:51,549
You know, whatever this may be.

662
00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:54,951
Writing yet another safe system, UI, I don't know, whatever it is.

663
00:34:55,852 --> 00:34:57,073
So you still have to deal with that.

664
00:34:59,314 --> 00:35:00,656
You could take that task on yourself.

665
00:35:00,996 --> 00:35:02,759
That's totally OK if you want to be a nice boss

666
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,421
and you want to make sure that everyone in your team

667
00:35:04,441 --> 00:35:06,123
only has the task they want.

668
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:09,227
But of course, do remember, don't overcommit yourself.

669
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:11,089
Don't say, yeah, yeah, I will do all these things

670
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,052
if you're just going to be stressed out afterwards.

671
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,099
So also at this point.

672
00:35:19,744 --> 00:35:23,965
This is a good place to talk about kind of some of the potential implications that come with these

673
00:35:24,565 --> 00:35:27,306
with these tasks, you know, how will that work with multiplayer,

674
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:31,727
will that bloat it, you know, the texture limit, texture memory limit,

675
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:35,728
stuff like that, just kind of ask probing questions and you know, hopefully your experience

676
00:35:36,228 --> 00:35:40,790
as an individual contributor will guide you here to kind of ask the relevant questions.

677
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,291
Now one thing that I kind of had to learn.

678
00:35:47,098 --> 00:35:49,681
over the, you know, while adjusting to this, it's kind of,

679
00:35:50,402 --> 00:35:53,405
that delegation really goes further, further than this.

680
00:35:55,328 --> 00:35:57,891
It's also, it's not just about work distribution,

681
00:35:57,911 --> 00:36:00,073
it's also about making sure to keep your team involved

682
00:36:00,113 --> 00:36:03,077
in the kind of day-to-day kind of decision-making process.

683
00:36:03,617 --> 00:36:07,740
Because it's important to remember that the people on your team are really the domain experts.

684
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,862
These are the people who are down in the trenches doing the actual work.

685
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:14,824
They know all the details about whatever it is that, you know, your group does.

686
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:17,766
And even you may not know all those details.

687
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:23,410
So if it comes to kind of questions about these parts,

688
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,451
do make sure to keep them...

689
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:30,940
to keep them involved in this as well and I certainly you know

690
00:36:31,701 --> 00:36:34,822
found this out the hard way and you know you can certainly

691
00:36:34,842 --> 00:36:40,525
if you know start kind of over stepping over people and like not thinking

692
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:40,905
about this

693
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:45,047
you can certainly lead to like hurt feelings and people

694
00:36:45,427 --> 00:36:48,649
feeling like you know you don't trust them with with answering questions or

695
00:36:48,689 --> 00:36:49,309
something like that.

696
00:36:50,261 --> 00:36:54,242
Now, lastly, delegation is also a great, great tool

697
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:55,323
for skill development.

698
00:36:56,883 --> 00:36:58,744
Because most people don't really enjoy

699
00:36:58,804 --> 00:37:00,104
working on repetitive tasks.

700
00:37:00,624 --> 00:37:02,585
I don't know about you, but I certainly

701
00:37:02,605 --> 00:37:05,066
am most happy at work if I'm doing something that's

702
00:37:05,086 --> 00:37:06,926
challenging me, and I feel like at the end of the day,

703
00:37:06,966 --> 00:37:07,827
I learned something new.

704
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:10,428
And that's true for most people.

705
00:37:11,048 --> 00:37:12,892
Now, of course, one-on-one meetings

706
00:37:12,952 --> 00:37:15,918
are a great way to find out how somebody

707
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,446
feels about doing the same thing again, over and over again,

708
00:37:19,546 --> 00:37:20,929
or maybe wanting to be challenged.

709
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,441
at which point or how much this person wants to be challenged.

710
00:37:27,302 --> 00:37:30,663
So let's assume for a kind of a made up but specific example,

711
00:37:31,063 --> 00:37:32,524
let's say you're leading an art team.

712
00:37:33,004 --> 00:37:35,245
And for the next sprint, you have to model an orc.

713
00:37:35,805 --> 00:37:38,226
Now, you could give this task to one of your senior artists

714
00:37:38,586 --> 00:37:43,267
who has modeled several orcs for the last couple of projects.

715
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:45,148
And you know this person will get this done

716
00:37:45,188 --> 00:37:47,449
in a pretty short amount of time and to the quality level

717
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:48,189
that you expect.

718
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:52,351
Now, but maybe you recently hired a junior artist who

719
00:37:53,552 --> 00:37:55,633
has expressed his interest in character modeling

720
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,094
in one of the one-on-one meetings.

721
00:37:57,754 --> 00:37:59,595
Now, if time permits, you may actually

722
00:37:59,615 --> 00:38:01,616
want to consider giving this task to the junior artist,

723
00:38:02,217 --> 00:38:04,678
even though it will take this person probably longer

724
00:38:04,718 --> 00:38:08,300
to get it done and it will take a couple of iterations

725
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,801
to get to the quality level that you want to.

726
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:13,103
But it will help this person to develop these skills.

727
00:38:13,143 --> 00:38:15,044
And that will become helpful.

728
00:38:15,924 --> 00:38:17,965
Probably it will help yourself, because later on your team

729
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:20,527
can take on more challenges.

730
00:38:21,027 --> 00:38:22,428
And it will also help this person,

731
00:38:22,448 --> 00:38:25,589
because as you learned, he or she is very excited about it.

732
00:38:25,669 --> 00:38:28,711
So hopefully this person will be very motivated about it.

733
00:38:28,771 --> 00:38:30,352
And if you want to get extra points as a lead,

734
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:33,013
try pairing up the senior artists and the junior artists

735
00:38:33,033 --> 00:38:34,734
so they can share experiences.

736
00:38:34,754 --> 00:38:39,137
That will also help a lot.

737
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:44,422
Now, of course, now that the work distribution aspect is done,

738
00:38:44,542 --> 00:38:46,282
your job as a lead is not over.

739
00:38:48,163 --> 00:38:49,723
As a lead, you're really representing your team,

740
00:38:49,743 --> 00:38:51,783
which means you have to know what's up

741
00:38:51,923 --> 00:38:54,964
and what the progress is of everyone in your team,

742
00:38:55,004 --> 00:38:56,064
not just your own workload.

743
00:38:56,604 --> 00:38:59,285
And I think this is a point where sometimes this kind

744
00:38:59,325 --> 00:39:01,445
of my actual job syndrome can kick in.

745
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,325
You feel like, I distributed work.

746
00:39:03,505 --> 00:39:05,866
Great, everybody knows what to do for the next two weeks.

747
00:39:06,286 --> 00:39:10,909
I'm just going to like be heads down and write some code or draw some textures or you know balance

748
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:12,270
some some specialties for units.

749
00:39:13,891 --> 00:39:18,273
Make sure to take some time to stay up to date what's going on in your team and the

750
00:39:18,293 --> 00:39:22,576
different ways of doing that I know people who really like reading checking comments

751
00:39:22,836 --> 00:39:26,498
and purpose for example to kind of stay up to date what's happening there if you have

752
00:39:26,518 --> 00:39:28,939
a producer that's walking around in your team was kind of.

753
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,842
checking in anyway, you know, have a coffee with the producer and figure out what's going on this way.

754
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:36,403
Or, of course, just walk around yourself and talk to people.

755
00:39:36,483 --> 00:39:40,366
And this comes as the added benefit that you hopefully hear about potential problems

756
00:39:41,066 --> 00:39:43,567
way before they become an actual issue

757
00:39:44,027 --> 00:39:47,049
and so that you can do something, you know, at the earliest possible time.

758
00:39:47,069 --> 00:39:49,130
Okay.

759
00:39:50,486 --> 00:39:54,707
So now I want to talk about a topic that's probably

760
00:39:54,907 --> 00:39:57,468
the hardest lesson for most new leads,

761
00:39:57,568 --> 00:40:00,189
at least that's came out of the conversation

762
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:00,869
that I had with other leads.

763
00:40:00,909 --> 00:40:03,950
And that is the importance of providing feedback

764
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:05,331
and how to provide feedback.

765
00:40:05,691 --> 00:40:07,892
And I want to talk about both the negative side of things

766
00:40:08,152 --> 00:40:09,972
as well as the positive side of things.

767
00:40:10,913 --> 00:40:11,873
Let's start with criticism.

768
00:40:14,317 --> 00:40:18,800
As a lead, it's important that you take this part of your role

769
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,442
also seriously, because you're responsible for what's

770
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:23,103
going on your team.

771
00:40:23,143 --> 00:40:25,664
And if something is not going well, you have to deal with this.

772
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:27,365
You can't just push this out.

773
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:31,090
because in my experience problems never go away,

774
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,432
they just become worse.

775
00:40:32,572 --> 00:40:34,154
So, you know, deal with it.

776
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:36,158
And this won't be a fun conversation, of course,

777
00:40:36,258 --> 00:40:39,903
you know, and it's probably not gonna be the best day at work,

778
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:41,646
but that's okay.

779
00:40:42,447 --> 00:40:44,270
It's just you have to get used to this.

780
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,612
Let's assume for a second again as a kind of a made up example

781
00:40:48,652 --> 00:40:51,073
is that someone on your team keeps breaking the build.

782
00:40:51,613 --> 00:40:53,714
And that's beside the fact that you explained

783
00:40:54,374 --> 00:40:57,155
that this will disrupt the entire team or project.

784
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:00,015
And you even explained, OK, the way to avoid this,

785
00:41:00,055 --> 00:41:01,896
make sure to test all your changes locally

786
00:41:01,956 --> 00:41:02,756
and then check it in.

787
00:41:03,316 --> 00:41:04,117
But it didn't help.

788
00:41:04,517 --> 00:41:05,577
You did all that.

789
00:41:05,637 --> 00:41:06,597
It's still happening.

790
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,378
Now, you have to deal with this.

791
00:41:09,198 --> 00:41:11,519
Don't wait for somebody else from another team

792
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:13,900
to come and say, hey, what's going on with this person?

793
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,921
Now one thing you shouldn't do is to walk into this person's work area and start, you know,

794
00:41:19,961 --> 00:41:25,443
criticizing the person right there. Because if you criticize people in the open, in public,

795
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:29,664
all that will happen is that this person will end up in a defensive position, right?

796
00:41:29,704 --> 00:41:33,945
Because what they're probably mostly concerned about at this point is not to lose respect in

797
00:41:33,985 --> 00:41:35,785
front of his or her work colleagues.

798
00:41:36,645 --> 00:41:40,187
So instead get a meeting room and have a discussion there.

799
00:41:40,928 --> 00:41:42,589
And at this point, you do make sure

800
00:41:42,729 --> 00:41:44,770
you approach this conversation with empathy.

801
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,051
There may be things going on in this person's life

802
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:49,232
that you're not aware of, whatever this may be.

803
00:41:49,753 --> 00:41:52,374
So don't storm in there and wave your finger and say,

804
00:41:52,394 --> 00:41:54,395
if you don't stop this in the next week,

805
00:41:55,336 --> 00:41:56,616
I will make sure that you get fired.

806
00:41:57,037 --> 00:41:58,597
That's not a good way to approach that.

807
00:41:58,617 --> 00:41:58,958
If you have a

808
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:02,800
If you have a kid and maybe you're here from school,

809
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,702
your kid is not handing in the homework on time,

810
00:42:05,722 --> 00:42:07,624
you're hopefully not going to storm in your kid's room

811
00:42:07,644 --> 00:42:08,405
and say, you know what?

812
00:42:08,805 --> 00:42:10,186
If you don't start handing in your homework,

813
00:42:10,226 --> 00:42:11,627
I'm going to fire you from this family.

814
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:15,230
Instead, I hope what you would do is say,

815
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,472
you know I heard about this issue with the homework.

816
00:42:18,492 --> 00:42:19,133
What's going on?

817
00:42:19,173 --> 00:42:20,454
Is there any way I can help you with this?

818
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:24,309
And ideally, you want to approach this situation

819
00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:25,230
exactly the same way.

820
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,192
As a team lead, as I said earlier,

821
00:42:27,332 --> 00:42:29,355
one of your responsibilities is to support your team.

822
00:42:29,395 --> 00:42:31,837
And that means sometimes to make sure

823
00:42:31,898 --> 00:42:34,120
to help people who struggle with whatever

824
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,201
it may be at this point.

825
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:40,706
Now, you know, do make sure to find out what's going on,

826
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:44,289
you know, if your teammate trusts you with that information.

827
00:42:44,769 --> 00:42:47,271
And then work on a plan together, like figure out,

828
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,952
you know, these are specific things we can do

829
00:42:49,472 --> 00:42:51,293
to not be in a situation anymore.

830
00:42:51,854 --> 00:42:54,296
Then write this down and, you know, send it,

831
00:42:54,676 --> 00:42:56,317
send it as a form, in form of an email

832
00:42:56,397 --> 00:42:57,458
to this person you talked to.

833
00:42:58,018 --> 00:42:59,579
And then, of course, going forward, you know,

834
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,501
do make sure to check in and see how it's going and, you know,

835
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:04,783
ask, well, first of all, you hopefully should see

836
00:43:04,803 --> 00:43:06,184
whether the situation is improving.

837
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:10,448
but also you know to inquire like hey this this plan working for you

838
00:43:10,908 --> 00:43:11,949
says something we should change.

839
00:43:13,771 --> 00:43:17,194
So this is kind of an important aspect now

840
00:43:18,115 --> 00:43:22,299
on the other end of the spectrum is also praise and I think sometimes as a.

841
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:24,798
Here we go.

842
00:43:24,978 --> 00:43:25,539
It's praise.

843
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:27,661
And I think sometimes as a new lead,

844
00:43:28,462 --> 00:43:29,923
it's very easy and kind of natural

845
00:43:29,943 --> 00:43:32,986
to concentrate on the things that you like to change.

846
00:43:33,126 --> 00:43:35,949
And you like to tell people, hey, don't do it like this.

847
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:36,650
Don't do it like that.

848
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:40,333
And it's way too often and very common

849
00:43:40,353 --> 00:43:42,976
that leads will kind of forget to tell people.

850
00:43:43,717 --> 00:43:49,387
that they're doing well and to praise them, but it's important to tell your teammates

851
00:43:49,447 --> 00:43:52,633
that, you know, if they're doing a good job, that they are doing a good job, because most

852
00:43:52,673 --> 00:43:56,199
people really want to know how they're doing and hopefully that they're doing well.

853
00:43:57,355 --> 00:43:59,837
And so just a few little words like, hey, well done,

854
00:43:59,997 --> 00:44:01,477
or the way you kind of solve this problem,

855
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:04,339
I really like this, go already a long way.

856
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:09,141
And unlike with criticism, it's totally OK,

857
00:44:09,181 --> 00:44:10,882
and I would say, in fact, encouraged

858
00:44:11,322 --> 00:44:12,383
to praise people in public.

859
00:44:13,223 --> 00:44:19,346
Because you share kind of this success with a wider audience.

860
00:44:19,526 --> 00:44:22,147
And hopefully this will kind of boost team morale.

861
00:44:22,627 --> 00:44:25,529
So if you have a meeting at work where

862
00:44:25,549 --> 00:44:26,209
you're representing.

863
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,362
your team, maybe to an entire project, make sure to kind of, you know, mention that,

864
00:44:30,382 --> 00:44:33,643
hey, you know, these cool things happened, and this is the person who was responsible

865
00:44:33,683 --> 00:44:34,043
for that.

866
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:41,647
You know, hope, you know, this will make feel, make people feel important, and that's really

867
00:44:41,667 --> 00:44:43,567
an important thing.

868
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:53,200
After hearing all of these things, you may think like, man, this leadership thing is

869
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,041
pretty hard.

870
00:44:54,101 --> 00:44:56,963
Maybe there were a few things I didn't really think about before.

871
00:44:56,983 --> 00:45:02,826
And that's true, you know, adjusting to this role is pretty tough and takes a while.

872
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:04,107
It's not an easy thing to do.

873
00:45:05,428 --> 00:45:06,408
But it is impossible.

874
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:08,430
It is not impossible.

875
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:09,150
It is possible.

876
00:45:10,312 --> 00:45:11,854
That would be the weirdest message ever.

877
00:45:11,894 --> 00:45:12,615
Guys, sorry.

878
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:14,178
Thanks for spending an hour with me,

879
00:45:14,258 --> 00:45:15,701
but it's actually not happening.

880
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:16,362
No.

881
00:45:19,026 --> 00:45:20,649
It is definitely possible.

882
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,852
And you can work on these skills.

883
00:45:24,375 --> 00:45:40,153
You can adjust to this role even if it right now it seems like you know how many start getting used to this and you know, maybe I already been a lead for half a year and that anything doesn't matter you know start doing some of the same set up one on one meetings put in your calendar and whatever it may be.

884
00:45:41,154 --> 00:45:44,356
I really like this quote from Brian Sharpe's talk

885
00:45:45,096 --> 00:45:47,998
here at GDC in 2012, when he said

886
00:45:48,058 --> 00:45:50,119
that when it comes to leadership,

887
00:45:50,139 --> 00:45:53,381
there's this misconception that comprehension equals mastery,

888
00:45:54,022 --> 00:45:55,442
when it's clearly not the case.

889
00:45:56,143 --> 00:45:57,704
Just because you read all the books

890
00:45:57,944 --> 00:46:00,365
or seen all the presentations about leadership, by the way,

891
00:46:00,406 --> 00:46:01,746
thanks for coming to this presentation,

892
00:46:02,267 --> 00:46:05,128
doesn't necessarily mean that you're automatically

893
00:46:05,188 --> 00:46:07,770
going to be the most awesome lead the next day at work

894
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,551
and will be able to apply all these things.

895
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:12,994
In a German language, you have the saying that no master ever

896
00:46:13,034 --> 00:46:17,100
fell from the sky, meaning that nobody ever gets all the skills

897
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,883
that he or she needs overnight.

898
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:22,609
And it takes time to learn these things and dedication.

899
00:46:23,548 --> 00:46:26,329
And you know another thing that's Brian said in this talk is that

900
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:30,451
practice is really the opposite of hoping. So rather than saying,

901
00:46:30,651 --> 00:46:33,972
oh man, I hope I will be like one of those awesome bosses I had in the past.

902
00:46:34,773 --> 00:46:37,834
The only way to get there is by actually, you know, working on this and

903
00:46:37,854 --> 00:46:40,735
kind of taking a step back, thinking about does this work, you know,

904
00:46:40,755 --> 00:46:42,956
should I change some of my strategies.

905
00:46:44,203 --> 00:46:48,705
And really this is just the beginning if you're new to this role this is a

906
00:46:48,725 --> 00:46:52,687
fantastic time in your career it's very exciting you know some obviously people

907
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:57,970
at your work think that you know you're ready for this and that you have what it

908
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:59,531
takes to fulfill this role.

909
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:03,433
But it will take time to kind of learn this

910
00:47:03,533 --> 00:47:05,154
and to kind of flex your leadership muscles.

911
00:47:05,354 --> 00:47:09,777
But being a teammate is a great place to be.

912
00:47:10,277 --> 00:47:12,038
And it still baffles me to kind of think

913
00:47:12,078 --> 00:47:14,640
about at the end of the week how much work gets done.

914
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,021
It is just such an amazing feeling.

915
00:47:17,522 --> 00:47:19,403
And really, all I talked about today

916
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:22,285
is really just kind of the fundamentals of this.

917
00:47:22,785 --> 00:47:25,326
It's the most basic things I think you should know about.

918
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:29,009
And I hope this will help you to hit the ground running.

919
00:47:34,512 --> 00:47:39,655
And, you know, it will hopefully make it easier for you than it was for me, perhaps, and some

920
00:47:39,675 --> 00:47:40,736
of the other leads I talked to.

921
00:47:41,756 --> 00:47:46,459
And unfortunately, before I make any more weird things and say weird stuff, this is

922
00:47:46,499 --> 00:47:47,640
all I have time to talk about.

923
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,982
So thank you very much for your attention, and I'm happy to answer questions.

924
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:01,410
Thank you.

925
00:48:04,572 --> 00:48:04,933
Hello.

926
00:48:05,373 --> 00:48:05,513
Hey.

927
00:48:05,533 --> 00:48:05,873
Can you hear me?

928
00:48:06,054 --> 00:48:06,254
Yeah.

929
00:48:06,434 --> 00:48:07,114
Yeah.

930
00:48:07,254 --> 00:48:09,576
Can you share your thoughts on the role of the leader

931
00:48:09,656 --> 00:48:10,557
when things go wrong?

932
00:48:10,857 --> 00:48:12,018
Who should have the blame,

933
00:48:12,058 --> 00:48:13,900
especially going up to management and whatnot?

934
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,941
So can you repeat the first part of this question?

935
00:48:16,982 --> 00:48:19,023
What are your thoughts when things go wrong?

936
00:48:19,604 --> 00:48:20,445
What is the leader's role?

937
00:48:21,589 --> 00:48:23,210
Well, I think first and foremost,

938
00:48:24,531 --> 00:48:26,472
I think blaming people is the complete.

939
00:48:26,532 --> 00:48:27,473
Oh, I should repeat the question.

940
00:48:27,493 --> 00:48:30,135
What is the role the leader has when things go wrong?

941
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,398
I think first and foremost, blaming people on your team,

942
00:48:34,458 --> 00:48:35,598
I don't think it's the right approach.

943
00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:38,801
In fact, very often what you'll read

944
00:48:38,841 --> 00:48:40,342
is something like, as a good leader,

945
00:48:40,402 --> 00:48:43,284
really what you should do is accept all the blame yourself,

946
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:47,126
and then share all the praise, and give that out.

947
00:48:47,707 --> 00:48:50,729
And I think my personal opinion is that.

948
00:48:52,261 --> 00:48:57,105
try not to make this an emotional thing like if there's a problem, you know try

949
00:48:57,145 --> 00:49:01,668
to be as rational as possible like look you know these things happen you know

950
00:49:02,269 --> 00:49:06,733
whatever reason this this may be let's try to figure out what what can be done

951
00:49:07,513 --> 00:49:12,437
and then you know do everything you can to to kind of solve this problem but I

952
00:49:12,457 --> 00:49:14,939
would definitely say like don't go around and you know go to a bus and

953
00:49:14,979 --> 00:49:15,459
saying you know

954
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:19,001
It all went wrong because James did it wrong.

955
00:49:19,021 --> 00:49:20,222
I could have told you.

956
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:22,683
And even if that's the case, even if James did something

957
00:49:22,723 --> 00:49:25,465
wrong, I hope there are no Jameses here.

958
00:49:26,345 --> 00:49:29,867
Even if that's the case, then it's still your responsibility,

959
00:49:29,927 --> 00:49:30,127
right?

960
00:49:30,187 --> 00:49:31,448
Because what did you do during the day?

961
00:49:31,488 --> 00:49:32,789
Like, how did it get to this point

962
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:34,290
that you didn't notice that this happened?

963
00:49:35,571 --> 00:49:38,753
So I like this book. I actually have it in my resource section.

964
00:49:38,793 --> 00:49:40,155
Let's see if I can get there.

965
00:49:41,015 --> 00:49:43,217
It's called Difficult Conversations.

966
00:49:43,878 --> 00:49:46,240
How to Discuss Matters That Matter Most.

967
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,942
And in this book, the authors discuss

968
00:49:49,223 --> 00:49:52,305
kind of how to approach these kind of situations from a different angle

969
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:55,448
and to essentially kind of change the way you look at this.

970
00:49:56,009 --> 00:49:59,914
from kind of a blaming point of view to more like a contribution like how what

971
00:49:59,954 --> 00:50:04,661
was my role in this like how did it get to this point and you will find

972
00:50:04,721 --> 00:50:08,427
hopefully at this will actually was off the problem in a much better way than

973
00:50:08,808 --> 00:50:09,168
otherwise.

974
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:36,260
Hi, I'm Natalie. I wanted to ask about, well often when you're a team leader, then you have a situation where you have people working under you who are much more experienced, much more like objectively have more knowledge. And I've been there, so I'm kind of wondering if you've had any difficult situations around that, decision making that has been hard, and if you can share a story about that.

975
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:36,860
Right, right.

976
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:38,582
So the question is, what do you do

977
00:50:38,602 --> 00:50:42,827
if you're responsible for people who actually have more work

978
00:50:42,867 --> 00:50:44,589
experience in this field than yourself?

979
00:50:44,769 --> 00:50:45,290
Is that correct?

980
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:48,393
Yeah, so actually, this is kind of how I started out.

981
00:50:48,453 --> 00:50:49,955
So when I talked about in the beginning,

982
00:50:50,135 --> 00:50:51,817
that was my situation where.

983
00:50:52,818 --> 00:50:55,160
You're kind of really in the spot where you feel like,

984
00:50:55,641 --> 00:50:56,721
man, how can I, you know,

985
00:50:57,202 --> 00:50:59,644
who am I to tell this person who has way more work experience

986
00:51:00,685 --> 00:51:02,126
than me that how to do things.

987
00:51:04,208 --> 00:51:07,611
I think it's important and, you know, this is really hard.

988
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:08,852
I think what you should do is like...

989
00:51:09,553 --> 00:51:13,114
You know have a one-on-one meeting and actually be pretty candid and say like you know look I

990
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:16,935
realize that you you know you have way more work experience in this in this

991
00:51:16,955 --> 00:51:19,516
field than myself and I'm really new to this role.

992
00:51:20,537 --> 00:51:26,399
So you know if there's actually anything I can learn from you that would be great to just kind of get to this

993
00:51:26,499 --> 00:51:30,460
point where it's hopefully not as awkward anymore and that you kind of feel like you can trust each other

994
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,901
and if this person.

995
00:51:32,621 --> 00:51:35,143
it's been around for a long time and perhaps been in the same situation,

996
00:51:35,163 --> 00:51:39,627
then, you know, chances are that this person will actually understand what you're talking about.

997
00:51:39,727 --> 00:51:43,610
So, try not to, I guess, try not to like, you know, brush it on the carpet,

998
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:47,013
but actually bring it up and like talk about this very specifically.

999
00:51:47,033 --> 00:51:48,735
Thank you.

1000
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,436
You're welcome.

1001
00:51:50,516 --> 00:51:50,576
Hi.

1002
00:51:51,388 --> 00:51:52,489
First of all, thanks for the talk.

1003
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:53,409
That was really amazing.

1004
00:51:53,429 --> 00:51:54,330
Thank you.

1005
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:57,953
And so my question is more, so I'm a game designer.

1006
00:51:58,293 --> 00:52:01,035
And at work, we end up being product owners, right?

1007
00:52:01,516 --> 00:52:05,319
So we're tasked with leading multidisciplinary teams

1008
00:52:05,379 --> 00:52:06,660
that are more feature-focused.

1009
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,643
So I was wondering if you have any insight or best practices

1010
00:52:10,743 --> 00:52:12,705
or experience that you can share regarding

1011
00:52:13,105 --> 00:52:14,646
leading multidisciplinary teams.

1012
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:19,825
Right, so the question is what to do if you're not just responsible for like a small or like

1013
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:23,150
a group of programmers or artists, but like actually for an entire umbrella of people.

1014
00:52:24,972 --> 00:52:29,579
To be quite honest with you, my own experience has mostly been focused on leading programmers.

1015
00:52:31,542 --> 00:52:32,002
But I think...

1016
00:52:33,593 --> 00:52:40,276
especially the situation. I think what I would do in a situation is to make sure to talk

1017
00:52:40,516 --> 00:52:45,137
all of the kind of the people on in this team to kind of get their opinion on things so

1018
00:52:45,157 --> 00:52:50,119
you know if the senior designers saw the so whatever to make sure to get us to list solicit

1019
00:52:50,179 --> 00:52:53,780
a feedback, especially about topics that you're not sure about yourself and that you actually

1020
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:58,781
have any specific example experience was just like this the other answer, you know, you

1021
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,942
know bring this up in the open say like you I.

1022
00:53:01,442 --> 00:53:03,704
And I know that I, you know, I'm a programmer, you know,

1023
00:53:03,764 --> 00:53:05,185
now I'm in charge of artists as well.

1024
00:53:05,545 --> 00:53:06,886
This is something I'm not really,

1025
00:53:07,306 --> 00:53:08,767
I don't have any experience in.

1026
00:53:09,488 --> 00:53:11,269
But I, you know, I will try to do my best.

1027
00:53:11,369 --> 00:53:13,231
And, you know, I do want to learn from you guys.

1028
00:53:13,251 --> 00:53:15,772
I do want to learn how you approach the situation.

1029
00:53:15,872 --> 00:53:19,235
So, I don't know, I don't think I can give you

1030
00:53:19,275 --> 00:53:20,876
more like specific practical advice,

1031
00:53:20,916 --> 00:53:21,977
unfortunately, in this regard.

1032
00:53:21,997 --> 00:53:23,237
Okay, thank you.

1033
00:53:23,277 --> 00:53:23,658
You're welcome.

1034
00:53:24,516 --> 00:53:39,405
Hello. My question was sort of making the transition from peer to lead with when you're sort of faced with a group that still feels you as the peer, sort of what it's a rocky transition.

1035
00:53:40,225 --> 00:53:43,627
And you have the group that's refusing the one-on-ones,

1036
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:46,689
refusing to participate in the things you're

1037
00:53:46,729 --> 00:53:49,650
sort of instituting, and how you sort of repair

1038
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:53,152
the relationship, or even in an upcoming project,

1039
00:53:53,192 --> 00:53:56,374
just making sure things are smooth going forward.

1040
00:53:57,034 --> 00:54:02,437
So the question is, when you adjusted this role,

1041
00:54:02,577 --> 00:54:05,058
and people that you now support.

1042
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:10,746
Your teammates that you're supposedly responsible for don't recognize you as the leader, essentially, right?

1043
00:54:10,826 --> 00:54:12,709
Or see you as a peer, right?

1044
00:54:12,909 --> 00:54:15,173
Yeah, continue to see you as a peer.

1045
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:15,713
Yeah.

1046
00:54:18,563 --> 00:54:22,765
Well, I think this is actually really hard situation.

1047
00:54:22,865 --> 00:54:25,986
I talked to some people who really had problems with that,

1048
00:54:26,026 --> 00:54:28,106
because also, you know, like friendships

1049
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:29,487
were really put under stress.

1050
00:54:29,547 --> 00:54:32,268
Because now you're kind of a different angle,

1051
00:54:32,288 --> 00:54:35,209
and maybe you have to make decisions that somebody else

1052
00:54:35,269 --> 00:54:39,210
might not feel are the right way of doing things.

1053
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:40,950
So it's hard, and I think.

1054
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:48,292
I feel like really weird giving the same answer 3 times,

1055
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:51,336
but I think it's really important for these things

1056
00:54:51,356 --> 00:54:52,658
that usually go unspoken.

1057
00:54:53,078 --> 00:54:54,600
You know, that kind of stuff that you're like,

1058
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,464
this is so awkward, but I don't really know what to know.

1059
00:54:57,984 --> 00:55:00,427
I think it's important to, OK, 5 more minutes.

1060
00:55:00,487 --> 00:55:01,008
OK, awesome.

1061
00:55:01,028 --> 00:55:01,268
Thank you.

1062
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:04,332
It's important to bring this up and say.

1063
00:55:05,361 --> 00:55:09,084
have a you know have a one-on-one meeting or you know whatever catch them on the way to the coffee shop

1064
00:55:09,104 --> 00:55:15,889
it's like you know you know I noticed that you don't want to do the one-on-ones or the way you communicate with me

1065
00:55:15,949 --> 00:55:21,694
maybe it's not in the same way or how you should communicate with the lead and I realize you know we used to be peers

1066
00:55:22,294 --> 00:55:28,179
and this is really hard and I'm adjusting to this but I would really appreciate if you know you could you could help me with this and like just

1067
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:33,582
make sure that this person understands that which position you are in and you know sometimes

1068
00:55:35,063 --> 00:55:39,846
even for the people that you're responsible for that's also kind of a weird thing to adjust to.

1069
00:55:41,006 --> 00:55:46,209
So maybe I should just give the generalized answer is make sure for everything that's unspoken you

1070
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:49,351
know do make sure to bring this up and that's hard I mean this is not an easy thing to do and

1071
00:55:49,391 --> 00:55:54,094
it's very uncomfortable very often but I think you will feel much better about it afterwards and

1072
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:57,976
I think honestly that's the best thing you can do in the situation.

1073
00:55:58,734 --> 00:55:58,994
Thanks.

1074
00:55:59,054 --> 00:55:59,716
You're welcome.

1075
00:55:59,736 --> 00:56:01,259
Hi.

1076
00:56:02,162 --> 00:56:08,345
Fantastic presentation. Thank you for that. So when a lot of us that are in a lead position are

1077
00:56:08,926 --> 00:56:12,928
likely experts or past, you know, have had a lot of experience in our field doing a particular

1078
00:56:12,968 --> 00:56:17,871
job that we might now be responsible for other people doing. So when we are bringing someone

1079
00:56:17,891 --> 00:56:21,093
in that position, we'll want to train them, show them the tools and the things they need to

1080
00:56:21,113 --> 00:56:26,916
know. But there's a point at which I think we each have our personal processes, right, and

1081
00:56:26,976 --> 00:56:29,798
how we do it and what worked really well for us.

1082
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:41,047
And I think there can be a point where, I guess the question is, is there a point at which we can be too, we can try and push our own processes on someone else too much?

1083
00:56:41,447 --> 00:56:48,833
And then also, how do I identify that point where, what do our employees need to know to do what they need to do?

1084
00:56:48,933 --> 00:56:55,458
Because my curiosity now is like whether to take an approach of, alright, here's what you're responsible for.

1085
00:56:56,803 --> 00:56:59,005
go for it, you know, and kind of let them figure it out.

1086
00:56:59,065 --> 00:56:59,525
Right, right.

1087
00:56:59,986 --> 00:57:02,708
So the question is, like once you're

1088
00:57:03,148 --> 00:57:04,289
kind of writing up the hierarchy,

1089
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:07,851
you get to a point where your own kind of process

1090
00:57:09,553 --> 00:57:11,394
is so used to this that you perhaps

1091
00:57:11,994 --> 00:57:13,756
don't realize that there are other better

1092
00:57:13,776 --> 00:57:14,476
ways of doing things.

1093
00:57:14,536 --> 00:57:16,718
And like, when do you get to this point,

1094
00:57:16,738 --> 00:57:18,519
and how do you realize that, and how do you perhaps

1095
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:18,959
deal with this?

1096
00:57:18,979 --> 00:57:20,961
Is this about, right, like a summary?

1097
00:57:21,321 --> 00:57:21,881
Yeah, yeah.

1098
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:24,123
I want to know when to not have to tell someone

1099
00:57:24,143 --> 00:57:25,304
how exactly I might do it.

1100
00:57:26,224 --> 00:57:26,465
Yeah.

1101
00:57:26,989 --> 00:57:31,753
And, well, I think this will definitely happen.

1102
00:57:31,974 --> 00:57:36,338
And it kind of depends, I think, sometimes on your team size also.

1103
00:57:37,299 --> 00:57:38,901
Ideally, if you have, let's say.

1104
00:57:40,608 --> 00:57:43,629
let's say you're leading some kind of tools team and at some point you were to

1105
00:57:43,649 --> 00:57:48,051
for himself and but now you have people and you I think it's ideally would keep

1106
00:57:48,111 --> 00:57:51,012
the people actually working with on a day-to-day basis involved as well so if

1107
00:57:51,032 --> 00:57:56,215
you have someone in your team. It's like a senior programmer make sure to bring

1108
00:57:56,255 --> 00:57:59,976
him along and like also solicit is a question like so you know the way we

1109
00:57:59,996 --> 00:58:04,258
doing around right now this is make sense or for me my own experience with

1110
00:58:04,278 --> 00:58:05,619
this perhaps the closest to that is.

1111
00:58:06,645 --> 00:58:09,266
Sometimes, at least in my own experience,

1112
00:58:09,947 --> 00:58:12,708
when tools specifically don't work very well,

1113
00:58:13,048 --> 00:58:15,189
but artists are sometimes too shy to bring this up,

1114
00:58:15,349 --> 00:58:17,711
it can be hard to get to know this point.

1115
00:58:18,371 --> 00:58:20,312
And sometimes it just takes.

1116
00:58:22,808 --> 00:58:26,333
you to go around and kind of realize and I was like, wait, what's going on and then

1117
00:58:26,453 --> 00:58:30,319
like talk about the specific situation like, you know, I notice you doing it this way,

1118
00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:33,904
why are you doing this way, what is, you know, is there something that's broken with this

1119
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:37,509
process and I'm just trying to be sensitive. I think as soon as you start actually being

1120
00:58:37,549 --> 00:58:39,411
kind of sensitive to this topic and kind of.

1121
00:58:40,152 --> 00:58:43,434
take a step back like want to think about it. I think it will already change a

1122
00:58:43,474 --> 00:58:47,395
perspective on it. And then you know as I said generally like make sure to kind of

1123
00:58:47,435 --> 00:58:50,756
keep people in a team involved like people actually working the specific

1124
00:58:51,337 --> 00:58:55,798
aspects you know make sure to ask their opinion as well and even you know even

1125
00:58:55,838 --> 00:58:59,240
if it's if you make a decision otherwise they don't it's it's good to have this

1126
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,081
information anyway.

1127
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:04,622
About now? Yeah, I appreciate it. Thank you.

1128
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:12,772
Hi. So I recently started taking up some leadership responsibilities on my job, really recently.

1129
00:59:13,213 --> 00:59:17,955
So one of the things that I struggle with, that I find really hard, is when I'm put on the spot to

1130
00:59:17,995 --> 00:59:23,919
make a call, the decision making, because I can't help having in the back of my mind this, what if

1131
00:59:23,959 --> 00:59:28,702
you make the wrong choice and one of your superiors calls that out and say, oh actually we don't do

1132
00:59:28,722 --> 00:59:30,443
that, that way we're going to do the opposite.

1133
00:59:31,243 --> 00:59:34,726
So this kind of anxiety or this kind of, you know, when I have to make a call

1134
00:59:35,787 --> 00:59:40,231
I guess it's just feel fear of failure or you know, it's post syndrome or something like that

1135
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:42,213
Do you have any advice for this kind of situation?

1136
00:59:42,554 --> 00:59:44,896
So the question is that, you know, while

1137
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:49,122
decision-making process happening, you're kind of handing off some of these kind of

1138
00:59:49,142 --> 00:59:53,748
decision-making parts to your peers, but you kind of want to, you feel like, oh, you know,

1139
00:59:53,768 --> 00:59:55,971
maybe this person will make the wrong choice.

1140
00:59:55,991 --> 00:59:59,435
Is that about kind of like how do you deal with this?

1141
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:01,518
Yeah, kind of also from the point of view of...

1142
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:06,831
still feeling I guess it's the opposite of the previous question where I still feel kind of appear

1143
01:00:07,091 --> 01:00:10,973
myself so I feel like I want someone else to verify that what I'm doing is cool.

1144
01:00:11,113 --> 01:00:15,715
Okay, right. Okay, so first of all this will be the let's do this and make this the last

1145
01:00:15,755 --> 01:00:19,936
question like with the microphone and if people still want to talk to me I will be around.

1146
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:23,671
Yes, this is a really hard thing.

1147
01:00:23,731 --> 01:00:25,132
I think especially as a programmer,

1148
01:00:25,152 --> 01:00:29,114
this takes a while because it's kind of hard to kind of take

1149
01:00:29,134 --> 01:00:32,036
your hands off the keyboard and say, OK, let's you guys do it.

1150
01:00:32,256 --> 01:00:34,017
I don't, you know, I trust you.

1151
01:00:35,307 --> 01:00:38,308
It's not, I mean, the thing is, I think just the problem

1152
01:00:38,348 --> 01:00:41,869
of feeling like maybe somebody will make the wrong choice.

1153
01:00:43,049 --> 01:00:45,009
You can get around this by making sure

1154
01:00:45,069 --> 01:00:47,310
to talk to the people who actually work on this

1155
01:00:47,590 --> 01:00:48,290
pretty frequently.

1156
01:00:48,330 --> 01:00:52,011
And kind of like, don't do it in a way where you say,

1157
01:00:52,631 --> 01:00:53,891
don't do it like this, don't do it like that.

1158
01:00:53,971 --> 01:00:56,332
But kind of just asking, like, hey, what are you doing?

1159
01:00:57,412 --> 01:00:58,092
What's your approach?

1160
01:00:58,393 --> 01:01:01,033
And then try to take the statements

1161
01:01:01,253 --> 01:01:03,054
or the recommendations that you have

1162
01:01:03,134 --> 01:01:04,874
and try to put them into questions.

1163
01:01:05,634 --> 01:01:10,096
So you would say, oh, well, OK, that's interesting.

1164
01:01:10,136 --> 01:01:11,456
But have you thought about this?

1165
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,757
Try to guide them in a way.

1166
01:01:13,857 --> 01:01:16,098
And if you do this right, it takes a bit, I think,

1167
01:01:16,118 --> 01:01:16,578
to get used to.

1168
01:01:16,598 --> 01:01:18,098
But if you do this right, you will actually

1169
01:01:18,638 --> 01:01:21,119
make people feel like they arrived at this conclusion

1170
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:24,040
completely on their own terms, which is great.

1171
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:24,960
This is where you want to be.

1172
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,441
The people feel really empowered.

1173
01:01:27,081 --> 01:01:28,641
But you can also feel really proud,

1174
01:01:28,661 --> 01:01:30,402
because you helped them to get there.

1175
01:01:30,822 --> 01:01:33,823
So I think trying to just communicate

1176
01:01:34,964 --> 01:01:36,525
you know, try to find out what's going on.

1177
01:01:36,545 --> 01:01:37,746
And then if something is happening,

1178
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:40,408
first try to be nice and ask questions.

1179
01:01:40,829 --> 01:01:42,510
And if something is really obviously

1180
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,792
going the wrong direction, then you may have to say,

1181
01:01:44,812 --> 01:01:45,493
like, oh, you know what?

1182
01:01:45,773 --> 01:01:46,694
I don't think we should do like that.

1183
01:01:46,774 --> 01:01:48,796
We should do like this because of this and that and this.

1184
01:01:48,916 --> 01:01:51,558
So try to obviously use your experience

1185
01:01:52,379 --> 01:01:53,500
that you have in this field.

1186
01:01:55,402 --> 01:01:55,722
OK, thanks.

1187
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:56,102
Yep.

1188
01:01:57,023 --> 01:01:58,184
That doesn't sound dissatisfied.

1189
01:01:58,865 --> 01:02:00,286
Maybe we should talk afterwards or something.
