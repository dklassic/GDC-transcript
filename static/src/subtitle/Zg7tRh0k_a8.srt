1
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,359
My name is Mike Rose.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,803
I am from publishing label No More Robots.

3
00:00:11,884 --> 00:00:12,965
Thank you very much for coming.

4
00:00:13,025 --> 00:00:17,088
I appreciate the Google keynote is on right now.

5
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,511
So I'm very happy.

6
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:21,152
I was like, no one's gonna turn up to this,

7
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:22,533
but you have, that's really nice of you.

8
00:00:22,553 --> 00:00:23,034
Thank you very much.

9
00:00:24,856 --> 00:00:30,961
So yeah, today as part of the game discoverability day,

10
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:35,966
I'm going to be talking about how I do community stuff,

11
00:00:35,986 --> 00:00:38,088
because a lot of the stuff that I do at No More Robots

12
00:00:38,828 --> 00:00:40,750
is very community-based now.

13
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:43,813
And I'm gonna be talking a whole bunch

14
00:00:43,873 --> 00:00:45,935
about Discord as well, and you're gonna think that.

15
00:00:46,575 --> 00:00:52,478
I'm some kind of Discord shill, and I basically kind of am at this point, but it's very useful all the same.

16
00:00:53,338 --> 00:00:59,460
So, at any one time, there is always this big thing that helps sell video games, right?

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,701
So years ago, it used to be people were saying,

18
00:01:02,781 --> 00:01:05,202
you've got to get press, you've got to get all the press to talk about your games.

19
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:08,406
and then people were saying,

20
00:01:08,426 --> 00:01:10,788
no, no, get the YouTubers, the YouTubers,

21
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:12,189
get PewDiePie to play your game,

22
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:13,930
and you'll make a bunch of money.

23
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:15,311
And then it was Twitch streamers.

24
00:01:16,773 --> 00:01:18,334
And at this point,

25
00:01:18,854 --> 00:01:20,615
all of these things are still pretty useful.

26
00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:22,317
You know, you still want to be getting press

27
00:01:22,497 --> 00:01:24,338
and YouTubers and Twitch streamers playing your game.

28
00:01:24,758 --> 00:01:27,240
But really, at the moment,

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,002
the thing, at least from my perspective,

30
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:32,244
and it seems like from a lot of other people

31
00:01:32,264 --> 00:01:33,245
are realizing this as well,

32
00:01:33,625 --> 00:01:34,986
is that community building,

33
00:01:36,147 --> 00:01:40,290
is the thing that's really driving players to buy your game right now.

34
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,791
Community building always has been.

35
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:46,354
You know, over the years, there's always been forums and,

36
00:01:47,215 --> 00:01:48,635
I guess, IRC before then.

37
00:01:48,655 --> 00:01:53,399
There's always been a lot of games that have had massive buzz around them.

38
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,881
A lot of the time, they have had a nice community presence.

39
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,712
Right now, I believe that community building

40
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:05,194
has sort of become the number one thing

41
00:02:05,234 --> 00:02:07,055
that you want to be pushing for with your game

42
00:02:07,215 --> 00:02:08,015
when you're trying to sell it.

43
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:10,877
So I'm going to talk a bunch about that.

44
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:14,859
Yeah, so I'm Mike Rose.

45
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:18,841
I was originally a writer.

46
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:20,221
I used to write about video games.

47
00:02:21,222 --> 00:02:22,603
And then I sort of jumped the fence.

48
00:02:22,623 --> 00:02:25,164
And I worked for a publisher called TinyBuild for a while.

49
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:29,555
We did a bunch of games, and then because I'm an egotistical maniac, I was like,

50
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:30,715
I can do this myself.

51
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,337
So a couple years ago, I started No More Robots.

52
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:37,159
It's gone all right.

53
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:39,640
We've had some pretty nice releases.

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,743
We had a mountain biking game called Descenders, which did quite well for us.

55
00:02:44,163 --> 00:02:49,306
Last year, I put out a Brexit management game called Not Tonight.

56
00:02:50,026 --> 00:02:51,566
That went down really well on the internet.

57
00:02:52,527 --> 00:02:54,447
No, and weirdly, that one did really well.

58
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:59,508
And then last week, we just put out Hypnospace Outlaw,

59
00:02:59,869 --> 00:03:01,829
which is a 90s internet simulator.

60
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,270
And that's done quite well as well.

61
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,910
We've got a game called Family Man coming up.

62
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,071
We've got a few other games in the pipeline as well.

63
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:13,592
But yeah, that has been the stress of my life

64
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:15,893
for the last couple of years, and will continue to be so.

65
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:25,593
So, the thing I should say is that there's loads of talks about community building and

66
00:03:25,613 --> 00:03:26,233
stuff like that, right?

67
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:29,455
You can find a load of them even just on the GDC vault.

68
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:34,857
I specifically today want to talk about how you actually start it in the first place.

69
00:03:34,877 --> 00:03:37,259
Because I think a lot of people struggle with that bit.

70
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:40,740
There's loads of stuff online where it's like, here's what you do with your community.

71
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,701
You've got this community.

72
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:43,522
But no one seems to ever talk about...

73
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:46,204
I've got zero people interested right now,

74
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,266
how do I make that number be bigger than zero?

75
00:03:49,087 --> 00:03:51,228
And it's actually...

76
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,140
from my perspective, when you know what you're doing,

77
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,861
it actually is kind of simple.

78
00:03:56,281 --> 00:04:00,382
There's some steps that I follow to make this happen.

79
00:04:01,262 --> 00:04:04,923
So what I'm going to do is, instead of just being vague

80
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:06,143
and dancing around the subject, I'm

81
00:04:06,183 --> 00:04:10,004
just going to straight tell you the step-by-step thing

82
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:11,164
that I do with every game.

83
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:13,365
I'm announcing a new game in about three weeks.

84
00:04:13,825 --> 00:04:16,825
And this checklist, this step-by-step guide,

85
00:04:17,205 --> 00:04:20,646
is literally what I am going to follow just

86
00:04:20,746 --> 00:04:21,827
before we announce this game.

87
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:25,367
So if you follow this, then you can essentially

88
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:27,408
just do the stuff I do, and you don't need

89
00:04:27,428 --> 00:04:29,028
a publisher anymore.

90
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:32,969
I won't be talking about stuff like

91
00:04:33,589 --> 00:04:36,030
moderating communities, et cetera,

92
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:39,631
because again, I think there's already a ton of talks

93
00:04:39,671 --> 00:04:41,831
on this kind of thing, you know, toxicity, et cetera.

94
00:04:43,071 --> 00:04:44,512
But yeah, there's already plenty of people

95
00:04:44,532 --> 00:04:46,212
who have talked about this, who quite frankly

96
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:47,912
can probably talk about it better than me as well.

97
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:50,393
So yeah, like I say, this is gonna be

98
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:51,753
just a straightforward.

99
00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:53,844
here's what I do and you can do it too.

100
00:04:55,586 --> 00:05:00,671
These are the things that I use when I am building communities.

101
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,893
So Discord, I'll talk about that in a second.

102
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:04,794
It's all there.

103
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:06,656
I mean, you can see here there's nothing where it's like,

104
00:05:06,696 --> 00:05:08,017
that's crazy, he's using that.

105
00:05:09,138 --> 00:05:11,841
Google Forms, MailChimp, Steamworks,

106
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:17,165
it's all stuff that I imagine if you've at least even worked in games a little bit,

107
00:05:17,185 --> 00:05:18,767
you've probably used these things.

108
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,430
There's no like crazy...

109
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,871
magic program that I'm using.

110
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:29,573
I use all the obvious things.

111
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:34,035
So, Discord, the reason that I do all my community building

112
00:05:34,055 --> 00:05:38,638
through Discord is because what has happened with Discord

113
00:05:38,658 --> 00:05:40,238
is it kind of came out of nowhere, right?

114
00:05:40,638 --> 00:05:41,799
It just started building a building.

115
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:43,600
I think in, I think between like 2017 and 2018,

116
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:51,789
they had something crazy like 120 million extra people sign up to it.

117
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:59,921
And I think they say right now that they have like 10 million active people who are using Discord on a daily basis.

118
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:07,261
The reason why that is amazing compared to other possible platforms that you might think of using

119
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:13,708
is that if somebody has signed up to Discord, there is a high chance that they like video games.

120
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:15,591
It's a video game platform.

121
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:20,777
So you already know that anybody who is on Discord is...

122
00:06:21,318 --> 00:06:24,138
probably a potential person who might want to

123
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,439
buy and play your games.

124
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,979
The other thing with Discord as well is that

125
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,260
if somebody signs up for your server in the first place,

126
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,261
so, you know, for anybody who's not aware of how it works,

127
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:36,441
there's, you can get a link essentially,

128
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:39,342
and someone clicks this link, and they join your server.

129
00:06:40,302 --> 00:06:42,783
If somebody has clicked the link for your server,

130
00:06:43,223 --> 00:06:44,943
then already they've shown

131
00:06:44,963 --> 00:06:47,684
that they are interested in following your game,

132
00:06:47,744 --> 00:06:49,544
just by joining your server in the first place.

133
00:06:49,684 --> 00:06:50,885
So, it's like...

134
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:54,066
you'll have this server that you're filling up with people,

135
00:06:54,086 --> 00:06:57,446
and they are all people who have already specifically,

136
00:06:57,486 --> 00:06:59,367
by clicking that link, told you,

137
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:00,967
I am interested in your game.

138
00:07:01,628 --> 00:07:04,589
So they all become like potential customers, you know,

139
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:06,789
and if you get thousands and thousands of people

140
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,870
to join your server, then obviously that's pretty nice.

141
00:07:11,636 --> 00:07:14,819
The other thing with Discord as well is that there's just loads of cool stuff you can do

142
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:17,041
with it that I think a lot of people aren't aware of.

143
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:20,784
There's all of these sort of, like, you can just run bots and scripts in there.

144
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:26,889
You don't even need to know any coding whatsoever, quite frankly.

145
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:32,474
There's thousands of people who have already made bots that you just install in your server

146
00:07:32,814 --> 00:07:36,778
that will just do cool stuff for you and will automate whole systems for you.

147
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:42,442
I'll be talking about what I use some of the bots for later,

148
00:07:43,222 --> 00:07:48,266
but the overall is that Discord is just a really, really good place

149
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:51,388
to be collecting people who are interested in your game right now.

150
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,541
So yeah, let's just do this step by step.

151
00:07:57,062 --> 00:07:59,803
Discord, one thing to do if you're looking at this

152
00:07:59,863 --> 00:08:01,224
and you're thinking, I don't even understand

153
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:02,025
what Discord is.

154
00:08:03,466 --> 00:08:09,049
I mean, it's, I guess if you're sort of under 35,

155
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:11,070
it's Skype, except it works.

156
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,352
If you're over 35, it's just a glorified IRC.

157
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:19,476
It's literally just chat rooms where people can hang out.

158
00:08:19,536 --> 00:08:21,117
You can create a server, so you can see,

159
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:25,081
this here is the server for Descenders,

160
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:27,222
and you can see all down the left

161
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,304
is just all the different channels people can join.

162
00:08:29,765 --> 00:08:32,147
In the middle is just where they can chat to each other.

163
00:08:32,187 --> 00:08:33,388
On the right is all the users.

164
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,309
It's very simple.

165
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:37,931
If you don't, if you're still a bit like,

166
00:08:38,011 --> 00:08:39,693
I don't completely understand Discord,

167
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:40,493
go and read about it.

168
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:42,996
Honestly, it's an incredibly simple platform,

169
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:43,896
and you'll get it in no time.

170
00:08:45,432 --> 00:08:47,774
So here is how I set up servers.

171
00:08:47,835 --> 00:08:51,438
So first off, make a server, give it a name.

172
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,902
Once you've done that, you go get it verified by Discord.

173
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:59,147
Discord will verify any server.

174
00:09:00,849 --> 00:09:03,551
from a developer or publisher who is making a game.

175
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:06,233
So you go to this link, you enter all the details of the server,

176
00:09:06,573 --> 00:09:07,754
explain to them what the game is.

177
00:09:08,495 --> 00:09:12,879
Getting the server verified is incredibly useful,

178
00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:15,761
not just because it makes it look more legit to players

179
00:09:15,941 --> 00:09:19,684
and makes it so that they're possibly more likely to join.

180
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,826
But you also get a bunch of other benefits as well.

181
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:25,267
You can get a custom URL for it, so, you know,

182
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:29,149
discord.gg slash descenders, discord.gg slash hypnospace.

183
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:31,910
It's a lot easier to link that than, you know,

184
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,892
discord.gg slash invite slash a bunch of letters.

185
00:09:35,812 --> 00:09:37,793
It's just easier for people to remember it,

186
00:09:37,813 --> 00:09:39,494
and they're just far more likely to click it.

187
00:09:41,635 --> 00:09:44,616
And they just actually added this new feature,

188
00:09:44,656 --> 00:09:48,037
which is rather nice, where they now have

189
00:09:48,897 --> 00:09:51,878
just a public catalog of all of the verified servers

190
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,339
on Discord, so people, users can now actually

191
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:57,480
just look through all the verified servers.

192
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,781
I think there's only like a few hundred of them right now

193
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:01,901
that are actually verified.

194
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:05,102
So if you have a verified server right now,

195
00:10:05,142 --> 00:10:07,223
obviously you, you know, you.

196
00:10:07,623 --> 00:10:09,424
you get a nice little bit of visibility from that,

197
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:11,965
from people who might actually be interested in your game.

198
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:17,547
So the first thing is just setting up

199
00:10:17,987 --> 00:10:20,208
the bog standard channels that I think

200
00:10:20,348 --> 00:10:22,529
should be in every single Discord server.

201
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:27,110
So I see some people have a Welcome and a Rules channel.

202
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,451
I mix them into one, literally just a channel that it.

203
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:33,514
it kind of throws people into in the first place,

204
00:10:33,835 --> 00:10:35,896
where they can see all information about the game,

205
00:10:36,016 --> 00:10:37,116
they know how to behave.

206
00:10:38,177 --> 00:10:39,237
An announcements channel,

207
00:10:39,657 --> 00:10:43,159
this is where only you are gonna be talking in that one,

208
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:45,080
and that's the one where you're going to be

209
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,380
notifying people.

210
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,422
This is gonna be incredibly important later.

211
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:52,243
There's a thing in Discord called At Everyone,

212
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:54,704
where if the admin, if the person who owns the server

213
00:10:54,744 --> 00:10:55,844
types At Everyone,

214
00:10:56,485 --> 00:11:00,168
it pings every single person who is in your server,

215
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:03,450
it throws a notification onto their phone,

216
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:05,672
straight onto the home screen of their phone,

217
00:11:05,712 --> 00:11:06,933
telling them you've been pinged.

218
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:10,156
Again, imagine how useful that is

219
00:11:10,216 --> 00:11:13,439
if you've got 5,000, 10,000 people in your Discord server

220
00:11:13,459 --> 00:11:14,519
who are interested in your game,

221
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,343
and you can now directly just throw a notification

222
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:19,283
onto their phone about a thing.

223
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:23,903
And then I usually have a channel,

224
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:25,623
so you see there's one called Descendants here,

225
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,485
I usually, that's the place where people just talk,

226
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:31,386
it's just the base place where everyone's talking,

227
00:11:31,406 --> 00:11:32,626
just named after your own game.

228
00:11:33,087 --> 00:11:35,027
You'll have like a mod channel as well,

229
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:38,229
because when you first open the floodgates

230
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:42,911
of your Discord server, then it'll get kind of crazy.

231
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:45,252
But the first time with the Descendants Discord,

232
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:46,052
the first time I did it,

233
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,233
I did not completely understand Discord at this point.

234
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,353
And I remember the day I opened it,

235
00:11:51,413 --> 00:11:53,134
and thousands of people started flooding in.

236
00:11:53,654 --> 00:11:55,474
And it was chaos.

237
00:11:55,774 --> 00:11:57,335
And that will happen to you as well,

238
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:59,715
and you will be so scared.

239
00:12:00,115 --> 00:12:01,536
Because the first time you do it,

240
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:03,216
you just have no idea what it's going to be like.

241
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:04,696
There's just people,

242
00:12:05,177 --> 00:12:07,217
people will find ways to abuse your server

243
00:12:07,237 --> 00:12:08,957
in ways that you couldn't think was possible,

244
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:10,918
using commands that you didn't know existed.

245
00:12:12,378 --> 00:12:14,099
There was, on the day that I launched

246
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:15,539
the Descenders Discord.

247
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:19,999
I'd accidentally made it so that people could use a command to make

248
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:24,141
just sort of like a Microsoft voice read everything in the server

249
00:12:24,181 --> 00:12:25,782
to everybody who was in the server.

250
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:28,823
So all of a sudden there was just hundreds of people

251
00:12:29,423 --> 00:12:32,245
just screaming because there was a voice on their computer talking to them.

252
00:12:32,905 --> 00:12:33,645
That was horrible.

253
00:12:34,566 --> 00:12:35,306
And it will happen to you.

254
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:38,748
Everybody who first uses Discord will be like...

255
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:40,736
I don't understand the permissions or anything.

256
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:45,699
I think it's good to learn by failing a little bit on this.

257
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:48,961
But there's plenty of documentation you can read as well

258
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:50,882
on Discord to make sure it doesn't happen.

259
00:12:51,802 --> 00:12:54,564
But yeah, from my perspective,

260
00:12:54,604 --> 00:12:56,885
these are the kind of bog standard channels

261
00:12:56,945 --> 00:12:59,786
I will always put into every server that I run.

262
00:13:01,703 --> 00:13:04,924
What I will then have is what I call entry point channels.

263
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:09,585
And these are interesting because what they do is,

264
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:14,066
I believe, they force people who are joining your Discord

265
00:13:14,106 --> 00:13:17,267
server to engage a little bit more.

266
00:13:17,327 --> 00:13:21,688
They add an extra level of, I'm forcing you to do a thing

267
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:24,528
to be able to use my Discord server.

268
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:27,451
So right now you can see all the channels there,

269
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:29,574
but that's because I'm an admin,

270
00:13:29,594 --> 00:13:30,655
so I get to see all the channels.

271
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:33,058
What will normally happen is when someone joins

272
00:13:33,118 --> 00:13:36,722
the Descenders server, all they will be able to see

273
00:13:36,962 --> 00:13:38,704
is the pick a side channel, and that's it.

274
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:40,286
Well, the welcome channel as well,

275
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:41,908
but just below it, pick a side.

276
00:13:42,329 --> 00:13:44,031
They go into the pick a side channel.

277
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:50,243
And it says, it tells them that they need to enter a command to pick a team.

278
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:54,027
We've got three teams in the game, Enemy, Arboreal, and Kinetic.

279
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:59,613
And the idea is that we give them information in the welcome channel about these three teams

280
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:03,317
and say to them, you can't access the server until you've picked a team.

281
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:08,358
And once they enter a command, that pick a side channel

282
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:10,939
disappears, and the rest of the server opens up,

283
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,240
including special channels that are just for that team.

284
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,341
Also, if you look on the screen, you

285
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:17,701
can see that people have different colors.

286
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:21,182
It colors their name with the team they picked.

287
00:14:21,743 --> 00:14:28,610
So the whole point of this is that they already the moment they join the server feel like they're part of something

288
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:32,654
They have no idea what you know they've not that we did this before the game had come out

289
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:37,239
they had no idea what it even meant to pick a team, but the level of

290
00:14:38,119 --> 00:14:39,601
We essentially had people just

291
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:43,017
trash-talking each other, and bigging up their teams,

292
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:46,760
and banding together, all because their name

293
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,521
was a different color.

294
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:48,662
And it's this kind of thing.

295
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,143
If you don't have something like this,

296
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:53,366
I think it can cause people to just join a Discord server,

297
00:14:53,886 --> 00:14:54,967
and then just sort of be like,

298
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,710
oh, well, I don't see anything to do here,

299
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,390
so I'm gonna leave again.

300
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:02,918
It forces people to actually do an action,

301
00:15:03,258 --> 00:15:05,460
which then can lead them to do more actions.

302
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:08,542
Now, this stuff is really simple.

303
00:15:08,622 --> 00:15:10,743
So, there's a bot called Dino,

304
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,866
and honestly, it's just the best Discord bot.

305
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:16,587
It does a whole bunch of permissions stuff.

306
00:15:17,512 --> 00:15:20,052
This is the code, as if this is code.

307
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:23,013
This is the code I had to write just to make this work.

308
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,173
You can see all that happens is they type in

309
00:15:25,213 --> 00:15:27,994
one of these teams, it gives them that role,

310
00:15:29,334 --> 00:15:33,295
and then it just, in the specific channel for that team,

311
00:15:33,796 --> 00:15:37,076
will kind of welcome them, so that then it pings them

312
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:39,597
in that channel to show them, look what you have now.

313
00:15:39,997 --> 00:15:42,618
And it also then causes other people to say hi to them,

314
00:15:43,238 --> 00:15:44,758
because someone else has joined the channel.

315
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:50,120
It's honestly, this is as difficult as it gets

316
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,340
in terms of the sort of coding you need to do.

317
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:55,641
It's all very simple.

318
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:57,441
And just these things here,

319
00:15:58,341 --> 00:16:00,622
and then this is just the permission side of it.

320
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:02,982
So essentially all you're saying is that

321
00:16:03,483 --> 00:16:04,683
in the pick a side channel,

322
00:16:05,443 --> 00:16:09,304
if somebody is on team arboreal, enemy, or kinetic,

323
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:11,344
then make it so that they can't read

324
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,545
or send messages anymore.

325
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:14,965
So before they could, when they were in the channel.

326
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,847
they were able to see messages.

327
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,208
Once they've picked a team,

328
00:16:18,668 --> 00:16:20,550
their permissions are removed from that channel

329
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,871
and they can't see it anymore.

330
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:25,254
And then imagine with all the other channels, you flip it.

331
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:28,097
So originally they had no permissions

332
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:29,198
in all the other channels.

333
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:31,000
Then once they pick a team,

334
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,062
it gives them permissions in all the channels.

335
00:16:33,582 --> 00:16:36,024
It's that straightforward, quite frankly.

336
00:16:36,104 --> 00:16:38,466
It really doesn't take any more than that.

337
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:44,811
You can go a little bit crazier, which I'll kind of mention a little bit later with some of the idiotic things we've done,

338
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:49,214
but realistically, just doing this is enough, quite frankly.

339
00:16:50,536 --> 00:16:52,577
So once you've set up what I think,

340
00:16:52,897 --> 00:16:55,478
that's sort of the basics of setting up the Discord server,

341
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:59,380
you then want to think about what it is

342
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,721
that is keeping people in your Discord server.

343
00:17:03,181 --> 00:17:06,023
I talk a lot about thinking of the hook for your game,

344
00:17:06,623 --> 00:17:08,243
and it's kind of the same thing.

345
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:12,345
Why do people want to not only join your Discord server,

346
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,346
but stick around?

347
00:17:13,986 --> 00:17:17,427
When I did Descenders, we went for a very simple thing.

348
00:17:18,628 --> 00:17:19,428
They've picked a team.

349
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:21,630
And so they're all different colors now.

350
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:26,034
And then at this point, we started doing weekly challenges for them.

351
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:28,657
We'd say to them at the start of the week on a Monday,

352
00:17:29,117 --> 00:17:32,520
we want you to battle it out doing this thing this week.

353
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:34,582
And it was always extremely silly things.

354
00:17:34,602 --> 00:17:38,566
You know, one week it would be, we want you to do fan art for your team.

355
00:17:38,606 --> 00:17:41,409
The next week, we want you to do trash art for the other teams.

356
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,412
We want you to write haikus this week.

357
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:48,835
It's nothing crazy, it's just silly little things they can do,

358
00:17:49,355 --> 00:17:50,896
which just keep them engaged.

359
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:53,478
And you can see that all of these channels at the bottom,

360
00:17:53,518 --> 00:17:55,099
like I was saying, you know, for example,

361
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,382
team Arboreal people would only see the team Arboreal channel

362
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:01,163
using permissions.

363
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:04,966
This just... it worked really well for the Descenders

364
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:08,148
when we first announced the Descenders server,

365
00:18:08,548 --> 00:18:10,290
because as well, this approach...

366
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,723
is quite hands off.

367
00:18:12,763 --> 00:18:14,844
You know, there's not a ton that you have to do here.

368
00:18:15,184 --> 00:18:17,865
It was essentially on a Monday I'd post a challenge,

369
00:18:18,346 --> 00:18:20,507
and on a Friday I'd post the results of the challenge,

370
00:18:20,987 --> 00:18:22,847
and whichever team had won the challenge,

371
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,609
they would get things like they would get,

372
00:18:26,089 --> 00:18:27,869
we'd tell them they were gonna get a special kit

373
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,650
when the game came out.

374
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,152
You can also, you can have custom emotes in Discord,

375
00:18:33,232 --> 00:18:34,352
so we'd tell them each week.

376
00:18:35,232 --> 00:18:38,174
will give your team a custom emote for your team.

377
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:41,036
And so then they would start using those emotes

378
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:43,358
to then essentially trash the other teams.

379
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:45,940
Most of the teams just basically tried

380
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,421
to collect the letters of their names

381
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,242
so that they could then just spell them all out.

382
00:18:50,783 --> 00:18:52,364
But yeah, this worked really well.

383
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:55,686
When we came to do the Discord for Not Tonight,

384
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:59,488
Because I'm crazy, I just always want to take it a step too far.

385
00:19:00,469 --> 00:19:02,690
Or at least a step further than we did last time.

386
00:19:03,271 --> 00:19:08,354
So I tried to do some weird permission stuff

387
00:19:08,474 --> 00:19:09,955
that also kind of worked out.

388
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:13,877
So the whole point in our game Not Tonight

389
00:19:13,937 --> 00:19:15,378
is that you're a bouncer,

390
00:19:15,598 --> 00:19:17,519
and you're deciding whether to let people in or out.

391
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:26,329
I wanted to make it so that people in the Not Tonight discord could essentially go to work and earn money.

392
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:33,337
So the idea would be that they would be able to see home, they'd be able to see their home channel but nothing else.

393
00:19:34,118 --> 00:19:35,740
and then they type a command,

394
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,282
and it would open up places for them to work

395
00:19:38,523 --> 00:19:39,504
and remove their home,

396
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:43,348
and then after they decided they'd done a day's work,

397
00:19:43,408 --> 00:19:46,371
they could then type a command to go back home.

398
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:50,235
Again, it was very, very simple to set this up.

399
00:19:50,275 --> 00:19:51,416
It was just Dino again,

400
00:19:51,536 --> 00:19:52,778
so I'm literally just making it

401
00:19:52,838 --> 00:19:54,780
so that I add a role called Bouncer.

402
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,321
to them so that they can then see the channels

403
00:19:57,341 --> 00:19:59,142
which have the permissions for Bouncer.

404
00:19:59,642 --> 00:20:02,443
Then when they type in end job, it removes Bouncer

405
00:20:02,463 --> 00:20:03,903
so all of those channels disappear.

406
00:20:04,844 --> 00:20:08,625
I coupled this with a bot called Unbelievable Pizza,

407
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:11,746
which is a great name, and this is just essentially,

408
00:20:12,506 --> 00:20:15,567
it's the currency bot that I now use for all my servers

409
00:20:15,587 --> 00:20:17,188
because it's extremely useful.

410
00:20:17,588 --> 00:20:20,289
It's very, there's just so much customization

411
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:20,869
you can do to it.

412
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,488
pick the type of currency I could pick,

413
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:25,229
how fast people would get the money.

414
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:27,891
I could give them things to buy using the money.

415
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:31,533
And this came in useful later when I would tell them,

416
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:33,575
right, if you earn this much money,

417
00:20:34,115 --> 00:20:37,537
you can then buy a character in the full game,

418
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:40,219
or you can name a pub in the game.

419
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,221
Or there was like the grand prize,

420
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:44,642
which was a free copy of the game

421
00:20:44,662 --> 00:20:47,764
that people were rushing to try and win.

422
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:49,566
But again,

423
00:20:50,488 --> 00:20:51,548
Incredibly simple.

424
00:20:51,648 --> 00:20:57,149
I just installed two bots and wrote those tiny bits of code there.

425
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,570
And that sort of set up an entire server,

426
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,150
which then, the great thing about the Not Tonight server

427
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,091
was that it just worked by itself.

428
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:07,271
I didn't really have to do much to it.

429
00:21:07,611 --> 00:21:11,432
This whole currency thing was just running itself.

430
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:15,173
And so I could just walk away for weeks,

431
00:21:15,433 --> 00:21:18,433
and people would have fun playing this game that I'd set up.

432
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,560
When it came to hypnospace, I went too far.

433
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,681
Don't do this.

434
00:21:24,221 --> 00:21:27,361
I set up an entire 90s internet within a Discord server.

435
00:21:27,762 --> 00:21:30,602
I actually got a guy, yeah, it's not right.

436
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:34,743
I actually got a guy, I found a guy

437
00:21:34,763 --> 00:21:36,284
who had written a Discord bot,

438
00:21:36,324 --> 00:21:37,924
which nearly did the thing I wanted to do.

439
00:21:37,984 --> 00:21:39,164
I messaged him and I said,

440
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:40,925
here's the insane thing I'm trying to do,

441
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:42,405
and he said, I can write that for you.

442
00:21:42,905 --> 00:21:47,006
So what happens here is that someone can go

443
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,286
to the search engine channel.

444
00:21:49,847 --> 00:21:52,230
and they can see all the pages that people have made

445
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,575
and they can type a command to join the service.

446
00:21:55,595 --> 00:21:56,576
So normally what would happen is,

447
00:21:56,677 --> 00:21:58,279
again, because I'm admin, I can see all the channels.

448
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:00,121
People wouldn't be able to see all these channels

449
00:22:00,202 --> 00:22:02,825
and they'd have to search in the search engine for a page

450
00:22:02,945 --> 00:22:05,389
and join it to add it to the Discord server.

451
00:22:05,923 --> 00:22:09,925
They can then type a sort of like a exclamation mark create

452
00:22:10,305 --> 00:22:14,706
to make a web page that only they would be able to edit

453
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:16,367
and other people could join.

454
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:20,108
It was too much, quite frankly.

455
00:22:20,428 --> 00:22:22,629
It was fun and people were joining and being like,

456
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:24,330
this is the craziest thing I've ever seen.

457
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,031
I don't think you need to do this.

458
00:22:27,071 --> 00:22:29,191
I don't think this server benefited more

459
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:31,892
than the Not Tonight one did and it was way more work.

460
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,173
But you know, if you're crazy like me,

461
00:22:34,213 --> 00:22:35,713
then maybe this is something you wanna try and do.

462
00:22:38,114 --> 00:22:42,395
Okay, so at this point you've now got your Discord server all set up with all the right channels

463
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:47,896
and you've got some kind of hook for why people are going to join and then not immediately leave.

464
00:22:48,436 --> 00:22:50,577
Everything at this point is now incredibly simple.

465
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:53,077
You make a channel that is just beta sign up.

466
00:22:53,117 --> 00:22:56,638
We're doing a multiplayer beta for Descenders right now,

467
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:58,859
so this is a channel that I have live right now.

468
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:03,760
It just links to a Google form where people are just kind of signing up.

469
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,941
as simple as that, just a Google form asking them

470
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:09,201
for their name and email address.

471
00:23:10,182 --> 00:23:12,182
The idea is that they're just going to be going

472
00:23:12,262 --> 00:23:14,743
through your Discord server,

473
00:23:15,323 --> 00:23:18,504
finding the link to the Google form,

474
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:20,005
and signing up there.

475
00:23:20,085 --> 00:23:21,745
So you've now got them in two places.

476
00:23:21,785 --> 00:23:23,886
You've now got them directly,

477
00:23:23,926 --> 00:23:25,867
so you can talk to them within the Discord,

478
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:28,587
and you've now got them on a mailing list,

479
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:30,148
so you can keep them up to speed

480
00:23:30,168 --> 00:23:31,448
with what is happening to the game.

481
00:23:32,307 --> 00:23:34,487
both incredibly useful in their own way.

482
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,728
And at this point, so what I normally do is,

483
00:23:38,908 --> 00:23:40,709
I normally now link this up

484
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:42,769
with the announcement of a game.

485
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,130
So if your game is already announced,

486
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,131
then obviously you can change this up.

487
00:23:47,151 --> 00:23:48,031
But what I would normally do,

488
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:49,951
everything I've done up to now, I've done in secret,

489
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:51,712
kind of behind the scenes, not told anyone.

490
00:23:52,212 --> 00:23:55,153
And then when it comes to the announcement of the game day,

491
00:23:55,653 --> 00:23:59,494
then this is when I start spamming the link.

492
00:23:59,974 --> 00:24:03,295
for the Discord to everybody that I possibly can,

493
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:06,637
along with telling them, if you go here,

494
00:24:06,897 --> 00:24:11,218
you can sign up to play in the upcoming closed beta

495
00:24:11,238 --> 00:24:11,679
for the game.

496
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:14,080
And that's the hook for why they are coming in

497
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,900
in the first place.

498
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,121
I see people sort of, they announce a game

499
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:19,562
or they just make a Discord for their game.

500
00:24:20,902 --> 00:24:23,485
and they just sort of say,

501
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,347
hey, people, join my Discord

502
00:24:25,387 --> 00:24:27,388
so you can keep up to speed with my game.

503
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:30,371
And unfortunately, the vast majority of players

504
00:24:30,531 --> 00:24:31,532
aren't going to do that.

505
00:24:31,973 --> 00:24:35,856
They won't just join a Discord server to hang out

506
00:24:35,997 --> 00:24:37,578
because they're already probably in.

507
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,641
a dozen other Discord servers.

508
00:24:41,221 --> 00:24:45,385
The whole point of timing the come here to sign up

509
00:24:45,745 --> 00:24:47,867
to be able to play an early version of the game,

510
00:24:48,307 --> 00:24:49,889
that's the reason why they come in.

511
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:51,250
And they do come in.

512
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,073
If you do this right and you sort of get the link out

513
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,554
to as many places as possible,

514
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,377
you can get thousands and thousands of people

515
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,298
to sign up to your server.

516
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:03,961
It's genuinely...

517
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:05,762
really not that hard to do.

518
00:25:06,363 --> 00:25:08,045
You know, when, before I'd done it

519
00:25:08,085 --> 00:25:09,446
and before we were gonna do Descenders,

520
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:11,068
I was wondering, I wonder how many people

521
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:12,049
are gonna sign up to this?

522
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:13,771
You know, it might not be that many,

523
00:25:13,831 --> 00:25:15,513
and I think in like two days,

524
00:25:15,553 --> 00:25:18,096
we got like 7,000 people join the server

525
00:25:18,576 --> 00:25:19,738
because they were so desperate

526
00:25:20,198 --> 00:25:21,500
to play an early build of the game.

527
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:23,221
So.

528
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:27,350
There's loads of places I've kind of listed here,

529
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,611
which are great ways to get people.

530
00:25:30,291 --> 00:25:32,512
One of the interesting ones is there's loads of sites

531
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:36,093
on the internet that are sort of like freesteamkeys.com

532
00:25:36,354 --> 00:25:39,155
and all that, where people who just want free games

533
00:25:39,315 --> 00:25:39,835
are just going.

534
00:25:40,175 --> 00:25:42,256
It seems like it's pointless to put them on there,

535
00:25:42,296 --> 00:25:42,576
because...

536
00:25:43,336 --> 00:25:45,178
You know if those people are just gonna grab your game for free

537
00:25:45,218 --> 00:25:46,139
Why would they pay for it?

538
00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:52,624
But the thing that I found is that actually is real useful because on the one hand you get a ton of people playing the

539
00:25:52,664 --> 00:25:58,408
game early and whether or not they're gonna buy it in the end the feedback is useful and

540
00:25:58,428 --> 00:25:59,109
it just

541
00:25:59,649 --> 00:26:02,592
means that it looks like there's even more buzz

542
00:26:02,772 --> 00:26:06,115
around the playing of your game

543
00:26:06,155 --> 00:26:07,956
and all of these different people playing it early.

544
00:26:08,917 --> 00:26:11,519
I've also found as well that a lot of the time,

545
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,143
these people who may not really buy games

546
00:26:15,183 --> 00:26:16,464
and are just looking for free games,

547
00:26:16,524 --> 00:26:17,565
they'll join your Discord,

548
00:26:17,585 --> 00:26:19,026
they'll see there's some cool people around.

549
00:26:19,386 --> 00:26:21,928
They'll be fascinated by the idea

550
00:26:21,968 --> 00:26:23,990
that they've just joined a server

551
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,833
and now they can talk directly to the developer.

552
00:26:27,193 --> 00:26:29,315
Because that doesn't happen very often, right?

553
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:31,977
Like, we launch a Discord server,

554
00:26:32,017 --> 00:26:34,019
and there's people who are just like,

555
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:36,201
this is so cool that I can just,

556
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,924
right directly now, talk to people who are making this game.

557
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:43,447
And that, a lot of the time, I've found converts

558
00:26:43,507 --> 00:26:46,109
a lot of people who have told me,

559
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:48,852
I just joined this just to play some free stuff,

560
00:26:49,192 --> 00:26:51,974
but I've now got so much into this

561
00:26:52,275 --> 00:26:54,757
that I'm more than happy to buy it at launch.

562
00:26:55,537 --> 00:26:57,359
So, yeah, these are all the places I do.

563
00:26:57,639 --> 00:27:01,301
Another thing you can do as well is you can talk to some of the big press sites.

564
00:27:01,862 --> 00:27:07,065
People like PC Gamer, PC Games N, and people like that

565
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:14,870
will do beta giveaways with their viewership, I guess.

566
00:27:15,951 --> 00:27:17,312
And that can be very useful as well.

567
00:27:17,332 --> 00:27:22,335
You throw 5,000 Steam keys at them, and they will bring on extra people.

568
00:27:22,575 --> 00:27:24,976
Of course, those people aren't coming into your Discord as well,

569
00:27:24,996 --> 00:27:27,336
so you're kind of missing that angle.

570
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:32,958
But again, it's pretty useful to just have more people

571
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:34,158
playing your game, quite frankly.

572
00:27:36,218 --> 00:27:38,639
And then, again, incredibly simple.

573
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:41,500
This is just the checklist of stuff that I then do

574
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,920
when I'm then running the beta.

575
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,521
What I normally do is I normally have it so that...

576
00:27:47,392 --> 00:27:50,574
We announce a game on a Discord and have people joining.

577
00:27:50,915 --> 00:27:52,175
We leave it a few weeks.

578
00:27:52,556 --> 00:27:55,478
And then a few weeks later, we then

579
00:27:55,818 --> 00:27:57,099
run the beta for the game.

580
00:27:57,959 --> 00:27:59,720
What this normally makes happen is

581
00:27:59,801 --> 00:28:04,344
that we get the boost of people joining when we announce.

582
00:28:04,444 --> 00:28:07,165
And then three weeks later, we get a second boost of people

583
00:28:07,806 --> 00:28:09,887
as we say that week, this is happening this week,

584
00:28:10,087 --> 00:28:12,029
and more people start talking about it that week.

585
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:13,410
So you kind of get a second burst.

586
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,671
But again, it's very simple.

587
00:28:16,031 --> 00:28:18,752
I normally set up a separate product on Steam,

588
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:21,254
literally just buy a second product for,

589
00:28:21,854 --> 00:28:22,795
I don't know how much it is now, 80, $100,

590
00:28:22,855 --> 00:28:23,275
something like that.

591
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:30,751
And yeah, just pick a weekend and go for it.

592
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:32,892
If you've not used MailChimp before,

593
00:28:33,433 --> 00:28:34,673
it's very simple to use.

594
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:38,195
It's literally just assign Steam keys

595
00:28:38,255 --> 00:28:40,036
for each of the email addresses

596
00:28:40,056 --> 00:28:41,537
you've been collecting through the Google form

597
00:28:41,697 --> 00:28:44,358
and email them all on the date that your beta starts.

598
00:28:44,878 --> 00:28:47,560
You want to, I've seen people when they do this,

599
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,141
say like, oh, we'll just let it run.

600
00:28:49,301 --> 00:28:50,101
Just let the beta run

601
00:28:50,141 --> 00:28:51,702
or we'll do it for a month or something.

602
00:28:52,627 --> 00:28:56,629
I think it's a good idea to have it for a very set period of time.

603
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:58,289
And I've actually done both,

604
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,671
and I've found that the very concentrated one works so much better,

605
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:05,693
because people know when they see that it's only going to happen

606
00:29:05,713 --> 00:29:09,075
between these three to five dates, they make sure to play it.

607
00:29:09,435 --> 00:29:12,336
And so you get far more, again, it's the concentrated,

608
00:29:12,436 --> 00:29:14,598
lots of people all talking about it at the same time.

609
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:17,119
So yeah, I always stick to that.

610
00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:21,040
And then again, Discord can be really useful at this point

611
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,521
for collecting bugs, essentially.

612
00:29:24,741 --> 00:29:28,122
And you could set up a channel that's just bug reporting,

613
00:29:28,182 --> 00:29:30,463
and you can have a form in there where you tell them,

614
00:29:30,503 --> 00:29:34,224
this is how we want you to provide the bugs for us.

615
00:29:34,244 --> 00:29:35,645
Because if you don't say that,

616
00:29:35,765 --> 00:29:37,185
then you can imagine what happens,

617
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:40,987
just a million people all shouting,

618
00:29:41,027 --> 00:29:42,227
this doesn't work, that doesn't work,

619
00:29:42,287 --> 00:29:44,408
and it's just not useful whatsoever, it's just noise.

620
00:29:45,328 --> 00:29:47,411
So yeah, it's good to get that kind of thing sorted.

621
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:51,195
And just another channel for, you know, suggesting features.

622
00:29:51,695 --> 00:29:53,958
Again, it's probably the case, as bad as it sounds,

623
00:29:53,978 --> 00:29:56,040
that 90% of the things people are suggesting

624
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,081
are not gonna be useful.

625
00:29:57,642 --> 00:29:59,704
But then again, if a lot of people

626
00:29:59,764 --> 00:30:01,266
keep suggesting the same thing,

627
00:30:01,286 --> 00:30:03,027
then it's probably a sign that

628
00:30:03,088 --> 00:30:04,309
that might actually be a cool thing.

629
00:30:05,743 --> 00:30:10,305
And this whole time as well, of course, you can be asking people to wishlist your game on Steam.

630
00:30:10,745 --> 00:30:14,127
Steam wishlists, if you're not aware, are incredibly useful.

631
00:30:14,207 --> 00:30:19,169
If you can get to a certain level of wishlists, it means that around the launch of your game,

632
00:30:19,209 --> 00:30:23,691
you're going to get sort of, you know, in the Steam front page lists.

633
00:30:24,843 --> 00:30:31,989
It seems right now that if you can get to about 8,000 to 10,000 Steam wishlists at launch,

634
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,854
then that will cause your game to get featured in more lists.

635
00:30:37,775 --> 00:30:40,057
So that's maybe a number you want to be aiming for.

636
00:30:40,978 --> 00:30:43,540
But when you do this beta stuff through Discord,

637
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,563
this is a time when you will see tons of people wishlisting the game,

638
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:48,905
and you really want to be pushing hard for it at this point.

639
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:54,231
So this should be where you're up to at this point.

640
00:30:55,211 --> 00:30:58,133
You've now run the beta, it's the end of the beta,

641
00:30:58,193 --> 00:31:01,314
it's now the period between you've done this public test,

642
00:31:01,574 --> 00:31:03,735
you've now got a server full of thousands of people

643
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:04,896
who are interested in your game,

644
00:31:05,356 --> 00:31:07,297
and you now gotta just make the dang thing.

645
00:31:09,452 --> 00:31:11,413
And it can be tricky at this point,

646
00:31:11,493 --> 00:31:13,935
because now you've just got a ton of people

647
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,075
who are every day saying,

648
00:31:15,135 --> 00:31:15,876
is the game out yet?

649
00:31:15,956 --> 00:31:16,676
Is the game out yet?

650
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:18,197
And it just, you know,

651
00:31:18,497 --> 00:31:20,298
well, we all know how long it takes to make games.

652
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:23,860
And so it can be tricky

653
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,401
to keep people happy at that period.

654
00:31:27,441 --> 00:31:29,222
And you might find people leaving

655
00:31:29,302 --> 00:31:31,403
because they feel like they're just sort of

656
00:31:31,944 --> 00:31:34,145
sat in a stagnant server at that point.

657
00:31:35,085 --> 00:31:35,245
So.

658
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:41,101
This point is where I sort of do the next step of what I do,

659
00:31:41,522 --> 00:31:47,332
which is that I run silly meta games for each of the games.

660
00:31:49,306 --> 00:31:54,167
The idea here is that running up to the launch of the game,

661
00:31:55,088 --> 00:31:58,609
you want to keep people in your Discord happy

662
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:02,830
by just running silly games that by the time

663
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,971
that the launch of your actual game comes,

664
00:32:06,751 --> 00:32:09,212
they have to buy your game at that point

665
00:32:09,312 --> 00:32:11,852
because they are already so invested

666
00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:14,593
in what has just happened to them

667
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:16,334
for the few months before then.

668
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:18,054
It's.

669
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,841
It really is.

670
00:32:20,101 --> 00:32:24,164
I didn't really do a metagame for Descenders as much.

671
00:32:25,184 --> 00:32:28,847
It was more we were just sort of trying to build hype

672
00:32:28,887 --> 00:32:31,169
in the server up to the launch.

673
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:33,691
And I kind of wish I had done a metagame for it

674
00:32:33,731 --> 00:32:38,074
because then I did one for Not Tonight and Hypnospace.

675
00:32:38,754 --> 00:32:41,756
And you could really see by the time the game came out.

676
00:32:42,357 --> 00:32:44,378
People that the stuff that we had done

677
00:32:45,739 --> 00:32:49,842
In in the discord had made it so that they were already hardcore

678
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:53,845
You know hypnospace fans before hypnospace had even come out

679
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:59,741
So I should probably explain better what I mean by this whole metagame thing.

680
00:33:00,182 --> 00:33:07,527
Essentially, at the very core of it, it's just doing a bunch of storytelling at people

681
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:10,489
and getting them to be involved in that storytelling.

682
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:15,212
So when we did the Not Tonight meta after we'd done the beta...

683
00:33:16,947 --> 00:33:20,988
I essentially set it up so that everybody in the server,

684
00:33:21,008 --> 00:33:24,329
they'd all picked a region when they first joined the server.

685
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:26,849
So they had to pick whether they were in the North, the South,

686
00:33:27,229 --> 00:33:28,589
or the Midlands in the UK.

687
00:33:29,229 --> 00:33:31,510
And then we had general elections

688
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,630
where everybody could vote on who

689
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:36,611
they wanted to be the Prime Minister and the MPs.

690
00:33:37,011 --> 00:33:39,731
Once we had done that, then I started giving them,

691
00:33:40,471 --> 00:33:44,172
I started giving the Prime Minister and his MPs

692
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:49,975
decisions to make each day. They started off all right at first, you know, just like who should be

693
00:33:50,035 --> 00:33:55,622
taxed and all this kind of stuff, and by the end it had got really horrible where I'd, you know,

694
00:33:55,682 --> 00:34:01,570
I was essentially doing things like I'd tell somebody, I'd tell one of the MPs that they were a spy.

695
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:03,792
and that they can't tell anyone,

696
00:34:04,152 --> 00:34:06,515
and they have to try and stay undetected for a week,

697
00:34:07,035 --> 00:34:08,056
and then midway through the week,

698
00:34:08,136 --> 00:34:10,259
I tell everybody else that there was a spy,

699
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,422
and just let, just sit back and just watch what happened,

700
00:34:13,822 --> 00:34:15,044
and you can imagine what happened.

701
00:34:15,544 --> 00:34:17,586
A lot of the meta stuff that I do, actually,

702
00:34:17,726 --> 00:34:20,169
is very inspired by just a lot of,

703
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,791
you know, sort of like the,

704
00:34:22,912 --> 00:34:25,252
a lot of board games and card games really,

705
00:34:25,593 --> 00:34:26,853
and hidden role games.

706
00:34:27,393 --> 00:34:30,274
A lot of this really works in text form,

707
00:34:30,574 --> 00:34:31,955
because you tell some people,

708
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:34,716
you tell like thousands of people some information

709
00:34:35,296 --> 00:34:37,617
that maybe is worrying information

710
00:34:37,657 --> 00:34:38,957
about the situation they're in,

711
00:34:39,217 --> 00:34:41,658
and all of a sudden they scramble together,

712
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,079
they form little,

713
00:34:43,339 --> 00:34:46,320
there was people in the Not Tonight server

714
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,141
who were making other servers

715
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:50,181
that they were only inviting people

716
00:34:50,241 --> 00:34:52,342
who they knew wasn't the spy into.

717
00:34:52,642 --> 00:34:55,703
so that they could try and work together to work out who the spy was.

718
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:58,924
This whole thing ended, we had a,

719
00:34:59,144 --> 00:35:02,185
we had a, you know I said earlier that we had a prize that was

720
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:06,447
to win a copy of the game, but it didn't just do that. Whoever got

721
00:35:06,547 --> 00:35:09,768
that prize, whoever managed to earn enough money to get that prize would become

722
00:35:09,968 --> 00:35:13,149
king or queen of the server. And I didn't tell them this

723
00:35:13,389 --> 00:35:17,090
until someone won it. So then we had to have a king's coronation

724
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:20,972
where hundreds of people all sat in voice chat

725
00:35:21,492 --> 00:35:28,381
listening to, you know, just sort of random songs of YouTube, sort of UK royalty songs,

726
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:35,671
while people like, while the Prime Minister and other people just like role-played a coronation.

727
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:40,573
They decided I was the queen, so I had to sing the national anthem.

728
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:45,534
And then I essentially made a bomb go off,

729
00:35:45,614 --> 00:35:49,074
because it ties in with the game, in Not Tonight,

730
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:52,515
it starts with a bomb going off and the whole point is that it jumps back in time,

731
00:35:52,535 --> 00:35:54,336
you have to work out how we got to this point.

732
00:35:55,276 --> 00:35:57,656
And then we had it where we locked the server down,

733
00:35:57,736 --> 00:36:00,497
it was martial law until we could work out who the bomber was.

734
00:36:01,499 --> 00:36:02,720
it got weird.

735
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:07,123
But imagine, by the time we got to the launch of the game,

736
00:36:07,824 --> 00:36:10,025
all of these people needed to buy the game at this point

737
00:36:10,106 --> 00:36:11,807
because they were already invested.

738
00:36:11,947 --> 00:36:13,809
They were already so invested.

739
00:36:14,129 --> 00:36:15,770
One of them was a king of the game.

740
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,253
We put him in the game as you could get posters

741
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:22,376
for the king and there was a picture of him on a coin

742
00:36:22,636 --> 00:36:23,256
and stuff like that.

743
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:25,478
People had to get the game at this point

744
00:36:25,738 --> 00:36:27,380
because they just had to.

745
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:31,217
So then when I came to do the Hypnospace one,

746
00:36:31,998 --> 00:36:34,040
I essentially took what I'd done

747
00:36:34,701 --> 00:36:36,242
and just tried to take it a step further.

748
00:36:36,282 --> 00:36:39,146
So there's a character in Hypnospace

749
00:36:39,226 --> 00:36:43,631
called Dylan Merchant who runs the operating system

750
00:36:44,632 --> 00:36:46,013
that you are playing in the game.

751
00:36:46,794 --> 00:36:51,581
And so I started, I made a discord account called Dylan Merchant with his face

752
00:36:52,242 --> 00:36:55,006
and I started talking to people like doing announcements like,

753
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,932
hey everybody the new Hypno S update is coming out soon

754
00:36:58,952 --> 00:37:01,636
and it all started off very nice and everyone was like, oh there's Dylan

755
00:37:01,736 --> 00:37:04,157
and guys, great!" And I keep saying to them,

756
00:37:04,397 --> 00:37:05,618
oh, what would you guys like?

757
00:37:05,638 --> 00:37:06,878
Would you like this? Would you like that?

758
00:37:06,938 --> 00:37:10,060
And then I said, would you like some monetization?

759
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,720
And I started giving them HypnoCoins,

760
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:14,942
which is the currency in the game which just means nothing,

761
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,823
which you can only spend in the game and not in real life.

762
00:37:18,563 --> 00:37:20,264
So they all started earning HypnoCoins.

763
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,626
And then it started just getting really dark.

764
00:37:24,366 --> 00:37:27,367
And we kept talking about how there was an update coming out,

765
00:37:28,168 --> 00:37:28,608
but there was...

766
00:37:29,757 --> 00:37:32,059
Some people in the press were saying there was something wrong with it.

767
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:37,824
And so maybe, so we made a Y2K enforcement team,

768
00:37:38,185 --> 00:37:40,807
who were this team of about 20 users in the server,

769
00:37:41,147 --> 00:37:45,191
who were only allowed to say nice things about Merchantsoft.

770
00:37:45,431 --> 00:37:48,033
If they saw anybody saying bad things about Merchantsoft,

771
00:37:48,053 --> 00:37:49,955
these people had to come along and crack down on it,

772
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:52,477
make sure no one was saying bad things.

773
00:37:54,494 --> 00:38:03,120
it ended up with someone, again, winning a prize in the server which made them become

774
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,703
a cyborg called the Packard who ran around with his bell.

775
00:38:09,644 --> 00:38:14,548
And then there was whistleblowers who knew that the new update on Hypno-S was going to

776
00:38:15,028 --> 00:38:18,811
sort of overheat and destroy the...

777
00:38:19,371 --> 00:38:20,793
basically the entire internet.

778
00:38:21,254 --> 00:38:22,816
We had them running around a map

779
00:38:23,116 --> 00:38:25,820
where I made up rules for a small board game

780
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,061
that they were all playing together.

781
00:38:27,081 --> 00:38:30,806
Yeah, again, it got really weird.

782
00:38:31,387 --> 00:38:33,590
And again, it just got to the point

783
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,192
where when the game came out.

784
00:38:35,653 --> 00:38:38,593
there was no way these people who had been involved

785
00:38:38,653 --> 00:38:40,274
weren't playing because they needed to see

786
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:41,734
how Dylan was in the game.

787
00:38:42,014 --> 00:38:44,134
They needed to see if this Dylan

788
00:38:44,154 --> 00:38:45,295
who they'd been talking to,

789
00:38:45,715 --> 00:38:47,695
they needed to see what that bastard was up to next.

790
00:38:47,735 --> 00:38:49,395
You know, like they had to play the game.

791
00:38:49,755 --> 00:38:51,536
And everything that I do in the meta

792
00:38:51,556 --> 00:38:53,156
then ties into the game in some way.

793
00:38:53,176 --> 00:38:58,237
So this map here is actually like a mini recreation

794
00:38:58,617 --> 00:39:00,817
of a part in the game where you're moving around a map.

795
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:02,558
So when people got up to this bit in the game,

796
00:39:02,938 --> 00:39:03,478
they were all like,

797
00:39:03,698 --> 00:39:05,879
oh man, look, it's this bit that we did in the meta,

798
00:39:05,899 --> 00:39:06,599
this is amazing.

799
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:10,240
Yeah, the whole point, the bottom line of this

800
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,761
is that by running these things,

801
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:16,702
it really builds hype in your servers

802
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:18,123
to the point where on launch day,

803
00:39:18,483 --> 00:39:20,644
you actually know your game's gonna probably do

804
00:39:20,704 --> 00:39:22,904
pretty decently because all of these people

805
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:26,225
are going to go crazy over it, which is...

806
00:39:28,184 --> 00:39:31,125
Again, obviously a massively useful thing.

807
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:33,306
If you already know on launch day

808
00:39:33,626 --> 00:39:35,067
that you've got thousands of people

809
00:39:35,367 --> 00:39:39,389
who are quite frankly going to definitely

810
00:39:39,449 --> 00:39:40,710
buy your game on launch week,

811
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,611
what more can you ask for right now?

812
00:39:43,671 --> 00:39:46,192
That's the dream, knowing your game is going to sell.

813
00:39:47,073 --> 00:39:49,114
And that's kind of the point when we get

814
00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:50,194
to the launch of one of our games,

815
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,295
we know it's going to sell at least

816
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:54,156
this sort of base level of well,

817
00:39:54,637 --> 00:39:56,357
because we already can see all of these people

818
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:56,878
are gonna buy it.

819
00:39:59,626 --> 00:40:02,648
And there's loads of other benefits as well to doing this.

820
00:40:02,828 --> 00:40:05,769
So the day your game comes out,

821
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,871
what we've found with our last few games

822
00:40:08,291 --> 00:40:12,573
is that we get a flurry of positive reviews

823
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:13,894
on our Steam page,

824
00:40:13,974 --> 00:40:16,195
because all of these people want to buy the game

825
00:40:16,475 --> 00:40:17,796
and they want to be one of the first

826
00:40:17,836 --> 00:40:20,137
to leave a review on Steam of it.

827
00:40:20,497 --> 00:40:21,378
They want to be able to...

828
00:40:22,058 --> 00:40:24,899
leave a review and then link their review in the Discord saying,

829
00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:27,521
guys I've just reviewed it and then other people will say, I've reviewed it as well.

830
00:40:27,921 --> 00:40:30,682
We all know that Steam reviews are pretty useful, you know,

831
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:33,724
the more and the faster you're getting Steam reviews,

832
00:40:34,284 --> 00:40:37,546
the more potential people are going to see that and are going to,

833
00:40:37,566 --> 00:40:41,548
are going to decide, yeah go on then, I'll buy the game, it seems like people are enjoying this.

834
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:47,254
And of course, then that just kind of rolls along.

835
00:40:47,314 --> 00:40:50,117
The more reviews you're getting and the more people who are playing it

836
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:51,699
in a very small space of time.

837
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:54,503
You know, if you're funneling all of these people directly on launch day,

838
00:40:54,763 --> 00:40:56,426
that shoots you up the Steam charts.

839
00:40:57,367 --> 00:41:01,592
It's just a flurry of action that all happens on launch day.

840
00:41:02,182 --> 00:41:03,743
Thanks to this Discord.

841
00:41:04,023 --> 00:41:06,985
I mean, obviously there's outside sources as well.

842
00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:09,067
You know, you're obviously still doing all the trying

843
00:41:09,087 --> 00:41:11,469
to get press and YouTubers and streamers, et cetera,

844
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:12,109
to play your game.

845
00:41:12,509 --> 00:41:15,091
But you at least know that this chunk of people

846
00:41:15,452 --> 00:41:17,613
are going to be hardcore supporting your game

847
00:41:17,673 --> 00:41:18,154
on launch day.

848
00:41:20,942 --> 00:41:22,264
So yeah, I said a bunch of words,

849
00:41:22,304 --> 00:41:23,885
so this is just kind of a little roundup,

850
00:41:23,945 --> 00:41:27,909
just to really show how simple everything I've just said is.

851
00:41:28,009 --> 00:41:31,653
Nothing I've just said in the last, what, like 45 minutes

852
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:35,116
was really that hard in any way.

853
00:41:35,216 --> 00:41:39,320
The vast majority of what I do is incredibly simple.

854
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,463
It can be a lot of work, is the one thing I would say.

855
00:41:43,384 --> 00:41:45,866
Especially, you know, when I was talking about the meta stuff.

856
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:50,090
That would be me every day doing announcement in the afternoon

857
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:54,553
and then pretty much just sitting back and watching it happen

858
00:41:54,593 --> 00:41:56,434
or maybe nudging it in different directions

859
00:41:56,455 --> 00:41:57,876
for the next couple of hours afterwards.

860
00:41:59,557 --> 00:42:02,579
There's, yeah, it can be a lot of work,

861
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:06,803
and so I guess something I would say is that

862
00:42:06,863 --> 00:42:09,044
if you're in a situation where you're looking at this and thinking,

863
00:42:09,645 --> 00:42:12,607
yeah, but I need to make my game, I don't have time for any of this,

864
00:42:13,488 --> 00:42:14,969
what is quite frankly stupid crap.

865
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:18,991
I would find someone to do it for you,

866
00:42:20,132 --> 00:42:23,094
whether that's a partner or just bringing an extra person on

867
00:42:23,114 --> 00:42:26,876
because it genuinely is, I think we all know at this point,

868
00:42:26,896 --> 00:42:30,158
this stuff is important now, it always kind of was,

869
00:42:30,218 --> 00:42:33,940
but it's just so important that you are actually getting,

870
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,441
you can make the best game ever,

871
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:37,802
but if you haven't done any of this kind of stuff

872
00:42:37,862 --> 00:42:40,003
and it gets to launch day and no one knows it exists,

873
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,605
that's obviously a terrible thing to happen for your game.

874
00:42:45,284 --> 00:42:48,646
But yeah, I would very much suggest starting off simple,

875
00:42:48,886 --> 00:42:50,268
not doing some of the stuff, for example,

876
00:42:50,288 --> 00:42:51,348
that I did with Hypnospace.

877
00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:53,951
Maybe start off less crazy than I have.

878
00:42:55,392 --> 00:42:57,914
And as well, you know, the stuff I talked about,

879
00:42:57,934 --> 00:42:59,095
there's other stuff you could be doing.

880
00:42:59,115 --> 00:43:02,197
There's this website, discordbots.org,

881
00:43:02,558 --> 00:43:04,179
where I found these bots that I use,

882
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:07,402
and where there are thousands of bots

883
00:43:07,442 --> 00:43:08,142
that people have made

884
00:43:08,162 --> 00:43:10,404
that all do very specific functionality.

885
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:11,925
And it's literally a case of.

886
00:43:12,245 --> 00:43:14,227
you click the one you want and click the install button

887
00:43:14,247 --> 00:43:15,668
and it installs into your server.

888
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,369
And then you can tinker around with it.

889
00:43:17,669 --> 00:43:20,951
It's worth going there and just looking for weird stuff

890
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:21,832
that you can do.

891
00:43:22,072 --> 00:43:23,833
Because there's bound to be loads of ideas

892
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:26,935
that I haven't thought of that would work very well,

893
00:43:27,055 --> 00:43:29,517
specifically for what the theme of your game is.

894
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:32,399
Right, I'm done.

895
00:43:32,759 --> 00:43:33,880
Thank you very much for listening.

896
00:43:42,569 --> 00:43:45,051
There is time for questions.

897
00:43:45,471 --> 00:43:46,112
About 15 minutes.

898
00:43:46,152 --> 00:43:47,312
So there's a microphone there.

899
00:43:47,613 --> 00:43:50,075
I think if you basically just exactly what you're doing

900
00:43:50,095 --> 00:43:50,915
line up, then that's great.

901
00:43:51,035 --> 00:43:51,296
Thank you.

902
00:43:52,637 --> 00:43:53,317
Hi, I'm Garrett.

903
00:43:53,477 --> 00:43:53,758
Hello.

904
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:54,378
Is this on?

905
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:56,520
It should be.

906
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,301
Maybe try talking louder into it.

907
00:43:58,341 --> 00:43:58,742
Hello?

908
00:43:59,522 --> 00:44:01,524
Yeah, I can hear you.

909
00:44:02,024 --> 00:44:05,407
At any time, did you feel like you were running a Stanford

910
00:44:05,427 --> 00:44:06,308
prison experiment?

911
00:44:08,109 --> 00:44:09,310
It is interesting.

912
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:15,503
When I started doing this stuff, it doesn't...

913
00:44:16,063 --> 00:44:18,044
It's very hard. When I was just describing stuff to you then,

914
00:44:18,305 --> 00:44:23,548
I actually don't think I really got across how crazy it gets.

915
00:44:23,588 --> 00:44:27,590
There was stuff... I went on holiday for one week in the summer last year,

916
00:44:28,231 --> 00:44:28,371
and...

917
00:44:28,991 --> 00:44:33,996
I was basically just on my phone for the entire time because people, there was those people

918
00:44:34,036 --> 00:44:39,862
in the server who, in the Not Tonight server, who had all convinced themselves that there

919
00:44:39,882 --> 00:44:41,965
was another spy in the server.

920
00:44:42,025 --> 00:44:45,608
I hadn't done anything, like I just, I purposely tried to leave it for a week because I was

921
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:47,130
trying to, I was trying to relax.

922
00:44:48,071 --> 00:44:52,416
And I did not really relax much because these people kept messaging me over and over again.

923
00:44:54,298 --> 00:44:59,283
And yeah, you don't know what it's going to be like until you do one of these community things.

924
00:44:59,984 --> 00:45:02,306
But you at least at the time know it's probably a good thing.

925
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:03,607
Uh, so...

926
00:45:03,627 --> 00:45:05,409
Well, is there any, like, a point where you're like,

927
00:45:05,649 --> 00:45:07,971
oh my gosh, these guys are going too crazy,

928
00:45:08,071 --> 00:45:10,252
I need to, like, do something to, like,

929
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:11,413
put people down?

930
00:45:11,693 --> 00:45:13,134
Yeah, with Not Tonight, especially,

931
00:45:13,154 --> 00:45:14,756
because it's about Brexit,

932
00:45:14,776 --> 00:45:16,237
it's a little bit of a political game,

933
00:45:16,477 --> 00:45:17,658
and that was a tricky one.

934
00:45:17,698 --> 00:45:19,039
It's the kind of stuff I didn't really touch

935
00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:20,160
on the moderation stuff.

936
00:45:21,701 --> 00:45:27,383
That one in particular got difficult at times because there were people who were talking

937
00:45:27,463 --> 00:45:32,445
politics as the meta and they would have heated debates and then someone would say,

938
00:45:32,525 --> 00:45:36,586
guys calm down, and they'd say, oh it's just meta, it's just the meta, we're just playing the meta.

939
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:41,608
And at that point you're like, well, okay.

940
00:45:43,051 --> 00:45:46,432
Maybe, yeah, it was a difficult one.

941
00:45:46,872 --> 00:45:49,953
Hypnospace was easier because there was less politics about it.

942
00:45:50,833 --> 00:45:53,974
But yeah, people definitely go too far at times

943
00:45:54,034 --> 00:45:56,795
and you need to sometimes just like take them to the side,

944
00:45:56,835 --> 00:45:59,116
just like go into a direct message and say,

945
00:45:59,136 --> 00:46:02,237
I'm really happy that you're getting so involved with this

946
00:46:02,357 --> 00:46:04,578
and you're so infused,

947
00:46:05,538 --> 00:46:08,079
but maybe use half the words you're using

948
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:09,319
and don't use caps anymore.

949
00:46:09,499 --> 00:46:10,380
That would be really nice.

950
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:12,160
Yeah.

951
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:12,400
Cheers.

952
00:46:13,458 --> 00:46:13,698
Hi there.

953
00:46:13,998 --> 00:46:14,398
Hello.

954
00:46:14,618 --> 00:46:17,039
So you said, or in your talk you discussed

955
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:18,960
doing this for various titles.

956
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,801
How do you get buy in and trust from the developers

957
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:23,581
to handle their IP properly and take it

958
00:46:23,621 --> 00:46:25,582
in all these new directions to build up the game?

959
00:46:26,382 --> 00:46:29,043
Yeah, a lot of the time what I do,

960
00:46:29,443 --> 00:46:32,024
especially before I start the meta stuff for a game,

961
00:46:32,564 --> 00:46:33,104
is I will...

962
00:46:33,987 --> 00:46:37,148
I will have chats with the developer where,

963
00:46:37,488 --> 00:46:39,509
I mean, by the time I do a meta, I normally,

964
00:46:40,189 --> 00:46:42,650
I would hope that I know the game pretty well at that point,

965
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:44,831
but I like to sit with a developer and say,

966
00:46:44,851 --> 00:46:46,811
I'm planning to do this for the meta

967
00:46:46,911 --> 00:46:48,212
and use these characters.

968
00:46:48,592 --> 00:46:51,833
Does this fit into what you're doing?

969
00:46:52,613 --> 00:46:55,334
There's a game, the game that I'm announcing

970
00:46:55,554 --> 00:46:58,915
in a few weeks is a game about taking a journey

971
00:46:58,995 --> 00:47:00,116
from one place to another.

972
00:47:00,616 --> 00:47:02,356
And so for the meta for that one,

973
00:47:03,197 --> 00:47:08,963
Right now my plan is to make the meta be starting from somewhere else,

974
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:12,067
going to the start point of the game.

975
00:47:12,488 --> 00:47:16,993
So the idea is all of these people will play this Discord game.

976
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:22,225
and they will get to this place and when they get to this place we'll tell them when you

977
00:47:22,245 --> 00:47:27,050
get here we're launching the game and then they will get to the place, obviously, you

978
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:30,333
know, behind the scenes I'm going to be controlling it, making sure they actually get there and

979
00:47:30,353 --> 00:47:31,675
the game isn't delayed inevitably.

980
00:47:32,075 --> 00:47:36,960
But yeah, we're going to make it so they go there and then the idea is the game will launch

981
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,942
and they will carry on their journey then.

982
00:47:39,182 --> 00:47:40,604
You know, like it's, for them it's...

983
00:47:41,414 --> 00:47:43,415
the obvious kind of story arc,

984
00:47:43,435 --> 00:47:44,496
they're playing the next chapter

985
00:47:44,516 --> 00:47:45,397
of what they've already played.

986
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:49,141
So yeah, it's definitely talking to a developer

987
00:47:49,181 --> 00:47:52,884
and working out, does this storyline make sense?

988
00:47:53,184 --> 00:47:55,286
Does this Discord setup make sense for your game?

989
00:47:55,626 --> 00:47:56,127
Essentially.

990
00:47:59,165 --> 00:48:15,063
Hi, so if the Discord is kind of like your endpoint where you're gathering everybody to build up for the eventual game launch, how do you build the entry points like Twitter, for example, or spamming Reddit if there's other ways of doing that?

991
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:19,176
Yeah, I mean, I guess that stuff is a whole other talk, right?

992
00:48:19,216 --> 00:48:23,722
Like about how you're actually sort of building up presences in other places.

993
00:48:24,984 --> 00:48:28,449
I mean, a lot of it is doing very similar stuff, you know?

994
00:48:30,232 --> 00:48:31,754
When it comes to things like Twitter...

995
00:48:32,675 --> 00:48:36,919
It can be a slow build up, but you can do things like running...

996
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:39,501
Like I was saying, I was pushing people into the Discord

997
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:42,763
by giving them something that makes them want to.

998
00:48:43,424 --> 00:48:46,186
You need to ask yourself that question about other platforms as well.

999
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:49,309
Why are people going to follow you on Twitter?

1000
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:51,430
Why are they going to follow the account for your game?

1001
00:48:51,791 --> 00:48:54,092
Is there anything that you can offer them?

1002
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:56,734
Is there a reason why they should join you?

1003
00:48:58,015 --> 00:49:01,938
you tell people if you follow this game account on Twitter,

1004
00:49:02,238 --> 00:49:04,780
then I'm going to pick some random people who are followed

1005
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,223
and they are going to be able to pick a character

1006
00:49:09,263 --> 00:49:10,604
that's in your game or something like that.

1007
00:49:10,824 --> 00:49:12,666
There's lots of different ways that you can,

1008
00:49:12,926 --> 00:49:14,647
with all social platforms really,

1009
00:49:14,947 --> 00:49:16,809
that you can incentivize people

1010
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:19,711
to want to actually follow you.

1011
00:49:20,662 --> 00:49:25,306
A lot of the time just saying, follow me because my game's great, is not really enough because

1012
00:49:25,586 --> 00:49:26,447
everybody's saying that.

1013
00:49:26,988 --> 00:49:30,150
No one's saying, you can follow me if you want, my game's crap, whatever.

1014
00:49:31,471 --> 00:49:33,273
It's all about incentivizing people essentially.

1015
00:49:36,737 --> 00:49:36,917
Hello.

1016
00:49:37,277 --> 00:49:37,517
Hello.

1017
00:49:37,657 --> 00:49:44,079
So you mentioned that one of the hooks to your Discord server

1018
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:46,760
is telling, hey, come play a bit of the game,

1019
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,660
or an early version.

1020
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:53,121
And you keep the community going all the way until lunch.

1021
00:49:53,601 --> 00:49:59,763
So I was wondering, in what stage of the game development

1022
00:50:00,323 --> 00:50:01,643
should you start building community?

1023
00:50:01,663 --> 00:50:04,084
Because I think you can't do that.

1024
00:50:05,307 --> 00:50:07,889
too long or people will get tired.

1025
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:09,090
That's a good question.

1026
00:50:09,531 --> 00:50:11,333
So what I normally do is

1027
00:50:11,713 --> 00:50:13,655
I normally

1028
00:50:13,695 --> 00:50:15,236
tell people that I like

1029
00:50:15,356 --> 00:50:17,098
to announce games

1030
00:50:17,418 --> 00:50:19,460
that are under my publishing

1031
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,182
label somewhere

1032
00:50:21,222 --> 00:50:21,743
between

1033
00:50:22,764 --> 00:50:27,625
four to six months before the game is going to actually be ready.

1034
00:50:28,885 --> 00:50:29,966
It's going to be released.

1035
00:50:31,066 --> 00:50:33,547
The reason I say this is because I think it works time-wise.

1036
00:50:34,027 --> 00:50:37,568
It's like you're saying, you know, if you announce it a year before,

1037
00:50:38,008 --> 00:50:41,129
you can't run a crazy meta game for an entire year.

1038
00:50:41,149 --> 00:50:43,589
That would destroy you.

1039
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:46,310
And also people would probably just lose interest.

1040
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,831
I think that the four to six months...

1041
00:50:49,938 --> 00:50:54,183
time frame works because it's you know sort of you announce in that first

1042
00:50:54,844 --> 00:51:01,132
Month or two you do the beta for the game that you can then sort of have a month to be

1043
00:51:02,054 --> 00:51:05,919
One thing I'll sometimes do is deliver feedback that happened from the beta

1044
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:11,823
two people. So for example, with this game Family Man we've got right now, we ran a beta,

1045
00:51:12,263 --> 00:51:17,267
we were tracking a bunch of stats from the beta, and now every few days we're putting

1046
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:22,050
up these images in the Discord that are like, you know, like a thousand people did this

1047
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:26,753
thing in the game, and here was a decision you all had to make, 40% of people made this

1048
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:27,193
decision.

1049
00:51:27,514 --> 00:51:29,355
Like writing analytics or something like that?

1050
00:51:29,775 --> 00:51:29,995
Say again?

1051
00:51:30,355 --> 00:51:31,736
like analytics in the game?

1052
00:51:32,016 --> 00:51:33,337
Exactly, exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1053
00:51:33,797 --> 00:51:36,918
And so, right, that's the stage we're at with Family Man right now,

1054
00:51:36,978 --> 00:51:40,640
where we're doing this, the meta hasn't started for that game yet.

1055
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,221
Right now, we're delivering these cool ideas to them.

1056
00:51:45,161 --> 00:51:47,002
We've also, in that one, just started doing it

1057
00:51:47,042 --> 00:51:49,163
so that each week we're giving them the opportunity

1058
00:51:49,183 --> 00:51:52,885
to name characters and dogs, things like that in the game.

1059
00:51:53,405 --> 00:51:55,826
And then, when we then know...

1060
00:51:56,366 --> 00:51:58,207
Because the game is nearly ready, essentially.

1061
00:51:58,267 --> 00:52:02,068
It's on the cusp of us saying, OK, this is ready to go.

1062
00:52:02,528 --> 00:52:05,569
At that point, then, when we know that, we can then start

1063
00:52:05,649 --> 00:52:09,911
running this intense meta thing for a couple of months,

1064
00:52:10,591 --> 00:52:14,712
to the point where we've built people into a fever by the

1065
00:52:14,752 --> 00:52:15,653
time the game comes out.

1066
00:52:16,893 --> 00:52:20,014
But yeah, I think sometimes if you do longer than that.

1067
00:52:21,915 --> 00:52:23,616
it can drag, it can really drag.

1068
00:52:23,856 --> 00:52:27,277
Descenders, we did it, we announced the game

1069
00:52:27,317 --> 00:52:28,938
and launched the Discord server eight months

1070
00:52:28,998 --> 00:52:29,918
before the game came out,

1071
00:52:30,259 --> 00:52:31,739
and that felt like it dragged a little bit.

1072
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:34,420
There was times when we were just sort of,

1073
00:52:35,101 --> 00:52:37,402
you know, people were coming to the Discord saying like,

1074
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:41,203
what can we even do in here, why am I even in here?

1075
00:52:42,044 --> 00:52:44,005
You don't want that to happen, is the thing,

1076
00:52:44,265 --> 00:52:45,425
because then people just start leaving.

1077
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:48,927
So yeah, it's definitely worth tightening it up, essentially.

1078
00:52:49,087 --> 00:52:49,367
Thank you.

1079
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:50,628
Cool, cheers.

1080
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:56,761
I'd be curious to hear a little bit more about the demographics of these people.

1081
00:52:56,781 --> 00:52:59,762
I'm curious about the age ranges and the gender balance.

1082
00:52:59,842 --> 00:53:04,444
And I'm also curious if this was a subset of your total audience for the game,

1083
00:53:05,604 --> 00:53:06,324
what are some...

1084
00:53:07,104 --> 00:53:10,986
Are there any unique characteristics to the Discord audience as compared to other segments?

1085
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:12,666
Say that last bit again, sorry.

1086
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:17,748
So, if this is just like one segment of your total audience,

1087
00:53:17,788 --> 00:53:19,828
like some people came to you through other marketing...

1088
00:53:20,857 --> 00:53:26,227
Are there any unique characteristics to the Discord audiences that you could observe as

1089
00:53:26,307 --> 00:53:27,449
compared to other people?

1090
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:29,031
And I'm curious about the demographics.

1091
00:53:29,292 --> 00:53:29,913
Yeah.

1092
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:32,577
Well, an interesting thing about this is that...

1093
00:53:34,695 --> 00:53:41,297
One thing that you really want to be doing is trying to mold your Discord community to be what you would like it to be.

1094
00:53:42,097 --> 00:53:47,358
And again, I didn't really touch on moderation stuff so much because I think there are quite a lot of other talks about it,

1095
00:53:47,478 --> 00:53:53,279
but in general, I want it such that when I get to the launch of the game,

1096
00:53:55,060 --> 00:54:01,161
the people who I have fostered, and especially the mods and the regulars in there,

1097
00:54:03,288 --> 00:54:05,630
as simple as it sounds, just nice people.

1098
00:54:05,971 --> 00:54:08,333
You don't want it so that when you launch the game,

1099
00:54:08,773 --> 00:54:11,236
you've got this toxic group of people who,

1100
00:54:11,476 --> 00:54:12,797
when someone comes into the Discord

1101
00:54:12,837 --> 00:54:14,058
asking for help about the game,

1102
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:15,820
they're just shut down, you know?

1103
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,001
And people are just.

1104
00:54:17,602 --> 00:54:20,323
you know, being sarcastic at them and stuff like that.

1105
00:54:20,623 --> 00:54:22,965
You want it so that you are fostering these people.

1106
00:54:23,525 --> 00:54:25,566
And I don't think it's that hard to do, quite frankly.

1107
00:54:25,707 --> 00:54:25,847
It's...

1108
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:29,429
I personally have this...

1109
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:30,990
I don't think a lot of people do this,

1110
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:34,752
but I have this, like, sort of scorched-earth mentality to it, where...

1111
00:54:35,232 --> 00:54:40,595
If I see someone in a server being any form of bad,

1112
00:54:41,176 --> 00:54:42,836
I just get rid of them immediately.

1113
00:54:42,977 --> 00:54:45,578
I don't do like a three strikes and you're out

1114
00:54:45,598 --> 00:54:46,038
or anything like that.

1115
00:54:46,078 --> 00:54:47,359
I know a lot of places do do that.

1116
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:50,661
For me, if I see one person just saying a word,

1117
00:54:50,681 --> 00:54:53,602
you know, that is a word that is not okay with me,

1118
00:54:53,942 --> 00:54:55,183
they are gone immediately.

1119
00:54:55,563 --> 00:54:57,504
And I find that works quite well for me

1120
00:54:57,564 --> 00:54:59,285
because by the time I get to the launch.

1121
00:55:00,304 --> 00:55:01,205
people just know.

1122
00:55:01,225 --> 00:55:03,927
If someone comes in and starts talking weirdly,

1123
00:55:03,947 --> 00:55:05,068
other people are like, yeah,

1124
00:55:05,108 --> 00:55:06,249
you might not want to talk like that

1125
00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:08,831
because Mike is going to see it in a second.

1126
00:55:09,411 --> 00:55:12,173
Which, you know, is, I don't know.

1127
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:15,896
It works, I think, because I think when people

1128
00:55:16,036 --> 00:55:17,877
don't do that and they do the three strikes or whatever,

1129
00:55:17,937 --> 00:55:19,739
I think a lot of the time that's when, you know,

1130
00:55:19,759 --> 00:55:23,702
like a YouTuber is trying to build a community

1131
00:55:23,782 --> 00:55:26,003
for their streams and their videos and stuff.

1132
00:55:26,424 --> 00:55:28,465
We make games and we don't want.

1133
00:55:30,163 --> 00:55:32,985
I don't want idiots talking about or playing my games.

1134
00:55:33,325 --> 00:55:34,666
I just want nice people.

1135
00:55:35,686 --> 00:55:38,047
I mean, you know, it's a bit,

1136
00:55:38,848 --> 00:55:40,089
I mean, we've seen the Steam forum,

1137
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:41,129
so that's never gonna happen,

1138
00:55:41,209 --> 00:55:43,931
but yeah, that's kind of what I try to aim for.

1139
00:55:45,191 --> 00:55:49,454
The actual demographic of people in the server,

1140
00:55:50,194 --> 00:55:52,315
to be honest, is not a thing I think much about

1141
00:55:52,715 --> 00:55:53,076
because

1142
00:55:54,997 --> 00:55:58,759
Because quite frankly, when the game comes out,

1143
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,720
the important thing is that this group of people

1144
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:06,603
are just ready to go as your sort of hype train for the game.

1145
00:56:06,623 --> 00:56:11,225
I think a lot of the time it is younger people, you know?

1146
00:56:11,405 --> 00:56:13,746
And we've had some servers, like the Family Man server,

1147
00:56:13,766 --> 00:56:17,208
we've had a lot of what you can tell is very young people coming in,

1148
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:21,290
who, you know, you can, you realize are probably...

1149
00:56:21,952 --> 00:56:23,573
not going to buy the game when it comes out

1150
00:56:23,653 --> 00:56:25,414
and are just looking for a free game.

1151
00:56:26,894 --> 00:56:29,235
But honestly, with each game I've done,

1152
00:56:29,295 --> 00:56:30,776
it's just kind of works itself out in the end.

1153
00:56:30,816 --> 00:56:32,236
You find, you slowly but surely,

1154
00:56:32,276 --> 00:56:35,417
you find the people who are right for your community

1155
00:56:35,937 --> 00:56:37,738
and you just start to mold it around them, really.

1156
00:56:38,679 --> 00:56:39,039
Thank you.

1157
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:39,599
Thanks.

1158
00:56:42,406 --> 00:56:43,046
Hi there.

1159
00:56:43,327 --> 00:56:43,487
Hi.

1160
00:56:44,047 --> 00:56:50,634
How do you manage the process of funnelling people into the one community access point

1161
00:56:50,674 --> 00:56:54,138
that you want people to be in, like the Discord, because that's where your energy is going?

1162
00:56:54,899 --> 00:56:59,423
If people are starting their own community, like a Facebook group or Facebook community

1163
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:02,647
external to that, how do you manage the process?

1164
00:57:04,048 --> 00:57:06,212
stopping the fragmentation of that community.

1165
00:57:06,312 --> 00:57:11,722
For me, it's just a whole lot of spamming that link everywhere, you know?

1166
00:57:12,042 --> 00:57:12,603
I wish it was...

1167
00:57:14,505 --> 00:57:18,689
I wish it was more professional than that, quite frankly, but really, when I announce a game,

1168
00:57:19,089 --> 00:57:22,312
I just make sure that Discord link is everywhere.

1169
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:25,575
You know, I'm putting it in the press release for the game,

1170
00:57:25,635 --> 00:57:29,678
I'm putting it at the end of the video, I'm putting it in the trailer's description,

1171
00:57:30,179 --> 00:57:35,563
I'm spreading it on Facebook and Twitter, I'm, like I say, I'm emailing.

1172
00:57:35,904 --> 00:57:40,107
I will directly email all of these free Steam keyplaces, saying,

1173
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:41,829
here's a game I've got coming up.

1174
00:57:42,409 --> 00:57:45,291
please, do you want to post this link on your site?

1175
00:57:46,552 --> 00:57:49,054
It's just a whole lot of just putting it absolutely,

1176
00:57:49,254 --> 00:57:50,635
subreddits are another good one.

1177
00:57:51,355 --> 00:57:53,257
Reddit, there's loads of people who want to play

1178
00:57:53,417 --> 00:57:54,678
a free early copy of a game.

1179
00:57:55,398 --> 00:57:58,680
You know, there's the games one, indie games one,

1180
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,302
game dev one, there's loads of different subreddits

1181
00:58:01,382 --> 00:58:03,764
where there's tens of thousands of people in those

1182
00:58:04,184 --> 00:58:07,867
who are pretty happy to click a link and sign up to a thing.

1183
00:58:08,987 --> 00:58:09,948
So yeah, the...

1184
00:58:10,915 --> 00:58:14,017
The horrible answer is to spam as many people as you can.

1185
00:58:14,297 --> 00:58:17,138
I would say there's nowhere not to put it, you know?

1186
00:58:17,338 --> 00:58:20,740
Because if people have joined a Facebook group or something,

1187
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,021
they're interested in the game in the first place,

1188
00:58:22,061 --> 00:58:26,443
so you might as well try and funnel them into that place.

1189
00:58:26,835 --> 00:58:32,216
And if someone does create their own community group that you don't have control over, do

1190
00:58:32,236 --> 00:58:36,136
you try to create your own version of that and just drive people back to the Discord

1191
00:58:36,336 --> 00:58:37,597
or just let that exist?

1192
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:41,417
I usually, I mean if you're in that situation where people are creating their own group

1193
00:58:41,457 --> 00:58:42,978
then that's pretty nice for you, right?

1194
00:58:43,018 --> 00:58:45,958
That shows that there's a decent amount of interest in your game.

1195
00:58:46,218 --> 00:58:49,819
So I don't think I would ever try and take control of that or close it down.

1196
00:58:50,619 --> 00:58:54,220
It's more like, I guess I'd see if there were ways I could support that group.

1197
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:59,462
You know if it made sense to be telling people hey, there's this other group with these other people in it as well

1198
00:58:59,743 --> 00:59:00,443
I might do that

1199
00:59:01,524 --> 00:59:05,946
But I don't think I don't think I'd ever be in a position where I'd want to sort of take control

1200
00:59:05,966 --> 00:59:09,408
I guess there might be a situation where maybe the group is not nice

1201
00:59:09,969 --> 00:59:15,472
You and you kind of want to shut that down, but I I personally haven't been in that situation yet, so thank you

1202
00:59:17,312 --> 00:59:17,532
Hello.

1203
00:59:17,652 --> 00:59:17,932
Hello.

1204
00:59:18,633 --> 00:59:20,313
So coming to the part that you mentioned

1205
00:59:20,353 --> 00:59:22,474
that some of the developers, like me or someone,

1206
00:59:22,874 --> 00:59:25,414
we would think that we don't have time for all this stuff.

1207
00:59:25,434 --> 00:59:26,435
We have to make a game, right?

1208
00:59:26,775 --> 00:59:29,976
So we might have to go and find some partner or someone else

1209
00:59:29,996 --> 00:59:30,836
who would do this for us.

1210
00:59:31,556 --> 00:59:34,057
But I feel like in the earlier stages of the game,

1211
00:59:34,497 --> 00:59:34,637
that

1212
00:59:35,377 --> 00:59:41,599
The amount of involvement and the amount of knowledge that we have about the game some other person wouldn't be able to do that

1213
00:59:41,659 --> 00:59:46,981
Good in the game. Yeah, I was sharing and all so I would still feel that I would need to get involved and I would still

1214
00:59:47,721 --> 00:59:51,743
Have to spend a lot of time doing all of this stuff and get away from the development

1215
00:59:51,803 --> 00:59:56,104
Yeah, because because you're like me you're a control freak right like you you need sir

1216
00:59:56,184 --> 00:59:59,425
Yeah, you you you hate the idea that somebody else will be running exactly

1217
00:59:59,786 --> 01:00:05,157
Yeah, unfortunately I've been having to learn that I have to let go at some points and just, you know, I have to

1218
01:00:06,179 --> 01:00:07,281
try and let other people

1219
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:11,270
take charge of other things, I would imagine that would be,

1220
01:00:11,611 --> 01:00:13,711
if you just do not have the time to be doing this stuff,

1221
01:00:13,751 --> 01:00:16,212
if you can admit to yourself, there's no way I can do this,

1222
01:00:16,612 --> 01:00:18,672
it's important, it's still important,

1223
01:00:18,752 --> 01:00:21,673
and you can't, it's better to try and find someone

1224
01:00:21,693 --> 01:00:23,494
who can do it for you than to just not do it.

1225
01:00:24,614 --> 01:00:28,815
So I would probably say, you need to find someone

1226
01:00:29,075 --> 01:00:30,895
who is passionate to do it, essentially.

1227
01:00:30,915 --> 01:00:32,336
So like there are two parts, maybe.

1228
01:00:33,116 --> 01:00:36,640
I'm not able to find the good person, so I'll have to invest some more time finding the right person.

1229
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:40,564
Or should I take some time out of my schedule to do all of this stuff myself?

1230
01:00:41,825 --> 01:00:42,826
It's different with each case.

1231
01:00:43,367 --> 01:00:48,472
Like, you know, it depends on the game you're making and the time you have and

1232
01:00:48,552 --> 01:00:52,596
whether if you're doing this, it will delay your game by a long time.

1233
01:00:52,636 --> 01:00:53,737
And you know, it's...

1234
01:00:54,714 --> 01:00:56,075
There will be situations where people,

1235
01:00:56,435 --> 01:00:58,697
most people making games, it's quite intense, right?

1236
01:00:58,837 --> 01:01:01,519
Especially as you're getting up to the launch of your game.

1237
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:04,082
So it might be that you can't be doing this stuff at launch

1238
01:01:04,902 --> 01:01:07,224
because having the intensity of making a game

1239
01:01:07,324 --> 01:01:09,406
and the intensity of running a Discord server

1240
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:11,047
might make you explode.

1241
01:01:12,088 --> 01:01:15,271
So yeah, it sounds like from your situation,

1242
01:01:15,331 --> 01:01:18,354
you probably maybe need to find someone

1243
01:01:18,594 --> 01:01:22,137
and just sort of grit your teeth and see what they can do.

1244
01:01:22,835 --> 01:01:23,737
Okay, thank you

1245
01:01:27,701 --> 01:01:27,961
Hey Mike.

1246
01:01:28,202 --> 01:01:29,403
Hello.

1247
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:34,147
Do you see any value in doing company discords where you're putting your games?

1248
01:01:34,807 --> 01:01:37,410
Do you know, other people do, I know there's other publishers who do.

1249
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:43,095
I was talking to one of them from Rofiori yesterday, they have just a singular discord

1250
01:01:43,115 --> 01:01:46,718
server and then channels for each of the things.

1251
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:49,901
I don't like to do that.

1252
01:01:50,121 --> 01:01:52,203
It's less work doing that, obviously.

1253
01:01:55,066 --> 01:01:58,913
I don't like to do that because I think there's benefits.

1254
01:02:02,612 --> 01:02:03,893
don't give a crap about me.

1255
01:02:04,093 --> 01:02:06,175
You know, they don't care who No More Robots are.

1256
01:02:06,215 --> 01:02:07,416
They care what the game is.

1257
01:02:07,476 --> 01:02:09,377
That's why they joined the server in the first place.

1258
01:02:09,698 --> 01:02:11,659
So why would they want to join a Discord server

1259
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:13,661
that's filled with other games they don't care about?

1260
01:02:14,101 --> 01:02:15,802
And they care about the singular one channel.

1261
01:02:15,822 --> 01:02:18,564
I imagine for you it might make sense

1262
01:02:18,664 --> 01:02:20,546
because all of your games, you know,

1263
01:02:20,606 --> 01:02:22,627
so you've got the games and the sequels

1264
01:02:22,708 --> 01:02:24,789
and they're all sort of quite similar.

1265
01:02:24,809 --> 01:02:26,030
So maybe it would make sense for.

1266
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:29,912
for someone like you, but there's other benefits as well.

1267
01:02:29,932 --> 01:02:31,872
You know, when you're getting a verified server,

1268
01:02:32,232 --> 01:02:33,913
if you put your game on the Discord store,

1269
01:02:34,233 --> 01:02:35,834
they then put the store link,

1270
01:02:36,234 --> 01:02:38,995
it automatically appears at the top of your Discord server.

1271
01:02:39,095 --> 01:02:40,836
So people can now buy Descenders

1272
01:02:40,856 --> 01:02:44,157
through the Descenders Discord server.

1273
01:02:45,597 --> 01:02:49,199
So I think there's benefits to each way,

1274
01:02:49,539 --> 01:02:50,919
but I just like my way better.

1275
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:51,260
Yeah.

1276
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,500
Thank you.

1277
01:02:55,765 --> 01:03:00,786
Thank you, Mike. I really appreciate this great information about pre-launch prep now.

1278
01:03:00,866 --> 01:03:01,227
No worries.

1279
01:03:02,187 --> 01:03:08,308
Is there anything in here that can help a product that has gone to a less than stellar launch already?

1280
01:03:09,428 --> 01:03:13,189
Yeah, it's a tricky one. The whole, you know, is there something you can do after launch of a game?

1281
01:03:14,109 --> 01:03:17,650
It's not just for Discord stuff, just, you know, for everything.

1282
01:03:19,859 --> 01:03:26,543
I imagine if I was in a situation where I'd sort of had a launch that wasn't great,

1283
01:03:28,264 --> 01:03:35,247
I would start to wonder how I can sort of take what I've already got

1284
01:03:36,048 --> 01:03:44,517
and maybe even spin it off into a separate product that can then be, you know, sort of

1285
01:03:44,537 --> 01:03:54,707
announced and have a beta for it, etc. as a separate entity. But it depends on, it just depends on...

1286
01:03:56,045 --> 01:03:57,527
what it is, I guess, really.

1287
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:59,609
But yeah, it's a tricky one.

1288
01:03:59,789 --> 01:04:01,431
I don't think anything I talked about today

1289
01:04:02,633 --> 01:04:05,697
can probably help after a launch, to be honest.

1290
01:04:05,777 --> 01:04:07,959
It's probably pre-launch stuff, this, really.

1291
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:11,183
So, sorry, that's probably not the answer you want to hear,

1292
01:04:11,223 --> 01:04:11,363
is it?

1293
01:04:13,165 --> 01:04:13,846
Cool, all right.

1294
01:04:14,147 --> 01:04:14,687
Thank you again.

1295
01:04:14,988 --> 01:04:15,508
Cheers, everyone.
