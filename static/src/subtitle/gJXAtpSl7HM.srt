00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,131
Hello everybody, it's very nice to see you.

2
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:10,712
My name is Grace Brooksner.

3
00:00:10,872 --> 00:00:13,333
I made a game called Grace Brooksner Presents

4
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:15,594
the Haunted Islander from Detective Game,

5
00:00:16,615 --> 00:00:20,076
which I assume all of you have played and loved

6
00:00:20,557 --> 00:00:21,997
because it made $17 million.

7
00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:28,398
Not really.

8
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,261
So my talk today is about how to build games around humour and write jokes that aren't

9
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:35,982
super generic.

10
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:41,405
So I'm the creative lead of a studio called Worm Club, definitely a real company.

11
00:00:42,846 --> 00:00:46,148
And we're in the process of making another Frog Detective game at the moment.

12
00:00:46,568 --> 00:00:49,510
So let's get started with some disclaimers.

13
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:53,477
So let's have a disclaimer.

14
00:00:54,598 --> 00:00:55,880
I can't make your jokes funny.

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,424
I can give you tools and ideas for how to structure your jokes,

16
00:00:59,524 --> 00:01:00,605
but I'm not a magician.

17
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:03,649
I can't turn you into a comedic genius.

18
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,351
Some people just aren't funny.

19
00:01:05,831 --> 00:01:06,752
That's fine.

20
00:01:07,753 --> 00:01:12,317
The other tiny disclaimer with this one is that the talk itself is kind of full of info

21
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:16,741
and isn't exactly funny, like I'm trying to give you as much information as possible.

22
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:19,323
So apologies in advance for the lack of jokes.

23
00:01:19,463 --> 00:01:22,125
If you were here for a stand-up routine, I'm really sorry.

24
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:25,128
There's probably like a weird stand-up bar somewhere.

25
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:27,090
But this is a serious talk.

26
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:28,931
So no laughing.

27
00:01:31,017 --> 00:01:31,817
What did I just say?

28
00:01:32,758 --> 00:01:35,258
Okay, so I'm gonna give you a bit of an overview

29
00:01:35,298 --> 00:01:36,579
of what I'll be talking about today.

30
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,119
I'll start with an introduction to myself,

31
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,660
giving some context to this talk

32
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,600
and sort of attempting to prove

33
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,081
that I know what I'm talking about,

34
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,001
which is up for debate.

35
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:49,782
I'll also be going into genre subversion

36
00:01:50,242 --> 00:01:53,243
and how it's an interesting way to onboard your players

37
00:01:53,343 --> 00:01:56,004
and signal that your game doesn't necessarily fit

38
00:01:56,064 --> 00:01:58,365
in the traditional mold of your chosen genre.

39
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,596
After that we'll be talking about how to write characters from yourself to make them more

40
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:07,782
authentic and how to make that funny without resorting to offensive stereotypes.

41
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:12,570
And lastly, just some general tips and tricks about how jokes can be structured,

42
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,692
a kind of 101 on comedy writing for your video games.

43
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:20,613
All righty, so a little bit on me.

44
00:02:21,314 --> 00:02:23,635
My name is Grace, as we have established.

45
00:02:24,995 --> 00:02:27,336
I guess my most well-known game would be The Haunted Island,

46
00:02:27,396 --> 00:02:29,057
which is IGF nominated.

47
00:02:29,757 --> 00:02:30,698
Please clap. No, don't.

48
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:34,979
And we're in the process of making The Invisible Wizard,

49
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:37,160
which is the second game in the Frog Detective series.

50
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:42,547
So I guess mostly I'll be talking about the process of writing the Frog Detective games

51
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:44,968
and giving specific examples from those games.

52
00:02:46,148 --> 00:02:51,711
It's also worth mentioning that I've made a pretty big selection of small-scale diorama

53
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:57,713
games which have a bit of a mix of environmental and physical humour and comedy writing, and

54
00:02:57,733 --> 00:03:04,516
I learned a lot from those games about how to do visual comedy using animation and environmental

55
00:03:04,556 --> 00:03:05,117
pacing.

56
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:06,017
Yep.

57
00:03:06,357 --> 00:03:06,577
Yep.

58
00:03:07,097 --> 00:03:07,218
So.

59
00:03:08,038 --> 00:03:12,907
a little bit more background, which not a lot of people know, I did do stand-up comedy for

60
00:03:12,947 --> 00:03:16,793
two years before I got into games. I was living in a small town so like...

61
00:03:18,451 --> 00:03:21,094
the comedy scene wasn't huge, but I was getting booked,

62
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:24,717
I guess, a couple of times a month.

63
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:29,262
And my comedy style wasn't like a traditional

64
00:03:29,362 --> 00:03:33,486
sort of comedy, it was absurd and deadpan,

65
00:03:33,526 --> 00:03:35,088
kind of like my sense of humor.

66
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:39,072
But what I learned doing that is that those jokes

67
00:03:39,412 --> 00:03:41,194
and that style of comedy is

68
00:03:42,335 --> 00:03:48,159
just as funny as traditionally structured jokes. So, I'll be referencing my experience with stand

69
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:54,703
up a little bit as well. A bit of background on the Haunted Island, for those of you who don't

70
00:03:54,763 --> 00:04:03,609
know it, it made it in about five months with my team. So, me, Thomas, who did the programming and

71
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:08,452
tools, and Dan. My job in the game was to do the assets and the narrative and the dialogue.

72
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,303
So Dan was the composer and I basically gave him the pitch of like,

73
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:18,946
hey, I want to make pro-ro, but it's a frog, can you do music for that?

74
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,247
And he was like, hell yeah.

75
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:21,849
That's my impression of Dan.

76
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:29,864
So the focus of The Haunted Island was the dialogue and the humor, and every interaction

77
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:34,307
that we had in that game had to have some sort of purpose behind it, and the biggest

78
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:38,470
purpose of that was just to make people laugh, because I feel very strongly about games that

79
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,592
are just silly and there for making you feel good, because there's a lot of horribleness

80
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:43,153
in the world.

81
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:49,737
The game actually did pretty well considering that it was a very low budget game made in

82
00:04:49,777 --> 00:04:50,357
five months.

83
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:58,262
like the whole team was just me and Tom basically. I did all the marketing and stuff, so the reception

84
00:04:58,302 --> 00:05:02,985
was really positive from both the players and the critics. I'll be going into a little bit of why I

85
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:09,488
think that is a bit later. I will mention however that some people were pretty confused by it because

86
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,010
it's not really a traditional game in any sense. It's...

87
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:18,377
maybe more traditional than my previous games, but yeah, it's not what you expect when you

88
00:05:18,437 --> 00:05:24,519
hear detective game. That response didn't really matter too much to me because there's like a

89
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:29,000
myriad of games out there for every type of person and I don't think there's that many games like the

90
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:35,522
Haunted Island, so it's fine. I'll also be showing you, just to give you some background on the

91
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:41,203
style of game and the tone that I was using for the game, I'll show you the intro sequence.

92
00:05:42,202 --> 00:05:44,023
So let's have a look-a-roo.

93
00:06:27,535 --> 00:06:29,818
Subscribe and Btw many more yet to come!

94
00:06:53,745 --> 00:07:01,433
I'm a genius. Okay, so that kind of segues kind of nicely into the first topic which is genre subversion.

95
00:07:01,513 --> 00:07:09,221
So let's get started. So I guess beginning with this you should really think about how most genres

96
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:13,986
that are commonly used for games they have a lot of cultural baggage and it can be good and bad but

97
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:16,048
when you find a genre that you want to subvert

98
00:07:16,962 --> 00:07:19,863
with the right amount of effort and work into subverting it,

99
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:22,364
you can create something amazing and unexpected.

100
00:07:23,404 --> 00:07:26,065
So as an example from Frog Detective,

101
00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:30,066
I took a genre that has a lot of existing expectations.

102
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:33,367
So detective games often have moody, noir tones,

103
00:07:33,407 --> 00:07:35,768
like grizzly bodies and chase sequences

104
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:37,068
and like cigarettes and all that.

105
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:47,544
And not all of that appeals to me personally as a developer, and I wasn't really seeing the genre subverted in any of the games that I was playing in the way that I would do it.

106
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:52,592
So I kind of found an avenue there that hadn't really been explored to its fullest extent.

107
00:07:53,776 --> 00:07:56,497
And for me, it's almost always funny to have a genre

108
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:59,418
that fits the setting of your game, but not the tone.

109
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:02,799
And for me, that was like an island

110
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:04,920
with a kind of fake mystery on it.

111
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,941
Everything about the setting had to be translatable to Noir,

112
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:10,241
but I also knew that the tone

113
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:12,102
was gonna be very lighthearted and gentle.

114
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:24,917
And beginning this process can actually be pretty weird, but it's best to start by finding your inspirations in the genre that you're looking at, whether that's games or movies or TV shows.

115
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,320
So get a feel of the genre so that you know what you're working with.

116
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:33,033
I played a bunch of LA Noir when I was first getting into games,

117
00:08:33,093 --> 00:08:35,253
and it was one of those first games where I could see

118
00:08:35,713 --> 00:08:38,454
the potential for humor in the genre, which kind of doesn't

119
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:41,435
sound exactly what you think of when you think of LA Noir.

120
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,595
But there's this bit in that game

121
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:47,316
where the character will pick up clues and just kind of wiggle

122
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:48,676
it around in their hands.

123
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:50,577
And to me, that's really funny.

124
00:08:50,657 --> 00:08:53,837
And that was an inspiration for having,

125
00:08:53,857 --> 00:08:56,738
so in Frog Detective, there's a magnifying glass

126
00:08:56,758 --> 00:08:58,458
that you can just pick up and put to your face.

127
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,261
and it doesn't actually do anything, it just warps the image, but it's just part of that role-playing

128
00:09:03,561 --> 00:09:09,043
thing. And it's super goofy because everyone knows that you're not playing Frog Detective

129
00:09:09,103 --> 00:09:14,566
to actually be the Frog Detective, but it's just an additional role-playing thing. And what I found

130
00:09:14,606 --> 00:09:19,168
is that even though it's entirely useless, a bunch of people were using it just to be like,

131
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:22,450
hmm, yes, is this a clue? You know, literally nothing is a clue.

132
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,061
And so when you're doing your genre specific research,

133
00:09:27,782 --> 00:09:30,062
you've got to find what makes that genre what it is.

134
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:32,984
So those elements that you find that you decide,

135
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:35,004
okay, this is what this genre is.

136
00:09:35,064 --> 00:09:36,485
Those are the elements that you'll keep

137
00:09:36,565 --> 00:09:37,425
and use in your game.

138
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:39,786
And for me, the most recognizable part

139
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:43,207
of the detective genre is the music and the camera angles.

140
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:45,408
So I wanted to take those elements as they were

141
00:09:45,508 --> 00:09:46,429
and put them in the game.

142
00:09:47,534 --> 00:09:53,338
So every talk sequence in The Haunted Island has camera angles that are copied from TV shows.

143
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:57,421
I had to do like a bunch of research into like cinematography.

144
00:09:57,461 --> 00:10:00,003
I just don't care about cinematography but I wanted it to be like...

145
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:03,515
as close to that genre as I could.

146
00:10:03,996 --> 00:10:05,498
And that kind of amps up the comedy

147
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,363
because it's like taking the visuals of it super seriously

148
00:10:10,503 --> 00:10:12,505
even though it's not a very serious game.

149
00:10:13,066 --> 00:10:15,668
And another element of the detective genre that I liked

150
00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:18,491
was that a lot of detective shows are episodic.

151
00:10:18,872 --> 00:10:20,514
So with a new mystery every episode,

152
00:10:20,534 --> 00:10:21,615
think Poro, think,

153
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:30,664
Columbo, Sherlock, all those. So for that I gave the game a theme song at the start and a teaser

154
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:37,691
for the next episode at the end. And basically this step is all about making sure that your

155
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:42,756
audience knows what you're subverting. So the players need to recognise what the genre should be

156
00:10:43,136 --> 00:10:44,578
so that they know when you're playing with it.

157
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:48,814
So this is where it gets a little bit trickier.

158
00:10:48,854 --> 00:10:53,118
It is a bit harder to do, but when you start to actually subvert the genre,

159
00:10:53,158 --> 00:10:54,619
that's when it starts to become funny.

160
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,523
The best way that I've found to do this is to decide which parts of the genre

161
00:10:58,543 --> 00:10:59,323
that you don't like.

162
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:04,886
So in relation to The Haunted Island, one of my biggest pet peeves of the genre is when

163
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:09,089
detectives don't care about their jobs or are like super rude, but they're amazing at

164
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:09,929
solving cases.

165
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:13,551
Like, I just want the main character and everything to be super lovely.

166
00:11:13,571 --> 00:11:16,913
So in the game, the detective is...

167
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,676
like super loves being a detective but isn't necessarily awesome at it.

168
00:11:24,277 --> 00:11:29,499
So detectives are friendly to everyone and apologetic when they're suspicious of someone.

169
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,981
So already with that you have a few more, you have a more pleasant character but there's that

170
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:39,884
silliness there and how the detective interacts with suspects. And a maybe more prominent change

171
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:43,785
was that I made it so that nothing dramatic ever happens in the game. So there's no like

172
00:11:44,446 --> 00:11:47,687
murder or grand conspiracies yet.

173
00:11:50,682 --> 00:11:55,603
But I want the story to have an air of mystery without anything sinister actually happening.

174
00:11:55,623 --> 00:12:02,205
I also liked the idea of nobody in the island being particularly helpful or like every sort

175
00:12:02,225 --> 00:12:06,906
of interaction not really meaning anything apart from just like, oh, I need a magnet

176
00:12:06,946 --> 00:12:07,626
if you've got one.

177
00:12:08,986 --> 00:12:13,908
So when you subvert genre, make sure that the elements that you subvert aren't the essential

178
00:12:13,988 --> 00:12:14,388
elements.

179
00:12:14,928 --> 00:12:18,950
Because if I think I had, you know, if I had sacrificed the music or the cinematography,

180
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,271
the genre wouldn't be recognisable anymore.

181
00:12:21,331 --> 00:12:24,333
So it's going back to that step and making sure that the genre you have

182
00:12:24,933 --> 00:12:28,295
is being represented properly, even if it's not being represented fully.

183
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,004
One thing that I want to bring forward into the development of The Invisible Wizard is

184
00:12:35,384 --> 00:12:37,386
managing expectations a little bit better.

185
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:42,610
So I presented The Haunted Island as a detective game, even though it is a little bit tongue

186
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,091
in cheek.

187
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:48,215
But the problem was there wasn't actually any detective work, any traditional detective

188
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:48,455
work.

189
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:49,276
So people that were...

190
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:52,944
picking up the Haunted Island to be a detective,

191
00:12:53,144 --> 00:12:54,385
were kind of disappointed.

192
00:12:54,405 --> 00:12:57,927
It didn't, like that doesn't bother me too much,

193
00:12:57,967 --> 00:12:59,828
but it was cited in some negative reviews,

194
00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:02,770
which as we know can impact the success of your game.

195
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,671
So with the next game,

196
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:06,752
I'm planning to add more of those traditional

197
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:11,175
investigative, yeah, elements.

198
00:13:12,196 --> 00:13:16,102
of detective games into the sequel to appease that crowd a little bit more.

199
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:21,830
I think this was like a pretty big lesson for me and while I wouldn't normally care too much,

200
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,075
I think actually leaning into that a little bit more will improve the games.

201
00:13:26,601 --> 00:13:30,046
The other thing is if you really don't want to include these certain mechanics that are

202
00:13:30,086 --> 00:13:34,773
in other games of your genre, you can forego them, but you have to make sure that you signal

203
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:39,119
it in your store page or in your trailers so that the people that aren't into it will

204
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:39,640
stay away.

205
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,823
Or don't, because I'm not your dad.

206
00:13:44,847 --> 00:13:49,829
Alright so I'm going to move on to how I write my characters which is probably the thing that I

207
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:54,650
thought the most about while doing this because I hadn't actually written a game fully before.

208
00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:00,533
So it was like how do I make like 13 people that are not just me every time?

209
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:07,713
Because I find it almost impossible to get myself into the headspace of someone that isn't me,

210
00:14:07,893 --> 00:14:11,136
or someone that is really far removed from my own lived experience.

211
00:14:11,677 --> 00:14:15,880
And I struggled with this a lot because I would 3D model characters and try to develop their

212
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:21,125
personality from their appearance. And it wasn't working because all my characters are just like

213
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:26,369
smiling animals. So there wasn't like a whole bunch of personality just in their visuals.

214
00:14:28,425 --> 00:14:32,149
So what I did is I developed a system for writing unique and believable characters to

215
00:14:32,189 --> 00:14:32,789
help with this.

216
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:38,114
So when you're writing characters, especially characters that are funny, it's really good

217
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:42,739
to draw from what you know because otherwise you can fall into the trap of making fun of

218
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,620
people and traits.

219
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,422
Otherwise it can lean into more offensive stuff.

220
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:50,925
So if you're writing comedy characters that aren't of your demographic, you need to consult

221
00:14:50,965 --> 00:14:52,386
with people from that demographic.

222
00:14:52,606 --> 00:14:56,409
Don't make assumptions about how people are because that can turn into stereotyped and

223
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:59,511
offensive characters, especially when you're writing comedy.

224
00:14:59,991 --> 00:15:04,354
So if you really want to make a game with a diverse cast, especially a comedy game,

225
00:15:04,494 --> 00:15:06,915
leave some room in your budget for hiring consultants.

226
00:15:07,976 --> 00:15:11,238
And that kind of goes for any narrative game, but I feel like it is quite important for

227
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,639
comedy because comedy can be.

228
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,327
offend like pretty easily.

229
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:23,351
So, going into the more specifics of how to write those believable characters,

230
00:15:24,392 --> 00:15:31,514
I find the best way is to base them on myself. So, for the haunted island, I took a look at the

231
00:15:31,534 --> 00:15:36,616
part of myself that stems, sorry, the parts of my personality that stem from mental illness,

232
00:15:37,457 --> 00:15:40,998
and I thought about how to translate those traits onto a character.

233
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:45,800
So, writing from what you know is always going to be the most productive way to make characters feel

234
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,100
real.

235
00:15:47,423 --> 00:15:53,067
So for example, four parts of my personality are that I'm anxious, I'm impatient, I can

236
00:15:53,107 --> 00:15:55,468
be pretty shy, and I can also be quite stubborn.

237
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:59,771
And they're not nice traits and they're not attractive traits, but you can write from

238
00:15:59,811 --> 00:15:59,971
them.

239
00:16:01,012 --> 00:16:06,315
And when I've written down a bunch of personality traits, I assign them each to a character.

240
00:16:06,335 --> 00:16:11,679
And then I give each character something that they want or something that they like.

241
00:16:12,457 --> 00:16:14,978
And I'll go into detail in this more in the next slides,

242
00:16:15,018 --> 00:16:17,398
but I think giving them a goal gives them a purpose.

243
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:20,400
So for example, you could have like a super rude character

244
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,040
that really wants a boiled egg.

245
00:16:22,821 --> 00:16:24,801
And then there's like a character there,

246
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:25,582
that's a character.

247
00:16:27,142 --> 00:16:29,043
And once you have a trait and a purpose

248
00:16:29,303 --> 00:16:30,564
or something that the character wants,

249
00:16:30,644 --> 00:16:32,184
you can challenge your character.

250
00:16:32,464 --> 00:16:34,005
And that's where the dialogue comes in.

251
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:35,045
So in the games.

252
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:40,288
I use the detective as a kind of straight man, but not like a literal straight man, just like a

253
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:45,391
comedy straight man. Yeah, the detective relies on logic to solve these problems.

254
00:16:46,211 --> 00:16:50,874
So, none of the characters in my game are particularly logical, so writing a dialogue

255
00:16:50,894 --> 00:16:54,596
between an odd character and a stable character creates some tension and...

256
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:56,117
It can be really funny.

257
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,180
As long as it comes from your own lived experience,

258
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,261
as we have gone over,

259
00:17:00,582 --> 00:17:02,684
don't write characters who are mentally ill unless

260
00:17:02,724 --> 00:17:04,806
you have experienced that or you have hired

261
00:17:04,846 --> 00:17:06,347
a consultant. Don't be messy!

262
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:08,069
I will not tell you again.

263
00:17:12,015 --> 00:17:16,397
So I'll go into specifics about the characters that I wrote and I'll start with Martin because

264
00:17:16,437 --> 00:17:22,239
Martin has probably the most dialogue in the game and Martin is a really anxious character

265
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:27,922
who just like really really wants to feel safe. So what I did with Martin is I looked at what

266
00:17:27,982 --> 00:17:32,944
Martin was experiencing and I embodied that character while I was writing him and I tried

267
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:36,946
to figure out what I would do in his situation. So Martin's afraid of a ghost.

268
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:41,127
And what I would do in that situation is I would like Google it.

269
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:43,189
I'd be like, is there a ghost?

270
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:47,133
And then every every positive piece of information that lined up

271
00:17:47,913 --> 00:17:50,876
to what I was experiencing, I'd be like, yeah, there is a ghost.

272
00:17:51,517 --> 00:17:54,820
So in the game, Martin has all these ghost books and he goes through and reads

273
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,863
and he's like, yeah, I haven't seen a ghost yet, so there must be a ghost

274
00:17:59,644 --> 00:18:01,786
because that's exactly what I would do.

275
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:03,608
Yeah, so I have.

276
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:07,924
We call it illness anxiety disorder or hypochondria.

277
00:18:08,786 --> 00:18:11,191
But every time I find a rare illness,

278
00:18:11,813 --> 00:18:13,035
I go on Google and I'm like,

279
00:18:13,116 --> 00:18:14,479
hmm, yeah, I have a headache.

280
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:20,159
Yeah, that's Martin.

281
00:18:20,699 --> 00:18:24,641
And when I embody a character, I have to think about how to challenge those sorts as well.

282
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:28,884
So the detective, once again, is acting as this straight man that comes in and challenges

283
00:18:28,964 --> 00:18:34,827
and dissects each thought that the character has and that creates that tension and that dialogue.

284
00:18:35,467 --> 00:18:39,329
And that character could fight back, it could dig deeper, it could get offended,

285
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,711
or it could start to agree with the detective.

286
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:45,212
And all of those paths are really interesting and could be quite funny.

287
00:18:47,151 --> 00:18:55,698
Going on to Mo. Mo is very shy. I'm not the most shy person, but I can be quite socially anxious and go into my shell.

288
00:18:56,018 --> 00:19:00,601
So with Mo, I picked an animation that really represents their closed off and shy nature.

289
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:05,305
So Mo's kind of like looking down, not really like looking at the detective in the eye.

290
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:10,309
I think Mo is the character most in the game that embodies the idea of physical comedy,

291
00:19:10,629 --> 00:19:14,432
because it's pretty funny when you talk to Mo and they just immediately close themselves off.

292
00:19:14,992 --> 00:19:17,716
even though they were just happily standing there.

293
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:21,661
And comedians use body language quite often to change the mood of a set

294
00:19:22,101 --> 00:19:25,065
and physical comedy can absolutely set the tone

295
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:29,190
of a character without any dialogue so you're immediately going into this idea

296
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,611
of how this character is going to be.

297
00:19:31,827 --> 00:19:36,070
And Mo was also good to write because I sort of became a matchmaker for Mo.

298
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:40,994
If you haven't played the game, Mo has a little bit of a crush on one of the other characters.

299
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:47,659
So your job is just to go and like, see what dance style that character likes the best,

300
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,863
and come back and tell Mo. And then Mo practices the dance.

301
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:54,625
It's very good. I'm a genius.

302
00:19:57,067 --> 00:20:00,131
But when you write a character that wants to make a little bit embarrassing or a little

303
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:04,897
bit vulnerable, writing the dialogue can be super fun and actually enjoyable to do and

304
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:06,739
that comedy kind of writes itself.

305
00:20:07,881 --> 00:20:11,225
All right, so let's get into some tips and tricks.

306
00:20:11,826 --> 00:20:15,511
These are sort of general bits of advice that don't really neatly fit into the other topics.

307
00:20:17,397 --> 00:20:19,317
The first one I'll go into is pacing.

308
00:20:19,957 --> 00:20:23,498
Because often people that are new to writing comedy or new to doing comedy,

309
00:20:23,998 --> 00:20:26,419
really struggle with pacing because they don't give

310
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:29,239
their audience time to breathe after each joke,

311
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:31,080
and your players need to laugh,

312
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,900
and it is quite difficult to get right.

313
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,901
So we weren't using voice acting in our game, it's all text-based.

314
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:42,702
So I was reliant on the text box timings to get the jokes across.

315
00:20:43,183 --> 00:20:46,743
One trick that I learned was just to use ellipses to put

316
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:52,146
beats into your writing. Often when let's players are doing it, you can see it really

317
00:20:52,226 --> 00:20:55,807
clearly if people are streaming the game because they're reading out the dialogue and you can

318
00:20:55,887 --> 00:21:01,309
see where they're pausing to laugh or pausing to let a joke settle in. And it's also when

319
00:21:01,389 --> 00:21:06,151
people are reading, they're doing the same thing. So, good stand-ups kind of do that

320
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:10,333
as well. So, after they pause after making a joke to be like, hey, this is a joke, you

321
00:21:10,373 --> 00:21:15,495
should totally laugh now. And it can also be good for adding awkwardness or sort of

322
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:15,695
like.

323
00:21:16,452 --> 00:21:17,493
ending in non-sequitur.

324
00:21:19,253 --> 00:21:20,453
But you don't have to use ellipses.

325
00:21:20,473 --> 00:21:23,514
You can manufacture this pacing with text box animations

326
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:26,175
or character facial expressions or even camera angles.

327
00:21:26,895 --> 00:21:28,936
I think an example of a game that does this really well

328
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,097
is Breath of the Wild, because when you're talking to people,

329
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:32,457
they aren't speaking to you.

330
00:21:32,497 --> 00:21:35,178
But there's all these different character animations

331
00:21:35,218 --> 00:21:36,458
that really sell that comedy.

332
00:21:36,478 --> 00:21:40,339
Yeah, and you can use these techniques

333
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,620
to change the pace as well.

334
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,300
So look at games that you find funny,

335
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,801
and you can just copy their pacing

336
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:46,141
if you're feeling unsure.

337
00:21:47,829 --> 00:21:51,412
The other big advice I'd give with pacing is if you're struggling with it, just take

338
00:21:51,472 --> 00:21:53,493
a break and leave the dialogue for a while.

339
00:21:53,533 --> 00:21:57,376
I do this pretty often when I'm writing because I'm never sure whether a joke is actually

340
00:21:57,456 --> 00:21:59,438
landing because I've been looking at it for too long.

341
00:21:59,478 --> 00:22:03,881
So leave the dialogue for a while and maybe come back an hour later and play the game

342
00:22:03,901 --> 00:22:08,184
and then you'll read it with a new, like with a set of fresh eyes and see whether, you know,

343
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:11,607
the pacing is off or actually the joke is totally fine and you were just like in your

344
00:22:11,627 --> 00:22:12,207
head too much.

345
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:15,209
Structure.

346
00:22:15,855 --> 00:22:22,580
Okay, so when making short games, I'm of the opinion that you should try to stick to one

347
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:29,084
style of humour if you can. Just one that works for you because when you're doing games, adding

348
00:22:29,125 --> 00:22:34,548
a whole bunch of different styles of humour can be a little bit confusing because the player might

349
00:22:34,608 --> 00:22:42,474
not know whether this is a joke or whether this is like just dialogue. And what I did was with

350
00:22:42,534 --> 00:22:44,395
my sense of humour, like I made sure to signal.

351
00:22:45,387 --> 00:22:48,789
it during the marketing and during the promo work and the people that weren't into that

352
00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:50,931
style of humor could stay away because they can see it.

353
00:22:50,991 --> 00:22:53,553
They can see it outlined before they buy the game.

354
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:58,437
And I think part of the reason that Frog Detective was successful was because I spent a lot of

355
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,099
time signaling the humor in the marketing and the trailers.

356
00:23:01,479 --> 00:23:03,120
So be very clear about what you're doing.

357
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,803
And for bigger games, you can have a mix of different humor styles.

358
00:23:07,724 --> 00:23:11,485
A good talk about that is Zach Johnson's GDC talk about Wests of Loathing.

359
00:23:12,345 --> 00:23:15,806
They made a big game and they could jam pack jokes into it.

360
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:24,549
Another good tip is structuring jokes that fit with your game style.

361
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:27,830
I don't know if game style is a thing, but we'll just go with it.

362
00:23:28,716 --> 00:23:33,360
So my game is expirational, so I structured jokes that could have a payoff regardless

363
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:35,902
of the order that the player sees it in.

364
00:23:36,663 --> 00:23:44,290
So, for example, there is a little note on the notice board in the Haunted Island that

365
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,751
says, where are my sunglasses?

366
00:23:45,831 --> 00:23:46,692
Please give them back.

367
00:23:47,352 --> 00:23:52,137
And then you can find a tiny picture of me with sunglasses on because I have stolen them.

368
00:23:53,157 --> 00:23:55,620
And that joke is probably only funny to me, but it's fine.

369
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:01,992
And I guess, yeah, more linear games can play with structure a lot more freely.

370
00:24:02,072 --> 00:24:07,576
So think of Night in the Woods, I think that's a great example of jokes having a payoff much

371
00:24:07,636 --> 00:24:08,076
later on.

372
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:11,398
Because it is a larger game, you can pace out those jokes.

373
00:24:12,878 --> 00:24:17,861
But with smaller games, like, you do want to kind of make it more punchy and you don't

374
00:24:17,901 --> 00:24:19,422
need callbacks as much, I think.

375
00:24:20,683 --> 00:24:23,684
So my last tip and trick is playtesting.

376
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:25,125
I'm really sorry.

377
00:24:28,642 --> 00:24:31,505
So everyone's favourite part of development is playtesting.

378
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:42,836
So, yeah, the one thing that I learnt from watching really, really terrible comedians

379
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:46,439
is that a lot of people don't test their jokes out before they go on stage.

380
00:24:46,499 --> 00:24:50,543
So treat your dialogue like you're an actually good standup comedian

381
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:52,025
and make sure that you workshop it.

382
00:24:53,446 --> 00:24:58,689
test it out with your players and making things that are funny takes work and not every joke

383
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:00,630
will land and that's absolutely fine.

384
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:05,573
With The Haunted Island I had to go back a lot and change a lot of jokes because not

385
00:25:05,613 --> 00:25:11,436
every joke works on every person but I wanted to have as high a success rate as possible

386
00:25:11,537 --> 00:25:15,439
so I was trying to get jokes in there that were more universally funny.

387
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:18,401
which can be a little bit difficult.

388
00:25:19,081 --> 00:25:20,682
One tip I'd give you with playtesting

389
00:25:20,762 --> 00:25:23,282
is that some people are really uncomfortable being vocal

390
00:25:23,302 --> 00:25:24,362
when they're playing comedy games,

391
00:25:24,382 --> 00:25:26,503
so they don't really wanna laugh out loud.

392
00:25:26,563 --> 00:25:28,543
So when you're playtesting, try and sit in a position

393
00:25:28,583 --> 00:25:30,304
where you can gauge their facial expression.

394
00:25:31,304 --> 00:25:33,224
Because I've had silent playtests

395
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:35,645
where the person, I can't see their face,

396
00:25:35,765 --> 00:25:37,465
and they're just playing the game for an hour,

397
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:38,965
and then they're like, that was good, thank you.

398
00:25:39,485 --> 00:25:42,426
And I have no idea if they actually liked it.

399
00:25:42,746 --> 00:25:44,926
But at the same time, I've had silent playtests

400
00:25:45,046 --> 00:25:45,326
where...

401
00:25:46,902 --> 00:25:51,605
the person, I can see their face and they're smiling or quietly giggling and you know that

402
00:25:51,645 --> 00:25:52,166
that's good.

403
00:25:53,227 --> 00:25:57,550
So if your first playtester doesn't get a joke, that's absolutely fine, just try it

404
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:58,391
on another person.

405
00:25:59,111 --> 00:26:03,275
And if there's still no reaction, try and restructure that joke or change the pacing

406
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:04,856
of it and then try it on another person.

407
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:09,760
If it's still not working, just scrap it because it's not worth it to disrupt that flow.

408
00:26:13,683 --> 00:26:16,924
Wow, yeah, once again, really sorry about this picture.

409
00:26:18,225 --> 00:26:19,705
Like, it's supposed to be Seinfeld.

410
00:26:22,006 --> 00:26:24,387
Turns out Seinfeld doesn't have a really iconic body.

411
00:26:26,308 --> 00:26:29,049
So it just looks like a weird, anyway.

412
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,471
Alright, talk done.

413
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:37,172
Highlight of GDC, thanks for coming.

414
00:26:37,192 --> 00:26:42,254
Yeah, alright, yeah, you can ask me questions if you want.

415
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,580
Oh, you've got to go up to the microphones to ask questions.

416
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,661
That is something that I forgot to mention.

417
00:27:01,562 --> 00:27:01,702
Hello.

418
00:27:01,722 --> 00:27:02,502
I guess I'll go first.

419
00:27:02,562 --> 00:27:02,982
Hello.

420
00:27:04,603 --> 00:27:08,704
So you were talking about, I guess, the length of games.

421
00:27:08,744 --> 00:27:10,365
Something I'm noticing with my game

422
00:27:10,385 --> 00:27:12,066
right now is that people are just hammering

423
00:27:12,146 --> 00:27:13,786
through dialogue a lot.

424
00:27:16,387 --> 00:27:21,529
Do you have any tips on how to engage people with the dialogue

425
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:23,530
when you have a narrative-heavy game?

426
00:27:24,962 --> 00:27:29,406
I think that is tricky and it is something we struggle with a little bit, especially

427
00:27:29,446 --> 00:27:33,810
with younger players who don't want to go through a bunch of jokes that are too old

428
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,070
for them.

429
00:27:36,293 --> 00:27:41,035
Something that I've been thinking about with this next game is actually to have two different

430
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:42,856
dialogue options.

431
00:27:43,116 --> 00:27:46,658
So one for people that don't really like reading and just want all the facts with a little

432
00:27:46,678 --> 00:27:51,781
bit of joke or one dialogue option for everyone that just wants to like go through the game

433
00:27:51,861 --> 00:27:52,401
completely.

434
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:56,403
So signalling that at the start of the game, it is like extra work because you basically

435
00:27:56,423 --> 00:27:58,444
have to go through and redo the scripts twice.

436
00:27:59,084 --> 00:28:02,348
But I think for people that don't like reading games,

437
00:28:02,368 --> 00:28:05,071
like why make playing a narrative game?

438
00:28:05,672 --> 00:28:06,913
It feels very strange.

439
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:08,895
But yeah, some people don't like reading

440
00:28:08,955 --> 00:28:12,099
and I don't know if I can save those people.

441
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:12,719
It's fine.

442
00:28:16,684 --> 00:28:22,147
Yeah, hey, this is going to come across as kind of a self-owned, but I think a lot of

443
00:28:22,308 --> 00:28:26,470
us feel, at least I think I hope it's more than just me, that sometimes humor is kind

444
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:30,012
of an intrinsic thing and you're funny or you're not or your level of humor is set.

445
00:28:30,272 --> 00:28:32,954
For a lot of other things like drawing, it's like, okay, practice, you get better.

446
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:37,577
So would you say that you can practice humor and jokes and get better at it?

447
00:28:37,637 --> 00:28:40,739
And what are some ways to think about doing that if you think that that's a good thing

448
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:40,959
to do?

449
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:44,991
Yeah, I think like some of it is intrinsic, but there's also this thing of like some people

450
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:51,554
are quite funny, but they don't have the confidence to be funny. So just own everything you say,

451
00:28:51,634 --> 00:28:55,495
even if it's not even funny, like half of the stuff I say isn't funny. But if you pause long

452
00:28:55,535 --> 00:28:59,757
enough, people get uncomfortable and they laugh. Awesome. Thank you.

453
00:29:02,718 --> 00:29:08,721
So the talk was super interesting. And provided that there's a lot of creative direction in

454
00:29:09,301 --> 00:29:10,681
building the humor of a game.

455
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:19,714
What would you do in the situation you had to grow and, for instance, look for writers to follow your creative direction?

456
00:29:20,095 --> 00:29:21,837
How you could? It's two parts.

457
00:29:24,615 --> 00:29:30,582
Look for the best way of finding people that you think can fit into that kind of creative direction and humor.

458
00:29:31,122 --> 00:29:43,355
And what piece of advice would you give in the sense of guiding them in a way of getting them closer to your kind of humor?

459
00:29:43,535 --> 00:29:48,780
Yeah, it's difficult because I guess I've written the whole game myself, but I think

460
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,224
if basically in any situation where you're working with a narrative consultant or someone

461
00:29:53,244 --> 00:29:58,148
that's doing the dialogue you should just ask them to do a sample, like make sure that they

462
00:29:58,288 --> 00:30:03,913
what they know, like how they know how to write things that are funny. Yeah, I guess I don't

463
00:30:03,953 --> 00:30:08,857
know if I can answer that question fully because it is it is just me. Sometimes you can just tell

464
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:10,258
if you're talking to someone with a

465
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,326
your sense of humor is the same as theirs.

466
00:30:13,727 --> 00:30:14,871
So that's, yeah.

467
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:15,493
Okay, thank you.

468
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:23,041
Hi, you mentioned that when writing a lot of your believable characters you focus on

469
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:30,244
Aspects of yourself that could be considered negative traits. I was just wondering how you avoid falling onto

470
00:30:31,224 --> 00:30:39,488
Particularly self-deprecation and jokes of that sort. Yeah. Yeah, it is it can be difficult. I think there's there's a delicate balance between

471
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:42,629
making a character who is

472
00:30:44,666 --> 00:30:49,230
a really negative part of yourself but I think the biggest thing for me is like having a character

473
00:30:49,911 --> 00:30:56,296
who is talking to them be gentle and be kind so it's never like haha you believe that you have

474
00:30:57,097 --> 00:31:00,419
a weird disorder haha it's like oh like

475
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,441
Hi, you know, this doesn't make any sense.

476
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:08,002
But with the detective, I'm sort of challenging that character,

477
00:31:08,042 --> 00:31:10,023
but I'm also doing it in a very kind way

478
00:31:10,463 --> 00:31:13,144
to make sure that the whole game is kind of just

479
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,465
about making the characters feel OK about themselves.

480
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:18,846
So when you have those negative personality traits,

481
00:31:18,866 --> 00:31:20,646
I think for me it's easier because I

482
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:22,567
know that the character that they're talking to

483
00:31:22,627 --> 00:31:24,087
isn't going to be harsh to them about it.

484
00:31:25,735 --> 00:31:28,517
Yeah, I guess I'm not a super self-deprecating person either.

485
00:31:28,537 --> 00:31:30,998
I think it's just like, believe in yourself.

486
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,320
Oh, thank you.

487
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:35,942
Excuse me just one second.

488
00:31:37,223 --> 00:31:38,904
All right, so we're about to wrap up.

489
00:31:38,944 --> 00:31:40,525
So this will be the last question here.

490
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:42,986
But we do have a wrap-up room if you want to use it later.

491
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:50,292
Hi, on the last topic of testing your dialogue,

492
00:31:50,652 --> 00:31:53,714
I was just curious, so do you only test after it's

493
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:56,816
in the game or are you ever just testing written lines?

494
00:31:57,036 --> 00:31:59,057
And if you do, do you have a different approach for that?

495
00:31:59,838 --> 00:32:01,979
So I write all my dialogue in the game itself,

496
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:05,281
so every time I press play, the dialogue will be in there.

497
00:32:05,541 --> 00:32:08,323
I think the best way that I've found to test it

498
00:32:08,423 --> 00:32:12,085
is just to ask Tom, who's the programmer and UX designer,

499
00:32:12,165 --> 00:32:14,026
to just come over and read it through

500
00:32:14,147 --> 00:32:15,187
and see whether he laughs.

501
00:32:16,814 --> 00:32:20,277
Yeah, I think when you're testing it doesn't matter if the game is complete or not.

502
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:23,099
Just have enough dialogue in there that it kind of makes sense.

503
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:30,846
I think it is harder to do tests when you're just looking at a script rather than having

504
00:32:30,886 --> 00:32:32,127
like something visual to look at.

505
00:32:32,407 --> 00:32:35,390
It's kind of harder for your brain to be like, oh, yeah, that's funny.

506
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:35,910
That's a joke.

507
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,230
Yeah.

508
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,632
So try and get it in there if you can.

509
00:32:38,232 --> 00:32:38,472
Thank you.

510
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:40,274
Yeah.

511
00:32:40,434 --> 00:32:42,275
So we can go to the wrap up room, which is in 20...

512
00:32:43,956 --> 00:32:48,187
18 I think, if anyone wants to hang out. Otherwise, thank you for coming.
