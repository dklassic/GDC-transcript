1
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:07,317
Hi, thank you all for coming.

2
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:11,799
So before we begin, there are a few official GDC announcements,

3
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:14,941
one of which is to please put your phones on vibrate

4
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:16,942
unless you have an awesome ringtone, in which case,

5
00:00:17,022 --> 00:00:18,683
turn it up as loud as you can.

6
00:00:18,743 --> 00:00:19,543
We want to enjoy it.

7
00:00:21,524 --> 00:00:25,526
The second is that there are speaker session evaluations

8
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:28,648
that have been emailed to you via your badge,

9
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:31,910
and we ask that you please fill those out.

10
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:37,365
So now that that's done, and Richard's sort of already

11
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:38,826
introduced me, so this might be redundant.

12
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:41,387
My name is CJ Kirshner.

13
00:00:41,487 --> 00:00:44,808
I'm a freelance writer, designer, and the head of

14
00:00:44,848 --> 00:00:45,829
Polyhedron Productions.

15
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:49,691
And the talk is The Lives of Others, How NPCs Can Increase

16
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:50,231
Player Empathy.

17
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:52,792
And I ask you to forgive in advance my nervousness.

18
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:54,473
This is my first time speaking at GDC.

19
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:55,833
And there's very little.

20
00:00:57,419 --> 00:01:00,623
There is very little that you can do to prepare yourself to

21
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:03,006
stand up in front of a room of your peers and make a total fool

22
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:09,894
of yourself. So... Yesterday, Meg Giant, the writer on 80 Days

23
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:12,978
gave a fabulous talk called Forget Protagonists. How many of

24
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:16,081
you were there for that? That's a good...

25
00:01:16,856 --> 00:01:21,359
representation. If you missed it, it's now in the past. So I

26
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:24,581
can't recommend that you go to it, but I can recommend that you

27
00:01:24,761 --> 00:01:27,343
check it out when it's available on the vault. I'm told that will

28
00:01:27,383 --> 00:01:33,046
happen in a few weeks. To quote Spaceballs, when will then be

29
00:01:33,106 --> 00:01:43,373
now? Soon. So let's get started. Chapter 1. I am born. Whether I

30
00:01:43,393 --> 00:01:45,354
shall turn out to be the hero of my own life.

31
00:01:45,861 --> 00:01:48,083
or whether that station will be held by anybody else,

32
00:01:48,803 --> 00:01:49,904
these pages must show.

33
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:53,787
That's the first sentence of Charles Dickens' 1850 novel

34
00:01:53,807 --> 00:01:54,607
David Copperfield.

35
00:01:55,508 --> 00:01:57,610
Now, I hope we all have enough self-esteem

36
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,571
to confidently say that we are the heroes

37
00:01:59,611 --> 00:02:00,932
and heroines of our own lives.

38
00:02:01,713 --> 00:02:03,094
But what about everybody else we encounter?

39
00:02:05,135 --> 00:02:06,416
This thought most often strikes me

40
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:08,818
while traveling or riding public transit.

41
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:11,360
I'm so focused on where I need to be and what I need to do

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,922
that everyone else becomes part of the background.

43
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:17,253
But I imagine that's true of my fellow passengers as well.

44
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:20,975
They all have a goal, destination, complex emotions,

45
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:21,836
and social networks.

46
00:02:22,456 --> 00:02:24,777
In short, they have their own views on life, the universe,

47
00:02:24,857 --> 00:02:25,477
and everything.

48
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:27,978
But from this first-person perspective,

49
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,219
I'm the hero of my life.

50
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,279
I'm the main character.

51
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,080
I'm the player.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,981
Which makes them my non-player characters?

53
00:02:35,802 --> 00:02:36,963
And that's what I want to talk about today,

54
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:37,743
the lives of others.

55
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:40,164
I want to look at the ways that we can better recognize

56
00:02:40,284 --> 00:02:43,566
and respect the NPCs who populate the worlds we create.

57
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,893
I want to discuss how we can give their lives and their

58
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:49,656
deaths meaning beyond basic gameplay or background

59
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:53,060
decoration. Because I strongly believe that when production

60
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,524
teams invest in robust NPC characterization, the result is

61
00:02:56,664 --> 00:02:58,666
often increased player engagement and empathy.

62
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:03,539
I want to focus on three ways we can go about bringing more life to randomly generated characters.

63
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:08,404
The first concerns ways that we rally our production to the call of more NPC-focused content.

64
00:03:09,045 --> 00:03:12,428
The second are techniques that my colleagues and I have employed in the past

65
00:03:13,089 --> 00:03:15,111
to bring characterization to those NPCs.

66
00:03:16,052 --> 00:03:19,855
And the last details with the somewhat touchy subject of how we treat the enemies

67
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:22,618
in our games and that our players encounter.

68
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:28,740
I'm going to draw heavily on my work from the Homefront games and titles I worked on during my four years at Ubisoft Montreal.

69
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:37,365
Now, over the course of my career, I've been fortunate to be able to explore the narrative value of traditionally undervalued characters and systems.

70
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:42,249
Or to put that another way, I'm usually the guy who gets stuck with the shit job of writing barks.

71
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:47,475
versus the seemingly more prestigious role of working on the main campaign.

72
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,458
But here's the thing, the barks are just as important, in some cases more so, than the main story.

73
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:56,380
If you consider that a 60-hour open world game with an hour of cut scenes,

74
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,702
the player spends just over 1% of their total playtime watching those scenes.

75
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,503
Now, granted, they're a captive audience, unless there's a...

76
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,081
Don't even get me started on that.

77
00:04:06,982 --> 00:04:09,003
But the majority of the experience is spent outside

78
00:04:09,023 --> 00:04:12,084
of those sequences, despite them commanding a large percentage

79
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,106
of the development's budget and attention.

80
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:19,188
And before we go any further, I wanna just throw out

81
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,009
a couple of quick caveats.

82
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:22,230
Most of my experience has been in big budget,

83
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,331
large team, open world games.

84
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:27,753
So a lot of the production methodologies I'm going to

85
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:30,335
describe are taken from and best suited for those games.

86
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:34,076
But I believe that the high-level takeaways are more

87
00:04:34,116 --> 00:04:37,099
generally applicable to projects of any size. It's about what

88
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:39,941
you're trying to achieve with the resources that you have. And

89
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:43,904
second, people play games for a variety of reasons. And it

90
00:04:43,964 --> 00:04:48,088
helps to accept up front that a percentage of them might not

91
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:50,710
notice or care about the extra effort that you're about to put

92
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,512
in. But you do need to care, and you need to care deeply,

93
00:04:53,552 --> 00:04:56,875
because otherwise nobody else will. Tron fights for the user,

94
00:04:56,895 --> 00:04:58,736
but we should fight for a bit as well.

95
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:07,847
So, okay, the first thing we need to do is get the writers and the rest of the team on board with the idea that NPCs should be an integral part of the game's world.

96
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:13,855
And the good news is that we can leverage a lot of pre-existing systems to make better systemic characters.

97
00:05:15,803 --> 00:05:18,704
On Far Cry 4 we had the benefit of building off of the systems

98
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:21,046
developed for Far Cry 3, but the world of Karat is more

99
00:05:21,066 --> 00:05:23,667
narratively dense and interwoven than the Rook Islands.

100
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:26,149
And additionally, there were technical complications that

101
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:30,811
shipped in Far Cry 3 that prevented or resulted in only a

102
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:34,213
limited number of barks ever playing, which is why everybody

103
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:37,715
is so familiar with the urinary problems of the pirates on that

104
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:42,838
island. Resolving that bug was one of our first tasks for the

105
00:05:42,898 --> 00:05:43,378
AI team.

106
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,771
once that was done, the writing team, narrative team, could get

107
00:05:47,871 --> 00:05:52,232
on the process of planning how we wanted to build upon the

108
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:56,593
systems that we'd previously established. But even with that

109
00:05:56,613 --> 00:06:01,234
advantage, the current tools and design best practices mean that

110
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:05,434
the way that we build a living, breathing, systemic, plausible

111
00:06:05,554 --> 00:06:08,395
open world is simply by throwing a lot of shitload of words into

112
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,155
a database. Um...

113
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,541
So for example, it was reported in Game Informer

114
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:14,362
that Dragon Age Origins, released in 2009,

115
00:06:15,563 --> 00:06:18,244
shipped with roughly 62,000 lines of dialogue

116
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:18,965
for their characters.

117
00:06:19,685 --> 00:06:21,546
And Grand Theft Auto, which was released a year,

118
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,507
Grand Theft Auto 4, which was released a year earlier,

119
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:27,249
had, just look at it, it's three New York City phone books

120
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,990
stacked one on top of the other.

121
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,212
And those are for games that came out almost five years ago.

122
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:39,215
Oh, I have a technical complication here, sorry.

123
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:41,619
There we go.

124
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:44,740
So with nearly yearly release cycles and companies

125
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,961
competing for player attention, the expectation

126
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:49,942
is that each new game needs to be bigger and better

127
00:06:50,463 --> 00:06:51,643
than the one that came before it.

128
00:06:52,183 --> 00:06:54,724
And the content requirements have just continued to grow.

129
00:06:55,384 --> 00:06:58,105
Far Cry 4 shipped with about 20,000 unique barks,

130
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,586
roughly 2,000 printed pages.

131
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:03,688
And Assassin's Creed Syndicate had about 300 crowd vignettes

132
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:05,368
with between one and six actors each.

133
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:09,971
and sometimes lasting up to four and a half minutes.

134
00:07:10,732 --> 00:07:12,293
And those numbers don't reflect the entire game.

135
00:07:12,313 --> 00:07:14,534
Those are just those specific subsystems.

136
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:16,536
Pardon me for a moment.

137
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:20,799
Didn't spill it on myself.

138
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,441
We're off to a good start.

139
00:07:24,262 --> 00:07:25,463
So that's a lot of words.

140
00:07:26,324 --> 00:07:28,565
And if you're working on a game of comparable scale,

141
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:31,027
it's highly advisable to have a team of writers

142
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:33,249
dedicated to the systemic narrative content

143
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:34,670
rather than keeping it in a big pool

144
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:36,812
that writers can pull from as they become available.

145
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:42,109
But you're going to need the involvement of more than just the writers, because storytelling in games is a team sport.

146
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:50,292
The narrative team should drive high-level discussions with the producers, designers, AI programmers, the sound department, casting director, animators, localization,

147
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:56,134
as early as possible in the project's lifespan, and ideally when it's still in conception,

148
00:07:58,195 --> 00:08:01,796
to determine what truths you want the NPCs to convey about your world.

149
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,053
how the different disciplines can contribute to and support this initiative,

150
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:08,734
and to build a production plan,

151
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:12,977
and that includes budget, deliverable dates, and recording schedules,

152
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:16,620
that accommodates this increased writing time and content.

153
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,382
This is an opportunity for you to get a head start on the situation

154
00:08:20,422 --> 00:08:21,323
and build from the ground up,

155
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:23,764
rather than sort of have it imposed upon you from the top down.

156
00:08:26,605 --> 00:08:29,827
Now common wisdom dictates that when faced with the sheer volume of barks

157
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:34,750
to write generic neutral lines that players don't notice if they hear

158
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,752
the same thing fifty times in as many hours

159
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:41,634
and productions sometimes cut corners by asking their NPC actors

160
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:45,256
to read from a bank of the same lines so that the voice rather than the line

161
00:08:45,296 --> 00:08:46,656
itself provides the variation.

162
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:51,088
One of the techniques that we used that not only simplified the writing process,

163
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:55,470
but also brought more color to the NPCs was the creation of micro-personalities.

164
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,531
Each NPC was given a very brief character profile

165
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:03,374
that we could refer to while struggling to write the 10th variation of any given topic.

166
00:09:04,414 --> 00:09:06,175
And these were generally pretty broad attributes.

167
00:09:08,236 --> 00:09:10,477
things like personality types, are they aggressive,

168
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,999
are they a little bit more timid, are they confident?

169
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,821
But there were very specific attributes as well,

170
00:09:15,861 --> 00:09:17,502
like the details of their family life

171
00:09:17,582 --> 00:09:18,483
or their favorite food.

172
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:20,064
Do they have siblings, are they married,

173
00:09:20,084 --> 00:09:20,724
do they have children?

174
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:23,746
Did my slide just advance itself?

175
00:09:25,027 --> 00:09:25,747
Do I have a mouse?

176
00:09:26,808 --> 00:09:27,308
Oh God!

177
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:31,391
All right, we're off the rails now.

178
00:09:33,592 --> 00:09:34,393
So it should also be noted.

179
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:38,991
that under the Far Cry model, barks are broadly divided into

180
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,632
two categories, combats and idles. The combat lines cover

181
00:09:41,692 --> 00:09:45,773
everything from the genre standard reloading to individual

182
00:09:45,813 --> 00:09:49,914
and squad tactics, search loops, and damage and death states. The

183
00:09:50,034 --> 00:09:53,755
idles are just that, the things that they say when they're

184
00:09:53,915 --> 00:09:56,655
standing around doing nothing, not in combat, not even

185
00:09:56,835 --> 00:10:01,777
detected. So in Barking on 4 we established a broader range of

186
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:07,161
conversation topics for the idols like war.

187
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:10,424
I'm going to try and scroll my notes here and it may just go...

188
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:12,246
Anyway, more conversations.

189
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:17,831
Conversation topics like the course of the war,

190
00:10:18,872 --> 00:10:20,874
food, their family,

191
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:25,839
their equipment, and even things like rain or night time.

192
00:10:27,704 --> 00:10:28,745
And midway through the production,

193
00:10:29,065 --> 00:10:31,187
the system was modified to introduce a call and response

194
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:31,607
system.

195
00:10:31,668 --> 00:10:34,190
So NPC A would randomly choose one of those categories

196
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,872
and play one of the lines that we've written.

197
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:39,295
And then NPC B would respond in kind.

198
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:41,489
Now, had we planned this from the start,

199
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:42,950
it might have spared us the shock

200
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,411
of having to write a few thousand new response lines.

201
00:10:45,431 --> 00:10:47,753
But fortunately, we set up a system

202
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,115
of informal weekly reviews with the sound and AI teams

203
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:55,098
so that we would load up either a test map or the latest

204
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:57,479
version of the build and poke the systems,

205
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,461
try and introduce the stimuli to get the lines

206
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:00,962
that we wanted to fire, to find out

207
00:11:00,982 --> 00:11:03,403
if they were working properly, to find out if the responses

208
00:11:03,464 --> 00:11:04,264
matched the calls.

209
00:11:05,105 --> 00:11:09,207
And the slides now go off again.

210
00:11:09,488 --> 00:11:09,768
Whatever.

211
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:11,238
F it.

212
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,064
The benefit was that by the end, any of our characters

213
00:11:17,105 --> 00:11:19,287
could have a short systemically assembled conversation

214
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:20,609
on a variety of topics.

215
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:23,011
And it allowed us to communicate more about the world

216
00:11:23,072 --> 00:11:25,474
through them and for them to reveal their personalities

217
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:27,937
to the player when the player was just hanging around.

218
00:11:28,845 --> 00:11:31,427
By assigning each NPC a unique voice and a set of character

219
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:34,110
traits in combination with hiring native language speaking

220
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:36,913
voice actors, we were able to create more well-rounded

221
00:11:36,973 --> 00:11:39,755
characters that players actually wanted to hang around and

222
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:40,196
listen to.

223
00:11:40,276 --> 00:11:43,379
Or maybe they didn't mind the occasional repetition if it

224
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:47,042
would reveal another line later that gave more information

225
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:47,803
about that character.

226
00:11:48,564 --> 00:11:50,145
And occasionally, the irreverent response

227
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,247
garnered a chuckle.

228
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,055
And given the range of topics that NPCs could speak about,

229
00:11:56,595 --> 00:11:59,097
any one of them could have been the player character

230
00:11:59,157 --> 00:12:00,538
in a different version of the game.

231
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:03,720
When they boasted about finding a new weapon site

232
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,361
or where their allegiances with the factions lay,

233
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:09,303
their thoughts echoed those of the player.

234
00:12:10,424 --> 00:12:14,266
So we made sure that everybody had something to talk about

235
00:12:14,306 --> 00:12:15,167
while they were standing around,

236
00:12:15,227 --> 00:12:16,988
and hopefully that those things were worth listening to,

237
00:12:17,468 --> 00:12:19,670
but also by respecting that,

238
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:21,551
we realized that...

239
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:25,909
Any one of them could have been you in another life.

240
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:30,933
So you've decided you want to expand the scope

241
00:12:30,953 --> 00:12:32,935
of your NPC content, you've specced out a system

242
00:12:33,215 --> 00:12:34,156
for how the dialogue will play,

243
00:12:34,176 --> 00:12:36,297
and you've built a production plan with your team

244
00:12:36,337 --> 00:12:37,538
to allow for the additional writing,

245
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:38,459
recording, and reviewing.

246
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,561
The next step is to determine what you want your NPCs

247
00:12:41,581 --> 00:12:43,983
to say, how they will act, and what their presence

248
00:12:44,023 --> 00:12:44,824
in the game should mean.

249
00:12:45,805 --> 00:12:47,846
In narrative and design, we lay sacrifices

250
00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:49,067
on the altar of player agency,

251
00:12:49,107 --> 00:12:51,309
but rarely do we ever talk about non-player agency.

252
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,506
Their function is to simply spawn, wander around, play some lines or animations,

253
00:12:56,546 --> 00:12:59,169
and then die or despawn as soon as the player is out of range.

254
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:02,333
But if we want to build compelling characters from the common mobs,

255
00:13:02,794 --> 00:13:06,319
each one of them should be invested in their own life and the outcome of their actions.

256
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:10,304
They should have wants, needs, desires, as well as the means to attain those things.

257
00:13:13,737 --> 00:13:15,337
One of my favorite pieces of writing advice

258
00:13:15,397 --> 00:13:16,497
comes from Kurt Vonnegut, who said,

259
00:13:17,017 --> 00:13:18,518
every character should want something,

260
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:20,618
even if it is only a glass of water.

261
00:13:21,179 --> 00:13:22,999
So let's assume the player's needs are well taken care of,

262
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:24,660
either through the objectives that we give them

263
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,200
or the ones that they set for themselves.

264
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,141
Part of the benefit of creating the micro-personalities,

265
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:32,822
each character's wants was at the top of that list

266
00:13:32,862 --> 00:13:35,703
and everything else that followed was filtered through that.

267
00:13:37,103 --> 00:13:38,623
These can be simple or complicated.

268
00:13:39,415 --> 00:13:44,559
And we should find ways to communicate them to the player, even if it's an on-the-nose, outright line.

269
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:47,081
It's not the most elegant way, but it is fast and effective.

270
00:13:48,022 --> 00:13:51,985
And beyond those wants, we should ask whether or not their basic needs are being met.

271
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:54,908
I mean, not as victims, but as characters worthy of dignity.

272
00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:00,852
Vonnegut's quote is doubly salient when we consider that one in ten people in the world

273
00:14:00,993 --> 00:14:05,256
don't have access to safe water, or that between 6,000 and 12,000 children in Flint, Michigan

274
00:14:05,616 --> 00:14:08,739
have been potentially affected by the lead crisis there.

275
00:14:09,977 --> 00:14:15,739
Resource scarcity plays a large role in the home front games, both of which are set in an occupied post-collapse America.

276
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:19,060
The backstories tend to focus on the availability of cheap oil,

277
00:14:19,921 --> 00:14:23,442
but the NPCs often talk about and work towards access to clean water,

278
00:14:23,602 --> 00:14:28,104
and rainwater collection systems form a core component of our environmental storytelling.

279
00:14:29,344 --> 00:14:31,385
But beyond just a glass of water, which...

280
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:39,951
Beyond water, we all want different things,

281
00:14:39,991 --> 00:14:41,412
and they can be tangible or not.

282
00:14:42,552 --> 00:14:45,493
So determine what goals are important to your NPCs

283
00:14:45,533 --> 00:14:47,913
and what tools you've designed to give them

284
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:49,394
agency to pursue them.

285
00:14:49,414 --> 00:14:51,474
And if you haven't, perhaps ask why not.

286
00:14:53,615 --> 00:14:55,535
When I talk about giving NPCs agency and the means

287
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:56,655
to fulfill their wants and needs,

288
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:59,876
I find that the current designs underserve these characters.

289
00:15:00,656 --> 00:15:02,277
The player who is typically an outsider

290
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:04,637
has far more means to pursue goals and effect change

291
00:15:04,657 --> 00:15:06,438
in the world than those who actually live there.

292
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,401
And the task of giving NPCs this agency

293
00:15:09,461 --> 00:15:11,122
is no small technical undertaking,

294
00:15:11,663 --> 00:15:13,104
but I believe it's one we'll need to meet

295
00:15:13,264 --> 00:15:15,365
if we're to continue to make games the way that we do.

296
00:15:16,406 --> 00:15:18,187
Today's talk mostly focuses on bringing

297
00:15:18,227 --> 00:15:20,329
the illusion of agency through dialogue

298
00:15:20,349 --> 00:15:21,249
and other narrative content,

299
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,692
but there is another avenue that merits investigation,

300
00:15:24,772 --> 00:15:26,393
and that is deeper social simulations.

301
00:15:28,034 --> 00:15:29,975
I don't see the approaches as being mutually exclusive.

302
00:15:30,015 --> 00:15:31,356
I think they exist on a spectrum

303
00:15:31,536 --> 00:15:35,679
and can and should work in complement with each other.

304
00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:42,896
I'm a writer and not much of a programmer, so I'm not very qualified to speak about the social simulation side.

305
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:47,900
However, Mitu Kandekar-Kokoris at last year's GDC gave an excellent talk,

306
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:52,885
and that is available on the vault, about her work and research in social simulations for games.

307
00:15:57,387 --> 00:15:59,309
But even with my limited technical understanding,

308
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:01,531
in the future, I can see the potential for layers of AI

309
00:16:01,651 --> 00:16:04,614
running on top of a game which provides goals and directions

310
00:16:04,654 --> 00:16:07,116
and schedules for every NPC in the world.

311
00:16:07,837 --> 00:16:08,998
Our NPC should be able to perform

312
00:16:09,018 --> 00:16:11,720
the same range of actions that are available to the player,

313
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,162
as well as have the ability to embark on quests or activities

314
00:16:14,202 --> 00:16:15,683
without the player's prompting or presence.

315
00:16:16,424 --> 00:16:18,086
Not dissimilar from the way that computer opponents

316
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:21,869
in a game of civilization choose strategies and make moves,

317
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:23,310
even when obscured by the fog of war.

318
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:26,452
Now, I'm not suggesting these needs need to overlap

319
00:16:26,893 --> 00:16:28,654
with the player's goals, but they can instead

320
00:16:28,694 --> 00:16:31,495
operate alongside and create a richer living world, one

321
00:16:31,515 --> 00:16:33,356
in which the player can remain a central figure,

322
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:35,178
but that follows its own schedule.

323
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:38,760
For example, why is it in a game like Grand Theft Auto V,

324
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,881
the only time I ever see an illegal street race

325
00:16:41,241 --> 00:16:43,082
is when I've agreed to do one myself?

326
00:16:45,444 --> 00:16:46,824
There's one other thing I want to talk about,

327
00:16:46,844 --> 00:16:48,625
and it's a corollary to all of this.

328
00:16:49,026 --> 00:16:50,327
But in terms of character building,

329
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:52,168
I want to talk about possessions.

330
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:59,260
Tim O'Brien's book, The Things They Carried, is a great resource for writers who are looking to bring

331
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,822
personality to characters through everyday objects because each of us carries on us

332
00:17:04,742 --> 00:17:09,665
certain items that say a lot about us. Like if you were to lose your backpack today and

333
00:17:09,705 --> 00:17:14,667
somebody generously were to find it and not scavenge it, what would its contents say about you?

334
00:17:17,228 --> 00:17:20,389
There are a few games with very deep world-centric loots.

335
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,141
Skyrim being a, what does that say about this player?

336
00:17:26,582 --> 00:17:26,742
Um.

337
00:17:29,943 --> 00:17:32,104
Where everyday objects are used to communicate truths

338
00:17:32,124 --> 00:17:33,424
about the characters of the environment.

339
00:17:34,445 --> 00:17:36,005
And it's just one more tool that we can use

340
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:37,886
to bring that life to our NPCs.

341
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:40,527
But many of the current loot systems,

342
00:17:41,748 --> 00:17:43,969
unless there are also mechanics for theft or pickpocketing,

343
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:46,510
rely on a character to, well.

344
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:50,445
be dead before they can be searched, which sort of leads

345
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:54,686
into the next section. I'm going to get a little dark and ranty

346
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:58,207
here, because the subject of killing, death, and enemies in

347
00:17:58,227 --> 00:18:03,648
games is one that I don't think is discussed often enough. When

348
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:05,928
we created the micro personalities for the NPCs in

349
00:18:05,948 --> 00:18:09,509
Far Cry 4 and AC Syndicate, we didn't stop with the friendly or

350
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:12,749
neutral characters. Both of these games feature strong

351
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:14,650
stealth mechanics, so there are a lot of times when the players

352
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,090
will be in proximity to enemies but not engaged in combat.

353
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:21,311
So what do the enemies talk about while they're just standing around?

354
00:18:24,253 --> 00:18:27,395
In the example of Far Cry 4, the gameplay takes place during a fictional civil war,

355
00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:32,599
and like any war, each side and every soldier brings their own motivations to the battlefield.

356
00:18:33,719 --> 00:18:38,182
It's overly simplistic to think that because we're opposed to them, they are necessarily

357
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:38,483
evil.

358
00:18:39,688 --> 00:18:44,869
The micro-personalities allowed us to explore the reasons and emotions that drove the enemy soldiers to do what they did.

359
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,890
Some of the set-piece atrocities were a little outside of our control,

360
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:49,911
but if you hide in a bush for long enough,

361
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:54,993
you might discover that the people that you've been shooting for the past few hours are remarkably sympathetic.

362
00:19:02,948 --> 00:19:05,950
In his book On Killing, Lieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman,

363
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,952
who I don't think is any relation to the game designer of the same name,

364
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:12,834
talks about the techniques the military has developed

365
00:19:12,954 --> 00:19:14,075
to dehumanize the enemy.

366
00:19:14,816 --> 00:19:18,078
Part of this is conditioning designed to desensitize soldiers

367
00:19:18,118 --> 00:19:20,159
and allow them to overcome their innate reluctance

368
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:21,100
to kill another human.

369
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,602
And part of it is a coping mechanism those same soldiers

370
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:28,525
have to deal with the psychological trauma of taking another life.

371
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,182
He writes, oh, I am going to need my notes for this.

372
00:19:32,242 --> 00:19:33,383
How do I make this work?

373
00:19:34,323 --> 00:19:34,604
Nope.

374
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:36,045
Come on.

375
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:40,408
Does anybody know how to advance the notes

376
00:19:40,428 --> 00:19:41,448
section in PowerPoint?

377
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,473
Weird, no.

378
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:48,994
This is all just going to break.

379
00:19:50,415 --> 00:19:51,255
It's so fragile.

380
00:19:57,137 --> 00:20:01,001
He writes that the burden of killing is so great that most try not to admit that they have killed.

381
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,404
They deny it to others and then they deny it to themselves.

382
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:09,069
And he further writes that part of this ability is a function of the language used,

383
00:20:09,489 --> 00:20:11,131
something we call othering.

384
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:15,215
And I would quote, but it is now cut off.

385
00:20:27,272 --> 00:20:37,915
I'm a deer in the headlights now. Basically, we assign other names to our enemy NPCs, we

386
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:45,097
cover their faces, we mask their voices, we create epithets for them and he says that

387
00:20:45,697 --> 00:20:46,678
the language of Met at War is...

388
00:20:47,548 --> 00:20:52,049
In order to facilitate this killing, the enemy is not killed.

389
00:20:52,329 --> 00:20:54,890
They're neutralized, they're greased, they're knocked down.

390
00:20:55,550 --> 00:21:00,091
And it's not a human being you're killing, it's a kraut, it's a Jap, it's somebody else.

391
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:02,032
We do this in games all the time.

392
00:21:02,332 --> 00:21:07,033
We have orcs, we have norks, we have Middle Eastern extremists from Nowaristan.

393
00:21:10,793 --> 00:21:13,554
So why on earth would we want our players to feel bad about shooting people?

394
00:21:13,594 --> 00:21:16,815
I mean, we've worked so hard over the years to make the act of killing fun.

395
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:19,569
I mean, we've perfected the inputs and outputs

396
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:21,810
to enable players to shoot or stab

397
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,591
thousands of human-like figures for hours on end.

398
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:28,392
And we've been successful because we as developers

399
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,253
have refused to accept responsibility for it

400
00:21:30,473 --> 00:21:32,334
and have shielded our players from feeling anything

401
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:34,234
that doesn't also come with a release of dopamine.

402
00:21:35,835 --> 00:21:37,556
At an NYU Game Center lecture in 2009,

403
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:40,237
Warren Spector said, and I'm paraphrasing from my own notes

404
00:21:40,277 --> 00:21:43,618
here, that games excel at the emotions of triumph and guilt,

405
00:21:43,658 --> 00:21:46,159
but only ever really explore the first.

406
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:49,280
It's a very subtle difference between, I did that!

407
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,002
And I did that.

408
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:55,866
And I think guilt is a very powerful emotion.

409
00:21:55,926 --> 00:21:57,187
It's central in theater.

410
00:21:57,407 --> 00:21:59,089
It's a key component of catharsis.

411
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,111
And I want to make a distinction before we go further

412
00:22:02,211 --> 00:22:05,974
between guilt and gotchas, which was a narrative technique that

413
00:22:05,994 --> 00:22:07,656
was in vogue a few years ago.

414
00:22:13,288 --> 00:22:19,053
my notes are cut off, but basically the gotcha is an unwinnable situation that the player needs to

415
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:26,258
complete before they're allowed to progress. And by doing it, often the designers then

416
00:22:26,658 --> 00:22:30,921
condemn that action. And when the player asks, well, what other choice did I have, the

417
00:22:30,961 --> 00:22:35,484
response is usually, you could have taken the disc out and brought it back to the store. I

418
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:39,407
don't think that's necessarily an effective method for getting players to feel things.

419
00:22:41,223 --> 00:22:42,123
Guilt, on the other hand, is something

420
00:22:42,303 --> 00:22:43,743
that players arrive at themselves

421
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:45,484
without the developer needing to pass judgment.

422
00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:48,684
It basically asserts that performing violence

423
00:22:48,704 --> 00:22:50,645
against characters who share an emotional investment

424
00:22:50,685 --> 00:22:52,245
in the outcome of the story will naturally

425
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:55,146
lead players to recognize and take responsibility

426
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:56,686
for the destruction they cause.

427
00:22:56,706 --> 00:22:58,247
It acknowledges that the act of killing

428
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:00,747
is necessarily an act of trauma.

429
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:03,628
In short, it creates empathy.

430
00:23:05,028 --> 00:23:06,468
And that empathy is dissonant with the act.

431
00:23:07,774 --> 00:23:09,235
And we never explore that.

432
00:23:10,136 --> 00:23:11,978
But observation and anecdotal evidence

433
00:23:12,379 --> 00:23:15,022
leads me to believe that this empathy can crack even

434
00:23:15,062 --> 00:23:16,363
the hardest of gaming's hearts.

435
00:23:23,248 --> 00:23:27,150
Rob Otten, one of the writers on Battlefield Hardline, said in an interview with Polygon

436
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,432
about the game's villains, I wrote this one guy getting back together with his ex-girlfriend

437
00:23:30,512 --> 00:23:33,994
and someone on the team pointed out, hey idiot, this is someone you're about to shoot in the

438
00:23:34,074 --> 00:23:35,335
head, not deliver flowers to.

439
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:37,656
So we decided, maybe let's not go down that route.

440
00:23:38,336 --> 00:23:40,638
We had to cut the dialogue and make it more informative.

441
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:43,820
We had to make sure that the bad guys felt like bad guys so the player isn't as emotionally

442
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,060
conflicted about the gameplay.

443
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,505
No disrespect to Rob.

444
00:23:48,266 --> 00:23:49,707
I believe his initial impulse was correct,

445
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,928
just as I believe that whoever asked him to change it

446
00:23:51,968 --> 00:23:54,750
was also operating from our current best understanding

447
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:57,712
of what needs to be done to make a mass market shooter

448
00:23:57,993 --> 00:23:59,173
for a publicly traded company.

449
00:24:00,554 --> 00:24:02,636
But the compromise that was required

450
00:24:02,716 --> 00:24:04,217
speaks to our continued inability

451
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:09,100
to create mature, nuanced work and why

452
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,922
we keep recycling the same action movie tropes.

453
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:15,717
And now that I've brought the entire mood down with all of

454
00:24:15,777 --> 00:24:21,579
this death and destruction, here's a puppy.

455
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,941
It was not a polar bear.

456
00:24:26,981 --> 00:24:27,661
That was totally...

457
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,745
The audience is always right.

458
00:24:37,765 --> 00:24:40,246
My next slide is going to be bagel or dachshund.

459
00:24:42,444 --> 00:24:44,666
So in conclusion for the high-level takeaways,

460
00:24:45,707 --> 00:24:47,969
use your NPCs to tell truths about your world

461
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:50,050
and have a production plan to accommodate

462
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,871
the increased writing.

463
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:53,433
Give them their own personalities and agendas

464
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,676
because players gravitate towards well-developed characters

465
00:24:56,756 --> 00:24:59,678
regardless of whether they're directly in front of them

466
00:24:59,738 --> 00:25:02,060
in a cut scene or whether they're operating independently

467
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,861
in the world around them.

468
00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:05,743
And offer those characters a degree of agency

469
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,885
because they will add life to the world

470
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:09,286
in interesting and emergent ways.

471
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:15,453
Acknowledge the humanity of your enemies, because violence without consequence is meaningless.

472
00:25:17,135 --> 00:25:20,938
And allow players to feel responsible for the actions, because empathy and complex emotions

473
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:22,380
will help this industry to mature.

474
00:25:24,562 --> 00:25:28,465
Special thanks to the people that offered feedback on this talk, even if they couldn't

475
00:25:28,505 --> 00:25:30,187
save me from my own technical gaffes.

476
00:25:31,188 --> 00:25:32,709
And thank you for coming.

477
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:51,632
And I don't know how much time we have, but I think we can take

478
00:25:51,672 --> 00:25:56,116
some questions if there are... Huh? Four minutes. Okay. We can

479
00:25:56,136 --> 00:25:58,257
take four one-minute questions, one four-minute question or two

480
00:25:58,297 --> 00:26:07,145
two-minute questions. Uh, to the polar bear? Yes, of course.

481
00:26:08,971 --> 00:26:09,211
Hi there.

482
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:11,933
From a game design and AI design standpoint,

483
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:16,036
do you have any ideas of things you wish you could convince

484
00:26:16,536 --> 00:26:18,538
the higher-ups to put in the framework

485
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:23,762
to allow you to have more chances to give the AI to be

486
00:26:23,822 --> 00:26:27,084
more, I don't know, empathetic?

487
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:29,886
Well, again, I think we can take a lot of the systems

488
00:26:29,906 --> 00:26:35,370
that we already employ and modify the content in them.

489
00:26:36,031 --> 00:26:38,172
to achieve, again, sort of the illusion of this.

490
00:26:40,373 --> 00:26:44,976
The discussion about how you bring that more robust agency

491
00:26:45,796 --> 00:26:47,717
is, again, a conversation that needs

492
00:26:47,737 --> 00:26:49,978
to happen at a project level with animators,

493
00:26:50,018 --> 00:26:53,140
with designers, because as writers,

494
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,360
we can put the words down.

495
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,801
But anything that we put down creates more work

496
00:26:56,862 --> 00:26:57,702
for other departments.

497
00:26:57,802 --> 00:27:00,343
And so they really need to know.

498
00:27:01,256 --> 00:27:05,359
what we would like to achieve, they need to be on board with that, they need to believe it as strongly as we do.

499
00:27:06,861 --> 00:27:08,562
I think we are making progress toward it

500
00:27:10,264 --> 00:27:11,444
and I hope to see

501
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,327
more games coming out in the future

502
00:27:14,347 --> 00:27:18,650
that offer NPCs that same

503
00:27:19,011 --> 00:27:21,573
degree. Like I want to see an orc war camp

504
00:27:22,153 --> 00:27:23,234
in Shadow of Mordor 2.

505
00:27:24,384 --> 00:27:26,886
where they aren't just there to get cut down,

506
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:29,688
where they go off and have their own orc lives

507
00:27:29,728 --> 00:27:32,890
and orc wives and orc babies, and they sing orc songs.

508
00:27:35,192 --> 00:27:35,492
Thank you.

509
00:27:35,672 --> 00:27:35,932
Thank you.

510
00:27:37,533 --> 00:27:38,254
Hi there.

511
00:27:38,594 --> 00:27:38,834
Hi there.

512
00:27:39,254 --> 00:27:41,356
First thing I wanted to say was this is by far

513
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:42,977
one of the best talks I've listened to so far,

514
00:27:43,037 --> 00:27:44,818
so thank you very much for that.

515
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:45,699
Thank you.

516
00:27:50,100 --> 00:28:02,482
But from an execution standpoint, one of the things I just had a little question about was on Far Cry 4 you were talking about how you wrote kind of dialogue lines centered around war or family or food and how you would have two NPCs talking.

517
00:28:02,582 --> 00:28:12,345
Just from a purely execution case, was that, would that be one NPC pulling from a pool and then another NPC pulling from the same subject matter but not necessarily related but close enough that it would feel organic?

518
00:28:12,885 --> 00:28:14,967
or was it you would have to literally match up two lines,

519
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:16,648
like you would have a call and response, exactly?

520
00:28:17,048 --> 00:28:19,270
So, that's actually a very good question.

521
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,413
The call lines that were about the topics of food

522
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,535
or whatever, you know, you would have something like,

523
00:28:25,695 --> 00:28:26,756
I miss my mother's cooking.

524
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:30,919
Or, you know, my father makes the best naan.

525
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,981
And the response lines were...

526
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:39,070
generally a bit more generic, but again, because we had those micro personalities, we could

527
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:47,155
provide generic responses that would suit the calls reasonably well. So, you know, my

528
00:28:47,195 --> 00:28:51,317
father makes the best naan. Somebody else will just chip in from that same bank of lines

529
00:28:51,357 --> 00:28:54,759
about food or family and say, I haven't eaten in days.

530
00:28:56,607 --> 00:28:59,769
you know, I don't think I've ever actually enjoyed that meal

531
00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:02,211
as much as you have or you know I'm an orphan, right?

532
00:29:03,592 --> 00:29:06,334
Right. So it wasn't specific for that time.

533
00:29:06,354 --> 00:29:08,215
No, no, no. It wasn't like if you play line A,

534
00:29:08,255 --> 00:29:09,877
then you will necessarily play line B.

535
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:11,378
It was if you play one of these ten lines,

536
00:29:11,398 --> 00:29:13,039
then you will play one of these five responses.

537
00:29:13,779 --> 00:29:17,662
And those five responses were generally in the range

538
00:29:17,702 --> 00:29:22,045
of things that would work well with the calls.

539
00:29:22,245 --> 00:29:24,647
Again, it was all found through reviews.

540
00:29:25,773 --> 00:29:27,474
did initially write that one-to-one

541
00:29:28,274 --> 00:29:31,055
and found that the repetition wasn't working

542
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:33,815
and that oftentimes even the responses didn't work.

543
00:29:34,915 --> 00:29:38,516
And so it was by constantly iterating and looking at it

544
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:41,197
and minor course corrections here and there

545
00:29:41,257 --> 00:29:44,138
that we were able to sort of arrive at lines

546
00:29:44,178 --> 00:29:46,258
that were generally applicable

547
00:29:46,298 --> 00:29:47,938
but still functional, flavorful,

548
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:50,199
and tailored to that particular topic.

549
00:29:50,419 --> 00:29:50,979
Okay, thanks a lot.

550
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,600
Hey, Heather.

551
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,346
Um, I like the polar bear, by the way.

552
00:29:57,107 --> 00:29:57,587
It's not a-

553
00:29:57,647 --> 00:29:58,127
I'm going back.

554
00:29:58,147 --> 00:29:58,567
I got it.

555
00:29:58,607 --> 00:29:59,047
I got to know.

556
00:29:59,748 --> 00:30:00,968
Forget, forget to take-

557
00:30:01,568 --> 00:30:02,108
It's a polar bear.

558
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:03,329
It's a tall polar bear.

559
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,990
That's a polar bear.

560
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:06,970
It's a polar bear.

561
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,791
So you were talking about the mini personalities and the call and responses, and sorry, maybe

562
00:30:27,252 --> 00:30:32,514
I didn't hear about it, but I was wondering if you were able to create specific animations

563
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:36,295
to go along with these call and responses, and if you didn't, do you think that would

564
00:30:36,315 --> 00:30:38,716
be something that you would be able to do in future titles?

565
00:30:39,777 --> 00:30:45,779
So with regard to the animations, that was one area where, because the...

566
00:30:47,351 --> 00:30:49,374
operations were happening in parallel. The writing was

567
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,998
happening at the same time they were shooting a lot of the new

568
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:55,303
game play idols. The animation team...

569
00:30:56,419 --> 00:31:00,180
put together a list of things that they wanted, design included things that they wanted, and then

570
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:04,582
we also got to include some things that we wanted, but in terms of like very custom

571
00:31:05,182 --> 00:31:10,624
one-off animations for specific lines of dialogue, I don't think that we necessarily had those,

572
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:16,827
though again if you start early enough in the process it would not be too particularly

573
00:31:18,347 --> 00:31:21,008
not uncomplicated, but you could easily...

574
00:31:22,219 --> 00:31:26,340
include those in the production plan to have people sitting around having a meal,

575
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,042
you know, people trading cigarettes, people doing whatever. Again, it's about

576
00:31:33,062 --> 00:31:37,264
getting on board early and then making your wants and needs known and then

577
00:31:37,304 --> 00:31:42,266
getting the rest of the team on board with them. Okay, great, thanks. I think

578
00:31:42,306 --> 00:31:48,048
that's it. Thank you.
