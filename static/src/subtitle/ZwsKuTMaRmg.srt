1
00:00:05,924 --> 00:00:07,065
All right, hey everybody.

2
00:00:07,505 --> 00:00:08,606
Thanks for coming to our talk.

3
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:09,847
We make ARC.

4
00:00:10,388 --> 00:00:11,949
A lot of us in this room also make ARC.

5
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:13,210
Got some of our team here.

6
00:00:14,271 --> 00:00:15,612
We're gonna be talking to you a little bit

7
00:00:15,632 --> 00:00:17,194
about our journey through early access,

8
00:00:17,534 --> 00:00:19,776
and so let's go ahead and kick it off.

9
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:24,460
I'm Jesse Rapsack, art director, technical art director,

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,683
co-creative director with Jeremy on ARC.

11
00:00:28,323 --> 00:00:30,966
I'm Jeremy Stiglitz, the lead designer,

12
00:00:31,066 --> 00:00:32,667
lead programmer and co-creative director of ARC.

13
00:00:33,707 --> 00:00:40,736
So we'll just start out real quick and get right into it and why we chose to ship our game in early access.

14
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:52,065
You know, Ark is a very large game in terms of scope, gameplay mechanics, and breadth of content,

15
00:00:52,145 --> 00:00:56,648
and we're a small team, only about 25 people or so on the core team,

16
00:00:56,668 --> 00:01:01,993
and it would be very difficult, maybe impossible, for us to really develop such a game

17
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:04,675
without large-scale testing and iteration.

18
00:01:04,695 --> 00:01:08,218
And one of the concepts we've really tried to take farther in Ark than...

19
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:11,029
in other games we've created in the past

20
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:13,630
is the concept of emergent development.

21
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:17,732
And kind of maybe a similar concept to emergent gameplay,

22
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:20,633
where emergent gameplay would be gameplay mechanics

23
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:25,155
you don't necessarily plan for or predict as a designer.

24
00:01:25,175 --> 00:01:27,236
Emergent development is kind of the concept

25
00:01:27,276 --> 00:01:29,176
that we don't know every direction

26
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,797
the arc development process is going to take us.

27
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,979
And those things are kind of determined on the fly

28
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:37,320
based on community feedback and metrics.

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,700
throughout the early access process.

30
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:46,262
So one example of this is really like the

31
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:47,583
creative game play ideas.

32
00:01:48,063 --> 00:01:50,824
We really iterate very heavily with the community on this.

33
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:52,364
If you've ever paid attention to our game,

34
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,725
we've got a very two-way dialogue.

35
00:01:55,205 --> 00:01:59,086
We've got a great body of testers and people that

36
00:01:59,146 --> 00:02:01,247
give us early feedback when we're working on stuff.

37
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:04,327
And we really implement those community suggestions

38
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:05,208
to make the game better.

39
00:02:05,688 --> 00:02:08,510
And that's really a big part we think of being successful

40
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:12,072
in early access is establishing that relationship

41
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:13,132
with your game's community.

42
00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:15,614
And so we'll be talking about that a little bit

43
00:02:15,654 --> 00:02:17,055
during this presentation as well.

44
00:02:17,635 --> 00:02:20,537
To say how we do it and maybe provide some ideas

45
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:22,778
on how you might do the same thing in your title

46
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:23,919
if you're gonna go the same route.

47
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:30,402
The concept of emergent development essentially

48
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:38,036
in our case means that we have a set of guiding first principles that really define whether

49
00:02:38,096 --> 00:02:45,898
something is ARC, but we don't have a specific rigid master design document or master plan

50
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:47,799
that defines all of the gameplay.

51
00:02:48,179 --> 00:02:51,961
features or content that we intend to have from start to finish.

52
00:02:52,601 --> 00:03:01,566
And we essentially leave that to the iterative process of early access to guide the game development

53
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,687
as long as it fits within this first principles framework

54
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:09,610
and then of course a slightly more refined scorecard metric that we're going to go over later.

55
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,671
But I wanted to give you a sense of really what those first principles are.

56
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:14,386
in Ark's case.

57
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:18,269
What we're gonna do is walk through the original pitch

58
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:20,631
document for Ark, and this is effectively all that we have

59
00:03:20,731 --> 00:03:24,393
as a design document for the game, master design document.

60
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:28,476
And essentially, we don't do anything in Ark

61
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:32,298
that would contradict this principles design document.

62
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:36,121
But this document is not necessarily a blueprint

63
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:38,022
for everything that goes in the game.

64
00:03:38,062 --> 00:03:40,924
So don't contradict, but otherwise anything

65
00:03:40,944 --> 00:03:43,186
that doesn't contradict is fair game.

66
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:48,371
That's pretty much what I just described.

67
00:03:50,413 --> 00:03:53,015
So this is the original design document that we generated

68
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:55,978
prior to commencing development arc.

69
00:03:56,339 --> 00:04:00,403
And I'm not gonna actually go into each detailed slide of it.

70
00:04:00,423 --> 00:04:01,844
I'm gonna kind of step through it real fast.

71
00:04:02,164 --> 00:04:04,727
But you'll get a sense of how high level it is.

72
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:06,729
And this is as close to a design document

73
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:09,031
as we have got on the title.

74
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,876
What's interesting is while it is very basic and high level,

75
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,277
it's all actually still accurate

76
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:18,679
to what the game's current state is.

77
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:20,721
We've never explicitly contradicted it.

78
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:25,487
And of course, if you go through and scrub through

79
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:26,448
the video recording of this,

80
00:04:26,468 --> 00:04:28,671
you'll be able to look at the documents details

81
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:30,773
in more detail.

82
00:04:31,517 --> 00:04:34,998
Probably worth noting too that the design spec

83
00:04:35,018 --> 00:04:36,819
we put together here informed a lot of things.

84
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:38,760
It didn't just keep the team on the same page.

85
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,861
It also let us tell our partners, hardware partners,

86
00:04:41,901 --> 00:04:43,542
platform partners, what the game was about

87
00:04:43,642 --> 00:04:46,303
in a very succinct, easy to digest way.

88
00:04:47,043 --> 00:04:48,724
And it just made it less complex to understand

89
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:50,505
the scope of the game we were trying to make

90
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:52,826
without getting into all the little nitty gritty details.

91
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:57,447
And effectively this mapped out a set of axioms

92
00:04:58,028 --> 00:05:01,029
that defined what is ARK as a game.

93
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,691
And it gave us kind of some guardrails

94
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:07,772
when we had some ideas that maybe seemed like good ideas.

95
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:09,893
If they fit strongly outside of this framework,

96
00:05:10,193 --> 00:05:12,674
then they would kind of be rejected out of hand.

97
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:16,936
But it gave us enough freedom to iterate

98
00:05:16,996 --> 00:05:20,578
and kind of creatively brainstorm within this framework.

99
00:05:23,435 --> 00:05:32,903
And as you can see, it's really more set of goals than a specific list of content. And that was

100
00:05:32,923 --> 00:05:35,345
the whole thing. That's all of ARC's design document.

101
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,092
But out of that, we've added so many features

102
00:05:42,353 --> 00:05:43,414
with the help of the community.

103
00:05:43,454 --> 00:05:46,976
These are all actually features that explicitly came

104
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:50,478
out of community suggestions and community iteration.

105
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:53,380
And we're gonna go over shortly with how we kind of distill

106
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,943
when we get a bunch of suggestions on our forum or on Steam,

107
00:05:57,983 --> 00:06:01,705
how do we actually distill that into what we decide

108
00:06:01,725 --> 00:06:03,806
to implement in the game, since we obviously can't put

109
00:06:03,846 --> 00:06:04,807
in everything that's suggested.

110
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,542
But as you can see, many things that run the gamut from

111
00:06:09,383 --> 00:06:12,305
gameplay to UI to meta game mechanics.

112
00:06:15,607 --> 00:06:17,168
So I'll talk a little bit about the community.

113
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:20,450
As Jeremy mentioned, we get lots of good feedback,

114
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,932
gameplay ideas directly from our community.

115
00:06:23,492 --> 00:06:26,154
And we treat the community feedback in the same way we

116
00:06:26,174 --> 00:06:28,236
treat our own feedback internally when we were first

117
00:06:28,296 --> 00:06:29,616
making the game before we launched.

118
00:06:29,957 --> 00:06:32,958
It's kind of a bottoms up approach, very playing the game.

119
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:34,499
We already know what the high level goals are,

120
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,660
so when we're playing the game and thinking about features

121
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,921
and listening to the way the community is playing the game,

122
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:40,541
we're thinking about all those things

123
00:06:40,862 --> 00:06:41,762
Jeremy just mentioned with,

124
00:06:41,782 --> 00:06:43,243
does it fit into our original plan?

125
00:06:43,663 --> 00:06:46,124
Is it something that we feel makes the game better?

126
00:06:46,484 --> 00:06:48,225
And we've got a bunch of metrics around that as well.

127
00:06:48,505 --> 00:06:50,786
But the first thing is really to have that community

128
00:06:50,806 --> 00:06:51,486
in the first place.

129
00:06:51,926 --> 00:06:54,107
And if you're going to do an early access title,

130
00:06:54,368 --> 00:06:56,128
it's really one of the most important things.

131
00:06:56,469 --> 00:07:00,572
When you go to launch your game, you better be ready with community management and take it

132
00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:05,757
very seriously. Our community managers are very good at what they do. They have a pulse on the

133
00:07:05,777 --> 00:07:10,822
community and they reinforce the relationship we have with the community on a daily basis. I

134
00:07:11,903 --> 00:07:13,985
don't want to make them blush. Some of them are in the room here.

135
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:20,993
So one of the first things we feel is really to get the community excited and to keep them excited

136
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:25,821
Because hype can be really good. We do this through a combination of patch notes

137
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:29,967
We're always writing up what's coming so people know what to look forward to

138
00:07:30,748 --> 00:07:33,010
might not always be exactly when it's coming,

139
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:34,491
but we kind of leave that stuff up there

140
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:37,032
so that people kind of know down the road,

141
00:07:37,132 --> 00:07:38,594
like a mini road map a little bit

142
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:40,095
of what they can look forward to

143
00:07:40,115 --> 00:07:42,196
in the coming months of development.

144
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:44,177
Teasers we do all the time.

145
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:45,619
When we first launched ARC,

146
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,640
we started putting out dossiers

147
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,301
for all the dinosaurs that would be in the game.

148
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:50,882
Even though some of them weren't coming

149
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:52,123
for months or even years,

150
00:07:52,704 --> 00:07:54,445
players still got to see the dinosaurs

151
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:55,966
and the creatures that would be in the game,

152
00:07:56,266 --> 00:07:57,887
hear a little bit about their abilities

153
00:07:57,967 --> 00:07:59,188
and the things that they might do.

154
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:02,212
and also give them an idea of kind of the scope

155
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:04,275
that was like ahead of development.

156
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:07,279
You know, it's one thing to read about words on a page,

157
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,582
the Steam page about what we're going to put in the game,

158
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,304
but when you start seeing visuals

159
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:13,948
and start seeing stuff early, it's real.

160
00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:17,790
you start to feel a little bit more attached to it

161
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,891
and excited about it.

162
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,252
Announcements, too, to go right along with those teasers.

163
00:08:22,312 --> 00:08:24,834
Whenever we have something new that's going into the game,

164
00:08:25,174 --> 00:08:26,274
we really spend a lot of time

165
00:08:26,314 --> 00:08:27,735
putting together those announcements,

166
00:08:28,235 --> 00:08:31,057
working to get out media alerts and press releases

167
00:08:31,397 --> 00:08:33,258
about the content that we're going into the game.

168
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:35,800
And it's not just for content, it's for things that we do

169
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,022
around the community that we'll see here

170
00:08:38,202 --> 00:08:39,083
in a couple more slides.

171
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,285
So touching on that, spreading the word is really important.

172
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:44,507
How do you get the word out about, you know,

173
00:08:44,927 --> 00:08:46,329
all this hype that you're generating?

174
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:48,611
I mentioned media alerts and press releases.

175
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:50,953
It's really good to, if you don't have a PR company

176
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:52,534
or a media company to...

177
00:08:53,855 --> 00:09:00,041
partner with one that can help you get into voicing your stuff that way. Because we all spend a lot of time making games.

178
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:04,365
We're not PR experts. We don't have the relationships with the media and all that stuff to do that.

179
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,789
So it's really beneficial to not spend a lot of time on that,

180
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:12,173
but partner with somebody that can help you maximize your time around those alerts.

181
00:09:13,014 --> 00:09:14,755
We always do trailers, like I mentioned,

182
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:15,916
the visuals are very good.

183
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:19,459
Trailers, screenshots, presentations for everything we do.

184
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:21,680
We really want players to get super excited

185
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,101
about the stuff that we're putting out,

186
00:09:23,482 --> 00:09:25,063
whether it's coming right now,

187
00:09:25,123 --> 00:09:26,964
which is usually the way we do things.

188
00:09:27,044 --> 00:09:29,206
It's like, here's the trailer, it's available today,

189
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,788
which is very useful for getting the word out

190
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:33,429
because everybody's so excited about it

191
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:34,630
that they want to play it right now.

192
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:37,552
So we try to pair those announcements and the media

193
00:09:38,073 --> 00:09:40,314
with gameplay stuff available right now as well,

194
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,896
and it's probably a good practice.

195
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:46,831
So we post stuff on our website, survivethearc.com.

196
00:09:47,432 --> 00:09:48,892
We mirror that on Steam and Reddit.

197
00:09:49,192 --> 00:09:51,894
We try to foster communities where players congregate.

198
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:53,795
You know, we love our website.

199
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:56,637
It evolved in a similar way to development

200
00:09:56,677 --> 00:09:58,558
where it kind of emerged out of a need for.

201
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:01,141
a place for players of all platforms to go.

202
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:03,524
But a lot of people like to chat on Reddit.

203
00:10:03,584 --> 00:10:05,025
They like to chat on Steam.

204
00:10:05,586 --> 00:10:07,428
So we try to mirror our messaging there

205
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:10,072
and spend most of our time moderating our own site.

206
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:12,054
But we go out on social media

207
00:10:12,074 --> 00:10:14,617
and the various console platforms,

208
00:10:14,738 --> 00:10:16,700
PlayStation and Xbox have their own ways

209
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,741
to talk to the communities.

210
00:10:18,222 --> 00:10:21,423
Again, everything I'm talking about here is community management.

211
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:26,385
So going back to the first thing I said, it's very important that you have somebody or multiple

212
00:10:26,805 --> 00:10:31,087
somebody, they're going to focus on this so you can spend time developing your game and

213
00:10:31,147 --> 00:10:34,828
all the great work you do gets out to the community and they get very excited about

214
00:10:34,848 --> 00:10:34,888
it.

215
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:38,472
So we want to keep the conversation flowing with our community.

216
00:10:39,132 --> 00:10:44,118
We've got a variety of ways to do this that we came up with with our community team.

217
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,302
One is one we call community crunch and

218
00:10:47,742 --> 00:10:50,886
this is something that Jatt runs all the time and Jen and it's

219
00:10:51,306 --> 00:10:53,287
just the latest cool stuff from the community.

220
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:55,508
I mean, Ark is a game with emerging gameplay

221
00:10:55,548 --> 00:10:56,668
about creating stuff.

222
00:10:57,028 --> 00:10:59,129
You see all sorts of things from music videos

223
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:01,070
to funny cartoons to screenshots

224
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,571
and media that people are taking.

225
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:06,352
And we encourage that because people have a lot of fun

226
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:07,313
with their creativity.

227
00:11:07,393 --> 00:11:08,733
We want to highlight it when it's.

228
00:11:09,114 --> 00:11:13,516
awesome and amazing. Sometimes even if it's questionable, but it's still awesome. We put

229
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:17,939
that out there, we put it in our spotlights. Anything anybody sends us, we've got fan made

230
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:22,282
dossiers, screenshots. It really makes the community feel like we're listening to them,

231
00:11:22,322 --> 00:11:26,745
which we are, and we're valuing the work that they're doing inside of our game that's so

232
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:33,209
important to them. And it really creates that kind of like two-way communication pipeline we

233
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:38,012
talked about. And we also do some content sneak peeks within the community crunch.

234
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,935
Occasionally we'll put out a little teaser or something that's outside of our normal

235
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:48,201
template for doing that sort of thing, like a little mysterious graphic of something that's

236
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:52,244
hinted that might be, you know, we did that when we were launching new creatures that

237
00:11:52,304 --> 00:11:53,885
hadn't been in the scope of the game before.

238
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:57,348
We put mysterious dossiers in the community crunch and stuff like that.

239
00:11:57,409 --> 00:12:00,471
So hiding little Easter eggs in our community stuff.

240
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:03,372
And then we do smaller announcements with Community Crunch,

241
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,293
like things about sales, merchandising, gameplay tweaks.

242
00:12:06,673 --> 00:12:07,933
Again, this is all community stuff.

243
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:10,354
Very important to have somebody that's on top of this.

244
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:12,454
Arc Digest is really great too.

245
00:12:13,134 --> 00:12:16,735
Usually this is Jeremy answering direct questions

246
00:12:16,855 --> 00:12:20,116
from community members, players.

247
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:22,096
They submit them all, we call them,

248
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:25,817
we answer their questions, listen to their feedback.

249
00:12:26,257 --> 00:12:28,358
And again, it's that two-way communication

250
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:29,098
with the community.

251
00:12:29,138 --> 00:12:30,638
So we're not just telling them stuff.

252
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,036
We're listening to them and responding to it.

253
00:12:36,207 --> 00:12:42,532
Another thing we do is rewarding our community for all of this great two-way relationship we have.

254
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:44,274
We really try to give back to them.

255
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:48,137
We call them out in all of the weekly spotlights with Community Crunch.

256
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:50,079
We run contests and prizes.

257
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,082
We reward people for building beautiful things in the game.

258
00:12:54,102 --> 00:12:59,086
We give them things like Steam gift cards, you know, a couple bucks here, call-outs there, free keys here.

259
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,768
We run mod contests.

260
00:13:01,128 --> 00:13:01,849
We partner with...

261
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,053
partners like NVIDIA with new platforms like Ansel,

262
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,335
and we integrated that, we run some contests for that.

263
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:12,097
And we just now launched a sponsored mods program,

264
00:13:12,117 --> 00:13:14,138
which is kind of a middle ground

265
00:13:14,178 --> 00:13:16,320
between being a professional game developer

266
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,221
and being a hobbyist.

267
00:13:17,701 --> 00:13:18,862
There's not really a way for people

268
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,044
to reliably sell their mods right now.

269
00:13:21,744 --> 00:13:24,707
out there, but ARK is a game that has a lot of mods,

270
00:13:24,747 --> 00:13:26,028
a lot of high quality mods.

271
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:29,310
This video here is our first sponsored mods

272
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,371
that we're starting this month,

273
00:13:30,451 --> 00:13:32,853
and we're literally funding these people

274
00:13:32,953 --> 00:13:34,635
to keep making their great mods,

275
00:13:34,975 --> 00:13:37,297
because we don't want them to stop or give up

276
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:40,419
because the pressures of life or their job or whatever

277
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:42,241
are too much and they have to stop working on it.

278
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,743
We really want to reinforce the work that they're doing

279
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:46,284
and the best mods...

280
00:13:47,705 --> 00:13:52,269
will rise to the top and month over month we'll continue to find those that the players are

281
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:57,494
playing and that they're really loving. A couple serious stuff, too, when it comes to

282
00:13:57,534 --> 00:14:02,919
rewarding people. We've in the past done exploit bounties, making sure that anything that's

283
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:09,665
kind of a hack or some sort of thing that's detrimental to the game, we can try to reward

284
00:14:09,685 --> 00:14:13,389
people for finding those things instead of exploiting them for their own personal gain.

285
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,574
It just goes along with this whole two-way street

286
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:17,235
we're talking about.

287
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:21,541
So the result of all this is that you have a community

288
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:22,883
that's passionate, which we do.

289
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:26,368
They're entitled, they know that they're part

290
00:14:26,388 --> 00:14:29,553
of development and they want to continue to contribute.

291
00:14:30,074 --> 00:14:32,014
they've got kind of an expectation from you

292
00:14:32,495 --> 00:14:34,155
and you've got an expectation from them.

293
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:37,517
They've got a voice and they've got all these ideas,

294
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:39,398
these great ideas sometimes,

295
00:14:39,538 --> 00:14:41,519
sometimes not the greatest ideas

296
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:43,120
to contribute back to development.

297
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,080
So that's the big question.

298
00:14:46,721 --> 00:14:47,281
How do you know?

299
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:51,046
and you shouldn't always listen to your community

300
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:54,047
and what they are saying, and you have to decide.

301
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:56,588
All these emergent features we talked about earlier

302
00:14:56,648 --> 00:14:59,910
kind of went down a path, and throughout development

303
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,771
we thought about how do we call these

304
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:04,372
and how do we take these and find the best ones

305
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:07,453
and actually implement them, and that's what we're gonna

306
00:15:07,493 --> 00:15:08,574
talk a little bit about now.

307
00:15:08,714 --> 00:15:12,255
Get through this one.

308
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:23,160
I mean, ultimately, the community really does have a bigger, more creative brain than any of us could possibly have by ourselves.

309
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:26,883
But it also can pull the game in a thousand different directions.

310
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:32,467
And, you know, the loudest voice in the room isn't necessarily representative of the larger player base.

311
00:15:33,187 --> 00:15:39,191
And to the extent that it's the loudest voice in the room, it might also be an impossible idea.

312
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:40,192
And for...

313
00:15:40,893 --> 00:15:45,876
various reasons it's important to have some kind of metric or scorecard we

314
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:50,820
found to kind of weight ideas against gameplay ideas whether they're coming

315
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,964
from us or even coming from the community we need a way to gauge their

316
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:57,646
viability and desirability that was

317
00:15:58,046 --> 00:16:04,812
Beyond just how vocal people or even ourselves were about doing a specific idea

318
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:13,360
This was particularly important because the game was live. So any misstep, you know, ultimately would cost us in terms of

319
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,461
players

320
00:16:15,461 --> 00:16:16,022
experiencing

321
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:19,287
the better or worse that we might put into the game.

322
00:16:19,367 --> 00:16:21,870
So ultimately we came around to implement

323
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,573
a feature scorecard into our internal design process

324
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:29,316
that would allow us to grade potential ideas

325
00:16:29,436 --> 00:16:31,418
against a variety of criteria.

326
00:16:31,838 --> 00:16:33,699
And I'm gonna go over how the scorecard works.

327
00:16:41,103 --> 00:16:43,347
Okay, so it's a series of points,

328
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,493
and ultimately there's a threshold

329
00:16:47,535 --> 00:16:49,919
over which a specific idea must reach

330
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,825
for it to be like automatically included in the game

331
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,666
that we should totally do it.

332
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:57,210
And the first kind of question is, do we want to do it?

333
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,112
Is it, doesn't necessarily mean that we came up

334
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,393
with the idea, that's irrelevant.

335
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,317
But is it something that we, internally at Wildcard,

336
00:17:04,337 --> 00:17:05,358
are really passionate about?

337
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,661
Easy enough for us to determine.

338
00:17:09,342 --> 00:17:09,962
Just ask the team.

339
00:17:09,982 --> 00:17:10,062
Then...

340
00:17:11,924 --> 00:17:13,324
do we think the community wants it?

341
00:17:14,085 --> 00:17:16,885
And again, it's not necessarily as simple as saying

342
00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:18,165
we should do everything the community wants

343
00:17:18,225 --> 00:17:19,466
and nothing the community doesn't want.

344
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,666
As we're gonna see, some things the community wants

345
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:23,026
turn out not to be so great,

346
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:24,887
and something the community doesn't want,

347
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:27,067
at least initially before it comes out,

348
00:17:27,107 --> 00:17:29,588
say they don't want, actually turn out to be quite useful

349
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:31,288
to the long-term health of the game.

350
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:35,489
But we try and gauge whether the community wants it.

351
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:39,071
community is going to want something. That's usually by putting it in patch notes, by

352
00:17:39,331 --> 00:17:42,834
telegraphing it on social media, and having our very talented community team

353
00:17:43,374 --> 00:17:47,716
gauge the response through a variety of metrics. However, this does tend to boil

354
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:51,699
down to the loudest voice in the room, so that's why it's not the only criteria

355
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,001
or it's not necessarily weighted any higher than our own voice in the matter.

356
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,896
The other question is, is it good for new players?

357
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,898
If you just have downloaded Arc Today,

358
00:18:00,938 --> 00:18:04,840
you're a new noob on the island starting out,

359
00:18:05,061 --> 00:18:08,023
is this going to help you get into the game?

360
00:18:08,063 --> 00:18:09,003
Is it gonna be neutral?

361
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:11,185
Some things we add that are actually very useful

362
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:14,087
can actually be negative towards a new player in the game.

363
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:18,248
You'll see one of those later that's actually a good feature overall for the game,

364
00:18:18,268 --> 00:18:20,969
but it's not necessarily helpful for new players.

365
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:24,850
But generally that's a criteria we want to bias towards,

366
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:28,671
is things that are good or at the very least neutral for the new player experience.

367
00:18:30,071 --> 00:18:31,751
Is the idea beneficial to development?

368
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:34,992
What that means is, it's shipping the game, specifically.

369
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:40,355
I'm not talking about whether it's good for marketing purposes or anything else.

370
00:18:40,395 --> 00:18:47,139
I'm talking about is this feature in line with the ideas of what ARK needs to have to ship

371
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:53,543
or does this idea kind of sit outside that rubric, maybe make the game take longer to ship,

372
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:59,406
make it more complicated to ship, add a lot more work to what would be the total content set of the game.

373
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:06,506
Does it lack controversy? Obviously we're not afraid of controversy at wild card as you've

374
00:19:06,526 --> 00:19:14,092
probably seen, so it's not weighted as highly as the other points. But nevertheless, it's

375
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:19,877
still something we try to factor in. Is this going to be controversial or is it not?

376
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:27,957
And we gauge this, by the way, again, by reading the community posts and taking polls.

377
00:19:29,177 --> 00:19:32,599
It's worth noting that this is a little different than whether the community wants it.

378
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:36,861
What we look for in terms of gauging whether the community wants it is whether there's any

379
00:19:37,462 --> 00:19:41,644
sizable group of players out there saying, this is really cool, this is a good idea.

380
00:19:41,704 --> 00:19:44,586
Conversely, is whether there's also a sizable group saying no.

381
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:48,169
is easy to implement.

382
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,571
You know, like any human beings

383
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:52,092
are sometimes afraid of challenges,

384
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:54,594
so we don't like to necessarily take on things

385
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:57,436
that we think are gonna be very, very difficult for us.

386
00:19:58,257 --> 00:20:02,180
But it's not the most overriding determining factor,

387
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,961
and usually the producers will give us

388
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,603
a pretty good estimate of what it's gonna take

389
00:20:05,643 --> 00:20:06,423
to make it happen.

390
00:20:07,913 --> 00:20:12,137
Final criteria is can we do a good job with it?

391
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:15,460
We don't necessarily love to jump into tasks

392
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,603
that we think inherently are going to break our team,

393
00:20:19,443 --> 00:20:20,584
technically or creatively,

394
00:20:20,624 --> 00:20:23,587
that we think we're going to do a poor job at,

395
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:26,429
and sometimes that's inevitable,

396
00:20:26,469 --> 00:20:28,311
and we just have to give it a shot anyway.

397
00:20:29,592 --> 00:20:35,081
the greater good, but other times that can be a factor in deciding whether or not to

398
00:20:35,121 --> 00:20:40,790
go into doing a feature if we think it's just beyond our capability to do what we would

399
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:41,651
be proud of with it.

400
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:48,155
But then what we do is we take the results of all of these

401
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:52,618
criteria and sometimes it can be a neutral, a slash,

402
00:20:52,978 --> 00:20:58,082
zero points, or a check mark would be the positive points

403
00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:02,524
or a X would be negative points and we add it up.

404
00:21:03,165 --> 00:21:05,706
And we consider our threshold to be two.

405
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:07,567
If it's two or above,

406
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:15,386
we should do it. Less than two, we probably shouldn't do it. And it's really just that

407
00:21:15,426 --> 00:21:18,549
simple. And we kind of run this through every new feature now that comes through the

408
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,492
pipeline. And there we go.

409
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:25,028
Now we're gonna talk a little bit,

410
00:21:25,068 --> 00:21:27,789
before we get into how this scorecard actually applies

411
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:29,230
to some of the features in the game,

412
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:33,392
let's talk about a subject which many PC developers

413
00:21:33,412 --> 00:21:35,013
will probably be familiar with, which is Steam reviews

414
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:36,373
and how we think that actually relates

415
00:21:37,114 --> 00:21:39,735
to looking at the feedback we get

416
00:21:39,775 --> 00:21:40,636
from some of these features.

417
00:21:41,076 --> 00:21:43,057
We don't consider it to be the overall metric

418
00:21:43,277 --> 00:21:44,918
that is most meaningful and here's why.

419
00:21:45,755 --> 00:21:56,210
Yeah, it's worth noting that Steam actually does encourage users to provide any type of feedback that feels relevant to a game's development, not just based on a game's merits.

420
00:21:56,671 --> 00:22:02,139
So, you'll find that this kind of biases the recent reviews portion of Steam to...

421
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:09,061
what's been going on with the game in the last 30 days or so in a lot of cases. And we've

422
00:22:09,101 --> 00:22:13,822
noticed we've gotten some review bombs and they can be very informative as kind of a

423
00:22:13,902 --> 00:22:19,123
response to your actions. And this has been not just for things in the game but for things

424
00:22:19,183 --> 00:22:24,124
that have nothing to do with the game development itself. And because of that, it's kind of

425
00:22:24,144 --> 00:22:30,646
a little bit to be taken in consideration with the other factors you use to judge the

426
00:22:30,686 --> 00:22:31,346
health of the game.

427
00:22:32,298 --> 00:22:36,020
And one thing is with the reviews themselves,

428
00:22:36,481 --> 00:22:40,343
it's really just generally another metric for temperature.

429
00:22:41,364 --> 00:22:42,645
You know, Jeremy, you've got probably

430
00:22:42,665 --> 00:22:43,785
some thoughts on that, but.

431
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:47,868
Steam reviews, in our opinion, are very, very helpful

432
00:22:47,948 --> 00:22:48,848
for gauging the...

433
00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:54,029
Feeling of your community and it is important to take that into consideration

434
00:22:54,069 --> 00:23:00,575
But they're not necessarily as useful for gauging the overall health of your game in my opinion the most important metric for that in

435
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:02,116
terms of steam at least is

436
00:23:02,397 --> 00:23:07,682
Concurrent user count players who's actually playing your game, and how many of them are there?

437
00:23:08,282 --> 00:23:11,325
We've hit some of our highest CCUs ever six digits

438
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:13,847
We've had some of our lowest steam reviews ever

439
00:23:14,668 --> 00:23:19,630
And take from that what you will, but our goal is that people are playing the game,

440
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,230
and they are staying in the game.

441
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,252
And that ultimately, hopefully means a fun game, but we are not as obsessed over our

442
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:29,433
Steam reviews as we are about player engagement in the title.

443
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:39,535
And now we're going to look at some historical examples about how the scorecard was used or not used

444
00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:42,378
relative to features in the game, and ultimately what happened.

445
00:23:42,858 --> 00:23:46,962
What did the data post-launch of a feature actually show, if we could gauge it,

446
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,986
in terms of the impact, and does it match up with what the scorecard would predict?

447
00:23:52,393 --> 00:23:54,155
First we're gonna talk about survival of the fittest,

448
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:56,937
which I more or less said, this will be a great idea.

449
00:23:56,997 --> 00:23:58,639
We have a quote associated with each feature.

450
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,802
In fact, the scorecard itself was designed

451
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:07,186
in response to the failure that was survival of the fittest

452
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:09,148
and a subsequent feature.

453
00:24:09,188 --> 00:24:11,390
We eventually came to the viewpoint that we needed

454
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,373
a system to actually make such decisions.

455
00:24:16,394 --> 00:24:18,135
We couldn't go solely based on our gut.

456
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:19,495
So this one's on me.

457
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:22,756
In terms of the scorecard,

458
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:23,916
I'm gonna briefly walk you through

459
00:24:23,936 --> 00:24:25,597
how it kind of sort of stacks up.

460
00:24:26,797 --> 00:24:27,498
We wanted to do it.

461
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:28,798
It's fun.

462
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:31,219
We really like the game mode.

463
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,259
We thought it was a worthy shot

464
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:36,080
at trying to do some e-sports type gameplay.

465
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,182
Frankly, what we were getting from the community was they wanted it too.

466
00:24:39,683 --> 00:24:45,627
We had a lot of fun running tournaments, we got a lot of great feedback that this was something players were really enjoying.

467
00:24:45,747 --> 00:24:51,391
It was Sotif, by the way, Survival of the Fittest, originally began as a mod for ARK that we created as a test,

468
00:24:51,511 --> 00:24:53,792
and the feedback there was, I mean, it was a super popular mod.

469
00:24:54,333 --> 00:24:56,354
you know, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of downloads,

470
00:24:56,454 --> 00:24:59,317
lots of people viewing these play sessions.

471
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:01,318
We still, to this day, have people who are really,

472
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:02,359
really hardcore into it.

473
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:04,641
We thought, you know, very much based on what we could tell,

474
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:07,263
the community was enthused about it, and I think they were.

475
00:25:08,203 --> 00:25:09,504
It's neutral for new players.

476
00:25:09,544 --> 00:25:11,246
I mean, obviously it's not what a new player

477
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:15,889
is really caring about when they buy Ark Survival Evolved,

478
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:17,851
and that probably should have been the first warning sign.

479
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,152
It's not beneficial to development

480
00:25:20,172 --> 00:25:22,234
in the sense of shipping Ark Survival Evolved.

481
00:25:22,594 --> 00:25:27,937
also another warning sign, it didn't lack controversy because even though the community

482
00:25:28,138 --> 00:25:32,780
wanted it, it was still controversial. Remember what I was saying about in terms of engaging

483
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,703
with the community who wants something, we're just looking for a core of really positive feedback.

484
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:42,686
But it certainly was controversial to the extent that should we be utilizing development time and

485
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:44,688
development resources for making a mode that is...

486
00:25:45,328 --> 00:25:47,909
not really considered to be a core feature of the game,

487
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:50,850
should that really be our priority?

488
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,572
And that was the controversy justified from that standpoint.

489
00:25:55,552 --> 00:25:57,073
It certainly wasn't easy to implement.

490
00:25:57,313 --> 00:26:00,294
We ultimately did spin it off as an entirely separate,

491
00:26:00,514 --> 00:26:04,976
free product related to the ARK Survival Evolved game, but...

492
00:26:06,738 --> 00:26:11,684
That's a lot of work to launch in a completely separate application and manage that and QA

493
00:26:11,724 --> 00:26:11,944
that.

494
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:15,388
Very significant time investment there.

495
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:18,872
And as far as doing a great job, neutral at best.

496
00:26:19,213 --> 00:26:22,797
I mean, while the game mode certainly was very fun, even in its final form.

497
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:33,641
Wildcard is not an esports company and ultimately could not build the systems fast enough to support esports level gameplay

498
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:38,802
with the full tournament and matchmaking systems that people expect of that genre at this point in time.

499
00:26:39,162 --> 00:26:44,083
So, you know, best case scenario, we couldn't do a great job relative to player expectations.

500
00:26:44,764 --> 00:26:51,605
So, you know, ultimately where this gets us is, we, you know, perceived that there was a demand for it.

501
00:26:53,147 --> 00:26:56,727
There was obviously a great majority of players who at best didn't care.

502
00:26:58,128 --> 00:27:00,328
And it was costly to develop.

503
00:27:01,108 --> 00:27:04,409
The CCUs were not impressive to say the least.

504
00:27:04,469 --> 00:27:06,729
That's the CCUs chart right there on the bottom, by the way.

505
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:08,970
Yeah. Ultimately a failure.

506
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,511
And at the time, we did not have the scorecard.

507
00:27:12,551 --> 00:27:16,091
So how do we, you know, quantitatively looked at this?

508
00:27:16,832 --> 00:27:19,612
We hopefully would have made a different decision about whether to go forward with it.

509
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:24,001
Ah yes, my favorite quote.

510
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:26,484
The fact that Studio Money Grab's still in business

511
00:27:26,985 --> 00:27:27,506
is a shame.

512
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,977
Scorched Earth, as you may know, is a paid DLC,

513
00:27:31,077 --> 00:27:32,258
launched in early access.

514
00:27:33,138 --> 00:27:35,099
Don't recommend that anybody really does this,

515
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,362
but for us, it was a success for a lot of reasons,

516
00:27:39,802 --> 00:27:41,303
and we'll go through that right now.

517
00:27:42,063 --> 00:27:45,005
So we wanted to do it because it was important

518
00:27:45,045 --> 00:27:45,825
to our development.

519
00:27:46,245 --> 00:27:49,487
It was part of our pipeline for creating new content,

520
00:27:49,547 --> 00:27:51,308
new maps that players could go to,

521
00:27:51,828 --> 00:27:55,170
and it allowed us to really develop portions of the game

522
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,931
that we needed to do for launch.

523
00:27:58,412 --> 00:28:02,114
We had kind of a huge controversial thing happen

524
00:28:02,134 --> 00:28:04,835
when we launched it where of course people were upset

525
00:28:04,895 --> 00:28:07,016
that any early access game could do such a thing.

526
00:28:07,656 --> 00:28:09,697
So we did get a lot of that sort of pushback

527
00:28:10,758 --> 00:28:13,319
and there was a big review bomb as a result of this.

528
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,600
You can see that's our reviews chart on the top there.

529
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,942
That's when we launched Scorched Earth.

530
00:28:19,062 --> 00:28:20,382
Those are the reviews for ARK

531
00:28:20,923 --> 00:28:23,464
and it was pretty bad for a couple weeks

532
00:28:23,724 --> 00:28:24,865
of negative reviews.

533
00:28:25,525 --> 00:28:28,127
But it was still number one on Steam for over a week.

534
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:29,328
The expansion pack was.

535
00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:32,811
The game, the base game was number two on Steam

536
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:33,632
at the same time.

537
00:28:34,072 --> 00:28:36,033
The expansion pack was highly rated,

538
00:28:36,754 --> 00:28:38,295
higher than ARK had ever been, 82%.

539
00:28:40,517 --> 00:28:42,439
And there was also a large increase

540
00:28:42,739 --> 00:28:44,140
in the daily user counts.

541
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,961
I mean, people were loving the content,

542
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:46,722
they were playing it,

543
00:28:47,042 --> 00:28:49,404
and the user counts were just going up.

544
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:51,846
So for all of these reasons,

545
00:28:52,186 --> 00:28:53,868
Scorce Earth for us was a success.

546
00:28:54,288 --> 00:28:54,929
Players loved it.

547
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,572
It was a financial success.

548
00:28:56,893 --> 00:28:59,237
It helped us get closer to the game's development.

549
00:28:59,677 --> 00:29:02,242
And even kind of knowing what we do now about launching,

550
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,345
we'd probably still do it because it

551
00:29:04,385 --> 00:29:07,791
was such an important part of our road to launch.

552
00:29:10,296 --> 00:29:14,238
The next thing we would apply to the scorecard

553
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:16,639
is the dino rebalance.

554
00:29:16,899 --> 00:29:20,341
And this ultimately had us going through and,

555
00:29:20,361 --> 00:29:22,943
I like that quote.

556
00:29:23,403 --> 00:29:24,564
This ultimately had us going through

557
00:29:24,604 --> 00:29:26,825
and fixing some serious magic numbers

558
00:29:26,885 --> 00:29:28,065
associated with how powerful,

559
00:29:28,085 --> 00:29:29,226
I mean, what has that dinosaur been doing?

560
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:31,787
It's killing like humongous giganosauruses

561
00:29:31,807 --> 00:29:32,348
all over the place.

562
00:29:32,728 --> 00:29:37,552
So we needed to rescale how powerful players' dinosaurs were.

563
00:29:38,013 --> 00:29:40,435
And this is always a tough challenge in a live game

564
00:29:40,795 --> 00:29:42,197
because players like candy.

565
00:29:42,997 --> 00:29:44,339
And when you take the candy away,

566
00:29:44,739 --> 00:29:46,941
they can be pretty vocal about it.

567
00:29:47,862 --> 00:29:49,303
But sometimes that's necessary

568
00:29:49,383 --> 00:29:51,065
because too much candy can make someone sick,

569
00:29:51,125 --> 00:29:52,746
to take that metaphor all the way through.

570
00:29:54,088 --> 00:29:56,511
So, we wanted to do it.

571
00:29:56,611 --> 00:29:59,474
We knew the numbers and how they were scaled

572
00:29:59,775 --> 00:30:01,477
in terms of these tame dinosaurs

573
00:30:01,517 --> 00:30:04,660
becoming God-killing machines was unsustainable.

574
00:30:05,714 --> 00:30:13,521
The general consensus from the community prior to releasing this was they did not want their dinosaurs to become weaker.

575
00:30:14,422 --> 00:30:21,489
It is good for new players because ultimately people's super tame dinos were unkillable for new players.

576
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:26,655
So it gave new players more of a slightly more level power ramp relative to people who had...

577
00:30:27,255 --> 00:30:28,737
already gotten Tamed Dinosaurs.

578
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:32,221
It was beneficial to development in the sense that

579
00:30:32,421 --> 00:30:34,723
we were trying to shape the game a little closer

580
00:30:34,763 --> 00:30:36,926
to its final balance and so doing this.

581
00:30:37,386 --> 00:30:40,029
It certainly was not without controversy.

582
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,953
Prior and post its launch, there were many people

583
00:30:43,993 --> 00:30:45,855
who said that they would never play Ark again

584
00:30:45,996 --> 00:30:47,397
and then they played Ark again.

585
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:50,398
But it was easy to implement.

586
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:52,498
Ultimately we're just talking about changing some numbers

587
00:30:52,538 --> 00:30:54,639
behind the scenes and because it was easy to implement,

588
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:55,659
we could do a good job.

589
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:58,140
It was not the most technically difficult thing.

590
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,961
But there we go.

591
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:03,521
I mean, certainly, you know,

592
00:31:03,561 --> 00:31:04,961
there was a bit of a review hit for that,

593
00:31:05,261 --> 00:31:06,061
like many things we do,

594
00:31:06,422 --> 00:31:10,062
but the ultimate data, as you can see in that graph there,

595
00:31:10,082 --> 00:31:11,683
it was very clear when it came out,

596
00:31:12,063 --> 00:31:14,343
the player counts went up and they never went back down.

597
00:31:15,264 --> 00:31:17,744
So, you know, sometimes this is one of those cases

598
00:31:17,784 --> 00:31:21,605
where the community, prior to its release,

599
00:31:21,785 --> 00:31:23,366
and in the immediate post of its release

600
00:31:23,386 --> 00:31:25,586
was telling us no, no, no, but ultimately

601
00:31:26,126 --> 00:31:28,167
was helpful for the health, the long-term health

602
00:31:28,607 --> 00:31:29,267
of the meta game.

603
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:32,068
And I would say that many players,

604
00:31:32,088 --> 00:31:33,748
probably most players by this point,

605
00:31:34,048 --> 00:31:36,869
have seen that I think rescaling those numbers

606
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:39,130
has given the game a longer tail

607
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,090
and have probably appreciated that in the long term.

608
00:31:43,482 --> 00:31:46,943
And I guess the general rule I would draw from that is

609
00:31:47,143 --> 00:31:49,964
sometimes you have to do what's necessary for the long-term health of the game

610
00:31:50,385 --> 00:31:54,726
in spite of maybe some short-term negative consequences.

611
00:31:58,354 --> 00:32:00,695
Swamp fever is the worst thing I have ever experienced.

612
00:32:01,975 --> 00:32:04,076
That's a good one too.

613
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,276
So this one was the other thing Jeremy mentioned

614
00:32:06,296 --> 00:32:08,417
that kind of made us realize we need

615
00:32:08,477 --> 00:32:09,797
this sort of scoring system.

616
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:11,098
We really wanted it.

617
00:32:11,938 --> 00:32:14,319
It was kind of part of our original plan

618
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,659
to add communicable diseases to the game

619
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,760
and to really kind of make that survival aspect

620
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,261
a little bit more hardcore,

621
00:32:21,301 --> 00:32:23,201
make you have to deal with a little bit more stuff.

622
00:32:23,862 --> 00:32:26,662
The community, some people liked it,

623
00:32:26,882 --> 00:32:27,843
some people didn't like it.

624
00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:30,285
They probably didn't know what they were in for

625
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:33,488
before they had that feeling though.

626
00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:37,031
What ended up happening was we implemented this feature

627
00:32:37,071 --> 00:32:39,133
and it turned out to be very bad for new players.

628
00:32:39,854 --> 00:32:43,057
It was the requirements to construct an antidote

629
00:32:43,077 --> 00:32:44,158
were very high in the game.

630
00:32:44,418 --> 00:32:47,261
It was very easy to catch swamp fever.

631
00:32:47,621 --> 00:32:50,644
And so the new players were just getting like wrecked.

632
00:32:51,024 --> 00:32:51,725
by this feature.

633
00:32:52,225 --> 00:32:54,246
And the players that are already good at the game

634
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:55,967
were just super annoyed by it,

635
00:32:55,987 --> 00:32:56,747
because they're like, well, great,

636
00:32:56,788 --> 00:32:57,868
now I have to make more antidote.

637
00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:00,690
And so it was kind of like something

638
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:03,491
that we felt was beneficial to development,

639
00:33:03,511 --> 00:33:05,573
because it was getting us closer to our goals,

640
00:33:05,913 --> 00:33:07,894
but it ended up being super controversial.

641
00:33:08,614 --> 00:33:10,976
Even though it was easy to implement, there is like...

642
00:33:11,516 --> 00:33:13,697
we really didn't do the best job doing it in the end,

643
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,699
retrospectively.

644
00:33:16,219 --> 00:33:19,140
And the interesting thing about Swamp Fever

645
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:22,062
was that there wasn't really a huge outcry

646
00:33:22,222 --> 00:33:23,663
of like, this is terrible,

647
00:33:23,743 --> 00:33:25,484
even though that quote literally says that.

648
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,145
But the community did hate it,

649
00:33:28,185 --> 00:33:30,247
but they weren't responding in some of the other ways.

650
00:33:30,287 --> 00:33:32,548
Like we weren't getting like hammered with negative reviews.

651
00:33:33,248 --> 00:33:34,629
You know, there were threads popping up

652
00:33:34,689 --> 00:33:35,870
and like, oh, this is bad.

653
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,611
This is, I can't believe Wildcard's doing this, whatever.

654
00:33:37,631 --> 00:33:38,591
But it wasn't like,

655
00:33:39,112 --> 00:33:40,773
Crazy, I mean we always see that.

656
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:42,774
Anytime you do something, it's the worst thing ever.

657
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:47,298
But we did notice there was a steady downward CCU trend.

658
00:33:47,738 --> 00:33:49,419
And for us, that's very strange.

659
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:52,401
And so the only thing that we could conclude

660
00:33:52,521 --> 00:33:55,824
was that Swamp Fever was pushing players from the game.

661
00:33:56,004 --> 00:33:57,625
New players were coming into the game,

662
00:33:58,005 --> 00:33:59,807
getting Swamp Fever and just quitting

663
00:33:59,827 --> 00:34:01,468
because they would just die over and over.

664
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,911
Players that were more advanced were just like,

665
00:34:05,951 --> 00:34:07,332
well, I'm gonna sit this out until

666
00:34:07,653 --> 00:34:08,814
this whole thing gets figured out

667
00:34:08,834 --> 00:34:10,976
because I don't wanna like ruin my character

668
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:11,996
and all of my equipment.

669
00:34:12,337 --> 00:34:13,277
Wait out the apocalypse.

670
00:34:13,338 --> 00:34:13,978
Exactly.

671
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:17,041
So we really miscalculated the effect

672
00:34:17,081 --> 00:34:19,903
this would have on everybody, especially new players,

673
00:34:19,943 --> 00:34:22,065
but it just made the game very difficult to play

674
00:34:22,525 --> 00:34:24,046
and this is definitely a failure.

675
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:27,089
And this, because it was kind of a sneaker failure,

676
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:28,230
we're like, how do we?

677
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,895
How do we tell in the future if something like this comes up?

678
00:34:31,955 --> 00:34:34,818
And it really helped us kind of design this scorecard

679
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:37,422
around the things that are most important in decision making.

680
00:34:37,983 --> 00:34:41,347
And in our scorecard, it's something we shouldn't have done

681
00:34:41,707 --> 00:34:43,290
if we had used the scorecard on this feature.

682
00:34:46,443 --> 00:34:53,566
This one is a feature that allows people in ARC to transfer their progress between servers.

683
00:34:53,846 --> 00:34:54,426
Science based.

684
00:34:54,906 --> 00:34:56,707
Yes. Like most things in ARC.

685
00:34:58,088 --> 00:34:59,769
And it definitely is a...

686
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:06,174
not conversion was a bold move on our part if I don't say so myself. So when we look at the

687
00:35:06,214 --> 00:35:12,999
scorecard though, it's actually quite directly and dramatically indicative of we should do it.

688
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,864
And we wanted to do it because we thought this would make the Meta game much more

689
00:35:17,884 --> 00:35:19,025
interesting. We like.

690
00:35:19,705 --> 00:35:23,947
dynamic mega games. We noticed a lot of these, prior to this a lot of the servers were

691
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:29,470
becoming ossified, static, the alpha tribes, the big dogs were just sitting on a server and

692
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:33,393
nobody could touch them because any time someone would join that server they would squash

693
00:35:33,413 --> 00:35:38,595
them like a bug. And what cross arc lets you do is if you're a big tribe on another server you

694
00:35:38,635 --> 00:35:42,638
can warp in all of your powerful stuff and you can really have alpha tribes from multiple

695
00:35:42,938 --> 00:35:44,299
servers going at it.

696
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:54,164
in a dynamic way, so you don't get this static, frozen balance of power on a single server.

697
00:35:54,184 --> 00:35:58,888
You can also have multiple tribes from different servers team up to take down a super tribe.

698
00:36:00,049 --> 00:36:03,492
So we wanted to do it. We thought it would have some great long-term benefits to the game.

699
00:36:03,532 --> 00:36:04,233
The community was...

700
00:36:05,814 --> 00:36:11,956
apathetic at best. There were a few people who thought it was a good idea, but no one was

701
00:36:11,976 --> 00:36:17,157
really like, yeah, tie all the servers together. It's not really good for new players, let's be

702
00:36:17,197 --> 00:36:22,258
honest about this. Because if you're a new player just trying to start out in the arc, you

703
00:36:22,298 --> 00:36:25,859
don't really need, and you're just getting your little thatch hut set up, you don't really need

704
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:31,220
some gods from above just swarming down and deciding that they don't like you on their beach

705
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,701
and wiping you out. So it's not really a new player thing, it's more of an advanced player

706
00:36:34,741 --> 00:36:35,081
mechanic.

707
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:41,146
Not really helpful for that, but this is one of those cases maybe where the long-term health of the game isn't explicitly

708
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:46,611
oriented towards just the new player. It is beneficial to development in multiple, for multiple reasons. One,

709
00:36:47,091 --> 00:36:53,297
we're interested in having a long-term tail for the game, but two, we also needed this technology to better support

710
00:36:54,398 --> 00:36:59,180
DLC in the future. We wanted to allow players to progress their characters

711
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:03,402
from one server to another to enter DLC servers without losing or having to

712
00:37:03,562 --> 00:37:06,543
losing the progress or having to start over from scratch and so this

713
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:10,345
technology was necessary to support that. Therefore in line with our long-term

714
00:37:10,365 --> 00:37:13,966
technical goals. Certainly didn't lack controversy though when this rolled out

715
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:16,728
there are many threads on all of our channels.

716
00:37:17,448 --> 00:37:23,192
popping up, there was a lot of people on both sides of the fence, so we certainly think the

717
00:37:23,212 --> 00:37:28,136
community was and is split over it. It was fairly easy for us to implement given we actually

718
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:33,120
had already built the technology for this for DLC. We just had to kind of widen it and

719
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,364
change a few back end things to allow it to operate between all servers and not just from a

720
00:37:38,544 --> 00:37:43,367
non-DLC server to a DLC server. We figured we could do a pretty good job at it given that

721
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,485
we had already kind of experimented with the technology for DLC transfer.

722
00:37:49,305 --> 00:37:52,829
An interesting thing happened when we released this feature.

723
00:37:55,325 --> 00:37:56,545
the meta game did improve.

724
00:37:56,825 --> 00:38:00,066
The people who thought Ark had just become a frozen static,

725
00:38:00,246 --> 00:38:02,706
you know, wasteland of alpha tribes

726
00:38:02,806 --> 00:38:05,347
sitting on their unassailable fortresses

727
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:08,308
found that they actually had to compete to survive again,

728
00:38:08,348 --> 00:38:09,868
no matter how powerful they thought they were.

729
00:38:10,328 --> 00:38:12,209
And over time, to this day,

730
00:38:12,569 --> 00:38:15,009
our CCUs have continued to trend upwards as a result

731
00:38:15,529 --> 00:38:17,290
of this feature, probably primarily.

732
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:20,610
So by the metric we consider most important,

733
00:38:20,671 --> 00:38:21,731
people playing our game,

734
00:38:22,311 --> 00:38:25,212
we consider it a success and the scorecard bears that out.

735
00:38:27,775 --> 00:38:31,379
All right. This is a little embarrassing. Sorry we have to talk about this. I would

736
00:38:31,419 --> 00:38:38,928
like to apologize for our sheep gate scenario. In case you missed it, this was a little controversy

737
00:38:38,948 --> 00:38:42,832
that arose while we were all on vacation and during the holiday time frame, of course.

738
00:38:44,014 --> 00:38:48,078
But basically, ARK was nominated for a Steam Award,

739
00:38:48,479 --> 00:38:50,461
and it was best use of a farm animal.

740
00:38:50,881 --> 00:38:53,444
We thought, hey, we don't really have any farm animals,

741
00:38:53,504 --> 00:38:56,608
so maybe it'd be cool to add one if we won.

742
00:38:56,628 --> 00:38:57,449
That would be cool, right?

743
00:38:57,489 --> 00:38:59,731
Like maybe people would like that,

744
00:38:59,891 --> 00:39:01,813
and they might wanna vote for the game.

745
00:39:02,794 --> 00:39:04,176
Yeah, guess what?

746
00:39:04,998 --> 00:39:07,359
People felt pretty bribed, apparently, by that.

747
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,581
And news articles, left and right.

748
00:39:10,921 --> 00:39:12,201
Wildcards, gummy developer,

749
00:39:12,261 --> 00:39:14,803
bribing players for a Steam Award.

750
00:39:14,883 --> 00:39:16,383
Mind you, the Steam Awards are very silly.

751
00:39:16,603 --> 00:39:17,904
Like, if you don't know about the Steam Awards,

752
00:39:17,924 --> 00:39:18,504
they're very silly.

753
00:39:19,004 --> 00:39:22,786
And we had a really quick onset of negative press for us,

754
00:39:23,126 --> 00:39:24,126
you know, wanting to give back

755
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:25,587
and put something in the game.

756
00:39:26,207 --> 00:39:28,988
And we got kind of a mild review bomb from this,

757
00:39:29,689 --> 00:39:29,869
but...

758
00:39:30,529 --> 00:39:32,751
you know, we just thought it wasn't really worth it.

759
00:39:32,851 --> 00:39:34,211
Like if you go through our scorecard,

760
00:39:34,252 --> 00:39:35,212
like we wanted to do this

761
00:39:35,252 --> 00:39:36,553
because we thought it was a cool idea.

762
00:39:37,013 --> 00:39:38,034
The community didn't want it

763
00:39:38,134 --> 00:39:39,555
because like they didn't even know about it.

764
00:39:40,035 --> 00:39:41,576
And once they heard about it,

765
00:39:41,916 --> 00:39:44,778
you know, they definitely were upset about it.

766
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:46,439
We kind of like

767
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,016
didn't matter to new players at all.

768
00:39:50,216 --> 00:39:52,458
It didn't really help us get closer to launch.

769
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:55,601
Pretty much, there was no reason to do this,

770
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:57,522
except we thought we could do a good job at it,

771
00:39:57,642 --> 00:39:59,564
and we thought it was kind of fun.

772
00:40:00,585 --> 00:40:03,287
Unfortunately, there was no real direct positive effect

773
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:06,169
from this whole idea of putting a sheep in the game,

774
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:10,693
and it was not really doing anything to help us

775
00:40:10,753 --> 00:40:12,534
in a time when the game was already doing really well.

776
00:40:12,614 --> 00:40:14,196
Like the CCUs were going up.

777
00:40:14,616 --> 00:40:19,220
crazy because of the holidays and the sales and everybody is getting into new games and

778
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,902
this didn't really add anything to the community or the game.

779
00:40:22,282 --> 00:40:28,527
So we kind of quickly realized this and adjusted our messaging and decided, look, regardless

780
00:40:28,547 --> 00:40:30,949
of what happens with the Steam Wars, we're going to put the sheep in the game anyway

781
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:34,831
because we really thought it was fun and why not have farm animals in ARK.

782
00:40:36,713 --> 00:40:38,534
It was a failure the way we tried to approach it,

783
00:40:39,114 --> 00:40:42,096
but we quickly fixed it and I think we turned it into a win

784
00:40:42,176 --> 00:40:44,757
because now we have cool sheep shearing and growable hair

785
00:40:44,797 --> 00:40:47,098
and all sorts of stuff spawned off from this sheep thing.

786
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:50,360
But we probably would have handled it slightly differently

787
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:52,681
if we were to kind of rewind

788
00:40:52,821 --> 00:40:54,282
and rethink things a little bit.

789
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,231
you know, applying the scorecard isn't always about looking at cases that are, you know,

790
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:05,659
historical. We also, as we indicated now, use it going forward.

791
00:41:07,287 --> 00:41:12,071
We did just launch a feature so I guess this is technically a historical case as well but we'll go

792
00:41:12,091 --> 00:41:15,753
through it anyway. We want to apply the scorecard to one of our most recently launched features

793
00:41:16,334 --> 00:41:22,578
which is called Tech Tier. And Tech Tier is basically a set of sci-fi items for the game

794
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:26,901
that pretty much dramatically change how the game is played in the long term.

795
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:35,422
You know, we really wanted to do tech tier, the sci-fi stuff, because it was always in line with our vision for Ark.

796
00:41:35,482 --> 00:41:41,066
I don't remember if it's in the pitch document, but I'm pretty sure we imply there's a real serious sci-fi aspect of the game.

797
00:41:41,406 --> 00:41:45,769
We viewed Ark from the beginning as starting with cavemen and ending at Halo.

798
00:41:46,529 --> 00:41:50,231
and so very much completing our vision

799
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:52,893
of the player's power progression to the end game.

800
00:41:53,253 --> 00:41:55,594
The community is for this.

801
00:41:55,734 --> 00:41:57,235
I mean, they think it's pretty cool.

802
00:41:57,876 --> 00:42:01,417
New players, eh, it's really an end game type of mechanic.

803
00:42:02,638 --> 00:42:03,739
Look, we could ship without it

804
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:07,221
and still have what we consider to be a complete game,

805
00:42:07,261 --> 00:42:08,721
so it's not really beneficial to development.

806
00:42:08,962 --> 00:42:10,022
It is controversial, though.

807
00:42:10,482 --> 00:42:13,664
It's a feature which, if you're just interested

808
00:42:13,684 --> 00:42:15,205
in this primitive kind of survival.

809
00:42:16,045 --> 00:42:18,546
maybe actually diminishes the feeling of

810
00:42:20,146 --> 00:42:22,107
being in a primitive lost world.

811
00:42:22,147 --> 00:42:26,368
Of course, we already had guns made out of raw materials,

812
00:42:26,468 --> 00:42:30,049
so it's kind of debatable how realistic ARK was

813
00:42:30,169 --> 00:42:32,109
prior to the introduction of laser pistols,

814
00:42:32,189 --> 00:42:35,830
but I think that players did feel that maybe it diminishes

815
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,790
the realism of the title.

816
00:42:38,951 --> 00:42:40,471
And it's not easy to implement.

817
00:42:41,491 --> 00:42:44,972
It's a lot of content that is actually fairly orthogonal

818
00:42:45,052 --> 00:42:45,592
to the...

819
00:42:46,392 --> 00:42:53,776
mechanics of the main game. We're talking about laser guns and force fields and cloning

820
00:42:53,816 --> 00:43:00,319
chambers and teleporters. These are all very distinct pieces of functionality that don't

821
00:43:00,379 --> 00:43:04,441
really overlap with the rest of the title. So from that standpoint, there's some overhead.

822
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:08,543
Not easy to implement. However, the team's really engaged with it artistically and

823
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:13,065
creatively, so we're not considering an afterthought. We do think we can do a good job at

824
00:43:13,105 --> 00:43:14,986
it. So it ultimately hit the

825
00:43:16,223 --> 00:43:18,323
you know, criteria of we should do it.

826
00:43:19,244 --> 00:43:21,104
And sorry, here's all the things I just said.

827
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:23,644
But here's the interesting thing.

828
00:43:23,744 --> 00:43:26,305
So it's a should do it on a scorecard,

829
00:43:26,765 --> 00:43:28,926
and about a week after we launched this feature,

830
00:43:29,306 --> 00:43:30,686
we hit our highest CCUs ever.

831
00:43:30,966 --> 00:43:34,307
Six figures, over 100K players playing the title

832
00:43:34,567 --> 00:43:36,047
on Steam simultaneously.

833
00:43:36,067 --> 00:43:37,147
So, you know,

834
00:43:38,828 --> 00:43:42,231
Is there a direct cause and effect relationship there? I think, likely.

835
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:48,176
The addition of this feature provides content for the hardest of the hardcore players,

836
00:43:48,216 --> 00:43:52,639
the endgame players, who otherwise might not have anything to do in the game anymore.

837
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:57,203
And, you know, targeting them with some long-term content and mechanics,

838
00:43:57,403 --> 00:44:01,326
it was part of our goal with this and probably brought a lot of those players back into the title.

839
00:44:01,627 --> 00:44:04,409
So we consider that a success. So far, so good.

840
00:44:07,216 --> 00:44:09,637
So underwater bases is a feature we haven't launched yet,

841
00:44:09,717 --> 00:44:10,758
but everybody knows about.

842
00:44:11,778 --> 00:44:13,619
And it's something people are really excited about.

843
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:15,580
As you can see, this person's been waiting for years

844
00:44:16,441 --> 00:44:17,401
for underwater bases.

845
00:44:18,442 --> 00:44:20,663
Note that Ark has not shipped years ago,

846
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:23,024
but just small minor points.

847
00:44:23,904 --> 00:44:26,045
So we say we don't really want it

848
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:30,087
because it kind of adds a lot of work to our plate

849
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:32,789
and it kind of changes a lot of dynamics

850
00:44:33,029 --> 00:44:34,650
about the game in a way we'll have to deal with.

851
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:35,890
for development.

852
00:44:36,231 --> 00:44:37,872
We definitely know the community wants it.

853
00:44:38,232 --> 00:44:39,272
There's no doubt about that.

854
00:44:39,292 --> 00:44:41,514
There's a lot of underwater ocean space in ARK

855
00:44:41,854 --> 00:44:44,095
and players want to make use of that space for sure.

856
00:44:44,936 --> 00:44:47,977
There's kind of like, nah, neutral on new players

857
00:44:48,017 --> 00:44:50,199
because a lot of the underwater content

858
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:53,861
and especially the tech tier is geared towards the end game.

859
00:44:54,201 --> 00:44:56,884
But new players are in tribes and they can team up

860
00:44:56,924 --> 00:44:58,886
with players that have underwater bases

861
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,027
and there's nothing preventing them

862
00:45:00,087 --> 00:45:01,829
from engaging in that content.

863
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,432
And beneficial to development,

864
00:45:04,472 --> 00:45:05,954
honestly we could ship the game without it.

865
00:45:06,794 --> 00:45:09,037
So it doesn't really help us get closer to launch in that.

866
00:45:09,477 --> 00:45:12,839
regard. We really feel like it straight up lacks controversy.

867
00:45:12,879 --> 00:45:15,581
Like, nobody's like, they better not put underwater bases in this

868
00:45:15,621 --> 00:45:19,323
game or I am quitting ARK. ARK is dead to me. That is not what

869
00:45:19,363 --> 00:45:22,604
anybody is saying. But it is really hard to implement. I mean,

870
00:45:22,664 --> 00:45:25,546
it's a totally new system. You know, we have to deal with, like,

871
00:45:25,626 --> 00:45:28,147
physics changing and there's oxygen and then there's not

872
00:45:28,207 --> 00:45:30,949
oxygen and then, you know, there's all sorts of collision

873
00:45:31,009 --> 00:45:33,650
problems we're going to probably have to deal with. And again,

874
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,752
it's another place where people can build bases that might get

875
00:45:37,453 --> 00:45:40,356
modified if we update maps and things like that later,

876
00:45:40,476 --> 00:45:41,877
introducing more bug cases.

877
00:45:42,858 --> 00:45:45,260
And, you know, it's like, honestly,

878
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,682
something we're like a little hesitant

879
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,003
because of all those complexities.

880
00:45:48,464 --> 00:45:49,885
How good of a job can we do with this?

881
00:45:49,945 --> 00:45:52,388
We're gonna do our best at it, as we always do.

882
00:45:52,928 --> 00:45:54,910
But just going into it, we're a little like,

883
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:56,131
man, this is gonna be a lot of work.

884
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,413
And, you know, like.

885
00:45:58,354 --> 00:46:03,096
it's hard. To be honest, it's going to be a hard feature. And it's not because we don't think it

886
00:46:03,136 --> 00:46:07,237
will be good for people that we're hesitant to do it. We really think it will be awesome. But

887
00:46:07,257 --> 00:46:12,279
you know, it's just we're human and stuff's hard and it's getting close to launch. But we're

888
00:46:12,299 --> 00:46:17,382
already publicly committed to this. No way around that. Community really wants it. And

889
00:46:17,702 --> 00:46:22,704
there's kind of this whole risk reward thing. It's not like survival of the fittest where, you

890
00:46:22,744 --> 00:46:26,666
know, it's high risk and if it fails, it's like really.

891
00:46:27,566 --> 00:46:28,327
not the best thing.

892
00:46:29,187 --> 00:46:31,169
But this is, you know what,

893
00:46:31,309 --> 00:46:33,170
if it doesn't work out perfectly,

894
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:34,791
if it's got its issues,

895
00:46:35,471 --> 00:46:37,113
it's a little bit of a less impact

896
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:38,594
on the game in a negative way.

897
00:46:39,154 --> 00:46:41,135
And it's another feature that we can add.

898
00:46:41,756 --> 00:46:44,978
And it's not something that we're overly scared about

899
00:46:45,378 --> 00:46:47,360
being really bad in any way.

900
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,861
So we think that we're gonna take a leap of faith,

901
00:46:50,101 --> 00:46:50,622
even though the...

902
00:46:51,422 --> 00:46:53,803
Scorecard says we should not do underwater bases.

903
00:46:54,743 --> 00:46:56,024
We're kind of going to ignore that.

904
00:46:56,744 --> 00:46:58,784
And that's a good point about this whole system

905
00:46:58,884 --> 00:47:02,745
is that sometimes you just have to go

906
00:47:02,765 --> 00:47:03,826
with your gut on something.

907
00:47:04,106 --> 00:47:05,906
And even though this feature is something

908
00:47:05,946 --> 00:47:08,107
that we probably shouldn't do based on our own scoring

909
00:47:08,167 --> 00:47:10,528
system, we're just going to do it anyway.

910
00:47:10,908 --> 00:47:13,108
And the risk is not great enough that it's

911
00:47:13,128 --> 00:47:15,549
going to kill us if it ends up being a failure.

912
00:47:16,169 --> 00:47:17,470
We'll see where we end up in a month.

913
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:20,051
Yeah, I may be saying something different

914
00:47:20,111 --> 00:47:22,453
after like 100 hour weeks of no sleep

915
00:47:22,473 --> 00:47:23,193
for the next four weeks.

916
00:47:24,134 --> 00:47:26,455
So anyway, yeah, just to recap.

917
00:47:27,295 --> 00:47:28,516
So we have an interesting.

918
00:47:29,756 --> 00:47:33,680
kind of overall process for making decisions in ARC

919
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,741
about what we do.

920
00:47:35,161 --> 00:47:37,383
We, first off, keep the community really healthy

921
00:47:37,403 --> 00:47:40,085
and engaged through weekly updates,

922
00:47:40,466 --> 00:47:41,707
daily social engagement,

923
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:44,049
and a two-way communication process.

924
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:49,494
We essentially don't stick with a rigid,

925
00:47:49,554 --> 00:47:51,155
static, top-down roadmap.

926
00:47:51,195 --> 00:47:53,397
We go with more of a bottom-up approach.

927
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:59,846
to designing features in terms of soliciting community ideas.

928
00:48:01,147 --> 00:48:03,749
But we don't just say, hey, if the community wants it,

929
00:48:03,769 --> 00:48:04,449
it's something we should do.

930
00:48:04,489 --> 00:48:07,011
We run it through a process now that

931
00:48:08,295 --> 00:48:09,256
includes a grading system.

932
00:48:09,756 --> 00:48:12,396
But we also don't religiously adhere to that either.

933
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:16,177
We still leave for an element of serendipity,

934
00:48:16,337 --> 00:48:21,078
of inspiration, and of faith to get ultimately

935
00:48:21,178 --> 00:48:22,838
to the bottom line of what should go in the game

936
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:23,358
and what shouldn't.

937
00:48:24,018 --> 00:48:27,999
And if there's an element of risk in that,

938
00:48:28,219 --> 00:48:29,920
then there's also an element of reward.

939
00:48:34,887 --> 00:48:38,891
You know, overall, ARK certainly is a successful early access game.

940
00:48:39,612 --> 00:48:42,095
The numbers kind of speak for themselves.

941
00:48:43,116 --> 00:48:49,603
But it's definitely some things you have to keep in mind by going this route.

942
00:48:49,683 --> 00:48:52,966
You are best off, in my opinion, not...

943
00:48:53,861 --> 00:48:57,904
committing yourself to a static mindset of,

944
00:48:58,245 --> 00:48:59,386
here's the game you're going to make,

945
00:48:59,626 --> 00:49:02,168
and darn if anybody's going to tell you otherwise.

946
00:49:02,348 --> 00:49:05,711
You realistically need to be prepared to swerve left

947
00:49:05,751 --> 00:49:08,914
and swerve right based on how the community is perceiving

948
00:49:09,674 --> 00:49:11,096
the direction of your game.

949
00:49:11,276 --> 00:49:15,620
Essentially, keep an open mind and be very reactive.

950
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:20,369
It's really important to prioritize content in early access.

951
00:49:21,169 --> 00:49:23,749
You'll see some games come out with a decent amount of content

952
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:29,310
and then really right away focus on bug fixes and performance stuff.

953
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:32,531
And that's all great. It's an important part of development.

954
00:49:33,131 --> 00:49:37,432
But we really feel like the optimization and non-critical bug stuff

955
00:49:37,512 --> 00:49:40,993
is less important than adding the content to the game that keeps people coming back.

956
00:49:41,413 --> 00:49:45,213
It keeps new players coming to the game because there's new stuff.

957
00:49:45,754 --> 00:49:47,615
It keeps old players still playing the game

958
00:49:47,635 --> 00:49:49,376
because there's always new stuff to come back to.

959
00:49:49,936 --> 00:49:52,838
And the way we've chosen to do early access

960
00:49:53,038 --> 00:49:55,319
is throughout the rest of development,

961
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,521
we kind of front loaded all the content features

962
00:49:58,881 --> 00:50:00,983
and planning to do the final optimization

963
00:50:01,023 --> 00:50:03,904
and non-critical bug fixes towards the end of development.

964
00:50:04,365 --> 00:50:07,768
A lot of people take issue with that in the player community.

965
00:50:07,989 --> 00:50:11,292
Everybody has a bug that is the most important bug.

966
00:50:11,352 --> 00:50:14,215
But in the broader player base, that may not be the case.

967
00:50:14,315 --> 00:50:17,599
And we really try to prioritize which bugs actually get fixed

968
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:20,342
and which optimizations we do, because all that work

969
00:50:20,682 --> 00:50:22,744
takes away from adding the new content to the game

970
00:50:22,764 --> 00:50:23,745
that we want to add.

971
00:50:24,506 --> 00:50:27,727
And it's important to note that nobody buys what they can't see.

972
00:50:27,987 --> 00:50:30,608
So it's really important to keep the game visible.

973
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:34,629
Anytime you can take advantage of a sale, do it.

974
00:50:34,769 --> 00:50:36,129
Combine it with a content update.

975
00:50:36,449 --> 00:50:38,770
It's kind of the way we roll.

976
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:42,131
If there's a sale happening, whether it's on Xbox or PSN or

977
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:45,132
Steam, we think, OK, what content update can we combine

978
00:50:45,152 --> 00:50:45,752
with that sale?

979
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:46,852
Let's put the game on sale.

980
00:50:47,393 --> 00:50:49,855
Let's get it out there promoted, visible,

981
00:50:50,195 --> 00:50:52,378
and in front of people so they can dive

982
00:50:52,418 --> 00:50:53,479
into that new content.

983
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,361
It's not just a sale for sales sake,

984
00:50:55,401 --> 00:50:56,582
it's a sale because there's something new.

985
00:50:56,602 --> 00:50:57,823
And that's really important.

986
00:50:58,484 --> 00:51:00,866
We really try to reinforce all of our updates,

987
00:51:00,906 --> 00:51:02,768
as we mentioned earlier, through more media.

988
00:51:03,369 --> 00:51:05,531
working with influencers and social channels

989
00:51:05,892 --> 00:51:07,453
so people have an actionable item.

990
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:09,415
When it comes to what's happening with ARK,

991
00:51:09,455 --> 00:51:11,177
they can go see something, watch something,

992
00:51:11,938 --> 00:51:14,961
buy the latest content if they don't own the game yet.

993
00:51:15,422 --> 00:51:18,585
And then really, it's doing all of that

994
00:51:18,625 --> 00:51:19,806
throughout all of development.

995
00:51:20,086 --> 00:51:22,369
And so, that's pretty much our spiel.

996
00:51:22,709 --> 00:51:24,231
So, thank you.

997
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:25,412
Thank you everybody.

998
00:51:33,054 --> 00:51:35,635
And I want to say thank you to everybody who's played ARK and enjoyed it.

999
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:36,856
We really wouldn't be here without you.

1000
00:51:37,176 --> 00:51:38,017
Exactly, yes.

1001
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,438
We are hiring, by the way, so notice.

1002
00:51:40,918 --> 00:51:44,460
We've got a booth, so if you are one of these people with these talents,

1003
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:45,360
please come talk to us.

1004
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:48,702
And we have time for questions if anyone has questions

1005
00:51:48,782 --> 00:51:52,964
about anything related to ARK development or design or anything we talked about.

1006
00:51:55,281 --> 00:51:59,164
Hey, I'm working on a fighting game called Fantasy Strike for Steam Early Access.

1007
00:51:59,564 --> 00:52:01,166
And I had actually two questions for you.

1008
00:52:01,306 --> 00:52:02,687
First about PlayStation 4.

1009
00:52:03,448 --> 00:52:06,910
You don't have the Early Access label there because there's no such thing,

1010
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:09,633
but you do have it on Xbox and Steam.

1011
00:52:09,733 --> 00:52:11,854
So how do you handle that?

1012
00:52:11,915 --> 00:52:16,038
Do you frame the exact same game as finished on one platform and not the other?

1013
00:52:16,518 --> 00:52:19,501
And the second question is that your slide at the very end

1014
00:52:19,561 --> 00:52:21,102
showed sales from 1 million to 7 million.

1015
00:52:22,243 --> 00:52:26,413
And most of your terrific talk was about kind of that journey from 1 million to 7 million.

1016
00:52:26,433 --> 00:52:30,002
But can you say something about how you were so incredibly successful?

1017
00:52:30,972 --> 00:52:32,592
with your first launch on early access.

1018
00:52:33,173 --> 00:52:33,393
Sure.

1019
00:52:33,413 --> 00:52:35,213
I'll give you a repeat question.

1020
00:52:35,234 --> 00:52:38,495
Okay, so the first question was about early access in PS4

1021
00:52:39,015 --> 00:52:40,376
and Ark's placement on PS4.

1022
00:52:40,736 --> 00:52:44,818
So Ark is technically not a early access title on PS4.

1023
00:52:44,998 --> 00:52:47,899
It's that moniker or program doesn't explicitly exist

1024
00:52:47,939 --> 00:52:49,420
at the present time on PS4.

1025
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,921
It is noted on the store as an unfinished game, however,

1026
00:52:53,081 --> 00:52:55,503
or the game will be receiving lots of updates.

1027
00:52:55,523 --> 00:52:55,943
Oh, really?

1028
00:52:56,143 --> 00:52:56,723
I didn't realize that.

1029
00:52:56,743 --> 00:52:56,943
Yes.

1030
00:52:59,044 --> 00:53:01,946
Specifically, we just asked Sony,

1031
00:53:02,486 --> 00:53:04,808
can we put an unfinished game on the platform

1032
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,629
as long as we're committing to finishing it

1033
00:53:06,669 --> 00:53:08,950
and rapidly updating it, and they said yes.

1034
00:53:09,411 --> 00:53:10,291
Well, it's also worth noting,

1035
00:53:10,331 --> 00:53:12,593
we had to actually pass full game cert,

1036
00:53:13,473 --> 00:53:15,654
which is not a requirement for Game Preview

1037
00:53:15,915 --> 00:53:16,915
or Steam, as you know.

1038
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:21,158
But for Sony's platform, you have to go through cert to even put your game on there.

1039
00:53:21,918 --> 00:53:26,921
Technically certified as a retail title, but planning, you know, updated on a weekly basis.

1040
00:53:27,001 --> 00:53:30,283
And Sony has really good back-end systems to update the game rapidly,

1041
00:53:30,363 --> 00:53:33,465
so it's made it very effective to operate in that way on that platform.

1042
00:53:33,845 --> 00:53:37,507
The second question was about how are we successful early on at launch.

1043
00:53:37,907 --> 00:53:42,130
And I mean, I think two things really play into that.

1044
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:44,411
Number one is, you know, having a...

1045
00:53:45,072 --> 00:53:49,313
a good idea that a large number of people are going to be interested in in the first place.

1046
00:53:49,554 --> 00:53:53,075
The, obviously, survival in dinosaurs was effective for us.

1047
00:53:53,655 --> 00:53:58,077
But secondly, it's the things we did around launch that really worked to our benefit.

1048
00:53:59,018 --> 00:54:03,499
Namely, right after launch, we were just updating the game five times a day.

1049
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:09,025
I don't think anybody has updated the game, their title on early access as much as we did with

1050
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:13,230
Arc for not just a day or a week or a month, but really the first six months. Now we've

1051
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:20,018
obviously more lately not slowed but focused on larger patches released less frequently. That's

1052
00:54:20,058 --> 00:54:22,120
in order to stabilize the technical state of the game.

1053
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:29,285
But very early on, our goal was to be there 24-7 to react to whatever issues were arising in the

1054
00:54:29,365 --> 00:54:33,669
online game day or night. And that was difficult, very, very difficult. But I think it really made

1055
00:54:33,689 --> 00:54:38,472
an impact because the launch of any online game is going to be very rocky and faced with a lot of

1056
00:54:38,532 --> 00:54:43,376
issues. And to the extent that we could, we tried to stay on top of them. And I think that helped

1057
00:54:43,436 --> 00:54:47,018
us continue the acceleration beyond the first few hours of launch.

1058
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,882
And all the stuff we talked about with the community team. That's a very challenging time for the

1059
00:54:50,902 --> 00:54:54,264
community team as well. They have to stay on top of the launch, talk to people, let them know

1060
00:54:54,284 --> 00:54:58,186
what's going on, get stuff back to us. So that's why everything we talked about, even though it

1061
00:54:58,226 --> 00:55:02,949
was about all of the success up until now, it was really forged in the fire of those early

1062
00:55:02,989 --> 00:55:07,051
launch days, how we dealt with updates, how we dealt with the community, and we just kept

1063
00:55:07,071 --> 00:55:10,914
doing it the rest of the time until now. So. Thanks a lot, guys.

1064
00:55:14,782 --> 00:55:19,787
Hi. First of all, my favorite GDC talks are ones where developers talk frankly about their

1065
00:55:19,827 --> 00:55:23,731
failures as well as successes. So thank you for addressing sheep gate. That was really

1066
00:55:23,811 --> 00:55:30,738
awesome. The question that I have is about you guys talked a lot about, you know,

1067
00:55:31,139 --> 00:55:35,462
getting community feedback being a part of your scorecard system for whether or not you want to

1068
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:40,447
implement a new feature. So if you are doing all this visible effort to get community

1069
00:55:40,507 --> 00:55:44,951
feedback on a potential new feature and then you decide not to do it, how do you break that to

1070
00:55:44,971 --> 00:55:48,614
the community? How do you go, you know, that can be a tricky point of communication. So

1071
00:55:48,634 --> 00:55:49,374
what's your strategy?

1072
00:55:49,985 --> 00:55:51,687
You know, that's a really good question.

1073
00:55:51,707 --> 00:55:54,551
The question was, when we inevitably are faced

1074
00:55:54,571 --> 00:55:56,414
with a feature that the community really wants,

1075
00:55:56,514 --> 00:55:58,517
maybe we've even solicited feedback from them

1076
00:55:58,777 --> 00:56:00,059
and then have to not do it

1077
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:03,264
because it doesn't meet our overall criteria afterwards

1078
00:56:03,384 --> 00:56:05,226
for inclusion into the game, how do we break that?

1079
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:08,888
to the community and not get skinned alive.

1080
00:56:09,348 --> 00:56:12,789
And the answer is unfortunately no good answer.

1081
00:56:13,389 --> 00:56:15,510
We have had to do that in the past.

1082
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:19,592
And usually it just involves a very mea culpa sorry post.

1083
00:56:20,352 --> 00:56:22,613
And what we usually try to do is time it

1084
00:56:23,553 --> 00:56:24,393
with some sweetener.

1085
00:56:24,473 --> 00:56:26,294
So we have good news, bad news type situation.

1086
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:31,217
news, you're getting something really cool that may be unrelated. Bad news, we had to cancel

1087
00:56:31,658 --> 00:56:36,261
this feature that you were looking forward to. And you'll get a set of players who will want

1088
00:56:36,281 --> 00:56:41,744
your head on a spike anyway, but at least there will be something to look forward to as well.

1089
00:56:41,784 --> 00:56:43,886
And that's the only thing you really can do at that point.

1090
00:56:46,868 --> 00:56:54,213
Hi, hello. I was wondering if after the early access you will wipe the servers?

1091
00:56:57,164 --> 00:56:58,645
That might be privileged information.

1092
00:57:00,026 --> 00:57:03,769
We are still considering what the best options are there,

1093
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:06,932
whether it's to add new servers or keep the existing ones.

1094
00:57:06,952 --> 00:57:08,694
We're leaning towards, at the present time,

1095
00:57:08,794 --> 00:57:09,614
adding new servers.

1096
00:57:09,835 --> 00:57:12,917
We certainly have resources, financial resources.

1097
00:57:12,977 --> 00:57:16,560
So while having a lot of servers is costly,

1098
00:57:17,301 --> 00:57:20,063
when you look at the grand scope of player investment

1099
00:57:20,143 --> 00:57:21,224
and new players,

1100
00:57:22,725 --> 00:57:24,186
We're leaning towards adding new servers,

1101
00:57:24,266 --> 00:57:27,348
but honestly, we're gonna continue to kind of evaluate

1102
00:57:27,468 --> 00:57:29,889
the situation as we get closer to launch.

1103
00:57:30,889 --> 00:57:32,790
But that is, with any online game,

1104
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:33,971
that goes through early access,

1105
00:57:34,031 --> 00:57:37,913
a challenge about how often you wipe, if you wipe at all,

1106
00:57:37,973 --> 00:57:40,194
and what do you do when you have a bunch of new players

1107
00:57:40,254 --> 00:57:43,776
coming in during the inevitable retail influx.

1108
00:57:44,196 --> 00:57:46,917
And so, we don't have a perfect solution,

1109
00:57:46,957 --> 00:57:48,498
but we're gonna be keeping an eye on that

1110
00:57:48,518 --> 00:57:50,539
and figuring it out as we get closer to the launch date.

1111
00:57:50,739 --> 00:57:58,508
Thank you. And also, please, if you can add a queue system. We would greatly appreciate it.

1112
00:58:02,754 --> 00:58:03,434
are thinking about it.

1113
00:58:03,474 --> 00:58:07,095
It's really technically complicated, but yeah, it's just.

1114
00:58:07,435 --> 00:58:09,876
How much is the scorecard?

1115
00:58:10,356 --> 00:58:12,257
On the technical complication side,

1116
00:58:12,277 --> 00:58:14,097
that would definitely be an X,

1117
00:58:14,437 --> 00:58:16,318
but definitely, I understand your pain

1118
00:58:16,338 --> 00:58:17,538
if you're on console especially.

1119
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:17,738
Yes.

1120
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:18,859
Thank you.

1121
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,599
I spent Christmas, around Christmas.

1122
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:28,882
and cleaning dishes, pressing X every 30 seconds. We saw somebody made a mechanical device to

1123
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:34,024
press A button over and over again to try and join a server. That was the arc cue system.

1124
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:37,006
That was a YouTube video. Sounds like there's a solution. Why do we need to implement

1125
00:58:37,066 --> 00:58:44,929
anything? Okay, thank you. Thanks. So I had a question. You touched on the end about using

1126
00:58:44,969 --> 00:58:49,451
influencers to sort of disseminate information. And I know from the beginning of the early

1127
00:58:49,491 --> 00:58:51,371
access, you had a very robust influencer program.

1128
00:58:52,062 --> 00:58:56,253
So how did you go about spinning that up, getting streamers and other influencers into the fold

1129
00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:59,682
and putting out regular content about the game and sort of building that community?

1130
00:59:00,365 --> 00:59:05,087
So the question was about influencers and how we kind of build up that sort of community, I guess, around it.

1131
00:59:05,847 --> 00:59:13,889
One thing I would say, I wasn't just talking about influencers in the terms of, you know, voicing the game and, you know, we're trying to get them to get the word out.

1132
00:59:14,969 --> 00:59:22,272
Influencers in the sense of content creators, like on YouTube, Twitch, people that are creating content for the game or they have their own fan bases.

1133
00:59:22,692 --> 00:59:25,555
And we really try to reinforce their popularity,

1134
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:29,180
give them cool stuff to work with,

1135
00:59:29,801 --> 00:59:31,663
report on from the game's development.

1136
00:59:31,923 --> 00:59:34,567
Occasionally, we've done like an early look at something,

1137
00:59:34,607 --> 00:59:35,768
but we tend not to work that way

1138
00:59:35,788 --> 00:59:38,171
because we're always so close to launch.

1139
00:59:38,732 --> 00:59:40,694
But it's important with the influencers, I think,

1140
00:59:40,734 --> 00:59:42,516
to reinforce the good work they are doing.

1141
00:59:42,857 --> 00:59:46,898
If we have a video that we think is good from a content creator, we'll retweet it.

1142
00:59:47,319 --> 00:59:50,500
We'll give props to people that are creating content for the game.

1143
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:55,783
If it's, you know, a music video or it's a funny comic that somebody's made,

1144
00:59:56,123 --> 00:59:58,364
those type of influencers are not like direct,

1145
00:59:58,484 --> 01:00:00,105
oh, I'm playing the game, watch me on Twitch.

1146
01:00:00,445 --> 01:00:03,326
Those are influencers that are spreading the word about the game.

1147
01:00:03,346 --> 01:00:05,147
And I think that's kind of the answer for us,

1148
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,728
is reinforcing that relationship by...

1149
01:00:08,509 --> 01:00:11,793
being an amplifier to the stuff people are doing about our game

1150
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:15,457
outside of us. I think we're almost done. Was that the no

1151
01:00:15,477 --> 01:00:19,923
more questions signal? We'll hang around a little bit.
