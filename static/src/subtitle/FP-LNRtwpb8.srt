1
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:11,764
So this is Precision of Emotion, a new kind of fun approach.

2
00:00:13,517 --> 00:00:17,297
So I like to do stupidly hard things.

3
00:00:17,297 --> 00:00:20,858
And so this is my first game design talk.

4
00:00:20,858 --> 00:00:24,039
And I have what I think is a new approach to defining

5
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:24,519
what fun is.

6
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:27,019
And there's a new word associated with it.

7
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,340
Both of these are stupid things to do in game design theory.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,020
And I know what you're thinking.

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,041
It's like, oh god, another one.

10
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:35,281
And it's going to be another word.

11
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:36,901
Somebody shoot me.

12
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:39,402
But just stay with me, and we'll see if I

13
00:00:39,402 --> 00:00:40,442
can defend this thesis.

14
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:47,556
So you all know Raph Koster's Theory of Fun, one of the great works on game design, right?

15
00:00:47,556 --> 00:00:49,597
Everybody knows this?

16
00:00:49,597 --> 00:00:50,998
Okay, good.

17
00:00:50,998 --> 00:00:53,959
So Raph is over there, and he said,

18
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:55,740
that's what games are in the end.

19
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,620
Teachers, fun is just another word for learning.

20
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,522
So when I went to work at the Glass Lab, we thought,

21
00:01:00,522 --> 00:01:02,462
well, holy cow, this is our chance.

22
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:04,043
We're making educational games.

23
00:01:04,043 --> 00:01:07,084
Fun is learning. Therefore, this should be super easy.

24
00:01:07,084 --> 00:01:10,986
And this is based on a lot of thinking from James Paul Gee's work, I hope you know as well.

25
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:13,367
Going all the way back to Lev Vygotsky, most known

26
00:01:13,367 --> 00:01:17,168
for the flow state, or the zone of proximal development,

27
00:01:17,168 --> 00:01:18,108
a.k.a.

28
00:01:18,108 --> 00:01:19,469
what we all do in games.

29
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:22,930
And so if you dig deep into this,

30
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,051
you get Jesse Schell at the top, who says fun isn't important,

31
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:28,092
which I think is a valid thesis about game design.

32
00:01:28,092 --> 00:01:29,532
Raph saying fun is learning.

33
00:01:29,532 --> 00:01:31,273
Jim G saying fun is the scientific method.

34
00:01:31,273 --> 00:01:35,995
And then Piaget, Fred Rogers, all the way down to Vygotsky,

35
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,695
play as a self-actualizing tool of the mind that maximizes

36
00:01:38,695 --> 00:01:39,876
the zone of proximal development.

37
00:01:40,376 --> 00:01:47,238
You can keep going all the way down, and you get down to neuroscience, which I'd like to get into, but that's a completely different talk.

38
00:01:47,238 --> 00:01:49,439
She might be wondering who the heck I am.

39
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,200
So, I said I like to do stupidly hard things.

40
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,362
This graph I use to display why I kind of tend to jump around between subjects.

41
00:01:58,362 --> 00:02:00,522
I like things that are really difficult before they've taken off.

42
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:03,383
As soon as they start to become financially successful, I flee.

43
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:12,795
So, two years ago I joined the Glass Lab, and this is one of the longest times I think I've been with a company, except for the very first company I was with.

44
00:02:12,795 --> 00:02:21,086
We recently released Mars Generation 1, our Gubot Academy, which is set on Mars in collaboration with NASA and the National Writing Project.

45
00:02:21,466 --> 00:02:24,267
An RPG Pokemon game with robots to teach argumentation

46
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:25,827
to middle schoolers.

47
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:27,507
And we recently released a finding study

48
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:30,768
on that that shows a great leap forward up

49
00:02:30,768 --> 00:02:32,629
to a year of gain in argumentation

50
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:34,149
based on about three hours of play

51
00:02:34,149 --> 00:02:35,369
and two hours of curriculum.

52
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:36,890
So we're really pleased with that.

53
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,750
Glass Lab, just to give you a bit more detail,

54
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,570
people tend to get very curious, was started in 2012

55
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:45,832
and was a three-year grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates

56
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,052
Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation

57
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:50,153
to create formative assessment-based learning

58
00:02:50,153 --> 00:02:50,413
games.

59
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,111
We can talk a lot about that later,

60
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:54,252
but that's also another big topic.

61
00:02:54,252 --> 00:02:57,474
So when GlassLab started, we were

62
00:02:57,474 --> 00:02:59,816
given SimCity by Electronic Arts,

63
00:02:59,816 --> 00:03:01,937
which was an amazing thing.

64
00:03:01,937 --> 00:03:03,658
And we looked at SimCity and thought,

65
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:04,859
we can teach anything with SimCity.

66
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:05,640
There's so many things.

67
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,760
We can teach water systems.

68
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,481
We can teach civics.

69
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:09,142
We can teach argumentation.

70
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:10,643
Anything is possible within SimCity

71
00:03:10,643 --> 00:03:14,426
because it is an innately learning-oriented product.

72
00:03:14,426 --> 00:03:15,967
It's the thing that teachers think about when they think

73
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:16,687
about learning in games.

74
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:17,327
It'll be perfect.

75
00:03:18,028 --> 00:03:20,949
And so then we put the game in front of kids all by itself

76
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:22,030
in a school setting.

77
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,311
And they said, well, this is pretty fun,

78
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:26,412
but we weren't learning anything.

79
00:03:26,412 --> 00:03:27,633
So why are you wasting our time?

80
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:30,114
And it was really surprising to us

81
00:03:30,114 --> 00:03:32,115
that kids in that particular setting

82
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:33,156
are hungry for learning.

83
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:35,117
There was a deep satisfaction and actually

84
00:03:35,117 --> 00:03:37,198
a deep affective state that they went

85
00:03:37,198 --> 00:03:38,859
into when they were learning that was not

86
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:40,900
what we were used to seeing from when they were playing games

87
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,361
and when they were having fun.

88
00:03:43,918 --> 00:03:46,941
And so I realized fun is learning is the beginning.

89
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:47,881
It's not the end.

90
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:49,903
And there is so much more that we

91
00:03:49,903 --> 00:03:52,204
have to learn about the learning process

92
00:03:52,204 --> 00:03:54,826
and how it applies to fun, how it is distinctive emotionally

93
00:03:54,826 --> 00:03:55,827
from fun.

94
00:03:55,827 --> 00:03:58,128
And this affective state that kids went into

95
00:03:58,128 --> 00:04:00,690
was incredibly fascinating to me.

96
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:01,691
I couldn't place it.

97
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:03,192
It was actually kind of a new state.

98
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,495
And you need really good teachers to create it,

99
00:04:06,495 --> 00:04:08,217
or really good products to create it.

100
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:10,500
And I was talking to one of our learning designers

101
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,203
about how you might look at that affective state.

102
00:04:13,203 --> 00:04:15,546
And I said, you know, has anybody ever tried

103
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,449
to identify a palette of universal emotions?

104
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:19,893
And he said, yeah.

105
00:04:19,893 --> 00:04:22,134
There's a guy named Paul Ekman, who

106
00:04:22,134 --> 00:04:24,155
did a study, probably one of the studies

107
00:04:24,155 --> 00:04:25,356
that he's most well-known for.

108
00:04:25,356 --> 00:04:28,037
He's actually the basis for the show Lie to Me,

109
00:04:28,037 --> 00:04:31,179
where he was connecting emotional states

110
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:32,560
to facial expressions.

111
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,581
And he took a whole bunch of photographs

112
00:04:34,581 --> 00:04:37,603
all over the world of people having different emotions

113
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:39,804
and asked people in all different countries

114
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:40,945
to identify what was going on.

115
00:04:41,045 --> 00:04:43,227
And then they dropped all of this all the way down

116
00:04:43,227 --> 00:04:45,269
and found seven universal emotions.

117
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:47,451
It was six initially, and then a seventh one was added.

118
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:51,715
So there's disgust, contempt, sadness, happiness, fear,

119
00:04:51,715 --> 00:04:54,358
anger, and surprise, universal across all cultures

120
00:04:54,358 --> 00:04:55,058
and all people.

121
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:56,478
But where's fun?

122
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,339
None of these seemed individually to be fun.

123
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:01,420
Some of them were sort of related,

124
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,360
like definitely sadness sometimes.

125
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,921
Like if you played Final Fantasy VII,

126
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:08,442
you would experience this terrible sadness.

127
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,742
Happiness seemed to be pretty close.

128
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:12,323
Surprise seemed really important,

129
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:14,304
but none of them individually seemed

130
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:15,764
to be hitting this thing that was fun.

131
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,015
And eventually what I realized was that fun wasn't one emotion.

132
00:05:22,015 --> 00:05:24,157
It was a process between multiple emotions.

133
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,199
It was something that was arrived on,

134
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,541
or an affective state that was emergent out

135
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,303
of multiple emotions that actually

136
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:32,645
seemed to have a consistent sequence.

137
00:05:32,645 --> 00:05:34,326
And that seemed really interesting.

138
00:05:34,326 --> 00:05:35,107
So here comes the word.

139
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,392
I call it SOFIA, the Game Learn Emotion.

140
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:45,815
And I think it's the cognitive process by which we convert

141
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:47,696
fear into happiness through surprise.

142
00:05:47,696 --> 00:05:50,638
So you can look at it as this transitional state where

143
00:05:50,638 --> 00:05:53,780
initially you're fearful, and then you have this moment

144
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,261
of realization and delight, and then you feel super happy.

145
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:59,103
And this process actually deeply does

146
00:05:59,103 --> 00:06:02,345
connect with a lot of the stuff that Lev Vygotsky said

147
00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:05,427
and Piaget has said about what happens when kids play.

148
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:10,142
So I want to talk about microbes.

149
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:13,183
So how many microbes live in your body?

150
00:06:13,183 --> 00:06:16,525
Are there biologists in the room or people who are bio nerds?

151
00:06:16,525 --> 00:06:16,965
They might know.

152
00:06:16,965 --> 00:06:18,365
Any guesses?

153
00:06:18,365 --> 00:06:18,745
A lot.

154
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:22,547
How many lot?

155
00:06:22,547 --> 00:06:22,867
A trillion?

156
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:23,907
All right.

157
00:06:23,907 --> 00:06:24,607
You guys are ringers.

158
00:06:24,607 --> 00:06:25,988
Yeah.

159
00:06:25,988 --> 00:06:28,449
Actually, it's 100 trillion microbes per person.

160
00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:30,689
They outnumber human cells 10 to 1.

161
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:33,670
You have 1,000 species of microbes in your gut alone

162
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,011
and 200 on the surface of your eye.

163
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:37,412
So you're disrupting a lot of them when you blink.

164
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:39,720
How do you guys feel?

165
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,304
How do you feel?

166
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:45,085
Creepy.

167
00:06:45,085 --> 00:06:45,705
Creepy?

168
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,587
It's gross, right?

169
00:06:47,587 --> 00:06:47,788
Blech.

170
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:48,869
Do not want.

171
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:49,069
Right?

172
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:55,115
So, if you think about the Milky Way, there's 100 billion stars in the galaxy.

173
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:57,557
Your body has 100 trillion microbes in it.

174
00:06:57,557 --> 00:06:59,139
Biologists call this the microbiome.

175
00:07:00,127 --> 00:07:01,929
And there have been recent studies, including this one,

176
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:04,911
that says this, Piper Hoffman, no relation,

177
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:07,413
red meat changes your gut bacteria to cause heart disease.

178
00:07:07,413 --> 00:07:10,015
So basically, when you eat red meat,

179
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:11,416
if you're a meat eater,

180
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,318
you get this bloom of chemical in your body

181
00:07:14,318 --> 00:07:16,080
that then is converted into stuff

182
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,461
that will eventually give you heart disease.

183
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:19,783
However, if you're a vegan and you eat a steak,

184
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:20,323
doesn't happen.

185
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:22,931
So biologists noticed this and they said,

186
00:07:22,931 --> 00:07:24,612
dude, what is going on?

187
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,294
And it turns out there's a gut bacteria

188
00:07:26,294 --> 00:07:27,475
that releases that bloom.

189
00:07:27,475 --> 00:07:29,157
And they think now that that might

190
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,618
be what causes heart disease.

191
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:32,279
So if you kind of oscillate back and forth

192
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,801
between eating meat and not eating meat,

193
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,162
you probably could avoid heart disease.

194
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:36,443
So there's really interesting things

195
00:07:36,443 --> 00:07:37,945
that are now just being discovered

196
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:39,906
out of what's called the second genome.

197
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:42,108
This biome that's inside of us is really more

198
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:45,151
like a coral reef and is 10 to one,

199
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,453
more than we are in our human cells ourselves.

200
00:07:49,683 --> 00:07:50,983
Oh, I'm missing a slide.

201
00:07:50,983 --> 00:07:51,323
Sadness.

202
00:07:51,323 --> 00:07:52,283
How do you feel now?

203
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:54,844
Good.

204
00:07:54,844 --> 00:07:55,564
Thumbs up.

205
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:56,004
Right?

206
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:56,524
Better.

207
00:07:56,524 --> 00:07:56,944
Yeah.

208
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:57,564
Man, I got a grip on it.

209
00:07:57,564 --> 00:08:00,225
It's a super weird thing, and I understand it now.

210
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:01,585
And again, that's what I think SOFIA is.

211
00:08:01,585 --> 00:08:04,206
I think it's the process by which you confront

212
00:08:04,206 --> 00:08:07,366
this creepiness and this, oh, man, something foreign.

213
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:08,026
Go, go away.

214
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:08,506
I don't want it.

215
00:08:08,506 --> 00:08:10,007
And then you realize, wait a minute,

216
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:11,187
I'm starting to get a grip on this.

217
00:08:11,187 --> 00:08:13,848
And then you say, oh, now I know more about the world.

218
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:14,768
My slide was out of order.

219
00:08:14,768 --> 00:08:15,348
Sorry about that.

220
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:20,760
So games, some games have more Sophia than others,

221
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,420
which is interesting.

222
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,581
And I think these are the games that we

223
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:26,303
tend to think about as either smart fun or learning fun games.

224
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:28,845
And if we kind of put them all together and look at them,

225
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:30,946
I think partly what we see is that they

226
00:08:30,946 --> 00:08:32,467
have some sort of connection to the real world.

227
00:08:32,467 --> 00:08:34,889
There's some kind of exploration that's going on

228
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,130
and some kind of discovery.

229
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,731
And you're creating order out of chaos.

230
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:39,692
And then when you have that ordered state

231
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:41,373
that you've created in the world,

232
00:08:41,373 --> 00:08:43,294
you have this deep satisfaction about yourself.

233
00:08:43,294 --> 00:08:44,315
You feel mastery.

234
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,296
You feel understanding.

235
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:48,221
you feel actually like you have a bit more of a grip on your life.

236
00:08:48,221 --> 00:08:51,306
And by the way, these feelings might

237
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:53,309
be missing from formal education today,

238
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:56,094
which might be part of why there's so much effort

239
00:08:56,094 --> 00:08:57,356
to bring games into education.

240
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,503
So at Glass Lab, we talk about meaningful games.

241
00:09:01,503 --> 00:09:03,024
And I gave a keynote at Meaningful Play.

242
00:09:03,024 --> 00:09:04,505
I think Casey might be here somewhere.

243
00:09:04,505 --> 00:09:07,187
When we talk about a meaningful game,

244
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:09,189
we draw a distinction between a game that

245
00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:11,431
connects to the real world and a game that does not

246
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:12,492
connect to the real world.

247
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:14,293
So Candy Crush is a great game.

248
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:15,674
I played a lot of Candy Crush.

249
00:09:15,674 --> 00:09:19,597
It's very engaging, and it has a certain kind of satisfaction

250
00:09:19,597 --> 00:09:21,479
because it is so completely disconnected

251
00:09:21,479 --> 00:09:22,219
from the real world.

252
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:22,920
It's an escape.

253
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,882
But it's not sticky.

254
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:26,343
I'm not sure I'm going to remember

255
00:09:26,343 --> 00:09:28,866
that I played Candy Crush a lot five or 10 years from now.

256
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:31,188
However, Journey I will remember forever,

257
00:09:31,188 --> 00:09:34,191
because the systems inside of Journey changed me.

258
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:35,512
And I think about my relationship

259
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:37,574
to eternal recurrence and the rest of the world

260
00:09:37,574 --> 00:09:39,256
differently now that I've finished playing Journey.

261
00:09:39,256 --> 00:09:41,318
So I think that's an important distinction

262
00:09:41,318 --> 00:09:43,920
to make within games, not in terms of quality,

263
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,822
but in terms of the effect that it's having on the player.

264
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:50,118
And if some games have more Sophia than others,

265
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:52,178
it got me thinking about how can we actually

266
00:09:52,178 --> 00:09:54,019
categorize games differently than just

267
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:54,979
according to their mechanics.

268
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:57,460
I think that if you look at games

269
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,720
as a comparison between the core emotion

270
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,661
that the game itself is evoking, you

271
00:10:01,661 --> 00:10:03,681
start to get a really interesting hierarchy.

272
00:10:03,681 --> 00:10:06,102
And I would like to see the rest of this built out.

273
00:10:06,102 --> 00:10:08,643
There's the fear genre of Silent Hill.

274
00:10:09,063 --> 00:10:11,925
and amnesia that just makes you feel afraid in so many ways

275
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:14,867
and has you confront all of these horror concepts.

276
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:16,788
There's the together genre, which

277
00:10:16,788 --> 00:10:18,869
you can see this kind of esoteric collection of games

278
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:21,391
that really evoke this emotion of togetherness

279
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:24,713
and knowing other people and knowing how human beings work.

280
00:10:24,713 --> 00:10:27,134
And then there's, I think, a relatively new,

281
00:10:27,134 --> 00:10:29,076
or there's some old games, but these games

282
00:10:29,076 --> 00:10:31,557
are becoming bigger, the complicity genre with Papers,

283
00:10:31,557 --> 00:10:33,498
Please and Sweatshop in it, which

284
00:10:33,498 --> 00:10:35,660
is my favorite new genre that actually

285
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,201
has this very complex emotion of.

286
00:10:37,781 --> 00:10:42,684
initial engagement, and then mastery over a system,

287
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:46,447
and then, shit, what have I done?

288
00:10:46,447 --> 00:10:48,929
This is a very complex emotion, really fascinating.

289
00:10:48,929 --> 00:10:51,911
But within all of those genres, because Sophia

290
00:10:51,911 --> 00:10:54,232
is the game emotion, there's Sophia in all of them.

291
00:10:54,232 --> 00:10:57,334
So you can take two games, like God of War and Animal Crossing.

292
00:10:57,334 --> 00:10:59,836
In God of War, you're going to discover controls.

293
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:01,837
It has this really elegant tutorial system

294
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:04,739
that leads you to think that you are achieving your own mastery

295
00:11:04,739 --> 00:11:05,800
over these controls.

296
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,481
that are eventually going to make you feel extremely powerful

297
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:09,761
once you have them.

298
00:11:09,761 --> 00:11:13,503
In Animal Crossing, even though it's a completely open sandbox

299
00:11:13,503 --> 00:11:16,323
game with all of the emergent narrative very whimsical,

300
00:11:16,323 --> 00:11:18,684
it has this fish loop in it and many other loops,

301
00:11:18,684 --> 00:11:20,885
such as digging up fossils, that give you

302
00:11:20,885 --> 00:11:23,526
a mastery sense that make you feel very grounded and mastered

303
00:11:23,526 --> 00:11:24,466
in that world.

304
00:11:24,706 --> 00:11:30,467
So, and I think in both of these games, you're still finding the fear in God of War getting

305
00:11:30,467 --> 00:11:31,547
destroyed.

306
00:11:31,547 --> 00:11:37,548
And then you're getting surprised and delighted, and eventually you're reaching happiness because

307
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:38,289
you have this feeling of mastery.

308
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:42,409
So Sophia is the process, and it drives the core.

309
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:45,810
The feelings of mastery in God of War create fear.

310
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,490
They create dominance.

311
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,131
Feelings of mastery in Animal Crossing create a sense of togetherness, a feeling of understanding

312
00:11:52,131 --> 00:11:53,832
people and being connected to them.

313
00:11:56,378 --> 00:11:57,720
Oops, so when we follow this down,

314
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,961
I just gave that away completely.

315
00:11:58,961 --> 00:11:59,541
That sucked.

316
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,523
OK, I was going to see if you could

317
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:05,767
identify these games based on their loops themselves.

318
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,910
Let's take, I guess, the one on it's my left.

319
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,931
I'm not sure if it's your left.

320
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,353
Aim, shoot, and watch.

321
00:12:12,353 --> 00:12:15,195
Anybody who did not see the slide want to guess.

322
00:12:17,557 --> 00:12:18,698
No, it's too much anyway.

323
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:22,501
So these two loops, I think, are very interesting

324
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:24,402
because you can take the individual mechanics that

325
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:27,124
form their core loop and bring them back together

326
00:12:27,124 --> 00:12:30,087
to create a core emotion.

327
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:32,749
Now, in the case of Angry Birds on the left,

328
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:35,331
the dissonance between these core mechanics

329
00:12:35,331 --> 00:12:37,973
creates this wackiness in combination

330
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:41,096
with destruction that gives the game an extremely unique feel.

331
00:12:41,576 --> 00:12:43,497
However, the World of Warcraft loop

332
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:46,219
creates something that's this fantasy adventure power feeling

333
00:12:46,219 --> 00:12:48,540
that's a very widely and deeply explored

334
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,501
genre in games in general.

335
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:51,302
So you could apply the World of Warcraft loop

336
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:53,023
to all kinds of different games.

337
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,124
What unifies them is their core emotion.

338
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:57,165
But that core emotion emerges from

339
00:12:57,165 --> 00:12:58,606
the individual mechanical connections

340
00:12:58,606 --> 00:13:00,647
between the verbs that form the heart of the game.

341
00:13:04,765 --> 00:13:06,467
So when we're making learning games,

342
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:10,991
and I think it's very integral to why all of these thoughts

343
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,993
emerge from the process of making learning games,

344
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,434
we have an effect we want to achieve,

345
00:13:14,434 --> 00:13:15,715
which is that the player at the end

346
00:13:15,715 --> 00:13:17,737
should actually be able to perform something

347
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:19,679
that prior to playing the game they could not perform.

348
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,500
It's very specific.

349
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,122
But it is not effective.

350
00:13:23,122 --> 00:13:25,564
Mostly, it's not emotional, not unless you force it to be.

351
00:13:26,085 --> 00:13:29,728
So, when we thought about how could we make this into an actual great game,

352
00:13:29,728 --> 00:13:31,970
instead of something that's just very performance-based,

353
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,112
and a lot of the sort of educational games that we think of as not being...

354
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:38,716
When we say they're not games, there's a lot of things that we're saying,

355
00:13:38,716 --> 00:13:40,997
but partly I think what we're saying is that they're not very emotional,

356
00:13:40,997 --> 00:13:42,639
and they're not creating an emotional effect.

357
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,440
So when we thought about argumentation...

358
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:48,102
we thought about what progression of emotions

359
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:50,023
do we want to have that would make you feel

360
00:13:50,023 --> 00:13:51,984
as though you had mastery over this competency.

361
00:13:51,984 --> 00:13:54,606
It's a little bit tricky because there's a lot we have to do

362
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:56,747
to achieve the actual effect of increasing

363
00:13:56,747 --> 00:13:58,368
your argumentation competency,

364
00:13:58,368 --> 00:14:00,109
but I think there's an emotional progression

365
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:02,450
we have to take the player through too if we're doing well,

366
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,071
which is to say, here's the feeling of mastery

367
00:14:05,071 --> 00:14:06,372
over this particular competency

368
00:14:06,372 --> 00:14:08,593
that's really more in a guitar hero space.

369
00:14:08,593 --> 00:14:11,094
Guitar hero is not gonna make you better at playing guitar,

370
00:14:11,094 --> 00:14:13,055
but you will feel like you're better at playing guitar.

371
00:14:13,616 --> 00:14:15,104
And that's very motivating, right?

372
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,114
It makes you think, I want that thing.

373
00:14:18,584 --> 00:14:21,485
And emotions, it turns out, can be pretty complicated.

374
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:24,087
I think our approach in what we're

375
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:26,368
trying to do with these games is actually ultimately

376
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:27,508
to alleviate suffering.

377
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:30,370
If you look at Sophia Loop, that fear

378
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,290
is already existing inside of a person.

379
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,911
They just kind of don't know that it's there.

380
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:36,192
If you have an absence in your world model,

381
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:39,354
you actually are going to be feeling

382
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:41,215
bad things about that absence.

383
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,015
If we can identify what that is, then we

384
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:44,976
can create a context by which we can tell a player,

385
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:46,337
here's why you want to do this thing.

386
00:14:46,857 --> 00:14:49,859
For the most part, in games that are pure entertainment games,

387
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:52,441
we don't have to say why you should do something.

388
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:54,762
I don't need a why for why I'm going to kill the dragon.

389
00:14:54,762 --> 00:14:57,084
I'm going to kill the dragon because the dragon is there.

390
00:14:57,084 --> 00:14:58,645
And that's a lot harder when you're

391
00:14:58,645 --> 00:15:01,767
talking about Pascal's triangle or the quadratic equation.

392
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:05,709
And the thing is, what if Pascal's triangle is actually

393
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:07,510
way more important than killing the dragon?

394
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:08,211
You have a problem.

395
00:15:08,211 --> 00:15:09,591
You have to actually articulate the why.

396
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:13,794
So the why for us with argumentation was,

397
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:17,592
If you don't have argumentation, you're a little bit helpless

398
00:15:17,592 --> 00:15:18,772
in the world of people.

399
00:15:18,772 --> 00:15:20,013
You're socially not effective.

400
00:15:20,013 --> 00:15:22,893
You can't persuade people that what you think is important.

401
00:15:22,893 --> 00:15:23,994
You're confused.

402
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:27,154
You can't articulate the things that are important to you.

403
00:15:27,154 --> 00:15:29,275
So if we could reverse this and address

404
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:31,115
the pain of absence of argumentation,

405
00:15:31,115 --> 00:15:34,396
we would create something that makes clarity and structure,

406
00:15:34,396 --> 00:15:36,977
wittiness, and that you have this compelling effect

407
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,937
on the people around you because you're so persuasive

408
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:41,678
and that persuasion is grounded in reason and logic.

409
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:49,778
So the theory of this is nice, but what do we do with it?

410
00:15:49,778 --> 00:15:53,720
I think that Sophia is a lens through which

411
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,000
we can view games.

412
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,883
I think that we can identify lots of problems

413
00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:01,244
that emerge from the absence of this process

414
00:16:01,244 --> 00:16:02,625
being clearly articulated.

415
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:05,466
This is sort of adjacent to ideas about

416
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:08,488
ludonarrative dissonance, if the performance of something

417
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:13,450
is different than the narrative that is given to the player.

418
00:16:13,983 --> 00:16:17,725
It's more abstract to say, what if your core emotion is either

419
00:16:17,725 --> 00:16:21,186
not what you intend it to be or is out of alignment

420
00:16:21,186 --> 00:16:22,027
with itself?

421
00:16:22,027 --> 00:16:24,228
What if the core verbs that you're asking a player

422
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:27,370
to perform over and over don't create the emotion

423
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,591
that you hope that you want players to achieve?

424
00:16:30,591 --> 00:16:33,073
I've seen a lot of games and a lot of processes of games

425
00:16:33,073 --> 00:16:35,734
where we don't even really think about how do we want

426
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:36,914
the player to feel at the end.

427
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:40,856
Or how we want the player to feel at the end

428
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:40,957
is.

429
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,072
good, or having fun, or engaged,

430
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:46,133
and not something very precise,

431
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:49,375
which has to do with the absence of the game

432
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,518
before the presence of it and how it changes you.

433
00:16:52,518 --> 00:16:54,900
I think a lot of times there can be not enough surprise

434
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,740
preceding satisfaction.

435
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,443
This is a particular problem inside of educational games

436
00:16:59,443 --> 00:17:01,405
where you can guide a player through something,

437
00:17:01,405 --> 00:17:03,386
actually it's in social games too,

438
00:17:03,386 --> 00:17:06,609
but if you don't allow them to discover for themselves

439
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,050
what is supposed to happen next,

440
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,611
the experience feels very flat.

441
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:15,136
If you don't clearly illuminate the fear and the why,

442
00:17:15,136 --> 00:17:17,658
you can also have a lack of tension in the game,

443
00:17:17,658 --> 00:17:20,781
a lack of reason to play that ultimately manifests

444
00:17:20,781 --> 00:17:22,362
as lost retention.

445
00:17:22,362 --> 00:17:25,244
And by the way, all of these things together

446
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,606
are the same problems you would have

447
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:28,407
if you were trying to teach someone something.

448
00:17:28,407 --> 00:17:31,070
So I wanted to leave some time for Q and A

449
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,253
because this is a very prototype idea

450
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:36,554
and I'm hoping to get some help with it.

451
00:17:36,554 --> 00:17:38,376
So I think that's where we are.

452
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,842
Oh, hi Erin, great talk.

453
00:17:53,842 --> 00:17:55,283
Edwin McCray, narrative designer.

454
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:59,266
I was wanting to know how important you feel

455
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:02,168
story and narrative is in the,

456
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:04,589
creating the, sort of, Sophia process.

457
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:09,512
That's a really interesting and difficult question.

458
00:18:09,512 --> 00:18:12,694
I think, you know, it's funny, when I came to Glass Lab,

459
00:18:12,694 --> 00:18:15,215
I believed very strongly that it should be

460
00:18:15,215 --> 00:18:17,697
all about the mechanics, and that if we leaned on story,

461
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,698
we were going to be, it would be because

462
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:21,059
we had an absence in our mechanics.

463
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:23,876
And I came to realize through watching a lot of kids play

464
00:18:23,876 --> 00:18:26,537
that human beings learn through story.

465
00:18:26,537 --> 00:18:27,477
It's how we learn everything.

466
00:18:27,477 --> 00:18:32,179
And so to leave that behind and to resist it was very foolish.

467
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:34,180
I think it's incredibly important,

468
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,941
and I think it falls into that ludonarrative dissonance

469
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:39,321
place, where you want the narrative to be serving

470
00:18:39,321 --> 00:18:40,482
the performance of the game.

471
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:42,682
You can't not have that performance and mechanic

472
00:18:42,682 --> 00:18:46,324
present, but you also can't have the story absent either.

473
00:18:46,324 --> 00:18:48,504
Thank you.

474
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:50,285
Thanks, Lee.

475
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:57,056
Okay, no other questions. I guess that's it.

476
00:18:57,056 --> 00:18:57,136
Oh, no.

477
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,579
I don't know what my question is yet, but I know that I have a question.

478
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:07,284
So, let me try to struggle through this.

479
00:19:07,284 --> 00:19:08,505
Um, sorry.

480
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:17,133
So, you're talking a lot about emotions in games, and I'm trying to identify for myself with the themes I'm experiencing here at GDC,

481
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:18,934
one of which is the threat of, like,

482
00:19:19,978 --> 00:19:25,781
Should we as game designers be starting to look at emotions other than the emotions that we are

483
00:19:25,781 --> 00:19:29,002
sort of using as a crutch for the majority of games that we're working on?

484
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:33,724
We should probably fall into the Fiero genre a lot.

485
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:40,287
And then I remembered from the Microtalks of the...

486
00:19:40,287 --> 00:19:42,348
Oh, I have the notes right here. I swear.

487
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:45,390
Take your time, we've got a few minutes.

488
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,652
The microtalk on interpersonal...

489
00:19:51,652 --> 00:19:54,373
Somebody help me out.

490
00:19:54,373 --> 00:19:58,194
The person was talking about specifically,

491
00:19:58,194 --> 00:20:03,616
for example, in games like Shadow of the Colossus,

492
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:07,757
where you feel a connection to an NPC that is

493
00:20:07,757 --> 00:20:09,978
sort of beyond the connection that you would have to a normal...

494
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:22,997
Yeah, Matt Fock, interpersonal subjectivity, but there is also Kara Ellison's intersubjectivity,

495
00:20:22,997 --> 00:20:28,220
the moment when a feeling is shared between characters, such as an out of this world,

496
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,221
when the alien sort of boops you on the nose.

497
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:39,865
I wondered what, basically my question is, what you think the Sophia sort of definition

498
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:42,007
and how it interacts with moments like that.

499
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,843
I'm not sure, not having seen the talk, it's tricky.

500
00:20:45,843 --> 00:20:51,752
So do you mean specifically emotional exchanges

501
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:53,715
that are happening between other characters,

502
00:20:53,715 --> 00:20:56,178
or between the player character, or breaking the fourth wall?

503
00:20:56,475 --> 00:21:03,422
So there was one quote from Kara where she's talking specifically about how games that have intersubjectivity

504
00:21:03,422 --> 00:21:07,105
have moments when you realize the designer thinks of you as human.

505
00:21:07,105 --> 00:21:07,886
Ah, okay.

506
00:21:07,886 --> 00:21:10,268
Yeah. Hopefully that helps. Again, I'm just trying to sort of...

507
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:18,816
It does. I mean, I think that's a very complex thing that's happening where you're having this authorial relationship.

508
00:21:18,816 --> 00:21:19,397
So, um...

509
00:21:20,982 --> 00:21:23,145
I think it's one of many moments in games

510
00:21:23,145 --> 00:21:25,367
that we seem to be having more often,

511
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,170
like with games like The Stanley Parable, where we're reflecting

512
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:31,254
back on what the game is doing itself,

513
00:21:31,254 --> 00:21:33,316
and then pulling back and breaking the fourth wall

514
00:21:33,316 --> 00:21:34,878
on that and saying, let's think about that

515
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:35,999
as a relationship between.

516
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:43,262
human beings. How Sophia interacts with that is an interesting question. I probably would have to think more about it.

517
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:51,184
But basically I think Sophia is what's going on in the game and what you're experiencing, which is going to create this kind of an immediate

518
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:55,766
affective layer, and then you're reversing that. So it's a, you could call it a narrative technique.

519
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,747
where you're saying, I'm going to trick you

520
00:21:57,747 --> 00:21:58,747
into doing these things.

521
00:21:58,747 --> 00:22:00,107
Papers, Please does this, too.

522
00:22:00,107 --> 00:22:04,529
If you get into the flow of the performance of Papers, Please,

523
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,269
you have one emotional layer.

524
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:09,230
And then you have another layer on top of that that

525
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,811
is actually running against it.

526
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:13,171
So what you have in the net is this complex interaction

527
00:22:13,171 --> 00:22:14,772
between multiple layers of emotion.

528
00:22:14,772 --> 00:22:14,812
OK.

529
00:22:14,812 --> 00:22:15,032
Thanks.

530
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:20,234
So in the description, it said that this model was

531
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:23,555
around taking stress to happiness.

532
00:22:24,152 --> 00:22:32,436
But in the presentation, it said taking fear into happiness.

533
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:34,337
So I'm not asking for my money back.

534
00:22:34,337 --> 00:22:35,758
I'm just curious.

535
00:22:35,758 --> 00:22:38,379
I'm just curious, why the distinction?

536
00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:42,201
And why did you choose fear specifically as opposed

537
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:42,802
to stress?

538
00:22:42,802 --> 00:22:45,063
Yeah, that's an interesting question.

539
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,784
I'm going to actually run back to the diagram of that.

540
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,626
Because I actually think that when we say fear,

541
00:22:50,626 --> 00:22:51,886
we mean a whole lot of things.

542
00:22:52,816 --> 00:22:57,848
And there are many layers within fear itself, anxiety and worry and frustration.

543
00:22:57,848 --> 00:23:00,594
And I think, you know, I was talking, is Mark here?

544
00:23:02,864 --> 00:23:04,545
I don't know if he's, yes, there he is.

545
00:23:04,545 --> 00:23:06,667
I was talking to Mark about this,

546
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:09,550
and he's my great cognitive science devil's advocate person,

547
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,772
and he was saying, this seems like a bad feeling.

548
00:23:11,772 --> 00:23:13,593
Why would you wanna create a bad feeling?

549
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:17,056
And I think the lowest level of fear is actually curiosity.

550
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:21,179
So I think there are many gradations

551
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:22,641
of these major emotions

552
00:23:22,641 --> 00:23:24,923
that create different subtle affects.

553
00:23:24,923 --> 00:23:27,265
And I would say that stress is probably

554
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:29,765
in that anxiety-fear space.

555
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:33,366
It just isn't as archetypal, because eventually,

556
00:23:33,366 --> 00:23:35,767
if you get all the way up to fear,

557
00:23:35,767 --> 00:23:36,747
it's something that's very clear.

558
00:23:36,747 --> 00:23:39,167
And you could argue that by the time you're creating fear,

559
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,508
you've gone too far,

560
00:23:40,508 --> 00:23:43,488
probably especially in a commercial game,

561
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,849
unless you're actually deliberately creating fear.

562
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:47,849
It's a good question, though.

563
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:50,250
Oh no, it's Nicole.

564
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,650
I think he was...

565
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,750
Yeah, go ahead.

566
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,051
Oh, sorry.

567
00:23:55,051 --> 00:23:56,457
I didn't even see you guys.

568
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,929
So a lot of these emotional loops that I've seen

569
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:04,991
have some model of feeding back into themselves.

570
00:24:04,991 --> 00:24:08,752
I'm aware that for a specific interaction in the game,

571
00:24:08,752 --> 00:24:10,853
someone could go through the entire Sophia loop

572
00:24:10,853 --> 00:24:14,375
you have on the slides right there and receive some insight.

573
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,676
But they're still playing the game.

574
00:24:15,676 --> 00:24:19,838
So could you elaborate on how it could cycle back into itself,

575
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:22,599
what the player still wants, craves,

576
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,280
after receiving some insight?

577
00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:25,109
Sure.

578
00:24:25,109 --> 00:24:26,930
That's a really good point.

579
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,872
I mean, I think I use the gear icon here deliberately

580
00:24:29,872 --> 00:24:31,813
because I think that effective games are

581
00:24:31,813 --> 00:24:33,094
these interconnected gears.

582
00:24:33,094 --> 00:24:34,875
So there are many Sophia loops that

583
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,416
are going to move between each other.

584
00:24:36,416 --> 00:24:38,518
Often in a complex interconnected game

585
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,219
that has one experience, the gears

586
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:41,519
are going to touch each other.

587
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:43,901
But in a lot of experiences, Animal Crossing is one of them.

588
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:45,522
They can be completely separate.

589
00:24:45,522 --> 00:24:47,163
You can actually do what you can do,

590
00:24:47,163 --> 00:24:49,385
nothing but fossil hunting in Animal Crossing.

591
00:24:49,385 --> 00:24:50,625
Or you could do nothing but fishing.

592
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:52,927
And it's the choice between what you do that makes

593
00:24:52,927 --> 00:24:53,948
the experience interesting.

594
00:24:54,568 --> 00:24:56,608
So there are lots and lots of these loops.

595
00:24:56,608 --> 00:24:59,089
There should be probably one arc,

596
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:00,249
which is why we look at a core loop,

597
00:25:00,249 --> 00:25:01,050
just to keep focus.

598
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,890
But that's almost more of a production tool

599
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,610
than it is design.

600
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,171
Does that make sense?

601
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,291
Yes, thank you.

602
00:25:07,291 --> 00:25:07,871
Great.

603
00:25:07,871 --> 00:25:08,291
Wonderful talk.

604
00:25:08,291 --> 00:25:10,352
I love this model.

605
00:25:10,352 --> 00:25:11,872
And I think, Fiero.

606
00:25:11,872 --> 00:25:14,273
That's super high praise.

607
00:25:14,273 --> 00:25:16,433
I really appreciate that.

608
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:17,954
Thank you.

609
00:25:17,954 --> 00:25:21,255
So Nicole Lazaro from Zio Design.

610
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:23,295
Invented Fiero, for those who are wondering.

611
00:25:23,295 --> 00:25:23,475
Yeah.

612
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:27,002
And so the relationship between emotion and action

613
00:25:27,002 --> 00:25:28,063
is really key.

614
00:25:28,063 --> 00:25:31,067
And I love what you're doing with the idea

615
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:33,470
of emotional progression, that there being

616
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,274
a core emotion to a game.

617
00:25:36,274 --> 00:25:37,175
And I was just curious.

618
00:25:37,175 --> 00:25:39,257
This opens up a lot of, it's a really great way,

619
00:25:39,257 --> 00:25:42,201
we think of things a lot at Zio in these gear type

620
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:42,922
looping fashions.

621
00:25:42,922 --> 00:25:43,463
So awesome.

622
00:25:44,003 --> 00:25:46,466
What do you think the future, I just wanted to ask you about,

623
00:25:46,466 --> 00:25:51,772
what new kinds of things could you use this model to build, do you think?

624
00:25:51,772 --> 00:25:52,512
What's the next step?

625
00:25:52,512 --> 00:25:53,974
That's an excellent question.

626
00:25:53,974 --> 00:25:55,556
Actually, can I turn it around on you?

627
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:57,878
Can I say, what do you think?

628
00:25:57,878 --> 00:26:01,122
Well, maybe you should come next year.

629
00:26:01,122 --> 00:26:02,263
We'll see you next year?

630
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:02,864
All right.

631
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:07,382
Yeah, well what I think you can do is you can, obviously you can deconstruct.

632
00:26:07,382 --> 00:26:11,664
We could simply deconstruct the genres, which you've already done.

633
00:26:11,664 --> 00:26:15,887
We've done a lot of really interesting work going into Netflix and deconstructing the emotional profiles,

634
00:26:15,887 --> 00:26:18,288
the emotion profiles of, you know, different genre.

635
00:26:18,288 --> 00:26:21,450
So comedy is made out of, you know, a couple core emotions, which is great.

636
00:26:22,111 --> 00:26:23,552
I think that just having the intent,

637
00:26:23,552 --> 00:26:26,335
creating an emotion profile, so imagine that gear,

638
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,398
you can maybe, with labeling it with various emotions,

639
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:31,901
with your motion profile, and then running that gear

640
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:33,643
kind of like a four-wheel drive or something,

641
00:26:33,643 --> 00:26:35,424
put a couple of those gears onto a little truck

642
00:26:35,424 --> 00:26:37,947
and then drive it over the terrain of your game,

643
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:41,230
and swap out those gears, you know, as a way of thing.

644
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:43,533
So I think that that would be an interesting way

645
00:26:43,533 --> 00:26:45,235
to model something in the future.

646
00:26:45,755 --> 00:26:49,681
And just in general, if we have intentional emotional outcomes

647
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:51,985
from our mechanics, I think that's going to be a really

648
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:52,605
great thing.

649
00:26:52,605 --> 00:26:54,288
So maybe I'll talk a little bit about it next year.

650
00:26:54,288 --> 00:26:55,009
I was just curious.

651
00:26:55,009 --> 00:26:56,151
That would be awesome.

652
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:57,272
I think you're right.

653
00:26:57,272 --> 00:27:00,177
I think near term, where this has been useful to me

654
00:27:00,177 --> 00:27:01,619
is where it intersects with learning.

655
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:03,580
where it intersects with analyzing games

656
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,341
and what they need, especially when you're about

657
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:06,822
midway through and you're kind of not sure

658
00:27:06,822 --> 00:27:07,402
what it's going to be.

659
00:27:07,402 --> 00:27:10,343
It's just a way of focusing yourself.

660
00:27:10,343 --> 00:27:12,024
But ultimately, from what you're saying,

661
00:27:12,024 --> 00:27:15,206
I think you can look at the application

662
00:27:15,206 --> 00:27:17,427
of the gear model itself as varying

663
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,847
depending on the core emotion,

664
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:21,689
and then leading to suggestions of new mechanics,

665
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:23,330
potentially, or even new types of emotion.

666
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,870
It's almost like a kaleidoscope,

667
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,971
like depending on which direction

668
00:27:25,971 --> 00:27:27,492
the gear is turned, I suppose.

669
00:27:27,572 --> 00:27:28,192
Exactly.

670
00:27:28,192 --> 00:27:29,913
And then if I could just add on what you're saying,

671
00:27:29,913 --> 00:27:31,854
with a loop and with a gear, the reason why it's a gear

672
00:27:31,854 --> 00:27:32,974
is it's a circle.

673
00:27:32,974 --> 00:27:34,695
And one of the ways that we find when

674
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:37,317
we consult on game projects in our client business

675
00:27:37,317 --> 00:27:40,078
is that those loops are often broken.

676
00:27:40,078 --> 00:27:42,920
So we get good curiosity to get you in,

677
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,841
some challenge to get you over the hump with the success.

678
00:27:45,841 --> 00:27:47,762
And then we get really weak feedback,

679
00:27:47,762 --> 00:27:49,743
and it doesn't feel like you've won.

680
00:27:49,743 --> 00:27:51,184
And that's important in learning games especially,

681
00:27:51,184 --> 00:27:52,945
because the winning in learning games

682
00:27:52,945 --> 00:27:54,946
is that I'm learning something.

683
00:27:54,946 --> 00:27:56,987
And so being able to close that loop.

684
00:27:57,184 --> 00:27:57,384
Cool.

685
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,328
Thank you so much.

686
00:27:59,328 --> 00:28:00,430
Great talk.

687
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:00,610
I love it.

688
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:00,811
Thank you.

689
00:28:00,811 --> 00:28:01,071
Thank you.

690
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:01,512
Thank you.

691
00:28:05,585 --> 00:28:09,568
Hi, one of the things that I have been,

692
00:28:09,568 --> 00:28:11,509
recently I've been doing a lot of stuff

693
00:28:11,509 --> 00:28:14,692
with middle schoolers and high schoolers,

694
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:19,476
and I have been noticing that this particular group

695
00:28:19,476 --> 00:28:21,958
is hypersensitive to feeling disrespected by the designer.

696
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,279
Oh yeah, so much.

697
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,160
Fairness, it's not fair.

698
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,941
And it feels like there's something,

699
00:28:25,941 --> 00:28:26,902
it's not even just fairness,

700
00:28:26,902 --> 00:28:29,163
it's like if you don't respect my ability

701
00:28:29,163 --> 00:28:32,726
to understand the nuances of this story, I'm done.

702
00:28:33,388 --> 00:28:37,926
And yet we tend to very strongly as designers...

703
00:28:39,613 --> 00:28:44,017
do that a lot. Like we feel like we have to lay out every breadcrumb for them. And I feel

704
00:28:44,017 --> 00:28:50,883
like that is very closely connected to this in some way. It's almost like they can't even

705
00:28:50,883 --> 00:28:54,766
get to the point where they're feeling the fear or the stress if they don't feel that

706
00:28:54,766 --> 00:29:01,052
respect and if they, like they start to disrespect the designer or the game and they can't take

707
00:29:01,052 --> 00:29:04,274
that first step. And then everything from there is downhill. And I'm wondering if you

708
00:29:04,274 --> 00:29:06,717
have any thoughts about that or ways to sort of

709
00:29:07,627 --> 00:29:13,949
as designers to bust through our own fear that they won't understand the more complex

710
00:29:13,949 --> 00:29:16,490
nuances of what we're trying to bring to them?

711
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,390
Yeah, absolutely.

712
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,891
I mean, I think the answer is Minecraft, right?

713
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:23,672
As the answer to all things for middle schoolers is Minecraft.

714
00:29:23,672 --> 00:29:26,673
Minecraft throws them in and shows them nothing.

715
00:29:26,673 --> 00:29:27,333
It is hard.

716
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,414
It is broken.

717
00:29:28,414 --> 00:29:31,895
It is like when we look at that from a UX standpoint, we go, what is going on in this

718
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:32,195
game?

719
00:29:32,195 --> 00:29:33,595
And yet the middle schoolers love it.

720
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:34,956
because they're deeply hungry.

721
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:37,017
I think it's about understanding the emotional state

722
00:29:37,017 --> 00:29:37,438
of your player.

723
00:29:37,438 --> 00:29:39,359
And we try and do this a lot at Glass Lab,

724
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:41,300
is really put ourselves in the state

725
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,581
where this very complex thing is going on, where kids are

726
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:45,842
becoming socially aware, overwhelmed by the world,

727
00:29:45,842 --> 00:29:47,824
but aware of it, beginning to challenge authority.

728
00:29:47,824 --> 00:29:49,285
So you build this model of your student,

729
00:29:49,285 --> 00:29:51,346
and you get it's completely predictable that that's

730
00:29:51,346 --> 00:29:52,126
how they would react.

731
00:29:52,126 --> 00:29:54,207
And yet you have the contrast of all

732
00:29:54,207 --> 00:29:57,329
of these breadcrumby, hand-holdy tutorial experiences.

733
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:00,271
And I wonder why they're bored and they don't play them.

734
00:30:00,271 --> 00:30:02,232
So I think it's partly.

735
00:30:02,292 --> 00:30:05,254
that very tricky dynamic between building for scale, which then

736
00:30:05,254 --> 00:30:07,255
means you're going for a lowest common denominator, which

737
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:08,796
means you're over the head of most of them,

738
00:30:08,796 --> 00:30:11,678
versus throwing them in by themselves.

739
00:30:11,678 --> 00:30:13,279
We are actually at, thank you so much,

740
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,520
by the way, for that question.

741
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,822
And middle schoolers are the best players.

742
00:30:17,822 --> 00:30:19,883
I think we have to go to the wrap up room,

743
00:30:19,883 --> 00:30:21,665
because we're at 12 o'clock right now.

744
00:30:21,665 --> 00:30:22,785
But I will go next door to 2002 for anybody

745
00:30:22,785 --> 00:30:24,366
who wants to continue talking.

746
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:24,727
Sorry, Link.
