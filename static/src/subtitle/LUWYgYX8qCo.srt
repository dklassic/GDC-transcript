1
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:10,410
I position myself like this, my leg forward, and...

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,092
There you go.

3
00:00:12,232 --> 00:00:13,453
And you can do it like this.

4
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:14,714
Yeah, not bad, not bad.

5
00:00:14,794 --> 00:00:15,195
Oh, hi GDC!

6
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:18,077
We're just working on our last balancing patch.

7
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:22,781
But you're here to hear a little bit more about our talk on For Honor,

8
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:25,584
learning from a successful launch to a challenging life period.

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,114
We'll go through many different parts and very different learnings, like for the life

10
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:34,579
period, in example, why we started early, why we started one year and a half before,

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,825
what we learned to do from doing different type of life periods with different objectives

12
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:41,767
and different content, and as well...

13
00:00:42,147 --> 00:00:47,675
But we will move forward to the launch, the storm of launch, and what it means to be a game as a service.

14
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:52,141
What it means in terms of reorganizing your production floor and your production process.

15
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:58,009
But also in terms of communication, moving to communicating with fans to actual customers.

16
00:00:58,854 --> 00:01:00,875
And the last part, how we moved forward.

17
00:01:00,975 --> 00:01:03,197
So we'll share with you our retention recipe

18
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:05,780
to create a player routine, but as well bring

19
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,941
some surprises to them.

20
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:08,803
And on the other side, of course,

21
00:01:08,843 --> 00:01:12,146
how we kept being sustainable so that we could

22
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:13,567
produce all of that content.

23
00:01:13,627 --> 00:01:17,250
We'll share with you our exact model regarding that.

24
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,211
So see you there.

25
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:18,671
See you there.
