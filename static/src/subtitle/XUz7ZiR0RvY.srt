00:00:05,907 --> 00:00:07,868
Hello, my name is Joshua Cook.

2
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:10,310
I'm an art director at Ubisoft Toronto.

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,331
Thank you for coming out to my talk,

4
00:00:13,572 --> 00:00:15,013
The Color of Enlightenment,

5
00:00:15,313 --> 00:00:17,975
Defining Shangri-La within Far Cry 4.

6
00:00:19,176 --> 00:00:22,197
Back in 2013, our team at Ubisoft Toronto

7
00:00:22,558 --> 00:00:24,219
was approached by Ubisoft Montreal

8
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,141
to collaborate on its upcoming Far Cry 4 project.

9
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:30,042
Our mission was to bring the mythical world

10
00:00:30,082 --> 00:00:32,624
of Shangri-La to life in a way that felt unique

11
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,605
and memorable.

12
00:00:34,142 --> 00:00:36,424
yet consistent with the world of Far Cry.

13
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:40,246
This presentation is a glimpse into our development

14
00:00:40,346 --> 00:00:41,767
of this world within a world,

15
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:45,229
and we'll focus on how our team defined Shangri-La

16
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:47,770
by creating a strict set of visual rules

17
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,312
focused primarily on color to guide us through production.

18
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:54,394
Before we get into that,

19
00:00:54,614 --> 00:00:56,095
let me tell you a little bit about myself.

20
00:00:56,715 --> 00:00:59,097
I've been working at Ubisoft nearly 10 years now,

21
00:00:59,657 --> 00:01:01,978
splitting my time equally between five years

22
00:01:02,038 --> 00:01:03,099
in the Montreal studio.

23
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,844
and five in Toronto. I started out as a 3D artist back on Rainbow Six Vegas

24
00:01:09,284 --> 00:01:12,647
I've worked on a bunch of really great titles including Assassin's Creed

25
00:01:13,227 --> 00:01:15,789
Far Cry 2, Splinter Cell Conviction

26
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:19,092
and Blacklist. My most recent project was Far Cry 4

27
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:24,936
where I was the art director for the Shangri-La content. For those of you not

28
00:01:24,996 --> 00:01:25,437
familiar

29
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:29,440
with Shangri-Las, I'd like to show you a quick video so you know what I'm talking about here.

30
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:47,962
In these uncertain times, look to our past for guidance.

31
00:01:48,982 --> 00:01:55,504
Transcend the depths of your own mind into the spiritual world of Shangri-La.

32
00:01:56,664 --> 00:02:04,586
You will fight alongside a mythical tiger and confront the evil forces that once threatened this legendary realm.

33
00:02:05,466 --> 00:02:11,348
In this world, the rules of reality don't apply, but the consequences are very real.

34
00:02:14,048 --> 00:02:17,430
What you do with this world is entirely up to you.

35
00:02:22,053 --> 00:02:23,653
Far Cry 4

36
00:02:27,435 --> 00:02:30,757
So that is Shangri-La. At least that's the version that we shipped with.

37
00:02:31,357 --> 00:02:33,899
As you can see, our world is very strange and surreal.

38
00:02:34,339 --> 00:02:37,501
And it's probably not at all what you would think about when you think about Far Cry.

39
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:41,603
When you think about Far Cry, you probably picture something more like this.

40
00:02:43,148 --> 00:02:47,411
So that's what I want to talk about today, how we created our world within this one.

41
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:49,072
I'd like to share a little story with you.

42
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:55,236
After our first big press event in Montreal, where we finally unveiled Shangri-La for the first time,

43
00:02:56,737 --> 00:03:01,280
we were traveling back to the airport in a cab with our creative director, Max Bilan.

44
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:05,763
And we were discussing how the interviews went, and of course I asked him,

45
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,644
did you get any good questions about the art?

46
00:03:08,285 --> 00:03:09,706
And he said, yeah.

47
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:12,227
They asked me how we came up with the look for our world,

48
00:03:12,487 --> 00:03:12,968
and I told them...

49
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:19,742
It was easy. We just took a screenshot of the main game into Photoshop and pressed Ctrl-I to invert and voila.

50
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:23,324
And I'm just like, you ass.

51
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:35,191
Max likes to give me a hard time, so I'm pretty sure he never actually told them that, but it was foreign press, so for all I know there could be an article out there in German or something quoting that.

52
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:40,133
The point is, he said it to me because he knew it would drive me crazy.

53
00:03:40,797 --> 00:03:43,337
because he knew how much thought we actually put into it

54
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:46,358
and how much we struggled to get to where we were at that time.

55
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:50,499
That little joke was something that stuck with me

56
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,520
and it was really the first thing that came to my mind

57
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,400
when I was approached about doing a talk.

58
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,121
I wanted to set the record straight

59
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:58,641
and talk about how we actually defined our look

60
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:01,702
and more specifically how we used color to do it.

61
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:05,843
And for anyone wondering what happens when you do invert this in Photoshop,

62
00:04:06,543 --> 00:04:06,983
there you go.

63
00:04:08,724 --> 00:04:09,304
Not so hot.

64
00:04:09,811 --> 00:04:13,092
and clearly not how we define the look of our world.

65
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:17,755
When I was first tasked with creating Shangri-La,

66
00:04:17,815 --> 00:04:21,776
I traveled to the Montreal studio to sync up with the art director for Far Cry 4,

67
00:04:22,397 --> 00:04:23,457
Jean-Alexis Doyon.

68
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:27,979
He's a very talented guy and he was also the art director for Far Cry 3 as well.

69
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:31,821
One of the main things he imparted on me for the overall look of the game was

70
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:34,002
Far Cry owns the colors.

71
00:04:34,702 --> 00:04:37,563
This is a pillar of the art direction and of the franchise.

72
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:41,336
We don't want to make a game that's another brown-gray shooter.

73
00:04:41,696 --> 00:04:42,956
We want to embrace the color.

74
00:04:43,696 --> 00:04:47,057
That philosophy, along with some of the initial inspiration pieces

75
00:04:47,817 --> 00:04:50,237
and reference images provided by the team in Montreal,

76
00:04:50,277 --> 00:04:52,638
would lay the foundations for the world we would create.

77
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:58,759
The most compelling references for us came from the holy festival of Nepal,

78
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:00,699
the festival of colors.

79
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:05,220
It's an ancient Hindu religious festival where participants color each other

80
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,320
with dry powder and water.

81
00:05:08,105 --> 00:05:10,846
And you can see the imagery is very powerful and compelling.

82
00:05:11,287 --> 00:05:14,248
The world is completely blanketed and transformed by the colors.

83
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:18,591
This really inspired us to explore a wide variety of looks

84
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:19,772
for the world of Shangri-La.

85
00:05:21,493 --> 00:05:23,994
Initially, Shangri-La was a very different place.

86
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:28,257
The main idea was we would create a miniature open world set

87
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:32,179
in the main character's mind, a strange dreamscape that

88
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,820
would be broken up and interspersed

89
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,822
with different visions and stories.

90
00:05:38,378 --> 00:05:40,659
We wanted to explore using different color schemes

91
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,980
to separate these different aspects of the world

92
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,641
from each other, dividing it up between dream,

93
00:05:45,981 --> 00:05:48,883
nightmare, and memory, each with their own unique look,

94
00:05:49,243 --> 00:05:50,563
feel, and content.

95
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:54,665
So the amazing concept artists in both Montreal and Toronto

96
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:57,886
explored tons of different looks and created a bunch

97
00:05:57,906 --> 00:05:59,947
of really inspiring concept pieces for us

98
00:06:00,347 --> 00:06:03,728
for both the environments and the characters.

99
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:06,710
Due to our tight production timeline,

100
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,881
we simultaneously went directly into production

101
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:11,481
of actual game content.

102
00:06:12,841 --> 00:06:14,462
Fleshing out the world of Shangri-La

103
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:18,043
while exploring the visual identity was very tricky

104
00:06:18,323 --> 00:06:20,564
and it's something I hope we will avoid next time.

105
00:06:21,864 --> 00:06:24,025
This was a period of a lot of back and forth

106
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:25,985
between us and the core team in Montreal.

107
00:06:26,505 --> 00:06:28,086
You get a sense of the kind of changes

108
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:29,606
we were going through from the concepts

109
00:06:30,086 --> 00:06:31,907
which were just barely ahead of production.

110
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,228
One day the section of the map would have one look,

111
00:06:35,248 --> 00:06:36,688
the next it could completely change.

112
00:06:37,677 --> 00:06:39,958
and change and change.

113
00:06:40,238 --> 00:06:43,179
Not just visually, but with the gameplay experience as well.

114
00:06:44,359 --> 00:06:46,460
The problem really came down to everyone's idea

115
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,700
of a dream world is different.

116
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:51,822
And because we were exploring the ideas

117
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:53,782
and experimenting with finding our identity

118
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:55,123
at the same time as production,

119
00:06:55,323 --> 00:06:57,784
we ended up creating a lot of extra work for ourselves,

120
00:06:58,344 --> 00:07:00,705
as well as creating conflict and uncertainty

121
00:07:01,065 --> 00:07:03,446
amongst the team and between the two studios.

122
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:06,587
The turning point for us

123
00:07:07,313 --> 00:07:13,556
came at a key time in development when we decided to refocus our efforts on creating

124
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:15,717
a tighter, more simplified experience.

125
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:22,461
We went from a wide open world telling multiple stories simultaneously to a more refined sequential

126
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:26,143
journey that would focus entirely on one ancient legend.

127
00:07:26,803 --> 00:07:31,746
The player would relive a mythical tale of a warrior's discovery of paradise and his

128
00:07:31,806 --> 00:07:33,887
encounters with the demonic invading forces.

129
00:07:36,628 --> 00:07:40,690
On the art side, we embraced this opportunity to refocus the direction.

130
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:45,873
At the time, I was collaborating with an assistant art director in Montreal by the name of Marco

131
00:07:45,893 --> 00:07:46,394
Bosheman.

132
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:52,297
Marco is an experienced art director with a strong background in teaching, and he was

133
00:07:52,457 --> 00:07:56,960
really critical in helping us to focus on creating a set of rules based on what was

134
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,681
most important.

135
00:07:58,661 --> 00:08:03,664
Rules that could easily be communicated and we could all agree upon to guide us forward

136
00:08:03,704 --> 00:08:04,525
to the end of production.

137
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:10,889
We decided to simplify what Shangri-La was to a paradise world hidden deep in the Himalayan

138
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:11,409
mountains.

139
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,994
We focused on the concept of what paradise would be to the people living in Karat, a

140
00:08:17,034 --> 00:08:21,958
contemplative world, simple and inviting like a warm, glowing fireplace.

141
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:29,465
To help achieve a sense of balance and simplicity, we reduced from the more modern, multicolored

142
00:08:29,505 --> 00:08:32,628
world of Karat to a more ancient, natural world.

143
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,245
with a simple dual tone color scheme

144
00:08:35,606 --> 00:08:37,226
made up primarily of red and gold.

145
00:08:38,027 --> 00:08:40,948
For our enemies, we wanted to maintain the same look

146
00:08:41,268 --> 00:08:42,748
and associations from Karat

147
00:08:43,028 --> 00:08:44,709
by maintaining the blue color scheme.

148
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,391
With the focus clarified, our studios agreed

149
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:52,732
on a concise set of rules for color usage

150
00:08:53,252 --> 00:08:55,933
that were then incorporated into a new design bible

151
00:08:56,293 --> 00:08:58,174
that was created to define the look

152
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:00,055
and game experience of our world.

153
00:09:00,935 --> 00:09:02,696
It was much more rigid than a style guide

154
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:07,912
and I found these rules to be a very effective way to simplify the decision making process

155
00:09:08,452 --> 00:09:09,673
and streamline our production.

156
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:14,976
I would like to share with you the ones we defined for color usage, which I feel were

157
00:09:15,016 --> 00:09:17,238
most critical and valuable to us in production.

158
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:20,280
Gold.

159
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,161
Gold was our foundation.

160
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:27,744
We chose it to bring a sense of warmth and richness and overall dream-like quality to

161
00:09:27,764 --> 00:09:28,145
the world.

162
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:38,056
We decided to use it for the sky, the terrain, and rocks, all architecture, statues, and lighting.

163
00:09:38,596 --> 00:09:44,539
This led to a couple key production decisions, including locking our time of day.

164
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:54,023
This greatly reduced the workload of our lighting artists and enabled us to tailor the environments in a way that would not have been possible otherwise.

165
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:59,025
Soft golden lighting also gave the world a very warm and welcoming feel to it.

166
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,441
also maintaining a single color scheme throughout the world,

167
00:10:04,961 --> 00:10:08,022
and now enabled us to simplify our architectural look

168
00:10:08,723 --> 00:10:11,864
to a more sculptural, carved from the rock feel

169
00:10:12,584 --> 00:10:14,505
that helped round our world

170
00:10:14,785 --> 00:10:16,485
and give it a very ancient feeling,

171
00:10:16,505 --> 00:10:18,446
a sense that everything really belonged here.

172
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:21,527
Red.

173
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:25,528
Red is the other half of the overall dual-tone look

174
00:10:25,648 --> 00:10:26,929
we established for our world.

175
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:30,070
The red is what brings the distinct look to Shangri-La.

176
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,680
and makes the world feel very strange and surreal.

177
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:37,263
It also helps create a complimentary experience to the main campaign.

178
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:40,946
We knew the question of why red was going to come up a lot,

179
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:43,768
and we wanted to have a good answer for it besides,

180
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:45,430
you know, it looks amazing.

181
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,432
So our writer, Naveed Kavari, he created this great legend

182
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:51,834
of how the goddess who created Shangri-La

183
00:10:52,215 --> 00:10:54,296
pricked her finger in a moment of frustration

184
00:10:54,716 --> 00:10:58,199
and her blood spilled out and it transformed the world.

185
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,646
I got a lot of mileage out of that one during our press tours,

186
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:04,406
and it really felt good to have a satisfying answer

187
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:06,927
and reasoning behind the logic of our world.

188
00:11:09,548 --> 00:11:11,969
We chose to use the red for all the vegetation,

189
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:15,810
the water, and of course the blood of the slaughtered animals.

190
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:19,971
A big effect this choice had on production was

191
00:11:20,352 --> 00:11:22,612
that by simplifying the look for our vegetation,

192
00:11:23,072 --> 00:11:26,113
we required much less variety than we had already planned.

193
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:29,957
Orange.

194
00:11:31,577 --> 00:11:33,157
Orange is our color of interaction.

195
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:37,878
We chose to use it because it offers just enough pop in the environment to stand out

196
00:11:38,338 --> 00:11:41,279
without being too obvious or breaking the overall look.

197
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:50,061
We used orange on our climbing ledges, our explosive pots, yes, even ancient paradise

198
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:54,662
world needs things that blow up, and also the handle of the prayer wheels, which act

199
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:58,403
as interactive switches that enable player progress throughout our world.

200
00:12:00,493 --> 00:12:03,134
During the playtest, before we added it to the handles,

201
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:06,134
I observed many players circling around the wheels,

202
00:12:06,194 --> 00:12:07,055
trying to figure them out,

203
00:12:07,735 --> 00:12:10,136
and ignoring the giant handles sticking out the side.

204
00:12:12,256 --> 00:12:14,057
But as soon as we introduced the orange powder,

205
00:12:14,377 --> 00:12:15,697
I was amazed at the difference

206
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,098
this little splash of color made.

207
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:19,018
We saw an immediate improvement

208
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:20,378
in the understanding of the players.

209
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:23,019
White.

210
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,801
White is great for creating a sense of purity and sacredness.

211
00:12:29,437 --> 00:12:32,639
so it was a natural choice to use it to define our sacred elements.

212
00:12:34,341 --> 00:12:36,703
The white acts as an accent color throughout the world

213
00:12:37,143 --> 00:12:39,845
to highlight these sacred elements and create visual interest.

214
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,367
The white is used for the prayer flags,

215
00:12:42,948 --> 00:12:43,828
the prayer candles,

216
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,571
all the animals, and the protector,

217
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,693
the white tiger companion who fights along your side.

218
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:55,398
The decision to go with all white animals was not just an artistic choice,

219
00:12:55,438 --> 00:12:57,360
but it also tied into the game design as well.

220
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,912
Originally, we had planned to have predator animals in the world,

221
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:05,194
but as we embraced the idea that the player was meant to be a protector of this world,

222
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:08,335
running around and slaughtering animals just didn't feel right.

223
00:13:09,115 --> 00:13:11,356
It was supposed to be something only the demons would do.

224
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:17,979
So we removed the predator animals and made all our creatures passive and white

225
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:20,981
to give them a sense of innocence and purity.

226
00:13:21,661 --> 00:13:25,262
This choice drastically reduced the overall workload of the character,

227
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:27,303
design, and programming teams.

228
00:13:29,947 --> 00:13:35,891
The white fur also really enhanced the contrast of the blood and brutality of the slaughtered

229
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:37,292
animals found throughout our world.

230
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:40,895
Blue.

231
00:13:42,616 --> 00:13:44,678
Blue is the color of evil in Shangri-La.

232
00:13:45,598 --> 00:13:50,001
We needed to use a color that would really stand out and feel very foreign in a world

233
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:50,742
of red and gold.

234
00:13:53,204 --> 00:13:57,087
The decision to use blue on our enemies originated from the enemies of the main game.

235
00:13:57,484 --> 00:14:00,525
who were themselves inspired by the Nepalese police force.

236
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:04,766
We really wanted to play off the players' established associations

237
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:07,906
from the world of Karate of blue equals enemies.

238
00:14:08,466 --> 00:14:10,927
And because it is so out of place in the world we created,

239
00:14:11,507 --> 00:14:13,428
the blue really helped to make the enemies stand out

240
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:15,988
and feel that they do not belong in this place.

241
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:20,129
In the last missions of Shangri-La,

242
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:23,430
as the player draws closer to the final confrontation,

243
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:29,892
We chose to coat the whole world in a blue light to really emphasize the enemy's presence and effect on the world.

244
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:38,659
Note that even though we tinted the world blue, we still managed to preserve the reds in the vegetation through color correction.

245
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:44,484
This ensured that we would maintain the signature Shangri-La look that we were trying to create.

246
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:52,251
Another color-related aspect I'd like to touch on quickly, as I feel it's pretty important,

247
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,360
is our use of color transitions.

248
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:58,303
We chose to use the color transitions boldly and abruptly

249
00:14:58,984 --> 00:15:01,006
to accentuate a couple key events.

250
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:04,869
The first one is the opening visit

251
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:07,491
of your first time in Shangri-La.

252
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:09,332
I actually had to fight really hard

253
00:15:09,432 --> 00:15:10,253
to make this one happen

254
00:15:10,313 --> 00:15:12,214
as a lot of people felt it was unnecessary.

255
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:14,576
But for me, sometimes you gotta fight for things.

256
00:15:15,277 --> 00:15:17,739
Because we wouldn't know what the player was doing

257
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:20,541
or where they were coming from when they entered the world,

258
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:26,154
I felt it was critical that we create an opening sequence that would really accentuate the transition.

259
00:15:27,114 --> 00:15:30,495
This was really inspired for me by the movie The Wizard of Oz.

260
00:15:32,855 --> 00:15:36,956
The world of Oz is even more vibrant and shocking when you first encounter it

261
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:40,477
because of its contrast with the black and white intro,

262
00:15:40,717 --> 00:15:42,557
and I wanted to craft a similar experience.

263
00:15:44,097 --> 00:15:46,738
So instead of dropping the player directly into our world,

264
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:48,978
we send them back just a little bit further in the story.

265
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:52,870
to the moment just before Kalanag leaves the snowy mountaintops

266
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,410
and enters our world through an underwater passage.

267
00:15:57,031 --> 00:16:01,131
This allowed us complete control and it really enhanced our introduction.

268
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,092
This transition from an almost colorless world

269
00:16:04,552 --> 00:16:07,713
into a vibrant shores of Shangri-La is very powerful

270
00:16:07,993 --> 00:16:09,513
and in the end it was totally worth it.

271
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:14,814
The other key transition is at the very end of Shangri-La

272
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:17,295
as the player defeats the giant Rakshasa.

273
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,871
and the presence of evil is visibly lifted from the world

274
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:24,812
and it is restored back to its full vibrant glory.

275
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,872
This wrapped up the experience nicely

276
00:16:27,313 --> 00:16:29,773
and really helped to emphasize that the player's actions

277
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:31,193
had actually affected the world.

278
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:35,314
With our choices established

279
00:16:35,394 --> 00:16:36,995
and the color rules firmly in place

280
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:39,916
to maintain a consistent look throughout our world,

281
00:16:40,316 --> 00:16:42,676
the artists were then freed to create beautiful

282
00:16:42,796 --> 00:16:45,357
and compelling spaces without the worries

283
00:16:45,497 --> 00:16:46,637
of uncertainty or change.

284
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:53,790
We were also able to be very confident that we'd be delivering content to the core team

285
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:59,036
that would not contain any unwanted surprises or conflict with the overall vision for the

286
00:16:59,076 --> 00:16:59,356
world.

287
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,061
One more video.

288
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:23,501
Where we were, kinda think, bet you pause, all alone

289
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:29,644
Where we were, kinda think, bet you pause, all alone

290
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:58,762
Port winners, I burn autumn

291
00:17:58,782 --> 00:18:00,523
Guts niggas so Kirk-mama

292
00:18:00,643 --> 00:18:02,524
Ill-bombed, got a crush on her

293
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:03,805
I gotta wait in line for that

294
00:18:04,085 --> 00:18:05,586
Ain't nobody got time for that

295
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,827
Ain't nobody got a rhyme for that

296
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:09,508
Too true like it's too changed

297
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:10,609
Blue blood, lucky both gangs

298
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:15,091
When we were, kinda thick

299
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:18,473
Bet you'd fall, all alone

300
00:18:40,923 --> 00:18:44,446
When that video came out, I was super proud.

301
00:18:44,846 --> 00:18:47,208
To me, this was all the confirmation that I needed

302
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,149
that we had achieved all our goals.

303
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,711
We created a world that fit perfectly

304
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:52,772
with the world of Karat

305
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:55,454
and enhanced the overall Far Cry experience.

306
00:18:56,415 --> 00:18:58,537
If there's one thing I'd like you to take away from this,

307
00:18:59,137 --> 00:19:01,739
besides the fact that Ubisoft has amazing artists,

308
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,661
it's that color is a very powerful tool.

309
00:19:05,522 --> 00:19:08,044
Not just for making things look great and interesting,

310
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:10,406
but also for helping to define your worlds.

311
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:18,433
This approach won't necessarily work for everything, but for us, defining a distinct set of rules for color usage,

312
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:24,976
our team simplified the production process, reduced arguments, and made all our choices easier.

313
00:19:26,057 --> 00:19:31,459
All while creating a unique and memorable experience that defines Shangri-La within Far Cry 4.

314
00:19:34,601 --> 00:19:34,901
Thank you.

315
00:19:43,978 --> 00:19:47,987
If you have any questions or you'd like to chat about anything, please come see me in

316
00:19:48,027 --> 00:19:53,018
the wrap-up room or find me this afternoon at 12.30 in the Ubisoft Lounge, West Hall,

317
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:53,599
third floor.

318
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,701
Thank you again.
