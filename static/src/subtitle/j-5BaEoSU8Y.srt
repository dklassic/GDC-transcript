1
00:00:03,953 --> 00:00:05,415
Let's start off this talk.

2
00:00:05,435 --> 00:00:07,276
My name is Casey, and this talk is called

3
00:00:07,296 --> 00:00:09,858
Slate Aspire, Success Through Marketability.

4
00:00:10,158 --> 00:00:12,721
And this is a presentation about our journey

5
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:14,682
and how our team found and kept up

6
00:00:14,722 --> 00:00:16,664
the success for Slate Aspire.

7
00:00:18,765 --> 00:00:20,867
This talk is kind of like a post-mortem

8
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:23,229
and also a general information kind of thing

9
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:25,571
for how we approached our three year development cycle.

10
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:27,753
I don't think it's too technical,

11
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:31,276
and so it should be easy to understand for everybody.

12
00:00:32,647 --> 00:00:35,409
If the practices that I describe in this talk

13
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:37,450
don't apply to your game, I hope that at least

14
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,992
you'll get a good insight into how and why

15
00:00:41,033 --> 00:00:42,654
games like Slay the Spire work out.

16
00:00:42,674 --> 00:00:45,275
All right.

17
00:00:47,597 --> 00:00:47,957
Did I go?

18
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:50,159
Next.

19
00:00:52,461 --> 00:00:53,561
Next, okay.

20
00:00:54,882 --> 00:00:56,003
So first a little bit about myself.

21
00:00:56,503 --> 00:00:58,565
My name is Casey Yano, and I worked with

22
00:00:58,885 --> 00:01:00,786
Anthony Giovannetti, and the two of us

23
00:01:00,866 --> 00:01:01,807
formed MegaCrate Games.

24
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:05,881
We made one game through MegaCrate Games,

25
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:06,821
and that's Slay the Spire.

26
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:09,083
There's our developer email address

27
00:01:09,464 --> 00:01:12,026
if you want to contact us for whatever reasons,

28
00:01:12,086 --> 00:01:14,868
you know, inquiries, if you want any advice,

29
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:16,810
or you want to grab a cup of coffee.

30
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:20,393
A little bit of background about us in general

31
00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:22,795
is that back in our early college days,

32
00:01:22,815 --> 00:01:25,277
Anthony and I were inspired by the success

33
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:28,640
of a few very small game development studios.

34
00:01:29,706 --> 00:01:33,727
There were games like Cave Story, Aquaria, Untitled Story,

35
00:01:33,747 --> 00:01:35,807
and there were a bunch of other Flash games

36
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:38,248
that were generally made by solo developers.

37
00:01:39,288 --> 00:01:41,289
So we were inspired to make our own video game,

38
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:43,469
and we formed a company called Pew Pew Inc.,

39
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,450
and we released two games over the course of a few months.

40
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,571
I think it was one summer,

41
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:51,931
maybe like sophomore year of college,

42
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:54,972
and these games didn't do very well.

43
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:58,035
So we took a break from making video games for a bit.

44
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:01,537
We kind of finished up college, and then we kind of went our

45
00:02:01,577 --> 00:02:04,138
separate ways and found jobs in the software industry.

46
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:08,721
Out of college, I worked as a Q engineer at a place called

47
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,102
Amazon.com, that some of you may have heard of.

48
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:15,444
And I worked there for, I wrote four years on my slides.

49
00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:16,525
It was actually five years.

50
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:19,166
I was a contractor for one year, and I was full-time for

51
00:02:19,206 --> 00:02:19,586
four years.

52
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:22,088
And Anthony, who went a separate way.

53
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:24,968
also worked as a QA, but at a different company.

54
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:26,349
And we never really talked about it,

55
00:02:26,809 --> 00:02:28,329
but it's very interesting that we both kind of

56
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:29,810
ended up doing the same thing.

57
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,531
While working at Amazon, I tinkered on and off

58
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:36,252
with some more game development on the side.

59
00:02:36,972 --> 00:02:38,593
I guess I always wanted to make video games,

60
00:02:39,713 --> 00:02:42,074
but at the time at Amazon, there was a kind of

61
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:43,554
restrictive game development policy.

62
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,876
And the company had this kind of gray area,

63
00:02:46,996 --> 00:02:48,856
and a lot of the developers that wanted to make games there,

64
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,941
as like a hobby, we're kind of demoralized,

65
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:52,801
and it was kind of strange.

66
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:57,042
And so a few years of this, of like tinkering with games,

67
00:02:57,062 --> 00:02:58,523
but not really know if I can publish it.

68
00:02:59,803 --> 00:03:01,484
Kind of grew tired and bored of my job,

69
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,984
so I just kind of quit, and then I reconnected with Anthony.

70
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:05,405
I was like, Anthony, what are you up to?

71
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:07,705
And he was like, I work at this company,

72
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:08,966
and I want to make video games,

73
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:10,566
but I'm working now, so I can't.

74
00:03:11,246 --> 00:03:13,947
And so I'm like, okay, well, I quit my job.

75
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:15,588
And he was like, why?

76
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:18,885
And I said, well I want to make video games,

77
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:20,286
what do you think, we're crazy people.

78
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:23,548
So, you know, and we started working on our third game,

79
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:24,108
Slay This Fire.

80
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:28,211
The picture you see up on these slides, over here.

81
00:03:28,231 --> 00:03:31,193
Oh, now I'm on the same slide, okay.

82
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:34,816
This is from our Flash game, our first Flash game.

83
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:38,018
I think it was like, our resolution was like 600 by 600.

84
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:41,821
That's our logo, and then screenshot of the game.

85
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:44,482
It was a Flash game shoot-em-up called God Laser.

86
00:03:44,503 --> 00:03:45,583
It was really cool.

87
00:03:45,903 --> 00:03:46,424
It got maybe.

88
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:51,732
10,000 views or plays or whatever metrics Flash games used back then.

89
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:56,316
And that was on like Congregate and a few other Flash game portals.

90
00:03:57,136 --> 00:04:04,563
We also made a 99 cent iOS game that got about 200 downloads.

91
00:04:05,383 --> 00:04:06,564
And that was on the Apple Store.

92
00:04:08,846 --> 00:04:10,888
We also started working on a third game. It was a rhythm game.

93
00:04:11,548 --> 00:04:13,850
Except that was never completed because...

94
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:16,494
I think it didn't work out with their musician

95
00:04:16,694 --> 00:04:17,775
or the performance wasn't good.

96
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:19,576
There's all sorts of small reasons.

97
00:04:20,696 --> 00:04:22,557
While it is interesting to talk about these older projects,

98
00:04:23,578 --> 00:04:25,038
I think the gaming landscape has changed

99
00:04:25,118 --> 00:04:25,899
quite a bit since then.

100
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,941
And so this talk will mostly just focus on Slate Aspire.

101
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:32,422
Okay, so what's Slate Aspire?

102
00:04:33,422 --> 00:04:35,423
It's actually quite difficult to explain

103
00:04:36,084 --> 00:04:37,184
what Slate Aspire is.

104
00:04:38,064 --> 00:04:40,586
And this is kind of gonna be like a recurring theme

105
00:04:40,606 --> 00:04:41,086
for this talk.

106
00:04:41,814 --> 00:04:44,536
Just so you can experience it, our elevator pitch

107
00:04:44,976 --> 00:04:47,438
slash short description on our Steam store page

108
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:48,538
kinda goes like this.

109
00:04:48,558 --> 00:04:51,460
It says, we fused card games and roguelikes together

110
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,802
to make the best single-player deck builder we could.

111
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:56,523
Craft a unique deck, encounter bizarre creatures,

112
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,165
discover relics of immense power, and slay this fire.

113
00:05:01,847 --> 00:05:02,627
Anyone know what the game is?

114
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:04,268
I mean, I guess if you come to this talk,

115
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:04,928
you know what the game is.

116
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:10,154
But there's actually a lot of complex mechanics and words

117
00:05:10,174 --> 00:05:12,736
that if you're not used to them, you wouldn't understand.

118
00:05:12,756 --> 00:05:15,219
And right, it's like, what's a rogue like?

119
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,341
Why are you fusing them with card games?

120
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:18,963
And what's a deck builder?

121
00:05:19,163 --> 00:05:20,805
And why is a card game single player?

122
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,266
There was a bunch of questions like this.

123
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:25,870
And I think that was going to be a start

124
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,071
of a few problems in the beginning.

125
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:29,073
However.

126
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:32,724
Our game was released on Steam Early Access on November 14, 2017,

127
00:05:34,185 --> 00:05:35,946
and then we reached full release just two years ago.

128
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:41,707
So we finished the game, and to date we've sold over 1.5 million copies,

129
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:48,050
and so it's been about 7,500 times more popular than our iOS game, which is good.

130
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,001
So this is a screenshot of a game

131
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:55,702
at a user score of 99%, which is incredible.

132
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:58,944
And it's something that's like, to me as a developer,

133
00:05:58,964 --> 00:05:59,884
it's something I'm very proud of.

134
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:02,585
I think even if a game doesn't sell well,

135
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:06,427
a good user score alludes that the developer's

136
00:06:06,487 --> 00:06:09,028
very conscious of what their player base wants and needs.

137
00:06:09,888 --> 00:06:12,069
And I think that's something we should all strive for.

138
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:15,031
I think this philosophy on game development

139
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:18,272
differs from most studios.

140
00:06:19,092 --> 00:06:19,933
Negative user reviews.

141
00:06:21,342 --> 00:06:25,065
you know, are things that happen because players feel that

142
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:26,686
they can't talk to the developers,

143
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,887
or they can't reach the developers,

144
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:29,989
and so it's kind of a way to like,

145
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:32,350
email the developers and complain,

146
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:34,772
because if they feel like they're not responding,

147
00:06:35,032 --> 00:06:36,233
then that's the only way they can get to them.

148
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:39,135
As someone who always reads reviews

149
00:06:39,656 --> 00:06:41,257
before making any and all purchases,

150
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:44,139
whether it's like Steam or Amazon.com,

151
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:50,347
I felt that making games or any product successful in the long run should have a heavy emphasis

152
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:54,250
on customer feedback loops and maintaining proper expectations.

153
00:06:55,991 --> 00:07:01,095
At Amazon there's a principle called customer obsession and while I don't agree with everything

154
00:07:01,115 --> 00:07:07,881
that Amazon did, it is the only company I ever worked for and so I suppose some of these

155
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:10,803
principles have been kind of like nailed into my psyche.

156
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:16,510
All right, so back in 2015,

157
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:19,772
around the time I started working on A Sight of Spire,

158
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:22,154
I decided to approach game development

159
00:07:22,254 --> 00:07:24,595
a lot more seriously and with more discipline

160
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:27,818
than our previous games because, you know, they failed.

161
00:07:28,618 --> 00:07:31,240
So I read up a lot of articles every single day,

162
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,222
and this was while I was working on the game,

163
00:07:34,422 --> 00:07:35,422
and just have a good baseline

164
00:07:35,442 --> 00:07:36,923
and understanding of game development,

165
00:07:37,104 --> 00:07:38,705
what's going on in the game development world,

166
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:41,406
and just get as much perspectives as possible.

167
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:46,808
Many articles during this time that got the spotlight was about marketing.

168
00:07:46,828 --> 00:07:53,430
So like a basic definition, it's like marketing refers to the activities of a company associated

169
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,991
with buying and selling a product or service.

170
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:58,491
It includes advertising, selling and delivering products to people.

171
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:04,573
And why I crossed out the selling and delivering portion was because Anthony and I initially

172
00:08:04,613 --> 00:08:05,133
thought, well...

173
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:09,910
We'll sell the game on Steam and then we'll deliver the game over the internet.

174
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:16,173
So, in the context of this definition, I think that marketing was about advertising your

175
00:08:16,193 --> 00:08:16,353
game.

176
00:08:16,753 --> 00:08:21,515
Getting the game known, heard, making the game look appealing so that players will

177
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:22,616
eventually buy the game.

178
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,981
For those of you who are trying to sell your game

179
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:28,462
outside of Steam, such as your own website

180
00:08:28,662 --> 00:08:29,822
or the new stores that are coming up,

181
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:31,463
I think it's possible.

182
00:08:31,703 --> 00:08:32,904
I'm not quite sure how that works,

183
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:34,164
but good luck.

184
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:35,585
You know, like Minecraft did it,

185
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:38,166
and Escape from Tarkov is also succeeding.

186
00:08:39,027 --> 00:08:41,208
So, but I don't have too much advice on that.

187
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:46,570
All right, just for some visual examples,

188
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:48,131
here's an image of.

189
00:08:48,398 --> 00:08:49,499
I was going to say here's an image.

190
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:51,481
I don't know where the slides are going to be.

191
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:54,783
But I put some random images of what I consider

192
00:08:54,843 --> 00:08:55,583
traditional marketing.

193
00:08:57,465 --> 00:09:01,768
In the top right, no, that's wrong.

194
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:04,930
In the left side, there's an image of a press release

195
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,712
by Apple, which is like sending an email or having a.

196
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:11,718
web page that says, look, we're releasing this new and exciting product.

197
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:15,661
Guerrilla marketing is of course like when you have like something unusual and people go,

198
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:19,864
ha, the people who did this unusual thing also have this other product

199
00:09:20,424 --> 00:09:23,827
which is not really related but I should look into it. I don't really know how it works.

200
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:27,629
Look at this giant coffee cup. Oh, those McDonald's guys.

201
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,111
I sure do want a Big Mac now.

202
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,941
and the Twitter logo.

203
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:35,744
I put that out because Twitter and Instagram

204
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:36,564
is like a great place.

205
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:38,826
We post pictures and GIFs.

206
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:40,227
Is it GIFs?

207
00:09:41,008 --> 00:09:41,589
GIFs or GIFs?

208
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:42,990
GIFs is peanut butter.

209
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,692
GIFs is probably correct.

210
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,515
And they put hashtags so people can share your cool pictures

211
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:49,656
and hype up the game for you.

212
00:09:51,697 --> 00:09:52,038
It's great.

213
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:56,101
And then Facebook ads is like, I just put it there.

214
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:58,283
I don't really know how ads work since I have AdBlock.

215
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:02,904
But advertisements have been around,

216
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:04,064
and they're not going to go away.

217
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:07,226
And so there are other types of ads outside of Facebook, too.

218
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:10,128
Physical ads, sponsorships, things of that sort.

219
00:10:10,228 --> 00:10:12,550
So some other examples of traditional advertising,

220
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,871
of course, are things like, there

221
00:10:14,891 --> 00:10:17,052
are some unintentional advertisements, I feel like.

222
00:10:17,473 --> 00:10:20,354
Like developer blogs, which highlight

223
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:22,716
interesting things about your game or its development

224
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:23,216
process.

225
00:10:25,297 --> 00:10:26,638
I'm not sure if somebody would write.

226
00:10:27,524 --> 00:10:29,586
a dev diary or a dev blog for themselves.

227
00:10:29,766 --> 00:10:31,947
Sometimes you do, for like an archival purpose,

228
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:34,709
but I think a lot of them have an intention

229
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:36,711
to be like, this is what we're working on,

230
00:10:36,731 --> 00:10:38,572
this is why it's hard, this is why the game

231
00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:39,373
is gonna be interesting.

232
00:10:39,553 --> 00:10:41,094
And I do think that they are interesting,

233
00:10:41,714 --> 00:10:46,058
and they are a form of selling the game, for sure.

234
00:10:46,198 --> 00:10:47,619
And lastly, of course, is like game trailers

235
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:49,880
and screenshots, making those look nice

236
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:51,782
is definitely a form of like marketing

237
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,803
that you're trying to help out your game, of course, right?

238
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:55,184
You want people to know what your game is,

239
00:10:55,845 --> 00:10:56,545
so that they'll buy the game.

240
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:01,448
Okay, so we started working on the Slay the Spire prototype

241
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:02,549
in August 2015.

242
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,391
It was in development for a little over two years

243
00:11:06,431 --> 00:11:07,612
before early access launch.

244
00:11:07,692 --> 00:11:09,673
So it's actually really quite a long time.

245
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:15,817
Just some advice, if you think that you want to release

246
00:11:15,877 --> 00:11:18,699
a game that will take about one year, it will take two.

247
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,241
My handy equation is, how long do you think it will take?

248
00:11:23,462 --> 00:11:24,483
Multiply that by two.

249
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:26,044
All right.

250
00:11:27,492 --> 00:11:29,853
So while we created the prototype and iterated on the design,

251
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:32,915
and fleshed out visuals, we hired a few contractors.

252
00:11:33,195 --> 00:11:34,736
So although it's a team of two people,

253
00:11:35,156 --> 00:11:36,937
we definitely got help from a few other people.

254
00:11:37,638 --> 00:11:40,559
These are people like artists and illustrators

255
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,161
who created our professional looking backgrounds,

256
00:11:43,421 --> 00:11:46,763
made illustrations for, we have events in our game,

257
00:11:46,863 --> 00:11:48,244
and those all have still images.

258
00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:49,765
Those are contracted out.

259
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:51,746
We also worked with a very talented composer.

260
00:11:52,646 --> 00:11:59,614
named Clark from Australia and he also worked with us to help us get some voice actors. There is some voice acting in the game

261
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:01,856
They're very like

262
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:05,500
Thank

263
00:12:06,749 --> 00:12:08,930
A good request we had for one of the voice actors was,

264
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,771
there's a character called the Cultist,

265
00:12:10,951 --> 00:12:14,472
who's wearing a mask and they worship crows,

266
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:16,193
and we told the voice actor to say,

267
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:18,314
Kaka, like, Kaka, like that.

268
00:12:18,754 --> 00:12:22,456
And I'm like, you have to sound like a man in a crow suit.

269
00:12:23,136 --> 00:12:23,916
And those are the notes.

270
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:28,478
And he did it a few times, because we weren't satisfied.

271
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,080
Just imagining somebody in a studio

272
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,300
saying Kaka over and over again.

273
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,141
So that must have been very exciting.

274
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,280
So yeah, so once our game felt presentable,

275
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:40,263
we wanted to promote our game for a few months

276
00:12:40,323 --> 00:12:43,566
before we released into early access.

277
00:12:44,327 --> 00:12:46,609
We worked on a trailer which was released around April 2017.

278
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,332
So this was about a year and a half in.

279
00:12:49,872 --> 00:12:51,894
We set up a website, we used Press Kit.

280
00:12:53,987 --> 00:12:55,607
I think that's a known thing, right?

281
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:56,448
It's called PressKit.

282
00:12:57,168 --> 00:12:59,770
It's gonna say like tm PressKit parentheses.

283
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,251
And we were participating in things like

284
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:05,053
Screenshot Saturdays, on sites like Reddit,

285
00:13:05,373 --> 00:13:07,374
and like Twitter, and like hashtags, and things like that.

286
00:13:07,794 --> 00:13:10,235
We tried to post interesting GIFs.

287
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:13,817
And this was between February and April 2017.

288
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,339
So results from that,

289
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,781
our website didn't really get any visitors.

290
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,183
and we had an email subscription,

291
00:13:22,524 --> 00:13:24,224
like a sign up for a newsletter,

292
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:26,245
and we didn't really get too many people on that.

293
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:30,006
I think we got some family and friends.

294
00:13:31,907 --> 00:13:33,548
And our social media posts had maybe

295
00:13:33,568 --> 00:13:35,809
about 100 to 1,000 impressions.

296
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:37,569
I think 1,000 was really good for us,

297
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:38,670
about 1,000 people.

298
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,691
So the silent development was really very exciting.

299
00:13:42,951 --> 00:13:44,532
So that's our character, the silent.

300
00:13:44,932 --> 00:13:48,173
Just gonna make a pun, but nevermind.

301
00:13:52,566 --> 00:13:54,567
All right, so while we were posting these things,

302
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:56,407
our game didn't really stand out from the crowd

303
00:13:56,907 --> 00:13:58,328
during this pre-release promotion phase.

304
00:13:59,768 --> 00:14:02,769
I tried making interesting progress screenshots and GIFs,

305
00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:05,330
but we couldn't compete against the other visually

306
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,091
fantastic games like Manifold Garden,

307
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:12,572
or games like Inside and Cuphead, Ori and the Blind Forest,

308
00:14:12,872 --> 00:14:14,032
and much, much more.

309
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:15,293
Games are beautiful now.

310
00:14:15,393 --> 00:14:16,853
Everyone's really talented.

311
00:14:19,354 --> 00:14:21,775
So the gaming landscape felt extremely competitive.

312
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,260
at this time, and these masterful visuals

313
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,782
that we couldn't touch were very much a problem

314
00:14:29,822 --> 00:14:30,582
for people like us.

315
00:14:31,623 --> 00:14:35,024
A lot of technologies and articles about technologies

316
00:14:35,064 --> 00:14:38,786
were mostly about VR or the ever-growing mobile market,

317
00:14:38,986 --> 00:14:41,267
and we weren't in the mobile market ordering VR.

318
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:43,027
Things like eSports were happening,

319
00:14:43,227 --> 00:14:44,548
competitive games were getting much larger,

320
00:14:44,568 --> 00:14:45,528
and they're still getting larger.

321
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:47,869
Battle Royale was becoming a thing,

322
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:50,430
so we weren't really on any of these trends.

323
00:14:53,824 --> 00:14:56,705
So not only was our game not really visually fantastic,

324
00:14:57,205 --> 00:14:59,246
but it was also not too exciting on paper either.

325
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,667
I mentioned the elevator pitch earlier,

326
00:15:02,988 --> 00:15:05,449
but we were making a game full of unusual core mechanics.

327
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:07,490
What's a roguelike, what's a deck builder, right?

328
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:11,332
Compound this with the fact that we have no reputation

329
00:15:11,372 --> 00:15:14,973
as game developers besides these failure games from the past.

330
00:15:16,102 --> 00:15:18,904
and so much more new game developers were entering the space.

331
00:15:19,624 --> 00:15:21,705
Engines like Unity were lowering the barrier to entry

332
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:23,265
for developers, and this is great,

333
00:15:24,426 --> 00:15:26,007
but that meant we were also all competing

334
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:27,507
for the front page, right?

335
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:29,848
We didn't give up too easily,

336
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,969
because there was one thing we did confirm

337
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:33,330
over and over throughout our development,

338
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,351
and that was that the game is fun.

339
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:39,898
So how do we reach this conclusion that the game was fun?

340
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:42,779
One, we had our gut instinct.

341
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:46,261
We were like, this game's fun, because we played it,

342
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:48,422
and it's fun, and we got all the things that we wanted.

343
00:15:49,502 --> 00:15:52,224
Two, all of our friends, which we invited

344
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,604
into our secret playtesting group,

345
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:54,845
were having a great time.

346
00:15:56,126 --> 00:15:57,406
They were having a really great time.

347
00:15:58,107 --> 00:15:59,067
Like, they were having problems.

348
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:03,509
And so, friends can be too polite,

349
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,031
and sometimes they may or may not tell you

350
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:07,031
if a game is actually good.

351
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,360
or bad, or not fun.

352
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,022
So you also have to showcase your game to strangers.

353
00:16:12,322 --> 00:16:13,603
So we took our game outside.

354
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:16,285
And so after a year or so of development,

355
00:16:16,305 --> 00:16:17,246
it was ready to go outside.

356
00:16:18,487 --> 00:16:21,409
We took it to several events, expos and festivals.

357
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,132
These were all in Seattle, because that's where we're located.

358
00:16:24,812 --> 00:16:26,374
There's a nice group of folks that run something

359
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:27,414
called the Seattle Indies.

360
00:16:28,275 --> 00:16:29,516
And yeah, woo!

361
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:30,877
Anyone want to come?

362
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:32,839
And when Seattle Indies events, they're really,

363
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:34,861
they're like, oh yeah, here we go, woo!

364
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:35,941
Oh, shit.

365
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:43,494
Okay, so during year one and between,

366
00:16:44,415 --> 00:16:45,776
after year one of development

367
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:47,277
and until we released early access,

368
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:49,958
we probably took our game to around 10 in-person events.

369
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:54,240
This is a picture, which side is it?

370
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:58,843
This is a picture of our monitor and laptop style booth

371
00:16:58,863 --> 00:16:59,783
that we exhibit at these events.

372
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:04,126
People who sat down at these booths were in trouble.

373
00:17:05,927 --> 00:17:07,227
So, oh, did I go to the next page?

374
00:17:07,468 --> 00:17:07,668
Sorry.

375
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:10,416
Some people came back to play the demo.

376
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:12,577
We had a demo, you just play the first level.

377
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:15,299
And it took about 30 minutes.

378
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,040
And we had some people come back over and over again

379
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,101
to play the first level, over and over.

380
00:17:20,342 --> 00:17:22,443
So we were like, I think we've got something here.

381
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:26,390
And while we didn't get any noticeable press

382
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,491
from these events or anybody talking about us,

383
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:30,272
we did make a lot of connections.

384
00:17:30,452 --> 00:17:31,653
We talked to a lot of people.

385
00:17:32,113 --> 00:17:34,855
We got a feel for what kind of processes and practices

386
00:17:34,915 --> 00:17:36,116
were good for game development.

387
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:38,257
And also, just having people play the game

388
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:40,098
was useful for all sorts of reasons,

389
00:17:40,138 --> 00:17:42,740
like streamlining the interface, finding issues,

390
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,561
and things of that sort.

391
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:45,302
It was also really motivating just

392
00:17:45,322 --> 00:17:48,063
to have people play your game and enjoy it.

393
00:17:48,384 --> 00:17:49,705
That's a good motivator, too.

394
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:53,611
work on a game, especially if you're in a development phase

395
00:17:54,352 --> 00:17:55,513
where you're not getting much feedback.

396
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:58,435
It gets pretty tough to work on a game alone, I think.

397
00:17:58,675 --> 00:17:59,356
Well, just two of us.

398
00:18:00,637 --> 00:18:01,278
Two of us alone.

399
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,142
So even with Total Strangers having fun with their game,

400
00:18:06,582 --> 00:18:08,084
we were having difficulty getting traction

401
00:18:08,384 --> 00:18:10,186
on the internet, which is where we were planning

402
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:11,447
to sell the game, on the internet.

403
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,149
So before we released the game in early access,

404
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:16,711
we created and published three separate videos.

405
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,613
The first video is the trailer I talked about earlier.

406
00:18:22,773 --> 00:18:23,794
This was the teaser trailer.

407
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:27,076
We made another trailer just for Early Access launch,

408
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:30,098
and this was called our Early Access launch trailer.

409
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:32,240
And when we released the game, we also

410
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,081
decided to create a supplementary video

411
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,342
in an attempt to explain the game's mechanics

412
00:18:37,063 --> 00:18:39,304
and why we thought it would be fun.

413
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,866
This is a 15-minute explanation video

414
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:44,027
of Anthony playing the game and explaining

415
00:18:44,047 --> 00:18:44,808
the game's mechanics.

416
00:18:45,368 --> 00:18:47,209
It currently, to this day, has 982 views.

417
00:18:50,983 --> 00:18:56,525
This is kind of to be expected as we're not streamers with exciting personalities or following.

418
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:58,725
But you know, miracles could happen.

419
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:06,627
And the first two videos, the trailers, the early access trailer and the teaser trailer

420
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:09,968
were created by two separate professional video game trailer makers.

421
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:15,989
Trailers are still a necessary asset for store pages, but they weren't really helping us

422
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:16,549
out too much.

423
00:19:17,632 --> 00:19:19,774
And so the view counts on these videos when they came out

424
00:19:19,794 --> 00:19:20,615
were very, very low.

425
00:19:20,635 --> 00:19:23,097
It was very disheartening, and we were starting to worry.

426
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:24,878
Maybe there's no game.

427
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,381
Maybe there's no audience for a game like Slay the Spire.

428
00:19:30,543 --> 00:19:31,684
On top of all this, we were quickly

429
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,906
approaching our early access release date,

430
00:19:34,626 --> 00:19:36,968
and about 2,000 people had wish-listed our game

431
00:19:36,988 --> 00:19:38,029
through Steam.

432
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:40,791
We found, organized, and verified

433
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:45,475
a list of 300 press and content creators from various websites

434
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:46,836
and decided to send out a press release.

435
00:19:47,643 --> 00:19:50,725
Then we attached links to, in this press release,

436
00:19:50,765 --> 00:19:53,146
we attached links to appropriate places,

437
00:19:53,186 --> 00:19:55,707
like where to buy the game, links to our teaser trailer.

438
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,607
We attached some cool custom GIFs,

439
00:19:58,668 --> 00:19:59,368
and then we sent them out.

440
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:01,949
And this was in April, so.

441
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,830
This was for the teaser trailer,

442
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,391
and then a few months later,

443
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:08,892
a month before early access launch,

444
00:20:09,152 --> 00:20:11,253
we actually sent another wave of press release emails

445
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,053
with our early access launch trailer.

446
00:20:13,673 --> 00:20:14,994
Let's take a look at how these emails went.

447
00:20:16,463 --> 00:20:17,924
Okay, so that one went into the void,

448
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:19,044
so it's not very good.

449
00:20:19,064 --> 00:20:21,666
So that's okay.

450
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:23,847
So surely if we could get some influential

451
00:20:23,887 --> 00:20:24,967
content creators on board,

452
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:27,469
they would maybe help us out

453
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:29,430
and this would make the gaming press recognize us.

454
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:31,611
There were a lot of streamers

455
00:20:32,592 --> 00:20:34,213
and YouTube content creators at the time

456
00:20:34,253 --> 00:20:35,513
that we followed personally,

457
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,195
and so we decided to write some personalized emails

458
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:39,936
in the hopes that maybe they'll help us out

459
00:20:40,576 --> 00:20:42,937
and try the game that we worked so hard on for two years.

460
00:20:43,738 --> 00:20:44,818
Now let's take a look at these emails.

461
00:20:47,335 --> 00:20:50,177
They also went into the void.

462
00:20:50,518 --> 00:20:52,119
In total we sent over 600 emails

463
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,461
before we released Early Access,

464
00:20:54,801 --> 00:20:56,122
and we had gotten zero responses.

465
00:20:58,724 --> 00:20:59,765
Additionally, before release,

466
00:20:59,965 --> 00:21:01,446
we wanted streamers to pick up our game

467
00:21:01,486 --> 00:21:03,528
because streaming was obviously becoming a big thing.

468
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:05,770
So before we released the game.

469
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:10,864
We wanted certain streamers and content creators

470
00:21:11,284 --> 00:21:12,885
to get a sneak preview of Slay the Spire

471
00:21:13,366 --> 00:21:14,066
to hype up the game.

472
00:21:14,766 --> 00:21:17,408
This was a strategy done by, I believe,

473
00:21:17,428 --> 00:21:19,569
I forgot the name of the studio,

474
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:20,810
the guys that did Dead Cells.

475
00:21:22,191 --> 00:21:23,491
And so we were like, we'll do that.

476
00:21:23,691 --> 00:21:25,592
We heard of a tool called Keymailer,

477
00:21:26,073 --> 00:21:27,634
and this is a website slash tool

478
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:29,915
that allows you to send out Steam keys to content creators.

479
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:31,476
If you pay about

480
00:21:32,035 --> 00:21:35,517
I think there's a pro version that you pay $150 for.

481
00:21:36,277 --> 00:21:38,758
This lets you search for streamers based on what kinds

482
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,259
of games they played, what kind of games they streamed.

483
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:44,401
You can also see how much followers or subscribers they have.

484
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:49,163
So we decided to give that a go and sent out maybe 200 keys

485
00:21:49,203 --> 00:21:51,824
or so to people we thought would like our kind of game.

486
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,725
These are people who have streamed similar games

487
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:55,646
or made videos on similar games.

488
00:21:55,706 --> 00:21:58,007
These games are like Hearthstone or FTL,

489
00:21:58,927 --> 00:22:00,428
Darkest Dungeon and so forth.

490
00:22:01,843 --> 00:22:04,204
So then, the day finally came.

491
00:22:05,025 --> 00:22:06,266
We released on Early Access.

492
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,668
On November 14th, we were on Early Access,

493
00:22:09,768 --> 00:22:11,769
and anybody in the world could buy and play our game.

494
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,772
Leading to this, I made a countdown GIF

495
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:18,974
of like, our game's releasing in seven days,

496
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:20,575
and then I put it on Twitter,

497
00:22:21,056 --> 00:22:23,317
and the next day I said, our game's releasing in six days,

498
00:22:23,897 --> 00:22:25,418
and then I forgot there was some cool blurbs.

499
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,001
It was like, you can play cards and fight a guy in a shell,

500
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:29,901
and that's really cool.

501
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:33,196
So making gifts is a lot of work.

502
00:22:33,576 --> 00:22:37,199
So those seven days, I feel like I spent like a quarter

503
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:39,581
or like a long time making this.

504
00:22:40,441 --> 00:22:41,802
We also told all of our friends and family

505
00:22:41,822 --> 00:22:45,325
and we made an announcement on the Steam store page

506
00:22:45,685 --> 00:22:46,426
of the game itself.

507
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:48,487
We sent out those press emails,

508
00:22:48,727 --> 00:22:50,609
we sent out those Steam keys through Keymailer

509
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:52,850
and this latest bar sold 2,200 copies in the first two weeks.

510
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,441
Yeah, it's not too great.

511
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:05,702
So first two weeks, 2,200 copies, not too great.

512
00:23:07,543 --> 00:23:08,283
It was really exciting.

513
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:10,384
On day one, we sold about 300 copies.

514
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,765
On day two, we sold about 400 copies.

515
00:23:13,985 --> 00:23:16,006
But then on day three, we already

516
00:23:16,046 --> 00:23:17,486
started selling less and less copies.

517
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:18,086
We sold 200, and then 150.

518
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:23,470
and then 120, and then 90.

519
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,291
At this time, there was a tool,

520
00:23:27,731 --> 00:23:29,071
well, the tool still exists,

521
00:23:29,851 --> 00:23:31,151
but we'll talk about that another time.

522
00:23:31,831 --> 00:23:33,652
But the games that we looked at on this tool

523
00:23:34,652 --> 00:23:36,673
had a lot of information about sales data

524
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:39,513
and how much general sales that you would expect

525
00:23:40,413 --> 00:23:43,014
games to have during certain time windows.

526
00:23:44,274 --> 00:23:45,854
And we had noticed that a lot of other games,

527
00:23:46,315 --> 00:23:48,155
whether it's full release or early access,

528
00:23:48,415 --> 00:23:49,095
it doesn't really matter.

529
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:52,680
Most of the sales happened in the first two weeks.

530
00:23:53,821 --> 00:23:56,562
And so we were like, hmm, what's gonna happen?

531
00:23:58,122 --> 00:24:02,324
So what were we doing during these two initial weeks?

532
00:24:03,344 --> 00:24:04,865
Nothing too special actually.

533
00:24:05,505 --> 00:24:06,725
Although our sales weren't very good,

534
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:07,986
we just kinda kept working.

535
00:24:08,926 --> 00:24:10,227
After all, the game is in early access.

536
00:24:10,487 --> 00:24:12,328
It's not done yet.

537
00:24:12,748 --> 00:24:14,268
Surely the game will be successful

538
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:15,849
once we get into full release.

539
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:18,046
working on the game was comfortable,

540
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:20,407
because finally, instead of promoting the game,

541
00:24:20,547 --> 00:24:21,788
we could get back to working on the game,

542
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:23,689
and that's kind of like what we wanted to do

543
00:24:23,709 --> 00:24:25,150
this whole time, right, is work on the game,

544
00:24:25,691 --> 00:24:26,331
and finish the game.

545
00:24:27,672 --> 00:24:29,213
So we were kind of tired of all these,

546
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:30,974
like, making these promotion GIFs,

547
00:24:31,755 --> 00:24:34,516
sending out keys, finding people to give keys to,

548
00:24:34,677 --> 00:24:35,457
setting up a store.

549
00:24:35,577 --> 00:24:37,098
Setting up a store requires a lot of things,

550
00:24:37,158 --> 00:24:39,880
descriptions, screenshots, things like that, and so.

551
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,703
And on top of this, since our game was in early access,

552
00:24:43,823 --> 00:24:46,086
we promised to release a patch every single week.

553
00:24:46,987 --> 00:24:49,309
And this was to keep adding content, balance the game,

554
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,592
fix the bug, and get the game to completion.

555
00:24:52,753 --> 00:24:54,796
So, nothing had really changed.

556
00:24:54,896 --> 00:24:55,937
We went back to working on the game.

557
00:24:56,377 --> 00:24:58,400
And we were doing everything exactly the same way,

558
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,202
except we were pushing new builds to Steam

559
00:25:00,242 --> 00:25:00,803
every single week.

560
00:25:02,571 --> 00:25:06,015
Funny story, about nine months after early access release,

561
00:25:06,515 --> 00:25:08,517
we found out that our early access blurb

562
00:25:08,597 --> 00:25:10,700
on the Steam store page said that

563
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,341
we would be patching every two weeks.

564
00:25:12,822 --> 00:25:15,344
So we decided, apparently, to patch twice as often.

565
00:25:17,647 --> 00:25:18,928
So we noticed that a lot of reviews

566
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:21,671
mentioned that they saw their favorite streamer

567
00:25:21,711 --> 00:25:23,733
play the game, so they encouraged them to buy the game.

568
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,850
And so this was probably Keymailer,

569
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,191
so he said, good job, Keymailer.

570
00:25:27,811 --> 00:25:29,652
So I put a little promotion here.

571
00:25:29,672 --> 00:25:31,592
It says, Keymailer is great, five out of five.

572
00:25:32,033 --> 00:25:33,733
If you work for Keymailer, you may use this quote.

573
00:25:36,014 --> 00:25:36,254
Okay?

574
00:25:36,614 --> 00:25:41,536
So this encouraged us to send out more keys via Keymailer.

575
00:25:42,617 --> 00:25:46,718
This was probably our best investment when it came to time,

576
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:49,539
in terms of what we were doing to promote the game,

577
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:51,180
and money-wise, which was $150.

578
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:54,492
when it came to marketing slash advertising.

579
00:25:55,193 --> 00:25:57,535
Keymailer also felt like a more genuine way to reach players.

580
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,237
Reviewers didn't need to leave positive reviews.

581
00:26:00,457 --> 00:26:01,578
They were just given a free key.

582
00:26:02,178 --> 00:26:04,900
And they were, we just explained what the game is,

583
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,681
and they were given a free key.

584
00:26:06,781 --> 00:26:08,242
If they didn't want to play or review it,

585
00:26:08,263 --> 00:26:09,023
they didn't have to.

586
00:26:10,004 --> 00:26:12,306
So, and nothing implied that it had to be positive.

587
00:26:12,486 --> 00:26:14,507
So, if they wanted to play the game, they would play it.

588
00:26:15,502 --> 00:26:18,143
YouTube content creators started making some videos,

589
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,764
and then a few Twitch streamers also started streaming

590
00:26:20,784 --> 00:26:21,845
a game quite regularly.

591
00:26:22,365 --> 00:26:24,786
These were like recurring streamers,

592
00:26:24,986 --> 00:26:26,567
so someone who started playing earlier

593
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:28,908
would still be playing the game for a few weeks.

594
00:26:29,708 --> 00:26:32,049
And then it turns out the streamer community

595
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:34,931
is actually pretty tight-knit, which is a good thing.

596
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,352
Their friends started streaming the game,

597
00:26:37,612 --> 00:26:38,993
and then their friends started streaming the game.

598
00:26:41,863 --> 00:26:44,385
I'm not too sure what compelled the first few people

599
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:47,828
to start streaming our game or to create YouTube content.

600
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:50,831
Generally what they said was,

601
00:26:50,851 --> 00:26:54,574
I was given a key to this game and it looked interesting.

602
00:26:55,395 --> 00:26:58,618
It's a bit vague, but maybe a combination of our trailer,

603
00:26:58,818 --> 00:27:00,580
elevator pitch, or screenshots did their job.

604
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,902
But keep in mind that we did send keys to people

605
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,283
who had played similar games.

606
00:27:04,763 --> 00:27:08,046
And those keywords like roguelike, deck builder, and...

607
00:27:08,684 --> 00:27:10,825
single-player games, like single-player rogue-lite games,

608
00:27:10,965 --> 00:27:13,786
I think at the time were very fun and exciting.

609
00:27:13,906 --> 00:27:16,707
So I think that was it, but I can't say for sure.

610
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:22,150
So our initial success actually came on week three

611
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,051
after our early access launch.

612
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:26,111
There was a very high-profile streamer in China.

613
00:27:27,068 --> 00:27:29,210
that played our game as a very high-profile streamer.

614
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,111
The video of the stream went past a million views

615
00:27:32,792 --> 00:27:34,733
in a couple of days, and suddenly our game was flooded

616
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,714
with a lot of Chinese players who wanted to play our game,

617
00:27:37,954 --> 00:27:39,075
but they were having a hard time

618
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:41,556
because the game was only available in English at the time.

619
00:27:43,097 --> 00:27:44,738
More people in the US became interested

620
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:47,159
because it started showing up

621
00:27:47,219 --> 00:27:48,620
on the global top sellers list.

622
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:50,741
Many of the streamers who received the game

623
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:52,262
before early access were still playing,

624
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:54,643
and all their streamer friends also started playing.

625
00:27:55,135 --> 00:27:57,335
And eventually it reached more content creators.

626
00:27:58,055 --> 00:28:00,376
And then we showed up on top sellers list on Steam.

627
00:28:00,576 --> 00:28:03,576
And then showing up on a top sellers list on Steam

628
00:28:03,596 --> 00:28:04,796
apparently changes everything.

629
00:28:05,777 --> 00:28:09,177
Because we went from pretty good sales to crazy sales.

630
00:28:09,777 --> 00:28:12,238
Around the same time we also went on sale.

631
00:28:13,178 --> 00:28:15,758
And so apparently having a game on sale is also good.

632
00:28:16,098 --> 00:28:17,559
So these all kind of compounded together.

633
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:21,019
And then this happened.

634
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:23,060
This blue line spike happened.

635
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,234
And it was great, and everything was,

636
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:28,055
the game was very popular suddenly.

637
00:28:30,235 --> 00:28:30,695
I would say,

638
00:28:30,715 --> 00:28:35,856
another endorsement by myself, just so you know.

639
00:28:38,477 --> 00:28:39,877
So I would say that most of our success

640
00:28:39,957 --> 00:28:41,878
actually came from people genuinely playing the game

641
00:28:41,898 --> 00:28:42,578
and enjoying the game.

642
00:28:43,358 --> 00:28:45,818
I think that Twitch and products like Twitch

643
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:47,999
are a godsend for games like ours.

644
00:28:48,904 --> 00:28:53,989
A game that isn't visually beautiful or even interesting on paper can now become wildly popular.

645
00:28:56,432 --> 00:29:01,637
And there's also another game that's similar right now, which is fairly unknown, or maybe it is known.

646
00:29:02,118 --> 00:29:05,522
It's a mod for a game called Dota 2, and it's called Auto Chess.

647
00:29:06,303 --> 00:29:10,007
And although on paper it sounds like a mess, it's a mod for a video game.

648
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:13,100
and the art style is Dota 2 and you should play it.

649
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,360
And that game is really fun.

650
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,381
And so people are playing it,

651
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:18,681
and people like,

652
00:29:21,202 --> 00:29:23,683
can't name like Twitch streamers off the top of my head.

653
00:29:23,903 --> 00:29:26,504
Like Amaz and stuff are playing the game on Twitch,

654
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:28,104
and it's doing really well.

655
00:29:29,164 --> 00:29:30,425
Because streamers talk openly

656
00:29:30,465 --> 00:29:31,605
about what they're thinking about,

657
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:34,866
I feel that users can play vicariously through streamers

658
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:36,726
by watching them on top of this.

659
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,142
If these games continually become updated and polished,

660
00:29:40,642 --> 00:29:41,803
why would you ever stop playing them?

661
00:29:43,064 --> 00:29:45,346
While we intentionally designed Slay to be fun to watch,

662
00:29:46,127 --> 00:29:48,068
it was a great coincidence and luck for us

663
00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:51,271
that Twitch was and still is growing as a platform.

664
00:29:53,553 --> 00:29:56,355
So if your game is popular in a format where people watch,

665
00:29:56,896 --> 00:29:59,798
people watch other people play Watch, what did I type here?

666
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:02,640
OK.

667
00:30:04,282 --> 00:30:06,243
I'm going to go ahead and get Casey.

668
00:30:08,163 --> 00:30:11,064
So to make games that are popular for like streamers

669
00:30:11,185 --> 00:30:12,045
and people who play the game,

670
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,346
instead of focusing on marketing,

671
00:30:14,386 --> 00:30:16,186
we focused on something called marketability.

672
00:30:17,687 --> 00:30:19,047
And this is a bit different from marketing.

673
00:30:19,527 --> 00:30:22,048
Marketability is the ability of a video game

674
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:23,769
to be sold or marketed.

675
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:26,870
So our lack of response from trailers,

676
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,151
our screenshots, our press emails, our website work,

677
00:30:31,051 --> 00:30:34,232
was very small in comparison to the response we got

678
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:35,393
whenever we updated the game.

679
00:30:38,272 --> 00:30:40,573
So we finally got to marketability,

680
00:30:41,653 --> 00:30:42,734
but it's really important.

681
00:30:43,154 --> 00:30:45,775
And that's because the context of why we developed the game

682
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:48,817
the way we did is so important.

683
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:52,539
We've been making games a very old-fashioned way.

684
00:30:53,239 --> 00:30:55,621
And the combination of three things, which is streaming,

685
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:59,162
communities, and the fact that we could update easily

686
00:30:59,322 --> 00:31:02,664
allowed us to take this path of marketability

687
00:31:03,224 --> 00:31:06,006
rather than trying to market the game before we sell the game.

688
00:31:09,757 --> 00:31:12,480
So what we wanted to do was the product sell itself,

689
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,443
which was like, I think this is the dream for developers,

690
00:31:16,643 --> 00:31:17,965
because you just get to work on the game.

691
00:31:19,566 --> 00:31:21,848
And so in order to accomplish this dream,

692
00:31:21,868 --> 00:31:23,289
you need to have a strong pipeline.

693
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:27,173
I guess to put it simply, it would

694
00:31:27,213 --> 00:31:30,776
be having a good method for acquiring feedback, pushing out

695
00:31:30,856 --> 00:31:33,378
updates, and a good way to talk to your community.

696
00:31:38,992 --> 00:31:40,493
All right, and so for pushing updates,

697
00:31:41,294 --> 00:31:43,295
FlateAspire got an update every single week

698
00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:45,856
on the main branch during early access.

699
00:31:46,657 --> 00:31:49,339
Between November 14th and then January 23rd,

700
00:31:49,479 --> 00:31:51,100
which is when we did the full release,

701
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,161
the game was patched 57 times.

702
00:31:55,382 --> 00:31:56,763
One month after early access,

703
00:31:57,664 --> 00:31:58,944
we also created a beta branch

704
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,686
so that players could get a sneak preview

705
00:32:00,906 --> 00:32:04,448
of upcoming content, bug fixes, and so forth

706
00:32:04,568 --> 00:32:07,170
that we can test out things like experimental features.

707
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:11,779
We think that having a beta branch is necessary

708
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:15,180
for weekly patching, because we don't have a dedicated QA team.

709
00:32:16,181 --> 00:32:18,181
Whenever we edit anything, there's

710
00:32:18,201 --> 00:32:19,422
a risk that things could break.

711
00:32:20,062 --> 00:32:22,202
And sometimes we'd be up pretty late,

712
00:32:22,642 --> 00:32:23,803
accidentally breaking stuff.

713
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:26,143
And then we'd fix that, but then that would actually

714
00:32:26,163 --> 00:32:26,724
break it more.

715
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:29,664
And then we'd be like, why won't I just roll back?

716
00:32:29,684 --> 00:32:31,325
And if you roll back, you don't have new features,

717
00:32:31,345 --> 00:32:32,265
and now it's not exciting.

718
00:32:32,905 --> 00:32:34,166
So we broke the game a lot.

719
00:32:34,726 --> 00:32:36,646
And I don't think people should be afraid of.

720
00:32:37,535 --> 00:32:38,155
breaking the game.

721
00:32:38,395 --> 00:32:40,336
It's part of, at least for early access.

722
00:32:40,676 --> 00:32:42,957
If it's full release, then it should be pretty stable.

723
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:46,719
Some pros and cons of weekly patching.

724
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:47,740
New stuff is always happening.

725
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,001
So new stuff, players are always getting new stuff.

726
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:51,402
There's always excitement.

727
00:32:52,182 --> 00:32:54,283
And it's very fun to see what players want

728
00:32:54,343 --> 00:32:55,464
and expect from a new patch.

729
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,445
And it also gives us ideas.

730
00:32:57,585 --> 00:33:00,046
Sometimes we're about to work on something

731
00:33:00,426 --> 00:33:01,427
that we think is exciting,

732
00:33:01,907 --> 00:33:02,948
but then the player is like,

733
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:06,139
you know, it would be really great if they worked on this thing,

734
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:08,520
and then everyone's like, yeah, I bet they're working on this thing.

735
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,141
And then we're like, yes, we are working on that thing.

736
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,722
That's exactly what we're working on.

737
00:33:15,482 --> 00:33:19,384
And so sometimes, you know, what people want is what drives what we work on.

738
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:22,665
Also, if you patch weekly,

739
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:26,767
it's a good time to address problems and discussions

740
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:28,587
that people are having about the game,

741
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:29,908
so it can be more transparent.

742
00:33:31,152 --> 00:33:32,312
You can discuss what's coming soon.

743
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:36,434
And of course, if you need help with anything,

744
00:33:37,175 --> 00:33:41,237
such as for us, we had started localizing the game,

745
00:33:41,997 --> 00:33:43,378
and we needed more people to help us

746
00:33:43,718 --> 00:33:44,698
community translate the game.

747
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,640
And so during these weekly announcements,

748
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,780
we can ask for help and be like,

749
00:33:49,141 --> 00:33:50,321
we're looking for translators,

750
00:33:50,721 --> 00:33:51,902
and we did get a lot of translators,

751
00:33:52,162 --> 00:33:55,064
but we'll talk about that on the localization slide.

752
00:33:56,444 --> 00:33:59,046
For cons, whoops, whoa there, calm down.

753
00:33:59,106 --> 00:33:59,686
For cons.

754
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:03,625
Oh, it's too zoomed out.

755
00:34:04,265 --> 00:34:04,545
All right.

756
00:34:05,005 --> 00:34:07,386
For cons of weekly patching, I would say that

757
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:09,826
there are just some features that take longer

758
00:34:09,886 --> 00:34:10,907
to make than one week.

759
00:34:11,747 --> 00:34:13,527
And so if you're working on something like that,

760
00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:15,668
or if you're working on content

761
00:34:15,728 --> 00:34:16,968
that is not ready to be revealed,

762
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:19,929
you're going to have a patch that's not very exciting.

763
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:21,769
And so you can have some slow weeks.

764
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,850
Another one is writing up an announcement

765
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:28,711
and getting it proofread.

766
00:34:30,183 --> 00:34:32,765
It takes a lot of work and then you have to push the patch

767
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:35,087
and then you have to monitor the patch for issues.

768
00:34:35,627 --> 00:34:37,308
So it was actually costing us

769
00:34:37,588 --> 00:34:38,929
one day of productivity a week.

770
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,171
So if you work five days a week,

771
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:43,613
then you're losing 20% of productivity

772
00:34:44,113 --> 00:34:45,995
just by pushing out weekly patches.

773
00:34:47,196 --> 00:34:50,318
If you were to get sick, if you were to get injured,

774
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,821
if you were moving or you were on jury duty

775
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:57,443
or maybe somebody got married, I'm married.

776
00:34:59,113 --> 00:35:02,834
then these can make weekly patches pretty rough.

777
00:35:03,555 --> 00:35:05,836
So my solution is, if I could do it again,

778
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,597
I would do two weeks.

779
00:35:07,917 --> 00:35:09,497
Every two weeks, like I said, I would.

780
00:35:10,878 --> 00:35:16,400
Okay, so when it came to talking to people

781
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,642
through Steam announcements, that was a very good thing

782
00:35:19,842 --> 00:35:21,002
because that's where everyone buys the game,

783
00:35:21,062 --> 00:35:22,303
so everyone actually read those announcements,

784
00:35:22,323 --> 00:35:23,083
which was fantastic.

785
00:35:23,908 --> 00:35:25,369
Whenever we posted announcements on Steam,

786
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,051
it would be cross-posted to places like Discord,

787
00:35:28,891 --> 00:35:30,252
Twitter, and our Facebook channels.

788
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:32,053
Reddit is community-driven,

789
00:35:32,193 --> 00:35:33,234
so you don't have to post anything there.

790
00:35:33,394 --> 00:35:34,575
Somebody will find it and post it.

791
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,936
And then, I think Twitch streamers also,

792
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:38,457
if the game is patched,

793
00:35:38,757 --> 00:35:40,178
they'll briefly go over the patch notes,

794
00:35:40,318 --> 00:35:41,298
which were available in-game,

795
00:35:41,779 --> 00:35:43,239
so they would just read off of it and be like,

796
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,820
oh, the game is completely different now.

797
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:46,842
Now it's way harder or way easier.

798
00:35:47,942 --> 00:35:49,803
So, it's not way harder or easier.

799
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,084
They're minor balance patches.

800
00:35:54,304 --> 00:35:57,366
So from these announcements, we try to funnel people into our Discord channel, because that's

801
00:35:57,386 --> 00:35:58,006
what we preferred.

802
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:02,329
We found it to be the easiest format in where we can communicate with our players in real

803
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:02,569
time.

804
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:06,391
If they had issues, they can post pictures, they can ask questions, we can answer, follow-up

805
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:07,212
questions we can answer.

806
00:36:08,372 --> 00:36:13,615
We also had an internal testing tool during our private testing, and this was a bot called

807
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:14,216
Feedback Bot.

808
00:36:16,657 --> 00:36:18,598
So Feedback Bot is very useful, but apparently I'm

809
00:36:18,638 --> 00:36:19,678
talking about it in the next slide.

810
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,160
So in terms of usefulness of each

811
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,401
of these different social media and community channels,

812
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:27,463
I would say that for issues, we generally

813
00:36:27,503 --> 00:36:30,765
try to funnel people to Steam's discussion boards, where

814
00:36:30,785 --> 00:36:32,406
we had kind of like a troubleshooting guide.

815
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:34,888
And then if all else failed, we would

816
00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:37,990
ask them to email us at support at megacrit.com.

817
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:41,212
If we wanted to talk about the game or work on localization,

818
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,133
we'd be exchanging files all the time.

819
00:36:43,593 --> 00:36:44,734
That was usually done in Discord.

820
00:36:45,374 --> 00:36:45,615
And then

821
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:49,439
Places where chaos and crazy things happen

822
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,481
was community-driven sites like Reddit.

823
00:36:51,821 --> 00:36:53,082
So we didn't control anything in Reddit.

824
00:36:53,482 --> 00:36:54,883
Things just happened on the internet,

825
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:56,704
and that's where it happens apparently.

826
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,606
So I think if anything goes wrong,

827
00:36:59,946 --> 00:37:02,368
we always try to acknowledge problems or issues

828
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:03,949
that are happening in public.

829
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,471
If there's a bug, we just fix it,

830
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:07,751
and then we just push out a patch.

831
00:37:09,412 --> 00:37:11,794
That's something that only small teams can do.

832
00:37:12,074 --> 00:37:13,495
I know that if you're on a much larger team.

833
00:37:14,242 --> 00:37:16,002
You can't just be like, here's the bug,

834
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:17,723
and I'll be like, I'll fix it and push it.

835
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:18,864
Now it's fixed in 20 minutes.

836
00:37:19,564 --> 00:37:20,945
But that was something that we were allowed to do.

837
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:23,566
And I think that was very fortunate for our small team.

838
00:37:25,627 --> 00:37:28,369
So we talked about the bots earlier.

839
00:37:28,889 --> 00:37:31,430
So we had a bot when we were doing internal testing.

840
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,651
And this was called Feedback Bot.

841
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:36,353
And Feedback Bot is very great.

842
00:37:36,513 --> 00:37:38,994
One of our playtesters during internal playtesting

843
00:37:39,054 --> 00:37:39,854
actually made it for us.

844
00:37:40,701 --> 00:37:43,888
And what this does is it allows you to talk to a bot

845
00:37:44,811 --> 00:37:47,116
by saying things like bug, colon,

846
00:37:47,176 --> 00:37:48,399
and then you write something like bug.

847
00:37:49,773 --> 00:37:53,294
this enemy is too strong and then our feedback bot,

848
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,055
which is renamed to SpireBot for Discord,

849
00:37:55,435 --> 00:37:56,676
would say, thanks for your feedback.

850
00:37:57,736 --> 00:37:59,637
I was gonna point at the slides and read off them,

851
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:01,478
but it turns out it's very far.

852
00:38:02,078 --> 00:38:06,220
So, to date, we have 18,000 points of feedback from people.

853
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,361
These can be things like suggestions,

854
00:38:09,341 --> 00:38:11,662
ideas, and things of that nature.

855
00:38:13,398 --> 00:38:15,319
I think that bugs are really important

856
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:16,179
to make your product better.

857
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:18,079
You should always be thankful of problems.

858
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,421
And even if people file duplicates of issues,

859
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:23,742
it's like, oh, these guys filed duplicates.

860
00:38:23,842 --> 00:38:24,522
It shouldn't be like that.

861
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:26,202
It's like, wow, this is a serious problem.

862
00:38:26,362 --> 00:38:28,183
Like 25 people are noticing this bug.

863
00:38:28,883 --> 00:38:31,284
So duplicates actually let you know the severity of issues.

864
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:32,745
And so it's also good.

865
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:35,126
If possible, we should ask for more information.

866
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:36,606
That's why we prefer Discord.

867
00:38:37,186 --> 00:38:39,447
Whenever anybody talked about an issue.

868
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:41,954
we would just follow up with them.

869
00:38:41,974 --> 00:38:43,155
We'd be like, how did this happen?

870
00:38:43,675 --> 00:38:44,656
What is your computer like?

871
00:38:45,097 --> 00:38:47,279
Are you using an interesting game controller?

872
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,402
So, I think we should always be thanking our community

873
00:38:50,603 --> 00:38:52,545
for doing a job that requires the whole QA team.

874
00:38:53,686 --> 00:38:54,987
And that would cost a lot of money.

875
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,410
As someone who's worked in QA, I would say,

876
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,833
I'm glad that people QA your game for free.

877
00:39:01,033 --> 00:39:02,635
That only happens in video games, I think.

878
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:04,431
Alright.

879
00:39:06,312 --> 00:39:09,314
So, to make our game more marketable,

880
00:39:09,374 --> 00:39:11,476
we also had a lot of design considerations.

881
00:39:12,456 --> 00:39:14,178
Some of these things are about making a game

882
00:39:14,198 --> 00:39:16,779
with complex mechanics easy to understand.

883
00:39:16,799 --> 00:39:19,481
And this is a really large undertaking.

884
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:21,983
And it could probably be a talk on its own.

885
00:39:22,804 --> 00:39:25,486
But we're gonna go over just a few of them.

886
00:39:26,086 --> 00:39:28,228
Card games have a rich history of complex mechanics.

887
00:39:29,288 --> 00:39:30,509
There's a bunch of different layers,

888
00:39:30,529 --> 00:39:31,770
there's a bunch of different interactions.

889
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:33,311
Fortunately for us.

890
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,861
we could leverage existing mechanics and terminology

891
00:39:37,461 --> 00:39:38,842
in these games for our game.

892
00:39:39,782 --> 00:39:41,523
Because Slay the Spire was always intended

893
00:39:41,563 --> 00:39:42,983
to be just a digital card game,

894
00:39:43,704 --> 00:39:46,225
we were allowed to keep the visual clutter to a minimum.

895
00:39:47,545 --> 00:39:49,966
Some examples of digital card games are

896
00:39:50,726 --> 00:39:52,907
that the rules are enforced programmatically.

897
00:39:53,728 --> 00:39:55,568
So if you wanted to take a card

898
00:39:56,209 --> 00:39:57,149
and do something strange with it,

899
00:39:57,329 --> 00:40:00,250
like if you wanted to take a card from your draw pile

900
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,431
and discard it immediately,

901
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:04,107
You couldn't just do that, because the game would say no.

902
00:40:04,808 --> 00:40:05,869
The code doesn't allow it, right?

903
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:09,332
Complex mechanics, such as statuses,

904
00:40:10,433 --> 00:40:11,754
things like keywords for each card.

905
00:40:12,294 --> 00:40:14,637
These definitions would appear when you hover over a card.

906
00:40:15,077 --> 00:40:19,061
So a card can be like, apply to vulnerable.

907
00:40:19,081 --> 00:40:21,463
And you'd be like, what's apply to vulnerable mean?

908
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:23,344
And you hover over it and say, vulnerable

909
00:40:23,424 --> 00:40:25,146
is enemies take 50% more damage.

910
00:40:25,246 --> 00:40:27,188
And you're like, oh, thanks, keyword tip person.

911
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:32,031
You can also show tutorials or blurbs if the player does something wrong.

912
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:37,073
In the GIF here, you can see that our player is trying to play these cards.

913
00:40:37,373 --> 00:40:38,373
Come on, loop please.

914
00:40:39,593 --> 00:40:42,174
So it's like, oh look, we're playing a strike and we're trying to play this bash.

915
00:40:42,735 --> 00:40:43,875
Oh, we can't, we're out of energy.

916
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:45,456
I'm gonna try again.

917
00:40:45,476 --> 00:40:49,477
Oh, no you can't, you really can't.

918
00:40:49,717 --> 00:40:51,378
So, we show like some more like...

919
00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:54,562
We show tips that have more words

920
00:40:55,143 --> 00:40:56,985
and try to make sure the player understands what's going on

921
00:40:57,865 --> 00:40:59,487
if they continue to not understand something.

922
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:01,189
So that's something we've gotten from

923
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,791
just like playtesting more in person.

924
00:41:04,752 --> 00:41:06,254
Because sometimes you would see like thought bubble

925
00:41:06,294 --> 00:41:07,775
that says, I cannot play this.

926
00:41:08,055 --> 00:41:09,076
And sometimes they would ignore it.

927
00:41:09,637 --> 00:41:10,678
So we added those kind of things.

928
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,582
Things like, what other things that are useful

929
00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:15,362
for digital card games?

930
00:41:16,255 --> 00:41:17,617
You can view your deck instantly.

931
00:41:17,717 --> 00:41:19,999
You just push a button, and you'll see a grid of cards.

932
00:41:20,139 --> 00:41:20,920
You can see your whole deck.

933
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,121
You don't have to fan through them individually.

934
00:41:23,882 --> 00:41:27,065
The game shuffles cards for you, things of that nature.

935
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:30,568
In a video game, there's also a bunch of other stuff

936
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:30,868
you can do.

937
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:31,949
There's so much things you can do.

938
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:33,351
There's so much UX design.

939
00:41:34,011 --> 00:41:35,052
If you look closely at the image,

940
00:41:35,072 --> 00:41:37,634
you can see things like the cards that are playable

941
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:38,816
have a blue outline.

942
00:41:39,736 --> 00:41:41,918
The cards where you don't have enough energy, the text is red.

943
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:45,305
And there's also audio and visual cues.

944
00:41:45,825 --> 00:41:47,585
We make the sound when you can't play a card.

945
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,046
When you play a card, there'll be a trail,

946
00:41:50,146 --> 00:41:52,426
and the card will fly into like discard pile.

947
00:41:52,786 --> 00:41:56,827
When the card, you know, when cards need to shuffle,

948
00:41:57,188 --> 00:41:59,288
there'll be like an animation of all the cards

949
00:41:59,328 --> 00:42:01,049
going from discard pile into draw pile.

950
00:42:01,629 --> 00:42:02,569
So those kind of things here.

951
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:04,549
Less words, good.

952
00:42:05,897 --> 00:42:08,138
What we mean by this is to make our,

953
00:42:08,918 --> 00:42:11,799
so our game was focused a lot on its content

954
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:13,919
and playing the game, and it wasn't very lore heavy.

955
00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:16,120
However, there is some lore,

956
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,900
and you can get through this lore,

957
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,541
but we also didn't want to make it mandatory.

958
00:42:22,141 --> 00:42:24,121
Things like events in our game,

959
00:42:25,102 --> 00:42:26,982
you don't need to read all the words,

960
00:42:27,182 --> 00:42:29,143
you can just look at the options,

961
00:42:29,323 --> 00:42:31,063
and the options tell you exactly what's going to happen.

962
00:42:31,623 --> 00:42:34,924
And this was very important for the streamability of the game.

963
00:42:35,878 --> 00:42:37,479
because then players could look at the options

964
00:42:37,499 --> 00:42:39,320
that are available and then follow those options.

965
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:42,821
Alright, so for localization.

966
00:42:44,302 --> 00:42:45,703
Localization, if you don't know,

967
00:42:45,783 --> 00:42:48,524
is translating your game to multiple languages

968
00:42:48,584 --> 00:42:50,025
so people in other countries can play the game.

969
00:42:50,725 --> 00:42:54,307
This is our sales data from two weeks after the EA release

970
00:42:55,768 --> 00:42:57,008
to six weeks after release.

971
00:42:58,529 --> 00:43:01,691
Things that are really important here is that China.

972
00:43:02,968 --> 00:43:05,729
made up 42% of all the sales during this time.

973
00:43:06,429 --> 00:43:08,370
And if you combine all the English-speaking countries

974
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:10,250
on this pie chart, it's 41%.

975
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:13,311
And this was before any localization

976
00:43:13,351 --> 00:43:14,291
was available in the game.

977
00:43:14,631 --> 00:43:16,191
So there were a lot of confused players.

978
00:43:17,531 --> 00:43:19,352
And so we started our localization efforts.

979
00:43:19,832 --> 00:43:21,272
And the game is now translated to,

980
00:43:23,273 --> 00:43:24,813
actually I added one or two more recently.

981
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:28,193
So it should be around 16 to 18 languages.

982
00:43:28,874 --> 00:43:30,334
So we moved forward one year.

983
00:43:31,472 --> 00:43:32,272
we can see what happens.

984
00:43:32,972 --> 00:43:34,933
You definitely want to plan ahead for localization.

985
00:43:35,473 --> 00:43:37,394
If you are a programmer, you understand

986
00:43:37,434 --> 00:43:38,855
what it means to hard-code strings.

987
00:43:39,815 --> 00:43:42,596
Don't hard-code strings, although we didn't.

988
00:43:44,157 --> 00:43:45,738
And make your game localizable.

989
00:43:45,758 --> 00:43:47,639
You should always try to make your game

990
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:49,780
available to as much people as possible, for sure.

991
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,601
There's also other considerations to make.

992
00:43:53,261 --> 00:43:57,803
A lot of engines would render certain languages differently,

993
00:43:57,943 --> 00:43:59,864
certain texts differently, certain fonts differently.

994
00:44:00,405 --> 00:44:03,906
If you include all the fonts, your game can get pretty big pretty fast.

995
00:44:05,006 --> 00:44:07,427
Some fonts have very strange text formatting rules,

996
00:44:07,787 --> 00:44:09,227
such as a lack of spaces.

997
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:12,448
And since our game also incorporated symbols

998
00:44:12,868 --> 00:44:15,049
and keywords that have special logic appendants to them,

999
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:18,070
it was very, very difficult to translate our game.

1000
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:21,230
And we're still working on a few languages as well.

1001
00:44:22,211 --> 00:44:24,091
So we worked with community translators.

1002
00:44:24,791 --> 00:44:29,593
We actually initially started with a professional localization company.

1003
00:44:30,713 --> 00:44:34,514
And because we released a patch every week with new content,

1004
00:44:35,055 --> 00:44:36,115
it would always be outdated.

1005
00:44:36,135 --> 00:44:38,256
It would always be behind by two or three weeks.

1006
00:44:39,056 --> 00:44:42,578
And on top of that, a lot of the community translations

1007
00:44:43,038 --> 00:44:44,799
were a bit better because they played the game.

1008
00:44:44,979 --> 00:44:49,481
And so a game with a lot of technical keywords and terms

1009
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:52,822
just made more sense for somebody who played the game.

1010
00:44:53,702 --> 00:44:55,323
I think that it's very important for card games

1011
00:44:55,723 --> 00:44:58,084
that anyone who translates it knows what's going on.

1012
00:45:00,713 --> 00:45:04,914
All right, so lesson here is don't ignore China

1013
00:45:04,934 --> 00:45:08,755
and translate your game to a bunch of languages.

1014
00:45:08,775 --> 00:45:10,435
I was going to point out to some stuff

1015
00:45:10,515 --> 00:45:12,496
and be like, wow, look, all these other languages that.

1016
00:45:13,056 --> 00:45:14,736
So there's a bunch of extra countries

1017
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:16,636
here that were not available in the previous slide.

1018
00:45:17,357 --> 00:45:20,197
You can see in this slide that I can't see it anymore

1019
00:45:20,497 --> 00:45:22,358
because my eyes are not that good.

1020
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,491
But what happens is, after you translate the game,

1021
00:45:25,811 --> 00:45:28,392
countries like Korea, Japan, Russia,

1022
00:45:28,412 --> 00:45:29,772
all start buying your game as well.

1023
00:45:30,273 --> 00:45:33,254
And they make up quite a sizable amount of players.

1024
00:45:35,374 --> 00:45:37,955
Hardware compatibility, no one wants to stutter your game,

1025
00:45:37,995 --> 00:45:38,875
so optimize your game.

1026
00:45:40,016 --> 00:45:42,336
So I think there's been a lot of different studies,

1027
00:45:42,356 --> 00:45:43,797
I wish I could just link all the studies,

1028
00:45:43,817 --> 00:45:44,477
why didn't I do that?

1029
00:45:45,257 --> 00:45:47,118
But like, there are studies like,

1030
00:45:47,158 --> 00:45:48,858
if a website loads slightly slower,

1031
00:45:48,978 --> 00:45:50,639
people are less inclined to go to that website.

1032
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:54,167
What else?

1033
00:45:56,028 --> 00:45:58,130
There's a lot of compatibility requirements

1034
00:45:58,270 --> 00:45:58,891
that need to be done.

1035
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:02,013
So we looked at the Steam hardware survey,

1036
00:46:02,213 --> 00:46:02,914
that's the easiest way.

1037
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:03,775
We're selling on Steam,

1038
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:05,096
so we're gonna look at the Steam hardware survey.

1039
00:46:06,342 --> 00:46:08,163
We found that a lot of enlightening facts,

1040
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,804
which is very publicly available,

1041
00:46:10,885 --> 00:46:12,746
the biggest one for us was definitely that

1042
00:46:13,306 --> 00:46:15,328
so many users are playing on very low resolution.

1043
00:46:15,688 --> 00:46:18,570
And this is something we looked up very early on,

1044
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:22,132
and it's very important because this determines

1045
00:46:22,652 --> 00:46:24,714
the minimum text size that you can have in a game.

1046
00:46:25,314 --> 00:46:26,615
I feel like that there are a lot of games

1047
00:46:26,775 --> 00:46:29,337
out there right now where developers assume

1048
00:46:29,357 --> 00:46:30,718
that everybody's playing on 1080p,

1049
00:46:31,258 --> 00:46:32,379
and the text is very small,

1050
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:33,459
and they just become little...

1051
00:46:34,558 --> 00:46:36,699
blurry smidges on the screen if you get too small.

1052
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,202
There are also other considerations like RAM,

1053
00:46:41,482 --> 00:46:42,262
which is a big deal.

1054
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:46,144
So, and yeah, those are all the facts here

1055
00:46:46,545 --> 00:46:47,765
that I've got that I thought were important.

1056
00:46:48,606 --> 00:46:49,947
Oh, we also found out a lot of people

1057
00:46:49,967 --> 00:46:50,967
like playing games with controllers.

1058
00:46:51,467 --> 00:46:52,428
So we do controller support.

1059
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:58,912
All right, so that's kind of all the things we did

1060
00:46:59,312 --> 00:47:01,293
in terms of marketability, I would say.

1061
00:47:02,534 --> 00:47:03,454
I guess these days.

1062
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:05,835
We're trying to make the game more available.

1063
00:47:06,835 --> 00:47:07,876
I think you saw on the other slides

1064
00:47:07,936 --> 00:47:10,177
that we made the game available in more languages.

1065
00:47:10,558 --> 00:47:12,899
We made it available on Mac OS, Linux.

1066
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:15,400
We did Windows 32-bit.

1067
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,101
That was maybe a mistake.

1068
00:47:18,162 --> 00:47:21,784
And that's not because Windows 32-bit is bad.

1069
00:47:22,204 --> 00:47:24,685
It's just, I think anyone who still has

1070
00:47:24,725 --> 00:47:28,047
Windows 32-bit installed might have a computer

1071
00:47:28,067 --> 00:47:29,028
that cannot run anything.

1072
00:47:33,398 --> 00:47:35,539
So these days we're working on porting,

1073
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:37,600
and we're actually planning on porting the game

1074
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,142
to a bunch of different platforms from the beginning.

1075
00:47:40,322 --> 00:47:41,543
The Nintendo Switch was announced

1076
00:47:41,943 --> 00:47:43,063
while we were working on the game.

1077
00:47:43,704 --> 00:47:46,405
So we actually need to, I think,

1078
00:47:47,246 --> 00:47:49,547
work with a, we are working with a porting company,

1079
00:47:49,787 --> 00:47:51,648
and it's gonna be probably on a different engine.

1080
00:47:53,382 --> 00:47:54,042
things like mobile.

1081
00:47:54,983 --> 00:47:58,706
So, not sure if you know, but Slate Aspire can be totally

1082
00:47:58,746 --> 00:48:00,047
played with just mouse and keyboard.

1083
00:48:00,508 --> 00:48:02,229
Just mouse, not keyboard, Casey.

1084
00:48:02,349 --> 00:48:03,070
That's the whole point.

1085
00:48:05,211 --> 00:48:05,692
And so, yeah.

1086
00:48:09,575 --> 00:48:11,497
So, something I noticed when making this presentation

1087
00:48:12,277 --> 00:48:14,379
was that Anthony and I attempted game development

1088
00:48:14,419 --> 00:48:14,819
10 years ago.

1089
00:48:15,961 --> 00:48:17,301
and it failed spectacularly.

1090
00:48:17,982 --> 00:48:19,383
And then six or seven years later,

1091
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:21,945
we quit our pretty good jobs

1092
00:48:22,405 --> 00:48:24,407
and attempted indie game development again.

1093
00:48:26,048 --> 00:48:27,589
When we started the indie game development again,

1094
00:48:27,689 --> 00:48:29,070
we worked for two years without pay,

1095
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:31,672
and there wasn't really any notion

1096
00:48:31,732 --> 00:48:32,853
that we would be successful.

1097
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:35,254
I think that it just means that

1098
00:48:35,655 --> 00:48:37,416
if you really, really wanna make video games,

1099
00:48:39,217 --> 00:48:40,018
you're just gonna do it.

1100
00:48:40,578 --> 00:48:41,639
So I hope that.

1101
00:48:43,002 --> 00:48:46,025
Anything that we write about, anything that I say today

1102
00:48:46,145 --> 00:48:46,746
can help you out.

1103
00:48:47,487 --> 00:48:48,928
And yeah, thanks for playing our game.

1104
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,970
And thank you for coming to my talk.

1105
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:01,222
Yeah.

1106
00:49:01,302 --> 00:49:03,184
Questions and answers?

1107
00:49:03,264 --> 00:49:03,985
Is that what it's saying?

1108
00:49:04,005 --> 00:49:04,065
Q&A?

1109
00:49:04,105 --> 00:49:04,485
Yeah, Q&A.

1110
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:08,572
Hey, when you were doing your weekly patches,

1111
00:49:09,032 --> 00:49:11,013
were you doing it on the beta branch?

1112
00:49:11,313 --> 00:49:13,294
And if so, how often did you push the live branch?

1113
00:49:13,314 --> 00:49:14,154
Oh, good question.

1114
00:49:15,235 --> 00:49:19,417
So we always pushed an update on the main branch weekly.

1115
00:49:19,437 --> 00:49:21,298
And on the beta branch, we actually

1116
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:26,921
push five times a week, which sounds like a lot.

1117
00:49:27,101 --> 00:49:29,122
But the beta branch, the expectations are lower.

1118
00:49:29,262 --> 00:49:30,423
If it breaks, it's kind of funny.

1119
00:49:31,553 --> 00:49:33,194
A lot of funny things happened in the beta branch.

1120
00:49:34,134 --> 00:49:35,694
We made a new character, it was not ready yet.

1121
00:49:35,754 --> 00:49:36,955
We drew a bunch of art for it.

1122
00:49:37,435 --> 00:49:39,555
And the bad art, people like the bad art.

1123
00:49:40,076 --> 00:49:41,856
The bad art is actually in the game now

1124
00:49:42,136 --> 00:49:43,676
that you can toggle on if you beat the game

1125
00:49:43,876 --> 00:49:44,877
at the hardest difficulty.

1126
00:49:46,677 --> 00:49:48,338
But yeah, we patched very, very frequently

1127
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:49,878
in the beta branch, almost every day.

1128
00:49:49,898 --> 00:49:51,678
Yeah.

1129
00:49:52,566 --> 00:49:55,027
Yeah, one of the key elements to the game, I thought,

1130
00:49:55,068 --> 00:49:57,549
was the feedback loop that you had with the community.

1131
00:49:57,849 --> 00:50:01,692
Could you elaborate on how you triaged what part of feedback

1132
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:04,233
or what player's feedback you value the most

1133
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:05,534
or anything around that process?

1134
00:50:05,854 --> 00:50:11,337
Yes, so whenever somebody types something in Discord,

1135
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:14,299
like bug, this is a problem, and they have to touch an image,

1136
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,801
every single thing that they type in any of the channels

1137
00:50:17,241 --> 00:50:19,142
on the Slay the Spire Discord would

1138
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,063
be funneled into a private channel called

1139
00:50:21,103 --> 00:50:21,804
Bugs and Feedback.

1140
00:50:22,814 --> 00:50:28,020
Um, this is a secret, don't tell anybody. But we also had some language parsing that

1141
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,525
determined if feedback was going to be useful or not, or they were just trolling. So there's

1142
00:50:32,566 --> 00:50:37,872
actually a section called low priority feedback and we look at that as a joke. Um, but the

1143
00:50:37,912 --> 00:50:41,636
normal feedback is actually not like 18,000. It's uh, usually about

1144
00:50:43,677 --> 00:50:45,237
About five to ten issues a day.

1145
00:50:45,698 --> 00:50:47,959
I guess in terms of triaging and prioritization,

1146
00:50:48,499 --> 00:50:51,261
that's a pretty heavy subject on its own.

1147
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,742
But I would say, you know, you just have to go with

1148
00:50:53,802 --> 00:50:57,624
what you feel is a easy to fix, right?

1149
00:50:57,664 --> 00:50:58,385
Low-hanging fruit.

1150
00:50:59,365 --> 00:51:01,246
Things that are easy to fix, we just fix immediately.

1151
00:51:01,806 --> 00:51:02,927
Because it's like, why not, right?

1152
00:51:02,967 --> 00:51:04,908
Like, this image is too high on this resolution.

1153
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:06,009
It's like, okay, we'll fix it.

1154
00:51:07,029 --> 00:51:08,850
Things that are hard to fix are a bit,

1155
00:51:09,491 --> 00:51:11,071
you know, you have to prioritize how long it takes

1156
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:11,772
versus how much.

1157
00:51:12,753 --> 00:51:14,014
how much it would be worth it, I would say.

1158
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,917
Bit of a hard question to answer, I apologize.

1159
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:18,259
Thank you.

1160
00:51:18,799 --> 00:51:23,284
Hi.

1161
00:51:24,605 --> 00:51:27,568
So how well would your marketing strategy work

1162
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:30,471
for a game with a more finite time span,

1163
00:51:30,491 --> 00:51:31,973
like a narrative game or a puzzle game?

1164
00:51:32,233 --> 00:51:33,154
What do you think you would change?

1165
00:51:34,018 --> 00:51:39,500
Hmm, that's true. I do definitely think that Slay the Spire, because of its roguelike nature,

1166
00:51:40,101 --> 00:51:43,602
kind of has huge implications with updates, right? Things are always changing when you

1167
00:51:43,622 --> 00:51:52,245
replay it. I'm really afraid to give bad advice on things I don't understand. It might be

1168
00:51:52,285 --> 00:51:55,946
best to ask somebody who's worked on an early access game that does have a finite ending.

1169
00:51:56,447 --> 00:52:01,468
I think maybe the folks who worked on Subnautica would be a good place to start.

1170
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:03,990
Cool, thanks.

1171
00:52:06,031 --> 00:52:09,112
How did you decide on the graphical aesthetics of the game?

1172
00:52:09,152 --> 00:52:11,953
Were you considering marketability at that point, or?

1173
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:13,153
That's a good question.

1174
00:52:14,314 --> 00:52:15,654
So I did the art for the game.

1175
00:52:16,014 --> 00:52:18,595
I did the bad art for the game and the okay art for the game

1176
00:52:18,755 --> 00:52:19,836
and there are some illustrations.

1177
00:52:21,136 --> 00:52:25,057
I guess in terms of art, what's most important for me

1178
00:52:25,137 --> 00:52:28,299
is just that it's readable, like contrast,

1179
00:52:28,759 --> 00:52:30,699
and those kind of principles are really important.

1180
00:52:31,475 --> 00:52:33,475
We kept the assets simple on purpose

1181
00:52:33,675 --> 00:52:35,116
because we didn't have a huge budget.

1182
00:52:35,776 --> 00:52:39,337
And so I guess to give an idea of the scope,

1183
00:52:39,797 --> 00:52:41,538
we have about 300 cards.

1184
00:52:42,298 --> 00:52:46,620
We have like 50 plus enemies, 100-ish relics, 50 events,

1185
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,200
and just a lot of content, right?

1186
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:50,321
And to just crank out that much content,

1187
00:52:50,461 --> 00:52:52,101
you have to have art that's very simple.

1188
00:52:52,222 --> 00:52:54,582
Not everything can be animated and fantastic

1189
00:52:55,022 --> 00:52:56,303
and have beautiful effects.

1190
00:52:56,463 --> 00:52:58,444
So I guess that's kind of where it started.

1191
00:53:00,124 --> 00:53:02,145
When it comes to theme or atmosphere or mood,

1192
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:04,006
I would say that's a much longer talk.

1193
00:53:04,086 --> 00:53:06,067
But I hope that answers your question.

1194
00:53:06,828 --> 00:53:07,108
Thanks.

1195
00:53:08,589 --> 00:53:10,110
Oh, yeah, it was kind of my question.

1196
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:11,770
Like, what really spawned the design?

1197
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:13,612
The initial design.

1198
00:53:13,692 --> 00:53:15,072
Yeah, the initial design and then

1199
00:53:15,112 --> 00:53:16,433
the narrative that grew around.

1200
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:16,793
I see.

1201
00:53:16,813 --> 00:53:21,576
I would definitely say that the narrative came from just like

1202
00:53:23,277 --> 00:53:24,917
It grew around the mechanics of the game.

1203
00:53:25,837 --> 00:53:27,558
It was definitely a mechanics-first game.

1204
00:53:28,558 --> 00:53:31,459
I think anyone who plays would kind of get that.

1205
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:33,359
It's a bit hacked in, but that's okay.

1206
00:53:33,659 --> 00:53:37,040
It's pretty fun, because we want you to start over and over,

1207
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,440
so there needs to be a lore around that.

1208
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:41,161
We wanted you to go up instead of down,

1209
00:53:41,381 --> 00:53:45,622
just to differentiate ourselves from dungeon crawlers.

1210
00:53:45,782 --> 00:53:49,303
We wanted a dungeon climber, a tower climber.

1211
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,262
The initial design itself, Anthony created the initial card game idea.

1212
00:53:56,643 --> 00:53:59,904
It was called Card Crawl, I think that was the original name of the game.

1213
00:54:00,885 --> 00:54:02,406
I don't know.

1214
00:54:02,686 --> 00:54:03,947
I mean, he played a lot of board games.

1215
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,168
He used to, you know, manage a board game shop.

1216
00:54:07,228 --> 00:54:08,949
And he runs a Netrunner community site.

1217
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:10,910
Who knows where his ideas come from.

1218
00:54:11,751 --> 00:54:11,971
Thanks.

1219
00:54:13,872 --> 00:54:19,635
Yeah, I was just actually curious about how you went about organizing the community translations

1220
00:54:19,916 --> 00:54:25,118
and how that transition was away from the more traditional sort of translation companies

1221
00:54:25,198 --> 00:54:28,380
and into the community run thing and how that works.

1222
00:54:29,161 --> 00:54:30,041
I see.

1223
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:33,023
So we kind of have a hacked way of doing community translations.

1224
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:34,644
It's actually a bit technical.

1225
00:54:34,664 --> 00:54:35,404
I actually don't...

1226
00:54:36,515 --> 00:54:37,857
recommend the way we do.

1227
00:54:38,657 --> 00:54:41,140
It is definitely good that it's community translations

1228
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:45,704
for all sorts of reasons like getting translations on time

1229
00:54:46,044 --> 00:54:46,544
for release.

1230
00:54:46,985 --> 00:54:49,227
However, there are definitely tools now

1231
00:54:49,447 --> 00:54:50,548
that weren't available before,

1232
00:54:51,009 --> 00:54:52,910
like websites where you can see all the strings

1233
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:54,211
and they're beautifully organized

1234
00:54:54,732 --> 00:54:55,633
and you write some stuff

1235
00:54:55,753 --> 00:54:57,494
and they'll probably export to beautiful.

1236
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:06,312
format. We didn't do that. We didn't have time because we had weekly updates to set up like an awesome community translation server.

1237
00:55:08,075 --> 00:55:09,577
So we sent out raw JSON files.

1238
00:55:10,629 --> 00:55:11,950
and those were returned.

1239
00:55:12,371 --> 00:55:13,972
We wrote some scripts to validate them.

1240
00:55:14,372 --> 00:55:16,634
We wrote some scripts that whenever we created new strings,

1241
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:18,335
they would be automatically populated

1242
00:55:18,455 --> 00:55:19,336
into the other languages,

1243
00:55:19,856 --> 00:55:22,559
and if a language either lost a translator

1244
00:55:22,579 --> 00:55:24,340
or was no longer translated or behind,

1245
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:29,024
they would just have English text for that content

1246
00:55:29,584 --> 00:55:30,545
until it was fixed, I guess.

1247
00:55:30,725 --> 00:55:33,727
Cool, and you'd have one or so people

1248
00:55:34,328 --> 00:55:36,930
who would volunteer and be your primary point of contact?

1249
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:38,611
I was curious about the human element.

1250
00:55:38,711 --> 00:55:39,332
Oh, it was me.

1251
00:55:39,912 --> 00:55:41,173
Oh, cool.

1252
00:55:41,874 --> 00:55:43,434
I guess there's a localization channel

1253
00:55:43,855 --> 00:55:45,656
called localization files, where I would be like,

1254
00:55:45,956 --> 00:55:47,597
these are the new files for this update,

1255
00:55:47,737 --> 00:55:49,418
and I would type it, and I would paste the file.

1256
00:55:49,978 --> 00:55:52,420
And then there was a different channel called localization discussions,

1257
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,721
and then there was a channel for every single language,

1258
00:55:55,482 --> 00:55:57,383
and I just asked them to ping me when I was ready.

1259
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:01,385
And so I guess anytime any translation wanted to be updated,

1260
00:56:01,805 --> 00:56:03,667
I was pinged, I downloaded the files,

1261
00:56:03,847 --> 00:56:05,588
and then I just updated them.

1262
00:56:06,248 --> 00:56:07,649
It was very manual. It was a lot of work.

1263
00:56:08,285 --> 00:56:10,286
I highly recommend that tool that I don't know exists.

1264
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:12,447
It probably exists.

1265
00:56:12,727 --> 00:56:13,268
We're GDC.

1266
00:56:13,288 --> 00:56:13,788
We'll find them.

1267
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:15,569
Thank you.

1268
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:16,390
Hi.

1269
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:20,092
I was just curious if through the iteration of early access

1270
00:56:20,152 --> 00:56:22,854
you ever saw any dips in your reviews,

1271
00:56:22,974 --> 00:56:24,935
like for example, when you introduced a new language

1272
00:56:24,995 --> 00:56:27,096
and it wasn't quite ready, anything like that.

1273
00:56:28,217 --> 00:56:30,278
I know you had strong reviews throughout most of it,

1274
00:56:30,338 --> 00:56:31,018
but if there's anything.

1275
00:56:31,038 --> 00:56:31,699
That's a good question.

1276
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:32,519
Our reviews?

1277
00:56:35,484 --> 00:56:36,924
did go up and down, not too much.

1278
00:56:37,305 --> 00:56:38,865
I think what's really important was that

1279
00:56:39,485 --> 00:56:42,086
we were able to maintain expectations the whole time.

1280
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,707
We were always explicit about what was broken.

1281
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,507
And we actually kept a lot of content hidden

1282
00:56:47,567 --> 00:56:49,528
from the main branch until it was 100% ready.

1283
00:56:50,228 --> 00:56:52,029
And that was kind of, I think,

1284
00:56:52,069 --> 00:56:55,510
our understanding between the players and ourselves.

1285
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:58,370
So it's always about expectations.

1286
00:56:58,550 --> 00:56:59,651
Like, you have to communicate.

1287
00:56:59,871 --> 00:57:01,871
Like, reviews are always about communication.

1288
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:06,514
And I guess if you don't fix something for a long time,

1289
00:57:07,455 --> 00:57:09,597
even if you communicate about it, it's not going to help.

1290
00:57:09,777 --> 00:57:11,958
So you do need to deliver on what you communicate.

1291
00:57:13,459 --> 00:57:14,440
Yes.

1292
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,162
So you said you had about two years of dev time

1293
00:57:17,202 --> 00:57:18,343
with basically no income.

1294
00:57:18,423 --> 00:57:21,165
And you were also at that time contracting some stuff,

1295
00:57:21,225 --> 00:57:22,506
like sound design, art design.

1296
00:57:23,346 --> 00:57:25,948
So I guess my question is, what were those additional costs?

1297
00:57:26,028 --> 00:57:27,770
And how were you budgeting and paying for them?

1298
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:28,830
I see.

1299
00:57:30,908 --> 00:57:33,589
I guess I'm very frugal and I don't spend much money.

1300
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:36,611
And I was just saving up money while I was working on Amazon

1301
00:57:37,071 --> 00:57:39,093
and it was just out of pocket between Anthony and I.

1302
00:57:40,954 --> 00:57:48,018
What the budget is, I think we did different types of models

1303
00:57:48,378 --> 00:57:50,619
in terms of like how much we were gonna pay contractors.

1304
00:57:51,953 --> 00:57:53,213
on a per contractor basis.

1305
00:57:53,893 --> 00:57:55,234
And how did you determine that number?

1306
00:57:55,454 --> 00:57:58,115
I don't know.

1307
00:57:58,275 --> 00:58:01,816
I think for each one we did a bunch of research in general.

1308
00:58:01,976 --> 00:58:09,558
We also actually, we used game dev classifieds on Reddit and Gamasutra, and then we just

1309
00:58:09,598 --> 00:58:11,518
got more people, and they all have different quotes.

1310
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:13,479
So I think it's up to...

1311
00:58:14,914 --> 00:58:17,935
Interviewing is a very interesting process, and it's very important.

1312
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:22,136
I don't think you should ever go for the first person that you get.

1313
00:58:22,356 --> 00:58:28,057
We went over several different people for each contractor, at least 10 illustrators

1314
00:58:28,097 --> 00:58:30,238
before we settled on the one we did.

1315
00:58:31,098 --> 00:58:31,298
Okay.

1316
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:32,498
Thanks.

1317
00:58:34,339 --> 00:58:38,880
Hi, how important do you think mod support was for your marketing and design?

1318
00:58:40,118 --> 00:58:43,179
So, mod support, we were initially going to make APIs

1319
00:58:43,819 --> 00:58:45,420
to allow people to mod the game easily.

1320
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:49,161
And then we found out that our game was written in Java,

1321
00:58:49,682 --> 00:58:51,822
and it turns out Java, you can just inject code

1322
00:58:52,222 --> 00:58:53,483
and mod the game however you want.

1323
00:58:54,363 --> 00:58:58,105
And so, modding kind of came in a very hacky way.

1324
00:58:58,965 --> 00:59:01,246
where a lot of people wanted to hack the game to add content

1325
00:59:01,606 --> 00:59:04,088
because maybe we weren't working hard enough, I'm not sure.

1326
00:59:04,668 --> 00:59:06,009
But it happened that way,

1327
00:59:06,269 --> 00:59:08,851
and then the stuff that came out of it was incredible.

1328
00:59:09,331 --> 00:59:11,412
And so we were like, this is modding now,

1329
00:59:11,693 --> 00:59:15,295
and we had a channel for almost a year and a half,

1330
00:59:15,555 --> 00:59:16,676
well I guess how long was the development?

1331
00:59:17,056 --> 00:59:19,777
A year and a few months, called Unsupported Modding.

1332
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:21,198
It was called Unsupported Modding,

1333
00:59:21,278 --> 00:59:22,999
and it was just in our official Discord channel.

1334
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,680
And they'd be pasting cool stuff,

1335
00:59:24,921 --> 00:59:25,821
and it wasn't officially...

1336
00:59:26,788 --> 00:59:28,330
like the way we were going to do mod support.

1337
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:32,693
But then we found out a way to get this code injection system

1338
00:59:33,193 --> 00:59:37,397
as like a Steam workshop method of getting mods into our game.

1339
00:59:37,977 --> 00:59:41,000
And so that officially became the official modding.

1340
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,622
So modding is really intense for Cytospire.

1341
00:59:44,763 --> 00:59:46,904
But if you like programming, also all of our code

1342
00:59:46,964 --> 00:59:47,665
is available.

1343
00:59:48,165 --> 00:59:51,208
It's not open source, but again, it's in Java.

1344
00:59:51,228 --> 00:59:52,128
You can just look at it.

1345
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:53,469
It's kind of weird.

1346
00:59:54,110 --> 00:59:54,730
It just happened.

1347
00:59:56,111 --> 00:59:56,231
So.

1348
00:59:57,177 --> 00:59:58,538
That's the story of our modding, I guess.

1349
00:59:59,038 --> 01:00:00,099
It's very important, I think.

1350
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:03,260
The mods are incredible, and it's been really good.

1351
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:04,561
Awesome, thanks.

1352
01:00:06,201 --> 01:00:09,163
Hey, since Slay the Spire is kind of a weird genre

1353
01:00:09,223 --> 01:00:10,663
mashup non-standard game,

1354
01:00:10,904 --> 01:00:12,484
what do you feel like was the best method

1355
01:00:12,524 --> 01:00:14,505
to get people to understand what your game was?

1356
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:18,790
That's a tough one.

1357
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,171
People still don't get the game when I try to explain it.

1358
01:00:21,651 --> 01:00:23,912
So I guess the only thing you can do is play it.

1359
01:00:23,932 --> 01:00:25,232
It's so streaming.

1360
01:00:25,252 --> 01:00:27,073
Do you think people watching the game?

1361
01:00:27,153 --> 01:00:29,394
I think it's definitely people watching streams.

1362
01:00:29,654 --> 01:00:31,255
I think that's definitely a new way that people

1363
01:00:31,275 --> 01:00:32,395
try to understand video games.

1364
01:00:33,576 --> 01:00:35,336
I generally don't try to start playing games

1365
01:00:35,356 --> 01:00:36,837
that are very complicated immediately.

1366
01:00:36,997 --> 01:00:37,257
One more.

1367
01:00:39,078 --> 01:00:41,398
Yeah, we never really improved.

1368
01:00:41,778 --> 01:00:43,539
how to sell the game, I would say.

1369
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,761
It's still really, really word of mouth.

1370
01:00:46,962 --> 01:00:48,524
But it's been doing well that way.

1371
01:00:48,724 --> 01:00:50,025
So I think we're just going to keep going that way.

1372
01:00:50,665 --> 01:00:50,885
Thanks.

1373
01:00:51,646 --> 01:00:52,006
One more.

1374
01:00:53,448 --> 01:00:55,850
In your sales data after early access,

1375
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:58,532
I saw that 60% was in China.

1376
01:00:59,293 --> 01:01:01,514
Is it still around that proportion?

1377
01:01:02,595 --> 01:01:05,137
You still have 60% of your sales in China?

1378
01:01:05,818 --> 01:01:06,879
Let me go back to the slide.

1379
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,961
I think it's about 20-something percent.

1380
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:11,071
Oh, sorry, 30%.

1381
01:01:11,231 --> 01:01:12,692
30-something, it is still that, yes.

1382
01:01:12,712 --> 01:01:13,673
That's very, very recent.

1383
01:01:14,334 --> 01:01:14,654
Oh, okay.

1384
01:01:14,894 --> 01:01:15,675
Do not ignore China.

1385
01:01:16,295 --> 01:01:17,196
There's a lot of people out there.

1386
01:01:17,216 --> 01:01:18,937
Okay.

1387
01:01:19,618 --> 01:01:19,938
Thank you.

1388
01:01:20,158 --> 01:01:21,519
Okay.

1389
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,500
Thanks for coming, everybody.
