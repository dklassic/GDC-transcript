00:00:01,567 --> 00:00:04,209
Hi everyone, welcome to the GDC Twitch channel.

2
00:00:04,249 --> 00:00:07,512
My name is Brian Francis, I am the invisible voice inside your head.

3
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:12,715
I am here as always checking out interesting games and talking with the folks who worked

4
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:13,016
on them.

5
00:00:14,637 --> 00:00:16,998
For those who are not familiar with the GDC Twitch channel, welcome.

6
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:17,619
This is the place.

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:19,380
We are tied to Game Developers Conference.

8
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:24,124
Like I said just a second ago, we try to take this opportunity to check out new and interesting

9
00:00:24,164 --> 00:00:29,227
games that are on the market, talk to the people who made them, and hopefully answer

10
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:30,548
some questions for folks in chat.

11
00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:32,292
who are curious about how they got made.

12
00:00:32,993 --> 00:00:34,477
In the lower left-hand corner of the screen,

13
00:00:34,597 --> 00:00:37,143
I am joined by Bert Beekman of Forgotten Empire.

14
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:38,806
Bert, how are you doing?

15
00:00:39,648 --> 00:00:41,573
Doing well, thanks, Brian. Thanks for having me.

16
00:00:42,012 --> 00:00:47,896
Awesome. And the game we are playing today, in case you haven't figured it out already, is Age of Empires II Definitive Edition.

17
00:00:48,936 --> 00:00:53,679
You might say, Bryant, this isn't a new game, this is a very old game. This is from 1999.

18
00:00:53,719 --> 00:01:03,524
And I would go, you're right, but earlier this year, the folks at Forgotten Empire and Microsoft worked together to put out a definitive edition for Age of Empires II.

19
00:01:04,085 --> 00:01:08,450
That includes content from the original game, content from the expansion Age of Conquerors,

20
00:01:08,531 --> 00:01:12,536
content from the HD edition, and a new expansion, I think, for this game?

21
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:13,877
That's what you mentioned earlier, Bert?

22
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:15,059
Yes, indeed.

23
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,005
Actually, I think there's five expansions currently packed into this one, alongside

24
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:20,766
the previous game.

25
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:21,447
So yeah, pretty exciting.

26
00:01:23,892 --> 00:01:28,355
Yeah, this makes it wild because it means Age of Empires 2 has sort of been in development

27
00:01:28,415 --> 00:01:32,497
for over two decades that means? 2019?

28
00:01:32,677 --> 00:01:33,858
2000? Yeah, like two.

29
00:01:33,938 --> 00:01:35,499
It's been 20 years of Age of Empires 2.

30
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,685
I picked the Saladin campaign to do a brief mission in because this is one of the first campaigns.

31
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:58,301
One of my favorite things about Age of Empires 2 as a game when I was a kid was this game got me through history class, it got me through a bunch of things that I would have otherwise thought were boring because I could play it in this game, Age of Empires.

32
00:01:58,782 --> 00:02:07,030
Um, Bert, I guess I should be asking, did you have a similar experience with Age of Empires back in the 90s, and how did you and your team get started on working with Microsoft on this?

33
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,553
Those two questions aren't linked. I'm sorry, but I'm just trying to make a segue happen.

34
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:22,244
Well, they are actually kind of linked, because a lot of the people on the team at Forgotten Empires are actually long-time fans of the game we played.

35
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:30,797
It applies to most of us as kids, we kind of grew up with it, and then we all kind of came back at the same time and formed this team.

36
00:02:31,987 --> 00:02:38,269
Now, how we kind of got involved with Age of Empires 2 is that we all started actually

37
00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:39,210
modding the game.

38
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,052
I think that was in 2011, 2012, around that time period.

39
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:48,533
And we started looking at Age of Empires 2 at the time.

40
00:02:48,673 --> 00:02:50,774
There was no active development on the game.

41
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,556
We kind of were like, okay, this is very interesting.

42
00:02:54,596 --> 00:02:58,097
There's all kinds of people who played the game when they were kids.

43
00:02:58,758 --> 00:03:03,188
Now they're coming back to this game and developing all kinds of modding tools.

44
00:03:04,077 --> 00:03:05,718
Hey, we want to make something cool with that.

45
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:08,659
So we started to look into what are the possibilities,

46
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:11,400
and there was one thing that was not done at that point,

47
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,281
which was adding new civilizations to the game.

48
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:17,122
So we, you know, fiddled around a bit,

49
00:03:17,182 --> 00:03:20,523
and then after some time we managed to add a new civilization to the game.

50
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:23,724
And we were like, okay, we can make a new expansion or something.

51
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:27,165
Adding new civilizations was never done at that point,

52
00:03:27,885 --> 00:03:30,086
as a mod. So yeah, we made a mod.

53
00:03:30,826 --> 00:03:34,369
It was all good, we brought it out, we put it on our website.

54
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:40,294
We put it on our website at Christmas Eve, which in hindsight was a terrible idea.

55
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:47,960
But at the time we thought, okay, that's great, because we're going to give the fans and people who are looking forward to this mod a nice Christmas present.

56
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:52,144
And we were like, yeah, we're going to have, let's say...

57
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:57,791
20,000 downloads in lifetime downloads, that would be great

58
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:02,113
The problem was with 20,000 downloads in I think the first hour

59
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:07,896
Website went down. It was Christmas Eve as I said before so yeah, nobody was around to help us there

60
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:10,898
so yeah all in all very very

61
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:18,682
weird and hectic launch of the mods, but eventually the mod got really popular and I think we have like a lifetime

62
00:04:19,482 --> 00:04:20,462
amount of downloads of

63
00:04:22,317 --> 00:04:28,408
1 million downloads I believe, which was way more than we ever dreamt of.

64
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:37,699
And at the same time, Microsoft was also looking at HD edition.

65
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:44,265
So we reached out to Microsoft and we were like, hey, you guys are showing interest again in the franchise, in the series.

66
00:04:44,805 --> 00:04:47,888
And we just made this mod that really did well.

67
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:52,012
Is there some way that we can cooperate? And we did.

68
00:04:53,193 --> 00:05:02,538
We started to work on more expansions for the HD edition at the time and then we started to work on the Definitive Edition as well.

69
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:04,959
So yeah, we really grew.

70
00:05:06,034 --> 00:05:12,195
Own each of empires and basically builds your under the swamp right on apologies for folks in jet. I

71
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:15,776
Have something of a cold so I'm trying to muscle through today's stream

72
00:05:16,957 --> 00:05:21,878
I was gonna try I'm trying to catch my coughing and keep it off mic, but apologies if I'm coughing in your ear

73
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:25,059
Um quick shout out for folks in chat. We are going to take questions

74
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:30,840
So if you're someone like aqua lute, telanus lurker sauce or robo borrow, um, we would love to hear from you

75
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,281
We'd love to know what questions you have

76
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:35,942
for Bert and if you'd like to know

77
00:05:36,882 --> 00:05:40,323
more about how this game got made. Bert, my first question for you then

78
00:05:41,543 --> 00:05:45,044
sort of talking about the transition, diving into that transition from modders to

79
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:48,585
full-time game developers

80
00:05:49,585 --> 00:05:52,886
how did that transition itself happen once you guys started talking to

81
00:05:52,926 --> 00:05:55,486
Microsoft like when did you and your friends sort of go from becoming

82
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:59,287
a group of modders to becoming like professional developers with what I

83
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:00,767
assume is an office and a studio

84
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:02,468
and what was that process like

85
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:06,570
It's been a very gradual process.

86
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,993
Because we have been working on those expansions for quite some time,

87
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:14,055
it really allowed us to grow slowly and at our own pace.

88
00:06:14,135 --> 00:06:18,138
So it was not like, OK, we're now hired, we now need to start a studio,

89
00:06:18,158 --> 00:06:22,461
we need to get people together, all in a matter of months or weeks.

90
00:06:22,561 --> 00:06:23,822
No, we literally have years.

91
00:06:24,702 --> 00:06:29,946
to slowly build up and that was actually really good because we uh Age of Empires is a slow game

92
00:06:29,986 --> 00:06:35,350
but we as a studio also like to take it at a relatively easy going in a way like we don't

93
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,853
want to take crazy risks or do crazy things but you know take it take it gently and that really

94
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:45,817
allowed us to make intelligent decisions and in growing as a studio. Now the thing is we were

95
00:06:45,857 --> 00:06:46,818
actually a virtual studio

96
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:57,225
We do have some smaller local presences, but overall most of the people are working from home or working from shared offices.

97
00:06:57,325 --> 00:07:01,208
So that's kind of how we're still doing it at this point.

98
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:06,592
Oh nice, I should have. And then it's actually Lurkersauce brought that up in chat.

99
00:07:07,613 --> 00:07:12,616
Right on, well just to talk about diving into the Definitive Edition, you already worked on an HD edition.

100
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:17,679
And obviously I know that there's a definitive edition for Age of Empires I and Age of Empires II.

101
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:21,700
What did you see as the temples for a definitive edition?

102
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:23,321
What it would need to entail?

103
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:28,743
What were the project goals of that that separated it from the prior HD edition you've done?

104
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:34,802
So back in the day if you look at the HD edition the main goal of that was okay

105
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:39,924
Let's bring Age of Empires 2 back to the players. There were a lot of people who have not played

106
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:44,065
I mean who still has a CD player in their laptop, for example

107
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:48,067
Those are all things that you know people like H2

108
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:51,928
But they had no idea how to play it and that was kind of the goal of the HD edition

109
00:07:52,768 --> 00:07:53,788
To bring it back to the players

110
00:07:54,869 --> 00:08:06,073
And it kind of grew on that, like we brought more content because there was clearly a very strong demand from the community, like, hey, we want more, H2, we definitely want more.

111
00:08:07,114 --> 00:08:14,537
But then when the definitive editions were made, it was more than, okay, let's just bring back H2, let's...

112
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:21,915
Actually, the whole project goal from within Microsoft and from us as well was,

113
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:25,378
okay, we need to make the best H2 possible.

114
00:08:25,898 --> 00:08:27,159
That was the intent here.

115
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,241
So it was a very, very different approach.

116
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:31,863
Instead of just bringing it back, it was like, okay,

117
00:08:31,883 --> 00:08:37,008
let's make sure that everything we have at this point is further improved

118
00:08:37,188 --> 00:08:39,650
and is the best possible thing that we can make.

119
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:47,313
That's really the big difference and it can kind of manifest itself in many ways as well.

120
00:08:48,574 --> 00:08:53,476
If you look at the graphics, if you put them side by side, you can really see, okay, this

121
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:56,217
was the 90s and this is no longer the 90s.

122
00:08:58,098 --> 00:09:04,700
You just see it on screen here as well, like buildings now beautifully collapse and crumbling

123
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,522
down or we have the, how do you call that, the...

124
00:09:09,642 --> 00:09:12,923
smoke that comes out of the barrel of the cannon as it fires a cannonball.

125
00:09:13,223 --> 00:09:16,524
Those are all like little details that were not in the original game.

126
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:20,245
And that really, yeah, make it look a lot prettier.

127
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:24,767
With that said, like literally every asset in the game has been remade.

128
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:31,208
Which was not the case in the HD edition. In the HD edition all the graphics were the original graphics.

129
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:39,225
But the resolution was just scaled up so your viewport was like bigger, larger, but it was still the same sprites.

130
00:09:39,385 --> 00:09:41,867
And now you have much higher quality sprites as well.

131
00:09:42,987 --> 00:09:44,589
Man, the...

132
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,373
What was the process of remaking an entire game's worth of assets for you and your team?

133
00:09:51,413 --> 00:09:53,775
Especially for like a remote work from home team.

134
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:55,036
Like, I assume...

135
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:59,899
I assume for not a large amount of people that was a lot of work.

136
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:07,671
Yes, so this is where we also had the chance to work together with other studios.

137
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:11,575
The art oversight and art direction, that's something that we all did in-house,

138
00:10:11,635 --> 00:10:15,719
that was all done by F.E., in cooperation with Microsoft,

139
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:23,066
but a lot of the assets work was luckily done by a partner studio that helped us out.

140
00:10:23,627 --> 00:10:27,370
Now, with that set, it was still a crazy amount of work.

141
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,912
When we started this and we made the list of assets that we actually had to remake,

142
00:10:30,932 --> 00:10:34,855
it was like, okay, this is not just one game we're remaking, this is six games worth of

143
00:10:34,915 --> 00:10:38,518
assets that we're making, which is an insane amount.

144
00:10:39,979 --> 00:10:43,042
And it also took ages to actually review all those.

145
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:47,125
And also, actually, we didn't have any of the original assets.

146
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:48,066
Those were all lost.

147
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,508
So literally, we had no choice but to make everything from scratch.

148
00:10:52,939 --> 00:10:54,380
But other than that it was just...

149
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:58,643
Yeah, two things that were on our side.

150
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:04,346
One thing was definitely that we have the original art.

151
00:11:04,827 --> 00:11:07,308
And one of the things that we really wanted to stick to was...

152
00:11:08,109 --> 00:11:13,872
Okay, if people have been recognizing this specific unit as being a camel,

153
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:15,533
as you can see on the screen now,

154
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:16,514
these camels,

155
00:11:17,034 --> 00:11:21,056
we want to make sure that somebody still recognizes that unit as a camel 20 years later.

156
00:11:21,617 --> 00:11:24,258
So we didn't really have to go around and redesign all of this.

157
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:26,080
It was more like, okay, we kind of have it here.

158
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,862
It might only be 100 pixels high.

159
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:32,904
Now it's like, I don't know, four times the fidelity.

160
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:36,627
We need to imagine what all those pixels in between look like.

161
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:40,989
But as an overall view, you kind of know what units are going to look like.

162
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,251
And that really helped in speeding up that process.

163
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:47,534
It helped us, you know, stick to the original design

164
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:49,675
and, yeah, try to just bring that back.

165
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,181
as good as possible.

166
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:52,562
Right on, um...

167
00:11:53,342 --> 00:11:54,223
Oh no, go on, go on.

168
00:11:54,963 --> 00:11:57,825
No, I actually forgot my train of thought there, so sorry.

169
00:11:58,505 --> 00:12:00,287
It's okay, um, yeah, um...

170
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:04,469
Uh, from that point on, moving on from the individual assets,

171
00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:05,870
I guess my next question would be...

172
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:05,930
Um...

173
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,173
Uh, it would be foolish of me to say that you could just

174
00:12:10,453 --> 00:12:12,274
copy and paste the original code from the game,

175
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:15,316
the original, like, programming and logic, to make it work one-to-one.

176
00:12:15,876 --> 00:12:20,923
in your new software. What was the process for

177
00:12:21,444 --> 00:12:24,247
rebuilding the scripting and the sort of

178
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:27,532
like the AI, like a lot of the logic that made Age of Empires

179
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:28,333
what it was?

180
00:12:30,836 --> 00:12:34,739
Well, I don't know how technical I can get here, but there were a few challenges here.

181
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:39,583
So we did have the code, we did have the original code to work from and luckily because of HD

182
00:12:39,903 --> 00:12:43,425
we could also start from HD, which was set up more recently.

183
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:52,092
However, the biggest issue, and that was also an issue that HD actually had issues with,

184
00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:58,116
is that if you take a game that was compiled back in the 90s and now you take it and recompile

185
00:12:58,156 --> 00:12:59,537
it again with late settings.

186
00:13:00,452 --> 00:13:03,694
not everything will be exactly the same.

187
00:13:05,595 --> 00:13:09,917
There were a lot of places where we noticed that

188
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:15,059
the way you compile the game kind of defines like behavior,

189
00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:18,601
like, okay, there's an unfinancialized variable,

190
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:21,382
how does the compiler handle with that, deal with that?

191
00:13:22,203 --> 00:13:25,144
And the reason I'm saying that is because

192
00:13:25,164 --> 00:13:27,665
all of a sudden, you recompile the game,

193
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:28,726
you make not a single change.

194
00:13:33,183 --> 00:13:36,645
accountable and that was especially visible in for example pathfinding like

195
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:41,048
you can take the pathfinding from 1999 just compile the code again with nothing

196
00:13:41,068 --> 00:13:45,010
new to it and the pathfinding is slightly different and especially for you know you

197
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:51,814
have a very big passion community still for HTML-2 they will definitely

198
00:13:51,854 --> 00:13:55,076
notice that like hey this is different what are you guys doing like yeah

199
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:59,739
nothing yet but it's still different yeah so then you need to go back in

200
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,139
there and look at the pathfinding code

201
00:14:03,121 --> 00:14:08,964
make it better, which we also did. We also went in the pathfinding and went a bit more

202
00:14:09,085 --> 00:14:14,608
thorough. But yeah, for engineering it was also not just, okay, it's different right

203
00:14:14,648 --> 00:14:20,272
from the bat, but also a lot of things that were true in 90s coding are no longer true

204
00:14:20,312 --> 00:14:20,912
in 2020 or 2019 coding.

205
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:26,654
Coding standards have changed, back practices have changed.

206
00:14:27,094 --> 00:14:30,518
What is now efficient for hardware might not be efficient anymore.

207
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:33,520
So yeah, it's not like you were handed a game that's...

208
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:38,425
I mean, it still works, but the kind of intricacies and efficiencies from...

209
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:40,387
They no longer work.

210
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:42,870
Or are no longer true.

211
00:14:43,818 --> 00:14:52,523
Right on. Going to chat real quick. We got folks like Brazucano3000 commenting that we need unique units for each civ. That sounds like a lot of work.

212
00:14:53,444 --> 00:15:02,509
That sounds like a ton of work. I don't know. I like games like Warcraft that have unique units for every civ, but they still like...

213
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,723
They keep things analogous. I like how Age of Empires does it too. I like that there's all the basic units and then the unique units.

214
00:15:10,724 --> 00:15:17,508
There's also a bit of an issue there. We definitely talked about it. But there's two big things to consider there.

215
00:15:17,588 --> 00:15:25,973
One thing is, of course, that we have now 11 different architecture sets. 35 civilizations, but 11 architecture sets.

216
00:15:26,034 --> 00:15:29,496
Let's assume that we're not going per civ, but per architecture sets.

217
00:15:30,216 --> 00:15:34,097
then still all of a sudden you have 10 times as many units that you need to recognize,

218
00:15:34,957 --> 00:15:36,698
which makes things a lot more complicated.

219
00:15:36,818 --> 00:15:42,520
One of the beauties of Age of Empires 2 is that you see the units and you know what it is.

220
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,660
That's very, very important in RTS games.

221
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:48,682
I can't quite imagine if you have all of a sudden 10 times the amount of units.

222
00:15:48,722 --> 00:15:52,883
It's much, much harder to do that, let alone with 35 different sets of units.

223
00:15:54,323 --> 00:15:56,064
Not to mention, it's a lot more assets.

224
00:15:57,044 --> 00:16:01,245
and that will take a lot more memory space and hard disk space.

225
00:16:02,006 --> 00:16:05,106
Because it's one of those things as well, this game is still 2D.

226
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:09,908
A lot of people think that it's actually 3D now, but it's still 2D sprites.

227
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:13,809
Because we really wanted to keep that old feel,

228
00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:19,030
but at the same time that's also very very heavy on computers.

229
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:22,811
Like, okay, it's a lot of space that is taken on your hard disk

230
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:25,072
for all those sprites, all those facets.

231
00:16:25,553 --> 00:16:30,732
So yeah, there's a few considerations before we can look at individual unit skins.

232
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:38,494
Right on. Moving on, Lurker Sauce has some interesting insight.

233
00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:44,697
The initial size of Age of Empires 2 DE and Beta was 60 gigabytes.

234
00:16:44,717 --> 00:16:48,158
You managed to half that in compression and split the 4K support in DLC.

235
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,340
That's true. I'm sorry we're not playing with the 4K support today.

236
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:56,402
My machine is bugged. It can do the best it can.

237
00:16:56,442 --> 00:16:58,523
I wanted to make sure we had the best image quality for the stream.

238
00:16:59,503 --> 00:17:01,344
Because unfortunately at 4K we might have had some trouble.

239
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:12,251
But yeah, what was your process for and decision making process for including that 4K support

240
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:18,315
and how did you work to the point of including it as DLC instead of making it a main feature

241
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:18,675
of the game?

242
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:21,557
That's a really interesting question actually.

243
00:17:21,657 --> 00:17:26,601
So when we started working on this, all the ideas was okay.

244
00:17:27,442 --> 00:17:32,185
Age of Empires 2 has been going on for 20 years. We want to make sure it can go on for another 20 years.

245
00:17:32,905 --> 00:17:35,166
And then you just have to add 4k graphics.

246
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:42,250
There is, I mean at this point, I think if you look at Steam hardware, a lot of people are on HD or tiny above that.

247
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:46,372
But it is slightly moving higher and that will always keep on happening.

248
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:53,436
So in 20 years, maybe 4k will be tiny and then you want 4k graphics, especially in the 2D environment.

249
00:17:53,896 --> 00:17:55,637
And so it just won't be readable.

250
00:17:56,397 --> 00:18:02,439
But indeed, as the chat mentioned as well, this came with a large, like an explosion

251
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,121
in data size, asset size on your hard disk drive.

252
00:18:08,482 --> 00:18:15,644
And at some point in the AOT, AOT2DE beta was 60 gigabytes.

253
00:18:16,104 --> 00:18:20,406
And then we saw, okay, with 60 gigabytes a lot of people won't be able to run that, which

254
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,006
is not the...

255
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:29,295
intent at all. We want people to play the game and have as wide a range of computers

256
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:33,300
they can play as possible. And at that point, we're like, okay, we need to look further

257
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,785
into compression. And I think we went down to, I would say, 30 gigabytes. So if you have

258
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:42,170
everything installed, I think you're about 30 large at this point.

259
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:49,512
And as the chat also just mentioned, we once were at the point where we had 120 gigabytes

260
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:57,193
of data size just in the, yeah, I think it was a pre-beta, but that was really, really

261
00:18:57,253 --> 00:18:58,094
big at that time.

262
00:18:58,274 --> 00:19:03,255
And then at that point we really noticed, okay, this is larger than most AAA game coming

263
00:19:03,315 --> 00:19:03,675
out today.

264
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:05,855
We really need to go hard.

265
00:19:06,555 --> 00:19:07,996
and get that size down.

266
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:10,177
And we did. At this point,

267
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:13,338
you can say, okay, I'm just playing with HD graphics.

268
00:19:14,298 --> 00:19:17,099
And then, yeah, it's much, much smaller.

269
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,260
I would have to check the min spec on how small it exactly is, but

270
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,521
yeah, we're in a much better position at this point.

271
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,982
Right on. As you can see in the stream,

272
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:30,503
folks, just to do, I was about to go through more campaign missions, and I remembered

273
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:34,365
most of my time in Age of Empires 2 was spent just playing random

274
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:42,704
Random games, usually 8 player games on islands where I would usually just build a fortified

275
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:50,711
island and use cheat codes to win the game because I was just a kid and didn't know how

276
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,672
to play this game very well.

277
00:19:53,033 --> 00:19:58,018
But I decided for the purposes of our stream to just boot up a classic game and see how

278
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:00,120
it plays out in the new HD edition.

279
00:20:00,649 --> 00:20:09,840
Um, uh, Bert, um, we're gonna move on to my, uh, next question, which has to do with the new factions and sort of the new historical bacon thing.

280
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:19,091
One of the coolest things about Age of Empires, um, Age of Empires 2 for me as a kid was that it helped me learn more about civilizations that they don't teach you about in the American school system.

281
00:20:20,933 --> 00:20:26,476
I don't think you really get a lot of perspective on, say, Saladin and his campaign until you're

282
00:20:26,496 --> 00:20:33,580
in high school, but here I was at age 11 in middle elementary school getting to learn

283
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,282
sort of about perspectives and people that I had never met before.

284
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:39,624
What was your team's philosophy for building out the new factions?

285
00:20:40,164 --> 00:20:44,367
Not just from a fun standpoint, but from kind of the historical standpoint that the series

286
00:20:44,407 --> 00:20:44,827
is known for.

287
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:51,265
Well, that's a massive question. I can probably fill a whole stream just answering that.

288
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:54,706
But it's really interesting, actually.

289
00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:58,467
So, SIF design and how we kind of get to those SIFs and how we approach it,

290
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:01,488
there's not really like a set process.

291
00:21:02,848 --> 00:21:08,290
When we start working on expansion, and that we learned from all of our earlier expansions, actually,

292
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,732
is we try to approach things regionally.

293
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:16,494
I think we first did that with the African Kingdoms,

294
00:21:16,554 --> 00:21:18,655
where we kind of focused on African history,

295
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:20,896
and we kind of went to Southeast Asian history,

296
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:22,577
and then now for the E edition we're like,

297
00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:25,198
okay, what region is really interesting

298
00:21:25,258 --> 00:21:26,259
and we haven't covered yet?

299
00:21:26,439 --> 00:21:29,680
And then we went to Eastern Europe and Central Asia.

300
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,102
So that's kind of the theme for the civs in this one.

301
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:33,842
Now,

302
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:42,617
At that point, you're like, okay, what civs from that region are interesting for Age of Empires?

303
00:21:43,878 --> 00:21:46,662
And that's always the most difficult discussion to have.

304
00:21:48,357 --> 00:22:03,763
At the beginning it's always easy. You can say, okay, medieval civilization, British, Chinese, and everybody kind of knows those and everybody is like, okay, that's quintessentially medieval stuff and everybody can name something about those civilizations.

305
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:09,965
But as soon as you get a bit more obscure, the questions become a bit harder, like, okay, what exactly sets that apart?

306
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:13,146
And then you look at a few things that make it really interesting.

307
00:22:13,246 --> 00:22:15,047
For example, we have the Tatars in the game.

308
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:19,849
And if we think about the Tatars, we're like, okay, we have the story of Tamerlane.

309
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,391
That's a super interesting story to tell.

310
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:28,354
So we're like, okay, even if the Tatars, I'm not saying they were not interesting, but

311
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:34,637
even if the Tatars were not as known as, for example, the Chinese or the British, the story

312
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:39,320
that we can tell in the campaigns is so interesting that we absolutely want those guys in.

313
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,842
So that's one thing, but it can also be something else.

314
00:22:44,903 --> 00:22:50,927
For example, the Chinese, this is again an older sif with an example, you can say,

315
00:22:50,947 --> 00:22:55,009
okay, the Chinese have the chukou nu, their repeated crossbow,

316
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:00,873
that's a very interesting weapon, and that's something that you absolutely want to have in the game.

317
00:23:02,054 --> 00:23:06,077
Always like, okay, what's an interesting facets of a civilization?

318
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:10,040
And at that point you kind of, you know, build around that.

319
00:23:12,021 --> 00:23:17,765
So it's not just one thing that makes a disciple, makes an interesting, but always like, yeah, what?

320
00:23:19,105 --> 00:23:23,906
What are a few interesting things that we can start on and then we start researching, we start building?

321
00:23:25,046 --> 00:23:30,807
The researching bit is always very interesting because we try to look at it from various perspectives.

322
00:23:32,088 --> 00:23:37,009
That's history. History is always written from a certain perspective.

323
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:43,770
It's always in a certain look. I can't find the exact words in English.

324
00:23:47,107 --> 00:23:54,990
We try to keep it, how should I say it, as open-minded as possible.

325
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:01,892
For example, when we were working on the Tatars, we reached out to some universities from the region.

326
00:24:05,896 --> 00:24:09,398
in the sense of the Middle Ages, that country is no longer around.

327
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:13,940
So we were looking for universities in the regions, reached out to them,

328
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,843
read research papers from PhD students as well, went to a lot of libraries.

329
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:22,165
It's a lot of good old-fashioned research in there, to be honest.

330
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:25,447
Which is actually good fun.

331
00:24:27,068 --> 00:24:37,473
I mean, you can start from Wikipedia, but after that you really need to go to get down and dirty with actual proper research that you can find all over the world.

332
00:24:38,874 --> 00:24:42,095
And that's kind of how we can fine-tune those sys further.

333
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:48,258
Now, at that point, once we have a lot of information to work from,

334
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,002
At that point it's more like, okay, we're still making a video game here.

335
00:24:54,162 --> 00:24:59,847
We're not just making a history book, because that's obvious.

336
00:24:59,907 --> 00:25:02,809
We're making a video game for people to enjoy.

337
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:07,853
And that's kind of where you have to say, okay, we need to make decisions.

338
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:12,457
For example, we have the Kumans that we just added to the game.

339
00:25:13,218 --> 00:25:18,722
The Kumans, they got extinct before most of the civilization nature vampires were around.

340
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:27,296
Does that mean that this civilization needs to, you know, stop being relevant as you advance through the game?

341
00:25:28,097 --> 00:25:30,979
Yeah, probably not, because then the game will be completely unbalanced.

342
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,604
So this is kind of where you also need to weigh gameplay versus history at that point.

343
00:25:38,164 --> 00:25:42,828
Man, how did it feel to sort of walk in the footsteps of the original Age of Empires devs,

344
00:25:43,328 --> 00:25:46,331
in terms of building and adding new factions, like you're sort of sitting there going...

345
00:25:46,911 --> 00:25:50,155
you know, we're embarking on the same mission that they did in

346
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:52,598
the 1990s. But we're doing it, you know, with the tools

347
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:55,341
available to us, you know, and a much faster internet for one.

348
00:25:56,162 --> 00:25:56,422
Yes.

349
00:25:58,324 --> 00:25:59,766
In the modern day.

350
00:26:00,948 --> 00:26:07,011
It was interesting because I've read some interviews about them and how they kind of went around it.

351
00:26:07,131 --> 00:26:13,134
And I can't imagine how they would have to go to like more obscure sips.

352
00:26:13,234 --> 00:26:18,156
Because sometimes it was like, okay, we had the children's books that we worked from,

353
00:26:18,356 --> 00:26:23,539
or we, you know, we had some articles from magazines and we cut those out,

354
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:25,200
and that was kind of a reference art.

355
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,801
Those are things that I wrote, sorry, that I read.

356
00:26:28,721 --> 00:26:30,543
in all terms to reuse from Ensemble Studios.

357
00:26:31,183 --> 00:26:33,625
And now with the wealth of information that we have on the Internet

358
00:26:33,645 --> 00:26:36,147
and the ability to just say like, okay, I'm gonna, you know,

359
00:26:36,247 --> 00:26:38,828
send an email to the University of Istanbul

360
00:26:39,209 --> 00:26:41,971
to get some research on Central Asian history.

361
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:45,753
That is something that we now can do and they could not.

362
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:50,817
So in a way, I really appreciate the work that they did back in the day

363
00:26:50,837 --> 00:26:54,800
in, you know, researching that with the tools that they had available.

364
00:26:56,083 --> 00:27:00,128
right on on king thirty five hundred israeli question on this is still space

365
00:27:00,188 --> 00:27:03,633
in human history you can tell in a new campaigns receipts

366
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:12,178
At this point we added 35 civilizations to the game, which is a crazy amount.

367
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,820
There is still more, there is still more.

368
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,642
Is that gonna come to Age of Empires? I don't know.

369
00:27:18,822 --> 00:27:23,785
We've been saying for a while now that for civilizations we're probably good.

370
00:27:24,826 --> 00:27:27,007
We don't really expect to add more civilizations.

371
00:27:27,347 --> 00:27:30,229
Never say never, but we don't really expect it at this point.

372
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:34,892
But for campaigns, yeah, there's loads of stories to tell.

373
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:40,356
We actually went through the campaigns, all of them actually.

374
00:27:40,977 --> 00:27:44,980
We kind of remade and repolished them where necessary.

375
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,601
I mean, you just played the Saldin mission.

376
00:27:47,922 --> 00:27:52,825
That one is still very, very familiar to the old Saldin, but there were missions that we

377
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:53,526
completely...

378
00:27:53,986 --> 00:28:00,730
Hoover vault or completely replaced with new ones. And then we noticed like, okay, we have

379
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:06,994
Aztecs and we're talking and we're telling stories about the Franks, John the Park and William Walton

380
00:28:07,074 --> 00:28:12,078
and there's so many stories that we told, but then we noticed, oh, we never really told them stories

381
00:28:12,118 --> 00:28:16,881
about the Vikings or the Chinese or the Japanese. It's like, yeah, those are...

382
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:21,404
have a very rich history and a lot of interesting stories to tell.

383
00:28:21,824 --> 00:28:26,428
But yeah, they're not told yet in the Vampires 2 at least.

384
00:28:27,449 --> 00:28:27,889
Right on.

385
00:28:30,011 --> 00:28:31,152
Moving on to that point.

386
00:28:33,974 --> 00:28:37,556
Okay, let me dive into my question basket here for a second.

387
00:28:41,891 --> 00:28:46,194
Let's briefly talk then about working with Microsoft.

388
00:28:46,214 --> 00:28:50,818
You mentioned earlier that the company was able to provide a lot of QA and localization

389
00:28:50,838 --> 00:28:52,699
support when you checked in with them in Seattle.

390
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,624
What was it like as a small to mid-sized team working with a larger company that in this

391
00:28:58,664 --> 00:29:00,145
case owned VIP, obviously?

392
00:29:00,165 --> 00:29:04,589
How did you build a working relationship with them and what do you think other developers

393
00:29:04,629 --> 00:29:05,529
should know about when...

394
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:11,932
about opportunities like this to work with companies that are open to handing their IP over to you?

395
00:29:14,773 --> 00:29:21,555
Well, where to start? So I have to say we've gone through quite a few

396
00:29:21,575 --> 00:29:24,976
corporations with Microsoft over the years. We started with BlinkBank Mots

397
00:29:26,017 --> 00:29:28,878
and importing that to be an official product.

398
00:29:29,658 --> 00:29:32,359
And at that point, HMVirus was still...

399
00:29:33,431 --> 00:29:39,232
At that point, it didn't have that much attention internally at Microsoft,

400
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:46,394
because there was nothing in Age of Empires for quite a few years at that point.

401
00:29:47,474 --> 00:29:49,895
So there was no massive team supporting it.

402
00:29:50,695 --> 00:29:52,756
But these things have really changed lately.

403
00:29:53,436 --> 00:29:58,317
If you look at, well, they just opened a new studio just to support Age of Empires.

404
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:05,388
So those are things that really show, okay, now you're working with a bigger group.

405
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:12,855
But really, the best advice I think I could give is like, be humble.

406
00:30:13,636 --> 00:30:19,181
Like, listen and look around. They're a big company. Microsoft has been around for ages.

407
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:24,466
We're very lucky to be supported by a team that has been around for quite some time as well.

408
00:30:27,655 --> 00:30:30,457
we have people who work on AI, like so many games,

409
00:30:31,237 --> 00:30:32,578
also RTS games in the past.

410
00:30:32,978 --> 00:30:33,999
And that really, really helps.

411
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:35,680
Like these guys know what they're doing.

412
00:30:36,781 --> 00:30:39,162
And being with them, like, okay,

413
00:30:39,242 --> 00:30:41,584
we might know the game better working on it,

414
00:30:41,944 --> 00:30:43,625
but they know so many other things.

415
00:30:44,245 --> 00:30:46,126
And it's more about like, you know,

416
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:48,147
getting the best from each other.

417
00:30:49,388 --> 00:30:52,690
And that's also what's good about our working relationship

418
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:53,751
with Microsoft at the moment.

419
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:55,112
They absolutely recognize, okay,

420
00:30:55,192 --> 00:30:56,833
you guys really know Age of Empires.

421
00:30:57,407 --> 00:31:04,694
please do your thing. We will be supporting you guys with all the experience that we have to

422
00:31:04,794 --> 00:31:07,396
offer and it's a very nice working relationship in that sense.

423
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:17,572
Right on. I'm going to give a quick shout out for the bottom of the hour. We are going to be talking with Bert for about another 30 minutes.

424
00:31:18,613 --> 00:31:22,176
We would love to take your questions from chat. We've heard from folks like Lurker Sauce and King3500.

425
00:31:22,196 --> 00:31:29,483
But if you have questions about the making of Age of Empire 2 Definitive Edition, we would love to ask them on your behalf.

426
00:31:29,503 --> 00:31:31,765
Excuse me just a second.

427
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:38,855
Sorry, dealing with the cold and trying to stream video games is very difficult.

428
00:31:39,535 --> 00:31:46,658
Um, uh, Bert, um, let's talk about, I guess, like, you mentioned yourself, um, as a team

429
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:51,180
of modders, you know, you're sort of lucky to get to come together and make content for

430
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,981
a game that, um...

431
00:31:53,921 --> 00:31:59,305
was popular 20 years ago and now you get to revitalize it and refresh it for the same community and keep it alive today.

432
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:05,711
What has been your team's approach to continuing that mod support for other users?

433
00:32:05,731 --> 00:32:10,394
Because obviously Age of Empires still has a really good built-in modding tool,

434
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:12,576
it has an online mod community.

435
00:32:12,636 --> 00:32:18,481
What has been your approach in that respect to letting people take the Age of Empires tools and go buck wild with them?

436
00:32:20,203 --> 00:32:26,006
Alright, so yeah, there's a lot and the thing is like the modding community just doesn't stop, right?

437
00:32:26,226 --> 00:32:26,746
Yeah.

438
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:31,469
Even as we're talking, there's probably new stuff in development and new things going on.

439
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:39,353
And that was also a challenge when we made the Definitive Edition, like, okay, the mods tools that were being constantly developed

440
00:32:39,713 --> 00:32:43,235
were actually developed for the old game and at the same time we were making the Definitive Edition

441
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:49,358
and like every month we were like, okay, this new modding tool came out or this thing just came from the community.

442
00:32:50,139 --> 00:32:56,264
How do we can, how can we ensure that this gets, you know, finds its way to the E?

443
00:32:57,526 --> 00:33:04,592
And that is also more of an ongoing story actually, because at this point Microsoft has also said like,

444
00:33:04,652 --> 00:33:08,736
hey, we're not done with Age of Empires 2, like, we've just released the game,

445
00:33:09,136 --> 00:33:11,498
but now we're going to support it for quite some time.

446
00:33:12,739 --> 00:33:18,940
because we definitely noticed that there's so many people playing, the game is so big,

447
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,041
you can support this for quite some time if you want to.

448
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,882
So that's kind of what we're doing now.

449
00:33:25,362 --> 00:33:30,023
In modding tools, we're not there yet. We're still working on it, actually.

450
00:33:30,043 --> 00:33:32,864
We actually have a patch coming out next week.

451
00:33:32,884 --> 00:33:37,745
I don't think we have shared the exact date yet, but next week we have a very big patch coming out.

452
00:33:38,508 --> 00:33:41,743
where we will be focusing more on fixes for the audio molding, for example.

453
00:33:42,363 --> 00:33:47,306
So there was a lot of people in the community trying around with all their mods,

454
00:33:47,366 --> 00:33:49,907
and they were like, okay, this can be better, this can be improved.

455
00:33:50,888 --> 00:33:53,389
And we took that advice and we implemented that.

456
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:57,471
So that's kind of what we're trying to do at this point,

457
00:33:57,592 --> 00:33:59,292
because we recognize it as well.

458
00:34:00,013 --> 00:34:01,594
We come from the modding community,

459
00:34:02,394 --> 00:34:08,418
and we want to make sure that that spirit stays around as much as possible.

460
00:34:09,373 --> 00:34:13,417
As time allows, we will continue doing that and providing tools.

461
00:34:14,217 --> 00:34:20,943
But with that said, when we ship the game, we already included some of our dev tools into the package.

462
00:34:21,504 --> 00:34:27,188
So people who really want to get nitty-gritty with things, they can just go to the tools folder and look around there.

463
00:34:27,509 --> 00:34:34,495
And if they have any questions about that, just ask in the Discord or on the forums and I'm quite sure somebody will get to it.

464
00:34:35,312 --> 00:34:40,756
Right on, Lurker Sauce was actually just asking about the audio support, audio mod support,

465
00:34:40,896 --> 00:34:46,540
and just to follow up on their question for them, is it MP3 or WAV support for that tool?

466
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:55,396
It's actually WEM. It's a specific format. We did make the whole process a bit easier.

467
00:34:56,456 --> 00:35:01,057
I'm judging from his questions, it seems like he has been diving into that quite a bit.

468
00:35:01,077 --> 00:35:07,058
He definitely read the modding guide there, but that guide will be a lot more relevant once patch comes out next week.

469
00:35:07,418 --> 00:35:10,219
Right on. Okay, moving on from modding.

470
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:15,637
What does it feel like when you're updating this kind of game?

471
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:19,798
You're updating a game that kind of has the, you know, and you're balancing gameplay for

472
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:22,519
something that has just kind of the deathmatch mode, you know, the mode where everyone's

473
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,281
just competing and you don't just win by sometimes beating other players but, you know, by completing

474
00:35:26,361 --> 00:35:27,201
monuments and such.

475
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:32,983
Sometimes the content you're making has to be sort of for the campaign, which is for

476
00:35:33,023 --> 00:35:34,343
mission-driven content.

477
00:35:35,724 --> 00:35:39,084
For updating this kind of content and then creating and adding new things for it

478
00:35:39,185 --> 00:35:43,286
What's been your approach to make sure that something works across all the different game modes of Age of Empires?

479
00:35:43,866 --> 00:35:50,087
So that and so that it works for players who just want that classic experience or who want something new and something that they can sort

480
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:53,248
Of cook up themselves, I guess if that question makes sense

481
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:58,075
That makes a lot of sense. You actually just described half of the discussions that we always have.

482
00:35:58,355 --> 00:35:59,116
Yeah.

483
00:36:00,236 --> 00:36:02,637
No, it's actually something that's very, very common.

484
00:36:03,237 --> 00:36:10,280
We often run into issues like, okay, we have this new unit and it looks really cool.

485
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,061
And our team is really happy with it.

486
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:13,722
And we're like, okay, what can we do with the units?

487
00:36:14,222 --> 00:36:16,002
We can paint things like, yeah, we want it there.

488
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,744
And then we're thinking, oh, can we also just, you know, put it in the normal game?

489
00:36:20,224 --> 00:36:22,785
And then we're like, no, because then the balance will be broken.

490
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:27,046
So that there's constantly we're thinking about those things.

491
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:32,768
And it's something that you see very, very often, actually, like, okay, this small tweak

492
00:36:32,788 --> 00:36:38,990
in behavior might work in this instance, but it will break something completely, seemingly

493
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,991
unrelated in other parts of the game.

494
00:36:41,171 --> 00:36:47,453
Now we, as I said before, like a lot of the people on the team come from the Age of Empires

495
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:48,193
community.

496
00:36:48,213 --> 00:36:49,393
We're usually quite.

497
00:36:49,804 --> 00:36:56,234
quick catching those things which really helped us a lot like when we were discussing okay can we

498
00:36:56,254 --> 00:36:59,479
i'm trying to find a good example here now

499
00:37:04,081 --> 00:37:10,607
For example, if you do an AI update, where you say, okay, we have units that kind of

500
00:37:11,047 --> 00:37:15,351
kite back and forth, trying to evade projectiles.

501
00:37:15,371 --> 00:37:19,875
That's something that we can add, and it makes the game a lot more harder, especially on

502
00:37:19,895 --> 00:37:20,636
the higher levels.

503
00:37:20,776 --> 00:37:23,318
And you might think, okay, that's interesting to add.

504
00:37:23,419 --> 00:37:26,822
Like you have that kiting behavior that you see a lot of expert players do.

505
00:37:27,322 --> 00:37:28,143
Can we put that in the AI?

506
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:32,264
And then we put it in and we see, okay, the AI can now use it.

507
00:37:32,984 --> 00:37:34,305
The AI has come much harder.

508
00:37:34,945 --> 00:37:40,486
But it's not necessarily more fun, especially for more casual players.

509
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:42,807
It's just downright annoying.

510
00:37:44,427 --> 00:37:46,668
And then you're like, okay, that's not a good addition,

511
00:37:46,748 --> 00:37:48,808
even though it technically makes the AI better.

512
00:37:49,748 --> 00:37:52,749
But yeah, better is not always better for everyone.

513
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:57,050
So that's one of those practical examples where you have to look at

514
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,410
everything that goes on in the game.

515
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:03,181
And Age of Empires II is a massive game. We noticed that while working on it.

516
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:10,704
And it's not just the game mechanics, it's also that we're working on a game with history.

517
00:38:12,205 --> 00:38:15,527
And we're kind of telling, you know, people's history.

518
00:38:16,347 --> 00:38:21,409
But for a lot of people it's also like, this is their heritage, this is their background, this is their country.

519
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:26,011
And people can want to make sure that that is...

520
00:38:26,612 --> 00:38:29,493
represent it in a correct way or in an interesting way.

521
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:34,494
And if you go way off track there, then people will understandably say like,

522
00:38:34,514 --> 00:38:39,216
hey, why do you represent my country like this? It was never like that.

523
00:38:39,336 --> 00:38:43,878
So there's also a historical caution that you need to exercise there.

524
00:38:44,298 --> 00:38:48,561
Man, I didn't even think we'd get to that line of questioning today, because, forgive me, I had

525
00:38:48,722 --> 00:38:54,906
limited understanding of the nature of the DE work here. I guess I'm going to dive into that a little

526
00:38:54,927 --> 00:39:01,152
bit. And I'm just going to sort of get to brass tacks, which is, you know, you're European,

527
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:07,397
you and your colleagues, I'm sure, hail from a host of different countries. I, myself, an American,

528
00:39:07,437 --> 00:39:08,718
I mentioned earlier in the stream how

529
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:13,442
I was thankful to Age of Empires for helping me learn a little bit about civilizations

530
00:39:13,482 --> 00:39:15,144
from far across the globe.

531
00:39:16,785 --> 00:39:25,934
What did you learn when you stepped into working on civs that were based outside of Europe

532
00:39:25,974 --> 00:39:30,878
and how did you avoid making those mistakes that can lead to them being stereotyped?

533
00:39:31,899 --> 00:39:33,962
or boil down into something that doesn't represent them.

534
00:39:33,982 --> 00:39:36,845
Like it's hard to just say how and expect that to cover everything.

535
00:39:37,906 --> 00:39:39,608
But it's sort of the only question I can ask is like,

536
00:39:39,648 --> 00:39:43,932
how did you approach that sensitively and like make it fun and compelling

537
00:39:43,973 --> 00:39:48,057
without like without sort of only making it happen from a Western perspective?

538
00:39:48,077 --> 00:39:50,179
But it's going to happen from a Western perspective anyway,

539
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,741
because that's your that's your background.

540
00:39:51,781 --> 00:39:52,662
Like it's sort of all you can do.

541
00:39:54,098 --> 00:40:00,320
In a way, yes. And in a way, we also kind of need to recognize that Age of Empires has

542
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:07,282
always been a bit of a Hollywood version of history. It's very much like the basis is

543
00:40:07,302 --> 00:40:10,823
history. Everybody starts from history and that's kind of what the whole game starts

544
00:40:10,863 --> 00:40:15,344
from. But indeed, there is some representations that would say that's more Hollywood than

545
00:40:15,444 --> 00:40:15,845
realism.

546
00:40:17,945 --> 00:40:23,606
Not completely, of course. I don't want to say like, we do a lot of good historical research

547
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:28,988
and sometimes if our historical team is watching a movie, they're like, Jesus, what are these

548
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:35,769
guys doing? 15th century helmets in an 8th century spectacle, that doesn't make sense.

549
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,670
So that's kind of the level we try to go for.

550
00:40:40,531 --> 00:40:44,333
So, where was I? Right, how do we look at that?

551
00:40:44,713 --> 00:40:48,535
It's kind of something that we kind of talked about earlier.

552
00:40:48,675 --> 00:40:56,080
So we're just doing history and trying to go to find sources outside the sources that we have available.

553
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:06,337
So instead of going for the children's book or going for the local library, try to reach out to a university from that area.

554
00:41:06,817 --> 00:41:10,380
A lot of people speak English now, they're very very happy to help.

555
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:13,442
Age Vampires is a very international brand as well.

556
00:41:14,343 --> 00:41:20,209
If you reach out to a university in Peru, for example, and you ask them something about

557
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,811
aged vampires, they'll go, oh yeah, aged vampires.

558
00:41:22,932 --> 00:41:27,496
It's not just known in USA and Europe, it's known all over the world.

559
00:41:28,317 --> 00:41:33,522
And a lot of people are very enthusiastic to help on that and to kind of help them represent

560
00:41:34,003 --> 00:41:35,804
their country and their culture in the game.

561
00:41:36,545 --> 00:41:45,233
And they often also get questions like, hey, you kind of represent the game or a certain thing that happened in the history of the game in a certain way.

562
00:41:46,174 --> 00:41:49,157
And they will be like, hey, but that's maybe not the best way to do it.

563
00:41:49,477 --> 00:41:52,360
And then you can say, OK, can we adapt that? Can we make changes there?

564
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:56,224
So, yeah, there's a lot of iteration in that sense as well.

565
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:59,812
Yeah, man, there's that whole field.

566
00:41:59,832 --> 00:42:04,495
There's man, I'm envious in a specific way.

567
00:42:04,515 --> 00:42:07,556
That's like such a great challenge to tackle.

568
00:42:07,596 --> 00:42:10,058
Like you get to celebrate other people's history and culture.

569
00:42:10,078 --> 00:42:12,039
But also just like, it's fun.

570
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,119
Age of Empires is fun.

571
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:17,822
Like getting to boil, like getting to tackle the challenge of like doing that

572
00:42:17,862 --> 00:42:22,805
deep dive research while, while bringing them part of the community, I guess, is

573
00:42:22,845 --> 00:42:23,986
like, it sounds like a good time.

574
00:42:24,006 --> 00:42:25,506
Like, hey, you guys get to come to the table now.

575
00:42:26,549 --> 00:42:32,271
Yeah, exactly and that's also what a lot of people love and usually that's also where we get the most

576
00:42:32,471 --> 00:42:38,113
fierce feedback from like, oh we now added your history, your civilization to the game. You can

577
00:42:38,133 --> 00:42:41,114
expect a lot of people from those countries all of a sudden reaching out to you like, hey,

578
00:42:41,694 --> 00:42:46,435
this and this and this and this, or this is great, or that is something that is probably a bit weird.

579
00:42:46,735 --> 00:42:49,816
But usually we try to anticipate that as much as possible, of course.

580
00:42:50,716 --> 00:42:55,037
Actually, there was a fun example from way, way back.

581
00:42:55,097 --> 00:42:59,618
I think one of the first campaigns, we were looking at a new civilization.

582
00:42:59,798 --> 00:43:02,918
Like, okay, we're going to add a new campaign for this civilization.

583
00:43:02,938 --> 00:43:05,679
We're like, okay, this guy had an interesting story to tell.

584
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:15,490
And then we asked at the local community or the people from that country to get some ideas.

585
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:18,995
And they were like, oh, that's kind of like our local Hitler.

586
00:43:19,415 --> 00:43:21,538
You don't want to glorify that guy.

587
00:43:21,578 --> 00:43:23,580
And we're like, OK, then we won't.

588
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:39,868
So yeah, it can be tricky, but that's also a perfect example of showing like, okay, what is shown here in Western history is limited, or it is a very limited or different perspective, and you need to be careful with that.

589
00:43:41,157 --> 00:43:45,321
Right on. Yeah, that reminds me of one of my favorite quotes I've ever heard about Age of Empires,

590
00:43:45,381 --> 00:43:49,105
sort of to give credit to the original team, was from a writer named LaToya Peterson.

591
00:43:49,145 --> 00:43:55,031
I saw her speaking at IndieCade, and she was talking about how the Age of Conquerors campaign,

592
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:59,575
like the first campaign you dive into is the Incans, or Aztecs?

593
00:44:01,897 --> 00:44:08,943
Aztecs, thank you, yeah. And how the Aztecs fought off Spanish conquerors, and in her

594
00:44:08,983 --> 00:44:15,048
perspective she said that's such an interesting perspective for a game to center, especially

595
00:44:15,108 --> 00:44:17,990
given how Age of Empires sort of celebrates...

596
00:44:20,452 --> 00:44:26,116
It's fair to say Age of Empires celebrates the technological advancement of European nations a lot.

597
00:44:26,636 --> 00:44:35,303
Once in this game it gets exciting, once gunpowder and horseback riding get added to the mix and you feel like you're a stronger civilization.

598
00:44:35,343 --> 00:44:43,389
But to have Age of Empires be a game that took this nation and sort of put them on even footing with the Spanish from a gameplay perspective and say,

599
00:44:43,489 --> 00:44:45,751
hey, this is the story of their resistance and their...

600
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:50,375
perseverance against a conquering group.

601
00:44:51,095 --> 00:44:52,577
Her perspective on that was super...

602
00:44:53,438 --> 00:44:56,442
I already enjoyed that campaign so much when I played this when I was younger

603
00:44:56,462 --> 00:45:00,847
and I thought her take on it was really good.

604
00:45:02,508 --> 00:45:08,153
Yeah, indeed. I think we added like three new campaigns with Definitive Edition.

605
00:45:08,774 --> 00:45:13,258
And all three of them have a very, very different approach to a story we want to tell.

606
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:15,040
I think one is about just conquest.

607
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:21,105
It was a good story, so we were like, okay, it's just about conquest, but it's such a good story, we just need to do it.

608
00:45:21,866 --> 00:45:23,147
And then there was one about like...

609
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:27,409
Well, basically a people that was about to be extinct

610
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:32,791
So yeah, it's it's it's very very different kind of approaches

611
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:36,792
That's that that you know that we all want to tell yeah

612
00:45:36,992 --> 00:45:40,173
I guess as a come to think of it as a as both a designer and a modder

613
00:45:40,994 --> 00:45:44,455
Why I want to ask your perspective one thing Age of Empires is a really good

614
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:50,657
You know RTS war game like it's great when you want to build an army build the most advanced army

615
00:45:50,757 --> 00:45:53,558
You know play rock-paper-scissors with your opponents and figure out what?

616
00:45:54,078 --> 00:45:59,461
what's good against what. How as a designer do you do you make Age of Empires fun when players just

617
00:45:59,481 --> 00:46:04,943
kind of want to do what I'm doing here and focus on building a town and making you know sort of

618
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:09,666
bling into the economic or wonder victories of the game the more peaceful alternatives which

619
00:46:09,706 --> 00:46:16,849
isn't to say like the peace side is inherently better or anything just more like my favorite

620
00:46:16,869 --> 00:46:21,391
thing in Age of Empires was always just sitting in a room and fiddling with my toy soldiers I

621
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:22,632
guess more than it was like.

622
00:46:23,253 --> 00:46:25,916
diving into other people's territories and screwing up their stuff.

623
00:46:27,478 --> 00:46:29,822
I guess, how do you make Age of Empires fun

624
00:46:30,102 --> 00:46:31,224
across those different game modes?

625
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,714
That's the first time I'm getting this question and I love it.

626
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:43,717
So this is really interesting because when we design new content, a new civilization,

627
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:50,080
there's... I think a lot of... Okay, before I get to that, first of all, like, big credit

628
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:54,762
to the original developers for making a game that has this kind of...

629
00:46:55,703 --> 00:47:02,810
incredibly interesting learning curve. Like, you can be an absolute pro and enjoy the game in a very different way,

630
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:09,196
or you can be very casual, just play and build a city and still have the same amount of fun.

631
00:47:09,737 --> 00:47:12,179
And that's the absolute beauty of Age of Empires.

632
00:47:13,421 --> 00:47:17,945
So when we started working on new civs, we always

633
00:47:19,965 --> 00:47:25,008
The balance that we eventually want to go for and the gameplay that we eventually want to go for

634
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:30,130
Needs to be suitable for the absolute top players. Like they need to play it

635
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:36,333
It needs to be balanced for them. But then at the same time we're like, okay we have new

636
00:47:37,434 --> 00:47:44,358
Mechanics, new units. Are they also fun for people who just want to mess around a bit, have some fun?

637
00:47:45,499 --> 00:47:49,422
Because then we were like, okay, for example, a unit that has...

638
00:47:50,503 --> 00:47:52,764
Let's say they have extra visibility range.

639
00:47:53,985 --> 00:47:56,407
That can be a strong bonus for expert players.

640
00:47:56,988 --> 00:48:01,392
But a more casual player will be like, I don't care. I don't care about that.

641
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:02,833
That's like nothing.

642
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:08,718
For my playstyle, as a casual player, just seeing a bit further, that's absolutely nothing.

643
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:14,240
And then you're like, okay, it might be interesting for a certain group, but absolutely not for a different group.

644
00:48:14,981 --> 00:48:19,702
And a lot of the bonuses we kind of iterate like that, like, okay, it might be technically a good bonus,

645
00:48:20,102 --> 00:48:23,543
but for a lot of people it's just not the time. And then it just goes out.

646
00:48:24,343 --> 00:48:31,325
So yeah, it's definitely something that is very present.

647
00:48:31,585 --> 00:48:34,145
And it's actually interesting, it's the first time I get the question,

648
00:48:34,205 --> 00:48:36,786
it's such a big part of the development of Neo-Civilization.

649
00:48:37,455 --> 00:48:39,737
Hey, hey, I'm happy, I'm happy that we're getting,

650
00:48:39,837 --> 00:48:40,938
happy that our questions are that good.

651
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:42,900
Yeah.

652
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:45,082
We have 10 minutes left, about 10 minutes left,

653
00:48:45,162 --> 00:48:47,244
maybe a little less, depending on how we go.

654
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:49,345
But we're gonna try and wrap things up

655
00:48:49,406 --> 00:48:50,967
by the top of the next hour.

656
00:48:51,627 --> 00:48:54,650
If you've got questions for Bert, drop them in chat.

657
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:57,472
I'll ask them, we'd love to have them.

658
00:48:58,834 --> 00:49:02,817
For myself, I guess I might as well ask,

659
00:49:03,137 --> 00:49:05,079
there have been a lot of changes in,

660
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:14,384
conventions for how people interact with RTS games. That's kind of a UI, UX question is where

661
00:49:14,404 --> 00:49:19,347
I'm sort of bringing this to is I was super surprised when I booted this up and the menu

662
00:49:19,387 --> 00:49:21,588
was really faithful to what I remembered.

663
00:49:22,088 --> 00:49:27,770
Age of Empires 2 being. I was then confounded by the problem of, oh right, I don't know where to research my new technologies

664
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:33,211
because I forgot that in Age of Empires the tech tree is not just a thing you dive into and tell something to research

665
00:49:33,231 --> 00:49:37,892
because I've been playing Civ and Age of Wonders and all these other games.

666
00:49:37,912 --> 00:49:41,313
You have to go to the buildings and research them as you unlock tier by tier.

667
00:49:44,274 --> 00:49:50,496
With that said, how did you deal with the concept of changes in menus?

668
00:49:50,836 --> 00:49:55,138
How did you preserve the old game while making sure it followed modern menu logic?

669
00:49:57,138 --> 00:50:02,420
That was another big challenge because we noticed that, especially in UI flow,

670
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,181
that Age of Empires did not evolve in the last 20 years. At all.

671
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:14,065
So we have some catching up to do, but at the same time we don't want to alienate older players, existing community,

672
00:50:14,365 --> 00:50:20,730
but also there's a lot of UI that's just inherent to the gameplay.

673
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:24,093
Like you said, your technologies are researched in buildings, not in the tech tree.

674
00:50:24,113 --> 00:50:27,196
The tech tree here in Age of Empires is more informative rather than interactive.

675
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:36,523
And in that sense, a lot of the UI improvements we did was more looking at what do modern

676
00:50:36,623 --> 00:50:39,845
RTS games offer and what do we not have.

677
00:50:40,206 --> 00:50:42,948
And then we noticed a lot of things that were completely missing.

678
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:50,533
RTS games are a lot about management, about resource management, unit management, time

679
00:50:50,573 --> 00:50:53,315
management, everything is management and oversight.

680
00:50:53,816 --> 00:50:57,118
And then we noticed like Age of Empires just doesn't have that.

681
00:50:59,658 --> 00:51:00,959
that you actually should have.

682
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:06,466
A quick example, I mean, there's a few things that you can see on the screen right now.

683
00:51:07,227 --> 00:51:11,592
You're making a monk right now, and right after that you're researching a technology.

684
00:51:12,217 --> 00:51:18,202
In the past you could not do that, you could only do one at a time and you would have to come back to your building afterwards to do it.

685
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:27,611
At the same time, if you click on that monastery, you will see there's two bars on top of it.

686
00:51:27,731 --> 00:51:35,858
One is the bar which is just for HP and then one is the bar that shows how the progress is of that specific technology.

687
00:51:36,499 --> 00:51:42,823
So it's like little things that help you in seeing what's going on in your empire without the need to constantly

688
00:51:43,263 --> 00:51:51,168
Click around the whole time. So what we our approach was like, okay less time fighting UI and more time fighting your opponent

689
00:51:51,429 --> 00:51:52,389
That was really the big

690
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:54,591
approach that we try to take

691
00:51:55,308 --> 00:51:55,628
Right on.

692
00:51:56,929 --> 00:52:01,051
You can see me in the stream starting to do one of my favorite things, which was build a wall around my territory.

693
00:52:01,111 --> 00:52:07,115
I don't know why. It was always just nice. It helped me organize my space, I think I felt like.

694
00:52:07,935 --> 00:52:11,857
I will grab one of LurkerSauce's questions from chat.

695
00:52:12,538 --> 00:52:13,818
This is kind of a technical question.

696
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:16,800
How did you guys write... or, excuse me.

697
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:21,283
Did you all write how things renders that they don't take up much space before,

698
00:52:21,423 --> 00:52:25,485
like before all units would be rendered on the map that did not matter where you moved your view?

699
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:31,009
They wonder how the compression was done to have it to 50%. So I guess that's the question is,

700
00:52:31,049 --> 00:52:35,291
how did you change how the game rendered? Because we were talking earlier about the

701
00:52:35,331 --> 00:52:37,953
large file size for the game for context.

702
00:52:39,472 --> 00:52:42,055
Yeah, so the render is completely new actually.

703
00:52:42,295 --> 00:52:50,843
So in the past we had, yeah, I think we had 265 colors in total for everything.

704
00:52:50,903 --> 00:52:56,028
So units, terrains, water, player colors, all of that was displayed with just 265 colors.

705
00:52:58,352 --> 00:53:03,676
Now, we also noticed the reason that the HPM Presto was so efficient was because it only

706
00:53:03,736 --> 00:53:05,538
had 265 columns.

707
00:53:05,718 --> 00:53:08,741
That made the assets very, very, very small.

708
00:53:09,041 --> 00:53:14,326
It's like comparing a GIF or a GIF, I don't even know how to pronounce it, to a PNG.

709
00:53:14,526 --> 00:53:17,969
The amount of colors is just staggeringly different.

710
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:20,151
And that's kind of...

711
00:53:21,449 --> 00:53:27,272
But then we had the issue, okay, we have a DE version, we need to have more than 265 colors.

712
00:53:28,513 --> 00:53:35,516
So what we did then was create specific palettes of 265 colors per asset.

713
00:53:36,437 --> 00:53:41,980
Which means that the color space is so much bigger, so much bigger, but we still have that efficiency.

714
00:53:43,502 --> 00:53:47,849
from the old compression. Like we can still compress to a certain extent

715
00:53:49,672 --> 00:53:51,375
while having a much greater quality

716
00:53:52,597 --> 00:53:55,141
just by doing per asset pallets.

717
00:53:56,835 --> 00:54:01,718
Right on. That hopefully makes sense for people who understand that technology.

718
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:05,761
I am more of a writer than a programmer, unfortunately.

719
00:54:08,183 --> 00:54:12,286
And before we go, I will grab Hiwata's question. Thanks for dropping by, Hiwata.

720
00:54:12,946 --> 00:54:15,328
What does the future look like for spectator mode for the game?

721
00:54:16,149 --> 00:54:19,752
Uh, they also asked, has that been asked already? No, it's not been asked.

722
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:24,135
Um, are you guys working on a spectator mode? I should have looked this up beforehand. Are you

723
00:54:24,155 --> 00:54:27,958
working on a spectator mode? And if so, how's it going? And what does it take to implement a

724
00:54:27,978 --> 00:54:28,599
spectator mode?

725
00:54:29,812 --> 00:54:36,795
Yes, so there is a spectator mode in the game. You can go to a lobby which currently showcases

726
00:54:37,135 --> 00:54:44,178
all the games that are currently being played in multiplayer. Now there is still more work that

727
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:50,181
can be done on that. Just like I said before, like the modding tools, there can be some more

728
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:55,843
effort and work done on improving that side of the game. But the same for spectator mode.

729
00:54:56,575 --> 00:54:58,598
there is much more that you can do with that.

730
00:54:58,678 --> 00:55:00,880
And it's one of those things where, again,

731
00:55:01,721 --> 00:55:05,785
we have this example of the community working alongside

732
00:55:06,346 --> 00:55:08,528
while the DE was in development.

733
00:55:08,728 --> 00:55:12,232
Like, all of a sudden, there were big spectator tools

734
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:13,753
specifically for the old version.

735
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:15,916
And you're like, OK, that is amazing.

736
00:55:16,777 --> 00:55:19,402
That's currently not in VE, so what do we do with that?

737
00:55:19,522 --> 00:55:24,511
So that's one of those things that we're just going to keep on looking at and see where

738
00:55:24,551 --> 00:55:25,052
we end up.

739
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:26,154
But as I said before...

740
00:55:27,431 --> 00:55:31,735
We do have a lot of support currently going on for Age of Empires 2

741
00:55:32,335 --> 00:55:34,357
and we will keep on adding to this game.

742
00:55:34,697 --> 00:55:38,541
And spectator mode, I'm quite sure there will be improvements to that as well.

743
00:55:39,281 --> 00:55:41,763
Actually, next week there will already be improvements to that.

744
00:55:42,824 --> 00:55:50,831
Mostly bug fixing, but anything that helps in making a better spectator experience is a plus at this point.

745
00:55:52,118 --> 00:55:54,639
Oh man, that's actually...

746
00:55:54,819 --> 00:56:00,342
Mil, funny enough, Mil is asking a question that sort of involves my wrap-up.

747
00:56:00,663 --> 00:56:06,786
Mil wants to know if you and the Age of Empires team will be at GDC at all next year.

748
00:56:06,806 --> 00:56:10,768
I have no idea.

749
00:56:11,328 --> 00:56:16,951
That is all Microsoft's decision and I am at this point blissfully unaware of anything.

750
00:56:17,549 --> 00:56:20,631
That's fine. That actually helps me start wrapping things up.

751
00:56:21,051 --> 00:56:26,294
This has been another stream on the Game Developers Conference Twitch channel.

752
00:56:27,235 --> 00:56:28,616
Thank you all for coming out today, everyone.

753
00:56:28,656 --> 00:56:31,358
Thank you to the Age of Empires 2 community for coming out.

754
00:56:31,378 --> 00:56:33,599
Thank you to all the interested game developers who dropped by.

755
00:56:33,619 --> 00:56:38,522
I guess there's a lot of overlap between the two when you come to it.

756
00:56:39,342 --> 00:56:43,285
Hi Wada, to answer your question that just went up in chat, yes, this will go up on YouTube.

757
00:56:43,305 --> 00:56:47,107
You can watch the entire archive on YouTube or Twitch later this afternoon.

758
00:56:48,467 --> 00:56:52,370
If you enjoyed watching the stream and you're new to our channel, we would love to have you follow us

759
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:56,912
because we go live regularly with interviews with really great and interesting game developers,

760
00:56:56,972 --> 00:57:00,834
big and small. We've had AAA devs on the channel, we've had great indies on the channel,

761
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,076
everyone from Insomniac Games to...

762
00:57:05,827 --> 00:57:06,627
the folks from

763
00:57:07,807 --> 00:57:08,487
Night in the woods

764
00:57:09,828 --> 00:57:13,469
It's been a great year on this channel. I'm really thankful for everyone who's dropped by and watched

765
00:57:14,129 --> 00:57:18,390
And next year we're gonna keep doing some amazing stuff. The holidays start ramping up for us

766
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:22,571
So this is actually might wind up being our last stream of 2019, but that's fine

767
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:25,911
We will be doing stuff in the new year as we get closer to GDC

768
00:57:26,512 --> 00:57:30,455
If you yourself are a game developer or interested in game development and want to go to GDC,

769
00:57:31,116 --> 00:57:35,940
you can scroll down and click on the register for GDC button and get more info about passes

770
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,165
and prices for next year's show, which is from March 16th to March 20th. If you're going to

771
00:57:41,185 --> 00:57:44,548
register for GDC, I'm obligated to tell you that now is the best time to do it because

772
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:48,751
early pricing will go up in January, I believe.

773
00:57:49,972 --> 00:57:52,413
Other than that, that's about it.

774
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:56,814
Bert, if they have questions about the making of Age of Empires 2, where should they ask...

775
00:57:56,974 --> 00:58:00,055
or Definitive Edition specifically, where should they ask them?

776
00:58:01,876 --> 00:58:05,797
Most of the communication is actually through the official Age of Empires Discord,

777
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:09,478
but if you have more specific questions for us specifically, or for me specifically,

778
00:58:09,498 --> 00:58:15,300
you can also go to Twitter, Age of Empires, Forgotten Empires, or just my own handle,

779
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,760
which is scission.ee.

780
00:58:18,901 --> 00:58:20,422
That might not make it to them.

781
00:58:20,442 --> 00:58:24,645
But yeah, we're pretty open to the community.

782
00:58:25,046 --> 00:58:26,947
We come from the community, we're pretty open to them.

783
00:58:27,367 --> 00:58:28,508
We like to chat with them.

784
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,350
So yeah, any place will usually work.

785
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:34,032
The forest, there's an Age of Empires 2 subreddit as well.

786
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:38,155
The community is so big, your answers will probably...

787
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:39,556
You'll find the answers somewhere, probably.

788
00:58:40,216 --> 00:58:40,937
Right on with that.

789
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:42,878
Have a good day, everyone.

790
00:58:43,058 --> 00:58:46,741
And have a happy holiday, if you are planning to have one.

791
00:58:47,201 --> 00:58:47,482
Bye!
