00:00:11,924 --> 00:00:18,889
Hello everybody. We gotta get started. I know there was a card reader problem, but it turns

2
00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:25,833
out we still have to end at 520. So we gotta get it moving along, because we have three delightful

3
00:00:26,053 --> 00:00:30,896
micro-postmortems. Hello, I'm Brandon Sheffield. I'm unrelated to this, but I run the Career

4
00:00:30,936 --> 00:00:35,819
Seminar, and so that's why I'm here talking to you right now. I hope you enjoyed it. This is the

5
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:40,963
last talk of the show. So yeah, woo indeed!

6
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,338
We've almost made it.

7
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:49,940
So we got three Postmortems for you.

8
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,382
We got Gabe McGill talking about Blaseball.

9
00:00:54,262 --> 00:01:02,108
We have, yes, we have Vincent Diamante, who I realized I've known for 22 years, talking

10
00:01:02,168 --> 00:01:04,009
about the audio for Sky.

11
00:01:04,669 --> 00:01:08,792
And then we have Zellivere Nelson, Jr., who's going to talk about...

12
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:16,446
the uh uh warlord or i can never say the whole space warlord organ trading simulator yeah there

13
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:22,011
you go there's there's so many words in that title okay let's get started with gabe

14
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:33,142
hi everybody congratulations on surviving gdc i have 150 slides so i'm gonna go quickly

15
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:40,475
My name is Gabe McGill. I'm a product designer at The Game Band. I joined Blaseball right when it

16
00:01:40,555 --> 00:01:45,099
started, so we're really going to do this. We made a lot of slides. Joel is sitting in the front.

17
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,502
Shout out. We gave a talk the other day on Blaseball, and it turns out that giving a talk

18
00:01:49,522 --> 00:01:54,647
with another person is incredibly difficult, and never having met him before in my entire life,

19
00:01:54,707 --> 00:01:59,270
it's very hard to do so. So what is Blaseball? Well, it's a baseball league. That's really all

20
00:01:59,310 --> 00:01:59,811
you need to know.

21
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:05,201
except for the part where it's also a horror game or the community is the one who's driving the story.

22
00:02:06,183 --> 00:02:10,090
Blaseball is really a game about choice. This is probably the best encapsulation we've found.

23
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:16,802
And it's really, really weird. Instead of having a playthrough for every single player, like in say,

24
00:02:16,822 --> 00:02:23,128
a video game, we all have one shared understanding of the universe. Blaseball is just one thing,

25
00:02:23,188 --> 00:02:27,152
but it's kind of really hard to know what's going on if you're just on the website. So

26
00:02:27,553 --> 00:02:31,176
our understanding actually takes place on Reddit, Discord, etc.

27
00:02:32,017 --> 00:02:34,478
We also develop it on a highly compressed time schedule.

28
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:36,259
We have an election every week,

29
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,920
and we're basically running an entire sports season

30
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,541
in that week, so if we need to change something,

31
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:42,981
we find out Wednesday,

32
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:44,762
and we have to make the change by Sunday.

33
00:02:45,762 --> 00:02:49,824
So we iterate rapidly, and our iteration is primarily

34
00:02:49,884 --> 00:02:52,345
dictated by the outcome of an unpredictable system.

35
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:53,485
We're building the simulation,

36
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:55,146
the fans are setting up inputs,

37
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,246
we don't know what's going to happen,

38
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:58,747
and that's the thing that we use to drive direction.

39
00:02:59,603 --> 00:03:01,444
And we get really, really weird

40
00:03:01,524 --> 00:03:03,204
by what I call boiling the frog.

41
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:05,425
We take incremental steps,

42
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:07,325
adding one simple system at a time,

43
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:10,546
and then the combination of those systems together

44
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:12,247
gets us to very strange places.

45
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:13,447
Chaos reigns.

46
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:17,548
The experience then becomes about those iterations.

47
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:20,329
Your experience is grounded in baseball,

48
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:23,170
that is until somebody gets incinerated on the field.

49
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,810
Then your experience is grounded in baseball

50
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,831
where somebody gets incinerated on the field.

51
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:28,591
Awesome.

52
00:03:30,806 --> 00:03:35,349
Ultimately though, the fan input I think is one of the things that makes it the most unique.

53
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:40,833
We aren't just going out of our way to tell a story, we are actually allowing the fans

54
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:45,176
to control what goes into it in the same way that maybe a tabletop GM would.

55
00:03:47,134 --> 00:03:50,175
So we have this combination of factors,

56
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:52,616
the output of the simulation, input from the fans,

57
00:03:53,036 --> 00:03:54,657
and our direction of development.

58
00:03:55,117 --> 00:03:56,337
All of those things coincide

59
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:58,898
to make the thing that is Blaseball.

60
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:01,199
We can't do everything at once, though.

61
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,940
You can imagine if everyone in this room

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,820
wanted to go to a different place to eat,

63
00:04:06,261 --> 00:04:08,601
it'd be really hard to pick a place to go eat.

64
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:12,082
So we need to boil it down to one simple thing.

65
00:04:12,122 --> 00:04:14,703
That's why we have one election each week.

66
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:18,284
in order to coalesce the entire community

67
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:20,645
into one specific movement forward.

68
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:25,406
So, like, what am I talking about?

69
00:04:25,726 --> 00:04:27,346
We're basically on the same side as the fans.

70
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:29,707
We are also watching this live thing play out,

71
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:32,388
saying, oh my god, can you believe that just happened?

72
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,008
And basically what we're trying to do

73
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:37,449
is create the possibility space.

74
00:04:38,109 --> 00:04:41,210
So we think in terms of systems primarily,

75
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,150
even though the experience we're trying to create

76
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:43,870
is a narrative one.

77
00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:46,980
We break it down into these three categories.

78
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,821
So beats are the things that we specifically do.

79
00:04:50,242 --> 00:04:51,182
This is going to happen.

80
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:55,825
These are great moments to say, introduce God,

81
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:58,006
have God show up and speak to you

82
00:04:58,066 --> 00:04:59,967
for blaspheming or succeeding.

83
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:04,190
And these beats often create prompts.

84
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,191
So prompts are a question to the player.

85
00:05:06,571 --> 00:05:08,813
God just showed up and told you that you're doing a bad job.

86
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:09,853
What do you do?

87
00:05:11,182 --> 00:05:12,743
We have a whole bunch of different kinds of questions

88
00:05:12,783 --> 00:05:15,425
we can ask, and what you care about is a really cool one.

89
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:19,167
And ultimately, the way that question

90
00:05:19,207 --> 00:05:21,708
is going to be answered is either by a narrative decision

91
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,909
or filling in some sort of data.

92
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,831
We have this concept of what we call the ad lib where.

93
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:28,518
We know something is going to happen,

94
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:30,839
but then we allow the fans to say to whom.

95
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,042
So we have these two things that we try to conflate

96
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:38,024
as often as possible, system and narrative.

97
00:05:38,444 --> 00:05:41,026
If something is important in terms of the story,

98
00:05:41,146 --> 00:05:43,447
we should see it take place on the field of play.

99
00:05:43,708 --> 00:05:45,269
It should happen during a baseball game.

100
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:50,212
If, for example, Luke Krikese shows up,

101
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:54,175
he better impact what's actually gonna happen in the sport.

102
00:05:56,004 --> 00:05:57,946
And every time we make a prompt,

103
00:05:58,086 --> 00:05:59,267
we are also making a promise.

104
00:06:00,047 --> 00:06:01,628
When you tell us what you care about,

105
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:02,649
we will respect that.

106
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,612
And how do we respect that?

107
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:10,034
Well, we like to reward with consequence.

108
00:06:11,656 --> 00:06:13,297
The consequence is probably a system,

109
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:15,298
and it's probably a cursed system.

110
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,742
Ultimately, though, the best situation

111
00:06:20,802 --> 00:06:22,403
are when the fans have a very clear idea

112
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,264
of what's going on.

113
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:26,167
what they want to do, what they can do,

114
00:06:26,527 --> 00:06:30,211
and then we throw them a monkey wrench, or monkey's paw.

115
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,012
If you're unfamiliar with the term,

116
00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:36,957
it's basically an unintended consequence.

117
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,719
So you get the thing that you do want,

118
00:06:39,059 --> 00:06:41,361
and you also get something that you very much do not.

119
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,343
You can think of it like a mixed success

120
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:44,744
in a tabletop RPG.

121
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:47,867
You get what you want, and you get what you want.

122
00:06:48,448 --> 00:06:48,648
But...

123
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:53,673
This allows the fans to have one very specific goal that they're trying to work towards,

124
00:06:54,153 --> 00:06:58,618
and then the complication of the story comes out as we introduce some secondary effect.

125
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,602
Sometimes they just want to mess around and find out what happens.

126
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:07,827
But typically when it's more focused, everybody has more fun.

127
00:07:08,187 --> 00:07:14,173
It's a lot easier to tell one specific story, even if ultimately that ends up in a labor strike.

128
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:20,631
So when we do a good job, we give the fans the thing that they want, and then also introduce

129
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:26,813
a complication that moves the story forward. There's not really any point to all of this

130
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:32,495
unless there are people playing it. So we have this concept of the digital stage. The key here

131
00:07:32,575 --> 00:07:36,936
is that we have a shared world that is changing. When it changes, it changes at the same time,

132
00:07:37,236 --> 00:07:42,758
and it changes for all of us. This is pretty different than how we would say experience an MMO.

133
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,955
I play a lot of Final Fantasy XIV, and in that game I'm very much in control of my story.

134
00:07:48,856 --> 00:07:55,423
I can go do the main story quest for 60 hours, and that might be entirely different from

135
00:07:55,463 --> 00:07:57,305
your experience of raiding.

136
00:07:58,805 --> 00:08:01,667
But in Blaseball, we're always doing the same thing.

137
00:08:02,007 --> 00:08:04,749
We would be watching the same story unfold for both of us.

138
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:09,633
Well, okay, or maybe 24 because we have 24 teams

139
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:11,414
or maybe like 300 to 400

140
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,296
because that's how many players there are in the league.

141
00:08:13,716 --> 00:08:14,717
But I think ultimately,

142
00:08:15,838 --> 00:08:17,880
The more it can be boiled down the more successful it is

143
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,823
Narrative choice takes place on the collective stage

144
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:27,529
Everyone here participating gets to input into the choice, then we all experience the consequence together

145
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,331
Here's an example

146
00:08:31,173 --> 00:08:35,777
The forbidden book exists we open the forbidden book something bad happens

147
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:40,757
But because it's happening in real time,

148
00:08:40,798 --> 00:08:42,900
the experience can still be asynchronous.

149
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,282
We love to tell stories.

150
00:08:45,683 --> 00:08:47,044
We wanna tell you about what happened.

151
00:08:47,725 --> 00:08:48,586
Just look at this talk.

152
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:51,629
So for the fans, typically the experience

153
00:08:51,669 --> 00:08:52,830
of something like the Forbidden Book goes like this.

154
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:52,910
Wow.

155
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,010
What?

156
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,411
Where'd the book go?

157
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:53,651
It was like,

158
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:53,911
I don't know,

159
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:54,452
I don't know what I missed.

160
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:54,652
Wait, what?

161
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:54,993
Come back, please.

162
00:08:55,013 --> 00:08:55,413
Wait, where did it go?

163
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:55,813
I think I missed it.

164
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:56,454
Correlation, I think I missed it.

165
00:08:56,474 --> 00:08:56,734
I'm not, sorry.

166
00:08:56,754 --> 00:08:56,995
Oh, it's here.

167
00:08:57,015 --> 00:08:57,475
Anyone here remember it?

168
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,236
There's a shirt that you got wit this,

169
00:08:58,256 --> 00:08:58,777
the one that I was wearing.

170
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,463
And even if we're having an asynchronous experience

171
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:08,946
where the way that we're digesting the story

172
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,708
is second hand through our friends,

173
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:13,451
the change still happened in the moment.

174
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,113
It's the same thing for all of us,

175
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:16,675
even if our understanding of it is different.

176
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,320
The world we knew yesterday no longer exists,

177
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,403
and now the player has been transformed.

178
00:09:26,742 --> 00:09:29,983
I'm just gonna reiterate that we don't know what happens.

179
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:31,683
The simulation isn't deterministic.

180
00:09:31,783 --> 00:09:33,704
We set things up with probabilities.

181
00:09:33,764 --> 00:09:36,205
We have some idea that X could occur,

182
00:09:37,045 --> 00:09:38,626
and then we roll dice.

183
00:09:40,906 --> 00:09:42,927
We want specific things to happen, though,

184
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:46,048
and then we find out at the same time as the fans to whom.

185
00:09:47,188 --> 00:09:48,949
Unfortunately, this means that we have to be

186
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:50,629
in a state of sort of constant vigilance.

187
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,070
If you don't know who your protagonist is,

188
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,131
it's really hard to plan the end of your story.

189
00:09:57,517 --> 00:10:00,321
So whatever happens on the website is the truth.

190
00:10:00,381 --> 00:10:02,223
This is something that we say to ourselves all the time,

191
00:10:02,263 --> 00:10:05,306
especially when it comes to leaning into bugs.

192
00:10:05,947 --> 00:10:07,529
If there's a bug that affects the data,

193
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:10,172
well, the only data we're manipulating is production.

194
00:10:10,632 --> 00:10:12,895
So that means that now we have a new universe.

195
00:10:12,935 --> 00:10:14,437
Reality is different, and it's different

196
00:10:14,477 --> 00:10:17,000
because that bug actually did happen in the real world.

197
00:10:18,007 --> 00:10:20,648
And we try not to unwind things or roll back things

198
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,989
unless it's actually critical to do so.

199
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:26,650
This one example, we have a promise to the fans

200
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:29,191
where the community is going to be the one

201
00:10:29,271 --> 00:10:30,352
who's driving the story.

202
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:33,673
So if someone is able to say, get infinite votes,

203
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:36,414
we would undo that because it's breaking

204
00:10:36,454 --> 00:10:38,055
the fundamental promise of what baseball is.

205
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,961
So let's run through an example as quickly as we can

206
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:45,582
in terms of how we would design one of these things.

207
00:10:46,202 --> 00:10:47,483
We have the idea of umpire.

208
00:10:47,523 --> 00:10:49,183
That's the guy who stands behind the catcher.

209
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,823
If you're not familiar with baseball,

210
00:10:51,104 --> 00:10:52,524
I'm sorry, I can't really help you.

211
00:10:54,965 --> 00:10:57,225
Because they get the ball thrown at them really hard,

212
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:58,326
they need to be really big.

213
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:01,126
So that means that their two responsibilities

214
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:05,087
in this stage play are to loom and to pass judgment.

215
00:11:05,628 --> 00:11:06,268
That's awesome.

216
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:08,408
If you're making a horror game, that's fantastic.

217
00:11:09,975 --> 00:11:10,716
So what do they do?

218
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:13,938
Well, thematically, we've already established

219
00:11:14,338 --> 00:11:15,559
we have these two things.

220
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,361
So then we wanna figure out

221
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:19,422
how can we make the simplest possible system

222
00:11:19,482 --> 00:11:20,703
to achieve those two things?

223
00:11:21,483 --> 00:11:23,925
Most of the time, we get inspiration from something else.

224
00:11:24,405 --> 00:11:25,566
In this case, Stephen Bell,

225
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:27,027
who unfortunately can't be here,

226
00:11:27,548 --> 00:11:29,269
asked what if an umpire could shoot somebody

227
00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:30,230
like a naked gun?

228
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,451
Obviously a great idea.

229
00:11:33,532 --> 00:11:36,254
So because that's either horrific or hilarious,

230
00:11:36,294 --> 00:11:37,274
depending on the framing,

231
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:39,343
we kind of roll with it.

232
00:11:39,423 --> 00:11:40,906
You can interpret it in either way.

233
00:11:43,071 --> 00:11:44,976
That makes a lot of questions though.

234
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:46,519
When you can kill somebody.

235
00:11:47,317 --> 00:11:49,918
Well, you have to figure out where they can go.

236
00:11:50,198 --> 00:11:51,579
What happens in the simulation?

237
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,600
Can a dead player play blazeball?

238
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,521
In this case, no, that's like specifically the thing

239
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,842
it means, you can't anymore.

240
00:11:57,942 --> 00:11:59,883
So if an umpire incinerates a player,

241
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:01,564
they have to be removed from the team

242
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:02,645
and replaced with someone else.

243
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:05,666
And that was the system as it was first introduced,

244
00:12:05,906 --> 00:12:06,747
just those two rules.

245
00:12:06,787 --> 00:12:08,848
The player goes away and a new player is there instead.

246
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:10,929
And then we keep adding to it.

247
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:13,531
So if someone dies, where do they go?

248
00:12:14,271 --> 00:12:15,171
And we introduce...

249
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:17,674
The answers to those questions is piecemeal.

250
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,117
So we find out that players get incinerated

251
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,519
and leave the league and then we find out

252
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,861
that they end up in the Hall of Flame.

253
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:24,783
And then we find out that the Hall of Flame

254
00:12:24,923 --> 00:12:27,947
actually, its purpose is to create an all-star team

255
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:29,348
to kill an antagonistic god.

256
00:12:33,113 --> 00:12:33,253
So,

257
00:12:34,512 --> 00:12:37,715
Umpires always existed, but we need some sort of inciting incident,

258
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:40,598
and we really want that inciting incident to be driven by the fans.

259
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:43,582
In this case, it was the opening of the book.

260
00:12:43,622 --> 00:12:47,205
It's a scripted moment that resulted from an election.

261
00:12:48,506 --> 00:12:54,809
The player that it specifically chose to incinerate for the first time, we didn't choose, we just set up a simple rule, picked the best player.

262
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:58,451
Then we wrote a script to establish what would happen.

263
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,992
The umpire's eyes turn white, Moe the Swallowed by a Hellmouth.

264
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:03,193
The first incineration, shocking.

265
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:05,714
But it's also tipping our hand at the system.

266
00:13:06,295 --> 00:13:09,136
We introduced Solar Eclipse at the same time as incineration.

267
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,777
That is all you basically need to know for the system.

268
00:13:12,488 --> 00:13:14,191
The interpretation though would be something like this,

269
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:16,094
an umpire just killed somebody.

270
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:17,536
What does that mean?

271
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,839
And that second piece really, if you think about it,

272
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,522
is what playing blazeball is.

273
00:13:21,542 --> 00:13:24,507
So you ask yourself questions like,

274
00:13:24,847 --> 00:13:25,849
can players just die now?

275
00:13:28,412 --> 00:13:29,852
but only in specific circumstances.

276
00:13:30,273 --> 00:13:33,274
This is the part where we can sort of tell the story.

277
00:13:33,534 --> 00:13:35,035
It's not just a random die roll.

278
00:13:36,356 --> 00:13:38,797
It also allows us to introduce more complications.

279
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:42,539
So we have a modification of unstable,

280
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:43,519
a player becomes unstable,

281
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:44,860
they're more likely to be incinerated,

282
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,461
and then debt players can cause each other

283
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:48,322
to become unstable.

284
00:13:48,982 --> 00:13:51,563
In this way, each of these very simple pieces,

285
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,624
one after the other, is getting us to a place

286
00:13:53,644 --> 00:13:55,325
where we have a very rich story.

287
00:13:55,365 --> 00:13:56,706
Blaseball is all about kissing.

288
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:59,640
Keep introducing simple systems.

289
00:14:01,522 --> 00:14:03,143
Let's talk about how this works on a typical week.

290
00:14:03,183 --> 00:14:05,445
It's Monday, well except it's actually Sunday

291
00:14:06,386 --> 00:14:07,867
because that's when the election happens

292
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,989
so it's really important to know

293
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:12,511
what the new fan input is going to be.

294
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:14,153
We pay a lot of attention on Sundays.

295
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:15,514
Are there new storylines?

296
00:14:15,574 --> 00:14:17,275
Are there new introductions of systems?

297
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:18,716
Are there things we didn't anticipate?

298
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:21,499
Does some player now have multiple modifications

299
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:23,540
that will work together in some unexpected way?

300
00:14:23,921 --> 00:14:25,522
How did our life get complicated?

301
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:32,412
Then we have an idea of where we want to go, and maybe we have a very clear, specific idea of where we want to go.

302
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:38,454
Just going to give a little bit more context for the forbidden book. This is the actual text.

303
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:47,616
In the early days, Joel was prototyping the game and really allowing the development to be sort of completely driven because all the fans were the internal developers.

304
00:14:48,897 --> 00:14:52,638
So we needed to introduce this choice when we finally got to it being live. How are we going

305
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:57,079
to introduce this system? We chose to do it by a mystery box and we assumed well that's a pretty

306
00:14:57,099 --> 00:15:02,001
juicy mystery box. So the fans chose to open the forbidden book. We had a very clear idea of the

307
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:06,542
outcome. The sim incinerated the players and all together we told the story of Blaseball.

308
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:08,407
That's great.

309
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:09,808
When we're doing a good job,

310
00:15:09,848 --> 00:15:11,609
we have a big stack of simple systems

311
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:13,470
that's driving the narrative forward

312
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,750
in collaboration with the fans.

313
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,772
Everything makes sense on its own,

314
00:15:17,032 --> 00:15:18,252
and the part that's really fun

315
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:19,953
is imagining how this is gonna play out

316
00:15:19,993 --> 00:15:21,014
when they're all stacked together.

317
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:24,716
We go into it with this sense of being incredibly flexible

318
00:15:24,776 --> 00:15:27,117
and embracing the wild ideas that we or the fans have,

319
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:30,239
but I don't know, that was really quick, right?

320
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:32,220
Can you remember everything I just said?

321
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,101
I probably can't.

322
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:35,742
Sometimes it's too much.

323
00:15:37,305 --> 00:15:38,766
And we really want the moment-to-moment

324
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:40,287
and big takeaways to feel cohesive.

325
00:15:40,727 --> 00:15:42,629
It's why I structured the talk in this way,

326
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:44,570
to try and overwhelm you with information

327
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,231
so that you would understand better

328
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,432
what it's like to play blazeball.

329
00:15:49,393 --> 00:15:51,435
Eventually the stacking systems get too complicated

330
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:53,476
and we need to cut some away.

331
00:15:53,957 --> 00:15:57,699
But if any of you are narrative designers or storytellers,

332
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,160
taking away player mechanics

333
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,142
is probably the least popular thing you can do,

334
00:16:01,162 --> 00:16:02,463
so you really need to adjust it

335
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:03,784
from a narrative perspective.

336
00:16:04,653 --> 00:16:07,876
Another mistake I would say we made is leaning into team stories.

337
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:13,741
If all 24 teams are trying to achieve a specific goal, well, we have 24 threads going at once,

338
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:18,685
and that's too many. So we want to try and simplify things, get back to the place where

339
00:16:18,705 --> 00:16:22,268
we are, running one main story that's easy to communicate to your friends.

340
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,173
Ultimately, it's about building tools that allow the cool stories

341
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:30,575
that come out of Blaseball to be communicated to each other.

342
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:46,151
All right.

343
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:48,493
Hi there.

344
00:16:50,434 --> 00:16:52,315
My name is Vince Diamante and

345
00:16:54,337 --> 00:16:55,498
where's the thing here?

346
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:56,058
Here we go.

347
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:03,583
All right.

348
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:06,225
Hi, yeah, my name is Vince Diamante.

349
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:07,986
I do not want to do Camtasia.

350
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:12,492
I think I did that right.

351
00:17:12,872 --> 00:17:16,134
Cool. This is the Sky Children of the Light music micro post-mortem.

352
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:23,259
Quick intro. Sky Children of the Light is a multiplayer social online game

353
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:27,482
where players engage in acts of friendship and compassion and kindness.

354
00:17:28,703 --> 00:17:31,405
while exploring a beautiful and mysterious world.

355
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,167
We've been working on this game for a while now,

356
00:17:34,727 --> 00:17:37,530
and by a while I mean really, really freaking long.

357
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,891
It started out in 2012.

358
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:41,413
You might have seen that we announced

359
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:43,574
that it was gonna be in beta in 2017,

360
00:17:44,095 --> 00:17:46,657
and we beta tested for a long time, two years,

361
00:17:47,097 --> 00:17:49,559
before we eventually got to a global release in July 2019.

362
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,042
And I've been with that game company for that entire time.

363
00:17:53,642 --> 00:17:56,946
since 2012. I was the audio director all the way up to 2019.

364
00:17:57,106 --> 00:18:00,210
And then once we globally launched, I'm like, OK, maybe I can relax a bit.

365
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,112
I'll just be the music composer for a while.

366
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:04,515
And that's what I'm doing right now.

367
00:18:04,655 --> 00:18:06,958
Is that a good idea?

368
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:07,479
Well, we'll see.

369
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,241
Anyways.

370
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:15,898
Sky really is sort of a story of a couple of different games and different workflows that

371
00:18:15,939 --> 00:18:21,061
went into it because 2012 was really weird when it came to the mobile space. You know,

372
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:25,543
some people think, wow, mobile games, it's like this monolithic thing. It's actually changed a

373
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:31,286
whole hell of a lot. Back then we were thinking, oh wow, Journey came out and it was pretty good

374
00:18:31,366 --> 00:18:33,968
and let's do something with that in mobile.

375
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:38,791
we can sell a game for 99 cents, 2.99, whatever, on the App Store.

376
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:43,995
That wasn't working after a couple of years, so we had to change that. We had to change what we

377
00:18:44,015 --> 00:18:48,698
were selling. We had to change the structure of that, which ultimately meant we were changing

378
00:18:48,738 --> 00:18:54,543
what the game was. And I was actually really struggling to deal with that, because for the

379
00:18:54,663 --> 00:18:57,104
most part, I was being a very...

380
00:18:59,002 --> 00:19:02,624
artistic audio director. I was just hanging out and being like,

381
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:08,267
hey, level designer, what are you doing? Let me make something really cool for this level.

382
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:13,909
Or if someone had a cool mechanic, I would say, yeah, let me make the sound of flying.

383
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:17,451
Maybe make the cool music and the rhythm of flying and all that.

384
00:19:19,337 --> 00:19:26,740
It was a really cool exploration process for me for those first four or five years of stuff.

385
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:32,482
And all throughout that time, I was very aware of what that game company was before that,

386
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:36,884
Flow, Flower, and Journey. Yes, Journey did have that multiplayer component,

387
00:19:36,924 --> 00:19:41,426
but it was a very limited component. And really, the other thing that was there

388
00:19:41,586 --> 00:19:47,389
was that very important, very solid narrative arc that brought you through that experience.

389
00:19:48,209 --> 00:19:49,610
And how do you define that?

390
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:51,031
Well, it's the series of moments,

391
00:19:51,071 --> 00:19:53,171
series of set pieces that we've got there.

392
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:56,413
Oh yeah, you finally have that vertical sequence

393
00:19:56,713 --> 00:19:58,754
through that underground temple and journey.

394
00:19:58,794 --> 00:20:02,596
Yeah, set pieces, moments, let's score those things.

395
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:04,116
So for me as a music composer,

396
00:20:04,557 --> 00:20:07,358
I was definitely thinking about hitting those moments

397
00:20:07,398 --> 00:20:08,458
in a really solid way,

398
00:20:08,578 --> 00:20:09,879
making things that were beautiful

399
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:12,080
along this particular trajectory.

400
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,961
So yeah, making sure that there was an awesome soundtrack

401
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:16,822
for that single player story campaign experience.

402
00:20:17,362 --> 00:20:23,026
But in addition to that, we really wanted to make a robust online multiplayer experience,

403
00:20:23,126 --> 00:20:27,269
not just, oh, someone might drop in into your game and then you could go to the end.

404
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:33,514
There's going to be more multiplayer, four people, eight people, maybe even more than that,

405
00:20:33,574 --> 00:20:39,037
that you join in and these more along the lines of an MMO instanced experience.

406
00:20:40,218 --> 00:20:44,081
And these guys would come into the world and do different things.

407
00:20:45,301 --> 00:20:51,523
And for me as a music composer, I was thinking, how do I actually rectify what the music is that's going to be playing at any given time?

408
00:20:51,923 --> 00:20:56,905
Someone wants their emotional story experience, their interacting with this really cool NPC,

409
00:20:57,425 --> 00:21:02,287
and then they get smashed into an instance with a couple of people that are just, uh...

410
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,828
goofing around and doing silly tricks.

411
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:07,629
Some of you who've played Journey might know about

412
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,610
people who are into out-of-bouncing,

413
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,632
just doing really cool things with the weird level geometry.

414
00:21:13,012 --> 00:21:14,593
This also happens in this game too.

415
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:16,033
Hey, they just want to have fun.

416
00:21:16,053 --> 00:21:17,234
They want to play around with this.

417
00:21:17,634 --> 00:21:19,995
How does that actually jive with what's going on

418
00:21:20,035 --> 00:21:21,395
with these players that are playing the story?

419
00:21:22,676 --> 00:21:25,057
And we didn't really have a good answer to that,

420
00:21:25,177 --> 00:21:27,318
except maybe let's just make some tech

421
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:28,759
in order to try to deal with that.

422
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,980
That is not the.

423
00:21:33,169 --> 00:21:34,130
thing that I was looking for.

424
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:36,511
That's the wrong slide.

425
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:39,714
Uh, okay, so there's a missing music texture.

426
00:21:40,094 --> 00:21:40,694
Music tech.

427
00:21:41,355 --> 00:21:42,936
One of the cool things that we did

428
00:21:43,676 --> 00:21:46,858
was we have all these music callbacks that are in the game.

429
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,481
So I did all the music in Cakewalk Sonar

430
00:21:52,162 --> 00:21:54,283
until we got into Reaper, and I kept on using Reaper.

431
00:21:54,724 --> 00:21:57,405
Cool thing with Reaper is that you can do these things

432
00:21:57,485 --> 00:21:59,487
called re-scripts and script actions

433
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,328
where you run a script,

434
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:07,312
I'm reading MIDI note data, and then it can export these markers into the project,

435
00:22:07,732 --> 00:22:12,956
which I then exported into FMOD music events, which would give me some cool things.

436
00:22:14,197 --> 00:22:20,801
I could know at any point in the music what chord is being played, what the melody was,

437
00:22:20,982 --> 00:22:22,322
what the dynamic level was.

438
00:22:22,983 --> 00:22:28,605
and that was really useful because then I can jive the sound effects that are playing with

439
00:22:28,685 --> 00:22:34,207
the harmony and key center of the music that's going on and we made a pretty good decision early

440
00:22:34,407 --> 00:22:40,009
on to actually make this happen for all the music. So I was doing things in Cakewalk Sonar,

441
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:41,349
then I eventually did things in Reaper.

442
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:43,591
running rescripts, it was great.

443
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,453
There was a missing slide in here,

444
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,435
which is actually really important.

445
00:22:47,855 --> 00:22:48,676
I'll try to describe it.

446
00:22:49,457 --> 00:22:51,539
There were two other pieces of tech that we did

447
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:53,801
specifically for rectifying the different types

448
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:54,862
of music in the game.

449
00:22:55,703 --> 00:22:57,445
One of them is sync.

450
00:22:58,285 --> 00:23:04,030
So we can actually sync up what clients are actually playing and say,

451
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,833
hey, there's Music One that's playing on iPhone One.

452
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:12,037
OK, let's make sure that Music One is actually playing on all three, four,

453
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:16,140
eight iPhones at the same time, at the exact same point.

454
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,262
And it will sound really cool and awesome.

455
00:23:19,143 --> 00:23:24,750
Okay, but what if I don't want to do that? Then we introduce this idea of not just music background,

456
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:29,696
but also music foreground. So if someone is doing something elsewhere in the level,

457
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:34,803
like they go into a little nook, and they say, okay, I'm going to do this little side quest

458
00:23:34,823 --> 00:23:38,047
that's not related to the main story that you actually experience in that level.

459
00:23:38,887 --> 00:23:41,329
then you can experience music foreground.

460
00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:42,951
Maybe the music foreground is a stinger,

461
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:45,593
maybe the music foreground is actually a looping piece

462
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,115
of music that accompanies this particular quest,

463
00:23:48,515 --> 00:23:50,396
but they will have music foreground

464
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:52,858
and they can have their music not synced

465
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:55,340
with the other people that are experiencing stuff

466
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,981
in the single player campaign.

467
00:23:58,483 --> 00:24:04,510
And that's what we thought we needed because there was this clear divide between these different types of music.

468
00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:13,862
The music of the core narrative, where you would have cutscenes for experiencing the cool things that the elders of the world were actually showing you.

469
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,423
But then there were all the other things that came along the line.

470
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:23,465
Once we realized that we weren't just being a free-to-play, a premium game,

471
00:24:23,885 --> 00:24:28,085
we were being a social game, and this idea of seasons and events,

472
00:24:28,706 --> 00:24:32,586
then maybe that music is going to be stuff that consistently is foregrounded.

473
00:24:32,646 --> 00:24:36,067
So stuff like New Year's music, Valentine's music, things like that,

474
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:39,148
or even specific multiplayer situations and quests.

475
00:24:39,988 --> 00:24:44,834
So we're going to introduce a new space in the game that's specifically a flying arena.

476
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:49,620
All right, maybe that music is foregrounded, but it's also synced between all the players

477
00:24:49,661 --> 00:24:54,046
that actually want to play in that particular space. So hopefully I described that okay.

478
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,841
Ratios of music.

479
00:24:57,541 --> 00:25:00,982
So at global launch, there was about 100 megabytes of music,

480
00:25:01,002 --> 00:25:03,523
and 100 megabytes is after things were crunched down

481
00:25:03,643 --> 00:25:04,924
into the FMOD music banks,

482
00:25:05,604 --> 00:25:09,085
and the core narrative music was about 75 some megabytes,

483
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:11,366
and then everything else was the rest.

484
00:25:12,126 --> 00:25:14,287
Seasons, seasons, quests, and sheets,

485
00:25:14,787 --> 00:25:16,908
those basically correspond to the new stuff

486
00:25:17,288 --> 00:25:18,489
that would come along the line.

487
00:25:18,709 --> 00:25:21,530
There's stuff in there because we were beta testing

488
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,730
this idea of seasons.

489
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:26,533
from 2017 to 2019, and it seemed pretty cool.

490
00:25:27,113 --> 00:25:28,094
We kept on going with that.

491
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:30,736
And so now we're on 14 seasons

492
00:25:30,976 --> 00:25:33,858
and the core narrative music is still there,

493
00:25:33,938 --> 00:25:36,600
still 70-some with a few more here and there,

494
00:25:37,481 --> 00:25:39,662
but now the music bank size is huge.

495
00:25:39,702 --> 00:25:41,464
It's 250 megabytes compressed

496
00:25:42,724 --> 00:25:45,947
and it's actually really crappy quality, but that's okay.

497
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:48,248
You know, it's an iPhone.

498
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,650
Ratios of music, another way of looking at it is

499
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:56,974
There have so far been three albums released. Volume 1, which is about a CD worth, is that

500
00:25:57,014 --> 00:26:02,598
core narrative music. Volume 2 is events and situations, and Volume 3 is seasonal.

501
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,659
There's a lot of music in this game.

502
00:26:06,108 --> 00:26:09,931
But I put a whole lot of work into that core narrative stuff.

503
00:26:10,632 --> 00:26:13,214
40% of the core narrative music is live orchestral.

504
00:26:13,414 --> 00:26:15,176
And just to throw some numbers out there,

505
00:26:16,177 --> 00:26:17,398
we booked an orchestra.

506
00:26:17,498 --> 00:26:19,720
It's the Fames Orchestra in Macedonia.

507
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,481
47-piece orchestra.

508
00:26:22,442 --> 00:26:26,264
We recorded for six hours, 30 minutes of music recorded with that.

509
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:27,484
8,000 euros.

510
00:26:28,725 --> 00:26:32,787
This was definitely on the low end and actually kind of affordable

511
00:26:33,147 --> 00:26:36,409
if any of you are interested in doing that stuff, whether you're a musician or not.

512
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:41,011
8,000 euros, it's still pretty accurate, even though these are 2018-2019 numbers.

513
00:26:41,591 --> 00:26:45,193
The rest of the music was synth or synth and live solo,

514
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:48,695
just like a single soloist, like a single flute or whatnot.

515
00:26:48,855 --> 00:26:51,176
And as we continue to do this seasonal music...

516
00:26:51,656 --> 00:26:58,141
that's what we did. And we had to keep on going with that. So we're on 14 seasons right now.

517
00:26:58,862 --> 00:27:04,226
It's been between 5 and 30 minutes of new music for each season. So we're doing new areas,

518
00:27:04,326 --> 00:27:10,251
new side stories, and often really new mechanics. So we're going to expand the flying mechanics.

519
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:15,975
We're going to go crazy and let you swim underwater and stuff like that. And these

520
00:27:16,015 --> 00:27:20,018
things are happening at a regular clip. New seasons are basically dropping every two to three months.

521
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:25,924
and there's time pressures there. So 30 minutes of music, and it's one thing to be like, okay,

522
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:30,828
I can do 30 minutes of music for this new flight season, and then, oh wait, there's 30 minutes of

523
00:27:30,868 --> 00:27:36,673
music for these new mechanics, and 30 minutes, okay. It can be really tough to just keep that

524
00:27:36,873 --> 00:27:42,759
up, so we're definitely not going with live orchestra for all that. Now, the thing that

525
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:46,222
kind of frustrated me on reflection with that is that...

526
00:27:48,105 --> 00:27:50,306
no one cares about the core narrative music anymore.

527
00:27:50,346 --> 00:27:52,528
And we put so much effort into that.

528
00:27:52,568 --> 00:27:54,048
You know, you got the orchestra

529
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:56,189
and I spent besides that cost there,

530
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:57,370
there's also the other stuff.

531
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:00,472
Okay, the time that I need in order to actually create

532
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,133
all the scores for people to read and prepare that

533
00:28:03,173 --> 00:28:07,215
and dealing with the music orchestra coordinator

534
00:28:07,755 --> 00:28:08,416
and whatnot.

535
00:28:09,016 --> 00:28:12,558
It's really tough, sort of that feeling there.

536
00:28:13,478 --> 00:28:14,859
Players love the new music

537
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:17,260
that wasn't actually polished the same way.

538
00:28:18,626 --> 00:28:20,749
But honestly, it's alright.

539
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:28,159
I should have realized, because of the differences between the music that I was making, as well

540
00:28:28,199 --> 00:28:31,803
as the needs of the music, and I think this thing's not playing because it's a PowerPoint.

541
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:38,082
Whatever, we got these two game soundtracks, and they're sort of fulfilling different functions.

542
00:28:38,882 --> 00:28:44,064
There's the music that we worked on and we polished, and actually was really important from a marketing perspective

543
00:28:44,404 --> 00:28:49,385
and part of communicating to people, not just potential players, but to everyone else in the world,

544
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:52,866
hey, we care about this game, we are polishing this game.

545
00:28:52,886 --> 00:28:55,227
There's that marketing and promotional value.

546
00:28:55,627 --> 00:28:58,628
Sometimes it's really important to just have that bullet point there.

547
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:05,751
and that's great to a certain extent. And then the game comes out and it's really so much more

548
00:29:05,891 --> 00:29:11,134
about the player connection, connecting with the mechanics, even if I'm not polishing the

549
00:29:11,194 --> 00:29:15,856
music the same way because we don't have the time or the money to actually deal with an orchestra.

550
00:29:16,396 --> 00:29:21,941
it's so connected to those game mechanics. I'm not thinking, oh, I want to make this cutscene

551
00:29:22,121 --> 00:29:26,764
awesome. I should have really thought about that question before. Who cares about this cutscene?

552
00:29:26,885 --> 00:29:31,708
You know, 45 seconds in a single-player campaign. It just sort of came to mind. It's like, oh yeah,

553
00:29:31,748 --> 00:29:35,752
of course that's what I do. I know about the cutscene, so I'll polish them. Instead, it's...

554
00:29:36,552 --> 00:29:41,654
Oh right, people care about what is going to be this new sound of swimming underwater.

555
00:29:42,134 --> 00:29:46,376
I need to make sure that I create a musical experience that properly correlates with that.

556
00:29:46,836 --> 00:29:51,358
And players responded to that. They don't care if there's no orchestra there, they don't care if

557
00:29:51,658 --> 00:29:57,060
we're not polishing that, but that connection and making sure that what I'm doing as a music

558
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:03,183
composer is properly motivated by the things that players actually care about, that's really what's

559
00:30:03,223 --> 00:30:03,863
important there.

560
00:30:05,695 --> 00:30:10,439
So yeah, if you have any questions, feel free to email me. I'm also on Twitter. And thanks.

561
00:30:17,923 --> 00:30:19,344
I think yours is over here.

562
00:30:23,067 --> 00:30:30,952
So I'm Zoliver Nelson Jr. I do a lot of stuff. And I've eaten at Denny's four times in the last

563
00:30:30,992 --> 00:30:33,894
three days. So if I'm not entirely lucid, blame the Denny's Corporation.

564
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,571
I've worked on over 60 games in the past six years.

565
00:30:39,392 --> 00:30:44,878
I was a journalist once upon a time, including running a column for PC Gamer Magazine for

566
00:30:44,938 --> 00:30:45,439
two years.

567
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:47,942
I've worked in RPGs and print.

568
00:30:47,962 --> 00:30:48,803
I've written comics.

569
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,828
I used to go around the world wearing Jeff Goldblum masks for non-criminal purposes.

570
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:54,510
This is a...

571
00:30:55,532 --> 00:31:00,080
post-mortem of one of my latest games, Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator,

572
00:31:00,861 --> 00:31:03,886
and it's going to run a little bit different than a formal post-mortem for

573
00:31:03,906 --> 00:31:06,070
some reasons we're about to go into. First...

574
00:31:07,245 --> 00:31:12,490
What Space World Organ Training Simulator is, is a sci-fi body horror market tycoon.

575
00:31:13,311 --> 00:31:16,634
You know, because that's a breakout genre that everybody needs.

576
00:31:16,714 --> 00:31:17,995
It's really hot right now on Steam.

577
00:31:19,076 --> 00:31:23,500
It revolves around the one thing everyone has, wants, and needs in a strange and evolving universe.

578
00:31:24,261 --> 00:31:24,561
Organs.

579
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:30,711
This has been the cause of an existential crisis.

580
00:31:31,272 --> 00:31:34,594
Because when you're making games that are idiosyncratic,

581
00:31:35,315 --> 00:31:37,796
people treat you as a monolith.

582
00:31:37,957 --> 00:31:39,278
Like you are making these games alone

583
00:31:39,318 --> 00:31:42,740
instead of actively enabled by a team

584
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,142
to create singular visions and bring them to life

585
00:31:45,662 --> 00:31:48,044
in an ambitious and expansive way.

586
00:31:48,704 --> 00:31:51,066
And it's fucked, frankly.

587
00:31:52,527 --> 00:31:52,827
So, uh...

588
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,823
I want to talk about how our studio works, if only because people all week have been

589
00:31:58,863 --> 00:32:03,285
saying, how do you do what you do, and why did you do that to your body at Denny's?

590
00:32:05,826 --> 00:32:08,468
Strange Scaffold uses something I call the constellation model.

591
00:32:08,508 --> 00:32:16,252
Essentially, my work and purpose, not just as a creative director, but as a person, is

592
00:32:16,272 --> 00:32:19,794
to find ways to make games better, faster, cheaper, and healthier for the people who

593
00:32:20,274 --> 00:32:20,754
build them.

594
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:26,798
I create a singular vision, I act as a prism and filter for bringing that vision to life.

595
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:32,421
But my job from there is to enable and empower the people around me to do the best work possible

596
00:32:32,481 --> 00:32:35,723
in a healthy environment and see themselves inside the game they create.

597
00:32:35,783 --> 00:32:42,547
I assemble a team, and from each person, collect the specific things we need to bring that

598
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:43,227
vision to life.

599
00:32:43,347 --> 00:32:44,368
And from that point...

600
00:32:45,584 --> 00:32:47,425
When their work is done, they're done.

601
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,405
We might work with them and connect the dots

602
00:32:49,545 --> 00:32:51,326
in a different configuration for another project.

603
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:53,247
If there's a specific need that arises

604
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:55,087
on a different project, they can come and address it.

605
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:57,188
They might Voltron off and do their own thing.

606
00:32:57,528 --> 00:32:59,248
But essentially creating this wider cloud

607
00:32:59,288 --> 00:33:01,789
and constellation of collaborators

608
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:03,510
ensures that we can have

609
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:08,894
really personal games that still exist on a micro-budget scale,

610
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:13,878
and that emphasize the human health of the people who build the games more so than the projects themselves.

611
00:33:14,238 --> 00:33:18,001
Because I would rather build a bad game well,

612
00:33:18,482 --> 00:33:21,684
than make a great game in a way that destroys a single human life.

613
00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:24,907
uh... this is guided by a few

614
00:33:25,788 --> 00:33:27,548
key phrases behind our studio

615
00:33:27,568 --> 00:33:29,589
uh... but one of them is just frankly

616
00:33:29,949 --> 00:33:33,610
we want to provide a fair compensation for the most flexible interesting work

617
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,130
you can do

618
00:33:34,691 --> 00:33:35,591
at a given time

619
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:38,992
one of the jokes we have inside the studios that we rehabilitate seniors

620
00:33:39,132 --> 00:33:40,553
because when you've been working

621
00:33:41,013 --> 00:33:42,633
on the same game for five years

622
00:33:42,653 --> 00:33:44,994
uh... under shall we say

623
00:33:45,835 --> 00:33:47,335
not charitable circumstances

624
00:33:48,175 --> 00:33:52,959
being told, hey, do you want to make a game about organs and be treated fairly and join a team where

625
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:58,223
even if something arises in your life, there will be other people who can support you in specific

626
00:33:58,243 --> 00:34:07,009
and individual ways. It feels like a breath of fresh air. And we can talk about how the game did,

627
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:11,953
but we were next to Halo for like game pass. It did well. Okay. It got.

628
00:34:17,502 --> 00:34:23,263
It got very flattering and frankly surprising critical and commercial attention.

629
00:34:23,283 --> 00:34:27,644
It earned back its development costs, even putting aside the Game Pass deal very quickly.

630
00:34:28,464 --> 00:34:32,785
It did not sell mega hits, but it is profitable and sustainable.

631
00:34:32,825 --> 00:34:37,426
And the people who made the game have gone on to both continue to work with the studio

632
00:34:37,466 --> 00:34:41,687
and make their own things in a way that preserved their creativity and humanity,

633
00:34:41,807 --> 00:34:43,667
which is our purpose for existing.

634
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:45,868
But through all of this.

635
00:34:48,147 --> 00:34:49,888
people are acting like this was my game.

636
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:53,291
And I am not going to downplay my own capabilities

637
00:34:53,351 --> 00:34:56,132
as a creator or my role in maintaining that vision,

638
00:34:56,633 --> 00:34:58,314
but I don't make games alone,

639
00:34:58,454 --> 00:34:59,655
and I don't think I would enjoy it.

640
00:35:00,155 --> 00:35:02,056
So how we're going to structure this talk

641
00:35:02,116 --> 00:35:04,678
is I'm gonna basically take you through our credits list

642
00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:08,621
and con GDC into giving me a several thousand dollar pass

643
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:11,543
so I can do an ad for all of the incredible people

644
00:35:11,583 --> 00:35:15,785
I worked with and how inside of this vision that is mine,

645
00:35:16,746 --> 00:35:22,031
you can see the individual people who worked on it and their perspective in bringing that game to

646
00:35:22,091 --> 00:35:29,317
life. First, I want to talk about Sam Chayot. He is our programmer. He's the reason why this

647
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:30,619
game works on a Kinect in 2022.

648
00:35:38,565 --> 00:35:44,230
As you can see here, Sam has a deep distrust of the Unity engine, and so he scaled our

649
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:49,174
actual screen space to be the size of several football fields, so we could just drop in

650
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:51,736
sprites and not tell Unity shit.

651
00:35:54,500 --> 00:36:15,901
His perspective on, again, making games better, faster, cheaper, and healthier, and creating collaborative tools means we can make anything, any major piece of content in a game within two to five minutes, and it's created in a workflow that is itself joyful, because the process of making games should be as much of a joy, if not more so of a joy, than playing them.

652
00:36:17,686 --> 00:36:21,309
We have Ben Chandler, who when I was originating the concept,

653
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:24,693
I said, hey, how does this even look?

654
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:26,735
I had this idea in my head, is that pixel art?

655
00:36:26,815 --> 00:36:28,496
Is this, what is this?

656
00:36:29,517 --> 00:36:31,399
And then he dropped something that he should have fairly

657
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:34,082
put a content warning in my inbox and said,

658
00:36:34,382 --> 00:36:35,243
does it look like this?

659
00:36:36,083 --> 00:36:38,326
And I said, yeah, yeah, Ben, it does.

660
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:53,802
Uh, Ben Chandler has a way of seeing worlds and of rapidly iterating on visual concepts that meant he fused 2D pixel art that's very strong in its identity with

661
00:36:54,789 --> 00:37:01,152
ray traced 3D engine graphics and stuck them into a single thing that looks like a cohesive whole.

662
00:37:01,232 --> 00:37:02,853
Ben was our audio director.

663
00:37:02,893 --> 00:37:10,656
Julia Minamata, our second artist on the team, created the pixel portraits that defined its world.

664
00:37:11,277 --> 00:37:15,979
And looking at the portraits of the game and how this has come together, you

665
00:37:17,264 --> 00:37:23,512
might see it as again a singular collaboration but actually two artists with very complimentary

666
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:27,477
but also divergent skill sets worked together to make something that looks like nothing else

667
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:33,304
out there. RJ Lake, our sound composer, created a dynamic soundtrack that nearly melted two computers.

668
00:37:34,765 --> 00:37:44,312
Uh, every single tab in the game has a different mix of a central theme that's being made that also has an escalating mix once your trading day begins.

669
00:37:44,772 --> 00:37:50,576
So we ended up making like four different mixes for eight different screens for every portion of the game.

670
00:37:51,176 --> 00:37:57,441
And in our roughly 20 gigabyte repo for the title, 19 gigabytes are sound files.

671
00:37:59,303 --> 00:38:06,166
RJ Lake is a madman and also someone with a priority on team health and on finding reasonable

672
00:38:06,186 --> 00:38:11,828
ways to bring things to life that even with the madness finds method to enable his collaborators

673
00:38:12,028 --> 00:38:14,189
and focus on the singular vision for the title.

674
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:16,810
Hunter Bond created this gif.

675
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:22,555
He is an artist.

676
00:38:22,575 --> 00:38:24,518
He used to be a carpenter.

677
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:26,981
He is now a marketing expert.

678
00:38:27,041 --> 00:38:30,987
And his insistence on supporting the team overall

679
00:38:31,027 --> 00:38:34,031
and to thinking and talking about how we can even.

680
00:38:34,872 --> 00:38:37,333
turned down opportunities to ensure that the team had

681
00:38:38,094 --> 00:38:42,876
useful time to preserve themselves as human beings and focus on larger press

682
00:38:42,936 --> 00:38:47,017
beats as part of the way this game came to be. Marketing is a

683
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:50,439
point as a part of the development team and anyone who tells you otherwise

684
00:38:50,919 --> 00:38:52,420
is either lying or ignorant.

685
00:38:57,712 --> 00:39:00,213
Judith McCrory, earlier in the development process,

686
00:39:00,253 --> 00:39:02,194
we said, hey, we made a game that looks like this.

687
00:39:02,254 --> 00:39:03,454
How do we turn it into key art?

688
00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:09,557
And Judith, taking her skills from Cartoon Network,

689
00:39:09,617 --> 00:39:11,979
among other places, found a way to translate this

690
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:14,380
into key art that defined the branding for the title.

691
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,621
Astralor Games, our QA team,

692
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,043
also a independent developer in their own right

693
00:39:20,063 --> 00:39:22,344
who understands the needs of independent development,

694
00:39:22,824 --> 00:39:24,385
QA is a part of the development team,

695
00:39:24,805 --> 00:39:26,406
came in and.

696
00:39:30,017 --> 00:39:36,119
introduced us to the glory that is Notion and organized the issues and points of feedback

697
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:40,060
that could be brought into our title in a way that revolutionized several parts of the game,

698
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,121
even right up to the point before release, to make sure that we brought the best experience

699
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:49,003
to players possible. And finally, we have our producers.

700
00:39:49,363 --> 00:39:51,885
Not finally, a lot of people worked on this game

701
00:39:52,305 --> 00:39:56,329
in multiple small ways that no matter what their size was,

702
00:39:56,649 --> 00:39:58,811
allowed this thing to be what it is.

703
00:40:00,593 --> 00:40:03,435
Tanya and Meredith Hall are producers

704
00:40:03,495 --> 00:40:05,217
that came in near the end of the project.

705
00:40:05,938 --> 00:40:08,760
And part of the reason they did is because

706
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,662
this is a game called Witch Strandings.

707
00:40:11,002 --> 00:40:12,524
We made it in the middle of making

708
00:40:12,584 --> 00:40:14,585
Space Warlord Organ Training Simulator because

709
00:40:15,306 --> 00:40:22,650
were a little bit crazy. And because of the way in which we work, that game isn't completely

710
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:27,192
finished yet. It's 95% finished and we were just waiting for the final pieces of content

711
00:40:27,212 --> 00:40:32,214
to go in. And I kind of forgot to tell Sam to finish Space Warlord for three months.

712
00:40:34,316 --> 00:40:35,676
Having other people in the room.

713
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:41,699
to advocate for the development team and to see where the wheels are turning and who can be

714
00:40:41,779 --> 00:40:48,982
unblocked and supported is essential to not just the game but the studio as a whole becoming a

715
00:40:49,062 --> 00:40:55,344
better place. Tom Vanita created a tutorial for an airport for aliens currently run by dogs that was

716
00:40:56,185 --> 00:41:03,828
like completed by over 90% of our players and I said I've never made anything with a spreadsheet

717
00:41:03,848 --> 00:41:04,688
before and I'm scared.

718
00:41:05,248 --> 00:41:25,976
He came in near the end of the development cycle and provided a template for how to consider a game from a spreadsheet perspective that allowed us to create the content that led to the final version of Space World at Oregon Trading Simulator and something that looks reasonably balanced, even though this game, much like capitalism, is deeply broken.

719
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:33,917
And finally, uh, not finally, lots of people, Maxi Molina, uh, made our steam graphics.

720
00:41:34,317 --> 00:41:37,458
We were tired after finishing the game, even with an emphasis on team health.

721
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,360
And I said, please someone make our steam graphics.

722
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:46,762
And Maxi Molina took the various pieces of art from the game, including making

723
00:41:46,822 --> 00:41:50,823
some new pieces to allow us to create among other things, a.

724
00:41:52,121 --> 00:41:58,189
real money simulacrum using the steam trading card market of an organ trading market.

725
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:06,256
It turns out the human soul plummeted in value very quickly, which might be a commentary on Steam itself.

726
00:42:08,098 --> 00:42:14,123
And Maximalina enabled all of that during a time when we were too exhausted to pull together such assets ourselves.

727
00:42:14,163 --> 00:42:22,490
And finally, Alex Rose, a prolific indie game developer of his own right, worked on Super Red Rude Bear Resurrection.

728
00:42:23,872 --> 00:42:30,099
We were coming hot into our release zone, dealing with some final things with Xbox cert, and I said,

729
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:37,848
Alex, please save us. And he did. He parachuted into the team and with a few points of expertise

730
00:42:37,948 --> 00:42:43,714
allowed us to not just meet our date, but exceed it and have the game ready early.

731
00:42:45,949 --> 00:42:49,730
There is a narrative in games that,

732
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:55,171
as much as we attempt to dethrone the auteur establishment,

733
00:42:55,711 --> 00:42:57,452
continues to valorize people

734
00:42:57,552 --> 00:43:00,812
who single-handedly build projects.

735
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:04,693
And it's a lie, and we're partially responsible for it

736
00:43:04,813 --> 00:43:05,713
on a cultural level.

737
00:43:06,394 --> 00:43:09,034
We say we want games that emphasize

738
00:43:09,114 --> 00:43:10,415
and support the teams that build them,

739
00:43:10,735 --> 00:43:13,575
and then take singular figureheads and make them into gods.

740
00:43:15,137 --> 00:43:19,359
This game and my career is proof that so-called auteur games

741
00:43:19,379 --> 00:43:22,280
with a singular vision are made better when they visibly

742
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,141
display the contributions, identities, and priorities

743
00:43:25,241 --> 00:43:26,162
of their collaborators.

744
00:43:27,282 --> 00:43:30,043
And if you take anything else away from this talk,

745
00:43:30,844 --> 00:43:34,125
it's that time and time again, the people who

746
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:36,847
contributed to this thing and solved problems that

747
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:40,328
allowed us to release this game emerged

748
00:43:40,348 --> 00:43:41,709
from pre-existing relationships.

749
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:53,581
If I had this game as my first game and attempted to go into the breach, I might have smashed myself against the wall of reality in the process.

750
00:43:54,783 --> 00:44:00,428
Your first game is not your worst game, but your best game is your next game.

751
00:44:00,749 --> 00:44:03,551
And I didn't intend this section to have so much rhyming, but here we are.

752
00:44:05,073 --> 00:44:10,876
You survive in video games by surviving, by shipping what you have and moving on to the next title,

753
00:44:11,236 --> 00:44:14,298
and saying that no matter what is in your hands,

754
00:44:15,699 --> 00:44:20,641
the people around you are more important than the subjective value of the product.

755
00:44:22,066 --> 00:44:25,830
The more we nurture our relationships and our medium

756
00:44:26,671 --> 00:44:28,333
with the collaborators we're surrounded by,

757
00:44:28,673 --> 00:44:30,075
the better our games will become.

758
00:44:30,255 --> 00:44:32,698
And I think that is particularly evident

759
00:44:32,738 --> 00:44:35,281
in the growth of the medium is seeing right now.

760
00:44:36,302 --> 00:44:40,567
I don't make games alone, but the games that I make.

761
00:44:41,609 --> 00:44:46,770
feel like me because of dozens of collaborators,

762
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:50,691
seen and unseen, who make my work possible

763
00:44:51,111 --> 00:44:52,732
and who believe in a better medium.

764
00:44:53,212 --> 00:44:56,053
And if you are here today and believe in a better medium,

765
00:44:56,673 --> 00:44:59,133
I encourage you, look for the ways

766
00:44:59,173 --> 00:45:03,074
that you can not just treat your collaborators well,

767
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:05,055
but uplift their voices in your process

768
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:09,156
because your vision will become stronger as a result.

769
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:10,176
Thank you.

770
00:45:25,286 --> 00:45:32,850
Okay, we have six minutes for questions if anybody's got any questions, but there's also a wrap-up zone

771
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:37,693
that we can go to after this. But if anyone does have questions for any of the panelists,

772
00:45:37,733 --> 00:45:42,976
you can go to one of these two mics and ask it there from.

773
00:45:42,996 --> 00:45:49,699
And if we don't, we can all go home and sleep forever.

774
00:45:51,801 --> 00:45:53,361
Please let us escape GDC.

775
00:45:56,508 --> 00:45:57,769
I will not let you escape.

776
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:04,372
What kind of difficulties did you face getting the Kinect up and running on a modern game?

777
00:46:05,892 --> 00:46:13,255
One of them is that we ended up outracing the end of life for Xbox's Kinect.

778
00:46:13,315 --> 00:46:18,258
I think it got revealed a little bit ago that all of its drivers are about to be sunset,

779
00:46:18,798 --> 00:46:22,580
which is great when you've made the Kinect a critical piece of your marketing for over a year.

780
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,521
Ready?

781
00:46:27,369 --> 00:46:31,269
So I was curious to your point where you're talking about how

782
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:35,550
You need to uplift and identify and celebrate your collaborators

783
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:41,432
Just how do you yeah, what's the best way to find those collaborators in the first place?

784
00:46:41,472 --> 00:46:43,212
like especially if you're just starting out and

785
00:46:44,792 --> 00:46:51,814
You don't really know who you need or what you need for your game. Just how do you know who to look for?

786
00:46:53,715 --> 00:47:00,860
Look for people who share your perspective and who can communicate and believe in the

787
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,022
health of their collaborators first and foremost.

788
00:47:03,442 --> 00:47:05,104
You can teach and cultivate skills.

789
00:47:05,144 --> 00:47:10,088
You can go into a different area of development entirely, but what you can't teach is a human

790
00:47:10,108 --> 00:47:11,649
being to care about another human being.

791
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:16,813
Or at the very least, teaching that might be a much more involved process than is possible

792
00:47:16,873 --> 00:47:18,214
over a single development cycle.

793
00:47:18,334 --> 00:47:19,815
So look for the people around you who...

794
00:47:20,748 --> 00:47:26,233
have a rad perspective and are actively seeking to not just improve themselves but to create

795
00:47:26,293 --> 00:47:31,397
better conditions for their collaborators. I hire a lot of people these days and no matter

796
00:47:31,437 --> 00:47:35,301
what the skill set of the collaborator, I haven't failed with that methodology yet.

797
00:47:36,322 --> 00:47:39,365
Thank you. By the way, you all can answer too.

798
00:47:39,813 --> 00:47:44,495
Yeah, one thing to add to that, which is you should work with the people who make you the most excited.

799
00:47:44,575 --> 00:47:49,996
When you see yourself being reflected back to you in the creative output of someone else,

800
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:53,097
that's the best situation you can be in.

801
00:47:53,137 --> 00:47:56,658
And those are the people that you want to hold close to your heart and pay.

802
00:47:57,678 --> 00:48:01,800
Yeah, I've got a quick addition to that as well, which is basically piggybacking off of that.

803
00:48:03,588 --> 00:48:09,554
I've had multiple times where I'm like, I wish I could do something that looked like X,

804
00:48:09,834 --> 00:48:13,217
or I wish I could work with a composer that sounded like Y.

805
00:48:13,898 --> 00:48:17,801
And then I might, the gears click another couple times, and I was like,

806
00:48:17,841 --> 00:48:19,222
wait, why don't I just ask them?

807
00:48:21,017 --> 00:48:22,677
And that has worked so many times.

808
00:48:23,078 --> 00:48:25,719
So, uh, okay.

809
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:26,779
Go right on.

810
00:48:26,799 --> 00:48:28,140
I have two questions.

811
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:35,382
One is, as a flagellant designer, how do I practice the dark sorcery called spreadsheets?

812
00:48:36,703 --> 00:48:37,163
Oh, man.

813
00:48:38,103 --> 00:48:41,945
Yeah, like, uh, there are a lot of tutorials online.

814
00:48:42,165 --> 00:48:42,905
Like, genuinely.

815
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:48,540
The key I think is knowing the specific problem.

816
00:48:48,641 --> 00:48:50,867
Like that's always the part that helps the most with spreadsheets

817
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,071
because ultimately it's just.

818
00:48:53,103 --> 00:48:54,644
a dumb way to do programming.

819
00:48:55,044 --> 00:48:58,085
It's the only way I know how to do programming as well,

820
00:48:58,145 --> 00:48:58,985
so I'm not knocking it.

821
00:49:00,086 --> 00:49:02,967
But if you know, if you can very clearly define

822
00:49:03,007 --> 00:49:03,907
the problem that you want,

823
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:06,669
then you can get to the end of your expertise

824
00:49:06,869 --> 00:49:08,949
and figure out what question do I need to go ask

825
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:11,991
the infinite sized pool of knowledge

826
00:49:12,011 --> 00:49:14,152
that exists around spreadsheets to improve on.

827
00:49:15,072 --> 00:49:16,913
Sort of general knowledge isn't that helpful, but.

828
00:49:17,293 --> 00:49:20,855
if you can find, oh man, VLOOKUP solved my problem,

829
00:49:21,195 --> 00:49:22,416
you've really improved yourself

830
00:49:22,476 --> 00:49:24,017
as someone who is using expressions.

831
00:49:24,597 --> 00:49:27,579
And two is, who's going to Denny's tonight?

832
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:29,340
I'm not.

833
00:49:30,661 --> 00:49:31,021
Nobody.

834
00:49:31,522 --> 00:49:32,962
The cycle has to be completed.

835
00:49:32,982 --> 00:49:37,065
I really want another panookie.

836
00:49:39,566 --> 00:49:40,567
Okay, over here.

837
00:49:41,657 --> 00:49:43,158
Oh, yeah, so hello.

838
00:49:44,178 --> 00:49:45,299
After watching these micro talks,

839
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:47,760
I have two main questions in my mind.

840
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,122
The first of which is, what the hell is Blaseball?

841
00:49:51,502 --> 00:49:52,723
I need to see this.

842
00:49:54,683 --> 00:49:56,644
I hadn't heard about it before, and now I'm very interested.

843
00:49:58,205 --> 00:50:01,967
And my second of which is for the Denny's guy.

844
00:50:01,987 --> 00:50:02,947
So.

845
00:50:03,047 --> 00:50:03,187
So.

846
00:50:03,207 --> 00:50:03,248
So.

847
00:50:03,268 --> 00:50:03,368
So.

848
00:50:03,388 --> 00:50:03,488
So.

849
00:50:07,947 --> 00:50:22,471
So my question is, you talked about this constellation model and my impression of it, based on what you said, was having this cloud of collaborators, have a whole bunch of different, you know, important, all these collaborators in your group.

850
00:50:22,851 --> 00:50:29,813
You also said this thing about backup support. So is there redundancies built into this model? Or is there, like, could you talk more about this?

851
00:50:31,118 --> 00:50:34,741
Let's talk about something that isn't Demi's first and talk about the glory that's Blaseball.

852
00:50:34,961 --> 00:50:42,648
Yeah, if you go to Blaseball.com you can sign up because it simulates the experience of watching like the NBA or the MLB.

853
00:50:42,668 --> 00:50:45,470
We're currently in an offseason so we're not running right now.

854
00:50:45,811 --> 00:50:51,456
But if you go and sign up, you'll get added to our newsletter and you will find out when we are coming back.

855
00:50:51,596 --> 00:50:54,198
And I promise you will know when we are coming back.

856
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,860
All right. That's very ominous.

857
00:50:58,674 --> 00:51:00,415
As far as this consolation and collaboration.

858
00:51:00,455 --> 00:51:02,337
We actually, we just ran out of time.

859
00:51:03,338 --> 00:51:04,138
Oh, sorry.

860
00:51:04,158 --> 00:51:05,239
You'll never learn.

861
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:08,302
I'm keeping the knowledge, it's mine!

862
00:51:08,682 --> 00:51:09,643
We'll go ahead and wrap up here.
