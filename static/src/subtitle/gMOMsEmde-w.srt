1
00:00:05,168 --> 00:00:11,330
I'm Yukio Futatsugi, and I was a game director and a game designer of the Panzer Dragon series.

2
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:12,511
And...

3
00:00:14,752 --> 00:00:16,052
I'm Kentaro Yoshida.

4
00:00:17,253 --> 00:00:19,694
I'm a Panzer Dragon Tsubai art director.

5
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:23,615
And now I'm working in the Granding Kyoto studio.

6
00:00:24,956 --> 00:00:27,997
And now I'm working in Granding, my own company now.

7
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:29,698
A little promo.

8
00:00:29,718 --> 00:00:29,798
So...

9
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:38,671
I will speak in Japanese and translate the conversation.

10
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:40,812
First, I would like to start with the question, what is Panzer Dragoon?

11
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,853
I don't think there is anyone here who needs to answer that question.

12
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:10,526
As a Sega Saturn software,

13
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:12,008
it was released in Japan on March 10, 1995.

14
00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:13,830
It was a launch title in the US.

15
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,871
It will be 25 years next year.

16
00:01:22,644 --> 00:01:28,410
So Panzer Dragoon is a Sega Saturn game that was released in Japan first on March 10, 1995,

17
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:35,636
and then in the U.S. two months later on May 11, which was part of a surprise launch of

18
00:01:35,676 --> 00:01:36,217
the system.

19
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:40,041
And next year, it will be celebrating its 25th anniversary.

20
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:43,055
When I joined SEGA a year later,

21
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:45,477
I was asked to write a proposal for SEGA Saturn.

22
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:48,339
At that time, the only genres left were drive and shooting.

23
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,082
At first, I chose drive and wrote a proposal,

24
00:01:51,122 --> 00:01:53,103
but the game release was decided a while later,

25
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:54,685
so the only genre left was 3D shooting.

26
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:58,869
I said, I'll write a proposal for 3D shooting,

27
00:01:58,889 --> 00:01:59,769
and I made Panzer Dragoon.

28
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:12,720
So only one year after joining SEGA, the company,

29
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,102
I was asked to come up with a design document

30
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:17,444
for a brand new Saturn game.

31
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:20,886
And at that time, I was given a choice,

32
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:23,609
but the choice was down to only two different genres.

33
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:26,151
One was racing and the other one was shooting.

34
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:28,433
And I actually chose racing

35
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:31,035
and even drafted a document based on that.

36
00:02:31,155 --> 00:02:34,337
But Gale Racer was then greenlit right after that.

37
00:02:34,758 --> 00:02:37,780
And so I had no choice but to really come up with an idea

38
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,501
for a shooting game.

39
00:02:39,021 --> 00:02:43,303
And so this was the beginning of what turned into the 3D shooting game, Panzer Dragoon.

40
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:09,997
So at the time Virtua Fighter, I'm sure you all know, was being developed at a different team, at the AM2 team.

41
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:14,321
And I was told it was something I had to see if I was going to make a 3D game.

42
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:20,606
And when I saw the character models and their realistic movements, I knew that that was exactly what I needed to aim for.

43
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:33,686
As you know, back then, 3D shooting was all about models that had no movement, like a fighter jet.

44
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:39,007
I thought that if we could put a soft character in there, it would have a lot of impact.

45
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:45,489
And most 3D shooting games back then featured models of very hard and sharp-looking objects like fighter planes.

46
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:51,050
So, in contrast to that, I thought a character that moved like a living creature would stand out.

47
00:03:52,304 --> 00:03:57,086
And then I thought on ideas of what kinds of things I want to try riding.

48
00:03:57,126 --> 00:04:01,248
A dragon seemed like something that anyone would want to ride, and that's how I arrived

49
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:05,610
at the decision to make a shooting game where you ride a dragon.

50
00:04:25,663 --> 00:04:29,625
These are some sample design documents from those days.

51
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:33,087
This page is about the play action.

52
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:36,128
If you look closely, you'll see that it wasn't a homing laser at first.

53
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:44,637
So they're centered around the action, the types of action that would be available to the player.

54
00:04:44,657 --> 00:04:50,463
And if you look very carefully, you'll notice that we didn't have the homing laser at first.

55
00:04:51,164 --> 00:04:54,787
And we were also thinking that the game's world would fit more into the fantasy genre.

56
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:09,668
The homing laser was implemented later after we determined that the 3D shooting mechanics made aiming difficult.

57
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:30,524
And then the world and the setting of Panzer Dragoon was fleshed out

58
00:05:30,684 --> 00:05:32,984
only after the game was officially greenlit.

59
00:05:39,226 --> 00:05:41,206
At the time, there were a lot of 3D shooting games,

60
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:42,647
but my favorite was Namco's Starblade.

61
00:05:46,282 --> 00:05:49,903
So among all the shooting games that were available at that time,

62
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:56,025
I was particularly interested and really liked Starblade from Namco.

63
00:06:13,092 --> 00:06:15,883
I wanted to make a game where you can experience the same story.

64
00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:24,287
I was really moved and really impressed by the game's cinematic presentation and how

65
00:06:24,347 --> 00:06:27,948
it offered the experience of a very grand Star Wars-like story.

66
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:35,069
And another thing that took me by surprise but thought it worked really well was the

67
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:40,890
lack of background music until the very, very end where you first hear it as you engage

68
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,530
in a showdown with the rival ship.

69
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,511
So playing that game, I thought that if I...

70
00:06:46,511 --> 00:06:50,335
I were to ever make a shooting game that I don't want to make it like Starblade.

71
00:07:07,947 --> 00:07:11,808
So to that point, we landed on these objectives that you see here.

72
00:07:11,828 --> 00:07:17,790
The first one being to show the game as a continuous story that flows seamlessly from

73
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,231
the very beginning to the end.

74
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:25,393
Secondly, maximize the use of on-screen information to work the player's imagination.

75
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,506
We also decided to add polygons using objects from the game

76
00:07:29,586 --> 00:07:32,369
and since the time for rail shooting is already set,

77
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:35,972
we decided to make the music to match the game development

78
00:07:36,012 --> 00:07:38,855
and the music to match the screen until we reached the boss.

79
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:48,873
Thirdly, inserting polygonal cutscenes during interludes that use objects from the game proper.

80
00:07:48,993 --> 00:07:53,415
And then the last one was, we knew that creating a Rail Shooter game,

81
00:07:53,455 --> 00:07:58,517
the time frame of how long that lasted was pretty much a fixed time length.

82
00:07:58,597 --> 00:08:02,559
So creating music that matched the fixed pace of the game's progression

83
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,940
all the way up until the last boss encounter,

84
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,123
much like you would see sort of directed or planned out in a movie.

85
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:11,983
That was one of our objectives as well.

86
00:08:20,684 --> 00:08:25,206
So for the next couple of slides, I will talk about the visual concepts of Panzer Dragoon.

87
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:31,548
The visual concepts were created by designer and art director Manabu Kusunoki.

88
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:43,890
Star Wars, Dune, Wings of Onyx,

89
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,632
and other works that can show the world of the game,

90
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:49,533
such as the culture of the panther world,

91
00:08:49,553 --> 00:08:50,774
and the concept of the landscape,

92
00:08:50,794 --> 00:08:52,435
were all created by Mr. Kusunoki.

93
00:09:04,522 --> 00:09:13,124
Very much like how things were done, we assume, for Star Wars, Dune, Royal Space Force, the wings of Onimis, and so on,

94
00:09:13,324 --> 00:09:20,906
we created lots and lots of concept materials related to the cultures and the landscapes of this fictional world that we were creating,

95
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:23,147
and then applied that to the game design.

96
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:32,594
So I brought some of the actual concept assets from back then.

97
00:09:32,654 --> 00:09:34,154
So I'd like to go through some of these.

98
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:37,616
So the first one is the 9th century.

99
00:09:37,636 --> 00:09:39,437
The second one is the 9th century.

100
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,638
So the first one is the ancient age.

101
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:52,060
This term or phrase from Futatsuki-san was our key word.

102
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,361
It carried tremendous weight throughout the entire course of developing

103
00:09:56,381 --> 00:09:58,141
and working on this project.

104
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:16,125
So basically everything was centered around ancient age.

105
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:25,127
So anything that didn't fit into the ideas or concepts that initially felt

106
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:29,328
like they didn't fit into the ancient age became nothing less than natural.

107
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:34,729
Once we applied that term, saying that this is what it is, this is when it

108
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:35,169
happened.

109
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:42,637
In order to build up the interesting elements of this game, we went about making it such that even if it was truly bizarre,

110
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:44,339
out-of-this-world idea,

111
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:50,025
we would say, oh no, the player would think, well, if we're talking about the age and age here,

112
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:53,649
then I suppose it makes sense. And that's how we made sense of it all.

113
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:58,827
But we came up with white materials that will play key roles in the game,

114
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:00,590
and they are the structural elements.

115
00:11:06,072 --> 00:11:12,880
A highly advanced civilization that flourished in an age-long past with systematic designs

116
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:19,728
that used ceramic-toned materials and metallic parts, very similar to mechanical timepieces

117
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:25,895
and so on, they became what we would call the motif of the overall design direction.

118
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:30,743
The history of the advanced civilization reflected in the past,

119
00:11:30,763 --> 00:11:36,247
ceramic materials, and mechanical clock-shaped metal parts are included in the design.

120
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:37,928
Sorry, I translated it first.

121
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:38,888
Let's move on.

122
00:11:38,928 --> 00:11:40,549
Oh, there are still some.

123
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,911
The motif is still there.

124
00:11:43,931 --> 00:11:48,154
I also remember referring to the Bega illustration I saw in Katsuhiro Otomo's painting.

125
00:11:54,244 --> 00:11:57,905
The motif and the overall design direction that I just mentioned,

126
00:11:57,945 --> 00:12:04,566
these designs were actually largely influenced by a character that was created by Otomo-san,

127
00:12:04,586 --> 00:12:07,047
Katsuhiro Otomo, the character Vega.

128
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:10,388
And next we have the Empire.

129
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:24,890
The design of the Empire is based on the design of the modern warplanes and battleships

130
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,491
and the design of the old-fashioned weapons and engines

131
00:12:27,511 --> 00:12:30,213
that were discovered over the long period of time.

132
00:12:37,265 --> 00:12:41,650
So with the Empire, the setting is that this is a civilized country that recovered

133
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,272
from the world once it was destroyed.

134
00:12:44,432 --> 00:12:51,980
So we combined weaponry like the tanks and battleships of World War I, and then

135
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,723
the excavated weaponry and engine from the ancient age.

136
00:12:55,803 --> 00:13:00,588
So it was a combination that sort of created the foundation of the design.

137
00:13:09,593 --> 00:13:15,016
And one sort of key area that I really focused on or wanted to highlight was making these

138
00:13:15,116 --> 00:13:16,837
silhouettes really stand out.

139
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:20,399
And by doing so, it gave it a sense of massive scale.

140
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:25,462
And next we have the dragons and the attack organisms.

141
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:35,182
So for the dragons, they were organic weapons of the ancient age.

142
00:13:35,202 --> 00:13:38,346
So we gave them the same white armor that those of the ancient age would wear.

143
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:50,853
And for the attack organisms, those were created during...

144
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:52,654
the ones that were created during the ancient age were given armor,

145
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:54,815
while the armor was removed for those that were not.

146
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,577
So, in the game, the ones with armor were strong,

147
00:13:56,597 --> 00:13:57,717
while the ones without armor were weak.

148
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,241
And then in the game, they were ranked accordingly.

149
00:14:22,401 --> 00:14:27,382
So the former were stronger and the latter, with the armor removed, were weaker.

150
00:14:27,402 --> 00:14:30,283
And then next we have the world.

151
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:33,004
So the planet is losing the ability to purify itself and steadily edges towards oblivion.

152
00:14:48,165 --> 00:14:51,786
And the planet ravaged by war is reclaimed by nature as the ages drag on.

153
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:54,867
After developing these setups like Asterisk, Zubai, that is within the Pantheon world,

154
00:14:54,887 --> 00:14:57,108
we have kept up the standard.

155
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:21,144
The visuals that make up the world of Panzer Dragoon are realized in both Zwei and Saga

156
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:24,027
by cherishing these elements of the world's lore.

157
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:39,033
And so there's actually a little episode here.

158
00:15:39,514 --> 00:15:44,038
The reason that we were able to dedicate so much time to the particulars and the

159
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:47,822
specifics of the world and the creation here was because

160
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:51,206
the Sega Saturn's development kits,

161
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:56,251
they were behind schedule and we had an extra two or three months where

162
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:58,773
we were unable to proceed with development.

163
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,727
which was ultimately a good thing and it worked towards our favor as during that time we were

164
00:16:02,747 --> 00:16:05,608
able to really flesh out the world in a lot of different ways it was also this time that

165
00:16:05,628 --> 00:16:07,690
we came up with Panzerese, the fictional language of the world.

166
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,050
Take down the PlayStation.

167
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:30,550
Yes!

168
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:37,733
So, as we all know, PlayStation, our rival hardware,

169
00:16:37,753 --> 00:16:40,333
was set to launch around the same time as the Sega Saturn.

170
00:16:56,358 --> 00:17:00,120
And it had a reputation for having superior 3D capabilities.

171
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,340
That was no secret.

172
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:04,442
Even within Sega, it was a hot topic.

173
00:17:05,382 --> 00:17:10,084
And in a way, the Sega Saturn was the ultimate 2D hardware system,

174
00:17:10,124 --> 00:17:12,745
but it possessed the best scrolling display capabilities.

175
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:26,595
And in order to win over and sort of beat PlayStation's visual presentation,

176
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:29,438
we needed to showcase the expanse of space on screen.

177
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,323
We designed the levels to be able to show the clouds,

178
00:17:50,363 --> 00:17:52,304
the distant landscape, the water, the desert,

179
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:52,904
and so on.

180
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:54,785
So with that in mind, we designed levels

181
00:17:55,345 --> 00:17:56,646
taking scrolling to the max

182
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,847
through vast landscapes with clouds and water surfaces

183
00:17:58,887 --> 00:17:59,408
and deserts.

184
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:15,293
I think you know this if you are a Sega or Saturn fan,

185
00:18:15,373 --> 00:18:18,777
but the 3D expression of Saturn is made up of transform sprites.

186
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:37,945
I don't think game developers can believe this,

187
00:18:38,105 --> 00:18:39,506
but 1 polygon equals 1 sprite.

188
00:18:39,526 --> 00:18:43,048
You need to have as many polygons as possible,

189
00:18:43,168 --> 00:18:45,270
and the texture is distorted.

190
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,392
So modern game developers may find this very, very tough to believe,

191
00:18:49,532 --> 00:18:52,214
but each and every polygon is a sprite.

192
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:57,037
So not only did we need to prepare individual textures for each polygon,

193
00:18:57,117 --> 00:18:58,978
but the textures also warped.

194
00:19:01,913 --> 00:19:03,994
When we were developing Panzer,

195
00:19:04,114 --> 00:19:07,095
the programmer provided us with the original texture mapping tool,

196
00:19:07,195 --> 00:19:09,055
and we used that to map the textures.

197
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:12,336
So for the development of Panzer Dragoon,

198
00:19:12,556 --> 00:19:16,838
our programmer put together an original texture splitting tool

199
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:19,019
that we could use for texture mapping.

200
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,180
Also, compared to the PlayStation,

201
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,601
the function of the semicircular surface and the drawing of polygons

202
00:19:26,621 --> 00:19:27,141
were quite weak.

203
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:32,388
And in addition to that, the Saturn, when compared to the PlayStation,

204
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:38,433
didn't pack much of a punch in terms of translucency, functionality, or polygon interaction.

205
00:19:38,894 --> 00:19:41,356
But as a result, it didn't have a shiny metallic world,

206
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:46,241
but it matched well with the dry world of Panzer Dragoon, and we were able to express a unique visual.

207
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:48,282
That's what I think, looking back on it now.

208
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:59,871
But looking back at it now, I believe we were able to create these unique visuals that mesh very well with the sort of dry

209
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:03,634
World of Panzer Dragoon not to not something that's shiny

210
00:20:04,335 --> 00:20:10,280
And sort of glamorous and not that ever I would ever want to go back to that era of game development

211
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,242
But I think it really worked out for the game

212
00:20:13,063 --> 00:20:16,745
Yeah, so if you ask me now to go through that again and make something similar, I would kindly refuse.

213
00:20:16,765 --> 00:20:19,226
But as a result, we created visuals that were impossible on the PlayStation.

214
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:39,581
I remember going to a PSP event with my game developer friend, Suto,

215
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:42,083
and I was shocked to see Ridge Racer.

216
00:20:42,163 --> 00:20:43,984
We were both at the station, thinking,

217
00:20:44,004 --> 00:20:46,166
what are we going to do? What are we going to do?

218
00:20:53,984 --> 00:20:56,605
But I have, I'll tell you a quick story.

219
00:20:56,725 --> 00:21:03,266
I do remember going to a PlayStation sort of presentation of their debut of the

220
00:21:03,286 --> 00:21:04,966
hardware with all these titles.

221
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:10,307
I was there with our programmer Sudo-san and he was working obviously on Panzer

222
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:12,027
Dragoon. While we were there,

223
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:15,148
we saw Ridge Racer and we were so blown away.

224
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:21,289
The level of shock was so big that on the way back we were riding home,

225
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:23,530
we were riding home, taking the train back and we were like...

226
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,112
What the hell are we going to do about this?

227
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:37,844
And that's how much we were thinking about and how unconscious we were at Sega about PlayStation.

228
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:53,403
So even to this day, I have this lingering sort of trauma from those days, from that era,

229
00:21:53,864 --> 00:21:59,607
that causes me to be very, very irritated any time I think about it

230
00:21:59,627 --> 00:22:01,869
or someone mentions the original PlayStation.

231
00:22:11,057 --> 00:22:14,839
And so seeing, I don't know if you guys had commercials out here,

232
00:22:14,939 --> 00:22:18,602
but there are some PlayStation Classic commercials airing on TV.

233
00:22:19,623 --> 00:22:21,324
And it's not pleasant to me.

234
00:22:21,364 --> 00:22:23,365
It's very, very painful to watch.

235
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:29,792
So, Panzer was released and we made a lot of sales.

236
00:22:29,812 --> 00:22:33,195
We accepted the fun of shooting and the uniqueness of the world,

237
00:22:33,396 --> 00:22:36,078
so we decided to make a sequel that specialized in both.

238
00:22:44,557 --> 00:22:46,977
So even after all that pain that we went through,

239
00:22:48,478 --> 00:22:51,399
the first Panzer Dragoon was very well received,

240
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:55,420
both in terms of how much fun it is as a game,

241
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,340
as a shooting game,

242
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,161
and the uniqueness of the world that we built.

243
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:03,162
And so we were told to make separate sequels

244
00:23:03,762 --> 00:23:06,163
that specialized in each of those areas.

245
00:23:07,746 --> 00:23:12,448
After we decided on the story and the general direction that things would go in,

246
00:23:12,488 --> 00:23:19,291
we split the teams into two and they were developed side by side or simultaneously at the same time.

247
00:23:19,951 --> 00:23:25,154
So what we did was we decided on the story and the general direction that things would go in,

248
00:23:25,674 --> 00:23:31,677
and after some of the groundwork was laid for Tsubai, we actually split the teams into two,

249
00:23:31,937 --> 00:23:36,019
and they were developed side by side or simultaneously at the same time.

250
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:41,722
I was mainly in charge of Saga, and Kentaro Yoshida was mainly in charge of Tsubai.

251
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:44,083
So, I'm going to let him talk about Tsubai next.

252
00:23:44,584 --> 00:23:50,128
So, I basically led the Saga team, whereas Yoshida here led the Tsubai team.

253
00:23:50,168 --> 00:23:53,210
So, I'm going to hand it back to him and let's talk a little bit about that.

254
00:23:54,571 --> 00:23:58,133
The game system of Panzer Dragoon is a 3D shooting that allows you to move the time,

255
00:23:58,193 --> 00:24:01,255
and a gun shooting that doesn't allow you to move the time.

256
00:24:03,872 --> 00:24:08,998
So the game systems of Panzer Dragoon are primarily a mix of two concepts.

257
00:24:09,118 --> 00:24:12,722
The first being a 3D type shooter where you're able to move your character

258
00:24:13,303 --> 00:24:16,287
and then a light gun type shooter where you don't move.

259
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:19,071
And during development, the difficulty of combining these two into a single game

260
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:21,072
is something that I was told, it was called out to me by the more higher,

261
00:24:21,272 --> 00:24:24,054
sort of experienced colleagues and development staff at the company.

262
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,291
In Panzer Dragoon 1, we used half-power moves to put it all together into one game.

263
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:47,452
But we wanted to do something about the following sequences of shooting.

264
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,426
And also, seeing how we were also telling a story,

265
00:25:08,446 --> 00:25:10,026
we had this problem where someone might think that,

266
00:25:10,066 --> 00:25:11,407
well, if I finish once, I'm done with the game.

267
00:25:30,255 --> 00:25:37,257
For Panzer Dragoon 1, what we did in order to not let that sort of feeling linger on to the users,

268
00:25:37,297 --> 00:25:42,219
what we did was we stretched out the game's length purely by raising its difficulty,

269
00:25:42,719 --> 00:25:45,480
resulting in a game that you could play for much longer.

270
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,342
Obviously, as a result, we did hear a lot of users, players, and fans talking about how the game was too hard.

271
00:25:58,696 --> 00:26:02,859
In the sequel, Tsubai wanted to play the game many times, even though it was a story game.

272
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:08,643
He wanted to feel the fun of shooting, even though he didn't feel the difficulty.

273
00:26:08,663 --> 00:26:10,644
We had to solve this contradictory problem.

274
00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:17,371
So it's why having narrative elements to it,

275
00:26:17,751 --> 00:26:22,092
but we needed a solution to this very big problem

276
00:26:22,813 --> 00:26:24,133
of how do you make a game

277
00:26:24,553 --> 00:26:27,094
that you want to play over and over repeatedly

278
00:26:27,234 --> 00:26:30,456
and is fun to play purely for its shooting elements

279
00:26:30,896 --> 00:26:32,196
without it ever being difficult.

280
00:26:39,024 --> 00:26:42,727
So, some of the things listed on this slide, on the bullet points,

281
00:26:42,927 --> 00:26:48,352
these are the things that help us sort of resolve that problem that we had.

282
00:26:48,372 --> 00:26:56,999
I think the people who played Tsubaya remember this.

283
00:26:57,019 --> 00:26:59,461
This is a video of the ground stage to create a sense of secrecy.

284
00:27:02,612 --> 00:27:08,277
So, those who have played, I'm sure this is very familiar to you.

285
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:14,563
But we wanted to figure out a way to really accentuate the sensation of flight.

286
00:27:29,086 --> 00:27:32,770
So the ground is made using a Sega Saturn scrolling layer.

287
00:27:32,971 --> 00:27:35,714
In order to represent flying from the mountains,

288
00:27:35,794 --> 00:27:40,199
we needed to show the ground in locations both high and low.

289
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,224
But the thing is, we only had one scrolling layer to use.

290
00:27:45,005 --> 00:27:46,727
We only had one scrolling layer to use.

291
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:53,703
So, what we had to do is make smart use of these corners and turns, like you see right

292
00:27:53,723 --> 00:27:57,245
now, going from higher to lower and vice versa, sort of quickly switching the scrolling layer

293
00:27:57,305 --> 00:27:57,565
in between.

294
00:28:25,844 --> 00:28:39,233
So, by doing so, we were sort of tricking the players into thinking that you would see the high and low while you're making these turns and making these corners.

295
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:45,016
This was a difficult part for the programmer, but thanks to that, we were able to make the players feel the excitement and feel the growth of the Dragon.

296
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:54,169
So while this wasn't an easy task, I think this was a good resolution that our team,

297
00:28:54,229 --> 00:28:59,311
our programmers came up with. We struggled with it, but we're ultimately very happy.

298
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:07,015
And we think that it provided the player with both a very high sort of quality experience in

299
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:13,238
terms of the sensation that you get of flying and also at the same time seeing the dragon's growth.

300
00:29:15,145 --> 00:29:18,667
We also implemented a mechanic that automatically adjusts the difficulty based on the player's skill.

301
00:29:18,687 --> 00:29:20,768
Why we did this is because our director, Kondo-san,

302
00:29:44,621 --> 00:29:52,605
You know, 3D shooting game could be categorized as more of a core game that is not open to

303
00:29:52,785 --> 00:29:57,908
or as easy to get into for someone that is not a shooting game sort of pro player.

304
00:29:58,028 --> 00:30:02,991
So he incorporated this difficulty adjustment system, ADIC, into the game.

305
00:30:03,851 --> 00:30:10,414
By the way, it says automatic difficulty adjustment, but ADIC does stand for automatic difficulty

306
00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:11,895
enemy control system.

307
00:30:13,368 --> 00:30:17,009
And what the system did was it was looking at the players' results,

308
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:21,091
and it would dynamically adjust the number of enemies, the number of remaining bullets, and so on,

309
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:24,012
all the while you played. So the system itself was very much ahead of its time.

310
00:30:42,817 --> 00:30:44,879
So, as I said earlier, on one hand we had team Tsuai working on that,

311
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:46,279
and then I was leading team Saga.

312
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:47,700
I've been working on games for over 25 years now,

313
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,481
and if you ask me what was the most difficult project I've ever worked on,

314
00:30:49,501 --> 00:30:51,283
I can definitely say it's Saga.

315
00:31:10,506 --> 00:31:14,227
So, let me start off by saying that if you were to ask me

316
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:18,689
which game in my 25-year career in game development

317
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:20,870
gave me the most grief,

318
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:27,832
you might probably know the answer already, but let me tell you, without

319
00:31:28,192 --> 00:31:29,973
even a shred of doubt, this is it.

320
00:31:38,754 --> 00:31:42,557
And the why, then why is it Saga? Why is it this game?

321
00:31:42,697 --> 00:31:45,519
Well, we simply try to do way too much.

322
00:32:00,706 --> 00:32:04,269
So what you see on the slide here right now, I know it's very hard to see.

323
00:32:04,369 --> 00:32:08,233
This is not the initial concept or design document.

324
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:13,738
This is a design document, maybe six months to a year into production,

325
00:32:13,918 --> 00:32:19,143
trying to explain to the larger group what we are trying to do.

326
00:32:23,393 --> 00:32:25,074
First, we wanted to make a full 3D RPG.

327
00:32:25,094 --> 00:32:27,695
We wanted to make it as simple as possible,

328
00:32:27,735 --> 00:32:30,017
and expand on what we did with Panzer I.

329
00:32:30,057 --> 00:32:34,659
We wanted to make a game where you can experience a 3D model in a movie,

330
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:36,920
not a shooting game, but a RPG.

331
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:43,955
So what we were trying to do is to make a full 3D RPG.

332
00:32:44,055 --> 00:32:46,758
And not just that, we tried to take the original

333
00:32:46,838 --> 00:32:49,480
Panzer Dragoon and flesh it out in a way

334
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,522
that would make it into an RPG.

335
00:32:51,983 --> 00:32:54,946
We basically took a game that allowed you to experience

336
00:32:54,986 --> 00:32:58,409
a movie that plays out with 3D models

337
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:01,392
and try to make an RPG out of it.

338
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:08,031
At that time, you had games that would render images for the backgrounds and then use model for the characters alone as a means for presenting them more effectively.

339
00:33:08,072 --> 00:33:11,074
A good example that comes to mind is Resident Evil.

340
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:30,511
So with that as our starting point, we decided to jump on this crazy challenge for ourselves

341
00:33:30,571 --> 00:33:32,832
of creating the entire world in 3D and then making movies in it.

342
00:33:50,553 --> 00:33:52,393
It's a common thought now, but as far as I know,

343
00:33:52,433 --> 00:33:55,414
there were very few titles that challenged this, except for a few PC titles.

344
00:33:55,454 --> 00:33:57,595
Also, it was very difficult to switch from shooting to battle.

345
00:34:20,347 --> 00:34:25,809
Also, to where the title says, to new RPG battles that play like 3D shooters.

346
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:27,809
This was a massive challenge.

347
00:34:28,289 --> 00:34:30,750
You don't even probably think about doing this.

348
00:34:47,417 --> 00:35:01,401
It was so different from your typical RPG that even after a lot of discussions, a lot of trying, a lot of testing out these test builds, a whole year went by and we had really nothing good to show for it.

349
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:12,602
So at that point, we swapped out the person in charge of creating the battle system

350
00:35:13,303 --> 00:35:14,583
and gave it to someone else.

351
00:35:14,843 --> 00:35:17,244
And that person is Mukaiyama-san.

352
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:20,085
He would actually later on go to direct Panzer Dragoon Orta.

353
00:35:40,158 --> 00:35:44,239
So, where you once had what looks like a shooting game,

354
00:35:44,379 --> 00:35:49,060
you're now constantly trying to position yourself advantageously.

355
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,441
In terms of RPG elements,

356
00:35:50,461 --> 00:35:53,442
the fact that there are no parties because the player is solo

357
00:35:53,462 --> 00:35:54,962
is a type change due to Dragon's real-time transformation.

358
00:35:57,743 --> 00:36:03,371
The physical and magical elements are the dragon's attack and the player's attack,

359
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:06,136
and the various bomb-type attacks.

360
00:36:06,316 --> 00:36:08,038
We replaced the old system with a new one.

361
00:36:09,987 --> 00:36:13,148
And where you once had a game with a single character and no party,

362
00:36:13,528 --> 00:36:17,450
you now have a dragon that can change types and does so in real time.

363
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:22,431
Not only that, it is no longer just a physical and magical.

364
00:36:23,132 --> 00:36:25,553
The dragon can attack, the player can attack,

365
00:36:25,693 --> 00:36:29,174
and you also have a variety of explosives at your disposal.

366
00:36:30,715 --> 00:36:33,876
These are some of the examples of how we swapped out the mechanics.

367
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:38,176
At first, we wanted to make a game that was free to move around.

368
00:36:38,216 --> 00:36:40,758
But with the technology of the time, the quality of the map would drop,

369
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:42,860
and it wouldn't be a Panzer Dragoon-like game.

370
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,062
So we decided to move the map from the right to the left,

371
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:47,323
and make the map a box garden where you can move freely.

372
00:36:58,472 --> 00:37:03,655
So then we wanted to make a game where you could go wherever you wanted but doing so really harmed

373
00:37:03,675 --> 00:37:12,121
the visual quality of the map and it also wouldn't end up being very Panzer-esque anyway. So instead

374
00:37:12,141 --> 00:37:18,185
we made a system where you could choose which field to go from from an entire map and then

375
00:37:18,345 --> 00:37:22,688
once you were inside you would have a miniature garden that you could move about freely.

376
00:37:24,258 --> 00:37:29,680
We also introduced the concept of time, so you had day and night,

377
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,361
and see the differences between the two.

378
00:37:33,482 --> 00:37:36,503
And you could freely move about towns to a certain degree.

379
00:37:37,043 --> 00:37:41,245
And we also introduced the concept of time, so you had day and night,

380
00:37:41,405 --> 00:37:43,266
and see the differences between the two.

381
00:37:43,766 --> 00:37:47,587
And to that end, we also implemented, we had to use lighting,

382
00:37:47,747 --> 00:37:51,329
making so that you would see the change from dusk to night in real time.

383
00:37:52,289 --> 00:37:55,231
In order to make the city wider,

384
00:37:55,371 --> 00:37:58,614
we had to rewrite the memory so that the user could not understand it.

385
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:00,315
So we divided the city into two areas

386
00:38:00,335 --> 00:38:02,617
and made it into a long tunnel that connects both.

387
00:38:04,706 --> 00:38:06,747
And if we were going to make big towns,

388
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:11,209
we needed a way to rewrite things in the memory partway

389
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,850
through without making it obvious to the player.

390
00:38:14,571 --> 00:38:16,732
And what we did there was we created them

391
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:20,653
so that they would be divided into two separate areas that

392
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,834
would be connected by a long tunnel.

393
00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:33,353
At the time, there were no 3D games like this, so we made them all by hand.

394
00:38:33,373 --> 00:38:38,960
Now, it's just a matter of course, but I think we tried to do this a lot at the time.

395
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:51,764
So while you may have the freedom to move around some large areas,

396
00:38:51,804 --> 00:38:55,105
it would be annoying if you had to walk all the way over somewhere just to

397
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:59,647
examine something really small. So we decided to use this lock on system.

398
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:04,388
One thing we struggled with quite a bit was how to control the camera while

399
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:09,030
moving around the towns. Um, there weren't any 3d games like this at the time.

400
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:13,171
So we had to feel our way through everything we did. Um,

401
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:16,813
these are all things that we take for granted today, but when I think about it,

402
00:39:17,573 --> 00:39:22,495
I am really taken aback by just how much we were trying to do back then.

403
00:39:39,529 --> 00:39:43,031
we decided to create the game's cut scenes in full 3D as well.

404
00:39:43,632 --> 00:39:46,074
Well, after all, we were trying to make a movie here.

405
00:39:46,934 --> 00:39:49,656
And because we had such a huge number of events,

406
00:39:49,797 --> 00:39:53,199
we concluded that we would need to use motion capture

407
00:39:53,419 --> 00:39:54,680
if we were going to make them all.

408
00:39:55,381 --> 00:39:58,823
But back then, optical motion capture was still quite rare.

409
00:39:59,344 --> 00:40:01,746
So we were using magnetic motion capture.

410
00:40:08,059 --> 00:40:15,242
So I brought something. This is actually a video while we were filming the motion capture session for Saga.

411
00:40:34,688 --> 00:40:38,889
So I mentioned earlier that the optical motion capture was rare,

412
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:42,290
so we had to use magnetic motion capture. But when we do that,

413
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,751
then anything in the area emitting

414
00:40:47,411 --> 00:40:49,691
magnetism gets picked up as noise.

415
00:40:50,132 --> 00:40:52,792
So later on when we had to sort of clean up the data,

416
00:40:53,192 --> 00:40:56,013
in order for us to know kind of the positioning,

417
00:40:56,453 --> 00:41:00,234
we had a grid that you see in the left top, I think, corner.

418
00:41:00,634 --> 00:41:05,038
we had to place a grid so we had sort of a good sense of where things were placed.

419
00:41:24,594 --> 00:41:30,317
So obviously this is the opening scene and you could see that the person is riding the

420
00:41:30,817 --> 00:41:39,282
dragon which is made up of beer cases, the red and yellow beer cases, and you see another person

421
00:41:39,422 --> 00:41:44,645
holding the stack of beer cases because if that person wasn't there it would just fall over.

422
00:41:44,665 --> 00:41:51,268
So yeah we had to use some very creative and sort of smart tricks in order to make that happen.

423
00:41:55,149 --> 00:41:57,031
I'd like to summarize what we did.

424
00:41:57,091 --> 00:42:01,034
Saga has been through so many challenges.

425
00:42:01,114 --> 00:42:04,036
It's only natural that we've been through so many challenges,

426
00:42:04,056 --> 00:42:07,419
but we've been through so many challenges that no one has done before.

427
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:10,741
So these are only a few examples that I'm sharing today,

428
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:16,726
but we simply charged a headlong into too many difficult challenges.

429
00:42:16,746 --> 00:42:19,789
We were behind in terms of specifications in each department,

430
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:22,791
and we've been behind in development schedules for about a year.

431
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,844
So as a result, we were unable to nail down the specifics about the various parts of the game,

432
00:42:29,944 --> 00:42:33,707
and the development schedule was delayed maybe by a year.

433
00:42:39,611 --> 00:42:42,112
Not only that, our staff were so exhausted.

434
00:42:42,132 --> 00:42:46,415
And that led to a lot of conflicts here and there.

435
00:42:46,435 --> 00:42:49,617
With Full 3D, the volume of the game got bigger,

436
00:42:49,697 --> 00:42:53,020
and we didn't have the experience of managing a team of 50 people.

437
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:57,893
At that time, there was no ticket system to develop the large number efficiently,

438
00:42:57,913 --> 00:42:59,697
so the management cost was huge.

439
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:05,191
And then management costs spiraled out of control.

440
00:43:05,611 --> 00:43:10,133
The game packed a tremendous amount of volume due to it being in fully 3D.

441
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:14,955
I had no experience managing a team of close to 50 people,

442
00:43:15,576 --> 00:43:20,078
and we had no ticketing system that we could use to sort of effectively push

443
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:24,860
the development along with this large number of people on staff.

444
00:43:25,552 --> 00:43:29,734
The quality of the staff at SEGA was very high, so we managed to finish it.

445
00:43:29,754 --> 00:43:36,577
But it was quite expensive, so Team Andromeda had to disband.

446
00:43:37,257 --> 00:43:40,699
So the staff at SEGA are absolutely top-notch.

447
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:42,660
Everyone is very talented.

448
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,222
And it's only probably because of that we were somehow able to finish the game.

449
00:43:47,962 --> 00:43:52,304
But the team was disbanded because of how much it cost.

450
00:43:53,184 --> 00:43:54,085
Well, for me...

451
00:43:56,030 --> 00:44:00,791
I was about 50 years old, and I thought,

452
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:03,652
I can't do this challenge now.

453
00:44:04,812 --> 00:44:07,332
Now that I'm nearing age 50,

454
00:44:08,753 --> 00:44:11,733
I would not put this challenge onto myself.

455
00:44:12,434 --> 00:44:14,594
I would definitely not do it today.

456
00:44:14,614 --> 00:44:16,495
But I think I was able to do it because

457
00:44:16,535 --> 00:44:19,355
the whole industry was set up to change the game to something new.

458
00:44:25,568 --> 00:44:29,030
But I think we were able to overcome this challenge back then because of the

459
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:34,052
new hardware and all the energy and sort of the spirit just across the

460
00:44:34,152 --> 00:44:39,615
industry, not just at Sega, but there was this energy and sort of challenging

461
00:44:39,695 --> 00:44:42,296
spirit that was a very much alive back then.

462
00:44:42,976 --> 00:44:46,178
I can't say I did a good enough job, but at least we hoped to try to make that happen,

463
00:44:46,238 --> 00:44:48,940
and I think SEGA was truly an excellent company,

464
00:44:49,101 --> 00:44:53,884
making it possible to do so many things, but not just just within ourselves.

465
00:44:59,835 --> 00:45:05,798
Yeah, so...

466
00:45:06,018 --> 00:45:11,721
And so we were able to create games like Panzer Dragoon partly because we were young

467
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:19,124
and then the culture that we had at Sega was that we just wanted to create something.

468
00:45:19,144 --> 00:45:22,725
That was the kind of energy and spirit that was flowing

469
00:45:23,506 --> 00:45:27,608
and that's what made it possible for us to create some really good video games.

470
00:45:28,781 --> 00:45:33,285
I don't know if you know this, but SEGA's company's song is called Wakai Chikara.

471
00:45:56,293 --> 00:45:57,454
Sega was overflowing with youthful energy,

472
00:45:57,494 --> 00:45:59,675
and that's why we were able to make a game like Panzer Dragoon.

473
00:45:59,796 --> 00:46:01,277
Young people don't have much experience,

474
00:46:01,297 --> 00:46:02,598
so they can't imagine the difficulties ahead,

475
00:46:02,698 --> 00:46:05,060
and they end up making reckless attempts.

476
00:46:25,915 --> 00:46:29,857
When you're young, you naturally have no experience,

477
00:46:29,937 --> 00:46:31,938
but you can take on these chances

478
00:46:32,158 --> 00:46:34,519
and just really throw yourself at it.

479
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:36,160
And without the slightest idea

480
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,420
of how much hardship you're in for,

481
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,701
but that's exactly the kind of recklessness

482
00:46:38,721 --> 00:46:40,542
that really pushed our culture, the video game culture.

483
00:46:53,169 --> 00:47:01,255
We have aged, but we are still young, so we will continue to challenge ourselves.

484
00:47:01,995 --> 00:47:06,978
And moving forward, I want to believe in the promise of this youthful energy.

485
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:09,500
And that goes for me as well.

486
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:14,543
Even though I said I'm nearing 50, I may have aged a little bit,

487
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,204
but I'm still young on the inside.

488
00:47:16,385 --> 00:47:19,006
And so I hope to have many challenges ahead of me.

489
00:47:19,975 --> 00:47:24,617
I don't have much time to cover all three games,

490
00:47:24,897 --> 00:47:27,738
but I'll stop here.

491
00:47:28,298 --> 00:47:32,240
So, to cover all three games in the Panzer Dragoon series,

492
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,541
an hour is definitely not enough,

493
00:47:34,761 --> 00:47:36,702
but I hope you enjoyed our talk today.

494
00:47:36,722 --> 00:47:40,144
And we do have a little bit of time for Q&A,

495
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:43,105
so if it's okay, we'd like to move on to that.

496
00:47:43,965 --> 00:47:44,385
Thank you.

497
00:47:44,425 --> 00:47:45,466
Thank you.

498
00:47:53,364 --> 00:47:55,445
OK, so there are three mics.

499
00:47:56,226 --> 00:47:59,147
If anyone has any questions, please feel free to come up.

500
00:48:02,409 --> 00:48:02,589
Hi.

501
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:06,392
Firstly, thank you so much for the game.

502
00:48:06,492 --> 00:48:07,812
It means a lot to me.

503
00:48:08,893 --> 00:48:11,555
Is it true that the source code and assets for Saga

504
00:48:11,575 --> 00:48:12,235
have been lost?

505
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:20,200
Very good first question.

506
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,881
Probably the top FAQ.

507
00:48:22,871 --> 00:48:30,214
Well, actually, Yoshida and I quit while he was making Saga, mastering it and releasing it.

508
00:48:30,234 --> 00:48:31,495
So we don't really know where he went.

509
00:48:37,644 --> 00:48:42,789
So the true story is, so we mastered up Saga,

510
00:48:43,229 --> 00:48:46,632
and then between our master date and our release date,

511
00:48:47,453 --> 00:48:48,354
I left the company.

512
00:48:48,834 --> 00:48:51,076
So the real truth, the true story

513
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:54,559
is that I don't know what happened to the source code.

514
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:55,740
However.

515
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,723
I feel like I heard a rumor that it wasn't found,

516
00:48:58,763 --> 00:49:00,264
so it might have been found.

517
00:49:04,523 --> 00:49:09,025
However, I have heard rumors, and maybe everyone here has heard rumors,

518
00:49:09,685 --> 00:49:13,967
that it may have been discovered somewhere at some point.

519
00:49:13,987 --> 00:49:15,848
But forget that I even said that once you leave this room.

520
00:49:15,868 --> 00:49:16,328
Thank you.

521
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:29,483
Hi, thank you for making this awesome game.

522
00:49:29,683 --> 00:49:33,545
It's one of the reasons I became a game developer.

523
00:49:35,146 --> 00:49:41,470
I'd like to ask how hard it was to make the dragon movement.

524
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:45,232
Even today it still looks very smooth and really nice.

525
00:49:45,793 --> 00:49:49,575
The tail and the body and swings and the wings.

526
00:49:50,695 --> 00:49:52,457
So could you talk a little bit about that?

527
00:49:55,868 --> 00:50:02,091
I studied from the root as it seems that the most difficult part is to learn how to perform the movement.

528
00:50:02,151 --> 00:50:05,293
However, even now, when I take a look at the Dragon's movement, it is amazingly flexible.

529
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:08,434
Look at the movement of Kyo, and then look at how each movement was created,

530
00:50:08,454 --> 00:50:10,615
for instance, when the businesses stopped their hard work.

531
00:50:10,635 --> 00:50:12,676
Is it well explained to the viewers?

532
00:50:13,157 --> 00:50:13,557
Yes, it is.

533
00:50:13,597 --> 00:50:16,878
The animation for the first Panzer Dragoon was mostly composed by a designer.

534
00:50:19,707 --> 00:50:25,851
So for the first Panzer Dragoon, the animation was all done by hand by our animators.

535
00:50:25,871 --> 00:50:30,154
And I think you will agree with me that between the first and the second, including the camera

536
00:50:30,234 --> 00:50:33,456
movement, it's quite, there's a leap in the progression or the advancement that we made.

537
00:50:46,175 --> 00:50:51,580
Tsubai's programmer, Mr. Suto and Mr. Nakajishi

538
00:50:52,161 --> 00:50:56,285
were able to calculate the spring quite easily

539
00:50:56,325 --> 00:50:59,067
and that was applied to Tsubai's softness.

540
00:50:59,087 --> 00:51:00,629
That's what I heard at the time.

541
00:51:09,022 --> 00:51:14,967
So from what I recall or what I heard was we had our very, very talented programmers,

542
00:51:15,007 --> 00:51:20,331
Suto-san and Nakani-san, when they started working on Tsui, they were able to figure

543
00:51:20,471 --> 00:51:23,313
out some sort of calculation in terms of how

544
00:51:23,954 --> 00:51:26,016
the wings would sort of really give the flow

545
00:51:26,797 --> 00:51:30,822
and how realistic that would come out when put on screen.

546
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:34,346
So that would have been perhaps the sort of the magic touch

547
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:35,147
that they gave.

548
00:51:35,768 --> 00:51:38,712
And so you see the huge sort of improvements

549
00:51:38,792 --> 00:51:40,274
between the original and SWAI.

550
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:42,917
Thank you very much.

551
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:54,313
Hello. Could you describe one or maybe a few features that you really wanted to implement into one of the games, but you couldn't due to limitations of the Saturn?

552
00:52:03,652 --> 00:52:04,972
And any one of the three?

553
00:52:05,572 --> 00:52:05,732
Yes.

554
00:52:07,073 --> 00:52:11,375
After all that he said that they challenged themselves so much.

555
00:52:11,975 --> 00:52:13,656
Okay, how about the first one then?

556
00:52:14,056 --> 00:52:14,136
One.

557
00:52:14,236 --> 00:52:14,316
One?

558
00:52:14,336 --> 00:52:15,096
Yes, one.

559
00:52:15,537 --> 00:52:19,838
Well, it's the same for all of them, but the volume is cut quite a bit.

560
00:52:23,131 --> 00:52:25,773
So this applies to not just one, but to all of them.

561
00:52:26,654 --> 00:52:31,679
Basically, the game volume, we had to cut a lot.

562
00:52:32,419 --> 00:52:34,521
So if we had it our way, you would have

563
00:52:34,541 --> 00:52:36,643
gotten a lot more of the game.

564
00:52:36,663 --> 00:52:40,887
For example, in 1, at the end of the map where you fight in the capital,

565
00:52:40,947 --> 00:52:45,511
you might think, huh? The boss isn't here!

566
00:52:45,531 --> 00:52:47,372
But the boss didn't make it in time.

567
00:52:48,815 --> 00:52:51,780
So in one, the last map at the map of Tate,

568
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,783
you might be like, oh, you're playing, and you're playing,

569
00:52:53,823 --> 00:52:57,088
and it's like, wait a minute, where's the boss?

570
00:52:57,569 --> 00:52:58,571
Well, we had to cut the boss.

571
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:02,500
I was connected to the last boss, so I was being fooled.

572
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:07,781
But the one who was supposed to be with me was supposed to be the boss and fight.

573
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:10,522
But I didn't have time to make it, so it was gone.

574
00:53:10,582 --> 00:53:12,283
Yeah, so we simply ran out of time.

575
00:53:12,303 --> 00:53:14,323
We sort of convinced you that there...

576
00:53:22,726 --> 00:53:27,369
was or maybe could have been a boss but then we went to the last boss but initially there

577
00:53:27,389 --> 00:53:36,413
was supposed to be a boss and then into the last boss so we're sort of uh uh not tricking but we

578
00:53:36,473 --> 00:53:41,316
sort of made things up along the way because we ran out of time thank you

579
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:50,938
So one more thing though.

580
00:53:51,018 --> 00:53:56,999
So Suto-san and Takeshita-san, they came from the arcade side.

581
00:53:57,379 --> 00:53:59,820
So they were aiming for 60 frames per second.

582
00:53:59,840 --> 00:53:59,960
Wow.

583
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,921
Unfortunately, in order to make it interesting they're giving us 30 frames per second,

584
00:54:06,321 --> 00:54:10,342
but in the hidden strat they come up with, still with the 60 frames per second cheat it works.

585
00:54:18,711 --> 00:54:21,633
So while they were aiming for 60 frames per second,

586
00:54:21,773 --> 00:54:24,254
obviously the fun of the game overall

587
00:54:24,734 --> 00:54:27,696
took priority over achieving that frame rate.

588
00:54:27,816 --> 00:54:29,837
So eventually it landed around 30.

589
00:54:30,678 --> 00:54:33,959
But I guess there's a cheat where you can actually

590
00:54:34,019 --> 00:54:37,461
take a glimpse of what it looks like at 60 frames per second.

591
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,963
Does everyone know about that, I guess?

592
00:54:41,123 --> 00:54:41,283
No?

593
00:54:41,303 --> 00:54:41,343
No.

594
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:47,575
I guess there's a part of the stage where it's sped up and you can see that.

595
00:54:47,595 --> 00:54:49,056
Oh wow, thank you very much.

596
00:54:49,076 --> 00:54:50,837
We have like three minutes.

597
00:55:12,497 --> 00:55:18,498
There was news last year that the first two Painted Dragons will be remade.

598
00:55:19,278 --> 00:55:21,458
So do you have any comment on this?

599
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:24,219
The remake that was announced?

600
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:26,139
Remake of the first two Painted Dragons series.

601
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,120
You said that the first two will be remade.

602
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:33,801
Is there anything you can say about that?

603
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:37,982
We haven't been told anything about it, so we haven't been involved in the production.

604
00:55:38,002 --> 00:55:39,862
We hope it will be a good game.

605
00:55:41,773 --> 00:55:46,657
So we haven't been, I guess, given a word.

606
00:55:47,638 --> 00:55:49,019
We're not involved.

607
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:52,641
So all we can wish for is that it turns out,

608
00:55:53,262 --> 00:55:55,384
they both turn out well as a project.

609
00:55:55,904 --> 00:55:56,224
Thank you.

610
00:55:57,705 --> 00:55:57,966
Hi.

611
00:55:58,286 --> 00:56:00,948
You mentioned Starblade as kind of inspiration

612
00:56:01,068 --> 00:56:03,850
for the shooting kind of game that you wanted to make.

613
00:56:04,331 --> 00:56:07,053
When you were making Saga and making an RPG,

614
00:56:07,093 --> 00:56:10,335
were there any other RPGs that were kind of big inspiration?

615
00:56:11,526 --> 00:56:18,574
I really am inspired by Jiro Yamaoka's work.

616
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:23,440
In Saga...

617
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:24,702
OK, there was something else.

618
00:56:25,363 --> 00:56:25,963
OK, there was something else.

619
00:56:25,984 --> 00:56:26,624
OK, there was something else.

620
00:56:26,644 --> 00:56:27,425
OK, there was something else.

621
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:37,376
But we didn't have that, so it was hard work.

622
00:56:37,476 --> 00:56:40,521
And we inspired developers of OpenField a lot!

623
00:56:40,561 --> 00:56:42,785
There was nothing to be proud of.

624
00:56:49,576 --> 00:56:50,517
Sorry, we're laughing.

625
00:56:51,298 --> 00:56:53,100
He's like, hmm, that's a good question.

626
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:58,204
But it's probably because I can't

627
00:56:58,305 --> 00:57:01,768
name any titles that really influenced or inspired me.

628
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:06,032
And therefore, we went into this sort of crazy overachiever

629
00:57:06,472 --> 00:57:08,995
concept that we couldn't really pull off.

630
00:57:10,055 --> 00:57:11,717
because that's what we wanted to do.

631
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:14,519
And then Yoshida-san from the side said,

632
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:17,521
well, it's only because we were able to do what we did,

633
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:23,826
I think we actually inspired people to go out and do this more open field,

634
00:57:24,367 --> 00:57:27,449
open map sort of game, like design it that way.

635
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:32,293
And then Futsui-san was like, you're acting like a boss right now.

636
00:57:32,313 --> 00:57:36,456
Awesome. Thank you very much.

637
00:57:37,597 --> 00:57:37,978
Thank you.

638
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:41,390
Maybe, yeah, maybe last question we can take. Yeah.

639
00:57:42,091 --> 00:57:45,673
I just had a simple question that was related to, excuse me, Petri Dragoon saga.

640
00:57:46,294 --> 00:57:48,916
Was there ever a plan to have more than one city? I know development was,

641
00:57:49,756 --> 00:57:54,059
you know, rushed, but was there any plans to have more than one city that gets destroyed later?

642
00:58:08,242 --> 00:58:13,465
Well, after the city was gone, it became a different city.

643
00:58:13,525 --> 00:58:16,327
I didn't want to create a new city.

644
00:58:16,347 --> 00:58:21,751
I wanted to change it according to the progress of the game,

645
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:22,571
but I couldn't do that.

646
00:58:29,355 --> 00:58:31,176
No, actually, we we didn't.

647
00:58:32,017 --> 00:58:34,998
So obviously it was sort of the city was not reborn,

648
00:58:35,038 --> 00:58:36,559
but rebuilt as a different city.

649
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,302
The idea was that that city would evolve

650
00:58:42,922 --> 00:58:45,944
into a different sort of type of city.

651
00:58:46,604 --> 00:58:49,786
We weren't able to get there, but at the same time,

652
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:53,248
we also didn't have any ideas to have a new city either.

653
00:58:53,268 --> 00:58:54,668
Thank you.

654
00:58:56,653 --> 00:59:02,557
Okay, I think we're exactly at three o'clock, so thank you so, so much for attending.
