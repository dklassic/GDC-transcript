1
00:00:06,147 --> 00:00:06,907
I guess we get started.

2
00:00:06,947 --> 00:00:07,628
Good morning, everybody.

3
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:08,488
Thank you for coming.

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:10,690
My name is Sven Vincke.

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,072
I'm the founder and director of Larian Studios.

6
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:15,734
And so today I'll tell you a little bit about

7
00:00:16,194 --> 00:00:17,655
the making of Divinity Original Sin 2

8
00:00:18,196 --> 00:00:21,238
and the bruises we obtained while we were making it.

9
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:25,021
To start, I'll give you a very, very quick history

10
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,822
of Larian, just to give you some context

11
00:00:26,862 --> 00:00:29,064
for the decisions we made and the environment

12
00:00:29,104 --> 00:00:30,225
in which things were taking place.

13
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,246
We've been making RPGs since 97.

14
00:00:33,645 --> 00:00:36,186
And our history can be split in two parts.

15
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:38,987
There's the part before 2010, and there's a part after 2010.

16
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:42,168
And the part before 2010 was the part

17
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,809
where we depended on external funding to fund our projects.

18
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:46,510
So typically, those were publishers,

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,690
but there was also work for hire.

20
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,051
And post-2010, we took our fate in our own hands,

21
00:00:51,311 --> 00:00:54,132
and we started making, we started

22
00:00:54,172 --> 00:00:55,193
self-publishing our games.

23
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,241
And so Larin has always been a company

24
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:01,062
that tried to reach for the sky and often crashed,

25
00:01:01,282 --> 00:01:03,003
and that's where all the bruises come from.

26
00:01:03,764 --> 00:01:05,245
But we never gave up, we kept on trying,

27
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:08,866
and that has led to, I have to say,

28
00:01:08,947 --> 00:01:10,487
a very successful last five years.

29
00:01:11,428 --> 00:01:13,609
But we feel we earned it because the first 15 years

30
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:15,270
were very complicated.

31
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,032
So in 2014, we launched a game called Divinity Original Sin 1.

32
00:01:20,053 --> 00:01:21,613
It was very successful, it was a Kickstarter game.

33
00:01:22,194 --> 00:01:24,694
We raised $1 million on Kickstarter.

34
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:27,175
Game sold really well, had a high Metacritic,

35
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:28,395
was GameSpot's Game of the Year.

36
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,717
It sold, I think, 2.5 million units by now,

37
00:01:31,797 --> 00:01:32,997
so we're very happy about that.

38
00:01:33,797 --> 00:01:37,298
And it essentially gave us the rocket fuel

39
00:01:37,318 --> 00:01:39,379
that we needed to finally reach for the sky

40
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:42,260
and not try to crash on the ground.

41
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,781
But before we could do that,

42
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:47,061
we had to solve a few problems.

43
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:54,124
So after Original Sin 1, we came with the brilliant idea of making Original Sin 2.

44
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:56,125
It was a very hard decision to make.

45
00:01:57,106 --> 00:01:59,527
And we said this one is going to be the big one.

46
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:01,848
This is going to be the most ambitious game that we've ever made.

47
00:02:02,448 --> 00:02:07,771
And we are going to show the world that we always had it in ourselves to make brilliant RPGs.

48
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:10,491
To do that, we needed a much bigger team.

49
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:13,134
And one of the problems that we had been having

50
00:02:13,554 --> 00:02:15,416
was that the cost of living and of wages

51
00:02:15,657 --> 00:02:17,579
in the country where we started, which was Belgium,

52
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,560
was very high.

53
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,482
And when we looked, for instance, to the east,

54
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:22,925
we saw that some of our colleagues

55
00:02:23,025 --> 00:02:26,228
had wages that were almost half of what we were paying.

56
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:29,091
So that basically meant that they could have two developers

57
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:29,732
for us, one.

58
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:32,340
And another problem that we've been struggling with

59
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,920
was that of crunch.

60
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:35,301
As we were reaching for the sky,

61
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:38,783
we often had to fix problems that appeared out of thin air

62
00:02:38,843 --> 00:02:40,883
and we needed to fix them and we were a small team,

63
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:43,024
so that meant that we had to crunch a lot.

64
00:02:43,044 --> 00:02:44,265
So we tried to get rid of that.

65
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:46,746
And another problem that we had to solve was

66
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:52,272
we needed access to senior talent because in Belgium there's not much of a mature games

67
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:57,981
industry at least back then there wasn't and we needed people that actually had done productions

68
00:02:58,081 --> 00:03:02,467
had shipped many games and we couldn't find them or if we found them it was very expensive to bring

69
00:03:02,487 --> 00:03:02,827
them over.

70
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:05,350
So, the answer was obvious.

71
00:03:06,051 --> 00:03:11,436
We started looking outwards to other countries and we'd been working with a small studio

72
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:14,939
in St. Petersburg in Russia who had helped us with the Mac port of Divinity Original

73
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,863
Sin 1 and we approached them and we asked them, would you guys mind growing a little

74
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:21,986
bit because we could use some help and they said yes.

75
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:24,767
And so that's how Larin St. Petersburg was born.

76
00:03:25,508 --> 00:03:27,388
And then we started thinking about

77
00:03:27,448 --> 00:03:29,629
how can we solve this crunch problem?

78
00:03:29,749 --> 00:03:32,190
And the idea popped up that if you were capable

79
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,111
of organizing your processes one way or another,

80
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:36,291
that you could basically offload the work

81
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:38,292
that you had finished at five o'clock in the evening

82
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:41,273
and send it to another time zone and they could start,

83
00:03:41,353 --> 00:03:43,634
because for them it was the morning, working on that.

84
00:03:43,854 --> 00:03:46,275
Maybe you could have a longer production line per day

85
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:50,457
without having people to work continuously.

86
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,137
And that's how Larin Quebec was born.

87
00:03:52,837 --> 00:03:53,998
And then we had one last problem,

88
00:03:54,018 --> 00:03:55,359
which I didn't mention that we needed to solve,

89
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,559
is we needed a lot of writers.

90
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,001
English is not my native language, as you can hear,

91
00:04:01,302 --> 00:04:02,823
and it was hard to find writers for us.

92
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:04,344
So we started looking at the UK,

93
00:04:04,404 --> 00:04:06,845
which was the closest country

94
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:08,266
where people were speaking English,

95
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:10,267
and we ended up in Dublin,

96
00:04:11,007 --> 00:04:14,689
where we started a small office with nine writers,

97
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:17,471
and where we also decided to put our publishing team,

98
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:18,971
because we were self-publishing.

99
00:04:19,532 --> 00:04:26,983
And like this we ended up with four studios out of a small studio of 40 people in Ghent within the space of a year.

100
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:30,685
So all of this happened between September 2014

101
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:32,845
and February 2015.

102
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:38,007
And so while the Quebec and Dublin teams were being set up,

103
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:40,227
the team in Ghent and the team in St. Petersburg

104
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:42,108
started working on Divinity Original Sin 1,

105
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,149
the enhanced edition for PS4 and Xbox One.

106
00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:49,069
And so the idea was that each of these teams

107
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,830
that we set up were basically going to be clones

108
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,710
or mirrors of each other,

109
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:56,251
so that you could literally pass work on as the sun rose.

110
00:04:58,393 --> 00:05:01,155
And that was not the easiest thing in the world to set up,

111
00:05:01,536 --> 00:05:03,838
and it took a lot of time, but it started working,

112
00:05:03,858 --> 00:05:05,179
and we'll see some examples of that.

113
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,644
So by May 2015, we had teams that were operational

114
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:10,384
in Quebec and Dublin.

115
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:12,887
The guys in Ghent and St. Petersburg

116
00:05:12,927 --> 00:05:14,128
were working on Enhanced Edition,

117
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:17,691
and so it was time to start working on Original Sin 2.

118
00:05:18,132 --> 00:05:20,574
And so it was the Quebec team who had actually

119
00:05:20,594 --> 00:05:21,875
never worked on the Original Sin game.

120
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:24,776
and the Dublin team, which was full of new writers,

121
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:26,237
that were going to lead the charge.

122
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:27,738
And they started working on a small demo,

123
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:29,999
which was produced in three to four months,

124
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:32,400
which was going to showcase the pillars

125
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,900
of Divinity Original Sin 2,

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,441
and which we were going to use to show to press,

127
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:38,222
to the community, what we wanted to make,

128
00:05:38,502 --> 00:05:40,743
and which we wanted to also take to Kickstarter.

129
00:05:41,564 --> 00:05:46,346
And so the idea was that when the teams that were working on Original Sin 1 for PS4 and

130
00:05:46,406 --> 00:05:51,649
X1 were finished, they would then roll into the production that had been set up with the

131
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,890
Original Sin 2 demo.

132
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:59,691
So the core pillars of Original Sin 2 were that we wanted to have a better story.

133
00:05:59,971 --> 00:06:03,755
We got a lot of flack for the story in Original Sin 1, so we were frustrated by that and so

134
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:04,676
we wanted to fix that.

135
00:06:05,237 --> 00:06:06,959
We also wanted to improve the combat.

136
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:12,985
We got a lot of flack over the combat, especially from our hardcore community, after the beginning

137
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:15,108
of the game, so as we went into Act 2 and Act 3.

138
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,542
We also found that our modding plans that we had for Original Sin 1 hadn't been that successful,

139
00:06:21,562 --> 00:06:25,030
and dominantly because we hadn't really supported it well, so we wanted to fix that.

140
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,202
We also wanted to have a higher degree of polish

141
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:29,463
because we thought that the gameplay

142
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:31,764
that we were presenting could be consumed

143
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:33,325
by a lot more players than actually had

144
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:34,266
play original Sin 1.

145
00:06:35,006 --> 00:06:37,608
And multiplayer was one of the big innovations

146
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,070
of original Sin 1 in the narrative RPG space,

147
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,651
so we wanted to bring more multiplayer options.

148
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:44,973
And so all of these things translated

149
00:06:44,993 --> 00:06:48,435
in the following big axis of development.

150
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:51,197
We needed a more gripping story,

151
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,078
one that was going to captivate you

152
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:53,959
all the way until the end.

153
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,665
We needed a new style of writing so that people would see,

154
00:06:57,745 --> 00:06:59,387
okay, well, they mean it when they're talking

155
00:06:59,427 --> 00:07:00,149
about a better story.

156
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:05,192
We introduced what became known as the origin stories,

157
00:07:05,332 --> 00:07:08,214
which was essentially the ability to role play characters

158
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:10,696
who had a set background, a set story,

159
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:12,898
a different sets of quests within the world.

160
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:15,140
And we introduced a tag system,

161
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,682
which was essentially, if you played Dungeons & Dragons,

162
00:07:17,702 --> 00:07:18,703
then you know what a background is.

163
00:07:18,743 --> 00:07:20,724
It was essentially a background that you got in the game.

164
00:07:21,165 --> 00:07:22,646
And then whenever you talk to somebody,

165
00:07:22,706 --> 00:07:24,487
they would recognize that you had that background

166
00:07:24,547 --> 00:07:25,788
and they would react as if you.

167
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:27,733
were that person.

168
00:07:27,953 --> 00:07:31,322
And these were very important features

169
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:33,328
that we were introducing to those two.

170
00:07:34,414 --> 00:07:35,595
Another thing we wanted to do is,

171
00:07:36,095 --> 00:07:37,656
we felt that in Original Sin 2,

172
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:39,917
our action point economy was ruined

173
00:07:40,017 --> 00:07:41,398
because we had way too much action points,

174
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:42,758
so we wanted to be much tighter.

175
00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:44,519
And this came from a philosophy

176
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:46,681
that we wanted each point, anything that you,

177
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:49,362
every single level up point that you used

178
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:52,363
to feel important so that you would care about it.

179
00:07:53,544 --> 00:07:56,025
And we also wanted to change the armor system,

180
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,846
over which we got an enormous amount of flak.

181
00:07:57,906 --> 00:07:59,067
We'll talk about that a little bit later.

182
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:02,609
the armor system, which was very unclear in Original Sin 1,

183
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,551
and which we wanted to make a lot clearer

184
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:05,432
in Original Sin 2.

185
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:09,955
We also wanted to tie the story to the narrative mechanics

186
00:08:10,035 --> 00:08:11,976
that were being produced in the game.

187
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:14,238
So we felt the game was so large

188
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:16,880
that you needed to have a continuous stream

189
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,361
of new mechanics coming towards you

190
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:19,882
to motivate you to continue playing,

191
00:08:20,342 --> 00:08:21,883
and we wanted those mechanics to be present

192
00:08:21,944 --> 00:08:23,905
at every single spot in the game world

193
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:24,986
and indeed in the story.

194
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:29,137
And then to top it off, we wanted to have PvP multiplayer,

195
00:08:29,157 --> 00:08:31,318
or at least the option of having PvP multiplayer

196
00:08:31,398 --> 00:08:32,438
while you were playing the game.

197
00:08:32,898 --> 00:08:36,020
And this came from the idea that the core story

198
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,621
was going to be something that was similar to Highlander

199
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:40,081
in which there could be only one,

200
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:41,902
although we didn't know at that particular time

201
00:08:41,942 --> 00:08:43,442
what the only one was going to be.

202
00:08:43,683 --> 00:08:45,843
And we'll see that that was also a big problem.

203
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:51,342
And then finally, we wanted to have updated graphics,

204
00:08:51,442 --> 00:08:53,604
obviously, a more realistic visual style.

205
00:08:54,104 --> 00:08:57,606
And as I said, we wanted to take modding into account

206
00:08:57,647 --> 00:08:59,348
from the get-go, because adding modding

207
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:01,029
after the fact is very complicated.

208
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:03,791
But if you take it into your development pipeline

209
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:06,353
when you start, in general it should work.

210
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,083
So the Kickstarter demo was really successful.

211
00:09:10,644 --> 00:09:13,448
We made our million dollars in 12 hours,

212
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:14,910
or in the first day, sorry,

213
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:16,533
and we reached our goal within 12 hours.

214
00:09:17,746 --> 00:09:22,050
And so we were excited by that because obviously it meant that the direction that we had shown

215
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,334
to our community was appreciated and they wanted us to continue on that road.

216
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:33,179
And because we hadn't expected it was going to go that fast, we really hadn't prepared

217
00:09:33,219 --> 00:09:36,221
our stretch goals properly, but we said, you know what, we'll just take those core pillars

218
00:09:36,662 --> 00:09:38,443
and we'll build our stretch goals around that.

219
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:41,099
And so this is how these strategy goals came to be.

220
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,401
So if you look, you see love and hate,

221
00:09:43,461 --> 00:09:44,781
the Hall of Echoes, racial skills,

222
00:09:44,801 --> 00:09:46,102
the undead, the shape-shifting mask.

223
00:09:46,482 --> 00:09:48,803
They were all part of this better story ambition

224
00:09:48,843 --> 00:09:51,365
and this ambition of tying narrative mechanics

225
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:52,965
to the actual story.

226
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:54,826
And then obviously strategist mode

227
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:56,267
and the extra skills trees,

228
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:58,848
those fed into the combat ambitions

229
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:00,649
and modding and game master mode,

230
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:02,650
they were all there to supply

231
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,751
the multiplayer vision that we had.

232
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:06,617
So the future was bright.

233
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:08,898
Original Sin, Enhanced Edition, Definitive Edition,

234
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:12,420
sorry, Enhanced Christ, Enhanced Edition released.

235
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,501
It was very successful on PS4 and X1.

236
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:19,003
We had money, the coffers were loaded.

237
00:10:19,063 --> 00:10:20,764
We had a team, we had four studios.

238
00:10:21,785 --> 00:10:23,686
We had a direction in the form of a demo

239
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:24,906
which was called the Prospect Demo,

240
00:10:24,926 --> 00:10:27,147
which was the very first version of Original Sin 2.

241
00:10:28,248 --> 00:10:30,329
So it looked as if nothing could go wrong.

242
00:10:31,973 --> 00:10:35,274
All right, so let's start with the story,

243
00:10:35,494 --> 00:10:37,195
which is arguably probably the thing

244
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:39,856
that went wrong the most throughout the entire development

245
00:10:39,896 --> 00:10:41,817
and had an impact on a tremendous amount of things.

246
00:10:43,418 --> 00:10:45,419
So these are actually the very first

247
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,459
origin stories that we had.

248
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:49,241
These were present in the prospect point demo,

249
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:51,782
so the one that we used for Kickstarter

250
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:53,803
and that we demonstrated to multiple journalists

251
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:56,464
and which we used to show if you were that person,

252
00:10:56,504 --> 00:10:58,445
suddenly all of the dialogues were going to change

253
00:10:58,885 --> 00:11:00,406
in the game because you became that person

254
00:11:00,446 --> 00:11:01,066
for the game world.

255
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:04,486
Now, Original Sin 1 had very little character development,

256
00:11:04,526 --> 00:11:06,307
especially when it came to the companions,

257
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:09,369
and we isolated this as a very real problem.

258
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:12,950
So the brief was for each character in Original Sin 2,

259
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,491
you needed to have what we called

260
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,131
a fear, loss, betrayal, or wound.

261
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:20,233
You needed to have a mask or a way of coping with that,

262
00:11:20,773 --> 00:11:23,095
a mask for this fear, loss, betrayal, or wound,

263
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:25,115
or a compensation mechanism

264
00:11:25,155 --> 00:11:26,616
for this fear, loss, betrayal, or wound,

265
00:11:26,676 --> 00:11:27,977
and that was the thing that was gonna grow

266
00:11:28,377 --> 00:11:29,037
throughout the game.

267
00:11:29,646 --> 00:11:32,367
And this would give depth to the characters.

268
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:35,749
We wanted each character to have quirks and eccentricities.

269
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:37,510
They had to have interesting aesthetics.

270
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,051
They needed to have a good backstory,

271
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,792
one that you would understand in just one line.

272
00:11:41,772 --> 00:11:44,334
They needed to have motivations to go into conflict

273
00:11:44,354 --> 00:11:45,774
with the other characters in the game

274
00:11:45,815 --> 00:11:47,335
because we had this PVP ambition.

275
00:11:48,036 --> 00:11:51,237
And they needed to have a story that was properly formed

276
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:54,279
along according to an act one, two, and three structure.

277
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,541
Now, it took us quite some time.

278
00:11:58,181 --> 00:11:59,382
to develop these origin stories,

279
00:11:59,402 --> 00:12:01,003
and there were many reasons, we'll talk about them.

280
00:12:02,404 --> 00:12:05,066
One of the biggest problems, as a heads up,

281
00:12:05,126 --> 00:12:07,308
was the fact that we had to make this work in multiplayer.

282
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,090
And if you've played Original Sin 2,

283
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,992
you know that we have drop-in, drop-out multiplayer.

284
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,875
So that means that, and sorry, I forgot one thing.

285
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,716
In Original Sin 2, you could also,

286
00:12:18,477 --> 00:12:21,740
we had this ambition that if you picked an origin story

287
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,321
that was fine, you became that origin story.

288
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,361
But if you didn't pick it, you would encounter

289
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:27,922
the origin stories that you didn't pick in the game world

290
00:12:27,962 --> 00:12:29,582
and you could recruit them, which essentially meant

291
00:12:29,622 --> 00:12:31,502
that we had a first person and a third person view

292
00:12:31,662 --> 00:12:34,283
on the same stories and we had to implement that.

293
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:37,164
And that led to interesting problems

294
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,424
because we have drop-in drop-out multiplayer,

295
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:41,844
so that means that if you start playing with an avatar,

296
00:12:42,164 --> 00:12:43,305
when you pick an origin story

297
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:44,865
and you recruit a couple of companions,

298
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:46,705
and then you have a friend that joins in

299
00:12:46,825 --> 00:12:48,286
and he becomes one of those companions,

300
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:49,566
the story had to rotate.

301
00:12:49,646 --> 00:12:51,666
It had to go from first person to third,

302
00:12:51,706 --> 00:12:53,046
from third person to first person.

303
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:56,869
which was pretty insane, but cool.

304
00:12:57,729 --> 00:13:00,891
So it took us until eight months before release

305
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:02,712
until we actually figured out how to do this.

306
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:06,234
We've tried and we tried and tried

307
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,576
and we couldn't understand why we were having

308
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:11,957
such a hard time, but it took a very long time

309
00:13:11,997 --> 00:13:14,899
because it turns out that to be able to make it work

310
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,400
like it worked in original Cintu,

311
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,701
you need to do a lot of things.

312
00:13:17,821 --> 00:13:20,002
And it was so many things that we kept on looking for.

313
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:23,563
for simpler solutions until we actually accepted the fact

314
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,163
that there is no simple solution,

315
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:26,444
we're gonna have to do it the hard way.

316
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:31,505
So one of the main problems we had with these origin stories

317
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:33,806
was determining who were you going to be,

318
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,066
what was going to make you special.

319
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:38,807
And it was very easy to come up with a reason

320
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:40,547
for an origin story to be special,

321
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:42,408
but it was very hard to make that work

322
00:13:42,848 --> 00:13:44,828
with a reason that was also going to apply

323
00:13:44,888 --> 00:13:47,309
to custom characters which did not have an origin story.

324
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:48,930
Because when you create a character,

325
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:51,311
you could pick up either an origin story,

326
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,312
like the Red Prince or Fane or whatever.

327
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,893
But you could also create a character and say,

328
00:13:55,913 --> 00:13:57,174
you know what, I'm going to be a scholar,

329
00:13:57,574 --> 00:14:01,216
and I'm going to be a jester.

330
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:04,798
And that's going to be my role in the game.

331
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:06,759
And the game is going to have to make sure

332
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,880
that I also feel special.

333
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,722
And I don't know why we had such a hard time,

334
00:14:11,322 --> 00:14:13,003
but we had, because it took us a long time.

335
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:14,664
I think one of the reasons was that

336
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:17,106
we tried to avoid any of the tropes.

337
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:18,667
So we wanted to be special,

338
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:20,288
and we had a team of nine writers,

339
00:14:20,328 --> 00:14:21,909
so we figured with nine writers,

340
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:23,390
we're gonna figure out something awesome.

341
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,690
So I kept on giving people time,

342
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:25,871
trying to look for something.

343
00:14:26,431 --> 00:14:27,912
In the end, we ended up with a trope,

344
00:14:29,053 --> 00:14:30,434
but it worked well enough.

345
00:14:30,914 --> 00:14:34,857
But it took very long to get this specialness

346
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:37,979
in working in the game, let's put it that way.

347
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,101
Another problem that we had,

348
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:43,703
Larin is a company that's been built to work bottom up

349
00:14:43,743 --> 00:14:45,965
so that everybody owns part of the game

350
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,926
and can come up with their IDs.

351
00:14:48,006 --> 00:14:49,727
And the general tendency is that

352
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:51,168
if somebody has a better ID,

353
00:14:51,188 --> 00:14:52,749
then someone else will take the better ID.

354
00:14:52,969 --> 00:14:56,392
And another tendency is that we try to make it better

355
00:14:56,412 --> 00:14:57,432
and better continuously.

356
00:14:58,287 --> 00:14:59,967
And so that's why we listen to any ID.

357
00:15:00,488 --> 00:15:01,828
And so we started with this attitude

358
00:15:02,628 --> 00:15:05,210
when we started making the core story for Original Sin 2.

359
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,051
And so because we were distributed over the globe,

360
00:15:09,751 --> 00:15:11,512
we started relying heavily on Google Docs,

361
00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:13,933
which has these awesome collaborative features

362
00:15:14,193 --> 00:15:16,494
and this awesome commenting thread feature.

363
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,295
And so in the beginning,

364
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,636
the story was open for everybody.

365
00:15:20,176 --> 00:15:21,777
So we had the scripters, we had the programmers,

366
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:22,437
we had the artists,

367
00:15:22,497 --> 00:15:24,077
everybody was making comments about the story.

368
00:15:24,398 --> 00:15:25,978
All these comments were conflicting with each other.

369
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:30,843
And we're very polite people and we answer to every single one of these comments.

370
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:37,109
So several months of answering on comments and not making any progress led to the decision

371
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:41,974
that we kicked out everybody except the writers and then we started continuing to work on

372
00:15:42,014 --> 00:15:42,435
the story.

373
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:46,499
But we had nine writers and it turns out that nine writers don't agree about anything either.

374
00:15:48,753 --> 00:15:50,935
So they just kept on arguing and arguing.

375
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:52,616
And we kept on patching, patching, patching

376
00:15:52,636 --> 00:15:54,417
on top of the arguments just to please everybody.

377
00:15:54,437 --> 00:15:58,039
And then when you read what the resultant was, it was shit.

378
00:15:58,539 --> 00:15:59,740
So it wasn't very good.

379
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:03,743
So finally, the politeness went out of the window.

380
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:07,975
We brought it to a very small group, basically two persons.

381
00:16:08,715 --> 00:16:12,017
And when we did that, suddenly everything

382
00:16:12,057 --> 00:16:13,198
flowed very, very rapidly.

383
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:17,000
Obviously, we'd built already an insane amount of stories.

384
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,102
There's literally thousands and thousands and thousands

385
00:16:19,122 --> 00:16:20,923
of pages of course story that have been written.

386
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:23,784
So we had an enormous database to take ideas from.

387
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:25,886
And it suddenly all clicked.

388
00:16:26,546 --> 00:16:28,548
And as it all clicked, we suddenly figured out,

389
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:30,670
oh my God, this is how we have to do the origin stories.

390
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,952
And we suddenly had a solution.

391
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,053
And fortunately, this was,

392
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:36,295
core story was finished 10 months before release,

393
00:16:36,415 --> 00:16:37,536
origin stories were finished

394
00:16:37,656 --> 00:16:38,998
eight to nine months before release.

395
00:16:39,358 --> 00:16:42,100
System was invented eight to nine months before release.

396
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:48,072
So, the fact that our narrative was taking so long,

397
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:49,492
the fact that we hadn't figured out

398
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,274
how to do the origin moments,

399
00:16:51,394 --> 00:16:54,055
obviously had an impact on the,

400
00:16:54,615 --> 00:16:57,417
oh, I forgot to click on the thing with the timer.

401
00:16:58,078 --> 00:16:59,378
Okay, well, I'll figure it out.

402
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,880
Sorry, so I have no idea how much time

403
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,800
I've been taking so far.

404
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:08,884
So, the narrative delays that we've incurred

405
00:17:08,924 --> 00:17:10,785
had an impact on the rest of the production, of course.

406
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:14,307
And so we started with the things that we were sure of,

407
00:17:14,748 --> 00:17:16,129
and we said, well, we'll just fill in,

408
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,750
and we'll confirm this is ready.

409
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,111
You can start producing on this bit,

410
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:20,532
because that's not gonna change anymore,

411
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:22,153
and that's not gonna change anymore,

412
00:17:22,193 --> 00:17:23,854
because of course, it changed all the time.

413
00:17:24,635 --> 00:17:27,617
And so the scripters who needed situations and scripts,

414
00:17:27,677 --> 00:17:29,518
and the dialogue writers who needed dialogues to write,

415
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,920
they got used to the fact like,

416
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,121
well, let's implement this,

417
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:35,162
and then a month later, they got an update,

418
00:17:35,182 --> 00:17:36,683
and said, well, this changes, and this changes,

419
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:37,304
and this changes.

420
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:39,705
Maybe you have to remove the situation,

421
00:17:39,745 --> 00:17:41,286
you have to add to the situation,

422
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:45,347
and it led to something that was very frustrating for them.

423
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,949
One of the problems, or the bigger problems,

424
00:17:48,469 --> 00:17:51,210
that we had was the way that we documented everything.

425
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:53,781
So you're seeing two documents here.

426
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:56,623
I think you're looking, I can't see it on my screen,

427
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:59,925
but you're looking at, yeah, you're looking at

428
00:17:59,986 --> 00:18:01,687
what was called the narrative design doc.

429
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:04,970
We had the core story document, which was about 100 pages,

430
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,471
and then we had the narrative design doc,

431
00:18:06,491 --> 00:18:08,432
which talked about every situation

432
00:18:08,472 --> 00:18:09,433
that you found in the game.

433
00:18:10,054 --> 00:18:12,075
And then you had a QA doc,

434
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,077
which basically contained the flowcharts

435
00:18:14,137 --> 00:18:15,818
and all of the permutations that you needed to do

436
00:18:15,878 --> 00:18:17,099
to be able to test the situation.

437
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:21,915
Now, we started with big ambitions on all of this documentation and we put a lot of

438
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:25,860
effort into it, but of course every single time we changed the story, we had to propagate

439
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,824
those changes and then obviously mistakes were being made.

440
00:18:28,884 --> 00:18:33,009
So things were not making it into one of the documents and that led to the situation where

441
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:34,891
QA starts testing something and says, eh.

442
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:37,373
there's nothing to do with what's actually in the game.

443
00:18:38,094 --> 00:18:39,375
And given that at the end of the game,

444
00:18:39,415 --> 00:18:41,517
we had situations where we were running out of time,

445
00:18:41,557 --> 00:18:42,998
documentation was not being updated,

446
00:18:43,078 --> 00:18:45,360
so it essentially was one gigantic mess

447
00:18:46,061 --> 00:18:48,122
and took quite some time to clean it up.

448
00:18:48,903 --> 00:18:51,425
So the interesting bit about this is that

449
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:53,587
we were very well aware of it.

450
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:56,870
We tried changing the process during production, we failed.

451
00:18:57,351 --> 00:18:59,293
We had months of discussion after production

452
00:18:59,313 --> 00:19:00,675
about how to do it.

453
00:19:00,775 --> 00:19:02,697
We tried something else, it was a disaster.

454
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:05,620
And we are still iterating through the documentation

455
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,761
process how to handle this.

456
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:08,483
This is not a very easy problem to solve.

457
00:19:08,944 --> 00:19:10,706
We have something now that we think works,

458
00:19:10,886 --> 00:19:12,528
but maybe I'll be here in two years

459
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,409
and I'll tell you don't do this.

460
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:14,270
So.

461
00:19:17,815 --> 00:19:21,856
We had invested quite a bit in increasing the size

462
00:19:21,896 --> 00:19:24,016
of our scripting team because on original SIN one,

463
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:26,537
we saw that we were undercapacitated.

464
00:19:26,577 --> 00:19:28,277
And so we said, you know what, we have a bit of money,

465
00:19:28,357 --> 00:19:30,017
so let's dope ourselves and let's make,

466
00:19:30,157 --> 00:19:31,698
have more scripters than we're going to need.

467
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,718
Obviously, as we kept on changing the story,

468
00:19:34,978 --> 00:19:37,239
that margin became smaller and smaller and smaller,

469
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:40,700
and eventually we became actually undercapacitated.

470
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,120
Now, the way that we had organized our scripting was

471
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:44,801
we had

472
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:50,029
later in production, because initially we had much more maps, but at a certain moment in production,

473
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:56,437
we had three main acts, Act 1, Act 2, and Act 3. And so we said, okay, well, one studio is going to

474
00:19:56,457 --> 00:20:00,341
work on Act 1, one studio is going to work on Act 2, and one studio is going to work on Act 3, and

475
00:20:00,361 --> 00:20:04,065
then we're going to review that, and this way we're going to make the game in parallel, and we're going

476
00:20:04,085 --> 00:20:07,469
to be very clever about this, and we're going to finish all of this in no time.

477
00:20:08,871 --> 00:20:10,533
Obviously it didn't work.

478
00:20:10,573 --> 00:20:14,118
The reason why it didn't work was not because the scripters were doing a bad job, but they

479
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,864
weren't getting feedback because the one thing that we hadn't paralyzed was the review process.

480
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:22,210
So reviews were happening by a small group of people, typically the leads and myself.

481
00:20:23,112 --> 00:20:27,375
And we just didn't have enough time to do it all.

482
00:20:27,515 --> 00:20:28,896
On top of that, the different time zones

483
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,398
suddenly started working against us

484
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:32,539
because we had limited windows of time

485
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,321
that we could review with the team in Quebec

486
00:20:34,361 --> 00:20:35,202
when we were in Ghent,

487
00:20:35,282 --> 00:20:37,223
and we had limited windows of time

488
00:20:37,243 --> 00:20:38,705
that we could review when we were in Quebec

489
00:20:39,065 --> 00:20:40,846
with the guys that were in St. Petersburg and Ghent.

490
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:46,368
So decentralization of the review process was very needed,

491
00:20:46,928 --> 00:20:49,869
but it turned out that we didn't have people

492
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:51,970
inside of the company that could do this,

493
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,110
and as a result, we suffered heavily.

494
00:20:54,771 --> 00:20:56,691
We actually solved this problem at some point

495
00:20:56,811 --> 00:21:00,252
by bringing everybody together again on the same zone.

496
00:21:00,312 --> 00:21:03,953
So act one, so we put all the scripters on the same act,

497
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:06,494
well, not all of them, but most of them on the same act.

498
00:21:06,674 --> 00:21:09,295
and that made it possible to review the X in a whole.

499
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,276
And that accelerated things,

500
00:21:11,316 --> 00:21:12,916
and it's probably the thing that saved the project

501
00:21:12,976 --> 00:21:14,117
in the last year,

502
00:21:14,157 --> 00:21:16,838
because otherwise we were not going to manage.

503
00:21:17,218 --> 00:21:18,798
To give you an idea of what it means

504
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:25,260
to have a broken feedback loop with not enough reviews,

505
00:21:27,435 --> 00:21:31,736
A classic symptom was a situation that was made by one scripter, a situation that was

506
00:21:31,756 --> 00:21:32,697
made by another scripter.

507
00:21:32,877 --> 00:21:36,338
They were standing next to each other and they didn't realize what was happening in

508
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,038
the other situation.

509
00:21:37,058 --> 00:21:41,380
So somebody could say, oh, the sun is nice and everything is shiny, and next to it somebody

510
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:41,920
was dying.

511
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:48,263
And so you felt it very often, but this was one of the consequences of not having that

512
00:21:48,763 --> 00:21:49,963
review sorted out properly.

513
00:21:51,592 --> 00:21:57,016
So once we started realizing that we were in trouble

514
00:21:57,277 --> 00:21:59,498
and that we were not gonna be able to make everything

515
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,820
that we planned on, we had to make cuts.

516
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:06,744
Originally, Original Sin 2 had a map for the human lands,

517
00:22:06,944 --> 00:22:08,946
one for the dwarven lands, one for the undead,

518
00:22:08,986 --> 00:22:10,507
so basically for each of the races

519
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:11,447
that were present in the game.

520
00:22:12,268 --> 00:22:13,348
And what you're looking at here,

521
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:14,629
if you play the original Sin 2,

522
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:18,030
is a map of the human lands,

523
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,831
which contained the city of Arx,

524
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:22,132
Driftwood, and Forjoy, all on one map,

525
00:22:22,192 --> 00:22:23,852
which essentially became the entire game.

526
00:22:24,692 --> 00:22:26,373
So that gives you an idea of the level of cuts

527
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:27,954
that we had to do.

528
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:33,416
So each of these maps had a lot of action going on,

529
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:36,038
and when we cut it, we suddenly started cutting

530
00:22:36,158 --> 00:22:38,159
in what was supposed to be the real estate

531
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:39,120
for the origin stories.

532
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,700
So that meant that we had to go

533
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,501
and change our origin stories again.

534
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:45,543
So this constant ping-ponging between adapting

535
00:22:45,723 --> 00:22:47,744
to the fact that we were going to be late

536
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,745
and having to make cuts had an impact on the story.

537
00:22:50,106 --> 00:22:51,627
The fact that it had an impact on the story

538
00:22:51,687 --> 00:22:54,468
meant that the rest of the production was going to be late.

539
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:55,989
And so we struggled quite a lot with that.

540
00:22:56,818 --> 00:23:00,500
But eventually, we managed to have it under control.

541
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:06,263
Another thing that added to the stress, if you want,

542
00:23:06,783 --> 00:23:13,126
of development was that we had hired nine writers,

543
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:16,167
but these people had not a lot of experience

544
00:23:16,207 --> 00:23:17,228
in interactive dialogues.

545
00:23:17,268 --> 00:23:18,869
We only had a few people that had worked

546
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:21,910
on the previous games, and the rest came from TV,

547
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,851
from classic writing, or from television.

548
00:23:24,451 --> 00:23:27,937
And the idea was that the combination of all those writers was going to lead to something beautiful, and it did.

549
00:23:28,598 --> 00:23:36,951
But we underestimated how much training they were going to need to actually implement all of the dialogue trees that would fulfill all of the ambitions that we had.

550
00:23:38,479 --> 00:23:41,542
And so this is an example of a dialogue tree.

551
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:43,424
The tricky thing about this is that when you zoom in

552
00:23:43,484 --> 00:23:44,645
on one of those dialogue notes,

553
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:46,887
there's still a whole bunch of stuff happening

554
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:49,090
inside of those dialogue notes that needs to be filled in.

555
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,472
And so there were all the fights between,

556
00:23:51,512 --> 00:23:53,855
well, fights, discussions between our scripters

557
00:23:54,335 --> 00:23:55,536
and our writers.

558
00:23:55,576 --> 00:23:57,498
The scripters typically set up a situation.

559
00:23:58,139 --> 00:23:59,920
They put all the flags and conditions correct.

560
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,980
And then the writers were supposed to expand on that.

561
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:04,881
And then typically they broke all of the flags

562
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:05,481
and the conditions.

563
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:07,002
And then it went back to the scripter

564
00:24:07,022 --> 00:24:08,542
who complained that they broke everything.

565
00:24:08,602 --> 00:24:10,163
And then it went back to the writer.

566
00:24:10,183 --> 00:24:11,503
And the writer said, well, this is not cool,

567
00:24:11,523 --> 00:24:12,183
so I'll change it.

568
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,044
And then we came and we said, well, we changed the story.

569
00:24:14,064 --> 00:24:15,524
Can you please change the dialogue?

570
00:24:16,064 --> 00:24:18,345
And so like this, yeah, there was a bit of stress.

571
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:21,306
And then an interesting thing happened.

572
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:30,266
And at the beginning of 2017, this was nine months before release,

573
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:33,632
we said, OK, we're not going to be ready,

574
00:24:33,812 --> 00:24:35,556
because we originally planned on releasing in June 2017.

575
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,522
And we were talking about what cuts we were gonna make

576
00:24:39,582 --> 00:24:41,163
to still manage to be ready.

577
00:24:41,723 --> 00:24:43,124
But then another thing happened.

578
00:24:43,144 --> 00:24:45,686
There was, we're a company that looks very heavily

579
00:24:45,886 --> 00:24:47,867
at the timeline of competitors,

580
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:49,288
of what they're gonna be releasing when,

581
00:24:49,449 --> 00:24:52,170
because we prefer to release in what's called the blue ocean.

582
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:53,591
We don't like to go in the red ocean

583
00:24:53,611 --> 00:24:55,313
where everybody's fighting with each other.

584
00:24:55,973 --> 00:24:57,914
And there was a game, Shadow of War,

585
00:24:58,135 --> 00:24:59,135
which was going to be released,

586
00:24:59,235 --> 00:25:00,516
and we were very afraid of that one

587
00:25:00,536 --> 00:25:02,558
because we analyzed it as being

588
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:07,422
game that was going to talk to the same target audience,

589
00:25:07,462 --> 00:25:09,023
and so we wanted to stay away from it.

590
00:25:09,564 --> 00:25:11,546
And they were moving around with their release dates,

591
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:12,506
so we're like, eh, no.

592
00:25:13,908 --> 00:25:15,549
And another thing was happening,

593
00:25:15,589 --> 00:25:17,471
because there was other games that we fought

594
00:25:17,491 --> 00:25:19,353
that appealed to the same target audience,

595
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:19,653
and they were.

596
00:25:19,753 --> 00:25:23,817
all announcing their release dates and they were all taking up all the spots that everybody

597
00:25:23,837 --> 00:25:28,002
had analyzed on the timeline as being Blue Oceans and said, holy hell, we need to say

598
00:25:28,282 --> 00:25:32,027
our release date. If we don't tell the people our release date, they're going to take every

599
00:25:32,067 --> 00:25:35,430
spot and then we're going to end up going against someone. So we announced that we're

600
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,471
going to release in September.

601
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,773
and that was our release date, and lo and behold,

602
00:25:40,793 --> 00:25:42,574
you saw other people starting to move their release dates

603
00:25:42,634 --> 00:25:43,554
around us, so that was good.

604
00:25:45,035 --> 00:25:49,637
And Shadow of War had their release date two weeks later,

605
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:51,077
so that stressed us out.

606
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:55,879
So we move our release date because we're in trouble

607
00:25:55,939 --> 00:25:58,340
because we have too much work, and what do we do?

608
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,080
We say, hey, we have more time.

609
00:26:05,642 --> 00:26:09,506
So why don't we voice record everything, right?

610
00:26:11,248 --> 00:26:12,008
Which was not planned.

611
00:26:12,589 --> 00:26:14,611
We wanted to, but we said, okay, we just can't do it.

612
00:26:14,631 --> 00:26:16,472
We don't have enough time because then the script

613
00:26:16,532 --> 00:26:18,314
is not ready and nothing's coming out.

614
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:21,137
But why don't we voice record everything?

615
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,639
So we took a napkin and we started calculating.

616
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:24,540
And he said, you know what?

617
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,682
I mean, act one is pretty much finished

618
00:26:26,742 --> 00:26:27,903
because it's out on early access

619
00:26:27,983 --> 00:26:29,965
and people are enjoying it.

620
00:26:30,485 --> 00:26:31,706
we pretty much have a good idea now

621
00:26:31,726 --> 00:26:32,626
of what we're gonna be doing,

622
00:26:32,746 --> 00:26:34,126
so we're not gonna lose all that time.

623
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:36,507
The writers have figured out the tone of voice of the game,

624
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:37,727
so they're gonna manage to write.

625
00:26:38,247 --> 00:26:40,508
So why don't we hire multiple studios

626
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:41,448
to do the recording in,

627
00:26:42,428 --> 00:26:45,429
and just finish the script as they're already recording,

628
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:46,549
and then feed them the lines.

629
00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:48,410
Let's make an automated system

630
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,650
that's gonna be able to handle that,

631
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:52,051
and should work, right?

632
00:26:52,091 --> 00:26:54,131
It's a piece of cake, and worst case, plan B,

633
00:26:54,471 --> 00:26:55,351
you always need a plan B,

634
00:26:55,671 --> 00:26:57,772
we'll add a third or a fourth studio.

635
00:26:57,872 --> 00:26:58,492
How hard can it be?

636
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:05,893
So we learned from DOS 2 that it was important to have,

637
00:27:06,053 --> 00:27:07,814
sorry, DOS 1, that it was important to have

638
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,055
a automated pipeline for doing your voice recordings.

639
00:27:11,695 --> 00:27:15,517
And so we had a system, we had some changes made to it,

640
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:16,997
and we said, oh, let's do a field test

641
00:27:17,037 --> 00:27:18,378
to see if we can actually handle this.

642
00:27:19,118 --> 00:27:21,639
And the field test was, it was successful.

643
00:27:21,699 --> 00:27:25,361
The script was generated from a build server,

644
00:27:25,681 --> 00:27:27,161
and that build server ran at night.

645
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,521
And then in the morning, he had a voice script

646
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:32,985
that collected text from all kinds of files,

647
00:27:33,305 --> 00:27:34,806
and you could send that to the voice studio,

648
00:27:34,826 --> 00:27:37,729
and the voice studio had UUIDs that they had to associate

649
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:40,212
with the clips that they were recording,

650
00:27:40,252 --> 00:27:41,993
and then they uploaded it to a server,

651
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:44,616
they sent it back to us, we imported it on the build server,

652
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:46,858
and the next day, everything was inside of the game.

653
00:27:46,918 --> 00:27:49,901
So, seemed to be a very good system.

654
00:27:50,662 --> 00:27:56,585
And we knew, of course, that if we were going to still continue to write on the game, as they were recording, there was going to be wastage.

655
00:27:57,626 --> 00:28:04,309
But, you know, we said it's the downsides are vastly outweighed by the upsides of doing full voice on the entire game.

656
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:16,316
So here's an email that I'll let you read that we sent to...

657
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:17,937
Sorry, the email I have...

658
00:28:18,817 --> 00:28:20,057
It's not email, sorry, excuse me.

659
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:25,021
So by the end of June,

660
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:29,564
no, I'm sorry, I can't see it, so this is my problem.

661
00:28:31,325 --> 00:28:31,545
Okay.

662
00:28:32,746 --> 00:28:35,488
So this is the calculation that we did, all right?

663
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,269
So we figured that we were gonna have...

664
00:28:38,188 --> 00:28:41,530
Act one finished in a certain time, act two in a certain time, act three in a certain

665
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,952
time, that we're going to be able to calculate everything.

666
00:28:44,653 --> 00:28:51,898
And on June 28th, we told the voice studio that the recording was going to have to be

667
00:28:52,138 --> 00:28:53,479
around something around 600,000 words.

668
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,142
And on July 12th, we had an emergency call with them to tell them, well, it's not 600,000

669
00:28:57,182 --> 00:28:58,583
words, it's going to be a million words.

670
00:29:01,502 --> 00:29:06,246
And to be precise, it was 1,079,562 words,

671
00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:09,508
which was a bit more than we bargained for.

672
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,591
And so you may wonder, how the hell do you end up

673
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:13,591
in a situation like that?

674
00:29:13,631 --> 00:29:15,693
And that's a question we talked about a lot.

675
00:29:17,054 --> 00:29:18,615
So it began with a word count.

676
00:29:18,996 --> 00:29:21,818
Now, to explain everything that happened,

677
00:29:21,838 --> 00:29:24,140
you need to understand how we design our situations.

678
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,102
So we have this concept, which we call n plus one design.

679
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:32,928
An N plus one design basically means there's N permutations or N ways that you can solve a quest.

680
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:35,130
And then there's always a fallback situation.

681
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:42,257
The reason why we always have that fallback situation is because we have a very open game in which player agency is everything.

682
00:29:42,557 --> 00:29:45,720
And that means that killing an NPC is, for instance, something that should be possible.

683
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:52,187
As a matter of fact, you should always be able to kill any protagonist, any antagonist in the game, with very, very, very few exceptions.

684
00:29:52,807 --> 00:29:55,748
And what that means is that even if you have a very nice story that you're trying to tell,

685
00:29:55,808 --> 00:30:00,390
the player might come in, launch an Armageddon spell, kill everything, and you still have

686
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:05,252
to be able to tell your main story to the player, and he expects to be able to continue

687
00:30:05,652 --> 00:30:06,272
throughout the game.

688
00:30:07,032 --> 00:30:12,074
So N plus 1 design is a solution to that, and our scripters are expected to make every

689
00:30:12,094 --> 00:30:17,936
single situation bulletproof, put armor on it, make sure that it has all the requirements

690
00:30:17,956 --> 00:30:18,836
of N plus 1 design.

691
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,541
So, scripters obviously are humans,

692
00:30:23,482 --> 00:30:27,545
and as they are going through a development pipeline

693
00:30:27,565 --> 00:30:28,925
where the story is changing all the time,

694
00:30:28,945 --> 00:30:29,986
they start taking shortcuts.

695
00:30:30,006 --> 00:30:32,268
They say, you know what, I'm gonna put this situation

696
00:30:32,308 --> 00:30:35,690
in, I'll script it, and then I'll just wait for them

697
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:38,652
to be 100% sure that the situation is fixed,

698
00:30:38,692 --> 00:30:40,353
and then I'll put my N plus one design on it.

699
00:30:40,393 --> 00:30:42,154
Otherwise, I'm just gonna lose way too much time,

700
00:30:42,194 --> 00:30:43,055
and I know how this goes.

701
00:30:43,976 --> 00:30:47,963
So by the time they started realizing, oh, they're actually serious, they want to release

702
00:30:47,983 --> 00:30:51,310
the game, and they actually know what the story is, which is cool, so we can actually

703
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,753
finish our work, let's put in the n plus 1 design permutations.

704
00:30:52,773 --> 00:30:52,893
Boom.

705
00:30:52,913 --> 00:30:52,993
Boom.

706
00:30:53,013 --> 00:30:53,093
Boom.

707
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:53,214
Boom.

708
00:30:53,234 --> 00:30:53,334
Boom.

709
00:30:53,354 --> 00:30:53,434
Boom.

710
00:30:53,454 --> 00:30:53,554
Boom.

711
00:30:53,574 --> 00:30:53,674
Boom.

712
00:30:53,694 --> 00:30:53,795
Boom.

713
00:30:53,815 --> 00:30:53,915
Boom.

714
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:54,015
Boom.

715
00:30:54,035 --> 00:30:54,115
Boom.

716
00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:54,216
Boom.

717
00:30:54,256 --> 00:30:54,336
Boom.

718
00:30:54,356 --> 00:30:54,436
Boom.

719
00:30:54,456 --> 00:30:54,536
Boom.

720
00:30:54,556 --> 00:30:54,676
Boom.

721
00:30:54,696 --> 00:30:54,777
Boom.

722
00:30:54,797 --> 00:30:54,877
Boom.

723
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:54,977
Boom.

724
00:30:54,997 --> 00:30:55,117
Boom.

725
00:30:55,137 --> 00:30:55,217
Boom.

726
00:30:55,238 --> 00:30:55,318
Boom.

727
00:30:55,338 --> 00:30:55,418
Boom.

728
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:55,538
Boom.

729
00:30:55,558 --> 00:30:55,638
Boom.

730
00:30:55,658 --> 00:30:55,738
Boom.

731
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:55,839
Boom.

732
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:55,939
Boom.

733
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:56,039
Boom.

734
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,291
Right, like literally a nuclear explosion.

735
00:30:58,872 --> 00:31:02,034
The scripter, because N plus one design often means

736
00:31:02,054 --> 00:31:03,674
like let's copy, paste, copy, paste,

737
00:31:03,715 --> 00:31:04,815
diggity, diggity, diggity,

738
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:06,436
but there's lines appearing everywhere.

739
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,837
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

740
00:31:08,577 --> 00:31:11,719
And the scripter, the way that we work

741
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:13,000
is the scripter stops the lines,

742
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,321
so he puts it between brackets,

743
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:16,442
and then the writer afterwards knows

744
00:31:16,622 --> 00:31:18,083
that if it's between brackets,

745
00:31:18,103 --> 00:31:19,444
he needs to replace the line,

746
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,785
except we had never made a dashboard

747
00:31:22,825 --> 00:31:24,446
that counted the amount of stop lines.

748
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:26,848
So a lot of this was invisible for us.

749
00:31:27,008 --> 00:31:29,269
We didn't see what was happening, but it was happening.

750
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:32,490
And a producer that started noticing,

751
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,291
and he first thought that his database was broken

752
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:35,691
because he's like, so this is impossible,

753
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:37,072
I'm doing double accounts, something like that.

754
00:31:37,935 --> 00:31:42,178
And another reason why the number of words was exploding

755
00:31:42,218 --> 00:31:44,440
was in each of those notes, if you remember

756
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,421
that dialog design tree that I showed you,

757
00:31:47,181 --> 00:31:50,304
we had actually not one line of text,

758
00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:52,305
we had multiple lines of text for each of the tags

759
00:31:52,325 --> 00:31:53,245
that the players could have.

760
00:31:53,285 --> 00:31:55,547
So if you were a lizard, you would have a line.

761
00:31:55,607 --> 00:31:56,888
If you were a human, you would have a line.

762
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,149
So and that, the scripters had also postponed,

763
00:31:59,229 --> 00:32:00,350
or the writers had postponed.

764
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,611
So that was being added.

765
00:32:01,651 --> 00:32:04,233
So that basically meant that often a line became nine lines.

766
00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:06,554
All right, and like this, our word cone just,

767
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,296
Yeah, it went all over the place.

768
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:13,398
And yeah, it was problematic.

769
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:16,960
So that wasn't the only change,

770
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,242
the only reason why word counts kept on going up

771
00:32:20,282 --> 00:32:23,344
because maybe a dialogue had then finally been finalized

772
00:32:23,384 --> 00:32:25,065
and all the n plus one cases had been done,

773
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:30,688
but there was still somebody adding extra lines to the game

774
00:32:30,728 --> 00:32:32,109
because they were, the reviewer, sorry.

775
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:35,311
We were late with the reviews and because we were late with the reviews,

776
00:32:36,052 --> 00:32:39,315
we still had feedback to give to the scripters of things that they had to

777
00:32:39,355 --> 00:32:41,937
change or feedback to give to the dialogue writers of things that they

778
00:32:41,957 --> 00:32:44,379
had to change and that too was adding to the word

779
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:47,161
count or not necessarily to the actual word count of the full game

780
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:51,225
but it meant that the lines needed to be rewritten so we had quite a lot of

781
00:32:51,865 --> 00:32:52,706
iteration going on.

782
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,180
And then, yeah, the inevitable happened.

783
00:32:57,321 --> 00:32:58,921
That voice system that we had,

784
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:01,662
and that localization system that we field tested,

785
00:33:01,982 --> 00:33:02,822
it started breaking.

786
00:33:03,042 --> 00:33:04,802
It wasn't made for such rapid iteration.

787
00:33:04,882 --> 00:33:06,203
It couldn't handle so much change.

788
00:33:06,503 --> 00:33:08,383
We kept on hacking it because we had this actor

789
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,424
that needed to be recorded,

790
00:33:09,464 --> 00:33:12,124
so we changed this or this in the pipeline,

791
00:33:12,184 --> 00:33:13,164
and eventually it went, it...

792
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,105
it all like a pudding fell into one another.

793
00:33:16,185 --> 00:33:18,165
And so we kept on patching and patching and patching it,

794
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,346
and it was quite the effort to maintain everything,

795
00:33:21,386 --> 00:33:23,887
and we certainly re-recorded all of the lines

796
00:33:23,947 --> 00:33:27,427
more than we should have, but we made progress,

797
00:33:27,607 --> 00:33:30,308
and inside the room where all the riders sat,

798
00:33:30,348 --> 00:33:32,428
you could see magic happening.

799
00:33:32,448 --> 00:33:33,608
We could see where we were heading,

800
00:33:33,668 --> 00:33:35,449
and we could see that it was worth it,

801
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,929
but the rest of the team was getting very angry at us,

802
00:33:38,009 --> 00:33:39,970
because why are you still changing it?

803
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,190
And how is it possible that even now

804
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:43,410
you don't know all your lines?

805
00:33:44,994 --> 00:33:49,738
So, and there was another cause of extra words,

806
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:51,439
which is that we were still adding features.

807
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,681
We had until September, right?

808
00:33:55,102 --> 00:33:59,005
So, we had this, this was one of our stretch goals,

809
00:33:59,025 --> 00:34:01,768
the undead, and because our origin story system

810
00:34:01,988 --> 00:34:03,689
had been so late in development,

811
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,612
we hadn't even been, we hadn't been able to start on.

812
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:08,615
the undead stretch goal.

813
00:34:08,815 --> 00:34:10,377
Now, the thing about the undead stretch goal

814
00:34:10,397 --> 00:34:11,359
is that you need to understand

815
00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:17,067
is this was to a feature that involved multiple mechanics

816
00:34:17,107 --> 00:34:18,569
and it was to be the showcase

817
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,492
of how systemic or narrative system was.

818
00:34:20,733 --> 00:34:21,994
So to explain that.

819
00:34:23,718 --> 00:34:25,739
If you were a lizard and you talk to people,

820
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:27,480
they talk to you as if you were a lizard.

821
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,640
If you were an undead, they freak the hell out

822
00:34:30,381 --> 00:34:31,421
if they were afraid of undead,

823
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:33,342
and so we had to have different behavior.

824
00:34:34,002 --> 00:34:36,643
The idea was that you were going to be able to handle this

825
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:38,364
because you would have a mask of the shapeshifters.

826
00:34:38,404 --> 00:34:39,704
The mask of the shapeshifter was cool

827
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,025
because it changed your tags,

828
00:34:41,305 --> 00:34:43,005
and it showcased that if you changed tags,

829
00:34:43,065 --> 00:34:45,066
the dialogs changed, so they rotated.

830
00:34:45,486 --> 00:34:46,827
We thought it was a very awesome feature

831
00:34:46,847 --> 00:34:48,668
because it showed exactly how deep the game was,

832
00:34:48,728 --> 00:34:50,268
and we absolutely wanted to have it in there.

833
00:34:51,029 --> 00:34:52,610
One thing that we hadn't thought of was that

834
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,372
if you were an undead and there's jokes

835
00:34:55,812 --> 00:34:58,454
or there's lines that talk about your face,

836
00:34:58,655 --> 00:35:00,036
you would have to rewrite it also

837
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:02,317
because you were an undead, even in the narrator notes,

838
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:03,659
which was something that was very rare.

839
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,682
And so this here was an example of the path

840
00:35:07,702 --> 00:35:09,643
that was done over the entire game

841
00:35:09,663 --> 00:35:10,964
to be able to handle the undead.

842
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:13,346
And it turned out there was a lot of

843
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:21,340
words describing the senses and the bodily structure of persons inside of the game.

844
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,802
So there was a lot of rewrite happening as a result of that also.

845
00:35:28,265 --> 00:35:32,788
We'd been searching for the voice and the tone of the story for more than a year,

846
00:35:33,388 --> 00:35:35,709
and we finally figured it out.

847
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:40,712
And we were all convinced, at least in the narrative and the writer team,

848
00:35:40,752 --> 00:35:43,393
that we needed to apply this throughout the entire game,

849
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:45,054
because it was going to make the game that much better.

850
00:35:45,655 --> 00:35:51,197
So we fought with the producers' heart to get all of this stuff in.

851
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:54,804
What you're looking at is what defined my summer in 2017.

852
00:35:54,984 --> 00:36:01,196
This is the file that was eventually generated somewhere in mid-July.

853
00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:05,830
It was a file with 80,000 lines of text in it,

854
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:06,771
and more than a million words.

855
00:36:07,611 --> 00:36:09,171
And the little ones that you see

856
00:36:09,452 --> 00:36:11,312
meant that something was ready to record.

857
00:36:11,692 --> 00:36:13,373
And when the little one was put there,

858
00:36:13,393 --> 00:36:14,994
it meant that the situation had been reviewed,

859
00:36:15,014 --> 00:36:16,574
the dialogue line had been reviewed, it was okay,

860
00:36:16,614 --> 00:36:18,235
we were never gonna change it again in our lives.

861
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:19,535
Which we didn't.

862
00:36:20,936 --> 00:36:23,337
But that meant that between July and August,

863
00:36:23,477 --> 00:36:25,617
as we were recording, by now in multiple studios,

864
00:36:26,818 --> 00:36:29,979
we just were going there, one, okay, this is not okay.

865
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,619
I'll change this, change this, change this.

866
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,204
And so it's fair to say that half of Original Sin 2 was written in those couple of months

867
00:36:36,925 --> 00:36:40,409
as a result of all of the delays that we've been accumulating.

868
00:36:40,609 --> 00:36:43,633
Luckily for us, we had a lot of writers and then we could handle it.

869
00:36:44,414 --> 00:36:45,855
But still, it was an insane job.

870
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,686
It was Jan, our writing director,

871
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:53,670
that to give you an idea of the level of iteration

872
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:54,711
that we applied on this game,

873
00:36:56,493 --> 00:36:57,594
one week before release,

874
00:36:58,134 --> 00:37:00,116
I said, do you think I can still get this actress?

875
00:37:00,776 --> 00:37:05,060
And we changed the middle of the origin story of Sebil,

876
00:37:06,201 --> 00:37:07,642
and indeed it was a lot better.

877
00:37:09,343 --> 00:37:10,344
And then he asked me,

878
00:37:10,504 --> 00:37:12,606
how do I do this voice recording pipeline?

879
00:37:12,686 --> 00:37:14,067
Because he didn't want to go to the producer.

880
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:16,724
and that the script had changed.

881
00:37:18,456 --> 00:37:22,598
So now imagine, yeah, so now I have this slide here

882
00:37:22,638 --> 00:37:25,080
because the producers deserve a lot of respect

883
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:30,263
for despite being grumpy and deservedly angry at us,

884
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:33,164
they did cover us at every single moment in time.

885
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,525
They made sure that everything worked.

886
00:37:34,565 --> 00:37:36,346
They figured out solutions for all of the problems

887
00:37:36,366 --> 00:37:37,187
that we encountered.

888
00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:40,648
And you can for sure say that without them,

889
00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:42,470
nothing was going to happen.

890
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:44,371
It would have been one gigantic mess.

891
00:37:45,111 --> 00:37:47,053
Now imagine that you're working at Larian Studios

892
00:37:47,093 --> 00:37:48,094
and you're working in QA.

893
00:37:49,055 --> 00:37:50,196
And you have a test plan,

894
00:37:50,576 --> 00:37:52,438
and your test plan is changing the entire time

895
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:54,940
because somebody's changing the story the entire time,

896
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,883
and even as you are supposed to test your finals,

897
00:37:57,923 --> 00:37:59,884
they're still flagging, this is ready,

898
00:38:00,005 --> 00:38:01,326
oh, this is not ready, let's change this,

899
00:38:01,406 --> 00:38:01,986
oh, this is ready.

900
00:38:02,607 --> 00:38:03,908
Your job is almost impossible.

901
00:38:04,188 --> 00:38:06,010
So our QA team was actually,

902
00:38:07,812 --> 00:38:08,432
they were amazing.

903
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:12,697
They had roadmaps that went through the game,

904
00:38:12,777 --> 00:38:14,199
that tested all of the permutations,

905
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:17,163
and they did a pretty good job,

906
00:38:17,283 --> 00:38:19,045
but it was arguably,

907
00:38:19,786 --> 00:38:21,868
well, needless to say.

908
00:38:22,722 --> 00:38:24,543
Not everything had been tested when we shipped

909
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:25,443
because it was impossible,

910
00:38:25,463 --> 00:38:27,984
because since we kept on changing things continuously.

911
00:38:28,824 --> 00:38:30,945
We did have some automation and that saved us.

912
00:38:31,405 --> 00:38:32,866
We had world testers that basically

913
00:38:32,926 --> 00:38:34,626
went over the entire game automatically.

914
00:38:34,906 --> 00:38:37,467
So there were NPCs that were doing combat automatically.

915
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:40,668
All the levels were tested automatically.

916
00:38:40,828 --> 00:38:41,729
The one thing we didn't have,

917
00:38:41,789 --> 00:38:43,189
and something that we're investing in now,

918
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,230
is something that tested the story,

919
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,370
that tested the critical path.

920
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,411
So it needed to be played.

921
00:38:47,511 --> 00:38:48,551
And the game was so large

922
00:38:49,051 --> 00:38:50,832
that if you started on Monday morning,

923
00:38:51,853 --> 00:38:55,116
of one week, then the Friday of the week after,

924
00:38:55,256 --> 00:38:56,617
you did one run through of the game.

925
00:38:56,858 --> 00:38:59,621
So you can imagine how much QA it took

926
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:01,402
just to be able to do a permutation.

927
00:39:01,462 --> 00:39:04,145
And so as a result, we didn't have that much view

928
00:39:04,205 --> 00:39:05,847
of how the entire story played out

929
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:08,289
because it just took too much time to go through it.

930
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,944
Luckily for us, it didn't matter that much that certain things didn't work because you

931
00:39:13,964 --> 00:39:16,245
couldn't necessarily notice when you played the game.

932
00:39:16,786 --> 00:39:21,830
Divinity had so much reactivity that if something didn't react, you didn't know if it was supposed

933
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,730
to react or not react.

934
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:26,654
There was only one thing where you could see it, and that was in the journal, and that's

935
00:39:26,674 --> 00:39:27,754
the one that really hurt us.

936
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:31,017
Because if you looked at the journal, a quest remained open forever.

937
00:39:31,717 --> 00:39:32,998
and that was a clear indication

938
00:39:33,018 --> 00:39:34,038
that something wasn't working.

939
00:39:34,279 --> 00:39:37,160
And that was, it actually, without that,

940
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,401
we would have had a 94 Metacritic instead of a 93,

941
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:41,382
and we got a seven out of 10,

942
00:39:41,482 --> 00:39:43,883
one seven out of 10 from Polygon, rightfully so,

943
00:39:44,043 --> 00:39:45,924
because she was on a, yeah,

944
00:39:45,944 --> 00:39:48,945
she had a really lots of problems in her questing,

945
00:39:49,025 --> 00:39:51,807
and that was actually a result of all of these changes.

946
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,447
So it's not something that I would recommend.

947
00:39:54,068 --> 00:39:56,889
On the other hand, if we wouldn't have done it,

948
00:39:57,369 --> 00:39:58,530
then the game wouldn't have been as good

949
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,591
and as well received as it was.

950
00:40:01,971 --> 00:40:09,264
So there was more going on than just a story, but story was probably the biggest thing that

951
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:12,449
went wrong during Original Sin 2. That's why I spent so much time talking about it.

952
00:40:13,291 --> 00:40:14,553
We also wanted to improve combat.

953
00:40:15,605 --> 00:40:19,770
And so we wanted to improve multiple mechanics.

954
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,592
And so we decided that the armor system should be better.

955
00:40:23,513 --> 00:40:25,856
And we were very enthusiastic about it, because we tested it.

956
00:40:25,936 --> 00:40:26,957
We tested it at PAX.

957
00:40:27,397 --> 00:40:29,820
And we saw that people instantly got how armor worked.

958
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,261
And it was very intuitive to them.

959
00:40:31,982 --> 00:40:34,824
And so we were very enthusiastic when we launched it

960
00:40:34,864 --> 00:40:36,866
on early access, except the community hated it.

961
00:40:37,006 --> 00:40:38,067
They really hated it.

962
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:39,728
They wrote books about it.

963
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:41,209
And we were very stubborn.

964
00:40:41,269 --> 00:40:42,570
We didn't want to change it because we said,

965
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,012
well, they don't understand it's so accessible,

966
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,992
everybody understands it, blah.

967
00:40:45,853 --> 00:40:48,495
And yeah, lots and lots and lots of discussions.

968
00:40:48,515 --> 00:40:50,957
There were an incredible amount of iterations

969
00:40:51,017 --> 00:40:53,880
inside of the company trying to save the armor system,

970
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,901
but essentially it remained a broken thing

971
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:56,862
and it's something we shipped with,

972
00:40:57,443 --> 00:40:58,924
and maybe we shouldn't have shipped with it

973
00:40:58,944 --> 00:41:00,225
in the way that we did.

974
00:41:00,985 --> 00:41:06,771
The problem with it was that if you combine a damage shield together with control immunity,

975
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:09,214
you limit your design space tremendously.

976
00:41:09,754 --> 00:41:12,777
And that's something that you don't really feel in the beginning of the game, which is

977
00:41:12,797 --> 00:41:17,942
what we had in Early Access, but you definitely feel it as you move towards Act 2 and Act 3.

978
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,581
Another thing over which we traded a lot were the surfaces.

979
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:26,342
We, in Original Sin 1, was the game in which you could,

980
00:41:26,562 --> 00:41:28,602
there was oil, you put fire on it, you got an explosion.

981
00:41:28,942 --> 00:41:30,323
There was water, you put electricity on it,

982
00:41:30,343 --> 00:41:33,163
you get an electrified surface, you put fire on water,

983
00:41:33,343 --> 00:41:35,704
it was going to, you were going to get a cloud,

984
00:41:35,764 --> 00:41:37,944
a steam cloud, and people liked it a lot

985
00:41:38,464 --> 00:41:40,745
because you could involve the environment in combat.

986
00:41:40,805 --> 00:41:43,465
So we figured that we should expand on this.

987
00:41:44,342 --> 00:41:46,483
And so this is one of many, many, many flowcharts

988
00:41:46,964 --> 00:41:50,486
of systems that we tried to get to surfaces better.

989
00:41:50,506 --> 00:41:54,129
And the thing was that, and we had those things executed.

990
00:41:54,189 --> 00:41:56,991
So our VFX team started putting the effects for it.

991
00:41:57,031 --> 00:41:58,813
And we had like, there was one level

992
00:41:58,853 --> 00:42:00,434
I couldn't find a screenshot back for this talk

993
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:02,075
where you had all of Fort Joy

994
00:42:02,095 --> 00:42:03,517
with all kinds of different surfaces.

995
00:42:03,657 --> 00:42:04,757
And then the game started, of course,

996
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:05,938
what does this surface do?

997
00:42:06,038 --> 00:42:07,299
And that was the core problem of it.

998
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,060
people couldn't understand what was happening

999
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,781
with the surface, it wasn't one of the basic elements.

1000
00:42:13,301 --> 00:42:14,561
So eventually we dropped all of that

1001
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:18,062
and we stuck to the surface system of original SYN 1

1002
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,902
and the only thing we added were two adjectives,

1003
00:42:21,462 --> 00:42:22,322
blessed and cursed.

1004
00:42:22,703 --> 00:42:26,783
And even, to be honest, even to this day

1005
00:42:26,823 --> 00:42:28,364
I still don't know what cursed and blessed do

1006
00:42:28,404 --> 00:42:29,464
because they changed all the time.

1007
00:42:29,524 --> 00:42:30,344
It wasn't very clear.

1008
00:42:31,104 --> 00:42:34,165
So, it was something we traded on a lot.

1009
00:42:36,131 --> 00:42:40,237
One of the biggest problems we had with early access was what was not on early access.

1010
00:42:40,297 --> 00:42:42,280
So we released Act 1 on early access.

1011
00:42:46,175 --> 00:42:47,856
And the reasoning was, we want to make sure

1012
00:42:47,876 --> 00:42:49,317
that players, when the game ships,

1013
00:42:49,937 --> 00:42:52,679
are going to have new content to play through.

1014
00:42:52,939 --> 00:42:54,920
Otherwise, there will not be any excitement

1015
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,521
if they already consumed all of the content.

1016
00:42:56,801 --> 00:42:58,683
And we had people that kept on playing, playing, playing.

1017
00:42:58,703 --> 00:43:00,524
Like, they had already stacked up hundreds of hours

1018
00:43:00,924 --> 00:43:03,466
just on the very early first act.

1019
00:43:04,506 --> 00:43:07,568
And so the problem was that we were getting a lot of data

1020
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:08,929
from the

1021
00:43:11,771 --> 00:43:14,752
for Joy from Act One, but we weren't getting any data

1022
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:15,873
from Act Two and Three.

1023
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:20,275
So to explain how we got into the problem

1024
00:43:20,295 --> 00:43:22,817
that I'm about to show you, one of our main goals

1025
00:43:23,277 --> 00:43:25,558
with the systems design was that each stat point

1026
00:43:25,858 --> 00:43:27,579
was going to matter, and that the leveling up

1027
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,421
would be a very tangible thing so that you would have

1028
00:43:31,441 --> 00:43:34,082
a continuous desire to improve your character

1029
00:43:34,123 --> 00:43:35,603
and get better equipment and better skills.

1030
00:43:36,985 --> 00:43:39,328
And we had a world with very few bottlenecks,

1031
00:43:39,348 --> 00:43:40,850
so the only way that we could guide you

1032
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:44,313
was through level scale, no, not level scaling, level gaps.

1033
00:43:44,473 --> 00:43:46,956
So if you were level two and you fought a level four creature,

1034
00:43:47,036 --> 00:43:49,198
it had to be very hard, but we still wanted you

1035
00:43:49,218 --> 00:43:50,820
to have a chance to defeat that creature

1036
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,961
because if you managed to do that

1037
00:43:52,502 --> 00:43:54,064
using the systemics of the game,

1038
00:43:54,384 --> 00:43:55,565
you were going to feel good about it.

1039
00:43:56,399 --> 00:43:59,141
So what we did is we had a very steep leveling curve,

1040
00:43:59,381 --> 00:44:01,062
so it was about 20% per level

1041
00:44:01,502 --> 00:44:03,263
of extra damage hit points and so forth.

1042
00:44:03,983 --> 00:44:07,765
And that meant that you would feel it very, very strongly

1043
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:08,606
when you went to level up.

1044
00:44:08,966 --> 00:44:10,947
But it also meant that if you were a level too high,

1045
00:44:11,047 --> 00:44:12,948
it was going to be very easy to kill something

1046
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:13,989
if it was at a lower level.

1047
00:44:14,769 --> 00:44:16,150
And that's the thing that went wrong.

1048
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:19,111
So this is data that we obtained from early access.

1049
00:44:19,151 --> 00:44:21,072
This is a heat map of where people were walking.

1050
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:24,173
This is a heat map of where people were dying.

1051
00:44:24,473 --> 00:44:26,094
And so that was really good.

1052
00:44:26,935 --> 00:44:29,696
But we didn't have this information for Act Two and Act Three.

1053
00:44:30,016 --> 00:44:32,177
And so what we did is we invited play testers

1054
00:44:32,197 --> 00:44:35,718
to the company, volunteers, to try things out.

1055
00:44:37,114 --> 00:44:38,736
and we tracked the data from them.

1056
00:44:38,996 --> 00:44:40,818
The problem was that we couldn't find a lot of volunteers

1057
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:43,000
that were ready to spend two weeks in the studio

1058
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,161
because that was the time you needed

1059
00:44:44,201 --> 00:44:45,302
to play through the entire game.

1060
00:44:46,092 --> 00:44:51,676
So the only data that we could capture was the data that we got from our internal QA.

1061
00:44:52,557 --> 00:44:57,221
And so our internal QA, they know this game very, very, very well.

1062
00:44:57,942 --> 00:45:02,085
So to give themselves an extra challenge, without telling us, they started having parties

1063
00:45:02,225 --> 00:45:03,947
of three characters instead of four characters.

1064
00:45:04,387 --> 00:45:05,268
And they went through the game.

1065
00:45:05,308 --> 00:45:06,829
And then obviously they had a bit of a challenge.

1066
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:11,673
And so what we never saw was something that became very apparent in the first week of

1067
00:45:11,733 --> 00:45:14,776
release was that the game, if you did everything.

1068
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:20,628
accrued too much experience, something that hadn't shown up in any of the tests that we

1069
00:45:20,648 --> 00:45:26,116
did before because QA was following their critical paths and we had some runs that tested

1070
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,982
everything but given the amount of time that it took to test all of it, the data never

1071
00:45:30,042 --> 00:45:30,603
really popped up.

1072
00:45:31,773 --> 00:45:34,575
game comes out, our min-maxers start doing everything

1073
00:45:34,655 --> 00:45:35,356
in the entire game.

1074
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:38,298
By the time they're at the end of act two,

1075
00:45:38,378 --> 00:45:40,579
they're two levels higher than they're supposed to be.

1076
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,980
By the time they're in act three,

1077
00:45:42,301 --> 00:45:44,202
they're way too powerful, they're just breezing through it

1078
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,283
and say, oh my god, boring.

1079
00:45:46,724 --> 00:45:49,446
And that was completely against the design that we had

1080
00:45:49,486 --> 00:45:51,607
where we wanted you to feel every single point

1081
00:45:52,287 --> 00:45:53,728
that we were putting in the level.

1082
00:45:54,109 --> 00:45:55,690
So we panicked, we literally panicked.

1083
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,472
Because we knew how important the leveling curve was.

1084
00:45:59,493 --> 00:46:00,714
And we intervened.

1085
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,736
We released the patch four days later,

1086
00:46:02,756 --> 00:46:04,939
and which we hadn't tested,

1087
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,901
and we just introduced spikes.

1088
00:46:07,602 --> 00:46:10,045
So we just upped the difficulty level

1089
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,147
in the middle of Act Two,

1090
00:46:12,028 --> 00:46:13,069
at the end of Act One,

1091
00:46:13,429 --> 00:46:15,532
and at the end of Act Two, if I'm not mistaken.

1092
00:46:15,612 --> 00:46:17,114
So these are the spikes that you're seeing there.

1093
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:20,461
It worked, it certainly worked.

1094
00:46:21,101 --> 00:46:23,544
Game became harder and our reasoning was like,

1095
00:46:23,804 --> 00:46:28,088
okay, these are the guys that played through really fast.

1096
00:46:28,128 --> 00:46:28,949
There's a whole bunch of people

1097
00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:30,570
that will play through a lot slower.

1098
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:33,793
So we're going to test the leveling curve now

1099
00:46:33,914 --> 00:46:35,155
and change it as much as possible

1100
00:46:35,515 --> 00:46:37,617
so that the people that are trailing,

1101
00:46:37,637 --> 00:46:38,638
if you want, through the game.

1102
00:46:39,381 --> 00:46:40,642
are going to have a better experience.

1103
00:46:41,182 --> 00:46:44,224
And so over time we managed to smooth it and round it

1104
00:46:44,284 --> 00:46:45,205
and we solved the problems

1105
00:46:45,245 --> 00:46:46,926
because there were some other problems going on also.

1106
00:46:47,726 --> 00:46:50,808
We got everything sorted out.

1107
00:46:50,889 --> 00:46:52,129
But it was another reminder

1108
00:46:52,149 --> 00:46:53,790
that if you don't visualize your data

1109
00:46:54,131 --> 00:46:56,752
or you don't have enough data to make decisions on,

1110
00:46:57,133 --> 00:47:00,695
it becomes really, really hard to tweak your game.

1111
00:47:02,116 --> 00:47:04,978
Here's another change that came in very late, AI 2.0.

1112
00:47:06,643 --> 00:47:09,805
So we learned from DOS 1 that our combat was very slow.

1113
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,885
People take a lot of time figuring out

1114
00:47:11,905 --> 00:47:13,326
what they're going to do and it's a lot of fun.

1115
00:47:14,566 --> 00:47:16,827
And to make sure that people wouldn't get bored

1116
00:47:16,927 --> 00:47:18,208
as they played the game,

1117
00:47:18,288 --> 00:47:20,989
we tried to make every single combat handcrafted

1118
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:22,489
and very different to the other combats

1119
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:23,709
that you were encountering in the game.

1120
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:29,612
and so the prescribed approach was to make tactical puzzles out of each combat which you could solve

1121
00:47:29,712 --> 00:47:34,153
in many many ways. Now you need to know that the approach that we have to the design of skills was

1122
00:47:34,173 --> 00:47:39,755
to introduce concepts early on then teach players how to combo them and then later on give them some

1123
00:47:39,795 --> 00:47:40,556
skills to top it off.

1124
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:46,548
And what that meant for the AI was that it was very easy to foresee what players were going to have in the beginning of the game.

1125
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,831
It became much harder in the middle of the game.

1126
00:47:48,851 --> 00:47:53,476
It became almost impossible at the end of the game because we had, I think, close to 300 skills.

1127
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:58,761
And it's also a classless game, so you can just mix and match any skill that you want.

1128
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,324
So in the past with Original Sin 1,

1129
00:48:01,364 --> 00:48:03,705
we had a very simple primitive state machine

1130
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:06,166
where it was if-then rules that were made

1131
00:48:06,206 --> 00:48:08,386
by combat designers that were going to decide

1132
00:48:08,426 --> 00:48:09,427
what the AI was gonna do.

1133
00:48:09,787 --> 00:48:11,627
And that meant that if you figured out

1134
00:48:12,748 --> 00:48:15,569
some kind of strategy that was successful against the AI,

1135
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:16,689
you could keep on doing it

1136
00:48:16,729 --> 00:48:19,790
because probably the combat designer had not applied

1137
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,551
the whole in the AI's thinking throughout the entire game.

1138
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:26,292
And so in October of 2016,

1139
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:37,067
So 3.9 a year before release we say you know we maybe should have a real AI. Now uncharacteristically

1140
00:48:37,107 --> 00:48:42,491
so I was against it because I thought it was too risky that we weren't going to manage to get it

1141
00:48:42,551 --> 00:48:46,413
done in time because there was going to be a lot of fiddling with weights and if the approach didn't

1142
00:48:46,433 --> 00:48:47,334
work we had nothing.

1143
00:48:47,915 --> 00:48:49,256
And the other thing that I didn't like about it

1144
00:48:49,276 --> 00:48:51,259
is that it meant that we actually couldn't really

1145
00:48:51,339 --> 00:48:53,181
finalize any of the combats in the game

1146
00:48:53,201 --> 00:48:55,504
until the AI was going to be ready.

1147
00:48:55,684 --> 00:48:57,086
And they told me it was going to take two months,

1148
00:48:57,106 --> 00:48:59,168
but I didn't believe a word of it.

1149
00:48:59,709 --> 00:49:00,290
Rightfully so.

1150
00:49:02,753 --> 00:49:04,815
So this was one of the cases where

1151
00:49:04,956 --> 00:49:06,578
our multi-studio structure is safe today.

1152
00:49:07,425 --> 00:49:09,889
We had a programmer working in Ghent.

1153
00:49:10,129 --> 00:49:12,732
We had one paired with him in Quebec.

1154
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:15,175
And together, they spent a 17-hour day.

1155
00:49:15,556 --> 00:49:17,859
And so they worked and worked and worked on the AI.

1156
00:49:18,479 --> 00:49:20,001
And by somewhere in January, February,

1157
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:21,203
we started having something.

1158
00:49:21,603 --> 00:49:23,546
But they did work on it like this

1159
00:49:23,846 --> 00:49:25,368
until the very end of production.

1160
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:27,630
But AI 2.0 was fantastic.

1161
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:31,192
It really added to the gameplay that was present in the game.

1162
00:49:31,392 --> 00:49:33,633
There was a whatever strategy you came up with,

1163
00:49:33,673 --> 00:49:37,054
the AI could do something cool against it.

1164
00:49:37,555 --> 00:49:40,256
It was very clever also about abusing glitches in the system

1165
00:49:40,276 --> 00:49:41,717
that we didn't even know that existed.

1166
00:49:41,957 --> 00:49:44,718
Probably the most famous example was the bartender

1167
00:49:44,738 --> 00:49:46,399
that drank all the alcohol to buff himself.

1168
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:50,822
not dealing with the content because it was in combat, right?

1169
00:49:50,842 --> 00:49:56,846
So, or we had an AI that shot a barrel of oil,

1170
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:03,030
not, sorry, an AI that shot a barrel of oil to slow you

1171
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:06,592
while you were hasted to get rid of your hasted status

1172
00:50:06,652 --> 00:50:09,334
and all these kinds of emergent behavior came from the AI.

1173
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:12,015
So I think it was a very big element in the success.

1174
00:50:12,035 --> 00:50:14,697
So I'm very happy that the programmers that argued for it

1175
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:17,038
won this particular argument.

1176
00:50:19,457 --> 00:50:23,902
So all of this problems, and there were more,

1177
00:50:23,922 --> 00:50:25,023
but I'm running out of time.

1178
00:50:26,685 --> 00:50:29,208
All of these problems obviously had an impact

1179
00:50:29,748 --> 00:50:33,012
on our release, and in our particular case,

1180
00:50:33,052 --> 00:50:35,014
we had multiple release dates.

1181
00:50:35,594 --> 00:50:37,937
Our very first release date was our Kickstarter,

1182
00:50:38,037 --> 00:50:40,399
because we went to PAX, we went to journalists,

1183
00:50:40,459 --> 00:50:41,981
we released a demo that they could play.

1184
00:50:42,722 --> 00:50:44,606
And that's how we had all of our previews.

1185
00:50:44,686 --> 00:50:46,450
Our second release date was our early access,

1186
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:47,914
because then we went to the public and we said,

1187
00:50:47,954 --> 00:50:49,658
here's act one of the game that we're trying to make.

1188
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,083
Please play it and let us know what you think.

1189
00:50:52,964 --> 00:50:54,585
Our third release date was internally called

1190
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:55,665
as Krill release date,

1191
00:50:56,025 --> 00:50:57,246
because somebody had clicked on the button

1192
00:50:58,187 --> 00:50:59,568
to release the game prematurely.

1193
00:50:59,588 --> 00:51:01,269
So this was two weeks before release.

1194
00:51:01,969 --> 00:51:04,010
Luckily, luckily we had a phone number

1195
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:06,292
from somebody at Valve that we could,

1196
00:51:06,372 --> 00:51:08,993
so that we could call to rectify it rapidly,

1197
00:51:09,013 --> 00:51:10,414
because it would have been a disaster.

1198
00:51:11,775 --> 00:51:13,056
Then we had the actual release date,

1199
00:51:13,276 --> 00:51:15,537
which in our case was plagued by power outage

1200
00:51:15,577 --> 00:51:16,358
in the entire city.

1201
00:51:16,538 --> 00:51:18,739
So we had to do all kinds of stunts

1202
00:51:18,779 --> 00:51:20,060
to get the game actually released.

1203
00:51:21,001 --> 00:51:23,445
And then we had the definitive edition release date

1204
00:51:23,485 --> 00:51:26,550
is when we came up with an improved version of the game,

1205
00:51:27,031 --> 00:51:27,993
which released last year.

1206
00:51:28,694 --> 00:51:31,359
So that was literally the fifth release date for those two.

1207
00:51:32,584 --> 00:51:35,686
Now on release, we paid the price for the word count.

1208
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:39,288
And the thing, is that on this one?

1209
00:51:39,328 --> 00:51:41,889
I think it's on the next one, yeah.

1210
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:45,011
We paid the price and that we were review bombed.

1211
00:51:45,451 --> 00:51:48,113
And we were review bombed by very angry people in Russia

1212
00:51:48,533 --> 00:51:50,634
that said, where the hell is my Russian localization

1213
00:51:50,654 --> 00:51:51,214
that you promised?

1214
00:51:51,635 --> 00:51:53,616
And we said, well, it's gonna release on 21st of September

1215
00:51:53,676 --> 00:51:56,337
because the translation companies have suffered some delays

1216
00:51:56,377 --> 00:51:57,818
because somebody has been changing the script

1217
00:51:57,858 --> 00:51:58,719
until yesterday.

1218
00:52:00,303 --> 00:52:03,804
And we haven't talked about translation,

1219
00:52:03,824 --> 00:52:05,084
but those guys were heroes also.

1220
00:52:05,104 --> 00:52:07,685
Because there's translation, there's proofreading.

1221
00:52:07,785 --> 00:52:09,065
And with a game that's this big,

1222
00:52:09,545 --> 00:52:11,226
proofreading takes a long time also.

1223
00:52:13,826 --> 00:52:14,987
And they were angry.

1224
00:52:15,047 --> 00:52:16,667
They were so angry, and you could see it.

1225
00:52:16,687 --> 00:52:18,007
So what we did is we said, you know what,

1226
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:21,968
we'll just release the beta text, right?

1227
00:52:22,068 --> 00:52:24,489
I mean, you'll see it's a really good translation.

1228
00:52:24,549 --> 00:52:25,889
It's just not 100% finished.

1229
00:52:26,429 --> 00:52:27,270
And that actually worked.

1230
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:29,410
We went to Twitch in Russia.

1231
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:32,572
We talked to Twitchers and to calm down the community.

1232
00:52:32,592 --> 00:52:33,952
We said, like, this is what they're doing.

1233
00:52:33,972 --> 00:52:36,253
They had a few problems and this blah and so forth.

1234
00:52:36,273 --> 00:52:36,694
And it worked.

1235
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:38,515
I would certainly not recommend it

1236
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:39,935
because we were at that moment,

1237
00:52:39,955 --> 00:52:42,496
we had a 96% user rating on Steam

1238
00:52:42,536 --> 00:52:44,077
and we were, I think we went down to 70

1239
00:52:44,497 --> 00:52:45,178
or something like that.

1240
00:52:45,598 --> 00:52:47,919
So we were suffering very, very, very hard.

1241
00:52:48,219 --> 00:52:49,260
But it was our own fault, of course,

1242
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,880
because we changed so many things.

1243
00:52:52,601 --> 00:52:52,821
So.

1244
00:52:54,748 --> 00:52:55,909
If you hear all of this, you would say,

1245
00:52:55,929 --> 00:52:57,170
well, what a disaster, right?

1246
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:00,252
But there's a couple of things that you need to realize

1247
00:53:00,292 --> 00:53:01,453
when you think about Originals Sin 2.

1248
00:53:01,493 --> 00:53:04,334
This is a 120-hour game that was made in two years' time.

1249
00:53:05,195 --> 00:53:07,596
So that is, I think, quite an achievement of the team.

1250
00:53:08,217 --> 00:53:11,119
And it was a game that went really right

1251
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:12,720
because it scored very, very highly.

1252
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,241
It sold very well also.

1253
00:53:14,301 --> 00:53:16,242
It's still in the charts to this date.

1254
00:53:17,603 --> 00:53:20,184
So, and it was a testimonial that all of that iteration,

1255
00:53:21,009 --> 00:53:24,691
and all that of the refusal of compromise on quality

1256
00:53:24,871 --> 00:53:27,973
that it paid off, even if it caused a few production

1257
00:53:27,993 --> 00:53:28,333
problems.

1258
00:53:29,774 --> 00:53:33,096
So my lesson was that not compromising on quality

1259
00:53:33,456 --> 00:53:34,037
is a good thing.

1260
00:53:34,257 --> 00:53:36,258
But you need to figure out how the hell you're

1261
00:53:36,278 --> 00:53:37,759
going to make your production work with it,

1262
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:39,100
because otherwise, you're going to keep

1263
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,180
on running into problems.

1264
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,601
And it's problems that you don't want to have.

1265
00:53:42,361 --> 00:53:44,002
So what are the big takeaways that we've

1266
00:53:44,042 --> 00:53:46,024
applied to our own processes on the next things

1267
00:53:46,044 --> 00:53:46,684
that we're working on?

1268
00:53:47,537 --> 00:53:48,998
and which also not all work.

1269
00:53:50,218 --> 00:53:52,340
So first thing is documentation.

1270
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,282
Balance and documentation for a big RPG is really important.

1271
00:53:56,702 --> 00:53:59,404
You're gonna spend, you're gonna create thousands of pages

1272
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,545
of documentations for QA, for your scripters,

1273
00:54:01,765 --> 00:54:02,846
even the briefs of the writers.

1274
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,767
So you have to figure out a way

1275
00:54:04,947 --> 00:54:06,748
of not having too much documentation

1276
00:54:06,788 --> 00:54:08,109
because the less documentation you have,

1277
00:54:08,149 --> 00:54:09,470
the easier it is to maintain it.

1278
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:11,811
On the other hand, you have to be able to inform everybody

1279
00:54:11,852 --> 00:54:13,192
about what's supposed to be going on.

1280
00:54:13,232 --> 00:54:14,713
So you need to have sufficient documentation.

1281
00:54:15,133 --> 00:54:16,814
This is a very, very hard problem.

1282
00:54:16,994 --> 00:54:18,595
If anybody knows a perfect solution for it,

1283
00:54:18,635 --> 00:54:20,776
please come tell me.

1284
00:54:21,276 --> 00:54:21,916
White boxing.

1285
00:54:21,956 --> 00:54:24,017
White boxing refers to the,

1286
00:54:24,517 --> 00:54:26,298
how do you make a game that you can review

1287
00:54:26,598 --> 00:54:29,759
without having to put all of the production values in there?

1288
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:32,220
It turns out that for a game like Original Sin 2,

1289
00:54:33,281 --> 00:54:39,971
it's very complicated. We've often observed that if a level design is not far enough and

1290
00:54:40,091 --> 00:54:44,778
decorated enough, a scripter is not going to put effort in making all of the permutations that he

1291
00:54:44,818 --> 00:54:46,681
needs to do. And that is...

1292
00:54:48,704 --> 00:54:52,087
Yeah, that is a very surprising thing. We've fought against this, but we never solved it.

1293
00:54:52,127 --> 00:54:57,051
So, figuring out a good white-boxing process, and I think we have one now, is very important.

1294
00:54:57,412 --> 00:55:02,796
Automation. Invest in automation as much as you can. It is the saving grace when you're iterating.

1295
00:55:03,196 --> 00:55:06,539
I mean, because if you don't have to have a human going through everything, and you have something

1296
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,041
that can automatically test your game, you're going to save so much time.

1297
00:55:10,531 --> 00:55:12,271
Your processes need to be built for iteration.

1298
00:55:12,291 --> 00:55:13,492
You need to tell people up front,

1299
00:55:13,512 --> 00:55:14,432
this is what we're going to be doing.

1300
00:55:14,492 --> 00:55:16,373
We're going to change until the end, right?

1301
00:55:16,773 --> 00:55:18,733
If you don't do it, you will have a lot of frustration,

1302
00:55:18,753 --> 00:55:19,613
you'll have a lot of fights,

1303
00:55:20,034 --> 00:55:21,334
and you can avoid a lot of these fights

1304
00:55:21,374 --> 00:55:22,854
by just being very open about it.

1305
00:55:23,675 --> 00:55:25,675
Yeah, the two-minute cook syndrome, I think that's obvious.

1306
00:55:26,315 --> 00:55:27,996
You need to have some dictatorship involved

1307
00:55:28,076 --> 00:55:30,837
in making a game, but you still have to open up the lines

1308
00:55:30,857 --> 00:55:32,397
so that people can understand what you're saying.

1309
00:55:33,896 --> 00:55:35,458
Feedback loops, we talked about that.

1310
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:36,740
Invest heavily in it.

1311
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:37,821
It's very important.

1312
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,183
Real world circumstances.

1313
00:55:40,384 --> 00:55:41,685
We saw a few examples of that.

1314
00:55:42,927 --> 00:55:44,689
Hard to organize, but definitely worth it.

1315
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:47,492
But topic on its own.

1316
00:55:49,114 --> 00:55:49,894
Never stop improving.

1317
00:55:49,914 --> 00:55:52,437
That's the thing that we really did well, I think,

1318
00:55:52,718 --> 00:55:53,739
and it paid off for us.

1319
00:55:55,145 --> 00:55:57,427
And then you have to accept that iteration takes time.

1320
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,289
There's nothing to be done about it.

1321
00:55:59,449 --> 00:56:00,990
You're never gonna get it right from the first time.

1322
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:05,153
If your production is completely production focused,

1323
00:56:05,934 --> 00:56:07,976
then you will lose opportunities to make your game better.

1324
00:56:08,196 --> 00:56:09,317
I think that when you make a game,

1325
00:56:09,337 --> 00:56:11,018
you should strive to make it as good as you can.

1326
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,460
And sometimes you have to just take risks.

1327
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,981
And they can blow up in your face.

1328
00:56:15,021 --> 00:56:16,963
I had one blow up in my face this morning, actually.

1329
00:56:18,464 --> 00:56:20,265
More to be said about that probably in the next weeks.

1330
00:56:23,207 --> 00:56:25,389
And then, yeah, visualize.

1331
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:26,429
Visualize as much as you can.

1332
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,911
Make sure that you can see data,

1333
00:56:28,931 --> 00:56:30,272
that you can see disasters happening

1334
00:56:30,312 --> 00:56:31,333
like the word count that we had.

1335
00:56:32,113 --> 00:56:32,994
And yeah.

1336
00:56:34,075 --> 00:56:37,800
So these were the top things that we used to change our processes.

1337
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:43,427
Whether or not they work, we'll see in the next postmortem, but that's going to be it for today.

1338
00:56:43,467 --> 00:56:45,309
So we have four minutes left for questions.

1339
00:56:45,329 --> 00:56:49,274
So I guess we jump to questions right away if there's any questions.

1340
00:56:50,636 --> 00:56:50,876
Thank you.

1341
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:00,870
Is this on? Hi.

1342
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:01,270
Hi.

1343
00:57:01,691 --> 00:57:04,832
Um, so, I love this game and I've played it a lot.

1344
00:57:04,912 --> 00:57:08,374
I've noticed you didn't mention Act 4 at all.

1345
00:57:08,454 --> 00:57:10,555
Did that just, like, appear?

1346
00:57:11,075 --> 00:57:12,276
How did that work?

1347
00:57:12,736 --> 00:57:14,656
No, so what we call Act 1, 2, 3

1348
00:57:15,556 --> 00:57:17,557
is basically the three act structure, the narrative one.

1349
00:57:17,997 --> 00:57:20,597
So multiple maps are actually involved in Act 2.

1350
00:57:20,897 --> 00:57:23,918
So Council of Seven and what we call RC Main,

1351
00:57:23,938 --> 00:57:26,159
which is where Driftwood is, those are all one act for us.

1352
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:26,979
Oh, okay.

1353
00:57:26,999 --> 00:57:29,079
So the last act, the one that you're referring to

1354
00:57:29,139 --> 00:57:30,480
as Act 4 is actually Act 3.

1355
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:31,640
Ah. So that's why.

1356
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:32,940
Thank you.

1357
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:33,860
All right, you're welcome.

1358
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:36,106
Good talk, thank you.

1359
00:57:36,447 --> 00:57:38,408
So I have a question about the backdoor.

1360
00:57:38,548 --> 00:57:40,989
I noticed that in the game, you can have one character

1361
00:57:41,069 --> 00:57:43,491
talking with the enemy, while the other's putting

1362
00:57:43,551 --> 00:57:46,332
something very heavy into the backpack of that enemy.

1363
00:57:46,653 --> 00:57:49,174
And so later, when the fight starts,

1364
00:57:49,794 --> 00:57:51,175
that guy could not move at all.

1365
00:57:51,295 --> 00:57:54,657
So kind of, I don't know why you have this backdoor.

1366
00:57:54,677 --> 00:57:56,038
Is that deliberately designed?

1367
00:57:56,458 --> 00:57:58,279
Because I don't believe it's simply a bug.

1368
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,801
So could you explain why you have that?

1369
00:58:02,322 --> 00:58:07,223
There are other backdoors like if you shoot in distance, at a distance,

1370
00:58:08,343 --> 00:58:15,146
you would not, your movement would not be locked, but you can, especially using the

1371
00:58:15,186 --> 00:58:19,907
sauna forest, that character, you can actually all summon a...

1372
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:21,068
We did it on purpose.

1373
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:23,148
So why do you have that?

1374
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,489
We did it because we know that players like to glitch a game,

1375
00:58:25,649 --> 00:58:29,371
so we think it's a way of promoting player agency.

1376
00:58:29,511 --> 00:58:31,232
If they figure it out, they're very proud of it.

1377
00:58:31,792 --> 00:58:33,913
It's similar like, oh, I'm gonna talk to him

1378
00:58:33,953 --> 00:58:35,253
and then I'm gonna steal everything.

1379
00:58:35,493 --> 00:58:37,414
We leave that in because we know players like it,

1380
00:58:38,374 --> 00:58:39,995
even if it's obviously an exploit.

1381
00:58:40,815 --> 00:58:41,315
Okay, so.

1382
00:58:41,456 --> 00:58:42,336
So it's literally by design.

1383
00:58:43,187 --> 00:58:44,907
Okay, what about balance?

1384
00:58:45,108 --> 00:58:48,189
Do you think it's kind of harmful to balance the game?

1385
00:58:48,449 --> 00:58:50,990
We're not really focused on the min-maxing.

1386
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,951
We think about a game as something

1387
00:58:52,971 --> 00:58:54,152
in which you should have fun,

1388
00:58:54,252 --> 00:58:56,253
especially if you're playing in cooperative multiplayer,

1389
00:58:56,293 --> 00:58:57,874
which is where most of these cases appear.

1390
00:58:58,654 --> 00:58:59,435
You just wanna play,

1391
00:58:59,895 --> 00:59:01,415
like you were playing Dungeons and Dragons, you know?

1392
00:59:01,516 --> 00:59:03,056
You're playing a pen and paper session.

1393
00:59:03,296 --> 00:59:04,097
You're goofing around.

1394
00:59:04,137 --> 00:59:04,957
You're having a lot of fun.

1395
00:59:04,977 --> 00:59:06,338
There's reasons to continue in the world.

1396
00:59:06,758 --> 00:59:08,379
And that, I think, is the most important bit

1397
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:09,319
about RPG design.

1398
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:10,980
Thank you.

1399
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:11,460
You're welcome.

1400
00:59:13,997 --> 00:59:14,197
Here?

1401
00:59:15,158 --> 00:59:16,379
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

1402
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:17,120
Sorry.

1403
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:21,564
Hello, I'm just curious how you balance the crafting

1404
00:59:22,244 --> 00:59:24,466
connected to the combat, because there is clearly

1405
00:59:24,486 --> 00:59:27,148
a connection between the two for the arrows, the bombs,

1406
00:59:27,248 --> 00:59:28,029
and this kind of shit.

1407
00:59:29,731 --> 00:59:39,176
So our crafting was one of the things that we weren't very happy about and so we think that we could have done a much better job on the crafting so this is something it's a topic on its own.

1408
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:49,261
It came later it wasn't really embedded in the full design of the game and you feel it when you play the game also so we try to do that better for definitive edition but.

1409
00:59:49,882 --> 00:59:52,664
To be fair, crafting is a real big problem when it comes to balancing.

1410
00:59:53,205 --> 00:59:56,408
And because a lot of people don't like crafting, a lot of people like crafting,

1411
00:59:56,508 --> 00:59:58,610
and it's hard to mix them.

1412
00:59:59,151 --> 01:00:01,933
So if it were up to me, I wouldn't have... well, it was up to me, so...

1413
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:07,679
But I would have to think very hard again if I would put crafting into the game.

1414
01:00:08,359 --> 01:00:10,041
Because then that solves the problem, obviously.

1415
01:00:10,742 --> 01:00:11,402
Okay, thank you.

1416
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:11,843
You're welcome.

1417
01:00:13,879 --> 01:00:16,541
You talked a bit about how you flattened the AP system,

1418
01:00:17,541 --> 01:00:20,023
but it seems like the new system would be harder to balance

1419
01:00:20,103 --> 01:00:22,264
just because you have fewer action points.

1420
01:00:22,925 --> 01:00:23,785
You lose granularity.

1421
01:00:24,286 --> 01:00:26,367
Could you talk more about why it was important to change that?

1422
01:00:27,275 --> 01:00:33,360
Yeah, so we noticed that people didn't care about the action points anymore when you had like eight or nine action points because obviously it was easy to scale.

1423
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,863
But it just you didn't feel that there was no sense that it was important.

1424
01:00:38,404 --> 01:00:42,507
With two or three action points what we saw is people were arguing, were reasoning about it.

1425
01:00:42,587 --> 01:00:45,809
I'm going to do this and then I'm going to do this and that's literally what we wanted to promote.

1426
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:49,372
So you're right I mean that just daggers on its own was already a problem, right?

1427
01:00:49,532 --> 01:00:52,875
What are you going to do? One dagger is one action point, the other one is two action points or not.

1428
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:55,918
But then what do you do with weapons that take two action points? So those kinds of discussions.

1429
01:00:56,498 --> 01:01:00,520
But we thought it was more important that people would reason about their action points

1430
01:01:01,061 --> 01:01:03,883
and we took those problems with it. We knew that that was going to be a problem.

1431
01:01:04,323 --> 01:01:05,043
Gotcha, thanks.

1432
01:01:05,063 --> 01:01:08,806
All right, well we have time for one more question, then we have to go to the wrap-up room

1433
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:12,668
according to my notes. Also you have to fill in your session evaluation things.

1434
01:01:13,188 --> 01:01:14,009
Five stars please, thank you.

1435
01:01:16,056 --> 01:01:16,557
So one last.

1436
01:01:16,577 --> 01:01:19,060
I think she was here before me.

1437
01:01:19,461 --> 01:01:22,866
You talked about reducing the too many cooks situation.

1438
01:01:22,886 --> 01:01:28,293
I was wondering if you had any more ideas or things that you did that helped the whole

1439
01:01:28,314 --> 01:01:29,375
studio get on board with that?

1440
01:01:30,677 --> 01:01:32,579
With the too many cooks, well, we explained it.

1441
01:01:33,339 --> 01:01:35,681
So we said, guys, you have to leave us alone,

1442
01:01:35,861 --> 01:01:37,462
because otherwise we can't get our stuff done.

1443
01:01:38,223 --> 01:01:42,866
And this is a really good question,

1444
01:01:42,886 --> 01:01:44,087
because it's a hard problem.

1445
01:01:44,307 --> 01:01:46,629
So on the one hand, you don't want to be top-down heavy,

1446
01:01:47,149 --> 01:01:49,331
and you want to maximize what you get from the bottom up.

1447
01:01:49,391 --> 01:01:50,272
On the other hand, you still have

1448
01:01:50,292 --> 01:01:51,152
to be able to work with it.

1449
01:01:51,252 --> 01:01:52,273
So I think this.

1450
01:01:53,073 --> 01:01:54,314
I don't have a ready solution for it.

1451
01:01:54,374 --> 01:01:55,114
I think it's a balance

1452
01:01:55,154 --> 01:01:57,095
that you're gonna have to walk continuously

1453
01:01:57,335 --> 01:01:58,956
and you're gonna have to adapt as you go

1454
01:01:58,976 --> 01:02:01,316
and you'll make mistakes, I mean, which is fine.

1455
01:02:01,497 --> 01:02:02,697
Making mistakes is fine in this.

1456
01:02:03,197 --> 01:02:04,157
And communicate a lot.

1457
01:02:04,298 --> 01:02:05,698
That's the only solution I have.

1458
01:02:05,718 --> 01:02:07,139
I mean, we're a studio that went from 40

1459
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:11,860
to we're now 200 people, which has been quite a ride,

1460
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,001
but it's also complicated our lives tremendously

1461
01:02:14,041 --> 01:02:16,802
because some of our processes are still built for 40 people

1462
01:02:16,842 --> 01:02:18,263
and that doesn't work with 200 people.

1463
01:02:18,303 --> 01:02:20,523
So we're discovering as we go.

1464
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:23,502
All right, OK, if you have any more questions,

1465
01:02:23,522 --> 01:02:24,284
we can talk about it.

1466
01:02:24,404 --> 01:02:26,007
And I don't know where the wrap-up room is,

1467
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:28,291
but there is a wrap-up room and a wrap-up room,

1468
01:02:29,033 --> 01:02:30,395
if somebody can show where the wrap-up room is.

1469
01:02:30,716 --> 01:02:31,016
Thank you.

1470
01:02:31,297 --> 01:02:31,477
All right.
