1
00:00:03,684 --> 00:00:08,070
So let's actually start off the thing and I'll have to try and speak a little bit faster

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,874
because I don't have the time that I usually have.

3
00:00:10,874 --> 00:00:15,080
Okay so, who here has played Owlboy before?

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,384
Okay so we have a good few of you, then I don't have to...

5
00:00:18,007 --> 00:00:24,031
talk too much about that. Excellent. So, my name is Simon Anderson. I am a self-trained,

6
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:29,675
well mostly self-trained artist. I'm mostly known for my pixel art, I think, but I've

7
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:36,540
done quite a few things. I've done advertisement. It was one of my first projects that I did.

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,504
I think that was 2009. I also worked on children's cartoon shows that I don't think anyone here

9
00:00:42,504 --> 00:00:43,365
has ever watched.

10
00:00:44,069 --> 00:00:46,830
They're very popular at home, I promise.

11
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,891
I've also done a good bit of freelance illustration.

12
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:53,491
So these are some of the covers that I've done.

13
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:55,272
Some of you might know those.

14
00:00:55,272 --> 00:00:59,693
And I have also, of course, worked on video games.

15
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:00,993
Some of these are previous projects.

16
00:01:00,993 --> 00:01:02,213
Some of them are out now.

17
00:01:02,213 --> 00:01:04,154
One of them is Planetoid Pioneers.

18
00:01:04,154 --> 00:01:05,434
I did a very nice intro.

19
00:01:05,434 --> 00:01:06,574
They're very thankful.

20
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:14,798
But I guess the thing I'm most known for is a little project called Owlboy.

21
00:01:14,798 --> 00:01:21,962
Now, roughly five years ago, I funded a studio called D-Pad Studio.

22
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:28,186
And, well, I work as an art director and I basically do all the art for that studio.

23
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:33,048
Practically everything. If you've ever been to the website, I unfortunately had to do that.

24
00:01:33,048 --> 00:01:35,130
I didn't code it, but I did that stuff.

25
00:01:35,993 --> 00:01:41,776
The past 2 is a number number of projects. The only one I think you

26
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:46,499
recognize from this list would be some on the scent. We also have that game in

27
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:54,763
the mid right which is project reps to be which we did before we formed a studio

28
00:01:54,763 --> 00:01:59,506
officially which I think was in 2005 shows how old we are.

29
00:01:59,506 --> 00:02:04,268
But again what I'm most known for is this thing which most of you appear to

30
00:02:04,268 --> 00:02:04,728
have played.

31
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:12,188
Now, Owlboy was an idea that I got when I was still in school,

32
00:02:12,188 --> 00:02:16,389
and this was kind of before the industry had really taken off,

33
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:22,571
and it was before the Norwegian game industry had really shown much.

34
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:26,612
We had Funcom back then, and indie development was pretty much non-existent.

35
00:02:26,612 --> 00:02:32,333
And more so, if you were going to make a living off of doing indie games,

36
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,154
that wasn't really an option at all.

37
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:41,364
So I got together with some friends and I started to work with kind of hobby

38
00:02:41,364 --> 00:02:46,887
projects and stuff that I wanted to do on my spare time. I pitched Owlboy. We

39
00:02:46,887 --> 00:02:50,669
made the glorious decision of being one of the first people to use XNA for our

40
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:56,813
game. We have now outlived that programming language. And the idea was

41
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:59,755
that we were going to...

42
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:04,477
fund the studio really quick, finish Owlboy, and then go on

43
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:07,199
to make all sorts of other things.

44
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:13,485
And the end result was that we ended up working on Owlboy for

45
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,226
quite some time.

46
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:17,229
I think this was in 2011.

47
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:20,612
They're talking about Fez not being released yet.

48
00:03:24,144 --> 00:03:30,567
And we actually managed to get Owlboy done last year in November,

49
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:39,632
which brings the total number count to eight years plus 11 months, so pretty much nine years.

50
00:03:39,632 --> 00:03:45,515
Now, a lot of people ask, why did we actually finish this project? I mean...

51
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:48,703
consider just how long of a time that is.

52
00:03:48,703 --> 00:03:52,807
And there's a number of reasons for that,

53
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:55,069
but I think the main reason is that we felt

54
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,770
really inspired to do this thing.

55
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,753
We knew what the game was going to be,

56
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:01,655
we knew how we had to do it,

57
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,176
and we knew that we could present it in a way

58
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,557
that people would find engaging,

59
00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:07,800
we just needed the amount of time for it.

60
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,062
So, what's this panel about then?

61
00:04:10,062 --> 00:04:10,142
Well.

62
00:04:12,357 --> 00:04:16,998
There's kind of plenty of panels here that tell you about very intricate design decisions

63
00:04:16,998 --> 00:04:19,999
and how to do 3D meshes and texture work and that sort of thing.

64
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:27,181
I thought I'd mix it up a little bit and talk about how you can get inspired,

65
00:04:27,181 --> 00:04:33,442
how to keep that inspiration to push through all the things you don't want to do

66
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:36,723
and then, well, finish.

67
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:41,676
And I'm going to be using examples from Owlboy all

68
00:04:41,676 --> 00:04:43,738
through the thing, so you see how I did it.

69
00:04:43,738 --> 00:04:46,340
And then maybe you can put some of that in your

70
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,821
toolbox if you want.

71
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,023
So how do we start?

72
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,885
Well, I'm going to give you some quick tips

73
00:04:51,885 --> 00:04:52,866
on how to be inspired.

74
00:04:52,866 --> 00:04:55,949
Most of you already know these things, but I'm going to

75
00:04:55,949 --> 00:04:57,190
reiterate and use examples.

76
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,034
So here's how I would improve this thing.

77
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,817
Now, most of you do this already.

78
00:05:04,585 --> 00:05:09,109
Have you ever seen a movie that wasn't quite that good?

79
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,131
Or a game that was kind of eh?

80
00:05:11,131 --> 00:05:12,712
Or a presentation with a long-haired guy

81
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:13,913
that went on for too long?

82
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:17,696
You can kind of use that as a jumping board

83
00:05:17,696 --> 00:05:22,701
to get further along with your ideas and iterate on that.

84
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:25,663
My personal favorite is to play old Game Boy Color games.

85
00:05:25,663 --> 00:05:27,665
I do this on purpose.

86
00:05:28,743 --> 00:05:33,006
That era of games, the system was so difficult to develop for

87
00:05:33,006 --> 00:05:35,187
and you had so many inexperienced developers

88
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:38,029
that you got a lot of very unfinished ideas.

89
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:40,311
And it's a gold mine to go through

90
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:43,593
if you want to find things to bounce off of

91
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,854
and find ways to iterate things on your own.

92
00:05:45,854 --> 00:05:49,216
Now, I should stipulate, if any of the developers

93
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:51,558
for these games are in the audience,

94
00:05:51,558 --> 00:05:53,179
I'm not picking on you specifically,

95
00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:54,880
I just pulled something off of Google.

96
00:05:58,174 --> 00:06:01,137
Let's see.

97
00:06:01,137 --> 00:06:03,779
So in Owlboy's case,

98
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:06,101
I had two goals.

99
00:06:06,101 --> 00:06:09,624
One was to show pixel art as a medium.

100
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:13,927
So back then pixel art wasn't viewed very well publicly.

101
00:06:13,927 --> 00:06:17,650
The whole indie development thing hasn't really started up.

102
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,472
And most people saw it as more of a

103
00:06:20,472 --> 00:06:22,274
not as good as 3D kind of thing.

104
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:27,803
And the second was that I was playing a lot of Kid Icarus and Super Mario 3.

105
00:06:29,496 --> 00:06:34,880
So these are the two games I would say that inspired Owlboy more than anything else.

106
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,824
Mario had this sort of half-glide kind of thing.

107
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:43,828
It wasn't quite a flying mechanic and you couldn't quite fly along with it.

108
00:06:43,828 --> 00:06:46,570
And Kid Icarus had a...

109
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:51,514
Well, it's basically Cupid, but he couldn't fly, which felt a little limiting.

110
00:06:51,514 --> 00:06:56,478
It also had very open dungeons, but you couldn't really explore anything.

111
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:58,120
So I wanted to change that up.

112
00:06:59,584 --> 00:07:06,226
And I wanted to find a way to bring that into my own game.

113
00:07:06,226 --> 00:07:10,388
So that's one of the reasons why you fly in Owlboy,

114
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,589
is because I looked at Kid Icarus and I thought,

115
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:13,809
what if you could fly higher?

116
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:16,130
What if you could find flying islands?

117
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,571
One of the reasons Otis is mute in the game

118
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,512
is because I figured if islands are so far away,

119
00:07:21,512 --> 00:07:22,912
maybe they have their own language.

120
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:24,613
And that developed to the idea of him being mute.

121
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:27,734
It wasn't some sort of weird reference to Gordon Freeman.

122
00:07:30,573 --> 00:07:33,077
So let's see here.

123
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,199
What's the next one?

124
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:40,173
Here's also an example of things that came from Kid Icarus.

125
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:41,894
Kid Icarus was very vertical.

126
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,756
It worked more or less like Pac-Man.

127
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,858
If it could scroll, you could jump off the screen

128
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:48,819
and pop out on the other end.

129
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:50,080
But it still felt very limiting

130
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,282
because the world felt like it had some depth to it.

131
00:07:52,282 --> 00:07:54,744
These are some of the design sketches we had

132
00:07:54,744 --> 00:07:56,585
for massively open worlds,

133
00:07:56,585 --> 00:07:59,467
because back then we thought if you're making a big game,

134
00:07:59,467 --> 00:08:00,808
it has to have massive open worlds.

135
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:03,910
We have since cut these areas,

136
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,591
or at least drastically reduced them,

137
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:08,313
because we realized that there's better ways

138
00:08:08,313 --> 00:08:09,074
of designing games.

139
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:13,056
But the open world aspect of that came from iterating

140
00:08:13,056 --> 00:08:16,859
upon ideas that we didn't feel like were complete.

141
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:18,900
Okay, next point.

142
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,160
What if?

143
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,464
So, this one is another one that most people do,

144
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:27,566
but it requires a little bit of extra effort.

145
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:27,626
So,

146
00:08:29,381 --> 00:08:33,144
It's basically any idea that you have and then you add a random element to it.

147
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:36,426
How does that make the idea fun?

148
00:08:36,426 --> 00:08:42,650
Can you add something just really bizarre to something to give it that extra spice?

149
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:48,293
So just an example, how about you have a giant city filled with very dandy dinosaurs that

150
00:08:48,293 --> 00:08:48,874
talk.

151
00:08:48,874 --> 00:08:52,676
That's exactly what I did in Owlboy.

152
00:08:52,676 --> 00:08:55,017
So we had this city, Advent.

153
00:08:56,518 --> 00:08:59,859
We had a small settlement at the start of the game,

154
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:01,419
and the idea was that you were gonna come out

155
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:03,000
to the later parts of the game,

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,940
and you were gonna say,

157
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,721
now I get to explore the big city,

158
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:08,521
now I get to go into all the shops.

159
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:10,542
There was a theater in there, there was a school,

160
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,562
you could buy items, all that good stuff

161
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:16,163
that you get in your usual RPGs.

162
00:09:16,163 --> 00:09:20,184
And to spice it up a little bit, I added dinosaurs.

163
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:24,145
Keep in mind, these are 10 years old, so not so good now.

164
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:30,367
But again, when we continue working on the game,

165
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,728
we figured that on one hand,

166
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:33,349
it was a monumental undertaking

167
00:09:33,349 --> 00:09:36,812
to make a giant sprawling city to explore and all that,

168
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:40,295
but it turned out that in context of the story,

169
00:09:40,295 --> 00:09:42,897
it was much more impactful to lose that city,

170
00:09:42,897 --> 00:09:45,159
that you got a brief glimpse of it

171
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,581
and then the entire thing got destroyed.

172
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:49,942
So we ended up doing that in the game instead,

173
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:51,804
but I still kept the old designs.

174
00:09:53,937 --> 00:09:59,783
One of them was a sort of wonky looking velociraptor.

175
00:09:59,783 --> 00:10:02,045
I'm not sure why I said he was a velociraptor,

176
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:04,708
but that's kind of what I based him on.

177
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,989
Not sure you can even see that.

178
00:10:05,989 --> 00:10:06,890
I mean, he has horns.

179
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,575
But this guy stuck around for quite some time.

180
00:10:11,575 --> 00:10:16,320
And at some point, we needed a way to teach the player

181
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,041
how to do a dodge roll.

182
00:10:17,794 --> 00:10:21,476
and I kind of just dug him out of my old archives

183
00:10:21,476 --> 00:10:24,938
and looked at ways of incorporating him.

184
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:27,320
We ended up kind of liking him.

185
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,961
And because of this,

186
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,382
because he ended up having kind of a big part of the game,

187
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:34,124
they became the Bogwins,

188
00:10:34,124 --> 00:10:36,906
which are kind of a staple of Owlboy at this point.

189
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:41,689
Now, I mentioned that they were based on velociraptors,

190
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:43,630
but the team kept saying that they looked

191
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,312
sort of like a mix between a penguin and a cow.

192
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:50,807
So we gave their name by mixing bovine with penguin.

193
00:10:50,807 --> 00:10:52,568
So that's why their name Boglins, just

194
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,969
in case you're curious.

195
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:56,931
And I want to address this now.

196
00:10:56,931 --> 00:10:59,732
Back when I designed these guys, I had no idea what a

197
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:00,373
pruny was.

198
00:11:00,373 --> 00:11:04,895
So the comparison is unfortunate.

199
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:06,376
I should have picked a different color for them.

200
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:13,199
So another thing to get you guys inspired, that looks cool.

201
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:16,001
Now, this is basically just.

202
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:21,617
finding games that you like and then dissecting what you like about them.

203
00:11:21,617 --> 00:11:25,920
Either it comes from a mechanical standpoint or if it comes from just the feeling

204
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,703
that you get and I realized that saying feeling sounds like a very

205
00:11:30,703 --> 00:11:32,204
mushy kind of thing to do.

206
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:35,246
But sometimes just getting the feeling

207
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:39,129
of what you enjoy about something is a very difficult task.

208
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:39,329
So.

209
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:47,767
Just as an example from Owlboy, one of the things that inspired us a lot for doing our tutorial levels

210
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:52,311
were Mega Man X and The Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past.

211
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,714
Both these games did tutorials very well.

212
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,196
Mega Man X, for example, throws you in a pit very early,

213
00:11:58,196 --> 00:12:01,279
so that you're forced to learn the jumping mechanic to get out of the pit.

214
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:09,743
They also put enemies in certain placements, so you'll have to learn how to do certain moves in order to get around them.

215
00:12:09,743 --> 00:12:17,706
Now when it comes to Owlboy, there were a lot of people saying that the start of the game had kind of a slow tutorial,

216
00:12:17,706 --> 00:12:24,469
and that was kind of on purpose. We had a lot of focus testing and it turns out that most people just didn't understand our throw mechanic,

217
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:26,610
so we had to really hammer in how that worked.

218
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,911
But that was literally the only place that we did that.

219
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:32,352
The rest of the game, we permeated

220
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,933
with the same kind of design decisions

221
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:34,773
that we got from Mekon X.

222
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:37,994
For example, reusing, are you gonna jump?

223
00:12:37,994 --> 00:12:39,555
There you go.

224
00:12:39,555 --> 00:12:44,497
Reusing hints for certain mechanics

225
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:47,158
right before you're about to use them.

226
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:48,678
In this case, you have a stone

227
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:50,119
that looks exactly like the boss,

228
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:52,740
and the only way to destroy it is to spin on it,

229
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,600
which is exactly how you defeat the boss.

230
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,401
You have to spin on it to get the shield off.

231
00:12:57,236 --> 00:13:01,241
So, yep, I lost my notes.

232
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:02,482
There we are.

233
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,663
Okay.

234
00:13:03,663 --> 00:13:05,465
Okay, next one.

235
00:13:05,465 --> 00:13:07,167
New experiences.

236
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:09,510
Now, this one is going to be.

237
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,442
something that you're not going to feel the effects of right away.

238
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:16,984
And a lot of you are going to argue that I don't have the money or I don't have the time for this,

239
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:19,005
but I would really recommend it.

240
00:13:19,005 --> 00:13:25,069
It's basically just taking yourself to a new environment that you're not familiar with.

241
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:30,693
And simply by doing that, you're going to absorb a lot of new things that you weren't aware of previously.

242
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:35,270
During Owlboy's development, I had to break a lot of comfort zones.

243
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,732
I started dating for the first time in the US.

244
00:13:38,732 --> 00:13:41,193
I'm Norwegian, so that was a big thing.

245
00:13:41,193 --> 00:13:46,096
And I wasn't used to dealing with someone that had different interests than mine,

246
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:52,019
so I had to go along and, you know, join into fabric shops and that sort of thing.

247
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:56,021
And it turns out, when you're put in those environments, you get a lot of very neat ideas.

248
00:13:56,021 --> 00:14:00,023
I think I scribbled an entire notebook of new ideas just by going in and looking at plushies.

249
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:06,373
Here's a very simple example if I'm babbling too much.

250
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:14,358
This is Mandolin's house from the start of the game.

251
00:14:14,358 --> 00:14:16,739
For most of you it should be obvious

252
00:14:16,739 --> 00:14:20,082
that I had just visited Japan right before this,

253
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:21,042
but this wasn't intentional.

254
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:22,383
I think this was drawn maybe

255
00:14:24,395 --> 00:14:28,416
five years afterwards, but it was something I had internalized.

256
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:35,038
She has, there were no means to incorporate anything Japanese into the style,

257
00:14:35,038 --> 00:14:38,558
but because I had that, I knew certain architectural elements.

258
00:14:38,558 --> 00:14:40,579
So just because I'd been placed in that environment,

259
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:43,239
I internalized some things and I could use them for projects later.

260
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:46,260
So, next one, be bored.

261
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:54,737
I like to describe being bored as letting your mind wander and figure out what it actually

262
00:14:54,737 --> 00:14:56,558
wants to do.

263
00:14:56,558 --> 00:14:59,259
Not everyone has the luxury of doing this, of course.

264
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:01,001
Most of us are very busy.

265
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:07,665
But it is, if you read most authors' books, they will tell you that their big epiphany

266
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:12,608
was when they were on a bus or they were on a train or somewhere where they were just

267
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:15,069
mundanely staring at something without thinking.

268
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:19,752
This is really important stuff, and if you don't get a moment to yourself,

269
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,574
you're not going to be able to internalize and think about all those things

270
00:15:22,574 --> 00:15:26,957
that you've thought about previously.

271
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:27,997
Don't overdo it, though.

272
00:15:27,997 --> 00:15:28,658
That's how you become a hermit.

273
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:36,122
So, I've talked a lot of nonsense about ways to get inspired,

274
00:15:36,122 --> 00:15:39,504
so let's put that inspiration to use.

275
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:44,660
Next part is also going to seem like I'm talking down to you, but I'm really not.

276
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,381
Make stuff.

277
00:15:46,381 --> 00:15:48,322
Most of us are terrible at this.

278
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:53,726
We are not good at just starting a thing and then iterating on it.

279
00:15:53,726 --> 00:15:57,048
Usually, we start making design documents.

280
00:15:57,048 --> 00:16:01,390
We think about the mechanics before we even started looking at the program.

281
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:07,234
A lot of these things are pretty much a barrier to continuing your work.

282
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,502
I'll give you 2 examples for this just to hammer the point across.

283
00:16:13,502 --> 00:16:17,544
Before we finished completing Owlboy,

284
00:16:17,544 --> 00:16:20,586
we made another project called Savant Ascent.

285
00:16:20,586 --> 00:16:24,368
Now, a lot of people kind of felt like this project came out of nowhere

286
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:27,429
and like, where on earth did you come up with this idea?

287
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:31,811
Well, the truth is this was actually an old project.

288
00:16:31,811 --> 00:16:35,493
Joe Remy, who's sitting there filming me right now,

289
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:38,855
made a little prototype thing that looked like this.

290
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:44,020
And it was basically just sitting there,

291
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,541
flailing your arms and making something random.

292
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,262
The idea here was that enemies were coming in waves,

293
00:16:49,262 --> 00:16:50,382
in little circle patterns,

294
00:16:50,382 --> 00:16:52,643
and you can change out your gun.

295
00:16:52,643 --> 00:16:56,285
Now, later, we ended up reiterating that

296
00:16:56,285 --> 00:16:59,146
and turning that into a collaboration

297
00:16:59,146 --> 00:17:00,647
with the music artist, Salant.

298
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,073
And as you can see it's the same basic concept, but we iterated it a bit

299
00:17:06,073 --> 00:17:08,615
further. You could have new power-ups, you could jump between two points.

300
00:17:08,615 --> 00:17:14,040
It was vertically scrolling to give you that feeling of speed at the same time.

301
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,804
So a lot of that simply came from this

302
00:17:18,804 --> 00:17:21,086
doofy doodle that Joe did.

303
00:17:21,086 --> 00:17:23,768
On my end,

304
00:17:23,768 --> 00:17:26,530
I was looking through my old sketchbooks because I didn't actually

305
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,852
remember this,

306
00:17:27,852 --> 00:17:29,213
and I found this guy.

307
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:34,316
This was just some random doodle that I made maybe,

308
00:17:34,316 --> 00:17:35,917
I'm not even sure how many years ago,

309
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:36,757
was now maybe eight.

310
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:40,318
The idea was just that I have an owl

311
00:17:40,318 --> 00:17:41,438
that's based on a barn owl,

312
00:17:41,438 --> 00:17:44,318
let's just make a snowy owl, see how that turns out.

313
00:17:44,318 --> 00:17:46,379
No basic ideas about that.

314
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:48,979
And it turns out, from this,

315
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:55,081
I made one of the most important characters in Owlboy, Solas.

316
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:58,602
Which became the main focal point of

317
00:17:59,444 --> 00:18:01,025
pretty much the entire story.

318
00:18:01,025 --> 00:18:05,227
So again, this was not pre-planned.

319
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:07,448
We had no design documents doing this.

320
00:18:07,448 --> 00:18:08,388
It was just a bunch of doodles

321
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,989
that you started to interpret.

322
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:10,289
All right.

323
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:10,669
So, next up is,

324
00:18:10,669 --> 00:18:11,370
what do you actually do in this game?

325
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:11,410
So,

326
00:18:23,255 --> 00:18:29,979
A lot of you will probably ask me what is Owlboy and I'll give you the standard pitch that I give to everyone

327
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:34,722
and I'm going to have to read this adverbitum because it's going to be hard for me.

328
00:18:34,722 --> 00:18:40,286
So it's usually going to be that it's a game about flying, exploring and conquering dungeons.

329
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:44,388
That's pretty straightforward, but that's not actually what the game is about.

330
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:49,932
More accurately, let's say I describe the combat.

331
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:50,412
It is.

332
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:55,468
In combat, the game is about careful positioning in a space with preset location encounters

333
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:59,892
using twin-stick shooting mechanics while managing several switchable weapon types and

334
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:02,815
different effects while disarming abilities.

335
00:19:02,815 --> 00:19:04,836
That's what the game is actually about.

336
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:06,078
And it doesn't sound quite as pleasing.

337
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:10,839
These are the small things that you have to figure out while you're developing the game

338
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:13,740
and oftentimes it helps you to figure those out early.

339
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,841
Sometimes you're just doing development boxes.

340
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:18,081
Someone has shown you a sketch.

341
00:19:18,081 --> 00:19:19,162
Don't base it on the sketch.

342
00:19:19,162 --> 00:19:23,943
Just make some really strange, small, iterative things.

343
00:19:23,943 --> 00:19:26,143
It's the difference between thinking,

344
00:19:26,143 --> 00:19:31,465
I have a really cool game where you punch people in the face.

345
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:31,745
Like that.

346
00:19:31,745 --> 00:19:31,805
But.

347
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:37,354
If you expand that thought and instead say,

348
00:19:37,354 --> 00:19:39,676
I want jumping, standing, and ducking attacks

349
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:41,877
to count as different hit areas on the body,

350
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:43,258
that's what leads to this.

351
00:19:43,258 --> 00:19:46,981
Very different thought processes.

352
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:49,623
Let's see here.

353
00:19:51,342 --> 00:19:55,606
And these are some of my own development sketches.

354
00:19:55,606 --> 00:19:58,729
Had nothing to do with designing pretty things.

355
00:19:58,729 --> 00:20:03,853
It's just going through small, interactive little dillies

356
00:20:03,853 --> 00:20:08,157
that you're going to do while playing the game.

357
00:20:08,157 --> 00:20:08,757
These things are vital.

358
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:09,058
All right.

359
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:16,484
Another good technique, interpret the mess you've made.

360
00:20:16,484 --> 00:20:19,186
So let's say that you're.

361
00:20:19,857 --> 00:20:24,060
project is kind of a jumbled mess of sketches and

362
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:32,407
Programming language and that sort of thing, but the foundation is solid you kind of have a rough idea of what you want

363
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:37,017
One of the things you can do is just simply to interpret

364
00:20:37,017 --> 00:20:39,518
what those jarbled things are.

365
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:42,118
Not to go by your preset design documents,

366
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:43,959
just look at the image and try to figure out

367
00:20:43,959 --> 00:20:44,779
what does that look like.

368
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:47,780
I gave an example a little while ago saying,

369
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,621
if you have two boxes that you now have

370
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:52,281
moving towards each other,

371
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:53,922
try to figure out what they're thinking

372
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:54,842
as this is happening.

373
00:20:57,307 --> 00:20:59,028
I'll do a brief example.

374
00:20:59,028 --> 00:21:04,510
Here is the first sketch I did of a dungeon in Owlboy.

375
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,753
This was, I think, the second thing that I did for the game.

376
00:21:08,753 --> 00:21:13,315
Now, it looks a lot different than the finished version,

377
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:17,858
and that's because all those interpretations that I did

378
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:21,139
was based on the small symbolisms

379
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:23,200
and trying to figure out where all these things went

380
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,241
in this one image.

381
00:21:25,241 --> 00:21:25,462
Now,

382
00:21:26,402 --> 00:21:28,564
For example, I drew this symbol a lot.

383
00:21:28,564 --> 00:21:31,507
I had no idea what that was.

384
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:33,269
I drew this symbol a lot.

385
00:21:33,269 --> 00:21:35,471
No idea what that was.

386
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:35,631
And.

387
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:38,380
It turns out that that became the cornerstone

388
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,401
of what this entire project was meant to be.

389
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:43,443
If you look at one of the final images

390
00:21:43,443 --> 00:21:47,205
that you get in the game, this explains the entire story.

391
00:21:47,205 --> 00:21:50,367
These images are now a prominent part

392
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:51,328
of the design structure.

393
00:21:51,328 --> 00:21:54,470
These are now incorporated into the story,

394
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,911
they're incorporated into the way you play.

395
00:21:56,911 --> 00:21:59,733
All of this was interpreting just old sketches.

396
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:00,133
Let's see here.

397
00:22:00,133 --> 00:22:00,293
So.

398
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,936
how to get the most out of your work.

399
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:12,479
This is not really a necessary part of all this,

400
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:14,981
but I'm gonna go through it in case we have students here

401
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:17,122
that want some brief brush-ups

402
00:22:17,122 --> 00:22:18,963
on how to do basic design work.

403
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:23,586
So I'm gonna run through some ways

404
00:22:23,586 --> 00:22:26,268
on interpreting defining traits.

405
00:22:26,268 --> 00:22:26,368
So.

406
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:34,726
When I started designing the game, Otis wasn't an owl.

407
00:22:34,726 --> 00:22:36,628
He was a lot of different things.

408
00:22:36,628 --> 00:22:40,110
I just knew that I had something that was going to fly

409
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,752
and probably pick things up

410
00:22:42,752 --> 00:22:45,654
and that he was gonna land on islands.

411
00:22:45,654 --> 00:22:48,896
So I started out with this.

412
00:22:48,896 --> 00:22:52,239
It was some sort of insect guy with wings.

413
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:56,041
Most of the base mechanics were not established

414
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,302
and I think I spent about a month

415
00:22:57,302 --> 00:22:58,663
going through this entire design tree.

416
00:23:01,149 --> 00:23:03,651
At first I was going to settle on the flying dog,

417
00:23:03,651 --> 00:23:05,132
then Okami was released.

418
00:23:05,132 --> 00:23:08,694
Yes, that's how old it was, so I decided to scrap that.

419
00:23:08,694 --> 00:23:13,917
Moving further down, I went away from the dog thing

420
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:16,959
and looked more at seagulls.

421
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,400
Maybe it was like a fox that had a little cape that he

422
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,863
flew with, that sort of thing.

423
00:23:22,863 --> 00:23:26,525
And I kept iterating on concepts where

424
00:23:26,525 --> 00:23:29,006
you had some sort of cloak device and some sort

425
00:23:29,006 --> 00:23:30,307
of bird-like feature.

426
00:23:32,243 --> 00:23:35,146
This was a very long and arduous process,

427
00:23:35,146 --> 00:23:37,709
especially back then when I had no experience.

428
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:41,773
But what I finally ended up with was this guy.

429
00:23:41,773 --> 00:23:42,173
Now.

430
00:23:43,313 --> 00:23:44,374
This is not a good design.

431
00:23:44,374 --> 00:23:49,436
You can see the base elements of the final character here,

432
00:23:49,436 --> 00:23:54,778
but he has eyebrow tufts, he has some sort of

433
00:23:54,778 --> 00:23:58,040
neck thing that I haven't quite figured out what it is,

434
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,861
he has some sort of checkerboard pattern,

435
00:23:59,861 --> 00:24:02,722
he has just normal hands,

436
00:24:02,722 --> 00:24:08,464
and I don't see any loopable patterns or repeatable shapes.

437
00:24:08,464 --> 00:24:10,325
Then I scaled him down.

438
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:15,440
This is another way to quickly iterate some of your designs.

439
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,161
If you're designing your characters full size,

440
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:21,803
sometimes you end up being stuck on details.

441
00:24:21,803 --> 00:24:25,524
I decided to try and sprite him first

442
00:24:25,524 --> 00:24:27,765
because things are small and you have to point out

443
00:24:27,765 --> 00:24:29,045
the things that you want to see.

444
00:24:29,045 --> 00:24:31,667
So in this case, you can see that he's developed

445
00:24:31,667 --> 00:24:35,128
more of those weird eyebrows.

446
00:24:35,128 --> 00:24:36,088
He has his

447
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:39,148
you call those sideburns, that's the one.

448
00:24:39,148 --> 00:24:43,812
He also has more of a neck fluff thing

449
00:24:43,812 --> 00:24:47,176
and his cape now covers more of his body.

450
00:24:47,176 --> 00:24:50,219
But this still isn't the finished version.

451
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:52,842
Then I took that and I scaled it up.

452
00:24:52,842 --> 00:24:55,845
This is the final design.

453
00:24:55,845 --> 00:24:56,165
Now.

454
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:58,947
Some of the things here I should mention.

455
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:00,628
If you're looking for shape language,

456
00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:02,550
it's more satisfying when you have shapes

457
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,951
that repeat throughout the character.

458
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:06,794
If you look at the hair, the eyebrows,

459
00:25:06,794 --> 00:25:10,457
the sideburns, the tips of his cloak, and his feet,

460
00:25:10,457 --> 00:25:12,098
they all share the same points.

461
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:15,802
Also, his neck fluff thing,

462
00:25:15,802 --> 00:25:18,484
and the tips of his, the top of his boot,

463
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,566
are the same shape, more satisfying.

464
00:25:20,566 --> 00:25:24,189
Let's see here.

465
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:29,450
You can also remove traits to see if it looks weird.

466
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:32,894
If you take something away and you feel like it makes

467
00:25:32,894 --> 00:25:35,657
the character lack something, then you can put them back

468
00:25:35,657 --> 00:25:37,299
and accentuate it more.

469
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:39,962
I also want to jump back into this for a split second.

470
00:25:39,962 --> 00:25:44,026
This is more for the more hardcore fans

471
00:25:44,026 --> 00:25:45,668
because I know they'll appreciate it.

472
00:25:45,668 --> 00:25:47,190
If you look over here.

473
00:25:48,093 --> 00:25:49,995
You'll see it was kind of a weird design.

474
00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:53,177
Otis ended up being at last.

475
00:25:53,177 --> 00:25:55,559
I also realized that this is what ended up

476
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:59,341
being Twig in the game, which is one

477
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:01,843
of the starting antagonists.

478
00:26:01,843 --> 00:26:06,046
So technically, Otis and Twig are the same person.

479
00:26:06,046 --> 00:26:07,687
It's a little strange.

480
00:26:07,687 --> 00:26:12,230
Another thing I want to point out really quick,

481
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:12,991
defining colors.

482
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:21,193
It's usually more satisfying to have a color that repeats at least once within a design.

483
00:26:21,193 --> 00:26:22,795
Here's Otis.

484
00:26:22,795 --> 00:26:23,997
Here are his color blocks.

485
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:34,451
You can see that his hair, his cloak and his feet all share the same colors, as do his eyebrows and his sweater thing.

486
00:26:34,451 --> 00:26:40,693
And I purposely made his pants and his face to look the same, because it makes it stand out less.

487
00:26:40,693 --> 00:26:46,255
The main part that's popping out are his gloves, those are the unique color.

488
00:26:47,016 --> 00:26:48,998
And the reason I did that is because most of the game,

489
00:26:48,998 --> 00:26:50,861
you'll be flying around and you'll be holding things,

490
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:53,244
and you need to see those gloves when you do.

491
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:54,986
But I also made sure that when he runs,

492
00:26:54,986 --> 00:26:57,009
he has two little relics on his side

493
00:26:57,009 --> 00:26:58,411
that are colored in gray,

494
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:00,233
so that it doesn't feel too jarring when you do that.

495
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:01,175
Let's see here.

496
00:27:04,982 --> 00:27:20,268
Another thing here is consistency now all of these areas seem very different, I'm sure you have the the blue water area and you have the tropical green area and the love and all of that but in actuality all of these share the same palette.

497
00:27:20,268 --> 00:27:33,293
Now I didn't have to do that I didn't have to limit myself to using a certain amount of colors, but it adds to consistency all of this is based on the first image that I made for the game.

498
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,301
Now I'm going to be talking a little bit about sticking to your vision.

499
00:27:41,301 --> 00:27:48,043
Now, this is going to be different for everyone.

500
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:52,444
And I'm not going to claim that you'll need to...

501
00:27:52,444 --> 00:27:56,565
that you need to finish what you start.

502
00:27:56,565 --> 00:27:59,345
Most of you probably have ideas that you're really passionate about

503
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,706
that might actually not work out.

504
00:28:02,706 --> 00:28:03,827
But I know that...

505
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:09,195
actually feeling that drive is one of the biggest problems.

506
00:28:09,195 --> 00:28:12,577
Usually we sit around for months, if not years,

507
00:28:12,577 --> 00:28:16,921
developing a project, and eventually you'll lose hope

508
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:20,603
in what you're doing, or you'll hit financial trouble.

509
00:28:20,603 --> 00:28:22,905
And I feel like the biggest motivator

510
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:26,588
is feeling that passion for what you're doing,

511
00:28:26,588 --> 00:28:30,891
and finding that one thing that you really want to complete.

512
00:28:34,036 --> 00:28:37,977
There's a lot of things that you're going to get yourself into.

513
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:43,058
Sometimes a project is detrimental to your income.

514
00:28:43,058 --> 00:28:46,479
You simply can't continue.

515
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:49,539
Likely, if you work too long, your spare time will vanish.

516
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:51,420
You'll have less time to hang out with your friends.

517
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:55,461
Might actually be the case that your project is not very good.

518
00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:58,601
Might turn out that the particular market you're aiming for doesn't exist

519
00:28:58,601 --> 00:29:00,882
or is no longer interested in your project.

520
00:29:02,477 --> 00:29:05,098
Things might change halfway through development,

521
00:29:05,098 --> 00:29:07,399
and continued work is not possible.

522
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:09,100
And it might be that you need a second job

523
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,341
to keep things afloat.

524
00:29:11,341 --> 00:29:14,702
We've gone through all of this during our development.

525
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:21,125
However, I want to say that I still find it worth it.

526
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:24,626
First of all, creativity is a process.

527
00:29:24,626 --> 00:29:28,988
No one's gonna make something great on the first go.

528
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:31,677
and you're going to face multiple failures

529
00:29:31,677 --> 00:29:33,698
before you're going to achieve great things.

530
00:29:33,698 --> 00:29:37,820
The main tool I found to overcome this

531
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:42,041
is the passion and the passion from the rest of my team

532
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:46,943
to complete these hurdles.

533
00:29:46,943 --> 00:29:50,665
I taught myself how to make pixel art.

534
00:29:50,665 --> 00:29:52,446
I taught myself how to use Photoshop.

535
00:29:52,446 --> 00:29:54,526
I did not go to school for those things

536
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:57,027
and all of that was for the main reason

537
00:29:57,027 --> 00:29:59,788
of completing a project that I believed in about a lot.

538
00:30:03,018 --> 00:30:08,463
I want to finish with a little anecdote, because I feel like

539
00:30:08,463 --> 00:30:14,948
there was a moment where I realized how important this

540
00:30:14,948 --> 00:30:19,192
aspect of development was to me and the rest of the team.

541
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:23,936
So about two years ago, we were interviewed for a short

542
00:30:23,936 --> 00:30:26,859
documentary on our development.

543
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:28,681
This thing is not online, unfortunately.

544
00:30:28,681 --> 00:30:29,722
It was a school project.

545
00:30:30,836 --> 00:30:40,063
but they asked how we felt about the project at that time and I've made no secret that I've

546
00:30:40,063 --> 00:30:45,207
been struggling with depression for pretty much my entire life. And at that point I think I was

547
00:30:45,207 --> 00:30:53,113
at the lowest point where I was in my entire life. And my answer was to apologize to my team.

548
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,354
And I remember after we saw the finished cut of this,

549
00:30:58,354 --> 00:31:03,536
they had asked the question of why I apologized

550
00:31:03,536 --> 00:31:06,977
to the rest of the team, and they told me I was stupid.

551
00:31:06,977 --> 00:31:13,438
That they loved what they were doing,

552
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:19,120
and they believed in this project so much they didn't care.

553
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,501
And about, I don't even know how long later that was,

554
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:24,842
but on November 1st.

555
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:34,503
We put this thing up on Steam and hit the launch button.

556
00:31:34,503 --> 00:31:36,364
Didn't actually work out.

557
00:31:36,364 --> 00:31:38,485
We couldn't see if it was actually uploaded.

558
00:31:38,485 --> 00:31:42,086
So we had to go to the only computer in the entire office

559
00:31:42,086 --> 00:31:46,128
that didn't have the game installed and download it.

560
00:31:46,128 --> 00:31:49,390
And after about 30 minutes of waiting,

561
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:52,031
we could confirm that it was the latest version.

562
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:54,572
This was the reaction to that.

563
00:31:57,093 --> 00:32:04,960
That was nine years of built-up anguish and frustration in one moment.

564
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,302
And I know, it's not a very flattering photo.

565
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:07,442
It isn't.

566
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:17,170
But I would say, despite all of that, because people keep asking me, so I'll just do this

567
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:22,855
on stage right now, it was completely worth it.

568
00:32:22,855 --> 00:32:24,337
I would actually do it again.

569
00:32:25,222 --> 00:32:35,406
And it was the inspiration that I felt and the motivation from the rest of the team that made us get to that point.

570
00:32:35,406 --> 00:32:40,627
So, if I have to leave you with anything, listen to your own head and go do what you're going to do.

571
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:41,988
Thank you for your time.
