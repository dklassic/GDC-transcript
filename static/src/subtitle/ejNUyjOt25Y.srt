1
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:11,186
Good afternoon folks, my name is Brian Francis.

2
00:00:11,266 --> 00:00:13,127
I'm a community manager for GDC.

3
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:15,808
I'm a contributing editor at gamasutra.com,

4
00:00:15,908 --> 00:00:17,268
which is a website with a name.

5
00:00:17,909 --> 00:00:19,529
If you need to refer to me in the third person,

6
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:20,790
I use the pronouns he, him.

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,971
Today I'm delighted to be joined by Funomina CEO,

8
00:00:24,311 --> 00:00:24,972
Robin Hunneke.

9
00:00:25,432 --> 00:00:27,453
Robin, would you like to introduce yourself real quick?

10
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:30,554
Hi, I'm Robin Hunneke, I'm the CEO of Phenomena.

11
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:33,015
We're a 22 person company downtown San Francisco

12
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:35,476
until we became completely remote.

13
00:00:35,496 --> 00:00:37,737
So I'm here today to talk to people about what that means.

14
00:00:38,637 --> 00:00:42,239
I thought I'd give people a little bit of an introduction, just describe kind of where we are,

15
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:48,484
so that you know the kind of context that I'm in. I've worked with teams as large as 180. My

16
00:00:48,524 --> 00:00:54,488
current team is 22 people. That's three functional teams, so teams of about five to seven typically

17
00:00:54,508 --> 00:00:58,851
is where we start with on any game that we make inside of Phenomena.

18
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:04,515
And we were already two days a week remote when the pandemic hit.

19
00:01:04,962 --> 00:01:07,624
And we went to full remote in advance of the pandemic.

20
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:10,066
So we've been fully remote for almost four and a half months now.

21
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:14,150
I apologize for mispronouncing a number of things there.

22
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,071
Everybody does it.

23
00:01:16,312 --> 00:01:23,397
But with that in mind, I would like to quickly give a call out for folks to start asking their

24
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:29,062
questions for Robin because we are here to talk about the art and business of working from home.

25
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:32,050
But while you put your questions in chat,

26
00:01:33,891 --> 00:01:36,492
I'm going to go ahead with kind of an explainer for our mindset

27
00:01:36,612 --> 00:01:39,193
about doing this AMA.

28
00:01:40,194 --> 00:01:41,114
I'm going to level with you.

29
00:01:41,854 --> 00:01:43,955
We're here because shit is weird.

30
00:01:44,315 --> 00:01:44,816
Shit is weird.

31
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:46,436
We are not in Moscone Center.

32
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:48,417
My cat is right behind me.

33
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:51,318
And I'm using a light from my miniature painting kit

34
00:01:51,358 --> 00:01:53,199
to make sure I don't look like a goblin

35
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,200
that I would be painting.

36
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:59,995
When a once-in-a-century global pandemic hits, your job and your life get upended even if,

37
00:02:00,115 --> 00:02:03,998
like me, or Robin's team sometimes, you're already working from home.

38
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:10,263
This is true at game development studios all over the world, and as CEO of Phenomena,

39
00:02:11,063 --> 00:02:14,326
you've, Robin, been at the front line of wrangling the challenges that come with

40
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:18,809
moving studio-based teams to remote work. Like I said, we're going to take your questions.

41
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:23,859
And to help us get the right questions in,

42
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:26,741
we would like to ask you to please use the questions section

43
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:28,203
in the swap card to submit them,

44
00:02:28,643 --> 00:02:31,065
and then go ahead and upvote the questions

45
00:02:31,105 --> 00:02:32,406
that you want to see asked,

46
00:02:32,786 --> 00:02:34,688
because we will use that to help figure out

47
00:02:34,848 --> 00:02:36,149
what needs to be talked about.

48
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:41,153
I can only encourage you to please ask those questions,

49
00:02:41,273 --> 00:02:42,394
please click liberally.

50
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:45,337
Otherwise, I will start asking Robin about

51
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:53,253
Tins made using art from 1980s Mexico anti-drug propaganda.

52
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:56,095
Or I will introduce you to my cat,

53
00:02:56,135 --> 00:02:58,496
which I know people want, and I know she wants that,

54
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:00,838
but we're here to answer your questions.

55
00:03:01,238 --> 00:03:01,719
That's right.

56
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:04,641
Shout out to Victor Rosales in chat,

57
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:06,442
saying hi from Tokyo.

58
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:09,625
We can go ahead and get started with the first question

59
00:03:09,645 --> 00:03:12,587
from our good friend, Jason Della Rocca.

60
00:03:13,047 --> 00:03:13,968
All right, Jason.

61
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:15,809
Jason, thanks for running GDC Pitch.

62
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:20,908
Jason wants to know what your go-to cocktail recipe is for this.

63
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:23,489
Of course he does.

64
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,811
Perfect start. Perfect. No, this is quarantine rules.

65
00:03:28,632 --> 00:03:31,593
I actually started making my own limoncello during the quarantine

66
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:34,114
because I have a lemon tree behind my house in Santa Cruz.

67
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:39,857
And so I have a quarantini that is made out of limoncello that I made from my lemons,

68
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:44,039
which is basically vodka and lemon peels that you soak for a really long time.

69
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,186
And then I love to do it with the raw bitter cherry juice from Whole Foods,

70
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:54,132
a little bit of ice, and a splash of Campari with a slice of lime. It's actually pretty great.

71
00:03:55,632 --> 00:04:02,657
For my part, I'm just missing an old-fashioned, but if you want more mixology lessons, we do have a mixologist, I think, tonight at the...

72
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:04,379
It's the one thing I truly miss.

73
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:09,062
Yeah, you can learn how to make your own cocktails from home, too, for your home game development studios.

74
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:10,463
Okay, serious questions now.

75
00:04:10,763 --> 00:04:17,528
Michael Stephan would like to know, what are your favorite remote tools and how do you get your team to actually use them, especially if you're a less formal indie team?

76
00:04:18,164 --> 00:04:23,267
Right, so one of the things that we have found over the years with Phenomena is that you can use

77
00:04:23,647 --> 00:04:29,430
literally anything as long as it tracks data and can be edited by multiple people, right? So you

78
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,533
can do everything from just a Google spreadsheet or when we were in person, you know, a wall with

79
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:40,837
sticky notes all the way down to something really advanced like DevTrack or Asana where you're

80
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:44,178
building out a full waterfall and then trying to follow everything.

81
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:47,844
It's really actually up to the discretion of the producers on our teams.

82
00:04:48,024 --> 00:04:53,669
So some of our teams use Asana, some of them use Google Docs and spreadsheets for burndowns that

83
00:04:53,709 --> 00:05:01,256
they prefer to maintain on their own. Some people use Mondays.com and I personally use a task

84
00:05:01,276 --> 00:05:06,701
tracker myself in addition to whatever I use on the team called OmniFocus and I started using that

85
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:08,623
at the beginning of this last month.

86
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:16,863
Because I started to find that I was getting a little bit scattered in terms of just trying to check in on slack and check in on all these other things.

87
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:21,385
And I needed a place myself where I could dump everything that was coming into my brain.

88
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:27,147
I've been making games long enough now that sometimes I forget stuff, so I have to write it down.

89
00:05:27,908 --> 00:05:35,951
In terms of getting people to use it, because Phenomena was a two day a week remote studio and we had no meeting Tuesday, Thursdays.

90
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:39,976
We already had to be using this kind of software

91
00:05:40,336 --> 00:05:41,737
to coordinate action on the days

92
00:05:41,777 --> 00:05:43,879
when people are gonna be cranking and working from home.

93
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:48,242
And I think that the most comfortable way

94
00:05:48,362 --> 00:05:51,164
to introduce a piece of software,

95
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:55,848
whether it's a Slack kind of channel or a Hangout space,

96
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:57,990
is to have a central place

97
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,491
where you communicate with everyone

98
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:02,554
and then do a reminder before you're gonna be using it.

99
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:04,695
So, hey everybody, we're gonna be checking in in this space.

100
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:07,688
Hey everybody, I'm going to need you to check your Mondays today.

101
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:11,431
I'm going to be working on it in an hour before this hour is up.

102
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:13,873
Could you please check in and make sure that you've made your Monday correct?

103
00:06:14,294 --> 00:06:19,237
We also use a piece of software called 15 five now, which was suggested to me

104
00:06:19,518 --> 00:06:21,599
by my friend Chelsea, who works at iron galaxy.

105
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,281
And that's actually a really helpful tool.

106
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:28,825
You check in on your own kind of goals for the week, and then there's actually

107
00:06:28,865 --> 00:06:32,948
some questions that you can answer that the team can create a conversation around.

108
00:06:33,008 --> 00:06:33,628
Like for example.

109
00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:36,173
What are some roles that you wish we had at the company?

110
00:06:36,193 --> 00:06:38,374
Or what was the best thing that happened to you this week or whatever?

111
00:06:39,174 --> 00:06:42,696
So I think it's really about setting up a reminder and having that conversation

112
00:06:42,716 --> 00:06:45,017
ahead of time so that people get used to using it.

113
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:47,558
And then every week at the team meeting, you can remind people,

114
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,659
oh, hey, your 15.5 is due today.

115
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,700
Last week, our, you know, our submission rate was 84 percent

116
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,562
and our average was 3.5 out of five because we had kind of a bummer week

117
00:06:57,602 --> 00:06:58,482
in the news or whatever.

118
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,685
Right on, Chelsea Blasco would like to know,

119
00:07:03,045 --> 00:07:05,346
how do you establish good boundaries from working from home?

120
00:07:05,646 --> 00:07:07,768
Real quick folks, I did grab Chelsea's question,

121
00:07:07,808 --> 00:07:09,329
but I need to grab the rest of the questions

122
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:11,390
from our chat section in order to manage

123
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,891
the number of good questions you're asking.

124
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:14,172
Please make sure to ask them there.

125
00:07:14,672 --> 00:07:15,172
So yeah.

126
00:07:15,572 --> 00:07:16,593
So Chelsea's question was,

127
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:17,814
remind me again, it was boundaries?

128
00:07:18,494 --> 00:07:19,735
Yeah, how do you establish good boundaries

129
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:20,435
for working from home?

130
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,237
Right, so one of the things that we're really talking

131
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:25,719
about a lot lately is flexibility.

132
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,760
And that includes the flexibility

133
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,061
to be able to shut your camera off.

134
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:33,408
So not everybody wants to be like showing everyone the world their home.

135
00:07:33,468 --> 00:07:36,291
So some people use video backgrounds, but some people just don't feel

136
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,294
comfortable having 10 people staring at them for an hour at a time.

137
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:42,356
And if you're doing that kind of work all day, especially if you're a producer,

138
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:45,239
it can be very helpful to, for example, take your one on ones

139
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,761
from a phone where you don't have video.

140
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:51,845
And so really normalizing the idea that the video is a performance

141
00:07:51,945 --> 00:07:53,907
and that not everybody wants to perform all the time.

142
00:07:54,702 --> 00:07:58,603
The other thing that we've been really trying to do is to make people feel less compelled to attend meetings,

143
00:07:58,663 --> 00:08:02,065
but to give them the opportunity to attend if they want to.

144
00:08:02,085 --> 00:08:04,966
So create a shared space for a project,

145
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:09,048
and schedule meetings of two to three people, say, in that space,

146
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,529
and then tell the rest of the team, this is the block of meetings we're having this week.

147
00:08:12,849 --> 00:08:15,850
If you want to just hang out and listen and not be present,

148
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:18,351
you can turn on your audio, not turn on your camera,

149
00:08:18,371 --> 00:08:22,053
and you can be kind of in the room while the designers are talking about something,

150
00:08:22,113 --> 00:08:22,993
or in the room.

151
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:31,743
So it allows you to have kind of a soft boundary, which you used to have at your desk, and you no longer have now when your TV is on, or your camera.

152
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:38,792
And then the other thing is just really to make it okay to have no meeting days. We just implemented a Flex Friday program.

153
00:08:39,664 --> 00:08:43,306
At the beginning of August, based on the 15 fives that we were getting, thanks Chelsea.

154
00:08:44,206 --> 00:08:49,468
I think that one of the things that's happening is people's allostatic load is really high right now.

155
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:51,569
Would you be able to define allostatic?

156
00:08:51,609 --> 00:08:56,251
Yes, yeah actually I have a link for it which I could probably put in the chat.

157
00:08:57,452 --> 00:09:00,833
Essentially, where is the chat here?

158
00:09:01,013 --> 00:09:01,774
There it is, chat.

159
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:04,215
I'll send it to you and then you can send it out.

160
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:09,802
Managing your allostatic load is about thinking about the amount of stress you have on a day to day basis.

161
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:25,818
And one of the things that's happening in this pandemic right now is that especially people that have a lot of people at home with them, for example, people that have kids have constant interruptions and stress related to homeschooling, taking care of their families and stuff like this.

162
00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:28,884
And so the normal load that someone's processing

163
00:09:29,084 --> 00:09:31,326
in their workday is really high.

164
00:09:31,627 --> 00:09:33,388
And then on top of that, there's social stress

165
00:09:33,468 --> 00:09:35,070
and political stress and a lot of the stuff

166
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,811
that we've seen since the protests have began.

167
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:39,254
So it's like really important to understand

168
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:40,615
that everybody's kind of pegged,

169
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:43,257
which means that you need some time to relax.

170
00:09:43,337 --> 00:09:45,219
And so Flex Fridays we've implemented,

171
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:47,861
which will be on Fridays, not only are there no meetings,

172
00:09:48,182 --> 00:09:50,063
there are no one-on-ones, there are no check-ins.

173
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:52,626
And if you wanna take that day to crank,

174
00:09:53,144 --> 00:09:56,408
And catch up on something because your load was too high on a different day during the week.

175
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:57,710
That's totally fine.

176
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,654
If you want to just take a long weekend, no one's going to ask.

177
00:10:01,055 --> 00:10:05,060
So we're going to be measuring our throughput and see if everybody does what I expect,

178
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,824
which is better with a flexible Friday three-day weekend.

179
00:10:08,145 --> 00:10:10,087
And then who knows, you might even move to a four-day weekend.

180
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:10,428
We'll see.

181
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:20,131
Roger that. For the historical record, I guess we should note that we were talking about referring to the Black Lives Matter protests when Chelsea was referring to that. If we just say the protests, they won't know.

182
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:22,612
Yeah, the George Floyd murder protests.

183
00:10:22,852 --> 00:10:26,933
Yes, thank you. Thank you.

184
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:35,835
Derek Clark would like to ask, we are all having to adapt and do things differently. What have you found that has stayed the same from onsite development through the transition to remote work?

185
00:10:36,748 --> 00:10:38,889
So one of the things that we've been doing for a long time

186
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:40,149
is we've been doing it all hands.

187
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:42,629
And because we had some remote workers in Europe and stuff,

188
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,170
we actually ended up getting into the habit

189
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,710
of doing a show and tell on Fridays.

190
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,450
And that's been actually really fantastic.

191
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:51,291
Lately, we've been actually building something in Roblox.

192
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,171
And so we've been playing it on Friday afternoons

193
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:55,072
after the all hands, and that's been really great.

194
00:10:55,852 --> 00:10:57,992
There's just nothing better than playing your game together.

195
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:00,172
And so if you have a kind of game that you can play together

196
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:02,033
and be on camera and comment on it,

197
00:11:02,113 --> 00:11:04,413
it's just still so great to do a play test with the team.

198
00:11:05,113 --> 00:11:06,153
That's been fantastic.

199
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:10,769
And then the other thing is that we actually we've tried to keep the kitchen hangouts normal.

200
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:15,351
So in the morning before people would come into work, they get some coffee, talk a little bit,

201
00:11:15,411 --> 00:11:18,672
share snacks, tips, talk about movies and games they're playing, stuff like that.

202
00:11:19,032 --> 00:11:23,074
So we have a kitchen hangout space that we still use. And that's actually been very helpful as well.

203
00:11:23,794 --> 00:11:26,216
Oh, neat. Man, I think we should still, our team should still buy one.

204
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,118
A bunch of questions. We have a good news. We have a lot of questions in chat.

205
00:11:31,218 --> 00:11:34,919
Mixed news. The upvoting is a bit, there's a lot of questions and not much upvoting,

206
00:11:34,939 --> 00:11:39,081
so I'd like to encourage folks to just pick the questions you like so that we can figure out what

207
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:43,603
you need to know. Otherwise, I have to pick. And what I'm going to pick is Sean McPherson's

208
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:48,365
question, which is, hi there. I have heard that employees who are hired for a remote position can

209
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:50,065
sometimes be disregarded or blamed.

210
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:52,177
for something simply because they aren't in the office.

211
00:11:52,457 --> 00:11:53,638
Now that we're all working remotely,

212
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:55,079
how could one avoid these situations

213
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:57,181
and create a friendly and trusting relationship

214
00:11:57,201 --> 00:11:57,981
between team members?

215
00:11:58,262 --> 00:11:58,582
Thank you.

216
00:11:58,842 --> 00:11:59,903
Great question, Sean.

217
00:12:00,363 --> 00:12:01,444
Yeah, that is a great question.

218
00:12:02,245 --> 00:12:04,927
Because we're relatively small and we work in small teams,

219
00:12:05,047 --> 00:12:07,229
that kind of a situation doesn't typically happen

220
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:10,091
at Phenomena, but I have seen it happen on larger teams.

221
00:12:10,612 --> 00:12:12,593
And I guess if I was gonna run my producer brain

222
00:12:12,613 --> 00:12:15,135
through that problem, what I would say is that in general,

223
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:17,998
the best thing to do on a team is to educate everyone

224
00:12:18,358 --> 00:12:19,739
about how not to start fires.

225
00:12:20,283 --> 00:12:23,484
So if you have a problem with somebody, if someone said something in a meeting or

226
00:12:23,565 --> 00:12:27,066
they didn't deliver on a task and you're feeling frustrated, it's really,

227
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:30,308
really important to take the time out of your day to have that little difficult

228
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:33,930
conversation. It's a tiny one, but it's important to do it up front because if

229
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:36,771
you don't do it up front, then it builds and it grows and it creates more

230
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:40,933
tension. And you tend to sort of see what you're upset about. So you tend to

231
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:43,995
gather a little evidence against that other person and pretty soon you're,

232
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:47,236
you're in a beef. So I would say that the best way to make sure that that

233
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:48,557
doesn't happen is to check for it.

234
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,116
So, you know, when you're doing one-on-ones with people to sort of check in and say,

235
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:56,899
hey, have you anything come up this week that you need to discuss with anyone else?

236
00:12:57,019 --> 00:12:59,001
Any snags in your workflow?

237
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:02,363
Anything I can help you with in terms of making things go smoothly?

238
00:13:02,403 --> 00:13:05,585
So if you're producing a group like that, just make sure that you're encouraging

239
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,406
those conversations and those one-on-ones.

240
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:11,910
It's really hard to encourage one-on-ones right now because people really are meeting out.

241
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:17,293
So the other thing to do is to keep your meeting load low so that casual conversations can occur.

242
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:19,892
And people can chat with one another when they need to.

243
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:25,514
Tony Evans would like to know, what are your strategies for preventing remote team members

244
00:13:25,594 --> 00:13:26,234
from burning out?

245
00:13:26,835 --> 00:13:29,976
So this is actually something that we've been thinking about a lot and one of the reasons

246
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:31,497
that we're doing the Flex Fridays.

247
00:13:32,197 --> 00:13:37,199
I'm especially concerned with the election coming up and fall coming into play, kids

248
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:38,340
having to go back to school.

249
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,141
We have a lot of parents at Phenomena who are really, really on the fence about what

250
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:43,142
to do moving forward.

251
00:13:43,849 --> 00:13:48,433
Even in different parts of the Bay Area, there's different messaging depending on what age your child is and stuff.

252
00:13:48,853 --> 00:13:52,997
So the reason that we started the Flex Fridays is really to encourage people to take that extra day.

253
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:58,942
We generally schedule for four hours of concrete, deliverable work a day,

254
00:13:59,402 --> 00:14:03,425
because you have at least two hours of meetings, plus you have to have lunch, and then you still have your commute.

255
00:14:03,846 --> 00:14:08,350
But that commute time, that lunch time, are getting eaten up by many people's children and families.

256
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,681
And so still like four hour work week,

257
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:12,682
keeping a four hour work week really,

258
00:14:12,882 --> 00:14:15,903
or work day really solid would still be hard for some people.

259
00:14:16,304 --> 00:14:18,885
So also being flexible about how much work

260
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:20,066
you're scheduling someone for,

261
00:14:20,386 --> 00:14:23,087
that really requires a focused head.

262
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:26,509
Engineers in particular can sometimes double down

263
00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:29,831
on engineering tasks because it feels like control.

264
00:14:30,171 --> 00:14:32,192
And so monitoring your engineers and making sure

265
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:33,753
that they're checking in with their families

266
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,614
and not just burying their heads in their computers

267
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:36,634
is also really important.

268
00:14:39,305 --> 00:14:41,287
Camille Mawinski would like to ask,

269
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:44,569
how do you handle communication with part-time team members?

270
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:47,551
Some of them might be working very irregular hours.

271
00:14:48,572 --> 00:14:50,053
So this is actually a really good question

272
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:52,075
for people that also have international teams.

273
00:14:52,795 --> 00:14:55,858
Actually being able to respect people's time on and time off

274
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:57,739
of something like a Slack or email,

275
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:00,881
having a lot more conversations in organized fashion

276
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:03,323
and not trying to ping people all the time is really good.

277
00:15:04,024 --> 00:15:06,606
And scheduling a regular check-in at least every week

278
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:07,766
is also very helpful.

279
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,841
So worst case scenario, if you start the week with a check-in,

280
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:13,062
you'll be able to remember something that came up last week

281
00:15:13,082 --> 00:15:17,424
that you didn't get a chance to talk about because times didn't coordinate.

282
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:21,646
I think one of the hardest things to do is to be working with a team remotely

283
00:15:22,327 --> 00:15:24,948
or a collaborator remotely who's in a very different time zone.

284
00:15:25,748 --> 00:15:29,170
And the standard practices are always about making sure that you understand

285
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,471
what their on hours are and what their off hours are,

286
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:35,613
and making it a priority to be sensitive to those requests based on their calendaring.

287
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:40,129
Next question comes from Yusung Chung.

288
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,411
Hey Robin, we worked together a long time ago at EA.

289
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:44,351
She's still there.

290
00:15:44,471 --> 00:15:46,572
Yeah, this is you.

291
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:48,314
I have a couple of questions.

292
00:15:49,134 --> 00:15:53,877
One, how do you measure velocity and productivity hit creative work at home?

293
00:15:54,317 --> 00:15:57,839
Two, it's getting very hard to keep people socializing with each other.

294
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,101
There are just a lot of things that naturally come up when people are in a casual setting.

295
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:03,342
Accidental creativity is one, for example.

296
00:16:03,675 --> 00:16:06,977
Do you have anything special to encourage non-agenda driven conversations

297
00:16:07,037 --> 00:16:08,118
among the people you work with?

298
00:16:08,878 --> 00:16:13,941
Yeah, so actually we have a policy that actually comes from the Google study

299
00:16:13,981 --> 00:16:17,644
about the Aerosol project, about how to have the world's best meetings and best

300
00:16:17,704 --> 00:16:21,126
teams. I read that stuff pretty actively.

301
00:16:21,526 --> 00:16:25,368
And the other thing that we do is we have we've built the company philosophy

302
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:28,790
around the idea of a deliberately developmental organization.

303
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,932
So I can actually send you the original article.

304
00:16:31,972 --> 00:16:33,053
We can put that out in the chat.

305
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:38,657
That I read about this particular sort of idea. It's from the Harvard Business Review.

306
00:16:38,677 --> 00:16:43,838
And the idea is that you want people to be able to bring their full selves to work.

307
00:16:44,018 --> 00:16:48,599
As you know, especially when you work in a larger organization, you can feel like you kind of have two versions of you.

308
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:55,060
There's the version of you that you bring to the office that's like doing everything perfectly and just OK or just fine.

309
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,101
And then there's the part of you like you get in your car and you're like, oh, you know,

310
00:16:58,141 --> 00:17:03,282
like I'm going through a breakup or my kids are really struggling at school or my mom has cancer or whatever it is.

311
00:17:03,802 --> 00:17:12,846
And so when we founded Phenomena, we wanted to use the deliberately developmental organizational strategies to create a safe space for people to really truly be themselves.

312
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:22,090
There's actually a book about it, which I'll also share with you. It's called An Everyone Place, or An Everyone Culture, sorry, Becoming a Deliberately Development Place.

313
00:17:22,412 --> 00:17:49,227
Developmental organization. And the idea is that what you want to do is start your meetings with real talk about what's going on in your lives and not be embarrassed if you're having a bad day to say like, Hey, everybody, I'm really struggling. So, for example, a few weeks ago, my brother actually came down with COVID. And I had a meeting that I had to attend. And I started the meeting by saying, Listen, I'm sorry, I'm gonna turn my camera off because I'm not in a really great place. My brother's not well, I'm really worried about my brother and my family.

314
00:17:49,646 --> 00:17:50,967
So I'm going to be quiet in this meeting.

315
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:52,748
If you really need something from me, I'll be here,

316
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:54,669
but I'm just going to be taking some time to myself.

317
00:17:55,129 --> 00:17:56,530
Being able to say that kind of stuff

318
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,611
really does help people feel comfortable sharing

319
00:17:59,691 --> 00:18:03,634
and socializing outside of the sort of work scenario.

320
00:18:04,054 --> 00:18:05,855
And if you do it a little bit every time

321
00:18:05,895 --> 00:18:07,656
you meet at the beginning and at the end,

322
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:09,497
then eventually it becomes part of the culture.

323
00:18:10,317 --> 00:18:12,098
I think the other thing is to really understand

324
00:18:12,138 --> 00:18:15,000
that sometimes people just don't really feel social,

325
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,661
and that's OK.

326
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:18,362
Right now, it's very hard.

327
00:18:18,442 --> 00:18:19,362
We actually started.

328
00:18:19,846 --> 00:18:37,452
The pandemic with a like a costume theme for our Friday all hands or people would wear hats and it was really fun for a while and then it got to the point where it's just kind of felt like we were trying too hard to be OK with what is really actually turning into being like a very difficult and mismanaged situation on the federal level.

329
00:18:38,472 --> 00:18:43,234
And so we stopped pretending we don't dress up for meetings anymore and occasionally we may.

330
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:46,979
But I think the idea is to not force it and to try and be really honest.

331
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:49,560
It does mean that the producers are going to do more emotional labor.

332
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,101
There is going to be more chit chat about difficult stuff,

333
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:57,243
which means your producers need more free time to kind of offload that stuff.

334
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,944
But they should be used to doing that work on their own anyway,

335
00:18:59,984 --> 00:19:00,924
because that's the job.

336
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:06,526
Wow, I'm so sorry to hear that your brother is better, actually.

337
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,087
He got better. Yeah. And no one else is infected.

338
00:19:09,127 --> 00:19:10,708
So it was a miracle. Yeah.

339
00:19:10,748 --> 00:19:11,448
My nephew. Yeah.

340
00:19:12,472 --> 00:19:15,173
Okay, I was like, this is maybe very sad.

341
00:19:15,193 --> 00:19:16,273
Yeah.

342
00:19:16,413 --> 00:19:18,174
Camille, you're welcome.

343
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:20,435
I really try to do my best from pronouncing folks' names,

344
00:19:20,455 --> 00:19:22,515
which is why I felt bad about messing up Robin's earlier.

345
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:23,936
More questions.

346
00:19:24,116 --> 00:19:25,957
Megan Brin has a great one.

347
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:29,318
How do you create an environment where younger or newer folks

348
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,839
feel more comfortable speaking up or pointing out issues,

349
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:34,260
especially now that you just can't chat in person?

350
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:40,391
Yeah, so we're actually in the process of doing a real deep dive on this issue.

351
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:44,473
The way that we founded Phenomena, the reason that Martin and I decided to use

352
00:19:44,513 --> 00:19:47,455
the deliberately developmental framework was because we wanted to hire young

353
00:19:47,495 --> 00:19:50,978
people with less experience and then develop them towards what's called their

354
00:19:51,198 --> 00:19:54,660
edge. So the idea is that you're really confident about the things that you're

355
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,322
good at, but you're also confident about the things that you're not good at.

356
00:19:57,662 --> 00:20:00,544
And you say, like, I'm not so good at listening or I'm not so good at

357
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:04,047
turn-taking or I'm not so good at following up on requests, whatever it is

358
00:20:04,347 --> 00:20:05,448
that you need to be working on.

359
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:09,869
And then you work with your producer and the people around you to make sure that you're making your edge better.

360
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:19,153
So, one of the best things that you can do to make young people feel safe and heard is to make everybody, obviously, in the process of learning.

361
00:20:19,273 --> 00:20:26,836
There's no such thing as a person in a developmental organization who doesn't have an edge or who isn't learning or isn't improving because we all are always learning.

362
00:20:26,956 --> 00:20:33,899
So, I think that it's getting rid of the auteur culture or this idea that there's people that know how to do it and people that don't.

363
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:38,387
I mean, especially now in this pandemic, nobody knows what's happening.

364
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,509
And nobody knows how to do it right.

365
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:42,189
This is like, we're all learning together.

366
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:43,910
So really embracing that is important.

367
00:20:44,471 --> 00:20:49,673
Um, I also think that, um, there are ways to set up conversations where people can

368
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:52,895
feel safer talking to say a consultant.

369
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:56,197
So for example, we have a community action program that we're putting together

370
00:20:56,217 --> 00:21:00,679
where we've set aside $10,000 to donate to local actions around black lives

371
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,540
matter and the George Floyd disaster.

372
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:08,220
And thinking about how to make policing and life more safe here for Black people in the Bay Area.

373
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:14,243
However, in order to adjudicate that conversation, we probably need to bring in someone who's an expert and none of us are.

374
00:21:14,603 --> 00:21:21,226
And so having the conversation with people about who could we bring in to educate ourselves, we had a fantastic person come in

375
00:21:22,326 --> 00:21:28,669
just about six months before the pandemic to educate the whole team about trans language, using people's

376
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:57,815
Correct pronouns, how to recognize those pronouns and how to engage with a trans person in your community, because we wanted our employees to feel safe and inclusive at the same time we wanted them to get some education because some of them hadn't necessarily grown up around trans people and needed some help. And so I think it's often about bringing in experts and having conversations as a group, so that everyone at all levels of the organization and all all sort of philosophies and walks of life can develop a sense of affinity around a shared goal which is

377
00:21:58,262 --> 00:21:59,983
For us, it's making an inclusive org.

378
00:22:00,603 --> 00:22:02,204
We have eight minutes left in the conversation.

379
00:22:02,224 --> 00:22:06,246
I would like to invite everyone who's watching to submit some more questions.

380
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:12,429
Please be sure to use the questions section when you do so, so that folks can upvote the questions.

381
00:22:12,469 --> 00:22:14,370
Although, you know, we're going down the queue here.

382
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,311
Just because a question is getting less votes doesn't mean it's not going to get asked.

383
00:22:17,722 --> 00:22:19,924
For instance, oh God, that sounds like a weird call out.

384
00:22:20,144 --> 00:22:22,186
Anyway, Matt Warner would like to know,

385
00:22:22,866 --> 00:22:24,248
what's the best way to get in contact

386
00:22:24,268 --> 00:22:25,889
with developers and decision makers?

387
00:22:26,249 --> 00:22:28,691
They're finding it hard to do through PAX East and GDC,

388
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,693
which is just kind of like speaks to how,

389
00:22:30,713 --> 00:22:32,855
yeah, and hey, yeah, we work for GDC.

390
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:34,416
We got disrupted real hard this year.

391
00:22:35,617 --> 00:22:37,579
Even if we're trying to stay on topic

392
00:22:37,719 --> 00:22:39,640
about working in your company,

393
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,262
a lot of work got done at these spaces and these events.

394
00:22:42,322 --> 00:22:45,225
How do you view as a team grappled with these events

395
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:46,346
changing their venues?

396
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:49,125
So obviously, you know, I really miss being at events.

397
00:22:49,165 --> 00:22:51,869
I miss seeing friends like Chelsea and having a beer and talking about

398
00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:53,291
what's been going on in the industry.

399
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:54,954
But I think what we've been doing

400
00:22:55,715 --> 00:22:59,260
to create connections with other developers and to stay in touch with our friends.

401
00:22:59,724 --> 00:23:22,603
Is doing a lot of remote zooms, you know, drink ups and meetups, and actually movie nights is another one that's really great or gaming with each other. If you're trying to break in, it's actually it is really critical that you figure out a way to create a conversation with developers, and it is really hard. I've actually been talking a little bit with Megan Scavio. She and I helped run an event called Amplifying

402
00:23:23,463 --> 00:23:39,177
I'm thinking a little bit about some kind of event that we could start or run that would effectively act in the same fashion as the GDC conference associate kind of experience, but it's very, very difficult.

403
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:44,422
And actually, I think that this is a question for the organizations that run events like PAX and GDC.

404
00:23:45,163 --> 00:23:50,327
As the PAX dev ambassador, I'll bring it to the PAX staff because I know that PAX will be online this year.

405
00:23:50,731 --> 00:23:54,374
Maybe there'll be some ways that we can do some AMAs with developers for fans.

406
00:23:55,715 --> 00:23:59,697
I'm going to tweak Victor Rizal's question here.

407
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:04,641
Their team uses Slack and Zoom and they're feeling a loss of communication.

408
00:24:06,382 --> 00:24:11,005
What are other companies doing to improve the lack of face-to-face communication,

409
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:16,990
even while balancing what you said a couple minutes ago about the option to go camera-less during meetings?

410
00:24:17,616 --> 00:24:22,820
So one thing you can do is try to do more social events that are opt-in, that are at

411
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,423
times that people that have kids can participate and that don't require alcohol.

412
00:24:27,463 --> 00:24:32,027
So there's just a lot of stuff that you have to work around given the way things are working

413
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:33,848
right now.

414
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:40,333
The other thing is to just do a phone call, just a one-on-one phone call with another

415
00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:41,874
member of the team and check in.

416
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,357
If you have been social distancing and are safe.

417
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:52,043
And don't have any symptoms, you can also, if you can, travel to see another teammate.

418
00:24:52,143 --> 00:24:57,484
So, I have a couple of teammates that I'm in a pod with that I travel to see on a regular basis.

419
00:24:58,304 --> 00:25:05,166
And that's just basically to show up, see them, be with them in a park or a public space.

420
00:25:05,466 --> 00:25:08,027
Maybe we both bring a beer, we have a beer, we talk.

421
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:11,221
But try to get a little bit of face time with people.

422
00:25:11,281 --> 00:25:13,282
If you do happen to be developing in the same city,

423
00:25:13,782 --> 00:25:14,843
you'd be surprised.

424
00:25:14,883 --> 00:25:17,385
Like it can look really fine on the camera.

425
00:25:17,846 --> 00:25:20,027
And then actually when the person shuts off the camera,

426
00:25:20,047 --> 00:25:22,009
they can feel incredibly isolated and alone.

427
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:24,351
And some people really need face time

428
00:25:24,891 --> 00:25:27,073
and seeing other people physically

429
00:25:27,153 --> 00:25:28,113
in order to feel connected.

430
00:25:28,454 --> 00:25:31,996
I'm not that way, but I know people who are,

431
00:25:32,117 --> 00:25:33,678
and it's actually a very difficult time.

432
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:36,900
So I think actually, if you can safely check in.

433
00:25:37,384 --> 00:25:39,466
And do a distance hangout or a picnic sometimes.

434
00:25:39,506 --> 00:25:42,989
That's also even just with one other person on your team, that can be very helpful.

435
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:45,471
And then my favorite thing is to send chocolate or flowers.

436
00:25:45,551 --> 00:25:48,674
Someone from my team sent me chocolate yesterday and I was so happy.

437
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:52,317
With about four minutes, 20, nice, left on the clock.

438
00:25:52,658 --> 00:25:56,001
We're going to try and get as many questions as we can.

439
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:58,343
So, Robin, we may need to shorten the answers.

440
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:03,668
DT, Bandla Moody would like to know,

441
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:05,930
could game development move to a remote model

442
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:08,411
even after the pandemic ends, completely remote?

443
00:26:08,831 --> 00:26:10,872
Absolutely, although I really do miss the office.

444
00:26:10,952 --> 00:26:13,393
We've actually decided to de-res

445
00:26:13,553 --> 00:26:15,394
and actually wait until the pandemic is over

446
00:26:15,454 --> 00:26:17,595
to figure out what in-person work would look like

447
00:26:17,695 --> 00:26:19,016
if we decided to do it again.

448
00:26:19,436 --> 00:26:21,317
The other thing is that with the constraints

449
00:26:21,337 --> 00:26:22,818
that we're seeing, traveling

450
00:26:22,938 --> 00:26:24,498
and not driving your car all the time,

451
00:26:25,997 --> 00:26:29,537
Being something that's sort of restricted is actually really good for the environment.

452
00:26:29,917 --> 00:26:36,299
So I'm actually not so positive on the idea of us all having to start flying all over the world again in order to do our business.

453
00:26:37,379 --> 00:26:39,599
It's kind of a, it's a toss up for me.

454
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:46,961
Yeah. Sean McPherson asks, you mentioned including keeping the office kitchen around because of the social importance of it.

455
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:52,502
Are there other activities that are great and effective this time for team building, building morale and lifting spirits?

456
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:54,968
Yeah, so you can have Office Olympics.

457
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:58,131
That's something that our office coordinator, Jamie, put together.

458
00:26:58,831 --> 00:27:02,455
She'll just organize different types of tests and games that we can play

459
00:27:02,475 --> 00:27:03,055
against each other.

460
00:27:03,095 --> 00:27:06,098
The last one, I believe, was a typing test to see who could type the fastest,

461
00:27:06,178 --> 00:27:06,878
most accurately.

462
00:27:07,639 --> 00:27:11,182
And a lot of these are just run in the Slack channel that are in at the company.

463
00:27:11,482 --> 00:27:13,784
The other thing that I saw recently was someone had a ship party

464
00:27:13,844 --> 00:27:17,808
and they actually shipped meals and tequila mix and all this crazy stuff

465
00:27:17,828 --> 00:27:19,869
to their people so that they could have a big party together.

466
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:20,890
Double Fine also did.

467
00:27:21,277 --> 00:27:25,700
A really great personalized tequila bottle for their 20th anniversary, which is fantastic.

468
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,362
So sending people things in their homes and then getting on camera together is actually

469
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:29,803
kind of fun.

470
00:27:30,123 --> 00:27:33,305
I even attended a magic show like that with a pitchfork, so that was pretty great.

471
00:27:34,065 --> 00:27:37,528
Maggie LaRouche would like to know, working remote seems to have increased the amount

472
00:27:37,568 --> 00:27:38,608
of meetings across the board.

473
00:27:38,628 --> 00:27:42,751
What are the best practices that were introduced to reduce them so your team can focus and

474
00:27:42,791 --> 00:27:44,372
deliver on their 20-hour-a-week goals?

475
00:27:44,945 --> 00:27:48,227
Yeah, so actually the no meeting days are really, really essential.

476
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,488
Having very short meetings is also essential.

477
00:27:50,528 --> 00:27:53,050
Having an agenda ahead of the meeting, obviously really helpful.

478
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:57,292
If you want to have time in a meeting to brainstorm, timeboxing that time.

479
00:27:57,692 --> 00:28:00,954
And then Google actually has a short meetings option in its menu.

480
00:28:00,974 --> 00:28:04,756
If you're using Google Calendar, you can click the short meetings and it'll end your meetings

481
00:28:04,836 --> 00:28:08,578
five or ten minutes earlier so that you don't end up in a back-to-back meeting

482
00:28:08,618 --> 00:28:11,939
cycle with no bathroom breaks, which is a really, really bad place to be.

483
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,520
Oh shoot, that's how I got on this call.

484
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,771
Okay, a couple minutes left.

485
00:28:16,791 --> 00:28:19,152
We're going to ask a couple more questions before we do.

486
00:28:19,612 --> 00:28:22,134
When you're done here, please click on the session evaluation.

487
00:28:22,174 --> 00:28:23,754
It's going to pop up either in this session.

488
00:28:23,774 --> 00:28:25,055
You can click on it again to see it or

489
00:28:25,075 --> 00:28:26,396
it'll come up through your notifications.

490
00:28:27,036 --> 00:28:28,697
If you give feedback on this session,

491
00:28:28,717 --> 00:28:29,658
whether it's good or bad,

492
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:31,759
we'll be able to improve these sessions in the future.

493
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,360
We never did it in AMAs before.

494
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,320
This is new. We like it.

495
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,121
We did a couple, but now we're doing a lot.

496
00:28:37,242 --> 00:28:38,442
This question, I'm going to try and get

497
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:40,023
at least one other question besides this one in,

498
00:28:40,103 --> 00:28:42,665
but Anisha Deshmani would like to know,

499
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:47,506
I would love any ideas on onboarding teammates who are new to a project or company.

500
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:51,087
It's so much harder to do when there aren't people around to absorb information from.

501
00:28:51,788 --> 00:28:55,169
Yeah, so we have a wiki that we've been building out. Jamie's been helping with that as well.

502
00:28:55,389 --> 00:29:00,970
And I think that building an internal wiki that shows what it's like to be part of the team and

503
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:04,631
then keeping that conversation really going is important because it gives someone something to

504
00:29:04,671 --> 00:29:09,132
latch on to. Having someone that they can follow through a day, so be on a bunch of different calls

505
00:29:09,152 --> 00:29:12,613
with the producer as they manage different parts of the project is also helpful.

506
00:29:13,465 --> 00:29:19,589
And then finally inviting them to present or give conversation in a more relaxed forum.

507
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:21,790
So we have tech talks that we do.

508
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,391
People volunteer to do tech talks.

509
00:29:23,731 --> 00:29:26,292
We also have culture talks that sometimes happen over lunch hour.

510
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:29,474
People talk about the food from their cultures where they grew up and stuff.

511
00:29:29,855 --> 00:29:33,117
So just creating events where they can contribute something personal is very helpful.

512
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:39,022
In the long run, my favorite thing to make people feel involved is what we call the thumbs-up award.

513
00:29:39,042 --> 00:29:40,543
We give it away every Friday.

514
00:29:40,903 --> 00:29:44,784
If you get the thumbs-up, your job the next week is to give it to someone who did something that made you feel great.

515
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:48,446
It can be anything. It doesn't have to be specifically to the development.

516
00:29:48,766 --> 00:29:53,807
But as the thumbs-up goes around, it actually helps you see who is doing nice things for other people,

517
00:29:53,847 --> 00:29:56,148
and that helps people feel encouraged to do nice things,

518
00:29:56,488 --> 00:30:00,450
and it gets people involved in the cycle of being a friend at the office, which is important.

519
00:30:01,005 --> 00:30:04,588
We are running a slightly bit out of time, but I'm going to get one more question.

520
00:30:04,648 --> 00:30:08,631
Robin, real quick, if they have more questions from you, where should they ask them?

521
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:10,172
Go ahead and ask me on Twitter.

522
00:30:10,212 --> 00:30:13,835
I'll go ahead and answer your DMs or your tweets as much as I can.

523
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:14,655
I'll start a thread now.

524
00:30:15,356 --> 00:30:16,897
And what's your Twitter handle again?

525
00:30:17,237 --> 00:30:20,799
It's just my last name, at H-U-N-I-C-K-E, Hunnecke.

526
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,360
At Hunnecke.

527
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:26,023
OK, I have a question that I've been thinking about actually since the Ukrainian protests

528
00:30:26,143 --> 00:30:29,225
that led to the ouster of the president over there in like 2015 or so.

529
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:35,253
What are your thoughts about what happens when a team member is suddenly in an area

530
00:30:35,953 --> 00:30:40,236
that's seeing something like the George Floyd protests or the uprising, and they either want to participate,

531
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:43,858
they're struggling, whether the struggle to go out over COVID.

532
00:30:44,598 --> 00:30:49,661
Like, if a person is in a physical part of the world that is suddenly in a kind of upheaval,

533
00:30:50,482 --> 00:30:54,004
whether it affects them, whether they want to participate and be a good citizen,

534
00:30:54,284 --> 00:30:57,286
what are your thoughts about accommodating that, even though they're trying to, like, you know,

535
00:30:57,765 --> 00:31:01,868
Work, earn money from you, for instance. Oh, absolutely. Like everyone at Phenomena,

536
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:06,771
the minute that the protests became apparently necessary and we needed to actually start

537
00:31:07,311 --> 00:31:13,414
really, really pushing on this issue here in the Bay Area, everybody at the office on at the Friday

538
00:31:13,595 --> 00:31:16,396
meetup, I just sort of said, hey, listen, if you're going to be participating in protests,

539
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:20,499
just stay safe. Please let us know where you are. If you need a buddy, if you have any questions,

540
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:24,361
people are going to be posting in the channel. We created a channel specifically related.

541
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:28,602
To black lives matter and some of the protests that were happening in Oakland in particular.

542
00:31:28,983 --> 00:31:33,004
Martin, my co founder lives just next to City Hall and I live just next to City Hall in San Francisco.

543
00:31:33,064 --> 00:31:35,665
So, you know, I mean, I think it does affect you.

544
00:31:35,725 --> 00:31:40,607
And the idea with being able to be honest about who you are at work is that this never comes up as a surprise.

545
00:31:40,647 --> 00:31:42,848
A phenomena when bad shit happens, we could talk about it.

546
00:31:43,288 --> 00:31:47,009
And it's very important for everyone to recognize that bad shit is going to be happening for a while.

547
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:51,051
So we need to be OK with being less productive and more caring towards one another.

548
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,052
If we don't do that, we'll never get through anything.

549
00:31:53,132 --> 00:31:54,032
So it's essential.

550
00:31:54,568 --> 00:31:57,950
That's the right message to end this AMA session on, I think.

551
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,711
Robin, thank you so much for joining us.

552
00:31:59,811 --> 00:32:02,373
Everyone in chat, thank you so much for asking questions.

553
00:32:02,913 --> 00:32:05,415
Stick around, we have more AMAs going on tomorrow.

554
00:32:05,735 --> 00:32:07,396
We have more great sessions tonight.

555
00:32:08,537 --> 00:32:11,839
And I hope you all have a safe and lovely Wednesday.

556
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:12,900
It's Wednesday, right?

557
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,561
I don't remember the time anymore.

558
00:32:15,762 --> 00:32:16,302
Bye, everyone.
