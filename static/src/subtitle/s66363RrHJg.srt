1
00:00:06,596 --> 00:00:06,816
All right.

2
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:07,476
Hello.

3
00:00:07,496 --> 00:00:08,416
Hi.

4
00:00:09,317 --> 00:00:10,237
My name is Mullen Leo.

5
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:15,439
I work for ILMxLAB as director of content and platform strategy.

6
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:21,660
First of all, I'm supposed to make a couple of requests that electronic devices are turned

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,382
off or to silent, and that at the end of the talk you fill out the survey.

8
00:00:27,242 --> 00:00:27,742
If you like it.

9
00:00:27,802 --> 00:00:28,662
If you don't like it, then don't.

10
00:00:32,743 --> 00:00:39,145
So we're excited to be part of the new GDC vision track, which

11
00:00:39,725 --> 00:00:41,306
kind of invites contributors to sort of gaze

12
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:44,906
into the crystal ball and make predictions about the future.

13
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:47,407
And then those will be put in the GDC vault.

14
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:50,088
And then years from now, people can look at it and laugh at how

15
00:00:50,108 --> 00:00:51,568
we were wrong about everything.

16
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:56,908
So making predictions is particularly hard, I think,

17
00:00:56,948 --> 00:01:00,511
about things like VR and AR and mixed reality,

18
00:01:00,952 --> 00:01:03,354
because there's still so much in their infancy

19
00:01:03,454 --> 00:01:06,737
that it's really hard to speculate on how they will

20
00:01:06,757 --> 00:01:09,139
affect our lives in the future.

21
00:01:11,265 --> 00:01:14,268
Astronomer and author Clifford Stoll famously wrote,

22
00:01:15,289 --> 00:01:18,511
Discount the fawning techno-verbal about virtual communities.

23
00:01:18,972 --> 00:01:21,494
Computers and networks isolate us from one another.

24
00:01:22,254 --> 00:01:25,056
This non-place lures us to surrender our time on Earth.

25
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:28,119
A poor substitute it is, this virtual reality.

26
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,243
He wrote that in 1995 in a now notorious Newsweek article

27
00:01:33,543 --> 00:01:35,965
on why the Internet will never take off.

28
00:01:37,873 --> 00:01:41,756
It actually took courage for him to put something like that in writing,

29
00:01:42,597 --> 00:01:44,198
and he's been mocked for it ever since.

30
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:46,780
So I'm counting on two things today,

31
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,243
that it'll take at least a few years for you to figure out that I'm wrong about everything.

32
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:55,327
And secondly, I didn't put anything in writing, I just put a bunch of pictures on here.

33
00:01:57,894 --> 00:02:05,542
So speaking of the Internet, early visions of shared VR communities and worlds like the

34
00:02:05,763 --> 00:02:11,969
1992 novel Snow Crash, which introduced the term metaverse, were certainly influenced

35
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:14,492
by impressions of the Internet at the time.

36
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:20,308
And oddly, in spite of the vast technological advances

37
00:02:20,388 --> 00:02:22,792
and social changes over the last 25 years,

38
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:27,200
the pop culture predictions for what VR will be in the future

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,342
haven't really changed much.

40
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:34,919
So from the metaverse in Snow Crash to, you know, the oasis in the upcoming Ready Player

41
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:41,267
One film, there's really a common theme here of the future of VR, sort of as a walled-off

42
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:46,914
substitute world that we escape into while outside the real world sort of descends into

43
00:02:46,954 --> 00:02:47,955
a dystopian nightmare.

44
00:02:50,243 --> 00:02:53,044
Maybe one reason why this prediction hasn't really changed much

45
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:56,226
is because we tend to consider VR in isolation.

46
00:02:57,146 --> 00:03:00,528
But when you look at truly transformative shifts in technology and culture,

47
00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,410
they often don't stem from a single technological advancement,

48
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:08,211
but from the clash of multiple, at first seemingly unrelated,

49
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,653
breakthroughs that then combine into a catalyst for change.

50
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:16,095
So, for example, it's easy to think that our current world

51
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:18,016
is a product of the Internet age.

52
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,332
But that's too simplistic.

53
00:03:21,194 --> 00:03:23,037
The internet certainly played a big part in it,

54
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:25,440
but our popular culture was built

55
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,004
on the confluence of many different technical

56
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:28,565
developments.

57
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,213
Take something as simple as a video chat filter.

58
00:03:34,232 --> 00:03:36,694
The technology required to make something like this possible

59
00:03:36,754 --> 00:03:38,175
is much more than just the internet.

60
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:42,237
There's portable computing, high speed wireless connectivity,

61
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:45,359
miniaturized cameras, multi-touch screens,

62
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,141
real-time rendering, face recognition, feature tracking,

63
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,121
and many more.

64
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:54,585
So to look at VR in isolation when making future predictions

65
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:56,106
is too reductive as well.

66
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:01,569
At ILMxLAB, virtual reality experiences

67
00:04:01,749 --> 00:04:03,289
are a big part of what we create.

68
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,271
But we chose to call our mission something broader,

69
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:08,732
immersive entertainment, because we

70
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:11,914
believe that storytelling and world building that places you

71
00:04:11,974 --> 00:04:14,775
at the center, that lets you step inside the story

72
00:04:14,935 --> 00:04:17,056
and become part of the world, will

73
00:04:17,096 --> 00:04:18,857
develop into many different experiences

74
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:23,059
in different places, virtual, real, and everywhere

75
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:23,439
in between.

76
00:04:26,325 --> 00:04:29,610
Two core concepts of the original metaverse idea

77
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,394
are a persistent social world and persistent avatars.

78
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:37,920
So in most fiction about VR, the only way

79
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,825
to access a virtual world and to have agency in it as an avatar

80
00:04:41,985 --> 00:04:43,187
is through a headset.

81
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,866
Right now in games, many people enjoy building up an avatar over hundreds or even thousands

82
00:04:51,886 --> 00:04:55,330
of hours, in some cases, with all its stats and possessions.

83
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:02,097
But being in VR commands 100% of your attention, and many of us can only afford to completely

84
00:05:02,157 --> 00:05:05,681
tune out the real world for a couple of hours a day at the most.

85
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:14,636
So to start with, why not instead engage that same virtual world in different ways throughout the day?

86
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:26,286
So if you're really into that space wizarding world, then on the way home you could on your cell phone have an AR geolocation experience where you collect some ingredients.

87
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:33,913
Then at home on the couch with your tablet you use those ingredients to craft some potions or acquire new spells.

88
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:39,398
With a game controller on your TV, you can fly your wizard spaceship

89
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:42,200
through an asteroid field to the Wizarding Championship,

90
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,964
and then for the really intense wizard duels, you jump into VR

91
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:48,726
and use your newly learned spells.

92
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:53,971
The virtual world and your identity in it remain the same,

93
00:05:54,051 --> 00:05:57,214
but the way you interact with that virtual world is flexible enough

94
00:05:57,334 --> 00:06:01,018
to adjust to your desired depth of engagement from moment to moment.

95
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:05,784
There are non-VR games that have already explored this to some success.

96
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:11,329
But these experiences don't have to be exclusively digital either.

97
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,613
You could go to a themed hotel or escape room or even a theme park

98
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,635
and be recognized as your persistent avatar

99
00:06:19,056 --> 00:06:21,138
with its unique history and traits

100
00:06:21,618 --> 00:06:24,761
and participate in storylines that connect across these.

101
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,021
And a themed location or theme park

102
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:31,582
offers a level of immersion that you can't create at home,

103
00:06:32,502 --> 00:06:33,162
even in VR.

104
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:35,923
You can have face-to-face social interactions

105
00:06:35,943 --> 00:06:37,963
with your family or friends, walk

106
00:06:38,003 --> 00:06:41,704
among elaborate physical sets, actors in costumes,

107
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:43,885
sensational practical effects, thrill rides.

108
00:06:46,185 --> 00:06:48,526
And in the future, those location-based experiences

109
00:06:48,606 --> 00:06:50,766
could even be enhanced by mixed reality glasses

110
00:06:51,307 --> 00:06:54,587
to add magical and impossible elements into an already

111
00:06:54,647 --> 00:06:55,768
elaborate fantasy world.

112
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,803
If you want, you could participate in this out-of-home adventure as your avatar,

113
00:07:02,343 --> 00:07:05,446
and when you return home, your storyline continues in the digital world.

114
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:09,189
The stories you experienced in the physical world

115
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:12,592
could become part of that same ongoing biography.

116
00:07:15,274 --> 00:07:16,435
Our homes are changing too.

117
00:07:17,756 --> 00:07:21,299
As IoT connectivity is catching on,

118
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,842
cloud and edge computing will empower everyday objects

119
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:26,483
with more information and abilities.

120
00:07:27,725 --> 00:07:30,667
The individual object doesn't have to be complex or expensive.

121
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:33,349
A smart speaker isn't very smart on its own.

122
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,712
It can't do speech recognition, natural language processing,

123
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:39,994
speech synthesis without the cloud server that

124
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:41,475
does the computational heavy lifting.

125
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:44,597
But when connected, that little speaker

126
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:46,498
not only has much of the knowledge of the internet

127
00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:49,060
at its disposal, it knows who you are,

128
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,901
what music and podcasts you like,

129
00:07:51,302 --> 00:07:52,683
what time you should leave for the airport.

130
00:07:54,104 --> 00:07:58,408
Those same devices can become access points for persistent virtual worlds as well.

131
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,472
And I think especially toys will follow this trend pretty soon.

132
00:08:04,414 --> 00:08:09,179
You can have a toy droid that understands what you say, answers intelligently, and knows

133
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,003
you and your avatar, all without requiring expensive on-board electronics.

134
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:17,166
Because its brain is actually in the cloud.

135
00:08:18,435 --> 00:08:20,996
This could even be a character that exists seamlessly

136
00:08:21,096 --> 00:08:23,058
both as a physical toy in the real world

137
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:25,759
and as a digital character in the virtual world

138
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,261
and remembers your shared activities in both.

139
00:08:31,282 --> 00:08:33,624
Mixed reality glasses will take this one step further,

140
00:08:34,665 --> 00:08:36,245
allowing fully digital characters

141
00:08:36,426 --> 00:08:38,567
to cross between the real and virtual worlds.

142
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:42,389
MR characters and physical smart toys

143
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,010
could even interact with one another.

144
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,094
Streaming television, real-time rendering, and speech synthesis

145
00:08:51,674 --> 00:08:55,078
could allow for linear content to be personalized on the fly

146
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:57,360
so that an episode of your favorite show

147
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,402
features a cameo of your personal droid

148
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:02,805
or even references the latest adventures you had in VR.

149
00:09:06,349 --> 00:09:08,751
Outside the home, self-driving cars

150
00:09:09,992 --> 00:09:12,174
may well become an entertainment hub and platform.

151
00:09:13,295 --> 00:09:15,158
What better time to dive into a virtual world

152
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:16,960
than when you're trapped in a metal box

153
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,962
that you don't even have to steer anymore?

154
00:09:20,484 --> 00:09:23,167
So moments of sort of tedium and isolation

155
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,211
could actually become opportunities for entertainment

156
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:27,453
and social interaction.

157
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:38,785
In a matter of years, not decades, the same 3D models that are necessary for self-driving

158
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:43,668
cars and autonomous drones to navigate our cities could actually provide the foundation

159
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:46,370
for taking mixed reality out into the street.

160
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:52,315
You could allow to build a whole fictional world that exists layered on top of the real

161
00:09:52,415 --> 00:09:52,515
one.

162
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:59,360
Real AI characters and even friends' avatars could join you in everyday life.

163
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,643
There might be big AR social events where people gather together for a spectacle seen

164
00:10:07,663 --> 00:10:13,028
through mixed reality glasses, like a multiplayer MR narrative, which throughout the week sent

165
00:10:13,048 --> 00:10:17,892
participants all over the city for their individual adventures, only to bring them together in

166
00:10:18,313 --> 00:10:21,135
the same square for the big finale on the weekend.

167
00:10:23,417 --> 00:10:24,998
All of that may feel quite far away.

168
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:27,520
And there are definitely technical hurdles

169
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:30,783
to overcome which are not only beyond our studio,

170
00:10:30,823 --> 00:10:33,345
but even beyond our industry to solve on our own.

171
00:10:34,686 --> 00:10:36,207
So there's backend architecture.

172
00:10:36,227 --> 00:10:38,689
It's 2018.

173
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:39,889
You can't avoid it.

174
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:43,292
There's backend architecture.

175
00:10:43,312 --> 00:10:47,355
There's improved sensing and mapping, fast connectivity,

176
00:10:48,216 --> 00:10:50,097
plausible AI characters, and so on.

177
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:53,660
And without a doubt, by the time we get there,

178
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,882
the ideas I just presented will seem quaint and outdated,

179
00:10:57,962 --> 00:11:01,783
and new ideas and imagination that we haven't even

180
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:03,204
dreamed up yet will emerge.

181
00:11:05,285 --> 00:11:07,526
I think it's also important to briefly mention

182
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:08,746
social responsibility.

183
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:13,028
This is not just about the obvious dangers of technology

184
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:15,770
that allows people to live in different realities,

185
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,751
because to an extent, that's already happening right now.

186
00:11:20,192 --> 00:11:24,276
But I think there's also just a more basic dimension to that.

187
00:11:25,077 --> 00:11:27,979
There's lots of tangible, useful applications

188
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:30,502
of these technologies that I mentioned for education,

189
00:11:30,662 --> 00:11:32,583
health care, civil engineering, and so on.

190
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:35,420
But what I've been talking about is just entertainment.

191
00:11:36,241 --> 00:11:39,683
And as much as I like the idea of filling the real world

192
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:41,744
with magical virtual things,

193
00:11:42,545 --> 00:11:45,707
we can't also solve some of the most basic societal problems,

194
00:11:46,107 --> 00:11:47,868
then I don't think we've really earned the right

195
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:50,570
to use technology to make reality look nicer than it is

196
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:54,393
or cover up problems we'd rather not think about.

197
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,850
You can imagine that you'd end up in a black mirror version

198
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,311
of where you're walking down the street with your virtual pets

199
00:12:04,531 --> 00:12:06,431
past the homeless tents on the sidewalk.

200
00:12:06,451 --> 00:12:08,351
And I don't think we want to really end up there.

201
00:12:08,371 --> 00:12:13,813
So anyway, that future may be a ways away.

202
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,493
But I think the tools to begin mixing

203
00:12:17,253 --> 00:12:19,494
real and virtual worlds are already

204
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:21,194
available to everyone right now.

205
00:12:22,094 --> 00:12:23,654
And I'm not just talking about ARKit and ARCore.

206
00:12:25,865 --> 00:12:29,268
Last year when I moved back to San Francisco, I had to furnish an empty apartment.

207
00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:34,673
And so the first thing I did, just for fun really, was to make a rough 3D model of the

208
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:39,998
flat and I just took a couple of dozen snapshots and fed them through photogrammetry software.

209
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:44,481
And then I blocked out the furniture arrangement with a few cubes based on the measurements

210
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,923
from the furniture store website.

211
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:51,683
And then I put on my VR headset, and I stood in my real living room,

212
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:54,165
and at the same time in my virtual living room,

213
00:12:54,865 --> 00:12:56,207
just to see how that layout would feel.

214
00:12:57,808 --> 00:13:00,350
And all that was required for that was really a point-and-shoot camera,

215
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,452
a laptop, and a consumer VR headset.

216
00:13:03,953 --> 00:13:06,596
At the moment, we're still restricted by cables and sensors,

217
00:13:07,196 --> 00:13:09,038
but within a hardware generation or two,

218
00:13:09,598 --> 00:13:13,321
untethered, inside-out tracking headsets might free us up from that.

219
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,085
And I'm actually looking forward to just making different skins

220
00:13:17,105 --> 00:13:19,186
for my apartment so I can then freely walk around

221
00:13:19,246 --> 00:13:20,166
in the VR spaces.

222
00:13:22,447 --> 00:13:24,507
Initially, this probably has to be done manually.

223
00:13:24,547 --> 00:13:26,568
But I think very quickly, there will

224
00:13:26,608 --> 00:13:30,109
be tools, games, and experiences that procedurally match up

225
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:32,109
walls and objects of the right size

226
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:35,410
between fictional and real world, both for VR and MR.

227
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,771
So your armchair could become a captain's chair in a spaceship,

228
00:13:39,211 --> 00:13:40,891
your coffee table a control console,

229
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:42,232
and your wall a window to space.

230
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:45,917
Eventually, it's not just your living room you could map and skin.

231
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:52,942
Take a few coolers or trash bins out into your backyard, scan the environment and props

232
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:57,285
with your phone or headset, and skin them like the fictional world of your choice.

233
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,381
Then invite a few of your friends over with their untethered headsets, and now you're

234
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:08,042
together running and dodging behind cover, both in the real world and in the fictional

235
00:14:08,102 --> 00:14:14,503
version of it, having a story adventure, playing sci-fi VR or MR paintball, or fighting side

236
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:16,363
by side against waves of AI enemies.

237
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:23,705
Network this with the backyard of a friend in another city, and in the virtual world,

238
00:14:24,145 --> 00:14:26,285
her and your backyard become the same place.

239
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:29,921
Her friends in her backyard, your friends in yours,

240
00:14:30,142 --> 00:14:32,083
moving freely, hanging out, playing games

241
00:14:32,724 --> 00:14:35,306
in physical and virtual spaces simultaneously.

242
00:14:37,068 --> 00:14:40,671
The relationship between physical world and virtual worlds

243
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:42,132
may turn out to be very fluid.

244
00:14:43,313 --> 00:14:46,176
One virtual space may connect to multiple real places,

245
00:14:46,976 --> 00:14:50,780
and a single real location can have many virtual layers

246
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,420
to choose from.

247
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,252
It actually seems unlikely that we will converge on a single metaverse

248
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:59,754
when we can choose from many worlds or even customize our own.

249
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:06,798
So, as technology advances, the digital and the real world

250
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:08,900
don't have to remain two separate places.

251
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:13,342
The metaverse doesn't have to stay trapped inside a headset.

252
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:15,263
It can end up being all around us.

253
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,859
We're going to move on to the panel discussion now.

254
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,322
And recently ILMxLAB and The Void,

255
00:15:24,603 --> 00:15:28,126
using Epic's Unreal Engine, created Star Wars Secrets

256
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,528
of the Empire, an experience that

257
00:15:30,568 --> 00:15:33,030
is a first step in exploring what

258
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,532
future immersive multiplayer content that

259
00:15:35,612 --> 00:15:37,774
mixes physical and virtual worlds can be.

260
00:15:39,035 --> 00:15:41,337
So while I play the trailer, please welcome to the stage

261
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:44,560
Camille Cellucci, head of production at The Void.

262
00:15:45,358 --> 00:15:47,539
Judah Graham, Senior Producer at Epic Games,

263
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,900
and our moderator for this discussion, David Collins,

264
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:53,361
Sound Mixer and Editor at Skywalker Sound.

265
00:16:00,064 --> 00:16:01,524
This is Von Bonner.

266
00:16:01,644 --> 00:16:05,306
I have an assignment for you.

267
00:16:05,326 --> 00:16:07,967
The Rebellion needs you, and we don't have much time.

268
00:16:10,007 --> 00:16:12,388
You must work together.

269
00:16:12,528 --> 00:16:13,529
You must not fail.

270
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:31,801
In disguise, your team's mission is to recover Imperial intelligence critical to our survival.

271
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:41,208
You're with me. The rest of you, get on that skiff. Do your best to act Imperial.

272
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,491
Looks like you'll have to fight your way out.

273
00:16:57,206 --> 00:16:57,906
What is that?

274
00:16:59,628 --> 00:17:12,936
This could be a threat to our entire existence.

275
00:17:12,956 --> 00:17:13,537
Morning everyone.

276
00:17:13,557 --> 00:17:15,378
Thank you so much for joining us this morning.

277
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:19,341
And thank you very much, Mon, for that fascinating talk.

278
00:17:19,381 --> 00:17:20,101
That was really fantastic.

279
00:17:20,121 --> 00:17:20,902
Give her a round of applause for that.

280
00:17:20,922 --> 00:17:21,142
Thank you.

281
00:17:21,162 --> 00:17:21,402
Thank you.

282
00:17:21,422 --> 00:17:23,844
Thank you.

283
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:24,084
Thank you.

284
00:17:24,104 --> 00:17:24,284
Thank you.

285
00:17:26,153 --> 00:17:28,774
It's very exciting, and thank you for joining us here at GDC today.

286
00:17:28,794 --> 00:17:32,416
I am very excited to host this conversation with Mo and Camille and Judah.

287
00:17:33,857 --> 00:17:35,978
You just saw the trailer for Star Wars Secrets of the Empire.

288
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:40,741
Just curious, how many of you have experienced, first of all, how many of you heard of Secrets

289
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:41,641
of the Empire in the Void?

290
00:17:42,442 --> 00:17:45,363
And how many of you have experienced Secrets of the Empire?

291
00:17:46,423 --> 00:17:46,963
OK, great.

292
00:17:47,183 --> 00:17:47,783
Great, great, great.

293
00:17:48,144 --> 00:17:49,284
Well, before we get started, I want

294
00:17:49,304 --> 00:17:52,605
to tell you a little bit about who I am and why I'm up here.

295
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:55,066
So I am a sound editor, re-recording mixer

296
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:57,167
at Skywalker Sound with a long history

297
00:17:57,187 --> 00:17:58,588
of working in interactive.

298
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:02,970
I was at LucasArts for over a decade, PlayStation,

299
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,491
and in digital health at Akili Interactive Labs.

300
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:11,473
So I'm here because I am so passionate about this.

301
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:14,474
I experienced it recently at the Glendale Galleria, which

302
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:15,195
just opened.

303
00:18:15,275 --> 00:18:15,415
Yeah.

304
00:18:15,955 --> 00:18:19,296
My wife and I went through it together, and I was just totally blown away.

305
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:24,478
Even having worked on it a little bit, I voiced some Stormtrooper characters in the experience,

306
00:18:24,498 --> 00:18:30,059
but it did not prepare me for sort of the hyper-reality of the experience.

307
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:34,821
I wanted to start just by having you introduce yourselves to everyone here in the audience.

308
00:18:35,617 --> 00:18:41,159
Sure, well I'm Camille Salucci and I have a fairly long background in visual effects.

309
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:46,841
I feel like I was born at Industrial Light & Magic and got some good legs there and went

310
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:51,703
out and ended up being a couple of the big credits would be I was the visual effects

311
00:18:51,743 --> 00:18:52,823
producer on Titanic.

312
00:18:53,504 --> 00:18:59,266
I've done about 35 films, more recently The Walk that Robert Zemeckis directed and was

313
00:19:00,707 --> 00:19:04,429
The line producer on The Little Prince, for those of you who had a chance to see it on Netflix.

314
00:19:05,749 --> 00:19:08,431
So I come from that background of animation and visual effects.

315
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:13,874
More recently, I learned about... I wanted to work in VR and sort of transition my career.

316
00:19:14,054 --> 00:19:19,597
And literally two years ago, I paid a full price ticket, sitting at GDC, learning as much as I can,

317
00:19:19,677 --> 00:19:23,479
and wondering if someday maybe I would have enough knowledge to sit on a panel.

318
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,241
I'm not sure about the formal, but I guess I'm here.

319
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:31,243
So, anyway, and then I was at Google Spotlight Stories,

320
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,724
for those of you who know about their VR storytelling,

321
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:37,126
and I've produced a couple of things there before The Void came

322
00:19:37,366 --> 00:19:39,227
and asked me to join them as head of production,

323
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:42,968
which is just, I'm just in the month and a half or so since I've been there.

324
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:44,329
Very cool.

325
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:47,130
So, I'm Judah Graham.

326
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,512
I'm a senior producer at Epic Games.

327
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,713
I was with ILMxLAB for...

328
00:19:55,718 --> 00:19:58,341
Several years. My background is mainly in games.

329
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:03,686
I've spent, I don't know, the last 20 years in games,

330
00:20:05,268 --> 00:20:08,471
working at Red Storm back in Raleigh,

331
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:12,776
and then I decided to come out and work with Activision for a good bit.

332
00:20:13,717 --> 00:20:16,920
Did Call of Duty, and then after Call of Duty, I...

333
00:20:19,447 --> 00:20:24,789
I was so fascinated when I put my first headset on and saw the potential of VR.

334
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:31,912
So it made a natural fit for me to go work with Vicky and the crew at ILMxLAB for a while.

335
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:37,534
When we got the opportunity to go down and kind of check out The Void, it was a brand

336
00:20:37,554 --> 00:20:38,595
new platform at the time.

337
00:20:39,876 --> 00:20:44,738
It was one of those kind of transformative moments where you just walk through it and

338
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:47,819
you thought, oh my gosh, this is where the future of...

339
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:54,604
of VR and entertainment is, it's the hyper aspect of it that I think really kind of pulls you in.

340
00:20:54,664 --> 00:21:02,508
And so once we had the opportunity to work on that, it was just fantastic.

341
00:21:02,568 --> 00:21:06,970
I mean, it's kind of, it's definitely on that forward thinking, you know,

342
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,871
future of where this entertainment can go.

343
00:21:10,922 --> 00:21:12,303
You mentioned hyperreality just now.

344
00:21:13,084 --> 00:21:14,165
I mentioned it as well.

345
00:21:14,626 --> 00:21:16,528
Can you just talk a little bit, for those that don't know,

346
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:19,632
about what hyperreality is at The Void,

347
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:20,573
when you talk about that?

348
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:21,474
Sure.

349
00:21:21,634 --> 00:21:24,157
So the idea being that

350
00:21:26,132 --> 00:21:29,034
To start with, first of all, I want to acknowledge one thing,

351
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:31,395
and that was Curtis Hickman was supposed to be here today

352
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,255
on the panel.

353
00:21:32,295 --> 00:21:34,176
And some of you might have come to see Curtis.

354
00:21:35,297 --> 00:21:39,199
And unfortunately, rarely do we have so much rain in San

355
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:40,660
Francisco that flights can't get in.

356
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,761
But he couldn't get here.

357
00:21:42,841 --> 00:21:47,223
So Judah graciously joined us, which is fantastic.

358
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:48,104
Thank you, Kelly.

359
00:21:48,384 --> 00:21:51,586
And he knows a lot more about the producing of this, for sure.

360
00:21:52,967 --> 00:21:57,369
But in terms of hyperreality, as some of you might know, Curtis is a magician, and his

361
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:05,294
idea is always about being able to suspend disbelief and do whatever we can to create

362
00:22:05,314 --> 00:22:07,676
an illusion that your brain believes.

363
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:12,057
And so a VR headset on its own is pretty incredible,

364
00:22:12,357 --> 00:22:15,218
but when you add things like physical location,

365
00:22:15,338 --> 00:22:16,799
walls you can physically touch,

366
00:22:17,239 --> 00:22:19,619
heat that you feel on Mustafar,

367
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:21,420
or wind that you feel,

368
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,181
or mist, or rumbles in the floor,

369
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:29,242
it really goes a long way towards making it an experience that is...

370
00:22:30,103 --> 00:22:35,306
Completely, hopefully, convincing for the brain to say, I am here.

371
00:22:35,926 --> 00:22:42,551
And so hyperreality takes it to that next level from sort of virtual reality in the headset

372
00:22:42,631 --> 00:22:47,254
to a full sensory experience for people to enjoy.

373
00:22:48,665 --> 00:22:51,067
The one-to-one is so powerful when you experience that.

374
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:53,228
I mean, your brain is telling you what you're seeing,

375
00:22:53,268 --> 00:22:55,430
and then you're experiencing with all of your other senses.

376
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,011
I'm just blown away by it.

377
00:22:57,331 --> 00:22:59,513
And Judy, can you talk a little bit about your work with Epic

378
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:01,254
and working together to bring that to life?

379
00:23:01,855 --> 00:23:05,898
So Epic, obviously, has one of the best platforms.

380
00:23:05,978 --> 00:23:09,761
And its true interest is really in helping

381
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:11,943
to stay on the cutting edge and help partner

382
00:23:11,963 --> 00:23:13,984
with companies like ILM, XLAB.

383
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:25,195
I think for a big part of what the VOID project in terms of the challenges that we faced in

384
00:23:25,235 --> 00:23:30,639
development from ILMxLAB, there's a lot of firsts that had to go into this.

385
00:23:30,699 --> 00:23:40,306
So first time for putting a headset on and tracking people through a VR space but being

386
00:23:41,948 --> 00:23:43,449
driven by motion capture as well.

387
00:23:43,469 --> 00:23:45,530
So you have multiplayer along with...

388
00:23:47,115 --> 00:23:50,658
The avatar is being driven in a virtual space untethered.

389
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:53,901
So all of those things that were kind of first,

390
00:23:53,981 --> 00:23:58,924
I think it made a lot of sense for Epic Games

391
00:23:58,944 --> 00:24:02,767
to kind of dive in and really see what types of things

392
00:24:02,807 --> 00:24:07,711
could potentially add tech back to the engine

393
00:24:07,751 --> 00:24:09,112
for the long term.

394
00:24:09,152 --> 00:24:11,914
So since this was really one of those, like,

395
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:22,005
It was just a challenge I think on all aspects of trying to handle the amount of data that

396
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:22,966
we had to process.

397
00:24:23,386 --> 00:24:31,271
So from Epic just kind of being able to step in and give some consulting and some advice

398
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:38,976
walked us through the process for animation and then rigging characters and doing blend

399
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:43,558
states and it just became a natural fit.

400
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:51,401
Not to mention, you know, building a virtual space that is one-to-one with a physical space

401
00:24:51,421 --> 00:24:56,122
that you walk through that creates just such an immersive platform.

402
00:24:56,142 --> 00:25:00,143
I mean, I experienced fear, I experienced, you know, exhilaration, joy, I was physically

403
00:25:00,203 --> 00:25:04,464
touching things, you know, grabbing, solving puzzles, going through everything.

404
00:25:04,484 --> 00:25:08,105
I mean, that really does seem like a monumental leap forward in VR.

405
00:25:09,105 --> 00:25:10,986
Yeah, and I'll just jump in.

406
00:25:11,046 --> 00:25:13,668
I think one of the things that I love most about The Void

407
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:17,131
is that there is that level of the one-to-one

408
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:18,792
where things really match up.

409
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:22,755
But then there's another level of illusion and magic

410
00:25:22,815 --> 00:25:23,756
that sits on top of that.

411
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:28,960
My brother was a very intelligent person.

412
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,081
He works in medical research and has a PhD.

413
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:35,264
He went to see their previous experience, the Ghostbusters

414
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:37,105
one in New York.

415
00:25:37,505 --> 00:25:39,607
And afterwards, I talked to him.

416
00:25:39,647 --> 00:25:42,529
And I said, oh, yeah, I did the same thing in a warehouse in

417
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:45,370
LA, and he said, how could you do that in a warehouse?

418
00:25:46,331 --> 00:25:48,292
It has to be at least like four stories for

419
00:25:48,312 --> 00:25:49,253
the elevator, right?

420
00:25:53,628 --> 00:25:56,549
And I basically had to tell him, like, you were never in an elevator.

421
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:57,790
You know?

422
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,450
And that's really...

423
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:08,053
For me, that highlighted the magic of this kind of VR, that it can create memories that

424
00:26:08,173 --> 00:26:11,135
feel as real as real experiences that you've had.

425
00:26:11,757 --> 00:26:13,278
Because the blend is totally seamless.

426
00:26:13,318 --> 00:26:15,279
I mean, I mentioned I went through the experience

427
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,280
with my wife, and I was just like,

428
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,062
at one point, you have to cross this chasm,

429
00:26:20,442 --> 00:26:21,602
and you're convinced it's real,

430
00:26:21,742 --> 00:26:23,543
because you're getting all of the sensory information

431
00:26:23,563 --> 00:26:25,324
plus visuals, and I'm just like, yeah,

432
00:26:25,524 --> 00:26:26,825
and I'm holding her hand as we're walking through,

433
00:26:26,845 --> 00:26:28,966
two stormtroopers holding hands, it's totally normal,

434
00:26:29,947 --> 00:26:32,148
on this imperial outpost, no big deal,

435
00:26:32,428 --> 00:26:33,449
they don't know we're spies.

436
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:37,331
But yeah, you really are crossing the chasm there

437
00:26:37,391 --> 00:26:39,512
with the one-to-one, in a way.

438
00:26:41,923 --> 00:26:48,727
You know, one traditional tool that storytellers have had for immersive entertainment is control

439
00:26:48,787 --> 00:26:49,528
over camera.

440
00:26:50,128 --> 00:26:54,331
And when I went through it, I was really struck by how not only is it obviously in VR, it's

441
00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:58,033
completely 3D, but you're telling a story, an immersive story.

442
00:26:58,914 --> 00:27:00,675
But not only do you not have control of the camera,

443
00:27:00,695 --> 00:27:03,178
therefore, what I'm looking at, what I'm focused on,

444
00:27:03,338 --> 00:27:05,740
but it's a group of people all focused on different things.

445
00:27:06,261 --> 00:27:10,145
How do you see that, what some might see initially

446
00:27:10,165 --> 00:27:12,227
as a disadvantage, how do you see that as an advantage

447
00:27:12,487 --> 00:27:15,670
to this kind of hyperreality and as a creative tool?

448
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:18,754
That's a really good question.

449
00:27:19,594 --> 00:27:19,855
I think,

450
00:27:21,893 --> 00:27:31,202
Social aspects of VR is one of the things that's kind of lagged through VR basically coming into the spotlight and mainstream.

451
00:27:31,222 --> 00:27:38,830
But I think being able to give, I mean, one of the really cool things about the Voids platform.

452
00:27:39,831 --> 00:27:46,615
is that you can drive individual experiences as much as you can the social and group aspect of the experience.

453
00:27:47,115 --> 00:27:53,038
So where you have, you can have full conversations because you're mic'd up and you're talking to the person next to you,

454
00:27:53,118 --> 00:27:57,801
you're seeing them, you know how to navigate around them, but at the same time you...

455
00:28:01,258 --> 00:28:04,820
As developers for VR, we can send individual experiences,

456
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:08,402
whether it's auditory or, because you're not truly

457
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:13,565
in the exact same space, you can send visual differences.

458
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,266
So I could be looking at one thing that's

459
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:18,108
completely different than, say, Camille or you.

460
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:22,070
And then driving different social aspects of that, too.

461
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,752
So you can part ways and then come back and have.

462
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:35,409
Like, group effort, team driven experiences where you're, you know, one group on one side

463
00:28:35,469 --> 00:28:44,271
is actually solving one problem that converges and then you get back together and meet a

464
00:28:44,311 --> 00:28:44,791
common goal.

465
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:50,192
So it's like, I think the void having that untethered aspect I think is just a.

466
00:28:51,228 --> 00:28:52,789
A good driver for social.

467
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:57,212
I think also on what you're saying about sort of turning that to your advantage.

468
00:28:59,254 --> 00:29:03,036
One thing I think for these kinds of immersive storytelling experiences

469
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:07,660
is that as sort of the storytellers have to have a little bit like looser grip on it.

470
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,443
You can't, you know, in a movie you control literally everything what people look at.

471
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:14,925
But what the nice thing about...

472
00:29:15,705 --> 00:29:19,028
This medium is that you create more of a narrative framework.

473
00:29:19,648 --> 00:29:22,470
But the experience that every person going through it has

474
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,011
is still their personal experience.

475
00:29:24,051 --> 00:29:25,612
You know, people do different things.

476
00:29:25,652 --> 00:29:26,533
They go different places.

477
00:29:26,573 --> 00:29:27,553
They look at different things.

478
00:29:27,893 --> 00:29:30,975
And that's sort of how people experience the real world

479
00:29:31,056 --> 00:29:31,616
as well, right?

480
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:35,158
And so I think what, and that's certainly true

481
00:29:35,378 --> 00:29:36,999
as sort of we progress to like, you know,

482
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,380
bigger social VR worlds.

483
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:38,681
I think.

484
00:29:39,982 --> 00:29:43,907
We can't really necessarily control the narrative,

485
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:47,532
and shouldn't try to control the narrative down to the last detail,

486
00:29:48,093 --> 00:29:50,917
but create basically stories and story frameworks

487
00:29:51,437 --> 00:29:54,421
that leave enough room for individuals to have their own story in that.

488
00:29:55,676 --> 00:30:00,138
Yeah, I would say one of the things that, a term that I learned actually from Vicky,

489
00:30:00,818 --> 00:30:08,741
is we aren't, you know, it's been looked at for a long time about storytelling.

490
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:13,903
And what we're really moving into in this new world is it's more about story living.

491
00:30:14,003 --> 00:30:18,404
You know, we are creating spaces and worlds where people have a chance to...

492
00:30:19,665 --> 00:30:24,729
live out their own stories and create their own stories within a framework that we design.

493
00:30:25,329 --> 00:30:30,953
So it's got some complexity to it because there's definitely a narrative that we want

494
00:30:30,993 --> 00:30:34,796
people to experience, but we want to give them enough freedom to experience it in a

495
00:30:34,836 --> 00:30:35,437
personal way.

496
00:30:36,077 --> 00:30:41,742
And in that way, our hope is, especially with the social aspect, which we're really

497
00:30:42,622 --> 00:30:48,989
We love to have that part of it, because we think it's a critical part in VR in the future,

498
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:55,857
is allowing people to have that experience with each other and carry memories.

499
00:30:56,197 --> 00:30:59,541
So in essence, we're really making memories is what I like to think about.

500
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:02,484
And I think that that is successful even with this,

501
00:31:02,524 --> 00:31:04,906
because when you have people coming out of the void

502
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,529
experience, they start actually telling their own stories

503
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:08,170
of what happened.

504
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,312
They're going like, oh, and then he shot at this guy,

505
00:31:10,332 --> 00:31:11,153
and I was doing this thing.

506
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:15,197
And so they had their own story within that framework.

507
00:31:15,837 --> 00:31:20,000
Well, let's talk about that framework and get into that a little bit, because the framework,

508
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,304
you're still having to build it and kind of anticipate what the boundaries are, you know,

509
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:29,947
and create, in certain cases, maybe the illusion of choice versus actual choice, you know,

510
00:31:29,987 --> 00:31:32,688
creating set pieces or arenas or something.

511
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:37,113
And obviously storytelling, film, books, there isn't choice.

512
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:38,434
It's a guided narrative.

513
00:31:38,975 --> 00:31:41,317
Do you see that going away and breaking down completely?

514
00:31:41,417 --> 00:31:43,119
Or is that illusion of choice always

515
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:45,181
going to be a part of even something

516
00:31:45,241 --> 00:31:47,823
as open as a group experience in immersive VR?

517
00:31:49,677 --> 00:31:56,144
I'd say from my perspective, I think that you're, to have, one of the things that I

518
00:31:56,184 --> 00:32:01,129
think people enjoy is being part of a world that has been created and been curated by

519
00:32:01,189 --> 00:32:01,570
someone.

520
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:07,035
And so, certainly from our perspective, or I should say from my perspective, I'm still

521
00:32:07,075 --> 00:32:10,018
learning everything about the full void perspective being a bit new there.

522
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:14,200
But what I can say is that I think that curated experience,

523
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,941
creating those worlds, is important.

524
00:32:17,461 --> 00:32:20,882
And so giving people and trying to think about what the choice is.

525
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:27,424
One of the terrific things we have with AVOID is we get data from our users now

526
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:30,125
in a real way, in a significant way.

527
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:33,987
We actually have people lining up to take surveys, which is sort of unheard of.

528
00:32:35,007 --> 00:32:37,648
Usually you're begging people to take the survey, like at GDC.

529
00:32:38,949 --> 00:32:41,249
I'm going to fill out your surveys.

530
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:43,690
But often at the Void, because people want to express what

531
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,451
happened, they want somewhere to share it, somewhere to

532
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:47,012
talk about it.

533
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:50,173
And I've even seen people who don't know each other come out

534
00:32:50,253 --> 00:32:53,854
being close, talking as if they were really good friends,

535
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:55,695
and they didn't know each other when they walked in.

536
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:01,394
So, but I think if it's just left where there's no curation,

537
00:33:01,774 --> 00:33:04,556
from my perspective, it's kind of a little bit on the

538
00:33:05,477 --> 00:33:08,319
choose your own adventure level, where that might take

539
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,362
off for a bit, but I think it often comes back to a curated

540
00:33:11,402 --> 00:33:11,942
experience.

541
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:18,268
Interesting. And now in terms of world building, say, versus a content play, right?

542
00:33:18,308 --> 00:33:21,570
Choose your own adventure. I mean that to me thinks about branching story paths,

543
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:25,273
which means you have to build all of these different story paths.

544
00:33:25,553 --> 00:33:29,575
Do you see, how do you see that balance moving forward then,

545
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:32,177
in terms of the world building being the appeal,

546
00:33:32,837 --> 00:33:36,799
or actually having customized stories for everyone that goes through,

547
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:38,380
or some limited version of that?

548
00:33:38,881 --> 00:33:39,981
Anyone, any thoughts on that?

549
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:49,736
I think we're still so early in exploring that, and I think that there's definitely

550
00:33:50,176 --> 00:33:55,180
really interesting developments that can happen in that field over the next ten years or so,

551
00:33:55,461 --> 00:33:55,781
let's say.

552
00:33:57,682 --> 00:34:05,229
One thing, I think it's impossible to create the kind of depth of experiences,

553
00:34:05,269 --> 00:34:11,053
both story and worldwide, that could support something like the metaverse idea.

554
00:34:11,454 --> 00:34:17,378
From a content creator perspective, you can't write hundreds of hours of branching narratives.

555
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,499
So I think...

556
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:24,444
We have to figure out things like letting users participate

557
00:34:24,664 --> 00:34:27,647
in a meaningful way without breaking the fiction.

558
00:34:27,707 --> 00:34:30,429
So user-generated content becoming part of that.

559
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:32,291
And procedural content.

560
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:34,132
And so procedural world building, I think,

561
00:34:34,192 --> 00:34:37,195
is something that is really exciting.

562
00:34:37,255 --> 00:34:40,517
And you look at something like No Man's Sky that not only

563
00:34:40,638 --> 00:34:43,260
created this enormous universe, but created it

564
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,461
with a six-gigabyte footprint.

565
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:44,741
And so.

566
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:53,793
I think if we can, for example, figure out how to describe Mustafar in a procedural way,

567
00:34:53,853 --> 00:34:57,158
then you can say, okay, I need a hundred more square miles of Mustafar,

568
00:34:57,319 --> 00:34:59,562
and you can do that in an efficient way.

569
00:35:00,549 --> 00:35:05,331
And it's much more experimental, but I think there's even interesting work starting to happen on

570
00:35:05,791 --> 00:35:13,153
procedural narratives, on story engines, on creating systems that can create narrative situations.

571
00:35:13,313 --> 00:35:18,555
And so I think if we can sort of push that further, then there's an opportunity there to build worlds

572
00:35:18,595 --> 00:35:23,316
that are really complex, that can sustain themselves, where you don't, as a story creator,

573
00:35:23,356 --> 00:35:26,497
have to create thousands and thousands of hours of content.

574
00:35:27,672 --> 00:35:28,532
That's really interesting.

575
00:35:28,552 --> 00:35:31,994
And one of the things you brought up in your talk, too, was this sort of cross-platform

576
00:35:32,074 --> 00:35:35,856
idea of feeding that customizable content.

577
00:35:35,936 --> 00:35:40,698
Any thoughts that you can give us about a future vision you may have for that?

578
00:35:40,818 --> 00:35:47,122
How people will experience that via cross-platform and then go into an immersive experience?

579
00:35:48,302 --> 00:35:53,045
Are you talking about cross-platform being multiple platforms, whether it's your phone?

580
00:35:53,065 --> 00:35:54,245
Your phone, exactly.

581
00:35:54,466 --> 00:35:54,706
Yeah.

582
00:35:54,746 --> 00:35:54,846
Yeah.

583
00:35:54,966 --> 00:35:56,066
I mean, we've...

584
00:35:57,676 --> 00:36:06,539
When we started working on The Void and trying to come up with a really good design and something that would be engaging for the masses,

585
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:12,221
one of the things that's really challenging is, well, especially from a games background,

586
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:22,845
we all know what drives gaming and what drives storytelling and how to compel a player or a user going through the experience.

587
00:36:23,165 --> 00:36:24,805
How to pull them along through.

588
00:36:27,955 --> 00:36:30,637
choice and design and layout.

589
00:36:30,957 --> 00:36:37,241
I think one of the things that was really tough with this is we kept trying to pull

590
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:40,704
back and simplify because there's an education process.

591
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:45,807
We would do some user tests and people would put the headset on and they get lost.

592
00:36:45,827 --> 00:36:46,708
They didn't know what to do.

593
00:36:46,728 --> 00:36:50,550
It was the sensory overload of this new world, this new experience.

594
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:57,793
For the first time, it became very difficult for them to just kind of, oh, what do I do?

595
00:36:57,853 --> 00:36:58,293
Can I touch?

596
00:36:58,373 --> 00:36:59,293
Oh, I can touch this.

597
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:04,235
And then they have to turn around and sit down and kind of then, oh, they were missing

598
00:37:04,575 --> 00:37:06,756
dialogue if we had dialogue that was too complex.

599
00:37:06,796 --> 00:37:14,519
So I think there's a phase of both, it's part of the adoption process, but there's a phase

600
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:18,740
of getting people comfortable in that environment and making sure that they're...

601
00:37:20,136 --> 00:37:21,638
enjoying it and can function with it.

602
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:31,989
And then automatically the next step for them is more complex choice or diverging storylines.

603
00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:35,493
I think at that point they could go into different directions.

604
00:37:37,947 --> 00:37:43,391
As this matures, and what's exciting about the Void platform and what Epic Games is doing

605
00:37:43,431 --> 00:37:52,156
long term by supporting these types of hyper-reality platforms or cutting edge platforms is by

606
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:57,380
doing that and supporting that, we're learning how fast this adoption is happening and staying

607
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,720
on the cutting edge.

608
00:38:01,264 --> 00:38:12,780
These features can be used by the masses, and as a whole, I believe those all contribute back to the main goal, which is how this progresses in the future.

609
00:38:13,539 --> 00:38:18,683
One of the things, just real quick, on cross-platform that we're excited about and we're actively

610
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:24,528
talking about, so it's future but I don't think it's 20 years in the future, but one

611
00:38:24,548 --> 00:38:29,431
of the things you'll start seeing for sure is the interrelated content across platforms.

612
00:38:29,952 --> 00:38:36,677
So talking with an AR experience that you might have on your phone, that for someone

613
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:38,278
who's really into that world.

614
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:40,339
There will be connections and tangents.

615
00:38:40,379 --> 00:38:44,941
We're working across various companies to find the ways where those things connect.

616
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:48,623
Or you might have, you know, you might experience something at the void, but then have an opportunity

617
00:38:48,663 --> 00:38:53,345
to go deeper into that world at home with your own VR headset.

618
00:38:53,445 --> 00:38:56,026
So really working on how can we connect.

619
00:38:56,506 --> 00:39:00,948
Well, having someone who is only going to do the one experience, have that be complete

620
00:39:00,968 --> 00:39:07,210
enough for them, but someone who is interested in going across experiences or is a real fan

621
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:13,753
of that work, making it rewarding for them to see interconnections and have a deeper

622
00:39:13,793 --> 00:39:14,673
and richer experience.

623
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:18,114
And I think it's important, again, not to think about sort of...

624
00:39:19,215 --> 00:39:22,918
These virtual worlds are something that only exists in a VR headset.

625
00:39:23,158 --> 00:39:26,521
You can very easily imagine asymmetrical experiences,

626
00:39:26,641 --> 00:39:29,524
especially right now, I think a lot of people that are developing for VR

627
00:39:29,724 --> 00:39:31,666
are struggling with the size of the market.

628
00:39:31,686 --> 00:39:36,850
If you look at stuff like VRChat that took off a lot,

629
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:40,173
the reason why it became so popular is because...

630
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:44,094
You didn't have to be in a VR headset to participate.

631
00:39:44,354 --> 00:39:47,257
At any point in time, a large number of the people in VRChat

632
00:39:47,337 --> 00:39:51,340
are actually just on a desktop watching other people that have headsets.

633
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,584
And so you could easily imagine designing experiences where, you know...

634
00:39:57,377 --> 00:39:59,658
If you want to be a Jedi and have a lightsaber, you're in VR,

635
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:01,679
but if you just want to run around with a blaster,

636
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:03,180
you can do that with a game controller.

637
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,881
And those people being in the same world

638
00:40:06,962 --> 00:40:08,222
and still having those interactions,

639
00:40:08,262 --> 00:40:10,263
some people in VR, some people outside of VR.

640
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:13,904
That's interesting, too, to think about cross-platform

641
00:40:13,964 --> 00:40:16,906
versus the idea of the newness of the experience

642
00:40:16,946 --> 00:40:18,826
every time someone walks into, say, Secrets of the Empire

643
00:40:19,187 --> 00:40:20,347
versus looking forward.

644
00:40:20,787 --> 00:40:22,508
Because do you see cross-platform maybe

645
00:40:22,548 --> 00:40:23,909
as even a training tool to...

646
00:40:25,469 --> 00:40:28,951
to experience these worlds that you're building.

647
00:40:28,992 --> 00:40:31,193
For example, I had no idea where I was going,

648
00:40:31,213 --> 00:40:33,794
and that was part of the illusion and part of the experience,

649
00:40:33,834 --> 00:40:35,335
was the unveiling of the world.

650
00:40:35,395 --> 00:40:37,857
But I could see maybe with cross-platform,

651
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:39,918
knowing exactly where I'm going,

652
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:43,594
If I step into it because I'm already so invested,

653
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,575
is that something that you're thinking about in the future?

654
00:40:46,655 --> 00:40:50,117
Or how does that work possibly as a training tool for showing up?

655
00:40:50,637 --> 00:40:52,418
I think you're absolutely right.

656
00:40:52,478 --> 00:40:55,139
And as Judah said, especially at the moment,

657
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,420
people are not used to VR.

658
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,901
And so trying to tell them a complex story in VR

659
00:40:58,941 --> 00:40:59,961
can be really overwhelming.

660
00:41:00,061 --> 00:41:03,663
It's really hard to drive a complicated narrative.

661
00:41:04,364 --> 00:41:07,608
I think audiences will mature and be able to take on more of that,

662
00:41:07,668 --> 00:41:14,357
but if you can basically set up a storyline outside of that location-based VR experience

663
00:41:14,397 --> 00:41:16,660
and people already know what it's about,

664
00:41:17,301 --> 00:41:22,648
then that can complement those more visceral location-based VR experiences.

665
00:41:23,365 --> 00:41:26,827
And in particular, if you then can have a persistent character

666
00:41:26,887 --> 00:41:29,028
that goes across those things, so you're already

667
00:41:29,128 --> 00:41:30,709
not only invested in the world, but you're

668
00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:32,610
invested sort of in your role in the world,

669
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,052
and you play that character both at home

670
00:41:35,272 --> 00:41:36,893
and in a location-based experience,

671
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:37,973
I think it would be interesting.

672
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:41,355
If I can just step in there.

673
00:41:41,495 --> 00:41:43,036
And in Tim's keynote yesterday, he

674
00:41:44,457 --> 00:41:49,360
was talking about how the adoption of cross-platform,

675
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:50,521
the way we're able to.

676
00:41:52,201 --> 00:41:56,542
Fortnite is pioneering some of this, especially on the various platforms.

677
00:41:56,562 --> 00:42:02,084
So cross-play between all of these various platforms, I think that is a real breakthrough

678
00:42:02,484 --> 00:42:05,585
that will then just add more adoption into this type of space.

679
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:06,965
So if somebody is...

680
00:42:08,345 --> 00:42:10,046
If you go to the void and you...

681
00:42:10,652 --> 00:42:14,274
You go through the experience and there's something that you can take away from that

682
00:42:14,334 --> 00:42:16,976
and it's on your mobile phone and it drives the engagement.

683
00:42:17,016 --> 00:42:23,560
You're configuring whatever, your blaster or your lightsaber or something else and then

684
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,562
you're the social aspect of that.

685
00:42:25,902 --> 00:42:27,063
Now I'm sharing it with you.

686
00:42:27,543 --> 00:42:30,745
We're texting pictures back and forth or we're in the same...

687
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:36,397
I don't know if there's a subset platform from the void, but it's the takeaways that

688
00:42:36,457 --> 00:42:37,437
drives the engagement.

689
00:42:37,477 --> 00:42:43,658
And then you're going back into maybe you're at home on your PSVR and you put your headset

690
00:42:43,778 --> 00:42:47,299
on and you're able to configure your character that way as well.

691
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:54,201
So I think all of those technologies kind of converging together in a way that drives

692
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:59,142
better cross-platform support for the individual experience.

693
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:09,352
is, in the long term, I think it's just going to help the void and those types of hyperreality

694
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:12,736
experiences mature a lot faster.

695
00:43:13,931 --> 00:43:17,794
One of the things I was just going to say is we have some interesting statistics so

696
00:43:17,854 --> 00:43:20,116
far from The Void.

697
00:43:20,156 --> 00:43:28,384
And it's basically, as I said, people are lining up for surveys, and we found that 25

698
00:43:28,704 --> 00:43:30,966
percent have no experience at all with VR.

699
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,747
It's the first time they've even heard about it.

700
00:43:32,787 --> 00:43:35,089
They didn't know what it was in any form.

701
00:43:36,811 --> 00:43:42,416
Another 25% have very little experience, like they might have heard about it, but they might not have experienced it.

702
00:43:43,577 --> 00:43:49,162
Then 31% have some experience, and that some experience often is cardboard, or they walk by,

703
00:43:49,602 --> 00:43:53,185
you know, one of the Best Buy demos, or an airport demo, or something like that. And then

704
00:43:53,225 --> 00:43:54,506
19% have a lot of experience.

705
00:43:56,988 --> 00:44:00,469
So in some ways, for me, the numbers in terms of people

706
00:44:00,509 --> 00:44:03,310
being exposed to it were a little higher than I had

707
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,351
originally anticipated.

708
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:07,131
I thought it might be like 80% didn't know anything and

709
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,712
maybe 20% and it broke down further.

710
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:13,233
So I think more and more people, I mean it's

711
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:18,575
It's blooming faster than we might have anticipated,

712
00:44:19,235 --> 00:44:20,856
but we still have a ways to go.

713
00:44:20,916 --> 00:44:23,877
And I think The Void is a great way that's

714
00:44:23,977 --> 00:44:26,759
allowing people to enter this world for the first time

715
00:44:27,379 --> 00:44:32,221
and hopefully then take it on broader experiences.

716
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:37,484
Well, I will tell you, from my experience, going to the mall to basically go to this

717
00:44:37,544 --> 00:44:41,827
new opening at Glendale Galleria reminded me of when I was eight years old and couldn't

718
00:44:42,008 --> 00:44:47,673
wait to get to the Gold Mine, which was an arcade that I used to go to and just obsessed

719
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:51,937
over because that's where the magic was, that's where the new cutting edge was, the technology.

720
00:44:52,337 --> 00:44:57,722
I had that same experience as a grown man going to Secrets of the Empire, and I couldn't

721
00:44:57,762 --> 00:44:58,583
wait to go back.

722
00:44:59,003 --> 00:45:01,645
and see everything that I missed, because I knew there was so much.

723
00:45:01,925 --> 00:45:03,206
And all I could think of was stop...

724
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:07,950
I couldn't stop myself from obsessively thinking about where it's going to go,

725
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:12,034
what's next, and everything that I suddenly had to look forward to

726
00:45:12,054 --> 00:45:13,875
that I didn't even know I had to look forward to.

727
00:45:14,856 --> 00:45:17,278
I could sit here and ask you guys questions all morning,

728
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:20,861
but we have a room full of people that I'm sure have their own questions,

729
00:45:20,881 --> 00:45:23,383
so I wanted to open it up to the room for questions.

730
00:45:23,423 --> 00:45:26,385
We have time to answer if any of you have questions for our panelists.

731
00:45:28,223 --> 00:45:29,625
There's a mic here and a mic right there.

732
00:45:29,845 --> 00:45:31,726
While someone's walking up, I'm going to give you guys one

733
00:45:31,766 --> 00:45:35,549
statistic that has been fascinating for us and not

734
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:36,830
necessarily what we expected.

735
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:41,474
We opened in the Westfield, London, and that mall.

736
00:45:41,654 --> 00:45:43,515
And we thought we were going to get a lot of foot traffic

737
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:45,657
from the mall, which we are getting for sure.

738
00:45:46,117 --> 00:45:49,800
But let me see.

739
00:45:50,181 --> 00:45:52,322
71.6% of the people coming to the Westfield Mall, London,

740
00:45:52,602 --> 00:45:54,404
it's their first time going to that mall.

741
00:45:54,444 --> 00:45:56,045
And the reason they came is because of the void.

742
00:45:57,386 --> 00:45:57,666
Wow.

743
00:45:59,748 --> 00:46:06,313
Yeah, I've done both the Ghostbusters in New York experience and did the Anaheim one at

744
00:46:06,454 --> 00:46:08,215
Downtown Disney when that opened up for Star Wars.

745
00:46:08,255 --> 00:46:12,358
So both amazing and love the hyper-reality with the various effects.

746
00:46:12,818 --> 00:46:14,300
I guess the question is, I want to do more.

747
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:16,161
So is there like a sequel coming out?

748
00:46:16,261 --> 00:46:19,924
Or I don't know if you can say anything, but I guess I can continue to do Secrets of the

749
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:21,065
Empire again and again and again.

750
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,066
But just curious, like, what's next?

751
00:46:24,592 --> 00:46:27,176
Well, we haven't announced our slate yet, but we will be

752
00:46:27,196 --> 00:46:28,077
announcing the slate.

753
00:46:28,678 --> 00:46:30,941
And there's definitely more to come, for sure.

754
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:34,105
And there are more locations to come in lots of places.

755
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:36,648
So you won't necessarily have to go to New York, only New

756
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,590
York or Los Angeles.

757
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:38,531
Hopefully, there'll be something

758
00:46:38,571 --> 00:46:39,773
closer for you as well.

759
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:45,391
I just want to say great work, got a chance to go through the experience in Orlando.

760
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,772
You know, really fantastic.

761
00:46:46,852 --> 00:46:51,537
A lot of great milestones being overcome, so great job.

762
00:46:52,377 --> 00:46:57,242
But I'm curious about, first it was the Ghostbusters and now it's Star Wars.

763
00:46:57,642 --> 00:47:02,847
What challenges do you see of authoring theme worlds outside of established and well-known theme worlds?

764
00:47:03,688 --> 00:47:07,071
Well, you know, this is a journey that we're all on together.

765
00:47:07,231 --> 00:47:08,692
We're all experienced.

766
00:47:08,973 --> 00:47:09,533
Nobody knows.

767
00:47:10,574 --> 00:47:13,816
We just keep putting our feet out there and experiencing.

768
00:47:13,836 --> 00:47:16,218
We are going to be, and I can't announce the title,

769
00:47:16,238 --> 00:47:20,341
but I can say we are going to be introducing an original IP

770
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:24,004
into the marketplace in the next few months.

771
00:47:24,825 --> 00:47:27,747
And as we do that, it's going to be a lot of learning.

772
00:47:27,787 --> 00:47:30,789
What is it like to introduce an original piece of IP that

773
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:33,971
doesn't have a $100 million ad campaign behind it, where

774
00:47:33,991 --> 00:47:35,572
we're trying to get people to know about it?

775
00:47:35,813 --> 00:47:40,716
And we're still a startup, so we don't have $100 million to

776
00:47:40,736 --> 00:47:41,677
put into advertising.

777
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:43,818
So stay tuned.

778
00:47:43,878 --> 00:47:45,760
We're all learning together, and we'll find out, because

779
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,601
we're going to be introducing that.

780
00:47:48,081 --> 00:47:49,562
That's the next piece that will be coming out.

781
00:47:52,723 --> 00:47:53,923
Hey, this sounds awesome.

782
00:47:53,943 --> 00:47:57,185
I haven't experienced it myself, but I'm a chief engineer and it sounds like something

783
00:47:57,225 --> 00:47:58,946
even I would pay for, so that sounds great.

784
00:48:00,426 --> 00:48:05,549
I'm curious about, right now it sounds like it's very niche and kind of a high-end experience,

785
00:48:05,569 --> 00:48:06,389
very customized.

786
00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:11,813
It seems to me like we have the tools and capabilities where it could theoretically

787
00:48:12,693 --> 00:48:18,137
trickle down where someone with moderate computer experience would be able to do something like what Noel was talking about,

788
00:48:18,177 --> 00:48:21,899
take a picture of your house and then build an experience in your own home,

789
00:48:21,939 --> 00:48:24,421
like a fun house or a haunted house where people could come in.

790
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:27,983
I'm just curious what your guys' thoughts are on the path to that,

791
00:48:29,304 --> 00:48:33,567
how long would that take and some tools that might be in place to start doing that on our own.

792
00:48:34,762 --> 00:48:37,622
I think that will happen fairly quickly.

793
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:39,903
I mean, I think that if you really

794
00:48:40,403 --> 00:48:42,483
wanted to do that just with a tethered headset,

795
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:43,343
you could do that now.

796
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,904
It's just the length of your cable

797
00:48:45,944 --> 00:48:47,964
will sort of limit how far you can walk.

798
00:48:48,544 --> 00:48:52,425
But I think as you get into untethered VR headsets,

799
00:48:52,685 --> 00:48:55,206
and certainly also like mixed reality headsets

800
00:48:56,226 --> 00:48:58,746
meant for the home, I think that'll happen very quickly.

801
00:48:59,727 --> 00:49:04,854
They rely on effectively inside-out tracking SLAM algorithms

802
00:49:04,894 --> 00:49:07,578
that create a point cloud of things around you.

803
00:49:07,598 --> 00:49:11,924
It becomes a question of whether that's exposed to you necessarily immediately or not.

804
00:49:12,044 --> 00:49:14,867
But even if it's not, I think you'll...

805
00:49:16,136 --> 00:49:20,599
You'll have the tools, I mean, in particular people in this industry have the tools very

806
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:26,423
quickly to make a map of the real environment and then in a game engine build a world that

807
00:49:26,483 --> 00:49:29,285
matches that and just calibrate your position to that.

808
00:49:29,345 --> 00:49:33,267
And I think you'll very quickly be able to sort of experiment with that.

809
00:49:33,647 --> 00:49:40,552
And if those types of headsets become successful, I think, in particular like mixed reality

810
00:49:40,592 --> 00:49:40,912
headsets.

811
00:49:42,213 --> 00:49:45,816
very, very quickly have to rely on the idea of having

812
00:49:45,856 --> 00:49:48,118
a map of the world around you.

813
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:51,140
You want to be able to put a virtual object on a table,

814
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,881
so it has to know there's a table there.

815
00:49:53,402 --> 00:49:58,626
And so I think we're talking a matter of two, three years

816
00:49:58,666 --> 00:50:00,587
where you'll be able to do some of these things.

817
00:50:01,476 --> 00:50:07,158
And the tool set too, for Epic Games, anybody can go download Unreal Engine.

818
00:50:08,578 --> 00:50:12,699
It doesn't take much computer power to actually run the engine itself.

819
00:50:13,919 --> 00:50:15,520
There's a lot of construction tools in there.

820
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,900
You can build some of these experiences.

821
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:25,623
I think the one key piece that you would need to actually just look at VR, it would be the

822
00:50:25,643 --> 00:50:30,604
headset whether it's Oculus or Vive or something along those lines.

823
00:50:33,144 --> 00:50:34,645
My kids are doing it at home.

824
00:50:34,925 --> 00:50:38,707
They're building their room and then being able to dress it up the way that they want to.

825
00:50:38,727 --> 00:50:44,150
So it's not too far that you'll be able to have objects and placement and multiplayers.

826
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:50,874
I think user-generated content is such a big part of culture now.

827
00:50:50,954 --> 00:51:00,940
I think naturally the market will drive experiences that allow people to participate in the world creation, in the storytelling.

828
00:51:02,925 --> 00:51:09,448
Thanks. One other thing that struck me was when you're talking about the memories that people were having of these things that you know are virtual,

829
00:51:09,989 --> 00:51:15,672
is have you looked into educational experiences where you could really bring someone into some historical events

830
00:51:16,032 --> 00:51:19,654
and really have it strike a student that would stick with them much better than just reading the book?

831
00:51:20,354 --> 00:51:24,116
Yes, it's absolutely. Educational is definitely on our roadmap.

832
00:51:25,905 --> 00:51:27,866
Some of the stuff you guys are doing is super, super cool.

833
00:51:28,046 --> 00:51:31,707
One thing I'm really curious about is how often do you guys have repeat, like, visitors

834
00:51:31,747 --> 00:51:32,627
to some of your centers?

835
00:51:32,947 --> 00:51:33,827
Is that a common thing?

836
00:51:35,828 --> 00:51:38,728
We do have repeat and we are learning more about our repeat.

837
00:51:38,868 --> 00:51:43,289
You know, most recently in Glendale, we've only been open since Friday and we already

838
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:48,431
have a 10% repeat rate, which is surprising for us.

839
00:51:48,931 --> 00:51:51,171
So people are coming back and we hope they do.

840
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:54,852
Have those kind of people kind of mentioned what brings them back?

841
00:51:56,969 --> 00:52:01,814
I think a lot of it is people experience something and then they want to experience it with other

842
00:52:01,874 --> 00:52:05,158
friends or they want to bring their brother or they want to bring their sister or, you

843
00:52:05,178 --> 00:52:11,565
know, I went through with my 83-year-old mom who held on to me the whole time and...

844
00:52:11,726 --> 00:52:12,867
Stormtroopers holding hands.

845
00:52:13,007 --> 00:52:13,307
Again.

846
00:52:13,828 --> 00:52:14,048
Yep.

847
00:52:14,369 --> 00:52:14,989
It's happening.

848
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:15,870
Go ahead.

849
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:18,171
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.

850
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:21,232
No, so I was just going to say, and the first thing she wanted to do was, okay, now that

851
00:52:21,272 --> 00:52:26,234
I've been so overwhelmed, I want to do it again now to start to find other things.

852
00:52:26,674 --> 00:52:27,795
So I think it's both those.

853
00:52:28,075 --> 00:52:29,375
But go ahead, Judah, you have some more.

854
00:52:29,655 --> 00:52:34,997
I just think the medium is so transformative, and it's not something that you can watch

855
00:52:35,017 --> 00:52:39,639
a commercial or a TV show or see an ad, and you just don't understand it when you see

856
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:40,479
it on a flat screen.

857
00:52:40,499 --> 00:52:43,861
So it's not until you put the headset on and you actually go into it.

858
00:52:44,941 --> 00:52:52,026
And especially with the void because it's tactile so you're touching things you're smelling the the ash in the air

859
00:52:53,767 --> 00:52:56,789
I think that is when people put that on it's it's so

860
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:02,153
In your face groundbreaking you can't help but say I've got to try this again

861
00:53:02,393 --> 00:53:04,815
It was that the way I really remembered it like

862
00:53:05,535 --> 00:53:06,055
from yesterday.

863
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:10,996
But I think also as audiences become more sophisticated,

864
00:53:11,376 --> 00:53:16,737
that first wow effect, that'll over the next couple of years

865
00:53:16,797 --> 00:53:18,578
I think will start wearing off.

866
00:53:18,618 --> 00:53:21,778
You can't rely on that anymore being the thing that

867
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:22,519
makes it amazing.

868
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,019
And so I think as we design future experiences,

869
00:53:25,419 --> 00:53:27,120
we really have to think about that.

870
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,360
What makes it rewarding to come back?

871
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,121
How can we make sure that when you come back,

872
00:53:32,161 --> 00:53:34,201
you actually have a different experience that

873
00:53:34,261 --> 00:53:35,422
is just as rewarding?

874
00:53:35,882 --> 00:53:36,602
Yeah, absolutely.

875
00:53:36,803 --> 00:53:40,626
No, we've got to continue to raise the bar each step of the way.

876
00:53:41,006 --> 00:53:46,170
I look at visual effects, for example, even looking at things like the original Star Wars

877
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:51,794
or looking at Titanic or any of these groundbreaking films.

878
00:53:51,814 --> 00:53:57,959
When you look back at them, the general audience now can see, like, oh, that doesn't look real

879
00:53:58,019 --> 00:53:58,379
anymore.

880
00:53:58,439 --> 00:53:59,640
But when they first saw it, it looks real.

881
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,761
And we're going to have the same thing in VR.

882
00:54:04,004 --> 00:54:08,013
Hi. Huge Star Wars fan. Been seeing David around for a year, so it's cool to see you here.

883
00:54:10,048 --> 00:54:14,130
One of my questions is, so one of the issues here is footprint, right?

884
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:18,213
The amount of space that it takes to do these experiences and how customized those things are.

885
00:54:18,613 --> 00:54:25,057
Have you considered just kind of fooling the user into going back through certain areas and reskinning them

886
00:54:25,177 --> 00:54:30,300
or even reskinning the entire experience for other kind of IP, you know?

887
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,083
Like being able to reuse the space in ways that could...

888
00:54:35,175 --> 00:54:55,806
We've absolutely I mean part the only thing that makes it possible to scale which you know one of the things about the void is it's also a place where we're starting to see a business model that might that makes sense or hopefully will make sense and so so the only way to do that is to scale a business and the only way to scale a business in real terms is to start to come to some sort of standardization so

889
00:54:56,547 --> 00:55:02,788
The footprint of the void, you know, is now basically the layout of our, what we call our stages, is basically solidified.

890
00:55:03,228 --> 00:55:06,969
And now what we're doing is exactly what you suggest, and you're right on the right track,

891
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:11,150
is how do we re-skin our experiences and make them unique and exciting every time.

892
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:16,532
It's the balance between how do we do that and also make something scalable that makes sense in a business world.

893
00:55:16,752 --> 00:55:18,692
Yeah, the challenge of reusing without having it feel...

894
00:55:19,522 --> 00:55:21,403
feel like it's being used. Yes, exactly.

895
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:21,683
Thanks.

896
00:55:21,803 --> 00:55:26,084
If I can say one thing there too, because with Secrets of the Empire,

897
00:55:26,124 --> 00:55:28,885
I don't have you. Have you done the experience or gone through it?

898
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:31,986
So it kills me because I just moved from Orlando to New York

899
00:55:32,026 --> 00:55:35,127
and I moved to New York after they opened the Orlando experience.

900
00:55:35,147 --> 00:55:37,408
So I got to do the Ghostbusters one.

901
00:55:37,448 --> 00:55:39,328
I have not been able to do the Star Wars one.

902
00:55:39,529 --> 00:55:43,572
So it's good that you were able to do the Ghostbusters one because it kind of helps

903
00:55:43,793 --> 00:55:44,393
get an idea.

904
00:55:45,514 --> 00:55:49,038
Raising the bar, one of the things that we really tried to do on this, we wanted to lengthen

905
00:55:49,058 --> 00:55:49,758
the experience.

906
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:53,802
It was going from 8 or so minutes to like 11 or 12 minutes.

907
00:55:54,683 --> 00:56:00,028
So we had to reuse the space, the physical space, the actual stage itself, two or three

908
00:56:00,068 --> 00:56:00,488
times.

909
00:56:01,129 --> 00:56:02,070
So we get...

910
00:56:03,252 --> 00:56:05,473
I don't know if I'm giving away too much here, so stop me.

911
00:56:05,513 --> 00:56:09,194
But four groups of four going through the experience at any given time,

912
00:56:09,254 --> 00:56:10,695
having their own original experience,

913
00:56:11,255 --> 00:56:15,677
as you wrap around and come back and you have the, uh...

914
00:56:15,717 --> 00:56:16,278
Spoiler alert.

915
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:18,739
Have the end battle...

916
00:56:20,302 --> 00:56:21,683
at the very end, I'll just leave it at that.

917
00:56:23,943 --> 00:56:26,844
You're actually going through a space that you were just in

918
00:56:27,644 --> 00:56:31,104
five minutes prior to on a skiff going into the vault.

919
00:56:31,124 --> 00:56:34,565
So we're reusing and trying to lengthen the experience.

920
00:56:36,085 --> 00:56:37,906
And in the most basic sense, you know,

921
00:56:37,926 --> 00:56:40,086
it's even doing that in Ghostbusters where you're in a hallway,

922
00:56:40,126 --> 00:56:42,707
you get into an elevator, you go up five floors, you get back out.

923
00:56:42,887 --> 00:56:44,327
You're still in the same hallway.

924
00:56:44,427 --> 00:56:45,147
I peaked, so.

925
00:56:49,382 --> 00:56:53,825
It just, yeah, I mean the parallel to game design, I mean level designers have to do this as well.

926
00:56:54,045 --> 00:56:57,928
You know, reuse, clever reuse of space, reuse of assets, but you have no idea.

927
00:56:59,689 --> 00:57:00,970
Just really, really fast and...

928
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:03,071
Oh, actually we have more people. Oh, let's ask more.

929
00:57:03,672 --> 00:57:09,416
There's a, that scene near the end where there's a certain villain character that appears which...

930
00:57:09,736 --> 00:57:11,738
It gave me palpitations while I was doing that.

931
00:57:11,778 --> 00:57:13,219
I'm starting to relive that now.

932
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,924
It becomes a very strong memory more than, say, watching it in a film.

933
00:57:17,944 --> 00:57:21,747
So what you're saying to the fact that this imprints in your memory more

934
00:57:21,767 --> 00:57:26,551
out of actually experiencing it than watching it on a film is totally true.

935
00:57:27,833 --> 00:57:31,896
Also the fact that smell is introduced really helps transport you there too.

936
00:57:33,435 --> 00:57:37,941
How do you figure out which smells, or are there certain smells that are more attuned to it?

937
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:39,863
I smell burnt stuff in that.

938
00:57:39,883 --> 00:57:41,245
Was that all of them, or were there more?

939
00:57:41,265 --> 00:57:42,447
Did I miss anything?

940
00:57:42,687 --> 00:57:47,213
Oh, and the other thing that affects repeatability is points, like having a score.

941
00:57:47,493 --> 00:57:48,835
For Ghostbusters, there was a score.

942
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:50,777
Was there a score for Star Wars?

943
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:52,458
Because I would definitely do it again,

944
00:57:52,478 --> 00:57:54,539
because I think I totally messed up the first time.

945
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:57,400
We intentionally did not want to do that,

946
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,561
because we wanted to keep this more of a story

947
00:58:00,841 --> 00:58:01,661
type of experience.

948
00:58:01,701 --> 00:58:05,123
So we intentionally kept the scoring in any.

949
00:58:06,885 --> 00:58:09,447
Anything that would kind of lend towards more gamified type

950
00:58:09,487 --> 00:58:11,268
of experience, we kind of pulled back on that.

951
00:58:11,628 --> 00:58:14,811
However, we've had enough, and Judah doesn't know this yet

952
00:58:14,831 --> 00:58:17,693
because he's over, he's in Africa,

953
00:58:18,353 --> 00:58:22,236
but we've had so much request, that very question

954
00:58:22,276 --> 00:58:25,719
that we are, while it's not necessarily a game,

955
00:58:26,299 --> 00:58:29,362
like a game score exactly, and how many hits,

956
00:58:29,442 --> 00:58:31,103
and where are the hits, and different points,

957
00:58:31,123 --> 00:58:34,505
there is something that's going to be introduced

958
00:58:34,585 --> 00:58:35,326
that has that.

959
00:58:36,288 --> 00:58:39,281
A component like that coming in the next couple months.

960
00:58:39,637 --> 00:58:41,758
We have 30 seconds left, so last question here.

961
00:58:41,778 --> 00:58:44,739
And then I understand you are going to be available for

962
00:58:44,779 --> 00:58:45,540
questions afterwards.

963
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,781
Yeah, we'll go to wherever the wrap up area is.

964
00:58:48,481 --> 00:58:49,622
So just a quick question.

965
00:58:49,662 --> 00:58:54,224
So it's a great work to bring all the physical feelings into

966
00:58:54,344 --> 00:58:59,107
the experience, like the touch and the heat and rain, those

967
00:58:59,127 --> 00:59:02,128
things, have you thinking about bringing real world

968
00:59:02,208 --> 00:59:03,889
experience into this experience?

969
00:59:03,949 --> 00:59:05,230
Like your cell phone?

970
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:08,051
Go to the link on the left-hand side when you get the demo.

971
00:59:08,251 --> 00:59:08,411
Please.

972
00:59:08,431 --> 00:59:09,211
And that was Frazer.

973
00:59:09,331 --> 00:59:09,812
And that's you.

974
00:59:09,832 --> 00:59:11,592
So it would take a little, it would take a few minute.

975
00:59:11,612 --> 00:59:14,213
So and that is how we got to where we are today.

976
00:59:14,393 --> 00:59:17,374
And on that note I'm going to take the floor and hand it back to my questions to the panel

977
00:59:17,414 --> 00:59:18,135
and Chris to conclude.

978
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:21,036
So you can put your question in emergency management, and I ask you to please do that.

979
00:59:21,056 --> 00:59:21,496
Thank you so much.

980
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:28,178
I know you had to do some in headset, and some other types of people being able to bring

981
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:31,379
the experience with them, so that technology is being worked on now.

982
00:59:31,399 --> 00:59:32,980
Thank you all very much for coming.

983
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,180
Please give a round of applause to our panelists.

984
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:34,320
Thanks.

985
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:35,261
And thanks to our test participants every week.

986
00:59:35,281 --> 00:59:35,641
Okay next question.

987
00:59:36,847 --> 00:59:37,842
Thank you and have a great day.
