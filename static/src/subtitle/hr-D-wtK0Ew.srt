1
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:14,065
So my name is Barney Pratt.

2
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:16,806
I am Senior Audio Director at Supermassive Games.

3
00:00:16,846 --> 00:00:18,826
Been there for 14 years, a long time.

4
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:22,707
I've helped build a lot of the audio systems with a lot of help from different people over

5
00:00:22,747 --> 00:00:25,068
time that we're going to be looking at today.

6
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:31,150
And it's that kind of cinematic audio DNA that makes Supermassive special and we're

7
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,250
expanding on it all the time.

8
00:00:32,994 --> 00:00:35,776
And this talk will focus on just some of the systems

9
00:00:35,856 --> 00:00:37,478
within that kind of cinematic DNA

10
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,301
that have enabled us to release annual AAA content

11
00:00:41,422 --> 00:00:42,543
for the Dark Pictures.

12
00:00:43,564 --> 00:00:45,526
And as you will see, a lot of these systems

13
00:00:45,586 --> 00:00:48,368
have as much a place in the open world as they do in.

14
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:49,950
cinematic games.

15
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:54,774
Everything I'm presenting today wouldn't be possible without a great team.

16
00:00:55,214 --> 00:00:57,836
We are 18 sound designers, it's huge at the moment,

17
00:00:58,156 --> 00:01:00,377
plus a production manager to help us organize,

18
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:03,959
with an added composer, Jason Graves,

19
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:06,741
who we're lucky to have in the audience today.

20
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:08,803
So any music questions later,

21
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:10,944
maybe point them in his direction more than mine,

22
00:01:11,564 --> 00:01:12,405
but we can share them, it's fine.

23
00:01:13,966 --> 00:01:15,927
So, yeah, it's an ever-evolving team.

24
00:01:17,657 --> 00:01:22,821
Quick word about Supermassive Games, we're a BAFTA-winning studio founded in 2008.

25
00:01:22,861 --> 00:01:26,084
350-plus individuals, so we're pretty big now.

26
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:27,765
We're based in Guildford, UK.

27
00:01:28,245 --> 00:01:31,488
We've had critical acclaim for both cinematic and VR,

28
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,650
multi-platform, multi-format,

29
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,872
and we support a lot of UK charities, including Games Aid.

30
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:41,756
We've been lucky enough to receive a bunch of nominations and awards,

31
00:01:41,997 --> 00:01:43,077
including Audio Tech,

32
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,500
and a lot of good critical acclaim for Audio Over Time.

33
00:01:47,454 --> 00:01:50,676
Standouts were BAFTA for Best Original IP

34
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:55,719
and a NAVGTR for the second in the Dark Pictures anthology series

35
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:57,680
for Best Audio in a Game Cinematic.

36
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:00,702
And we'll see why this award was so amazing,

37
00:02:00,762 --> 00:02:02,863
because a lot of the sound that we were being judged on there

38
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:04,584
was systemic sound, was procedural.

39
00:02:05,424 --> 00:02:07,265
So it's a huge compliment to those systems.

40
00:02:08,306 --> 00:02:10,527
And also, we're up for three Gang Awards in about an hour.

41
00:02:11,388 --> 00:02:12,708
So, fingers crossed.

42
00:02:15,972 --> 00:02:20,941
Sorry about that. I just figured 530 on a Thursday, everyone's going to need a little

43
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:26,732
pep call. So yeah, there you go. And the vampire will be making an entry later on. You'll be

44
00:02:26,752 --> 00:02:27,493
finding out more about him.

45
00:02:29,705 --> 00:02:31,326
So Dark Pictures Anthology, what is it?

46
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:33,326
It's interactive branching horror,

47
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:36,147
wildly different narratives and locations,

48
00:02:36,187 --> 00:02:37,167
et cetera, between each game.

49
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,728
There's a lot of exploration gameplay

50
00:02:39,768 --> 00:02:40,849
as well as the cinematic.

51
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,909
There's single, two, multiplayer,

52
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,750
online, offline, couch co-op,

53
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,091
and eight plus, sorry, eight games in total

54
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:50,871
for the anthology.

55
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:53,252
Season one is made of the first four.

56
00:02:54,152 --> 00:02:55,733
There's Man of Medan, Little Hope,

57
00:02:56,313 --> 00:02:57,893
House of Ashes, and The Devil in Me.

58
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,453
During these four years, we were also doing several other things.

59
00:03:02,494 --> 00:03:05,155
We onboarded an outsource audio team for the Quarry,

60
00:03:06,176 --> 00:03:07,457
and they did an amazing job.

61
00:03:07,497 --> 00:03:11,359
That's Adele from Sound Cuts, who might be here, but maybe not.

62
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,981
If you haven't checked out, Quarry's got a fantastic soundtrack as well.

63
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:16,402
We're working on some unannounced projects.

64
00:03:17,142 --> 00:03:21,045
And last week, we released a launch title for the PSVR2,

65
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:22,886
called Switchback VR.

66
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:25,548
But we are not here to talk about those.

67
00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:28,810
We're here to talk about the first for the Season 1.

68
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,691
of the dark pictures.

69
00:03:31,572 --> 00:03:33,093
Quick talk overview, we're gonna look at

70
00:03:33,574 --> 00:03:35,075
branching narrative design just briefly

71
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:36,597
to kind of illustrate the challenges we have.

72
00:03:37,398 --> 00:03:39,680
We'll look at procedural foley and character sound.

73
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,122
These are like really key systems

74
00:03:41,282 --> 00:03:43,484
for achieving the kind of cinematic characters.

75
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:47,717
We'll look at how they extend or bleed into Creature Foley,

76
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,039
and we'll look at how we worldize sound, some of the attenuations,

77
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,881
and we'll look at the interactive mix,

78
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:55,002
how we balance out all the sounds playing in the game.

79
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:57,484
We'll also look at two unique systems.

80
00:03:57,724 --> 00:04:00,566
One is an in-game runtime directional microphone,

81
00:04:00,986 --> 00:04:05,149
which was a gift to the sound team in the fourth of the Dark Pictures,

82
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:09,492
and we'll also look at diegetic music, how we start it diegetically

83
00:04:09,512 --> 00:04:12,274
and then bleed it out to be full score for added drama.

84
00:04:14,091 --> 00:04:17,934
So what I mean by branching narrative, I think everyone here is probably quite familiar with that concept now.

85
00:04:18,535 --> 00:04:20,937
It's player agency to direct their narrative.

86
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,921
Here's a kind of illustration of some of the logic flows that we have.

87
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:31,247
Quick overview, these green sections are sequenced sections, Unreal Sequencer,

88
00:04:32,287 --> 00:04:38,113
which are essentially short linear sequences, all in-game sequences, not FMVs, not videos.

89
00:04:38,593 --> 00:04:40,135
So not the kind of standard cutscene stuff.

90
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:44,821
And then there are interactive sections highlighted here in red.

91
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:48,763
These could be anything from a narrative choice,

92
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:52,925
dilemma choice, combat choice, QTE, quick time event, sorry.

93
00:04:53,145 --> 00:04:55,587
It's basically anything that leads to branching.

94
00:04:57,788 --> 00:05:02,590
And then we have a bunch of exploration gameplay to consider as well.

95
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:06,633
This is not truly representative of how it looks in the logic flow,

96
00:05:06,693 --> 00:05:08,974
but it's good enough for this talk.

97
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:12,808
So take a closer look at what's contained

98
00:05:12,868 --> 00:05:14,688
in a single linear node or sequence.

99
00:05:15,369 --> 00:05:18,369
These contain dialogue events, sound effect spots.

100
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,770
We also draw in RTPC curves,

101
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,531
it's all the standard Unreal Sequencer stuff.

102
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:25,652
And the RTPC curves come in with the music later.

103
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:29,233
We also add an additional layer of linear Foley

104
00:05:29,273 --> 00:05:32,694
per character, which is recorded as you would do to film.

105
00:05:33,214 --> 00:05:34,334
There's no adaptation there

106
00:05:34,354 --> 00:05:35,575
in terms of the recording technique,

107
00:05:35,855 --> 00:05:37,455
but it really is just a minimal addition

108
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:38,675
to some of the systems.

109
00:05:38,735 --> 00:05:40,116
It's anything we don't have systems for.

110
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:45,122
like a chair move, a wall scrape from a character,

111
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:47,923
rope holding, doors, body falls,

112
00:05:48,143 --> 00:05:49,703
and some added cloth for crawls.

113
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:53,845
And then across all of the sequences,

114
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:56,125
the interactive sections and the exploration

115
00:05:56,345 --> 00:05:57,566
is the systemic audio.

116
00:05:58,546 --> 00:06:00,366
It's the same systems throughout all

117
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:01,807
of the gameplay aspects.

118
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:04,488
These include character breath system,

119
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:07,228
exertion of fear, responding to some of the game AI calls,

120
00:06:08,109 --> 00:06:09,209
or yeah, most 2D and 3D.

121
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:13,007
and all the music and sound design.

122
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:17,890
And by using systemic audio throughout all the gameplay areas,

123
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,672
this leads to a seamless experience.

124
00:06:20,212 --> 00:06:23,174
And in fact, seamless gameplay experience,

125
00:06:23,594 --> 00:06:25,415
it maintains the immersion for the players.

126
00:06:25,475 --> 00:06:26,956
It's kind of crucial for the games.

127
00:06:29,251 --> 00:06:32,352
And this systemic audio includes procedural Foley.

128
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:34,713
So all of our character Foley systems, cloth, footsteps,

129
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:38,174
acutes, it's all movement based and it's fully systemic.

130
00:06:38,214 --> 00:06:39,775
We invest really heavily in these systems,

131
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:42,216
incrementally updating them all the time.

132
00:06:42,536 --> 00:06:45,317
And this gives us consistency throughout the sequences

133
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:47,998
and exploration for character sounds.

134
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,839
We also rely on them to finish the product

135
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,960
because we're doing a one year turnaround.

136
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,461
And that gets a little bit tough towards the end

137
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:56,341
if there's any edits.

138
00:06:57,245 --> 00:07:00,167
So yeah, we've had some huge advancements in this area.

139
00:07:00,828 --> 00:07:04,751
So our aim is to deliver cinematic audio experiences

140
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:06,652
through systemic audio.

141
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,355
And this is going back to the award we won

142
00:07:10,536 --> 00:07:11,957
against other games that we're using

143
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:15,159
kind of linear cutscene pipelines, video playback.

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,581
It's not a take from their excellence

145
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:20,464
because there was some big games that we were up against,

146
00:07:20,844 --> 00:07:22,826
but it's obviously a huge compliment to the systems

147
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:23,967
that we're gonna look at today.

148
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:28,350
Which brings us neatly onto the first system procedural, Foley.

149
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,233
Believable characters are key to our games.

150
00:07:32,313 --> 00:07:33,593
We're making cinematic games.

151
00:07:34,714 --> 00:07:36,255
Foley for us is a broad term.

152
00:07:36,295 --> 00:07:38,256
It's essentially any contact the character

153
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:39,677
makes with the environment.

154
00:07:41,718 --> 00:07:43,359
So we're going to use House of Ashes,

155
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:46,321
the third title in the series, to showcase

156
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:48,643
some of the systems, quick back story.

157
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:52,616
It's set at the close of the Iraq War, May 2003.

158
00:07:53,216 --> 00:07:56,177
American special forces are searching for weapons

159
00:07:56,317 --> 00:07:58,078
of mass destruction, we know how that went.

160
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:01,400
In fact, they found a buried Sumerian temple

161
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,242
with unearthly creatures and much horror hilarity ensues.

162
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,965
And a quick shout out to Glenn and the crew

163
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:14,006
at Molinere in London for all their amazing work

164
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:16,768
on the assets that we're gonna be hearing today.

165
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,820
So we systemize as much as possible.

166
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,760
Why do we do this?

167
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,382
We know then that the majority of the Foley is covered.

168
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:29,022
It leads to easier filing, as I said.

169
00:08:29,082 --> 00:08:30,303
It's a one-year dev cycle.

170
00:08:30,723 --> 00:08:32,444
It's a time-money stress saver,

171
00:08:32,584 --> 00:08:34,164
and it's a win for multiple projects.

172
00:08:34,364 --> 00:08:36,305
This is a long-term investment in these systems.

173
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,365
It's also actually essential

174
00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:40,946
for linear and exploration consistency.

175
00:08:41,306 --> 00:08:43,007
We'll look at some gun Foley later,

176
00:08:43,027 --> 00:08:43,687
which is really interesting.

177
00:08:45,185 --> 00:08:47,486
The main systems are footsteps.

178
00:08:48,186 --> 00:08:51,487
We have a walk and run based on character speed,

179
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:52,968
playing back small files.

180
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:57,890
And we have additional subtlety brought in with a walk slow.

181
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,291
So as the characters come to a stop,

182
00:09:00,351 --> 00:09:03,872
they are making really nuanced, subtle sounds all the way

183
00:09:03,892 --> 00:09:04,592
up to their stopping.

184
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:13,918
We've extended the system to be sideways movement scuffs, and we use high-velocity vertical movement on characters to play

185
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:15,600
procedural landing sounds.

186
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:19,784
All of these are surface specific. We have something like

187
00:09:19,804 --> 00:09:24,749
26-30 surfaces per game. And of course we extend this system into creature foots.

188
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:32,154
A similar setup for cloth. Short samples based on bone distance and bone pass of knee and elbow.

189
00:09:33,435 --> 00:09:38,497
And we have acutes, which are the super detailed kind of costume elements. They could be combat

190
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:44,619
belts, jewellery, anything that's a small addition. We don't pass up on any opportunity for added

191
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:46,720
variety and subtlety.

192
00:09:47,858 --> 00:09:49,300
And then there were the more bespoke elements.

193
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,682
Gun Foley was something we did new for House of Ashes,

194
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:56,785
with three sets of samples, all velocity triggered.

195
00:09:57,025 --> 00:09:58,446
They're slow, medium, and fast.

196
00:09:58,507 --> 00:10:00,208
Again, we're trying to get as much subtlety as possible.

197
00:10:01,088 --> 00:10:04,131
And a hand pat system, which I have to admit

198
00:10:04,151 --> 00:10:05,372
is still a bit of a work in progress,

199
00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:08,974
but we've had some success with on, off, and slide.

200
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,077
And of course, the creature wings Foley

201
00:10:13,318 --> 00:10:15,800
is an adaptation of these systems.

202
00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:20,153
This is what the sound emitters look like

203
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:21,694
attached to the character mesh.

204
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:26,197
We have eight emitters, there's head, dialogue, chest,

205
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:30,699
left and right hands, knee, and both feet.

206
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,560
So the emitters are tracked at runtime,

207
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,162
they drive RTPCs and switches in Wwise,

208
00:10:36,703 --> 00:10:39,244
and the idea is we're simulating natural performance.

209
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:42,146
So quick side note,

210
00:10:42,186 --> 00:10:44,307
we switched to spatial audio for House of Ashes.

211
00:10:45,348 --> 00:10:46,808
So all the House of Ashes clips you'll see.

212
00:10:47,554 --> 00:10:50,635
as you'll hear, will be with full spatial audio.

213
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:52,937
And it was an absolutely amazing system

214
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:55,458
and a great project to showcase it on

215
00:10:55,498 --> 00:10:58,040
with huge cavernous spaces, small tunnels,

216
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,601
portaling, et cetera, was just fantastic.

217
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:03,903
But I'm not gonna talk too much about that

218
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:05,704
because it's Wwise out-of-the-box system

219
00:11:05,824 --> 00:11:07,565
and there's a lot of information online.

220
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:11,267
But we did learn something from this.

221
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,409
We have to respect the CPU because

222
00:11:16,354 --> 00:11:19,397
With 8 emitters per character, often multiple characters,

223
00:11:19,437 --> 00:11:21,238
thousands of API calls, you've been there, right?

224
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,643
Often like 50 enemy soldiers, 11 friendlies, 8 vampires.

225
00:11:26,663 --> 00:11:28,324
The vampires actually had 12 emitters each.

226
00:11:29,966 --> 00:11:33,329
All the switches, RTPC values, diffraction values,

227
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:34,690
it was way too much.

228
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,271
So it wasn't the spatial audio that caused it,

229
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,933
but it was definitely part of the equation,

230
00:11:38,053 --> 00:11:39,074
and we pushed it too hard.

231
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:42,597
So, we created a...

232
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:46,274
Well, this brings me onto the next system, really.

233
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:50,015
We created a culling system for events and emitters.

234
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:52,977
And this is a kind of a word of warning.

235
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,798
It's not something everyone thinks of,

236
00:11:55,658 --> 00:11:58,200
but it's based on distance to listener.

237
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,980
This is kind of an illustration from in-game.

238
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:03,322
So outside of their attenuation range,

239
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:05,703
we could firstly cull the events.

240
00:12:06,324 --> 00:12:08,567
in case the emitters were needed later,

241
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:11,410
or then we could be even more hardcore than that.

242
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,591
We could just cull the emitters

243
00:12:12,852 --> 00:12:15,455
and stop any updates being called for them.

244
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:18,939
This was really important during the busy combat scenes

245
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,781
with multiple characters,

246
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:23,885
and also actually led to a less dense mix in some areas.

247
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:24,806
We used it to help us there.

248
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:31,265
And the biggest win and the biggest kind of learning we had from this was make this functionality platform specific

249
00:12:31,785 --> 00:12:36,687
So you can exempt a whole ton of stuff for gen 8 consoles and leave it dense for gen 9

250
00:12:38,308 --> 00:12:39,409
So going back to procedural foley

251
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:47,133
We're gonna look at footsteps first basically anim notifiers are just not a viable option with such a short cycle

252
00:12:48,073 --> 00:12:52,355
And all the loco animations, you know changing being updated all the way towards the end of the project

253
00:12:54,738 --> 00:12:57,000
So we needed a flexible system that would work

254
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,542
with both locomotion and mocap to keep consistency.

255
00:13:01,963 --> 00:13:05,425
And it's motion considerate using various RTPCs.

256
00:13:05,565 --> 00:13:07,246
The core of it is emitter speed.

257
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:11,308
So we extend this, as I said before,

258
00:13:11,388 --> 00:13:13,929
sideways movement scuffs, vertical movement for landings.

259
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,610
And we have an additional layer.

260
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,532
We include overlay detection for sweeteners

261
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:21,774
such as debris or plaster on the floor, maybe a puddle.

262
00:13:24,417 --> 00:13:29,014
And let's take a listen to just the footsteps soloed from in-game.

263
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,853
Okay, moving on to procedural Foley handling.

264
00:14:26,873 --> 00:14:29,936
As I mentioned before, we had a bespoke system

265
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:31,437
for House of Ashes, which was gun Foley.

266
00:14:33,219 --> 00:14:35,422
And we had prop handling for interactions

267
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:36,683
and we had the hand pats.

268
00:14:38,905 --> 00:14:40,027
It's easier if I just play these.

269
00:14:40,187 --> 00:14:42,990
Let's listen to how they play back in game.

270
00:15:43,263 --> 00:15:43,743
Very cool.

271
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:53,191
Moving on to some of the other systems, or furthering this, yeah, into the cloth systems

272
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:54,072
for leg and arm movement.

273
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:58,215
Acutes, again, it's the more subtle close-up stuff.

274
00:15:59,276 --> 00:16:03,640
And we use the same tech for the cloth and acutes system for the creature wings as well.

275
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,582
So let's see how they sound like in-game, soloed.

276
00:17:08,535 --> 00:17:11,356
You see it really fills the soundscape in a very natural way.

277
00:17:12,837 --> 00:17:14,057
Okay, Creature Foley.

278
00:17:15,478 --> 00:17:17,238
Why create procedural foley for a creature?

279
00:17:17,598 --> 00:17:21,260
Well, it gets a lot of screen time.

280
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,521
There's often multiple on the screen, so track lay is not an option.

281
00:17:25,601 --> 00:17:27,162
Thousand plus unique sequences.

282
00:17:28,262 --> 00:17:31,463
So we needed something again that gave us an infinite range of movement.

283
00:17:31,543 --> 00:17:32,663
It was mainly keyframe.

284
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:34,444
There's a little bit of mocap thrown in there as well.

285
00:17:36,315 --> 00:17:40,017
Here's some amazing concept art that we looked at in the early days.

286
00:17:40,437 --> 00:17:43,078
And as I said, the vampire will be making an appearance later.

287
00:17:43,138 --> 00:17:43,959
This is its moment.

288
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,341
Here is a walk cycle example.

289
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:52,022
You can see it's quadruped, not biped, but it can also walk standing up.

290
00:17:53,123 --> 00:17:55,324
Hind legs like a horse with an extra joint.

291
00:17:55,844 --> 00:17:56,665
It has wings.

292
00:17:57,405 --> 00:18:02,647
And of course, many of these features broke the conventions of the human Foley system.

293
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:03,388
So we had to...

294
00:18:04,131 --> 00:18:04,211
of

295
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:04,652
Creature Solo.

296
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,851
Pretty cool.

297
00:19:48,032 --> 00:19:52,256
So let's see how that all combines into the full mix.

298
00:19:52,717 --> 00:19:58,242
And before anybody asks, no, we didn't do the vampire vocals

299
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,463
and clicks procedurally.

300
00:20:00,043 --> 00:20:01,024
We went old school on this.

301
00:20:01,044 --> 00:20:01,725
It was a big job.

302
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:03,546
But it was the only way we thought

303
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:05,588
we were going to really get that believable creature.

304
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,389
So we took the hit.

305
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:08,631
Here it is, full mix, music, everything.

306
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:21,889
Aaaaaaaah!

307
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:23,770
Aaaaaaaah!

308
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:24,411
Aaaaaaaah!

309
00:21:25,111 --> 00:21:43,006
I shoulda went and get the fuck outta here.

310
00:21:43,026 --> 00:21:45,548
I agree.

311
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:48,470
Let's move on to the interactive mix.

312
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:51,524
We have a full runtime mix.

313
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:53,685
It's the same assets for the characters,

314
00:21:53,705 --> 00:21:56,627
especially for exploration and sequenced sections of the game.

315
00:21:57,867 --> 00:21:59,788
It's a sidechain mix, not HDR,

316
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:00,909
although we've been looking at HDR.

317
00:22:02,249 --> 00:22:05,131
We do a lot of work with attenuations to help mix focus.

318
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,751
We have a detachable listener

319
00:22:07,152 --> 00:22:08,512
to help the cinematic needs of the game.

320
00:22:09,253 --> 00:22:12,214
And we do something called 50% center bias panning.

321
00:22:14,263 --> 00:22:15,184
Why do we do all this?

322
00:22:15,324 --> 00:22:17,345
Well, we've got a lot of systems running in the game

323
00:22:17,465 --> 00:22:20,888
and we want a clear, focused, immersive, cinematic mix

324
00:22:21,108 --> 00:22:22,169
of all of those systems.

325
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,532
So when we came to dialogue panning, we had a challenge.

326
00:22:27,092 --> 00:22:29,534
The cameras were cinematic third person,

327
00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:30,474
so lots of camera cuts,

328
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:33,056
often cutting in the middle of a dialogue line.

329
00:22:33,697 --> 00:22:36,639
And our initial approach of full surround panning

330
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,702
led to really harsh jumps in the dialogue there,

331
00:22:40,782 --> 00:22:42,043
both attenuation and panning,

332
00:22:42,063 --> 00:22:43,103
we've switched from side to side.

333
00:22:43,788 --> 00:22:50,332
So we had two options. Option one was the old-school film option of having all dialogue through the center speaker only.

334
00:22:50,512 --> 00:22:54,735
It was safe, but it was lifeless. It just lacked that directionality that game players demand.

335
00:22:55,595 --> 00:23:00,138
Option two of the full kind of 5-1 surround pan had great directionality,

336
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:03,740
but it led to really harsh cuts which broke the player's immersion.

337
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:11,285
So what do we do? We rewrote the panning behavior for character audio, actually for all dialogue and foliage.

338
00:23:12,529 --> 00:23:14,450
And we found a sweet spot between the two options,

339
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,132
allowing panning, but only half of what it should have been.

340
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:22,315
And this was the 50% center bias system.

341
00:23:23,896 --> 00:23:24,637
So how did it work?

342
00:23:24,657 --> 00:23:25,998
Well, with all the character sound

343
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,739
constrained to the front, the LCR,

344
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,920
we would take the character position

345
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,161
relative to the listener as normal,

346
00:23:31,822 --> 00:23:34,984
and play the sound back from a newly calculated position

347
00:23:35,144 --> 00:23:37,265
that had only half the side panning,

348
00:23:37,806 --> 00:23:39,587
thus biasing the center speaker

349
00:23:39,947 --> 00:23:41,828
without constraining exactly to it.

350
00:23:43,292 --> 00:23:46,553
So the example shown here, if a character was off screen right,

351
00:23:47,254 --> 00:23:50,675
rather than their dialogue and Foley panning 100% right as well,

352
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:53,896
they would only pan 50% right.

353
00:23:55,317 --> 00:23:58,558
Again, if the character was 50% right panned, just on the edge of the screen,

354
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:02,939
it would be heard from about 25% right panned, center with center,

355
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,201
and as you can see, it's an elastic value, just proportionate to the in-game

356
00:24:07,741 --> 00:24:09,062
position of the emitter.

357
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:13,748
So it's always playing the majority from the center speaker

358
00:24:13,788 --> 00:24:15,709
when the character emitter is on screen.

359
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:18,352
And we actually did this for all the character sound,

360
00:24:18,812 --> 00:24:21,214
including anything from sequences, body falls, et cetera,

361
00:24:21,635 --> 00:24:22,816
and of course, dialogue.

362
00:24:23,756 --> 00:24:26,179
So it not only removed the uncomfortable audio jumps

363
00:24:26,239 --> 00:24:28,581
on the camera cuts, but it improved the player engagement

364
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:30,823
compared to the sensor-only version,

365
00:24:31,043 --> 00:24:33,645
and led to a smoother, more immersive result.

366
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:34,966
So there's big ticks all around.

367
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:37,388
Attenuations.

368
00:24:39,087 --> 00:24:43,450
We worldize character sound fairly consistently

369
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,230
throughout all the games.

370
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,993
In this example here with the camera listener distant,

371
00:24:48,873 --> 00:24:51,455
you can see the more nuanced foley is not audible,

372
00:24:51,495 --> 00:24:54,156
the cloth, the acutes, and the gun foley.

373
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,758
Footsteps are audible over long distance

374
00:24:56,838 --> 00:24:59,199
to maintain that character presence and believability,

375
00:24:59,239 --> 00:25:00,320
that kind of connection with the world.

376
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,182
And dialogue, of course, is audible everywhere,

377
00:25:03,342 --> 00:25:06,143
never quiet because it's so important to the narrative.

378
00:25:07,805 --> 00:25:10,807
Moving the listener closer, you can now,

379
00:25:11,548 --> 00:25:14,610
sorry, the more nuanced, subtle Foley is now audible.

380
00:25:15,671 --> 00:25:18,833
And this increases that kind of sense of proximity,

381
00:25:18,853 --> 00:25:20,033
that up close and personal,

382
00:25:20,694 --> 00:25:22,735
which you'd expect from a film mix.

383
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:26,418
We can also detach the listener, as I mentioned,

384
00:25:27,098 --> 00:25:28,799
and place it anywhere we like in the world.

385
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,481
Now this gives a really cinematic feel,

386
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:34,503
for example, improving on kind of intimate situations like.

387
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,273
listening to a conversation when you're outside a window,

388
00:25:37,293 --> 00:25:38,534
maybe a cafe or a car.

389
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,296
And we've had these examples come up.

390
00:25:41,397 --> 00:25:43,519
And it also helps us solve occlusion issues

391
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:44,921
with the new spatial audio system

392
00:25:44,981 --> 00:25:47,023
where cameras are placed outside spatial volumes.

393
00:25:51,127 --> 00:25:53,269
And a quick mention of voyeurism

394
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:55,090
with our standard attenuation,

395
00:25:55,711 --> 00:25:57,273
which puts the player in a kind of

396
00:25:57,373 --> 00:25:59,435
uncomfortable onlooker situation.

397
00:26:00,284 --> 00:26:05,466
Such as hiding behind a bush, or maybe it's killer cam POV from behind a bush, moving around.

398
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:12,208
In this situation here, all the distant character sound is audible, but the tree rustle is also audible,

399
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:15,809
adding to that kind of uncomfortable placement of the viewer or the player.

400
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,570
And this is a great feature for horror.

401
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:25,313
Moving on to Azimuth. This is a WI's screen grab, of course.

402
00:26:26,517 --> 00:26:30,359
How do we attenuate the sound by angle of emitter from listener?

403
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,701
It's a kind of mise-en-scene approach.

404
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:35,682
We want to attenuate sounds when they are off screen.

405
00:26:36,823 --> 00:26:40,064
And it's a kind of subtle focus pull for the on-screen sound.

406
00:26:40,925 --> 00:26:44,006
So we decrease the volume, a little bit of high-pass and low-pass,

407
00:26:44,046 --> 00:26:46,288
nothing too clever there, but it's a good result.

408
00:26:47,808 --> 00:26:50,510
So with the character on the edge of the screen,

409
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,491
we have full volume, no filters.

410
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:57,235
to when the character is behind the listener or the camera.

411
00:26:57,695 --> 00:27:00,157
There's reduced volume and maximum filtering.

412
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:03,780
So it's a slightly muffled, less focus in the mix,

413
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,723
less clarity, and we have different settings for dialogue.

414
00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:09,664
This is the Foley setup.

415
00:27:09,724 --> 00:27:13,687
Dialogue is, of course, dominant with less attenuated sound.

416
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:16,870
So with interactive mix,

417
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,091
a quick look at our sidechain bussing.

418
00:27:19,131 --> 00:27:21,973
This is our basic top-down priority.

419
00:27:22,686 --> 00:27:25,128
We use a combination of sidechain volume ducking,

420
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,029
sidechain EQ band ducking,

421
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,971
especially prevalent with dialogue,

422
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:30,492
taking one K out of other elements.

423
00:27:31,393 --> 00:27:33,634
And we do sidechain compression, of course,

424
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:34,395
that's super smooth.

425
00:27:35,556 --> 00:27:38,638
And the lower priority sounds can rise up in the gaps.

426
00:27:38,678 --> 00:27:40,860
So this enables us to really focus the mix

427
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,662
on the action we want the player or the viewer to be seeing.

428
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,044
And it keeps clarity, of course,

429
00:27:46,084 --> 00:27:48,526
within the dense cinematic mix that we're aiming for.

430
00:27:50,107 --> 00:27:52,008
And we do some cool stuff, actually, with this.

431
00:27:52,813 --> 00:27:58,897
In Little Hope, the second in Season 1, we added something that placed all the diegetic

432
00:27:58,937 --> 00:28:05,120
sound in fog and through various plugins and RTPCs we had analog control on how those sounds

433
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,021
reacted to the fog.

434
00:28:07,542 --> 00:28:12,705
And additionally for Little Hope, we had control over the pitch of all the atmospheres, 2D

435
00:28:12,765 --> 00:28:12,945
and 3D.

436
00:28:14,587 --> 00:28:16,208
The reason for this, it was matching the kind of

437
00:28:16,248 --> 00:28:19,050
psychological state of the protagonist in that game.

438
00:28:19,911 --> 00:28:23,053
And it was just a really effective way of preceding scares.

439
00:28:23,093 --> 00:28:25,515
We could literally bend reality.

440
00:28:25,695 --> 00:28:26,656
So we have a lot of fun with that.

441
00:28:28,437 --> 00:28:30,199
But the example I want to show today

442
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:33,921
is a scene called Boat Fight from The Devil in Me,

443
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,242
which was the fourth dark picture.

444
00:28:36,303 --> 00:28:37,204
Came out last November.

445
00:28:38,045 --> 00:28:39,085
It's a high action scene.

446
00:28:39,746 --> 00:28:40,967
And the challenge in this scene

447
00:28:41,007 --> 00:28:42,608
is to keep the intensity of the scene.

448
00:28:42,768 --> 00:28:43,929
And there's a lot going on.

449
00:28:44,822 --> 00:28:46,923
We want to focus on the right action.

450
00:28:48,304 --> 00:28:50,325
So this is our basic mix broken out a bit

451
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:52,586
to leave some space for other elements.

452
00:28:54,267 --> 00:28:57,289
So unique to the scene is the boat engine revs.

453
00:28:58,890 --> 00:28:59,791
There is a boat in the scene.

454
00:29:00,731 --> 00:29:02,452
So unique to the scene is the boat engine revs

455
00:29:02,692 --> 00:29:04,914
and there's also a boat loop which help fill the gaps

456
00:29:05,374 --> 00:29:07,315
between those key SFX.

457
00:29:09,036 --> 00:29:10,297
We had a lot of water.

458
00:29:12,766 --> 00:29:14,767
Lots of incidental water splashes,

459
00:29:14,807 --> 00:29:16,447
characters falling in the water, etc.

460
00:29:16,968 --> 00:29:18,888
And we had constant water around the hull of the boat

461
00:29:18,908 --> 00:29:19,669
as it was going along.

462
00:29:22,029 --> 00:29:23,550
There was a lot of combat sound effects,

463
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:26,211
there was a lot of punching and stabbing and kicking

464
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:27,832
and all that stuff going on on the boat as well.

465
00:29:28,712 --> 00:29:30,653
So we wanted these elements to be very strong,

466
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:32,674
hold a lot of weight in the mix.

467
00:29:34,254 --> 00:29:36,275
And we of course had a dynamic breath system

468
00:29:36,415 --> 00:29:37,295
for all the characters.

469
00:29:39,202 --> 00:29:42,923
So we had a lot of submixes going on.

470
00:29:43,103 --> 00:29:45,984
We submixed dialogue against the breath system,

471
00:29:46,024 --> 00:29:48,245
basically full ducking on a per character basis

472
00:29:49,085 --> 00:29:49,965
when dialogue played.

473
00:29:51,506 --> 00:29:54,227
There was another submix with the combat sound effects

474
00:29:54,287 --> 00:29:56,588
ducking the main procedural Foley systems.

475
00:29:58,648 --> 00:30:02,590
The water spot effects ducked the more constant

476
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,291
water elements due to, just to allow them to stand out.

477
00:30:08,012 --> 00:30:10,614
And the water spots also ducked the boat engine

478
00:30:11,195 --> 00:30:13,577
due to a frequency range clash in the high end.

479
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:18,001
Engine revs, of course, ducked the engine loops

480
00:30:18,061 --> 00:30:19,322
to add intensity.

481
00:30:21,304 --> 00:30:23,386
Music and sound design had a low pass

482
00:30:23,426 --> 00:30:25,367
ducking on the water in the engine loops

483
00:30:26,068 --> 00:30:28,190
to clean up the mix when the water was pumping,

484
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,992
was high enough in level.

485
00:30:32,136 --> 00:30:36,319
Dialogue had its normal varied ducking on pretty much everything

486
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:38,801
to make it audible regardless of what was going on.

487
00:30:40,202 --> 00:30:42,323
And the explosions, similar to dialogue,

488
00:30:42,663 --> 00:30:44,525
ducked everything by a relatively high amount

489
00:30:45,065 --> 00:30:46,846
to make them feel bigger in the mix.

490
00:30:47,226 --> 00:30:48,267
So I hope you're all still with this.

491
00:30:50,428 --> 00:30:52,610
And atmospheres, they basically got ducked by everything.

492
00:30:53,831 --> 00:30:54,491
Poor atmospheres.

493
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:57,653
But when they rose up in the mix,

494
00:30:57,693 --> 00:30:59,555
it reminded you you were out on a lake,

495
00:30:59,675 --> 00:31:00,535
it was windy and cold.

496
00:31:03,985 --> 00:31:06,446
So, looking at the example from The Devil in Me,

497
00:31:07,086 --> 00:31:08,226
take note that in this scene,

498
00:31:08,346 --> 00:31:09,447
all of the characters can be dead,

499
00:31:10,087 --> 00:31:10,987
all of them can be alive.

500
00:31:11,247 --> 00:31:12,247
There's massive branching.

501
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:16,429
Depending on the actions of the player throughout the game,

502
00:31:16,469 --> 00:31:17,929
there's different collectibles in the game

503
00:31:17,949 --> 00:31:19,810
which can be used as weapons.

504
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,130
So there's a whole variety there.

505
00:31:22,071 --> 00:31:23,311
There's a heck of a lot of camera cuts

506
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:24,371
and perspective changes.

507
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:27,712
So all the attenuations and azimuth and 50% center bias,

508
00:31:27,732 --> 00:31:28,393
that's all at work.

509
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,273
And there are slow-mos,

510
00:31:30,353 --> 00:31:32,594
which basically kind of trounce the soundscape.

511
00:31:35,334 --> 00:31:37,299
Which kind of affects the pace of the scene.

512
00:31:39,845 --> 00:31:42,531
So let's see how that all came together in game.

513
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:58,287
I think I wouldn't be able to do it.

514
00:33:39,156 --> 00:33:39,736
What a way to go.

515
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,463
So one of the unique features that we created for The Devil in Me as well

516
00:33:49,503 --> 00:33:50,604
was the directional microphone.

517
00:33:52,806 --> 00:33:54,567
And this was an absolute gift to the sound team.

518
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:56,228
Someone comes to you and says, oh, there's this listening device.

519
00:33:56,248 --> 00:33:58,590
In fact, it was Tom just sitting here, came to us and said,

520
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,611
there's this listening device we designed for this game.

521
00:34:01,812 --> 00:34:02,873
It's a player-controlled...

522
00:34:04,774 --> 00:34:07,196
Sorry, one of the characters in the game, Aaron, I should fill you in actually,

523
00:34:07,236 --> 00:34:08,037
is a sound recordist.

524
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,571
So there's a reason for the microphone being there.

525
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:12,591
It's actually a key gameplay mechanic,

526
00:34:12,611 --> 00:34:13,411
so it had to work well.

527
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,612
It's a player-controlled shotgun mic in third person.

528
00:34:18,193 --> 00:34:18,773
No brainer, right?

529
00:34:20,813 --> 00:34:22,834
So we had to create an in-game simulation.

530
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,755
We could decide whether it was cardioid, hypercardioid,

531
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,735
how directional, how that affected the sense

532
00:34:29,755 --> 00:34:30,936
of horror and claustrophobia.

533
00:34:32,176 --> 00:34:34,677
We simulated off-access mic attenuation,

534
00:34:34,717 --> 00:34:36,957
and we actually went for a hyper-real result.

535
00:34:37,603 --> 00:34:42,365
with the off axis kind of bleeding or sending to the reverbs a little bit more.

536
00:34:44,385 --> 00:34:51,527
Additionally, Erin's character or the player can take Erin's headphones on and off at will.

537
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:53,747
So we needed to be able to flip the mix.

538
00:34:53,927 --> 00:35:00,028
So it was all RTPC values, all at runtime and all sort of available on an analog slider.

539
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:03,080
And on top of this, similar to the gun foley,

540
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,380
we added mic handling.

541
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,821
So it's kind of all the noises you don't want,

542
00:35:07,062 --> 00:35:08,382
we were able to simulate.

543
00:35:08,742 --> 00:35:10,343
We don't want normally, sorry, when you're recording.

544
00:35:12,724 --> 00:35:14,565
So this feature reviewed really well.

545
00:35:15,026 --> 00:35:18,127
A great quote from NME, which I love,

546
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:19,488
and people are bored of me saying it,

547
00:35:19,788 --> 00:35:23,330
is like a horror ASMR, which I just think is awesome.

548
00:35:25,613 --> 00:35:26,613
So how does it look in Wwise?

549
00:35:26,673 --> 00:35:27,894
Well, it's actually pretty simple for audio.

550
00:35:28,534 --> 00:35:30,875
We had lots of control via the azimuth system,

551
00:35:30,915 --> 00:35:32,115
but you'll notice the curves are

552
00:35:32,695 --> 00:35:34,156
a little bit more extreme here.

553
00:35:35,476 --> 00:35:38,057
We've added aux send variants, as I mentioned.

554
00:35:38,077 --> 00:35:39,277
There was, for the off-axis,

555
00:35:39,317 --> 00:35:41,298
there's a lot of increased aux send.

556
00:35:42,518 --> 00:35:45,199
And worth noting, we decided in the end

557
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:48,860
to have this azimuth based on camera direction

558
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,721
rather than third-person character direction.

559
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,315
because the character can turn around and walk towards you.

560
00:35:53,335 --> 00:35:57,483
And it just seemed to fit the kind of the player's perspective better.

561
00:36:00,649 --> 00:36:03,175
So let's see how that looked and sounded in-game.

562
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:48,650
I won't be scared long.

563
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:50,252
Sing it.

564
00:37:50,472 --> 00:37:52,716
And I won't be scared long.

565
00:38:12,706 --> 00:38:13,066
Is that good?

566
00:38:13,086 --> 00:38:14,748
I knew it was coming.

567
00:38:14,808 --> 00:38:15,588
I don't know anymore, man.

568
00:38:15,608 --> 00:38:16,049
I don't know.

569
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:16,409
It's like, what?

570
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:16,729
I don't know.

571
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,551
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

572
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:19,512
Thank you for sharing that.

573
00:38:21,353 --> 00:38:24,195
So let's take a little musical interlude from all the systems.

574
00:38:25,757 --> 00:38:31,241
So Jason Graves composed all the music for Season 1, and it's just a massive variety.

575
00:38:32,122 --> 00:38:36,846
Completely different scores for each game, reflecting, of course, and driving the narrative,

576
00:38:36,866 --> 00:38:40,368
visualizing the location, the historical era.

577
00:38:41,336 --> 00:38:46,978
fitting the horror sub-genre, and we have a lot of fun and experimentation with the music.

578
00:38:48,379 --> 00:38:50,300
Looking back at the four games from season one,

579
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,921
Man of Medan was all written in 3-4, representing the waves. It's kind of like a waltz.

580
00:38:56,322 --> 00:39:00,964
It was based in the South Pacific, full orchestral score, very sort of traditional orchestral horror.

581
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:12,594
Little Hope was a more minimal soundscape based on research of instruments from the 1692 Salem area of North America.

582
00:39:15,255 --> 00:39:29,881
House of Ashes, there were 4000 year old Sumerian kind of backdrop in Iraq with a strident signature and the whole score progressed from being orchestral to being sort of very hybrid, very synth based.

583
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:35,875
horror as we realize, spoiler, that the vampires are aliens.

584
00:39:36,855 --> 00:39:41,338
And lastly, Devil in Me was harking back to 1892 Chicago.

585
00:39:41,738 --> 00:39:45,040
We decided that a Bernard Herrmann kind of nod

586
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,682
to Hitchcock's Psycho just really fitted the right tone

587
00:39:48,903 --> 00:39:50,043
for that score.

588
00:39:51,464 --> 00:39:53,125
And in The Devil in Me as well,

589
00:39:53,165 --> 00:39:56,607
we also played a lot of classical and operatic pieces

590
00:39:57,087 --> 00:39:58,688
underscored with aleatorics.

591
00:39:59,354 --> 00:40:06,257
orchestral techniques to add to some dramatic moments which we'll come to later.

592
00:40:08,398 --> 00:40:14,561
So here's a two-minute medley showing some of the variety from Season 1, which is just

593
00:40:14,601 --> 00:40:18,903
not doing it any justice at all, but hopefully you'll get a sense of the variety. All of

594
00:40:18,943 --> 00:40:22,084
these tracks are available on Spotify, so you can follow up on anything you like there.

595
00:40:22,284 --> 00:40:24,325
But here's a two-minute medley from Dark Pictures Season 1.

596
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:42,314
Hope you enjoyed that.

597
00:42:45,756 --> 00:42:46,636
So back to the systems.

598
00:42:47,817 --> 00:42:51,098
Music, diegetic music rising up into full score.

599
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:58,062
So we have a system which at runtime using RTPCs

600
00:42:58,142 --> 00:43:00,543
can bring diegetic music starts in the world

601
00:43:01,243 --> 00:43:02,844
into full score for added drama.

602
00:43:04,565 --> 00:43:07,286
In The Devil in Me, these were classical operatic pieces.

603
00:43:07,867 --> 00:43:10,728
They would start as a mono file being played

604
00:43:10,748 --> 00:43:11,428
from a gramophone.

605
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,612
and rise up to stereo score.

606
00:43:14,293 --> 00:43:16,015
We had three RTPCs we could control.

607
00:43:16,516 --> 00:43:20,260
One controlled a mix between the mono and the stereo files that you can see here.

608
00:43:21,562 --> 00:43:26,948
Another RTPC controlled a kind of reverb send to, you know, effectively a kind of really

609
00:43:27,008 --> 00:43:31,593
bathed reverb so we could really add some tails to the moments.

610
00:43:32,682 --> 00:43:36,726
And we also had another RTPC which controlled a distortion

611
00:43:37,466 --> 00:43:40,729
if we wanted to really nasty up some of this music

612
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:41,970
at crucial moments.

613
00:43:44,332 --> 00:43:46,633
So technically, it was very simple in Wwise,

614
00:43:46,673 --> 00:43:48,295
but the difficulty was authoring.

615
00:43:48,315 --> 00:43:51,297
We were working with stereo files,

616
00:43:51,597 --> 00:43:54,780
so it made transitions difficult for the interactive sections.

617
00:43:56,281 --> 00:43:58,943
And we were working with stereo classical pieces.

618
00:44:00,273 --> 00:44:02,755
But we think we kind of got to an amazing result.

619
00:44:02,775 --> 00:44:04,416
We had to make a lot of compromises along the way.

620
00:44:04,816 --> 00:44:06,897
And there was the odd dodgy edit that made it to release,

621
00:44:06,957 --> 00:44:09,439
but it was very difficult to kind of control those.

622
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,942
So here's another example from The Devil and Me,

623
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:15,462
fourth in the series from the dark pictures,

624
00:44:16,723 --> 00:44:20,966
where music by design signifies an impending murder

625
00:44:21,146 --> 00:44:21,966
or potential murder,

626
00:44:23,047 --> 00:44:24,328
depending on the branches that you choose.

627
00:44:25,589 --> 00:44:26,349
In this example,

628
00:44:26,409 --> 00:44:29,171
the music starts diegetically outside the door.

629
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:34,963
We maintain some directionality throughout the scene,

630
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:38,725
swelling it a little bit into the full score

631
00:44:38,765 --> 00:44:41,366
at different points for added kind of confusion and drama.

632
00:44:42,366 --> 00:44:43,867
And then at the end, as you'll see,

633
00:44:44,087 --> 00:44:48,249
it rises to full score for a very specific reason.

634
00:45:05,442 --> 00:45:05,962
Um

635
00:45:06,783 --> 00:45:07,443
Hey, hey hello

636
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:37,550
I'm here!

637
00:45:38,831 --> 00:45:39,431
I'm-

638
00:46:07,088 --> 00:46:11,791
Stop! Please! Stop! Please!

639
00:46:29,644 --> 00:46:31,865
First you need a fireLID, then you need an ATMUG

640
00:46:32,005 --> 00:46:35,626
Then you need an items that gives you something to collect

641
00:46:35,646 --> 00:46:40,727
Finally you need ATMUG, then you need items that give you a new armor

642
00:46:40,747 --> 00:46:43,968
Finally you need more items that gives you a new shield

643
00:46:44,028 --> 00:46:49,269
Run through all the scrolls before the final 3 doors

644
00:46:49,289 --> 00:46:54,131
Thankfully this isn't the entire game, this was the first to me

645
00:46:54,151 --> 00:46:55,071
See you around

646
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:13,412
Another way to go.

647
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:39,239
So what for the future of the Dark Pictures Anthology?

648
00:47:39,279 --> 00:47:41,160
Well, we're already into DP5,

649
00:47:42,001 --> 00:47:43,542
which is the season two opener.

650
00:47:44,422 --> 00:47:46,763
This one's called Directive 8020.

651
00:47:47,744 --> 00:47:50,105
And now we get to take horror to space.

652
00:47:50,846 --> 00:47:56,209
This is Commander Stafford

653
00:47:56,229 --> 00:47:58,870
of the Ford Reconnaissance Vessel Cassiopeia.

654
00:48:00,539 --> 00:48:10,043
After successfully rendezvousing with the curb, this marker we have detached the booster ring and spurts a high as we make our final approach to Tal City F.

655
00:48:11,243 --> 00:48:18,206
The ship has suffered a hull impact but damage is minimal and our technicians are restoring full functionality.

656
00:48:18,746 --> 00:48:21,988
This is Thomas Carter. Something's wrong with Sims.

657
00:48:22,928 --> 00:48:24,609
She's trying to kill me! I think...

658
00:48:28,802 --> 00:48:34,203
Our next transmission will be broadcast from orbit around humanity's future home.

659
00:48:36,263 --> 00:48:36,864
Stafford out.

660
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:50,847
Thanks very much for listening.

661
00:49:01,614 --> 00:49:02,615
Does anybody have any questions?

662
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:09,941
You're meant to be answering them, Jason.

663
00:49:12,117 --> 00:49:17,378
We actually never discussed this and I'm curious, so I'm curious with all the

664
00:49:17,418 --> 00:49:21,980
procedural stuff, all the choices in these games, just for the last one, the

665
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:26,441
devil in me, do you have any idea if you took all of the different options that

666
00:49:26,481 --> 00:49:30,902
are available to the players and stack them in one long linear game, how long

667
00:49:30,942 --> 00:49:34,763
that would be versus how long the average playthrough is when you're

668
00:49:34,783 --> 00:49:36,484
making all those individual decisions?

669
00:49:37,084 --> 00:49:39,205
So, yeah, so if you, so all of the.

670
00:49:39,812 --> 00:49:41,793
So it's gameplay versus length of material,

671
00:49:42,254 --> 00:49:44,676
because of the choices that you don't take when you're playing.

672
00:49:46,237 --> 00:49:48,559
Off the top of my head, I'm aiming like 20%, 30%

673
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,081
extra material.

674
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:52,322
More?

675
00:49:52,963 --> 00:49:53,443
What's the number?

676
00:49:54,965 --> 00:49:55,065
It's 500%?

677
00:49:55,365 --> 00:49:56,906
No, I don't know.

678
00:49:58,508 --> 00:49:59,248
We don't really know.

679
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:02,131
Closer to double.

680
00:50:02,651 --> 00:50:03,632
They say somewhere between 40% and 50%.

681
00:50:05,453 --> 00:50:07,815
It's a lot, and actually makes QA really hard for testing.

682
00:50:09,576 --> 00:50:12,139
And new branches can appear without you knowing as well,

683
00:50:12,359 --> 00:50:13,159
especially towards the end.

684
00:50:14,821 --> 00:50:17,083
Yes, I know there's a lot of extra work we put in.

685
00:50:17,503 --> 00:50:20,886
And it keeps the replayability of the games solid as well.

686
00:50:21,867 --> 00:50:23,288
Yeah, absolutely.

687
00:50:24,089 --> 00:50:25,570
Actually, I have a question for Jason.

688
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:27,171
Did you write that opera piece?

689
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:28,916
Oh, OK.

690
00:50:29,656 --> 00:50:30,797
Because I actually played this game.

691
00:50:30,997 --> 00:50:32,678
And I'm really glad I got to see him die,

692
00:50:32,718 --> 00:50:34,779
because I chose to go under the grate.

693
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:36,540
And that's the way that he survived.

694
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,581
But it was a pretty great piece.

695
00:50:38,681 --> 00:50:40,842
Barney and the team kicked out the diegetic music ahead

696
00:50:40,882 --> 00:50:41,202
of time.

697
00:50:42,343 --> 00:50:43,243
Stab at Matter.

698
00:50:43,263 --> 00:50:45,144
Is it Pug a Lazy?

699
00:50:45,844 --> 00:50:46,785
I'm really bad on opera.

700
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:48,206
Can anyone qualify that?

701
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:50,547
I'll go with that, then.

702
00:50:51,187 --> 00:50:51,347
Yeah.

703
00:50:52,661 --> 00:50:56,464
Actually, the story is that Ollie, who edited that piece,

704
00:50:57,025 --> 00:50:59,046
he was working from home with his partner,

705
00:50:59,787 --> 00:51:02,469
and apparently she cried when he showed it to her.

706
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:09,475
And, you know, so yeah, we succeeded in emotionally engaging Ollie's partner.

707
00:51:12,846 --> 00:51:16,327
I have a question regarding the dev cycle that you were mentioning,

708
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:19,527
and obviously the importance of working with the systemic audio

709
00:51:19,547 --> 00:51:21,028
to actually be able to catch up with that.

710
00:51:22,028 --> 00:51:24,188
All the other teams, all the other departments,

711
00:51:24,908 --> 00:51:26,709
the cinematic teams, the animations and so on,

712
00:51:26,749 --> 00:51:29,189
were they also working on that space of one year,

713
00:51:29,369 --> 00:51:31,910
or was it just for the audio team, so maybe stacking it up?

714
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:33,850
Yeah, good question.

715
00:51:34,050 --> 00:51:39,991
Each project has had its delays or advances

716
00:51:40,691 --> 00:51:41,692
every time we've rolled over.

717
00:51:42,762 --> 00:51:45,823
House of Ashes, for example, there were like five or six levels ready to go.

718
00:51:45,843 --> 00:51:49,944
Other projects haven't been so lucky, they've been maybe held up by the one before,

719
00:51:50,684 --> 00:51:51,404
which is very logical.

720
00:51:53,885 --> 00:51:57,386
On the whole, the kind of cinematics team,

721
00:51:57,706 --> 00:51:59,226
there's a heck of a lot recorded early,

722
00:51:59,706 --> 00:52:01,687
and it starts hitting the game in kind of a rough form,

723
00:52:01,727 --> 00:52:02,887
and that can be quite varied.

724
00:52:03,867 --> 00:52:06,788
It's really a kind of key year where we're all piling in,

725
00:52:07,148 --> 00:52:08,949
kind of give or take a couple of months basically.

726
00:52:09,509 --> 00:52:10,069
Okay, good.

727
00:52:10,089 --> 00:52:10,429
Thank you.

728
00:52:10,969 --> 00:52:11,209
Cool, man.

729
00:52:13,722 --> 00:52:16,905
Hi there. Well, that was kind of my question, but I'm going to have a second one.

730
00:52:17,465 --> 00:52:21,929
Again, great job. That was fantastic. I'm actually interested, I work in production,

731
00:52:21,969 --> 00:52:25,672
so for me I'm actually very interested to see the pre-production moments, when you know

732
00:52:26,312 --> 00:52:30,215
the next theme of a game, of the same installment, how do you approach it?

733
00:52:30,695 --> 00:52:33,758
What do you have in the moment to get your team started?

734
00:52:34,378 --> 00:52:37,541
And where you get your references and whatever you...

735
00:52:38,301 --> 00:52:42,385
So I think, yeah, so I think the question is, what do you do before the game's ready

736
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:42,805
to kind of...

737
00:52:43,482 --> 00:52:47,285
develop the ideas. The answer is the best thing you can.

738
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:51,788
Sometimes you've got nothing to go on, sometimes you have a film reference.

739
00:52:51,848 --> 00:52:55,390
We resound sections of films to prove to ourselves

740
00:52:55,450 --> 00:52:56,611
how we want to make it sound.

741
00:52:59,853 --> 00:53:03,475
Or you can go to simple mood board stuff, a YouTube

742
00:53:03,535 --> 00:53:07,538
playlist for music for example. Sometimes

743
00:53:07,578 --> 00:53:11,080
you have a ten minute section of a vertical slice which is

744
00:53:11,361 --> 00:53:11,761
okay.

745
00:53:12,633 --> 00:53:14,154
And so we can take that out as a video

746
00:53:14,194 --> 00:53:15,875
and then just pre-vis the heck out of it.

747
00:53:16,135 --> 00:53:17,657
All the departments can kind of pile in.

748
00:53:18,457 --> 00:53:20,559
So I think the short answer is whatever you can do.

749
00:53:20,619 --> 00:53:25,162
I mean, I've done it with like hand-drawn images

750
00:53:25,842 --> 00:53:29,325
from a storyboard that I've kind of thrown into iMovie,

751
00:53:29,345 --> 00:53:30,005
this was a while ago,

752
00:53:30,906 --> 00:53:32,908
and stretched them out to kind of rough timings

753
00:53:33,208 --> 00:53:36,570
and then sunk a sting to a cut

754
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,672
between a distant and a closeup.

755
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:40,430
You know, storyboard.

756
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,692
So it's whatever you can get your hands on.

757
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:44,613
And just prove it to yourself, basically,

758
00:53:44,633 --> 00:53:45,614
that this is what you want.

759
00:53:45,634 --> 00:53:46,515
All right.

760
00:53:46,575 --> 00:53:47,575
And tough question.

761
00:53:47,615 --> 00:53:49,617
It's like choosing which are you prefer the most,

762
00:53:49,697 --> 00:53:52,179
but which of the four games here did you

763
00:53:52,219 --> 00:53:53,560
have the most fun working on?

764
00:53:57,462 --> 00:53:59,184
I can't say which one exactly.

765
00:53:59,204 --> 00:54:00,545
I can say which one was the toughest.

766
00:54:00,605 --> 00:54:02,586
It was the first of the four, because we

767
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:03,627
were formulating everything.

768
00:54:04,447 --> 00:54:07,229
I mean, it was, yeah, it was kind of like, you know,

769
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:09,331
I think we took a lot for granted in that game.

770
00:54:10,075 --> 00:54:13,859
Because we obviously had Until Dawn experience, we were like, yeah, we know what we're doing, you know.

771
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,263
And, no, actually, we wanted to change things, we wanted to improve things.

772
00:54:18,364 --> 00:54:19,886
So there was a lot of design iteration.

773
00:54:19,906 --> 00:54:25,592
I should say, actually, Tom Heaton here was the game director on both the first and the fourth.

774
00:54:26,593 --> 00:54:29,216
So if you've got some production questions, you might want to tag him.

775
00:54:29,857 --> 00:54:30,177
Thank you.

776
00:54:30,397 --> 00:54:30,858
Yeah, no problem.

777
00:54:33,535 --> 00:54:38,916
I have a small technical question, a bit more about implementation I guess, regarding the

778
00:54:38,996 --> 00:54:40,516
procedural Foley system.

779
00:54:41,836 --> 00:54:46,997
How did you detect different kind of triggers and what information was being sent there?

780
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:51,938
I guess you had sliding and contacts and detecting materials?

781
00:54:52,738 --> 00:54:58,239
Yeah, so we've changed the system recently so I'm a little bit vague on some of it.

782
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,840
We had before.

783
00:55:04,265 --> 00:55:08,208
a distance to bone between here and also speed of movement.

784
00:55:09,609 --> 00:55:11,730
So one of the kind of key features of this whole system,

785
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,692
there's a bit of special sauce in there,

786
00:55:14,012 --> 00:55:15,933
but one of the key features is emitter speed.

787
00:55:16,454 --> 00:55:19,756
So if it's triggering long samples or short samples,

788
00:55:20,096 --> 00:55:20,677
it doesn't matter.

789
00:55:21,137 --> 00:55:22,999
As soon as that emitter stops moving,

790
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:26,741
it's in sync.

791
00:55:27,222 --> 00:55:29,763
So where the sounds end are just as crucial as where they start.

792
00:55:31,044 --> 00:55:32,105
Yeah, we have like...

793
00:55:32,998 --> 00:55:39,174
Surface detection, emitter speed, chest emitter speed is something which indicates walk and run and also walk slow.

794
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:44,701
Yeah, I mean it's just tweaking the settings on those.

795
00:55:45,081 --> 00:55:48,202
I think a lot of games companies do very similar things to that.

796
00:55:49,162 --> 00:55:53,323
We were quite advanced a few years ago, but a few different studios have caught up.

797
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:57,084
But yeah, it's just tweaking the values and poring over them.

798
00:55:57,364 --> 00:56:02,146
And we use those same values for all the characters with a body variant switch to play

799
00:56:02,566 --> 00:56:08,668
different samples that are material consistent or shoe type consistent or character consistent.

800
00:56:09,955 --> 00:56:10,175
Thanks.

801
00:56:10,255 --> 00:56:11,356
Okay, there's a bit left, cool.

802
00:56:14,178 --> 00:56:15,139
Okay, cool.

803
00:56:15,999 --> 00:56:16,780
Well, thanks very much.

804
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:18,681
I've enjoyed it.

805
00:56:18,701 --> 00:56:19,562
Thank you.
