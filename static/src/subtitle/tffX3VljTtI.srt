1
00:00:04,533 --> 00:00:07,113
OK, I've been told it's time to get started.

2
00:00:07,213 --> 00:00:08,914
Wow, there is a huge echo up here.

3
00:00:08,974 --> 00:00:10,454
That's going to be fun for the next hour.

4
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:16,396
All right, so you folks all do realize you're here to hear

5
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:17,856
about a 17-year-old game, right?

6
00:00:18,336 --> 00:00:23,577
Welcome.

7
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:24,858
I'll take that as a yes.

8
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:29,819
So for starters, people often ask me which of my games I

9
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:32,840
like the best, or which I think is the best.

10
00:00:33,832 --> 00:00:37,793
and don't ever ask a game developer that question. The

11
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:41,394
closest I ever get to answering is saying that the game I'm most

12
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:46,835
proud of is Deus Ex for a variety of reasons. And I'm here

13
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:53,037
today to talk about how that game came to be. So let me start

14
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:57,578
by telling you specifically what I want to talk about. First, I

15
00:00:57,618 --> 00:01:00,259
want to talk about the design philosophies behind the creation

16
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:01,840
of Deus Ex, why I wanted to make it.

17
00:01:02,978 --> 00:01:05,119
Then I want to talk about the history behind the making of

18
00:01:05,179 --> 00:01:10,121
the game. Third, we'll go into what we did right and what I

19
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:14,103
did right and wrong. And then finally, we'll end with the

20
00:01:14,163 --> 00:01:18,284
response to the game, how the world responded. A lot of what

21
00:01:18,304 --> 00:01:22,206
you're going to hear and see today is common practice now.

22
00:01:22,786 --> 00:01:27,648
Rest assured that a lot of it was not common practice in the

23
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:31,630
late 1990s when we were working on this game. Okay. So

24
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,801
don't make too much fun of me for telling you things you already know. Make as much fun of me

25
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:43,603
as you want. I don't care. Okay. So let's start by talking about what Deus Ex actually is.

26
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:50,245
Fictionally it's a game set in a near future dystopic cyber punk version of our real world.

27
00:01:51,365 --> 00:01:53,486
It's a world where conspiracy theories are true.

28
00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:57,962
And it's kind of James Bond meets the X-Files by way of

29
00:01:58,042 --> 00:01:58,802
Neuromancer.

30
00:01:59,002 --> 00:02:01,004
I assume from the applause earlier, you

31
00:02:01,024 --> 00:02:01,825
guys all know that.

32
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:07,469
Conceptually, I thought of Deus Ex as a genre-busting game,

33
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:12,374
which, let me say, really enamored us to the marketing

34
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:12,954
folks.

35
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:13,975
They love that.

36
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:17,258
If you ever want to make a marketing person unhappy, mash

37
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:18,178
up genres together.

38
00:02:18,619 --> 00:02:19,660
They'll be your friend for life.

39
00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:26,698
But it was a genre mashup. It was part immersive simulation. It was part role playing game. It was

40
00:02:26,758 --> 00:02:31,742
part first person shooter. And it was part adventure game. So it was a bunch of stuff all mashed

41
00:02:31,782 --> 00:02:37,968
together. It's an immersive simulation because you feel like you're actually in the game world, or

42
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:43,973
at least that's what we were trying to do. There's as little as possible getting in the way of you

43
00:02:44,073 --> 00:02:49,077
feeling like you're there. And that kind of defines what an immersive simulation is for me.

44
00:02:49,672 --> 00:02:51,552
It's an RPG in that you play a role.

45
00:02:51,652 --> 00:02:56,373
You play JC Denton, which translates to me to an R-O-L-E

46
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:58,653
role, not an R-O-L-L role.

47
00:03:01,274 --> 00:03:03,714
And you make choices that ensure you end up with a

48
00:03:03,794 --> 00:03:04,674
unique avatar.

49
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,395
And your character determines your experience.

50
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:08,435
So it's a role playing game.

51
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:11,276
It's an FPS because you see the world through your

52
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:12,176
character's eyes.

53
00:03:13,056 --> 00:03:15,296
And your skill with virtual weapons is clearly an

54
00:03:15,536 --> 00:03:16,297
important factor.

55
00:03:17,557 --> 00:03:19,577
And it's an adventure game in that it's story driven.

56
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:23,338
Its narrative structure is completely linear.

57
00:03:23,378 --> 00:03:24,658
I hope you all realize that.

58
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:28,759
And it involves character interaction and accumulation of

59
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:30,979
objects to advance the plot.

60
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:33,139
So it has a little bit of all of those things.

61
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:35,720
And that's the most important thing.

62
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,940
It's the combination of those genres that was designed to

63
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,381
ensure that players would end up as collaborators with us in

64
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:42,561
the telling of that story.

65
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:45,621
I wanted the story to be as much yours.

66
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:50,287
as it was mine and my team's.

67
00:03:52,249 --> 00:03:53,870
So let me tell you where it began.

68
00:03:54,411 --> 00:03:55,852
This is gonna get a little embarrassing.

69
00:03:58,075 --> 00:03:59,817
It all began with Dungeons and Dragons.

70
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:02,720
Is there anybody here who hasn't played D&D?

71
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,063
Raise your hand if you haven't played D&D and then leave.

72
00:04:06,864 --> 00:04:08,426
Okay, all right.

73
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:15,590
Like I said, it's been 17 years since the game came out, but it really started long before that.

74
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:19,713
I am going to date myself horribly here, but it began in 1978.

75
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:24,017
And it began with a game of D&D.

76
00:04:25,118 --> 00:04:29,301
The day I discovered that game was literally life-changing for me.

77
00:04:29,461 --> 00:04:33,965
I would not be here, you would not be here, if not for a game of Dungeons & Dragons.

78
00:04:35,728 --> 00:04:39,689
My dungeon master was cyberpunk guru Bruce Sterling.

79
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,790
I don't know how many of you are familiar with him, but he

80
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,232
and Bill Gibson kind of started the whole cyberpunk thing.

81
00:04:47,812 --> 00:04:49,253
He was a great storyteller.

82
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:52,754
But what made the experience special wasn't the story that

83
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,755
Bruce was telling.

84
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,316
What made the experience special was that my friends

85
00:04:56,376 --> 00:04:58,317
and I were telling the story with him.

86
00:04:59,178 --> 00:05:03,681
We had to use our wits and some more or less vague rules

87
00:05:04,182 --> 00:05:07,044
to get around and over and through the obstacles

88
00:05:07,104 --> 00:05:08,245
that Bruce threw at us.

89
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:13,329
The shape of the story belonged to Bruce.

90
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,771
I mean, anybody who's played D&D knows this.

91
00:05:17,172 --> 00:05:20,175
But every detail belongs to us, okay?

92
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,957
So we all became storytellers that night.

93
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,750
And I was completely hooked.

94
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,451
I played on that D&D campaign for 10 years.

95
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:32,752
And the ending of that campaign was so dramatic

96
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,653
that if I told you about it,

97
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:38,053
you would absolutely make fun of me

98
00:05:38,073 --> 00:05:39,534
because I would start crying.

99
00:05:39,594 --> 00:05:40,574
It was so powerful.

100
00:05:41,334 --> 00:05:42,895
No, it was amazing.

101
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:44,835
I mean, maybe after, if anybody wants to know,

102
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:45,876
I'll tell you.

103
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:50,977
And then you would abuse me for crying over a D&D campaign.

104
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:57,554
So we're not going to go there. But ten years playing in that campaign was pretty amazing. So

105
00:05:57,754 --> 00:06:03,718
what does that have to do with ASX? Just everything. My entire career, this is the pathetic

106
00:06:03,758 --> 00:06:10,082
part of the talk. My entire career, 34 years of making games, has been about trying to

107
00:06:10,142 --> 00:06:16,787
recreate that feeling I had in 1978 when I played D&D for the first time. That's been my life

108
00:06:16,907 --> 00:06:19,088
mission, to recreate that feeling.

109
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:26,459
So to start to bring this around to Deus Ex,

110
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,062
I've been playing around with the notion

111
00:06:31,122 --> 00:06:34,444
of shared authorship, of that collaboration

112
00:06:34,484 --> 00:06:38,567
between developer and player, and immersive simulation,

113
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:40,788
that idea that we can make you really feel

114
00:06:40,828 --> 00:06:41,969
like you're in another world.

115
00:06:42,929 --> 00:06:44,430
Some friends and I have been talking about that

116
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,572
for a very long time and working in that field

117
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,453
in games like Underworld and System Shock.

118
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,781
and Thief and a variety of others.

119
00:06:53,562 --> 00:06:56,024
Every game I've worked on, every single one,

120
00:06:56,044 --> 00:06:58,346
has been about trying to engage all of you,

121
00:06:58,386 --> 00:07:00,367
engage players in the telling of the story.

122
00:07:01,308 --> 00:07:03,670
My only hope is just to do it a little better every time,

123
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,293
giving up a little bit more authorial control

124
00:07:07,353 --> 00:07:08,214
with every game.

125
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:13,078
But then, there came a point where, you know,

126
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:15,179
what we were doing in Underworld and System Shock

127
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:17,421
wasn't quite enough, and I decided it was time

128
00:07:17,441 --> 00:07:19,103
to kind of swing for the fences.

129
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,831
It was a period of time when I was sick to death of making

130
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:28,752
games about guys in plate armor swinging big swords. I was just

131
00:07:28,812 --> 00:07:32,073
tired of that. I had done enough of it. If I even thought about

132
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:34,814
making another game about you being the last space marine

133
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,134
between the earth and alien invasion, I was going to stop

134
00:07:37,175 --> 00:07:42,276
making games. As simple as that. And I wish every developer would

135
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:48,657
adopt that attitude. I wanted to make a game that I called the

136
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:50,198
real world role playing game.

137
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,949
I wanted to make a game where you could solve problems the way you wanted.

138
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:57,990
And I wanted your choices during play to make a difference in how the story played

139
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,412
out. And here's, here's kind of one of the keys.

140
00:08:03,112 --> 00:08:07,714
I wanted your choices to say more about you, the player, the human,

141
00:08:08,214 --> 00:08:10,995
with your hands on a keyboard and a mouse or a controller.

142
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:15,877
I wanted the choices to say more about you than they did about your end game

143
00:08:15,957 --> 00:08:19,418
avatar. I don't care about your puppet. I care about you.

144
00:08:20,937 --> 00:08:24,258
I wanted every player to get to the end of the game having had a unique experience.

145
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:31,740
In other words, I wanted to tell a story with players just the way Bruce had told a story with me and with my friends.

146
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:34,081
That was 1994.

147
00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:41,024
I was working at Origin, the place where they made the Ultima games. I have no idea if anybody remembers Origin.

148
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:44,785
We were... Okay, people remember Origin. Good.

149
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,184
I should give a whole talk about how special Origin was. Anyway, I came up with an idea that

150
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:58,449
would let me do all the stuff I just talked about. And that was a game called Troubleshooter. It

151
00:08:58,489 --> 00:09:05,014
was set in the world of 1995. You played a character called Jake Shooter, ex-CIA, now a

152
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:14,262
hard-boiled private eye. It was all very film noir. And Origin and EA weren't interested at

153
00:09:14,282 --> 00:09:16,704
all in a game like Troubleshooter, which was a game that was a lot like Troubleshooter.

154
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,399
became Deus Ex at some point.

155
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:21,099
I'll tell you all about that.

156
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:23,320
I couldn't tell you why they weren't interested,

157
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,301
but it's probably a good thing

158
00:09:24,341 --> 00:09:27,282
because trying to recreate the real world back in 1994

159
00:09:27,963 --> 00:09:30,744
was an insane thing to even think about.

160
00:09:30,764 --> 00:09:32,405
And I mean, it's probably still insane today,

161
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:33,905
but it was crazy.

162
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:35,026
But I shelved the idea.

163
00:09:35,546 --> 00:09:36,326
Ideas are easy.

164
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:38,587
Anybody who tells you that ideas are hard

165
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:40,888
or you should hold onto your ideas

166
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:42,709
because they're so amazing and valuable

167
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,231
is kind of nutso, right?

168
00:09:45,371 --> 00:09:45,991
Ideas are easy.

169
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:47,452
There are plenty of other games I wanted to make.

170
00:09:49,108 --> 00:09:53,773
A few years passed and I left Origin and worked for Looking

171
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:57,477
Glass for a while where one of the critical projects going on

172
00:09:57,537 --> 00:10:00,421
was a game called Thief. And something really critical

173
00:10:00,481 --> 00:10:04,425
happened during the Thief development. I played a build. I

174
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:07,949
came to a place that was just too hard for me to sneak.

175
00:10:09,032 --> 00:10:10,714
I was failing every time.

176
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:14,418
And I asked the team, just make me tough enough that I can

177
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:16,921
fight my way past these guards, because I'm getting

178
00:10:16,961 --> 00:10:17,802
killed every time.

179
00:10:18,323 --> 00:10:19,203
And they said no.

180
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:24,489
Because if we made the player character strong enough to

181
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,151
fight, no one would ever sneak.

182
00:10:26,271 --> 00:10:27,973
And the idea of the game was to sneak.

183
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:28,854
And they're probably right.

184
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:31,036
For Thief, that was probably the right decision to make.

185
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:39,038
But I made a vow right then that I was going to make a game that lets you fight or sneak as you chose.

186
00:10:39,947 --> 00:10:47,248
So not long after that, Looking Glass ran out of money. I mean, let's be frank. And so I was out

187
00:10:47,288 --> 00:10:53,850
on the street, you know, like panhandling and stuff and figured I should do a start-up. I blew

188
00:10:53,870 --> 00:11:00,171
the dust off that old troubleshooter proposal and amazingly enough convinced a company I won't

189
00:11:00,231 --> 00:11:05,592
name to let me make a role-playing game set in the universe of one of the most successful RTS

190
00:11:05,692 --> 00:11:07,732
lines around. And I won't tell you what that was either.

191
00:11:09,552 --> 00:11:12,834
and I was about to sign the contract when John Romero called

192
00:11:12,874 --> 00:11:16,256
me up and said, don't sign that contract. Join me at Ion Storm

193
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:18,537
and make the game of your dreams. No creative

194
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:21,099
interference. Biggest budget you've ever had. Biggest

195
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:24,220
marketing budget you've ever had. And I mean, who says no to

196
00:11:24,281 --> 00:11:31,505
that? Right? So I put that contract aside and Ion Storm

197
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:35,427
Austin was born. And this is when Deus Ex really got started.

198
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:45,295
Hold on. I had this idea for a game, the game of my dreams, but before I start on any project,

199
00:11:45,436 --> 00:11:49,458
I've done this for every single project I've ever worked on, and I encourage all of you to do

200
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:55,341
something like this before you start on your own projects. I asked myself a series of questions

201
00:11:55,381 --> 00:12:01,404
that I call the 6 plus 2 plus 1. Now, why I don't call it the 9, I don't know, but it's the 6 plus

202
00:12:01,584 --> 00:12:06,406
2 plus 1. And if the answers to these questions are no or I don't know, I don't make the game.

203
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:09,494
I have to have yes answers.

204
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:11,996
So here are those questions.

205
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:15,879
And this is not genius stuff, it's just something I do.

206
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,360
And I didn't even used to tell my teams about it,

207
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,220
which was really dumb.

208
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,622
But anyway, I'm gonna tell you about it.

209
00:12:21,603 --> 00:12:22,543
What's the core idea?

210
00:12:22,864 --> 00:12:25,125
Can you describe the game in one, two, or three sentences?

211
00:12:25,165 --> 00:12:26,606
It's kind of like the elevator pitch, right?

212
00:12:27,655 --> 00:12:31,338
For Deus Ex, the real world role playing game where players tell

213
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:36,302
their own stories. That was the one sentence pitch. So why do

214
00:12:36,342 --> 00:12:39,004
this game? Like I said, ideas are easy. I had a million of

215
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,627
them. I've got 300 game ideas on this hard drive right here on

216
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:48,051
this laptop. You need to choose the one that you, the right

217
00:12:48,111 --> 00:12:52,075
idea, okay, from all the ideas you have. Could it be a breakout

218
00:12:52,115 --> 00:12:52,775
commercial hit?

219
00:12:54,456 --> 00:12:56,137
Could it make everybody a fortune?

220
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:57,378
Could it start a series?

221
00:12:57,438 --> 00:12:58,939
Is it something you burn to make?

222
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,202
With Deus Ex, I had no choice, okay?

223
00:13:03,843 --> 00:13:05,804
I had to make that game

224
00:13:05,904 --> 00:13:08,246
or my entire life was going to be a failure.

225
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:12,189
I didn't think about commercial or critical success.

226
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,152
I was gonna find a way to make this game one way or another.

227
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,711
So the third is what are the development challenges? Really hard stuff is fine. I encourage

228
00:13:21,771 --> 00:13:27,812
all of you to tackle really hard problems. But impossible stuff is not so good. In Deus X,

229
00:13:28,032 --> 00:13:33,393
almost everyone thought it was impossible to combine stealth, combat and role playing. I was

230
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:38,174
convinced we could pull all those things off and I was just going to make a team do it. How

231
00:13:38,194 --> 00:13:43,935
well suited to games is the idea. We don't do being very well, okay? At least at the time we

232
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:46,716
didn't. Being in love, we don't do that very well.

233
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:48,980
being amused.

234
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,362
We don't, unless you're Tim Schafer,

235
00:13:50,402 --> 00:13:51,402
we don't do that very well.

236
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:55,926
Games are about doing and about the exploration of spaces

237
00:13:55,946 --> 00:13:57,687
and that's really kind of the heart of Deus Ex.

238
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:00,069
So what's the player fantasy?

239
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:01,671
If the fantasy and the goals aren't there,

240
00:14:01,691 --> 00:14:02,952
it's probably a bad idea.

241
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:07,055
In Deus Ex it was, you're a James Bond figure,

242
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:08,396
at least this is where we started,

243
00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:10,078
who's equally good at fighting,

244
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:11,619
sneaking and charming people,

245
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,660
which is a pretty solid fantasy.

246
00:14:14,804 --> 00:14:21,791
What does the player do? What are the verbs of the game? Games are about doing, like I said. At

247
00:14:21,831 --> 00:14:28,278
some level, if you boil it down, it's about running, jumping, sneaking, talking, fighting,

248
00:14:28,398 --> 00:14:33,463
you know, which are all good, solid game verbs. There was nothing innovative about the verbs of

249
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:37,347
the game. They were just good, solid game verbs. And then we get to the 2 plus 1.

250
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:40,920
Has anyone done this before?

251
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:41,761
Okay.

252
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:44,642
If someone has done it before, what can we learn from them?

253
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:47,844
And if no one's done it before, what does that tell us?

254
00:14:47,904 --> 00:14:49,445
It could be a really bad idea.

255
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:51,266
Okay.

256
00:14:51,527 --> 00:14:53,468
Or it could be so original that it's something

257
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:55,169
that could change the world of gaming.

258
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:56,049
You know, you just don't know,

259
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:57,630
but you need to know if someone's done this before

260
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,291
and think about it.

261
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:01,072
And I knew there had never been a game like Deus Ex.

262
00:15:01,112 --> 00:15:04,554
At least I felt that way in my egotistical world of fantasy.

263
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:08,037
And I was gonna show everybody that they'd missed the boat.

264
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,343
And then what's the one thing?

265
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:14,484
We are a very young medium, even today.

266
00:15:14,524 --> 00:15:16,585
I've been saying this for 30 something years

267
00:15:16,645 --> 00:15:18,065
and it's still freaking true.

268
00:15:18,865 --> 00:15:21,667
Anybody who believes that we've had our Citizen Kane,

269
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:23,747
you know, or whatever, however you want to think about it,

270
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:25,008
is fooling themselves.

271
00:15:25,128 --> 00:15:28,249
We have not done everything games can and should do.

272
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:31,190
And you can always find one thing

273
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,731
that hasn't been done before.

274
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:35,152
Even if you're making a My Little Pony game.

275
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:37,993
You can find, actually, okay, we have some bronies

276
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:38,833
in the audience, great.

277
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:43,615
But you can always find one new thing, okay?

278
00:15:45,216 --> 00:15:47,917
And in Deus Ex, I thought the combination of genres

279
00:15:47,937 --> 00:15:50,018
was gonna be unique, it would result in something unique.

280
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:52,899
And the idea that players could solve problems

281
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,199
the way they wanted to instead of us forcing,

282
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,920
as developers, forcing them to play

283
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,980
the way we wanted them to.

284
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:01,542
And the plus one, this is really important to me,

285
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:02,722
it may or may not be important to you,

286
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,063
but do you have something to say?

287
00:16:06,395 --> 00:16:09,078
There has to be something more, in my opinion, in a game

288
00:16:09,118 --> 00:16:12,381
than what's happening just on the surface level of action.

289
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:14,483
If you don't have something to say,

290
00:16:14,503 --> 00:16:17,405
a theme or an issue you want players to explore,

291
00:16:18,607 --> 00:16:20,448
you are kind of wasting players' time.

292
00:16:21,441 --> 00:16:24,784
and you are wasting your time. I said it. Okay? There you go.

293
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,427
In Deus Ex, I wanted to explore all sorts of big issues, which

294
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:34,471
I will get to shortly. And I wanted players to explore those

295
00:16:34,531 --> 00:16:37,093
things in ways that only games could allow them to do.

296
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:40,577
So luckily, where Deus Ex was concerned,

297
00:16:40,897 --> 00:16:42,038
the answers were yes.

298
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,860
So we started in the concept phase.

299
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:48,962
The first thing that happened was the real world went away

300
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:53,485
because even in 1997, it was just not possible

301
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:54,746
to recreate the real world.

302
00:16:54,826 --> 00:16:56,447
So we moved it out to 2052.

303
00:16:56,507 --> 00:16:58,108
That was one of the first decisions we made.

304
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:00,950
And we had to know what the real world was gonna be like

305
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,211
50 years in the future.

306
00:17:02,991 --> 00:17:04,692
So that led us in a couple of directions.

307
00:17:05,132 --> 00:17:06,852
It led us to cyberpunk fiction,

308
00:17:07,473 --> 00:17:09,913
and it led us to movies like Blade Runner.

309
00:17:10,314 --> 00:17:11,754
But that could only take us so far.

310
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:17,036
So if we were gonna plug into the real cultural zeitgeist,

311
00:17:18,476 --> 00:17:21,637
we had to pay close attention to things in the real world.

312
00:17:22,598 --> 00:17:24,678
So you didn't have to be a genius, even in 1997,

313
00:17:24,858 --> 00:17:29,180
to see that the news was increasingly filled

314
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,360
with reports of terrorism.

315
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:35,480
It wasn't a part of our daily lives at that point, but you could kind of see it coming.

316
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:39,962
If you did a little digging, you started seeing military efforts

317
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:42,003
to create mechanically augmented soldiers.

318
00:17:42,303 --> 00:17:46,064
And we even found real world cloaking devices.

319
00:17:46,644 --> 00:17:49,945
They're kind of faked and phony, but it was still cool.

320
00:17:49,965 --> 00:17:51,606
We could put it in the game because we found that.

321
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,851
AI research had people talking about the singularity.

322
00:17:56,891 --> 00:17:58,092
They're still talking about that.

323
00:17:58,212 --> 00:17:59,372
I'm still thinking about that.

324
00:17:59,852 --> 00:18:01,353
I'm working on System Shock 3 now.

325
00:18:01,393 --> 00:18:03,614
You'll probably think about it again soon.

326
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:08,717
But the point where computer AI overtook human intelligence

327
00:18:08,757 --> 00:18:10,498
was on people's minds back then.

328
00:18:11,698 --> 00:18:12,859
And really interesting to us

329
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:14,620
was the rise of nanotechnology.

330
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:19,298
So the dangers of that seemed like it'd be fun to explore.

331
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,781
But most important, everywhere you looked in 1997,

332
00:18:22,562 --> 00:18:23,723
there was a conspiracy theory.

333
00:18:24,444 --> 00:18:25,064
It was crazy.

334
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:29,109
Black helicopters, men in black, manufactured diseases,

335
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:32,552
you know, sentient AIs, governments serving the needs

336
00:18:32,592 --> 00:18:33,793
of mysterious overlords.

337
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,395
I mean, it was all there, right?

338
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:36,797
And the World Wide Web, I mean,

339
00:18:36,817 --> 00:18:37,998
who knew where that was going to lead?

340
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:45,182
People believed in all that stuff. And the world of Deus Ex was being created all around us. We

341
00:18:45,222 --> 00:18:52,287
didn't have to make anything up. It was great. So here are the things I wanted people thinking

342
00:18:52,327 --> 00:18:56,149
about. I created some pillar questions and every decision that we made on the game was

343
00:18:56,229 --> 00:19:00,652
filtered through this mesh. I already mentioned this. So what would happen if you masked up

344
00:19:00,692 --> 00:19:01,252
these genres?

345
00:19:03,347 --> 00:19:05,669
What would happen if you dropped a James Bond guy who

346
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:08,111
believes in right and wrong and black and white into a world

347
00:19:08,151 --> 00:19:09,392
that's all shades of gray?

348
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:14,916
What would the world be like if every conspiracy theory people

349
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:16,838
believe to be true were, in fact, true?

350
00:19:18,539 --> 00:19:20,461
And what did it mean to be human in a world of

351
00:19:21,141 --> 00:19:22,923
augmentation, mechanical and nano?

352
00:19:25,217 --> 00:19:29,498
And finally, how would the world be better off? This was really important. Would the world be

353
00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:35,001
better off as it really is ruled by a secret cabal, of course? Would it be better off if it

354
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:40,824
was ruled by a sentient AI that connected all of us but cost us our free will? Would it be

355
00:19:40,864 --> 00:19:47,086
better off plunged into a new dark age where free will reigned? Okay. Or would ‑‑

356
00:19:48,862 --> 00:19:50,062
Yeah, anyway, I'll stop there.

357
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:51,523
I got too much to talk about.

358
00:19:51,784 --> 00:19:53,425
The game would have no bosses to kill.

359
00:19:53,585 --> 00:19:55,486
It was gonna be about the fate of the world

360
00:19:55,646 --> 00:19:57,127
and what you believed it should be.

361
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:58,989
Now in a novel or a movie,

362
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:02,991
all you get to do is say, I agree, or I disagree.

363
00:20:03,292 --> 00:20:04,232
You get to interpret.

364
00:20:04,573 --> 00:20:06,894
In a game, I thought, and only in a game,

365
00:20:07,194 --> 00:20:09,196
you could answer those questions for yourself

366
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:10,897
through your play choices.

367
00:20:11,317 --> 00:20:12,798
That was the power of those questions.

368
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:16,111
So I also created a set of commandments,

369
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:18,393
and I encourage you to do this too in your games.

370
00:20:18,413 --> 00:20:20,295
Your teams will appreciate it, I promise you.

371
00:20:21,857 --> 00:20:24,479
These are just the Deus Ex rules of role-playing,

372
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:25,240
basically, right?

373
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,221
Your rules may vary.

374
00:20:27,141 --> 00:20:27,902
Always show the goal.

375
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,905
You should always see what you're trying to accomplish.

376
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:32,927
It's not fun to try to figure out what you have to do.

377
00:20:32,987 --> 00:20:33,828
It's fun doing it.

378
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:35,909
You should show the goal.

379
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:41,850
Problems, not puzzles. It's an obstacle course, not a jigsaw

380
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,292
puzzle. You should never have to read a designer's mind. No

381
00:20:46,372 --> 00:20:49,313
forced failures. Failure is not fun. Getting knocked

382
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:53,195
unconscious and waking up with a smoking gun in your hand and

383
00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:56,096
dead bodies may make for a great story, but it has nothing to do

384
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:58,977
with games. Situations where the player has no chance to react in

385
00:20:59,037 --> 00:21:00,678
the Deus Ex world are bad.

386
00:21:09,382 --> 00:21:13,425
I already said this. It's about playing a role, not about rolling dice. We have better

387
00:21:13,485 --> 00:21:19,229
simulation tools and techniques than Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson had back in the 70s. Why do

388
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:25,353
we still have character classes and skill levels and die rolls? So we were going to try to do

389
00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:31,918
away with that stuff. If something is cool, don't even think about letting an NPC do it.

390
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:36,321
Players do the cool stuff. NPCs watch the player do the cool stuff.

391
00:21:38,459 --> 00:21:41,682
You want constant rewards to drive players onward.

392
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:43,623
You have to reward players regularly.

393
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:48,367
This is genius right here.

394
00:21:48,828 --> 00:21:51,710
As the player gets better, make the game harder.

395
00:21:54,653 --> 00:21:55,574
Think 3D.

396
00:21:55,754 --> 00:21:59,497
I believe that 3D maps can't be laid out on graph paper.

397
00:21:59,737 --> 00:22:01,359
You're more than welcome to disagree with me.

398
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:04,101
But if players aren't looking up and down constantly,

399
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:06,063
you might as well make a 2D game.

400
00:22:08,508 --> 00:22:09,329
And be connected.

401
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:12,010
Tunnels that go from A to B are not very

402
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,030
interesting spaces.

403
00:22:14,011 --> 00:22:17,352
Highly interconnected spaces, horizontally and vertically,

404
00:22:18,492 --> 00:22:19,813
are what are interesting.

405
00:22:19,893 --> 00:22:22,454
Locations that have many entrance and exit points are

406
00:22:22,494 --> 00:22:22,874
interesting.

407
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:24,514
Interconnected spaces are interesting.

408
00:22:26,115 --> 00:22:28,336
And every problem is going to have multiple solutions.

409
00:22:31,403 --> 00:22:36,046
Okay. So I was laying down these filters and commandments and

410
00:22:36,086 --> 00:22:39,048
while that was going on, we did even more conspiracy research.

411
00:22:39,249 --> 00:22:42,711
By the way, Google Denver airport conspiracy, if you want

412
00:22:42,731 --> 00:22:45,193
to see one that was so wacky we couldn't even put it in the

413
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:50,296
game. We're in concept phase. We honed in on what we wanted the

414
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:53,358
game to look like, inspired by movies like Blade Runner.

415
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:55,648
We worked on our back story.

416
00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:57,409
We figured out what was happening in all of these

417
00:22:57,449 --> 00:23:00,450
places, the asteroid belt, and Africa, and Mexico, and all

418
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:02,030
these places you never went in the game.

419
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:04,851
So we could make the places you did visit more believable.

420
00:23:05,832 --> 00:23:09,293
We worked out more than 25 missions all around the world.

421
00:23:09,873 --> 00:23:11,814
The amount of story we planned was insane.

422
00:23:13,034 --> 00:23:15,315
We created over 200 characters before we had a

423
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,336
story, also insane.

424
00:23:18,416 --> 00:23:20,777
But we figured we could build a story around the characters.

425
00:23:21,557 --> 00:23:22,857
Anyway, I don't know what we were thinking.

426
00:23:24,918 --> 00:23:26,840
We ended up with, are you sitting down,

427
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,561
500 pages of documentation.

428
00:23:30,262 --> 00:23:31,782
Yeah, no one read it.

429
00:23:34,224 --> 00:23:36,545
Okay, so concept phase, I'm really gonna have to

430
00:23:36,605 --> 00:23:39,907
rip through this, because I've got another 90 slides

431
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:41,188
to get through.

432
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:42,809
I'm not kidding.

433
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,211
So, concept phase wrapped up,

434
00:23:47,071 --> 00:23:48,392
and we hit it into pre-production,

435
00:23:48,752 --> 00:23:50,253
and at the time when we figured out what game

436
00:23:50,273 --> 00:23:51,154
we were really going to make.

437
00:23:52,034 --> 00:23:58,302
We started prototyping, which I will come back to if I have time. We built a team, went from

438
00:23:58,322 --> 00:24:05,351
being just six people to being about 30. The team, the Deus Ex team was about 30 people.

439
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:09,295
Totally dysfunctional team. We'll get into that a little bit more, too.

440
00:24:11,297 --> 00:24:14,139
So we had about six-ish months of pre-production, which

441
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:17,741
probably wasn't enough, but it was good enough. It got us by.

442
00:24:18,882 --> 00:24:21,843
We cut a bunch of stuff and ended up with 270 pages of

443
00:24:21,903 --> 00:24:25,105
documentation, which nobody read, and we entered production.

444
00:24:25,846 --> 00:24:28,767
It was a grind, just like every project. I mean, I could spend

445
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:32,169
all day just talking about production. But every day we

446
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:34,831
saw our goals being realized.

447
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:37,655
There's a lot more to tell.

448
00:24:37,675 --> 00:24:38,895
I mean, you don't want to know how many times

449
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,136
I was told just make a shooter and I said no.

450
00:24:42,336 --> 00:24:44,057
You don't want to, well, you probably do want to hear,

451
00:24:44,117 --> 00:24:46,798
but anyway, an artist left out the World Trade Center

452
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,378
from the New York City skyline,

453
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:52,799
which was pretty eerie and a totally innocent mistake.

454
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,421
And then there was the day we hit pre-alpha

455
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:59,161
and realized the game was not fun.

456
00:24:59,201 --> 00:24:59,881
That was a good one.

457
00:25:02,622 --> 00:25:06,523
By September 1999, we were done, except we weren't.

458
00:25:07,244 --> 00:25:08,724
The game was not good enough.

459
00:25:08,824 --> 00:25:10,365
It wasn't ready to ship.

460
00:25:11,905 --> 00:25:14,627
September 1999 was really the first time we saw all of our

461
00:25:14,667 --> 00:25:15,807
game systems come together.

462
00:25:15,827 --> 00:25:18,148
And immersive sims come together very late.

463
00:25:18,568 --> 00:25:20,769
And all of your little game systems and rules are all

464
00:25:20,829 --> 00:25:23,951
working together magically to produce this amazing

465
00:25:24,011 --> 00:25:24,551
experience.

466
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:27,132
But if we had shipped then, none of us would be in this

467
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:27,812
room right now.

468
00:25:29,024 --> 00:25:32,665
Luckily, IDOS, our publisher, saw the potential of the game

469
00:25:33,046 --> 00:25:37,988
and gave us more time. So by June of 2000, Deus Ex was in

470
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:42,671
fact ready to ship. It was the game of my dreams. It was done.

471
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:47,654
It was created by an incredibly talented team. Another thing I

472
00:25:47,694 --> 00:25:50,135
always do, it's really crazy, but I close my eyes when I'm

473
00:25:50,195 --> 00:25:52,956
starting a game and I imagine what it's going to look like. I

474
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:55,097
mean, I literally close my eyes and sit there and imagine.

475
00:25:56,095 --> 00:26:01,217
and three years later, there it was. Every single detail had

476
00:26:01,257 --> 00:26:05,999
changed. Every single detail. But in spirit, it was exactly

477
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:09,240
the game I hoped we would make, which was kind of amazing. The

478
00:26:09,281 --> 00:26:10,261
only time that's ever happened.

479
00:26:11,199 --> 00:26:12,240
But I was terrified.

480
00:26:13,141 --> 00:26:15,303
Right before we shipped, I put my head down on my desk

481
00:26:15,343 --> 00:26:19,908
and I just said, if people get that you can fight,

482
00:26:19,988 --> 00:26:22,171
sneak, or talk, we're gonna rule the world.

483
00:26:22,851 --> 00:26:25,654
If people compare our combat to Half-Life, we're dead.

484
00:26:26,095 --> 00:26:28,878
If people compare our sneaking to Thief, we're dead.

485
00:26:28,918 --> 00:26:30,500
And if people compare our role-playing elements

486
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,981
to Baldur's Gate, we're dead.

487
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:35,203
There was just no telling how it was going to go.

488
00:26:35,604 --> 00:26:37,144
But there was also nothing anybody could do.

489
00:26:37,245 --> 00:26:40,486
We shipped the game, and we'd soon know how people responded.

490
00:26:40,526 --> 00:26:42,868
And I'll try to get to that here today.

491
00:26:43,628 --> 00:26:46,470
So let me kind of rip through what we did right and wrong.

492
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:50,472
It's ironic, because we made a game where there was no right

493
00:26:50,512 --> 00:26:52,854
and wrong, and yet plenty went right and wrong in the

494
00:26:52,894 --> 00:26:53,714
development, I'll tell you.

495
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,925
So what went right? We had a clear high-level vision. I've already talked a little bit about that.

496
00:27:00,626 --> 00:27:03,949
We knew what game we wanted to make, or at least what kind of game we wanted to make.

497
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:09,334
It was a natural outgrowth of games from companies like this.

498
00:27:10,415 --> 00:27:12,457
We built on a foundation that already existed.

499
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,551
As you know, it was a game I had been thinking about for

500
00:27:16,591 --> 00:27:17,211
many years.

501
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:18,992
So it didn't come out of nowhere.

502
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,973
We had a good idea of what game we wanted to make.

503
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:24,654
So the lesson here is if there's a game that you have

504
00:27:24,694 --> 00:27:25,875
to make, never give up.

505
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,876
Because someone's going to be stupid enough to give you the

506
00:27:27,916 --> 00:27:28,536
money someday.

507
00:27:31,767 --> 00:27:37,508
We had very clear goals. Those commandments, they were a great start. But we had to move from

508
00:27:37,648 --> 00:27:42,369
abstract ideas to game design specifics. We had to start thinking about what players wanted to

509
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:48,891
do and not what we wanted to do. So what were our goals? We wanted players thinking about who

510
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:54,972
they were in the world. Character differentiation, totally important. We wanted players to

511
00:27:54,992 --> 00:27:56,653
think how they wanted to behave in the world.

512
00:27:57,915 --> 00:28:02,639
We had to wean players from traditional games, puzzle games and fighting games to games where

513
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:10,006
they actually had to, I don't know what's the word, think. God, I have an attitude. We wanted a

514
00:28:10,046 --> 00:28:16,512
game that tuned itself to each player's play style. Rather than forcing players to play the

515
00:28:16,552 --> 00:28:17,733
way we wanted them to play.

516
00:28:18,878 --> 00:28:22,321
We wanted them to feel like they were actually in the world.

517
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:24,483
They needed to be able to apply real world logic

518
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:25,664
to the problems in the game.

519
00:28:26,465 --> 00:28:27,966
And everything in the game had to be based

520
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:28,687
on something real.

521
00:28:28,767 --> 00:28:32,030
I'm sure if there's anybody who worked on Deus Ex

522
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,452
in this audience, I'm sure you hate me

523
00:28:34,693 --> 00:28:38,196
because I made everybody base stuff on real stuff.

524
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,839
And could we put players in control of the experience?

525
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:44,401
If not, Deus Ex was gonna be a failed experiment.

526
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:50,054
The third thing that went right, we didn't skimp on pre-production. I said we had six months.

527
00:28:50,414 --> 00:28:57,157
You can always use more, okay? But we did okay. We started out with that team of six figuring

528
00:28:57,237 --> 00:29:04,081
out what game we wanted to make. We started working out our missions, way too many of them.

529
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:08,783
I'll come back to this in a minute. We hammered on our game systems.

530
00:29:11,002 --> 00:29:12,263
But here's the thing.

531
00:29:12,423 --> 00:29:14,124
I have two number threes.

532
00:29:14,144 --> 00:29:14,564
Look at that.

533
00:29:16,806 --> 00:29:18,347
I needed more pre-production on this deck.

534
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:23,371
By March of 1998, we thought we knew everything we needed to

535
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:25,533
know to make a game, but man, were we wrong.

536
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:27,794
We were open to change.

537
00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:28,815
Be open to change.

538
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:31,177
Anybody who tells you that when you get to the end of

539
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:34,039
pre-production, you've got a script and nothing changes has

540
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:35,280
never made a game, right?

541
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,021
And it's usually going to be someone wearing a suit.

542
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:38,062
Don't let them get away with it.

543
00:29:40,084 --> 00:29:41,127
So why did things change?

544
00:29:41,528 --> 00:29:43,072
Well, we had new people join the team.

545
00:29:43,132 --> 00:29:44,195
They had new ideas.

546
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:47,042
as we brought on new people,

547
00:29:47,362 --> 00:29:50,524
we found ourselves with a team of hardcore shooter players,

548
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:53,747
Ultima fans, RTS players, I mean, it was crazy.

549
00:29:55,388 --> 00:29:57,529
And it was my job and my lead's team's job

550
00:29:57,849 --> 00:30:01,912
to kind of manage that, the conflicts that raged

551
00:30:02,072 --> 00:30:03,273
over the kinds of games

552
00:30:03,313 --> 00:30:04,854
that all those new people wanted to make.

553
00:30:05,355 --> 00:30:06,675
By the way, if whoever made this diagram

554
00:30:06,695 --> 00:30:08,157
is in the audience, I'm sorry, I stole it.

555
00:30:10,296 --> 00:30:14,543
Our game systems didn't work as well in reality as we

556
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:16,426
thought they would on paper, or as I thought

557
00:30:16,446 --> 00:30:17,147
they would on paper.

558
00:30:19,213 --> 00:30:22,756
Another thing we did right was we always had a playable build.

559
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,198
Again, this is like common practice now.

560
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:28,860
We always knew where we were, even if that was painful.

561
00:30:30,301 --> 00:30:33,823
Proto missions, critical to all of our scheduling and the

562
00:30:33,843 --> 00:30:34,884
quality of the final game.

563
00:30:36,105 --> 00:30:39,387
The first one we built was a White House mission, which we

564
00:30:39,427 --> 00:30:40,408
ended up having to cut.

565
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,570
But that mission showed the potential of the game.

566
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,431
We hacked in everything that we knew we

567
00:30:45,491 --> 00:30:46,412
wanted the player to do.

568
00:30:46,432 --> 00:30:47,973
It was totally hacked.

569
00:30:49,174 --> 00:30:51,595
And we saw a bunch of stuff that didn't work.

570
00:30:51,635 --> 00:30:53,296
That's the power of proto missions,

571
00:30:53,716 --> 00:30:54,857
as we called them back then.

572
00:30:55,697 --> 00:30:56,938
Our performance was abysmal.

573
00:30:57,678 --> 00:31:01,040
We knew we'd have to cut our maps up into smaller chunks.

574
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,021
The skill system that I came up with,

575
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:05,042
this is when I got the first inkling

576
00:31:05,062 --> 00:31:07,063
that it wasn't actually going to be any fun.

577
00:31:07,844 --> 00:31:10,405
I was too stubborn to cut it at that point or change it,

578
00:31:10,505 --> 00:31:12,266
but we got a sense that AI

579
00:31:12,306 --> 00:31:13,847
was gonna be a big challenge for us.

580
00:31:15,893 --> 00:31:19,876
And then shortly after that, actually it was almost a year

581
00:31:19,976 --> 00:31:22,938
after that, we had some real missions built.

582
00:31:23,198 --> 00:31:25,980
And we let real people play the game.

583
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,381
You could do everything you were going to do in the game.

584
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:29,642
And it really wasn't hacked.

585
00:31:30,183 --> 00:31:32,244
It was as documented, but not hacked.

586
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:35,166
And we let real people come in and play the game.

587
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,947
Do not tell your publisher you're doing this.

588
00:31:39,757 --> 00:31:43,001
We needed the opinions of people who understood our kind

589
00:31:43,021 --> 00:31:46,505
of game and the development process better than we did.

590
00:31:46,966 --> 00:31:48,748
So we had real people come in and play the game.

591
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:51,671
And listening to their responses, I called that

592
00:31:51,771 --> 00:31:54,895
particular milestone the wow, these missions suck milestone.

593
00:31:56,803 --> 00:32:03,348
We had a lot of work to do. We had potential. Everybody saw that. But we had a lot of work to

594
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:09,613
do. So we ended up cutting and cutting and cutting. We had too much game. Harvey Smith, the

595
00:32:09,633 --> 00:32:17,259
lead designer, had been telling me stop being a kitchen sink designer and cut stuff. And I'll

596
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:20,582
come back to that, too. We licensed tech. That was something we did right. We used Unreal

597
00:32:20,602 --> 00:32:23,804
to make a tournament. And for the most part, it worked out really well.

598
00:32:25,797 --> 00:32:28,438
Adding what we needed was much easier than it could have been.

599
00:32:29,398 --> 00:32:30,959
Unreal Ed was really powerful,

600
00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:32,780
superior to anything else at the time.

601
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,261
Unreal Script allowed programmers to do lots

602
00:32:35,281 --> 00:32:37,062
of interesting things easily and quickly.

603
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:42,284
That's my entire programming team, plus one of the testers.

604
00:32:43,725 --> 00:32:45,386
Three programmers made Deus Ex.

605
00:32:45,766 --> 00:32:46,767
They were very overworked.

606
00:32:48,028 --> 00:32:50,130
but they were able to do it because we licensed stuff.

607
00:32:50,791 --> 00:32:51,912
So what went wrong?

608
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:53,253
All sorts of stuff.

609
00:32:53,654 --> 00:32:55,576
Team structure did not work.

610
00:32:55,596 --> 00:33:01,682
I had two people qualified to be lead designers,

611
00:33:01,722 --> 00:33:02,763
so instead of picking one,

612
00:33:02,803 --> 00:33:04,225
I said you're both lead designers,

613
00:33:04,505 --> 00:33:06,367
I'm gonna give you both your own design team.

614
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:08,670
Don't do that.

615
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,911
I thought I could manage the tension

616
00:33:09,951 --> 00:33:12,334
between the immersive sim guys and the Ultima guys.

617
00:33:13,655 --> 00:33:15,337
And what ended up happening was that

618
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:18,601
I had to call one of the design teams one

619
00:33:18,781 --> 00:33:22,145
and the other one A, because neither would be B or two.

620
00:33:25,629 --> 00:33:26,750
Yeah, yeah.

621
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:35,707
So, eventually I had to just say one of you is the lead designer, a couple people left, it was very sad, but it was the right thing for the game.

622
00:33:36,727 --> 00:33:44,588
On the art side, we also had problems because the artists at first, for about the first year of the project, actually reported to a guy in Dallas, not to me.

623
00:33:45,388 --> 00:33:51,469
And I argued and screamed about matrix management not working, and ultimately I won and the artists ended up reporting to me.

624
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:57,130
And I can only imagine what the game might have looked like if the artists had reported to me from the start. That would have been interesting.

625
00:33:58,117 --> 00:34:02,881
One of the things I probably should have talked about that I did right was I had the right

626
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:03,461
leads team.

627
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:07,765
That's Chris Norton in the middle, Harvey Smith on the left, and Jay Lee on the right.

628
00:34:08,245 --> 00:34:12,668
Lead designer, lead programmer and assistant director, and art director.

629
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:18,113
Those guys do not get enough credit for the creative aspects of the game, the fact that

630
00:34:18,133 --> 00:34:20,355
we shipped it all, and managing the team.

631
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:23,097
So give those guys their due.

632
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,163
Yeah, people think I make games,

633
00:34:29,183 --> 00:34:31,164
they like pour out of my forehead, you know,

634
00:34:31,385 --> 00:34:33,707
like, I don't know, like I bang my head on a desk

635
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,969
and blood pours out or something.

636
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:39,532
So the lesson learned here, have a great leads group

637
00:34:40,853 --> 00:34:43,475
and don't underestimate the importance of team dynamics.

638
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:48,543
Okay. Another thing that went wrong was our goals were too

639
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:51,044
big. We weren't realistic. If you're going to advance the

640
00:34:51,084 --> 00:34:54,286
state of the art, and I hope you all try to do that, you have to

641
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:58,148
think big. But you really don't want to create missions, which I

642
00:34:58,248 --> 00:35:01,270
did, by the way. I have to take responsibility for. You're going

643
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,452
to liberate 2,000 people from a concentration camp in the

644
00:35:05,492 --> 00:35:06,993
Midwest. Don't do that.

645
00:35:07,473 --> 00:35:14,837
Okay, there's going to be a full-on war between the Russo-Mexican alliance and the United States government in Austin, Texas

646
00:35:15,477 --> 00:35:17,018
Don't do that. Okay

647
00:35:18,538 --> 00:35:23,341
Harvey Smith and another designer Steve Powers came to me one day and said you cannot make this game

648
00:35:24,201 --> 00:35:31,263
We cannot tell this story and they browbeat me until I gave in and we cut a bunch and the game was better for it.

649
00:35:31,743 --> 00:35:36,985
So define your creative box, define it by the limit according to the limitations of your tech

650
00:35:37,785 --> 00:35:40,186
and also by the limitations of what's right for your game.

651
00:35:40,466 --> 00:35:45,368
Okay, the job of the creative director, the game director on the game is to define the

652
00:35:45,408 --> 00:35:50,369
creative limits and then make sure the entire team is within it. It is not to say make that pixel blue not green.

653
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:51,430
Okay.

654
00:35:53,384 --> 00:35:55,026
We didn't front load enough of our risks.

655
00:35:56,226 --> 00:35:57,427
We did a bunch of prototyping,

656
00:35:57,928 --> 00:36:01,690
but we ended up with systems that didn't work,

657
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,833
with AI that was created in a vacuum

658
00:36:05,893 --> 00:36:08,635
rather than designed to work with all of our game systems

659
00:36:08,675 --> 00:36:10,216
in our story, it was a big problem.

660
00:36:11,977 --> 00:36:13,718
We ended up with some pretty compelling AI,

661
00:36:13,898 --> 00:36:17,521
but it was inconsistent, let's just say,

662
00:36:17,561 --> 00:36:20,963
in delivering the promise of human behavior.

663
00:36:23,082 --> 00:36:27,984
Oh, wait, I said this was something we did right. It was also something we did wrong. It took us

664
00:36:28,084 --> 00:36:32,467
time to become familiar with the engine. And we never knew it as well as we would have if we

665
00:36:32,487 --> 00:36:37,809
built something ourselves. It took us months of playing with Unreal Tournament before we

666
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:43,792
understood it well enough to work with it. The sim, I mean, Unreal Tournament was not designed

667
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:49,455
to have a deep sim and allow fighting, sneaking and talking. We had to layer all that stuff in

668
00:36:49,515 --> 00:36:49,935
on top.

669
00:36:50,938 --> 00:36:55,441
It worked, but we ended up faking a lot of stuff, just to

670
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:56,922
be frank.

671
00:36:57,022 --> 00:36:59,503
Deus Ex, there's a lot of smoke and mirrors going on

672
00:36:59,543 --> 00:37:00,744
that we didn't actually want.

673
00:37:00,784 --> 00:37:04,006
We wanted to be more real in our simulation-driven game.

674
00:37:06,188 --> 00:37:07,849
We wanted big outdoor areas.

675
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,710
The tech was not up to it.

676
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:12,752
We had to break things up into smaller areas, which actually

677
00:37:12,792 --> 00:37:13,773
did hurt the game some.

678
00:37:18,632 --> 00:37:19,793
I don't remember what I was going to say here.

679
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:20,753
Okay.

680
00:37:22,054 --> 00:37:23,275
I guess for the most part,

681
00:37:23,395 --> 00:37:25,016
using licensed tech is a good thing

682
00:37:25,096 --> 00:37:27,157
because I've used licensed tech on every project

683
00:37:27,177 --> 00:37:27,918
I've done since.

684
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:31,120
And it was a mixed blessing.

685
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,160
That's I guess the bottom line.

686
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:34,542
We also realized,

687
00:37:34,562 --> 00:37:35,262
I've already talked about this,

688
00:37:35,282 --> 00:37:36,103
so I'm going to zip through this,

689
00:37:36,243 --> 00:37:40,345
but Deus Ex just became less realistic as time went on

690
00:37:40,445 --> 00:37:42,407
because it was a mistake to try to recreate

691
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,127
the real world in 1997.

692
00:37:44,188 --> 00:37:45,288
Maybe today you could do it.

693
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,042
But we had no way of living up to people's expectations. This is the interior of the statue of

694
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:55,946
liberty. It looks nothing like the statue of liberty. That's not what the statue looks like.

695
00:37:55,986 --> 00:38:01,890
I've been there. Population density and object density, we could not come close to

696
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:06,753
recreating the real world. We couldn't make people behave like people. We couldn't

697
00:38:07,113 --> 00:38:09,435
simulate a freaking telephone.

698
00:38:10,523 --> 00:38:15,229
in ways that people would believe. So the game became less and less realistic as time went on.

699
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:17,851
And then there was the stuff that was out of our control.

700
00:38:19,995 --> 00:38:21,655
Ion Storm was not a quiet company.

701
00:38:21,695 --> 00:38:23,096
I don't know how many of you remember this.

702
00:38:24,156 --> 00:38:27,418
At least the Dallas office screamed a lot.

703
00:38:27,618 --> 00:38:28,798
There were ads like this.

704
00:38:30,299 --> 00:38:31,739
That was the company motto.

705
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,541
Our emails got leaked and printed in the newspaper,

706
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:37,422
including my salary negotiations.

707
00:38:37,462 --> 00:38:38,062
That's a trip.

708
00:38:38,562 --> 00:38:40,463
Playboy shoots happened in the office.

709
00:38:41,503 --> 00:38:44,184
We had elaborate ship parties before games shipped.

710
00:38:44,264 --> 00:38:46,305
It was very, yeah, it was good.

711
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,367
But let me be clear, let me be clear, two things.

712
00:38:50,427 --> 00:38:52,908
First of all, Ion Austin was an oasis of calm.

713
00:38:52,968 --> 00:38:55,990
And second, John Romero is one of the greatest people

714
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,991
in the game business, okay?

715
00:38:58,051 --> 00:38:59,972
He lived up to every promise he made to me,

716
00:39:00,692 --> 00:39:02,953
and he loves games more than anybody in this room.

717
00:39:03,093 --> 00:39:04,534
So I don't want anybody thinking

718
00:39:04,554 --> 00:39:06,495
I'm dissing on John Romero, all right?

719
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:14,761
But all that stuff had an effect on the Austin team.

720
00:39:14,881 --> 00:39:17,062
I mean, it's hard to be focused and productive

721
00:39:17,182 --> 00:39:19,903
when everybody is screaming negative things

722
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:20,663
about your company.

723
00:39:21,723 --> 00:39:24,884
So finally, I'm a little over time.

724
00:39:25,245 --> 00:39:26,125
Oh well, too bad.

725
00:39:28,426 --> 00:39:29,406
I'm not good with schedules.

726
00:39:32,527 --> 00:39:33,647
So how did people respond?

727
00:39:33,667 --> 00:39:34,788
I said I was gonna get back to that.

728
00:39:35,088 --> 00:39:36,768
Did we get killed or did we rule the world?

729
00:39:38,857 --> 00:39:39,617
Well, we didn't die.

730
00:39:40,198 --> 00:39:41,198
So that tells you something.

731
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:43,498
And we reviewed really well and won a bunch of awards

732
00:39:43,538 --> 00:39:43,998
and all that.

733
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:47,939
But we were surprised by a lot of what players did.

734
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:52,280
Even seasoned gamers were paralyzed by choice.

735
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,200
It was strange.

736
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,281
When they would get to a choice point early on

737
00:39:56,301 --> 00:40:00,481
in our testing, and I would see gamers push the keyboard

738
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:04,182
away and like go, wait, I have to make a real choice?

739
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:06,823
Games had trained people not to think.

740
00:40:06,883 --> 00:40:08,143
It was unbelievable to me.

741
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,062
And what I expected was that players were going to find a play style.

742
00:40:14,082 --> 00:40:16,064
They were going to say, I like fighting or I like sneaking.

743
00:40:16,084 --> 00:40:17,184
And they just play that way.

744
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:18,966
But that's not what happened.

745
00:40:19,286 --> 00:40:23,769
What happened instead was players would get to a choice point, save the game, try something,

746
00:40:24,449 --> 00:40:27,491
go back to the save game, try something different, go back to the save game,

747
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:30,373
try something different, and then pick the one they liked the best.

748
00:40:31,394 --> 00:40:37,397
It was very frustrating, but then you know once people buy your game. It's their game, so you can't be too upset about that

749
00:40:38,738 --> 00:40:44,741
But we did discover that players could interact with our simulation as shallow as it was in a lot of ways and do things that

750
00:40:44,801 --> 00:40:45,642
We didn't expect

751
00:40:47,423 --> 00:40:49,544
Everybody knows the lamb ladder story, right?

752
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:56,388
I mean people would take a light attack munition put it on a wall jump on it put another one higher up jump on it

753
00:40:56,468 --> 00:40:58,409
Put another one higher up jump on it and

754
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,733
they could get out of the world.

755
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:05,237
So if you go do this in Deus Ex,

756
00:41:05,277 --> 00:41:07,460
on a lot of maps you'll find ladders

757
00:41:07,881 --> 00:41:09,843
and crates outside of the map,

758
00:41:10,444 --> 00:41:11,906
so you can actually stack them up

759
00:41:11,946 --> 00:41:13,027
and get back in the game world.

760
00:41:15,526 --> 00:41:19,629
Yeah. There was a time about a year after we shipped, I saw

761
00:41:19,689 --> 00:41:23,751
somebody in a place I had played myself a hundred times and

762
00:41:23,932 --> 00:41:28,995
watched people play a thousand times, and there was a guard

763
00:41:29,055 --> 00:41:31,876
standing there in front of an open doorway with laser

764
00:41:31,936 --> 00:41:35,439
triggers that would set off an alarm and two guys on patrols

765
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:39,141
on the other side of the door. It was three problems, okay? And

766
00:41:39,181 --> 00:41:42,223
I watched this one guy sneaking around, moving explosive

767
00:41:42,243 --> 00:41:43,123
barrels around.

768
00:41:43,724 --> 00:41:47,134
He took one shot with the pistol and solved all three problems at once.

769
00:41:48,277 --> 00:41:49,701
And I fell on the floor.

770
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,182
And I guarantee you, no one else in the world

771
00:41:53,222 --> 00:41:55,364
had ever done that before.

772
00:41:55,764 --> 00:41:56,444
That was cool.

773
00:41:57,105 --> 00:41:59,307
Seeing people actually doing things that were not

774
00:41:59,387 --> 00:42:02,550
anticipated was cool and was one of our measures of success.

775
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,472
By the way, know how you are going to define success

776
00:42:05,512 --> 00:42:06,493
in any game you make.

777
00:42:06,553 --> 00:42:08,575
If you can't define success, you are not

778
00:42:08,675 --> 00:42:10,516
ready to make that game.

779
00:42:11,017 --> 00:42:13,739
So conversation was my definition of success.

780
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:21,030
wasn't it cool I would hear someone say when you rescued

781
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,732
that prisoner from the cells under UNATCO headquarters and

782
00:42:23,772 --> 00:42:28,936
someone else would say what cells? That was a win. I used to

783
00:42:28,976 --> 00:42:32,339
say all the time I love the pistol and the team wanted to

784
00:42:32,379 --> 00:42:34,600
cut the pistol because it was the weakest weapon in the game.

785
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,222
It's like, no, don't cut the pistol. I love it. It makes me

786
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:39,024
think. It's my favorite weapon.

787
00:42:40,415 --> 00:42:44,719
There was another time, I was at an event like this, actually,

788
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:47,442
and after the talk, I went out, I never do this, I went out for

789
00:42:47,502 --> 00:42:50,044
drinks with some people in the audience, do not ask me, I won't

790
00:42:50,084 --> 00:42:50,284
do it.

791
00:42:50,923 --> 00:42:55,705
But an inebriated fan sat down next to me and said,

792
00:42:55,745 --> 00:42:58,446
how can you make that right wing piece of trash?

793
00:42:59,026 --> 00:43:00,286
And before I could answer,

794
00:43:00,487 --> 00:43:01,687
I don't do a good drunk imitation.

795
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:05,909
And then another drunk fan sat down on the other side

796
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:07,969
and said, what do you mean right wing piece of trash?

797
00:43:08,009 --> 00:43:10,010
It was left wing propaganda from the start.

798
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:13,351
And the cool thing was they were both right, okay.

799
00:43:14,272 --> 00:43:15,612
Based on how they had played the game

800
00:43:15,632 --> 00:43:17,493
and the end games that they had selected and everything.

801
00:43:17,713 --> 00:43:19,554
And I just got up and left them to argue.

802
00:43:19,694 --> 00:43:20,234
It was awesome.

803
00:43:22,758 --> 00:43:25,460
So instead of talking about how they killed the final boss or

804
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:29,142
saved the princess, they talked about the fate of the world.

805
00:43:29,363 --> 00:43:32,865
That was success. That was exactly what I wanted them

806
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:38,228
doing. So that was what Deus Ex was all about. It wasn't about

807
00:43:38,808 --> 00:43:40,750
what the development team thought the world should be. It

808
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:44,872
was about what you, not your avatar, not the character, what

809
00:43:44,912 --> 00:43:46,013
you thought the world should be.

810
00:43:48,227 --> 00:43:52,332
So, like Bruce Sterling and every other D&D dungeon master,

811
00:43:52,432 --> 00:43:54,614
we provided the skeleton of the experience.

812
00:43:55,315 --> 00:43:58,399
And players put the meat on the bones, okay?

813
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:01,122
There was one guy, okay, I was at GDC,

814
00:44:01,342 --> 00:44:02,644
this was several years ago,

815
00:44:03,605 --> 00:44:06,168
and a guy came up to me dressed as JC Denton.

816
00:44:06,908 --> 00:44:12,913
okay? And he was German and I will not try and do a German accent, but he said, I've played

817
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:19,638
through Deus Ex 63 times and had a different experience every time. And I pushed him on it and

818
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:24,662
I said, it's not bad. And he said, no, I've played through it 63 times. And then he said words

819
00:44:24,702 --> 00:44:30,926
that were magic to my ears. I am going back to Germany after this show. And I was grateful

820
00:44:30,966 --> 00:44:33,688
because I really don't want to be on the same continent with that guy.

821
00:44:37,894 --> 00:44:42,796
So in the end, Deus Ex was, as all cyberpunk fiction is,

822
00:44:43,617 --> 00:44:45,778
about you and me and the future as it might be.

823
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,959
No aliens, no teleporters, no demons.

824
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,661
Just people and politics and business

825
00:44:52,021 --> 00:44:53,922
and stuff that's usually beyond our control.

826
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:57,687
But in the game world, you could actually make a difference

827
00:44:57,747 --> 00:44:59,347
and remake the world in your image.

828
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:00,908
That was what Deus Ex was about.

829
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,869
It was a powerful idea, at least to me,

830
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:05,570
and I think it's at least in part responsible

831
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:07,231
for the fact that all of you are here today.

832
00:45:08,971 --> 00:45:12,773
So that's the really quick version of a very long talk.

833
00:45:13,953 --> 00:45:16,194
But here's my final thought for all of you.

834
00:45:16,675 --> 00:45:18,535
I sincerely hope that every one of you

835
00:45:18,575 --> 00:45:20,196
gets an opportunity to work on the game

836
00:45:20,236 --> 00:45:22,237
of your dreams someday, okay?

837
00:45:22,797 --> 00:45:24,038
It's amazing.

838
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:31,724
And I also hope that every one of you gets to work on something that is still relevant 17 years after you make it.

839
00:45:32,144 --> 00:45:35,326
And that has a life of its own beyond you.

840
00:45:35,407 --> 00:45:38,809
People ask me all the time how I feel about the new Deus Ex games.

841
00:45:39,129 --> 00:45:41,571
And all I can tell them is, it's amazing.

842
00:45:42,412 --> 00:45:46,235
It's amazing because it has a life beyond me, it has a life beyond my team.

843
00:45:48,237 --> 00:45:50,318
It's bigger than we were.

844
00:45:50,518 --> 00:45:52,980
And I get to play Deus Ex games where I don't know all the secrets.

845
00:45:54,092 --> 00:45:55,052
So thanks for listening.

846
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:56,333
That's what I got.

847
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:06,541
And thanks to the GDC folks for letting me go eight minutes

848
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:09,083
over, fill out your questionnaires or whatever

849
00:46:09,123 --> 00:46:11,204
those things are online.

850
00:46:11,845 --> 00:46:14,406
And if you have questions or something, we ran out of time.

851
00:46:15,547 --> 00:46:18,850
And I can stay out in the hallway or go somewhere if you

852
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:20,091
want to ask some questions for a little while.

853
00:46:22,672 --> 00:46:23,013
What's that?

854
00:46:24,754 --> 00:46:37,423
I can't hear you. I'm sorry. What time is it? Dude, why did I rush through this? I totally rushed

855
00:46:37,463 --> 00:46:43,547
through the last half of this thing. Okay. Any questions?

856
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:54,366
No question? Oh wait, we have a question.

857
00:46:54,446 --> 00:46:56,447
Say your name and who you are.

858
00:46:56,607 --> 00:46:57,967
My name is Mitchell Sabag,

859
00:46:58,307 --> 00:47:02,049
and I recently presented a post-audit narrative summit

860
00:47:02,169 --> 00:47:03,390
on Thief the Dark Project.

861
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:06,211
So I found that talk of yours

862
00:47:06,251 --> 00:47:09,033
to be incredibly insightful and affection.

863
00:47:09,673 --> 00:47:15,876
Now, with regards to how you were faced with limitations

864
00:47:15,936 --> 00:47:17,397
with regards to your design,

865
00:47:17,837 --> 00:47:19,938
and how you had to essentially craft your game

866
00:47:19,978 --> 00:47:20,958
through subtraction.

867
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:32,127
How did you approach designing these small maps around the various player personalities

868
00:47:32,187 --> 00:47:35,629
like explorers, adventurers, killers, etc.?

869
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:42,834
And how did this come about given the limitations and coordination between the various teams?

870
00:47:45,419 --> 00:47:47,080
Realistically, like I said, there was a lot of smoke

871
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:49,041
and mirrors going on in Deus Ex.

872
00:47:49,101 --> 00:47:52,343
We, like I said, our simulation was just deep enough

873
00:47:52,363 --> 00:47:55,565
that players to this day actually still find solutions

874
00:47:55,585 --> 00:47:56,965
to problems that we didn't plan.

875
00:47:57,606 --> 00:48:00,768
But the team, the design team,

876
00:48:00,828 --> 00:48:03,749
and I feel bad for those guys even now

877
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:09,192
because every map had, or every problem and challenge had

878
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:12,663
a sneaky path and a combat path

879
00:48:13,284 --> 00:48:17,887
and a sort of a character interaction path.

880
00:48:18,787 --> 00:48:22,690
So that was, we had to make sure that there was a way

881
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:24,571
to play through it for every play style.

882
00:48:24,952 --> 00:48:27,673
And then we counted on players finding other solutions

883
00:48:27,753 --> 00:48:29,034
beyond that, okay?

884
00:48:29,054 --> 00:48:31,876
I'm not sure if that answered your question,

885
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:36,239
but that was, we just pre-planned some paths

886
00:48:36,299 --> 00:48:36,820
through the game.

887
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,881
No, I think that perfectly explains it.

888
00:48:41,681 --> 00:48:42,521
Thank you very much.

889
00:48:42,661 --> 00:48:43,522
You are very welcome.

890
00:48:46,343 --> 00:48:48,483
Hi, oh wait, let me go over to the other side.

891
00:48:48,744 --> 00:48:50,184
Okay, name and who you are.

892
00:48:50,604 --> 00:48:52,025
Hi, my name's Amir Rajan.

893
00:48:52,545 --> 00:48:54,666
I'm actually an indie game developer.

894
00:48:54,706 --> 00:48:56,686
I'm lucky enough to be able to do this full time.

895
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:04,341
And you mentioned that your games need to have some sort of message or you want to say something through your games.

896
00:49:05,261 --> 00:49:12,284
Could you expand on that a little bit, primarily from the perspective of maybe a large swath of genres of games,

897
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:16,805
some of them are super casual versus mid-core versus very hardcore games?

898
00:49:18,717 --> 00:49:22,418
what does it mean to say something when it's not full of narrative?

899
00:49:22,558 --> 00:49:27,380
Yeah, okay. I think I perhaps overstated to make my point.

900
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:27,640
I mean...

901
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,720
Oh, I agree with you, don't worry.

902
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:34,322
I'm obsessing right now about a game called, you know, 100 with an exclamation point after it.

903
00:49:35,742 --> 00:49:37,583
It doesn't need a message, okay?

904
00:49:37,723 --> 00:49:44,685
But a game that has a narrative or even one that has...

905
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:47,290
I'm trying not to name names.

906
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:48,210
Name them.

907
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:49,650
It's so tempting.

908
00:49:51,251 --> 00:49:57,952
But any game that has any kind of narrative, however deep, can actually ask players to think about something.

909
00:49:59,472 --> 00:50:06,433
In Epic Mickey, for example, I doubt anybody even knows this, at least consciously,

910
00:50:06,493 --> 00:50:09,434
but for me the game was about how important are family and friends to you.

911
00:50:10,714 --> 00:50:13,555
Not family and friends are important in a movie or a book.

912
00:50:15,127 --> 00:50:17,949
the theme, which you don't want players thinking,

913
00:50:17,969 --> 00:50:19,751
or I mean readers thinking about your theme,

914
00:50:19,771 --> 00:50:22,713
you want them kind of ingesting it subconsciously.

915
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,834
And in a game, it's kind of the same thing.

916
00:50:24,894 --> 00:50:26,495
You want them ingesting it subconsciously.

917
00:50:27,036 --> 00:50:29,878
But games ask questions.

918
00:50:30,858 --> 00:50:35,682
Movies and books and opera, they make statements.

919
00:50:36,362 --> 00:50:38,403
Family and friends are important is very different

920
00:50:38,503 --> 00:50:41,345
than how important are family and friends to you.

921
00:50:43,347 --> 00:50:51,220
and is it better to be more powerful and alone or less powerful with friends who will help you?

922
00:50:51,902 --> 00:50:54,346
What does it mean to be forgotten and rejected?

923
00:50:55,054 --> 00:50:55,915
How does that feel?

924
00:50:57,075 --> 00:50:59,657
So even a Mickey Mouse game can ask questions like that.

925
00:50:59,917 --> 00:51:01,838
And if you think about it in terms of questions,

926
00:51:02,739 --> 00:51:05,601
and then create game systems and gameplay

927
00:51:05,641 --> 00:51:07,662
that allow players to explore those questions

928
00:51:08,063 --> 00:51:10,684
in subtle, subconscious ways,

929
00:51:11,785 --> 00:51:13,786
I think games can actually be

930
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:16,528
an even more remarkable medium than we are.

931
00:51:16,548 --> 00:51:18,049
Thank you.

932
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:19,650
Yeah.

933
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:20,491
Hi, my name's Pete.

934
00:51:21,151 --> 00:51:22,652
My voice is a little broken because GDC.

935
00:51:24,604 --> 00:51:28,946
So one question, I have a two-part question. The first part is something that's bothered me for 17 years.

936
00:51:29,326 --> 00:51:29,846
Oh God.

937
00:51:30,207 --> 00:51:31,927
What does JC stand for?

938
00:51:34,048 --> 00:51:35,189
It stands for Jesus Christ.

939
00:51:35,809 --> 00:51:37,670
It does stand for Jesus Christ, okay.

940
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:41,631
Yeah, but there's more to the story than that. Hold on.

941
00:51:41,852 --> 00:51:42,152
Okay.

942
00:51:42,992 --> 00:51:46,794
One of my best friends is a wonderful writer named Bradley Denton, who you should all go read.

943
00:51:46,814 --> 00:51:49,095
He wrote a book called Blackburn, which you should all read.

944
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:53,101
And if you want to know about me and my friends, he wrote a book called Lunatics, which you

945
00:51:53,121 --> 00:51:54,824
should all read, and then you can try and guess who I am.

946
00:51:56,467 --> 00:51:57,529
Anyway, he is...

947
00:51:59,448 --> 00:52:01,329
one of the nicest humans on the planet.

948
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:04,931
And I call him helpful guy,

949
00:52:05,011 --> 00:52:06,892
because if you ever need any help with anything,

950
00:52:06,952 --> 00:52:08,093
he is there for you.

951
00:52:08,854 --> 00:52:11,335
And he's so helpful, it gets annoying sometimes.

952
00:52:11,875 --> 00:52:14,757
So back then I would often find myself saying,

953
00:52:14,917 --> 00:52:16,378
Jesus Christ, Denton.

954
00:52:17,819 --> 00:52:20,501
Jesus Christ, Denton, don't be so helpful.

955
00:52:21,121 --> 00:52:23,403
And so when it came time to name the character,

956
00:52:23,443 --> 00:52:24,323
it was JC Denton.

957
00:52:25,164 --> 00:52:25,824
That's interesting.

958
00:52:31,734 --> 00:52:33,775
So, I had a two part question actually, if you don't mind.

959
00:52:33,895 --> 00:52:35,055
Okay, we'll make it quick.

960
00:52:35,616 --> 00:52:42,058
Obviously, the internet went crazy over this sort of conspiracy theory that it was Jesus Christ because of what he represented.

961
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:44,359
And obviously no one knew that story, I guess.

962
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,540
I'm not sure I ever told that story.

963
00:52:49,421 --> 00:52:51,402
Did you find that a lot of people came out of the woodwork?

964
00:52:51,422 --> 00:52:57,504
Because it's a conspiracy theory centric game, what was the craziest conspiracy theory around the game development that you've ever heard?

965
00:52:58,344 --> 00:52:59,085
Ah, wow.

966
00:53:00,202 --> 00:53:02,547
I'm not actually sure. I don't have an answer for that.

967
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:07,115
Sorry. It was a complicated question. Thank you.

968
00:53:07,135 --> 00:53:09,219
Good day. My name is Marvin. I'm a design developer.

969
00:53:10,878 --> 00:53:14,841
huge fan of Deus Ex or Deus Ex as I called it in high school probably.

970
00:53:16,142 --> 00:53:19,485
Actually I thought that was funny. I called it Deus Ex because you know it's

971
00:53:19,765 --> 00:53:22,827
God from the machine right? I thought sentient AI that would be

972
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:27,090
fun and say something about the game. My mom almost didn't buy it for me because

973
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:29,132
of the name. A lot of people didn't buy it because of

974
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:32,735
the name. I thought it'd be funny if people mispronounced it and said Deus

975
00:53:32,755 --> 00:53:33,996
Ex. I got sex in the name.

976
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:44,407
Just wondering are there any games like modern or classic that you really feel capture like the the

977
00:53:44,908 --> 00:53:49,872
Vibe I guess of day sex. Oh, yeah, you know one of the things that's been most gratifying is

978
00:53:50,632 --> 00:53:52,274
I'm not gonna name names here either, but

979
00:53:53,174 --> 00:53:53,335
part

980
00:53:54,546 --> 00:53:56,967
Okay, everybody in this room is going to hate me when I say this.

981
00:53:57,328 --> 00:54:01,550
Part of my secret goal with Deus Ex was to shame other developers

982
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:04,152
so they could never make the kinds of games they made again.

983
00:54:06,313 --> 00:54:08,034
And it didn't work.

984
00:54:09,495 --> 00:54:11,236
But I was really gratified.

985
00:54:12,357 --> 00:54:15,879
Lots of developers and lots of people from other studios...

986
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,702
you know, talked to me at conferences like this one and said that

987
00:54:20,183 --> 00:54:24,687
they changed the way they thought about the games they were making as a result of having played Deus Ex and

988
00:54:25,107 --> 00:54:29,191
a couple of them completely redesigned their games after they played it, which was probably foolish.

989
00:54:32,249 --> 00:54:35,412
But having influence is great.

990
00:54:35,472 --> 00:54:37,033
And now I see more and more games

991
00:54:38,334 --> 00:54:41,918
that were influenced by games like Underworld

992
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:43,919
and System Shock and Thief and Deus Ex

993
00:54:43,979 --> 00:54:45,140
and that whole lineage.

994
00:54:46,181 --> 00:54:49,164
Right now, it's clearly the Dishonored games

995
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,486
are the ones that capture.

996
00:54:51,966 --> 00:54:56,130
Capture that spirit the best it's like half the guys who work on worked on dishonored

997
00:54:56,391 --> 00:55:01,356
You know we're on my old team, and I can't wait for prey because those are all my old guys

998
00:55:01,416 --> 00:55:04,959
You know who I'd want to hire back to work on system shock 3, but I can't

999
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,243
There well, they're all happy. You know I mean I hate it

1000
00:55:11,689 --> 00:55:20,319
Yeah. Warren, my name is Keith. Thanks for the presentation.

1001
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:23,423
Thank you. Thank John Romero and thank your team for making

1002
00:55:23,463 --> 00:55:27,308
Deus Ex. It's a huge inspiration on me. I have a bit of a loaded

1003
00:55:27,348 --> 00:55:29,490
question for you. Apologies for putting you on the spot.

1004
00:55:31,312 --> 00:55:35,595
Since its initial release in 2000, I've always wanted to play this game in VR.

1005
00:55:36,196 --> 00:55:42,520
And if the source code of this game ever comes out, I'm dropping everything I'm doing and making a VR version of this.

1006
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,542
Is there anything you can do to help me with that first part?

1007
00:55:47,563 --> 00:55:49,205
I'd recommend therapy.

1008
00:55:54,668 --> 00:55:58,251
No, you know, I have no idea what... Actually, I do have an idea where the source code is.

1009
00:55:59,915 --> 00:56:02,016
I can't believe I just said that and I'm being recorded.

1010
00:56:04,177 --> 00:56:07,218
But it's not going to get released.

1011
00:56:07,318 --> 00:56:12,100
I mean, someday you might be able to go to the Center for

1012
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,821
American History's video game archive and find it there and

1013
00:56:15,881 --> 00:56:16,962
do something amazing with it.

1014
00:56:17,062 --> 00:56:21,043
But I'm not going to be releasing it anytime soon.

1015
00:56:21,263 --> 00:56:25,805
And frankly, I don't know that long-form VR, real-time

1016
00:56:25,845 --> 00:56:29,107
movement through a 3D world is the best answer for VR anyway.

1017
00:56:30,843 --> 00:56:34,627
Thank you. Although system shock actually supported VR in 1994,

1018
00:56:34,687 --> 00:56:43,516
the last time VR was going to save us. He said it. Yeah.

1019
00:56:43,976 --> 00:56:49,181
Hi, Warren. My name is Hugh. I run a small indie studio. So for

1020
00:56:49,201 --> 00:56:53,845
you as a creator, where do you draw the line between

1021
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:00,002
obviousness and subtlety, especially from a narrative standpoint. Because what I've found is

1022
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:06,305
that we made a game where you're employed by a company whose logo is a black skull on a red

1023
00:57:06,365 --> 00:57:14,769
banner and people didn't get that they were the bad guys. So like, I mean, where do you ‑‑

1024
00:57:15,249 --> 00:57:20,712
system shock, not system shock, excuse me, Deus Ex is a game that is mired in a lot of these

1025
00:57:20,992 --> 00:57:23,753
subtleties and narrative elements, but.

1026
00:57:25,356 --> 00:57:29,839
I think also it seems like a lot of people still managed to get a lot of what was going on with

1027
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:36,684
that game. And like as a designer, there are things that you might think are obvious that end

1028
00:57:36,724 --> 00:57:42,609
up being very subtle to the consumer. Well, there are, wow, that's about 16 questions in one.

1029
00:57:42,909 --> 00:57:49,994
First of all, have a great writing team. I had four writers. All of them, with one exception,

1030
00:57:50,354 --> 00:57:52,816
were programmers who could write, not writers who could not.

1031
00:57:53,614 --> 00:57:57,055
could, who we tried to make interactive writers.

1032
00:57:58,356 --> 00:57:59,136
I think that helped.

1033
00:58:00,416 --> 00:58:04,117
They were, I mean like one of the writers had a dual degree

1034
00:58:04,217 --> 00:58:07,839
in what creative writing and computer science from MIT and

1035
00:58:07,879 --> 00:58:09,339
Harvard simultaneously.

1036
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:13,260
It's kind of easy to make an intelligent game when you've

1037
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,541
got people like that on board.

1038
00:58:16,421 --> 00:58:19,542
But honestly, I don't worry about that too much.

1039
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:24,471
kind of, I'm the luckiest guy in the game business in that I

1040
00:58:24,511 --> 00:58:25,972
get to make the games I want to make the

1041
00:58:26,372 --> 00:58:27,232
way I want to make them.

1042
00:58:27,772 --> 00:58:32,174
And I try to make games that I want to play or that I find

1043
00:58:32,234 --> 00:58:34,995
appealing and hope enough people find them appealing

1044
00:58:35,035 --> 00:58:36,276
that I get to make another one.

1045
00:58:37,576 --> 00:58:40,498
So subtlety and intelligence are important to me.

1046
00:58:40,718 --> 00:58:45,060
And if I have to dumb down a game to sell 20 million copies,

1047
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,580
I'm going to not make games anymore.

1048
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,221
Thanks.

1049
00:58:51,823 --> 00:58:54,445
Yeah, the applause was a little weak for that one.

1050
00:58:54,465 --> 00:58:59,468
Hi, Warren. My name is Michael Higham. I'm actually an editor

1051
00:58:59,528 --> 00:59:03,130
at gamespot.com. Deus Ex means a lot to me so I could ask you a

1052
00:59:03,171 --> 00:59:06,252
million questions but I'm not going to do that. So I'd whittle

1053
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:13,197
it down to maybe one, maybe two. Sorry. So I want to ask, how

1054
00:59:13,257 --> 00:59:16,119
much of a hand did you have in the sound design and the music

1055
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:20,601
and was that made in parallel to the game or did you

1056
00:59:21,872 --> 00:59:24,334
Was it Alexander Brandon who composed most of the music?

1057
00:59:24,354 --> 00:59:24,995
Yeah.

1058
00:59:25,035 --> 00:59:25,175
Yeah.

1059
00:59:25,275 --> 00:59:26,636
Did you actively work with him?

1060
00:59:26,656 --> 00:59:27,257
Because then that's...

1061
00:59:27,277 --> 00:59:31,480
Because music in the game is one of the most standout things to me.

1062
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:32,921
I was wondering if you had...

1063
00:59:32,941 --> 00:59:34,622
I still listen to the music all the time.

1064
00:59:34,642 --> 00:59:35,063
Yeah, me too.

1065
00:59:36,024 --> 00:59:37,144
And the System Shock soundtrack.

1066
00:59:37,164 --> 00:59:38,045
Those are my two favorites.

1067
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:39,726
Oh, no, and Disney Epic Mickey.

1068
00:59:39,746 --> 00:59:41,248
Those are the three that I still listen to.

1069
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:43,209
No, well, you know, and there is a fourth.

1070
00:59:43,269 --> 00:59:43,409
No.

1071
00:59:45,411 --> 00:59:46,712
No, Alex works, you know...

1072
00:59:47,399 --> 00:59:51,541
three doors down for me, and I was in his office all the time because I love sound.

1073
00:59:51,581 --> 00:59:56,863
I mean, back then, more than today, but even today, I mean, at some level,

1074
00:59:57,664 --> 01:00:00,765
as great as our graphics are, we're still making radio plays, you know.

1075
01:00:00,845 --> 01:00:03,386
And in 1997, that was even more true.

1076
01:00:03,886 --> 01:00:05,627
So, sound design was critical.

1077
01:00:05,687 --> 01:00:10,329
I mean, audio designers, give yourself a pat on the back.

1078
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:11,950
Or one person applauding.

1079
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:19,565
So, you know, again, as the game director,

1080
01:00:19,585 --> 01:00:22,007
I had a slide that was the creative box.

1081
01:00:22,067 --> 01:00:23,648
I mean, that's really important to me.

1082
01:00:23,848 --> 01:00:26,190
It's my job to define the limits

1083
01:00:26,651 --> 01:00:28,492
within which a game is going to exist.

1084
01:00:28,973 --> 01:00:33,977
It's not my job to say, I want a C major chord there.

1085
01:00:34,637 --> 01:00:37,700
So, you know, I kick things off.

1086
01:00:38,472 --> 01:00:42,574
and then it's my job to make sure that everybody's staying in that box, right?

1087
01:00:43,054 --> 01:00:49,377
And so it was the same with Alex. I mean, if he did a, you know, a calliope thing,

1088
01:00:50,138 --> 01:00:53,940
you know, I probably would have said no, but he's a genius and did an amazing job and

1089
01:00:54,940 --> 01:01:00,563
the sound design on Deus Ex was incredible, but my role was mostly, you know, saying,

1090
01:01:01,063 --> 01:01:03,004
hey, that's really great, Alex.

1091
01:01:04,607 --> 01:01:05,729
I think, are we out of time?

1092
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:07,512
I'm afraid we're out of time.

1093
01:01:07,632 --> 01:01:10,056
So like I said, I can take a few questions outside.

1094
01:01:10,077 --> 01:01:11,359
Thanks a lot.
