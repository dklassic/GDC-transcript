1
00:00:06,765 --> 00:00:07,125
Hello.

2
00:00:09,726 --> 00:00:11,747
All right, I think we'll start.

3
00:00:11,787 --> 00:00:14,568
We got a lot to go over, so we'll be pretty punctual.

4
00:00:15,268 --> 00:00:17,129
I'm Ken Brown, I'm the technical art director

5
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:17,929
on Battlefront.

6
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:21,130
I'm in charge of things like workflow, pipeline,

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:24,532
performance, optimization, that kind of thing.

8
00:00:24,552 --> 00:00:27,353
I'm Andrew Hamilton, the lead environment artist

9
00:00:27,373 --> 00:00:27,953
from Battlefront.

10
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:30,814
I was involved in pushing photogrammetry

11
00:00:31,354 --> 00:00:32,795
further into style with Battlefront.

12
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:34,075
So.

13
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:37,388
Photogrammetry.

14
00:00:38,828 --> 00:00:41,869
Buckle up, this is actually a really packed presentation.

15
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,311
Tons of content, a lot of information.

16
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:47,212
We'll be going over kind of everything.

17
00:00:48,332 --> 00:00:49,873
So, like I say, be prepared.

18
00:00:50,893 --> 00:00:51,793
For those of you that don't know,

19
00:00:52,774 --> 00:00:55,115
photogrammetry is just the use of photographs

20
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,655
to make measurements, and in our case,

21
00:00:57,076 --> 00:00:59,517
generating models and textures from those measurements.

22
00:01:00,817 --> 00:01:01,958
The basic process works like this.

23
00:01:02,718 --> 00:01:03,678
You take a series of pictures.

24
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,061
You align those pictures in a photo scan software,

25
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:09,442
in this case, Agisoft.

26
00:01:10,343 --> 00:01:12,384
You generate a point cloud.

27
00:01:13,165 --> 00:01:15,886
From that point cloud, you generate a high density mesh,

28
00:01:16,107 --> 00:01:16,647
high res mesh.

29
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:18,888
And there you can project textures.

30
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:21,810
Oh, we're really early.

31
00:01:27,774 --> 00:01:30,156
So this presentation is a bit of a retrospective

32
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:31,757
of our process of the.

33
00:01:33,674 --> 00:01:36,095
So we'll go over the beginning, the research and development that we did.

34
00:01:36,335 --> 00:01:40,457
We had a really great window of time to do some R&D in the beginning of the project.

35
00:01:41,137 --> 00:01:43,578
What the plans are when we go on the scanning trips.

36
00:01:44,598 --> 00:01:45,959
How we go about capturing the planets.

37
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:47,919
The mentality and workflow.

38
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,561
So workflow for photogrammetry, but some of the mentality around why we use it and how

39
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:52,841
we work.

40
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:55,707
Game assets in a photogrammetry world,

41
00:01:55,727 --> 00:01:57,669
so that is assets that aren't photo scanned

42
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,333
when used in conjunction with photo scanned assets,

43
00:02:00,994 --> 00:02:04,659
terrain, and the resulting level construction kits

44
00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:07,142
that we create, and then a quick wrap up

45
00:02:07,183 --> 00:02:08,544
of our key learnings and takeaways.

46
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,567
So, before we get into the actual photogrammetry,

47
00:02:11,587 --> 00:02:14,528
some of the big changes that we had going into this project

48
00:02:14,588 --> 00:02:15,969
were we were a new console generation,

49
00:02:16,429 --> 00:02:18,910
Battlefield 4 shipped on Gen 4,

50
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,411
but this Battlefront was our first exclusive

51
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:24,893
current Gen title, a PS4 and Xbox One,

52
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:25,993
what we call Gen 4.

53
00:02:27,154 --> 00:02:29,395
It was a brand new franchise for us.

54
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:32,897
There were really high expectations to deliver after BF4

55
00:02:33,097 --> 00:02:35,378
for a lot of reasons, which I won't get into here.

56
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:37,347
but you may be familiar with.

57
00:02:37,828 --> 00:02:39,709
We had a clean slate, this was a brand new project,

58
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:41,490
so we really wanted to set the foundation

59
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,192
for doing this clean and correct from the beginning,

60
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:45,873
so we had a kind of platform to build on

61
00:02:45,913 --> 00:02:47,594
going hopefully well into the future.

62
00:02:48,474 --> 00:02:51,616
For us, PBR was not fully implemented yet when we started.

63
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:53,337
We were one of the first games

64
00:02:54,058 --> 00:02:55,959
on the Frostbite Enchant to be physically based.

65
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:58,901
So some of the challenges with those changes are,

66
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:00,902
this is Star Wars, this is a revered franchise,

67
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:01,803
everyone knows it.

68
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:04,822
Everyone is familiar with the location,

69
00:03:04,862 --> 00:03:06,788
so you have a lot of expectations going into it,

70
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:08,433
a daunting number of expectations.

71
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,421
We had a lot we were learning from the past

72
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:13,102
that we wanted to implement.

73
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:15,664
Photogrammetry is pushing the boundaries

74
00:03:15,724 --> 00:03:19,327
of quality and speed, so how do you work

75
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,589
with this new technology?

76
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,250
We had a really tight development schedule.

77
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,912
We wanted to be 60fps, or we are 60fps,

78
00:03:26,713 --> 00:03:28,614
and when we said 60, we wanted it to be 60,

79
00:03:28,914 --> 00:03:30,035
we didn't want it to be 45 to 50,

80
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:34,098
so that's challenging for those of you that know.

81
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:36,440
And then keeping this all together throughout production,

82
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,121
like keeping the,

83
00:03:37,998 --> 00:03:41,700
Craftsmanship was really big for our process,

84
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,781
so you want to make sure that everyone was always aligned

85
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:44,821
throughout the development process.

86
00:03:45,422 --> 00:03:47,242
So, because this is GDC, I thought we'd super quickly

87
00:03:47,282 --> 00:03:48,703
go over what our development structure was.

88
00:03:48,883 --> 00:03:50,124
We had three month dev cycles,

89
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:52,064
with milestones at the end of those three months.

90
00:03:52,585 --> 00:03:54,545
We would do content development up until the very end,

91
00:03:54,605 --> 00:03:55,566
the very last day of that.

92
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:58,787
That made us realize that we really needed

93
00:03:58,807 --> 00:03:59,868
a two week buffer after that,

94
00:04:00,428 --> 00:04:02,229
after it created quite a bit of traffic jam,

95
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:04,109
so we put a two week buffer between

96
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,270
these three month development cycles.

97
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:05,910
During that,

98
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:09,589
During that two week buffer, we would have an approval lock

99
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:11,990
where you would need a producer or a DD or a director

100
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,130
to approve your check-in, and during that time,

101
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,271
we would be stabilizing the build.

102
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,611
So that was our basic process.

103
00:04:16,651 --> 00:04:17,952
We were really happy, actually, I would say,

104
00:04:18,252 --> 00:04:18,952
with how this went.

105
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:21,373
We'll be continuing with this basic model as we go forward.

106
00:04:21,993 --> 00:04:23,393
This was a successful structure for us.

107
00:04:24,673 --> 00:04:27,874
Yeah, so photogrammetry is not our first outing

108
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:28,915
in photogrammetry.

109
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,935
We did this in Battlefront III on most of the characters,

110
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:34,436
and in Battlefront IV, pushing it a bit more,

111
00:04:34,456 --> 00:04:35,677
you know, a few rocks here and there, but.

112
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,599
going into Battlefront, we wanted to make sure

113
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:41,541
we were utilizing this to the best we possibly could.

114
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:44,082
So we had a lot of great access to things like

115
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:46,283
the Star Wars archives with all the real props

116
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:48,824
from the old movies, especially considering

117
00:04:48,844 --> 00:04:50,104
we were aiming for authenticity.

118
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:53,205
Some of the scans turned out really great.

119
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,907
Other ones were from old materials and things

120
00:04:56,927 --> 00:04:59,408
that didn't quite work out, so we were combining

121
00:04:59,428 --> 00:05:01,849
with other things as well that wasn't photogrammetry,

122
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:04,290
such as marvelous designer to create cloth.

123
00:05:05,545 --> 00:05:07,786
supplementing that with things with hard surface modeling,

124
00:05:07,806 --> 00:05:09,567
just a typical, the usual way we do it.

125
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:13,648
And combining all those pieces into kind of a final result

126
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,109
with many, many techniques.

127
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,392
Here's some quick in-game, quick final renders

128
00:05:20,452 --> 00:05:22,432
of the in-game assets themselves.

129
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:25,594
And even the beard itself is scanned from.

130
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:26,754
Yeah, that was my beard.

131
00:05:26,774 --> 00:05:28,455
I'm very proud of that.

132
00:05:30,736 --> 00:05:32,697
So yeah, with the learnings from Battlefront,

133
00:05:32,877 --> 00:05:33,978
Battlefield, we were.

134
00:05:34,837 --> 00:05:36,097
seeing where we take this.

135
00:05:36,137 --> 00:05:37,558
Do we scan everything in the environment?

136
00:05:37,998 --> 00:05:40,579
We wanted to naturally try and bridge that gap

137
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:42,719
between the photo-scanned characters

138
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,940
with the surroundings,

139
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,500
so they would kind of be on par with each other.

140
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:48,462
And it was the goal, obviously,

141
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:49,622
to make the best-looking Star Wars game

142
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,603
that's ever been seen at 60 FPS

143
00:05:52,843 --> 00:05:53,643
with very little time.

144
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:58,670
So this is from Battlefield 3 on the kill,

145
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,051
the level we did, and the goal here was to make

146
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:02,952
something realistic, photorealistic,

147
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,133
but this was without any techniques like photogrammetry,

148
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:10,315
using traditional methods.

149
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:12,396
So going from here into Battlefront,

150
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:15,557
we introduced a lot of new, interesting

151
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:17,978
pipeline and workflow options.

152
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,519
So we'll go into how we got from there to here

153
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:21,460
through this presentation.

154
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,180
Here's just a quick video of us on location.

155
00:08:01,893 --> 00:08:04,655
Let's take one more coffee and then we go skiing.

156
00:08:05,055 --> 00:08:10,078
So it wasn't all fun and games on these trips. It was a bit tough.

157
00:08:10,278 --> 00:08:14,941
Not always glamorous.

158
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,662
So just a quick overview of some of our goals

159
00:08:28,702 --> 00:08:29,422
for one of these trips.

160
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:33,246
Obviously to capture the natural asset library

161
00:08:33,266 --> 00:08:34,727
for all the planets we plan to build.

162
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,789
We focused on capturing only what was essential

163
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:38,150
on the trip.

164
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:40,612
There's certainly a lot more in the locations to capture,

165
00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:42,633
but we thought about what we essentially needed

166
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:43,814
to reconstruct these.

167
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:48,118
Yeah, with meaningful variation and features,

168
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:50,420
things that would give the highest bang for the buck,

169
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:50,860
basically.

170
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:56,547
Visiting the real locations was great for true inspiration

171
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:58,329
and understanding of actually how to build the environment.

172
00:08:58,349 --> 00:09:02,353
So I'd say going on those trips was even more important

173
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:03,794
to be there rather than just bringing back

174
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:05,256
the assets themselves.

175
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,499
On the trips we kept it very simple.

176
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,421
We had, I mean, there's plenty of great rigs we could have

177
00:09:11,441 --> 00:09:14,403
taken, but for our case we wanted to be on the move as

178
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:17,625
much as possible, so we kept our kit as simple as possible

179
00:09:17,665 --> 00:09:18,766
as well to make that possible.

180
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:23,989
So just a regular Canon 6D 24mm lens, tripod, color chart.

181
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:25,430
That's really about it.

182
00:09:27,251 --> 00:09:28,872
Ideal weather conditions, obviously not under our

183
00:09:28,912 --> 00:09:32,994
control, but we tried to plan for these as best as possible.

184
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,716
Going to Iceland is not so good where it's always cloudy,

185
00:09:35,736 --> 00:09:36,156
things like that.

186
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,851
And breaking down the location.

187
00:09:39,191 --> 00:09:40,851
We didn't want to just arrive on location

188
00:09:40,932 --> 00:09:42,752
and just capture what we could.

189
00:09:42,772 --> 00:09:44,813
We needed to be very thorough and plan through

190
00:09:44,953 --> 00:09:46,433
exactly what we needed before we got there.

191
00:09:48,374 --> 00:09:50,134
And thinking in terms of usable pieces,

192
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,915
we could have captured really great organic shapes,

193
00:09:52,935 --> 00:09:54,836
but we need to make sure the things we were capturing

194
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:57,397
were tileable, modular, and that kind of stuff.

195
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:01,458
As well as being aware of frostbite strengths

196
00:10:01,498 --> 00:10:02,078
and weaknesses.

197
00:10:02,698 --> 00:10:05,119
It's very good at terrain systems and things like that,

198
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:06,620
so we pushed more on that side.

199
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:12,113
Yeah, and you know, there's not a,

200
00:10:12,393 --> 00:10:13,894
sometimes with photo scan it's a bit difficult

201
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,995
to get great captures, especially when you're out

202
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,076
in the wild, so we wanted to make sure we captured

203
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:20,718
a few things but of good quality to make sure

204
00:10:20,738 --> 00:10:22,619
we spend time with them, rather than just capturing

205
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,500
the entire environment at lower quality.

206
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:27,621
Here's a quick shot of being on location

207
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:29,923
when we first arrived to the Redwood Forest.

208
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:32,766
Just to show you how we break down the environment.

209
00:10:32,786 --> 00:10:35,029
There's a lot here that you can imagine that you capture,

210
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:36,971
but when you break it down to smaller pieces,

211
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:38,913
there's not really that many elements

212
00:10:38,953 --> 00:10:40,695
that was needed to create this

213
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:41,936
and get a sense of the environment.

214
00:10:42,897 --> 00:10:44,919
So things like the dirt on the ground as a texture.

215
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:48,941
the mesh scattering on top of that, the clover as a ground,

216
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:51,603
the clover mesh scattering, ferns of different sizes,

217
00:10:51,623 --> 00:10:53,745
logs of different sizes, trees of different sizes,

218
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:55,626
some unique trees like stumps,

219
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:57,788
and vegetation that is captured on blue board.

220
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,931
Yeah, so some best practices as well.

221
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:05,094
These are very well known best practices,

222
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:08,056
but it's very easy to let these things slip by

223
00:11:08,076 --> 00:11:08,717
when you're out in the field.

224
00:11:09,661 --> 00:11:11,162
We always have to remind ourselves about this.

225
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:14,244
Overlap, naturally, again, very easy to forget.

226
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:16,525
And the number one thing that just destroys

227
00:11:17,165 --> 00:11:17,866
are good to capture.

228
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,287
As well as covering all the angles.

229
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,849
Just filling in blobby holes and things

230
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:26,971
through bad scans, through photo scan is not ideal.

231
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:29,992
Avoiding cast shadow, something that is sometimes

232
00:11:30,052 --> 00:11:32,354
out of our control, but trying to capture

233
00:11:32,394 --> 00:11:34,615
in shady locations, in overcast conditions,

234
00:11:34,635 --> 00:11:35,095
things like that.

235
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:39,463
And most reliable results from our trips

236
00:11:39,523 --> 00:11:43,107
were from capturing assets when they're in full frame.

237
00:11:43,848 --> 00:11:45,950
We'd start in the first few trips

238
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,572
by capturing things a little bit too close,

239
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,754
and then you run into the problems of overlap

240
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:50,655
and covering all the angles.

241
00:11:50,715 --> 00:11:52,577
So it was best to kind of step back a bit.

242
00:11:53,118 --> 00:11:55,420
We didn't need the extremely high detail quality

243
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,743
in the end anyway, so it was useless information.

244
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,900
And photo scan is not great at the moment with things like

245
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,762
grass and noisy textures, so we just avoided those kind of

246
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:08,224
surfaces and rather broke them down into components.

247
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:13,168
Yeah, and just being sure that the capture methods are

248
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:16,130
consistent and clean, making sure everybody runs through the

249
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,311
same camera settings, the same way they capture things.

250
00:12:18,331 --> 00:12:21,574
So every time an asset is brought back to the studio, it

251
00:12:21,614 --> 00:12:22,875
can be processed in the same way.

252
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,421
And preparing yourself and equipment for those conditions,

253
00:12:27,941 --> 00:12:29,221
something that sounds quite simple as well,

254
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:30,602
but when you're going through snowstorms

255
00:12:30,682 --> 00:12:32,082
and off to Death Valley, I mean,

256
00:12:32,282 --> 00:12:35,643
the conditions are variable in the extremes,

257
00:12:35,783 --> 00:12:38,904
so we need to be sure we're quite serious about that.

258
00:12:40,825 --> 00:12:43,345
Here's a little slideshow of some of the locations

259
00:12:43,425 --> 00:12:45,966
we have been to, to show the variation

260
00:12:47,607 --> 00:12:48,567
across all the biomes.

261
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:53,708
Very varying weather conditions, quite extreme.

262
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,809
I have to say that sometimes I actually lose track

263
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:00,051
of which ones are the capture shots

264
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,632
than the in-game shots now.

265
00:13:03,394 --> 00:13:04,756
The guys did a really great job.

266
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:10,582
Brought back a great range of textures in our library.

267
00:13:11,103 --> 00:13:13,125
3D scanned textures for the ground surfaces

268
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:15,928
across the terrain and vegetation on blue boards.

269
00:13:16,308 --> 00:13:17,530
We'll get to that a little bit later.

270
00:13:18,502 --> 00:13:20,823
And as you can see here, the objects are quite boring.

271
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,284
They're very generic, and that's intentional.

272
00:13:22,324 --> 00:13:24,326
We didn't want them to stand out.

273
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:27,368
As we're making a very limited set of assets, for the

274
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:29,749
limitations, we need to make sure they were easily

275
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:32,531
rotatable and placeable without feeling too repetitive

276
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:33,252
in the environment.

277
00:13:34,632 --> 00:13:35,993
Even Duggar owned trenches in Hoth.

278
00:13:38,035 --> 00:13:38,115
So.

279
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:41,737
In general, they were pretty successful trips.

280
00:13:41,777 --> 00:13:43,658
They were progressively successful the more we did.

281
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:44,859
We learned a lot along the way.

282
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:47,040
But having a small and manageable team

283
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,361
was definitely a key to the success,

284
00:13:49,381 --> 00:13:52,782
so we could make sure we could keep focus on what we're doing.

285
00:13:54,623 --> 00:13:55,744
Yep, keeping focus on what we're doing

286
00:13:55,804 --> 00:13:58,125
and structured with a list of what we need to get.

287
00:14:00,576 --> 00:14:03,919
And mentioned before, I do think that being on the trips

288
00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:07,322
was, and being in the locations, understanding how they are

289
00:14:07,402 --> 00:14:09,644
constructed is more important than actually the assets

290
00:14:09,664 --> 00:14:10,044
themselves.

291
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:15,409
Coming back from the trips, we had a huge amount of data.

292
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,972
And that was, you know, we manually sorted this,

293
00:14:19,273 --> 00:14:20,654
and it was really horrible.

294
00:14:21,415 --> 00:14:22,616
So it's something we need to look forward to

295
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:24,057
improving in the future.

296
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:29,353
Hundreds of thousands of photos, assets and video to categorize.

297
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:34,435
No real storage solution on our first round considering the compressed time we had to

298
00:14:35,235 --> 00:14:36,015
work with this content.

299
00:14:37,095 --> 00:14:37,876
Much room for improvement.

300
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,317
So, workflow.

301
00:14:44,077 --> 00:14:46,098
We've got the data now so let's get to it.

302
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,702
Before, really quick, I get into the actual workflow itself.

303
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,104
This was a question that came up during the early days

304
00:14:52,144 --> 00:14:54,426
of our photo scanning work, and that's,

305
00:14:55,046 --> 00:14:56,847
okay, we're seeing these high quality assets,

306
00:14:56,887 --> 00:14:59,870
but there were a lot of people challenging us

307
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:00,990
on the management level saying,

308
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,572
okay, but is this actually faster?

309
00:15:02,612 --> 00:15:03,792
Like, what's the reality of this?

310
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:06,234
I hear people saying that this takes twice as long,

311
00:15:06,274 --> 00:15:07,695
or this is four times as fast, or what is it?

312
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:09,757
So we did have a bit of a straw poll.

313
00:15:09,957 --> 00:15:11,458
This wasn't a scientific poll,

314
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:12,579
but we asked people around the team.

315
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:15,961
their experience building assets on BF4

316
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:18,842
and their experience building assets with this new pipeline,

317
00:15:19,202 --> 00:15:20,263
with the photo scan pipeline.

318
00:15:20,683 --> 00:15:21,744
And a lot of things stay the same.

319
00:15:21,784 --> 00:15:23,104
Retopology stays about the same.

320
00:15:23,184 --> 00:15:24,225
Texturing stays about the same.

321
00:15:24,245 --> 00:15:25,506
But you have little savings here and there.

322
00:15:25,866 --> 00:15:27,687
And you save a ton on the high poly time.

323
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:30,048
So, I mean, the quick answer was that,

324
00:15:30,128 --> 00:15:31,849
yes, that it was faster for us.

325
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:33,970
And we felt that...

326
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:37,792
as we kind of go along and become more experienced at this

327
00:15:37,952 --> 00:15:39,693
and we develop better techniques for this.

328
00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:40,594
And this is something we're still

329
00:15:40,634 --> 00:15:41,674
kind of continually improving on.

330
00:15:41,714 --> 00:15:43,095
And one of the exciting things about this

331
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:44,556
is that there are a lot of room for improvements

332
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,936
is that we actually expect this to be

333
00:15:45,956 --> 00:15:47,457
even faster kind of going forward.

334
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:49,378
So the actual workflow.

335
00:15:50,772 --> 00:15:51,913
We have the source photographs.

336
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,213
You take those into Photoshop

337
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:56,454
with a Photoshop camera raw plugin.

338
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:57,754
Simply remove the vignette.

339
00:15:57,854 --> 00:15:59,775
We kept distortion because Agisoft,

340
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:00,875
the software that we're using,

341
00:16:00,915 --> 00:16:03,176
can handle the distortion of the lens.

342
00:16:03,676 --> 00:16:05,417
We would do a batch calibration with the color charts,

343
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,357
and this is actually an example

344
00:16:06,377 --> 00:16:07,318
of one-on-one that's improved.

345
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:09,778
At the EA Capture Lab, they've actually

346
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,083
a much better batch and color calibration method

347
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:16,226
that creates much more accurate color results

348
00:16:17,287 --> 00:16:18,148
and is much faster.

349
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:20,190
But this is a good example of a step

350
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,072
that could be or should be entirely automated.

351
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:27,093
So once you have those calibrated photos,

352
00:16:27,113 --> 00:16:29,515
you take them, we often first, for most assets,

353
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:31,776
we would mask out the asset.

354
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,158
That is like, you know, draw an actual mask around

355
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:35,138
to help isolate it.

356
00:16:35,158 --> 00:16:37,760
It would just ensure slightly more consistent results.

357
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:41,963
We would bake at high for normal assets,

358
00:16:42,063 --> 00:16:43,444
for props and objects,

359
00:16:43,684 --> 00:16:45,325
and we would bake at ultra for our terrain.

360
00:16:46,066 --> 00:16:47,467
It's worth noting that your file sizes

361
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,028
can be pretty daunting at that point,

362
00:16:49,088 --> 00:16:51,310
but those are the settings that give us the best results.

363
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:55,001
We would use Mosaic rather than Average Blur,

364
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:56,783
blend rather, within Agisoft.

365
00:16:56,803 --> 00:16:58,584
We found that it gave us sharper results.

366
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:00,366
We did quite a few comparisons in the beginning

367
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:01,987
and we were happiest with Mosaic.

368
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:05,170
Agisoft, or photo scanning in general probably,

369
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,932
will give you quite shredded UVs.

370
00:17:07,332 --> 00:17:09,775
So we would take them into additional software

371
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:14,579
to do our reprojections, so Zebraish or similar software.

372
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,887
We would take the high res mesh and in some cases

373
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:19,830
we would just automatically generate a low res mesh

374
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:20,911
in software like MeshLab.

375
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:24,175
Or if it needed a little bit more of a artist touch

376
00:17:24,235 --> 00:17:25,317
we would take it into TopoGun

377
00:17:25,357 --> 00:17:28,982
or any retopology software of your choice and retopologize.

378
00:17:30,979 --> 00:17:32,420
We would make use of detailed textures,

379
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,581
so that meant that we really needed to have as much,

380
00:17:35,861 --> 00:17:37,922
or as little stretching on the UVs as possible,

381
00:17:37,962 --> 00:17:39,223
so that was key to our workflow,

382
00:17:39,723 --> 00:17:41,043
and we had to be kind of conscious

383
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,364
of what the UV direction was

384
00:17:42,424 --> 00:17:45,585
because we were using detailed tile normal maps,

385
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,386
so we needed consistent direction.

386
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:51,147
Within XNormal, we would generate our base map,

387
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:53,068
so color, tangent normal, object normal,

388
00:17:53,508 --> 00:17:56,709
height map, AO cavity, just your standard maps.

389
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:00,368
And one of the maps we would generate is the

390
00:18:00,468 --> 00:18:02,210
optics-based normal map, which we would use to

391
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,593
remove ambient lighting, and in some cases, cast shadows.

392
00:18:06,073 --> 00:18:07,555
There are other techniques for doing this,

393
00:18:07,595 --> 00:18:10,778
but we were quite pleased with how this worked.

394
00:18:10,918 --> 00:18:14,521
To go into it a little bit, the light removal process,

395
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:16,743
the 16-bit images are your friend.

396
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,005
There's just that much more color information for you to use.

397
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,007
And with the Photoshop Camera Raw plugin,

398
00:18:21,027 --> 00:18:22,108
there's actually a shadow remove.

399
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:25,772
slider, which is fairly effective in a lot of cases.

400
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:26,733
It's not perfect all the time,

401
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,295
but it will get you a bit of the way there.

402
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:31,018
Once you remove the shadow,

403
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:32,320
then you can move on to the ambient light.

404
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,323
And as I said, object space, number maps for the wind.

405
00:18:35,343 --> 00:18:36,624
I'll show how this actually works.

406
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:37,886
So in this example, you can see.

407
00:18:39,189 --> 00:18:40,650
It's not particularly distinct shadows,

408
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,951
you don't have harsh shadows,

409
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:44,392
but you do have like bounce lights

410
00:18:44,452 --> 00:18:45,933
and ambient occlusion, things like that.

411
00:18:45,953 --> 00:18:47,313
And you want to remove that lighting information,

412
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:48,054
that's the final goal.

413
00:18:48,074 --> 00:18:50,775
So you have just a generic albedo base color.

414
00:18:51,576 --> 00:18:53,096
So we generate an object normal map,

415
00:18:53,296 --> 00:18:56,758
giving us directions for each of the objects normals.

416
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,239
And from Photoshop you can then create

417
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:01,160
a black and white mask based on those colors

418
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,961
which will give you distinct directions.

419
00:19:03,982 --> 00:19:04,442
Something like this.

420
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:07,692
And then you'll be able to basically just do standard

421
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:09,693
Photoshop tweaking, take something like that to this.

422
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,833
And this is a pretty quick example.

423
00:19:15,914 --> 00:19:18,815
So now we have the source data, now we have our base maps.

424
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:22,055
A quick word on that, now that we have them,

425
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:25,256
on texel density, most of you are probably familiar

426
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:27,176
with this I'm sure, but for those of you that don't know,

427
00:19:27,577 --> 00:19:29,097
texel is the graphical representation

428
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:30,137
of a pixel on the screen.

429
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,265
of a texture pixel on the screen pixel.

430
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,986
This was an initial pitfall for us

431
00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:36,586
because the data we were getting back

432
00:19:36,606 --> 00:19:38,487
was so high resolution, we were just like,

433
00:19:38,527 --> 00:19:39,188
oh yeah, let's use it.

434
00:19:39,228 --> 00:19:42,149
Like, we're getting 8K textures, 16K textures,

435
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:43,910
let's use them because higher is better.

436
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,851
Like, that's an easy way to think of,

437
00:19:45,911 --> 00:19:47,212
or like a common way to think about it,

438
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:47,992
you know, bigger is better.

439
00:19:48,773 --> 00:19:50,434
So the screenshots coming up are 1080p,

440
00:19:50,574 --> 00:19:51,394
just as a point of reference,

441
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:53,415
and this illustrates that texture pixel ratio

442
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:54,356
to screen pixel.

443
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,397
pixel ratio.

444
00:19:55,918 --> 00:20:00,604
So 1080p, at the bottom there is 512, that's 512 pixels counted on that screen.

445
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:05,691
And you see on this rock, and this is early, very early work, this isn't end assets or

446
00:20:05,711 --> 00:20:06,192
anything like that.

447
00:20:06,232 --> 00:20:10,818
But the white square on that rock represents a 512 texture, and the red square represents

448
00:20:10,858 --> 00:20:11,138
I believe a 32.

449
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,681
by 32 texture and in this shot you have 25 texture pixels per

450
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:20,242
screen pixel. So just way more pixels than you can ever

451
00:20:20,282 --> 00:20:24,703
generate. Then you can even use excluding the mip maps. So here

452
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,804
still too many pixels in the texture, still too many, still

453
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:30,225
too many. You have to get to this distance before you have

454
00:20:30,725 --> 00:20:33,746
more textures in the pixel than you have on the screen to render

455
00:20:33,786 --> 00:20:37,607
those pixels. So just a storm trooper helmet here for scale

456
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:40,167
reference and you can see it's closer than you're ever

457
00:20:40,227 --> 00:20:41,408
reasonably going to get in.

458
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,891
in our game, in a first person game, third person game.

459
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:47,652
So, I mean, another aspect of this is that

460
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:49,873
the data we're getting back is so good,

461
00:20:49,913 --> 00:20:51,474
like it's so, you just don't need

462
00:20:51,514 --> 00:20:53,215
that much texture information, so,

463
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,836
and we're dealing with texture budgets like everyone else,

464
00:20:56,876 --> 00:20:59,717
so here's a rock with two 4K textures showing,

465
00:21:00,197 --> 00:21:02,298
taking up 55 megs of memory with our compression.

466
00:21:02,978 --> 00:21:06,320
And here's a 1K texture taking up 3.7 megabytes.

467
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,840
And I'll flip between those,

468
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,221
because you really can't see the difference that much

469
00:21:10,742 --> 00:21:12,122
when we're using our detail maps.

470
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:14,835
So the takeaways from this were,

471
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:16,136
you'd be surprised what you can get away with.

472
00:21:16,396 --> 00:21:18,157
Like, when you have such great source data,

473
00:21:18,177 --> 00:21:19,678
you can actually push it a little bit further

474
00:21:19,698 --> 00:21:20,998
than you traditionally could.

475
00:21:21,719 --> 00:21:22,779
Detail maps are our friends.

476
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,260
Large textures have a huge streaming overhead.

477
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,701
This isn't a surprise, but I mean,

478
00:21:26,721 --> 00:21:28,642
it takes a couple seconds to stream an 8K texture.

479
00:21:29,222 --> 00:21:30,243
It's completely impractical for us.

480
00:21:30,363 --> 00:21:31,964
I'm sure there's ways around this,

481
00:21:32,004 --> 00:21:34,045
but for us it was a non-starter.

482
00:21:35,165 --> 00:21:37,707
We had an 800 megabyte budget for our textures,

483
00:21:37,927 --> 00:21:39,768
and an 8K texture is almost 90 megs

484
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:40,828
with our compression, so yeah.

485
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:42,149
So many reasons not to do it.

486
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:47,594
So another feature we have within our engine is

487
00:21:47,814 --> 00:21:49,815
texture arrays, just a texture array is an asset

488
00:21:49,855 --> 00:21:52,416
that has several textures kind of stacked within it,

489
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:53,117
within an index.

490
00:21:54,097 --> 00:21:54,177
And...

491
00:21:56,187 --> 00:21:59,130
Because our base, we would opt for a lower resolution

492
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:02,213
base texture, we could use these detail maps on top.

493
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:04,015
And then we would have a preset shader

494
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:05,456
that all environment assets would use

495
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,178
for ease of kind of modification.

496
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:08,980
And then within those preset shaders,

497
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,022
we would have a planet-specific texture array

498
00:22:11,303 --> 00:22:12,324
with several detailed textures

499
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:13,545
that we would use for each planet.

500
00:22:14,006 --> 00:22:15,287
This was basically just a performance

501
00:22:15,307 --> 00:22:16,168
and efficiency saving thing,

502
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,110
but that also gave us kind of consistent quality.

503
00:22:18,985 --> 00:22:20,346
So this is how our texture array is set up.

504
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:22,749
You can kind of see the texture there in the middle,

505
00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:23,971
the one with the actual texture,

506
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:25,573
for normal reflectance and color.

507
00:22:25,873 --> 00:22:27,595
And then I've got the little multiply node circled there.

508
00:22:28,676 --> 00:22:30,418
In this case, we'd multiply by a factor of four

509
00:22:30,478 --> 00:22:32,601
to give us an index from zero to four,

510
00:22:32,641 --> 00:22:34,984
so five indices to choose from.

511
00:22:35,624 --> 00:22:37,786
And this is relevant because we would just pipe in

512
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:41,210
a gray scale texture with gray scale values

513
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,531
that were multiplied by that factor

514
00:22:42,551 --> 00:22:44,433
and you would get the five even steps.

515
00:22:44,653 --> 00:22:48,016
So for example, you've got 25% gray for bark

516
00:22:48,356 --> 00:22:50,198
and if you multiply that by four you get a value of one.

517
00:22:50,218 --> 00:22:53,001
So that's your second index if you're starting at zero.

518
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:59,020
And then, this also afforded us an opportunity

519
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,463
for an optimization where we would fade the detail

520
00:23:02,663 --> 00:23:05,206
at a pretty quick distance,

521
00:23:05,286 --> 00:23:07,128
and then from LOD zero to LOD one,

522
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:11,212
we could switch to a more efficient shader on LOD one.

523
00:23:11,352 --> 00:23:12,673
So a nice performance gain for us.

524
00:23:13,717 --> 00:23:16,038
And the texture array of five textures wasn't just,

525
00:23:16,638 --> 00:23:18,018
it wasn't limited to just the five textures

526
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,640
because we pack different information into the channels.

527
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,941
So in this example here you see the red and green channel

528
00:23:23,981 --> 00:23:24,922
was used for our normal map.

529
00:23:25,062 --> 00:23:26,522
We would derive the blue channel.

530
00:23:26,942 --> 00:23:28,343
The blue channel was used for reflectance

531
00:23:28,723 --> 00:23:30,824
and A for like a gray scale overlay on the color.

532
00:23:30,984 --> 00:23:33,765
So we're effectively five textures

533
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,306
times three different uses of those,

534
00:23:36,346 --> 00:23:37,787
15 different options within one asset.

535
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:40,577
And this is an example of how that works.

536
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:45,641
So in Photoshop, we would blur out the surface detail.

537
00:23:45,781 --> 00:23:47,762
We would remove the high frequency detail,

538
00:23:47,803 --> 00:23:49,023
keeping the low frequency detail.

539
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,726
Important details, and this is the zoomed in shot here

540
00:23:51,746 --> 00:23:53,006
of that low resolution texture.

541
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:56,629
Quite low resolution, quite a savings in texture memory,

542
00:23:56,649 --> 00:23:58,371
because again, we were at like 512 texture sizes.

543
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,435
And then here is with the detail map over top.

544
00:24:05,175 --> 00:24:07,037
And we would actually source this detail,

545
00:24:07,338 --> 00:24:09,179
normal texture from a photo scan source as well.

546
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,203
So we're scanning bark to get our normal map

547
00:24:12,543 --> 00:24:14,305
that we would be tiling on top for these details.

548
00:24:14,725 --> 00:24:16,547
So great increase in texture resolution

549
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:19,010
with very minimal impact on our texture budget.

550
00:24:20,097 --> 00:24:21,737
So now we have these photo scanned assets,

551
00:24:21,757 --> 00:24:24,398
which as I mentioned earlier, are quite high quality.

552
00:24:24,858 --> 00:24:26,439
So how does everything else fit into this?

553
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:28,440
With the old asset creation,

554
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,920
where you get to a certain level of quality

555
00:24:30,021 --> 00:24:31,281
with a certain amount of effort and tech.

556
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:33,062
Suddenly with photogrammetry,

557
00:24:33,582 --> 00:24:35,503
your increase in quality is significant

558
00:24:35,883 --> 00:24:38,044
because of the tech and the techniques,

559
00:24:38,264 --> 00:24:39,504
not necessarily because of the effort.

560
00:24:40,004 --> 00:24:41,745
So when you're unable to use that technique

561
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,026
for an asset that won't...

562
00:24:43,906 --> 00:24:45,607
that doesn't lend itself to photo scanning,

563
00:24:46,147 --> 00:24:48,148
how do you bridge that gap?

564
00:24:48,168 --> 00:24:50,248
You can't just have this massive increase in effort.

565
00:24:50,528 --> 00:24:51,989
It's not particularly practical to do that.

566
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,990
And there's not necessarily a bunch of,

567
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,931
or a technique that will magically fill this deficit.

568
00:24:56,951 --> 00:24:58,071
So now we're gonna talk a little bit about,

569
00:24:58,211 --> 00:24:59,172
I'm gonna talk a little bit about

570
00:24:59,972 --> 00:25:03,053
some of the ways that we worked our photo scanned assets

571
00:25:03,093 --> 00:25:04,093
together with our game assets.

572
00:25:04,947 --> 00:25:06,689
And one of those was PBR technology,

573
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:08,810
as I mentioned in the offsets.

574
00:25:09,391 --> 00:25:10,491
Some quick thoughts on this.

575
00:25:11,112 --> 00:25:12,893
It is one of those things that helps us bridge the gap.

576
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,214
It creates a consistent look

577
00:25:14,475 --> 00:25:16,576
because of the way physically-based rendering works.

578
00:25:16,736 --> 00:25:17,977
I won't go into detail about PBR

579
00:25:17,997 --> 00:25:19,919
because that's an entirely separate subject.

580
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:23,501
We had the benefit of learning from our predecessors.

581
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:25,683
We were a little bit late in terms of our implementation

582
00:25:25,763 --> 00:25:30,647
to the PBR game, so we looked at what other studios had done

583
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:32,368
when they rolled out this technology,

584
00:25:32,568 --> 00:25:33,709
and we were able to learn from that.

585
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:37,121
And one of those for rolling out a new technology

586
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:38,923
was that if you try to get everyone to switch

587
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:42,927
at the same time or try to force this disruptive feature

588
00:25:43,027 --> 00:25:45,229
onto someone, onto an entire team at once,

589
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:46,510
that you'll have people who resist

590
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,852
and then it can backfire in terms of your adoption rate.

591
00:25:49,973 --> 00:25:51,735
But there are people who will get it instantly

592
00:25:51,775 --> 00:25:53,177
and they'll take it and they'll run

593
00:25:53,197 --> 00:25:55,259
and they'll be doing really great work with it

594
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:57,801
and those will be able to lead your team.

595
00:25:57,821 --> 00:25:58,762
So give it to the people that.

596
00:25:59,496 --> 00:26:01,817
adapt it early and let them lead the rest of the team.

597
00:26:01,858 --> 00:26:03,999
Because with PBR, there really isn't a middle road.

598
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,441
You can't half do PBR.

599
00:26:05,641 --> 00:26:07,162
It doesn't really work that way.

600
00:26:08,803 --> 00:26:11,526
So, the benefits that we got from PBR

601
00:26:11,546 --> 00:26:12,727
were that assets fit together.

602
00:26:12,987 --> 00:26:15,089
That's the whole point of a physically based render.

603
00:26:15,489 --> 00:26:16,810
But they do still need to be balanced

604
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,793
from an artistic direction against the scene.

605
00:26:21,026 --> 00:26:23,988
And finding true PBR values, because it's physically based,

606
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:26,249
it's not 100% physically accurate,

607
00:26:26,449 --> 00:26:27,250
can be difficult at times,

608
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,211
especially with things like blacks.

609
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:31,032
So we found that it was really important

610
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:35,935
to constantly reinforce the knowledge

611
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:39,257
and the way of working within the PBR environment

612
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:40,819
so that the results were consistent

613
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,340
during the course of the project.

614
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,381
This was big for us, kind of constantly coming back

615
00:26:46,042 --> 00:26:46,702
to sort of training.

616
00:26:46,782 --> 00:26:47,183
Here's a quick.

617
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,868
slideshow of the different render layers,

618
00:26:50,268 --> 00:26:51,689
because it's always kind of cool to see that.

619
00:27:04,392 --> 00:27:05,272
And our final result.

620
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:11,874
Yeah, so vegetation, obviously, like I mentioned before,

621
00:27:12,034 --> 00:27:13,554
we couldn't scan because it's too noisy.

622
00:27:14,154 --> 00:27:14,995
So this is something we had to.

623
00:27:15,802 --> 00:27:17,202
look at other techniques of getting in,

624
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:19,823
but it still had to fit within the whole photogrammetry

625
00:27:20,503 --> 00:27:21,383
world that we're creating,

626
00:27:22,063 --> 00:27:23,684
so that was certainly a challenge,

627
00:27:25,064 --> 00:27:26,624
as well as reaching 60 FPS.

628
00:27:27,204 --> 00:27:28,744
With building a photogrammetry world,

629
00:27:28,764 --> 00:27:30,105
I mean, it becomes quite realistic,

630
00:27:30,165 --> 00:27:31,925
so the vegetation and the density of vegetation

631
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:34,345
also need to be realistic to kind of keep up

632
00:27:34,365 --> 00:27:35,006
to that standard.

633
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,186
So we'd integrate hand-built vegetation, basically,

634
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,427
that we, as close as possible, was comparable

635
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:43,987
to the quality of the photoscan assets.

636
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:48,572
As I mentioned, we opted for that because of the scans being

637
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:50,975
too blobby and things like that.

638
00:27:52,316 --> 00:27:54,459
These were captured on a blue board.

639
00:27:55,239 --> 00:27:57,762
So I think you saw an image before where we lay out

640
00:27:57,782 --> 00:28:00,565
these as straight as we can on the blue boards,

641
00:28:00,705 --> 00:28:02,988
ranging from ferns from green all the way to the dead

642
00:28:03,028 --> 00:28:06,191
so we can reconstruct a fern based on photo reference.

643
00:28:07,689 --> 00:28:12,392
All the vegetation in Endor would share the same textures.

644
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:15,654
So it was just a few atlases and separating the textures

645
00:28:15,674 --> 00:28:19,276
from close to far so we can lay them out in billboards.

646
00:28:21,318 --> 00:28:22,538
And there was a huge amount of texture packing,

647
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:23,779
just like everything else in Battlefront.

648
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,221
Quite a lot, especially vegetation,

649
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:28,862
because it was naturally something that was tricky

650
00:28:28,882 --> 00:28:32,425
to get into performance right up until the last days, basically.

651
00:28:33,544 --> 00:28:35,185
And normals, as we went to photo scanning,

652
00:28:35,205 --> 00:28:37,446
the normals had to be created by hand.

653
00:28:37,526 --> 00:28:41,308
So those were created in Maya by modeling the shapes

654
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:45,171
roughly around these kind of atlases we would build.

655
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:46,892
And those give pretty good results

656
00:28:46,932 --> 00:28:51,995
combined with other tools such as Endo and things like that.

657
00:28:52,135 --> 00:28:53,296
Nothing too special about the way

658
00:28:53,316 --> 00:28:54,997
the vegetation was built in particular.

659
00:28:55,037 --> 00:28:56,638
It was a photo scan based at the bottom

660
00:28:57,338 --> 00:28:58,259
from the trips we went on.

661
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:02,261
And then it would just blend into a tiling texture

662
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:02,601
at the top.

663
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:10,123
We would also work pretty hard on blending assets

664
00:29:10,224 --> 00:29:11,164
into the terrain itself.

665
00:29:12,045 --> 00:29:14,586
We wanted to kind of get rid of that visible cut

666
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:19,329
to not remove the illusion of a photo scan environment.

667
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,590
And this kind of went through all the passes,

668
00:29:21,651 --> 00:29:24,252
not just the assets, the textures themselves,

669
00:29:24,272 --> 00:29:26,754
but we needed to go through radiosity and light

670
00:29:26,794 --> 00:29:27,554
and all that kind of stuff.

671
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:31,456
So it was a challenge to get it blending seamlessly.

672
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,914
Another one of the features we had implemented for us was mesh displacement.

673
00:29:38,034 --> 00:29:42,878
This actually came from, I believe, the Dragon Age team, and we took it from them and used it.

674
00:29:42,978 --> 00:29:48,423
This was a huge quality boost for us, and for what it's worth, we found that a distance of about 7 meters

675
00:29:48,483 --> 00:29:51,925
was all that we really needed to have the mesh displacement active,

676
00:29:53,046 --> 00:29:55,708
because this was kind of an ongoing balance between performance and quality.

677
00:29:55,828 --> 00:30:01,333
So, here's an example of mesh displacement off, and with our mesh displacement on.

678
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:05,382
Mesh displacement also led to terrain displacement

679
00:30:05,422 --> 00:30:06,843
and height field displacement,

680
00:30:06,883 --> 00:30:10,185
which is also something that was implemented

681
00:30:10,205 --> 00:30:11,066
by the Dragon Age team.

682
00:30:12,447 --> 00:30:15,429
So we were able to define the displacement shape

683
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:16,510
via a mask on the terrain.

684
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,711
This was actually one of our must-have features.

685
00:30:18,771 --> 00:30:20,352
It sounds maybe somewhat trivial,

686
00:30:20,392 --> 00:30:23,554
but we have these giant AT-ATs stomping around our levels,

687
00:30:23,854 --> 00:30:26,136
and we knew that we wanted them to be affecting

688
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:26,997
the terrain that they were on,

689
00:30:27,037 --> 00:30:28,778
especially when we're on a level like Hoth, which is snow.

690
00:30:30,213 --> 00:30:33,314
We have a terrain decal component within our terrain system

691
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:35,975
that allows us to combine the height field displacement

692
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:37,715
with the detail displacement shader.

693
00:30:37,755 --> 00:30:40,256
So a low level displacement to create the actual

694
00:30:40,676 --> 00:30:44,437
physics displacement along with the nice mesh displacement.

695
00:30:44,957 --> 00:30:46,758
And I'll go into this a little bit more in a bit.

696
00:30:49,406 --> 00:30:55,847
But it's worth mentioning that because photogrammetry does afford you this nice quality vs speed ratio,

697
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:57,368
and the quality vs speed ratio is very high,

698
00:30:58,128 --> 00:31:01,089
you can get creative. You don't have to worry about kind of playing around.

699
00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:05,350
So this was kind of a fun, I would say experiment, except we actually ended up using this.

700
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:11,091
So we went to the hardware store and kind of fashioned ourselves a close approximation to an AT-AT foot.

701
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:15,743
We got a tub of flour and stamped it into the flour,

702
00:31:16,364 --> 00:31:18,965
scanned it in, got a result like this,

703
00:31:19,426 --> 00:31:21,747
and to be honest, in less than a day,

704
00:31:21,807 --> 00:31:23,608
we had this prototype working.

705
00:31:24,629 --> 00:31:27,110
This is the absolute very first test,

706
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,112
so you see popping and things like that,

707
00:31:29,132 --> 00:31:30,032
so this isn't what we ship with,

708
00:31:30,072 --> 00:31:33,254
but just really great to show how you can prototype

709
00:31:33,795 --> 00:31:35,075
high-quality results and techniques

710
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:37,577
without that much investment.

711
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,832
Oh, so terrain, yes, speaking of.

712
00:31:41,392 --> 00:31:42,934
This is kind of the final big chunk

713
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:44,715
of our photogrammetry puzzle.

714
00:31:48,978 --> 00:31:52,020
Yeah, so terrain in Frostbite

715
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,542
has a pretty extensive terrain system.

716
00:31:54,182 --> 00:31:56,284
And for Battlefront, it was typically

717
00:31:56,704 --> 00:31:58,025
eight by eight kilometer terrains.

718
00:31:58,325 --> 00:32:01,207
And you'd play in about a one kilometer space, roughly.

719
00:32:02,248 --> 00:32:03,649
And the detail from that one kilometer

720
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:07,192
would be lower and lower the further you get away

721
00:32:07,232 --> 00:32:08,313
from the center point.

722
00:32:09,848 --> 00:32:13,131
I would complement this with really large backdrop meshes,

723
00:32:13,511 --> 00:32:15,733
just regular backdrop meshes to extend the vista

724
00:32:15,773 --> 00:32:16,853
much further into the distance.

725
00:32:17,754 --> 00:32:19,836
And all the textures for this were captured

726
00:32:19,976 --> 00:32:21,697
just like you saw in the presentation before

727
00:32:21,777 --> 00:32:23,198
with the photogrammetry.

728
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,781
And performance on the terrain,

729
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:30,044
we need to keep the amount of layers as limited as possible.

730
00:32:30,144 --> 00:32:33,146
So we had to pick and choose the most important

731
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,728
sort of surface that would make up the terrain itself.

732
00:32:37,527 --> 00:32:40,569
We used to work with World Machine a lot more,

733
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,832
on BF3 and 4 days, and that was great back then.

734
00:32:44,872 --> 00:32:46,693
It kind of fit within the style that we're going for.

735
00:32:47,313 --> 00:32:49,315
But going into Battlefront with much more

736
00:32:49,335 --> 00:32:50,836
photo scan characters and things like that,

737
00:32:50,876 --> 00:32:54,438
we need to make sure the photo scan assets up close

738
00:32:54,838 --> 00:32:57,700
would blend to a realistic background,

739
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,981
and World Machine just wasn't really cutting it.

740
00:33:00,994 --> 00:33:03,456
This is where we got with the topography data,

741
00:33:03,997 --> 00:33:07,720
using real-world data, and supplementing that on top

742
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,662
with all the photo-scanned surfaces and things.

743
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:13,886
We get the usual kind of maps.

744
00:33:13,946 --> 00:33:15,348
So we get a height map and a color map.

745
00:33:15,908 --> 00:33:19,251
And from that, we'd implement it into the Frostbite terrain

746
00:33:19,271 --> 00:33:19,511
system.

747
00:33:21,663 --> 00:33:24,367
And here's just a quick shot of the extended backdrop.

748
00:33:24,387 --> 00:33:25,228
So this is mesh.

749
00:33:25,368 --> 00:33:28,032
It's probably around about 70,000 triangles or something.

750
00:33:28,914 --> 00:33:31,357
And when working on Battlefield previously,

751
00:33:31,377 --> 00:33:35,123
we were generally creating more of a level in a bucket

752
00:33:35,283 --> 00:33:37,066
where the sizes were compressed.

753
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:40,094
As we're going for all these realistic visuals

754
00:33:40,174 --> 00:33:41,315
in this project, we wanted to make sure

755
00:33:41,355 --> 00:33:43,796
that even the distances were realistic themselves.

756
00:33:43,836 --> 00:33:46,777
So the distances here are literally 40 kilometers

757
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,817
into the distance, which would work great

758
00:33:48,857 --> 00:33:52,999
with all the proper fog values and all those elements.

759
00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:57,881
Yeah, so a bit on the texture capture.

760
00:33:59,961 --> 00:34:01,642
Again, we didn't really use any special rigs for this.

761
00:34:01,662 --> 00:34:05,764
We just kind of tried to hone in on a standard that we used.

762
00:34:07,802 --> 00:34:10,303
So it was roughly a three by three or four by four

763
00:34:10,803 --> 00:34:13,325
patch of terrain in the real world.

764
00:34:14,525 --> 00:34:15,846
About five by five photos.

765
00:34:16,266 --> 00:34:19,267
It was generally enough overlap in most cases.

766
00:34:20,548 --> 00:34:22,488
And always capturing just one defined element

767
00:34:22,708 --> 00:34:24,509
such as just gravel or just sand

768
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:28,031
as in the frostbite terrain we'd do all the blending

769
00:34:28,051 --> 00:34:30,131
between those in the system itself.

770
00:34:32,146 --> 00:34:35,348
In our case, low ISO and high f-stop worked best.

771
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:37,289
That does introduce quite a bit of grain,

772
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:40,451
but that was much less of a problem than blurry edges

773
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,413
when you bring it into Photoscan, so it worked best for us.

774
00:34:44,993 --> 00:34:48,115
And again, the point of not focusing on noisy surfaces,

775
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:49,816
it was just not worth the effort.

776
00:34:51,597 --> 00:34:53,098
Here's a few examples of capturing snow,

777
00:34:53,118 --> 00:34:55,300
which was interesting because we weren't even sure

778
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,381
this trip was gonna work, but it was,

779
00:34:58,402 --> 00:35:00,223
resulted in some of the best scans we had.

780
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:06,816
Yeah, so in Battlefield, we didn't have terrain tessellation,

781
00:35:07,196 --> 00:35:09,418
so this was new for us on this project.

782
00:35:09,918 --> 00:35:11,599
It was a huge quality boost,

783
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:14,020
which we absolutely could not go back.

784
00:35:14,581 --> 00:35:17,943
I would rather remove something else rather than this one.

785
00:35:20,484 --> 00:35:22,345
It would stop at only about 15 meters,

786
00:35:22,385 --> 00:35:24,707
which sounds pretty short, but in the game

787
00:35:24,727 --> 00:35:26,788
when you're running around with all the other detail,

788
00:35:26,868 --> 00:35:30,130
it was far enough, and the performance of this

789
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,130
was pretty trivial, actually.

790
00:35:32,575 --> 00:35:35,257
So here's terrain without displacement, which we had

791
00:35:35,317 --> 00:35:38,800
previously, and in Battlefront, when we enabled that to only

792
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,301
about 15 meters, it did the trick.

793
00:35:43,564 --> 00:35:45,586
So basically everything we've been talking about leads to

794
00:35:45,606 --> 00:35:47,668
these things called level construction kits, as we call

795
00:35:47,708 --> 00:35:52,151
it, and that is essentially a package of

796
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:56,867
all the props and surfaces and things we've captured

797
00:35:56,887 --> 00:35:59,328
on location and built into a small package

798
00:35:59,928 --> 00:36:02,149
of usable pieces within that biome

799
00:36:02,169 --> 00:36:04,730
to keep it all into one nice little location.

800
00:36:06,351 --> 00:36:10,233
It was great for us, especially going into production,

801
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,514
these were pretty much finished,

802
00:36:11,614 --> 00:36:14,315
so we could focus more on building fun levels

803
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:16,296
and iterating rather than trying to build up

804
00:36:16,316 --> 00:36:17,056
the quality too much.

805
00:36:17,076 --> 00:36:20,998
Yeah, definitely shift the focus.

806
00:36:22,426 --> 00:36:25,428
And as these were very self-contained packages,

807
00:36:25,688 --> 00:36:27,530
it naturally meant that the performance

808
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,412
was quite easily understandable.

809
00:36:30,912 --> 00:36:32,394
There was no kind of outside influences

810
00:36:32,434 --> 00:36:33,635
being pulled into this biome,

811
00:36:33,715 --> 00:36:36,857
so what was in there was very, very quick to understand

812
00:36:36,917 --> 00:36:38,819
and keep track of throughout production.

813
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,843
What it would include is the eight by eight kilometer terrain

814
00:36:44,964 --> 00:36:46,945
along with the big backdrop meshes, of course,

815
00:36:47,746 --> 00:36:50,308
the ready-to-paint terrain materials.

816
00:36:52,248 --> 00:36:55,710
And the library of assets, which was easily accessible

817
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:57,251
and categorized in our database.

818
00:36:57,331 --> 00:36:59,793
So again, not pulling in outside influences,

819
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:01,213
which would affect performance and things.

820
00:37:02,734 --> 00:37:04,856
And at the beginning, some lighting presets

821
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:05,736
based on the films.

822
00:37:05,896 --> 00:37:08,238
So we really nailed the look that we're going for early on

823
00:37:08,338 --> 00:37:09,439
while we're prototyping levels.

824
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:12,741
And we have one of these for each of the planets

825
00:37:13,121 --> 00:37:14,061
that we shift with.

826
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:18,484
We also built more of these kits in production

827
00:37:18,524 --> 00:37:21,126
when we needed more variety, such as the.

828
00:37:22,671 --> 00:37:24,292
the Jawa Canyon red cliffs.

829
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:31,836
Here's a short video on just using one of these kits.

830
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:34,837
So here I'm just illustrating how we can easily

831
00:37:34,897 --> 00:37:37,118
place out the objects that are connected to this biome,

832
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:40,240
painting out materials that are already ready to go

833
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,581
with the ferns and that procedure to distribute.

834
00:37:43,922 --> 00:37:46,263
Just shows kind of how fun it is to play around with these

835
00:37:47,444 --> 00:37:48,665
with the visuals already up to quality.

836
00:37:51,892 --> 00:37:59,875
The idea going into the level construction kits was that eventually anyone could take them and create a space or a level that would be functional for the game.

837
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:04,476
And I would say that that's still the goal, but we ran into basically production time limitations.

838
00:38:05,117 --> 00:38:08,738
But these are very much intended to be used by effectively anyone. That was very much the goal.

839
00:38:10,279 --> 00:38:16,561
And then the idea being that you could get very high quality results with very minimal effort because the kits were doing so well.

840
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,140
And here's another example of Tatooine just showing,

841
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,082
as you saw, it went from the LIDAR backdrop

842
00:38:28,102 --> 00:38:30,584
down to the ground, and it's already very highly detailed

843
00:38:30,604 --> 00:38:34,727
with the procedural shaders distributed across the terrain

844
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:36,048
based on angles and things like that.

845
00:38:36,328 --> 00:38:38,289
But here's just filling it out with more details

846
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:39,970
and also showing the blending.

847
00:38:40,191 --> 00:38:41,472
As you scale the assets up and down,

848
00:38:41,512 --> 00:38:43,513
the detail stays the same size,

849
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:46,415
so it's all relative to the landscape details.

850
00:38:46,435 --> 00:38:52,379
And this is actually slowed down time.

851
00:38:55,171 --> 00:38:56,189
Our artists are really fast.

852
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:06,530
So this shot, which you saw before, this is just to

853
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:08,251
illustrate a point.

854
00:39:08,371 --> 00:39:09,432
Here is what it looks like.

855
00:39:09,592 --> 00:39:10,413
A lot of variation.

856
00:39:11,294 --> 00:39:13,636
It's hard to see kind of repeating assets and where

857
00:39:13,676 --> 00:39:14,096
things end.

858
00:39:15,097 --> 00:39:18,640
But in reality, it's only built up of a few pieces.

859
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,442
And this was the point of these level construction kits,

860
00:39:21,462 --> 00:39:23,764
that we keep it very small and self-contained.

861
00:39:23,844 --> 00:39:27,046
So each asset could be very well maintained, brought up to

862
00:39:27,066 --> 00:39:29,148
quality, and tracked very easily.

863
00:39:30,216 --> 00:39:32,257
They're very generic, so placing these around was

864
00:39:33,678 --> 00:39:35,419
hard to see the repetition in most cases.

865
00:39:36,299 --> 00:39:38,380
And it's the same goes for all the planets.

866
00:39:38,721 --> 00:39:41,122
The same kind of very simple kits

867
00:39:42,263 --> 00:39:43,263
to build up the landscapes.

868
00:39:45,584 --> 00:39:47,505
And Tataouine probably being the best example to show

869
00:39:48,126 --> 00:39:51,648
where the, well basically where not the connection lays

870
00:39:51,688 --> 00:39:53,309
between objects and the terrain.

871
00:39:53,569 --> 00:39:55,270
Working very hard on the blending between them.

872
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:58,551
With very few pieces again.

873
00:40:02,331 --> 00:40:03,112
And cellist.

874
00:40:05,253 --> 00:40:05,813
Same goes here.

875
00:40:12,418 --> 00:40:15,480
Here's just a very quick slideshow, essentially just to

876
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,861
show the variation we have throughout the game with a lot

877
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:19,542
of these kits that we created.

878
00:40:19,562 --> 00:40:23,485
And I think the use of them was spread quite far.

879
00:40:23,645 --> 00:40:27,267
And it goes to show that even very generic assets could make

880
00:40:27,307 --> 00:40:28,628
up quite interesting locations.

881
00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:54,111
So, some of our key learnings and takeaways.

882
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:59,603
Having this process in place before production began

883
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:00,283
was a huge win.

884
00:41:00,383 --> 00:41:01,964
Like I actually can't really understate that.

885
00:41:02,524 --> 00:41:06,626
We spent a lot of time and effort in the beginning days

886
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:08,847
and months of pre-production,

887
00:41:08,907 --> 00:41:10,047
kind of getting this stuff in place.

888
00:41:10,087 --> 00:41:11,808
And we actually had the level of construction kits

889
00:41:11,868 --> 00:41:14,149
almost entirely in place before production began,

890
00:41:14,749 --> 00:41:15,889
effectively entirely in place.

891
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,211
Certainly not at shippable quality, but at usable quality.

892
00:41:19,671 --> 00:41:23,472
And this was just a great benefit for us

893
00:41:23,552 --> 00:41:23,832
because...

894
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,988
We love kind of white box design and doing

895
00:41:28,308 --> 00:41:29,768
prototypes and things in that method,

896
00:41:29,848 --> 00:41:33,129
but all too often you have that situation where

897
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:35,630
your less creative people will come up and say like,

898
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,330
oh but how will it be when it's done?

899
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,811
When will it, how much more fun will it be when it's done?

900
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,331
What do you mean when it's done?

901
00:41:41,591 --> 00:41:43,852
And this actually completely bypassed that problem,

902
00:41:43,872 --> 00:41:44,732
I would say, during our production.

903
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:46,052
We never had that case where people were like,

904
00:41:46,572 --> 00:41:48,433
oh well, this is pretty cool, but we'll see

905
00:41:48,453 --> 00:41:49,773
what it looks like when the things are complete.

906
00:41:49,973 --> 00:41:53,254
Like, I never heard that phrase uttered during production.

907
00:41:53,674 --> 00:41:54,714
I'm not saying it couldn't be uttered,

908
00:41:54,754 --> 00:41:54,854
but.

909
00:41:55,334 --> 00:41:56,595
but it really helps that problem.

910
00:41:58,076 --> 00:42:00,537
Yeah, and having well-planned and structured

911
00:42:00,577 --> 00:42:02,578
photogrammetry trips was essential

912
00:42:02,598 --> 00:42:03,499
in having clean results.

913
00:42:03,879 --> 00:42:05,920
We really made sure, before we went on them,

914
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,081
we had great lists and knew what we're going into

915
00:42:09,002 --> 00:42:10,202
to capture the environments.

916
00:42:10,262 --> 00:42:11,783
I think that was very key.

917
00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:17,226
So yeah, we've talked about sort of craftsmanship

918
00:42:17,346 --> 00:42:20,008
and really photogrammetry is just one of the tools

919
00:42:20,408 --> 00:42:23,310
in our belt to sort of help us achieve that.

920
00:42:24,058 --> 00:42:26,320
what was our core pillar for production of craftsmanship,

921
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:29,443
focusing on the quality of the assets they were building

922
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,745
and trying to keep everything to a very high standard.

923
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:35,669
There were people, especially, again,

924
00:42:35,709 --> 00:42:37,911
like on the maybe management executive level,

925
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:40,274
who saw, or you'd hear the photogrammetry buzzword,

926
00:42:40,294 --> 00:42:42,256
and like, ah, photogrammetry, that'll save everything,

927
00:42:42,276 --> 00:42:43,617
that'll solve all the problems.

928
00:42:43,897 --> 00:42:46,339
But it's, like all technology, that's not the case.

929
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:48,301
This is, it's just a tool in our belt.

930
00:42:50,388 --> 00:42:51,929
Yeah, so everything you saw here,

931
00:42:51,949 --> 00:42:54,771
I mean, they're built by a very small team of artists,

932
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:58,053
and it was crucial to have these artists owning their planets

933
00:42:58,113 --> 00:42:59,854
and owning the art that we're doing.

934
00:42:59,874 --> 00:43:02,035
They were responsible for going on the trips,

935
00:43:02,435 --> 00:43:04,317
processing the data, building the levels.

936
00:43:04,397 --> 00:43:05,717
So they went through the entire pipeline.

937
00:43:05,777 --> 00:43:08,359
I think that was key in getting consistent results

938
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,400
and keeping on track with everything.

939
00:43:14,164 --> 00:43:16,325
Working towards PBR was an ongoing process,

940
00:43:16,665 --> 00:43:17,225
as I mentioned.

941
00:43:17,366 --> 00:43:18,906
Actually, there's a quick little anecdote I can give

942
00:43:18,946 --> 00:43:20,507
about PBR that I meant to give during the slide,

943
00:43:20,547 --> 00:43:23,388
where, speaking of the values and kind of making sure

944
00:43:23,428 --> 00:43:25,449
that everyone was maintaining the standards of PBR,

945
00:43:25,729 --> 00:43:28,130
we had on Endor a case where all the values

946
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,031
were about 30% brighter than they should be.

947
00:43:30,832 --> 00:43:32,432
But it's really hard to tell because the exposure

948
00:43:32,452 --> 00:43:36,214
would compensate down for that increased intensity.

949
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,295
And as a result, everything in that level

950
00:43:38,335 --> 00:43:41,336
was like unexpectedly dark, and we couldn't figure it out

951
00:43:41,376 --> 00:43:43,097
why for the longest time, and it was just because

952
00:43:43,918 --> 00:43:49,147
We ended up having to go in and doing a pics capture or something and reading the values and seeing that we were about 20 30 percent

953
00:43:49,447 --> 00:43:54,035
Brighter than we should have been so it just emphasized that you kind of constantly have to be checking

954
00:43:54,897 --> 00:43:55,598
Checking your values

955
00:43:57,732 --> 00:43:58,793
Yeah, we mentioned this a few times,

956
00:43:58,833 --> 00:43:59,814
but much of the process was,

957
00:43:59,834 --> 00:44:02,116
it is brute force and it is manual.

958
00:44:02,856 --> 00:44:04,658
And it would get faster as artists got better at it,

959
00:44:04,798 --> 00:44:06,579
but I think there's so much room here

960
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:08,721
for proceduralism, for automation.

961
00:44:08,741 --> 00:44:10,823
It's just that there's a lot of potential wins.

962
00:44:11,343 --> 00:44:12,965
And I'm sure you guys can kind of imagine

963
00:44:13,005 --> 00:44:15,126
even after watching this presentation.

964
00:44:15,146 --> 00:44:16,648
Yeah, same thing here.

965
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:18,449
Just a lot of manual labor, brute force.

966
00:44:20,851 --> 00:44:21,632
I think we have a...

967
00:44:21,972 --> 00:44:25,275
I think it's a quick reel of final results, basically,

968
00:44:25,415 --> 00:44:25,975
that we should put.

969
00:44:26,596 --> 00:44:27,296
So sit back.

970
00:44:38,691 --> 00:44:46,112
All I need is a little bit more

971
00:44:46,132 --> 00:44:48,873
Someday I'll be sitting in a dry well

972
00:45:27,498 --> 00:45:27,558
You

973
00:46:52,733 --> 00:46:52,795
you

974
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:13,710
Thank you very much.

975
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,491
We really wanted to have a special thanks slide on here.

976
00:48:16,551 --> 00:48:19,433
Unfortunately, it was really hard to not put everyone on,

977
00:48:19,633 --> 00:48:22,114
but this group of people represents

978
00:48:22,614 --> 00:48:23,655
actually a lot of the work that you've seen,

979
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:25,355
and also those who were, I would say,

980
00:48:25,396 --> 00:48:28,597
directly kind of impacting our photogrammetry efforts.

981
00:48:28,837 --> 00:48:30,098
We would thank everyone if we could,

982
00:48:30,178 --> 00:48:33,119
but these guys in particular were kind of instrumental

983
00:48:33,159 --> 00:48:35,700
in helping us kind of achieve our photo scanning goals.

984
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:37,841
And thanks to you as well.

985
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:41,441
This, we actually ended this somehow 10 minutes early.

986
00:48:41,461 --> 00:48:43,163
This is like, in all of our,

987
00:48:43,183 --> 00:48:44,284
well, yeah, about 10 minutes early,

988
00:48:44,524 --> 00:48:45,565
which is 10 minutes faster

989
00:48:45,585 --> 00:48:47,687
than every one of our run-throughs.

990
00:48:47,707 --> 00:48:49,068
But that's great, plenty of time for questions.

991
00:48:49,549 --> 00:48:51,030
I didn't think we were gonna have any time for questions.

992
00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:51,971
So if you have them,

993
00:48:52,271 --> 00:48:55,614
please head to the mics and throw them at us.

994
00:49:00,118 --> 00:49:00,218
Hello.

995
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:06,344
Great work, thank you for sharing this work with us today.

996
00:49:07,224 --> 00:49:11,447
I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about

997
00:49:12,648 --> 00:49:14,149
substance designer and painter

998
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:16,751
and procedural texturing in general.

999
00:49:17,132 --> 00:49:18,232
Have you considered this?

1000
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:19,834
Have you evaluated these tools?

1001
00:49:19,934 --> 00:49:22,936
And how do you think it may complement your approach?

1002
00:49:23,316 --> 00:49:28,420
Yeah, so Battlefronts, our primary painting software

1003
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,541
was actually Mari, which...

1004
00:49:30,382 --> 00:49:31,062
the artists loved.

1005
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:35,845
And actually within EA, there are several teams,

1006
00:49:35,865 --> 00:49:37,686
there are several people using Substance as well.

1007
00:49:37,966 --> 00:49:39,567
We haven't incorporated any sort of

1008
00:49:39,647 --> 00:49:40,687
Substance painter stuff yet,

1009
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:41,788
but we really like the software.

1010
00:49:42,448 --> 00:49:44,689
The kind of generic answers that we're

1011
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:46,350
always kind of evaluating.

1012
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:48,732
It's actually one of the things that the studio

1013
00:49:48,772 --> 00:49:50,653
is trying to get us to align a little bit more

1014
00:49:50,733 --> 00:49:51,353
consistently around,

1015
00:49:51,373 --> 00:49:52,534
because we're kind of all over the place,

1016
00:49:52,794 --> 00:49:53,534
but we love that stuff.

1017
00:49:53,654 --> 00:49:55,555
Like, all that software is really cool.

1018
00:49:56,296 --> 00:49:56,536
Thank you.

1019
00:49:58,678 --> 00:50:02,880
Hey, so I was curious about how you set up,

1020
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,221
like when you see the edge of the tree

1021
00:50:05,581 --> 00:50:07,842
or the edge of the snow, how you would see,

1022
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,983
like how, was that all just displacement?

1023
00:50:10,003 --> 00:50:11,823
Because it looked like some of it might be cards.

1024
00:50:12,323 --> 00:50:13,104
Or like moss.

1025
00:50:13,264 --> 00:50:14,724
Yeah, so the trees in particular,

1026
00:50:14,764 --> 00:50:18,326
they were maybe up to about 20 meters or less

1027
00:50:18,366 --> 00:50:20,847
that were regular meshes with displacement.

1028
00:50:21,367 --> 00:50:23,288
The displacement would fade away quite quickly.

1029
00:50:23,308 --> 00:50:25,409
And then maybe in 60 meters it was.

1030
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:26,849
He's talking about barskis moss.

1031
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:28,010
Oh, the moss.

1032
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:29,030
Yeah, it's really cool.

1033
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,931
Oh yeah, that's just cards, regular cards.

1034
00:50:32,471 --> 00:50:34,932
We have a technical artist wrote basically a script

1035
00:50:34,992 --> 00:50:38,353
that would parent in a kind of creative, efficient way

1036
00:50:38,753 --> 00:50:40,214
a bunch of cards to surfaces.

1037
00:50:40,734 --> 00:50:42,695
And yeah, it created really awesome results.

1038
00:50:42,855 --> 00:50:44,876
Actually, it's totally kind of a hack,

1039
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:45,876
but it looks really good.

1040
00:50:45,916 --> 00:50:47,937
Yeah, it just looks like it's just on the edges.

1041
00:50:48,237 --> 00:50:50,277
Yeah, there's no special techniques there.

1042
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,018
Hey guys, fantastic work.

1043
00:50:53,198 --> 00:50:55,179
I was hoping you could talk a little about

1044
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:57,200
how you source the real world terrain data.

1045
00:50:57,802 --> 00:51:05,287
And also maybe a little bit how the texture array detail texturing stuff worked with the blending between the terrain and your terrain meshes.

1046
00:51:05,692 --> 00:51:10,513
Yeah, so sourcing the data, we looked around quite

1047
00:51:10,553 --> 00:51:11,433
extensively for that.

1048
00:51:11,733 --> 00:51:13,714
I mean, that stuff can get extremely expensive.

1049
00:51:14,534 --> 00:51:15,955
But if you search the internet, there's places like

1050
00:51:16,035 --> 00:51:17,215
opentopography.org.

1051
00:51:17,955 --> 00:51:21,616
They have free data with just the catch of giving them a

1052
00:51:21,656 --> 00:51:22,677
special thanks, basically.

1053
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:26,238
They pull in data from all places that supply it for free,

1054
00:51:26,258 --> 00:51:28,618
the old data that is now available, open source.

1055
00:51:29,739 --> 00:51:32,400
And that data changes all the time, so you're going to be

1056
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,580
lucky to catch the right one.

1057
00:51:35,306 --> 00:51:36,789
Other than that, they can get very expensive,

1058
00:51:37,369 --> 00:51:38,271
outside of free.

1059
00:51:40,374 --> 00:51:41,676
And the blending between,

1060
00:51:41,696 --> 00:51:44,781
it's about the objects to terrain was the question.

1061
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:54,478
Yeah, well, I didn't quite understand how the texture arrays worked with your terrain system being one thing and then your terrain meshes and being able to blend the edges.

1062
00:51:54,498 --> 00:52:00,620
We would primarily use the texture arrays as a way to introduce the detail maps on the actual objects within the scene.

1063
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:12,442
And then as far as objects blending with terrain, that's a shader feature that the engine has that allows you to sample the terrain beneath the object and create a blend between the object ends.

1064
00:52:12,682 --> 00:52:16,585
But then it was just the case of having the same tiling values on terrain and object to

1065
00:52:16,625 --> 00:52:18,226
make sure they were well projected.

1066
00:52:18,506 --> 00:52:19,507
So it would blend across.

1067
00:52:20,628 --> 00:52:23,210
Thanks.

1068
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:28,594
In your level design kits, you have a bunch of textures and a bunch of objects, but what

1069
00:52:28,634 --> 00:52:30,916
we saw was maybe like eight objects.

1070
00:52:30,996 --> 00:52:31,556
I was wondering...

1071
00:52:31,836 --> 00:52:32,196
That's it.

1072
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:33,277
That's it?

1073
00:52:33,597 --> 00:52:34,778
We showed everything there is there.

1074
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:35,539
That's impressive.

1075
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:35,939
Yeah.

1076
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:36,620
That's good.

1077
00:52:39,426 --> 00:52:48,568
Hey guys, I'm wondering if you thought about using photogrammetry for any non-organic, like industrial or architectural elements, and if not, would you do that in the future?

1078
00:52:48,849 --> 00:52:55,590
We did try a bit of that, but it was pretty quick to notice that it only worked very well for organic surfaces.

1079
00:52:56,951 --> 00:53:06,353
We did scan things from the archives, such as vehicles and things, but that was more for reference, shapes and proportions and things, but I don't think we ever used any...

1080
00:53:07,856 --> 00:53:09,297
photogrammetry for hard surface in the end.

1081
00:53:09,697 --> 00:53:14,160
But that being said, having scanned hard surface objects,

1082
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,022
particularly for volume and reference, was invaluable.

1083
00:53:17,082 --> 00:53:21,145
Because it's not usable, but it's great for sanity checking.

1084
00:53:24,027 --> 00:53:24,967
Great presentation, guys.

1085
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:27,249
Oh, that's loud, sorry.

1086
00:53:28,314 --> 00:53:30,716
Two questions for you is when you're going on your

1087
00:53:30,736 --> 00:53:33,258
photo shoots and taking a simple prop,

1088
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:36,100
is there a time where it's overkill in terms of

1089
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,121
the number of photos you're taking?

1090
00:53:37,541 --> 00:53:39,623
Yeah, well not really, I mean,

1091
00:53:39,643 --> 00:53:42,065
Yoho comes in the later part where too many photos

1092
00:53:42,325 --> 00:53:43,706
is just not gonna work out in the end

1093
00:53:43,726 --> 00:53:44,927
for running through photo scan,

1094
00:53:44,967 --> 00:53:46,828
but we generally end up somewhere between

1095
00:53:47,189 --> 00:53:48,870
200 and 300 photos for a single prop.

1096
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:51,252
That's with a few rotations around

1097
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:52,373
on different heights and angles.

1098
00:53:53,293 --> 00:53:55,695
So somewhere around there was kind of the ideal mark for us.

1099
00:53:56,258 --> 00:53:58,180
And if you're looking at software like RealityCapture,

1100
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,462
which is one of the newer ones out there,

1101
00:53:59,542 --> 00:54:01,624
which we've been using and it's really impressive,

1102
00:54:01,924 --> 00:54:04,127
they have this feature where you can take a series

1103
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:07,110
of images and then import images or any other source

1104
00:54:07,891 --> 00:54:09,994
scanning data later on and kind of keep building on it.

1105
00:54:10,074 --> 00:54:12,877
So it becomes maybe more of an issue,

1106
00:54:12,897 --> 00:54:14,119
but also maybe less of an issue too,

1107
00:54:14,179 --> 00:54:15,961
because it's more flexible in that sense.

1108
00:54:17,318 --> 00:54:19,560
Second question is, when you have this data

1109
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,382
and you're taking it back and trying to manipulate it,

1110
00:54:21,902 --> 00:54:24,585
is there, obviously, similar to how MoCap is,

1111
00:54:24,605 --> 00:54:27,328
where you can overwork it, what have you found that point

1112
00:54:27,648 --> 00:54:29,630
for this type of data and this type of workflow

1113
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:30,932
that you're kind of pushing it too far

1114
00:54:30,972 --> 00:54:31,673
and it just breaks it?

1115
00:54:31,993 --> 00:54:34,095
We actually had that slide removed,

1116
00:54:34,215 --> 00:54:35,877
but that was a point we wanted to bring up.

1117
00:54:37,834 --> 00:54:40,116
Working too much on photo scan data obviously ruins

1118
00:54:40,136 --> 00:54:42,318
the whole point of capturing something in the real world.

1119
00:54:42,338 --> 00:54:46,902
It's capturing all the imperfections with the asset.

1120
00:54:47,082 --> 00:54:49,204
So the more you work over and clean things up,

1121
00:54:49,264 --> 00:54:52,307
it removes that whole quality of a real world capture.

1122
00:54:53,368 --> 00:54:55,369
So we definitely try to limit that as much as possible.

1123
00:54:55,389 --> 00:54:57,211
It was more about just cleaning up,

1124
00:54:57,311 --> 00:54:59,173
pacing in details on things that didn't quite.

1125
00:54:59,945 --> 00:55:01,566
a scan world that created blobby parts,

1126
00:55:02,527 --> 00:55:03,348
cleaning up those things.

1127
00:55:03,708 --> 00:55:05,350
It really depends on what your final goals are too.

1128
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:07,151
Like in our case, we're going for believability.

1129
00:55:07,752 --> 00:55:10,033
So we found that really do as little as possible

1130
00:55:12,055 --> 00:55:15,158
with the manipulation, like keep it as simple as possible,

1131
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:16,499
do as little as you can to the texture.

1132
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:20,903
If you're looking to change the style

1133
00:55:20,923 --> 00:55:21,783
or the tone of your game,

1134
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,185
and just using photogrammetry as a source,

1135
00:55:23,205 --> 00:55:24,706
you could have kind of different goals, but yeah.

1136
00:55:25,807 --> 00:55:26,087
Thanks guys.

1137
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:27,010
Cool.

1138
00:55:27,551 --> 00:55:27,671
Hi.

1139
00:55:27,771 --> 00:55:28,291
Thanks for the talk.

1140
00:55:28,311 --> 00:55:29,491
Really interesting.

1141
00:55:30,011 --> 00:55:32,992
One of the final shots you had in your video there was of ice.

1142
00:55:33,832 --> 00:55:35,773
Now obviously, photographers are really good

1143
00:55:35,813 --> 00:55:38,474
with solid textures, non-reflective things,

1144
00:55:38,554 --> 00:55:39,874
things that are brightly lit.

1145
00:55:39,894 --> 00:55:42,315
Obviously, there's lots of depth with ice.

1146
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,875
There's kind of layering, and there's

1147
00:55:44,255 --> 00:55:45,476
like bubbles inside it and stuff.

1148
00:55:46,563 --> 00:55:47,644
How the hell did you do that?

1149
00:55:47,804 --> 00:55:52,388
Yes, so, I mean, we didn't actually scan clear ice.

1150
00:55:52,468 --> 00:55:54,069
Where we went, yeah, it's impossible.

1151
00:55:54,089 --> 00:55:56,972
But where we went to in Iceland, it was a glacier

1152
00:55:57,032 --> 00:55:59,554
which had basically the whole range from clear ice

1153
00:55:59,594 --> 00:56:01,235
all the way to ice that had been there for a long time

1154
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,636
and compacted with dirt and things.

1155
00:56:02,716 --> 00:56:05,679
So it was the same shapes, so we could capture the things

1156
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:07,080
that was more compact and solid

1157
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:09,902
and then work on the shaders in Frosted.

1158
00:56:10,302 --> 00:56:11,563
It was a little misleading having that one,

1159
00:56:11,603 --> 00:56:13,185
but it looks so cool, so you got there.

1160
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:14,406
Yeah, I thought that might be the answer.

1161
00:56:14,426 --> 00:56:15,066
Thanks, guys, cheers.

1162
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:16,913
Hi.

1163
00:56:17,553 --> 00:56:17,773
Hi.

1164
00:56:20,034 --> 00:56:23,135
Just first, it was the best photogrammetry I've ever seen.

1165
00:56:23,976 --> 00:56:25,236
Really great work.

1166
00:56:25,836 --> 00:56:30,298
I do a lot of photogrammetry and the way you compose them is really great.

1167
00:56:30,879 --> 00:56:37,421
But something that's difficult with photogrammetry is to get the materials to.

1168
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:42,743
And what you get with photogrammetry is good geometry, if you are lucky.

1169
00:56:43,364 --> 00:56:43,944
And the.

1170
00:56:45,084 --> 00:56:48,705
an albedo, you have to unlight your texture

1171
00:56:48,785 --> 00:56:50,426
and sometimes you have an albedo.

1172
00:56:51,126 --> 00:56:53,067
How do you get the full materials?

1173
00:56:53,127 --> 00:56:56,188
Is it something you have to make artistically?

1174
00:56:56,388 --> 00:56:58,648
Yeah, yeah, I mean, we kind of develop that

1175
00:56:58,668 --> 00:57:02,269
through the whole project, how we get to that material,

1176
00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:05,810
but from the first game capture we get the normal map

1177
00:57:05,931 --> 00:57:08,031
made from a high poly and diffuse,

1178
00:57:08,631 --> 00:57:10,892
and then we sometimes derive things like cavity map and things.

1179
00:57:12,453 --> 00:57:13,394
That was about it really.

1180
00:57:13,434 --> 00:57:15,535
Things like reflectance had to be created manually.

1181
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,558
We're not doing any sort of source,

1182
00:57:19,078 --> 00:57:20,779
I forget the names of the companies that do it,

1183
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,661
but you can, you know, they do the box captures

1184
00:57:22,681 --> 00:57:23,942
of the material, but we're not doing any of that

1185
00:57:24,002 --> 00:57:24,922
kind of stuff yet.

1186
00:57:24,963 --> 00:57:25,663
It's mixed in.

1187
00:57:25,683 --> 00:57:26,043
Yeah, yeah.

1188
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,605
But within EA, there are a lot of people

1189
00:57:29,006 --> 00:57:31,588
experimenting with different ways of capturing that data.

1190
00:57:32,228 --> 00:57:34,830
it'll make its way eventually to the game teams

1191
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:35,451
and stuff like that.

1192
00:57:35,631 --> 00:57:37,553
Using polarization.

1193
00:57:37,613 --> 00:57:38,193
Yeah, exactly.

1194
00:57:38,634 --> 00:57:39,795
Like all the kind of standard techniques.

1195
00:57:39,815 --> 00:57:40,495
There's nothing really,

1196
00:57:40,515 --> 00:57:43,077
we don't have any particularly secret result,

1197
00:57:43,097 --> 00:57:44,959
it's just the same stuff that everyone else is doing.

1198
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:47,021
But for this, it was just artistic.

1199
00:57:48,616 --> 00:57:50,417
That was the point we made about all the manual labor

1200
00:57:52,098 --> 00:57:55,941
Just asking to myself because in previous companies I tried to

1201
00:57:56,502 --> 00:58:00,345
to make more photogrammetry with the artistic team and

1202
00:58:00,665 --> 00:58:03,067
The the main problems was on the quality

1203
00:58:04,528 --> 00:58:11,390
it was too good and the artists feel bad with this technique.

1204
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:13,730
They don't feel artists anymore.

1205
00:58:14,511 --> 00:58:19,052
And even if the result is very great,

1206
00:58:19,632 --> 00:58:27,615
how do you get all your team adopt this and feel artists with this technique?

1207
00:58:28,478 --> 00:58:31,100
So basically, as I mentioned,

1208
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,721
like the artists who capture the asset,

1209
00:58:32,761 --> 00:58:35,343
they go through the entire pipeline of capturing,

1210
00:58:35,783 --> 00:58:38,245
building assets, building the levels, polishing the levels,

1211
00:58:38,305 --> 00:58:39,666
the entire thing, so they're responsible

1212
00:58:39,746 --> 00:58:41,688
for the entire big picture.

1213
00:58:41,748 --> 00:58:43,909
And that's, I think, the point that brings in the creativity

1214
00:58:43,969 --> 00:58:45,851
of building a very complete big picture.

1215
00:58:46,311 --> 00:58:47,732
If they were just building a single asset

1216
00:58:47,752 --> 00:58:49,473
and then handing it off and not, you know,

1217
00:58:49,493 --> 00:58:50,934
forgetting about it, that's not creative at all.

1218
00:58:51,415 --> 00:58:52,976
But if they're working on photographic assets

1219
00:58:52,996 --> 00:58:56,458
within a big picture, that's, at least for me, very creative.

1220
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,200
And it speaks a little bit to that slide that I had

1221
00:58:59,261 --> 00:59:02,302
about having people who do enjoy working that way,

1222
00:59:02,322 --> 00:59:03,482
who do adopt the technique,

1223
00:59:03,922 --> 00:59:05,843
and can do great results with it to lead.

1224
00:59:05,983 --> 00:59:07,543
But you're gonna have people that don't,

1225
00:59:07,683 --> 00:59:10,364
that hate it and leave, or that just refuse to do it.

1226
00:59:11,225 --> 00:59:12,485
There's not a lot you can do about it,

1227
00:59:12,885 --> 00:59:15,066
but I mean, that's always the case, I guess.

1228
00:59:15,086 --> 00:59:17,227
Thank you very much.

1229
00:59:17,247 --> 00:59:19,327
Thanks.

1230
00:59:19,807 --> 00:59:20,888
Thank you for the presentation.

1231
00:59:21,468 --> 00:59:23,129
I apologize because I got here a little late,

1232
00:59:23,169 --> 00:59:24,569
so sorry if this is a repeat question.

1233
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,142
were the best kind of camera to use

1234
00:59:29,362 --> 00:59:31,504
and what was the best photography format you found?

1235
00:59:31,785 --> 00:59:33,586
Yeah, so we went through a bit of iteration on there,

1236
00:59:33,626 --> 00:59:36,609
but we ended up with a Canon 6D

1237
00:59:36,649 --> 00:59:37,770
with a 24 millimeter lens.

1238
00:59:38,811 --> 00:59:39,352
And we shoot RAW.

1239
00:59:39,912 --> 00:59:40,653
We shoot RAW, of course.

1240
00:59:41,574 --> 00:59:42,114
Good choices.

1241
00:59:44,884 --> 00:59:46,265
Hi guys, so...

1242
00:59:46,285 --> 00:59:47,786
I'm sorry, this is kind of long.

1243
00:59:48,486 --> 00:59:52,108
So, I don't know if you mentioned this during the presentation,

1244
00:59:52,448 --> 00:59:56,890
but I was just wondering what's your workflow from getting a tileable texture

1245
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:01,193
from a terrain in Photoshop?

1246
01:00:01,733 --> 01:00:04,815
So, the thing about the terrain textures, they were...

1247
01:00:06,057 --> 01:00:08,099
capturing just one element at a time,

1248
01:00:08,119 --> 01:00:10,901
so almost tiling naturally in the real world.

1249
01:00:11,801 --> 01:00:13,183
And again, no trickery there,

1250
01:00:13,203 --> 01:00:15,264
it was just the regular Photoshop offset

1251
01:00:15,484 --> 01:00:16,725
or whatever you want to do.

1252
01:00:17,065 --> 01:00:17,486
No tricks.

1253
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:22,870
Excellent presentation, thank you very much.

1254
01:00:25,052 --> 01:00:28,414
How did you source the terrain data for the Endor,

1255
01:00:28,815 --> 01:00:31,196
the highly dense forest areas,

1256
01:00:31,637 --> 01:00:33,798
including the river, and how did you do the river in there?

1257
01:00:35,126 --> 01:00:39,568
So we tried to, well we did capture the real locations,

1258
01:00:39,648 --> 01:00:41,689
and the LiDAR was also from the real locations.

1259
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:43,950
With the opentopography.org,

1260
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:45,871
that's mostly based within the US,

1261
01:00:46,631 --> 01:00:50,813
so we had the location where they actually filmed the movie.

1262
01:00:51,834 --> 01:00:52,794
It wasn't as high quality,

1263
01:00:52,834 --> 01:00:55,055
but it didn't need to be as high quality for Endor,

1264
01:00:55,095 --> 01:00:56,876
because it was covered with all the junk on top.

1265
01:00:57,897 --> 01:00:59,817
So that worked well for that.

1266
01:01:00,978 --> 01:01:03,219
Death Valley was where they shot a lot of the,

1267
01:01:03,978 --> 01:01:06,686
clips from when you hope so that's where we captured that one from and got the

1268
01:01:06,706 --> 01:01:09,374
LIDAR for as well so it's also from the real real places

1269
01:01:13,069 --> 01:01:17,851
Hi, with the 3D scanning, I know you've used Agisoft,

1270
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:18,651
is what you were saying.

1271
01:01:18,691 --> 01:01:20,972
Would you rather be going towards some other direction,

1272
01:01:20,992 --> 01:01:22,452
or are you looking at some other options

1273
01:01:22,492 --> 01:01:23,293
for future projects?

1274
01:01:23,693 --> 01:01:26,414
I mean, it's what we use at the moment.

1275
01:01:26,574 --> 01:01:27,534
There's definitely other options.

1276
01:01:27,634 --> 01:01:29,435
I mean, definitely be open to other options as well.

1277
01:01:29,475 --> 01:01:30,916
We're always looking into new software

1278
01:01:30,936 --> 01:01:33,556
that comes up like RealityCatcher and things like that.

1279
01:01:34,117 --> 01:01:36,638
So we're definitely not stuck within that line.

1280
01:01:36,878 --> 01:01:39,899
We've even talked about doing our own photogrammetry solver

1281
01:01:39,939 --> 01:01:41,859
within the company itself, so that we have

1282
01:01:41,899 --> 01:01:42,500
full control of it.

1283
01:01:43,085 --> 01:01:43,265
Right.

1284
01:01:44,985 --> 01:01:45,425
Hi, guys.

1285
01:01:45,565 --> 01:01:46,126
Nice work.

1286
01:01:46,386 --> 01:01:51,467
So my first question is, how you do to capture sequoia

1287
01:01:51,507 --> 01:01:53,988
with only 24 millimeter lens?

1288
01:01:54,988 --> 01:01:56,628
Because it's really, really high.

1289
01:01:57,229 --> 01:02:01,730
And how you can have so many details in the hay?

1290
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:04,631
So the trees were captured.

1291
01:02:04,651 --> 01:02:06,211
I mean, they're absolutely huge, those trees,

1292
01:02:06,311 --> 01:02:07,632
like four meters across.

1293
01:02:07,812 --> 01:02:09,912
So we captured maybe about 10 meters.
