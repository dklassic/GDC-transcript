1
00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:12,300
Welcome to GDC 2018, this is three steps to becoming a better artist, immediately.

2
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,763
I'm not, that's not my style.

3
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,842
All right, so I was listening to NPR a few weeks ago

4
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,764
because I wanted you guys to think I was smart.

5
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:32,047
And I caught this awesome story about,

6
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:34,670
this is called The Flying Fortress.

7
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,371
It's an airplane that Boeing premiered in the 1930s.

8
00:00:39,726 --> 00:00:44,230
showed it off at the first air show, it ended in tragedy.

9
00:00:44,951 --> 00:00:47,573
And it wasn't that the super skilled pilots

10
00:00:47,613 --> 00:00:49,835
couldn't do some back flip barrel roll maneuver,

11
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:51,397
it was actually something very simple.

12
00:00:51,717 --> 00:00:54,200
They didn't check the landing gear properly.

13
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,803
And from there spawned this idea of checklists.

14
00:00:57,883 --> 00:01:00,245
So every pilot on every plane that you guys

15
00:01:00,265 --> 00:01:03,769
flew here today on, they have a basic ass checklist of like.

16
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:09,062
landing gear and close the doors and super, super basic stuff like all the

17
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:12,385
hotshot pilots, you know, when they're in the zone, they can forget they're human.

18
00:01:12,445 --> 00:01:13,446
They can forget basic things.

19
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,709
So a checklist actually can help prevent disaster.

20
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:21,653
And that checklist idea actually transferred over to medicine and, and, you

21
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:25,516
know, geniuses of medicine, surgeons, all that stuff, they were making very easy

22
00:01:25,556 --> 00:01:28,319
mistakes and causing infections by not doing things in the right order,

23
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:30,080
overlooking a step here or there.

24
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:31,742
So again, this idea of.

25
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,622
Very simple and basic checklist.

26
00:01:34,722 --> 00:01:36,303
Wash your hands, then put on your gloves,

27
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,365
then do the tube thingy, then take the plastic off.

28
00:01:38,705 --> 00:01:42,849
Like, that basic checklist is what's saving lives today.

29
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,952
So my name's Horia Dociu, that's how you pronounce it.

30
00:01:47,112 --> 00:01:49,174
Horia, it's Romanian.

31
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:52,256
And, um.

32
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:55,769
I'm currently the studio art director at ArenaNet.

33
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,271
If you're not familiar with ArenaNet,

34
00:01:57,871 --> 00:01:59,553
we're up in Seattle, Washington.

35
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:01,154
We're about 400 people strong.

36
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,678
Lovely, awesome, frickin' amazing place to work for.

37
00:02:05,699 --> 00:02:06,920
Been there about a decade.

38
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:11,064
And yeah, we're known for Guild Wars,

39
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:14,187
which is a MMO.

40
00:02:15,068 --> 00:02:16,089
That's a free, it's free.

41
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:17,410
You don't even have to pay for it.

42
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:20,838
All right, but I've done other stuff in my 18 years

43
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:22,760
of industry experience.

44
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,564
I was an animation studio, animation student at DigiPen.

45
00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:29,866
I did props for Half-Life 2.

46
00:02:30,807 --> 00:02:32,288
I taught concept art at Future Poly,

47
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:36,011
and I was an art director on Second Son for Sucker Punch.

48
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:37,873
Here's some of my personal work,

49
00:02:37,893 --> 00:02:39,094
just to get to know me a little bit.

50
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:43,577
Some concept art, some freelance stuff,

51
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:46,700
some of my art for Second Son.

52
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:51,029
Some old Guild Wars concept art.

53
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,331
And then here's a couple week old life drawing sketch

54
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:57,852
from the figure drawing sessions that we have every Thursday

55
00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:58,912
at ArenaNet.

56
00:02:58,932 --> 00:03:00,773
There's a couple hours we block out just to draw.

57
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,533
And the reason I put these in here

58
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:05,034
is because I want to show off.

59
00:03:05,354 --> 00:03:05,854
No, just kidding.

60
00:03:06,455 --> 00:03:07,775
It's actually, I'm going to look rather bad when

61
00:03:07,815 --> 00:03:09,255
I flip to the next slide, because I

62
00:03:09,296 --> 00:03:10,816
want to talk about the guy who runs the class.

63
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:14,117
His name's Aaron Coberly, and he's like an art genius.

64
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:17,398
He's been the character lead at ArenaNet for about 14 years.

65
00:03:18,292 --> 00:03:19,392
And I've known him long before that.

66
00:03:19,452 --> 00:03:22,573
I attended his life drawing classes way back in high school.

67
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:27,495
And this guy's obviously a super talent, right?

68
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:30,436
Like oil painting, watercolor, pencil.

69
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:31,956
These are 30-second gestures.

70
00:03:31,976 --> 00:03:32,796
Like, fuck you, Aaron.

71
00:03:32,856 --> 00:03:33,437
Like, that's insane.

72
00:03:33,477 --> 00:03:34,917
Thank you.

73
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:38,774
But here's the awesome thing about Aaron.

74
00:03:39,114 --> 00:03:41,515
He does this stuff three times a week, four hours at a time.

75
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:43,876
And look what's in his pocket.

76
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:45,796
It's a crusty little checklist.

77
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:47,237
And I just texted him.

78
00:03:47,257 --> 00:03:48,877
I was like, Aaron, send me a picture of your checklist,

79
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:49,918
because I know he's always got it.

80
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:52,219
So just like surgeons, just like fighter pilots,

81
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,640
this dude who does it nonstop, 24-7,

82
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,541
he keeps a checklist of like squint.

83
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:02,510
Okay, like, Squint is at the top of this dude's list.

84
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,752
So, you're not smarter than Fighter Pilot,

85
00:04:06,352 --> 00:04:09,995
so my spiel here is about three super easy steps

86
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:12,476
to hopefully make us all better artists.

87
00:04:13,757 --> 00:04:15,758
But, first I want to break down

88
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:17,380
how I think about visual design.

89
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,400
This is my personal take.

90
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:20,301
Might seem silly to some of you guys,

91
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:23,043
but I think it frames a little bit of the stuff I'm talking about.

92
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,525
So, I see these three pillars in my head.

93
00:04:26,105 --> 00:04:26,566
And the first is...

94
00:04:27,512 --> 00:04:28,352
what I call the idea.

95
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:30,114
It's the intellectual read, like what is it?

96
00:04:30,434 --> 00:04:32,456
This could actually be a paragraph for all I care.

97
00:04:32,496 --> 00:04:33,237
It's all typed up, right?

98
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:34,338
It's just the idea, what it is.

99
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:36,980
And it's the design, kind of like shape, language,

100
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,821
proportions, maybe the model.

101
00:04:40,403 --> 00:04:40,543
Right?

102
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,384
Even in the silhouette, you can tell who's a real human

103
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:43,545
and who's a cartoon right there.

104
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:45,447
And then the method of rendering.

105
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:49,270
Is it oil paint or is it photo real PBR in-game?

106
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,051
Is it cell shaded?

107
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:54,915
Is it whatever, just how is it rendered?

108
00:04:55,614 --> 00:04:57,876
And then all that stuff is kind of in service of tone.

109
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:02,019
Vibe, mood, things that enforce the themes.

110
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,401
So like lighting, color palettes, cinematography,

111
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:07,323
music would be a good candidate to go in here.

112
00:05:07,823 --> 00:05:10,365
So in one of many food analogies I have in here,

113
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:14,928
if art content is the food, then tone is the restaurant.

114
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:17,470
So like Mario Kart happens at Chuck E. Cheese,

115
00:05:18,171 --> 00:05:19,772
and Resident Evil happens at my house.

116
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,951
Stupid jokes.

117
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:30,232
So lastly is execution.

118
00:05:30,632 --> 00:05:32,592
And this just literally means how well did you,

119
00:05:33,052 --> 00:05:34,593
kind of the craftsmanship aspect,

120
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:37,534
how well did you execute on what you set out to do.

121
00:05:39,034 --> 00:05:41,135
All right, so to kind of explain this a little further,

122
00:05:41,595 --> 00:05:44,516
I'll just use a simple example.

123
00:05:44,716 --> 00:05:45,376
Homer Simpson.

124
00:05:46,076 --> 00:05:48,937
So the tone is a clever, crude comedy satire,

125
00:05:48,957 --> 00:05:49,357
The Simpsons.

126
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:54,827
The idea is a dumb fat American family man with anger issues.

127
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:57,548
The design is cartoonish round shapes,

128
00:05:57,608 --> 00:05:58,928
and the technique is cel-shaded.

129
00:05:58,948 --> 00:06:00,649
And of course, he looks like that.

130
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:03,690
So in my head, what if you changed the technique

131
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,070
to be 3D clay?

132
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,230
Looks like that.

133
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,131
If you change it to be photorealistic,

134
00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:11,452
oh, what, gross, gross!

135
00:06:12,312 --> 00:06:14,272
Now, you're saying, why didn't that look like a real person?

136
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:16,433
Because in my head, you gotta change the design

137
00:06:16,533 --> 00:06:18,113
to be real human proportions,

138
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,174
and then it might look like that.

139
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:20,734
Ha-ha.

140
00:06:21,835 --> 00:06:24,495
And then if we talk about the tone,

141
00:06:26,376 --> 00:06:27,996
it goes from kind of a crude comedy

142
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:30,377
to maybe like a dark comedy, like a Tim Burton thing,

143
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:31,397
and look like that.

144
00:06:33,198 --> 00:06:36,839
All right, so different tone, different technique,

145
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:43,361
different design, different tone.

146
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:44,061
Oh, what?

147
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:44,621
Did I mess it up?

148
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,604
Different idea, different technique, different design,

149
00:06:50,045 --> 00:06:52,147
different tone, different execution.

150
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,131
You guys remember that?

151
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:55,972
That is tragic.

152
00:06:58,034 --> 00:07:00,497
So idea, tone, design, technique, execution, these

153
00:07:00,517 --> 00:07:03,160
are tools for expression.

154
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:07,435
And what's unfortunate is I think this is where the magic happens.

155
00:07:07,455 --> 00:07:09,496
Like, what are you saying?

156
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:10,256
What are you making?

157
00:07:10,276 --> 00:07:10,957
What are you building?

158
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:13,578
That's where that happens in those two columns.

159
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,059
But everybody, including myself, kind of focuses on this other stuff, right?

160
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:19,420
You go to Art Station, go, oh, it's gorgeous looking.

161
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,041
And so you don't have to raise your hands, but in like your brain, raise your hand.

162
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:26,082
These are quotes that I've had in my life that I'm not terribly proud of.

163
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:27,783
But let's see if you guys agree.

164
00:07:27,983 --> 00:07:30,104
Like, oh, I want to draw like Ashley Wood.

165
00:07:30,124 --> 00:07:31,644
That's not anything.

166
00:07:31,664 --> 00:07:32,445
You don't start like that.

167
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:38,521
I'm going to make a portfolio piece tonight. What are you drawing? What do you want for little piece, right?

168
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:44,724
I need to get started freaking ASAP. I can't think about this. I got to go. I got to go and what's my style

169
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:45,604
What's my style?

170
00:07:46,405 --> 00:07:46,745
like I

171
00:07:47,905 --> 00:07:51,047
don't lie to me all of you guys have thought some of that crap and

172
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:57,010
You know what's my style. Well. This is my dad, and he's got a cool saying about style fuck style

173
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:00,971
Expression is the ultimate goal

174
00:08:02,505 --> 00:08:03,065
Cool, Hoya.

175
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:05,367
Why is your dad talking to you about art?

176
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:07,670
Well, because he was my boss for 10 years at ArenaNet.

177
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,934
He's this phenomenal concept artist, designer,

178
00:08:12,714 --> 00:08:13,555
and art director.

179
00:08:14,356 --> 00:08:15,557
And I took his job.

180
00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:16,518
He left.

181
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:17,018
He left.

182
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,079
But I did.

183
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:18,420
I did.

184
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,921
Come on.

185
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:21,803
I'm not going to take his job.

186
00:08:23,224 --> 00:08:24,886
No, but he taught me that expression truly

187
00:08:24,986 --> 00:08:26,788
is the most important thing.

188
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:31,966
I got to work with a ton of other awesome people at ArenaNet.

189
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:37,570
Tao Prince, Carlin Lim, Amber Barrett, Levi Hopkins,

190
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:43,314
Richard Anderson, Keikaku Taki, Jamie Jones, Thomas Scholes,

191
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:45,715
Neil Hansen, Jason Stokes.

192
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:47,276
These are just some of the people that taught me

193
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:48,878
expression is the ultimate goal.

194
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:50,459
They didn't all sit down and tell me.

195
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:52,240
They didn't all say fuck.

196
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,103
But just by seeing them in action and the way they interact with people

197
00:08:56,123 --> 00:08:57,183
and the way that they think.

198
00:08:58,264 --> 00:08:58,884
I buy into this.

199
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:00,825
Oh yeah, who cares about expression?

200
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:03,246
Why, why should I care about expression?

201
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:05,007
We're commercial artists, this is our job,

202
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:06,287
like scoot the toilet over.

203
00:09:06,768 --> 00:09:08,168
This is our job, who cares?

204
00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:10,369
Well, I don't think you guys would be in this room

205
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:11,990
if you weren't actually artists.

206
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,031
Like, the commercial part is to pay the bills

207
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:17,012
and whatever, eat food, but we're all artists,

208
00:09:17,032 --> 00:09:18,993
so that's who I'm talking to today is the artist.

209
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:20,594
So here it is, three steps to becoming

210
00:09:20,634 --> 00:09:22,395
a better artist immediately.

211
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:25,416
I'm not gonna lose that lens flare, it's hot.

212
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:27,229
It makes it pop.

213
00:09:27,869 --> 00:09:28,109
All right.

214
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,390
So checklist.

215
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:29,971
This is it.

216
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:32,793
Get your e-pencils ready or whatever.

217
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,334
I'm just joking.

218
00:09:35,674 --> 00:09:35,874
All right.

219
00:09:35,915 --> 00:09:39,337
So the first one is about just being groovy and cool,

220
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:42,659
nice people, which I'm sure like 90% of you are.

221
00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:44,540
85% of you are.

222
00:09:45,701 --> 00:09:48,783
It's about being open minded, taking direction well,

223
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:49,703
being friendly.

224
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:53,246
That's sort of important stuff in this very collaborative

225
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:54,587
endeavor we call making games.

226
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:57,289
I couldn't get that in a short enough thing,

227
00:09:57,329 --> 00:09:58,710
so I just said, don't be a dick.

228
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:00,472
That's my number one.

229
00:10:00,812 --> 00:10:02,814
It's not terribly connected to the next two,

230
00:10:03,274 --> 00:10:06,356
but time and time again, since I was, whatever,

231
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:08,818
first starting out in the industry till right now,

232
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:09,639
till when I was a teacher,

233
00:10:09,939 --> 00:10:11,861
like this is the number one thing I cannot stress enough.

234
00:10:12,021 --> 00:10:14,063
It's foundational.

235
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:17,208
All right, number two, stop and think, please.

236
00:10:17,248 --> 00:10:17,748
What are you doing?

237
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:18,769
What are you doing?

238
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:19,349
What are you saying?

239
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:23,190
Just stop, take some time, and think before you act.

240
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:27,032
Because I think it's so stressful

241
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:28,172
to have that empty piece of paper.

242
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,253
You've got to go get stuff on there.

243
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:31,074
Like, just take a moment.

244
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:31,574
Take a moment.

245
00:10:31,994 --> 00:10:33,374
And lastly, use reference.

246
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:36,015
Pretty self-explanatory, but I think every great artist

247
00:10:37,576 --> 00:10:40,157
knows that this is the difference between professionals

248
00:10:40,277 --> 00:10:41,037
and amateurs.

249
00:10:41,398 --> 00:10:41,918
All right, number one.

250
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,662
So at ArenaNet, we actually have a no-jerk policy.

251
00:10:45,782 --> 00:10:49,283
I've seen them send people home mid-interview,

252
00:10:49,443 --> 00:10:51,124
like, you could be the most talented person,

253
00:10:51,144 --> 00:10:53,025
but if you've got that rock star attitude,

254
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:55,286
where you do the best, get out.

255
00:10:55,386 --> 00:10:58,587
There's the door, because the whole point of games

256
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:01,169
is that it's a collaborative environment.

257
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:03,550
These are a couple of creative geniuses here.

258
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,731
John Cleese talks about creativity.

259
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:08,472
being kind of a willingness to play.

260
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:10,873
You can't play when people are being assholes next door.

261
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:13,395
You can't play around when people are stressing you out

262
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:14,516
or saying no all the time.

263
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:16,177
You know, you have, even when you're by yourself,

264
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:17,738
you have to kind of give yourself that space

265
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:19,779
and that time for your mind to wander

266
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:21,480
and be creative and be in that open state.

267
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:24,942
And you know, if you're leads in here,

268
00:11:25,822 --> 00:11:27,764
be Jim Henson, say thank you to all your artists.

269
00:11:27,784 --> 00:11:29,465
Like just make it a cool place to be,

270
00:11:29,845 --> 00:11:32,206
to work kind of that, like groovy.

271
00:11:32,286 --> 00:11:33,427
I know that sounds silly,

272
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:35,368
but like we all need that to be successful.

273
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:35,548
So.

274
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:36,922
Don't be a dick.

275
00:11:38,543 --> 00:11:40,764
I tried to put it in a cool sports analogy

276
00:11:41,104 --> 00:11:41,925
to impress you guys.

277
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:45,166
But then I got distracted by this dude because he looks.

278
00:11:45,547 --> 00:11:46,087
No, hold on.

279
00:11:46,847 --> 00:11:49,369
He looks like a perfect mix of John Lithgow and my buddy

280
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,289
Daniel, right?

281
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,671
So I had to change the poster.

282
00:11:57,245 --> 00:12:02,447
I changed it to this a creature is a feature and that's like a very cool rhyming thing that I made up

283
00:12:02,827 --> 00:12:06,248
But what I mean by that is of course when you're making a creature in the game

284
00:12:06,288 --> 00:12:11,550
You're not just making something Z brush and chucking it in that's nothing. That's a mesh. That's bullshit creature is

285
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:24,642
There's a backstory, and like how does it move, where does it live, what sounds does it make, what's the game design, what's the AI, what effects come off of it when it shoots its laser beams, like all of that stuff, that's the creature, that's what the player interacts with, that's your art form.

286
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:27,786
And so if you ever think you're making something on your own, you're not.

287
00:12:28,346 --> 00:12:29,848
A creature's a feature, we're working together.

288
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:35,314
The best work that I've ever done and the most enjoyable and satisfying was when...

289
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:41,939
I was working in strike teams where you show up to the table and there's somebody from animation and art and design and

290
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:48,724
Literally every one of every department that's going to touch this thing you're like all right by next Friday

291
00:12:48,764 --> 00:12:53,448
We got to make this thing fun. Whether it's this and second son this

292
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:58,812
R1 laser shot needs to be way more impactful and fun or or this creature needs to be more badass or whatever like

293
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:03,075
we got to take all these things into consideration and put them all into the

294
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:03,435
creature.

295
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:07,556
And you can't be at that table unless there's trust, respect,

296
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:11,998
and honest collaboration. And by trust, I mean, of course,

297
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,699
that you have to kind of

298
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:19,413
Trust people that you can give them feedback across disciplines, all that stuff.

299
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:20,213
It's safe.

300
00:13:21,173 --> 00:13:22,813
You respect them to do their jobs, though.

301
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,034
You don't try to, like, I'm not going to go tell the sound guy.

302
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:26,734
I'll tell him, yeah, I think it's just bleh.

303
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:27,835
But I need to do my job.

304
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,655
I need to draw it as good as possible to make sure he knows what it sounds like.

305
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:32,476
And I could say this sounds good, this sounds bad.

306
00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:34,616
But at the end of the day, we're all sharing it.

307
00:13:34,776 --> 00:13:35,716
It's our creature.

308
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:37,937
And I got to respect that he's going to do the right thing.

309
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:39,837
And that is what true collaboration is.

310
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:41,298
So again, just don't be a dick.

311
00:13:42,098 --> 00:13:43,799
And if you're starting out in the industry

312
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:46,300
or you got junior gremlins on your team,

313
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:50,323
everybody knows the first six months of being in the industry,

314
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,884
you learn more than four years of school.

315
00:13:54,505 --> 00:13:56,827
My mother-in-law says, you got two eyes and two ears,

316
00:13:56,927 --> 00:13:57,607
only one mouth.

317
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:02,970
And she's right, you gotta be this when you're starting out in the industry or any time.

318
00:14:03,091 --> 00:14:05,893
Like listen, collaborate, just be like this.

319
00:14:06,073 --> 00:14:10,217
I don't know what this reference is, I hope it's not some weird puppet, weird porno or

320
00:14:10,238 --> 00:14:10,778
something, sorry.

321
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,283
Anyway, but if you're cool and you take critique well and all that stuff, you get chosen for

322
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:19,627
better projects, better teams, and then pretty soon you end up on people's...

323
00:14:20,547 --> 00:14:21,728
superhero list.

324
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:23,529
We all have this list, like right now,

325
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:24,850
if I was like, you get a billion dollars

326
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,971
and you can start a game company,

327
00:14:26,051 --> 00:14:28,293
like you're like, I would hire Jason and so on, so on, so on.

328
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,874
Like, you know exactly who you'd hire,

329
00:14:29,894 --> 00:14:31,675
and the only way you end up on that list

330
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:33,416
is not just to be super talented,

331
00:14:33,496 --> 00:14:35,017
it's to be awesome to work with.

332
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:36,758
So, start making your list.

333
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,802
All right, so, you learn more by being cool,

334
00:14:43,322 --> 00:14:45,544
you do better work collaborating, and you get more jobs.

335
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:47,085
All right, number one is done.

336
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:48,406
I beat that horse to death.

337
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:49,226
Number two.

338
00:14:50,319 --> 00:14:51,983
Stop and think, all right?

339
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:54,228
Art is visual communication.

340
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:55,391
Here's a sweet example.

341
00:14:58,181 --> 00:14:59,142
I can't take credit for that.

342
00:14:59,222 --> 00:14:59,882
I didn't make that up.

343
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,022
I'm not that smart.

344
00:15:01,563 --> 00:15:02,283
I thought it was hilarious.

345
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:04,764
But I was just searching for pie charts because it's like,

346
00:15:04,784 --> 00:15:08,126
a pie chart is this two-second piece of information

347
00:15:08,486 --> 00:15:10,387
that actually stands for a whole ton.

348
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:12,108
It's like a wall of nonsense text

349
00:15:12,548 --> 00:15:14,709
that's told through a cool pie chart.

350
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,951
Visual communication is just amazing.

351
00:15:18,311 --> 00:15:19,852
It transcends time.

352
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,113
Like, what's that?

353
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,273
A cow.

354
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:23,154
What's that?

355
00:15:23,174 --> 00:15:24,054
A horse.

356
00:15:24,354 --> 00:15:24,654
Cool.

357
00:15:24,694 --> 00:15:25,755
You know who got us to say that?

358
00:15:26,575 --> 00:15:27,376
Together, we all said it.

359
00:15:27,456 --> 00:15:28,897
It probably didn't show up on film,

360
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:30,137
but everybody was saying cow and horse.

361
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:32,739
This was awesome.

362
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:33,599
I got goose bumps.

363
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,320
That was drawn like 17,000 years ago.

364
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:36,881
Are you kidding me?

365
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:38,822
Like, you don't have to speak cave mayonnaise.

366
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:40,102
You just know what that is.

367
00:15:40,663 --> 00:15:42,003
Visual communication, amazing.

368
00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:44,745
And international crew here, right?

369
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,426
No matter where you live on Earth, you know what this is.

370
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:48,507
One, two, three.

371
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:49,967
Stop.

372
00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:50,468
All right.

373
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:51,648
I'm going to add two more things.

374
00:15:51,668 --> 00:15:52,749
You guys tell me when you're ready.

375
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:52,849
Stop.

376
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:56,834
It's that famous MC Hammer song.

377
00:15:58,496 --> 00:15:58,957
Hilarious.

378
00:15:58,977 --> 00:15:59,558
All right.

379
00:15:59,938 --> 00:16:02,741
So the point is, we all agree it's visual communication,

380
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:02,961
right?

381
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,044
So for the point of this chat, I'm

382
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:07,106
going to just say it's straight up communication.

383
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:15,476
And first thing, when you come up to the podium, like, what?

384
00:16:16,432 --> 00:16:17,712
That's not how you start.

385
00:16:17,772 --> 00:16:18,753
Like, whoa.

386
00:16:19,173 --> 00:16:21,033
I mean, even I'm from Romania, when people are like,

387
00:16:21,073 --> 00:16:21,934
oh, say something in Romanian.

388
00:16:22,034 --> 00:16:23,895
I can't think of anything to say.

389
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:25,155
I'm a grown ass man.

390
00:16:25,175 --> 00:16:26,416
I can't think of a sentence.

391
00:16:26,516 --> 00:16:28,697
Because what are you thinking?

392
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,398
Saying something in a British accent is stupid.

393
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:33,479
Forget style for style's sake.

394
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:35,759
And start focusing on, why am I doing this?

395
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,060
What do I want to say?

396
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,080
Who am I saying it to?

397
00:16:40,054 --> 00:16:42,795
And really, importantly, for expression,

398
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:44,977
how can I be most expressive to reach them best?

399
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,378
These are your tools right here.

400
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:47,598
So think about that stuff.

401
00:16:47,778 --> 00:16:48,579
Stop and think.

402
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,521
So in game design terms, that means

403
00:16:51,901 --> 00:16:53,142
fill in your own design spec.

404
00:16:53,922 --> 00:16:57,004
Obviously, if somebody sat there and typed up

405
00:16:57,044 --> 00:16:59,646
all the details for you, your job's done.

406
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,207
Make sure you check all the boxes.

407
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,068
But if you're doing something.

408
00:17:04,452 --> 00:17:04,972
Like a barrel.

409
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:06,953
Maybe somebody didn't give you a bunch of info.

410
00:17:06,973 --> 00:17:08,074
They're like, make a fucking barrel.

411
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:08,814
Okay.

412
00:17:09,234 --> 00:17:10,355
So I'll go around to the artist.

413
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:11,836
I'll do my rounds and be like, what are you working on?

414
00:17:12,056 --> 00:17:12,476
A barrel.

415
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:14,617
Come on, man, I need more information.

416
00:17:16,438 --> 00:17:17,959
Friday, it's gonna be Duke's Duke Friday.

417
00:17:17,979 --> 00:17:21,841
It's like, that's not, like, no, I want adjectives.

418
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,482
Awesome, descriptive adjectives.

419
00:17:24,563 --> 00:17:25,103
Where's it go?

420
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:25,623
Who used it?

421
00:17:25,663 --> 00:17:26,003
Who made it?

422
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:26,504
All that stuff.

423
00:17:27,164 --> 00:17:30,466
And I didn't write this down, but I hate the word generic.

424
00:17:30,506 --> 00:17:31,766
Oh, it's just a generic barrel.

425
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,170
Get out, get out.

426
00:17:34,831 --> 00:17:35,732
Like there's no such thing.

427
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:38,193
Even like this is the most generic barrels I could find.

428
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:39,534
Wood barrel, right?

429
00:17:39,895 --> 00:17:41,116
All of them have a story to tell.

430
00:17:41,216 --> 00:17:43,137
Like what environment was it in?

431
00:17:43,277 --> 00:17:44,298
How long, how weathered?

432
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:45,279
Who made it?

433
00:17:45,379 --> 00:17:47,000
What's the technology of the people making it?

434
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,941
Like the different, you know, the wrapping,

435
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,482
what is that bamboo or something?

436
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:52,564
The one on the left like speaks to the things

437
00:17:52,584 --> 00:17:53,545
that the people have around them.

438
00:17:53,585 --> 00:17:55,886
It like ties it to the time and place where it's at.

439
00:17:55,946 --> 00:17:57,908
Like which one of these explodes?

440
00:17:59,309 --> 00:17:59,489
Right?

441
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:01,550
Like, barrels are like snowflakes.

442
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:03,031
They're like fingerprints.

443
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:06,113
There's a huge delta between what a barrel can mean.

444
00:18:06,133 --> 00:18:07,754
It's a do your fucking homework.

445
00:18:08,494 --> 00:18:10,736
My point is, anything can have character.

446
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:11,276
Anything.

447
00:18:11,956 --> 00:18:12,877
There's no small assignment.

448
00:18:12,997 --> 00:18:17,199
So a way to kind of depict that is pretty simple here.

449
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:19,781
The Harry Potter, what's this?

450
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:20,241
Gryffindor.

451
00:18:20,301 --> 00:18:21,442
Gryffindor common room.

452
00:18:21,782 --> 00:18:23,943
Like, it's inviting and warm and friendly,

453
00:18:24,183 --> 00:18:25,164
just like these blokes.

454
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:25,884
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

455
00:18:26,164 --> 00:18:26,604
Look at them.

456
00:18:26,885 --> 00:18:27,845
You want to be a Gryffindor?

457
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,641
Where do these assholes live?

458
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:32,022
Look at them.

459
00:18:32,883 --> 00:18:33,824
Of course they live here.

460
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:37,549
Like this place is better than you, it's expensive,

461
00:18:37,569 --> 00:18:39,871
but it's like off-putting, it's not inviting, it's cold.

462
00:18:41,193 --> 00:18:44,496
So just the way a set designer puts

463
00:18:45,097 --> 00:18:47,480
different pieces of furniture into a set to bring out a mood,

464
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:49,021
you can do that.

465
00:18:51,442 --> 00:18:54,965
So I think of anything, if it's a barrel, a creature, whatever, I think of it as a potsticker

466
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:56,066
because I'm kind of fat.

467
00:18:56,567 --> 00:19:01,151
So what are all the yummy things that go into a potsticker to make it delicious?

468
00:19:01,311 --> 00:19:02,432
And then you shove those in.

469
00:19:02,912 --> 00:19:05,835
So if you're making a creature, I say, what are you saying?

470
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,395
What are you making?

471
00:19:06,716 --> 00:19:07,376
I'm making a creature.

472
00:19:07,736 --> 00:19:08,377
What kind of creature?

473
00:19:08,877 --> 00:19:10,459
Start filling your design document up.

474
00:19:11,139 --> 00:19:14,042
Of course, at work, a lot of that's taken care of in the strike team, but you know,

475
00:19:14,142 --> 00:19:14,803
in your personal art.

476
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,002
Are you working on a movie concept,

477
00:19:18,262 --> 00:19:19,223
or are you making a game?

478
00:19:19,263 --> 00:19:20,343
All that stuff makes a difference.

479
00:19:20,563 --> 00:19:22,624
So I pre-did this like a cooking show.

480
00:19:22,665 --> 00:19:23,305
I filled it out.

481
00:19:23,905 --> 00:19:25,006
I said, we're making a game.

482
00:19:25,646 --> 00:19:26,807
It's a first-person shooter.

483
00:19:26,827 --> 00:19:28,928
Is it fantasy, steampunk?

484
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:31,629
I went with sci-fi, anime, creature.

485
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:32,530
It's a monster.

486
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,231
And then, why would you think of all that stuff

487
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,392
even if you're just doing your own game?

488
00:19:36,732 --> 00:19:39,193
Because you're not going to have a monster in a sci-fi game

489
00:19:39,213 --> 00:19:40,134
that's a unicorn, right?

490
00:19:40,394 --> 00:19:41,554
And so you're like, oh, maybe it's

491
00:19:41,574 --> 00:19:42,915
a mutant or a robot or a beast.

492
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,016
OK, those are sci-fi things.

493
00:19:44,056 --> 00:19:46,897
I'm going to say robot, intelligent, and then, oh,

494
00:19:47,057 --> 00:19:47,837
back up to game.

495
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:48,958
How does it move?

496
00:19:49,338 --> 00:19:51,059
Is it like, oh, I'm trying to shoot it a bunch,

497
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:53,340
and one bullet kills it, but it moves so fast I can't hit it.

498
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,000
That's a ninja.

499
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,682
Or is it like, slow and steady, and I'm just

500
00:19:56,742 --> 00:19:58,943
emptying my clip into it, and it falls right at my feet?

501
00:20:00,003 --> 00:20:00,143
Oh.

502
00:20:00,744 --> 00:20:00,804
Oh.

503
00:20:01,464 --> 00:20:01,904
Oh.

504
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:04,265
I don't know why I did that.

505
00:20:04,285 --> 00:20:04,985
I just made a weird one.

506
00:20:05,145 --> 00:20:06,746
All right, so that's like a tank enemy.

507
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:07,747
It was getting too serious.

508
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:10,288
So all that info goes into your gyoza,

509
00:20:10,548 --> 00:20:13,069
goes in your potsticker, goes in your game design document.

510
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:16,250
And then you're not just making a creature,

511
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,350
I don't know, by Friday.

512
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,992
You're saying, I'm making an intelligent robot tank enemy

513
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:21,352
creature for a sci-fi shooter.

514
00:20:21,832 --> 00:20:23,693
And that could be a damn paragraph.

515
00:20:23,713 --> 00:20:24,774
We just don't have all day here.

516
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,815
But the whole point is stop and think about what you're doing

517
00:20:29,776 --> 00:20:30,636
so you know what you're doing.

518
00:20:30,876 --> 00:20:32,577
That sounds obvious, but anyway.

519
00:20:33,157 --> 00:20:34,697
It's visual communication, so you

520
00:20:34,717 --> 00:20:36,198
have to know what to say before you say it.

521
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:41,379
Fill out your own design spec and use what, why, who, how,

522
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:41,799
all those.

523
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,720
That's your big tools right there.

524
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,981
And then the last one is use reference.

525
00:20:48,021 --> 00:20:49,122
If you're not familiar with that picture,

526
00:20:49,362 --> 00:20:51,122
it's of course from this famous scene in Titanic

527
00:20:51,142 --> 00:20:53,183
where he's referencing the life model.

528
00:20:53,403 --> 00:20:54,363
I have a scene right here.

529
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,446
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

530
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:03,930
I think the director drew that.

531
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:08,354
No, but we know that the traditional artists have always

532
00:21:08,414 --> 00:21:15,160
had live models and animation, whether it's just

533
00:21:15,261 --> 00:21:17,042
little facial expression stuff that they pick up

534
00:21:17,102 --> 00:21:20,305
for the little mermaid, or rotoscoping for Peter Pan,

535
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:23,649
or even the one-to-one expression capture

536
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:24,710
that they do for like, uh,

537
00:21:25,727 --> 00:21:27,588
the Gollum dude, what's an anti-circus, you know?

538
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:28,649
It's almost like one-to-one.

539
00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:31,110
You need reference.

540
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,170
Like, it just grounds things.

541
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,051
It brings life to them.

542
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:35,572
It makes them more believable and good.

543
00:21:35,952 --> 00:21:37,813
And it's not that reference is all about realism.

544
00:21:38,753 --> 00:21:40,274
This is an old episode I saw of the,

545
00:21:40,494 --> 00:21:43,256
I think it's on YouTube, Mickey Mouse show,

546
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,036
where they had, or what's it called, Mickey Mouse Club,

547
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:47,898
where they had these four awesome background painters

548
00:21:47,918 --> 00:21:49,499
go out and they painted a tree.

549
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:50,459
I'm like, that's how.

550
00:21:50,699 --> 00:21:53,221
real, but the guy in the middle is sort of cubistic.

551
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,222
This one on the right, guy went to town

552
00:21:55,262 --> 00:21:58,764
on the really groovy, awesome tree bark.

553
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:01,125
You had to be there and experience the tree

554
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:02,626
to get that crazy with the tree bark.

555
00:22:02,646 --> 00:22:04,588
He wouldn't have had that successful and expressive

556
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:07,089
piece if he wasn't live looking at the thing.

557
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:10,992
So just forget your needs, your corrections,

558
00:22:11,032 --> 00:22:13,053
and do a little internetting.

559
00:22:13,213 --> 00:22:15,114
We have supercomputers in our pockets.

560
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,975
There's no excuse to not do that.

561
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,061
And then there's like this little known artist I found on ArtStation.

562
00:22:24,142 --> 00:22:27,623
So look, there's no there's no arguing.

563
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:32,424
He's a master, master draftsman, painter, all that stuff.

564
00:22:32,444 --> 00:22:35,885
But I think his superpower comes in selecting the awesome models

565
00:22:35,925 --> 00:22:38,206
that have the most character and composing them

566
00:22:38,726 --> 00:22:40,727
in like the perfect kind of emotional shot.

567
00:22:40,807 --> 00:22:43,607
Like, sure, the painting brings it to a whole nother level.

568
00:22:43,807 --> 00:22:47,048
But like that photo, if you if you had photos like that on your Instagram.

569
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:50,074
his Instagram would be off the hook.

570
00:22:50,174 --> 00:22:53,099
So the way I think of it is creating art

571
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,782
is like arranging flowers.

572
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:56,705
So put yourself in that mind frame.

573
00:22:57,586 --> 00:22:58,488
All of these are beautiful.

574
00:22:58,648 --> 00:22:59,490
None of y'all could do this.

575
00:22:59,610 --> 00:22:59,990
I can't.

576
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,313
Like this is amazing.

577
00:23:02,317 --> 00:23:04,298
And nobody invented any of those flowers.

578
00:23:04,498 --> 00:23:05,978
Oh, it's from my own imagination.

579
00:23:05,998 --> 00:23:06,978
It's my own flower design.

580
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:07,878
Get out of here.

581
00:23:08,238 --> 00:23:10,039
It's just making the right selections

582
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:12,039
and putting them together in interesting ways.

583
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,360
And I bet you if I gave 10 pros the same flowers,

584
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,120
they'd each make a different arrangement out of it.

585
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,401
Like, quit thinking you're smarter than everybody.

586
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,581
Just look up some damn reference.

587
00:23:21,081 --> 00:23:22,501
And make a good reference.

588
00:23:23,221 --> 00:23:23,602
Tragic.

589
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:31,971
exotic, somber, not the first row in Google,

590
00:23:32,011 --> 00:23:33,892
not the first thing that pops up.

591
00:23:34,352 --> 00:23:36,673
Like shitty, generic, crappy reference

592
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:38,814
gets you your first apartment.

593
00:23:40,334 --> 00:23:43,295
And then like expressive, dynamic, interesting reference

594
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,456
gets you the Harry Potter common rooms.

595
00:23:46,876 --> 00:23:48,817
So expressive reference can say whatever

596
00:23:48,837 --> 00:23:49,777
you're trying to say for you.

597
00:23:49,797 --> 00:23:51,598
It's just about stopping, thinking,

598
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,638
and selecting the right stuff.

599
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:53,618
Or as a.

600
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:59,310
Peter Koenig shared a quote with me that he got from,

601
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,993
I don't know, it's like an old industry saying,

602
00:24:03,093 --> 00:24:05,995
and it's crude, but it makes a lot of sense.

603
00:24:06,355 --> 00:24:08,457
If you want good shit, eat good food.

604
00:24:08,477 --> 00:24:12,219
That'll stick in your brains there.

605
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:14,301
All right, so back to what we were.

606
00:24:15,347 --> 00:24:18,008
talking about we're talking about our creature so what are you what are you

607
00:24:18,028 --> 00:24:20,508
saying what are you making an intelligent robot tank enemy creature

608
00:24:20,568 --> 00:24:24,169
for a sci-fi shooter all right the whole point of that was to generate a list of

609
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:29,910
creatures that we could do a Google search for and remember I did this I did

610
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,871
it to make it stick in your minds we're drawing a tank guy that could take a lot

611
00:24:32,891 --> 00:24:38,532
of bullets no I didn't that guy can take the most bullets all right so

612
00:24:40,282 --> 00:24:41,042
Why not a rhino?

613
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:41,602
Well, hold on.

614
00:24:41,682 --> 00:24:43,263
You said intelligent robot creatures.

615
00:24:43,343 --> 00:24:45,603
So out of these guys, it's actually not the rhino.

616
00:24:45,623 --> 00:24:46,483
It's probably the gorilla.

617
00:24:46,523 --> 00:24:47,504
That's a better choice.

618
00:24:48,524 --> 00:24:51,084
So I take this gorilla, and I treat it sort of the armature,

619
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:52,825
maybe, for the monster.

620
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:56,665
And I say, I have a tank enemy sci-fi shooter robot gorilla

621
00:24:56,685 --> 00:24:57,025
thingy.

622
00:24:57,465 --> 00:24:58,986
And I shove those into the gyoza.

623
00:24:59,586 --> 00:25:02,586
And now it's time for reference dipping sauces.

624
00:25:03,247 --> 00:25:04,507
The dipping sauces.

625
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:06,987
I don't know why I'm doing that voice.

626
00:25:07,127 --> 00:25:07,507
There it is.

627
00:25:07,787 --> 00:25:09,868
So if we shove our.

628
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:15,013
thingy into kind of junkyard dipping sauce.

629
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:16,194
Bear with me.

630
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:18,996
Boom, you get an intelligent junkyard guard

631
00:25:19,116 --> 00:25:21,297
robot creature for sci-fi shooter, right?

632
00:25:21,557 --> 00:25:22,237
Like that makes sense.

633
00:25:23,678 --> 00:25:26,440
Or, if I go into the badass military sauce,

634
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,502
I chose mustard, because it's almost military colored.

635
00:25:29,582 --> 00:25:30,082
Pretty cool.

636
00:25:30,942 --> 00:25:31,443
Extra points.

637
00:25:32,183 --> 00:25:33,364
You get something that looks like this.

638
00:25:33,384 --> 00:25:35,165
An intelligent military assault bot

639
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,766
tank enemy for sci-fi shooter.

640
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:38,427
Either way, I mean, you saw it.

641
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:39,007
It was going.

642
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:42,075
Completely different ways, but the point

643
00:25:42,115 --> 00:25:44,296
is each one of those were super expressive,

644
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:47,638
had lots of information about them, had lots of character,

645
00:25:47,698 --> 00:25:48,979
and interesting references pulled.

646
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,942
Again, you've got to express yourself,

647
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,524
and you can just do it by curating expressive reference,

648
00:25:56,944 --> 00:25:58,685
and then just combining it in interesting ways.

649
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,787
There's no other super trick.

650
00:26:01,167 --> 00:26:02,468
So don't be a dick.

651
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:06,170
Stop and think, and use reference.

652
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,338
And I'll end with a couple slides left.

653
00:26:10,498 --> 00:26:12,699
So my friend Jamie Jones got this from a real painter

654
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:13,419
because he reads.

655
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:16,560
But anyway, there's this old saying

656
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,920
that if you have an hour to paint,

657
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,740
use the last 10 minutes to paint.

658
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,461
Use the 50 minutes to plan and think.

659
00:26:24,421 --> 00:26:25,481
That's pretty epic, pretty cool.

660
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,181
I think it was actually 45 minutes,

661
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:28,482
but this is the only clip art I found.

662
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:29,902
So 50 minutes.

663
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:32,783
The point is all the stuff, all the thought.

664
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,520
is going to help you express.

665
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:37,581
What are you trying to express?

666
00:26:38,142 --> 00:26:39,523
And all the things we talked about

667
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:40,544
are in that first column.

668
00:26:40,844 --> 00:26:43,786
The idea of what is it, what's the tone, what's the mood.

669
00:26:44,087 --> 00:26:47,069
And then all the other things can kind of service that.

670
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,492
So if you're doing something cartoony, you double down.

671
00:26:50,592 --> 00:26:53,114
Like those cute Yoshi games, now they're made out of wool.

672
00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:55,035
Oh, that's adorable, right?

673
00:26:55,476 --> 00:26:56,917
Like double down, double down.

674
00:26:57,057 --> 00:26:59,419
But again, if you don't have this first column taken care

675
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:01,320
of, if you don't stop and think about what you're doing

676
00:27:01,641 --> 00:27:03,802
and use really good reference, you're not going to be there.

677
00:27:04,543 --> 00:27:04,643
So.

678
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:09,167
If pilots can avoid disaster with a checklist of basics,

679
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:12,410
and surgeons have a super simple,

680
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,912
wash your hands kind of basic checklist to save lives,

681
00:27:15,873 --> 00:27:17,594
and Aaron's crusty ass piece of paper

682
00:27:17,694 --> 00:27:20,156
can help him make this fantastic, awesome art,

683
00:27:20,917 --> 00:27:24,000
then maybe, just maybe, you guys put this in your pocket,

684
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,882
and we all become better artists instantly.

685
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:28,103
Thank you very much.

686
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:40,108
I'm not sure if we have time for questions or...

687
00:27:40,128 --> 00:27:42,532
It's not rocket science, is it?

688
00:27:44,815 --> 00:27:45,075
Awesome.

689
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:46,437
No questions.

690
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,399
All right, thank you very much.

691
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:47,699
Thank you.
