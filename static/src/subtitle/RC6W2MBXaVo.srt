1
00:00:05,619 --> 00:00:06,439
I am Chris Tang.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,220
Where's my video?

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,080
Oh wait.

4
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:12,521
Oh, it's right here.

5
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:14,542
Okay, so

6
00:00:15,602 --> 00:00:17,503
I'm an indie game developer

7
00:00:17,863 --> 00:00:19,203
at Genasia Hitsparx Games.

8
00:00:19,863 --> 00:00:20,904
We kind of broke off from

9
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,384
Capcom and did production work for them

10
00:00:23,404 --> 00:00:25,825
a long time ago, but now we want to make our own IPs.

11
00:00:26,305 --> 00:00:27,486
I am the Senior Game Designer

12
00:00:27,606 --> 00:00:28,826
on Strike Blazinger,

13
00:00:29,526 --> 00:00:30,747
which is a high speed

14
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:34,824
High frame rate, spiritual successor to the arcade rail shooter, hopefully coming out

15
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:36,887
in the next year for PC, arcade, and console.

16
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:40,010
Anybody looking forward to that?

17
00:00:42,053 --> 00:00:42,774
Yay, thank you.

18
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:46,618
So I'm not a programmer by trade.

19
00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:50,443
This is the first game I've done all the gameplay code for so far, so I'm kind of proud of it.

20
00:00:56,542 --> 00:00:59,583
And also that was recently released was FX Yuki

21
00:00:59,623 --> 00:01:02,045
for the PC Engine TurboGrafx CD system.

22
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:05,387
And soon to be available on Sega Genesis,

23
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:06,767
Dreamcast and Windows PC.

24
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,689
I did some additional writing and design on that

25
00:01:09,889 --> 00:01:11,650
and they're kind of like our character crossover partner.

26
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,912
So the game that's, or the character that's

27
00:01:13,932 --> 00:01:15,993
the main character in our game is a secret character

28
00:01:16,013 --> 00:01:16,453
in their game.

29
00:01:18,894 --> 00:01:20,435
Going back further, I have past experience

30
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,576
working on many fighting games

31
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:23,837
with the Street Fighter franchise in particular for Capcom.

32
00:01:24,278 --> 00:01:26,018
as well as Primal Rage and Primal Rage 2,

33
00:01:26,578 --> 00:01:28,119
which was infamously canceled.

34
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:32,559
I did a session on Primal Rage 2 that I recommend.

35
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:33,880
People say it's pretty good.

36
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,280
So it was a GDC talk on games getting canceled

37
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:39,821
and how to live with it.

38
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:45,042
I started in the 90s working at Tengen and Atari,

39
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:46,142
working on stuff like that.

40
00:01:46,202 --> 00:01:48,402
I worked on Gauntlet 4 and Rampart and some other stuff.

41
00:01:49,183 --> 00:01:51,223
So yeah, I've been in the business a while,

42
00:01:51,263 --> 00:01:52,163
but I started when I was young,

43
00:01:52,203 --> 00:01:54,023
so I'm not as old as I seem.

44
00:01:55,344 --> 00:01:58,965
And in the mid 2000s, I worked at BPS, Blue Planet Software,

45
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:01,887
who is the official agent and custodian of the Tetris IP.

46
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:04,929
And I worked there as a design consultant at large

47
00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:06,689
and a designer on Tetris Worlds, which

48
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,011
was an early basis for the modern, more approachable

49
00:02:09,051 --> 00:02:10,411
versions of Tetris that you see today.

50
00:02:11,272 --> 00:02:13,573
And my favorite design contribution to Tetris back then

51
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:17,295
was this trailing shadow that I came up

52
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:18,676
with for the hard drop mechanic.

53
00:02:19,116 --> 00:02:21,057
And before this was put in, pieces would just teleport

54
00:02:21,097 --> 00:02:22,778
instantly to the bottom, and you couldn't really

55
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:23,798
tell what the hell was going on.

56
00:02:24,193 --> 00:02:26,414
So I thought it should have a translucent shadow

57
00:02:26,494 --> 00:02:30,135
to help you know what's going on visually.

58
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:31,716
It looks kind of cool, too.

59
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:34,917
So current games like Tetris Effect and Tetris 99

60
00:02:34,957 --> 00:02:35,877
have retained this feature.

61
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:37,378
So it makes me happy when I see it

62
00:02:37,418 --> 00:02:39,158
that developers are still using it,

63
00:02:39,478 --> 00:02:41,399
even though I didn't get to directly work on those games.

64
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,140
And aside from game development, I

65
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,821
have a background as a successful e-sports competitor,

66
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:49,802
best known for being the Sega World Champion,

67
00:02:50,182 --> 00:02:51,783
as broadcast worldwide on MTV in 1994.

68
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:55,459
and I'm a 1990 Nintendo World Championships

69
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,980
Los Angeles City Champion,

70
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,020
so I got one of those awesome cartridges

71
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,700
that you hear about.

72
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,621
And I am the Hawaii State Nintendo Champion,

73
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:03,762
just to name a few highlights.

74
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:06,042
And incidentally, my game career was started

75
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:08,103
when I was discovered at the Nintendo World Championships

76
00:03:08,403 --> 00:03:09,163
when I was still a kid,

77
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,884
and I ended up working at Atari Tengen

78
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:12,184
about a week after that.

79
00:03:13,204 --> 00:03:14,425
Kind of because I was plugging Tetris,

80
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:17,466
I was like, oh, Tengen, hmm, Tengen Tetris, I know that.

81
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:21,067
So eSports and Tetris in particular

82
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:22,867
have led my life down an amazing path.

83
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:27,078
So it makes sense that I continue to be involved in these spaces as a commentator and founding consultant

84
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:29,878
for the Classic Tetris World Championships going on 10 years now.

85
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:33,859
And as you've heard before, I'm the voice of the Boom Tetris for Jeff meme,

86
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,440
and I'll explain that later, but for now I'll start with the most basic description of the Classic Tetris World Championships.

87
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,921
So Tetris for the Nintendo Entertainment System was released in 1989,

88
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:49,262
and it's become one of the most fiercely competitive versions of one of the most beloved games in the world.

89
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,022
But there's a plot twist.

90
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,251
Tetris for the NES does not have a two-player mode.

91
00:03:55,112 --> 00:03:56,433
So what do?

92
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:03,257
Two old CRT TVs are placed next to each other, each connected to an old 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment

93
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,838
System with Tetris game and controller.

94
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:09,701
Two players play the game of Tetris at the same time.

95
00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:12,423
One player walks away a winner.

96
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:18,327
This version of the game was never intended to be played competitively this way.

97
00:04:20,163 --> 00:04:24,004
When recordings of these strange activities with ancient electronics are uploaded to YouTube,

98
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:24,965
people watch.

99
00:04:26,405 --> 00:04:30,207
Our channel has grown to nearly 40 million views, and recently the viewership for live

100
00:04:30,247 --> 00:04:31,427
events has grown exponentially.

101
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:35,248
The Classic Tetris World Championships are truly an anomaly in esports if you break it

102
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:38,750
down to its basics, yet there's a lot more going on that's allowed it to become a beloved

103
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:39,670
esports phenomenon.

104
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,752
At its core are passionate players and fans who love playing a pure, classic version of

105
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,733
a game that some consider to be perfect.

106
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:50,252
We've evolved and improved the format as interest has grown,

107
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:51,213
but it got us thinking.

108
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:53,694
If we've been able to make a game that was never designed

109
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:56,595
to be used for competition into something so compelling,

110
00:04:57,156 --> 00:04:59,237
maybe something important could be learned from it

111
00:04:59,377 --> 00:05:01,078
so that other great competitions, games,

112
00:05:01,238 --> 00:05:02,238
and e-sports may emerge.

113
00:05:02,738 --> 00:05:03,499
And that's why we're here.

114
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,201
So beyond the basics, now we can pull back

115
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,781
and see the bigger practical picture.

116
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:10,782
We're now in our 10th year,

117
00:05:10,962 --> 00:05:13,003
having started from a small, humble community event

118
00:05:13,043 --> 00:05:14,264
held at a Los Angeles theater

119
00:05:14,284 --> 00:05:16,925
and have grown to be a sponsored yearly event season.

120
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:20,485
Regional qualifiers held around the world expand our reach,

121
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:22,266
leading to the world championships in October.

122
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,207
With the world finals being held at the Portland Retro Gaming

123
00:05:25,247 --> 00:05:28,609
Expo since 2012, we've been able to grow alongside this event

124
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:30,930
and help to make Portland an esports destination,

125
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,832
leveraging its already strong retro gaming scene and culture.

126
00:05:34,912 --> 00:05:38,074
We've created a vibrant and friendly competitive community

127
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:40,235
and grown a substantial following along the way,

128
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:42,856
making it the most popular retro esport in the world,

129
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:44,757
with most of our growth happening just

130
00:05:44,797 --> 00:05:45,617
in the last two years.

131
00:05:47,592 --> 00:05:49,054
So to understand how all this happened,

132
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:51,776
it's important to know the retro roots of both the game

133
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,437
and its previous competitive legacy.

134
00:05:54,078 --> 00:05:57,681
In 1989, Nintendo released their versions of Tetris

135
00:05:57,901 --> 00:05:59,523
for the 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System

136
00:05:59,563 --> 00:06:00,083
and Game Boy.

137
00:06:00,584 --> 00:06:02,065
While these were not the earliest versions

138
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:04,227
of the game released, they were the most widely distributed

139
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,168
and heavily marketed versions of the game ever made

140
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:08,410
and served as the first exposure of Tetris

141
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,731
for a generation of gamers.

142
00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:12,033
Tetris would then go on to become

143
00:06:12,054 --> 00:06:13,935
one of the most played and loved video games around the world,

144
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:14,716
as you probably know.

145
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,192
In 1990, Nintendo launched the Nintendo World Championships

146
00:06:19,232 --> 00:06:19,893
in PowerFest.

147
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:21,934
Featuring a stage show with giant screens

148
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:23,355
and live announcers calling the action,

149
00:06:23,595 --> 00:06:25,076
this 30-city tour would challenge

150
00:06:25,196 --> 00:06:26,817
millions across the country and was

151
00:06:26,837 --> 00:06:29,138
the largest competitive gaming event held at the time.

152
00:06:29,738 --> 00:06:31,660
Loosely based on a fictitious competition

153
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,921
in the movie The Wizard, anybody remember that?

154
00:06:35,202 --> 00:06:37,503
Yeah, so it's like, yeah, Fred Savage.

155
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:41,365
It featured a triathlon of games in which

156
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:43,346
Tetris was the final and pivotal game that

157
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:44,847
determined the outcome of the competition.

158
00:06:46,053 --> 00:06:48,314
As video games gained traction to become more mainstream

159
00:06:48,354 --> 00:06:50,855
in the 90s, this first NWC began an era

160
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,156
where console manufacturers like Nintendo and Sega

161
00:06:53,697 --> 00:06:56,018
held massive multi-city competition tours

162
00:06:56,058 --> 00:06:58,899
where players of all ages could enter for free or low cost

163
00:06:59,239 --> 00:07:00,660
and play in a regional to qualify

164
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,020
for a national or world title.

165
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,141
Participants and champions of this era

166
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:06,142
would later be involved in the interest behind

167
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:08,783
and the formation of the classic Tetris World Championships.

168
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:11,284
So decades passed.

169
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:14,654
And as retro gaming rose in popularity along with the growth of the internet,

170
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:18,055
it was found that many people were still interested in playing classic NES Tetris.

171
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:22,156
Information and media such as gameplay videos began to surface.

172
00:07:22,537 --> 00:07:25,378
And in 2009, Harry Hong submitted a video which earned him

173
00:07:25,618 --> 00:07:30,679
the first Twin Galaxies maxed out score of 999,999 points.

174
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,620
This led to the production of a short film, But Harry,

175
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:35,561
by filmmaker Adam Cornelius,

176
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:38,842
and this led to more interest in finding other potential Tetris masters.

177
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,411
Because it seemed that after all of these years,

178
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:45,773
one of the most iconic and widely loved games of all time

179
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,873
did not yet have an official champion.

180
00:07:48,414 --> 00:07:48,634
What?

181
00:07:51,175 --> 00:07:54,676
So, NWC 1990 competitor Robin Mahara

182
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:56,097
teamed up with the filmmaker Adam

183
00:07:56,257 --> 00:07:58,598
and producer Vince Clemente to hold a competition

184
00:07:58,618 --> 00:08:00,058
to answer this unanswered question.

185
00:08:00,558 --> 00:08:02,399
Who is the best Tetris player in the world?

186
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:03,599
On August 8, 2010,

187
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,120
the first Classic Tetris World Championship

188
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:08,261
was held in the Downtown Independent Theater

189
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:08,862
in Los Angeles.

190
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:10,798
and we used the original NES console

191
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:11,979
and the Tetris cartridge from 1989

192
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:14,580
and played it all out on CRT TVs.

193
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,421
The short film Adam has started with

194
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:19,842
now grew to become an award-winning documentary film,

195
00:08:20,182 --> 00:08:21,703
Ecstasy of Order, the Tetris Masters,

196
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:23,744
which chronicles the road to the first championship

197
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:25,885
and reveals what happened to original

198
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:27,565
NWC champion Thor Akerlund.

199
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:30,626
This film would serve to increase interest

200
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,907
in classic Tetris and our competitive scene going forward.

201
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:35,969
So, why NES Tetris?

202
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:37,049
Well,

203
00:08:37,367 --> 00:08:41,029
NES Tetris is considered to be a more basic, difficult, but pure version of Tetris.

204
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:44,911
Pieces lock down nearly instantly when they land, and you can't slide them around.

205
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:46,291
It's really strict.

206
00:08:47,052 --> 00:08:48,693
And there's only one piece in the next window.

207
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:54,815
The basic left and right movement, delayed auto shift behavior, rotation movement rules,

208
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:57,517
and the like are simple but nuanced.

209
00:08:58,077 --> 00:09:02,059
We call it DAS, where you hold down like a space bar on a keyboard, it'll go once, and

210
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:04,980
then it'll go a whole bunch of times after that, auto repeating.

211
00:09:05,266 --> 00:09:06,886
That's what we call DAS, and that's something

212
00:09:06,926 --> 00:09:09,187
that you need to know to play NES Tetris effectively.

213
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:12,227
So it has these mysterious design quirks

214
00:09:12,487 --> 00:09:13,928
that make it compelling and challenging.

215
00:09:14,308 --> 00:09:16,368
But in particular, the scoring displays a maximum

216
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:20,409
of 999,999 points, with a total score being

217
00:09:20,749 --> 00:09:22,230
just on the brink of possibility.

218
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,210
As such, maxing out Tetris is an effective,

219
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,011
attractive, bucket list gaming achievement,

220
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:31,692
and a milestone for Tetris eSports hopefuls.

221
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:37,551
We don't know for sure if this seemingly meticulous balancing was by design or a very happy accident.

222
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:41,112
But many consider this version of Tetris to be perfect as a result.

223
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:46,353
So if you are the programmer of this game out there watching, or know who is, please

224
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:48,894
contact us because we would love to hear from you.

225
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:56,796
So when a player reaches level 29, NES Tetris pieces fall at a rate of one line per frame,

226
00:09:57,256 --> 00:10:01,537
making horizontal movement nearly impossible, resulting in imminent death.

227
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:04,615
This effectively acts as a kill screen,

228
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,916
and will instantly end the game for nearly any player.

229
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:09,236
Only a difficult method of movement,

230
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:12,057
where a player hits the D-pad faster than 10 times a second

231
00:10:12,357 --> 00:10:14,818
to override the delayed auto-shift called hyper-capping,

232
00:10:15,118 --> 00:10:16,538
can allow for further survival.

233
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:20,979
The kill screen behavior is unique to NES Tetris,

234
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,620
and it cannot be played forever,

235
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,240
like classic Tetris variants,

236
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,201
such as Game Boy version or Tengen Tetris,

237
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:29,361
which kind of lets you play forever,

238
00:10:29,381 --> 00:10:30,322
because they're easy like that.

239
00:10:31,562 --> 00:10:35,424
The results of these mechanics create an imminent death situation and round times are around

240
00:10:36,045 --> 00:10:40,528
6 to 9 minutes at most in duration, which are a very good length for an eSports match.

241
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,233
So for a competitive game to be taken seriously as a sport, a standard has to be established

242
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:48,614
which does not change over time.

243
00:10:49,034 --> 00:10:52,397
With NES Tetris, we have a version of the game that served as the first exposure to

244
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:57,420
the franchise for many, has a legacy of tournament usage, is well documented, and has stood the

245
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,041
test of time.

246
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:03,686
As we've seen, players with exceptional skills from the 80s and 90s can still apply their talents even decades later.

247
00:11:04,847 --> 00:11:07,868
Yet the game is still approachable enough for younger or new challengers to succeed.

248
00:11:08,588 --> 00:11:16,390
Our player base doesn't have to worry about new versions, rules, game mechanics, or character nerfs interfering with their mastery of the game.

249
00:11:17,771 --> 00:11:21,352
More recent versions of Tetris have a faster appearance with more hard-drop mechanics.

250
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:25,133
Things teleport all over the place and they're harder to follow visually.

251
00:11:25,956 --> 00:11:27,317
They allow for more room for error,

252
00:11:27,357 --> 00:11:28,718
like you can keep hitting the rotate button

253
00:11:28,758 --> 00:11:30,159
and the pieces will just bounce around.

254
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,182
But we noticed that the slower visual pace of NES Tetris

255
00:11:33,262 --> 00:11:35,263
actually makes the game easier to learn and comprehend.

256
00:11:35,824 --> 00:11:37,825
Its simplicity ultimately makes it more fun to watch

257
00:11:37,886 --> 00:11:40,307
in an eSports context, with misdrop mistakes

258
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:42,829
and life or death situations coming across dramatically.

259
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,652
Our tournaments run on original NES hardware

260
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,613
and game cartridges, which are common and inexpensive

261
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:50,836
to obtain even today, with the game being under five bucks

262
00:11:51,216 --> 00:11:52,918
and old NES system setups well below 50.

263
00:11:54,357 --> 00:11:55,937
Emulation options are also abundant.

264
00:11:56,637 --> 00:11:59,018
A CRT television with no lag is recommended, however.

265
00:11:59,258 --> 00:12:01,599
We run all our events on CRTs, as the precision

266
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:03,300
of classic Tetris is so demanding,

267
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,401
there are one frame windows of error at high levels of play.

268
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,863
Practice skills are directly applicable to the e-sport.

269
00:12:10,283 --> 00:12:12,343
If someone can consistently score high and max out

270
00:12:12,403 --> 00:12:14,464
on NES Tetris, they have a real shot

271
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,245
at becoming world champion, just by playing

272
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:17,545
the game within its own rules.

273
00:12:19,426 --> 00:12:20,367
While I won't go into depth.

274
00:12:20,884 --> 00:12:22,565
completely with Tetris play mechanics,

275
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,147
a quick overview should be mentioned

276
00:12:24,187 --> 00:12:26,048
so that the bigger picture of our format will make sense.

277
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:28,310
In the CTWC, the general strategy

278
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,511
is like most versions of Tetris.

279
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:31,913
Stack cleanly, leaving a one-block space

280
00:12:31,993 --> 00:12:33,074
on the right edge of the play field,

281
00:12:33,354 --> 00:12:34,775
referred to as a well.

282
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:38,158
Then use a long bar I tetromino

283
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,020
to score Tetrises as much as possible.

284
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,482
For our rule set, Tetrises are critical for scoring.

285
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,384
That's why we go a little overboard

286
00:12:45,444 --> 00:12:46,505
celebrating them sometimes.

287
00:12:46,825 --> 00:12:48,487
They're like a touchdown or a jackpot.

288
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,580
Even if they happen pretty frequently in gameplay,

289
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,041
after a player digs themselves out of a bad situation,

290
00:12:53,101 --> 00:12:54,922
it's really satisfying to see them finally score

291
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,903
that well-deserved Tetris comeback.

292
00:12:57,323 --> 00:12:58,323
Boom, Tetris for you.

293
00:12:59,944 --> 00:13:02,705
The best players will score Tetrises as safely as they can

294
00:13:02,745 --> 00:13:04,085
without wasting scoring potential

295
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,726
by clearing lines that are not Tetrises.

296
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,287
Because of the unique behavior of NES Tetris,

297
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:09,987
this must be done within the confines

298
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:13,129
of the 230-line window before the kill screen speed

299
00:13:13,169 --> 00:13:15,970
increase incurs, inevitably ending the game.

300
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:20,389
As players move in and out of peril as the stacks rise and fall,

301
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:22,590
the patterns of victory and defeat are illustrated.

302
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:25,572
The dramatic saves and devastating mistakes are easy to understand,

303
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:27,833
and with that, the visual satisfaction of a puzzle game,

304
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:30,535
we feel all those elements are what make this an eSport

305
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:32,796
that's deceptively compelling and satisfying to watch.

306
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:38,359
So now I'll mention some of what we learned over the years

307
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:40,661
and the evolution of our commentary and terminology.

308
00:13:41,241 --> 00:13:43,422
Many common terms exist in Tetris.

309
00:13:43,602 --> 00:13:45,783
For instance, a Tetris well would be one example that...

310
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:47,417
every version of Tetris would have.

311
00:13:47,717 --> 00:13:49,338
But what's interesting is some unique terms

312
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:51,319
have come into existence specifically

313
00:13:51,359 --> 00:13:53,980
because of the friction created by the CTWC format

314
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,641
and playing the game competitively

315
00:13:55,941 --> 00:13:57,461
in a way that it was never designed to be.

316
00:13:59,062 --> 00:14:01,563
So pace, some players play at a faster pace than others

317
00:14:01,603 --> 00:14:02,804
by pressing down on the D-pad.

318
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:05,145
And even though one player may have a higher score currently

319
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:07,146
if the other player is playing at a slower pace

320
00:14:07,386 --> 00:14:08,686
they may have more lines to work with

321
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:09,727
to maximize their score.

322
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:11,988
So that's important in determining potential outcomes

323
00:14:12,048 --> 00:14:13,028
and knowing who's really ahead.

324
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:15,069
This is something we mention in commentary often.

325
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:17,888
because it's not really obvious to new viewers.

326
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:19,449
Droughts.

327
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,732
NES Tetris has harsh, true random pieces

328
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:25,194
and not a bag randomizer that guarantees piece variety

329
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:26,735
like modern versions of Tetris.

330
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:29,417
This results in a potentially long period

331
00:14:29,457 --> 00:14:30,858
without receiving a certain type of piece,

332
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:33,920
most importantly, that long bar eye tetromino

333
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,841
that's necessary for scoring a Tetris.

334
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:37,823
So when droughts occur, they can be deadly.

335
00:14:39,124 --> 00:14:39,504
Burn.

336
00:14:40,144 --> 00:14:41,646
Champions must know how to stay alive

337
00:14:41,686 --> 00:14:43,287
and survive these droughts by doing a burn

338
00:14:43,307 --> 00:14:44,668
when necessary to clear lines.

339
00:14:45,061 --> 00:14:46,682
singles or doubles, preferably in a way

340
00:14:46,702 --> 00:14:47,642
that doesn't block the well.

341
00:14:48,543 --> 00:14:50,284
If the Tetris well is blocked badly,

342
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:51,725
we sometimes call that a dig.

343
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:54,406
If the dig is successful and the well is open again,

344
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,327
a player is then Tetris ready.

345
00:14:57,948 --> 00:15:00,630
A speed transition is something we highlight in NES Tetris

346
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,890
when a player hits level 19,

347
00:15:02,411 --> 00:15:05,352
since it's an important milestone during CTWC matches,

348
00:15:05,773 --> 00:15:07,193
and you won't see that term used much

349
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,914
outside of this competitive context.

350
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:11,596
Players need to keep their stack as clean as possible

351
00:15:11,656 --> 00:15:12,717
just before the transition,

352
00:15:13,017 --> 00:15:13,757
and awareness of the

353
00:15:14,325 --> 00:15:16,386
the approach of the transition creates anticipation

354
00:15:16,787 --> 00:15:18,167
as their imminent death awaits.

355
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:22,329
Conservative and aggressive play.

356
00:15:22,749 --> 00:15:24,390
So one of the most frequent comments we get,

357
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,631
especially with our commentary,

358
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:27,772
is how we mention aggressive or conservative play.

359
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:29,773
How do you play Tetris aggressively?

360
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,894
You punch your opponent that's sitting next to you?

361
00:15:33,574 --> 00:15:36,176
No, no, what we mean by that is by playing aggressively,

362
00:15:36,496 --> 00:15:39,377
more risks are taken to absolutely maximize the score

363
00:15:39,417 --> 00:15:40,878
by not burning off any unnecessary

364
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:41,978
singles, doubles, or triples.

365
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:44,246
Conversely, playing more safely and burning more lines

366
00:15:44,266 --> 00:15:46,387
will keep you out of trouble, but it won't score as much.

367
00:15:46,907 --> 00:15:48,288
Play too aggressively and you could end up

368
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:50,789
topping out and gaming over, but play too conservatively

369
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:52,770
and your opponent will kick your ass with score.

370
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,531
So terminology helps us be aware of all these factors

371
00:15:56,571 --> 00:15:57,832
that determine the outcome of a match.

372
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:00,293
We can then commentate on them and step with the players

373
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:03,114
as their play styles and personalities become a factor

374
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:04,895
in telling the story that's unfolding

375
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,076
while providing a better understanding of the game.

376
00:16:07,836 --> 00:16:10,097
Playful and relatable metaphors like digging

377
00:16:10,857 --> 00:16:11,898
add fun to the commentary.

378
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:14,658
So there's more to it than just saying, boom, Tetris a lot,

379
00:16:14,818 --> 00:16:16,740
even though I think that helps excite people too.

380
00:16:18,641 --> 00:16:19,541
So check out this screen.

381
00:16:20,262 --> 00:16:22,203
Do you notice anything interesting about this situation,

382
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:23,804
keeping in mind that these players are playing

383
00:16:23,844 --> 00:16:25,686
on two separate NES systems and TVs?

384
00:16:27,847 --> 00:16:28,348
Exactly.

385
00:16:29,308 --> 00:16:31,049
Both players get the same pieces.

386
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,212
So, a special cartridge pass-through device,

387
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:35,552
sort of like a Game Genie,

388
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:37,294
you guys know what a Game Genie is?

389
00:16:38,254 --> 00:16:38,534
All right.

390
00:16:39,295 --> 00:16:41,517
Works with the original NES Tetris cartridge attached.

391
00:16:42,063 --> 00:16:44,624
and provides the same random pea seed for both players

392
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:45,584
in a one-on-one match.

393
00:16:46,204 --> 00:16:48,465
Although we found that top-level players could be very

394
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:50,145
consistent no matter what the pea set was,

395
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:52,166
there was always a question of whether or not

396
00:16:52,286 --> 00:16:53,846
one player had an advantage over the other

397
00:16:53,886 --> 00:16:55,306
if they had different pieces in the match.

398
00:16:55,846 --> 00:16:58,267
With the same pieces for both players now in the same round,

399
00:16:58,547 --> 00:17:00,968
there would never be any doubt of that again,

400
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,608
and that the outcome would be based on skill alone.

401
00:17:04,168 --> 00:17:06,469
So a referee rolls the dice prior to the round starting,

402
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:08,029
and players will enter the number

403
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:09,189
rolled, which will generate one of 1,000

404
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:10,870
possible random pea seeds.

405
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,830
The players don't see the same thing

406
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,071
that the broadcast viewers do.

407
00:17:16,231 --> 00:17:19,433
So we have this overlay that's designed by Trey Harrison.

408
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:22,534
And that's what facilitates not only the gameplay screens

409
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:24,095
and the competitor face cams,

410
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:26,516
but it processes and reinterprets game information

411
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:28,736
in real time, assisting us show runners

412
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,397
and increasing excitement for viewers.

413
00:17:30,997 --> 00:17:33,298
I'll go into a bit of detail on that now.

414
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:38,581
So Score Readout provides automated math

415
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:40,622
with optical character recognition,

416
00:17:40,902 --> 00:17:42,122
highlighting the score differential.

417
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:44,670
Players who are behind will have their difference highlighted

418
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,312
in red, while players who are ahead

419
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:47,953
will have the difference highlighted in green.

420
00:17:49,534 --> 00:17:51,535
This area that you see at the bottom of the screen

421
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:52,636
has a bunch of different stats.

422
00:17:53,216 --> 00:17:55,638
And those stats are not usually available in the game.

423
00:17:55,678 --> 00:17:57,879
So what the game is actually, or what our overlay is doing,

424
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,420
is it's looking at the game.

425
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,421
And every time it sees something,

426
00:18:00,461 --> 00:18:02,822
it's actually keeping that data and processing it,

427
00:18:03,223 --> 00:18:05,764
and then reinterpreting that data for viewers.

428
00:18:06,805 --> 00:18:09,727
So TRT stands for Tetris Percentage Rate,

429
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:10,928
or the percentage of lines.

430
00:18:11,694 --> 00:18:12,975
are that have come from Tetrises.

431
00:18:13,355 --> 00:18:15,516
This is a good measure for how well a player is scoring.

432
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,937
To max out the score, a player needs about 60% or higher

433
00:18:19,317 --> 00:18:20,418
percentage of Tetris lines.

434
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:24,320
BRN stands for burn lines, or how many lines

435
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,660
have been burned between Tetrises.

436
00:18:27,101 --> 00:18:29,222
Then, of course, a glowing long red bar,

437
00:18:30,482 --> 00:18:32,383
if that shows up in our overlay, that

438
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,704
means a drought is taking place.

439
00:18:34,044 --> 00:18:36,145
The number of pieces spawned since the last long bar

440
00:18:36,185 --> 00:18:38,586
or eyepiece appeared is displayed below the icon.

441
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,572
And there's a player name and match wins indicator.

442
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:45,194
The red hearts indicate the number of matches won

443
00:18:45,214 --> 00:18:45,634
in the set.

444
00:18:47,235 --> 00:18:50,877
And this main gameplay area has a context-sensitive overlay

445
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:54,180
that replaces dead screens and menus with logos and stats

446
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,600
which improve viewer comprehension.

447
00:18:57,321 --> 00:18:59,343
Even more useful data and stats will be displayed here

448
00:18:59,423 --> 00:19:00,443
after a player tops out.

449
00:19:01,564 --> 00:19:03,105
And of course, the faces of the competitors

450
00:19:03,145 --> 00:19:05,466
are displayed nice and large, bringing the human element

451
00:19:05,907 --> 00:19:07,688
front and center, and they're always visible.

452
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:13,832
So now to talk a little bit about the path to the championship for a player.

453
00:19:14,512 --> 00:19:17,874
We started this just as a yearly event, but now we hold regionals at satellite events

454
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:18,614
all around the world.

455
00:19:19,175 --> 00:19:23,216
Following Portland Retro Gaming Expo's success came other gaming events growing in their

456
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:28,339
own markets, such as Game On Expo in Phoenix, Arizona, and Retro City Fest in Southern California.

457
00:19:28,979 --> 00:19:33,501
As this network of local convention communities began to form, these up-and-coming shows became

458
00:19:33,561 --> 00:19:35,162
perfect sites for our regional events.

459
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:38,397
Last year, we had five regional qualifier events in the US

460
00:19:38,457 --> 00:19:40,718
and partnered with RetroHK Gaming Expo

461
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:43,860
for our events in Europe, Asia, and regionals

462
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,182
in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Gamescom in Germany.

463
00:19:46,962 --> 00:19:49,664
While we continued the Classic Tetris European Championship,

464
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:52,005
our first event partner, and that one's

465
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,106
been going for a few years now.

466
00:19:54,547 --> 00:19:55,847
While participating in these regionals

467
00:19:55,907 --> 00:19:57,749
is not required to enter the world championships,

468
00:19:58,049 --> 00:19:59,290
it's a nice throwback to the days

469
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,711
when console companies would hold tours where anyone

470
00:20:01,751 --> 00:20:03,372
of any age could come and enter in their region

471
00:20:03,672 --> 00:20:05,633
and win a trip for their shot at the world title.

472
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:08,071
And it's great to be able to give those kinds of opportunities

473
00:20:08,111 --> 00:20:08,911
to players once again.

474
00:20:09,572 --> 00:20:11,934
Growing our format while making the tournament more accessible

475
00:20:12,274 --> 00:20:14,996
and adding incentives for the players is a win for everyone involved.

476
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,538
And these growing events, it's nice to have something

477
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:19,540
that's kind of established at their show,

478
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,901
so people will want to come out to it.

479
00:20:23,062 --> 00:20:26,085
So for our rules and format, qualifying is really simple.

480
00:20:26,545 --> 00:20:28,707
In the qualifying stage, players just play NES Tetris

481
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,989
throughout the day and try to get the highest score that they can.

482
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:33,811
They can either line up and make repeated attempts

483
00:20:33,851 --> 00:20:35,212
getting in line again after they lose,

484
00:20:35,784 --> 00:20:37,065
or rent a station for a fee.

485
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:41,089
These qualifying runs are literally just playing the stock game by themselves and trying for

486
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:41,489
a score.

487
00:20:41,989 --> 00:20:46,634
And this one-to-one performance parity between practicing at home and qualifying makes it

488
00:20:46,694 --> 00:20:53,861
understandable and approachable for hopeful Tetris contenders, and is similar to the player

489
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:56,003
versus player mechanics that are going to follow that.

490
00:20:57,364 --> 00:21:00,747
At the end of the qualifying period, the top scores, eight for a regional

491
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,184
where 32 for the World Championships are rounded up

492
00:21:03,224 --> 00:21:04,484
and entered into a seeded bracket

493
00:21:04,504 --> 00:21:05,605
for the one-on-one matchups.

494
00:21:07,185 --> 00:21:09,385
The bracketed matches are a one-on-one score contest.

495
00:21:09,746 --> 00:21:11,566
Each player plays on a separate NES station.

496
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:13,506
Games are started simultaneously,

497
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:17,227
and they go for a score that can beat their opponents.

498
00:21:18,248 --> 00:21:20,968
There's no direct interaction between the play fields.

499
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:23,849
But if you notice what's going on in that GIF,

500
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:26,630
there's no garbage sending lines unlike some versions

501
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:27,170
of Tetris.

502
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,830
However, players can keep an eye.

503
00:21:30,283 --> 00:21:33,005
on their opponent's screen as a strategy, if they so choose

504
00:21:33,045 --> 00:21:35,847
to do so, and can vary their aggression accordingly.

505
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,329
Interestingly, I noticed that younger players do this far more

506
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:40,450
frequently than the veterans.

507
00:21:42,912 --> 00:21:43,672
Games start at level 18

508
00:21:44,092 --> 00:21:46,034
as it facilitates the highest scoring potential.

509
00:21:46,554 --> 00:21:49,096
Level 18 lasts until a player clears 130 lines,

510
00:21:49,136 --> 00:21:51,417
at which point it transitions and they advance to level 19,

511
00:21:52,098 --> 00:21:53,379
and the game speeds up dramatically

512
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:54,679
with only the best players being able

513
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:56,020
to survive at this higher speed.

514
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,271
The game will stay at this speed, increasing in level and score values until 230 lines

515
00:22:01,531 --> 00:22:04,732
and the level 29 kill screen is reached, where the game soon ends.

516
00:22:05,592 --> 00:22:10,173
The drama and excitement escalates as players race toward their imminent top-out death.

517
00:22:11,614 --> 00:22:15,935
If a player tops out or dies, the other player continues playing until either they top out

518
00:22:16,215 --> 00:22:18,536
or they surpass the score that their opponent has achieved.

519
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:24,138
So let's take a look at one of these match ends.

520
00:22:26,298 --> 00:22:26,818
This is from...

521
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:29,787
2017. So now,

522
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:34,190
just reaching level 26.

523
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,892
Right. At this speed,

524
00:22:36,912 --> 00:22:38,853
it might not be possible

525
00:22:38,893 --> 00:22:39,594
for him to catch up.

526
00:22:43,937 --> 00:22:44,978
He'll have to have a well set up

527
00:22:45,018 --> 00:22:46,219
now and just make all Tetrises.

528
00:22:46,719 --> 00:22:48,881
We have a potential now for a kill screen

529
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:50,802
on our first match from Harry.

530
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:52,924
There it is! So Harry hit the kill screen.

531
00:22:52,944 --> 00:22:54,084
No more Ryan. He's ahead.

532
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:54,565
60,000 point lead.

533
00:22:55,913 --> 00:22:58,355
Bruko needs to make at least two Tetrises to catch up.

534
00:22:58,575 --> 00:22:59,555
Let's see if he can do it.

535
00:22:59,575 --> 00:23:01,296
He's only got two levels to do it right now.

536
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:01,516
27 and 28.

537
00:23:01,556 --> 00:23:03,637
He's going to have to play super aggressive.

538
00:23:04,057 --> 00:23:05,738
Okay, well, he's going for the triple.

539
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,159
That's not going to be enough.

540
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:08,339
He's going to have to go for a Tetris.

541
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,360
Is Tetris or death at this point for Bruko?

542
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,361
Let's see if he can do it.

543
00:23:11,941 --> 00:23:14,962
I think he's going for the second well Tetris right now.

544
00:23:15,182 --> 00:23:16,643
He's going to be able to get it!

545
00:23:16,723 --> 00:23:17,544
Tetris for Bruko!

546
00:23:17,684 --> 00:23:19,304
Oh my God, he's right there.

547
00:23:19,544 --> 00:23:21,505
One more, one more Tetris for Bruko,

548
00:23:21,605 --> 00:23:22,546
and we could see it.

549
00:23:23,605 --> 00:23:27,268
Can he do this? Is he going? Oh, he's going for it! There he is!

550
00:23:27,308 --> 00:23:31,751
Catches Madbruko! Level 29! Killscreen! He has done it!

551
00:23:32,492 --> 00:23:36,855
Wow! So right here at the score now, just...

552
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:43,820
So yeah, Harry's one of the best players in the world, and, you know, he doesn't get taken out very easily at all.

553
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,424
So, the fact that Madbruko was able to see his predicament,

554
00:23:49,204 --> 00:23:52,947
and count the number of lines he had left to even be able to score and possibly win...

555
00:23:53,403 --> 00:23:55,605
If he had made any other lines in that sequence,

556
00:23:56,005 --> 00:23:58,026
he wouldn't have been able to beat Harry, like period.

557
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,728
So he really pulled off like a last second adjustment

558
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:01,909
and that was very impressive.

559
00:24:01,969 --> 00:24:03,249
And to this day, a lot of people say that

560
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:05,671
that's one of the most exciting rounds of Tetris.

561
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:07,332
So I thought I would use that clip

562
00:24:07,432 --> 00:24:09,133
as a way to illustrate how matches end

563
00:24:09,673 --> 00:24:11,274
in the CTWC usually.

564
00:24:13,255 --> 00:24:14,476
So our rules have improved

565
00:24:15,297 --> 00:24:17,798
with most of our format stabilizing in 2016.

566
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,320
Our first year, we didn't have pre-qualified slots.

567
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:23,565
We used to have these pre-qualified slots,

568
00:24:23,585 --> 00:24:25,447
so if you had like a Guinness World Record

569
00:24:25,527 --> 00:24:27,768
or a Twin Galaxies record, you'd get in automatically.

570
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:29,390
But we've done away with that completely.

571
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,271
We now have 40 slots, and all of them

572
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:32,312
have to be earned on site,

573
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:33,633
because if you traveled on one of these things,

574
00:24:33,653 --> 00:24:35,314
you should have a fair shot like everybody else.

575
00:24:36,114 --> 00:24:38,436
We also had rounds for attempting highest lines before,

576
00:24:38,456 --> 00:24:40,197
and that started at level nine,

577
00:24:40,217 --> 00:24:41,878
which is super slow compared to what you see there.

578
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:44,460
And we found that these phases took too long

579
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,442
and didn't provide the excitement,

580
00:24:46,942 --> 00:24:48,943
like the rounds that you make Tetrises in,

581
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:50,505
and that they're rewarded the most.

582
00:24:51,647 --> 00:24:54,248
Grand finals are now three out of five rounds instead of two out of three,

583
00:24:54,268 --> 00:24:56,509
and that provides a more satisfying conclusion.

584
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,852
Since these changes, we've seen huge improvements in our competitors' results,

585
00:25:02,212 --> 00:25:03,813
and increased interest in our scene.

586
00:25:04,913 --> 00:25:07,594
We found that if players have a clear goal knowing what to practice for

587
00:25:07,694 --> 00:25:09,255
and the milestones for their growth,

588
00:25:09,615 --> 00:25:12,457
because those are universal across just playing NES Tetris,

589
00:25:12,717 --> 00:25:15,118
they're more motivated to practice and give it their best shot.

590
00:25:15,898 --> 00:25:18,759
With our qualifying scores constantly getting higher and higher every year

591
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,680
and new contenders rising into the scene,

592
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:25,817
It ends up being a metric for a global, practically viral skill increase on a 30-year-old game

593
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,579
that would probably not otherwise get that kind of attention.

594
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,802
So people are studying it and enjoying it more.

595
00:25:33,663 --> 00:25:38,147
It's very interesting to see that dynamic, because not every game gets to have that.

596
00:25:38,187 --> 00:25:40,428
So it's almost like the game gets a second life from what we're doing.

597
00:25:41,489 --> 00:25:45,492
We stuck with what worked while it continuously improved where we were able to, and running

598
00:25:45,933 --> 00:25:49,735
sort of like eSports in this way is a learning process, and we're always looking for more

599
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:50,316
ways to build.

600
00:25:51,762 --> 00:25:54,982
So our first year, we barely had game screens with labels.

601
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:56,502
I mean, look at that janky pixel name.

602
00:25:56,542 --> 00:25:58,823
I mean, it's like barely acceptable.

603
00:25:58,883 --> 00:25:59,703
But this was back in 2010.

604
00:26:00,083 --> 00:26:02,744
And our tech and broadcast abilities

605
00:26:02,764 --> 00:26:06,024
have since improved with HD output and the stat overlay

606
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:06,364
system.

607
00:26:06,904 --> 00:26:08,085
But that tech has had a purpose.

608
00:26:08,605 --> 00:26:11,245
So you can see here the difference between nine years,

609
00:26:11,925 --> 00:26:13,066
2010 and 2018.

610
00:26:15,986 --> 00:26:18,427
Now, while other e-sports focus mostly on a game screen,

611
00:26:19,076 --> 00:26:21,117
You'll notice that for the Classic Tetris World Championships,

612
00:26:21,217 --> 00:26:24,899
our competitors' faces are featured prominently in the presentation.

613
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,981
And we found it helps viewers connect on a really emotional level with our competitors,

614
00:26:29,381 --> 00:26:32,002
embracing a human element with every mis-dropped wince,

615
00:26:32,502 --> 00:26:34,923
sigh of relief after a crazy dig,

616
00:26:35,524 --> 00:26:38,085
and an imminent death gulp coming across in epic fashion.

617
00:26:39,265 --> 00:26:43,087
Fans really enjoy things like European favorite Yanni's intense expressions

618
00:26:43,267 --> 00:26:44,248
up in the upper left corner,

619
00:26:45,308 --> 00:26:46,729
Matt Bruco's facial antics.

620
00:26:47,347 --> 00:26:50,009
and Green Tea's signature smile, which you see on the left.

621
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,291
We've started to implement hand cameras

622
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,233
to highlight the pure physical skill involved

623
00:26:55,273 --> 00:26:56,554
in maneuvers like hyper-tapping,

624
00:26:56,894 --> 00:26:58,676
and continue to experiment by adding new stats

625
00:26:58,696 --> 00:27:00,357
to the overlay, such as the Tetris percentage

626
00:27:00,397 --> 00:27:02,379
and burn counter, which help illustrate

627
00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:03,960
the complexion of a match better.

628
00:27:05,902 --> 00:27:08,884
Our main set, our main rule set works very well,

629
00:27:09,164 --> 00:27:10,666
but we're still striving to keep things fresh

630
00:27:10,686 --> 00:27:13,027
with other possibilities, and have added side tournaments

631
00:27:13,047 --> 00:27:14,949
for other game variations, which may open the door

632
00:27:14,989 --> 00:27:16,470
for players that may not normally excel.

633
00:27:16,963 --> 00:27:18,224
or participate in the main event.

634
00:27:18,925 --> 00:27:20,887
Last year we had a speed run to level 19.

635
00:27:22,368 --> 00:27:23,909
But of course, Koryan won that

636
00:27:23,949 --> 00:27:25,750
because he's like super fast and super good

637
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,472
and yeah, we didn't have a chance.

638
00:27:28,452 --> 00:27:30,234
And we also had a no next box tournament

639
00:27:30,314 --> 00:27:31,295
which had interesting results

640
00:27:31,355 --> 00:27:33,336
because you'd have players who are normally really good

641
00:27:33,356 --> 00:27:35,098
and they telegraph the next piece really well.

642
00:27:35,378 --> 00:27:36,379
They died really fast.

643
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:37,840
So that was interesting to see.

644
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,082
So this year there's talk of maybe having

645
00:27:40,182 --> 00:27:42,023
a dance pad Tetris battle.

646
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,545
And I for one would love to be part of that.

647
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:46,527
And that'll be a lot of fun for spectators.

648
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,060
So even if you find a formula that works for your main event,

649
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,521
don't stop thinking of new ideas that might be fun to try.

650
00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:54,942
So as our competition grew and evolved,

651
00:27:55,142 --> 00:27:57,202
players developed their own styles and personalities,

652
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:58,603
along with some great stories.

653
00:27:59,143 --> 00:28:00,963
And while it's impossible to mention or show them all,

654
00:28:01,323 --> 00:28:02,864
I'd just like to mention a few that stand out

655
00:28:03,164 --> 00:28:05,644
because they're fun, and they're good at a variety of things.

656
00:28:06,104 --> 00:28:08,385
So Harry Hong, with his unrivaled speed

657
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:09,005
and aggression.

658
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:12,566
Koryan, he's the hyper-tapping grandmaster from Japan.

659
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,781
Alex Kerr is like a genius living encyclopedia of all things Tetris.

660
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:21,042
If we need to know anything, technical trivia, things down to the frame, Alex will know.

661
00:28:22,903 --> 00:28:29,746
The lovable Ben Mullen, the iconic voice of fighting eSports announcer James Chen.

662
00:28:29,906 --> 00:28:32,867
Anyone here know who James Chen is in fighting announcing?

663
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,487
Yeah. He's great to work with.

664
00:28:35,268 --> 00:28:40,429
And the absolute professionalism of Arda Okal, who's a new member of our team.

665
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,950
The entertaining commentary of Heather Ido.

666
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,741
She's married to Jonas, but she's really into Tetris herself and has added a lot to her commentary.

667
00:28:49,281 --> 00:28:52,682
And the memorable antics in Centerwell of Zizeks, or is it Hauser?

668
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:54,362
Because he keeps changing his name every year.

669
00:28:55,442 --> 00:29:02,044
But as the years pass, you know, we have these characters and interesting people that make CTWC what it is.

670
00:29:03,264 --> 00:29:07,785
So now, meet Jonas Neubauer. We're going to start to look at these champions now.

671
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:11,226
He's what we call the GOAT, or Greatest of All Time.

672
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,747
The Michael Jordan of Tetris.

673
00:29:13,254 --> 00:29:17,256
He's won seven Tetris World Championships, including the very first one in 2010,

674
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,618
and is widely considered to be the best NES Tetris player of all time.

675
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:24,900
But he's also become a strong community leader, helping to grow our scene,

676
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,781
running streams where he shares his techniques and provides advice.

677
00:29:28,262 --> 00:29:30,763
He does commentary at regionals and other events,

678
00:29:30,823 --> 00:29:35,705
and he has basically become our Tetris hero, ambassador, and our final boss,

679
00:29:36,086 --> 00:29:39,107
with his consistency and ability to persevere being his trademarks.

680
00:29:40,317 --> 00:29:44,219
I really believe that interest in our scene increased and grew as a result of him being

681
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:45,699
such a positive force for what we do.

682
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,801
And that applies to what this next segment will be about.

683
00:29:49,781 --> 00:29:50,982
And I've got another video to show.

684
00:29:54,864 --> 00:29:58,606
Jonas back in the lead now.

685
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:02,368
Oh, beautiful play right now.

686
00:30:02,528 --> 00:30:03,948
Oh, great stuff for Jonas.

687
00:30:04,738 --> 00:30:06,279
And he's gonna get a Tetris at level 26.

688
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:07,961
Tetris Jonas now with a wide lead of 80,000 points.

689
00:30:08,001 --> 00:30:08,441
The Tetris.

690
00:30:14,423 --> 00:30:15,043
at a high level.

691
00:30:15,283 --> 00:30:16,484
Gonna need some clean up here.

692
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:16,904
There we go.

693
00:30:16,944 --> 00:30:17,905
There's a little bit of clean up.

694
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:18,806
Oh boy.

695
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,086
Things are dangerous for him.

696
00:30:20,307 --> 00:30:21,307
So he's gotta clean now.

697
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:22,008
He's gotta clean.

698
00:30:22,048 --> 00:30:22,928
But he couldn't get the piece.

699
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:23,168
Yeah.

700
00:30:23,348 --> 00:30:24,809
He didn't get the piece all the way over there.

701
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:26,070
He's got a hundred thousand lead.

702
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,351
He has to count on Joseph.

703
00:30:27,371 --> 00:30:29,712
But Joseph, he's been able to do it before.

704
00:30:29,932 --> 00:30:31,133
He's made it to level 32.

705
00:30:31,733 --> 00:30:33,254
It's all up to this right now.

706
00:30:33,354 --> 00:30:33,635
The pressure.

707
00:30:33,655 --> 00:30:36,436
Staying alive and making it to Tetrises could mean the victory here.

708
00:30:36,496 --> 00:30:36,837
Boom.

709
00:30:36,857 --> 00:30:37,557
Tetris for Joseph.

710
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:47,965
Three more the pressure is on the kid right now crazy build going on always going

711
00:30:49,506 --> 00:30:55,649
One and change will do it and a long bar is it gonna come where is it or is there gonna be a drought?

712
00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:01,073
How's this gonna play out? Oh, that's perfect. Perfect. It's set up now. He's still waiting peace trout

713
00:31:03,357 --> 00:31:05,438
17th P-Strap, there's the load of fire!

714
00:31:05,538 --> 00:31:08,360
There it is, Tetris for Joseph!

715
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,022
And we have a new Tetris World Champion!

716
00:31:12,862 --> 00:31:16,524
16 year old Joseph Zaley has done it!

717
00:31:17,205 --> 00:31:17,765
Oh my goodness!

718
00:31:17,805 --> 00:31:21,227
He is your new classic Tetris World Champion

719
00:31:21,287 --> 00:31:24,769
taking it away from 7 time champion Jonas Neubauer!

720
00:31:25,189 --> 00:31:27,990
The young kid on the block, he has done it!

721
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,151
Unprecedented results!

722
00:31:30,211 --> 00:31:32,653
Jonas back in the lead

723
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:42,088
So yeah, that was this last past CTWC 2018 Grand Finals.

724
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,550
Now meet Joseph Saley.

725
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:51,573
He became interested in competitive Tetris after watching the 2016 championship videos

726
00:31:51,633 --> 00:31:55,235
on YouTube, you know, boom Tetris for Jeff, and he liked the memes.

727
00:31:55,996 --> 00:32:00,458
He then watched Jonas' streams on Twitch and ended up learning the game really quickly.

728
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:03,574
In 2018, with his crazy, hyper-tapping skills,

729
00:32:03,914 --> 00:32:05,815
he became the first player to reach level 31,

730
00:32:06,316 --> 00:32:07,897
then the first player to reach level 32.

731
00:32:08,497 --> 00:32:10,219
He did a one-handed max out.

732
00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:12,220
If you notice, he actually holds his controller

733
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,301
differently than everybody else.

734
00:32:14,121 --> 00:32:15,322
At the age of 16, he entered

735
00:32:15,342 --> 00:32:16,883
the classic Tetris World Championships,

736
00:32:17,504 --> 00:32:18,985
his first gaming competition ever,

737
00:32:19,325 --> 00:32:20,726
just to see if he could qualify,

738
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:22,147
and because he wanted to hang out

739
00:32:22,187 --> 00:32:23,728
with us Tetris players and people,

740
00:32:24,068 --> 00:32:25,689
not having any expectations for himself.

741
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,891
He ended up tearing through the bracket.

742
00:32:28,202 --> 00:32:32,464
before taking on the seven-time champion Jonas Neubauer and swept him 3-0.

743
00:32:33,705 --> 00:32:35,586
Joseph Saley is the current Tetris world champion,

744
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:39,849
showing the world that anyone, any age, can learn and master classic Tetris,

745
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:43,772
opening the doors to a new generation and the future. We couldn't have written a

746
00:32:43,812 --> 00:32:45,753
better or more dramatic Cinderella story,

747
00:32:46,013 --> 00:32:49,435
but it happened, and our Tetris ambassador Jonas showed nothing but the highest

748
00:32:49,475 --> 00:32:51,016
caliber of class and sportsmanship,

749
00:32:51,557 --> 00:32:54,739
happy to pass the torch on to this new generation, well at least until

750
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:56,080
this year's World Championships.

751
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:57,960
Now if you look at these stats,

752
00:32:59,141 --> 00:33:00,702
Jotus Neubauer is a DAS user,

753
00:33:01,142 --> 00:33:03,584
and Joseph Saley is a hyper-tapper.

754
00:33:03,684 --> 00:33:05,205
So there's two different styles that work there.

755
00:33:05,546 --> 00:33:07,827
You have a veteran who's kind of like from the NES era,

756
00:33:08,067 --> 00:33:09,889
and then you have Joseph who wasn't even alive

757
00:33:09,969 --> 00:33:11,190
when that stuff was being made.

758
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:14,292
So there's a lot of interesting things going on

759
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,475
just in Tetris right now, competitively.

760
00:33:19,676 --> 00:33:22,478
So we're gonna talk a little bit about our community

761
00:33:22,518 --> 00:33:23,319
and what makes it great.

762
00:33:23,939 --> 00:33:25,140
We think that anything that's

763
00:33:25,635 --> 00:33:29,418
evolving into an eSport can kind of learn from what's happened with us.

764
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:34,222
Our community base started with internet forums and rounding up of top players when we first

765
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,966
started looking for them and to make that ecstasy of order, the Tetris Masters documentary,

766
00:33:39,326 --> 00:33:43,169
and when we first started the CTWC to find out who the best Tetris player in the world

767
00:33:43,209 --> 00:33:43,389
was.

768
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:49,234
There are communities for modern Tetris, like Hard Drop, and many of their top players cross

769
00:33:49,314 --> 00:33:51,476
over in their involvement between classic and modern Tetris.

770
00:33:52,027 --> 00:33:53,788
As other resources such as YouTube and Twitch

771
00:33:53,828 --> 00:33:56,830
increased in popularity, interest in the CTWC grew,

772
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:58,891
and new players began to join the fray.

773
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:02,133
Something we have in common with speedrunning communities

774
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,034
is the sharing of information and resources.

775
00:34:04,594 --> 00:34:06,195
Former world champion Harry Hong

776
00:34:06,655 --> 00:34:08,056
was one of the first players to stream,

777
00:34:08,616 --> 00:34:10,577
and Jonas Eubauer followed suit not long after.

778
00:34:11,318 --> 00:34:13,059
Current champion Joseph was even streaming,

779
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:15,260
displaying his techniques as he was learning them

780
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,781
for himself on the roads of the 2018 championship.

781
00:34:17,801 --> 00:34:18,982
This was before he even won.

782
00:34:20,037 --> 00:34:21,977
All of these interactions make our community strong,

783
00:34:22,357 --> 00:34:24,778
friendly, and approachable, despite the high levels

784
00:34:24,818 --> 00:34:25,579
of skill involved.

785
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,020
One thing we notice is how happy and energized

786
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,081
we are as a community just to see each other succeed.

787
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:34,002
We have a quirky and fun culture.

788
00:34:34,222 --> 00:34:36,462
People new to seeing what we do seem to be attracted to it

789
00:34:36,502 --> 00:34:38,123
because we just seem like we're having a blast

790
00:34:38,183 --> 00:34:40,124
and we're all so chill and sportsmanlike.

791
00:34:40,804 --> 00:34:42,365
Many people have commented that they just wanna go

792
00:34:42,385 --> 00:34:44,045
to Portland to hang out with us and play Tetris

793
00:34:44,065 --> 00:34:47,346
and try to qualify, and they end up being contributors

794
00:34:47,366 --> 00:34:48,127
to our community.

795
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,277
and become more friends to hang out with.

796
00:34:53,017 --> 00:34:55,318
And speaking of quirky, there's the memes.

797
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,602
So, most of you probably saw it on the way in, or before,

798
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:05,745
but just because this is gonna be uploaded to the GDC Vault,

799
00:35:05,805 --> 00:35:06,765
I'm gonna have to play it again.

800
00:35:07,986 --> 00:35:10,507
So this 2016 finals video with Jeff Moore

801
00:35:10,547 --> 00:35:12,188
and Jonas Neubauer went viral,

802
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:14,190
with nearly 10 million views,

803
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,091
and this screenshot's actually from today.

804
00:35:16,691 --> 00:35:17,051
It's at like 9,950,

805
00:35:19,897 --> 00:35:23,919
35.4 so it's like this weekend it's gonna hit 10 million. I was really hoping it would hit it before today

806
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:29,463
But like I even told like our social media people like come on get you know get on the horn tell people to go

807
00:35:29,903 --> 00:35:34,466
To bang on that link to to get it to 10 million. It'll happen. It's okay

808
00:35:38,589 --> 00:35:39,350
But this is

813

00:38:03,984 --> 00:38:04,624
NECK AND NECK

869
00:38:04,644 --> 00:38:05,645
BOOM TETRIS FOR JEFF

870
00:38:05,705 --> 00:38:08,405
is not gonna happen

871
00:38:08,685 --> 00:38:09,566
and your winner

872
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,666
JOTUS NEWBAUER

873
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,211
So sorry for having to see that again, and hopefully you're not too sick of it by now.

874
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:24,652
The meme will always live, I hope.

875
00:38:25,392 --> 00:38:27,912
So Boom Tetris for Jeff caught on as a meme.

876
00:38:28,232 --> 00:38:33,373
Most of the 15,000 comments on the 2016 finals video are Boom Tetris for Jeff, or some variation.

877
00:38:33,793 --> 00:38:37,774
And then there's these compilation videos I need to thank Procrast for making that,

878
00:38:37,894 --> 00:38:43,015
because it really sort of, I don't know, condensed everything that was great about Boom Tetris

879
00:38:43,035 --> 00:38:45,756
for Jeff into one video, and it's the best one out there.

880
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:48,081
Some people love it, some people hate it.

881
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:52,405
I was completely unaware of Boom Tetris for Jeff until months later.

882
00:38:53,586 --> 00:38:57,370
And by then, they were already making t-shirts for the meme, like this.

883
00:38:59,012 --> 00:39:03,637
And it's a really great shirt, and if you buy one of these, it actually helps support

884
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:05,959
the CTWC, so that's another good thing.

885
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,123
By the way, this is Alan, another teenager who got into NES Tetris thanks to the memes.

886
00:39:10,758 --> 00:39:12,599
And he's already nearly a maxed out player,

887
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:15,222
and he qualified in the top eight in our West Coast

888
00:39:15,262 --> 00:39:16,583
Regionals this January.

889
00:39:17,123 --> 00:39:20,966
And I've noticed a pattern, and the younger players out there

890
00:39:21,327 --> 00:39:22,388
really like the memes.

891
00:39:22,728 --> 00:39:24,970
And the fact that Joseph and Alan both

892
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:27,151
got into it because of it, there's something there.

893
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:29,093
Like, you can't force a meme, but if you're

894
00:39:29,173 --> 00:39:32,276
able to kind of roll with it and embrace them,

895
00:39:32,596 --> 00:39:35,939
then you could introduce a new generation to your game.

896
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:36,679
It's crazy.

897
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,840
It's a great story, though.

898
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:42,819
So to explain a little, the reason why I even say,

899
00:39:42,939 --> 00:39:45,061
boom Tetris for, you know, everybody,

900
00:39:46,161 --> 00:39:47,442
I've done that ever since our first year.

901
00:39:48,483 --> 00:39:50,564
Its origin is a nod to when the Nintendo World

902
00:39:50,584 --> 00:39:52,425
Championships announcers would occasionally say,

903
00:39:52,825 --> 00:39:55,627
boom Tetris, because the kids back then

904
00:39:55,707 --> 00:39:57,028
wouldn't make Tetrises too often,

905
00:39:57,068 --> 00:39:58,168
so it was a little bit more special.

906
00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:00,790
And it actually predates boom headshot,

907
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:03,371
because FPSs and separate head collisions

908
00:40:03,431 --> 00:40:04,372
didn't exist back in 1990.

909
00:40:04,472 --> 00:40:08,234
In the 2016 finals, I said boom Tetris for Jeff

910
00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:09,375
so much by accident.

911
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,101
people thought I was biased, or they thought I had a thing for Jeff or something.

912
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:14,861
I mean, I like Jeff, but not that way.

913
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:19,443
One time I screwed up and said, you know, boom Tetris for Jeff,

914
00:40:19,463 --> 00:40:20,703
when Jonas had made a Tetris.

915
00:40:20,843 --> 00:40:22,584
And that was pretty embarrassing.

916
00:40:23,364 --> 00:40:25,485
And in fact, when I first saw how big the response was,

917
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:27,826
and that there were 6 million views at the time,

918
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,107
and all the comments were like, boom Tetris for Jeff,

919
00:40:30,147 --> 00:40:33,328
and some people were hating on it, I thought it meant my doom.

920
00:40:33,568 --> 00:40:36,549
I actually thought I really screwed up, and I was like, hanging my head down.

921
00:40:36,629 --> 00:40:39,210
And I was like, man, I'm so totally fired.

922
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:42,240
I'm like, it was nice doing the commentator gig,

923
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,501
but it's over now.

924
00:40:44,721 --> 00:40:46,943
Then Vince told me, no, you're doing a great job.

925
00:40:46,983 --> 00:40:48,504
And I'm like, you're crazy.

926
00:40:48,544 --> 00:40:50,446
I just kept saying the same thing over and over again.

927
00:40:50,486 --> 00:40:51,566
Like, that's not professional.

928
00:40:52,287 --> 00:40:54,509
But it became evident that it had this amazing effect

929
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:55,069
on our scene.

930
00:40:55,649 --> 00:40:57,751
Fans would talk about how they love the CTWC

931
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,552
and got into it because of Boom Tetris for Jeff.

932
00:40:59,592 --> 00:41:00,473
And I'm like, really?

933
00:41:00,493 --> 00:41:03,635
I think it sank in when I ended up on this ESA panel

934
00:41:03,655 --> 00:41:05,497
on eSports at San Diego Comic-Con last year.

935
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:07,358
And the family wanted a picture with me.

936
00:41:07,698 --> 00:41:08,018
And they said.

937
00:41:08,327 --> 00:41:11,669
we've never seen you before, but we know your voice really well,

938
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:14,791
pointing out that their kids watch Boom Tetris for Jeff

939
00:41:14,991 --> 00:41:17,032
over and over and over again, like a drug.

940
00:41:17,993 --> 00:41:20,114
So I've learned to embrace it and have fun with it.

941
00:41:21,915 --> 00:41:25,137
And it seems like it seeped back into the games themselves.

942
00:41:25,918 --> 00:41:29,280
I was really moved that this appeared in Tetris Effect, which is

943
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,602
you know like one of the newer games that came out for it, and that was the

944
00:41:32,622 --> 00:41:35,923
trophy, Boom Tetris was a trophy, and that was like a nod to our competitive

945
00:41:35,944 --> 00:41:36,384
community.

946
00:41:37,116 --> 00:41:39,837
That really made me feel like what we were doing

947
00:41:39,937 --> 00:41:43,199
made a difference and put something nice back into Tetris,

948
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:44,559
increasing the interest in it.

949
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,061
And if you look on the right side, that's Tetris 99.

950
00:41:48,221 --> 00:41:50,742
And they could have any effect that they wanted to

951
00:41:50,822 --> 00:41:51,602
for the KO.

952
00:41:51,622 --> 00:41:53,883
I would think they would just say KO,

953
00:41:54,024 --> 00:41:55,524
but they made it actually say boom.

954
00:41:56,164 --> 00:41:57,265
So that was pretty cool.

955
00:41:59,026 --> 00:42:00,346
And that game's really popular right now.

956
00:42:00,506 --> 00:42:01,687
Are you guys out there playing Tetris 99?

957
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:02,087
Nice.

958
00:42:04,828 --> 00:42:05,529
Couple people out there.

959
00:42:05,569 --> 00:42:06,349
How about Tetris Effect?

960
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:11,429
Okay, just gotta gauge some popularity out there.

961
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:14,050
So when any kind of Tetris is now seen,

962
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,031
especially on the internet,

963
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:16,611
you know, the common reaction is like,

964
00:42:16,631 --> 00:42:17,592
boom, Tetris for Jeff now.

965
00:42:17,652 --> 00:42:20,233
I was watching the Nintendo World Championships,

966
00:42:20,253 --> 00:42:20,693
I think it was 2017,

967
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:22,874
and they had Tetris as one of the games,

968
00:42:23,174 --> 00:42:24,134
and the chat room was just like,

969
00:42:24,154 --> 00:42:25,595
boom, Tetris for Jeffing, and there,

970
00:42:25,675 --> 00:42:26,535
and Jeff wasn't there, so.

971
00:42:26,635 --> 00:42:30,397
You know, we've got other memes like,

972
00:42:30,437 --> 00:42:31,757
neck and neck, and peacement places,

973
00:42:31,837 --> 00:42:33,438
but they aren't as universal and well-loved

974
00:42:33,498 --> 00:42:34,358
as boom, Tetris for Jeff.

975
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:37,958
And here's some of the comments that showed up on the YouTube video.

976
00:42:39,038 --> 00:42:42,079
That meme helped to get people watching Competitive Tetris.

977
00:42:42,779 --> 00:42:43,739
But a funny thing happened.

978
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,880
People would stay and watch the whole thing, not know where the time went.

979
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,721
That was a common thread in the comments.

980
00:42:50,181 --> 00:42:53,622
The sticky attribute where people click on the video and end up watching the whole thing,

981
00:42:54,522 --> 00:42:58,243
we think it could be the cause of the YouTube algorithm recommending our videos,

982
00:42:58,443 --> 00:43:01,004
you know, like the 2016 finals, over and over again,

983
00:43:01,064 --> 00:43:04,585
and expanding it to a wider audience, because I guess they know what people actually watch.

984
00:43:05,935 --> 00:43:09,377
And many viewers would then get hooked and go and binge watch the rest of our videos.

985
00:43:10,397 --> 00:43:12,998
So, the meme just did great things for us.

986
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:17,560
Now to go to sort of like a darker side of where we were,

987
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:21,862
we almost didn't survive. Like this, the CTWC

988
00:43:22,202 --> 00:43:25,964
came on the brink of being just ended, because after our first

989
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:29,825
tournament in 2010, we wanted to continue it, but you know, it takes money

990
00:43:29,865 --> 00:43:32,547
and it takes resources and time and people have to work hard on it.

991
00:43:33,232 --> 00:43:36,314
And our second event in 2011 took place at USC Los Angeles.

992
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:38,036
So we didn't have the kind of foot traffic

993
00:43:38,056 --> 00:43:40,038
that we do at, say, Portland Retro Gaming Expo.

994
00:43:40,438 --> 00:43:41,899
And not a lot of people knew about it.

995
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,382
And it cost a lot to rent out a venue

996
00:43:45,462 --> 00:43:47,664
and to run everything on your own.

997
00:43:47,704 --> 00:43:49,986
And we did have help from EA, who was a Tetris

998
00:43:50,006 --> 00:43:50,747
licensee at the time.

999
00:43:50,807 --> 00:43:52,528
But it was just insurmountable.

1000
00:43:52,568 --> 00:43:54,750
We didn't think that we'd be able to do one in 2012.

1001
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:56,352
Things looked grim, and it looked

1002
00:43:56,392 --> 00:43:58,213
like we were going to top out and game over.

1003
00:43:59,822 --> 00:44:00,902
But we were saved by a miracle.

1004
00:44:01,223 --> 00:44:03,704
For our third year, we were encouraged by Chuck Van Pelt,

1005
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,125
who runs the Portland Retro Gaming Expo,

1006
00:44:05,145 --> 00:44:06,446
to have the event at his show,

1007
00:44:06,786 --> 00:44:08,928
since some of our founders, like Adam and Robin, were local.

1008
00:44:09,508 --> 00:44:10,309
So we gave it a shot.

1009
00:44:10,969 --> 00:44:12,330
And I didn't want to go there,

1010
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:13,291
because I was just like, man,

1011
00:44:13,311 --> 00:44:14,952
I'm going to all these anime cons

1012
00:44:14,972 --> 00:44:16,673
and all these video game events.

1013
00:44:16,733 --> 00:44:18,474
And I didn't want to have to go to another state

1014
00:44:18,895 --> 00:44:21,416
to do this thing, but I was like, you know what?

1015
00:44:22,037 --> 00:44:23,158
I like what you guys are doing,

1016
00:44:23,418 --> 00:44:24,559
and I felt a connection to it.

1017
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:26,860
So I went up there, and I slept on Adam's floor,

1018
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,841
and I'm like, all right, I'll go and commentate your thing.

1019
00:44:29,531 --> 00:44:32,252
So I went there and I went to the Portland Retro Gaming Expo

1020
00:44:32,553 --> 00:44:33,473
and I freaking loved it.

1021
00:44:33,673 --> 00:44:35,794
Like all these retro games, I just like, you know,

1022
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:37,875
bought all this stuff that I couldn't get anywhere else

1023
00:44:37,915 --> 00:44:40,056
and I liked the culture and what they did

1024
00:44:40,076 --> 00:44:40,937
for retro gaming there.

1025
00:44:41,017 --> 00:44:43,358
So even if I didn't have this gig,

1026
00:44:43,478 --> 00:44:46,320
I would just go there just to go and have fun at the expo

1027
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,560
and hang out with my friends and stuff.

1028
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:48,701
So great show.

1029
00:44:50,402 --> 00:44:52,523
So having the tournament at the Retro Gaming Expo

1030
00:44:52,543 --> 00:44:54,584
gave us an excited built-in audience for free.

1031
00:44:54,904 --> 00:44:56,325
And this was a huge turning point for us.

1032
00:44:57,146 --> 00:44:59,487
Because with the CTWC now having a permanent home,

1033
00:44:59,727 --> 00:45:00,888
we didn't have to worry about the venue

1034
00:45:00,928 --> 00:45:01,829
and the other logistics,

1035
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:03,570
and it freed up our time and resources

1036
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:04,770
to focus on what mattered most,

1037
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:06,792
and expand and improve the tournament.

1038
00:45:07,952 --> 00:45:10,674
So they experienced, the Portland Retro Gaming Expo

1039
00:45:10,714 --> 00:45:13,155
experienced a huge surge in growth around that time,

1040
00:45:13,215 --> 00:45:14,316
and we were able to grow with it.

1041
00:45:14,856 --> 00:45:17,078
As interest in the CTWC increased in recent years,

1042
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:18,899
more people are now traveling Portland

1043
00:45:18,959 --> 00:45:21,380
specifically to compete in and spectate the CTWC.

1044
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:23,462
Symbiotic relationships can be pretty awesome.

1045
00:45:24,912 --> 00:45:28,693
So when we first started this, we didn't know whether we'd be able to get official backing

1046
00:45:28,733 --> 00:45:31,615
and approval from the IP holders of Tetris, even though I used to work for them.

1047
00:45:32,115 --> 00:45:33,415
The Tetris company are BPS.

1048
00:45:33,836 --> 00:45:38,978
So we did contact them, and Hank showed up at our first tournament, and Alexei even sent

1049
00:45:39,018 --> 00:45:39,398
a video.

1050
00:45:39,418 --> 00:45:39,998
It was pretty cool.

1051
00:45:40,879 --> 00:45:44,100
We put the honest work and effort into it, and I think that's why we were able to get

1052
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,441
them to do that for our first event.

1053
00:45:46,001 --> 00:45:50,083
We would later see involvement from companies like EA, Ubisoft, Sega, and most recently

1054
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:51,463
Enhance, with Tetris Effect.

1055
00:45:52,084 --> 00:45:54,165
Our community and professionalism was a key part of that.

1056
00:45:54,763 --> 00:45:56,604
members of our staff and founders having backgrounds

1057
00:45:56,644 --> 00:45:58,744
in production, events, competitive gaming,

1058
00:45:58,784 --> 00:46:00,145
and eSports played a huge factor.

1059
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:04,886
So this grassroots yet official eSports event dream,

1060
00:46:05,366 --> 00:46:05,986
it can be done.

1061
00:46:06,666 --> 00:46:09,547
And with a brand as iconic and important as Tetris,

1062
00:46:10,127 --> 00:46:13,908
we're very happy that it's not only growing new competitors

1063
00:46:13,968 --> 00:46:16,188
and champions, but what we do reflects back positively

1064
00:46:16,568 --> 00:46:18,048
back on the Tetris brand and the games

1065
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:19,129
that we all love and cherish.

1066
00:46:20,689 --> 00:46:22,409
So while the focus of our tournament activities

1067
00:46:22,469 --> 00:46:23,750
is the classic NES Tetris,

1068
00:46:24,035 --> 00:46:26,477
We also help promote the current or newest versions of it.

1069
00:46:27,058 --> 00:46:29,239
Most recently, we partnered with Enhanced Games

1070
00:46:29,259 --> 00:46:30,981
for Tetris Effect on PlayStation VR,

1071
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:34,203
with special demos at the CTWC,

1072
00:46:34,524 --> 00:46:37,046
and legendary game designer Tetsuya Mizuguchi present.

1073
00:46:37,266 --> 00:46:38,226
I didn't even know he was coming,

1074
00:46:38,246 --> 00:46:39,968
and when he showed up, I almost had a heart attack.

1075
00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:43,350
He's actually here this year too at GDC,

1076
00:46:43,390 --> 00:46:46,753
so hopefully some of you have seen his session as well.

1077
00:46:47,694 --> 00:46:50,376
Top players in our Tetris community

1078
00:46:50,496 --> 00:46:52,738
were also on hand to provide developer feedback for them.

1079
00:46:53,182 --> 00:46:54,902
and to show off their moves in a special tournament.

1080
00:46:56,043 --> 00:46:57,523
We also have side tournaments on popular,

1081
00:46:57,563 --> 00:46:59,924
newer Tetris variants such as Tetris the Grandmaster,

1082
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,485
those are some arcade games.

1083
00:47:02,285 --> 00:47:05,446
And the CTWC has then become a celebration

1084
00:47:05,466 --> 00:47:08,027
of all things Tetris, and licensee partners

1085
00:47:08,047 --> 00:47:10,268
and IP holders all look forward to every year

1086
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:11,609
bringing the old and new together.

1087
00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:15,290
So even prior to our last tournament,

1088
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,951
one of our CTWC stars and organizers, Trey Harrison,

1089
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:19,331
was featured in a pre-released

1090
00:47:19,351 --> 00:47:21,232
Tetris Effect VR demo video on YouTube.

1091
00:47:21,825 --> 00:47:23,765
And it quickly gained 8 million plus views,

1092
00:47:23,785 --> 00:47:25,105
helping to promote the upcoming title.

1093
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:28,526
We look forward to helping strengthen the Tetris brand

1094
00:47:28,546 --> 00:47:30,466
in ways like this going on into the future.

1095
00:47:31,947 --> 00:47:32,927
So here's some takeaways.

1096
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:35,247
Know your game well, inside and out,

1097
00:47:35,687 --> 00:47:38,008
if you want to have an e-sport kind of like happen for it.

1098
00:47:38,248 --> 00:47:40,028
But be sure to reach out and enlist experts

1099
00:47:40,068 --> 00:47:41,888
on the game who know its rules, mechanics.

1100
00:47:44,389 --> 00:47:45,869
Oh, making sure your video signal's OK.

1101
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:46,229
OK.

1102
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:50,130
Make sure that you enlist experts on the game who

1103
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:54,763
rules, mechanics, and nuances, because they might also

1104
00:47:54,803 --> 00:47:55,984
become your potential competitors

1105
00:47:56,244 --> 00:47:57,485
and the heroes of your e-sport.

1106
00:47:58,186 --> 00:48:00,688
The CTWC wouldn't have started had this step not

1107
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:01,709
been taken a decade ago.

1108
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:05,812
A great rule set can make almost any game fun for competition.

1109
00:48:06,193 --> 00:48:07,634
So find what's most fun about your game

1110
00:48:07,654 --> 00:48:09,175
and bring out the competitive aspect of it.

1111
00:48:09,596 --> 00:48:11,237
For example, the best excitement in Tetris

1112
00:48:11,277 --> 00:48:13,679
is about building and scoring Tetrises,

1113
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:17,663
pushing the limits of survival, not just playing fast or playing

1114
00:48:17,683 --> 00:48:17,963
forever.

1115
00:48:19,365 --> 00:48:21,526
Stats and metrics that encourage analysis and discussion

1116
00:48:21,567 --> 00:48:23,548
and adding elements that make it easier for audiences

1117
00:48:23,588 --> 00:48:24,748
to understand what's going on,

1118
00:48:25,088 --> 00:48:26,749
help make it more fun to watch,

1119
00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:28,330
leading to audience expansion.

1120
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,651
And if a high-tech method of conveying it

1121
00:48:30,931 --> 00:48:32,212
isn't possible like what we're doing,

1122
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:33,613
you can just do it through commentary.

1123
00:48:35,054 --> 00:48:37,235
So we're nerdy, we're quirky, and we're super welcoming

1124
00:48:37,735 --> 00:48:39,096
with strong sportsmanship,

1125
00:48:39,316 --> 00:48:41,077
and we all love seeing each other succeed.

1126
00:48:41,677 --> 00:48:43,198
And one awesome thing that our social media

1127
00:48:43,218 --> 00:48:45,299
has been doing lately is posting and retweeting

1128
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,480
the accomplishments of all walks of players

1129
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,861
on their journey through Tetris mastery.

1130
00:48:49,177 --> 00:48:50,498
whether it be a new personal best

1131
00:48:50,938 --> 00:48:52,539
in an attempt to max out NES Tetris,

1132
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,541
or finally winning that first Victory Royale on Tetris 99.

1133
00:48:56,522 --> 00:48:57,863
Celebrating each other's successes

1134
00:48:58,023 --> 00:48:59,504
in the nature of what we do.

1135
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:03,827
And we're very proud that we love being an example

1136
00:49:03,847 --> 00:49:06,588
of the very best of what video games can represent.

1137
00:49:07,469 --> 00:49:09,310
When you have a story in which a 16-year-old kid

1138
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:12,032
watched our championships, got into it because of the memes,

1139
00:49:12,352 --> 00:49:13,813
learned from the world champion on Twitch,

1140
00:49:14,233 --> 00:49:16,335
then became champion himself in just a year.

1141
00:49:16,973 --> 00:49:20,394
the dream of eSports suddenly becomes within reach for everyone.

1142
00:49:22,235 --> 00:49:24,615
So, find partners with common goals and audiences.

1143
00:49:25,795 --> 00:49:28,856
Retro gaming events made a lot of sense for us

1144
00:49:28,936 --> 00:49:33,337
because having a common audience, you know, it brought

1145
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:36,318
our players to their event and it gave us an audience.

1146
00:49:36,678 --> 00:49:39,358
Like, that just watched our stuff because it was going on in the background.

1147
00:49:40,438 --> 00:49:44,939
I'm still shocked that people are okay with missing out on all those great deals of retro games that happen when the show is closing,

1148
00:49:44,999 --> 00:49:45,940
but, you know, that's just me.

1149
00:49:47,447 --> 00:49:50,688
For those communities seeking sponsorship or endorsements

1150
00:49:50,908 --> 00:49:53,629
from events and IP holders, showing a strength of community

1151
00:49:53,669 --> 00:49:55,190
and running events professionally, even

1152
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:58,051
without their official blessing, can potentially earn it.

1153
00:49:58,592 --> 00:50:00,212
We're fortunate things happen the way they did,

1154
00:50:00,513 --> 00:50:01,993
but there are other examples of this happening,

1155
00:50:02,053 --> 00:50:04,374
such as in the fighting game scene or another NES

1156
00:50:04,834 --> 00:50:07,356
favorite, Tecmo Bowl, with the Tecmo Madison tournaments.

1157
00:50:08,096 --> 00:50:10,257
The prospect of growing a strong e-sports presence

1158
00:50:10,317 --> 00:50:11,718
is attractive to many IP holders.

1159
00:50:11,998 --> 00:50:14,039
So if you're a fan with a plan and a good community,

1160
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:14,819
it may be possible.

1161
00:50:16,272 --> 00:50:18,294
Our internet presence started off small and humble,

1162
00:50:18,634 --> 00:50:19,815
but we didn't let that deter us

1163
00:50:19,835 --> 00:50:20,855
from getting our stuff out there.

1164
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:24,458
My gut reaction to seeing my own repetitive commentary,

1165
00:50:25,218 --> 00:50:26,079
I would have been embarrassed

1166
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:27,200
and I would have wanted to hide it.

1167
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,821
But that would have been a mistake

1168
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:30,742
because it turned into this positive meme

1169
00:50:30,762 --> 00:50:31,783
that a lot of people love.

1170
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:34,485
So don't be too embarrassed about your stuff

1171
00:50:34,585 --> 00:50:36,006
because you never know what would happen.

1172
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,568
And now we're gonna get into a bonus takeaway,

1173
00:50:39,608 --> 00:50:40,629
which is as a game designer,

1174
00:50:40,649 --> 00:50:42,250
I feel compelled to take what I've observed

1175
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:44,411
and see if it could be applied to games and development.

1176
00:50:45,371 --> 00:50:46,172
So I thought I'd touch on it.

1177
00:50:47,412 --> 00:50:50,534
So while NES Tetris has a max-out as a built-in life goal,

1178
00:50:51,155 --> 00:50:53,056
like a bucket list thing, that's not

1179
00:50:53,076 --> 00:50:55,077
to say that such goals or mechanics can't be devised

1180
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:56,578
by design for games and development.

1181
00:50:57,058 --> 00:50:57,739
It doesn't have to be score.

1182
00:50:57,759 --> 00:50:59,080
It could be something like a perfect run

1183
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,641
or performing a time-based challenge or something like that.

1184
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,504
Achieving grandmaster status in the Tetris Grandmaster games,

1185
00:51:06,124 --> 00:51:07,685
which are the arcade ones by Eureka,

1186
00:51:08,362 --> 00:51:10,644
You have to survive invisible Tetris in the endgame credits,

1187
00:51:10,664 --> 00:51:12,625
and that's an example of an intentionally designed goal

1188
00:51:12,665 --> 00:51:14,566
for players to chase to prove their skill

1189
00:51:14,606 --> 00:51:15,947
in a totally different Tetris game.

1190
00:51:16,588 --> 00:51:19,129
What your game can offer to facilitate the proof of skill

1191
00:51:19,169 --> 00:51:21,591
over time and true mastery is something to think about.

1192
00:51:22,211 --> 00:51:23,572
If you implement skill-based goals,

1193
00:51:23,612 --> 00:51:25,493
it can drive the competitive instinct and discussion,

1194
00:51:25,813 --> 00:51:27,254
which can start a competitive community.

1195
00:51:28,555 --> 00:51:30,196
If your game has mechanics that are unique to it,

1196
00:51:30,416 --> 00:51:31,797
does it have easy-to-understand,

1197
00:51:32,098 --> 00:51:33,518
interesting terminology to back it up?

1198
00:51:34,099 --> 00:51:35,800
How about fun metaphors that work for it?

1199
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,261
Words like Tetris.

1200
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:40,057
Burns, well, drought, and dig,

1201
00:51:40,897 --> 00:51:43,459
help define our gameplay identity and encourage commentary.

1202
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:47,341
And sports celebratory verb terms like touchdown,

1203
00:51:47,681 --> 00:51:53,545
slam dunk, and goal from soccer are all iconic.

1204
00:51:54,206 --> 00:51:55,706
We've got, boom, Tetris for Jeff,

1205
00:51:56,327 --> 00:51:58,208
which is great because it can be an encouragement,

1206
00:51:58,928 --> 00:52:01,950
exclamation, or just a celebration.

1207
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:05,092
So what terms and languages does your game have

1208
00:52:05,152 --> 00:52:06,973
and can it be improved for esports viability?

1209
00:52:09,146 --> 00:52:12,268
Focus on the mechanic of the game that is most fun or unique, and expand on that to

1210
00:52:12,308 --> 00:52:16,130
find what the best eSport context or competitive heart of your game are.

1211
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:21,153
Think of your game as a tool for facilitating competition, even if it might not be designed

1212
00:52:21,193 --> 00:52:22,114
to do that at first.

1213
00:52:22,774 --> 00:52:27,697
Experiment and add things like scores, timers, extra modes, handicaps or new metrics, and

1214
00:52:27,737 --> 00:52:28,938
something competitive may be born.

1215
00:52:29,518 --> 00:52:32,940
If you have no two-player or versus mode, well, what if you put two setups side by side?

1216
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,501
Having a score time

1217
00:52:35,355 --> 00:52:37,756
or time race usually works even in the worst case scenario

1218
00:52:37,796 --> 00:52:39,056
and that's what we did in the 90s

1219
00:52:39,116 --> 00:52:41,758
when we had these big massive console gaming competitions.

1220
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:45,359
So does your game have a finishing moment,

1221
00:52:45,779 --> 00:52:47,040
like a game over or a death?

1222
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:48,861
In the best sporting events and competitions,

1223
00:52:48,881 --> 00:52:50,581
there's huge and impactful moments,

1224
00:52:50,962 --> 00:52:52,342
like a knockout punch for boxing

1225
00:52:52,382 --> 00:52:54,443
is a good relatable analogy for a fighting game.

1226
00:52:55,023 --> 00:52:57,484
In Tetris, for us, it's topping out as our death mechanism.

1227
00:52:58,185 --> 00:53:01,046
So while we could've gone for something

1228
00:53:01,066 --> 00:53:03,087
like a three minute score attack or a first to 25 lines race.

1229
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:06,692
that wouldn't have the impact of impending doom

1230
00:53:06,712 --> 00:53:08,072
that we have in NES Tetris.

1231
00:53:08,573 --> 00:53:10,193
So forcing people to play to the kill screen

1232
00:53:10,213 --> 00:53:12,534
is actually kind of an addicting part of what we do.

1233
00:53:13,074 --> 00:53:15,435
Take advantage of the drama of a finish with commentary

1234
00:53:15,695 --> 00:53:16,995
and build it up however you can.

1235
00:53:18,516 --> 00:53:19,896
Now for any competitive context,

1236
00:53:20,137 --> 00:53:22,157
the game and competition has to facilitate fairness.

1237
00:53:22,717 --> 00:53:25,058
Even for Tetris, having the RNG of the piece

1238
00:53:25,098 --> 00:53:26,199
being the same between players

1239
00:53:26,259 --> 00:53:28,139
is one of the things that made a big difference

1240
00:53:28,179 --> 00:53:30,200
in making the game feel legitimate and competitive.

1241
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,881
Some games implement things like rubber banding.

1242
00:53:33,271 --> 00:53:34,832
Like in a racing game, they artificially cheat

1243
00:53:34,852 --> 00:53:37,192
for the player that's behind to make them catch up,

1244
00:53:37,232 --> 00:53:38,713
to make the games more fun for noobs.

1245
00:53:39,393 --> 00:53:42,374
Mario Party and Mario Kart are some pretty bad offenders.

1246
00:53:43,555 --> 00:53:46,196
But unfairness like that can outright prevent a game

1247
00:53:46,216 --> 00:53:48,157
from being considered viable for eSports.

1248
00:53:49,037 --> 00:53:51,218
So I suggest restricting those elements to beginner modes,

1249
00:53:51,598 --> 00:53:54,459
kids modes, or allow options to control or disable them,

1250
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:56,140
and be transparent with your players.

1251
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:01,842
So this past year, we've gained an unprecedented amount

1252
00:54:01,862 --> 00:54:02,682
of mainstream coverage.

1253
00:54:03,025 --> 00:54:06,227
on everything from Fox News, CTV Canada, to the BBC.

1254
00:54:06,888 --> 00:54:08,869
I think it's the inviting competitive atmosphere

1255
00:54:08,889 --> 00:54:10,790
is what gave us stories like Joseph Saley's.

1256
00:54:11,971 --> 00:54:14,513
As a video game champion myself, starting out as a kid,

1257
00:54:14,913 --> 00:54:16,995
being inspired by TV shows like Starcade

1258
00:54:17,275 --> 00:54:18,696
and other classic gaming competitions,

1259
00:54:19,136 --> 00:54:21,638
that's what allowed me to find my path to success in life.

1260
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:23,900
And now to be involved in the CTWC

1261
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,602
and seeing it inspire a new generation of champions,

1262
00:54:27,282 --> 00:54:28,743
it's really like a dream come true.

1263
00:54:29,244 --> 00:54:30,445
I feel like I've come full circle.

1264
00:54:31,523 --> 00:54:33,304
So if you have a game franchise or IP,

1265
00:54:33,684 --> 00:54:35,585
or are involved in a games community

1266
00:54:35,665 --> 00:54:37,086
and want to grow an eSports presence,

1267
00:54:37,366 --> 00:54:39,707
it's a wonderful opportunity to create something positive

1268
00:54:39,787 --> 00:54:40,467
and life-changing.

1269
00:54:41,707 --> 00:54:45,169
In closing, NWC champion Thor Akerlund

1270
00:54:45,189 --> 00:54:46,449
said something to me that stuck with me.

1271
00:54:46,829 --> 00:54:48,410
He even said it in the Ecstasy of Order movie,

1272
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:50,311
and I'd like to expand upon it a little here.

1273
00:54:50,951 --> 00:54:52,852
Of all games, Tetris is the most like life.

1274
00:54:53,492 --> 00:54:55,313
Death is imminent, life isn't fair,

1275
00:54:55,873 --> 00:54:57,073
but if you can deal with what they give you

1276
00:54:57,113 --> 00:54:59,074
and break through, that's what makes you a winner.

1277
00:54:59,774 --> 00:55:00,915
So here's to a healthy stack.

1278
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:02,832
May your long bar droughts be short,

1279
00:55:03,412 --> 00:55:04,694
and when the pieces fall into place,

1280
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:06,956
may all your VR Tetrises go boom.

1281
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:08,638
Boom, Tetris for you.

1282
00:55:09,899 --> 00:55:11,140
We're always looking for new sponsors,

1283
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,042
so if you have an IP and are interested,

1284
00:55:13,723 --> 00:55:16,426
contact us via email as seen here

1285
00:55:17,407 --> 00:55:19,429
at tetrischampionships at gmail.com.

1286
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,231
And if there's time, I can take questions.

1287
00:55:21,311 --> 00:55:22,673
I think I've got about five minutes left,

1288
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:24,655
so go ahead and approach one of the microphones.

1289
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:40,499
So I was completely unaware of all of this,

1290
00:55:41,419 --> 00:55:43,500
but I believe we worked together at Tengen.

1291
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:44,920
So I'm Franz Lanzinger.

1292
00:55:45,421 --> 00:55:47,882
Oh my gosh, you're the programmer of Klax for Tetris,

1293
00:55:47,982 --> 00:55:49,622
or Klax for NES, right?

1294
00:55:50,242 --> 00:55:50,803
No, no.

1295
00:55:51,463 --> 00:55:51,563
Oh.

1296
00:55:51,643 --> 00:55:52,844
Klax was Dave Arriva.

1297
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:53,504
Oh, okay.

1298
00:55:53,604 --> 00:55:54,784
Yeah, I did Ms. Pac-Man.

1299
00:55:54,984 --> 00:55:55,405
Oh, right.

1300
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:59,326
Ms. Pac-Man, and when you said, boom, Tetris for Jeff,

1301
00:55:59,366 --> 00:56:00,547
I thought you were talking about Jeff Yonan.

1302
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:04,168
Jeff Yonan, no, Jeff Yonan was a big part of my growing up.

1303
00:56:04,268 --> 00:56:05,389
He was an inspiration to me.

1304
00:56:05,409 --> 00:56:06,829
I kept seeing his name on all the shooters

1305
00:56:06,849 --> 00:56:07,750
in the back of EGM,

1306
00:56:08,247 --> 00:56:11,374
I wanted to be just like him and I loved hanging out with him and he designed those mazes in

1307
00:56:11,414 --> 00:56:12,757
Ms. Pac-Man for you, I remember that.

1308
00:56:13,118 --> 00:56:16,566
Yeah, yeah, he did and I think we went to the 1989 championship.

1309
00:56:18,767 --> 00:56:19,628
I mean, remember Jeff...

1310
00:56:19,668 --> 00:56:22,510
I first met Jeff at the 1990 Nintendo World Championship.

1311
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:23,251
Oh, yeah. So he was...

1312
00:56:23,791 --> 00:56:25,973
I think he had a problem with his controller.

1313
00:56:26,033 --> 00:56:26,393
Right.

1314
00:56:26,473 --> 00:56:28,134
He slammed it down on the ground.

1315
00:56:28,154 --> 00:56:29,816
Swung it around above his head.

1316
00:56:30,436 --> 00:56:34,619
Bashed it against the station at the Nintendo World Championships on stage.

1317
00:56:34,679 --> 00:56:37,702
And he had to get escorted off stage and out of the venue.

1318
00:56:38,082 --> 00:56:40,884
And I think he got banned from all Nintendo events after that.

1319
00:56:40,944 --> 00:56:43,186
It's very a shame because he was one of the top players.

1320
00:56:43,226 --> 00:56:43,606
He really...

1321
00:56:43,646 --> 00:56:44,827
Yeah, he's a really good player.

1322
00:56:44,907 --> 00:56:45,768
And I remember...

1323
00:56:46,614 --> 00:56:49,318
That was my first exposure to him, but we became great friends.

1324
00:56:49,438 --> 00:56:51,681
And he's not the Jeff.

1325
00:56:51,721 --> 00:56:53,484
Jeff Moore is the Tetris Jeff.

1326
00:56:53,724 --> 00:56:56,087
But Jeff Yonan holds a very special place in my heart.

1327
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:57,970
And I really hope I get to hang out with him

1328
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:59,272
and work for them some more in the future.

1329
00:56:59,712 --> 00:57:01,595
Anyway, I don't have any questions, but I thought I'd say hi.

1330
00:57:01,976 --> 00:57:02,196
Yeah.

1331
00:57:02,617 --> 00:57:02,997
Hi, Franz.

1332
00:57:03,017 --> 00:57:03,478
Good to see you.

1333
00:57:08,043 --> 00:57:16,566
You touched a little bit on this, I think, but do you have any suggestions for how to make esports approachable to folks that will never be a world championship, but they still want to compete and play and have a good time?

1334
00:57:17,206 --> 00:57:21,628
Okay, so what you can do is you can have side tournaments that aren't the core tournament.

1335
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:25,170
And maybe you don't let the top tier players enter that one.

1336
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:29,311
And like I mentioned, there's like a dance pad battle for Tetris.

1337
00:57:29,651 --> 00:57:35,233
Like, the people who are like super good at Tetris probably aren't going to be the best at that, but the dance players might be really good at it.

1338
00:57:36,109 --> 00:57:39,892
So having a side challenge can get people kind of interested in it.

1339
00:57:40,693 --> 00:57:44,836
You can change the rules a bit, make it easier for folks.

1340
00:57:45,897 --> 00:57:53,042
Maybe having, I wouldn't exactly say amateur rules, but think of something creative, like

1341
00:57:53,062 --> 00:57:57,726
playing the game on a super easy mode and then seeing how far they can scroll the screen

1342
00:57:57,746 --> 00:57:58,787
in one minute or something.

1343
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:00,271
Like something really basic, right?

1344
00:58:00,291 --> 00:58:01,272
Like something that they don't need

1345
00:58:01,792 --> 00:58:04,734
like a super high level of skill to pull off,

1346
00:58:04,994 --> 00:58:08,297
but it might just be interesting to see what comes of it.

1347
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:09,218
That's great, thank you.

1348
00:58:14,601 --> 00:58:15,502
Any other questions?

1349
00:58:16,363 --> 00:58:17,563
Anyone just wanna come up

1350
00:58:17,603 --> 00:58:19,245
and make me say boom Tetris for them?

1351
00:58:19,265 --> 00:58:25,449
Okay, well, thanks for coming to my talk.

1352
00:58:25,893 --> 00:58:29,456
session. I know that there was Devil May Cry and some other stuff going on.

1353
00:58:30,217 --> 00:58:35,141
Thanks for coming to Tetris. We're going to continue doing our event every year and

1354
00:58:35,701 --> 00:58:42,267
hopefully we'll grow and inspire more kids to stay off of Fortnite and stay off the streets and

1355
00:58:43,127 --> 00:58:46,430
play some competitive Tetris. So boom, Tetris for you and Tetris for GDC.
