1
00:00:04,332 --> 00:00:04,672
Hello.

2
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:06,032
Can everyone hear me?

3
00:00:06,212 --> 00:00:06,732
Everyone hear me?

4
00:00:08,553 --> 00:00:09,293
Some portion of people.

5
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:09,653
Oh, wow.

6
00:00:09,853 --> 00:00:10,073
Hi.

7
00:00:10,673 --> 00:00:10,913
Hi.

8
00:00:11,493 --> 00:00:11,833
Welcome.

9
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:12,853
Welcome.

10
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:14,374
Hi, Steve.

11
00:00:17,054 --> 00:00:17,434
Excuse me.

12
00:00:19,475 --> 00:00:22,055
Are you guys ready to rock out about choice architecture?

13
00:00:22,076 --> 00:00:23,556
Yeah!

14
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:26,256
Wow, it's a very exciting topic.

15
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,281
Welcome. The name of this talk is really dumb and I apologize.

16
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:34,082
It's Do Say the Right Thing.

17
00:00:34,622 --> 00:00:36,363
Choice architecture, player expression,

18
00:00:37,223 --> 00:00:38,964
and narrative design in Fallout New Vegas.

19
00:00:40,004 --> 00:00:41,625
I'm going to be talking a lot about Fallout New Vegas,

20
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:42,886
but also a lot of other things.

21
00:00:43,306 --> 00:00:44,146
My name is Josh Sawyer.

22
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,987
I'm a project director with Obsidian Entertainment.

23
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:48,048
Before we start, there are a few things

24
00:00:48,308 --> 00:00:50,329
that GDC would like me to go over for you all.

25
00:00:50,949 --> 00:00:51,669
One, please, uh...

26
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:57,308
turn off your cell phones or set them to vibrate, or telepathic link, or whatever, you know,

27
00:00:57,328 --> 00:01:01,130
sort of cool features are coming out these days. Basically just turn the ringer off.

28
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,713
Also, you should be receiving an evaluation form via email. Please fill it out because

29
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:12,617
it helps GDC evaluate things and do cool, awesome stuff. Awesome. Let us start.

30
00:01:15,298 --> 00:01:16,959
So just a little bit of background.

31
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:22,832
I'm a project director at Obsidian Entertainment and a lead designer.

32
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:24,493
My background is in design.

33
00:01:25,454 --> 00:01:30,558
I started design at Black Isle Studios back in the late 90s on the Icewind Dale series.

34
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:35,022
I am primarily a system designer and adapter of systems.

35
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:39,466
I've worked on a lot of Dungeons & Dragons games, so I've had to do a lot of work adapting

36
00:01:39,906 --> 00:01:40,527
rule systems.

37
00:01:41,507 --> 00:01:44,250
Even though I do writing, my job is not primarily doing writing.

38
00:01:44,892 --> 00:01:46,933
I work a lot on the mechanics surrounding writing,

39
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,254
which is why I wanted to give this talk.

40
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:50,216
I'll get a little bit into the sort of difference

41
00:01:50,256 --> 00:01:52,178
between the prose and the choice architecture,

42
00:01:52,198 --> 00:01:54,460
but I focus primarily on system mechanics.

43
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,522
My role on Fallout New Vegas was as the lead designer,

44
00:01:57,582 --> 00:01:59,123
system designer, and project director.

45
00:01:59,864 --> 00:02:01,465
Just to sort of let it be known,

46
00:02:01,485 --> 00:02:03,267
there were actually a number of people that contributed

47
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:04,748
to the dialogue on Fallout New Vegas.

48
00:02:05,128 --> 00:02:07,050
John Gonzales was actually our creative director,

49
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:07,991
and he wrote the story.

50
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,393
We had a lot of great writers on the project

51
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:11,634
that all contributed to making it

52
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,455
a very open narrative experience.

53
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:19,934
I am a tabletop RPG player. I have been a tabletop RPG player for a very, very long time.

54
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,316
I love playing computer role-playing games,

55
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:25,678
but I consider myself to be a fairly broad-spectrum gamer now.

56
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:28,100
I used to be very focused on PC RPGs,

57
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,522
but now I play lots of console games, action games, racing games, all sorts of stuff.

58
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:32,603
So that's my background.

59
00:02:38,947 --> 00:02:39,728
Alright, hold on.

60
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:42,790
I've already screwed up this presentation. This is awesome.

61
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:54,630
Yes. Okay. So this talk is really about branching dialogue and the sort of challenges that come up with branching dialogue.

62
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,812
Branching dialogue is not necessary. It kind of goes without saying, but I thought it needed to be addressed.

63
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:02,394
It's not necessary or even desirable for lots of games.

64
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:05,235
There are a lot of different styles of dialogue that you can approach in a game.

65
00:03:05,755 --> 00:03:09,437
These are the three sort of broad categories that I identified when I was preparing this talk.

66
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:11,458
The first is linear or cinematic.

67
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,120
arguably the most common that you'll see in games, especially nowadays.

68
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:18,682
Sort of exemplified by games like the Uncharted series.

69
00:03:19,422 --> 00:03:21,804
The story is written, the characters are established,

70
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:24,765
you aren't really, the player doesn't really have agency in how those

71
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:27,347
characters interact with each other or how the story unfolds.

72
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,369
It's a cinematic experience, writing's great, looks awesome,

73
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:33,010
and the focus is really on the gameplay and you're just,

74
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,751
the cinematic storytelling and the dialogue

75
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:37,773
is there to serve a narrative function, it's not about player agency.

76
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:39,914
Totally valid, cool thing to do.

77
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:45,770
Another way of approaching dialogue is what I call keyword or subject dialogue.

78
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,451
This is also not really about player agency.

79
00:03:48,471 --> 00:03:51,032
This isn't about saying to the player, you get to shape the story.

80
00:03:51,452 --> 00:03:53,993
It's about saying to the player, hey, do you want to learn more about this setting?

81
00:03:54,013 --> 00:03:55,253
Do you want to learn more about this world?

82
00:03:55,574 --> 00:03:57,036
Do you want to trigger this quest now?

83
00:03:57,476 --> 00:04:02,162
And so a game like the Diablo series uses this where you have a list of things to talk

84
00:04:02,222 --> 00:04:06,107
about and the player is really just saying like, tell me about this thing, tell me about

85
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:07,289
this thing, tell me about this thing.

86
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,915
So again, it's not about granting player agency, it's really about allowing the player to make

87
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:14,278
a choice as to when they want to receive any bit of narrative content.

88
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,784
What this talk is about, though, is about branching trees.

89
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:23,326
This is dialogue where you have menus of options presented in a variety of ways,

90
00:04:23,746 --> 00:04:28,388
where the dialogue can flow, branch out, branch out even more, circle back on itself.

91
00:04:29,048 --> 00:04:32,189
Ideally, it's producing gameplay changes, it's producing story changes.

92
00:04:34,002 --> 00:04:36,123
It's not a whole lot of companies necessarily do this.

93
00:04:36,263 --> 00:04:37,184
I'm glad so many of you came.

94
00:04:37,224 --> 00:04:38,664
I wasn't sure how broad the appeal would be.

95
00:04:39,104 --> 00:04:41,625
But obviously companies like Bioware sell it at Black Isle.

96
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:43,066
We did it back at Black Isle.

97
00:04:43,126 --> 00:04:44,586
We continue to do it at Obsidian.

98
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:45,927
Bethesda also does it.

99
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:48,668
I'm sure there are other companies that do it as well.

100
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:52,710
But it's a tricky thing, and that's why I'm having this talk.

101
00:04:55,182 --> 00:04:57,787
So someone might ask, why even use branching trees?

102
00:04:57,827 --> 00:04:58,568
What's the advantage?

103
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,373
You can get all sorts of cool cinematic stuff and cool

104
00:05:01,393 --> 00:05:03,036
character development with good voice acting and

105
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:04,479
everything in a purely cinematic view.

106
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:05,902
Why even use branching trees?

107
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:07,885
There are a few very good reasons for this.

108
00:05:09,168 --> 00:05:11,871
First is, you get to grant story agency to the player.

109
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:13,512
You get to say to the player, hey, you know what?

110
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:16,355
You have some role in defining where the story goes

111
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:17,557
and how it unfolds.

112
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,318
It's very important for a lot of people,

113
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,860
especially in role-playing games.

114
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:24,164
For a lot of people who came from a tabletop

115
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:25,345
or pen and paper background,

116
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:27,127
they really, really enjoy the ability

117
00:05:27,147 --> 00:05:29,389
to screw with the story in some ways and make it their own.

118
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:34,379
You also grant character agency, and I want to differentiate that from story agency.

119
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:39,881
You're not just changing the story, but you have the ability to express what type of person your character is.

120
00:05:40,462 --> 00:05:46,224
So if you're a jackass, or you're a really cool guy, or you want to smooch some girl or something, whatever,

121
00:05:46,644 --> 00:05:50,746
that's why we build that in there, to allow you to express the type of character you are.

122
00:05:50,786 --> 00:05:52,907
Not just how the story goes, but how you make it unfold.

123
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:57,828
Also, it forces you to make tactical and strategic choices.

124
00:05:58,468 --> 00:06:03,169
Again, this is sort of ideally, this is what I'm going towards in the talk, but good dialogue

125
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:07,230
is gameplay, and the player should look at it as a series of choices that they're making,

126
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,131
short-term choices and long-term choices.

127
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:14,732
And when it's done very well, the player feels very engaged, they're paying attention, they

128
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:19,733
pause to think about what they want to do, they feel satisfaction and the sting of making

129
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:23,014
sacrifices along the way, and that produces great gameplay through dialogue.

130
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,936
and also it produces reactive narrative content.

131
00:06:26,276 --> 00:06:28,778
This can take place outside of the dialogue itself.

132
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:31,860
This can be people giving what we call bark strings in the world.

133
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,321
Someone saying like,

134
00:06:32,341 --> 00:06:35,363
Hey man, thanks for, you know, blowing up our town, you asshole, or whatever.

135
00:06:35,383 --> 00:06:38,325
You know, like, it's that, all that sort of rich world reactivity

136
00:06:38,505 --> 00:06:39,646
that doesn't really need to be deep.

137
00:06:40,227 --> 00:06:42,308
It just needs to be actually more widespread and shallow,

138
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:45,050
but it makes the player feel that the world pays attention

139
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,431
to the things that he or she does.

140
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:52,440
So this talk is not about writing prose.

141
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,760
There are writers' roundtables.

142
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,560
Actually, one's going on right now, strangely enough.

143
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:57,941
There are great writers' roundtables that are going on.

144
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:01,382
Obviously, Austin GDC has a bunch of cool writer stuff going on.

145
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:05,943
This isn't really about prose and writing good dialogue

146
00:07:06,003 --> 00:07:07,343
from the perspective of aesthetics.

147
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:09,263
It's about choices.

148
00:07:10,104 --> 00:07:12,324
The reason why I want to start with choice architecture

149
00:07:12,404 --> 00:07:15,585
is because it should come under and before prose.

150
00:07:16,685 --> 00:07:18,205
Choices inform the prose that you write.

151
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:20,848
but choices present problems on their own.

152
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:22,950
A lot of problems, and they need to be thought through.

153
00:07:23,731 --> 00:07:27,195
And choice is the reason to have branching dialogue in the first place,

154
00:07:27,596 --> 00:07:29,959
so it should be the place where we start to think about

155
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:31,460
what we're doing and how we want to do it.

156
00:07:33,423 --> 00:07:36,666
So, I couldn't quite pinpoint the exact...

157
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:41,609
time and place where sort of branching narrative became a thing.

158
00:07:41,989 --> 00:07:45,631
But one of the common things that came up was with an author, Jorge Luis Borges,

159
00:07:46,152 --> 00:07:48,453
and he wrote a book called The Garden of Forking Paths.

160
00:07:49,313 --> 00:07:51,955
And this was pretty radical at the time because

161
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:54,957
the story could be read in a lot of different ways,

162
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:57,498
and the reader would arrive at different conclusions

163
00:07:57,538 --> 00:07:59,139
about what the narrative was and where it went.

164
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,182
And someone writing a few years ago about this

165
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,521
I have this cool quote that actually when I can see it on my screen I'll read out to you.

166
00:08:09,762 --> 00:08:14,364
Borges confronts us with the pullulating moment when we become aware of all the possible choices

167
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:19,126
we might make, all the ways in which we might intersect one another for good or evil.

168
00:08:19,806 --> 00:08:23,347
His imagined garden of forking paths is both a book and a landscape,

169
00:08:23,848 --> 00:08:28,069
a book that has the shape of a labyrinth that folds back upon itself in infinite regression.

170
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,772
This is the definition of sort of the possibility space for the player.

171
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:35,756
When we empower the player to make choices and then reward them for making choices,

172
00:08:35,796 --> 00:08:38,938
they become aware of the power they have in the story and they start to embrace it.

173
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:43,903
If we consistently reward that, they feel like they have a very strong role as a player

174
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:47,966
in determining the outcome and they engage with the story much more than if they're just watching it,

175
00:08:48,006 --> 00:08:50,368
because they realize they're an active participant in it.

176
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:54,391
Jeez Louise.

177
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:00,687
This is when I actually started caring about it.

178
00:09:00,988 --> 00:09:04,930
Strangely enough, I was not reading Borges when I was five years old.

179
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:10,813
I was reading The Cave of Time, which is my favorite of the Choose Your Own Adventure series.

180
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,935
I'm curious, how many people have read Choose Your Own Adventure books?

181
00:09:14,575 --> 00:09:14,955
Yeah!

182
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:16,796
Those are a great series of books.

183
00:09:17,277 --> 00:09:18,677
Awesome. Yes. Yes.

184
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:24,698
So, choose-your-own-adventure books are, they're great, fantastic stuff.

185
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,879
Every book is a different sort of style book or genre of book,

186
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,880
but they all have that idea of branching narrative.

187
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,901
However, if you were even a remotely smart kid,

188
00:09:34,761 --> 00:09:36,702
what you started to do after you read a few of these books

189
00:09:36,762 --> 00:09:40,983
was you start to put your finger in the page before you made a choice.

190
00:09:42,325 --> 00:09:46,207
And just to draw a parallel, this is not really that different from abusing a save-load mechanic.

191
00:09:47,727 --> 00:09:50,708
Which is actually a big point of some of the things I come to later.

192
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:54,089
So, choose your own adventure books are the start of this, but even they have underlying

193
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:57,570
problems that still persist now in branching dialogue and role-playing games.

194
00:09:59,235 --> 00:10:03,098
Then later on, I really got into role-playing games, tabletop role-playing games.

195
00:10:03,678 --> 00:10:07,081
And I played with a lot of different DMs, and I was the DM, and a lot of different players.

196
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:10,323
And the stuff that I enjoyed the most, and the stuff my players seemed to enjoy the most,

197
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:15,046
is when the story was constructed in such a way that the players could fuck it up.

198
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:18,108
Basically, they could screw with it, and they could push it, and they could pull it.

199
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:21,649
they could smack the quest giver and throw him down a well,

200
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:24,410
and the story could keep working, and then it rolled with it,

201
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,810
and that was so satisfying to them.

202
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,470
And often there were consequences for doing that sort of stuff,

203
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:31,291
but they felt very empowered in that environment,

204
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:32,331
especially because that was just,

205
00:10:32,751 --> 00:10:34,552
it's up to the people there and their imagination.

206
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,632
So that feeling can be hard to emulate in a computer environment,

207
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:40,113
but that's what, ideally, we try to do.

208
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:42,133
And so this had a lasting effect on me.

209
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:43,314
I played tons of these games,

210
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:45,994
and the most satisfying times were the ones where I was able to do that.

211
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:52,141
Dialogue trees and RPGs, my first experience with it was with the original Fallout.

212
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:57,625
Tim Cain gave a great post-mortem this morning on Fallout.

213
00:10:58,614 --> 00:11:02,217
I was in college when Fallout came out, and I was just enthralled with it.

214
00:11:02,257 --> 00:11:02,957
I thought it was great.

215
00:11:03,798 --> 00:11:05,039
I loved how you could make choices.

216
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:08,521
You could be an evil character, you could be a sort of neutral character, you could

217
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:12,684
do all sorts of different stuff, and the game didn't... it wasn't like a grand karmic wheel

218
00:11:12,724 --> 00:11:14,946
was there to smash you in the face after you made a bad choice.

219
00:11:15,246 --> 00:11:19,009
People reacted to the bad things that you did, but the game itself did not punish you.

220
00:11:19,229 --> 00:11:21,531
The designer did not punish you for playing a certain way.

221
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:27,644
Also, when I first came to Black Isle, my first job there was as a webmaster on the

222
00:11:27,684 --> 00:11:30,227
web team, and I made the Planescape Torment website.

223
00:11:30,247 --> 00:11:34,692
I was working with the development team, and obviously Torment is very, very widely regarded

224
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:40,218
as a great game with amazing choice and consequence, huge amount of dialogue, lots of reactivity.

225
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,863
And so that had an impression on me because when I came into that environment,

226
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,488
I saw these guys that were just busting ass to give them, you know,

227
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:50,710
all this choice and consequence to the player.

228
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:53,554
So that was the environment that I came into when I came to Black Isle.

229
00:11:55,796 --> 00:11:57,639
So, dialogue trees today.

230
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:00,923
I had to get that ass shot in there.

231
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:01,443
Had to.

232
00:12:03,402 --> 00:12:04,763
Haven't seen enough of Mass Effect 3.

233
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,545
There might be a more up-to-date Ashot

234
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:09,346
that I could have put in there, but I didn't have time.

235
00:12:09,926 --> 00:12:12,048
So dialogue trees and CRPGs today,

236
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:15,310
they're not really that different in a lot of ways.

237
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,591
They're presented different.

238
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:17,872
The aesthetics are a lot different.

239
00:12:18,652 --> 00:12:21,516
but kind of fundamentally under the hood how they work,

240
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:22,858
they haven't changed a whole lot.

241
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:25,501
So the changes have been primarily aesthetic,

242
00:12:25,902 --> 00:12:28,986
not really structural, but there are persistent flaws,

243
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,491
and to me, in my mind, that sort of suggests

244
00:12:32,511 --> 00:12:34,533
a lack of analysis to this point in time.

245
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:38,058
I've been thinking about this a lot over the past few games I've been working on.

246
00:12:39,479 --> 00:12:42,723
And it's been difficult because I've been writing in this mode and this style for so long.

247
00:12:43,204 --> 00:12:47,649
But I made this talk because I wanted to figure out, like, what the hell are we still doing wrong?

248
00:12:47,689 --> 00:12:50,653
Like, this is the way I want to write dialogues, but there's got to be some...

249
00:12:50,813 --> 00:12:53,316
there are some underlying flaws here that I need to dig at and get out.

250
00:12:55,438 --> 00:12:56,179
We did it also.

251
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:00,323
It's just, it's, yeah, it's not just, you know,

252
00:13:00,424 --> 00:13:01,765
other companies that are doing it.

253
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:03,487
And hopefully I will provide more examples

254
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:05,630
of us screwing up in this talk than other companies,

255
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,591
although I will give examples

256
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:07,532
of other companies screwing up.

257
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:11,056
On New Vegas, our writers did a great job.

258
00:13:11,096 --> 00:13:12,237
John Gonzales did a great job.

259
00:13:12,689 --> 00:13:13,830
all the writers did a great job.

260
00:13:15,092 --> 00:13:17,454
Worked very fast using an engine we weren't familiar with,

261
00:13:18,996 --> 00:13:20,777
but there were certain structural flaws to it,

262
00:13:21,158 --> 00:13:23,600
mechanical things that I saw and other people saw,

263
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,822
and they're kind of like, this still kind of feels stinky.

264
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:27,884
There's got to be a better way to handle this.

265
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:33,916
So the core problem for me is about choice conflict.

266
00:13:35,337 --> 00:13:41,602
What I mean by choice conflict is when the player's goals and the goals of the player

267
00:13:41,742 --> 00:13:47,447
as a game-wise conflict with the goals of the character as a player.

268
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,531
you know, an expression of the player.

269
00:13:49,551 --> 00:13:52,514
So the player has a character who's like a sassy jackass or whatever.

270
00:13:53,235 --> 00:13:54,416
The player wants to get a thing.

271
00:13:54,536 --> 00:13:57,699
If they play their character as a sassy jackass, they can't get the thing.

272
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:00,581
So when we do that as designers, we're saying,

273
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:02,723
your character concept is invalid for this game.

274
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:07,063
That's an extreme example, but that's really the root of the issue,

275
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,325
is that doing or saying the right thing,

276
00:14:10,405 --> 00:14:12,206
meaning the thing that is actually going to progress the game

277
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:13,347
in the most favorable way,

278
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,849
conflicts with the idea of a right character.

279
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:20,051
The two examples I've listed here are Deus Ex's social boss battles,

280
00:14:20,452 --> 00:14:20,592
which

281
00:14:20,612 --> 00:14:21,072
are the most important.

282
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:25,006
No offense. I actually thought Deus Ex Human Revolution was a fantastic game.

283
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:29,187
I liked how they presented their conversations, but the conversations felt like puzzles.

284
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:31,428
They didn't feel like things that grant player agency.

285
00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:34,128
Because if you choose to play a character in a certain way in that conversation,

286
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:35,849
you will lose the conversation.

287
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:40,310
However, similarly, in Fallout New Vegas, we have dialogue skills like speech and barter.

288
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:44,192
We also have dialogue perks, and they become you-win-the-conversation choices.

289
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:48,253
And the choice here talking with, um, I can't remember that guy's name, Santiago?

290
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:49,426
I think.

291
00:14:49,927 --> 00:14:52,891
When you're talking to Santiago, if you pick anything other than the speech option, you're

292
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:54,913
basically intentionally handicapping yourself.

293
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,978
So if you want to roleplay a certain way, we're essentially saying, okay, thanks for

294
00:14:59,018 --> 00:15:02,403
being a dummy, you are going to lose out in this situation.

295
00:15:03,144 --> 00:15:07,629
So to repeat this, this is the main subject of this talk that I screwed up yet again.

296
00:15:09,105 --> 00:15:12,127
is that doing, or saying, the right thing

297
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:15,389
to get a gameplay advantage, or the gameplay advantage

298
00:15:15,409 --> 00:15:16,570
to move it forward the way you want to,

299
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,391
conflicts with being the right character.

300
00:15:18,872 --> 00:15:19,952
And you may be saying,

301
00:15:20,693 --> 00:15:23,415
well, Sassy Man, what's the right character?

302
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:26,457
That's your voice in my head, by the way.

303
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:30,780
The answer is, any character that falls

304
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,501
within our supported range of expression,

305
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:34,763
for the player, that's a right character.

306
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:38,195
If we allow you to play out a certain fantasy,

307
00:15:38,556 --> 00:15:39,496
that's a right character.

308
00:15:40,196 --> 00:15:41,677
Some of this has to do with consistency.

309
00:15:41,777 --> 00:15:43,838
If we consistently reinforce something for the player

310
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:45,679
and then pull the rug out from under him or her,

311
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:46,860
bad news.

312
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,141
So when we look at what's a valid character,

313
00:15:49,201 --> 00:15:51,682
we define that expression range and we have to support it.

314
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,743
If we don't, we're letting the player down.

315
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:56,204
We're saying, yeah, we kind of allow you to play this,

316
00:15:56,224 --> 00:15:56,845
but not really.

317
00:15:56,945 --> 00:15:59,586
It's mostly cosmetic and sometimes you'll get something

318
00:15:59,606 --> 00:16:01,087
out of it, but most of the time you're gonna get screwed.

319
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:01,867
That's the problem.

320
00:16:03,268 --> 00:16:03,828
It's a game.

321
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,081
It's not a puzzle.

322
00:16:08,242 --> 00:16:09,683
Puzzles are not really games.

323
00:16:10,104 --> 00:16:11,685
There are right answers and wrong answers.

324
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:14,047
It is not a movie.

325
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,769
It is not something you sort of sit back and watch.

326
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,650
And it is not a book.

327
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,891
It is not just for reading.

328
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:20,353
You're making choices to go through it.

329
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:22,855
It's a game.

330
00:16:23,055 --> 00:16:25,457
And if we embrace dialogue as gameplay and not things that

331
00:16:25,497 --> 00:16:28,380
are sort of ancillary to the game and treat it as like,

332
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,201
well, yeah, there's the game, and then there's the story.

333
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:33,229
If you're doing branching dialogue, I think it's important that—

334
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,212
and again, you don't have to do branching dialogue.

335
00:16:35,232 --> 00:16:36,694
It's not important for all games.

336
00:16:37,234 --> 00:16:39,517
But if you're going to do that, then you should do it as well as you can,

337
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:41,019
and you should incorporate it into the gameplay.

338
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:44,043
So my assertion here is that

339
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:48,108
if you plan well, you can avoid choice conflict.

340
00:16:49,281 --> 00:16:53,104
when all the ways that you can go through the game are considered validated ways

341
00:16:53,884 --> 00:16:58,467
and you give a clear response and reactivity spectrum to the player, meaning

342
00:16:59,088 --> 00:17:01,869
you make a choice, you get this feedback, you make this choice, you get this feedback.

343
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,153
When that happens, the player benefits and the character roles align.

344
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:08,214
There is not a conflict.

345
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:09,375
Because you've already planned out,

346
00:17:09,675 --> 00:17:11,536
hey, if a player wants to be a crazy jackass,

347
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:15,063
they're going to make these sacrifices, but they're going to get this out of it,

348
00:17:15,183 --> 00:17:16,284
and they're going to feel good about it.

349
00:17:16,605 --> 00:17:18,506
But it takes planning. You can't just, like,

350
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:21,809
decide to do it. It doesn't happen spontaneously.

351
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:27,174
You have to look at three things when you're planning this stuff out.

352
00:17:27,654 --> 00:17:30,036
The types of choices you want to allow the player to make.

353
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,551
the range of player and character expression.

354
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:36,312
This is sort of like, well, what sort of characters

355
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:37,853
are actually valid within this game?

356
00:17:38,313 --> 00:17:42,454
As an example, in Fallout 1, you could kill kids.

357
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:44,956
Wowee.

358
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:48,877
In Fallout 2, you could marry somebody

359
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:51,678
and then basically sell them as a, you know,

360
00:17:51,718 --> 00:17:52,699
into like, porndom.

361
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:55,280
So that's like a range of expression that says like,

362
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,181
okay, the goalposts are really far apart here.

363
00:17:58,141 --> 00:17:59,542
So once you've sort of established that,

364
00:17:59,882 --> 00:18:00,542
that's what you're going for.

365
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:02,847
And then finally, your narrative goals.

366
00:18:03,307 --> 00:18:05,688
You as designers, you also have to accomplish certain things.

367
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,149
You have to communicate certain things to the players, and those can be in conflict

368
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:10,249
with what the player wants to do.

369
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,291
If you say, hey player, you can be a sassy jackass, but if you do that you're going to

370
00:18:14,311 --> 00:18:19,412
miss all this critical information for playing the game, that's, that kind of sucks.

371
00:18:20,793 --> 00:18:23,794
So here's my systemic approach to doing this.

372
00:18:24,534 --> 00:18:27,775
Consider the types of choices that you're going to make.

373
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:29,596
The range of player and character expression.

374
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:33,490
establish the narrative goals that you have for the game that you need to communicate,

375
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:37,332
then get some perspective on how these three things work together,

376
00:18:37,893 --> 00:18:40,034
then you write your prose.

377
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,075
And again, this is not about prose.

378
00:18:42,175 --> 00:18:47,879
That's a separate sort of subject that can be a rich tapestry of interesting things.

379
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,420
Not here, though.

380
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:51,321
And then everyone goes,

381
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,863
My god, your game is so amazing.

382
00:18:54,003 --> 00:18:54,423
Thank you.

383
00:18:55,024 --> 00:18:57,165
I got to play exactly the character I wanted or the best.

384
00:18:58,912 --> 00:19:01,592
So step one is considering the types of choices you can make.

385
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:06,020
So you want to provide tactical choices to the player.

386
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,141
Tactical choices are what I would call node-by-node

387
00:19:08,181 --> 00:19:08,581
choices.

388
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,962
In the conversation, every node where

389
00:19:10,982 --> 00:19:12,122
you're allowed to make a choice, there

390
00:19:12,142 --> 00:19:13,663
should be some sort of tactical decision there.

391
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,544
Those are immediate reactions.

392
00:19:15,924 --> 00:19:16,824
Strategic choices.

393
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:18,225
This is long-term planning.

394
00:19:18,285 --> 00:19:21,106
This is not necessarily about, I'm going to say this,

395
00:19:21,146 --> 00:19:22,266
and this guy is going to get mad at me,

396
00:19:22,306 --> 00:19:24,007
and then this girl is going to give me a kiss.

397
00:19:24,387 --> 00:19:27,489
It's about, you're sort of like building reputations

398
00:19:27,529 --> 00:19:29,850
with people, indirect reputation mechanics, things like that.

399
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:32,532
You want to forecast consequences.

400
00:19:33,092 --> 00:19:35,793
There's actually a pretty cool anecdote

401
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:38,634
that Tim Cain brought up in the Q&A session of Fallout 1,

402
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:41,556
which is about the ending of Junktown in Fallout 1.

403
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:44,417
So Junktown, initially the endings were,

404
00:19:44,737 --> 00:19:47,178
if you put Killian Darkwater, who's like the good guy,

405
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:49,499
in power, then Junktown gets screwed.

406
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:52,060
And if you put Gizmo, who's the scumbag in charge,

407
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,641
Junktown actually does very well.

408
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:56,542
But the consequences of that weren't really forecast.

409
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,283
It was kind of just a reversal.

410
00:19:58,443 --> 00:20:00,404
It just said like, ha ha, actually Killian sucks.

411
00:20:01,104 --> 00:20:04,006
And because those consequences weren't forecast,

412
00:20:04,146 --> 00:20:05,567
it felt weird to a lot of people,

413
00:20:05,607 --> 00:20:07,087
even though it was arguably more interesting.

414
00:20:08,048 --> 00:20:10,249
And then finally, you have to validate all options

415
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:12,890
to avoid the perception of win or loss,

416
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,711
the perception of, well, I guess I just made

417
00:20:14,751 --> 00:20:16,872
the wrong choice, I'm playing the wrong sort of character,

418
00:20:16,893 --> 00:20:18,713
I should go back and try to get something else out of it.

419
00:20:20,835 --> 00:20:22,435
So some words on choice architecture.

420
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,797
Hopefully I won't screw this up yet another time

421
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,057
as I go to look at it.

422
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:30,139
So I've been reading an interesting book by two,

423
00:20:31,788 --> 00:20:35,329
professors from the University of Chicago called Nudge.

424
00:20:35,889 --> 00:20:37,889
And it's about choice architecture and a lot of other things.

425
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:41,250
And there's this interesting quote that one of the authors gave at a convention

426
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,750
about choice architecture.

427
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,031
So choice architects must choose something.

428
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,131
You have to meddle.

429
00:20:47,571 --> 00:20:49,732
For example, you can't design a neutral building.

430
00:20:50,032 --> 00:20:50,992
There is no such thing.

431
00:20:51,392 --> 00:20:53,873
A building must have doors, elevators, restrooms.

432
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:56,833
All of these details influence choices people make.

433
00:20:58,214 --> 00:21:03,275
There is nothing neutral about putting an attack reply at the top of a dialogue tree structure.

434
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:07,296
There is nothing neutral about putting a goodbye reply at the end of the dialogue tree structure.

435
00:21:07,737 --> 00:21:09,317
These are consistent choices that you make.

436
00:21:09,557 --> 00:21:12,138
How you lay these things out, how you present them to the player,

437
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:15,219
that has a huge impact on how they perceive them and how they make choices.

438
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:18,531
In Obsidian games, Forever, and Black Isle games,

439
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:21,754
usually the default option for everything is always the top one,

440
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:24,136
because we find that people tend to just gravitate there.

441
00:21:24,536 --> 00:21:25,757
If you put an attack node there,

442
00:21:26,698 --> 00:21:27,519
people get mad,

443
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,180
because they start going,

444
00:21:29,341 --> 00:21:30,161
one, one, one,

445
00:21:30,201 --> 00:21:31,542
goddammit, why am I in combat?

446
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,704
So it matters.

447
00:21:33,764 --> 00:21:34,565
That goes back to this idea,

448
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,627
you really do have to think about how you lay these things out.

449
00:21:38,449 --> 00:21:40,811
Oh my god, yet again, what am I doing?

450
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:43,913
How do I use PowerPoint?

451
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:47,929
So node-by-node choices, just to go back to this.

452
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:50,671
Node-by-node choices are, again, you get to a point in dialogue,

453
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:52,412
the guy says, yeah, what are you going to do about it, buddy?

454
00:21:53,052 --> 00:21:54,033
And then you have three options.

455
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:55,374
You can say, well, I'm sorry.

456
00:21:55,434 --> 00:21:55,995
Let's work it out.

457
00:21:56,035 --> 00:21:57,015
I'm a diplomatic guy.

458
00:21:57,236 --> 00:21:58,276
Or I hate your guts.

459
00:21:58,296 --> 00:21:59,157
I'm going to snap you in the face.

460
00:22:00,418 --> 00:22:01,259
That's a tactical choice.

461
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,780
There's going to be immediate reactivity and feedback

462
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:04,061
to that.

463
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:05,862
So that's tactical choice.

464
00:22:05,902 --> 00:22:06,603
It's short term.

465
00:22:07,003 --> 00:22:08,804
These are things, ideally, that happen quite a bit

466
00:22:08,824 --> 00:22:09,565
in conversation.

467
00:22:10,105 --> 00:22:11,847
They usually require a lot of scripting.

468
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:14,148
So they can't happen all over the place.

469
00:22:14,609 --> 00:22:16,631
But these are the things that people really react to.

470
00:22:16,691 --> 00:22:19,053
Where, you know, was the conversation in Mass Effect 1

471
00:22:19,413 --> 00:22:22,096
where the reporter's saying something to Shepard

472
00:22:22,136 --> 00:22:25,038
and he's just like, you know, punches her in the face.

473
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:25,939
You know, people are like,

474
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,381
oh man, a million YouTube videos,

475
00:22:27,421 --> 00:22:28,381
I'm the first guy to post this.

476
00:22:29,823 --> 00:22:30,744
It's a tactical choice.

477
00:22:32,265 --> 00:22:32,625
Very cool.

478
00:22:34,347 --> 00:22:35,948
There are also strategic choices to make, though.

479
00:22:36,629 --> 00:22:41,310
One thing I identified in here that works generally very well for this are what I just made up this term

480
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,051
indirect reaction systems these would be things like karma or

481
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:52,913
Reputation or loyalty or whatever you don't get necessarily an immediate feedback out of it

482
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:58,034
But you're putting you're putting pennies in the the rainy day event reactivity fund

483
00:22:58,554 --> 00:23:02,855
So, you know you kind of sass someone and you know NCR gets a little grumpy with you and that

484
00:23:03,195 --> 00:23:05,157
you know, you get points in the negative pool,

485
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:06,959
and then you do some stuff for Caesar's Legion,

486
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:08,380
and then you get points in the happy pool,

487
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:09,841
and then eventually, you know,

488
00:23:10,302 --> 00:23:11,783
some NTR ranger comes up to you and says,

489
00:23:11,803 --> 00:23:13,725
you're gonna fucking die, bro, and shoots you.

490
00:23:14,846 --> 00:23:17,569
So it's a long-term outcome, it's a strategic decision.

491
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:19,511
It's not about having a big scripted reaction,

492
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:21,313
it's about a little reaction that builds up over time.

493
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:24,870
Forecasting consequences.

494
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,253
So, you know, I gave that example of the choice from Fallout 1.

495
00:23:29,753 --> 00:23:31,735
So the idea is that you want to intrigue the player.

496
00:23:32,235 --> 00:23:33,936
You don't need to spell everything out,

497
00:23:33,976 --> 00:23:36,118
but you kind of have to forecast what's going to happen.

498
00:23:36,658 --> 00:23:37,839
In a writers' roundtable yesterday,

499
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,240
one of the guys gave an example of,

500
00:23:39,581 --> 00:23:40,962
I don't actually know what game he was talking about,

501
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:43,063
but he said he picked a line that seemed like

502
00:23:43,404 --> 00:23:45,505
kind of aggressive, and then he wound up

503
00:23:45,545 --> 00:23:46,766
just like gunning a bunch of people down.

504
00:23:47,772 --> 00:23:51,474
He was like, whoa, whoa, whoa, I didn't quite want to be that aggressive.

505
00:23:52,455 --> 00:23:56,337
So intrigue the player, but inform them of generally what's going to happen.

506
00:23:56,397 --> 00:23:58,338
You can surprise them, but don't make them angry.

507
00:23:58,418 --> 00:24:03,522
So if you surprise them in a pleasant way, awesome, great, that's the joy, the joy of

508
00:24:03,582 --> 00:24:05,743
story as it unfolds.

509
00:24:06,063 --> 00:24:09,926
But don't make them mad, because then they just feel like they were sort of tricked into

510
00:24:09,946 --> 00:24:11,227
picking something that they didn't want to take.

511
00:24:12,287 --> 00:24:13,628
Differentiate the consequences.

512
00:24:13,668 --> 00:24:15,549
This is super-duper important.

513
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:23,134
False choices, not all players pick up on them, but players are simultaneously smarter

514
00:24:23,354 --> 00:24:27,997
and dumber than we think they are, and a lot of them do pick up on fake choices.

515
00:24:28,157 --> 00:24:31,099
They sense it very quickly, especially if a game uses them a lot.

516
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,601
So I would say, let's just stop doing it.

517
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:35,242
Everybody, let's stop doing it.

518
00:24:35,282 --> 00:24:35,562
Thank you.

519
00:24:38,365 --> 00:24:39,825
Lace consequences with sacrifice.

520
00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:43,327
So, I'll get into some differences in choice agony,

521
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:45,308
but when a person makes a choice,

522
00:24:46,409 --> 00:24:47,989
they should feel like they're making a trade-off.

523
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:51,491
The idea with sacrifice is always that you get something more out of it than you lose,

524
00:24:51,811 --> 00:24:53,232
because that's why you made the sacrifice,

525
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,033
but you should feel like you did make a trade-off there.

526
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,054
And ideally...

527
00:24:57,774 --> 00:25:01,860
It's a bunch of different options where there's some pros and cons and they're not easy choices, but they don't have to be

528
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,302
horribly intense

529
00:25:04,123 --> 00:25:08,329
And that push-pull conflict produces agony and that generally speaking is good when it doesn't go too far

530
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:13,489
Validating the options of choice and consequence.

531
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:15,451
Again, this goes back to when you make a choice,

532
00:25:15,692 --> 00:25:17,374
you want to validate it, say, yes, player,

533
00:25:17,714 --> 00:25:19,516
this is a correct way to play the game.

534
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:21,438
You're the character you chose to play.

535
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:22,800
We support that.

536
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,442
You can keep rolling with this.

537
00:25:24,482 --> 00:25:26,024
If you make a similar choice down the road,

538
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,786
it's also going to be supported.

539
00:25:27,846 --> 00:25:28,566
Keep on trucking.

540
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:29,007
Good job.

541
00:25:31,103 --> 00:25:32,925
This is in contrast to choice and no consequence.

542
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:34,526
I'll pick a little bit on Dragon Age here.

543
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,127
Dragon Age had a lot of cool stuff in it.

544
00:25:36,588 --> 00:25:37,749
This isn't one of them, sorry.

545
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:41,472
You have a bunch of options that people talk about

546
00:25:41,612 --> 00:25:42,552
and it doesn't produce anything.

547
00:25:42,652 --> 00:25:44,934
There's absolutely no different ending result

548
00:25:44,954 --> 00:25:46,135
from you picking any of these options.

549
00:25:46,175 --> 00:25:47,676
You can circle through it over and over again

550
00:25:48,497 --> 00:25:49,658
and it's the same outcome.

551
00:25:50,318 --> 00:25:51,679
It's kind of a waste of the player's time

552
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,181
and it's a waste of the writer's time.

553
00:25:54,963 --> 00:25:55,824
We've done this in the past.

554
00:25:55,904 --> 00:25:56,304
Oh, sorry.

555
00:25:56,384 --> 00:25:56,724
Oh, jeez.

556
00:25:56,924 --> 00:25:57,664
We've done this in the past.

557
00:25:57,684 --> 00:25:59,365
A lot of companies have done this in the past.

558
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:03,566
I think we do it because we feel that we want to give the player options, but again, players

559
00:26:03,586 --> 00:26:04,326
pick up on this stuff.

560
00:26:04,586 --> 00:26:05,586
They get irritated with it.

561
00:26:05,966 --> 00:26:09,567
If you do it a lot, they get really bored of your dialogue because they feel like the

562
00:26:09,607 --> 00:26:10,867
choices they make don't mean anything.

563
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,408
Versus win and loss.

564
00:26:13,768 --> 00:26:15,609
So again, Fallout New Vegas, we did this all over the place.

565
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:16,329
This is also bad.

566
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,491
When you come into this situation,

567
00:26:20,232 --> 00:26:22,173
unless you just want to fight, which is, you know,

568
00:26:22,273 --> 00:26:24,035
you can still fight even after taking this option,

569
00:26:24,055 --> 00:26:25,456
but this option makes it incredibly easy.

570
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:27,077
You can come in here, you have a high speech,

571
00:26:27,177 --> 00:26:27,898
and you can just say,

572
00:26:27,918 --> 00:26:30,459
hey man, I'm here to drop off some drugs, see ya.

573
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,321
And then you just walk around and steal everything

574
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:33,822
and then come back and C4 everyone

575
00:26:33,862 --> 00:26:34,623
or whatever you want to do.

576
00:26:35,783 --> 00:26:36,744
If you have a high speech,

577
00:26:37,144 --> 00:26:41,007
you're kind of like shooting yourself in the foot

578
00:26:41,027 --> 00:26:41,968
if you don't pick this option.

579
00:26:42,028 --> 00:26:43,669
So we're kind of saying like, if you don't take this,

580
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,591
you're playing at a disadvantage,

581
00:26:45,851 --> 00:26:47,292
not really that great or satisfying.

582
00:26:49,015 --> 00:26:51,717
So I want to talk about choice extremes.

583
00:26:51,997 --> 00:27:05,626
So that's how to spell extremes, by the way, officially.

584
00:27:06,645 --> 00:27:10,648
So there are kind of two ends of the spectrum here, neither of which I feel are particularly great.

585
00:27:11,188 --> 00:27:12,809
One is the sort of Jesus-Hitler option.

586
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,271
Again, a lot of our games have had these.

587
00:27:15,591 --> 00:27:18,773
Hopefully we've moved mostly away from these because we like moral ambiguity a lot.

588
00:27:19,273 --> 00:27:20,574
Jesus-Hitler is kind of like,

589
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:23,956
hey, there's a baby. Do you want to give the baby a little smooch on the forehead,

590
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:25,157
or do you want to throw it into an oven?

591
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:32,264
And we see those options, and they're not really compelling.

592
00:27:32,524 --> 00:27:35,245
Like, if you've decided you want to play a crazy dude,

593
00:27:35,645 --> 00:27:37,786
then there's no struggle to figure out what you want to do.

594
00:27:37,806 --> 00:27:38,547
There's no sacrifice.

595
00:27:38,587 --> 00:27:40,067
Just like, well, yeah, I'm a crazy baby killer.

596
00:27:40,107 --> 00:27:40,508
There you go.

597
00:27:41,388 --> 00:27:42,869
Or no, like, I'm a super nice guy.

598
00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:43,689
Why would I ever do that?

599
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:47,451
So there's no real interesting choice to be made there.

600
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:48,131
It's very flat.

601
00:27:48,191 --> 00:27:50,532
It is an option, and it is differentiated, hopefully,

602
00:27:50,572 --> 00:27:51,252
in how it works out.

603
00:27:51,272 --> 00:27:52,473
But it's not that compelling.

604
00:27:53,373 --> 00:27:55,234
And then also, then the other end of the extreme

605
00:27:55,254 --> 00:27:56,035
is Sophie's Choice.

606
00:27:56,715 --> 00:27:59,777
Spoilers for a 30-some year old book.

607
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:07,962
So yeah, Meryl Streep's character, she has to choose between which of her children will

608
00:28:08,142 --> 00:28:08,423
die.

609
00:28:10,664 --> 00:28:12,165
No one wants to make that sort of a choice in a game.

610
00:28:13,366 --> 00:28:13,926
There's no sad...

611
00:28:13,946 --> 00:28:16,268
It's not like, wow, I'm so glad I made that choice instead of that one.

612
00:28:16,308 --> 00:28:17,529
It's just two shitty choices.

613
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:20,591
So a player should feel like there's something good.

614
00:28:21,543 --> 00:28:25,404
and bad out of what they pick. Not just like, well, which limb do I lose? Or like, which

615
00:28:25,464 --> 00:28:29,285
child do I sacrifice? Those choices, they're interesting in the sense that they produce

616
00:28:29,305 --> 00:28:33,926
some struggle, but the player really doesn't feel good about having to make those choices.

617
00:28:33,966 --> 00:28:39,367
So ideally, the agony in the conflict is somewhere between these two spectrums. It's not as simple

618
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:43,528
as Jesus-Hitler, and it's not heart-wrenching, total loss like Sophie's choice.

619
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:48,501
Just some examples from... actually these are kind of nasty too.

620
00:28:49,662 --> 00:28:51,224
But they're differentiated in an important way.

621
00:28:51,284 --> 00:28:53,727
So choice agony is...

622
00:28:54,247 --> 00:28:56,910
Greek plays do this really, really well and very consistently.

623
00:28:57,451 --> 00:28:58,332
Greek plays will...

624
00:28:59,013 --> 00:29:00,414
Spoilers for thousand-year-old plays.

625
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:09,121
So in this case, the agony is not between two things that are,

626
00:29:09,701 --> 00:29:12,062
to borrow an economics term that I learned yesterday, fungible.

627
00:29:12,883 --> 00:29:15,944
They're not between like a child or this child or this arm or this arm.

628
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:19,746
In the case of Orestes and Antigone, it's a choice between

629
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:22,687
two kind of equally bad and equally good options,

630
00:29:22,787 --> 00:29:26,849
but the sort of value arithmetic that goes into it is not equal.

631
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:30,410
Orestes' father was killed by his mother,

632
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:31,891
and I think it's Apollo.

633
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:35,412
is saying, yo, you have to avenge your dad, kill your mom.

634
00:29:35,472 --> 00:29:38,214
And the Furies are saying, dude, you cannot kill your mom.

635
00:29:38,294 --> 00:29:39,154
That is bad news.

636
00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:41,515
He's like, oh man, and he kills his mom,

637
00:29:41,535 --> 00:29:42,416
and then the Furies chase him.

638
00:29:42,516 --> 00:29:43,997
And it's, oh my god, how agonizing.

639
00:29:44,857 --> 00:29:47,238
Antigone wants to honor her brother, bury her brother.

640
00:29:47,258 --> 00:29:50,140
I think it's her dad, says, you can't do that, I forbid it.

641
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,321
And she's like, wow, this is agonizing.

642
00:29:52,341 --> 00:29:53,602
And then she goes over and does it.

643
00:29:53,884 --> 00:29:56,085
So again, the value arithmetic there is not,

644
00:29:56,726 --> 00:29:58,667
oh yeah, well it's just six of one, half dozen of the other.

645
00:29:58,687 --> 00:29:59,828
It's two different things.

646
00:29:59,908 --> 00:30:01,509
And when a person reads that,

647
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:03,590
one person might say, well, I value this more than that.

648
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:04,590
I value this more than that.

649
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,631
And that's what makes our individual choices

650
00:30:06,672 --> 00:30:08,132
more interesting, as opposed to,

651
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:09,773
hey, what color do you dislike more?

652
00:30:11,274 --> 00:30:13,135
It's not to be confused with spice agony.

653
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:18,398
Just so you know, choice agony is not spice agony.

654
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:20,720
Arguably, spice agony is even cooler

655
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,520
because it's from Dune.

656
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:22,581
So.

657
00:30:24,543 --> 00:30:25,724
But it's not the same. Sorry, guys.

658
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:27,505
So the second step...

659
00:30:28,265 --> 00:30:29,266
I guess I'm doing okay on time,

660
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:30,687
even though I'm screwing around all the time.

661
00:30:31,908 --> 00:30:34,970
The second step is to define the range of character and player expression.

662
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:36,571
This is really about,

663
00:30:36,631 --> 00:30:38,972
hey, what sort of characters do you want to allow people to play?

664
00:30:39,012 --> 00:30:40,954
And are you going to support through the choices that you give?

665
00:30:41,754 --> 00:30:44,695
So you want to define a response and reactivity scope.

666
00:30:44,715 --> 00:30:46,415
This means what can the player say

667
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:47,796
and how are people going to react to it.

668
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:48,996
It's very important to figure out.

669
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:51,257
What sort of character prototypes?

670
00:30:51,677 --> 00:30:53,377
I'm just using, I made up that term

671
00:30:53,437 --> 00:30:54,538
because I didn't want to use archetype.

672
00:30:54,738 --> 00:30:55,378
I'll get into that later.

673
00:30:55,398 --> 00:30:57,298
What sort of character prototypes do you want to use?

674
00:30:57,738 --> 00:30:58,839
Support for character ideas.

675
00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:02,020
And then create a range of impacts that you can have.

676
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,740
These can be little impacts, big impacts.

677
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,840
They can be physical impacts,

678
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,581
emotional impacts, all over the place.

679
00:31:08,148 --> 00:31:10,830
So figuring out the scope of responses and reactivity is very important.

680
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:16,814
If you are making a game with very split morality, good and evil, that's your range.

681
00:31:17,214 --> 00:31:20,096
Is it about shades of gray, where there's a lot of moral ambiguity?

682
00:31:20,757 --> 00:31:23,138
Are the responses aligned along things like stance?

683
00:31:23,238 --> 00:31:25,100
So for example, Alpha Protocol had stances.

684
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,162
There are a number of games that have things like stances where they're more like attitudes.

685
00:31:29,523 --> 00:31:31,104
They're not really aligned along morality.

686
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,091
And then, what sort of reactivity are you going to have?

687
00:31:36,251 --> 00:31:38,613
What sort of scripted or direct reactivity are you going to have?

688
00:31:38,773 --> 00:31:42,555
And then also, what sort of indirect reputation mechanics are you going to have?

689
00:31:43,136 --> 00:31:44,497
Reputation, influence, things like that.

690
00:31:44,537 --> 00:31:47,739
So the player can get more frequent inputs into that system.

691
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,161
As an example, Fallout New Vegas' scope and range.

692
00:31:53,342 --> 00:31:54,182
It was really big.

693
00:31:55,023 --> 00:31:56,983
One of the cool things about the Fallout setting is that

694
00:31:57,043 --> 00:31:58,964
there's just so much crazy stuff in it.

695
00:32:00,244 --> 00:32:01,625
And designers have a lot of fun with that.

696
00:32:01,725 --> 00:32:03,105
Players usually have a lot of fun with it.

697
00:32:03,445 --> 00:32:05,506
It doesn't always result in a consistent experience, though.

698
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:08,767
So there's a huge scope of responses.

699
00:32:09,307 --> 00:32:10,608
Anything goes at any scale.

700
00:32:10,648 --> 00:32:12,969
So Fallout New Vegas, you couldn't kill children.

701
00:32:14,629 --> 00:32:16,289
because I don't think any games allow you to do that anymore,

702
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:18,070
but you can kill everyone else.

703
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,170
Like, everyone.

704
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:21,731
What I told the designers is that you have to imagine

705
00:32:21,751 --> 00:32:25,191
that the player has a, like, Thanatos kill field around them

706
00:32:25,231 --> 00:32:26,612
everywhere they go, and they just can't help it.

707
00:32:26,652 --> 00:32:27,792
They just— everyone drops dead.

708
00:32:28,372 --> 00:32:31,433
So, so, the whole game was structured

709
00:32:31,453 --> 00:32:32,593
so that you could kill everyone.

710
00:32:33,093 --> 00:32:35,194
Even your one sort of fall-through guy,

711
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:36,394
you could kill him, and he died,

712
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,614
but he would then transfer his consciousness

713
00:32:38,634 --> 00:32:39,975
into a different robot and come up to you.

714
00:32:40,035 --> 00:32:42,095
So, it was very important that we allowed that.

715
00:32:43,355 --> 00:32:47,979
Also, you can do all this crazy reverse triple betrayal stuff.

716
00:32:48,619 --> 00:32:50,621
Because of our reputation mechanics and the way that they worked,

717
00:32:51,021 --> 00:32:54,164
you could start out working for NCR, and then kind of drift over to Caesar's Legion,

718
00:32:54,204 --> 00:32:55,985
and then get on their good side, and then,

719
00:32:56,085 --> 00:32:57,666
oh, we're actually going to help out Mr. House,

720
00:32:57,686 --> 00:32:59,328
and then we're going to betray him and go independent.

721
00:32:59,348 --> 00:33:02,310
So there's a lot of things and ways that you could weave through the story.

722
00:33:03,071 --> 00:33:06,353
There's a lot of scripted reactivity, like a crazy amount of scripted reactivity.

723
00:33:06,874 --> 00:33:10,716
And all the credit for that goes to the writing team and the area designers that made that stuff happen.

724
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:15,592
And reputation, we had a reputation system for factions and for locations and that served

725
00:33:15,632 --> 00:33:19,642
as our indirect system where players would either perform actions or do dialogue things

726
00:33:19,702 --> 00:33:21,446
and resolve quests to feed into that system.

727
00:33:23,424 --> 00:33:25,686
So now I want to talk about prototypes.

728
00:33:25,926 --> 00:33:27,568
Again, I use this word instead of archetypes

729
00:33:27,648 --> 00:33:30,070
because I think that sometimes archetypes get,

730
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,491
that word kind of gets thrown around.

731
00:33:31,952 --> 00:33:33,553
Archetype is higher level than these guys.

732
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:35,014
Archetypes are more abstracted

733
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,355
than these individual characters.

734
00:33:37,276 --> 00:33:39,378
Prototypes to me in a role-playing game

735
00:33:39,598 --> 00:33:41,540
are starting points for character concepts.

736
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,801
They can be sole characters,

737
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:46,084
sometimes they're combinations of characters.

738
00:33:46,184 --> 00:33:47,005
I want to play Aragorn.

739
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,186
I want to play Snake Plissken.

740
00:33:51,851 --> 00:33:54,916
I want to play Clint Eastwood's racist character from Gran Torino.

741
00:33:56,938 --> 00:33:59,923
By the way, I really want to make an RPG where someone's like,

742
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,725
yes, I'm playing Clint Eastwood in Gran Torino.

743
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:08,125
The idea is that players really, they like, they gravitate towards these characters and

744
00:34:08,205 --> 00:34:10,547
players are creative but we all start somewhere.

745
00:34:10,707 --> 00:34:14,610
And so some players will be like, yeah I want to be the man with no name, I want to be Elizabeth

746
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,572
Salander from, you know, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I want to be Blade, whatever.

747
00:34:17,813 --> 00:34:21,055
There's a starting point and then over time they usually expand from there.

748
00:34:21,095 --> 00:34:25,058
But understanding what your game and your genre supports and where it's going to start

749
00:34:25,178 --> 00:34:25,899
is very helpful.

750
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:30,262
It's not just useful for defining dialogue but other things like dress and appearance

751
00:34:30,282 --> 00:34:31,523
and costuming and things like that.

752
00:34:32,224 --> 00:34:37,348
In fact, in New Vegas, the number of clothing mods you see for people that are supporting

753
00:34:37,388 --> 00:34:37,629
the man...

754
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:38,369
Like, everyone's,

755
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:39,410
Hey, I'm the man with no name.

756
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,872
Great, I'm Clint Eastwood in New Vegas.

757
00:34:40,952 --> 00:34:41,152
Great.

758
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,534
There's like a zillion different clothing packs that support that.

759
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,617
So understanding what people are going to want to play is very important.

760
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,921
What are the Fallout New Vegas prototypes?

761
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:51,162
Who knows?

762
00:34:51,322 --> 00:34:53,563
Because we didn't define them ahead of time, unfortunately.

763
00:34:54,024 --> 00:34:57,466
We knew we were going to have a huge range of influences

764
00:34:57,986 --> 00:35:00,948
and responses, but we didn't really sit down and think of

765
00:35:00,988 --> 00:35:02,168
this ahead of time, unfortunately.

766
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:05,850
So yeah, there's some stuff where you kind of feel like

767
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,631
the man with no name.

768
00:35:07,932 --> 00:35:10,013
Or you also kind of think about, you feel like Mad Max.

769
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:10,653
Surprise!

770
00:35:10,693 --> 00:35:11,534
These are the same character.

771
00:35:12,354 --> 00:35:13,955
One is in Australia, one's in the United States.

772
00:35:14,415 --> 00:35:15,836
They're kind of the same dude, though.

773
00:35:17,629 --> 00:35:22,555
And there's some stuff where you feel kind of like this weird spec ops guy that's that beard guy.

774
00:35:22,875 --> 00:35:23,997
You know who I'm talking about.

775
00:35:24,017 --> 00:35:25,598
It's that beard guy.

776
00:35:27,461 --> 00:35:27,621
And...

777
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:31,145
Oh, I know he has a real name, but everyone knows him as that beard guy.

778
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,751
but you know that but we don't really fully support it and there's other

779
00:35:34,772 --> 00:35:37,033
things that we could have supported post-apocalyptic characters

780
00:35:37,673 --> 00:35:39,034
like all the crazy tribal

781
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,775
people from doomsday or even the like the tribal kids from

782
00:35:43,496 --> 00:35:44,716
beyond thunderdome and stuff like that

783
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:47,718
but we didn't really think about it also there are other examples of like

784
00:35:47,958 --> 00:35:49,839
strong female characters like Alice from the

785
00:35:50,139 --> 00:35:52,620
Resident Evil series could be considered a post-apocalyptic character

786
00:35:53,441 --> 00:35:55,962
but we didn't really think through like what what are we trying to support

787
00:35:56,102 --> 00:35:56,842
unfortunately so

788
00:35:57,223 --> 00:35:58,443
the range of responses was

789
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:01,672
Granted in the Fallout universe they're already all over the place but they didn't really

790
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:04,079
feel like you were playing a consistent character necessarily.

791
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:06,597
You want to create a range of impacts.

792
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:08,739
Choices should have impact.

793
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,081
Again, this goes back to don't just kind of make fluff or meaningless choices.

794
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:15,143
You want to ground them and make the player feel like, wow, I'm cool.

795
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:17,704
Like that actually did something. It wasn't just sort of an aesthetic change.

796
00:36:18,505 --> 00:36:21,567
You can also make that happen through indirect reaction systems.

797
00:36:21,587 --> 00:36:22,447
When the player sees...

798
00:36:22,968 --> 00:36:24,088
And some people complain about this.

799
00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:25,029
Tough shit.

800
00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:27,951
When I say like, plus one to reputation, you know...

801
00:36:27,971 --> 00:36:29,972
I know it's not... it's my immersion.

802
00:36:30,672 --> 00:36:34,295
gets broken, but you see, hey, that actually fed into the system.

803
00:36:34,535 --> 00:36:35,596
Great. It's good feedback.

804
00:36:36,016 --> 00:36:38,037
So as game designers, even though some people get all

805
00:36:38,378 --> 00:36:40,739
worked up about it, it's very good to reward people that way.

806
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,961
And then, the important thing, I think, to remember is that

807
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:46,183
narrative or emotional impact is the important scale.

808
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:49,925
These are examples of two big impacts from Fallout New Vegas.

809
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:54,121
One is Archimedes, too, this big space laser, and that was in all the trailers.

810
00:36:55,022 --> 00:36:57,503
I don't really think that choice had a big emotional impact on a lot of people.

811
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:02,227
The only person that has a strong emotional reaction to it is one of the companions, Arcade,

812
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:05,389
and it's pretty unlikely that you actually have him at that point.

813
00:37:06,529 --> 00:37:09,051
It doesn't really influence a lot of things around it, so even though it's like a big event...

814
00:37:09,782 --> 00:37:11,284
there's not a lot of emotional strength to it.

815
00:37:11,404 --> 00:37:13,787
So it's like, wow, the crazy space laser, I don't care.

816
00:37:13,807 --> 00:37:15,089
I'm just going to go on with my adventure.

817
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:18,473
Compare this to, I think, the DLC, especially all the DL...

818
00:37:18,574 --> 00:37:20,336
So I did one of the DLCs, Honest Hearts.

819
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:23,059
I'm only putting up here because this is the one that I did, but...

820
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:26,604
Chris Avalon was the project director on all the other DLCs

821
00:37:26,664 --> 00:37:28,526
other than Gunrunner's Arsenal, and they had great...

822
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:30,627
emotional content to them.

823
00:37:30,787 --> 00:37:32,367
People really connected with the characters,

824
00:37:32,707 --> 00:37:33,628
did a great job there.

825
00:37:34,688 --> 00:37:36,788
In Honest Hearts, you know, the sort of resolution of it,

826
00:37:36,828 --> 00:37:38,649
people seem to respond very strongly to

827
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:40,489
because it was a very tense moment between, really,

828
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:41,930
just three people in a very small space.

829
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,030
But that sort of stuff can go a long way.

830
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:45,970
So the scale is really about emotional impact

831
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:47,591
when it comes to change.

832
00:37:47,771 --> 00:37:49,331
When the player feels like they're producing something

833
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,692
that really tugs at them...

834
00:37:50,712 --> 00:37:52,392
I keep doing this and I shouldn't...

835
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,093
that it makes them feel good about the choices that they make.

836
00:37:57,876 --> 00:38:02,438
Something I think was much better defined in terms of scope and prototype characters was alpha protocol.

837
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:03,478
It was very clearly defined.

838
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:07,280
So, they had the professional and suave and aggressive stances.

839
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,500
There were variants to that that would appear in dialogue,

840
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,602
but that's pretty much what was established for the spectrum of responses.

841
00:38:12,622 --> 00:38:15,823
A lot of heavily scripted reactivity.

842
00:38:16,182 --> 00:38:18,804
They also had a reputation mechanic that was used very frequently.

843
00:38:19,805 --> 00:38:22,087
And they had three prototypes. It took a while to settle on this,

844
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:23,988
but it was called the Three JBs.

845
00:38:24,489 --> 00:38:26,270
Jason Bourne, James Bond, Jack Bauer.

846
00:38:26,891 --> 00:38:32,635
Equipment choices, dialogue options, all that sort of stuff kind of fed into that.

847
00:38:32,715 --> 00:38:35,738
It's like, if I want to play like Jason Bourne, I'm going to want to say this sort of thing.

848
00:38:36,138 --> 00:38:39,920
If I want to play like Jack Bauer, I'm going to smack this guy in the face and get all aggro on him.

849
00:38:41,381 --> 00:38:43,562
And that really helped drive a lot of the choice.

850
00:38:43,602 --> 00:38:45,303
People were like, oh, okay, yeah, yeah, I get those guys.

851
00:38:45,764 --> 00:38:47,805
This is the space that we're working in, which is very important.

852
00:38:49,886 --> 00:38:51,967
So step three is about establishing narrative goals.

853
00:38:53,728 --> 00:38:57,371
Ideally, you should fuse information and emotional content, not do info dumps.

854
00:38:58,305 --> 00:39:01,871
You should separate your critical information from optional information.

855
00:39:01,951 --> 00:39:05,376
This is very important when you remember, hey, players can go around smacking dudes

856
00:39:05,456 --> 00:39:09,041
and skipping over stuff and short-cutting all sorts of things in dialogue.

857
00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:11,325
And you want to outline your narrative branching ahead of time.

858
00:39:13,213 --> 00:39:14,534
A lot of people look at New Vegas,

859
00:39:15,115 --> 00:39:16,396
maybe not everyone, but a lot of people look at it

860
00:39:16,416 --> 00:39:18,117
and they go like, wow, how did you plan all that stuff out?

861
00:39:18,197 --> 00:39:20,259
And it's actually, I don't want to say it's easy,

862
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,660
but when you do it from the beginning,

863
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:23,461
it is not especially hard.

864
00:39:23,942 --> 00:39:26,404
If you try to do it six months down the road, forget it.

865
00:39:27,224 --> 00:39:28,045
Any game that I've worked on

866
00:39:28,085 --> 00:39:29,586
where we've planned for the stuff ahead of time,

867
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:31,428
it's gone very, very smoothly.

868
00:39:32,148 --> 00:39:33,309
Once you start developing the game

869
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:35,271
and you try to back into a bunch of freedom

870
00:39:35,311 --> 00:39:38,593
of play and movement and choice, it doesn't go so well.

871
00:39:41,455 --> 00:39:42,216
So don't do this.

872
00:39:44,354 --> 00:39:49,918
Dialog branching is, I think, at its weakest when it comes down to essentially being no more than a keyword list,

873
00:39:49,938 --> 00:39:52,660
where you're saying, hey, tell me about this, tell me about this, tell me about this.

874
00:39:54,462 --> 00:39:55,783
I think there are much better ways to do it.

875
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:59,365
I think that Mass Effect putting stuff in the codex is a really good way to do it,

876
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:01,487
other than the XP gain, which I think should be gotten rid of.

877
00:40:02,348 --> 00:40:04,429
Also, Bioshock does it really well.

878
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:07,652
They have, like, essentially three levels of interaction where there's the main storyline,

879
00:40:08,052 --> 00:40:11,254
there's the stuff you can hear through all the tape recorders and things like that.

880
00:40:11,695 --> 00:40:12,675
Thank you for reminding me of that.

881
00:40:13,096 --> 00:40:13,756
And then also the...

882
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:19,803
all the posters and things where you can infer and imply all sorts of other relationships by looking around.

883
00:40:20,264 --> 00:40:23,267
So there are other ways to give information about the world and what's going on in it

884
00:40:23,608 --> 00:40:25,550
than just info-dumping onto the player.

885
00:40:27,151 --> 00:40:29,574
If you can give information about the world to the player,

886
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:32,577
try to sort of wrap it inside the emotional content of something else.

887
00:40:32,617 --> 00:40:34,199
So a character is talking about something...

888
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:36,076
that's important to them.

889
00:40:36,316 --> 00:40:38,037
And in the context of talking about that thing,

890
00:40:38,638 --> 00:40:39,758
you're learning about the world.

891
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:41,439
If you just have someone sort of stand there

892
00:40:41,479 --> 00:40:42,860
and dryly tell you about the world,

893
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,742
they're just a narrator for an encyclopedia,

894
00:40:44,782 --> 00:40:45,582
and that gets really boring.

895
00:40:47,217 --> 00:40:50,759
You have to figure out what your critical and optional information is going to be in the game.

896
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,963
Again, very few players want information dumps and dialogue.

897
00:40:56,924 --> 00:40:59,686
Most players, they do want to understand what's going on.

898
00:41:00,746 --> 00:41:03,208
Usually they're skipping through things because it goes on for too long

899
00:41:03,248 --> 00:41:05,490
and tries to tell them much more than they actually need to know.

900
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,433
If you write your story well, the player should not need to know a huge amount of information

901
00:41:10,453 --> 00:41:12,194
to understand the meat of the plot.

902
00:41:13,235 --> 00:41:16,858
And they really shouldn't need to know much about what they're doing in the next stage of their adventure.

903
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:22,231
By the way, hints and hanging references, those are also exposition.

904
00:41:22,311 --> 00:41:24,513
A person can reference something without defining it.

905
00:41:25,013 --> 00:41:26,234
That's fine, let it go.

906
00:41:26,435 --> 00:41:29,478
Like, let it hang there, the person will be intrigued, look it up later,

907
00:41:29,518 --> 00:41:32,481
maybe another character references that group or organization or religion later.

908
00:41:32,921 --> 00:41:33,982
Maybe it's never defined.

909
00:41:34,302 --> 00:41:35,824
And the player goes, huh, I wonder what that is.

910
00:41:36,464 --> 00:41:39,127
I've gotten so many questions for Fallout New Vegas.

911
00:41:40,028 --> 00:41:42,570
Because Chief Hanlon, Chris Christopherson's character, says,

912
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,492
yeah, all the veteran rangers are hunting ghosts down in Baja.

913
00:41:46,052 --> 00:41:48,414
And it's like, every week I get two or three people saying,

914
00:41:48,934 --> 00:41:49,774
what is he talking about?

915
00:41:50,495 --> 00:41:52,016
I am never going to tell you what that is.

916
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:53,177
Never, never, never.

917
00:41:53,737 --> 00:41:55,218
Like, something weird's going on down there.

918
00:41:55,238 --> 00:41:56,759
They're in Baja, that sounds mysterious.

919
00:41:56,819 --> 00:41:57,800
Great, just let it go.

920
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,981
That's a side thing.

921
00:41:59,521 --> 00:42:00,362
Cool, that's intriguing.

922
00:42:01,818 --> 00:42:05,401
Narrative branching. Obviously you have to guarantee that all the critical information

923
00:42:05,441 --> 00:42:09,804
is communicated. If you allow the player to do something that breaks their understanding

924
00:42:09,824 --> 00:42:15,269
of the game, that is very bad. You have to have ways to handle that. You want to isolate

925
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:20,553
reactivity. So reactivity is awesome, and players love reactivity. I think a trap people

926
00:42:20,573 --> 00:42:22,755
fall into is they want to make the reactivity really...

927
00:42:24,476 --> 00:42:27,278
huge ripple effect from any, like a pebble hits the water and

928
00:42:27,718 --> 00:42:30,340
you know like thousands of people are changed forever and it's

929
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,882
very messy. Players don't actually notice it or appreciate it. It causes a lot of bugs.

930
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:38,245
You can actually do a lot of more like very localized reactivity

931
00:42:38,845 --> 00:42:41,327
and players feel like the world is very rich with the reactivity

932
00:42:41,647 --> 00:42:44,929
but it's very light scripting and bug fixing wise.

933
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:48,483
And then generally speaking, more branching is better than bigger branches.

934
00:42:48,784 --> 00:42:53,725
So it's more interesting to have little ways to alter the story

935
00:42:53,825 --> 00:42:57,706
and then feed into other things than to try to make one big, massive narrative

936
00:42:57,746 --> 00:42:59,146
that branches out in a million different ways.

937
00:43:00,346 --> 00:43:05,148
Just recombinant-wise, it becomes very difficult to manage that stuff and to bug-fix it.

938
00:43:06,488 --> 00:43:08,588
So here's an example from Fallout New Vegas.

939
00:43:09,551 --> 00:43:10,712
but I think worked pretty darn well.

940
00:43:11,733 --> 00:43:14,055
They Went That-A-Way was the first main quest that you go on.

941
00:43:14,155 --> 00:43:15,817
So, Fallen to Vegas starts with you being shot in the head

942
00:43:15,917 --> 00:43:16,918
and dropped in a shallow grave,

943
00:43:17,278 --> 00:43:18,959
and your first quest is to go find the people that did it.

944
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:23,443
So, your first steps are completely informational

945
00:43:23,483 --> 00:43:24,684
and independent of each other.

946
00:43:25,345 --> 00:43:27,247
It's really just, where did this dude go?

947
00:43:27,267 --> 00:43:29,549
It's Benny, the guy in the crazy checkered suit.

948
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:30,089
Where did he go?

949
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:32,631
And you go from step to step,

950
00:43:32,712 --> 00:43:34,273
and each person tells you something more

951
00:43:34,493 --> 00:43:35,734
that you follow and follow and follow.

952
00:43:36,665 --> 00:43:40,116
Because they're just information and they're independent of each other, the player can

953
00:43:40,256 --> 00:43:42,263
actually go straight to New Vegas from Goodsprings.

954
00:43:43,381 --> 00:43:45,163
without ever going into any of the other steps.

955
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:46,884
They can do things in different orders.

956
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:48,425
They can go straight to Novak through a pass.

957
00:43:48,846 --> 00:43:50,227
They can go to Boulder City.

958
00:43:50,667 --> 00:43:51,969
They can do things in all sorts of different order

959
00:43:52,009 --> 00:43:53,110
because the story still makes sense.

960
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:55,932
The story is, find out who shot me and where that person is.

961
00:43:56,573 --> 00:43:58,334
If you just walk into Vegas, the story still makes sense.

962
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,496
You miss little side details.

963
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:02,458
Actually, you miss quite a few side details along the way,

964
00:44:02,918 --> 00:44:04,239
but the story is flexible.

965
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,022
And by the way, we just totally ripped off Fallout 1 for this.

966
00:44:07,042 --> 00:44:08,863
We just ripped it right off.

967
00:44:09,043 --> 00:44:09,744
If you look at Fallout 1...

968
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:14,157
The first critical step, you leave the vault, find the water chip.

969
00:44:14,217 --> 00:44:17,418
That is actually the first critical path thing that you need to do, is find the water chip.

970
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:20,300
You can walk from Vault 13 to the Necropolis.

971
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,001
You do not have to do anything else in between.

972
00:44:24,342 --> 00:44:27,444
That's the way the story makes sense, because you're pointed, hey, go check out Vault 15.

973
00:44:27,964 --> 00:44:28,625
Oh, it's not there.

974
00:44:28,845 --> 00:44:29,745
Oh, go back to this town.

975
00:44:29,985 --> 00:44:30,826
Oh, what's that, raiders?

976
00:44:31,006 --> 00:44:32,027
Oh, okay, I'll go to the raider den.

977
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,707
Oh, go to the here.

978
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:36,949
So it unfolds in a very logical fashion, but the player's not required to do things that

979
00:44:36,989 --> 00:44:38,190
way, because it's all about information.

980
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:41,033
The reactivity is very localized to those places.

981
00:44:41,733 --> 00:44:43,735
So reactivity is in that space.

982
00:44:44,036 --> 00:44:46,078
And then later on, maybe we'll have,

983
00:44:46,198 --> 00:44:47,399
we do this all over New Vegas.

984
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:49,641
You do a quest, hours later some random dude

985
00:44:49,661 --> 00:44:50,662
out in the middle of nowhere goes,

986
00:44:50,922 --> 00:44:52,804
hey, a reaction to the quest that you did.

987
00:44:52,824 --> 00:44:53,785
And they're like, oh my god,

988
00:44:53,805 --> 00:44:55,407
this world is full of all this reactivity.

989
00:44:56,628 --> 00:45:01,571
But it's really just that one character doing that one thing and then it's completely forgotten about.

990
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:04,733
But if you do that for a ton of quests, then people go like,

991
00:45:04,773 --> 00:45:08,275
wow, there is really a lot of stuff going on where people remember and do things and this world is alive.

992
00:45:09,076 --> 00:45:11,698
Critical information is always the next step. That's very important.

993
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:14,780
Supplemental info is seasoned all over the place.

994
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,061
And the player freedom is huge. You can kill everyone.

995
00:45:17,541 --> 00:45:20,203
You can go to the first town, where are these guys? Bam, bam, bam.

996
00:45:20,223 --> 00:45:23,005
The guy's like, I don't want to tell you. Bam, shoot him, take a thing off his body.

997
00:45:23,465 --> 00:45:24,966
Go to the next town. Hey, who are all you guys?

998
00:45:25,607 --> 00:45:26,007
Cool.

999
00:45:27,388 --> 00:45:28,229
Go to the next town.

1000
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:31,632
And the story, it makes sense because all the information

1001
00:45:31,692 --> 00:45:31,992
is there.

1002
00:45:32,032 --> 00:45:34,454
You go to the next town, the guy in the dinosaur mani

1003
00:45:34,494 --> 00:45:36,596
says, well, I know where those guys are, but I need help.

1004
00:45:36,656 --> 00:45:37,897
And you're like, yeah, you need help.

1005
00:45:37,977 --> 00:45:38,658
You need a doctor.

1006
00:45:38,678 --> 00:45:40,259
You take it.

1007
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,122
And I mean, you can kill everyone.

1008
00:45:43,162 --> 00:45:44,323
You don't have to do it.

1009
00:45:44,343 --> 00:45:46,284
You can just keep going, and the story totally makes sense.

1010
00:45:46,324 --> 00:45:47,345
And you're just a swirlwind of death.

1011
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:49,013
and it worked very well.

1012
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:52,195
So the fourth step is to get some perspective on this stuff.

1013
00:45:53,495 --> 00:45:55,836
So this is your analysis, where you've sort of looked at all these things.

1014
00:45:56,276 --> 00:45:57,877
When you start to look at the choices you're giving,

1015
00:45:58,277 --> 00:45:59,138
are they satisfactory?

1016
00:45:59,598 --> 00:46:02,359
So, outside of what you've defined, when you say like,

1017
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:03,900
if a player were playing this,

1018
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,421
are they going to like the choices that they're given,

1019
00:46:06,621 --> 00:46:08,141
and are they going to like how they play out?

1020
00:46:09,531 --> 00:46:11,311
Look at the role-playing versus the benefit.

1021
00:46:11,471 --> 00:46:12,892
If I'm playing a certain type of character,

1022
00:46:13,352 --> 00:46:17,574
do I get enough of a benefit that I don't feel like I'm being penalized for playing that sort of character?

1023
00:46:17,954 --> 00:46:20,595
And if there's a conflict, you have to identify what that conflict is.

1024
00:46:22,176 --> 00:46:23,477
Look at your critical and optional narrative.

1025
00:46:23,517 --> 00:46:28,179
Is the player getting everything that he or she needs to actually understand what the story is?

1026
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,060
Again, this is separate from the optional stuff.

1027
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,960
But the optional stuff, they can skip, that's fine.

1028
00:46:32,341 --> 00:46:33,721
Players that want to dig, they're going to dig.

1029
00:46:33,821 --> 00:46:35,422
You don't need to, like, force it in their face.

1030
00:46:35,442 --> 00:46:36,822
You don't need to bribe them to look at it.

1031
00:46:36,983 --> 00:46:37,383
That's fine.

1032
00:46:38,717 --> 00:46:39,377
then write your prose.

1033
00:46:40,438 --> 00:46:40,978
No problem, man.

1034
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:43,320
Super easy.

1035
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:46,883
Well, the point is that once you've identified the sort of range of the stuff,

1036
00:46:47,044 --> 00:46:49,285
it's not that necessarily writing prose is easy, but that

1037
00:46:50,406 --> 00:46:51,667
that spectrum has been

1038
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:53,109
codified much more.

1039
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:55,771
So when you start to make your choices about how to write it, it's in the

1040
00:46:55,811 --> 00:46:57,712
perspective of what the player is going to appreciate.

1041
00:46:58,233 --> 00:46:59,974
So writing prose is its own thing again,

1042
00:47:00,315 --> 00:47:02,656
but this is the setup for making branching dialogues.

1043
00:47:04,038 --> 00:47:04,958
So, in conclusion...

1044
00:47:06,486 --> 00:47:08,109
In conclusion, I screw this up one more time,

1045
00:47:09,151 --> 00:47:10,214
you are choice architects.

1046
00:47:10,434 --> 00:47:11,657
When you're building this stuff,

1047
00:47:11,937 --> 00:47:13,942
there's nothing neutral about the choices you're making.

1048
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:14,964
You have to plan it.

1049
00:47:16,065 --> 00:47:21,007
RPG players want good choices, and that's very subjective, but the idea is if you're

1050
00:47:21,027 --> 00:47:25,408
supporting a type of character in a character range, they want to feel like that's valid

1051
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:25,788
for them.

1052
00:47:26,569 --> 00:47:31,410
And the games that do this really well really make players love, I mean, they just love

1053
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:35,591
those games because they'll come up with, man, I see the craziest character concepts

1054
00:47:35,611 --> 00:47:38,592
people come up with for New Vegas, and a lot of it is in their head.

1055
00:47:38,632 --> 00:47:41,953
A lot of it is sort of self-narration about the sort of person they are and where they

1056
00:47:41,973 --> 00:47:42,413
came from.

1057
00:47:42,913 --> 00:47:43,854
Some of the craziest stuff.

1058
00:47:45,034 --> 00:47:48,796
But if the choices support it, then they feel really excited about it, and they really attach to it.

1059
00:47:49,817 --> 00:47:51,417
Designer and player goals can be in conflict.

1060
00:47:51,698 --> 00:47:53,979
Your narrative goals, their desires as a player.

1061
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:59,221
You have to resolve those conflicts, or at least accept the consequences of that conflict.

1062
00:47:59,662 --> 00:48:04,384
You can't resolve every single thing, but you have to at least recognize it, plan for it, and accept it.

1063
00:48:06,325 --> 00:48:06,825
Thank you very much.

1064
00:48:19,629 --> 00:48:21,575
I believe, hey, we have three microphones.

1065
00:48:22,097 --> 00:48:22,658
That's awesome.

1066
00:48:25,266 --> 00:48:25,487
Hello.

1067
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:28,100
So thank you so much for that great informative talk.

1068
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,443
I had a lot of amazing techniques for branching dialogues.

1069
00:48:32,584 --> 00:48:36,907
I'm wondering about your assertion about players wanting good choices.

1070
00:48:37,928 --> 00:48:40,110
And I totally believe you about most players,

1071
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,833
but it makes me think of players who look for hard choices

1072
00:48:44,053 --> 00:48:45,755
because they're not validated, right?

1073
00:48:46,295 --> 00:48:49,378
Like players who want to play a pacifist front of a certain type of game

1074
00:48:49,978 --> 00:48:52,140
because it's so hard and because it's unrewarding.

1075
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,742
I'm wondering, would you ever make a game where...

1076
00:48:55,522 --> 00:48:59,023
There's a set of choices that have no reward,

1077
00:48:59,563 --> 00:49:02,084
maybe until the very end, and if you just went without reward,

1078
00:49:02,104 --> 00:49:04,965
you get a single flower or something like that.

1079
00:49:05,645 --> 00:49:09,466
No, I think that's valid because what you're talking about is sort of...

1080
00:49:10,006 --> 00:49:13,486
Well, there's a reward there, but you have to identify what that reward is.

1081
00:49:13,807 --> 00:49:15,147
So people that play pacifist runs...

1082
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,347
Because you can play Fallout New Vegas as a pacifist run,

1083
00:49:18,988 --> 00:49:20,888
and I don't think you have to actually kill anybody.

1084
00:49:22,661 --> 00:49:26,246
People enjoy that and the reward is the fact that they didn't have to do that at all

1085
00:49:27,207 --> 00:49:28,089
The thing is though

1086
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:35,519
Inherently they know what's coming for them like they know that that's out there for example if we said hey

1087
00:49:35,979 --> 00:49:39,504
You can do a pacifist run of this and they got halfway through and we're like psych you got to kill this guy

1088
00:49:40,045 --> 00:49:43,609
they would be livid and pissed because we betrayed their expectations.

1089
00:49:43,649 --> 00:49:45,411
We did not forecast what was going to happen.

1090
00:49:47,012 --> 00:49:48,894
There is actually an interesting thing where,

1091
00:49:49,235 --> 00:49:50,436
for example, in Honest Hearts,

1092
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:53,720
there's a part where you're trying to evacuate,

1093
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,781
and you can play as a pacifist,

1094
00:49:54,801 --> 00:49:55,482
so you can go in there and you say,

1095
00:49:55,502 --> 00:49:56,903
like, I don't want to fight any of the white legs,

1096
00:49:57,143 --> 00:49:58,905
these tribals that are just butchering everyone.

1097
00:49:59,626 --> 00:49:59,986
And, um...

1098
00:50:01,587 --> 00:50:05,709
What Daniel says is, if you don't kill these guys, they're going to kill a ton of the sorrows,

1099
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,310
this very innocent group of people.

1100
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:09,891
And you can say, like, well, too bad, I'm not going to fight.

1101
00:50:10,492 --> 00:50:10,932
And you can do it.

1102
00:50:11,212 --> 00:50:15,675
But the consequence of that is forecast ahead of time to them.

1103
00:50:16,255 --> 00:50:19,677
And I think that, as long as you sort of communicate to them,

1104
00:50:19,937 --> 00:50:21,137
this is going to be the reward.

1105
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:26,412
this is, you know, it's sort of self-forecasting in the case of pacifism because that is, ahead

1106
00:50:26,432 --> 00:50:30,394
of time they know, I can do this, the whole game supports it, I can get through it, I

1107
00:50:30,434 --> 00:50:31,695
don't have to do it, that's fine.

1108
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:35,377
So you don't have to give them like a system reward, like you get a, you know, a special

1109
00:50:35,417 --> 00:50:36,718
bonus if you were a pacifist?

1110
00:50:37,138 --> 00:50:40,220
I don't think you have to, I mean, I think if you want to, that's fine, again, if you

1111
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,201
want to forecast that.

1112
00:50:41,741 --> 00:50:45,403
For a while we had challenges in New Vegas, they were too hard to track, but for what,

1113
00:50:45,583 --> 00:50:47,865
I can't remember the technical reason, but we had pacifist.

1114
00:50:48,425 --> 00:50:52,306
like sort of rewards for people that got to level 10 or level 20 without killing anyone.

1115
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:56,408
So you can build that in. I think the important thing is one way or another

1116
00:50:56,888 --> 00:51:00,109
you have to figure out what the player is actually going to enjoy because a lot of it is very subjective.

1117
00:51:00,829 --> 00:51:03,270
Some people just like being a good person

1118
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,031
and like people responding to them very warmly in the world.

1119
00:51:06,372 --> 00:51:08,152
And so that can be a very good reward for them.

1120
00:51:08,832 --> 00:51:09,073
Thanks.

1121
00:51:11,373 --> 00:51:14,615
Yeah, thank you. That was a great talk and fantastic game as well.

1122
00:51:15,663 --> 00:51:20,505
I think I was just wondering, where you were presenting there with the example where you

1123
00:51:20,525 --> 00:51:25,368
had the speech statistic and the notion that you can win a conversation.

1124
00:51:27,229 --> 00:51:31,211
And actually I found that was really effective in Fallout New Vegas because I could grow

1125
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:31,871
my character.

1126
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:36,838
in that way, because you know combat obviously is a gameplay system and you

1127
00:51:36,878 --> 00:51:37,758
resolve it by winning

1128
00:51:38,398 --> 00:51:42,260
and so you could have that ability to express yourself by growing in combat or

1129
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,581
express yourself by growing

1130
00:51:43,721 --> 00:51:46,202
in conversation. So if you remove the ability to

1131
00:51:46,862 --> 00:51:51,784
win in a conversation or to have a sense of having varying degrees of success

1132
00:51:51,905 --> 00:51:52,345
within that

1133
00:51:53,105 --> 00:51:55,826
system, how can you still

1134
00:51:56,507 --> 00:51:59,728
enable players to feel like they're growing in that part of their character

1135
00:51:59,808 --> 00:52:00,608
or that role?

1136
00:52:01,383 --> 00:52:03,225
I think it's a difficult question because

1137
00:52:04,566 --> 00:52:07,328
when we say that the player wins in there, there's not actually a game there.

1138
00:52:08,169 --> 00:52:12,032
Like the game, if anything, the game is the strategic game to put your points in

1139
00:52:12,072 --> 00:52:12,993
your speech skill,

1140
00:52:13,793 --> 00:52:14,974
but there's no real way

1141
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,782
There's no real way to forecast that stuff.

1142
00:52:19,482 --> 00:52:22,526
So if a player has already put the points in it

1143
00:52:22,566 --> 00:52:24,668
when they get to that point, there is no gameplay there.

1144
00:52:24,948 --> 00:52:25,969
It's just combat.

1145
00:52:26,389 --> 00:52:27,511
You put your points into your skill,

1146
00:52:27,551 --> 00:52:30,574
but then you still have to move around and actually choose

1147
00:52:30,594 --> 00:52:32,896
when to shoot and when to take cover, when to use your stems.

1148
00:52:33,477 --> 00:52:35,238
So it is a very difficult problem.

1149
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:37,020
And we've seen games that have tried to tackle this.

1150
00:52:37,801 --> 00:52:38,181
Oblivion.

1151
00:52:39,202 --> 00:52:47,328
tried to make it more gamey, and I don't think a lot of people responded super positively to that.

1152
00:52:47,948 --> 00:52:51,371
It's a difficult question. I don't know what the exact right answer is. I do feel that...

1153
00:52:52,642 --> 00:52:55,185
It doesn't have to be a skill that you put points into.

1154
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:58,428
I think that dialogue can be a thing that you feel like you navigate your way through

1155
00:52:58,468 --> 00:52:59,910
and you build reputations.

1156
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:03,473
I think there's a lot more that we can do with indirect reactivity mechanics that make

1157
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:05,175
people feel like they're playing through that.

1158
00:53:05,876 --> 00:53:09,560
The important thing to me is that people stop and think and they make their choices and

1159
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,221
they're weighing the tactical and strategic things.

1160
00:53:11,802 --> 00:53:13,283
Speech skill is not...

1161
00:53:14,164 --> 00:53:16,446
in conversation is not a tactical choice nor a strategic choice.

1162
00:53:17,107 --> 00:53:18,228
And that's what it comes down to for me.

1163
00:53:18,648 --> 00:53:21,130
And I'm sorry, I don't know where to go with that,

1164
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,692
but I know that a lot of people commented on it

1165
00:53:24,032 --> 00:53:25,854
and felt that it was kind of out of place.

1166
00:53:25,874 --> 00:53:28,216
Cool. Thank you.

1167
00:53:28,296 --> 00:53:28,876
Is there one more?

1168
00:53:31,562 --> 00:53:32,763
3, 2, 2? Great.

1169
00:53:32,803 --> 00:53:39,508
Can you talk a bit about the granularity of choices and where you figure out where to fall on that spectrum?

1170
00:53:39,528 --> 00:53:45,152
I think at the bottom of the spectrum of a game like Bioshock 2, where you had like 4 choices over the course of the game,

1171
00:53:45,453 --> 00:53:47,334
they were all incredibly memorable to me.

1172
00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:52,461
They were very difficult choices to make, and I remember every single one of them.

1173
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:56,983
At the far end of the scale, of course, something like Fallout New Vegas, where there are constant

1174
00:53:57,043 --> 00:54:02,066
choices, and each one feels, in a way, a little less important, because, I mean, it's a design

1175
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:02,667
choice in a way.

1176
00:54:02,867 --> 00:54:06,749
But then there's something in the middle, like Alpha Protocol, where fewer choices,

1177
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:07,810
but they're more meaningful.

1178
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:12,233
What do you do with that scale, and how do you sort of decide where to end up?

1179
00:54:13,197 --> 00:54:17,741
I think a lot of it has to do with, again, the range that you want to support, the range

1180
00:54:17,781 --> 00:54:21,004
of reactivity you want to support, and the range of expression that you want to support.

1181
00:54:21,564 --> 00:54:26,128
So I think early on in Bioshock, you know, I don't think the players are under any illusions

1182
00:54:26,189 --> 00:54:28,651
that they're going to be making a ton of choices.

1183
00:54:30,152 --> 00:54:32,975
And so there's limited numbers of choices, limited amount of reactivity.

1184
00:54:34,236 --> 00:54:38,159
In Alpha Protocol, it was, I think actually in many ways Alpha Protocol is kind of...

1185
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,001
the way to go as far as conversation mechanics go.

1186
00:54:41,342 --> 00:54:45,485
Because Alpha Protocol is, is, every conversation feels like a scene.

1187
00:54:46,025 --> 00:54:50,388
It has a beginning and an end and it like flows and people are talking about things

1188
00:54:50,449 --> 00:54:53,771
and it doesn't sort of branch out into a big info dump or anything like that.

1189
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:57,254
And you feel like you're making meaningful, meaningful choices in there.

1190
00:54:57,274 --> 00:55:01,797
But I think ultimately it has to do with figuring out how much expression do you want to actually

1191
00:55:01,837 --> 00:55:02,638
support in the game?

1192
00:55:03,198 --> 00:55:04,399
What do you think players are going to want to do?

1193
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,481
If you think players are going to come up...

1194
00:55:07,121 --> 00:55:08,623
against these situations where they say,

1195
00:55:08,703 --> 00:55:11,225
I really wish that I could do something

1196
00:55:11,305 --> 00:55:13,707
different in this situation, then that's

1197
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,189
something you consider like, well, maybe we

1198
00:55:15,209 --> 00:55:16,550
should have a choice here to determine

1199
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:17,651
how the player can go through it.

1200
00:55:18,792 --> 00:55:21,214
But I think it's a stylistic thing on a game by game basis.

1201
00:55:22,416 --> 00:55:24,197
So I guess one more question at least.

1202
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:36,663
You made a point about info dumping in dialogue and also your reference to one of the characters

1203
00:55:36,923 --> 00:55:39,244
making reference to something that actually wasn't in the game.

1204
00:55:40,764 --> 00:55:44,526
And I found my experience, especially with Skyrim, this didn't happen so much with Fallout

1205
00:55:44,546 --> 00:55:45,066
because I think...

1206
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:51,933
maybe the writing was better, but in Skyrim I felt the shallowness of kind of this big

1207
00:55:51,993 --> 00:55:55,876
fleshed out world at points because there were characters that I wanted to interact

1208
00:55:55,916 --> 00:56:02,320
with and know more about that didn't even have that kind of option to sort of engage

1209
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:07,904
further with them in a sense or that just that simple option like who are you type of deal.

1210
00:56:08,404 --> 00:56:11,426
And I was wondering like do you think there are?

1211
00:56:12,191 --> 00:56:17,713
better techniques within dialogue to sort of provide that kind of closure or bridge?

1212
00:56:18,113 --> 00:56:18,574
Yes, I do.

1213
00:56:18,754 --> 00:56:25,036
So I think that the answers to things don't always lie in films, but I think that we can

1214
00:56:25,056 --> 00:56:25,496
take a lot of...

1215
00:56:26,057 --> 00:56:26,717
There's never a point...

1216
00:56:26,777 --> 00:56:27,717
Well, I shouldn't say never.

1217
00:56:27,837 --> 00:56:31,399
It's very rare there's a point in a film where someone says, hey, I'm this guy.

1218
00:56:31,499 --> 00:56:34,100
Like every character comes in and I explain who I am and blah, blah, blah.

1219
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,420
It's done in the context...

1220
00:56:36,021 --> 00:56:37,941
It's done in the context of the plot.

1221
00:56:38,602 --> 00:56:42,583
And so you learn about the character through the context of the struggle.

1222
00:56:43,703 --> 00:56:47,364
And that's one of the reasons, again, why I think that Alpha Protocol did a really great

1223
00:56:47,384 --> 00:56:51,045
job, because every scene was about a thing.

1224
00:56:51,345 --> 00:56:55,046
Like two people or more in conflict, they want something, they're working towards it.

1225
00:56:55,646 --> 00:57:00,488
And in the course of that revelation, you learn about the character of that person.

1226
00:57:00,828 --> 00:57:01,408
Here's another thing.

1227
00:57:02,788 --> 00:57:06,310
Interesting conflict reveals tons about characters.

1228
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,852
the sort of Jesus Hitler characters, nobody finds those characters enjoyable.

1229
00:57:10,232 --> 00:57:13,814
But when you, like a character like Sophie in Sophie's Choice, that

1230
00:57:14,695 --> 00:57:18,317
wrecked her whole character. Or even if you look at, I was talking to my

1231
00:57:18,357 --> 00:57:21,299
friend Terry yesterday about James Bond, about Casino Royale.

1232
00:57:21,659 --> 00:57:24,021
So in Casino Royale, you kind of see

1233
00:57:25,082 --> 00:57:25,342
young...

1234
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:26,970
Daniel Craig.

1235
00:57:27,731 --> 00:57:31,273
You see young James Bond as this sort of reckless dude

1236
00:57:31,754 --> 00:57:34,836
who gets shaped through these difficult things

1237
00:57:34,856 --> 00:57:35,436
that he has to deal with,

1238
00:57:35,456 --> 00:57:37,258
these difficult choices that he has to make.

1239
00:57:37,878 --> 00:57:40,200
And he seems, I think, a lot more interesting

1240
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:41,621
as a character because of those choices.

1241
00:57:42,081 --> 00:57:44,323
So when we, instead of a character saying,

1242
00:57:44,363 --> 00:57:45,163
hey, here's a quest,

1243
00:57:45,724 --> 00:57:48,406
if they become more emotionally engaged and involved in that

1244
00:57:48,486 --> 00:57:49,727
and you become engaged with them,

1245
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,988
I think that reveals a lot more

1246
00:57:52,068 --> 00:57:53,189
interesting stuff about characters.

1247
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:54,650
One more?

1248
00:57:55,792 --> 00:57:56,473
Cool, last?

1249
00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:57,493
Nobody.

1250
00:57:58,134 --> 00:57:59,214
Hooray, we won, everybody.

1251
00:57:59,254 --> 00:57:59,755
We won.

1252
00:58:00,455 --> 00:58:00,856
Thank you.

1253
00:58:00,876 --> 00:58:08,180
So again, thank you all for coming.

1254
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,502
And don't forget to fill out the evaluation.

1255
00:58:10,742 --> 00:58:10,942
Thanks.
