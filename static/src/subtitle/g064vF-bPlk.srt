00:00:06,454 --> 00:00:10,836
Hi everybody, first of all welcome to this video presentation of our GDC talk.

2
00:00:10,836 --> 00:00:16,800
With everything that's going on we've decided that it would be better to give you this content

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,424
through a video, so thank you for watching. So we're going to talk about our experience as

4
00:00:22,424 --> 00:00:31,370
creative and business minds working on a game as a service title over the last four years of

5
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,292
our game Dead by Daylight and want to share some knowledge.

6
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,732
First of all, big disclaimer,

7
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:40,196
I just want to say that if you're looking at this video in the future,

8
00:00:40,196 --> 00:00:43,139
we might have changed our way to work because

9
00:00:43,139 --> 00:00:48,104
game as a service evolves rapidly and it can change quickly.

10
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:50,106
But part of it,

11
00:00:50,106 --> 00:00:53,590
namely the values that we're going to talk about,

12
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,374
are a solid and forever. Okay, let's start.

13
00:00:59,105 --> 00:01:03,506
All right, so first of all, I would like to take a moment for us to introduce ourselves

14
00:01:03,506 --> 00:01:07,168
so that we can give a little bit of credibility to the talk.

15
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:08,508
So I'm Dave Richard.

16
00:01:08,508 --> 00:01:11,769
I'm the creative director on Dead by Daylight.

17
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:16,511
I shipped a lot of games in my 20, almost 20 years in the industry.

18
00:01:16,511 --> 00:01:20,433
But most importantly, I worked four years on a game as a service title.

19
00:01:22,557 --> 00:01:29,664
And hello everyone, my name is Isabelle. I am the head of product strategy at Behaviour Interactive.

20
00:01:29,664 --> 00:01:36,090
I have over nine years of experience in product management, but more importantly,

21
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:36,851
I spent six years on live games.

22
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:41,856
All right, so just so that we're all on the same page, the game we're going to talk about

23
00:01:41,856 --> 00:01:45,660
is Dead by Daylight. It's a 4v1 multiplayer horror game.

24
00:01:46,247 --> 00:01:48,787
So four survivors are facing one killer.

25
00:01:48,787 --> 00:01:52,429
Killer is trying to kill and sacrifice all the survivors

26
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:54,829
to a giant entity that lives in the sky.

27
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:58,651
And the survivors are trying to escape

28
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,531
by repairing generators.

29
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:01,872
So that's the gist of it.

30
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,353
But more importantly is that over the four years

31
00:02:04,353 --> 00:02:07,694
of development, we've added a lot of content to the game.

32
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:11,315
A lot of characters, worlds, survivors, killers,

33
00:02:11,315 --> 00:02:12,295
and franchises.

34
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:14,276
And we've been called some sort of

35
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:19,076
Smash Brothers of horror games, like a real love letter to the horror genre.

36
00:02:19,076 --> 00:02:26,782
Some facts about Dead by Daylight. The game first launched in June 2016 on Steam.

37
00:02:26,782 --> 00:02:35,369
A year later, we launched on Xbox One and PS4. In 2019, we launched the Switch version as well

38
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:41,394
as the Windows Store version. Dead by Daylight is also available on mobile since April 2020.

39
00:02:44,454 --> 00:02:49,918
So today we want to talk about what we believe makes an effective game as a service.

40
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:57,443
We are going to share with you the lessons we learned from four years of life of Dead by Daylight.

41
00:02:57,443 --> 00:03:03,908
So first of all, what is needed to have a successful game as a service?

42
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:06,570
So first of all, it needs players.

43
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:10,692
You need to be able to entertain players, engage them and re-think them.

44
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:12,794
They need to feel good and have fun.

45
00:03:14,145 --> 00:03:18,527
And a game as a service also needs a recurring source of revenue

46
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:21,929
to support the game's development cost over the long run.

47
00:03:21,929 --> 00:03:29,392
Usually in the gaming world, we see these two components as direct opposites.

48
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:34,175
We have a fear of backlash, like for myself as a creative,

49
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:38,977
when we think about making money and monetization,

50
00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:41,098
we think of it as an evil feature.

51
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:43,039
Let's not put that in the game.

52
00:03:44,303 --> 00:03:53,692
And believe me, it's not always easy to be the person in charge of thinking about what monetization features we need to implement.

53
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:57,195
As Dave said, it's often seen as something a bit dirty.

54
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,999
But the thing is, if we don't make money, it's not going to work.

55
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:04,181
We need to make money to keep supporting the game's development costs.

56
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:11,463
And with too much focus on making money

57
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:15,144
and on the source of revenue, the players might leave

58
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:17,385
and without any players, the game is dead.

59
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:21,567
So spoiler alert, we have a live game

60
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:23,428
with microtransactions.

61
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:28,290
So we have an in-game store and we also have a battle pass.

62
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,292
And at the same time, over its four years of existence,

63
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:36,313
Dead by Daylight has seen over 20 million players

64
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:40,233
an average of 2.7 millions of monthly active users,

65
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:46,596
has consistently been in Steam's top 10 most played games since launch,

66
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:52,960
the dev team has also grown from around 30 devs at launch to around 200 devs today,

67
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,044
and Dead by Daylight is also the most streamed horror game on Twitch.

68
00:05:00,044 --> 00:05:03,166
For us, the key was really to understand that

69
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,908
entertaining players and making money aren't necessarily opposed.

70
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:12,435
We've put the conflicting elements on the side,

71
00:05:12,435 --> 00:05:15,696
and we realized that really these two facets

72
00:05:15,696 --> 00:05:18,578
of making the game would create a synergy.

73
00:05:18,578 --> 00:05:20,999
One would feed the other.

74
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:23,821
We realized that if we wanted to support the game

75
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:26,202
over the years with a source of revenue,

76
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:29,404
we would need to make the source of revenue

77
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:30,284
a joy for the players.

78
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:34,166
So the key here was to add monetization feature

79
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:37,009
that would add to the fun aspect of the game.

80
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:40,511
We did that with a lot of soul searching

81
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:46,536
and we sat down together and we found four core values

82
00:05:46,536 --> 00:05:49,077
that we would use anytime we would create

83
00:05:49,077 --> 00:05:51,419
a monetization feature in Dead by Daylight.

84
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,682
And these four values we are sure would work

85
00:05:54,682 --> 00:05:56,823
for any game as a service title.

86
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:00,486
They are valuableness, respect.

87
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,625
generosity and transparency.

88
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:09,509
Okay, so let's start with valuableness.

89
00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:13,392
What we mean by valuableness is three things.

90
00:06:13,392 --> 00:06:17,014
First, don't remove value to sell.

91
00:06:17,014 --> 00:06:21,918
Focus on quality versus quantity and enrich the game.

92
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:24,520
So if my goal is to make money,

93
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,882
the instinct would be to look at what players need the most

94
00:06:27,882 --> 00:06:29,123
and sell this thing, right?

95
00:06:29,735 --> 00:06:35,646
So if you need a sword to fight a monster, it's easy. I'll give your sword a durability so that

96
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:41,576
you have to buy a new one. And I'm even gonna make the sword more powerful. Easy money, right?

97
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:49,696
Well, we decided not to do this as firstly, this would make our game very expensive to play,

98
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:55,761
and secondly, it would make the game even pay to win in our case because you play against other

99
00:06:55,761 --> 00:07:00,445
players. It's important to make money, but not at the detriment of players having fun and the game's

100
00:07:00,445 --> 00:07:07,712
DNA. Ultimately, retention is at the heart of how well your monetization is doing. So the key

101
00:07:07,712 --> 00:07:10,334
takeaway here is don't remove value to sell.

102
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:14,812
There are other ways, like selling cosmetics for example.

103
00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:23,959
Cosmetics are optional, but players usually love them because it allows them to customize their beloved characters.

104
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:36,349
With monetization, if you don't know where to start, characters customization is the type of monetization feature that usually works well because it is additive of value.

105
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:39,752
So, we decided to sell cosmetic items in the store. Cool!

106
00:07:40,408 --> 00:07:44,170
Now, our next challenge was to fill the store with content.

107
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:50,253
We have tons of different killers and survivors, so let's create lots of color variations of our

108
00:07:50,253 --> 00:07:57,996
characters and also let's create tons of weapon skins. Maybe we could invest in tools that can

109
00:07:57,996 --> 00:08:02,398
automate this process. Filling the store that way would be super efficient.

110
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:08,116
Well, even if it might sound efficient to create cosmetics that way,

111
00:08:08,116 --> 00:08:14,359
we decided not to do this and to focus our efforts on creating very high-quality cosmetics

112
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:17,681
rather than focusing on quantity.

113
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:23,164
Why? Because we, devs, would love efficiency to equate efficacy,

114
00:08:23,164 --> 00:08:29,408
but with cosmetic items, what really matters for players is the quality, not the quantity.

115
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:37,389
So from our experience, WhatSells is not a store with tons of color options and a wide range of t-shirts,

116
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:39,290
but a store with high quality items.

117
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:46,354
And from our experience, what works for us is high quality cosmetics that sell a fantasy.

118
00:08:46,354 --> 00:08:52,097
They look way more interesting for our players as they allow them to express their personality.

119
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:55,920
Also, they are more fun to produce for our teams of artists.

120
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:03,094
The dream of playing a specific character is at the core of these cosmetics.

121
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:10,379
They have a strong fantasy that goes beyond gameplay purposes.

122
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:16,723
So being able to customize your character allows the player to express their own personality,

123
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:21,926
and it also allows them to play very specific roles, like specific characters that exist in

124
00:09:21,926 --> 00:09:26,229
franchises, for example, and that's super important and will

125
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:30,179
is adds a lot of value to the cosmetic.

126
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:34,582
They also enrich the game universe.

127
00:09:34,582 --> 00:09:36,664
They add variety to the game.

128
00:09:36,664 --> 00:09:38,866
They enrich the visual.

129
00:09:38,866 --> 00:09:40,707
The more cosmetic that we add to the game,

130
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:41,908
especially high-quality one,

131
00:09:41,908 --> 00:09:44,450
it means that you'll see

132
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,272
more differences in the game world every match you play.

133
00:09:47,272 --> 00:09:52,256
There's also something very special we do in DbD.

134
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:54,478
The cosmetics are not

135
00:09:55,064 --> 00:10:00,107
only just visually stunning, they also come with a story.

136
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:02,648
And it's a chance for us, it's a platform,

137
00:10:02,648 --> 00:10:04,649
to tell more stories about our character

138
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:08,131
and deepen the lore so that the players

139
00:10:08,131 --> 00:10:10,413
can know more about their favorite characters.

140
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:12,074
Obviously, there are some limits.

141
00:10:12,074 --> 00:10:18,817
We found our own limits because we're doing a horror game.

142
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:19,898
There's some.

143
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:25,416
things we have to refuse as cosmetic item,

144
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,379
even though we know they would be super popular

145
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:29,440
and they would sell well.

146
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,504
For example, we could have a demand

147
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:40,529
to make a grim killer looking aesthetic item for a survivor

148
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:41,390
and vice versa.

149
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,253
We could have like a very funny or sexy in this example.

150
00:10:45,793 --> 00:10:50,255
skins that are requested on our characters.

151
00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:52,095
This goes against immersion.

152
00:10:52,095 --> 00:10:53,176
When we see these skins,

153
00:10:53,176 --> 00:10:56,797
we might think that a lot of people would love them,

154
00:10:56,797 --> 00:10:58,438
but a lot of people would go into

155
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:01,178
a horror game expecting things to be horrific.

156
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:03,219
When this happens and it's funny,

157
00:11:03,219 --> 00:11:05,200
it breaks the immersion, it breaks the game.

158
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,941
So it doesn't add to the gameplay experience.

159
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:08,941
So it has to be a no.

160
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:12,742
Last year, we released

161
00:11:12,742 --> 00:11:14,803
a new feature to our game called the Archives.

162
00:11:15,262 --> 00:11:18,582
The archive is amazing because it was a dream that I had

163
00:11:18,582 --> 00:11:20,282
for a long time in the game,

164
00:11:20,282 --> 00:11:23,443
a platform to be able to tell even more stories,

165
00:11:23,443 --> 00:11:25,983
to show animatics and to show our characters

166
00:11:25,983 --> 00:11:30,224
in new ways that we didn't have in the game before.

167
00:11:30,224 --> 00:11:32,165
And also to add new objective to the game.

168
00:11:32,165 --> 00:11:33,685
Well, we had an issue with this feature

169
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:35,745
because it was super expensive

170
00:11:35,745 --> 00:11:38,746
and it was hard to support on the longterm.

171
00:11:38,746 --> 00:11:41,406
We knew on that on Isa's side,

172
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:43,707
they also wanted to add a battle pass to the game.

173
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:46,208
And so both of us, we thought, well,

174
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,369
this is the perfect opportunity,

175
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:49,190
because Isa also wanted to make sure

176
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,231
that the battle pass was not just a battle pass.

177
00:11:51,231 --> 00:11:55,614
So this is when we've created this amazing feature

178
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,355
that has both.

179
00:11:57,355 --> 00:12:02,378
So we've decided to add a lot of value to a battle pass.

180
00:12:02,378 --> 00:12:05,620
It offers more lore, more story.

181
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,401
It offers gameplay opportunities,

182
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:11,243
and it offers tons of rewards that are linked directly

183
00:12:11,243 --> 00:12:12,363
to the story that we're...

184
00:12:13,447 --> 00:12:15,508
we're putting forward in the archive.

185
00:12:15,508 --> 00:12:22,270
This strategy that we have to add lots of value to our monetization features has paid off.

186
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:28,691
Because we have in general one player out of five, sometimes more, sometimes less,

187
00:12:28,691 --> 00:12:33,833
but in general one out of five that spends money after the initial game purchase.

188
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,293
So this is very good. That works well for us.

189
00:12:37,604 --> 00:12:43,549
But something important to know is that creating outfits requires a significant investment.

190
00:12:43,549 --> 00:12:46,612
This is our skins production pipeline.

191
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:58,221
Making one single fantasy outfit involves easily 10 different disciplines and can easily take up to two months to be produced.

192
00:12:58,221 --> 00:13:00,763
And that's just for one skin.

193
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:05,567
Now you have to fill the store and if you have a battle pass, you have to fill the battle pass too.

194
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:11,812
And there is also a maintenance cost because you need to keep adding content regularly

195
00:13:11,812 --> 00:13:13,793
past features launch.

196
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,473
So this represents quite an investment.

197
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:19,094
And building the store itself is also an expensive feature.

198
00:13:19,094 --> 00:13:22,435
You have to build the entire UI just to be able to sell skins.

199
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:29,218
Then if you need bundles or a featured page or a discount section, it's even more work.

200
00:13:29,218 --> 00:13:35,560
And you also have all of the online services like the backend services for in-app purchases.

201
00:13:36,056 --> 00:13:41,798
the tooling for customer support, data tracking to understand how well you are doing, and so on.

202
00:13:41,798 --> 00:13:48,259
To sum up, it is more expensive to build and support when you're adding value to your game

203
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:53,161
through this feature, but it's totally worth it.

204
00:13:53,161 --> 00:13:57,662
At scale, a cosmetic-driven business model is very profitable.

205
00:13:57,662 --> 00:14:04,944
So second value is respect, and what we mean by that is

206
00:14:05,573 --> 00:14:08,054
to respect the player's taste,

207
00:14:08,054 --> 00:14:10,374
player's time, and the player's money.

208
00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:15,975
Let's start with respect their taste.

209
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:18,756
Let's take an example here.

210
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:21,016
We have two characters of DBD and

211
00:14:21,016 --> 00:14:24,657
we have their popularity ranked in the graphs.

212
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:26,378
You can see that Meg,

213
00:14:26,378 --> 00:14:30,238
the survivor is the top-played character and the clown

214
00:14:30,238 --> 00:14:34,279
is in the lowest percentage of character that is played.

215
00:14:35,502 --> 00:14:39,024
So the instinct here would be to leave the clown in the dust

216
00:14:39,024 --> 00:14:40,765
and not make outfits for him,

217
00:14:40,765 --> 00:14:43,326
and just focus on the characters that are more popular

218
00:14:43,326 --> 00:14:45,427
to make sure that they sell

219
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,768
and that we make tons of money, right?

220
00:14:47,768 --> 00:14:52,430
But no, this would be unrespectful.

221
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,071
So here's the way we wanna do it,

222
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:55,911
and that we do it right now.

223
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:59,153
So of course, the most played characters will have.

224
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:05,619
a lot of outfits. This is important because these characters you see them a lot in the game so you

225
00:15:05,619 --> 00:15:10,801
want more variety and you want to support more players with more choice so that everybody can

226
00:15:10,801 --> 00:15:18,785
be happy. But it also means that the underdogs will have outfits. It's important to support them.

227
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:24,607
It's important to support all of these little percentages of players and actually when we do

228
00:15:24,607 --> 00:15:27,989
this we sometimes see a surge of popularity for

229
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:35,083
the characters. So here's an example with the Wraith. Around Halloween last year, we've created

230
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:41,568
the Alibi collection, which is a series of very, very cool cosmetic with visual effect.

231
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:44,410
And we add this one on the rate, which is amazing.

232
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,932
And we can see in the graph that at the moment we release this outfit, the rate at a surge

233
00:15:48,932 --> 00:15:51,494
of popularity and that he would be played more.

234
00:15:51,494 --> 00:15:58,058
So this is a high value because respecting the taste of the player, giving access to

235
00:15:58,058 --> 00:16:02,961
this character will make the game more fun as you'll see more variety in gameplay as

236
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:03,181
well.

237
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:09,208
Another question we had to answer was

238
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,510
how much should our cosmetics cost?

239
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:15,692
Should we go with loot boxes or a fixed price?

240
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:18,234
The logic to maximize the price of an outfit

241
00:16:18,234 --> 00:16:20,315
would be to sell them through loot boxes.

242
00:16:20,315 --> 00:16:23,317
Loot boxes would allow us to have some of our outfits

243
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,799
valued at hundreds, even thousands of dollars

244
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:28,461
because we could make the odds of dropping

245
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:31,603
some cosmetics super, super small.

246
00:16:31,603 --> 00:16:32,623
Easy money, right?

247
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:38,332
Well, we decided not to sell loot boxes, but to offer an à la carte store instead,

248
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:47,079
even if it meant generating less revenue, because we find this model more respectful of our players' wallet.

249
00:16:47,079 --> 00:16:50,201
Players can purchase the outfits they want.

250
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:54,584
They can even purchase the individual piece of an outfit if they wish.

251
00:16:54,584 --> 00:17:02,390
And we also wanted our cool cosmetics to be accessible to the many, even to the smaller spenders.

252
00:17:03,237 --> 00:17:09,861
In Dead by Daylight, there are four tiers of outfits from common to very rare.

253
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:12,823
Our outfits cost from $1.2 to an average of $10.

254
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:19,228
And since players can purchase the pieces individually, our items

255
00:17:19,228 --> 00:17:19,928
actually go from 50 cents to $4.

256
00:17:19,928 --> 00:17:22,130
The other component is respect their time.

257
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,632
We talked about a battle pass earlier, right?

258
00:17:25,632 --> 00:17:30,555
So a battle pass system, you have to play to unlock.

259
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:37,274
tiers to be able to unlock some rewards. The more you play, the more you'll unlock. You can buy the

260
00:17:37,274 --> 00:17:43,438
tiers to unlock more content if you don't have the time to play for it. So an instinct here would be

261
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:51,544
that to optimize the revenue, we should make it a super long grind to be able to get everything.

262
00:17:51,544 --> 00:17:55,227
Easy money, again.

263
00:17:55,819 --> 00:18:06,522
But really, this is also wrong for us. It goes against respect of our player. So here's how we

264
00:18:06,522 --> 00:18:16,104
do it instead. So first of all, we use the data out of the playtime of the players to understand

265
00:18:16,613 --> 00:18:21,235
what's an average player in Dead by Daylight and how much time they have to spend on the game

266
00:18:21,235 --> 00:18:26,498
on average. So here the idea was not to push everybody to play more to be able to grind

267
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:33,941
everything. So we found out that an hour a day was the average for our players and so we made sure

268
00:18:33,941 --> 00:18:39,383
that the whole rift was accessible to everyone and that most players would be able to go through it

269
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:45,586
and unlock cool content. We've also took the decision to put some of the high-valued cosmetics

270
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:52,041
in the first years of the battle pass so that a lot of players would be able to get them.

271
00:18:52,041 --> 00:19:00,487
Let's talk about some of our learnings now. First, we did not see backlash when we introduced our

272
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:05,710
in-game store two years post-launch. Same for our battle pass introduced almost four years

273
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:10,173
post-launch. And for the few negative comments we could see on our socials,

274
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:16,469
We didn't even had time to react because we saw 10 times more players defending and supporting us.

275
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:22,452
And I think that when you design monetization respectfully, this is what you get.

276
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,953
You turn players into ambassadors.

277
00:19:24,953 --> 00:19:29,375
And for having worked on live games for quite some time now,

278
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:35,278
I can tell you that this is the position you always want to be in.

279
00:19:35,278 --> 00:19:40,020
And instead of fearing backlash, we actually saw lots of positive word of mouth.

280
00:19:41,234 --> 00:19:52,676
Every time a competitor does something that has to do with micro transactions that gets players angry, we see lots of players praising us.

281
00:19:52,676 --> 00:19:59,058
Also, having a respectful monetization design helps to get the buying from our dev team.

282
00:19:59,058 --> 00:20:07,780
As Dave said at the beginning of the presentation, it is very important that your dev team doesn't see monetization features as evil features.

283
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,463
So to sum up this value of respect,

284
00:20:12,463 --> 00:20:13,844
it may sound obvious,

285
00:20:13,844 --> 00:20:15,806
but you need to respect players of all types

286
00:20:15,806 --> 00:20:18,868
and you need to ease their chosen way

287
00:20:18,868 --> 00:20:20,590
to access what is fun in your game.

288
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,032
Next value is generosity.

289
00:20:23,032 --> 00:20:26,995
And what we mean by that is inclusiveness.

290
00:20:26,995 --> 00:20:31,019
So have the most player as possible

291
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:33,781
to experience what is fun in the game,

292
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:35,323
to have access of what is fun in the game.

293
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:39,286
And also it's to get more than your money's worth

294
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:44,651
when you do decide to buy something.

295
00:20:44,651 --> 00:20:48,134
We put our hearts and soul into these products

296
00:20:48,134 --> 00:20:49,835
that we're making.

297
00:20:49,835 --> 00:20:52,238
It costs a lot of money, a lot of resources,

298
00:20:52,238 --> 00:20:53,018
a lot of energy.

299
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:55,296
to create awesome content.

300
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:58,197
So the reflex here is to say that every gameplay,

301
00:20:58,197 --> 00:21:01,778
every concept, every model, every marketing bit

302
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:06,500
that we need to do should bring back profit.

303
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,141
So we should put a price tag on everything.

304
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:13,503
And so we would make the most money as possible.

305
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:18,686
But this is not a good way to do it for us.

306
00:21:18,686 --> 00:21:20,947
We've decided to do things otherwise.

307
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:24,426
And we've decided to be more generous

308
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:31,628
So here's you can see on the right is a near distant shard and that's our soft currency. It's a currency that you can

309
00:21:31,628 --> 00:21:38,230
Grind through the game. So just by playing you unlock this currency and it allows you to unlock and

310
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,670
Play all of our original characters

311
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:46,272
Also 60 to 70 percent of our store is

312
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:50,053
unlockable with the soft currency

313
00:21:51,871 --> 00:21:54,993
So this is great because for the characters, for example,

314
00:21:54,993 --> 00:22:00,675
a player that decides to not spend a dime and just play the game,

315
00:22:00,675 --> 00:22:02,816
will eventually unlock new characters,

316
00:22:02,816 --> 00:22:05,098
which will add to his experience,

317
00:22:05,098 --> 00:22:07,899
but it will also add to the other player's experience

318
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:09,620
because it will add variety to the game.

319
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,742
So it just makes for a more healthy experience in the game.

320
00:22:14,742 --> 00:22:19,985
For the skins, we find out that as a reward,

321
00:22:20,517 --> 00:22:24,438
for your play time, unlocking a skin and be able to show it off

322
00:22:24,438 --> 00:22:30,980
is very meaningful to players.

323
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:36,362
Now when it comes to the battle pass, we apply the same value, generosity.

324
00:22:36,362 --> 00:22:39,163
So our battle pass contains 70 chills, 70 levels.

325
00:22:39,163 --> 00:22:44,184
And I remember having this discussion with Dave that

326
00:22:44,184 --> 00:22:46,985
70 rewards, it's a lot of content to produce.

327
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:55,391
So our instinct was to either raise the price of the battle pass or just fill it with rubbish.

328
00:22:55,391 --> 00:23:02,052
But we felt that both solutions were unacceptable for us. So we decided to sell the battle pass at

329
00:23:02,052 --> 00:23:07,534
$10 and be generous with the content that is included in the battle pass even if,

330
00:23:07,534 --> 00:23:14,815
monetarily speaking, it made no sense. The bet here was to get players excited and bet on retention too.

331
00:23:14,815 --> 00:23:17,016
So we are not saying that

332
00:23:17,423 --> 00:23:25,769
Our 70 tiers of rewards only contain awesome rewards, but for $10 players can earn over $200 worth of content.

333
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:35,997
If they finish the battle pass, they also can get their $10 back since $10 worth of Oryx cells, our hard currency, are included in the battle pass.

334
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:43,963
And for the players who do not wish to spend, by simply playing the game regularly, they can get over $35 worth of value.

335
00:23:47,836 --> 00:23:56,299
Also another choice that we've made is that there's no pressure to play the Archive and

336
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:58,519
to unlock things in the Battle Pass.

337
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:04,641
All the challenges, so the gameplay that comes along with a tome in the Archive, all the

338
00:24:04,641 --> 00:24:09,303
narrative assets are available for everyone forever.

339
00:24:09,303 --> 00:24:15,365
So even the new player that comes in has 20-30 hours of free content that's available.

340
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:19,686
for each archive that we release.

341
00:24:19,686 --> 00:24:23,427
Learnings out of this value of generosity.

342
00:24:23,427 --> 00:24:25,088
First of all, is that it's clear for

343
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,829
us that it leads to increased play time.

344
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:30,410
We can see here that in the graph,

345
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,631
as soon as the store launched,

346
00:24:31,631 --> 00:24:35,172
the average session duration went up.

347
00:24:35,172 --> 00:24:37,413
People play more, they want to get that currency,

348
00:24:37,413 --> 00:24:39,054
they want to unlock cosmetics.

349
00:24:39,054 --> 00:24:44,396
This second graph is also super interesting because we can see

350
00:24:44,396 --> 00:24:45,317
that in the weeks.

351
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:50,270
before and the weeks after the battle pass,

352
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,353
and of course, during the battle pass as well,

353
00:24:53,353 --> 00:24:56,915
the average session duration also went up.

354
00:24:56,915 --> 00:24:58,997
So people are playing more

355
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,879
to unlock the content of the archive.

356
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:04,541
Seriously, there's not a lot of features that,

357
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:06,603
I mean, monetized or not,

358
00:25:06,603 --> 00:25:10,146
that is able to generate such an impact on engagement.

359
00:25:13,157 --> 00:25:20,220
Making characters accessible encourage a better meta and diversity.

360
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:29,223
So the fact that the players are able to unlock freely the characters is super healthy for the type of game that we're doing.

361
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:35,066
Another learning, allowing players to unlock content with playtime is also good for revenue.

362
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:41,468
We know that players playing with more characters buy more skins, and this goes up exponentially.

363
00:25:42,258 --> 00:25:46,700
It is logic. Characters are a platform for cosmetics.

364
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,702
So in other words, our revenue goes up with the amount of characters owned,

365
00:25:51,702 --> 00:25:56,544
so facilitating the access to characters was the right bet for us.

366
00:25:56,544 --> 00:26:04,107
Our Battle Pass, when it is active, generates an average of 20% incremental daily average revenue per user overall.

367
00:26:04,107 --> 00:26:10,410
So in addition to seeing players play more, players also end up spending more.

368
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:14,181
So Arbed was right about the battle pass.

369
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:19,166
Generosity led to incremental revenue and play time.

370
00:26:19,166 --> 00:26:21,448
So to sum up, be generous,

371
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:24,871
make sure that all sorts of players, monetizing or not,

372
00:26:24,871 --> 00:26:28,474
are included in the whole game

373
00:26:28,474 --> 00:26:29,995
and that they are happy and engaged.

374
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:36,879
because at the end, what you will end up having is a very virtuous loop.

375
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:39,840
I remember us looking at each other with Dave,

376
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,241
and when we saw the result, we felt very happy

377
00:26:43,241 --> 00:26:45,982
because players that are happy will stay longer

378
00:26:45,982 --> 00:26:48,083
and will eventually monetize,

379
00:26:48,083 --> 00:26:51,844
and players who monetize are even more engaged and stay longer in the game.

380
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:53,444
So it's really perfect.

381
00:26:53,444 --> 00:26:58,146
So now let's talk about our fourth value, transparency.

382
00:26:58,146 --> 00:26:59,726
So what does it mean for us?

383
00:26:59,726 --> 00:27:02,027
First, communicate your intent.

384
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:06,433
Always explain why and acknowledge your mistakes.

385
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:08,274
So if we go back two years in time,

386
00:27:08,274 --> 00:27:09,695
I remember Dave and I wondering

387
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:13,138
how to communicate our store to our players.

388
00:27:13,138 --> 00:27:16,580
We were a bit honestly frightened by that.

389
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:20,343
But what we did is that we wrote a blog post

390
00:27:20,343 --> 00:27:23,286
titled our store philosophies

391
00:27:23,286 --> 00:27:24,927
that we shared with our community

392
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:27,829
before the store even came out.

393
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:29,490
We basically explained to them

394
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,393
almost everything we explained to you in this GDC talk.

395
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:35,992
Very transparently, we detailed our store pillars,

396
00:27:35,992 --> 00:27:38,993
how our currencies work, and how much everything costs.

397
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:42,295
And above all, we explained to our players

398
00:27:42,295 --> 00:27:44,756
why we introduced Assore.

399
00:27:44,756 --> 00:27:48,898
Our in-game store was presented at the same time

400
00:27:48,898 --> 00:27:51,559
as Dead by Daylight's Year 3 roadmap.

401
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:54,080
So allow me to read a section of our blog post to you.

402
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,571
We are very excited to start Dead by Daylight Year 3 with you

403
00:27:58,571 --> 00:28:01,532
and want you to know that the launch of Chapter 8 in June

404
00:28:01,532 --> 00:28:04,312
is just the beginning of what we want to do.

405
00:28:04,312 --> 00:28:08,213
We believe that this game will have more anniversaries to celebrate

406
00:28:08,213 --> 00:28:10,294
and we are eager to continue to support the game

407
00:28:10,294 --> 00:28:12,374
as the Dead by Daylight community grows.

408
00:28:12,374 --> 00:28:15,875
We would like to give an early thank you

409
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:18,756
to all the players who will be buying cosmetic items

410
00:28:18,756 --> 00:28:22,897
as this is what will allow us to support our ambitions for the future.

411
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:28,180
So if you intend to add microtransactions in your game,

412
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:32,283
telling players why you need them is super important.

413
00:28:32,283 --> 00:28:33,765
When players buy a cosmetic item,

414
00:28:33,765 --> 00:28:37,788
they invest in the game and the dev team.

415
00:28:37,788 --> 00:28:39,669
For Dead by Daylight players,

416
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:41,911
the introduction of an in-game store

417
00:28:41,911 --> 00:28:45,014
had in some ways become a promise of a future

418
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:46,915
for the development of the game.

419
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:52,753
And what worked well for us, and I think is really important,

420
00:28:52,753 --> 00:28:55,456
is that you have to do this communication with your own voice.

421
00:28:55,456 --> 00:28:57,637
You need to be super candid about it.

422
00:28:57,637 --> 00:29:00,460
And when we did it, we had a live stream,

423
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:04,523
but before that, we had a pre-recorded video made as well.

424
00:29:04,523 --> 00:29:08,646
And this was pretty cool because we had to work with the whole team

425
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:10,508
to show these values and to show this plan,

426
00:29:10,508 --> 00:29:14,111
and we saw that they would get on board with what we were saying.

427
00:29:14,484 --> 00:29:17,406
So we knew at this point that it was going to work.

428
00:29:17,406 --> 00:29:19,327
If you can get your team on board 100%,

429
00:29:19,327 --> 00:29:24,290
it's gonna be far more easier than to get your community

430
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,891
to understand what's going on.

431
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:29,934
So in this process, as we said,

432
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,896
we've also presented our year three roadmap.

433
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,757
And it was a great exercise.

434
00:29:34,757 --> 00:29:36,778
We'd like to take some time to talk about

435
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:38,720
some of the learning that we got from sharing

436
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,461
our year three roadmap with our community.

437
00:29:41,245 --> 00:29:46,567
So we showed to our players one year of content, including new killers, new survival of the maps,

438
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:50,650
as well as some changes and priorities we wanted to tackle.

439
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:56,072
So showing your plans long in advance helps to get players excited about what's coming,

440
00:29:56,072 --> 00:30:02,075
even if it is not live yet. For example, we told our players in advance that we would reinforce

441
00:30:02,075 --> 00:30:07,578
our anti-cheat system, and even if it got released several months later,

442
00:30:07,578 --> 00:30:10,420
knowing it was coming helped to keep our players patient.

443
00:30:11,873 --> 00:30:19,619
More generally, it was the first time we told our community that we would keep supporting the game for years to come.

444
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:26,905
And as a player, or even as a streamer, it sends a strong message that they can keep investing their time and money in our game

445
00:30:26,905 --> 00:30:31,328
because we, devs, are committed to keep investing in it as well.

446
00:30:31,328 --> 00:30:36,832
After all, why would we expect a player to commit his or her time and money in our game

447
00:30:36,832 --> 00:30:40,275
if we don't ourselves commit to keep investing in the game too?

448
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,863
It can also help to structure production as it forces the dev team to think about the future.

449
00:30:45,863 --> 00:30:52,927
It forces us to think about what priorities we want to tackle next, which also makes us work in the right order.

450
00:30:52,927 --> 00:30:58,710
And having some dates laid out in the future also allows us to retro-plan every phase of production,

451
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:07,755
from design kick-off to official release, including dedicated time for QA and dedicated time for live testing on our public test environment, for example.

452
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,361
So having a roadmap has many advantages.

453
00:31:11,361 --> 00:31:14,483
But this is definitely not for everyone.

454
00:31:14,483 --> 00:31:16,985
It might be more difficult for smaller studios

455
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:20,607
or for a game that's not live yet.

456
00:31:20,607 --> 00:31:22,849
Because yeah, when you're communicating this roadmap

457
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:25,571
through the whole world, you're committing to the content

458
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:26,271
you're promising.

459
00:31:26,271 --> 00:31:29,113
Also, you're creating expectation.

460
00:31:29,113 --> 00:31:32,836
If you are not delivering on the content you've promised,

461
00:31:32,836 --> 00:31:35,698
of course, you're going to disappoint your community.

462
00:31:35,698 --> 00:31:37,559
You're going to have to deal with that later.

463
00:31:38,348 --> 00:31:41,410
A word of advice here, the best thing is to stay high level

464
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,552
when you're communicating about your roadmap,

465
00:31:43,552 --> 00:31:45,754
so that you don't create too much expectation.

466
00:31:45,754 --> 00:31:49,097
And also make sure that you tell your community

467
00:31:49,097 --> 00:31:50,518
that these things might change.

468
00:31:50,518 --> 00:31:55,202
Communicating your roadmap also creates a precedent.

469
00:31:55,202 --> 00:31:58,926
Every year when you present your new roadmap,

470
00:31:58,926 --> 00:32:03,229
there's gonna be a want that this roadmap

471
00:32:03,229 --> 00:32:05,491
is more awesome than the previous one.

472
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:08,741
So that gets increasingly more difficult.

473
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:13,664
And of course it can't be, it cannot be bigger and bigger and

474
00:32:13,664 --> 00:32:16,186
more impressive every other year.

475
00:32:16,186 --> 00:32:21,270
So what's important here again, is to explain to your community why it is like that.

476
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:24,853
Sometime you have a technical debt that you need to fix.

477
00:32:24,853 --> 00:32:28,275
Sometime you need to do other type of investment in your

478
00:32:28,275 --> 00:32:30,777
product for the longer term.

479
00:32:30,777 --> 00:32:30,857
So.

480
00:32:31,828 --> 00:32:34,929
That way, you can make sure that the player understands what's going on,

481
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:37,350
and then can get hyped about a better future.

482
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:44,174
So to sum it up, communicate your intention with candor,

483
00:32:44,174 --> 00:32:48,396
do it with your own voice, and transform your players into investors.

484
00:32:48,396 --> 00:32:52,458
As soon as they get it and that they want your game to succeed,

485
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:55,879
as much as you do, they'll become colleagues, they'll become investors.

486
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:59,541
So, time to wrap up.

487
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:05,048
So like we explained at the beginning, to have a successful game as a service,

488
00:33:05,048 --> 00:33:11,052
you need players that feel good about your game, that are having fun,

489
00:33:11,052 --> 00:33:15,775
and you need a sustainable source of revenue so that you can keep doing

490
00:33:15,775 --> 00:33:20,439
amazing content. And often these two components, when making a feature,

491
00:33:20,439 --> 00:33:22,220
they're seen as conflictual.

492
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:26,723
By building monetization features with these four values in mind,

493
00:33:26,723 --> 00:33:29,625
we found out that we could make purchasing a joy.

494
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:34,338
We found out that building fun features to entertain players

495
00:33:34,338 --> 00:33:36,658
and building monetization features

496
00:33:36,658 --> 00:33:41,799
to have a sustainable source of revenue can be the same thing.

497
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:45,640
They can fuel each other and become synergistic.

498
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,761
To say it another way, a player who's

499
00:33:47,761 --> 00:33:51,961
having fun and is entertaining is hooked for the long term.

500
00:33:51,961 --> 00:33:53,602
The player becomes a colleague.

501
00:33:53,602 --> 00:33:55,802
He works with you to make the game better.

502
00:33:56,844 --> 00:34:00,387
And eventually, they can become investors.

503
00:34:00,387 --> 00:34:04,170
They will want to give you access to this power

504
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,612
to be able to build even more awesome features for the game.

505
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:13,436
And when spending is a joy, when monetization enriches

506
00:34:13,436 --> 00:34:16,339
a game experience, and when the store becomes

507
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:19,001
a promise of a future for the game,

508
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:21,002
we have a virtuous loop where.

509
00:34:21,558 --> 00:34:26,581
Monetization generates engagement and engagement leads to monetization.

510
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:36,907
Before ending this talk, we wanted to address a last question that we thought might be useful to all the creative and business minds out there.

511
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:42,389
If we had done things differently, would we have made more money?

512
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:46,191
Well, it is hard to say because.

513
00:34:46,915 --> 00:34:51,118
it would have required us to do an A-B test to release the game with two different business

514
00:34:51,118 --> 00:34:57,461
models at the same time. But what we can say is that we are happy with the choices we made

515
00:34:57,461 --> 00:35:02,985
because our players are very engaged and our player base hasn't stopped growing since launch.

516
00:35:02,985 --> 00:35:09,708
We are profitable and the money we generate has allowed us to keep investing in the game.

517
00:35:12,042 --> 00:35:20,008
Our values are important to our devs, which we believe has a positive impact on our employees' acquisition and retention.

518
00:35:20,008 --> 00:35:35,820
And finally, we believe that our brand image towards our players is also positively impacted, which is great to acquire new players, whether it's for Dead by Daylight or even for our future games in development and behavior.

519
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,501
Thank you very much.

520
00:35:40,963 --> 00:35:41,807
I hope you enjoyed the talk.

521
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:43,797
Thank you.

522
00:35:43,797 --> 00:35:44,038
Bye.
