1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:05,991
My name is Daniel Perry.

2
00:00:07,952 --> 00:00:13,757
I am the emperor of sound waves, aka the audio director at Alchemy Labs.

3
00:00:16,504 --> 00:00:20,848
And welcome to the talk about bringing VR experiences to life with the magic of music.

4
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:25,152
I know it's a mouthful and a long talk name.

5
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:29,176
I hope to fill your expectations with this talk.

6
00:00:30,638 --> 00:00:35,523
At Alchemy Labs, we worked on Job Simulator, Rick and Morty Virtual Reality,

7
00:00:35,663 --> 00:00:37,985
as well as the recently released Vacation Simulator.

8
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:44,709
And this talk, I decided to divide this talk specifically into four sections.

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:53,914
The music system requirements that you may want to consider when you're creating your new experience for VR.

10
00:00:54,515 --> 00:01:00,878
I'm focusing on VR specifically. A lot of it can be translated to some specific AR segments.

11
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:03,460
So, consider that as like...

12
00:01:04,623 --> 00:01:06,625
because I know we're in a mixed reality conference.

13
00:01:07,746 --> 00:01:09,447
Okay, so music system requirements,

14
00:01:09,788 --> 00:01:11,649
music driven by VR specific data,

15
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,812
enhancing game elements with musicality

16
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:20,017
and creating music instruments in VR, like.

17
00:01:20,557 --> 00:01:26,439
The talk itself will have a lot of examples.

18
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:30,580
We're listening to this talk through mono, unfortunately,

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,901
so some of the specialization will be lost.

20
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:41,483
But I think the examples will still be able to give you a good idea of what we've accomplished with those examples.

21
00:01:42,524 --> 00:01:45,225
And the talk is about inspiration, mainly, so there's no...

22
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:54,153
The code involved or things like that is just about the ideas that you may want to consider when you're working on your new experience.

23
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:03,045
So, let's start with music system requirements. First thing, when you're thinking about your music,

24
00:02:03,946 --> 00:02:11,549
would you want to make it diegetic or non-diegetic? Diegetic meaning emanating or coming from an

25
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:15,091
object that exists in the real world rather than the

26
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,025
2D ethereal music that no one can actually see and spatialize properly.

27
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:29,574
I think VR specifically lends very strongly to the diegetic approach and at Alchemy Labs

28
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:35,561
we specifically focus on the diegetic.

29
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:44,811
utilizing diegetic music as our main thing, but that being said, we never take things for granted.

30
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:52,434
We have explored and in our experiences we do use the combination of both, so making a system that supports both will be very helpful.

31
00:02:53,875 --> 00:03:02,580
So we know that VR specifically is consumed by our users by stereo, not mono, stereo headphones.

32
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,643
However, because of spatialization, we have a really cool ability to...

33
00:03:10,404 --> 00:03:17,346
create more than just the stereo sound coming out of our space of our headphones we can utilize

34
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:23,148
mono sounds that are emanating from specific areas in the 3d field

35
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:27,189
And in this case, I mean I wrote mono stereo surround and stems

36
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:33,871
But basically those are old concepts in VR specifically we were thinking about everything as multi mono

37
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:39,472
um meaning even if I have a stereo file we basically I basically would want to separate

38
00:03:39,492 --> 00:03:44,839
that into like two monos and place them in the virtual environment in a way that

39
00:03:45,179 --> 00:03:51,688
makes sense to my experience um and because uh like VR is such a cool um

40
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:58,194
If you want to get more detailed experience, we can definitely utilize weird setups.

41
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:05,256
The concept of surround doesn't really translate to VR, because I can create as many audio

42
00:04:05,276 --> 00:04:10,677
sources of those mono sources as I want and place them wherever I want, so I'm not bound

43
00:04:10,697 --> 00:04:14,498
to 5.1 with the .1 being the sub, or things like that.

44
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:19,620
So that's definitely something to make sure that your music system supports.

45
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:24,784
And the last thing is making it responsive and interactive.

46
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:38,597
Obviously, all of those requirements, those are not requirements, those are more like, or if you have them in your experience, you will definitely be enhancing your experience significantly.

47
00:04:39,338 --> 00:04:43,680
So, like specialization, no, specialization is mandatory.

48
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,403
Directionality or directivity is, if you're thinking about a speaker, there's a cone of how the audio outputs from it.

49
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,104
And when the listener listens to the audio, it's a cone of how the audio is coming out of the speaker.

50
00:04:53,124 --> 00:04:56,165
So, if you're thinking about a speaker, there's a cone of how the audio outputs from it.

51
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:02,029
From a different angle of that cone, some of the sounds will be filtered accordingly.

52
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,212
And that's what directionality means, occlusion behind walls and things like that.

53
00:05:07,253 --> 00:05:13,517
And costume attenuation, since we are addressing a virtual environment,

54
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:22,883
we are not bound to the physics or the way the normal physical world would emanate sound and attenuate it.

55
00:05:23,707 --> 00:05:28,290
And we definitely want to utilize that to properly mix the experience.

56
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:38,715
So, unlike a keyboard and mouse experience, the music system has to support all of those to be able to properly mix in the environment.

57
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:40,896
What you see here...

58
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:47,129
is a top-down picture of the beach in Vacation Simulator right here.

59
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:57,656
The black circles depict where the player can land. We have very specific interaction areas

60
00:05:57,716 --> 00:06:01,358
where the player can be at, so the player can't just move around to wherever they want. They have

61
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,862
it's a room-scale experience, but these are the rooms that the player can be in. The red circle

62
00:06:06,922 --> 00:06:09,684
here, and if you can see here, the tower,

63
00:06:11,385 --> 00:06:18,808
This is where the speakers are placed. Again, because we subscribe to the diegetic experience,

64
00:06:19,348 --> 00:06:24,610
we definitely wanted to have the speakers located somewhere so that they can emanate from,

65
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,791
but it had to be a very

66
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:32,042
where the player can see visually where it's coming from

67
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:35,846
so that the specialization is not wasted on an environment

68
00:06:35,906 --> 00:06:37,988
that the player can't make sense out of.

69
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,072
But that also brought the other interesting things

70
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:44,574
like the directivity or directionality

71
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:46,677
because the player can land behind.

72
00:06:47,677 --> 00:06:53,782
uh the speakers and uh the occlusion where the player can actually land inside the um the dock

73
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:59,426
shop in this case uh let's see a short video of uh all those elements come into play

74
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:09,594
so you hear how the it's filtered right now open

75
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:22,036
Oops, coming right up!

76
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:49,625
So other than the occlusion and the directionality,

77
00:07:49,665 --> 00:07:51,666
the other thing that existed in this example

78
00:07:51,726 --> 00:07:53,907
was the responsiveness of the music system,

79
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:56,169
because it starts from those speakers

80
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,230
that are behind the player,

81
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,932
but when the player gets to interact with the sports,

82
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:05,615
the music has a subtle, it disappears subtly,

83
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:07,857
and then the next music is actually coming

84
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:08,977
from the new experience,

85
00:08:08,997 --> 00:08:11,039
so the direction of the music.

86
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:16,748
is different in this case, and the music system had to support that specifically.

87
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:22,591
This is another example from Rick and Morty Virtual Recallity from the San Diego Comic-Con

88
00:08:22,631 --> 00:08:22,931
demo.

89
00:08:23,692 --> 00:08:31,776
This was only shown to a small amount of audience, only the Comic-Con participants, so you can't

90
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:32,837
experience it outside.

91
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:36,019
It's a five-minute or ten-minute demo where...

92
00:08:38,523 --> 00:08:43,867
At the end of it, the player goes through the portal and into space, basically.

93
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:50,131
And there, I wanted to create an environment that feels grandiose and giant and interesting.

94
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:58,097
And for that, I utilized a multi-mono 6-channel that are kind of in a circle around the player.

95
00:08:59,158 --> 00:09:03,701
So that it's not just stereo coming out of the headphones as an ethereal thing,

96
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:06,984
but still, it's non-diegetic.

97
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:12,507
But it still gives the player the ability to look around and kind of sense

98
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:15,849
how I decided to mix the different instruments in this environment.

99
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:16,790
So check this out.

100
00:09:38,888 --> 00:09:40,749
It's a game through the portal.

101
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:43,749
Yeah, you gotta get out of here quick!

102
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,250
That's right, we're making a VR game!

103
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,071
Ha ha! Wubba lubba dub dub!

104
00:09:51,531 --> 00:09:54,971
We're doing a regular futuristic, old-timey VR game.

105
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:57,432
The 100 years Rick and Morty VR games.

106
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,652
100 years, we're all gonna die, Morty.

107
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,913
We're all gonna die in 100 years, don't you get it?

108
00:10:02,873 --> 00:10:03,533
Calm down, Rick!

109
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,533
You're gonna frighten people off!

110
00:10:06,969 --> 00:10:09,731
Shut up Morty, you don't know nothing about my VR system.

111
00:10:10,132 --> 00:10:11,373
I'm making a VR system.

112
00:10:12,073 --> 00:10:13,775
You're gonna live in your headset.

113
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:16,216
You're gonna die in your headset.

114
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:19,219
You go away with your little thumb sticks.

115
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,852
Rick is a big advocate for VR, if you didn't know.

116
00:10:28,593 --> 00:10:33,256
Yeah, so that's another example. Again, Alchemy does design with non-diegetic as well.

117
00:10:33,296 --> 00:10:37,699
It depends on the experiences that you want to create for your player.

118
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,323
But I would definitely urge keeping it in mind when you're prototyping

119
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:45,064
and when you're thinking about designing your system.

120
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:49,887
Music driven by VR specific input data.

121
00:10:49,927 --> 00:10:52,128
So, first thing, what can we use?

122
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:57,251
The nice thing about VR is that it lends into getting a lot more information.

123
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:05,895
So, we can utilize head rotation, position, gaze direction, hand rotation, position, point,

124
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:07,056
and interaction.

125
00:11:08,732 --> 00:11:13,314
Different gestures potentially can also trigger music changes if you'd like.

126
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:20,397
Because VR is a virtual world we try to simulate physics a lot.

127
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:23,198
Usually most of the experience are physics based experience.

128
00:11:23,738 --> 00:11:30,041
It would be great to utilize the physics information to drive music as well.

129
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:34,363
There are a lot of opportunities there that can and should be used

130
00:11:34,803 --> 00:11:36,844
when you're prototyping and creating your experiences.

131
00:11:37,502 --> 00:11:43,565
Considering how to do music and literally everything because of that.

132
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:51,649
That's game mechanics, that's objects position in the 3D world and so on and so forth.

133
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,872
I want to show a quick video from an early prototype of Vacation Simulator

134
00:11:57,932 --> 00:12:04,916
where again we used non-diegetic music stereo to drive a surprise factor in gameplay.

135
00:12:05,596 --> 00:12:06,157
Let's just check it out.

136
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:22,786
I'm not sure what the meaning of this is.

137
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,007
I don't know.

138
00:12:24,027 --> 00:12:25,189
I don't know.

139
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:26,670
I don't know.

140
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:29,153
I don't know.

141
00:12:29,273 --> 00:12:29,954
I don't know.

142
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:32,997
I don't know.

143
00:12:33,097 --> 00:12:34,238
I don't know.

144
00:13:03,331 --> 00:13:14,305
So obviously lighthearted humor with the power of music, very easily achieved and enhanced, utilizing the head rotation data.

145
00:13:16,888 --> 00:13:25,311
Here's another example of a prototype that I've done in the weekend so you'll recognize the steam hands in there and all that.

146
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:32,253
This is a very basic educational game that has buckets and it's an addition.

147
00:13:32,293 --> 00:13:39,655
You put the cubes in the buckets and in this case I'm utilizing music to gauge success.

148
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,376
So there are two things that are happening.

149
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,857
Actually let's look at it and then I'll talk about it a little bit.

150
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:27,622
Okay, very simply used, again this is a prototype.

151
00:14:30,024 --> 00:14:32,327
There are two really cool things that are happening here.

152
00:14:32,347 --> 00:14:37,092
A, the music helps the player understand if they're doing right or wrong and then

153
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:42,477
the farther away they are from like achieving their goal the music just sounds bad.

154
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:45,961
I could have gone with more extreme but that was the...

155
00:14:47,105 --> 00:14:51,167
The concept of trying to prove how far you need to go to make it extreme.

156
00:14:51,187 --> 00:14:55,988
But the other really cool thing is a game interaction or a way to interact with the

157
00:14:56,048 --> 00:15:02,190
world that you cannot really do with a conventional game, and that is to use your head to create

158
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:02,991
focal points.

159
00:15:06,012 --> 00:15:08,972
For example, in this case, you looked at one bowl.

160
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:12,834
It cleared off all the sounds from all the other elements,

161
00:15:12,874 --> 00:15:15,456
and the only thing you were hearing is the sound of the ball.

162
00:15:15,476 --> 00:15:20,339
That was why the music transitioned while the player was looking to the right,

163
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:23,120
to the music of the ball to the right.

164
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:29,564
And I think it lends to another cool game mechanic that I would definitely encourage to explore,

165
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:36,728
which is utilizing a stethoscope or a microphone to point at different areas of the world.

166
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:42,110
to focus on those specific areas.

167
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:48,732
Enhancing game elements with musicality.

168
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:54,593
By that I mean turning objects in your world into musical instruments.

169
00:15:56,844 --> 00:15:58,505
Why would we even want to bother?

170
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:05,128
We've got a, well, first thing, it can be a determining variable

171
00:16:05,308 --> 00:16:07,149
in the viability of the design itself.

172
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:12,052
Meaning, in the prototype stage, when you first create your object,

173
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,153
and we'll see an example later on.

174
00:16:15,854 --> 00:16:28,502
You may want to toss away your prototype just because you haven't experimented yet with the additional factor which is the sound and music, musicality in some cases.

175
00:16:30,183 --> 00:16:34,406
If you, if you add the musical elements into it you can

176
00:16:35,768 --> 00:16:39,912
add life to the environment and bring more feedback and responsiveness,

177
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,834
because after all VR is a...

178
00:16:42,275 --> 00:16:46,338
like if you do it right it's a very responsive environment and should react

179
00:16:46,899 --> 00:16:52,505
to anything you do, whether it's surprisingly or in a measured way.

180
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:58,489
It offers a creative outlet for the player who are after all here just to have fun.

181
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:03,012
And it can strengthen the emotional atmosphere of the scene.

182
00:17:03,092 --> 00:17:15,881
For example, if you're doing a bike experience, you'd be able to have an object that has an electric guitar sound coming out of it as a menu, for example.

183
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,444
What are the things that you may want to consider when you're doing something like this?

184
00:17:21,484 --> 00:17:30,376
And again, I feel like I'm talking to the right crowd here, because specifically, I don't want to talk to the audio people, to the audio department.

185
00:17:30,537 --> 00:17:34,502
I want to talk to the designers, to the people who are creating the experiences.

186
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:37,706
Stay. I'm kidding.

187
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:46,692
Just because these are things that need to be considered early on and prototyped on

188
00:17:46,752 --> 00:17:51,014
because they can make a significant difference in your experience.

189
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:57,458
So, okay, so things to consider are a potential problem between the background music and that element.

190
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:04,202
Scale of that element does not fit the background music. You might create kind of a cacophony. So instead of creating something that

191
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:12,506
Would be comfortable for the player to listen to you actually are making the opposite just on specific chords. So that's something to consider

192
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:18,750
You want to choose the right scale and harmony. That's again. That's on the musician, but but still

193
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,492
It's something that you know, you can demand for example

194
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:24,793
The

195
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:33,357
If you have a Middle Eastern experience, you can go with a harmonic minor scale, and it will sound a little more to that genre.

196
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:34,777
I will lend to it a little bit better.

197
00:18:34,797 --> 00:18:39,739
And then you want to design around the UI. So because we are, again,

198
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,382
VR is a very interactive experience. You have

199
00:18:46,202 --> 00:18:54,548
Buttons and knobs and levers and they all respond in a very different way sometimes stretchy objects that you may want to turn musical

200
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:59,092
So there's there's a lot of challenging there in the implementation as well

201
00:19:00,293 --> 00:19:03,555
That you may want to consider early on because those are

202
00:19:04,636 --> 00:19:08,238
Implementation this this is basically audio

203
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:08,919
audio

204
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,180
physics system

205
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:17,248
Which is not obvious in any system that was created.

206
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:21,553
We're fighting hard enough against the real physics simulation,

207
00:19:22,354 --> 00:19:26,980
but this is another aspect of the physics that needs to be taken care of.

208
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,083
And then you want to consider solutions that work into infinity.

209
00:19:32,582 --> 00:19:35,483
Which means you can't predict when a gameplay will end.

210
00:19:35,683 --> 00:19:37,984
You may want, like the player may continue forever.

211
00:19:38,064 --> 00:19:42,966
So in VR specifically, you might have to end up with other solutions.

212
00:19:43,006 --> 00:19:44,407
And we'll talk about it a little more later.

213
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:48,668
Let's see an example from Rick and Morty Virtual Reality

214
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,990
in the microverse where you're charging a battery.

215
00:20:43,781 --> 00:20:50,389
So I see this as a wonderful example for the viability of the product depending

216
00:20:50,509 --> 00:20:55,255
specifically on sound design and in this case ramping up the the speed of it

217
00:20:55,315 --> 00:20:56,957
depends on musicality as well.

218
00:20:58,418 --> 00:21:13,503
The first thing that ended up happening when we were prototyping this, if you look at kind of the size of this board, when we started prototyping and we tested that specific interaction,

219
00:21:14,164 --> 00:21:20,887
The player had to continuously scan the board left and right to find out where the player needs their attention.

220
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:29,671
This game was literally unplayable until sounds that came out specifically from the light bulbs helped.

221
00:21:30,011 --> 00:21:33,692
And again, we're listening to everything from mono, so I don't know if you can hear.

222
00:21:35,013 --> 00:21:36,154
But the concept is clear.

223
00:21:36,914 --> 00:21:39,976
The player knew exactly where to look at right

224
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:41,837
after I added the spatialization.

225
00:21:42,318 --> 00:21:45,159
But even better than that, even without,

226
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:48,041
if your sense of direction is not that great,

227
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:49,302
which can happen with people,

228
00:21:50,803 --> 00:21:53,104
the additional help was the pitch.

229
00:21:53,304 --> 00:21:56,126
So when the player looks to the left of the machine,

230
00:21:58,407 --> 00:22:00,508
they know, or when the player hear a lower note,

231
00:22:00,548 --> 00:22:02,510
they know they need to look at the left side of the machine.

232
00:22:02,913 --> 00:22:05,934
And when they hear a higher note, they know they need to look at the right side.

233
00:22:05,974 --> 00:22:12,996
And it intuitively becomes kind of a habit relatively quickly if you do that interaction a few times.

234
00:22:14,316 --> 00:22:17,317
Similarly, this device had two modules.

235
00:22:17,397 --> 00:22:26,860
So there was the clever solution that I've had with five modules and then three was using the minor pentatonic scale here.

236
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,125
Which, no matter how you randomize the notes, usually it sounds like a nice melody.

237
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:34,727
So that's kind of nice for that side.

238
00:22:34,747 --> 00:22:40,373
And then, without those modules, it just becomes the first three notes of a major scale.

239
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:45,017
Which also made it very easy to listen to all the time.

240
00:22:47,371 --> 00:22:52,374
This is another example of again turning an object into a musical instrument.

241
00:22:54,315 --> 00:22:57,477
And this is the avatar customizer in Vacation Simulator.

242
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:04,361
I'm specifically starting in this example from the elevator so that we can hear kind of how the environment also responds.

243
00:23:04,401 --> 00:23:07,943
The music changes from room to room in a very subtle transition.

244
00:23:08,523 --> 00:23:16,248
That doesn't sound like off-putting or doesn't sound real, like it does, it sounds very realistic and natural.

245
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:21,552
And also how you can still hear the elevator from behind you after you walk out of the elevator.

246
00:23:21,612 --> 00:23:22,252
Let's listen to this.

247
00:23:22,272 --> 00:23:28,656
Let's listen to this.

248
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,502
And also the music is diegetic here.

249
00:23:39,542 --> 00:23:40,723
It's coming from those speakers.

250
00:24:09,004 --> 00:24:13,307
What's the next phrase?

251
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:42,078
So I really love this example because it really shows like how you can get a menu to become a real musical instrument.

252
00:24:42,098 --> 00:24:44,139
You can improvise on it as you as you saw.

253
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:51,943
So an outlet to the player and how it adds to the emotion of the room and the environment.

254
00:24:53,443 --> 00:24:57,626
This is the bathroom where you customize your avatar and it feels very.

255
00:24:58,586 --> 00:25:05,471
Calm, relaxing, soft, and in this specific case, I wrote the music specifically for, like, to work with this

256
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:13,156
new instrument, so there are no wrong notes at any point. You can, no matter what note you play, it will sound good with the music.

257
00:25:14,277 --> 00:25:15,177
So that's definitely

258
00:25:16,258 --> 00:25:19,420
worth checking out. Now, this is an example of an infinite interaction.

259
00:25:21,222 --> 00:25:26,425
Just so you can see, I sped it up in the middle of the way so you can get a little more sense of it.

260
00:25:52,337 --> 00:25:54,939
So basically this will go on forever.

261
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:57,862
The player can keep playing it as long as they don't fail,

262
00:25:57,922 --> 00:26:00,104
they'll continue to hear it rise.

263
00:26:00,824 --> 00:26:04,107
And we all know that that's impossible to make happen.

264
00:26:04,808 --> 00:26:07,070
So this requires a specific trick

265
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,673
that you can utilize, it's the shepherd's tone.

266
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:15,158
The shepherd's tone is usually used for a single long pad,

267
00:26:15,218 --> 00:26:16,599
an infinite pad that rises.

268
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,321
But in this case I used it for mallet sounds.

269
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:32,444
What you see here are basically the four volume automation of four different channels that run at the same time.

270
00:26:34,105 --> 00:26:37,126
Obviously this is all baked. What we're looking at is the recording application.

271
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:46,652
Where and in the lowest note the notes are barely audible and it ramps up as you get to the meat

272
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,895
area and then on the high notes the

273
00:26:50,435 --> 00:26:51,596
or high octaves the

274
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,939
the notes gradually disappear and

275
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,581
about here is where

276
00:26:58,602 --> 00:27:03,385
this track jumps from the highest note to the lowest note and so

277
00:27:04,726 --> 00:27:06,908
it basically creates an illusion of where

278
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:16,394
The sounds infinitely rises while in fact the higher harmonics slowly disappear, the lower harmonics gradually comes in.

279
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:26,441
That's like a great effect that can and should be used for those kind of experiences to keep it musical and again a musical music scale.

280
00:27:27,182 --> 00:27:31,485
Let's talk a little bit about designing musical instruments in VR.

281
00:27:31,945 --> 00:27:35,188
So, first thing, things to consider.

282
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:43,234
Our perception, our hands for example, are very, very delicate and perceptive.

283
00:27:43,714 --> 00:27:47,517
We've got pressure in each corner of our finger.

284
00:27:48,442 --> 00:27:51,664
And when we're playing a guitar, for example,

285
00:27:51,724 --> 00:27:54,865
we have the ability to vibrate the guitar,

286
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,787
the strings in very subtle ways

287
00:27:57,847 --> 00:28:00,368
to make them sound natural and nice

288
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:02,609
in the way we like to hear the music.

289
00:28:03,269 --> 00:28:07,411
This is simply not possible in VR in its current stage.

290
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,293
Not even when the hand is being tracked

291
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:12,334
with all four fingers,

292
00:28:12,394 --> 00:28:14,675
because it's not as precise and as delicate

293
00:28:15,435 --> 00:28:15,916
as the...

294
00:28:16,936 --> 00:28:20,619
As the real world simulation, because we all know we live in a simulation,

295
00:28:21,861 --> 00:28:27,586
so as the real world simulation is able to respond to our fingers and our hands,

296
00:28:27,726 --> 00:28:36,534
one day we might be able to get there. The other thing is because we're in the real world,

297
00:28:36,574 --> 00:28:43,020
we're bound to the physics system. If we think about the trumpet, for example, it has the three

298
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:51,546
The three valves at the top here, the buttons that you click on, and it's kind of not sequentially to rise up.

299
00:28:51,566 --> 00:28:57,771
You actually need to create different combinations to get the notes to rise up in a scale.

300
00:28:59,292 --> 00:29:01,954
We don't have to. We are not bound to physics.

301
00:29:02,755 --> 00:29:09,040
We are not bound to the length of those tubes, meaning that we can make instruments that are more intuitive.

302
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:12,803
So it lends to limitations, but it also lends to.

303
00:29:13,654 --> 00:29:14,935
like creating cool things.

304
00:29:17,457 --> 00:29:22,221
The last thing is, well, I'll take a shaker and, or a.

305
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:31,422
Well, a shaker, for example, which is an instrument that sounds like it's easy to imitate

306
00:29:32,843 --> 00:29:37,506
in the virtual world, while in fact it is very, very complicated to get it right.

307
00:29:37,546 --> 00:29:43,510
And I'll talk a little bit about it later, but the granular versus global approach,

308
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:48,754
because we have a lot of grains inside that shaker that if we want to emulate right,

309
00:29:48,814 --> 00:29:52,416
we have to really, really think about how we want to.

310
00:29:53,517 --> 00:29:55,759
Create that emulation simulation

311
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,965
so let's talk about guitar a little bit or an ukulele in the case of

312
00:30:01,886 --> 00:30:06,811
Vacation simulator there are a few things that we want to consider for this medium first thing

313
00:30:07,652 --> 00:30:09,494
How do you measure a strum and in this case?

314
00:30:10,655 --> 00:30:14,078
We went with a single strum for all strings. You cannot do

315
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:15,960
each single string

316
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:21,707
How do you represent the instrument's response?

317
00:30:21,747 --> 00:30:24,290
Because everything needs to be visually responsive.

318
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:27,194
You don't have to rely 100% on audio.

319
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:31,939
And you can see here how we made it kind of like a graphical toy approach.

320
00:30:31,979 --> 00:30:34,703
And the strings only come out from here to here.

321
00:30:37,025 --> 00:30:38,826
Will it respond with one hand?

322
00:30:39,026 --> 00:30:44,769
And Alchemy specifically does a lot of work to try to make the games accessible to everyone.

323
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:54,494
And in this case, we sacrificed the second hand choosing harmony or changing the notes with basically a toy approach.

324
00:30:54,554 --> 00:30:55,995
If you see the lights right here.

325
00:30:56,936 --> 00:30:59,597
It kind of chooses the harmony or the chords for you.

326
00:30:59,637 --> 00:31:01,597
Again, we're working with a lot of limitations,

327
00:31:02,118 --> 00:31:03,418
and we're trying to make the best,

328
00:31:03,518 --> 00:31:05,379
best possible experience for our players.

329
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,741
And then how precise is your interaction?

330
00:31:09,841 --> 00:31:11,401
Well, do you want...

331
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:17,061
We wanted the plane here to be huge or small.

332
00:31:18,161 --> 00:31:22,202
And again, because we have a lot of precision situation here,

333
00:31:24,443 --> 00:31:27,844
the hands doesn't actually need to touch the strings to play them in our case.

334
00:31:27,904 --> 00:31:31,606
Because we found out that a lot of players will just find it so frustrating

335
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:35,367
that the design is too precise for them.

336
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:38,628
So again, accessibility is in our mind.

337
00:31:39,428 --> 00:31:41,509
Here's a small video I wanted to show.

338
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,780
That'll look nice in your garden.

339
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:09,265
Okay, so well in this case, I just wanted to show that

340
00:32:09,645 --> 00:32:14,186
in our game you can shrubify a ukulele.

341
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:18,152
and then use a shrub to shrink it.

342
00:32:18,192 --> 00:32:20,574
And when you shrink it, the harmony actually changes pitch

343
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:21,575
according to the size.

344
00:32:22,515 --> 00:32:26,078
Like, we went as far as to make sure that the world responds

345
00:32:26,158 --> 00:32:29,100
to the instruments in the way that, well,

346
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:33,424
the player can't expect to shrub a ukulele or shrink it,

347
00:32:33,544 --> 00:32:35,325
but if they can do that,

348
00:32:35,405 --> 00:32:36,946
then the world should respond accordingly.

349
00:32:36,966 --> 00:32:37,647
And that's something that...

350
00:32:39,428 --> 00:32:45,473
One of the reasons why it's worth adding in the prototypes, because then you can respond to it properly in your experience.

351
00:32:47,955 --> 00:32:54,461
Harmonica is an interesting problem because it's a breath instrument.

352
00:32:54,481 --> 00:32:57,844
You have to put breath to be able to interact with the harmonica.

353
00:32:58,785 --> 00:33:09,562
While a microphone does exist in most of our headsets, blowing on a microphone is not a reliable way to get any data.

354
00:33:09,783 --> 00:33:11,425
It's kind of...

355
00:33:13,997 --> 00:33:16,539
It's a random noise generator, basically.

356
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,062
You're not going to get data that you can drive music out of.

357
00:33:20,162 --> 00:33:22,224
And so you've got to think of other ways to do that.

358
00:33:22,885 --> 00:33:25,147
In this case, yes, there are interaction areas.

359
00:33:25,187 --> 00:33:30,691
And then things that you want to consider is how big, how far you'd want to put the harmonica in front of you.

360
00:33:31,452 --> 00:33:43,496
And in our case, we chose it to be far enough so that the player can see a highlight on whatever area that they're interacting with, so the player can actually make a choice.

361
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:50,358
The other thing is about the player's mouth distance from the headset, because again, we don't have that information.

362
00:33:52,258 --> 00:33:53,559
And we want to be inclusive.

363
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:54,219
There are people with...

364
00:33:55,181 --> 00:33:58,323
Long heads and short heads and we want to address all of them

365
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:06,088
So we kind of got to pick a size that works for everybody and then how many interactions area become confusing and that also lends

366
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:11,292
To how we feel the instruments because when we're using a harmonica in the real world

367
00:34:11,932 --> 00:34:14,674
The fingers can feel the screws that are in the harmonica

368
00:34:14,694 --> 00:34:21,099
You'll really know where you're you're holding the harmonica and you utilize your lips and your tongue to really feel

369
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,160
On which hole you're about to blow

370
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:30,966
So that you don't have to look to be able to play Harmonica properly, which just will never work in VR.

371
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:37,611
The last thing again, the shaker, the maracas, which, why is it so complicated?

372
00:34:37,711 --> 00:34:42,375
Well, first thing, even if you choose the approach of a single

373
00:34:44,736 --> 00:34:52,098
impact point and not full grains inside the shaker how much gravity will you put

374
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:57,580
on the on that thing really depends because it can be different from

375
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,601
reality and and bounce

376
00:35:01,582 --> 00:35:10,226
The very interesting effect that you can get from the shaker is the rain effect if you just rotate it or if you turn it in a circular motion.

377
00:35:10,806 --> 00:35:16,128
Because those two are different sounds by themselves of rain that you can generate from it.

378
00:35:16,969 --> 00:35:22,132
These have to be custom implementations of recognizing those type of gestures.

379
00:35:23,633 --> 00:35:30,077
And then, obviously, the physics aspect of it, of what velocity will equal what volume.

380
00:35:31,117 --> 00:35:36,361
So, to sum it all up, music gives you the ability to embellish

381
00:35:36,521 --> 00:35:39,222
interactions and intensify emotions in your game.

382
00:35:40,003 --> 00:35:47,089
Consider music accents in your experience early because again this can change your final product.

383
00:35:47,629 --> 00:35:52,613
And prototype to find the best solutions for your experience. Make sure to support the audio team

384
00:35:52,673 --> 00:35:58,158
with the systems and implementation solutions that will allow you to perform all the necessary tasks

385
00:35:58,618 --> 00:36:08,186
because it does require more programming power to be able to to solve. And with that the final thing.

386
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:24,037
Yes, so thank you very much.

387
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,582
We do have some time for questions.

388
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,485
I just had more of a comment than a question,

389
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:39,166
which was when I was at Magic Leap,

390
00:36:39,706 --> 00:36:40,806
one of the first things we,

391
00:36:41,046 --> 00:36:43,907
it's the difference between VR music and AR music.

392
00:36:44,647 --> 00:36:49,148
One thing we discovered quite early was that if you

393
00:36:49,188 --> 00:36:55,189
have non-diegetic music too loud in your AR experience,

394
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:59,050
it immediately masks everything else that becomes VR immediately.

395
00:36:59,711 --> 00:37:03,831
Music in AR, if you want to mix with the real world,

396
00:37:04,392 --> 00:37:08,334
has to be kind of way in the background and very soft and not very attention-getting

397
00:37:08,634 --> 00:37:15,737
because if it's a regular game music, it'll just mask everything in the room and you won't be able

398
00:37:15,757 --> 00:37:20,400
to talk to anybody, you'll see their mouths moving. So it's a different kind of experience

399
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:25,382
between AR and VR. Absolutely, and I was only talking about the music today, not the sound

400
00:37:25,402 --> 00:37:30,185
design, but if we talk about sound design in VR, there's a lot of details that you want to...

401
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:35,304
Make sure you're not obscured by the music either because then you're detracting from the experience as well.

402
00:37:36,628 --> 00:37:37,209
Yeah, thank you.

403
00:37:39,677 --> 00:37:40,678
Hi, really great talk.

404
00:37:40,738 --> 00:37:42,418
Nicole Lazaro from Xeo Design.

405
00:37:42,438 --> 00:37:44,679
This is fun to talk on the headphones.

406
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:45,759
This is great.

407
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,740
I had a question about, well, great presentation.

408
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,921
I have a question about three-dimensional sounds,

409
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:53,861
like getting a little bit more depth.

410
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:58,162
We just did the Bose AR game jam a couple months ago.

411
00:37:58,963 --> 00:38:00,643
And we created a choose your own adventure,

412
00:38:00,663 --> 00:38:03,104
where we actually did audio escapes.

413
00:38:03,164 --> 00:38:03,884
And you interact.

414
00:38:03,904 --> 00:38:07,205
You're using audio to determine, make your choices.

415
00:38:07,225 --> 00:38:08,485
You don't have to even look at your phone.

416
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,968
I was curious in terms of design, are we going to get there?

417
00:38:12,988 --> 00:38:15,870
It's sort of like, Stereo seems to me like Flatland,

418
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:17,711
where it's just between two points.

419
00:38:17,831 --> 00:38:18,112
Right.

420
00:38:18,552 --> 00:38:22,255
But we have your chicken fairy godmother at two o'clock high,

421
00:38:22,335 --> 00:38:24,436
and then the frog she's talking to down low.

422
00:38:24,456 --> 00:38:27,738
It just creates a much more interesting volume,

423
00:38:27,778 --> 00:38:30,080
not just a, kind of a 360.

424
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,182
How do you talk about it being 3D, but not,

425
00:38:33,683 --> 00:38:34,963
I mean, but being additionally 3D,

426
00:38:34,983 --> 00:38:37,625
where you can actually walk through a space?

427
00:38:37,825 --> 00:38:41,787
So first thing, this is what I was talking about when I meant spatialization.

428
00:38:42,547 --> 00:38:46,848
And the main function is HRTF, head related transfer function.

429
00:38:46,888 --> 00:38:51,950
This is the official term and there are like quite a lot,

430
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:54,951
like I think four or five big,

431
00:38:55,131 --> 00:38:59,293
like bigger companies that already make really great spatialization tools.

432
00:38:59,313 --> 00:39:03,414
Yeah. We use the resonance plug in. Resonance is lovely. Yeah.

433
00:39:05,015 --> 00:39:10,160
And Resonance, by the way, have their activity built into it already, which is also kind of nice.

434
00:39:11,761 --> 00:39:18,107
So there's a lot of solutions, they have many things, but yeah, like it's ready for everybody to use. I'm not sure what else.

435
00:39:20,249 --> 00:39:21,330
Like in terms of...

436
00:39:23,472 --> 00:39:28,417
Like I see it as a mandatory tool to create... Are you asking if I think...

437
00:39:29,498 --> 00:39:33,140
Like this is enough to create an experience, just the spatialization.

438
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,402
Well that's definitely true, I think it already is.

439
00:39:35,562 --> 00:39:41,986
I tried a lot of the Bose experiences, I feel like they have been missing out a little bit

440
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:46,209
because I have heard better spatialization in VR.

441
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:50,913
It's probably because they have to have a lot of compromises in terms of processing.

442
00:39:51,914 --> 00:39:53,675
because like the Bose headset...

443
00:39:54,396 --> 00:39:55,217
It's on a mobile phone.

444
00:39:55,357 --> 00:39:57,499
It does, it does it on the mobile. Actually, you're right.

445
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:00,022
So I'm not sure why it didn't...

446
00:40:00,603 --> 00:40:05,027
I couldn't pinpoint to the exact area like I do in VR.

447
00:40:05,108 --> 00:40:09,012
I can close my eyes in VR and point where the sound is coming from

448
00:40:09,052 --> 00:40:10,353
and I would mainly be right.

449
00:40:10,393 --> 00:40:13,396
After I open my eyes, I look at it, this is where it's coming from.

450
00:40:14,197 --> 00:40:17,379
In Bose, I didn't feel like I was able to do that when I was looking around.

451
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:20,441
You should try your experience, but if there's a, there's sort of like a 2D,

452
00:40:20,861 --> 00:40:23,603
in terms of art, because it's helpful to have language around this.

453
00:40:23,884 --> 00:40:27,406
So in my mind, and I could be completely off base, but you know, it's 2D.

454
00:40:27,786 --> 00:40:31,369
You then have 3D, so almost 3D kind of audio, and then you have 6D.

455
00:40:33,208 --> 00:40:34,708
Yes, of course.

456
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:35,948
Where you can actually move through it.

457
00:40:36,008 --> 00:40:36,969
Right.

458
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:43,370
The difference between what ambisonics, for example, can perform to what the 3D spatialization

459
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:43,990
can perform.

460
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:49,431
Like you have a single location area and a sphere around you, or you pick where you

461
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:50,492
put it in the 3D space.

462
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,992
I mean, I think it has a lot of potential and a lot of future for sure.

463
00:40:53,012 --> 00:40:56,873
Yeah, you can just walk through like a marketplace and all the sounds pass you as you walk.

464
00:40:56,893 --> 00:40:57,393
That kind of thing.

465
00:40:57,933 --> 00:40:58,113
Thank you.

466
00:40:58,133 --> 00:40:58,313
Yes.

467
00:40:58,533 --> 00:40:58,953
Yeah, thank you.

468
00:41:00,818 --> 00:41:03,541
I'll be really quick. Thank you. That was awesome.

469
00:41:04,481 --> 00:41:12,309
Quick question. What's your favourite process or planning tool that you use to communicate with your production team?

470
00:41:14,643 --> 00:41:26,270
Well, first thing, at Alchemy I'm also a programmer, so I do a lot of the prototypes that I want to do, and we have a very interesting language inside the company.

471
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:32,233
It's kind of funny because at Alchemy they're like, Daniel, make the sounds.

472
00:41:33,934 --> 00:41:37,035
They bring me in early enough that I can ask enough questions

473
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:40,436
and that we can iterate and go back and forth

474
00:41:41,556 --> 00:41:43,436
just like any other prototype.

475
00:41:43,656 --> 00:41:44,977
And I think that's the main thing.

476
00:41:45,017 --> 00:41:47,357
It allows me to improve over time,

477
00:41:47,477 --> 00:41:50,298
understand the vision of the specific experience,

478
00:41:50,558 --> 00:41:53,639
and well, the unfortunate consequences is that, you know,

479
00:41:53,959 --> 00:41:55,099
just like any prototypes,

480
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:59,180
let's say anywhere between 30 and 70% of it will go to the trash.

481
00:42:02,044 --> 00:42:04,085
And what if you were working with a remote team?

482
00:42:04,425 --> 00:42:05,246
How would you manage that?

483
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:09,329
We do have some programmers on remote capacity.

484
00:42:09,409 --> 00:42:14,653
And it's a lot of video conversations, just the ability

485
00:42:14,693 --> 00:42:19,417
to see and sense what's happening, and constant

486
00:42:19,477 --> 00:42:20,017
iterations.

487
00:42:20,397 --> 00:42:22,179
That's all I can say about that, really.

488
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:22,839
Thank you.

489
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:23,340
Thank you.

490
00:42:27,994 --> 00:42:36,484
Hi, in working a lot with VR, people still get motion sickness because primarily because

491
00:42:36,504 --> 00:42:39,268
they're moving their heads too fast.

492
00:42:39,288 --> 00:42:43,152
And when I'm standing over them, I can go, hey, pretend it's a video camera.

493
00:42:43,213 --> 00:42:44,354
Quit jerking around.

494
00:42:45,115 --> 00:43:00,348
Have you considered or tried any kind of auditory feedback that's the equivalent of slow your head movement down in order to avoid that thing, which is still huge in the industry?

495
00:43:00,368 --> 00:43:06,693
Yeah, I haven't found a solution audio related to that.

496
00:43:07,874 --> 00:43:09,515
At Alchemy, we see that as a...

497
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:13,053
Yes, it is a problem with the speed of the head.

498
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:17,737
Of course, the faster you'd move, the less the frames would be able to respond properly.

499
00:43:18,238 --> 00:43:25,425
But that's why on PC experiences we have such a strict hard limit to make the performance

500
00:43:25,465 --> 00:43:27,067
of our games work at 90 frames.

501
00:43:29,289 --> 00:43:38,191
The higher the frame rates of the game are, you can improve the feeling of that sensation of motion significantly.

502
00:43:38,871 --> 00:43:44,172
The frame drops are what really causes the problem, as far as I can perceive it.

503
00:43:46,393 --> 00:43:50,554
So it's more about solving that, really, the performance.

504
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,495
You can't get the user to hyper down?

505
00:43:55,909 --> 00:44:02,253
Well, I wish, but it also kind of defeats the purpose of the freedom that we want to give the players.

506
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:09,418
If we can solve it, then on our end, without restricting the player

507
00:44:10,479 --> 00:44:15,402
in the way they interact with the world, we will work really really hard to solve it, and it's worth it.

508
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:17,463
Thank you.

509
00:44:18,624 --> 00:44:19,605
Okay, thank you very much.
