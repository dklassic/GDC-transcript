1
00:00:03,345 --> 00:00:03,765
All right.

2
00:00:04,526 --> 00:00:05,746
Looks like it's go time here.

3
00:00:05,766 --> 00:00:06,846
You guys all ready?

4
00:00:09,187 --> 00:00:09,667
All right.

5
00:00:11,468 --> 00:00:14,328
So I just want to say thanks to GDC for inviting me out here.

6
00:00:14,368 --> 00:00:16,629
It's a real honor to be up here on stage in front of you all.

7
00:00:16,909 --> 00:00:18,870
And I really hope you enjoy what you're about to see.

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,011
My name is Rick Lico, animation director at the new VR game

9
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:23,851
studio PolyArch.

10
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:25,951
I've been animating in the gaming industry

11
00:00:26,031 --> 00:00:28,412
professionally now for about 18 years,

12
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:30,853
primarily focused on the gameplay animation role.

13
00:00:32,316 --> 00:00:34,357
You may recognize my work with Quill here,

14
00:00:34,777 --> 00:00:37,658
or from many other games, series such as Destiny, Halo,

15
00:00:37,798 --> 00:00:40,219
Condemned, many, many more I've had the sincere pleasure

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,880
of being a part of.

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,141
Today, I'm here to talk about animating Quill,

18
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:46,442
the protagonist of our first game, Moss.

19
00:00:49,764 --> 00:00:50,884
But for those who may not know yet,

20
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,245
who is Quill and what is Moss?

21
00:00:58,067 --> 00:01:00,948
Your time has come at last, dear reader.

22
00:01:03,093 --> 00:01:05,314
But this story is not yours alone.

23
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:06,155
No.

24
00:01:07,035 --> 00:01:08,556
It is tied to another.

25
00:01:34,424 --> 00:01:47,113
When all the paths are overgrown And evening falls with crimson glow

26
00:01:47,393 --> 00:01:57,000
Into the forest I will flow And in its shadow fall

27
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:24,466
Your bond with Quill grows strong.

28
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:27,188
And the journey you take together

29
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:30,429
could change the fate of both our worlds.

30
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:33,891
Shall we begin?

31
00:02:43,217 --> 00:02:45,378
All right, the world of Moss, it's vast.

32
00:02:49,648 --> 00:02:50,869
And it includes many stories.

33
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,651
But we decided to start with Quill and the adventure she

34
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:55,592
takes with you, the reader.

35
00:02:56,272 --> 00:02:57,753
Luckily, people seem to like the idea of

36
00:02:57,793 --> 00:02:58,493
adventuring with her.

37
00:02:58,873 --> 00:03:01,394
In fact, I've never seen people have such a stark

38
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,295
emotional reaction to a character I've

39
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:03,956
worked on before.

40
00:03:04,556 --> 00:03:06,877
And much of this reaction happened prior to the release

41
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:07,578
of the game itself.

42
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,821
People often talk to her like she's listening.

43
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,641
They'll feel protective of her.

44
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:16,142
They'll rely on her for help and want to help her in return.

45
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:19,663
People seem to feel a genuine emotional bond

46
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:21,003
with this little virtual mouse.

47
00:03:22,404 --> 00:03:25,024
But what is it about Quill that creates

48
00:03:25,044 --> 00:03:26,365
this emotional response?

49
00:03:26,945 --> 00:03:28,525
Now, this is the question driving

50
00:03:28,605 --> 00:03:29,685
the purpose of this talk.

51
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:31,386
So over the next 45 minutes or so,

52
00:03:31,906 --> 00:03:33,326
I'm going to try and answer this question

53
00:03:33,386 --> 00:03:34,827
from the animator's perspective.

54
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:38,327
So online, and even here at GDC, you're

55
00:03:38,347 --> 00:03:40,768
going to be exposed to an incredible amount of information

56
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:42,588
about the latest tools and technologies.

57
00:03:43,309 --> 00:03:46,430
But it's really quite difficult to find information and steps

58
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,071
you can take to draw emotion from players.

59
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:51,312
This is inherently a subjective topic,

60
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:53,813
but I'm going to try my best to make it less subjective

61
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:56,153
by describing the constraints we have faced

62
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:57,874
and the steps we have taken.

63
00:03:58,574 --> 00:04:00,455
My hopes are that by hearing our story,

64
00:04:00,955 --> 00:04:02,916
you'll be able to take home some ideas you

65
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:04,296
can use for your own characters.

66
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,943
So to help frame our constraints, I need to give you a little information about PolyArch

67
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:10,483
the studio.

68
00:04:10,503 --> 00:04:13,545
Now, PolyArch consists of 15 full-time employees.

69
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:18,988
We're a handful of industry vets from the AAA space, and we're taking a risk making

70
00:04:19,048 --> 00:04:20,549
our first game as an indie startup.

71
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:24,912
And we're learning a lot about what it takes to make it on our own.

72
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:30,796
We've learned just how expensive it is to run our own studio, that people are the largest

73
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:34,938
cost of business operation, so it's essential to keep the team as slim as possible.

74
00:04:36,147 --> 00:04:40,394
that getting the attention of gamers and creating an experience that stands out is super challenging

75
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,597
and that despite our situation,

76
00:04:43,178 --> 00:04:46,243
Moss will be judged in comparison to game staff by much larger

77
00:04:46,864 --> 00:04:48,346
and more substantial budgets.

78
00:04:51,469 --> 00:04:52,930
So to help overcome these constraints,

79
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,471
we focused our animation efforts towards these three

80
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:56,651
main principles you see here.

81
00:04:57,472 --> 00:04:59,713
Building a character from honest life experiences,

82
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:01,853
creating compelling characters in VR,

83
00:05:02,694 --> 00:05:04,715
and creating a realistic workflow that enables

84
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:05,955
us to accomplish our goals.

85
00:05:06,475 --> 00:05:08,916
Now, let's begin by illustrating why

86
00:05:08,956 --> 00:05:10,537
we've chosen to go the VR route.

87
00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:14,857
If you look at the history of our industry, the competitive

88
00:05:14,877 --> 00:05:17,519
playing field is often reset when new technologies and

89
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:19,501
markets become viable in the retail space.

90
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:21,682
And a good example of this is mobile

91
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:22,703
gaming from 10 years ago.

92
00:05:23,764 --> 00:05:26,246
In these marketplaces, the competitive field is much

93
00:05:26,346 --> 00:05:29,689
smaller, with the expectations relatively undefined.

94
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:33,031
We knew it would be incredibly difficult to go toe to toe

95
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,913
with well-established and well-funded console and PC

96
00:05:35,953 --> 00:05:38,155
developers as an indie startup.

97
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,041
And also, the technology is really interesting to us.

98
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:45,102
It's super exciting to be working in VR

99
00:05:45,202 --> 00:05:46,762
because it's unexplored terrain.

100
00:05:48,263 --> 00:05:49,783
There's so much undiscovered potential,

101
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:51,944
so we decided to take advantage of what we

102
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:53,704
saw as the next industry reset.

103
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:57,966
But VR introduces some unique challenges we've never really

104
00:05:58,006 --> 00:05:58,746
encountered before.

105
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:02,007
Everyone's first VR experience is usually fairly shocking.

106
00:06:02,207 --> 00:06:03,867
And it creates a sense of realism

107
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:04,968
and a feeling of immersion.

108
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:08,271
Yet many of the early VR character performances

109
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:11,333
found in most games were anything but immersive.

110
00:06:12,054 --> 00:06:13,795
They often relied on the tried and true methods

111
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:16,438
of the past, where characters are simple avatars who

112
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,701
respond to basic gameplay inputs and basic AI routines.

113
00:06:23,103 --> 00:06:25,205
Two years ago, when we started our journey,

114
00:06:25,746 --> 00:06:28,268
we made a demo for Moss where Quill was just that.

115
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:30,189
She was a simple gameplay avatar.

116
00:06:31,138 --> 00:06:35,582
You can see here some of the early footage of the world of Moss and Quill herself,

117
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:37,323
and she doesn't feel alive yet.

118
00:06:38,284 --> 00:06:41,527
If we would have stuck with this approach and simply polished what's here,

119
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,110
she would have been maybe proficient, but not memorable.

120
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:48,653
It's because she's merely a gameplay abstraction here.

121
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:55,579
Now decades of gaming have trained us to accept certain abstract concepts.

122
00:06:56,361 --> 00:06:57,822
We press buttons on an input device,

123
00:06:57,882 --> 00:06:59,303
and a character on screen in front of us

124
00:06:59,763 --> 00:07:01,224
performs an action as a result.

125
00:07:01,864 --> 00:07:03,945
This is completely normal to us gamers now.

126
00:07:04,325 --> 00:07:07,227
But if you were to show somebody this from 300 years ago,

127
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:10,789
what a traditional game was, they wouldn't understand it.

128
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,671
The interface and the resulting actions,

129
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:16,552
they're really a learned experience.

130
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:20,034
And this learned acceptance of the abstract.

131
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:25,216
makes us more forgiving when we see our game characters merely react to controller inputs

132
00:07:25,336 --> 00:07:28,099
instead of acting like living, breathing people and creatures.

133
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:32,162
We've gotten used to seeing things like popping between animation samples,

134
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:35,124
playing a limited, repetitive set of animation clips,

135
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:37,386
or defying physics with reckless abandon.

136
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:40,849
These are all standard issues we see every day as gamers,

137
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,270
and we've grown numb to them.

138
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,012
But VR, it relies on immersion to be most effective.

139
00:07:47,312 --> 00:07:50,234
And characters who pop and play repetitive animations

140
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:52,115
and defy physics even slightly,

141
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:54,336
it really removes you from the experience.

142
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:56,297
But more importantly,

143
00:07:56,578 --> 00:07:58,899
characters who pander to gameplay systems,

144
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:02,041
acting as simple avatars devoid of personality,

145
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:05,443
have a substantially negative impact on VR's immersion.

146
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:07,724
You're inside a world that feels real,

147
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:10,926
but you're joined by creatures who cater to you

148
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:11,486
as the player.

149
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:14,873
it reminds us that we're just playing a game.

150
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:18,816
Now I'm not saying player avatars no longer have a place.

151
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:20,757
In Moss, you play the role as the reader

152
00:08:21,198 --> 00:08:23,760
who intentionally has no predefined personality,

153
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,341
so you can define it with your own.

154
00:08:25,681 --> 00:08:27,502
The reader is our avatar character.

155
00:08:28,403 --> 00:08:29,924
I'm referring to characters you interact with

156
00:08:29,964 --> 00:08:31,305
inside of VR, such as Quill here.

157
00:08:31,926 --> 00:08:34,668
In the world of Moss, you and Quill exist simultaneously.

158
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:36,729
You, as the character in the game,

159
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:38,570
can reach into the world and interact with it

160
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:39,371
in natural ways.

161
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,352
while the movement stick and the face buttons of your controller,

162
00:08:42,372 --> 00:08:46,113
they guide Quill much like a standard third-person action adventure game

163
00:08:46,133 --> 00:08:48,714
where X is jump, square is attack, both of them are dodge.

164
00:08:50,795 --> 00:08:54,976
So to help Quill be more than just a standard third-person action avatar,

165
00:08:55,516 --> 00:08:58,817
we need her to be able to interact with the player in more natural ways,

166
00:08:58,957 --> 00:09:00,317
more meaningful ways.

167
00:09:01,538 --> 00:09:04,759
When you're in VR, you're not just witnessing the character's adventure,

168
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:05,819
you're part of it.

169
00:09:06,973 --> 00:09:10,015
So we can and should break the fourth wall in VR.

170
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:12,156
But how do we do that?

171
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:15,718
Well, the most obvious way to do this

172
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:18,260
is to simply have Quill make eye contact with you.

173
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:22,202
Looking people in the eye is a powerful way to connect

174
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:23,402
and is no different here.

175
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,744
The frequency of this and the times when she chooses to do it

176
00:09:27,245 --> 00:09:28,525
will tell you what she's thinking.

177
00:09:31,462 --> 00:09:33,444
Now, if you saw your friend from across the room

178
00:09:33,484 --> 00:09:36,386
and wanted to get their attention, what would you do?

179
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:38,688
You wouldn't look at him and press the X button.

180
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:41,150
It's just not how people work.

181
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,812
Instead, you'd wave at them, right?

182
00:09:44,473 --> 00:09:46,114
This is one of the advantages of VR.

183
00:09:46,895 --> 00:09:49,137
Waving is natural, and having a character

184
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:51,279
that responds to what feels natural,

185
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:54,041
it really begins to make them feel alive.

186
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:56,303
So, remember that fictional gamer

187
00:09:56,323 --> 00:09:57,584
I mentioned from 300 years ago?

188
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:00,466
They'd instantly get this.

189
00:10:00,997 --> 00:10:02,638
Look at that. I am so glad I'm not the one sliding.

190
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:03,958
She's jumping on the lever.

191
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:07,000
Good job, Quill. Good job, Quill. Do not jump.

192
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,721
Oh, she went back!

193
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:09,001
Hi!

194
00:10:10,162 --> 00:10:10,362
So,

195
00:10:12,743 --> 00:10:14,705
Quill will tell you when she's had enough waving, too.

196
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:16,506
Yeah.

197
00:10:19,107 --> 00:10:19,948
By having her do this,

198
00:10:20,408 --> 00:10:23,089
we're establishing personal boundaries like real friends have.

199
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,890
From the player's perspective,

200
00:10:25,211 --> 00:10:27,672
she's not just a representation of a gameplay system.

201
00:10:28,312 --> 00:10:29,973
She's asserting her own personality here.

202
00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:34,450
Now being able to pet Quill and have her react to it

203
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,071
is another way to make her more than just an avatar.

204
00:10:38,752 --> 00:10:39,993
Every time we add something like this

205
00:10:40,033 --> 00:10:42,714
into the gameplay space, we help tell her story

206
00:10:42,874 --> 00:10:45,295
outside of cinematics and the traditional narrative.

207
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:49,117
Oh, and she will get sick of being pet too much.

208
00:10:51,058 --> 00:10:51,919
Smack that hand away.

209
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:53,800
Setting those personal boundaries

210
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,160
are really important in a friendship, right?

211
00:10:56,985 --> 00:10:59,467
So a lot of people who played our E3 demo

212
00:10:59,787 --> 00:11:02,349
really wanted to high five Quill after beating some enemies

213
00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:03,330
or solving a puzzle.

214
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,412
But they didn't really expect her to high five them,

215
00:11:06,452 --> 00:11:06,732
did they?

216
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:09,834
I mean, that's not what a character does in a game.

217
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:19,342
They do now.

218
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:21,783
And if you let her wait too long,

219
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:24,886
she'll high five herself.

220
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,240
You know, she doesn't need you.

221
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:31,043
She's a confident and secure, self-reliant mouse

222
00:11:31,403 --> 00:11:32,944
who doesn't need your approval to party.

223
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:34,645
You missed out.

224
00:11:36,107 --> 00:11:38,488
So many games often use a hint system

225
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:41,551
to help players stuck on puzzles or lost in an environment.

226
00:11:42,512 --> 00:11:44,393
And this is often done inside the game's UI.

227
00:11:45,234 --> 00:11:46,755
But we couldn't do this in VR.

228
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:47,596
There's no UI.

229
00:11:48,676 --> 00:11:49,997
We had to find a way to communicate

230
00:11:50,037 --> 00:11:52,379
the same information, but in a way that fit

231
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,921
the platform in the game's design.

232
00:11:55,402 --> 00:11:55,862
Yes, you.

233
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:57,919
OK.

234
00:11:57,939 --> 00:11:59,620
Oh, you're going to go around that way.

235
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:00,840
Pick him up.

236
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,700
OK, come back.

237
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:03,421
All right, cool.

238
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:04,341
I think I know what you mean.

239
00:12:05,562 --> 00:12:08,583
So by helping you solve puzzles, Quill becomes your partner.

240
00:12:09,003 --> 00:12:11,104
It implies that she's capable of complex thought,

241
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:12,804
not just sitting in an idle animation

242
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:14,025
awaiting your next input.

243
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:16,686
This helps to build a bond with the player.

244
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:21,628
Speaking of the player, having an elephant charge at you in VR

245
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:25,429
is absolutely terrifying, unless you're not looking at it.

246
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,168
In VR, the player's head is the camera,

247
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:31,469
so they may choose to look anywhere.

248
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:33,811
Traditional games have been struggling with this as well.

249
00:12:34,451 --> 00:12:36,012
How do you make sure the player sees

250
00:12:36,112 --> 00:12:37,193
what you want them to see?

251
00:12:37,213 --> 00:12:40,275
In VR, this becomes even more challenging

252
00:12:40,315 --> 00:12:43,337
since looking around in 360 is part of the experience.

253
00:12:44,978 --> 00:12:46,959
So, forcing the player to look where you want them to,

254
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,121
maybe that's really the wrong perspective

255
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:51,062
to have of the problem.

256
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:54,304
For thousands of years, people have been entertaining others

257
00:12:54,604 --> 00:12:55,905
who can choose to look away.

258
00:12:56,665 --> 00:12:58,366
So instead of approaching this problem

259
00:12:58,386 --> 00:13:00,586
like we would a traditional game or even a film,

260
00:13:01,607 --> 00:13:03,807
why not think about this as a stage show?

261
00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:06,448
In the image above, events of interest

262
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:08,769
will be happening on that stage, while the rest

263
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,870
of the environment is really just there to support it.

264
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,451
By thinking about our characters like they're

265
00:13:13,471 --> 00:13:15,811
performers on a stage, it provides us

266
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:17,672
with a more relevant perspective.

267
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,500
But even with the most interesting things happening

268
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,702
where we'd like you to focus, we can't guarantee the player

269
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:26,022
will choose to watch.

270
00:13:26,423 --> 00:13:27,503
So what do we do?

271
00:13:28,184 --> 00:13:30,225
Well, there's the obvious things,

272
00:13:30,265 --> 00:13:32,566
like using sound cues, lighting, and motion

273
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:33,826
to help draw the player's attention.

274
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:37,488
We do certainly utilize these tricks, and they do help some.

275
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:41,610
We can also choose to accept it and simply provide players

276
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,052
with enough opportunities to understand the game

277
00:13:44,092 --> 00:13:45,232
without seeing everything.

278
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,394
Hopefully, players might even want to go back and see

279
00:13:48,414 --> 00:13:48,954
what they missed.

280
00:13:51,072 --> 00:13:55,660
But the most effective way we've discovered is to use interactivity as a form of camera

281
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,020
control.

282
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:00,929
You're not just controlling Quill, you're partnering with her on her adventure, which

283
00:14:00,989 --> 00:14:02,692
means you're inside the world with her.

284
00:14:03,798 --> 00:14:07,360
There may be a door too large for a mouse to open, but certainly not too big for a human.

285
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:12,422
By giving you a role in the world, we know where you'll be likely looking, and we can

286
00:14:12,482 --> 00:14:15,543
target Quill's performances around these interactive moments.

287
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:21,085
We can even give her multiple performances based on her position relative to the interactive

288
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:23,686
object, since we know you'll see it.

289
00:14:26,468 --> 00:14:29,529
So to sum up the first section, VR certainly adds new

290
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:32,551
opportunities for character exploration beyond traditional

291
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:34,572
gaming due to its more natural forms of

292
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:35,552
interaction and immersion.

293
00:14:36,673 --> 00:14:41,075
We're really just scratching the surface, but maybe, maybe

294
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:42,955
if we do this right, we can make a name for ourselves.

295
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:46,637
But VR is not enough to make Quill stand out.

296
00:14:47,738 --> 00:14:49,619
There have been tons of amazing, memorable characters

297
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:50,860
who define gaming.

298
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,742
So I've heard somewhere that Mario's more recognizable

299
00:14:54,762 --> 00:14:57,023
than Mickey Mouse these days, which blows my mind.

300
00:14:58,124 --> 00:15:00,646
The competition is absolutely intimidating.

301
00:15:01,126 --> 00:15:03,728
So how can we possibly make Quill stand out,

302
00:15:04,088 --> 00:15:06,489
make her a character that people will remember?

303
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,251
Again, I'll illustrate our constraints

304
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,492
to frame how we've chosen to answer this question.

305
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:15,154
Now, among our staff, the average number

306
00:15:15,175 --> 00:15:16,415
of years in the industry is 11 or so.

307
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:22,502
And most of us came from Bungie, a studio with an intense laser focus on gameplay feel.

308
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:27,005
So we as a team, we've got a lot of experience making solid gameplay.

309
00:15:27,685 --> 00:15:30,127
But now we're faced with the challenge of creating Quill,

310
00:15:30,687 --> 00:15:32,769
a partner character which you directly control,

311
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:35,571
who has the emotional depth of a friend.

312
00:15:36,511 --> 00:15:38,172
And this is uncharted territory for us.

313
00:15:38,673 --> 00:15:41,495
So we started by defining what we didn't want to do.

314
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:47,034
So to make Quill stand out, we knew we wanted to avoid common gameplay tropes.

315
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:49,174
So what are common gameplay tropes, you may ask?

316
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:53,716
They're the things that almost all game characters do out of necessity or even tradition.

317
00:15:54,616 --> 00:15:59,398
They're so well-known that they transcend the character using it and become iconic in

318
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:00,018
their own right.

319
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:02,699
Examples such as the ground pound here.

320
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,219
How many games have a ground pound in it?

321
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:04,840
It's insane.

322
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,540
Destiny has, what, three of them, right?

323
00:16:07,922 --> 00:16:12,123
The fist clench, I'm going to get you evil guy, you know, like it's so common.

324
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:18,646
Giving Quill iconic actions such as these would be the best way to remove her personality.

325
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:22,868
Another example is the over idle loop used to keep characters looking alive while they

326
00:16:22,908 --> 00:16:23,428
stand still.

327
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:29,831
It was certainly a necessity of the past, but I don't think it applies anymore to modern

328
00:16:29,851 --> 00:16:30,351
game design.

329
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:33,172
And no cheese.

330
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,412
Like, we, honestly, it's such a trope. Like, we

331
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:40,233
really just wanted to focus on honest actions taken

332
00:16:40,293 --> 00:16:42,614
from real life, not, not cheese.

333
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,837
OK. So, if we can't rely on tropes, what

334
00:16:47,977 --> 00:16:51,518
can we do? Well, we can observe people. We

335
00:16:51,558 --> 00:16:53,779
can observe the world around us. We could be

336
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:57,341
students of the human condition, become amateur psychologists.

337
00:16:58,942 --> 00:16:59,502
Should be looping.

338
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:02,996
Ask ourselves, who was Quill at her core, and how

339
00:17:03,016 --> 00:17:05,337
would she genuinely respond to her world and her

340
00:17:05,377 --> 00:17:05,877
context?

341
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:08,758
When confronted with a floating player head, how would

342
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:09,419
she react?

343
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:12,820
Our goal wasn't just to write a narrative describing

344
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,461
the events that took place in her adventure.

345
00:17:15,241 --> 00:17:16,402
It was to create a world that you could

346
00:17:16,422 --> 00:17:19,183
inhabit and build a relationship with a mouse in.

347
00:17:20,964 --> 00:17:21,904
Now let me ask this question.

348
00:17:21,984 --> 00:17:23,825
What's the job of an animator?

349
00:17:24,705 --> 00:17:27,707
Now, unfortunately, I've met too many non-animators

350
00:17:27,727 --> 00:17:30,529
that would respond with, well, animators create movement.

351
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,952
But as I'm sure you all know, the job of an animator

352
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:35,453
is actually to bring a character to life.

353
00:17:36,894 --> 00:17:38,856
To do this, you need to do a hell of a lot more

354
00:17:38,896 --> 00:17:39,836
than make a character move.

355
00:17:41,137 --> 00:17:42,599
It's an animator's job to help create

356
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:45,941
a history for their characters, to give them a perspective,

357
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:50,285
to communicate complex emotion merely by seeing them think.

358
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:54,725
to further the narrative by showing how it affects your character's belief system and

359
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:55,186
actions.

360
00:17:56,967 --> 00:18:02,009
And who Quill is emotionally at the start of Moss is quite different from who she becomes

361
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,730
at the end.

362
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,752
During your adventure with her, we hope you'll see her think.

363
00:18:06,572 --> 00:18:10,854
We hope you'll feel her emotions, and we hope you'll believe that she and the world of Moss

364
00:18:10,894 --> 00:18:11,495
have a history.

365
00:18:12,495 --> 00:18:13,376
So how are we doing this?

366
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:17,787
By giving Quill the ability to speak in sign language,

367
00:18:18,288 --> 00:18:21,610
we're implying that at some point, she learned this language.

368
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:24,531
This creates a history and a demonstration

369
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:25,512
of her intelligence level.

370
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:28,474
But it's also very honest and based in reality.

371
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:31,415
Sign language exists to help overcome a disability.

372
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:33,997
Even though Quill can hear just fine,

373
00:18:34,217 --> 00:18:36,498
she's incapable of communicating verbally with you.

374
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:40,421
We've chosen to keep our use of signing fairly basic

375
00:18:40,461 --> 00:18:42,382
so not to alienate anyone who may not know it.

376
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:47,057
Within the proper context, even people who don't speak sign,

377
00:18:47,217 --> 00:18:50,218
like myself, will likely still understand the message

378
00:18:50,278 --> 00:18:51,318
she's trying to convey.

379
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,179
But honest performances, they don't end with sign language.

380
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:59,040
In this video, we expect most players

381
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,700
to be excited to dig into Quill's world,

382
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,020
so Quill invites you in.

383
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:05,501
This is one of the 40 or so response animations

384
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:08,222
Quill will use to express her opinions and react to you.

385
00:19:08,902 --> 00:19:09,482
By doing this,

386
00:19:11,675 --> 00:19:17,403
Her actions helped define her and reinforce the feelings we want you, the player, to be experiencing.

387
00:19:18,265 --> 00:19:24,193
Quill was designed to amplify your experience, to be a mirror for your own emotional arc.

388
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:28,459
Her response animations were created with that reflection in mind.

389
00:19:30,255 --> 00:19:34,638
So there may be the occasional moment where you're pressing a direction on the analog stick

390
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:36,279
and she's just not reacting.

391
00:19:36,499 --> 00:19:39,341
And honestly, isn't this like gameplay no-no 101, right?

392
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:40,882
Like, that's a bad thing, right?

393
00:19:41,482 --> 00:19:43,603
And sure, it's often frowned upon by players

394
00:19:44,044 --> 00:19:48,467
and certainly caused our design team to puff up like pufferfish when I first suggested it.

395
00:19:49,127 --> 00:19:49,267
But...

396
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:55,680
It's a calculated tradeoff to provide Quill with perceived autonomy.

397
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:01,542
To help minimize any potential frustration, we limit when and where we choose to allow

398
00:20:01,622 --> 00:20:02,582
Quill this autonomy.

399
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:07,204
Occasionally, we'll allow it after a player input, such as climbing a ledge or pulling

400
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:11,525
a lever, actions that require a button press to activate, so it doesn't feel too out of

401
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:11,785
place.

402
00:20:12,585 --> 00:20:16,726
Otherwise, we relegate it to non-combat situations while Quill's standing still already.

403
00:20:17,747 --> 00:20:23,253
Active players who often keep Quill on the move may miss out on a lot of her personality

404
00:20:23,293 --> 00:20:26,836
moments so we're actually still trying to figure out the proper cadence for this.

405
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:32,522
So I love Uncharted, The Last Guardian, Tomb Raider, the Assassin's Creed games.

406
00:20:34,284 --> 00:20:39,469
They in my opinion represent some of the finest examples of characters who transcend the common

407
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:40,330
game avatar.

408
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,140
and become real people and creatures.

409
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,181
Beyond cinematic performances, much of this

410
00:20:46,241 --> 00:20:48,762
is due to how well the personality of these characters

411
00:20:48,802 --> 00:20:50,762
are represented during gameplay.

412
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,523
They don't simply perform gameplay actions.

413
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:54,723
They show emotions.

414
00:20:55,064 --> 00:20:55,544
They think.

415
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:57,224
And they react to their world.

416
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:00,665
And much like those games.

417
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:04,200
We focused on Quill's identity during gameplay.

418
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,780
By maintaining the uniqueness of her personality

419
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,241
throughout her gameplay actions,

420
00:21:08,481 --> 00:21:10,141
we're supporting all the work we've done

421
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,882
with her autonomous reactions and personality moments.

422
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:16,222
Our goal is to represent who she is at all times,

423
00:21:16,682 --> 00:21:18,423
not just give her a bucket of animation.

424
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:20,883
But gameplay feel is paramount.

425
00:21:21,304 --> 00:21:23,344
Remember when I mentioned how pops, repetition,

426
00:21:23,404 --> 00:21:25,945
and wonky physics can ruin a VR character?

427
00:21:26,658 --> 00:21:30,140
Well, by alleviating as many of those issues as we could, and

428
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,762
there's still a lot of work to do, we helped craft a more

429
00:21:33,802 --> 00:21:35,423
believable performance that we honestly

430
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:36,503
hope feels good to play.

431
00:21:39,143 --> 00:21:41,964
And Quill also needs to feel fluid moving around her environment.

432
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,484
She should obey the laws of physics whenever possible.

433
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:49,786
She should be instantly responsive, respecting player intent 100% of the time.

434
00:21:50,546 --> 00:21:54,507
She should have a robust set of animations describing her actions in unique and varied

435
00:21:54,547 --> 00:21:54,828
ways.

436
00:21:55,548 --> 00:22:00,849
And she should do all of this without betraying her character or giving into common gameplay

437
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:01,270
tropes.

438
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,390
And she is quite the risk taker.

439
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:09,126
Thank God there's no fall damage, right?

440
00:22:11,467 --> 00:22:13,647
So just because we're a VR game, it

441
00:22:13,687 --> 00:22:15,948
doesn't mean we get a pass when it comes to the feel of combat

442
00:22:15,988 --> 00:22:16,188
either.

443
00:22:16,909 --> 00:22:19,009
Combat needs to be instantly responsive,

444
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:19,970
matching player intent.

445
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,711
It needs proper interrupt frames and a good flow

446
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:23,451
to the sword swings.

447
00:22:23,971 --> 00:22:25,412
Player will need to be able to evade

448
00:22:25,452 --> 00:22:28,013
with short invincibility windows like in a Street Fighter game.

449
00:22:28,995 --> 00:22:32,961
So how do we do this without making Quill feel like a gameplay avatar?

450
00:22:33,702 --> 00:22:35,585
Well, we animate her actions with honesty.

451
00:22:35,986 --> 00:22:39,752
How would such a small, youthful mouse affect her world?

452
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:42,056
Well, she'd be doing it by giving 110%

453
00:22:43,997 --> 00:22:46,418
by wearing her emotional conviction on her sleeve.

454
00:22:46,858 --> 00:22:48,699
Like any teenager, she'd approach her world

455
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:50,040
assuming she'll never die.

456
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,881
So she'll act out of reckless abandon.

457
00:22:53,702 --> 00:22:54,842
She doesn't just swing her sword,

458
00:22:54,902 --> 00:22:56,823
she swings her entire body

459
00:22:57,163 --> 00:22:58,504
and throws herself at the effort

460
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,485
without a thought to her own safety.

461
00:23:01,365 --> 00:23:02,946
We make sure she carries her personality

462
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,847
across every action she takes.

463
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,263
And of course, we also have a traditional narrative

464
00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:09,704
to tell about Quill's adventure.

465
00:23:10,384 --> 00:23:12,345
And due to our limited budget and team size,

466
00:23:12,765 --> 00:23:16,127
we actually choose to forego the traditional cinematic approach

467
00:23:16,147 --> 00:23:18,748
and instead tell our story inside of a book format.

468
00:23:19,528 --> 00:23:21,149
Now, all of the honest performance decisions

469
00:23:21,189 --> 00:23:24,050
we make for Quill in gameplay we echo

470
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,651
in a handful of animated pages.

471
00:23:26,511 --> 00:23:29,773
And just because Quill is animating on a page

472
00:23:29,853 --> 00:23:31,313
doesn't mean you can't still interact with her.

473
00:23:33,772 --> 00:23:35,832
We've made it possible for Quill to peer out of the book

474
00:23:36,132 --> 00:23:37,273
and track your location.

475
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:40,054
This interactivity helps to further the bond

476
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:41,615
between Quill and the player.

477
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:43,996
And we're just scratching the surface with this idea.

478
00:23:44,016 --> 00:23:46,576
And we barely make use of this in Moss.

479
00:23:46,596 --> 00:23:48,757
This is actually the only time that we've got this working,

480
00:23:48,977 --> 00:23:50,698
because it was actually a real pain in the butt to set up.

481
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:55,060
But we honestly hope to take this prototype much further

482
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,420
in future projects.

483
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:02,333
So acting autonomously, creating honest, personality-driven

484
00:24:02,373 --> 00:24:04,815
performances, focusing on gameplay

485
00:24:05,256 --> 00:24:06,637
while keeping her actions unique.

486
00:24:08,338 --> 00:24:10,660
We believe these are the important factors

487
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,762
in defining Quill as a character and giving her

488
00:24:12,802 --> 00:24:14,103
a fighting chance at standing out

489
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:15,445
amongst an industry of titans.

490
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,768
But without enough quality animation content

491
00:24:18,948 --> 00:24:22,351
to support these performances, it actually just all falls apart.

492
00:24:23,522 --> 00:24:25,504
And this final section details our process

493
00:24:25,984 --> 00:24:29,026
for creating enough animation to fill the world of Moss

494
00:24:29,567 --> 00:24:32,029
at a quality bar essential to his success.

495
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:35,632
Now, a basic understanding of animation terminology

496
00:24:35,692 --> 00:24:37,333
is going to be assumed beyond this point.

497
00:24:39,154 --> 00:24:40,495
So let me just frame this for you.

498
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:43,818
Imagine you're leaving your secure job

499
00:24:43,878 --> 00:24:45,919
as lead animator at Bungie, so you may join your friends

500
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,542
at their startup studio, making Moss

501
00:24:48,622 --> 00:24:50,163
as the only animator in Rigor.

502
00:24:52,418 --> 00:24:54,318
You've got enough animation experience,

503
00:24:54,878 --> 00:24:56,919
but you've never worked as a professional rigger before.

504
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:00,199
Yet, you must make the animation pipeline from scratch.

505
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,400
Your wife and three kids come first,

506
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,300
and you cannot sacrifice them to the game god,

507
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:09,741
so a crushing crunch schedule, it can't happen.

508
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:13,281
And every dollar you put towards animation for Moss

509
00:25:13,502 --> 00:25:15,862
will shorten the time you have to make the game itself.

510
00:25:16,742 --> 00:25:18,742
So you can't afford to hire or outsource

511
00:25:19,403 --> 00:25:20,283
indie startup and all, right?

512
00:25:21,673 --> 00:25:24,194
One last thing, if the game fails because of animation,

513
00:25:25,314 --> 00:25:26,855
you've let your friend's lifelong dream

514
00:25:26,875 --> 00:25:27,575
die a horrible death.

515
00:25:29,116 --> 00:25:29,816
No pressure, right?

516
00:25:31,276 --> 00:25:32,377
So what do you do?

517
00:25:33,177 --> 00:25:36,438
Well, looking holistically at the animation pipelines of my

518
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:40,059
past, what does the animation team spend most

519
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:40,800
of their time doing?

520
00:25:42,815 --> 00:25:45,856
Well, number one, supporting a monolithic character pipeline.

521
00:25:46,536 --> 00:25:48,636
Now, I certainly need a character pipeline in place.

522
00:25:49,117 --> 00:25:52,037
But if I'm not careful, this can take a tremendous amount

523
00:25:52,077 --> 00:25:52,878
of time to create.

524
00:25:53,838 --> 00:25:57,759
Now, how can I make a powerful and robust pipeline super

525
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:57,979
cheap?

526
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,561
So number two, creating a system that makes iteration

527
00:26:03,601 --> 00:26:04,681
difficult or costly.

528
00:26:05,341 --> 00:26:07,322
Making a game is all about chasing

529
00:26:07,342 --> 00:26:09,422
that elusive notion of fun.

530
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:10,523
What does fun mean?

531
00:26:11,183 --> 00:26:11,943
So to do this.

532
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,042
There's obviously going to be a tremendous amount

533
00:26:16,082 --> 00:26:17,082
of iteration needed.

534
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:19,504
And it's traditionally a huge time sync,

535
00:26:19,524 --> 00:26:21,425
one of the biggest time syncs in game development.

536
00:26:22,185 --> 00:26:24,607
Honestly, who nails fluid gameplay on the first try?

537
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:27,488
Even the 10th try, like, it's crazy.

538
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:28,329
It's so much work.

539
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:31,451
So I need to make sure we can iterate quickly,

540
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:34,773
so animation was really never a limiting factor

541
00:26:34,813 --> 00:26:35,874
for design or engineering.

542
00:26:37,414 --> 00:26:40,736
And the last thing, biggest time sync for animators is you.

543
00:26:41,745 --> 00:26:42,806
Yep, you quill.

544
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:46,468
Animating to a high quality bar can be a huge time sink.

545
00:26:46,508 --> 00:26:48,229
How can I streamline this process

546
00:26:48,849 --> 00:26:50,290
without sacrificing quality?

547
00:26:51,631 --> 00:26:53,052
Now that we've defined the constraints

548
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:56,494
and understand the importance and the needs of the project,

549
00:26:57,154 --> 00:26:59,355
we can focus on coming up with creative solutions.

550
00:27:00,936 --> 00:27:02,537
So I just need to define one term

551
00:27:02,757 --> 00:27:03,918
before going into all of this.

552
00:27:05,877 --> 00:27:09,439
When I talk about the rig, what I'm referring to is the animation control rig.

553
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:15,764
At PolyArc, we have the character setup, which includes the mesh, the skeleton, the sockets,

554
00:27:15,824 --> 00:27:16,384
the point weights.

555
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:22,208
Due to the constraints of working in a game engine, it's easiest if we don't alter any

556
00:27:22,248 --> 00:27:23,329
part of this character setup.

557
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:27,792
Other than adding the occasional leaf node for attachments, the bone hierarchy, it will

558
00:27:27,832 --> 00:27:29,513
not change once the character is finalized.

559
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,898
Now, our animation control rig, or rig for short,

560
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:37,340
are the handles we interact with when animating inside of Maya.

561
00:27:38,321 --> 00:27:40,262
When our rig is applied, it lives outside

562
00:27:40,282 --> 00:27:42,003
of the character setup and drives

563
00:27:42,023 --> 00:27:43,144
the bones using constraints.

564
00:27:43,964 --> 00:27:46,006
The rig is not exported into Unreal

565
00:27:46,406 --> 00:27:48,488
and operates inside of Maya exclusively.

566
00:27:49,128 --> 00:27:51,770
This allows us to alter our rig however we choose

567
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,771
without altering the character setup.

568
00:27:55,612 --> 00:27:55,712
So.

569
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,524
The best way to solve a problem is to make sure you fully

570
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:03,448
understand the question and by not assuming that the optimal

571
00:28:03,508 --> 00:28:05,169
answers have already been discovered.

572
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:10,153
So I questioned the need for Maya files and storing rigs in

573
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:10,954
reference scenes.

574
00:28:11,634 --> 00:28:14,537
Now, we can save one source Maya file per character so we

575
00:28:14,557 --> 00:28:17,079
can preserve our materials, our display layers, and file

576
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:21,002
settings, but beyond that, is there really a reason to save

577
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:22,603
Maya animation files?

578
00:28:24,592 --> 00:28:28,134
But what's the problem with saving Maya animation files?

579
00:28:28,954 --> 00:28:31,275
Well, referencing prevents hierarchy changes

580
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:34,356
to the rig, which is a workflow limiter.

581
00:28:35,637 --> 00:28:37,257
And if we don't reference and choose

582
00:28:37,277 --> 00:28:39,278
to save Maya files with local rigs inside them,

583
00:28:39,878 --> 00:28:41,999
we'd need a batching process to distribute updates.

584
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,261
But more importantly, we use Unreal,

585
00:28:46,181 --> 00:28:48,502
which utilizes the FBX format as its source.

586
00:28:49,422 --> 00:28:52,103
When we create new animations or make changes to animations

587
00:28:52,484 --> 00:28:53,304
inside of Unreal.

588
00:28:54,383 --> 00:28:55,783
it outputs to an FBX format.

589
00:28:56,563 --> 00:29:00,184
If we save Maya files and Unreal saves FBX files,

590
00:29:00,744 --> 00:29:02,424
won't this desync our data?

591
00:29:04,265 --> 00:29:06,905
So my animation files come with a cost.

592
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:10,226
But aren't my animation files really a standard workflow

593
00:29:10,246 --> 00:29:10,606
practice?

594
00:29:11,866 --> 00:29:13,526
Yeah, but each studio is different,

595
00:29:13,867 --> 00:29:15,807
and we need to forge our own path

596
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:18,047
while being mindful of the reasons driving

597
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:19,128
other studios' decisions.

598
00:29:20,468 --> 00:29:23,588
So we decided to make Maya files optional for animation.

599
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:28,461
We can save them, but we no longer need to save them.

600
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,621
Any Maya file will be considered ancillary,

601
00:29:32,201 --> 00:29:33,482
not the archival format.

602
00:29:34,602 --> 00:29:36,322
Unreal and all major animation packages,

603
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:39,183
they use FBX, and so will we.

604
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:42,564
Future animators can work in whatever animation package

605
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:45,524
they want, such as Max, MotionBuilder, Maya,

606
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:46,605
they all use FBX.

607
00:29:47,505 --> 00:29:49,905
Any updates that Unreal does to the FBX file

608
00:29:50,626 --> 00:29:51,466
is now accounted for.

609
00:29:52,186 --> 00:29:54,367
Nothing's ever out of date, and we never need to batch.

610
00:29:55,754 --> 00:29:57,455
But what about our animation rigs?

611
00:29:58,035 --> 00:29:58,956
Where do our rigs live?

612
00:30:00,997 --> 00:30:03,679
Well, we can store our rigs inside of a script.

613
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:07,221
We can start an animation by opening the source Maya file

614
00:30:07,301 --> 00:30:08,482
for the character we're working on,

615
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:12,744
import any existing animation if needed from an FBX,

616
00:30:13,424 --> 00:30:15,366
and apply the rig over the animation data.

617
00:30:16,046 --> 00:30:17,827
The trick here is making sure the rig doesn't

618
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:21,089
cause any degradation of animation when applying.

619
00:30:22,223 --> 00:30:23,624
But the benefits of working this way

620
00:30:23,684 --> 00:30:25,645
are simplicity and flexibility.

621
00:30:26,786 --> 00:30:28,186
If I make a change to the rig itself,

622
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:29,927
I simply update the script.

623
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:33,409
And the next time I apply the rig, I'm applying the latest.

624
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:37,771
And I can alter the rig as I please while animating.

625
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:41,172
And if the rig breaks, I simply bake it down,

626
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:43,253
I burn the rig with fire, and I start over again.

627
00:30:45,654 --> 00:30:48,255
But what about all the data traditionally

628
00:30:48,295 --> 00:30:49,456
saved inside of Maya files?

629
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:50,676
Are we really?

630
00:30:51,465 --> 00:30:53,246
OK with not archiving that data anymore.

631
00:30:54,306 --> 00:30:55,187
Well, fuck yeah.

632
00:30:55,227 --> 00:30:55,967
Like, really.

633
00:30:56,007 --> 00:30:58,789
Like, aren't those benefits the same constraints

634
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:02,831
complicating iteration and requiring a huge suite of tools

635
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:03,431
to support?

636
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,453
Like, tools that I don't have the time to create.

637
00:31:08,354 --> 00:31:11,556
And we can still use animation layers and motion paths

638
00:31:11,596 --> 00:31:13,016
and the time editor and all these cool things

639
00:31:13,036 --> 00:31:13,917
that Maya has to offer.

640
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:17,119
And we can even save those Maya scenes if we choose.

641
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,340
We just need to be mindful that those scenes are temporary.

642
00:31:22,174 --> 00:31:24,918
So as animators gain experience, they also

643
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:26,019
gain workflow knowledge.

644
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,642
Yet in some circumstances, you may

645
00:31:28,702 --> 00:31:31,826
find brilliant scripting experts making workflow decisions

646
00:31:31,986 --> 00:31:32,807
for the animators.

647
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:35,611
Now, this usually happens because the person

648
00:31:35,671 --> 00:31:39,275
writing the tool or rig can be seen as the decision maker.

649
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:44,569
But the problem here is the workflow experts

650
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:47,431
aren't the ones designing the workflow in that situation.

651
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:50,932
And when there's a lack of collaboration between the two,

652
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:53,674
the tools can become inefficient or even a barrier

653
00:31:53,714 --> 00:31:54,675
to the creative process.

654
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:58,737
You may have a well-written tool,

655
00:31:59,757 --> 00:32:01,358
but it may not enable the animator.

656
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:04,420
So knowledge-based decision making

657
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,301
is needed to empower the content creators.

658
00:32:08,577 --> 00:32:11,059
Now, in our situation, we have the opposite problem.

659
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:15,341
I know animation workflow well, but I don't know Python.

660
00:32:15,681 --> 00:32:17,302
And I need to make rigs that bake over bones

661
00:32:17,342 --> 00:32:19,183
without any loss or alteration of the motion.

662
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:21,084
Now, I'm sure I could learn Python,

663
00:32:21,644 --> 00:32:24,286
but that would take time away from the more important task,

664
00:32:24,306 --> 00:32:25,346
which is making the game.

665
00:32:26,607 --> 00:32:28,428
And I could potentially outsource our rigs,

666
00:32:28,548 --> 00:32:30,289
but if they break, I'd be in the dark

667
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:31,749
about fixing the problem myself.

668
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:32,730
And that costs money, too.

669
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,292
I'm also too much of a control freak for any risk like that.

670
00:32:37,532 --> 00:32:37,633
So.

671
00:32:38,705 --> 00:32:43,327
I know the output window in Maya will echo every action I perform as a MEL command.

672
00:32:45,168 --> 00:32:49,430
And thanks to my experience as an animator, I can do all the operations to manually build

673
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,151
a rig over existing animation without any data loss.

674
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:53,311
That's actually the easy part.

675
00:32:54,212 --> 00:32:59,514
Therefore, I can use the output window's MEL to teach myself rigging by simply performing

676
00:32:59,554 --> 00:33:01,555
the steps and copying the output into a script.

677
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,716
Now, could a real rigger do better?

678
00:33:04,736 --> 00:33:05,776
Abso-fucking-lutely.

679
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:12,184
But I'm all Polyarch has, and this is what I'm capable of doing within a tight schedule

680
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:13,325
and on a tight budget.

681
00:33:14,286 --> 00:33:16,689
This is actually how all character rigs for Moss were made.

682
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:22,455
And for future projects, I sincerely hope to collaborate with a brilliant rigger who

683
00:33:22,495 --> 00:33:27,500
respects knowledge-based decision making, because I'm fully aware that I should not

684
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,921
be making or scripting decisions.

685
00:33:31,339 --> 00:33:36,244
So how do we make the animation process faster and more iterative while keeping a focus on

686
00:33:36,425 --> 00:33:36,945
quality?

687
00:33:37,526 --> 00:33:42,151
Well, we start by reducing the complexity commonly found in traditional animation rigs

688
00:33:42,191 --> 00:33:43,733
and focus more on flexibility.

689
00:33:44,514 --> 00:33:48,759
Also by finding ways to automate some of the more routine steps.

690
00:33:49,712 --> 00:33:51,293
Now, quick caveat.

691
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:52,614
I'm not gonna have time to explain

692
00:33:52,654 --> 00:33:55,456
how each and every trick I'm gonna show you here is made.

693
00:33:56,116 --> 00:33:57,797
That would be an entire talk into itself.

694
00:33:58,178 --> 00:34:00,579
But I want to highlight the high-level goals

695
00:34:00,879 --> 00:34:02,280
that make these workflows possible.

696
00:34:03,761 --> 00:34:06,983
So optimal rig settings for the many different situations

697
00:34:07,043 --> 00:34:10,065
an animator will encounter is nearly impossible

698
00:34:10,165 --> 00:34:11,266
for one rig to do well.

699
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:15,268
For example, so optimal settings between posing and tweening

700
00:34:15,468 --> 00:34:16,949
can often be quite different.

701
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,242
Let's say you set up your character, your rig, with an FK spine,

702
00:34:21,722 --> 00:34:25,064
because posing your character is actually quite easy to do that way.

703
00:34:25,705 --> 00:34:29,527
But tweeting with an FK spine, it requires a ton of counter-animating

704
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:31,308
to prevent the head from wobbling.

705
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:33,690
And you wouldn't animate a bouncing ball

706
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,531
by putting it at the end of a bone chain,

707
00:34:36,071 --> 00:34:37,933
rotating those bones to make the ball bounce, would you?

708
00:34:38,653 --> 00:34:39,754
Even though I did, because I'm insane.

709
00:34:42,855 --> 00:34:44,835
So why try and tween a spine this way?

710
00:34:44,855 --> 00:34:45,935
It just doesn't make sense to me.

711
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:50,156
Yet, setting up a rig for optimal tweening

712
00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:52,657
has a completely different set of trade-offs

713
00:34:52,677 --> 00:34:54,838
that would impact how easy it is to do posing

714
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:55,618
or some other steps.

715
00:34:57,018 --> 00:34:59,979
Now, I can go into details on all the different approaches

716
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:02,019
to rigging and the trade-offs they create,

717
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,940
but the problem I always seem to run into is the same.

718
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,881
I need to alter my rig in meaningful ways

719
00:35:09,261 --> 00:35:11,502
as I work to be most effective.

720
00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:15,151
Now this means being able to convert the animation data

721
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:19,415
of any object into any space or relative to any other object.

722
00:35:20,095 --> 00:35:23,018
It also means having the option to alter the hierarchy

723
00:35:23,058 --> 00:35:24,299
without any animation loss.

724
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,482
Essentially, opening the animation sandbox

725
00:35:27,522 --> 00:35:29,784
to as many options as we can, allowing

726
00:35:29,824 --> 00:35:32,646
for creative problem solving as we animate.

727
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:35,849
So how do we do this?

728
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:41,044
Most studios create rigs featuring numerous attributes

729
00:35:41,144 --> 00:35:43,325
used to drive everything from fingers to foot rolls.

730
00:35:43,805 --> 00:35:46,746
The idea behind this approach is to empower the animator,

731
00:35:47,726 --> 00:35:49,287
to give them a fine-tuned control

732
00:35:49,327 --> 00:35:50,407
over the animation process.

733
00:35:50,908 --> 00:35:54,089
But what it actually does is limit the animator's sandbox,

734
00:35:54,909 --> 00:35:57,270
forcing a manual animation process.

735
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,900
It prevents the animator from switching

736
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,361
the relative space of the control

737
00:36:01,921 --> 00:36:03,381
without altering the motion itself.

738
00:36:03,981 --> 00:36:06,922
Now this can lead to counter animating and editing curves

739
00:36:06,982 --> 00:36:09,323
that may not directly relate to the motion itself.

740
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:11,324
I'm sure many of you dealt with foot setups

741
00:36:11,344 --> 00:36:13,204
that have 20 million attributes on the foot

742
00:36:13,344 --> 00:36:15,225
and you're doing the foot lean, the foot roll,

743
00:36:15,265 --> 00:36:16,365
and then the balance and the bend,

744
00:36:16,405 --> 00:36:18,206
and then it's, what are these curves doing?

745
00:36:18,266 --> 00:36:19,126
I don't know anymore.

746
00:36:20,066 --> 00:36:21,267
It can get a little confusing.

747
00:36:22,807 --> 00:36:25,708
Just to be clear, I'm not saying that custom attributes

748
00:36:25,948 --> 00:36:26,988
are a bad way to animate.

749
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:31,109
What I'm saying is that for me personally, they slow me down.

750
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:35,990
So at PolyArch, we're only using custom attributes

751
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:37,971
for the facial rig controls only.

752
00:36:38,751 --> 00:36:41,392
The ability to switch the space of any rig component

753
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:44,693
is essential to our workflow, keeping all animation

754
00:36:44,713 --> 00:36:47,653
data in the form of translation, rotation, and scale.

755
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,441
maintains a simple and easy to understand interface,

756
00:36:51,961 --> 00:36:55,522
while also making a nearly unlimited sandbox.

757
00:36:56,362 --> 00:36:58,262
And this huge sandbox allows us to create

758
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:00,803
workflows which automate the animation

759
00:37:00,823 --> 00:37:03,223
process in many situations, rather than providing

760
00:37:03,283 --> 00:37:05,344
a ton of manual animation options,

761
00:37:05,564 --> 00:37:07,424
because manual animation options, they take time.

762
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:11,105
Any scripts I make are optional modules

763
00:37:11,625 --> 00:37:14,185
that can vary between broad and specific workflow

764
00:37:14,205 --> 00:37:14,906
optimizations.

765
00:37:14,926 --> 00:37:16,306
Here, I'm going to give you a few examples.

766
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,694
So this is how I work with Quill's spine.

767
00:37:22,797 --> 00:37:25,541
So I've got a motion loaded on there, and I've applied the

768
00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:28,706
rig, and the rig, when it first applies, is in FK,

769
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,069
meaning I rotate lower in the spine, and it

770
00:37:31,129 --> 00:37:31,990
translates upper.

771
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,861
rotate their heads translating.

772
00:37:35,742 --> 00:37:38,084
I do have everything set to world space rotations right now,

773
00:37:38,144 --> 00:37:40,466
so when I rotate lower, it doesn't rotate the children

774
00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:40,846
object.

775
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,608
I can switch between FK and IK.

776
00:37:43,668 --> 00:37:47,671
I tend to like doing FK posing, because when I make changes

777
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:48,512
to the spine, it moves it.

778
00:37:49,213 --> 00:37:51,454
And then I can switch the spine into an aim space setup,

779
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:53,776
where I'm just grabbing those controls and moving them

780
00:37:53,816 --> 00:37:54,157
around.

781
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:01,763
So I pose in FK, and I tween in aim space.

782
00:38:02,985 --> 00:38:06,506
And the animation data is unaltered when I switch between those spaces.

783
00:38:07,246 --> 00:38:11,228
Some of you may be asking yourself, well, how are you baking SplineIK into your character?

784
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:12,688
Well, I'm not.

785
00:38:13,228 --> 00:38:17,830
I'm using a hierarchy of embedded aim constraints for the up vector as a child of the existing

786
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,892
rotation of the individual bones to avoid any of the gimbal issues that you normally

787
00:38:21,912 --> 00:38:23,332
get with aim constraints.

788
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:27,986
And when I translate the rig components inside the hierarchy,

789
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:29,726
it alters the rotation of the bones

790
00:38:30,166 --> 00:38:32,587
as an offset from what they were previously doing,

791
00:38:32,947 --> 00:38:35,148
essentially acting as spline IK, but it works

792
00:38:35,168 --> 00:38:36,008
with your Easy Bake Oven.

793
00:38:37,669 --> 00:38:39,770
So the spine isn't the only place

794
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,190
where conversion makes animation much easier.

795
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:43,651
Here's another example.

796
00:38:43,711 --> 00:38:46,532
Have you ever tried to animate a tail swishing around

797
00:38:46,972 --> 00:38:48,813
and interact with the ground or a wall?

798
00:38:49,533 --> 00:38:52,254
It can really be time consuming to do this well.

799
00:38:54,347 --> 00:38:57,909
Well, here you can see that the tail's just flowing around in FK,

800
00:38:57,949 --> 00:38:59,790
and it's going through the wall, and it's going through the floor.

801
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:03,672
And here I'm proving that it's in FK, because apparently I didn't trust myself.

802
00:39:04,452 --> 00:39:07,834
And then I'm converting it into the aim space that I used for the spine.

803
00:39:08,254 --> 00:39:10,155
So now I can just grab those points, and I can translate them.

804
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:14,277
And the cool thing here is, I can take anything that's translating below the ground,

805
00:39:15,078 --> 00:39:17,059
grab those translation curves, and zero them out.

806
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,760
And now the tail slides along the ground.

807
00:39:20,864 --> 00:39:22,825
And let's say that I don't want it going through the wall.

808
00:39:23,225 --> 00:39:24,525
I find out the distance of the wall.

809
00:39:25,185 --> 00:39:27,546
I make sure that those translations never

810
00:39:27,566 --> 00:39:28,406
go past that wall.

811
00:39:29,227 --> 00:39:31,167
And now I've taken the FK rotations

812
00:39:31,907 --> 00:39:33,888
and turned it into interacting with the wall on the ground.

813
00:39:35,668 --> 00:39:37,169
And I can even offset it in time.

814
00:39:37,469 --> 00:39:39,149
And the cool thing about offsetting translations

815
00:39:39,189 --> 00:39:41,370
through space is when you offset rotation,

816
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:43,531
you can cause wobble at the end of your chain.

817
00:39:43,711 --> 00:39:45,531
But when you're offsetting translations in space

818
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:47,612
and it's updating your rotations for you,

819
00:39:47,672 --> 00:39:48,552
you never get that wobble.

820
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,265
So manually animating your overlap and your detail,

821
00:39:56,586 --> 00:39:58,447
it can be a lot of fun for an animator.

822
00:39:58,467 --> 00:40:00,049
That's one of the animator's favorite things to do.

823
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:01,750
But it also takes time.

824
00:40:03,051 --> 00:40:04,592
And depending on the skill of the animator,

825
00:40:04,952 --> 00:40:06,954
it may or may not look consistent.

826
00:40:07,474 --> 00:40:09,716
So leveraging physics to supplement this area

827
00:40:09,836 --> 00:40:11,237
is a huge time saver.

828
00:40:12,037 --> 00:40:15,080
And it allows for more realism, if done correctly, and maybe

829
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,481
even more consistency.

830
00:40:17,762 --> 00:40:20,243
So this is how I work with physics on Quill's spine.

831
00:40:22,218 --> 00:40:24,901
So you can see here, I started out with just a core posing of her waving.

832
00:40:25,621 --> 00:40:27,723
And I'm just going to send things to auto tangent real quick.

833
00:40:28,544 --> 00:40:32,527
And then I'm just going to clean up her up and down on her cog, just to give her some

834
00:40:32,607 --> 00:40:33,128
flow to it.

835
00:40:33,988 --> 00:40:35,369
And that's all I did to get to this point.

836
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,993
And now I'm going to convert her spine into that aim space.

837
00:40:40,714 --> 00:40:43,056
And then I'm just going to prove that it's an aim space.

838
00:40:44,477 --> 00:40:46,679
And then I'm just going to run physics on the different spine components.

839
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,429
And I can run different levels of physics,

840
00:40:50,509 --> 00:40:52,850
and I can run them multiple times to give me

841
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:53,991
the proper offsets that I want.

842
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:57,292
And now when I press Play, free overlap.

843
00:40:59,914 --> 00:41:01,174
I don't have to do this work anymore.

844
00:41:01,914 --> 00:41:02,715
It's done for me.

845
00:41:03,095 --> 00:41:05,916
And I can even offset the middle of the spine in time

846
00:41:06,477 --> 00:41:07,877
because I'm in this AIM space setup.

847
00:41:08,578 --> 00:41:10,058
And by offsetting it in time, I'm

848
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:11,939
not screwing up any of the other bones

849
00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:13,800
or any other bits of animation.

850
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,601
I'm just creating even more overlap.

851
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:18,502
And it's because I'm in this type of a setup right here.

852
00:41:21,388 --> 00:41:24,130
So finally, I've got one more cool trick to show you guys.

853
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:27,311
This is actually how I animate Quill's ears.

854
00:41:28,251 --> 00:41:32,393
So I start out with just basic core posing, where the ears

855
00:41:32,453 --> 00:41:33,554
just hit a few poses.

856
00:41:34,594 --> 00:41:36,095
And then I press the Animate This Shit button.

857
00:41:36,115 --> 00:41:40,617
OK, now they're animated.

858
00:41:44,538 --> 00:41:47,279
And that's just off of a few basic poses and what her head

859
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:48,000
was already doing.

860
00:41:50,153 --> 00:41:52,435
I could manually animate Quill's ears if I chose to.

861
00:41:52,835 --> 00:41:54,416
And there are certain high action clips

862
00:41:54,456 --> 00:41:57,258
that simply require an animator's hand to accomplish,

863
00:41:57,338 --> 00:41:58,859
like when she's rolling on the ground and stuff.

864
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,562
But the point here is, it's an optional tool, not

865
00:42:02,602 --> 00:42:03,242
my replacement.

866
00:42:03,703 --> 00:42:05,784
As an animator, I'm able to make plug and play

867
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:08,166
scripts for common animation needs myself.

868
00:42:09,046 --> 00:42:12,149
And this flexibility comes from a simple and open sandbox

869
00:42:12,169 --> 00:42:12,749
set of tools.

870
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:16,211
When we started Moss, I was actually animating

871
00:42:16,472 --> 00:42:17,873
all of this stuff by hand.

872
00:42:19,776 --> 00:42:23,479
And I was only able to produce maybe three or four seconds

873
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:25,281
of quality animation in a day.

874
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:29,124
But after I wrote all these little optional tools

875
00:42:29,204 --> 00:42:31,186
and little workflow tricks, I'm actually

876
00:42:31,206 --> 00:42:33,848
able to produce up to 15 seconds of quality footage a day

877
00:42:33,988 --> 00:42:34,348
for Quill.

878
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,292
And that really made the difference

879
00:42:38,312 --> 00:42:39,633
for trying to get this game done on time.

880
00:42:41,545 --> 00:42:44,347
So rethinking the animation pipeline and the need

881
00:42:44,387 --> 00:42:46,769
for Maya files, preventing animation rigs

882
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:49,671
from becoming overly complex and constraining,

883
00:42:50,632 --> 00:42:52,233
allowing for space switching, which in turn

884
00:42:52,273 --> 00:42:55,876
enables us to do outright automation of the animation

885
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:56,356
process.

886
00:42:56,937 --> 00:42:58,978
This is how I was able to accomplish the one-man team

887
00:42:59,018 --> 00:43:02,040
approach and how we were able to work iteratively

888
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,903
without animation ever becoming a blocking issue for design

889
00:43:04,943 --> 00:43:05,483
or engineering.

890
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:09,446
And unlike characters from film, TV, and books,

891
00:43:10,516 --> 00:43:11,996
Quill isn't just a character you witness.

892
00:43:13,237 --> 00:43:16,178
With those formats, you follow a character on their adventure.

893
00:43:16,478 --> 00:43:17,838
You're a passive observer.

894
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:20,819
Quill is not just a character you control in a game.

895
00:43:21,639 --> 00:43:24,260
With a traditional game format, gameplay mechanics and story

896
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,121
events, they take center stage as the character becomes

897
00:43:27,161 --> 00:43:28,541
your avatar into that world.

898
00:43:29,462 --> 00:43:31,602
Quill is a living, breathing character

899
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:33,843
who you'll interact with in meaningful ways

900
00:43:34,263 --> 00:43:35,743
while you guide her on your shared adventure.

901
00:43:36,704 --> 00:43:37,144
And that.

902
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:38,992
is why this girl's crying.

903
00:43:56,017 --> 00:43:57,478
So this session is one of two talks

904
00:43:57,498 --> 00:43:58,519
that Polyer is doing this year.

905
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:01,800
If you missed it yesterday, Brendan Walker

906
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:04,602
did a great talk on a lot of the back end

907
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,623
and how we hooked up a lot of the information for Quill.

908
00:44:06,943 --> 00:44:08,864
And it was a good companion talk to this.

909
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,886
And he also talks a lot about how to wipe tears from headsets.

910
00:44:15,268 --> 00:44:16,909
So questions?

911
00:44:34,512 --> 00:44:40,014
Hello. This is more of a design question, but with this sort of strong relationship

912
00:44:40,034 --> 00:44:45,336
you've established with Quill and the players for future games or places where she might

913
00:44:45,376 --> 00:44:50,537
show up, have you thought about persistence? Like if I play a game later with Quill, will

914
00:44:50,577 --> 00:44:53,158
she recognize me from our experiences in the first game?

915
00:44:54,118 --> 00:44:56,279
That's a great idea. That really is.

916
00:44:57,495 --> 00:45:00,897
It's something that we've actually discussed in the past.

917
00:45:01,117 --> 00:45:04,139
So the question was, are we going to maintain persistence

918
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,260
with Quill in future products?

919
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,182
And the answer essentially is yes.

920
00:45:08,062 --> 00:45:09,984
And we're trying to figure out what that means at this point.

921
00:45:12,886 --> 00:45:13,626
This is amazing.

922
00:45:14,387 --> 00:45:16,508
I'm sure we'll all understand if the answer is no,

923
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,169
but are you making any of your rigging

924
00:45:18,209 --> 00:45:19,390
scripts available publicly?

925
00:45:20,111 --> 00:45:20,931
I don't think you'd want them.

926
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,142
I'm such a poor scripter and rigger that you guys would

927
00:45:27,162 --> 00:45:28,603
laugh your butts off if you saw my scripts.

928
00:45:28,763 --> 00:45:31,966
But I do know that some people on the internet have seen my

929
00:45:32,266 --> 00:45:36,529
Vimeo tutorials and have made marketable scripts off of

930
00:45:36,589 --> 00:45:37,150
those videos.

931
00:45:38,691 --> 00:45:41,813
Yuri Monturi, I don't know, he's a Spanish dude.

932
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,154
I'm not saying his name properly, I'm sure.

933
00:45:43,194 --> 00:45:45,216
But you could look him up.

934
00:45:45,256 --> 00:45:48,118
And the physics script for the ears and the body is

935
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:48,858
available through him.

936
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:50,239
Thank you.

937
00:45:59,702 --> 00:46:01,324
Wow, looks like we're wrapping it up pretty quickly here.

938
00:46:04,688 --> 00:46:05,710
All right, well, I guess we'll call it.

939
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:08,714
So if you have any questions that you don't want to say out

940
00:46:08,754 --> 00:46:09,995
loud on the mic, come see me.

941
00:46:10,316 --> 00:46:11,718
And thanks for being here, everybody.

942
00:46:11,758 --> 00:46:13,099
It's been my pleasure to be here.
