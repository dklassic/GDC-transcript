1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,260
Okay, so my name is Grant Duncan,

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,081
and I'm the art director at Hello Games.

3
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:13,161
And it's been a little bit strange for me today

4
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:18,082
because I've been surrounded by art directors

5
00:00:18,142 --> 00:00:20,623
from Naughty Dog, from BioWare,

6
00:00:20,703 --> 00:00:25,584
and some really amazing people with amazing teams

7
00:00:25,964 --> 00:00:28,484
and really large teams.

8
00:00:28,824 --> 00:00:33,445
And I work with, there's four artists working in our game.

9
00:00:34,426 --> 00:00:37,667
but it's a procedural game, so actually I've probably got

10
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:40,108
hundreds of thousands of artists working with me.

11
00:00:40,889 --> 00:00:42,909
Unfortunately, they're procedural artists,

12
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,590
and they're all mindless idiots,

13
00:00:46,491 --> 00:00:49,712
which means it's a bit of a challenge.

14
00:00:50,973 --> 00:00:52,793
So I'm working on a game called No Man's Sky,

15
00:00:54,134 --> 00:00:56,235
and it's a science fiction game,

16
00:00:57,495 --> 00:00:59,016
and it's a procedural game.

17
00:01:00,224 --> 00:01:02,025
And it's a game about discovery,

18
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:04,407
about exploring the unknown.

19
00:01:06,248 --> 00:01:08,450
And when I say science fiction,

20
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:11,112
it's this kind of thing.

21
00:01:11,813 --> 00:01:15,256
And I think when you often say science fiction,

22
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:17,558
people kind of picture a kind of,

23
00:01:18,518 --> 00:01:20,080
a future war, a kind of,

24
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,983
they imagine these great ships and space marines

25
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:25,925
and lots of gray and lots of black.

26
00:01:27,392 --> 00:01:29,473
And to me that's not what science fiction is.

27
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:30,994
When I think of science fiction,

28
00:01:31,774 --> 00:01:34,135
I think of like 70s book covers

29
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:38,637
and artists like Chris Foss and John Harris.

30
00:01:39,437 --> 00:01:41,098
And they were kind of artists

31
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:44,059
who became really famous in the 70s.

32
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,101
And they've kind of got a little bit lost recently.

33
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:49,942
And I think that's very sad.

34
00:01:50,062 --> 00:01:51,423
And if you look at a lot of book covers,

35
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:54,743
in those days, they were very experimental.

36
00:01:54,763 --> 00:01:56,224
They were doing lots of different things

37
00:01:56,424 --> 00:01:58,966
and a lot of the art wasn't particularly great.

38
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:01,288
It was actually a lot of bad artwork,

39
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:02,970
but they were all trying new things.

40
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,632
Whereas now it feels like science fiction

41
00:02:05,652 --> 00:02:09,395
has kind of fallen into a bit of a language in itself.

42
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:11,897
So you almost can't stray too far from that

43
00:02:11,937 --> 00:02:13,618
without people getting a little bit confused.

44
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,223
So No Man's Sky is a procedural game

45
00:02:19,263 --> 00:02:21,204
where you're in an infinite universe.

46
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,088
That's what you're seeing here.

47
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:24,149
You are here.

48
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,251
You are fairly insignificant.

49
00:02:27,932 --> 00:02:29,253
And each one of these stars,

50
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:30,854
there's millions and millions of stars,

51
00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:31,535
and when you visit them,

52
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:34,697
each star has a solar system.

53
00:02:35,177 --> 00:02:37,879
And so it has various satellites and planets,

54
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:40,281
and you can seamlessly travel between them.

55
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:42,983
And this was like a real big tech thing for us.

56
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:45,425
It was one of the first things we started working on

57
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,926
was like the terrain engine

58
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,988
and the ability to planet hop from one planet to another.

59
00:02:51,937 --> 00:02:54,540
And as far as our sort of research that we did,

60
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,422
or the kind of concepts that we went through,

61
00:02:57,764 --> 00:02:58,825
we looked at the real world.

62
00:02:58,905 --> 00:03:01,408
It's very easy when you're working on games

63
00:03:01,488 --> 00:03:03,430
to look at other games or to look at movies

64
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,634
and to kind of find yourself going down these channels,

65
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:10,598
but we really wanted to kind of keep a believability.

66
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:14,575
to create these worlds that feel like real places

67
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:16,096
that you actually want to go and explore.

68
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:17,717
And all these photos are from,

69
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,918
obviously from the real world, but if you look at them,

70
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:23,560
any one of these could be on the cover of a sci-fi magazine

71
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,620
or a sci-fi book.

72
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:27,542
One of the things from research in the real world

73
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:30,203
is you start to realize just what bonkers,

74
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,044
kind of crazy things you find,

75
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:37,127
like lava caves or these kind of limestone pools.

76
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:38,688
It becomes like...

77
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:42,802
You don't quite understand why they exist,

78
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:44,143
but when you start to delve into it,

79
00:03:44,163 --> 00:03:45,664
it all starts to make a little bit more sense.

80
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:50,366
And these planets, they wouldn't be very interesting

81
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:51,366
unless they had life.

82
00:03:51,487 --> 00:03:53,768
We wanted to have this feeling of,

83
00:03:54,388 --> 00:03:56,069
kind of like when you were a kid and you went to the beach,

84
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,790
and you'd go and sort of go up to rock pools,

85
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,952
and you'd feel like everything was very new and interesting.

86
00:04:02,977 --> 00:04:05,558
And one of the things we talk a lot about is things like

87
00:04:05,758 --> 00:04:08,580
The Journey to the Center of the Earth, or The Lost World,

88
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,601
and those kind of old movies,

89
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:13,423
or a lot of Ray Harryhausen films

90
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:16,104
where they'd find like a mysterious island,

91
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:18,846
and they'd find, they'd head off into a cave,

92
00:04:18,866 --> 00:04:20,387
and they'd find these strange creatures.

93
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:25,369
So we'd look at real world creatures, and we'd try to...

94
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:28,289
And we're not going for the real world

95
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,310
just because we wanted to stay away from alien things,

96
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,130
but what we wanted to do was to find,

97
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,371
to keep that believability, that we can create these rules

98
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:39,012
and we can make believable creatures,

99
00:04:39,032 --> 00:04:40,112
and then we can break those rules

100
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:41,632
to make more alien-feeling things.

101
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,513
One of the things with procedural generation,

102
00:04:46,273 --> 00:04:49,794
when we first started, was I worked with a team of coders,

103
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:53,315
and they'd just casually talk about it

104
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:54,975
and be like, oh, how many plants are we gonna have?

105
00:04:55,718 --> 00:04:57,680
and they'd be, oh, we're gonna have 18 quintillion planets.

106
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:01,083
And I'm not particularly into maths,

107
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:03,144
but I wrote down the number to try to work out

108
00:05:03,184 --> 00:05:04,225
how many zeros that was.

109
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:08,668
And it's, one of those numbers that's so big,

110
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:10,550
it becomes entirely meaningless.

111
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,772
Like, you can write it down,

112
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:13,952
you can even try to think about it,

113
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:16,034
but it's just, it's a pointless number,

114
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:17,215
because it's just really big.

115
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:22,299
But it's also not ridiculous, because it's just maths.

116
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:24,741
It's just two to the power of 64, so it's just.

117
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:28,465
a case of having the length of a seed of a random planet,

118
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:31,909
and when you put it in those terms, it stops being insane.

119
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,752
And also, because there's four artists working on the game,

120
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:37,595
we only have to do 4.5 quintillion each,

121
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:38,916
and we'll be absolutely fine.

122
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,463
So when they first started talking to me

123
00:05:45,503 --> 00:05:46,564
about this procedural thing,

124
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,105
because the way it worked was that Sean,

125
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:49,227
one of our coders, he was...

126
00:05:50,258 --> 00:05:52,920
dabbling around in his spare time with procedural technology

127
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,961
and I didn't really know what it meant.

128
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:58,703
And actually, after kind of announcing No Man's Sky,

129
00:05:58,724 --> 00:05:59,844
and if you read any of the comments,

130
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:02,406
it turns out that nobody really seems to know

131
00:06:02,426 --> 00:06:04,067
what procedural generation actually means.

132
00:06:04,627 --> 00:06:05,888
Because it doesn't just mean random,

133
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:07,329
you can have random elements.

134
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,566
And it's not different every time.

135
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:11,128
It's essentially just maths.

136
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:12,931
And what it actually is, is just,

137
00:06:13,612 --> 00:06:16,135
rather than things being hand-created by artists,

138
00:06:16,396 --> 00:06:18,599
they're created by algorithms and rules.

139
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,443
And they're what dictate what you end up with at the end.

140
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:25,857
and I still didn't really understand procedural generation.

141
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:28,719
In fact, the guys, the coders,

142
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:31,500
they must have tried to explain it to me hundreds of times.

143
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:34,382
And Dave, he's a guy I've known for a long time,

144
00:06:34,482 --> 00:06:37,163
he took it upon himself to just try

145
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:38,564
over and over and over again

146
00:06:38,604 --> 00:06:40,105
to really get me to understand

147
00:06:40,285 --> 00:06:42,446
what they were trying to force me to do.

148
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:43,466
Because I was quite reluctant,

149
00:06:43,506 --> 00:06:45,287
because I think a lot of artists

150
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:48,189
are a little bit intimidated by procedural generation.

151
00:06:49,594 --> 00:06:52,020
it's very alien and it takes a lot of control away from us,

152
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,009
but Dave explained it to me as a big box of maths.

153
00:06:57,312 --> 00:06:58,454
And that didn't make me feel any better

154
00:06:58,474 --> 00:07:00,058
because I'm not particularly good at maths, so.

155
00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:04,581
But the way he explained it was you take all these random elements.

156
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:06,862
So in our game we'll have like creatures,

157
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,865
trees, rocks, props, terrain,

158
00:07:09,965 --> 00:07:11,626
skies, space and all those things.

159
00:07:12,407 --> 00:07:15,089
And you funnel it all into a box of maths.

160
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,312
Turn the box on and it applies all the rules

161
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:19,533
of our universe.

162
00:07:20,494 --> 00:07:22,315
And then it spits out a seed value.

163
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:24,397
And that value is the same every time.

164
00:07:24,437 --> 00:07:26,879
So if I give you the seed value and you've got the same box of maths,

165
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,922
you'll get exactly the same planet or the same universe in this case.

166
00:07:31,032 --> 00:07:35,057
And that's not an unusual thing for a procedural system to be doing.

167
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,343
So people use procedural for quite a lot of different things.

168
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:40,845
Like this is a game called Minecraft.

169
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:44,130
Yeah, you guys might have heard of it.

170
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,753
And it uses procedural technology.

171
00:07:47,825 --> 00:07:50,227
in a slightly different way in that you'll load up Minecraft

172
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:51,988
and it'll be a different seed every time,

173
00:07:52,048 --> 00:07:52,848
so a different planet.

174
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:55,750
And depending what biome you're loading,

175
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:57,731
you'll get a different kind of terrain

176
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:59,513
and trees are placed differently.

177
00:07:59,573 --> 00:08:02,614
And that's just each biome having a different set of rules

178
00:08:02,654 --> 00:08:05,896
that dictate how that world is made and how it is decorated.

179
00:08:07,017 --> 00:08:08,178
And so as you're flying along,

180
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:11,100
like the Minecraft worlds, they're not stored anywhere.

181
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,500
They are being generated as you're

182
00:08:13,321 --> 00:08:14,221
traveling across the terrain.

183
00:08:17,617 --> 00:08:19,759
People also use it to create cities and buildings,

184
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,040
like in the top left there, that's ProcWorld.

185
00:08:22,901 --> 00:08:24,302
And you guys should look at that,

186
00:08:24,322 --> 00:08:25,503
because it's really amazing.

187
00:08:26,343 --> 00:08:27,824
He's doing some really interesting things

188
00:08:27,844 --> 00:08:29,045
with ruins and buildings.

189
00:08:29,105 --> 00:08:31,367
And in the bottom right, that's a city generator,

190
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:33,408
which is by Chris DeLay from Introversion.

191
00:08:33,548 --> 00:08:35,410
He was just kind of dabbling around with it.

192
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,492
And none of those things are stored anywhere.

193
00:08:38,532 --> 00:08:39,573
It's just, you'll click a button,

194
00:08:39,613 --> 00:08:41,054
and it'll randomly populate.

195
00:08:42,214 --> 00:08:44,656
And you can see in the left, you can also use

196
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:48,086
procedural generation with handmade assets.

197
00:08:48,307 --> 00:08:51,169
So you can construct a building and you can hand make

198
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:55,071
like walls, windows, doors, and anyone who's worked

199
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:56,873
with like tile sets or modular systems

200
00:08:56,933 --> 00:08:58,394
will be looking at that and thinking,

201
00:08:58,434 --> 00:09:00,715
yep, that's, you know, we all do that.

202
00:09:01,256 --> 00:09:03,557
But what's clever is that you use what's called an L system,

203
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:06,680
which is just a very simple scripting system

204
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,920
to dictate how

205
00:09:08,951 --> 00:09:11,173
those elements get put together to create a building.

206
00:09:11,253 --> 00:09:15,178
So it's a really basic one would be you have walls,

207
00:09:15,218 --> 00:09:16,779
you have a door, you have a window, and you have a roof,

208
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,882
and then you've got a very simple little house.

209
00:09:18,982 --> 00:09:21,444
And obviously, the more rules you have,

210
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:24,548
the more complicated you can create buildings.

211
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,414
So yeah, I was still a little bit skeptical.

212
00:09:32,286 --> 00:09:33,246
for obvious reasons.

213
00:09:33,446 --> 00:09:36,287
So I decided that I'd ask a load of my artist friends

214
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:38,588
what they thought about procedural art,

215
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:41,229
or whether I was insane for getting involved.

216
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:48,271
And yeah, I got this response quite a lot.

217
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:51,672
And not many people could actually explain to me

218
00:09:51,752 --> 00:09:52,692
why they felt this way,

219
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:56,093
but I'm not sure whether it was kind of,

220
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:57,914
it was quite aggressive, some of them as well.

221
00:09:57,954 --> 00:10:00,935
It felt like they were almost being affronted

222
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:01,835
or being attacked.

223
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,063
But this seemed to explain it a little bit more.

224
00:10:06,264 --> 00:10:07,425
And it's kind of unfair.

225
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:10,327
A lot of people were saying, it's just a load of programmer

226
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:10,627
art.

227
00:10:10,647 --> 00:10:13,009
It's just endless, boring terrains,

228
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,991
blobby-looking creatures.

229
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,214
And taking control away from artists

230
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:21,096
was the number one thing that people seemed to be scared of.

231
00:10:22,137 --> 00:10:24,519
And I think the reason that people are thinking this

232
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:24,899
is that.

233
00:10:26,323 --> 00:10:32,088
it's true like a lot of our sort of tech in games that you'll see it's very driven by programmers and a lot of

234
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:37,632
like it's always like they are at the forefront and they are pushing the boundaries and it takes a while for

235
00:10:38,493 --> 00:10:42,336
artists to get involved to make something a bit more visually interesting so they're

236
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,520
Not necessarily interested in the way it looks but they're very interested in the systems behind it

237
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:51,395
And often that's why you end up with sort of that realistic style because they want,

238
00:10:52,016 --> 00:10:55,498
they're often doing simulations of the real world and they're trying to make believable

239
00:10:55,538 --> 00:11:01,782
terrain with realistic grass and that often ends up with quite stagnant looking visuals

240
00:11:01,842 --> 00:11:04,124
and that's not very interesting to us as artists.

241
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:10,668
Something else a lot of people seemed to think was that procedural technology is random.

242
00:11:11,362 --> 00:11:16,565
I think they'd imagine that you had like a button that you'd press and it would just randomly

243
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,327
make a load of trees, it would randomly make a load of terrain and just

244
00:11:21,107 --> 00:11:23,308
plonk it all in and whatever you ended up with at the end

245
00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:25,570
you had to stay with, you had no control.

246
00:11:29,142 --> 00:11:31,764
And I think that's because the truth is,

247
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:33,706
we're actually all control freaks as artists.

248
00:11:34,286 --> 00:11:37,028
We're so used to having complete control

249
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:38,389
of every single pixel.

250
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:40,971
Like, especially now as digital artists,

251
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:43,373
we can go into Photoshop, we can zoom right in

252
00:11:43,793 --> 00:11:45,315
and be completely obsessed over something

253
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:46,616
no one else will ever care about.

254
00:11:47,897 --> 00:11:51,299
And procedural art is kind of the opposite of that,

255
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,360
but it's not.

256
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:56,183
And you have to, like I really love procedural art now,

257
00:11:56,223 --> 00:11:58,385
but it's definitely required a bit of an attitude change.

258
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,051
This isn't a very good analogy.

259
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:06,832
I think I was actually hungry when I was thinking about

260
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:07,953
how to explain this.

261
00:12:09,134 --> 00:12:10,715
But, if you imagine

262
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:12,516
like we have

263
00:12:13,516 --> 00:12:14,417
every prop in our game

264
00:12:14,797 --> 00:12:16,738
can be random and can be varied.

265
00:12:16,758 --> 00:12:19,179
So you can click on, you can have like a tree

266
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:20,720
and you can be just clicking a button and it will be

267
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,241
constantly giving you a new tree.

268
00:12:23,181 --> 00:12:24,722
And you can do that for creatures, for props,

269
00:12:24,762 --> 00:12:26,683
for planets and all the different

270
00:12:26,803 --> 00:12:28,044
ecosystems and all that kind of thing.

271
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:29,825
And if you put that all together

272
00:12:30,962 --> 00:12:34,425
without adding any kind of rules or boundaries,

273
00:12:34,465 --> 00:12:36,968
then you just end up with this ugly mess.

274
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:39,030
It's kind of the same as when you're painting.

275
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,212
If you mix all the colors together,

276
00:12:40,272 --> 00:12:42,374
you'll just get this ugly kind of brown sludge.

277
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:46,478
So we knew we had to kind of think of a way

278
00:12:46,538 --> 00:12:48,160
of stopping that from happening.

279
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:52,144
So we have what we call our blueprint system.

280
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,297
which is essentially like a template system

281
00:12:56,337 --> 00:12:58,218
and it's applied to absolutely everything you see

282
00:12:58,438 --> 00:13:01,040
in the game, except for like the terrain,

283
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,682
so it's all like, all the props and creatures

284
00:13:03,702 --> 00:13:05,383
and spaceships and those kind of things.

285
00:13:06,103 --> 00:13:07,945
And the way it works is that an artist creates

286
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:11,047
like a base template and then our system

287
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:14,549
will spit out variations.

288
00:13:14,569 --> 00:13:15,670
And the way it does this, it can...

289
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:20,768
apply things like bone scaling or apply different materials,

290
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:23,210
different layered materials, and it means you can get

291
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,071
lots of different looking objects

292
00:13:26,232 --> 00:13:27,993
without having to go in and hand make them all.

293
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,816
So here's an example of it working.

294
00:13:33,276 --> 00:13:35,217
So on the left is what an artist would have made,

295
00:13:35,418 --> 00:13:37,239
probably blocked out in ZBrush.

296
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,940
And then on the right you see it gets morphed,

297
00:13:40,621 --> 00:13:43,022
then it gets randomly picked accessories

298
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:44,904
depending on the kind of climate it's part of.

299
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:52,533
And then to the right, you can see it gets picked what kind of material, what kind of skin it has, and then it has markings.

300
00:13:52,573 --> 00:14:02,803
And the two on the right are the bone scaling system, and it just randomly picks its shape to get some very different silhouettes.

301
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:07,287
And you can see the same being applied to trees.

302
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:08,608
So you have...

303
00:14:09,988 --> 00:14:12,729
They're both exactly the same, except that,

304
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,009
so they come from the same trunk,

305
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,170
and they get different branches picked,

306
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,171
and different leaves, and then different materials,

307
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,031
and then you can see at the very end,

308
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:23,912
it gets the bone scaling and the different poses selected.

309
00:14:24,652 --> 00:14:26,432
And this is just one tree.

310
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:28,873
Obviously, we can produce hundreds of thousands

311
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:31,413
of different kinds, and it's all based on libraries,

312
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:35,955
so we have libraries of hundreds of kinds of bark textures,

313
00:14:36,015 --> 00:14:37,595
and bark materials, and moss,

314
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:39,275
and all these different rules.

315
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,121
This is a view of it in-game.

316
00:14:43,021 --> 00:14:44,962
And one of the things with the creatures in particular

317
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:48,644
is that in researching different skeletons,

318
00:14:48,724 --> 00:14:49,705
because we're such a small team,

319
00:14:49,725 --> 00:14:51,245
we have to be really careful

320
00:14:51,726 --> 00:14:53,166
not to make too much work for ourselves.

321
00:14:55,124 --> 00:15:00,048
and one of those things is that we try to share as much as many of the rigs as possible so there's

322
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:05,954
like the antelopes would share with like horses and cows and the more we delved into the more

323
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:13,000
you actually realize that a lot of creatures they have pretty much the same skeleton and the only

324
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,484
difference being or the main difference being obviously you'll get subtle differences like

325
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:17,384
number of vertebrae but

326
00:15:18,477 --> 00:15:20,478
If you have a system that can move bones around

327
00:15:20,738 --> 00:15:21,739
and can lengthen bones,

328
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,600
and if you have a good enough IK system,

329
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,041
then you can actually get

330
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:27,562
hundreds of different kinds of creatures

331
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:28,643
just based on one rig.

332
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:30,544
So the way we do that is we have,

333
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:33,726
we create a base rig, a base template,

334
00:15:34,327 --> 00:15:36,388
and then we apply all these different things over the top.

335
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:38,609
So we have like different poses,

336
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,631
so you can have a creature that is maybe more cow-like,

337
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:42,732
so it'll be hunched over,

338
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:45,474
and maybe you want to have like a sort of stallion,

339
00:15:45,554 --> 00:15:47,495
so it'll be more proud and it'll be upright.

340
00:15:48,608 --> 00:15:50,209
And because we can add these over the top,

341
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:52,191
it means we don't have to create hundreds of different walk

342
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,432
cycles and run cycles.

343
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,134
We do have a load of different ones,

344
00:15:56,174 --> 00:15:57,075
depending on the creature.

345
00:15:57,135 --> 00:15:59,317
Because we have bone scaling, if you make a creature really fat,

346
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:00,958
we can automatically make it start

347
00:16:00,998 --> 00:16:02,179
to lumber a little bit more.

348
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:03,620
But if you make it really thin, maybe you

349
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:06,023
want it to bounce a lot, like a little gazelle or something

350
00:16:06,043 --> 00:16:06,303
like that.

351
00:16:07,984 --> 00:16:12,428
And this shows our shark rig.

352
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:15,570
And that also gets used for dolphins, whales,

353
00:16:15,631 --> 00:16:16,551
and some more.

354
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:19,251
prehistoric or alien looking creatures.

355
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:21,572
And the same way, this would just be

356
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:25,555
one little blueprint really quickly made by an artist.

357
00:16:25,956 --> 00:16:28,258
And because we have like a material library,

358
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,680
so this guy will be using like probably underwater scales.

359
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,102
And we have different markings

360
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:35,483
which are all procedure generated.

361
00:16:36,484 --> 00:16:39,846
And all those things like fins and little spikes,

362
00:16:39,886 --> 00:16:42,148
they're all, we just have libraries

363
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:44,170
of hundreds of these things and they can all be applied.

364
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,551
And it's pretty cool.

365
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:52,242
the same way the ships, this is an example of the fighter class of ships

366
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:56,144
they're a little bit, they work a bit more simple than

367
00:16:56,924 --> 00:17:00,306
the creatures in that we'll have, depending on the type

368
00:17:00,706 --> 00:17:05,188
we'll have a few rules like the fire will have a cockpit, it'll have a nose, it'll have

369
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:05,788
engines

370
00:17:07,248 --> 00:17:10,070
and that way even though you're getting all these different looking ships

371
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:14,031
there's kind of a consistency there so you know just from looking at the silhouette

372
00:17:14,531 --> 00:17:16,312
what kind of ship it is you're chasing after

373
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,620
And when we're building the creatures,

374
00:17:22,661 --> 00:17:24,082
we do a lot of planning,

375
00:17:24,682 --> 00:17:26,964
because based on that one little blueprint,

376
00:17:27,484 --> 00:17:29,365
you're gonna get all these different variations.

377
00:17:29,425 --> 00:17:32,167
If you don't, if you do that blueprint badly,

378
00:17:32,447 --> 00:17:34,449
you'll just end up with hundreds of thousands

379
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:35,669
of really shit-looking creatures,

380
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,811
which you don't really want.

381
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:39,172
And actually, that's one of the things

382
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:42,714
about procedural generation, is that it is incredibly good

383
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:44,896
and incredibly fast at making really shit art.

384
00:17:45,116 --> 00:17:46,256
You would not believe how fast it is.

385
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,712
So in this situation, you can sort of see on the left,

386
00:17:49,852 --> 00:17:51,253
even early on, we were thinking about

387
00:17:51,694 --> 00:17:54,056
what kind of creatures can we share rigs with?

388
00:17:54,216 --> 00:17:57,298
So we'll have like lizards, chameleons, frogs,

389
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:59,000
and duck-billed platypuses.

390
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,222
These are all like Earth-like creatures,

391
00:18:01,322 --> 00:18:04,424
but again, our thinking was, or our logic was,

392
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:06,987
if we can learn the rules to create creatures

393
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:08,087
that you see on Earth,

394
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,590
then it's really easy to then bend those rules

395
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:11,991
and to go to extremes to make

396
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:13,692
a lot more alien-looking variations.

397
00:18:16,646 --> 00:18:20,907
This is the, some of the concepts when you're first starting out in the sharks and the whales.

398
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:36,730
So yeah, at this stage we had a very ugly soup. So we have the trees, you can be clicking on

399
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,731
view variants, you're getting hundreds of thousands of different looking trees,

400
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:44,272
lots of different looking creatures, very varied so it's not just

401
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:45,492
hue shifting and...

402
00:18:46,434 --> 00:18:49,116
the actual silhouettes are changing a lot in the scales and you're getting...

403
00:18:50,116 --> 00:18:53,939
I was really impressed at this stage, but I was still really scared and very worried because

404
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,362
when you put it all together in a game, it's just

405
00:18:58,863 --> 00:19:00,825
a big, ugly mess.

406
00:19:01,085 --> 00:19:04,668
So everything is colorful, everything... none of the shapes, there's no consistency.

407
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,572
Luckily, I work with some very talented coders.

408
00:19:10,813 --> 00:19:12,314
So the way we do things is that...

409
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,288
I'd create a lot of objects we put them in game and then I'd known to the coders

410
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,834
and they fight back and it will be a lot of back and forth but

411
00:19:22,736 --> 00:19:26,102
it was a very useful process because it meant.

412
00:19:27,238 --> 00:19:29,340
There's loads of things I would do as an artist, and

413
00:19:30,061 --> 00:19:32,523
if a lot of you guys have been environment artists or anything like that,

414
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,745
you'll do loads of little things that you maybe don't realize you do

415
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,347
just because you know it works. So things like

416
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:40,549
you'll put a tree down and you'll

417
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:42,791
add a little bit of grass at the base of it, and you'll

418
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:44,452
add a few little rocks, and you'll

419
00:19:44,872 --> 00:19:46,434
put some bushes, and you'll

420
00:19:46,474 --> 00:19:48,215
just be picking out these silhouettes, and

421
00:19:48,715 --> 00:19:51,918
with a procedural system, none of that happens unless you tell it to happen.

422
00:19:52,738 --> 00:19:56,000
So what we'd do is we'd have, like a tree would get placed,

423
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,321
I would then paint over it, and I'd talk to the coders

424
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:02,022
about how do we make it so that this is more likely

425
00:20:02,062 --> 00:20:04,944
to happen, and we'd slowly build up this kind of list

426
00:20:04,984 --> 00:20:08,465
of rules that we would apply to the procedural system

427
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:11,166
to make it more likely to produce the results

428
00:20:11,186 --> 00:20:13,487
that I would get if I was doing it by hand,

429
00:20:13,507 --> 00:20:14,808
if that makes sense.

430
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:22,173
So this is an example of some of the rules that we put in place.

431
00:20:23,074 --> 00:20:25,636
So when a planet gets generated, it picks...

432
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,158
it has a climate and an ecosystem,

433
00:20:28,358 --> 00:20:31,860
and a lot of that kind of thing is dictated by how close to the sun it is

434
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,003
or how close to the moon it has, and all this kind of thing.

435
00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:37,925
And in this case, it's like a swamp-like planet,

436
00:20:38,185 --> 00:20:40,046
so it'll have a lot of fog.

437
00:20:41,007 --> 00:20:42,608
What we want for that kind of planet is that

438
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,550
for the props that get selected or generated

439
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,992
and for the kind of creatures that you find in that planet,

440
00:20:49,075 --> 00:20:51,881
for it to be consistent, for it to be,

441
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:53,204
just for you to accept it,

442
00:20:53,224 --> 00:20:54,667
for you to not think it's unusual.

443
00:20:55,842 --> 00:20:58,725
And so it kind of, we tag things.

444
00:20:59,445 --> 00:21:02,729
So you'd have like lizards and amphibians,

445
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:05,832
you can see if you've got a waxy sort of damp skin.

446
00:21:06,533 --> 00:21:07,714
And also things like the colors

447
00:21:08,094 --> 00:21:09,696
and the type of trees that have been picked.

448
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:14,140
So we'll have like swampy sort of hanging bushes and trees.

449
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:16,102
And then some of the red from the leaves

450
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,224
will be added to the creatures

451
00:21:17,304 --> 00:21:19,045
just as almost like a natural camouflage.

452
00:21:19,973 --> 00:21:23,814
We can also have the opposite of that, where if we want a creature or an object to really stand out,

453
00:21:23,894 --> 00:21:28,935
we can have it pick like a complementary color, so we can have like a bright blue frog or that kind of thing.

454
00:21:31,596 --> 00:21:36,297
And actually, one of the things we are the most back and forth on has been

455
00:21:37,657 --> 00:21:41,198
placement of objects. And it's not something you'd think would be that big a deal,

456
00:21:41,238 --> 00:21:44,239
but on procedural things, especially on a game that's all about terrain,

457
00:21:45,219 --> 00:21:46,980
it becomes this huge deal and...

458
00:21:47,918 --> 00:21:50,481
procedural systems use like noise functions,

459
00:21:50,661 --> 00:21:52,203
and that's how you place objects on the terrain.

460
00:21:52,704 --> 00:21:54,566
And those naturally mean you get this kind of

461
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:58,451
random scattering, which is never particularly pleasing, so.

462
00:22:00,223 --> 00:22:02,785
anyone who's worked in environment art knows that you have this clumping

463
00:22:03,145 --> 00:22:04,266
that you'll do where you place

464
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:08,410
large objects and you place medium objects around them and then smaller objects.

465
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,752
It's just something that everyone who works in environment art knows

466
00:22:11,513 --> 00:22:13,174
but a procedural system has no knowledge of that.

467
00:22:14,035 --> 00:22:15,737
So because our props are all based on

468
00:22:16,818 --> 00:22:20,361
they have an understanding of what shape they are, what their volume is, it means our

469
00:22:20,401 --> 00:22:21,402
procedural system can...

470
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:25,170
it can pick an object of a certain size

471
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,291
and it understands that it wants to place

472
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:29,873
a slightly smaller version of a similar object nearby.

473
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:31,994
And it means you get this kind of clumping

474
00:22:32,014 --> 00:22:34,215
and it means you get a lot more pleasing silhouettes.

475
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:40,959
Something else we have is our color theory system.

476
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,341
And I say teaching color theory to a robot

477
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:47,123
is because it's actually quite difficult to explain.

478
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:49,625
And it means, like even when you do it yourself,

479
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:51,165
you often find yourself.

480
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,831
breaking your own rules, so it's been a real difficult thing,

481
00:22:54,891 --> 00:22:56,872
is just to come up with this system.

482
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:01,534
So for a start, there's no random colors in the game.

483
00:23:01,574 --> 00:23:02,855
Nothing random is going on.

484
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:06,976
We have custom palettes, so every material in the game,

485
00:23:07,016 --> 00:23:11,918
if it's like skin, fur, scales, rock, wood,

486
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:14,899
I have custom made all those palettes,

487
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,880
so it means there's a selection of colors

488
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,801
that you know are gonna get used,

489
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:21,202
and then each of those palettes I can dictate

490
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:24,524
how much hue variation there is within them.

491
00:23:24,584 --> 00:23:26,786
So it doesn't have to stick to those colors rigidly.

492
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:29,888
It can kind of go with a few variables.

493
00:23:31,489 --> 00:23:34,491
And it means like what color gets used in which situation.

494
00:23:35,992 --> 00:23:37,173
So with things like creatures,

495
00:23:37,994 --> 00:23:39,255
like a base color will get picked

496
00:23:40,015 --> 00:23:42,977
and then it'll often have like a lighter underside

497
00:23:43,077 --> 00:23:44,258
or maybe you want markings

498
00:23:44,899 --> 00:23:47,420
and those markings will often be like a complementary color.

499
00:23:48,421 --> 00:23:51,463
So they'll kind of blend in nicely with the objects.

500
00:23:55,385 --> 00:23:57,106
You can see the same on some of the foliage.

501
00:23:57,847 --> 00:23:59,388
And when you see it in isolation here,

502
00:24:00,068 --> 00:24:01,449
it doesn't necessarily make very much sense.

503
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:03,931
It's just like yellow leaves and blue moss.

504
00:24:04,051 --> 00:24:06,332
But because these are all linked together,

505
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,034
it means like when a planet gets generated,

506
00:24:09,554 --> 00:24:11,656
say it's got like a lot of blue minerals,

507
00:24:11,976 --> 00:24:13,737
so the ground will become this blue color.

508
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,398
And when a tree gets placed there,

509
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:17,619
it can get told to have the moss

510
00:24:17,699 --> 00:24:19,120
to pick up the color from the ground.

511
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,142
And that all, it kind of all flows through the system.

512
00:24:25,121 --> 00:24:29,628
and keeping track of all that kind of thing is really difficult because we have 18 quintillion

513
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:34,556
planets as I mentioned earlier so flying around each one of those planets and making sure the

514
00:24:34,596 --> 00:24:35,898
colors are nice becomes this

515
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:39,945
impossible task. So what we have is these little robot drones

516
00:24:40,606 --> 00:24:43,848
that we send out into the galaxy and they fly down to each planet

517
00:24:44,508 --> 00:24:48,111
and they record a little animated gif and then they spit that gif out and they

518
00:24:48,151 --> 00:24:51,934
write it to a simple little html file so I can open

519
00:24:51,974 --> 00:24:53,615
it up and then I can just have a quick look

520
00:24:53,955 --> 00:24:55,837
and I can very quickly see if there's like

521
00:24:56,637 --> 00:25:00,378
way too many red planets or trees look really ugly when they're in this color and

522
00:25:01,178 --> 00:25:05,239
I can click on that and I can get the seed value and I can then fly down to that planet and I can

523
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,080
figure out why it's happening and I can tweak the rules to try to make that less likely.

524
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:18,201
And so I think especially when it comes to art direction there's like the best games to me are

525
00:25:18,221 --> 00:25:23,002
games where you don't question anything. Things just feel like they belong together and

526
00:25:24,165 --> 00:25:28,671
I think, I actually think Nintendo are the best at this, bizarrely.

527
00:25:29,713 --> 00:25:33,017
They never talk about it, and you never see anything about their tech or anything like

528
00:25:33,037 --> 00:25:34,239
that, but they're absolutely amazing.

529
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:36,822
Everything just feels like it belongs.

530
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:40,589
and that's a very difficult thing to get with procedural stuff

531
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:45,752
because it's being generated in a way that you don't have complete control over

532
00:25:46,453 --> 00:25:49,174
so we had to find a way of grouping things together

533
00:25:49,694 --> 00:25:52,036
so when an object gets made

534
00:25:52,796 --> 00:25:54,857
things like horns you can tag

535
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:58,459
and you can sort of tag things as a certain shape and type

536
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,361
and we can... what's a good way of explaining this?

537
00:26:03,993 --> 00:26:06,134
you can have it so a creature that looks aggressive,

538
00:26:06,155 --> 00:26:08,196
so if it's got lots of teeth and lots of spikes,

539
00:26:08,396 --> 00:26:10,578
you can tag those as being hostile.

540
00:26:11,118 --> 00:26:12,980
And it means when you're generating a hostile planet,

541
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,941
it can generate more of that kind of thing.

542
00:26:15,882 --> 00:26:19,326
and it means you can get a lot more consistency.

543
00:26:19,427 --> 00:26:22,450
So things like the, you can see in this example,

544
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:25,474
the kind of trees and the little bushes,

545
00:26:25,514 --> 00:26:26,935
they've all been tagged as like,

546
00:26:27,416 --> 00:26:28,938
I imagine it's blobby in this case,

547
00:26:29,438 --> 00:26:32,162
or glowy, very highly technical terms like that.

548
00:26:32,722 --> 00:26:34,685
But it means that when it's populating a planet,

549
00:26:35,758 --> 00:26:38,818
it all feels like it belongs and the same way like these creatures you'll see

550
00:26:38,858 --> 00:26:42,939
their markings they'll have been tagged as glowy as well and it means that it

551
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:47,300
all just feels like it belongs together and it has this kind of believability

552
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:53,521
about it and here you can see some of the clumping so you'll see on the left

553
00:26:53,561 --> 00:26:58,642
a lot of those complementary bushes to the orange and the way the cave has

554
00:26:58,662 --> 00:27:02,163
been decorated that none of that's by hand it all just happens because of

555
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:07,232
various rules the same way like placement things like trees we can tell

556
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:11,473
them how far above sea level certain types of trees are more likely to be

557
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:15,834
seen or what angle certain bushes are going to grow on and those kind of rules

558
00:27:15,874 --> 00:27:20,575
have this massive knock-on I mean like if I changed like some of those rules

559
00:27:20,675 --> 00:27:26,437
it will have it's really scary it'll change every single planet so I could

560
00:27:26,457 --> 00:27:30,038
accidentally check something in and then the guys will suddenly load up a planet

561
00:27:30,078 --> 00:27:31,879
and they'll just be nothing but trees

562
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,900
he'll run about 2 frames per second.

563
00:27:38,781 --> 00:27:40,641
I think one of the things with procedural generation

564
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:43,982
that I found really, really exciting is that

565
00:27:44,742 --> 00:27:47,043
I've been working in games for a long time

566
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,043
where tools are so amazing now

567
00:27:49,123 --> 00:27:50,403
but they still feel really

568
00:27:51,684 --> 00:27:53,744
arduous. It still feels like a real slog

569
00:27:53,804 --> 00:27:55,205
to get to where you want to get.

570
00:27:55,265 --> 00:27:56,105
You're still having to

571
00:27:57,345 --> 00:28:00,026
load up ZBrush, transfer maps,

572
00:28:00,106 --> 00:28:01,246
blah, blah, blah, all this kind of thing.

573
00:28:02,773 --> 00:28:04,755
And it feels like there's more and more tools now

574
00:28:04,775 --> 00:28:07,777
that are starting to enable procedural technology,

575
00:28:07,797 --> 00:28:11,000
like the Quixel Suite, Speedtree, and Substance Design,

576
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,564
and they're kind of avoiding all these pointlessly

577
00:28:15,645 --> 00:28:17,927
long, drawn-out processes where we can just get,

578
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:21,210
we can get results without having to hand draw

579
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,971
and jump through all these technical hoops.

580
00:28:25,717 --> 00:28:28,398
I think also, one of the reasons I,

581
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,719
I'd like to first of all thank Andrew

582
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:32,980
for inviting me here,

583
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,201
because it's a bit of an unusual

584
00:28:34,681 --> 00:28:35,601
to invite me to this kind of thing.

585
00:28:36,542 --> 00:28:39,603
But I'd really like some bigger studios

586
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:41,264
to be getting involved in procedural stuff

587
00:28:41,744 --> 00:28:44,746
just because making all the tools ourselves

588
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:46,987
is really hard work.

589
00:28:47,327 --> 00:28:50,628
I know that if BioWare were to start doing some tools,

590
00:28:50,648 --> 00:28:51,669
that would be great.

591
00:28:51,709 --> 00:28:52,709
I'd like to dabble with those.

592
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:55,674
But it doesn't have to be entirely generated.

593
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,915
You can have hybrid systems.

594
00:28:56,955 --> 00:29:00,480
So you can still hand-make art, and you can still

595
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,223
have procedural systems involved in that.

596
00:29:03,865 --> 00:29:07,249
Our systems are essentially character creation tools.

597
00:29:08,021 --> 00:29:09,901
like even our tree, like every prop in game

598
00:29:10,422 --> 00:29:11,582
is just a character creator.

599
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:13,662
So you have all these different sliders,

600
00:29:14,202 --> 00:29:17,383
they all control attributes like leaf density,

601
00:29:17,723 --> 00:29:20,044
and it's all the same theory as things like

602
00:29:20,164 --> 00:29:22,784
modular character creation, which is something

603
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:24,265
we've been doing for years in games.

604
00:29:24,325 --> 00:29:27,585
So I think there's real scope for other studios

605
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:28,406
to do that kind of thing.

606
00:29:30,326 --> 00:29:33,407
And I think it really is skipping all the boring stuff.

607
00:29:34,367 --> 00:29:35,147
It feels like...

608
00:29:37,471 --> 00:29:44,073
with digital art it's very easy to get caught up in a lot of detail but it's really nice

609
00:29:44,113 --> 00:29:50,835
procedural stuff for prototyping you can really quickly get to results and it means it's not

610
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:57,377
all about adding variation like when i'm making a creature i can just throw a few shapes together

611
00:29:58,018 --> 00:30:06,280
get it in game and then hit view variations and i can just see you know fins and spikes and horns and

612
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,971
even if that was just a process for creating concept art,

613
00:30:11,271 --> 00:30:12,592
that's still a really nice system.

614
00:30:12,652 --> 00:30:13,952
It's a real fun thing to do,

615
00:30:13,992 --> 00:30:16,793
that you're just farting about, basically,

616
00:30:16,833 --> 00:30:18,533
and making all these different looking shapes.

617
00:30:19,213 --> 00:30:20,794
And you could then take that and export it

618
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:23,974
and bring it into Maya or ZBrush and then go crazy.

619
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:26,595
But as far as getting to something you're happy with,

620
00:30:27,455 --> 00:30:28,756
I think it's a really powerful tool.

621
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:32,377
So yeah, any questions?

622
00:30:56,873 --> 00:30:57,673
Oh, no time.

623
00:30:59,335 --> 00:30:59,595
OK.

624
00:31:00,595 --> 00:31:01,956
Yeah, if you'd like to ask me any questions,

625
00:31:01,996 --> 00:31:02,877
I'll be in the wrap-up room.

626
00:31:02,937 --> 00:31:05,118
I don't think we've actually got time for questions, I'm afraid.

627
00:31:05,178 --> 00:31:07,300
But yeah, if you catch me outside, I'll be there.

628
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,260
Thanks very much.
