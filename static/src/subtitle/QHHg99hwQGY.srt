1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:04,901
Welcome, everybody.

2
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:08,924
OK.

3
00:00:10,426 --> 00:00:15,170
So I am Mark Rosewater, the head designer for Magic the Gathering.

4
00:00:17,972 --> 00:00:19,693
So we do something a little weird.

5
00:00:20,794 --> 00:00:23,757
We make a game, and we put it on paper.

6
00:00:25,598 --> 00:00:27,279
You can come to the experimental game workshop.

7
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,781
It's something new, kind of cutting edge.

8
00:00:29,721 --> 00:00:33,224
So anyway, let's walk through my game employment history.

9
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:39,311
So back in 1995, I went to work for a little company called Wizards of the Coast.

10
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:42,758
That's it. That's my employment history.

11
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:52,115
So I've actually spent the last 20 years designing the same game, of course, Magic the Gathering.

12
00:00:53,056 --> 00:00:56,378
And not a lot of people actually design a game for 20 years.

13
00:00:56,398 --> 00:00:58,400
Not a lot of games last 20 years.

14
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,144
But what I found was over the years, as I worked, wizards went through a lot of changes,

15
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:07,146
and magic went through a lot of changes.

16
00:01:07,727 --> 00:01:12,070
So for example, this was one of our main villains, Nicole Bolas, when I started at the company.

17
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:14,170
And there he is now.

18
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,251
So magic has changed a lot over the years.

19
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:19,773
In fact, in the 20 years since I've been there,

20
00:01:20,393 --> 00:01:23,655
we have made 85 randomized booster products, 69

21
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:28,177
non-randomized products.

22
00:01:28,877 --> 00:01:31,339
We've done online licensing and other miscellaneous products,

23
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,480
and have produced over 14,000 cards.

24
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,281
So in 20 years, we've made a lot of magic.

25
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:42,090
So in those 20 years, I've learned a lot.

26
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,631
I've made a lot of mistakes, done a few things correct,

27
00:01:45,032 --> 00:01:46,293
but I've had a lot of lessons.

28
00:01:46,913 --> 00:01:49,975
And so I decided for my first talk ever at GDC,

29
00:01:49,995 --> 00:01:54,218
I would share those 20 years, lessons that I learned.

30
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:56,839
And I decided I would do 20 lessons.

31
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,821
I figured I could average one per year.

32
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:01,122
But this isn't chronological.

33
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:03,182
It's not like, here's the lesson of 1995.

34
00:02:04,743 --> 00:02:07,944
These are just lessons I learned over, put in an order that makes sense to me.

35
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:09,825
Hopefully by the end of this it'll make sense to you.

36
00:02:10,365 --> 00:02:12,006
But these are 20 lessons.

37
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,186
I got 60 minutes.

38
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:13,966
Go.

39
00:02:14,947 --> 00:02:16,007
Okay, lesson number one.

40
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:19,568
So for this one we're going back to time spiral, back in October of 2006.

41
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:24,350
So, we had a little mechanic, or called...

42
00:02:25,655 --> 00:02:26,255
Suspend.

43
00:02:27,135 --> 00:02:29,736
And Suspend basically lets you trade time for money.

44
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:31,816
Money and magic being mana, of course.

45
00:02:32,296 --> 00:02:34,277
So the idea essentially was, normally in magic,

46
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:36,197
you cast a spell, it happens right away.

47
00:02:36,577 --> 00:02:38,418
But Suspend said, well, it's cheaper,

48
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:40,658
but you have to wait several turns for it.

49
00:02:41,218 --> 00:02:42,459
So this is Eren Ephemeron.

50
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,519
It takes four turns once you play it.

51
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:48,240
So you cast it, wait, wait, wait.

52
00:02:50,887 --> 00:02:54,969
okay, you get Aaron Ephemeron, and then as soon as people got it, they would attack with it.

53
00:02:55,669 --> 00:02:58,651
In magic tapping, you have to turn it to attack. So they would attack with it.

54
00:02:59,932 --> 00:03:04,194
But they weren't allowed to do that, because the magic rules say you can't do that.

55
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:08,637
So we were trying to figure out how could we communicate to people not to attack?

56
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:11,279
So we tried a lot of different ways.

57
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,861
Some got less and less subtle.

58
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:15,462
To try to encourage them to say,

59
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:16,543
no, you can't attack.

60
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:17,764
You can't attack with this creature.

61
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,786
And in the end, the solution was,

62
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:23,188
no guys, you can't attack.

63
00:03:23,228 --> 00:03:24,069
And then finally we said,

64
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:25,990
okay, you can attack.

65
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,851
We'll change the rules.

66
00:03:27,231 --> 00:03:28,352
The rules just say you can attack.

67
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:30,214
You want to attack, you can attack.

68
00:03:31,074 --> 00:03:32,776
So that brings us to lesson number one.

69
00:03:34,157 --> 00:03:36,879
Fighting against human nature is a losing battle.

70
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:43,629
So they say in game design you should know your audience, so our audience is human.

71
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:50,293
And they come with a complex operating system, but while it's quirky, it is something that

72
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,173
can be understood.

73
00:03:51,193 --> 00:03:55,776
There's an entire field of psychology trying to understand it, but as game designers we

74
00:03:55,796 --> 00:03:58,597
have to be forewarned, humans can be a bit stubborn.

75
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:05,799
So what I like to say to people is, don't change your players to match your game, change

76
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:07,881
your game to match your players.

77
00:04:08,722 --> 00:04:11,726
Don't get yourself into a fight that you're probably not going to win.

78
00:04:13,244 --> 00:04:17,106
So, lesson number one, fighting against human nature is a losing battle.

79
00:04:17,647 --> 00:04:22,249
And there are things throughout time, the cell phone, there's things that get invented

80
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:23,450
that change human behavior.

81
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,812
But don't assume your game is going to be one of those things and that when you try

82
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:31,395
to make humans change for your game, your game is going to suffer.

83
00:04:31,975 --> 00:04:35,157
Change your game to match your audience, which are human.

84
00:04:36,137 --> 00:04:36,918
So here's what I'm going to do.

85
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:38,399
Each lesson I'm going to put up on the board.

86
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:41,220
And at the end, there'll be a pretty picture you guys can take of all the lessons.

87
00:04:42,337 --> 00:04:43,357
Okay, lesson number two.

88
00:04:44,277 --> 00:04:47,158
So this one goes back to 2012, Avacyn Restored.

89
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,739
So the card I got the most complaints about

90
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:52,759
was a card called Gristlebrand.

91
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:55,300
In fact, I got way more complaints about this card

92
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,240
than any other card.

93
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,100
Why?

94
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,080
Was it a power level issue?

95
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:01,801
Well, no, here's Jerry Thompson, a very good magic player,

96
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:04,522
a whole article explaining how awesome Gristlebrand is.

97
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:06,222
Gristlebrand's a very powerful card.

98
00:05:06,442 --> 00:05:08,683
In certain formats, it's actually very, very strong.

99
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,863
Okay, was it a flavor thing?

100
00:05:10,883 --> 00:05:10,923
No.

101
00:05:12,798 --> 00:05:14,859
Liliana is one of our most popular characters.

102
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:19,562
In fact, she made a deal with four demons to get eternal youth and beauty.

103
00:05:20,143 --> 00:05:22,724
And he was one of the four demons she made a deal with.

104
00:05:22,985 --> 00:05:24,365
So no, he's super flavorful.

105
00:05:24,846 --> 00:05:25,786
So what was going on?

106
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:30,830
Well, he was a seven power creature with seven toughness.

107
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,592
You could pay seven life to draw seven cards.

108
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,754
And he cost eight mana.

109
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:41,316
So lesson number two.

110
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:44,001
Aesthetics matter.

111
00:05:45,362 --> 00:05:48,443
So I just explained how you have to understand human behavior, that's important.

112
00:05:49,024 --> 00:05:51,085
But you also have to understand human aesthetics.

113
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:52,625
I'm sorry, human perception.

114
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:53,386
I'm getting ahead of myself.

115
00:05:53,646 --> 00:05:55,066
You have to understand human perception.

116
00:05:55,547 --> 00:05:58,088
So I went to Boston University College of Communications.

117
00:05:58,488 --> 00:05:59,608
I took a lot of classes there.

118
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:04,591
So one of the classes I took was a class called Aesthetics, which is also known as the Philosophy

119
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:04,731
of Art.

120
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:06,871
or the science of beauty.

121
00:06:07,632 --> 00:06:10,672
And the idea of aesthetics is they study how humans perceive the world.

122
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,873
You literally study like, how does the brain work?

123
00:06:12,913 --> 00:06:13,813
How do the senses work?

124
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:14,933
How do the eyes, the ears?

125
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:15,994
How does it all come together?

126
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:17,794
How do people perceive the things around them?

127
00:06:18,154 --> 00:06:21,875
And what they do is they look at all the different qualities that humans cross-culture

128
00:06:22,135 --> 00:06:26,376
and they try to figure out what exactly to humans is aesthetically pleasing.

129
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:29,737
And while there's some variance from person to person, there are just...

130
00:06:30,705 --> 00:06:35,130
Things about the way the human brain works that make certain things more appealing than others.

131
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,075
So in your game, players expect the components of the game to have a certain feel.

132
00:06:40,996 --> 00:06:44,240
Now, I'm not talking about just visual aesthetics. Magic actually does that pretty well.

133
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,264
But I'm talking about whether the game component has the right qualities.

134
00:06:48,644 --> 00:06:49,986
It has to feel right.

135
00:06:50,685 --> 00:06:55,026
You know, things like balance, symmetry, pattern completion.

136
00:06:55,786 --> 00:06:58,006
And if you fail to provide the aesthetics you want,

137
00:06:58,526 --> 00:07:00,167
it makes the players feel ill at ease,

138
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:02,807
it distracts them from the focus of your game,

139
00:07:03,447 --> 00:07:05,548
and it makes them pay attention to what the game isn't

140
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:06,968
instead of what the game is.

141
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:09,888
So I just said, don't fight human nature,

142
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:12,309
don't fight human perception.

143
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:15,430
So lesson number two, aesthetics matter.

144
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:20,932
The key element here is that humans like to perceive things in a certain way,

145
00:07:21,192 --> 00:07:24,374
and if you fight that, it just draws attention away.

146
00:07:24,714 --> 00:07:27,076
Now, you might make your game because you want to do that.

147
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:28,597
Maybe you want them to feel ill at ease.

148
00:07:28,777 --> 00:07:30,778
That's okay. You can use this to your advantage.

149
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,081
But be aware that how people perceive things affects how they take your game in,

150
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:39,244
and that don't disconnect from the aesthetics unless you mean to,

151
00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:41,145
because otherwise it just draws focus.

152
00:07:42,606 --> 00:07:44,407
Okay, lesson number two, aesthetics matter.

153
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:44,988
Up on the wall.

154
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:47,317
Lesson number three.

155
00:07:47,798 --> 00:07:50,061
So for this one, we go back to Innistrad and Dark Ascension.

156
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:51,283
This is back in 2011, 2012.

157
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:54,608
So this was our gothic horror sets.

158
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:57,953
We had vampires, and werewolves, and zombies.

159
00:07:58,634 --> 00:08:01,438
So one of the things I did very early in this design team is

160
00:08:02,318 --> 00:08:05,359
On the whiteboard we wrote up just cool sounding names,

161
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,060
just things that sounded evocative.

162
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,842
And then a lot of the cards, a lot of the popular cards

163
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:12,683
from the set came from that whiteboard

164
00:08:12,903 --> 00:08:15,505
that we would put things up and we would design to match it.

165
00:08:15,825 --> 00:08:18,166
And we ended up with a lot of very evocative cards,

166
00:08:18,466 --> 00:08:19,707
some of the favorite cards in the set.

167
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:21,868
And it all came from just matching

168
00:08:21,888 --> 00:08:24,590
the idea of what sounded cool, what

169
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,190
would make a cool sounding card.

170
00:08:27,371 --> 00:08:28,872
So I guess it's a lesson number three.

171
00:08:29,852 --> 00:08:31,633
Resonance is important.

172
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:33,883
Okay, so I'm going to use a lot of metaphors.

173
00:08:34,183 --> 00:08:35,464
So one of my metaphors is,

174
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:38,946
humans, your audience, the people who are going to play your games,

175
00:08:39,506 --> 00:08:40,526
come pre-loaded.

176
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:43,888
Designers don't have to start from scratch.

177
00:08:44,368 --> 00:08:47,490
That the audience already has pre-existing emotional responses

178
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,371
that the game designer can build upon.

179
00:08:50,392 --> 00:08:50,952
For example,

180
00:08:51,612 --> 00:08:53,173
Magic didn't invent zombies.

181
00:08:55,474 --> 00:08:56,735
Players came to the game

182
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:59,376
with a pre-built emotional relationship with zombies,

183
00:08:59,897 --> 00:09:01,878
created from years of watching pop culture.

184
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:07,012
So Magic was able to build on that knowledge and make a rich emotional game experience.

185
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:16,260
Your audience has a deep deposit of emotional equity in pre-existing things, and as game

186
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:19,403
designers, that's a tool you should make use of and build upon.

187
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,702
So lesson number three, resonance is important.

188
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:26,365
The key to remember is your audience comes to your game

189
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:28,387
with a lot of stuff already there.

190
00:09:28,727 --> 00:09:31,269
As a game designer, use that, build upon it.

191
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:33,290
That it's, I'm gonna talk a lot today

192
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:34,912
about you're trying to create emotional responses

193
00:09:34,952 --> 00:09:35,532
with your audience.

194
00:09:35,812 --> 00:09:38,595
Well, they come with emotional responses built in.

195
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,976
You as game designers should take advantage of that.

196
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:43,318
Okay, up on the wall.

197
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:45,800
Lesson number four.

198
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,346
So for this one, we go to Theros from just a couple of years ago.

199
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:52,469
So Theros was our Greek mythology inspired set.

200
00:09:52,869 --> 00:09:56,812
It had us sort of following, you know, lots of cool ideas from Greek mythology.

201
00:09:57,593 --> 00:09:59,975
So one of the cards in the set was called Trojan Horse.

202
00:10:01,496 --> 00:10:04,099
And the idea of the card was, you would give it to your opponent,

203
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:07,942
and then every turn, a soldier would pop out of it.

204
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:09,423
Trojan Horse.

205
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:12,466
Now, there's no Troy in the game, because we had our own world.

206
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:14,549
Our version of Troy was called Akros.

207
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,432
So it was called a Cro-en horse, not Trojan horse.

208
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:21,095
And we playtested with it, and it was really popular.

209
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:22,237
Players really liked it.

210
00:10:22,957 --> 00:10:25,800
But then the creative team decided to make one small change.

211
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:30,245
Instead of being a horse, we've done horses, let's make it a lion.

212
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:31,686
Let's make it a Cro-en lion.

213
00:10:32,127 --> 00:10:36,130
So we changed the card, and then I started getting complaints in playtesting.

214
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,212
The people, they didn't like the card, they didn't understand the card,

215
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:41,854
they were really confused, like, what, what is this card doing?

216
00:10:42,754 --> 00:10:46,077
So we changed it back to a crone horse, and then everybody liked it again.

217
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:51,260
So lesson number four is to make use of piggybacking.

218
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,311
So, resonance has another valuable use.

219
00:10:54,811 --> 00:10:56,631
It's a teaching tool for game mechanics.

220
00:10:57,352 --> 00:10:59,132
So it makes use of something I call piggybacking.

221
00:10:59,372 --> 00:11:02,754
And what piggybacking is, is the use of pre-existing knowledge

222
00:11:02,994 --> 00:11:06,095
to front-load game information to make learning easier.

223
00:11:06,855 --> 00:11:10,096
So, for example, in Magic, we have a mechanic called flying.

224
00:11:10,676 --> 00:11:12,657
It is the easiest mechanic to teach,

225
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:16,058
because all I have to say is, you know, like, it flies.

226
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:20,835
you know, that it matches, that I don't have to teach a lot of the rules because it does,

227
00:11:21,256 --> 00:11:25,583
even though in a vacuum it has, there's rules with it, but it so matches expectation, it

228
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:28,267
so matches what people already know that it's easy to learn.

229
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:31,655
So now I'm going to give my one non-magic example today,

230
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:33,116
from Plants vs. Zombies,

231
00:11:33,456 --> 00:11:35,078
designed by a guy named George Fan,

232
00:11:35,098 --> 00:11:36,239
also is a magic player.

233
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:38,741
So he was trying to make a tower defense game.

234
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:41,663
So, the idea is that things are attacking

235
00:11:41,703 --> 00:11:44,045
and you have units you're putting to stop the attacks.

236
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:46,727
But one of the key things is once you place a unit,

237
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:47,668
you can't move it.

238
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:49,890
And George didn't like the fact that normally,

239
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,271
like, they'd be soldiers.

240
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:51,671
It's like, well...

241
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:56,034
If my soldier is right here and right next door, I desperately need the help,

242
00:11:56,274 --> 00:11:59,536
why won't the soldier just go right next door and help you? Why is that the case?

243
00:11:59,857 --> 00:12:03,679
So he's like, could I pick something? Could I pick something to be my units that

244
00:12:03,979 --> 00:12:11,304
the audience won't think they can move? And so he chose plants. Plant. It can't move.

245
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:16,548
It's in the name. It's planted. And so he chose it so that people would realize,

246
00:12:16,628 --> 00:12:20,390
oh, well, once I plant my plant, I have no expectation the plant's going to get up and

247
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:20,871
move anywhere.

248
00:12:22,014 --> 00:12:23,374
Also, he needed invading forces.

249
00:12:23,414 --> 00:12:24,935
He needed something that kept coming in waves.

250
00:12:25,255 --> 00:12:27,776
So he chose something that represented that,

251
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:30,238
that people would expect the zombies to slowly come

252
00:12:30,498 --> 00:12:31,378
and come in waves.

253
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:33,079
So a lot of people think,

254
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,980
oh, he just picked two funny things.

255
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,301
Oh, oh, they're plants.

256
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:37,481
Ha ha, they're zombies.

257
00:12:37,521 --> 00:12:39,362
But no, he carefully picked them

258
00:12:39,602 --> 00:12:41,964
because the choice reinforced the game,

259
00:12:42,184 --> 00:12:43,544
that by choosing those,

260
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:45,946
people understood the game easier and faster.

261
00:12:46,566 --> 00:12:48,727
So remember, you don't have to teach players

262
00:12:48,987 --> 00:12:50,048
things they already know.

263
00:12:51,198 --> 00:12:53,520
So lesson number four, make use of piggybacking.

264
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:57,724
That resonance not only will it emotionally attach your audience,

265
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:01,008
it also is a tool for teaching.

266
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:04,531
That you can use it to help people get your game quicker and faster.

267
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:07,194
That flavor, while it definitely has an emotional appeal,

268
00:13:07,414 --> 00:13:08,996
can help you with mechanics.

269
00:13:10,077 --> 00:13:10,858
So put it up on the wall.

270
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,296
Lesson number five.

271
00:13:13,817 --> 00:13:16,178
So for this one, we go back to Odyssey, back in September 2001.

272
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:20,720
So in Magic, there's an idea called card advantage.

273
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,541
It is a strategic thing that people learn as they get better at the game.

274
00:13:24,901 --> 00:13:27,682
So I'm doing a very abbreviated version of this

275
00:13:27,803 --> 00:13:29,623
for people who understand card advantage.

276
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:33,725
The idea is, if in my hand and in play, I have more cards than you have,

277
00:13:34,505 --> 00:13:37,128
Okay, then I have an advantage. If I have more cards than you,

278
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:38,990
strategically I'm at an advantage.

279
00:13:39,531 --> 00:13:41,012
So we were doing Odyssey and I said,

280
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:43,895
okay, what if I could turn card advantage on its head?

281
00:13:44,476 --> 00:13:46,558
So, for example, there was a card called Patrol Hound,

282
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:50,142
where you could discard a card from your hand to give it an ability.

283
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:52,264
But it didn't matter. You didn't even care what it got.

284
00:13:52,284 --> 00:13:53,265
You didn't even want the ability.

285
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,328
You just wanted to discard cards from your hand.

286
00:13:55,808 --> 00:13:56,869
Well, why would you want to do that?

287
00:13:57,309 --> 00:13:59,370
So there was a mechanic in the set called Threshold.

288
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:01,031
And what Threshold said is,

289
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:03,053
when you got seven cards in your graveyard,

290
00:14:03,733 --> 00:14:04,634
things would change.

291
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:07,036
So for example, the Crostan Beast, which is a 1-1,

292
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:08,276
became an 8-8.

293
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:11,479
So the idea was, if you had seven cards in your hand,

294
00:14:11,979 --> 00:14:14,601
you could discard them all to the Patrol Hound

295
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:17,583
to give your Crostan Beast and make it a 1-1 into an 8-8.

296
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:20,285
How did that go over with the audience?

297
00:14:25,472 --> 00:14:29,774
The problem was, yes, you could make them do that,

298
00:14:29,914 --> 00:14:31,235
but they didn't want to do that.

299
00:14:31,615 --> 00:14:33,476
You know, instead of throwing away their entire hand,

300
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:36,438
they'd rather, I don't know, play the cards in their hand.

301
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,299
So it leads to lesson number five.

302
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:41,220
Don't confuse interesting with fun.

303
00:14:42,561 --> 00:14:44,422
So there's two different types of stimulation.

304
00:14:44,822 --> 00:14:49,464
There's intellectual stimulation, so, hmm, interesting.

305
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:53,746
And there's emotional stimulation, ha ha, fun.

306
00:14:54,747 --> 00:14:55,768
Those are different things.

307
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,130
So for example, in magic, looking at the cards

308
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,911
is intellectual stimulation.

309
00:15:01,271 --> 00:15:03,692
Oh, let me see what they do, and that's interesting,

310
00:15:03,732 --> 00:15:05,513
and how they design the set.

311
00:15:06,254 --> 00:15:07,494
And there's playing with the cards,

312
00:15:07,534 --> 00:15:09,555
but that's more about emotional, like,

313
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:11,417
oh, is it fun, am I having fun playing this?

314
00:15:11,957 --> 00:15:14,798
So we tend to think of ourselves as intellectual creatures,

315
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,300
but we tend to make most of our decisions

316
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,161
based less on facts and more on emotion.

317
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,484
So your game can speak to your audience on an intellectual level,

318
00:15:25,426 --> 00:15:28,371
or it can speak to them on an emotional level.

319
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:30,374
Now both are valuable,

320
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:33,219
but when you speak to the players on an emotional level,

321
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:35,783
you're more likely to create player satisfaction.

322
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:39,557
So lesson number five, don't confuse interesting with fun.

323
00:15:39,577 --> 00:15:41,839
Look, when we talk about why we make games

324
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,500
and what we want the audience to get out of the game,

325
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,061
it's an emotional response.

326
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:46,342
You know, we talk about fun,

327
00:15:46,382 --> 00:15:47,983
and maybe you're trying to create other emotions

328
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:49,764
or games that do things other than produce fun,

329
00:15:50,064 --> 00:15:51,945
but you want to get some emotional response

330
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:52,666
out of your audience.

331
00:15:52,806 --> 00:15:55,708
So there's a difference between being interesting

332
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:56,688
and being fun.

333
00:15:57,028 --> 00:15:59,290
And make sure that you're not confusing the two,

334
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,252
because being fun more gets the result that you want.

335
00:16:03,813 --> 00:16:04,573
So put it up on the board.

336
00:16:06,222 --> 00:16:11,624
Lesson number six, back to Innistrad, our gothic horror set, remember with the vampires,

337
00:16:11,664 --> 00:16:12,585
werewolves and zombies.

338
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:16,726
So I was the lead designer of this set and I was trying to figure out what exactly we

339
00:16:16,766 --> 00:16:17,687
wanted the set to do.

340
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:22,488
So what I did is I thought back to the pop culture that inspired this, you know, where

341
00:16:22,729 --> 00:16:26,690
the audience would get their resources from, where would they think about the horror genre,

342
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,651
and that's movies and TVs and books.

343
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:35,263
And what I realized was, if I sort of followed the guideline of the source material, I knew

344
00:16:35,303 --> 00:16:36,584
what I wanted out of my audience.

345
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:40,208
Fear.

346
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,175
That when you look at the horror genre, that it's about scaring the audience, it's about

347
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:48,758
creating a sense of terror, a suspense, of dread.

348
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:52,548
So when I built the set, I actually built mechanics with that in mind.

349
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:56,090
So for example, normally in Magic, we only have one face,

350
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,372
but we did a double-faced card, cards that had stuff on both sides.

351
00:16:59,693 --> 00:17:03,155
So one side could be a human, and the other side is a scary werewolf.

352
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:06,978
Or it could be Dr. Jekyll, on the back it was Mr. Hyde.

353
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,500
Or it could be a scientist messing with things he shouldn't be messing with,

354
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:12,322
and on the back it's the fly.

355
00:17:13,463 --> 00:17:15,404
We also had a mechanic called Morbid that...

356
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,986
Things happened when creatures died, so all of a sudden, death became kind of scary,

357
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,746
because you never quite knew what was going to happen.

358
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:27,208
And we had a mechanic called flashback, which would have spells happen again.

359
00:17:27,428 --> 00:17:29,828
That once things are in the graveyard, they could happen again.

360
00:17:30,128 --> 00:17:34,569
So you can make 13 zombies, and then flash it back, and make 13 more.

361
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:40,671
So lesson number six is, understand what emotion your game is trying to evoke.

362
00:17:41,776 --> 00:17:46,278
To be successful with your game, you need to know what your audience is trying to experience.

363
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:48,819
What emotional response are you trying to create?

364
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,542
In order to know what to put into your game, you have to understand what comes out.

365
00:17:54,922 --> 00:17:59,445
So you must continually ask yourself, what impact will this game choice have on the player

366
00:17:59,485 --> 00:18:00,045
experience?

367
00:18:00,765 --> 00:18:04,527
And if it doesn't contribute to the overall experience, it has to go.

368
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:07,668
So back to college, I took a lot of classes in college.

369
00:18:08,308 --> 00:18:09,789
This time I took a screenwriting course,

370
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:12,511
and the teacher taught me something that really stuck with me.

371
00:18:12,952 --> 00:18:15,434
So it talks about no scene is worth a movie,

372
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,436
no line is worth a scene.

373
00:18:18,136 --> 00:18:20,978
So what that means is, no matter how good a scene is,

374
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:23,681
if it's not serving the larger movie,

375
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:25,042
it has to be cut.

376
00:18:26,303 --> 00:18:27,784
And the same holds true for a line.

377
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,307
If the line doesn't serve the scene,

378
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,450
you need to cut it.

379
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:38,901
that the idea behind this whole thought was,

380
00:18:39,141 --> 00:18:40,682
it doesn't matter how good your line is,

381
00:18:40,922 --> 00:18:42,803
if it doesn't enhance the scene, get rid of it.

382
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:44,404
It doesn't matter how good your scene is,

383
00:18:44,645 --> 00:18:46,586
if it doesn't advance the movie, get rid of it.

384
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,108
So the same applies to game design,

385
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,629
because everything in the game

386
00:18:50,969 --> 00:18:52,770
has to contribute to the emotional output

387
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:54,011
you're trying to create.

388
00:18:54,632 --> 00:18:57,013
If not, it has to go.

389
00:18:58,094 --> 00:18:59,075
So lesson number six,

390
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:01,337
understand what emotion your game is trying to evoke.

391
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,841
Like, once again, the theme of today is,

392
00:19:04,622 --> 00:19:05,902
humans are emotional creatures.

393
00:19:06,123 --> 00:19:07,603
You are trying to get a response out of them.

394
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,384
Think about what emotion you're trying to get,

395
00:19:09,404 --> 00:19:11,905
and then make sure your game is moving in that direction,

396
00:19:11,946 --> 00:19:14,707
that all your components are trying to get the emotional response

397
00:19:14,747 --> 00:19:15,908
you're trying to get from your audience.

398
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:18,769
Up on the wall.

399
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,110
Lesson number seven.

400
00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:24,670
So this one happened on a plane ride to Gen Con,

401
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,210
so that's a big gaming convention.

402
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,191
I was seated next to Christopher Rush,

403
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:32,311
who sadly just passed away a few weeks ago.

404
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:35,092
He is a magic illustrator, probably best known

405
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:36,812
for illustrating Black Lotus,

406
00:19:36,852 --> 00:19:38,373
one of the most iconic magic cards.

407
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:40,633
Also, not a lot of people realize this,

408
00:19:40,673 --> 00:19:42,134
but he also did all the mana symbols.

409
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,654
So his work sticks with us today.

410
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:47,155
So he and I were talking about land.

411
00:19:47,615 --> 00:19:50,516
So in the game of Magic, land's the basic resource.

412
00:19:50,796 --> 00:19:51,456
It's a pretty...

413
00:19:52,256 --> 00:19:55,497
boring part of the game in the big picture. It's not where the excitement lies.

414
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:59,759
And Chris came up with a neat idea. He said, what if we took the land, which

415
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,841
looked like this at the time, and we made the art real big? And we did something

416
00:20:03,861 --> 00:20:07,883
exciting where the art was most of the card. And the rest of the people there

417
00:20:07,963 --> 00:20:13,285
said, Chris, no. That's not what the land looks like, and who cares? We don't

418
00:20:13,305 --> 00:20:16,166
need it. The land's not the exciting part of the game. We don't need to worry about

419
00:20:16,186 --> 00:20:16,546
the land.

420
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:22,632
So a year later, I made a set called Unglued, which was a very different kind of set.

421
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:25,714
And so, I put full art land in.

422
00:20:26,115 --> 00:20:27,936
I said I thought it was a neat idea.

423
00:20:27,956 --> 00:20:30,337
And, beloved. Players really liked it.

424
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:33,580
So a number of years later, I did it again. I made the art bigger.

425
00:20:35,615 --> 00:20:37,396
Eventually, we started putting it in normal sets.

426
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,537
Zendikar had full art land, very popular.

427
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,398
Battle for Zendikar had them, very popular.

428
00:20:42,418 --> 00:20:46,600
And what we found was, players really did attach to the land, it mattered to them.

429
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,621
And it wasn't just a matter of full art,

430
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,602
that we started working up, trying really hard

431
00:20:51,862 --> 00:20:55,224
to make sure that all our lands had a very unique look to them.

432
00:20:55,684 --> 00:20:58,006
so that we gave the player choices,

433
00:20:58,226 --> 00:20:59,746
that when you play an island, for example,

434
00:20:59,766 --> 00:21:01,507
obviously there's five basic lands, I'm showing island,

435
00:21:01,748 --> 00:21:02,828
that you had a lot of choices.

436
00:21:03,268 --> 00:21:04,969
We even experimented. There's some cards we made.

437
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:08,371
These are real, actual Earth places that were on cards.

438
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:11,273
And here's one, for example, the Guru Island

439
00:21:11,593 --> 00:21:14,054
that was made by Therese Nielsen, very pretty, it's very rare.

440
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:15,895
It's one of the most valued cards in the game

441
00:21:16,136 --> 00:21:17,977
because players do care.

442
00:21:18,337 --> 00:21:21,759
It's not just an island, it's not just a basic land,

443
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,039
that players care about that.

444
00:21:23,695 --> 00:21:25,496
So that leads us into lesson number seven.

445
00:21:26,477 --> 00:21:29,358
Allow the player the ability to make the game personal.

446
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:31,039
Okay, back to college.

447
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,661
This time, an advertising class.

448
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:35,362
So I learned something really interesting.

449
00:21:35,402 --> 00:21:37,984
So, if you're in a store staring at a shelf,

450
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:40,545
and you've never purchased a product before,

451
00:21:41,606 --> 00:21:43,107
what are you most likely to purchase?

452
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:48,530
The brand you're most familiar with.

453
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:51,252
Why? Why is that?

454
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:53,708
Because it's a little quirk in the brain.

455
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:58,212
So, it associates your knowledge of something with quality.

456
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:01,795
Because if you know it, well then it must mean it's better.

457
00:22:02,576 --> 00:22:05,338
That knowledge equals quality.

458
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,541
Okay, for the psychologists out there, technically knowledge equals familiarity,

459
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:12,203
which equals preference, which equals quality, but I'm short-cutting here.

460
00:22:12,726 --> 00:22:13,947
by the transfer property works.

461
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:18,191
So the idea essentially is your brain just,

462
00:22:18,572 --> 00:22:20,113
it prioritizes things you know,

463
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,495
that things in your brain, it just thinks that they're better

464
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:23,576
because you know them.

465
00:22:24,317 --> 00:22:26,139
So what this means in game design,

466
00:22:26,439 --> 00:22:28,000
it's important for your players

467
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,962
to have a personal connection with your game.

468
00:22:30,743 --> 00:22:32,524
The more the players feel the game is about them,

469
00:22:33,005 --> 00:22:34,666
the better their brain will think of it.

470
00:22:37,209 --> 00:22:38,070
So how do you do that?

471
00:22:39,261 --> 00:22:41,663
Okay, provide a lot of choices.

472
00:22:42,363 --> 00:22:46,687
Give them different resources, different paths, different expressions.

473
00:22:47,447 --> 00:22:51,610
Give the player the ability to choose, and importantly, not to choose things.

474
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:54,913
Allowing them to feel that what they choose is theirs.

475
00:22:56,913 --> 00:23:01,276
So for example, in Magic, one of the things I think that really helps Magic is we give you so much choice.

476
00:23:01,857 --> 00:23:02,877
You can choose your colors.

477
00:23:03,398 --> 00:23:04,538
You can choose your creatures.

478
00:23:04,939 --> 00:23:06,140
You can choose your characters.

479
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,721
You can choose your factions.

480
00:23:08,101 --> 00:23:09,602
You can choose your illustrations.

481
00:23:10,102 --> 00:23:13,825
And of course, you can choose your frames, that there's so many options available to you.

482
00:23:14,645 --> 00:23:18,728
So lesson number seven is, allow the player the ability to make the game personal.

483
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:25,054
So just remember, the players will think more highly of things that they can find a personal

484
00:23:25,094 --> 00:23:25,754
connection to.

485
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:30,198
In order for you to do that, make sure you give them the choices to be able to find the

486
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:32,099
things to be, to make personal.

487
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:36,122
Lesson number eight.

488
00:23:36,802 --> 00:23:38,364
So this is from Gatecrash a couple years ago.

489
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,486
So in it, we had a card called Totally Lost.

490
00:23:42,392 --> 00:23:46,573
So this was not a particularly strong card, it never got played in constructed tournaments.

491
00:23:46,953 --> 00:23:48,394
People would play in limited, it's not bad in limited.

492
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:51,935
Limited is when you open the cards and you play with the cards that you open.

493
00:23:52,716 --> 00:23:54,557
So anyway, we needed something simple.

494
00:23:54,597 --> 00:23:56,277
The card makes a creature go away for a while.

495
00:23:56,597 --> 00:24:00,379
And so the artist said, okay, well let's just show a creature getting lost in the city of Ravnica,

496
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:01,319
which is where it took place.

497
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,222
And so this little guy, his name is Fibblethip.

498
00:24:08,342 --> 00:24:11,283
And he's a little homunculus, a creature made of magic.

499
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:13,768
The audience really took the fibble-fib.

500
00:24:15,188 --> 00:24:17,209
They started putting them in different magic settings.

501
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:25,152
And non-magic settings.

502
00:24:30,553 --> 00:24:31,194
Did everybody find them?

503
00:24:31,214 --> 00:24:31,814
It's right there.

504
00:24:35,415 --> 00:24:36,295
OK, I'll help you a little bit.

505
00:24:39,136 --> 00:24:39,496
Right there.

506
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:41,837
There's Waldo.

507
00:24:44,381 --> 00:24:45,862
They started doing memes with him.

508
00:24:52,348 --> 00:24:54,030
They started making greeting cards.

509
00:24:56,852 --> 00:24:58,213
They put him in comic strips.

510
00:25:01,957 --> 00:25:03,639
They started making illustrations with him.

511
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,641
They made figures out of him.

512
00:25:10,692 --> 00:25:14,234
It's just, they really, really took to him and did all sorts of crazy things.

513
00:25:14,314 --> 00:25:15,855
And then, we got in on the game.

514
00:25:16,296 --> 00:25:19,678
We started making cell phones and keychains.

515
00:25:20,498 --> 00:25:21,459
We even made a little plush.

516
00:25:21,499 --> 00:25:22,079
He's really cute.

517
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,102
And the players just really, really took to him.

518
00:25:27,123 --> 00:25:30,285
So much so, that we started putting him back in the game.

519
00:25:31,265 --> 00:25:32,186
You guys catch this one?

520
00:25:35,108 --> 00:25:36,068
So lesson number eight.

521
00:25:37,182 --> 00:25:40,703
The details are where your player falls in love with your game.

522
00:25:42,003 --> 00:25:44,684
So as the player explores their choices,

523
00:25:45,204 --> 00:25:46,965
they are searching for things to bond with.

524
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:50,246
The players want to find a piece of the game to call their own.

525
00:25:51,087 --> 00:25:54,028
Now in Magic, players bond over cards or characters.

526
00:25:54,668 --> 00:25:56,549
Sometimes even over a single image.

527
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,149
This is bear punching, very popular last year.

528
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,870
This means the details matter

529
00:26:02,611 --> 00:26:06,552
because the individual will bond with the game through the details.

530
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,802
What might seem insignificant is anything but.

531
00:26:10,782 --> 00:26:13,805
That small detail may only matter to a tiny percentage.

532
00:26:14,805 --> 00:26:16,767
But to that percentage, it can mean everything.

533
00:26:17,247 --> 00:26:20,970
Because that might be the thing that makes the player fall in love with your game.

534
00:26:21,991 --> 00:26:25,794
So lesson number eight, the details are where the players fall in love with your game.

535
00:26:26,174 --> 00:26:30,558
I cannot stress this enough, that it's very important that people want to...

536
00:26:31,644 --> 00:26:33,045
People are individuals.

537
00:26:33,085 --> 00:26:34,946
They want to sort of come to the game

538
00:26:35,186 --> 00:26:37,208
and find something that they can claim to be their own.

539
00:26:37,668 --> 00:26:39,349
And that's going to happen in the details.

540
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:41,371
So when people always say the details don't matter,

541
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,411
that's not true at all.

542
00:26:42,431 --> 00:26:43,872
The details matter very, very much.

543
00:26:44,493 --> 00:26:46,614
It's not that everybody will care about every detail,

544
00:26:46,835 --> 00:26:48,876
but somebody will care about each piece of detail.

545
00:26:49,557 --> 00:26:51,598
And it's crucial that it's those details,

546
00:26:51,658 --> 00:26:52,799
it's those little tiny things,

547
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:54,160
the little fibbletips of the world

548
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,161
that really endear the audience to your game.

549
00:26:57,562 --> 00:26:58,223
So up on the wall.

550
00:26:59,824 --> 00:27:00,585
Lesson number nine.

551
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,412
Okay, there are many different ways to play Magic.

552
00:27:03,992 --> 00:27:05,313
We refer to them as formats.

553
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:08,095
So some formats we create.

554
00:27:08,455 --> 00:27:10,637
Standard uses the last 18 months worth of cards.

555
00:27:11,037 --> 00:27:13,079
Modern uses about the last 10 years worth of cards.

556
00:27:13,579 --> 00:27:15,220
A booster draft, you rip and open the cards

557
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,201
and you draft them right out of the booster pack.

558
00:27:18,342 --> 00:27:20,144
So other formats are made by our players.

559
00:27:20,724 --> 00:27:22,425
Pauper uses just common cards.

560
00:27:22,966 --> 00:27:24,407
Emperor is a three-on-three match.

561
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:28,550
But the current most popular player-made format is Commander.

562
00:27:30,169 --> 00:27:33,913
So, Commander goes back, there were a bunch of judges way back when, who all day long would judge.

563
00:27:34,233 --> 00:27:36,756
And when they were done judging, they wanted to play Magic.

564
00:27:37,176 --> 00:27:38,978
But they decided to make their own format.

565
00:27:39,499 --> 00:27:44,023
And so they were inspired by these five elder dragons from a set called Legends long ago.

566
00:27:44,544 --> 00:27:46,305
And so they made a format. Here's how the format works.

567
00:27:46,846 --> 00:27:49,689
You choose a legendary creature. You can see that on the card.

568
00:27:49,989 --> 00:27:52,652
These represent individual characters. These are specific people.

569
00:27:53,652 --> 00:27:55,433
And then they act as the commander for your deck.

570
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:59,335
And you add 99 other cards that match the color of your commander.

571
00:27:59,355 --> 00:28:00,735
So if your commander's like green and white,

572
00:28:00,955 --> 00:28:02,796
your cards have to be green, white, or green and white.

573
00:28:03,676 --> 00:28:04,296
No repeats.

574
00:28:04,637 --> 00:28:07,658
So 100 cards, one's your commander, 99 are other cards.

575
00:28:07,898 --> 00:28:08,878
They all have to match the color.

576
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:11,959
And commander was such a popular format

577
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,141
that we, back in 2011, made a commander product.

578
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:16,961
That we put this out.

579
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:18,822
Now it was planned as a one-time thing,

580
00:28:19,402 --> 00:28:21,983
but it was so popular, we did something the next year.

581
00:28:22,724 --> 00:28:23,465
and the next year.

582
00:28:24,365 --> 00:28:26,687
And now, it's just something we do every year.

583
00:28:27,487 --> 00:28:29,028
And the players have fallen in love with it.

584
00:28:30,369 --> 00:28:32,351
And it's something that we didn't even generate.

585
00:28:32,391 --> 00:28:33,631
I mean, we obviously made the product,

586
00:28:33,652 --> 00:28:35,913
but the players generated this and created it,

587
00:28:36,093 --> 00:28:38,175
and it's become something that's an enduring part of the game.

588
00:28:38,975 --> 00:28:40,076
So lesson number nine,

589
00:28:41,076 --> 00:28:43,298
allow your players to have a sense of ownership.

590
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:45,980
Okay, so once the players made choices

591
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,641
and bonded over details,

592
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:50,303
next, you need to add customization.

593
00:28:51,213 --> 00:28:55,155
you need to give them the ability to build things that are uniquely their own.

594
00:28:56,116 --> 00:28:58,977
Now, in Magic, this customization can happen through a format,

595
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,519
but it's most often in Magic done through deck building.

596
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,980
Players can choose any 60 cards,

597
00:29:05,781 --> 00:29:07,622
or any 100 cards if they're playing Commander,

598
00:29:07,642 --> 00:29:10,323
or other formats require other amounts of cards,

599
00:29:10,924 --> 00:29:12,985
from over 15,000 cards.

600
00:29:13,625 --> 00:29:15,866
So, by the way, when I said 14,000 earlier, that's on my watch.

601
00:29:15,906 --> 00:29:17,707
There's 1,000 that got made before I got there.

602
00:29:18,628 --> 00:29:22,829
And then for each card, they get to pick which exact version they want.

603
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:25,690
You know, there's different frames, there's different art, there's lots of choices.

604
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:28,551
And the result is, they don't just create a deck.

605
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:30,631
They create their deck.

606
00:29:31,231 --> 00:29:33,012
Something that personally represents them.

607
00:29:33,812 --> 00:29:36,233
So when their deck wins, they win.

608
00:29:36,853 --> 00:29:39,093
Because the deck is no longer just a part of the game.

609
00:29:39,834 --> 00:29:41,334
It's an extension of themselves.

610
00:29:42,355 --> 00:29:45,718
So lesson number nine, allow your players to have a sense of ownership.

611
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:50,062
This is very important, that if you want your players to bond as closely as you can,

612
00:29:50,362 --> 00:29:53,465
the game has to move beyond being yours and become theirs.

613
00:29:53,745 --> 00:29:56,528
You have to find a way to make sure that the player can do that.

614
00:29:56,728 --> 00:30:00,191
And the key is customization, because you want your player to be able to do something

615
00:30:00,391 --> 00:30:03,234
that nobody else could do, that they did, that's their creation.

616
00:30:03,254 --> 00:30:05,316
So up on the board.

617
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:07,698
Okay, lesson number ten.

618
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:10,594
So we made a card a while back called Summoner's Pact.

619
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:11,935
So here's what Summoner's Pact does.

620
00:30:12,575 --> 00:30:14,857
It lets you go into your library, which is your deck,

621
00:30:15,297 --> 00:30:17,639
and get a green creature out of it and put it in play.

622
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:20,420
The trick is it doesn't cost anything.

623
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:23,762
Well, next turn you have to pay for it.

624
00:30:23,802 --> 00:30:24,603
You're putting on credit.

625
00:30:25,363 --> 00:30:28,165
So you don't have to pay for it now, you have to pay for it next turn.

626
00:30:28,586 --> 00:30:29,926
Now if you don't, you lose the game,

627
00:30:30,026 --> 00:30:32,608
but probably you won't cast this if you can't do that.

628
00:30:32,648 --> 00:30:33,669
So that's okay.

629
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:38,011
So this card lets you get a free green creature out of your deck.

630
00:30:39,207 --> 00:30:40,788
I mean, free for the turn, but good enough.

631
00:30:40,968 --> 00:30:41,569
Maybe you'll win this turn.

632
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,751
Okay, now we have a card called Hivemine we made.

633
00:30:45,091 --> 00:30:50,094
So what Hivemine does is it says whenever a certain kind of spell is played, you can

634
00:30:50,134 --> 00:30:50,574
copy it.

635
00:30:51,094 --> 00:30:53,856
So the idea is, let's say someone casts Divination, this lets you draw cards.

636
00:30:54,617 --> 00:30:57,038
Everybody gets a Divination, everybody gets to draw cards.

637
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:01,801
Okay, so what happens when Hivemine meets Summoner's Pact?

638
00:31:02,641 --> 00:31:04,923
Hey, everybody gets a Summoner's Pact.

639
00:31:05,423 --> 00:31:06,344
But here's the problem.

640
00:31:06,944 --> 00:31:08,845
Everybody gets to get a green creature out of their deck.

641
00:31:09,592 --> 00:31:11,892
A lot of them don't even have a green creature in their deck,

642
00:31:12,393 --> 00:31:14,093
and this is on payment.

643
00:31:14,113 --> 00:31:16,754
They got to pay this next turn, or they lose the game.

644
00:31:17,674 --> 00:31:18,595
So you see where this is going.

645
00:31:19,115 --> 00:31:21,896
So we started with a card that gets a green creature out

646
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:25,817
of your deck, and another card that copies certain spells.

647
00:31:26,237 --> 00:31:29,138
But when you add them together, you win the game.

648
00:31:29,938 --> 00:31:32,179
Now, that's not something we built into that.

649
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:33,800
When we made each of these cards,

650
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,240
that was nothing we had in mind.

651
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,681
This is something that the players came up with.

652
00:31:38,141 --> 00:31:39,021
So this is lesson number 10.

653
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,542
leave room for your players to explore.

654
00:31:42,562 --> 00:31:45,384
OK, so I said you want to give them choices,

655
00:31:46,024 --> 00:31:47,205
you need to give them details,

656
00:31:47,765 --> 00:31:49,006
you need to give them customization.

657
00:31:49,567 --> 00:31:51,108
OK, so let's talk about how they're presented.

658
00:31:52,349 --> 00:31:55,051
OK, before I was a game designer,

659
00:31:56,052 --> 00:31:56,872
I worked in Hollywood.

660
00:31:58,053 --> 00:31:59,094
I was a TV writer, if you didn't know.

661
00:32:01,035 --> 00:32:02,516
In TV, there's something called the pitch.

662
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,502
So the idea of a pitch is you stand up in front of the room

663
00:32:05,862 --> 00:32:07,864
and you have to sell people on your story.

664
00:32:08,464 --> 00:32:09,445
And this is very crucial.

665
00:32:09,485 --> 00:32:12,007
The difference between being a good writer and a bad writer

666
00:32:12,207 --> 00:32:13,068
is your ability to pitch.

667
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:14,889
So I took a lot of classes in it.

668
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:19,073
So the number one rule is don't talk at your audience.

669
00:32:19,513 --> 00:32:20,654
You want to talk with them.

670
00:32:21,255 --> 00:32:22,576
So here's one of the tricks they taught you.

671
00:32:22,896 --> 00:32:24,718
So when you're doing your pitch, you

672
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:26,900
want to get your audience to ask questions.

673
00:32:32,822 --> 00:32:33,943
Why is that so important?

674
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:38,567
Because people are more invested in things that they initiated.

675
00:32:39,268 --> 00:32:41,470
That if you just talk, they might drone you out.

676
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,531
But if you get them to ask you a question,

677
00:32:43,551 --> 00:32:45,613
then they tune in because you're asking,

678
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,435
you're answering their question.

679
00:32:48,616 --> 00:32:50,457
So this is very important when it comes to game design.

680
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:53,400
Don't always show the players the things you want them to see.

681
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,321
Let your players find them.

682
00:32:56,252 --> 00:33:00,556
Give them the choice to design a customization, but let it be things they discover.

683
00:33:01,196 --> 00:33:04,379
Because if they find it, they'll be more invested.

684
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:08,422
So lesson number 10, leave room for the player to explore.

685
00:33:08,982 --> 00:33:10,183
This is very, very important.

686
00:33:10,444 --> 00:33:14,006
The idea of investment is a key part of what makes people bond.

687
00:33:14,227 --> 00:33:16,969
And so you want to make sure that you're not always giving it to them.

688
00:33:17,189 --> 00:33:20,972
Just like when I was doing my pitch, I didn't want to just give them the story, I wanted

689
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,753
to get them to ask me the story.

690
00:33:22,933 --> 00:33:25,235
Because then they were invested in me telling it.

691
00:33:26,526 --> 00:33:27,086
up on the wall.

692
00:33:27,947 --> 00:33:28,868
Okay, lesson number 11.

693
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:31,630
So in R&D, we do something called a rare poll.

694
00:33:32,171 --> 00:33:34,773
So we want to understand what impact our rares

695
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:36,575
and mythic rares are going to have on our audience.

696
00:33:37,175 --> 00:33:38,316
So what do we do?

697
00:33:38,597 --> 00:33:40,999
We ask magic players who work at Wizards,

698
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:43,961
but not in R&D, to take a poll and give us their feedback.

699
00:33:44,642 --> 00:33:46,984
So each card's graded on a scale from 1 to 10.

700
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:49,426
1 means something you would be,

701
00:33:50,467 --> 00:33:52,188
you don't want to play with.

702
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:53,650
10, you'd be very excited to open it up.

703
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:59,498
Okay, then we collect all the data, and we use it to figure out which cards we should keep, and which cards we should change.

704
00:34:00,699 --> 00:34:01,780
Okay, so which is better?

705
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,602
A card that receives all sevens,

706
00:34:05,662 --> 00:34:08,705
or a card with half ones and twos, and half nines and tens?

707
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,046
I'll give you a second. Which one do you think is better?

708
00:34:13,268 --> 00:34:16,170
The second. A card with half ones and twos, and half nines and tens.

709
00:34:16,671 --> 00:34:17,011
Why?

710
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:22,095
Because we prefer cards that evoke a strong response, even if some of that response is negative.

711
00:34:23,068 --> 00:34:24,529
So it brings us to lesson number 11.

712
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:28,891
If everyone likes your game, but no one loves it, it will fail.

713
00:34:30,052 --> 00:34:31,773
So my metaphor here is a blind date.

714
00:34:32,913 --> 00:34:35,135
So when you go on a blind date, you have a list of things you want,

715
00:34:35,475 --> 00:34:36,415
the things you're looking for,

716
00:34:36,435 --> 00:34:40,097
and at the end of the blind date, if everything is checked off on your list,

717
00:34:40,718 --> 00:34:42,119
but there is no joy in the date,

718
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:43,579
there is no excitement,

719
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,060
there is no passion,

720
00:34:45,881 --> 00:34:47,702
it doesn't matter that you checked off your list.

721
00:34:48,302 --> 00:34:49,363
There won't be a second date.

722
00:34:50,223 --> 00:34:53,225
You know, the blind date isn't about not having negative things,

723
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:54,906
it's about having something positive.

724
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,407
So players don't need to love everything,

725
00:34:57,827 --> 00:34:59,228
but they need to love something.

726
00:35:00,509 --> 00:35:02,210
Something has to draw them into your game.

727
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,211
Something they feel strongly about.

728
00:35:05,192 --> 00:35:07,253
Now don't worry that players will hate something.

729
00:35:07,834 --> 00:35:09,394
Worry that no one will love anything.

730
00:35:10,237 --> 00:35:15,598
Because things that evoke strong responses will most often evoke strong responses in many directions.

731
00:35:16,178 --> 00:35:21,040
Meaning that it's almost impossible to make players love something without making other players hate it.

732
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,861
In fact, some players enjoy hating what other players love.

733
00:35:26,122 --> 00:35:27,262
So it's almost impossible.

734
00:35:28,202 --> 00:35:30,763
So stop worrying about evoking a negative response,

735
00:35:31,283 --> 00:35:33,624
and start worrying about evoking a strong response.

736
00:35:34,464 --> 00:35:38,105
So lesson number 11, if everyone likes your game but no one loves it, it will fail.

737
00:35:38,822 --> 00:35:39,802
And I can't stress this enough.

738
00:35:40,102 --> 00:35:42,623
People too often want to minimize the negative.

739
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:46,004
They're so worried about not having anybody dislike something

740
00:35:46,204 --> 00:35:47,845
that they miss the big picture, which is,

741
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:49,265
that's not the important part.

742
00:35:49,626 --> 00:35:51,986
You have to make sure you evoke the positive response.

743
00:35:52,206 --> 00:35:53,447
People have to fall in love.

744
00:35:53,687 --> 00:35:55,007
There's a lot of attention out there.

745
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,208
There's a lot of games to play.

746
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:58,609
If your game doesn't make someone fall in love with it,

747
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:00,670
guess what, they're going to go to a game that does.

748
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,030
Up on the board.

749
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:03,991
Lesson number 12.

750
00:36:05,286 --> 00:36:07,187
Okay, so in the game, we have planeswalkers.

751
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:09,949
These are characters that cast magic, that duel with magic.

752
00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:12,350
You, the player, you're a planeswalker.

753
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,952
And we spend a lot of time and energy on these planeswalkers.

754
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,353
They're our major characters in the story.

755
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:18,054
In fact, we make cards out of them.

756
00:36:18,314 --> 00:36:20,175
And the planeswalker cards are very popular.

757
00:36:20,475 --> 00:36:22,296
In fact, they're some of the most popular cards we make.

758
00:36:22,696 --> 00:36:25,478
Whenever we have a new set, people always ask about the new cards.

759
00:36:26,419 --> 00:36:28,900
So this story goes back to Avacyn Restored in May of 2012.

760
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,381
We made a card called Tybalt.

761
00:36:32,461 --> 00:36:36,744
So he was a devil planeswalker, they used like pain magic and a sharp dresser.

762
00:36:37,705 --> 00:36:39,847
But we decided that he was only going to cost two mana.

763
00:36:40,447 --> 00:36:45,471
Because we had cards, we had four mana, three mana, six mana, five mana, we'd done all that.

764
00:36:45,692 --> 00:36:47,433
We'd never done a two-mana planeswalker.

765
00:36:47,953 --> 00:36:51,776
Now, nothing about this being two mana served the card or the character.

766
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:53,538
We just wanted to see if we could do it.

767
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:55,059
So what happened?

768
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,731
One of the reasons people love planeswalkers is they're powerful, they're good.

769
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:06,031
We tend to make our planeswalkers good.

770
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:09,733
But by making it two-mana, we didn't allow ourselves the ability to do that.

771
00:37:10,033 --> 00:37:13,014
And the reason they didn't like him was he just was weak because he cost two-mana.

772
00:37:13,654 --> 00:37:14,714
So let's bring this to lesson number 12.

773
00:37:15,915 --> 00:37:17,915
Don't design to prove you can do something.

774
00:37:18,876 --> 00:37:19,876
So I'm going to let you in on a secret.

775
00:37:20,576 --> 00:37:24,038
People who create tend to have large egos.

776
00:37:25,258 --> 00:37:27,939
Because it takes ego to will something into existence.

777
00:37:28,638 --> 00:37:29,939
Now, having an ego is fine.

778
00:37:30,319 --> 00:37:31,620
I personally have a very large ego.

779
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:34,763
But you can't let your ego drive your motivation.

780
00:37:35,704 --> 00:37:38,226
Remember, your goal is to deliver an optimal experience

781
00:37:38,266 --> 00:37:39,327
for your target audience.

782
00:37:39,948 --> 00:37:42,670
Your decisions have to serve your game and not you.

783
00:37:43,351 --> 00:37:44,231
So ask yourself,

784
00:37:45,092 --> 00:37:47,394
is this decision helping me achieve the optimal experience

785
00:37:47,414 --> 00:37:48,355
for my target audience?

786
00:37:49,276 --> 00:37:51,378
Or is it being done to fulfill an inwardly facing need

787
00:37:51,398 --> 00:37:52,479
for self-satisfaction?

788
00:37:52,499 --> 00:37:54,320
Because if the answer is the latter,

789
00:37:55,301 --> 00:37:56,522
you're doing it for the wrong reason.

790
00:37:57,629 --> 00:38:00,151
So number 12, don't design to prove you can do something.

791
00:38:00,852 --> 00:38:03,214
And one of the things, I think people fall in this trap.

792
00:38:03,454 --> 00:38:06,877
We are game designers and most of us, or all of us pretty much, are game players.

793
00:38:07,317 --> 00:38:10,640
And it's really easy to fall in the trap to think of game design as a game

794
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,341
that you're trying to have fun playing.

795
00:38:12,882 --> 00:38:16,304
But the problem is, it's not about enjoying the experience.

796
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:19,587
It's not about testing yourself. It's about making the best game possible.

797
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:23,210
So don't fall in the trap of sort of entertaining yourselves

798
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,392
for the sake of making your game the best the game can be.

799
00:38:25,412 --> 00:38:27,133
Up on the wall.

800
00:38:28,122 --> 00:38:29,003
Lesson number 13.

801
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:32,044
We go back to 2004, a set called Unhinged.

802
00:38:32,624 --> 00:38:34,745
So this was a humorous set which broke a lot of rules

803
00:38:34,785 --> 00:38:35,786
that we never normally break,

804
00:38:36,346 --> 00:38:37,867
because magic's often very competitive.

805
00:38:37,887 --> 00:38:39,047
And the product wanted to remind people

806
00:38:39,248 --> 00:38:40,308
that game can be fun.

807
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:41,489
Magic can be fun.

808
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,750
So we put a silver border on it to say,

809
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,110
you can't even play these in tournaments.

810
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,211
It's non-tournament legal.

811
00:38:47,231 --> 00:38:49,933
Okay, so in it, we had a mechanic called Gotcha.

812
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:52,405
So here's how gotcha worked.

813
00:38:52,626 --> 00:38:53,887
If this card was in your graveyard,

814
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:55,548
if your opponent did a certain thing,

815
00:38:55,948 --> 00:38:58,250
this card particularly, if they said the word kill or destroy,

816
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,591
which happened to be the name of the card,

817
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:02,233
you could say gotcha, and you could get it back

818
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:02,914
from your graveyard.

819
00:39:03,594 --> 00:39:04,795
And there are all sorts of gotcha effects.

820
00:39:05,156 --> 00:39:07,578
If they said a number, if they touched the table,

821
00:39:07,818 --> 00:39:10,220
if they flicked their cards, if they touched their face,

822
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,641
if they laughed.

823
00:39:13,442 --> 00:39:16,105
If they laughed, you could say gotcha and get it back.

824
00:39:16,952 --> 00:39:19,074
So what was the best way to win this game?

825
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:21,915
Well, don't talk, because you might say something.

826
00:39:22,536 --> 00:39:24,297
You know, don't interact, because you might do something.

827
00:39:24,837 --> 00:39:25,778
Don't do anything fun.

828
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:27,799
You know, heaven forbid you laugh.

829
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,081
So leave this to lesson number 13.

830
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:35,244
Make the fun part also the correct strategy to win.

831
00:39:36,705 --> 00:39:39,506
It's not the player's job to find the fun.

832
00:39:40,307 --> 00:39:44,550
It is your job as a game designer to put the fun where they can't help but find it.

833
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:48,961
Because when players sit down to a game, there's an implied promise from the game designer.

834
00:39:49,381 --> 00:39:53,763
The game designer says, if you do what the game tells you to do, it will be an enjoyable

835
00:39:53,803 --> 00:39:54,323
experience.

836
00:39:55,483 --> 00:39:59,264
So the players will do whatever the game tells them to achieve the desired goals, usually

837
00:39:59,304 --> 00:39:59,624
to win.

838
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:02,345
Even if that isn't fun, they'll do it.

839
00:40:12,048 --> 00:40:14,688
And when the game is done, if the players didn't have fun...

840
00:40:18,414 --> 00:40:19,895
They will blame the game.

841
00:40:21,835 --> 00:40:22,956
And rightfully so.

842
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:26,337
Because you, the designer, have messed up.

843
00:40:27,157 --> 00:40:28,977
You have not delivered on the promise.

844
00:40:29,298 --> 00:40:32,739
They did what you asked, you didn't fulfill your end of the bargain.

845
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:37,040
So remember, you have to make sure that what it takes to succeed at your game is the very

846
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,000
thing that makes it fun.

847
00:40:39,009 --> 00:40:40,392
Fun cannot be tangential.

848
00:40:40,753 --> 00:40:43,278
It has to be the core component of your game experience.

849
00:40:43,779 --> 00:40:46,465
So lesson number 13, make the fun part

850
00:40:46,605 --> 00:40:48,128
also the correct strategy to win.

851
00:40:48,927 --> 00:40:51,268
And I see this mistake being made all the time.

852
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:54,970
Where like, they find something fun and then add other things around it.

853
00:40:55,311 --> 00:41:00,113
And the people, like I, I, we do these things where we watch through a window and you see how your audience is playing the game.

854
00:41:00,433 --> 00:41:01,774
And sometimes they go the wrong path.

855
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:03,315
And they don't do what you expect them to do.

856
00:41:03,595 --> 00:41:04,195
Well guess what?

857
00:41:04,615 --> 00:41:07,577
If they find un-fun parts of your game, you put them there.

858
00:41:08,077 --> 00:41:11,519
You know, make sure that the fun part is you guide them there and they find it.

859
00:41:11,659 --> 00:41:14,220
Because that is what's going to make them love the game, is the fun part.

860
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,541
Well, make sure they find the fun part.

861
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:19,237
Up on the wall?

862
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:20,378
Lesson number 14.

863
00:41:20,419 --> 00:41:22,742
So this is Rise of the Eldrazi back in 2010.

864
00:41:22,782 --> 00:41:25,306
So obviously it had the Eldrazi in it.

865
00:41:25,907 --> 00:41:29,212
These guys were giant and alien and hungry.

866
00:41:29,252 --> 00:41:30,133
They were eating the world.

867
00:41:30,783 --> 00:41:34,024
So at Common we made a card called Ulamog's Crusher.

868
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:37,786
So he was giant, he was 8'8", which for a Common is pretty big.

869
00:41:38,406 --> 00:41:40,946
He was alien, look at him, he looks really weird.

870
00:41:41,307 --> 00:41:43,167
Also, most Magic cards are colored, he was colorless.

871
00:41:44,107 --> 00:41:44,828
And he was hungry.

872
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:46,548
He had an ability called Annihilator.

873
00:41:46,868 --> 00:41:48,929
And Annihilator had a number, and every time you attacked,

874
00:41:49,169 --> 00:41:51,810
your opponent had to sacrifice that many things.

875
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,390
So Annihilator 2 means every time you attack,

876
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,911
they had to sacrifice two things.

877
00:41:55,831 --> 00:41:57,511
So what would happen is we would play this,

878
00:41:57,551 --> 00:41:58,532
and we did some playtesting,

879
00:41:58,912 --> 00:42:00,372
and the players wouldn't attack with him.

880
00:42:01,537 --> 00:42:03,198
And we're like, what's going on?

881
00:42:03,598 --> 00:42:05,640
And what we learned was, they were afraid.

882
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,561
Here's this awesome creature, they finally got it out.

883
00:42:07,761 --> 00:42:09,502
They didn't want something bad to happen to the creature,

884
00:42:09,802 --> 00:42:10,943
so they weren't attacking with it.

885
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,584
But we knew that attacking with it was really good.

886
00:42:13,905 --> 00:42:14,925
How could we educate them?

887
00:42:14,985 --> 00:42:17,487
How could we get them to realize they needed to attack with it?

888
00:42:18,087 --> 00:42:19,068
Well, the solution was,

889
00:42:19,968 --> 00:42:21,109
force them to attack with it.

890
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,751
So we just said, okay, you have to attack.

891
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:25,612
We put this on one of the common cards,

892
00:42:26,212 --> 00:42:27,333
and when they attacked,

893
00:42:27,853 --> 00:42:29,214
they realized it was good.

894
00:42:30,792 --> 00:42:31,673
And they did it more.

895
00:42:32,353 --> 00:42:36,155
And so the key was, by forcing their hand, we educated them.

896
00:42:36,656 --> 00:42:39,858
So lesson number 14, don't be afraid to be blunt.

897
00:42:41,138 --> 00:42:42,539
Artists tend to prefer subtlety.

898
00:42:45,241 --> 00:42:47,422
They're taught, show, don't tell.

899
00:42:48,503 --> 00:42:50,184
But sometimes subtlety doesn't work.

900
00:42:51,484 --> 00:42:53,446
People can just miss the obvious.

901
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,608
For example, in magic, we use keywords

902
00:42:57,788 --> 00:42:59,990
to make sure that players can focus on the mechanics.

903
00:43:00,836 --> 00:43:03,757
But once upon a time, back in Ricadian Math back in 1999,

904
00:43:04,377 --> 00:43:05,998
we had mechanics, but we didn't name them.

905
00:43:06,218 --> 00:43:07,458
We didn't have keywords.

906
00:43:07,939 --> 00:43:09,699
And the number one question we got was,

907
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,780
why doesn't the set have mechanics?

908
00:43:12,961 --> 00:43:15,401
So sometimes to get your audience to understand,

909
00:43:15,642 --> 00:43:18,383
you have to be willing to embrace bluntness.

910
00:43:19,163 --> 00:43:21,264
I like to think of my creative tools as a toolbox.

911
00:43:21,784 --> 00:43:23,805
And sometimes you just need a hammer.

912
00:43:24,905 --> 00:43:27,266
So lesson number 14, don't be afraid to be blunt.

913
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:31,445
We as artists are taught subtlety, subtlety, subtlety, subtlety.

914
00:43:31,645 --> 00:43:33,268
And a lot of the times you want to be subtle,

915
00:43:33,469 --> 00:43:35,533
but that doesn't mean that you can't use bluntness

916
00:43:35,753 --> 00:43:38,097
when it's valuable and when it'll get across what you need to.

917
00:43:41,103 --> 00:43:41,723
Okay, lesson number 15.

918
00:43:42,764 --> 00:43:45,546
So I created something a while back called player psychographics.

919
00:43:46,066 --> 00:43:47,668
I took an advertising class, I told you earlier.

920
00:43:47,848 --> 00:43:50,209
There's a concept in advertising called psychographics

921
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,951
where you're trying to understand the emotional needs of your audience.

922
00:43:53,232 --> 00:43:54,613
Why are they buying your product?

923
00:43:55,113 --> 00:43:57,595
And so the idea was I created these three psychographics

924
00:43:57,855 --> 00:43:59,916
to explain why our players played the game.

925
00:44:00,196 --> 00:44:01,898
What emotionally did they get out of the game?

926
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,399
So first, there was Timmy or Tammy.

927
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,761
There was Johnny or Jenny.

928
00:44:07,422 --> 00:44:08,022
And there was Spike.

929
00:44:09,875 --> 00:44:13,255
Okay, so Timmy, or Tammy, wants to experience something.

930
00:44:13,295 --> 00:44:16,736
It's very much about the visceral thrill, the excitement,

931
00:44:16,896 --> 00:44:19,636
or, you know, it could be the emotional bonding with friends,

932
00:44:19,697 --> 00:44:23,517
but it was about the, how they felt about it, what, how it made them feel.

933
00:44:25,117 --> 00:44:27,498
Jenny or Johnny wanted to express something.

934
00:44:27,538 --> 00:44:30,839
The game was about showing other people something about themselves

935
00:44:31,019 --> 00:44:34,359
through the lens of the game, through their deck, through card combos,

936
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:37,020
through some means by which they can express something about themselves.

937
00:44:38,235 --> 00:44:43,418
Spikes want to prove something, that the game is a tool to show that they're capable of doing something.

938
00:44:43,918 --> 00:44:46,320
Often winning, but that's not the only thing Spike can be focused on,

939
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:49,702
but they use the game as a resource to prove they're capable of doing something.

940
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:52,483
So let's talk about Ravnoga in 2005.

941
00:44:53,144 --> 00:44:55,405
We made a card called Molten Sentry, so here's what it did.

942
00:44:55,825 --> 00:44:57,306
You flipped a coin when it came into play,

943
00:44:57,926 --> 00:45:01,328
and then either you got a 5-2, meaning 5 power, 2 toughness,

944
00:45:01,648 --> 00:45:03,229
or you got a 2 power, 5 toughness.

945
00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:05,290
And both of them were interesting, both were balanced,

946
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,471
they both were interesting things you could get.

947
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,941
So let's look at the psychic graphics and examine this.

948
00:45:09,342 --> 00:45:11,802
I'm going to take Johnny and Jenny out because this card really isn't for them.

949
00:45:12,382 --> 00:45:13,683
Okay, so we have coin flipping.

950
00:45:14,723 --> 00:45:15,963
Oh, Timmy likes coin flipping.

951
00:45:16,203 --> 00:45:17,684
That's exciting. What's going to happen?

952
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:18,684
Timmy enjoys that.

953
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:20,665
We had balanced outcomes.

954
00:45:21,325 --> 00:45:22,185
Okay, Spike likes that.

955
00:45:22,225 --> 00:45:25,286
Spike likes both things are good things and I can have interesting choices.

956
00:45:25,526 --> 00:45:26,246
Spike enjoys that.

957
00:45:26,606 --> 00:45:27,547
Let's flip them for a second.

958
00:45:28,327 --> 00:45:29,067
Balanced outcomes.

959
00:45:29,147 --> 00:45:29,367
Well...

960
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:32,269
That's not really what Timmy's looking for.

961
00:45:32,309 --> 00:45:33,410
Timmy's looking for exciting things.

962
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:34,290
When he flips the coin,

963
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:36,352
ooh, is it a bad thing or a good thing?

964
00:45:36,392 --> 00:45:37,552
He wants an exciting moment.

965
00:45:38,433 --> 00:45:41,514
And coin flipping, Spike doesn't want to flip a coin.

966
00:45:41,874 --> 00:45:42,775
He's all about skill.

967
00:45:43,275 --> 00:45:44,216
He wants to win the game.

968
00:45:44,536 --> 00:45:45,536
Yes, there are interesting choices,

969
00:45:45,556 --> 00:45:46,697
but he wants to make the choices.

970
00:45:46,857 --> 00:45:48,118
He doesn't want the choices to be random.

971
00:45:48,658 --> 00:45:49,898
So what happened when this card came out?

972
00:45:54,082 --> 00:45:56,264
The Timmies didn't like it because it was too spiky,

973
00:45:56,744 --> 00:45:58,685
and the Spikes didn't like it because it was too Timmy.

974
00:45:59,286 --> 00:46:01,387
You know, that the card, like,

975
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,408
but trying to make different people happy,

976
00:46:03,448 --> 00:46:04,469
we made nobody happy.

977
00:46:04,989 --> 00:46:06,210
So lesson number 15 is,

978
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,132
design the component for the audience it's intended for.

979
00:46:09,973 --> 00:46:12,034
So for example, when you aim to please everyone,

980
00:46:12,234 --> 00:46:13,415
you often please no one.

981
00:46:14,275 --> 00:46:16,377
All your players don't want the same thing out of your game.

982
00:46:17,177 --> 00:46:18,138
It's important to understand

983
00:46:18,198 --> 00:46:19,959
what different kind of things your audience want,

984
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,441
and to understand what kind of different players you have.

985
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:27,421
So when you design any one component, you know which part of the audience it's intended for.

986
00:46:27,441 --> 00:46:32,105
Okay, him. This is for him. Protection from everything.

987
00:46:32,445 --> 00:46:36,989
Ooh, that's exciting! And then you design the component for that audience.

988
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:42,233
If other players don't like it, it doesn't matter. It's not for them.

989
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:47,224
So lesson number 15, design the component for the audience it's intended for.

990
00:46:47,844 --> 00:46:51,066
You have lots of different players, they're going to want lots of different things.

991
00:46:51,326 --> 00:46:55,447
You have to figure out each component, who it is for, maximize it for that person.

992
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,108
Forget everybody else, it doesn't matter.

993
00:46:57,128 --> 00:46:59,529
Remember, you want someone to love everything, not hate it.

994
00:46:59,709 --> 00:47:03,170
It doesn't matter if people hate things, make sure each component is for the person it's

995
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:03,630
made for.

996
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:06,011
And you'll make something for everybody, you shouldn't make something for the...

997
00:47:06,451 --> 00:47:09,392
The person who hates this card, hopefully will love that card, but you don't...

998
00:47:09,572 --> 00:47:11,153
Focus the card on who you're making it for.

999
00:47:13,337 --> 00:47:14,377
Okay, lesson number 16.

1000
00:47:15,018 --> 00:47:17,099
So this is Unglued, this was the first silverboarded set.

1001
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:18,600
Very humorous.

1002
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,042
So, in it we had a card called BFM, Big Furry Monster.

1003
00:47:22,402 --> 00:47:22,963
And it was big, 99.99.

1004
00:47:23,003 --> 00:47:26,605
I just talked about how 8-8 was big for common.

1005
00:47:26,965 --> 00:47:28,586
Well, 99.9 is just big.

1006
00:47:28,606 --> 00:47:30,908
In fact, you'll notice he has two earrings on him.

1007
00:47:31,568 --> 00:47:33,129
Those were the two biggest creatures in magic

1008
00:47:33,149 --> 00:47:34,170
at the time we printed this card,

1009
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:36,071
which was an 11-11 and a 12-12.

1010
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:37,311
But he's big, he's 99.99.

1011
00:47:37,532 --> 00:47:40,253
And it was so big, it had to go on two cards.

1012
00:47:40,493 --> 00:47:42,355
You actually had to draw both cards in your hand to play it.

1013
00:47:43,348 --> 00:47:46,749
So this inspired me to make this card, which was, well,

1014
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:48,009
what if it went the opposite direction?

1015
00:47:48,049 --> 00:47:50,649
Instead of it being so big that it requires two cards,

1016
00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:52,550
what if it was so small that two of them

1017
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,150
could fit on one card?

1018
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:55,910
An invasion back in September 2000,

1019
00:47:56,371 --> 00:47:58,271
I made this card, or a bunch of these cards,

1020
00:47:58,611 --> 00:47:59,551
known as split cards.

1021
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:02,452
So at the time, who was in favor of it?

1022
00:48:04,112 --> 00:48:04,912
I was in favor of it.

1023
00:48:06,233 --> 00:48:07,273
Bill Rose was in favor.

1024
00:48:07,333 --> 00:48:08,213
He was the lead designer of the set.

1025
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:11,034
He's currently our VP of R&D. And Richard Garfield

1026
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:11,454
was in favor.

1027
00:48:11,474 --> 00:48:12,754
He's the creator of Magic.

1028
00:48:13,692 --> 00:48:14,533
Who was opposed to this?

1029
00:48:16,574 --> 00:48:17,154
Everybody else.

1030
00:48:19,035 --> 00:48:22,737
And it wasn't, by the way, that they were thinking of what was best for magic.

1031
00:48:22,757 --> 00:48:24,038
They were concerned.

1032
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:26,299
They felt like that wasn't what a magic card looks like.

1033
00:48:26,419 --> 00:48:27,620
That isn't how we do things.

1034
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,941
And that it wasn't that the people who were against it,

1035
00:48:30,461 --> 00:48:32,582
they had the best idea of magic in mind.

1036
00:48:32,602 --> 00:48:33,683
They were trying to help the game.

1037
00:48:33,923 --> 00:48:38,025
But they really felt like we were breaking some boundary we shouldn't be breaking.

1038
00:48:38,899 --> 00:48:43,901
But Bill and Richard and I, we were steadfast and we slowly convinced everybody that it

1039
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:44,821
was the right thing to do.

1040
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:47,502
And so eventually in Invasion, the split cards came out.

1041
00:48:48,182 --> 00:48:49,202
What was the player reaction?

1042
00:48:51,283 --> 00:48:51,763
No.

1043
00:48:53,904 --> 00:48:54,444
They loved them.

1044
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:55,744
They were very, very popular.

1045
00:48:56,344 --> 00:48:59,125
So much so that we've revisited and done them a bunch of different times.

1046
00:48:59,605 --> 00:49:04,047
So lesson number 16 is, be more afraid of boring your players than challenging them.

1047
00:49:05,077 --> 00:49:08,278
So in my 20 years at Wizards, I've done a lot of groundbreaking things.

1048
00:49:09,058 --> 00:49:14,380
And every time someone, usually multiple people, came out of the woodwork, full of passion

1049
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,241
and purpose, and they said to me, you can't do that.

1050
00:49:17,601 --> 00:49:18,442
It's too risky.

1051
00:49:18,802 --> 00:49:19,682
It will hurt the game.

1052
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:23,664
But interestingly, I've also created my share of boring mechanics.

1053
00:49:24,164 --> 00:49:27,805
Yet, very few people ever had passion and purpose to stop me from making those.

1054
00:49:28,946 --> 00:49:29,346
Why?

1055
00:49:30,386 --> 00:49:33,828
Because people fear challenging the players more than boring them.

1056
00:49:34,571 --> 00:49:35,652
But I think that's backwards.

1057
00:49:36,312 --> 00:49:38,434
When you try something grandiose and it fails,

1058
00:49:39,094 --> 00:49:41,716
the players will forgive you because they recognize

1059
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:43,497
that you were trying to do something awesome.

1060
00:49:43,957 --> 00:49:45,038
They respect the attempt.

1061
00:49:47,019 --> 00:49:48,840
And they stick around to see what you'll do next.

1062
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:53,384
But when you bore the players, there's no such forgiveness.

1063
00:49:53,864 --> 00:49:55,345
Because making the same mistake is not

1064
00:49:55,365 --> 00:49:56,486
the same as making a new one.

1065
00:49:56,966 --> 00:49:58,747
When you bore the players, they resent you.

1066
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,428
Sometimes they stop playing.

1067
00:50:01,223 --> 00:50:03,083
So as game designers, I think we have it reversed.

1068
00:50:03,644 --> 00:50:05,344
Challenging the players isn't the bigger threat.

1069
00:50:05,884 --> 00:50:07,845
The greatest risk is not taking risks.

1070
00:50:08,745 --> 00:50:12,486
So lesson number 16, be more afraid of boring your players than challenging them.

1071
00:50:12,907 --> 00:50:14,927
That I really know there's a lot of risk aversion of,

1072
00:50:15,067 --> 00:50:17,248
oh no, oh no, what if you go something wrong?

1073
00:50:17,528 --> 00:50:19,229
But respect your players.

1074
00:50:19,249 --> 00:50:22,089
When you try new and different things, even when you fail,

1075
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:25,250
that's better received when you just do boring things.

1076
00:50:25,551 --> 00:50:27,631
So be willing to challenge your fans.

1077
00:50:27,671 --> 00:50:28,732
They'll appreciate it.

1078
00:50:30,426 --> 00:50:33,007
Okay, lesson number 17, back to Invasion.

1079
00:50:33,848 --> 00:50:35,449
So this had a multicolor theme.

1080
00:50:35,669 --> 00:50:38,190
What that means is that the card had two or more colors

1081
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:39,090
in its casting cost,

1082
00:50:39,651 --> 00:50:41,132
and in Invasion, you were encouraged to play

1083
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:42,392
as many colors as you could.

1084
00:50:43,493 --> 00:50:45,054
So Invasion was very popular.

1085
00:50:45,314 --> 00:50:47,575
So years later, we wanted to do another multicolor set.

1086
00:50:47,595 --> 00:50:50,576
It ended up being Ravnica in October of 2005.

1087
00:50:51,077 --> 00:50:52,417
So the question we said to ourselves is,

1088
00:50:52,738 --> 00:50:54,218
how can we do another multicolor theme

1089
00:50:54,478 --> 00:50:55,719
without it being too similar?

1090
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,960
So let's look at the back of a Magic card.

1091
00:50:58,928 --> 00:51:02,390
This is what we know as the color wheel, or the five colors of magic.

1092
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:05,391
So what if we made one small change, we thought?

1093
00:51:05,751 --> 00:51:08,473
What if instead of encouraging players to play as many colors as possible,

1094
00:51:08,793 --> 00:51:13,215
all five, we encouraged them to play as few as possible, two.

1095
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,937
The reason two and not one is it wouldn't be multicolored if it was one.

1096
00:51:16,697 --> 00:51:18,338
And we looked at that with five colors,

1097
00:51:18,638 --> 00:51:21,500
we realized that there are ten combinations.

1098
00:51:24,613 --> 00:51:26,134
So there were ten two-color pairs.

1099
00:51:26,394 --> 00:51:29,536
So we mapped them, and then we made guilds out of them.

1100
00:51:29,757 --> 00:51:30,937
We gave them each a flavor.

1101
00:51:30,977 --> 00:51:34,200
Like the Azores, for example, was all about law and order and control.

1102
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,120
It was white and blue.

1103
00:51:35,421 --> 00:51:39,203
It took the elements of white and blue, combined them, and they were the people that made the

1104
00:51:39,243 --> 00:51:40,845
laws in the world, and they were the bureaucrats.

1105
00:51:41,085 --> 00:51:44,627
And for each of the guilds, we gave them a very specific flavor matching that.

1106
00:51:45,048 --> 00:51:48,710
And then we took the guilds, and we put them in a city world, and we made Ravnica.

1107
00:51:49,511 --> 00:51:50,512
What was the player response?

1108
00:51:52,233 --> 00:51:52,813
They loved it.

1109
00:51:53,491 --> 00:51:56,292
Ravnogra is the most popular world we've ever created.

1110
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:57,753
The players just ate it up.

1111
00:51:58,273 --> 00:52:02,214
So lesson number 17 is, you don't have to change much to change everything.

1112
00:52:02,935 --> 00:52:05,596
So my metaphor here is, I'm a bad cook.

1113
00:52:06,696 --> 00:52:08,437
So it's my responsibility to make the vegetables.

1114
00:52:09,057 --> 00:52:11,558
So for example, I need to take the peas out and put them in here.

1115
00:52:11,918 --> 00:52:12,218
My job.

1116
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:15,360
So every time I put some peas in, and then I say,

1117
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,780
yeah, that's not enough peas.

1118
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,741
So I put more peas in.

1119
00:52:18,381 --> 00:52:20,482
And then I'm like, eh, that's not enough peas.

1120
00:52:20,862 --> 00:52:21,582
So I put more peas in.

1121
00:52:22,078 --> 00:52:24,279
And then I'm like, I did, and I put more Ps in.

1122
00:52:25,099 --> 00:52:27,559
And what ends up happening every time is this.

1123
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,320
Way too many Ps.

1124
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,400
I think game designers treat game components

1125
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,741
like I treat Ps.

1126
00:52:36,061 --> 00:52:37,241
You're never sure if there's enough,

1127
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:38,801
so you keep sticking more in.

1128
00:52:39,942 --> 00:52:41,602
Then in the end, you have too much,

1129
00:52:42,022 --> 00:52:43,162
and this causes problems.

1130
00:52:44,122 --> 00:52:45,943
You create extra complexity for your players,

1131
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:48,263
you muddy the message of your game,

1132
00:52:49,003 --> 00:52:50,743
and you waste resources you could use later.

1133
00:52:51,775 --> 00:52:53,417
So I've had a slight change in perspective.

1134
00:52:54,858 --> 00:52:57,020
So instead of asking how much do I need to add,

1135
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,782
I now ask how little do I need to add.

1136
00:53:01,664 --> 00:53:03,946
So lesson number 17, you don't have to change much

1137
00:53:04,206 --> 00:53:04,967
to change everything.

1138
00:53:05,487 --> 00:53:07,289
When I look back at Ravnica, we really

1139
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:10,171
changed one tiny element of it, but that was enough.

1140
00:53:10,211 --> 00:53:12,733
That one tiny change had a world of differences.

1141
00:53:13,214 --> 00:53:14,875
No one's going to confuse Invasion with Ravnica.

1142
00:53:14,915 --> 00:53:15,976
They're radically different sets,

1143
00:53:16,016 --> 00:53:17,137
even though they're both multicolor.

1144
00:53:18,858 --> 00:53:19,359
Up on the wall.

1145
00:53:21,046 --> 00:53:22,407
Okay, lesson number 18.

1146
00:53:23,068 --> 00:53:25,790
So every week, I write a weekly design column

1147
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:26,871
known as Making Magic.

1148
00:53:27,591 --> 00:53:28,732
I do 50 new columns a year.

1149
00:53:29,113 --> 00:53:30,654
I get a two-week break where we rerun columns.

1150
00:53:31,034 --> 00:53:32,656
And I've been doing this since 2002.

1151
00:53:33,717 --> 00:53:34,878
So some weeks are theme weeks.

1152
00:53:35,058 --> 00:53:35,838
I have to write to a theme.

1153
00:53:35,878 --> 00:53:36,879
It's Goblin Week or whatever.

1154
00:53:36,899 --> 00:53:37,700
I have to write about goblins.

1155
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:39,241
Some weeks are open-ended.

1156
00:53:39,261 --> 00:53:40,222
I can write whatever I want.

1157
00:53:41,103 --> 00:53:42,124
Which is harder to write,

1158
00:53:42,704 --> 00:53:44,726
the theme week or the open-ended week?

1159
00:53:46,167 --> 00:53:47,108
The open-ended week.

1160
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:51,866
Because the theme week forced my hand and make me explore options I might not.

1161
00:53:52,847 --> 00:53:59,709
So which is harder to design? The theme set or the open-ended set? The open-ended set.

1162
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:04,031
Because the theme set forced me down paths I might not normally have gone.

1163
00:54:04,771 --> 00:54:08,693
So this gets us to lesson 18. And if you follow my podcast or read my column,

1164
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:12,494
this is probably the one I'm most famous for. Restrictions breed creativity.

1165
00:54:13,646 --> 00:54:16,931
So there's a myth about creativity that the more options available,

1166
00:54:17,131 --> 00:54:18,494
the more creative people can be.

1167
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:21,960
But this actually contradicts how we know how most brains work.

1168
00:54:22,701 --> 00:54:24,364
You see, the brain is an amazing organ.

1169
00:54:24,384 --> 00:54:25,105
It's very smart.

1170
00:54:25,927 --> 00:54:27,528
So when you're asked to solve a problem,

1171
00:54:28,028 --> 00:54:30,208
it checks its data banks and it asks itself,

1172
00:54:30,808 --> 00:54:32,049
have I solved this problem before?

1173
00:54:32,649 --> 00:54:35,749
And if the answer is yes, it solves it in the exact same way.

1174
00:54:36,370 --> 00:54:37,130
The exact same way.

1175
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,890
So what it does is it uses the same neural pathways

1176
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:41,751
and does exactly what you did before.

1177
00:54:42,311 --> 00:54:43,591
Now most of the time this is efficient.

1178
00:54:43,911 --> 00:54:46,852
It lets you avoid relearning tasks each time you do them.

1179
00:54:47,552 --> 00:54:49,433
But it causes a problem with creative thought

1180
00:54:49,773 --> 00:54:51,553
because if you use the same neural pathways,

1181
00:54:52,233 --> 00:54:53,374
you get to the same answers.

1182
00:54:54,034 --> 00:54:55,594
And with creativity, that's not your goal.

1183
00:54:56,275 --> 00:54:57,276
So here's the trick I've learned.

1184
00:54:57,716 --> 00:54:59,737
If you want to get your brain to get to new places,

1185
00:55:00,358 --> 00:55:02,339
start from somewhere you've never started before.

1186
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,082
That's why each time I start a new expansion,

1187
00:55:05,442 --> 00:55:07,103
I make sure to have a different vantage point.

1188
00:55:07,363 --> 00:55:11,386
I always say, let's start this place from a set I've never started before.

1189
00:55:11,907 --> 00:55:15,089
This is forcing me to think in different ways and create new problems to solve,

1190
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:17,471
which results in new ideas and new solutions,

1191
00:55:17,931 --> 00:55:21,394
which means that restrictions aren't an obstacle, but a valuable tool.

1192
00:55:22,135 --> 00:55:24,496
So you can make use of restrictions to help you be more creative.

1193
00:55:25,482 --> 00:55:27,723
Lesson 18, restrictions breed creativity.

1194
00:55:28,303 --> 00:55:29,604
So once again, I can't stress enough,

1195
00:55:30,184 --> 00:55:32,765
having restrictions, in fact, if you don't have restrictions,

1196
00:55:33,165 --> 00:55:34,045
make restrictions.

1197
00:55:34,305 --> 00:55:36,546
For example, my favorite article I ever wrote,

1198
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:38,527
I asked for the audience to give me two topics,

1199
00:55:38,687 --> 00:55:40,647
a magic topic and a non-magic topic.

1200
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:43,068
The magic topic was my biggest design mistakes,

1201
00:55:43,468 --> 00:55:45,209
and the non-magic topic was dating.

1202
00:55:46,649 --> 00:55:47,810
I would have never written that article,

1203
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,010
I never would have written that article,

1204
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,411
and it's my favorite article I've ever written.

1205
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:52,892
It's called The Air is Human, it's a Topical Blend 1,

1206
00:55:52,972 --> 00:55:53,292
check it out.

1207
00:55:54,052 --> 00:55:54,712
Put this up on the wall.

1208
00:55:55,304 --> 00:55:55,884
Okay, lesson number 19.

1209
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:58,605
So, one of my jobs, I'm a spokesperson for Magic.

1210
00:55:59,086 --> 00:56:00,687
I interact with various sources of media.

1211
00:56:00,707 --> 00:56:02,948
I do a lot of interviews, including social media,

1212
00:56:03,548 --> 00:56:05,469
where I'm active on numerous platforms.

1213
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:07,530
I have over 80,000 followers.

1214
00:56:08,231 --> 00:56:09,912
I probably spend the most time on Tumblr, though,

1215
00:56:10,412 --> 00:56:11,012
because of this.

1216
00:56:11,753 --> 00:56:12,513
This is my blog.

1217
00:56:13,306 --> 00:56:16,070
AKA blogatog, magic joke for the non-magic players out there.

1218
00:56:16,751 --> 00:56:20,136
So in four years, I've made over 64,000 posts,

1219
00:56:20,656 --> 00:56:25,082
and of them, I've answered over 60,000 questions.

1220
00:56:25,663 --> 00:56:26,064
Four years.

1221
00:56:26,877 --> 00:56:28,558
I interact a lot with our fans.

1222
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:31,119
And not just online, but also in person.

1223
00:56:31,479 --> 00:56:33,620
So after this, by the way, in the wrap-up room,

1224
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,582
which is across the street at level 2 in West Hall,

1225
00:56:36,862 --> 00:56:40,164
I will be there, I will sign cards, I will take pictures,

1226
00:56:40,284 --> 00:56:41,844
I will shake hands, I will answer questions,

1227
00:56:42,085 --> 00:56:43,845
but that's not going to be in this room, it's going to be there.

1228
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:45,867
So afterwards, if you're interested, I will be there,

1229
00:56:46,127 --> 00:56:48,428
and I'll stay until I talk to everybody and sign everything.

1230
00:56:49,729 --> 00:56:51,469
Anyway, that leads to the lesson, lesson number 19.

1231
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:54,071
Your audience is good at recognizing problems

1232
00:56:54,231 --> 00:56:55,291
and bad at solving them.

1233
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:57,630
So my metaphor here is a doctor appointment.

1234
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:59,171
What does a doctor always do first?

1235
00:56:59,771 --> 00:57:00,851
They ask how you're feeling.

1236
00:57:01,371 --> 00:57:03,492
Because you know better than the doctor how you're feeling.

1237
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:06,352
But the doctor doesn't often ask you how to solve the problem,

1238
00:57:06,593 --> 00:57:08,333
because they're better equipped than you to do that.

1239
00:57:09,033 --> 00:57:10,073
Same is true in game design.

1240
00:57:10,554 --> 00:57:13,354
Your players have a better understanding of how they feel about your game.

1241
00:57:13,654 --> 00:57:14,955
You're trying to create emotional response?

1242
00:57:15,115 --> 00:57:16,215
Well, they know what that is.

1243
00:57:16,755 --> 00:57:18,536
They can tell easier when something is wrong.

1244
00:57:18,876 --> 00:57:20,836
And they're excellent at identifying problems.

1245
00:57:21,576 --> 00:57:23,917
But, they're not as equipped to solve those problems.

1246
00:57:24,217 --> 00:57:26,237
They don't know your tools, they don't know your limitations,

1247
00:57:26,417 --> 00:57:28,018
they don't know a lot of things they would need to know.

1248
00:57:28,418 --> 00:57:30,919
And so, they're not particularly good at solving problems.

1249
00:57:31,339 --> 00:57:34,159
So please use your audience as a resource to discover what's wrong,

1250
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,080
but take it with a grain of salt when they offer solutions.

1251
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:40,541
So lesson number 19, your audience is good at recognizing problems

1252
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:41,882
and bad at solving them.

1253
00:57:42,382 --> 00:57:43,222
And I must stress again,

1254
00:57:43,402 --> 00:57:45,263
they're really, really good at recognizing problems.

1255
00:57:45,283 --> 00:57:46,263
They're a great barometer.

1256
00:57:46,503 --> 00:57:47,863
You should use that as a resource.

1257
00:57:48,203 --> 00:57:48,323
But...

1258
00:57:49,863 --> 00:57:50,764
Let's take it with a grain of salt.

1259
00:57:50,784 --> 00:57:51,865
The solutions don't always work.

1260
00:57:53,786 --> 00:57:54,847
Okay, lesson number 20.

1261
00:57:55,268 --> 00:57:56,309
So when you look up on the board,

1262
00:57:56,329 --> 00:57:58,731
I started to realize that, for example,

1263
00:57:59,872 --> 00:58:02,675
if I'm trying to make sure that I match human nature,

1264
00:58:03,075 --> 00:58:05,477
it's a little easier if my audience feels a sense of ownership

1265
00:58:05,677 --> 00:58:09,421
because they're less inclined to feel like it's contradicting human nature.

1266
00:58:10,222 --> 00:58:12,444
Or, for example, if I want them to...

1267
00:58:12,464 --> 00:58:14,365
Ah, I can't read it.

1268
00:58:15,108 --> 00:58:18,370
If I want them to understand the difference between, if I push them to make it more,

1269
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:21,851
if I push it to make it more compelling and not boring,

1270
00:58:22,172 --> 00:58:27,394
I'm more likely to make it something, is that right? I'm sorry.

1271
00:58:27,594 --> 00:58:30,016
I'm more likely to make sure that it's something that will be compelling to them.

1272
00:58:31,136 --> 00:58:35,258
Or, if I have them explore, it's more likely that the details will matter,

1273
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:37,399
because if they're exploring, they'll want to find the details

1274
00:58:37,459 --> 00:58:39,040
and that makes them more interested in exploring.

1275
00:58:39,921 --> 00:58:42,722
And what I found was, as you started connecting these different things,

1276
00:58:43,042 --> 00:58:44,203
they all start coming together.

1277
00:58:50,771 --> 00:58:51,772
which is lesson number 20.

1278
00:58:52,692 --> 00:58:53,733
All the lessons connect.

1279
00:58:54,574 --> 00:58:55,795
That as I learned each lesson,

1280
00:58:56,255 --> 00:58:58,597
I began to see they existed in relationship to one another.

1281
00:58:59,477 --> 00:59:00,678
And that's when I realized

1282
00:59:01,179 --> 00:59:02,880
that they weren't separate lessons after all.

1283
00:59:05,002 --> 00:59:06,363
In fact, when I was going to give my talk today,

1284
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:07,563
the original title was

1285
00:59:08,304 --> 00:59:10,966
20 Years, One Very Complex Interconnected Holistic View of Game Design.

1286
00:59:12,047 --> 00:59:13,228
But it didn't seem quite as catchy.

1287
00:59:14,102 --> 00:59:16,063
So lesson number 20, all the lessons connect.

1288
00:59:16,203 --> 00:59:18,125
I didn't really give you 20 lessons today.

1289
00:59:18,205 --> 00:59:20,247
I gave you one really large interconnected,

1290
00:59:20,987 --> 00:59:23,049
but I broke them apart for easy digesting.

1291
00:59:23,089 --> 00:59:24,751
So let's put this on the wall.

1292
00:59:26,252 --> 00:59:26,352
OK.

1293
00:59:26,432 --> 00:59:27,353
So guys, take your pictures.

1294
00:59:31,897 --> 00:59:32,697
OK, did everybody get a picture?

1295
00:59:34,178 --> 00:59:34,899
Well, quickly get a picture.

1296
00:59:35,279 --> 00:59:36,661
And I know some of you guys like lists.

1297
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:38,282
So here it is in list form.

1298
00:59:43,849 --> 00:59:44,570
Everybody got the picture?

1299
00:59:47,491 --> 00:59:50,253
So that is 20 years, 20 lessons.

1300
00:59:56,276 --> 00:59:57,277
Do I have time for questions?

1301
01:00:00,499 --> 01:00:02,360
Real quick, do I have time for questions?

1302
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,161
I don't know my time.

1303
01:00:05,122 --> 01:00:06,022
Do I have time for questions?

1304
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:07,543
Yes or no?

1305
01:00:07,563 --> 01:00:08,144
I don't know my time.

1306
01:00:08,164 --> 01:00:09,384
Do I have time for questions?

1307
01:00:09,804 --> 01:00:09,945
What?

1308
01:00:12,225 --> 01:00:14,527
Wrap up? Oh no, sorry, I don't have time for questions.

1309
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,489
So thank you guys very much for joining me again.

1310
01:00:16,809 --> 01:00:18,791
Once again, please fill out your forms.

1311
01:00:19,651 --> 01:00:21,573
It's very important, if you liked what happened today,

1312
01:00:21,673 --> 01:00:23,694
or you didn't like what happened today, let them know.

1313
01:00:23,714 --> 01:00:27,958
But when I got here, they gave me a deck that showed the people,

1314
01:00:27,978 --> 01:00:31,180
the 50 best talks of last year, to inspire me to be one of those 50 people.

1315
01:00:31,481 --> 01:00:32,822
So if you liked this, please fill it out.

1316
01:00:33,002 --> 01:00:35,063
If you liked it or didn't like it, please fill it out either way.

1317
01:00:36,104 --> 01:00:37,345
But thank you guys very much for coming.
