00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:13,122
Hi everybody. I'm Zach Johnson. I'm the creative director of Asymmetric.

2
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:18,348
15 years ago my company started working on a multiplayer web RPG called Kingdom of Loathing.

3
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,876
And last year we released our follow-up to that game, West of Loathing, which is what I'm here to talk about today.

4
00:00:27,776 --> 00:00:40,841
Specifically, what I want to talk about is the tools and workflow and process that we had for actually making the game work, because it turns out when I talk to people about it, it's weirder than those kind of things normally are.

5
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:51,677
Like, for real, work on the game started about two years before it came out, and in the year or so prior to that,

6
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:56,379
I started out by just spending a bunch of time thinking about the kind of game that I wanted to make.

7
00:00:56,959 --> 00:01:04,521
Put together a document that was a really, like, just preliminary description of what I was imagining the game was going to be like.

8
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:10,903
This is how a scene is laid out, this is what interactions look like, this is more or less what it's going to consist of.

9
00:01:12,968 --> 00:01:15,591
kind of had a vague idea of how big I wanted the world to be

10
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:17,993
and what I wanted the main sort of story to be about.

11
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:22,317
Worth noting, I wanted the main story to be extremely nominal.

12
00:01:22,658 --> 00:01:24,379
Like, it has always kind of been.

13
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:30,915
my dream to play a Bethesda game that had no main quest line, just wander around a world

14
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:34,778
doing side quests, and I don't think that we could have actually gotten away with making

15
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:41,223
a game like that, so we just settled for making one with kind of a bad nominal main quest

16
00:01:41,243 --> 00:01:44,525
line, kind of letting everything else be the actual strengths of the game.

17
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:51,674
After I had kind of put it together, showed it to the team, everybody was like, yeah, we should make a thing like this.

18
00:01:52,975 --> 00:01:58,258
We hired a Unity programmer for, like, an afternoon to make a proof of concept.

19
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:03,380
I handed him some sprites, he put them in a 3D scene, made a little dude that could walk around in them.

20
00:02:03,621 --> 00:02:08,183
Because we had no idea up to that point, like, this is the same art style that Kingdom of Loathing uses,

21
00:02:08,263 --> 00:02:12,205
but Kingdom of Loathing is kind of an illustrated Oregon Trail sort of thing,

22
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:15,627
where you just kind of click a button to say what you want to do and then it tells you what happens.

23
00:02:16,347 --> 00:02:21,949
see a little bit of that in this too, but I didn't know if it was gonna sell at all in an actual kind of

24
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:26,010
diorama 3d space and this prototype was

25
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,591
Promising enough that we decided all right. We should definitely make this game

26
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,612
So now we should decide what this game is actually going to consist of so

27
00:02:34,553 --> 00:02:35,633
Riff the other writer and I

28
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:44,554
got together at the office over a week or so at a big whiteboard and just started laying out like,

29
00:02:44,575 --> 00:02:48,237
all right, this is what you're going to do in this game. This is what the world is going to

30
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:53,881
consist of. And this will come back a lot in various ways, both good and bad, that we kind

31
00:02:53,921 --> 00:03:00,346
of started with the giant world and what was going to be in it and then sort of added story stuff

32
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:00,626
later.

33
00:03:02,322 --> 00:03:07,025
We laid out the main quest where basically the first part is you have to find some dynamite to get through this pass.

34
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:08,646
Second part is you have to build a bridge.

35
00:03:08,946 --> 00:03:17,072
And the third point is that you have to deal with a sort of crazy bureaucrat in San Francisco to get him to let you build the railroad the rest of the way in.

36
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:22,936
And we wanted there to be, because we wanted to sort of diminish the importance of the main quest,

37
00:03:22,976 --> 00:03:25,257
we wanted there to be a lot of different ways to get through each of those.

38
00:03:25,577 --> 00:03:28,620
We also wanted you to be able to get through it without combat if you wanted to.

39
00:03:30,279 --> 00:03:32,881
that became much more of an important goal as time went on,

40
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:34,022
but it started out as like, well,

41
00:03:34,062 --> 00:03:35,604
it should at least be possible if you know

42
00:03:35,644 --> 00:03:36,845
what you're doing to get through this

43
00:03:36,905 --> 00:03:38,326
without fighting anything.

44
00:03:39,627 --> 00:03:40,968
And so we just sort of had this list

45
00:03:41,249 --> 00:03:43,250
of a bunch of different ways that you could solve

46
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,213
each of the main quest line segments.

47
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:48,855
And we more or less stuck to this.

48
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,237
There's definitely some stuff on here that we didn't do

49
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:52,778
or some stuff that changed over time.

50
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:56,381
And I think the bottom one on the third list

51
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:58,623
says Cthulhu's butt, which.

52
00:04:00,268 --> 00:04:02,750
That's not a thing I think we ever intended to put in.

53
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,211
It must have just been written down as a joke

54
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:05,812
and I forgot to edit it out of the photograph.

55
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:10,175
So then we kind of divided the world map up

56
00:04:10,256 --> 00:04:11,937
into nine sections.

57
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:14,158
Later, one of those sections was cut for scope

58
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:16,060
and then we pretended we were leaving space for DLC.

59
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:20,273
Decided all right in each of these sections

60
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:25,580
What sort of individual areas are you going to be able to go to and we kind of had this list all right?

61
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,223
So in in region a which is the kind of starting area?

62
00:04:28,263 --> 00:04:32,408
There's going to be there's going to be a couple of camps of robbers that you have to go arrest

63
00:04:32,448 --> 00:04:35,132
There's going to be a ranch. It's going to be a fort a couple cemeteries a

64
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:40,896
a clown area for the circus progression thing, and a mine.

65
00:04:41,237 --> 00:04:43,758
And we essentially just laid out all nine of the regions

66
00:04:43,898 --> 00:04:46,360
and decided, all right, this is the kind of thing

67
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,822
that is going to be in each of these.

68
00:04:50,063 --> 00:04:51,184
And then we kind of had like, all right,

69
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:52,444
this is the scope of the game.

70
00:04:52,464 --> 00:04:55,126
There's gonna be a hundred places that you go,

71
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,668
and each of them is gonna have some monsters to fight,

72
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,630
some items to get, some little puzzles to solve,

73
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,290
a little bit of whatever.

74
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:06,569
This next part gets slightly weirdly out of order

75
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:08,390
because there was not really a good order to do it in.

76
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,212
So once we actually spun up, at this point,

77
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,254
all right, we know what this game is gonna be,

78
00:05:13,294 --> 00:05:15,455
we know what we're gonna do, so we hired Victor,

79
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:16,716
the programmer, and Wes, the animator,

80
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:19,378
to come on full time and actually start building the game.

81
00:05:20,378 --> 00:05:22,019
We had done some tools work before that,

82
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:23,520
but I'll get to that in a second.

83
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:29,303
Over the course of development, when it came time to actually implement an area, what I

84
00:05:29,343 --> 00:05:35,949
would typically do was take a sheet of paper to the bar at the Alamo Draft House, and in

85
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:39,331
the hour before the movie that I was going to watch started, I would decide what was

86
00:05:39,351 --> 00:05:40,392
going to go in an area.

87
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:49,476
Often this would change in scope a little bit over the course of actually implementing it or something wouldn't work or I would

88
00:05:49,676 --> 00:05:54,178
Would have drawn a space too crowded and need to spread things out and make things easier to get to or easier

89
00:05:54,698 --> 00:05:58,019
easier to read as a player moving through the space

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,361
but essentially I wanted on a sheet of paper all of the

91
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:08,303
important interactions in an area so like what this list is if you could read my handwriting is

92
00:06:09,697 --> 00:06:15,181
Everything that you can mess with in there that does anything to the game state and every time there's an encounter every time there's a

93
00:06:15,482 --> 00:06:17,363
specific conversation that we had an idea for

94
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:24,848
We had this internal Google sheet that sort of kept track of how done all of these regions were

95
00:06:25,962 --> 00:06:28,844
The problem with this is that the number of regions that there were kept changing,

96
00:06:28,884 --> 00:06:31,987
and so it was very, it was sort of difficult to tell from this how done we actually were.

97
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:36,530
And also, all the red things are things that never got checked one way or another,

98
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:41,134
because I realized that this just represents the state that the spreadsheet was in when we abandoned it,

99
00:06:41,354 --> 00:06:44,117
rather than the state that it was in when we finished the game.

100
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:49,021
Like sound effects, if you looked at this, you would think there were no sound effects at all in the game,

101
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:51,703
but we had just given up on the spreadsheet by the time we added sound.

102
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:56,720
The broad categories of stuff that we needed to get done here, like that first column,

103
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,303
con, is just like, do we know what this area is?

104
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:02,726
Because there were a lot of things where we had said, okay, well, we definitely decided

105
00:07:02,746 --> 00:07:05,509
there was a mine here, but we don't really have an idea for a mine.

106
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:10,053
So once we get that idea, we're going to put an X in there and actually give the region

107
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:10,533
a name.

108
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:13,016
Layout was just sort of...

109
00:07:13,924 --> 00:07:18,930
Do the rooms exist? Is there stuff in them? Is progress blocking objects?

110
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,533
Like, are they wired up to actually block progress and stuff like that?

111
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:25,619
Scripts are, can you do the stuff that you're going to do in the room?

112
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:30,765
Like, if you go to interact with the thing, is there at least a baseline version of that interaction coded?

113
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,042
items, if there were any new items in the game that were specific to that region, then that was

114
00:07:37,062 --> 00:07:41,165
where I would keep track of whether they were done or not. Monsters is whether there were actually

115
00:07:41,185 --> 00:07:45,587
any fights there, which often there weren't. As I said, as we got further and further into the

116
00:07:45,787 --> 00:07:51,850
development of the game, combat became less and less of a focus, both in terms of quality

117
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,193
and development time and also just importance to overall gameplay.

118
00:07:58,342 --> 00:08:01,850
Way is just, did we remember to hook up the doors to get into this room?

119
00:08:02,051 --> 00:08:04,416
Because when we were testing, we could just teleport around.

120
00:08:04,477 --> 00:08:08,065
So sometimes we would just forget and there would be no way for the player to actually get to this thing.

121
00:08:09,746 --> 00:08:13,987
Second section was all the sort of actual final assets for everything. Is it written?

122
00:08:15,407 --> 00:08:20,209
Is there commentary for... so there's you get a kind of a companion character that runs around

123
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:23,889
with you and we decided that one of the ways that we would create a tremendous amount of

124
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:29,231
extra work for Riff was to make it so every room that you were in with your partner they would

125
00:08:29,251 --> 00:08:34,932
have a different thing to say about it and a different little conversation to have. CPG was my...

126
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:41,348
metric for whether it was a loathing game, does this room have a couple of

127
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:42,271
pointless gags?

128
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,898
They didn't all need it, but that was where,

129
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:49,120
like, in that opening mine,

130
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,722
like, there was just nothing going on out there,

131
00:08:51,862 --> 00:08:54,444
so then I added this thing where you could

132
00:08:54,844 --> 00:08:56,445
explain to your partner how all of this

133
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:58,847
mining equipment worked, even though you didn't know

134
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:00,047
how the mining equipment worked,

135
00:09:00,087 --> 00:09:02,669
and it just gave you a perk called mine-splaining.

136
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:04,570
That's the kind of pointless gag

137
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:06,912
the couple of pointless gags column represented.

138
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:08,873
And that stuff, I think.

139
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:16,446
That is where a lot of the kind of memorable soul of the game lives and I think it was

140
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:24,130
It was the right instincts to actually try to track that and sort of try to shoehorn that stuff in even if there wasn't a

141
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,911
Great idea for it to begin with

142
00:09:27,646 --> 00:09:38,649
Link was whether there was anything in the area that sort of connected you to another area or sent you somewhere else or like gave you a quest that that unlocked a new place that you could go.

143
00:09:40,569 --> 00:09:55,253
Let's see. Art. Art was whether I had done the art for it or not. And yeah, sound effects. And then the rest of that stuff is like if there were monsters in the area, is there something that differentiates them from other monsters? Spoiler, the answer is almost always no.

144
00:09:57,114 --> 00:10:01,381
Do they have basic AI hooked up and have I requested whatever animations?

145
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:07,810
The animation column didn't really belong in combat because often I would want a character in a scene that was doing something weird

146
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,956
and I would need to get an animation from Wes for that that wasn't specifically part of combat.

147
00:10:13,744 --> 00:10:18,868
So, the tools that we had, we built these before we actually hired up the full team.

148
00:10:19,388 --> 00:10:24,853
And Chris Moyer, who has been the web developer programmer for Kingdom of Loading for many,

149
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:26,995
many years, built all these tools for us.

150
00:10:27,355 --> 00:10:31,399
And so this is the thing that we use to actually edit scenes.

151
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:35,883
And you'll see later, this looks a lot like the tools that we've been using for our web

152
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,663
game for a long time.

153
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:43,374
The basic way that the data works in this game is we store a bunch of stuff in a MySQL database,

154
00:10:43,454 --> 00:10:47,938
and then there is a big export that happens into the game client, so we don't need to actually be

155
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:56,445
in Unity to add content to the game, which I think was the single decision we made that made it so

156
00:10:56,465 --> 00:11:01,890
this game was able to be as big as it was, which I think is probably the primary strength of the game.

157
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:07,357
I think most of the reason that anyone who is impressed with this game is impressed with

158
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:12,139
it is because it doesn't look like it is going to be this giant, sprawling, potentially 30-hour

159
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:17,580
long thing, but because we made it very, very easy to put stuff in it, we were able to put

160
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,021
a lot of stuff in it in the time that we had.

161
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:23,543
So like for any object in a scene, there's just a bunch of properties about it.

162
00:11:23,604 --> 00:11:27,286
There's some just basic stuff like what sprite does it use?

163
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:32,591
If it requires an actual Unity prefab to have Wes's animations running on it,

164
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:37,354
we can have it just kind of replaced with one of those at the time that it's rendered in the scene.

165
00:11:38,736 --> 00:11:40,597
extend forward and extend back are like,

166
00:11:40,878 --> 00:11:44,321
can you walk past it without triggering its script?

167
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:47,083
There's the condition which is like,

168
00:11:47,263 --> 00:11:49,825
based on game logic states, does it show up at all?

169
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:51,347
And that's why you can kind of see like,

170
00:11:51,487 --> 00:11:55,310
the house is sort of Schrodinger's arson,

171
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,373
like, because there's the non-burned down version

172
00:11:58,393 --> 00:11:59,634
of the house and there's the burned down version

173
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:01,275
of the house and they just have different flag

174
00:12:01,315 --> 00:12:02,837
conditionals on them depending on what you've done.

175
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,621
In there, if you click on edit on the script link,

176
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:10,384
it takes you to, this is the actual code

177
00:12:10,704 --> 00:12:14,527
that the designers wrote to handle all of the game logic.

178
00:12:14,888 --> 00:12:19,191
And this started out as a scripting language

179
00:12:19,231 --> 00:12:20,693
that I developed for Kingdom of Loathing

180
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:23,015
so that the writers who were not programmers

181
00:12:23,135 --> 00:12:25,917
could do really basic stuff like just dialogue trees,

182
00:12:26,217 --> 00:12:28,960
just conversations with multiple paths through them.

183
00:12:30,281 --> 00:12:34,882
We didn't build a lot of extra functionality into that version of the language

184
00:12:35,122 --> 00:12:41,725
because we made a thing where it would just let you execute arbitrary PHP code in it,

185
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:43,906
which is super safe, web development practice.

186
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:50,748
But also, we didn't need to write actual abstracted functions to handle game logic stuff

187
00:12:50,848 --> 00:12:54,330
because I had already done it in the PHP code and we could just run that.

188
00:12:55,436 --> 00:13:13,138
This scripting language became, as I'll show you later, way, way more complicated and robust and important and powerful over time and has just been really key to how much we were able to accomplish in the game beyond what I expected to be able to do with it.

189
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:20,226
We also internally have this tagging system that also came from Kingdom of Loathing,

190
00:13:20,326 --> 00:13:26,209
where more or less anywhere in any of the data, we can leave a note for anybody else on the team,

191
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:32,491
and then when that guy logs on to the admin tools, they just see a list of everything that's been annotated to them.

192
00:13:32,631 --> 00:13:36,533
So if there's a thing I put in a thing in an area that Riff thought he was done writing,

193
00:13:36,573 --> 00:13:38,254
and Riff needed to do some writing, he could do it.

194
00:13:38,394 --> 00:13:41,635
If I had a guy and I needed him to be dancing, I could say,

195
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:42,776
Wes, make this guy dance.

196
00:13:44,637 --> 00:13:46,198
Sometimes Kevin would leave a note that said,

197
00:13:46,238 --> 00:13:49,920
Zach, what were you trying to do with this script?

198
00:13:50,421 --> 00:13:51,862
I can't even figure out what it would have done

199
00:13:51,902 --> 00:13:52,882
if it had been working.

200
00:13:55,004 --> 00:13:57,345
So there are a lot of advantages to the way

201
00:13:57,365 --> 00:13:59,727
that we decided to do this with just the web tools

202
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:04,490
for developing the content and the game

203
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,791
basically being the client.

204
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:08,392
One that I didn't create a bullet point for,

205
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,233
but that I think is actually pretty important is,

206
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:16,738
We tested all of the content by actually playing the game, because that was the only way that we could see it.

207
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:25,482
We always knew we would make an interaction, and the only way for us to test that interaction was to go experience that interaction the way that the player was going to.

208
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:29,257
the tools were extremely familiar to us.

209
00:14:29,397 --> 00:14:32,439
On the left is the thing that we use to make an item in Kingdom

210
00:14:32,459 --> 00:14:34,060
of Loathing, and on the right is the thing

211
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,862
that we use to make an item in West of Loathing.

212
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:38,163
And you can see that in 15 years,

213
00:14:39,064 --> 00:14:40,285
things have gotten a lot shinier.

214
00:14:41,406 --> 00:14:45,589
But the scripting language.

215
00:14:47,425 --> 00:14:53,948
When I wrote the original design doc, I had very low expectations for the kind of scale

216
00:14:53,988 --> 00:14:59,390
of interactivity that we were going to be able to pull off in environments. It never occurred to me

217
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,973
that we would be able to like make an NPC walk around in a room, because like I was still in

218
00:15:04,993 --> 00:15:09,895
this Kingdom of Loathing model where it was like, what would this game be like if it was on an Apple

219
00:15:10,435 --> 00:15:14,477
2 and it was still me making it. But...

220
00:15:15,491 --> 00:15:19,955
so much extra stuff got added to the scripting language that we started to be able to do stuff.

221
00:15:20,055 --> 00:15:29,784
It's not super meaningful to look at, but there's an area in the game where there's bandits that will run around trying to prevent you from getting into buildings,

222
00:15:29,844 --> 00:15:31,945
and people that will run away from you when you get close to them.

223
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:34,828
We were able to do things that I was not expecting to be able to do,

224
00:15:34,888 --> 00:15:38,011
which is spatial puzzles that involve moving things around in areas.

225
00:15:40,234 --> 00:15:45,667
The fact that all of that stuff was abstracted out into the scripting language meant that any of us could do it.

226
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:48,053
It didn't have to be just the person who knew how Unity worked.

227
00:15:51,109 --> 00:15:57,173
we were able to make a change in the data and then just hit R in the build and it loads the change

228
00:15:57,234 --> 00:16:01,617
into the data. So it was very much, it was very comfortable to me because I grew up writing games

229
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:06,581
in BASIC and you know there was no debugger. You just write some code and then run the game. If it

230
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:10,024
didn't work you would change something and then run it again. Your changes were reflected immediately.

231
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:14,227
That's how Kingdom of Loathing worked. I get that's not how software development works, but

232
00:16:15,048 --> 00:16:18,150
Victor was able to make it so we could pretend that we were making this game in the 80s.

233
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:24,519
Biggest advantage, the designer does not have to use Git.

234
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:26,880
And as the designer, this is the thing

235
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,482
that I'm the most happy about, about that whole process.

236
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:33,605
The art pipeline, kinda similar.

237
00:16:34,966 --> 00:16:35,746
Starting with the hardware.

238
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:39,708
Pilot Precise V5 Extra Fine Rolling Ball Pen.

239
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:42,330
Ever since the beginning, that is what all

240
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,690
Kingdom of Loathing and West of Loathing art

241
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,451
has been drawn with.

242
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,853
I did gradually discover better and better

243
00:16:47,893 --> 00:16:50,054
kinds of paper to draw on over time.

244
00:16:50,414 --> 00:16:52,115
This is what I landed on now.

245
00:16:52,255 --> 00:16:54,096
There's no bleed, so the lines are real clean.

246
00:16:55,377 --> 00:16:57,478
And so everything looks great when you put it

247
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:01,000
in the cheapest version of Canon's scanner

248
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,401
that they sell on Amazon at whatever time

249
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:04,762
the previous one breaks.

250
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:12,994
All of that stuff goes into PaintShop Pro 9. Best hundred dollars I ever spent in 2004.

251
00:17:14,856 --> 00:17:20,544
I did at some point update it to version 9.01. Still not totally sure that was a good idea.

252
00:17:23,887 --> 00:17:25,689
A lot of people have asked me, including myself,

253
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,690
over the years, why don't I just learn Photoshop?

254
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:30,853
And I just, every time on any given day,

255
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,635
it's like, well, I could spend a week learning Photoshop

256
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:36,437
or I could spend a week making a week's worth of art

257
00:17:36,757 --> 00:17:38,839
in PaintShop Pro 9 real, real fast.

258
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:42,201
And so far, someday a version of Windows

259
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,562
is gonna come out that won't run this

260
00:17:43,802 --> 00:17:45,083
and then I have to retire.

261
00:17:47,885 --> 00:17:49,567
That pipeline is basically, I...

262
00:17:51,228 --> 00:17:55,890
save the item, like I work on the item, work on the sprite, work on the image, the whatever,

263
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:01,392
in PaintShop. And then I have a macro that saves out a copy of it that is just black and white.

264
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:08,595
I am not even good at using PaintShop Pro 9, so I have no idea how to actually edit art

265
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:13,676
when it's anti-aliased, so it's literally just a pixel at a time, black and white.

266
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:15,297
is how all of my editing works.

267
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:19,118
Nothing in the world wants art to be like that,

268
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,939
so that macro also saves a copy of it

269
00:18:21,979 --> 00:18:24,099
that's sort of shrunk down so that there's

270
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,940
some built-in anti-aliasing, puts it

271
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,520
into a repository that gets then synced via Dropbox

272
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,581
to a directory on our web server where

273
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:31,561
all of the other stuff is.

274
00:18:31,941 --> 00:18:34,382
And then there is another key that you

275
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:36,122
can hit in the game that.

276
00:18:36,986 --> 00:18:39,348
requests like a tarball of all of those sprites,

277
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:41,450
and then some magic happens that Victor wrote

278
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,370
that I don't understand,

279
00:18:42,711 --> 00:18:44,773
that then puts those sprites in the game.

280
00:18:44,893 --> 00:18:47,715
So in addition to being able to change the writing

281
00:18:47,915 --> 00:18:50,298
and the scripting and the interactions

282
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,238
and the locations of things,

283
00:18:51,258 --> 00:18:53,200
you can also just add new art,

284
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:56,423
more or less as soon as I save it,

285
00:18:56,603 --> 00:18:57,524
it's just in the game,

286
00:18:57,744 --> 00:18:59,446
which was just awesome.

287
00:19:01,448 --> 00:19:02,729
Several advantages of this pipeline.

288
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:06,810
This slide was gonna be about how reusable the sprites were

289
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,270
and how we didn't have to have that many of them,

290
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,511
but then I looked and there were like 3,400 sprites

291
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:12,511
that I had made, so I'm like, oh,

292
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,952
maybe this slide is about how that didn't seem

293
00:19:14,972 --> 00:19:16,632
to take very long to make all those sprites.

294
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:21,173
Again, live updates, like you just have to hit the button,

295
00:19:21,473 --> 00:19:24,034
get new sprites in there, and again,

296
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:27,375
I did not have to use Git to make changes to the project.

297
00:19:29,674 --> 00:19:35,639
This was going to be about the writing pipeline, but the writing pipeline is essentially exactly the same as the design pipeline,

298
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,702
because all of the writing just lives in those scripts,

299
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:43,948
which probably eventually is going to bite us in the ass if we ever want to do anything like localize,

300
00:19:44,008 --> 00:19:46,510
but we'll solve that problem when we come to it.

301
00:19:47,992 --> 00:19:49,913
Advantage there is that the writer also doesn't have to use Git.

302
00:19:54,149 --> 00:20:05,169
The things that I feel like didn't work super well about these processes is a good closing segment for a talk about what went right and wrong.

303
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:15,920
There was a lot of this by the end the starting with the world first and not necessarily having a like

304
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,541
Complete vision of what any of the individual things were going to be

305
00:20:19,881 --> 00:20:21,881
Especially as you get further west in the game

306
00:20:21,901 --> 00:20:26,602
You notice that things get a little sparser and it's not because we wanted the verisimilitude of that

307
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:30,983
Region of the US being less populous. It was because like

308
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:38,646
man, did we make a lot of mines already and do we not have an idea for what this mine would be and

309
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:38,746
that

310
00:20:40,387 --> 00:20:47,209
kind of had this knock-on effect of it was pretty difficult to tell how close to finished we were because

311
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:56,193
It's not like I can just put an item on my calendar that is have an idea for what this mine is it kind of

312
00:20:56,253 --> 00:20:58,454
has to happen if it's gonna be any good and

313
00:20:58,474 --> 00:20:59,154
it was

314
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:06,209
we should have spent more time actively brainstorming stuff in the beginning and had a better idea of

315
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:12,333
exactly what stuff was going to be. This also resulted in a lot of the storylines,

316
00:21:12,393 --> 00:21:17,415
because we definitely came at this from a world-first and not a story-first point of view,

317
00:21:17,836 --> 00:21:22,819
a lot of the stuff just kind of ended as a dud because we never really had any idea of where

318
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:27,821
it was going, so never really, we didn't really build up to anything, so we weren't able to pay

319
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:30,223
off what we had been building up to, so it was just sort of...

320
00:21:30,683 --> 00:21:37,344
whatever we made up the day that we had to write the last section of like the Necromancer questline or the cow stuff that

321
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:42,206
At least the cow stuff was so hidden that hardly anybody sees how disappointing it is in the end

322
00:21:46,227 --> 00:21:48,067
So on the production side I

323
00:21:50,007 --> 00:21:56,289
am sorry Kevin for how rough the last couple of months of working on this game were because it was

324
00:21:57,201 --> 00:22:02,365
you know, like, because we didn't have VO, for instance, which I think was a great move on our part,

325
00:22:02,926 --> 00:22:11,553
it was possible to change things up until the last second, and so there was not really ever a good way

326
00:22:11,593 --> 00:22:15,797
of knowing, like, Kevin was never sure when he was done going through an area because he didn't know

327
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:20,321
that we hadn't gone back and changed something else. I really wish that somebody would make

328
00:22:20,401 --> 00:22:24,344
something that would allow a bunch of people to collaborate on a piece of software.

329
00:22:25,238 --> 00:22:30,443
and kind of track the changes that they made in a comprehensible way, but that must be

330
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:32,305
really hard because certainly no one's ever done it.

331
00:22:34,828 --> 00:22:45,038
And the abstraction between the work of actually making the game and the actual code that runs

332
00:22:45,098 --> 00:22:46,480
on your computer when you play the game.

333
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:53,207
basically made it so none of us really had to get all that far out of our wheelhouses,

334
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:56,428
which was great for getting a lot of stuff done in a hurry, but it wasn't really great

335
00:22:56,468 --> 00:22:58,169
for sort of growing our skill sets.

336
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:02,691
Like, I now have this, you know, I have a lead credit on this game that's in Unity,

337
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:04,752
and I know nothing about Unity.

338
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:07,213
And that...

339
00:23:08,091 --> 00:23:11,614
You know, the game turned out okay and people seemed to like it and it sold pretty well.

340
00:23:11,694 --> 00:23:15,238
So I feel like it's a normal person would sit here and say,

341
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:19,141
oh yeah, we did things that we were supposed to be doing and everything worked out fine.

342
00:23:19,522 --> 00:23:26,809
But I can't help feeling like having to be a little bit more involved in each other's processes there

343
00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:30,912
would have resulted in a little bit more growth internally for the team.

344
00:23:33,097 --> 00:23:34,899
And yeah, so if there are any questions

345
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:35,900
about anything other than Unity,

346
00:23:37,161 --> 00:23:38,442
I can answer them at the mic's here.

347
00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:39,322
Oh, I'm supposed to remind you,

348
00:23:40,023 --> 00:23:42,245
fill out the evaluations for the talk.

349
00:23:43,946 --> 00:23:45,027
Do the first part that you liked,

350
00:23:45,087 --> 00:23:47,369
don't remember the last part where it kind of fizzles out.

351
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,993
If you were in here from the session before,

352
00:23:52,073 --> 00:23:52,913
scan your badge on the way out

353
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:53,974
so that they know to send it to you.

354
00:23:56,316 --> 00:23:57,577
I think that's all I was supposed to say.

355
00:24:14,062 --> 00:24:14,682
Hello.

356
00:24:14,722 --> 00:24:15,563
Hello.

357
00:24:15,683 --> 00:24:18,326
As a fan of Kingdom of Loathing from way, way back when,

358
00:24:18,346 --> 00:24:21,609
I was surprised to see how you guys launched West of Loathing

359
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:24,192
and how much different it was from that ragtag group

360
00:24:24,232 --> 00:24:24,653
of people.

361
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:26,174
You launched on Steam.

362
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,716
You had it as a box price.

363
00:24:27,736 --> 00:24:31,800
I was curious to see what kind of evolved that publishing

364
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,221
decision along the way.

365
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:40,958
We knew we wanted it to be a single-player experience that we didn't have to maintain for the rest of our lives,

366
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:44,061
because we already had one of those and it was already a lot of work.

367
00:24:46,666 --> 00:24:51,948
Basically, a couple years before we started on this, Kevin and I moved to San Francisco

368
00:24:52,008 --> 00:24:55,669
so that we could learn more about the games industry and how stuff worked.

369
00:24:56,229 --> 00:24:59,610
We probably would have done something like this earlier if we had had any idea how to

370
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:03,551
go about doing it, but we were sort of isolated in Phoenix, we didn't really know people,

371
00:25:03,731 --> 00:25:05,932
and we were very fortunate to...

372
00:25:07,076 --> 00:25:10,681
get the opportunity to share office space with Campo Santo when we first moved here and when

373
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:16,351
they first got started and so they were just this incredibly valuable resource in just telling us

374
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:19,195
how wrong we were about all of the ways that we thought the industry worked.

375
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:26,808
And so yeah, I think in a lot of ways we got very lucky that we sort of learned just in

376
00:25:26,888 --> 00:25:29,431
time how releasing an actual normal video game works.

377
00:25:30,231 --> 00:25:31,873
It was a lot of the same team, though.

378
00:25:31,953 --> 00:25:35,857
There were seven of us that made this game and four of us were original KOL people and

379
00:25:35,877 --> 00:25:41,824
were continuing to work on KOL the whole time, so nobody saw that contrast more than we did.

380
00:25:46,141 --> 00:25:52,324
Hey, first I wanted to say that the Spatoon progression was one storyline whose payoff

381
00:25:52,424 --> 00:25:53,885
was fantastic.

382
00:25:54,946 --> 00:25:58,908
It's one of the best things I've ever seen in games before, so that was great.

383
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:00,389
That is all riff, 100%.

384
00:26:00,729 --> 00:26:03,690
Alright, well send him my thanks.

385
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:08,273
But my question was, you said that at the end it seemed like you weren't able to get

386
00:26:08,293 --> 00:26:09,614
a lot of those storylines to land.

387
00:26:10,754 --> 00:26:10,974
Was...

388
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:14,860
I guess, why weren't you trying to spend more time on that?

389
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,981
Was it like, we have all this other game we have to make, or it's like, this is how good

390
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:20,541
it's going to be?

391
00:26:20,921 --> 00:26:27,243
I think part of it is just a kind of failure at the top of the company, because I don't

392
00:26:27,603 --> 00:26:30,684
actually think that stories and games are important.

393
00:26:30,764 --> 00:26:35,567
Important it's not it's not that I don't think that they're good or you know

394
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:42,570
Mature as a medium or whatever, but it's just never a priority for me like that's never what I care about when I play

395
00:26:42,611 --> 00:26:43,591
games and I

396
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:47,653
Fail to pay attention to the fact that I am nearly alone in that

397
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:52,988
And so yeah, it was just it like riff is way better at it than I am

398
00:26:53,068 --> 00:26:58,090
So I think like the circus storyline which was all him from beginning to end

399
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,292
Actually does have a narrative arc because he knows how those work

400
00:27:02,932 --> 00:27:07,534
And the stuff that I built most of the first parts of and then relied on him to kind of wrap up

401
00:27:08,154 --> 00:27:13,836
Because I don't know how those things work. There was just nowhere to go with the stuff that we had produced. All right. Thank you

402
00:27:16,626 --> 00:27:19,268
Hi, I got two questions if you don't mind.

403
00:27:20,249 --> 00:27:23,771
So first off, bringing West of Loathing to Switch,

404
00:27:24,592 --> 00:27:26,793
is there anything that you guys have to tweak specifically

405
00:27:26,913 --> 00:27:27,974
for that platform?

406
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:29,776
Like, I know when I played West of Loathing,

407
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:32,898
I played while I was on PC, so I clicked around

408
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:35,079
to see if there's any Easter eggs

409
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,320
or things I wasn't looking at.

410
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,842
I'll just click around wherever I was

411
00:27:38,922 --> 00:27:40,523
and I found some dope stuff.

412
00:27:40,964 --> 00:27:42,764
but obviously you can't do that with Switch,

413
00:27:42,804 --> 00:27:44,685
so is there any tweaks you're making specifically

414
00:27:44,765 --> 00:27:47,066
for just gamepad controls only?

415
00:27:47,606 --> 00:27:51,387
So there are a handful of things that require the mouse.

416
00:27:51,567 --> 00:27:52,507
Moving around on the map,

417
00:27:52,827 --> 00:27:54,788
it was just literally, you just have to click somewhere.

418
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:57,389
So there's a bunch of UI stuff that has to be overhauled,

419
00:27:57,629 --> 00:27:59,429
and not a bunch, there's a few UI things

420
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,450
that have to be completely overhauled to support Joysticks.

421
00:28:02,871 --> 00:28:05,671
But we wanted to make sure that you could play the game

422
00:28:05,792 --> 00:28:07,312
with the keyboard as much as possible.

423
00:28:08,307 --> 00:28:13,629
like the combat interface for instance was designed late enough that we were kind of imagining playing

424
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:18,792
it with a controller so that was like relatively easy. Inventory has been a ton of work on Victor's

425
00:28:18,812 --> 00:28:25,555
part which it's in great shape but it would it took some blood to get there. There's nothing

426
00:28:25,715 --> 00:28:27,196
really fundamental.

427
00:28:28,172 --> 00:28:30,552
We also were demoing it on iPads all of the time.

428
00:28:30,712 --> 00:28:32,553
So there was a thing like in the beginning

429
00:28:32,613 --> 00:28:34,854
where there's the cactus guy in the prologue town.

430
00:28:34,874 --> 00:28:36,955
You can get him to tell you that there's a shovel hidden

431
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:38,935
behind this outhouse by the mine.

432
00:28:39,295 --> 00:28:40,936
And it used to be that you actually had to WASD

433
00:28:40,956 --> 00:28:42,837
and walk behind it, but because of the way

434
00:28:42,877 --> 00:28:45,518
that clicking works, you can't click behind a sprite

435
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,258
that's on the screen.

436
00:28:46,538 --> 00:28:47,758
And so we ended up just changing the way

437
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:50,619
that interaction worked so that every part of the game

438
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:52,120
was accessible, whether you were moving around

439
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,060
with the keyboard or clicking around with the mouse.

440
00:28:54,461 --> 00:28:57,161
And so the joystick is basically a keyboard.

441
00:28:57,221 --> 00:28:57,322
So.

442
00:28:57,502 --> 00:29:00,642
So there's nothing about gameplay that has to change.

443
00:29:00,762 --> 00:29:02,843
It's just all UI considerations.

444
00:29:03,763 --> 00:29:05,864
And my second question is, how closely

445
00:29:05,904 --> 00:29:07,084
did you work with Ryan Icke?

446
00:29:08,465 --> 00:29:10,165
I think one of the highlights of the game

447
00:29:10,225 --> 00:29:13,506
is that the soundtrack is one of my favorite soundtracks ever.

448
00:29:13,906 --> 00:29:17,047
So in working with him, was it kind of like, all right,

449
00:29:17,067 --> 00:29:18,267
try and capture this feeling?

450
00:29:18,327 --> 00:29:19,688
Or just kind of like, hey, do your thing.

451
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:20,948
And if it works, it'll work.

452
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:22,188
If not, we're still going to use it.

453
00:29:22,709 --> 00:29:24,869
So for the sound design aspects, there

454
00:29:25,189 --> 00:29:26,750
was a lot more back and forth because.

455
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:36,395
Because of what this game looks like, Ryan couldn't necessarily look at a machine and actually understand what was happening when you used the machine.

456
00:29:36,435 --> 00:29:40,119
So there was a lot of back and forth about what this kind of thing actually sounds like.

457
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:46,464
On the music, I sent him a single Sheryl Crow song as reference.

458
00:29:47,582 --> 00:29:53,425
and then just kind of described in a sentence each of the songs that I wanted for Mood.

459
00:29:54,005 --> 00:29:58,327
And sometimes he would come back with one and I would say, well, okay, this is not exactly what

460
00:29:58,347 --> 00:30:02,148
I was looking for, but this is great for this other thing. Like, we ended up using everything

461
00:30:02,308 --> 00:30:10,132
that he sent, like even some rough drafts of things that ended up being replaced. But it was

462
00:30:10,672 --> 00:30:14,954
remarkable how just good everything that he produced was.

463
00:30:16,756 --> 00:30:16,916
Cool.

464
00:30:17,157 --> 00:30:17,377
All right.

465
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:17,677
Thank you.

466
00:30:21,422 --> 00:30:23,524
Hi.

467
00:30:24,165 --> 00:30:27,309
How was the design behind the combat and stuff like that

468
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:28,690
when you have the three classes and you

469
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:29,591
have all the partners?

470
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,554
How did you guys plan around having

471
00:30:32,235 --> 00:30:34,658
all of the combinations of this partner with this class for?

472
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,940
We didn't do a great job with that in the end, right?

473
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,801
Like that's the one thing that we got dinged on

474
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:41,902
in basically every review,

475
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:44,663
was that the combat was kind of uninspired.

476
00:30:44,863 --> 00:30:47,265
The engine for combat was very, very flexible

477
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:49,366
and very robust, and we had a lot of big plans

478
00:30:49,426 --> 00:30:50,467
for what we were gonna do with it.

479
00:30:50,847 --> 00:30:53,068
But then it sort of...

480
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:58,614
Because I have this desire in video games to just...

481
00:30:59,254 --> 00:31:03,375
I want a bunch of things that make numbers bigger, and I want to find those things everywhere,

482
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:08,176
I ended up just filling the world with stuff that made it impossible to balance combat.

483
00:31:08,236 --> 00:31:12,017
And we just kind of ran out of time and ran out of money, and so we decided, well, let's

484
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:15,978
just make it real easy so that it doesn't get in the way of the jokes, and try to do

485
00:31:15,998 --> 00:31:16,718
better next time.

486
00:31:17,298 --> 00:31:24,264
I think there's a section of the game where you're sort of playing a tabletop miniatures game with some guys in a fort.

487
00:31:24,624 --> 00:31:26,766
And those fights are pretty good, I think.

488
00:31:26,866 --> 00:31:32,891
And those kind of illustrate the promise of the combat system by being really, really constrained,

489
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:35,793
and they let us set some stuff up as puzzles.

490
00:31:36,113 --> 00:31:40,437
And we kind of wanted combat in general to be like that, but just weren't really able to pull it off.

491
00:31:40,457 --> 00:31:41,658
Okay. Thank you.

492
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,520
Thanks, everybody.
