1
00:00:06,127 --> 00:00:07,047
I'll probably start on page one.

2
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:12,472
Every year I come to GDC, I play a little game called

3
00:00:12,792 --> 00:00:14,293
Who's Corporate and Who's Indie?

4
00:00:15,394 --> 00:00:15,855
Wait a minute.

5
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:16,675
What happened there?

6
00:00:16,695 --> 00:00:17,756
There we go.

7
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:21,740
Who's holding down a full-time job with benefits, wearing a

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,363
logo shirt and staying at the W on the company dime, versus

9
00:00:25,463 --> 00:00:27,665
who's an independent contractor schmoozing for that

10
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:29,786
next gig, staying at the Mosser if they're lucky?

11
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,029
But more importantly, what were they last year?

12
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:36,888
More than with other game development and technology disciplines,

13
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:40,929
it seems like audio folks tend to spend their careers going back and forth

14
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:45,630
between holding down corporate gigs and freelancing from backroom project studios.

15
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,711
There are certainly some who have always had jobs and others

16
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:52,032
who have never produced audio except under contract.

17
00:00:52,572 --> 00:00:54,872
But if you work long enough in this industry,

18
00:00:55,313 --> 00:00:58,233
odds are you will eventually transition from one state to the other.

19
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:00,574
Now that's certainly been true in my case.

20
00:01:01,455 --> 00:01:07,679
More, in 1997, I went to my first GDC in San Jose as an indie, green and desperate.

21
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,763
Five years later, I showed up at GDC 2002, proudly wearing a Danger logo shirt,

22
00:01:14,243 --> 00:01:16,864
where I began my career as a mobile audio guy.

23
00:01:17,825 --> 00:01:21,367
Later, I got assimilated by Microsoft right before GDC 2008,

24
00:01:22,127 --> 00:01:23,848
but was back to be an indie for GDC 2010.

25
00:01:25,344 --> 00:01:30,457
I moved back to the Bay Area from Redmond in time for GDC 2013 and interviewed for an

26
00:01:30,537 --> 00:01:33,484
audio engineering job at Kik's Eye during the conference.

27
00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:39,500
In 2015, I attended the show as an indie again, wearing a flash leather jacket and with a

28
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,663
pocket full of twittering machine business cards in full schmoozing for work mode.

29
00:01:44,543 --> 00:01:48,346
And the first guy I ran into when I got off the BART was George the Fat Man Sanger.

30
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:50,327
I said, hey George, how you doing?

31
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:52,429
He looks at me and goes, Drescher, I got a job for you.

32
00:01:52,449 --> 00:01:53,730
And that was that.

33
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,132
A few months later, I'm living in lovely Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

34
00:01:57,632 --> 00:02:03,795
and attended GDC 2016 and 17 as senior audio engineer at Magic Leap, the world's most enigmatic

35
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:04,796
unicorn.

36
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:09,938
And now, here I am again, right back where I started from, living in California, working

37
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:13,760
as an independent contractor for my backroom studio, and kind of loving it.

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,483
So to discuss the pros and cons of working freelance versus holding down a job, I am

39
00:02:20,543 --> 00:02:23,685
lucky to be joined on stage by four distinguished colleagues.

40
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:26,792
who have also worked both sides of the equation.

41
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:30,273
In alphabetical order, Damian Kasbauer,

42
00:02:30,393 --> 00:02:32,754
currently at ArenaNet, formerly at PopCap,

43
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:34,774
plus many independent projects,

44
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:37,975
including the Oscar-winning Carni y Reyes.

45
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:41,816
Wilbert Roget, award-winning composer

46
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:45,177
for Call of Duty World War II, Lara Croft,

47
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:46,677
and numerous LucasArts titles.

48
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:50,118
Karen Widener, president and founder

49
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:51,978
of 8Ball Sound in Los Angeles,

50
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:54,239
formerly at Game Tracks and Sound Deluxe.

51
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,002
Guy Whitmore, currently independent, formerly at PopCap and Microsoft Game Studios.

52
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,863
And of course, you can call your humble moderator PDX.

53
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:08,766
So we'll now discuss five topics for eight minutes each and then do Q&A.

54
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:10,706
So the first topic, there's the topics.

55
00:03:10,746 --> 00:03:10,806
Art.

56
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:13,548
How does being corporate or indie help or hinder the creative process when producing

57
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,188
a game soundtrack?

58
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,390
So, let's start with the first topic.

59
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,532
How does being corporate or indie help or hinder the creative process when producing

60
00:03:22,572 --> 00:03:23,432
a game soundtrack?

61
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:29,961
Now for me, this kind of, one of the things I always do is I always maintain my own home

62
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:36,469
studio because I find being creative in, outside of the corporate environment where there's

63
00:03:36,529 --> 00:03:39,793
meetings and people running around, blah, blah, blah, and you can't really be as free

64
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:40,413
as you might like.

65
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:47,420
So, if I'm doing a piece of music, I would try and write in my home studio and then bring

66
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,125
it in to the corporate studio to implement and test.

67
00:03:53,406 --> 00:03:55,989
And this becomes important in some cases.

68
00:03:56,589 --> 00:04:03,150
One of the stories I like to tell is the time I was doing a music title for a kids game

69
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,351
where my monkey was the main character.

70
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:12,652
And so I was in my house, half naked, jump around the furniture making, ooh, ah, noises,

71
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,892
trying to come up with a melody, and my girlfriend walks in.

72
00:04:15,812 --> 00:04:17,033
No, really, honey, I'm working.

73
00:04:17,553 --> 00:04:24,674
So how do you guys feel about being corporate or creative in the corporate or indie environment?

74
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:28,760
This one's interesting.

75
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:30,786
I'm not very...

76
00:04:34,444 --> 00:04:38,667
shy about most things. So my first job at Sierra, it was an

77
00:04:38,787 --> 00:04:43,330
office door that might have been paper. And I wrote a lot of

78
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,852
music in that room and people just got used to it. So

79
00:04:47,072 --> 00:04:49,774
inhibitions, the only inhibition I really have is if I'm doing,

80
00:04:50,114 --> 00:04:53,936
you know, singing something. And that I like my privacy for. But

81
00:04:54,537 --> 00:05:01,041
I can be creative in a public place pretty much. So... But if

82
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:02,421
I'm not bugging people, that's a bonus.

83
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:08,524
I mean, I guess the obvious answer is that when you're in-house, you're being asked to

84
00:05:08,564 --> 00:05:10,985
be creative from the hours of nine to five.

85
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:11,846
Exactly.

86
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:12,066
Yes.

87
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,088
Can you really guarantee that that's when you'll have your melody?

88
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:16,689
Can you really guarantee that that...

89
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:20,632
Most of my ideas come really, really late at night and basically nocturnal.

90
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:25,695
And my creative process involves coming up with some blue sky idea at night, jotting

91
00:05:25,715 --> 00:05:29,417
it down in whatever way possible, sleeping on it, and then in the morning worrying about

92
00:05:29,477 --> 00:05:30,498
things like, is it good?

93
00:05:30,518 --> 00:05:31,939
How do I finesse it?

94
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,460
You know, all the details and all that kind of thing.

95
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:35,882
That was very difficult to do.

96
00:05:36,562 --> 00:05:40,966
Not only are you in here from set core hours or whatever,

97
00:05:41,386 --> 00:05:43,308
but also you're constantly going to be interrupted

98
00:05:43,388 --> 00:05:46,710
by meetings and by, maybe your friends come by

99
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,871
for whatever reason, I guess,

100
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:49,473
because we have offices and they like to just

101
00:05:49,493 --> 00:05:51,154
shut themselves out from the rest of the team or whatever.

102
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:54,136
And you're constantly being basically assaulted

103
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:57,539
by just all these other details that have nothing to do

104
00:05:57,619 --> 00:05:59,280
with your creative work.

105
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:04,983
Whereas if you are a freelancer, you can kind of set a creative space.

106
00:06:05,263 --> 00:06:06,743
It's a little easier to pull that off.

107
00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:11,845
So for me, that's sort of how it's gone and why I'll just get this out of the way.

108
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:16,446
I do prefer the freelance world, and I guess we'll kind of keep coming back to that.

109
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,350
Yeah, I was going to speak to that, too.

110
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,711
One of the things for me is a lot of times I get hired for

111
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:24,832
sort of specialized things that mainly work as a sound

112
00:06:24,872 --> 00:06:25,312
designer.

113
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:31,374
And I find being out of house, being indie, well, I guess

114
00:06:31,594 --> 00:06:34,154
half my career has about been indie and half in corporate

115
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:35,235
at this point or in house.

116
00:06:36,075 --> 00:06:39,016
I find I can focus more on specific things because of

117
00:06:39,396 --> 00:06:41,597
kind of what Wilbert was saying, where you're less

118
00:06:41,837 --> 00:06:43,017
interrupted with meetings.

119
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:46,518
And oftentimes, I'm not implementing either, which is

120
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:47,138
good and bad.

121
00:06:47,238 --> 00:06:47,378
But.

122
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,062
it kind of takes that focus just to the creation side.

123
00:06:51,902 --> 00:06:53,483
Like for instance, I worked on LawBreakers

124
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:56,225
doing Foley and sound design for that game

125
00:06:56,325 --> 00:06:57,465
for about eight months,

126
00:06:58,026 --> 00:07:00,247
and to just focus on the Foley and sound design

127
00:07:00,267 --> 00:07:02,628
for the cut scenes and not have to worry about other stuff.

128
00:07:02,748 --> 00:07:04,609
I think that helped the creative process a lot.

129
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:12,033
I'm just going to underline focus again. It's like the biggest deal, right? As a freelancer,

130
00:07:12,053 --> 00:07:19,958
yeah, sure, maybe I can dive into a technical system and really, you know, craft this elaborate

131
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:24,420
Faberge egg inside of some middleware integration with the game.

132
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:32,481
But that comes at the detriment of when you're in-house

133
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:34,102
creating that same system.

134
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,504
You may not have the same focus, but you have greater

135
00:07:36,564 --> 00:07:39,906
resources to maybe push the creativity of it in a

136
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:40,666
different direction.

137
00:07:40,706 --> 00:07:45,069
Instead of the insular system that you create abstracted

138
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:49,172
from the team outside the fence, you have the resources

139
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:51,874
of the team in real time that you can push forward the

140
00:07:51,934 --> 00:07:54,816
creativity deeper in that direction.

141
00:07:55,626 --> 00:08:01,588
Well, and that's actually a good point from the advantage of working in a corporate environment

142
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:06,710
is you have the ability to, from a creative point of view, bounce ideas off of people,

143
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,152
particularly people you know and trust and who are involved in the game.

144
00:08:10,654 --> 00:08:13,616
or the product in a similar manner that you are.

145
00:08:14,136 --> 00:08:14,837
That can be a match.

146
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:17,558
Whereas if you're just by yourself in your studio all day,

147
00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:20,140
which tends to happen on a regular basis,

148
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:24,803
sometimes you don't know if what you're doing is good or not.

149
00:08:24,823 --> 00:08:26,324
You don't really have anything to bounce it off of

150
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:27,484
until you then send it out,

151
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:29,966
and then maybe you hear something back, maybe you don't.

152
00:08:30,646 --> 00:08:32,107
Yeah, and that's true.

153
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:36,590
For instance, making stuff, in both cases for me,

154
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,291
I have to consciously make.

155
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:40,340
these barriers that you were talking about.

156
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,941
I was like, okay, even with freelance,

157
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:43,582
I still need to put like, okay,

158
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:44,523
from these hours to this hours,

159
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,584
I'm not gonna look at Facebook, I'm not gonna do this.

160
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:48,606
There's more discipline involved,

161
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,307
and it can be at midnight or whatever,

162
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:51,328
but there's still a discipline of,

163
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:52,969
yes, I'm gonna start at 10 and go.

164
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,491
But I also have to do that at work, it's harder,

165
00:08:56,871 --> 00:08:58,473
but I used to have this little door sign

166
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:00,634
I'd put on my thing that says, do not disturb.

167
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,898
So I would have these hours at work and you have to have that.

168
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,000
That's the only way I could do anything at work.

169
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,781
Did they respect the do not disturb?

170
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:11,443
No, they didn't, but Becky made sure they did.

171
00:09:11,703 --> 00:09:13,284
Becky would be like, he's a kid.

172
00:09:16,258 --> 00:09:20,740
Awesome colleague. So it ended up being respected. Okay. Yeah.

173
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,702
So it worked. Well, they respected Becky. Yes. You know,

174
00:09:24,722 --> 00:09:27,443
and I remember your office in at Microsoft, though, had was like

175
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,265
a glass booth. Oh, that was horrible. I didn't get any. But

176
00:09:30,305 --> 00:09:32,946
that was a different job. I wasn't doing creation in that

177
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,887
office ever. Right. Right. Yeah.

178
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:39,136
I had a glass booth where I did do creation at Danger, and the first thing I did was I

179
00:09:39,176 --> 00:09:43,137
put up Oralex foam across the window so people couldn't see what was happening.

180
00:09:43,277 --> 00:09:49,000
And this actually became a little bit of an issue in the office because people want, you

181
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,380
know, what's he doing in there?

182
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,641
What's going on there?

183
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:57,343
It became both more of a mystique, but also a little bit standoffish.

184
00:09:57,423 --> 00:10:00,324
Oh, he's got his thing, and, you know, he's that guy.

185
00:10:01,164 --> 00:10:03,925
Or as I usually call it, the pad itself, the lock on the inside.

186
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:12,262
Right. You know, also one other thing too is that I almost always get my best ideas when I'm walking my dog.

187
00:10:13,282 --> 00:10:22,187
It's like I'm out there, I'm in the thin, I'm not thinking about the work, and then I'll look at the trees, and I'll work up a sweat,

188
00:10:22,227 --> 00:10:27,050
and then some idea will come to me, and I'm like, oh, that's a good idea, and then I'll go home and I'll work.

189
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:31,784
On the subject of inspiration, one angle that I'm not sure has been touched on,

190
00:10:31,824 --> 00:10:36,146
but sometimes you can get inspiration from sources outside of audio.

191
00:10:36,286 --> 00:10:38,247
And if you can make friends with people in the art scene,

192
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:40,848
some of the best, quote unquote, best ideas that I've had

193
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:44,450
haven't come from audio people at all, but from designers and artists

194
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:47,611
and concept folks and making friends with them,

195
00:10:47,651 --> 00:10:49,932
which I know is not the easiest thing in the world to do,

196
00:10:49,952 --> 00:10:51,733
because usually it's like Audio Island out there

197
00:10:51,753 --> 00:10:53,974
where we're sequestered into our little corners.

198
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:55,315
But if you can make those connections...

199
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:59,277
they have brilliant insights and and you know they can they can

200
00:11:00,097 --> 00:11:03,598
offer a perspective that's sort of zoomed out you know we're so focused on

201
00:11:03,638 --> 00:11:04,539
our details and

202
00:11:04,979 --> 00:11:08,300
and if you're if you're in certain kinds of games like a cinematic title then

203
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,041
it's very easy to fall into the trap of thinking oh

204
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:14,463
it has to be so serious it has to be so dramatic you know whatever

205
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:18,064
and you forget that we're just making a game to sell to people for money

206
00:11:18,684 --> 00:11:20,205
and so it's it's good to it's good to

207
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:28,309
Just kind of interact with folks who are outside of that particular rat race and understand that you can take information from other sources.

208
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:31,290
The power of a liberal education.

209
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:39,154
Well, and that's the, but beyond that too, it's also a corporate setting does allow for that direct collaboration, creative collaboration.

210
00:11:39,174 --> 00:11:43,336
Like I, I was freelance for a while in the early 2000s.

211
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:49,620
And it was really hard to get adaptive scores done at that point in time

212
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,622
because he didn't support was challenging and there wasn't the weren't

213
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:58,165
the technical resources in order to do it not communication resources.

214
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:02,648
So I purposely went back in-house so I could affect change from within.

215
00:12:03,575 --> 00:12:05,716
Because there's certain creative changes I couldn't

216
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:08,837
do as a freelancer that I wanted to do, both at

217
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:10,618
Microsoft and PopCap, for example.

218
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:15,581
Now, between middleware and communication tools and

219
00:12:15,981 --> 00:12:18,903
culture changes, it's actually doable now.

220
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:22,524
I'm on a project where I'm checking in banks to Perforce

221
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,185
and we're communicating on Slack.

222
00:12:24,866 --> 00:12:26,787
And it's great.

223
00:12:26,807 --> 00:12:28,828
It's like the best of both worlds in a way.

224
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:31,029
I still have to reach out for personal communication.

225
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:33,447
It's really nice now.

226
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:37,471
Which is a great segue to our next topic, work.

227
00:12:39,773 --> 00:12:42,796
How does being a member of a team, rather than a hired gun,

228
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:46,540
help or hinder your workflow when producing game audio?

229
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:51,145
So like what Guy was saying, if you're in-house

230
00:12:51,185 --> 00:12:53,388
and you're a member of a team, and

231
00:12:54,923 --> 00:13:00,545
it seems to be a lot easier at times to be able to check things in and try it out and

232
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:06,928
play things for people and see how they react and also all the other stuff, the meetings

233
00:13:06,988 --> 00:13:12,110
and the reports and all the things you have to, emails, et cetera, and political battles

234
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:18,552
you have to fight. That can be a lot easier when you're in-house as a member of a team.

235
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:22,053
At the same time, when you're just a hired gun.

236
00:13:22,995 --> 00:13:29,396
You know, it used to be, like you say, nowadays it's getting a lot better, because you can do a lot of the stuff you used to have to only be able to do in-house.

237
00:13:30,016 --> 00:13:33,257
You know, like if you used to work at Sony, you had to use Scream and that was it.

238
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:37,498
And if you were outside, you couldn't use it. It was just not available.

239
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:40,019
But things have certainly gotten better now.

240
00:13:40,599 --> 00:13:47,601
But, you know, in the bad old days where, as a contractor, you make sound, you toss it over the wall.

241
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:52,148
that's it. A couple days later maybe you get a build and see if

242
00:13:52,168 --> 00:13:54,729
it got implemented correctly or not or if it still sounds the

243
00:13:54,749 --> 00:13:58,070
way you think it should. So there are advantages and

244
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:01,211
disadvantages to that, too, just for the workflow of how you

245
00:14:01,311 --> 00:14:01,952
produce the game.

246
00:14:04,747 --> 00:14:05,887
Yeah, I have a comment on that.

247
00:14:05,967 --> 00:14:08,928
Actually, not too long ago, working with Blizzard as a

248
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:12,449
contractor, and since they wouldn't let us run any part of

249
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:14,890
the game remotely, it was difficult.

250
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,771
And also, the audio lead had to go on a recording trip for

251
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:19,532
a couple weeks, but we couldn't stop working.

252
00:14:19,572 --> 00:14:20,813
And I asked the audio producer, you know,

253
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,235
maybe we should take a hiatus because we're going to be like

254
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,336
there were like five of us making sounds we're going to be

255
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:28,418
like sending a lot of sounds in that time. He's like, Oh, no,

256
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,799
it's fine. We're gonna have somebody else, you know, listen

257
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:34,122
to them instead. And he's like, got it, you know, approved to do

258
00:14:34,162 --> 00:14:37,324
that, make that those decisions. And of course, sure enough, he

259
00:14:37,364 --> 00:14:40,506
listened to everything green lighted a bunch of it. So that

260
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,768
was good. Got some fixes on some things, but mostly it was good.

261
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:47,010
Then the lead comes back. And of course, like he had a totally

262
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,672
different opinion on all these sounds. And I'm just like

263
00:14:49,872 --> 00:14:54,414
Oh, my God. We're so behind. So that was definitely a challenge

264
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:57,535
being a contractor in that way where we couldn't put anything

265
00:14:57,635 --> 00:15:00,036
in and test it and kind of make our own decisions. I think we

266
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:03,497
would have been better if we could have put our sounds in

267
00:15:03,517 --> 00:15:08,099
while the lead was away. But since we couldn't, it was tricky.

268
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,080
Now, Damian, you're like the pipeline guy.

269
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:16,482
Yeah, I guess I was going to propose, you know, is there any

270
00:15:16,622 --> 00:15:17,082
hindrance?

271
00:15:18,426 --> 00:15:21,429
to being in-house when it comes to workflow and tools?

272
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:23,971
Oh, I see.

273
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,572
Is there a negative to it?

274
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:28,435
Because I think the greatest negative to,

275
00:15:28,455 --> 00:15:32,298
or the greatest impact to workflow and tools pipeline

276
00:15:32,338 --> 00:15:35,121
is actually being out of house.

277
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:39,224
Whereas if you're in-house, you have all the toys.

278
00:15:39,985 --> 00:15:45,786
So it doesn't really, being in-house doesn't affect your workflow and tools in that you have them.

279
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:52,008
Well, yeah, I mean, this is probably what you're about to say, but in terms of things that are connecting to the game, absolutely.

280
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:54,269
The tools are right there if you have a problem.

281
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:59,810
IT is right there, and all the other people who maybe made the tool are right there in the building.

282
00:16:00,331 --> 00:16:00,971
But, um...

283
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:07,294
I suppose one aspect that you might not have as much control over is your own software.

284
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:11,236
I mean, you might join a studio where they're just, we are a Pro Tools studio and that's

285
00:16:11,316 --> 00:16:11,416
it.

286
00:16:11,516 --> 00:16:13,397
Or we are a Logic studio and that's what you get.

287
00:16:13,737 --> 00:16:18,139
Whereas if you're at home, you have the flexibility of picking whatever DAW you want, whatever

288
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:23,622
sample libraries and from that production end, you have a little more freedom.

289
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:28,665
And also when you want to do, I don't know, it's interesting.

290
00:16:29,476 --> 00:16:37,123
if there's some kind of tool or pipeline process that you want to do, it's somehow, if I'm just

291
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:43,548
independent, I'm just doing it this way, done. Whereas when I'm in-house, I have to...

292
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,443
you know, not only do the job, but sell the job to the people I'm doing it for,

293
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:53,684
and then once the job is done, explain to them how it was done that way.

294
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:58,927
And there's a whole process for getting your work approved.

295
00:16:59,387 --> 00:17:01,128
Yeah, there's the overhead you're dealing with.

296
00:17:01,148 --> 00:17:01,988
There's a lot of overhead.

297
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:04,530
Well, the other thing that I was...

298
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,591
When Karen was talking about working with Blizzard...

299
00:17:07,183 --> 00:17:11,265
That was, in a lot of cases, they're not alone,

300
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,165
still majority, particularly larger companies,

301
00:17:13,185 --> 00:17:15,066
there's a cultural resistance to working

302
00:17:15,506 --> 00:17:17,547
and allowing access to builds.

303
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:20,048
You know, and that's understandable.

304
00:17:20,068 --> 00:17:23,109
A lot of them get released inappropriately,

305
00:17:23,149 --> 00:17:24,790
even with VPN and stuff like that.

306
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:26,971
So you find middle and smaller companies

307
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:28,712
more willing to open up their pipelines,

308
00:17:28,732 --> 00:17:31,353
which makes you closer to the team as an independent

309
00:17:31,933 --> 00:17:33,634
and able to do a lot of this stuff.

310
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,144
There's the other side of that as well, because right now I am doing a Wwise implementation.

311
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:45,989
I do not have access, there's no VPN, there's no, I don't do Perforce, we use Git so it's

312
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:46,289
open.

313
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,793
There's a lot of, there are a number, you know, I can't file bugs, I've got to tell

314
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:54,275
the guy, hey, this is not working, blah, blah, blah.

315
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:55,196
No JIRA, etc.

316
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:57,078
This is where we are right now, but there could be.

317
00:17:58,356 --> 00:18:08,263
It could be and it has been in the past, but in this particular case, I'm not allowed to do that and that's a little bit of a hindrance of being an indie as opposed to being in a team.

318
00:18:08,664 --> 00:18:15,509
It seems like it's up to the game developers really. It varies so wildly across studios. Some of them are very open to...

319
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:22,071
I mean, when I was working on Lara Croft, they literally just gave me a PC and I could

320
00:18:22,091 --> 00:18:24,152
just implement however, you know, all willy nilly.

321
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:28,113
I could play a level, decide that I'm not smart enough to fix this puzzle and then just

322
00:18:28,193 --> 00:18:31,454
implement a new music cue for people like me who take forever to solve it.

323
00:18:31,854 --> 00:18:32,554
And I could just do that.

324
00:18:32,614 --> 00:18:34,375
And then it's in the game and there we go.

325
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:35,835
But then there's other cases where...

326
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:41,640
Sometimes for secrecy reasons sometimes for technical reasons. I just don't have any access to the game at all

327
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,103
I never played Star Wars the Old Republic ever. I've never played the game despite writing

328
00:18:46,744 --> 00:18:50,507
Played a score. Yeah. Yeah, because there was just no way to

329
00:18:50,647 --> 00:18:54,370
Send it out to us. And so we just had to go off of concept art and

330
00:18:55,471 --> 00:19:00,996
Some lore documents and that's it. So it just what it's just wildly varies, but I mean to Damien's point

331
00:19:01,616 --> 00:19:06,900
being in-house means that you probably have the best situation in terms of workflow overhaul.

332
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:12,244
Now, don't you guys all think that it's improved over the last, even five years?

333
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:18,449
Oh yeah. The first seven years of my career I was a freelancer working specifically

334
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:23,353
between content and the game as a technical sound designer. Right?

335
00:19:23,653 --> 00:19:28,897
So I lived in middleware tools, whether they were off the shelf or proprietary.

336
00:19:28,957 --> 00:19:30,118
This was my jam, right?

337
00:19:30,884 --> 00:19:36,549
and I did it remotely as a preference and I was able to be

338
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:40,232
very effective when given the resources that I needed like

339
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:46,218
access to the build, access to the tools, access to a

340
00:19:46,298 --> 00:19:49,761
development platform. These were things that I could

341
00:19:49,961 --> 00:19:51,642
absolutely do. Now, that

342
00:19:55,598 --> 00:20:00,722
became very interesting for me after a time because while I did feel very effective and

343
00:20:00,762 --> 00:20:09,269
very able to from the remote perspective do my job, it became increasingly more important

344
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:14,753
to a developer towards the end of their production to actually have me physically on site. And

345
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:20,598
so I then ended up spending, you know, months at a time servicing a developer on site.

346
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:26,122
to be closer to the tools, to be closer to the team, and to be closer to the changes

347
00:20:26,202 --> 00:20:32,186
that were rapidly emerging towards finaling a game. And so you had this like almost race

348
00:20:32,206 --> 00:20:39,752
to the finish line where, sure, working remotely was, I was highly effective and highly capable

349
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:48,038
and highly enabled for a period of time, but in the rapid acceleration towards, you know,

350
00:20:48,078 --> 00:20:49,999
finishing the game, that just wasn't enough.

351
00:20:51,623 --> 00:20:58,002
Yeah. Cool. Okay, let's move on to the next topic. Another easy

352
00:20:58,103 --> 00:20:59,066
one. Money.

353
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:06,264
strategies for maintaining studio gear on an indie rather than a corporate budget. Now,

354
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:11,130
one of the things I mean by this one is, and I was talking about this earlier, not here

355
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:17,036
but with some folks, is this idea that whenever I start a new project, I always make, or even

356
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:22,021
when I'm building a studio for whatever purpose, I always build a studio for the purpose of

357
00:21:22,061 --> 00:21:23,203
the project I'm working on.

358
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:29,144
So, and even when I start a new project, if I don't have to build a whole new studio around it,

359
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:34,265
then I always, always buy a new toy or a new plug-in or a new synthesizer or something,

360
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,566
just so I can have some fun playing with these things,

361
00:21:37,906 --> 00:21:43,167
and I feel, I hope that that kind of fun translates into the work.

362
00:21:43,587 --> 00:21:47,768
But it's always geared toward, the gear is geared towards...

363
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,469
a specific purpose, a specific project that I'm doing.

364
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:53,809
So right now I'm doing a mobile game.

365
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,371
My Pro Tools rig, Florida killed it.

366
00:21:59,331 --> 00:22:00,651
And so I had to build a new system

367
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:01,912
when I got back to California.

368
00:22:02,932 --> 00:22:05,293
And so for that, I'm doing a mobile game.

369
00:22:05,353 --> 00:22:06,813
I have no need for a surround system.

370
00:22:06,913 --> 00:22:08,274
I got no need for subwoofers.

371
00:22:08,314 --> 00:22:09,094
I got nothing.

372
00:22:09,294 --> 00:22:09,914
So I don't have them.

373
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,595
I got two really big, nice Genelecs.

374
00:22:11,995 --> 00:22:16,178
But that's all I really need for a mobile game.

375
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:18,800
Whereas if someone wanted to hire me to do work on a

376
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,082
surround sound system, then I'd go and buy a surround

377
00:22:22,323 --> 00:22:23,864
mixer and a bunch more speakers.

378
00:22:26,786 --> 00:22:29,928
Whereas when I'm building a studio in a corporate

379
00:22:29,988 --> 00:22:33,651
environment, you kind of want to think about all the

380
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:37,153
possible things you might want to do in a corporate setting

381
00:22:37,453 --> 00:22:38,594
and then build for that.

382
00:22:39,074 --> 00:22:41,296
So like at Magically, if I built a system, and again,

383
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,870
magic leap device, where you wear it on your head, there's no surround system, there's no

384
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,291
subwoofer, so I just had a couple of big gentle legs and that was great for what I was using

385
00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:53,633
for. Whereas in other situations like a danger I had, there was a bunch of different things

386
00:22:53,653 --> 00:22:58,515
that I had to do with it, and so we had a bunch of different systems and I had like four or five

387
00:22:58,555 --> 00:23:03,977
computers in a row in my office in those days for doing specific things for different parts of

388
00:23:04,077 --> 00:23:09,339
the product as it was being made. So how do you guys feel about, you know, building your own

389
00:23:09,379 --> 00:23:11,680
studio versus building your studio on a corporate budget?

390
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:14,660
You don't actually have a studio.

391
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,641
Where's the guitar pedals?

392
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:27,950
Not to sort of self advertise or whatever, but in 2016 I did a GDC talk about, I think it was just called like triple A virtual orchestration on an indie budget.

393
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:35,415
And I went over a bunch of different strategies for basically how to stretch a small amount of dollars as far as humanly possible.

394
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:40,199
Things like how to work with live soloists in the most effective ways and so on and so forth.

395
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,280
But...

396
00:23:42,197 --> 00:23:51,950
Along with that, one recommendation I can give, especially towards people who are doing more kind of dramatic music or orchestral music or whatever, is only by...

397
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:55,606
sample libraries that are basically the best.

398
00:23:56,307 --> 00:23:58,129
If there's a decision between like,

399
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,911
oh, there's this library and I really love it

400
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:01,672
and its sound is gonna work so well

401
00:24:01,752 --> 00:24:03,494
for whatever I'm working on,

402
00:24:03,874 --> 00:24:05,456
but then there's this one that's cheaper,

403
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:06,397
don't get the cheap one.

404
00:24:06,437 --> 00:24:08,459
Just wait until you can afford that.

405
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:11,262
First off, sample library prices often come down,

406
00:24:11,642 --> 00:24:14,224
unless it's Spectrosonics, but that's another conversation.

407
00:24:14,842 --> 00:24:19,584
They often come down, and so if you can just hold off a little bit and only buy the ones

408
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:24,365
that really fit for your, you know, what you have in mind for what you're doing, you'll

409
00:24:24,385 --> 00:24:25,426
save money in the long run.

410
00:24:25,566 --> 00:24:26,346
Fewer but awesome.

411
00:24:26,446 --> 00:24:27,147
Yeah, exactly.

412
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:27,707
Fewer but awesome.

413
00:24:27,807 --> 00:24:28,327
Absolutely.

414
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:28,787
Absolutely.

415
00:24:28,887 --> 00:24:29,968
That's true of all gear, actually.

416
00:24:29,988 --> 00:24:30,468
It's true.

417
00:24:30,728 --> 00:24:34,469
I'm kind of, we all go these phases of gear, right?

418
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:39,852
No matter what we're doing, because gear evolves, right, along with us, the technology, so I'm

419
00:24:39,872 --> 00:24:40,992
in that phase.

420
00:24:41,572 --> 00:24:42,453
And my motto is...

421
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:46,188
fewer more awesome pieces of gear.

422
00:24:46,428 --> 00:24:48,689
You know, my studio's actually kind of doing this

423
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,271
in some ways and doing this in others.

424
00:24:53,172 --> 00:24:54,732
My home studio's always been more capable

425
00:24:54,772 --> 00:24:56,513
than the corporate studio I've ever worked in,

426
00:24:56,813 --> 00:24:58,474
you know, except for like the studio,

427
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,016
not my office, like at Microsoft or something.

428
00:25:01,636 --> 00:25:02,636
And that's the exception.

429
00:25:02,856 --> 00:25:06,818
But my home rig has always had more samples

430
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:10,520
and I've often done work at home for work

431
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,281
at the corporate side.

432
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:17,512
But as an Indy, it's an actual direct investment in what you're doing.

433
00:25:17,572 --> 00:25:19,213
It's tax write-off.

434
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:19,954
It's all of that.

435
00:25:20,034 --> 00:25:27,199
So, yeah, it's harder, but I think I invest more while I'm an Indy for sure.

436
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:28,920
You invest more as an Indy.

437
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:29,761
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

438
00:25:29,781 --> 00:25:30,601
Yeah.

439
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,883
I want to underline tax write-off.

440
00:25:33,546 --> 00:25:34,466
Well, there's that as well.

441
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:41,808
While I'm not a tax attorney by any stretch, I think we all know that there are opportunities

442
00:25:42,568 --> 00:25:47,590
to maximize equipment for self-employed purchases.

443
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:52,711
Well, and I'll even go farther than that, in that the only way I've been able to afford

444
00:25:52,731 --> 00:25:57,072
the studios that I have had when I've had a corporate gig...

445
00:25:57,992 --> 00:25:59,932
is by running the studio.

446
00:25:59,952 --> 00:26:01,833
So it's like I have a corporate gig,

447
00:26:01,873 --> 00:26:03,094
I'm making a bunch of money,

448
00:26:03,154 --> 00:26:05,655
and the government takes like that much.

449
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:09,056
But then as a side project, I'll do like a little project,

450
00:26:09,356 --> 00:26:10,837
and then I'll spend a bunch of money on gear.

451
00:26:11,717 --> 00:26:14,438
And then that amount of money

452
00:26:14,938 --> 00:26:16,579
comes off of my corporate taxes,

453
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:19,100
and so I get more of it back than I would have otherwise.

454
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,321
That way the government is actually paying for my gear

455
00:26:22,462 --> 00:26:24,582
on a regular basis over time.

456
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:26,843
And that's worked for me rather well.

457
00:26:27,577 --> 00:26:31,933
Now, it's different when your income is only in the...

458
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:36,554
you have to do other tricks, that one doesn't quite work.

459
00:26:36,934 --> 00:26:39,655
And I'm not sure, I've been doing that for a long time,

460
00:26:40,255 --> 00:26:41,936
but there's years when I'm indie,

461
00:26:41,956 --> 00:26:43,456
and there's years when I'm doing the corporate,

462
00:26:43,716 --> 00:26:44,437
running the thing off.

463
00:26:44,917 --> 00:26:47,158
I don't know if I were to do that every year,

464
00:26:47,198 --> 00:26:48,318
for like 20 years in a row,

465
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:49,718
the IRS might come after my ass.

466
00:26:49,778 --> 00:26:49,959
But-

467
00:26:50,019 --> 00:26:51,659
Yeah, business has to make money, actually,

468
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:52,840
after a certain amount.

469
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,200
After a certain amount, you have to make money.

470
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,481
And usually by that time I'm indie again anyway,

471
00:26:56,501 --> 00:26:58,001
so the only income I've got is video.

472
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:05,045
But, yeah, the studio investment is one part of this whole money thing.

473
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:07,107
Obviously, it's the investment piece.

474
00:27:07,147 --> 00:27:11,632
But Karen and I were talking yesterday about the extra costs of being independent.

475
00:27:11,693 --> 00:27:13,375
And I don't know. We're all independent now.

476
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:17,479
And I just had to buy insurance for my whole family, health insurance.

477
00:27:18,455 --> 00:27:20,236
uh... and that was an eye opener

478
00:27:20,256 --> 00:27:24,378
uh... hesitate to say the price tag but it's it's wild

479
00:27:24,658 --> 00:27:26,119
what for a family of three

480
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:29,961
uh... what health insurance is and it's not as good as health insurance as they had at

481
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,301
microsoft by a long shot

482
00:27:32,862 --> 00:27:33,582
so in the u.s.

483
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:37,164
in the u.s. exactly in the u.s. and and that's a... well everybody else that's part of your...

484
00:27:37,404 --> 00:27:38,845
so it's a hindrance it's a weight

485
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:43,207
on the on the independent community that is actually very real and I think it's going to be

486
00:27:43,227 --> 00:27:45,288
it's going to be real for all americans at some point but

487
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:54,024
It's in it. I know for a fact that that weighs on people's decisions whether to go indie or not in a negative sense

488
00:27:54,265 --> 00:27:56,970
Right. No, absolutely. It's certainly more

489
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,640
expensive to be in the but also can be more rewarding in its

490
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,761
and last times effort you know I was I was thinking about starting off this

491
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:07,622
a session with the line is

492
00:28:07,822 --> 00:28:11,183
in the just another word employed because

493
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:14,564
certainly in my case yeah you know there have been times that I've been working

494
00:28:14,604 --> 00:28:15,344
anything and then

495
00:28:15,364 --> 00:28:18,185
I got reordered out or it was just time to go

496
00:28:18,605 --> 00:28:21,406
and like it was like I had anything to go to so

497
00:28:21,526 --> 00:28:25,146
well guess I'm in back to be in India yet so it's interesting that way

498
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:27,575
I was just going to add one thing.

499
00:28:28,276 --> 00:28:31,238
One of the strategies I employ, since so much of my income

500
00:28:31,258 --> 00:28:35,060
does go to medical insurance, is I

501
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,522
will see what I need for that particular project

502
00:28:37,642 --> 00:28:40,304
and then buy accordingly a lot of times.

503
00:28:40,664 --> 00:28:43,106
And then, of course, use that for tax write-offs as well.

504
00:28:43,586 --> 00:28:46,248
And then look at where I'm at in the middle of the year,

505
00:28:46,288 --> 00:28:48,229
like August, do I have to spend more money?

506
00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:49,870
And if I do, I buy more equipment.

507
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,791
And then again in November, December,

508
00:28:51,851 --> 00:28:54,393
especially Black Friday, all the plug-in sales.

509
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:54,793
That's right.

510
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,274
what can I buy at half off or whatever?

511
00:28:57,835 --> 00:28:59,976
And so I do that and that helps.

512
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:04,297
Or you can also share with other indies sometimes,

513
00:29:04,337 --> 00:29:06,338
like sound library, well we're not supposed to do it,

514
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:07,899
but everybody does it.

515
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:11,420
Trade sounds and maybe borrow a microphone

516
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,481
instead of buying it if you're not gonna use it a lot

517
00:29:13,521 --> 00:29:14,722
and that kind of stuff helps too.

518
00:29:16,502 --> 00:29:16,783
Cool.

519
00:29:18,203 --> 00:29:19,944
Next big topic, power.

520
00:29:22,365 --> 00:29:27,246
Advantages and disadvantages of being an employee or a contractor when managing office politics.

521
00:29:27,326 --> 00:29:34,649
Now, we all know that politics and selling your job and telling people what you're doing

522
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:40,111
and convincing them to buy in on it is at least 50% of the job, if not more.

523
00:29:40,131 --> 00:29:44,773
A lot of times I say, you know, doing the job is only half of it.

524
00:29:44,813 --> 00:29:48,494
It's like everything else is part of it, even when you're an employee or a contractor.

525
00:29:49,395 --> 00:29:53,799
But if you're a contractor, you tend to be able to sidestep a

526
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:54,419
lot of stuff.

527
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:56,081
You also don't have to go to so many meetings.

528
00:29:56,681 --> 00:30:00,324
And even when you do go to meetings, a lot of times you're

529
00:30:00,344 --> 00:30:03,666
on Google video chat.

530
00:30:04,187 --> 00:30:06,168
And so you can kind of put that there.

531
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:08,710
And you can just mute your device.

532
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,011
And you can go do all your other stuff.

533
00:30:10,051 --> 00:30:11,713
And you can continue doing stuff.

534
00:30:12,113 --> 00:30:15,756
But if you're in the room, you have to be part of the thing,

535
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:16,897
even when you don't agree with what's

536
00:30:16,917 --> 00:30:18,018
happening or whatever.

537
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:18,718
It can be.

538
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:25,143
a little more, the problem has become more important, I think, when you're in-house and

539
00:30:25,163 --> 00:30:27,765
when you're an employee or when you're a contractor.

540
00:30:28,766 --> 00:30:29,066
Agree?

541
00:30:29,106 --> 00:30:29,426
Disagree?

542
00:30:31,468 --> 00:30:36,189
Yeah, I mean, like, I think it's important to make sure that you're as close as possible

543
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,650
to whoever your representative is.

544
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:42,432
Maybe it's the audio director, maybe it's a music supervisor, but try to be not only

545
00:30:42,472 --> 00:30:46,573
close professionally, but in, you know, almost like a personal level so that they're really

546
00:30:46,633 --> 00:30:47,193
fighting for you.

547
00:30:48,094 --> 00:30:51,495
Because it is a struggle, you know, everyone has their opinions, especially with something

548
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:51,955
like music.

549
00:30:53,897 --> 00:30:59,502
One example actually, I was the composer and music supervisor for a game called Star Wars First Assault.

550
00:31:00,263 --> 00:31:05,007
And for that one, we budgeted, it was a 75 minute score.

551
00:31:05,027 --> 00:31:08,190
And I looked at the game and I realized this is multiplayer only.

552
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:13,335
And we wanted to have a feel and a vibe and a story to it, but there's no single player.

553
00:31:13,976 --> 00:31:17,638
So I basically said, all right, well, 15 minutes of the music

554
00:31:17,698 --> 00:31:22,440
will be just main themes, just things for the opening menu

555
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,080
and just a whole playlist of that.

556
00:31:24,601 --> 00:31:26,241
I don't think I ever would have gotten away with that

557
00:31:26,562 --> 00:31:28,242
if I were out of house.

558
00:31:28,663 --> 00:31:28,843
Right.

559
00:31:29,443 --> 00:31:31,365
Number one, it was me making the decisions.

560
00:31:31,425 --> 00:31:33,407
I could do almost whatever the hell I want.

561
00:31:33,827 --> 00:31:38,891
Also, it was easy to just put it in the game before it's live recorded,

562
00:31:39,332 --> 00:31:40,593
before it cost anyone anything.

563
00:31:40,973 --> 00:31:45,698
Put it in, show people where my mind was at, and get their buy-in on it.

564
00:31:47,379 --> 00:31:48,040
You've done that a bunch.

565
00:31:49,912 --> 00:31:56,197
One of the, again, another huge advantage and why I have gone in-house so that I could

566
00:31:56,217 --> 00:31:58,179
get, I mentioned earlier, leverage.

567
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,903
You say the word power, but it's more about that leverage and being that advocate inside

568
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:04,964
the corporation.

569
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:07,866
That has to exist no matter whether you're out or in.

570
00:32:09,088 --> 00:32:11,791
If you're a freelancer, you know the person who has that leverage.

571
00:32:11,811 --> 00:32:17,359
You're working with an audio director, hopefully, who has, as an independent, who has that upstream

572
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,124
know-how of the corporate environment and can get the buy-in for audio.

573
00:32:21,922 --> 00:32:28,106
you know, I got good at that and that was to my advantage and I was able to, you know,

574
00:32:28,126 --> 00:32:31,408
allow creative people, including myself, to do creative things.

575
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:38,152
So that's its own thing and you can only do that really from within, so to the nth degree

576
00:32:38,172 --> 00:32:38,513
at least.

577
00:32:39,113 --> 00:32:45,877
Well, and what you get when you sign up for that in-house is a myriad of things that

578
00:32:47,062 --> 00:32:51,042
mean nothing to someone outside the fence.

579
00:32:51,582 --> 00:32:54,083
So you don't have an investment in the company

580
00:32:54,123 --> 00:32:56,123
and their success or failure so much.

581
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:59,304
You definitely have a commitment to the product

582
00:32:59,384 --> 00:33:02,804
and your contribution and its success,

583
00:33:03,364 --> 00:33:05,205
but you're not rounding up at the company meeting

584
00:33:05,245 --> 00:33:08,805
to hear financial reports about how the company's doing.

585
00:33:09,265 --> 00:33:12,126
And that's not woven into the fabric of every conversation

586
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:15,227
with every coworker that you have about the,

587
00:33:16,421 --> 00:33:18,883
morale or temperature necessary

588
00:33:19,384 --> 00:33:24,688
Necessarily on a daily basis right and so when you're outside the fence you're like

589
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:33,796
Rock I can do this all and you don't have to deflect the political business that goes on in-house

590
00:33:34,617 --> 00:33:37,680
with with good cover good leadership in the in-house the

591
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,172
The freelance folks can really be streamlined and efficient.

592
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:44,613
And that's key to a good pipeline.

593
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:49,836
I don't want to embarrass you, but I lived in awe of Guy when

594
00:33:49,856 --> 00:33:52,517
I was working at Microsoft, because he got shit done.

595
00:33:52,537 --> 00:33:55,539
And I couldn't, personally in my own group, I couldn't get

596
00:33:55,739 --> 00:33:56,299
anything done.

597
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,920
I couldn't get anybody to listen to a damn word I was

598
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,221
saying, it was very frustrating.

599
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:03,543
But you started an initiative about plug-in initiatives.

600
00:34:03,663 --> 00:34:04,363
Yeah, DSPs, yeah.

601
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:08,128
I was in the buy and boom, boom, boom.

602
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:09,791
I'm like, how did you do that?

603
00:34:09,811 --> 00:34:10,311
Oh my God.

604
00:34:10,331 --> 00:34:10,933
Let me add one more thing.

605
00:34:10,953 --> 00:34:11,634
Guy is a manager.

606
00:34:15,017 --> 00:34:19,981
deflected political bullshit for the team that wasn't important.

607
00:34:20,381 --> 00:34:27,827
And so he was the shit shield that basically deflected things that were really not a concern

608
00:34:27,887 --> 00:34:29,508
on a daily basis, right?

609
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:35,673
He was a good filter, but also, you know, a transparent communicator of things that

610
00:34:36,013 --> 00:34:36,713
would have an effect.

611
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:42,914
Right. That person, whoever it is, has to have the best creative goals of the game and the company in mind.

612
00:34:43,555 --> 00:34:50,700
And that's the key role of any audio director, particularly at a sizable developer or publisher.

613
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:54,803
You know, one thing you were talking about, though, about dealing with different audio people,

614
00:34:55,764 --> 00:35:00,568
you know, for me, a lot of times I've been the only audio guy there.

615
00:35:00,668 --> 00:35:05,732
The people I'm dealing with are managers and engineers and other people who don't really understand audio at all.

616
00:35:06,055 --> 00:35:12,160
And the political battle tends to be, believe me, I know what I'm talking about and trying

617
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,563
to sell the idea of yes, this is the way we want to do it.

618
00:35:17,025 --> 00:35:21,529
Even if it's at odds with, well, that means the engineer has to do a bunch of stuff and

619
00:35:21,549 --> 00:35:23,731
I'll have to set my schedule and I'll have time for blah, blah, blah.

620
00:35:24,011 --> 00:35:26,233
And dealing with those kinds of political issues.

621
00:35:28,129 --> 00:35:30,951
Again, it's much, it's doable in-house.

622
00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:34,173
As a contractor, you can't reassign the engineers.

623
00:35:34,854 --> 00:35:36,315
Here, you need to do this for me,

624
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:37,416
and it's gonna take you a week,

625
00:35:37,496 --> 00:35:40,518
and, you know, as a contractor, you can't do that.

626
00:35:40,758 --> 00:35:42,760
But as in-house, you can go to that guy's manager,

627
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,541
you can go to your manager, you can go to his manager,

628
00:35:44,941 --> 00:35:46,302
et cetera, et cetera, to get things done.

629
00:35:47,003 --> 00:35:48,864
You know, Karen, you and I were also talking

630
00:35:48,924 --> 00:35:50,605
about the different shades of corporate.

631
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:52,067
This is kind of where this comes in,

632
00:35:53,347 --> 00:35:55,289
where I'm hoping.

633
00:35:55,927 --> 00:36:00,228
that more and more as an independence, we can do more of that.

634
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:02,248
You know, have more of this creative state.

635
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:09,690
As teams become more pick up ball games to get a game done, it looks a little more like

636
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:13,311
a, I hate to say it, but more of like how a movie gets done.

637
00:36:13,331 --> 00:36:15,412
And there might be more of that.

638
00:36:15,432 --> 00:36:21,673
And in that case, there might be less bifurcation between corporate and, but the indie might

639
00:36:21,693 --> 00:36:22,893
be able to have more input in.

640
00:36:24,526 --> 00:36:26,327
technical say for example.

641
00:36:27,028 --> 00:36:28,669
Right, like a virtual audio department?

642
00:36:28,689 --> 00:36:28,910
Yeah.

643
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:31,352
As it builds with smaller teams,

644
00:36:31,532 --> 00:36:33,734
multiple contractors working together

645
00:36:33,834 --> 00:36:35,495
with like a developer possibly.

646
00:36:35,655 --> 00:36:37,397
The more they let us into their code base

647
00:36:37,577 --> 00:36:40,519
to do stuff in Unreal and Unity at that level

648
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,961
and script in there.

649
00:36:42,481 --> 00:36:45,123
We're working by the week or by the day or by the hour

650
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:46,905
and that's a different ball game.

651
00:36:48,891 --> 00:36:51,013
Yeah, I think the model of, you know, the contractors out of

652
00:36:51,133 --> 00:36:54,675
house and all they're, you know, not here, and we don't need to

653
00:36:54,715 --> 00:36:57,758
tell them that it's starting to go away, thank goodness. Because

654
00:36:57,778 --> 00:37:00,360
so many times I've had to fight to find things out that I'm

655
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,662
like, well, what, we don't have the latest animations like you

656
00:37:03,682 --> 00:37:06,484
did, you know what, this changed a week ago, we didn't get them.

657
00:37:06,584 --> 00:37:09,507
Like, yeah, I'm often the one that's doing the tracking for

658
00:37:09,807 --> 00:37:12,909
the client, I find, and I was like, well, I shouldn't be

659
00:37:12,949 --> 00:37:16,031
doing this. But I do it because I'm protecting myself and the

660
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:18,453
deadlines and my deliveries, and I want them to be happy.

661
00:37:19,707 --> 00:37:21,608
But those are services now we can offer.

662
00:37:21,848 --> 00:37:22,508
That is true.

663
00:37:22,528 --> 00:37:24,389
So we should start turn that around.

664
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:24,870
Right.

665
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:29,352
And as independents and say, well, we have a little fee for that.

666
00:37:29,772 --> 00:37:29,952
Yes.

667
00:37:30,273 --> 00:37:31,113
I'm your producer.

668
00:37:31,373 --> 00:37:32,594
Yeah, I caught your producer.

669
00:37:32,674 --> 00:37:33,574
Uh-huh.

670
00:37:35,015 --> 00:37:35,275
Cool.

671
00:37:35,496 --> 00:37:35,796
OK.

672
00:37:37,317 --> 00:37:39,638
Final topic, hashtag game audio.

673
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:43,900
Ways you can contribute to the game audio community as an employee

674
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,081
and as a contractor.

675
00:37:45,621 --> 00:37:48,243
Damian here is the game audio community in some ways.

676
00:37:48,853 --> 00:37:56,115
And the hashtag Game Audio or hashtag Game Audio GDC is a way that we can communicate

677
00:37:56,135 --> 00:37:59,976
about issues in the industry and what's going on.

678
00:38:02,017 --> 00:38:06,258
How does being in-house or a contractor help or hinder that process?

679
00:38:06,278 --> 00:38:07,478
Because you've been both.

680
00:38:08,437 --> 00:38:25,102
Yeah, I mean, I guess it ultimately comes down to that little disclaimer that people put into their profiles that says something to the effect that these are my personal views and do not represent those of my employer.

681
00:38:26,582 --> 00:38:30,084
When you are your own employer, you don't need that disclaimer, right?

682
00:38:30,984 --> 00:38:32,304
Otherwise, you are...

683
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:42,756
you have a heightened awareness of what is appropriate for you to share and there's just

684
00:38:42,796 --> 00:38:48,219
a little more focus on that. So that's the first thing I can think of.

685
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:54,782
I think there is a difference on some levels. Not in terms of participation, in fact there's

686
00:38:54,842 --> 00:38:57,904
strengths and weaknesses, but that for certain.

687
00:38:58,947 --> 00:39:03,491
When you're with a corporation, whether they're, and every place I've been has been very open

688
00:39:03,511 --> 00:39:06,854
about letting me speak, letting me blog, even in creative projects.

689
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:10,077
But you're still wearing that hat when you come out.

690
00:39:10,218 --> 00:39:16,584
So when I was at Microsoft, I was a little bit cautious about behavior and things I say

691
00:39:16,644 --> 00:39:19,306
just because I'm representing a large corporation.

692
00:39:20,928 --> 00:39:22,249
And now I can go, yay.

693
00:39:22,747 --> 00:39:23,267
and do anything.

694
00:39:24,587 --> 00:39:26,928
But the advantage, though, is you represent a big

695
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,409
corporation, and you can actually push initiatives and

696
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:31,310
carry a little bit of sway with certain things.

697
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:34,332
So there's good on both sides.

698
00:39:35,092 --> 00:39:37,853
I'm going to tell one, I hope I don't embarrass you, Guy

699
00:39:37,893 --> 00:39:42,475
Whitmore story, where when I was an independent, and I used

700
00:39:42,495 --> 00:39:45,296
to write this thing called the Annoying Audio Blog, which was

701
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:49,938
a series of articles designed to be kind of about as

702
00:39:50,018 --> 00:39:52,219
outrageous as possible about audio topics.

703
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:57,449
and I had gone to a conference and listened to a bunch of the new games that were out

704
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:03,776
and I wrote this rant about why is it that we have these humongous machines with hundreds

705
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:09,382
of tracks and all the games still sound like 1950s gladiator music and the same Sturm und

706
00:40:09,422 --> 00:40:11,205
Drang and full choir I've always heard.

707
00:40:12,398 --> 00:40:15,180
And I published this, and it caused a little bit of a stir.

708
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,442
At one point, I think actually at the barbecue, a guy took me

709
00:40:18,462 --> 00:40:19,822
aside and goes, you know that thing you wrote?

710
00:40:20,623 --> 00:40:23,184
I'm glad you said that, because I can't say that.

711
00:40:24,285 --> 00:40:25,045
When he was at Microsoft.

712
00:40:26,726 --> 00:40:31,169
But I don't think being in-house or freelance, as far

713
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:36,092
as community participation goes, maybe in a soft

714
00:40:36,172 --> 00:40:38,973
environment, not necessarily the hard black and white of

715
00:40:39,053 --> 00:40:40,434
the online experience.

716
00:40:41,958 --> 00:40:50,674
I don't feel like having bounced across those barriers in the past years has really changed

717
00:40:50,694 --> 00:40:53,879
the way that I approach community from a grassroots level.

718
00:40:55,627 --> 00:40:57,688
And if anything, like you mentioned there,

719
00:40:58,069 --> 00:41:01,812
there's a even greater responsibility and or power

720
00:41:01,852 --> 00:41:04,434
that comes from having a position in-house

721
00:41:04,934 --> 00:41:09,338
that you can maybe leverage towards, you know,

722
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:16,483
space or food budget or, you know,

723
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:22,188
connections with other studios, you know,

724
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:24,570
towards trying to bring community together.

725
00:41:25,242 --> 00:41:30,685
And so at the same time, when you're freelance, wow, you

726
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:37,109
might have more time to really pull together things and bring

727
00:41:37,169 --> 00:41:40,211
a more diverse experience to whatever community you're

728
00:41:40,231 --> 00:41:41,531
participating in.

729
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:45,273
And so you have a little bit of a balance there between those.

730
00:41:45,871 --> 00:41:50,414
Yeah, one thing that Damian and I were talking about kind of offline was that when you're

731
00:41:50,654 --> 00:41:55,938
freelance there's certainly a lot of benefits to being very active in the greater game audio

732
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:56,518
community.

733
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:57,279
Right.

734
00:41:57,419 --> 00:42:01,622
Whereas when you're in-house, you're collecting a check no matter what, there's a danger of

735
00:42:01,662 --> 00:42:02,523
becoming comfortable.

736
00:42:02,923 --> 00:42:03,743
Yes.

737
00:42:03,803 --> 00:42:04,744
I'm glad you brought that up.

738
00:42:04,784 --> 00:42:08,687
Yeah, you, well, I mean, you guys can expand on this, but basically the idea is that, you

739
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:12,329
know, you have your job, you do your job well, you'll keep your job, hopefully.

740
00:42:12,349 --> 00:42:13,050
Thanks.

741
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,272
you know, why not go home?

742
00:42:15,652 --> 00:42:20,136
And why go to the extra effort of, you know,

743
00:42:20,176 --> 00:42:22,678
throwing events and participating in the community?

744
00:42:22,718 --> 00:42:23,919
And it's valid.

745
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,124
But my take on it is that you have more potential,

746
00:42:29,664 --> 00:42:32,126
in my opinion, you know, you have a little bit more power.

747
00:42:32,486 --> 00:42:34,108
I wouldn't necessarily say responsibility

748
00:42:34,128 --> 00:42:35,629
because it's not for everyone, and I understand,

749
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:37,911
but when you are connected to a company,

750
00:42:38,632 --> 00:42:43,535
There's more opportunities for you to give back I think and once again I really have to highlight both

751
00:42:44,015 --> 00:42:49,619
PopCap and ArenaNet for opening their doors and actually a bunch of different Seattle companies.

752
00:42:49,999 --> 00:42:56,264
We have a series of lectures and meetups at the various studios, Bungie as well, 343 I think,

753
00:42:57,244 --> 00:43:01,287
where they've just invited anyone in the Seattle Game Audio Group to just come.

754
00:43:01,807 --> 00:43:06,910
and give a lecture and hang out and there's often like food and it's just been a wonderful

755
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:10,972
community that has grown out of this because they didn't become too comfortable and just

756
00:43:10,992 --> 00:43:12,293
kind of nine to five it.

757
00:43:13,013 --> 00:43:16,755
Well, and if you're a freelancer on the other side of it, you've got a super vested interest,

758
00:43:16,835 --> 00:43:17,055
right?

759
00:43:17,516 --> 00:43:24,079
Hey, if you put a flag on the moon for community in your town, like all of a sudden people

760
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:24,819
know you.

761
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:32,922
You're the person who is like putting it on the map for people to like get down and you

762
00:43:32,942 --> 00:43:37,848
know share their experience or share their knowledge or you're the person who is bringing

763
00:43:37,888 --> 00:43:43,975
them to a studio and allowing for educational opportunity and as a freelancer, wow.

764
00:43:45,025 --> 00:43:50,288
that kind of thing is great, right? And so you have a great

765
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:54,890
opportunity there maybe with the addition of the extra time you

766
00:43:54,930 --> 00:44:00,493
might have in between things to really do something positive

767
00:44:01,093 --> 00:44:06,776
that has a mutually beneficial kind of plus to it.

768
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:15,472
I was just going to say, I find that as a freelancer it's essential to be more involved

769
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:19,154
in different organizations, go to conferences, go to meetups.

770
00:44:19,394 --> 00:44:22,215
I'm from L.A. and there's just always something going on.

771
00:44:22,255 --> 00:44:27,557
I could spend my entire week going to different VR events.

772
00:44:28,488 --> 00:44:32,850
conferences and stuff I have to actually pick and choose because it can get a little overwhelming.

773
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:37,573
But that's very been very essential for me because I get most of my work from either people that know

774
00:44:37,613 --> 00:44:42,556
me or referrals or people I meet in person at different conferences and stuff so it's been

775
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:47,759
very important. You know I'd like to yeah pick up on that and what you were saying about the

776
00:44:47,779 --> 00:44:53,743
complacency thing because what I found as someone if there's advice I would give to people kind of

777
00:44:53,803 --> 00:44:56,805
traversing this in and out thing is treat

778
00:44:57,622 --> 00:45:03,346
your corporate job, as if you were an indie, needing to both

779
00:45:03,446 --> 00:45:07,309
grow both your skills and the people you're meeting.

780
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:11,312
You don't have the for sale sign-up, but you're active,

781
00:45:11,452 --> 00:45:13,973
and you're not stagnating professionally either.

782
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,716
You're actively seeking out the latest and greatest things.

783
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:21,759
What happens in a corporate setting, you're often asked to focus on a specific thing.

784
00:45:21,779 --> 00:45:24,340
And it's easy just to tunnel vision in, whether it's management,

785
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,763
whether it's a particular type of area in your sound design work.

786
00:45:29,483 --> 00:45:34,827
And you've got to remember, bring the head up and go look broader and keep it active.

787
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:38,529
Because if something comes along like a layoff, hmm,

788
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,911
and you find yourself adrift in the world...

789
00:45:43,609 --> 00:45:46,512
If you've been engaging with community,

790
00:45:47,012 --> 00:45:49,174
you might have your finger on the pulse of what's next.

791
00:45:50,095 --> 00:45:51,156
Yeah, it's all about the people.

792
00:45:51,296 --> 00:45:52,497
That's my motto.

793
00:45:53,538 --> 00:45:56,260
And on that note, that's a great ending for that one.

794
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,902
That was the topics I have.

795
00:45:58,062 --> 00:45:59,783
We'd like to take some questions from the audience.

796
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:03,066
If anybody wants to ask about corporate and or indie

797
00:46:03,226 --> 00:46:05,388
or anything else at all, come up to the mic

798
00:46:05,468 --> 00:46:07,570
and state your purpose.

799
00:46:08,945 --> 00:46:13,968
Hello, hello. Thank you for that talk. I was a little late in the beginning. I got here late. I apologize for that.

800
00:46:14,008 --> 00:46:22,953
But if you haven't already discussed it, what are some, I guess, techniques in giving direction to sound designers

801
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:26,836
who are providing you with sounds in the way that you want to implement them?

802
00:46:27,774 --> 00:46:36,840
Sometimes I have trouble with giving that direction, and then I get the sounds, and I'm like, oh, it's not the, like, I want to create different random containers, and, you know, stuff like that.

803
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:44,645
So the question is, if you're in-house, how do you deal with contractors giving you the sounds you want?

804
00:46:44,665 --> 00:46:45,166
Sure, yeah, yeah.

805
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:46,587
I have to repeat that.

806
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:47,327
Yes.

807
00:46:48,148 --> 00:46:50,989
I'd love to just jump in on that real quick, because my...

808
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:57,393
thought was to, I'm the one trying to change a culture from within to make the people I

809
00:46:57,453 --> 00:47:03,857
work with out of house to be more part of the team. So for instance, allowing source

810
00:47:03,917 --> 00:47:08,340
control if possible or at least being able to create a wise work unit so that the work

811
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:13,644
is more fully integrated as it comes in. That's just one of my personal preferences. And then

812
00:47:13,684 --> 00:47:19,888
you know what you're getting. They're hearing, the intention is already more interlocked.

813
00:47:21,544 --> 00:47:25,086
that note, I would say sure, templatize that stuff for folks

814
00:47:25,126 --> 00:47:30,608
outside the house even. Let me hand you a work unit or a FEV.

815
00:47:30,749 --> 00:47:32,690
And this is the

816
00:47:33,614 --> 00:47:36,956
this is the format, shovel your content into these buckets and

817
00:47:36,976 --> 00:47:40,178
then re-deliver the whole kit and caboodle, right? But I think

818
00:47:40,238 --> 00:47:42,460
I might have heard something else in that question about

819
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,802
like communication of, you know, creative.

820
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:49,564
Yeah, like how to deliver what formats delivered, do I want

821
00:47:49,684 --> 00:47:52,446
one shots, do I want loops, is this animation going to be, do

822
00:47:53,526 --> 00:47:53,806
I want to

823
00:47:54,508 --> 00:47:57,670
bespoke animation, you know, three second or do I want like

824
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,910
three one seconds to put in it, you know, stuff like that.

825
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:05,452
Sure. Communicating elemental systems components, right? And

826
00:48:05,492 --> 00:48:09,374
that's a tough one. I would say that you, the place I would

827
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:13,155
start is establishing the vocabulary. You're going to come

828
00:48:13,235 --> 00:48:15,216
to a contractor with

829
00:48:16,072 --> 00:48:17,753
with the idea, right?

830
00:48:18,434 --> 00:48:21,036
And you're going to have a language that would be easy

831
00:48:21,096 --> 00:48:22,997
for you to describe that.

832
00:48:23,678 --> 00:48:27,441
But I think there's a danger in just jumping to it without

833
00:48:27,601 --> 00:48:31,305
making sure that the words that you use mean the same.

834
00:48:32,466 --> 00:48:35,690
as what they hear when you use those words.

835
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:39,434
And so I guess it's establishing that vocabulary so that,

836
00:48:40,255 --> 00:48:41,977
and establishing it early, right?

837
00:48:42,017 --> 00:48:44,340
Whether that's a style guide kind of thing

838
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,324
where you talk about, you know, things that it...

839
00:48:48,961 --> 00:48:52,123
that explain the aesthetic or whether it's the technical side

840
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:57,825
of it when you say one shot or when you say surface only

841
00:48:58,366 --> 00:49:04,088
material sound, you know, or what is an appropriate amount of

842
00:49:04,148 --> 00:49:08,811
silence at the end of a wave file or attack, you know, just

843
00:49:09,131 --> 00:49:13,853
again, simplify a vocabulary that you can agree on.

844
00:49:14,754 --> 00:49:20,939
And just one thing to add to that, naming conventions and having them be really well thought out are like a gift from God.

845
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:24,823
I mean you can be as anal as you want and as a freelancer, I love that.

846
00:49:25,804 --> 00:49:31,448
Because it just makes sure that there's no confusion later on and you can easily implement stuff in your game

847
00:49:31,508 --> 00:49:37,514
and it just works and there's no, there's no, I think that almost would solve a lot of these issues with vocabulary.

848
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:41,017
Is it just me or does every studio call cutscene the different thing?

849
00:49:41,798 --> 00:49:44,683
Yes, there's vignettes, there's cutscenes, there's cinematics,

850
00:49:44,743 --> 00:49:46,726
and then there's in-game versus pre-rendered.

851
00:49:46,746 --> 00:49:48,629
I mean, it's mind-boggling.

852
00:49:48,649 --> 00:49:49,210
My favorite?

853
00:49:50,152 --> 00:49:51,775
Polygonal cutscenes.

854
00:49:53,798 --> 00:49:54,700
Or polycuts.

855
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:06,667
I was going to say a lot of times projects I work on, sometimes it's as primitive as

856
00:50:06,767 --> 00:50:11,590
Google Docs, but that helps just to have everything mapped out on a spreadsheet with what like . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

857
00:50:12,411 --> 00:50:15,053
you know, the naming convention is, and if it's looping or not

858
00:50:15,093 --> 00:50:17,555
looping, and like the categories of all the sounds and the

859
00:50:17,575 --> 00:50:20,338
material types and everything like, because then if there's

860
00:50:20,378 --> 00:50:22,720
any question and it's in your contractors are working and it's

861
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:25,242
two in the morning, they can keep going. And they don't, you

862
00:50:25,282 --> 00:50:28,124
know, it's good to have stuff written down. That's so much

863
00:50:28,224 --> 00:50:33,589
work. Yeah. And then they can track, you know, also, if they

864
00:50:33,609 --> 00:50:36,992
sent the sound or what, you know, the feedback and all of

865
00:50:37,032 --> 00:50:39,173
that, if they're waiting for feedback, and it just it gets

866
00:50:39,374 --> 00:50:40,655
maybe not in the same document, but

867
00:50:41,278 --> 00:50:43,880
And I feel like the level of aptitude should be really high

868
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:49,465
right now out there with people that are working outside the

869
00:50:49,525 --> 00:50:50,345
fence, right?

870
00:50:50,706 --> 00:50:53,628
So that if you do create a prototype system in a

871
00:50:53,768 --> 00:50:56,450
middleware tool that's extensible, you should be able

872
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:57,331
to hand that to them.

873
00:50:57,351 --> 00:51:00,113
They should be able to read the tea leaves of it and

874
00:51:00,594 --> 00:51:02,976
understand kind of at a glance what you're doing.

875
00:51:03,376 --> 00:51:07,059
So I feel like that is an ecstasy of communication if

876
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:07,500
you can just.

877
00:51:08,057 --> 00:51:09,358
give them that implementation.

878
00:51:09,518 --> 00:51:10,038
Absolutely.

879
00:51:10,819 --> 00:51:11,059
Thank you.

880
00:51:11,539 --> 00:51:11,919
Thank you.

881
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:13,860
Hello.

882
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,401
Thank you for being here and sharing your collective

883
00:51:16,441 --> 00:51:16,801
wisdom.

884
00:51:18,342 --> 00:51:23,364
So in a corporate job, it seems like you have a lot of

885
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:27,226
extrinsic motivation to keep doing your job, because or

886
00:51:27,246 --> 00:51:28,887
else people will be mad at you and whatnot.

887
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:33,010
And same thing if you're actively working on a project when you're indie.

888
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:40,795
But I'm curious to hear about how you go about keeping yourself motivated to keep hustling

889
00:51:40,835 --> 00:51:44,617
when maybe it's sort of a dry spell and there aren't as many projects going on,

890
00:51:45,197 --> 00:51:49,380
but you need to keep working and doing your thing anyways.

891
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,801
Just curious to hear your thoughts on that.

892
00:51:51,762 --> 00:51:54,263
Motivation from a corporate and an indie point of view.

893
00:51:54,564 --> 00:51:54,824
Sure.

894
00:51:55,544 --> 00:51:56,145
I think it's...

895
00:51:57,886 --> 00:51:58,106
Every...

896
00:51:59,058 --> 00:52:03,702
good managers obligation to make sure that their work, the workforce, the people working

897
00:52:03,762 --> 00:52:08,626
for them have something that they're doing at all times, all times, not just down times,

898
00:52:08,946 --> 00:52:10,067
that is inspiring to them.

899
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,643
I have the one thing rule.

900
00:52:13,683 --> 00:52:15,304
Sometimes it's a project I call the one thing rule,

901
00:52:15,744 --> 00:52:17,904
that everybody who was working for me had something

902
00:52:17,924 --> 00:52:19,365
that they were like into.

903
00:52:20,025 --> 00:52:22,585
And whether it was something directly related to a project

904
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:24,446
we were working on, and usually that was the case,

905
00:52:24,466 --> 00:52:26,126
it's like, I want to do this for this project.

906
00:52:26,186 --> 00:52:26,946
Great, that helps us.

907
00:52:27,106 --> 00:52:29,287
And you get to do the one thing or two things, right?

908
00:52:29,867 --> 00:52:31,948
So you're always doing something that's keeping you

909
00:52:31,988 --> 00:52:33,088
in a growth mindset.

910
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:33,848
That's the other side.

911
00:52:34,128 --> 00:52:35,568
Make sure they're always doing something

912
00:52:35,588 --> 00:52:36,709
where they're learning something.

913
00:52:37,569 --> 00:52:39,249
And learning something that they want to learn,

914
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:41,190
even if it's not directly related to their project.

915
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:48,135
Right. And as an indie, same deal. More so. So, like, there have been times when I've been working

916
00:52:48,235 --> 00:52:53,179
on a project and it's a bunch of work from Google, and then there was like this lull before, you know,

917
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:56,762
I wasn't sure what the next thing was going to be, but there was this lull. And so instead of

918
00:52:57,903 --> 00:53:01,846
trying to generate work, I just started doing things that I wanted to do. I started getting

919
00:53:01,866 --> 00:53:05,249
more into programming. I built a little game that demonstrated this, uh...

920
00:53:06,001 --> 00:53:09,067
interactive audio idea that I hadn't seen any place else and I just wanted to

921
00:53:09,548 --> 00:53:14,158
demonstrate it so I could show it to people and that just that wasn't

922
00:53:14,198 --> 00:53:16,603
generating any money for me but it was certainly

923
00:53:18,136 --> 00:53:22,920
flexing my programming skills, showing that I knew what was happening in the interactive

924
00:53:22,981 --> 00:53:28,265
audio world, showing that I was innovative and had some creativity involved, and those

925
00:53:28,466 --> 00:53:31,709
apps that I then published helped me get the next gig.

926
00:53:32,669 --> 00:53:38,094
And so, you know, it's not, particularly when you're freelance, there is no downtime.

927
00:53:38,695 --> 00:53:41,458
If you're not always working all the time, you should be.

928
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:48,332
Right, it's a good time to do some marketing too, like go do lunch meetings and more conferences

929
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:51,613
and more meetups and things like that if you have downtime.

930
00:53:51,633 --> 00:53:56,994
Because that also will help, I know for me, I get kind of isolated working mostly now

931
00:53:57,094 --> 00:54:02,556
from my home studio, so it's really like a big boost to my creativity and motivation

932
00:54:02,596 --> 00:54:06,857
to go and meet people and talk about what's happening with what they're working on and

933
00:54:06,957 --> 00:54:08,358
just kind of get plugged in again.

934
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:12,761
kind of like what's happening right now i told my clients i am unavailable this

935
00:54:12,801 --> 00:54:14,022
week and doing this

936
00:54:14,983 --> 00:54:16,044
and uh...

937
00:54:16,825 --> 00:54:21,268
and i think marketing extends to not only

938
00:54:21,648 --> 00:54:24,891
let's say phone calls emails and meetups but also

939
00:54:25,631 --> 00:54:29,594
blog posts tutorial videos

940
00:54:30,175 --> 00:54:31,776
rocking your resume

941
00:54:32,236 --> 00:54:34,058
there's there's a whole slew of marketing

942
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:40,141
that I would maybe consider soft marketing, where it's more like, you know, trying to

943
00:54:40,922 --> 00:54:51,367
establish you and your discipline or your company as someone who knows something, I guess.

944
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:58,911
And that kind of marketing can go a long way towards, oh, eventuality of a gig at some point.

945
00:54:59,401 --> 00:55:06,750
Yes, so just two quick things. One, I would say keep a diary of side projects that you want to do, but you have absolutely no time to do so.

946
00:55:07,431 --> 00:55:13,899
I love Trello. I have it on my phone and my computer and everything. And whenever I have any idea of I would love to do this, but I don't have time, just do that.

947
00:55:13,939 --> 00:55:18,444
You will never go drive because you'll always have something to do. And secondly, and this is very specific.

948
00:55:19,565 --> 00:55:24,470
I don't know if you had a chance to see this, but Anton Voltec from Guerrilla had a wonderful

949
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:30,035
talk where he basically outlined three different stages of development.

950
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:35,420
I know the generic industry definition is, you know, you're in crunch mode and you're

951
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,422
in whatever, but he called them waves.

952
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:42,345
Basically, he would say, OK, well, you'll be before the wave,

953
00:55:42,485 --> 00:55:44,365
which is when things are not so busy.

954
00:55:44,706 --> 00:55:46,847
And he had a great list of things that you can do.

955
00:55:46,867 --> 00:55:51,248
I think they're applied both to freelance and corporate, things

956
00:55:51,268 --> 00:55:52,589
you can do when you're not so busy,

957
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:54,550
but that'll help you when you're in the wave,

958
00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:57,331
and you're so busy that you're just, OK, it's

959
00:55:57,671 --> 00:55:59,852
time to just work on this and not worry too much

960
00:55:59,892 --> 00:56:01,953
about process, because there's no time to deal with that.

961
00:56:02,293 --> 00:56:05,094
And then after the wave, where it's basically boiled down

962
00:56:05,134 --> 00:56:05,935
to analyzing.

963
00:56:06,435 --> 00:56:09,435
how you were working during crunch mode or whatever you

964
00:56:09,455 --> 00:56:12,276
want to call it and trying to fix things that maybe went

965
00:56:12,316 --> 00:56:16,677
wrong or work flow issues or whatever it ends up being. I

966
00:56:16,717 --> 00:56:19,257
would definitely check that out in the vault whenever it comes

967
00:56:19,277 --> 00:56:19,317
up.

968
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:22,518
Yeah, exactly. It's very prescient here. And the last

969
00:56:22,538 --> 00:56:26,859
thing I'll just add to that is that if you're in house, like

970
00:56:27,499 --> 00:56:30,220
maybe you're in production, you don't have time to experiment

971
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,780
with things, but you're going to be in that wave situation. And

972
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,881
I would say that probably the thing that

973
00:56:36,822 --> 00:56:43,869
one should always return to in those times of question over what is next or what should

974
00:56:43,889 --> 00:56:51,315
be done is advocacy. Like reaching out to other disciplines and departments in-house

975
00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:57,801
and firming up relationships or creating new relationships that can then continue to carry

976
00:56:57,821 --> 00:56:59,362
you through that production process.

977
00:57:03,328 --> 00:57:08,849
Thanks. I thoroughly enjoyed this and I agree about Anton's talk. That was really great.

978
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:14,831
I want to revisit it even though I've got it memorized and repeating in my head. My

979
00:57:14,871 --> 00:57:22,273
question is I came from corporate, I've gone freelance, and I'm now sort of considering

980
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:30,456
going back in-house. And I've come to really love my work-life balance and the freedom

981
00:57:30,476 --> 00:57:31,416
that I'm able to create.

982
00:57:32,697 --> 00:57:37,020
because as creatives it's sort of you have your specific zones during the day

983
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:43,144
where you find I am in it and it's like those are your you make those your

984
00:57:43,184 --> 00:57:50,110
untouchables and you get so much done. I guess my question is related to some of

985
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:52,411
the topics you brought up in terms of

986
00:57:54,433 --> 00:57:59,803
politics and then maintaining that work-life balance because that's, I guess, a fear of

987
00:57:59,883 --> 00:58:02,568
mine is going in-house and losing a bit of that.

988
00:58:03,149 --> 00:58:05,994
So what would be your

989
00:58:07,829 --> 00:58:17,659
advice to question and inquire about both the current manager's ability to deflect politics

990
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:26,687
as well as the ability to manage your work-life balance and not be sort of slaved to that

991
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:27,668
crunch or burnout.

992
00:58:28,569 --> 00:58:31,872
So the question being work-life balance from a corporate point of view.

993
00:58:32,902 --> 00:58:38,587
I'm a little bit off the beaten path in that I don't believe there is such a thing.

994
00:58:39,147 --> 00:58:41,970
I think work is life, is life is work, and it's all the same stuff to me.

995
00:58:43,011 --> 00:58:46,373
I don't have a wife and kids or, you know, other stuff I do besides.

996
00:58:46,754 --> 00:58:48,896
Basically, if I'm not working, I'm not living.

997
00:58:50,757 --> 00:58:55,881
And in a corporate situation, even then, I always try to do...

998
00:58:57,102 --> 00:59:01,725
I work from this time to this time, and when I'm in this mode I'm in that, and then afterwards

999
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:07,309
I'm doing something else, just even kind of let my brain decompress from what was happening

1000
00:59:07,329 --> 00:59:07,949
during that time.

1001
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:12,833
I tend to try and do that even when I'm freelance, so that the definition of work

1002
00:59:15,801 --> 00:59:17,142
And also, I'm working now.

1003
00:59:17,202 --> 00:59:18,143
This is my work time.

1004
00:59:18,584 --> 00:59:22,467
And then everything else I do is life, but some of it is

1005
00:59:22,527 --> 00:59:25,889
even kind of I'm not working so that I can go back to work

1006
00:59:25,949 --> 00:59:28,051
better kind of thing.

1007
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:29,032
But that's just me.

1008
00:59:29,552 --> 00:59:29,932
I'm not.

1009
00:59:30,853 --> 00:59:33,755
It's interesting that you kind of are more wary of the

1010
00:59:33,815 --> 00:59:35,777
corporate workplace for work-life balance.

1011
00:59:35,857 --> 00:59:37,899
And I think a lot of indie people would argue that that's

1012
00:59:37,939 --> 00:59:41,221
a more dangerous place for work-life balance.

1013
00:59:41,622 --> 00:59:42,842
In corporate, you don't really.

1014
00:59:43,998 --> 00:59:47,440
have a choice necessarily i mean it's it's just it kind of is what it is

1015
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:52,324
well that you can you can do your best but at a certain point it it might be a

1016
00:59:52,364 --> 00:59:55,746
situation where if you just find that a studio is being kind of toxic

1017
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:59,549
where yeah you know making people stay till midnight or whatever then

1018
00:59:59,649 --> 01:00:00,910
maybe it's time to leave

1019
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:04,653
I would say you do have a choice in some ways.

1020
01:00:05,033 --> 01:00:07,895
Remember, you're interviewing the corporation as well as

1021
01:00:07,955 --> 01:00:08,895
they're interviewing you.

1022
01:00:09,336 --> 01:00:11,957
And you have to kind of become aware of what that culture is

1023
01:00:12,077 --> 01:00:13,398
known for and what it's like.

1024
01:00:13,678 --> 01:00:15,019
And there's ways to find out.

1025
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,562
That's exactly what I'm asking for, is what's the best ways

1026
01:00:18,602 --> 01:00:19,202
to kind of find that out.

1027
01:00:19,222 --> 01:00:20,483
To talk to other people who work there.

1028
01:00:20,963 --> 01:00:22,744
And then actually, and you don't have to do this during

1029
01:00:22,764 --> 01:00:23,865
an interview, it's kind of awkward.

1030
01:00:26,026 --> 01:00:28,491
But you do your own intel from colleagues.

1031
01:00:28,871 --> 01:00:31,736
But then after you get a job, then say, well, what is this

1032
01:00:31,796 --> 01:00:33,079
like before I decide?

1033
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:36,645
Now it's my turn to say, what can I make this?

1034
01:00:38,518 --> 01:00:46,781
I'll share in-house experience just very briefly because ArenaNet is very public about their

1035
01:00:46,821 --> 01:00:47,701
work-life balance.

1036
01:00:47,741 --> 01:00:51,843
And so this was something that they were very forthcoming about and definitely something

1037
01:00:51,923 --> 01:00:55,084
I'm concerned about as someone who's in-house.

1038
01:00:55,164 --> 01:00:59,645
And again, I think when you find a company who's willing to say, yeah, work-life balance,

1039
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:01,046
we get it, right?

1040
01:01:01,526 --> 01:01:06,168
I think you've found a mature company that's willing to accept responsibility for that.

1041
01:01:07,518 --> 01:01:12,222
and what that means for a schedule and for a culture.

1042
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,444
So I would say demand it.

1043
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:16,786
We are out of time.

1044
01:01:17,026 --> 01:01:18,007
Thank you all so much.

1045
01:01:18,027 --> 01:01:19,107
I want to thank our panelists.
