1
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:11,962
Hey everybody. Oh, I guess I have my own mic. Perfect. Well, we're going to jump in there.

2
00:00:13,203 --> 00:00:18,104
So here we are, like at GDC, right? It's a week about talking about our favorite games.

3
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:22,526
But just for like a very quick moment, I want to stop talking about games and instead talk

4
00:00:22,546 --> 00:00:28,548
about people, right? Because society has this nasty habit of celebrating the final product

5
00:00:29,008 --> 00:00:33,290
instead of the people and their journeys to actually make that final game or that final

6
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:33,910
product, right?

7
00:00:34,942 --> 00:00:41,031
So hopefully you've noticed this recent trend, especially in the game scene, where no matter

8
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:44,636
what kind of team you're on, no matter what size your team is, no matter who you are,

9
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:49,924
people are starting to really prioritize the communities that they surround themselves in.

10
00:00:50,805 --> 00:00:53,426
And today we'll be talking basically on how to build a

11
00:00:53,466 --> 00:00:57,507
co-working space, right? After our own bumpy road, and with the

12
00:00:57,567 --> 00:01:01,528
hope to both warn you, but also inspire you. So most of these

13
00:01:01,548 --> 00:01:04,389
lessons come from GameNest. GameNest is an independent,

14
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,351
inclusive co-working space just for indie game developers,

15
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:10,171
right? It's a place for...

16
00:01:11,592 --> 00:01:16,813
It's a place for experienced indies, for motivated students, all different kinds of developers,

17
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:21,254
and again it's those folks who want to surround themselves with people who really understand

18
00:01:21,294 --> 00:01:24,635
the challenges of making a game and what that process is like.

19
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:28,155
It's a co-working space, which means it's pretty much like a shared office.

20
00:01:28,295 --> 00:01:32,556
People bring in their computers, they rent desks, we have a lot of events like an internal

21
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:34,757
feedback Friday or maybe large monthly parties.

22
00:01:35,477 --> 00:01:39,178
It's also important to give context for what GameRest is not.

23
00:01:39,218 --> 00:01:40,618
So it's not sponsored by any...

24
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:49,265
Also being in San Francisco, it is more focused just for indie

25
00:01:49,285 --> 00:01:52,107
game developers. So it's not just a general tech co-working

26
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:54,429
space or incubator or anything like that. It's a co-working

27
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:57,231
space for indies and indie game development.

28
00:01:57,852 --> 00:02:00,793
So for a brief history, we started planning this all in

29
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:01,814
October 2014.

30
00:02:01,914 --> 00:02:05,376
We opened our days on the very first day of January 2015.

31
00:02:05,816 --> 00:02:10,118
And then the people crazy enough to try this was yours

32
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:10,599
truly.

33
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:12,600
My name's Dylan Jones on the bottom.

34
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,301
That's Jannevin Nordhangen, Jim Fleming, and?

35
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:16,022
Hey, everybody.

36
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,022
I'm Danielle Swank.

37
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:17,082
So.

38
00:02:19,544 --> 00:02:25,209
Co-working. There's pretty much five basic steps to starting and running your own co-working space.

39
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:29,413
And the first thing, and probably the most important thing, is your people.

40
00:02:29,953 --> 00:02:35,739
You really, really have to find a group, because co-working exists in a group.

41
00:02:36,965 --> 00:02:38,326
So, you know, there's this...

42
00:02:39,087 --> 00:02:44,612
Gameness started kind of officially as an idea back in IndieCade at 2014.

43
00:02:45,693 --> 00:02:47,554
And I was in the audience just like you.

44
00:02:48,095 --> 00:02:51,638
And I was listening to this person from Glitch City talk about their space

45
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,840
and what they were doing together, and I'm like,

46
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,544
oh my goodness, this is the most amazing thing ever.

47
00:02:58,324 --> 00:02:59,925
I want to go and I want to do this.

48
00:03:00,386 --> 00:03:03,148
And these are all my friends and this is them down in LA.

49
00:03:03,408 --> 00:03:05,189
Well, not all of my friends, but you know.

50
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:12,515
And I got them all together and we all got drunk and we stayed up really late planning

51
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:13,835
what this space might look like.

52
00:03:14,776 --> 00:03:18,920
And I woke up in the morning and I realized I was actually serious about it.

53
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:24,105
So I got on Craigslist, looked up a couple of spaces, and I sent out an email.

54
00:03:24,945 --> 00:03:28,689
And the next day, Dylan was back in SF looking at spaces.

55
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:29,850
It was really amazing.

56
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:35,555
GameDesk isn't just here and isn't just these people.

57
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:39,419
It wouldn't exist without a larger community.

58
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,302
And so for us, that means meetup groups.

59
00:03:42,942 --> 00:03:45,465
So for the past couple years,

60
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:47,467
both Dylan and I have been running different meetup groups.

61
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:49,569
Dylan runs one focused on indie developers.

62
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,331
It has about a thousand members.

63
00:03:51,591 --> 00:03:53,933
I run one focused on learning how to make games

64
00:03:54,013 --> 00:03:54,474
that has about 800.

65
00:03:55,595 --> 00:04:00,381
And you really, really want to start with this kind of core group of people in order

66
00:04:00,421 --> 00:04:02,063
to round out your space.

67
00:04:02,103 --> 00:04:06,848
Because the one thing that you don't want to do is open the doors January 1st and there

68
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:10,212
be nobody in the space and all empty desks.

69
00:04:10,913 --> 00:04:11,834
So that's great.

70
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:13,296
So you have a bunch of people.

71
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,217
What do you do next, Dylan?

72
00:04:15,096 --> 00:04:17,959
Well, you've got to find the spot to put them where they all are, right?

73
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:19,720
So you've got to find that home base.

74
00:04:20,221 --> 00:04:22,623
And that's that second step in this process, right?

75
00:04:23,084 --> 00:04:24,845
And as always, when you're starting something new,

76
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:26,987
you're going to be filled with a long list of questions.

77
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:28,869
And that's okay, right?

78
00:04:28,929 --> 00:04:31,292
That's fine. Don't be afraid to just ask.

79
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,453
That's what we did.

80
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:33,814
Literally, sometimes we had friends,

81
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:37,558
sometimes we would just cold call or email people, right?

82
00:04:38,418 --> 00:04:40,060
And, you know, if you're thinking of doing that,

83
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,542
Or if you're thinking of building a space like this, just shoot us a note.

84
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:45,883
Shoot other people a note. This is the game industry.

85
00:04:46,123 --> 00:04:49,544
It's filled with a bunch of awesome people that want to help out.

86
00:04:49,564 --> 00:04:52,686
We talked to folks down at Glitch City who told us to go a little bit bigger.

87
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:56,668
Robin Hunneke over at Phenomena was kind enough to give us some great San Francisco real estate advice.

88
00:04:57,028 --> 00:05:01,530
I used to work out of a closet with some other indies at Double Fine, and they gave us some good culture tips.

89
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,591
Again, so the moral of this slide is...

90
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:11,520
Just ask. In addition, know where you can compromise. This is always a big one, but consider public

91
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,386
transportation so it's easy for folks just to swing by your space. Consider if your building

92
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:19,710
is ADA approved and can you do anything to make it more ADA.

93
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:22,893
How many square feet do you need?

94
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:24,996
Keep in mind that when you're talking about square feet,

95
00:05:25,016 --> 00:05:26,217
there's a Goldilocks there.

96
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:29,580
So you might want a big, massive space for events

97
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,802
to house all your friends in there.

98
00:05:30,862 --> 00:05:33,685
But you don't want it to feel empty on the day-to-day

99
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:35,006
when people are actually working there.

100
00:05:35,086 --> 00:05:36,487
So where is your sweet spot?

101
00:05:36,507 --> 00:05:37,188
And that'll change.

102
00:05:37,869 --> 00:05:40,671
Does the layout allow you to have enough members to pay your

103
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:44,494
actual bills? And if that's the case, how many bathrooms do you

104
00:05:44,534 --> 00:05:47,036
need? All those bizarre little questions like that. And since

105
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:50,859
for us it was just all out of our pocket, price was definitely

106
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,523
the biggest one. And please know that the cheaper something is,

107
00:05:56,663 --> 00:06:00,266
the more time it will probably take you to fix it up. Like,

108
00:06:00,286 --> 00:06:04,809
this is a shot, we almost moved into this funky butcher shop

109
00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:05,450
here. It had like a

110
00:06:09,932 --> 00:06:12,033
We fell in love with this spot on Valencia.

111
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:16,535
But if you're used to making games, you're probably not going to say, hey, we should

112
00:06:16,555 --> 00:06:18,556
check the zoning laws here first.

113
00:06:18,976 --> 00:06:20,997
That wasn't my first impression of it.

114
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:25,479
But when we went to the city planning department, which you should totally go to no matter what

115
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,341
city you're in, check your property, the city planning department, we realized we could

116
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:32,643
actually get in some trouble for building an office thing and maybe a residential zone.

117
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:38,846
But eventually, funnily enough, I found this cell phone picture

118
00:06:39,506 --> 00:06:43,408
of a computer screen that was showing a Google Maps street

119
00:06:43,448 --> 00:06:44,788
view of the outside of this property.

120
00:06:45,068 --> 00:06:48,330
Like, that was the entire profile for this real estate

121
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:48,950
piece of property.

122
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:52,932
And I said, well, this is either like a classic Craigslist

123
00:06:52,952 --> 00:06:56,673
scam, or nobody else has visited this place, and maybe

124
00:06:56,713 --> 00:06:58,714
it's the only spot we could afford, and it'll be perfect

125
00:06:58,754 --> 00:06:59,034
for us.

126
00:06:59,695 --> 00:07:00,796
It turns out that it was the latter.

127
00:07:01,636 --> 00:07:04,018
So it was a great space, though it needed a ton of work.

128
00:07:04,538 --> 00:07:06,940
But I tell you this story because, I mean,

129
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,842
this co-working space is on the very brink of not happening

130
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:10,883
at all, right?

131
00:07:11,343 --> 00:07:14,345
And if you can find, or if we can find a spot in the real

132
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:16,847
estate hell that is San Francisco, I assure you,

133
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:19,209
all of you can go out and find much cooler spots

134
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:19,769
anywhere else.

135
00:07:22,967 --> 00:07:24,947
Keep in mind, though, we made those compromises that I was

136
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:25,587
talking about.

137
00:07:26,267 --> 00:07:28,568
Sometimes we have a line for the bathroom, and you'll have

138
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:29,468
to make compromises, too.

139
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:30,788
Know where you want to settle on that.

140
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,569
Know what your criteria are.

141
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:33,909
Know what's specific to you.

142
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:34,889
Really think about this stuff.

143
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:37,910
Is it with your group, if you have some founding members

144
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,650
with that, do you want a grungy spot?

145
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,631
Do you want a cleaner spot?

146
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:41,631
How big is it?

147
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:42,651
Do you want a conference room?

148
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,431
Do you need a kitchen?

149
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,492
Again, how many bathrooms do you need?

150
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,933
To warn you about this process, we'll see if this

151
00:07:52,214 --> 00:07:59,258
It is to show you, you can find it online, it's a little flash forward GSC video.

152
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:06,223
But it is literally us on our hands and on our knees redoing all these floors, literally

153
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,084
like construction work.

154
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:10,185
And thankfully Danielle knew a ton about construction.

155
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:12,427
But it still took us...

156
00:08:13,107 --> 00:08:17,611
I'm going to show you how to do that.

157
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:19,353
Hopefully you can check out that video and see it.

158
00:08:19,553 --> 00:08:24,317
It's a fun little video, but what it also does is it also

159
00:08:24,497 --> 00:08:28,481
edits out the really hard parts. That's the nice thing about nice

160
00:08:28,501 --> 00:08:30,783
little videos. It's this great little montage.

161
00:08:31,263 --> 00:08:33,865
Please know, just like making a game and when you're getting into this stuff,

162
00:08:33,885 --> 00:08:34,366
you can do this.

163
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:36,929
I mean, be prepared for burnout in there, right?

164
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,372
I don't want to be up here and hand out rose-tinted glasses.

165
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:43,536
There was some incredibly physical and also emotionally

166
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,357
hard work in there.

167
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:48,782
And I mean, you can get, just like a game, kind of stressed

168
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:50,484
out and emotionally burdened at times.

169
00:08:50,544 --> 00:08:52,125
And be prepared for that.

170
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,447
Yeah.

171
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,421
The other thing, other than construction, the other thing that you're going to get

172
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:01,602
really familiar with when running a co-working space is spreadsheets.

173
00:09:02,283 --> 00:09:03,864
It's all about numbers.

174
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:09,947
And I wanted to show this slide because what stood out to me when I was pulling pictures

175
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:13,409
for this presentation is the time step up at the top.

176
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:19,293
So that's taken at 10.51 p.m. on a Friday night, and what we're probably doing is pouring

177
00:09:19,353 --> 00:09:20,614
over this document.

178
00:09:21,154 --> 00:09:23,936
So this is GameNest startup costs.

179
00:09:25,438 --> 00:09:32,069
We started GameNest with a budget of $24,000, which sounds like a lot of money.

180
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:33,932
Sounds like, I mean, it's a lot of money to me.

181
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,218
That's $6,000 from each of the four co-founders.

182
00:09:39,216 --> 00:09:44,838
And what you have to know is that landlords don't necessarily like to rent to new businesses.

183
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,459
It's very difficult.

184
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:49,060
It's not like running an apartment where they just want first and last.

185
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:54,322
They may want first, last, three months or six months of rent going in.

186
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:58,184
So with GameNest, we had to give our landlord $16,000 just to get in the door.

187
00:10:01,271 --> 00:10:02,231
That's huge, right?

188
00:10:03,012 --> 00:10:06,793
So we were left with only $8,000 to do everything.

189
00:10:07,114 --> 00:10:09,795
And that's getting chairs for 20 people.

190
00:10:09,835 --> 00:10:11,355
That's getting desks for everybody.

191
00:10:11,415 --> 00:10:13,997
That's paying all our business license fees.

192
00:10:14,297 --> 00:10:15,277
That's getting a router.

193
00:10:15,377 --> 00:10:16,498
And it's all the construction.

194
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:17,358
So it's painting.

195
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:18,439
It's ripping up the floors.

196
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:22,580
That $8,000 goes by so quickly.

197
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:24,821
Like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

198
00:10:25,362 --> 00:10:31,563
Hi. And so, you know, just know that. Like when you're in the

199
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:34,684
process of doing your build out and you're spending a lot of

200
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:37,624
money, things don't, maybe don't seem like they're that big of a

201
00:10:37,664 --> 00:10:40,685
deal. You just want to be careful and aware because

202
00:10:40,745 --> 00:10:43,065
otherwise you'll overshoot your budget by a couple thousand

203
00:10:43,105 --> 00:10:46,646
dollars. And for me, that's a lot of money. So I just, you

204
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:50,647
know, and you'll make mistakes. Like this is a receipt where we

205
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:51,307
spent $25 on a roll of tape.

206
00:10:53,775 --> 00:10:56,917
You know, it happens. Try not to make it happen on a regular

207
00:10:56,957 --> 00:11:01,220
basis. Or maybe things are just surprising. This is one that

208
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,243
surprised me. When I was in college, like, mini fridges, I

209
00:11:06,263 --> 00:11:09,125
think, are about $100, right? Like, that's about how much I

210
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:11,947
paid. However, the mini fridge that we had to get for GameNest

211
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:17,411
was $400 because it had to be big enough to get everybody's

212
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:20,212
lunches but still small enough to fit under our counter and it

213
00:11:20,253 --> 00:11:22,914
just had a bunch of weird requirements. And so our mini

214
00:11:23,134 --> 00:11:23,375
fridge.

215
00:11:23,655 --> 00:11:24,516
Cost $400.

216
00:11:26,738 --> 00:11:30,802
The other thing that you're going to really, really want to

217
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:34,146
pay attention to is your local costs and your ongoing

218
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,768
operating costs, not just your build out.

219
00:11:36,108 --> 00:11:39,432
So this slide, if you look at that up in the upper right

220
00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:42,775
hand corner and that blue box that's highlighted, that's our

221
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:43,957
running cost for the year.

222
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:47,723
and we did this spreadsheet ahead of time.

223
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:52,667
And our actual running costs came out to be about within a couple thousand dollars of

224
00:11:52,808 --> 00:11:53,408
that price.

225
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:56,611
That is what it takes to keep GameNest up and running.

226
00:11:58,493 --> 00:12:00,094
And so, you know, that's a number.

227
00:12:00,514 --> 00:12:04,338
And that number is neither good or bad, it's just something that you have to be aware of.

228
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:08,441
And then once you have a number like that, what you have to start doing...

229
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:13,415
math and matrix math. So, like, what does that mean? That means

230
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:17,880
there's going to be a sweet spot between how much I charge people

231
00:12:18,001 --> 00:12:21,065
and how many people I can get in. And for us in San Francisco,

232
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:22,026
that's $350 for a full-time membership.

233
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:31,259
The other thing that you want to do is you want to look really carefully at the bottom of the spreadsheet and our projected members number.

234
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:44,346
So I said earlier that Dylan has a meetup group of a thousand people and that sounds like a lot of people, but there's a huge gulf between people who like the idea of co-working in theory and people who actually give you money to co-work with you.

235
00:12:45,646 --> 00:12:49,508
And so you want to be, when you're doing the numbers, be as negative as possible.

236
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:51,329
Like, be...

237
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:58,215
mean. So like our numbers were like 16 of those will show up.

238
00:12:58,895 --> 00:13:01,957
And I had the names of each of those 16 people. And I'm like

239
00:13:02,038 --> 00:13:05,901
okay. And in the next month maybe I can convince another

240
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:08,523
four people to join up and then maybe another four after that.

241
00:13:08,883 --> 00:13:14,847
So I would do your budget with that kind of math in mind. For

242
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:18,770
us our break even numbers are 24 full-time people in the space.

243
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:23,387
And we do that, but those are also really nice and conservative.

244
00:13:23,947 --> 00:13:27,948
The other thing, too, is if you have a lot of members, the quality of the space can start

245
00:13:27,988 --> 00:13:29,828
going down because it gets really noisy.

246
00:13:30,428 --> 00:13:32,708
So there's a lot of balancing act that goes on.

247
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:39,270
The other thing I really want to recommend with running your space is, and helping you

248
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,350
with the numbers, is co-working software.

249
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,351
So we use Cobot, and that's a screenshot of it.

250
00:13:46,673 --> 00:13:50,655
And it's wonderful because it automatically builds our members.

251
00:13:51,336 --> 00:13:53,817
So we can take credit cards, which is huge.

252
00:13:53,837 --> 00:13:56,238
I don't have to have a credit card account set up with a

253
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:56,998
bank or anything.

254
00:13:57,078 --> 00:13:57,839
I can just take them.

255
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,000
Because what you don't want to do is you don't want to chase

256
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:03,642
down all your friends every month, or a check, or get in

257
00:14:03,702 --> 00:14:05,723
some cash and not keep track of it.

258
00:14:06,223 --> 00:14:07,884
It saves you so much time.

259
00:14:08,864 --> 00:14:12,046
And I want to wrap up with the fact that indie game

260
00:14:12,066 --> 00:14:13,666
development is very boom and bust.

261
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:19,045
I think everybody knows that not always, you know, checks don't come in for a publisher,

262
00:14:19,065 --> 00:14:22,991
or we maybe don't make enough, or just things happen.

263
00:14:23,331 --> 00:14:28,298
So we take a security deposit equal to one month's rent.

264
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:31,923
And that's important because if somebody can't make their rent

265
00:14:32,003 --> 00:14:34,206
on the first of the month, what I don't want to do is kick them

266
00:14:34,246 --> 00:14:39,731
out on the second. They're my friends. So we just use the

267
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:42,073
security deposit and if their checks come in, if everything

268
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:45,496
works, they can re-op, everything's fine. And if they

269
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:48,979
don't, everybody has a month to get used to the idea that the

270
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,744
relationship is changing. So those are the big numbers that

271
00:14:53,784 --> 00:14:54,284
I'd recommend.

272
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:02,108
Yeah, absolutely. And you know, you really need these tools so that you can get back into making your game full-time, right?

273
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:05,291
Instead of organizing the space full-time. That's vital.

274
00:15:06,312 --> 00:15:11,258
And, you know, the fourth step here is staying true, right? It's staying true to what you set out to build.

275
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:16,665
We encourage you to make your own pillars, like really decide what you want early on

276
00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:21,852
as your small group, write them down, post them up on the wall, save them.

277
00:15:21,892 --> 00:15:26,558
We came up with our pillars as being diversity, community, and great games.

278
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:33,447
So for diversity, what's the best way to make sure that you're an inclusive environment and keeping it a safe space?

279
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:38,493
Well, we have basically an application that says, hey, what kind of games have you worked on in the past?

280
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,796
What are you looking to get out of a co-working space?

281
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:43,419
Do you identify as any traditionally marginalized groups?

282
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,162
And mostly that's for us so that we can get a high level

283
00:15:46,182 --> 00:15:49,104
understanding of where we sit so that we know when we need to

284
00:15:49,144 --> 00:15:51,486
do further outreach and start getting the word out there more

285
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:55,850
and more. Again, if you have any ideas about this or anything

286
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,772
else in between, please come up and say hi. We're always

287
00:15:58,312 --> 00:16:01,035
looking forward to hearing that kind of stuff. And for our

288
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:05,458
second pillar is community. And one of the ways that I reflect

289
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:08,421
on our progress that way is basically looking at a series

290
00:16:08,521 --> 00:16:08,581
of

291
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:13,288
I'll scroll through some of ours but this is only to get you

292
00:16:13,308 --> 00:16:16,372
excited about your own moments that you're going to have when

293
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:20,158
you open your own space. You'll have these nuggets, these little

294
00:16:20,258 --> 00:16:24,023
memories that will make it all worth it. I'm a sucker for

295
00:16:24,043 --> 00:16:26,925
for nostalgia. But half the reason I post pictures onto the

296
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:29,466
GameNest Twitter is so that we have like an almost scrapbook

297
00:16:29,886 --> 00:16:32,648
kind of thing. And I encourage you to actually catalog your

298
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:36,190
fun, right? This is when we hosted Lost Levels. We highly

299
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:39,151
recommend events because it helps get the word out there for

300
00:16:39,311 --> 00:16:41,832
new members, new potential members to join you. It also

301
00:16:41,872 --> 00:16:44,574
keeps all your current members really engaged, right? It also

302
00:16:44,894 --> 00:16:48,015
makes it a destination. And most importantly, it unites your

303
00:16:48,055 --> 00:16:50,717
local scene, you know, your local game development scene all

304
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:51,377
under one roof.

305
00:16:54,302 --> 00:16:57,965
and get involved with local ARG artists or real world games.

306
00:16:58,445 --> 00:17:01,407
Help make your space like an actual destination,

307
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:02,448
if that's what you're into, right?

308
00:17:02,508 --> 00:17:05,750
One of my favorite moments was when we had the racket

309
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,412
throw this crazy murder mystery extravaganza thing,

310
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:11,074
and I had a friend who actually found out about this event

311
00:17:11,094 --> 00:17:12,895
like randomly and showed up.

312
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:14,236
And I said, whoa, what are you doing here?

313
00:17:14,296 --> 00:17:17,238
And like, honestly, if that doesn't get you excited,

314
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:19,500
that's kind of like as good as it gets

315
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,881
when you're running a coworking space.

316
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,567
So, you know, maybe it's the little things, like you just want to get lunch with some

317
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:28,050
friends and talk about the latest games you've been playing.

318
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:32,997
Maybe it's being able to harbor indies from out of town and they need some internet, right?

319
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:37,123
Maybe it's having the perfect place to host your favorite game jam.

320
00:17:37,884 --> 00:17:40,988
where it's a giant, giant tutorial room for teaching new

321
00:17:41,008 --> 00:17:44,232
developers how to make games, right? And really, where else

322
00:17:44,252 --> 00:17:47,757
are you going to find an indie video game themed Halloween,

323
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:52,363
right? Unless you make that space, that awesome may not ever

324
00:17:52,443 --> 00:17:55,067
exist, right? You have to go out and build that.

325
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:57,729
And that was one of the things actually that we really learned.

326
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:00,931
It was really, you know, once you build it, it's so easy to

327
00:18:00,971 --> 00:18:01,792
enable these things.

328
00:18:02,673 --> 00:18:05,715
You know, really all it takes is just encouraging your members

329
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:06,656
to make their own events.

330
00:18:07,156 --> 00:18:09,898
Some of the most successful events we've had are like Game

331
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:13,061
of the Fortnite, which is like imagine a book club but with a

332
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:15,142
video game, so you all play the same thing and then talk about

333
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:15,222
it.

334
00:18:15,623 --> 00:18:19,225
And also these monthly giant out of the shell parties that we

335
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:19,446
have.

336
00:18:19,486 --> 00:18:21,667
So these are just some posters that people make to, you know,

337
00:18:21,687 --> 00:18:22,728
get the word out about the space.

338
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:26,391
And again, also we're having a party on Thursday. You're all

339
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:29,353
totally invited. Check that out online. But, you know, just out

340
00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:32,996
of the shell fun parties like that. Again, that third pillar

341
00:18:33,116 --> 00:18:36,118
is helping people make great games. And, of course, like that

342
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:39,301
is mostly up to the creator. But when you're in these spaces,

343
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:42,063
right, like you can actually totally help with that. So, I

344
00:18:42,103 --> 00:18:45,986
mean, maybe it's pooling together for a booth at GamerX.

345
00:18:46,486 --> 00:18:51,091
Maybe it's just exchanging some information or saying the latest, greatest tips on showing your game at IndieCade.

346
00:18:51,471 --> 00:18:54,514
Or maybe it's all having like, at this case, like a GameNest booth.

347
00:18:54,914 --> 00:18:58,057
Where people at a play-crafting event, you know, could come and be giving you feedback.

348
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:59,879
It's just easier to organize that stuff.

349
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:04,043
And you're actually helping make games get better with feedback and everything else in between, right?

350
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:05,104
And get the word out, of course.

351
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:12,132
Yeah, so, all right, great. You have this wonderful spot, you've organized a bunch of people,

352
00:19:12,592 --> 00:19:16,754
you came up with all your startup costs, and you have all these great engaged members.

353
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:22,057
Next thing to do is survive. And there's a bunch of unexpected stuff, like

354
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,479
IKEA couches don't fit in Honda Civics. Who knew?

355
00:19:27,724 --> 00:19:33,927
But on a more serious note, actually one of the big things that we deal with is security

356
00:19:35,668 --> 00:19:37,329
and access to the space.

357
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,970
So there's a couple different ways you can approach those things.

358
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:44,651
One of the cheapest ways to do it is just to give your members keys.

359
00:19:45,052 --> 00:19:50,514
That presents a lot of problems, though, in that people lose keys, people leave and they

360
00:19:50,534 --> 00:19:53,595
don't return them, and all of a sudden there's a bunch of security holes.

361
00:19:54,115 --> 00:19:58,977
And at GameNest, in your co-working space, you will probably be a target.

362
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:05,439
You're asking your members to leave their valuable, expensive laptops, tablets, all

363
00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:10,321
the stuff that game development requires in your space, and other people will want that.

364
00:20:11,747 --> 00:20:13,889
So you just have to be aware of those things.

365
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:19,195
For us, what we did is we got a 24-hour access card reader.

366
00:20:19,996 --> 00:20:21,537
And that was surprisingly difficult to get.

367
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:25,061
We had to have somebody come out from a company, and it

368
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:27,603
took them about two months to come and install it, even

369
00:20:27,623 --> 00:20:29,065
though we're calling them pretty much every day.

370
00:20:29,105 --> 00:20:30,426
And we're like, I want to pay you money.

371
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:31,547
And they're like, eh, we don't care.

372
00:20:34,018 --> 00:20:34,999
So just be aware of that.

373
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:40,163
And every time that we've been broken into, you know, we've had to do more stuff and spend

374
00:20:40,203 --> 00:20:41,624
more money on security.

375
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:46,308
And the other thing that isn't necessarily surprising, but...

376
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:51,718
is maybe a little bit more of a factor than you might think, is stuff like dishes.

377
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:52,719
You know?

378
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,463
Like we have a cleaning service that comes in twice a week, and it pays, and it cleans

379
00:20:57,483 --> 00:21:02,788
the place, it does all of our kitchen, it does the bathrooms, that's all phenomenal.

380
00:21:02,848 --> 00:21:04,330
But what are those off days?

381
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,633
Like what happens when people like leave dishes in the sink?

382
00:21:07,673 --> 00:21:07,953
You know?

383
00:21:07,993 --> 00:21:08,714
Who cleans those?

384
00:21:08,794 --> 00:21:09,935
It's probably going to be you.

385
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:11,493
Just saying.

386
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:13,575
So, be prepared for all that.

387
00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:16,818
You know, or like random stuff that happens in construction.

388
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:20,142
This is a window that got broken in GameNest and that happened the first day that we moved

389
00:21:20,262 --> 00:21:22,424
in and it took us another two months to get it fixed.

390
00:21:23,105 --> 00:21:24,947
You know, just stuff is unexpected.

391
00:21:25,487 --> 00:21:30,072
But it might not even be unexpected due to cost, it might be unexpected due to time.

392
00:21:30,572 --> 00:21:35,175
The other thing that I didn't realize about my co-working space is that all the lights are different sizes.

393
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:37,036
And they're all different wattages.

394
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:41,499
And so I'd go to Lowe's and I'd think I'd have all the information I need to buy my stupid light bulbs.

395
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:46,381
Well, guess what? I had to go back and forth to Lowe's like five times in a day.

396
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:52,905
It took an entire day's worth of time when I'm trying to get this co-working space up and running to get light bulbs.

397
00:21:54,973 --> 00:22:02,057
And as much as I love my members, sometimes people do stuff that you'd probably prefer

398
00:22:02,097 --> 00:22:02,758
them not to do.

399
00:22:03,478 --> 00:22:07,400
So you also have to talk through those things with them.

400
00:22:07,981 --> 00:22:08,921
A good way to do that...

401
00:22:10,144 --> 00:22:14,371
is we have weekly founder meetings where we all touch base with each other, we talk

402
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:18,978
about issues in the space, we get ahead of problems, we also have a slack that everybody

403
00:22:19,078 --> 00:22:20,040
in our space is on.

404
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,725
So if things come up and things are issues, we can know about them right away because

405
00:22:23,765 --> 00:22:25,528
it's better to deal with stuff proactively.

406
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:32,830
And then I guess one of the last things that was a positive surprise, there are some I swear,

407
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:39,111
was I underestimated how valuable Gameness would be as an event space.

408
00:22:39,952 --> 00:22:44,593
So we've had companies, and you'll have a great bunch of indies who are excited,

409
00:22:45,053 --> 00:22:47,654
and you'll probably have companies reach out to you and be like,

410
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:51,215
hey, can I host a launch party here? Can I do a developer event?

411
00:22:51,595 --> 00:22:55,596
And you should say yes. That is excellent. They paid for my couch.

412
00:22:57,597 --> 00:22:59,258
And you'll find your own surprises too.

413
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:01,899
And I encourage you to do so.

414
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,440
Definitely.

415
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,922
I definitely undercharge some game corporations sometimes to have fun events there.

416
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:10,684
So, most of all, it's just go for it.

417
00:23:11,304 --> 00:23:14,426
When we started this, we had no idea how to run an indie game co-working space.

418
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:16,427
So ask questions.

419
00:23:16,847 --> 00:23:18,268
Again, just go for it.

420
00:23:18,348 --> 00:23:21,150
And seriously, if you have any questions...

421
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,432
Just send us a note, right? Send anybody a note.

422
00:23:23,472 --> 00:23:25,335
Hit us up on Twitter, whatever is best for you.

423
00:23:25,755 --> 00:23:30,682
And most of all, we're definitely looking forward to seeing all these brand new indie game coworking spaces.

424
00:23:30,762 --> 00:23:33,886
So, thank you again, everybody. Seriously. Yeah, cheers.
