1
00:00:07,254 --> 00:00:08,054
Hey, everybody.

2
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:11,755
This is the first

3
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:15,356
Game Developers Conference podcast live.

4
00:00:15,656 --> 00:00:21,297
I am Chris Graft, editor-in-chief of Gamasutra, and I'm here with Alyssa.

5
00:00:21,317 --> 00:00:22,678
Hi, I'm Alyssa.

6
00:00:22,758 --> 00:00:27,659
I'm the news editor and associate publisher at Gamasutra, and I'm really weirded out by doing this on video.

7
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:28,519
It's really weird.

8
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:35,162
Yeah, yeah, it is. It is weird. We don't usually like we see each other, you know, just like

9
00:00:35,222 --> 00:00:41,463
in meetings and stuff like that. But now I'm it's it's like I'm actually talking to you.

10
00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:48,904
And the art of like face to face conversations is it's rusty for me.

11
00:00:48,944 --> 00:00:56,246
Let's just talk each other through it. Yeah. So so this is actually episode 12 of the podcast.

12
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,526
So that means that's like.

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,622
It's like one and we do one a month.

14
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,244
It's like one year.

15
00:01:01,284 --> 00:01:01,925
For a year.

16
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:06,529
Like this is one year of one year of podcasting.

17
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,894
So let's just let's just do the hey, how's your show going?

18
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:12,443
It's going great.

19
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,265
I've been very busy.

20
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:18,748
It's amazing that an online event can kind of capture that same kind of like I'm constantly

21
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:21,570
behind feeling as the regular GDC does for me.

22
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:26,814
I'm bad at scheduling, so it's on me, but like it's about the same kind of like heart

23
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:27,675
rate throughout.

24
00:01:27,735 --> 00:01:29,096
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:33,459
The thing too, though, is that if you're running late for something, it's not like, oh, I'm

26
00:01:33,499 --> 00:01:36,361
in Moscone West and I need to be in South.

27
00:01:36,962 --> 00:01:38,463
You don't have to power log up an escalator.

28
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:44,284
Yeah, yeah, and then show up at like the session completely like sweaty and stuff.

29
00:01:44,665 --> 00:01:50,730
So although I'm getting a little sweaty from this, you know, but it's the anxiety of podcasting

30
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,511
live podcasting.

31
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:52,311
We can't edit this.

32
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:52,792
I don't know.

33
00:01:53,753 --> 00:01:54,213
Right, right.

34
00:01:54,413 --> 00:01:55,274
Yeah, this is edit.

35
00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:56,255
This is edit free.

36
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:58,817
So if you ever listen to GDC podcast on.

37
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:05,434
iTunes, Spotify, and YouTube when we feel like it.

38
00:02:05,914 --> 00:02:12,537
Google Play. You can go check us out there. But yeah, you'll find out just how much editing

39
00:02:13,578 --> 00:02:18,040
goes into this. No, we always 100% flawlessly execute our sentences.

40
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:25,803
Oh yeah, yeah. Sorry. It's always first take. So I'm also noticing this, that there are people

41
00:02:25,883 --> 00:02:27,764
in chat, which I didn't even consider.

42
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:30,179
that in the Swapcard app.

43
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:31,140
Hello, everyone.

44
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,461
This is totally a recording.

45
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:35,622
No, it's not really.

46
00:02:36,162 --> 00:02:37,243
This is actually live.

47
00:02:37,803 --> 00:02:39,404
So hello, everybody in chat.

48
00:02:39,544 --> 00:02:40,844
This is totally new for us.

49
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:43,305
Thanks for coming on here.

50
00:02:43,325 --> 00:02:47,888
Yeah, I'll try not to look at that too much.

51
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:51,449
So we actually have an amazing guest here.

52
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:52,270
Do you think that we should?

53
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,621
We have no GDC announcements to do because GDC is a bomb.

54
00:02:56,681 --> 00:02:58,121
So we can get right to the meat.

55
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:00,442
No, there's no morning announcements this time.

56
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:04,743
So we can just, it's like, yeah, we got you here.

57
00:03:05,584 --> 00:03:07,844
The content marketing worked.

58
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:09,685
Let the content reign.

59
00:03:09,705 --> 00:03:10,645
Let's introduce a guest.

60
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:12,166
The marketing is done.

61
00:03:12,186 --> 00:03:15,327
And now the content reigns.

62
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:15,867
OK.

63
00:03:16,307 --> 00:03:16,968
Now here we are.

64
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:19,208
We do have a guest.

65
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:20,909
And we're excited.

66
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:22,670
So I'm going to.

67
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:24,874
To introduce here.

68
00:03:24,994 --> 00:03:25,975
So you're ready.

69
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:28,677
No, let's do it live.

70
00:03:29,097 --> 00:03:35,201
OK, our next guest is lead games user researcher at the Able Gamers Charity.

71
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:38,263
He has a bachelor's in psychology.

72
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:39,784
I don't have that.

73
00:03:40,865 --> 00:03:44,387
Was a research assistant in the Lever Center for Schizophrenia

74
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:48,330
at the New York State Psychiatric Institute for six years.

75
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:49,931
That's a mouthful.

76
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:52,653
And it sounds prestigious.

77
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:58,433
He's an advocate for accessibility in the game industry,

78
00:03:58,493 --> 00:04:00,894
and he's led talks, workshops, and consultations

79
00:04:00,934 --> 00:04:03,356
with tech companies that you might have heard of.

80
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:08,678
Google, Oculus, Avalanche, Activision,

81
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,080
and there's also Microsoft, where he worked.

82
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,982
He did some consulting on the Xbox Adaptive Controller,

83
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:17,002
which is a super cool thing.

84
00:04:18,243 --> 00:04:22,825
So let's go ahead and bring him on right about.

85
00:04:23,877 --> 00:04:26,799
Now and unmuted, let's welcome Greg Haynes.

86
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:30,442
That was an intro and a half.

87
00:04:30,462 --> 00:04:32,444
Like, I don't even know what to say after that.

88
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:33,985
I should just like leave right now.

89
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:36,486
Thank you so much for that intro. That was great.

90
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:38,128
Thank you so much for joining us.

91
00:04:38,488 --> 00:04:39,849
That's what we like to do.

92
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:42,411
All the fanfare right away.

93
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:43,432
Poppers in the background.

94
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:48,403
Yeah, yeah. And then just bring the person on and just make them super,

95
00:04:48,423 --> 00:04:49,684
deeper humble. Yes.

96
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:51,805
Yes. All right.

97
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,207
It goes expanding as we speak.

98
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:56,029
I know you seem very cocky.

99
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:57,930
Did we miss any notable achievements?

100
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,192
Anything else you want to kind of brag about a little bit?

101
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:02,955
I mean, I think you got it outside of my Social Security number.

102
00:05:02,975 --> 00:05:04,476
I think you got my entire history.

103
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:05,497
Oh yeah, what is that then?

104
00:05:06,658 --> 00:05:08,019
The closing comments, yeah.

105
00:05:09,937 --> 00:05:15,202
All right, so, like, accessibility, that's a topic in games now.

106
00:05:15,222 --> 00:05:16,363
It's a very important one.

107
00:05:17,124 --> 00:05:21,589
You personally, what prompted your interest in game accessibility?

108
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:23,330
Why are you such a big advocate for that?

109
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,764
Um, that's a really, that's a really interesting question.

110
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:31,087
Um, I mean, for starters, uh, just coming out of the, uh, the, the

111
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:36,010
farmer research realm, I really wanted to combine my love for gaming and my

112
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:39,692
love for psychology and, and helping people essentially find wellbeing

113
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:41,633
through, um, gaming experiences.

114
00:05:42,413 --> 00:05:46,256
Uh, and, uh, I happened to meet, uh, the, uh, the founder and executive

115
00:05:46,276 --> 00:05:47,537
director, uh, Mark Barlet.

116
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:51,075
And our director of community, Craig Kaufman,

117
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:54,840
had a convention a few years ago, and we just hit it off.

118
00:05:55,461 --> 00:05:57,724
And when they were talking to me about game accessibility,

119
00:05:58,004 --> 00:05:59,045
I was like, this is it.

120
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,809
This is the way that I can combine those two loves.

121
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,802
At the end of the day, knowing how important games are to me

122
00:06:07,102 --> 00:06:11,044
and seeing the impact that gaming has made on my life

123
00:06:11,144 --> 00:06:12,525
and the connections I've been able to make,

124
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:16,687
whether it was content creation or making lifelong friends,

125
00:06:17,867 --> 00:06:20,569
I felt that if there's a community out there that's

126
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:22,810
unable to experience that for whatever reason,

127
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,391
and I can change that somehow, then it

128
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:30,693
was my duty and my calling, if you will, to indulge that.

129
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:35,928
I didn't get into it in your intro, but how long have you been with AbleGamers now?

130
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,471
I've been with AbleGamers since the beginning of 2018.

131
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:41,533
Since the beginning of 2018. So, two years?

132
00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:44,175
You've done a lot in only a couple years.

133
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:48,379
I mean, you have to factor in pandemic time too, so it's been roughly 15 years.

134
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:54,444
Yeah, I'm running up on my pension right now. It's looking good.

135
00:06:54,684 --> 00:06:55,624
Looking good for your board.

136
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:56,585
Well done.

137
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:04,441
Before we get more into it, you know, there is a lot of talk about accessibility in games,

138
00:07:04,621 --> 00:07:10,225
but it's kind of a word that's thrown around a lot and maybe not everybody quite understands

139
00:07:10,325 --> 00:07:16,248
what it means. So as an expert in this field, what does accessibility mean to you? How do you define

140
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:27,343
Oh, you know, I think accessibility that you're right, because there's definitely you definitely see accessibility using the context of like, is this game something that the consumer will enjoy?

141
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:38,491
But in terms of game accessibility, and essentially opening up the the gaming sphere for people with disabilities, we're talking about being able to remove barriers to play.

142
00:07:39,532 --> 00:07:44,536
For anyone, right? It's not even just people with disabilities, anyone who might have a barrier to play.

143
00:07:46,097 --> 00:07:48,739
And it goes from being able to boot up a game

144
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:51,040
and being able to just interact with the game.

145
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,442
And we'll talk more about that later.

146
00:07:53,502 --> 00:07:55,624
And also being able to encounter the challenges

147
00:07:56,505 --> 00:07:58,066
that you encounter in a game and being

148
00:07:58,106 --> 00:08:00,007
able to surpass those challenges to make progress,

149
00:08:00,808 --> 00:08:03,049
to ultimately have a fulfilling experience, an experience

150
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:03,810
that you want to have.

151
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:07,253
So I guess in short, game accessibility

152
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:10,475
is really being able to break down the barriers to play

153
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:13,437
as you engage with these game worlds

154
00:08:13,477 --> 00:08:14,918
that creators are creating.

155
00:08:16,894 --> 00:08:20,618
I feel like I'm stealing this phrasing from somewhere I read recently, but there's like

156
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:23,941
the idea that game design is like creating barriers for people.

157
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,325
This might have been like something I read in your bio and then just like repurposing

158
00:08:27,365 --> 00:08:27,405
it.

159
00:08:27,445 --> 00:08:32,290
But like, so how do you kind of coach people through or work with like devs who are think

160
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,353
accessibility might be at odds with like creating challenge or something along the way?

161
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,804
Yeah, that's a huge, huge issue.

162
00:08:38,824 --> 00:08:42,046
Because what you're talking about there is like the perception of game difficulty.

163
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:42,926
Right. Yeah.

164
00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:45,828
You know, we've seen that debate play out time and time again

165
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:48,889
just in the past few years of like, what makes this game like?

166
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:50,290
I want to make this game hard.

167
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,031
Like, is it does that mean it's not accessible?

168
00:08:53,092 --> 00:08:57,434
And there's there's sort of a misconception, I think, within the community

169
00:08:58,354 --> 00:09:02,837
that anybody asking for accessible features wants their game to be easy.

170
00:09:03,698 --> 00:09:09,985
And I think that's sort of a disservice to the experience that anybody who plays the game wants to have.

171
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:16,512
And that's that we all, including people with disabilities, including what I've seen in the research that we've done with AbleGamers,

172
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:20,177
the disabled community does want...

173
00:09:20,837 --> 00:09:26,103
challenge in their games. They don't want their games to be easy per se, but challenge is relative,

174
00:09:26,303 --> 00:09:31,729
right? Like what's hard for me might not be hard for you, right? So at the end of the day, it's

175
00:09:31,969 --> 00:09:35,353
being able to tune the challenges that they encounter in games in order to be able to

176
00:09:35,393 --> 00:09:37,375
surpass those barriers and again to make progress.

177
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:52,363
So when it comes to game difficulty, you know, simply, you know, talking about easy mode or, you know, having a mode that's, you know, explorer mode or whatever it may be, it's not the entirety of the conversation.

178
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:53,544
It could be part of it.

179
00:09:54,144 --> 00:09:56,706
But I think game difficulty and challenge really,

180
00:09:57,546 --> 00:09:59,688
really amounts to having the options

181
00:09:59,848 --> 00:10:01,549
to tune challenge to the way you need it to be.

182
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:03,390
So that you're getting the right amount of,

183
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,232
I guess, resistance to your progress,

184
00:10:06,392 --> 00:10:08,593
but not so that it's just this thing

185
00:10:08,613 --> 00:10:09,634
that you're not able to enjoy.

186
00:10:09,814 --> 00:10:12,815
Because what's unique to games versus like,

187
00:10:13,076 --> 00:10:14,557
let's say like web accessibility, right?

188
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:16,998
Like web accessibility, you don't want interaction

189
00:10:17,018 --> 00:10:18,539
with the website to be hard, right?

190
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,161
When you jump on amazon.com, you don't wanna be,

191
00:10:21,261 --> 00:10:22,681
you know, and you put like, I don't know, like,

192
00:10:23,896 --> 00:10:26,979
Anything in your cart. I'm going to say Capri Suns because I was just talking about that today.

193
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:27,379
Yeah.

194
00:10:27,479 --> 00:10:29,241
Capri Suns. Let's get out of my cart.

195
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:32,244
I don't want to challenge when I order some Capri Suns.

196
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:36,548
I don't want like an Amazon, you know, a Gremlin to pop out.

197
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:38,149
Well, then maybe you're not a true gamer.

198
00:10:40,934 --> 00:10:44,197
We laugh about it, but that's kind of the argument that's out there, right?

199
00:10:44,217 --> 00:10:48,701
Which is, you know, you're not a gamer if you don't want some sort of challenge.

200
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:50,302
And at the end of the day, it's relative.

201
00:10:50,342 --> 00:10:51,443
Some people want different things.

202
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:54,466
And what we're talking about when we talk about, like, game accessibility

203
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:58,309
in the context of challenges, being able to create the environment,

204
00:10:58,349 --> 00:10:59,870
the challenge environment that you want to create.

205
00:11:00,251 --> 00:11:01,532
And that doesn't mean that.

206
00:11:02,032 --> 00:11:05,174
The current means of game difficulty don't exist, right?

207
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:08,796
Like, you can still have your hardest hardcore modes,

208
00:11:08,856 --> 00:11:11,518
but how I play doesn't affect how the next person plays

209
00:11:11,558 --> 00:11:13,158
and how the person after that plays.

210
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,600
So in terms of coaching, you know,

211
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,302
through coaching developers in terms of the conversation

212
00:11:19,342 --> 00:11:21,963
around difficulty, it's really about presenting options

213
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,364
for people.

214
00:11:23,644 --> 00:11:27,446
You know, it's, we kind of have this concept in the community

215
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:29,568
where, you know, people want to marshal over the way

216
00:11:29,608 --> 00:11:30,288
other people play.

217
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:31,008
And it's like...

218
00:11:32,065 --> 00:11:34,926
You know, are you in my house playing the game?

219
00:11:35,147 --> 00:11:38,629
Like, what how do you what does it matter to you how playing the game now?

220
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:42,771
Again, when you're talking about things like multiplayer, right,

221
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:45,393
like that's where something where, you know, you might think, well,

222
00:11:45,493 --> 00:11:48,915
what if it's easy for this person and I'm playing on the hardest mode or whatever?

223
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:51,657
And I'm like, well, there's there's optional matchmaking.

224
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:55,019
There's things where and we call that house rules in the able gamers community.

225
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:58,942
You know, where you can tune the rules for online engagements

226
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:01,965
that you're playing with other people who want to play the same way that you want to play.

227
00:12:02,886 --> 00:12:06,149
So there's definitely a multitude of answers for something like that.

228
00:12:06,169 --> 00:12:08,691
But I think I think game difficulty is a contentious

229
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:10,874
conversation to have.

230
00:12:11,154 --> 00:12:14,097
And yeah, you know, it's one of those things where it's

231
00:12:14,117 --> 00:12:15,378
like let people game the way they want to game.

232
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,801
Do you think it's fair to put it like this,

233
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:25,485
like it's about giving access to a wide range of people

234
00:12:25,965 --> 00:12:30,467
with different abilities, giving them access to the challenges

235
00:12:30,587 --> 00:12:33,609
that the game designers intended?

236
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,290
Question mark?

237
00:12:38,502 --> 00:12:42,782
I mean, it's not, I don't think, again, you know, I don't think game developers need to

238
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:44,683
change their vision per se, right?

239
00:12:44,783 --> 00:12:45,003
What?

240
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:47,864
Yeah, that's, yeah, that's what I mean.

241
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:49,024
That's exactly what you're saying, right?

242
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:52,665
Like you can keep the same world that you want to create, just allow people to tune

243
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:53,945
the elements of it that they want.

244
00:12:54,085 --> 00:12:58,046
Because ultimately, if you know, we look at the current landscape of game difficulty,

245
00:12:58,086 --> 00:12:58,246
right?

246
00:12:58,686 --> 00:13:01,706
Let's say you have your standard easy, medium, hard, right?

247
00:13:02,487 --> 00:13:05,087
If I want to play it on hard mode, I'm going to play it on hard mode.

248
00:13:05,107 --> 00:13:06,768
If you're going to play on easy mode, you're going to play on easy mode.

249
00:13:07,148 --> 00:13:08,668
And the interesting thing about it is,

250
00:13:09,128 --> 00:13:11,109
I always kind of talk to people about this, which is,

251
00:13:11,969 --> 00:13:13,169
as a gaming community, as a community,

252
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:16,390
we accept whatever definitions a developer has determined

253
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,091
for easy, medium, hard.

254
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:19,591
We accept it outright.

255
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:21,912
We just choose one of those and we just go with it.

256
00:13:22,472 --> 00:13:25,092
And we don't really question what that is.

257
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:28,853
Because easy in one game isn't necessarily easy in another game.

258
00:13:29,444 --> 00:13:31,065
You know, there are different factors at play.

259
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:37,789
And what we're asking you is really to have the ability to edit those things.

260
00:13:37,809 --> 00:13:42,552
Like you see like sliders in games like The Last of Us Part II

261
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:44,593
had difficulty sliders or challenge sliders.

262
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:49,515
Tomb Raider is another franchise that lately has been doing those difficulty sliders

263
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:52,097
that allow people to tune what aspects of the game

264
00:13:52,117 --> 00:13:54,318
they want to be more difficult or less challenging.

265
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:58,641
And ultimately, like it again, if you want to default to easy.

266
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:01,927
Medium hard, which those modes also which those games also have.

267
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:05,795
They also have those default modes that are developer sort of determined.

268
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:08,480
You could jump into that and you can play those modes if you want.

269
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,683
But if you want.

270
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,682
the other way of going about it, then you can do that too.

271
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:19,945
And as a community, like we all like we always see talks about options.

272
00:14:20,185 --> 00:14:22,326
Like we all want options, consumer options.

273
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:24,327
Like it is consumer friendly.

274
00:14:24,688 --> 00:14:28,170
And frankly, it's good usability to give a user options

275
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:30,651
in terms of how they want to engage with the content you're presenting.

276
00:14:31,058 --> 00:14:35,163
No one's going to be hurt by having more options and more ways to choose how they want their experience to be.

277
00:14:36,024 --> 00:14:38,928
Except the so-called marshals that I mentioned earlier.

278
00:14:38,948 --> 00:14:42,112
People that are trying to govern how I want to interact with the game.

279
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:46,383
This is kind of like what you guys have done with the accessible that games.

280
00:14:46,443 --> 00:14:47,544
Is there a fancier name for that?

281
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:48,645
Probably that I'm getting wrong.

282
00:14:48,986 --> 00:14:50,627
No, that's that's the name of the site.

283
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:52,029
It's a really cool portal.

284
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:54,492
I covered it when you guys launched it at first.

285
00:14:54,512 --> 00:14:57,015
And there's just like so much like free accessible information

286
00:14:57,055 --> 00:15:00,999
about accessibility there and how does can like roll that into their games.

287
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,001
How involved were you in the creation of that?

288
00:15:03,061 --> 00:15:03,942
Is it like your baby or?

289
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:06,166
Uh, is it my baby?

290
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:10,993
Um, wow. Now we're getting into legality and child support questions.

291
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:15,320
Uh, I mean, it is, you know, it is our team's baby.

292
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,602
Did I have a role in it?

293
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:22,936
Yes, I had a very big part in Accessible.games, including the Accessible Player Experience

294
00:15:22,976 --> 00:15:30,240
Design Tool that we created. It's based on user research, based on this program. Research from

295
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,463
this program we have called Player Panels, which is an assemblage of people with disabilities,

296
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:37,724
players with disabilities, who have provided feedback about

297
00:15:38,545 --> 00:15:58,734
The way they want to play your games and we turn those into to design patterns that speak a lot about what I'm speaking about right now and where it operates on an access level, which is getting people around what's called the the player feedback loop. So basically, access barriers stop people from interacting with the game and taking out information from the game.

298
00:15:59,414 --> 00:15:59,514
And.

299
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,395
Access solutions would help you navigate those barriers.

300
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:05,316
And then on the second level, challenge,

301
00:16:06,036 --> 00:16:07,996
which is essentially what I mentioned earlier,

302
00:16:08,196 --> 00:16:09,817
helping people progress through the game,

303
00:16:09,897 --> 00:16:14,257
helping people not just encounter some of the challenges

304
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:15,838
they might have in combat or progression,

305
00:16:16,178 --> 00:16:17,758
but also emotional challenges, right?

306
00:16:17,798 --> 00:16:19,618
Like sometimes there might be content

307
00:16:19,658 --> 00:16:20,599
that you can't engage with.

308
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:23,999
A great example of that is you see gore settings in games.

309
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:26,580
You see games that sometimes allow you

310
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,020
to turn off mature language.

311
00:16:29,713 --> 00:16:34,209
So anything on that level operates in the challenge sphere and anything that.

312
00:16:35,254 --> 00:16:39,155
allows people to get through that cycle, get through that player feedback loop,

313
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:42,737
and subsequently progress through the game is what we would call an accessible player experience.

314
00:16:43,457 --> 00:16:48,579
So all of that is on accessible.games, including anyone who might have a disability who plays

315
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:52,580
games who wants to be part of the Player Funnels program. Currently we have registration halted

316
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:58,563
due to COVID-19, but we usually have a portal there for people to be able to register and sign

317
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,584
up for that program, which is currently sitting at about 600 players.

318
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:03,437
And right now, thank you.

319
00:17:03,997 --> 00:17:06,279
And right now in the works, we have a research portal

320
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,040
that we're trying to set up that'll

321
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,361
show some of the research studies

322
00:17:09,381 --> 00:17:10,662
that we've already come out with.

323
00:17:11,082 --> 00:17:12,543
Just have it housed there in one spot

324
00:17:12,563 --> 00:17:14,725
so that any developer can come and check out

325
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:15,505
some of the work we've done.

326
00:17:16,886 --> 00:17:21,610
I do want to go over here and look at chat real quick,

327
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:26,253
because some people are using the question function.

328
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,955
And yeah, let's ask this one.

329
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:32,929
from Misha Samaridan.

330
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:35,530
And sorry if I pronounced that incorrectly.

331
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,971
How much do you advocate for accessibility

332
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:41,072
with people with autism and Asperger's?

333
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:43,132
Is there funding opportunities

334
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:46,613
for those wanting to create experiences for this audience?

335
00:17:46,654 --> 00:17:47,974
Do you have any insight on that, Greg?

336
00:17:48,914 --> 00:17:50,535
So just so I'm clear,

337
00:17:51,315 --> 00:17:53,716
funding opportunities for anyone wanting to do development

338
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:56,977
for neurodiverse folks.

339
00:17:57,337 --> 00:17:57,937
And what was the other part?

340
00:17:57,957 --> 00:17:58,858
What was the first part of the question?

341
00:18:00,302 --> 00:18:06,089
How much do you advocate for accessibility for those types of situations?

342
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:19,827
Sure. So, I mean, you know, at the end of the day, you know, we kind of have to get to a point where we're respecting and acknowledging both the physical side of disabilities and also the cognitive and mental side of disabilities as well.

343
00:18:20,587 --> 00:18:32,010
So I very much, we very much advocate for not just addressing some of the physical barriers that people might have to play, but also some of the cognitive barriers, some of the mental health barriers that folks have to play.

344
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,551
You know, we were speaking about challenge.

345
00:18:34,851 --> 00:18:39,812
A lot of the sort of interactional barriers that get in the way of progress usually happen

346
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:44,393
for a lot of folks who, you know, have mental health difficulties or are neurodiverse.

347
00:18:44,413 --> 00:18:48,734
People with physical disabilities experience that as well, but that is something that certainly

348
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:55,216
operates for folks who have, you know, those mental difficulties as well as access issues,

349
00:18:55,236 --> 00:18:55,396
too.

350
00:18:55,476 --> 00:18:58,817
Sometimes, you know, you're looking at a game, you're just like, there's too much information

351
00:18:58,857 --> 00:18:58,977
here.

352
00:18:59,657 --> 00:19:06,299
You know, I might have a learning disability and I might need to turn off some of the information because it's coming at me too much. It's too much coming at me at once.

353
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:13,040
So I think, very much so we should, we should keep in mind that it's not just about people who have physical disabilities.

354
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:23,182
It's also about folks who, you know, maybe have a disability that you can't physically, you know, see or comprehend without talking to them.

355
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:34,826
In terms of funding opportunities, that's a really great question. I don't personally know if there are any funding opportunities, like grants, I assume the person is talking about.

356
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:41,208
I don't think there, I don't know if there are any funding opportunities in that respect. That's not really my area of expertise.

357
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:49,751
But, you know, I can say that, you know, there's a sizable population of people with mental health difficulties that could benefit from games.

358
00:19:51,207 --> 00:19:52,628
being more inclusive in that respect.

359
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:56,909
And that's even a population that's

360
00:19:56,949 --> 00:19:58,389
represented in our Play Panels program,

361
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:02,010
because it's important for us to cover

362
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,431
the full landscape of disability, which

363
00:20:05,511 --> 00:20:08,071
is very much inclusive of people who

364
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:10,712
have neurodiverse diagnoses and mental health conditions.

365
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:15,553
Now, if I'm a small game developer,

366
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:17,533
I don't have a lot of time and resources.

367
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:17,834
But.

368
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:24,433
And I'm just like, you know what, accessibility just isn't a priority for me.

369
00:20:25,134 --> 00:20:28,939
Do you have, you know, an argument, you know, that that counters that?

370
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:36,230
Yeah, I mean, that's one of those tough ones where you hear you kind of rage inside

371
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:36,791
because it's like.

372
00:20:37,979 --> 00:20:40,540
There's always time, you know what I mean?

373
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,202
I mean, but I understand where they're coming from.

374
00:20:43,502 --> 00:20:47,164
And to that I'll say, that's part of the work that,

375
00:20:47,364 --> 00:20:48,825
as an organization, we're trying to do.

376
00:20:49,725 --> 00:20:51,986
Where we're trying to inform the community

377
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:55,088
about ways that they can move accessibility

378
00:20:55,148 --> 00:20:57,129
to the earlier stages of development.

379
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:00,831
The Accessible Player Experience design patterns

380
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:03,652
that I mentioned earlier, they're available for free

381
00:21:03,932 --> 00:21:05,013
on accessible.game.com.

382
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:08,798
It's something that you can view freely.

383
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:12,220
And what it does is it presents accessibility problems

384
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,941
that people might encounter in a problem solution format.

385
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:22,023
So let's say, for example, we have a design pattern called second channel, right?

386
00:21:22,043 --> 00:21:26,224
So one of the problems or the problem for second channel is people can't take

387
00:21:26,284 --> 00:21:29,105
in the information you're trying to relay to them

388
00:21:29,486 --> 00:21:31,966
through the particular modality that you've chosen, right?

389
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:33,649
So that's a lot of words.

390
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:35,652
And when you hear that, you're like, what is this dude talking about?

391
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:40,980
But a great example might be like the information in the cutscene, right?

392
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,005
Let's say like, you know, voiceovers in a cutscene, right?

393
00:21:44,546 --> 00:21:45,608
So that's one modality.

394
00:21:45,628 --> 00:21:47,110
You're presenting a cutscene visually.

395
00:21:48,151 --> 00:21:54,015
And you're presenting the audio in that cutscene through, you know, one means, audio channel.

396
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:58,098
So a way to articulate a cutscene, or at least the dialogue coming from a cutscene,

397
00:21:58,438 --> 00:22:01,580
another modality or channel would be to have subtitling.

398
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:06,063
That way, there's now a visual modality in addition to that audio modality.

399
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,534
You know, when we're talking about visual, sometimes we'll see some game trailers.

400
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:15,337
Like Everwild, I think, had a game trailer where it was completely in audio descriptions.

401
00:22:15,777 --> 00:22:20,420
So, like, the trailer was presented visually, but the whole thing was audio described.

402
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,742
So, someone who has a visual disability could perceive the entire thing,

403
00:22:25,422 --> 00:22:26,783
you know, from that perspective.

404
00:22:27,423 --> 00:22:32,126
So, what those design patterns do is they identify a problem like that,

405
00:22:32,186 --> 00:22:33,707
and they present a solution, which is present.

406
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:54,052
information through additional modalities. So by tuning a developer's thought processes that way, it helps them think about game mechanics that they might want to implement their game early on. And some of the barriers or problems that people with disabilities might encounter. So the idea there is you're able to think about

407
00:22:54,908 --> 00:23:10,338
disability, while without thinking about specific diagnoses, right, you're able to come out a few levels and think, okay, how might someone who has a visual disability deal with this feature that I'm including this game? How might somebody within auditory disability

408
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:16,001
encounter this feature that I have in the game? How about a physical disability, and so on and so forth. Um,

409
00:23:17,136 --> 00:23:26,641
So that was really important to us to be able to create this resource because currently a lot of the industry's guideline focus and guidelines aren't they're not a bad thing.

410
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:31,124
They're really useful for checking once you've created a game right.

411
00:23:31,164 --> 00:23:35,406
Like it's really helpful to be like OK I've got this feature check checkmark.

412
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:35,887
It's great.

413
00:23:36,507 --> 00:23:36,687
But.

414
00:23:38,034 --> 00:23:45,577
The difficulty with guidelines is they don't really tell you how to do it or how to do it well, right?

415
00:23:45,617 --> 00:23:48,838
They don't tell you how you're supposed to implement a feature, just tells you that you should have it.

416
00:23:49,158 --> 00:23:54,360
There are best practices that are, you know, guidelines can be inclusive of, but ultimately.

417
00:23:55,449 --> 00:23:57,310
They get so robust, right?

418
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,051
Like, you know, current guidelines right now, like they say that,

419
00:24:00,632 --> 00:24:02,893
you know, we're talking about dozens and dozens of options

420
00:24:03,334 --> 00:24:05,715
that you have to make sure are in your game

421
00:24:05,835 --> 00:24:07,816
without telling you how to input that.

422
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:11,058
It becomes more of like a checklist than like design decisions at that point

423
00:24:11,098 --> 00:24:11,919
is what it sounds like.

424
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:30,363
Right, exactly. So with with APX and the way that we're trying to shift design thinking is we're trying to think of the person first versus the versus the technology we're trying to put the human being first. Um, and essentially with with APX, you're thinking about problems or barriers that people might encounter. And

425
00:24:31,957 --> 00:24:33,477
In the process of developing your game,

426
00:24:33,837 --> 00:24:35,978
thinking about solutions that help you ideate,

427
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:37,919
but don't tell you how to design your game.

428
00:24:38,499 --> 00:24:40,660
It tells you what barriers people might encounter

429
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,621
and allows developers to think reflexively, right?

430
00:24:43,721 --> 00:24:46,683
And ultimately, what it does is it encourages

431
00:24:46,743 --> 00:24:47,523
generative design.

432
00:24:48,624 --> 00:24:50,824
So in terms of smaller developers,

433
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:52,985
that's sort of one aspect of it.

434
00:24:53,406 --> 00:24:55,726
The other aspect of it is the financial aspect of it.

435
00:24:56,974 --> 00:24:58,898
People with disabilities in the United States

436
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:02,827
have about $21 billion in discretionary income.

437
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:05,163
Right? That's like after they've paid their bills,

438
00:25:05,683 --> 00:25:07,683
and they're like, yo, this is party time money.

439
00:25:07,863 --> 00:25:08,504
What do I have?

440
00:25:09,064 --> 00:25:10,004
What can I spend it on?

441
00:25:10,184 --> 00:25:10,664
It's $21 billion.

442
00:25:10,864 --> 00:25:12,445
And to put that into perspective,

443
00:25:12,865 --> 00:25:14,245
that's more than the Black community

444
00:25:14,405 --> 00:25:15,626
and Hispanic communities combined.

445
00:25:15,926 --> 00:25:17,286
Black community has about $3 billion.

446
00:25:17,586 --> 00:25:19,247
The Hispanic community has about $16 billion

447
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:20,427
in discretionary income.

448
00:25:20,827 --> 00:25:22,808
So there's a financial factor to that as well.

449
00:25:23,348 --> 00:25:25,448
And with 46 million potential players

450
00:25:25,468 --> 00:25:26,809
with disabilities in the United States,

451
00:25:26,829 --> 00:25:28,629
you're talking about a huge player base

452
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:31,950
that you can tap into as a smaller developer.

453
00:25:33,091 --> 00:25:36,132
And there are other examples of independent developers,

454
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,573
including accessibility in their games.

455
00:25:38,593 --> 00:25:41,135
You know, you've got Celeste,

456
00:25:41,515 --> 00:25:44,776
Infernium, Way of the Passive Fist,

457
00:25:44,816 --> 00:25:47,558
Hypnospace Outlaw, HyperDot.

458
00:25:47,578 --> 00:25:51,700
There's like a bevy of games there now including that.

459
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,881
And ultimately, the industry is changing.

460
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:56,742
The industry is changing.

461
00:25:57,422 --> 00:25:59,904
And if you're not able to adapt,

462
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:01,825
people aren't going to be able to play your game.

463
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,801
And ultimately, you know, that's sort of the decision you have to make.

464
00:26:07,341 --> 00:26:10,142
And it's tough to think about it this way,

465
00:26:10,162 --> 00:26:12,643
but not every single game is always going to be accessible.

466
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:14,003
But we have to start somewhere.

467
00:26:14,563 --> 00:26:16,803
We have to start thinking about things like subtitling.

468
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:19,264
We have to start thinking about things like remapping,

469
00:26:19,304 --> 00:26:22,485
because as with all technologies, we have to start somewhere.

470
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:23,965
We have to start somewhere.

471
00:26:24,305 --> 00:26:26,926
And there are too many people being left out to not even think

472
00:26:27,426 --> 00:26:29,986
about starting somewhere so that we can ultimately progress

473
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:31,387
the industry to the place we need it to be.

474
00:26:32,565 --> 00:26:40,210
I know with The Last of Us Part 2 had like that amazing array of just accessibility options focused at so many different areas of need.

475
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:47,114
And they talked about how it started with the Uncharted game that I don't remember the number of prior to that.

476
00:26:47,194 --> 00:26:51,317
And they're like, oh, these are foundations we set up by building accessibility options into this game.

477
00:26:51,357 --> 00:26:54,459
And then we were able to iterate on them and just build their feedback.

478
00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:58,201
And just from already having those foundations lay, I just accelerate this into this really cool thing.

479
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:04,119
So just getting out there and doing even the basic so you can kind of learn and iterate

480
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,121
and do more later on seems to be beneficial.

481
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:28,816
Yeah, and you know, to that point, I mean, you know, we talked about the player panels program, which a developer is free to submit a project to player panels. If you need feedback from players with disabilities. Again, we have 600 players, you can submit a project to let them let us know what type of feedback you want to you want to get from your game. Only thing we ask is that those players are compensated for their time.

482
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,599
We have to set a minimum rate

483
00:27:32,299 --> 00:27:33,581
for the amount that players are paid.

484
00:27:33,621 --> 00:27:34,742
We don't take anything from that.

485
00:27:34,822 --> 00:27:36,903
It's completely you paying the players

486
00:27:36,944 --> 00:27:37,684
that are involved in it.

487
00:27:38,305 --> 00:27:40,427
And that minimum rate is,

488
00:27:40,907 --> 00:27:42,228
at minimum it's $10 for 20 minutes of work

489
00:27:42,248 --> 00:27:42,929
or $25 for an hour of work.

490
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:47,827
It's good that you guys pay people for stuff like that, because there's a lot, yeah.

491
00:27:47,847 --> 00:27:50,909
I mean, it's not even us paying them, it's the developer that can.

492
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:55,412
But you know, when it comes down to it, right, like, let's say you create a survey or a gameplay

493
00:27:55,832 --> 00:27:59,535
play session that's an hour long, and you're like, all right, you're like, I want to get

494
00:27:59,815 --> 00:28:04,018
10 people with disabilities to give me feedback on their gameplay experience, right?

495
00:28:04,898 --> 00:28:06,860
$25 times 10 people is $250. You're talking about $250 for accessibility feedback.

496
00:28:11,135 --> 00:28:12,036
At minimum, right?

497
00:28:12,056 --> 00:28:12,176
Yeah.

498
00:28:12,196 --> 00:28:16,858
Like, at the end of the day, and again, going back to the numbers I sent you before, you're

499
00:28:16,878 --> 00:28:19,779
talking about tapping into $21 billion of discretionary income.

500
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:25,521
So like, you can make a small investment now to make your game more accessible.

501
00:28:25,942 --> 00:28:26,082
Yeah.

502
00:28:26,102 --> 00:28:28,823
And ultimately you'll iterate and become better at that going forward.

503
00:28:29,563 --> 00:28:29,743
Right?

504
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:31,824
So, and again, the space is changing.

505
00:28:32,024 --> 00:28:33,945
Also, people our age, right?

506
00:28:33,965 --> 00:28:35,766
Like I don't know about you, but like I'm 30 years old.

507
00:28:35,786 --> 00:28:36,446
I want a game until like.

508
00:28:36,566 --> 00:28:37,486
I want a game until like.

509
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:41,252
Until like, the angels start singing for me.

510
00:28:41,272 --> 00:28:43,313
Like, I'm, hopefully angels.

511
00:28:44,954 --> 00:28:46,796
You know, hopefully that was a pitchfork.

512
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:50,198
But, you know, I'm trying to play for the rest of my life.

513
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:53,701
But we all know that as time progresses,

514
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:55,842
you have age-related disabilities, right?

515
00:28:56,323 --> 00:28:59,625
And even things that we don't often think about as disabilities, right?

516
00:28:59,685 --> 00:29:01,366
Your sight might go, right?

517
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:03,788
Maybe your reflexes aren't as good, right?

518
00:29:03,948 --> 00:29:07,171
We're a huge gaming generation.

519
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,300
When we're older, the industry,

520
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,061
we want the industry to be able to cater to us.

521
00:29:13,462 --> 00:29:16,584
I mean, I don't want to be Zoomers that take over the gaming space

522
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:17,745
and I'm like, hey, what about me?

523
00:29:17,785 --> 00:29:19,746
Like I'm a millennial. I'm trying to game too.

524
00:29:20,347 --> 00:29:21,908
Games are all I got. I'm broken.

525
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:23,329
I got debt. I need games.

526
00:29:23,349 --> 00:29:26,811
You know, so like it's important for us to think about accessibility

527
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:29,373
in that respect because the industry is changing.

528
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:31,054
Yeah. And I'm 40.

529
00:29:31,214 --> 00:29:33,336
So I've got like a decade on you.

530
00:29:34,256 --> 00:29:35,317
I'm going to be hitting those.

531
00:29:36,355 --> 00:29:37,676
I'm going to be needing some of that stuff.

532
00:29:38,157 --> 00:29:42,160
I'll tell you right now, you shocked the hell out of me when you told me you were 40 just now.

533
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,241
Like I hit it well, like I internalized it.

534
00:29:44,462 --> 00:29:47,584
Oh, you know what I did? I found out the video option in Zoom.

535
00:29:47,644 --> 00:29:48,625
I can touch up.

536
00:29:50,446 --> 00:29:54,569
Yeah, I'm actually just... The gray hair just goes away.

537
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,551
The hair appears.

538
00:29:56,631 --> 00:30:01,014
Man, I need whatever lotion you got, whatever you're using, man.

539
00:30:01,114 --> 00:30:03,356
Let me get some of that. It's called half Filipino, I think.

540
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:09,861
But I'm going to go to chat real quick for Becky Grady getting

541
00:30:09,881 --> 00:30:12,383
a decent amount of likes on this question.

542
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:16,926
So earlier you said no one's getting no one's going to be hurt by more options.

543
00:30:18,546 --> 00:30:21,708
And Becky points out in UX, though, there is often a balance

544
00:30:21,828 --> 00:30:24,650
of not making it too complicated or some maximum

545
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:27,292
where it could become too overwhelming to customize at all.

546
00:30:27,672 --> 00:30:30,614
How do you make sure you're providing the needed options

547
00:30:30,894 --> 00:30:34,316
without going so far that it's too hard to navigate?

548
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,357
That is a well thought out question.

549
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:37,698
Yeah, that's a wonderful question.

550
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,861
And ultimately, it comes down to player testing.

551
00:30:41,962 --> 00:30:45,024
You know, you want to bring in players that you can source this information with

552
00:30:45,565 --> 00:30:46,386
and obtain data.

553
00:30:46,566 --> 00:30:51,010
As a UX researcher, as a UX designer, you know that feedback is going to be the way that

554
00:30:51,951 --> 00:30:53,252
you obtain this information.

555
00:30:53,572 --> 00:30:57,436
And when it comes down to the menus and options that people are navigating on,

556
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:00,999
you're right, like that can become overly complex very easily.

557
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:05,121
I know, for example, sometimes you'll jump into an MMO

558
00:31:05,521 --> 00:31:07,382
and the amount of menus you're presented with is like,

559
00:31:07,562 --> 00:31:09,583
fam, I feel like I'm doing my taxes right now.

560
00:31:09,623 --> 00:31:10,544
I don't know what's going on.

561
00:31:10,624 --> 00:31:12,845
There's a lot of terms and numbers here.

562
00:31:13,506 --> 00:31:16,487
So the way to really navigate that

563
00:31:16,607 --> 00:31:18,188
is player testing and user testing.

564
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:22,110
Ultimately, I can't tell you what the right menu settings are,

565
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,592
but I sure can tell you that if you source about five to ten people

566
00:31:26,012 --> 00:31:28,494
and you ask them questions about their experience navigating the menu,

567
00:31:29,349 --> 00:31:32,390
Chances are you'll see certain issues rise to the top.

568
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:37,132
You'll probably see the same five issues rise to the top in terms of how people are navigating things.

569
00:31:39,153 --> 00:31:45,475
And ultimately, when you source those questions, when you do that research, which also takes time and also takes resources, not trying to downplay that.

570
00:31:46,163 --> 00:31:48,083
But when you do that, when you take that time,

571
00:31:48,143 --> 00:31:50,404
you do that research, that's something that's

572
00:31:50,844 --> 00:31:51,704
going to rise to the top.

573
00:31:52,104 --> 00:31:53,785
And ultimately, player testing and user testing,

574
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:57,466
that has to become a bigger part of the industry right now.

575
00:31:57,546 --> 00:32:01,647
It's simply necessary, because you're putting out a product

576
00:32:01,707 --> 00:32:03,908
and you don't know how people are going to feel about it

577
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:05,588
if you're not testing it.

578
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:06,368
Yeah.

579
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:09,349
Just to kind of segue this into this question

580
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:10,870
from Gabe Pofcher, which probably

581
00:32:14,108 --> 00:32:17,069
As related to what you just said, they asked,

582
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,671
what do you recommend for projects that may not have even $250

583
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:22,432
for accessibility feedback?

584
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:26,554
Is that just going to having people do you a favor

585
00:32:26,594 --> 00:32:29,336
and playtest your product, your game, or something?

586
00:32:29,863 --> 00:32:34,306
Yeah, I mean, what I'll say is, you know, first there are resources like accessible.games to check out.

587
00:32:35,326 --> 00:32:39,269
The other thing I'll say is there's plenty of news articles and things about

588
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:43,091
games that have good accessibility features that you can check out.

589
00:32:43,832 --> 00:32:49,355
Can I Play This is a great website that talks about, you know, game accessibility in various

590
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:54,939
games. And you can use those games to help inform how you're going to design your game.

591
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,283
I'm not trying to make it seem like this is an easy thing to do.

592
00:33:00,284 --> 00:33:05,428
But when I talk about there being $21 billion in discretionary income with people with disabilities,

593
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:12,515
there being 46 million people with disabilities in the U.S. with the World Health Organization

594
00:33:12,595 --> 00:33:17,520
estimating that there are 2 billion people on the planet that identify as having disabilities.

595
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,622
So that's not even counting people who don't identify as having disability.

596
00:33:21,563 --> 00:33:28,229
You're talking about a huge population that is going to want access to these experiences,

597
00:33:28,409 --> 00:33:34,715
especially as we, you know, we move to almost 3 billion players on the planet that play games.

598
00:33:34,835 --> 00:33:39,299
There's, you're bound to be overlapped with people who have disabilities as well.

599
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,844
So, you know, really and truly what it is, is it's a value proposition.

600
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,932
And when it comes to not having the resources

601
00:33:49,353 --> 00:33:51,134
to do something like that, I totally understand that.

602
00:33:53,055 --> 00:33:56,277
But doing things like betas also help to get feedback as well,

603
00:33:56,297 --> 00:33:58,058
because you can see how people are interacting with your game.

604
00:33:59,199 --> 00:34:00,820
But ultimately, time and research.

605
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,821
In the same way that you've studied

606
00:34:02,881 --> 00:34:07,244
to learn how to design a game, accessibility

607
00:34:07,384 --> 00:34:11,326
is something that is here to stay.

608
00:34:11,426 --> 00:34:11,947
It's happening.

609
00:34:12,207 --> 00:34:13,368
And unfortunately,

610
00:34:14,348 --> 00:34:18,272
There are folks that have not realized that and are lagging behind.

611
00:34:18,653 --> 00:34:25,420
But we have things like the CVAA, the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act.

612
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,141
It's a mouthful.

613
00:34:27,162 --> 00:34:30,365
That legally says that certain people need to have access to these experiences.

614
00:34:31,326 --> 00:34:34,269
And other countries around the world are also starting to adapt things like that too.

615
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:35,430
So it's...

616
00:34:36,151 --> 00:34:49,878
The landscape is changing from a legality perspective, it has changed from a financial perspective, and the numbers of people that you can potentially have access to has increased as well and continues to increase.

617
00:34:50,218 --> 00:34:53,240
So, you know, the world is changing, the landscape is changing.

618
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:58,392
Hopefully, we'll be able to do what we can as an organization,

619
00:34:58,412 --> 00:35:00,914
and I mean AbleGamers, to alleviate that.

620
00:35:01,194 --> 00:35:03,156
And that's part of the research that we're doing

621
00:35:03,176 --> 00:35:05,277
to try and put out there, too, to change that landscape,

622
00:35:05,297 --> 00:35:07,239
because we know it's hard, and we know it's difficult.

623
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:13,103
So what we need to do now is ...

624
00:35:13,223 --> 00:35:15,985
Well, we're going to ... Okay, how are we going to do this?

625
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:19,107
We're going to switch over to basically a word

626
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:24,491
from our sponsor, a pre-recorded interview that we did.

627
00:35:25,304 --> 00:35:32,029
And, uh, but when that's done, uh, Greg is going to come back with us.

628
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:35,171
And there's going to be two more Gamasutra editors.

629
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,728
It's really engaging banter about current gaming.

630
00:35:38,768 --> 00:35:42,849
Yeah, yeah, no, but we can we can keep on talking to Greg too after that.

631
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:49,711
So if we could roll that beautiful beam footage, is that now it's like the.

632
00:35:50,292 --> 00:35:58,555
Yeah, so we're going to go ahead and switch over to that right now and we'll be back in about.

633
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:06,001
Up next, we'd like to welcome one of our sponsors, Burak Wardel, CEO and co-founder of Istanbul-based

634
00:36:06,061 --> 00:36:10,962
hyper-casual mobile game publisher Rolik, purveyor of chart-topping games including

635
00:36:11,122 --> 00:36:18,904
GoNuts 3D and Tanglemaster 3D. And before Rolik, Burak was at mobile advertising company AdColony

636
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:24,385
as head of growth and client solutions in charge of the EMEA and Latin America territories.

637
00:36:24,846 --> 00:36:29,207
Hey Burak, how's it going? All good, all good, Chris. Good.

638
00:36:29,765 --> 00:36:31,488
Thanks for joining us. Appreciate it.

639
00:36:32,229 --> 00:36:34,932
So for those who aren't familiar,

640
00:36:35,053 --> 00:36:37,396
can you tell us a little bit about Ralliq

641
00:36:37,736 --> 00:36:38,477
and what you do there?

642
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,693
Actually, Relic is a hyper-casual developer and publisher based in Istanbul.

643
00:36:44,094 --> 00:36:50,059
So we are working with third-party development partner studios to develop hyper-casual games,

644
00:36:50,139 --> 00:36:54,423
and also we have an internal studio that we produce our own hyper-casual games.

645
00:36:55,484 --> 00:37:00,449
And we are in Istanbul and we are controlling an ecosystem of almost a thousand developers and

646
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:04,753
designers. Oh wow. And what do you do there personally?

647
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:12,079
I'm the CEO, so I'm managing the databases, I'm managing business, publishing, and product

648
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:13,222
teams of the company.

649
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:18,892
And can you tell us about some of the more successful games that Relic has published?

650
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:29,785
Yeah, actually until August we published 30 games in total and I think almost 20 of

651
00:37:29,845 --> 00:37:37,173
them became the most downloaded game in the United States and actually in Q2 in the period

652
00:37:37,313 --> 00:37:38,955
of April, May and June.

653
00:37:39,775 --> 00:37:43,916
Rolig developed the most downloaded top two games of the United States,

654
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:47,457
App Store, GoNuts 3D, and Tangle Monster 3D.

655
00:37:47,777 --> 00:37:53,218
So I think those are the latest big ones, so I can tell those as an answer.

656
00:37:53,658 --> 00:37:59,819
Yeah, great. And I feel like this genre is kind of off of a lot of people in the game industry's

657
00:37:59,899 --> 00:38:05,740
radar, so can you define what you think a hyper-casual game is?

658
00:38:06,774 --> 00:38:12,481
Yeah, actually in the industry there are a lot of talks about genres and they're

659
00:38:12,521 --> 00:38:17,586
creating new genres like super casual, hybrid casual, ultra casual. We mainly don't believe

660
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:22,431
those a lot. So we believe that there are certain rules of game design that you can apply to the

661
00:38:22,491 --> 00:38:24,834
mobile game you have at that moment.

662
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:27,975
But of course, hypercasual is a big and popular genre.

663
00:38:27,995 --> 00:38:34,819
So I can define a hypercasual game as a simple mechanic giving a huge fun for the society.

664
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:44,504
And also the main point of a hypercasual game is it should be played by everyone without any

665
00:38:44,584 --> 00:38:50,848
gender, age or anything. It should be a mass appealing game and a successful one.

666
00:38:51,859 --> 00:39:01,812
Yeah, can you can you describe the gameplay of like go nuts, for example, so that they're kind of like very tactile seeming right?

667
00:39:02,553 --> 00:39:08,121
Yeah, actually, actually, the fun moment of that is I'm tying the knots, right? So

668
00:39:08,761 --> 00:39:14,588
There are tight knots and you are trying to untie them with the simple sort mechanic you use.

669
00:39:14,648 --> 00:39:16,050
It's the same with the Tangle Master.

670
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:23,959
So in the Tangle Master, you also try to break the ropes and try to have a clean level end.

671
00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:32,201
So it's a very simple fun but it's very satisfying when you achieve the win in the level. So it's a

672
00:39:32,241 --> 00:39:39,023
very simplistic mechanic and a simplistic game design but gives a huge satisfaction and fun to

673
00:39:39,063 --> 00:39:45,684
the user. So that's actually what a successful hyper casual game is. Yeah it's almost like

674
00:39:45,785 --> 00:39:46,325
therapeutic.

675
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:55,273
Now, Relic has seemed to gain a lot of traction pretty quickly as, you know, Relic is still a young company.

676
00:39:56,314 --> 00:39:58,956
So what do you attribute the fast growth to?

677
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:07,616
Actually, we are an 18-month-old company, so we are very young in terms of the history of Rolex.

678
00:40:07,736 --> 00:40:12,721
But I think the biggest value over there is in hyper-casual, many of the publishers

679
00:40:13,341 --> 00:40:18,906
are acting like performance marketing companies, and many of the developers are acting like

680
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:24,650
outsourced development. But in Rolex community, we have a huge gaming culture. So I think the

681
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:25,971
value of success...

682
00:40:26,552 --> 00:40:37,204
And without measuring the timeline of the company, I think the biggest value there is having the proper game component product culture in whatever you do in your business.

683
00:40:37,224 --> 00:40:41,670
So if it's hyper-casual, if it's casual, it's the same for every game production.

684
00:40:43,271 --> 00:40:51,755
The reason Rolex succeeded this fast is the hirings and the culture of the team in terms of gaming,

685
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,836
not like performance marketing or outsource development.

686
00:40:54,897 --> 00:40:58,518
We have a big gaming culture and every day in Rolex office,

687
00:40:58,818 --> 00:41:03,261
the only topic is the games our team is playing or we are producing actually.

688
00:41:04,521 --> 00:41:07,523
And you work very closely with the developers, right?

689
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:20,005
So when you are collaborating on games with them, what are some of the design principles that you adhere to when you're guiding your development partners?

690
00:41:20,306 --> 00:41:28,394
Yeah, actually, we are partnering our developers from brainstorming level of the idea to the scaling part. So there's a huge story over there.

691
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:35,398
We are fast, so we are preparing a game to its launch in mostly in one month maximum,

692
00:41:35,778 --> 00:41:40,701
but in the meantime we are covering a lot of details about the game together.

693
00:41:40,781 --> 00:41:45,844
Like in the first prototype we always try to coach them in terms of how many levels do they need

694
00:41:46,125 --> 00:41:50,367
to test the game properly, what should be the exact mechanic of the game,

695
00:41:50,487 --> 00:41:52,488
or what should the progression look like.

696
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:54,269
and when we are producing the game.

697
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:57,810
After games show a potential in the metrics we test,

698
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:59,450
then comes the updates.

699
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,711
Updates are like bigger schedules for the game

700
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:05,452
that we are giving the feedbacks to the studio

701
00:42:05,472 --> 00:42:07,593
in terms of every detail of the mechanic,

702
00:42:07,713 --> 00:42:09,854
every detail of every level we produce.

703
00:42:10,114 --> 00:42:13,455
So we are trying to be as clear and as...

704
00:42:14,295 --> 00:42:17,717
Transparent as we can in terms of the idea they are producing.

705
00:42:17,817 --> 00:42:25,042
And also, but the thing we don't coach or don't tell them is the execution quality and the development they do.

706
00:42:25,062 --> 00:42:29,945
So that should be coming from the studio as a know-how and as a...

707
00:42:30,665 --> 00:42:36,808
experience, but the rest of the game, the design parts, like level design, like progression, like

708
00:42:36,868 --> 00:42:42,389
characters, and like the general color palettes of the game, are all coached by Rolick to its

709
00:42:42,409 --> 00:42:47,691
studio partners during the production period. And Rolick also is involved in something

710
00:42:47,751 --> 00:42:51,953
interesting called the Rolick Hub. Can you talk about that a little bit?

711
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:57,597
Yeah, actually, so we know the physical value when we're producing games together with our

712
00:42:57,637 --> 00:43:02,802
partners, especially in hyper-casual, because these games don't have detailed game design

713
00:43:02,842 --> 00:43:07,666
documents, they don't have a big background. On that moment, you think of an idea, and if

714
00:43:07,826 --> 00:43:09,868
your studio partner is a quality partner,

715
00:43:10,288 --> 00:43:14,509
they will be probably able to develop that mechanic in like three hours, right?

716
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:19,669
So when you have those partners in your office working every day with you,

717
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:23,650
then you are able to try more mechanics, new designs, etc.

718
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:26,751
So something comes up to your mind, you talk on that moment,

719
00:43:26,851 --> 00:43:30,231
and you develop and play it right away and check the feeling of the game.

720
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:34,772
So Rolling Hubs is the idea of getting product,

721
00:43:34,932 --> 00:43:38,353
like keeping that in the soul.

722
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:44,700
during production, but also doing a very successful business together with our partners.

723
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:51,233
We are providing them shared offices in our Istanbul HQ and in Ankara, the capital of Turkey,

724
00:43:51,513 --> 00:43:56,236
and soon in Izmir, the third biggest city, and we are producing together with our studios on

725
00:43:56,276 --> 00:44:02,339
daily basis. And this Woodshop, it was a huge release from our Game Hub, and also the latest

726
00:44:02,419 --> 00:44:08,842
release, Fast Driver, which is the first first-person driving game of Hypercasual History,

727
00:44:08,862 --> 00:44:10,663
was also a game from our Game Hub.

728
00:44:11,488 --> 00:44:16,432
Very cool. And just to wrap things up for game developers who are looking to get into this

729
00:44:16,652 --> 00:44:20,474
hyper-casual mobile space, do you have any advice that you could give them?

730
00:44:21,595 --> 00:44:30,461
Yeah, actually I think first advice is always courage. So don't be afraid, but don't confuse

731
00:44:30,521 --> 00:44:35,905
of producing prototypes with releasing successful games. So in hyper-casual,

732
00:44:37,432 --> 00:44:40,734
Producing prototypes looks relatively easy compared to

733
00:44:41,775 --> 00:44:44,576
really releasing a huge hyper-casual title. So

734
00:44:45,157 --> 00:44:49,620
every day you need to do better execution, better ideas, and you need to

735
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:53,142
continue testing. And in terms of your partners, choose

736
00:44:53,182 --> 00:44:56,825
your partners very well. If you're a developer, please choose a

737
00:44:56,925 --> 00:45:01,748
proper game artist or a game designer as a partner, or vice versa. If you're a

738
00:45:01,808 --> 00:45:05,410
successful game artist, find a good developer partner that you

739
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:06,111
can pair with.

740
00:45:06,351 --> 00:45:11,334
You don't need like 10 people to produce a proper hypercasual game. Three, four people will be

741
00:45:11,374 --> 00:45:16,677
enough. And I think choosing the right partners is the key over there to make a sustainable and

742
00:45:16,737 --> 00:45:22,541
future-proof ecosystem in hypercasual industry. That's great. Well, Burak, thanks so much for

743
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:28,064
joining us and best of luck. And thank you very much, Chris. It was a pleasure. Thank you.

744
00:45:30,205 --> 00:45:33,748
And we're back. Found two more people somewhere.

745
00:45:35,415 --> 00:45:38,397
So, we're going to start off with a quick introduction.

746
00:45:39,338 --> 00:45:42,339
We decided that Greg was too lonely.

747
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:46,842
He needed to be confronted by a toll road.

748
00:45:46,862 --> 00:45:49,263
We don't have repeat guests.

749
00:45:49,704 --> 00:45:53,666
We've got the normal hoodlums from Gamasutra.

750
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:55,327
Bryant Francis.

751
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:56,087
Hey, Bryant.

752
00:45:57,028 --> 00:45:57,828
I'm not a hoodlum.

753
00:45:57,948 --> 00:45:58,809
I'm a highwayman.

754
00:45:59,049 --> 00:45:59,629
You're all good.

755
00:45:59,649 --> 00:46:04,072
That's something I should've announced.

756
00:46:04,953 --> 00:46:05,413
Correctly.

757
00:46:05,793 --> 00:46:06,313
You nailed it.

758
00:46:06,353 --> 00:46:08,154
And here I am in standard hoodlum attire.

759
00:46:08,294 --> 00:46:08,775
Let's go.

760
00:46:09,235 --> 00:46:10,475
Yeah, let's do it.

761
00:46:10,755 --> 00:46:12,056
I want to keep on talking to Greg

762
00:46:12,116 --> 00:46:14,297
because whatever about you guys.

763
00:46:14,657 --> 00:46:16,018
All right, see you later.

764
00:46:17,298 --> 00:46:20,640
No, but Greg, first of all,

765
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:22,100
thanks for sticking around for the bean footage.

766
00:46:22,501 --> 00:46:23,181
A pleasure.

767
00:46:23,561 --> 00:46:26,402
And then, but you announced something

768
00:46:26,462 --> 00:46:27,823
very developer centric,

769
00:46:27,863 --> 00:46:29,764
which I think would be appropriate for here.

770
00:46:30,184 --> 00:46:30,564
Your D-pad.

771
00:46:32,016 --> 00:46:33,819
That's what you call it.

772
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:33,939
Yes.

773
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:35,801
So the D-Pad initiative actually launched today,

774
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:40,448
stands for Developers Promoting Accessibility and Diversity in the Space.

775
00:46:41,269 --> 00:46:43,131
And really what D-Pad is about,

776
00:46:43,872 --> 00:46:47,778
it's about giving people free access to the AbleGamers practitioner course.

777
00:46:48,619 --> 00:46:51,521
So that's a course that we developed to fund our mission

778
00:46:51,681 --> 00:46:54,303
and also to teach developers about accessibility.

779
00:46:55,243 --> 00:46:57,445
Normally the course's price is $2,000 for a seat.

780
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,927
It's a two-day course, extensive course,

781
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:02,048
that goes into how to use the free tool

782
00:47:02,088 --> 00:47:04,230
that we present on accessible.games,

783
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:08,973
how to win the sort of arguments around accessibility

784
00:47:10,034 --> 00:47:12,936
in your respective companies,

785
00:47:13,216 --> 00:47:15,778
how to establish a culture and community of accessibility.

786
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:21,802
in your companies and ultimately to just coalesce around more accessible design thinking,

787
00:47:22,162 --> 00:47:26,866
generative accessible design thinking. So D-Pad is something that sort of emerged

788
00:47:27,626 --> 00:47:34,671
out of our need to do something in a community to bring improved inclusion in the space.

789
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:50,062
Um, you know, this year in particular, um, we've seen so much happen from a diversity perspective that really reflects how far we need to go, um, how far we've come but also how much further we need to go in order to have an inclusive safe, safe

790
00:47:50,082 --> 00:47:57,446
space not just in the gaming community. But, you know, in the larger, you know, environment as a whole, and on our planet in our country in our planet.

791
00:47:58,187 --> 00:47:58,287
Um,

792
00:47:59,169 --> 00:48:06,578
You know, from the notion that Black lives matter, from the truth that Black lives matter, not even the notion, the truth that Black lives do matter.

793
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:19,253
The fact that there are trans folk, trans folks experiencing extreme violence and losing their lives because of their chosen identity, the things that we've seen women

794
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:34,961
I have to endure in the gaming industry from a discrimination and from a just inappropriate behavior standpoint, we realized that the, the only way to really to really change the industry is to start changing it on the, on the developer

795
00:48:35,001 --> 00:48:38,423
side of things to start changing those environments and.

796
00:48:39,622 --> 00:48:42,923
Ultimately, create cultures there that are inclusive,

797
00:48:43,443 --> 00:48:46,024
and hopefully make games that are inclusive and representative

798
00:48:46,485 --> 00:48:47,805
of the people that are playing these games.

799
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:51,647
People of color, people with disabilities, women,

800
00:48:52,687 --> 00:48:56,109
people that are members of the LGBTQIA community.

801
00:48:56,909 --> 00:49:01,131
So with D-Pad, we wanted to create an initiative where we can

802
00:49:01,331 --> 00:49:04,092
essentially have developers who are interested in taking that course

803
00:49:04,192 --> 00:49:07,073
and learning about accessibility, developers from diverse backgrounds,

804
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:08,334
such as the one that I just mentioned,

805
00:49:08,734 --> 00:49:14,757
Apply to this course, apply to this program to be able to join up and get a free session of the course.

806
00:49:15,798 --> 00:49:21,000
So if you head over to ablegamers.org slash dpad, you'll find the application there.

807
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,081
You can submit application super short.

808
00:49:23,721 --> 00:49:29,664
We want to keep it concise because I realize people, people about to spend two days with us potentially doing this course.

809
00:49:29,704 --> 00:49:31,645
So we don't want to have you spend too long on the application.

810
00:49:33,548 --> 00:50:00,255
And yeah, just, just apply and join up. You have nothing to lose. If you're if you're from, you know, a marginalized group, you know, apply, we definitely want to see you and we definitely want to hear from you. And, you know, from, from my experience, you know, as a black man in this environment, I realized that there, there's so much, there's so much inequality, and hatred towards groups that don't deserve it. These are things that

811
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:06,272
We can't change and even if we could we wouldn't. It's who we are. And I say we when I, you know,

812
00:50:06,292 --> 00:50:10,693
I speak about, you know, my blackness, you know, and obviously I don't want to speak for other

813
00:50:10,733 --> 00:50:15,795
groups that I don't necessarily identify as but I know that we all are the way we want we are.

814
00:50:16,495 --> 00:50:20,256
And we, we embrace that. And

815
00:50:21,257 --> 00:50:27,145
It's the way it is, and we need to make sure that the community opens those doors for those

816
00:50:27,165 --> 00:50:28,647
people to feel welcome.

817
00:50:29,107 --> 00:50:32,993
This community is an amazing community, but it has an ugly side.

818
00:50:33,273 --> 00:50:36,397
The gaming community has an ugly side to it, and we got to stomp that out.

819
00:50:37,018 --> 00:50:38,659
Like, enough is enough already.

820
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,641
So we got to get rid of that.

821
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:46,065
And I hope that DPAD can start making that progress

822
00:50:46,966 --> 00:50:52,310
towards alleviating some of the biases that are in the game

823
00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:54,732
development space, and sort of improving the numbers

824
00:50:54,772 --> 00:50:56,994
so that there's less of the sameness

825
00:50:57,194 --> 00:50:59,736
that we currently see in the gaming environment,

826
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:02,018
so that other voices can be elevated

827
00:51:02,278 --> 00:51:04,600
and other experiences can be shared and told.

828
00:51:06,135 --> 00:51:07,495
Is there even anything else to be said?

829
00:51:07,515 --> 00:51:13,698
We've got like eight minutes left and like that is straight up mic drop and that's beautiful.

830
00:51:14,018 --> 00:51:20,181
And you know, it goes, you know, just the fact that, you know, the idea, the concept of accessibility

831
00:51:20,761 --> 00:51:26,463
goes, you know, beyond just a lot of people think, oh, you know, helping disabled people

832
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:32,306
play games, which that's part of it, but there's, it's, it's a woven into.

833
00:51:33,086 --> 00:51:34,468
All the things that you're talking about.

834
00:51:34,908 --> 00:51:39,574
Yeah, and we want developers who have disabilities to apply this program too.

835
00:51:39,895 --> 00:51:42,778
Because that's another stigma in the space right now, which is,

836
00:51:43,279 --> 00:51:45,562
oh, we don't know how to hire people with disabilities.

837
00:51:46,123 --> 00:51:46,583
And I'm like...

838
00:51:47,522 --> 00:51:53,967
Like, there are plenty of people that are out there that have disabilities that want to be developers or want to work on the gaming side of things.

839
00:51:54,548 --> 00:52:00,593
You know, we've seen Cherry Thompson get hired at Ubisoft, which is an amazing hire.

840
00:52:00,613 --> 00:52:01,594
Hi, Cherry, if you're listening.

841
00:52:02,455 --> 00:52:04,216
She's in chat, yeah.

842
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:05,097
Oh, what up, Cherry?

843
00:52:07,441 --> 00:52:13,923
You know, so Cherry, you know, is an example of bringing folks who have disabilities who are vocal about the disabilities,

844
00:52:13,943 --> 00:52:23,565
who are expressive about their disabilities and the experiences that the game industry needs to start, like, changing their minds towards, you know, hiring people that have these experiences.

845
00:52:24,045 --> 00:52:27,486
It's an important part of making sure that this community can grow.

846
00:52:28,425 --> 00:52:33,048
Um, and you know, and I'll be honest with you too, like it benefits these companies

847
00:52:33,128 --> 00:52:37,191
are trying to make money to, to, to, to have other people in the community.

848
00:52:37,731 --> 00:52:38,192
You know what I mean?

849
00:52:38,232 --> 00:52:40,973
Like it's, it's not an altruistic thing.

850
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:45,116
I know to include other people, you know, in order to, to grow your, your business.

851
00:52:45,176 --> 00:52:48,818
So like, it doesn't hurt anybody, but bigots, honestly, so

852
00:52:48,879 --> 00:52:50,500
your perspectives make better games.

853
00:52:51,633 --> 00:52:56,316
I mean, I couldn't have said it better, you know, and I hope to see that, I hope to see

854
00:52:56,336 --> 00:53:01,559
D-pad, you know, be the, be the starter for that in terms of what we could do on our end.

855
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,801
You know, we're not, we're not Nike, you know, we can't give out a hundred million dollars

856
00:53:05,301 --> 00:53:11,725
towards a specific movement because ultimately anybody who decides to support our organization,

857
00:53:12,485 --> 00:53:15,968
you know, they've chosen us to be custodians of the money that they've given us.

858
00:53:16,768 --> 00:53:36,928
And we feel as custodians, a great way to support our mission is to train developers from diverse backgrounds in accessibility to ultimately help the community that we set out to by starting AbleGamers and also to grow the space in terms of a diverse, inclusive perspective.

859
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:40,711
Hey, real quick, just sliding in with a tiny, tiny correction.

860
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:44,272
We referred to Cherry in the third person a couple of seconds ago.

861
00:53:44,932 --> 00:53:49,513
Cherry is one of our great GDC speakers, and they use they, them pronouns.

862
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:51,234
Yes. So just quickly.

863
00:53:51,274 --> 00:53:51,994
Oh, yes. Thank you.

864
00:53:52,194 --> 00:53:56,655
Just to clarify that and make sure, you know, this live episode

865
00:53:56,675 --> 00:53:59,516
doesn't contain any bad feelings after this is done.

866
00:53:59,596 --> 00:54:01,297
So absolutely. Thank you.

867
00:54:01,537 --> 00:54:02,417
If I did do that.

868
00:54:03,117 --> 00:54:03,997
I appreciate.

869
00:54:04,037 --> 00:54:07,278
Thank you, Triskel, for asterisking that in chat.

870
00:54:08,472 --> 00:54:15,758
Yeah, and on the topic of hurting bigots, I saw a great, I saw a great talk today at GDC Summer.

871
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:21,563
That is a different tack in a different sphere, but I think is sort of similar in some key points.

872
00:54:21,663 --> 00:54:24,206
Brenda Romero gave a talk this morning, I don't know if anybody caught it,

873
00:54:24,826 --> 00:54:29,070
on hidden histories of women in computing. And a key point of that talk, which is going to be

874
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:33,594
available on the platform for everyone to watch on demand if you missed it, is that

875
00:54:34,745 --> 00:54:39,228
Women are not fairly represented in leadership roles and in creative roles, both in tech and in games.

876
00:54:40,369 --> 00:54:44,051
And one of her key arguments was that, you know, having a mostly male-dominated industry,

877
00:54:44,091 --> 00:54:48,474
a mostly white male-dominated industry, creates a lot of situations where women are physically

878
00:54:48,534 --> 00:54:52,756
uncomfortable, whether it's cold offices or, you know, badly designed games or whatever.

879
00:54:53,797 --> 00:54:57,979
And so she basically made a big call for gender parity, making a good case of like,

880
00:54:58,139 --> 00:55:01,802
basically, the more diverse teams you have, the better games they're going to make.

881
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:03,800
because they're going to bring their own perspectives

882
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,181
and their own experiences to the work.

883
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:07,603
And it seems like we're seeing a lot of calls

884
00:55:07,643 --> 00:55:09,584
for that across the industry, and it's great.

885
00:55:09,784 --> 00:55:12,546
Let's just keep doing it. Let's just keep, never stop.

886
00:55:13,066 --> 00:55:15,448
Yeah, we got to keep that same heat that we had,

887
00:55:15,628 --> 00:55:18,169
you know, when we saw everything happen with George Floyd,

888
00:55:18,209 --> 00:55:20,551
when we saw him, we saw the brutality

889
00:55:20,591 --> 00:55:21,952
that was shown towards a human being,

890
00:55:22,332 --> 00:55:23,653
and we all started recognizing that.

891
00:55:23,693 --> 00:55:26,475
When we see all the people in the industry

892
00:55:26,515 --> 00:55:28,256
being outed for their behavior towards women,

893
00:55:28,636 --> 00:55:30,457
like, that heat that we have right now

894
00:55:30,537 --> 00:55:31,458
about trying to improve that.

895
00:55:32,229 --> 00:55:35,051
Like, if this hasn't changed a year from now, we got to have that same fire.

896
00:55:35,212 --> 00:55:39,475
Because every time we let up, every time we let up in terms of, you know,

897
00:55:40,516 --> 00:55:45,160
appealing for more equality and diversity, we take five steps back.

898
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,122
And enough is enough. I'm tired. I know I'm tired.

899
00:55:48,643 --> 00:55:50,584
And I know that I'm not the only one who feels that way.

900
00:55:51,105 --> 00:55:55,807
But at the end of the day, there's a generation that's coming after us that needs to see a better

901
00:55:55,827 --> 00:56:01,731
world. And the generation that exists right now, we deserve a better world. So we got to keep

902
00:56:01,751 --> 00:56:07,934
pushing in that respect. Absolutely. Did you guys see any fun talks about herding bigots?

903
00:56:09,355 --> 00:56:16,179
Yeah, yeah. It was very specific. If you want to read about that talk,

904
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:18,740
you can find a write-up by Alex on gamasutra.com.

905
00:56:22,386 --> 00:56:22,826
Nice one.

906
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:25,027
We do work for GammaCitra.com, don't we?

907
00:56:25,427 --> 00:56:26,728
A website with a name.

908
00:56:27,288 --> 00:56:29,349
Yeah.

909
00:56:29,369 --> 00:56:30,529
We didn't really talk too much.

910
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:34,111
We have a little bit of time left, like four minutes.

911
00:56:35,811 --> 00:56:39,533
I'm wondering, like, working with, like, I mentioned right at the beginning

912
00:56:39,593 --> 00:56:42,974
that you work with these big companies, some of them large publishers.

913
00:56:42,994 --> 00:56:43,075
Yeah.

914
00:56:43,095 --> 00:56:44,995
We work with a lot of big companies, some of them large publishers.

915
00:56:45,175 --> 00:56:46,897
What do you get from those?

916
00:56:46,977 --> 00:56:51,460
Like when when you're consulting with them, are you kind of like surprised

917
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,242
at the culture or are you,

918
00:56:55,262 --> 00:56:57,824
you know, are they usually receptive?

919
00:56:58,684 --> 00:56:59,825
How does that usually go for you?

920
00:57:01,046 --> 00:57:02,747
I think I think it certainly varies.

921
00:57:04,188 --> 00:57:08,511
I think. If I have to be honest, I think I think companies,

922
00:57:08,571 --> 00:57:12,073
it's not that they're receptive, it's that they're somewhat apprehensive.

923
00:57:13,644 --> 00:57:17,546
And, you know, like, for example, personally, I don't identify as having a disability.

924
00:57:18,206 --> 00:57:21,628
And I like to make that clear when I talk about the community, because I always say, like,

925
00:57:21,648 --> 00:57:26,350
you know, I speak about their needs and the community as opposed to me.

926
00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:29,091
So I'm not I don't necessarily identify as being part of that community.

927
00:57:29,551 --> 00:57:32,793
But even myself, it took me a long time to get comfortable with asking questions.

928
00:57:33,473 --> 00:57:38,696
That ultimately serve the knowledge that I'll need to have in order to benefit the community I want to help.

929
00:57:39,276 --> 00:57:49,582
And I think at least with the companies I've worked with, I can't speak for every company out there, but at least the companies I've had the pleasure of working with, it's more so that it's...

930
00:57:51,212 --> 00:57:56,177
It's a lack of knowledge, you know, that really makes creates sort of apprehension.

931
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:02,664
And to that we try to offer a safe space where you can ask questions about the community

932
00:58:03,766 --> 00:58:08,431
to further inform yourself because ultimately, like asking questions with respect, obviously

933
00:58:08,491 --> 00:58:09,893
we know we're not talking about like, you know.

934
00:58:10,581 --> 00:58:15,185
being, you know, rude or bigoted in how you address the community.

935
00:58:15,685 --> 00:58:21,890
But, you know, asking questions about the experiences that we try to share with these

936
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:24,853
companies in order to improve their approaches to accessibility.

937
00:58:24,873 --> 00:58:25,213
In terms of...

938
00:58:25,233 --> 00:58:25,453
In terms of...

939
00:58:25,473 --> 00:58:25,653
I'm sorry.

940
00:58:25,673 --> 00:58:25,853
I'm sorry.

941
00:58:25,873 --> 00:58:26,154
I'm sorry.

942
00:58:26,174 --> 00:58:26,434
I'm sorry.

943
00:58:26,454 --> 00:58:26,634
I'm sorry.

944
00:58:26,654 --> 00:58:26,874
I'm sorry.

945
00:58:26,894 --> 00:58:27,114
I'm sorry.

946
00:58:27,134 --> 00:58:27,335
I'm sorry.

947
00:58:27,355 --> 00:58:27,535
I'm sorry.

948
00:58:27,555 --> 00:58:27,735
I'm sorry.

949
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:27,935
I'm sorry.

950
00:58:27,955 --> 00:58:28,135
I'm sorry.

951
00:58:28,542 --> 00:58:30,043
You know, common questions we might get.

952
00:58:30,204 --> 00:58:31,805
We got a lot of questions about like, you know,

953
00:58:32,225 --> 00:58:34,567
what should I do first from an accessibility standpoint?

954
00:58:34,647 --> 00:58:36,849
And like, that's a tough question to answer.

955
00:58:37,029 --> 00:58:39,471
I can say from the players that we've polled,

956
00:58:39,691 --> 00:58:41,352
from the players that we've talked to in player panels,

957
00:58:41,392 --> 00:58:45,095
that a lot of the people ask for things like key remapping.

958
00:58:45,115 --> 00:58:48,698
A lot of people ask for, you know, proper subtitling.

959
00:58:48,778 --> 00:58:51,600
That includes increasing text size,

960
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,522
that means, or decreasing text size if you need to,

961
00:58:53,582 --> 00:58:54,642
or turning it off completely.

962
00:58:55,563 --> 00:59:08,454
Having backgrounds for those subtitles, being able to change the color of both the text and the background to match what you want from a contrasting standpoint, including the speaker name as well if there's multiple speakers speaking in a game.

963
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:19,443
We see a lot about recoloring, so colorblind options, being able to turn off sort of the background noise that might be coming from the game or flashes might be coming from a game.

964
00:59:20,404 --> 00:59:20,524
Um...

965
00:59:21,611 --> 00:59:24,833
We also see a lot about timed actions.

966
00:59:25,413 --> 00:59:29,536
So things that require you to have quick reflexes,

967
00:59:30,216 --> 00:59:32,597
QTEs being a big one, quick time events.

968
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:34,679
So it kind of varies.

969
00:59:34,859 --> 00:59:39,161
And ultimately, I'd say start somewhere

970
00:59:39,922 --> 00:59:42,043
and continue to iterate from that respect.

971
00:59:42,567 --> 00:59:44,568
But we get a lot of questions.

972
00:59:44,628 --> 00:59:45,849
It's hard to think of them right now.

973
00:59:45,889 --> 00:59:47,570
We definitely get a lot of questions in that regard.

974
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:50,351
Oh, and you know, we've got like 17 seconds left.

975
00:59:50,371 --> 00:59:51,732
I'm watching the timer go down.

976
00:59:51,772 --> 00:59:53,093
Perfect.

977
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:53,773
Perfect.

978
00:59:54,694 --> 00:59:59,157
Yeah, but, you know, people can probably go to what resources,

979
00:59:59,217 --> 01:00:01,918
what website, you know, ablegamers.org.

980
01:00:02,078 --> 01:00:03,119
All right, let's make this quick.

981
01:00:03,379 --> 01:00:05,801
ablegamers.org, accessible.games.

982
01:00:06,581 --> 01:00:08,442
Follow us on Twitter at AbleGamers.

983
01:00:09,924 --> 01:00:11,467
You can follow myself on Twitter at Greg,

984
01:00:11,667 --> 01:00:13,109
Jay, Hazy, Jayson, Jaguar.

985
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:17,517
And go to ablegamers.org slash dpad if you're a developer

986
01:00:18,138 --> 01:00:20,101
and you come from a marginalized background

987
01:00:20,181 --> 01:00:21,383
and you want to learn about accessibility.

988
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:24,912
Amazing. And that is a great place to stop.

989
01:00:25,332 --> 01:00:26,652
And thank you so much, Greg.

990
01:00:27,453 --> 01:00:28,413
Thanks to the crew.

991
01:00:28,433 --> 01:00:30,854
And thank you, seriously, everybody in chat.

992
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:32,295
You're like, you're so wonderful.

993
01:00:33,036 --> 01:00:36,237
So thanks for joining us for this special episode.

994
01:00:36,297 --> 01:00:38,718
And we're going to be doing these live ones again tomorrow

995
01:00:39,098 --> 01:00:41,480
and the next day after that, whichever day that is.

996
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,361
Thanks everyone.

997
01:00:43,381 --> 01:00:44,321
Good to be here.

998
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:44,541
Bye.

999
01:00:44,881 --> 01:00:45,161
Bye.
